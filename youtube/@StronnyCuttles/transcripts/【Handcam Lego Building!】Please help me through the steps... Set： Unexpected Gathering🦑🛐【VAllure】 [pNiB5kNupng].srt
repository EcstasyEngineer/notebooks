00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hi, Baudry Flay. What do you think of it, Mrs. Flay? Do you want to imagine it, Mrs. Flay?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh, Brie Flay! I can't do that, but...

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Ooh.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I need a check.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's very hard to pivot the camera to...

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm not piloting a mech. I'm a real VTuber, by the way. I'm a real VTuber.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I will not admit I'm piloting a mech, even though I might be.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hi, Reefling. You see me? You hear me?

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm talking to the Baudry Flings, don't mind me.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hi! Can you hear me?

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
No, I've not got any background music or anything on purpose.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I can put something there if you want.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Can you see the outline of your pintas?

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No, I can't see. This is the webcam, so yes, there's a shadow cast.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I can't do anything about it.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What interests the nail colour scheme? What does Analyze the colours for no particular reason?

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hmm. Look at that green and purple.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hmm. Curious. Green and purple.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hmm. What does it mean?

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What does it mean? We don't know.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay. Are you ready?

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Time to put it on!

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Here's my good Reefling.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Are you ready?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hmm. Well, I'll put it on you.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What do you think?

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I think it looks really awesome.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'll put you on that.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Reefling!

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Where'd you say go? That's right, you're getting me. Good.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh wait! But wait!

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Bailey May is here with a special TV offer.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But wait! There's more!

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Hold on.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Hold on.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If I can get it open.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I can't get...

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Okay, you know what it is.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I can't get it open.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Come on.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I want this.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Very loud in my ear hole.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay, there we go.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I did it. I got it.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You think I should have done that before I started the stream, instead of during?

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Are you ready for your training?

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Did you see my streams this week where I'm turning in our puppy dogs?

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I already got all the accessories for you.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hmm.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Let's wait a little bit.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Are you ready for your training?

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Woof woof woof.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh dear.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Put a little kibble in here.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Make it go in here.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Make it eat them.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Looky looky.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I got my corporate, got my tea.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
My British fucking tea.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This is the tea that always goes cold, okay?

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It always goes cold.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Can I, am I allowed to talk to you whilst looking my tea?

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hmm, yeah, this is pretend we're doing Lego ASMR.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
She came showing me, look.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Sorry, it's falling out at the bottom, but don't mind me.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You can't see that.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay, I'm a funerfmucky.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm still wearing pants on the stream these days.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I had to put clothes on.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm repping the merch.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:03,140
Look at me, it's two of me actually, so honestly, this next character, she matches my color scheme quite well.

75
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:10,000
Hmm, hmm, hmm, yeah, the training to be a dog to turn you into him.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,300
You have to wait for the tea.

77
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,480
Okay, so this is how much tea we have, so let me begin.

78
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:26,480
Oh, let me be clear, oh my god, yes, we're doing Hobbit, an unexpected journey, okay?

79
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,480
And then, who do we have on the box?

80
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:40,480
We've got Big Gandalf, we've got Big Bilbo, his hair is perfectly nice, lovely, who did that?

81
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,480
Hold on, let me get out of the way, let's admire the box, no one's here for, oh, just spilled tea all over me!

82
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,480
Right, put the fucking lego away and drink the tea first, you fucking twat.

83
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,480
Right, that's it, you need to look at that, literally.

84
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,480
Hmm, nice warm tea, who wants to suck the tea from my leggings?

85
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:05,480
You're more than welcome to, no, no, no, help yourself, Riefling, you mean, take it all, take it all.

86
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
Oh yeah, that smells good.

87
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,480
Me, yeah, you're always sucking up.

88
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,480
I'm doing the lego in a minute, give me a minute, give me a minute, this tea's gonna be frozen, okay?

89
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,480
Let it go, let it go, did you just see my hair?

90
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,480
Oh wait, sorry, I'm ginger and green hair in real life.

91
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Shadow Wizard Money Gang, we destroy VTubers in this house.

92
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,480
I'm not piloting a mech, I promise I'm not piloting a mech.

93
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,480
Mummy, close her rip, better take them off, are they absorbing at least, can you absorb?

94
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:57,480
I can't believe it, my Strony branded merch, well, it's just, it doesn't, uh, oh.

95
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,480
I'm gonna wipe myself down cause you're not sucking fast enough.

96
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,480
Yeah, look, rip, check the nails, stunning, gorgeous.

97
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:18,480
I got the boss lady but she didn't recognise me, obviously I was gonna throw it all out, I was like, give me back my toenail.

98
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,480
But no, she wasn't in the talking mood and I was like, thank god cause I don't talk in general.

99
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:32,480
And my voice is still broken from the Elden Ring stream, you might be able to hear it right now, it's possible, but yeah.

100
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,480
I broke my voice on Elden Ring with you, but that's okay, that's my fault.

101
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,480
So I'm shutting up after this stream.

102
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:49,480
I've got five pre-made shorts that I'm gonna record after stream, I think.

103
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:57,480
And then that's it, I'm not allowed to talk, I'm not allowed to do any calls, management or anything like that.

104
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:08,480
Um, yeah, the, if you want some leaks, there's not really many leaks going on right now.

105
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:14,480
We're kinda at the stage where the leaks are like, you can't leak that yet, but you can leak it once it's leaked.

106
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:22,480
And I'm like, okay, okay, so I'm praying Shibi just starts leaking stuff and then I can leak it too cause Shibi has to do it.

107
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,480
I can't do it, that's not, I'm not allowed to take that away from the girl, okay.

108
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,480
I need, I need Shibi to leak it.

109
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,480
I'm being like, am I in a suspended accident?

110
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Me like, no, I can finally talk about it, thank god.

111
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Speaking of leaks, oh, did, did Zora do Peeler?

112
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,480
Leaking the leak is peaking, is there a reason your pinky isn't perfect?

113
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:56,480
Yeah, yes there is, but that reason I cannot leak it.

114
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:02,480
I wonder, I wonder why my nails are arranged in such a way.

115
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,480
You've already reached your leak budget for this quarter, honestly, I genuinely have.

116
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Hi, Stroni has been going, I'm finishing my cup of tea, look, look how much I drank, I'm such a big girl.

117
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,480
Look, it's getting like, it's 3D, ooh, 3D cup of tea.

118
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,480
And yes, there's a bird on the side that goes, what's doing?

119
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Don't you know about the bird?

120
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Everybody knows the TikTok bird.

121
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
That's a bit of brain rot for you.

122
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,480
3D debut, fucking hell, how much money do you think I have?

123
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,480
3D debut, mm.

124
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,480
I'm a confidently say no, but thank you, I love the enthusiasm.

125
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,480
Colours indicate what she does with a finger.

126
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,480
Oh, you've not heard of this move, yeah, have I not done this move against you?

127
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,480
I call it the prostate piercer.

128
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,480
What the hell is this?

129
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
What would these three come together to do?

130
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
That looks awful.

131
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,480
I look like I'm trying to throw up gang signs but fail in a really bad way.

132
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
I'm like, fail in the dexterity check.

133
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
How do you put 3D together?

134
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Doing the wooshy finger fold.

135
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
So you know that.

136
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
Oh wait, no, what is it? Is it skiddish?

137
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
Like that, skiddish?

138
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Any skiddishers?

139
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Any skiddishers at all.

140
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,480
Okay, let me finish this.

141
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,480
And me did what?

142
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
When?

143
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
No, she didn't.

144
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,480
You're trolling, right?

145
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
I don't know, are you skidding me?

146
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,480
Is it feel, what?

147
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Sorry, hold on, let me read again.

148
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,480
Is it bad if you're slightly more anxious when I'm separated?

149
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
Is it bad though?

150
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,480
I mean, if I can bring you comfort when I'm up but I don't want you feeling bad when I can't be online all the time.

151
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:34,480
Like this week is a very short week but I'm needing it because I'm trying to, I've just got the audio manager in.

152
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,480
I'm going to try and get another manager in so then I am fully just a creative,

153
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,480
I write scripts if they want them, I do stuff if they want them but I'm only on the creative side.

154
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,480
I don't tell them any agents.

155
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,480
This is the girls, okay?

156
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,480
This is me not doing anything for them and breaking it down.

157
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
Separation anxiety is normal.

158
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,480
As long as we have separation anxiety, oh my, I can't be online all the time, I feel bad.

159
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,480
I might have a, I'm trying to think that I might have that unique level.

160
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,480
I could potentially do it today, I know I keep saying I'm going to do it tonight or today

161
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,480
but what happens is I go offline and I've got eight DMs and I'm like, I have to deal with all of this right now.

162
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,480
Right now.

163
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,480
And then I get very tired.

164
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,480
Okay, let me finish this.

165
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,480
Let's see, look at my, look at that progress.

166
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
Look at that 3D debt.

167
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
That's okay.

168
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
We know you need your rest unfortunately.

169
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,480
As I said, if I was a vampire, it'd be over for everyone.

170
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,480
We know you mummy, you probably have things planned for net.

171
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
No!

172
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,480
No!

173
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
No!

174
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
No!

175
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,480
Why would I do that?

176
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,480
Why would I have things planned?

177
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
Where's my ruler?

178
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
Hold on, hold on.

179
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
Whoa, just like the webcam.

180
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
I'm doing my face with you.

181
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
You know I look brash.

182
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,480
Where's my ruler?

183
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,480
Hello?

184
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,480
Where's the open end?

185
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,480
Oh God, wait, I can bring my January.

186
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Oh, hold on.

187
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,480
Hold on, bring in January, come on.

188
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,480
January is watching me build Lego.

189
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
Against their will.

190
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
Ooh, you see that?

191
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
I didn't like it.

192
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,480
You heard that?

193
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
Mate, come on then.

194
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,480
You're forced to watch me build Lego.

195
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Oh, but I don't want to.

196
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,480
Well, I don't want to do a lot of things and I still do.

197
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
I still do, so you have to come along.

198
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,480
Come along.

199
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Come along.

200
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,480
Oh my God, the other racist agency, they whitewash their talents.

201
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
And they're merchandise.

202
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,480
That's it, the other, you're getting cancelled on Twitter right now.

203
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,480
I can't believe it.

204
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,480
I can't believe it the way you've been doing these things.

205
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,480
Sorry, I don't know what the fuck I'm yapping about.

206
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,480
I'm trying to finish this cup of tea.

207
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,480
Oh my God, my hair is on the thing already.

208
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
Get over here.

209
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,480
And then obviously, I don't know, are you kidding me?

210
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,480
I look forward to the Patreon later.

211
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,480
Wait, what happens on Patreon?

212
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,480
Hold on a minute.

213
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,480
Oh, the punk audio role play.

214
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,480
Okay, thank you Dynan for 10 pound meal deal at M&S.

215
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:06,480
I uploaded a Patreon audio and I'm a punk in it and I'm like, hey, you mister,

216
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,480
I don't have a place to stay the night.

217
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
What?

218
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,480
No, I don't want your money.

219
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,480
I want Shellr and I'm a punk.

220
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,480
And in the role play, I have two angel wings.

221
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,480
But in real life, I only have one.

222
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,480
I only have one.

223
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,480
Actually, my angel wings are the funeral for me.

224
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,480
Just in case you haven't seen that.

225
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,480
Let's hold a lot of velour funeral for it.

226
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,480
Let's hold a funeral for it.

227
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,480
Okay, so this is me crying next to the angel wing.

228
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,480
And then, yes, I'm role playing with my gen mates with fucking key chains.

229
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,480
No, this is funny.

230
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
I'm having a funeral.

231
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
Right, mercy.

232
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480
My hair's too big, unfortunately.

233
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,480
I have to go here a little bit.

234
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
Shibi.

235
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,480
Shibi, would you like to say a word because you are also peers?

236
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,480
Ash, you twerk.

237
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,480
I am so saddened at your angel wing being gone.

238
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,480
I'm so sorry it happened so.

239
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,480
And then, A.C. will come and comfort me.

240
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,480
And then, Imi will massage my feet, thank you.

241
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
And then, Azura will play with my hair.

242
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,480
And then, Mercy will give me his kisses.

243
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,480
And then, Shibi will suck me off under the desk.

244
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,480
That's how the girls are going to comfort me.

245
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,480
Right, enough, enough, enough shenanigans.

246
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,480
But, if you ever wanted your own, it would be a market key chain of any of the girls at the beginning.

247
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
You know where it goes.

248
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
The link is in the description.

249
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,480
Yeah, I don't know if you guys are comfortable with this concept,

250
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,480
but I thought, from a doughnut on the top, Donator would get my crusty angel wing.

251
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,480
And before you're like, wait, Strawny, what do you mean crusty?

252
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:09,480
I mean, literally, there's crust embedded in this little thing.

253
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,480
This used to run through my skin and it doesn't.

254
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,480
Yeah, that's how the pierced thing is.

255
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Oh, God, I can't.

256
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,480
What? That was my stomach that made that noise.

257
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
Have you heard that?

258
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,480
There you go.

259
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,480
It did me a good server.

260
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,480
It did good, but I'm not getting re-pierced before anyone asks

261
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,480
because it was so painful and terrifying.

262
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,480
And the healing process was genuinely awful.

263
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,480
Absolutely awful.

264
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,480
Sending a chemical weapon to your top Donator is a vote.

265
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
For real.

266
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,480
Okay, now let's actually get down to that agenda.

267
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
Oh, the manual just fell out.

268
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,480
Emanuel.

269
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
Come on, Stan.

270
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,480
Okay, so we've got buffer.

271
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Bumper, I'm pretty sure.

272
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,480
Hold on.

273
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Hold on.

274
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
I'm a fake Hobbit fan.

275
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,480
Let me just...

276
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,480
Gandalf the Grey, Feldo Baggins, Bolin.

277
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,480
I don't have my glasses on and this is Tiny.

278
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
Hold on a minute.

279
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,480
We've got Dolin, Buffer and Bumper.

280
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,480
Okay.

281
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
Why all the Bs?

282
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,480
I guess I'm missing one.

283
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
Yeah, this is my Lego Hobbit set.

284
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,480
I didn't even think I was gonna get this.

285
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,480
I just looked up the price of it and it was like,

286
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
obviously come on manual.

287
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,480
I've never built Lego in so long.

288
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,480
Oh, they gave you this.

289
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,480
There's like this special magical piece

290
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,480
that's like gonna separate the...

291
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,480
You wear glasses?

292
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Yeah.

293
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,480
This is my glasses when I play Fortnite.

294
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,480
Glasses to the enemies.

295
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,480
Look, they're child's glasses

296
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,480
because adult glasses don't fit my head.

297
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,480
I don't know what's wrong with my head,

298
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,480
but I can only fit child's glasses.

299
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,480
So there you go.

300
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
These are me.

301
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,480
Okay, I'll put my glasses on for the shoot.

302
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,480
Whoa, I can see.

303
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,480
Cute, extra small and cute head.

304
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,480
Literally, I was really embarrassed getting glasses.

305
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,480
I was like,

306
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,480
where's for the women's?

307
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,480
You know, where's for the adults?

308
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,480
And I was like, I can do this one.

309
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
It's kind of adorable.

310
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,480
It needs to be carried around in a pocket.

311
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,480
Like a pocket.

312
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,480
No, you can't say that, right?

313
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,480
I can't wear the glasses

314
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,480
because my brain's trying to adjust.

315
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
I'm still not adjusting my glasses.

316
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,480
Okay, so long story short.

317
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
This cost a lot of money

318
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,480
and thank you to the Anon,

319
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,480
that literally...

320
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
Why is there pieces?

321
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
It's a resale, by the way.

322
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,480
This is like old, old.

323
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,480
But do you want to hear the drama?

324
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,480
The drama?

325
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,480
Okay, you want to know where the drama was?

326
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,480
I got sent a fake Lego set.

327
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,480
Everyone gasped at the same time.

328
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,480
A fake Lego set.

329
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,480
But I got full refund, so don't worry.

330
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,480
Sorry.

331
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,480
So the company I bought from got scammed.

332
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
This is the second box.

333
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,480
Sorry.

334
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
It looks like I've just pulled out the same box.

335
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
No, I've got two.

336
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,480
And they gasped.

337
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,480
So it got delivered and I heard it

338
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
and I was like, this does not sound right.

339
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
And then I don't know if you can see.

340
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,480
This is very clearly opened.

341
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,480
Like I didn't do this like tab business thing.

342
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
And then the set.

343
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,480
I don't want to get it mixed up by accident.

344
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,480
The set is the wrong fucking color.

345
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,480
I'm like, who's Lego is this?

346
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,480
It's like part three of some other set.

347
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
It's all red.

348
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,480
This is not Hobbiton.

349
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,480
I don't know what this is.

350
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,480
And yeah, like this is all black.

351
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,480
I'm like, what or who, why?

352
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,480
Bizarre.

353
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,480
But I've got full refund, so happy days.

354
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,480
They also gave me the Hobbit advertisements

355
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,480
for like all the different Hobbit sets

356
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,480
being my bobbers.

357
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,480
But I don't really care too much

358
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,480
for anything else.

359
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
I was in Bag End and Hobbiton.

360
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
I just want to Hobbiton or Bag End.

361
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,480
I want like a full ass set.

362
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,480
You know how like everyone's like,

363
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,480
oh, you should do the, um, how do you call it?

364
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
Oh, these are extra Lego pieces

365
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,480
in case they go missing.

366
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,480
Oh my gosh, I can push stickers then.

367
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,480
Oh my God, that's so cute.

368
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,480
I can put like wood on the Bag End.

369
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,480
It must be.

370
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,480
We will follow the instructions at once.

371
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,480
Oh, right.

372
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,480
Let me make my VTuber model a little bit smaller,

373
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,480
because I am, I think it's over.

374
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,480
Right.

375
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,480
I've not done Lego.

376
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,480
Oh, they sent an extra piece as well.

377
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
Thank God, because by the way,

378
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
if I had to take pieces apart with these nails,

379
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
it would be over.

380
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
The stream would never end.

381
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,480
It would be the endless stream, honestly.

382
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,480
Right, let's just put these away,

383
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,480
because this one says number one.

384
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,480
Okay, so let's start there.

385
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,480
Let's start in number one together.

386
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,480
We are building sideways.

387
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,480
So we're building...

388
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
Wait, what?

389
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Is this the bag?

390
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,480
Oh, no!

391
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,480
Oh, yeah.

392
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,480
There's two booklets,

393
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
so that's how long this is going to take.

394
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,480
Are we going to finish in one stream?

395
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,480
I'm getting nervous.

396
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,480
I'm getting nervous.

397
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
I'm getting nervous.

398
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,480
Are we going to be able to finish this style?

399
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,480
I'm starting to think this isn't going to be a one-off stream.

400
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,480
Um, right, let's take a piece number one.

401
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,480
Okay, piece number one.

402
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,480
Let's do a speedrun.

403
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,480
I think I would have to literally stop looking at chat

404
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
if I was going to try and do a speedrun.

405
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,480
Right, we've got another orange,

406
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,480
which is actually probably pretty handy.

407
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,480
I can see myself doing the wrong thing.

408
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
I can't put my digital model anywhere else.

409
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
So this is how the track is going to be.

410
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,480
It's just going to have to get lost a little.

411
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,480
Is there an S?

412
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
Whoa!

413
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,480
Wait, the box is called S for that time?

414
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,480
It says it's for 94-year-olds.

415
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,480
14-year-olds, right?

416
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,480
All right, so that means if I have enough brain power,

417
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
I can do those rank work.

418
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
With the yapping.

419
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
Oh, there's another packet inside the packet.

420
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,480
These were put...

421
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,480
That's Bilbo's hair!

422
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,480
They killed my man!

423
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,480
Where's Bilbo?

424
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
Bilbo!

425
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,480
He's dead!

426
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,480
No, we packed it.

427
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,480
Oh, no.

428
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,480
Where's his body?

429
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
Bilbo?

430
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,480
Are you in here?

431
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
Bilbo.

432
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,480
Oh, I see his face.

433
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,480
What the fuck?

434
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,480
Why are we unlocking my characters one part by part?

435
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
A typical nation.

436
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,480
Thank you for the tip.

437
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,480
You can use the orange tool to help you place the stickers more neatly.

438
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,480
Oh, okay.

439
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,480
It means you're not legally allowed to build it

440
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
until after the age of 14.

441
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,480
Surely this isn't going to be hard.

442
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,480
Right, okay, let's get the facts right.

443
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,480
Okay, so I'm going to try and do it so you can see

444
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,480
both the manual and the Lego we're working on.

445
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,480
So I'm going to have to look away from the microphone a little bit for this.

446
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,480
Okay, so here's the instructions.

447
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Here's the pile of shite we're working with.

448
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,480
That's about eight.

449
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:06,480
Step one, take the plank and add a long green strip.

450
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Surely this is how it's meant to be, right?

451
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
Hold on.

452
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,480
I'm going to see if I can eliminate this area slightly there.

453
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,480
I do have not really, um, if you really know,

454
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,480
so you should be perfectly, look,

455
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,480
you should have a very nice thing you can see.

456
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,480
Uh, whoa, that's too much.

457
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
Okay, sorry, that's too much.

458
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,480
Sorry about that.

459
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,480
She's not getting fucking blinded watching this stream.

460
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,480
Uh, the green piece goes next to it, not on it.

461
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,480
Whoa.

462
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,480
What?

463
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
Green.

464
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
That one.

465
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
What, like that?

466
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,480
Are we extending?

467
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,480
And then it gets held together by four wee skinny ones in a row.

468
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,480
I have access to four wee skinny ones in a row.

469
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,480
No, I don't.

470
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,480
I don't see it.

471
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,480
Is it in these?

472
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,480
It's not told me to open.

473
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
Oh, there's a skinny one.

474
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,480
I need those, mate.

475
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,480
It's in here.

476
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,480
I guess you are opening these ones.

477
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
Give me Bilbo.

478
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,480
I got the dirty one.

479
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,480
I'm going to do this with the animals.

480
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,480
Right, okay.

481
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,480
Okay, so before, are we all a great dish on my face?

482
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
She's stumbling on step one.

483
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,480
Don't point it out.

484
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,480
I'm trying.

485
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,480
I don't know how well you can see the instructions, but yeah.

486
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,480
A little skinny piece goes up here.

487
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,480
Okay, extend it and then add this.

488
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
How do we do it on four?

489
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,480
It must be on the floor.

490
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,480
I was going to say you can't do that.

491
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,480
Okay, so four pieces will extend to the plate area.

492
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,480
Okay, we're expanding the map.

493
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:56,480
The next, take the eight dotted green pieces

494
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,480
and walk.

495
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
Add them down.

496
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,480
One, two.

497
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
What the fuck?

498
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,480
No, I should have watched the video.

499
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,480
You know that?

500
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,480
I'm so confused right now.

501
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
I'm not even like...

502
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
I'm not even trolling.

503
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,480
I think I need to use your glasses.

504
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,480
No, it's not that.

505
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,480
I don't know.

506
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
I'm here, right?

507
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,480
I've just done this one.

508
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,480
And then it says take a piece like this, which I have.

509
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,480
It takes multiple pieces.

510
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,480
Wait, hold on.

511
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
Oh, okay.

512
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
I'm supposed to do it this way.

513
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
Sorry, I didn't have my glasses on.

514
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Sorry.

515
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,480
Okay, just put them together.

516
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,480
Sorry, sorry.

517
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
That makes much more sense.

518
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,480
Yeah, they're obviously going to have lines in the diagram

519
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,480
that you can see, but you can't visually see them.

520
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,480
If you're being blinded by a ring light, okay?

521
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,480
Be nice to me.

522
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,480
I'm being blinded by a ring light.

523
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,480
Stop.

524
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Stop.

525
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
Right, okay.

526
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
Step three, completo.

527
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,480
Okay, first page done.

528
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
What's next?

529
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,480
Okay.

530
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,480
Next is take a sand, a ground block.

531
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
You do what was it?

532
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,480
Oh.

533
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,480
Take a block and then do what?

534
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
Just do that.

535
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,480
And then put a big green quadrant on top.

536
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,480
My paternal urge to take care of...

537
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
I'm fucking dumb.

538
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
I'm so sorry.

539
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,480
Right, it says take that one.

540
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,480
Right, we've done that.

541
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:01,480
And this step says one, six green teeth.

542
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
Okay.

543
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
Then extend it to whole...

544
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,480
Yes, okay.

545
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,480
Mm-hmm.

546
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
Okay, step five done.

547
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
Oh my God.

548
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
Okay, I've got it.

549
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,480
I've got it.

550
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,480
Okay, then we're going to step six, which is this green teeth here.

551
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,480
Okay, it's starting to slowly understand my brain is catching up.

552
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,480
Very slowly.

553
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,480
I need a green teeth to hold.

554
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
And where does it...

555
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,480
What does this green teeth go?

556
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
Like that?

557
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
That's all that's left to do?

558
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
No.

559
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,480
Whoa, that's fucked up already.

560
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
Hold on a minute.

561
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
Let me just...

562
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,480
Oh, this one.

563
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,480
I forgot that.

564
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,480
It disappears, okay?

565
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,480
Okay, and then it goes like that.

566
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
And then...

567
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
And then what?

568
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,480
What?

569
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Yeah, this is correct.

570
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Hold on.

571
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,480
It's not over until it's over, you know what I'm saying?

572
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,480
One, two, three, one, two.

573
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
Three.

574
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,480
How many...

575
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,480
Four to three.

576
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,480
But three in the book.

577
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,480
Stranny, you need a three by two.

578
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
What?

579
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
Wait, is that a wheel?

580
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
Oh, it is a three by two!

581
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,480
How did you spot that?

582
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,480
You have such good eyes.

583
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,480
Oh.

584
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,480
Okay.

585
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
Uh...

586
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,480
Then a three by two.

587
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Yeah.

588
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
Two.

589
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Four.

590
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
Four.

591
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,480
And if I do that, then does it do the number thing I want to do?

592
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,480
Let's do...

593
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
Three.

594
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
What?

595
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Hold on.

596
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
Nah, positive tunes.

597
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,480
What's going on here?

598
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,480
Something's no right, and it's probably me.

599
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
Right, what's going on?

600
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
Step one.

601
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,480
Right, step one.

602
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Right, fuck off, not now.

603
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Step one, add the sand block underneath, which we have, it's there.

604
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,480
That...

605
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
Okay, hold on.

606
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,480
Hold on, I need to justify it to you before we continue.

607
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Hold on, positive tunes.

608
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,480
Add one sand block.

609
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,480
I have added the sand block, it's there.

610
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,480
This is this one.

611
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:37,480
Add one, four by two to keep the sand and the grass together.

612
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
Okay.

613
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,480
And then add one fucking circle thing.

614
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,480
So I'll put it there, the weights in the diagram.

615
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:55,480
And then it says one, three by two, all of a sudden, is producing...

616
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
What?

617
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,480
Oh, shit!

618
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
What?

619
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
Oh, this looks great.

620
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,480
Whoa, we did it!

621
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
We did it!

622
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,480
I said, yeah, we did it!

623
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,480
We did it, we did it.

624
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
We're on step seven.

625
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
We did it!

626
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,480
Okay, page two complete.

627
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,480
I think I was trying to insert something where it shouldn't belong.

628
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
What does that mean?

629
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
What do you mean by that?

630
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,480
Okay, next step of this.

631
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
Are you ready?

632
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:38,480
Okay, step eight, take this, add it in here.

633
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,480
Gorgeous.

634
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:52,480
And then take one, two, three, four, five, six by two, which is this, and connect it here.

635
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
Okay.

636
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,480
Fucking hell, it's all blended in.

637
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,480
I hope none of you are colorblind.

638
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Then take...

639
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,480
Where's my glasses?

640
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,480
Actually, I'll give it up and put my glasses back on.

641
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,480
All right, you win.

642
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,480
You win.

643
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
I'm wearing glasses in this room.

644
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,480
You win.

645
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,480
That doesn't help.

646
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,480
Is this room dark?

647
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,480
I'm having a mental...

648
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,480
Yeah, I'm losing it.

649
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,480
Anyway, this is why I wear the collar.

650
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,480
Okay, two, we won.

651
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,480
And then one, two, three, four, five, six, and one, two, three, four, five, six.

652
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,480
Okay, six by two, six by one, two, we know.

653
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,480
It's got it.

654
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,480
Six by two, one, two, three.

655
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,480
Yeah, six by two.

656
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,480
That's that piece there.

657
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,480
Okay.

658
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,480
Then a skinny six by one.

659
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,480
That's that piece there.

660
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,480
And then two wee jobbies inside.

661
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,480
Are the jobbies in here?

662
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
Oh, I see my jobbies.

663
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
Out comes.

664
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Out comes.

665
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,480
I see my jobbies in here.

666
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,480
I've lost them.

667
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,480
Okay, one jobbie.

668
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,480
And then we need one more jobbie.

669
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,480
Oh my God.

670
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,480
Oh, it's Bilbo.

671
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,480
He's coming together.

672
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,480
Hello.

673
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,480
Oh, I dropped them.

674
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,480
Sorry.

675
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
I don't look so worried.

676
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
He's so scared.

677
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,480
He's like, no, they're reading my pantry.

678
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,480
What's up?

679
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,480
Right.

680
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
Unfortunately, it doesn't happen.

681
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,480
You ain't got no legs.

682
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,480
Lieutenant Dan.

683
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
Is this easier?

684
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,480
This is easier for me.

685
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
I'm going to be honest.

686
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
I can kind of bring the microphone

687
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,480
a little bit closer to me like this.

688
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,480
Okay.

689
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,480
I blew his legs off of C4.

690
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,480
Oh, there's his legs.

691
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,480
Oh my God.

692
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,480
I'm speaking of his legs.

693
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,480
Feel it.

694
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
Now he can shy.

695
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,480
I just had a memory.

696
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,480
There's a YouTube video

697
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,480
of Lego people

698
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,480
doing a drunk song,

699
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
but it's to a musical Mozart piece

700
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
or something like that.

701
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
It's like, drink to your family.

702
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
Drink it with your friends.

703
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,480
Beer of friendly liquid made for you.

704
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,480
You're going to drink till you spew.

705
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,480
Okay.

706
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
We have Bilbo.

707
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
Right.

708
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,480
Back to the problem.

709
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,480
Okay.

710
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
I need a skinny Joby, right?

711
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Skinny Joby.

712
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,480
Skinny Joby.

713
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,480
Come on.

714
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,480
Come to mommy.

715
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,480
I probably should have used

716
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,480
my headset for the stream.

717
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Now that I think about it,

718
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,480
instead of the microphone

719
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,480
being a little to the ring,

720
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,480
I shouldn't have a headset on.

721
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,480
That would have sounded like this.

722
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
Right.

723
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,480
We've got the pieces for this bit.

724
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,480
This looks like that.

725
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,480
I'm not going to put it down

726
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,480
until I'm satisfied

727
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,480
with the structure in which

728
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,480
I'm going to put it down.

729
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,480
Not again.

730
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
Not again.

731
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,480
Hold on.

732
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,480
I need to pick up the sheet paper.

733
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,480
I can't see the brown very well.

734
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
What a bizarre.

735
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,480
I don't know how it creates the Lego,

736
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,480
but sometimes it feels like

737
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,480
they don't want you to win.

738
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,480
I do it when they are.

739
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,480
Then I do a skinny pool

740
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,480
and then do a long.

741
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,480
And then I do skinny again.

742
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
Like that.

743
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,480
And then I hammer them all in.

744
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,480
Oh, I missed.

745
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,480
That's okay.

746
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,480
Hold on.

747
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
It's a bit.

748
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
Something's cracking.

749
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,480
I ain't me.

750
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,480
Must be your back.

751
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,480
Oh, Jesus.

752
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Oh, Jesus.

753
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
Whoa.

754
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
Don't do that.

755
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,480
Please go in.

756
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,480
Thank you.

757
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,480
Oh, we're down there.

758
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,480
And then we need three tails

759
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,480
and two green.

760
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,480
So tail, tail.

761
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Oh, don't do it.

762
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,480
Tail.

763
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,480
And then two green.

764
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,480
That's a light gray.

765
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,480
Not black.

766
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,480
So I can't see what it is.

767
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,480
Lego raking ASMR when?

768
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,480
Autistic girlfriend rakes through Lego

769
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,480
while you sleep ASMR when?

770
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Where the fuck is it?

771
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,480
Huh.

772
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Am I going mental?

773
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,480
Hold on a minute.

774
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,480
Hold on a minute.

775
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,480
Oh, let me just slavix squat.

776
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,480
Oh, I found one.

777
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,480
I'm slavix squatting right now.

778
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,480
I don't know if you can tell.

779
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,480
Can you tell?

780
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,480
Those are my thanks.

781
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,480
I'm slavix squatting.

782
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,480
This is the perfect way to find the missing Lego.

783
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,480
Bro, how do you think you should?

784
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,480
Where's the green?

785
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,480
Yeah, I'm down.

786
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,480
If I can't find it.

787
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,480
I need one little green piece to continue.

788
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,480
I'll please tell them I've not lost a piece already.

789
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,480
That would be far too early.

790
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
Okay.

791
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,480
That would be far, far too early.

792
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,480
Where?

793
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,480
I'm gently combing over.

794
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,480
It's like super big.

795
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,480
Trouble.

796
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,480
Trouble.

797
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,480
Trouble.

798
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,480
Trouble.

799
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
Am I going?

800
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,480
I'm pointing with my finger.

801
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,480
I've actually lost a fucking piece already.

802
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
Okay.

803
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,480
Let's just put this down first.

804
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,480
So, in theory.

805
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,480
In theory, yeah.

806
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,480
Oh, you can tell where the big light is.

807
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,480
You're getting blinded in my string.

808
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,480
No, we're gamers out here.

809
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
We can't be gamers.

810
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
Where's the fucking...

811
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Oh, there is.

812
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
Found it.

813
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,480
Okay.

814
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,480
Square has won.

815
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,480
We've all been poking out.

816
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,480
Like that.

817
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,480
I mean, it looks like...

818
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,480
Whoa, don't go that far.

819
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
Don't go that far.

820
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,480
Let me go get it.

821
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,480
Why did...

822
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
Have I done that wrong?

823
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,480
Wait.

824
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,480
Have I done that upside down?

825
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,480
Oh, excuse me.

826
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,480
Sorry.

827
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,480
Don't look at one set.

828
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,480
Don't look.

829
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,480
Don't look.

830
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,480
I'm embarrassed.

831
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,480
Don't...

832
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,480
I was like, no, that's not possible.

833
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,480
That's not how it works.

834
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,480
Just don't look.

835
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,480
I'm embarrassed.

836
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,480
Don't look.

837
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
It was upside down.

838
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
It was upside down.

839
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,480
Okay.

840
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
It was upside down.

841
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,480
I admit it.

842
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
I'm embarrassed.

843
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,480
This is going to take so long.

844
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,480
I bet you'll be like,

845
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,480
what's the average time it takes to build this set?

846
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,480
It'll be like two hours, me five hours later.

847
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,480
I did it.

848
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,480
I did it.

849
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,480
Right.

850
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,480
Third page done.

851
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,480
Yeah.

852
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,480
And a whole other night.

853
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,480
Can we do the cute shit that's repetitive?

854
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,480
What is this?

855
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,480
What?

856
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Hold on.

857
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,480
Let me...

858
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
Hold on tight.

859
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,480
You should have bridges.

860
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,480
That's good for Peach.

861
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
Go.

862
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,480
Okay.

863
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,480
Let's put this aside.

864
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,480
To the side, you go.

865
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,480
Okay.

866
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,480
So take a sand and a long strip of grass.

867
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,480
Which is what you're looking for.

868
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,480
Take a strip.

869
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,480
She's checking it twice.

870
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,480
I'm trying to see if you're nodding or not.

871
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,980
And I'm kidding.

872
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,480
It's not Christmas just yet.

873
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,480
But if we do celebrate Christmas with you...

874
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
Are you with me right now?

875
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,480
Oh no, ironically though.

876
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,480
Sorry, sorry to...

877
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,480
Sorry to go on a fucking round the way back.

878
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,480
It do be kind of feeling like Christmas is a day.

879
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,480
I was talking to a creator I might be so happy with shortly.

880
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,480
And I was kind of just like seeing...

881
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,480
Obviously it was very quick because I was getting ready for a stream at the same time.

882
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,480
I was just saying to her, I was like, I can just finally be myself, you know?

883
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,480
There's no...

884
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,480
There's no nothing.

885
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,480
There's no stress at all.

886
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,480
There's no worry of anything.

887
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,480
Okay, we're kind of...

888
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,480
I think it's clicking slowly in my head.

889
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,480
But I was just like every day is like a...

890
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
Autistic girlfriend builds Lego video...

891
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
Wait, didn't I not just say that?

892
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,480
What are you not here for?

893
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,480
I said I was gonna do a meme rule for you.

894
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,480
Autistic girlfriend's Lego building.

895
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,480
I'm gonna take another small green pack.

896
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
And I'm gonna connect those two pieces together.

897
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,480
And then take another corner piece.

898
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,480
Like this.

899
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,480
And then take a three by two.

900
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,480
Oh my gosh, it's clicking!

901
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,480
I'm just...

902
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
Well, sometimes I'm smart.

903
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
I'm not...

904
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,480
I am having a good time though.

905
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,480
I hope this isn't too boring.

906
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,480
I'm actually really enjoying this.

907
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,480
I didn't expect to enjoy it so much.

908
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,480
But I am.

909
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,480
She's doing it, Kendall.

910
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,480
Look, we're already on the next page.

911
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,480
I think it just needed to...

912
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,480
Because I've not built Lego before.

913
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,480
I see people do it.

914
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
I've seen like this.

915
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,480
I don't know if you remember this viral video where it was this poor gentleman crying.

916
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,480
Someone purposely came in and broke his stuff.

917
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,480
His Lego stuff.

918
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,480
It was truly the most bizarre timeline.

919
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,480
They were like so malicious against that poor man.

920
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,480
And they broke all his sets and everything.

921
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,480
And he was crying.

922
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,480
And he was like, I give up.

923
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,480
I'm not doing this anymore.

924
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,480
Very thankfully.

925
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,480
I think a couple of months later he came back to the Lego hobby.

926
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,480
But yeah, this is your first Lego.

927
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,480
Yeah.

928
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,480
I've never done Lego before.

929
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,480
Wait, is it really common to do Lego?

930
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,480
Um...

931
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,480
I...

932
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,480
I...

933
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,480
I don't do...

934
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,480
I didn't have the opportunity.

935
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,480
I got forced like...

936
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,480
Did I tell you that time I chewed on marbles as a kid?

937
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,480
Because I was that dumb?

938
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,480
I don't know if I told that story yet.

939
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,480
Um...

940
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,480
Once upon a time...

941
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,480
I got gifted marbles.

942
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,480
And they were rainbow colored.

943
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,480
Um...

944
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:58,480
And I was convinced they were like those chewy hard candy sweets.

945
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,480
So I was like for five minutes I was like chewing on marbles.

946
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,480
I thought I was like those like hard sweets

947
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,480
that have that outside in there like gum in the middle.

948
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,480
So I was like chewing and chewing and chewing and chewing.

949
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,480
I just didn't give up.

950
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,480
I was kept going for like five minutes and munching on them.

951
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,480
So...

952
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,480
Yeah, and um...

953
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,480
So I...

954
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,480
Anyway, that's the true story.

955
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,480
Um...

956
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,480
And I have to live with that knowing I did that at my big old age of like...

957
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,480
I think I was nine...

958
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,480
I think I was ten years old actually.

959
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,480
Does Mummy have British teeth?

960
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,480
Sadly I spawned in with them.

961
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,480
Um...

962
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,480
But I'm really lucky.

963
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,480
I don't have...

964
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,480
You got it wrong.

965
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,480
Are you squidding me right now?

966
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,480
I don't know.

967
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,480
Are you squidding me right now?

968
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,480
Excuse me, Mum.

969
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,480
We've had a few concerns raised by your fellow Hobbits in regards to your construction site.

970
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,480
Could we see your OSHA certification?

971
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,480
No, I don't have one anonymous.

972
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,480
Thank you for the tip.

973
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,480
I don't have one.

974
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,480
Oh wait.

975
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,480
I never saw...

976
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,480
Sorry.

977
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,480
I never heard the other gifted.

978
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,480
Do you want to know my setup right now?

979
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,480
This is how I...

980
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,480
If I know you have given me a super chat or something.

981
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,480
It plays out of this headphone and I have to listen out for that.

982
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,480
Are you squidding me right now?

983
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,480
I'm sorry if I missed any donations.

984
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,480
I'm shy.

985
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,480
Hold on.

986
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,480
Thank you basically for the tip as well.

987
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,480
Autistic girlfriend builds a Lego figure and puts it in her...

988
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,480
cursed Lego.

989
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,480
Curse.

990
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,480
This headset is too small for you.

991
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,480
I wish this thing could go smaller.

992
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,480
I used these blanks.

993
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,480
I used to use turtle beaches obviously.

994
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,480
Am I going crazy?

995
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,480
A wee bit.

996
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,480
I mean that looks great.

997
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,480
Take the long green one.

998
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,480
Take the long brown one.

999
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,480
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1000
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,480
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1001
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,480
Well.

1002
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,480
Brown.

1003
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,480
Green.

1004
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,480
Yeah.

1005
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,480
I don't know why my brain is telling me it's brown.

1006
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,480
That's my body.

1007
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,480
Where did that come from?

1008
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,480
I'm connecting...

1009
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,480
like this.

1010
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,480
Oh my gosh.

1011
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,480
It's going to be this.

1012
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,480
Sorry my hair is fricking on the mat.

1013
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,480
It's going to be this big.

1014
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,480
It's a little bigger than I thought it was.

1015
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,480
I thought it was going to be small.

1016
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,480
Oh my God.

1017
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,480
Look at that.

1018
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,480
It took way too long to do just that.

1019
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,480
Okay.

1020
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,480
We need long brown.

1021
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,480
One long brown.

1022
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,480
Two long brown.

1023
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,480
And then put them.

1024
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,480
Oh my God.

1025
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,480
This must be back in the house.

1026
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,480
Oh my God.

1027
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,480
We're doing it.

1028
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,480
Are you proud of me replaying?

1029
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,480
You need to build on a hard surface?

1030
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,480
I mean...

1031
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,480
Just holding together quite well.

1032
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,480
Oh, there it is.

1033
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,480
Yeah, you like that.

1034
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,480
Look at this.

1035
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,480
This is your bull sack stitching.

1036
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,480
And this is my finger going up it.

1037
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,480
Making that noise.

1038
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,480
Okay.

1039
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,480
I need two big blocks of sand.

1040
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,480
And two corner pieces of sand.

1041
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,480
That I have here.

1042
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,480
And I am going to not do it upside down like last time.

1043
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,480
I...

1044
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,480
I am a surgeon.

1045
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,480
Oh, you're my surgeon.

1046
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,480
I'm a surgeon fish.

1047
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,480
Push.

1048
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,480
My little fingies are pushing down so hard.

1049
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,480
Bro, she buffed up my fingers.

1050
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,480
I don't even see it.

1051
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,480
So at the end of doing your nails,

1052
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,480
they like buffer fingers,

1053
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,480
but I have really awkwardly shaped like nails,

1054
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,480
beds or whatever.

1055
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,480
She fucked my hood up.

1056
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,480
Most lady was not having it.

1057
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,480
Some other nice lady asked me

1058
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,480
if I was getting beatled just nails.

1059
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,480
And I was like,

1060
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,480
honestly, it looks like it.

1061
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,480
And I was like,

1062
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,480
no, it's for an anime girl.

1063
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,480
And I was like,

1064
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,480
hey, I'm a small talk.

1065
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,480
We're doing here.

1066
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,480
I was like,

1067
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,480
oh, you're my surgeon.

1068
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,480
She was like,

1069
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,480
oh, you're my surgeon.

1070
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,480
And I was like,

1071
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,480
oh, don't you get...

1072
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,480
Wait, turn it upside down.

1073
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,480
Oh my...

1074
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,480
We're doing surgery.

1075
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,480
I am a surgeon.

1076
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,480
We're holding it together with butterflies.

1077
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,480
A butterfly tape.

1078
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,480
Okay.

1079
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,480
We are.

1080
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,480
Like this.

1081
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,480
Oh my gosh.

1082
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,480
I'm so smart.

1083
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,480
Sometimes.

1084
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,480
Oh.

1085
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,480
Oh, give it what we feel.

1086
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,480
What do you feel?

1087
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,480
What do you feel?

1088
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,480
Diamond for M&As less.

1089
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,480
I never heard this.

1090
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,480
Brian, Brian,

1091
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,480
you need to announce yourself louder.

1092
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,480
Do you understand me, Brian?

1093
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,480
Brian, don't give me that look.

1094
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,480
Whoa.

1095
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,480
That's a bit of a rough surgery.

1096
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,480
But I think the patient's going to be okay.

1097
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,480
I think he's going to be okay.

1098
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,480
I'm not strong enough

1099
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,480
to squeeze the leg pieces together.

1100
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,480
Maybe turn the instructions.

1101
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,480
Just an idea.

1102
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,480
Make it easier on your side.

1103
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,480
Don't take it in a bad way.

1104
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,480
Wait, my don't...

1105
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,480
It's better if you see it.

1106
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,480
Or am I going mental?

1107
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,480
It's better for you to see it.

1108
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,480
But my bad.

1109
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,480
Wait, am I being a dumb dumb?

1110
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,480
If I'm looking at them up,

1111
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,480
the instructions upside down,

1112
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,480
it's still correct for me

1113
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,480
if I have this bit upside down.

1114
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,480
Or is that not how the instructions are?

1115
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,480
I think universal.

1116
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,480
Weird.

1117
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,480
I picked you.

1118
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,480
No, it's okay.

1119
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,480
You're the one who does it.

1120
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,480
Thank you, Diamond.

1121
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,480
I did it.

1122
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,480
Need a harder surface

1123
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,480
so your chest will suffice.

1124
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,480
You know what?

1125
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,480
Take that.

1126
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,480
I love my nails.

1127
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,480
I feel so girly

1128
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,480
when I get my nails done

1129
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,480
because I'm not very girly at all.

1130
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,480
What am I...

1131
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,480
speaking of being a look

1132
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,480
at the instructions a bit closer?

1133
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,480
That doesn't really make any sense.

1134
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,480
It just says kind of

1135
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,480
what put one here.

1136
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,480
I mean, yeah,

1137
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,480
that's what it says.

1138
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,480
Slip back.

1139
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,480
No, I'm up here.

1140
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,480
Oh, no.

1141
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,480
Is it here?

1142
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,480
Okay.

1143
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,480
Okay, that's fitting really well.

1144
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,480
Now we're turning it

1145
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,480
and we're adding two,

1146
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,480
four hills and two long ones.

1147
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,480
Can I get four hills and two?

1148
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,480
No, two hills and...

1149
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,480
Oh, what?

1150
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,480
Four hills and two long ones.

1151
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,480
Sorry.

1152
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,480
I mean, we're almost done

1153
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,480
the first piece.

1154
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,480
If we're going by the bag,

1155
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,480
I've almost finished the bag,

1156
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,480
the first bag,

1157
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,480
and there's four.

1158
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,480
So we're already one fourth

1159
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,480
of the way there.

1160
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,480
Right?

1161
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,480
That's how it works.

1162
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,480
Right?

1163
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,480
Yeah.

1164
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,480
Yeah.

1165
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,480
I think it is.

1166
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,480
So these graph versions

1167
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,480
and then two of them.

1168
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,480
Okay.

1169
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,480
And then we put the graph verges.

1170
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,480
That's the building

1171
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,480
that's bag end.

1172
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,480
So...

1173
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,480
Now hold on a minute.

1174
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,480
This is just to be a little gap.

1175
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,480
No.

1176
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,480
I almost fell

1177
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,480
for the instructions mistake.

1178
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,480
It says go one up.

1179
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,480
Oh, my God.

1180
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,480
I almost got pranked by Lego.

1181
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,480
But anyway, speaking of Lego,

1182
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,480
if you guys could come out with a bag end,

1183
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,480
like a proper bag end set,

1184
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,480
I'll buy it.

1185
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,480
I don't care how much it costs.

1186
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,480
Please cater to the nerds like me

1187
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,480
who just like the fantasy garden

1188
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,480
and just don't, you know,

1189
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,480
want to get a little getaway,

1190
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,480
want to do a little thing.

1191
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,480
Mum is so smart.

1192
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,480
Good job.

1193
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,480
I actually do feel praised right now.

1194
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,480
You know what?

1195
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,480
I'm doing a good job.

1196
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,480
Are you having fun?

1197
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,480
I am, mama.

1198
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,480
I'm having fun.

1199
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,480
I am.

1200
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,480
Okay.

1201
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,480
Okay.

1202
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,480
We've got graph verges.

1203
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,480
Oh, my God.

1204
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,480
We're doing so good.

1205
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,480
And then we need two long wee bits

1206
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,480
and wee wee bits.

1207
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,480
Okay.

1208
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,480
Two long bits and two wee bits.

1209
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,480
They're still small though.

1210
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,480
Okay.

1211
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,480
I got them.

1212
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,480
Okay.

1213
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,480
Then the two long bits go here.

1214
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,480
On the outer pieces of the

1215
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,480
the board.

1216
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,480
This is,

1217
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,480
this is not chess board.

1218
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,480
Actually, I need to,

1219
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,480
that's like the third time I reset

1220
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,480
I got chess board.

1221
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,480
And I've not planned it this week.

1222
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,480
I did.

1223
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,480
And I made an account.

1224
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,480
I'm telling you,

1225
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,480
you're still yet to do it.

1226
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,480
Who's going to be able to play

1227
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,480
with me and Sheevie

1228
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,480
on

1229
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,480
Left or Dead?

1230
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,480
I'll message Sheepsters to see how

1231
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,480
a pat on the butt for how well I'm doing.

1232
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,480
See no more.

1233
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,480
See no more.

1234
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,480
Yes.

1235
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,480
Me and Sheevie are playing

1236
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,480
Left or Dead 2 together.

1237
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,480
I'm so happy.

1238
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,480
She like messaged me

1239
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,480
and she was like,

1240
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,480
oh, can I do it with you?

1241
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,480
And I'm like,

1242
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,480
I didn't even occur to me

1243
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,480
that I could grab another girl

1244
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,480
and bring her with me

1245
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,480
to get stream sniped with me

1246
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,480
so she can enjoy in the fun.

1247
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,480
So I've been thinking

1248
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,480
away at myself

1249
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,480
if there's a possibility

1250
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,480
of more stream sniping

1251
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,480
with my gen mates.

1252
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:26,480
But it has to be

1253
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,480
on games that they are playing.

1254
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,480
I'm not making anyone play games.

1255
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,480
They're like,

1256
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,480
oh, we're getting a bit advanced.

1257
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,480
Hold on a minute.

1258
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,480
I need one wee gray block.

1259
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,480
Got it.

1260
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,480
I need two long,

1261
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,480
wait, what?

1262
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,480
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1263
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,480
Oh, that's that one.

1264
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:49,480
I need a wee four piece of sand.

1265
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,480
And then I need two long ones.

1266
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,480
And just to check.

1267
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,480
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1268
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,480
Or should I be counting the other one?

1269
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,480
And I have plans on my

1270
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,480
didn't save the other reasons

1271
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,480
I have to play.

1272
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,480
Well, I was gonna,

1273
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,480
I don't know how long Sheepsters

1274
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,480
is gonna keep it up for.

1275
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,480
I'm not gonna like force her

1276
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,480
to keep playing things.

1277
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,480
Think of the weaklings.

1278
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,480
No.

1279
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,480
But I can continue afterwards.

1280
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,480
And you guys can show me the game.

1281
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,480
Because I think we'll do

1282
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,480
zombie mode to give as much people

1283
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,480
a chance as possible.

1284
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,480
But we are gonna...

1285
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,480
I can't talk and think at the same time.

1286
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,480
Let's start with the...

1287
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,480
Let's start with the outside key.

1288
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,480
Okay.

1289
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,480
A true gentleman.

1290
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,480
I can dance.

1291
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,480
And what do you attach to?

1292
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,480
There's nothing to you.

1293
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,480
You don't attach to anything.

1294
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,480
You're just there.

1295
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,480
I assume my piece is gonna come along.

1296
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,480
Um...

1297
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,480
Hmm!

1298
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,480
Ah!

1299
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,480
Wait.

1300
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,480
Hold on.

1301
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,480
Hold on.

1302
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,480
Hold on.

1303
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,480
This is what happens when I get off of here.

1304
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,480
Get out of here.

1305
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,480
What?

1306
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,480
Ah!

1307
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,480
It was supposed to go back.

1308
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,480
Ah!

1309
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,480
No!

1310
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,480
No!

1311
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,480
Don't start this.

1312
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,480
No!

1313
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,480
I'm not repeating anything.

1314
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,480
Hold on.

1315
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,480
Hold on.

1316
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,480
What?

1317
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,480
A campaign map can last an hour?

1318
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,480
I was just gonna boot you after I go.

1319
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,480
Like, after we finish our map, you'd get booted over.

1320
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,480
Hold on.

1321
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,480
Yeah.

1322
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,480
One back.

1323
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,480
One back.

1324
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,480
Agreed.

1325
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,480
Agreed.

1326
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,480
I'm glad we're on the same page.

1327
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,480
Right.

1328
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,480
Let's try again.

1329
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,480
Take the long piece.

1330
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,480
Right.

1331
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,480
Then take this boy.

1332
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,480
See that boy?

1333
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,480
See who he is.

1334
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,480
He is that Lego block.

1335
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,480
I swear.

1336
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,480
He's that Lego block.

1337
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,480
And then...

1338
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,480
Right.

1339
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,480
That.

1340
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,480
Correct.

1341
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,480
Correct him.

1342
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,480
Correct him and do.

1343
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,480
Right.

1344
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,480
And then we need corner sandstone.

1345
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,480
Two by one sand.

1346
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,480
Two little brown things.

1347
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,480
And then one long sand.

1348
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,480
And then what?

1349
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,480
Okay, the long one goes over here.

1350
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,480
Good.

1351
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,480
This is quite the set.

1352
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,480
I wonder how much it retailed for when it actually came out.

1353
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,480
Because I go, come on.

1354
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,480
Because it was scalpers.

1355
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,480
You told me that word yesterday.

1356
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,480
It was scalpers.

1357
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,480
Will someone please blame the scalpers?

1358
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,480
They make all the prices so big.

1359
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,480
And that's what they are.

1360
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,480
They inflate it.

1361
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,480
Yep.

1362
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,480
They're into inflation, clean.

1363
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,480
I'm not here at kink shing.

1364
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,480
But if you inflate my Lego pieces,

1365
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,480
I'm...

1366
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,480
I'm...

1367
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,480
Right, go in.

1368
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,480
Go in.

1369
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,480
Who wouldn't go in?

1370
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,480
That looks correct, right?

1371
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,480
Oh my god.

1372
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,480
Okay, nice page.

1373
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,480
This is getting mighty complex through my brain.

1374
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,480
I don't know about you,

1375
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,480
but this is getting mighty complex.

1376
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,480
Thank you, Stache Power.

1377
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,480
For the tip as well.

1378
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:43,480
Yes, I will boot you out after every lobby.

1379
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:47,480
I think you're going to have to add me

1380
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:50,480
on my Strony Snipes account in order to get in.

1381
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,480
Because Shibi doesn't have a stream chat account.

1382
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,480
I want to keep her account safe.

1383
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,480
It's possible.

1384
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,480
Right, I need one singular sand block.

1385
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,480
You got any emeralds for me?

1386
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,480
Okay, one singular sand block.

1387
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,480
Two sandy slopes.

1388
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,480
Sand to sandy.

1389
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,480
Four by one sand.

1390
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,480
Gimli's hair is somehow in the Lego pieces

1391
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,480
when this is being unopened.

1392
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,480
Gimli's my cat, by the way.

1393
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,480
For content.

1394
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,480
I have a cat called Gimli.

1395
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,480
You named your cat after a Lego Lord of the...

1396
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,480
Lego Lord of the Rings?

1397
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,480
Yeah, fuck it.

1398
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:38,480
I named her specifically after a Lego Lord of the Rings.

1399
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,480
Okay, I need two brown slopes as well,

1400
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,480
but it looks longer.

1401
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,480
And then, a knee.

1402
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,480
One, two, three.

1403
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,480
I need to sit down still.

1404
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,480
I'll gather them and then I'll apply them.

1405
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,480
My fingers are getting sore.

1406
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,480
They're like, this feels sore.

1407
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,480
Gives it better replant.

1408
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,480
Gives my baby there.

1409
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,480
Are we going to focus?

1410
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,480
Focus on it.

1411
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,480
Ew, you hear transness in this scene.

1412
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,480
Ew, don't look at the veins of my fingers, okay?

1413
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,480
Don't be rude.

1414
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,480
Don't stare at the veins in this scene.

1415
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,480
Okay, thank you for kissing up there.

1416
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,480
I didn't realize making Lego was sore on the hand.

1417
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,480
Right, enough yapping.

1418
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,480
Where or what am I doing?

1419
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,480
Okay, take the long...

1420
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,480
No, don't take the long two.

1421
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,480
Hold on.

1422
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,480
My brain is putting together what it's asking.

1423
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:49,480
Right, it's asking for the singular knob to go here.

1424
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,480
No, it's asking for the stick.

1425
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,480
Stick.

1426
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,480
Stick.

1427
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,480
I'm not putting anything in.

1428
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,480
I promise.

1429
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,480
I'm just like, putting it there.

1430
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,480
Oh, go and just sit there.

1431
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,480
Right, you know what?

1432
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,480
I've had enough out of you.

1433
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,480
Wait, are these long?

1434
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,480
Hold on.

1435
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,480
Processing.

1436
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:26,480
Processing.

1437
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,480
Oh, it's upside down.

1438
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,480
Wait.

1439
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,480
Who said do this?

1440
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,480
Dream.

1441
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,480
Honestly, I shouldn't freaking go out like that at the beginning.

1442
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:42,480
What's going on?

1443
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,480
Hold on.

1444
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,480
Can I turn it around for a moment?

1445
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,480
Sorry.

1446
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,480
Give me a moment, please.

1447
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,480
Wait, can Anna just...

1448
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,480
Give me a second.

1449
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,480
I'm just going to try and test something for a moment.

1450
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,480
Is this going to be like...

1451
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:14,480
Hi, is this going to be like 10 times even?

1452
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,480
I think I might have just resolved.

1453
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,480
Oh, and the microphone's really easy to talk into from here.

1454
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,480
Oh, hmm.

1455
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,480
Should I have done this from the start?

1456
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,480
What?

1457
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,480
Me making things more difficult?

1458
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,480
Oh, my tracking.

1459
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,480
I forgot my tracking.

1460
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,480
Okay.

1461
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,480
All right, little iPhone, it's your time to shine.

1462
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,480
Look, this is how you see me.

1463
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,480
Look, it's me.

1464
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,480
Hi.

1465
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,480
This is how...

1466
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,480
Oh, you can see it scanning from my face.

1467
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,480
Okay.

1468
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,480
Well, anyway, all hail are overlords.

1469
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,480
The only problem is it's really hard to read you.

1470
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,480
Okay.

1471
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:02,480
Let's go back to what I need to do.

1472
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:07,480
Which is...

1473
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,480
Oh, wow.

1474
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,480
I can see it a lot easier too.

1475
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,480
Who would have thought?

1476
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,480
What do you mean if you make this simple for yourself?

1477
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,480
It gets easier.

1478
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,480
Oh, no.

1479
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,480
Okay.

1480
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,480
So that does go here.

1481
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,480
And then a brown one goes here.

1482
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,480
Oh, and the Lego part of the hair.

1483
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,480
That went like boom.

1484
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,480
Okay.

1485
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,480
And then the four by one.

1486
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,480
Oh, my gosh, this is going to be so much faster.

1487
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,480
Bro, literally name a better duo.

1488
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,480
Me making things like 10 times harder than it has to be

1489
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:48,480
and like solving it like an hourly or something.

1490
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,480
Don't you love women that are kind of...

1491
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,480
Okay.

1492
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,480
So that's that strip here, like from here.

1493
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,480
I'm just trying to make sure that you can see it in here.

1494
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,480
Could I just flip the camera upside down on OBS and spun the book around?

1495
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,480
I'm sorry.

1496
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:10,480
I couldn't figure that out.

1497
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,480
Okay, long.

1498
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,480
Did long.

1499
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:16,480
And then sandstone.

1500
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,480
Uh-huh.

1501
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:20,480
Then a four piece.

1502
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:25,480
Sandstone.

1503
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:29,480
And then a long piece.

1504
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,480
Oh.

1505
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,480
What?

1506
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,480
We did it!

1507
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,480
Step 21, completo.

1508
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,480
Okay, that definitely...

1509
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,480
Uh...

1510
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:44,480
I do like making life hard for myself from there.

1511
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,480
I'm very overqualified for it.

1512
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,480
Right, okay, one brown piece.

1513
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,480
Two little browns.

1514
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,480
One classic Lego block.

1515
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,480
Look, we've got this big Lego set.

1516
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,480
Oh.

1517
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:02,480
We can now whisper into your ears how to build it.

1518
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,480
Literally.

1519
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,480
No, but actually though.

1520
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,480
Can you see it?

1521
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,480
Like if I was like in your lap, I'm just like,

1522
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,480
Hi!

1523
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,480
I'm doing my thing.

1524
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,480
Okay, so I'm just smurfing.

1525
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,480
Literally, I'm real...

1526
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,480
I'm trying hard and right.

1527
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,480
Let me bring up the pieces so you can see how much is left over.

1528
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:24,480
Like this set is about to be finished.

1529
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,480
Look at these pieces.

1530
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,480
They're so little.

1531
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,480
Okay.

1532
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,480
You're looking exceptionally pretty today.

1533
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,480
Oh, thank you.

1534
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,480
Thank you anonymous for the tip.

1535
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,480
I'm glad I could sit on your lap.

1536
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,480
Um...

1537
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,480
And thank you, Jacazi.

1538
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,480
And the Booty Lord.

1539
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,480
What's going on?

1540
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,480
Hold on.

1541
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,480
Why are you all getting the same brain cells?

1542
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,480
Sorry.

1543
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,480
Going on a date with Momita Legoland Island?

1544
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,480
Wait, what?

1545
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:54,480
Going on a date with Momita Legoland Island?

1546
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,480
Is Legoland a place?

1547
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,480
I bet you didn't expect to hold some super chat.

1548
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,480
Really, I'm sure.

1549
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,480
Thank you, the Booty Lord.

1550
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,480
Is Legoland a real place?

1551
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,480
I did this...

1552
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:10,480
Is it like a video game?

1553
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,480
Legoland has a lot of different things.

1554
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,480
There's really one point.

1555
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,480
Okay, so six by six here.

1556
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,480
And then you go there.

1557
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,480
And you go...

1558
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,480
Yeah.

1559
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,480
And there's a little knob of butter.

1560
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,480
How did he...

1561
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,480
How did he know, like, putting these blocks together

1562
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:34,480
would make something that looks like hoverton?

1563
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,480
People must get to that.

1564
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,480
What do you say?

1565
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,480
That is in Disneyland?

1566
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,480
Legoland is in Disneyland.

1567
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,480
Oh, it's real?

1568
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:46,480
Ah, can we go to Legoland?

1569
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,480
Can we go to Legoland?

1570
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:53,480
Is there anything from Lord of the Rings in Legoland?

1571
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:54,480
Or is it a lie?

1572
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,480
And it's just propaganda in the bi-legoland.

1573
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:58,480
Pretend that we care.

1574
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,480
But we don't care.

1575
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,480
Oh, thank God.

1576
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,480
Okay.

1577
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,480
More sand blocks.

1578
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,480
Jeez, wrap it up.

1579
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,480
Okay.

1580
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,480
Okay, okay.

1581
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,480
Two uber long sand bars.

1582
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,480
Two uber long.

1583
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,480
Two medium.

1584
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,480
One wee knob of block.

1585
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,480
And a two knob of block.

1586
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,480
Okay, there we go.

1587
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,480
Boom, now what?

1588
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,480
All of them?

1589
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,480
Okay, so the two long ones go on the outside.

1590
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,480
I can do that.

1591
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:40,480
I can do that.

1592
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:44,480
And then those two knob of butter here.

1593
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,480
Oh, who goes there?

1594
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:51,480
I'm like a violent child, claiming.

1595
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,480
I'm on my high risk one.

1596
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,480
I'm late, but hold on.

1597
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,480
No, you're not late.

1598
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,480
You're not too late.

1599
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,480
I really should put ambience on,

1600
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:02,480
just so it's not like me rambling into a room.

1601
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,480
You're getting no ambience.

1602
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,480
Sorry.

1603
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,480
I'll just sing the Hobbit soundtrack, right?

1604
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,480
Ready?

1605
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:10,480
We'll do the black gate.

1606
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:15,480
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1607
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,480
Okay, we did that part.

1608
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,480
And then we shall do...

1609
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,480
Oh, you never saw that.

1610
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:27,480
You didn't see that, okay?

1611
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,480
You didn't see it.

1612
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,480
It's all secure.

1613
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,480
This isn't going to fall apart.

1614
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,480
It's not going to be like a mean world,

1615
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,480
like finish it and then it just go apart, okay?

1616
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,480
You didn't see it.

1617
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,480
You didn't see it.

1618
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,480
Come on.

1619
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,480
Wait, what?

1620
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,480
Oh, no.

1621
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:42,480
Okay.

1622
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:46,480
Well, this better be one, two, three, four, five, six.

1623
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,480
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1624
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,480
Okay.

1625
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:54,480
That needs to recalibrate my visual.

1626
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,480
I mean, I literally can't see it at all,

1627
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,480
so I'm going to just trust that it's doing its thing.

1628
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,480
I need to connect these two,

1629
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,480
but once they are connected,

1630
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,480
I see all the memes about how you'll never unconnect them again.

1631
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,480
Ready?

1632
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,480
Oh.

1633
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,480
For eternity.

1634
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,480
For eternity.

1635
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,480
Oh, it says turn it around.

1636
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,480
Okay.

1637
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,480
I think we're putting a chest down.

1638
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,480
Okay.

1639
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,480
We'll put a little chest in the middle.

1640
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,480
Oh, my God.

1641
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,480
Wait, is that a window?

1642
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,480
We get to make a window.

1643
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,480
Oh, my God.

1644
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,480
My nails are in the way of like solidifying it down

1645
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,480
because they're like, they're long in front.

1646
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,480
Like I would hit that.

1647
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,480
I got my nails a little longer.

1648
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:40,480
Okay.

1649
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,480
We did that.

1650
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,480
Oh, let's fucking blitz through this.

1651
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,480
Come on, lads.

1652
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,480
Come on.

1653
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,480
We're doing it in one stream.

1654
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:48,480
I'm not having this.

1655
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:49,480
I'm not having this.

1656
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,480
What the fuck is that?

1657
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,480
Can you even see that?

1658
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,480
Bring it down a bit.

1659
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:55,480
Break down there, nail diva.

1660
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:57,480
Can you separate pieces?

1661
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,480
They gave me a tool to do it.

1662
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:02,480
I don't actually know how to do it.

1663
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,480
Oh, yeah.

1664
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:04,480
Oh, listen to that.

1665
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:07,480
Here's the mark.

1666
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:08,480
Um, right.

1667
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:12,480
I've got me two knobs above.

1668
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,480
And I need some sort of weird brick.

1669
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,480
Oh.

1670
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:20,480
Did I get to make the fireplace?

1671
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:21,480
Oh, my gosh.

1672
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,480
Did I get to make the fireplace?

1673
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,480
Stop.

1674
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,480
What am I making inside of it?

1675
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:26,480
Oh, no.

1676
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:27,480
My nails.

1677
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,480
My nail.

1678
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:31,480
Can I even get that in the corner?

1679
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:33,480
Oh, my God.

1680
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:36,480
Legos said they hate me.

1681
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,480
Oh, no.

1682
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:44,480
Again, Lay, can I use your paw?

1683
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,480
I need to, like, use the tool to get it in the corner.

1684
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,480
You just stay right there.

1685
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:50,480
I can't do it.

1686
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,480
Oh, my God.

1687
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:52,480
I really hope there's no...

1688
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,480
Stop.

1689
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:57,480
I really hope there's not any pieces that are hard like that.

1690
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:01,480
It's, like, right in the corner of it.

1691
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:05,480
Now, I'll use the tool like a hammer.

1692
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:12,480
Okay, we need two long brown sticks and one black, whatever this is.

1693
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,480
I guess it's the fireplace.

1694
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:14,480
I would...

1695
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:18,480
If I was a, uh, a losing person, I would totally...

1696
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,480
Oops.

1697
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,480
And it went away.

1698
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,480
I thought this is really...

1699
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:29,480
Who said get nails for this screen, honestly?

1700
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,480
I'm a real carpenter.

1701
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,480
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

1702
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:36,480
I'm going to build a house and...

1703
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,480
A shelf?

1704
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,480
Oh, no.

1705
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,480
No.

1706
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,480
Oh, that's wrong.

1707
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,480
Get out of here.

1708
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,480
You're not supposed to be there.

1709
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,480
I'm a Skyrim guard.

1710
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:50,480
You're not supposed to be here.

1711
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,480
I...

1712
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,480
By order of the hour, I'll stop right there.

1713
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,480
I...

1714
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:56,480
You have been...

1715
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,480
Okay, I guess I'll let you go then.

1716
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,480
Okay, back, back, back, back.

1717
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:02,480
Knock, knock, knock.

1718
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,480
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

1719
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,480
Boom, boom, boom.

1720
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,480
Oh, come on, please.

1721
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:08,480
I'm begging.

1722
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:09,480
Oh, that actually...

1723
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,480
Okay, I accepted it.

1724
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,480
It was accepted.

1725
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:16,480
It was accepted.

1726
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,480
And now what?

1727
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,480
My window ledge is breaking.

1728
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:24,480
I'm being too violent with my current property.

1729
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,480
My property.

1730
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,480
Okay.

1731
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:30,480
Someone named Johnny said to get nails.

1732
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,480
Look, the nails are cute.

1733
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,480
Okay, they represent...

1734
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,480
I'm doing tons of hand cam streams this week and I was like,

1735
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:36,480
you know what?

1736
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,480
It is a fireplace.

1737
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,480
Oh my gosh, that's so cute.

1738
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,480
Oh, I went away.

1739
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,480
It is a fireplace.

1740
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:49,480
Look, these are like little gems.

1741
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:51,480
And then what we do?

1742
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:54,480
A black one.

1743
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,480
Put a little bit of butter.

1744
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,480
And then the other piece of the fireplace.

1745
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,480
Oh, I'm dropping it.

1746
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,480
And the other piece of the fireplace.

1747
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:03,480
Okay, for the next one.

1748
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:04,480
Are you kidding me right now?

1749
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,480
Come here.

1750
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:06,480
Come here.

1751
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,480
Come here.

1752
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:08,480
Come here.

1753
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,480
Come here.

1754
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,480
Come here.

1755
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,480
Come here.

1756
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,480
Come here.

1757
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,480
Come here.

1758
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,480
Come here.

1759
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:16,480
Come here.

1760
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,480
Come here.

1761
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:18,480
Come here.

1762
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,480
Come here.

1763
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,480
Come here.

1764
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,480
Come here.

1765
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,480
Come here.

1766
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:24,480
Come here.

1767
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,480
Come here.

1768
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:26,480
Come here.

1769
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,480
Come here.

1770
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,480
Come here.

1771
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,480
Come here.

1772
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,480
Come here.

1773
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:32,480
Come here.

1774
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:33,480
Come here.

1775
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:34,480
Come here.

1776
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,480
Come here.

1777
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,480
Come here.

1778
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,480
Come here.

1779
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,480
Come here.

1780
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,480
Come here.

1781
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,480
Come here.

1782
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,480
Are you squiddling me right now?

1783
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,480
I think that's funny.

1784
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,480
Oh, no.

1785
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,480
Oh, thank you, baby lord.

1786
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,480
I'm glad I can bring back some more memories.

1787
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,480
Have I done this wrong?

1788
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,480
Oh, you dumba.

1789
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,480
My mum used to always be like,

1790
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,480
I'm not doing the person who's strong,

1791
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,480
because you've been bad.

1792
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,480
And then she would always be like, yes.

1793
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,480
She's a bit strong and you've been bad.

1794
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,480
And I'm like, uh...

1795
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,480
Are you squiddling me right now?

1796
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,480
No, no, no, please.

1797
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,480
I'm reaching 25k.

1798
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,480
I'm so proud of you, cologne underscore love.

1799
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,480
Oh, thank you.

1800
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,480
I've got the 25k.

1801
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,480
Oh, I need to order Rebecca's cosplay.

1802
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,480
Soon.

1803
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,480
Okay, right, you go in the fire.

1804
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,480
No, go in it.

1805
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,480
Please stay in.

1806
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,480
No, don't take it out.

1807
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,480
Don't take it out. Leave it in, leave it in.

1808
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,480
I don't want it to be taken out yet.

1809
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,480
And then we add

1810
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,480
to the shelf that is

1811
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,480
accumulating on the side.

1812
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,480
I don't know what it is.

1813
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,480
It's terrible.

1814
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,480
Thank you, Nero.

1815
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,480
Okay, the shelf is on.

1816
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,480
The fire is

1817
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,480
falling off.

1818
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,480
Please just stay inside there.

1819
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,480
It's like, no...

1820
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,480
Wait, isn't it?

1821
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,480
Oh, wait, no, it is.

1822
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,480
It touches to the floor.

1823
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,480
Okay, so this is correct.

1824
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,480
This mirror right here is correct.

1825
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,480
Okay, let me just...

1826
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,480
Oh, let me just...

1827
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,480
Okay, it's secure.

1828
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,480
Oh, my legs are getting sore

1829
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,480
because I'm like perching on them.

1830
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,480
Your mind of a...

1831
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,480
Your mind of a good costume.

1832
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,480
Which of the Rebecca?

1833
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,480
Rebecca from Cyber

1834
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,480
Edge Runners

1835
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,480
or Edging Runners

1836
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,480
Sorry, I didn't watch that.

1837
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,480
For my 30k,

1838
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,480
I was going to say that.

1839
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,480
25k, Tango.

1840
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,480
30k, Rebecca is more...

1841
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,480
35k, maybe the

1842
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,480
10,000 kisses?

1843
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,480
I don't know, maybe 50k.

1844
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,480
I don't know.

1845
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,480
I don't know.

1846
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,480
I was going to do that

1847
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,480
fruit stream. Fruit ASMR where I

1848
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,480
break it with my legs.

1849
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,480
But I need one... No, not that one.

1850
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,480
I need one long

1851
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,480
two. Yeah. And then two

1852
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,480
and a third got to finish the fire plate off.

1853
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,480
Okay. I can do that.

1854
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,480
I can finish the fire plate off.

1855
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,480
Can you see that? I just need to make sure you can

1856
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,480
can't see. If you can see it a little bit,

1857
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,480
my guilty is done.

1858
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,480
Truly, it has nothing else to

1859
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,480
accomplish it. We finish the fire plate off.

1860
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,480
And then...

1861
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,480
we will...

1862
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,480
we will finish the...

1863
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,480
still.

1864
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,480
And then...

1865
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,480
I think we're okay.

1866
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,480
I think we're okay.

1867
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,480
Did anyone

1868
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,480
see anything come flying off it?

1869
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,480
That's what I get for being a violent beast

1870
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,480
on the stream.

1871
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,480
That made my heart drop.

1872
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,480
I have worked too hard on this

1873
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,480
to break

1874
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,480
because of me being like some

1875
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,480
ungebunga

1876
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,480
caveman coming in and destroying it.

1877
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,480
Secure the shell.

1878
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,480
Secure the shell.

1879
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,480
It's popped somewhere.

1880
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,480
I don't know what made it pop though.

1881
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,480
I might just leave it, okay?

1882
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,480
If everyone doesn't acknowledge

1883
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,480
that it happened, it's gonna be

1884
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,480
fame.

1885
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,480
I just realized you can't even see it.

1886
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,480
Sorry.

1887
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,480
Oh my gosh!

1888
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,480
It has a safety...

1889
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,480
The fire poker has a safety thing.

1890
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,480
Oh, what is it called?

1891
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,480
The fire guard. That's it.

1892
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,480
It's literally a guard to fire for any sparks

1893
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,480
because if your wood has a lot of oxygen

1894
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,480
in it, then it will

1895
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,480
like go peep peep peep peep peep peep.

1896
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,480
And you see? Where is the other green one?

1897
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,480
I have one green one.

1898
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,480
Oh, there's only one green one.

1899
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,480
Oh my gosh!

1900
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,480
That's actually adorable.

1901
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,480
Sorry. I want to live in my Lego

1902
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,480
Hobbit tent. That is so cute!

1903
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,480
Look at the fire!

1904
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,480
We can have soup and stuff!

1905
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,480
I'll pretend I know

1906
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,480
how to make bread in a pot.

1907
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,480
I know you can make bread in a pot. I don't know how

1908
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,480
but I know you can do it.

1909
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,480
Look, I've seen someone do it before so obviously

1910
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,480
it's real and true, okay? It's real and true.

1911
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,480
Bread.

1912
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,480
We need to

1913
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,480
put sandstone on top of the fireplace

1914
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,480
to complete it.

1915
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,480
Oh my gosh!

1916
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,480
It's so cute!

1917
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,480
And then we need a fort.

1918
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,480
I don't know. Oh, you didn't see that?

1919
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,480
I literally went, oh my god!

1920
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,480
It's so cute!

1921
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,480
And like squished.

1922
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,480
That is almost wrong.

1923
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,480
Right.

1924
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,480
I need a

1925
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,480
three piece.

1926
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,480
Do I have a brown three piece?

1927
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,480
Hello, I was like one brown

1928
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,480
three piece. I don't know.

1929
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,480
I don't seem to have this

1930
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,480
available.

1931
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,480
Where is the piece I need?

1932
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,480
Oh my god, I've actually lost it.

1933
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,480
No, I don't want it.

1934
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,480
Am I sitting on it?

1935
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,480
It says

1936
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,480
one, two, three.

1937
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,480
Hmm.

1938
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,480
Hmm.

1939
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,480
Hmm.

1940
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,480
Ah.

1941
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,480
Ah.

1942
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,480
Where is it?

1943
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,480
Is it in my book?

1944
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,480
No, it's in my book.

1945
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,480
A three piece brown.

1946
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,480
I don't see a three piece.

1947
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,480
Three piece brown.

1948
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,480
I don't see four. Are you sure that's three?

1949
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,480
It is.

1950
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,480
Hello.

1951
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,480
Is it an important thing?

1952
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,480
Check this out.

1953
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,480
Hmm.

1954
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,480
Hello.

1955
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,480
Has that actually lost it?

1956
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,480
I don't think so.

1957
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,480
Ripped green things.

1958
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,480
Oh, you're right. Sorry. Sorry.

1959
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,480
I don't want to do it.

1960
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,480
Is it possible to say it's missing a piece?

1961
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,480
Does that happen often?

1962
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,480
She knows.

1963
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,480
Yeah, I'm reading chat.

1964
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,480
I know I'm trying to multitask and do two things at once.

1965
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,480
But I am reading.

1966
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,480
I don't know where this random.

1967
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,480
Are you squinting me right now?

1968
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,480
I haven't lost any pieces.

1969
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,480
Whoa.

1970
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,480
Is that kind of an extra card?

1971
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,480
Yeah.

1972
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,480
Thank you, Jean.

1973
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,480
I don't know if I would do more.

1974
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,480
Green pieces back home.

1975
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,480
Yes, it is.

1976
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,480
But where's the brown thing?

1977
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,480
I was like, one brown thing?

1978
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,480
Where is it?

1979
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,480
I don't think it's here.

1980
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,480
Genuinely, I've not lost any piece yet.

1981
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,480
What did I do if they never put it in the freaking thing?

1982
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,480
Literally.

1983
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,480
Is it asking for a brown thing?

1984
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,480
Can I continue without it?

1985
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,480
Right, we're going to have to brute-freaken-

1986
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,480
Don't know if it will help,

1987
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,480
but maybe you can use the scammed setbox

1988
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,480
as a solid base to build on.

1989
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,480
Oh, I'm not sure.

1990
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,480
I think I'll get very confused if I open up.

1991
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,480
Right, I'm going to see if I can build without it.

1992
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,480
I know that sounds really silly,

1993
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,480
but...

1994
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,480
I'm making...

1995
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,480
Fuck.

1996
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,480
It would essentially be hovering

1997
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,480
if I were to

1998
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,480
continue for...

1999
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,480
Thank you, Sophie for that.

2000
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,480
Lift up your entire Lego set.

2001
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,480
It's not in the bag.

2002
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,480
I don't think it came.

2003
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,480
I've literally not lost any piece.

2004
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,480
And this is like a...

2005
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,480
thing that I'm...

2006
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,480
Oh, I'm going to fart.

2007
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,480
I'm so angry.

2008
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,480
Nothing's on the floor.

2009
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,480
Those are the other pieces.

2010
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,480
There's nothing room in the box.

2011
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,480
And there's nothing.

2012
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:10,480
Right here.

2013
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,480
I'm looking

2014
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,480
for a brown

2015
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,480
three piece,

2016
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,480
and it's genuinely not here.

2017
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,480
Like if I separate

2018
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,480
the green and the brown,

2019
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,480
it's not

2020
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,480
actually here.

2021
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,480
I'm not looking on it.

2022
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,480
And this is the box.

2023
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,480
Wait, am I...? No.

2024
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,480
Don't be silly.

2025
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,480
Stop it. I'm giving myself hope.

2026
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,480
Don't be silly.

2027
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,480
Go for a walk,

2028
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,480
and if you feel

2029
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,480
pieces on your feet...

2030
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,480
For the next bag,

2031
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,480
put all pieces in a bowl

2032
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,480
so that you don't lose them.

2033
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,480
I think we might have to...

2034
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,480
Oh, sorry. Hold on.

2035
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,480
I'm just stretching.

2036
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,480
That feels nice to stand up.

2037
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,480
Thank you, Master.

2038
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,480
Are you squidding me right now?

2039
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,480
It might be underneath the stuff we already built.

2040
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,480
It might be underneath the stuff we already built.

2041
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,480
Normally, there's nothing.

2042
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,480
Okay, I'm going to continue.

2043
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,480
We must persevere.

2044
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,480
We can't be...

2045
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,480
That was Sauron's doing.

2046
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,480
Clearly.

2047
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,480
Sauron's absolutely shagging us right now.

2048
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,480
He's...

2049
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,480
Whoa, that just appeared.

2050
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,480
This is all Sauron's doing.

2051
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,480
This is all Sauron's work.

2052
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,480
He's manipulating us.

2053
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,480
He's manipulating us.

2054
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,480
Okay, can you see that?

2055
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,480
I think so.

2056
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,480
Right, we're going to build the fireplace

2057
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,480
without the...

2058
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,480
The lesson here is I buy too many Legos.

2059
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,480
Also,

2060
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,480
current favorite sets are Optimus Prime

2061
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,480
and Bumblebee.

2062
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,480
Hope they do a Decepticon next.

2063
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,480
Have you done a Decepticon Bumblebee?

2064
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,480
I don't know Bumblebee how to sing with you.

2065
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,480
Thank you, James, for the tip again.

2066
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,480
What are you, a Lego nerd?

2067
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:22,480
A Lego nerd?

2068
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,480
I too identify with a Lego nerd.

2069
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,480
I too identify with a Lego nerd.

2070
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,480
Okay, so we don't have

2071
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,480
this little three piece that the shelf

2072
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,480
is about to sit on.

2073
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,480
However, we can attach the underneath

2074
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,480
of the shelf to hide the fact

2075
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,480
that we don't have that piece.

2076
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,480
So I think

2077
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,480
in terms of any piece that could

2078
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,480
have gone missing...

2079
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,480
Are you squidding me right now?

2080
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,480
We're doing alright.

2081
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,480
What?

2082
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,480
That's not how it works.

2083
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,480
That's not how it works.

2084
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,480
If this story is like, this is a story of good and evil.

2085
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,480
You don't go, yes,

2086
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,480
this is the evil person has a point.

2087
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,480
No.

2088
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,480
Stop it, Bumblebee.

2089
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,480
Nice nails, thank you.

2090
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,480
I can't wait for you to see

2091
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,480
why they're like this.

2092
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,480
Right.

2093
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,480
A little bit of the shelf is now off.

2094
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,480
Okay, tricky.

2095
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,480
But we'll do it.

2096
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,480
Don't worry.

2097
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,480
So the shelf goes...

2098
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,480
not like that.

2099
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,480
It does go like that.

2100
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,480
So in theory,

2101
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,480
if the shelf was correct,

2102
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,480
the piece would go like this.

2103
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,480
This is

2104
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,480
not gonna work the way I would like it to,

2105
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,480
but that's okay.

2106
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,480
Because that is the way. He overcomes

2107
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,480
the annoying stuff.

2108
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,480
I said

2109
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,480
you overcome

2110
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,480
the annoying stuff there.

2111
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,480
So now we have a levitain shelf.

2112
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,480
Bumble, fix that shelf right now.

2113
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,480
Okay, that's fine.

2114
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,480
I accept my fate.

2115
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,480
The reason why I said that,

2116
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,480
I'm like 99% sure

2117
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,480
that song, Jewel of the Fate,

2118
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,480
is that.

2119
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,480
Thank you. I'll be here a week.

2120
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,480
I'm sorry.

2121
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,480
I haven't got a brain right now.

2122
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,480
Okay, we're just extending the shelf

2123
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,480
further in this corner.

2124
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,480
Sorry, I'm doing a really bad job of making sure

2125
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,480
you can see what I'm doing.

2126
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,480
These streams are like really,

2127
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,480
really hot.

2128
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,480
It's just so difficult.

2129
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,480
I don't want to make it

2130
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,480
easier for you.

2131
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,480
Don't just wish you,

2132
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,480
don't just do it, do it.

2133
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,480
I need to support this now.

2134
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,480
We'll put a new thing on.

2135
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,480
The knob of butter.

2136
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,480
It's stuck in my head now.

2137
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,480
So I hope you enjoy that Star Wars

2138
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,480
and your fantasy.

2139
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,480
Right, and then do the shelf again.

2140
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,480
Right, I can do the shelf again and have that.

2141
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,480
This side is supported,

2142
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,480
so I don't need to do like two.

2143
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,480
Ah, I can't put pressure on it.

2144
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,480
Whereas this side, I literally have to

2145
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,480
finger to make sure

2146
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,480
it's supported.

2147
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,480
There, we have

2148
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,480
a beautiful

2149
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,480
shelf.

2150
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,480
I mean, it's not that obvious.

2151
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,480
Hold on. It's really not

2152
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,480
that obvious that the bottom piece is on there.

2153
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,480
Oh my

2154
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,480
girl, I love Hobbit 2.

2155
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,480
I love Hobbit 2.

2156
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,480
We should fuck

2157
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,480
unprotected. Sorry.

2158
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,480
That's my insight though.

2159
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,480
Don't listen to me.

2160
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:54,480
I'm doing something I'm doing right now.

2161
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,480
I'm having a good time.

2162
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,480
Don't listen to a thing that comes

2163
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,480
out of my mouth.

2164
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,480
We need grass verges.

2165
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,480
Will someone please think of the grass verges?

2166
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,480
No.

2167
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,480
You're in my head.

2168
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,480
You've done it.

2169
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,480
No.

2170
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,480
No more

2171
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,480
missing pieces.

2172
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,480
Soon, mommy, just a couple of days

2173
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,480
I enjoy when you have no fellow

2174
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,480
agree, but seeing all those

2175
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,480
pieces not cut to properly that

2176
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,480
11.

2177
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,480
We won't miss it.

2178
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,480
Are you squiddling me right now?

2179
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,480
In my white balance.

2180
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,480
Maybe your Lego piece fell in or under your clothes.

2181
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,480
Maybe ditch them for a bit

2182
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,480
and shake them so it falls out.

2183
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,480
No other or bad intentions

2184
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,480
off course.

2185
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,480
Honestly, real and

2186
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,480
wait, maybe it could be like this.

2187
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,480
And before it is up Leslie, that would be hilarious.

2188
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,480
I'm just like, hocus pocus and it appears.

2189
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,480
I honestly

2190
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,480
wouldn't put it behind me that it's like

2191
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,480
somehow attached itself on my butt when I

2192
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,480
slam down on front.

2193
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,480
I'm going to check my pocket.

2194
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,480
Right, okay, turn it around.

2195
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,480
You're now going to add the grass to

2196
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,480
hop up it in.

2197
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,480
Outside the window, there's a big

2198
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,480
old piece right here.

2199
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,480
Then at this

2200
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,480
corner is a big old piece right here.

2201
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,480
Right here.

2202
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,480
And then there's a wee piece right here.

2203
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,480
There you go.

2204
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,480
Right to that end.

2205
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,480
And put that down there.

2206
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,480
And then put that one there.

2207
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,480
I'm going to have to hammer this in because

2208
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,480
because it's against like a brick wall,

2209
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,480
literally a Lego brick wall, it hurts too much

2210
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,480
to put my wee fingernails to work.

2211
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,480
So I'm

2212
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,480
going to go

2213
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,480
home

2214
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,480
to the other day.

2215
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,480
Did I say thank you?

2216
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,480
No, thank you.

2217
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,480
No.

2218
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,480
No.

2219
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,480
Thank you.

2220
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,480
I'm going to take it out of here.

2221
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,480
Right.

2222
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,480
We've not even finished part one of this.

2223
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,480
How long am I in?

2224
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,480
I'm an hour 30, are you joking?

2225
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,480
Surely it gets

2226
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,480
easier than this, right?

2227
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,480
Surely.

2228
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,480
Surely this isn't going to

2229
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,480
accidentally be a several string, right?

2230
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,480
I thought this was going to be quick.

2231
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,480
I didn't realize how big it was.

2232
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,480
That's the size of my hand.

2233
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,480
Okay, so that's the grass marriage done.

2234
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,480
And then

2235
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,480
let's move it a little bit to the side.

2236
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,480
We need

2237
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,480
one long

2238
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:00,480
two long, two slopes.

2239
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,480
Two slopes.

2240
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,480
Okay, I'm getting pranked.

2241
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,480
Okay.

2242
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,480
That's now another brown missing piece.

2243
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,480
That kind of

2244
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,480
kind of

2245
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,480
missing piece.

2246
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,480
Wait.

2247
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,480
That's like major pieces

2248
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,480
missing.

2249
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:36,480
Oh, Don.

2250
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,480
I'm laughing.

2251
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,480
That's more

2252
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,480
pieces like tall for the missing.

2253
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,480
These are

2254
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:48,480
two long ones.

2255
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,480
It's asking for a wee one.

2256
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,480
But I don't have a wee one.

2257
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:54,480
The only wee one

2258
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,480
they're under the window.

2259
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:58,480
They're under the window.

2260
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,480
Maybe they're in another bag.

2261
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,480
This is set one though.

2262
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:04,480
Like I assume it's going to tell me

2263
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,480
to, yeah, open up.

2264
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,480
Wow.

2265
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,480
Okay.

2266
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:16,480
It's asking me

2267
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,480
to set up the window.

2268
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,480
Which I can.

2269
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:24,480
Yeah, these are wrong. Look.

2270
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,480
Okay. I know this looks silly.

2271
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,480
It's asking for two wee pieces

2272
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,480
and it's giving me two brown pieces

2273
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,480
that aren't wee. These are massive.

2274
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,480
These aren't for the window.

2275
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,480
And it's not asking for these two pieces

2276
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,480
anywhere else. The practice

2277
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,480
wrong.

2278
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,480
Is that Legos? It must be Legos fault

2279
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,480
the practice wrong.

2280
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,480
I can't even complete the second window.

2281
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,480
You know,

2282
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,480
like one of the major structure points.

2283
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,480
I'm not being

2284
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:58,480
funny, Legos. You're going to fucking charge that

2285
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,480
much. You're going to fucking pack

2286
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,480
that shit correctly. Is that

2287
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:04,480
for real?

2288
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,480
How are

2289
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,480
like it's asking for

2290
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,480
I don't know what to do.

2291
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,480
I can't complete the window.

2292
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,480
I mean, I can do this.

2293
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,480
I need to

2294
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:34,480
I need one of the main structures

2295
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,480
that are doing something on the side.

2296
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,480
I can't complete the

2297
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,480
window.

2298
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,480
I'm just going to fucking kill myself.

2299
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:00,480
No, maybe there's

2300
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,480
another multiple bad member. No.

2301
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,480
This is how this

2302
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,480
comes.

2303
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,480
One.

2304
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,480
And then

2305
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,480
we're about to do the front of

2306
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,480
Bag Ends, which is two.

2307
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:20,480
One point on.

2308
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,480
Some pieces look the same.

2309
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,480
So you may have used wrong once when

2310
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,480
building. Check to see if there are any

2311
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,480
that aren't supposed to be there on the

2312
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,480
bill.

2313
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,480
I don't think I can do

2314
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:34,480
so myself.

2315
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,480
You know when you want

2316
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,480
something to go right?

2317
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,480
That fucking goes wrong.

2318
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,480
I'm going to do it.

2319
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,480
I'm going to do a pepper.

2320
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,480
Shoot up a fucking

2321
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,480
Walmart.

2322
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,480
What?

2323
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,480
That's really going to bother me.

2324
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,480
That's really going to bother me.

2325
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,480
Why would you do that to me?

2326
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,480
Why would you fucking the most autistic

2327
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,480
person?

2328
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,480
Right, okay.

2329
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:34,480
Forget the window.

2330
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:38,480
Forget the windy. Forget the

2331
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,480
windy.

2332
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,480
Oh, just ripped the page.

2333
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,480
Oh my god, that's...

2334
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,480
Streamer gets so angry, destroys her

2335
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,480
property live on stream.

2336
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,480
I just ripped that.

2337
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,480
Can you see that?

2338
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,480
Oh my god.

2339
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:56,480
Streamer so angry, breaks her own

2340
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:58,480
property. I can't believe it.

2341
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,480
Oh my god, what a violent beast.

2342
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,480
What a violent fucking beast.

2343
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,480
I was like, I missed this tip.

2344
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,480
Hold on once again.

2345
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,480
Stash power. Some people won't be

2346
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,480
saying you may have used the wrong ones

2347
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:14,480
when building. Check to see if there aren't

2348
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,480
any that aren't...

2349
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,480
No, the window one's correct.

2350
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:20,480
Who? Oh, that's Matt.

2351
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,480
What are you doing?

2352
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,480
Thank you Stash Power and the MNNC

2353
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,480
officers.

2354
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,480
What a good ad campaign

2355
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,480
if I saw one of them.

2356
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,480
Streamer anymore.

2357
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,480
Where's the...

2358
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,480
Right, okay. Letters

2359
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,480
analize what we've done so far.

2360
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:46,480
We're going back

2361
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,480
to the fucking

2362
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,480
bastard

2363
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,480
book to look for these

2364
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,480
these.

2365
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,480
Okay.

2366
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:58,480
Okay.

2367
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,480
This fucking bastard.

2368
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,480
Oh, so I'm not trying to wait any longer.

2369
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,480
If I find out that

2370
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,480
I've done something wrong, at least

2371
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:10,480
that's human error.

2372
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,480
Oh.

2373
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,480
Hold on a minute.

2374
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,480
Now, hold on.

2375
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,480
Don't laugh.

2376
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:32,480
Don't laugh.

2377
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,480
Stop it.

2378
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,480
Stop laughing at me.

2379
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:40,480
Stop it.

2380
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,480
No.

2381
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:44,480
I can see it taking.

2382
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,480
Give me that back to the bastard.

2383
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:50,480
Give me these fucking

2384
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:52,480
fanies back.

2385
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,480
Oh.

2386
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,480
Give me them.

2387
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,480
Give me them.

2388
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:02,480
He's mine.

2389
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,480
What does this tool even

2390
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:06,480
accomplish?

2391
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,480
How do you get it out?

2392
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,480
Give me my fucking

2393
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:20,480
pieces.

2394
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,480
Give me my pieces.

2395
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,480
No, I'm going to break it.

2396
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,480
Break the whole board.

2397
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:36,480
Are you squidding me right now?

2398
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,480
Are you squidding me right now?

2399
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,480
I see them. It's those ones.

2400
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:42,480
Thank you.

2401
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:44,480
I'm crying.

2402
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:46,480
I'm crying.

2403
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:48,480
I'm crying.

2404
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,480
I can't eat.

2405
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,480
What do you do?

2406
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:54,480
What were you made for?

2407
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:00,480
Is this not what your purpose is?

2408
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,480
What is your purpose?

2409
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:04,480
To unscoop Lego.

2410
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:06,480
Oh my god.

2411
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,480
Unscoop the Lego.

2412
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,480
Oh my god.

2413
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,480
I don't...

2414
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,480
How do I take it out?

2415
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,480
Sorry. What is your purpose?

2416
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,480
Do you like bring it with me?

2417
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,480
Do I like attach you like this?

2418
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:26,480
No.

2419
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,480
Fuck off.

2420
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,480
Give me the Lego pieces.

2421
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,480
I can't progress.

2422
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:36,480
I can't grab it.

2423
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:38,480
They're clearly not what it's intended for.

2424
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,480
Even though it may visually replace it.

2425
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:42,480
I can't make it visually replace it.

2426
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:44,480
What is that?

2427
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,480
I'm gonna end up breaking the pull down.

2428
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:48,480
It doesn't hold it in.

2429
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,480
Are you squidding me right now?

2430
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:52,480
Right. You know what?

2431
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,480
You were using it right on the side.

2432
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,480
Just need the right angle.

2433
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,480
Brian is having a stroke.

2434
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:13,480
One.

2435
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,480
Okay.

2436
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:30,480
Put it back together again.

2437
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:32,480
What's this trick?

2438
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,480
It's a leg.

2439
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,480
A leg.

2440
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,480
Sorry.

2441
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:44,480
I just sounded like the transformer sound there.

2442
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,480
Right.

2443
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,480
Where's that piece?

2444
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:50,480
There.

2445
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,480
Okay. No more.

2446
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,480
No more.

2447
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,480
Then put the leg on it.

2448
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:58,480
Okay.

2449
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00,480
Uh-huh.

2450
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,480
Oh my god. I'm happy again.

2451
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,480
I'm not upset anymore.

2452
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:06,480
I'm not mad at the world.

2453
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:08,480
Be safe.

2454
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,480
You have broken the curse.

2455
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,480
I am not happy.

2456
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:14,480
So what's that?

2457
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,480
Put one there.

2458
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,480
Put one there.

2459
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,480
Uh-huh.

2460
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:24,480
And then stand the platform.

2461
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,480
Okay.

2462
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:36,480
Okay.

2463
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:38,480
Because you are my witness.

2464
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,480
As you are my witness.

2465
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:46,480
You are my witness.

2466
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,480
Witness man.

2467
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,480
That's the movie.

2468
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,480
It's called Mad Max.

2469
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,480
Max is so mad.

2470
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:58,480
He mad it all the way up and down.

2471
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:00,480
Right.

2472
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:02,480
We need two greens.

2473
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,480
We're going straight back into it.

2474
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:06,480
I promise I'm not mad.

2475
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:08,480
Mommy's not going to hurt you.

2476
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:10,480
Okay.

2477
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:12,480
I'm not going to hurt you.

2478
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,480
I promise.

2479
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,480
Okay.

2480
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:18,480
So we need two slopes.

2481
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:20,480
We need four mini slopes.

2482
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:22,480
We need like tiny little guys.

2483
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,480
We do.

2484
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,480
We do.

2485
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,480
Uh-huh.

2486
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:30,480
And then one big slope.

2487
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:32,480
Yeah. And then what are we doing?

2488
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:34,480
Put one next to the window.

2489
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:36,480
Put one there.

2490
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:38,480
Put three.

2491
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:40,480
One.

2492
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:42,480
No.

2493
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,480
Oh god.

2494
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,480
Get the tool out.

2495
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:48,480
Right.

2496
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:50,480
One there.

2497
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,480
One facing outwards at the

2498
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:54,480
door.

2499
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:56,480
Open the door.

2500
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,480
There's going to be a door.

2501
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:00,480
Close but no cigar.

2502
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:02,480
More like a cigarette.

2503
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,480
But don't say a British cigarette

2504
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:06,480
or you'll be bad.

2505
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:10,480
I don't even love cultural difference.

2506
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:14,480
Mommy's in the other room so

2507
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,480
thank you.

2508
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,480
The cost is

2509
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:20,480
$65.

2510
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:22,480
And a tip for you.

2511
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:26,480
Which really wasn't much of a tip actually.

2512
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:28,480
To the tip more.

2513
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,480
If I didn't

2514
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,480
because I was moving

2515
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:34,480
out of it.

2516
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:36,480
I think I'm going to have to wait.

2517
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:38,480
I think I'm going to have to wash my hands.

2518
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:40,480
I don't want to get sick.

2519
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:42,480
I don't want to get sick.

2520
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:44,480
I get so worried about getting sick.

2521
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:46,480
I don't want to.

2522
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,480
Okay.

2523
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:54,480
Hold on.

2524
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,480
Hold on.

2525
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,480
Hold on.

2526
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,480
Okay.

2527
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,480
I just skipped the.

2528
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:06,480
No.

2529
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,480
Don't start falling apart.

2530
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:10,480
I will cry.

2531
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,480
Don't do this to me now.

2532
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:14,480
I'm too emotionally vulnerable.

2533
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:16,480
After what just happened.

2534
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:18,480
After those.

2535
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:20,480
Okay.

2536
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,480
Grass.

2537
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:24,480
It goes next to the tall one.

2538
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:26,480
Okay.

2539
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:28,480
Oh, you're next.

2540
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:30,480
Thank you for showing up.

2541
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:32,480
You're actually next.

2542
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,480
You're my next time.

2543
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:36,480
I cry.

2544
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,480
All right.

2545
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,480
Bye.

2546
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:42,480
I'm at the end of that time.

2547
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:44,480
Sorry.

2548
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,480
I'm losing it a little bit.

2549
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:50,480
I didn't think this was going to take as long as it did.

2550
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,480
I'm going to be honest.

2551
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,480
I'm recording short.

2552
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:56,480
An ed and a collab.

2553
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:58,480
If I could do that.

2554
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:04,480
Okay.

2555
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:06,480
And then we're jumping to this stage here.

2556
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,480
I'm not going to have to come back here.

2557
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:14,480
Can I go get a cola?

01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,480
Are you winning?

2559
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:18,480
I'm getting my ass beat by little pieces of plastic.

2560
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,480
Microplastic.

2561
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,480
Microplastic.

2562
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:24,480
More like fucking macro plastic.

2563
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,480

2564
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:28,480

01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:04,480
My god, what a girthy can.

2573
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:06,480
Let's see.

2574
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:08,480
That was my hand wrapped around that can.

2575
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:10,480
Had an injury.

2576
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:12,480
Anyway.

2577
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,480
Let me get back in position.

2578
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:18,480
Okay, done the grass verges.

2579
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:20,480
Sorry, the schizophrenia is coming down now.

2580
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,480
I'm not as angry.

2581
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:24,480
Mommy's up.

2582
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:26,480
Okay.

2583
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,480
Two long ones and a skinny long one.

2584
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,480
Two long ones at the side of the window.

2585
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:38,480
To the wall.

2586
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:40,480
To the sweat drop of my bowl.

2587
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:42,480
Of sweet sweet molester.

2588
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:44,480
Of sweet sweet got down.

2589
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:46,480
Sweet sweet got down.

2590
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,480
Sorry, I'm trying not to make this like

2591
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:58,480
the longest fucking Lego building stream

2592
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:00,480
on a man right.

2593
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,480
Move it that way.

2594
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:04,480
And what would moving it this way do?

2595
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:06,480
Give me access to this window.

2596
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:08,480
And it's asking for a platform.

2597
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:10,480
Oh my god.

2598
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:12,480
Do platform it right now.

2599
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:14,480
What does it do?

2600
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:16,480
What does it do?

2601
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:18,480
Just platform it right now.

2602
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,480
Okay, so we have like a window.

2603
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:22,480
Are you squinting right now?

2604
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:24,480
I did a little backflip.

2605
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,480
Mama, I have seen too much corn concerning canons

2606
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,480
and human orifices.

2607
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,480
Thank you, Dan.

2608
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:32,480
Sorry, this is a man.

2609
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:34,480
I'm a man.

2610
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:36,480
Mommy, I've seen too much corn concerning canons

2611
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,480
and human orifices.

2612
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:40,480
I always wanted to fit a can up there.

2613
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:44,480
So...

2614
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:46,480
So does it.

2615
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:48,480
Step two.

2616
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:50,480
Okay.

2617
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:00,480
We did one stage of four.

2618
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:04,480
That was incredibly hard.

2619
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,480
So we have left over pieces

2620
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,480
of this randomly.

2621
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:10,480
So yeah, I guess

2622
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:12,480
what, can you mess with Lego

2623
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:14,480
and be like, hey, you actually didn't give me this piece

2624
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:16,480
and they'll be like, sure, we'll ship it out.

2625
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:18,480
Even if it was like a set that was snake ages ago.

2626
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:20,480
Can someone,

2627
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:22,480
if I open a peel box,

2628
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:24,480
can someone send me brown three by one?

2629
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:26,480
I just need brown three by one.

2630
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:28,480
That's all.

2631
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:30,480
I don't ask for much as a streamer,

2632
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:32,480
but if I open a peel box,

2633
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:34,480
that was my ankle cracking if you heard that

2634
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:36,480
before someone's like, hey.

2635
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,480
Oh my god.

2636
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,480

2641
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:06,480

that does beef bowl and just a bit yackadon no wait is that that popcorn terminology you told me

2877
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:35,360
it's like a beef bowl it's literally like cheese rice and beef and I'm like that's exactly

2878
02:19:35,360 --> 02:19:39,440
like the kind of food I focus in like the food's bland in Japan and that and I'm like

2879
02:19:40,640 --> 02:19:45,120
to me it's actually like the best kind of food because like you didn't need like a

2880
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:51,920
billion different flavorings and seasonings and all that like if you do it you know your stuff then

2881
02:19:52,880 --> 02:19:57,440
oh sorry I just realized you can't even fucking see anything I'm doing right now I am so sorry I'm

2882
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:06,800
wait oh my god sorry

2883
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:14,080
um what where do you go

2884
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:20,720
it goes under the pool right but by one

2885
02:20:25,920 --> 02:20:33,360
whatever is you're doing stop it sorry I need to press them like strategically

2886
02:20:34,320 --> 02:20:36,400
I need to press them on it or somewhere

2887
02:20:39,360 --> 02:20:44,960
uh I hope it's not bland no it's not bland it's like you got like the perfect

2888
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:51,840
like it's not overwhelming stuff like that I'm putting the fashion touches on the windows

2889
02:20:52,000 --> 02:21:03,840
oh whoa whoa the whole bit of fucking garden just came off as well how did I not notice this

2890
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:11,440
me like oh yeah not always good no it does not look good but not like

2891
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:26,160
I'm definitely not doing something right but the good news is I'm having fun

2892
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:35,520
so even if this goes horrifically wrong I'm having a good time and I'm glad to get to spend it

2893
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:39,680
together I like doing something a bit different as well like this feels different from like

2894
02:21:40,320 --> 02:21:43,360
sitting down and plop plop plopping on a video game

2895
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:07,680
mummies we think you are unable to apply enough pressure I'm I'm very weak unfortunately my

2896
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:12,640
grand I think it's like whoa wait hold on

2897
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:22,160
nothing there ah right this is literally the piece that I'm supposed to do first

2898
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:27,280
use your brain where is it where's your brain come on stop

2899
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:28,640
you run

2900
02:22:31,360 --> 02:22:37,440
say this line where is your brain right that's it user send me content so I can just

2901
02:22:37,440 --> 02:22:42,880
content one I've had enough I've had enough all right that was the one sansone two brown

2902
02:22:45,440 --> 02:22:51,120
this thoughtful method is so fucking superior though I don't care

2903
02:22:52,080 --> 02:22:57,760
right one two three four five six and then one long green one skinny green

2904
02:22:59,680 --> 02:23:02,560
are you hydrating me Flynn am I going to have to fart in your mouth

2905
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:07,920
oh my god it's been another hour are you joking god I can yet

2906
02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:15,360
how does Deldo Baggins do it don't you call him that he did not go through hell on earth for

2907
02:23:15,440 --> 02:23:23,200
that he's a good man mummy says she has peasant genes but I think she would be a terrible fan

2908
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:28,800
oh no I'm the peasant that like cleans the halls and serves like I mean I've already

2909
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:34,320
been a waitress and I can manage the waitress and so I think I'm just destined to be a waitress like

2910
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:37,680
I'm gonna work at a cafe

2911
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:46,240
or I might get a job at my boss lady's shop and she's always nice to me but you hide him

2912
02:23:46,240 --> 02:23:51,280
and she'd be like what the fuck do you want to hide me

2913
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:59,120
okay we add the sandstone and then the one green here what an interesting

2914
02:24:00,640 --> 02:24:04,880
thing and then one wee piece though and one long piece

2915
02:24:07,760 --> 02:24:09,280
one skinny long piece

2916
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:11,760
skinny long piece

2917
02:24:14,320 --> 02:24:16,800
and then is that gonna be in my dog's bowl

2918
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:22,000
no it's in my dog's bowl okay

2919
02:24:24,640 --> 02:24:26,080
is it it is

2920
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:31,360
curious can you hear on your phone where does it go

2921
02:24:32,240 --> 02:24:34,240
oh it goes in the corner right

2922
02:24:34,960 --> 02:24:36,960
yeah

2923
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:43,840
yeah if we ever do this again I'm probably going to do those like you know those pokemon

2924
02:24:44,400 --> 02:24:49,280
ones that have like a hundred pieces and no more yeah that's probably much more in my speed

2925
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:53,840
this is advanced I don't care what anyone says this is hard

2926
02:24:55,680 --> 02:25:01,680
and strongy what do you mean it's hard all you're doing is putting these pieces right you know what

2927
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:09,520
in life you will meet a variety of people some people enjoy a nice calm experience

2928
02:25:09,520 --> 02:25:14,640
where they don't have to think okay it's the best pleasure in life where you don't have to think

2929
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:21,680
for yourself okay I said what I said and I made it I want to be dumb I want to be collared

2930
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:24,640
hmm fuck ass naked

2931
02:25:28,880 --> 02:25:32,560
sorry I'm I'm actually losing it I'm genuinely losing it a little bit

2932
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:40,640
I think it's because I can't read you either it's making like I'm having to look around

2933
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:48,240
but what is the age group of this activity too damn low because this is in life there's real

2934
02:25:48,240 --> 02:25:56,080
work everyone is bad at something it's nice to see it coming together it is I do agree the birds

2935
02:25:56,080 --> 02:26:05,280
are chirping I severely underestimated how long this was gonna take and because my dummy dumb dumb

2936
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:13,200
ass was like haha I will get so much work done after the stream I think my brain's like what are you

2937
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:15,600
doing

2938
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:23,360
right one grass courage got it and what the rest are in here oh they are two little fans

2939
02:26:25,040 --> 02:26:28,400
and then one week bit where it is there is

2940
02:26:31,120 --> 02:26:36,000
I love this old moment so please why are you being so mean

2941
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:44,160
you're okay that's a m&m song

2942
02:26:50,160 --> 02:26:59,840
it's like levity but why why are you levity oh sometimes the simplest solution is also the easiest

2943
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:03,040
and sometimes in life the easiest solution is a shift

2944
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:09,760
it's like putting a bandage over a gash

2945
02:27:12,240 --> 02:27:12,560
whoa

2946
02:27:15,440 --> 02:27:23,360
oh it's literally just goes on the window thank goodness thank goodness my window's coming together

2947
02:27:23,440 --> 02:27:27,920
cute cut off fingers yeah you like mom's fingers look oh my god

2948
02:27:31,360 --> 02:27:37,920
it's so cool are you mean I already done this page okay I'm kind of blasting through it I think

2949
02:27:37,920 --> 02:27:46,160
maybe the problem with time is just like having to rake around for the objects like so hard

2950
02:27:46,880 --> 02:27:53,520
versus this method that we're doing right now is pretty pretty okay that's a flat square I need

2951
02:27:54,720 --> 02:28:03,920
I need a lean grass verge any grass verge appreciators any appreciators a good grass

2952
02:28:04,880 --> 02:28:08,240
I mean what the f**k am I doing

2953
02:28:13,760 --> 02:28:15,760
well that one definitely goes there

2954
02:28:18,400 --> 02:28:23,680
and then there's a wee off piece here right okay

2955
02:28:24,240 --> 02:28:33,600
uh right I need to hammer it then oh the freak it down oh did you see that

2956
02:28:34,320 --> 02:28:35,840
it's paint back into the bowl

2957
02:28:40,800 --> 02:28:41,760
you don't want to go in

2958
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:47,920
why not go in but then where does this one go it says I need to two

2959
02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:49,920
two

2960
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:55,040
hold on well look at the schematics

2961
02:28:56,880 --> 02:29:01,520
oh I'm raising this one here

2962
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:09,440
okay but that still doesn't explain where this one goes this is here

2963
02:29:12,160 --> 02:29:15,040
oh that doesn't explain us

2964
02:29:18,880 --> 02:29:25,840
it's not in oh I see it I see it I see it I see it I see it I see it I see snow paws

2966
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:37,520
barrier there's a new patreon audio I now no longer deal with the patreon audio

2967
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:44,800
so you're a problem now that's right you have to edit the girls audios and then listen to it

2968
02:29:45,440 --> 02:29:50,640
yes we okay what do I need I need six barrels

2969
02:29:56,640 --> 02:30:02,560

2971
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:16,000
the light in my room honestly okay right three in a row up the window three in a row up the window

2972
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:21,280
and I must remember that you should be able to see it

2973
02:30:24,880 --> 02:30:30,000
three in a row up the room up the room up the room up the room up the room up the room

doing

2977
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:59,840
and then I need two wee greenians just the one more for ones and flat

2978
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,880
I too am somewhat familiar with the concept of flat

2979
02:31:08,320 --> 02:31:10,240
okay and I'm gonna put it on the end

2980
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:18,640
oh my freaking crack a larkin trying to get this piece in

2981
02:31:22,400 --> 02:31:30,880
it's like go okay then and then put this up oh my gosh it's all coming together

2982
02:31:31,520 --> 02:31:34,320
oh my god oh my god

2983
02:31:39,280 --> 02:31:41,200
just say cute in french you say

2984
02:31:53,360 --> 02:31:57,360
yes I just did sth in french what you're gonna do about it huh you're gonna twerk

2985
02:32:01,360 --> 02:32:05,200
yes for these

2986
02:32:09,360 --> 02:32:11,200
I called you

2987
02:32:16,080 --> 02:32:19,680
I'm gonna shoot what if I want to do both

2988
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:40,560
and one more how do you even attach the door that that's a concept my small mind can

2989
02:32:41,840 --> 02:32:44,000
oh I found it I found it I found it I found it

2990
02:32:46,160 --> 02:32:52,480
like we're rummaging e-smart right let's get right into whatever that is this thing

2991
02:32:53,040 --> 02:33:05,040
okay one do that two do this and then three

2992
02:33:12,640 --> 02:33:13,280
like that

2993
02:33:17,680 --> 02:33:19,360
but there's a burn piece as well

2994
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:31,040
hold on this requires and hi IQ what am I looking at

2995
02:33:36,320 --> 02:33:40,880
is it a flat burn bit at once no this has got a slope on it

2996
02:33:42,720 --> 02:33:49,040
although in productions to a halt production is to a halt it's a standstill what

2997
02:33:49,680 --> 02:33:53,760
it looks like an arrow point

2998
02:33:57,200 --> 02:34:03,360
is it on the outside is my question hold on hold on hold on enolize

2999
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:11,840
it would go like so that's step two the whole piece is there that piece is like ready to

3000
02:34:12,800 --> 02:34:22,640
oh no it's not oh it is and then it's like that like it just sits on it for some texture

3001
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:27,760
that's where my money's going right now

3002
02:34:30,320 --> 02:34:38,160
that's where my money's going right now oh oh I see it now I see it now it's 3d it's 3d

3003
02:34:38,240 --> 02:34:43,840
thinking 3d love thinking three dimensions thinking three dimensions

3004
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:47,040
they're pointing downwards let me so much more sense than what I was thinking

3005
02:34:49,200 --> 02:34:52,400
what are you thinking about oh we did it we did it we just have to

3006
02:34:53,600 --> 02:35:02,640
no I can't laugh yet okay that looks much better than originally why are you

3007
02:35:02,640 --> 02:35:05,120
doing

3008
02:35:05,120 --> 02:35:14,640
you know what can wet okay turn it a little bit and then do it now for the piece that goes that way

3009
02:35:14,640 --> 02:35:26,880
so flip it in your brain right and then do that right and then it's like this right yes and then

3010
02:35:26,880 --> 02:35:34,720
do it like that okay oh we fucking nailed it this is for nine year olds by the way

3011
02:35:35,520 --> 02:35:41,760
you just thought you should know that I just you know that small detail that this is for nine

3012
02:35:41,760 --> 02:35:47,200
year olds yeah I don't know what freaking super genius nine year olds would be built in this

3013
02:35:47,200 --> 02:36:00,560
way they say but bruv bruv this is not easy okay no add that thing and add to that one

3014
02:36:02,640 --> 02:36:10,800
okay okay all right all right you did it boom I'm just checking that's right

3015
02:36:11,520 --> 02:36:18,880
okay and then we go to the next step thank god it's something easy I just need two brown

3016
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:27,520
chocolate barrette oh no go back in the ball what I need one two three I need a six two six by two

3017
02:36:28,320 --> 02:36:33,280
how's that how's that I am to turn it around

3018
02:36:37,520 --> 02:36:44,320
make sure you can see and to turn it around and I am to place the brown on top

3019
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:51,280
please don't gain any IQ you're perfect you are oh yeah it's all coming together she doesn't want to

3020
02:36:51,280 --> 02:37:00,480
know what kind of difficult legos you were doing I don't know I'm very I'm very how everyone knows

3021
02:37:01,360 --> 02:37:06,960
so I'm to

3022
02:37:11,840 --> 02:37:12,160
I have

3023
02:37:26,800 --> 02:37:27,280
hold on

3024
02:37:31,440 --> 02:37:34,720
ah okay not a big deal it was just these

3025
02:37:36,320 --> 02:37:41,760
it was it was the door was not that tall this is for hobbits okay it the door is not that

3026
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:47,440
tall it is not necessary for it to be that tall that makes a lot more sense I was panicking I was

3027
02:37:47,440 --> 02:37:54,640
like ah I've completely messed it up again what are the odds oh shocking okay fine next one by four

3028
02:37:54,800 --> 02:38:04,640
sand I have that okay I know this is for the doorway but what is the best part of Scotland

3029

3033
02:38:32,800 --> 02:38:42,000
corner with salt uh all over um I can't think of any other takeaway oh my god I get to oh my god

3034
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:55,520
the fireplace has detail oh my god it has a frying pan oh my god I never even saw that oh my god I'm a

3035
02:38:55,520 --> 02:39:04,240
chef I'm actually a chef because I'm cooking right we'll make the fireplace and thank you for the tip

3036
02:39:05,200 --> 02:39:11,600
uh typical nation Billy's mega chippy the fact you even know that's where

3037
02:39:12,800 --> 02:39:19,840
right what I'm about to take out I'm to take out the contract I'm to take out

3038
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:33,120
a frying pan did I take it out no I put it back in cheeky and the oh oh okay it's cheeky frying

3039
02:39:33,520 --> 02:39:41,280
and then a bottle it looks like a bottle with something inside it for a prop but I don't

3040
02:39:45,120 --> 02:39:46,720
another thing they haven't included

3041
02:39:49,440 --> 02:39:56,720
potentially I'll know I'll know by then right okay connect one piece onto the other

3042
02:39:57,680 --> 02:40:03,360
on top of them add the two hook pieces okay

3043
02:40:08,240 --> 02:40:17,760
I don't have the strength for this like um surely there's a simpler way like surely

3044
02:40:17,760 --> 02:40:25,680
there's a simpler way than breaking my I can't oh and Gimli stop nothing Gimli if I open that door

3045
02:40:25,680 --> 02:40:30,960
you're actually gonna come in and say this time are you just gonna stare at me in amazement of what

3046
02:40:30,960 --> 02:40:41,280
I'm doing when they're still moving and then what another one on top okay right I can do that

3047
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:46,240
and then what put the wait why is it asking for the no

3048
02:40:47,920 --> 02:40:50,640
oh it's telling me to place the items around wait maybe the

3049
02:40:56,080 --> 02:40:59,840
not that I can see okay I think we've just forgotten it right the chimney shaft

3050
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:05,280
who went up the ventilation shaft oh my god is that a Star Wars present

3051
02:41:06,080 --> 02:41:18,880
yeah

3052
02:41:31,440 --> 02:41:34,720
it shows the top of that but

3053
02:41:35,280 --> 02:41:44,280
Ah! Because these are wrong, that's why. One second, don't panic! Why do you always panic?

3054
02:41:44,280 --> 02:41:48,280
Just because I completely messed it up one time, didn't mean to do it again. I was like,

3055
02:41:48,280 --> 02:41:56,280
why is the top of the furnace exposed when I can't see it? Right, frying pan, furnace.

3056
02:41:56,280 --> 02:42:07,280
Um, the note in the bottle on the shelf over here, one in. That's the letter.

3057
02:42:07,280 --> 02:42:11,280
It used to be addressed to Bill Bowie with a little contract.

3058
02:42:11,280 --> 02:42:16,280
He's been stirring the thorn open shield and comforting and coal and coals.

3059
02:42:16,280 --> 02:42:20,280
Okay, hydration check. Gallaudet's famous for its seasonal depression, that last one.

3060
02:42:20,280 --> 02:42:26,280
Oh, okay. You're not wrong. You're not wrong because of the lack of sunlight.

3061
02:42:26,280 --> 02:42:34,280
I think about over, like, 50% of the UK-like experience is depression.

3062
02:42:34,280 --> 02:42:40,280
Uh, no, not chicken tikka masala. Scots do love a good curry.

3063
02:42:40,280 --> 02:42:46,280
We love Indians because they have delicious food and they bring it and it's delicious.

3064
02:42:46,280 --> 02:42:55,280
Um, right, I don't have the bottle. It's asking for the broomstick, right?

3065
02:42:55,280 --> 02:42:59,280
Whereas that was in your one. Give me the broomstick.

3066
02:42:59,280 --> 02:43:06,280
There is broomstick and then a cup and then two pillars, which I do have right here.

3067
02:43:06,280 --> 02:43:12,280
Oh, pardon. And then a cup.

3068
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:17,280
Right, we're putting the cup on the stove, I guess.

3069
02:43:17,280 --> 02:43:23,280
Well, if it was all cast iron, or however we call it, it would 100%.

3070
02:43:23,280 --> 02:43:26,280
And then we're putting the broom away.

3071
02:43:26,280 --> 02:43:28,280
Oh, please don't break it.

3072
02:43:28,280 --> 02:43:31,280
Right, okay, broom's away.

3073
02:43:31,280 --> 02:43:37,280
And then we're ploughing down the wheat fellers.

3074
02:43:37,280 --> 02:43:41,280
Oh my God, it's all coming together.

3075
02:43:41,280 --> 02:43:49,280
Yes, that's that one. Yeah, unfortunately, I don't see a bottle unless I'm staring at it, but these look like ones and stuff, so...

3076
02:43:49,280 --> 02:43:53,280
Unfortunately, your bottle is missing from pack number two.

3077
02:43:53,280 --> 02:43:59,280
Oh!

3078
02:43:59,280 --> 02:44:06,280
This is the bottom of the fucking shelf.

3079
02:44:06,280 --> 02:44:12,280
Where did that come from?

3080
02:44:12,280 --> 02:44:15,280
What?

3081
02:44:15,280 --> 02:44:19,280
Can I just slot it in without having to like...

3082
02:44:19,280 --> 02:44:24,280
Are you serious, you little fucking shit?

3083
02:44:24,280 --> 02:44:27,280
Is that really the bottom of the shelf?

3084
02:44:27,280 --> 02:44:33,280
Hold on, let me just go ahead to make sure there's no brown half fucking piece.

3085
02:44:33,280 --> 02:44:41,280
I swear to God, if that's the bottom of the fucking shelf, I'm ripping bag end out to put it down.

3086
02:44:41,280 --> 02:44:47,280
Oh, let me guess, and then what, the glass of wine's gonna fall out my ass crack next.

3087
02:44:47,280 --> 02:44:49,280
Are you serious?

3088
02:44:49,280 --> 02:44:53,280
Are you scolding me right now?

3089
02:44:53,280 --> 02:44:57,280
Where did that come from? Was that in...?

3090
02:44:57,280 --> 02:44:59,280
Right, can I gently somehow...

3091
02:44:59,280 --> 02:45:03,280
Careful now, I didn't get too easy.

3092
02:45:03,280 --> 02:45:09,280
Can I somehow very gently take out these shelves without destroying...

3093
02:45:09,280 --> 02:45:17,280
Without destroying the integrity of bag end?

3094
02:45:17,280 --> 02:45:22,280
Right, okay.

3095
02:45:22,280 --> 02:45:26,280
I mean, it's a very difficult kind of thing.

3096
02:45:26,280 --> 02:45:29,280
Pop that there.

3097
02:45:29,280 --> 02:45:33,280
If I have to redo the shelf, I'll redo the shelf.

3098
02:45:33,280 --> 02:45:35,280
Okay, gently.

3099
02:45:35,280 --> 02:45:37,280
Okay, good, we've got a big piece together.

3100
02:45:37,280 --> 02:45:40,280
Right, and then you can come off and you don't need to be supported anymore,

3101
02:45:40,280 --> 02:45:44,280
because I found a fucking mission, peace!

3102
02:45:44,280 --> 02:45:47,280
I don't know where it came from, I'm just happy it showed up.

3103
02:45:47,280 --> 02:45:52,280
I'm not mad at you, I'm just disappointed you were hiding from me, okay?

3104
02:45:52,280 --> 02:45:54,280
I have plans that I cannot speak of.

3105
02:45:54,280 --> 02:45:57,280
Speak of what?

3106
02:45:57,280 --> 02:46:03,280
Right, how the fuck do you put the shelf in here?

3107
02:46:03,280 --> 02:46:05,280
Lego experience? Is it?

3108
02:46:05,280 --> 02:46:09,280
Is this what everyone has to go through underneath?

3109
02:46:09,280 --> 02:46:12,280
That doesn't look right.

3110
02:46:12,280 --> 02:46:15,280
Because it's not, this piece comes out...

3111
02:46:15,280 --> 02:46:20,280
Come on, come back off the empty floor.

3112
02:46:20,280 --> 02:46:24,280
It's this knob.

3113
02:46:24,280 --> 02:46:30,280
My fingers are really starting to feel sore.

3114
02:46:30,280 --> 02:46:34,280
Is that normal?

3115
02:46:34,280 --> 02:46:41,280
Aren't I just such a dainty queen?

3116
02:46:41,280 --> 02:46:47,280
What are you doing?

3117
02:46:47,280 --> 02:46:50,280
Lego, you're killing me.

3118
02:46:50,280 --> 02:46:54,280
I don't think Lego is friendly to people with an old sense.

3119
02:46:54,280 --> 02:46:58,280
I'm not going to be able to play any of my video games properly.

3120
02:46:58,280 --> 02:47:02,280
Why are you playing like that when I'm playing one of these different games?

3121
02:47:02,280 --> 02:47:06,280
I can't say please forgive me.

3122
02:47:06,280 --> 02:47:09,280
Get the fucking shelf in.

3123
02:47:09,280 --> 02:47:12,280
Yeah, you've heard of Elf on a shelf.

3124
02:47:12,280 --> 02:47:18,280
You've heard of... have a month from something?

3125
02:47:18,280 --> 02:47:25,280
What?

3126
02:47:25,280 --> 02:47:30,280
I don't...

3127
02:47:30,280 --> 02:47:33,280
What am I looking at?

3128
02:47:33,280 --> 02:47:37,280
Right, so I don't know how I've done this, but...

3129
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:41,280
I don't know how I've done that, but hey, well...

3130
02:47:41,280 --> 02:47:45,280
Look, it still came out the same.

3131
02:47:45,280 --> 02:47:47,280
Like, that's still what it asked for.

3132
02:47:47,280 --> 02:47:49,280
They are...

3133
02:47:49,280 --> 02:47:51,280
Right, there we go.

3134
02:47:51,280 --> 02:47:53,280
Gorgeous, stunning.

3135
02:47:53,280 --> 02:47:55,280
Don't fucking hate another piece of me again.

3136
02:47:55,280 --> 02:47:57,280
Hydration chick.

3137
02:47:57,280 --> 02:47:58,280
That looks right, right?

3138
02:47:58,280 --> 02:48:00,280
That is right.

3139
02:48:00,280 --> 02:48:01,280
My wee shelf.

3140
02:48:01,280 --> 02:48:03,280
My wee elf on a shelf.

3141
02:48:03,280 --> 02:48:05,280
Gorgeous.

3142
02:48:05,280 --> 02:48:07,280
Gorgeous, it's perfect.

3143
02:48:08,280 --> 02:48:14,280
No more magical shelf.

3144
02:48:14,280 --> 02:48:16,280
Strony on the Johnny is the best.

3145
02:48:16,280 --> 02:48:18,280
I can do nothing cool.

3146
02:48:18,280 --> 02:48:20,280
So I can hear birds on the roof right now.

3147
02:48:20,280 --> 02:48:23,280
They're probably like, where the fuck is there, dude?

3148
02:48:23,280 --> 02:48:25,280
Right, we've made back in.

3149
02:48:25,280 --> 02:48:26,280
Right, okay.

3150
02:48:26,280 --> 02:48:30,280
Now this is where things start looking a bit unfamiliar.

3151
02:48:30,280 --> 02:48:32,280
What the fuck is this?

3152
02:48:32,280 --> 02:48:35,280
It says I need that golden thing.

3153
02:48:35,280 --> 02:48:37,280
I need the big arch.

3154
02:48:37,280 --> 02:48:39,280
I need two big arches like that.

3155
02:48:39,280 --> 02:48:41,280
Okay, I'm definitely making the door.

3156
02:48:41,280 --> 02:48:43,280
That looks like...

3157
02:48:43,280 --> 02:48:45,280
I need four.

3158
02:48:45,280 --> 02:48:47,280
Seen through.

3159
02:48:47,280 --> 02:48:49,280
Oh, here we go.

3160
02:48:49,280 --> 02:48:51,280
Hold on.

3161
02:48:53,280 --> 02:48:55,280
I can't pick it up.

3162
02:48:57,280 --> 02:48:59,280
There we go.

3163
02:49:01,280 --> 02:49:03,280
You know, who's thought of nails?

3164
02:49:03,280 --> 02:49:05,280
Who's thought of nails?

3165
02:49:11,280 --> 02:49:13,280
Four black ones.

3166
02:49:13,280 --> 02:49:15,280
One wee door.

3167
02:49:17,280 --> 02:49:19,280
Wait, what?

3168
02:49:19,280 --> 02:49:21,280
Why would I need one door?

3169
02:49:23,280 --> 02:49:25,280
Maybe just do it in steps.

3170
02:49:25,280 --> 02:49:27,280
So part one to the...

3171
02:49:27,280 --> 02:49:29,280
What the fuck?

3172
02:49:29,280 --> 02:49:32,280
Could they not assemble this part?

3173
02:49:32,280 --> 02:49:35,280
I don't know what it's gonna click.

3174
02:49:35,280 --> 02:49:38,280
This doesn't look like it's gonna click.

3175
02:49:39,280 --> 02:49:41,280
Oh, there we go.

3176
02:49:41,280 --> 02:49:43,280
But that's not correct.

3177
02:49:43,280 --> 02:49:45,280
Like this.

3178
02:49:47,280 --> 02:49:51,280
This is rather curious, this stitch.

3179
02:49:59,280 --> 02:50:01,280
Okay, hold on.

3180
02:50:03,280 --> 02:50:05,280
I think...

3181
02:50:05,280 --> 02:50:08,280
Do they have to be a certain way?

3182
02:50:10,280 --> 02:50:12,280
Or am I just so weak?

3183
02:50:12,280 --> 02:50:14,280
I can't click it.

3184
02:50:14,280 --> 02:50:16,280
No, that can't be right.

3185
02:50:16,280 --> 02:50:18,280
No, turn it around, you dumbass.

3186
02:50:18,280 --> 02:50:20,280
Okay, turn it around if it doesn't fit.

3187
02:50:23,280 --> 02:50:25,280
Okay, there.

3188
02:50:25,280 --> 02:50:27,280
Step two, complete.

3189
02:50:27,280 --> 02:50:29,280
Step three, turn it around.

3190
02:50:29,280 --> 02:50:31,280
Step two, complete.

3191
02:50:31,280 --> 02:50:33,280
Step three, turn it over.

3192
02:50:33,280 --> 02:50:35,280
Turn it over.

3193
02:50:35,280 --> 02:50:37,280
What the fuck is going on?

3194
02:50:39,280 --> 02:50:41,280
Step four.

3195
02:50:41,280 --> 02:50:43,280
Place this...

3196
02:50:48,280 --> 02:50:50,280
Put the...

3197
02:50:50,280 --> 02:50:52,280
The hinge pieces?

3198
02:50:52,280 --> 02:50:54,280
Right.

3199
02:50:54,280 --> 02:50:56,280
Step four says...

3200
02:50:56,280 --> 02:50:58,280
What?

3201
02:50:58,280 --> 02:51:01,280
The door actually is gonna turn?

3202
02:51:03,280 --> 02:51:05,280
I'm getting nervous.

3203
02:51:05,280 --> 02:51:07,280
The door is gonna turn?

3204
02:51:07,280 --> 02:51:09,280
Can Lego do that?

3205
02:51:10,280 --> 02:51:14,280
I thought it was just stationary.

3206
02:51:14,280 --> 02:51:16,280
Hmm?

3207
02:51:26,280 --> 02:51:28,280
What?

3208
02:51:30,280 --> 02:51:32,280
Um...

3209
02:51:34,280 --> 02:51:37,280
I'm afraid something's no clicking.

3210
02:51:38,280 --> 02:51:40,280
It's like asking me to do that?

3211
02:51:40,280 --> 02:51:42,280
But it doesn't go on there.

3212
02:51:47,280 --> 02:51:49,280
What?

3213
02:51:49,280 --> 02:51:51,280
I'm not doing that.

3214
02:51:51,280 --> 02:51:53,280
This tends to be how doors work.

3215
02:51:53,280 --> 02:51:55,280
Welcome to Advanced Level.

3216
02:51:55,280 --> 02:51:57,280
Lego has a line of robotics too.

3217
02:51:58,280 --> 02:52:00,280
Uh...

3218
02:52:02,280 --> 02:52:04,280
What?

3219
02:52:04,280 --> 02:52:06,280
What?

3220
02:52:09,280 --> 02:52:11,280
Uh...

3221
02:52:11,280 --> 02:52:13,280
Mummy, for the car that I've built,

3222
02:52:13,280 --> 02:52:16,280
they made an engine that was moving forward?

3223
02:52:16,280 --> 02:52:18,280
What?

3224
02:52:19,280 --> 02:52:21,280
This is a bit too advanced for me.

3225
02:52:21,280 --> 02:52:23,280
What?

3226
02:52:24,280 --> 02:52:27,280
Hold on. Bear with me. Bear with me.

3227
02:52:29,280 --> 02:52:31,280
Put a golden...

3228
02:52:32,280 --> 02:52:36,280
Put a yellow dot in a brown tooth.

3229
02:52:37,280 --> 02:52:39,280
A smooth brown tooth.

3230
02:52:40,280 --> 02:52:42,280
On a yellow dot.

3231
02:52:42,280 --> 02:52:44,280
And what would that be?

3232
02:52:44,280 --> 02:52:46,280
I know I'm skipping ahead a part.

3233
02:52:46,280 --> 02:52:48,280
I am...

3234
02:52:49,280 --> 02:52:53,280
Rather perplexed at the current agenda.

3235
02:52:57,280 --> 02:52:59,280
Of what the fuck I'm supposed to do.

3236
02:52:59,280 --> 02:53:02,280
I'm just going to do another part before that.

3237
02:53:02,280 --> 02:53:04,280
Cause I don't see...

3238
02:53:05,280 --> 02:53:07,280
I'm getting it.

3239
02:53:07,280 --> 02:53:09,280
So this is going to be the hinge.

3240
02:53:11,280 --> 02:53:13,280
But then what's going to hold it together?

3241
02:53:13,280 --> 02:53:17,280
These two long yellow parts.

3242
02:53:17,280 --> 02:53:21,280
These two long yellow parts are going to...

3243
02:53:21,280 --> 02:53:23,280
hold...

3244
02:53:24,280 --> 02:53:28,280
No, it's not. What's going to hold it together?

3245
02:53:29,280 --> 02:53:31,280
Hold.

3246
02:53:35,280 --> 02:53:37,280
Hold.

3247
02:53:37,280 --> 02:53:39,280
Hold.

3248
02:53:42,280 --> 02:53:45,280
What's going to hold it together?

3249
02:53:50,280 --> 02:53:55,280
Nothing holds it together other than sheer physics.

3250
02:53:56,280 --> 02:53:59,280
So that symbol says shove that up its thigh.

3251
02:53:59,280 --> 02:54:01,280
Oh!

3252
02:54:01,280 --> 02:54:03,280
You didn't hear that.

3253
02:54:04,280 --> 02:54:06,280
Oh my god.

3254
02:54:06,280 --> 02:54:08,280
Okay, j'ai compris.

3255
02:54:08,280 --> 02:54:10,280
J'ai compris. Désolé.

3256
02:54:10,280 --> 02:54:12,280
Désolé. J'ai compris.

3257
02:54:14,280 --> 02:54:17,280
It needs to do this, right?

3258
02:54:20,280 --> 02:54:22,280
Okay.

3259
02:54:22,280 --> 02:54:25,280
Okay, I was ramming it in from the side.

3260
02:54:25,280 --> 02:54:27,280
All I'm saying is...

3261
02:54:27,280 --> 02:54:29,280
I couldn't find a hole.

3262
02:54:29,280 --> 02:54:32,280
It was running...

3263
02:54:32,280 --> 02:54:34,280
Bro, please go in.

3264
02:54:34,280 --> 02:54:35,280
Right.

3265
02:54:35,280 --> 02:54:37,280
Okay, let's recalibrate.

3266
02:54:38,280 --> 02:54:40,280
Let's recalibrate.

3267
02:54:40,280 --> 02:54:42,280
Turn it.

3268
02:54:44,280 --> 02:54:46,280
I'm fucking done already.

3269
02:54:46,280 --> 02:54:48,280
Hold on.

3270
02:54:49,280 --> 02:54:51,280
Right.

3271
02:54:51,280 --> 02:54:53,280
What?

3272
02:54:53,280 --> 02:54:55,280
Okay, okay.

3273
02:54:56,280 --> 02:54:58,280
I'm sorry.

3274
02:54:58,280 --> 02:55:00,280
I'm sorry.

3275
02:55:00,280 --> 02:55:02,280
That's literally all I can see right now.

3276
02:55:02,280 --> 02:55:04,280
I'm sorry.

3277
02:55:04,280 --> 02:55:06,280
I'm sorry.

3278
02:55:06,280 --> 02:55:07,280
Oh!

3279
02:55:07,280 --> 02:55:09,280
What are you saying?

3280
02:55:09,280 --> 02:55:11,280
It was hard to find the right hole.

3281
02:55:11,280 --> 02:55:13,280
Inkling.

3282
02:55:14,280 --> 02:55:16,280
Ugh.

3283
02:55:16,280 --> 02:55:19,280
How far are we in?

3284
02:55:19,280 --> 02:55:21,280
Three hours.

3285
02:55:21,280 --> 02:55:23,280
Three fucking hours.

3286
02:55:23,280 --> 02:55:26,280
This is all I have to show for it.

3287
02:55:26,280 --> 02:55:29,280
I hope the next set is easier.

3288
02:55:29,280 --> 02:55:32,280
I swear. Part three and four, baby.

3289
02:55:32,280 --> 02:55:33,280
Right.

3290
02:55:33,280 --> 02:55:35,280
Back to the problem.

3291
02:55:35,280 --> 02:55:37,280
The fucking door.

3292
02:55:37,280 --> 02:55:39,280
Right.

3293
02:55:39,280 --> 02:55:41,280
Put it there.

3294
02:55:41,280 --> 02:55:43,280
Right.

3295
02:55:43,280 --> 02:55:45,280
Mm-hmm.

3296
02:55:45,280 --> 02:55:47,280
Mm-hmm.

3297
02:55:47,280 --> 02:55:49,280
Right, okay.

3298
02:55:49,280 --> 02:55:51,280
And then it'll kiss, right?

3299
02:55:51,280 --> 02:55:53,280
And they'll make out and wherever we love each other.

3300
02:55:53,280 --> 02:55:55,280
Okay.

3301
02:55:55,280 --> 02:55:57,280
There you are.

3302
02:55:57,280 --> 02:55:59,280
The gap is today.

3303
02:55:59,280 --> 02:56:01,280
What?

3304
02:56:01,280 --> 02:56:03,280
The gap is tomorrow.

3305
02:56:03,280 --> 02:56:05,280
No, definitely not.

3306
02:56:05,280 --> 02:56:07,280
I mean...

3307
02:56:07,280 --> 02:56:09,280
Right.

3308
02:56:09,280 --> 02:56:11,280
So, to make them kiss,

3309
02:56:11,280 --> 02:56:13,280
then on one of them,

3310
02:56:13,280 --> 02:56:17,280
add to the top of the door,

3311
02:56:17,280 --> 02:56:19,280
and then

3312
02:56:19,280 --> 02:56:21,280
to...

3313
02:56:21,280 --> 02:56:23,280
to end blocks.

3314
02:56:23,280 --> 02:56:25,280
To end blocks.

3315
02:56:25,280 --> 02:56:27,280
End blocks.

3316
02:56:27,280 --> 02:56:31,280
Oh, I'm really far right now.

3317
02:56:31,280 --> 02:56:35,280
I'm not going to be a good girl, hold on.

3318
02:56:35,280 --> 02:56:37,280
Sorry, bright blue.

3319
02:56:37,280 --> 02:56:39,280
Mm-hmm.

3320
02:56:41,280 --> 02:56:43,280
Right.

3321
02:56:43,280 --> 02:56:45,280
Oh, that's my stomach.

3322
02:56:45,280 --> 02:56:47,280
Mm-hmm.

3323
02:56:47,280 --> 02:56:49,280
Oh, no, don't do that.

3324
02:56:49,280 --> 02:56:51,280
Please don't ever do that again, my baby.

3325
02:56:51,280 --> 02:56:53,280
Okay.

3326
02:56:53,280 --> 02:56:55,280
No, I have to hold it.

3327
02:56:55,280 --> 02:56:57,280
Right.

3328
02:56:57,280 --> 02:56:59,280
And I take the door,

3329
02:56:59,280 --> 02:57:01,280
and where do I put it?

3330
02:57:01,280 --> 02:57:03,280
Here you are.

3331
02:57:03,280 --> 02:57:05,280
Please don't fall apart.

3332
02:57:05,280 --> 02:57:07,280
No.

3333
02:57:07,280 --> 02:57:09,280
I mean, it doesn't fit.

3334
02:57:11,280 --> 02:57:13,280
Have I fucked it?

3335
02:57:13,280 --> 02:57:15,280
Have I fucked it?

3336
02:57:21,280 --> 02:57:23,280
I mean...

3337
02:57:23,280 --> 02:57:25,280
Mm-hmm.

3338
02:57:25,280 --> 02:57:27,280
Mm-hmm.

3339
02:57:29,280 --> 02:57:31,280
Can you go in?

3340
02:57:31,280 --> 02:57:33,280
Mm-hmm.

3341
02:57:33,280 --> 02:57:35,280
Uh...

3342
02:57:35,280 --> 02:57:37,280
It doesn't fit.

3343
02:57:37,280 --> 02:57:39,280
It's stuck off in place.

3344
02:57:39,280 --> 02:57:41,280
Why would you tell me to put the pillars in place?

3345
02:57:41,280 --> 02:57:43,280
No.

3346
02:57:43,280 --> 02:57:45,280
Oh!

3347
02:57:45,280 --> 02:57:47,280
Wait, the pillars hold it in!

3348
02:57:47,280 --> 02:57:49,280
Oh, my God, it doesn't clip!

3349
02:57:49,280 --> 02:57:51,280
Oh!

3350
02:57:53,280 --> 02:57:55,280
Wait, no.

3351
02:57:55,280 --> 02:57:57,280
Analyze?

3352
02:57:57,280 --> 02:57:59,280
Analyze the problem.

3353
02:57:59,280 --> 02:58:01,280
Analyze this right now.

3354
02:58:01,280 --> 02:58:03,280
No, that's not gonna work.

3355
02:58:03,280 --> 02:58:05,280
So, don't do it like that.

3356
02:58:05,280 --> 02:58:07,280
Just...

3357
02:58:07,280 --> 02:58:09,280
Yeah.

3358
02:58:09,280 --> 02:58:11,280
No.

3359
02:58:11,280 --> 02:58:15,280
Why would you make something that doesn't stay in?

3360
02:58:15,280 --> 02:58:17,280
Like, why would you make the windows...

3361
02:58:17,280 --> 02:58:19,280
Am I losing it?

3362
02:58:19,280 --> 02:58:21,280
Nine-year-olds, by the way.

3363
02:58:21,280 --> 02:58:23,280
A nine-year-old is supposed to be

3364
02:58:23,280 --> 02:58:25,280
fucking farting about it.

3365
02:58:25,280 --> 02:58:27,280
Oh, no.

3366
02:58:27,280 --> 02:58:29,280
No.

3367
02:58:29,280 --> 02:58:31,280
Don't lose it.

3368
02:58:31,280 --> 02:58:33,280
I have to hold it.

3369
02:58:33,280 --> 02:58:35,280
I can lose it shortly, but not yet.

3370
02:58:35,280 --> 02:58:37,280
I'm not all right now.

3371
02:58:37,280 --> 02:58:39,280
Mm-hmm.

3372
02:58:39,280 --> 02:58:41,280
Okay.

3373
02:58:41,280 --> 02:58:43,280
Okay, hold on.

3374
02:58:43,280 --> 02:58:45,280
Let me slab explore.

3375
02:58:45,280 --> 02:58:47,280
This is the real solution.

3376
02:58:47,280 --> 02:58:49,280
If you are ever needing help in this,

3377
02:58:49,280 --> 02:58:51,280
just do the slab explore.

3378
02:58:51,280 --> 02:58:53,280
Slab explore.

3379
02:58:57,280 --> 02:58:59,280
Bag end.

3380
02:58:59,280 --> 02:59:01,280
It might be crumbling around itself right now.

3381
02:59:01,280 --> 02:59:03,280
Okay.

3382
02:59:03,280 --> 02:59:05,280
Okay, and then let's...

3383
02:59:05,280 --> 02:59:07,280
Okay.

3384
02:59:07,280 --> 02:59:09,280
Right, and then just rotate the window a little bit.

3385
02:59:09,280 --> 02:59:11,280
No, just...

3386
02:59:11,280 --> 02:59:13,280
Oh, now you don't want to fucking rotate?

3387
02:59:13,280 --> 02:59:15,280
Are you serious?

3388
02:59:15,280 --> 02:59:17,280
Fucking rotate.

3389
02:59:17,280 --> 02:59:19,280
It doesn't want to rotate?

3390
02:59:19,280 --> 02:59:21,280
Who's in zone?

3391
02:59:21,280 --> 02:59:23,280
Oh, yeah.

3392
02:59:23,280 --> 02:59:25,280
No!

3393
02:59:25,280 --> 02:59:27,280
Mm-hmm.

3394
02:59:27,280 --> 02:59:29,280
Piece of ghost.

3395
02:59:29,280 --> 02:59:31,280
Hold on, let me fix my window.

3396
02:59:31,280 --> 02:59:33,280
My window is breaking.

3397
02:59:33,280 --> 02:59:35,280
Mm-hmm.

3398
02:59:35,280 --> 02:59:37,280
Is this supposed to be this

3399
02:59:37,280 --> 02:59:39,280
pernickity?

3400
02:59:39,280 --> 02:59:41,280
Or am I messing up?

3401
02:59:41,280 --> 02:59:43,280
I always choose the bricks over the chicks, honestly.

3402
02:59:43,280 --> 02:59:45,280
Make sure they try the college at your beta

3403
02:59:45,280 --> 02:59:47,280
if it's not for me.

3404
02:59:47,280 --> 02:59:49,280
Oh, I never downloaded it.

3405
02:59:49,280 --> 02:59:51,280
I was like, I'm not rushing to play a video.

3406
02:59:53,280 --> 02:59:55,280
Like, so I was just releasing the video.

3407
02:59:55,280 --> 02:59:57,280
Mm-hmm.

3408
02:59:57,280 --> 02:59:59,280
And then it'll be my problem.

3409
02:59:59,280 --> 03:00:01,280
Right.

3410
03:00:01,280 --> 03:00:03,280
Mm-hmm.

3411
03:00:03,280 --> 03:00:05,280
Mm-hmm.

3412
03:00:05,280 --> 03:00:07,280
And...

3413
03:00:07,280 --> 03:00:09,280
collect it.

3414
03:00:13,280 --> 03:00:15,280
Yep.

3415
03:00:15,280 --> 03:00:17,280
Ah, I messed it.

3416
03:00:17,280 --> 03:00:19,280
I messed it up.

3417
03:00:19,280 --> 03:00:21,280
I messed it up.

3418
03:00:21,280 --> 03:00:23,280
I messed it up.

3419
03:00:23,280 --> 03:00:25,280
Okay, that's the window.

3420
03:00:27,280 --> 03:00:29,280
It doesn't get

3421
03:00:29,280 --> 03:00:31,280
to touch anything else.

3422
03:00:31,280 --> 03:00:33,280
These pillows are what hold it up.

3423
03:00:33,280 --> 03:00:35,280
I messed it up.

3424
03:00:37,280 --> 03:00:39,280
Mm-hmm, yeah.

3425
03:00:41,280 --> 03:00:43,280
Down, down, down.

3426
03:00:45,280 --> 03:00:47,280
Up.

3427
03:00:47,280 --> 03:00:49,280
Something...

3428
03:00:49,280 --> 03:00:51,280
isn't...

3429
03:00:51,280 --> 03:00:53,280
flipping.

3430
03:00:53,280 --> 03:00:55,280
It's the window.

3431
03:00:55,280 --> 03:00:57,280
There's something about the window

3432
03:00:57,280 --> 03:00:59,280
that I've clearly fucked up.

3433
03:01:03,280 --> 03:01:05,280
I have to build on top of it as well.

3434
03:01:07,280 --> 03:01:09,280
Mm-hmm.

3435
03:01:09,280 --> 03:01:11,280
Mm-hmm.

3436
03:01:13,280 --> 03:01:15,280
Yay.

3437
03:01:17,280 --> 03:01:19,280
If I fuck something up,

3438
03:01:19,280 --> 03:01:21,280
can someone open up a YouTube tutorial?

3439
03:01:23,280 --> 03:01:25,280
Uh...

3440
03:01:25,280 --> 03:01:27,280
Mommy, look at the underside of the arch.

3441
03:01:27,280 --> 03:01:29,280
There's a gap. The whole of the window pieces

3442
03:01:29,280 --> 03:01:31,280
needs to slide up in the gap.

3443
03:01:33,280 --> 03:01:35,280
Am I Spanish?

3444
03:01:35,280 --> 03:01:37,280
No.

3445
03:01:37,280 --> 03:01:39,280
I'm Spanish.

3446
03:01:39,280 --> 03:01:41,280
Mommy, look under

3447
03:01:41,280 --> 03:01:43,280
the side of the arch.

3448
03:01:47,280 --> 03:01:49,280
The side... look under

3449
03:01:49,280 --> 03:01:51,280
the side

3450
03:01:51,280 --> 03:01:53,280
of the arch.

3451
03:01:57,280 --> 03:01:59,280
It's supposed to sit on it.

3452
03:01:59,280 --> 03:02:01,280
Wait, oh, right, no.

3453
03:02:01,280 --> 03:02:03,280
Sorry, I thought I had it.

3454
03:02:03,280 --> 03:02:05,280
Mm-hmm, it's because

3455
03:02:05,280 --> 03:02:07,280
there's pillars holding it together.

3456
03:02:07,280 --> 03:02:09,280
Hold on, hold on. I know you can't see it.

3457
03:02:09,280 --> 03:02:11,280
Allow me... no, I know. Allow me to enter that.

3458
03:02:11,280 --> 03:02:13,280
I'm struggling.

3459
03:02:15,280 --> 03:02:17,280
Oh, and I'm breaking it. Hold on.

3460
03:02:17,280 --> 03:02:19,280
Sorry. Mommy needs to be selfish

3461
03:02:19,280 --> 03:02:21,280
for a moment and get this fucking window.

3462
03:02:25,280 --> 03:02:27,280
I think that's...

3463
03:02:27,280 --> 03:02:29,280
Oh!

3464
03:02:29,280 --> 03:02:31,280
The fucking garden's gone.

3465
03:02:31,280 --> 03:02:33,280
Someone fixed the front garden.

3466
03:02:33,280 --> 03:02:35,280
No! The fucking corner!

3467
03:02:35,280 --> 03:02:37,280
No! Don't do this to me now, please.

3468
03:02:37,280 --> 03:02:39,280
Don't do this to me now.

3469
03:02:39,280 --> 03:02:41,280
I've been so good.

3470
03:02:41,280 --> 03:02:43,280
I've done so well.

3471
03:02:43,280 --> 03:02:45,280
Please.

3472
03:02:45,280 --> 03:02:47,280
Stop this madness.

3473
03:02:47,280 --> 03:02:49,280
You're giving me a heart attack, Lego.

3474
03:02:49,280 --> 03:02:51,280
Don't. Right, just leave the window.

3475
03:02:51,280 --> 03:02:53,280
The window's gorgeous.

3476
03:02:53,280 --> 03:02:55,280
It's like really not

3477
03:02:55,280 --> 03:02:57,280
correct.

3478
03:02:57,280 --> 03:02:59,280
I don't see how it's supposed to

3479
03:02:59,280 --> 03:03:01,280
fucking sit on anything.

3480
03:03:01,280 --> 03:03:03,280
I mean, it does see.

3481
03:03:03,280 --> 03:03:05,280
Oh, piss off. Right.

3482
03:03:05,280 --> 03:03:07,280
Go away. I don't...

3483
03:03:09,280 --> 03:03:11,280
Okay.

3484
03:03:11,280 --> 03:03:13,280
Because you don't understand something,

3485
03:03:13,280 --> 03:03:15,280
it doesn't mean that it cannot be

3486
03:03:15,280 --> 03:03:17,280
the fact of life, okay?

3487
03:03:17,280 --> 03:03:19,280
Because you don't understand just fucking

3488
03:03:19,280 --> 03:03:21,280
ram it. Just keep ramming it.

3489
03:03:21,280 --> 03:03:23,280
Make it someone else's problem.

3490
03:03:23,280 --> 03:03:25,280
Just keep ramming it.

3491
03:03:25,280 --> 03:03:27,280
Solution will come to me.

3492
03:03:27,280 --> 03:03:29,280
Ha ha ha ha.

3493
03:03:29,280 --> 03:03:31,280
As long as the pillars

3494
03:03:31,280 --> 03:03:33,280
are where they are meant to be,

3495
03:03:33,280 --> 03:03:35,280
I think I can hate

3496
03:03:35,280 --> 03:03:37,280
that there's something wrong with this fucking window.

3497
03:03:37,280 --> 03:03:39,280
If the pillars

3498
03:03:39,280 --> 03:03:41,280
are where they're meant to be,

3499
03:03:41,280 --> 03:03:43,280
men men men men men.

3500
03:03:43,280 --> 03:03:45,280
If the pillars are where they're meant to be,

3501
03:03:47,280 --> 03:03:49,280
copy them.

3502
03:03:49,280 --> 03:03:51,280
Oh.

3503
03:03:51,280 --> 03:03:53,280
You know what would be really fun,

3504
03:03:53,280 --> 03:03:55,280
mommy?

3505
03:03:55,280 --> 03:03:59,280
Getting a modern LEGO set so we can build along with you?

3506
03:03:59,280 --> 03:04:00,780
No, cause you'll all be like,

3507
03:04:00,780 --> 03:04:02,780
Mummy, I've been waiting five minutes.

3508
03:04:02,780 --> 03:04:04,780
Stop it.

3509
03:04:04,780 --> 03:04:06,280
MB Bucket?

3510
03:04:06,280 --> 03:04:07,780
Thank you for becoming a member,

3511
03:04:07,780 --> 03:04:09,780
I'm so sorry I missed your notification.

3512
03:04:09,780 --> 03:04:12,280
Um, Mummy's having a mental breakdown,

3513
03:04:12,280 --> 03:04:13,280
I'll wear a bit of plastic.

3514
03:04:13,280 --> 03:04:14,780
I'm sorry, son.

3515
03:04:14,780 --> 03:04:16,780
I'm sorry, son.

3516
03:04:18,280 --> 03:04:19,780
Remove one of the arches,

3517
03:04:19,780 --> 03:04:23,280
then slide in the transparent part in the groove,

3518
03:04:23,280 --> 03:04:24,780
in the remaining arch,

3519
03:04:24,780 --> 03:04:27,780
then put back the other arch between the arches.

3520
03:04:29,280 --> 03:04:31,280
What the fuck are you on about?

3521
03:04:31,280 --> 03:04:32,780
Thank you for the...

3522
03:04:32,780 --> 03:04:34,780
What are you on about?

3523
03:04:34,780 --> 03:04:36,780
Slade what?

3524
03:04:36,780 --> 03:04:38,780
My fucking painters?

3525
03:04:41,780 --> 03:04:43,280
Sl- an arch?

3526
03:04:43,280 --> 03:04:44,280
Right, okay.

3527
03:04:44,280 --> 03:04:45,780
Hold on.

3528
03:04:45,780 --> 03:04:48,280
So we're calling this sand bit a pillar.

3529
03:04:48,280 --> 03:04:49,280
Right?

3530
03:04:49,280 --> 03:04:51,280
Right?

3531
03:04:51,280 --> 03:04:53,780
So when you say remove an arch,

3532
03:04:53,780 --> 03:04:56,280
you mean one of these?

3533
03:04:56,280 --> 03:04:58,780
The sixth window arch?

3534
03:04:58,780 --> 03:05:00,280
Or is this wrong?

3535
03:05:00,280 --> 03:05:02,280
That's not the arch.

3536
03:05:08,780 --> 03:05:11,280
This is not what you mean.

3537
03:05:11,280 --> 03:05:12,280
No, not that one.

3538
03:05:12,280 --> 03:05:14,280
Okay, so you mean the sand pillars?

3539
03:05:14,280 --> 03:05:16,280
Okay, yes.

3540
03:05:18,780 --> 03:05:20,280
Is the grass not?

3541
03:05:21,780 --> 03:05:23,780
Hold on, the grass isn't right.

3542
03:05:27,780 --> 03:05:28,780
Okay.

3543
03:05:29,780 --> 03:05:30,780
The pillar.

3544
03:05:30,780 --> 03:05:32,280
Remove one of the pillars.

3545
03:05:32,280 --> 03:05:34,780
One pillar has been removed.

3546
03:05:34,780 --> 03:05:36,780
I said one pillar has been removed.

3547
03:05:36,780 --> 03:05:37,780
Okay.

3548
03:05:37,780 --> 03:05:38,780
Let me read that, don't know.

3549
03:05:38,780 --> 03:05:40,780
Stoney, remove one of the arches,

3550
03:05:40,780 --> 03:05:44,780
then slide in the transparent part

3551
03:05:44,780 --> 03:05:48,780
in the groove,

3552
03:05:48,780 --> 03:05:51,280
in the remaining arch.

3553
03:05:53,780 --> 03:05:56,280
What does that mean?

3554
03:05:56,280 --> 03:06:00,280
I'm gonna have to start fucking discord calling yous.

3555
03:06:02,280 --> 03:06:06,280
Then slide in the transparent part.

3556
03:06:06,280 --> 03:06:09,280
Oh, I can't.

3557
03:06:09,280 --> 03:06:12,280
Slade in the transparent part.

3558
03:06:12,280 --> 03:06:13,280
Where?

3559
03:06:13,280 --> 03:06:16,280
Where would I slide it in?

3560
03:06:16,280 --> 03:06:18,280
I was already in.

3561
03:06:19,280 --> 03:06:22,280
It was already in.

3562
03:06:24,280 --> 03:06:28,280
Remove the arch first to see.

3563
03:06:28,280 --> 03:06:34,280
So now I'm removing the arches, the curvy part, mommy.

3564
03:06:34,280 --> 03:06:36,280
Okay, so it's not the pillars, right?

3565
03:06:36,280 --> 03:06:38,280
I'm taking the pillars out.

3566
03:06:38,280 --> 03:06:39,280
Fuck you.

3567
03:06:39,280 --> 03:06:42,280
Remove one of the arches.

3568
03:06:44,280 --> 03:06:45,280
Okay.

3569
03:06:45,280 --> 03:06:47,280
Then what?

3570
03:06:47,280 --> 03:06:50,780
Then, Stoney, remove one of the arches,

3571
03:06:50,780 --> 03:06:53,780
then slide in the transparent part

3572
03:06:53,780 --> 03:06:56,780
in the groove of the remaining arch.

3573
03:07:02,780 --> 03:07:05,780
Like, there's no end.

3574
03:07:05,780 --> 03:07:07,780
Oh, the whole thing.

3575
03:07:07,780 --> 03:07:12,780
Oh, the whole thing.

3576
03:07:12,780 --> 03:07:14,780
Like that.

3577
03:07:15,280 --> 03:07:18,280
Oh, the thing goes inside it.

3578
03:07:20,280 --> 03:07:22,280
Oh, my God.

3579
03:07:22,280 --> 03:07:26,280
Like, the whole thing goes inside it.

3580
03:07:26,280 --> 03:07:28,280
We got there.

3581
03:07:28,280 --> 03:07:31,280
Right, okay, back to building D.

3582
03:07:31,280 --> 03:07:33,280
I love building Legos.

3583
03:07:33,280 --> 03:07:35,280
Legos are so fun.

3584
03:07:35,280 --> 03:07:37,280
I love building Legos.

3585
03:07:39,280 --> 03:07:43,280
Okay, let me just fix the grass.

3586
03:07:43,280 --> 03:07:45,280
I got it!

3587
03:07:45,280 --> 03:07:47,280
Okay, let's...

3588
03:07:49,280 --> 03:07:51,280
Let's just come in full, right?

3589
03:07:51,280 --> 03:07:53,280
Okay, back to you.

3590
03:07:53,280 --> 03:07:55,780
Now that we have a frame and everything,

3591
03:07:55,780 --> 03:07:57,780
I can adjust it again.

3592
03:07:57,780 --> 03:07:59,280
Okay.

3593
03:07:59,280 --> 03:08:02,280
We put that there, and then we put the pillars.

3594
03:08:03,280 --> 03:08:05,280
We got the pillar there.

3595
03:08:06,280 --> 03:08:13,280
Okay, then I need two skinny green ones.

3596
03:08:13,280 --> 03:08:15,280
I have a long one, so I'm not...

3597
03:08:15,280 --> 03:08:17,280
Two skinny green ones.

3598
03:08:17,280 --> 03:08:19,280
Two skinny green ones.

3599
03:08:19,280 --> 03:08:21,280
Two skinny green ones.

3600
03:08:21,280 --> 03:08:23,280
Okay.

3601
03:08:25,280 --> 03:08:29,280
And then they go on top,

3602
03:08:29,280 --> 03:08:32,280
around this brown paint part.

3603
03:08:32,280 --> 03:08:34,280
You still see? You can.

3604
03:08:34,280 --> 03:08:36,280
So they go...

3605
03:08:36,280 --> 03:08:38,280
A very nice gay dork.

3606
03:08:38,280 --> 03:08:40,280
He dated me.

3607
03:08:40,280 --> 03:08:42,280
He gave me a painted...

3608
03:08:42,280 --> 03:08:44,280
A painted dork.

3609
03:08:48,280 --> 03:08:52,280
Oh, it appears I'm experiencing what is known as severe shoulder pain.

3610
03:08:52,280 --> 03:08:54,280
I think they're not with us.

3611
03:08:54,280 --> 03:08:56,280
Okay.

3612
03:08:56,280 --> 03:08:58,280
Wait, why aren't you going in?

3613
03:09:00,280 --> 03:09:02,280
What's holding you back?

3614
03:09:02,280 --> 03:09:04,280
It's going to...

3615
03:09:06,280 --> 03:09:08,280
Excuse me?

3616
03:09:18,280 --> 03:09:20,280
There's a window facing the wrong way.

3617
03:09:26,280 --> 03:09:28,280
Hold on.

3618
03:09:28,280 --> 03:09:30,280
Don't worry, I just need to turn it.

3619
03:09:32,280 --> 03:09:34,280
Okay.

3620
03:09:42,280 --> 03:09:44,280
And then like this.

3621
03:09:44,280 --> 03:09:46,280
Ah, so there's a man.

3622
03:09:46,280 --> 03:09:48,280
I am so smart.

3623
03:09:48,280 --> 03:09:50,280
It's in marking.

3624
03:09:50,280 --> 03:09:52,280
I am so smart.

3625
03:09:52,280 --> 03:09:54,280
In marking.

3626
03:09:54,280 --> 03:09:56,280
Okay, we did this.

3627
03:09:56,280 --> 03:09:58,280
We are finally out of that section.

3628
03:09:58,280 --> 03:10:00,280
Never again do we have to revisit that section.

3629
03:10:00,280 --> 03:10:03,280
Okay, we need two archways which are in your dog bowl.

3630
03:10:03,280 --> 03:10:05,280
Like so.

3631
03:10:05,280 --> 03:10:07,280
I'm going to burp.

3632
03:10:07,280 --> 03:10:09,280
That's a terrible burp.

3633
03:10:09,280 --> 03:10:11,280
Hold on, hydration check.

3634
03:10:11,280 --> 03:10:13,280
I'm going to rotate my shoulder a little bit.

3635
03:10:13,280 --> 03:10:15,280
The top of the brown window needs to be...

3636
03:10:15,280 --> 03:10:17,280
How did you spell that?

3637
03:10:17,280 --> 03:10:19,280
How did you spell that?

3638
03:10:19,280 --> 03:10:21,280
My little eyeball can't do it and I'm right in front of it.

3639
03:10:24,280 --> 03:10:28,280
You forgot to place the transparent piece in the window.

3640
03:10:28,280 --> 03:10:30,280
Okay.

3641
03:10:30,280 --> 03:10:32,280
This?

3642
03:10:32,280 --> 03:10:34,280
Oh Jesus, what the fuck was that?

3643
03:10:34,280 --> 03:10:36,280
I think it was my microphone.

3644
03:10:36,280 --> 03:10:38,280
Sorry, I scared myself.

3645
03:10:40,280 --> 03:10:42,280
Okay, the transparent part in the window.

3646
03:10:42,280 --> 03:10:44,280
I can do that.

3647
03:10:44,280 --> 03:10:46,280
Ignore that the grass keeps coming off it's me.

3648
03:10:50,280 --> 03:10:52,280
Hold on.

3649
03:10:52,280 --> 03:10:54,280
I need to be like...

3650
03:10:54,280 --> 03:10:56,280
Can you go in here?

3651
03:10:58,280 --> 03:11:00,280
Okay.

3652
03:11:08,280 --> 03:11:10,280
I can't figure that when I...

3653
03:11:10,280 --> 03:11:12,280
Wait, what was the instructions?

3654
03:11:18,280 --> 03:11:20,280
Twist it in.

3655
03:11:20,280 --> 03:11:22,280
Twist it in.

3656
03:11:22,280 --> 03:11:24,280
Twist it in.

3657
03:11:24,280 --> 03:11:26,280
Twist it in.

3658
03:11:27,280 --> 03:11:29,280
Release me!

3659
03:11:29,280 --> 03:11:31,280
Twist it in.

3660
03:11:34,280 --> 03:11:37,280
Oh, well, I didn't have to twist that much.

3661
03:11:37,280 --> 03:11:41,280
Okay, let's pop on the grass again for the eighth time.

3662
03:11:44,280 --> 03:11:48,280
As long as it's still together, it's really all I care about.

3663
03:11:48,280 --> 03:11:51,280
I'm just going to press down to make sure nothing's

3664
03:11:51,280 --> 03:11:54,280
planning on flying away at this point in time.

3665
03:11:55,280 --> 03:11:57,280
I've been...

3666
03:11:58,280 --> 03:12:00,280
Wait, did I even take a picture?

3667
03:12:00,280 --> 03:12:02,280
I will be so much better.

3668
03:12:02,280 --> 03:12:04,280
You worked so hard and so did Admiral.

3669
03:12:04,280 --> 03:12:06,280
Please make sure you get enough rest and be healthy.

3670
03:12:06,280 --> 03:12:08,280
Yes, this week is definitely a rest week for me.

3671
03:12:08,280 --> 03:12:10,280
Um...

3672
03:12:10,280 --> 03:12:12,280
I hope you don't mind the shorter streams.

3673
03:12:12,280 --> 03:12:14,280
I feel like really new when I do them.

3674
03:12:14,280 --> 03:12:16,280
MP Bucket, thank you for the extended membership!

3675
03:12:16,280 --> 03:12:18,280
Peace out!

3676
03:12:18,280 --> 03:12:20,280
Um...

3677
03:12:20,280 --> 03:12:22,280
The green pieces taste like green apple.

3678
03:12:22,280 --> 03:12:23,280
Please do not eat.

3679
03:12:23,280 --> 03:12:24,280
Quick, eat a piece.

3680
03:12:24,280 --> 03:12:25,280
Wait, why are you eating a piece?

3681
03:12:25,280 --> 03:12:27,280
Because I'm looking away.

3682
03:12:28,280 --> 03:12:29,280
Um...

3683
03:12:29,280 --> 03:12:31,280
Can I have one of the spare pieces?

3684
03:12:31,280 --> 03:12:32,280
I'm hungry.

3685
03:12:32,280 --> 03:12:34,280
Or do you need food?

3686
03:12:35,280 --> 03:12:36,280
I have...

3687
03:12:36,280 --> 03:12:38,280
Unironically, I have chicken tendies.

3688
03:12:38,280 --> 03:12:40,280
They're like the best thing ever here.

3689
03:12:41,280 --> 03:12:42,280
Eh, right.

3690
03:12:42,280 --> 03:12:43,280
Okay.

3691
03:12:43,280 --> 03:12:48,280
Add these tellers to these onto the teller.

3692
03:12:49,280 --> 03:12:51,280
Oh, bit wobbly.

3693
03:12:51,280 --> 03:12:52,280
Bit wobbly, yeah?

3694
03:12:52,280 --> 03:12:53,280
Bit wobbly, nobly.

3695
03:12:53,280 --> 03:12:55,280
Like a tiny, whiny biscuit.

3696
03:12:55,280 --> 03:12:56,280
Twist it.

3697
03:12:56,280 --> 03:12:57,280
Like it.

3698
03:12:57,280 --> 03:12:58,280
Turn it.

3699
03:12:58,280 --> 03:12:59,280
Bop it.

3700
03:12:59,280 --> 03:13:00,280
Q.

3701
03:13:00,280 --> 03:13:01,280
Q.

3702
03:13:01,280 --> 03:13:02,280
Q.

3703
03:13:03,280 --> 03:13:06,280
Thank you, the beauty lord, for the knyup.

3704
03:13:07,280 --> 03:13:09,280
Okay, add those pieces.

3705
03:13:09,280 --> 03:13:10,280
Up next.

3706
03:13:10,280 --> 03:13:15,280
One by three green brick.

3707
03:13:15,280 --> 03:13:17,280
But you'll need two of them.

3708
03:13:17,280 --> 03:13:18,280
Player.

3709
03:13:18,280 --> 03:13:20,280
Add them where?

3710
03:13:21,280 --> 03:13:22,280
Here.

3711
03:13:22,280 --> 03:13:23,280
E.T.

3712
03:13:23,280 --> 03:13:26,280
It only attaches to this little bit there,

3713
03:13:26,280 --> 03:13:29,280
which isn't really doing it for me.

3714
03:13:29,280 --> 03:13:30,280
Mm-hmm.

3715
03:13:30,280 --> 03:13:31,280
Okay, fine.

3716
03:13:31,280 --> 03:13:33,280
We've added it.

3717
03:13:33,280 --> 03:13:34,280
Step 67.

3718
03:13:34,280 --> 03:13:35,280
Do two.

3719
03:13:35,280 --> 03:13:36,280
Two.

3720
03:13:36,280 --> 03:13:37,280
Two.

3721
03:13:37,280 --> 03:13:38,280
Two.

3722
03:13:38,280 --> 03:13:39,280
Two.

3723
03:13:39,280 --> 03:13:40,280
Two.

3724
03:13:40,280 --> 03:13:41,280
Two.

3725
03:13:41,280 --> 03:13:42,280
Two.

3726
03:13:42,280 --> 03:13:43,280
Two.

3727
03:13:43,280 --> 03:13:44,280
Two.

3728
03:13:44,280 --> 03:13:45,280
Two.

3729
03:13:45,280 --> 03:13:46,280
Two.

3730
03:13:46,280 --> 03:13:47,280
Two.

3731
03:13:47,280 --> 03:13:48,280
Two.

3732
03:13:48,280 --> 03:13:49,280
Two.

3733
03:13:49,280 --> 03:13:50,280
Two.

3734
03:13:50,280 --> 03:13:51,280
Two.

3735
03:13:51,280 --> 03:13:52,280
Half.

3736
03:13:52,280 --> 03:13:54,280
I don't know, six by one.

3737
03:13:54,280 --> 03:13:56,280
It's not six by one, is it?

3738
03:13:56,280 --> 03:13:58,280
Because it's like a fake piece.

3739
03:13:58,280 --> 03:13:59,280
One of them.

3740
03:13:59,280 --> 03:14:03,280
And then get another one that looks the exact same.

3741
03:14:03,280 --> 03:14:04,280
Okay.

3742
03:14:04,280 --> 03:14:06,280
Now, whoa.

3743
03:14:06,280 --> 03:14:07,280
Sorry.

3744
03:14:07,280 --> 03:14:09,280
I just realized that bull is really close to the microphone.

3745
03:14:09,280 --> 03:14:12,280
It's probably really light in your ear.

3746
03:14:12,280 --> 03:14:15,280
I wonder how much energy Stony would have in an actual night in a five.

3747
03:14:15,280 --> 03:14:16,280
I used to be a waitress.

3748
03:14:16,280 --> 03:14:18,280
I used to work in a care home.

3749
03:14:18,280 --> 03:14:19,280
Those were 12 hours shifts.

3750
03:14:19,280 --> 03:14:22,280
Those were very difficult, difficult, and difficult.

3751
03:14:22,280 --> 03:14:28,280
You can bang these two and stick them at the top of the window.

3752
03:14:28,280 --> 03:14:35,280
I, for the lack of better words, was just a zombie when I did the normal nine to five.

3753
03:14:35,280 --> 03:14:38,280
Like, I am tired after stream.

3754
03:14:38,280 --> 03:14:39,280
Like, I do lie down.

3755
03:14:39,280 --> 03:14:44,280
I have a nap and then like I'll deal with like whatever the girls are asking for me.

3756
03:14:44,280 --> 03:14:47,280
Like, after I've had a lie down because I'm just tanning.

3757
03:14:47,280 --> 03:14:50,280
Like, is it decompressors or?

3758
03:14:50,280 --> 03:15:00,280
Because I like being quiet after stream because I'm very loud and not annoying loud though,

3759
03:15:00,280 --> 03:15:07,280
but just loud in terms of like, I don't normally, I don't know, it's not normally just comedy.

3760
03:15:07,280 --> 03:15:13,280
I don't normally like talk with much or do this thing, you know.

3761
03:15:13,280 --> 03:15:17,280
So I do enjoy being a little bit quiet.

3762
03:15:17,280 --> 03:15:18,280
Wait, what?

3763
03:15:24,280 --> 03:15:25,280
Hold on.

3764
03:15:25,280 --> 03:15:27,280
Something's not good.

3765
03:15:30,280 --> 03:15:32,280
What was that?

3766
03:15:33,280 --> 03:15:36,280
And then a cube above the doorway.

3767
03:15:37,280 --> 03:15:39,280
And then one this one.

3768
03:15:39,280 --> 03:15:40,280
Must be.

3769
03:15:41,280 --> 03:15:43,280
If it fits, I sits.

3770
03:15:46,280 --> 03:15:49,280
You're often swapped between super quiet and super loud.

3771
03:15:49,280 --> 03:15:52,280
Basically, I get really excited when I get to be with you.

3772
03:15:54,280 --> 03:16:00,280
Which makes me like super happy and like, oh my god, basically.

3773
03:16:00,280 --> 03:16:08,280
But once stream is over, like I normally go get Gimli and Vigo and I let them outside

3774
03:16:08,280 --> 03:16:12,280
and they need the toilet and if they need more food, I'll give them more.

3775
03:16:12,280 --> 03:16:20,280
And then I lie down in my bed and I do what I call my TikTok green rotine.

3776
03:16:20,280 --> 03:16:25,280
And it's just like quiet, like I just, no words, no nothing.

3777
03:16:25,280 --> 03:16:27,280
Sorry, I just really can't see that.

3778
03:16:27,280 --> 03:16:28,280
Sorry, again, it's okay.

3779
03:16:28,280 --> 03:16:31,280
So we've now flattened this window.

3780
03:16:32,280 --> 03:16:37,280
Typical Aussie's girlfriend talks a lot with boyfriend there and then doesn't talk when he's not there.

3781
03:16:37,280 --> 03:16:39,280
Honestly, really fun, honestly.

3782
03:16:39,280 --> 03:16:42,280
I'm just like, okay, well, now what?

3783
03:16:42,280 --> 03:16:47,280
And then once I've had enough TikTok time, like my brain will just tell me enough.

3784
03:16:47,280 --> 03:16:48,280
It's like, okay, I've had enough.

3785
03:16:48,280 --> 03:16:52,280
And then I'll be like, right, okay, what am I doing for food?

3786
03:16:52,280 --> 03:16:57,280
And most likely it's take away because you don't have time to be doing too much.

3787
03:16:57,280 --> 03:16:58,280
Right, what?

3788
03:16:58,280 --> 03:16:59,280
Beam.

3789
03:17:02,280 --> 03:17:07,280
It says I need three named beans.

3790
03:17:07,280 --> 03:17:15,280
That's two, four, six, eight, and then nine.

3791
03:17:15,280 --> 03:17:18,280
And then I need three.

3792
03:17:18,280 --> 03:17:24,280
Oh, I think I thought one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

3793
03:17:24,280 --> 03:17:26,280
And then I need three poopy studs.

3794
03:17:26,280 --> 03:17:30,280
One, two.

3795
03:17:30,280 --> 03:17:33,280
And then a third poopy stud.

3796
03:17:33,280 --> 03:17:34,280
Okay.

3797
03:17:34,280 --> 03:17:36,280
What do I do?

3798
03:17:36,280 --> 03:17:38,280
Oh, and I need three arches.

3799
03:17:38,280 --> 03:17:39,280
Okay.

3800
03:17:39,280 --> 03:17:41,280
And I'm like, use me.

3801
03:17:41,280 --> 03:17:45,280
Some of us are busy rambling.

3802
03:17:45,280 --> 03:17:47,280
Mama, you need to eat healthy.

3803
03:17:47,280 --> 03:17:49,280
Cooked meals.

3804
03:17:49,280 --> 03:17:59,280
I did well making that soup, but just, I don't feel like putting that in.

3805
03:17:59,280 --> 03:18:01,280
I don't feel like putting effort.

3806
03:18:01,280 --> 03:18:05,280
Not just, not, right, before anyone dooms when I say this.

3807
03:18:05,280 --> 03:18:10,280
Not to like be fucking dramatic or anything, but like, I want to put in effort for stream.

3808
03:18:10,280 --> 03:18:11,280
I want to put in effort for you.

3809
03:18:11,280 --> 03:18:15,280
I want to have a good time with you and all that.

3810
03:18:15,280 --> 03:18:22,280
What, I didn't, like, as soon as I finish stream, I'm just like, that's the best.

3811
03:18:22,280 --> 03:18:25,280
I just perish after stream.

3812
03:18:25,280 --> 03:18:28,280
Where did the third one come in?

3813
03:18:28,280 --> 03:18:31,280
I'm just making a third one.

3814
03:18:31,280 --> 03:18:33,280
Of the truth.

3815
03:18:33,280 --> 03:18:35,280
Of the truth.

3816
03:18:35,280 --> 03:18:40,280
And like, I made that soup and then I got the chicken to make a soup round two.

3817
03:18:40,280 --> 03:18:42,280
And I just never made that.

3818
03:18:42,280 --> 03:18:44,280
And then those veggies ended up getting me.

3819
03:18:44,280 --> 03:18:45,280
And then I felt bad.

3820
03:18:45,280 --> 03:18:48,280
I put them out to the salute.

3821
03:18:48,280 --> 03:18:53,280
Learning as many recipes.

3822
03:18:53,280 --> 03:19:05,280
I think, honestly, my solution is probably to go hell for leather and make frozen meals.

3823
03:19:05,280 --> 03:19:08,280
Like, you know how those folk do frozen meal food prep?

3824
03:19:08,280 --> 03:19:13,280
I saw a breakfast burrito one and I was like, I could probably last on that.

3825
03:19:13,280 --> 03:19:18,280
I used to eat fajitas every single day for a very, very long time.

3826
03:19:19,280 --> 03:19:22,280
Fajitas you can make in one pan.

3827
03:19:22,280 --> 03:19:26,280
And you microwave the tortillas.

3828
03:19:30,280 --> 03:19:32,280
Oh, that goes on.

3829
03:19:32,280 --> 03:19:38,280
Well, I'm actually glad I found that third piece because, yeah, this is kind of more structural stuff that would have been

3830
03:19:38,280 --> 03:19:41,280
balanced then without the bottom.

3831
03:19:41,280 --> 03:19:43,280
Okay, we're putting...

3832
03:19:44,280 --> 03:19:46,280
My hand's getting sore.

3833
03:19:46,280 --> 03:19:48,280
I'm getting like pain in here.

3834
03:19:48,280 --> 03:19:50,280
Gimli, I heard that.

3835
03:19:52,280 --> 03:19:55,280
I think the background's coming together, though.

3836
03:19:55,280 --> 03:20:00,280
Like, actually, I could see myself role-playing in here so well.

3837
03:20:02,280 --> 03:20:03,280
Why he becomes golem?

3838
03:20:03,280 --> 03:20:04,280
I don't know.

3839
03:20:04,280 --> 03:20:05,280
Don't question that.

3840
03:20:05,280 --> 03:20:06,280
Don't question that.

3841
03:20:06,280 --> 03:20:08,280
What?

3842
03:20:08,280 --> 03:20:10,280
What was I saying?

3843
03:20:10,280 --> 03:20:12,280
I forgot.

3844
03:20:12,280 --> 03:20:14,280
I'm looking for the...

3845
03:20:14,280 --> 03:20:17,280
I should have probably put a bit of background music in it.

3846
03:20:17,280 --> 03:20:20,280
You know what? How about you open up on YouTube?

3847
03:20:20,280 --> 03:20:24,280
Just put the Shire music on one hour loop.

3848
03:20:24,280 --> 03:20:27,280
And then that will come for you during this video.

3849
03:20:29,280 --> 03:20:30,280
Oh, Brian?

3850
03:20:36,280 --> 03:20:41,280
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

3851
03:20:41,280 --> 03:20:43,280
Pretty much it, some stream ends.

3852
03:20:43,280 --> 03:20:45,280
I'm just like, yep, quiet.

3853
03:20:45,280 --> 03:20:48,280
Rest well, those who sleep. Thank you for hanging in.

3854
03:20:48,280 --> 03:20:50,280
You'd volunteer to cook for me?

3855
03:20:50,280 --> 03:20:52,280
Yeah, you make me spaghetti.

3856
03:20:52,280 --> 03:20:55,280
My mum made me spaghetti when I first moved out.

3857
03:20:55,280 --> 03:21:04,280
She would get annoyed at me because every time I saw her, she'd be like,

3858
03:21:04,280 --> 03:21:06,280
I'm losing weight, stunning.

3859
03:21:06,280 --> 03:21:09,280
And I'd be non-purpose.

3860
03:21:09,280 --> 03:21:13,280
I just couldn't be asking anything for myself.

3861
03:21:13,280 --> 03:21:17,280
I just don't care. I don't care.

3862
03:21:17,280 --> 03:21:22,280
But I care about making you happy and hanging out.

3863
03:21:22,280 --> 03:21:26,280
Shit, I got fucking spoiled to this Lego set.

3864
03:21:26,280 --> 03:21:30,280
If you don't know the lore, I was in a membership stream

3865
03:21:30,280 --> 03:21:33,280
and I was talking about Lego or something and I looked up the set.

3866
03:21:33,280 --> 03:21:35,280
I was like, oh, it's $500.

3867
03:21:35,280 --> 03:21:37,280
I'm not going to spend it on myself.

3868
03:21:37,280 --> 03:21:41,280
An anonymous or anon, yeah, I guess anon.

3869
03:21:41,280 --> 03:21:44,280
Literally just gave them money over and I'm like, what the fuck?

3870
03:21:44,280 --> 03:21:46,280
I'm like, yeah, damn.

3871
03:21:48,280 --> 03:21:56,280
I don't deserve this, but it's very nice though.

3872
03:21:56,280 --> 03:21:58,280
This is very very nice.

3873
03:21:58,280 --> 03:22:02,280
I'm sorry if I sound tired or like, I promise you I'm not bored.

3874
03:22:02,280 --> 03:22:04,280
Yeah, I'm not bored.

3875
03:22:04,280 --> 03:22:06,280
I apologize if I sound tired.

3876
03:22:06,280 --> 03:22:11,280
And that is because, oh, don't do this to me now.

3877
03:22:14,280 --> 03:22:16,280
Don't do this to me now.

3878
03:22:17,280 --> 03:22:19,280
I don't think it's here.

3879
03:22:21,280 --> 03:22:23,280
You deserve it, mommy.

3880
03:22:24,280 --> 03:22:27,280
You deserve the nice stuff in life too.

3881
03:22:27,280 --> 03:22:29,280
You just don't give yourself that one.

3882
03:22:29,280 --> 03:22:31,280
I don't know why.

3883
03:22:31,280 --> 03:22:35,280
I don't know why you don't think you deserve the nice things.

3884
03:22:40,280 --> 03:22:42,280
Here's a missing piece.

3885
03:22:44,280 --> 03:22:46,280
Here's a missing piece.

3886
03:22:46,280 --> 03:22:48,280
You're fucking bam.

3887
03:22:55,280 --> 03:22:58,280
Can I hide that I have a missing piece of question?

3888
03:22:58,280 --> 03:23:00,280
It's a long piece.

3889
03:23:01,280 --> 03:23:03,280
A square.

3890
03:23:12,280 --> 03:23:16,280
I think there's a one tiny missing piece, but thankfully.

3891
03:23:16,280 --> 03:23:18,280
Thankfully, each no-

3892
03:23:18,280 --> 03:23:20,280
Are you squinting me right now?

3893
03:23:20,280 --> 03:23:22,280
Because I think I can hate that.

3894
03:23:23,280 --> 03:23:25,280
Right.

3895
03:23:31,280 --> 03:23:37,280
Is extroverts need two hours with people part of a mono introvert too?

3896
03:23:38,280 --> 03:23:40,280
I don't know.

3897
03:23:41,280 --> 03:23:42,280
It's not.

3898
03:23:42,280 --> 03:23:44,280
I suppose would it be?

3899
03:23:44,280 --> 03:23:46,280
Would it be anything else?

3900
03:23:47,280 --> 03:23:49,280
More like a pair of hair.

3901
03:23:53,280 --> 03:23:55,280
But I'm more serious now.

3902
03:23:56,280 --> 03:24:00,280
Thank you for the tip of the lucky person.

3903
03:24:01,280 --> 03:24:03,280
An anon, right?

3904
03:24:05,280 --> 03:24:09,280
Maybe involve us into your cooking if that gives you energy to cook.

3905
03:24:09,280 --> 03:24:11,280
So I'm doing a bacon stream next month.

3906
03:24:11,280 --> 03:24:13,280
I'll literally just spoil on it.

3907
03:24:14,280 --> 03:24:17,280
I'm going to see if I can think of unity stuff to do.

3908
03:24:17,280 --> 03:24:19,280
I've got two unity plans coming up.

3909
03:24:20,280 --> 03:24:22,280
I only have one of these.

3910
03:24:24,280 --> 03:24:29,280
I'd rather leave it out if it's going to stand out with a suit.

3911
03:24:32,280 --> 03:24:34,280
Nothing is falling out.

3912
03:24:37,280 --> 03:24:39,280
Wait, why are we crooked?

3913
03:24:39,280 --> 03:24:41,280
Oh right, because of my terrible jokes.

3914
03:24:41,280 --> 03:24:43,280
I was like, excuse you.

3915
03:24:44,280 --> 03:24:48,280
There's not a flat green piece in your dog bowl.

3916
03:24:48,280 --> 03:24:50,280
And there's not a...

3917
03:24:50,280 --> 03:24:52,280
Oh no, idiot.

3918
03:24:55,280 --> 03:24:57,280
I'm going to leave it.

3919
03:24:58,280 --> 03:25:00,280
I'm going to leave it out.

3920
03:25:00,280 --> 03:25:03,280
So it looks like it's supposed to be like that.

3921
03:25:04,280 --> 03:25:08,280
Okay, time for some physics engine stuff that I never comprehend.

3922
03:25:08,280 --> 03:25:10,280
Grab the door, got it.

3923
03:25:11,280 --> 03:25:15,280
Two black hinges and a sandstone.

3924
03:25:19,280 --> 03:25:21,280
I'm going to get some furniture that I would buy now.

3925
03:25:21,280 --> 03:25:23,280
Thank you, Anon, for the tip.

3926
03:25:24,280 --> 03:25:26,280
There's a small green in the bowl.

3927
03:25:26,280 --> 03:25:29,280
No, it's asking for a flat green.

3928
03:25:30,280 --> 03:25:32,280
There's only one.

3929
03:25:32,280 --> 03:25:35,280
These are too slow. These have two knobs on them.

3930
03:25:38,280 --> 03:25:40,280
Then you can't wait it is.

3931
03:25:42,280 --> 03:25:44,280
Wait, wait.

3932
03:25:48,280 --> 03:25:50,280
I think I'm being trolled, right?

3933
03:25:51,280 --> 03:25:53,280
It says sandstone.

3934
03:25:53,280 --> 03:25:55,280
Door.

3935
03:25:55,280 --> 03:25:56,280
And then...

3936
03:25:56,280 --> 03:25:57,280
No, one knob.

3937
03:25:57,280 --> 03:25:58,280
Okay, I'm not being trolled.

3938
03:25:58,280 --> 03:26:01,280
I take it back. I'm sorry. I'm just very doom and gloom right now.

3939
03:26:01,280 --> 03:26:02,280
So...

3940
03:26:03,280 --> 03:26:06,280
Right, one. Get the pieces together.

3941
03:26:06,280 --> 03:26:08,280
Sandstone.

3942
03:26:08,280 --> 03:26:10,280
One goes that way.

3943
03:26:11,280 --> 03:26:12,280
There's this way.

3944
03:26:12,280 --> 03:26:13,280
Right.

3945
03:26:16,280 --> 03:26:17,280
Two.

3946
03:26:20,280 --> 03:26:24,280
Attractive women cooking McMailman go-brew.

3947
03:26:24,280 --> 03:26:25,280
Wait.

3948
03:26:25,280 --> 03:26:27,280
What did I just see there?

3949
03:26:28,280 --> 03:26:32,280
Attractive women cooking makes male main brain go-brew.

3950
03:26:32,280 --> 03:26:35,280
Wait, I need to go online. Good night.

3951
03:26:35,280 --> 03:26:37,280
We've had a good run.

3952
03:26:37,280 --> 03:26:39,280
Right, and then two.

3953
03:26:40,280 --> 03:26:42,280
Sandstone.

3954
03:26:43,280 --> 03:26:45,280
Go up and down there.

3955
03:26:47,280 --> 03:26:52,280
I think I'm definitely going to run that fast with this thing.

3956
03:26:52,280 --> 03:26:54,280
Right, I'm being trolled.

3957
03:26:54,280 --> 03:26:56,280
There's another missing piece.

3958
03:26:59,280 --> 03:27:03,280
See here? This one doesn't have any knobbly wobbly biscuits on it.

3959
03:27:04,280 --> 03:27:07,280
Oh, because it's on the top of this fucking thing.

3960
03:27:07,280 --> 03:27:09,280
Excuse me.

3961
03:27:10,280 --> 03:27:12,280
I can't laugh.

3962
03:27:13,280 --> 03:27:15,280
I'm not allowed to.

3963
03:27:15,280 --> 03:27:17,280
Can you just come up?

3964
03:27:17,280 --> 03:27:19,280
Can you come up?

3965
03:27:20,280 --> 03:27:22,280
Can you come up?

3966
03:27:23,280 --> 03:27:25,280
Okay, okay, hold on.

3967
03:27:28,280 --> 03:27:30,280
Sorry.

3968
03:27:30,280 --> 03:27:32,280
There's a.

3969
03:27:32,280 --> 03:27:34,280
And one of the.

3970
03:27:34,280 --> 03:27:37,280
One of it was like a caption with the sound.

3971
03:27:37,280 --> 03:27:39,280
And it was like,

3972
03:27:39,280 --> 03:27:41,280
when I'm clutching up for my team,

3973
03:27:41,280 --> 03:27:43,280
but they don't know I'm a sandwich maker.

3974
03:27:43,280 --> 03:27:45,280
And it was like, no, no, I can't laugh.

3975
03:27:45,280 --> 03:27:47,280
And I was like, oh my God.

3976
03:27:47,280 --> 03:27:49,280
That's so true.

3977
03:27:49,280 --> 03:27:51,280
I don't like talking.

3978
03:27:51,280 --> 03:27:53,280
Unfortunately, I don't know.

3979
03:27:53,280 --> 03:27:56,280
I didn't have time for video games before I became a VTuber.

3980
03:27:56,280 --> 03:27:58,280
And now I get to experience all these.

3981
03:27:58,280 --> 03:28:00,280
I get to experience new games.

3982
03:28:00,280 --> 03:28:03,280
I get to play games with you guys.

3983
03:28:03,280 --> 03:28:05,280
It makes me really happy.

3984
03:28:05,280 --> 03:28:07,280
If you didn't know,

3985
03:28:07,280 --> 03:28:09,280
yeah, I kind of seem to,

3986
03:28:09,280 --> 03:28:11,280
you know,

3987
03:28:11,280 --> 03:28:13,280
you know,

3988
03:28:13,280 --> 03:28:15,280
you know,

3989
03:28:15,280 --> 03:28:17,280
I didn't know yet.

3990
03:28:17,280 --> 03:28:19,280
I kind of seem to enjoy doing things with you.

3991
03:28:19,280 --> 03:28:21,280
You know,

3992
03:28:21,280 --> 03:28:23,280
you love this set as a child.

3993
03:28:25,280 --> 03:28:27,280
Well, it was unbelievably hard.

3994
03:28:27,280 --> 03:28:29,280
Thank you.

3995
03:28:29,280 --> 03:28:31,280
I'm pinning that.

3996
03:28:31,280 --> 03:28:33,280
Hold on a minute.

3997
03:28:33,280 --> 03:28:35,280
I'm pinning that comment.

3998
03:28:35,280 --> 03:28:37,280
I'm pinning that fucking comment.

3999
03:28:37,280 --> 03:28:39,280
I need to.

4000
03:28:39,280 --> 03:28:41,280
I need to pin it.

4001
03:28:41,280 --> 03:28:43,280
You don't understand.

4002
03:28:43,280 --> 03:28:45,280
I need to fucking pin it.

4003
03:28:45,280 --> 03:28:47,280
Where's that comment?

4004
03:28:47,280 --> 03:28:49,280
It's unbelievably hard.

4005
03:28:49,280 --> 03:28:51,280
Thank you.

4006
03:28:51,280 --> 03:28:53,280
Someone who has came

4007
03:28:53,280 --> 03:28:55,280
and done this set before

4008
03:28:55,280 --> 03:28:57,280
proving that it's fucking hard.

4009
03:28:57,280 --> 03:28:59,280
You've done this set before

4010
03:28:59,280 --> 03:29:01,280
proving that it's fucking hard.

4011
03:29:01,280 --> 03:29:03,280
Is that me?

4012
03:29:03,280 --> 03:29:05,280
Oh, I was like,

4013
03:29:05,280 --> 03:29:07,280
why can't I hear something talking?

4014
03:29:07,280 --> 03:29:09,280
It's me.

4015
03:29:09,280 --> 03:29:11,280
Sorry, it's me.

4016
03:29:11,280 --> 03:29:13,280
Well, apparently my brain's capacity is

4017
03:29:13,280 --> 03:29:15,280
because this is the fucking area where you can

4018
03:29:15,280 --> 03:29:17,280
wrap it up.

4019
03:29:27,280 --> 03:29:29,280
Hold on.

4020
03:29:29,280 --> 03:29:31,280
I'm going to have another split

4021
03:29:31,280 --> 03:29:33,280
and see what happens next.

4022
03:29:37,280 --> 03:29:39,280
Wait, he said it went hard?

4023
03:29:39,280 --> 03:29:41,280
Oh, no.

4024
03:29:41,280 --> 03:29:43,280
Oh my god, I actually love this set.

4025
03:29:43,280 --> 03:29:45,280
Legos went unbelievably hard.

4026
03:29:45,280 --> 03:29:47,280
No.

4027
03:29:47,280 --> 03:29:49,280
Fuck off.

4028
03:29:49,280 --> 03:29:51,280
I'm pinning. Get out of here.

4029
03:29:51,280 --> 03:29:53,280
Get out of here. I don't want to read that.

4030
03:29:53,280 --> 03:29:55,280
You take the wrong message.

4031
03:29:55,280 --> 03:29:57,280
You get nothing.

4032
03:29:57,280 --> 03:29:59,280
Get out of here.

4033
03:29:59,280 --> 03:30:01,280
No.

4034
03:30:01,280 --> 03:30:03,280
Get out of here.

4035
03:30:03,280 --> 03:30:05,280
I was fucking validating.

4036
03:30:05,280 --> 03:30:07,280
Someone who's done the thing

4037
03:30:07,280 --> 03:30:09,280
and knows how unbelievably awkward

4038
03:30:09,280 --> 03:30:11,280
and hard it is for no reason.

4039
03:30:11,280 --> 03:30:13,280
Take that piece.

4040
03:30:13,280 --> 03:30:15,280
Take this piece. Right.

4041
03:30:15,280 --> 03:30:17,280
The brown and the black.

4042
03:30:17,280 --> 03:30:19,280
What do they do together?

4043
03:30:19,280 --> 03:30:21,280
The brown goes on the knob side.

4044
03:30:21,280 --> 03:30:23,280
The black

4045
03:30:23,280 --> 03:30:25,280
goes like this.

4046
03:30:25,280 --> 03:30:27,280
Okay.

4047
03:30:31,280 --> 03:30:33,280
Can you go in?

4048
03:30:33,280 --> 03:30:35,280
Okay, and then four.

4049
03:30:35,280 --> 03:30:37,280
I spent most of my life without pet folk.

4050
03:30:37,280 --> 03:30:39,280
The folk is going on.

4051
03:30:41,280 --> 03:30:43,280
If a girl made me food, I would cry.

4052
03:30:43,280 --> 03:30:45,280
I mean, shit, you want some cheesy puffs?

4053
03:30:45,280 --> 03:30:47,280
I can fucking

4054
03:30:47,280 --> 03:30:49,280
pop that shit up real quick.

4055
03:30:49,280 --> 03:30:51,280
What am I doing? It says door.

4056
03:30:51,280 --> 03:30:53,280
It just shows me a picture of it.

4057
03:30:53,280 --> 03:30:55,280
Turn that shit over and let me see

4058
03:30:55,280 --> 03:30:57,280
if I attach it. You already know what I'm going to...

4059
03:30:57,280 --> 03:30:59,280
Fuck it up.

4060
03:30:59,280 --> 03:31:01,280
You already know.

4061
03:31:01,280 --> 03:31:03,280
And I guess I just go for it.

4062
03:31:05,280 --> 03:31:07,280
Wait a minute.

4063
03:31:07,280 --> 03:31:09,280
Wait a minute.

4064
03:31:09,280 --> 03:31:11,280
I'm brain dead.

4065
03:31:11,280 --> 03:31:13,280
I can't do this.

4066
03:31:13,280 --> 03:31:15,280
Okay.

4067
03:31:15,280 --> 03:31:17,280
Yeah, that looks right.

4068
03:31:17,280 --> 03:31:19,280
Okay, then on the back.

4069
03:31:19,280 --> 03:31:21,280
Two black lanes.

4070
03:31:21,280 --> 03:31:23,280
Three blind nights.

4071
03:31:23,280 --> 03:31:25,280
Two black lanes.

4072
03:31:25,280 --> 03:31:27,280
What the fuck is this?

4073
03:31:27,280 --> 03:31:29,280
And to put them here.

4074
03:31:31,280 --> 03:31:33,280
Like that.

4075
03:31:33,280 --> 03:31:35,280
Why would that... What would that do?

4076
03:31:35,280 --> 03:31:37,280
Hmm? What would that do?

4077
03:31:39,280 --> 03:31:41,280
I'm scrounging for any bit of

4078
03:31:41,280 --> 03:31:43,280
validate. How dare you?

4079
03:31:43,280 --> 03:31:45,280
How dare you be so... How dare you tell the truth?

4080
03:31:45,280 --> 03:31:47,280
I've had enough out of you.

4081
03:31:47,280 --> 03:31:49,280
Silence.

4082
03:31:49,280 --> 03:31:51,280
Okay.

4083
03:31:51,280 --> 03:31:53,280
God, remember that

4084
03:31:53,280 --> 03:31:55,280
puff it went so viral?

4085
03:31:57,280 --> 03:31:59,280
Right, now what happens?

4086
03:31:59,280 --> 03:32:01,280
Turn it back over and put a gold

4087
03:32:01,280 --> 03:32:03,280
on the door.

4088
03:32:03,280 --> 03:32:05,280
I mean, that looks pretty golden to me.

4089
03:32:07,280 --> 03:32:09,280
Gold? Wait, what one?

4090
03:32:09,280 --> 03:32:11,280
There's a yellow yen.

4091
03:32:13,280 --> 03:32:15,280
I mean, I can always take it off.

4092
03:32:15,280 --> 03:32:17,280
It's not a big deal.

4093
03:32:17,280 --> 03:32:19,280
Oh, hold on.

4094
03:32:25,280 --> 03:32:27,280
Oh, come on.

4095
03:32:27,280 --> 03:32:29,280
It's squeezy?

4096
03:32:31,280 --> 03:32:33,280
Bro, how are

4097
03:32:33,280 --> 03:32:35,280
VTubers so relaxed doing this?

4098
03:32:35,280 --> 03:32:37,280
Ah, I'm getting angry.

4099
03:32:37,280 --> 03:32:39,280
I'm like enjoying it.

4100
03:32:39,280 --> 03:32:41,280
But excuse me?

4101
03:32:41,280 --> 03:32:43,280
Who?

4102
03:32:43,280 --> 03:32:45,280
Where did it go? It despawned.

4103
03:32:45,280 --> 03:32:47,280
Oh, there it is. I found it.

4104
03:32:47,280 --> 03:32:49,280
It's here.

4105
03:32:49,280 --> 03:32:51,280
How are VTubers like?

4106
03:32:51,280 --> 03:32:53,280
I just love building Legos.

4107
03:32:53,280 --> 03:32:55,280
Right, well...

4108
03:32:55,280 --> 03:32:57,280
I like making progress.

4109
03:32:57,280 --> 03:32:59,280
Why is there no progress?

4110
03:32:59,280 --> 03:33:01,280
How's it like, go in the...

4111
03:33:01,280 --> 03:33:03,280
Right, go fucking.

4112
03:33:03,280 --> 03:33:05,280
I'm putting the yellow knob one on.

4113
03:33:05,280 --> 03:33:07,280
Fuck you.

4114
03:33:07,280 --> 03:33:09,280
And before this is the correct one.

4115
03:33:09,280 --> 03:33:11,280
Oh my god, it's so pernickety because I'm a nail.

4116
03:33:11,280 --> 03:33:13,280
I'm going to leak this gen 2

4117
03:33:13,280 --> 03:33:15,280
fucking talents name.

4118
03:33:15,280 --> 03:33:17,280
Just to curse her out when she fucking

4119
03:33:17,280 --> 03:33:19,280
spawns in.

4120
03:33:23,280 --> 03:33:25,280
Go in.

4121
03:33:25,280 --> 03:33:27,280
Right.

4122
03:33:27,280 --> 03:33:29,280
It's not right.

4123
03:33:29,280 --> 03:33:31,280
And it's my head clearly because what is this?

4124
03:33:31,280 --> 03:33:33,280
Why is it not going in?

4125
03:33:35,280 --> 03:33:37,280
You can see I'm putting it in between the 4

4126
03:33:37,280 --> 03:33:39,280
and the middles and literally

4127
03:33:39,280 --> 03:33:41,280
snapping my fingers. Is it because I'm weak to be honest?

4128
03:33:45,280 --> 03:33:47,280
What the gen 2

4129
03:33:47,280 --> 03:33:49,280
do to deserve that, bro?

4130
03:33:49,280 --> 03:33:51,280
They didn't even pick to yet and I'm ready to curse them out.

4131
03:33:51,280 --> 03:33:53,280
It's the nail colour.

4132
03:33:53,280 --> 03:33:55,280
Go in.

4133
03:33:55,280 --> 03:33:57,280
Right, I'm picking another one.

4134
03:33:57,280 --> 03:33:59,280
Surely the problem is the stud

4135
03:33:59,280 --> 03:34:01,280
and it's not me, the common denominator

4136
03:34:01,280 --> 03:34:03,280
to all the problems.

4137
03:34:03,280 --> 03:34:05,280
Surely the common D...

4138
03:34:05,280 --> 03:34:07,280
No.

4139
03:34:07,280 --> 03:34:09,280
That actually hurt.

4140
03:34:09,280 --> 03:34:11,280
Oh, no.

4141
03:34:11,280 --> 03:34:13,280
I got...

4142
03:34:13,280 --> 03:34:15,280
Right, there's no gold bit on the door.

4143
03:34:15,280 --> 03:34:17,280
Okay.

4144
03:34:17,280 --> 03:34:19,280
There's no gold bit on the door.

4145
03:34:19,280 --> 03:34:21,280
Hi, Brad.

4146
03:34:23,280 --> 03:34:25,280
I think that's the star destroyer.

4147
03:34:25,280 --> 03:34:27,280
Thank you, Baylor, for the set.

4148
03:34:29,280 --> 03:34:31,280
How does the knob work in the middle of the door?

4149
03:34:31,280 --> 03:34:33,280
It fucking doesn't go on.

4150
03:34:37,280 --> 03:34:39,280
The nails are cute, at least.

4151
03:34:39,280 --> 03:34:41,280
All right, girls, cute.

4152
03:34:41,280 --> 03:34:43,280
Fucking pretty much.

4153
03:34:43,280 --> 03:34:45,280
Right.

4154
03:34:45,280 --> 03:34:47,280
I put this one wrong. Are you joking?

4155
03:34:47,280 --> 03:34:49,280
Oh, I put it on wrong.

4156
03:34:49,280 --> 03:34:51,280
Fucking gold bit.

4157
03:34:55,280 --> 03:34:57,280
And do you know how I know I've put it on wrong?

4158
03:34:57,280 --> 03:34:59,280
Because look at Gandalf's mark.

4159
03:34:59,280 --> 03:35:01,280
Remember in the moot?

4160
03:35:01,280 --> 03:35:03,280
Sorry, the light is really bad.

4161
03:35:03,280 --> 03:35:05,280
Remember in the movie when Gandalf marks the door?

4162
03:35:05,280 --> 03:35:07,280
Is that the...

4163
03:35:07,280 --> 03:35:09,280
The part you can see?

4164
03:35:09,280 --> 03:35:11,280
And then Bilbo was like, I just painted that.

4165
03:35:11,280 --> 03:35:13,280
Literally, there's the mark.

4166
03:35:13,280 --> 03:35:15,280
Right, okay, let's just put the door on.

4167
03:35:15,280 --> 03:35:17,280
Let's just put the door on.

4168
03:35:21,280 --> 03:35:23,280
Wait, hold on, wait.

4169
03:35:23,280 --> 03:35:25,280
Does it rotate?

4170
03:35:27,280 --> 03:35:29,280
Oh my gosh.

4171
03:35:31,280 --> 03:35:33,280
Oh my gosh. Hold on.

4172
03:35:33,280 --> 03:35:35,280
Okay, okay.

4173
03:35:35,280 --> 03:35:37,280
So this isn't... Wait, no, I need to...

4174
03:35:37,280 --> 03:35:39,280
I don't have another character yet.

4175
03:35:39,280 --> 03:35:41,280
Unless you want to play a sword. You don't fuck it.

4176
03:35:41,280 --> 03:35:43,280
You can be the sword. I'll rule play. Use the sword.

4177
03:35:43,280 --> 03:35:45,280
Are you ready?

4178
03:35:45,280 --> 03:35:47,280
Okay, so you're the sword.

4179
03:35:47,280 --> 03:35:49,280
And this is me. And you go

4180
03:35:49,280 --> 03:35:51,280
knock, knock, knock.

4181
03:35:51,280 --> 03:35:53,280
And I'll be like...

4182
03:35:53,280 --> 03:35:55,280
And then I open the door.

4183
03:35:55,280 --> 03:35:57,280
Oh my, yes, of course. And you come.

4184
03:35:57,280 --> 03:35:59,280
Refling. Oh my.

4185
03:35:59,280 --> 03:36:01,280
And then you come in and then you just ink

4186
03:36:01,280 --> 03:36:03,280
everywhere of excitement because you know what's coming next.

4187
03:36:05,280 --> 03:36:07,280
I enjoyed that rule play. We should rule play more.

4188
03:36:07,280 --> 03:36:09,280
Okay.

4189
03:36:09,280 --> 03:36:11,280
Next, I will...

4190
03:36:11,280 --> 03:36:13,280
Oh, I'll say cheers with our dog bowls.

4191
03:36:15,280 --> 03:36:17,280
We're to decorate

4192
03:36:17,280 --> 03:36:19,280
bag end a bit further.

4193
03:36:21,280 --> 03:36:23,280
Okay, I can do that.

4194
03:36:33,280 --> 03:36:35,280
There's a mistake on the sword. Get a fucker.

4195
03:36:37,280 --> 03:36:39,280
Oh, there's not a mistake on that sword.

4196
03:36:39,280 --> 03:36:41,280
It's actually just me. I'm just dumb.

4197
03:36:41,280 --> 03:36:43,280
I'm just dumb.

4198
03:36:45,280 --> 03:36:47,280
I love you. You're a dork.

4199
03:36:47,280 --> 03:36:49,280
Bro, I'm an aggressive dork.

4200
03:36:49,280 --> 03:36:51,280
Right, let's first up

4201
03:36:51,280 --> 03:36:53,280
bag end. It's looking a bit shite.

4202
03:36:53,280 --> 03:36:55,280
If this was on that bed and breakfast

4203
03:36:55,280 --> 03:36:57,280
British TV show, I completely

4204
03:36:57,280 --> 03:36:59,280
thought my name was that.

4205
03:36:59,280 --> 03:37:01,280
It was like people owned like bed and breakfast.

4206
03:37:03,280 --> 03:37:05,280
Oh my god, stop. This is so pretty.

4207
03:37:05,280 --> 03:37:07,280
Ow.

4208
03:37:07,280 --> 03:37:09,280
That's really starting to bend

4209
03:37:09,280 --> 03:37:11,280
my thumb back if I'm doing anything.

4210
03:37:11,280 --> 03:37:13,280
Can you?

4211
03:37:13,280 --> 03:37:15,280
Okay.

4212
03:37:15,280 --> 03:37:17,280
Can you go in?

4213
03:37:17,280 --> 03:37:19,280
Wait, is this got a space in between it?

4214
03:37:19,280 --> 03:37:21,280
It does. Okay.

4215
03:37:21,280 --> 03:37:23,280
I'm trying to put it in the corner.

4216
03:37:23,280 --> 03:37:25,280
I didn't even go in the corner. Sorry.

4217
03:37:25,280 --> 03:37:27,280
I'm trying to let you see what I'm trying to do.

4218
03:37:27,280 --> 03:37:29,280
It gets so dark in bag end.

4219
03:37:29,280 --> 03:37:31,280
Can someone light a candle? God damn.

4220
03:37:31,280 --> 03:37:33,280
Okay, there we go. Boom.

4221
03:37:33,280 --> 03:37:35,280
Okay.

4222
03:37:35,280 --> 03:37:37,280
Take the potion

4223
03:37:37,280 --> 03:37:39,280
and put

4224
03:37:39,280 --> 03:37:41,280
some lids on it.

4225
03:37:41,280 --> 03:37:43,280
I'm gonna, I need to fart so badly.

4226
03:37:43,280 --> 03:37:45,280
Please excuse me.

4227
03:37:45,280 --> 03:37:47,280
Excuse me one moment.

4228
03:37:47,280 --> 03:37:49,280
Oh, and of course I scared it away

4229
03:37:49,280 --> 03:37:51,280
the moment I said that. Like I announced it to the class.

4230
03:37:51,280 --> 03:37:53,280
Potatoes.

4231
03:37:53,280 --> 03:37:55,280
Boiling mushrooms.

4232
03:37:57,280 --> 03:37:59,280
Don't me out.

4233
03:37:59,280 --> 03:38:01,280
How dare you.

4234
03:38:01,280 --> 03:38:03,280
You wanna smell my voluptuous methane?

4235
03:38:03,280 --> 03:38:05,280
Oh my God, this looks like a sprite.

4236
03:38:05,280 --> 03:38:07,280
Oh, this is like a baby Christmas tree.

4237
03:38:07,280 --> 03:38:09,280
Oh Christmas tree.

4238
03:38:09,280 --> 03:38:11,280
Oh Christmas tree.

4239
03:38:11,280 --> 03:38:13,280
Why?

4240
03:38:13,280 --> 03:38:15,280
Right. I'm being trolled.

4241
03:38:15,280 --> 03:38:17,280
Why are none of the studs

4242
03:38:17,280 --> 03:38:19,280
going on correctly?

4243
03:38:19,280 --> 03:38:21,280
I can't believe I'm the problem.

4244
03:38:21,280 --> 03:38:23,280
No.

4245
03:38:23,280 --> 03:38:25,280
Right.

4246
03:38:25,280 --> 03:38:27,280
Gollum one.

4247
03:38:27,280 --> 03:38:29,280
I wish I could tell you this.

4248
03:38:29,280 --> 03:38:31,280
I wish I could tell you this.

4249
03:38:33,280 --> 03:38:35,280
Oh, we got it. It farted.

4250
03:38:35,280 --> 03:38:37,280
I don't know if you heard that audibly but it too did.

4251
03:38:37,280 --> 03:38:39,280
Right. Green potion in the corner.

4252
03:38:39,280 --> 03:38:41,280
I'm in the corner

4253
03:38:41,280 --> 03:38:43,280
Watching all your bad and

4254
03:38:43,280 --> 03:38:45,280
I

4255
03:38:45,280 --> 03:38:47,280
I

4256
03:38:47,280 --> 03:38:49,280
This is drawn yellow

4257
03:38:49,280 --> 03:38:51,280
but this is clearly

4258
03:38:51,280 --> 03:38:53,280
orange.

4259
03:38:53,280 --> 03:38:55,280
Okay.

4260
03:38:55,280 --> 03:38:57,280
The stud is a-

4261
03:38:57,280 --> 03:38:59,280
Not muting is an act

4262
03:38:59,280 --> 03:39:01,280
of companionship.

4263
03:39:01,280 --> 03:39:03,280
How dare you.

4264
03:39:03,280 --> 03:39:05,280
Testing my

4265
03:39:05,280 --> 03:39:07,280
Mr. Lord.

4266
03:39:09,280 --> 03:39:11,280
I mean, it looks like it's kind

4267
03:39:11,280 --> 03:39:13,280
of been opened and he's like not put that lid

4268
03:39:13,280 --> 03:39:15,280
back on so I can't get it.

4269
03:39:15,280 --> 03:39:17,280
Oh!

4270
03:39:17,280 --> 03:39:19,280
Hold on.

4271
03:39:19,280 --> 03:39:21,280
It's in the corner.

4272
03:39:21,280 --> 03:39:23,280
There we go.

4273
03:39:23,280 --> 03:39:25,280
Baggins starting to look a bit more

4274
03:39:25,280 --> 03:39:27,280
lived in.

4275
03:39:27,280 --> 03:39:29,280
Look at that.

4276
03:39:29,280 --> 03:39:31,280
Gorgeous stuff.

4277
03:39:31,280 --> 03:39:33,280
And look, the best part

4278
03:39:33,280 --> 03:39:35,280
in you come.

4279
03:39:35,280 --> 03:39:37,280
We do not come

4280
03:39:37,280 --> 03:39:39,280
into my bag end.

4281
03:39:39,280 --> 03:39:41,280
That's the- I have a new name for Marshall.

4282
03:39:43,280 --> 03:39:45,280
Right. Enough. Don't laugh at that.

4283
03:39:45,280 --> 03:39:47,280
That's not funny.

4284
03:39:47,280 --> 03:39:49,280
No strongy.

4285
03:39:49,280 --> 03:39:51,280
You can't just say you're a funny YouTuber.

4286
03:39:51,280 --> 03:39:53,280
Oh, cheers.

4287
03:39:53,280 --> 03:39:55,280
Just because you crack jokes all the time.

4288
03:39:55,280 --> 03:39:57,280
Right. Four.

4289
03:39:57,280 --> 03:39:59,280
What the fuck?

4290
03:39:59,280 --> 03:40:01,280
Four of these. One,

4291
03:40:01,280 --> 03:40:03,280
two, three,

4292
03:40:03,280 --> 03:40:05,280
four.

4293
03:40:05,280 --> 03:40:07,280
And then four

4294
03:40:07,280 --> 03:40:09,280
of these. One,

4295
03:40:09,280 --> 03:40:11,280
two, four, one.

4296
03:40:11,280 --> 03:40:13,280
Oh, I think I'm ovulating today

4297
03:40:13,280 --> 03:40:15,280
for no particular reason.

4298
03:40:15,280 --> 03:40:17,280
So I'm doing that.

4299
03:40:17,280 --> 03:40:19,280
I'm feeling-

4300
03:40:19,280 --> 03:40:21,280
Feeling rather slimy for a cuttlefish.

4301
03:40:21,280 --> 03:40:23,280
I would, but still couldn't.

4302
03:40:23,280 --> 03:40:25,280
Would

4303
03:40:25,280 --> 03:40:27,280
be the one ring to bend the bow.

4304
03:40:29,280 --> 03:40:31,280
There's a green piece four

4305
03:40:31,280 --> 03:40:33,280
units long

4306
03:40:33,280 --> 03:40:35,280
from some sets before you forgot.

4307
03:40:37,280 --> 03:40:39,280
There's a green piece four

4308
03:40:39,280 --> 03:40:41,280
units long. This

4309
03:40:41,280 --> 03:40:43,280
might be-

4310
03:40:43,280 --> 03:40:45,280
There's like an extra pieces I've got.

4311
03:40:45,280 --> 03:40:47,280
I've got extra pieces from the first set as well.

4312
03:40:47,280 --> 03:40:49,280
And I'm

4313
03:40:49,280 --> 03:40:51,280
not a worried Barbie

4314
03:40:51,280 --> 03:40:53,280
about the

4315
03:40:53,280 --> 03:40:55,280
I

4316
03:40:55,280 --> 03:40:57,280
think it's extra.

4317
03:40:59,280 --> 03:41:01,280
Oh, no, you're Ray Rieflin.

4318
03:41:01,280 --> 03:41:03,280
Holy fuck, you guys have to like

4319
03:41:03,280 --> 03:41:05,280
eagle vision. This is like Assassin's Creed

4320
03:41:05,280 --> 03:41:07,280
and you're the eagle. How do you

4321
03:41:07,280 --> 03:41:09,280
do that?

4322
03:41:09,280 --> 03:41:11,280
I don't know how you see that. How do you see that?

4323
03:41:11,280 --> 03:41:13,280
Literally bird's-eye view of the

4324
03:41:13,280 --> 03:41:15,280
shit. Fucking front row seats.

4325
03:41:15,280 --> 03:41:17,280
I don't know how you do that.

4326
03:41:17,280 --> 03:41:19,280
I don't know how you do that.

4327
03:41:21,280 --> 03:41:23,280
Are they smiley face in the bowl?

4328
03:41:23,280 --> 03:41:25,280
No.

4329
03:41:25,280 --> 03:41:27,280
Aww, let me see a little smile.

4330
03:41:31,280 --> 03:41:33,280
Yeah.

4331
03:41:35,280 --> 03:41:37,280
We gamers, we jump you.

4332
03:41:37,280 --> 03:41:39,280
We jump your ass.

4333
03:41:39,280 --> 03:41:41,280
Rain the crap. Right, okay.

4334
03:41:41,280 --> 03:41:43,280
Put these together

4335
03:41:43,280 --> 03:41:45,280
and bang them with a little two piece.

4336
03:41:45,280 --> 03:41:47,280
I can do that.

4337
03:41:47,280 --> 03:41:49,280
I can do that.

4338
03:41:49,280 --> 03:41:51,280
Okay, we're doing the door at back end.

4339
03:41:51,280 --> 03:41:53,280
I can do that.

4340
03:41:57,280 --> 03:41:59,280
Oh, I saw.

4341
03:41:59,280 --> 03:42:01,280
I saw.

4342
03:42:03,280 --> 03:42:05,280
Right, no more doing insults

4343
03:42:05,280 --> 03:42:07,280
in other languages. I've been really bad at that.

4344
03:42:07,280 --> 03:42:09,280
I just don't mind.

4345
03:42:09,280 --> 03:42:11,280
Oh, so it's like a blade in your heart.

4346
03:42:11,280 --> 03:42:13,280
For most

4347
03:42:13,280 --> 03:42:15,280
people.

4348
03:42:21,280 --> 03:42:23,280
Okay.

4349
03:42:23,280 --> 03:42:25,280
We now have the entrance

4350
03:42:25,280 --> 03:42:27,280
way to back end.

4351
03:42:27,280 --> 03:42:29,280
Right, collect it.

4352
03:42:29,280 --> 03:42:31,280
Do a flip.

4353
03:42:31,280 --> 03:42:33,280
Okay, we're flipping it gently because

4354
03:42:33,280 --> 03:42:35,280
the grass keeps coming flying off

4355
03:42:35,280 --> 03:42:37,280
and that's because of me. Okay, I'm the problem.

4356
03:42:37,280 --> 03:42:39,280
I am the problem.

4357
03:42:39,280 --> 03:42:41,280
I'm the problem.

4358
03:42:41,280 --> 03:42:43,280
Okay, now

4359
03:42:43,280 --> 03:42:45,280
just

4360
03:42:45,280 --> 03:42:47,280
like that.

4361
03:42:47,280 --> 03:42:49,280
I mean

4362
03:42:49,280 --> 03:42:51,280
it's what the diagram seems

4363
03:42:51,280 --> 03:42:53,280
that they're going to hold up.

4364
03:42:53,280 --> 03:42:55,280
Wait.

4365
03:42:59,280 --> 03:43:01,280
No, I don't think we can hold in it.

4366
03:43:03,280 --> 03:43:05,280
Not like

4367
03:43:05,280 --> 03:43:07,280
visually.

4368
03:43:07,280 --> 03:43:09,280
I think I can

4369
03:43:09,280 --> 03:43:11,280
Shragg in the bag.

4370
03:43:13,280 --> 03:43:15,280
Why are you so close?

4371
03:43:19,280 --> 03:43:21,280
There's so much to bring along in this room.

4372
03:43:29,280 --> 03:43:31,280
That was fun. Sorry if you heard that.

4373
03:43:31,280 --> 03:43:33,280
There's an internal control.

4374
03:43:33,280 --> 03:43:35,280
I

4375
03:43:35,280 --> 03:43:37,280
love it to pick anyway.

4376
03:43:37,280 --> 03:43:39,280
It was in the collars

4377
03:43:39,280 --> 03:43:41,280
in the dog bowl.

4378
03:43:41,280 --> 03:43:43,280
Choose your enemy.

4379
03:43:49,280 --> 03:43:51,280
That was a cute one, Anon.

4380
03:43:51,280 --> 03:43:53,280
Thank you for the tip.

4381
03:43:53,280 --> 03:43:55,280
I'll give you that one. That was a cute one.

4382
03:43:55,280 --> 03:43:57,280
Ever thought of making a video teaching

4383
03:43:57,280 --> 03:43:59,280
Scots? Yes.

4384
03:43:59,280 --> 03:44:01,280
Now that my

4385
03:44:01,280 --> 03:44:03,280
things are starting to come.

4386
03:44:03,280 --> 03:44:05,280
Is my hair in the fucking Lego set?

4387
03:44:05,280 --> 03:44:07,280
Oh for...

4388
03:44:07,280 --> 03:44:09,280
No, right. It was on it.

4389
03:44:09,280 --> 03:44:11,280
I swear if I like wedged my hair in between two blocks.

4390
03:44:11,280 --> 03:44:13,280
I was going to lose it.

4391
03:44:13,280 --> 03:44:15,280
If I don't lose it,

4392
03:44:15,280 --> 03:44:17,280
I'm going to lose it. Everybody gets two.

4393
03:44:17,280 --> 03:44:19,280
Oh, it does sit on.

4394
03:44:19,280 --> 03:44:21,280
Right, okay. It sits on. We've got the front door.

4395
03:44:21,280 --> 03:44:23,280
It's a bit skewed with, but hey,

4396
03:44:25,280 --> 03:44:27,280
this is very difficult.

4397
03:44:27,280 --> 03:44:29,280
Right, one,

4398
03:44:29,280 --> 03:44:31,280
two,

4399
03:44:31,280 --> 03:44:33,280
three,

4400
03:44:33,280 --> 03:44:35,280
one,

4401
03:44:35,280 --> 03:44:37,280
two,

4402
03:44:37,280 --> 03:44:39,280
three.

4403
03:44:39,280 --> 03:44:41,280
Okay, and then what do I do?

4404
03:44:41,280 --> 03:44:43,280
Put it at the bottom of the window.

4405
03:44:43,280 --> 03:44:45,280
Bottom of the window.

4406
03:44:45,280 --> 03:44:47,280
Put the wee hang on.

4407
03:44:47,280 --> 03:44:49,280
At the bottom of the window. I'll teach you some Scots right now.

4408
03:44:49,280 --> 03:44:51,280
To say

4409
03:44:51,280 --> 03:44:53,280
thing, you say hang,

4410
03:44:53,280 --> 03:44:55,280
but so we don't pronounce the G

4411
03:44:55,280 --> 03:44:57,280
at the end of I and G a lot.

4412
03:44:57,280 --> 03:44:59,280
So

4413
03:44:59,280 --> 03:45:01,280
if I was in accent mode

4414
03:45:01,280 --> 03:45:03,280
if I

4415
03:45:03,280 --> 03:45:05,280
needed you to pass me the

4416
03:45:05,280 --> 03:45:07,280
remote controller for

4417
03:45:07,280 --> 03:45:09,280
the TV

4418
03:45:09,280 --> 03:45:11,280
I would say

4419
03:45:11,280 --> 03:45:13,280
go and

4420
03:45:13,280 --> 03:45:15,280
go together.

4421
03:45:15,280 --> 03:45:17,280
Go and together is goon.

4422
03:45:17,280 --> 03:45:19,280
Goon, giz us

4423
03:45:19,280 --> 03:45:21,280
give us giz us

4424
03:45:21,280 --> 03:45:23,280
us is plural, but

4425
03:45:23,280 --> 03:45:25,280
it means me in that particular

4426
03:45:25,280 --> 03:45:27,280
accent structure. Goon, giz us

4427
03:45:29,280 --> 03:45:31,280
I've already forgotten what the original

4428
03:45:31,280 --> 03:45:33,280
word I was trying to teach it. What was

4429
03:45:33,280 --> 03:45:35,280
I trying to teach it?

4430
03:45:35,280 --> 03:45:37,280
What was the word? The remote, the

4431
03:45:37,280 --> 03:45:39,280
controller. Goon, giz us the remote.

4432
03:45:39,280 --> 03:45:41,280
What? No, what was I saying?

4433
03:45:41,280 --> 03:45:43,280
I've already forgotten my accent structure.

4434
03:45:43,280 --> 03:45:45,280
Sorry.

4435
03:45:47,280 --> 03:45:49,280
Goon, giz us. Oh, the hang, the hang.

4436
03:45:49,280 --> 03:45:51,280
There we go. The thing, the remote.

4437
03:45:51,280 --> 03:45:53,280
Goon, giz us the hang.

4438
03:45:53,280 --> 03:45:55,280
So basically

4439
03:45:55,280 --> 03:45:57,280
please pass me the remote.

4440
03:45:57,280 --> 03:45:59,280
Goon, giz us the hang.

4441
03:45:59,280 --> 03:46:01,280
That's

4442
03:46:01,280 --> 03:46:03,280
Scots. That's why I don't

4443
03:46:03,280 --> 03:46:05,280
teach it because

4444
03:46:05,280 --> 03:46:07,280
you would have no idea what I'm on about the last time.

4445
03:46:07,280 --> 03:46:09,280
Can you come?

4446
03:46:09,280 --> 03:46:11,280
Can you?

4447
03:46:11,280 --> 03:46:13,280
What do you need?

4448
03:46:13,280 --> 03:46:15,280
Oh, the window's fucking open.

4449
03:46:15,280 --> 03:46:17,280
Right, close the window Bilbo. It's

4450
03:46:17,280 --> 03:46:19,280
late, there's orcs out. Okay, fucking

4451
03:46:19,280 --> 03:46:21,280
close the window.

4452
03:46:21,280 --> 03:46:23,280
It's like Minecraft, as soon as you got

4453
03:46:23,280 --> 03:46:25,280
like a dirt block around you.

4454
03:46:25,280 --> 03:46:27,280
The hang,

4455
03:46:27,280 --> 03:46:29,280
the hang. Goon, giz us

4456
03:46:29,280 --> 03:46:31,280
the hang. You'd still

4457
03:46:31,280 --> 03:46:33,280
spell it with a G written down

4458
03:46:33,280 --> 03:46:35,280
but you wouldn't pronounce the G.

4459
03:46:35,280 --> 03:46:37,280
But the thing is it also depends

4460
03:46:37,280 --> 03:46:39,280
on context because if I was asking for

4461
03:46:39,280 --> 03:46:41,280
your willy, your willy,

4462
03:46:41,280 --> 03:46:43,280
your willy, your willy, Minky's

4463
03:46:43,280 --> 03:46:45,280
sausage, that would still make

4464
03:46:45,280 --> 03:46:47,280
the same sentence.

4465
03:46:47,280 --> 03:46:49,280
I would say Goon, giz me

4466
03:46:49,280 --> 03:46:51,280
your hang.

4467
03:46:51,280 --> 03:46:53,280
Be fun. Goon, giz me your hang.

4468
03:46:53,280 --> 03:46:55,280
Get a move on.

4469
03:46:55,280 --> 03:46:57,280
That still works as a sentence structure.

4470
03:46:57,280 --> 03:46:59,280
It's just context.

4471
03:46:59,280 --> 03:47:01,280
Goon, I've just broke this.

4472
03:47:01,280 --> 03:47:03,280
I don't know what broke. Something just broke.

4473
03:47:03,280 --> 03:47:05,280
Put them back, right.

4474
03:47:05,280 --> 03:47:07,280
Just fucking

4475
03:47:07,280 --> 03:47:09,280
hold on.

4476
03:47:11,280 --> 03:47:13,280
I'm sure

4477
03:47:13,280 --> 03:47:15,280
I'll be fine.

4478
03:47:15,280 --> 03:47:17,280
Well, that's it. We're going to continue to

4479
03:47:17,280 --> 03:47:19,280
build on

4480
03:47:19,280 --> 03:47:21,280
foundation. That isn't stable.

4481
03:47:25,280 --> 03:47:27,280
Go giz us your willy.

4482
03:47:27,280 --> 03:47:29,280
That was kind of, willy's

4483
03:47:29,280 --> 03:47:31,280
like, oh chin chin

4484
03:47:31,280 --> 03:47:33,280
like, young

4485
03:47:33,280 --> 03:47:35,280
way to say it. You wouldn't really say it

4486
03:47:35,280 --> 03:47:37,280
that.

4487
03:47:39,280 --> 03:47:41,280
On this side

4488
03:47:41,280 --> 03:47:43,280
put the wee one.

4489
03:47:43,280 --> 03:47:45,280
Say no more.

4490
03:47:45,280 --> 03:47:47,280
And on the other side

4491
03:47:47,280 --> 03:47:49,280
put the big one.

4492
03:47:53,280 --> 03:47:55,280
I feel

4493
03:47:55,280 --> 03:47:57,280
unasculated. Why is one side getting more

4494
03:47:57,280 --> 03:47:59,280
than one?

4495
03:47:59,280 --> 03:48:01,280
Ah, I've no got a schedule.

4496
03:48:01,280 --> 03:48:03,280
Nope,

4497
03:48:03,280 --> 03:48:05,280
he's gone.

4498
03:48:07,280 --> 03:48:09,280
Honestly, it's kind of go hot. Definitely need

4499
03:48:09,280 --> 03:48:11,280
a future Scottish term

4500
03:48:11,280 --> 03:48:13,280
in all of the extreme. I mean, I'll teach

4501
03:48:13,280 --> 03:48:15,280
it English if you want.

4502
03:48:15,280 --> 03:48:17,280
It's English to me. Do you know what I mean?

4503
03:48:17,280 --> 03:48:19,280
Like, you know what I mean.

4504
03:48:19,280 --> 03:48:21,280
It's not

4505
03:48:21,280 --> 03:48:23,280
Scottish.

4506
03:48:23,280 --> 03:48:25,280
It implies Alba.

4507
03:48:25,280 --> 03:48:27,280
I just made a mess on my Jessica Alba.

4508
03:48:29,280 --> 03:48:31,280
Ladies and gentlemen.

4509
03:48:31,280 --> 03:48:33,280
You're the one

4510
03:48:33,280 --> 03:48:35,280
you're the one

4511
03:48:35,280 --> 03:48:37,280
you're the one

4512
03:48:37,280 --> 03:48:39,280
you're the one

4513
03:48:39,280 --> 03:48:41,280
who they came to see

4514
03:48:41,280 --> 03:48:43,280
back

4515
03:48:43,280 --> 03:48:45,280
back

4516
03:48:45,280 --> 03:48:47,280
back

4517
03:48:47,280 --> 03:48:49,280
back

4518
03:48:49,280 --> 03:48:51,280
back

4519
03:48:51,280 --> 03:48:53,280
back

4520
03:48:53,280 --> 03:48:55,280
back

4521
03:48:55,280 --> 03:48:57,280
back by popular demand.

4522
03:48:59,280 --> 03:49:01,280
How does it feel? Is it like now?

4523
03:49:01,280 --> 03:49:03,280
What?

4524
03:49:03,280 --> 03:49:05,280
I

4525
03:49:09,280 --> 03:49:11,280
have an extra...

4526
03:49:11,280 --> 03:49:13,280
No.

4527
03:49:13,280 --> 03:49:15,280
I can't have an extra one of these. What is it?

4528
03:49:17,280 --> 03:49:19,280
It says use window there.

4529
03:49:19,280 --> 03:49:21,280
That one. No, can't be.

4530
03:49:21,280 --> 03:49:23,280
Can't be that one.

4531
03:49:23,280 --> 03:49:25,280
We already built it in.

4532
03:49:25,280 --> 03:49:27,280
And it can't be this one because it's mentioned

4533
03:49:27,280 --> 03:49:29,280
on this page.

4534
03:49:29,280 --> 03:49:31,280
Doorway!

4535
03:49:31,280 --> 03:49:33,280
Got it. Doorway.

4536
03:49:33,280 --> 03:49:35,280
Got it.

4537
03:49:35,280 --> 03:49:37,280
Oh my god. We finished part two.

4538
03:49:39,280 --> 03:49:41,280
Are you going to hear me part?

4539
03:49:43,280 --> 03:49:45,280
He's drowning. Your hands aren't sweaty all the time.

4540
03:49:45,280 --> 03:49:47,280
Oh yeah?

4541
03:49:47,280 --> 03:49:49,280
Oh yeah?

4542
03:49:49,280 --> 03:49:51,280
Now you're going to tell me to go clap.

4543
03:49:51,280 --> 03:49:53,280
I'll do it. Don't think I won. Right, we did it.

4544
03:49:53,280 --> 03:49:55,280
This...

4545
03:49:55,280 --> 03:49:57,280
It took us to get through one

4546
03:49:57,280 --> 03:49:59,280
part one

4547
03:49:59,280 --> 03:50:01,280
and it took us

4548
03:50:01,280 --> 03:50:03,280
four fucking hours.

4549
03:50:03,280 --> 03:50:05,280
And look at all these leftover pieces.

4550
03:50:05,280 --> 03:50:07,280
Well, Bilbo doesn't count.

4551
03:50:07,280 --> 03:50:09,280
But yeah, there's like

4552
03:50:09,280 --> 03:50:11,280
random assortments of

4553
03:50:11,280 --> 03:50:13,280
stuff.

4554
03:50:13,280 --> 03:50:15,280
I mean, I guess

4555
03:50:15,280 --> 03:50:17,280
I'm going to have to pour you out because I don't

4556
03:50:17,280 --> 03:50:19,280
need yous. We did what we had to do.

4557
03:50:19,280 --> 03:50:21,280
Bilbo, you come to the cycle.

4558
03:50:21,280 --> 03:50:23,280
Right, we're going to do

4559
03:50:23,280 --> 03:50:25,280
the next one. I'm not

4560
03:50:25,280 --> 03:50:27,280
quitting.

4561
03:50:27,280 --> 03:50:29,280
Okay, quit. Are you re-flin?

4562
03:50:29,280 --> 03:50:31,280
It's literally taking me two hours

4563
03:50:31,280 --> 03:50:33,280
to prepare a coffee.

4564
03:50:33,280 --> 03:50:35,280
Where's the other manual?

4565
03:50:35,280 --> 03:50:37,280
Oh, don't tell me I lost it.

4566
03:50:37,280 --> 03:50:39,280
Oh.

4567
03:50:39,280 --> 03:50:41,280
Okay, I got it.

4568
03:50:41,280 --> 03:50:43,280
I can't clap.

4569
03:50:45,280 --> 03:50:47,280
Oh, it feels nice.

4570
03:50:47,280 --> 03:50:49,280
Hold on. Wait, let me stand up and stretch.

4571
03:50:49,280 --> 03:50:51,280
I have to bloody go.

4572
03:50:51,280 --> 03:50:53,280
You want me to clap?

4573
03:50:53,280 --> 03:50:55,280
Oh, okay. Wait, can I do it without it?

4574
03:50:57,280 --> 03:50:59,280
I can't.

4575
03:51:07,280 --> 03:51:09,280
Is that what you want?

4576
03:51:09,280 --> 03:51:11,280
I love how this goes. I only discovered that

4577
03:51:11,280 --> 03:51:13,280
because of you guys. I can do it on command.

4578
03:51:13,280 --> 03:51:15,280
I don't know if it's a good idea.

4579
03:51:19,280 --> 03:51:21,280
Good girl.

4580
03:51:21,280 --> 03:51:23,280
How do I put color?

4581
03:51:25,280 --> 03:51:27,280
Sorry, I'm literally standing up.

4582
03:51:27,280 --> 03:51:29,280
I don't know if you can do a lot of doing this.

4583
03:51:29,280 --> 03:51:31,280
Well, this is good to throw it over it.

4584
03:51:35,280 --> 03:51:37,280
Yeah, this is it. Get the door.

4585
03:51:37,280 --> 03:51:39,280
Oh, shit, that was a really loud sorry.

4586
03:51:39,280 --> 03:51:41,280
Sorry. See, this is what I'm going to have on you.

4587
03:51:43,280 --> 03:51:45,280
Pass, cat, feet.

4588
03:51:45,280 --> 03:51:47,280
What do you mean feet? I did a whole stream about feet.

4589
03:51:47,280 --> 03:51:49,280
I'm probably going to do another one because I'm not

4590
03:51:49,280 --> 03:51:51,280
a catarina. I love her story.

4591
03:51:51,280 --> 03:51:53,280
But if you come by, I'm like, I don't know if you can do it.

4592
03:51:53,280 --> 03:51:55,280
Oh, I'm not fucking sure there's an agony.

4593
03:51:57,280 --> 03:51:59,280
Okay.

4594
03:51:59,280 --> 03:52:01,280
Right.

4595
03:52:01,280 --> 03:52:03,280
As reeflings

4596
03:52:03,280 --> 03:52:05,280
are my witness,

4597
03:52:05,280 --> 03:52:07,280
we will do the same method where I put

4598
03:52:07,280 --> 03:52:09,280
all the big ones in you

4599
03:52:09,280 --> 03:52:11,280
and then I'll put the wee ones in me.

4600
03:52:13,280 --> 03:52:15,280
No correlation to real life.

4601
03:52:19,280 --> 03:52:21,280
Fucking hell, what are we up against?

4602
03:52:23,280 --> 03:52:25,280
Alright, I'll put that in there.

4603
03:52:25,280 --> 03:52:27,280
Oh, there we go.

4604
03:52:27,280 --> 03:52:29,280
Oh, well, I see Gandalf.

4605
03:52:31,280 --> 03:52:33,280
I think this party's about to get bigger.

4606
03:52:33,280 --> 03:52:35,280
Hold on.

4607
03:52:35,280 --> 03:52:37,280
Okay, this manual...

4608
03:52:37,280 --> 03:52:39,280
Oh.

4609
03:52:39,280 --> 03:52:41,280
Is there any more sex I'd like?

4610
03:52:41,280 --> 03:52:43,280
Or am I being trolled?

4611
03:52:43,280 --> 03:52:45,280
Sorry, let's just...

4612
03:52:45,280 --> 03:52:47,280
Let me break it.

4613
03:52:47,280 --> 03:52:49,280
Sorry, let's just...

4614
03:52:49,280 --> 03:52:51,280
Let me browse the catalogue.

4615
03:52:51,280 --> 03:52:53,280
Is there any more sex I would want?

4616
03:52:55,280 --> 03:52:57,280
See, this is what I needed.

4617
03:52:57,280 --> 03:52:59,280
These little fucking scenes

4618
03:52:59,280 --> 03:53:01,280
where they're tiny and toty.

4619
03:53:01,280 --> 03:53:03,280
That's what I needed to do.

4620
03:53:03,280 --> 03:53:05,280
No, this fucking...

4621
03:53:05,280 --> 03:53:07,280
Oh, I just gave myself a paper cut.

4622
03:53:07,280 --> 03:53:09,280
Are you sure?

4623
03:53:11,280 --> 03:53:13,280
See, you fight a...

4624
03:53:13,280 --> 03:53:15,280
naughty sequence, fighting over the ring.

4625
03:53:15,280 --> 03:53:17,280
Rivendale.

4626
03:53:17,280 --> 03:53:19,280
Kind of yours.

4627
03:53:19,280 --> 03:53:21,280
Don't care.

4628
03:53:23,280 --> 03:53:25,280
What is this? A fucking...

4629
03:53:27,280 --> 03:53:29,280
I'll be finished.

4630
03:53:29,280 --> 03:53:31,280
Let's see if we can finish up.

4631
03:53:31,280 --> 03:53:33,280
Right, put Gandalf together.

4632
03:53:33,280 --> 03:53:35,280
Okay, let's put Gandalf together.

4633
03:53:35,280 --> 03:53:37,280
Oh, no, we've got three hobbits.

4634
03:53:39,280 --> 03:53:41,280
We've got three hobbits in this one.

4635
03:53:45,280 --> 03:53:47,280
She's feeding his little Tony to it.

4636
03:53:47,280 --> 03:53:49,280
I think that would still take you three hours.

4637
03:53:53,280 --> 03:53:55,280
Brap without cake

4638
03:53:55,280 --> 03:53:57,280
and clap without hands at the same time.

4639
03:53:57,280 --> 03:53:59,280
Brap without cake? What?

4640
03:53:59,280 --> 03:54:01,280
Brap without...

4641
03:54:01,280 --> 03:54:03,280
Take care of your shoulders, especially the cut.

4642
03:54:03,280 --> 03:54:05,280
Yeah, my right shoulder.

4643
03:54:07,280 --> 03:54:09,280
For mommy, let me clean your cut.

4644
03:54:09,280 --> 03:54:11,280
Yeah, mommy's handy.

4645
03:54:11,280 --> 03:54:13,280
It's not showing up, though.

4646
03:54:13,280 --> 03:54:15,280
It's my middle finger cut right through it,

4647
03:54:15,280 --> 03:54:17,280
but it's not showing up and I'm like,

4648
03:54:17,280 --> 03:54:19,280
oh, maybe I've got wings up.

4649
03:54:19,280 --> 03:54:21,280
Right, let's put Gandalf together.

4650
03:54:21,280 --> 03:54:23,280
He's somewhere in here.

4651
03:54:23,280 --> 03:54:25,280
Oh, there's buffers we have!

4652
03:54:25,280 --> 03:54:27,280
Oh, my God, even more plastic.

4653
03:54:27,280 --> 03:54:29,280
No.

4654
03:54:29,280 --> 03:54:31,280
Right, let's get his we have.

4655
03:54:31,280 --> 03:54:33,280
He must have got special need for it.

4656
03:54:37,280 --> 03:54:39,280
There's Old Man Beard.

4657
03:54:39,280 --> 03:54:41,280
That looks like Gandalf to me.

4658
03:54:41,280 --> 03:54:43,280
He seems like a determined fellow.

4659
03:54:43,280 --> 03:54:45,280
Oh, is we head drawn?

4660
03:54:45,280 --> 03:54:47,280
Head drawn.

4661
03:54:47,280 --> 03:54:49,280
What the fuck is that?

4662
03:54:49,280 --> 03:54:51,280
Oh, my God, he's been locked

4663
03:54:51,280 --> 03:54:53,280
in the carbon-freezing chamber for how long?

4664
03:54:53,280 --> 03:54:55,280
Who the fuck is behind this?

4665
03:54:57,280 --> 03:54:59,280
Out you come.

4666
03:55:03,280 --> 03:55:05,280
What?

4667
03:55:05,280 --> 03:55:07,280
Hello?

4668
03:55:07,280 --> 03:55:09,280
Oh, they're capes.

4669
03:55:11,280 --> 03:55:13,280
Are these...

4670
03:55:13,280 --> 03:55:15,280
Yeah?

4671
03:55:17,280 --> 03:55:19,280
Okay, um...

4672
03:55:23,280 --> 03:55:25,280
They look like capes,

4673
03:55:25,280 --> 03:55:27,280
but not capes.

4674
03:55:29,280 --> 03:55:31,280
Well, that would be for Gandalf.

4675
03:55:31,280 --> 03:55:33,280
That would be for you and then buffer,

4676
03:55:33,280 --> 03:55:35,280
and then I have a blonde...

4677
03:55:35,280 --> 03:55:37,280
I'm gonna put it in my bowl for now.

4678
03:55:37,280 --> 03:55:39,280
Okay, I did get a paper cut,

4679
03:55:39,280 --> 03:55:41,280
and I feel like...

4680
03:55:41,280 --> 03:55:43,280
Alright, Gandalf's hat.

4681
03:55:43,280 --> 03:55:45,280
Got it.

4682
03:55:47,280 --> 03:55:49,280
And then your body.

4683
03:55:49,280 --> 03:55:51,280
And then buffer's hat.

4684
03:55:51,280 --> 03:55:53,280
Can you flatten out?

4685
03:55:53,280 --> 03:55:55,280
Oh, my God, he's like...

4686
03:55:55,280 --> 03:55:57,280
Oh, he's covered in...

4687
03:55:57,280 --> 03:55:59,280
I mean, I guess he is actually a veteran battler.

4688
03:56:03,280 --> 03:56:05,280
And then your buffer.

4689
03:56:05,280 --> 03:56:07,280
Both of these moves.

4690
03:56:09,280 --> 03:56:11,280
Yes, I'm a child.

4691
03:56:11,280 --> 03:56:13,280
Okay, let's put the party together.

4692
03:56:13,280 --> 03:56:15,280
Um...

4693
03:56:15,280 --> 03:56:17,280
Coming up.

4694
03:56:17,280 --> 03:56:19,280
So you better get this packet.

4695
03:56:19,280 --> 03:56:21,280
Right, we can put Gandalf together.

4696
03:56:21,280 --> 03:56:23,280
So let's do that.

4697
03:56:23,280 --> 03:56:25,280
Right, put Gandalf's body in.

4698
03:56:25,280 --> 03:56:27,280
Okay.

4699
03:56:29,280 --> 03:56:31,280
Not a good time to lose one's head.

4700
03:56:31,280 --> 03:56:33,280
Don't tear them.

4701
03:56:33,280 --> 03:56:35,280
Not that I was planning on.

4702
03:56:35,280 --> 03:56:37,280
Is it like this?

4703
03:56:37,280 --> 03:56:39,280
Where you cross the paper over?

4704
03:56:39,280 --> 03:56:41,280
Oh, my God, this paper's made how many years ago?

4705
03:56:43,280 --> 03:56:45,280
I assume that's how I do it.

4706
03:56:45,280 --> 03:56:47,280
And then you put his head through the net.

4707
03:56:47,280 --> 03:56:49,280
Oh.

4708
03:56:51,280 --> 03:56:53,280
Let's find out.

4709
03:56:53,280 --> 03:56:55,280
Yeah, that seems right.

4710
03:56:55,280 --> 03:56:57,280
Oh, this.

4711
03:56:57,280 --> 03:56:59,280
Right, let's try again.

4712
03:56:59,280 --> 03:57:01,280
Are you squiddin' me right now?

4713
03:57:01,280 --> 03:57:03,280
Try, try, try as you make.

4714
03:57:03,280 --> 03:57:05,280
Brain.

4715
03:57:05,280 --> 03:57:07,280
Gun.

4716
03:57:07,280 --> 03:57:09,280
Can you not see how much I'm struggling right now?

4717
03:57:09,280 --> 03:57:13,280
And you want me to upgrade my tier to Gun-Puzz?

4718
03:57:13,280 --> 03:57:17,280
I am struggling so hard with Lego.

4719
03:57:17,280 --> 03:57:19,280
For nine-year-olds!

4720
03:57:21,280 --> 03:57:23,280
And you want Gunpla?

4721
03:57:23,280 --> 03:57:25,280
Is there sexy Gunpla?

4722
03:57:25,280 --> 03:57:27,280
Is there sexy one?

4723
03:57:27,280 --> 03:57:29,280
Thank you for the tip.

4724
03:57:29,280 --> 03:57:31,280
Gun-Hole Warith.

4725
03:57:31,280 --> 03:57:33,280
Brave.

4726
03:57:33,280 --> 03:57:35,280
I can't put the cape on.

4727
03:57:35,280 --> 03:57:37,280
The cape is upside down.

4728
03:57:37,280 --> 03:57:39,280
I don't know.

4729
03:57:39,280 --> 03:57:41,280
Like...

4730
03:57:41,280 --> 03:57:43,280
Is it?

4731
03:57:43,280 --> 03:57:45,280
Because it's not...

4732
03:57:45,280 --> 03:57:47,280
Oh, no, I didn't...

4733
03:57:47,280 --> 03:57:49,280
No, I can't laugh.

4734
03:57:51,280 --> 03:57:53,280
Please.

4735
03:57:53,280 --> 03:57:55,280
What the...

4736
03:57:55,280 --> 03:57:57,280
That's the best I've got.

4737
03:57:57,280 --> 03:57:59,280
Gandalf, seal the deal.

4738
03:57:59,280 --> 03:58:01,280
That's the best I've got.

4739
03:58:01,280 --> 03:58:03,280
Shavonia.

4740
03:58:03,280 --> 03:58:05,280
Right, and then put your wee hat on.

4741
03:58:05,280 --> 03:58:07,280
Where's your beard?

4742
03:58:09,280 --> 03:58:11,280
Where's your beard?

4743
03:58:11,280 --> 03:58:13,280
Did you shave it off?

4744
03:58:13,280 --> 03:58:15,280
Oh my god, no buffers parts are in here.

4745
03:58:15,280 --> 03:58:17,280
I can see his little mane in his thing.

4746
03:58:17,280 --> 03:58:19,280
Okay, okay.

4747
03:58:19,280 --> 03:58:21,280
I'll empty this one out.

4748
03:58:21,280 --> 03:58:23,280
There's something in here.

4749
03:58:23,280 --> 03:58:25,280
Right.

4750
03:58:27,280 --> 03:58:29,280
As you're my witness.

4751
03:58:29,280 --> 03:58:31,280
Please.

4752
03:58:31,280 --> 03:58:33,280
Okay.

4753
03:58:33,280 --> 03:58:35,280
Oh.

4754
03:58:35,280 --> 03:58:37,280
Okay, okay.

4755
03:58:37,280 --> 03:58:39,280
Oh my...

4756
03:58:39,280 --> 03:58:41,280
Fuckin' shoulders, really.

4757
03:58:41,280 --> 03:58:43,280
I'm gonna be in... What am I doing tomorrow,

4758
03:58:43,280 --> 03:58:45,280
by the way, stream-wise?

4759
03:58:45,280 --> 03:58:47,280
Just so I know how much I can fuck my shoulder

4760
03:58:47,280 --> 03:58:49,280
up right now.

4761
03:58:49,280 --> 03:58:51,280
On...

4762
03:58:51,280 --> 03:58:53,280
Right, and then that's his beard.

4763
03:58:53,280 --> 03:58:55,280
Wait a minute.

4764
03:58:55,280 --> 03:58:57,280
Oh no, it goes to his cape, his beard, his head.

4765
03:58:57,280 --> 03:58:59,280
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

4766
03:58:59,280 --> 03:59:01,280
Ugh, might take more.

4767
03:59:01,280 --> 03:59:03,280
His beard?

4768
03:59:03,280 --> 03:59:05,280
What, like, it just sits there?

4769
03:59:05,280 --> 03:59:07,280
Oh, oh yeah.

4770
03:59:07,280 --> 03:59:09,280
Oh yeah, he went to Spain.

4771
03:59:09,280 --> 03:59:11,280
Without this.

4772
03:59:15,280 --> 03:59:17,280
Mm-hmm.

4773
03:59:17,280 --> 03:59:19,280
And then his head.

4774
03:59:19,280 --> 03:59:21,280
And then a wizard's cap.

4775
03:59:21,280 --> 03:59:23,280
Oh my god.

4776
03:59:23,280 --> 03:59:25,280
That'll do.

4777
03:59:25,280 --> 03:59:27,280
Hold on as we...

4778
03:59:27,280 --> 03:59:29,280
Mouse shouldn't be.

4779
03:59:29,280 --> 03:59:31,280
That looks like him. Okay, there we go.

4780
03:59:31,280 --> 03:59:33,280
We go out.

4781
03:59:39,280 --> 03:59:41,280
We'll role-play at the end.

4782
03:59:41,280 --> 03:59:43,280
And we'll watch an Austin Poe.

4783
03:59:43,280 --> 03:59:45,280
Chain together, solo in Austin Poe.

4784
03:59:45,280 --> 03:59:47,280
You should rest your shoulder.

4785
03:59:47,280 --> 03:59:49,280
It's... It's because of the way I hold it.

4786
03:59:49,280 --> 03:59:51,280
I don't know why.

4787
03:59:51,280 --> 03:59:53,280
I insist on, like,

4788
03:59:53,280 --> 03:59:55,280
is it hunched?

4789
03:59:55,280 --> 03:59:57,280
Like, is it hunched?

4790
03:59:57,280 --> 03:59:59,280
I like hunched my shoulders.

4791
03:59:59,280 --> 04:00:01,280
And it...

4792
04:00:01,280 --> 04:00:03,280
My right one's being hunched right, man.

4793
04:00:03,280 --> 04:00:05,280
It's a...

4794
04:00:05,280 --> 04:00:07,280
It's starting to be jeep.

4795
04:00:07,280 --> 04:00:09,280
That's another Scottish word.

4796
04:00:09,280 --> 04:00:11,280
I can teach you jeep. It's being made jeep.

4797
04:00:11,280 --> 04:00:13,280
Where the f...

4798
04:00:13,280 --> 04:00:15,280
Why do I only have one pair of legs?

4799
04:00:23,280 --> 04:00:25,280
Well, he's in a wheelchair now.

4800
04:00:25,280 --> 04:00:27,280
I only have one pair of legs.

4801
04:00:27,280 --> 04:00:29,280
Woffer's legs are brown,

4802
04:00:29,280 --> 04:00:31,280
so this is definitely Balan's.

4803
04:00:31,280 --> 04:00:33,280
So...

4804
04:00:33,280 --> 04:00:35,280
Get out of here.

4805
04:00:35,280 --> 04:00:37,280
And Balan has a sword.

4806
04:00:37,280 --> 04:00:39,280
E.K.

4807
04:00:39,280 --> 04:00:41,280
E.K.

4808
04:00:41,280 --> 04:00:43,280
E.K.

4809
04:00:43,280 --> 04:00:45,280
E.K.

4810
04:00:45,280 --> 04:00:47,280
E.K.

4811
04:00:47,280 --> 04:00:49,280
Balan.

4812
04:00:49,280 --> 04:00:51,280
More like

4813
04:00:51,280 --> 04:00:53,280
Balan.

4814
04:00:53,280 --> 04:00:55,280
I think...

4815
04:00:55,280 --> 04:00:57,280
Wait.

4816
04:00:57,280 --> 04:00:59,280
No, that one goes on top.

4817
04:00:59,280 --> 04:01:01,280
Okay, we just got a prank played on.

4818
04:01:01,280 --> 04:01:03,280
So he's covered in scars because he's actually a war veteran.

4819
04:01:03,280 --> 04:01:05,280
But...

4820
04:01:05,280 --> 04:01:07,280
He should be retired.

4821
04:01:07,280 --> 04:01:09,280
But, you know, he is.

4822
04:01:09,280 --> 04:01:11,280
Any other time.

4823
04:01:11,280 --> 04:01:13,280
Right, and then what? Okay, that's him made.

4824
04:01:13,280 --> 04:01:15,280
Balan is up. So Woffer...

4825
04:01:15,280 --> 04:01:17,280
Unless

4826
04:01:17,280 --> 04:01:19,280
his little crippled legs are in here.

4827
04:01:19,280 --> 04:01:21,280
I think we have

4828
04:01:21,280 --> 04:01:23,280
our first

4829
04:01:23,280 --> 04:01:25,280
Colbert officially claiming disability.

4830
04:01:25,280 --> 04:01:27,280
Which is fantastic.

4831
04:01:27,280 --> 04:01:29,280
Stable Hobbit.

4832
04:01:29,280 --> 04:01:31,280
Oh my...

4833
04:01:31,280 --> 04:01:33,280
His legs are brown.

4834
04:01:37,280 --> 04:01:39,280
I'm combing

4835
04:01:41,280 --> 04:01:43,280
under Balan's sword.

4836
04:01:43,280 --> 04:01:45,280
Balan

4837
04:01:49,280 --> 04:01:51,280
He loves his physicality in Hobbit.

4838
04:01:51,280 --> 04:01:53,280
He believes everyone has a right to live.

4839
04:01:57,280 --> 04:01:59,280
Right, sorry, I'm giving

4840
04:01:59,280 --> 04:02:01,280
I'm having a stroke, it was nice knowing that.

4841
04:02:01,280 --> 04:02:03,280
Cheers.

4842
04:02:03,280 --> 04:02:05,280
Sorry, I just did a really big

4843
04:02:05,280 --> 04:02:07,280
sniff layer which I'm not

4844
04:02:07,280 --> 04:02:09,280
supposed to do into the microphone.

4845
04:02:09,280 --> 04:02:11,280
But I did it.

4846
04:02:11,280 --> 04:02:13,280
Right, okay, we've just got a disabled Hobbit.

4847
04:02:13,280 --> 04:02:15,280
Where's his face gone?

4848
04:02:15,280 --> 04:02:17,280
Are you squidding me right now?

4849
04:02:17,280 --> 04:02:19,280
I don't know, are you squidding me right now?

4850
04:02:29,280 --> 04:02:31,280
I just really enjoyed the satisfaction

4851
04:02:31,280 --> 04:02:33,280
of the game.

4852
04:02:33,280 --> 04:02:35,280
I found it really

4853
04:02:35,280 --> 04:02:37,280
satisfying just reloading and then

4854
04:02:37,280 --> 04:02:39,280
try and get to the next area.

4855
04:02:39,280 --> 04:02:41,280
So I was just gonna like...

4856
04:02:41,280 --> 04:02:43,280
I wanna place this on my own.

4857
04:02:43,280 --> 04:02:45,280
So I was just gonna do it

4858
04:02:45,280 --> 04:02:47,280
and have fun news

4859
04:02:47,280 --> 04:02:49,280
because

4860
04:02:49,280 --> 04:02:51,280
can I get in?

4861
04:02:51,280 --> 04:02:53,280
I can.

4862
04:02:55,280 --> 04:02:57,280
I'm gonna do it on my Streamsnap account

4863
04:02:57,280 --> 04:02:59,280
because in case there's somewhere

4864
04:02:59,280 --> 04:03:01,280
I get stuck because

4865
04:03:01,280 --> 04:03:03,280
when I ended it on the collab

4866
04:03:05,280 --> 04:03:07,280
Misma

4867
04:03:07,280 --> 04:03:09,280
was the location where we had to

4868
04:03:09,280 --> 04:03:11,280
sling off of it together

4869
04:03:11,280 --> 04:03:13,280
and I was like, ew.

4870
04:03:13,280 --> 04:03:15,280
So I might very quickly get a Streamsnap refund

4871
04:03:15,280 --> 04:03:17,280
and

4872
04:03:17,280 --> 04:03:19,280
I don't know.

4873
04:03:19,280 --> 04:03:21,280
And then we'll watch Austin Powers

4874
04:03:21,280 --> 04:03:23,280
The Spy who's

4875
04:03:23,280 --> 04:03:25,280
or something like that. I can't remember.

4876
04:03:25,280 --> 04:03:27,280
I've not seen it before.

4877
04:03:27,280 --> 04:03:29,280
So before you expect me to be like quoting what's coming up

4878
04:03:29,280 --> 04:03:31,280
Oh, his legs!

4879
04:03:31,280 --> 04:03:33,280
Before you expect me to

4880
04:03:33,280 --> 04:03:35,280
be

4881
04:03:35,280 --> 04:03:37,280
like

4882
04:03:37,280 --> 04:03:39,280
Oh, there we go.

4883
04:03:39,280 --> 04:03:41,280
Okay, here we go.

4884
04:03:41,280 --> 04:03:43,280
Why do you look angy?

4885
04:03:43,280 --> 04:03:45,280
Angy?

4886
04:03:45,280 --> 04:03:47,280
Is that the wrong face?

4887
04:03:49,280 --> 04:03:51,280
Is this

4888
04:03:51,280 --> 04:03:53,280
swollen?

4889
04:03:53,280 --> 04:03:55,280
No, it's not.

4890
04:03:59,280 --> 04:04:01,280
Does he have a different face on the other side?

4891
04:04:05,280 --> 04:04:07,280
He does. He smells in there.

4892
04:04:09,280 --> 04:04:11,280
I'm not sure that...

4893
04:04:11,280 --> 04:04:13,280
I thought the buffer

4894
04:04:13,280 --> 04:04:15,280
is in there.

4895
04:04:15,280 --> 04:04:17,280
Is it swollen or something?

4896
04:04:17,280 --> 04:04:19,280
Oh my God!

4897
04:04:19,280 --> 04:04:21,280
Fucking Harry Potter up in here.

4898
04:04:23,280 --> 04:04:25,280
That's a query though.

4899
04:04:25,280 --> 04:04:27,280
I am on your back.

4900
04:04:27,280 --> 04:04:29,280
What? Do they all have?

4901
04:04:29,280 --> 04:04:31,280
That was fucking creepy.

4902
04:04:31,280 --> 04:04:33,280
There were certain things on your back when we walked.

4903
04:04:33,280 --> 04:04:35,280
Thank you, Nero, for the tip.

4904
04:04:35,280 --> 04:04:37,280
So we're doing that tomorrow.

4905
04:04:37,280 --> 04:04:39,280
That'll be better.

4906
04:04:41,280 --> 04:04:43,280
Okay, we're doing the front

4907
04:04:43,280 --> 04:04:45,280
of the house now.

4908
04:04:45,280 --> 04:04:47,280
We need

4909
04:04:47,280 --> 04:04:49,280
four

4910
04:04:49,280 --> 04:04:51,280
wee skinny bits.

4911
04:04:51,280 --> 04:04:53,280
Not that long.

4912
04:04:53,280 --> 04:04:55,280
That was a bit too long.

4913
04:04:57,280 --> 04:04:59,280
What are you trying to achieve?

4914
04:04:59,280 --> 04:05:01,280
I'm not sure.

4915
04:05:01,280 --> 04:05:03,280
Oh my God!

4916
04:05:03,280 --> 04:05:05,280
It's just like the barrels and Lego Lord of the Rings.

4917
04:05:05,280 --> 04:05:07,280
Where they have all the weaponry inside it.

4918
04:05:11,280 --> 04:05:13,280
I didn't even know they had two faces.

4919
04:05:13,280 --> 04:05:15,280
I was like, uh, hold on a minute.

4920
04:05:17,280 --> 04:05:19,280
Wait, so this...

4921
04:05:19,280 --> 04:05:21,280
Is that why Bilbo looks so weird?

4922
04:05:21,280 --> 04:05:23,280
Okay, yeah.

4923
04:05:23,280 --> 04:05:25,280
Literally, I was like, why is he so weird?

4924
04:05:25,280 --> 04:05:27,280
He isn't his own history.

4925
04:05:27,280 --> 04:05:29,280
Everyone,

4926
04:05:29,280 --> 04:05:31,280
we're playing happy families.

4927
04:05:31,280 --> 04:05:33,280
Put your happy faces on.

4928
04:05:33,280 --> 04:05:35,280
I won't tolerate anything less than fake happiness.

4929
04:05:37,280 --> 04:05:39,280
I'm going to put your game face

4930
04:05:45,280 --> 04:05:47,280
No, not that one.

4931
04:05:51,280 --> 04:05:53,280
The very piece I need to just

4932
04:05:53,280 --> 04:05:55,280
flew out of my hand somewhere.

4933
04:05:55,280 --> 04:05:57,280
Oh, there it is.

4934
04:05:57,280 --> 04:05:59,280
I need one.

4935
04:05:59,280 --> 04:06:01,280
I need two gray squares.

4936
04:06:01,280 --> 04:06:03,280
Which I guess are over here.

4937
04:06:03,280 --> 04:06:05,280
Because they're not in your doggy bow.

4938
04:06:07,280 --> 04:06:09,280
I need six poop studs.

4939
04:06:09,280 --> 04:06:11,280
You know.

4940
04:06:11,280 --> 04:06:13,280
Dos.

4941
04:06:13,280 --> 04:06:15,280
Cuatro.

4942
04:06:15,280 --> 04:06:17,280
Cinco.

4943
04:06:17,280 --> 04:06:19,280
Se.

4944
04:06:19,280 --> 04:06:21,280
Se.

4945
04:06:21,280 --> 04:06:23,280
Oh wait, was it Cinco?

4946
04:06:23,280 --> 04:06:25,280
Undos.

4947
04:06:25,280 --> 04:06:27,280
I know it's kind of hard to stay

4948
04:06:27,280 --> 04:06:29,280
there all of the day.

4949
04:06:29,280 --> 04:06:31,280
He asked for a tattoo, yeah.

4950
04:06:31,280 --> 04:06:33,280
He asked for a 13,

4951
04:06:33,280 --> 04:06:35,280
but instead they drew a 31.

4952
04:06:35,280 --> 04:06:37,280
And I've been saying,

4953
04:06:37,280 --> 04:06:39,280
you know

4954
04:06:39,280 --> 04:06:41,280
you might never know that every day.

4955
04:06:41,280 --> 04:06:43,280
The world knows

4956
04:06:43,280 --> 04:06:45,280
what I've been so

4957
04:06:45,280 --> 04:06:47,280
hey, hey, do whatever you think.

4958
04:06:47,280 --> 04:06:49,280
And that's all that I need.

4959
04:06:49,280 --> 04:06:51,280
And that's all that I need.

4960
04:06:51,280 --> 04:06:53,280
That's all that I need.

4961
04:06:53,280 --> 04:06:55,280
That's all that you can

4962
04:06:55,280 --> 04:06:57,280
a cappella cariol too.

4963
04:06:57,280 --> 04:06:59,280
And all that

4964
04:06:59,280 --> 04:07:01,280
does stand pretty flat

4965
04:07:01,280 --> 04:07:03,280
for a white dog.

4966
04:07:05,280 --> 04:07:07,280
What is that?

4967
04:07:07,280 --> 04:07:09,280
A bit of fluff.

4968
04:07:09,280 --> 04:07:11,280
Go, go.

4969
04:07:11,280 --> 04:07:13,280
I'm taking that fluff with me.

4970
04:07:13,280 --> 04:07:15,280
Okay, mama, that's my family.

4971
04:07:15,280 --> 04:07:17,280
You can be the puffy one over here all the way.

4972
04:07:17,280 --> 04:07:19,280
Whoa, what the fuck? You can't combine.

4973
04:07:19,280 --> 04:07:21,280
You can't combine the special

4974
04:07:21,280 --> 04:07:23,280
interest.

4975
04:07:23,280 --> 04:07:25,280
That is illegal.

4976
04:07:25,280 --> 04:07:27,280
That's...

4977
04:07:27,280 --> 04:07:29,280
That's the penalty.

4978
04:07:29,280 --> 04:07:31,280
You can't combine

4979
04:07:31,280 --> 04:07:33,280
the naughty

4980
04:07:33,280 --> 04:07:35,280
and the interest.

4981
04:07:39,280 --> 04:07:41,280
I promise

4982
04:07:41,280 --> 04:07:43,280
we will do karaoke soon to you.

4983
04:07:43,280 --> 04:07:45,280
Soon to you we'll do karaoke.

4984
04:07:45,280 --> 04:07:47,280
I'm gonna force you to do my karaoke first

4985
04:07:47,280 --> 04:07:49,280
because it'll be songs that I know

4986
04:07:49,280 --> 04:07:51,280
like

4987
04:07:51,280 --> 04:07:53,280
a rabie and I

4988
04:07:53,280 --> 04:07:55,280
a rabie and I

4989
04:07:59,280 --> 04:08:01,280
like a rabie

4990
04:08:05,280 --> 04:08:07,280
more often than not

4991
04:08:07,280 --> 04:08:09,280
our hotter than not

4992
04:08:09,280 --> 04:08:11,280
in a lot of good

4993
04:08:11,280 --> 04:08:13,280
words.

4994
04:08:13,280 --> 04:08:15,280
Yes, we'll do karaoke.

4995
04:08:15,280 --> 04:08:17,280
Um...

4996
04:08:17,280 --> 04:08:19,280
I'm a bit wary of

4997
04:08:19,280 --> 04:08:21,280
DMCA streams.

4998
04:08:21,280 --> 04:08:23,280
Did you hear about that?

4999
04:08:23,280 --> 04:08:25,280
Fucking...

5000
04:08:25,280 --> 04:08:27,280
Did you hear about Iron Mouses?

5001
04:08:27,280 --> 04:08:29,280
Vodchannel got DMC newt.

5002
04:08:29,280 --> 04:08:31,280
Um...

5003
04:08:31,280 --> 04:08:33,280
They were saying like...

5004
04:08:33,280 --> 04:08:35,280
So people were

5005
04:08:35,280 --> 04:08:37,280
think, thought it was about

5006
04:08:37,280 --> 04:08:39,280
this ball for heaven.

5007
04:08:39,280 --> 04:08:41,280
I did put a table.

5008
04:08:41,280 --> 04:08:43,280
Folk were like, oh, it's cause

5009
04:08:43,280 --> 04:08:45,280
someone hurt a doc's herself

5010
04:08:45,280 --> 04:08:47,280
or that as if she can't just use the fucking

5011
04:08:47,280 --> 04:08:49,280
company's info.

5012
04:08:49,280 --> 04:08:51,280
Um...

5013
04:08:51,280 --> 04:08:53,280
And then the person

5014
04:08:53,280 --> 04:08:55,280
who owned Vodchannel came

5015
04:08:55,280 --> 04:08:57,280
out and was like, no,

5016
04:08:57,280 --> 04:08:59,280
it's cause of the react Andy

5017
04:08:59,280 --> 04:09:01,280
and it was like...

5018
04:09:01,280 --> 04:09:03,280
I mean

5019
04:09:03,280 --> 04:09:05,280
it's a shame cause that

5020
04:09:05,280 --> 04:09:07,280
that was a Vodchannel.

5021
04:09:07,280 --> 04:09:09,280
That was an inc- where the fuck is this one?

5022
04:09:13,280 --> 04:09:15,280
Um, it's a shame cause

5023
04:09:15,280 --> 04:09:17,280
like that Vodchannel had like

5024
04:09:17,280 --> 04:09:19,280
literally everything on it and obviously

5025
04:09:19,280 --> 04:09:21,280
you make money on Vods like

5026
04:09:21,280 --> 04:09:23,280
I know sometimes you might be like, oh, why is

5027
04:09:23,280 --> 04:09:25,280
this streamer bothered about like

5028
04:09:25,280 --> 04:09:27,280
a Vod not making...

5029
04:09:27,280 --> 04:09:29,280
Like if it got copyright struck cause

5030
04:09:29,280 --> 04:09:31,280
oh, it's only gonna make 200 views

5031
04:09:31,280 --> 04:09:33,280
and

5032
04:09:33,280 --> 04:09:35,280
you know, which isn't even a dollar

5033
04:09:35,280 --> 04:09:37,280
or statistically.

5034
04:09:37,280 --> 04:09:39,280
Okay, there is, I found it, thank god.

5035
04:09:39,280 --> 04:09:41,280
Um...

5036
04:09:41,280 --> 04:09:43,280
Oh my god, I get to make a little

5037
04:09:43,280 --> 04:09:45,280
pathway.

5038
04:09:45,280 --> 04:09:47,280
Aw, this is so cute.

5039
04:09:47,280 --> 04:09:49,280
Put a little stepping stones up

5040
04:09:49,280 --> 04:09:51,280
to our house together and back in.

5041
04:09:51,280 --> 04:09:53,280
Um...

5042
04:09:53,280 --> 04:09:55,280
Like I know it would be like, oh, why is

5043
04:09:55,280 --> 04:09:57,280
it like such a big deal? It's like

5044
04:09:57,280 --> 04:09:59,280
insane passive income. YouTube ads

5045
04:09:59,280 --> 04:10:01,280
I get that they're fucking annoying, trust

5046
04:10:01,280 --> 04:10:03,280
me, I'm on it too, they're

5047
04:10:03,280 --> 04:10:05,280
annoying. Um...

5048
04:10:05,280 --> 04:10:07,280
But like, can if you have YouTube premium

5049
04:10:07,280 --> 04:10:09,280
I'm actually gonna talk about this in a

5050
04:10:09,280 --> 04:10:11,280
short when it comes to ASMR.

5051
04:10:11,280 --> 04:10:13,280
Um...

5052
04:10:13,280 --> 04:10:15,280
Your YouTube premium, depending

5053
04:10:15,280 --> 04:10:17,280
goes like, the majority of the money goes to

5054
04:10:17,280 --> 04:10:19,280
whoever you watch the most, so like, say if

5055
04:10:19,280 --> 04:10:21,280
you left your YouTube premium

5056
04:10:21,280 --> 04:10:23,280
completely on me for whatever reason.

5057
04:10:23,280 --> 04:10:25,280
If you're like, ah, I just need more of that

5058
04:10:25,280 --> 04:10:27,280
Scottish accent. Um...

5059
04:10:27,280 --> 04:10:29,280
Like it adds up as passive income

5060
04:10:29,280 --> 04:10:31,280
and passive income, i.e.

5061
04:10:31,280 --> 04:10:33,280
don't have to stream for it, didn't have the plan or anything

5062
04:10:33,280 --> 04:10:35,280
like that, like that's why ASMR is also like

5063
04:10:35,280 --> 04:10:37,280
a really good thing. Cause people, if you

5064
04:10:37,280 --> 04:10:39,280
make a good roleplay, people will come back

5065
04:10:39,280 --> 04:10:41,280
and listen to it. Um...

5066
04:10:41,280 --> 04:10:43,280
And you get paid

5067
04:10:43,280 --> 04:10:45,280
way more, way way more

5068
04:10:45,280 --> 04:10:47,280
for a return

5069
04:10:47,280 --> 04:10:49,280
viewer than you

5070
04:10:49,280 --> 04:10:51,280
do a new viewer, to make sense.

5071
04:10:51,280 --> 04:10:53,280
So if you click on the video

5072
04:10:53,280 --> 04:10:55,280
for the first time and you watch and add

5073
04:10:55,280 --> 04:10:57,280
on it, statistically

5074
04:10:57,280 --> 04:10:59,280
it takes 1,000 new

5075
04:10:59,280 --> 04:11:01,280
views, this is statistics

5076
04:11:01,280 --> 04:11:03,280
like medieval. Um...

5077
04:11:03,280 --> 04:11:05,280
1,000 new views would make

5078
04:11:05,280 --> 04:11:07,280
a dollar, right?

5079
04:11:07,280 --> 04:11:09,280
It would

5080
04:11:09,280 --> 04:11:11,280
take

5081
04:11:11,280 --> 04:11:13,280
200

5082
04:11:13,280 --> 04:11:15,280
returning views

5083
04:11:15,280 --> 04:11:17,280
to make a dollar. Returning

5084
04:11:17,280 --> 04:11:19,280
views for some reason are so

5085
04:11:19,280 --> 04:11:21,280
much more expensive.

5086
04:11:21,280 --> 04:11:23,280
Especially in the ASMR side of things.

5087
04:11:23,280 --> 04:11:25,280
I'm gonna do shorts about it and show you

5088
04:11:25,280 --> 04:11:27,280
cause I was gonna do like a

5089
04:11:27,280 --> 04:11:29,280
clickbait short that's like

5090
04:11:29,280 --> 04:11:31,280
ah, how much the ASMR

5091
04:11:31,280 --> 04:11:33,280
can obviously show my income cause

5092
04:11:33,280 --> 04:11:35,280
um...

5093
04:11:35,280 --> 04:11:37,280
I fucking hate gatekeeping knowledge.

5094
04:11:37,280 --> 04:11:39,280
Um, so...

5095
04:11:39,280 --> 04:11:41,280
Now I'm missing this one.

5096
04:11:45,280 --> 04:11:47,280
Uh...

5097
04:11:49,280 --> 04:11:51,280
Oh there it is. Um...

5098
04:11:51,280 --> 04:11:53,280
Yeah, I was gonna

5099
04:11:53,280 --> 04:11:55,280
talk about all that. Oh my god, we have

5100
04:11:55,280 --> 04:11:57,280
a farm! Oh, we have

5101
04:11:57,280 --> 04:11:59,280
our little sprite ones and

5102
04:11:59,280 --> 04:12:01,280
our bobber sprite map.

5103
04:12:01,280 --> 04:12:03,280
That's so cute.

5104
04:12:03,280 --> 04:12:05,280
Oh my god, forget the farm, Arthur. We're just gonna

5105
04:12:05,280 --> 04:12:07,280
beg again.

5106
04:12:07,280 --> 04:12:09,280
The farm's already made, we just need to take over

5107
04:12:09,280 --> 04:12:11,280
it. What are they gonna do?

5108
04:12:11,280 --> 04:12:13,280
Shoot us?

5109
04:12:13,280 --> 04:12:15,280
Oh, look at

5110
04:12:15,280 --> 04:12:17,280
our crop harvest this year.

5111
04:12:17,280 --> 04:12:19,280
This one is so bountiful.

5112
04:12:25,280 --> 04:12:27,280
It's like coming together.

5113
04:12:27,280 --> 04:12:29,280
I don't want to jinx it, but

5114
04:12:29,280 --> 04:12:31,280
coming together.

5115
04:12:31,280 --> 04:12:33,280
Coming together.

5116
04:12:33,280 --> 04:12:35,280
That's why I hate you two.

5117
04:12:35,280 --> 04:12:37,280
Thank you so much for the tip.

5118
04:12:39,280 --> 04:12:41,280
It's very bizarre.

5119
04:12:41,280 --> 04:12:43,280
It doesn't click on an ad to give

5120
04:12:43,280 --> 04:12:45,280
extra revenue to.

5121
04:12:45,280 --> 04:12:47,280
It has to be legitimate.

5122
04:12:47,280 --> 04:12:49,280
Now, this is how bad that data tracking

5123
04:12:49,280 --> 04:12:51,280
and shit has gone.

5124
04:12:51,280 --> 04:12:53,280
If you were to, in theory,

5125
04:12:53,280 --> 04:12:55,280
click on ads on me all the time, but

5126
04:12:55,280 --> 04:12:57,280
no one else.

5127
04:12:57,280 --> 04:12:59,280
The algorithm fucking knows what you're

5128
04:12:59,280 --> 04:13:01,280
up to and will not

5129
04:13:01,280 --> 04:13:03,280
null and void it.

5130
04:13:03,280 --> 04:13:05,280
So, obviously, don't do that.

5131
04:13:05,280 --> 04:13:07,280
I'm not telling you to do that.

5132
04:13:07,280 --> 04:13:09,280
I'm not sure that can get you.

5133
04:13:09,280 --> 04:13:11,280
Right, I need

5134
04:13:11,280 --> 04:13:13,280
eight poopies.

5135
04:13:13,280 --> 04:13:15,280
It's just

5136
04:13:15,280 --> 04:13:17,280
I didn't care what's going on with that ASMR.

5137
04:13:17,280 --> 04:13:19,280
Literally, it's the

5138
04:13:19,280 --> 04:13:21,280
top ten searches

5139
04:13:21,280 --> 04:13:23,280
and they're trying to...

5140
04:13:23,280 --> 04:13:25,280
I don't know if it's just like a public

5141
04:13:25,280 --> 04:13:27,280
action thing and the rules have caught up

5142
04:13:27,280 --> 04:13:29,280
because the public deem ASMR

5143
04:13:29,280 --> 04:13:31,280
p-yop corny.

5144
04:13:31,280 --> 04:13:33,280
But,

5145
04:13:33,280 --> 04:13:35,280
obviously, if you're someone who consumes ASMR

5146
04:13:35,280 --> 04:13:37,280
you know it's not pop corny.

5147
04:13:37,280 --> 04:13:39,280
It's only pop corny

5148
04:13:39,280 --> 04:13:41,280
if you listen to the pop corny

5149
04:13:41,280 --> 04:13:43,280
side of it. You know what I mean?

5150
04:13:43,280 --> 04:13:45,280
That's when

5151
04:13:45,280 --> 04:13:47,280
it's...

5152
04:13:47,280 --> 04:13:49,280
Am I supposed to stick around?

5153
04:13:49,280 --> 04:13:51,280
No.

5154
04:13:51,280 --> 04:13:53,280
I better not be paying attention.

5155
04:13:53,280 --> 04:13:55,280
It's like

5156
04:13:55,280 --> 04:13:57,280
anything. You can type in

5157
04:13:57,280 --> 04:13:59,280
a toaster online

5158
04:13:59,280 --> 04:14:01,280
and it's wholesome.

5159
04:14:01,280 --> 04:14:03,280
But, if you type in

5160
04:14:03,280 --> 04:14:05,280
a toaster doing a backflip on the B

5161
04:14:05,280 --> 04:14:07,280
then, obviously, you're going to get a

5162
04:14:07,280 --> 04:14:09,280
toaster doing a backflip on the B.

5163
04:14:09,280 --> 04:14:11,280
But, unfortunately,

5164
04:14:11,280 --> 04:14:13,280
YouTube has deemed

5165
04:14:13,280 --> 04:14:15,280
pretty much the default

5166
04:14:15,280 --> 04:14:17,280
of ASMR to be

5167
04:14:17,280 --> 04:14:19,280
and their new

5168
04:14:19,280 --> 04:14:21,280
AI on it has been

5169
04:14:21,280 --> 04:14:23,280
running a Mac.

5170
04:14:23,280 --> 04:14:25,280
Running a Mac, I tell you.

5171
04:14:25,280 --> 04:14:27,280
ASMR isn't always.

5172
04:14:27,280 --> 04:14:29,280
No, it's literally

5173
04:14:29,280 --> 04:14:31,280
fucking choose your player. Oh, you chose

5174
04:14:31,280 --> 04:14:33,280
the this? Okay.

5175
04:14:33,280 --> 04:14:35,280
But, now, we will all punish him.

5176
04:14:35,280 --> 04:14:37,280
What is this?

5177
04:14:37,280 --> 04:14:39,280
I'm making a bench that he smokes

5178
04:14:39,280 --> 04:14:41,280
on!

5179
04:14:41,280 --> 04:14:43,280
Wait, is this the sticker?

5180
04:14:43,280 --> 04:14:45,280
I'm to put

5181
04:14:45,280 --> 04:14:47,280
the bench stickers on this?

5182
04:14:49,280 --> 04:14:51,280
I'm

5183
04:14:51,280 --> 04:14:53,280
a bit nervous to

5184
04:14:53,280 --> 04:14:55,280
am I?

5185
04:14:55,280 --> 04:14:57,280
Is that what that means?

5186
04:14:57,280 --> 04:14:59,280
Is it?

5187
04:14:59,280 --> 04:15:01,280
Or is it trying to tell me

5188
04:15:01,280 --> 04:15:03,280
it's a bench? No,

5189
04:15:03,280 --> 04:15:05,280
these are not...

5190
04:15:05,280 --> 04:15:07,280
Hmm...

5191
04:15:07,280 --> 04:15:09,280
Well,

5192
04:15:09,280 --> 04:15:11,280
you know what? If it is a bench, I can stick

5193
04:15:11,280 --> 04:15:13,280
it on. So, actually,

5194
04:15:13,280 --> 04:15:15,280
whoa, these are too long.

5195
04:15:15,280 --> 04:15:17,280
Hmm...

5196
04:15:17,280 --> 04:15:19,280
I need big

5197
04:15:19,280 --> 04:15:21,280
building, big thinking.

5198
04:15:21,280 --> 04:15:23,280
It's literally so hard for me

5199
04:15:23,280 --> 04:15:25,280
to talk and do this at the same time.

5200
04:15:25,280 --> 04:15:27,280
I'm so sorry if you feel a bit ignored

5201
04:15:27,280 --> 04:15:29,280
in chat today. I do apologize.

5202
04:15:29,280 --> 04:15:31,280
I'm trying to glance up every so often.

5203
04:15:31,280 --> 04:15:33,280
But, like, unironically,

5204
04:15:33,280 --> 04:15:35,280
the longer I glance up,

5205
04:15:35,280 --> 04:15:37,280
the more

5206
04:15:37,280 --> 04:15:39,280
I'm going to be

5207
04:15:39,280 --> 04:15:41,280
taking longer. And I feel like you guys

5208
04:15:41,280 --> 04:15:43,280
have been really patient and I want to polish

5209
04:15:43,280 --> 04:15:45,280
the stream off. I want to polish

5210
04:15:45,280 --> 04:15:47,280
the stream off.

5211
04:15:47,280 --> 04:15:49,280
So I can enjoy it.

5212
04:15:49,280 --> 04:15:51,280
I'll take a picture of it

5213
04:15:51,280 --> 04:15:53,280
finished with my ass in the back.

5214
04:15:53,280 --> 04:15:55,280
Are you squidding me right now?

5215
04:15:55,280 --> 04:15:57,280
Literally, that's how I make it up to you all the time.

5216
04:15:57,280 --> 04:15:59,280
I'm just like...

5217
04:15:59,280 --> 04:16:01,280
Oh.

5218
04:16:07,280 --> 04:16:09,280
It's cool? What?

5219
04:16:09,280 --> 04:16:11,280
To see how cool

5220
04:16:11,280 --> 04:16:13,280
this...

5221
04:16:14,280 --> 04:16:16,280
Sorry, I can't read that last

5222
04:16:16,280 --> 04:16:18,280
word that Brian said in that sentence.

5223
04:16:23,280 --> 04:16:24,280
Oh, there it is.

5224
04:16:24,280 --> 04:16:25,280
It's boring.

5225
04:16:25,280 --> 04:16:27,280
Thank you, tiny, tiny, for the kit.

5226
04:16:27,280 --> 04:16:29,280
This being the latest...

5227
04:16:29,280 --> 04:16:31,280
I think Flashcam is one of the

5228
04:16:31,280 --> 04:16:33,280
streamers I've ever been to, given it about to date.

5229
04:16:33,280 --> 04:16:35,280
I mean, no, I haven't fucking helped.

5230
04:16:35,280 --> 04:16:37,280
But, um...

5231
04:16:39,280 --> 04:16:41,280
What the fuck did I do now?

5232
04:16:42,280 --> 04:16:44,280
Right, and then do that.

5233
04:16:44,280 --> 04:16:46,280
And then put the bench down where?

5234
04:16:50,280 --> 04:16:52,280
This?

5235
04:16:53,280 --> 04:16:55,280
One, two, three, four,

5236
04:16:55,280 --> 04:16:57,280
from the grave. One, two, three,

5237
04:16:57,280 --> 04:16:59,280
and then on the fourth one

5238
04:16:59,280 --> 04:17:01,280
the bench begins.

5239
04:17:01,280 --> 04:17:03,280
Okay.

5240
04:17:03,280 --> 04:17:05,280
Oh my god, that's so cute!

5241
04:17:07,280 --> 04:17:09,280
Oh, I love it.

5242
04:17:09,280 --> 04:17:11,280
I love it.

5243
04:17:11,280 --> 04:17:13,280
It's so fucking cool, ain't it?

5244
04:17:13,280 --> 04:17:15,280
I love it.

5245
04:17:15,280 --> 04:17:17,280
I love it. I love it. I love it.

5246
04:17:17,280 --> 04:17:19,280
Flower time!

5247
04:17:19,280 --> 04:17:21,280
Okay, come, come here though.

5248
04:17:21,280 --> 04:17:23,280
Right, what do we need? We need two red...

5249
04:17:23,280 --> 04:17:25,280
No, one red.

5250
04:17:25,280 --> 04:17:27,280
Two, wait.

5251
04:17:27,280 --> 04:17:29,280
One more ninja stars.

5252
04:17:29,280 --> 04:17:31,280
Starlight, ninja.

5253
04:17:31,280 --> 04:17:33,280
And then we need five stops.

5254
04:17:35,280 --> 04:17:37,280
Oh my god, this is just like the

5255
04:17:37,280 --> 04:17:39,280
Lego games.

5256
04:17:39,280 --> 04:17:41,280
I didn't know they did them like this.

5257
04:17:41,280 --> 04:17:43,280
And that's where the Lego games

5258
04:17:43,280 --> 04:17:45,280
got the easy thing from.

5259
04:17:45,280 --> 04:17:47,280
It's not about the end thoughts,

5260
04:17:47,280 --> 04:17:49,280
it's about spending time yapping.

5261
04:17:49,280 --> 04:17:51,280
I mean, if you don't mind the yapping,

5262
04:17:51,280 --> 04:17:53,280
I'm sure I'll take my time, but I just...

5263
04:17:53,280 --> 04:17:55,280
I feel like...

5264
04:17:55,280 --> 04:17:57,280
What the fuck?

5265
04:17:57,280 --> 04:17:59,280
Wait, how do I combine these? Hold on.

5266
04:18:07,280 --> 04:18:09,280
There's

5267
04:18:09,280 --> 04:18:11,280
four

5268
04:18:11,280 --> 04:18:13,280
flowers

5269
04:18:13,280 --> 04:18:15,280
in three holes.

5270
04:18:19,280 --> 04:18:21,280
Excuse me?

5271
04:18:25,280 --> 04:18:27,280
Not to rip these.

5272
04:18:29,280 --> 04:18:31,280
Uh...

5273
04:18:31,280 --> 04:18:33,280
Can you wake up?

5274
04:18:33,280 --> 04:18:35,280
I really go to fuck the suit.

5275
04:18:36,280 --> 04:18:38,280
Man, I'm having it anymore.

5276
04:18:38,280 --> 04:18:40,280
You're not staying up any longer every time.

5277
04:18:40,280 --> 04:18:42,280
Am I supposed to...

5278
04:18:43,280 --> 04:18:45,280
Am I supposed to detach these?

5279
04:18:45,280 --> 04:18:47,280
I am!

5280
04:18:47,280 --> 04:18:49,280
Okay, my apologies.

5281
04:18:51,280 --> 04:18:53,280
Am I?

5282
04:18:53,280 --> 04:18:55,280
I don't know.

5283
04:18:57,280 --> 04:18:59,280
I'm a bleeding heart.

5284
04:18:59,280 --> 04:19:01,280
I live for the only gap session.

5285
04:19:01,280 --> 04:19:03,280
But...

5286
04:19:03,280 --> 04:19:05,280
I'm not to peel these off.

5287
04:19:07,280 --> 04:19:09,280
Hold on.

5288
04:19:09,280 --> 04:19:11,280
Mommy's having a stroke.

5289
04:19:11,280 --> 04:19:13,280
You cannot evade her love for who you have.

5290
04:19:13,280 --> 04:19:15,280
Um...

5291
04:19:15,280 --> 04:19:17,280
I love you boys so much.

5292
04:19:17,280 --> 04:19:19,280
Oh, thank you.

5293
04:19:19,280 --> 04:19:21,280
Um...

5294
04:19:21,280 --> 04:19:23,280
Oh! Okay.

5295
04:19:23,280 --> 04:19:25,280
Ah.

5296
04:19:25,280 --> 04:19:27,280
Okay.

5297
04:19:27,280 --> 04:19:29,280
Okay.

5298
04:19:30,280 --> 04:19:32,280
I fell watching.

5299
04:19:32,280 --> 04:19:35,280
I've been waiting.

5300
04:19:35,280 --> 04:19:38,280
From the shadows.

5301
04:19:41,280 --> 04:19:44,280
Come take me home.

5302
04:19:44,280 --> 04:19:46,280
I'm sorry about the shadow cast.

5303
04:19:46,280 --> 04:19:47,280
I hope that doesn't annoy anyone.

5304
04:19:47,280 --> 04:19:49,280
I literally don't know how to sleep.

5305
04:19:49,280 --> 04:19:52,280
Other than blending as old,

5306
04:19:52,280 --> 04:19:55,280
I opted not to.

5307
04:19:55,280 --> 04:19:57,280
Right, okay.

5308
04:19:57,280 --> 04:19:59,280
There's a flower...

5309
04:20:01,280 --> 04:20:03,280
Dog?

5310
04:20:03,280 --> 04:20:05,280
Okay.

5311
04:20:05,280 --> 04:20:07,280
Oh my god, that's so cute.

5312
04:20:09,280 --> 04:20:11,280
I'm going to cream my little palms with this.

5313
04:20:11,280 --> 04:20:13,280
Mommy's going to need that.

5314
04:20:13,280 --> 04:20:15,280
That is so cute.

5315
04:20:15,280 --> 04:20:17,280
Thank you so much for giving it to me.

5316
04:20:17,280 --> 04:20:19,280
I'm your little streamer dog.

5317
04:20:19,280 --> 04:20:21,280
Please, I'll do anything.

5318
04:20:21,280 --> 04:20:23,280
This is so nice. Thank you.

5319
04:20:23,280 --> 04:20:25,280
Coconut bombs.

5320
04:20:25,280 --> 04:20:27,280
Oh, uh...

5321
04:20:27,280 --> 04:20:30,280
Will there be a new member for Gen 2?

5322
04:20:30,280 --> 04:20:31,280
What?

5323
04:20:31,280 --> 04:20:34,280
Will there be a new member for Gen 2?

5324
04:20:34,280 --> 04:20:38,280
You mean the six new girls in the next generation?

5325
04:20:38,280 --> 04:20:39,280
Uh, yeah.

5326
04:20:39,280 --> 04:20:41,280
Yeah, there's going to be a few more girls.

5327
04:20:41,280 --> 04:20:43,280
Thank you, Coconut.

5328
04:20:43,280 --> 04:20:45,280
For your...

5329
04:20:45,280 --> 04:20:46,280
Your monies.

5330
04:20:46,280 --> 04:20:48,280
Did I misunderstand what you asked?

5331
04:20:48,280 --> 04:20:50,280
Or did you not mean to ask that?

5332
04:20:50,280 --> 04:20:51,280
Good to know.

5333
04:20:51,280 --> 04:20:52,280
Wait, type in...

5334
04:20:52,280 --> 04:20:54,280
Did you accidentally say the wrong thing?

5335
04:20:54,280 --> 04:20:57,280
Oh, like how Gen 1's all me?

5336
04:20:57,280 --> 04:20:59,280
Oh, yes, I forgot about that.

5337
04:20:59,280 --> 04:21:01,280
Hi, Tata.

5338
04:21:01,280 --> 04:21:04,280
Did you like my DJing skills?

5339
04:21:06,280 --> 04:21:08,280
I can't wait to show you my poetry

5340
04:21:08,280 --> 04:21:13,280
because I actually didn't notice about Snowy.

5341
04:21:13,280 --> 04:21:15,280
Little Snowy Icy Pulse,

5342
04:21:15,280 --> 04:21:20,280
that she is creative like that.

5343
04:21:20,280 --> 04:21:21,280
I didn't know,

5344
04:21:21,280 --> 04:21:25,280
and I think her voice is extra adorable.

5345
04:21:25,280 --> 04:21:29,280
And I have no idea what kind of poetry

5346
04:21:29,280 --> 04:21:30,280
she has done,

5347
04:21:30,280 --> 04:21:32,280
but it seems like interest for her

5348
04:21:32,280 --> 04:21:35,280
which is extra-extra-ty.

5349
04:21:35,280 --> 04:21:37,280
Remember Risa?

5350
04:21:37,280 --> 04:21:40,280
They are all me.

5351
04:21:40,280 --> 04:21:44,280
Sorry about the donathon delay.

5352
04:21:44,280 --> 04:21:46,280
I am working very hard.

5353
04:21:46,280 --> 04:21:48,280
Actually, I will say one thing.

5354
04:21:48,280 --> 04:21:50,280
Someone messaged the website

5355
04:21:50,280 --> 04:21:51,280
and we were like,

5356
04:21:51,280 --> 04:21:52,280
where's my rewards?

5357
04:21:52,280 --> 04:21:53,280
We haven't started them yet.

5358
04:21:53,280 --> 04:21:55,280
We are waiting for the bleeding hearts

5359
04:21:55,280 --> 04:21:57,280
to finalize their names.

5360
04:21:57,280 --> 04:21:59,280
And then Azura is getting sent

5361
04:21:59,280 --> 04:22:01,280
a list of all the doodles she has to do,

5362
04:22:01,280 --> 04:22:06,280
so good luck to her in godspeed

5363
04:22:06,280 --> 04:22:10,280
because that's gonna suck for a while.

5364
04:22:10,280 --> 04:22:12,280
But she's gonna do really well.

5365
04:22:17,280 --> 04:22:19,280
And she's gonna do the kissing audio

5366
04:22:19,280 --> 04:22:23,280
and I'm in that I think.

5367
04:22:23,280 --> 04:22:28,280
Just for quickness's sake.

5368
04:22:28,280 --> 04:22:29,280
She's doing really well

5369
04:22:29,280 --> 04:22:35,280
tackling the donathon with her streams.

5370
04:22:35,280 --> 04:22:36,280
Although she's yapping,

5371
04:22:36,280 --> 04:22:37,280
speaking of yapping,

5372
04:22:37,280 --> 04:22:38,280
she's yapping so much

5373
04:22:38,280 --> 04:22:42,280
that she's not finishing her goal on stream,

5374
04:22:42,280 --> 04:22:43,280
which means it'll take longer

5375
04:22:43,280 --> 04:22:45,280
for it to be fulfilled,

5376
04:22:45,280 --> 04:22:48,280
which I'm trying to repeat them.

5377
04:22:48,280 --> 04:22:49,280
Sorry, sorry.

5378
04:22:49,280 --> 04:22:50,280
My hands went in the frame.

5379
04:22:50,280 --> 04:22:53,280
I'm trying to avoid repeating the mistakes

5380
04:22:53,280 --> 04:22:57,280
that we have seen from other agencies.

5381
04:22:57,280 --> 04:23:02,280
And like I'm actually about to propose

5382
04:23:02,280 --> 04:23:07,280
she these finalized donathons.

5383
04:23:07,280 --> 04:23:08,280
And if she agrees to it,

5384
04:23:08,280 --> 04:23:12,280
then in the wise words of the coconut,

5385
04:23:12,280 --> 04:23:15,280
let's get to it.

5386
04:23:15,280 --> 04:23:17,280
Shibi's also gonna be doing

5387
04:23:17,280 --> 04:23:20,280
some of her rewards in advance,

5388
04:23:20,280 --> 04:23:24,280
so I'll quit.

5389
04:23:24,280 --> 04:23:25,280
I'll see how it goes.

5390
04:23:25,280 --> 04:23:29,280
I think she's actually getting a new piece.

5391
04:23:29,280 --> 04:23:32,280
Mummy's proposing to Shibi.

5392
04:23:32,280 --> 04:23:35,280
I propose the thing,

5393
04:23:35,280 --> 04:23:36,280
the donathon.

5394
04:23:36,280 --> 04:23:37,280
Here's your award.

5395
04:23:37,280 --> 04:23:39,280
It's exciting because I've asked the girls,

5396
04:23:39,280 --> 04:23:43,280
I said, it really, it really does my go-in.

5397
04:23:43,280 --> 04:23:45,280
There, there's some scots for you.

5398
04:23:45,280 --> 04:23:51,280
It does my go-in when it is a donathon

5399
04:23:51,280 --> 04:23:53,280
and there's like big, massive gaps

5400
04:23:53,280 --> 04:23:55,280
in between my off-stones.

5401
04:23:55,280 --> 04:23:58,280
It hurts my soul so much.

5402
04:23:58,280 --> 04:23:59,280
I'm just like,

5403
04:23:59,280 --> 04:24:00,280
you can't think of anything

5404
04:24:00,280 --> 04:24:03,280
between 7,000 US dollars that you could do.

5405
04:24:03,280 --> 04:24:05,280
Not even a fucking quick ASMR.

5406
04:24:05,280 --> 04:24:08,280
Like, come on.

5407
04:24:08,280 --> 04:24:11,280
I'm so mad I didn't find Vela

5408
04:24:11,280 --> 04:24:13,280
until after the donathon.

5409
04:24:13,280 --> 04:24:16,280
Is that how you found her on her birthday?

5410
04:24:16,280 --> 04:24:19,280
That's nice, though,

5411
04:24:19,280 --> 04:24:24,280
that you got to find her at such a good time, though.

5412
04:24:24,280 --> 04:24:30,280
So she's gonna be moving out soon to you.

5413
04:24:30,280 --> 04:24:32,280
I don't know what the shirt you're wearing,

5414
04:24:32,280 --> 04:24:33,280
she knows.

5415
04:24:33,280 --> 04:24:35,280
Right, we need five poopy studs

5416
04:24:35,280 --> 04:24:38,280
and ten blocks,

5417
04:24:38,280 --> 04:24:41,280
which is all in here.

5418
04:24:41,280 --> 04:24:44,280
Blocks with a gap, see?

5419
04:24:44,280 --> 04:24:48,280
Blocks are good.

5420
04:24:48,280 --> 04:24:50,280
My eyes cannot see.

5421
04:24:50,280 --> 04:24:52,280
Right, let's do the poopy studs first

5422
04:24:52,280 --> 04:24:57,280
because those are super easy to identify.

5423
04:24:57,280 --> 04:24:58,280
Mia's sheevy's next,

5424
04:24:58,280 --> 04:25:00,280
and then I'm after sheevy

5425
04:25:00,280 --> 04:25:03,280
and then thankfully there's a big old gap

5426
04:25:03,280 --> 04:25:08,280
between anyone else at Vela

5427
04:25:08,280 --> 04:25:13,280
or something that does some creative things

5428
04:25:13,280 --> 04:25:14,280
behind the scenes,

5429
04:25:14,280 --> 04:25:15,280
and then I'll have to start preparing

5430
04:25:15,280 --> 04:25:17,280
for the other girls as well

5431
04:25:17,280 --> 04:25:19,280
and planning all their stuff for them,

5432
04:25:19,280 --> 04:25:21,280
making it super easy

5433
04:25:21,280 --> 04:25:23,280
because you need to enable your talents.

5434
04:25:23,280 --> 04:25:25,280
Hold on, I've got an eyelash on my eyeball.

5435
04:25:25,280 --> 04:25:29,280
I'm going down.

5436
04:25:29,280 --> 04:25:32,280
Mummy, are we gonna watch the trilogy of Austin?

5437
04:25:32,280 --> 04:25:34,280
I have no idea.

5438
04:25:34,280 --> 04:25:35,280
I don't know what I'm getting into

5439
04:25:35,280 --> 04:25:36,280
if I'm being honest.

5440
04:25:36,280 --> 04:25:39,280
I have no idea what I'm getting into.

5441
04:25:39,280 --> 04:25:42,280
What is that?

5442
04:25:42,280 --> 04:25:50,280
I genuinely cannot tell.

5443
04:25:50,280 --> 04:25:54,280
Sorry, I'm needing to look at it.

5444
04:25:54,280 --> 04:25:56,280
My glasses.

5445
04:25:56,280 --> 04:25:57,280
I can find my glasses

5446
04:25:57,280 --> 04:25:58,280
and I refuse to wear them

5447
04:25:58,280 --> 04:26:00,280
because I can't be bothered

5448
04:26:00,280 --> 04:26:02,280
going through the headache of the three days

5449
04:26:02,280 --> 04:26:06,280
it takes for your eyes to adjust.

5450
04:26:06,280 --> 04:26:07,280
My glasses.

5451
04:26:07,280 --> 04:26:11,280
We need ten of these ones.

5452
04:26:11,280 --> 04:26:12,280
We're getting there then.

5453
04:26:12,280 --> 04:26:14,280
We're cooking them.

5454
04:26:14,280 --> 04:26:16,280
You just listen to me.

5455
04:26:16,280 --> 04:26:17,280
No, not that one.

5456
04:26:17,280 --> 04:26:19,280
That's a whole.

5457
04:26:19,280 --> 04:26:21,280
Wait, how many is that?

5458
04:26:21,280 --> 04:26:24,280
Three, six, nine.

5459
04:26:24,280 --> 04:26:25,280
The goose drank wine.

5460
04:26:25,280 --> 04:26:27,280
The monkey's in the back.

5461
04:26:27,280 --> 04:26:28,280
Doing something.

5462
04:26:28,280 --> 04:26:29,280
You can't remember the words.

5463
04:26:29,280 --> 04:26:34,280
And then it's soil, soil, soil, soil, soil.

5464
04:26:34,280 --> 04:26:38,280
The poop's dead in the soil.

5465
04:26:38,280 --> 04:26:40,280
Wait, what?

5466
04:26:40,280 --> 04:26:42,280
Oh, okay.

5467
04:26:42,280 --> 04:26:45,280
One.

5468
04:26:45,280 --> 04:26:46,280
Two.

5469
04:26:46,280 --> 04:26:47,280
Oh, you can't see it.

5470
04:26:47,280 --> 04:26:48,280
Oh, no, you can.

5471
04:26:48,280 --> 04:26:52,280
Oh, jeez.

5472
04:26:52,280 --> 04:26:54,280
The fashion on my face.

5473
04:26:54,280 --> 04:26:55,280
Is that accident yet?

5474
04:26:55,280 --> 04:26:58,280
Or have I been behaving somehow?

5475
04:26:58,280 --> 04:27:00,280
Behaving.

5476
04:27:00,280 --> 04:27:02,280
I just knew it was going to be happening on the screen

5477
04:27:02,280 --> 04:27:05,280
and I was like, all right, here we go.

5478
04:27:05,280 --> 04:27:08,280
A long time, you see?

5479
04:27:08,280 --> 04:27:11,280
A long time, you see?

5480
04:27:11,280 --> 04:27:12,280
Yeah, I'm stressed.

5481
04:27:12,280 --> 04:27:15,280
Those are two.

5482
04:27:15,280 --> 04:27:17,280
No, you're being rude.

5483
04:27:17,280 --> 04:27:18,280
Come on, I'm bringing them.

5484
04:27:18,280 --> 04:27:19,280
Come on.

5485
04:27:19,280 --> 04:27:21,280
I was one of the slow responders.

5486
04:27:21,280 --> 04:27:23,280
Oh, you were a slow fucking responder.

5487
04:27:23,280 --> 04:27:26,280
There was like five people,

5488
04:27:26,280 --> 04:27:28,280
but management did a tweet

5489
04:27:28,280 --> 04:27:31,280
and they were like, bro, if you don't reply,

5490
04:27:31,280 --> 04:27:33,280
you're getting, we're just going to assume

5491
04:27:33,280 --> 04:27:34,280
you don't want the reward

5492
04:27:34,280 --> 04:27:38,280
because we actually, surprisingly,

5493
04:27:38,280 --> 04:27:40,280
got a few people replied back and said,

5494
04:27:40,280 --> 04:27:42,280
nah, yeah, I don't want anything.

5495
04:27:42,280 --> 04:27:43,280
Knock yourself out.

5496
04:27:43,280 --> 04:27:47,280
And I was like, oh, what an absolute child.

5497
04:27:47,280 --> 04:27:50,280
Which I found surprising because I'm like, oh, well,

5498
04:27:50,280 --> 04:27:53,280
I don't know if I can send a generic version

5499
04:27:53,280 --> 04:27:55,280
of the reward at least just to be like,

5500
04:27:55,280 --> 04:27:57,280
we've got something out of it because I mean,

5501
04:27:57,280 --> 04:28:00,280
shoot, you've fucking funded a zero moving out,

5502
04:28:00,280 --> 04:28:03,280
which is really big.

5503
04:28:03,280 --> 04:28:06,280
And it's not like a...

5504
04:28:06,280 --> 04:28:08,280
Oh, sorry.

5505
04:28:08,280 --> 04:28:11,280
Oh, I've knocked that over, that white flower.

5506
04:28:11,280 --> 04:28:14,280
Sorry, Mr. Flower.

5507
04:28:14,280 --> 04:28:17,280
Please go in the ground.

5508
04:28:17,280 --> 04:28:20,280
Please aim for the correct tile.

5509
04:28:20,280 --> 04:28:22,280
Thank you.

5510
04:28:22,280 --> 04:28:26,280
Well, we get the generic reward.

5511
04:28:26,280 --> 04:28:27,280
Yes.

5512
04:28:27,280 --> 04:28:28,280
And that was another thing.

5513
04:28:28,280 --> 04:28:30,280
I wanted them to be public rewards,

5514
04:28:30,280 --> 04:28:33,280
not like, these rewards only accessible first.

5515
04:28:33,280 --> 04:28:36,280
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

5516
04:28:36,280 --> 04:28:38,280
And then I need to deal.

5517
04:28:38,280 --> 04:28:40,280
I have refunds that are members.

5518
04:28:40,280 --> 04:28:42,280
We'll do another membership stream about my donor fund

5519
04:28:42,280 --> 04:28:44,280
and we'll try and get it finalized

5520
04:28:44,280 --> 04:28:48,280
and then I can start working on the rewards

5521
04:28:48,280 --> 04:28:50,280
way before.

5522
04:28:50,280 --> 04:28:53,280
And because...

5523
04:28:53,280 --> 04:28:56,280
I'm gonna be a mighty king

5524
04:28:56,280 --> 04:28:59,280
so enemies beware.

5525
04:28:59,280 --> 04:29:02,280
I've never seen a king or two

5526
04:29:02,280 --> 04:29:05,280
with quite so little hair.

5527
04:29:05,280 --> 04:29:08,280
And I'd be the man of the...

5528
04:29:08,280 --> 04:29:12,280
man of the forest.

5529
04:29:12,280 --> 04:29:15,280
I'm looking at the brush with paint

5530
04:29:15,280 --> 04:29:18,280
I'm working on my life

5531
04:29:18,280 --> 04:29:21,280
Everybody looks right

5532
04:29:21,280 --> 04:29:24,280
Everybody looks right

5533
04:29:24,280 --> 04:29:27,280
Wherever I'm standing

5534
04:29:27,280 --> 04:29:31,280
I'm standing spotlight

5535
04:29:31,280 --> 04:29:33,280
Oh, sorry, I'm off on one.

5536
04:29:33,280 --> 04:29:36,280
How are we looking?

5537
04:29:36,280 --> 04:29:38,280
Literally makes a woman seem...

5538
04:29:38,280 --> 04:29:40,280
true, leaves, honestly.

5539
04:29:40,280 --> 04:29:42,280
Well, I've had enough.

5540
04:29:42,280 --> 04:29:44,280
I'm just pissed at PayPal

5541
04:29:44,280 --> 04:29:46,280
because you weren't using email.

5542
04:29:46,280 --> 04:29:48,280
Oh, I don't want to, I don't want to.

5543
04:29:48,280 --> 04:29:51,280
We're not actually, like, impatient towards anyone

5544
04:29:51,280 --> 04:29:53,280
or anything for that matter.

5545
04:29:53,280 --> 04:29:56,280
That's not...

5546
04:29:56,280 --> 04:29:59,280
block and then knob.

5547
04:29:59,280 --> 04:30:02,280
Block, knob, stud.

5548
04:30:02,280 --> 04:30:04,280
What a combo.

5549
04:30:04,280 --> 04:30:07,280
Bit of a block, bit of a knob and a bit of a dot.

5550
04:30:07,280 --> 04:30:10,280
Like, why is that?

5551
04:30:10,280 --> 04:30:12,280
It's just sick.

5552
04:30:12,280 --> 04:30:14,280
I'm standing.

5553
04:30:14,280 --> 04:30:17,280
Accurately.

5554
04:30:23,280 --> 04:30:25,280
Sorry, if you heard my stomach there,

5555
04:30:25,280 --> 04:30:27,280
it sounded like I farted.

5556
04:30:27,280 --> 04:30:29,280
If I thought I'd eat, I should.

5557
04:30:29,280 --> 04:30:31,280
Yeah, I might eat more.

5558
04:30:31,280 --> 04:30:34,280
Sorry, my brain's starting to get a bit quiet.

5559
04:30:34,280 --> 04:30:36,280
Come back, brain roll.

5560
04:30:36,280 --> 04:30:38,280
At least you were saying stuff.

5561
04:30:38,280 --> 04:30:40,280
No, brain roll, please.

5562
04:30:40,280 --> 04:30:42,280
Please, I'll be a good girl.

5563
04:30:42,280 --> 04:30:44,280
I'll be a good girl, please.

5564
04:30:44,280 --> 04:30:46,280
You're the only reason I could talk right now

5565
04:30:46,280 --> 04:30:48,280
because I'm trying to fucking do two things at once.

5566
04:30:48,280 --> 04:30:51,280
And it's too much for my brain.

5567
04:30:51,280 --> 04:30:53,280
Okay.

5568
04:30:53,280 --> 04:30:55,280
Come back.

5569
04:30:55,280 --> 04:30:57,280
Please.

5570
04:30:57,280 --> 04:31:00,280
I'm gonna learn from Viagra.

5571
04:31:00,280 --> 04:31:02,280
Why is that the first...

5572
04:31:02,280 --> 04:31:04,280
What? Call it a bonathon?

5573
04:31:04,280 --> 04:31:06,280
Okay, that's not the first one yet.

5574
04:31:06,280 --> 04:31:10,280
Welcome to my bonathon.

5575
04:31:10,280 --> 04:31:12,280
Everything is...

5576
04:31:12,280 --> 04:31:15,280
Bokuwa set.

5577
04:31:20,280 --> 04:31:21,280
Oh my god.

5578
04:31:21,280 --> 04:31:24,280
We still have all of this one to go as well.

5579
04:31:26,280 --> 04:31:29,280
I think I'm gonna keep going,

5580
04:31:29,280 --> 04:31:32,280
but if it gets to really pernickety details

5581
04:31:32,280 --> 04:31:34,280
that aren't a thing,

5582
04:31:34,280 --> 04:31:37,280
I might just wrap it up.

5583
04:31:40,280 --> 04:31:42,280
Wrap it up.

5584
04:31:43,280 --> 04:31:47,280
Because my brain's getting tired

5585
04:31:47,280 --> 04:31:50,280
and my tongue's hunched.

5586
04:31:50,280 --> 04:31:53,280
And my hands are cold

5587
04:31:53,280 --> 04:31:57,280
and I'm on my knees

5588
04:31:57,280 --> 04:32:02,280
looking for the answers

5589
04:32:02,280 --> 04:32:06,280
all the way through

5590
04:32:06,280 --> 04:32:09,280
all the way through

5591
04:32:09,280 --> 04:32:11,280
If I fuck you again.

5592
04:32:16,280 --> 04:32:18,280
No, I'm not fucking fucking...

5593
04:32:18,280 --> 04:32:20,280
Sometimes.

5594
04:32:20,280 --> 04:32:22,280
Oh.

5595
04:32:22,280 --> 04:32:24,280
Common.

5596
04:32:25,280 --> 04:32:27,280
You'd rather call it your mum,

5597
04:32:27,280 --> 04:32:30,280
I wouldn't mind if I were eating that.

5598
04:32:30,280 --> 04:32:32,280
I don't know.

5599
04:32:32,280 --> 04:32:35,280
I'm kind of blitzing through a few of the pages.

5600
04:32:35,280 --> 04:32:37,280
And...

5601
04:32:37,280 --> 04:32:39,280
I just don't...

5602
04:32:39,280 --> 04:32:41,280
I don't want to be left unsatisfied.

5603
04:32:41,280 --> 04:32:44,280
I don't want you to have blue balls, okay?

5604
04:32:44,280 --> 04:32:47,280
I mean, we're so close to greatness.

5605
04:32:47,280 --> 04:32:49,280
So close.

5606
04:32:49,280 --> 04:32:52,280
I need smooth beans.

5607
04:32:53,280 --> 04:32:56,280
Just like my head.

5608
04:32:57,280 --> 04:32:59,280
I have two long...

5609
04:32:59,280 --> 04:33:01,280
Okay, that's what I need.

5610
04:33:01,280 --> 04:33:02,280
Two long beans.

5611
04:33:02,280 --> 04:33:05,280
One smooth wee beans.

5612
04:33:05,280 --> 04:33:07,280
Smooth wee beans.

5613
04:33:07,280 --> 04:33:09,280
Smooth.

5614
04:33:09,280 --> 04:33:10,280
Whacked.

5615
04:33:10,280 --> 04:33:12,280
But it's just this petan.

5616
04:33:12,280 --> 04:33:14,280
Okay, we love petan.

5617
04:33:15,280 --> 04:33:18,280
You need to get a deal of bone too.

5618
04:33:18,280 --> 04:33:20,280
I was fricking raging, by the way.

5619
04:33:20,280 --> 04:33:25,280
I fucking bought the collars at full price

5620
04:33:25,280 --> 04:33:29,280
and then the company that I bought them for

5621
04:33:29,280 --> 04:33:31,280
were like, here's a code for 50% off.

5622
04:33:31,280 --> 04:33:33,280
I'm like, I could have fucking used that

5623
04:33:33,280 --> 04:33:35,280
before the order, you twat.

5624
04:33:35,280 --> 04:33:37,280
I know, obviously, just like,

5625
04:33:37,280 --> 04:33:39,280
it just shows you how much of a markup they have

5626
04:33:39,280 --> 04:33:41,280
because they'll still make a profit

5627
04:33:41,280 --> 04:33:43,280
after that 50% is taken off.

5628
04:33:43,280 --> 04:33:45,280
And I'm like, how much do they get fucking scum ass?

5629
04:33:45,280 --> 04:33:47,280
Honestly.

5630
04:33:47,280 --> 04:33:49,280
Honestly, mate.

5631
04:33:49,280 --> 04:33:51,280
Right, this is definitely stickers

5632
04:33:51,280 --> 04:33:53,280
I'm supposed to be putting on.

5633
04:33:58,280 --> 04:34:01,280
I don't think I have the accuracy for stickers.

5634
04:34:03,280 --> 04:34:05,280
Well, I do now, apparently.

5635
04:34:05,280 --> 04:34:07,280
I've fucking done it now.

5636
04:34:07,280 --> 04:34:08,280
Hold on.

5637
04:34:08,280 --> 04:34:10,280
I've done it now.

5638
04:34:14,280 --> 04:34:16,280
Can I put that back on?

5639
04:34:16,280 --> 04:34:18,280
Yeah, I'm gonna just put that one back on

5640
04:34:18,280 --> 04:34:21,280
because what have I done?

5641
04:34:22,280 --> 04:34:24,280
Okay, this is a long sticker,

5642
04:34:24,280 --> 04:34:26,280
so let's take that one.

5643
04:34:27,280 --> 04:34:28,280
Okay.

5644
04:34:28,280 --> 04:34:30,280
Ten years, this has been waiting to be

5645
04:34:30,280 --> 04:34:31,280
stuck onto something.

5646
04:34:31,280 --> 04:34:33,280
Don't fuck it up,

5647
04:34:33,280 --> 04:34:34,280
do you understand?

5648
04:34:34,280 --> 04:34:35,280
Ow!

5649
04:34:35,280 --> 04:34:37,280
No, don't fuck it up.

5650
04:34:37,280 --> 04:34:38,280
Don't fuck it up.

5651
04:34:38,280 --> 04:34:40,280
Don't put your...

5652
04:34:40,280 --> 04:34:42,280
your video up something.

5653
04:34:42,280 --> 04:34:43,280
Oh my god.

5654
04:34:45,280 --> 04:34:46,280
Oh?

5655
04:34:47,280 --> 04:34:48,280
Okay.

5656
04:34:54,280 --> 04:34:55,280
Shit.

5657
04:34:55,280 --> 04:34:56,280
Okay, hold on.

5658
04:34:56,280 --> 04:34:57,280
No!

5659
04:34:59,280 --> 04:35:01,280
How is anyone supposed to...

5660
04:35:01,280 --> 04:35:03,280
Oh, this is my last time.

5661
04:35:04,280 --> 04:35:05,280
Hold on.

5662
04:35:08,280 --> 04:35:10,280
This is like surgery, okay,

5663
04:35:10,280 --> 04:35:12,280
but we were...

5664
04:35:13,280 --> 04:35:15,280
We're coming.

5665
04:35:17,280 --> 04:35:18,280
Oh.

5666
04:35:20,280 --> 04:35:21,280
Shit.

5667
04:35:23,280 --> 04:35:24,280
That'll do.

5668
04:35:25,280 --> 04:35:26,280
That'll do.

5669
04:35:26,280 --> 04:35:28,280
I do not care that much.

5670
04:35:28,280 --> 04:35:30,280
What the fuck?

5671
04:35:30,280 --> 04:35:32,280
Am I actually...

5672
04:35:34,280 --> 04:35:35,280
Like that?

5673
04:35:37,280 --> 04:35:40,280
Okay, give me another shot, I don't know.

5674
04:35:42,280 --> 04:35:44,280
Okay, put it in the right hand,

5675
04:35:44,280 --> 04:35:46,280
because your right hand is for one.

5676
04:35:47,280 --> 04:35:49,280
And then steady your approach.

5677
04:35:51,280 --> 04:35:52,280
Okay.

5678
04:35:52,280 --> 04:35:53,280
Whoa!

5679
04:35:54,280 --> 04:35:56,280
Not bad, almost perfect.

5680
04:35:56,280 --> 04:35:59,280
Almost frame perfect, I'm not kidding.

5681
04:35:59,280 --> 04:36:01,280
That was not bad, that one.

5682
04:36:03,280 --> 04:36:04,280
Rest well, those who sleep.

5683
04:36:04,280 --> 04:36:05,280
That one was...

5684
04:36:05,280 --> 04:36:06,280
That's not funny.

5685
04:36:06,280 --> 04:36:08,280
Don't tell anyone you're fucking driving off the road.

5686
04:36:09,280 --> 04:36:12,280
Okay, and then I put my fence together.

5687
04:36:12,280 --> 04:36:14,280
Wait, where did it start?

5688
04:36:14,280 --> 04:36:15,280
Here.

5689
04:36:15,280 --> 04:36:16,280
Do you know what it's mean?

5690
04:36:16,280 --> 04:36:17,280
No, it's just open.

5691
04:36:22,280 --> 04:36:23,280
Wait, what?

5692
04:36:23,280 --> 04:36:24,280
Hold on.

5693
04:36:28,280 --> 04:36:29,280
Oh, it comes over.

5694
04:36:30,280 --> 04:36:32,280
It doesn't go on this one.

5695
04:36:32,280 --> 04:36:33,280
Some...

5696
04:36:33,280 --> 04:36:34,280
I'm not moving.

5697
04:36:36,280 --> 04:36:37,280
There we go.

5698
04:36:38,280 --> 04:36:41,280
For role-playing purposes, the fence isn't actually a fence.

5699
04:36:42,280 --> 04:36:43,280
What is that?

5700
04:36:44,280 --> 04:36:45,280
What is that?

5701
04:36:45,280 --> 04:36:47,280
Sorry, I just saw my face there.

5702
04:36:53,280 --> 04:36:55,280
I mean, it looks like a front garden.

5703
04:36:57,280 --> 04:36:59,280
I need you and Amy sing a fortnight battle pass.

5704
04:36:59,280 --> 04:37:01,280
Oh, I don't know if it's up here.

5705
04:37:02,280 --> 04:37:04,280
I think there was an update about...

5706
04:37:05,280 --> 04:37:07,280
Music guys, I'm so sorry.

5707
04:37:16,280 --> 04:37:18,280
I'm gonna hear my little sister sing.

5708
04:37:20,280 --> 04:37:22,280
And then this is only one.

5709
04:37:25,280 --> 04:37:26,280
Oh, no.

5710
04:37:26,280 --> 04:37:28,280
Put it in your right hand to do it.

5711
04:37:31,280 --> 04:37:33,280
Is it steady for Freddy?

5712
04:37:34,280 --> 04:37:36,280
Five nights at Freddy's.

5713
04:37:37,280 --> 04:37:40,280
There's only five nights at Freddy's game that came out.

5714
04:37:40,280 --> 04:37:42,280
That's called The Boar Pit.

5715
04:37:43,280 --> 04:37:44,280
It goes...

5716
04:37:44,280 --> 04:37:45,280
Wait.

5717
04:37:45,280 --> 04:37:47,280
There's a scan of...

5718
04:37:51,280 --> 04:37:53,280
I am what...

5719
04:37:53,280 --> 04:37:56,280
How do they say in English?

5720
04:37:57,280 --> 04:37:59,280
A fucking dipshirt.

5721
04:38:00,280 --> 04:38:02,280
Yeah, it's kind of good.

5722
04:38:02,280 --> 04:38:04,280
The end of the ball pit game?

5723
04:38:04,280 --> 04:38:06,280
Yeah, I've seen a lot of each of us jump on it.

5724
04:38:06,280 --> 04:38:10,280
I'm like, damn, does that mean it's accessible to dumbasses like me?

5725
04:38:15,280 --> 04:38:17,280
I'm happy to make music.

5726
04:38:20,280 --> 04:38:21,280
Normal.

5727
04:38:23,280 --> 04:38:24,280
Sensational.

5728
04:38:24,280 --> 04:38:25,280
Sensational.

5729
04:38:33,280 --> 04:38:34,280
I mean, it's messy.

5730
04:38:34,280 --> 04:38:35,280
I do.

5731
04:38:35,280 --> 04:38:36,280
Come on.

5732
04:38:36,280 --> 04:38:38,280
I guess I can be directly into them.

5733
04:38:39,280 --> 04:38:40,280
Pretty true.

5734
04:38:42,280 --> 04:38:44,280
I don't know if anyone can do it.

5735
04:38:45,280 --> 04:38:47,280
I need to start memorizing the schedules so I can be like,

5736
04:38:47,280 --> 04:38:49,280
Oh, this girl is playing this thing.

5737
04:38:49,280 --> 04:38:50,280
This girl is doing this thing.

5738
04:38:50,280 --> 04:38:51,280
Yeah, I know.

5739
04:38:52,280 --> 04:38:53,280
I need a hinge.

5740
04:38:54,280 --> 04:38:55,280
Are we hinge?

5741
04:38:55,280 --> 04:38:57,280
Then what about we hinge in here?

5742
04:38:59,280 --> 04:39:00,280
Are we hinge?

5743
04:39:00,280 --> 04:39:01,280
No, that's a bit...

5744
04:39:02,280 --> 04:39:03,280
A hinge?

5745
04:39:03,280 --> 04:39:04,280
Got a hinge.

5746
04:39:04,280 --> 04:39:05,280
What is that?

5747
04:39:10,280 --> 04:39:12,280
Okay, and then three flat ones.

5748
04:39:12,280 --> 04:39:14,280
One, two,

5749
04:39:16,280 --> 04:39:17,280
three,

5750
04:39:17,280 --> 04:39:19,280
and then two long sticks.

5751
04:39:21,280 --> 04:39:22,280
Two.

5752
04:39:23,280 --> 04:39:24,280
Well, well, well.

5753
04:39:29,280 --> 04:39:31,280
Amy's moving her female back.

5754
04:39:34,280 --> 04:39:37,280
Opinion on corner of the city.

5755
04:39:37,280 --> 04:39:40,280
I used to eat tons of roasted shreddies.

5756
04:39:40,280 --> 04:39:42,280
I wish they had them here, but they couldn't.

5757
04:39:43,280 --> 04:39:45,280
Honestly, I kind of need to move back to school.

5758
04:39:46,280 --> 04:39:47,280
Um,

5759
04:39:51,280 --> 04:39:52,280
the door,

5760
04:39:53,280 --> 04:39:55,280
I just go straight on like this.

5761
04:39:58,280 --> 04:40:00,280
I'm like, how am I going to break it?

5762
04:40:00,280 --> 04:40:03,280
Oh, I'm like, I love when there's like movable pieces.

5763
04:40:06,280 --> 04:40:07,280
Let me try that again.

5764
04:40:12,280 --> 04:40:13,280
Oh, come on.

5765
04:40:13,280 --> 04:40:18,280
Oh, I love when there's like movable pieces.

5766
04:40:18,280 --> 04:40:19,280
Yeah.

5767
04:40:19,280 --> 04:40:22,280
I shouldn't move that much, but there you go.

5768
04:40:25,280 --> 04:40:27,280
Immediately breaks the gate.

5769
04:40:27,280 --> 04:40:28,280
Yeah.

5770
04:40:29,280 --> 04:40:30,280
Pretty much.

5771
04:40:35,280 --> 04:40:37,280
I've got three flat,

5772
04:40:37,280 --> 04:40:39,280
three flat and two long.

5773
04:40:39,280 --> 04:40:40,280
What is that view?

5774
04:40:40,280 --> 04:40:41,280
What is that?

5775
04:40:41,280 --> 04:40:42,280
What is that doing?

5776
04:40:43,280 --> 04:40:45,280
Oh, it makes the fucking sense.

5777
04:40:45,280 --> 04:40:46,280
Okay.

5778
04:40:47,280 --> 04:40:48,280
Excuse me.

5779
04:40:48,280 --> 04:40:50,280
I'm a little less sensitive than it is.

5780
04:40:50,280 --> 04:40:51,280
One.

5781
04:40:51,280 --> 04:40:52,280
Yeah.

5782
04:40:55,280 --> 04:40:56,280
Yeah, work with me.

5783
04:40:56,280 --> 04:40:57,280
Work with me.

5784
04:40:57,280 --> 04:40:58,280
Okay.

5785
04:41:00,280 --> 04:41:03,280
I will have no one laughing at my fucked up.

5786
04:41:03,280 --> 04:41:04,280
Okay.

5787
04:41:04,280 --> 04:41:07,280
And then just like snap it in like that.

5788
04:41:07,280 --> 04:41:08,280
Okay.

5789
04:41:09,280 --> 04:41:13,280
It's a real dance.

5790
04:41:13,280 --> 04:41:14,280
Okay.

5791
04:41:14,280 --> 04:41:15,280
So then.

5792
04:41:16,280 --> 04:41:17,280
What?

5793
04:41:17,280 --> 04:41:18,280
Sorry.

5794
04:41:18,280 --> 04:41:20,280
I'm having to like the light and shine.

5795
04:41:20,280 --> 04:41:21,280
Okay.

5796
04:41:21,280 --> 04:41:22,280
I admit it.

5797
04:41:22,280 --> 04:41:23,280
I admit it.

5798
04:41:23,280 --> 04:41:26,280
The light and shine to put the fucking thing together.

5799
04:41:26,280 --> 04:41:27,280
Like, you can see,

5800
04:41:27,280 --> 04:41:30,280
I'm covering up the wee patches in the fence.

5801
04:41:30,280 --> 04:41:31,280
I mean,

5802
04:41:32,280 --> 04:41:37,280
isn't it more realistic to have a violent beast?

5803
04:41:38,280 --> 04:41:40,280
A violent beast.

5804
04:41:42,280 --> 04:41:43,280
Let's move that one.

5805
04:41:43,280 --> 04:41:44,280
Can you tuck it that way?

5806
04:41:44,280 --> 04:41:45,280
Okay.

5807
04:41:46,280 --> 04:41:47,280
There.

5808
04:41:47,280 --> 04:41:48,280
That's like a fence and a gate.

5809
04:41:48,280 --> 04:41:50,280
And like, it doesn't have to be perfectly straight.

5810
04:41:50,280 --> 04:41:54,280
It looks more authentic because it's all wobbly and stuff.

5811
04:41:55,280 --> 04:41:56,280
Okay.

5812
04:41:56,280 --> 04:41:57,280
Next.

5813
04:41:57,280 --> 04:41:58,280
Of.

5814
04:41:58,280 --> 04:42:01,280
All my fucking iPhones will die.

5815
04:42:01,280 --> 04:42:02,280
Bliet.

5816
04:42:04,280 --> 04:42:05,280
Bliet nachoi.

5817
04:42:05,280 --> 04:42:06,280
Puka.

5818
04:42:07,280 --> 04:42:09,280
I put my iPhone inside.

5819
04:42:10,280 --> 04:42:12,280
If you hear a din din din, that's me.

5820
04:42:15,280 --> 04:42:16,280
I told you that was me.

5821
04:42:16,280 --> 04:42:17,280
Don't know.

5822
04:42:17,280 --> 04:42:19,280
I'm still moving.

5823
04:42:22,280 --> 04:42:25,280
What are some foods from Australia that you feel like?

5824
04:42:26,280 --> 04:42:28,280
It's not that I don't like Aussie food.

5825
04:42:28,280 --> 04:42:29,280
It's just,

5826
04:42:29,280 --> 04:42:33,280
can when you eat a food type and it's always been that way,

5827
04:42:33,280 --> 04:42:36,280
like it's always been the way you've known it.

5828
04:42:37,280 --> 04:42:39,280
That's what I struggle with because I'm like,

5829
04:42:39,280 --> 04:42:41,280
this doesn't taste like,

5830
04:42:41,280 --> 04:42:44,280
like I can't even find fucking cookies that are nice here.

5831
04:42:44,280 --> 04:42:46,280
But it's not because the cookies are like,

5832
04:42:46,280 --> 04:42:50,280
bog in, ming in, absolutely XYZ elemental piece.

5833
04:42:50,280 --> 04:42:53,280
It's because I'm used to cookies being a certain way

5834
04:42:53,280 --> 04:42:55,280
and Aussies have stuff different ways.

5835
04:42:56,280 --> 04:42:57,280
And I'm like,

5836
04:42:59,280 --> 04:43:00,280
Oh my God.

5837
04:43:00,280 --> 04:43:01,280
Why is the

5838
04:43:02,280 --> 04:43:04,280
stalk so long?

5839
04:43:06,280 --> 04:43:07,280
It's like your pintas.

5840
04:43:07,280 --> 04:43:09,280
Your stalk is so long.

5841
04:43:10,280 --> 04:43:11,280
Yeah.

5842
04:43:12,280 --> 04:43:14,280
And then an apple.

5843
04:43:17,280 --> 04:43:19,280
Well, you have the apple in your bowl.

5844
04:43:19,280 --> 04:43:20,280
Okay.

5845
04:43:20,280 --> 04:43:21,280
Then what?

5846
04:43:21,280 --> 04:43:22,280
This goes here.

5847
04:43:22,280 --> 04:43:23,280
Did I fish it down?

5848
04:43:25,280 --> 04:43:26,280
I'll just let it sit there.

5849
04:43:26,280 --> 04:43:27,280
Fuck yeah.

5850
04:43:28,280 --> 04:43:29,280
Look, I ain't here trying to,

5851
04:43:29,280 --> 04:43:31,280
I'm not trying to force anything.

5852
04:43:31,280 --> 04:43:33,280
That doesn't want to be, you know,

5853
04:43:33,280 --> 04:43:35,280
like two coconuts.

5854
04:43:36,280 --> 04:43:38,280
You put the lime and the coconut.

5855
04:43:43,280 --> 04:43:46,280
Have you been able to hold it in the microwave?

5856
04:43:49,280 --> 04:43:50,280
Oh, is this sweet?

5857
04:43:50,280 --> 04:43:51,280
It's not sweet.

5858
04:43:51,280 --> 04:43:52,280
That's why we've got a spell on.

5859
04:43:52,280 --> 04:43:53,280
I've been eating,

5860
04:43:53,280 --> 04:43:55,280
my sweet is

5861
04:43:55,280 --> 04:43:57,280
um,

5862
04:43:57,280 --> 04:43:58,280
Stroopwafel.

5863
04:43:58,280 --> 04:44:01,280
There's like an imported Stroopwafel here.

5864
04:44:01,280 --> 04:44:02,280
And it's, um,

5865
04:44:02,280 --> 04:44:05,280
sorry, I just said it in my accent.

5866
04:44:06,280 --> 04:44:07,280
Oh,

5867
04:44:07,280 --> 04:44:08,280
equal,

5868
04:44:08,280 --> 04:44:09,280
ain't,

5869
04:44:09,280 --> 04:44:10,280
no, ain't,

5870
04:44:10,280 --> 04:44:11,280
equal in

5871
04:44:12,280 --> 04:44:13,280
Stroopwafel.

5872
04:44:13,280 --> 04:44:14,280
Else you bleefed.

5873
04:44:14,280 --> 04:44:15,280
Yeah.

5874
04:44:15,280 --> 04:44:16,280
I'm sorry.

5875
04:44:16,280 --> 04:44:18,280
For the one doctor who's not looking for me.

5876
04:44:19,280 --> 04:44:20,280
Wait, what?

5877
04:44:22,280 --> 04:44:24,280
We're going back to inside.

5878
04:44:24,280 --> 04:44:25,280
Right. Okay.

5879
04:44:28,280 --> 04:44:29,280
What were they?

5880
04:44:36,280 --> 04:44:37,280
Step one.

5881
04:44:37,280 --> 04:44:38,280
Step two.

5882
04:44:38,280 --> 04:44:39,280
Oh, right.

5883
04:44:39,280 --> 04:44:40,280
Okay.

5884
04:44:40,280 --> 04:44:41,280
Okay.

5885
04:44:41,280 --> 04:44:42,280
Okay.

5886
04:44:42,280 --> 04:44:43,280
Sorry.

5887
04:44:43,280 --> 04:44:45,280
I've been like too distracted.

5888
04:44:45,280 --> 04:44:46,280
I'm to

5889
04:44:46,280 --> 04:44:47,280
put it.

5890
04:44:47,280 --> 04:44:48,280
Yeah.

5891
04:44:48,280 --> 04:44:49,280
Right.

5892
04:44:49,280 --> 04:44:50,280
In you comes the,

5893
04:44:50,280 --> 04:44:52,280
I should have done this at an angle.

5894
04:44:52,280 --> 04:44:56,280
And looking at what POV that you see versus like what I see.

5895
04:44:56,280 --> 04:44:57,280
I'm like, yeah,

5896
04:44:57,280 --> 04:44:59,280
I should have had a bit of a

5897
04:45:00,280 --> 04:45:01,280
different setup.

5898
04:45:01,280 --> 04:45:03,280
I apologize.

5899
04:45:03,280 --> 04:45:04,280
I apologize.

5900
04:45:06,280 --> 04:45:07,280
My theory was correct.

5901
04:45:07,280 --> 04:45:09,280
One sweet is important.

5902
04:45:09,280 --> 04:45:11,280
This content is too good not to subscribe for.

5903
04:45:11,280 --> 04:45:12,280
Oh,

5904
04:45:12,280 --> 04:45:13,280
thank you.

5905
04:45:13,280 --> 04:45:16,280
I'm glad you can enjoy me rambling into the void.

5906
04:45:16,280 --> 04:45:17,280
No, no,

5907
04:45:17,280 --> 04:45:18,280
please.

5908
04:45:18,280 --> 04:45:19,280
I'll be here all week.

5909
04:45:20,280 --> 04:45:21,280
Right.

5910
04:45:21,280 --> 04:45:22,280
Bench.

5911
04:45:22,280 --> 04:45:23,280
Bench.

5912
04:45:23,280 --> 04:45:26,280
Little black things with a knob on it.

5913
04:45:27,280 --> 04:45:29,280
Little black thing with a knob on it.

5914
04:45:30,280 --> 04:45:31,280
Uh,

5915
04:45:32,280 --> 04:45:33,280
one

5916
04:45:33,280 --> 04:45:34,280
brown

5917
04:45:34,280 --> 04:45:35,280
two

5918
04:45:35,280 --> 04:45:36,280
things.

5919
04:45:36,280 --> 04:45:37,280
Got it.

5920
04:45:37,280 --> 04:45:39,280
Whatever the fuck that is,

5921
04:45:39,280 --> 04:45:40,280
you know what I mean?

5922
04:45:43,280 --> 04:45:44,280
What was that?

5923
04:45:44,280 --> 04:45:45,280
I don't have that.

5924
04:45:45,280 --> 04:45:46,280
I don't have that.

5925
04:45:50,280 --> 04:45:51,280
My view.

5926
04:45:53,280 --> 04:45:54,280
My bird.

5927
04:45:54,280 --> 04:45:55,280
Again.

5928
04:45:58,280 --> 04:45:59,280
Oh, there is.

5929
04:45:59,280 --> 04:46:00,280
Okay.

5930
04:46:00,280 --> 04:46:01,280
Wrong color.

5931
04:46:01,280 --> 04:46:03,280
I was looking for a certain color.

5932
04:46:03,280 --> 04:46:04,280
I can see it.

5933
04:46:06,280 --> 04:46:07,280
Of course.

5934
04:46:07,280 --> 04:46:09,280
Me too strong in the picture.

5935
04:46:10,280 --> 04:46:11,280
I know.

5936
04:46:11,280 --> 04:46:12,280
I like,

5937
04:46:12,280 --> 04:46:13,280
savory,

5938
04:46:13,280 --> 04:46:14,280
like food wise.

5939
04:46:15,280 --> 04:46:16,280
Strip waffles,

5940
04:46:16,280 --> 04:46:19,280
like two really thin waffles with a layer of thick curry caramel.

5941
04:46:21,280 --> 04:46:22,280
Barbecue gator.

5942
04:46:24,280 --> 04:46:25,280
You're not eating gator.

5943
04:46:25,280 --> 04:46:28,280
Oh, there's kangaroo and the cat food here.

5944
04:46:28,280 --> 04:46:29,280
I was like,

5945
04:46:29,280 --> 04:46:30,280
I was like,

5946
04:46:30,280 --> 04:46:31,280
he'll excuse you.

5947
04:46:31,280 --> 04:46:32,280
Right.

5948
04:46:32,280 --> 04:46:33,280
Inside,

5949
04:46:33,280 --> 04:46:34,280
like this.

5950
04:46:35,280 --> 04:46:36,280
I think of that.

5951
04:46:36,280 --> 04:46:37,280
Ow.

5952
04:46:37,280 --> 04:46:38,280
It's dragging me.

5953
04:46:39,280 --> 04:46:40,280
It's hurting me.

5954
04:46:40,280 --> 04:46:41,280
Okay, then put this in.

5955
04:46:41,280 --> 04:46:42,280
Okay.

5956
04:46:44,280 --> 04:46:45,280
Oh, Jesus.

5957
04:46:45,280 --> 04:46:47,280
What the fuck am I making?

5958
04:46:50,280 --> 04:46:51,280
His writing desk.

5959
04:46:51,280 --> 04:46:52,280
Oh,

5960
04:46:52,280 --> 04:46:55,280
I'm making Bilbo's writing desk.

5961
04:46:55,280 --> 04:46:56,280
Oh,

5962
04:46:56,280 --> 04:46:57,280
that's so cute.

5963
04:46:59,280 --> 04:47:00,280
Oh,

5964
04:47:00,280 --> 04:47:01,280
that's so cool.

5965
04:47:03,280 --> 04:47:04,280
I just clocked.

5966
04:47:04,280 --> 04:47:05,280
Like,

5967
04:47:05,280 --> 04:47:08,280
this looks like his writing desk and then there's his contract to sign.

5968
04:47:08,280 --> 04:47:09,280
Oh,

5969
04:47:09,280 --> 04:47:10,280
please.

5970
04:47:11,280 --> 04:47:12,280
Please.

5971
04:47:12,280 --> 04:47:14,280
My fingers feel like they're falling off

5972
04:47:14,280 --> 04:47:15,280
or my little

5973
04:47:15,280 --> 04:47:16,280
index finger.

5974
04:47:16,280 --> 04:47:18,280
Although it looks like the same color.

5975
04:47:18,280 --> 04:47:19,280
It's like,

5976
04:47:19,280 --> 04:47:20,280
oh my other thing.

5977
04:47:20,280 --> 04:47:21,280
So I guess that cannae bean

5978
04:47:21,280 --> 04:47:22,280
have been that bad.

5979
04:47:22,280 --> 04:47:23,280
Can it have been?

5980
04:47:24,280 --> 04:47:25,280
Oh, come on.

5981
04:47:25,280 --> 04:47:26,280
Oh, come on.

5982
04:47:26,280 --> 04:47:27,280
Right.

5983
04:47:27,280 --> 04:47:28,280
Bilbo's writing desk is made.

5984
04:47:28,280 --> 04:47:29,280
Now what do I do?

5985
04:47:30,280 --> 04:47:31,280
I take a quill,

5986
04:47:31,280 --> 04:47:32,280
a bottle,

5987
04:47:32,280 --> 04:47:33,280
and the boot.

5988
04:47:34,280 --> 04:47:35,280
The boot.

5989
04:47:36,280 --> 04:47:37,280
I put

5990
04:47:37,280 --> 04:47:39,280
the stickers on,

5991
04:47:39,280 --> 04:47:41,280
but it must go a certain way.

5992
04:47:42,280 --> 04:47:43,280
I think

5993
04:47:43,280 --> 04:47:44,280
I already made it.

5994
04:47:44,280 --> 04:47:46,280
I can fall by doing it.

5995
04:47:47,280 --> 04:47:49,280
Let's be careful.

5996
04:47:52,280 --> 04:47:53,280
Yeah.

5997
04:47:54,280 --> 04:47:55,280
Open the book.

5998
04:47:56,280 --> 04:47:57,280
On the right side of the book,

5999
04:47:57,280 --> 04:47:59,280
place this sticker in the picture.

6000
04:48:00,280 --> 04:48:01,280
It's like surgery.

6001
04:48:01,280 --> 04:48:02,280
Beep.

6002
04:48:02,280 --> 04:48:03,280
Beep.

6003
04:48:04,280 --> 04:48:05,280
I'll find the patient, please.

6004
04:48:07,280 --> 04:48:08,280
Oh, fuck.

6005
04:48:09,280 --> 04:48:10,280
Right.

6006
04:48:12,280 --> 04:48:13,280
It was going to rip

6007
04:48:13,280 --> 04:48:14,280
if I pulled it up.

6008
04:48:16,280 --> 04:48:17,280
You need to come at

6009
04:48:17,280 --> 04:48:19,280
or else it'll rip.

6010
04:48:20,280 --> 04:48:21,280
Right there.

6011
04:48:21,280 --> 04:48:22,280
How?

6012
04:48:22,280 --> 04:48:23,280
I don't even know how I made it.

6013
04:48:23,280 --> 04:48:24,280
There's actually,

6014
04:48:24,280 --> 04:48:25,280
but you saw that it worked.

6015
04:48:28,280 --> 04:48:29,280
This is

6016
04:48:29,280 --> 04:48:31,280
not when you bend it.

6017
04:48:31,280 --> 04:48:33,280
The way this diagram shows the book

6018
04:48:33,280 --> 04:48:34,280
closed.

6019
04:48:34,280 --> 04:48:36,280
The book cannot be closed.

6020
04:48:36,280 --> 04:48:38,280
I assure you that thing is not closed

6021
04:48:38,280 --> 04:48:39,280
and not for me,

6022
04:48:39,280 --> 04:48:41,280
not for anything else.

6023
04:48:42,280 --> 04:48:43,280
And then I need his

6024
04:48:43,280 --> 04:48:44,280
other,

6025
04:48:44,280 --> 04:48:46,280
his little writing glass.

6026
04:48:46,280 --> 04:48:47,280
Oh, yeah.

6027
04:48:49,280 --> 04:48:50,280
Okay.

6028
04:48:50,280 --> 04:48:51,280
And then put the quill

6029
04:48:51,280 --> 04:48:52,280
on his new writing glass.

6030
04:48:53,280 --> 04:48:54,280
And then

6031
04:48:54,280 --> 04:48:55,280
take the

6032
04:48:56,280 --> 04:48:57,280
ticket, ticket.

6033
04:48:59,280 --> 04:49:01,280
I'm knuckling to myself again.

6034
04:49:02,280 --> 04:49:04,280
I miss my wife, please.

6035
04:49:05,280 --> 04:49:06,280
How did we do this?

6036
04:49:07,280 --> 04:49:08,280
Oh, no.

6037
04:49:08,280 --> 04:49:09,280
I fucked that book up.

6038
04:49:12,280 --> 04:49:13,280
How am I supposed to

6039
04:49:13,280 --> 04:49:14,280
close the book?

6040
04:49:14,280 --> 04:49:15,280
Am I missing something?

6041
04:49:16,280 --> 04:49:17,280
Other than brain cells,

6042
04:49:17,280 --> 04:49:18,280
am I missing something?

6043
04:49:18,280 --> 04:49:19,280
The book's not closed then.

6044
04:49:20,280 --> 04:49:21,280
Oh.

6045
04:49:22,280 --> 04:49:23,280
Is that breaking?

6046
04:49:24,280 --> 04:49:25,280
Oh, no.

6047
04:49:25,280 --> 04:49:26,280
I want to close it.

6048
04:49:26,280 --> 04:49:27,280
Oh.

6049
04:49:27,280 --> 04:49:28,280
Oh.

6050
04:49:28,280 --> 04:49:29,280
Okay.

6051
04:49:29,280 --> 04:49:30,280
I guess because it's,

6052
04:49:30,280 --> 04:49:31,280
hmm.

6053
04:49:31,280 --> 04:49:32,280
I go.

6054
04:49:32,280 --> 04:49:33,280
I mean, I go.

6055
04:49:34,280 --> 04:49:35,280
I close.

6056
04:49:35,280 --> 04:49:36,280
I close the book.

6057
04:49:36,280 --> 04:49:37,280
Don't worry.

6058
04:49:38,280 --> 04:49:39,280
There's force.

6059
04:49:40,280 --> 04:49:41,280
There's such a man we fling.

6060
04:49:42,280 --> 04:49:43,280
Of course, the first thing you

6061
04:49:43,280 --> 04:49:44,280
would say is,

6062
04:49:44,280 --> 04:49:45,280
there's force.

6063
04:49:46,280 --> 04:49:47,280
What did that book?

6064
04:49:47,280 --> 04:49:48,280
Wait, where's the book?

6065
04:49:48,280 --> 04:49:49,280
There's a text.

6066
04:49:58,280 --> 04:49:59,280
Hello.

6067
04:49:59,280 --> 04:50:00,280
Hello.

6068
04:50:01,280 --> 04:50:02,280
Oh.

6069
04:50:04,280 --> 04:50:05,280
Are you squidding me right now?

6070
04:50:06,280 --> 04:50:07,280
Yeah.

6071
04:50:07,280 --> 04:50:08,280
Deep fried Cajun seasoned

6072
04:50:08,280 --> 04:50:10,280
gator tail is a delicacy.

6073
04:50:10,280 --> 04:50:12,280
Deep fried Cajun seasoned

6074
04:50:12,280 --> 04:50:14,280
gator tail is a delicacy?

6075
04:50:14,280 --> 04:50:15,280
Oh, yeah.

6076
04:50:15,280 --> 04:50:16,280
Thank you, David.

6077
04:50:18,280 --> 04:50:19,280
Hmm.

6078
04:50:20,280 --> 04:50:21,280
Uh.

6079
04:50:22,280 --> 04:50:23,280
Lime on Easter

6080
04:50:23,280 --> 04:50:25,280
tend to make sense.

6081
04:50:25,280 --> 04:50:27,280
She's a fucking liar.

6082
04:50:28,280 --> 04:50:29,280
Okay.

6083
04:50:29,280 --> 04:50:31,280
Let me finger this in that place.

6084
04:50:32,280 --> 04:50:33,280
Oh, come on.

6085
04:50:36,280 --> 04:50:37,280
Come on.

6086
04:50:37,280 --> 04:50:38,280
Come on, baby.

6087
04:50:39,280 --> 04:50:40,280
Come on, baby.

6088
04:50:42,280 --> 04:50:43,280
He's gonna make me cry.

6089
04:50:47,280 --> 04:50:48,280
Oh, no.

6090
04:50:50,280 --> 04:50:51,280
No, stop breaking.

6091
04:50:51,280 --> 04:50:53,280
I can hear stuff breaking back there.

6092
04:50:53,280 --> 04:50:54,280
Stop it.

6093
04:50:54,280 --> 04:50:55,280
Stop breaking.

6094
04:50:55,280 --> 04:50:56,280
Right, that's it.

6095
04:50:56,280 --> 04:50:58,280
Where's that orange thing?

6096
04:51:02,280 --> 04:51:03,280
Is it the carrots?

6097
04:51:03,280 --> 04:51:04,280
Right, go to the,

6098
04:51:04,280 --> 04:51:05,280
go to the stage

6099
04:51:05,280 --> 04:51:06,280
and think about what you're doing.

6100
04:51:06,280 --> 04:51:07,280
You're stressing me out.

6101
04:51:08,280 --> 04:51:09,280
No.

6102
04:51:09,280 --> 04:51:10,280
No.

6103
04:51:10,280 --> 04:51:11,280
Don't start this up.

6104
04:51:11,280 --> 04:51:12,280
Don't start this up.

6105
04:51:12,280 --> 04:51:14,280
Go and be a good fan.

6106
04:51:15,280 --> 04:51:16,280
Hold on.

6107
04:51:16,280 --> 04:51:17,280
I need a moment to,

6108
04:51:17,280 --> 04:51:19,280
I need a moment to think.

6109
04:51:20,280 --> 04:51:22,280
Do I know what to think of?

6110
04:51:22,280 --> 04:51:24,280
Please, please hold on.

6111
04:51:24,280 --> 04:51:25,280
Yes.

6112
04:51:25,280 --> 04:51:26,280
And like click, no.

6113
04:51:26,280 --> 04:51:27,280
Right.

6114
04:51:27,280 --> 04:51:28,280
What's the problem?

6115
04:51:28,280 --> 04:51:30,280
Why are you counting the balance?

6116
04:51:32,280 --> 04:51:33,280
Go.

6117
04:51:33,280 --> 04:51:34,280
Right.

6118
04:51:34,280 --> 04:51:35,280
No.

6119
04:51:37,280 --> 04:51:39,280
I just bumped my head on the window.

6120
04:51:39,280 --> 04:51:40,280
Hold on.

6121
04:51:40,280 --> 04:51:41,280
Hold on.

6122
04:51:41,280 --> 04:51:42,280
Hold on.

6123
04:51:44,280 --> 04:51:45,280
Lift.

6124
04:51:46,280 --> 04:51:47,280
Okay.

6125
04:51:47,280 --> 04:51:48,280
And right.

6126
04:51:48,280 --> 04:51:49,280
Fuck the quill.

6127
04:51:49,280 --> 04:51:51,280
No one's bothered about it.

6128
04:51:52,280 --> 04:51:54,280
Press down gently on Bilbo's

6129
04:51:56,280 --> 04:51:57,280
writing desk

6130
04:51:57,280 --> 04:51:58,280
to link it

6131
04:51:58,280 --> 04:52:00,280
to the fucking table.

6132
04:52:03,280 --> 04:52:04,280
Just, what?

6133
04:52:04,280 --> 04:52:05,280
Right.

6134
04:52:05,280 --> 04:52:06,280
That's it.

6135
04:52:06,280 --> 04:52:07,280
The table's coming with me.

6136
04:52:08,280 --> 04:52:09,280
I was being nice,

6137
04:52:09,280 --> 04:52:10,280
but you've done it now.

6138
04:52:10,280 --> 04:52:11,280
I was being,

6139
04:52:11,280 --> 04:52:12,280
I was being nice,

6140
04:52:12,280 --> 04:52:13,280
not fucking come up.

6141
04:52:14,280 --> 04:52:15,280
I was being nice.

6142
04:52:17,280 --> 04:52:18,280
Right.

6143
04:52:18,280 --> 04:52:20,280
You, you're fucking down.

6144
04:52:22,280 --> 04:52:23,280
This.

6145
04:52:24,280 --> 04:52:25,280
That's it.

6146
04:52:25,280 --> 04:52:26,280
That's all I wanted.

6147
04:52:26,280 --> 04:52:27,280
Jesus.

6148
04:52:27,280 --> 04:52:28,280
I can't do it.

6149
04:52:29,280 --> 04:52:30,280
That's all I wanted to do.

6150
04:52:31,280 --> 04:52:32,280
There.

6151
04:52:32,280 --> 04:52:33,280
Are you happy?

6152
04:52:33,280 --> 04:52:34,280
Shoot.

6153
04:52:34,280 --> 04:52:35,280
Well,

6154
04:52:35,280 --> 04:52:36,280
evil day.

6155
04:52:36,280 --> 04:52:37,280
Evil, evil.

6156
04:52:38,280 --> 04:52:39,280
Okay.

6157
04:52:39,280 --> 04:52:40,280
And then put his quill down.

6158
04:52:40,280 --> 04:52:41,280
Okay.

6159
04:52:41,280 --> 04:52:42,280
I have to get these nails off of me.

6160
04:52:42,280 --> 04:52:43,280
I'm ripping them out.

6161
04:52:43,280 --> 04:52:44,280
Like,

6162
04:52:44,280 --> 04:52:45,280
what's that?

6163
04:52:45,280 --> 04:52:46,280
Damba anime.

6164
04:52:47,280 --> 04:52:48,280
Cagaguri.

6165
04:52:48,280 --> 04:52:50,280
Ripping my nails out like cagaguri.

6166
04:52:52,280 --> 04:52:53,280
Oh, come on.

6167
04:52:54,280 --> 04:52:55,280
Oh, come on.

6168
04:52:55,280 --> 04:52:56,280
All right.

6169
04:52:59,280 --> 04:53:00,280
And then.

6170
04:53:02,280 --> 04:53:03,280
Oh.

6171
04:53:03,280 --> 04:53:04,280
Oh.

6172
04:53:05,280 --> 04:53:06,280
Oh.

6173
04:53:06,280 --> 04:53:07,280
Right.

6174
04:53:07,280 --> 04:53:08,280
It's done.

6175
04:53:08,280 --> 04:53:09,280
It's done.

6176
04:53:09,280 --> 04:53:10,280
Bilbo's wee corner set up.

6177
04:53:10,280 --> 04:53:11,280
Now what?

6178
04:53:15,280 --> 04:53:17,280
I'm making a dining table.

6179
04:53:18,280 --> 04:53:20,280
The entrance to the house.

6180
04:53:21,280 --> 04:53:23,280
Mummy's getting tired, babies.

6181
04:53:26,280 --> 04:53:27,280
Mummy's ready for a nap,

6182
04:53:27,280 --> 04:53:29,280
but not in a mean way.

6183
04:53:30,280 --> 04:53:31,280
Oh, wait.

6184
04:53:31,280 --> 04:53:32,280
Hold on.

6185
04:53:32,280 --> 04:53:33,280
If I continue,

6186
04:53:33,280 --> 04:53:34,280
it looks like it's just a,

6187
04:53:34,280 --> 04:53:35,280
what, a grass verge.

6188
04:53:37,280 --> 04:53:38,280
I literally don't.

6189
04:53:38,280 --> 04:53:40,280
Oh, it's the roof of the house.

6190
04:53:42,280 --> 04:53:44,280
Oh, there's a tree on it.

6191
04:53:44,280 --> 04:53:46,280
Oh, we're so close.

6192
04:53:46,280 --> 04:53:47,280
Right.

6193
04:53:47,280 --> 04:53:48,280
No.

6194
04:53:48,280 --> 04:53:49,280
Hold it together.

6195
04:53:49,280 --> 04:53:50,280
I can't laugh yet.

6196
04:53:51,280 --> 04:53:52,280
Hold it together.

6197
04:53:52,280 --> 04:53:53,280
Hear me, baby.

6198
04:53:54,280 --> 04:53:55,280
Hold it together.

6199
04:53:56,280 --> 04:53:57,280
Okay.

6200
04:53:58,280 --> 04:53:59,280
Relax.

6201
04:53:59,280 --> 04:54:00,280
Everything's fine.

6202
04:54:00,280 --> 04:54:01,280
Everything's cool

6203
04:54:01,280 --> 04:54:02,280
when you party to tea.

6204
04:54:02,280 --> 04:54:03,280
Right.

6205
04:54:03,280 --> 04:54:04,280
We're going to take out the time bricks

6206
04:54:04,280 --> 04:54:06,280
and we're going to do the front door area.

6207
04:54:07,280 --> 04:54:08,280
And

6208
04:54:10,280 --> 04:54:11,280
maybe I can do it.

6209
04:54:11,280 --> 04:54:12,280
I don't know.

6210
04:54:13,280 --> 04:54:14,280
I don't know.

6211
04:54:15,280 --> 04:54:16,280
I'm tired.

6212
04:54:16,280 --> 04:54:17,280
I'm so fucking exhausted.

6213
04:54:19,280 --> 04:54:20,280
All I do.

6214
04:54:21,280 --> 04:54:22,280
Oh, my God.

6215
04:54:22,280 --> 04:54:23,280
Streamer is tired,

6216
04:54:23,280 --> 04:54:24,280
building Lego.

6217
04:54:24,280 --> 04:54:26,280
Look how entitled these streamers are.

6218
04:54:26,280 --> 04:54:28,280
They're so out of touch with reality.

6219
04:54:29,280 --> 04:54:30,280
I can't believe it.

6220
04:54:30,280 --> 04:54:31,280
These streamers,

6221
04:54:31,280 --> 04:54:33,280
these streamers would know what hard work was

6222
04:54:33,280 --> 04:54:34,280
and if it hit them in their,

6223
04:54:34,280 --> 04:54:35,280
in their face.

6224
04:54:37,280 --> 04:54:38,280
Sorry.

6225
04:54:38,280 --> 04:54:39,280
I'm going to,

6226
04:54:39,280 --> 04:54:40,280
I'm a shadow,

6227
04:54:40,280 --> 04:54:41,280
but mommy,

6228
04:54:41,280 --> 04:54:42,280
they're really, really good.

6229
04:54:42,280 --> 04:54:43,280
I'm called Desperate.

6230
04:54:44,280 --> 04:54:45,280
Just remember this tip.

6231
04:54:45,280 --> 04:54:48,280
If the gumbo recipe tells you to use potatoes,

6232
04:54:48,280 --> 04:54:49,280
it's blind.

6233
04:54:49,280 --> 04:54:50,280
You know what I thought?

6234
04:54:50,280 --> 04:54:52,280
Gumbo was like shrimp potatoes and best.

6235
04:54:52,280 --> 04:54:53,280
Shawnee, take a break.

6236
04:54:53,280 --> 04:54:54,280
We can do another day.

6237
04:54:54,280 --> 04:54:55,280
You're over a spring.

6238
04:54:55,280 --> 04:54:56,280
No, it's not going to.

6239
04:54:56,280 --> 04:54:57,280
Going down without a fight.

6240
04:54:57,280 --> 04:54:59,280
A feature for being out of touch.

6241
04:54:59,280 --> 04:55:00,280
Never.

6242
04:55:00,280 --> 04:55:01,280
Honestly.

6243
04:55:02,280 --> 04:55:04,280
This is all for male attention.

6244
04:55:04,280 --> 04:55:05,280
I actually don't,

6245
04:55:05,280 --> 04:55:06,280
like,

6246
04:55:06,280 --> 04:55:07,280
Lord of the Rings.

6247
04:55:07,280 --> 04:55:09,280
Could you imagine if I didn't know?

6248
04:55:11,280 --> 04:55:13,280
I secretly hate Lord of the Rings.

6249
04:55:13,280 --> 04:55:14,280
I hate everything about it.

6250
04:55:17,280 --> 04:55:18,280
I hate,

6251
04:55:18,280 --> 04:55:20,280
I hate the way that good prevails,

6252
04:55:20,280 --> 04:55:21,280
prevails evil.

6253
04:55:22,280 --> 04:55:24,280
I hate the way that even in the bad,

6254
04:55:24,280 --> 04:55:25,280
there is good,

6255
04:55:25,280 --> 04:55:26,280
i.e. golem.

6256
04:55:26,280 --> 04:55:27,280
I hate the way

6257
04:55:27,280 --> 04:55:30,280
that there's a well thought out fantasy

6258
04:55:30,280 --> 04:55:31,280
and even against,

6259
04:55:31,280 --> 04:55:32,280
oh wait a minute.

6260
04:55:33,280 --> 04:55:35,280
There's in game racism in Lord of the Rings

6261
04:55:35,280 --> 04:55:36,280
isn't there?

6262
04:55:38,280 --> 04:55:39,280
The elves in the dwarves.

6263
04:55:40,280 --> 04:55:41,280
Knife ears.

6264
04:55:42,280 --> 04:55:43,280
What is it,

6265
04:55:43,280 --> 04:55:44,280
what would a dwarf insult the

6266
04:55:44,280 --> 04:55:45,280
beard face?

6267
04:55:46,280 --> 04:55:47,280
Ah, the way you have a beard.

6268
04:55:47,280 --> 04:55:48,280
Oh my god.

6269
04:55:48,280 --> 04:55:49,280
Ah.

6270
04:55:50,280 --> 04:55:51,280
What a beard.

6271
04:55:51,280 --> 04:55:52,280
You're beard.

6272
04:55:52,280 --> 04:55:53,280
Ah, beard.

6273
04:55:53,280 --> 04:55:54,280
Like what?

6274
04:55:54,280 --> 04:55:55,280
How do you insult a dwarf?

6275
04:55:59,280 --> 04:56:00,280
I swear if I turn around

6276
04:56:00,280 --> 04:56:01,280
and read the word manlands.

6277
04:56:02,280 --> 04:56:03,280
Okay, no one did.

6278
04:56:04,280 --> 04:56:05,280
You're actually well behaved.

6279
04:56:06,280 --> 04:56:07,280
A four hour building stream

6280
04:56:07,280 --> 04:56:08,280
for male attention,

6281
04:56:08,280 --> 04:56:10,280
literally suffering through it

6282
04:56:10,280 --> 04:56:11,280
for male attention,

6283
04:56:12,280 --> 04:56:13,280
although I do feel vindicated

6284
04:56:14,280 --> 04:56:15,280
every time someone says

6285
04:56:16,280 --> 04:56:17,280
that they like the stream.

6286
04:56:18,280 --> 04:56:19,280
For anyone who's new and lurking

6287
04:56:19,280 --> 04:56:20,280
by the way,

6288
04:56:20,280 --> 04:56:21,280
this is a massive meme

6289
04:56:21,280 --> 04:56:22,280
in between me and my community.

6290
04:56:23,280 --> 04:56:24,280
I will happily repeat the story

6291
04:56:24,280 --> 04:56:25,280
before you're like,

6292
04:56:25,280 --> 04:56:26,280
what?

6293
04:56:26,280 --> 04:56:27,280
I'm unsubscribing right now.

6294
04:56:28,280 --> 04:56:29,280
So someone asked me,

6295
04:56:29,280 --> 04:56:30,280
in another life,

6296
04:56:30,280 --> 04:56:31,280
they were like,

6297
04:56:31,280 --> 04:56:32,280
why do you play video games?

6298
04:56:32,280 --> 04:56:33,280
And I was like,

6299
04:56:33,280 --> 04:56:34,280
I didn't know what to respond to

6300
04:56:34,280 --> 04:56:35,280
it because I'd never been asked

6301
04:56:35,280 --> 04:56:36,280
that before.

6302
04:56:36,280 --> 04:56:37,280
I was like,

6303
04:56:37,280 --> 04:56:38,280
I just play video games.

6304
04:56:38,280 --> 04:56:39,280
But he was asking

6305
04:56:40,280 --> 04:56:41,280
why I a girl play video games.

6306
04:56:42,280 --> 04:56:43,280
And I was like,

6307
04:56:44,280 --> 04:56:45,280
what are you on about?

6308
04:56:45,280 --> 04:56:46,280
Like,

6309
04:56:46,280 --> 04:56:47,280
like,

6310
04:56:47,280 --> 04:56:48,280
you know,

6311
04:56:48,280 --> 04:56:49,280
instead of being like girls

6312
04:56:49,280 --> 04:56:50,280
play games all the time,

6313
04:56:50,280 --> 04:56:51,280
you just don't know,

6314
04:56:51,280 --> 04:56:52,280
they're all like not talking in

6315
04:56:52,280 --> 04:56:53,280
chat because of harassment

6316
04:56:53,280 --> 04:56:54,280
etc.

6317
04:56:54,280 --> 04:56:55,280
or whatever.

6318
04:56:56,280 --> 04:56:57,280
And I,

6319
04:56:57,280 --> 04:56:58,280
I sarcastically said,

6320
04:56:59,280 --> 04:57:00,280
and I don't know what

6321
04:57:00,280 --> 04:57:01,280
possess me do this,

6322
04:57:01,280 --> 04:57:02,280
but I sarcastically said,

6323
04:57:03,280 --> 04:57:04,280
I do it for male attention.

6324
04:57:05,280 --> 04:57:06,280
And he accepted that answer.

6325
04:57:07,280 --> 04:57:08,280
He didn't question it.

6326
04:57:09,280 --> 04:57:10,280
He didn't like have a ha ha.

6327
04:57:11,280 --> 04:57:12,280
He went, okay.

6328
04:57:12,280 --> 04:57:13,280
And that was it.

6329
04:57:13,280 --> 04:57:14,280
That was the end of the conversation.

6330
04:57:14,280 --> 04:57:15,280
And I'm like,

6331
04:57:17,280 --> 04:57:19,280
so unsubscribed literally,

6332
04:57:20,280 --> 04:57:21,280
literally.

6333
04:57:21,280 --> 04:57:22,280
And I was like,

6334
04:57:22,280 --> 04:57:23,280
so now the running gag is like,

6335
04:57:23,280 --> 04:57:25,280
I only stream for male attention.

6336
04:57:25,280 --> 04:57:26,280
I only do stuff for male attention.

6337
04:57:27,280 --> 04:57:28,280
And,

6338
04:57:29,280 --> 04:57:30,280
and that's what we're

6339
04:57:30,280 --> 04:57:31,280
meaning about when we say

6340
04:57:31,280 --> 04:57:33,280
I only do stuff for male attention.

6341
04:57:34,280 --> 04:57:35,280
Cause

6342
04:57:35,280 --> 04:57:36,280
that was

6343
04:57:37,280 --> 04:57:38,280
an eye-opener.

6344
04:57:38,280 --> 04:57:39,280
It was like, oh,

6345
04:57:39,280 --> 04:57:40,280
that's right.

6346
04:57:40,280 --> 04:57:41,280
People can't help

6347
04:57:41,280 --> 04:57:42,280
sarcasm.

6348
04:57:42,280 --> 04:57:43,280
Wow.

6349
04:57:47,280 --> 04:57:48,280
That bottle

6350
04:57:48,280 --> 04:57:50,280
isn't in this packet again.

6351
04:57:52,280 --> 04:57:53,280
There's no bottle

6352
04:57:53,280 --> 04:57:54,280
in the bowl,

6353
04:57:54,280 --> 04:57:55,280
in my bowl.

6354
04:57:57,280 --> 04:57:58,280
That's interesting.

6355
04:57:58,280 --> 04:57:59,280
That bottle isn't here

6356
04:57:59,280 --> 04:58:01,280
in the other packet as well.

6357
04:58:02,280 --> 04:58:03,280
Curious.

6358
04:58:04,280 --> 04:58:05,280
Seriously.

6359
04:58:05,280 --> 04:58:06,280
Mummy,

6360
04:58:06,280 --> 04:58:07,280
where's my check?

6361
04:58:07,280 --> 04:58:08,280
The paid attorney's payment.

6362
04:58:09,280 --> 04:58:10,280
I don't forget about

6363
04:58:10,280 --> 04:58:11,280
the pre-recorded streams either.

6364
04:58:11,280 --> 04:58:12,280
Wait,

6365
04:58:12,280 --> 04:58:13,280
I've been playing with girls

6366
04:58:13,280 --> 04:58:14,280
online for all these years.

6367
04:58:15,280 --> 04:58:16,280
Oh yeah,

6368
04:58:16,280 --> 04:58:17,280
there is,

6369
04:58:17,280 --> 04:58:18,280
I can assure you

6370
04:58:18,280 --> 04:58:19,280
there is so many more

6371
04:58:20,280 --> 04:58:21,280
growth.

6372
04:58:21,280 --> 04:58:22,280
Oh wait,

6373
04:58:22,280 --> 04:58:23,280
if you're being serious

6374
04:58:23,280 --> 04:58:24,280
for a second,

6375
04:58:24,280 --> 04:58:25,280
I'll be serious back.

6376
04:58:25,280 --> 04:58:26,280
What on that?

6377
04:58:28,280 --> 04:58:29,280
The seats

6378
04:58:29,280 --> 04:58:30,280
are one off of the

6379
04:58:30,280 --> 04:58:31,280
fireplace?

6380
04:58:32,280 --> 04:58:33,280
One

6381
04:58:34,280 --> 04:58:35,280
here?

6382
04:58:35,280 --> 04:58:36,280
And

6383
04:58:36,280 --> 04:58:37,280
if you're being,

6384
04:58:37,280 --> 04:58:38,280
if you want to be serious

6385
04:58:38,280 --> 04:58:39,280
for a second,

6386
04:58:39,280 --> 04:58:40,280
yes,

6387
04:58:40,280 --> 04:58:41,280
there's like

6388
04:58:41,280 --> 04:58:42,280
a kabillion

6389
04:58:42,280 --> 04:58:43,280
gamer grills.

6390
04:58:44,280 --> 04:58:45,280
Can you

6391
04:58:45,280 --> 04:58:46,280
fucking rotate the

6392
04:58:46,280 --> 04:58:47,280
P.O.V.

6393
04:58:47,280 --> 04:58:48,280
you're giving me right now?

6394
04:58:49,280 --> 04:58:50,280
I honestly

6395
04:58:50,280 --> 04:58:51,280
look like it's

6396
04:58:51,280 --> 04:58:52,280
one, two.

6397
04:58:52,280 --> 04:58:53,280
They're two apart.

6398
04:58:55,280 --> 04:58:56,280
Is it possible?

6399
04:58:56,280 --> 04:58:57,280
I don't know.

6400
04:58:57,280 --> 04:58:58,280
It looks like it lines up

6401
04:58:58,280 --> 04:58:59,280
with a fire.

6402
04:58:59,280 --> 04:59:00,280
Well,

6403
04:59:00,280 --> 04:59:01,280
it's a shame

6404
04:59:01,280 --> 04:59:02,280
because it goes over to

6405
04:59:02,280 --> 04:59:03,280
Bilbo's writing desk,

6406
04:59:03,280 --> 04:59:04,280
which is not

6407
04:59:04,280 --> 04:59:05,280
particularly

6408
04:59:05,280 --> 04:59:06,280
what I'm

6409
04:59:06,280 --> 04:59:07,280
interested in.

6410
04:59:07,280 --> 04:59:08,280
What is that?

6411
04:59:08,280 --> 04:59:09,280
Oh,

6412
04:59:09,280 --> 04:59:10,280
the underside of it.

6413
04:59:11,280 --> 04:59:12,280
Yes,

6414
04:59:12,280 --> 04:59:13,280
I cannot tell you

6415
04:59:13,280 --> 04:59:14,280
how many games

6416
04:59:14,280 --> 04:59:15,280
actually have girls in it

6417
04:59:15,280 --> 04:59:16,280
and the only reason

6418
04:59:16,280 --> 04:59:17,280
they don't talk

6419
04:59:17,280 --> 04:59:18,280
is because there's not

6420
04:59:18,280 --> 04:59:19,280
another girl that starts,

6421
04:59:19,280 --> 04:59:20,280
but I,

6422
04:59:20,280 --> 04:59:21,280
well,

6423
04:59:21,280 --> 04:59:22,280
I used to

6424
04:59:22,280 --> 04:59:23,280
when I used to play games.

6425
04:59:23,280 --> 04:59:24,280
I know,

6426
04:59:24,280 --> 04:59:25,280
I used to play for

6427
04:59:25,280 --> 04:59:26,280
male attention

6428
04:59:26,280 --> 04:59:27,280
all those years ago.

6429
04:59:30,280 --> 04:59:31,280
Am I losing it?

6430
04:59:32,280 --> 04:59:33,280
Do you not

6431
04:59:33,280 --> 04:59:34,280
slot in here?

6432
04:59:36,280 --> 04:59:37,280
Am I?

6433
04:59:39,280 --> 04:59:40,280
This is supposed to be

6434
04:59:40,280 --> 04:59:41,280
there?

6435
04:59:41,280 --> 04:59:42,280
Of course.

6436
04:59:43,280 --> 04:59:44,280
And I,

6437
04:59:44,280 --> 04:59:45,280
so you know what I'm

6438
04:59:45,280 --> 04:59:46,280
surprised you guys

6439
04:59:46,280 --> 04:59:47,280
don't have makes talk with

6440
04:59:47,280 --> 04:59:48,280
when we stream

6441
04:59:48,280 --> 04:59:49,280
snipe each other.

6442
04:59:50,280 --> 04:59:51,280
The reason I'm

6443
04:59:51,280 --> 04:59:52,280
surprised is because

6444
04:59:52,280 --> 04:59:53,280
the way I play video games

6445
04:59:53,280 --> 04:59:54,280
is I always say,

6446
04:59:54,280 --> 04:59:55,280
good morning,

6447
04:59:55,280 --> 04:59:56,280
good luck,

6448
04:59:56,280 --> 04:59:57,280
have fun type thing.

6449
04:59:57,280 --> 04:59:58,280
Or like,

6450
04:59:58,280 --> 04:59:59,280
if it's an after,

6451
04:59:59,280 --> 05:00:00,280
if it's afternoon,

6452
05:00:00,280 --> 05:00:01,280
say good afternoon,

6453
05:00:01,280 --> 05:00:02,280
good luck in the game.

6454
05:00:02,280 --> 05:00:03,280
Hope everyone has

6455
05:00:03,280 --> 05:00:04,280
fun type thing.

6456
05:00:04,280 --> 05:00:05,280
I'm that kind of gamer.

6457
05:00:07,280 --> 05:00:08,280
So when you

6458
05:00:08,280 --> 05:00:09,280
are like,

6459
05:00:09,280 --> 05:00:10,280
oh,

6460
05:00:10,280 --> 05:00:11,280
are my purple?

6461
05:00:11,280 --> 05:00:12,280
I'm like,

6462
05:00:12,280 --> 05:00:13,280
oh,

6463
05:00:13,280 --> 05:00:14,280
how do you,

6464
05:00:14,280 --> 05:00:15,280
how do you communicate?

6465
05:00:15,280 --> 05:00:16,280
How do you say

6466
05:00:16,280 --> 05:00:17,280
there's an animal over here?

6467
05:00:17,280 --> 05:00:18,280
Oh,

6468
05:00:18,280 --> 05:00:19,280
sorry,

6469
05:00:19,280 --> 05:00:20,280
I'm talking over Brian.

6470
05:00:21,280 --> 05:00:22,280
Bear questions,

6471
05:00:22,280 --> 05:00:24,280
why wouldn't you play video games?

6472
05:00:24,280 --> 05:00:25,280
I feel like,

6473
05:00:25,280 --> 05:00:26,280
I feel like

6474
05:00:26,280 --> 05:00:27,280
you have to be

6475
05:00:27,280 --> 05:00:28,280
forbade to play the,

6476
05:00:28,280 --> 05:00:29,280
I forbade you.

6477
05:00:29,280 --> 05:00:30,280
What do you mean you're

6478
05:00:30,280 --> 05:00:31,280
forbade me?

6479
05:00:32,280 --> 05:00:33,280
I'm playing video games.

6480
05:00:35,280 --> 05:00:36,280
Stache Power,

6481
05:00:36,280 --> 05:00:37,280
thanks for the tip.

6482
05:00:37,280 --> 05:00:38,280
The better question,

6483
05:00:38,280 --> 05:00:39,280
why wouldn't you play them?

6484
05:00:39,280 --> 05:00:40,280
Because games are like,

6485
05:00:40,280 --> 05:00:41,280
you know,

6486
05:00:41,280 --> 05:00:42,280
they're immersive.

6487
05:00:42,280 --> 05:00:43,280
Yeah.

6488
05:00:43,280 --> 05:00:44,280
I remember

6489
05:00:44,280 --> 05:00:45,280
the classic music

6490
05:00:45,280 --> 05:00:46,280
I like to play video games.

6491
05:00:46,280 --> 05:00:47,280
Mm-hmm.

6492
05:00:48,280 --> 05:00:49,280
I like them,

6493
05:00:49,280 --> 05:00:50,280
I like them when it comes to video games.

6494
05:00:50,280 --> 05:00:51,280
Yeah.

6495
05:00:51,280 --> 05:00:52,280
Again,

6496
05:00:52,280 --> 05:00:53,280
I don't,

6497
05:00:53,280 --> 05:00:54,280
I don't have this bottle.

6498
05:00:54,280 --> 05:00:55,280
It's asking for that bottle diagram.

6499
05:00:55,280 --> 05:00:56,280
This does not exist

6500
05:00:56,280 --> 05:00:57,280
in my itinerary.

6501
05:00:57,280 --> 05:00:58,280
So I guess we're just getting

6502
05:00:58,280 --> 05:00:59,280
out of the table here.

6503
05:01:00,280 --> 05:01:01,280
Um,

6504
05:01:08,280 --> 05:01:09,280
hold on,

6505
05:01:09,280 --> 05:01:10,280
someone,

6506
05:01:10,280 --> 05:01:11,280
the fish is running away.

6507
05:01:12,280 --> 05:01:13,280
Uh,

6508
05:01:13,280 --> 05:01:14,280
my lightbulb.

6509
05:01:14,280 --> 05:01:16,280
I never talk ever except from women.

6510
05:01:16,280 --> 05:01:18,280
Girls in my video games,

6511
05:01:18,280 --> 05:01:20,280
I don't play the new thing.

6512
05:01:20,280 --> 05:01:21,280
I'm a league player,

6513
05:01:21,280 --> 05:01:22,280
so it's pink.

6514
05:01:22,280 --> 05:01:23,280
I have a mic,

6515
05:01:23,280 --> 05:01:24,280
but you haven't played a game.

6516
05:01:24,280 --> 05:01:25,280
I can play,

6517
05:01:25,280 --> 05:01:26,280
I also don't

6518
05:01:26,280 --> 05:01:28,280
want to be a male on stream.

6519
05:01:29,280 --> 05:01:30,280
I don't think we male

6520
05:01:30,280 --> 05:01:31,280
on stream each other.

6521
05:01:31,280 --> 05:01:32,280
Really?

6522
05:01:33,280 --> 05:01:34,280
I don't think we do.

6523
05:01:36,280 --> 05:01:37,280
Yay!

6524
05:01:38,280 --> 05:01:39,280
Come on.

6525
05:01:39,280 --> 05:01:40,280
Come on.

6526
05:01:41,280 --> 05:01:42,280
Hmm.

6527
05:01:46,280 --> 05:01:48,280
I'm sorry for the tracking

6528
05:01:48,280 --> 05:01:50,280
on my model being so weird as well.

6529
05:01:50,280 --> 05:01:51,280
I can't,

6530
05:01:51,280 --> 05:01:52,280
uh...

6531
05:01:54,280 --> 05:01:55,280
Oh!

6532
05:01:56,280 --> 05:01:57,280
Mm-hmm.

6533
05:01:59,280 --> 05:02:00,280
Hmm?

6534
05:02:02,280 --> 05:02:04,280
Where did you just spawn those suits?

6535
05:02:11,280 --> 05:02:12,280
Oh.

6536
05:02:13,280 --> 05:02:14,280
Okay, sorry.

6537
05:02:14,280 --> 05:02:15,280
Um...

6538
05:02:17,280 --> 05:02:18,280
I mean,

6539
05:02:18,280 --> 05:02:19,280
why did it spawn

6540
05:02:19,280 --> 05:02:20,280
on a few seats without

6541
05:02:20,280 --> 05:02:21,280
my instructions?

6542
05:02:21,280 --> 05:02:22,280
That's not...

6543
05:02:22,280 --> 05:02:23,280
Eee,

6544
05:02:23,280 --> 05:02:24,280
Strony on stream,

6545
05:02:24,280 --> 05:02:25,280
what the fuck is this?

6546
05:02:25,280 --> 05:02:26,280
I don't know,

6547
05:02:26,280 --> 05:02:27,280
I find it fun when we get

6548
05:02:27,280 --> 05:02:28,280
to talk to each other.

6549
05:02:28,280 --> 05:02:29,280
Am I weird?

6550
05:02:29,280 --> 05:02:30,280
Is that me,

6551
05:02:30,280 --> 05:02:31,280
parasocial for you?

6552
05:02:32,280 --> 05:02:33,280
I just interest in,

6553
05:02:33,280 --> 05:02:34,280
like, hearing your voices

6554
05:02:34,280 --> 05:02:35,280
or like,

6555
05:02:35,280 --> 05:02:36,280
when you're like,

6556
05:02:36,280 --> 05:02:37,280
oh, thanks for the game, Strony.

6557
05:02:37,280 --> 05:02:38,280
I'm like,

6558
05:02:39,280 --> 05:02:40,280
I don't know,

6559
05:02:40,280 --> 05:02:41,280
maybe I'm just weird

6560
05:02:41,280 --> 05:02:42,280
and obsessive,

6561
05:02:42,280 --> 05:02:43,280
and not with him.

6562
05:02:46,280 --> 05:02:47,280
We've got a streamer

6563
05:02:47,280 --> 05:02:48,280
that actually likes

6564
05:02:48,280 --> 05:02:49,280
our community.

6565
05:02:51,280 --> 05:02:52,280
A streamer that actually

6566
05:02:52,280 --> 05:02:53,280
wants to hang out with us.

6567
05:02:53,280 --> 05:02:54,280
What?

6568
05:02:54,280 --> 05:02:55,280
I've never heard

6569
05:02:55,280 --> 05:02:56,280
of the likes before.

6570
05:02:57,280 --> 05:02:58,280
Well,

6571
05:02:58,280 --> 05:02:59,280
a streamer that knows

6572
05:02:59,280 --> 05:03:00,280
how to gate-cape themselves,

6573
05:03:00,280 --> 05:03:01,280
but I didn't use some more.

6574
05:03:01,280 --> 05:03:03,280
You're Yapaqua!

6575
05:03:04,280 --> 05:03:05,280
As the French say,

6576
05:03:05,280 --> 05:03:06,280
welcome,

6577
05:03:06,280 --> 05:03:07,280
Yapaqua.

6578
05:03:09,280 --> 05:03:10,280
What can I say?

6579
05:03:12,280 --> 05:03:13,280
Sorry,

6580
05:03:13,280 --> 05:03:14,280
I'm often one.

6581
05:03:15,280 --> 05:03:16,280
I play Dota,

6582
05:03:16,280 --> 05:03:17,280
but I'm sorry,

6583
05:03:17,280 --> 05:03:18,280
we can never stream site.

6584
05:03:19,280 --> 05:03:20,280
Also,

6585
05:03:20,280 --> 05:03:21,280
it would be

6586
05:03:21,280 --> 05:03:22,280
disturbing if someone would

6587
05:03:22,280 --> 05:03:23,280
recognize my voice.

6588
05:03:24,280 --> 05:03:25,280
Is it bad that

6589
05:03:25,280 --> 05:03:26,280
sometimes I try

6590
05:03:26,280 --> 05:03:27,280
and link up your voices?

6591
05:03:29,280 --> 05:03:30,280
I don't know,

6592
05:03:30,280 --> 05:03:31,280
it is nice.

6593
05:03:32,280 --> 05:03:33,280
Maybe I was the

6594
05:03:33,280 --> 05:03:34,280
Yandere all along.

6595
05:03:35,280 --> 05:03:36,280
I don't mean it in a

6596
05:03:36,280 --> 05:03:37,280
weird way,

6597
05:03:38,280 --> 05:03:39,280
I don't know.

6598
05:03:42,280 --> 05:03:43,280
If you want to lurk,

6599
05:03:43,280 --> 05:03:44,280
you can lurk-y-poo.

6600
05:03:45,280 --> 05:03:46,280
Hopefully,

6601
05:03:46,280 --> 05:03:47,280
you don't feel any stress

6602
05:03:47,280 --> 05:03:48,280
or pressure from me,

6603
05:03:48,280 --> 05:03:49,280
because like,

6604
05:03:49,280 --> 05:03:50,280
you know,

6605
05:03:50,280 --> 05:03:51,280
do anything

6606
05:03:51,280 --> 05:03:53,280
out of your comfort zone.

6607
05:03:55,280 --> 05:03:56,280
You can always,

6608
05:03:58,280 --> 05:03:59,280
always, always

6609
05:03:59,280 --> 05:04:00,280
just chill with me,

6610
05:04:00,280 --> 05:04:01,280
I'm not gonna,

6611
05:04:02,280 --> 05:04:03,280
I'm not gonna force you

6612
05:04:03,280 --> 05:04:04,280
to do anything.

6613
05:04:05,280 --> 05:04:06,280
Well,

6614
05:04:06,280 --> 05:04:08,280
you need our voice queen.

6615
05:04:09,280 --> 05:04:10,280
That's terrible.

6616
05:04:10,280 --> 05:04:11,280
Please don't say that

6617
05:04:11,280 --> 05:04:12,280
out loud again,

6618
05:04:12,280 --> 05:04:13,280
okay, I'm sorry.

6619
05:04:20,280 --> 05:04:21,280
Here?

6620
05:04:21,280 --> 05:04:22,280
There it is,

6621
05:04:22,280 --> 05:04:23,280
it's here.

6622
05:04:23,280 --> 05:04:24,280
Why is it randomly speaking?

6623
05:04:26,280 --> 05:04:27,280
It's

6624
05:04:28,280 --> 05:04:29,280
telling me to put the seats

6625
05:04:29,280 --> 05:04:30,280
in,

6626
05:04:30,280 --> 05:04:31,280
which I just did.

6627
05:04:31,280 --> 05:04:32,280
I've just done the chair,

6628
05:04:32,280 --> 05:04:33,280
so I need

6629
05:04:34,280 --> 05:04:35,280
a bit of sand

6630
05:04:35,280 --> 05:04:36,280
and the mat.

6631
05:04:37,280 --> 05:04:38,280
Why, of course,

6632
05:04:39,280 --> 05:04:40,280
the mat?

6633
05:04:42,280 --> 05:04:43,280
The one that I'm totally

6634
05:04:43,280 --> 05:04:44,280
not gonna mess up right now.

6635
05:04:45,280 --> 05:04:46,280
I think of that.

6636
05:04:49,280 --> 05:04:50,280
That's funny,

6637
05:04:50,280 --> 05:04:51,280
my great queen,

6638
05:04:51,280 --> 05:04:52,280
no,

6639
05:04:52,280 --> 05:04:53,280
don't start that.

6640
05:04:53,280 --> 05:04:54,280
We could actually

6641
05:04:54,280 --> 05:04:55,280
get in trouble for that one.

6642
05:04:58,280 --> 05:04:59,280
I think that's funny

6643
05:04:59,280 --> 05:05:00,280
when you guys do it,

6644
05:05:00,280 --> 05:05:01,280
when you hear your fantasies

6645
05:05:01,280 --> 05:05:02,280
or whatever,

6646
05:05:03,280 --> 05:05:04,280
like,

6647
05:05:04,280 --> 05:05:05,280
you know how it's like,

6648
05:05:05,280 --> 05:05:06,280
oh, that's naughty,

6649
05:05:06,280 --> 05:05:07,280
that's bad,

6650
05:05:07,280 --> 05:05:08,280
that's how it makes it

6651
05:05:08,280 --> 05:05:10,280
like more enticing?

6652
05:05:12,280 --> 05:05:13,280
Does that make sense?

6653
05:05:14,280 --> 05:05:15,280
Because we know we're not

6654
05:05:15,280 --> 05:05:16,280
supposed to like joke about it,

6655
05:05:16,280 --> 05:05:17,280
and we know we're not supposed

6656
05:05:17,280 --> 05:05:19,280
to like fantasise about it,

6657
05:05:19,280 --> 05:05:21,280
but it like seems to make it

6658
05:05:21,280 --> 05:05:22,280
ten times funnier.

6659
05:05:25,280 --> 05:05:26,280
What's some of your worst

6660
05:05:26,280 --> 05:05:27,280
experiences being

6661
05:05:27,280 --> 05:05:28,280
a chick,

6662
05:05:28,280 --> 05:05:29,280
a demon?

6663
05:05:30,280 --> 05:05:31,280
I had someone

6664
05:05:33,280 --> 05:05:35,280
cause I didn't pocket,

6665
05:05:35,280 --> 05:05:36,280
like cause I didn't do

6666
05:05:36,280 --> 05:05:38,280
their bidding as a tank,

6667
05:05:39,280 --> 05:05:41,280
he basically like

6668
05:05:41,280 --> 05:05:43,280
was screaming down the make

6669
05:05:43,280 --> 05:05:44,280
that I'm an R word

6670
05:05:45,280 --> 05:05:46,280
because I'm a girl

6671
05:05:46,280 --> 05:05:47,280
and like all of that.

6672
05:05:47,280 --> 05:05:49,280
Like I was pretty nasty

6673
05:05:49,280 --> 05:05:50,280
and I was like really surprised

6674
05:05:50,280 --> 05:05:51,280
about it,

6675
05:05:51,280 --> 05:05:52,280
cause I was like,

6676
05:05:52,280 --> 05:05:53,280
no, you're just a really shit DPS.

6677
05:05:53,280 --> 05:05:54,280
If you need a tank,

6678
05:05:55,280 --> 05:05:56,280
I was diva,

6679
05:05:56,280 --> 05:05:57,280
I still remember it,

6680
05:05:57,280 --> 05:05:58,280
I was diva,

6681
05:05:58,280 --> 05:05:59,280
he was soldier

6682
05:05:59,280 --> 05:06:00,280
and he was getting pocketed

6683
05:06:00,280 --> 05:06:01,280
by his healer,

6684
05:06:01,280 --> 05:06:02,280
he was slain.

6685
05:06:04,280 --> 05:06:05,280
And I just got absolutely

6686
05:06:05,280 --> 05:06:06,280
cussed at it.

6687
05:06:06,280 --> 05:06:07,280
I had a guy throw a game

6688
05:06:07,280 --> 05:06:08,280
because I figured out

6689
05:06:08,280 --> 05:06:09,280
I was a girl as well,

6690
05:06:10,280 --> 05:06:11,280
I remember that one,

6691
05:06:11,280 --> 05:06:12,280
I was a Rissa,

6692
05:06:14,280 --> 05:06:15,280
and I just spoke

6693
05:06:15,280 --> 05:06:16,280
and I was like,

6694
05:06:16,280 --> 05:06:17,280
oh, good morning,

6695
05:06:17,280 --> 05:06:18,280
good luck in the games,

6696
05:06:18,280 --> 05:06:19,280
hopefully,

6697
05:06:19,280 --> 05:06:20,280
you know,

6698
05:06:20,280 --> 05:06:21,280
it looks like the enemies

6699
05:06:21,280 --> 05:06:22,280
are XYZ,

6700
05:06:22,280 --> 05:06:23,280
cause I used to go

6701
05:06:23,280 --> 05:06:24,280
into their spawn

6702
05:06:27,280 --> 05:06:28,280
and see who

6703
05:06:28,280 --> 05:06:29,280
was selected and all that

6704
05:06:29,280 --> 05:06:31,280
and the guy was like,

6705
05:06:31,280 --> 05:06:32,280
oh, girl, I'm thrown,

6706
05:06:32,280 --> 05:06:33,280
and he just stopped playing

6707
05:06:33,280 --> 05:06:34,280
and I was like,

6708
05:06:34,280 --> 05:06:35,280
oh, well.

6709
05:06:37,280 --> 05:06:39,280
I do remember the nasty one,

6710
05:06:42,280 --> 05:06:43,280
and don't you learn

6711
05:06:43,280 --> 05:06:44,280
curse words

6712
05:06:44,280 --> 05:06:45,280
in about 10 languages

6713
05:06:45,280 --> 05:06:46,280
if he does that on wrong?

6714
05:06:48,280 --> 05:06:49,280
Is it Reaper mains

6715
05:06:49,280 --> 05:06:50,280
or the worst?

6716
05:06:50,280 --> 05:06:51,280
I mean,

6717
05:06:51,280 --> 05:06:52,280
obviously I don't play anymore,

6718
05:06:52,280 --> 05:06:53,280
so you forget

6719
05:06:53,280 --> 05:06:54,280
the bad interactions

6720
05:06:54,280 --> 05:06:55,280
over time,

6721
05:06:55,280 --> 05:06:56,280
but you know when you have

6722
05:06:56,280 --> 05:06:57,280
like a really bad one

6723
05:06:57,280 --> 05:06:58,280
and it was like,

6724
05:06:58,280 --> 05:06:59,280
you know when you walk away

6725
05:06:59,280 --> 05:07:00,280
and you're like,

6726
05:07:00,280 --> 05:07:01,280
wow, that person had

6727
05:07:01,280 --> 05:07:02,280
like a genuine hatred

6728
05:07:02,280 --> 05:07:03,280
towards me

6729
05:07:03,280 --> 05:07:04,280
and I literally

6730
05:07:04,280 --> 05:07:06,280
was just playing a video game,

6731
05:07:06,280 --> 05:07:07,280
like I was just mucking

6732
05:07:07,280 --> 05:07:08,280
about having fun,

6733
05:07:08,280 --> 05:07:09,280
I mean, you've heard me

6734
05:07:09,280 --> 05:07:10,280
on Overwatch,

6735
05:07:10,280 --> 05:07:11,280
I'm screaming,

6736
05:07:11,280 --> 05:07:12,280
I'm hootering,

6737
05:07:12,280 --> 05:07:13,280
I'm hollering,

6738
05:07:14,280 --> 05:07:15,280
like I'm just having

6739
05:07:15,280 --> 05:07:16,280
like a goofy time

6740
05:07:16,280 --> 05:07:17,280
or whatever,

6741
05:07:18,280 --> 05:07:19,280
you can imagine

6742
05:07:19,280 --> 05:07:20,280
like if someone turns

6743
05:07:20,280 --> 05:07:21,280
around and is like,

6744
05:07:22,280 --> 05:07:23,280
you should,

6745
05:07:23,280 --> 05:07:24,280
you know,

6746
05:07:24,280 --> 05:07:25,280
do-do-do-do-do,

6747
05:07:25,280 --> 05:07:26,280
do-do-do-do,

6748
05:07:26,280 --> 05:07:27,280
like all of this stuff

6749
05:07:27,280 --> 05:07:28,280
because like I was born into,

6750
05:07:28,280 --> 05:07:29,280
you can imagine my surprise

6751
05:07:29,280 --> 05:07:30,280
where I'm like,

6752
05:07:30,280 --> 05:07:31,280
oh, okay,

6753
05:07:32,280 --> 05:07:34,280
like it's a complete mood changer

6754
05:07:34,280 --> 05:07:35,280
and you do remember

6755
05:07:35,280 --> 05:07:36,280
the bad ones, like,

6756
05:07:38,280 --> 05:07:39,280
I mean,

6757
05:07:39,280 --> 05:07:40,280
you guys have already kind of

6758
05:07:40,280 --> 05:07:41,280
heard the stories like,

6759
05:07:41,280 --> 05:07:42,280
oh,

6760
05:07:42,280 --> 05:07:43,280
chick gamers,

6761
05:07:44,280 --> 05:07:45,280
you get a bit of harassment

6762
05:07:45,280 --> 05:07:46,280
and I mean,

6763
05:07:46,280 --> 05:07:47,280
I'm not going to fucking

6764
05:07:47,280 --> 05:07:48,280
dwell on it,

6765
05:07:48,280 --> 05:07:49,280
I'm just like,

6766
05:07:49,280 --> 05:07:50,280
yeah, I get harassment,

6767
05:07:50,280 --> 05:07:51,280
but I'm still alive.

6768
05:07:52,280 --> 05:07:53,280
Yeah, it sucks,

6769
05:07:53,280 --> 05:07:54,280
but does that,

6770
05:07:54,280 --> 05:07:55,280
is that going to stop me

6771
05:07:55,280 --> 05:07:56,280
from like playing,

6772
05:07:56,280 --> 05:07:57,280
I suppose that's the question

6773
05:07:57,280 --> 05:07:58,280
you have to ask yourself,

6774
05:08:00,280 --> 05:08:01,280
is it

6775
05:08:01,280 --> 05:08:02,280
so bad

6776
05:08:02,280 --> 05:08:03,280
that you genuinely

6777
05:08:03,280 --> 05:08:04,280
don't want to play

6778
05:08:04,280 --> 05:08:05,280
video games after

6779
05:08:05,280 --> 05:08:06,280
and like,

6780
05:08:06,280 --> 05:08:07,280
the answer is not,

6781
05:08:07,280 --> 05:08:08,280
like,

6782
05:08:08,280 --> 05:08:09,280
you'll survive,

6783
05:08:09,280 --> 05:08:10,280
it's not pleasant,

6784
05:08:10,280 --> 05:08:11,280
don't get me wrong,

6785
05:08:11,280 --> 05:08:12,280
I'm not fucking saying,

6786
05:08:12,280 --> 05:08:13,280
I'm not saying suck it up,

6787
05:08:13,280 --> 05:08:15,280
but I'm saying like,

6788
05:08:15,280 --> 05:08:16,280
if you're only going to remember

6789
05:08:16,280 --> 05:08:17,280
the bad,

6790
05:08:17,280 --> 05:08:18,280
then yeah,

6791
05:08:18,280 --> 05:08:19,280
no shit,

6792
05:08:19,280 --> 05:08:20,280
gaming is going to be

6793
05:08:20,280 --> 05:08:21,280
like a horrible,

6794
05:08:21,280 --> 05:08:22,280
stressful experience

6795
05:08:22,280 --> 05:08:23,280
for you

6796
05:08:23,280 --> 05:08:24,280
if you're going to focus in

6797
05:08:24,280 --> 05:08:25,280
on the bad,

6798
05:08:25,280 --> 05:08:26,280
but,

6799
05:08:26,280 --> 05:08:27,280
I mean,

6800
05:08:27,280 --> 05:08:28,280
if you heard me in

6801
05:08:28,280 --> 05:08:29,280
vermin tide

6802
05:08:29,280 --> 05:08:30,280
and overwatch,

6803
05:08:30,280 --> 05:08:31,280
like,

6804
05:08:31,280 --> 05:08:32,280
where I'm goofing off,

6805
05:08:32,280 --> 05:08:33,280
everyone's being so nice,

6806
05:08:33,280 --> 05:08:34,280
I've not had anyone,

6807
05:08:34,280 --> 05:08:35,280
you know,

6808
05:08:35,280 --> 05:08:36,280
stream snake me

6809
05:08:36,280 --> 05:08:37,280
and say anything nasty,

6810
05:08:37,280 --> 05:08:38,280
like,

6811
05:08:38,280 --> 05:08:39,280
it's just a hoot

6812
05:08:39,280 --> 05:08:40,280
and a holler,

6813
05:08:41,280 --> 05:08:42,280
and,

6814
05:08:42,280 --> 05:08:44,280
it's all the good stuff,

6815
05:08:44,280 --> 05:08:45,280
like,

6816
05:08:45,280 --> 05:08:47,280
it's nice being able to

6817
05:08:48,280 --> 05:08:49,280
just play,

6818
05:08:50,280 --> 05:08:51,280
and be gamers,

6819
05:08:51,280 --> 05:08:52,280
like,

6820
05:08:52,280 --> 05:08:53,280
I know I'm not like

6821
05:08:53,280 --> 05:08:54,280
the strongest gamer,

6822
05:08:54,280 --> 05:08:56,280
I enjoy video games,

6823
05:08:56,280 --> 05:08:57,280
and,

6824
05:08:57,280 --> 05:08:58,280
I enjoy the,

6825
05:08:58,280 --> 05:08:59,280
the,

6826
05:08:59,280 --> 05:09:00,280
is it medium?

6827
05:09:00,280 --> 05:09:01,280
Medium?

6828
05:09:02,280 --> 05:09:03,280
Put that baguette on the table,

6829
05:09:03,280 --> 05:09:04,280
you know,

6830
05:09:04,280 --> 05:09:05,280
French up in here.

6831
05:09:05,280 --> 05:09:06,280
Okay.

6832
05:09:07,280 --> 05:09:08,280
I guess I can put the

6833
05:09:08,280 --> 05:09:09,280
wine glasses down.

6834
05:09:09,280 --> 05:09:10,280
Oh,

6835
05:09:10,280 --> 05:09:11,280
the one wine glass

6836
05:09:11,280 --> 05:09:12,280
that's given me.

6837
05:09:12,280 --> 05:09:13,280
Okay,

6838
05:09:13,280 --> 05:09:14,280
I'll put that.

6839
05:09:14,280 --> 05:09:15,280
Oh wait,

6840
05:09:15,280 --> 05:09:16,280
no,

6841
05:09:16,280 --> 05:09:17,280
the wine glass

6842
05:09:17,280 --> 05:09:18,280
is already on the table.

6843
05:09:19,280 --> 05:09:20,280
Oh,

6844
05:09:20,280 --> 05:09:21,280
is that the ball?

6845
05:09:21,280 --> 05:09:23,280
It's an upside down glass?

6846
05:09:23,280 --> 05:09:24,280
Oh,

6847
05:09:25,280 --> 05:09:26,280
it appears my

6848
05:09:26,280 --> 05:09:28,280
particular strength in me.

6849
05:09:29,280 --> 05:09:30,280
A pretzel?

6850
05:09:30,280 --> 05:09:31,280
Oh my gosh,

6851
05:09:31,280 --> 05:09:32,280
look,

6852
05:09:32,280 --> 05:09:33,280
I've got three holes for you,

6853
05:09:33,280 --> 05:09:34,280
just like a pretzel.

6854
05:09:34,280 --> 05:09:35,280
You're welcome.

6855
05:09:36,280 --> 05:09:37,280
You can use that anytime.

6856
05:09:39,280 --> 05:09:40,280
Okay,

6857
05:09:40,280 --> 05:09:41,280
it's medium.

6858
05:09:42,280 --> 05:09:43,280
To be honest,

6859
05:09:43,280 --> 05:09:44,280
you're a little too hyper

6860
05:09:44,280 --> 05:09:45,280
and over much.

6861
05:09:45,280 --> 05:09:46,280
Nah,

6862
05:09:46,280 --> 05:09:48,280
I enjoy playing video games.

6863
05:09:49,280 --> 05:09:50,280
Uh,

6864
05:09:51,280 --> 05:09:53,280
see how many left over?

6865
05:09:53,280 --> 05:09:55,280
A random boom handle?

6866
05:09:55,280 --> 05:09:56,280
What am I supposed to do?

6867
05:09:56,280 --> 05:09:57,280
Like,

6868
05:09:57,280 --> 05:09:59,280
what am I supposed to do with it?

6869
05:09:59,280 --> 05:10:00,280
I don't know.

6870
05:10:04,280 --> 05:10:05,280
Uh,

6871
05:10:06,280 --> 05:10:08,280
the next part is just the roof.

6872
05:10:08,280 --> 05:10:11,280
Are we bothered about the roof right now?

6873
05:10:12,280 --> 05:10:13,280
I tell you what,

6874
05:10:13,280 --> 05:10:14,280
can I make

6875
05:10:14,280 --> 05:10:16,280
the rest of the party?

6876
05:10:17,280 --> 05:10:18,280
And then

6877
05:10:19,280 --> 05:10:20,280
I actually like that

6878
05:10:20,280 --> 05:10:21,280
the back of the

6879
05:10:21,280 --> 05:10:22,280
thing is open.

6880
05:10:22,280 --> 05:10:24,280
I like how the roof is open.

6881
05:10:26,280 --> 05:10:27,280
And then we can role play inside.

6882
05:10:27,280 --> 05:10:28,280
Right,

6883
05:10:28,280 --> 05:10:29,280
I'll make the rest of the party

6884
05:10:29,280 --> 05:10:30,280
and we can deal.

6885
05:10:31,280 --> 05:10:32,280
And then I'm going to do

6886
05:10:32,280 --> 05:10:33,280
what I need to do.

6887
05:10:34,280 --> 05:10:35,280
Oh,

6888
05:10:35,280 --> 05:10:36,280
my ankle,

6889
05:10:36,280 --> 05:10:37,280
I don't know if you heard that.

6890
05:10:39,280 --> 05:10:40,280
Right,

6891
05:10:40,280 --> 05:10:41,280
so where was this other ball

6892
05:10:41,280 --> 05:10:42,280
supposed to go?

6893
05:10:42,280 --> 05:10:43,280
Was it supposed to go here?

6894
05:10:43,280 --> 05:10:44,280
In the corner.

6895
05:10:44,280 --> 05:10:45,280
The roof looks like something

6896
05:10:45,280 --> 05:10:46,280
you could do off stream.

6897
05:10:46,280 --> 05:10:47,280
Is that allowed?

6898
05:10:49,280 --> 05:10:50,280
I'm going to go for a nap

6899
05:10:50,280 --> 05:10:51,280
and I'll rest up.

6900
05:10:52,280 --> 05:10:53,280
I'm up.

6901
05:10:54,280 --> 05:10:55,280
You know,

6902
05:10:55,280 --> 05:10:56,280
fuck it,

6903
05:10:56,280 --> 05:10:57,280
we'll put two bottles

6904
05:10:57,280 --> 05:10:58,280
on the table then.

6905
05:10:58,280 --> 05:10:59,280
You heard that crack?

6906
05:10:59,280 --> 05:11:00,280
Yeah,

6907
05:11:00,280 --> 05:11:01,280
that was my ankle.

6908
05:11:01,280 --> 05:11:02,280
We are lining

6909
05:11:02,280 --> 05:11:03,280
because I'm sitting on it.

6910
05:11:04,280 --> 05:11:05,280
Okay,

6911
05:11:05,280 --> 05:11:06,280
same as before,

6912
05:11:06,280 --> 05:11:07,280
big leafling.

6913
05:11:08,280 --> 05:11:09,280
Pieces go in this one

6914
05:11:10,280 --> 05:11:11,280
and I'll do it off stream

6915
05:11:11,280 --> 05:11:12,280
and then

6916
05:11:13,280 --> 05:11:14,280
and I'll do it off stream

6917
05:11:14,280 --> 05:11:15,280
and finish it

6918
05:11:15,280 --> 05:11:16,280
like a good grill.

6919
05:11:17,280 --> 05:11:18,280
As you are,

6920
05:11:18,280 --> 05:11:19,280
my witness.

6921
05:11:24,280 --> 05:11:25,280
Oh, my gosh.

6922
05:11:25,280 --> 05:11:26,280
Okay.

6923
05:11:29,280 --> 05:11:30,280
Okay.

6924
05:11:31,280 --> 05:11:32,280
Me like,

6925
05:11:32,280 --> 05:11:33,280
oh,

6926
05:11:33,280 --> 05:11:34,280
I'll just,

6927
05:11:34,280 --> 05:11:35,280
oh no,

6928
05:11:35,280 --> 05:11:36,280
the grass.

6929
05:11:37,280 --> 05:11:38,280
Can you please,

6930
05:11:38,280 --> 05:11:39,280
please join us,

6931
05:11:39,280 --> 05:11:40,280
please join us,

6932
05:11:40,280 --> 05:11:41,280
please join us.

6933
05:11:42,280 --> 05:11:43,280
No,

6934
05:11:43,280 --> 05:11:44,280
no,

6935
05:11:44,280 --> 05:11:45,280
no,

6936
05:11:45,280 --> 05:11:46,280
I assure you

6937
05:11:46,280 --> 05:11:47,280
we want your part of the house.

6938
05:11:48,280 --> 05:11:49,280
Oh,

6939
05:11:49,280 --> 05:11:50,280
no,

6940
05:11:50,280 --> 05:11:51,280
don't do that.

6941
05:11:51,280 --> 05:11:52,280
Oh,

6942
05:11:52,280 --> 05:11:53,280
it's scared.

6943
05:11:53,280 --> 05:11:54,280
No,

6944
05:11:54,280 --> 05:11:55,280
no,

6945
05:11:55,280 --> 05:11:56,280
no,

6946
05:11:56,280 --> 05:11:57,280
no,

6947
05:11:57,280 --> 05:11:58,280
no,

6948
05:11:58,280 --> 05:11:59,280
no,

6949
05:11:59,280 --> 05:12:00,280
no,

6950
05:12:00,280 --> 05:12:01,280
no,

6951
05:12:01,280 --> 05:12:02,280
no,

6952
05:12:02,280 --> 05:12:03,280
no,

6953
05:12:03,280 --> 05:12:04,280
no,

6954
05:12:04,280 --> 05:12:05,280
no,

6955
05:12:05,280 --> 05:12:06,280
no,

6956
05:12:06,280 --> 05:12:07,280
no,

6957
05:12:07,280 --> 05:12:08,280
no,

6958
05:12:09,280 --> 05:12:10,280
no,

6959
05:12:10,280 --> 05:12:12,280
please join back.

6960
05:12:16,280 --> 05:12:17,280
Okay,

6961
05:12:17,280 --> 05:12:18,280
yeah,

6962
05:12:18,280 --> 05:12:19,280
yeah,

6963
05:12:19,280 --> 05:12:20,280
and then over a bit.

6964
05:12:21,280 --> 05:12:22,280
Yeah,

6965
05:12:23,280 --> 05:12:26,280
it's not something

6966
05:12:27,280 --> 05:12:28,280
hmm.

6967
05:12:28,280 --> 05:12:30,280
What have I done?

6968
05:12:31,280 --> 05:12:32,280
Like that.

6969
05:12:32,280 --> 05:12:33,280
Okay.

6970
05:12:33,280 --> 05:12:34,280
Yeah,

6971
05:12:34,280 --> 05:12:35,280
that looks right.

6972
05:12:35,280 --> 05:12:37,280
Then what is it?

6973
05:12:45,280 --> 05:12:48,280
I'm afraid mommy's a bit patina right now.

6974
05:12:49,280 --> 05:12:52,280
Okay, that'll look much more like it.

6975
05:12:52,280 --> 05:12:54,280
Okay, that'll look more like it.

6976
05:12:54,280 --> 05:13:06,280
Okay, thank you for the mention.

6977
05:13:06,280 --> 05:13:12,280
Yeah, I'd say something controversial before.

6978
05:13:12,280 --> 05:13:15,280
The house is a bit janky for the price.

6979
05:13:15,280 --> 05:13:20,280
I don't know what the actual retail price was when it came out.

6980
05:13:20,280 --> 05:13:23,280
That's a whole other kettle of fish.

6981
05:13:33,280 --> 05:13:36,280
Can I get the rest of the part in yet?

6982
05:13:36,280 --> 05:13:38,280
Wait, how is there chicken here?

6983
05:13:38,280 --> 05:13:40,280
Did I not put chicken on the table?

6984
05:13:40,280 --> 05:13:42,280
Oh, you're flying out.

6985
05:13:42,280 --> 05:13:47,280
I feel like these Lego sets are like once you've built them, you can never look at them.

6986
05:13:47,280 --> 05:13:49,280
Or they're just going to like...

6987
05:13:59,280 --> 05:14:01,280
So we need Dualen.

6988
05:14:01,280 --> 05:14:03,280
There you go.

6989
05:14:03,280 --> 05:14:05,280
And Bomber.

6990
05:14:05,280 --> 05:14:07,280
Dualen and Bomber.

6991
05:14:07,280 --> 05:14:14,280
It's very interesting that they didn't put everyone in it.

6992
05:14:14,280 --> 05:14:17,280
I didn't eat that part, so...

6993
05:14:26,280 --> 05:14:29,280
Wait, is that Gandalf's stick?

6994
05:14:29,280 --> 05:14:32,280
Did Gandalf have a stick?

6995
05:14:32,280 --> 05:14:35,280
Oh, hold on.

6996
05:14:35,280 --> 05:14:37,280
Be careful.

6997
05:14:37,280 --> 05:14:41,280
I believe this is the walking stick.

6998
05:14:41,280 --> 05:14:43,280
That one's yours.

6999
05:14:43,280 --> 05:14:45,280
Okay, thank you.

7000
05:14:45,280 --> 05:14:47,280
And then...

7001
05:14:49,280 --> 05:14:52,280
Can I have some legs, please?

7002
05:14:52,280 --> 05:14:55,280
Oh, a friend pair.

7003
05:14:55,280 --> 05:14:58,280
Is that Dualen's?

7004
05:14:58,280 --> 05:15:01,280
It looks like a...

7005
05:15:01,280 --> 05:15:04,280
It looks like a Dualen's.

7006
05:15:04,280 --> 05:15:07,280
Depends on the set. Some are good to look at.

7007
05:15:07,280 --> 05:15:10,280
That was a good idea.

7008
05:15:11,280 --> 05:15:13,280
Gandalf literally loves his lovely stuff.

7009
05:15:13,280 --> 05:15:16,280
He's a fake fan sometimes, honestly.

7010
05:15:16,280 --> 05:15:20,280
Proof that I do it for male attention.

7011
05:15:23,280 --> 05:15:26,280
Okay, I must be in this packet.

7012
05:15:26,280 --> 05:15:30,280
Why would his legs be in this?

7013
05:15:30,280 --> 05:15:34,280
Ah, it is. A part of his body's in here.

7014
05:15:34,280 --> 05:15:38,280
Okay, let's get him out.

7015
05:15:38,280 --> 05:15:41,280
Is that a sausage?

7016
05:15:41,280 --> 05:15:44,280
Is this for Bomber?

7017
05:15:44,280 --> 05:15:47,280
No, the item he holds is a fucking sausage.

7018
05:15:50,280 --> 05:15:53,280
Okay, and then...

7019
05:15:53,280 --> 05:15:56,280
Nine?

7020
05:15:56,280 --> 05:15:59,280
Who's nine?

7021
05:15:59,280 --> 05:16:03,280
One is... Oh, one for Bomber and one for Dualen.

7022
05:16:03,280 --> 05:16:06,280
Hmm, okay.

7023
05:16:07,280 --> 05:16:14,280
I've seen those YouTube videos where people have a massive, massive, massive...

7024
05:16:14,280 --> 05:16:18,280
Nethin' is all he says.

7025
05:16:18,280 --> 05:16:22,280
Where's the prompt to press the button and hold so often?

7026
05:16:22,280 --> 05:16:26,280
Honestly?

7027
05:16:26,280 --> 05:16:28,280
Honestly, no.

7028
05:16:28,280 --> 05:16:30,280
Right, let's...

7029
05:16:30,280 --> 05:16:34,280
He only has one face, which looks disgruntled.

7030
05:16:34,280 --> 05:16:36,280
Okay.

7031
05:16:36,280 --> 05:16:38,280
Roots.

7032
05:16:38,280 --> 05:16:40,280
Right, let's... Where the fuck...

7033
05:16:40,280 --> 05:16:42,280
Alright, there's his chest.

7034
05:16:42,280 --> 05:16:44,280
Okay, that is both.

7035
05:16:44,280 --> 05:16:47,280
Hair and beard, which is...

7036
05:16:47,280 --> 05:16:50,280
separate in casing because it's so special.

7037
05:16:50,280 --> 05:16:52,280
I can't even do it.

7038
05:16:52,280 --> 05:16:55,280
Are you kidding me? I have, like, fucking weapons on my...

7039
05:16:55,280 --> 05:16:58,280
end of my fingernail, and I...

7040
05:17:00,280 --> 05:17:03,280
There we go. There we go.

7041
05:17:03,280 --> 05:17:05,280
I did, I did.

7042
05:17:05,280 --> 05:17:06,280
Hmm?

7043
05:17:06,280 --> 05:17:08,280
I never watched Lord of the Rings, but I know Gandalf has a big stick

7044
05:17:08,280 --> 05:17:09,280
because he's the one that says,

7045
05:17:09,280 --> 05:17:10,280
You shall not...

7046
05:17:10,280 --> 05:17:11,280
You've not seen it?

7047
05:17:11,280 --> 05:17:12,280
Well, my fucking presents to you.

7048
05:17:12,280 --> 05:17:16,280
I know what you're doing, I'm just...

7049
05:17:16,280 --> 05:17:19,280
I'm being forced to...

7050
05:17:19,280 --> 05:17:21,280
watch...

7051
05:17:21,280 --> 05:17:24,280
Lord of the Rings.

7052
05:17:24,280 --> 05:17:26,280
We do trading places.

7053
05:17:26,280 --> 05:17:28,280
I think I was going to do a lot of streams,

7054
05:17:28,280 --> 05:17:30,280
but I'm interested in our purchases,

7055
05:17:30,280 --> 05:17:32,280
so we can...

7056
05:17:32,280 --> 05:17:34,280
Oh, come on.

7057
05:17:34,280 --> 05:17:36,280
Um...

7058
05:17:36,280 --> 05:17:40,280
Yes, I'm streaming on Krimis and Balcony,

7059
05:17:40,280 --> 05:17:42,280
and the other day I set up

7060
05:17:42,280 --> 05:17:44,280
some free presents.

7061
05:17:44,280 --> 05:17:46,280
Yeah, okay.

7062
05:17:46,280 --> 05:17:48,280
This is...

7063
05:17:48,280 --> 05:17:50,280
looking a bit...

7064
05:17:50,280 --> 05:17:52,280
Why does it look...

7065
05:17:52,280 --> 05:17:54,280
not quite right?

7066
05:17:54,280 --> 05:17:56,280
Something's not quite right,

7067
05:17:57,280 --> 05:17:58,280
Oh!

7068
05:17:58,280 --> 05:18:00,280
He's bald!

7069
05:18:00,280 --> 05:18:04,280
Please take the sausage.

7070
05:18:04,280 --> 05:18:05,280
One...

7071
05:18:05,280 --> 05:18:06,280
One!

7072
05:18:06,280 --> 05:18:09,280
Please take the sausage!

7073
05:18:09,280 --> 05:18:12,280
Okay.

7074
05:18:12,280 --> 05:18:18,280
Okay, now put your...

7075
05:18:18,280 --> 05:18:22,280
It looks like he's slightly looking the wrong way.

7076
05:18:22,280 --> 05:18:25,280
That looks so wrong.

7077
05:18:25,280 --> 05:18:27,280
Okay, that'll do.

7078
05:18:27,280 --> 05:18:29,280
Cheese!

7079
05:18:29,280 --> 05:18:31,280
Okay, now we do this thing.

7080
05:18:31,280 --> 05:18:33,280
See, why don't they not have that for all the capes?

7081
05:18:33,280 --> 05:18:35,280
That's just super easy to do.

7082
05:18:35,280 --> 05:18:36,280
I mean...

7083
05:18:36,280 --> 05:18:39,280
So cool, isn't it?

7084
05:18:39,280 --> 05:18:40,280
Mm-hmm.

7085
05:18:40,280 --> 05:18:41,280
Oh!

7086
05:18:41,280 --> 05:18:44,280
Oh, he's halfway across the mountain.

7087
05:18:44,280 --> 05:18:46,280
Oh wait, he has beard?

7088
05:18:46,280 --> 05:18:49,280
Of course he has a beard.

7089
05:18:49,280 --> 05:18:52,280
And why would he put the beard on him?

7090
05:18:52,280 --> 05:18:55,280
Because that would have been too easy.

7091
05:18:55,280 --> 05:18:57,280
Wait, what's the back of his beard?

7092
05:18:57,280 --> 05:18:59,280
Hold on, I'm a fake fan, clearly.

7093
05:18:59,280 --> 05:19:01,280
Sorry to all of them.

7094
05:19:01,280 --> 05:19:03,280
Oh, no, mine mustn't be there.

7095
05:19:03,280 --> 05:19:05,280
Ah!

7096
05:19:05,280 --> 05:19:08,280
Come on, unexpected gathering,

7097
05:19:08,280 --> 05:19:10,280
unexpected tune.

7098
05:19:10,280 --> 05:19:11,280
That looks right.

7099
05:19:11,280 --> 05:19:13,280
Where's your weapon, then?

7100
05:19:13,280 --> 05:19:14,280
Time to assemble it.

7101
05:19:14,280 --> 05:19:16,280
Your fucking weapon?

7102
05:19:16,280 --> 05:19:20,280
Where's it, like, a pre-made piece?

7103
05:19:20,280 --> 05:19:22,280
I don't...

7104
05:19:22,280 --> 05:19:25,280
see his weapon.

7105
05:19:25,280 --> 05:19:28,280
I think I have to mute it.

7106
05:19:28,280 --> 05:19:30,280
Ugh, that's just too much effort, isn't it?

7107
05:19:30,280 --> 05:19:32,280
Mm-hmm.

7108
05:19:32,280 --> 05:19:34,280
Ah, I'm not late in the day for that,

7109
05:19:34,280 --> 05:19:36,280
don't you think, Dwellin?

7110
05:19:36,280 --> 05:19:40,280
I'm struck from your weaponry.

7111
05:19:40,280 --> 05:19:41,280
Okay.

7112
05:19:41,280 --> 05:19:44,280
Oh, careful.

7113
05:19:44,280 --> 05:19:46,280
Oh!

7114
05:19:46,280 --> 05:19:48,280
Excuse me, sorry.

7115
05:19:48,280 --> 05:19:50,280
You're pulling.

7116
05:19:50,280 --> 05:19:52,280
Mm-hmm.

7117
05:19:52,280 --> 05:19:56,280
And then the nape, right?

7118
05:19:56,280 --> 05:19:58,280
I don't know why they didn't separate me,

7119
05:19:58,280 --> 05:20:00,280
they're mounting me.

7120
05:20:00,280 --> 05:20:02,280
Ugh.

7121
05:20:02,280 --> 05:20:04,280
Yeah.

7122
05:20:04,280 --> 05:20:05,280
Yeah.

7123
05:20:05,280 --> 05:20:06,280
Okay.

7124
05:20:06,280 --> 05:20:09,280
He's gonna have a freaking nape on this one.

7125
05:20:09,280 --> 05:20:13,280
And then, who has the other nape?

7126
05:20:13,280 --> 05:20:16,280
Oh, it just depends who you want to roleplay with.

7127
05:20:16,280 --> 05:20:19,280
Okay, we'll fit the knife in the...

7128
05:20:19,280 --> 05:20:22,280
in the, um, this.

7129
05:20:22,280 --> 05:20:24,280
Okay, a knife in there.

7130
05:20:24,280 --> 05:20:27,280
So he's gonna be eating his sausage at the table

7131
05:20:27,280 --> 05:20:28,280
because he really has to.

7132
05:20:28,280 --> 05:20:29,280
Can I get him to sit down here?

7133
05:20:29,280 --> 05:20:32,280
Wait, what, Lego butts?

7134
05:20:32,280 --> 05:20:35,280
Don't Legos not have butts to sit down in?

7135
05:20:35,280 --> 05:20:38,280
Okay, I guess he's at the table eating.

7136
05:20:38,280 --> 05:20:45,280
Then Bilbo is gonna be at the door, like, with it open?

7137
05:20:45,280 --> 05:20:46,280
Right.

7138
05:20:46,280 --> 05:20:47,280
No.

7139
05:20:47,280 --> 05:20:48,280
Actually, can he hold it?

7140
05:20:48,280 --> 05:20:50,280
Oh, I just, oh, sorry.

7141
05:20:50,280 --> 05:20:52,280
Put that back on right now.

7142
05:20:52,280 --> 05:20:54,280
Eh, right, knives are off because everyone's,

7143
05:20:54,280 --> 05:20:56,280
everyone's just chilling.

7144
05:20:56,280 --> 05:20:57,280
Knives are down.

7145
05:20:57,280 --> 05:21:02,280
So I put a glass in the...

7146
05:21:02,280 --> 05:21:04,280
I'm at the wall in which I'm in.

7147
05:21:04,280 --> 05:21:05,280
Balan?

7148
05:21:05,280 --> 05:21:06,280
Balan's hand.

7149
05:21:06,280 --> 05:21:08,280
Because he's only having a glass.

7150
05:21:08,280 --> 05:21:10,280
He's like, oh my God, it's so nice to see.

7151
05:21:10,280 --> 05:21:13,280
Oh, right, he's off.

7152
05:21:13,280 --> 05:21:17,280
And then, ah, he's gonna be at the door when he went

7153
05:21:17,280 --> 05:21:20,280
and he's already taken it off.

7154
05:21:20,280 --> 05:21:23,280
And then he's gonna...

7155
05:21:23,280 --> 05:21:25,280
Yes, I'm playing with Lego.

7156
05:21:25,280 --> 05:21:27,280
Isn't this what I'm supposed to do?

7157
05:21:27,280 --> 05:21:31,280
The legs bend, doesn't it?

7158
05:21:31,280 --> 05:21:36,280
I've having...

7159
05:21:36,280 --> 05:21:38,280
I have terrible news.

7160
05:21:38,280 --> 05:21:40,280
These do not bend.

7161
05:21:40,280 --> 05:21:43,280
Is yours then?

7162
05:21:43,280 --> 05:21:45,280
These are non-bendable.

7163
05:21:45,280 --> 05:21:48,280
Have I been scummed?

7164
05:21:48,280 --> 05:21:53,280
Is this fake Lego I've been playing with from the last tour?

7165
05:21:53,280 --> 05:21:56,280
I don't think so.

7166
05:21:56,280 --> 05:21:59,280
I'm awful.

7167
05:21:59,280 --> 05:22:00,280
Okay.

7168
05:22:00,280 --> 05:22:02,280
And then he...

7169
05:22:02,280 --> 05:22:03,280
Oot molly.

7170
05:22:03,280 --> 05:22:05,280
Oot molly, ya bam.

7171
05:22:05,280 --> 05:22:06,280
Where did it go?

7172
05:22:06,280 --> 05:22:08,280
The map, there it is.

7173
05:22:08,280 --> 05:22:10,280
He's gonna be holding the map.

7174
05:22:10,280 --> 05:22:11,280
Where did he go?

7175
05:22:11,280 --> 05:22:12,280
Right, there you are.

7176
05:22:12,280 --> 05:22:15,280
Right, hold the map.

7177
05:22:15,280 --> 05:22:16,280
Hold it.

7178
05:22:16,280 --> 05:22:18,280
Hold it.

7179
05:22:18,280 --> 05:22:21,280
In between your fingers, please.

7180
05:22:21,280 --> 05:22:23,280
I'm trying to role-play here.

7181
05:22:23,280 --> 05:22:25,280
How can I role-play?

7182
05:22:25,280 --> 05:22:27,280
You're not literally holding it.

7183
05:22:27,280 --> 05:22:30,280
Surely they designed it to be held.

7184
05:22:30,280 --> 05:22:32,280
Okay, I'll take that.

7185
05:22:32,280 --> 05:22:34,280
Right, so he's at the door and he's like,

7186
05:22:34,280 --> 05:22:35,280
Oot molly.

7187
05:22:35,280 --> 05:22:36,280
And he's like,

7188
05:22:36,280 --> 05:22:38,280
Oh my god, brother, it's been so long.

7189
05:22:38,280 --> 05:22:41,280
Okay, I can't turn him that way.

7190
05:22:41,280 --> 05:22:45,280
And then Gandalf and Buffer are obviously just

7191
05:22:45,280 --> 05:22:47,280
pinching the dungeon man.

7192
05:22:47,280 --> 05:22:48,280
He's like,

7193
05:22:48,280 --> 05:22:50,280
Oh, you didn't part an old man with his walking stick, right?

7194
05:22:50,280 --> 05:22:52,280
And obviously not.

7195
05:22:52,280 --> 05:22:56,280
So Gandalf is the overseeing of everything at the party

7196
05:22:56,280 --> 05:23:00,280
because it's the unexpected party.

7197
05:23:00,280 --> 05:23:02,280
He's like at the edge overseeing it.

7198
05:23:02,280 --> 05:23:03,280
And he's like laughing.

7199
05:23:03,280 --> 05:23:04,280
He's like,

7200
05:23:04,280 --> 05:23:07,280
Oh, Christmas.

7201
05:23:07,280 --> 05:23:12,280
And then Buffer at the front smoking up that zaza.

7202
05:23:12,280 --> 05:23:16,280
He's blowing bubbles, blowing zaza.

7203
05:23:16,280 --> 05:23:20,280
I think they're there for...

7204
05:23:20,280 --> 05:23:22,280
Now don't, right.

7205
05:23:22,280 --> 05:23:23,280
Oh, choose.

7206
05:23:23,280 --> 05:23:26,280
Ray, I think we've done it.

7207
05:23:26,280 --> 05:23:30,280
I think we've done it.

7208
05:23:30,280 --> 05:23:31,280
Who was that?

7209
05:23:31,280 --> 05:23:32,280
I was the baguette.

7210
05:23:32,280 --> 05:23:33,280
Oh, not that right now.

7211
05:23:33,280 --> 05:23:34,280
Stay on the table.

7212
05:23:34,280 --> 05:23:35,280
Okay.

7213
05:23:35,280 --> 05:23:37,280
Glue everything down.

7214
05:23:37,280 --> 05:23:38,280
Okay.

7215
05:23:38,280 --> 05:23:41,280
So Buffer's out at the front smoking the zaza.

7216
05:23:41,280 --> 05:23:42,280
Okay.

7217
05:23:42,280 --> 05:23:43,280
Not bad.

7218
05:23:43,280 --> 05:23:44,280
Not bad.

7219
05:23:44,280 --> 05:23:46,280
And you come in through the gate.

7220
05:23:46,280 --> 05:23:47,280
Oh, he's coming.

7221
05:23:47,280 --> 05:23:48,280
He's coming.

7222
05:23:48,280 --> 05:23:50,280
He's coming through the gate.

7223
05:23:50,280 --> 05:23:52,280
And then the door opens.

7224
05:23:52,280 --> 05:23:53,280
The door shuts.

7225
05:23:53,280 --> 05:23:55,280
Are they in the way?

7226
05:23:55,280 --> 05:23:56,280
Oh, no.

7227
05:23:56,280 --> 05:23:57,280
There's fallen apart.

7228
05:23:57,280 --> 05:23:58,280
Right.

7229
05:23:58,280 --> 05:23:59,280
No.

7230
05:23:59,280 --> 05:24:03,280
I'm playing very quickly with it.

7231
05:24:03,280 --> 05:24:05,280
We're falling apart.

7232
05:24:05,280 --> 05:24:06,280
Help, help.

7233
05:24:06,280 --> 05:24:07,280
Okay.

7234
05:24:07,280 --> 05:24:08,280
And then we go and say...

7235
05:24:08,280 --> 05:24:11,280
And then we have the lovely...

7236
05:24:11,280 --> 05:24:12,280
Okay.

7237
05:24:12,280 --> 05:24:15,280
The food's gone everywhere, but it's okay.

7238
05:24:15,280 --> 05:24:16,280
I'll fix it in a minute.

7239
05:24:16,280 --> 05:24:17,280
Okay.

7240
05:24:17,280 --> 05:24:18,280
No.

7241
05:24:18,280 --> 05:24:19,280
Right.

7242
05:24:19,280 --> 05:24:23,280
And then when you come in, Bilbo is talking to Dwellin and he's got the map and he's like,

7243
05:24:23,280 --> 05:24:24,280
bro, this is what we're doing.

7244
05:24:24,280 --> 05:24:25,280
This is the mission.

7245
05:24:25,280 --> 05:24:27,280
And he's like, and what's this got to do with me?

7246
05:24:27,280 --> 05:24:29,280
I'm just a hobbit and back in, bro.

7247
05:24:29,280 --> 05:24:30,280
And he's like, no, I'm serious.

7248
05:24:30,280 --> 05:24:31,280
Look at all this.

7249
05:24:31,280 --> 05:24:33,280
And they're looking at the map together and that.

7250
05:24:33,280 --> 05:24:35,280
And then...

7251
05:24:35,280 --> 05:24:40,280
Bilbo's just super happy to see him because they're related, if you didn't know.

7252
05:24:40,280 --> 05:24:43,280
And then...

7253
05:24:43,280 --> 05:24:44,280
Bumba.

7254
05:24:44,280 --> 05:24:45,280
It's not Bumba.

7255
05:24:45,280 --> 05:24:46,280
Bombers.

7256
05:24:46,280 --> 05:24:48,280
Bombers eating away, honestly.

7257
05:24:48,280 --> 05:24:52,280
And then that's his little right in here.

7258
05:24:52,280 --> 05:24:56,280
And then that's the lovely fireplace with a frying pan.

7259
05:24:56,280 --> 05:24:58,280
Food and a broom.

7260
05:24:58,280 --> 05:25:00,280
And then...

7261
05:25:00,280 --> 05:25:02,280
We don't have a roof yet.

7262
05:25:02,280 --> 05:25:04,280
Okay, we need some more due to the roof.

7263
05:25:04,280 --> 05:25:09,280
Ma, thank you for the five gifted memberships and congrats to those who cut away your face.

7264
05:25:09,280 --> 05:25:13,280
Hobbits clearly didn't build their houses very well.

7265
05:25:13,280 --> 05:25:14,280
No, these...

7266
05:25:14,280 --> 05:25:17,280
I mean, it's alright.

7267
05:25:17,280 --> 05:25:20,280
If you ignore the fact that there's food all over the floor.

7268
05:25:20,280 --> 05:25:22,280
I think we did alright.

7269
05:25:22,280 --> 05:25:26,280
That was really hard and I'm never doing that again.

7270
05:25:26,280 --> 05:25:30,280
If you're wanting a Lego stream, we're literally doing pieces for three year olds.

7271
05:25:30,280 --> 05:25:34,280
That was for nine and fourteen year olds and I couldn't even finish it.

7272
05:25:34,280 --> 05:25:35,280
And how long?

7273
05:25:35,280 --> 05:25:37,280
Five and a half hours.

7274
05:25:37,280 --> 05:25:38,280
No wonder I'm tired.

7275
05:25:38,280 --> 05:25:41,280
Sorry, I should have been napping long ago.

7276
05:25:41,280 --> 05:25:43,280
Wait, hold up.

7277
05:25:43,280 --> 05:25:45,280
Let me...

7278
05:25:45,280 --> 05:25:47,280
Change your...

7279
05:25:48,280 --> 05:25:50,280
Oh.

7280
05:25:50,280 --> 05:25:53,280
Oh, my body's sore as well.

7281
05:25:53,280 --> 05:25:55,280
Hold on.

7282
05:25:55,280 --> 05:25:57,280
No, I can't laugh yet.

7283
05:25:57,280 --> 05:25:58,280
Okay.

7284
05:25:58,280 --> 05:26:00,280
Hi, I can see you now.

7285
05:26:00,280 --> 05:26:02,280
Hello, sir.

7286
05:26:02,280 --> 05:26:03,280
Hello.

7287
05:26:03,280 --> 05:26:04,280
Do you like...

7288
05:26:04,280 --> 05:26:06,280
What do you think about my...

7289
05:26:06,280 --> 05:26:08,280
My doll?

7290
05:26:08,280 --> 05:26:10,280
My doll? No.

7291
05:26:10,280 --> 05:26:12,280
My Lego set.

7292
05:26:12,280 --> 05:26:14,280
Now set on it?

7293
05:26:14,280 --> 05:26:16,280
Setting on it? That took me far too long.

7294
05:26:16,280 --> 05:26:18,280
I'm not setting on that.

7295
05:26:18,280 --> 05:26:22,280
I'm not even breaking it for the funny ha ha tee hee.

7296
05:26:22,280 --> 05:26:25,280
There's absolutely no way out.

7297
05:26:25,280 --> 05:26:27,280
No way.

7298
05:26:30,280 --> 05:26:33,280
Mummy, the noises you made while you were running your fingers through the night.

7299
05:26:33,280 --> 05:26:34,280
Hi.

7300
05:26:34,280 --> 05:26:36,280
Are you okay?

7301
05:26:36,280 --> 05:26:38,280
Are you having good time?

7302
05:26:38,280 --> 05:26:39,280
Good time.

7303
05:26:39,280 --> 05:26:43,280
Thanks again, Master, the five gifted members of...

7304
05:26:43,280 --> 05:26:45,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

7305
05:26:45,280 --> 05:26:47,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

7306
05:26:47,280 --> 05:26:50,280
Crazy streamer talks to herself for five hours.

7307
05:26:50,280 --> 05:26:52,280
I'm sweating right now.

7308
05:26:52,280 --> 05:26:54,280
It's Goshi.

7309
05:26:54,280 --> 05:26:56,280
Thank you for the extended membership.

7310
05:26:56,280 --> 05:26:57,280
Congrats on the build, Mummy.

7311
05:26:57,280 --> 05:26:58,280
It was a great stream.

7312
05:26:58,280 --> 05:27:00,280
I know it looks like it was really fun.

7313
05:27:00,280 --> 05:27:01,280
Love you.

7314
05:27:01,280 --> 05:27:02,280
Love you to me, Flynn.

7315
05:27:02,280 --> 05:27:03,280
Actually, it looks good.

7316
05:27:03,280 --> 05:27:05,280
It's too bad the food can't be pinned down.

7317
05:27:05,280 --> 05:27:08,280
Yeah, I think people glue their Lego sets.

7318
05:27:08,280 --> 05:27:11,280
Can you hot glue my Lego set?

7319
05:27:14,280 --> 05:27:16,280
It was a relaxing stream.

7320
05:27:16,280 --> 05:27:19,280
This is probably the calmest stream I've ever done.

7321
05:27:19,280 --> 05:27:23,280
I'm nothing but peace and tranquility right now.

7322
05:27:23,280 --> 05:27:27,280
Emmy's up on a...

7323
05:27:27,280 --> 05:27:30,280
Emmy's up streaming, so I'll redirect into Emma's.

7324
05:27:30,280 --> 05:27:32,280
Okay, she's playing Wizard 101.

7325
05:27:32,280 --> 05:27:35,280
I think you can stream like that if I'm not mistaken.

7326
05:27:35,280 --> 05:27:36,280
That set is old.

7327
05:27:36,280 --> 05:27:39,280
Well, that's why the legs don't bend.

7328
05:27:39,280 --> 05:27:42,280
How old is this?

7329
05:27:42,280 --> 05:27:44,280
I don't know how old that set is.

7330
05:27:44,280 --> 05:27:46,280
Hmm.

7331
05:27:46,280 --> 05:27:48,280
It chills me.

7332
05:27:48,280 --> 05:27:50,280
I hope it wasn't too boring.

7333
05:27:50,280 --> 05:27:54,280
I'm like, whoa, what, like, I'm not a disappointment.

7334
05:27:54,280 --> 05:27:56,280
This song came out three hours ago.

7335
05:27:56,280 --> 05:27:58,280
Oh, I did it.

7336
05:27:58,280 --> 05:28:01,280
The Christmas fucking night.

7337
05:28:01,280 --> 05:28:05,280
For tonight, man, I'll pay him.

7338
05:28:05,280 --> 05:28:07,280
I just shit.

7339
05:28:07,280 --> 05:28:09,280
Come on, Emma.

7340
05:28:15,280 --> 05:28:18,280
Can you show different angles of the Lego set up?

7341
05:28:18,280 --> 05:28:20,280
Hmm.

7342
05:28:21,280 --> 05:28:24,280
I showed it, did I not?

7343
05:28:24,280 --> 05:28:25,280
Not really, hold on.

7344
05:28:25,280 --> 05:28:29,280
Oh, my truck ain't gonna get lost yet.

7345
05:28:29,280 --> 05:28:31,280
The food's gonna go everywhere.

7346
05:28:31,280 --> 05:28:36,280
So, like, this is them in the parking.

7347
05:28:36,280 --> 05:28:39,280
And, like, this is the front.

7348
05:28:39,280 --> 05:28:42,280
Ignore all the weapons going everywhere.

7349
05:28:42,280 --> 05:28:45,280
I can't really, like, fit it sideways.

7350
05:28:45,280 --> 05:28:49,280
The set came out in 2012.

7351
05:28:49,280 --> 05:28:51,280
Oh, yeah.

7352
05:28:51,280 --> 05:28:52,280
We did it.

7353
05:28:52,280 --> 05:28:54,280
I'm excited to see them.

7354
05:28:54,280 --> 05:28:56,280
Oh, there goes the weaponry.

7355
05:28:57,280 --> 05:28:59,280
Hmm.

7356
05:28:59,280 --> 05:29:03,280
Not every stream has to be high up here.

7357
05:29:03,280 --> 05:29:06,280
Me is into egg mushrooms this week.

7358
05:29:06,280 --> 05:29:08,280
Oh.

7359
05:29:08,280 --> 05:29:10,280
Are you guys gonna be okay?

7360
05:29:10,280 --> 05:29:12,280
Did I do the roller thing yet?

7361
05:29:12,280 --> 05:29:13,280
Or did I not do it?

7362
05:29:13,280 --> 05:29:15,280
I'll forget to do it.

7363
05:29:15,280 --> 05:29:18,280
I've lost my role.

7364
05:29:18,280 --> 05:29:20,280
Well, it's over for us.

7365
05:29:20,280 --> 05:29:21,280
It's over.

7366
05:29:21,280 --> 05:29:24,280
Okay, I'm gonna redirect into MRIs.

7367
05:29:24,280 --> 05:29:26,280
I'm gonna say I love you.

7368
05:29:26,280 --> 05:29:28,280
I'm sorry, I'm a little sleepyhead right now.

7369
05:29:28,280 --> 05:29:29,280
How many kisses?

7370
05:29:29,280 --> 05:29:32,280
For how many party members there are?

7371
05:29:32,280 --> 05:29:35,280
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

7372
05:29:35,280 --> 05:29:36,280
Six.

7373
05:29:36,280 --> 05:29:38,280
There's only six of them.

7374
05:29:38,280 --> 05:29:40,280
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

7375
05:29:40,280 --> 05:29:43,280
I'm sorry, I'm a sleepyhead today.

7376
05:29:43,280 --> 05:29:44,280
Put it this way.

7377
05:29:44,280 --> 05:29:47,280
I thought the stream was gonna be two hours long.

7378
05:29:47,280 --> 05:29:48,280
I did not expect that.

7379
05:29:48,280 --> 05:29:51,280
I did not expect that at all.

7380
05:29:52,280 --> 05:29:55,280
Let's read our little sister.

7381
05:29:55,280 --> 05:29:57,280
Okay, you got a deal.

7382
05:29:57,280 --> 05:29:59,280
Let me make sure...

7383
05:29:59,280 --> 05:30:01,280
It's definitely gonna read our acting to her

7384
05:30:01,280 --> 05:30:04,280
because it annoys me when it says it's gonna, but it doesn't.

7385
05:30:04,280 --> 05:30:06,280
Yes, I will have a very good nap.

7386
05:30:06,280 --> 05:30:07,280
Thank you.

7387
05:30:07,280 --> 05:30:09,280
I see you tomorrow for some shenanigans.

7388
05:30:09,280 --> 05:30:11,280
What are we doing tomorrow?

7389
05:30:11,280 --> 05:30:13,280
What's going on tomorrow?

7390
05:30:13,280 --> 05:30:14,280
What's going on tomorrow?

7391
05:30:14,280 --> 05:30:15,280
What am I doing tomorrow?

7392
05:30:15,280 --> 05:30:17,280
Chain together solo and then Austin powers.

7393
05:30:17,280 --> 05:30:18,280
Okay, deal.

7394
05:30:18,280 --> 05:30:19,280
I can do that.

7395
05:30:19,280 --> 05:30:22,280
Yes, I can do that.

7396
05:30:22,280 --> 05:30:24,280
I've got a kiss for every leg.

7397
05:30:24,280 --> 05:30:27,280
I'll be here forever.

7398
05:30:27,280 --> 05:30:29,280
Okay, please enjoy Emmy.

7399
05:30:29,280 --> 05:30:31,280
I'm sorry for quite a fast ending.

7400
05:30:31,280 --> 05:30:32,280
I'm gonna lie down.

7401
05:30:32,280 --> 05:30:33,280
I'm sleepy, baby.

7402
05:30:33,280 --> 05:30:39,280
I might be mummy, but sometimes I need baby too.

7403
05:30:39,280 --> 05:30:41,280
Okay, I see you tomorrow.

7404
05:30:41,280 --> 05:30:42,280
Have a good day.

7405
05:30:42,280 --> 05:30:44,280
Make sure to hydrate and sleep.

7406
05:30:44,280 --> 05:30:47,280
And sleep if you need it, okay?

7407
05:30:47,280 --> 05:30:50,280
See you in dreamland if enough, but the same time as me.

7408
05:30:50,280 --> 05:30:52,280
Bye-bye.

7409
05:30:52,280 --> 05:30:54,280
See you later, honey.

7410
05:30:54,280 --> 05:30:56,280
Till tomorrow.
