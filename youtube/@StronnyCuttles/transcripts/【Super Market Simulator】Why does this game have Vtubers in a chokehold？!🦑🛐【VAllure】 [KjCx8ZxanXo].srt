00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,760
channel okay they just wake up and I'm just like it's unlisted I'll unlist it

16
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,600
for Emmy because I know she likes things a certain way but I'll schedule it for

17
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,080
the others because they're just happy like with whoever not saying that he's not

18
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,880
happy I just understand that me likes things done a certain way so what I do

19
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,160
for Emmy is I name it I title it I tag it I describe it do the description for

20
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,200
her and then if she was changing anything she's more welcome to change

21
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,800
anything I came up with a bit of law for us reeflings yeah yeah our nicotine patch

22
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,640
has an internet connection that plays your VODs when you're offline yeah but

23
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,840
it's programmed to stop at your stream time which is why we get needy when

24
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,960
you're one minute late I mean we do have the perfect amount now for us being

25
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,760
needy so honestly I'm not over it

26
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:11,240

43
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,120

44
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,400
thing and like everyone is pleading and begging with this machine to pick them

81
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,980
you've got with book on microchips and I was the only reason I reject that lore

82
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:26,020
is because I am tinfoil huh I'm trying to put audio was amazing need to know

83
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:32,300
I think on Twitter if it's an artwork theme I want to ask I want to voice act

84
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,900
isn't there someone you forgot to ask oh we're out in the random payment for

85
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,900
the sensor honestly I wasn't able to participate in yesterday's educational

86
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,900
stream what did you miss you missed a prototype for streamings that I might do

87
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,540
in the future and there was a surprise pop quiz at the end but I gave you a hint

88
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,980
that there was a quiz at the end because at the start I said write your name at

89
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,340
the top of the paper and I actually had some reeflings genuinely like write down

90
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,740
their answers and show me and I was like oh my god this is the most adorable

91
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,420
thing I've ever seen in my life I love my life I love my reeflings everything is

92
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,300
good everything cool when you're part of the team you missed the biology

93
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,260
sociology exam and then a random lore dump about how the production of the

94
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,620
Hobbit was an absolute nightmare and I won't accept any Hobbit slander and

95
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:29,380
Toriel as well and all that I'm almost finished my tea I made a shit tea today

96
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:35,260
but then all the games at the top would just be

97
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:45,740
right so supermarket simulator apparently it's early access I don't know and I've

98
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,980
seen a lot of vtubers play it and you know we're just needing some casual

99
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:55,140
games I am going to be so depressed next week I should know my dad is already

100
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:01,420
he's just got here what kind of tea is everyday English breakfast tea or black

101
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:07,180
tea from other areas of the planet but we call it everyday English

102
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:15,900
breakfast tea and so apparently this is an infinite type of scenario so I don't

103
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:23,100
really know what's gonna happen now I don't know what we're gonna do we need

104
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,180
some milk on the shelves immediately well I have a clip of Azura playing this

105
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,100
game coming out and it was hilarious because the concept artist created an

106
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:38,860
asset in order to do this short and I swear to God if the short doesn't pop

107
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,020

welcome good morning thank you for your custom thank you for supporting a

404
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:45,040
local business instead of a conglomerate of a monopoly yes thank you I'm just a

405
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:52,120
little guy I pay taxes did you know that when you're fucking when you know when

406
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:58,160
supermarkets prompt you to donate don't ever do it they claim that as their

407
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,440
taxes because they get a tax rebate on a donation and they put it against the

408
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:08,040
taxes they should be paying but because they're a freaking conglomerate thank you

409
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,080
for supporting a small business do appreciate you oh oh big order thank

410
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:17,400
you what do you need $5 change there is that was our biggest sale yet thank you

411
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,400
paying taxes and my strongy stream this man loves this cereal donations are

412
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:30,080
tax loopholes so whenever fast food joint that is massive or a supermarket

413
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:35,480
that is massive goes would you like to donate to the starving children no but

414
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,600
not for that reason okay you're allowed to donate in general but not via the

415
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:46,120
supermarket because they use it as a freaking tax rebate okay so don't don't

416
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:51,320
support via the supermarket if you want to support in general that's fine but

417
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,400
say now let them kids starve they're literally guilt-tripping you let them

418
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:04,680
motherfuckers yes if you really wanted to donate to directly to charity but the

419
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,760
biggest way I think the biggest way you can help out the community is

420
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:14,920

449
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:24,300
How... what am I... am I playing this game wrong? I'm getting... I'm getting... I'm getting nervous.

450
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,780
Why is everything going horrifically wrong? Where everyone's getting the shot right now.

451
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:33,820
How much is a fridge? Furnit your... shelves?

452
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:39,420
A display fridge? A fridge single. Another $200?

453
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:44,060
Oh that's quite a tall order, sorry. But like, look at my... how...

454
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:49,900
I'm to get a fridge on flour alone. Good morning. Please tell me you don't want anything out of the...

455
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,940
Okay, that's fine. You're allowed pasta. I... I give you permission to have pasta.

456
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,940
Thank you for your custom. Here's a dollar change.

457
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:06,940
I don't sell cheese! There's no indication of cheese being sold in the shop.

458
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:14,060
You're not allowed to ask for products, ma'am, that we don't sell. Miss, get back here. I will fistfight

459
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:19,500
you in the back in the parking lot. Get back here. We don't sell cheese. There's no indication we

460
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,980
should be selling cheese. Do you know what my license is? Are you the person I bought the

461
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:31,180
freaking license from? Relax. It's not that serious. It honestly isn't. Oh, I can't even find the cheese.

462
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:35,420
Yeah, nay, shite. There's nay fucking fridges. Of course there's nay cheese. Do you know how hot

463
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:38,780
it is outside? Like, honestly, the whole world doesn't revolve around you, ma'am.

464
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:45,260
Strong behavior. I didn't know... I didn't know they were allowed to be demanding, like,

465
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,700
oh, but she could sell cheese. Now, it'd be different if they were like, oh, I can't wait

466
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:55,180
for you to expand to sell cheese, but oh, there's nay cheese. Of course there's nay cheese. Are you

467
00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:00,940
gonna pay for the fridge? It's 200 quid. I've not got 200 quid via flour sales unless you want to,

468
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:05,660
like, open up a bakery and use me as your supply chain. Sure, you can complain then,

469
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:11,740
but are you freaking kidding me? Like, honestly, that absolute cheek of some folk.

470
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:17,980
Good afternoon, sir. Sorry about that outburst. I was just talking to my co-worker on the headset.

471
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:24,940
I promise I wasn't having a random mental health breakout burst. Right, we are gonna need more

472
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:31,020
products. Just shove anything in here. Right, we can't sell cheese because everything needs water.

473
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:42,060
Eh, I need a shelf apparently. No, not right now! Okay. Could you imagine a customer and we're just

474
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:48,620
going, you can take your money back by right-clicking on the bills on the cash register. Oh, did I make

475
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:55,340
a mistake? I don't know. Change a dollar. Did I make a mistake? Couldn't find the sliced bread.

476
00:47:55,340 --> 00:48:04,620
Yeah, because I don't sell it! Jeez. Jeez, you guys are like so needy, honestly. Right, bread?

477
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:13,260
You want bread? What, you want cereal? Cereal's $41? Oh my lord, I don't have that kind of money.

478
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:22,140
Oh my god, I need to hire someone else to do the machines, honestly. Insufficient change.

479
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:31,660
How do I put it back? Put it back. Put it back. Close checkout, approve. Back. How do I put it back? Oh no.

480
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:41,340
What? What do you need? Giving $7? Right, hold on. Let me do it like this. Sorry, sorry. Hold on.

481
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:46,860
Bink, won't bink. Okay, sorry. I hadn't. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Couldn't find the milk. Fond de la bosom.

482
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:54,300
Tomato tomato. Just, just enjoy the stock for what it's worth, honestly. I ain't got time. I don't have

483
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:59,500
time. I need to hire someone else to do this. Reflens, will you come work in a convenience store

484
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:04,540
with me? I need your help. I don't have time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The cheese. Why is

485
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:09,580
everyone addicted to cheese? I thought you were all lactose intolerant by like 50% of the nation

486
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:15,820
become, who knocked over my packages? I thought everyone becomes lactose intolerant like so quickly.

487
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,860
Okay, drop. Just shove it on the floor. Good afternoon. Hello, thank you for your custom.

488
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:25,820
You would like $2 change. Oh, here it is. Thank you, veiler lover for the extended membership. Just

489
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:32,140
imagine these are needy reeflings waiting for your next audio, honestly. Everyone like excited

490
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:38,860
for the next audio and then it's me with a dick. Oh, everyone was like absolutely like, oh, so

491
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:44,780
disappointed. Oh, thank you for the exact change, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Who is knocking over

492
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:54,700
my packages? Please don't do that. Can I restock? No, I put it on the bottom shelf. I suck. No,

493
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:59,260
I'm not ready yet. I'm not ready yet. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Gee, shove

494
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:07,740
on the floor. Hello. Good afternoon. Bing, bing, bing. All yours. All yours, baby. I'm restocking

495
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:13,500
whilst on the job. I'm actually so good at this. Sorry. I'm such a good multitasker. Did you know

496
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:18,700
that it is a common misconception that women can multitask more, but actually it's just practice

497
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:23,740
behavior because yeah, you can't, I don't sell tea. I didn't know they could be so cheeky and ask

498
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:28,620
for stuff I didn't even sell, honestly. I've got nothing but the cheek you lot do, honestly,

499
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:32,540
honestly, honestly. I'm on to you. I'm on to you. Didn't think I'm on to you. Sorry, I need to clean

500
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:37,100
up the storage. Excuse me, sir. Sorry, just a moment. Just a moment. Can you run in this game?

501
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:41,100
That'd be really helpful. Don't ding that bell. Don't ding the bell on the register. I'm just

502
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:48,540
about to be there. Please give me a second. Thank you. Buy a boh here. I bet him buy a boh here.

503
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:52,540
I know you couldn't find the bottled water because it's in a package that you'll never know about.

504
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:54,460
No.

505
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:06,780
I'm just buying everything. Okay. I'm here and the lights are getting Friday nights and the lights

506
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:16,300
are low. Hold on. I need to put the lights on. It's so dark, my lady. That audio is not my cup

507
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:21,260
of tea, but I'm still gonna listen to it. Are you even though you don't like it? Thank you.

508
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:26,780
It's not for everyone. It's not for everyone, but I do have some outrageous

509
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:31,660
audios coming out soon. Thank you, Broly Legend for the tip and for giving it a shot. I mean,

510
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:35,980
some people are like, so they're like, I would never listen to this. It's disgusting. I'm like,

511
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:40,780
bro, relax. I'm literally pretending to have a willy. It's not that serious.

512
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:47,260
What do you mean you don't want me to clap your cheeks? If reeflings come work for you,

513
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:52,460
you require good benefits. You can't provide those right? Winking face.

514
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:59,740
What kinds of benefits would you like anonymous is the question? I mean, there's not as long as

515
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:08,140
you don't report it to HR. There's not much that I'm not happy with, you know? $9, $5, 1, 1, 1, 1. Boom.

516
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:15,580
If I read cheese one more time, I'm gonna shove cheese up someone's arse.

517
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:21,340
Let's just very quickly purchase all this shit and then I can put it on the shelves.

518
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:27,660
Oh, no, let's stay open because there's a customer. Open.

519
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:33,580
I was anything but disappointed with the latest audio,

520
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:39,740
Mama. In fact, I was elated that I had the house to myself so I could use my new figureine to it.

521
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,660
No. My figureine died, though, and I have to try again another day.

522
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:44,860
No.

523
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,020
Your figure died?

524
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:55,900
I would love to work in your store, Mama. I'll handle the heavy packages as long as you handle my heavy package.

525
00:52:56,620 --> 00:53:00,860
You don't even have to pay me. I just want to ogle at my little seed.

526
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,820
Okay, that was actually really good. I'll give you that. That was really good.

527
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:10,780
God, some late night shoppers, huh? Burning the midday oil. Go home.

528
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:20,700
Jeez. Oh my. What? How? It must be because they're spawning around the corner.

529
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:26,620
Jeez, you guys don't love your families? My goodness. Thank you so much. Anonymous.

530
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:33,580
I have really weak wrists and hands, so unironically, I will take that help. I'm so freaking weak.

531
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:38,780
I'm a weakling, okay? I'm a weakling. A weak little seaweed. It's shocking behavior.

532
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:45,180
The Rizzler. Thank you. Orvon Biscuit as well. How did it die is my question.

533
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:56,300
And what? How did it die? It's got a... Not that word. It's got a battery in it. Is that my question?

534
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:05,180
What was that meme that it's like, oh, so a woman can have a d-d-d-d-d-9000, but if I have a d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-x

535
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:11,180
elemental pee, I'm the weird one. What is that meme that has just reminded me of that meme? I can't

536
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:15,500
remember it though. Family who sent them to the corner. Oh my god, my mom used to send me the

537
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:19,740
corner shop to get cigarettes all the time. Actually, I will say one thing about the Belgians.

538
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:25,500
You guys are so nice, because I didn't have my ID in this Belgian lady. Let me buy cigarettes.

539
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,020
And she was like, you look too young. And I'm like, hee hee, but I'm from Scotland though.

540
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,180
I was like, I'm from Scotland, so no one's going to get you in trouble.

541
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:37,740
And like, I literally started speaking to her and I was like, yeah, I don't speak Dutch. I'm not

542
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:47,660
from here. I literally just need cigarettes. Smile. Thank you, Maycule, for becoming a member. I

543
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:54,060
appreciate it. I'm sorry for butchering your name. Please forgive me. Right, tomorrow we can purchase

544
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:59,900
the fridge. So our beloved package of, that's just, that's being chilling in the corner. Right,

545
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:05,340
we can have cheese tomorrow. Okay, let's go to bed. Oh wait, no, do we have bills?

546
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:15,820
Alone? No, we're not taking out a loan. We hate the banks. Oh my god, 67 cents. Wait, every day

547
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:24,700
it's gonna cost me 20 bucks. Judy, that's rough. I don't make 70 bucks on every purchase. Right,

548
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:33,820
new name, new date. Stop, I'm getting ready to write that plot. Stop, you're getting me ready

549
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:37,740
to write that plot. Oh, don't think I won't do it. Don't think I won't write that plot. That's

550
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:41,740
absolutely hilarious. Oh, I like a little guard as well. I don't even notice I've got a little guard

551
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:47,900
to protect me from the customers from this side. I will literally thank you for the tip and honest.

552
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:52,940
I will write that. Please don't think I won. I'm literally, I love like freaking plots that we do

553
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:58,540
together. It's my favorite thing. This woman truly will do it. Do it, you won't know boss. Shake bag

554
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:06,060
if you didn't. Shake bag if you didn't. Don't throw it at us with a good time. Hello, any customers?

555
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:13,420
Are you my first customer? Actually, I've never even, we must be in New York because those things

556
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:19,580
like the fire exit things always look like they're from New York. Oh, we have a customer. Are you

557
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:27,820
squidding me right now? Hi, mama. I just tuned in. I just wanted to say you stole my heart during

558
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:34,060
yesterday's stream when you read my morrow before you logged off. Turning on your hypno eyes and

559
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:39,580
talking about control was so unbelievably hot. Now I really want to ink in your clown.

560
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:45,180
I mean, I can make something like that. Are you squidding me right now? Oh, honestly, I can.

561
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:50,780
Don't think I won. Yes, it had a battery. I thought it would work better than the unpowered ones I

562
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:55,420
tried in the past, but didn't find enjoyable using them by myself. Oh, we're getting a live review.

563
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:58,300
I need mommy's help to enjoy my cheeks being clapped.

564
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,940
That is terrible. Amazing. Thank you.

565
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,300
Oh, thank you for the tip anonymous and out of on biscuit.

566
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:18,540
No, so obviously, I can't really make anything and I can't record new ASMR until my dad goes away,

567
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:22,540
but he goes away next week. I'm actually going to be so depressed. So don't be surprised when I

568
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:27,180
when I stream and for like 12 hours, and then I'm like, I don't want to go offline because

569
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:31,420
I don't want to be sad in my emotions the moment I go offline because like I'm never sad when I'm

570
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:37,820
like streaming to you. And like I'm always happy like just like having the time of my life. So I

571
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:42,300
just know I'm going to be so depressed, but I'm happy on stream. But as soon as I end stream,

572
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:48,300
like it's literally going to be that meme where it's like with the music, like I'm not going to

573
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:52,860
I'm not going to be having a good time next week, but you guys will make it that have a good time.

574
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:59,100
And you know, I know you guys will make a good time. So I need just as needed as we fling.

575
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:03,420
I mean, I think that's why we work so well together. We fling. I mean,

576
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:08,140
you know, you don't report me to HR. We do some things in the break room, you know,

577
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:13,740
I don't report you for something, something, something, something, something.

578
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:18,700
I am happy to help you in the shop. And as payment all I ask is that you give me some

579
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:23,980
cream like you did in the recent order. Honestly, do you want some creamer for your

580
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:29,980
coffee in the morning at my supermarket? We'll call it. What would we call it? Oh, you can't rename

581
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:39,660
it. Oh, I thought what is city gates? City gates. Um, I what would we name the shop though? If we

582
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:47,180
had one. Squid ink. A dollar for you, madam. Thank you for your custom. Right. We're at 100

583
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:53,900
bucks. We just need a few more sales, please. Squirts. You want, you want this supermarket

584
00:58:53,900 --> 00:59:05,020
to be called squirts? Oh no, this can't be. You can see ink. Coldstone creamery. I'm not sure

585
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:11,820
we're going to get a wave. Although, can we make one of those cringy American ads? Jones, barbecue

586
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:19,260
foot massage. And then our version is like, uh, Strone and Reflings, Inc. Emporium or something

587
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:26,700
like that. I don't know what we'd call it. Ink mark. Well, like ink mark. Strone and Reflings,

588
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:34,380
ink mark. Come on down to get your things. Come on down to get your things. We're anti-capitalist,

589
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:39,980
but we still have to participate in society. But it's okay because our prices are lower than

590
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:49,740
the monopolies. That's our theme song. It's like the worst jingle you could imagine. And everyone's

591
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:59,500
like, why did they put ads into this? This is awful. Honestly. Thank you. Oil, oil, oil. I know

592
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:05,660
you Americans like your oil. Take it. Take all my oil. Right, $137. We're almost there. Thank you

593
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:15,820
for your purchases. $17. Oh, nope. I almost messed up so bad. Sir, you have no idea how much I

594
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:20,540
about overcharged you. You're so welcome. I was on it. Are you squidding me right now? You charged

595
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:27,020
him $0.09? Hi, Mama. I remembered you once said that Reflings are able to hypno you just like

596
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:33,340
you can hypno us. Yes. Can you teach us how? A mind broken straw knee would be amazing to see,

597
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:39,020
to see our cheeky little less get addicted to Reflings ink. I'm already addicted to,

598
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:42,460
you only send a man of marshmallows. I demand marshmallows.

599
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:52,460
So technically you can hypnotize me at any time, but in my head, I've done it that you prefer to do

600
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:58,300
it via a mirror because you like when I do it to myself, like it's more satisfying for you

601
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:02,460
that way. I'm not going to run out of freaking things. Thank you for the hypno.

602
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:09,580
Top tier servicing. No matter how big or small, we work until you're satisfied.

603
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:15,020
And I don't think the work is talking about the average nine of five.

604
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:26,780
Call it ink and drink. Thank you. Lars the dude for the tip. Yeah, I'm not convinced you're talking

605
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:31,900
about the average nine to five work. I think we're talking about another kind of work. You know what

606
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:44,860
I'm saying? How's the weather in Australia? Are you okay Reflings? Did you get a little

607
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:51,900
nervous typing that out? Thank you for letting me pop your super cherry. Oh, no, no, you're,

608
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:55,900
I said that wrong. I said that wrong. Sorry. Other me. Thank you for letting me pop your

609
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:01,740
super cherry. No, you're super cherry. I'm so sorry. That sounded like an insult. I didn't mean

610
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:16,060
it like that. It's winter. So it's cold. It's cold. Okay, eight dollars. Did that charge anything

611
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:19,660
for that? Did I just let you walk out for free? I think I did. I think I messed that up.

612
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:28,140
Your mega chair, your super mega cherry is main boy. You're not getting away from me that easily.

613
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:37,420
Right. Okay, we're done. We can buy a fridge. I assume I can buy a fridge or do I need to do it in

614
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:45,020
the morning? Here is the fridge. A mini fridge. Okay. Oh crap. I have to do it in the morning.

615
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:50,220
We'll also add a product into it. What are we missing?

616
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:59,100
Oh my God, please. You're welcome to buy anything you like. Buy everything. Yes, yes. Okay, I'll

617
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:04,140
take it. Three items are better than one. You know what I'm saying? Thank you for your custom. I

618
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:11,340
couldn't find sushi, even cheese. How come you didn't mention that you can speak French? Because I

619
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:18,140
can't. I can say like one or two sentences and I can throw stuff together. It's pretty much it.

620
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:25,660
I can't actually speak French. I can say like, oh, je voudrais, you know, tabit. I can ask for

621
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:33,180
your cock. I can ask for your horse in French. To say butt in French, you say cool. Thank you,

622
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:38,860
dindle shit, 500. What a name for the super chat, by the way. You're super chat cherry.

623
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:43,420
Yeah, to say your butt, you say mon cul. Are you squiddling me right now?

624
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:50,620
So, Strani, if we already have the capability to hypno you, does that mean we can turn on mind

625
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:56,540
broken Strani whenever we want? Do we snap our fingers? Say a certain phrase?

626
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:02,860
Um, so if you've ever looked, ah, you know what? I'll show you. This is my loading screen. Look at

627
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:06,860
you in the loading screen. Oh wait, this is my ending screen. I know you can still hear me in this,

628
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:16,380
but yeah, you can. See how you're on my head right now in here? Wait for it. Wait for it.

629
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:26,140
Look at you. Look at you on the top of my head. Ready, steady. We both have hypnosis.

630
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:32,860
Look, you have the hair thing like I do. Yeah, you got the little hair thing,

631
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:39,580
little hypnotic thing. Yeah, it's real. That's you. You can do that to me and I can do it to you.

632
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:44,620
I forgot which gaming thing I was on. Like I'm on this one. Oh, where's my game?

633
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:54,060
Well, we're not doing that again. That was scary, please. That scared me. Right,

634
01:04:54,060 --> 01:05:00,140
we've got a fridge and we've got 13 bucks so we can order bread and then tomorrow we can purchase it.

635
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:06,540
Okay, and it's only $2 for delivery. That's fantastic. Closed. New day. New day. Right,

636
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:12,540
we're going to very quick. Products found expensive, so is, but no from the, not from around here,

637
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:21,580
partner, not from around here. Right, hold on. Give me the fridge right now. It's a fridge. Oh my

638
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:33,580
head, rotate with mouse wheel. Okay, can I slot you right here? Oh my god. Display is full. Wait,

639
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:41,420
the fridge is tiny. She said she was 12. Sorry, I said it like that. Hold on. Open. No, draft.

640
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:47,740
Some products went down in price but you didn't follow. How dare they? They're making,

641
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:51,580
they're making a mockery of me. They're making a mockery. Right, I only have two dollars. Right,

642
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:58,140
let's set a price for the water. Water. Market price is $2.13, so we'll do two bucks. What are you?

643
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:04,700
We need to lower the oil. Of course, I invest in tons of oil in the games like, yeah, we're

644
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:09,180
going to just artificially lower the price. Right, bread's up at four bucks. Yeah, nine.

645
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:15,180
What's flour? Okay, flour's fine. Flour's fine, don't worry about it. Okay, hydration check,

646
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:26,940
reeflings. Hydration check. Hydration.

647
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:41,340
I'm gonna burp okay. Open your mouth, reefling. Open wide. All yours, baby. Good boy for opening

648
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:46,860
your mouth. It's fucking disgusting. That's actually disgusting. You know what, you know what

649
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:51,500
the worst part is when I do something like that, like a gag like that? Oh, hit me on one.

650
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:56,460
Hi, I'm a first-time customer for this establishment and I was wondering if you

651
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:02,380
sold any exotic items. Maybe a dog, collar, and bowl. Sound familiar, Stronny?

652
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:10,300
Okay, if you didn't know, I may or may not have an alternative Twitter account, okay,

653
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:18,460
and I may or may not have purchased a collar. Oh, give me that back. Oh, you know what,

654
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:25,500
fuck it, you can have it for free. Thanks for your custom. I may or may not have bought a dog

655
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:31,660
bowl and a dog collar with your name on it because you own me. So some people were like,

656
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:41,420
oh, you need to put like Stronny on it. But if you own me, I should technically have your name

657
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:52,300
on me. So I have a bowl coming with your name on it. And that's, I don't know if the collar's

658
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:57,340
going to say property of refling or just refling. I hope it says property of refling because I'm

659
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:04,300
going to come so fucking hard whenever I, you guys are getting the audio where you can literally

660
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:10,620
hear it like jingling on my chest. Or maybe I should put it on and then you can hear me put it on.

661
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:19,420
I like it. Bit bread, bit bread, a little dollar change for you ma'am. Stronny, what? No, Ms. Mano,

662
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:27,260
you're not supposed to be here. Ms. Mano, Ms. Mano, I'm just, I'm confessing, Ms. Mano, I'm confessing.

663
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:35,500
The accuser, purchase a new section in your computer. I heard all that. No, Ms. Mano,

664
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:41,500
that's even more embarrassing. Oh, I'm just gonna, I need to expand growth.

665
01:08:53,020 --> 01:09:01,900
I could probably change it. I have enough time. Did I goof? Shit. Did I mess that up? Am I supposed

666
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:12,220
to be strong on it? Am I that brain dead? The answer, yes. I unknowingly pulled up to the freaky

667
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:18,540
store apparently. Stop. No, this is Squid Mart. Welcome to Squid Mart where all your needs are

668
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:27,900
met. Are you okay? Ma'am? Oh my God, is she okay? Are you okay, ma'am? Ma'am? What do you need?

669
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,420
Are you being assigned? I think she's been assigned something on the shelf.

670
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:40,300
I'll help the AI. Don't worry, I'm here. Oh, oh, she, I didn't know they had, you know,

671
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:45,100
crackheads in this game. That's terrible. Do not use such derogatory terms for people who are

672
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:51,020
afflicted with the older addiction. That's terrible. I don't think she's feeling that good,

673
01:09:51,020 --> 01:10:01,660
I'm gonna be honest. Oh, my needs, go on. Can't make up her mind. Thank you, tiny spiny for the

674
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:06,860
tip. Okay, I will get that changed. There's more than enough time. I promise there's more than

675
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:11,900
enough because I only just did it. So I'm sure I can like change it because it gets custom made and

676
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:15,740
they had like a big warning that was like, oh, you need to give us like plenty of time.

677
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:28,060
And vitamins to ensure our inks of THR best quality and potency. You only get two days a month after

678
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:36,700
all. Squid mark for all your inking needs. Not you guys learning. Oh, reluctantly saying that was

679
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:43,180
such a good bit. I love that. Not you guys learning about ovulation. Thanks to me. Oh, are you guys

680
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:49,020
okay? God, there's two now. What have I done wrong? I'm not sure what I've done wrong, if I'm being

681
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:53,660
honest. Right, the light's going on now. So this place isn't freaking dark. And you just put it on

682
01:10:53,660 --> 01:11:01,580
all the time. Damn, you and Belgan called it. She's undecided on what's a better product.

683
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:05,420
Bro, they're literally, I don't, the AI is having a hard time with the oil right now.

684
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:13,020
I'm not really sure why. Come on, AI. Look at them heels though, heels. Oh, and they put in

685
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:17,740
height differences. Honestly, this has been quite a decent bit of, considering this is early access,

686
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:24,860
I mean, I would say it's pretty polished. Am I, am I going crazy? I know I shouldn't encourage,

687
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:37,580
but if it's not like a mega-cabillion thingy, I don't think it's actually a bad rate. If you

688
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:43,980
two, are you two, can you get out of me right now? Don't listen to them. I like property of

689
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:48,780
reefling on the collar. I can imagine giving it a little tug and pull you in for a deep,

690
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:55,260
passionate kiss and a hard spank to your cuttlefish arse. Be a good little pet for me, strongy.

691
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:59,580
Are you squiddin' me right now? Right, well, I get two versions. I can get two versions. No cheese,

692
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:07,660
one star review. Stop. I'm working on the cheese, okay? A customer's out the, you guys weren't there

693
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:15,500
for ages. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I can't read chat. Oh, no, no. Fuck it. Take it. Take the change.

694
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:20,940
You're welcome. Oh, you're going to complain after I give you extra change? Go away. Thank you so much.

695
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:31,420
Red flame kraadin. Kraadin? Where are you from? Kraadin. Red flame kraadin. What? Why do I think

696
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:34,540
you're European? That's right. I've sussed you out. I'm coming to your house. What are you going to

697
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:40,700
do about it? I can just shortchange that person. You're selling a product without... Oh, and you

698
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:46,060
would buy four of them. I've not set the price. Oh, jeez. How do you do this? Oh my god. Oh my god.

699
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:50,220
I've not set the price. Don't go for the cheese. Don't go for the cheese. Don't go for the cheese.

700
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:54,940
I've not set the price. Cheese. Three bucks. Go. Of course you'd buy the fucking cheese.

701
01:12:57,180 --> 01:13:03,740
I've not set the price. Your mum, yeah? Customer Greg? No way your name is actually

702
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:08,860
customer Greg. Please tell me you changed that to do that super chat. Is your name actually

703
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:17,820
customer Greg? That's your online handle. That's hilarious. Thank you for your one star review.

704
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:22,620
I'm trying my best, okay? Couldn't find the black... That's what I think about you, honestly. I'm fucking

705
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:27,820
getting tired of this shit. Everyone's so needy for a product I don't sell and they should have no

706
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:37,660
indication that I freaking sell it, honestly. Snowberries. Skippity. Why did you put on skippity?

707
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:46,140
That's going to be stuck in my head now. No, don't type that. Hi, snowberries. How is acicle stream?

708
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:52,700
Was she having fun with you? Was she tormenting you? Was she teasing you? Was she pleasing you?

709
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:59,580
That's what I like to hear. How could this delicious brat be so

710
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:10,860
gorgeous? Yeah, actually it's the other way around to do. I think the tormenting was the other way

711
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:18,300
around. You tormenting my precious little acicle? How dare you? Unless she likes it and that's

712
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:25,980
different. Well, there's cars in this game. I mean, in all honesty, what do they have to do

713
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:36,540
to polish off this game? I mean, the method seems to work of the shop. Am I going crazy

714
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:40,060
and saying that this game really isn't that bad? Storage? I'm not going to bother with that. Just

715
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:45,260
seems like $800 for nothing. I don't know. Maybe it comes more... Is this a staff room?

716
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:50,860
Unironically, is this a toilet? This is where me and the reeflings go after a long day.

717
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:58,540
It's just a helping hand. It's levitating. Look at that PC. What are the specs?

718
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:05,660
There's a 1080 inside that for ordering stuff? Why do businesses get all the tax rebates? Why

719
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:10,140
can't I like an average show? I was in the snowys earlier and I came over here when your stream

720
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:17,580
started because I haven't seen a second of a velar stream before today. Oh, no. Oh, no. You picked

721
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:23,900
the worst. Don't start with me. Start with anyone else in velar. I'm the worst fucking choice to start

722
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:28,780
your velar experience with because I'm wildly inappropriate at all times. Are you squinting

723
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:33,580
me right now? Wildly inappropriate at all times. Since you seemed so excited about the property

724
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:39,340
of reeflings part, maybe the caller can say that and the bowl has your name so you know it's your

725
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:45,420
bowl that we let you use when you're hungry for ink. Either way, it's about what gets you going more.

726
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:56,300
I think, why is it 55 bucks for that? Better be a big moneymaker. I think we're gonna get both.

727
01:15:56,300 --> 01:16:01,340
You're super wholesome. Oh, yeah. I'm the one of the few Americans who can understand the Scottish

728
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:09,420
accent. Like, I'm very lucky that you guys can understand it, but I do confess you're not gonna

729
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:20,620
like this part reefling. I purposefully annunciate more. I'm sorry. I do. It's just a tooth. Oh,

730
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:25,340
shit. I hate when I do that honestly. Are you squinting me right now? Oh, that was a lot of product.

731
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:32,220
Do you sell puppy tails? I need the plug type in three different training sizes. My cuttlefish

732
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:36,380
puppy girl is getting uppity and needs some correction via banal training.

733
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:47,020
Okay, I may actually be buying that soon as well. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I think I'm going to be

734
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:55,980
buying that soon. I need a new one. Okay, I need a new one. Thank you Anonymous for the tip and

735
01:16:55,980 --> 01:17:02,300
thank you Zarian as well. I might be getting that product. All right, I didn't want to be outrageous,

736
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:07,820
but I kind of want to show you guys all the things I want to buy in like a week's time,

737
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:12,460
but it's going to be really bad. Like, it's going to be really fucking bad. Excuse me, Ms.

738
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:19,100
where do you keep the cucumbers and the lube? Why you ask for no reason? I'm sure. Hold on,

739
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:29,660
Anonymous. I'm sure I've seen that meme that is like by bomb bombs, by a cucumber and by lube and

740
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:35,820
then look the cashier dead in the eyes while you do it. Are you squinting me right now? For no particular

741
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:42,940
reason. Does this mean Stronny will be getting a tail soon? To go with the collar, we need to make

742
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:48,140
sure the collar is nice and tight around her neck so you can always feel like reeflings are

743
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:52,140
gripping your throat and telling you to behave. Are you squinting me right now? I'm trying to do

744
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:56,380
my job here, not get away. What the fuck's going on? Hi, Stronny just wanted to let you know I walk

745
01:17:56,380 --> 01:18:01,980
my dog every day, but it makes me sad because I wish it was in his tent. Oh my god. I'm going to need

746
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:07,900
a slippery caution, slippery one wet sign on the floor in a minute. What the fuck? We're not getting

747
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:13,820
sued, okay? We're not getting sued because someone had a little fumble. I'm not having it. Whoa, what

748
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:18,060
did I just give you? Ten bucks? Okay, that was really lucky. I still don't know how to retract

749
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:23,820
the money. I've yet to figure it out. Stronny, if you put them on throne, would be happy to buy it

750
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:31,820
for you? Oh, I don't know. I find it so hard to accept gifts like that. I don't know.

751
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:38,940
Like, I don't mind buying it. Am I weird for considering you're fairly normal and wholesome?

752
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:45,580
I mean, for the most part, you know, we've been chaining, don't you mind? I don't think, um,

753
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:51,980
flower is too expensive. I'm so sorry. My flower does not reflect today's prices. No, it does not

754
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:59,500
get aim. Two dollars for the flower. I apologize, my good sir. All yours, no change. Thank you for

755
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:08,540
your exact card. Yes, 19 dollars. Awesome degeneracy is what my wife and I call it,

756
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:13,740
honestly. Stronny with a short color refill. Well, I have a short color stream coming up

757
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:18,940
very quickly. So basically, there's going to be multiple streams for a little while.

758
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:29,180
So don't be surprised if some of them are outrageous. I'm literally going to have to explain

759
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:35,900
to my dad that I'm doing a ring fit stream. So whatever he overhears, if he is awake, he is to

760
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:44,620
ignore because I'm going to be like a bus of ass. I have not exercised since debut. No, I am not

761
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:50,780
exaggerating. Bro, I'm getting you stuck in, man. Give me a chance to have some freaking stock. Right,

762
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:57,420
we need more stock of something. I don't know what yet. Cheese, milk, dark roast coffee is how

763
01:19:58,220 --> 01:20:03,260
right. We'll get eggs as well. We've not had eggs. I'm getting a variety. I promise I'm getting

764
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:09,580
a variety. I promise. This puppy cuttlefish is going to need a muzzle to keep her quiet when

765
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:18,700
reeflings breed her like a bitch in heat. I'm at my job and you're in my earpiece telling me these

766
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:22,700
kinds of things. How am I supposed to look these customers in the eye and say have a good day?

767
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:29,820
I am trembling. I am quaking at this till right now. I'm trying my hardest to focus.

768
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:37,180
I am trying my hardest to focus and I'm quaking right now. It must be placed in a fridge. Okay,

769
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:43,580
that's fine. Oh my god, that is so sad. Pop that there because I want to make sure,

770
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:49,020
I want to make sure, okay. Mummy, now you know how all the reeflings who listen to you at work

771
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:53,660
still, it's still my favorite thing. Sorry, I'm making an audio for it. I don't care. I'm sorry.

772
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:58,140
I'm sorry. I don't care. I need to make an audio for it. I need you. I have a matey.

773
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:06,300
Don't buy the coffee. I've not set the price. Nine dollars. That's a big profit. Three dollars

774
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:14,940
per unit sold. I'm doing it right now. Whoa, this is our biggest freaking thing ever. Thank you.

775
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:23,660
Thirty two dollars. The pleasure is all mine. I assure you the pleasure is all mine. Why is

776
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:30,780
of course. Cheeky dollar change. All yours sir. Thank you. Thank you. Whoa. Okay, let's get that

777
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:35,340
light on. I can already see it getting dark. Don't think I don't know your games. Not again.

778
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:41,180
Why are they struggling? Are you squiddin' me right now? With a pathing. What's the problem? The next

779
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:48,380
day, still no cheese. No, no, no, no. Cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese. Okay, cheese, cheese, cheese. Boom.

780
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:53,020
Cheese is in the cart. Cheese, cheese is in the front door. Freeze, cheese is in the front door.

781
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:56,700
Oh my God, what are you talking about? I have no idea. Customer Greg, I have absolutely no idea what

782
01:21:56,700 --> 01:22:01,740
you're talking about, my good sir. Look at that. You even have two shelves of cheese. Your claims

783
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:08,060
of not having cheese, unfounded customer Greg. How dare you? Completely unfounded. I have absolutely

784
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:14,700
no, your accusations against my store. I ask you instantly to remove your one-star review and a

785
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:22,300
trip advisor to my freaking supermarket. It is unfounded and it is damaging the sales

786
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:26,940
and my profit margins. Change, no change, exact change. Thank you, good sir. Couldn't find the

787
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:31,020
cereal. Yeah, you're right. You can't find the cereal. You want to know why? Because there's

788
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:35,900
none in stock. Boom. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? I don't know what you

789
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:41,980
mean. Thank you, customer Greg. And thank you Anonymous for all the tips. You guys are playing

790
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:49,020
with fire because the efficiency of the gameplay is about to severely go down if you keep this up.

791
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:54,780
Okay, card. Yes, $19. Thank you, good sir. All yours. Oh, thank you for your costume. No,

792
01:22:54,780 --> 01:23:00,620
appreciate it. Your change. $50, $20. Go. Thank you. Thank you. No, thank you. Cheese. Yes,

793
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:05,020
cheese. Take the cheese. There's customer Greg right there in the making. There he is. He's

794
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:09,900
picking up some products. Oh, there you go. There's your cheese. Yep. Thank you. Please remove

795
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:15,420
that terrible review you left on the supermarket. Would appreciate it. I'm going to start slacking

796
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:20,940
off at work. Slacking off. Oh my God, that should be the name of the title. Slacking off with your

797
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:31,900
co-worker at work. Oh my God. I love it. Don't worry about being late, you goofy goober. You have

798
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:37,340
a sheebie ace of art to look forward to. Be kind, reeflings. Over exposure to work times,

799
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:43,420
mud can lead to premature ink ejaculation. It's a serious issue and affects one in every five

800
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:48,540
cephalopods. Are you squiddin' Maria? It's okay, my little cephalopods, I believe you. I can imagine

801
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:54,940
Strani as a puppy girl. I mean she has the tongue belicking, of course. And she did tell us yesterday

802
01:23:54,940 --> 01:24:00,380
that her cervix is good for doggy. Stop! If you don't use juice, cetentical bone, you are gonna

803
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:07,100
have to bake like a good puppy. Are you squiddin' me right now? Stop! Strani, you are a good girl.

804
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:12,540
Stop! But don't worry, even if you misbehave, we'll still take you on walkies. You'll just have

805
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:17,500
to be muzzled, blindfolded, and have an egg vibing in the clam for correction purposes.

806
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:24,700
I am interested. You can't be saying the stuff in my head, peas. We're getting explicit 50

807
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:35,820
nine. I can't focus on the numbers, Mason! Me next. Thank you anonymous and reluctantly seen.

808
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:42,140
Stop it! You're making me embarrased. God, you guys are really having... Why is it only women

809
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:47,660
have problem with the shelf? I'm starting to think something's going on here. What are the odds that

810
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:53,420
both women are known for window shopping and they can't decide on what product to buy at the stage?

811
01:24:55,340 --> 01:25:02,780
Stop. How is this on YouTube? Why? We're in a supermarket. What are you all about?

812
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:08,140
We're in a supermarket. Excuse me, miss, you seem to have a wet patch. It is in aisle one,

813
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:17,340
it had an odd taste to it, and also it smells like clowns. No! Strani, I think we need to get a

814
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:25,180
clicker to help you stay motivated while working and be a good girl. No! Stop it! Thank you,

815
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:31,260
anonymous and rent desolation. Stop! Right, I didn't focus. You're getting redirected into

816
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:37,100
Sheebie's ASMR anyway, so she gonna keep you going. Right, I'm sorry but what is going on here?

817
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:46,220
Seriously, three of you make up your mind. Your husbands are at home wondering where you are

818
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:49,740
and you're just going nuts over the oil. There must be something wrong with the shelf.

819
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:58,780
I don't know. Can I push it forward? Carry? Okay. I'm just gonna move it forward.

820
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:08,140
No, it didn't make them adjust. Huh. What? What's wrong with the pathing? I don't see it.

821
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:17,740
It must be the product then. Hmm. User confusing me, ladies. I don't know what's the matter.

822
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:23,740
I'm afraid I don't know what the matter is. Right, I'm gonna try and sell out of my product to buy

823
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:32,220
the next upgrade to expand the shop. They're bugging. Yeah. They're bugging? I don't know what's going

824
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:47,660
on with them. Oh crap, we have bills to pay. Oh, come on. We're like all the way down again.

825
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:53,420
This game is actually hard. Sorry, I said it. Last time you bought Flour, it fixed.

826
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:58,540
Are they wanting Flour? Is that why everyone's having a hard time? I'm gonna try and sell out

827
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:03,820
my product so I can expand the store. If everyone buys everything that I've got right now, then boom,

828
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:11,500
we can do the next objective. We will never make money at this rate. Typical Scottish corner

829
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:16,940
shop, actually, though. Our money. That game literally made the game wants us to take along

830
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:24,540
because we don't do that here. No, we don't borrow from the banks. We blow them up. Stop.

831
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:30,940
Refling. You can't say that out loud. But you were thinking it. All right, hydration check,

832
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:32,380
refling. You need hydrate.

833
01:27:37,180 --> 01:27:41,740
Honestly, the begging girlfriend ASMR made you laugh your ass off. I'm glad you enjoyed it.

834
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:46,380
It was so fun to come up with. I came up with everyone's meme ASMR ideas,

835
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:51,580
but I didn't want to risk anyone's channel. I came up with that idea myself and I was like,

836
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:59,180
okay, I'll risk my channel by saying something silly like that. It popped off. It might hit 100K,

837
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:05,660
which is insane. It's insane to say your first uploaded ASMR video might get 100K views.

838
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:13,980
That's insane. I actually think we're gonna be... Oh, thank you for all your...

839
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:18,380
Your... Yes, thank you, custom. Thank you. Love you.

840
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:23,260
The gamble has played off, honestly.

841
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:30,300
You did this to yourself, Strone. I remember you once challenging reflings that if they wanted

842
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:36,300
to dominate you, they'd have to do a lot better. Now we have finally found your weakness, Puppy

843
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:37,740
No!

844
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:46,540
No, no, no, no. I literally just got tingles. Like, my body literally reacted to that. What the

845
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:52,940
fuck? No! Thank you, anonymous, but no! Stop. I'm trying to freaking run a supermarket.

846
01:28:53,660 --> 01:29:02,700
Le supermarché. J'ai travaillé. Le supermarché, mes yeux. Non joué dans la

847
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:08,700
travailler. I'm fucking trying so hard to say stuff in French. Bro, right, relax. I don't

848
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:17,740
know what's going on. We're gonna need to move it. Can you guys let me put it down before you

849
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:27,500
come over and glitch out again? How do I take the stuff off the shelf? It's messing up my game.

850
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:34,220
How do I take the stuff off the shelf? Okay, you know how I said the game's polished? I take

851
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:45,900
it back. I take it back. The game's not polished. The women are stuck again. I'm trying. I'm trying.

852
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:54,860
I'm trying. I think the game needs a little bit more work, but overall, we're getting there.

853
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:59,100
There's definitely something glitched out on that shelf. I'm gonna see if I can take the

854
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:04,700
stuff off it, like the products off of it, maybe. I don't really know what the issue is.

855
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:12,700
$24! All yours, sir. Thank you. We need $350 before the end of the day. And because you

856
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:16,700
are all being assigned here, I think we're getting less customers as well,

857
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:20,780
because the game can't assign too many customers at work. She's hypnotizing that.

858
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:24,620
They're baffled by the low prices. They can't comprehend.

859
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:33,580
I think you need an empty box to remove stuff. Right, okay, let's grab a box. We'll just buy

860
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:45,420
whatever. It's on cheap. Right, bread. Let's go. Purchase. Let's go. And then... No! Just wait a second,

861
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:54,380
please. Close through, drop, take. Are you squiddin' me right now? The box doesn't match the size,

862
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:58,300
are you jokin'? I bet you all it would take is a surprise slap to her arse or an extreme shock

863
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:03,260
to her collar. And she would be whimpering and panting and drooling at the mouth for her eflings.

864
01:31:03,740 --> 01:31:07,980
I must have them hypno eyes rolling in the back of your head ahead of our style.

865
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,380
What am I even s-

866
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:19,180
What do I even see?

867
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:30,540
What was I supposed to see? Thank you, Rufeland, for the tips.

868
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:39,580
And on to the mid-today, clearly. I thought I'm the one that's supposed to be coming up with

869
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:47,500
the scenarios, not you. Right, oil. Buy it and then get fricking rid of it off the dang shelves.

870
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:53,340
Okay, yes, yes, yes, thank you. Thank you, Ruf. So got another week.

871
01:31:54,700 --> 01:32:00,460
Man, I'm sick of this TTS spam. I want to watch a Stranny Cutler stream, not Brian's, each.

872
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:04,940
Are you had enough of Brian? Brian! Right, Brian, that's enough out of you, young man. Do you-

873
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:10,940
Did I make myself clear? Brian, no more. Okay. All right, as Brian dealt with, don't worry,

874
01:32:10,940 --> 01:32:17,820
I got you, Rufeland. Right, you, all. How do I put it in? Take. See you all glitching out.

875
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:22,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And they all- Right, I'm leaving this

876
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:27,420
box here in case it's glitchy, because what the heck was all that about, honestly? Oh, it's getting

877
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:34,860
dark in the shop. Ah, it's getting dark. I'm scared of the dark unironically. Are you squidding me

878
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:45,660
right now? This place is too small and crowded. Two stars. Are you helping me? Are you- Wait,

879
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:51,500
are you helping me gameplay-wise via role-playing as a customer?

880
01:32:52,460 --> 01:33:01,820
Are you helping me gameplay-wise role-playing as a customer? I think you are, because we do need

881
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:16,220
to expand. We just need the 350. Thank you, customer Greg's- Wait, what? There's no way.

882
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:26,700
There's actually no way. I'm $1 short from expanding. This is meta. This is why I like

883
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:35,260
backseat gaming. That is so creative. That is so creative. I can even do that myself. Oh my gosh,

884
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:42,780
right. Management, growth, section two. Purchase this section to expand. There we go, we did it.

885
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:51,500
Oh my gosh, that is hilarious. Thank you, customer Greg's fucking way to dollars change,

886
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:55,020
ma'am. Thank you. Couldn't find- No, you're not going to find nothing in this shop.

887
01:33:56,620 --> 01:34:08,220
Look at it. Oh my god, our scene got upgraded. It's getting so big. Yay. Okay, I need to push

888
01:34:08,220 --> 01:34:15,100
the products back on the shelf. This is not backseat and you are in a video game. No, because

889
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:19,420
some features don't like it when you tell them what to do and I'm like, please help me so much.

890
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:25,100
Thank you again for the tip. That was so creative. Customer Greg's wave, that's hilarious.

891
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:32,700
Honestly, hilarious. Right, we're going to push some stuff back. We need to- I wonder if you can

892
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:41,340
buy the supermarket radio. Right, all the frozen products are going to go along this- well,

893
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:45,500
or cold products, I guess. I'm going to keep the boxes in case something glitches out again,

894
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:51,980
because that was a bit of a nightmare to fix. Nice, it's not an average customer shop anymore.

895
01:34:51,980 --> 01:35:00,140
It's not. Look how big the windows are as well. We are up. We- oh my god, sorry. Can I just say

896
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:04,060
the serotonin boost of like physically seeing your shop getting bigger because all of your

897
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:12,140
hard work paid off? I love these kind of games. Oh my god. I love these kind of games. I said it.

898
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:15,580
I said it. I'm sorry. I don't care. I said it. Right, what's the next objective? Oh, we haven't

899
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:19,580
been assigned one. Right, what are the bills? I'll pay the seven dollars. I can't pay rent.

900
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:26,140
Stronny be a good girl. Roll onto your back and I will give you a some tummy rubs. Then if you

901
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:32,940
keep being good, maybe I will give you this bone. No! You called yourself Stronny's trainer!

902
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:42,860
Reef- wait, we only have oil. Reef-ling! You can't- oh, maybe that could be a nickname for you guys.

903
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:45,100
You can be my personal trainer.

904
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:58,300
Could we get away with that? Could we? Should we? I don't know. Right, if I bought one of everything,

905
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:05,180
how much is that? Are you squidy? We can do 200 bucks. Remember, Stronny, if you want something,

906
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:10,380
you are going to have to bark for it. A good girl likes you knows that you can't speak English.

907
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:16,700
Years are done. Years are done. No more. Anonymous. Thank you. Me no, thank you.

908
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:22,220
Hey, I'm far in the back of this seat. Maybe keep a box for each product in the

909
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:29,500
storage for any more glitch shelves? Good girl. Okay. What is this? Is this a break room?

910
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:34,860
Are you squidin' me right now? Is this a break room? I got a bowl with her name on it so she can

911
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:42,860
shlop. Shlop oman na ala corn on the cup. This should give me hate. I only have oil to sell.

912
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:50,380
This is literally an American supermarket now. America kanya! TTS was a mistake. Stop! Thank you,

913
01:36:50,380 --> 01:37:01,420
Tharia. IBW. Anonymous. Are you squidin' me right now? Knock, knock, mom, are you okay? Why are you

914
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:11,020
salivating in front of your monitor? This puppy salivating. Okay, everyone is buying oil.

915
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:16,700
Literally. Yeah, I know you can't find nothing. I ain't got no stock. Everyone please purchase the

916
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:25,180
oil at your next convenience, okay? Because we are running low on the market prices lower than

917
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:29,180
three bucks. Okay, hopefully it changes as well. Oh my god, I think we're gonna have to like...

918
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:37,580
Oh, there's a customer. You spawned out of nowhere. You were not even in my shop a moment ago.

919
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:44,060
Please. Okay, everyone. Okay, yes, just buy oil. Thank you. This is helping so much. I'm not even

920
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:49,100
kidding. Please continue to buy oil. Does someone say oil's American screeching?

921
01:37:56,140 --> 01:38:02,380
I have a really funny clip of Azura, actually. Thank you Momo for the tip as well. I have actually

922
01:38:02,380 --> 01:38:08,780
a really funny clip of Azura. I might send it to her and see if she will let me post it.

923
01:38:09,580 --> 01:38:17,020
It was us before we did the group collab on debut. She randomly starts singing the American

924
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:21,660
national anthem, but Azura's got some lungs on her. She's like,

925
01:38:24,620 --> 01:38:28,220
and I'm like in the background. I'm like, make check, make check, and she's like,

926
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:36,300
I'm like, Amy, Amy, make check, make check, just so we can hear you. It was really funny,

927
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:40,940
so I'm gonna see if she's happy with me post it because it was hilarious. I'm like being super

928
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:45,340
serious. Like, oh, that was good guys, right? Make check, mercy, make check, check, check,

929
01:38:45,340 --> 01:38:54,620
and then buy the drones early night. It was absolutely hilarious. So, okay, I'm gonna have to

930
01:38:54,620 --> 01:39:02,220
buy some product. That isn't like a squadillion dollars because, right, 64 bucks. Yeah, just,

931
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:07,740
yeah, one oil. Yep. I know you can't find anything, sir. You're gonna, you'll never guess why because

932
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:15,020
we don't have anything in stock. I'm working on it. I'm working on it. We need an American flag

933
01:39:15,020 --> 01:39:25,660
bikini cookout, Azura. I think that is a fantastic alternative outfit for Azura. I actually fully

934
01:39:25,660 --> 01:39:30,300
agree with that. I'm not even kidding. I actually fully agree. I want to see those bedonkers bedonking

935
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:34,540
in an American bikini outfit. I'll take it. You can sing pretty damn well too though.

936
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:40,940
Well, I got Emmy, we finally got Emmy's song cover, which I've not paid the guy for yet.

937
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:43,740
Actually, sorry, if you're watching right now, I will pay you after the stream,

938
01:39:44,620 --> 01:39:48,220
and I just need some time to nap after the stream, and then I will deal with the rest.

939
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:56,540
Gonna grill them dogs, honestly though. Are you squidding me right now?

940
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:03,340
Just thinking about how a strong themed Tenga would go hard, and so would I.

941
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:10,060
What's a Tenga? Oh, that's the wrong number. Thank you, Tharia, for the tip, or the super

942
01:40:10,060 --> 01:40:14,380
trot. I don't know if I have to say super trot tip. I don't know. It's the same thing. What's a Tenga?

943
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:19,980
It sounds like a Konga. Konga, Konga, Konga, Konga. Tenga, Tenga, Tenga.

944
01:40:23,420 --> 01:40:26,940
Tenga is an honor hall. Oh, I've been singing about it.

945
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:32,140
I've been singing about it.

946
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:50,140
Okay, then. That's what it's called. I've never heard that terminology.

947
01:40:50,860 --> 01:40:56,620
Oh, you've just absolutely messed me up. Give me that back, and then put it down there.

948
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:06,700
She's a degeneracy built into her blood. No, why did I buy more oil? We have more than enough oil.

949
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:11,100
I'm gonna have to hire a reflin to go on the checkout, because this is getting tricky.

950
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:15,580
This is getting tricky. Insufficient change. Oh, what?

951
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:22,940
Giving six bucks. Okay, make it four, and then do 120, then one. Jeez.

952
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:30,460
Sorry, sir. I can't count, but thank you for giving me the patience to count. Kind of blue.

953
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:36,620
Come on, I need to restock here. Stop buying stuff. Give me a freaking moment to breathe. No

954
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:43,980
change. Thank you. Change two dollars. Thank you. Please, I need to like quickly buy stuff like

955
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:51,340
right now, because everything is so empty. I'm literally just buying anything.

956
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:56,220
Please. I don't know. Bread? I've not had bread in a while. Go. Boom. We love bread.

957
01:41:56,220 --> 01:42:03,020
Shadow Wizard Money Gang. We love bread around these parts. She's an oil. Change. Oh my God.

958
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:08,140
Sorry. I love this game. I'm addicted. I'm not gonna lie. I think I could easily play 12 hours of

959
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:10,780
this. I'm not sure anyone wants to actually sit and watch 12 hours of this.

960
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:19,580
I didn't take this phone like the good girl you are. Reflex where I played Supermarket Simulator.

961
01:42:21,980 --> 01:42:27,020
I didn't know the flubber aisle really got you going. Hey, Stronny, if you are a puppy girl,

962
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:35,820
what breed would you want to be? I haven't thought that far ahead. I don't know.

963
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:44,460
I have black hair, so this is an interesting TTS room. Literally, I'm like, is the bakery aisle

964
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:50,860
really getting you going that good? I mean, shit. I'll take it. I'm glad that you guys are enjoying

965
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:57,980
it. Thank you so much. Stronny's trainer and anonymous. I am working on the stock issues,

966
01:42:57,980 --> 01:43:03,100
man. Please have patience for the love of God. I just get paid minimum wage. I just show up and

967
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:13,020
I'm trying. I'm actually getting stressed by my virtual job. I can't believe it. I can't handle

968
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:19,580
stress. Oh, God, the packages, please. Will someone please think of the packages? Milk is only two

969
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:28,220
dollars? What? I'm coming, please. Wait. I was gonna say three dollars seems a bit more,

970
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:34,780
a bit more economy related. Oh my God. I'm actually getting stressed. I can't keep up.

971
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:39,980
Actually, unironically, can't keep up. Oh my God. I need help. I need help. I need an adult.

972
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:46,620
I need an adult. Wait. I'm the adult. No. I don't have time for all of this. Right. We've got sugar

973
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:50,140
again. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. All right. All right. All

974
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:56,780
right. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I can do this. I can do this. Ninety. Why would you

975
01:43:56,780 --> 01:44:04,540
give me such big number of change? The milk is French. Wait, is it? Does it say delay on it?

976
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:13,580
Does the milk say delay? Milk semi-skilled. Boulay. What? It is French. Well, zero isn't French.

977
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:20,540
Okay. We're gonna unpack everything that we purchased. I have no idea what we purchased.

978
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:26,940
I was just busy panicking, but okay. Not to ruin it. Right. Close your ear canal if you don't want

979
01:44:26,940 --> 01:44:34,140
to hear a spoiler on what one of the zero shorts are. She played supermarket simulator and one of

980
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:39,500
the things she said was like, do you want my milk basically? Because she was selling milk product.

981
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:44,620
But it was like such a good clip and it's getting made and I'm so excited for it to come out.

982
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:50,460
A British woman selling French product. Disgusting, honestly. What will they think?

983
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:56,940
Is there a Boulay? No. Don't call her that. I'm just kidding me right now.

984
01:44:58,540 --> 01:45:03,260
If it starts raining, I think I know what to do with all that oils. Omega.

985
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:11,100
Wait, what does that mean? Azu Ryuji. Oh, come on. You need to make your names easier for me to say.

986
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:19,740
What is that? Azu Re Ya Uji. Thank you for, thank you for letting me take your cherry yonk.

987
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:25,340
My cherry now. What are you gonna do about it? Yonkers. My super chat cherry now.

988
01:45:25,660 --> 01:45:32,620
I'm fucking it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fond de la bosom. Well, you should have heard of one of

989
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:37,180
the names. Right, I can tell you later but I can't tell you right now. Cover myself in oil?

990
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:44,780
What? If it starts raining, I think I know what to do with all that oil. I'm to cover myself in oil?

991
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:56,780
Hard-ass names, honestly. Oil up. Stronnycuddles oiled up when? Right now. I technically already

992
01:45:56,780 --> 01:46:01,340
made that ASMR but I got taken down but I'm gonna put it back up on September because it wasn't

993
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:08,300
the clapping that got the video taken down. It was the breathing in the ear. Yes, that is true.

994
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:13,900
How much is cheese? Cheese is three bucks. How much is pasta? Pasta is three dollars.

995
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:20,380
How much is bread? Bread, I am overcharging for bread. Very big. Very big overcharge? No, I will

996
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:33,500
not say why. Right, tea. I made a good profit from, we've not got, I think we need another fridge.

997
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:42,540
You know that. Oh, there's a thing as a double fridge. Oh, I mean, where are the floors? Oh,

998
01:46:42,540 --> 01:46:47,020
we can change the floor? I mean, I'm not really fussed for changing the floor. I'm not sure that's

999
01:46:47,020 --> 01:46:52,860
gonna make a difference to sales, is it? Unless the carpet is like absolutely minging, I think we're

1000
01:46:52,860 --> 01:47:01,020
okay just to leave the carpet as it is. Right, pay my bills, pay my rent. I can't pay rent. Hiring,

1001
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:06,780
right, what's going cashier? One, automated checkout, daily wage, 80 bucks, hiring cost,

1002
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:16,780
100, complete checkout. What? Complete checkout, it requires store level 10. I can't hire you

1003
01:47:16,780 --> 01:47:26,140
refling until store level 10? It's an old troll science comic. Oil floats on water. So to fly,

1004
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:30,780
you cover yourself in oil, wait for it to rain, then you can fly for free.

1005
01:47:31,580 --> 01:47:36,700
What? How was I supposed to get that reference? Thank you, tiny spiny. There's no way. Hire a

1006
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:43,580
reef stalker. Oh, that's actually pretty good. I'll take that. Please understand that algorithm is

1007
01:47:43,580 --> 01:47:47,820
unfamiliar and uncomfortable with the concept of breathing. Literally, though. Pass the three

1008
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:55,100
bucks outrageous, honestly. How? Right, so I can't hire anyone yet. That's fine. Storage, I don't want

1009
01:47:56,300 --> 01:48:04,060
customization. Oh, I can change the name by cost, money. Change entrance. No, thank you. I'll take

1010
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:13,660
my tight clamp and elsewhere. Growth, right. Section three, four. So this is for the sigh. How much?

1011
01:48:14,620 --> 01:48:23,660
How can I make this much profit selling eggs? How big can this game get? Product license. Peanut

1012
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:33,660
butter, flour. Oh my, this game is like way bigger than I first imagined. Banknot, market,

1013
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:37,500
furniture, a new shelf maybe? How much is a shelf? 100 bucks?

1014
01:48:37,900 --> 01:48:44,060
Maybe a shelf for more, although the... Oh!

1015
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:54,700
A checkout. Right, a checkout means we can hire a reflin at level 10. Okay. Okay, let's just focus

1016
01:48:54,700 --> 01:49:01,660
on getting our money up. Okay, we can do that. Clamps to take, you need industrial pliers.

1017
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:07,260
Stronny, your bakery always gets me going. I will eat all of your cake. Once I am done,

1018
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:13,340
all that will be left is some cream. Are you... Are you fucking naming Stronny's cake on us, sir?

1019
01:49:13,340 --> 01:49:19,100
That's amazing. Thank you for the tip. The bakery, the bakery's not open. All we have is sugar. We

1020
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:24,380
don't even have flour. I'm out of flour already, literally. No, even started and I'm out of products.

1021
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:31,500
Where's flour? Go. Order. Oh no, there's something else in here. $60. Let's just get the

1022
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:37,820
flour in. Let's just get it in. Okay, a yolk now. Hee hee hee. Oh, I do have flour. Right,

1023
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:42,220
I'm just blind. I'm sorry I'm blind. Don't look at me. Don't look at me. Okay, I'm blind.

1024
01:49:43,580 --> 01:49:49,100
Grilla's out of cake. Stronny provides the egg for the bakery. Did you know you spawn in

1025
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:54,620
with like 10,000 eggs and literally only like 100 or viable or something silly like that?

1026
01:49:55,180 --> 01:50:01,100
There's like some, honestly, I could talk about like pregnancy and ovulation cycle and all that.

1027
01:50:01,100 --> 01:50:08,780
Speaking of ovulation, thank you very much for your custom goods, sir. Oh no, the conversation I'm

1028
01:50:08,780 --> 01:50:14,780
having in the headset, it's just with my co-workers. They're locked in the room right now in the staff

1029
01:50:14,780 --> 01:50:20,220
room. I just don't have access to my co-workers yet. It's fine. No, no, don't report me for the

1030
01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:24,700
conversations. I know you can't find the cereal. I can't afford the cereal. That's why you can't

1031
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:30,780
find it, sir. Okay, I can afford it this time. Okay, you just spend your time at the shelves

1032
01:50:30,780 --> 01:50:35,420
a lot, but no, no, no, don't go to the- thank you. They're so quick. Like, they honestly didn't

1033
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:38,860
give you like, I'm sorry, but you can actually see me restocking and trying to do all these

1034
01:50:38,860 --> 01:50:44,780
jobs at the same time. And they're like, servicing now, please. I don't know your marks. I'd be

1035
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:50,380
too shy to say anything though. I don't know if that's the component, but like, you have no filter,

1036
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:56,860
by the way. I know I'm aware. I'm sorry. I apologize. How do we restock your eggs? No, you

1037
01:50:56,940 --> 01:51:03,660
spawn in with them. You spawn in with all the eggs. You don't generate any new eggs at birth or

1038
01:51:03,660 --> 01:51:10,860
anything like that, like after birth or anything. You spawn in like that for genetic material. It's

1039
01:51:10,860 --> 01:51:14,860
actually really fascinating. I don't know. I don't know how you felt about the education stream

1040
01:51:14,860 --> 01:51:20,620
yesterday. I had a blast, okay? I'm gonna be honest. I had a blast. Sorry, I like education. I think

1041
01:51:20,620 --> 01:51:26,460
it's fun. And I didn't know if you guys knew I was gonna give you a little quiz at the end,

1042
01:51:26,460 --> 01:51:33,180
but I was like giggling away, kicking my feet under the table when I was making my wee thing up

1043
01:51:33,180 --> 01:51:37,900
for years. I was like, I'm gonna get him. This is how I'm gonna get him. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna

1044
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:42,540
do that. Are you squeezing me right now? And I'll do that. I bet Stronny would love a refling

1045
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:47,900
growling in her, like a predator ready to turn her into prey. Little pup will learn her place

1046
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:53,420
under her alpha refling. What? The list, how wet is the fabric of your chair from this teasing?

1047
01:51:53,420 --> 01:52:05,820
Stop! I'm in the supermarket! Les supermarchés! Arrête! Arrête! J'attends la fucking supermarché,

1048
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:12,940
man. Fucking hell, reflins. Why are we all, why are we so, what happened? What, is it filming?

1049
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:17,740
Why are we all so revved up? Give us a week. Give us a week. Give us a week, okay? A week and then

1050
01:52:17,740 --> 01:52:23,980
it all starts up again, okay? Because we, something's going on with us right now. It is a film.

1051
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:30,220
It's a full moon, clearly, because what's going on? No, I'm just purchasing stuff. Please,

1052
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:36,860
give me a sec. I swear the game makes them teleport as soon as you look away for a millisecond.

1053
01:52:36,860 --> 01:52:42,300
Out my way, ma'am. You're in my way. Right, coffee. Oh my god, that's so satisfying the way

1054
01:52:42,620 --> 01:52:48,540
they stalk. Oh, I just walked into them. Okay, small age happy break. If us

1055
01:52:48,540 --> 01:52:54,380
reflings were to work in your store, what type of uniform would we have? Just the hat or would

1056
01:52:54,380 --> 01:53:03,740
we have a little shirt as well? Would you have a shirt? I don't think I'm a uniform. That's a

1057
01:53:03,740 --> 01:53:11,340
good question. I need an easy access uniform. I said what I said. I don't care. I'm sorry. I said

1058
01:53:11,340 --> 01:53:16,700
what I said. I need an easy access. That's it. That is how I will deal with the nine to five.

1059
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:20,220
Most people need alcohol at the end of the day to deal with their nine to five.

1060
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:24,140
Some people need smoke cigarettes for the nicotine hit. Some people, you know,

1061
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:28,540
recreational drugs to deal with the nine to five at the end of the day. I just need easy access.

1062
01:53:28,540 --> 01:53:35,340
That's all I'm asking. Velcro? Velcro? That would be hilarious. I'm sorry. That's absolutely

1063
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:42,620
hilarious. Velcro all constantly like every 10 minutes, all you hear is and then in the break

1064
01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:53,020
room, just every two seconds. That's honestly hilarious. I let you weren't you were not even

1065
01:53:53,020 --> 01:53:58,060
approaching this till I swear you were not even approaching this. There's no way and it's getting

1066
01:53:58,300 --> 01:54:05,500
No, stop. I'm just turning the lights on, please. Turn the lights on. Why is there so many

1067
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:11,580
customers? Apologies, Mamalaz-Riflin saw a cute supermarket worker working the cash register

1068
01:54:11,580 --> 01:54:17,900
and we couldn't resist. See her blush. Stop. Okay, that was a compliment. So I'll take it.

1069
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:25,740
Why is there so many customers? What's going on? Don't you all have like wife and kids to go home to

1070
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:30,780
juice? What do you mean you're getting milk to go home? Thank you Anonymous for all the tips.

1071
01:54:30,780 --> 01:54:35,500
You're all called anonymous, but I don't want to grip you together. I will thank you individually.

1072
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:39,660
Thank you Anonymous. Thank you Anonymous. Thank you Anonymous. I'm under the counter.

1073
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:43,500
It's raining some strange liquid and I'm hearing some wild shite.

1074
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:53,900
You're not hearing anything. This place is empty. Needs more items. Three stars. Okay. Okay. Okay.

1075
01:54:53,900 --> 01:54:59,580
We're getting up. There we're getting up. Wait, wait, that's a new, you're making new

1076
01:54:59,580 --> 01:55:06,220
YouTube accounts because that's your first super chat registered on the account. There is no way

1077
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:14,460
you're going to all that effort. You're making new YouTube accounts to stream snipe in game.

1078
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:25,740
Thank you customer Gregson. Oh my God. That's amazing. Momo, thank you for the tip as well.

1079
01:55:25,740 --> 01:55:33,820
There's strange liquid stuff. Oh my God. How are you going to such efforts?

1080
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:40,220
Right. I'm just going to completely sell out a product. I know I should probably order before.

1081
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:46,940
Order. Have you guys been on TikTok to that Scottish Chinese shop? I'm so sorry to

1082
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:52,540
completely derail with brain rot. So on TikTok, there's this Chinese Scottish shop

1083
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:59,740
and she like packs the orders, but she's got a funny accent. So she goes, come pack this customer's

1084
01:55:59,740 --> 01:56:06,460
order with me. This family needs 100% discount and some special treatment.

1085
01:56:07,420 --> 01:56:14,220
Yeah. Oh, thank you. This family needs 100% discount honestly though. Order. Yes,

1086
01:56:14,220 --> 01:56:21,900
fucking sin sister knows what it is. It's Becca's takeaway. And she's like, come with me today to

1087
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:28,060
pack this customer's order, but it's like a vocal fry on order. So it's like order.

1088
01:56:29,660 --> 01:56:34,780
Because it's not really that common to have a vocal fry in Scotland. It's rather,

1089
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:40,460
it's very Americanized if you will. Oh my God. Don't talk about America Challenge failed yet

1090
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:45,420
again. Honestly, I can't believe it. Right. What have we got? I definitely need in a much bigger

1091
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:53,740
fridge. I'm needing a bigger refrigerator. Right. We are going to preemptively pay all of our rent

1092
01:56:53,740 --> 01:57:00,140
issues. I don't feel like I'm making any profit. Am I going crazy? But I feel like I'm like losing

1093
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:07,660
money somehow. Like I'm struggling to pay these bills. Me and Strone are going to do an

1094
01:57:07,660 --> 01:57:14,220
really Scottish tourist stream and we're going to go to a mukbang at Becca's. But I'm packing this

1095
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:19,900
order for two v-chippers. Would you guys still love me if I had a vocal fry?

1096
01:57:20,220 --> 01:57:28,380
Okay. Wait. How can I do a vocal fry on a Scottish accent? Order. Good afternoon, Henry

1097
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:39,500
Flings. I hope you're doing well. I could not maintain that. That's hideous. Right. Let's buy

1098
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:48,780
the big wall of ours. What have we got? $200? Oh, we're doing math with my order. Oh my God.

1099
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:52,940
That's awful. Please do not speak for the rest of the stream. I'm sorry. Thank you. Are you

1100
01:57:52,940 --> 01:58:00,460
squiddin' me right now? Wow. At this point, forget the ASMR booth. Just open a store staffed by

1101
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:06,300
Reeflings. Okay. You can stay in the break room and be in charge of Team morale. We may be hard,

1102
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:13,100
but you can take it. No need to be a good girl. You can be our bad girl. Wait, but would that

1103
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:17,660
actually boost morale? Like, unironically, you know how like businesses are all like, I'm trying to

1104
01:58:17,660 --> 01:58:25,100
boost the morale of the staff without increasing their wages or whatever. I'm like, I feel like

1105
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:30,140
that might work. You know, just me sitting in the staff room being like, how are the sales good?

1106
01:58:30,140 --> 01:58:37,580
And then pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. This is the most inappropriate conduct a store has ever.

1107
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:43,580
I think business would be booming though, you know? And like, as like, as a customer,

1108
01:58:43,580 --> 01:58:49,580
you come in and then like, all you hear is like muffled like, like behind the door is like,

1109
01:58:49,580 --> 01:58:53,500
is everything okay back there? It's just like, yeah, we're just expanding the shop. We're drilling.

1110
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:56,940
We need to drill holes in the walls. So that's what that noise is.

1111
01:58:58,700 --> 01:59:02,460
Thank you, Zarian, for the tip. I think I've seen that video on a certain way. So,

1112
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:10,140
Chinese, Scottish, YUMMY. I miss a Chinese. Right. I'm going to buy all the products tomorrow

1113
01:59:10,140 --> 01:59:14,700
and I'm going to go crazy and stack all the motherfucking jobs. Products found expensive,

1114
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:19,900
products not found. Right, relax. Right, we can't all fricking, right. I know the market price is

1115
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:28,460
changing. I'm sorry, but I ain't got time. Okay. Order. Oh, you can-

1116
01:59:34,700 --> 01:59:39,340
I mean, you're not wrong. You're not, I didn't realize you can run in this game.

1117
01:59:39,340 --> 01:59:44,300
Oh my gosh. How long have I been on this game for? And I didn't know you could fricking run.

1118
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:54,220
Look how fast I am. Are you serious? You can run in this game the whole time? I am so fast.

1119
01:59:57,900 --> 02:00:03,580
I am so fast. Is this a joke? Oh, I can't sell the egg. Sorry.

1120
02:00:04,060 --> 02:00:10,300
Right. I am so fricking fat. Oh my god. Wait, why did I buy so many fridge stuff? I don't have room

1121
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:20,540
in the fridge. Everyone watching the products expire. Oh my gosh. I didn't know you could move in this-

1122
02:00:20,540 --> 02:00:24,220
Oh, open, open. I was wondering why the customers aren't coming. Wait, how do I clean the outside

1123
02:00:24,220 --> 02:00:30,060
of the shop? It's dirty. Oh my god. This is not, this is not raising my beleveliness.

1124
02:00:30,060 --> 02:00:33,980
Oh, whatever that word is in Japan, beleveniminess. Oh, if we're going to say

1125
02:00:37,420 --> 02:00:41,980
belevenus, that's the word belevolne. What is that word?

1126
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:52,780
Your belevolence. Your belevolence? Benevolence. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Right.

1127
02:00:52,780 --> 02:00:59,260
Change 30 bucks. Go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm working on the oil. Okay. I'll order oil, jeez.

1128
02:01:00,620 --> 02:01:04,780
I'm trying. I'm trying. Okay. I have time. I have time because I can run.

1129
02:01:05,900 --> 02:01:10,940
Bruh. Why did I not figure out you could run? Can you crouch? No, you can't crouch. Are you

1130
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:14,220
squiddin' me right now? Okay, you can't crouch. It's fine. It's fine. No, don't bug out.

1131
02:01:17,820 --> 02:01:22,060
I feel out of place here as a sub. You're allowed to be a sub.

1132
02:01:23,340 --> 02:01:27,980
I'm pretty, I'm pretty alright. I mean, if you've listened to the new Patreon audio,

1133
02:01:27,980 --> 02:01:34,300
ain't no way you're a, you're a dumb in that audio. Look at the state of this place.

1134
02:01:34,300 --> 02:01:42,140
Riefland should be picking up the boxes. I'm going back to Tescos, honestly. Benevolence. Benevolence.

1135
02:01:42,140 --> 02:01:47,900
Okay, that sounds right. That sounds correct. I wish, I'm going to have to order, order

1136
02:01:48,860 --> 02:01:53,260
freakin' tea so I can put these away again. I don't know. There seems to be something about

1137
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:57,820
the bottom, like, left or, I don't know. Sliced bread is too expensive.

1138
02:01:59,900 --> 02:02:04,620
Okay, I agree with you. I'm sorry. I agree. I do agree. I agree. I agree. I'm sorry.

1139
02:02:05,740 --> 02:02:09,420
Look, the prices change every day. Isn't it funny how the prices change every day,

1140
02:02:09,420 --> 02:02:13,340
but they continue to go up and they never go down, even though there might be moments in time

1141
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:17,660
where things aren't as expensive as they should be. Isn't that curious? Curious, curious. Yeah,

1142
02:02:17,660 --> 02:02:23,100
that's what I think about you. Right, bread. We need more bread. Bread, bread, bread, bread.

1143
02:02:23,100 --> 02:02:28,380
Oh my God, fast. I'm fast as fuck, boy. Oh my God, sorry. This is so sad. It's fine to re-stock as

1144
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:36,700
well. I'm so fast. I'm so fast. Oh my God. Oh my God, I'm so fast. Sorry. This is the most

1145
02:02:36,700 --> 02:02:40,460
efficient shop. Sorry. Sorry. I need to unlock that break room, like, right now because the

1146
02:02:40,460 --> 02:02:44,620
reflins are waiting on my thoughts. Either the reflins are waiting on me or I'm waiting on them.

1147
02:02:44,620 --> 02:02:48,860
You know how it is around these parts, baby. Oh, I need the coffee box and tea box. Are you

1148
02:02:48,860 --> 02:02:54,300
squidding me right now? I need the tea. Give me the tea. No wonder Dad doesn't come here. There are

1149
02:02:54,300 --> 02:02:59,420
no items. No, no, there is. There is. I'm waiting for people to freaking buy this. Are you squidding

1150
02:02:59,420 --> 02:03:04,220
me right now? There's milk and water, but no one's buying. ASMR, Scottish Cuttlefish Attempts

1151
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:10,860
to Learn Her Second Language, English. Stop! It's true. It's actually true. No, it's true. It's

1152
02:03:10,860 --> 02:03:16,620
true. Thank you, tiny Spanish. That's actually so true. Customer Greg's daughter. I'm working on it,

1153
02:03:16,620 --> 02:03:21,820
daughter. I'm working. Customer Greg's daughter. I'm sorry. Forgive me. I need to fix the glitch

1154
02:03:21,820 --> 02:03:26,380
that's going on right now. I can't believe reflins are about to turn Strani into a free-use public

1155
02:03:26,700 --> 02:03:31,500
owner. Hold. I don't think we can say that. Can we say that out loud? I don't know.

1156
02:03:37,100 --> 02:03:41,740
Greg got a nuclear family. Literally, Greg is winning at life. Right, put all of this shit in

1157
02:03:41,740 --> 02:03:49,500
the box. Stop. Whatever it, stop. Literally, stop. Whatever you guys are doing, knock it off. I'm

1158
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:53,980
getting fed up. I'm getting, I'm not putting anything bottom right because it seems to be some sort of

1159
02:03:53,980 --> 02:03:58,220
weird glitch. $12. Thank you, ma'am. Are you squidding me right now? I apologize for my remarks.

1160
02:03:58,220 --> 02:04:04,940
I was getting frustrated that none of... Bark, bark. Growl. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1161
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:15,420
Now that add-on is being the Doug Customer Greg's daughter's dog. Are we role-playing as a

1162
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:20,140
meta role-play as I'm getting advice to play this game? This is, this is getting insane.

1163
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:26,700
It's just getting insane. This is amazing. Oh my god, look at the money rolling in now.

1164
02:04:28,300 --> 02:04:32,700
Oh, I need to hire, refland. I need to hire you so badly to get on the till. This is like,

1165
02:04:32,700 --> 02:04:39,100
it's never ending. It's never ending. There's so many of you. What's going on? Why? Because I fixed

1166
02:04:39,100 --> 02:04:46,140
the glitch, I think. Boom. Right, we've have $150. Can people start buying from the fridge?

1167
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:50,540
My products are going to go, they're going to spoil. I'm not even kidding. I need a new fridge.

1168
02:04:53,180 --> 02:04:57,100
It's better to buy the 375. I don't have 375 though.

1169
02:04:59,340 --> 02:05:02,460
Thank you, Anonymous. I can't believe reliefans are about to turn strong in there for you.

1170
02:05:02,460 --> 02:05:07,180
Ah, no, I'm not reading that out loud. Stop it, Anon. Bad Anon. Spank.

1171
02:05:09,100 --> 02:05:15,260
Tell me when Shibi goes live, by the way, just because she's doing ASMR today.

1172
02:05:15,260 --> 02:05:18,460
And Shibi is so close to 10k and I'm so excited. I'm about to...

1173
02:05:21,020 --> 02:05:26,140
I'm so excited for my genmei's success. Please give love and support to my genmeis.

1174
02:05:26,140 --> 02:05:29,420
I'm so proud of them and they're so hardworking and I love them and I'm going to kiss them on the

1175
02:05:29,420 --> 02:05:41,420
mouth. Anyway, that's just me. Shibi's live. Oh, I think her supermarket enterprises might be over

1176
02:05:41,420 --> 02:05:50,220
with. I don't know. I'm going to record that. My dad guessed in each of her names shortly.

1177
02:05:51,180 --> 02:05:55,260
Right, I'll play another day. I'm totally not addicted to this game, by the way.

1178
02:05:55,900 --> 02:06:00,300
But yes, my dad is going home in like a week's time, so I'm going to be depressed. But the

1179
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:05,980
good news is there's going to be tons of streams. But deep down, I'm going to be sad inside.

1180
02:06:06,940 --> 02:06:14,300
But you cheer me up. And I get to play loads of games with you again and I get to do all the

1181
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:19,580
ridiculous plans again. And I get to record all the ASMRs because I have tons of people waiting

1182
02:06:19,580 --> 02:06:26,540
on me to do collab ASMRs. So there's going to be content out there. But the only exchanges that

1183
02:06:26,540 --> 02:06:34,460
my dad has to go on. But that's okay because that's how life works sometimes. Okay, let's

1184
02:06:34,540 --> 02:06:42,540
very quickly buy new stock. Can I very quickly do this? Stock, you, you just shove everything in.

1185
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:45,820
Literally shove everything in. Are you squiddin' me right now? Please.

1186
02:06:55,820 --> 02:06:59,740
I think we're going to get in trouble. You guys are going to have to start substituting the way I

1187
02:06:59,740 --> 02:07:04,140
do. You guys are going to have to start substituting because I'm getting, stop buying milk! Oh my gosh,

1188
02:07:04,140 --> 02:07:09,340
stop buying milk. Stop buying refrigerated products. Please, I'm begging. Please, brain,

1189
02:07:09,340 --> 02:07:15,020
stop messing up so badly. Right, you. Right, you guys are going to need to start substituting

1190
02:07:15,020 --> 02:07:17,820
because I'm getting nervous for this board now. I'm getting nervous. I'm getting nervous,

1191
02:07:17,820 --> 02:07:20,860
but I'm glad you enjoyed the boot although. Because not everyone does it. Some people are like,

1192
02:07:20,860 --> 02:07:25,820
oh my god, I hate it. I hate it. It's like, bruh, bruh! Let's just role play. Close your eyes. It's

1193
02:07:25,820 --> 02:07:30,780
not real. Close your ears. Close your ears. You're subjecting yourself to something you don't like.

1194
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:37,500
Close your ears. Honestly, my dad literally listened to this conversation being like,

1195
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:43,500
what the fuck is going on in that room? What do you mean I have product? No! You're not supposed

1196
02:07:43,500 --> 02:07:47,900
to do that. I'm glad you went flower all yours. And you gave me a perfect change. Thank you, sir.

1197
02:07:47,900 --> 02:07:53,980
Have a good night. Have a good evening. I appreciate you. Can I please? Why are people not buying?

1198
02:07:55,100 --> 02:07:55,580
I mean.

1199
02:07:55,580 --> 02:08:00,780
Strongly, I will gift so many memberships if one day you can do an alternative outfit of you as

1200
02:08:00,780 --> 02:08:08,460
a puppy girl. I'm begging you. I don't, I mean, so my donathon is coming up. I've said like,

1201
02:08:08,460 --> 02:08:15,500
my donathons more like group activity stuff or like free access stuff. I've got about free use

1202
02:08:15,500 --> 02:08:23,180
on my mind now. Like, accessible stuff. You don't have to pay to access it. If you guys wanted to

1203
02:08:23,180 --> 02:08:28,140
like, I'm not going to stop you from like picking out because Azura is going to pick out what she

1204
02:08:28,140 --> 02:08:31,740
wants to do for her donathon. I assume she's going to do the same thing she needs next after.

1205
02:08:38,060 --> 02:08:45,420
Strongly cut us oiled up in 4K is currently the search suggestion. Thank you so much for letting

1206
02:08:45,420 --> 02:08:49,500
me yank your boy chair. Wait, what? Did I not yank your boy chair like two minutes ago?

1207
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:55,340
We are good fish, believe us, maybe. We are good fish. We're the goodest fish in all the land.

1208
02:08:55,340 --> 02:09:02,300
We just mind yourself swimming and stuff. Yeah, if you guys want to, as if I'm going to say no

1209
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:07,500
to a fucking alt puppy outfit, if you guys want to, you know, you know, hit me up, dab me up.

1210
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:14,380
Are you joking? I'll be a puppy VTuber. Are you joking? Like, literally, I will get the custom

1211
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:19,180
collar and it literally says property of reefling and then I'll get a toggle and everything and

1212
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:23,020
please don't think I'm not going to do that because I'm a laundry serious. Right.

1213
02:09:25,260 --> 02:09:30,860
Okay, let's do this and then pop that down and then let's sell these eggs because they are

1214
02:09:30,860 --> 02:09:39,820
literally rotting. Are you squidding me right now? Oh, eggs are only one. Free you zone a hole? No,

1215
02:09:39,820 --> 02:09:43,740
she's still in charge, but I'm about to make her into a Twinkie.

1216
02:09:44,860 --> 02:09:48,540
Reeflings, right, we're about to get in trouble. We're about, we're unironically about to get

1217
02:09:48,540 --> 02:09:53,740
in trouble. Stop it. I'm going to have to spank you, okay? You've been naughty right now. Oh,

1218
02:09:53,740 --> 02:09:57,900
hold on, hold on, right, put the cheese in, right, the cheese has probably expired like half a century

1219
02:09:57,900 --> 02:10:03,340
ago, but hey ho, and that's not going to stop us. Came back just in time for the pet play,

1220
02:10:03,340 --> 02:10:07,420
rip Vod. Honestly, I'm starting to get, I'm getting nervous for the Vod. If we can all

1221
02:10:07,900 --> 02:10:16,380
take a deep breath and get ready to be redirected into Sheebie's lovely.

1222
02:10:16,380 --> 02:10:24,380
Four dollars for eggs? Sheesh, don't mind if I do. I mean, honestly, this isn't that badly

1223
02:10:24,380 --> 02:10:28,860
stopped in all consideration. Right, we'll play one more day and then we're redirected into Sheebie.

1224
02:10:28,860 --> 02:10:36,460
No, I'm not addicted. Are you squidding me right now? Hey, are you guys hiring? I have no experience.

1225
02:10:36,460 --> 02:10:41,740
Unemployed Greg's grandson. Look, you have to start somewhere with experience. Don't you love it when

1226
02:10:42,460 --> 02:10:46,860
places require you to have experience, but they won't hire people who've never had experience

1227
02:10:46,860 --> 02:10:53,660
before? Isn't that a fascinating point of them being in a part of this society? Hmm, isn't that

1228
02:10:53,660 --> 02:10:58,380
curious that they make it really impossible for you to even get an entry level job without having

1229
02:10:58,380 --> 02:11:03,020
a freaking PhD in fucking Yunnan? Honestly, it's getting outrageous. Don't you just love that

1230
02:11:03,020 --> 02:11:09,420
part of society in the community at large? Don't you just fucking love it? Literally,

1231
02:11:09,420 --> 02:11:13,340
don't you love it? This is getting a bit too real, honestly. Are you squidding me right now?

1232
02:11:14,940 --> 02:11:19,740
Might be the cutest Twinkie I've ever seen. You think I'm a cute Twinkie?

1233
02:11:21,980 --> 02:11:27,180
Thank you as a Rijie for letting me pop your cherry again. I don't know why YouTube said

1234
02:11:27,180 --> 02:11:32,540
let me do it twice, but it did. Anonymous. Bit of strong eats. Oh, not whole. Oh my god. I think

1235
02:11:32,540 --> 02:11:40,220
I missed that. Oh, I didn't realize you called yourself that. Thank you, Momo. Thank you, Zion.

1236
02:11:40,220 --> 02:11:46,060
Thank you, unemployed Greg's grandson and Momo again. Literally five years experience for an

1237
02:11:46,060 --> 02:11:50,220
entry level job, like fucking calm down. Honestly, I could absolutely kick. I was going to say the

1238
02:11:50,220 --> 02:11:56,940
C word, but you're not allowed to say the C word. Graduate with a bachelor's degree, and I can't

1239
02:11:56,940 --> 02:12:02,860
even get an entry level retail job. Honestly, ma'am, why are you giving me that much change?

1240
02:12:02,860 --> 02:12:07,980
Don't do that again. That made myself clear. Don't do that again. Four bucks change. Let me think.

1241
02:12:07,980 --> 02:12:14,140
All yours. I'll always just go for the dollar bill. Searching for 10 years experience in a 25-year-old

1242
02:12:14,140 --> 02:12:19,980
is a while. Are you squidding me right now? It is. That didn't answer my question. Yes, I will hire

1243
02:12:19,980 --> 02:12:23,420
if you don't have experience because I'll teach you everything I can teach you.

1244
02:12:23,740 --> 02:12:31,740
Okay, now that's a tall order. Thank you for your custom search. This is our biggest order.

1245
02:12:31,740 --> 02:12:40,860
$29 reduced. Thank you. Thank you for your custom. That's our biggest sale yet. I can't believe it.

1246
02:12:40,860 --> 02:12:47,260
I can't believe having an array of products leads to people purchasing it multiple versions of it.

1247
02:12:47,260 --> 02:12:51,500
Shocking behavior. Honestly, shocking. Absolutely shocking. Good girl, strongy. I knew you could

1248
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:58,220
be a good if you tried. Keep this up and I will give you a treat later. Okay, that's acceptable

1249
02:12:58,220 --> 02:13:03,660
because that's implications, but it's not going to get as bad. Yes, I will hire, I will teach you

1250
02:13:03,660 --> 02:13:10,860
everything I know, and then you can be, and I'll vouch for your CV. I saw, oh my god, I should get a

1251
02:13:10,860 --> 02:13:15,820
throwaway number that you guys can use for a CV, and then they'll phone up and they'll be like,

1252
02:13:15,820 --> 02:13:21,180
hey, Anon says that you worked, they worked for you for like a year. Can you tell us about their

1253
02:13:21,180 --> 02:13:24,780
experience and all that, and I'll just like straight up like guess you up. I'll be like,

1254
02:13:24,780 --> 02:13:30,060
yeah, he was absolutely fantastic. I cannot recommend the employee. I was really sad to see him go,

1255
02:13:30,060 --> 02:13:35,900
but unfortunately, because I, you know, I had a few complications with my health, I could no

1256
02:13:35,900 --> 02:13:41,900
longer employ him, but Anon's perfect 10 out of 10. I so want to do that. That'd be the funniest

1257
02:13:42,700 --> 02:13:47,740
thing ever. Like I'll give you an email. I wonder why Grandpa hates this place. No, Grandpa likes

1258
02:13:47,740 --> 02:13:52,940
it. Look, I've got tons of products. Like come on. So I actually, this, I'm doing really well,

1259
02:13:52,940 --> 02:13:58,140
so I'm actually doing so well. So I don't believe you. I don't believe you first, I think. I definitely

1260
02:13:58,140 --> 02:14:04,060
need like a double fridge though. This is getting like outrageously. Oh, I'm about to be able to afford

1261
02:14:04,060 --> 02:14:11,020
a double fridge. Don't mind if I do. Any references? Yeah, I'm the reference. She's such a sweetheart.

1262
02:14:11,100 --> 02:14:14,860
I'll get you guys on a job somewhere. I know exactly what they want to hear because,

1263
02:14:14,860 --> 02:14:20,380
you know, if you didn't know. Well, now you know, hydration check, refling.

1264
02:14:25,340 --> 02:14:29,500
I'm waiting for my application to be approved. I need to be level 10 before I can hire a

1265
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:36,780
refling, unfortunately, Greg. Grigory. I wish I wasn't so scared. I would love to play Fanaf,

1266
02:14:36,780 --> 02:14:40,620
but I get very scared. I literally have a heart attack at the concept of the game.

1267
02:14:40,620 --> 02:14:49,100
So we shan't be playing Fanaf. But we can definitely watch the Fanaf movie.

1268
02:14:50,540 --> 02:14:58,060
Hear me out. Fanaf movie and a karaoke thing. Watch along. And we'll watch. I'll tell you what,

1269
02:14:58,060 --> 02:15:03,660
I'll get Emmy to play Fanaf, right? And then I'll watch her play it. And then we'll do the

1270
02:15:03,660 --> 02:15:08,220
Fanaf movie and then we'll do Fanaf karaoke. How about that? So I don't have to play it. I don't

1271
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:16,860
have to be. It's just we shit in my panty loons. You know what I'm saying? Change 44. Oh my God,

1272
02:15:16,860 --> 02:15:22,060
I'm so smart. What? Oh, wow. Sorry. Business is actually booming. What do you mean a fully

1273
02:15:22,060 --> 02:15:28,220
stocked shop equals business booming? Because I can, I literally am so busy now.

1274
02:15:28,940 --> 02:15:34,700
Oh, are you squidding me right now? Are we flings? No, you spelled it wrong!

1275
02:15:34,700 --> 02:15:36,380
My flings, I missed hearing that.

1276
02:15:36,380 --> 02:15:41,340
Violetton, Violetton, the other spelling. We're under the water, Violetton. Violetton,

1277
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:47,180
the other spelling, the other spelling, the other spelling. Honestly, it's genuinely not

1278
02:15:47,180 --> 02:15:51,340
a big deal. I literally paid for your concept and created you type thing. Nothing was a sign.

1279
02:15:51,340 --> 02:15:57,420
So literally saw his butt. But we spell it ee, r-e-e-fling. Thank you so much,

1280
02:15:57,420 --> 02:16:03,820
Violetton, for the 20. And it's nice to see you again. Nice to see you. Nice. Any old

1281
02:16:03,820 --> 02:16:08,860
refling, any new refling. Don't worry, you're all equally getting shagged. Shut the fuck up!

1282
02:16:09,420 --> 02:16:14,620
Sorry, I'm hyper. I'm really enjoying this game right now. I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.

1283
02:16:15,420 --> 02:16:22,540
I'm sorry. I'm enjoying this game thoroughly. It's the game. It's, it's the game. Okay, I'm so sorry.

1284
02:16:24,300 --> 02:16:29,500
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Right, we're gonna order,

1285
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:36,700
I dare, the double fridge, and then we're gonna order some product. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm so sorry.

1286
02:16:37,340 --> 02:16:43,820
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Right, hold on, how do I do that?

1287
02:16:45,100 --> 02:16:50,780
Are you squidding me right now? You are? Yeah. Reflings are down bad. Uh-huh. Sorry,

1288
02:16:50,780 --> 02:16:55,820
Strani, we've been very bad boys. You have, yeah. Whatever could we do to make up for it,

1289
02:16:55,820 --> 02:16:58,620
underscore sweat, and then you just said that.

1290
02:16:59,500 --> 02:17:05,820
Like, like chat reflects the streamer, okay, and streamer reflects the chat.

1291
02:17:07,020 --> 02:17:14,620
So maybe, sorry, and thank you. I am so sorry. That was wildly inappropriate.

1292
02:17:15,340 --> 02:17:19,500
Me, when the stream gets taken down, like, ah, okay. Are you squidding me right now?

1293
02:17:19,500 --> 02:17:24,060
Truly, wholeheartedly. I'm sorry too. Sorry that we aren't in the straight line right now.

1294
02:17:24,140 --> 02:17:28,460
Like, it's locked. I don't know how to get into it. I think if we expand the store and

1295
02:17:28,460 --> 02:17:31,180
off and let me do that, I'm gonna very quickly buy some more products.

1296
02:17:35,260 --> 02:17:41,020
I like to sing, I like to dance, but I can't do it with a pew pew in my pants. Got focused.

1297
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:47,180
Look, I'm working out, look, the reason why stock is low, you're gonna shit your pantyloons

1298
02:17:47,180 --> 02:17:52,940
when you realize stock is low because you guys are buying all the stock and I am a one-man army,

1299
02:17:52,940 --> 02:17:59,420
please. Lose, just buy the tea. Okay, he's actually buying like tons of tea though. Thank you.

1300
02:17:59,420 --> 02:18:08,060
Eggs and tea, that's what I like to sing. I'm down for apocalyptic. What? I'm down apocalyptic

1301
02:18:08,060 --> 02:18:16,140
for strong. What? Apocalyptic? What? Apocalyptic. Oh, apocalyptic is a word. Yes, it is a word,

1302
02:18:16,140 --> 02:18:20,300
actually. Now that you mentioned it, apocalyptic is a word. Okay, I'm done. I'm not speaking for

1303
02:18:20,300 --> 02:18:25,820
the rest of the stream. Whoa, I can't even speak English. Right, water. Pop it there.

1304
02:18:26,700 --> 02:18:35,020
Eggies. Pop it there. Okay. Whoa, I thought we were finished with customers. Jump scare,

1305
02:18:35,020 --> 02:18:42,220
honestly, geez. Down the apoliptical, honestly, isn't that a machine in a gym? The apoliptic is?

1306
02:18:43,180 --> 02:18:55,180
I cannot freaking speak right now. I'm starting and stammering. Someone clipped when I was very

1307
02:18:55,180 --> 02:19:04,220
kindly gifted like 10 memberships and I was like, I was just an absolute shambles. It was a shambles.

1308
02:19:04,220 --> 02:19:09,740
Right, let's clean this up. We've got a few, just a few deliveries, just a few deliveries. Right,

1309
02:19:09,740 --> 02:19:13,260
we'll clean all this up, we'll do one more date and then I'm redirecting into Sheebie and there's

1310
02:19:13,260 --> 02:19:19,260
nothing you can do about it. You're getting loved on by the bun. She got buns of steel, okay? You're

1311
02:19:19,260 --> 02:19:23,820
getting loved on by the bunny. She's an ASMR. Please subscribe. She's almost hit 10,000 subscribers,

1312
02:19:23,820 --> 02:19:30,860
which is freaking awesome. As I said, the girls are like, they're just so fantastic and they're so

1313
02:19:30,860 --> 02:19:35,420
excited to reach these milestones because it's like, that's right, Strani give up on speaking English

1314
02:19:35,420 --> 02:19:43,340
and just bark for us. Stop! Make sure you get a good reward. It's so anonymous. Stop.

1315
02:19:44,940 --> 02:19:52,620
I have another week to wait. I have a whole week. I can't do anything for a week. Knock it off.

1316
02:19:52,620 --> 02:19:59,340
I'll start barking orders at you. Thank you for the tip though. And Momo, thank you for the tip

1317
02:19:59,420 --> 02:20:06,940
with the pew pew. Any purers? Any self-identified purers? I pee. I pee my pants. Sorry. I don't know

1318
02:20:06,940 --> 02:20:14,060
why I always make that joke. I don't know. I find it funny. Yes, also Sheebie's dream. Well,

1319
02:20:14,060 --> 02:20:18,780
Sheebie said she wanted a play button. So I told all the girls I will do everything I possibly can

1320
02:20:18,780 --> 02:20:25,740
to achieve a play button for you goofy gibbers. So if you didn't know, I have fantastic news. If

1321
02:20:25,740 --> 02:20:34,540
you're a clipper, Veilure is coming out with a clipping program very soon TM. And the current,

1322
02:20:34,540 --> 02:20:39,980
now you do have to apply and be accepted for it. You can't just automatically get it overnight. But,

1323
02:20:40,620 --> 02:20:49,100
but for every 1000 views you get, we have, we are going to trial $2 per every 1000 views you get

1324
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:55,020
in the clipper program because we want to say a special thank you for taking the time to go

1325
02:20:55,020 --> 02:21:07,980
through VODs and edits. So we're going to offer $2 per 1000 views and the ceiling price is 100k.

1326
02:21:08,700 --> 02:21:15,340
So for one clip you could in theory get $200. However, it does have to have an expiry date

1327
02:21:15,340 --> 02:21:19,740
because we can't like pay you out like three years after, you know, the clips are, you know, the girls

1328
02:21:20,460 --> 02:21:26,060
are, you know, um, but if the clip gets over 100k views, but it reaches like a next milestone,

1329
02:21:26,060 --> 02:21:30,700
you also get like a bonus on top, but it's not 2000 per views. Like cause I didn't,

1330
02:21:30,700 --> 02:21:34,780
I didn't want to insult why am I standing here? Bro, it's the end of the day. Right. One more day.

1331
02:21:34,780 --> 02:21:38,700
Well, just give me one more day. Just give me one more day. What do I need? I need cereal.

1332
02:21:39,500 --> 02:21:47,260
I need a lot. Right. What do I need cereal? There's already flour. I need oil.

1333
02:21:48,220 --> 02:21:52,220
Water? Are you squidding me right now? More cheese. Why not? We'll buy all that in the month.

1334
02:21:52,220 --> 02:21:57,500
Screw the two dollars. For every 1000 views I want licking the ear from mama.

1335
02:21:57,500 --> 02:22:01,740
Oh, well, I've got that coming out. I need to edit it. It goes on Twitter for free. There's going

1336
02:22:01,740 --> 02:22:06,620
to be tons of ear licking content on Twitter because I recorded tons of fun ear licking and

1337
02:22:06,620 --> 02:22:14,940
then it never happened. Day 12, store income. Oh, yeah. Right. Uh, let's very quickly order this.

1338
02:22:15,020 --> 02:22:23,260
Order. Come on. Come on. Come on. I've never restocked harder in my life.

1339
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:27,420
Come on. Before the customers come in. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's do it. Let's do

1340
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:33,820
it. Let's do it. Oh, wait. We already have oil. Oh, I need cereal. Why did I buy that? I need

1341
02:22:33,820 --> 02:22:39,660
cereal. Cereal. Do we need bread? Be honest. Do we need bread? No, that's bread there.

1342
02:22:40,220 --> 02:22:46,940
More sugar. I mean, we can just buy whatever at this point then. Oh, open. Open. Quick. Quick.

1343
02:22:49,340 --> 02:22:50,300
Right. Let's buy more bread.

1344
02:22:52,460 --> 02:22:54,220
Oil. Hell yeah. Oil.

1345
02:22:56,380 --> 02:23:03,740
Like I always said, oil. Are you American? Thank you as Richie and Momo as well. There's

1346
02:23:03,740 --> 02:23:08,220
going to be tons that you're licking. I promise. Just let me cook in a week. Let me, there'll be

1347
02:23:08,220 --> 02:23:14,140
so much cooking in a week. You have no idea. Do you call fish? Do you call fish? Do you call

1348
02:23:14,140 --> 02:23:19,660
fish? Sorry. I got, I got effing on my mind because of that freaking storage room thingy.

1349
02:23:19,660 --> 02:23:27,260
Why are you paying so much? Go. At my face. Let her cook what's for dinner.

1350
02:23:30,220 --> 02:23:34,540
I'm a full fish. Wait, what was the statement? I forgot. Do you call fish even have a tongue

1351
02:23:34,540 --> 02:23:39,580
for licking? Eh, not really. It would really be all done by the tentacle of things. But I have

1352
02:23:39,580 --> 02:23:53,260
eight. What the shit? I showed my dad my mech assault stream and he said hi to you all

1353
02:23:53,260 --> 02:23:58,380
whilst we were watching the board. I was like, so those are the reeflands and they all say hi to

1354
02:23:58,380 --> 02:24:07,260
me and we're all having a giggle. He really liked the scene where I was panicking in the

1355
02:24:08,540 --> 02:24:13,420
mech assault map where it was like you pretend to be an enemy because you're going to soot

1356
02:24:13,420 --> 02:24:18,860
or basically. He was like laughing at that and he was like reading all your chat and he was like,

1357
02:24:19,500 --> 02:24:24,380
your chat, my chat. Sorry, I'm trying to do it from his perspective. He was reading it and he was

1358
02:24:24,380 --> 02:24:28,220
like, whoa, they're really interactive. And I'm like, yeah, like that's like the fun of streaming

1359
02:24:28,220 --> 02:24:32,140
is like you get to talk live. They get to read your comment because like I explain to him like

1360
02:24:32,140 --> 02:24:42,780
I got explained to him that I got explained to me that when the streamer reads out your comment,

1361
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:46,780
like it gives you a little serotonin boost. Like you ready? She AFK. She has brain rot. It's over.

1362
02:24:46,780 --> 02:24:50,540
Strong is going to be cooking so much so there's barely going to be any loudest fucking eagle sounds.

1363
02:24:50,540 --> 02:24:55,340
Give me fuel. Give me fire. Give me that witch I desire. Oh, hi pops and we cry when she disappears.

1364
02:24:55,340 --> 02:25:01,820
Hi papa. Oh yeah. What did you think of everyone wanting to marry? He finds it but he loves it.

1365
02:25:01,820 --> 02:25:10,700
He loves it. He has one question for you. Celtic arrangers. You have to pick. That's his question

1366
02:25:10,700 --> 02:25:21,580
for you. Basically. Basically. Yeah. Read mine too. Yeah. Yeah. Take that serotonin.

1367
02:25:22,140 --> 02:25:25,420
Take that serotonin boost. That's right. I'm reading what you're saying. What you can do about it.

1368
02:25:27,900 --> 02:25:31,820
What was the question? Maybe Celtic? Yes. Ah, yes. The ball. I love sports games.

1369
02:25:31,820 --> 02:25:37,580
Exactly. Celtic. Celtic. True. Read mine too. It's a super nice. True. Exactly. Get serotonin boost

1370
02:25:38,540 --> 02:25:42,940
Celtic. Exactly. That's right. Get that serotonin boost. The streamer has said

1371
02:25:42,940 --> 02:25:53,260
Lord give me one more chance. I love that song. It's so good. As if I can do any of that. Get

1373
02:25:59,100 --> 02:26:06,380
you didn't have any cheese. Also the eggs my friends son bought tasted to eggy. Some eggs tasted

1374
02:26:07,340 --> 02:26:12,460
to eggy. Karen your comments about my shop are unfounded and I do not appreciate them. Karen

1375

1377
02:26:33,100 --> 02:26:40,700
to build a casino. You want a casino? No. Gamble bad though. Gamble only good in Baltic. In Baltic

1378
02:26:40,700 --> 02:26:46,780
and Baltral. Why did I say Baltic? Baltic means cold in Scots. It's like oh that's Baltic. That's

1379
02:26:46,780 --> 02:26:54,860
reason. A casino. Oh come on. Come on. Come on. Give customer Greg's son-in-law a chance. Okay he's

1380
02:26:54,860 --> 02:27:00,620
allowed to. Well you never started on a word before or spelt something wrong. How dare you? How dare

1381
02:27:00,620 --> 02:27:05,420
you? You think you're so high and mighty the way you've never started in your life before. I'm

coming for you. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Get happy. Get happy. Get happy. Gamble is only good

1383
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:17,340

1384
02:27:17,340 --> 02:27:23,900
Is in the Balkans? No. Is that a Stonia flag? Am I going crazy? I'm sure that's a Stonia flag.

1385
02:27:24,700 --> 02:27:28,620
A Stonia I mentioned. I really hope you're coming for me.

1386
02:27:29,900 --> 02:27:35,020
You think I'm not? You think this is a joke huh? Strip poker. Well it's called sounds like a high

1387
02:27:35,020 --> 02:27:41,820
stakes game. What does that mean? Is that a pun or is that like a sentence? I'm so sorry. I don't

1388
02:27:41,820 --> 02:27:45,740
have my brain on me right now. What's wrong? Couldn't find the cheese. You just bought the cheese.

1389
02:27:45,740 --> 02:27:50,940
Am I going crazy? Rewind the void. Did she not just buy the last cheese and then complain that

1390
02:27:50,940 --> 02:27:59,500
she couldn't find the cheese? Uh, Madame, you are the problem. Right, I'm not going to restock

1391
02:27:59,500 --> 02:28:06,140
because we're going to redirect into Sheepsters doing her VA some more. And then I'm not going to

1392
02:28:06,140 --> 02:28:11,340
play this offline but please don't be surprised if I go nuts for another version of this, like

1393
02:28:11,340 --> 02:28:17,980
another stream of this game. I'm sorry but this gameplay, money go up and then I can unlock a

1394
02:28:17,980 --> 02:28:23,180
refling and I can like sexually harass you at the till and stuff. Like come on, come on. That's

1395
02:28:23,180 --> 02:28:30,220
right, grab that war. Buy my products. You love the store. You love the store. Get off the stage.

1396
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:38,620
100 bucks. Oh come on, be realistic. Be realistic. You're lucky I can do math. Oh I'm level 10. I

1397
02:28:38,620 --> 02:28:42,060
can hire a refling but I'm not going to have enough money to do it. But we'll do it again, okay?

1398
02:28:42,620 --> 02:28:47,020
I can afford, you can afford a cashier. Well I need to buy the thing as well. I actually,

1399
02:28:47,740 --> 02:28:50,220
you need to buy the cashier and you need to,

1400
02:28:53,740 --> 02:28:57,500
what do I need to, I don't know, I don't know. Oh my god, I'm getting stressed again. There's

1401
02:28:57,500 --> 02:29:02,220
too many customers. Why do you all come at once? I'm getting nervous. I'm getting nervous. Why do

1402
02:29:02,220 --> 02:29:09,420
you all come at once? She says, she said, aha that's what she said. No seriously, why do you all

1403
02:29:09,420 --> 02:29:15,420
pile up? By the last moment please. I'm getting stressed. Thank you for your custom but I'm getting

1404
02:29:15,420 --> 02:29:20,620
stressed. Right there's one more, one more customer and I think we're done. What is it? Oh no it's 8

1405
02:29:20,620 --> 02:29:26,860
p.m. There's a whole flock of new customers about to come in. Mummy likes tycoon games. Look, I do.

1406
02:29:26,860 --> 02:29:32,540
You know what game I really enjoy? And literally no one's played it. On the Nintendo DS there's

1407
02:29:32,540 --> 02:29:37,900
this game called Zoo Tycoon and you can like make all the animals happy in it and I adore that game.

1408
02:29:37,900 --> 02:29:41,820
It's like such a simplistic one. I don't know if I can make a stream out of it though. I think it's

1409
02:29:41,820 --> 02:29:46,940
a bit too boring but I love it. Folk leave in their offices there's a lot of them. It's trying to

1410
02:29:46,940 --> 02:29:56,380
get more vague Rievelin. You will be so damn bad for Sukiya. Will I actually be Suika? Suika. Suika.

1411
02:29:56,380 --> 02:30:03,420
Okay Suika. I'm very interested and I have a stream with Azura tomorrow. I'm so excited. I know you

1412
02:30:03,420 --> 02:30:09,820
can't see it but I need to put it up. No change. Thank you for the exact change. What would you like?

1413
02:30:09,820 --> 02:30:14,700
A card? Absolutely my good sir. Thank you. You know you look like that guy that just came in

1414
02:30:14,700 --> 02:30:19,980
two seconds ago. I don't know if you noticed that but hey ho. Caring for animals? I'm sold.

1415
02:30:19,980 --> 02:30:26,380
I play two three games every day. You play a variety of games every day? I like stick to one

1416
02:30:26,380 --> 02:30:31,580
game. I get addicted to one. Like thanks to streaming, unironically I get to play games for the first

1417
02:30:32,540 --> 02:30:41,740
time and just see what I enjoy. In June I got to play a buckshot roulette and that was fun as heck.

1418
02:30:41,740 --> 02:30:47,100
I did not expect how fun that was going to be. I am humping my desk for when the multiplayer comes

1419
02:30:47,100 --> 02:30:52,860
out. I'm sorry I'm gyrating. I think we're closed. I think we're closed. Lights out. What a beautiful

1420
02:30:52,860 --> 02:30:59,980
store. I will come back. I hear birds tweeting in game. We'll just have a little

1421
02:31:01,740 --> 02:31:03,260
is that in game or is that real life?

1422
02:31:05,820 --> 02:31:09,580
It may be real life. I'm sorry. It may be real life. There's birds tweeting. I forgot it's morning.

1423
02:31:10,140 --> 02:31:17,180
I forgot. It's 6 a.m. sorry. I just want to take an investigation around here. Is there like

1424
02:31:17,180 --> 02:31:24,700
anything in particular or is it just kind of a map? Hmm it seems to be that. Reef flanks!

1425
02:31:25,660 --> 02:31:30,060
Let me in! Reef flanks! I need my ink supply!

1426
02:31:33,100 --> 02:31:40,940
I start badgering your homes. Wake up! Wake up Reef flanks! Are you squidding me right now?

1427
02:31:42,060 --> 02:31:47,900
Let me in! I find this game boring but you make it entertaining as I got a stroke writing this.

1428
02:31:48,620 --> 02:31:54,460
Oh thank you Momo. I've thoroughly enjoyed this game but I can understand maybe the

1429
02:31:54,460 --> 02:32:00,540
gameplay a bit. Dry cleaners! Wake up! My uniform's dirty because of my reef flanks.

1430
02:32:03,260 --> 02:32:07,660
Only real strongy knocking if you knock eight times. You can knock on random strangers' houses.

1431
02:32:07,660 --> 02:32:12,380
Reef flanks I know you're in there. I didn't realize how big the map is like. Holy moly!

1432
02:32:13,180 --> 02:32:17,900
It's like an eight block. Oh there's a carcass. Uh sir?

1433
02:32:19,580 --> 02:32:24,460
Sir you're causing a carcass. Sir you need to you need to back up. Sir your your your

1434
02:32:24,460 --> 02:32:30,620
suspension's gone. You have no turning. What is going on here? Fresh! Fresh shut the

1435
02:32:30,620 --> 02:32:34,780
shower. At least with baby powder. What are you saying? Oh you're just a number.

1436
02:32:35,660 --> 02:32:39,820
Sir you're literally causing a traffic jam. How am I supposed to get deliveries if you're in the

1437
02:32:39,820 --> 02:32:45,420
way? Whoa! He just phased through that taxi. I too phased through the taxi. Are you squeezing me right now?

1438
02:32:47,020 --> 02:32:53,900
He is like two dollars I think. Thank you piano emu 1120 that's such a specific gamer tag I'm so

1439
02:32:53,900 --> 02:32:59,660
sorry. Thank you for your two dollars! Yank my two dollars now it's going to invest in my conglomerate.

1442
02:33:13,020 --> 02:33:17,180

1443
02:33:17,180 --> 02:33:24,700
doors to ask for ink uh from a person called refling honestly though. Ooh I can see the texture

1444
02:33:24,700 --> 02:33:32,940
of the map outline. I can see under the map which means we can fall under it. Fall under the map

1445
02:33:32,940 --> 02:33:38,540
in my video game store. This is wait what where do you go or did they just walk around infinitely?

1446
02:33:39,260 --> 02:33:44,060
I think they maybe just walk around infinitely you know that. Are you a night walker?

1447
02:33:46,060 --> 02:33:53,580
They go into their homes! Oh they've like actually put detail into this game sorry sorry but this
