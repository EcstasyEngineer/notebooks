it that collab stream was so fun looking at everyone else's designs i like at first i actually

03:25.280 --> 03:30.640
was like oh maybe i should have added our designs at the end just so we could critique what we like

03:30.640 --> 03:34.960
and don't like type thing like we could actually say like oh i don't like this i do like this but

03:34.960 --> 03:40.560
then i was like no the stream is about other streamers but please don't be surprised if you see

03:40.560 --> 03:47.360
some sort of variation that was so fun and i've seen like thigh rating streams i might do a tearless

03:47.360 --> 03:52.320
thigh rating because that was just so fun looking at other people's designs how many slimes were there

03:52.320 --> 04:00.960

06:52.960 --> 06:57.280
reeflings does person like you're my reefling like literally you're on my chest right now being

06:57.280 --> 07:06.960
jelly i was for content for me i think i'm about to upload a ASMR early access and

07:09.680 --> 07:16.480
that's it for today i don't have a collab coming out but i can't record anything oh my god your

07:16.480 --> 07:22.160
profile picture is that the pregnant you is that you and my tummy with that profile picture don't lie

07:22.240 --> 07:31.920
that reefling is literally being okay reeflings strung together it's the prego yes unfortunately

07:31.920 --> 07:39.840
i can't record any new ASMR because of my dad but he's come down with a cold um he cannot

07:40.400 --> 07:46.320
his scottish genes cannot handle the ozzy cold we went i think because we went out to the cafe

07:46.880 --> 07:51.920
and he's picked up a cold so i don't know how he's doing um he's like all sniffily he had to

07:51.920 --> 07:56.640
get medicine to go to sleep because he was so jet lagged and all that so i'm a bit worried about him

07:57.760 --> 08:04.160
um but next week is like two hour streams and no more like it cut off two hour streams and

08:04.160 --> 08:09.600
especially if my dad's not feeling well so yes we are gonna get stuck into it we have a hex

08:09.600 --> 08:15.360
add a polychrome to a random joker and destroys all other jokers so we are gonna make sure we

08:15.360 --> 08:25.440
remember we have this um um gain 25 bucks is a lot what's this one next is a joker and free

08:27.920 --> 08:36.320
i'm all in i'm all in on the the rewards discard two random hearts pair cards pair hand okay so

08:36.320 --> 08:42.000
it's been a hot second now we can do it by suit we could get a suit in theory but if it's gonna

08:42.000 --> 08:47.120
discard what we play i don't know get rid of the

08:50.480 --> 08:55.600
well i don't like this maybe go for a heart no of course because that would be too easy

08:55.600 --> 08:58.400
what we got jack 10 98 7

08:59.120 --> 09:12.080
I don't know what to go for a flush maybe we need a seven and we could get a flush going here

09:14.000 --> 09:17.760
we've only got two more discards left so i really shouldn't be doing this but

09:17.920 --> 09:26.720
oh dear oh dear oh dear i think i've absolutely twatted myself on this run

09:27.920 --> 09:30.880
a one pair is all i can get away with right now

09:34.720 --> 09:39.040
well we can't do a flush so just go for high cards

09:41.520 --> 09:46.640
absolute pitch we can do a pair that's the best we can do we have no more discards i'm sorry

09:46.640 --> 09:50.560
i got cocky okay oh wow i've thrown so hard

09:54.640 --> 10:00.400
i'll do another pair shout out to all my pairs yeah i've thrown wow

10:02.720 --> 10:05.600
oh that was such a good start as well with the offers

10:06.320 --> 10:16.240
yeah drat i've absolutely abysmal this i can only play a high card here one pair

10:17.360 --> 10:18.560
and what i'll get rid of these

10:21.520 --> 10:25.200
one pair and play i'm so sorry curses upon the

10:26.160 --> 10:31.840
aw throwing yeah full house i don't know if we're gonna make it though

10:32.160 --> 10:39.360
drat just shy that honestly just shy let's try that again that was such good

10:39.360 --> 10:45.360
planes though right we've got the polychrome doubles your money well we can't even do that

10:45.360 --> 10:50.000
because we ain't got no money hi glad to see you playing the card game the gamble oh hold on sorry

10:50.000 --> 10:54.560
my tracking my iphone is right in the way so i can't actually see what i'm doing hold on i need

10:55.040 --> 10:56.080
need a recalibrate

11:00.160 --> 11:06.000
okay recalibrate warm-up game it's real okay the house strong it's gone no we already lost the

11:06.000 --> 11:12.640
house right i don't see a flush i see a triple though oh baby a triple okay we've got full house

11:12.640 --> 11:19.680
already off the bat very happy with that and this is again just a shorter stream so please do not

11:20.240 --> 11:28.080
uh don't get too comfy we can't go that way i really need that skip card again i love that

11:28.080 --> 11:34.640
skip card for suits the high table wins again i can't believe it did you guys like that stream

11:34.640 --> 11:40.080
where we were reviewing the other uh folks uh designs i thought it was so cute oh we do have a

11:40.080 --> 11:47.120
suit sorry i saw a flush sorry a flush but it's all the same color there's no way i can't get

11:47.120 --> 11:55.600
comfy here with you he loved it i thought it was a fun idea right add a polychrome joker it destroys

11:55.600 --> 12:02.720
them the first hand of the round only has one card add a permanent copy of it could i just go out on

12:02.720 --> 12:14.400
aces uh playing cards can be purchased from the shop what one dna is good super early dna right let's

12:14.400 --> 12:20.720
go for it and then we're gonna use him right now okay then what we got a dollar so we can't do nothing

12:20.720 --> 12:27.280
with that okay but we've got a multiplier we're gonna go next base edition joker is free and

12:27.280 --> 12:32.560
becomes a foil but it's only 50 chips which i'm not that interested in is there an ace

12:35.120 --> 12:40.480
well they're just upgrade suits after we've gone through five thousand nine and two just one more

12:40.480 --> 12:45.600
round never seen any of the other videos to check them out they're pretty i know it was fun to see

12:45.600 --> 12:52.080
other do i hope you get inspired for gentle i do you right i'm gonna sip my tea ah it's already

12:52.080 --> 12:59.280
look warm well i do a king well i just do suit cards do king or should i save it for aces only i feel

12:59.280 --> 13:04.000
like it was a waste if i don't play it though if i first hand around only has one card add a permanent

13:04.000 --> 13:11.200
version of it let's just a kit let's do that here we go okay so king king king uh

13:13.840 --> 13:19.440
i can get rid of these please the natural girl dog and the paw patrol we're pretty cute

13:19.440 --> 13:24.000
and she's called the say so please which is so adorable absolutely adored it

13:24.000 --> 13:27.760
my god duble v here and we'll just play that don't mind us

13:28.480 --> 13:39.680
okay okay it feels good feels good feels good feels good right gains for consecutive hand

13:39.680 --> 13:43.840
played without a face so we absolutely do not want that we're going out on faces

13:45.200 --> 13:52.240
not interested and we have nothing that's really shaping our deck so i'm gonna hold on for economy

13:52.240 --> 14:02.800
playing cards now where you all space cards are debuff that's fine okay i'm gonna oh am i gonna

14:02.800 --> 14:14.640
regret this am i gonna regret doing this i'll duplicate it and save bucket okay we've got a pack

14:14.640 --> 14:20.640
i've got a twin and we'll play that because it's debuffed we're going out on high cards we're going

14:20.640 --> 14:27.200
all out what we've got queens and aces this is terrible hand let's get rid of all this nonsense

14:31.600 --> 14:40.080
we do have a double here and then get rid of the low it's pretty debuffed though oh dear well i've

14:40.080 --> 14:46.560
just absolutely ruined that run as well i'm really good at doing that like i'm really really good at

14:46.560 --> 14:55.440
ruining runs what am i looking at double what do i need a full house maybe

14:59.840 --> 15:02.080
ace king queen jack ten

15:05.680 --> 15:07.920
yeah that looks right

15:08.320 --> 15:19.600
oh we just made it we just made it we saved it we just made it okay we've got a stick

15:19.600 --> 15:22.640
a straight random multiplier

15:27.840 --> 15:35.040
do we hold on to economy or do we do misprint the chance of adding a 21 multi can come through though

15:37.920 --> 15:43.120
her hat was great detail honestly i love seeing other vtuber designs see what they come up with

15:43.120 --> 15:48.640
because obviously agency vtubers are signed whereas indie vtubers came up with a concept

15:48.640 --> 15:55.920
theirself which makes such a difference um definitely like right next round we'll we'll stick

15:55.920 --> 16:02.640
to economy we'll stick to economy gives five bucks per skipped blind gives five bucks no what are you

16:03.360 --> 16:10.240
initial cards and booster packs are sorry who goes there um identify yourself right king we're

16:10.240 --> 16:17.200
gonna activate playhand we're gonna double vr king so we've got more king we've got a full house

16:17.200 --> 16:22.880
lovely lovely it was not a very good burp oh my god she be rated my burp so if you didn't know a

16:22.880 --> 16:30.160
little behind the scenes for you um when you do a collab you all get in voice chat together one

16:30.160 --> 16:34.480
hour before the collab and like i was drinking my team we were just talking away and all that

16:34.480 --> 16:40.080
and i burped and she be rated it and i was like oh god i feel so embarrassed of the girls but

16:40.080 --> 16:47.840
she burps as well so it's oh no we've only got one hand to play oh i really don't want to end

16:47.840 --> 16:55.040
this run already it's such a good one let's see if we can spawn in an ace

16:59.040 --> 17:07.520
a full house 40 times four is like what and then plus the tens that's gonna that'll do it that'll

17:07.520 --> 17:14.400
do it sorry this is it this is it there we go easy peasy and it's a 1.5 multi i need to remember that

17:14.400 --> 17:21.600
so the the math is math and okay one six it's funny that you rate each other burps too honestly

17:21.600 --> 17:27.360
sorry i'm like no don't worry this isn't my usual start start time please don't worry if you for any

17:27.360 --> 17:33.920
vod watchers as well if you weren't here i purposely did not say that i was streaming after the

17:33.920 --> 17:41.520
collab so more people would be going to azura's way um but yes um i realized like oh i need to

17:41.520 --> 17:49.280
stream because uh if i don't i'm gonna break my little streaming streak 10 4 and a dna run

17:50.960 --> 18:00.400
each played 10 or 4 gives chips and plus 4 when scored oh that's so unique it's not times 4 it's

18:00.400 --> 18:04.160
plus 4 are we going pears

18:07.840 --> 18:09.840
are we shaping it into a pear run

18:13.680 --> 18:21.120
we might we might shape it into a pear run not economy i mean you can sell jolly whenever

18:21.200 --> 18:30.480
it doesn't work on me i check your channel daily ah always do the two pear run we need jolly for

18:30.480 --> 18:41.200
this next round though we need jolly who's jolly jolly joker uh these rounds have been

18:41.680 --> 18:51.760
true uh what we got one in seven gets drawn um i want to go pears i'm gonna regret this probably

18:51.760 --> 18:59.440
but we're gonna go pears shout out to all my pears two pears is urinus okay we're doing it

18:59.440 --> 19:06.800
we're doing we're shaping the run for pears uh initial cards and booster packs are free

19:07.360 --> 19:11.360
we have such low economy that might be good

19:13.520 --> 19:20.080
because we have low economy it's plus not times i know but if we start shaping it for pears

19:20.640 --> 19:24.880
don't worry about it i merely cried for one and a half hours because of serious straw name

19:24.880 --> 19:31.200
withdraw no don't forget a pair is still inside uh three of a kind of four of a kind or five yeah

19:32.160 --> 19:36.160
pears triples fill houses and cores this run is still wait open okay you know what else is

19:39.360 --> 19:43.360
because we have low economy i am actually gonna go for it i'm sure i'm gonna regret it but

19:44.640 --> 19:47.520
okay let's duplicate as always

19:50.560 --> 19:57.040
do we have enough money to do no we do we can duplicate duplicate got it that's what i

19:57.040 --> 20:04.480

20:30.080 --> 20:36.160
whispering in my ear when you see something because i keep missing them we're gonna go out on this

20:36.160 --> 20:44.560
yeah that was 800 and one plan so i guess 800 again oh yeah okay good good good good pears are

20:44.560 --> 20:50.720
the way to go sorry they actually are right we got seven for that uh with a diamond displayed

20:51.520 --> 20:59.440

28:35.360 --> 28:37.520
yapping out my arse right now right what are you

28:39.840 --> 28:41.760
sly joker really isn't that good

28:42.160 --> 28:50.000
i want a joker off the bat so we can use this

28:54.240 --> 29:00.640
sure one plus this card why not it's not the best but now he offers us 1.5

29:02.560 --> 29:09.680
it's not the best i know i know it's not the best but i'm making do with what i have okay

29:10.560 --> 29:12.480
with them it appears you're playing you might want that

29:14.720 --> 29:20.880
right queen double double get rid of the nine so we got another pair it's not worth it shaking

29:20.880 --> 29:27.680
my head my head well you know what else i like to shake my willy after a pee because apparently

29:27.680 --> 29:32.160
you have to like muck about with your sausage after your pee which is really funny to me

29:34.000 --> 29:36.480
we're just going all out and doubles at this point let's be honest

29:36.720 --> 29:42.080
i didn't know do you not have to shake after you do a number one

29:44.720 --> 29:50.000
a when blind is selected create two common jokers must have room

29:53.200 --> 29:55.840
when blind is selected i'm gonna get two for free

29:56.560 --> 30:09.200
yeah i do but do you do as well no that's not how it works for women

30:12.000 --> 30:19.200
chalkboard is so good three times multiplier if all cards held in hand are space and clubs

30:19.200 --> 30:25.520
the odds of me getting that is rubbish though that's awful that's like so hard to set up

30:26.320 --> 30:32.160
or we just get you to hold it for us if you don't you get the drop in the underwear

30:35.040 --> 30:38.720
uh you have to unless you want to pay the underwear tax

30:40.720 --> 30:44.720
the underwear tax i like that okay

30:46.720 --> 30:49.200
no we still have a double off the bat

30:49.760 --> 30:56.240
fuck off i hate when it does that when you roll for something better and it's like here's absolute

30:56.240 --> 31:01.520
piss and it's like okay thanks i don't know if we're gonna make it oh

31:05.440 --> 31:08.960

31:19.200 --> 31:24.800
oh my god i'm gonna have to actually use the lower cards are you serious game

31:27.040 --> 31:30.160
this is awful oh and it doesn't give me a double

31:32.240 --> 31:34.800
oh i've just fucking thrown

31:38.720 --> 31:41.600
okay we've lost this one as well why am i doing so bad

31:42.240 --> 31:53.600

31:54.640 --> 32:01.280

32:17.360 --> 32:25.200

in australia and i'm like can i just get a regular cola as in like a full fat sugary cola

32:36.560 --> 32:41.520

32:41.520 --> 32:46.720
next to her was like she's saying cola and he's like oh okay well she said coke and i'm like okay

32:46.720 --> 32:52.720

actually done a sweep there you know that can i get a king please not really can i get a king

33:01.040 --> 33:08.640
king that's a jack well whatever off you go no that i extend it i honestly don't

33:08.640 --> 33:13.600
think my accent's that strong at all but apparently is right we got three bucks ooh

33:13.600 --> 33:26.320
we're in the money i can't buy it i'm too poor are you serious

33:27.040 --> 33:35.120
i'm too poor to set up the best run are you serious

33:38.960 --> 33:41.840
right we're gonna take this 10 plus holographic

33:43.360 --> 33:50.160
and hopefully win this one we need jokers like off the dang bat but we're not getting them

33:50.160 --> 34:01.120
oh wait no that's not pair i've just wasted that so much are you serious i thought that was a pair

34:05.040 --> 34:10.000
why am i so blank i've literally thrown this one i've thrown so hard bra

34:10.000 --> 34:20.160
ah why do i suck so much today i'm so sorry all we're getting is red screen right stop

34:20.160 --> 34:24.000
i didn't lose it there's just a new game i don't know my game glitched out i don't know why it was

34:24.000 --> 34:31.520
happening something weird's going on with my screen i don't know what's happening

34:32.480 --> 34:39.520
i'm like i don't know okay i don't know there a straight go for it

34:42.800 --> 34:45.360
well i mean i've reached i only need 150 now

34:47.760 --> 34:52.000
give me something a bit better than that though right sure give me that

34:53.040 --> 34:56.560
shimmy oh wait no i should roll for a full house

34:57.440 --> 35:10.160
i absolutely despise when the game i absolutely get i get triggered when the

35:10.160 --> 35:14.240
game does that to me honestly right give me this free joker and it better be good

35:15.440 --> 35:18.800
each king held gives a multiplier oh that's actually really good

35:20.880 --> 35:24.880
adds the sale value of all other jokers owned to a multiplier

35:27.120 --> 35:33.920
i mean i guess i kind of need to go all out on jokers like right at the start or else we're

35:33.920 --> 35:42.000
not getting anywhere because we only have three hands right think about it logically

35:43.440 --> 35:50.240
what should i do if a king is held in the hand i get 1.5

35:51.200 --> 35:53.920
so

35:58.480 --> 36:07.440
the scar each king so i want more kings in my hand club flush is available

36:11.200 --> 36:15.520
fish for kings but don't play them keep clubs and king fish for a flush

36:15.600 --> 36:19.200
get rid of them then

36:25.520 --> 36:28.320
i hope that's what you're asking me to do refling

36:31.120 --> 36:35.200
okay so we have a flush and we're gonna keep that king in the hand

36:35.600 --> 36:48.000
oh okay okay oh yeah okay okay no let me get up gain three value at the end of a round

36:48.000 --> 36:57.040
oh is that like a stock market egg that's all he wrote um right we're gonna keep should we buy

36:57.040 --> 37:04.160
that and then just sell it spectral you want the spectral egg is pretty peak okay well we're

37:04.160 --> 37:10.480
going to do it invest in our future by buying the stock market egg and then we'll get the spectral

37:10.480 --> 37:16.880
pack to see what's inside why not add a blue seal destroy one random card in your hand

37:17.840 --> 37:22.960
um add a purple seal to the selected card you creates a turret when discarded

37:23.680 --> 37:30.080
create destroy one random right when discarded so put it on a low put medium on a low

37:30.960 --> 37:42.000
because it says discarded so surely i discard the lower cards yes is that how it works yes okay

37:42.000 --> 37:47.200
thank god i'm really out of it literally you don't you don't play a game for a little bit

37:47.200 --> 37:57.440
ooh free joker free joker all diamond cards are debuffed but free joker though

37:58.400 --> 38:05.520
yeah the more joker value also that goes up 25 bucks should i do should i do them both

38:06.960 --> 38:16.160
no no give me the free joker okay now we'll have a suit unfortunately a king would get consumed in

38:16.160 --> 38:20.400
that i'm not sure i want that

38:23.920 --> 38:29.600
because that would give times three keep the kings could discard the ace in the three

38:30.800 --> 38:33.520
and try and fish for another part

38:37.200 --> 38:44.160
when discarded fuck you beach increase the rank of two selected cards

38:46.160 --> 38:51.840
can i do what i think i can do and then wait level up the queen

38:54.480 --> 38:59.760
strength the queen now that's a blush should i level up the queen in the jack

39:01.520 --> 39:06.160
queen and jack increases the rank of up to two selected cards by one

39:07.280 --> 39:15.040
yeah okay yeah all right i'm doing it really see what it comes out to if i do this

39:15.680 --> 39:18.240
we've got 1.5 for every king held

39:22.640 --> 39:26.560
oh we did it we did it we did it and our little egg went up in value

39:27.840 --> 39:34.160
okay not bad what are you the first hand of round is a single is a single six destroy it and

39:34.160 --> 39:46.480
create a spectrum oh curious curious curious it to double dip it's a multi put it after the pirate

39:46.480 --> 39:55.440
yard okay we'll hold on to our economy again unfortunately we don't really have anything

39:55.440 --> 40:01.280
that's actually shaping other than the kings might want to move your first joker to the end

40:02.240 --> 40:08.080
to apply all the multis that come in my little egg is now worth five dollar e-dos

40:09.200 --> 40:11.680
can use six cents to thin the deck out of that

40:13.440 --> 40:16.880
well and get rid of the the weird ones and

40:23.440 --> 40:30.400
destroy it and create a spectrum okay we're gonna hold on to our economy king maxing for real

40:30.800 --> 40:36.160
yes now baron multiplies the thing yeah right we're king maxing let's see what we've got nope

40:36.160 --> 40:44.400
don't do that right we've got two kings off the bat and let's see what we've got we've got a double

40:45.840 --> 40:52.960
eight it's not the best if first hand of is a six well we don't actually have one could fish for a

40:52.960 --> 41:03.520
six all right let's do that let's do that guess i'll go if myself right throw away these

41:06.240 --> 41:14.240
uh and we'll get a turret creates a random joker a card must have room sure two chips for each

41:14.240 --> 41:22.880
remaining card in the deck sure why not and knock yourself out right i think we're in trouble

41:23.520 --> 41:32.000
we have one discard left six gaming wait can i keep doing it if first hand of round is a six no

41:32.560 --> 41:37.040
just one six it only works on one six cents oh i just realized the card's called six cents

41:38.560 --> 41:41.840
play the six alone wait have i played a hand yet no

41:42.960 --> 41:44.560
uh play this one because it's useless

41:45.280 --> 41:56.240
wow add a red seal re-trigger this card one time wait if i add a seal to a king is it gonna trigger

41:57.040 --> 41:58.960
baron twice

41:59.440 --> 42:14.560
oh my gosh oh my gosh now i am struggling to get anything to play

42:19.600 --> 42:24.160
now we just need a copier card this is gonna be crazy it'll be what's left in the deck

42:24.640 --> 42:31.360
hmm we're kind of looking at getting tens or aces to come in

42:34.160 --> 42:41.600
spades flush could be an option and kids we only have one more discard left though

42:44.240 --> 42:51.040
on average we wouldn't draw it though i'd be forced to play like an ace or a king or something

42:52.000 --> 43:00.880
um diamond is the most likely suit you're right but diamonds are debuffed completely

43:02.720 --> 43:07.200
through the joker as well i'm not doing anything

43:10.000 --> 43:16.560
two plus chips and then egg or beloved egg i will sell egg soon oh he's four he's plus 14

43:16.560 --> 43:23.040
the sell value i guess he swashbuckler and egg actually kiss each other very nicely i say we

43:23.040 --> 43:31.280
look for tens and nine fuck it fuck it i've got a double here a double there and get rid of the two

43:32.160 --> 43:35.680
i know these are debuffed i'm aware but i think we're okay

43:36.960 --> 43:43.840
but the kings that are okay yeah we're fine the kings are having fun the kings are having fun don't

43:43.840 --> 43:46.560
worry right whoo what's this

43:48.240 --> 43:56.400
hmm that's big one times multiplier for each empty joker hmm we have no for me

43:58.640 --> 44:04.160
the double kings are popping off choose one of three playing cards i mean loyalty cards

44:05.040 --> 44:09.600
we can always sell something later like as i said the egg maybe we can sell later he's worth eight

44:09.600 --> 44:22.640
bucks at the moment um king is carrying oh right hard hard hard okay choose two up to two

44:22.640 --> 44:29.360
four spectral cards we use immediately right i'll do a loyalty card we can always sell it if we're

44:29.360 --> 44:37.840
not feeling it you know it's not a big deal um let's see what we're up against though oh no

44:38.800 --> 44:45.520
we're gonna have to get rid of something oh but we can't double skip the shop or else it's not

44:45.520 --> 44:51.600
gonna play next based edition shop joker is free and polychrome it's a times 1.5

44:57.840 --> 45:03.920
should i do it i feel like once we sell the egg it's fine to have low economy because the egg is

45:03.920 --> 45:08.560
currently eight we might sell them next round you might want to look at the hands we can play

45:13.120 --> 45:20.240
well i do spectrum the egg is buffing the pirate it is you're right

45:25.680 --> 45:29.200
ideally we want a few kings our deck is five and we want to get more

45:29.920 --> 45:34.960
hmm i don't know if the standard pack's gonna give me what i want no what's the spectral card do

45:34.960 --> 45:40.400
you want spectral yeah sell the egg next round okay i'm gonna do the spectral in exchange of the egg

45:40.400 --> 45:47.520
what are these destroy one random but give two enhanced aces i want king add a gold seal three

45:47.520 --> 45:54.320
bucks earned when this card is played convert all cards into a single random rank one heart

45:54.400 --> 46:05.440
upgrade every poker by one i mean it wouldn't take away or remove a king it would just have an

46:05.440 --> 46:11.360
extra ace all levels is free black hole is always good all right let's pop black hole

46:13.520 --> 46:19.760
what did that do oh we can have a second chance okay well we just do gold seal destroy a random

46:19.760 --> 46:24.640
card in your hand but it gives you two enhanced aces i mean i feel like it's probably gonna attack

46:24.640 --> 46:28.160
something we don't want right if a card is played so we'll shove it on a queen

46:30.000 --> 46:34.880
if we make all cards the same rank we could get something nice though but it puts my hand size down

46:34.880 --> 46:45.360
by one which scares me it scares me i'm scared i'll do the gold if i if i lose i right we're

46:45.360 --> 46:51.440
gonna skip to get our times i assume if i skip again it's not gonna show them up is it

46:53.200 --> 46:57.760
because i'm sure i played a game where i skipped and i only got offered one joker card

47:03.040 --> 47:10.640
bad bad bad belt troll player honestly can anyone you'd get both for free i have to like oh i do

47:10.720 --> 47:17.440
right okay fuck it fuck it we're going all out right we've got a king and he re-triggers

47:17.440 --> 47:22.560
but he's debuffed so he's even gonna properly re-trigger all right let's see what we're looking at

47:23.920 --> 47:29.360
let's see what we're looking at we've got a tarot card if we discard what we're looking at suitwise

47:30.160 --> 47:37.200
we actually have a suit unbelievable king of clubs won't proc because he's debuffed unbelievable

47:37.200 --> 47:41.040
i could have put it on any other king and i picked that one right we're gonna throw away

47:41.040 --> 47:46.080
because we can get a tarot if we do this so well we just do a classic discard

47:48.320 --> 47:55.680
and see what we can fish for i think if we fish for more are you ah i was debuffed

47:58.880 --> 48:03.200
oh we're about to get a diamond flush i think we're gonna go for diamond flush

48:04.160 --> 48:11.120
are you fucking serious this is when the game like enrages me give me a diamond

48:13.200 --> 48:14.480
oh and it would be a king

48:22.000 --> 48:23.440
this game is such a troll

48:24.320 --> 48:33.680
such a troll oh we got three whoa oh no it's fine oh we're laughing to the bank it is fine

48:35.680 --> 48:39.600
i'll just play that then we literally did it in one whoa

48:44.400 --> 48:49.760

booster pack is opened that's so specific i do the fate i'm sorry if i'm completely messing

52:26.560 --> 52:34.880
this up it's very likely i am i don't have anything that is complimenting a specific

52:34.880 --> 52:44.720
play style yet yet one times five multiplier if a steel card stays in the hand we will pick that up

52:46.000 --> 52:53.280

54:08.960 --> 54:17.840
okay okay okay okay okay okay okay well our king wanted to be a steel streamer luck strikes again

54:17.840 --> 54:26.160
honestly right i'm going for a discard because these are rubbish ooh money if i play it earn

54:26.160 --> 54:32.400
three bucks if this card is played in scores okay let's do that and we'll keep the king and see what

to me i'm a terrible influence oh come on play three of a kind sure three of a kind get rid of that

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.800
let's see what the multipliers look like on three of a kind

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:40.080
23 not bad at all okay i think i'm gonna try and hold on to economy

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:47.360
one and four chance for each played eight to create a random tower new up to three i think

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:52.960
i'm gonna try and hold on to economy stop it we need our brains to play no you don't want to

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:59.760
use your other head with me a replay don't be such a stinker the standard pack gives

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:06.400
point to five molly should i get rid of the stone boy he keeps fucking me up i'll replace the

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:18.400
stone boy when we get something good when the when blind is selected stone is buffing holographic

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:24.960
though this is a hard one again we've not really got anything that's shape and anything

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:35.280
i think we just go next right 10k all heart cards are debuffed understood

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:47.120
hmm we've got two kings you love to see it right heart cards are debuffed so get out of here

01:02:53.680 --> 01:03:00.800
juicy juicy juicy maybe play a pair and just see i'm gonna play a pair and see what the point five

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.120
times on the kings is gonna be okay

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:07.280
other head go

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.160
stone's not hard enough what does it do

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:20.320
i was 2000 okay okay let me get up let him get up let them get up right we now have four

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.440
should i get rid of him because he doesn't do anything

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:31.440
oh my clubs are buffed lose the king of hearts yeah he can't do anything at all for us

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.800
well i keep the ace have i got another ace i do have another ace

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:44.880
right let's let's see what we've got create up to two random tarot cards that's so specific

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:55.120
sure what's inside speeds are my speeds well who's the speed that's a club

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:59.440
draft destroy two selected cards what like right now

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.120
i mean i guess

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:10.080
we can thin the deck out a bit okay i'll what destroy a two and an eight

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:16.640
could make a space flush right now artificially yes i can

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:31.120
so one two and three no three then make them speed prank them john and then one two three four five

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:38.480
sure yeah sure that'll work right

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:46.560
hey we did it we did it we did it do the card thing now no if i destroyed it i wouldn't have

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:55.200
been able to do the flush played cards with speeds wait whoa what's going on with the 1.5

01:04:55.280 --> 01:05:02.400
oh wait wait wait re-triggers all played face cut oh no played not sitting in my hand

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:07.440
1.5 who would we give up the stone

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:12.080
give up the stone for the wreath yes

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:22.080
okay yes we're in agreement okay i am so smart uh i'm gonna buy the blank because i i've still

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:26.640
yet to freaking grab the thing i don't know what unlocks when we do the blank we're still not done

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:32.400
it one playing card three i mean i'm like did we just spend our economy at this point

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.240
i must i must be patient i must behave

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:43.920
but i could add more kings to the deck though did you think about that

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:53.200
hmm take a standard and see i would spend to get the hologram off what hologram steel joker

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:59.680
we want space speed card will she be tempted by greed greed run

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:08.080
we have enough kings okay okay okay okay i will hold on to economy because we're gonna need to start

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:15.120
pumping up them numbers those are ricky numbers okay must play five cards in each hand that is fine

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:21.520
by me we can spade kings or steel we want to have three kings in hand and then play a spade flush

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.840
i'm not sure how good i can optimize the run like that

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:35.840
uh it might be worth grabbing this one to make sure we're fine in the psychic

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:43.040
bains the psychic of isaac whoa okay what room three bucks have played retrigger

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:55.760
um okay we have enough we have a double let's see how much we get and if i get a lower card

01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:02.960
i'll use the hanged man okay yeah okay right hanged man i'm gonna use on the stone and on the two

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:10.960
surely this is correct we need money for doubling argument yeah do your best mommy i'm trying

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:15.840
i've like forgotten all of my skills right now i'm being so daft

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.720
if we roll an eight

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:27.040
if we roll an eight

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:36.080
if oh for fuck's sake we're not getting it right we're not getting it it's fine it's

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:39.120

draft

01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:58.560
draft

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:09.760
right okay queen is that was a bit of a waste of money i shouldn't have done that i failed for it

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:17.600
i fell for it right now this one four of spades is too good oh did i pick wrong

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:28.560
oopsies i picked wrong i'm sorry i forgot uh i think we should skip it says must play five

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:35.280
cards if we can roll the kings into our hand like instantly i think i think we're winning because

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:42.800
22k is a tall order are you guys okay if we skip who goes there i would skip too yeah we have

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:52.640
wrathful joker i'm very small brained i'm sorry oh whoa this is exactly what we were looking for

01:10:52.640 --> 01:11:00.880
right hold on let's analyze the situation analyzing me analyzing what we got have we got a suit oh we

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:04.800
do we could do the suit

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:15.840
a spade flush should i play the queen right now for the extra three bucks just in case

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:23.520
a but high card and queen first right okay well so queen and then just take away all of this rubbish

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:28.960
as well so we can get our three bucks and then i'll do the flush deal deal okay we'll do that don't

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:35.840
worry oh no he's twitching oh no it's fine oh thank goodness okay it's okay you're allowed to twitch

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:42.480
it's fine it's fine you're allowed to twitch okay you did the king oh wait did i just throw away a king

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:53.360
oops you don't like it when it twitches oh sorry i don't know what's happened all of a

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:56.800
sudden i don't know how to play battle throw and it's only been like what how much

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:01.600
a loyalty card yeah no

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:06.880
a loyalty card came through earned money at the end of a round

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:12.720
do we want that i mean loyalty card would have to give it up

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:21.360
i'm gonna say something controversial i think get rid of loyalty card and then raise our economy

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:28.480
artificially so we can start really going and hammering into packs because we're needing help

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:34.640
let me just throw in for more content yes lose loyalty yeah i think loyalty is just it's only

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:44.080
coming in so i'm gonna go max out on economy one of four uh one consumable slot one of these up

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:50.080
here i don't really need that it only works one six at a time yeah it's not really coming through

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:56.480
okay destroy a random card creates a random rare joker but it sets your money to zero

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:06.400
i don't even have space for um i wish that was a negative joker but it's not destroy five but gain

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:17.280
money um add a gold seal i think add a gold seal add a gold seal yeah nice and nice and safe gold

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:23.040
seal a bit boring but we're going to try and artificially inflate our economy right we've

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:30.720
got destroy one random card in the hand but add four enchanted just converts all cards in hand

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:41.600
to a single random suit now if that paid off it would be 50 50 if we got clubber speed that is

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:50.640
one to consider destroy one random card no and creates a joker i think we're gonna risk it for

01:13:50.640 --> 01:14:01.120
sigil i think we'll risk it for sigil yeah okay 50 50 we want club or spade

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:10.640
okay okay it's not the end of the world it's not the end of the world it's okay it's okay

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:18.240
it is a 50 50 if we got something it's not the end of the world okay it's fine it's fine

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:24.320
all right we're gonna hold on to the the money since we can't really spend anything else

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:30.400
upgrade four of a kind by three levels that's like such a good artificial inflation though

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:41.280
um initial cards are free next shop no i'm gonna try and play i've never we never played

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:50.240
four of a kind you're absolutely right we oh okay okay okay okay let him get up uh

01:14:50.640 --> 01:15:02.400
um okay okay okay i definitely want to throw these out oh it has to score it has to score do

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:11.680
not be fooled play the queen of clubs and nothing else just her on her own right so that's an economy

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:22.240
shot and then we'll go for a spade flush okay happy with that and then we'll go for a spade

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:32.320
and then we'll go for a spade thank you we'll definitely play you do and then all of you

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:37.840
together and we get an extra three bucks on top go show me what i want to see

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:48.000
oh baby that's exactly what we wanted to see and we got an extra money so we made 10 bucks

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:58.160
that round well we made a bit more than 10 if we full house we won so easy great one all good

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:03.520
leave it to me uh right we never economies jumped up

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:12.880
money uh we don't need a consumable slot a tarot if we could transfer something into speeds

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.000
select two cards and convert the left into the right

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:21.600
uh

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:27.680
hmm we could maybe get another spade on our side

01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:32.400
our emperor just go emperor

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:43.920
fuck it okay doubles money right i'll take it enhances one card into a glass

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:54.640
turn stone into a queen uh probably should all right we're gonna get money will we use a glass

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:02.080
it has a chance to absolutely destroy it though which is pretty high right we'll see if we've got

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.080
hmm

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:20.960
last space yeah i'm i'm clean too always do yeah yeah why did you go up this joker gains uh every

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:28.480
time a playing card is added to the deck i am a dumbass i understand okay we don't want these

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:34.560
these aren't good enough these are all given like 1.5s and stuff let's let's stick to the

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:41.600
1.5s hologram we will try and level up hologram now we can't get rid of the golden joker possibly

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.120
hmm uh yeah i'm kind of like golden joker

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:58.160
understand's brain has so many wrinkles put the joker on the right to the left

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:04.720
yes no don't get rid of them just yet okay well wait until something better comes up than

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:13.600
abstract joker it's not bad but it's not exactly mind boggling okay we never play four of a kind

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:20.160
so nice try game but we will not be tempted by your demon abilities right what we looking at

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:27.760
we could try and roll for a club's flush and play the queen

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:34.640
we could go for a club's flush what you feeling are you want to queen into inside

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:40.480
i can't even pretend to understand the game honestly i didn't understand it when i first

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:47.840
played but it's just like a chill little thing queen queen five five queen queen five five and then

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:59.200
get rid of the nine and now get rid of the six no get rid of the nine queen queen five five nine

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:08.560
i'm i don't know if i messed up i tried oh i got 10k for that hand okay i i would really love

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:11.280
if we could get the thing that gives us another hand because

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:17.600
it's getting a bit i'm getting shaky okay i'm getting a bit nervous um

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:26.720
now we can do a double get rid of the five

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:39.040
i'd fish for more kings double pair again i mean it has to make

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:48.320
i could just discard these two and see if we can get king from it well close enough

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:53.600
full house right i'll take a full house and we should get a king after this

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:02.720
we should get a few hits as well okay yeah we're fine we're fine smooth sailing smooth sailing

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:09.200
don't worry don't worry don't panic don't panic you're fine we have three more discards but we

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:16.160
need a hand we're not really there's two more jacks in an ace so yeah even if we play like a singular

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:25.840
here discard for more spades really that's enough space oh no we are the likelihood of

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:37.600
rolling a speed is very high okay we would have to get those are you fucking serious

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:42.000
speed

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:49.920
okay that's exactly yeah yeah okay one two three four five nice nice nice nice okay we're done

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:58.000
we're done it's piece of lemon squeezy classic voucher honestly four hundred and one thousand

01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:59.520
one hundred and fourteen thousand Jesus

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:15.440
right uh i am needing help very badly we're starting to get very like skin of our teeth

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:20.480
which i don't like gold seal enhances that bonus clubs

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:28.800
clubs and spades i think we're gonna have to change some things into clubs yo the flush joker

01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:35.200
your record is still 2.5 million moon or yeah i'm thinking moon honestly

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.440
i think it's better to convert

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:51.600
make our spades into bonus i feel like it's because we have an artificial amount of diamonds

01:21:51.600 --> 01:22:01.280
at the moment i want to even up the playing field and try and get more spades oh that would give us

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:09.280
clubs moon the hearts four

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:16.480
to get rid of even less chance of a heart yeah

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:24.400
we have more diamond than clubs we're better off just dusting off the clubs not going for balance

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:25.200
um

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:34.960
so then more multi-card select two into a multi-card right we'll do it into clubs

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:42.800
and it spades fuck sorry spades clubs spades do you understand me yes okay

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:50.240
okay we've got multi-cards and we'll do one more i'm really bad at that i'm so sorry right

01:22:50.480 --> 01:23:03.520
two tarot cards multi again convert to spades right okay we're happy with spades i'm happy

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:17.280
with spades i think world nine king and and random nine oh wait i want to eliminate

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:24.000
me i want to eliminate hearts don't uh hearts is nine i would take the hearts down to seven

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:31.920
nine nine three someone says king doesn't matter we don't play him true thank you for reminding me

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:40.800
okay world world card a wild card okay a consumable saw enhances one selected card

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:46.400
in a stone that's absolute push don't ever talk to me again crafty joker a flush

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:52.480
no you're not no i don't accept

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:59.440
i hope we can do this but i'm getting very nervous for a run

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:10.160
we have six we have six hearts and we still pull a heart

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:15.920
fish for kings so what destroy the ten destroy the two

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:22.000
what do you do i get a tarot if you get discarded

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:29.280
it's okay okay we're getting rid of all these what did i get convert into clubs

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:34.560
right suit

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:38.400
just sell them

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:48.400
um

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:51.200
should i still go for the

01:24:54.880 --> 01:25:01.520
i try and get a king on board though right we want suits not kings right well just sell these

01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:04.080
turn the heart into a glass

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:13.360
i don't want to play hearts though i don't like i don't like the concept of glass cards

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:16.800
because i don't want to destroy anything right i'm sorry and this is going to frustrate you

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:21.680
but i don't like those cards so they're not getting played we're going to do for flush

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:24.880
and then we're going to hopefully get some kings as a result of this flush

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:32.240
what are we getting okay 20 cube

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:36.160
this is absolute piss this hand

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:49.040
this is awful what are we looking at 11 diamonds 13 clubs but hearts how am i still pulling

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:50.000
fucking hearts

01:25:55.360 --> 01:26:00.400
all my reeflings hey hark i just i don't like the concept of like that the card can be destroyed

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:11.200
i don't know why i'm being silly maybe but right you go away you can go away i don't know maybe we

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:16.880
should i don't know i don't know what to play get rid of clubs and just go all out on spades

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:22.000
oh no i clicked play

01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:30.960
i clicked play are you serious i didn't mean to click it

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:42.000
oh it was a miss click right so we know this is a suit right so what do i need

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:50.400

01:27:55.680 --> 01:28:01.360
can do it we have to win one round right shop has a rare free joker we're gonna go all out on the

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:07.280
free jokers if we lose it doesn't matter because we've only just gotten started honestly it's not a

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:16.880
big deal so let's get rid of these let's get rid of these there we go it doesn't matter if we lose

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:22.320
because we're going all out on to get free jokers well we went that was yeah that was a really

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:31.280
difficult run i've never kind of done anything of that nature i mean let's go full house and just

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:37.200
i know it's not going to count on some of the cards but bro i just need one more hand we're just

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:47.840
fine we do have one more hand one more hand do we i have only one more discard uh i actually

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:53.040
don't like the look of this i want to get rid of the diamonds the odds of them showing up are really

01:28:53.040 --> 01:29:04.480
low play a pair we need 12 cheats throw the diamonds based cheats on pair of men oh the

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:14.480
pair of nines win are you sure 20 oh you're right why do i doubt you little reeflings i should not

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:25.120
doubt i have filthy okay three times multiplier if you have at least 16 and hat and then times three

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:31.200
on a straight over good well if we could get that card that lets you skip a straight oh that would be

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:40.560
great and she's like my back hand i play way too much belt drill oh god i'm so bad now you're fine

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:49.760
now do we we can spend because we're not going to get a bonus interest so we might as well spend

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:56.880
and see what we can get create a tarot card a poker hand contains an ace or a straight well

01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:06.560
if we could find that card that lets us jump then honestly honestly right we're going to try and

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:12.880
find that card that lets us jump the odds of us getting it are tiny but i'm not moment and me what's

01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:17.920
i have to go back so this is a bit of insider knowledge um i reviewed what the script master

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:24.560
made for ac and i specifically said take out all of this meme language because i was like ac's first

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:30.320
language is in english as well as this gets very convoluted and confused in the girls like we

01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:34.480
specifically make the recording times really easy on them because i don't want them to be worried

01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:39.520
about like this big massive essay of the script and then she be has just shown me what's already

01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:44.880
been submitted for her and we're glorping glizzle sticks or wherever the frick the sayings are and

01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:50.080
i was like aw i thought i dealt with that but i'm gonna have to ask script master to now go back

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:55.520
and take out all the memes because yeah uh i'm gonna have to ask them to take it a bit more

01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:01.360
serious because yeah i'm not sending glorp your glizzle sticks to the girls to freaking perform

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:06.800
that's absolutely awful do cold reads of the scripts well it's content is annoying for me

discard two three four six and ten

01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:36.080
we have a king queen 10 and 9

01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:44.240
i agree i agree we have to throw for her now you're not throwing don't be so stinky

01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:49.520
we need a jack and we have a straight for high multi

01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:50.640
hmm

01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:58.560
well get rid of the name if we get a jack it's two dollars extra how

01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:07.600
really there there are only four jacks but 11 more hearts what's wrong with hearts

01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:20.080
two four strips each hand is a dollar oh okay queen queen nine nine and a three

01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:29.520
oh i see she became by and said hi yes they did the adorable darlings emmy and sheepsters came in

01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:35.600
so we want to win on the for endurance and only ink when she wins around i'd be so down to that

01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:44.000
i'd be so down for it right everyone group time i'm getting fucking rolled

01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:52.960
okay i'll play this hand see what happens it's okay okay we got that we got this we got we got

01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:59.280
money we got money money we got 300 for that that's 100 tips plus 20 from the queens and the nine

01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:07.280
there's no way you can do maths that good to know that's insane

01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:19.600
quick king king 10 10 3 is this enough there's no way you can do the math that quickly that's

01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:25.520
insane do you have autism how can you do the math that quick

01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:35.280
all cards and packs in the shop are cheaper 100 chips this joker gains for each thingy

01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:45.040
yes i have no diagnosis but i just like math and poker maybe it's maybe it's your special interest

01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:51.040
what a question i just have this stuff i i cannot do the math like that okay i cannot add

01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:56.480
don't know how you're doing it you underestimate autism all your tisms are belong to us

01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:02.240
nearly 10k and it's not enough for her nearly 10k tentacles and none of what do the reeflings get

01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:08.800
if we make you win i already owe you like two audios and then i owe even more audios on top

01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:18.640
skip not even the clearance sale money for range balotro audio and i bag second in line are you

01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:23.520
second in line okay thank you reluctantly saying thanks for the tip i'm so sorry if i scared anyone

01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:29.040
with my rage but oh my god i start throwing things at the wall when i get ready to throw

01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:38.640
all my cards get the hollow get the hollow clearance is good right wait do i have another round

01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:46.320
up coming up coming what have i got i can skip for a rare joker for next i don't know if we should

01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:58.160
do that wait early hologram is great if i buy clearance sale will it be cheap enough to get

01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:05.360
strongly the rage draws more people in are you people actually enjoy rage streams

01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:13.760
no it won't multi everything else clearance will be their next shop okay we will get the multi

01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:22.160
and we have six bucks so we don't we'll just go next i love your range buying clearance would

01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:26.640
take two dollars off okay we'll buy clearance next time because i think it does help overall with

01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:33.360
economy that is kind of shy sense of bonus did we skip for the free joker is the question

01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:37.120
we have six joker slots and we could get something that might shape a deck

01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:44.080
we'll skip i think skip skip okay let's get our free joker we can maybe sell it for money for

01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:52.720
really want okay okay let me analyze i'm analyzing i see jack jack three three and throw the two

01:56:54.720 --> 01:57:00.240
and jack jack three three oh wait ignore that no don't skip if you want to buy clearance

01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:09.280
okay jack jack three three and two so we have queen jack ten we need two cards for a straight

01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:13.200
i mean we have the guaranteed two pair right now i don't know how much it's gonna give though

01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:23.040
how much is the street in terms of a multiplier straight is a hundred times eight double is

01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:32.480
20 times two i hate to say it we might be better off going for a place oh wait did i look at the

01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:35.920
wrong one sorry i looked at the wrong one i said i looked at straight flush sorry sorry sorry sorry

01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:44.240
sorry all right um it's really not straight is four i love when you read just not hot

01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:49.440
don't aim for the low that's how you lose all the previous runs so looking for a club flush would

01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:54.320
be the best but right now holographic joker gives you nothing because i've yet to add a card to the

01:57:54.320 --> 01:58:00.720
dirt but he is lurking look at him lurking in the shadows getting ready flush is honestly the most

01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:07.920
generally powerful hand in the game unless you get op builds yeah i'm i've won consecutively

01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:15.680
jude so what throw away these four and throw away a jack and then get a king and a nine in

01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:26.240
and go for like a king a nine an ace here jack jack three three two should score four hundred

01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:33.920
it's a bit on the lower side keep the jack and throw away the wee ones

01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:42.720
one forget backseat streaming you guys are the stream we want a flush look for clubs

01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:49.920
look for clubs that makes my hand even smaller oh well we actually might get clubs

01:58:52.000 --> 01:59:00.880
what am i looking at here that's kind of we're one off of a club but we've got such a strong hand

01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:08.240
or layer for pin pals and harem shebe is live yes don't be afraid we'll probably redirect into

01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:14.400
sheepsters if she's up you know you know who else is up my penis oh emi's in the stream too oh they

01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:20.480
didn't impromptu stream together okay i'll redirect into them if we lose her when doesn't matter

01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:25.600
i'll just put a big warning in the title and be like i failed shebe is collabing with emi oh what

01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:32.880
are they doing i'm allowed to stalk them hold on i'm just gonna make sure i'm redirecting into them

01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:38.320
because i don't want to i don't want to waste it okay i don't want to waste it redirect

01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:47.280
shebe gorilla oh my god something something giggles stick with emi what are they doing are

01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:53.200
they reading the scripts live i swear if they're reading the scripts live they're playing with

01:59:53.200 --> 02:00:00.720
their giggles to stop we only have ace ace jack jack six should i do it ace ace jack jack six

02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:06.400
i think we should i think we need to start getting points down

02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:10.080
no wait

02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:15.440
what is in our deck this is in our deck

02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:22.240
that is exactly what they're doing okay well as long as they're having fun

02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:26.320
as long as they're having fun that's the main thing

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.720
you want to aim for high multi you have to choose to either dig or play hands we can't do both

02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:39.520
well you guys better start using your one brain cell that you share if i discard for non clubs nice

02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:47.040
dick bro yeah yeah you like that i've got a big dick yeah it's a script that was red is real i'm

02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:52.240
pretty sure it's the least costly i have no idea if they've gone and edited it to make it a bit more

02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:56.400
if we go for club suit

02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:02.480
if we want to win hard we need to get a straight or a flush

02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:06.480
i would have to get rid of the ten the queen

02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:13.520
and the jack and the ace and just go all out for a speed but that's terrible

02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:22.880
a royal flush of clubs so is how you use that big thick what's left in our deck

02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:26.560
it's not looking good that's all i'm gonna say

02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:34.960
i would discard just the diamonds and leave these guys in

02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:46.960
hmm

02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:05.120
that was not supposed to work out but it did that was not supposed to work out by most certainly good

02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:15.120
woo right okay unfortunately we've got rid of our tens really um right so if i do a jack is that

02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:29.520
enough no it's not no no any hand wins that's it i don't think so wait blue joker blue joker

02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:38.320
it will be with the plus chips take a look i will math i don't know how any of this right

02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:41.680
i mean we've got another two hands so it's fine all you do win

02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:49.040
i do okay okay okay right not as a free joker let me see

02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:58.640
each played card with diamond suit gives 1.5 win scored suit will change at the end of each round

02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:02.880
sure and you come knock yourself out right

02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:14.480
do we want to buy i think we want to buy voucher now or we're gonna lose it yeah we're gonna lose

02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:21.040
voucher now i know i know but everything's a bit cheaper i know our economy's low i know i know i

02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:28.560
know right base chips and mullies have had we're not winning this bro we are not winning this

02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:36.480
i'm so tired eight seven six five four which we don't have we have a double we're very close to a

02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:44.560
suit as well go super hard for diamonds is that what it is it's diamonds right now

02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:52.320
we have it what's our new joker ancient it wants diamonds

02:03:52.720 --> 02:04:02.400
uh should i just throw for diamonds yeah diamond what take out the lower cards

02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:09.200
new fish for diamond mommy about to lose and be really angry and the script master's gonna get

02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:10.560
triggered and and he's

02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:20.720
the queen too okay diamonds out all out on diamonds okay okay

02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:32.080
what i'm worried about is if i don't discard this damn king we're gonna get rolled the king too

02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:40.240
discard all non diamonds okay ying wait should i just go for i can't go for a flush

02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:47.520
uh right level one flush surely this is gonna work surely

02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:57.120
okay okay okay okay so he's now spades

02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:03.120
okay okay we've got nine bucks do we want to do anything

02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:17.360
i really think so i'd buy the standard pack since hologram standard pack okay that's two

02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:20.480
if two of you say the same thing i'm just like yes yes

02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:26.240
uh we could do money we could do money or we could do 10

02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:38.000
up to you you want the queen yeah queen money okay darling right so that did upgrade our hologram

02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:42.640
and then we go next next

02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:50.000
stones are shite unless you've got a deck around them i think that'd be very specific okay next

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:56.800
it is re-rolls the next shop nope ooh we've got a 1.5 joker coming up though

02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:07.760
uh right off the bat uh close to one wait what are you spades just throw for spades

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:14.160

in the name of the spades we throw i'm gonna that's spades

02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:30.240
in the name of the spades we throw

02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:40.640
uh huh

02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:52.160
play the trash okay i'll play the trash i read play the trash i'm playing

02:06:54.080 --> 02:07:02.080
yeah yeah oh wait okay i know this looks crazy but let me just play it for the money and then

02:07:02.080 --> 02:07:10.400
we'll do a thingy we need that money don't worry we've got it we've got it go

02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:21.680
ta-da see we got it see you are worried about nothing okay we definitely if we could get a card

02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:28.960
that goes for like a flushes three of a canes no straight no we want flushes

02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:38.960
what am i doing okay i think we just need a you want a standard pack okay

02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:50.800
ooh fancy cards we've got a foil stone a planet if it's held money if the card is held

02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:54.400
creates a turret when discarded

02:07:56.320 --> 02:08:00.480
or we can use it as a multiplier in a scary situation

02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:05.520
because three fours at the time won't discard any given card okay

02:08:06.240 --> 02:08:14.240
so clubs ace of clubs may come in clutch for safety so he's now at 1.5 uh what's arena do

02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:16.160
oh it's a turret anything else

02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:25.840
kiki or dago next we can take the arcana you want it

02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:33.280
what's our we've got hearts this round it won't cost us an interest this is true

02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:40.720
uh could make our deck better let's see what we're looking at strength increase a rank

02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:49.920
a wild card a two planet cards maybe we maybe doubles money which is not good enough at the

02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:56.240
moment or a glass honestly i'm kind of like planet wild card wild card oh you want wild

02:08:56.240 --> 02:09:03.760
cards sorry okay wild card on queen plant or wild card wild card is consistency

02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:08.400
guaranteed joker proc wild or hermit i am all

02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:12.880
i'd say ace but it doesn't matter that much at the end of the day okay

02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:20.960
ace into a wild card okay and then we go next we're not doing that

02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:28.960
uh i'm definitely gonna invest in any planet cards that are for flushes because this is

02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:37.360
literally the only thing keeping us going right now we can skip for a 1.5 joker

02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:44.640
yeah i agree okay let's see what we're up against discard two random cards per hand

02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:48.000
ooh we can get a turret if we want right now

02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:57.520
we don't have a suit so not oh wow we have a four of a cane that's rare

02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:03.440
i don't like ever get that and then we'll just throw the the the six away

02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:11.120
what is your joker asking for hearts and that's only playing one heart so we can roll for more hearts

02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:16.960
i believe through you want me to play the ace leave the six

02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:27.680
we want to hunt a heart flush i mean that's only removing one heart if we do four of a kind

02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:36.240
60 times 7 times 1.5 times a little 1.5 here and it's 9k oh we're gonna make it

02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:45.120
wait if it's 9k can i destroy it i want to discard it like right now what did i get increase the

02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:54.080
rank curious 9k is a heart flush discard the ace yeah i've got increased the rank of cards i don't

02:10:54.080 --> 02:11:01.760
really know what to do with them hunt for hearts okay we will hunt for hearts bye bye bye bye bye bye

02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:12.160
bye bye bye i'd save strength for now save it get rid of you you and you even though the wild

02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:21.600
card can be used as any suit wait a minute is that a heart keep the ace oh he counts as a heart

02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:29.440
that's so cool i didn't realize that okay discard the rest one two three four five yeah he does

02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:35.920
register as a flush that's so cool okay off you pop

02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:48.960
11k for that that's so cool i hate to mean that bye bye bye right what did we get

02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:54.720
played face cards give multiplier wins scored okay we've got a little cute a bit too easy there

02:11:54.720 --> 02:12:04.000
okay we're diamonds a gold card a spectral pack smiley's pretty neat okay i'm gonna stick it what

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:12.320
we got what are we looking up next base edition has a free negative and a 1.5 oh i think we're

02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:19.600
skipping i kind of want to skip because that's 10 000 start with zero discord oh that completely

02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:29.600
destroys what we want to do don't double skip i don't think we can we don't even have we don't

02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:39.760
have consistency no what do you do you increase rank then we want to buy a spectral grab the

02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:47.280
spectral it might help out in our time of need what's this destroy one random card in your hand

02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:54.000
and get two enhanced aces create two copies of one selected card in your hand

02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:08.240
ace two copies two copies of a face card do the a cryptic ace so call in the queen or the ace

02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:16.240
yeah ace okay okay oh and he went up to two because of that okay okay he's now times two we're

02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:23.200
getting there now are we better spending to try and protect ourselves from what's coming up we

02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:29.120
have the water start with zero discards that is rough now i do want to skip for this negative

02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:34.720
joker it allows us an extra slot however i do want to play this one and go to the shop and

02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:41.360
see what we can buy to help us skip the first buy devil to be honest i'd say for the shop after

02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:53.360
the big plane devil is minus two minus one but three bucks says if a hand is held and i'm not

02:13:53.360 --> 02:14:01.920
really fussed for that do we want to do the arena is the question devil is neutral

02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:07.440
do we want a specific hidden turret

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:16.240
now you see skip right next round right next round next round next round i'll hold on to my two

02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:22.160
dollars interest for this play right we're gonna skip for the negative joker but we are gonna play

02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:31.840
why are you constantly prompting me just oh well i ain't gonna complain did we want to increase the

02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:38.400
rank of two selected cards by one are we wanting to use that what suit does the joker want oh he

02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:44.000
wants diamonds whoops he wants diamonds okay i'll throw for diamonds well we don't need to draw it

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:50.640
to be money neutral joker wants diamonds yes okay so we are gonna throw unfortunately it was nice

02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:58.000
having you while you were here but goodbye we want diamonds oh come on give us diamonds bro

02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:05.200
the second joker to the right the second joker to the right

02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:09.520
move smiley to the left

02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:16.960
if you're going to discard five you might as well play the hand oh

02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:27.920
oh sorry what did i get for a neutral oh that's 6k for that that was me bad oh what's going on

02:15:30.800 --> 02:15:32.240
the game's actually trolling

02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:41.440
oh come on as if we're not gonna pull a heart now we have one more discard

02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:45.760
this is rubbish

02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:53.600
i could upgrade what i don't know

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:08.800
wait wait wait what can i do i could make these are nine to give us a what queen

02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:20.800
jack ten nine i need a seven though no no just do it on one card i can artificially create a

02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:28.960
strength queen jack ten nine eight surely this is how the good lord intended it

02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:36.480
is this what is this am i throwing no i'm not because we only need one round

02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:41.920
okay okay sorry we only needed one i overthought that a little bit my apologies but we did what we

02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:54.400
did cash out okay negative jokers and 80 chips if it's got a pair okay consumable slot i'm not

02:16:54.400 --> 02:17:01.760
really bothered about choose one of up to four joker cards and choose one of up to three playing

02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:09.840
cards maybe the playing cards one um i mean we definitely could have had a better joker to hit

02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:14.560
yeah but i mean we got an extra joker slot and we get a lot of bonus for pairs if we want

02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:25.360
standard pack because it will upgrade hologram okay oh what are you you're so shiny hold on i'm

02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:31.920
taking a little hydration please hydrate a little briefly splurge a little because you get no discounts

02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:39.600
next round isn't the thing a permanent discount take the holographic four is good okay nice and

02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:45.680
simple we'll take four yeah and now he's 2.25 okay okay we'll we'll need to keep an eye on

02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:53.520
hologram he might be coming in clutch uh right we are now clubs ahoy i repeat we are now we could

02:17:53.520 --> 02:18:04.560
get a joker but we take as below the uh interest take the buffoon okay okay let's see what jokers

02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:12.640
in stock come on oh right create a turret if you're poor earn two bucks if you don't use this card so

02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:20.960
that's no good 100 chips if you play three of a kind and uh flush we're playing flushes

02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:29.200
yeah we're playing flushes aren't we yeah yeah okay let's put you somewhere over here

02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:37.440
put you there put you somewhere over here and we still have room at the end for a cheeky

02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:45.840
what are we looking at feed it upcoming okay start with zero discards this is going to be curious

02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:54.240
but you never know i'm sure this will go fine we have to win three hands go for flushes okay

02:18:55.520 --> 02:19:00.080
i can do it 10 000 no discards by the way

02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:10.800
so i can throw out a pair and hope to get a flush back i'll speak oh wait no hold on sorry

02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:15.040
sorry sorry sorry sorry clubs pause we need clubs

02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:25.920
oh you got a flush oh do i this is a wild card play it into that even though it doesn't play into

02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:31.600
him i mean let's see how much money we get for spades flush

02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:41.760
oh wow oh okay well that wild card i did not realize wild cards were that good

02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:46.720
i take back everything i have ever said about wild cards even though i've said nothing about

02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:53.920
them add double the rank of the lowest card no and no it's a suit so it prox everything that's

02:19:53.920 --> 02:20:01.600
fantastic okay i assume standard is going to upgrade our lovely hologram so let's get a

02:20:01.600 --> 02:20:07.120
little invest in my gating what's inside uh we have a wild card

02:20:09.840 --> 02:20:15.760
very valuable i'm tempted to pick up the wild card yeah i agree i agree wild card and then

02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:22.080
he's levelled up again he's now 2.5 no i'm interested to see if we could get a flush

02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:29.200
celestial pack am i allowed to do it it's not going to take off our economy our interest

02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:35.920

02:27:05.840 --> 02:27:15.040
we have increased the rank enhances two selected cards have bonus clubs gives the total sell value

02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:21.360
of all the jokers currently 17 bucks so 17 bucks i don't want that either so full no

02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:25.680
temperance easy money i am inclined to believe

02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:33.280
temperance yep okay we've got we've just raised our economy artificially i'm very happy we will go

02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:40.000
next i may not be able to talk all the time but i'm always here oh don't worry you can always

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:48.480
lurk if you're busy and stuff i know some of you listen at work i'm on to you oh my gosh are we

02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:53.120
going to do it in one i'm not going to play the four on purpose because it's a wild card and i can

02:27:53.120 --> 02:27:58.480
play it on anything i think we've done it in one though boop

02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:11.920
oh my god brah 159 for that that's so good and we got 12 bucks feels good man

02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:22.640
oh we got blueprint hold on you sound good right um plus 17 a booster or blueprint get

02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:28.800
blueprint okay unanimously we are getting blueprint right incompatible that's fine joker on the right

02:28:28.800 --> 02:28:41.360
so what him i put blueprint to copy ancient joker i mean i'm here for it i think you're

02:28:41.360 --> 02:28:47.520
giving me a wild card pt i'm so sorry yeah well we won okay i hope so right and then standard pack

02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:56.880
again to level up um hologram he'll be times three uh he'll be times three which is pretty good both

02:28:56.880 --> 02:29:03.360
packs mummy okay recline thank you for your help i know i might be frustrating to watch but thank you

02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:09.200
for your patience when you watch me play games because i'm not very smart um but i feel very

02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:15.120
accepted even though i am a dumb dumb so thank you okay back to the game i don't want to get too

02:29:15.120 --> 02:29:20.240
emotional because i feel very accepted as a stream when i'm dumb dumb but yes i take this

02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:25.760
okay and then uh you want me to check out the joker pack i feel like all our jokers are pretty

02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:31.840
good unless like crafty joker can probably get swapped out for something else do you want me to

02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:39.840
pick up jumbo i wouldn't check out just save for economy for a good role let's see what we're up

02:29:39.840 --> 02:29:46.640
against what are we up against gives a copy of the next selected tag and then three plus lose a dollar

02:29:46.640 --> 02:29:56.640
per hand plate that's fine right now economy doesn't matter it puts us a negative one okay let's just

02:29:56.640 --> 02:30:02.080
go next then i think we're i think we're doing okay we're going to see what a blueprint and ancient

02:30:02.080 --> 02:30:07.520
do together i think we have a good joker set i think it's fair to move on okay let's move on let's

02:30:07.520 --> 02:30:12.320
just keep our our money's to ourselves right what are we looking at here what would you like

02:30:12.320 --> 02:30:23.360
you would like hearts that is okay i am going to play uh the full house just to get rid of these

02:30:23.360 --> 02:30:27.920
cards and out the way and then we will roll for hearts okay but we will get a little cheeky

02:30:27.920 --> 02:30:34.800
a little cheeky dollar we do for this as well yeah and i think that is the correct play the

02:30:34.800 --> 02:30:45.280
correct choice oh well we didn't need it but we got money though oh what are you earn a dollar

02:30:45.280 --> 02:30:53.520
for each nine in your deck at the current round uh you know i'll take it right put a little hi cat

02:30:53.520 --> 02:31:02.400
no uh i don't think we need anything and less cloud nine eat earn a dollar it says plus 10 multi

02:31:02.400 --> 02:31:07.680
which is doing more than the crafty joker i'm tempted to sell crafty joker what do we think

02:31:07.680 --> 02:31:14.640
sell crafty joker to get a little plus 10 multiplier you can hover over the left most joker

02:31:15.280 --> 02:31:24.800
hovering although nine is money but what would we do the left you want blue joker gone

02:31:25.520 --> 02:31:29.920
two plus chips for each remaining card in the deck i feel like blue joker does more than

02:31:29.920 --> 02:31:34.720
what crafty joker wait no you're a flush i'm an idiot i thought that was pears for some reason

02:31:35.680 --> 02:31:38.720
sorry i'm sorry if we want to keep playing lose the blue

02:31:40.160 --> 02:31:46.560
okay we'll lose the blue oh okay maybe wait

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:55.120
i don't really need the money is the 10 plus multiplier i'm more interested in i feel like

02:31:55.120 --> 02:32:02.080
that's doing more than chips is it not accidental overkill honestly

02:32:05.680 --> 02:32:10.640
he's foil but cloud nine scales are multi better 10 plus multi doesn't matter

02:32:11.920 --> 02:32:15.840
the amount of chips ain't worth it just leave it while i just leave it as it is right i'm gonna

02:32:15.840 --> 02:32:20.960
open up my little celestial pack whilst we all have a discussion oh come on give me a flush

02:32:21.840 --> 02:32:27.440
this game does not like me right now i mean i guess give us two pears as a

02:32:29.120 --> 02:32:36.960
default right let's see what tarot's got in store for us hmm bonus cards hearts or select two

02:32:36.960 --> 02:32:41.840
cards convert the left into the right this one into the left into the right

02:32:41.840 --> 02:32:51.760
who has got the most cards clubs i could honestly probably get rid of a club

02:32:54.240 --> 02:33:03.600
death death a two into an ace or you shoulda we don't need that much flat multi you want the

02:33:03.600 --> 02:33:13.200
suits to be equal okay okay the base from our flush level and the ancient jokers all we need

02:33:13.200 --> 02:33:22.400
okay so what do you do select two cards and convert the left into the right sure yay we go to aces

02:33:22.400 --> 02:33:28.880
why not uh right we're gonna just get cloud nine i'm just gonna leave everything as is you guys are

02:33:28.880 --> 02:33:34.320
saying we're we're good to go so i very much convert one into a bonus like i thought we were

02:33:34.320 --> 02:33:44.320
going to do that but yeah you have too many clubs out right we are doing spades any spades

02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:53.920
spades spades spades we love to see it unfortunately we do not have a natural you went to densi

02:33:53.920 --> 02:33:59.200
i think the blue is worse than the nine but we'll we can probably come across something else

02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:05.040
just throw away i mean just makes all discard at all and do speed run yes

02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:12.640
we have a wild card so we will just play it on

02:34:13.520 --> 02:34:22.560
mount i know it's not the flush we want but it's not the flush we want but let's play it

02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:31.520
and we get a little penny on top 130 000 we got a penny we we got extra money we got 11 for that

02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:39.200
what are you a steel card or spades i think our spades are really fine it's really thinking what

02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:46.240
we don't like uh we could do a steel card i mean don't really see why not choose two the playing

02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:51.440
cards to add okay so that's gonna level him up spade flush would cost us the clean money

02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:54.640
who cares at this point actually yeah you're kind of right i feel like we've got enough

02:34:54.640 --> 02:35:01.040
economy going on what are you you have a chance one in five chance for a plus 20

02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:07.680
ah the queen money was better lucky money yeah take lucky money okay i'll take

02:35:08.720 --> 02:35:16.000
zui 69 oh you stop oh can i take them both oh no it's like okay and then a nine

02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:21.680
take this okay so now he's 3.5 and then he's what about to be four

02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:29.280
we have a jack multi and a queen i assume is the the dream team

02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:37.840
i'm going for it if it's wrong you may hang draw and quarter me okay and then i'll buy the steel

02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:44.320
and i'll hold on to the steel and we don't really need a consumable slot to be honest

02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:51.920
uh jack of clubs and money queen money right what are we up against is the question

02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:55.920
upcoming lose a dollar every hand plays

02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:05.760
i see a wild wild card what would you like you would like diamonds you most certainly can have

02:36:05.760 --> 02:36:11.760
diamonds so i am going to purposely get rid of you to give us a turret and we are going to roll

02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:20.640
for diamonds discard we've got the hermit doubles money i mean she i'll take it right

02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:24.800
diamonds one two three four five let's go

02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:39.360
that's that's silly that's silly one million for that hand that is so silly

02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:47.600
it gives the total sell value so what spend two dollars to make 18

02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:56.160
oh this is getting so silly i'm here for it right sure let's see what's in the standard pack

02:36:57.600 --> 02:37:04.080
what are we looking at money or money right who is the weakest diamond oh

02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:08.480
hearts is actually getting pretty far behind i might be better off playing him

02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:14.640
yeah i think we're gonna have to try and even out our hearts a bit more and then let's see turret

02:37:14.640 --> 02:37:27.360
what's going on over here bonus cards an exchange or a wild card okay i want to make a wild card on

02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:39.360
hearts a heart's wild card i'm going for wild wild card since we need to keep so wild the ace yeah

02:37:41.040 --> 02:37:50.960
wild card uh the wild card the ace which is a diamond yeah sure wild is why not wild are good

02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:56.400
yes i would like a lot of well oh i got a joker unlocked oh you can't see it my hair is in the

02:37:56.400 --> 02:38:02.720
way oh i'm so big my greed says money seems coffee but wild is good no oh did i mess up

02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:09.920
i could have done that seal card while i was there but anyway you smeared unlocked you smeared

02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:19.600
unlocked is the name of the card we could re-ros re-ros re-roll the blind what is an extra large

02:38:19.600 --> 02:38:24.960
blind well considering we make that in one go i'm not really worried i think we actually have won

02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:31.040
this one feels good man okay we're just gonna play i'm quite happy with what we've got if you are

02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:37.360
do you want me to re-roll maybe we should re-roll and try and get i recognize that joker

02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:44.480
anywhere it's so good for flush bills yeah okay what we're looking at bonus cards sure i don't

02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:49.440
i don't see why not oh we've got Fibonacci long time no see Fibonacci unfortunately no we're not

02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:56.080
using you but um you're a very good card in general take the last joker okay all cards are

02:38:56.080 --> 02:39:02.640
considered faces sorry caps don't worry i'm excited too i'm just excited as you are to play this game

02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:07.600
i don't sound it because i was raging earlier but i'm having a good time not worth it

02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:18.560
Fibonacci Fibonacci lose the blue joker for it okay it's blue joker we will say thank you

02:39:19.280 --> 02:39:28.560
all face cards work with smiley oh okay wait played face cards give five plus

02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:37.200
but if it considers all cards are considered a face so smiley in parodolia not the blue joker sorry

02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:46.800
these aren't good enough to swap out yet we have better chip sources than four joker that is blue

02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:52.000
no blue prints too it will be when i get rid of blue print

02:39:55.680 --> 02:40:01.440
they'll leave it that just leave it i mean we're winning we're literally doing like 100 a pot right

02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:06.640
sorry we're doing 100 a pot we're more than fine i know i don't need that right next next next

02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:13.040
i think we're doing fine we're doing fine i'm i'm not too worried right you would like clubs

02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:22.400
we have two clubs and no more uh right so what get rid of all this we don't have a wild card

02:40:26.720 --> 02:40:29.440
oh this is what i'm worried about when the game starts doing this to me

02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:40.960
oh i don't like when the game does this to me you want clubs i have two clubs and no more

02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:46.240
so i just keep throwing them away keep the queen we have to continue dig dig dig i'm digging a hole

02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:52.320
i know but we'll have two discards left let's just keep fishing okay discard diamond queen and keep

02:40:52.320 --> 02:41:03.200
digging discard diamond queen oh i really don't like the way this is shaping two is enough wait

02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:10.480
what do you need me to do i'm sure confusion what do you do you make a steel card all the red cards

02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:17.680
out bing bong boom oh yeah we're not gonna okay diamonds and hearts are out they wait what do you

02:41:17.680 --> 02:41:22.560
want you want a club okay diamonds and hearts are out because uh they hardly are gonna come back

02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:28.880
into rotation i'm sorry if i did the wrong move but i have one discard left this is exactly what i

02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:38.640
didn't want to happen and it happened look how many spades are sitting in the deck 17 spades are

02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:46.240
lurking in the shadows okay the odds of us not rolling is astronomical this has to work

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:54.480
this game has nothing but the audacity are you serious

02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:04.640
16 spades sitting hiding in that deck and i have to play a fishy two appears

02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:15.920
we have a full house play the trash i know you guys are saying full house but if we do a club we

02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:26.320
win we do a club flush we win mommy you'll get 10k tomorrow really i've not been uploading any ace

02:42:26.320 --> 02:42:32.240
smart though how i don't know how i'm getting traction i don't know i don't know if the full

02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:43.840
house will be enough ace ace 4 4 4 no that's rub it sorry i uh i right let me just be bad we

02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:48.800
have three rounds we can play let me just be let me be transparent let me be bad at the game okay

02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:58.320
let me just submit that's what i want okay one two three four five i want to know

02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:03.840
yeah you're gaining traction by being a cutey

02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:11.360
oh right one two three four five yeah flush yeah

02:43:17.600 --> 02:43:29.840
oh my god 4.7 million no that's my highest ever hit 4.7 million

02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:45.680
no way that's fantastic oh my gosh oh my gosh golly oh my gosh golly that's sorry that's so cool

02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:49.520
choose a tarot card right we're gonna start using these

02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:57.200
uh a steel card let's just shove it on anything i guess right there's less

02:43:57.760 --> 02:44:00.800
uh the hearts and the spades have actually evened up what do you want next you want a

02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:06.240
spade of course you want the the smallest one right bonus cards ace and a king become a bonus

02:44:06.240 --> 02:44:12.560
focus focus you are a bonus that's fine uh chariot steel card what do we put the steel on

02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:20.240
flushes really are okay great cards but hard to find it hold chariot for an emergency understood

02:44:20.320 --> 02:44:28.560
right we have planets luck enhancing to two lucky cards i wouldn't mind luck luck is kind of fun

02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:35.440
diamond we've already got enough diamonds on the deck mommy is our biggest hitter ever

02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:39.920
but you're winning so hard you could just be one harder okay let's do luck forget if we roll a lucky

02:44:39.920 --> 02:44:47.600
card i'm like although i'm here for it not steel glass that's not glass like steel

02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:55.280
just use luck or we could roll for planet but we might not get anything we want that's the problem

02:44:55.280 --> 02:45:06.080
with planet just do luck okay let's do come back okay and then re-roll three of a kind we don't need

02:45:06.080 --> 02:45:14.320
three of a kind we don't need one in four chance no one more re-roll one plus hand size honestly

02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:25.200
all flushes and streets can be made with four car reeflings reeflings is this the card we want

02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:35.520
is this the card we won yes you want it we want it we don't need it we always get the flush

02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:38.240
well only because we're throwing so much as such a way

02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:43.120
follow your heart scrawny i feel like

02:45:45.280 --> 02:45:47.440
um what would we trade for it though

02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:57.040
i think crafty joker he only gives 80 plus chips you he gives more chips blue joker gives more

02:45:57.040 --> 02:46:03.040
than crafty four card flushes also don't score as well not that you need to believe in the heart of

02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:07.040
car

02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:13.440
blue joker makes probably makes more than crafty crafty or blue doesn't matter both are shite

02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:21.680
sell crafty okay thank you crafty you have been fantastic wait what am i being an idiot

02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:29.600
all flushes and streets can be made with four cards let's see what are gonna happen because

02:46:29.600 --> 02:46:36.320
that's very unique um okay next round what are you

02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:45.600
okay what would you like you would like space you'll never guess i've rolled one space so if i

02:46:45.600 --> 02:46:53.360
play oh i don't really want to play that what get rid of them because i don't want this is a 1.5 if

02:46:53.360 --> 02:47:01.280
it stays in my hand can you show your deck all yours baby the four only gives you consistent

02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:04.880
it could be a lifesaver ditch all but the seal

02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:14.080
and queen yes agreed east guard we'll go for a diamond flush even though it's not exactly what

02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:23.520
we want but so that work see it counts as a flush so what happens if i play a four only flush

02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:36.800
oh it didn't like that it didn't like that um curious i'll keep that in mind it didn't like it

02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:43.440
but it could save us in a in a very rough time oh well okay we should just go for the flush of

02:47:43.440 --> 02:47:51.280
whatever card it's asking for that is insane retrigger each blade multi multi well we might be

02:47:51.280 --> 02:47:58.080
able to get uh was it jupiter three of a kind two pair four of a kind this game really does not like

02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:04.480
me i got a sport 5k well off which is pretty strong to be the suit with that ancient joker yeah

02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:12.800
yeah oh just grab any old thing and then another one just because we can flush

02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:20.160
wow black holes hidden in here but we play flushes because they're all the same colors

02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:25.600
so we flush it down the toilet that's right that's how i remember what flushes oh no you guys are

02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:39.040
saying black hole oh i'm sorry i'm sorry i got so focused on the thing that's fine we're doing

02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:45.680
flushes anyway okay extra large veins let's go what would you like you would like diamonds today

02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:53.120
oh you'll never guess what card i didn't pull some of the fucking diamonds i think just

02:48:54.400 --> 02:49:03.280
what throw everything for diamonds wait no hold on what am i doing there's already a suit in here

02:49:03.280 --> 02:49:12.640
should i just play the suit i still have three hands anyway club flush yeah i feel like we have

02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:19.040
enough rounds for it i know i can get a turret if i discard him but me oh no destroy the ace okay

02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:26.240
i'll destroy this discard the ace and these and see what happens when did i get temperance

02:49:26.240 --> 02:49:34.640
gives me money okay this is what i didn't want we are getting the diamonds but yeah now we're up

02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:35.360
Greek

02:49:40.720 --> 02:49:46.800
nine how do you spot that that's insane what did you spot nine nine nine

02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:58.000
queen and five player throw a player discard i don't know any of these words just enjoy the

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:04.400
accent let it let it flow through you how to see clubs in a scotch accent clubs discard them

02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:16.480
could make some dosh i don't know but play them okay fuck it up now if we don't roll diamond

02:50:16.480 --> 02:50:21.680
yeah i was gonna say this game's target and this one two three four five just a double check diamond

02:50:21.680 --> 02:50:28.560
let's go let's go leave it to me i see someone's got real addicted to this game it's such a good

02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:36.880
game i love it oh my god two million are you joking we made two million on that that's ridiculous

02:50:39.440 --> 02:50:44.800
it does nothing no redeem it please i want it i've still not unlocked what's inside that

02:50:45.360 --> 02:50:51.280
sure give us money 86 bucks planets let's see what you got for me give me jipper

02:50:51.280 --> 02:50:59.520
flush that's exactly what we want yes wait cells are for eight she redeemed literally all that

02:50:59.520 --> 02:51:07.760
frustration and then it paid off oh fancy right what are we looking at we have we need a heart

02:51:07.760 --> 02:51:14.400
or a spade to start even and stuff up so i guess a spade ten plus money creates a planet card for

02:51:14.400 --> 02:51:23.680
final if it's hell sure oh you want you want spade you want spade two viewers are streaming their

02:51:23.680 --> 02:51:32.160
addiction right now sad that they fell that i love that ace diamond ace diamond for the target cards

02:51:33.040 --> 02:51:39.440
we don't have a flat multi either ace is fine i was gonna do the spade to try and even up because

02:51:40.240 --> 02:51:46.240
uh spades are 14 in the hand which is a bit hard if the multiplier asks for it

02:51:46.240 --> 02:51:55.680
it's last ante ace spade yeah we're at 4.5 um we trigger all cards for the next ten hands

02:51:55.680 --> 02:52:03.040
well i don't have room for you but re-roll weren't you when blind is selected destroy joker to the

02:52:03.120 --> 02:52:11.520
right and permanently double its value yeah re-roll none of these are good one more re-roll boom

02:52:12.880 --> 02:52:20.640
judgment creates a random joker bonus card why not why not each played king of diamonds gives

02:52:22.640 --> 02:52:25.520
keep rolling is this the last round i'm not going crazy

02:52:25.520 --> 02:52:35.840
oh very large blind 300 we are we make that in one go i'm not sure i'm nervous for this one

02:52:36.400 --> 02:52:41.280
well i just sell everything so long as we stay over 25 bucks it doesn't matter okay one more

02:52:42.480 --> 02:52:52.400
four of a kind no discarded no right one more i'll come on oh flush very lucky fushy

02:52:53.360 --> 02:53:04.240
okay well one more and no 29 and then four bucks some more we're to spend on okay wild cat oh

02:53:06.080 --> 02:53:13.280
uh okay well you okay it's fine it's fine it's fine if we have four spare yeah okay what would you

02:53:13.280 --> 02:53:19.280
like you would like hearts cards you are more than welcome to have hearts cards uh i just need to

02:53:19.280 --> 02:53:30.000
discard for them because yeah these are all terrible actually lose chariot for wild carry

02:53:30.560 --> 02:53:39.120
um as does the bonus card permanent effect work yeah i'll just make space okay um right if you

02:53:39.120 --> 02:53:49.600
want hearts i will get rid of everything for you my lady um discard everything yeah i'm with you

02:53:49.600 --> 02:53:57.600
there wow game tell me that you don't like me it's fine hearts one two three four five discard

02:53:58.560 --> 02:54:02.800
there we go one two three four five go

02:54:09.760 --> 02:54:16.640
oh my god okay i'm not worried about winning this one i'm gonna be honest i think we won on this deck

02:54:16.640 --> 02:54:23.520
finally won on this deck what are you a joker gains four chips okay let's see what's in the packs

02:54:24.320 --> 02:54:30.720
unfortunately not what we want to just shove on anything straight flush because the four

02:54:30.720 --> 02:54:34.800
jokers honestly it's funny because it was a straight flush because you only needed four oh

02:54:34.800 --> 02:54:43.920
oops i forgot how many we've got 14 we need another hearts and all honesty but i mean it's all right

02:54:44.720 --> 02:54:51.600
we can just take it i'm not really too worried now that we have the other thing um now one more

02:54:51.680 --> 02:55:01.680
re-roll urinus no no you stinky three clubs straight flush gosh this game doesn't like me

02:55:02.400 --> 02:55:09.760
all right one more round before the boss you would like the clubs i most certainly can arrange

02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:16.800
that for you i have a wild card right you you you you and you out you're all clubs you're a wild card

02:55:16.800 --> 02:55:19.600
discard

02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:22.080
just say you hate me

02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:31.840
ooh you you you you gone because we technically have a flush with a diamond with a club here

02:55:32.960 --> 02:55:41.920
go away so you you you you are a flush create a planet card for final played poker hand of

02:55:41.920 --> 02:55:55.840

were you a wild card a hearts or tarot we'll just shove it on a wild card i don't see why not

02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:27.280
everything wild cards are so valuable for how we're doing this give us black hole because i messed

up add a gold seal destroy one and get to enhance now add a gold seal to one card sure

02:58:45.840 --> 02:58:52.240
i get have at least three wild cards in your deck hearts and diamonds count as the same suit
