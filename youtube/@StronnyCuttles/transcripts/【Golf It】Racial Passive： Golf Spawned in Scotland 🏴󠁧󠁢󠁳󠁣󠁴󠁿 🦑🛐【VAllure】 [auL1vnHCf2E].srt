1
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:29,280
The gaming screen, go to the gaming screen.

2
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:38,160
We avoided the curse of the streamers and actually booted up the game.

3
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
We wanted to.

4
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
Christmas.

5
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
Can I get a round of applause?

6
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
Round of applause, everyone.

7
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
It actually worked.

8
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,160
It actually worked.

9
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
How is everyone sound?

10
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
Hello.

11
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,160
Hello.

12
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Hello.

13
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
Hello.

14
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

15
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
No scoffers.

16
00:07:51,160 --> 00:08:01,160
Yes, some of the girls.

17
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,160
I think it was a volume good.

18
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
Oh my god.

19
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
I have volume.

20
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
Oh my god.

21
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
Oh my god.

22
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
Why are you almost 50?

23
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
I had to turn you down.

24
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
Oh my god.

25
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:20,160
I had to turn you down.

26
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Holy finally done it.

27
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
Wait for who donated that.

28
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
It's anonymous.

29
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
Anonymous.

30
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,160
100.

31
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,160
I'm tweaking.

32
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
I'm tweaking.

33
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Thank you.

34
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
We love anonymous.

35
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
Anonymous.

36
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,160
Anonymous.

37
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
Anonymous.

38
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:42,160
Okay, should I start the game?

39
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,160
Does anyone want?

40
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
Do you want more strokes?

41
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,160
Do you want more?

42
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
I would love more strokes.

43
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,160
You don't have to ask us twice.

44
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Who wants to stroke?

45
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
I always go overboard.

46
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
Wait, we'll try the collision.

47
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
Yeah.

48
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
The collision will be funny.

49
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
What is collision?

50
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
Wait, what is collision?

51
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
We can hit each other.

52
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
Our balls touch.

53
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
Oh my god.

54
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
Our balls touch.

55
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
Did you guys customize your balls?

56
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,160
No.

57
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
No?

58
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
How do you do that?

59
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
We can hit each other.

60
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
We can hit each other's balls.

61
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
We can hit each other's balls.

62
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
Oh my god.

63
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,160
Did you guys customize your balls?

64
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
No.

65
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,160
No?

66
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
How do you do that?

67
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
How do I customize my balls?

68
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,160
I can customize my balls?

69
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
Oh, two seconds.

70
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
Top left.

71
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,160
Top left.

72
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,160
You guys didn't customize your balls?

73
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,160
Top left seconds.

74
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
Oh my god.

75
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
I can customize my balls.

76
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Thank you.

77
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
Give me a second.

78
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
What's SIDUM?

79
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
SDMN?

80
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
Is it another option?

81
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
I thought you said SDD.

82
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160
No.

83
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,160
It's in top left, customized ball.

84
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,160
And a foot SDMN on SIDUM.

85
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
Oh.

86
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,160
I have a flaming hot ball.

87
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,160
Now my ball has hearts.

88
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,160
How do you customize your balls?

89
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,160
There's one with X's in me.

90
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
There is?

91
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
Where?

92
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
Oh, I see it.

93
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,160
Yeah, I customize my ball.

94
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,160
How do you do that?

95
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,160
Left.

96
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Everyone's so excited to have their own custom ball.

97
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
Oh my god.

98
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
That's amazing.

99
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
Beautiful.

100
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,160
Let me know when you're done customizing your balls.

101
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,160
I'm almost done.

102
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,160
I've customized.

103
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,160
Do I need to, like, radio?

104
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,160
Oh, I need to put a hat on your ball.

105
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
Am I ready?

106
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,160
I can't tell if I'm ready or if I'm not ready.

107
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,160
It turns green or yellow is ready.

108
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,160
Green.

109
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,160
Green is ready.

110
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
Oh, OK.

111
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
I'm ready.

112
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
I'm ready.

113
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Are you ready?

114
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,160
Yeah.

115
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,160
I don't think she is.

116
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,160
Yeah.

117
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,160
Well, oh, not every player is ready.

118
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,160
Not every player is ready.

119
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
I'm ready.

120
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
No.

121
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,160
I'm going to press the button.

122
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Yeah.

123
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
Hell yeah.

124
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
Hell yeah.

125
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
We're in.

126
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,160
Oh my god.

127
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
Oh no.

128
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
We're in.

129
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
How do we play?

130
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
How do we play?

131
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
How do we play?

132
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
How do we play?

133
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Aim, click, and tap.

134
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
What's happening?

135
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
Wait, what happened?

136
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
How do I do this?

137
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
Hello?

138
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
It's just so weird.

139
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,160
Oh, so weird.

140
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,160
What the fuck am I doing?

141
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
Wait, I don't know how to do it either.

142
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,160
Aim, click, and then pop the string.

143
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,160
Oh no.

144
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Click and drag.

145
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
Oh yeah.

146
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Drag.

147
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
I don't know.

148
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Just to say.

149
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
This is so cute.

150
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,160
Azura will say thank you once the collabs over.

151
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,160
But thank you everyone who's supporting Azura.

152
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
We really appreciate it.

153
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
We love you.

154
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Ignore me.

155
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,160
I think I know it's like a long road.

156
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,160
You're notification broke.

157
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Can it not keep up?

158
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,160
Oh my God.

159
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
I think it's broken.

160
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
What broke?

161
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
That was trash.

162
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,160
No way.

163
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,160
How did you get it?

164
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,160
It's broken.

165
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,160
Oh, come on.

166
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
That was trash.

167
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
No way.

168
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
How did you get it?

169
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
It's broken.

170
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
It's broken.

171
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,160
Oh, come on.

172
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
It's broken.

173
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,160
Fuck get me off the fucking thing.

174
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,160
Hello.

175
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,160
Oh my God.

176
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,160
I'm still struggling to figure out how to play right now.

177
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
Oh, boogie.

178
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,160
You got this little sis.

179
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,160
There you go.

180
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,160
You're getting so kind of weird.

181
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,160
No, not the double boogie.

182
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,160
The double what?

183
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,160
The boogie.

184
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,160
The boogie of course.

185
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,160
The double boogie.

186
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,160
I thought it was boogie.

187
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,160
It's boogie.

188
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,160
Where's the hole?

189
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,160
Oh, it's my ass.

190
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,160
Oh shit.

191
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,160
Oh my God.

192
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,160
Wait, I want a hole in one.

193
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,160
I'm scared.

194
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,160
I hit it against the wall.

195
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
Damn, I got a hole in one.

196
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
Let's go.

197
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,160
Oh.

198
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,160
I thought I was going to be the only one that didn't get it and I was going to cry.

199
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
Everyone's anonymous.

200
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
Fuck.

201
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
Wait, all the donations are anonymous or?

202
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
Yeah.

203
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,160
Thank you, Anon, Anon, Anon, Anon, Anon, Anon.

204
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,160
Anon, Anon, Anon, Anon.

205
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,160
We love kissing too.

206
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
Anon, I'm trying to learn how to do this.

207
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,160
This is hard.

208
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,160
It is.

209
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Fuck.

210
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,160
I'm hard.

211
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,160
Oh no man.

212
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
Oh, do you have?

213
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,160
I think Mercy has love hearts coming off of her.

214
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,160
No, I didn't mean to do that.

215
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,160
This is so bad.

216
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,160
There we go.

217
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,160
I am terrible at this, please.

218
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,160
I get it.

219
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Triple boogie, that's fine.

220
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,160
We got this, Mercy.

221
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,160
We didn't play a practice round, to be honest.

222
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,160
We're just going to blend.

223
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,160
We just went all seven strokes for different folks.

224
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
Exactly.

225
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
Bruh, how are we supposed to guess where the map is?

226
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
Where is the hole?

227
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
Oh shit.

228
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
Fuck.

229
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
Oh my god.

230
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,160
We love you 150.

231
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
Thank you, Mr. Anonymous.

232
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,160
Thank you, Mr. Anonymous.

233
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,160
Are you serious?

234
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,160
Oh frick.

235
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,160
I can't.

236
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,160
Oh frick.

237
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,160
It's really dark in this one.

238
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,160
I see, why are you on my backside right now?

239
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,160
I want to.

240
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
I do what I want.

241
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
I can't see.

242
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,160
I'll get the action shot, don't you get it?

243
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
Am I doing good at golf?

244
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
This is MLG Pro.

245
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,160
What a gamer.

246
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,160
Golf, golf, golf, golf.

247
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
No way.

248
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
Edging, edging, edging.

249
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Edging the rim, edging the rim.

250
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,160
I'm so mad.

251
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Oh my god.

252
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,160
Alright, here we go.

253
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
We got to do...

254
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
Don't do what, it didn't work.

255
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
It didn't work.

256
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,160
Where the fuck I am?

257
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
Come on, come on.

258
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
Where the fuck I am?

259
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
I'm in a hole.

260
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
I missed the hole.

261
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
What the hell?

262
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
I'm still in the hole.

263
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
Where the fuck am I?

264
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
Why?

265
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,160
Are you kidding me?

266
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
Who was that?

267
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
It was Zara.

268
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
Fuck this shit.

269
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Me and Mercy are struggling over here.

270
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
I can tell.

271
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
I'm glad I'm finally not the one struggling in the game

272
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
for the first time in my life.

273
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
I'll take it.

274
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
Shut up.

275
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
Toxic golf.

276
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
Toxic golf.

277
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
Me and Mercy, we're fine on the bottom.

278
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
We'll lift everybody up.

279
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,160
I don't want to be on the bottom.

280
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,160
I want to be on top.

281
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
There.

282
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
Where's the hole?

283
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Wait, what? You can come off this map.

284
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,160
Can I jump?

285
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
I don't know.

286
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,160
You can come off this map.

287
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
Right, enough. That's three strokes.

288
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
I keep trolling.

289
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
Stop trolling.

290
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
Okay.

291
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Now we slowly...

292
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
Am I going to roll all the way back?

293
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
No.

294
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,160
What?

295
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,160
Stay, stay, stay.

296
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Right, I'm throwing.

297
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
You should be riddled.

298
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
I'm throwing so hard.

299
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,160
Guys, guys, what the hell is this?

300
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
We ain't going to make it...

301
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
I'm throwing.

302
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
I'm throwing.

303
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
I'm going to throw.

304
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
Ah, no. Ah, no.

305
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
I'm...

306
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
No!

307
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
I'm going to cry.

308
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
Where am I?

309
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
Hello?

310
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
No!

311
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
I killed AC.

312
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
I killed AC because her balls collided.

313
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
I'm creeping.

314
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,160
I'm on the edge of glory.

315
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
I'm on a living stroke.

316
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,160
Who picked the main shaft?

317
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
What am I doing?

318
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
Who picked the main shaft?

319
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
Isaac, the main shaft.

320
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
Of course.

321
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,160
Sorry.

322
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
Sorry, I have a salt.

323
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
I do.

324
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Wait.

325
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
Is there a maximum amount?

326
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
There has to be a maximum amount.

327
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
It's 12 strokes.

328
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Well, it can't be because I managed 17.

329
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
It's that one.

330
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
That's great.

331
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
I literally got a 17 stroke.

332
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
I guess it's not.

333
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Shortened behavior.

334
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,160
Shortened behavior.

335
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Almost all in one?

336
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,160
That was...

337
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
One minute.

338
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
I needed to even the plane field.

339
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
Let's do this.

340
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
Let's do this.

341
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
Come on.

342
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,160
I can't believe you, Mercy.

343
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
How could you swear?

344
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
That's so fucking stupid.

345
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
I got the trick shot.

346
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
Sorry, I said such bad words.

347
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,160
I will remember to...

348
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,160
Wait, how did you do that?

349
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,160
You're gonna f*** yourself?

350
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
I can't believe you're going to f*** yourself.

351
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
Oh my god.

352
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,160
This is so good.

353
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Are you winning?

354
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,160
What the f*** is the salt thing?

355
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
It's me.

356
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,160
I put salt on myself.

357
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
It's like an additional thing.

358
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
Because I'm salty.

359
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
There you go.

360
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
I'm Scottish.

361
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
Didn't you know golf started in Scotland?

362
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
I have a racial passive to this.

363
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
I'm not even kidding.

364
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Stop.

365
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
Please.

366
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
I may have thrown in that 17 round,

367
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
but I'm gonna bring it back.

368
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
I see it on the bottom.

369
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
Only one made up for all your 12 strokes.

370
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
Wait, what was that?

371
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
What was our map?

372
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
That was me having a mental breakdown.

373
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
Meet a real...

374
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
Let's go.

375
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Strony, get out of my face.

376
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Strony, help me up.

377
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
I love my breakdown.

378
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Let's go.

379
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
I was doing so good.

380
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
What the f***?

381
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
F***ing map.

382
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
F*** this.

383
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
Are you reaching over golf right now?

384
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
Yes.

385
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
Because I always f***ing suck at games.

386
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Give me a second.

387
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
Give me a second.

388
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
I got a spammer in chat.

389
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
What are they saying?

390
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,160
Monkey.

391
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,160
I'm gonna fart on him.

392
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
I'm gonna fart on him.

393
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
This one's for you, buddy.

394
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,160
Shipping on him.

395
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,160
Shipping and farting so hard.

396
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,160
Shipping on them hard.

397
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
I'm tired because

398
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,160
I blocked that.

399
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,160
Motherf***er.

400
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
They keep pulling back.

401
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,160
What? That was like a pro strat.

402
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,160
Hold on.

403
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
Where the f*** is this?

404
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,160
Where did the flag go?

405
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,160
I found it.

406
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,160
It's like through the yellow tunnels?

407
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
Oh, I found it.

408
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
I'm so mad.

409
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,160
That was gonna be A++.

410
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,160
Why do I have to be behind

411
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,160
whatever the f*** this is?

412
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,160
What does boogie mean?

413
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,160
Three?

414
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,160
I think boogie is three.

415
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,160
I'm being hit.

416
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,160
I'm gonna start choosing violence.

417
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,160
And I'm gonna start targeting others.

418
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,160
Oh, no!

419
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,160
Sabotage us.

420
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,160
Wait, they're moving.

421
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,160
The goal is moving.

422
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,160
How?

423
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,160
What the hell?

424
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,160
We need to pick the easy peasy levels.

425
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,160
What is this?

426
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,160
It's a funner.

427
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,160
Where am I?

428
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,160
There's no way we're supposed to

429
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,160
just eat ourselves on top.

430
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,160
Let's do a little bit of this.

431
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,160
Let's do a little bit of that.

432
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,160
And then...

433
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,160
Sorry.

434
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,160
Never mind.

435
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,160
Please.

436
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,160
Please, I'm begging.

437
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,160
Let me come a little bit closer.

438
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,160
I'm gonna do...

439
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
I got this.

440
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
I got this.

441
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,160
Bad timing.

442
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
It's okay.

443
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,160
We're still here.

444
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,160
Quick time event.

445
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,160
I don't think he's still alive.

446
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
I'm so easy.

447
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,160
I'm so hard.

448
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,160
I'm so close.

449
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,160
Wait, that actually almost helped me.

450
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Where am I?

451
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,160
Let me go.

452
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Let me go.

453
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Let me go first.

454
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
Let me go first.

455
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,160
What the hell was that?

456
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,160
Let me go first.

457
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
Let me go first.

458
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Let me go first.

459
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,160
Did someone get in the hole?

460
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Damn.

461
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,160
I'm throwing myself on the train tracks for real.

462
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,160
I'm about to end it all.

463
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,160
I'm about to end it all.

464
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Azura did it?

465
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,160
Azura got in the hole?

466
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,160
I'm gonna come a little bit closer.

467
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,160
No.

468
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,160
No, wait, how did I not get in the hole?

469
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
I was too early.

470
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,160
You got a mercy.

471
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
I was too early.

472
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,160
I got it.

473
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,160
I got it.

474
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,160
I got it.

475
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,160
Congratulations.

476
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,160
Thank you.

477
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,160
Thank you for the 25 Mr. Anonymous.

478
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,160
17?

479
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,160
Why did I get penalized 17?

480
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
No one else got penalized 17?

481
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Why do you say it like that?

482
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,160
Penalized?

483
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,160
How did you say it?

484
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,160
Penalized.

485
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,160
Where's the thing?

486
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,160
Oh, it's over there.

487
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,160
Alright, let's go.

488
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,160
Wait, how did you say penis

489
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,160
and how did you spell penalized?

490
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,160
P-E-N-I

491
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,160
P-N-A

492
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,160
P-N-A

493
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,160
Oh, shit.

494
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,160
I don't know how to spell. Don't listen to me.

495
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,160
Don't listen to me.

496
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,160
Where's the ball?

497
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,160
In the hole.

498
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,160
The fucking train!

499
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,160
What am I saying?

500
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,160
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

501
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,160
Wait, any of these is the goal?

502
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,160
I wish I could have this day

503
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,160
that I've never played this game before.

504
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,160
Please, Ronnie. How do you say pen?

505
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,160
Please.

506
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,160
Pen.

507
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,160
Pen.

508
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,160
Penalized.

509
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,160
Penalized.

510
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,160
Penalized.

511
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,160
Penalized.

512
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,160
Yeah, it's penalized.

513
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,160
I was in love with God.

514
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,160
He's so good.

515
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,160
He's my main chef.

516
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,160
He's in love with the Holy Goddess of Zerah.

517
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,160
That was far too hard.

518
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,160
I got a little...

519
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,160
Which one is the hole?

520
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,160
Are they all the holes?

521
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,160
Hole.

522
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,160
Oh, wait. The one with the flag.

523
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,160
Oh.

524
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,160
How am I supposed to...

525
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
Bonk.

526
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,160
I'm still at the fucking start.

527
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:03,480
Oh, yeah, I'm back in the fucking building relax. Oh, yeah, okay. I did it. I did it. I made it

528
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,720
I made that all right. Let's go

529
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,760
Now I just realized I forgot to turn off this

530
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,320
What what what you done?

531
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,160
What have you done?

532
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,880
Nothing, so they didn't do anything. Did you have your background music on?

533
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,720
Mine is I saw my background music on

534
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,120
Okay, all right, where is it?

535
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:42,240
I'm going this way. I'm following in me spanked it rather gently that time do apologize. Let's try that a bit harder

536
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,960
I'm on X games

537
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,360
I

538
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,600
Someone literally goes in my stream I switch streams just to say it's pen

00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,120

00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
You guys suck it

543
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,200

Birthday girl look clearly birthday girl. How do we get over to this one? Oh, I just

This is our comeuppance from making fun of the league player

547
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,560
What

548
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,080
Okay, that was a bit too high

549
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,960
I have to be back all the way over here

550
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,760
In me right now

They love attention

559
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:27,720
Mods that'd be great. I think it's everyone's mods are not used to this time. They're like asleep right now. They're like

774
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,800
I know it's nice to be on the the receiving end of her screams

775
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,360

Your tweet gave me a heart attack because it didn't display fully

01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:22,620
We're getting corralled like animals

1076
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:29,340
Don't you see the game has us pitched against each other but through the power of friendship and love we'll make it

1077
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:33,100
That's right

1078
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:38,300

1084
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:13,900

1085
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:15,740

01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:18,380

1089
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:33,820
I was there

1090
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:36,380
I was there. Mm. That's right. I was there

1091
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:47,100

Okay, that is working right someone else. Give me American history. Come on. Quick

1094
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:08,460
I don't think anyone would understand me if I started licking it on

1095
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:15,340
I don't think anybody wants to hear my new england accent. Go for it. Go for it. Go for it. Go for it

1096
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:18,060

01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,500
No, your homework. Why you no doctor?

1103
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:52,300
I mean she can do it. She's like to do it. Hold on. She's allowed to do it before anyone starts getting weird. She can do it

1104
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:54,460
She's a liar. She's allowed

1105
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:58,140
Kissing mercy

You didn't mean ASMR. I can't have it. Yeah, we're going to the donk anybody want anything from donk's kid. Yeah

1134
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,820

Someone named cps just tipped me and talking about how I killed my tomagotchi

1146
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:13,900
He hasn't forgiven you for your crimes against your tomagotchi

1147
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:16,620
I I've killed many a tomagotchi

Mercy

1161
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:28,860
Mercy jumped out by accident

1162
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:31,580
Mercy, why do you keep clicking quit?

1163
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:35,180
Because I'm stupid. She's so excited to be next

1164
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:42,060
I was also too excited. Uh, maybe I don't know. No, I miss so many. I miss so many

1165
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:46,860
Close your eyes

1166
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:52,060
It was like spamming like close your eyes. Go to bed something something in your head

Are you feeling it now? Mr. Mercy? Should I do?

1171
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,420
Uh

1172
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:11,420
What should I do? Should I do hard mode?

1173
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:13,340
Yes, see if there's one

1174
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:18,380
See if there's a map that looks like a zero and then we'll end on this one because we've almost uh

1175
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:24,140
If I think one more game is going to take us like 30 minutes and then Azura can get on with her business

1176
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:26,700
Because she's got a lot of things fun today

1177
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:30,940
I already chose a map by us. Okay. No, no, that's good

1178
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:32,940
It's bad

1179

Thank you. Grimmed by veal or I get strengths again with the 10 gifts

01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:43,500
You're gonna kill Icy with hard mode

1182
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:47,340
I'm sorry. I see for what I'm about to do

1183
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:52,060

1184
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:55,100

Oh, I can't wait. Oh, sorry. I forgot to hit ready

1186
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:02,300

It's supposed to be a jay temple. Oh, this is a weird jay temple

1192
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:23,660
There's turnips on the floor. What's with the random bar at the bottom? That was in here. What the fuck?

1193
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:26,380
No, my radishes

1194
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:29,180
How do you get on the thingy?

1195

Strony. Strony. Don't do it. Strony. I'm not gonna do it. That's a kiss

1196
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:39,260

1197
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:42,060
Damn

1198
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:48,780
Oh my gosh, I could have been honest. This is anyone's win because of how awkward this map is. This is literally anyone's win

1199
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:51,580
Is that a game?

1200
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:54,060
Why do I keep on getting back

1201
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:56,220

You know what? Since this is the last game. I choose violence

1205
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:09,420

They hate me

1213
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:31,580
Why am I in such a bad spot?

1214
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:37,020
Okay, this should be a little better. Amy. Amy, move first. Okay, where are you?

Okay, you can't land in the water. Fuck. Why is it doing this?

01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:13,980
But apparently all of them are pee, pee, poo, poo, and cuckoo

1401
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:15,980
Like keep it a stack

1402
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:17,980
Like brat, keep it a stack

1403
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:25,980
Oh my, no

1404
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:27,980
Someone taped in Azur's

1405
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:31,980
Someone taped in Azur's fucking chat

1406
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:33,980
Azur ran out of strokes

1407
01:38:33,980 --> 01:38:35,980
Marcy ran out of time

1408
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:37,980
I'm not the last place, let's go

1409
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:39,980
It's a joke

1410
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:41,980
Big trouble you today

1411
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:43,980
Oh sorry

1412
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:45,980
Is that

1413
01:38:45,980 --> 01:38:47,980
It's me just losing it

1414
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:49,980
I was losing it, I was

1415
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:51,980
Oh it is you

1416
01:38:51,980 --> 01:38:53,980
Can you tell who's losing it?

1417
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:55,980
Marcy said it's a joke

1418
01:38:55,980 --> 01:38:57,980
Oh

1419
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:03,980
Excuse me

1420
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:05,980
You're excused

1421
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:07,980
Have I gone the wrong way?

1422
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:09,980
No, I think you're in the right spot

1423
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:15,980
We're supposed to hit that really hard I think

1424
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:17,980
Are we supposed to hit the

1425
01:39:17,980 --> 01:39:19,980
Target?

1426
01:39:19,980 --> 01:39:21,980
I'll tell you

1427
01:39:21,980 --> 01:39:23,980
Holy shit

1428
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:25,980
No way

1429
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:29,980
No

1430
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:33,980
Guys, where am I and how am I supposed to get there?

1431
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:37,980
I just fell off the face of the earth

1432
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:39,980
This hard?

1433
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:41,980
I'm still falling

1434
01:39:41,980 --> 01:39:43,980
Where's the

1435
01:39:43,980 --> 01:39:45,980
Where's the hole?

1436
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:47,980
The blue

1437
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:49,980
The grill

1438
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,980
It's the grill

1439
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:53,980
It's the grill like the golden

1440
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:55,980
Paul of blue sapphire

1441
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:57,980
Like in between

1442
01:39:57,980 --> 01:39:59,980
Do you see the

1443
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:01,980
Oh my gosh

1444
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:03,980
I think it's almost like a hundred

1445
01:40:05,980 --> 01:40:07,980
Yeah

1446
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:09,980
Oh it's the pond

1447
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:11,980
It's a cauldron thing

1448
01:40:11,980 --> 01:40:13,980
That's weird

1449
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:17,980
Oh my god

1450
01:40:17,980 --> 01:40:19,980
It's the cauldron

1451
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:21,980
The cauldron

1452
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:23,980
That's, yeah

1453
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:25,980
I'm sure it has an actual name

1454
01:40:25,980 --> 01:40:27,980
But I have no idea what to call it

1455
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:29,980
I actually know what the function of this

1456
01:40:29,980 --> 01:40:31,980
No, I ran out of time

1457
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:35,980
Where'd you go?

1458
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:37,980
I'm not the last place

1459
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:39,980
For what I thought

1460
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:41,980
For AC

1461
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:43,980
You need to pick a game

1462
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:45,980
That you're good at so you can like

1463
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:47,980
Roll us

1464
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:49,980
It's so over

1465
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:51,980
I don't know if we told you

1466
01:40:51,980 --> 01:40:53,980
When we first met

1467
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,980
We played

1468
01:40:55,980 --> 01:40:57,980
That party game

1469
01:40:57,980 --> 01:40:59,980
What is it called?

1470
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:01,980
Jackbox

1471
01:41:01,980 --> 01:41:03,980
And poor icicle was last again

1472
01:41:03,980 --> 01:41:05,980
And I felt so bad

1473
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:07,980
Please no

1474
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:09,980
No PTSD from being last place

1475
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:11,980
And it wasn't fair

1476
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:13,980
Because the questions were like

1477
01:41:13,980 --> 01:41:15,980
English questions and they're really awkward

1478
01:41:15,980 --> 01:41:17,980
Words that's not everyday vocabulary

1479
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:19,980
So it was like

1480
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:21,980
What is the plural of this word

1481
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:23,980
What is a baby of this animal called

1482
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:25,980
And it was like

1483
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:27,980
This is the one fair on AC

1484
01:41:27,980 --> 01:41:29,980
English isn't her first language

1485
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:31,980
It's okay

1486
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:33,980
I just have low IQ it's fine

1487
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:35,980
No

1488
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:37,980
It makes you adorable

1489
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:39,980
Correct

1490
01:41:39,980 --> 01:41:41,980
You're not dumb sorry

1491
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:43,980
You're not dumb

1492
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:45,980
You're not dumb

1493
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:47,980
I think it was

1494
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:49,980
Thank you

1495
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:51,980

Oh my god you really are

1503
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:07,980
Fucking higher in the delivery chug

1504
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:09,980
Oh my god the next goal is the

1505
01:42:09,980 --> 01:42:11,980
P allure allegation

1506
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:13,980
Oh fuck

1507
01:42:13,980 --> 01:42:15,980
Wait what's the P allure allegation

1508
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:17,980

So four of you may or may not

01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:21,980
Have peed on microphone

1511
01:42:21,980 --> 01:42:23,980
Azura hasn't and I'm next

1512
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:25,980
After her

1513
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:27,980
I said if Azura finishes it

1514
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:29,980
I will finish it

1515
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:31,980
Wait what

1516
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:33,980
Wait I have to look at her because we've all

1517
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:35,980
Peed

1518
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:37,980
Lemonade into the toilet

1519
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:39,980
We made Wink Wink Lemonade

1520
01:42:39,980 --> 01:42:41,980
Yes

1521
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:43,980
I just had an idol meeting

1522
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:45,980
I don't know what to do I don't handle idol

1523
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:47,980
Four girls

1524
01:42:47,980 --> 01:42:49,980
I didn't look at Azura's channel

1525
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:51,980
Literally

1526
01:42:51,980 --> 01:42:53,980
Why is that spanking me

1527
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:55,980
I've had worse things on my own channel

1528
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:57,980
Oh just like

1529
01:42:57,980 --> 01:42:59,980
Why is it like there's shit everywhere

1530
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:01,980
It was like

1531
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:03,980
AC need

1532
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:05,980
ME need, SHIBI need and MERSI need

And then STRONI need

1535
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:11,980

1536
01:43:11,980 --> 01:43:13,980
STRONI need

01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:15,980

Gotta hit the middle of the center

1540
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:21,980
You gotta

1541
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:23,980
I literally

1542
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:25,980
Cannot get on this

1543
01:43:25,980 --> 01:43:27,980
Oh I did it

1544
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:29,980
I'm not

1545
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:31,980
Once too hard

1546
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:33,980
I can't seem to feign

1547
01:43:33,980 --> 01:43:35,980
Let's go

1548
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:37,980
Is everyone struggling to get on this

1549
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:39,980
Platform as well

1550
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:41,980

It's just you

1552
01:43:43,980 --> 01:43:45,980
It's too hard

1553
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:47,980
It's just you

1554
01:43:47,980 --> 01:43:49,980
You can what Tabernac there

1555
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:51,980
I said it Tabernac

1556
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,980
I said it

1557
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:55,980
Oh MERSI

1558
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:57,980
Are we going to temple

1559
01:43:57,980 --> 01:43:59,980
French Cubic

1560
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:01,980
Is like Tabernac

1561
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:03,980
Wait where's the hole

1562
01:44:03,980 --> 01:44:05,980
Why did it put me back

1563
01:44:05,980 --> 01:44:07,980
Oh no I finished

1564
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:09,980
I finished

1565
01:44:09,980 --> 01:44:11,980
Cubic that's right

1566
01:44:11,980 --> 01:44:13,980
That's the hole is that

1567
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:15,980
I'm punishing IME and MERSI

1568
01:44:15,980 --> 01:44:17,980
Whenever IME and MERSI misbehave

1569
01:44:17,980 --> 01:44:19,980
I punish them with French

1570
01:44:19,980 --> 01:44:21,980
But not just any kind of French

1571
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:23,980
Scottish accent French

1572
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:25,980
Kelly, Ladat or Jean-Tui

1573
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:27,980
Elphie, Blue

1574
01:44:27,980 --> 01:44:29,980
Come see comme ça

1575
01:44:29,980 --> 01:44:31,980
Oui

1576
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:33,980
What other French that I know

1577
01:44:33,980 --> 01:44:35,980
Oh

1578
01:44:35,980 --> 01:44:37,980
Mon père

1579
01:44:41,980 --> 01:44:43,980
Oh je voudrais

1580
01:44:43,980 --> 01:44:45,980
une

1581
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:47,980
Peeler allegations

1582
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:49,980
It's awful

1583
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:51,980
It's awful

1584
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:53,980
Je voudrais une

1585
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:55,980
Peeler allegations

1586
01:44:55,980 --> 01:44:57,980
I would like a pee

1587
01:44:57,980 --> 01:44:59,980
This is a real punishment

1588
01:44:59,980 --> 01:45:01,980
Suspension isn't punishment around these parts

1589
01:45:01,980 --> 01:45:03,980

You sound like a character

1603
01:45:29,980 --> 01:45:31,980
from in any Sims game

1604
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:33,980

01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:03,980
Doors stuck

1620
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:05,980
Doors stuck

1621
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:07,980
Doors stuck

01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:23,980

AC is going feral

1634
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:33,980
You can't go that way

1635
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:35,980
You can't go that way

1636
01:46:35,980 --> 01:46:37,980
You cannot go that way

1637
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:39,980
Full on instinct

1638
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:41,980
I need to be sent to the asylum after this fucking

01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:43,980

Oh my god

1642
01:46:47,980 --> 01:46:49,980
AC had a short that came out

1643
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:51,980
It was her missing a word

1644
01:46:51,980 --> 01:46:53,980
And it got so many views

1645
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:55,980
It was so cute

1646
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:57,980
But it got so many views and I was like damn AC

1647
01:46:57,980 --> 01:46:59,980

Is this asylum

1656
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:17,980
It's not asylum

1657
01:47:17,980 --> 01:47:19,980
Asylum

1658
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:21,980
Asylum

1659
01:47:21,980 --> 01:47:23,980
Asylum

1660
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:25,980
Asylum

1661
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:27,980
Asylum

1662
01:47:27,980 --> 01:47:29,980

1663
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:31,980

Oh right don't do it too hard

1670
01:47:49,980 --> 01:47:51,980
Don't do it too hard up that

1671
01:47:51,980 --> 01:47:53,980
Too late

1672
01:47:53,980 --> 01:47:55,980
Oh and I did it too gentle naturally

1673
01:47:55,980 --> 01:47:57,980

01:47:57,980 --> 01:47:59,980
Whoopsies

1675
01:47:59,980 --> 01:48:01,980
You gotta hit it just right

1676
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:03,980
The designs are quite nice

1677
01:48:03,980 --> 01:48:05,980
Nobody can take the internet out again

1678
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:07,980
I hear she be

1679
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:09,980

1681
01:48:11,980 --> 01:48:13,980
Are you in game

01:48:13,980 --> 01:48:15,980
I'm still in game

1683
01:48:15,980 --> 01:48:17,980

1684
01:48:17,980 --> 01:48:19,980
The game is the internet is like

1685
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:21,980
I know what's important here

1686
01:48:21,980 --> 01:48:23,980
Make sure she can continue playing the game

1687
01:48:23,980 --> 01:48:25,980
Literally what the fuck

1688
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:27,980
Okay there are bridges to go down

1689
01:48:27,980 --> 01:48:29,980
So you don't need to whack too hard to get to the bottom

1690
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:31,980
I like to whack hard

1691
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:33,980

Oh my god it looks like

01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:39,980
It looks like Emmy had picked up Strani's ball

1694
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:43,980
They're taking me away

1695
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:45,980
They said they've had enough of me being in game

1696
01:48:45,980 --> 01:48:47,980
It means that I'm kidding

1697

1700
01:48:53,980 --> 01:48:55,980

01:48:55,980 --> 01:48:57,980

01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:45,980
I ain't gonna do it for the vine

1781
01:51:45,980 --> 01:51:47,980
That's rude

1782
01:51:47,980 --> 01:51:49,980
You can bang the gong

1783
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:51,980
Where are we supposed to go

1784
01:51:51,980 --> 01:51:53,980
Oh that way

1785
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:55,980
We can't hit the gong

1786
01:51:55,980 --> 01:51:57,980
Oh no make sure you do it

1787
01:51:57,980 --> 01:51:59,980
Oh right no it's fine oh my god

1788
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:01,980
Whoa

1789
01:52:01,980 --> 01:52:03,980
You got in

1790
01:52:03,980 --> 01:52:05,980
That was amazing I just saw that

1791
01:52:05,980 --> 01:52:07,980
Strongy I'm so sorry

1792
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:09,980
You're not sorry my ping

1793
01:52:09,980 --> 01:52:11,980
My ping's better than yours

1794
01:52:11,980 --> 01:52:13,980
That's pretty accurate

1795
01:52:13,980 --> 01:52:15,980
Oh no

1796
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:17,980
Let's see

1797
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:19,980
There's a wee lotus flower

1798
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:21,980
That was a great trick shot

1799
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:23,980
Oh my god it's Sakura

1800
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:25,980

1801
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:27,980

1803
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:31,980
My favorite is strongy just being really

1804
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:33,980
Really bad

1805
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:35,980

1806
01:52:35,980 --> 01:52:37,980

1807
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:39,980
Well actually right this is really terrible lord

1808
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:41,980
I can only say sentences from hentai

1809
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:43,980
So I can say stuff like oh that feels good

1810
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:45,980

01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:47,980

We need a taste

1814
01:52:51,980 --> 01:52:53,980

01:52:53,980 --> 01:52:55,980
Onii-chan

1816
01:52:55,980 --> 01:52:57,980

1819
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:03,980

01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:07,980
It sounds like you at all

1822
01:53:07,980 --> 01:53:09,980
It doesn't feel good

1823
01:53:09,980 --> 01:53:11,980
It wasn't

1824
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:13,980
Taisho puo ni to

1825
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:15,980

1828
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:21,980
Pop in my head

1829
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:23,980

1878
01:55:03,980 --> 01:55:05,980

01:55:05,980 --> 01:55:07,980
They try to catch me riding

1880
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:09,980
Cushing

1881
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:11,980
They're holding

1882
01:55:11,980 --> 01:55:13,980
They're trying to get me riding

01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:15,980
Yo I'm not lost

1884
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:17,980
Try to catch me riding

1885
01:55:17,980 --> 01:55:19,980

That was

1888
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:27,980
This is like Harry Potter's type stuff

1889
01:55:27,980 --> 01:55:29,980
Can I like just fall down

1890
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:31,980
Into this one

1891
01:55:31,980 --> 01:55:33,980
Where are we supposed to go

1892
01:55:33,980 --> 01:55:35,980
Please please please

1893
01:55:35,980 --> 01:55:37,980
Down the tomb

1894
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:39,980
Where do we go

1895
01:55:39,980 --> 01:55:41,980
Down there

1896
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:43,980
I can't even

1897
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,980
Where the fuck

1898
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:47,980
It's on the floor

1899
01:55:47,980 --> 01:55:49,980
That's the old hole into it

1900
01:55:49,980 --> 01:55:51,980
Is it where it's put

1901
01:55:51,980 --> 01:55:53,980
Yeah it's 17 we're on for 8

1902
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:55,980
I can't even find it so I'm looking around

1903
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:57,980
I don't know where to go

1904
01:55:57,980 --> 01:55:59,980
I can't see

1905
01:55:59,980 --> 01:56:01,980
Is it actually

1906
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:03,980
It's on the ceiling

1907
01:56:03,980 --> 01:56:05,980
On the ceiling

1908
01:56:05,980 --> 01:56:07,980
Oh you

1909
01:56:07,980 --> 01:56:09,980
You don't have to tell me twice

1910
01:56:09,980 --> 01:56:11,980
You don't have to tell me twice to you

1911
01:56:11,980 --> 01:56:13,980
What the fuck is on the ceiling

1912
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:15,980
Okay

1913
01:56:15,980 --> 01:56:17,980
Why can't I just go all the way down here

1914
01:56:17,980 --> 01:56:19,980
I can't see anything though

1915
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:21,980
That's such bullshit

1916
01:56:21,980 --> 01:56:23,980
The hole is literally down there

1917
01:56:23,980 --> 01:56:25,980
No no that's the old one

1918
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:27,980
That's the old one

1919
01:56:27,980 --> 01:56:29,980
It's up

1920
01:56:29,980 --> 01:56:31,980
I'm fucking stupid never mind

1921
01:56:31,980 --> 01:56:33,980
I really thought I found

1922
01:56:33,980 --> 01:56:35,980
Out like an amazing way

1923
01:56:35,980 --> 01:56:37,980
To get it

1924
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:39,980
I already tried that way

1925
01:56:39,980 --> 01:56:41,980
Gravity changes

1926
01:56:41,980 --> 01:56:43,980
If you look around

1927
01:56:43,980 --> 01:56:45,980
Gravity changes when you go up

1928
01:56:45,980 --> 01:56:47,980
So up is down but when you go up

1929
01:56:47,980 --> 01:56:49,980
I don't know how to get up there

1930
01:56:49,980 --> 01:56:51,980
I'm sorry

1931
01:56:51,980 --> 01:56:53,980
I'm on the wall

1932
01:56:53,980 --> 01:56:55,980
Mercy do you see where she is

1933
01:56:55,980 --> 01:56:57,980
You need to go on that side and then

1934
01:56:57,980 --> 01:56:59,980
Eat yourself off the platform

1935
01:56:59,980 --> 01:57:01,980
Yes perfect

1936
01:57:01,980 --> 01:57:03,980
Eating

1937
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:05,980
What the fuck

1938
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:07,980
Where am I

1939
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:09,980
You're

1940
01:57:09,980 --> 01:57:11,980

1941
01:57:11,980 --> 01:57:13,980
Oh we love you

1942
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:15,980
No there's only one second

1943
01:57:15,980 --> 01:57:17,980
No I wanted to do it

1944
01:57:17,980 --> 01:57:19,980
It looks so good

1945
01:57:19,980 --> 01:57:21,980
I wanted to finish

1946
01:57:21,980 --> 01:57:23,980
I was so close

1947
01:57:23,980 --> 01:57:25,980
No

1948
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:27,980
Oh my god

1949
01:57:27,980 --> 01:57:29,980
I got a plunger

1950
01:57:29,980 --> 01:57:31,980
I got a Joby again

1951
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:33,980
You got another shit

01:57:33,980 --> 01:57:35,980
You got another shit

1953
01:57:35,980 --> 01:57:37,980
I got two Joby

1954
01:57:37,980 --> 01:57:39,980
We did it

1955
01:57:39,980 --> 01:57:41,980
I got the plunger you got the shit

1956
01:57:41,980 --> 01:57:43,980
I got a pink hat

1957
01:57:43,980 --> 01:57:45,980
So who's got the fart

1958
01:57:45,980 --> 01:57:47,980
I love it

1959
01:57:47,980 --> 01:57:49,980
I love when they do that

1960
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:51,980
And rap where they just go

1961
01:57:51,980 --> 01:57:53,980
Random

1962
01:57:53,980 --> 01:57:55,980
Country boy

1963
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:57,980
I love you

1964
01:57:57,980 --> 01:57:59,980
Okay

1965
01:57:59,980 --> 01:58:01,980

And we got to have Vila our time together

1969
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:09,980

01:59:27,980 --> 01:59:29,980
But after their streams anyway

01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:31,980

02:00:07,980 --> 02:00:09,980
Robert LaBruce in my bloodline

02:00:09,980 --> 02:00:11,980

2030
02:00:11,980 --> 02:00:13,980

02:00:17,980 --> 02:00:19,980

Thank you

2041
02:00:33,980 --> 02:00:35,980

2042
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:37,980
Super chat dusk slayer for the Super chat

2043
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:39,980

2044
02:00:39,980 --> 02:00:41,980
Memberships I appreciate it

2045
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:43,980
I do apologise I couldn't interact too much

2046
02:00:43,980 --> 02:00:45,980
You know how it is when we do

2047
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:47,980
Collaboerations

2048
02:00:47,980 --> 02:00:49,980
I promise you I am actually looking at you

2049
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:51,980
A lot and reading but I don't say it out loud

2050
02:00:51,980 --> 02:00:53,980
Because I don't want to talk over the girls

2051
02:00:53,980 --> 02:00:55,980
But I'm going to fart inside Azura's nostrils

2052
02:00:55,980 --> 02:00:57,980
So freaking hard

2053
02:00:57,980 --> 02:00:59,980
I've told her remove the filter off of discord

2054
02:00:59,980 --> 02:01:01,980
And she's like there's no filter on my make

2055
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:03,980
And I can't hear her at the time

2056
02:01:03,980 --> 02:01:05,980
She's getting bent over my knee and spanked

2057
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:07,980
Even though she's like

2058
02:01:07,980 --> 02:01:09,980
Well technically she's like a billion times taller than me

2059
02:01:09,980 --> 02:01:11,980
Because she's a giant Tess

2060
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:13,980
Now for the agendation reeflings

2061
02:01:13,980 --> 02:01:15,980
For me personally

2062
02:01:15,980 --> 02:01:17,980
I'm going to end this stream and redirect into Azura

2063
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:19,980
But I'm going to boot up a very quick

2064
02:01:19,980 --> 02:01:21,980
Drawing stream

2065
02:01:21,980 --> 02:01:23,980
Now the stream says I'm doodling

2066
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:25,980
My gen mates

2067
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:27,980
But when you open up the doodling my gen mates

2068
02:01:27,980 --> 02:01:29,980
Stream you're going to know it's not

2069
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:31,980
My gen mates it's for Azura

2070
02:01:31,980 --> 02:01:33,980
Okay Azura just reached 7.5

2071
02:01:33,980 --> 02:01:35,980
Oh my god you guys are support

2072
02:01:35,980 --> 02:01:37,980
Bro I was joking about her

2073
02:01:37,980 --> 02:01:39,980
Opening up

2074
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:41,980
I was joking about

2075
02:01:41,980 --> 02:01:43,980
Her hire in the moving truck

2076
02:01:43,980 --> 02:01:45,980
After today

2077
02:01:45,980 --> 02:01:47,980
I don't think we're joking anymore

2078
02:01:47,980 --> 02:01:49,980
I mean

2079
02:01:49,980 --> 02:01:51,980
Shit

2080
02:01:51,980 --> 02:01:53,980
Fucking hell you guys are supporting her at the Wazoo

2081
02:01:53,980 --> 02:01:55,980
Thank you everyone who has said

2082
02:01:55,980 --> 02:01:57,980
I tried so hard to be like

2083
02:01:57,980 --> 02:01:59,980
Oh my god Tihi

2084
02:01:59,980 --> 02:02:01,980
Thank you XYZ

2085
02:02:01,980 --> 02:02:03,980
Obviously I can't see

2086
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:05,980
Who's singing and Azura is obviously

2087
02:02:05,980 --> 02:02:07,980
Talking away to herself too

2088
02:02:07,980 --> 02:02:09,980
The reeflings understand

2089
02:02:09,980 --> 02:02:11,980
The assignment

2090
02:02:11,980 --> 02:02:13,980
I'm so happy when she moves out

2091
02:02:13,980 --> 02:02:15,980
Holy shit you guys are getting spoiled

2092
02:02:15,980 --> 02:02:17,980
Getting heart

2093
02:02:17,980 --> 02:02:19,980
Anyone and everyone that watches her content

2094
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:21,980
Is going to get spoiled

2095
02:02:21,980 --> 02:02:23,980
But yes

2096
02:02:23,980 --> 02:02:25,980
I'm so freaking happy

2097
02:02:25,980 --> 02:02:27,980
She's doing so good

2098
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:29,980
If she's already at 7.5k

2099
02:02:29,980 --> 02:02:31,980
Holy fuck

2100
02:02:31,980 --> 02:02:33,980
She like about to move the fuck out

2101
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:35,980
I don't know what her agendination is

2102
02:02:35,980 --> 02:02:37,980
For the rest of the day

2103
02:02:37,980 --> 02:02:39,980
I'm not quite sure

2104
02:02:39,980 --> 02:02:41,980
But yes I am going to

2105
02:02:41,980 --> 02:02:43,980
Redirect into her

2106
02:02:43,980 --> 02:02:45,980
That chaotic collab

2107
02:02:45,980 --> 02:02:47,980
Per AC

2108
02:02:47,980 --> 02:02:49,980
Oh my god I heard AC expel

2109
02:02:49,980 --> 02:02:51,980
Like her Psy

2110
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:53,980
AC has a really specific Psy

2111
02:02:53,980 --> 02:02:55,980
That tells me she's fed up and she's about to go feral

2112
02:02:55,980 --> 02:02:57,980
And she went feral

2113
02:02:57,980 --> 02:02:59,980
I was so nervous I was like no AC no

2114
02:02:59,980 --> 02:03:01,980
But per acical

2115
02:03:01,980 --> 02:03:03,980
I'm sure we'll play a game

2116
02:03:03,980 --> 02:03:05,980
That she will

2117
02:03:05,980 --> 02:03:07,980
You know roll and smoke us on

2118
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:09,980
I don't know what that game might be

2119
02:03:09,980 --> 02:03:11,980
It might be Fallen Monkeys

2120
02:03:11,980 --> 02:03:13,980
And if we do that off collab

2121
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:15,980
Not her idea

2122
02:03:15,980 --> 02:03:17,980
My idea we'll play Beyblades

2123
02:03:17,980 --> 02:03:19,980
And like Buckaroo

2124
02:03:19,980 --> 02:03:21,980
And then that monkey thing

2125
02:03:21,980 --> 02:03:23,980
That monkey game where you pull out

2126
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:25,980
Pull out like a sword thing

2127
02:03:25,980 --> 02:03:27,980
To stop them all falling down

2128
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:29,980
And like Jenga

2129
02:03:29,980 --> 02:03:31,980
I just about said Tenga

2130
02:03:31,980 --> 02:03:33,980
Well I said it now but you know what I mean

2131
02:03:33,980 --> 02:03:35,980
But yes

2132
02:03:35,980 --> 02:03:37,980
I'm going to redirect into her

2133
02:03:37,980 --> 02:03:39,980
I'm going to get a cup of tea and I'm going to rehydrate

2134
02:03:39,980 --> 02:03:41,980
Like it's sweating through that

2135
02:03:41,980 --> 02:03:43,980
But yes please do feel free

2136
02:03:43,980 --> 02:03:45,980
To lurk in the background of Azura

2137
02:03:45,980 --> 02:03:47,980
It does not matter

2138
02:03:47,980 --> 02:03:49,980
You do not have to give money please

2139
02:03:49,980 --> 02:03:51,980
Don't feel like you oh my god I must give money

2140
02:03:51,980 --> 02:03:53,980
No you don't have to

2141
02:03:53,980 --> 02:03:55,980
Even just lurking and giving the stream a little like

2142
02:03:55,980 --> 02:03:57,980
Is super duper helpful and it really is

2143
02:03:57,980 --> 02:03:59,980
Fantastic so

2144
02:03:59,980 --> 02:04:01,980
I'm going to redirect into her now

2145
02:04:01,980 --> 02:04:03,980
Give me 5 minutes and I'll start up in

2146
02:04:03,980 --> 02:04:05,980
What about Twister in Underwear

2147
02:04:05,980 --> 02:04:07,980
Oh yeah you want us to film that yeah

2148
02:04:07,980 --> 02:04:09,980
What is it

2149
02:04:09,980 --> 02:04:11,980
Is that the monkey game where you stab a barrel

2150
02:04:11,980 --> 02:04:13,980
With plastic swords

2151
02:04:13,980 --> 02:04:15,980
Yeah there was that one

2152
02:04:15,980 --> 02:04:17,980
And then there's another one where it's see through

2153
02:04:17,980 --> 02:04:19,980
And if you pull out the thing

2154
02:04:19,980 --> 02:04:21,980
It like makes them all fall down

2155
02:04:21,980 --> 02:04:23,980
But you don't want them to fall down or something

2156
02:04:23,980 --> 02:04:25,980
Like that I can't remember

2157
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:27,980
Asi's mind went feral

2158
02:04:27,980 --> 02:04:29,980
When she said like oh I shouldn't say it

2159
02:04:29,980 --> 02:04:31,980
I thought she was going to say something about funny Teehee

2160
02:04:31,980 --> 02:04:33,980
Oh no she went straight for it

2161
02:04:33,980 --> 02:04:35,980
She wants a taste testing of everyone

2162
02:04:35,980 --> 02:04:37,980
Asi

2163
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:39,980
One that's wailed

2164
02:04:39,980 --> 02:04:41,980
Two I'm so fucking down

2165
02:04:41,980 --> 02:04:43,980
I thought it would be really funny if we did an off collab

2166
02:04:43,980 --> 02:04:45,980
That all the girls like spanked me

2167
02:04:45,980 --> 02:04:47,980
One by one for being like your shit

2168
02:04:47,980 --> 02:04:49,980
Haha

2169
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:51,980
But that's just me

2170
02:04:51,980 --> 02:04:53,980
Me being like oh my god Asi

2171
02:04:53,980 --> 02:04:55,980
That's so shocking also

2172
02:04:55,980 --> 02:04:57,980
Me secretly like hey are you guys down for this

2173
02:04:57,980 --> 02:04:59,980
I think this is going to be really funny

2174
02:05:01,980 --> 02:05:03,980
But yes

2175
02:05:03,980 --> 02:05:05,980
As I said I'm going to redirect into Ezra

2176
02:05:05,980 --> 02:05:07,980
Please hang out and give me 5 minutes to get my stream prepared

2177
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:09,980
Because I need to pop a few things on stream

2178
02:05:09,980 --> 02:05:11,980
I'm going to make a cup of tea and I'm going to go for a tinkle

2179
02:05:11,980 --> 02:05:13,980
Because I'm not normally up at this time

2180
02:05:13,980 --> 02:05:15,980
And I forgot to tinkle before

2181
02:05:15,980 --> 02:05:17,980
I started no stream

2182
02:05:17,980 --> 02:05:19,980
You mean tumbling monkey's game

2183
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:21,980
I found it and maybe a collab on the other site

2184
02:05:21,980 --> 02:05:23,980
I thought you meant you were down for the off collab taco eating

2185
02:05:23,980 --> 02:05:25,980
I mean

2186
02:05:25,980 --> 02:05:27,980
If the others were down for it

2187
02:05:27,980 --> 02:05:29,980
If your friends would jump off a cliff

2188
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:31,980
Would you follow them too

2189
02:05:31,980 --> 02:05:33,980
If they're down for it

2190
02:05:33,980 --> 02:05:35,980
She

2191
02:05:35,980 --> 02:05:37,980
Who am I saying no

2192
02:05:37,980 --> 02:05:39,980
So I was like yogurt is for everyone

2193
02:05:39,980 --> 02:05:41,980
Fruit for everyone

2194
02:05:41,980 --> 02:05:43,980
Hydration for everyone

2195
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:45,980
And then Asi will be like

2196
02:05:45,980 --> 02:05:47,980
That one's strawberry

2197
02:05:47,980 --> 02:05:49,980
Someone's had some mango yogurt

2198
02:05:51,980 --> 02:05:53,980
Okay

2199
02:05:53,980 --> 02:05:55,980
Redirect into Ezra

2200
02:05:55,980 --> 02:05:57,980
I'm going to get

2201
02:05:57,980 --> 02:05:59,980
And then give me 5 minutes

2202
02:05:59,980 --> 02:06:01,980
To start up our secret drawing

2203
02:06:01,980 --> 02:06:03,980
For Ezra

2204
02:06:03,980 --> 02:06:05,980
Because I'm not actually drawing my 10 minutes

2205
02:06:05,980 --> 02:06:07,980
I'm drawing Ezra

2206
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:09,980
Okay

2207
02:06:09,980 --> 02:06:11,980
And if the redirect doesn't work

2208
02:06:11,980 --> 02:06:13,980
Then I have a fantastic link and chat for you

2209
02:06:13,980 --> 02:06:15,980
7 bowls with 7 flavours

2210
02:06:15,980 --> 02:06:17,980
5 kuchi flavours

2211
02:06:17,980 --> 02:06:19,980
Can she decide who's been eating what yogurt

2212
02:06:19,980 --> 02:06:21,980
Right enough

2213
02:06:21,980 --> 02:06:23,980
Enough of my shenanigans

2214
02:06:23,980 --> 02:06:25,980
I see in 5 minutes

2215
02:06:25,980 --> 02:06:27,980
If not

2216
02:06:27,980 --> 02:06:29,980
Even if you've got it on in the background

2217
02:06:29,980 --> 02:06:31,980
Leave it on your computer

2218
02:06:31,980 --> 02:06:33,980
I appreciate it

2219
02:06:37,980 --> 02:06:39,980
That was a big smooch

2220
02:06:39,980 --> 02:06:41,980
We should do it again

2221
02:06:45,980 --> 02:06:47,980
Okay 2 big smooches

2222
02:06:47,980 --> 02:06:49,980
Because I won

2223
02:06:51,980 --> 02:06:53,980
Okay I'll see you in 5 minutes

2224
02:06:53,980 --> 02:06:55,980
Bye bye
