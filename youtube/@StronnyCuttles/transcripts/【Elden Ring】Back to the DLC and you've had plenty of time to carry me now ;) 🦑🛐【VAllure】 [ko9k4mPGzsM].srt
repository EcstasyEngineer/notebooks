1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
It's signed up my YouTube again for the very first time.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,100
Good morning.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,900
Hi, Baudry Plain.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,100
Mm, I'm giving you technical.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,600
I've not even got Elden Ring open. Oh my god, stop!

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,100
Such a bad streamer. I've not even started to play Elden Ring open.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:24,400
I don't even know where we are in the DLC, but that's okay because

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,800
as long as I have you and we're together you will carry me through the game

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,600
because I don't know how to play Elden Ring.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,400
Good morning.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,900
Hold on, let me check.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,100
Yes, and everyone should be able to carry me in the DLC now

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,800
because you've played it so much. Good morning, Nan.

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,200
Good evening, good afternoon.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,700
Hi, little Baudry Plain. How are you today?

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,600
Are you ready for three long days of stream sniping?

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,700
Um, I just want to start this stream off by saying

18
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,800
I'm sorry for getting political, but I had liquid diarrhea.

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Um, I don't know why.

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:15,000
I've, I don't, I'm not sure why, um, but the fucking smell was bogging.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,600
So, um, yeah, I just thought you should know.

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,400
I don't know if I need to go for like five minutes and disappear.

23
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh, that was me.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,100
That was my PC.

25
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,600
That was me.

26
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,300
That was me.

27
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,600
Hold on.

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,100
Hold on, it was me.

29
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,600
I need, I need to plug him a little fucking, my controller, please.

30
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,600
Why do you do that so easily?

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh my God.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,800
See this keyboard?

33
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:47,600
I'm actually gonna, oh, I need it to be wired.

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Uh, I don't know why.

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,200
I had a chicken burrito in there, but it tasted fine.

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,800
That was me.

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,400
That was me.

38
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,000
That's not you.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,400
That's me.

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,200
That's my PC.

41
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,800
My PC is popping off.

42
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,200
Um, right.

43
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,800
Updates.

44
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:10,800
If you are a harem, a snippet and a pinpal, there's content on Patreon.

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,700
If you are a snowberry and a bleeding heart within 24 hours,

46
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,300
you have an emergency audio commission coming through.

47
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,200
It will be uploaded in, I repeat, 24 hours.

48
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,500
You will have the audio.

49
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:29,200
If you are a refling as always, we get cast to decide a little bit.

50
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,000
I need a bit of time.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,300
Um, the audio manager is coming in today.

52
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,800
Like it's already been set up in the background.

53
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,300
I don't know what's happening.

54
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,500
I just need to write a little sheet that says at the end of the month, tell us

55
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,400
how many hours you took to edit and we will pay you your payment.

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,300
Basically is what I have to do.

57
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,300
So I am no longer the owl for sending audios back and forth.

58
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,500
Yeah.

59
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,300
Um, so what does that mean?

60
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:04,000
It mean at the start of the month, I can finally post a graphic of what the content

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,700
is on Patreon for the month.

62
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,100
Okay.

63
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,900
Finally.

64
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,900
Finally.

65
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,500
Okay.

66
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,300
I know I said I'd do it this month, but the manager got delayed.

67
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,300
Things got delayed, but I can finally do it.

68
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,800
So you'll finally know what comes up.

69
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,000
Where the, what am I wearing?

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,200
Are we in the flower field?

71
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,500
Oh my God.

72
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,200
I don't want to be alone.

73
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,800
Oh my God.

74
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,200
How do I know?

75
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
How do I summon refling?

76
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,200
Stop.

77
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,800
I don't, I've forgotten everything.

78
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,100
No, that's stop.

79
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,900
I'm alone.

80
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,800
How do I call you in X?

81
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,100
No, that's to heal.

82
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,100
Okay.

83
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,500
Why shows me?

84
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
I don't know how to come.

85
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't know how to get you here.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,100
It's been so long.

87
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,800
It's been so long.

88
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,100
Do you guys know where I am?

89
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,200
I'm a lamenter's gown.

90
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
Please come.

91
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Please save me.

92
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,600
Oh God.

93
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,400
What's her password?

94
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,900
Wait, hold on.

95
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,900
Multiplayer password.

96
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,400
Reef.

97
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay.

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,800
I'm, I'm a pin that right now.

99
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,500
It's been, it's been so long.

100
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,100
Okay.

101
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,000
I will pin.

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,400
Okay.

103
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,900
What's it called?

104
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,300
Multiplayer password.

105
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,500
Reef.

106
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,000
And now as always today is very most likely, very most

107
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,400
likely, uh, and God, please pin.

108
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,900
Step outside and use it.

109
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,600
Oh my God, refling.

110
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,100
Oh my God.

111
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,800
Save me.

112
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,400
Thank you from soul.

113
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,900
Is that a refling?

114
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,600
No, I'm, I'm, I'm just, I think you're a refling.

115
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,200
Thank you from soul.

116
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Thank you from soul.

117
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,500
Yeah.

118
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Cause I'm using a public password thing.

119
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,400
My barber.

120
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,200
He got the refling hat on me.

121
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay.

122
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,500
Um, this is an endurance stream.

123
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,500
So please do not be afraid at any point to pop out to

124
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,300
watch any of my gen mates when they go up, please.

125
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,100
Oh my God.

126
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,800
The coconut moons.

127
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
I forgot.

128
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,600
Oh my God.

129
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,900
I forgot the coconut moons.

130
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh, I'm going to reef so hard.

131
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,600
Hi, you me.

132
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,800
Are you excited or collapse going to be wrapped up very

133
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,300
soon?

134
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,600
I'll keep you updated in them deums.

135
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,300
How many bosses have you defeated?

136
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,000
Now when you say I defeat, do you mean we as in the

137
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,700
reeflings helping me do everything?

138
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,000
Why is the cars?

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,700
Oh, we got an enemy refling.

140
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay.

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,500
I'm got math, but that doesn't count.

142
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Enemies don't really count cause you don't really get to

143
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,000
play.

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,400
Okay, ma you're in.

145
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,500
And what is this?

146
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,000
Sacred Golem Fist.

147
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,500
Are you fissing me?

148
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Oh, you give me flowers?

149
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh, they're so cute.

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,600
Hell yeah.

151
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
You me, sister-in-law.

152
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,300
Thank you for the membership.

153
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:55,900
I appreciate it.

154
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,500
How strong are you?

155
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,100
Take your time to worry.

156
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,100
I'm sick right now.

157
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,900
I have something to watch.

158
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,500
Oh my God.

159
00:05:59,500 --> 00:05:59,800
Oh my God.

160
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,300
Check out the fit.

161
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:00,900
Right.

162
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,100
Let's analyze the map.

163
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,400
It's been a hot second of the DLC.

164
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,600
Right.

165
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,000
I think we're hot.

166
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh, oh God.

167
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,200
I remember the scary fingers.

168
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Yeah.

169
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,900
They were like getting sniped from halfway across the map.

170
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,000
We seem to be at some sort of cavern pass.

171
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,400
And if you haven't fought bail curse you bail.

172
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,500
Thank you for the extended membership.

173
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,800
Hell yeah.

174
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,000
Hi Leah.

175
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,200
Hi Leah.

176
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:39,400
Now, if I recall correctly, we were stuck on the sneak guy

177
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,800
and I couldn't figure out how it progressed.

178
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,300
Oh my God.

179
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:42,900
That's right.

180
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,100
I can jump on you.

181
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,900
How did I do it?

182
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,200
Oh my God.

183
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Muscle memory is kicking in.

184
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,900
There's an item that I can slam you down with.

185
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,400
Oh my God.

186
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,200
What is it?

187
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,400
No.

188
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,000
I forgot.

189
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,700
Is it this one?

190
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,800
I think it's this one.

191
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
What did I do?

192
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,200
Nope, that's slash.

193
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,800
Nope, jump.

194
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,700
How did I use my ultimate?

195
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,200
No.

196
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,500
Stop drinking the flasks.

197
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh my God.

198
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,700
I'm so sorry.

199
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,800
I've completely forgotten how to play this game.

200
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,300
I remember.

201
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,600
I remember.

202
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:17,800
Okay.

203
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
I was a bit of a range but there you go.

204
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,100
Okay.

205
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,300
We're remembering.

206
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,200
This is going to be very painful.

207
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,000
Painful.

208
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,400
Okay.

209
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:24,800
Painful.

210
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,000
Hold on.

211
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Let me.

212
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,800
Leah, just make sure that I'm calibrated.

213
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,200
Ground pound.

214
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,400
Sorry.

215
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,000
I send you off to war with ground pound.

216
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,600
Oh my God.

217
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes.

218
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,300
Right.

219
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,800
How do I upgrade my weapon?

220
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,000
I forgot everything about this game.

221
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,300
Oh, is that your ass, man?

222
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,100
Let me hold it.

223
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,500
Oh, no.

224
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,000
I've started the freaking battle music.

225
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I forgot.

226
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,400
Right.

227
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,300
Let me.

228
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,900
So this was my main sword.

229
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,900
I can swing my sword.

230
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,800
Right.

231
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,600
Land octopus ovary.

232
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,000
Are you implying Gen 2?

233
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,300
I can't believe that.

234
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,200
What are we doing first?

235
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,500
You know how to play.

236
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,400
I've like completely forgotten.

237
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:08,600
Right.

238
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,100
We seem.

239
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,500
Oh, I can't open up my map.

240
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,800
Oh dear.

241
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,900
Oh God, heals real.

242
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,400
Right.

243
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,800
I don't actually recall a single thing.

244
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,800
I guess we'll go up the hill.

245
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,400
Or do I just throw you into that boss fight with a snake?

246
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,800
Oh wait, how do I do two-handed?

247
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,400
No, not that one.

248
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,300
Is it that one?

249
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:32,600
No.

250
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Why?

251
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,700
And then two-handed.

252
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,300
There we go.

253
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,000
Go has been well.

254
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,200
Apologies, Mama.

255
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,500
I am running on zero.

256
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,700
Oh, no.

257
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,900
It's been their party.

258
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,700
So I'll be on and off all streamers.

259
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,000
I fight the cousin of death.

260
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,100
Cousin of death?

261
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:52,200
Enjoy the birthday party or enjoyed in the past tense.

262
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,800
Uh, right.

263
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,900
Well, we go.

264
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,800
What will we do?

265
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,200
I don't know.

266
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,000
Wait, did we even do that cavern?

267
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,200
I can't.

268
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,900
Unfortunately, I'm in a fight right now.

269
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,000
So I can't open up the map because I think I'm fighting the

270
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,800
friendly refling.

271
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,100
Right.

272
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,600
These sneaky things are bad.

273
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,300
Cousin of death low.

274
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,800
Are you squidding me right now?

275
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,400
Oh, how did I run?

276
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,900
You won't be able to join me since I don't have the game,

277
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,400
but I will be learning for all your streams.

278
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,000
Good luck and have fun you and the other reflings got this.

279
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,500
Uh, oh my God.

280
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,100
I didn't know we attack them.

281
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,800
Yeah, fuck them.

282
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,100
Sorry.

283
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,800
I forgot you're supposed to like attacking stuff in this game.

284
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,700
Hold on.

285
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,900
It's been a while.

286
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,000
It's been a while.

287
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,200
It's been a while.

288
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,000
At least I can stagger them.

289
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,900
Oh, I'm out of stamina.

290
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,300
Hold on.

291
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,200
I'm out of stamina.

292
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,900
Oh, oh, yeah.

293
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:48,500
Look at that frame perfect frame perfect.

294
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,300
Thank you, Husky.

295
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:49,700
I'm sorry.

296
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,800
You don't have the game.

297
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,800
I promise I'll play more stream snake game.

298
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,200
God, those guys are so creepy.

299
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,600
I don't like them.

300
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,300
Okay.

301
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,200
Oh my God.

302
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,600
Wait, just let me wake up.

303
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,900
You know, I need to wake up a bit.

304
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,700
Good morning.

305
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:12,400
I did literally, I've been up since midnight trying to do all this background work.

306
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,400
I had to fucking teach the script writer to write scripts the way I do it.

307
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,700
And we were having to like psychoanalyze.

308
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,000
Psych analysis.

309
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,100
Psychoanalyze.

310
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,200
Yeah, I think that's the word.

311
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,900
I had to like analyze the scripts and be like, okay, this is how I would do it.

312
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,900
This is how you've done it.

313
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,100
Right.

314
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,800
Remove this.

315
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,100
This is the fucking exhausted.

316
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm not even starting the day yet.

317
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,400
But good morning.

318
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,800
No, I did sleep.

319
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:48,900
Basically, I went to bed early and I was like, I'm just going to wake up and do all of my work.

320
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,000
Where the fuck are we going?

321
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,500
I still can't open the map.

322
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,400
That's so annoying.

323
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,500
I know I'm supposed to kill that refill, but I don't want to.

324
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,200
I have no idea where to go.

325
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,700
Not a clue.

326
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,700
Did we go down the water?

327
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,200
God, my game feels really big.

328
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,500
I don't know if it's me, but my, it feels like I'm dropping frames, bruh.

329
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm like, I can't even get up a hill.

330
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't know where we're going.

331
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,500
Will we go do the snake guy and try and remember how to fight by taking on the snake guy over and over again?

332
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,700
We've got the lion.

333
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,000
I remember the dancing lion we did.

334
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,200
My game is struggling here too.

335
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,800
Yeah, I was going to say, mine feels a bit, huh, and I'm like, huh.

336
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,900
I see that bird.

337
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,100
I see that bird.

338
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,700
I see that.

339
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,000
I see.

340
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,700
I've not got a sniper.

341
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm more of a 200 myself.

342
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,800
Mizzmer's one of the hardest bosses in the DLC.

343
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,700
Well, this thing's going first.

344
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,600
Gang violence, gang violence.

345
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
Okay, can I open up the map now?

346
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,200
I can't.

347
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,400
Right.

348
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:01,800
Okay.

349
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,500
Analysis.

350
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:03,700
Right.

351
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,500
I went up to there.

352
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,700
We can't actually physically go there.

353
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,300
I think this is what I had a problem with last time.

354
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,300
I don't know where the F to go.

355
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,800
So there was a big fucking dragon boss in there.

356
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,700
I couldn't get any further.

357
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,100
I can't seem to figure out how to get this wayward map.

358
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,200
Hmm.

359
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,300
Oh, God, there's so much to this deal.

360
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,700
I recognize nothing.

361
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,700
I'm like, should I have played this offline and then played it with you?

362
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:35,600
But I can't seem to figure out how to get on the ground over here.

363
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,500
I'm following the path.

364
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,500
And then it looks like a, it doesn't even look like a jump down.

365
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,800
Honestly, maybe it's this way.

366
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,200
Hmm.

367
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,500
Maybe some weird thing over here.

368
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:54,400
What we teleport there and take a left and then jump down with Lee Torrent.

369
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:00,000
We'll help you point out location and we'll guide you.

370
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,100
If you want me to guide your hips, there's a big castle.

371
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,400
You gotta go to it and then hold on a minute.

372
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:11,400
There's a cat comb at the bottom of the river above the gray area that gets you there.

373
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:18,600
At the bottom of the river above the gray area.

374
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,000
We can guide you on foot.

375
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Do you know where to go?

376
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
Fuck it, I'll follow the refland.

377
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,400
Surely you guys know where to go.

378
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,300
Take me somewhere new.

379
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,800
Take me, refland, take me.

380
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Do you know where to go?

381
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Maybe?

382
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't know.

383
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,400
I like, that's how much we've done.

384
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,300
The air to tree is untouched.

385
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,900
Okay, I'm just following the refland.

386
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:51,500
Following the reflings, the reflings, the reflings, the reflings and following the reflings on the way to go.

387
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,400
We may be blocked by a fog wall.

388
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,800
That's like, geez, you scared me.

389
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah.

390
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,700
I'll just, oh well that refland's got a torch so that means he knows where he's going.

391
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,000
Clearly.

392
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,700
There is a furnace golem near your location.

393
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,500
Be careful.

394
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,200
What does that mean?

395
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:19,700
What is a furnace golem?

396
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,600
Whoa, that was big.

397
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,700
I'm trying to stagger.

398
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,300
Oh my God, I'm so bad at the combat.

399
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,900
Oh, reflings, did we go for it?

400
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,900
No, you guys see the big problem?

401
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,900
Yeah.

402
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,300
You guys see the problem now?

403
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,900
Oh God, I'm stuck on a fence.

404
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,800
Will someone please think of the, no, leave him alone.

405
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,200
He's mine.

406
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,900
Fuck, fuck.

407
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh my God, it's been, no, no, no, it's fine.

408
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:05,400
Copium, it's fine.

409
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:14,400
It's been a while.

410
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,600
But it was not fine.

411
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
No, it fucking was me.

412
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,800
Oh, didn't he put me back at Big Lamentons?

413
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,300
Go wherever the fuck it is.

414
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,000
Get me out here.

415
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,500
Right, go on.

416
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,200
Why are you taking me?

417
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:33,400
That was so terrible that attempt.

418
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,400
Exactly.

419
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
No, I never said that.

420
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:47,200
No, I said, I said, I would.

421
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,600
I may or may not have been reading hate word marshmallows.

422
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Well, I haven't diary on the toilet.

423
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,400
I've been misquoted, okay?

424
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,800
I've been misquoted.

425
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,900
How dare you?

426
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,400
No, I threw an ink on the toilet.

427
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,200
That's a really strange location to ink.

428
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,500
Where are you taking me?

429
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,700
I don't want to spawn you then,

430
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,200
because obviously I can go a lot faster.

431
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,100
Did I go to the hut?

432
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,600
This seems to be some sort of hut.

433
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,900
Can I not teleport to it?

434
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,600
No, okay, I guess I'll fuck you again.

435
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,100
And what the heck am I?

436
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,600
Mummy ink.

437
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,800
Go to Cathedral of Manus Mightier.

438
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,600
Manus Mightier.

439
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,800
Cathedral of Manus Mightier.

440
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,300
Okay, and then I'll call you in,

441
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,600
and then you'll hold my hand.

442
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,500
And please clean it up afterwards.

443
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,400
You ink straight into the toilet bowl?

444
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,600
Yeah, take that toilet, you sexy bitch.

445
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,700
What?

446
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,900
Who said that?

447
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,500
Why can't I summon inside the church?

448
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
Don't do that.

449
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,300
Is this guy mean to me or is he nice?

450
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,700
No, he still seems to be nice,

451
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,600
and his regard dog is nice as well.

452
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,700
Okay, let's go inside the church then.

453
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,600
Head in sign.

454
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,700
Examine the chair.

455
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm examining so hard right now.

456
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,700
As much as I love to stay and watch little Inge play,

457
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,700
I have to have some rest so I can be able to work tonight.

458
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,400
I hope you have a good day and fun with the reflings.

459
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,700
And guys, look after her, please.

460
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,600
Aw, thank you, typical Mason.

461
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,400
All reflings look after me.

462
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,700
Okay, hello chair.

463
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,900
I believe I can feed brewing.

464
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,200
Mmm, yeah, it's brewing.

465
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,900
This evening is a sign of a greater night to come.

466
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,000
Mm-hmm.

467
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,200
Study sorcery?

468
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
If you want the greater,

469
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,700
it's south of the Recluses River downstream,

470
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,200
gray south of the church.

471
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,000
Ask about Gunson's sorcery.

472
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,200
Ask about the nature of the world.

473
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,000
Sure, why not?

474
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,300
I hear that you have borne witness to the whole of it.

475
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,100
The conceits, the hypocrisy of the world

476
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,800
built upon the earth tree.

477
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,300
Is there no hope for a de-answer?

478
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,700
There never was any hope.

479
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,800
They were each of them defected, Marika herself.

480
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,100
Okay, right, wrap it up.

481
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,100
Wrap it up.

482
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,600
What?

483
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,400
You need to reload the area.

484
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,000
He needs to disappear.

485
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,400
Rest well.

486
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,300
He needs to disappear.

487
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:20,200
Like, come from here and run up to the church.

488
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
I will run up to the church.

489
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Yes, then examine his chair.

490
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,000
Uncle.

491
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,200
Pop me on a horse.

492
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,300
And then the church is this.

493
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,000
Not this.

494
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Oh, it's actually this.

495
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,800
Oh, the path.

496
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,400
Oh, you know that really obvious path

497
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
that leads up to the church?

498
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,900
Yeah, that one.

499
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,100
Peace off, ghost.

500
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,300
Elden Ring is so sad.

501
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,800
You never, like, get a break from any fighting at all.

502
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,700
They're so mean.

503
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,400
They're so stinky.

504
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,900
I could have picked up materials there.

505
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,200
I didn't even have a moment to think.

506
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,900
I think you could.

507
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,900
I think you have to exhaust his dialogue for him to disappear.

508
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,300
Oh, I.

509
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:14,300
I come on tour and let's go inside the church.

510
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,300
What is that random?

511
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,700
Oh, it's the sunset.

512
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,500
I was like, why is there random lanes on the church floor?

513
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,000
What does it mean?

514
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Is it like salt?

515
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,500
All Elden Rings characters have sad back stories.

516
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,700
What is this, Warhammer?

517
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,800
Oh, for folks sake, he's still here.

518
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,900
Peace off, ghost.

519
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,400
Right, you.

520
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,600
Right, right, right, right, right, right.

521
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Right, right, right, right, right.

522
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,900
Lore, yes, juicy lore.

523
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,500
Look, I just want to play with the refluence.

524
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,400
I said what I said.

525
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,100
Study sorcery.

526
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,500
Oh, my God.

527
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,200
Oh, that's so cool.

528
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,700
Glenstone.

529
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,600
Oh, yes, Glenstone.

530
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,500
Mm, yes.

531
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,600
Oh, greater world, greater world.

532
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Yes, look.

533
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,300
Ask about makeup.

534
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,600
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

535
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:51,900
Yes.

536
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,300
Oh, my God.

537
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,700
Yes, filled with pleasure.

538
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,400
Lovely.

539
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,600
Jay-Z Lee, thank you.

540
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,800
We need a mother.

541
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,100
That's why I'm called Mummy.

542
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:16,000
Right, that to me sounds like a cheeky exhausted dialogue.

543
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Okay, now rest at the grace site until night.

544
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Oh, okay.

545
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,000
Yeah, I can do that.

546
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,600
Hold up.

547
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,300
Opening up.

548
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,200
I have sprite today because I don't know what's wrong with me too,

549
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,000
mate.

550
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,400
Is he still in that chair?

551
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,200
Oh, yeah.

552
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
He's no in the chair.

553
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,000
Right, now to analyze this chair.

554
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,300
What was so special about this chair?

555
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,300
Let us discover together.

556
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,700
Hmm, examine.

557
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,700
Oh, my.

558
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,200
Oh, there's a wee, a wee knob on it.

559
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,100
Oh, I do love pushing a good knob.

560
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:52,400
Oh, I'd say hydration.

561
00:20:52,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Oh, see, sometimes in life, the answer is just to give a knob a good push.

562
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,900
I don't know why you're the dark, deep hole.

563
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,800
I'm sure this won't freak me out at all.

564
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,900
Surely I can summon you guys at the bottom of the ladder, right?

565
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,800
Right, you guys are here, right?

566
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,600
No, I can't do anything.

567
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,300
Okay, that's fine.

568
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,300
I like adventuring alone.

569
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,500
No, it's my favorite thing.

570
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,600
The secret gun cave under the throne.

571
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,100
Real.

572
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,900
No, I love.

573
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,500
I love.

574
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Oh, okay, okay.

575
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:34,900
All right.

576
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,900
Remember how to play, right?

577
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,200
Roll.

578
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
Oh, is that a heavy roll?

579
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,700
That looks like a medium roll to me, right?

580
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,600
Okay.

581
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,100
What can I do from afar?

582
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,500
Uh, nothing.

583
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,100
Right, I have, I have 11 heals.

584
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,800
Oh, any blood loss?

585
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,200
Me a bam.

586
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,000
Fucking low poise motherfucker.

587
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,800
Get out of here.

588
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,900
Don't do that move again.

589
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,300
Hold on.

590
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,000
I need hydrate.

591
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,300
No, don't do that.

592
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,200
Don't get me blood loss.

593
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,900
You, you think you, you wait for you.

594
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,000
No, stop it.

595
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,700
You have higher agility than me.

596
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,900
That's cheating.

597
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,200
Hold on.

598
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,700
Let me hydrate.

599
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,800
Hold on.

600
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,200
Yeah.

601
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Fuck you bitch.

602
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,300
Take that you poise poise poise.

603
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:18,700
Yeah.

604
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,500
No poise for you.

605
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,100
Fuck you.

606
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:22,700
Oh shit.

607
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,000
No poise for me.

608
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,400
No agility and no endurance.

609
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,000
Hydrate and back off.

610
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,500
Oh, yeah.

611
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
That cheeky roll.

612
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,000
No, don't take blood loss.

613
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,500
Wait.

614
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,700
What are you fucking?

615
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,700
No, let me back in.

616
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,900
Let me, no, put me back in.

617
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,500
I had that.

618
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:41,800
Sorry.

619
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,200
I had that.

620
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,900
I got greedy.

621
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,800
I got greedy.

622
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,300
I got greedy.

623
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,100
Put me back in.

624
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,100
Actual, put me back in.

625
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,400
No, then he'd be giving me leaving hostile signs.

626
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,500
Put me back in chief.

627
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,400
I had that.

628
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,200
No, put me back in.

629
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,400
Right.

630
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:53,800
Hold on.

631
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,000
Right.

632
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,100
I'm holding two hand in it.

633
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,200
Right.

634
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,600
Put me back in.

635
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,600
Into the goon cave we go.

636
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,300
Mm-hmm.

637
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:01,800
Mm-hmm.

638
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,200
Mm-hmm.

639
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,600
Mm-hmm.

640
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,200
Mm-hmm.

641
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,500
Mm-hmm.

642
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,000
Put me back in.

643
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,500
That was the easiest fight in my life.

644
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,000
Watch your stamina.

645
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Watch your mouth race when I'll plug.

646
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,300
I'll put something in it to keep you quiet.

647
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:13,800
Right.

648
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,900
Back into the goon cave.

649
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,000
I can't believe there's a fucking goon cave defender.

650
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,500
Seriously.

651
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,000
Right.

652
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,100
Come.

653
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,400
Fight me.

654
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,200
Binch.

655
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,400
Do it.

656
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,100
You got this.

657
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,400
Easy.

658
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,000
No, I do.

659
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,500
Easy.

660
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,400
Literally goon cave.

661
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:30,700
Right.

662
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,100
Spawn in.

663
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,500
You be right.

664
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
Fuck you.

665
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,200
Bitch.

666
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
Are you fucking serious?

667
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
I just hit that.

668
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,200
I dodged.

669
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Oh.

670
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
Oh.

671
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,400
Are you fucking serious?

672
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
I need hydrate.

673
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,700
I need hydrate.

674
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,100
Oh my god.

675
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,800
I'm getting sunblocked.

676
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,400
And I don't have any.

677
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,000
Fuck off.

678
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,600
Let me hydrate.

679
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,900
Fuck off.

680
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,100
Yeah.

681
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,500
Fuck you.

682
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,200
Poise bitch.

683
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,400
Yeah.

684
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,200
Nice try.

685
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,800
Try again.

686
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,400
I dare you.

687
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,000
Try again.

688
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,500
I dare you.

689
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:12,900
I dare you.

690
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,500
Come close.

691
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,200
Fuck you.

692
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,700
Oh.

693
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:15,900
Oh yeah.

694
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,400
Piss.

695
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:16,600
Oh yeah.

696
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:16,900
Piss.

697
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,800
That's cheating.

698
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,900
No, it's too early in the morning for this.

699
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,500
Too early in the morning.

700
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:22,700
Yeah.

701
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,400
You're not the only thing I'm shitting on.

702
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,500
You're not the only thing I'm shitting.

703
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,100
Ooh.

704
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,800
Ooh.

705
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,100
Ooh.

706
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,800
Blood loss.

707
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,100
Blood loss.

708
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,500
Get.

709
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,300
Don't get cocky.

710
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,900
Eh.

711
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,700
Defend this.

712
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,600
Oh.

713
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,300
She's no dead yet.

714
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:39,600
No.

715
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,200
Don't freaking cock up.

716
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,100
Don't cock up.

717
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,000
Don't cock it.

718
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,800
Don't cock it up.

719
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,500
Don't cock up.

720
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,900
Oh my God.

721
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,400
Oh.

722
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:49,700
All right.

723
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,100
Hold on.

724
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:50,600
Hold on.

725
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,200
Hold on a minute.

726
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,800
Hold on a minute.

727
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,900
Stop.

728
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,500
Let me get this.

729
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,400
Oh.

730
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,100
Let me get this right.

731
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,300
My fellow Americans.

732
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,000
I have the highest fucking poise in the game.

733
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,600
I have heavy, heavy armor.

734
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,500
Heavy, heavy armor.

735
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,100
And I'm the one who gets sunlocked by we fucking needle.

736
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,400
Right.

737
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,800
Okay.

738
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,000
Apparently needle.

739
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,300
I hate needles apparently.

740
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:08,700
Okay.

741
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,000
Right.

742
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,700
Let's try that again.

743
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,800
Shhh.

744
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,300
No.

745
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,400
What do you mean I can't just summon reflans to do every single fight

746
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,600
so I can enjoy the game for what it is?

747
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,000
What do you mean?

748
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,600
I can't just do that.

749
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,200
Honestly.

750
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,300
Short on behavior.

No.

753
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,900

764
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400

765
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,280
Can I just can I say it's the lag because I'm in Australia?

797
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,720
That was an insight thought that came out. I'm guessing since this is a fey

798
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,620
Is there a point in summoning in an evil reefing?

799
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,360

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:02,080

847
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,880

853
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,680
Oh, wait, wait, how did I do the microphone? No, not the microphone. How did I do it back?

854
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,680

Thank you for your service, I'm sorry you died

858
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,720
That was a freaky boss. I like that. Well, like it was a very unique boss

859
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,320
I like the attack pattern on it as well like the wee bombs that laid down. I'm a rest

860
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:14,960
Can I level up? No, but I have a rado shell best thing. Oh, okay. Nice try. It's a could

864
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,720
Okay, I don't

865
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,880
Where are we?

866
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Where do I go from here?

867
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:44,520
Or is this a teleport out kind of location? It looks like a teleport out location. I just think I'm

868
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,840
I don't think it's about to be here

869
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,600
That refund will be remembered for the what sadly these bosses are made for both close scores and range combat

870
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,600
Which makes you think on your feet

871
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,200
You should get all your blessings to max. How did I do that?

872
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,120
Skadoo tree is actually pronounced Shadoo tree

873
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,400
And now I'm your worthy ally in battle. Oh

874
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,480

876
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,000
Shibbity

877
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,720
You need all the shibbity fragments. Okay, where'd I go?

878
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,960
Oh

879
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,400
What you thought I was gonna know what to do. No, I've never played this before

880
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,200
And what's that you're gonna carry me every step of the way damn straight you are. This is the way we play video games around these parts

881
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,400
from around here

882
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,080

883
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:47,560
Right if I upgrade my weapons, can I go back to the guy in the not dlc?

884
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:54,040
Explore or fight a boss. I don't know. They said I should level up my thingy my bobber

885
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:03,160
My shadow realm blessings if I remember correctly the blessing raises my defense against the enemies or something

00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:12,200
Smithing master huig. Yeah. Aye that right. Okay. We'll go to the round table and I'll see what happens

887
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:22,280
I thought I had to go bomb. Yeah like this. Okay. I'll go to master big hui

888
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:29,960

It's you. Hi

894
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,600
It's not important

895
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:57,720
There should be a smith in the dlc as a quality of life thing. I thought I think there's no new interaction at the church. Ah

896
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,120
Uh strengthen me weapon. How'd I do that?

897

Great sword of solitude

898
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,240
Sombra smithing stone

899

Okay, I'm out of smithing stones. Okay, and then can I do my weed for an arrow? That's op

00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:32,840

00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,800
With that you guys told that you gave me

00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,680

912
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:12,280
Right memory of grace you can get switched out for the coconut. It's so important that I can moan in the reason that you're

I did really well. I just didn't know how to like overwhelm the

998
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,680

1003
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:55,240
Immeasurable pain my body's in from the ring fit stream yesterday. It wasn't even that bad. I don't know what that motor is

1004
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,600

Most irreparably. Oh my god. I'm being blessed

1011
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,480
Blessing. Oh my god. Fuck your poise, bitch

1012
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,440
Fuck your poise

1013
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,880
I have so much poise. It's so big and juicy

1014
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,680
All of it all of us just crashing on her. This is so fun

1015
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:45,080
I don't know why they don't just make an actual official multiplayer. Sorry, this would be so fun

1016
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,840
Oh who died reefling

00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:59,160
Reefling wait, what oh, no, sorry. Sorry the notification made it look like a reefling died

1018
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,680
You're a man. You can't be a mother

1019
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,600
No, you can't be

1020
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,240
You have a pentas. That's illegal

1021
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,040
Whoa, I didn't really mean to jump in the middle of that but hold on. Let me hydrate

1022
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,200
Okay, sorry, I got a bit overzealous that was me

1023
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,720
I do excuse me. I got excited there

1024
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,400
No, no hands or arrows. Okay, that wasn't hands or arrows. That doesn't count

1025
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:37,800
Fuck your poise. God, he like casts bells so quickly

1026
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:43,320
Oh, we did it. We did it. We did it. See proof I need reeflings at all times

1027
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,880
Ymir's bell bearing

1028
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:53,640
A staff, a high priest hat, a high priest robe, a high priest balloon, a high priest undergurn

1029
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,480
We did it

1030
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,440
Might I suggest a quick detail maxing out the flask upgrades could be useful in the future and it shouldn't take too long

1031
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:05,480
But those two ranks could make a difference at some point the flying conquerors

1032
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:11,960
The flasks. I don't use my wonders physique if I'm being honest controversial, but I never use it

1033
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,720
I'm a bad player

1034
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,040
So now can I touch it without being

1035
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:26,120
I assume it just opens the pathway again. Is there something new down here?

1036
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:32,520
No, I mean a healing flask. They mean your health. Oh, you mean I can abuse the healing even more

1037
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,400
So there's just nothing down here anymore

1038
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,240
That just was the secret. Okay. We did it. We did it

1039
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:48,760
It goes up to 12 Ymir's robes have a secret if you alter them. Ooh

1040
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,520
Remember that time people were complaining that you can't play the game without knowing everything

1041
00:49:54,600 --> 00:50:00,520
Like having to look it up online and I was like, honestly, can I agree go to shadow keep shadow keep

00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:15,160
Who wants to be the naughty refling? Hmm who wants to be the big bad man?

1056
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,880
Hmm

1057

It's a boss fight. We're here. Haven't we not already done it?

00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,680
Why are you naked you took off your clothes so oh

You really are dragon. Hi refling. No, don't be sorry

I don't know why that crossbow is going so high

1201
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:30,840
I mean, I think I'm barely fucking doing one in this weird bathroom. No

1206
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,760
And nothing more. This is terrible

1207
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,600

01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:49,720
Okay, I do 700 with my sword. That's not bad. Honestly. That's really advantageous. That's good to know

1219

There's like this parody tick tock that count

1273
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:08,040
That's like strength players have it so easy

1274

01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,880

01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,960
Oh, I'm gonna take it though my critical hit

1285
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:04,200
Yikes or that per animal. That's not fair on him

1286
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:10,520
I feel really bad for him. He's just doing what his master tells them

1287
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,800
Hold on. I'm out of mana

1288
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,240
Sure, I'll take this

1289
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,440
Why did it go come for me?

1290
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:25,400
I almost come for me in that move. All right, hold on. Let me hydrate

1291
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,360
I

1292
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,320
Okay, no, let me attack

1293
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,200
No, let me attack

1294
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,280
Okay, use my ult

1295
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,520
Did I hit it? I think it is

1296
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:42,920
Ah

1297
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,920
I forget how long the lines is

1298
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,640
in the in the midst of a fate

1299
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:53,800
I've actually done so much more of this like little distance sword attack

1300
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,640
I'm like, I don't want to speck into magic though

1301
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,760
I feel like that's not me

1302
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:04,200
Like I like taking a big wall up out to someone and breaking their poise

1303
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:09,560
Like I find it really satisfying when the enemy stops attacking me because I've broken them

1304
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,520
Oh, you got a critical. I'll do it. Oh, I was too late

1305
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:21,640
Oh, oh my god, easy peasy first try we did on our first try. Oh, yeah

Easy peasy. Let me squeeze you

1309
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:39,880
Accept your role become a magic. I kind of feel like I should honestly if I'm just to stand back so much

1310
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,760
Uh, right what now?

1311
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,440
Oh, there's something over there. I see it

1312
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,360
We've never been here before

1313
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,960
Okay, let's go to this grease site and then

1314
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:03,000
Or is there already a fight past this? I wouldn't put it past the game to be like, um, yes a fight right here

Wow, that's a big castello big many years to build many many

1321
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,840
Although many hands make light work or whatever it is. They say

1337
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,160

1351
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:22,520
Just because of what happened before stream started

1352
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,400

1360
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,000

1361
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,600
um

1362
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,600
I'm not sure what to do

1363
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:18,600
There's an enemy inside the summit that we didn't do will we do him?

1364
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:27,480
Dark chamber entrance has a boss dark chamber entrance

1365
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:31,160
Dark chamber enterons

1366
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:36,040
Any dark chamber enterers look at me for real for real

1367
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:39,960
Dark chamber entry deep dark

1368
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:43,960
Dark have I not unlocked it? I don't think I've unlocked that

1369
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,520
I just look

01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,920

1371
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,920
And the name of the Nord's I pray to the Lord's

1372
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:57,240
At the top where you are. Wait, there's something here. Show me

01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,920
This this way no, that's where I came from

1374
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:14,120
I have to be probably second most annoying boss. I'm satisfied. It's your dark chamber. No dark chamber in dark chamber entrance

1375
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,120
That castle near you

1376
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,400
Oh, okay, and now what?

1377
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,880

01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:35,160
Oh, you mean you mean behind that portal, huh? Yeah, I wonder if there's a boss behind here

01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,560
I didn't have we already attempted it

1380
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:43,480
What's the bot? Oh my god, I love you reflings. Thank you for one to play with me. Holy shit

1381
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,360
um

1382
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:50,040
I'm just gonna make sure no everyone gets a chance

1383
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,280
I

1384
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,920
Write your name down on my wee piece of paper

1385
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,400
You've not had a shot either

1386
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:05,320
Thank you for wanting to play with me. Uh, it makes me very happy. Okay, not to get too staffy. Okay. It makes me happy

1387
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:13,240
I like being able to play games. Yeah, and even though I know I'm probably really if you do genuinely like are like really into

1388
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,360
Elden Ring, I'm probably the worst person to watch

1389
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,320
And play it because I'm just like

1390
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:26,680
Um, right what boss is behind here? I don't remember a boss behind here

1391
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Oh, why would you do that?

1392
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,360
Roofling, why would you do that?

1393
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,920
I'm not ready

1394
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,400
I'm not ready

1395
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,640
Roofling, why would you do that?

1396
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:45,240
Oh my god, I am not ready

1397
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:49,480
You little thing you refling

1398
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,600
Oh

1399
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:58,280
I don't recall. I don't recall any of the moves

1400
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:01,880
I don't remember a thing

1401
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:06,280
Hey, he doesn't even have poise breaking things

1402
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:10,040
Am I going mental and he just spams

1403
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:20,120
You're so stinky. Oh, there's just a little boss behind here. Oh, yeah, just a wee one. I just a wee boss. I just a wee a wee boss

1404
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:25,320
Bruh, we aren't even going to get to the snake stage right

1405
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:29,720
I'm going to have to lock in to try and remember his attack patterns. Oh, I should have been in that trap

1406
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:36,040
Oh my goodness right, hold on. What was I don't know what my flask does well take it

1407
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:40,520
I mean, I can't do that. Is that even going to hit him? No, I'm too far away

1408
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,360
Oh my god, I forgot. Wait, let me watch see the trans

1409
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:47,320
uh, the trans changing thing

1410
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,960
From one thing to another

1411
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:52,360
Transition there you go

1412
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,960
I've not seen it since obviously the last time we played

1413
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,920
What does he do

1414
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,920
To change

1415
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,600
He's a snake a sneaky snake

1416
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:09,880
No, mother

1417
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,280
Figure it for me

1418
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:17,160
There seems to be a lot of mummy issues going on in the dlc. Oh, not to be eyeball

1419
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:21,320
Hey, don't don't don't pop it out. You keep that eyeball

1420
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:35,160
Pop goes the eyeball

1421
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,160
Pop goes his eyeball

1422
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:52,440
And now he becomes a sneaky snake

1423
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:01,800
His grape of frenzy he popped his ball just to become a snake

1424
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:06,600
Oh my god, give him- Mommy, please forgive me, mommy, for I have sinned.

1425
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,200
I can't even remember.

1426
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,600
Ooh, he looks mad.

1427
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:30,280
Of the abyssal serpent, shorn of light.

1428
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,120
He's like me, I have worms for brains too.

1429
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:43,160
I don't recall a single thing. I do not recall a single thing.

1430
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:51,800
Okay, he's extra agile. I'll give him that, extra agile. Let me just give him a good old

1431
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:59,000
tallywax so I can see I hurt him. Oh, there's a good reflin, good boy reflin. Keep it up.

1432
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:04,280
Oh, you're such a well-behaved boy. Keep going. Show him a good time. Oh, that's right.

1433
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:11,640
Mommy's so proud. Keep it up. Mommy's really proud. You can do it. You can carry me on

1434
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:18,840
down this wall. I'm helping, I'm helping. I just not go far enough. Oh!

1435
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:29,880
Oh, I had a one-shot bubble on me that protects me. Okay, fuck it, I'm going in.

1436
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:33,640
I'm not, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out,

1437
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:40,200
pull out, pull out, a bore, a bore. Okay, I have more art war now.

1438
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:52,600
Stop wiggling. There you go. Stop wiggling. Out. Oh my gosh, he does so much that. I'm like,

1439
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:58,360
how do you guys survive for so long? You already have like the, the thing

1440
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:05,320
against you that makes things this harder. Oh my god, please don't die now, reflin.

1441
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:10,520
I love you. Please stay up for mommy. Mommy's scared. Mommy's really scared right now.

1442
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:14,680
Please. Am I helping? I think I am.

1443
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:26,600
I just need to not die. Copy. Copy. Oh my god, reflin. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god, you can do it.

1444
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:30,680
You can do it. You can kill him and keep me alive at the same time.

1445
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:38,360
I believe in you, refling. I'm staying away. Out. I don't, okay, maybe I shouldn't stay away?

1446
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:43,400
I don't know. Fuck it. I'm, I'm just going to cheer from the side lanes. You can do it.

1447
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:54,920
I believe in you. You can do it. You go, refling, refling. You did it.

1448
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:08,440
A curse upon thee. Oh wait, he just cursed. Why? Oh my god. Mesmer's kindling? What does he kindle?

1449
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:17,720
Give me a healing stone. Thank you. Oh, you're like, oh, your watch is over. Oh my gosh. You guys

1450
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:23,960
have fucking upgraded. What was Mesmer's thingy, my boba? Or was it not that well I picked up?

1451
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:29,720
No, I guess not. Beloved starter. What does it do though? I don't know. Why did I just take

1452
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:35,560
off to do that as well? Oh god. Someone's not being paying attention. Yeah, well,

1453
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:45,240
sure. That reflin was a Slavic chad. Oh, chad, sorry.

1454
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:53,080
Oh my gosh. Okay, I'm going for a sleepy at the rest of the day so I can get all my things back.

1455
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:58,360
You guys are fucking MLG though. What's this? Am I supposed to read something over here?

1456
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:10,040
No, definitely not. Read message. I did it. I did it. That was fun. Thanks, mommy. Why are you

1457
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:18,760
thanking me? You carried me. Why are you saying thank you to me? It's all you. Where did I go?

1458
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:25,320
It's pointing this way. Thank you, no, Alessandro, for the moony money.

1459
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,960
Dad, I need to summon you in here to take me where to go next.

1460
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:39,320
This is a furl... Oh, sorry. Didn't see that. What are you? Hello.

1461
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:42,120
What cruelty is this? I'm not sure.

1462
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:53,080
Rather than my one vital purpose, how I saw fevered, worthless, dull, uplaid that vengeance

1463
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:58,280
was never to have been my... Oh no, he was the one that wanted to kill Bill. Oh, I'm sorry, mate.

1464
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:02,120
It was me. It was that reflin over there. Him over there.

1465
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:09,960
Almost cherished wife. Child. It seems vengeance was not mine to enact.

1466
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:16,200
You didn't summon him, are you sad? Tired blade. I'm not, like, corrupted my game, though, no.

1467
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:21,240
Where now should I point my tire? Look, your enemy's defeated. You're welcome.

1468
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:30,200
Shouldn't have said it. Okay, I can't seem to summon you guys in here, so I guess we go elsewhere?

1469
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:42,440
Uh, now you have to fate him later. Jagged Peek Summit. A body hook not.

1470
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:46,200
When you say I have to fate him later, you mean you, right? You mean you?

1471
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:50,520
Yeah, you're gonna be fainting him later. Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

1472
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:56,760
He's my handsome little refling. He's a good boy. Are you gonna fate for mommy?

1473
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,400
Yeah, you're gonna make me proud on the battle field.

1474
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:04,200
Yes, I can reflin to you. Is it it?

1475
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:11,960
Who's fainting for me this time? You. You're at the start. I'll just make sure there's no new.

1476
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:14,200
Okay, Galavan, we always knew.

1477
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:23,480
I will do a whole praise audio ASMR right now. If we defeat the DLC in one day, you're getting a praise

1478
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:34,680
audio. Just fight Bale at Jagged. Wait, Bale shows up here? He's that mad at me?

1479
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:39,160
I'm sorry, big Bale. We're like...

1480
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:44,040
You're getting a moan.

1481
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:51,720
Could you imagine if I could do a roly-poly right on your tentacle? That would be pretty mental.

1482
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:59,960
Hello. Oh, you've got a coconut weapon. Look. It looks like a glintstone coconut.

1483
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:06,120
Are you ready? Well, mommy and Rufan's on your head. Thank you for hanging.

1484
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:14,040
Okay, taint to destroy some things. I forgot every fate. I just know there's something big and bad behind.

1485
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:27,160
Oh, yeah, he doesn't have his wee wings. He has, like, sticks. Oh, per guy.

1486
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,640
What is the dragon without his wings?

1487
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,400
Oh, he doesn't have a leg either?

1488
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:43,640
Is there, like, a benefits system in this, like, area? I feel like he needs, like,

1489
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:47,000
there's no way he can make an income for himself. How is he gonna make food?

1490
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:51,480
Like, he needs to go with the lobster shack and stuff.

1491
01:26:55,800 --> 01:27:02,360
Is it hot in here? I'm not sure why. Oh, my gosh. I feel really bad for him.

1492
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:12,040
Summon Igon? How'd I do that? Is he at the door? Sorry. Well, it's the Riefling's

1493
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:21,400
fight for their lives. Igon. Igon, where are you? Igon, are you at the door? I think you are.

1494
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:24,840
Okay, let me get him.

1495
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:37,240
Oh, he does have wings. Okay, someone's looking for, you, keep up, reflets, you're doing great.

1496
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:43,960
I'm just looking for a gold sign. I'm looking, I'm just looking. I'm brosing, I'm brosing the

1497
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:55,000
catalog. Where the fuck? Am I going mental? Have I seen it? Gotta use his finger in your

1498
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:01,000
inventory? Right, Riefling, you keep it up. I've got, I've got fingers. In my inventory? Right,

1499
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:08,040
a finger. Igon, Igon. Like this? No. What? What's the, what's the thing called?

1500
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:17,240
No, you don't use it from inventory. Did we just kill it? Oh, you didn't do the quest?

1501
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,640
Whoops, question mark.

1502
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:25,560
I tell the, you can't summon him if you don't do his quest. You either have the finger or you're

1503
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:32,280
doing, so am I, are we killing him or not? Did we come back? I mean, the Rieflings are

1504
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:35,400
kind of smoking him. I'm not going to lie. Did I tell the Rieflings to stop?

1505
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:39,320
Extra only working hard during this one. Literally, I'm fucking about in my inventory

1506
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:41,080
while the Rieflings are absolutely decimating him.

1507
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:49,400
You, you're killing him. Kill him, kill him. Go, no, keep going. Right, keep going, Rieflings.

1508
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:57,320
Keep going. Mummy's so proud of you. Keep it up. You're doing amazing. Go, go, go, go. Destroy him.

1509
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:06,040
I'm helping too. I'm helping too. Look, see him coming over. See me losing all of my stamina

1510
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:12,520
before I get close? That's my super awesome move. It's my best move. I call it losing stamina every

1511
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:18,200
second. Please don't fly so I can get one hit in, please. I've literally not done a single bit of

1512
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:27,080
damage. Right, hold on. Okay, I missed. And he's gone. Uh, oh, and he's back. No, stop. Can you

1513
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:34,120
target his leg or something? Oh, there's his little, little meaty leg. I think I did 700 damage.

1514
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:44,600
You're welcome. You're welcome. I did 700 damage. Oh, he came in like a Riefling. No, we've lost one.

1515
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:51,400
I'm running, running, and running, running. I'm out of stamina in like a second.

1516
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:59,240
How did you dodge? Oh, you didn't. Sorry. Bro, I can't get close enough to kill.

1517
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:07,400
Stop it. Leave my Riefling alone. He didn't mean it. It was a misinput. Oh, no, I'm on my own.

1518
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:16,280
Oh, no. Please, please don't embarrass me. Please don't embarrass me. No, he's 1 HP. Please, please.

1519
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:21,560
Don't, please. Don't, please let me heal. Please let me heal. Please let me heal, please let me heal.

1520
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:27,560
Right, I healed, I healed, I healed. This is embarrassing. This is embarrassing. Hold on. I need one

1521
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:33,320
hit. Okay, he walked away. That's fine. He's allowed to do that. This is embarrassing. This is embarrassing.

1522
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:36,820
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on!

1523
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:49,320
Mmm, mmm, mmm-hmm.

1524
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:57,320
Mmm-hmm, mmm, mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

1525
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:01,320
I was lagging, I was, I was lagging all over.

1526
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:02,320
Did you not see that lag?

1527
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:07,320
Right, Jimmy, if this breaks, I think your console just hates me.

1528
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,320
Is anyone?

1529
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:11,320
Grats, gee, you've not had a chance.

1530
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:14,320
I am so sorry, Reflins, that did that fey.

1531
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,320
I am so fucking sorry.

1532
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:19,320
I am so sorry.

1533
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:22,320
I mean, I did do 700 damage.

1534
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:25,320
I hit him once, so I did my part.

1535
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:27,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

1536
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:29,320
Oh, you made it, you can connect.

1537
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:31,320
Okay, Reflins, are you ready?

1538
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,320
Oh my God, what are you wearing?

1539
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,320
Oh my God, it's so late.

1540
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,320
Right, you have been blessed.

1541
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:42,320
Okay, now, you need to do what the other team just did,

1542
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,320
where I get to sit and do nothing.

1543
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,320
Okay, whilst I was mucking about my inventory.

1544
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,320
Alright?

1545
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:49,320
Okay, okay.

1546
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:53,320
Good news is you can go find Aegon.

1547
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:54,320
Oh, should we?

1548
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:55,320
Oh, go do the quest.

1549
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:56,320
Oh wait, sorry, Reflins.

1550
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,320
Right, come take me to the quest instead.

1551
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,320
Right, where do I go for the quest?

1552
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:03,320
Come, Reflins, come.

1553
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,320
Where does it start?

1554
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:09,320
That's the question.

1555
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,320
So this is what the map is unlocked.

1556
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,320
I have a really itchy fucking nose right now.

1557
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:18,320
I've been like itching it and nothing is making it less itchy.

1558
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:25,320
Bottom of the mountain, kill two dragons at the bottom of the mountain.

1559
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,320
At the jagged peak mountain side?

1560
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:31,320
Need your horse, so might do solo.

1561
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:37,320
I need to fight a boss on my own.

1562
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:40,320
Right, so as Reflins come back, so as I'm not fighting on my own, fuck that.

1563
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:41,320
No.

1564
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,320
One Reflin just fell off.

1565
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:48,320
No, I'm not.

1566
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:50,320
No, I've had to fight on my own.

1567
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:51,320
No, get shagged.

1568
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:56,320
Sorry, Aegon can, Aegon piss off because I'm not doing it.

1569
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,320
Grats, do you want to put down your sign again?

1570
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:03,320
I don't know if I can get you Grats.

1571
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:07,320
No, you can summon for the boss.

1572
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,320
Oh wait, I can summon for the boss.

1573
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,320
Oh, you don't have to fight them, right?

1574
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:22,320
Okay, Jimmy, I know you just connected, but can you not be here and then...

1575
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:23,320
No, just disconnect with the furl-

1576
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:24,320
Don't jump off!

1577
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,320
Why do you always go Reflins?

1578
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,320
Is there something going on?

1579
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:32,320
Why do we always go straight for imminent death whenever I need you to leave?

1580
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:37,320
You never use the furled finger, so it's just imminent death.

1581
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,320
Okay, right.

1582
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,320
I go...

1583
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:47,320
I let it disconnect, and then I go down to the mountainside.

1584
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:49,320
It's that Mummy doesn't want me.

1585
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:52,320
Mummy doesn't want me, what's the point?

1586
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:55,320
Right, I'll take your names off the list because you didn't even get a fight.

1587
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:57,320
Right, I'm at the jagged peak.

1588
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:58,320
I'm on my horse.

1589
01:33:58,320 --> 01:33:59,320
Now what?

1590
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:05,320
Jagged peak base.

1591
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,320
Jagged peak base?

1592
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,320
Wait, I don't know where-

1593
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:12,320
I'm not- I didn't even find the base, apparently.

1594
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:15,320
Bro, I can't find your base, where the fuck is it?

1595
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,320
Where did I go?

1596
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,320
You can't summon for this, wait.

1597
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:25,320
Left, left, okay.

1598
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:29,320
Inside the hole?

1599
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:31,320
It's to the west.

1600
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,320
Outside or inside the mountain?

1601
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,320
Inside, okay.

1602
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,320
Inside the hole, got it.

1603
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:42,320
Wait a minute.

1604
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:46,320
I ran away from this boss.

1605
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,320
I ran away.

1606
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:52,320
You said the two dragons fight each other?

1607
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,320
They better.

1608
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,320
I swear they better.

1609
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,320
I swear they better start fighting each other.

1610
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,320
Right, wakey, wakey.

1611
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:07,320
Oh my god, it's got sacks in its name.

1612
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:09,320
Right, and where's the second dragon?

1613
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:10,320
Wrong dragon?

1614
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:13,320
What do you mean wrong dragon?

1615
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:15,320
Oh my gosh.

1616
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:18,320
Is it here?

1617
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:21,320
Who's the right dragon?

1618
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,320
Well, I'm out of range, okay?

1619
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,320
I'm out of range, I don't have to deal with it.

1620
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:31,320
Where- who's the other dragon?

1621
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:33,320
Ooh, shiny red thing.

1622
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:35,320
Am I being chased?

1623
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:37,320
I think I'm being chased.

1624
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:39,320
I'm being chased, something's going on behind me.

1625
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:41,320
Oh yeah, I'm not turning around so it's not my problem.

1626
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:43,320
Right, I'm turning around a wee bit now.

1627
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,320
It's left of the mountain.

1628
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,320
You went to the midpoint?

1629
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,320
This isn't the right way.

1630
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:58,320
Not the equivalent to a pillow princess.

1631
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:01,320
Excuse me, pillow princess is best if you play this game.

1632
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:05,320
This isn't where I was supposed to go.

1633
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,320
You can't summon for the fight, the dragons will fight each other,

1634
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,320
but one of them is much stronger.

1635
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:14,320
You will likely have to fight one on your own.

1636
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:18,320
Right, so because of that, for no particular reason,

1637
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,320
put your thing down at Jagged Peak Summit.

1638
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:28,320
For no particular reason, we're gonna skip that quest.

1639
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:31,320
No particular reason.

1640
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,320
Okay, who hasn't...

1641
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:37,320
Takum, you were at the start.

1642
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:39,320
Jimmy, you never had a shot, right, go.

1643
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:40,320
And then...

1644
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,320
Grat Zed, are you here?

1645
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,320
Oh, I named you!

1646
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,320
That's your gamer tag!

1647
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,320
I'm gonna see if Zed...

1648
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,320
Okay, Grat Zed, you're here.

1649
01:36:58,320 --> 01:36:59,320
And Jimmy...

1650
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:01,320
Wait, am I being dumb?

1651
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,320
Did I not write anyone's name down?

1652
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,320
What the fuck?

1653
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:13,320
It's better if Aegon dies in agony than shame.

1654
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:16,320
I'm the best Elden Ring player ever.

1655
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:17,320
What are you talking about?

1656
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:20,320
The only reason I'm good is because you guys helped me.

1657
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:23,320
But I'm literally MLG, like, every fight I've already deaths me.

1658
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:25,320
It's like, sorry, look how far I got.

1659
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:27,320
What do you mean Elden Ring's easiest game?

1660
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:29,320
Elden Ring's easiest game?

1661
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:31,320
I'm summoning the Dark Souls.

1662
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,320
Okay, good for Dark Souls, I guess.

1663
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:35,320
Right, go!

1664
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:37,320
Go fight, Reflins!

1665
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:38,320
Fight, fight, fight!

1666
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,320
Who will be crowned the champion?

1667
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,320
Someone says you can summon for the Drake Soul.

1668
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,320
I'm getting...

1669
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:49,320
I'm getting misleading information.

1670
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:50,320
What's going on here?

1671
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:52,320
Okay, I rolled right into that, my bad, chief.

1672
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:57,320
I couldn't beat the first boss.

1673
01:37:57,320 --> 01:37:59,320
This is really hard!

1674
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,320
Go Reflins, go!

1675
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:02,320
Go Reflins, go!

1676
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:05,320
I'm providing emotional support.

1677
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,320
This will be your reward when you win.

1678
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:10,320
This is your reward.

1679
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:15,320
I'll make you sound like that through any means necessary.

1680
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,320
At the grace I can summon them in.

1681
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:22,320
You can summon players, but you can summon spirit ashes down there.

1682
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,320
Okay.

1683
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,320
Yeah, very contradicting, Reflins.

1684
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:31,320
One says something, one says the other.

1685
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:32,320
We don't know!

1686
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,320
You can summon.

1687
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:34,320
We're bickering!

1688
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,320
The Reflins are fighting!

1689
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:37,320
I'm cheering them on!

1690
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:38,320
Go Reflins, go!

1691
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:39,320
Okay, this...

1692
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:44,320
This duo don't seem to be unfortunately complementing each other.

1693
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:46,320
Sometimes the T...

1694
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:51,320
Sometimes the Reflins get really lucky and complement each other.

1695
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,320
And then other times it's really hard.

1696
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:01,320
He's very got...

1697
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:02,320
Very fast.

1698
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,320
I did a whole 500...

1699
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:06,320
300?

1700
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:08,320
700?

1701
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:09,320
Oh, that's right, I'm just that good.

1702
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:10,320
Oh, back off, back off.

1703
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:11,320
Easy.

1704
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:16,320
What is that Reflins going...

1705
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:17,320
Ahhhh!

1706
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:18,320
Four!

1707
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:20,320
Ahhhh!

1708
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,320
Oh, jeez.

1709
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:25,320
Is that you?

1710
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:26,320
It is you.

1711
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:28,320
All up in my ear.

1712
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:33,320
Last time it only got so far because of an exploit.

1713
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:34,320
Really?

1714
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,320
What is it?

1715
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:36,320
Let me do it right now.

1716
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:42,320
Reflink down, I repeat, Reflink down!

1717
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:45,320
It's not looking good, bruv.

1718
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:47,320
It's not looking good.

1719
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:49,320
Wait, did I leave my...

1720
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:50,320
Am I...

1721
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,320
Hold on, I can't open the map because there's an enemy.

1722
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,320
Oh, there they are, there's my soul.

1723
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:01,320
Magical Spiral can hit a bunch of times.

1724
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:03,320
Who's got Magical Spiral?

1725
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,320
Can I even do any magic?

1726
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:11,320
I think I'm like too weak to do like one bit of magic.

1727
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:12,320
I'm not even kidding.

1728
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:17,320
Yeah, like I literally cannot even hold weapons of magic.

1729
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:19,320
Go, Reflink, go!

1730
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:23,320
I'm sure this is a totally fair fight and you're not at all nerfed.

1731
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:27,320
Because of how the multiplayer works in this game.

1732
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:28,320
What's that?

1733
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,320
You're one shot and taking on this?

1734
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:35,320
Oh my god, I'm so bad at dodging.

1735
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:44,320
Excuse me.

1736
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,320
Oh, what is he doing?

1737
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:48,320
Oh, oh!

1738
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,320
Okay, I deserve that, I'm gonna be honest.

1739
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,320
I thought it was gonna be like one of them delayed attacks.

1740
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,320
I deserve that, sorry.

1741
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:57,320
Oh!

1742
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:59,320
Maybe not on the fire.

1743
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:04,320
Okay, we have Phase 2 unlocked.

1744
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:05,320
Ow!

1745
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:07,320
Bruh, I'm not gonna even survive.

1746
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:08,320
Ow!

1747
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:09,320
Wait, what?

1748
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:10,320
I can't get up!

1749
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,320
I couldn't get up!

1750
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:14,320
I got a stun lock!

1751
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,320
Maybe, I think I just lucked.

1752
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:26,320
I got a sticking stun lock there.

1753
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,320
I was getting wrecked and decked.

1754
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:31,320
Shaking my head, my head.

1755
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:33,320
Okay, let's try that again.

1756
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:36,320
You've had a shot, you've had a shot.

1757
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,320
You've not had a shot.

1758
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,320
When was that hit stop, man?

1759
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:44,320
You've not had a go.

1760
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:48,320
Tonsel Storm, a fucking ninja.

1761
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,320
Tonsel...

1762
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,320
Storm...

1763
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,320
Power!

1764
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:57,320
That means Ratt was too strong.

1765
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:59,320
Yeah, there's glitch.

1766
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,320
You guys better start abusing that glitch.

1767
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:03,320
Like, you abused it.

1768
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:09,320
Hydration check!

1769
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:15,320
He's...

1770
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:19,320
I was gonna do endurance until Mercy comes on.

1771
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,320
Oh, you're kneeling already?

1772
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,320
Are you kneeling like a good little piece of...

1773
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:25,320
Hold on.

1774
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:26,320
Eek!

1775
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:27,320
Oh, wait.

1776
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:28,320
Eek!

1777
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:29,320
Bunk!

1778
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:31,320
Oh, eek.

1779
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:33,320
Okay, and then two-hand it.

1780
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:36,320
And then I'm ready if you're ready!

1781
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:39,320
Nice and chill up in this game.

1782
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:41,320
I'm so sorry.

1783
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:44,320
I'm trying to make sure everyone who shows up gets a chance,

1784
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,320
and then I'll bring in reflins that I've been in before.

1785
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:48,320
Are you ready?

1786
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,320
The other one isn't ready.

1787
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:53,320
Is he away for a piss?

1788
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:55,320
Piss faster. Piss harder.

1789
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:59,320
Squeeze out your bladder.

1790
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,320
Or let me press.

1791
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:07,320
Let me press down on your prostate to make it come out faster.

1792
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:09,320
Fry that chicken.

1793
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:11,320
Until Mercy will be here at least Monday.

1794
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:12,320
Oh, is Mercy off?

1795
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:14,320
Okay, my bad.

1796
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:18,320
Just because I've woken up four hours before stream?

1797
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:19,320
God, you're pissing hard.

1798
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:20,320
God, damn.

1799
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,320
How much have you gotten the engine?

1800
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:37,320
What happened?

1801
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:40,320
How do I mo-

1802
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:42,320
No, not status.

1803
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:43,320
Gestures.

1804
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:44,320
Let's sit.

1805
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,320
Low rest.

1806
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:49,320
I'm gonna put my foot up your ass.

1807
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:51,320
I'm like, I'm floating next to you.

1808
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:57,320
No, no.

1809
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:59,320
Bladder for the prostate brain.

1810
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:04,320
No, I think that if your prostate is in trouble,

1811
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:08,320
your pee, your ability to pee is the first thing that goes a bit funny.

1812
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:10,320
Like, it doesn't come out properly.

1813
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:13,320
He's gonna rip starting a chainsaw.

1814
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:21,320
Still 30 plus before I can join?

1815
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:22,320
Oh, minutes?

1816
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:23,320
Oh, no, I'm streaming quite a bit.

1817
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:28,320
Mercy might not be streaming tonight since she is staying with a friend.

1818
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:32,320
Her friend is streaming for the time since they lost their pet colon on the score monitor.

1819
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:34,320
Aw, that's a shame.

1820
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,320
Thank you, Sashpower, for telling me.

1821
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:37,320
I didn't realize.

1822
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:38,320
Aw.

1823
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:40,320
That's not so nice.

1824
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:42,320
Mate, how did I do that mimic thing?

1825
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,320
I didn't pick up the mimic thing yet,

1826
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,320
because we've not even played the base game.

1827
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,320
We started, like, on a fresh account,

1828
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,320
and then you guys gave me everything to level up.

1829
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:53,320
I don't have that mimic thing.

1830
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:55,320
The best I can do is a mo-

1831
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,320
Oh, mother!

1832
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:59,320
Oh, Reefling, please!

1833
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:01,320
Reefling, please carry me!

1834
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:03,320
Please!

1835
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:04,320
I don't know.

1836
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:09,320
Please carry us!

1837
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:10,320
Come back!

1838
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:11,320
Come back!

1839
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:17,320
Unlarged prostate presses on the urine pipe making pain harder.

1840
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:19,320
Exactly, that's why you need to eat tomatoes.

1841
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:22,320
I've told you once, I've told you twice.

1842
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:24,320
Even ketchup counts.

1843
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:25,320
Yes, ketchup counts.

1844
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:27,320
I don't know why it does.

1845
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:28,320
It just does.

1846
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,320
What are you doing?

1847
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:33,320
How do you put your thing down in BAFK?

1848
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,320
Into a seamless co-op mod.

1849
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:42,320
I would play seamless co-op,

1850
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:45,320
but I thought it showed your IP or something like that,

1851
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:48,320
whereas playing it through the servers definitely helps.

1852
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,320
I'm sorry, I went to go eat.

1853
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:51,320
Can I kick you out?

1854
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:53,320
I don't really want to kick you out, but...

1855
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:55,320
Oh, I can kick you out.

1856
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:57,320
Sorry, right, itadakimasu.

1857
01:45:57,320 --> 01:45:58,320
Bye.

1858
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:01,320
I won't write down your name because that doesn't count.

1859
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:03,320
Itadakimasu.

1860
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:07,320
Eat the talking mod.

1861
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:08,320
Cheeto the man.

1862
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:09,320
I'm not a Jewin.

1863
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:12,320
Cheeto the man.

1864
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:14,320
There we go.

1865
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,320
Itadakimasu.

1866
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:21,320
You're making me hungry and it's not even 6am.

1867
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:25,320
There's literally need deliveries for another two hours.

1868
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:30,320
Although, I don't want McDonald's breakfast

1869
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,320
because it makes me sick.

1870
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:34,320
Well, McDonald's...

1871
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:36,320
McDonald's...

1872
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:37,320
I'm sorry.

1873
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:42,320
Did you know in French they say McDonald's is McDonald's?

1874
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:47,320
Are you ready?

1875
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:49,320
Are you ready to carry me through the dragon?

1876
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:53,320
I check my prostate regularly, mommy.

1877
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:56,320
It's good, good!

1878
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:58,320
As you should, Refling.

1879
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,320
As you should.

1880
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:02,320
I don't...

1881
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:04,320
I didn't even...

1882
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,320
I'm getting walloped.

1883
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:08,320
Okay.

1884
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:13,320
I'm helping, I'm helping.

1885
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:16,320
I'm getting them while it's distracted.

1886
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:20,320
He's distracted.

1887
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:23,320
I'm backing off, I'm backing off.

1888
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:27,320
Okay, he's burning, he's burning.

1889
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:32,320
Okay, let's get his tail.

1890
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:35,320
I'm actually doing damage this time.

1891
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:36,320
A Christmas miracle.

1892
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:38,320
I'm helping my team.

1893
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:41,320
Hitting the stump deals extra damage.

1894
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:44,320
That seems so mean.

1895
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:49,320
Hit the disabled dragon on his little disabled parts.

1896
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:51,320
Okay, jeez.

1897
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:53,320
Who coded that one?

1898
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:56,320
I'm stuck under him.

1899
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:57,320
Oh, you got a...

1900
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:59,320
I'm literally stuck at his bobby.

1901
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:01,320
I repeat, I'm stuck in his bobby.

1902
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:03,320
I'm stuck in his bobby.

1903
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:05,320
Oh, my God.

1904
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:08,320
Let me go.

1905
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:11,320
I'm stuck at his fucking winky.

1906
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:17,320
I'm growing stuck, growing stuck.

1907
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,320
Oh, my God.

1908
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:22,320
Oh, that makes sense why I was getting

1909
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:25,320
fricking runnily at that last round.

1910
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:30,320
That dragon, that was a bad dragon.

1911
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:36,320
Come on, come on.

1912
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:37,320
Go for his tail.

1913
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:38,320
Oh, yeah.

1914
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:40,320
400 damage, baby.

1915
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,320
That's what they call me.

1916
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,320
The old hack and slash.

1917
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:48,320
Oh, why are you targeting me?

1918
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:52,320
Oh, my God.

1919
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:59,320
Did I pick up my tear, my souls?

1920
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:00,320
Where are they?

1921
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:03,320
Or do I not have souls anymore?

1922
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:05,320
Did I not die here?

1923
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:06,320
Hold on.

1924
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:07,320
Excuse me, whilst you fight,

1925
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:09,320
I'm going to go look for my dead souls.

1926
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:10,320
Where are they?

1927
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:11,320
Are they not here?

1928
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:13,320
I must have died.

1929
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:15,320
Whoa, I don't know what's going on behind me.

1930
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:16,320
I'm just happy to be here.

1931
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,320
I'm just happy to be here, honestly.

1932
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:19,320
Thank you, folks, for having me.

1933
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:21,320
No, really, it's been a pleasure.

1934
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:23,320
Did I not die somewhere?

1935
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:25,320
I don't remember.

1936
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:28,320
Oh, one of my refunds have died, Monka.

1937
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:37,320
Helping a little bit.

1938
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:41,320
I'm helping a little bit.

1939
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:44,320
See, I'm helping.

1940
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:49,320
And being helped to some HP damage.

1941
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:55,320
Oh, jeez, Louise.

1942
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:58,320
Can Cheeto do it?

1943
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:01,320
Oh, he's getting burnt alive.

1944
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:03,320
Don't worry, I'll do some damage.

1945
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:05,320
Look at me go, look at me go.

1946
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:07,320
A whole 3,000.

1947
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:12,320
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

1948
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:14,320
It's done a lot.

1949
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:16,320
Where did he go?

1950
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,320
Oh, there he is.

1951
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:22,320
It appears.

1952
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:31,320
Okay, 400, 7,000, 1.4, 1.7.

1953
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:36,320
Hydration.

1954
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:41,320
Ooh, I got his tail.

1955
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:44,320
I'm actually not being useless this fight.

1956
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:46,320
Please don't die.

1957
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:48,320
Oh, please don't die.

1958
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:53,320
Okay, and then hydrate that.

1959
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:56,320
No, no.

1960
01:50:57,320 --> 01:50:59,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1961
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:02,320
Hold on, let me drink that.

1962
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:04,320
And then let me ult.

1963
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:06,320
Ow.

1964
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:09,320
God, I just, I can't even catch a break.

1965
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,320
Curse you, Bail.

1966
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:18,320
I actually still don't know what the lore of Bad Bail is.

1967
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:21,320
Like, is he a really, really big baddie?

1968
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:23,320
Or is he a wee baddie?

1969
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:27,320
400, ow.

1970
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:30,320
I keep getting killed by his fire.

1971
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:33,320
Okay, 400, take that.

1972
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:35,320
400, take that.

1973
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:37,320
Oh, shit.

1974
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:39,320
No, not again, Reefling.

1975
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:40,320
Not again.

1976
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,320
Reefling, no, he's 1 HP.

1977
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:45,320
And I'm 1 HP.

1978
01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:47,320
Hold on a hydrate.

1979
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:49,320
I don't have any heals.

1980
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:51,320
Not again, not again, not again.

1981
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:53,320
Please, swing, swing, swing.

1982
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:55,320
Oh, no.

1983
01:51:55,320 --> 01:51:57,320
Why?

1984
01:51:57,320 --> 01:51:59,320
Whoa.

1985
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:01,320
He's a pixel.

1986
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:04,320
And then a swing in his head's not even in front of me.

1987
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:06,320
How did I keep doing this?

1988
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:08,320
I'm fumbling.

1989
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:11,320
I'm fumbling.

1990
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:16,320
I don't know how to, how about, I did so much damage that time.

1991
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,320
Like, I actually damaged the enemy.

1992
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:20,320
You've had a, oh, no, don't sit down.

1993
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:24,320
Bruh, that's the second time already.

1994
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,320
Like, a slither.

1995
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:28,320
Bubble boy, you've not had a chance.

1996
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:31,320
Bubble boy.

1997
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:35,320
Here's not.

1998
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:36,320
You've had a chance.

1999
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:38,320
You had a chance.

2000
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:40,320
Dizzy, you're new.

2001
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:45,320
I can't believe I've done that twice now.

2002
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:48,320
You could probably put a compilation every time, like,

2003
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:53,320
it's 1 HP and I'm the last one standing and I completely bowls up.

2004
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:55,320
I'm gonna kick its arse.

2005
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:56,320
Can I say that?

2006
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,320
Yes, you most certainly can.

2007
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:00,320
Third time's the charm.

2008
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:02,320
Literally, surely I will clutch up.

2009
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:05,320
I was doing so well, like, actually doing like a wee bit of damage

2010
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:07,320
and then backing off and going in and backing off and going in

2011
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:09,320
and backing off and going in and backing off and going in

2012
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:11,320
and backing off and going in.

2013
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:14,320
I did like a whole 5,000 damage

2014
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:17,320
against the 1,500 HP bots.

2015
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:20,320
I actually don't know how big, are you ready?

2016
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,320
Muah, muah, let's go.

2017
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:24,320
Fuck em up.

2018
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:27,320
And by, by let's fuck em up, I mean you fuck em up.

2019
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:29,320
Okay, let me run a little to the left.

2020
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:33,320
Oh, he didn't aggro to me.

2021
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:35,320
He instantly went for a refund.

2022
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,320
Curious.

2023
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:41,320
That's right, take this.

2024
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:43,320
There we go, 300 damage.

2025
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:44,320
Take that.

2026
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:45,320
Oh, I missed.

2027
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:46,320
Take that.

2028
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:48,320
300, 600.

2029
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:50,320
Oh, don't go for me though.

2030
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:53,320
Oh, he got that scarlet.

2031
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:59,320
He got that scarlet brought to his doorstep.

2032
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:00,320
Oh, yeah.

2033
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,320
Take it, take his wee hand.

2034
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:03,320
Oh, his hand, his hand.

2035
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:05,320
All right, well, that was close enough.

2036
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:08,320
Right, I'm getting absolutely decimated this time around.

2037
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:10,320
I don't know what's going on.

2038
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:13,320
It's almost like there's a common denominator.

2039
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:14,320
That's the problem.

2040
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:17,320
And the problem is me, let's be honest.

2041
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:19,320
Okay, I'm helping.

2042
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:21,320
There, I hit this tail, I'm helping.

2043
01:54:23,320 --> 01:54:24,320
Oh, come on.

2044
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:28,320
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on.

2045
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:31,320
Okay, and then aggro swap.

2046
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:33,320
No, no, no aggro swap.

2047
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:34,320
Okay.

2048
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:36,320
I'll take it.

2049
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:37,320
I've got it from here.

2050
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:41,320
1,000, 1.4, 2.6 or something.

2051
01:54:41,320 --> 01:54:42,320
I don't know.

2052
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:43,320
I'm going for the tail.

2053
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:45,320
I'm kind of helping.

2054
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:46,320
It's like a group effort.

2055
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:48,320
It's like a group project, you know?

2056
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:50,320
I'm going to take my wondrous physique,

2057
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:51,320
because I have no idea what to put on it.

2058
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:54,320
It was like heels I put on it, purely and nothing else.

2059
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,320
Oh, I found my souls.

2060
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:58,320
But those will be my dead, dead souls.

2061
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:03,320
Oh, easy.

2062
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:08,320
I don't need to get too scandalous.

2063
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:11,320
How does this always hit me?

2064
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:13,320
Right, fuck it.

2065
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:16,320
I'm doing that from away.

2066
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:20,320
I'm helping, I'm helping.

2067
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:21,320
400.

2068
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:25,320
Oh, we've got a critical.

2069
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:26,320
We've got a critical.

2070
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:29,320
Got a wee cheeky critical hit.

2071
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:30,320
Oh, I'm off.

2072
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:32,320
I'm away.

2073
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:33,320
He's away doing something.

2074
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:35,320
Oh, phase two already?

2075
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:39,320
Isn't that a bit early?

2076
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:41,320
That's not 50% of his HP.

2077
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:47,320
That's not 50% of his HP.

2078
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:52,320
I feel like that's cheeky, little one.

2079
01:55:53,320 --> 01:55:55,320
He thinks he's powerful.

2080
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:57,320
I miss.

2081
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:03,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2082
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:04,320
Am I going to go?

2083
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:05,320
No.

2084
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:06,320
I can go in.

2085
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:11,320
No.

2086
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:14,320
I need like fire resistance on or something.

2087
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:15,320
Hold on a minute.

2088
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:16,320
You guys keep the good fight.

2089
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:18,320
I'm sure I have a fire resistance.

2090
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:19,320
Yeah, you guys keep going.

2091
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:20,320
No, you're doing great.

2092
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:21,320
Yep, keep it up.

2093
01:56:21,320 --> 01:56:22,320
Fire.

2094
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:28,320
No, you're doing great, sweetie.

2095
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:29,320
Keep it up.

2096
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:32,320
No, one refund stone.

2097
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:36,320
Oh, this is too much HP for a meter.

2098
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:40,320
Be able to...

2099
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:43,320
Oh, I'm not even...

2100
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:45,320
See, this is why I don't like the auto lock

2101
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:47,320
when it's constantly the face and nothing else.

2102
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:54,320
I'm trying to get as we nub...

2103
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:57,320
Oh, I miss.

2104
01:56:57,320 --> 01:56:58,320
I think.

2105
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:01,320
I'm a stamina.

2106
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:03,320
I'm staminaing away.

2107
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:04,320
I'm running away.

2108
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:08,320
Right, give me your wee leg.

2109
01:57:09,320 --> 01:57:11,320
I've noticed this tail actually covers this wee leg,

2110
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:14,320
but that's a good detail in the design

2111
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:19,320
that his tail, like, covers it.

2112
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:22,320
And maybe he uses his tail for a balance as well,

2113
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:24,320
because he's not got it.

2114
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:27,320
No, don't leave me a defeat.

2115
01:57:27,320 --> 01:57:30,320
He's not even half HP, is Ogre.

2116
01:57:31,320 --> 01:57:32,320
See that?

2117
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:33,320
That's what I can't be arse with.

2118
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:34,320
No, I'm going for it.

2119
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:37,320
I'm going for it.

2120
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:40,320
Right, no.

2121
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:42,320
I'm calling in for reinforcements.

2122
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:44,320
Okay, I didn't do not do enough damage

2123
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,320
to deal with any of this.

2124
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:48,320
Not me perfectly avoid...

2125
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:49,320
Yeah, just kill me.

2126
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:51,320
Balls in your core.

2127
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:53,320
Yeah, the ball's out my core.

2128
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:54,320
I'm kicking it.

2129
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:55,320
I'm calling for backup.

2130
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:05,320
The low HP transition,

2131
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:06,320
because he was stuck in an animation

2132
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:08,320
while refling said a lot of damage.

2133
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:09,320
Uh-huh.

2134
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:12,320
You can...

2135
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:14,320
If you need a fire resistant talisman,

2136
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:15,320
I'm pretty sure that's what I put on.

2137
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:16,320
I can't...

2138
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,320
What do these do?

2139
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:18,320
Why do they not...

2140
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:19,320
Why does it not say what it does?

2141
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:21,320
Details, not the wrong one.

2142
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:24,320
Boost fire negation, yeah.

2143
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:25,320
And then what about that one?

2144
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:27,320
Greatly raises stamina.

2145
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:30,320
Enhances jump attack, I do like jumping.

2146
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:35,320
Raises maximum HP stamina and equipment, yeah.

2147
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:37,320
These ones were good for me.

2148
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:41,320
Was there anyone who's not had a chance yet?

2149
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:42,320
Hermione?

2150
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:48,320
Fucking clean Harry Potter over here.

2151
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:55,320
Elvarith, you came in earlier.

2152
01:58:58,320 --> 01:58:59,320
Oh, I guess we're back to the start.

2153
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:00,320
Right, okay.

2154
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:02,320
Who was first?

2155
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:04,320
Takum, you're first.

2156
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:17,860
I think packs are wallet both fire and lightning oh

2157
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:26,220
ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

2158
01:59:26,220 --> 01:59:33,400
and lightning I even have anything for lightning it's under button lighting very very very

2159
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:35,400
Galileo

2160
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:40,320
Okay, uh, what are you ready to fuck them up?

2161
01:59:41,740 --> 01:59:43,740
Have is one glowing and one not

2162
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:46,620
I'm not sure how we done that

2163
01:59:48,740 --> 01:59:50,740
Check if you have livers

2164
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:55,100
But that would imply I'm the one needing to do the damage

2165
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:57,780
Oh

2166
01:59:59,300 --> 02:00:02,620
Hold on how is they paying attention? No

2167
02:00:04,140 --> 02:00:08,200
Please don't die as soon as we enter the arena. That would be rather embarrassing

2168
02:00:09,580 --> 02:00:11,580
Please don't do that

2169
02:00:11,700 --> 02:00:13,700
livers or defense

2170
02:00:15,620 --> 02:00:17,620
Are they a resource?

2171
02:00:22,100 --> 02:00:24,220
Actually gonna have to change to magic spec

2172
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:29,140
So I can do something for my team

2173
02:00:33,020 --> 02:00:43,900
Okay, so that fire blast isn't as big as I once anticipated. Oh my gosh, I missed I did 300 damage though

2174
02:00:46,620 --> 02:00:48,220
I

2175
02:00:48,220 --> 02:00:51,020
Can't believe it. I can't get away from the healer

2176
02:00:51,900 --> 02:00:54,820
The gender rules these gender rules have hands

2177
02:00:56,940 --> 02:00:58,940
I'm order some

2178
02:00:59,620 --> 02:01:01,620
Okay, there we go. Oh

2179
02:01:04,020 --> 02:01:06,020
I miss oh

2180
02:01:07,180 --> 02:01:12,580
We're doing good. Oh, I like that attack was at the Sun. Oh

2181
02:01:14,140 --> 02:01:16,820
We're going all to a critical hit on them

2182
02:01:17,420 --> 02:01:21,420
300 600

2183
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:26,380
I'm just out of range and no more

2184
02:01:27,620 --> 02:01:30,580
Okay phase two we can do it

2185
02:01:31,620 --> 02:01:34,060
I'm not being attacked by those bolts either

2186
02:01:34,940 --> 02:01:36,940
Where is it?

2187
02:01:37,700 --> 02:01:39,700
The mages doing damage. Oh

2188
02:01:40,180 --> 02:01:41,700
No

2189
02:01:41,700 --> 02:01:43,700
Reflings down

2190
02:01:44,700 --> 02:01:46,700
No pressure

2191
02:01:48,380 --> 02:01:50,380
No pressure

2192
02:01:54,700 --> 02:01:56,700
Instantly misses well

2193
02:01:58,300 --> 02:02:00,300
Okay, let's go for his buck. Oh

2194
02:02:01,660 --> 02:02:03,660
Yeah, oh

2195
02:02:03,740 --> 02:02:07,560
That's some say this fire goes like all the way up his backside and I'm like bro

2196
02:02:08,620 --> 02:02:11,820
I'm just trying to you know do my thing. Oh

2197
02:02:12,540 --> 02:02:15,780
My god, I hate when they hold it cuz I can never predict bro

2198
02:02:16,980 --> 02:02:19,700
Did I dodge that? I don't know how I was just spamming

2199
02:02:21,980 --> 02:02:23,980
400 oh, yeah

2200
02:02:23,980 --> 02:02:29,660
That's right. I bet you feel intimidated knowing that I'm in the battlefield. Oh come on. Oh

2201
02:02:31,340 --> 02:02:33,500
Yeah, I'm so intimidating take this

2202
02:02:42,060 --> 02:02:44,060
He's mortified

2203
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:49,300
He goes on all big strong he's in the battle with me

2204
02:02:50,340 --> 02:02:55,100
Please there's something to help my poor replay. Okay at thousand. I'll take it

2205
02:02:55,980 --> 02:03:01,380
Okay, that was good. That was good. I'm gonna get to yank aggro for a second. I'm helping and help

2206
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:04,660
Let's just run. Let's just run. I'm off

2207
02:03:06,540 --> 02:03:08,540
Okay, I don't know how it

2208
02:03:09,180 --> 02:03:11,180
Was wise enough to dodge that

2209
02:03:12,220 --> 02:03:17,020
Oh my god, I just realized when you guys connect to me you have to deal with the ping problem as well

2210
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:23,980
You can't even dodge effectively because when you dodge that the enemy's already done is attack. Oh, hold on. Let me hide you

2211
02:03:26,580 --> 02:03:30,300
Oh, okay, if I just stay alive

2212
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:35,940
Let's grab that

2213
02:03:36,380 --> 02:03:38,380
I

2214
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:42,380
I'm coming

2215
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:45,780
400 that's right. Mm-hmm a whole

2216
02:03:46,700 --> 02:03:48,700
700 damage. I'm

2217
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:51,380
unstoppable

2218
02:03:51,580 --> 02:03:58,780
What is this one? Oh, I thought it was the lightning one that chases me. Am I dead? No, there's a chance

2219
02:03:58,780 --> 02:04:00,780
Oh

2220
02:04:04,940 --> 02:04:06,940
Miss

2221
02:04:09,780 --> 02:04:13,820
I missed again, okay, 500 1000

2222
02:04:14,900 --> 02:04:19,140
Okay, that probably wasn't worth it and all on a stick

2223
02:04:22,460 --> 02:04:24,460
Oh

2224
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:26,460
Oh

2225
02:04:26,540 --> 02:04:29,820
Right hydrate, okay, I'm gonna heal so

2226
02:04:31,020 --> 02:04:37,380
I'm gonna just cheer from the side lane go refling. Oh go refling. Go

2227
02:04:40,340 --> 02:04:42,340

2245
02:05:56,860 --> 02:05:59,580
I don't really see how else I'm supposed to avoid it

2246
02:06:05,060 --> 02:06:07,740
Stony and not getting a hit when everyone else dies

2247
02:06:08,900 --> 02:06:10,900

2248
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:13,820

Elden ring player that

2267
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:39,400
That we don't know of it. Are you hating your true identity?

2268
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:44,360
Their head is the weak point, but it's where their attacks come from

2269
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:48,040
Mmm, okay, I'm gonna help by doing this

2270

2274
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:10,600
Oh

2275
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:14,200

Okay, hold on

2277
02:08:20,240 --> 02:08:28,040
Maybe the crossbow would help with this because he's so tall. I think I'm stuck on his groin again. No, okay, I'm fine

2278
02:08:39,200 --> 02:08:41,200

02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:02,520
No, just go a little harder

2282
02:09:09,160 --> 02:09:15,320
You go for a little numb he's gonna be mad at you. Why does this don't go further?

2283
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:20,760
Okay, let me hydrate

02:09:24,920 --> 02:09:26,920

2286
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:41,160
Oh

2287
02:09:51,240 --> 02:09:54,040
Come I was right on the outskirts

2288
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:00,200
Literally right on the outskirts

2289
02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:02,680
I

2290
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:10,760
I'm working on I'm working on it's a team effort

2291
02:10:12,120 --> 02:10:14,120
It's a team effort

2292
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:16,200
I did a bit. I actually did a decent

2293
02:10:17,640 --> 02:10:23,080
Not to berag or anything, but that was all me if we get to phase two that was all me

2294
02:10:23,880 --> 02:10:28,200
It wasn't because that reflin knocked him down and just decimated him

2295
02:10:30,360 --> 02:10:32,360
Okay, there

2296
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:36,920
Phase two no still phase one

2297
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:40,520
He's being very respectful

2298
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:44,040
Very very respectful

2299
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:56,440
Uh-huh

2300
02:10:57,240 --> 02:10:59,240

2301
02:10:59,640 --> 02:11:01,640

02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:07,080
Cheeky 800. Uh-huh. I wish I could summon you's inside the battleground

2306
02:11:30,120 --> 02:11:32,120
Sure, let's drink my magic

2307

I'm sure about to do real good damage

2308
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:39,160
I can't even get closer to him

2309
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:43,560
How are you supposed to get closer without losing your stamina? Honestly

2310
02:11:45,240 --> 02:11:50,280
I think as soon as you get in the fight the the key goes away again. He's like I'm having a

02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:53,480

I

2313
02:12:03,400 --> 02:12:08,760
Just wish it wouldn't lock onto his head. I wish it would pick his leg or something. Um, and he goes away

2314
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:19,560
I'm gonna go get a muffin after this fight. I need some food in my tummy

Take that

2392
02:19:00,680 --> 02:19:02,680
Take that

2393
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:04,920
All that damage. Oh me baby

2394
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:10,200
There we go, there we go

2395
02:19:10,760 --> 02:19:12,760
Not me. Not me. Not me

2396
02:19:12,840 --> 02:19:15,160
I'm a good. I am a good

2397
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:21,240
Elden lord, even though I'm not Elden lord because I've not done the base game for this account

2398
02:19:23,240 --> 02:19:25,240
Oh hydration

2399
02:19:26,040 --> 02:19:28,040
Hydration hydration hydration

2400
02:19:28,200 --> 02:19:31,800
Okay, let's get close. No, let's back off. Let's back off

2401
02:19:32,040 --> 02:19:34,760
I think backing off would be the wise thing to do. I don't know about you

2402
02:19:36,120 --> 02:19:40,120
Oh, and we're phase two we're phase two phase two phase two

2403
02:19:41,560 --> 02:19:43,560
Okay

2404
02:19:47,080 --> 02:19:50,120
Okay, I mean I can still spray from here

2405
02:19:56,600 --> 02:19:58,600
We're gonna need you at calm down

2406
02:19:59,560 --> 02:20:02,280
This is insane

2407
02:20:09,560 --> 02:20:12,680
Take that maybe arsehole honestly, where is he?

2408
02:20:15,560 --> 02:20:21,000
Little strongy, maybe if you all locked on to him, you'd know. Okay, right and your point

2409
02:20:22,120 --> 02:20:24,120
Right, let me read

2410
02:20:24,280 --> 02:20:26,280
I might just put on any old ball

2411
02:20:27,240 --> 02:20:29,800
I know they're fighting in the background. They're trying their best

2412
02:20:32,040 --> 02:20:35,800
Let's get a bit closer. I still have two healing so it's following me

2413
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:43,160
Okay, okay, let's get nice and close

2414
02:20:45,480 --> 02:20:50,200
Okay, let's reload. Okay, I got 200 for that. Whoa

2415
02:20:52,360 --> 02:20:54,360
Now don't be looking at me

2416
02:20:56,520 --> 02:20:58,520
I'm going I'm going I'm going

2417
02:21:00,120 --> 02:21:03,560
Where I'm running to no one's no one can I do it from here?

2418
02:21:06,200 --> 02:21:08,200
Yeah, it looks like it

2419
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:14,520
What's that one?

2420
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:16,920
300s. Okay, I'll take it

2421
02:21:20,360 --> 02:21:22,520
I'll take it

2422
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:29,080
Okay, I'm doing way more of these fights though with this. Okay. I'm sticking to this. I'm doing like way more. No rifling stun

2423
02:21:33,320 --> 02:21:35,320
I don't know what to look at

2424
02:21:36,920 --> 02:21:38,920
No

2425
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:40,920
I'm a stamina

2426
02:21:40,920 --> 02:21:42,920
Ow, I'm a stamina

2427
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:48,040
I'm I wonder why I'm out of stamina also me who just spam spam spam

2428
02:21:48,760 --> 02:21:50,200
hydration

2429
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:52,200
Good

2430
02:21:52,280 --> 02:21:54,280
Look at the enemy

2431
02:21:55,080 --> 02:22:00,520
Great. No, we don't no, we don't no, we don't we're gonna swap to our sword in a second. That's what we're gonna do

2432
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:11,000
That's okay. That's okay. I needed my sword. Okay. I needed my sword. It's not a big deal. I still have a healing flask

2433
02:22:13,640 --> 02:22:17,480
I can swing my sword sword you cannot afford

2434
02:22:18,440 --> 02:22:22,440
Right and press y press right bumper and then boom two handed just like that

2435
02:22:24,360 --> 02:22:26,360
Whoa

2436
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:31,560
500 cheeky stop aiming for the head

2437
02:22:35,080 --> 02:22:37,400
So-called CBT experts

2438
02:22:38,440 --> 02:22:40,840
Stopping for the head. Whoa

2439
02:22:41,720 --> 02:22:47,720
I'm out of heels. I'm out of heels and I'm getting annihilated

2440
02:22:48,760 --> 02:22:51,960
Can I get a hit before I go down? Nope

2441
02:22:53,480 --> 02:23:00,840
I hate this like every time right? I'm eating my muffin. This this is the muffin gang team. It seems called muffin gang

2442
02:23:01,240 --> 02:23:03,240
I

2443
02:23:07,720 --> 02:23:13,640
Know we can do this. I'm sorry. I refuse to walk away from this boss. I know we can do it

2444
02:23:15,640 --> 02:23:18,920
Don't you guys are getting so close stance breaker

2445
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:22,200
I like I'm sure we can do it

2446
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:24,760
You guys like believe me too, right?

2447
02:23:25,080 --> 02:23:33,640
It's getting late rest well sleep well. Sorry. I sleep at sleep stream at such a rubbish time over zero. You've not had a chance

2448
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,800
I love muffin. Wait, are you trying to give me something?

2449
02:23:55,560 --> 02:24:01,820
Okay, I'm eating my them. No, no, no, no, okay hydration. I need hydrated

2450
02:24:01,820 --> 02:24:24,520
Is that what you come in to do?

2451
02:24:24,520 --> 02:24:28,940
Are you giving me something to try and help me win?

2452
02:24:29,940 --> 02:24:32,940
Okay, I've hydrated.

2453
02:24:32,940 --> 02:24:34,940
Oh, no, you are giving me something.

2454
02:24:34,940 --> 02:24:35,940
What are you giving me?

2455
02:24:35,940 --> 02:24:38,940
Oh, how did you get better talisman than me?

2456
02:24:38,940 --> 02:24:39,940
That's cheating.

2457
02:24:39,940 --> 02:24:41,940
What?

2458
02:24:41,940 --> 02:24:44,940
A golden breed?

2459
02:24:44,940 --> 02:24:46,940
Hmm.

2460
02:24:46,940 --> 02:24:48,940
Who's holy damage?

2461
02:24:48,940 --> 02:24:51,940
Is a dragon holy damage?

2462
02:24:51,940 --> 02:24:53,940
Mole, mole.

2463
02:24:53,940 --> 02:24:56,940
That's definitely better than what I freaking got.

2464
02:24:56,940 --> 02:24:57,940
Thank you.

2465
02:24:57,940 --> 02:24:59,940
I assume you can't have that, right?

2466
02:24:59,940 --> 02:25:01,940
Forget the jump attacks for now, okay?

2467
02:25:01,940 --> 02:25:03,940
Let's defend.

2468
02:25:06,940 --> 02:25:11,940
So should I just take this spray and pre-out?

2469
02:25:11,940 --> 02:25:15,940
I'll take the spray and pre-out and then I'll just...

2470
02:25:15,940 --> 02:25:18,940
Because you guys gave me like tons of freaking bolts.

2471
02:25:18,940 --> 02:25:20,940
Like tons of them.

2472
02:25:20,940 --> 02:25:22,940
So I'm gonna just pop them on.

2473
02:25:22,940 --> 02:25:24,940
Oh, there's more?

2474
02:25:24,940 --> 02:25:26,940
A spell drake.

2475
02:25:26,940 --> 02:25:28,940
Dragon...

2476
02:25:28,940 --> 02:25:30,940
These are big though.

2477
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:32,940
These are like...

2478
02:25:32,940 --> 02:25:34,940
Enormously boost physical...

2479
02:25:34,940 --> 02:25:37,940
So I could just go full defense on all of these?

2480
02:25:37,940 --> 02:25:39,940
Fuck it.

2481
02:25:39,940 --> 02:25:41,940
Oh!

2482
02:25:43,940 --> 02:25:45,940
Thank you for your sacrifice.

2483
02:25:45,940 --> 02:25:48,940
I mean, you can just like, furl out if you want.

2484
02:25:49,940 --> 02:25:51,940
Um...

2485
02:25:52,940 --> 02:25:54,940
The azure red sign down?

2486
02:25:55,940 --> 02:25:57,940
I don't see it.

2487
02:25:58,940 --> 02:26:01,940
I don't see any other invading.

2488
02:26:05,940 --> 02:26:08,940
I will see a red sign!

2489
02:26:11,940 --> 02:26:13,940
The magic one does nothing for this boss?

2490
02:26:13,940 --> 02:26:15,940
Oh, I might see you. There you go.

2491
02:26:15,940 --> 02:26:17,940
I might...

2492
02:26:17,940 --> 02:26:19,940
Okay, the magic one does nothing.

2493
02:26:19,940 --> 02:26:22,940
So we'll put on...

2494
02:26:22,940 --> 02:26:24,940
A bow range.

2495
02:26:25,940 --> 02:26:27,940
Maybe.

2496
02:26:27,940 --> 02:26:29,940
Maybe, maybe.

2497
02:26:29,940 --> 02:26:31,940
Great leap is HP.

2498
02:26:32,940 --> 02:26:34,940
What are you then?

2499
02:26:34,940 --> 02:26:36,940
Shortens casting speed of sorcery.

2500
02:26:36,940 --> 02:26:39,940
But increases damage taken.

2501
02:26:39,940 --> 02:26:41,940
I don't want to just jump attack.

2502
02:26:41,940 --> 02:26:43,940
Maybe like...

2503
02:26:43,940 --> 02:26:46,940
Raises attack power after critical hit.

2504
02:26:46,940 --> 02:26:48,940
These are so specific.

2505
02:26:48,940 --> 02:26:51,940
I'm like bruh, I'm never gonna use this stuff.

2506
02:26:52,940 --> 02:26:54,940
Let's do that one.

2507
02:26:54,940 --> 02:26:56,940
What do you got?

2508
02:26:56,940 --> 02:26:58,940
A bow!

2509
02:26:58,940 --> 02:27:00,940
I don't think I've used the bow.

2510
02:27:00,940 --> 02:27:02,940
Is the bow better than what I've got?

2511
02:27:04,940 --> 02:27:06,940
It costs magic.

2512
02:27:06,940 --> 02:27:08,940
Oh my god! This thing's massive!

2513
02:27:08,940 --> 02:27:11,940
This looks like something a monster hunter.

2514
02:27:12,940 --> 02:27:14,940
Oh my gosh!

2515
02:27:14,940 --> 02:27:16,940
This is a monster hunter bow!

2516
02:27:16,940 --> 02:27:18,940
What the fuck?

2517
02:27:18,940 --> 02:27:20,940
Oh wait, hold on.

2518
02:27:20,940 --> 02:27:22,940
Okay.

2519
02:27:22,940 --> 02:27:24,940
Uh-huh.

2520
02:27:24,940 --> 02:27:26,940
Wait, I don't have...

2521
02:27:26,940 --> 02:27:28,940
I do so have arrows.

2522
02:27:28,940 --> 02:27:30,940
Wait, what?

2523
02:27:30,940 --> 02:27:32,940
I have arrows, they're right there.

2524
02:27:34,940 --> 02:27:36,940
Are these the needs?

2525
02:27:36,940 --> 02:27:38,940
Oh, maybe because it's a big boy.

2526
02:27:40,940 --> 02:27:42,940
What the hell is this?

2527
02:27:44,940 --> 02:27:46,940
Oh, that's cool.

2528
02:27:46,940 --> 02:27:48,940
Oh no, don't drink that.

2529
02:27:48,940 --> 02:27:50,940
Oh no.

2530
02:27:50,940 --> 02:27:52,940
Alright, okay, I need big boy stuff.

2531
02:27:54,940 --> 02:27:56,940
Two-handed sword talisman?

2532
02:27:56,940 --> 02:27:58,940
Sorry, let me explore for just a second.

2533
02:28:00,940 --> 02:28:02,940
Enhance this attack with two-handed...

2534
02:28:02,940 --> 02:28:04,940
Oh, I need that bad boy, Jesus.

2535
02:28:04,940 --> 02:28:06,940
And then raises everything.

2536
02:28:06,940 --> 02:28:08,940
Okay, that one seems like a good one.

2537
02:28:08,940 --> 02:28:10,940
Are we ready? I have my big bow narrow.

2538
02:28:10,940 --> 02:28:12,940
Are you ready?

2539
02:28:12,940 --> 02:28:14,940
Thank you for my insane monster hunter thing.

2540
02:28:14,940 --> 02:28:16,940
It's so big.

2541
02:28:16,940 --> 02:28:18,940
Is this Johnny's birthday already?

2542
02:28:18,940 --> 02:28:20,940
Honestly, get treated in, like, news.

2543
02:28:22,940 --> 02:28:24,940
If we lose this, I'm munching on

2544
02:28:24,940 --> 02:28:26,940
Doritos, okay?

2545
02:28:26,940 --> 02:28:28,940
If we lose this.

2546
02:28:28,940 --> 02:28:30,940
Okay, let's see this...

2547
02:28:30,940 --> 02:28:32,940
Right, let me...

2548
02:28:32,940 --> 02:28:34,940
Let him do his wee attack, right?

2549
02:28:34,940 --> 02:28:36,940
And then...

2550
02:28:36,940 --> 02:28:38,940
No, aim for him.

2551
02:28:38,940 --> 02:28:40,940
500, that was it.

2552
02:28:40,940 --> 02:28:42,940
No, no, no, no, no, don't go for me!

2553
02:28:42,940 --> 02:28:44,940
I'm just the innocent little...

2554
02:28:44,940 --> 02:28:46,940
Just the innocent little...

2555
02:28:46,940 --> 02:28:48,940
Streamer.

2556
02:28:48,940 --> 02:28:50,940
No, what are you talking about?

2557
02:28:50,940 --> 02:28:52,940
Wait, hold on, let me hydrate.

2558
02:28:52,940 --> 02:28:54,940
Curse you, Bail.

2559
02:28:54,940 --> 02:28:56,940
Alright, aim.

2560
02:28:56,940 --> 02:28:58,940
Look at him.

2561
02:28:58,940 --> 02:29:00,940
No, not his head, like his body.

2562
02:29:00,940 --> 02:29:02,940
Dude, his body.

2563
02:29:02,940 --> 02:29:04,940
No!

2564
02:29:06,940 --> 02:29:08,940
Okay, I hit his tail with that.

2565
02:29:10,940 --> 02:29:12,940
Oh, that's why someone was screaming in my ear.

2566
02:29:14,940 --> 02:29:16,940
I kept going...

2567
02:29:20,940 --> 02:29:22,940
This is, like, really weird.

2568
02:29:22,940 --> 02:29:24,940
Hold on.

2569
02:29:26,940 --> 02:29:28,940
Okay.

2570
02:29:28,940 --> 02:29:30,940
I'm doing 300 ahead?

2571
02:29:32,940 --> 02:29:34,940
No, I can't be.

2572
02:29:34,940 --> 02:29:36,940
Why would you...

2573
02:29:36,940 --> 02:29:38,940
Why would you randomly swap to me? Don't be stinky.

2574
02:29:40,940 --> 02:29:42,940
Alright, hold on.

2575
02:29:44,940 --> 02:29:46,940
Okay.

2576
02:29:56,940 --> 02:29:58,940
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2577
02:29:58,940 --> 02:30:00,940
That is cheating!

2578
02:30:04,940 --> 02:30:06,940
Hold down left 2 before firing.

2579
02:30:10,940 --> 02:30:12,940
Hold down left 2 before firing.

2580
02:30:14,940 --> 02:30:16,940
Like this?

2581
02:30:24,940 --> 02:30:26,940
I'm helping, I'm helping!

2582
02:30:26,940 --> 02:30:28,940
From halfway across the battlefield.

2583
02:30:32,940 --> 02:30:34,940
Wait, where's...

2584
02:30:34,940 --> 02:30:36,940
Why is nothing coming out?

2585
02:30:36,940 --> 02:30:38,940
Did I get shy? No.

2586
02:30:38,940 --> 02:30:40,940
What?

2587
02:30:40,940 --> 02:30:42,940
That was strange.

2588
02:30:44,940 --> 02:30:46,940
Okay, there we go.

2589
02:30:46,940 --> 02:30:48,940
Did I need to come over a bit?

2590
02:30:48,940 --> 02:30:50,940
I feel like I'm so... Oh, I'm stamina!

2591
02:30:50,940 --> 02:30:52,940
It takes stamina to hold a ball!

2592
02:30:52,940 --> 02:30:54,940
I didn't...

2593
02:30:54,940 --> 02:30:56,940
I didn't know that.

2594
02:30:56,940 --> 02:30:58,940
I didn't know it took stamina to hold a ball.

2595
02:30:58,940 --> 02:31:00,940
Sorry.

2596
02:31:02,940 --> 02:31:04,940
Okay.

2597
02:31:04,940 --> 02:31:06,940
No?

2598
02:31:06,940 --> 02:31:08,940
Yeah! Oh, I did 100.

2599
02:31:10,940 --> 02:31:12,940
I'm better getting closer with my...

2600
02:31:12,940 --> 02:31:14,940
Oh, as if.

2601
02:31:16,940 --> 02:31:18,940
Okay, and then I need to restore my stamina.

2602
02:31:18,940 --> 02:31:20,940
I mean, at least I'm helping.

2603
02:31:20,940 --> 02:31:22,940
At least I'm helping.

2604
02:31:22,940 --> 02:31:24,940
Okay, now he's going to do this horrible attack.

2605
02:31:24,940 --> 02:31:26,940
Yeah, that attack is just...

2606
02:31:26,940 --> 02:31:28,940
Absolutely.

2607
02:31:28,940 --> 02:31:30,940
I just...

2608
02:31:30,940 --> 02:31:32,940
So, if you didn't know, since sister did

2609
02:31:32,940 --> 02:31:34,940
like all Elden Ring bosses level 1,

2610
02:31:34,940 --> 02:31:36,940
I'm like, why would you even

2611
02:31:36,940 --> 02:31:38,940
torture yourself with that?

2612
02:31:38,940 --> 02:31:40,940
Like seriously, I don't know why,

2613
02:31:40,940 --> 02:31:42,940
or how she even did it.

2614
02:31:42,940 --> 02:31:44,940
Did I even hit?

2615
02:31:46,940 --> 02:31:48,940
No, that hit.

2616
02:31:48,940 --> 02:31:50,940
I saw it.

2617
02:31:50,940 --> 02:31:52,940
No!

2618
02:31:52,940 --> 02:31:54,940
My reefling's down! Oh my god, take...

2619
02:31:54,940 --> 02:31:56,940
No, evasive maneuvers, evasive maneuvers!

2620
02:31:56,940 --> 02:31:58,940
Get the sword out!

2621
02:31:58,940 --> 02:32:00,940
As soon as it's over, get the sword out.

2622
02:32:00,940 --> 02:32:02,940
Get the sword out. No, hold the sword.

2623
02:32:02,940 --> 02:32:04,940
There you go.

2624
02:32:04,940 --> 02:32:06,940
Oh, no!

2625
02:32:06,940 --> 02:32:08,940
Right, who is it that was

2626
02:32:08,940 --> 02:32:10,940
abusing the bug? Get back in here.

2627
02:32:10,940 --> 02:32:12,940
Get back in here! I'm not...

2628
02:32:12,940 --> 02:32:14,940
I literally am not going offline until he's gone.

2629
02:32:14,940 --> 02:32:16,940
Like, sorry. I think we can do it!

2630
02:32:16,940 --> 02:32:18,940
I just suck. That's the problem.

2631
02:32:18,940 --> 02:32:20,940
I just suck.

2632
02:32:20,940 --> 02:32:22,940
Okay, I broke the curse of me never getting a hit

2633
02:32:22,940 --> 02:32:24,940
when I'm the last one left.

2634
02:32:24,940 --> 02:32:26,940
Okay, oh no, I died. Oh no, that's so terrible.

2635
02:32:26,940 --> 02:32:28,940
Okay, more reefling!

2636
02:32:28,940 --> 02:32:30,940
More cannon fodder!

2637
02:32:32,940 --> 02:32:34,940
As soon as an MLG... Bruh.

2638
02:32:34,940 --> 02:32:36,940
We were going to do seamless co-op

2639
02:32:36,940 --> 02:32:38,940
in Ring collab at some point.

2640
02:32:38,940 --> 02:32:40,940
It would just be her

2641
02:32:40,940 --> 02:32:42,940
and me cheering from the sideline.

2642
02:32:42,940 --> 02:32:44,940
Although, I think I would probably do a magic run with her

2643
02:32:44,940 --> 02:32:46,940
because I've never done magic before.

2644
02:32:46,940 --> 02:32:48,940
Ellen...

2645
02:32:48,940 --> 02:32:50,940
Oh, I don't like who's been in.

2646
02:32:52,940 --> 02:32:54,940
I just said that chair in the room though.

2647
02:32:54,940 --> 02:32:56,940
No.

2648
02:32:56,940 --> 02:32:58,940
Uh, grass you have been in.

2649
02:32:58,940 --> 02:33:00,940
Is there anyone here?

2650
02:33:00,940 --> 02:33:02,940
Exploit only?

2651
02:33:02,940 --> 02:33:04,940
I mean...

2652
02:33:04,940 --> 02:33:06,940
I'll check if no one else has had a shot.

2653
02:33:06,940 --> 02:33:08,940
But...

2654
02:33:08,940 --> 02:33:10,940
If we're doing exploit...

2655
02:33:10,940 --> 02:33:12,940
Oh, Rhea, you've not had a shot?

2656
02:33:12,940 --> 02:33:14,940
Rhea here?

2657
02:33:14,940 --> 02:33:16,940
No, you've not. Right, we'll do an exploit only next time.

2658
02:33:16,940 --> 02:33:18,940
I kid you, I'm like, bruh,

2659
02:33:18,940 --> 02:33:20,940
we are so close to doing it.

2660
02:33:20,940 --> 02:33:22,940
Okay, your punishment

2661
02:33:22,940 --> 02:33:24,940
is that I have to eat some Doritos.

2662
02:33:24,940 --> 02:33:26,940
Oh, what punishment?

2663
02:33:26,940 --> 02:33:28,940
Exploit only looks promising,

2664
02:33:28,940 --> 02:33:30,940
honestly.

2665
02:33:30,940 --> 02:33:32,940
Alright, I'm going to mute for a second

2666
02:33:32,940 --> 02:33:34,940
while I munch my Krispies one sec.

2667
02:34:02,940 --> 02:34:04,940
Hmm...

2668
02:34:04,940 --> 02:34:06,940
Hmm...

2669
02:34:06,940 --> 02:34:08,940
Hmm...

2670
02:34:08,940 --> 02:34:10,940
Hmm...

2671
02:34:10,940 --> 02:34:12,940
Hmm...

2672
02:34:12,940 --> 02:34:14,940
Hmm...

2673
02:34:14,940 --> 02:34:16,940
I can't get him?

2674
02:34:16,940 --> 02:34:18,940
What?

2675
02:34:18,940 --> 02:34:20,940
No, I can't get him, sorry.

2676
02:34:20,940 --> 02:34:22,940
Hmm...

2677
02:34:22,940 --> 02:34:24,940
Hmm...

2678
02:34:24,940 --> 02:34:26,940
Hmm...

2679
02:34:26,940 --> 02:34:28,940
I only just got here.

2680
02:34:28,940 --> 02:34:30,940
I can definitely take more of a hammering

2681
02:34:30,940 --> 02:34:32,940
from his attack, so...

2682
02:34:32,940 --> 02:34:34,940
Let's get this party started!

2683
02:34:42,940 --> 02:34:44,940
Sorry, I'm mute because I got Marshmallow.

2684
02:34:44,940 --> 02:34:46,940
That was like, please don't eat in the make,

2685
02:34:46,940 --> 02:34:48,940
it really upsets me.

2686
02:34:48,940 --> 02:34:50,940
And I'm like, I don't purposely

2687
02:34:50,940 --> 02:34:52,940
try and eat in the make, I'm just eating!

2688
02:34:52,940 --> 02:34:54,940
I just don't want to upset anyone.

2689
02:34:56,940 --> 02:34:58,940
And I'm going to be honest,

2690
02:34:58,940 --> 02:35:05,140
I was inhaling those crisps uh oh my god wait oh my god 2,000 souls I have so many souls

2691
02:35:10,140 --> 02:35:12,140
Of course you burn

2692
02:35:14,380 --> 02:35:19,480
Not nice. Oh, I just rolled right into that fire

2693
02:35:22,780 --> 02:35:24,780
Hmm

2694
02:35:24,780 --> 02:35:26,780
Yeah

2695
02:35:28,260 --> 02:35:30,260
Should I get the Pew Pew Pew it

2696
02:35:31,540 --> 02:35:33,700
My god, he's gonna ham on that reef one

2697
02:35:34,940 --> 02:35:36,940
He's had enough of you

2698
02:35:37,540 --> 02:35:39,540
Ironically

2699
02:35:42,700 --> 02:35:44,700
Almost stamina

2700
02:35:49,020 --> 02:35:52,540
Okay, we all got a few good hits and a few good hits and let's not get greedy

2701
02:35:53,260 --> 02:36:00,980
Let's not get greedy and when you're feeling a bit hungry a bit peckish, but let's not get hashtag greedy, okay

2702
02:36:01,780 --> 02:36:03,780
Let's go for this me nub

2703
02:36:04,100 --> 02:36:06,100
We just need to focus on the nub that's all

2704
02:36:07,860 --> 02:36:12,060
Okay, well close enough. I'll take it a bearer than nothing. Oh

2705
02:36:13,220 --> 02:36:19,620
Reflins down already. Oh, we're not even face to I don't know. I don't know

2706
02:36:22,780 --> 02:36:28,500
I don't know if I should put the talisman on for aggro honestly and just run around in circles

2707
02:36:38,220 --> 02:36:40,220
Oh

2708
02:36:41,820 --> 02:36:46,300
No pressure to the other reflin, but I think it's on you

2709
02:36:47,300 --> 02:36:54,820
You don't forget I get a cheeky whacking. Okay there a thousand I did a thousand damage. I did what I had to do here

2710
02:37:02,180 --> 02:37:06,580
If I send you a martial scene, please don't eat in the makeup say what do you do? You can't please everyone

2711
02:37:06,580 --> 02:37:08,580
Hmm. I

2712
02:37:08,580 --> 02:37:12,940
Was inhaling them and it's really low like I don't mean to eat in the muffin. That's not very low

2713
02:37:16,900 --> 02:37:22,300
I'm am I doing anything? Oh clearly not. Oh

2714
02:37:27,700 --> 02:37:28,980
Oh

2715
02:37:28,980 --> 02:37:35,300
The way it switches aggro. You're so cheeky. You're such a cheeky enemy. You are you're naughty boy

2716
02:37:36,100 --> 02:37:38,860
Stop it. I need to hide right

2717
02:37:41,140 --> 02:37:45,060
He's so naughty take that to your little arm nub

2718
02:37:47,180 --> 02:37:49,180
I

2719
02:37:51,060 --> 02:37:55,460
Still break oh my god. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I

2720
02:37:56,860 --> 02:37:59,820
Mean we made it to phase two. I'll take that as a victory

2721
02:38:05,180 --> 02:38:05,900
I

2722
02:38:05,900 --> 02:38:11,100
Reflang a horrid I'm getting reflins to help me in game cuz I suck

2723
02:38:11,100 --> 02:38:13,100
I

2724
02:38:13,380 --> 02:38:14,740
Point blank

2725
02:38:14,740 --> 02:38:21,180
So we're doing this boss bail, but we can a hundred percent kill him because we got like close three times

2726
02:38:21,180 --> 02:38:25,100
I just need to stop messing up and actually help, but I'm not really helping much

2727
02:38:32,060 --> 02:38:36,140
And unfortunately the lag doesn't help and

2728
02:38:36,780 --> 02:38:44,580
And I have terrible reaction time they've been awake for a while, and I'm I needn't sleep already, honestly

2729
02:38:45,540 --> 02:38:47,540
shattered

2730
02:38:50,500 --> 02:38:52,500
He's joking

2731
02:38:53,180 --> 02:38:58,660
Right hydrate not attack. Why did it that was I never hit attack

2732
02:38:59,980 --> 02:39:04,060
That was really not supposed to happen. I don't know what was going on there

2733
02:39:07,140 --> 02:39:09,140
I

2734
02:39:13,420 --> 02:39:17,060
Okay, a thousand, okay, that's the best I got oh

02:39:49,860 --> 02:39:53,660
Okay, okay, we both

02:54:48,700 --> 02:54:55,020
I'm not going on my own like this. This is terrifying. At least I can jump him a little bit. Are you gonna jump me?

2904
02:54:56,620 --> 02:54:58,940
Okay, we both missed each other. We're both embarrassed. Okay

2905
02:54:59,660 --> 02:55:05,180
Right, actually, I say I appear to be rather strong against enemies like this. Okay. Let's let me stand up. What are you?

2906
02:55:05,420 --> 02:55:07,420
Pull lever sure pull lever. Why not?

2907
02:55:10,300 --> 02:55:12,300

2908
02:55:12,700 --> 02:55:14,700

You can leave we'll just drop you the with weapons

2910
02:55:22,460 --> 02:55:25,260
You mean I don't have to do this scary part all on my own

2911
02:55:25,820 --> 02:55:30,620
Don't have to tell me twice. I'm off. Goodbye. I'm off. It was lovely being here. No, really

2912
02:55:30,620 --> 02:55:35,260
I like what you've done with the place the feng shui and everything gorgeous, but I don't have to be here

2913
02:55:35,340 --> 02:55:37,340
I'm not being here. Bye

02:55:37,900 --> 02:55:43,660
Bye. Thank you. Oh, it's so lovely having you. Don't ever ever do that again. Okay. He he he he he

2915
02:55:45,660 --> 02:55:51,660
Is there a reason stony doesn't use a mimic? I don't have one. I never unlocked it. I've went straight into the dlc

2916
02:55:52,940 --> 02:55:54,780
I don't have it on

2917
02:55:54,780 --> 02:55:56,460
place

2918
02:55:56,460 --> 02:55:58,460
Okay, now where did I go?

2919
02:56:00,540 --> 02:56:02,540
I'm not going against them

2920
02:56:04,380 --> 02:56:10,220
I should have just said piece out. Oh, he's waiting on me. I'm here go to cerulean coast

I'm here. Do you have the scissors bonfires?

2923
02:56:19,820 --> 02:56:21,820
I don't know

2924
02:56:21,980 --> 02:56:25,580
Oh, it's the clever place. Okay cerulean coast

2925
02:56:27,180 --> 02:56:29,420
Uh, it's the bottom one down here

I marked out everyone's name for that last one because I did that did not count that should did not count

2927
02:56:40,060 --> 02:56:43,180
Math have you been in? You just dropped me stuff so you just can. Math

2928
02:56:52,460 --> 02:56:54,460
Wait what?

2929
02:56:54,620 --> 02:56:56,220
Touch cross

2930
02:56:56,220 --> 02:56:59,420
Carved work. I love that. I abandon here my doubts and

2931
02:57:00,380 --> 02:57:04,220
Vasillation. I don't even know what vasillation means. Okay, the only vaseline

2932
02:57:05,100 --> 02:57:11,980
Okay, I ruined the joke. I'm sorry. My brain was coming up with a punch line and it didn't work. Okay

2933
02:57:13,500 --> 02:57:15,820
It didn't work. I admit it

2934
02:57:16,540 --> 02:57:18,540
right

2935
02:57:21,180 --> 02:57:23,180

A smit script dagger. Wait, I'm gonna I'm changing a dick. I'll count. Why can't I wield it?

2938
02:57:34,460 --> 02:57:36,460
I need faith and intelligence

2939
02:57:37,180 --> 02:57:40,700
Danny you go to that lady with a golden blob

2940
02:57:42,780 --> 02:57:47,020
And respect the golden blob let's you respect doesn't she?

I need to see her mohen. Why do you need to talk to my mom with a punch? No, look trust me right where we go

2943
02:57:58,780 --> 02:58:00,780
Vasillation going back and forth between

2944
02:58:01,580 --> 02:58:03,500
two choices

2945
02:58:03,500 --> 02:58:05,660
So front door or back door

2946
02:58:08,060 --> 02:58:09,260
Little bit of

2947
02:58:09,260 --> 02:58:11,260
Vasillation

2948
02:58:11,660 --> 02:58:14,220
Okay, where what we're in how?

Oh, I'll put that on for now actually

2951
02:58:26,940 --> 02:58:28,940
You get a throwable weapon like an axe

2952
02:58:28,940 --> 02:58:30,940
My axe

2953
02:58:31,420 --> 02:58:37,820

Mummy they're boomerang weapons like Thor's hammer from more

2957
02:58:53,180 --> 02:58:56,700
Maybe we go back to main game so I can respect and put that on

2958
02:58:57,340 --> 02:58:59,340
Oh, there's baddies

2959
02:58:59,900 --> 02:59:02,300
Baddies over here reeflings roll out

2960
02:59:04,620 --> 02:59:07,900
They did physical damage, but range as well. Oh my god

2961
02:59:08,780 --> 02:59:12,060
You mean I can not be useless for my team

2962
02:59:12,940 --> 02:59:21,500
Okay, I'll do it whatever it takes. I'll make sure to respect for the reeflings. They're counting on me

2963
02:59:22,460 --> 02:59:24,860
And it's the best I got for ash kitchen

2964
02:59:25,340 --> 02:59:31,980
Oh away against him or do we not need to go against him the worms are angry. I repeat the worms are angry

2965
02:59:34,060 --> 02:59:36,060
There's blue jane

2966
02:59:37,260 --> 02:59:43,980
They're really angry. What did you do? I what's that frost? I don't know what that is

2967
02:59:45,260 --> 02:59:48,620
Knock it off. Right. We're coming to kill you first. You're annoying us

2968
02:59:52,060 --> 02:59:55,180
Stop it. You're killing us

2969
02:59:57,180 --> 02:59:59,900
Wait, does he just keep throwing the thing? No

2970
03:00:02,140 --> 03:00:07,980
Leave my refland alone. He didn't mean it. It was a mistake. Okay. Yeah, take that you stinker

2971
03:00:10,540 --> 03:00:14,940
I had the enemy reflands help then wait, can you do damage to mpc?

2972
03:00:14,940 --> 03:00:16,940
I

2973
03:00:20,380 --> 03:00:25,260
He was annoying a hefty cracked pot. Whoa. Oh, I like that

2974
03:00:29,660 --> 03:00:34,140
Idea for a follow-up for the pregnant and you ASMR your tapeworm and your girlfriend's tummy

2975
03:00:35,500 --> 03:00:37,820
Oh, that's really shit post there

2976
03:00:38,540 --> 03:00:40,540
I

2977
03:00:40,940 --> 03:00:42,940
I'm getting the microphone

2978
03:00:42,940 --> 03:00:47,180
Delivered it's just like those apple headphones. I'm just having to record it like that

2979
03:00:47,980 --> 03:00:48,860
and

2980
03:00:48,860 --> 03:00:51,980
I basically was going to do a youtube version

2981
03:00:53,260 --> 03:00:57,420
And it was like in utero ASMR, but no you really are basically

2982
03:00:58,300 --> 03:01:01,820
But then there was going to be an alternative twitter version

2983
03:01:02,620 --> 03:01:04,620
which was

2984
03:01:04,620 --> 03:01:06,620
Um

2985
03:01:06,620 --> 03:01:10,540
I'll do something and see if it sounds different when

2986
03:01:11,500 --> 03:01:18,460
I ain't basically I'm not sure if it would sound different. Maybe like because it squeezes down maybe them or youtube like

2987
03:01:21,340 --> 03:01:23,340
Oh, is that not

2988
03:01:24,300 --> 03:01:29,260
Oh, I'm to go down. Okay. I'm to go down

2989
03:01:30,220 --> 03:01:32,220
Oh

2990
03:01:32,540 --> 03:01:38,940
Bold choice. Thank you refland. You're gonna get teleported you giver. Oh, no, you died. Oh

2991
03:01:41,500 --> 03:01:45,340
I don't think I should count the ones where we walk around and you're showing me where to go

2992
03:01:45,500 --> 03:01:51,260
I think that's cheat suited on. I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna count your names on the list. That's not really fair

2993
03:01:54,700 --> 03:01:56,700
Okay

2994
03:02:00,140 --> 03:02:06,620
Oh another platform here. Oh, I never saw it. Okay. I'm gonna apologize. God that's quaint the disc

2995
03:02:11,740 --> 03:02:13,740
Don't do that

2996
03:02:16,220 --> 03:02:20,620
Don't do that. Don't do that. Don't put enemies

2997
03:02:20,620 --> 03:02:22,620
Don't

2998
03:02:25,980 --> 03:02:29,900
Oh my god, stop. I can hear them. Don't randomly put enemies

2999
03:02:33,420 --> 03:02:40,140
Okay, that looks correct. I'm like trying to very gently make my way down making my way down

3000
03:02:41,820 --> 03:02:48,060
And is it out? Oh, I just fall damaged it. Yeah, take that. Yeah, take that fall damage a little slain you

3001
03:02:49,020 --> 03:02:52,460
Okay, hold on gently gently ease

3002
03:02:55,100 --> 03:02:57,500
We're not winning a race over here. We're not winning a race

3003
03:02:59,420 --> 03:03:03,900
What happens if I whack them? I said what happens if I whack them?

3004
03:03:05,420 --> 03:03:10,140
Okay, they just splurge a little bit. Sorry. I think they like that. I think they're into that honestly

3005
03:03:11,180 --> 03:03:15,660
Oh, look at my refunds already picked me up on the other side. That's so cute

3006
03:03:19,020 --> 03:03:24,300
Uh a couple of levels maybe torn if I use torn I feel like I would have been tumbling off the map

3007
03:03:25,580 --> 03:03:28,380
Right, when did that? I'm just gonna check with new names here

3008
03:03:31,660 --> 03:03:33,660
I don't think you've come in

3009
03:03:39,260 --> 03:03:41,260
Unless you have none

3010
03:03:49,020 --> 03:03:51,020
I have no idea what's ahead

3011
03:03:51,500 --> 03:03:54,700
So you're coming in to protect me on ironic loop

3012
03:03:55,660 --> 03:03:59,580
I don't know what's ahead. So you're gonna have to walk me through it

3013
03:04:01,500 --> 03:04:03,500
I may level up if I

3014
03:04:04,540 --> 03:04:08,460
Isn't it not the golden blob women the mum of my wife

3015
03:04:09,100 --> 03:04:10,140
That

3016
03:04:10,140 --> 03:04:14,860
Will inspect me because I could just take some stuff off because I have like a cabillion

3017
03:04:15,420 --> 03:04:22,060
Like mass that so I have like a 99 strength, which I think is like pointless like really near the end

3018
03:04:23,180 --> 03:04:25,180
Okay, now what?

3019
03:04:25,580 --> 03:04:30,780
Go this way. I can hardly see get that get that lamp on. Yeah, there we go now. I can see

3020
03:04:33,660 --> 03:04:35,660
Into the cave

3021
03:04:36,460 --> 03:04:38,460
Charge

3022
03:04:38,940 --> 03:04:44,540
Queen Rena. Aye the mum of Rihanna are sorry. Uh, there's too many ours

3023
03:04:45,500 --> 03:04:48,300
Someone was like, oh, there's another loading stone

3024
03:04:49,580 --> 03:04:53,420
Um, someone was oh, I can't claim it. Oh, it's because you're too close to me. There we go

3025
03:04:54,620 --> 03:04:58,400
Hydration check. Okay. I'm hydrating. I'm hydrating plop plop plop plop

3026
03:05:02,300 --> 03:05:04,300
I've hydrated so hard. Oh, yeah

3027
03:05:04,940 --> 03:05:06,780
Hmm

3028
03:05:06,780 --> 03:05:11,500
You can just drop some rooms if you need some more levels. I don't know. I feel like my levels are far too much

3029
03:05:12,460 --> 03:05:15,340
I should give me big boy rooms like that

3030
03:05:17,660 --> 03:05:19,660
Oh, sorry, sorry

3031
03:05:19,740 --> 03:05:24,300
I I didn't know what you were doing. How do you do that? What are you pressing to shuffle?

3032
03:05:25,180 --> 03:05:27,180
Are they just moving forward a little bit?

3033
03:05:28,380 --> 03:05:30,620
No, why are they pressing to do that?

3034
03:05:33,980 --> 03:05:37,340
The only mother I'm familiar with is Queen America spam block

3035
03:05:39,420 --> 03:05:41,420
Oh

3036
03:05:41,900 --> 03:05:43,100
I

3037
03:05:43,100 --> 03:05:45,100
Oh my god, I can give you head pass

3038
03:05:54,620 --> 03:05:57,180
This is the most wholesome interaction so far

3039
03:05:57,980 --> 03:06:02,460
Oh, there's a gap down there. Don't go that way. Oh, there's a big boy

3040
03:06:03,660 --> 03:06:07,180
Oh, right. What are we dealing with? What are we looking at? What kind of?

3041
03:06:07,580 --> 03:06:09,580
Oh

3042
03:06:09,660 --> 03:06:14,620
Yeah, nice try nice try. Sorry. It had to be this way. Sorry

3043
03:06:16,380 --> 03:06:18,380
It's not our fault. Okay

3044
03:06:23,020 --> 03:06:27,260
I have stacked 99 because of hero runes. Is there an exploit?

3045
03:06:31,660 --> 03:06:35,340
That was a devastating kill. Didn't stand a chance. That's something together

3046
03:06:35,340 --> 03:06:38,140
We're so strong, but when I'm on my one, I'm so weak literally

3047
03:06:44,700 --> 03:06:46,700
Why would they do that

3048
03:06:48,060 --> 03:06:49,580
Why would they

3049
03:06:49,580 --> 03:06:51,580
No, I'm actually region

3050
03:06:52,300 --> 03:06:56,300
Why would they do that? They give me a fright from the reason I was like, oh, well there goes my runes

3051
03:06:56,300 --> 03:06:58,300
I'm gonna have to summon them in all over again

3052
03:06:58,940 --> 03:07:02,300
Okay, right. Let's freaking beat up these guys. I've had enough years

3053
03:07:03,100 --> 03:07:05,740
You're shitty poise

3054
03:07:07,020 --> 03:07:09,020
Get out of here

3055
03:07:09,340 --> 03:07:12,940
Get out of here. Wait, what's that blue thing? That's not gross

3056
03:07:13,660 --> 03:07:16,620
What's the blue thing? What's the matter with these blizzards?

3057
03:07:18,140 --> 03:07:20,140
Jump scare drop one

3058
03:07:20,220 --> 03:07:24,380
This game can't get enough of it. They're like, oh scare her. Oh, it's sleep

3059
03:07:25,260 --> 03:07:27,260
Thank you. I am rather tired

3060
03:07:27,420 --> 03:07:29,420
I

3061
03:07:29,740 --> 03:07:38,060

3142
03:13:03,180 --> 03:13:08,140
What the fuck I have to kill this? I don't know. I'm gonna run around it

3143
03:13:10,060 --> 03:13:12,300
For safety reasons. I'm running

03:13:17,740 --> 03:13:20,220
Oh, I sure as sure doesn't look like it

3146
03:13:22,140 --> 03:13:27,180
Okay, it sure doesn't look like it. I didn't know shadows can have fate in elden ring. Jeez

3147
03:13:29,180 --> 03:13:32,940
Multi-layered ring of late. I'll show you my ring

3148
03:13:35,580 --> 03:13:37,580
Why yes, of course

3149
03:13:40,780 --> 03:13:42,620
Uh, I didn't even know there was a gap there

3150
03:13:42,620 --> 03:13:47,740
So that was really lucky that my gamer instinct came in for that jumper else. I would have been raging tea

3151
03:13:48,940 --> 03:13:53,420
Although we wouldn't have had to have gone far back because we did unlock a new

3152
03:13:54,380 --> 03:13:56,380
location

3153
03:13:56,460 --> 03:14:03,660
Is your ring of leg listening? I would spend it funny. I I swear I saw something that was like if you spread your cheeks in the sunlight

3154
03:14:04,220 --> 03:14:06,220
Uh, oh no, what?

3155
03:14:08,140 --> 03:14:11,500
Uh, this looks really not nice

3156
03:14:13,260 --> 03:14:15,260
Are they alive?

3157
03:14:15,820 --> 03:14:17,820
They're just sleeping

3158
03:14:19,740 --> 03:14:21,740
Like in a trance

3159
03:14:22,860 --> 03:14:24,860
Huh

3161
03:14:29,340 --> 03:14:31,420
They're not alive. Oh, they're like statues

3162
03:14:34,860 --> 03:14:36,860
Okay, they're strange

3163
03:14:37,100 --> 03:14:45,340
What does analize the journey further go that way? Oh, no. Oh, no. I know what the mark of maraketh or whatever it is

But where's my reef lens?

3176

I'm speechless. I'm not even up

3177
03:16:24,780 --> 03:16:28,380
Um, I didn't even have a chance

Oh the horse is slain

3181
03:16:45,340 --> 03:16:47,340

03:16:47,740 --> 03:16:49,740
He does frostbite damage

3183
03:16:52,700 --> 03:16:58,620
I mean, we're all just trying our best to smash into them and I'm out of stamina

3184
03:16:59,100 --> 03:17:01,100
Huh

3185
03:17:01,420 --> 03:17:03,900
Whoa, I did not like that move

3186
03:17:05,660 --> 03:17:07,660
Oh and the horse got me

3187
03:17:08,700 --> 03:17:10,700
Whoa, what a unique boss

3188
03:17:12,300 --> 03:17:15,340
I hate it, but also like I love it at the same time

3189
03:17:18,860 --> 03:17:21,740
I am very uh, what's the word?

3190
03:17:29,500 --> 03:17:31,500

I

3194
03:17:53,820 --> 03:17:59,260
Yeah, this one is tricky

3195
03:18:03,820 --> 03:18:05,820
Oh, I didn't jump that time did I

3196
03:18:08,460 --> 03:18:13,740
No, and then the horse is gonna come in and get another triple hit on me. Oh, please let me hydrate, bro

3197
03:18:14,700 --> 03:18:19,340
Please. Oh, thank you reflin. Unfortunately. I'm out of heals now

03:18:20,780 --> 03:18:22,780
That's not gonna stop me

03:18:24,380 --> 03:18:26,380

Okay, let's oh no, this is the jump one jump bitch jump. No jump now

3201
03:18:35,740 --> 03:18:38,620
Shit. Okay. No, that wasn't it. I meant to jump. I'm just jumping

3202
03:18:39,180 --> 03:18:44,460
It is it's like hopscotch, but worse. This is like the worst game of jump rope I've ever played

3203
03:18:45,340 --> 03:18:47,340
Okay, no, I'm not gonna make it

3204
03:18:48,220 --> 03:18:50,220
For the replaying

3205
03:18:52,220 --> 03:18:55,660
Okay, that was not bad that was not bad

3206
03:18:57,980 --> 03:18:59,980
That was not bad

3207
03:19:00,300 --> 03:19:02,300
I'm not mad at that

3208
03:19:02,380 --> 03:19:07,900
Um, so we should be at the last one. I'm gonna pinch a few Doritos

3209
03:19:08,860 --> 03:19:10,860
Uh

3210
03:19:12,860 --> 03:19:14,860
I'm moving my score

3211
03:19:22,300 --> 03:19:24,380
Oh, wait, so you died didn't you?

3212
03:19:26,220 --> 03:19:32,380
And then Revis you died really quickly. I remember it felt really bad for you

3213
03:19:38,620 --> 03:19:45,900
I'm eating away from the microphone, but mommy still loves you

3214
03:20:09,020 --> 03:20:11,020
Okay

3215
03:20:18,300 --> 03:20:20,940
I was struggling to find any crisps that enjoy

3216
03:20:21,900 --> 03:20:25,100
And I'm sure you but cheesy Doritos tastes pretty similar

3217
03:20:26,060 --> 03:20:28,060
So I need to do this jump every time

3218
03:20:28,700 --> 03:20:30,620
We

3219
03:20:30,620 --> 03:20:36,060
I guess this is a loading screen for the boss must be oh my camera just popped

3220
03:20:36,220 --> 03:20:38,220
Hmm

3221
03:20:39,740 --> 03:20:44,540
If you're in Britain, yeah, make sure you eat chili heat wave Doritos crisps on my behalf

3222
03:20:46,220 --> 03:20:49,740
Because those are my all-time favorite. Oh, I got my points back

3223
03:20:53,820 --> 03:20:55,820
All right, and then the horse comes running oh

3224
03:20:56,620 --> 03:20:59,020
I dodged the horse, but then I got hit by him. Oh and I

3225
03:20:59,260 --> 03:21:00,380
Oh

3226
03:21:00,380 --> 03:21:02,700
Bro, the reeflings aren't even gonna make it down by the time

3227
03:21:03,580 --> 03:21:05,580
I'm literally

3228
03:21:05,820 --> 03:21:08,300
Oh my god, this is who

3229
03:21:09,420 --> 03:21:11,580
Who would be so cruel to do that?

3230
03:21:15,260 --> 03:21:21,500
Who would be so cruel I've literally not got a whack on him. You've got this I'm getting annihilated

3231
03:21:29,500 --> 03:21:31,500
Okay

3232
03:21:37,580 --> 03:21:39,580
Okay

3233
03:21:41,900 --> 03:21:45,420
Come on, okay, I've not done one thing to him yet

3234
03:21:47,820 --> 03:21:49,820
Okay knows my chance

3235
03:21:50,300 --> 03:21:53,740
Okay, I did it. I did one damage the rest is up to you

3236
03:21:55,500 --> 03:21:57,500
No pressure

3237
03:21:57,580 --> 03:21:59,580
Oh, he doesn't have legs

3238
03:21:59,820 --> 03:22:01,820
He's just got we bony things

3239
03:22:02,860 --> 03:22:04,860
Heal me hydro

3240
03:22:05,740 --> 03:22:07,740
Sorry, I might have to take off my

3241
03:22:09,500 --> 03:22:12,940
My pullover in a second because I'm getting really freaking hot in this room

3242
03:22:14,620 --> 03:22:16,620
Yeah

3243
03:22:18,140 --> 03:22:24,860
I am very amused by this boss, but when he gets into that second phase attack is like baruto

3244
03:22:27,900 --> 03:22:30,780
He doesn't seem to take any staggers either

3245
03:22:32,540 --> 03:22:34,540
Nor does he take any prisoners

3246
03:22:37,180 --> 03:22:39,180
And

3247
03:22:41,100 --> 03:22:43,100
Mo

3248
03:22:43,260 --> 03:22:46,780
I could see that coming on. Oh no, he's doing the thing jump

3249
03:22:47,500 --> 03:22:52,940
Time to play jump rope. I love jump rope. I love playing jump rope. Oh my god jump rope so fun

3252
03:23:01,020 --> 03:23:04,380
No, Riefenstein you are so

3253
03:23:07,420 --> 03:23:09,420
He's mine

3254
03:23:10,380 --> 03:23:12,380
No

3255
03:23:13,740 --> 03:23:15,500

before stream like I've been trying to give them what they need right before stream I just feel

3296
03:27:55,300 --> 03:28:03,140
really bad but it's like the first time where the fuck is yellow Goku whatever your name is

3297

3298
03:28:14,540 --> 03:28:18,940
up for four hours before stream and I just feel really bad like I'm not like super hyper and

3302
03:28:35,700 --> 03:28:46,100

3303
03:28:46,100 --> 03:28:53,780

3312
03:30:14,140 --> 03:30:20,140
that have the purple things that are with general grievous that's what I think when I think of like

two-handed weapon well he did not want me he was coming for the rifling booty he was like no I can

3320
03:31:10,860 --> 03:31:15,900
no okay like see that that's not contributing that's just taking wallops for no reason

3321
03:31:16,620 --> 03:31:17,980
it's not even an aggro

3322
03:31:19,980 --> 03:31:22,940

03:32:58,620 --> 03:33:00,380
easy peasy lemon school you see

3337
03:33:02,060 --> 03:33:05,340

3338
03:33:06,140 --> 03:33:13,660
I don't think I've had is there anyone new that hasn't had a shot let me

3339
03:33:13,660 --> 03:33:20,460
utilize the names first actually there's a chance the new rifling's managed to get off the work or

3340
03:33:20,460 --> 03:33:27,900
oh you look new kheh kheh arn khorn more like khorn muh

3341
03:33:28,780 --> 03:33:36,220

3342
03:33:37,580 --> 03:33:40,940
oh me when I'm the last one left and I have to finish the mission

3343
03:33:41,900 --> 03:33:46,300
would you let a streamsnipe a monster hunter apparently it's a good streamsnipe game

3344
03:33:46,300 --> 03:33:53,180
I've just never played it before I played it for like 15 minutes and I was like um yes

3345
03:33:53,180 --> 03:33:58,540
interesting game concept tea and I was more like carrying on the cab

3346
03:33:59,580 --> 03:34:04,860
shlop on mi nob like khorn on the cob then she gave me head right on the bed

3347
03:34:06,060 --> 03:34:13,660
um yeah okay okay let's do it surely I'm not gonna get walloped

3348
03:34:14,620 --> 03:34:19,820
first hit is always a delayed hit then after that good luck figuring out what freaking attack

3349
03:34:19,820 --> 03:34:25,260
pattern he's doing you know at least just he's gonna come trampling in

3350
03:34:26,460 --> 03:34:36,060
me right and then it's gonna be a slow swing okay delayed and then whatever attack pattern

3351
03:34:36,060 --> 03:34:42,060
comes next I don't know I'm just waiting for the refunds to drop in to be honest that hit

3352
03:34:42,460 --> 03:34:50,700
huh I honestly felt like that shouldn't have but hey who that's the way and I walked right into that one

3353
03:34:54,380 --> 03:35:00,460
okay I'm getting a bit better oh the fucking horse came back twice he can do the horse please

3354
03:35:03,740 --> 03:35:10,060
I didn't know the horse could get it up twice I'm so sorry I didn't know the horse could get it up

3355
03:35:10,060 --> 03:35:16,460
twice are you serious I was like oh my god I got it I'm getting so good at his attack pattern dies

3356
03:35:22,940 --> 03:35:27,740
spin I am spin I'm gonna mark off the two refunds for the last one because that looks

3357
03:35:27,740 --> 03:35:36,860
not an attempt that was just an embarrassment as in I am speed is there any new refunds that

3358
03:35:36,860 --> 03:35:43,420
haven't had is it you had a chance to we better go congrats the

3359
03:35:46,620 --> 03:35:48,220
who is motherfucking

3360
03:35:50,300 --> 03:35:54,620
is there not a new one am I going mental was there not a new reason is it you

3361
03:35:56,540 --> 03:36:02,460
no oh you just had it right you just had a chance but it went fucking shade in that

3362
03:36:02,700 --> 03:36:11,100
huh okay let's try that again but this time we now know the horse can get it up twice okay

3363
03:36:12,700 --> 03:36:15,740
practice a lot and you will do more than to keep damage real

3364
03:36:16,540 --> 03:36:24,780
can you do me depends what you mean okay we're getting a blessing I'll take the blessing

3365
03:36:25,740 --> 03:36:33,580
the boss goes three times and the horse goes twice okay right horse can

3366
03:36:33,580 --> 03:36:38,540
horse can gallop twice I don't know if my brain just like cut out all the other times the horse

3367
03:36:38,540 --> 03:36:45,420
gallop twice but I was like I've not seen this attack pattern he went in it twice oh my god he

3368
03:36:45,420 --> 03:36:47,900
didn't go back on his horse with these stubborn legs

3369
03:36:50,540 --> 03:36:58,860
oh can I rotate you spin me right round baby right round oh my god imagine if I found an exploit

3370
03:36:58,860 --> 03:37:08,780
where the boss is himself instantly because he did a little 360 okay this is named sperm stadium

3371
03:37:08,780 --> 03:37:14,700
right delete dodge okay that was far too early but it's still working somehow

3372
03:37:15,660 --> 03:37:21,340
someplace somewhere okay I'm gonna just keep dodging well well I've done it now

3373
03:37:22,380 --> 03:37:26,300
hold on a minute hold on a minute reflins are gonna take aggro hold on a minute

3374
03:37:26,300 --> 03:37:31,100
there we go they're gonna take aggro and then I can heal okay and one big swing

3375
03:37:31,340 --> 03:37:33,740
and get jumped by the reflins

3376
03:37:36,060 --> 03:37:41,180
oh he doesn't seem to take any stagger though all right there are bosses that take stagger

3377
03:37:41,180 --> 03:37:46,140
surely it's just a lot to break their poise I think maybe

3378
03:37:48,540 --> 03:37:53,740
okay ultimate oh that didn't work um hmm

3379
03:37:54,300 --> 03:37:54,800
hmm

3380

3440
03:45:09,500 --> 03:45:14,060
I wonder how someone discovered this the first time probably just brute force in it honestly

3441
03:45:19,500 --> 03:45:26,380
I don't get why the bloodstones are piled up in the corner maybe if you attack her she like

03:45:49,820 --> 03:45:56,060
do we come back to her once we've killed the god

3445
03:46:01,740 --> 03:46:06,620
I assume that's all she does for now but as you come back after you kill the god and she talks to

03:47:14,380 --> 03:47:18,940

3458
03:47:34,300 --> 03:47:39,980

You blew up my IP

3761
04:19:14,760 --> 04:19:20,120
It was that shocked by your architect strip suggestion. I do anyway. All right, so

3762
04:19:21,000 --> 04:19:23,000
and I

3763
04:19:23,000 --> 04:19:26,760
Was writing a script with the script writer showing them how I do it

3764
04:19:27,360 --> 04:19:29,760
and and they went like oh

3765
04:19:31,240 --> 04:19:36,320
Put your belly on my back or something like that and they were laughing

3766
04:19:36,320 --> 04:19:39,840
But I was like, oh, no, like I'm actually gonna write something like that

3767
04:19:40,520 --> 04:19:43,760
It was something like if it was like doggy style

3768
04:19:43,760 --> 04:19:48,240
You'd have to put your tummy on my back or something and I was like no no that's good

3769
04:19:50,160 --> 04:19:54,520
I was like I like that and but they really fucking beamin around

3770
04:19:56,360 --> 04:19:58,360
Holy shit, whoa

3771
04:19:59,760 --> 04:20:02,880
Whoa, my PC does not like this area. I

3772
04:20:03,880 --> 04:20:08,000
Don't know. I don't know if I need to turn it down or something

3773
04:20:09,960 --> 04:20:12,440
My PC's taking off right now, holy shit

3774
04:20:14,600 --> 04:20:18,000
None of your names counted for the ones who were in before

3775

Think I'm gonna tell it to go low for this area because literally my PC is ready to explore

3782
04:20:56,720 --> 04:21:03,600
Um, I don't know why I don't know. How do you dragon Russian death bitch?

3786
04:21:19,400 --> 04:21:21,560
Am I going crazy? Does that even apply?

3787
04:21:22,880 --> 04:21:24,880
My PC's quiet though

3788
04:21:26,720 --> 04:21:28,720

3789
04:21:29,840 --> 04:21:33,160
Maybe my eyes are just bad it doesn't even look that much different to me

3790

You need restart the game for it to take effect. Oh, whoops. Hi. Are you ready? Oh

Or is it safer a bit I

3800
04:22:35,080 --> 04:22:41,760
Could not imagine how much of an exercise it would be to be like crouched walking

3801
04:22:43,440 --> 04:22:45,440
Well, I'm just guessing

3802
04:22:46,160 --> 04:22:48,160

That's so creepy

3861
04:28:04,160 --> 04:28:06,160
Oh

3862
04:28:06,440 --> 04:28:11,800
There's two oh my god, I must help my reeflings I need to help I need to help oh my god

3863
04:28:11,800 --> 04:28:15,380
I need to help fuck you. Oh my god. Why are you locking on to the wrong one?

3864
04:28:17,080 --> 04:28:19,080
Shit shit. I

3865
04:28:20,000 --> 04:28:26,480
Thought I was helping. I made everything like ten times worse. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I made it ten times worse

3866
04:28:26,480 --> 04:28:28,480
I thought I was helping

3867
04:28:28,680 --> 04:28:30,680
Wait, what was last?

3868
04:28:31,000 --> 04:28:33,760
Stake of Marica did we walk past one of these?

3869
04:28:37,120 --> 04:28:42,880
Did we walk past one of them? I don't know the stake of Marica sure if I can load me now

3870
04:28:42,880 --> 04:28:44,880
It's not a good for me. Oh

3871
04:28:46,560 --> 04:28:50,160
I'm gonna stash power. What about cheeks in front of me? Oh

3872
04:28:52,840 --> 04:28:58,120
No, no one's here. Oh god, I never even spotted this. Okay, we're right like at the bomb bit here

3873
04:28:58,480 --> 04:29:00,480
I

3874
04:29:01,280 --> 04:29:03,280
Am helping everyone dies

3875
04:29:03,400 --> 04:29:05,200
classics run

3876
04:29:05,200 --> 04:29:07,040
These are the last two in this area

3877
04:29:07,040 --> 04:29:12,180
You can only damage them if you parry them first the way you're meant to play the section is sneaking through the tall grass

3878
04:29:12,440 --> 04:29:14,440
Like a silk in

3879
04:29:15,320 --> 04:29:17,880
Why give me big sword to not swing

3880
04:29:18,720 --> 04:29:20,200
Why ya?

3881
04:29:20,200 --> 04:29:23,960
Then you to go back to the other I think I might need to go back to the other great site. Oh

3882
04:29:24,520 --> 04:29:26,520
Oh, no, we filmed that me

3883
04:29:27,520 --> 04:29:29,520
Okay, let's see my

3884
04:29:34,920 --> 04:29:37,640
Another reflin and then an evil reflin

3885
04:29:39,720 --> 04:29:41,720
I'll put that

3886
04:29:42,400 --> 04:29:44,400
Never

3887
04:29:44,760 --> 04:29:46,760
There be the last two

3888
04:29:47,800 --> 04:29:54,720
Well, yeah, are these susceptible to rot me me I something like that. I hear you

3889
04:29:55,720 --> 04:29:57,720
Just

3890
04:30:00,880 --> 04:30:06,440
And then I don't think we have an evil reflin here, I don't think it won't let me

3891
04:30:11,200 --> 04:30:13,200
Stealth or fate oh

3892
04:30:14,440 --> 04:30:16,440
Fates so I can get past

3893
04:30:18,600 --> 04:30:20,600
And I'll come in and I go watch out

3894
04:30:21,360 --> 04:30:26,360
And that's my job done. Oh evil refling who's not being evil

3895
04:30:37,880 --> 04:30:39,880
Okay, and then

3896
04:30:40,040 --> 04:30:46,000
Wait, should I put that jump talisman on enhanced attack with 200 weapons boosts

3897
04:30:47,280 --> 04:30:49,280
Holy

3898
04:30:50,600 --> 04:30:52,600
I could do that jump one

3899
04:30:53,520 --> 04:30:55,520
Because all I do is go wha bam

3900
04:30:56,440 --> 04:31:00,120
So I feel like it'd be really why is your sword longer than mine

3901
04:31:01,600 --> 04:31:03,600
You guys always have bigger swords in

3902
04:31:05,720 --> 04:31:09,280
Okay, I think we're going in guns ablaze in maybe

3903
04:31:10,520 --> 04:31:12,520
so you guys need to

3904
04:31:13,280 --> 04:31:17,600
Go fight and then dodge and then attack and

3905
04:31:18,360 --> 04:31:22,400
Or else you won't be able to hurt them at all. So make sure you parry them

3906
04:31:23,960 --> 04:31:25,960
Surely this will go well

3907
04:31:26,400 --> 04:31:29,160
Okay, we've been spotted. That's okay. Oh

3908
04:31:30,840 --> 04:31:34,800
One of them is like behind there we must dodge

3909
04:31:41,640 --> 04:31:43,640
Oh my gosh, I

3910
04:31:44,480 --> 04:31:46,480
Can't

3911
04:31:50,480 --> 04:31:52,480
My gosh

3912
04:31:52,680 --> 04:31:54,680
Leave it to the reef flings

3913
04:31:55,560 --> 04:31:57,560
They don't give up

3914
04:31:57,760 --> 04:32:01,800
They do not care these we do not care music, please

3915
04:32:04,040 --> 04:32:07,000
Sword envy minds me

3916
04:32:13,640 --> 04:32:15,640
Oh

3917
04:32:27,840 --> 04:32:37,320
Where we're going I'm a fellow roll out recently. Yes, sir. No, it's safe to go through this madness infested area

3918
04:32:38,320 --> 04:32:40,320
I

3919
04:32:42,320 --> 04:32:47,320
Touch it. No, what what happens after I touch it

3920
04:32:57,680 --> 04:33:04,760
I'm just falling. There's a sac-a-dew fairing fragment we missed in this area

3921
04:33:07,440 --> 04:33:10,920
Do you need them all there I put that animal of his misery

3922
04:33:12,480 --> 04:33:15,840
And it's got madness and that's not it should be free

3923
04:33:21,040 --> 04:33:26,280
What the other reason go people sauce is he disconnected

3924
04:33:32,800 --> 04:33:34,800
I'm helping

3925
04:33:38,080 --> 04:33:42,760
It helps you hit harder and take better hits. Oh, maybe I should go for a little bit

3926
04:33:43,560 --> 04:33:47,080
Did you know scatoos just the old English spelling of shadow?

3927
04:33:48,160 --> 04:33:50,160
scato

3928
04:33:54,000 --> 04:33:58,840
I can lead the way there. Oh, is this you in game?

3929
04:34:01,520 --> 04:34:06,440
Hold on read I think red roof one is this you in game. Oh, right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay

3930
04:34:07,320 --> 04:34:12,000
One-second enemy reflin. We're just going to get a

3931
04:34:13,040 --> 04:34:15,040
Scadoo

3932
04:34:16,480 --> 04:34:18,480
We're gonna get a scadoo real quick, okay

3933
04:34:19,960 --> 04:34:26,840
The wooshie finger hold we need to watch constant and I've not seen two or three apparently is the third one

3934
04:34:27,720 --> 04:34:29,720
I want to grab it. Oh

3935
04:34:31,360 --> 04:34:36,720
It's a notification thing. Oops. That's supposed to trip you up with the sunflowers

3936
04:34:37,520 --> 04:34:39,680
Do you like kung fu panda because he's chubby?

3937
04:34:40,720 --> 04:34:44,720
I'm not gonna shag a fucking panda. What no, I don't

3938
04:34:47,640 --> 04:34:50,140
Do you mean like the character pole? I

3939
04:34:52,360 --> 04:34:55,240
Just I just think it's a good character

3940
04:34:56,680 --> 04:35:01,640
Wait, I'm 15 minutes behind now in game in stream

3941
04:35:02,200 --> 04:35:11,520
God we really missed that this is a trek and I have we'll come back radar refling. I promise. Are you behind me?

3942
04:35:13,760 --> 04:35:16,000
Is there a radar reflin active I

3943
04:35:17,480 --> 04:35:22,680
Feel like that you get teleported the further we go from here. What was that?

3944
04:35:27,680 --> 04:35:29,680
Monka

3945
04:35:31,880 --> 04:35:33,880
Mmm

3946
04:35:36,680 --> 04:35:41,160
Climbing up the hill, okay got a few things to be up

3947
04:35:47,120 --> 04:35:49,120
Okay, okay, okay

3948
04:35:50,520 --> 04:35:56,000
You madness some madness some badness combination

3949
04:35:56,000 --> 04:35:58,000
I

3950
04:35:59,400 --> 04:36:04,200
Guess I'll say to everyone refresh just in case you're streaming will be me

3951
04:36:05,040 --> 04:36:07,040
being a stinky boo winky

3952
04:36:08,360 --> 04:36:10,040
Little lay behind

3953
04:36:10,040 --> 04:36:14,720
Whoa, why is it you're your weapons are so much color than mine?

3954
04:36:16,120 --> 04:36:18,120
my just

3955
04:36:21,320 --> 04:36:24,160
My did the reasons have killer stuff than me

3956
04:36:26,000 --> 04:36:29,600
Oh, this is it. Okay. Okay. Oh, there's the enemy

3957
04:36:30,680 --> 04:36:36,040
We did it. We did okay next time. I need to call in the refunds

3958
04:36:36,040 --> 04:36:39,600
I will remember to put my defense and attack up because I keep forgetting to do it

3959
04:36:41,240 --> 04:36:44,240
Your sword is cool for some time that also happens

3960
04:36:47,000 --> 04:36:52,400
Cuz Johnny they went out and farmed for them. What do you mean? I'm farming so hard right now

3961
04:36:52,400 --> 04:36:59,200
I'm telling the soil. I'm watering the crops. I'm putting a little bit fertilizer down, but not too much

3962
04:37:00,080 --> 04:37:02,080
you know that most and

3963
04:37:02,560 --> 04:37:06,640
Things that like destroy wheat. Oh a bit of football and

3964
04:37:07,720 --> 04:37:09,720
Those things that destroy

3965
04:37:10,360 --> 04:37:18,120
Like weeds in that, you know what they actually do they tell the plant to overgrow past its resources

3966
04:37:18,240 --> 04:37:21,040
You know how it gets like yellowy and long and stringy

3967
04:37:22,400 --> 04:37:25,960
When you put weed killer down, that's because it tells it to

3968
04:37:26,840 --> 04:37:32,040
Do it to itself and it grows out of control like that's how weed killers work. It's pretty fast

3969
04:37:34,040 --> 04:37:35,560
I

3970
04:37:35,560 --> 04:37:37,800
Wonder if you could do it to a human body. I

3971
04:37:38,680 --> 04:37:42,680
Suppose that would be too much steroids. They say steroids are really bad for you over time

3972
04:37:42,720 --> 04:37:45,280
Like you get an enlarged heart and perish

3973
04:37:45,280 --> 04:37:49,000
So I guess that would be the equivalent of on a large enlarged heart in a human

3974
04:37:49,400 --> 04:37:51,920
Am I going the right way? Sorry. I'm just rambling

3975
04:37:52,480 --> 04:37:54,480
All right, I'm standing

3976
04:37:57,840 --> 04:37:59,840
This boss is one of the easier one

3977
04:38:00,760 --> 04:38:03,480
We films work in the field when mommy's sipping on tea on the porch

3978
04:38:03,480 --> 04:38:06,320
I get to read my books while watching over you

3979
04:38:06,760 --> 04:38:11,200
You tend into the chicken and you get the fresh eggs and then we'll have

3980
04:38:12,080 --> 04:38:17,960
I'm not made omelet. I can make myself scrambled egg. Have a scrambled egg with like bacon and stuff in it

3981
04:38:18,960 --> 04:38:25,640
That's neat, but that's also how cancer work that goes for the sake of growth. Okay. Yeah. No, that's not just no

3982
04:38:25,640 --> 04:38:28,400
That's true. That's true. That's definitely true

3983
04:38:31,200 --> 04:38:40,040
Wait, how am I getting mad? Oh, I'm getting bitten. Oopsies the rats are winning. I'm not paying attention

3984
04:38:48,920 --> 04:38:54,600
Uh, who am I following? User splitting up. No, all right

3985
04:38:56,680 --> 04:38:59,480
It seemed to have a consensus of this location

3986
04:39:02,600 --> 04:39:07,880
Hmm, hmm studying analizing pointing we're pointing

3987
04:39:09,160 --> 04:39:12,680
We're pointing we're pointing. Okay, we're pointing. We're pointing so hard right now

3988
04:39:13,640 --> 04:39:21,840
Don't send us back to the farm. No, the farm's a good thing for us. It's not a bad thing. I promise the farm's a good thing for us. Oh

3989
04:39:25,280 --> 04:39:27,520
The farm is where we am

3990
04:39:28,400 --> 04:39:31,200
Get milk. Well, I milk you

3991
04:39:31,800 --> 04:39:33,440
Can you milk me?

3992
04:39:33,440 --> 04:39:38,760
No, you don't milk me. What do you do to me? You slain me. You made me slain so hard

3993
04:39:39,640 --> 04:39:41,640
at the far

3994
04:39:42,680 --> 04:39:44,680
Okay, what's up ahead?

3995
04:39:45,880 --> 04:39:51,560
Make a scrambled egg with bacon, please. We'll maybe finish him. Yeah, I'll do like those pick and mix bars

3996
04:39:51,960 --> 04:39:53,960
What does that mean halt go no further

3997
04:39:55,000 --> 04:39:56,280
I don't

3998
04:39:56,280 --> 04:39:57,720
get poses

3999
04:39:57,720 --> 04:39:58,920
um

4000
04:39:58,920 --> 04:40:04,120
I did one of those like pick your own things like I'll make the scrambled egg and I'll make the bacon in advance and I'll do like

4001
04:40:04,680 --> 04:40:10,360
Grilled tomato you can add or pan fried tomato pan fried peppers

4002
04:40:11,240 --> 04:40:13,240
There's something I do not like this

4003
04:40:16,040 --> 04:40:18,040
Oh, I don't like that. Oh

4004
04:40:18,280 --> 04:40:20,280
Yeah, something's got me

4005
04:40:20,360 --> 04:40:24,600
Something's got me. I'm getting shagged. Oh, you never freaking warned me

4006
04:40:27,960 --> 04:40:32,520
I'm dead. I'm about to get madness incarnated unless unless

4007
04:40:34,960 --> 04:40:36,960
Unless

4008
04:40:37,200 --> 04:40:40,640
Um, I'm mad. I've got madness. What does it mean? What does it mean?

4009
04:40:43,840 --> 04:40:46,240
I got inflicted with it. What happens now?

4010
04:40:50,080 --> 04:40:55,600
I've heard these reeflings taking it. I don't know it just joined my manner rude

4011
04:40:55,600 --> 04:40:57,600
Ah

4012
04:41:03,200 --> 04:41:05,600
Deals damage over time and lowers magic

4013
04:41:06,240 --> 04:41:08,240
Okay

4014
04:41:14,240 --> 04:41:17,280
No, I mean we're out of the fog so that's the good news, right? Surely

4015
04:41:18,000 --> 04:41:20,000
I

4016
04:41:21,680 --> 04:41:23,680
The other refunds coming to

4017
04:41:24,240 --> 04:41:25,840
It's often

4018
04:41:25,840 --> 04:41:27,280
Is it in trouble?

4019
04:41:27,280 --> 04:41:29,280
Do you need help? Do you need mommy's help?

4020
04:41:30,240 --> 04:41:32,240
No, you're okay

4021
04:41:32,240 --> 04:41:35,760
You're just stressing me up because you can we are going in circles. We should head back

4022
04:41:36,320 --> 04:41:40,000
What are we actually going in circles? I can't open up my map

4023
04:41:41,120 --> 04:41:43,120
Fuck it. I'll actually alone blending

4024
04:41:43,360 --> 04:41:45,920
Do you like breakfast burritos like the kind of scrambled egg bacon?

4025
04:41:47,920 --> 04:41:53,200
I wish there was some takeaway place that would do that. I would love that kind of stuff

4026
04:41:55,360 --> 04:41:57,920
I want to do like home made

4027
04:41:59,360 --> 04:42:01,360
I heard you can freeze burritos

4028
04:42:02,240 --> 04:42:04,800
Um, because my soup went really well

4029
04:42:05,600 --> 04:42:10,960
And I wanted to try and freeze burritos for myself and then like I can just microwave them and then they're ready to go

4030
04:42:11,520 --> 04:42:13,520
How did we go the wrong way? I'm so confused

4031
04:42:14,400 --> 04:42:18,400
You took a wrong turn at some point. You shouldn't count another of those things

4032
04:42:22,160 --> 04:42:26,560
Try g y g if you have one near you, you'll get meant to know

4033
04:42:27,840 --> 04:42:29,840
Joe agi Joe agi

4034
04:42:30,640 --> 04:42:32,640
I don't think I've heard of this one Joe agi

4035
04:42:33,520 --> 04:42:37,360
Starbucks makes good ones. There is no starbucks in Australia

4036
04:42:38,560 --> 04:42:40,240
I mean there is

4037
04:42:40,240 --> 04:42:42,000
but

4038
04:42:42,000 --> 04:42:46,640
There is something about the quality of starbucks when I entered Australia that no one went to it

4039
04:42:46,640 --> 04:42:49,680
Like they don't like the coffee because it's low quality and stuff like that

4040
04:42:50,400 --> 04:42:53,760
So there's like me starbucks other than in tourist

4041
04:42:54,560 --> 04:42:56,320
locations

4042
04:42:56,320 --> 04:42:58,320
for familiarity

4043
04:42:59,840 --> 04:43:03,280
Guzman and Gomez there are Mexican chains

4044
04:43:04,240 --> 04:43:05,520
Oh

4045
04:43:05,520 --> 04:43:07,440
I've not tried them

4046
04:43:07,440 --> 04:43:09,440
Maybe I should

4047
04:43:10,000 --> 04:43:12,000
And before I discover it and I end up

4048
04:43:13,440 --> 04:43:16,720
Of that mummy's not losing weight no more. She gaining okay

4049
04:43:17,760 --> 04:43:22,000
She gaining it's all gonna matter. Well, I hope it would go in my ass if I was gaining weight, but

4050
04:43:23,440 --> 04:43:25,440
Considering I do no exercise

4051
04:43:26,720 --> 04:43:28,720
Although my only exercise is literally

4052
04:43:29,680 --> 04:43:31,680
Have you up bro anyway?

4053
04:43:32,240 --> 04:43:35,280
You just keep your candle blowing antics to yourself. Okay

4054
04:43:37,040 --> 04:43:39,040
I'm out of stamina for these fights

4055
04:43:39,520 --> 04:43:42,480
Yeah, you just you do just relax me. You just calm down mate

4056
04:43:43,680 --> 04:43:48,160
You just calm down. Ooh healing stone. Oh, I'm being healed so much right now

4057
04:43:51,680 --> 04:43:56,080
Head pat head pat. Oh, I've keep forgetting to head pat. No wrong one. Sorry. This is the head pat one

4058
04:43:56,640 --> 04:43:58,640
pat pat pat pat pat

4059
04:43:59,760 --> 04:44:01,760
When you get you an exercise bike

4060
04:44:01,760 --> 04:44:06,000
Well, I was gonna do a treadmill stream where it was just pointed at my butt and I was like

4061
04:44:06,320 --> 04:44:08,320
I think that's a bit outrageous to be honest

4062
04:44:09,600 --> 04:44:11,600
A little bit outrageous

4063
04:44:12,800 --> 04:44:14,480
Might be able to get away with it though

4064
04:44:14,480 --> 04:44:19,280
If it's like a small part of the stream and the rest is my vtuber model. Oh, no. Is this

4065
04:44:21,280 --> 04:44:22,880
Open

4066
04:44:22,880 --> 04:44:26,800
I've seen worse on twitch point at your feet and say I was gonna do a feet cam stream

4067
04:44:26,880 --> 04:44:31,440
But the problem is I never have my feet on the floor like it's literally against my penini right now

4068
04:44:32,000 --> 04:44:35,440
Sorry, I said I said I have it. Can enemy refling come in? You can

4069
04:44:39,520 --> 04:44:41,520
Close

4070
04:44:48,160 --> 04:44:50,640
I wonder if there's something with this painting. Hmm

4071
04:44:53,040 --> 04:44:55,520
Let me talk to this guy. Does he say anything?

Penini cam stream. Yeah, you wait. I'm not freaking doing a penini

4078
04:45:20,800 --> 04:45:25,760
I'll do a blue stream and you can hear my penini if you want

4079
04:45:31,440 --> 04:45:36,720

Am I going great? Oh, I opened this passage right?

4088

They're just bulls for my dogs. Why yes. Oh, look at the pose hitting the pose

4089
04:46:32,720 --> 04:46:35,440

4092
04:46:48,320 --> 04:46:53,360
For me personally, I'm not okay. I'm just having hallucination

4093
04:46:54,880 --> 04:46:56,880
The pose and the lean

4190
04:55:53,760 --> 04:55:55,760
You just have to be so close to the boss

4191
04:55:59,600 --> 04:56:01,600
Oh no, I won't pop up

4192
04:56:09,360 --> 04:56:11,360

Intermittent fasting. Yeah, I've basically been doing it by accident

4226
04:59:33,040 --> 04:59:35,040
I don't think he wants to attack us

4227
04:59:38,560 --> 04:59:40,560
I don't think he wants to transform

4228
04:59:43,120 --> 04:59:44,720
Okay

4229
04:59:44,720 --> 04:59:46,720

It doesn't have to be this way. I guess we're heading to romania

Once, okay. I'm

Sorry is the storehouse the map isn't so the map is there isn't here

What's the brazillian drama uh brazil's twitter has been banned. It's like any brazillian

Dreamer and stuff are getting it

05:03:08,660 --> 05:03:10,660
You need to go to mirth runes

And there's a cave and mirth runes. I don't know where that is

05:03:21,700 --> 05:03:24,200
Of course, I know where mirth runes are

4282
05:03:47,060 --> 05:03:48,900

05:04:37,140 --> 05:04:39,140
Oh, well, it's fucking excuse me then

4294
05:04:40,660 --> 05:04:43,140

a lot of clothes

4298
05:04:51,220 --> 05:04:53,220
If you're dragging your man

4299
05:04:55,300 --> 05:04:57,300
Nobody wants to be a piece of cheese

4300
05:04:58,580 --> 05:05:00,580
Oh, oh wait. No

4301
05:05:00,980 --> 05:05:02,980
dumbass

4302
05:05:02,980 --> 05:05:04,980
Not that

Sorry

4304
05:05:09,300 --> 05:05:14,660
It looks like you're saying sorry to me. Sorry, mommy. I don't need hunter you're new

4305
05:05:20,580 --> 05:05:22,820
Yeah, he's or a mat

He can you can drill with him with an emote. Mm using that me the best win a mot

4307
05:05:31,220 --> 05:05:36,580
How much time do we have seven hours we might finish today or really

4308
05:05:37,780 --> 05:05:41,700
Are you guys carrying me that hard? Thank you. I love you

4309
05:05:43,220 --> 05:05:44,820
But no, you're beautiful

4310
05:05:44,820 --> 05:05:50,260
Thank you for carrying me through the game because otherwise this game would be inaccessible to me and I'm really thankful

4311
05:05:50,580 --> 05:05:52,420
I know I keep saying thank you

4312
05:05:52,420 --> 05:05:58,340
But I mean it this game genuinely wouldn't be accessible to me if I didn't have you carrying me through it

4313
05:05:58,340 --> 05:06:04,100
And I'm really appreciative and I understand especially if you're really into the souls games that this is basically

4314
05:06:05,300 --> 05:06:07,300
A complete insult to the developer

4315
05:06:08,100 --> 05:06:09,140
Development team

4316
05:06:09,140 --> 05:06:15,140
But the truth of the matter is I couldn't play this game without you and it makes me happy that I get to experience it

4317
05:06:15,140 --> 05:06:16,500
and give off and

4318
05:06:16,500 --> 05:06:18,180
Muck about and

4319
05:06:18,180 --> 05:06:18,820
Cheer for you

4320
05:06:18,820 --> 05:06:22,820
Whilst you kill all the enemies for me because I don't know how to do it and I would never do it

4321
05:06:22,820 --> 05:06:26,900
And I'm like you need that. I love you and I thank you and I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I keep saying thank you

4322
05:06:26,900 --> 05:06:28,900
I mean it

4323
05:06:28,900 --> 05:06:30,900
The evil wormies look at them

4324
05:06:32,500 --> 05:06:33,780
You know

4325
05:06:33,780 --> 05:06:38,420
That I said it there. You're stuck with me. You're stuck with watching a bad gamer at work

4326
05:06:40,500 --> 05:06:42,020
Ooh

4327
05:06:42,020 --> 05:06:44,340
Oh, no, she's headless. She's a Dullahan

4328
05:06:45,620 --> 05:06:47,620
Dullahan for gen 2 confirmed

4329
05:06:50,740 --> 05:06:52,740
Elden ring wormy for gen 2 confirmed

4330
05:06:54,260 --> 05:06:56,260
Oh

4331
05:06:57,220 --> 05:06:59,220
I

4332
05:07:00,980 --> 05:07:06,180
Think those people also perished for the item without realizing those look creepy

4333
05:07:11,300 --> 05:07:13,300
I miss

4334
05:07:15,860 --> 05:07:22,340
Oh, wait, I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. Give me over here. Oh, something's hitting me with madness

4335
05:07:24,260 --> 05:07:26,260
Hold on. Let's get out of here. Let's go here

4336
05:07:27,860 --> 05:07:29,860
I'm getting charred by magna

4337
05:07:31,380 --> 05:07:35,380
A Dullahan chicken nugget. Could you imagine? No, how would you even?

4338
05:07:36,100 --> 05:07:40,340
I mean, it'd probably be the ultimate chicken nugget like oh, she doesn't have a head on her neck. Okay

4339
05:07:42,740 --> 05:07:46,100
Oh, no, I'm taking poison damage and oh can we go around?

4340
05:07:48,340 --> 05:07:50,340
Okay, I'm running I'm running

4341
05:07:50,740 --> 05:07:58,100
Did you get it didn't you know that was your reefing Vader?

4342
05:08:01,780 --> 05:08:03,780
Well, that did the madness

4343
05:08:04,980 --> 05:08:09,540
Surely the reefing invader wouldn't do such a thing to me. Not sure why I spoke

4344
05:08:10,340 --> 05:08:13,780
A quote would be as a feature me to be able to look at it, but if it doesn't like it

4345
05:08:15,220 --> 05:08:18,740
Hmm. I remember people being like, oh

4346
05:08:21,220 --> 05:08:23,220
Oh

4347
05:08:23,540 --> 05:08:29,220
The game shouldn't be the game should be played this way not this way and it's like so then why did they put spirit ashes in bro?

4348
05:08:30,420 --> 05:08:32,420
And they're like, no

4349
05:08:32,900 --> 05:08:38,420
No, my spirit ashes my spirit mimic. No, I wonder if I got a spirit mimic

4350
05:08:38,900 --> 05:08:44,020
If it would just do like 10 times better and then me like actually, I don't know. They're good stuff

4351
05:08:46,660 --> 05:08:48,420
Probably

4352
05:08:48,420 --> 05:08:50,420
You didn't beat the game

4353
05:08:54,020 --> 05:08:56,820
Doll hands and dolls are the least messed up chicken

4354
05:08:59,860 --> 05:09:06,500
Okay, and what do you feel about the kind of chicken nugget where you can take away the attachments for no particular reason at all

4355
05:09:07,060 --> 05:09:12,980
You could in theory take away the attachments of this chicken nugget and leave her bed in her bed as she wiggles about

4356
05:09:13,540 --> 05:09:19,860
How do we feel about that? Do we feel it is morally terrible or

4357
05:09:20,900 --> 05:09:24,180
What's the uh, how do we feel about that particular?

4358
05:09:26,180 --> 05:09:28,180
Asking for a friend

4359
05:09:30,180 --> 05:09:32,180
I feel intrigued. Okay

4360
05:09:32,180 --> 05:09:34,180
So

4361
05:09:41,380 --> 05:09:46,180
Dung ear and the dragon priestess are the only ashes that would take over me. Wait, you can summon in dung ear

4362
05:09:46,980 --> 05:09:48,980
If you kill him

4363
05:09:50,580 --> 05:09:56,420
Don't believe the nugget. I'm not sure how I feel about this. I wonder how you feel about it

4364
05:10:03,060 --> 05:10:04,180
I

4365
05:10:04,180 --> 05:10:08,820
Have a douser and sweet and sour sauce and take a bite. Oh, I mean, I guess if she

4366
05:10:09,860 --> 05:10:11,860
Oh, I am shine

4367
05:10:12,980 --> 05:10:14,980
neutralize and

4368
05:10:16,500 --> 05:10:22,500
There are so many words that I can never say wait, why are you thinking in? Oh, are we in trouble?

4369
05:10:25,060 --> 05:10:30,660
Is your footwork you're leaking again, but I was looking a second ago. How do you know?

4370
05:10:32,340 --> 05:10:35,700
Red flesh mushroom. Show me that mushroom tip

4371
05:10:44,740 --> 05:10:48,260
No, you have to jog him and give him body to creepy

4372
05:10:50,580 --> 05:10:52,580
Oh

4373
05:10:52,740 --> 05:10:54,740
It's one of them guys

4374
05:10:55,380 --> 05:10:58,660
How do you even find a tree to craft into an arrow that big?

4375
05:11:02,900 --> 05:11:04,900
Do you knock it off you

4376
05:11:05,700 --> 05:11:07,700
You stinker tin you're hurting my reflins

4377
05:11:08,980 --> 05:11:10,980
Is he aiming for me? No

4378
05:11:13,780 --> 05:11:18,900
The arrow was not even pointing there I get that they can't like accurately do the arrow

4379
05:11:19,060 --> 05:11:21,060
It was not there. Hold on to me

4380
05:11:21,700 --> 05:11:23,700
Get my endurance back second

4381
05:11:24,020 --> 05:11:26,020
Yeah, don't hurt my refunds mine

4382
05:11:27,380 --> 05:11:29,380
Golem's great arrow

4383
05:11:29,620 --> 05:11:32,420
Oh my gosh. Oh, yeah, just smithingstone as well

4384
05:11:33,620 --> 05:11:39,700
Did it make it easier to do smithingstone? Please don't die reflins. I really need you right now

4385
05:11:42,660 --> 05:11:48,180
Can we pretend like arrow flames in the night sky like shooting stars?

4386
05:11:49,300 --> 05:11:51,860
I could you really use all the strength now

4387
05:11:51,860 --> 05:11:53,860
I

4388
05:11:56,980 --> 05:12:01,940
The aim is super. Oh, we didn't get him. Sorry. I wasn't paying attention. Sorry

4389
05:12:03,460 --> 05:12:06,980
Sorry, I didn't really want to kill him. Jeez how much HP does this one have?

4390
05:12:09,220 --> 05:12:14,740
It excuse me most like that he got him. Whoa. No, they still got like 10%

4391
05:12:16,740 --> 05:12:18,820
Oh my gosh, why did he have so much?

4392
05:12:21,940 --> 05:12:23,940
A nice cheeky bit of HP

4393
05:12:25,540 --> 05:12:30,420
There's a lot of smithingstones in the DLC. They finally give like a farming option

4394
05:12:31,860 --> 05:12:36,020
I think they should yeah. Oh, hold on. Hold on. I need to get comfy in my chair

4395
05:12:36,740 --> 05:12:40,100
I need to make sure my foot is in a very specific location

4396
05:12:41,140 --> 05:12:44,020
It makes for the gaming experience very enjoyable

4397
05:12:44,660 --> 05:12:46,660
He

4398
05:12:48,260 --> 05:12:53,540
But I would never do anything like that. I don't know what you're thinking right now, but I've never

4399
05:12:54,260 --> 05:12:55,860
Where am I going?

4400
05:12:55,860 --> 05:12:57,860
You went a little bit

4401
05:13:01,780 --> 05:13:09,060
That's my secret I age every stream that wouldn't actually be entirely inaccurate

4402
05:13:09,860 --> 05:13:15,460
The rumble no my controller doesn't have a rumble

4403
05:13:16,660 --> 05:13:22,980
I take off the vibration on the controller because oh my gosh, right finally we can see what's in this part of the map

4404
05:13:23,220 --> 05:13:25,700
Okay, are we unlocked the whole map?

4405
05:13:27,460 --> 05:13:31,460
No, we didn't I I call BS. We have not unlocked the whole map

4406
05:13:32,820 --> 05:13:35,860
I call be it. I don't believe it for a second

4407
05:13:39,700 --> 05:13:45,540
I don't believe that this is the end of the the map for a second. Why are we crouching?

4408
05:13:46,260 --> 05:13:48,580
Yeah, we can be scared. Why are we crouching? Where are we going?

4409
05:13:51,860 --> 05:13:54,100
I've got blood on my butt. Can you see it?

4410
05:13:59,540 --> 05:14:01,540
Do you not trust them?

4411
05:14:02,180 --> 05:14:06,100
I do with my life. That's why I'm here because I trust you

4412
05:14:06,580 --> 05:14:12,020
Have you seen the Wiimo? What's that buzzin fan the Wiimo?

4413
05:14:26,260 --> 05:14:28,820
Okay, we're at a castle. It's pretty

4414
05:14:29,620 --> 05:14:30,820
We

4415
05:14:30,820 --> 05:14:37,380
Did you know you can buy all churches in Scotland for really cheap if you wanted to get a house in Scotland?

4416
05:14:37,940 --> 05:14:39,940
You can buy a church

4417
05:14:40,980 --> 05:14:44,100
Because churches are no longer really popular

4418
05:14:47,620 --> 05:14:50,260
They're crying but they're angry enough to attack us

4419
05:14:52,340 --> 05:14:54,340
Oh brother

4420
05:14:54,660 --> 05:14:56,660
This guy stinks

4421
05:14:57,220 --> 05:14:59,220
Ah

4422
05:14:59,300 --> 05:15:00,900
I saw it

4423
05:15:00,900 --> 05:15:02,900
Naughty go back to the shadow realm

4424
05:15:03,540 --> 05:15:10,500
You'll be safe there. Oh, no, that's a human. Sorry. Sorry. I didn't I didn't you weren't attacking me. I didn't mean to hurt you. I'm sorry

4425
05:15:13,140 --> 05:15:15,140
Jesus things good at dodging

4426
05:15:17,380 --> 05:15:20,180
I feel bad when I kill something that doesn't mean me any harm

4427
05:15:20,900 --> 05:15:22,900
I'm just so sorry

4428
05:15:22,980 --> 05:15:24,980
It was not my intention

4429
05:15:25,940 --> 05:15:27,940
I just have really bad aim

4430
05:15:29,940 --> 05:15:31,940
Okay

4431
05:15:37,860 --> 05:15:40,420
Wait, the nugget's gonna get a Nintendo remote. No

4432
05:15:44,820 --> 05:15:52,420
The leading to a talisman that fits my build. Oh, yeah 200 heavy. Mm-hmm. I'm totally not gonna do magic next time

4433
05:15:55,940 --> 05:15:59,140
Dear main that refling belongs to me not you

4434
05:16:06,340 --> 05:16:09,060
No, I can't break his stance. Thank you refling

4435
05:16:12,100 --> 05:16:14,420
Main whoa, you scared me

4436
05:16:16,980 --> 05:16:21,140
Okay talisman in here. Hello talisman. How's your wife and kids?

4437
05:16:22,100 --> 05:16:26,740
Oh, wait, I can double step. Do you mind I can double stack

4438
05:16:33,620 --> 05:16:38,180
Oh, you can double stack talismans. Who coded that in

4439
05:16:39,140 --> 05:16:43,700
Who thought about that? I can't believe it. They thought about stacking talisman abuse

4440
05:16:44,260 --> 05:16:46,740
Man game devs ruin all the fun

4441
05:16:47,540 --> 05:16:53,700
If I have two talisman, let me put on my two talisman. It doesn't matter where I put them on or what part of my body

4442
05:16:54,260 --> 05:16:56,260
Let me put them on

4443
05:16:57,300 --> 05:17:03,380
Now this game's targeted against me. How did you even have the first one? I refling gifted it to me

4444
05:17:06,580 --> 05:17:07,780
Oh

4445
05:17:07,780 --> 05:17:09,140
I

4446
05:17:09,140 --> 05:17:13,620
I was I may have been given like everything you see here

4447
05:17:14,340 --> 05:17:20,420
And uh, I may have sped around my stats even though I haven't done any of anything to earn it

4448
05:17:21,140 --> 05:17:24,260
Can I is this mine? Have I claimed this one before?

4449
05:17:26,660 --> 05:17:30,980
Is the enemy refling too close or am I going crazy? Did I claim this one?

4450
05:17:33,540 --> 05:17:40,500
It won't let me claim it. I think you need to go further away or is it already claimed? I don't know. I don't know

4451
05:17:44,580 --> 05:17:48,260
Wait, those are like new guys. We've not gone against those hold on. Let me claim this

Wow, they're so kind. Wait, why are you heartbroken? I get carried thinking

05:18:04,420 --> 05:18:08,340
You already got it. I don't remember those red guys

4457
05:18:08,740 --> 05:18:10,740

Okay, is everyone healed up? No, not yet. We're still healing almost there almost there so close

4465
05:18:59,540 --> 05:19:04,180
Oh, no, we'll never get the satisfaction of your health bar being filled

4466
05:19:06,660 --> 05:19:08,980
They're recolored by his lore so you can't hate

4467
05:19:11,540 --> 05:19:17,540
I mean they did add to the other guys the stone guy. Oh my gosh, there's so many of them

4468
05:19:18,740 --> 05:19:24,180
The master skywalker, what are we going to do? There's too many of them

4469
05:19:24,900 --> 05:19:26,900
Be yours

4470

Execute order

4471
05:19:33,140 --> 05:19:38,740
Anyway, that's my recreation of what happened in star wars. I've just saved you like so much time. Is that one real?

4472
05:19:38,820 --> 05:19:40,820
I knew that was real

4473
05:19:41,220 --> 05:19:43,220
I'm looking at them all sauce

4474
05:19:45,780 --> 05:19:47,780
Okay age the heal

Oh, oh my god, am I gonna look is it better than what I've got?

05:19:52,980 --> 05:19:54,980
Yes, or no

4477
05:19:55,140 --> 05:19:57,860
No, that one another one. There should be something new

4478
05:19:59,460 --> 05:20:04,900
Hold on. I'm getting shocked. Oh, I said no more bird girl for gen three. Fuck you

4479
05:20:09,780 --> 05:20:11,780
No

4480
05:20:14,020 --> 05:20:21,140
No, there's no talisman double stacking. I promise sir. Oh, no, but I mean you can go ahead and uh inspect away

4481
05:20:21,140 --> 05:20:23,140
Please be my guest

4482
05:20:23,220 --> 05:20:25,220
Thank you anon

4483
05:20:25,220 --> 05:20:28,820
I've always wanted to write a rule play like that because I feel like it's so silly

4484
05:20:28,900 --> 05:20:30,900
But it's like my perfect kind of silliness

4485
05:20:31,540 --> 05:20:35,540
Like, oh no, what do you mean? You have to do a cavity search

4486
05:20:39,540 --> 05:20:43,540
And then it's like okay after like 20 seconds it's like, okay, that's it done

4487
05:20:43,540 --> 05:20:49,620
We're satisfied with our results and I'm just like no, no, no, no, no you need to check do two fingers this

4488
05:20:52,100 --> 05:20:55,060
I was like, no, no, you need to make sure you're doing your job properly

4489
05:20:55,700 --> 05:20:58,660
Whoa, those things are getting me. Ow

4490
05:21:00,180 --> 05:21:02,180
I'm not gonna eat out

4491
05:21:02,180 --> 05:21:04,180
Okay, I think we're at a range

4492
05:21:06,100 --> 05:21:10,340
The rubber gob snap and everything oh no reflin inspector

4493
05:21:11,300 --> 05:21:13,300
Oh, I missed

4494
05:21:14,820 --> 05:21:16,820

05:21:16,980 --> 05:21:18,980
Uh, what is it called?

4496
05:21:19,460 --> 05:21:20,740
Whoa

4497
05:21:20,740 --> 05:21:22,260
Holy

4498
05:21:22,260 --> 05:21:27,460
I'm just trying to enjoy the environment. Okay. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I can't do anything. Holy holy moly

4499
05:21:28,340 --> 05:21:32,180
What was that ash of war? I couldn't even read it. I was too busy getting killed by a shrimp

4500
05:21:34,340 --> 05:21:37,460
Oh my god, a shrimp vtuber. What a crazy concept

4501
05:21:39,940 --> 05:21:42,740
I wonder if I'm going to love a shrimp vtuber in the future

4502
05:21:43,140 --> 05:21:45,140
Oh

4503
05:21:48,660 --> 05:21:50,660
He's gonna cause me blood loss

4504
05:21:52,340 --> 05:21:54,340
Oh, okay

4505
05:21:59,940 --> 05:22:01,940
I can't reach him

4506
05:22:02,740 --> 05:22:04,740
Oh, okay. He'll time he'll time

4507
05:22:05,460 --> 05:22:09,380
Everyone group together more here shrimp. Oh posture check. How do you

4508
05:22:10,020 --> 05:22:14,340
Fuck you hydration checks you more like roaches with lots of human hand

4509
05:22:18,820 --> 05:22:22,340
Is she fucking with us or leaking gen two I've leaked so much of gen two

4510
05:22:24,020 --> 05:22:26,500
I've told you that we're not having certain

4511
05:22:27,220 --> 05:22:28,420
characters

4512
05:22:28,420 --> 05:22:30,420
and we are and

4513
05:22:30,420 --> 05:22:35,140
I've told you that we're not having this and we are and I've told you we're definitely having this but we aren't

4514
05:22:36,100 --> 05:22:38,900
Uh, it's just kind of fun now just to say anything

4515
05:22:39,380 --> 05:22:45,940
Because when it does get revealed, I get to go remember that time I said this. Do you remember that time I said this?

4516

4692
05:36:05,620 --> 05:36:11,140
Someone accused me of not knowing them another day and she took that personally. Isn't that like a massive meme song?

4693
05:36:12,260 --> 05:36:14,900

I deserved that hold on if he's looking at okay, there we go. Oh reefland almost got you there

4741
05:40:48,020 --> 05:40:52,500
Danger danger when I started swinging the sword. I don't know who's gonna get hit. Okay

4742
05:40:54,580 --> 05:40:57,060
Very unnoticed we need to see them truly

Push it under. Oh, I hear them

Oh, I can't reach that. There's like a wizard up there

05:41:10,740 --> 05:41:14,820
You're a wizard diary that we've fun. Okay. It's getting his ass kicked

4747

I believe I'm alone. He works very hard for me. Okay

4748
05:41:25,940 --> 05:41:28,500
Oh, there's a re-stair case here if you guys want to get on that

05:41:42,420 --> 05:41:44,920
Down question mark

4751
05:41:48,260 --> 05:41:51,860
Okay, we need to wait for that other reefland to get back here

4752
05:41:57,060 --> 05:42:02,660
There's a wall here that can fall through and it's an instacle reef laying. Are you okay?

4753
05:42:06,660 --> 05:42:08,660
The others they're coming

4754
05:42:09,620 --> 05:42:11,620
Oh

4755
05:42:18,500 --> 05:42:20,500
Wait, did he die

4756
05:42:20,900 --> 05:42:25,060
Can I not beat the fuck out of this stupid statue and kill these fucking things?

4757
05:42:26,340 --> 05:42:28,740
Oh, right. Okay. Do we have to go on?

4758
05:42:30,820 --> 05:42:35,220
We must go on without the reef link. Did he die or am I going mental and he didn't die

4759
05:42:36,180 --> 05:42:42,980
Wait, no, he's killing stuff. He's coming. Am I to follow you?

4760
05:42:50,580 --> 05:42:52,580
Am I to follow the enemy reefland?

4761
05:42:53,860 --> 05:42:57,540
I'm following you. What was this? I'm supposed to follow or am I being really dumb?

4762
05:42:58,500 --> 05:43:02,740
Well, he says go down so I'm going down. Oh, sorry. Sorry. I didn't mean that. Sorry

4763
05:43:03,700 --> 05:43:06,820
I'm a bit heavier on my feet than I originally expected. Sorry

4764
05:43:10,420 --> 05:43:12,660
The eyes are so creepy bug eyes

4765
05:43:16,500 --> 05:43:21,940
That's an edible ear seems like they would use a plastic as far this way

4766
05:43:24,900 --> 05:43:29,220
I can hear those ears add those eyes with my ears

4767
05:43:29,220 --> 05:43:31,220
Be a weebam

4768
05:43:34,340 --> 05:43:36,340

Yeah, two of us can swing our freaking big swords around

4771
05:43:45,780 --> 05:43:47,780
Another yin

4772
05:43:50,980 --> 05:43:52,980
How do you know where you're going?

4773
05:43:54,980 --> 05:43:56,980
This all looks the same

4774
05:44:00,100 --> 05:44:02,340
Wait, so then where's the other reef link?

4775
05:44:06,500 --> 05:44:13,940
Huh, we're still reefing list. Hold on. I need my weeb. Is he chilling?

4776
05:44:19,780 --> 05:44:26,740
How have we lost you so badly? Reef link? Are you here?

05:44:29,540 --> 05:44:33,540
Reef them, baby. I've lost my child

4782
05:44:56,420 --> 05:44:59,540
Where are you reef link and you're still alive

05:46:37,460 --> 05:46:39,460
But he's not at the boss anymore. He's with us

4799
05:46:40,260 --> 05:46:43,140
I never have lost the one that was started exploring with us

4800
05:46:43,460 --> 05:46:48,740
This is worse than a mother in a supermarket. I don't know how we've managed that

4801
05:46:52,020 --> 05:47:01,460
This is impossible. Are you are you there? He's not there. Oh, I'm gonna die. Sorry. I'm gonna die because I'm an idiot

Uh one moment. Yeah, you just dropped me an item. I saw it in the corner. See you just needed an instant

You can't see it because I'm covering it up this refling gifted me one bar of soap in game

4810

No, you're in trouble. You're actually it

4816
05:48:17,620 --> 05:48:20,120
Okay, you can redeem yourself if you kill this boss in one

4817
05:48:30,580 --> 05:48:32,580
Oh

4818
05:48:42,100 --> 05:48:44,100
Is it free hits on me?

4819
05:48:53,140 --> 05:48:55,140
Oh don't mind if I do

4820
05:49:01,220 --> 05:49:04,740
I think that was friendly

4821
05:49:09,220 --> 05:49:11,220
On no way

4822
05:49:13,940 --> 05:49:15,940
So we can break his poise at least

4823
05:49:24,180 --> 05:49:27,060
Yeah, he gets staggered rather easily and compares

4824
05:49:27,940 --> 05:49:32,340
What these looks like disco. Oh, sorry. I just broke them out of that. I think that was a crit there

4825
05:49:33,540 --> 05:49:35,780
May just bolt that one off a little bit. Sorry

4826
05:49:37,300 --> 05:49:39,300
I'm out of stamina

4827
05:49:39,380 --> 05:49:41,380
I'm out of stamina

4828
05:49:48,580 --> 05:49:50,580
Whoa

4829
05:49:51,060 --> 05:49:53,060

We did it. Oh my god take that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's right

If you love me, you won't leave

4832
05:50:11,060 --> 05:50:13,140
If you love me, you won't disappear

4833
05:50:13,140 --> 05:50:15,140
Shambles. I'm in shambles. Truly

4834
05:50:15,860 --> 05:50:18,740
I'm in shambles. Please. Please come back

4835
05:50:20,740 --> 05:50:22,740
It's so dark inside me

4836
05:50:26,900 --> 05:50:32,260
The lost kids at the supermarket. I mean, they honestly did pretty damn good at today. Oh, it's a face

4837
05:50:37,540 --> 05:50:39,220

05:50:39,220 --> 05:50:40,740
kind of feels

4839
05:50:40,740 --> 05:50:44,340
Rather alive with the blood coming out of it. That must be Godwin

Your daddy chicken get taken away because he wasn't allowed to meet with mommy chicken

4859
05:51:55,540 --> 05:51:59,620
Or did you discover what happens to boy chickens at farms and that made you an evil chicken?

4860
05:52:00,260 --> 05:52:02,260
You don't want to know what happens to boy chickens at a farm

4861
05:52:02,660 --> 05:52:04,660
He

05:52:07,460 --> 05:52:09,460

4880
05:53:22,340 --> 05:53:23,540

4881
05:53:23,540 --> 05:53:25,540
Ravine north

4882
05:53:26,500 --> 05:53:28,500

05:53:51,140 --> 05:53:53,140
This is called the simp bill

4890
05:53:53,300 --> 05:53:55,300
Everything is good for five euros

4891
05:53:55,300 --> 05:53:57,860
I don't refunds let me play the game because without the refunds

4892
05:53:57,860 --> 05:54:01,620
I wouldn't be able to play this game would be kind of blocked off from me in all honesty

4893
05:54:02,180 --> 05:54:04,180
So I get loads of help

4894
05:54:04,180 --> 05:54:09,380
I have to go now. Have a good night rest well sleepyhead and rest well to anyone who needs to go get some

4895
05:54:10,100 --> 05:54:12,100
Uh stuff and things

4896
05:54:12,580 --> 05:54:14,580

4897
05:54:14,820 --> 05:54:16,820
To do unable to summon

4898
05:54:17,460 --> 05:54:19,460
Oh no, are we having a glitch?

4899
05:54:22,340 --> 05:54:28,500
Mass think 16 18. Thank you for the 50 gifted membership. What the heck? You didn't have to do that. Thank you

4900
05:54:28,660 --> 05:54:33,300
Congrats to those. Oh, I've never checked if I have a new emoteslot. Hold on. We can do that live

4901
05:54:34,740 --> 05:54:36,180
I might have a new emoteslot

4902
05:54:36,180 --> 05:54:41,940
I did not expect all those freaking gifted memberships at the end of my my fake asmr stream

4903
05:54:42,900 --> 05:54:44,900
That was insane honestly

4904
05:54:46,660 --> 05:54:48,660
What does it say?

4905
05:54:48,980 --> 05:54:55,860
Emojis obviously it's not going to register that holy crap. It asks for a lot of freaking gifted memberships. Are you serious?

4906
05:54:55,860 --> 05:54:57,860
That's a big number

4907
05:54:57,940 --> 05:55:02,580
Matt, what the did you mean? Do you need a refund? That's twice you put that through

4908
05:55:04,980 --> 05:55:07,620
Did you mean that was that a mistake?

4909
05:55:07,620 --> 05:55:09,620
Oh

4910
05:55:11,060 --> 05:55:13,060
Was that a mistake?

4911
05:55:13,860 --> 05:55:18,900
Thank you. No, that's correct. What the fuck. Thank you for a hundred gifted memberships

4912
05:55:20,500 --> 05:55:22,500

4913
05:55:22,980 --> 05:55:25,700
Congrats to everyone who caught them with your face

4914
05:55:27,060 --> 05:55:31,140
Maths is good at maths. Obviously. Yeah, you better have all your bills repaid

4915
05:55:31,940 --> 05:55:36,740
You're got no debt to your name. You've been treating yourself with takeaway and steak

4916
05:55:38,020 --> 05:55:42,820
You've been looking after yourself. Thank you. Oh my gosh

4917
05:55:45,380 --> 05:55:47,860
Gigas had a refund. I nailed to the math

4918
05:55:49,300 --> 05:55:54,740
Congrats everyone get in a membership as well. Oh my god

4919
05:55:56,900 --> 05:56:05,700

4920
05:56:06,020 --> 05:56:08,020
Thank you. No more

4921
05:56:09,620 --> 05:56:18,020
Thank you so much math for the 150 gifted memberships put the card down. No more. I'm sure I'm sure I'm I'm satisfied

4922
05:56:18,100 --> 05:56:21,460
I'm done. I'm happy. Okay. No more

4923
05:56:22,180 --> 05:56:25,220
No more. We're good. Oh, you've broken my controller apparently

4924
05:56:26,420 --> 05:56:28,420
I don't know how that happened

4925
05:56:28,500 --> 05:56:30,740
Oh, you got you on your knees for me

4926
05:56:31,540 --> 05:56:33,060
Oh

4927
05:56:33,060 --> 05:56:35,540
Wow, bounty hunter. It does not like you

4928
05:56:36,580 --> 05:56:42,020
Math, thank you. My birthday was a few days ago. Can I get switch? Happy birthday, guru. Hit lurking in the doorbell

4929
05:56:42,820 --> 05:56:46,020
Okay, happy birthday, Bob. Thank you for the tip

4930
05:56:47,860 --> 05:56:51,060
Maths decided to rapid-fire gifted subs. Holy moly

4931
05:56:51,940 --> 05:56:53,940
Holy moly

4932
05:56:54,420 --> 05:57:01,060
Uh, I think it's broken. I don't know why it only shows bounty hunter. Is anyone else trying to stream snipe here?

4933
05:57:01,140 --> 05:57:03,140
Or are we stuck at the riverine?

4934
05:57:04,980 --> 05:57:10,260
The simple fact is I can't contribute directly to the donor funds. I'm giving an early birthday gift. Oh, well

4935
05:57:10,340 --> 05:57:14,180
That's certainly fucking counts as a gift. I assure you I've been gifted enough you can

4936
05:57:15,060 --> 05:57:19,380
You can no more gifts because uh, that's that's that's good

4937
05:57:20,580 --> 05:57:23,540
That's good. That's that's enough slices

4938
05:57:24,900 --> 05:57:32,740
That's enough slices. I don't I think this is broken. It only shows bounty hunter. Oh, it's it. I was trying now

4939
05:57:34,820 --> 05:57:38,180
150 gifts is the membership only literally only

4940
05:57:39,460 --> 05:57:43,540
Thank you, math. That was very kind. The other really things we'll have to carry you through the donor song

4941
05:57:43,940 --> 05:57:49,940
I assure you, uh, the goal of 69 dollars for generation to production

4942
05:57:50,820 --> 05:57:56,020
Begins, uh, I believe it's obtainable controversial. I believe it's holy

4943
05:57:56,740 --> 05:57:58,900
Mummy's chat is filled with people coming members

4944
05:57:59,540 --> 05:58:05,860
They didn't got enough emotes slots or three literally should we give her better fashion? No, no, don't give me the drip

4945
05:58:05,940 --> 05:58:07,940
I like my wee armoury

4946
05:58:08,900 --> 05:58:10,900
Um

4947
05:58:11,140 --> 05:58:13,700
Was it it's a bounty hunter did man should I don't have?

4948
05:58:13,940 --> 05:58:15,940
I

4949
05:58:16,660 --> 05:58:22,900
Still processing all the gifted memberships. Look, can you see it as well? You see it the way it displays for me

4950
05:58:23,860 --> 05:58:27,940
It's like process. It's like having to process who is assigning to

4951
05:58:28,740 --> 05:58:31,940
It's still going. It's still processing

4952
05:58:32,900 --> 05:58:39,300
Okay, it's what yeah, I was gonna say I would respect your request not continue. Thank you. Yes, please make sure you're spoiling yourself

4953
05:58:39,300 --> 05:58:45,940
I assure you you've spoiled me and other reeflings more than enough because everyone gets the wee emotes now

4954
05:58:46,900 --> 05:58:48,900
Thank you. That was very kind

4955
05:58:49,140 --> 05:58:50,340
Um

4956
05:58:50,340 --> 05:58:56,020
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go out on a limb and say yeah once that registers. We're probably got another emotes slot unlocked. Yeah

4957
05:58:59,540 --> 05:59:05,460
Anyone who ever watched mummy is now officially a member. I wonder if you get notified like even if you're not live and watching

4958
05:59:05,860 --> 05:59:07,860
Whoa

4959
05:59:07,940 --> 05:59:11,380
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're under attack. I don't mean to alarm you

4960
05:59:13,060 --> 05:59:18,900
There's a bear. There's a dadda. There's a dadda repeat. There's a freaking dadda

4961
05:59:20,660 --> 05:59:22,820
Do we need to I don't want to hurt them

4962
05:59:23,860 --> 05:59:26,020
Okay, is it okay? Okay

4963
05:59:27,940 --> 05:59:32,420
I'm out of stamina. I'm out of stamina you get an email. Okay, so

4964
05:59:34,260 --> 05:59:37,380
I walked away for a minute with the fuck there's like six billions. I literally

4965
05:59:38,740 --> 05:59:41,220
Are you whipping us in vaderling?

4966
05:59:42,820 --> 05:59:47,460
It's a rogue dadda. He's not had enough of ice to getting steaming on our dj extreme

4967
05:59:50,660 --> 05:59:53,220
Okay, we're good. We're good. We're safe

4968
05:59:56,660 --> 06:00:01,780
You do get a notification. It's happened to me a couple of times. Okay. Thank you. Thank you to the icons in

4969
06:00:02,740 --> 06:00:04,740
It's an email. Good night, man

4970
06:00:06,820 --> 06:00:09,460
Mummy the snowberries have brain worms again. Oh, no, why?

4971
06:00:11,700 --> 06:00:13,700
And she don't just do that

4972
06:00:14,420 --> 06:00:16,420
dj stream

4973
06:00:17,380 --> 06:00:24,740
Something's coming. I hear it. Something's approaching me. You know what? You know what? Yeah, think twice

4974
06:00:28,100 --> 06:00:30,100
I saw the notification

4975
06:00:30,980 --> 06:00:36,180
Congrats and catching a gifted sub with your faith. Oh, no membership is not sub

4976
06:00:37,060 --> 06:00:38,740
Do I smell bacon?

4977
06:00:38,740 --> 06:00:43,940
Change the drip now. There are over a hundred armor sets in Eldering and you made a travesty. This is a full set

4978
06:00:44,020 --> 06:00:48,980
What are you on about a travesty? This is a full set. This is this is how it was supposed to be worn

4979
06:00:49,780 --> 06:00:51,940
No train. I guess like I was with no mummy

4980
06:00:52,820 --> 06:00:54,580
Well almost said the word

4981
06:00:54,580 --> 06:00:59,700
I almost said the word that I'm not supposed to see because you're not allowed to see yet

4982
06:00:59,780 --> 06:01:01,780
Because it's a bad word

4983
06:01:03,300 --> 06:01:06,980
I sense a fight up ahead and it looks like that's him over there

4984
06:01:08,980 --> 06:01:14,020
Okay, can't wait to watch the final two bosses. I don't have no idea how close I'm getting to the end

4985
06:01:15,300 --> 06:01:17,140
I thought they said the

4986
06:01:17,140 --> 06:01:19,140
Okay, let's do this

4987
06:01:19,860 --> 06:01:21,860
This is the boss

4988
06:01:21,860 --> 06:01:26,740
Please stop locking onto the refling. No lock onto the wait. That's not the boss. No it is

4989
06:01:27,540 --> 06:01:29,540
But it will not stop

4990
06:01:31,140 --> 06:01:33,140
I'm already out of stamina

4991
06:01:33,620 --> 06:01:35,620
It is dad has gone rogue

4992
06:01:40,260 --> 06:01:42,260
I can't believe it

4993
06:01:46,980 --> 06:01:48,980
Oh

4994
06:01:49,540 --> 06:01:51,540
Wait, why

4995
06:01:52,100 --> 06:01:56,260
I think I have a blessing on I think my health went up a little bit there. I must do

4996
06:01:57,460 --> 06:01:59,460
I don't know how that hurt me, but sure

4997
06:02:00,260 --> 06:02:02,260
Oh, you let him on fire

4998
06:02:02,660 --> 06:02:04,660

We seem to be unwelcome here Black Ops 6 beta is free. I thought it ended

5015
06:03:37,060 --> 06:03:39,380
I thought the beta closed

5016
06:03:41,540 --> 06:03:45,060
Where am I heading? Where are we going?

5017
06:03:47,140 --> 06:03:52,660

Near the map

06:03:57,700 --> 06:04:00,900
Yeah, I was gonna play it with you, but it ended too soon

5020
06:04:01,780 --> 06:04:05,780
I think I'm done in this area right where we're going. Oh god, my PC's taking off. Please don't

5021
06:04:08,020 --> 06:04:11,780

It's adorable. What's behind it? Is it buried? Can you guys come through?

5159
06:21:11,620 --> 06:21:13,620
I open it on this side

5160
06:21:14,420 --> 06:21:15,620
Huh

5161
06:21:15,620 --> 06:21:17,620
I can't open it. Okay. Well, that's fine

5162
06:21:19,140 --> 06:21:21,140
Our is good

5163
06:21:22,020 --> 06:21:26,980
You take the small baby door for my little baby hand. Okay. I guess we just go straight ahead

5164
06:21:28,260 --> 06:21:31,140
The bridges in this game always make me nervous

5165
06:21:31,700 --> 06:21:36,180
Always don't I don't trust the bridges. What are you casting someone's casting?

5166
06:21:38,900 --> 06:21:41,300
You know the worst part some pimples want to pair another

5167
06:21:41,860 --> 06:21:45,460
A hundred to take it from the trash and return it to the freezer

5168
06:21:45,860 --> 06:21:51,380
Well, I said to I was like, why not paint it like a tank capsule and paint like put the date on it and draw the

5169
06:21:51,780 --> 06:21:56,420
Pin pal on it like in paint and then put it back in the freezer and see what it's like

5170
06:21:57,780 --> 06:22:01,860
Like in a year's time to see how it looks and all of that just the shits and giggles

5171
06:22:01,940 --> 06:22:06,580
But she was like I've traumatized the pin pals enough of that freezer. I'm like a hot blouse though

5172
06:22:07,620 --> 06:22:09,620
This is a bad bridge

5173
06:22:11,300 --> 06:22:13,300
What even

5174
06:22:13,300 --> 06:22:16,180
It's like spewing fire as

5175
06:22:19,300 --> 06:22:22,260
Bridges are totally safe not for streamers

5176
06:22:26,740 --> 06:22:31,700
It's like spraying on you reflins. I'm so sorry. Is that because of her?

5177
06:22:33,060 --> 06:22:36,900
Is she the one that's spraying on you only I'm allowed to score it on you. What the fuck?

5178
06:22:37,780 --> 06:22:39,780
Knock it off

5179
06:22:40,180 --> 06:22:49,220
Whoa, I'm out of the thingy. Oh, I miss. Okay, there we go. Was that all because of her?

5180
06:22:51,300 --> 06:22:53,700
I heard oh rain of fire it was

5181
06:22:56,900 --> 06:23:00,900
Is that a PewDiePie reference right here? I don't know it might be

5182
06:23:04,340 --> 06:23:09,140
New drip for you should it it's not gonna be stronger than what like literally. Oh, yeah

5183
06:23:09,140 --> 06:23:12,980
You like that you like that you can't that is awful. What even get off

5184
06:23:14,100 --> 06:23:16,100
Get off. I'm upset

5185
06:23:16,340 --> 06:23:24,980
Behold go no further go no further. I will I will go further come come enemy refling you you're wanted even if you're bad

Okay, I touch

The furnace golem here is extreme her is extreme here is extremely simple

5191
06:23:49,060 --> 06:23:51,460
Whoa ancient ruins of raw

5192
06:23:53,700 --> 06:24:02,580
Whoa, I like the dlc is very purdy and compares like there actually appears to be life in the dlc

5193
06:24:02,580 --> 06:24:07,860
Whereas like in the base game is like there's no life. It just can't exist

5194
06:24:09,460 --> 06:24:14,660
Um, wait, you need the horse to advance later. How is she gonna manage? Oh, no

5195
06:24:18,500 --> 06:24:20,500
Brian

5196
06:24:26,740 --> 06:24:29,620
Yes, they did thank you typical nation, um

5197
06:24:30,500 --> 06:24:35,140
We're doing more bosses on the dlc. I'm not entirely sure where we're going

5198
06:24:35,140 --> 06:24:41,700
They're literally it's like I I have my my caller and my leash on right now. They just take me where I need to go

5199
06:24:41,700 --> 06:24:43,700
I'm just here for a good time

5200
06:24:44,020 --> 06:24:46,660
Hey, okay, I guess we're going on a platform

5201
06:24:48,180 --> 06:24:51,700
This goodness is so hard. We just have to kill golem for I'm getting nervous

5202
06:24:52,100 --> 06:24:57,140
Who is this golem we speak of because it doesn't sound like the golem. I know that that's not golem

5203
06:25:00,100 --> 06:25:03,060
Oh critical wait, we both got critical

5204
06:25:03,620 --> 06:25:05,620
Is that a load

5205
06:25:07,140 --> 06:25:10,820
Is a double critical a load or is that because of lag we got away with that

5206
06:25:14,020 --> 06:25:16,020
Is that because okay

5207
06:25:18,180 --> 06:25:19,940
You damn

06:25:19,940 --> 06:25:21,940

Rather fruit. Thank you for your offering. You are forgiven. I give you head pat pat pat pat

5210
06:25:28,100 --> 06:25:31,140
You're forgiven for being an evil wrestling deep down inside

5211
06:25:31,940 --> 06:25:35,940
But you can be what is that noise? There's like a noise out here. Is it you? No

5212
06:25:37,220 --> 06:25:38,500
Hey

5213
06:25:38,500 --> 06:25:41,940
I can hear like scratching in my ears. I'm going to get sprain it

5214
06:25:43,940 --> 06:25:47,380
It's the literal brain worms are getting to me. Oh my god. I can't believe it

5215
06:25:54,420 --> 06:25:56,420
Are we gonna be okay

5216
06:25:56,420 --> 06:25:59,220
Is there like a safe station a grease site? Sorry

5217
06:26:00,100 --> 06:26:02,100
Okay, okay, we're going for it

5218
06:26:02,580 --> 06:26:05,540
All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right

5219
06:26:06,660 --> 06:26:08,900
I don't lose all my stamina walking up to him

5220
06:26:11,140 --> 06:26:14,260
Okay, I did a whole two damage there

5221
06:26:16,900 --> 06:26:18,900
Oh my gosh

5222
06:26:19,780 --> 06:26:23,140
Oh, he's got him. Can you do the ultimate?

5223
06:26:24,900 --> 06:26:26,900
You did it

5224
06:26:26,900 --> 06:26:28,660
Beat him up

5225
06:26:28,660 --> 06:26:30,660
Enemy fell. Oh, yeah

5226
06:26:31,140 --> 06:26:34,900
Beat him up. Beat him up. Beat him up. Beat him up. Oh, I got a secretary

5227
06:26:35,540 --> 06:26:38,740
Oh, no, how did you even change your look so quickly?

5228
06:26:39,540 --> 06:26:42,580
You're in game with me. Oh wait. Are you gonna disappear?

5229
06:26:43,700 --> 06:26:45,700
No, you're not gonna disappear. I didn't count

5230
06:26:47,380 --> 06:26:49,540
15 hours of sleep is good until you sleep that long

5231
06:26:51,300 --> 06:26:52,180
Uh

5232
06:26:52,180 --> 06:26:56,660
What how many technicals would I suck for 15 hours of sleep?

5233
06:26:56,740 --> 06:26:58,740
I would satisfy so many technicals

5234
06:27:00,820 --> 06:27:02,500
That I would

5235
06:27:02,500 --> 06:27:05,060
15 hours of peace slumber

5236
06:27:05,620 --> 06:27:07,620
There's an enemy reefing coming

5237
06:27:08,020 --> 06:27:09,460
Is he lost?

5238
06:27:09,460 --> 06:27:11,460
Wait, did the enemy reefing despawn?

5239
06:27:14,180 --> 06:27:16,180
I can hear the others

5240
06:27:20,260 --> 06:27:22,260
I'm gonna go back up

5241
06:27:22,820 --> 06:27:27,060
Wait fire here comes

5242
06:27:31,540 --> 06:27:33,540
That's scary

5243
06:27:34,580 --> 06:27:38,580
Sleeping that long is bad for you. I remember when I told my doctor

5244
06:27:39,860 --> 06:27:42,340
So this is when I was in the process of getting a blood test

5245
06:27:42,900 --> 06:27:46,500
uh, just in general to see what my like health is like

5246
06:27:48,100 --> 06:27:50,100
and

5247
06:27:50,180 --> 06:27:52,680
When I got the blood results back, I was like, oh

5248
06:27:53,460 --> 06:27:57,540
Is that why I sleep like 12 hours in the look on her face?

5249
06:27:57,940 --> 06:28:01,620
She was like strawney i'ma hold your hand when I say this you dumbass

5250
06:28:02,020 --> 06:28:06,420
I was like, oh, can you afford it? Obviously my doctor didn't say that but um

5251
06:28:08,980 --> 06:28:14,820
She I was just like, oh is that why I can sleep for a really long time and still feel tired and she's like strawney

5252
06:28:14,820 --> 06:28:18,820
You're literally about to be anemic rub get some iron in you

5253
06:28:20,580 --> 06:28:22,580
um

5254
06:28:22,900 --> 06:28:25,700
She said it with her eyes. Literally the look was like you

5255
06:28:28,340 --> 06:28:31,060
Um wait 12 hours is normal for pretty girls though

5256
06:28:31,940 --> 06:28:36,740
Yes, uh, it is definitely a feminine trait. You need more iron

5257
06:28:37,860 --> 06:28:40,820
If you sleep and you're still tired a lot embers

5258
06:28:41,460 --> 06:28:46,100
I'm sending you a little pill bottle of iron supplements unironically

5259
06:28:47,060 --> 06:28:50,180
And she was like basically all

5260
06:28:50,900 --> 06:28:57,220
It's like so common to be iron decision and I was like, oh, I don't even like eating red meat that much

5261
06:28:58,820 --> 06:29:02,260
Um, like I have a steak and a wee fried egg

5262
06:29:04,500 --> 06:29:09,060
Guys you heard mommy she needs iron again. Oh, we never wrote that script. Oh my god

5263
06:29:09,700 --> 06:29:12,500
I was checking. Oh my god. Sorry. I need help to scream fun. Oh

5264
06:29:13,300 --> 06:29:15,300

06:29:16,420 --> 06:29:18,420
It looks like in november

5266
06:29:19,300 --> 06:29:20,500
is when

5267
06:29:20,500 --> 06:29:21,620
My

5268
06:29:21,620 --> 06:29:27,860
Scripts start running a little bit dry, which means we can write more stuff together, which I'm really excited about

5269
06:29:28,500 --> 06:29:34,660
Um, like I know most creators feel. Oh my god. My scripts are running dry. I'm not prepared after november at me

5270
06:29:35,060 --> 06:29:37,140
Fuck yeah, I get to make more plots together with you

5271
06:29:38,180 --> 06:29:40,180
Fuck yeah, I can't read

5272
06:29:41,860 --> 06:29:43,860
Here

5273
06:29:44,420 --> 06:29:46,420
I mean they're gonna kill them

5274
06:29:48,580 --> 06:29:50,580
I need some iron pills for but

5275
06:29:50,820 --> 06:29:53,860
Gonna head to bed. Good night. Rest well. Thank you for hanging

5276
06:29:55,620 --> 06:29:59,220
Oh, I'm back on the runway. Hello. Sorry, I got the wrong way

5277
06:30:01,540 --> 06:30:04,660
Uh, those 12 scripts from another life are all wholesome though

06:30:06,900 --> 06:30:09,300
Uh, they're all like I hear

5279
06:30:10,260 --> 06:30:14,260
Is it a fire crackling in here? Oh, I'm to open the door. Sorry. Sorry

06:30:15,060 --> 06:30:20,180
Open system. Okay. I'm gonna check if my tea's ready to be drank or if it's still piping hot

5281
06:30:22,180 --> 06:30:23,060
It's all wholesome stuff

5282
06:30:23,060 --> 06:30:28,580
I was gonna recreate the foot one. Um, because I never recorded it under my usual recording

5283
06:30:29,620 --> 06:30:33,380
Oh my gosh, we got a Molotov cocktail going on

5284
06:30:33,540 --> 06:30:39,700
Dang um, save some souls for the rest of us. Please don't know

Actually, I need to start asking what kind of youtube milestone stuff you would like to hear not yet

5296
06:31:31,620 --> 06:31:34,900
I'm not ready for it yet, but soon I will be ready

5297

And once the manager for audios is in place and then the general manager is in place, uh

Back on the wrong way

Am I not to go that way?

5306
06:32:11,940 --> 06:32:14,340
I'm a bit scared. Maybe I shouldn't have done that

5307
06:32:15,700 --> 06:32:18,420
I'm not sure. I'm not sure if I should have done that

5308
06:32:22,900 --> 06:32:24,900

06:33:21,540 --> 06:33:26,660
My microphone actually keeps saying I'm peeking just talking into I don't know if I need to turn my microphone down

5320
06:33:27,700 --> 06:33:35,060
We things get a nibble. Yeah, you're in a nibble on my yicking. Oh, I got a fragment. I got the fragments

5321
06:33:36,180 --> 06:33:38,180
No, it's good

5322
06:33:38,340 --> 06:33:43,780
If you want to have us here, you need to make the game lower sounds fine. Your volume's good. You aren't peeking

5323
06:33:44,820 --> 06:33:48,580
Don't get one guide. No, no, I literally is going red every time I talk

5324
06:33:50,500 --> 06:33:53,060
Uh, it's like you're you're so red

5325
06:33:54,660 --> 06:33:56,660
You're beautiful

5326
06:33:58,420 --> 06:34:00,900
I've seen you're peeking because you have peak call. Oh, yeah

5327
06:34:03,300 --> 06:34:06,820
You're gonna make me blush we flinch right what the other here

5328
06:34:08,900 --> 06:34:10,900
I

5329
06:34:13,940 --> 06:34:15,940
Need to go get that I am

5330
06:34:19,220 --> 06:34:23,460
Get one guy from on software. I just keep speaking red. I'm like, I'm not actually peeking the mic

5331
06:34:23,460 --> 06:34:26,820
I don't feel like I'm getting that excited. I go red every time you talk, but

5332
06:34:29,540 --> 06:34:31,540
What am I going this way?

5333
06:34:32,980 --> 06:34:34,980
I'm trusting you

5334
06:34:35,300 --> 06:34:36,500
I

5335
06:34:36,500 --> 06:34:38,900
Don't know which way I'm going

5336
06:34:40,420 --> 06:34:42,660
I'm just whoa. Sorry

5337
06:34:44,180 --> 06:34:49,620
That wasn't me, but I apologize on behalf of the reason I will give you a voice when you have none

5338
06:34:50,500 --> 06:34:57,700
No longer will you feel shame for needing to ink and no longer will you feel shame for needing the a

5339
06:34:59,300 --> 06:35:01,300
What's the word um

5340
06:35:01,380 --> 06:35:04,500
The flipping a sense of belonging no long

5341
06:35:05,540 --> 06:35:08,180
No longer shall you feel shame for a sense of longing?

5342
06:35:08,740 --> 06:35:11,060
No more it ends here. I've had enough. I'm sick of it

5343
06:35:11,620 --> 06:35:16,900
Can we just be nice to each other and make each other feel good with her bodies? I mean, I'm actually really simple as that

5344
06:35:18,820 --> 06:35:20,820
I'm starting a new religion you want in

5345
06:35:20,820 --> 06:35:22,820
I

5346
06:35:28,420 --> 06:35:31,620
Feel like the shitposting comp on some of me helps the riskills

5347
06:35:36,740 --> 06:35:38,340
Cult of my mess

5348
06:35:38,340 --> 06:35:40,420
Crazy beaches for any

5349
06:35:40,420 --> 06:35:42,100
I don't know

5350
06:35:42,100 --> 06:35:44,100
Real one of the cult

5351
06:35:45,060 --> 06:35:47,060
Think ink before you think

5352
06:35:47,780 --> 06:35:51,220
Because how can you think properly without inking?

5353
06:35:52,740 --> 06:35:57,540
Exactly. Thank you. I'll be here all day. Um, no really. How about some endurance room?

5354
06:35:58,420 --> 06:36:02,420
Okay, let's beat this person up. Hello. It's time for you to perish

5355
06:36:03,300 --> 06:36:05,300
Hold on. Let me get to you

5356
06:36:06,500 --> 06:36:08,500
Enemy reeflings

5357
06:36:09,380 --> 06:36:11,380
Well, I missed

5358
06:36:12,740 --> 06:36:15,300
Oh, they have a bit of why is their hammer so big?

5359
06:36:18,020 --> 06:36:21,620
I like how all of us are just jumping them. I haven't had enough yet

5360
06:36:26,740 --> 06:36:28,740
Yeah

5361
06:36:29,060 --> 06:36:34,340
I'll hydrate I'll cheers after that. Okay. I've got a hammer a helmet

5362
06:36:37,860 --> 06:36:40,820
Okay, I'm asleep my cup of tea is now the correct temperature

5363
06:36:40,820 --> 06:36:47,460
That's fucking roasting. Yeah, right. I think I can drink it though

5364
06:36:49,220 --> 06:36:53,140
You need the horse for the bridge you got to do it without the reef ones. Don't say such things

5365
06:36:54,580 --> 06:36:57,940
Don't say such things out loud surely that can't be true

5366
06:37:00,020 --> 06:37:02,020
That I actually need the horse to do this

5367
06:37:03,700 --> 06:37:05,700
Is it true

5368
06:37:06,580 --> 06:37:14,900
Calm down calm down. I don't know. He's going for it. He's the fuck I'm always go that way this way

5369
06:37:16,740 --> 06:37:18,740
Calm down you sit here and level up

5370
06:37:22,180 --> 06:37:24,180
What and who is that?

5371
06:37:28,660 --> 06:37:32,900
Are you are you the way to go kill a boss for me? Are they?

5372
06:37:33,860 --> 06:37:40,580
Oh my god, I've not defeated one of those yet. Uh dad just let the reeflings do it

5373
06:37:43,060 --> 06:37:47,780
I don't what are you celebrating them dying? I don't know

5374
06:37:51,300 --> 06:37:58,820
Are we cheering from the sidelines go reeflings? Yeah, yeah, hi. What's it come pie?

5375
06:37:59,300 --> 06:38:05,220
Oh, no, let me cheers. No, just beat the attack on one side then run the opposite side

5376
06:38:06,660 --> 06:38:08,660
I don't are they going for it

5377
06:38:11,540 --> 06:38:14,740
Good luck from way over here come back

5378
06:38:16,580 --> 06:38:21,140
I mean they may be able to roll and smoke them. I don't I don't know how he does it

5379
06:38:21,940 --> 06:38:23,620
Oh

5380
06:38:23,620 --> 06:38:26,900
For mommy you got wi patch for your battles

5381
06:38:27,780 --> 06:38:30,020
Join them be the leader they need

5382
06:38:32,260 --> 06:38:34,900
Their secret behind the waterfall no

5383
06:38:37,140 --> 06:38:43,060
Oh my gosh, what what are we even supposed to do against that? I'm not being funny. What are we supposed to do against that?

5384
06:38:43,460 --> 06:38:45,460
Um

5385
06:38:50,980 --> 06:38:55,220
You can trust them those golems have a lot of nasty aoe really

5386
06:38:57,620 --> 06:39:03,140
Hit his legs knock it over. I don't know how small like I'm I'm rather small

5387
06:39:03,300 --> 06:39:06,660
It's a shame that you had to learn this way that I'm like tiny but

5388
06:39:07,220 --> 06:39:09,220
Uh

5389
06:39:09,620 --> 06:39:15,700
In the wise words of Scottish. I'm literally totally how did you even get over there? What? Oh, you have to jump down

5390
06:39:17,460 --> 06:39:24,340
Hydration right. I'm enjoying my cup of tea while watching them fight. How about that? What about you enemy reefling are you jumping down?

5391
06:39:27,620 --> 06:39:33,060
Um, oh are you watching? Oh my god, he's watching with a wee telescope. I don't have the

5392
06:39:33,780 --> 06:39:35,780
Wait, do I have a telescope? I don't think so

5393
06:39:37,460 --> 06:39:39,460
Are we telescope?

5394
06:39:42,820 --> 06:39:44,820
Are we telescope? I didn't have one

5395
06:39:45,460 --> 06:39:46,900
No

5396
06:39:46,900 --> 06:39:52,580
No, I didn't have one. I just trust they're doing fine from afar. I'm finishing my tea. Okay

5397
06:39:55,540 --> 06:39:59,940
How much extra damage if you throw it into the hole of the head? Oh, you give me it?

5398
06:40:01,060 --> 06:40:05,780
Oh, you give me a boiled crab. Wait, isn't that? Hey, that's my cousin. What the fuck?

5399
06:40:07,220 --> 06:40:14,420
Yeah, no, why don't you give me boiled crab? Oh, is this snacks to watch them? Okay, I'll eat the boiled crab

5400
06:40:15,700 --> 06:40:17,700
Greatly boost physical negation. Okay

5401
06:40:18,420 --> 06:40:20,420
Oh, you got lights and everything

5402
06:40:20,740 --> 06:40:24,260
Whilst we watch the poor reeflings in the distance fight their hearts out

5403
06:40:24,900 --> 06:40:27,780
It jumps. Oh my god

5404
06:40:29,620 --> 06:40:31,620
It jumps

5405
06:40:31,940 --> 06:40:33,940
Should I sit down for this?

5406
06:40:34,340 --> 06:40:36,820
Let me sit down. I'm sitting for this one

5407
06:40:43,780 --> 06:40:48,820
Okay, facebish is healing over to the right just to fail a reefland

5408
06:40:51,140 --> 06:40:53,140
He's getting put on fire

5409
06:40:54,900 --> 06:40:56,900
Glowing stones for I just brightness

5410
06:40:58,820 --> 06:41:02,340
Hi, I almost finished my tea. I'll come help after my tea surely

5411
06:41:04,900 --> 06:41:11,220
Look we're boosty. This is what say character sees a protagonist fights a giant monster in the distance. Honestly though

5412
06:41:12,900 --> 06:41:15,540
They just like oh, yeah, no, you're doing great. Keep it up

5413
06:41:18,580 --> 06:41:20,580
Mmm

5414
06:41:26,820 --> 06:41:31,140
Curious how many lights do you have? Oh

5415
06:41:33,940 --> 06:41:38,900
My god, the entire map is getting lit up by him. What's his health bar? I can't make it out

5416
06:41:46,100 --> 06:41:49,620
Uh, I think we may need to help

5417
06:41:51,540 --> 06:41:58,100
This is the part of the anime where you both discuss your power levels with flashy back stories. Okay, so I suck

5418
06:41:58,980 --> 06:42:03,940
Here's the genuine question does the host DLC level and effect damage given

5419
06:42:04,260 --> 06:42:09,860
I don't think my level affects that. I think you come in and it takes a percentage off of you no matter what you are

5420
06:42:10,100 --> 06:42:12,100
Does that make sense?

5421
06:42:16,100 --> 06:42:18,100
Got it reeflings

5422
06:42:18,820 --> 06:42:20,820
I mean, they're really doing good

5423
06:42:22,100 --> 06:42:24,100
I'm gonna go stomp, but

5424
06:42:24,260 --> 06:42:26,260
I want to go stomp, but

5425
06:42:29,220 --> 06:42:34,340
I'm guessing I need to go back through to the like I need to go past

5426
06:42:39,380 --> 06:42:42,900
Piss thread spear shred these enemies

5427
06:42:46,340 --> 06:42:48,340
Uh

5428
06:42:48,580 --> 06:42:51,540
Oh, no one reeflings down. I need to go past the enemy

5429
06:42:54,420 --> 06:42:57,780
Oh, no, it's up to just the fail. I'm getting nervous. Oh my god

5430
06:42:57,780 --> 06:43:01,940
Not me and the reefling fucking standing up at the same time because we're like we got a bad feeling about this

5431
06:43:03,220 --> 06:43:06,820
I got a bad feeling. I got a bad feeling about this. I don't know you

5432
06:43:07,460 --> 06:43:10,500
Yeah, I got a bad feeling too. No, I'm not gonna spank you with the fuck

5433
06:43:11,140 --> 06:43:14,580
Oh, sorry. Thank goodness. I'm sorry wrong one. I'm just supposed to be that one

5434
06:43:15,140 --> 06:43:21,140
No, oh my god. Sorry wrong one. It's this one. It's this one. I forget. This is the block. I'm sorry. This is the block

5435
06:43:21,300 --> 06:43:27,220
I always forget. There's a bonfire behind the giant, but do you have to kill the giant?

5436
06:43:30,260 --> 06:43:38,100
He's raging can you right enemy reefling you stay there. I'm gonna call in reinforcements. Okay, I'll call in reinforcements. I've got this, okay

5437
06:43:40,100 --> 06:43:42,100
Damn run out of heal. Yeah, I've got it

5438
06:43:42,980 --> 06:43:45,940
The giant is optional. You can avoid it. They're both dead

5439
06:43:47,460 --> 06:43:49,460
You stay there

5440
06:43:51,940 --> 06:43:53,940
Oh

5441
06:43:59,060 --> 06:44:01,060
No

5442
06:44:02,100 --> 06:44:04,100
Oh, no

5443
06:44:08,100 --> 06:44:11,700
Uh, how is he aggro to me?

5444
06:44:14,580 --> 06:44:16,980
Uh, does anyone want to be cannon fodder?

5445
06:44:17,700 --> 06:44:21,860
Anyone feel like being cannon fodder you perfect gorgeous come in now

5446
06:44:23,700 --> 06:44:27,140
Cannon fodder cannon fodder and you come

5447
06:44:28,180 --> 06:44:30,740
I'm gonna try and aggro it this way. I guess

5448
06:44:31,700 --> 06:44:33,700
And you come

5449
06:44:33,860 --> 06:44:37,940
Oh my gosh, that is terrifying

5450
06:44:39,780 --> 06:44:45,700
This is the part of the anime where the biggest bad guy kills everyone including the old bad guy that got turned into a good guy

5451
06:44:47,220 --> 06:44:51,460
Or we need reinforcements yesterday. That is his dire

5452
06:44:53,220 --> 06:44:58,260
He's picking on me. I'm not even near him. Are you even gonna make it?

5453
06:45:00,020 --> 06:45:02,020
Across the bridge

5454
06:45:02,740 --> 06:45:09,620
Are you get you going with it go go kill go? I urge you to go kill it

5455
06:45:10,740 --> 06:45:14,340
I his HP must still be lower. Oh, he's coming on the bridge

5456
06:45:15,300 --> 06:45:19,300
Oh, he got stuck. He got stuck get rekt get rekt right. I'm coming over

5457
06:45:20,980 --> 06:45:26,500
For emotional support, of course. Why is of course? Why is of course? Oh

Oh, you can see my eyes as well

5462
06:45:39,300 --> 06:45:41,300
Playing dressed it in press

5463
06:45:41,460 --> 06:45:43,460
But in Elden Ring instead

5464
06:45:44,500 --> 06:45:46,500
You can summon us on the bridge

5465
06:45:46,900 --> 06:45:48,900

Fuck it. I cannot watch anymore. It pains me to watch my poor reeflings

5479
06:46:39,060 --> 06:46:41,060
Get stomped by this guy

5480
06:46:42,580 --> 06:46:44,580
Follow you

5481
06:46:47,700 --> 06:46:49,700
Monkey have I gone the wrong way?

5482
06:46:54,660 --> 06:46:56,660
This summons

5483
06:46:58,340 --> 06:47:01,940
It heals up when I summon new reeflings. That's so rude

5484
06:47:02,500 --> 06:47:05,940
You guys you guys are doing great. Keep it up. Sweetie. You're doing fantastic

5485
06:47:06,740 --> 06:47:08,740
Where we going?

5486
06:47:09,220 --> 06:47:11,780
I swear if there's enemies down here, you're gonna get me freaked out

5487
06:47:15,300 --> 06:47:17,300
Is this how to get to the

5488
06:47:19,540 --> 06:47:21,540
Uh

5489
06:47:21,860 --> 06:47:26,500
Where did you go? I look away for a millisecond and you're gone

5490
06:47:29,140 --> 06:47:30,900
Oh

5491
06:47:30,900 --> 06:47:32,900
Sorry, I have a really slow

5492
06:47:33,140 --> 06:47:35,940
Framerate for my eyeballs. You have to go easy on me

5493
06:47:36,660 --> 06:47:39,380
You like blend in so much

5494
06:47:41,220 --> 06:47:43,460
Try jumping are you trolling?

5495
06:47:46,420 --> 06:47:52,420

5496
06:47:55,300 --> 06:47:57,300
What does that mean?

5497
06:48:00,820 --> 06:48:02,820
Yes, yes, what does it mean?

5498
06:48:03,540 --> 06:48:05,540
Uh

5499
06:48:06,500 --> 06:48:08,500
Don't you dare jump he's two-posing

5500
06:48:10,420 --> 06:48:18,660

5501
06:48:20,020 --> 06:48:22,420

5502
06:48:24,420 --> 06:48:26,580
Oh my gosh, where is the I?

5503
06:48:26,580 --> 06:48:28,580
I

5504
06:48:28,900 --> 06:48:33,780
I'm going. I don't know where I'm going. I'm just sending it. Surely this is safe over here

5505
06:48:38,740 --> 06:48:40,740
Do I need horsey-worsey?

5506
06:48:42,500 --> 06:48:46,180
I think I might need horsey-worsey to go where I need to go Torren

5507
06:48:49,780 --> 06:48:54,260
Not that way it's not safe here. Oh jeez you scared me

06:49:05,220 --> 06:49:08,500
You can you can sneak past as the reeflings distract it

5510
06:49:10,020 --> 06:49:18,900
Oh my gosh, okay. Thank you so much reefling for letting me sneak past. I'm a I'm an assassin. I'm a ninja. I'm one with the dark

5511
06:49:19,620 --> 06:49:21,620

06:49:22,180 --> 06:49:26,020

06:49:28,740 --> 06:49:32,660
This golem such a billy he is I don't even know how we take them down

5515
06:49:47,540 --> 06:49:50,100
Can you make it over or are you like insta dead?

5516
06:49:54,740 --> 06:49:58,180
There's an area you can attack from above. Yeah

06:50:00,340 --> 06:50:02,340
Okay, we got a new one over zero

I

5521
06:50:20,180 --> 06:50:22,180

5522
06:50:25,380 --> 06:50:27,940
Oh, he pissed am I supposed to be in the horse?

5523
06:50:33,140 --> 06:50:35,140

5533
06:51:23,380 --> 06:51:25,380

Okay, we're going up the stairs

5538
06:51:52,740 --> 06:51:55,460
They just bounce and balls around the place

5539
06:51:57,060 --> 06:52:02,580
Just randomly in hopes that an enemy one day will come across it like they just do this day in day out

5540
06:52:02,900 --> 06:52:04,900
Any difference? Any nothing?

5541
06:52:06,660 --> 06:52:08,660
They don't care

5542
06:52:09,140 --> 06:52:10,980
Oh go away

5543
06:52:10,980 --> 06:52:14,420
Enough I'm mad enough. I only have one reefland to help me

5544
06:52:17,540 --> 06:52:19,540
And I have no stamina

5545
06:52:23,780 --> 06:52:25,780
Ah, he's gonna give me blood loss

5546
06:52:31,460 --> 06:52:33,460

06:53:07,220 --> 06:53:09,860

06:53:14,100 --> 06:53:16,100

red flesh mushroom

5556
06:53:27,140 --> 06:53:29,140
third story

5557
06:53:30,420 --> 06:53:33,460
Hmm, I like so empty when there's only

5558
06:53:34,420 --> 06:53:36,420
Just the three of us

5559
06:53:37,220 --> 06:53:41,780
We can make it if we try just the three of us

5560
06:53:42,660 --> 06:53:44,660
Uh

5561
06:53:47,780 --> 06:53:51,620
New reefling come come come. Yes

5562
06:53:53,220 --> 06:53:55,220
The name is McCree

5563
06:53:59,540 --> 06:54:05,940
I didn't know it could reach me there. I don't think the golem liked me distract in it for so literally it was like, how dare you let her pass

5564
06:54:07,780 --> 06:54:09,780
I've passed the safety

5565
06:54:11,780 --> 06:54:14,580
Let me check me. Let me check me order

5566
06:54:15,700 --> 06:54:19,140
Oh my god, sorry. I was listening to the doctor disrespect

5567
06:54:21,140 --> 06:54:23,140
Um

5568
06:54:23,540 --> 06:54:26,900
Did you did you right? Sorry? I don't I don't know if you care about any

5569
06:54:28,180 --> 06:54:31,060
I was watching the doctor disrespect thinking about bobber

5570
06:54:31,940 --> 06:54:33,940
Um, because he streamed yesterday

5571
06:54:35,220 --> 06:54:36,740
um

5572
06:54:36,740 --> 06:54:40,020
And he was so what so apparently what happened was like

5573
06:54:40,740 --> 06:54:41,860
uh

5574
06:54:41,860 --> 06:54:44,420
There was a gag order on both parties

5575
06:54:45,220 --> 06:54:46,500
and

5576
06:54:46,500 --> 06:54:48,500
We're on earth. Are we going?

5577
06:54:48,660 --> 06:54:53,540
But because one side was broken he could talk about uh, um, and obviously everyone went

5578
06:54:54,340 --> 06:54:56,660
To the left. Yo, can I not come around?

5579
06:54:58,100 --> 06:55:00,100
The real chest

5580
06:55:03,780 --> 06:55:05,780
I know

5581
06:55:06,580 --> 06:55:13,700
It's high noon mummy, but he brian. Do you want to give that another one you want to give that another try brian?

5582
06:55:16,020 --> 06:55:18,020
Are you squinting me right now?

5583
06:55:19,060 --> 06:55:21,060
It's high here

5584
06:55:24,340 --> 06:55:26,820
I know it's mummy. No mummy

5585
06:55:28,100 --> 06:55:30,260
Thank you the real jesse mccree for the tip

5586
06:55:31,220 --> 06:55:33,380
No, it's mccree. They were carefully

5587
06:55:34,420 --> 06:55:36,420
I apparently called Cassidy new

5588
06:55:37,300 --> 06:55:38,900
actual

5589
06:55:38,900 --> 06:55:40,900
Down here

5590
06:55:41,540 --> 06:55:43,540
That's quite the drop. Are you sure?

5591
06:55:44,820 --> 06:55:50,260
Look i'm edging look i'm edging. Oh, I see that. Yeah, you're good at edging aren't you? Yeah, you would be wouldn't you?

5592
06:55:53,140 --> 06:55:55,140
Oh

5593
06:55:55,140 --> 06:55:57,140
I took a bit damage there

5594
06:55:57,380 --> 06:55:59,380
I'll show you how a real edger does it

5595
06:56:00,980 --> 06:56:02,980
Yeah, you ready for this? Oh

5596
06:56:03,300 --> 06:56:07,780
Slow and steady wins the race slow and fucking steady. You ready?

5597
06:56:09,380 --> 06:56:10,900
Oh, yeah

5598
06:56:10,900 --> 06:56:13,700
You can feel how slowly I'm touching it. Yeah

5599
06:56:15,220 --> 06:56:17,860
And just like that just like that no damage

5600
06:56:22,900 --> 06:56:24,900
Are we good in the edge

5601
06:56:30,820 --> 06:56:34,420
I'd stand up and do a random pause. My body is so sore from the ring fit

5602
06:56:35,220 --> 06:56:41,700
No more ring fit. Well, yes ring fit. I want to do a monthly ring fit just to you know, check that i'm still the strongest fastest

5603
06:56:42,980 --> 06:56:46,020
MLGist uh viola, you don't have to make sure I have to make sure

5604
06:56:50,100 --> 06:56:57,700
And I still hold my tail if the girls like play ring fit on stream i'm getting them to add me on the switch so I can

5605
06:56:58,260 --> 06:56:59,940
um

5606
06:56:59,940 --> 06:57:06,020
Beat all their high scores and stuff. I will not rest until I have like perfect. I don't care. I will not rest

5607
06:57:08,580 --> 06:57:11,460
I know of a way of increasing ring fit and squat gains

5608
06:57:11,620 --> 06:57:15,700
So I played hard the first time I played a bad really overdid it whereas that time

5609
06:57:16,180 --> 06:57:19,060
Like I gave myself a rest and I didn't end up feeling sick

5610
06:57:19,060 --> 06:57:23,860
I felt a wee bit sticky at one point, but I like took a break and it was perfectly fine

5611
06:57:24,340 --> 06:57:26,980
I can't believe it. I can't believe if

5612
06:57:27,940 --> 06:57:29,220
you

5613
06:57:29,220 --> 06:57:34,500
If you listen to your body and don't overdo it. It actually works. I can't believe

5614
06:57:36,180 --> 06:57:41,540
I took a big nap. We're still we still play and we're doing the the same. I still got the reflins carrying me through the game

5615
06:57:42,580 --> 06:57:48,260
You have to defend your wrestling tail. Honestly that. Oh, do you think's the strongest? Obviously me. I'm the fat

5616
06:57:48,340 --> 06:57:53,380
I'm faster than you. I'm stronger than you talisman of all the crucibles. Show me

5617
06:57:53,780 --> 06:57:58,340
I have curiosity. Show me grants effects of all

5618
06:57:59,460 --> 06:58:02,260
Crucible crucible

5619
06:58:03,460 --> 06:58:09,860
Crookable madness and the vicinity increases your tact power. That's the whale talisman. Yeah, what one this one?

5620
06:58:10,900 --> 06:58:12,900
Truly this one

5621
06:58:13,860 --> 06:58:17,220
I meet tacos. Are they ching? They're ching

5622
06:58:19,780 --> 06:58:21,780
I'm ready when you are

5623
06:58:24,020 --> 06:58:28,020
I think azure would pin you down in the ring without breaking a sweat

5624
06:58:30,740 --> 06:58:33,620
Do you mean lore wise or actually in person wise?

5625
06:58:37,620 --> 06:58:39,620
Lore wise no, I don't win

5626
06:58:40,740 --> 06:58:46,100
Um, emmy actually. Well, it would go zero and then emmy unless you want to get technical

5627
06:58:46,980 --> 06:58:49,860
When it comes to gods and demons and stuff then maybe emmy

5628
06:58:50,820 --> 06:58:53,380
But it wouldn't be her actual physical strength and prowess

5629
06:58:55,300 --> 06:59:00,900
Strongest thought I'm stronger. I'm smart. I'm not smarter now. They can keep the smart title this way

5630
06:59:02,340 --> 06:59:04,340
Okay

5631
06:59:06,660 --> 06:59:09,460
Oh, there's enemies they're hiding

5632
06:59:09,940 --> 06:59:11,940
Oh

5633
06:59:13,460 --> 06:59:20,980
Lollipop domines oh my whoa, we're getting sniped. I don't know where I can't see them. Oh, I see them

5634
06:59:23,780 --> 06:59:25,780
Okay

5635
06:59:26,740 --> 06:59:29,860
Yeah, that's right hit that staircase. We're gonna. Oh materials

5636
06:59:32,500 --> 06:59:34,500
How do we get to him?

5637
06:59:35,380 --> 06:59:37,380
Whoa

5638
06:59:37,460 --> 06:59:40,260
There's a dog biting at my ankles. Get your dog

5639
06:59:44,980 --> 06:59:46,980
I don't even know how to reach him. I can't

5640
06:59:48,900 --> 06:59:50,900
I assume this is wrong

5641
06:59:51,140 --> 06:59:52,980
Oh, yeah

But I got a full refund so please don't worry

Um, and then I got my lego hobbit set and it was a big treatee

5919
07:21:10,980 --> 07:21:16,980
Because I was talking about it and then anonymous just gave me $500 and I was like, what the fuck

5920
07:21:17,300 --> 07:21:22,900
Because I was looking up the prices because it's an it's a hobbit set. So it's not like I recently produced like it's only

Yeah, I was just talking about wanting it and I looked up the price it was 500 and then

5933
07:22:06,740 --> 07:22:11,940
If you didn't know two minutes later anonymous gave me a $500 don't know and I was like, oh shit. Well

5950
07:23:23,620 --> 07:23:25,860
At least let me roll out of it if I hit water

Oh, no

5983
07:26:12,660 --> 07:26:16,260
All right, just because you're pretty it doesn't mean you get to kill my reeflings. Do you understand?

5984
07:26:16,740 --> 07:26:18,740
Oh

07:26:19,620 --> 07:26:21,620

You don't fuck it

5995
07:27:04,580 --> 07:27:07,140
No, she's got a reefling in a grip hold

5996
07:27:08,100 --> 07:27:13,700
Only I'm allowed to do that. No, okay, we're to see we're to see

6012
07:28:21,700 --> 07:28:24,900
My right, okay, let me level up

6013
07:28:28,020 --> 07:28:31,060
Uh, what was it this one? Oh, there you go

6014
07:28:32,020 --> 07:28:36,500
So what I can build that weapon now. What was it? What was the weapon?

07:28:39,060 --> 07:28:41,060

What's the dagger this

6017
07:28:45,140 --> 07:28:48,820
What I do is that right if I press B on the d-pad right, what I do is that?

6018
07:28:51,300 --> 07:28:53,300
Oh, that's it

6019
07:28:56,820 --> 07:28:58,820
Okay

6020
07:29:01,300 --> 07:29:03,300
Oh

07:29:04,820 --> 07:29:08,500
Okay, I like that I'm here for it

6022
07:29:09,940 --> 07:29:13,220
Week four head uh tingling. Oh no

6023
07:29:14,900 --> 07:29:18,420
Got to burn the tree this tree. I can't go on

6024
07:29:20,660 --> 07:29:27,060
Mommy the final area might take a long time. You might want to take a break here. No my food's coming. Let me check. Hold on

6025
07:29:27,780 --> 07:29:35,780
I don't know if you guys whenever you order food. It always says driver has been assigned for like ever

6026
07:29:37,300 --> 07:29:42,420
I just constantly says drivers been assigned and then that's when I know I'm getting nice lukewarm cold food

6027
07:29:45,380 --> 07:29:47,380
You can wield to it once

6028
07:29:49,380 --> 07:29:51,380
I'll only have one on my person

6029
07:29:57,540 --> 07:30:02,260
Read message do it try fire and then ah, it's like a dream

6030
07:30:04,100 --> 07:30:06,600
Examine ceiling tree burn the tree

6031
07:30:13,060 --> 07:30:15,060
Burn the tree

6032
07:30:15,940 --> 07:30:17,940
Okay burning tree

6033

Man fuck nature. It's me. I'm nature

Give me what I want

6035
07:30:27,780 --> 07:30:31,380
I'm gonna flash back to when we burnt the other tree

6036
07:30:33,220 --> 07:30:36,500
Now the little graphics quality sentence coming in on that shader on the tree

6037
07:30:38,500 --> 07:30:41,140
It's having a little moment. It's flickering

6038
07:30:43,220 --> 07:30:45,220
It's stuttering

6039
07:30:48,260 --> 07:30:51,300
Hmm watch it all burn

6040
07:30:51,300 --> 07:30:53,300
Oh

6041
07:30:54,580 --> 07:31:01,780
We have access to another part of the map question mark what was hiding behind these thorns

6042
07:31:06,180 --> 07:31:08,180
It's like a mirage effect

6043
07:31:12,020 --> 07:31:14,020
Mm-hmm

6044
07:31:17,380 --> 07:31:19,380
Curious

6045
07:31:21,540 --> 07:31:24,020
Curious indeed, what does it mean?

6046
07:31:30,340 --> 07:31:32,900
Sure, but the ball should take away

6047
07:31:36,180 --> 07:31:40,420
That's a lot of stairs. I hope you guys have been squatting along with me

6048
07:31:43,380 --> 07:31:46,500
We're gonna make it like I'll do it do

Oh

07:33:26,260 --> 07:33:28,260
Can I open this door no

6067
07:33:32,580 --> 07:33:34,580
I kneel to this

6068
07:33:36,420 --> 07:33:38,420
Don't insult my new

6069
07:33:41,940 --> 07:33:43,940
I just wish we were laying at the end. I'm like we play

6070
07:33:44,420 --> 07:33:49,700
Okay, this is gonna be very interesting using these weapons. So please don't expect me to do anything in the fight

6071
07:33:50,580 --> 07:33:53,540
I'm just gonna panic swap to my other weapon

6072
07:33:55,220 --> 07:33:59,700
I'll see how this goes. Oh the old trees leaking madness

6073
07:34:00,660 --> 07:34:03,940
What was our quest again? Are we to stop the tree from leaking madness?

6074
07:34:04,900 --> 07:34:07,300
Are we to stop madness overall?

6075
07:34:08,500 --> 07:34:10,500
You really trying to scare me?

6076
07:34:14,340 --> 07:34:18,100
The naves have a really short range. Oh dear. Well, we're about to find out

6077
07:34:19,620 --> 07:34:21,620
Give me him

6078
07:34:24,100 --> 07:34:26,740
I mean if it's a fate honestly

6079
07:34:31,300 --> 07:34:33,540
Oh, he flies they fly now, sorry

6080
07:34:35,380 --> 07:34:37,380
The star wars brain rot's too real

6081
07:34:38,340 --> 07:34:40,340
I

6082
07:34:40,660 --> 07:34:46,900
Why are you going for me? I'm doing the least damage against you. I'm just mucking up over these naves honestly

6083
07:34:52,500 --> 07:34:54,500
Curious

6084
07:34:59,780 --> 07:35:01,780
Are the names upgraded at all? Ah

6085
07:35:01,940 --> 07:35:08,660
I'm glad you beat the rot centipede. I may have a

6086
07:35:11,060 --> 07:35:17,540
Yes, I may have had some help. This is true. Okay. I think I might have to swap back to my two handers because I believe I've levelled this up

6087
07:35:18,820 --> 07:35:23,620
Even if they're upgraded their damage is pretty poor overall. Hmm thinking thinking thinking

6088
07:35:26,020 --> 07:35:28,260
We can always muck about and do bosses after

6089
07:35:29,220 --> 07:35:31,220
Touch grace, okay, touchy the point

6090
07:35:33,700 --> 07:35:35,700
J'arrive

6091
07:35:35,940 --> 07:35:42,420
Don't do the point. Yeah, I arrive in the point. No j'arrive on the point

6092
07:35:43,620 --> 07:35:46,420
This someone says go out but you're saying going up. I go up

6093
07:35:48,660 --> 07:35:50,660
Bonsoir

6094
07:35:50,980 --> 07:35:52,980
You

6095
07:36:12,740 --> 07:36:14,740
That's the best French again, I'm sorry

6096
07:36:15,700 --> 07:36:23,700
And that's the best French again, there's no more senses. I tried to see I'm playing with my friends. I love my reeflings

6097
07:36:28,820 --> 07:36:30,820
Let's jump on

6098
07:36:33,220 --> 07:36:35,220
Can you speak Aussie next?

6099
07:36:35,940 --> 07:36:39,060
Uh, I used to be able to and what does it Australian people sound like?

6100
07:36:39,780 --> 07:36:41,140
And

6101
07:36:41,140 --> 07:36:48,500
Today on the news we are reporting that the reeflings are fixing the game now with these

6102
07:36:49,300 --> 07:36:50,580
accusations

6103
07:36:50,580 --> 07:36:56,100
Elden ring is being played in unison with the streamer known as strony cuddles

6104
07:36:56,820 --> 07:37:00,660
however, there is something controversial she is doing for the

6105
07:37:02,020 --> 07:37:07,620
Development team for this game did not intend for it to be played in such a way

6106
07:37:10,020 --> 07:37:16,100
The only Aussie accent I can mimic is the news. I can't actually do a casual Aussie accent like it just doesn't happen

6107
07:37:18,740 --> 07:37:24,260
I don't know what Australia you're living in the house, right? Well, it's from the news and I'm trying okay

6108
07:37:24,420 --> 07:37:30,660
I'm I spawned in Scotland. Okay. Here's the facts. I spawned in Scotland. I saw I've got

6109
07:37:31,780 --> 07:37:33,780
Yeah, hard is

6110
07:37:34,340 --> 07:37:36,340
To mimic an accent that's not yours

6111
07:37:36,660 --> 07:37:44,660
Now Aussie news anchor sound like that. Yes, they kind of have some sort of nasal capacity

6112
07:37:45,780 --> 07:37:49,860
Oh, it appears I have walked into the enemy's damage

6113
07:37:52,020 --> 07:37:55,460
These enemies do not oh, where did my reefling go?

6114
07:37:57,060 --> 07:38:01,220
Where did my enemy reefling go? Did you jump off the map by accident? Are you there?

6115
07:38:02,180 --> 07:38:04,180
Oh

6116
07:38:06,020 --> 07:38:08,020
He's alive

6117
07:38:08,980 --> 07:38:12,820
I didn't look where I was walking. Uh, if we get invaded it's ogre

Take me where we need to go because I don't know where we need to go. I'm just here from Idaho

Oh

07:59:00,720 --> 07:59:02,720
I

6348
07:59:02,720 --> 07:59:04,720
I

6349
07:59:04,720 --> 07:59:06,720
I

6350
07:59:06,720 --> 07:59:08,720
I

6351
07:59:27,000 --> 07:59:30,680
I'm inhaling. I'm in here. I'm telling you as fast as I can okay

6352
07:59:31,680 --> 07:59:37,920
Hello everyone, my name is Johnny calls and this is a mukbang today. We're eating and drinking cola

6353
07:59:50,360 --> 07:59:56,080
I were drinking juice as well. There's no way Elden you can role play so easily in Elden

6354
08:00:00,680 --> 08:00:03,280
I thought we're at the end of the game almost

6355
08:00:06,040 --> 08:00:10,600
Dependent on what happens we're either finishing off Elden ring tomorrow

6356
08:00:10,600 --> 08:00:12,600
Oh

6357
08:00:23,200 --> 08:00:28,560
And I'm somewhere in the sky I burnt the thorns at the tree. I

6358
08:00:29,880 --> 08:00:31,880
Don't know where exactly I'm

6359
08:00:32,080 --> 08:00:34,800
For them. Oh, yeah, I can't open up my map

6360
08:00:37,160 --> 08:00:39,160
Why are you flashing red?

6361
08:00:41,000 --> 08:00:50,200
I'm trying to eat so but you haven't spaghetti either cooking mom. Oh for delicious

6362
08:00:54,200 --> 08:00:58,000
So in Australia they have a thing called chicken salt which isn't around the world

6363
08:00:58,000 --> 08:01:01,440
But I think I'm gonna send the girls chicken salt like a wee packet of it

6364
08:01:01,440 --> 08:01:05,160
And well, it's not enough. I didn't come in a packet comes in like a wee cylindrical pub

6365
08:01:11,480 --> 08:01:13,480
I

6366
08:01:20,320 --> 08:01:23,040
Chicken salt is literally only oceanic

6367
08:01:24,760 --> 08:01:31,880
Like Australia and New Zealand Perry Perry, so yeah, Perry poor souls really good. I agree

6368
08:01:40,840 --> 08:01:42,840
I'm eating them stuff in my face

6369
08:01:56,640 --> 08:02:01,200
I've almost done a promise. I'm not well, I am taken by

6370
08:02:02,200 --> 08:02:04,200
I

6371
08:02:06,120 --> 08:02:10,760
Will me I'm checking on you. I'm eating this is my first meal

6372
08:02:10,760 --> 08:02:18,480
I woke up at midnight and it's now noon. So it's 12 hours and a slept like eight or seven hours

6373
08:02:19,440 --> 08:02:25,200

6377
08:03:02,200 --> 08:03:04,200
I

6378
08:03:06,160 --> 08:03:08,160
Actually

08:03:08,360 --> 08:03:14,120
This is a fantasy I have about you relating to being tired read it to yourself if it pushes the limit I

6380
08:03:17,280 --> 08:03:21,280
Want to pick you up and put you in bed and kiss you on the forehead while you talk about

6381
08:03:22,480 --> 08:03:29,720
Me saving you an Elden ring. Love you. Oh, that's so cute. I love me there. I thought we're gonna be bad

6382
08:03:31,200 --> 08:03:33,200
That wasn't bad. Oh

6383
08:03:34,520 --> 08:03:36,520
That was romantic

6384
08:03:45,200 --> 08:03:47,200
Oh

6385
08:03:50,280 --> 08:03:56,240
The Elden Ring stream has been tons of fun even if I was feeling too shy to play today. Oh, don't worry. Don't be shy

6386
08:03:56,240 --> 08:03:58,040
I don't bite hard

6387
08:03:58,040 --> 08:04:02,200
Get job surviving the drip inspector so the drip inspector kills you I

Don't know that take your time and enjoy your food. Yes. Yes. I'm taking my time

6389
08:04:12,240 --> 08:04:18,580
What do you mean I'm swallowing so fast loads of ears getting trapped I promise I'm taking my time to eat my food

6390
08:04:19,120 --> 08:04:25,000
What are you on about? I'm not rushing rushing me. No, I'm taking my time

6391
08:04:25,720 --> 08:04:27,720
Ten a 10

6392
08:04:27,880 --> 08:04:31,080
I'm eating so fast all the ears getting trapped

6393
08:04:33,440 --> 08:04:36,400
All yours all for you

6394
08:04:36,720 --> 08:04:38,720

Okay, I'm almost finished I promise actually I'm getting close to finish

6396
08:04:58,680 --> 08:05:08,320
The flavor profile at Bart was Barry come play. Oh, no, do you have one of those things in your head where you can like taste and hear stuff or something I?

6397
08:05:08,880 --> 08:05:09,960
Swear

6398
08:05:09,960 --> 08:05:17,440
There's a thing where if someone sees a number it tastes like yours like something. Oh my god. Is that weird? I'm so sorry

6399
08:05:28,800 --> 08:05:30,800
You can smell the tickle

6400
08:05:40,800 --> 08:05:42,800
There's dragons everywhere

6401
08:05:47,080 --> 08:05:52,680
This is good, this is what I needed to finish the DLC. That's right here

6402
08:05:53,240 --> 08:05:55,240

I'm making you want to see you

6408
08:07:04,000 --> 08:07:10,880
Controversial but the best part about the chicken burger is the lettuce on it because it's so nice and crunchy and like

6409
08:07:11,800 --> 08:07:15,200
If the chicken is still like fried really well, I'll still be crunchy

6410
08:07:16,160 --> 08:07:18,280
But that is the best part

6411
08:07:18,280 --> 08:07:20,280

I

6426
08:08:52,040 --> 08:08:54,040
I

6427
08:09:13,320 --> 08:09:15,320
Okay, but controversial

6428
08:09:15,640 --> 08:09:21,880
Can I just see how much I love being a VTuber and buck-ass naked literally just flashed my ass to the fucking camera

I'm embarrassed don't don't rate that don't I'm embarrassed. That was awful a

6436
08:10:00,240 --> 08:10:06,800
Frickin baby coughing up spittle would have done better than that. That was terrible on my controller. Oh

08:10:07,800 --> 08:10:15,440
Yeah, oh my god. Oh, it's stuck stuck in my throat

6438
08:10:19,720 --> 08:10:21,720
It's

6439
08:10:22,680 --> 08:10:24,680
Hold a man, but

6440
08:10:25,080 --> 08:10:31,240
You need to do a plate pain the delivery boy with your body audio now. Oh, you like that

08:10:59,280 --> 08:11:01,800
Impassable barrier. I'm stuck door stuck

Is there so smart is there so smart that was a much better one

6449
08:11:15,520 --> 08:11:21,840
Dubstep burp. Oh, do you think I could pay someone to make a edit of my burps surely?

Okay, where are we going? I literally cannot see because you put all this stuff down

Okay, there you go

6462
08:12:24,760 --> 08:12:26,760
Don't wait for the lift to come back down

6463
08:12:29,000 --> 08:12:34,320
You start stream when I'm at work the Ring Fit stream was bad enough

6464
08:12:35,680 --> 08:12:40,280
I got so many nice compliments about the Ring Fit stream. I was so proud of myself

6465
08:12:41,360 --> 08:12:43,720
Did you like the part where I was panting like a dog?

6466
08:12:46,480 --> 08:12:50,660
Like the part where I proved I wasn't wearing any armor

6467
08:12:50,660 --> 08:12:52,660

My babies, I can't progress without you. I can't progress with you actually for once

6498
08:15:46,980 --> 08:15:48,980
The red summit sings a mini boss

08:15:51,700 --> 08:15:56,140
Be summoned to challenge needle knight ledder and her allies I

6500

Get to keep the refunds, right?

6501
08:16:00,060 --> 08:16:02,820
They get to be with me during this surely

6502
08:16:03,820 --> 08:16:08,620
Surely the reason it's good to be with me during this like if she gets allies, why don't I get out like?

6503
08:16:10,180 --> 08:16:12,380
No, no, no, we're not starting this we're not standing

6504
08:16:12,380 --> 08:16:15,940
You're no allowed to have just what you want just cuz you want it like I want it to all right

6505
08:16:15,940 --> 08:16:21,220
So either fairs fair and we both have summons or only I get summons. That's how it works. All right

6506
08:16:21,740 --> 08:16:24,340
It's like right. Okay, my reasons with me

6507
08:16:26,500 --> 08:16:32,380
Needle knight ledder dryly dame and our ally will never allow

6508
08:16:33,700 --> 08:16:36,900
Well, they better start alone it. I'm not having this attitude

6510
08:16:42,980 --> 08:16:44,980
Then he bothered getting his attitude

6511
08:16:50,380 --> 08:16:54,100
Oh my god, fuck him up fuck him up show him how you really feel refunds

6512
08:16:56,540 --> 08:16:58,980
Redeem our clan now your shite didn't bother

6513
08:16:59,740 --> 08:17:06,740
The only clan is the refling gang you come to the wrong urge tree

6514
08:17:11,780 --> 08:17:17,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, he's not rising anything actually he's a fanboy he might rise a few things

6515
08:17:17,740 --> 08:17:19,740
But you know what me

6516
08:17:22,100 --> 08:17:24,100

Oh, yeah, yeah, you know what's gentle mean the refunds we fucking this place up first and then we'll make it gentle, okay

6518
08:17:36,900 --> 08:17:45,020
You come to the wrong trios man, this is a reef gang territory led in our team should invest in poise honestly

6519
08:17:46,140 --> 08:17:48,140
This is what invading feels like

6520
08:17:48,940 --> 08:17:50,940
I like how the fight and punishes

6521
08:17:51,300 --> 08:17:52,420
completionist

6522
08:17:52,420 --> 08:17:56,580
This fight punishes completionist. I guess it was one

6523
08:17:57,100 --> 08:17:59,100
That was easier than I thought

6524
08:17:59,300 --> 08:18:04,620
With the reeflings anything is possible. That's what you need to take away from this

6525
08:18:06,900 --> 08:18:11,420
Right, so now there's corpses not to get political, but

6526
08:18:12,340 --> 08:18:14,340
Okay, and we're gonna pillage the court

6527
08:18:15,580 --> 08:18:17,580

6528
08:18:19,020 --> 08:18:23,500

6532
08:18:42,460 --> 08:18:47,500
Lydia's armor. Yeah, but it's a better than mine. I don't think not shite get out of here

6533
08:18:48,500 --> 08:18:53,380
What shite armor you should think twice about using that stuff. No wonder you died. You can summon more in here. I

6534
08:18:54,100 --> 08:19:00,220
Says there's no tingling available. I know I'm calling it tingling. Yes. I'm a child it goes tingling

6535
08:19:00,820 --> 08:19:04,540
It goes tingling when I use it. Okay, so tingling a link. I

6536
08:19:06,140 --> 08:19:08,540
Don't want to hear none. I want to hear none. Oh

6537
08:19:09,220 --> 08:19:11,220
Oh

6538
08:19:12,780 --> 08:19:17,820
My god, is it lagging out? Okay, is there any other refunds able to tingling a link?

6539
08:19:20,180 --> 08:19:26,660
Yes, all muscles relax and so do your intestines rather fails. I mean when you pop your clogs

6540
08:19:27,420 --> 08:19:29,420
you look like

6541
08:19:29,420 --> 08:19:32,260
the Oogida bees from Star Wars the

6542
08:19:32,740 --> 08:19:37,540
the traders and Star Wars and this and and on

6543
08:19:38,140 --> 08:19:42,740
Tatooine, I call them Oogida bees because that's what I call them as a child. I

6544
08:19:44,660 --> 08:19:46,660
They trade

6545
08:19:46,940 --> 08:19:53,060
He's not being in last over zero or just a fellow just a fellow. You've not been in

6546
08:19:57,540 --> 08:20:02,420
You should unsummon the refland Jawa's are the raiders. No, they

6547
08:20:03,620 --> 08:20:07,140
Them guys they're called the Oogida bees. I don't know why

6548
08:20:08,020 --> 08:20:10,020
the

6549
08:20:10,020 --> 08:20:13,580
Guys are the Sun stroke or they know

6550
08:20:15,420 --> 08:20:24,020
Jawa's no wrong. It's Oogida bees. I called them that when I was young and the name will never change

6551
08:20:25,660 --> 08:20:28,060
Okay, and then we got enemy. No enemy

6552
08:20:28,060 --> 08:20:30,060
Oh

6553
08:20:35,740 --> 08:20:37,740
Our Tuscan readers

6554
08:20:38,140 --> 08:20:42,500
Star Wars watch along when May 4. Oh, no, I'm playing Lego Star Wars on May 4

6555
08:20:43,500 --> 08:20:46,460
I guess no refland raiders work here

6556
08:20:48,980 --> 08:20:53,540
Oogida bees. Yeah, I think cuz I'm misheard them as a child and

6557
08:20:53,820 --> 08:21:00,420
They said the word Oogida bees or it sounded like they said Oogida bees and then that was just their name like and

6558
08:21:01,740 --> 08:21:03,740
Ball bowling ball

6559
08:21:08,380 --> 08:21:10,380

6569
08:22:23,660 --> 08:22:25,660
I

6570
08:22:28,420 --> 08:22:30,420
Wait

6571
08:22:34,260 --> 08:22:39,140
How do I respawn it isn't it not like the Ender Dragon and Minecraft

6572
08:22:43,940 --> 08:22:46,020
You could summon me into the Fae

6573
08:22:46,020 --> 08:22:48,020
I

6574
08:22:52,260 --> 08:22:56,380
Mean your game plus so is there no way for me to respawn that

6575
08:22:57,100 --> 08:23:03,340
Get a refland to summon you into the fight. Okay, right. What's the password? What's the password reflands? Let me in?

6576
08:23:10,580 --> 08:23:14,220
Put your golden sign down outside here

6577
08:23:16,860 --> 08:23:18,860
I

6578
08:23:20,980 --> 08:23:25,300
Literally have never been summoned in before I know how to do this hold on

6579
08:23:27,660 --> 08:23:33,440
Add a finger create creates a common sign sure why not

6580
08:23:36,140 --> 08:23:40,100
That is it mine, okay, I'm called Fondola, okay, I

6581
08:23:40,620 --> 08:23:42,620
I

6582
08:23:42,940 --> 08:23:50,900
Mean mommy made the final what a bizarre glitch truly wholeheartedly. What a bizarre glitch. I I cannot even

6583
08:23:52,260 --> 08:23:57,540
Put into words how bizarre that was we found a quicker shot than you honestly

6584
08:23:59,460 --> 08:24:05,380
Make sure whoever summons her isn't on new game plus you're being summoned. Oh my god a refland picked me up already go on then

6585
08:24:05,700 --> 08:24:13,140
Let me see the cutscene and everything because I don't know what's actually here. Oh my god

6586
08:24:15,140 --> 08:24:17,140
Hmm

6587
08:24:17,220 --> 08:24:19,140
That is the most

6588
08:24:19,140 --> 08:24:21,140
Okay

6589
08:24:21,220 --> 08:24:24,420
Okay, right. Are you getting more refland than two?

6590
08:24:25,860 --> 08:24:28,500
Surely you're gonna pick up another refland, right? Surely

6591
08:24:29,220 --> 08:24:30,820
Surely

6592
08:24:30,820 --> 08:24:32,820
Okay

6593
08:24:32,820 --> 08:24:34,820
There should be another

6594
08:24:35,060 --> 08:24:38,020
Um, surely summoning another co-op. Okay. Okay

6595
08:24:42,580 --> 08:24:48,100
Thank you for saving the stream. I'm really appreciative what a bizarre glitch I

6596
08:24:48,820 --> 08:24:55,060
So when you said unsummon the reflands obviously in the most respectful way, I'll say this brutally honest way

6597
08:24:56,100 --> 08:25:02,660
There's no way I could have predicted that the result of going up the elevator on co-op was it would kill the boss

6598
08:25:02,740 --> 08:25:08,580
And you have to be honest with me and agree with me. Oh that like no, there's no way I could have thought that was going to be the result

6599
08:25:09,780 --> 08:25:10,820
Okay

6600
08:25:10,820 --> 08:25:12,820
Oh god, this is not gonna go well

6601
08:25:13,140 --> 08:25:16,740
Aren't I like super like bad as well like worldwide?

6602
08:25:18,500 --> 08:25:24,740
Okay, I'm gonna just eat a lobster. Okay. I'm yeah, I'm ready for the fight. Okay. They're like really hammering themselves up

6603
08:25:24,740 --> 08:25:26,740
I'm like, yeah, let's go

6604
08:25:27,220 --> 08:25:29,220
Okay, what happened

6605
08:25:30,180 --> 08:25:32,180
No cutscene shit

6606
08:25:35,780 --> 08:25:37,780
What the fuck

6607
08:25:39,300 --> 08:25:42,820
Uh, is this how you guys fight?

6608
08:25:44,660 --> 08:25:49,700
I've only got five potions. Is this how you guys fight?

6609
08:25:49,700 --> 08:25:51,700

08:25:56,580 --> 08:26:00,420

08:26:11,140 --> 08:26:13,140
Oh

6614
08:26:27,140 --> 08:26:29,620
Did you know people in the uh

6615
08:26:31,060 --> 08:26:35,700
Up north Scotland have rosy cheeks because the wind scars their cheeks red

6616

6617
08:26:42,020 --> 08:26:44,020

6635

Okay, uh, sure. Let's level up these as well. Why not? I have picked up quite a few

6636

6639
08:28:44,420 --> 08:28:47,780
Complete the base game. Shit. I don't know. I don't see why not. I don't see why not

Are you winning? Oh, yeah, we might be winning a little too hard controversial

6645
08:29:12,660 --> 08:29:17,220
Might have won a little too hard by accident, but that's okay

6646
08:29:17,380 --> 08:29:22,580
Hey, I think the disconnect was why it changed the player to me never had that before

Okay, grabbing my crab. Okay. I'm ready. Yeah

Champion of your deeds will ever be praised in song

6663
08:30:35,380 --> 08:30:38,100
And my lord brother soul will return

6664
08:30:40,660 --> 08:30:43,540
So that he may be my console

6665
08:30:43,540 --> 08:30:45,540
Oh

08:30:56,420 --> 08:31:01,540

08:31:07,540 --> 08:31:10,340
Remember when millennia millennia

6669
08:31:10,900 --> 08:31:15,700
Whispered something to redan's ear before she exploded into a flourish told redan this was gonna happen

6670
08:31:17,140 --> 08:31:19,140
Oh, so he had to be scarlet rod

6671
08:31:23,940 --> 08:31:28,180
Clown shoes. Oh leave my clown. Okay. I can no challenge

6672
08:31:29,140 --> 08:31:31,140
Okay

6673
08:31:33,220 --> 08:31:35,220
Mm-hmm

6674
08:31:36,660 --> 08:31:41,220
I mean I could get my little we sort out if you want like I'm helping I'm helping

6675
08:31:44,340 --> 08:31:46,340
They're not even reaching him

6676
08:31:47,860 --> 08:31:52,740
My little three inch daggers and I know you heard it here folks. I'm getting shamed

6677
08:31:53,140 --> 08:32:00,580
I'm getting shamed. Oh wow it takes stamina to throw it. I mean I guess

6678
08:32:02,180 --> 08:32:04,180
Is that even hitting him?

6679
08:32:07,860 --> 08:32:09,860
It's not even him

6680
08:32:11,620 --> 08:32:15,300
Bro get my two handed sordid right now. Hold on. Whoa

6681
08:32:17,860 --> 08:32:21,220
How did you do that much damage? Hold on. I ain't got my double sordid

6682
08:32:23,220 --> 08:32:28,980
Redan was trying to avoid being his brother's console or understandable literally, how can I say?

6683
08:32:31,940 --> 08:32:33,940
Holy damn it literally

6684
08:32:35,220 --> 08:32:40,100
Okay, do not get ejected. I'll try my best. Please don't eject me

6685
08:32:41,860 --> 08:32:43,860
And bled the hell over much more

6686
08:32:47,940 --> 08:32:49,940
So then the fem boy appears

6687
08:32:53,700 --> 08:32:56,660
At the long last you are returned

6688
08:32:58,820 --> 08:33:00,820
Is that boys voice or a girl voice?

6689
08:33:05,620 --> 08:33:08,900
I think that's a girl voice actually tarnished one

6690
08:33:11,380 --> 08:33:13,860
Aspiring lord of the old order

6691
08:33:15,860 --> 08:33:19,700
If you have no sin if you agree for this world

6692
08:33:20,100 --> 08:33:22,100
Hmm

08:33:22,500 --> 08:33:25,060

08:33:34,260 --> 08:33:36,980
And my promised consort we're done

6696
08:33:38,580 --> 08:33:44,980
Okay, I believe me. Okay. I'm too handed. Whoa

6697
08:33:44,980 --> 08:33:46,980
Oh

6698
08:33:48,580 --> 08:33:53,540
Can you leave him alone? What does this mean? I don't like it

6699
08:33:58,820 --> 08:34:04,660
Uh, can you leave me alone? Ow, please leave me alone

6700
08:34:06,180 --> 08:34:10,180
Well, I'm already a freaking healing practically. I'm just going to start with a damn fight

6701
08:34:11,860 --> 08:34:13,860
It's the best I can do my little

6702
08:34:15,060 --> 08:34:20,260
Oh my god, you're hugging my wiefling only. I'm allowed to do the struggle snuggle. Let him go

6703
08:34:21,940 --> 08:34:23,940

I don't have anything

6707
08:34:41,540 --> 08:34:43,540
I don't want to get too close in case I die

6708
08:34:45,380 --> 08:34:47,380
Don't let him hug again. He's being

6709
08:34:48,340 --> 08:34:50,820
Michael listed. Okay. That's actually really funny

6710
08:34:52,100 --> 08:34:54,100
Don't make me laugh at that

6711

Okay, I don't know if I should go in for the fight or let them try it. Yeah, I'm gonna die. I'm so sorry

You want to go back to the main game that we're not complete yet?

6785

We unlocked the Elden Throne

6788
08:41:25,700 --> 08:41:27,220
But we didn't

6789
08:41:27,220 --> 08:41:29,220
Did we win on the Elden Throne?

6790
08:41:32,500 --> 08:41:34,500
I don't remember getting this far

6791
08:41:37,860 --> 08:41:39,860

6797
08:42:06,020 --> 08:42:08,820
Need to do the fate by the fire giant which is him

6799
08:42:15,540 --> 08:42:17,540
Here

6800
08:42:19,780 --> 08:42:21,460
Hmm

08:42:28,020 --> 08:42:30,420
Uh, right fire giant is this way. So

6807
08:42:45,380 --> 08:42:47,380

6808
08:42:47,700 --> 08:42:49,700
We bam doesn't know that way

6809
08:42:50,820 --> 08:42:53,060
The grand lift brings you to the top where the fire is

6810
08:42:54,740 --> 08:42:56,740
Are you the grand lift be honest? No

6811
08:42:57,380 --> 08:42:58,500

Oh, it's like I have to go all the way over there

6815
08:43:09,220 --> 08:43:11,220
How did I get there?

6816
08:43:13,220 --> 08:43:15,540
You want east capital rampart

6817
08:43:16,100 --> 08:43:18,100
East capital rampart

6818
08:43:19,700 --> 08:43:21,700
Grace for the fastest axis

6819
08:43:24,340 --> 08:43:29,780
Horn's scent did nothing wrong at all. By the way, they were on the cusp of achieving great things

6820
08:43:31,060 --> 08:43:33,860
You go to the lift to open a huge door

6821
08:43:35,460 --> 08:43:37,460
Not on my own I do

6822
08:43:38,820 --> 08:43:40,820

Right. I'm not fighting them. They're not my problem. Don't care. Don't aggro to me

You're making me upset. I'm on my own. Okay

08:44:40,260 --> 08:44:43,700
I don't have backup the way I used to have backup. So I'm not cocky any

6836
08:44:45,540 --> 08:44:47,300
It's fine

6837
08:44:47,300 --> 08:44:49,300
It's good. We're fine

6838
08:44:49,460 --> 08:44:51,300

08:47:29,140 --> 08:47:32,260
Oh, does it? Whoa enemy. Hold on

6880
08:47:44,980 --> 08:47:49,860
Not miss your chance to blow this opportunity that comes once in a lifetime

This is abuse. I'm off. No, this isn't. Nope. I don't have a horse in this race quite literally

6884
08:48:11,620 --> 08:48:16,980
I don't have a horse in this race. I do not care to fight unless I have my replay

6885
08:48:20,340 --> 08:48:24,020
No, it's fine. I didn't want to fight. I don't want to fight. I don't want to fight. I'm out of energy

6886
08:48:24,420 --> 08:48:26,840

Even though it was a little bit frightening

6890
08:48:47,220 --> 08:48:49,220
Expert timing

6891
08:48:51,940 --> 08:48:54,820
Although it was a funky kind of man

Take the lift in the middle

08:56:21,940 --> 08:56:23,940
DLC gamer I

08:56:28,420 --> 08:56:35,300
Okay, but don't get too close. That's what I don't want to do is get too close when he swings that thing

6980
08:56:36,580 --> 08:56:38,580
When he starts swinging it's ogre

6981
08:56:39,620 --> 08:56:41,860
Whoa, his items just loaded in for me

6982
08:56:42,660 --> 08:56:45,380
Did he was he fighting handless that entire time?

6983
08:56:48,020 --> 08:56:50,020
He might have been

6984
08:56:53,300 --> 08:56:56,580
Oh, oh my gosh, we're good. We're good

6985
08:56:57,700 --> 08:56:59,700
Damn right enemy fail

6986
08:57:00,500 --> 08:57:02,500
I'm moaning

6987
08:57:03,380 --> 08:57:05,780
Jeez that was a beast of an enemy

6988
08:57:09,220 --> 08:57:11,780
You made work of them. Holy crap

6989
08:57:13,460 --> 08:57:17,380
I uh, I need to go summon you again. Oh, I'm alive. I'm a horse so good

6990
08:57:19,940 --> 08:57:23,380
Hi tauren. Oh look at the physics on my robe

6991
08:57:23,940 --> 08:57:29,300
Will someone please admire the physics on the robe? Look at that. Just straight balling on that thing

6992
08:57:31,540 --> 08:57:37,540
Just gorgeous gorgeous. Look at that. I love a good physics on some some clothes in

6993
08:57:40,980 --> 08:57:42,980
Uh

6994
08:57:43,780 --> 08:57:50,180
Okay, I touched the grave. Can I get you in? No, I can't get you in not allowed

6995
08:57:50,260 --> 08:57:52,260
And

6996
08:57:52,580 --> 08:57:55,540
You need to go up the lift before you can summon. Okay, let's

6997
08:57:56,660 --> 08:58:02,020
Do the grand old juke of york. He had 10,000 man

6998
08:58:02,980 --> 08:58:07,300
He marched them up to the top of the hill and he marched them down again

6999
08:58:07,780 --> 08:58:12,500
Oh when they were up they were up and when they were down they were down

7000
08:58:14,020 --> 08:58:17,940
And when they were only halfway round they were either helping them

7001
08:58:18,900 --> 08:58:20,900
There you go

7002
08:58:21,940 --> 08:58:27,540
Oh he rotating. Look at the dust coming off. Look at that. That's right. There would be layers of dust on that bad boy

7003
08:58:42,180 --> 08:58:45,380
You march them up to the top of the hill when you march them

7004
08:58:48,900 --> 08:58:50,900
And

7005
08:58:52,580 --> 08:58:54,260
Ooh

7006
08:58:54,260 --> 08:58:56,180
I'm no

7007
08:58:56,180 --> 08:58:57,700
Elevator

7008
08:58:57,700 --> 08:59:01,860
Do you think that's why they're called elevators because they elevate you to a higher position

7009
08:59:03,940 --> 08:59:05,700
Or elevate you

7010
08:59:05,700 --> 08:59:09,780
Can a blue reefling be summoned to um blue abodee abodee

7011
08:59:10,660 --> 08:59:13,220
And no way you did it right on my toes

7012
08:59:14,580 --> 08:59:16,580
Who's not had a shot in hot seconds

7013
08:59:18,260 --> 08:59:20,260
Uh, I need to check

7014
08:59:21,140 --> 08:59:22,500
Yeah

7015
08:59:22,500 --> 08:59:25,700
You just had evil leaf on time dex. We had a shot

7016
08:59:28,500 --> 08:59:34,340
Rushing your enemy and then it's over. No fuck you moved

7017
08:59:35,780 --> 08:59:37,780
The one at my feet I was at your next

7018
08:59:39,380 --> 08:59:44,260
I was over zero. That's you you're nice. Okay, so over zero

7019
08:59:44,580 --> 08:59:46,580
And

7020
08:59:47,220 --> 08:59:49,220
Then

7021
08:59:49,300 --> 08:59:51,300
Russian

7022
08:59:51,940 --> 08:59:54,500
And then enemy refling smart

7023
08:59:59,220 --> 09:00:01,780
I don't even know how to keep track of this. I'm just so MLG

7024
09:00:02,660 --> 09:00:07,620
Good luck with the rest of the game. Thank you so much. Rest well or sleep well or

7025
09:00:08,340 --> 09:00:11,460
Get food well eat a fucking mouse if you're eating. Um

09:00:12,420 --> 09:00:18,100
It's 5 a.m. Over here. Oh, please. Yes, please sleep. Oh, no, I'm so sorry. We've been please sleep

7027
09:00:18,820 --> 09:00:21,140
Go to sleep. I get kissed asleep

7028
09:00:22,740 --> 09:00:26,740
Go to sleep go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep refunds

7029
09:00:27,540 --> 09:00:29,540

09:00:30,180 --> 09:00:32,500
I'm just pinching you don't show my pinching

7031
09:00:33,220 --> 09:00:37,620
Relative just eight. We're doing a late game shenanigans. Okay by late game

7032
09:00:37,620 --> 09:00:42,100
We mean base game shenanigans because we skipped the base game to play the dlc and never

7033
09:00:42,660 --> 09:00:44,660
Never doing the fire giant up here

7034
09:00:45,620 --> 09:00:47,620
Mounting top of the giant

7035
09:00:49,060 --> 09:00:51,060
So go to sleep if you need a rest

7036
09:00:52,980 --> 09:00:54,980
Because we're just bum rushing the

7037
09:00:58,260 --> 09:01:02,260
What's the map look like? Oh, no, do I need horsey-worsey?

7038
09:01:03,140 --> 09:01:05,220
I might need horsey-worsey to progress

7039
09:01:06,020 --> 09:01:08,020
I forgot about this

7040
09:01:08,900 --> 09:01:11,780
Oh, no, this was the guy that killed his body

7041
09:01:13,460 --> 09:01:15,620
And he's like skin walking as him

7042
09:01:16,500 --> 09:01:19,460
Are we beating them up? He's a bad man

7043
09:01:21,220 --> 09:01:23,220
He's a bad bad man

7044
09:01:23,780 --> 09:01:26,100
Who would be lord oh my

7045
09:01:28,420 --> 09:01:35,380
Why the long face I fear that you were previously acquainted with this vessel. You're a bad man

7046
09:01:36,020 --> 09:01:38,020
That is most unfortunate

7047
09:01:39,300 --> 09:01:41,860
For he is dead and how did he die?

7048
09:01:44,500 --> 09:01:46,500
He gave it to me

7049
09:01:46,900 --> 09:01:48,900
I

7050
09:01:49,540 --> 09:01:51,540
Hope you can make your peace with

7051
09:01:52,980 --> 09:01:55,380
Uh, I mean did he give it up

7052
09:02:08,740 --> 09:02:10,740
Uh

7053
09:02:11,300 --> 09:02:13,300
Are we beating them up

7054
09:02:14,260 --> 09:02:15,300
I

7055
09:02:15,300 --> 09:02:22,100
Time for attacking. Oh the grace site. Sorry. Mummy's playing. Mummy's no garlic. So I'm sorry. Sorry

7056
09:02:23,620 --> 09:02:25,620
He is letting you get

7057
09:02:26,580 --> 09:02:28,580
Are we beating him up?

7058
09:02:31,620 --> 09:02:34,900
He gave it keep talking to him. Hello

7059
09:02:38,100 --> 09:02:40,100
Dear to tread

7060
09:02:43,620 --> 09:02:46,900
The poor girl if you are prepared to show resort

7061
09:02:47,780 --> 09:02:50,900
And attain lordship through righteous hardship

7062
09:02:52,340 --> 09:02:54,340
The words of I

7063
09:02:55,540 --> 09:02:57,540
Shabri

7064
09:02:58,820 --> 09:03:00,820
Shabri

7065
09:03:04,820 --> 09:03:09,780
Mm-hmm audience with the three fingers and the flame of frenzy

7066
09:03:10,500 --> 09:03:14,660
If you inherit the flame of frenzy your flesh

7067
09:03:15,700 --> 09:03:18,500
Or to save doing mommy doing

7068
09:03:21,620 --> 09:03:23,620
Should we do it like that

7069
09:03:26,580 --> 09:03:29,620
The path of the lord of chaos

7070
09:03:30,740 --> 09:03:32,740
Burn the earth tree

7071
09:03:33,300 --> 09:03:35,060
to the ground

7072
09:03:35,060 --> 09:03:36,660
and incinerate

7073
09:03:36,660 --> 09:03:37,540
all

7074
09:03:37,540 --> 09:03:40,500
that divides and distinguishes

7075
09:03:41,540 --> 09:03:45,140
Oh may chaos take the world

7076
09:03:45,460 --> 09:03:47,460
He's the kill. Oh, I wouldn't want to kill everything

7077
09:03:47,940 --> 09:03:49,940
Take the world

7078
09:03:50,900 --> 09:03:55,220
Honestly, we just killed kain the mackayla so we could burn the world as a fit in

7079
09:03:56,180 --> 09:03:58,180
Did we do the chaos one?

7080
09:03:58,580 --> 09:04:00,260
Chosen the tarnis and descend

7081
09:04:00,420 --> 09:04:02,420
Okay, okay. All right. Wrap up wrap up

7082
09:04:03,540 --> 09:04:05,140
Uh

7083
09:04:05,140 --> 09:04:07,940
May chaos take the world. Do you want to do the chaos ending?

7084
09:04:08,740 --> 09:04:11,700
I've never done it before or would it like ruin it if we did

7085
09:04:12,900 --> 09:04:15,940
All right, I'm jumping him. He's my problem. Fuck you beach

7086
09:04:16,820 --> 09:04:18,820
No, don't you start casting spells on me?

7087
09:04:20,260 --> 09:04:22,260
Oh, we all

7088
09:04:26,100 --> 09:04:29,380
Oh my gosh, these things are this guy bad

7089
09:04:31,140 --> 09:04:33,140
He's bad news

7090
09:04:35,540 --> 09:04:39,140
Has a cut in a secret ending cutscene if you spare the girl

7091
09:04:41,060 --> 09:04:47,780
Millennia will get mad at you, but I still don't have to sacrifice or do if I thought if you got the frenzied flame

7092
09:04:48,580 --> 09:04:53,540
You could burn the tree and not sacrifice out, but you could still pick a different ending when you kill

7093
09:04:55,140 --> 09:04:57,140
Am I going mental?

7094
09:04:58,820 --> 09:05:03,780
Thing is we would need to be millennia in case we want to revert the frenzy flame

7095
09:05:04,180 --> 09:05:06,180
Wait, you need to kill

7096
09:05:07,540 --> 09:05:10,900
There's too many aims in this game and too many ours as well. We'll might up

7097
09:05:14,420 --> 09:05:20,740
Is that coming after me? I hear something. Oh, it's an eagle. I was gonna say I could I swear I can hear something

7098
09:05:25,060 --> 09:05:27,060
We're getting barred

7099
09:05:27,780 --> 09:05:29,780
I

7100
09:05:32,180 --> 09:05:39,700
To heal the frenzy flame you need the unalloyed needle obtained from this place which was killing millennia wait, I could

7101
09:05:40,580 --> 09:05:45,220
Is millennia my maid my maid my maiden?

7102
09:05:53,220 --> 09:05:55,220
What's the name of my maiden again

7103
09:05:56,180 --> 09:05:58,180
Melina

7104
09:05:58,420 --> 09:06:00,420
Melina is me then

7105
09:06:01,780 --> 09:06:03,700
of a fuck

7106
09:06:03,700 --> 09:06:05,700
malena blade of mackayla

7107
09:06:06,580 --> 09:06:09,300
But we can still kill blade of mackayla, right?

7108
09:06:12,740 --> 09:06:16,660
Oh scarlet retusie. Yeah, we're gonna kill the scarlet retusie anyway

7109
09:06:21,460 --> 09:06:23,460
Uh

7110
09:06:24,180 --> 09:06:26,900
So what's the problem? I got you to carry me through it. Okay

7111
09:06:28,100 --> 09:06:32,500
Uh, what's the what's the what's the problem me? What's the problem?

7112
09:06:36,580 --> 09:06:43,780
Don't do it don't do it if you have to kill your maiden. No, I don't want to kill her. I want to keep her alive

7113
09:06:47,140 --> 09:06:51,140
Uh, no, don't take all the aims my brain's gonna start moving them all together

7114
09:06:51,460 --> 09:06:57,860
Right is this the manual are we gonna make it across alive? Be honest

7115
09:07:02,100 --> 09:07:04,100
There is no way I'm gonna comprehend

7116
09:07:04,660 --> 09:07:10,740
So this is how it plays out in my head. I go grab frenzied flame. I destroy tree

7117
09:07:11,380 --> 09:07:13,380
I I destroy the thorns

7118
09:07:13,540 --> 09:07:15,540
But then I do a side quest to

7119
09:07:16,260 --> 09:07:22,660
De frenzy myself that way maiden didn't have to die everyone lives happily ever after the end

7120
09:07:26,820 --> 09:07:30,820
As tempted as I would be to go for that no horsey walk honestly

7121
09:07:31,620 --> 09:07:35,380
That is correct. Okay. I don't see a problem with that, right?

7122
09:07:36,580 --> 09:07:40,660
And then that way she lives and we still get a different ending because I married my

7123
09:07:40,820 --> 09:07:41,940
Uh

7124
09:07:41,940 --> 09:07:50,260
The that was incredibly lucky timing. Um, I married Rihanna. Nope. Her name's not Rihanna. That's the singer's name. Um

7125
09:07:53,140 --> 09:07:54,740
The blue one

7126
09:07:54,740 --> 09:07:57,380
My lovely blue doll. I married the doll

7127
09:07:58,020 --> 09:08:00,340
So I've not done it where I become the lord

7128
09:08:01,140 --> 09:08:02,580
so how about

7129
09:08:02,580 --> 09:08:07,140
We don't sacrifice our maiden and we become a lord

7130
09:08:07,940 --> 09:08:09,060
Amen

7131
09:08:09,060 --> 09:08:13,780
Thank you Rani. There we go. See coastal Rihanna. I was near that offer

7132
09:08:16,020 --> 09:08:18,580
Melina doesn't die at all. What does that mean?

7133
09:08:19,860 --> 09:08:21,860
That's right. Fight me bitch

7134
09:08:22,580 --> 09:08:24,580
Fight me bitch

7135
09:08:25,540 --> 09:08:27,540
Fight me bitch

7136
09:08:30,420 --> 09:08:33,540
I'm out of stamina. Hold on. I'll fight you in a moment. Let me breathe

7137
09:08:34,500 --> 09:08:40,340
Through the secret ending is like a direct tie into the lord of frenzied flame ending so it will look out of place

7138
09:08:41,060 --> 09:08:45,460
The one with the doll. Aye the doll that I'd shag honestly. I'd fucking beat the shit out of her

7139
09:08:48,740 --> 09:08:54,100
No whole left unseasoned. That's not very nice. Don't say that out loud. Um

7140
09:08:54,980 --> 09:08:59,060
It works fine saying did it after unknowingly taking the flame so she could get the Rani end

7141
09:08:59,860 --> 09:09:02,100
It's a long quest time to get the needle

7142
09:09:03,060 --> 09:09:07,540
A part of which would require a fight where you can't summon. Right. We're not doing it. Sorry tihi

7143
09:09:07,620 --> 09:09:13,620
I'm just becoming ill done lord. Tihi. Sorry. Sorry my wee maiden sauce, but you're getting burnt to a crisp. Tihi

7144
09:09:14,180 --> 09:09:19,220
What's that not allowed the reef lens? Well, I hope you like things nice and hot and toasty darling

7145
09:09:20,820 --> 09:09:22,820
Not my problem anymore

7146
09:09:23,460 --> 09:09:25,460
Not my problem anymore

7147
09:09:27,540 --> 09:09:29,540
A fight without my my darling

7148
09:09:30,500 --> 09:09:34,900
And it really is it was in with someone fight exactly see I know you understand

7149
09:09:36,100 --> 09:09:40,500
It's time to push my line off a cliff. I literally oh right off the pop and you were destined to do whatever

7150
09:09:40,580 --> 09:09:46,660
Whatever other piss your mum fucking told you to brainwashing. I think and it was normal to get fucking burnt to a crisp. Uh, yeah off you pop

7151
09:09:47,540 --> 09:09:49,060
Hmm

7152
09:09:49,060 --> 09:09:51,620
I hope you like Hawaii. It's nice and warm over there

7153
09:09:53,540 --> 09:09:57,540
Bit of vitamin d from the sun. Nice toasty warm. Let's go for it

7154
09:09:59,540 --> 09:10:03,860
Okay, and then we become elder lord. You have Millicent helping you if you did that fight

7155
09:10:07,300 --> 09:10:09,300
Okay, let's be up this guy

7156
09:10:09,380 --> 09:10:14,020
I mean, how long is the needle quest we could muck about and do it tomorrow if you want

7157
09:10:15,780 --> 09:10:18,900
I have two hours left. Come on. That's not enough time

7158
09:10:21,220 --> 09:10:24,180
There's actually not enough time in the day to stream

7159
09:10:25,940 --> 09:10:27,940
I can't believe it

7160
09:10:29,620 --> 09:10:33,140

7162
09:10:42,180 --> 09:10:48,420

7163
09:10:48,740 --> 09:10:54,580
Nido is not so long. You just teleport to five points spam talk then fight a monster and some NPCs

7164
09:10:55,220 --> 09:10:59,620
Right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I think we'll do the frenzy flame. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it

7165
09:11:00,180 --> 09:11:02,180
We'll do the frenzy flame and we'll play

7166
09:11:02,500 --> 09:11:07,620
Whoa, we'll play elden ring tomorrow as well. So I don't need to be creative and think of anything smell

7167
09:11:08,660 --> 09:11:10,660
Okay, we're gonna be up this giant

7168
09:11:11,780 --> 09:11:16,900
I can't sleep as long as mommy screams aren't your eyes like bulging out your skull from tiredness?

7169
09:11:17,540 --> 09:11:23,060
I'm not exactly a streamer. You put on to fall asleep to either because when I get excited I start getting really loud

7170
09:11:25,540 --> 09:11:30,740
I'm gonna get like really loud. I can't help it. It just gets what happens

7171
09:11:33,940 --> 09:11:38,020
Okay, I'll stick the word right so we'll grab frenzy flame so we can save little

7172
09:11:39,300 --> 09:11:44,340
Maid and then we'll undo it. Okay. We'll undo it. We'll be good boys and girls and undo it

7173
09:11:46,020 --> 09:11:49,060
That's the good part the Scottish for shame. I have fucking bam

7174
09:11:51,540 --> 09:11:53,540
I'm not supposed to be up here

7175
09:11:55,140 --> 09:11:57,140
I'm not to be up here

7176
09:11:57,620 --> 09:11:59,620
I don't know. Are you good me right now?

7177
09:12:02,740 --> 09:12:04,980
No, you're gonna give yourself a heart attack

7178
09:12:07,300 --> 09:12:09,620
Don't have energy drink just to stay up

7179
09:12:11,460 --> 09:12:13,460
That's bad

7180
09:12:14,020 --> 09:12:20,260
Sleep if you need to sleep you can always like watch me in times two and if you have youtube vans you can watch me in times five

7181
09:12:20,900 --> 09:12:23,540
Oh, I don't even know if you'd understand what i'm saying at that point

7182
09:12:24,420 --> 09:12:26,420

Mummy up and fighting speed sounds like a fever dream honestly

7188
09:12:49,140 --> 09:12:51,140
It's against it

7189
09:12:51,460 --> 09:12:53,460
I don't know what you're talking about

7190
09:12:53,540 --> 09:13:06,540
I'd use an advancement and advancement. Yes, that's the word I use. Use bird's-eye telescope.

7191
09:13:06,540 --> 09:13:16,540
Eh? Oh look! I can see you from up here! Hi, reflings! Where's enemy refling? I don't

7192
09:13:16,540 --> 09:13:25,540

7193
09:13:25,540 --> 09:13:39,540
here! Did that cost me five souls to use? Okay, fight. You hate this boss? Oh, is this

7194
09:13:39,540 --> 09:14:00,540
where the fog comes down? I can see my refling. I can see my husband here. Where is he? I mean,

7195
09:14:00,540 --> 09:14:12,540
careful what you wish for, but where is he? Hello? Hello? Are you here? Okay, I should have

7196
09:14:12,540 --> 09:14:22,540
been careful. I'm sure he is. He's spawning in somewhere. Oh, something's happening. I can't

7197
09:14:22,540 --> 09:14:26,540
see shit. I don't know about- fuck it, I'll put my light on. There you go. I'm helping. There you go. I can see

7198
09:14:26,540 --> 09:14:34,540
through the snow storm. Yeah, I'm sure that light helps. Ow! Something's getting me. Fucking

7199
09:14:34,540 --> 09:14:39,540
busty crustaceans are going for me. Oh, I found him. I found him. Didn't you worry, I found

7200
09:14:39,540 --> 09:14:52,540
him. Big body Alice, the freezing fog. I bet ya. Oh, I'm out of energy. Hold on. Alright.

7201
09:14:53,540 --> 09:15:05,540
What is going for me? Ow! Whoa, that fucking damage is insane. Do I have like zero magic resistance?

7202
09:15:05,540 --> 09:15:15,540
I think so. I must have like limited magic resistance. That's terrible. Stop it. Oh, that's not

7203
09:15:15,540 --> 09:15:20,540
your arm. I need my glasses on. I'm so sorry. Did you- I thought that rock was his wing. I got

7204
09:15:20,540 --> 09:15:29,540
so excited. I was like, oh my god, easy peasy attack. Dumbass. Fucking dumbass. I sure showed

7205
09:15:29,540 --> 09:15:43,540
that rock who's boss. Oh god, I'm actually gonna hit him. Okay, that'll do. Whoa, whoa, whoa, please

7206
09:15:43,540 --> 09:15:52,540
don't. Please don't die. Don't be selfish, Reflins. Don't leave me to fight this boss.

7207
09:15:52,540 --> 09:16:09,540
Don't be selfish. Why are you going for me? Good thing I got stamina, but it's not going

7208
09:16:09,540 --> 09:16:23,540
for me now. Oh, I got good wall upon him there. I can't see nothing. Okay, he's not going

7209
09:16:23,540 --> 09:16:29,540
for me. He's going for the jellyfish? Yeah, fuck that jellyfish up. Show it who's boss.

7210
09:16:29,540 --> 09:16:35,540
Show it who runs this lake. What does that move mean? I don't know. Oh, it just means

7211
09:16:35,540 --> 09:16:48,540
ice storm. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Let's get closer. Oh, roll. Okay, well, I did want to

7212
09:16:48,540 --> 09:17:04,540
roll, but I was already in attack mode, so. Oh, I'm getting away. This is hard. Oh my god, please

7213
09:17:04,540 --> 09:17:10,540
go for his feet. Okay, I hit his wing. You're welcome. I hit his wing on the way out. That

7214
09:17:10,540 --> 09:17:23,540
breath of ice is insane damage. It's actually Buckus. Oh, you got him. You got him. You did

7215
09:17:23,540 --> 09:17:30,540
it. You did it. Go, Reflin, go. Go, Reflin, go. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's your birthday.

7216
09:17:30,540 --> 09:17:35,540
Hold on a minute. Real quick before you disappear. It's your birthday. It's your birthday. Oh,

7217
09:17:35,540 --> 09:17:41,540
yeah. Oh, yeah. It's your birthday. Let's go together. Birthday. I tell you, you can use the

7218
09:17:41,540 --> 09:17:50,540
birthday. I found a very similar years. Okay. Why would you tell me that now? Defeat the dragon.

7219
09:17:50,540 --> 09:17:58,540
By the way, did you know? No, I didn't. I didn't, but sure. Right. We go this way now. You need

7220
09:17:58,540 --> 09:18:07,540
to be someone. I will find a place to summon you. There's a church here. Maybe there is a seed.

7221
09:18:07,540 --> 09:18:16,540
Sorry, I just realized how bright I am for the section of the game. Sorry. I'll make myself less

7222
09:18:16,540 --> 09:18:23,540
be. It's because you used the one we'll encode more, but it can't show you tutorials. Oh. Go, Reflin, go.

7223
09:18:23,540 --> 09:18:37,540
Proceeds to vanish, honestly. I just, wait. Hold on. I get wary of these churches because they always

7224
09:18:38,540 --> 09:18:48,540
seem to have a fight in them. I don't seem to see the white trails either, suggesting that it's a save station.

7225
09:18:48,540 --> 09:18:58,540
Or do I? No. Fuck off. I don't trust it. I don't trust it. I want Reflin. Go away. Let's go back to the road.

7226
09:18:59,540 --> 09:19:06,540
On the road again. I never fought in a church, Elden Ring. It's safe. Are you sure?

7227
09:19:12,540 --> 09:19:17,540
A mummy, the glowing angel down from the heavens. The thunderous clap deafening all those who witnessed.

7228
09:19:17,540 --> 09:19:24,540
No, go into that church. Okay. I just remember all the... I never even saw that. That was so far away.

7229
09:19:24,540 --> 09:19:34,540
Oh, get off the horse, please. Okay, we grab the Sacred Tear, and then we sit down at the Grace, which is y'all?

7230
09:19:34,540 --> 09:19:42,540
Hawaii? And then we sit down here. Can I even level up, or is it...? I can.

7231
09:19:42,540 --> 09:19:50,540
I could just put into health. Why not? Max out of health, YOLO. And then Flask? Yeah.

7232
09:19:50,540 --> 09:19:55,540
Okay, we've got an extra Flask. Feels good, man. We can talk to... No, I don't want to talk to her. Sorry.

7233
09:19:55,540 --> 09:20:00,540
She's not going to be happy with what I'm about to do in a minute. I don't want to talk to her. She's going to spank us.

7234
09:20:00,540 --> 09:20:08,540
We've been naughty. I'm sorry. Oh, my shoulders hurt. What do you mean?

7235
09:20:08,540 --> 09:20:14,540
Right, hold on. Let me check if there's someone who's not been here for a hot day. Tarnished. I don't know you.

7236
09:20:14,540 --> 09:20:21,540
Okay, Income Tarnished. Yarnished to Arlene.

7237
09:20:21,540 --> 09:20:26,540
Got to sleep early tonight. Good luck. Good luck on your sleeping early. Rest well.

7238
09:20:26,540 --> 09:20:29,540
Edge Lord McGee, you've not been in.

7239
09:20:35,540 --> 09:20:41,540
And who's my evil refund? Who's not being evil? You've not been evil very often.

7240
09:20:41,540 --> 09:20:46,540
I don't even think you've been evil once, actually. Oh, there's only two? Those are blood spots.

7241
09:20:46,540 --> 09:20:50,540
Okay, you can be evil if you're slim, then.

7242
09:20:50,540 --> 09:21:00,540
Navigol. W stream. What, I think? You mean getting my handheld through the game is a dub?

7243
09:21:00,540 --> 09:21:04,540
Well, yes, I agree. I couldn't agree more, actually.

7244
09:21:04,540 --> 09:21:10,540
Am I just a drip inspector shows up to see what I've done? Ah, I would definitely fail.

7245
09:21:10,540 --> 09:21:16,540
I think the drip inspector knew that I swapped out clothes really quickly.

7246
09:21:16,540 --> 09:21:21,540
Oh, you want, you want blessed? Okay, I'll bless you. Sorry.

7247
09:21:21,540 --> 09:21:26,540
I'll get, can enemy roofling move away so I don't accidentally hit you because I don't want the battle music to play.

7248
09:21:26,540 --> 09:21:31,540
It's really annoying when it plays. I bless, I bless.

7249
09:21:31,540 --> 09:21:37,540
Are you cowering? You cannot cower from my buttocks.

7250
09:21:37,540 --> 09:21:40,540
My buttocks, my cheeks will always find you, I assure you.

7251
09:21:40,540 --> 09:21:44,540
Ah, right, I guess we just go this way.

7252
09:21:44,540 --> 09:21:52,540
Back on the road, and then once we're on the road it should be fine, right? Right, right.

7253
09:21:52,540 --> 09:21:59,540
It's expected to change an earfinest drip for the drip inspector? Okay, so I'm not gonna get exposed for...

7254
09:21:59,540 --> 09:22:04,540
Where is that map? Oh, it's up ahead. Like, on the path.

7255
09:22:05,540 --> 09:22:12,540
Hey, Momay, how flexible are you? I can put my legs behind my head.

7256
09:22:12,540 --> 09:22:16,540
Like that, if he was one HP in a dream.

7257
09:22:16,540 --> 09:22:22,540
I believe in you guys, you got this.

7258
09:22:22,540 --> 09:22:28,540
My legs are super flexible. My back, unfortunately, I injured it.

7259
09:22:29,540 --> 09:22:44,540
I used to go to the gym, and it was a guy, gym assistant, and he went, long story.

7260
09:22:44,540 --> 09:22:50,540
Oh no, that's a shame. I think he was a long story short.

7261
09:22:50,540 --> 09:22:55,540
He was treating me a lot stronger than I actually was, and I hurt my back.

7262
09:22:55,540 --> 09:22:59,540
And now I can't, like, arch my back.

7263
09:22:59,540 --> 09:23:05,540
Oh, shit, are we supposed to sneak past those guys? I wasn't paying attention.

7264
09:23:05,540 --> 09:23:08,540
Okay.

7265
09:23:08,540 --> 09:23:12,540
Okay, so imagine Mummy wraps her legs around your neck to play. Yeah, I could probably do that easy.

7266
09:23:12,540 --> 09:23:18,540
For some reason, my life completely unaffected, but my back and my shoulders and my arms...

7267
09:23:18,540 --> 09:23:24,540
You know how people can, like, touch their shoulders backwards?

7268
09:23:24,540 --> 09:23:34,540
One arm has way worse than the other, and I'm damaged.

7269
09:23:34,540 --> 09:23:37,540
I have something wrong with my shoulders as well.

7270
09:23:37,540 --> 09:23:44,540
I used to go for sports massages, and the wife, she was so lovely to me.

7271
09:23:44,540 --> 09:23:46,540
She used to compliment me. She was like, oh, you're so pale.

7272
09:23:46,540 --> 09:23:50,540
And I'm like, oh my god, stop.

7273
09:23:50,540 --> 09:23:56,540
She used to be like, oh, I want pale skin like yours, and I'm like, I don't go outside.

7274
09:23:56,540 --> 09:23:58,540
But she was lovely, honestly.

7275
09:23:58,540 --> 09:24:03,540
Sorry, I'm not paying attention too, because you're rambling about my fucking massages.

7276
09:24:03,540 --> 09:24:07,540
But when she gave me my massage, she was like, what's wrong with your shoulders?

7277
09:24:07,540 --> 09:24:11,540
What do you do? And I'm like, am I gamer?

7278
09:24:11,540 --> 09:24:15,540
And she was like, this? You do this to yourself, gay man?

7279
09:24:15,540 --> 09:24:22,540
And I think I, like, hold myself up weird or something, and I don't realize it.

7280
09:24:22,540 --> 09:24:27,540
I was gonna try and see if I could find a place to go for sports massages again,

7281
09:24:27,540 --> 09:24:32,540
but I'm really scared, because I saw a fucking...

7282
09:24:32,540 --> 09:24:35,540
Right, this sounds bizarre. I don't know if it's real or not.

7283
09:24:35,540 --> 09:24:40,540
But apparently a lot of, like, massage parlors have a hidden camera,

7284
09:24:40,540 --> 09:24:44,540
and they, like, sell the footage, and I don't know if I should believe it or not,

7285
09:24:44,540 --> 09:24:49,540
but I didn't want my fanny out there, like...

7286
09:24:49,540 --> 09:24:52,540
Like, if I'm putting it out there, the reflins get to see it first.

7287
09:24:52,540 --> 09:24:57,540
I said what I said.

7288
09:24:57,540 --> 09:24:59,540
I blew out my knees because of the worker.

7289
09:24:59,540 --> 09:25:02,540
Oh, no.

7290
09:25:02,540 --> 09:25:05,540
I'm sorry for you, but...

7291
09:25:05,540 --> 09:25:09,540
Wait, are we gonna... Am I not supposed to be this way?

7292
09:25:09,540 --> 09:25:12,540
Never thought about that. Yeah, like, apparently there's, like, a...

7293
09:25:12,540 --> 09:25:16,540
Whoa! Hold on.

7294
09:25:16,540 --> 09:25:19,540
Ah, I'm so skinny.

7295
09:25:19,540 --> 09:25:22,540
Right, where am I going? Oh, up the ladder, the ladder.

7296
09:25:22,540 --> 09:25:25,540
Of course, the ladder! You mean that really obvious thing right here, yeah.

7297
09:25:25,540 --> 09:25:27,540
That blends in.

7298
09:25:27,540 --> 09:25:29,540
Probably need to do shoulders.

7299
09:25:29,540 --> 09:25:33,540
Well, she, the lady that was helping me, she was like,

7300
09:25:33,540 --> 09:25:36,540
you need to rotate your... You know, there's, like...

7301
09:25:36,540 --> 09:25:39,540
Oh, I can't even do it right now. It hurts to much to think about it.

7302
09:25:39,540 --> 09:25:43,540
You know, if I pointed to this guy with my hand, like, my arm all the way up,

7303
09:25:43,540 --> 09:25:47,540
and then went in circles, I don't know what that particular thing is called,

7304
09:25:47,540 --> 09:25:50,540
but she was like, do that every single day, forward and backward,

7305
09:25:50,540 --> 09:25:53,540
because you're so fucked up, and I was like, oh, okay.

7306
09:25:53,540 --> 09:25:57,540
And did I do it? No. And now I'm, like, got even worse mobility.

7307
09:25:57,540 --> 09:26:00,540
I'm broken, okay, reflins, I'm broken.

7308
09:26:00,540 --> 09:26:05,540
A rotary cuff injury? No, like, it can be fixed.

7309
09:26:05,540 --> 09:26:08,540
Oh, I'll go this way. It can be fixed.

7310
09:26:08,540 --> 09:26:16,540
But the problem is I don't do anything to fix it, i.e. I don't go to a massage person.

7311
09:26:16,540 --> 09:26:20,540
A masseuse? A masseuse, massage person.

7312
09:26:20,540 --> 09:26:23,540
I mean, it's not wrong, but...

7313
09:26:23,540 --> 09:26:27,540
It is a person who... Whoa! Rebling!

7314
09:26:27,540 --> 09:26:31,540
Are you dead?

7315
09:26:31,540 --> 09:26:33,540
Where did you go?

7316
09:26:33,540 --> 09:26:36,540
Am I going crazy?

7317
09:26:36,540 --> 09:26:40,540
Did he not go in there?

7318
09:26:40,540 --> 09:26:42,540
Hydration check.

7319
09:26:42,540 --> 09:26:44,540
Oh, now you're right.

7320
09:26:44,540 --> 09:26:50,540
Hold on, one hydration, please.

7321
09:26:50,540 --> 09:26:55,540
Damn. Where's these massage parlours so I can avoid them?

7322
09:26:55,540 --> 09:27:00,540
Did I tell you she almost touched my fanny in one of the massages? I was like, oh yeah.

7323
09:27:00,540 --> 09:27:07,540
So I left my wee boxers on, and...

7324
09:27:07,540 --> 09:27:14,540
So in order to do your gluteus maximus, your butt muscles,

7325
09:27:14,540 --> 09:27:21,540
they have to pull down your wee boxers and mat, but then they also go around your thighs as well.

7326
09:27:21,540 --> 09:27:25,540
And I was like, are you aiming for this? What's going on here?

7327
09:27:25,540 --> 09:27:28,540
I did not tip you the extra five. What's going on here?

7328
09:27:28,540 --> 09:27:31,540
What's the problem?

7329
09:27:31,540 --> 09:27:33,540
Where am I going?

7330
09:27:33,540 --> 09:27:39,540
Sorry, I can hardly string a sentence together right now.

7331
09:27:39,540 --> 09:27:47,540
I wanted to do a roleplay like that as well, where I was your inappropriate masseuse person.

7332
09:27:47,540 --> 09:27:49,540
Wait, did I not make that? Am I going crazy?

7333
09:27:49,540 --> 09:27:51,540
Hold on a minute.

7334
09:27:51,540 --> 09:27:57,540
I'm getting a memory. Did I not write that?

7335
09:27:57,540 --> 09:28:00,540
Where are we going?

7336
09:28:00,540 --> 09:28:06,540
I'm following you. Are you as lost as me right now?

7337
09:28:06,540 --> 09:28:10,540
Okay. I'm following you.

7338
09:28:10,540 --> 09:28:13,540
Wait, we've been here.

7339
09:28:13,540 --> 09:28:16,540
Quick hand from Johnny.

7340
09:28:16,540 --> 09:28:19,540
A happy ending. Yeah, I could have sworn I wrote a happy ending.

7341
09:28:19,540 --> 09:28:22,540
Did I write it for one of the girls recently?

7342
09:28:22,540 --> 09:28:29,540
Yeah, now that the script is back, maybe I wrote it only for me.

7343
09:28:29,540 --> 09:28:39,540
I'm thinking.

7344
09:28:39,540 --> 09:28:44,540
Maybe I started writing it for me. I don't recall giving it to any of the girls.

7345
09:28:44,540 --> 09:28:54,540
Like, anyone's more lovey-dovey stuff, so I wrote that.

7346
09:28:54,540 --> 09:29:01,540
I mean, I wrote a maidscript for AC, but that doesn't sound like anything like that.

7347
09:29:01,540 --> 09:29:06,540
Maybe I did write one.

7348
09:29:06,540 --> 09:29:10,540
Did something have a massage element in it, maybe?

7349
09:29:10,540 --> 09:29:13,540
Oh, okay, okay.

7350
09:29:13,540 --> 09:29:18,540
Thank you, Reflinks, for leading me.

7351
09:29:18,540 --> 09:29:23,540
Why poison yourself? What are you eating? That's poison anyway.

7352
09:29:23,540 --> 09:29:28,540
Oh, jeez. Okay, okay, I see who it is.

7353
09:29:28,540 --> 09:29:34,540
I wonder if there's any Reflinks to spawn.

7354
09:29:34,540 --> 09:29:37,540
Did you include silly comments in the script too?

7355
09:29:37,540 --> 09:29:40,540
I feel like I made a meme script, but I can't even recall nothing.

7356
09:29:40,540 --> 09:29:42,540
None of the details or anything.

7357
09:29:42,540 --> 09:29:47,540
God, there's so much blood here! What the fuck is ahead? The Giants!

7358
09:29:47,540 --> 09:29:51,540
Why is there so much blue?

7359
09:29:51,540 --> 09:29:54,540
Okay, right. What are we looking at?

7360
09:29:54,540 --> 09:29:57,540
Okay.

7361
09:29:57,540 --> 09:30:02,540
Uh, Gary, he's not been in any of these.

7362
09:30:02,540 --> 09:30:04,540
Oh, that's not red.

7363
09:30:04,540 --> 09:30:10,540
That is red, get? I read the else.

7364
09:30:10,540 --> 09:30:15,540
Mm-hmm.

7365
09:30:15,540 --> 09:30:18,540
And one.

7366
09:30:18,540 --> 09:30:20,540
Why?

7367
09:30:20,540 --> 09:30:24,540
And then, here's my evil Reflinks real question.

7368
09:30:24,540 --> 09:30:26,540
Cat top season.

7369
09:30:26,540 --> 09:30:29,540
No, what? Oh, right, because there's blood everywhere.

7370
09:30:29,540 --> 09:30:31,540
I'm already off it, what the fuck?

7371
09:30:31,540 --> 09:30:34,540
I was like, that's why ovulation's coming up.

7372
09:30:34,540 --> 09:30:37,540
Because after the sea of red, it goes good.

7373
09:30:37,540 --> 09:30:39,540
Who is my last evil?

7374
09:30:39,540 --> 09:30:44,540
Midra's Disciple? I've not had you.

7375
09:30:44,540 --> 09:30:48,540
Hi.

7376
09:30:48,540 --> 09:30:52,540
Mm-hmm.

7377
09:30:53,540 --> 09:30:55,540
She's still going. You can't stop me.

7378
09:30:55,540 --> 09:30:59,540
As soon as it comes, the endurance goes up even further.

7379
09:30:59,540 --> 09:31:02,540
As soon as it comes to when you guys have the ability to play with me,

7380
09:31:02,540 --> 09:31:04,540
you should see my piece of paper.

7381
09:31:04,540 --> 09:31:06,540
Actually, I'll need to take out a ton of...

7382
09:31:06,540 --> 09:31:09,540
I need to put my papers together.

7383
09:31:09,540 --> 09:31:12,540
Mm-hmm.

7384
09:31:12,540 --> 09:31:14,540
Hey.

7385
09:31:14,540 --> 09:31:17,540
I wish this game had CrossFit. I'm so sorry.

7386
09:31:17,540 --> 09:31:19,540
I promise, I promise.

7387
09:31:19,540 --> 09:31:21,540
Hopefully, games that have more CrossFit, I promise, I promise.

7388
09:31:21,540 --> 09:31:24,540
I can see your butt line. What's going on here?

7389
09:31:24,540 --> 09:31:27,540
Okay, where are we going?

7390
09:31:27,540 --> 09:31:30,540
Come.

7391
09:31:30,540 --> 09:31:32,540
Let's go together.

7392
09:31:32,540 --> 09:31:35,540
Show me the way.

7393
09:31:35,540 --> 09:31:39,540
Okay, let's be gentle.

7394
09:31:39,540 --> 09:31:42,540
Be gentle with me.

7395
09:31:42,540 --> 09:31:44,540
Mm-hmm, that stopped all.

7396
09:31:44,540 --> 09:31:47,540
I, A, I technically stopped to pee and eat.

7397
09:31:47,540 --> 09:31:50,540
But unfortunately, I'm getting close to the VOD limit,

7398
09:31:50,540 --> 09:31:53,540
which is making me nervous. I hear that.

7399
09:31:53,540 --> 09:31:56,540
Come on, YouTube. Update so there's no VOD limit,

7400
09:31:56,540 --> 09:31:59,540
so I can do a 24-hour stream for the YOLO.

7401
09:31:59,540 --> 09:32:02,540
Come on.

7402
09:32:07,540 --> 09:32:10,540
Monster Hunter better have CrossFit. I've got a boner for it.

7403
09:32:10,540 --> 09:32:13,540
What?!

7404
09:32:13,540 --> 09:32:16,540
Honestly, me.

7405
09:32:16,540 --> 09:32:19,540
Mm-hmm.

7406
09:32:22,540 --> 09:32:25,540
Okay. Oh, I got a somber smithing stone.

7407
09:32:25,540 --> 09:32:27,540
Not bad.

7408
09:32:27,540 --> 09:32:30,540
You've still got 2.5 hours to go.

7409
09:32:30,540 --> 09:32:32,540
But it's not enough, is it?

7410
09:32:32,540 --> 09:32:34,540
It's not enough refund time.

7411
09:32:34,540 --> 09:32:38,540
Oh, I'll say my voice is really starting to hurt to talk

7412
09:32:38,540 --> 09:32:42,540
and I feel really bad because I don't want to, like, stop talking.

7413
09:32:42,540 --> 09:32:45,540
Oh, there's an item back here.

7414
09:32:45,540 --> 09:32:48,540
Do excuse me. I'll pick this bad boy up.

7415
09:32:48,540 --> 09:32:50,540
Please be a smithing stone.

7416
09:32:50,540 --> 09:32:52,540
I did.

7417
09:32:52,540 --> 09:32:54,540
Another one.

7418
09:32:54,540 --> 09:32:56,540
Another one.

7419
09:32:56,540 --> 09:32:58,540
I need vocal rest. I do.

7420
09:32:58,540 --> 09:33:01,540
I do actually need vocal rest.

7421
09:33:01,540 --> 09:33:04,540
Oh, god, the giants are fighting.

7422
09:33:04,540 --> 09:33:06,540
Do we just ignore the giants?

7423
09:33:06,540 --> 09:33:08,540
I'm gonna ignore them, okay?

7424
09:33:08,540 --> 09:33:11,540
Just let them fight, okay?

7425
09:33:11,540 --> 09:33:13,540
That's not mommy's problem.

7426
09:33:13,540 --> 09:33:15,540
That's not mommy and reflin's problem.

7427
09:33:15,540 --> 09:33:18,540
What they do on their time off is nothing to do with what I thought it would be.

7428
09:33:18,540 --> 09:33:22,540
Is this the one where there's a fight and it's the guy's blade or something?

7429
09:33:22,540 --> 09:33:25,540
I remember you giving me a blood blade here.

7430
09:33:25,540 --> 09:33:29,540
Whether or not there was this life or another.

7431
09:33:29,540 --> 09:33:32,540
Okay, it's safe, it's safe.

7432
09:33:32,540 --> 09:33:35,540
Church of repos.

7433
09:33:35,540 --> 09:33:37,540
That's where the reflin's at.

7434
09:33:37,540 --> 09:33:40,540
I'm like, Pokemon? Ah, that's what I've been doing.

7435
09:33:40,540 --> 09:33:42,540
I just need to ignore.

7436
09:33:42,540 --> 09:33:44,540
Okay, absolutely good to hear.

7437
09:33:44,540 --> 09:33:46,540
Let's go.

7438
09:33:46,540 --> 09:33:48,540
Hey!

7439
09:33:48,540 --> 09:33:50,540
Sorry.

7440
09:33:50,540 --> 09:33:52,540
Yes, I am.

7441
09:33:52,540 --> 09:33:54,540
I've been up since midnight. Be nice.

7442
09:33:54,540 --> 09:33:56,540
Becaine!

7443
09:33:56,540 --> 09:34:00,540
It's technically my bedtime and I kid you not to.

7444
09:34:00,540 --> 09:34:03,540
I'm gonna be streaming it in my bedtime.

7445
09:34:03,540 --> 09:34:05,540
Where the fuck did you go?

7446
09:34:05,540 --> 09:34:07,540
Dude!

7447
09:34:07,540 --> 09:34:11,540
Yeah, I swear you guys just disappear right in front of me.

7448
09:34:11,540 --> 09:34:14,540
Up the rock?

7449
09:34:14,540 --> 09:34:16,540
Oh, careful!

7450
09:34:16,540 --> 09:34:18,540
I'm to go up the rock?

7451
09:34:18,540 --> 09:34:21,540
Or is this not the correct rock?

7452
09:34:21,540 --> 09:34:27,540
If you think you are graduating Elton Ring without kissing my cock, you are dead wrong.

7453
09:34:27,540 --> 09:34:31,540
Well, you've been at this since 2 p.m. my time and it's 2 a.m.

7454
09:34:31,540 --> 09:34:33,540
Yours, I believe.

7455
09:34:33,540 --> 09:34:35,540
It's 1 p.m. for me.

7456
09:34:35,540 --> 09:34:37,540
I'm in Australia, can't...

7457
09:34:37,540 --> 09:34:39,540
Ha ha ha!

7458
09:34:39,540 --> 09:34:41,540
Oh, something's going for us.

7459
09:34:41,540 --> 09:34:43,540
Oh yeah!

7460
09:34:43,540 --> 09:34:45,540
No!

7461
09:34:45,540 --> 09:34:49,540
There will be no avian vichabers!

7462
09:34:49,540 --> 09:34:53,540
They're acting like this on the side.

7463
09:34:53,540 --> 09:34:55,540
Hi, how you doing?

7464
09:34:55,540 --> 09:34:57,540
Straight to my...

7465
09:34:57,540 --> 09:34:59,540
Real Andrew.

7466
09:34:59,540 --> 09:35:01,540
Your bedtime is 3 p.m.?

7467
09:35:01,540 --> 09:35:07,540
I wake up at midnight, so if I record ASMR for example, it's quiet.

7468
09:35:07,540 --> 09:35:11,540
Well, for the most part, there's not going to be any cars that would interrupt me.

7469
09:35:11,540 --> 09:35:17,540
But when has that ever stopped a car interrupting me or a plane going overhead or this or X or Y or Z or P?

7470
09:35:17,540 --> 09:35:19,540
No crow vichabers!

7471
09:35:23,540 --> 09:35:25,540
I'll go to this grey site down here.

7472
09:35:31,540 --> 09:35:33,540
I don't know if you survive or I'll survive.

7473
09:35:39,540 --> 09:35:43,540
Your sleep schedule is just foobar?

7474
09:35:43,540 --> 09:35:45,540
Isn't that strong enough?

7475
09:35:45,540 --> 09:35:47,540
What does foobar mean?

7476
09:35:47,540 --> 09:35:49,540
Gigi.

7477
09:35:49,540 --> 09:35:51,540
I don't know this word.

7478
09:35:53,540 --> 09:35:57,540
It's 11 p.m. for me, but screw sleep, mommy's streaming.

7479
09:35:57,540 --> 09:35:59,540
No! Go sleep if you need to sleep.

7480
09:36:01,540 --> 09:36:05,540
No slimes, no avians, you're just the one's to have fun!

7481
09:36:05,540 --> 09:36:07,540
I bring you the fur-

7482
09:36:07,540 --> 09:36:13,540
Actually, no, I'm sure there's been another YouTuber out of the McDonald's Happy Meal variety before.

7483
09:36:13,540 --> 09:36:15,540
Foobar?

7484
09:36:15,540 --> 09:36:17,540
Fucked up beyond repair.

7485
09:36:17,540 --> 09:36:19,540
Oh!

7486
09:36:19,540 --> 09:36:21,540
That's what foobar means?

7487
09:36:25,540 --> 09:36:27,540
F'd up beyond all repair.

7488
09:36:31,540 --> 09:36:33,540
Have I gone the wrong way?

7489
09:36:33,540 --> 09:36:35,540
What are you hearing at?

7490
09:36:35,540 --> 09:36:37,540
Eh, Macarena.

7491
09:36:39,540 --> 09:36:41,540
I didn't vanquish it!

7492
09:36:43,540 --> 09:36:45,540
Oh god, is this a fight?

7493
09:36:45,540 --> 09:36:47,540
Okay.

7494
09:36:47,540 --> 09:36:51,540
Situations all, normally all left up.

7495
09:36:51,540 --> 09:36:53,540
Snafu.

7496
09:36:53,540 --> 09:36:55,540
There he is!

7497
09:36:55,540 --> 09:36:57,540
Damn, I didn't get the cutscene.

7498
09:36:57,540 --> 09:36:59,540
Cutscene?

7499
09:36:59,540 --> 09:37:01,540
Is he not a cutscene boss?

7500
09:37:01,540 --> 09:37:03,540
Can I go on my horse?

7501
09:37:03,540 --> 09:37:05,540
Am I reeflings here?

7502
09:37:05,540 --> 09:37:07,540
Hey reeflings, are you still here by a chunk?

7503
09:37:07,540 --> 09:37:09,540
Hey reeflings, you wanna come help?

7504
09:37:09,540 --> 09:37:11,540
Reefling, reefling, reefling.

7505
09:37:13,540 --> 09:37:15,540
I'm scared.

7506
09:37:15,540 --> 09:37:17,540
What does this attack?

7507
09:37:21,540 --> 09:37:23,540
He really said deforestation, that's my attack.

7508
09:37:23,540 --> 09:37:25,540
Okay.

7509
09:37:25,540 --> 09:37:27,540
How'd I deal with him?

7510
09:37:29,540 --> 09:37:31,540
Cutscenes only if he survived a phase two.

7511
09:37:35,540 --> 09:37:37,540
Is that my lightning?

7512
09:37:45,540 --> 09:37:47,540
Oh yeah, you have to go for his gammy leg.

7513
09:37:47,540 --> 09:37:49,540
I'm disgusting.

7514
09:37:55,540 --> 09:37:57,540
If I can even get close enough to his leg.

7515
09:37:57,540 --> 09:37:59,540
Oh he's AI'd to me.

7516
09:37:59,540 --> 09:38:01,540
Go away AI, you stink.

7517
09:38:03,540 --> 09:38:05,540
I fucking rolled right into that.

7518
09:38:05,540 --> 09:38:07,540
That's hilarious.

7519
09:38:09,540 --> 09:38:11,540
Oh my god, one beat his foot up.

7520
09:38:17,540 --> 09:38:19,540
He left his bone behind.

7521
09:38:19,540 --> 09:38:21,540
And his wee dreadlocks.

7522
09:38:25,540 --> 09:38:27,540
Oh my god.

7523
09:38:31,540 --> 09:38:33,540
How do you know?

7524
09:38:33,540 --> 09:38:35,540
It's so hard.

7525
09:38:35,540 --> 09:38:37,540
Whose gameplay is this?

7526
09:38:37,540 --> 09:38:39,540
It's shit, honestly.

7527
09:38:39,540 --> 09:38:41,540
I'll go for his other foot.

7528
09:38:41,540 --> 09:38:43,540
I'm helping, okay.

7529
09:38:43,540 --> 09:38:45,540
I'll just go for the other foot.

7530
09:38:47,540 --> 09:38:49,540
Oh you did it!

7531
09:38:49,540 --> 09:38:51,540
Oh my god.

7532
09:38:53,540 --> 09:38:55,540
Scotland forever.

7533
09:38:55,540 --> 09:38:57,540
Oh I hate that, I forgot about that.

7534
09:38:57,540 --> 09:38:59,540
I forgot about that.

7535
09:38:59,540 --> 09:39:01,540
I'll give you that, you win this one.

7536
09:39:07,540 --> 09:39:09,540
Oh my god.

7537
09:39:09,540 --> 09:39:11,540
Oh don't touch it, just leave it.

7538
09:39:19,540 --> 09:39:21,540
Oh my god.

7539
09:39:31,540 --> 09:39:33,540
Will I ever do a react Andy scene?

7540
09:39:33,540 --> 09:39:37,540
Maybe to the Sonic Heroes dub thing in my ballpark.

7541
09:39:37,540 --> 09:39:39,540
I got quite a few requests for that.

7542
09:39:39,540 --> 09:39:41,540
P.O.B. picking up hot food.

7543
09:39:51,540 --> 09:39:53,540
I thought he was going to fix it there.

7544
09:39:53,540 --> 09:39:55,540
Oh my god.

7545
09:39:55,540 --> 09:39:59,540
I forgot how terrifying he is in this form.

7546
09:40:03,540 --> 09:40:05,540
I'm helping, I promise.

7547
09:40:09,540 --> 09:40:11,540
Oh.

7548
09:40:11,540 --> 09:40:13,540
Don't mind me getting a few telewax.

7549
09:40:13,540 --> 09:40:15,540
Don't mind me at all son.

7550
09:40:15,540 --> 09:40:17,540
What did he mind me?

7551
09:40:21,540 --> 09:40:23,540
I'll go for his thigh, okay.

7552
09:40:23,540 --> 09:40:25,540
There we go.

7553
09:40:25,540 --> 09:40:27,540
Teamwork makes the dream work.

7554
09:40:29,540 --> 09:40:31,540
I helped, I totally helped.

7555
09:40:33,540 --> 09:40:35,540
I got an achievement.

7556
09:40:35,540 --> 09:40:37,540
Defeat the fire giant.

7557
09:40:37,540 --> 09:40:41,540
Right, so I don't want to burn my maid, okay.

7558
09:40:41,540 --> 09:40:45,540
How did you, what are you doing to make yourself explode?

7559
09:40:47,540 --> 09:40:49,540
Okay, I don't want to hurt my maiden.

7560
09:40:49,540 --> 09:40:53,540
So now where do I go to get the frenzied flame?

7561
09:40:55,540 --> 09:40:57,540
Mummy and Wiefling.

7562
09:40:57,540 --> 09:40:59,540
Just completely the one in the boss which was that mummy's the Elden Lord.

7563
09:40:59,540 --> 09:41:03,540
Need to go back to Light and Dell.

7564
09:41:03,540 --> 09:41:05,540
Go deep into the sewers.

7565
09:41:05,540 --> 09:41:07,540
Light and Dell.

7566
09:41:07,540 --> 09:41:09,540
Light and Dell.

7567
09:41:09,540 --> 09:41:11,540
Oh god, this fucking creepy place that I hate.

7568
09:41:13,540 --> 09:41:15,540
Light and Dell, Avenue Balcony?

7569
09:41:17,540 --> 09:41:19,540
Avenue Balcony is the place you want for the sewers, okay.

7570
09:41:19,540 --> 09:41:21,540
Please tell me I can spawn you then.

7571
09:41:23,540 --> 09:41:25,540
I know where to start.

7572
09:41:25,540 --> 09:41:27,540
I can't spawn you then.

7573
09:41:27,540 --> 09:41:29,540
Cause I've already done, I'm like 9% sure I can spawn your asses in.

7574
09:41:31,540 --> 09:41:33,540
Not only have an enemy gate, okay.

7575
09:41:35,540 --> 09:41:37,540
I hope you're ready to run fast to the sewers.

7576
09:41:39,540 --> 09:41:41,540
I'm going to be sewer sliding.

7577
09:41:47,540 --> 09:41:49,540
Take me to the sewer shittling.

7578
09:41:51,540 --> 09:41:53,540
No, that was me.

7579
09:41:53,540 --> 09:41:55,540
I didn't mean about you.

7580
09:41:55,540 --> 09:41:57,540
I promise I did.

7581
09:41:57,540 --> 09:41:59,540
My brain was like ha ha sewer and ling and my brain said shittling.

7582
09:41:59,540 --> 09:42:01,540
I'm sorry.

7583
09:42:01,540 --> 09:42:03,540
I have a dry arm but we'll be close.

7584
09:42:03,540 --> 09:42:05,540
Oh, it's deodorant.

7585
09:42:07,540 --> 09:42:09,540
So did I put deodorant on or not?

7586
09:42:09,540 --> 09:42:11,540
I can't remember.

7587
09:42:11,540 --> 09:42:13,540
Yeah, I must have put deodorant on.

7588
09:42:13,540 --> 09:42:15,540
Okay, I'm ready. Sorry.

7589
09:42:15,540 --> 09:42:17,540
I was inspecting my arm put.

7590
09:42:17,540 --> 09:42:19,540
I was inspect elementing my arm put.

7591
09:42:19,540 --> 09:42:21,540
Okay, sewers, sewers.

7592
09:42:21,540 --> 09:42:23,540
Easy.

7593
09:42:23,540 --> 09:42:25,540
Take it easy.

7594
09:42:25,540 --> 09:42:27,540
Okay.

7595
09:42:27,540 --> 09:42:29,540
Uh huh.

7596
09:42:29,540 --> 09:42:31,540
Yes.

7597
09:42:31,540 --> 09:42:33,540
Faster. Here.

7598
09:42:33,540 --> 09:42:35,540
I'm off. I'm away.

7599
09:42:35,540 --> 09:42:37,540
You don't have to tell me twice.

7600
09:42:37,540 --> 09:42:39,540
Okay.

7601
09:42:39,540 --> 09:42:41,540
What's going on here? Open.

7602
09:42:41,540 --> 09:42:43,540
Open.

7603
09:42:43,540 --> 09:42:45,540
Open sesame.

7604
09:42:45,540 --> 09:42:47,540
Open sesame toast.

7605
09:42:47,540 --> 09:42:49,540
Hold on. I'm going to grab that.

7606
09:42:49,540 --> 09:42:51,540
I am real quick.

7607
09:42:51,540 --> 09:42:53,540
I think it's going to get me jumped.

7608
09:42:53,540 --> 09:42:55,540
Something's trying.

7609
09:42:55,540 --> 09:42:57,540
Okay, easy.

7610
09:42:57,540 --> 09:42:59,540
Easy.

7611
09:42:59,540 --> 09:43:01,540
Okay, where is it?

7612
09:43:01,540 --> 09:43:03,540
Where did you? You're so quick.

7613
09:43:03,540 --> 09:43:05,540
You're too fast for mommy.

7614
09:43:05,540 --> 09:43:07,540
Mommy can't keep up with your pace.

7615
09:43:07,540 --> 09:43:09,540
Please slow down.

7616
09:43:09,540 --> 09:43:11,540
You're too enthusiastic, little rooflin.

7617
09:43:13,540 --> 09:43:15,540
Oh, I spoke too soon.

7618
09:43:15,540 --> 09:43:17,540
Okay, I'm sorry.

7619
09:43:17,540 --> 09:43:19,540
You must be able to see that as well.

7620
09:43:19,540 --> 09:43:21,540
Right.

7621
09:43:21,540 --> 09:43:23,540
Let's put this light on.

7622
09:43:23,540 --> 09:43:25,540
What's the situation?

7623
09:43:25,540 --> 09:43:27,540
What's the situation?

7624
09:43:27,540 --> 09:43:29,540
There's definitely stuff down there.

7625
09:43:29,540 --> 09:43:31,540
What are they?

7626
09:43:31,540 --> 09:43:33,540
Can I tingling?

7627
09:43:33,540 --> 09:43:35,540
No, I can't tingling here.

7628
09:43:35,540 --> 09:43:37,540
Um...

7629
09:43:37,540 --> 09:43:39,540
Hmm.

7630
09:43:39,540 --> 09:43:41,540
Do I just run?

7631
09:43:43,540 --> 09:43:45,540
Like a damn jackhammer.

7632
09:43:49,540 --> 09:43:51,540
Okay, well I missed that item, but it's not big deal.

7633
09:43:51,540 --> 09:43:53,540
Please open faster.

7634
09:43:57,540 --> 09:43:59,540
Oh my god.

7635
09:43:59,540 --> 09:44:01,540
I kind of remember.

7636
09:44:01,540 --> 09:44:03,540
I'm having a memory.

7637
09:44:03,540 --> 09:44:05,540
There's a big enemy here, but there's a room here somewhere.

7638
09:44:05,540 --> 09:44:07,540
I'm having a memory.

7639
09:44:07,540 --> 09:44:09,540
Oh my god, room.

7640
09:44:09,540 --> 09:44:11,540
Get the rooflins in.

7641
09:44:11,540 --> 09:44:13,540
Send me down, send me down, send me down to reset that enemy.

7642
09:44:13,540 --> 09:44:15,540
So he's not freaking locked onto me.

7643
09:44:15,540 --> 09:44:17,540
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

7644
09:44:17,540 --> 09:44:19,540
Okay.

7645
09:44:19,540 --> 09:44:21,540
Okay, I'm sat.

7646
09:44:21,540 --> 09:44:23,540
I'm sat.

7647
09:44:23,540 --> 09:44:25,540
I'm sat.

7648
09:44:25,540 --> 09:44:27,540
Don't have to tell me twice.

7649
09:44:27,540 --> 09:44:29,540
I have sat down to reset that enemy.

7650
09:44:29,540 --> 09:44:31,540
Okay, who's not had a chance?

7651
09:44:31,540 --> 09:44:33,540
You are my enemy guide.

7652
09:44:33,540 --> 09:44:35,540
Not Alessandra, you don't have a chance.

7653
09:44:35,540 --> 09:44:37,540
Okay, don't ever do it.

7654
09:44:37,540 --> 09:44:39,540
Have a damn heart attack in this game.

7655
09:44:39,540 --> 09:44:41,540
I think Azura is playing dead space as well.

7656
09:44:41,540 --> 09:44:43,540
I don't know how she's not going to have a heart attack.

7657
09:44:43,540 --> 09:44:45,540
Can we have a heart attack in a while?

7658
09:44:45,540 --> 09:44:47,540
Have you had a heart attack in a while?

7659
09:44:47,540 --> 09:44:49,540
I mean, nice.

7660
09:44:49,540 --> 09:44:51,540
You were in...

7661
09:44:51,540 --> 09:44:53,540
You were in a different column.

7662
09:44:53,540 --> 09:44:55,540
That's how long ago it was you played.

7663
09:44:55,540 --> 09:44:57,540
Jal da beos.

7664
09:44:57,540 --> 09:44:59,540
I'm not actually...

7665
09:44:59,540 --> 09:45:01,540
Jal da.

7666
09:45:01,540 --> 09:45:03,540
Big Jal da.

7667
09:45:03,540 --> 09:45:05,540
Big Jal da boss.

7668
09:45:05,540 --> 09:45:07,540
You sound like a planet like Tatooine.

7669
09:45:07,540 --> 09:45:09,540
Or like the other planets that I've already forgotten.

7670
09:45:15,540 --> 09:45:17,540
Oh.

7671
09:45:17,540 --> 09:45:19,540
An Overlord Reference?

7672
09:45:19,540 --> 09:45:21,540
Oh, I don't know that one.

7673
09:45:21,540 --> 09:45:23,540
Sorry, I'm hydrating.

7674
09:45:23,540 --> 09:45:25,540
I'm making sure I hydrate.

7675
09:45:25,540 --> 09:45:27,540
I want no more donals telling me to hydrate.

7676
09:45:27,540 --> 09:45:29,540
I'm hydrating, okay?

7677
09:45:29,540 --> 09:45:31,540
You don't have to give me money to hydrate.

7678
09:45:31,540 --> 09:45:33,540
You can just type Hydration Check, mom.

7679
09:45:33,540 --> 09:45:35,540
Okay.

7680
09:45:35,540 --> 09:45:37,540
Right, are you ready?

7681
09:45:37,540 --> 09:45:39,540
I'm ready.

7682
09:45:39,540 --> 09:45:41,540
I'm ready.

7683
09:45:41,540 --> 09:45:43,540
I'm ready.

7684
09:45:43,540 --> 09:45:45,540
Right, are you ready?

7685
09:45:47,540 --> 09:45:49,540
So there's that fight with this guy.

7686
09:45:49,540 --> 09:45:51,540
There's two of them here.

7687
09:45:51,540 --> 09:45:53,540
Yeah, one there and one...

7688
09:45:53,540 --> 09:45:55,540
Oh god, there's three of them.

7689
09:45:55,540 --> 09:45:57,540
What the fuck, I don't even remember that much.

7690
09:45:57,540 --> 09:45:59,540
Okay, let's beat them up.

7691
09:45:59,540 --> 09:46:01,540
They weren't...

7692
09:46:01,540 --> 09:46:03,540
They were just intimidating.

7693
09:46:03,540 --> 09:46:05,540
I remember being really intimidated.

7694
09:46:05,540 --> 09:46:07,540
Right, okay.

7695
09:46:07,540 --> 09:46:09,540
I fucking love refunds.

7696
09:46:09,540 --> 09:46:11,540
Sorry, but...

7697
09:46:11,540 --> 09:46:13,540
It actually makes game accessible.

7698
09:46:13,540 --> 09:46:15,540
What more can I ask for?

7699
09:46:15,540 --> 09:46:17,540
What more can I ask for?

7700
09:46:17,540 --> 09:46:19,540
I get to have experience for the first time with you.

7701
09:46:19,540 --> 09:46:21,540
I get to have experience for the first time with you.

7702
09:46:23,540 --> 09:46:25,540
Okay, right.

7703
09:46:25,540 --> 09:46:27,540
I hope you see...

7704
09:46:27,540 --> 09:46:29,540
Okay, rats in here.

7705
09:46:29,540 --> 09:46:31,540
I remember the Suraphybes.

7706
09:46:31,540 --> 09:46:33,540
I will clear it, fuck it, we'll clear it.

7707
09:46:35,540 --> 09:46:37,540
Just so we're not getting jumped from behind, you know?

7708
09:46:37,540 --> 09:46:39,540
Just so we're not getting jumped from behind, you know?

7709
09:46:39,540 --> 09:46:41,540
Okay.

7710
09:46:41,540 --> 09:46:43,540
And then we need to find the frenzy.

7711
09:46:43,540 --> 09:46:45,540
Whoa, what the fuck?

7712
09:46:47,540 --> 09:46:49,540
Oh, refund, I'm sorry!

7713
09:46:51,540 --> 09:46:53,540
I think I almost killed you there.

7714
09:46:53,540 --> 09:46:55,540
Sorry, Dolphys.

7715
09:46:55,540 --> 09:46:57,540
Oh shit, I'm sorry, I fell down.

7716
09:46:57,540 --> 09:46:59,540
I don't think I was supposed to go down.

7717
09:46:59,540 --> 09:47:01,540
Sorry.

7718
09:47:01,540 --> 09:47:03,540
Tee hee.

7719
09:47:03,540 --> 09:47:05,540
Tee hee.

7720
09:47:07,540 --> 09:47:09,540
Uh...

7721
09:47:11,540 --> 09:47:13,540
Yeah, I was just going to be up the basilisk.

7722
09:47:15,540 --> 09:47:17,540
Oh no, those aren't basilisk.

7723
09:47:17,540 --> 09:47:19,540
Those are just weirdos in the dark.

7724
09:47:19,540 --> 09:47:21,540
Oh my god, they're just ghosts.

7725
09:47:21,540 --> 09:47:23,540
Let me open this.

7726
09:47:23,540 --> 09:47:25,540
Sorry, sorry.

7727
09:47:25,540 --> 09:47:27,540
We are...

7728
09:47:27,540 --> 09:47:29,540
Batang!

7729
09:47:29,540 --> 09:47:31,540
Get the poopy ones.

7730
09:47:35,540 --> 09:47:37,540
Are they all poopy ones?

7731
09:47:41,540 --> 09:47:43,540
There.

7732
09:47:43,540 --> 09:47:45,540
They drop...

7733
09:47:45,540 --> 09:47:47,540
Flash? Why would they drop flash?

7734
09:47:49,540 --> 09:47:53,540
Trying to get another streamer friend through this labyrinth who was playing without any co-op.

7735
09:47:53,540 --> 09:47:55,540
Someone's was a nightmare.

7736
09:47:59,540 --> 09:48:01,540
Hmm...

7737
09:48:05,540 --> 09:48:07,540
Seems like there's a bit of a lag delay.

7738
09:48:09,540 --> 09:48:11,540
Okay, I'm following torch.

7739
09:48:11,540 --> 09:48:13,540
Jump.

7740
09:48:13,540 --> 09:48:15,540
That refund fell!

7741
09:48:15,540 --> 09:48:17,540
Wait, was that supposed to fall?

7742
09:48:17,540 --> 09:48:19,540
Or did I wait here for them to come around again?

7743
09:48:23,540 --> 09:48:25,540
Wait, how do I know if I'm supposed to jump or not?

7744
09:48:25,540 --> 09:48:27,540
Am I supposed to jump or not?

7745
09:48:27,540 --> 09:48:29,540
Come down?

7746
09:48:29,540 --> 09:48:31,540
Ah, fuck it, I'll come down.

7747
09:48:33,540 --> 09:48:35,540
We'll look at...

7748
09:48:35,540 --> 09:48:37,540
I'm following...

7749
09:48:37,540 --> 09:48:39,540
Oh, okay, well...

7750
09:48:39,540 --> 09:48:41,540
Nine hours of Elden Ring cover for...

7751
09:48:43,540 --> 09:48:45,540
I only have this endurance when it's a stream-snap game.

7752
09:48:47,540 --> 09:48:49,540
I get a lot of...

7753
09:48:51,540 --> 09:48:53,540
What would you call it?

7754
09:48:53,540 --> 09:48:55,540
Energy?

7755
09:48:57,540 --> 09:48:59,540
Okay, I get like a lot of energy.

7756
09:49:01,540 --> 09:49:03,540
Enthusiasm?

7757
09:49:03,540 --> 09:49:05,540
I don't know about that word.

7758
09:49:11,540 --> 09:49:13,540
From...

7759
09:49:13,540 --> 09:49:15,540
Huh?

7760
09:49:15,540 --> 09:49:17,540
I think we're all getting a bit...

7761
09:49:17,540 --> 09:49:19,540
Oh!

7762
09:49:19,540 --> 09:49:21,540
Oh, well, this is somewhere new at least.

7763
09:49:23,540 --> 09:49:25,540
Uh...

7764
09:49:25,540 --> 09:49:27,540
Right.

7765
09:49:27,540 --> 09:49:29,540
There's a lot of things lurking around in the dark here.

7766
09:49:29,540 --> 09:49:31,540
Wow!

7767
09:49:33,540 --> 09:49:35,540
Hold on.

7768
09:49:35,540 --> 09:49:37,540
Motivation?

7769
09:49:37,540 --> 09:49:39,540
Yeah.

7770
09:49:39,540 --> 09:49:41,540
Oh, uh...

7771
09:49:41,540 --> 09:49:43,540
Well, that wasn't supposed to happen.

7772
09:49:43,540 --> 09:49:45,540
Oh dear.

7773
09:49:47,540 --> 09:49:49,540
Okay, well, I'm glad that's gone.

7774
09:49:49,540 --> 09:49:51,540
Um...

7775
09:49:53,540 --> 09:49:55,540
She's absorbing our energy.

7776
09:49:57,540 --> 09:49:59,540
So, Succubus is dealing Life Force, right?

7777
09:49:59,540 --> 09:50:01,540
Like...

7778
09:50:03,540 --> 09:50:05,540
Um...

7779
09:50:09,540 --> 09:50:11,540
I got the delay on those slugs registering their deaths.

7780
09:50:11,540 --> 09:50:13,540
This is pretty fucking wacky.

7781
09:50:15,540 --> 09:50:17,540
Um...

7782
09:50:17,540 --> 09:50:19,540
Succubus is like energy, right?

7783
09:50:19,540 --> 09:50:21,540
But it's only taken through ink.

7784
09:50:21,540 --> 09:50:23,540
Yes?

7785
09:50:23,540 --> 09:50:25,540
Ow!

7786
09:50:25,540 --> 09:50:27,540
The poofy slug got me.

7787
09:50:27,540 --> 09:50:29,540
Oh, there's an item here.

7788
09:50:29,540 --> 09:50:31,540
Yeah, they steal Life Force through the ink.

7789
09:50:31,540 --> 09:50:33,540
Okay.

7790
09:50:35,540 --> 09:50:37,540
So, I steal your energy being around you?

7791
09:50:39,540 --> 09:50:41,540
So, what does that mean?

7792
09:50:43,540 --> 09:50:45,540
What does that mean?

7793
09:50:45,540 --> 09:50:47,540
I don't know yet.

7794
09:50:47,540 --> 09:50:49,540
Oh!

7795
09:50:51,540 --> 09:50:53,540
What?

7796
09:50:57,540 --> 09:50:59,540
Do you need help?

7797
09:50:59,540 --> 09:51:01,540
No.

7798
09:51:01,540 --> 09:51:03,540
No, I need help, clearly.

7799
09:51:05,540 --> 09:51:07,540
Leave him alone!

7800
09:51:15,540 --> 09:51:17,540
We even won't ink for you at any time.

7801
09:51:17,540 --> 09:51:19,540
That's what I like to hear.

7802
09:51:19,540 --> 09:51:21,540
Okay, open door.

7803
09:51:21,540 --> 09:51:23,540
Open...

7804
09:51:25,540 --> 09:51:27,540
Because it's not open. Cumin.

7805
09:51:31,540 --> 09:51:33,540
Okay, and then...

7806
09:51:33,540 --> 09:51:35,540
Can I go...

7807
09:51:35,540 --> 09:51:37,540
Hey!

7808
09:51:37,540 --> 09:51:39,540
And then I open this lever to make a comeback faster.

7809
09:51:41,540 --> 09:51:43,540
Something, something off your mum's teeth.

7810
09:51:43,540 --> 09:51:45,540
And then...

7811
09:51:45,540 --> 09:51:47,540
A little to the right.

7812
09:51:49,540 --> 09:51:51,540
And then this is downwards to the frenzied flame.

7813
09:51:51,540 --> 09:51:53,540
Why would it be in the sewers?

7814
09:51:53,540 --> 09:51:55,540
That's so random.

7815
09:51:57,540 --> 09:51:59,540
I guess maybe they would want to hate it's existence.

7816
09:52:01,540 --> 09:52:03,540
They're like, ah, well, we made this.

7817
09:52:03,540 --> 09:52:05,540
Let's go.

7818
09:52:07,540 --> 09:52:09,540
Bro, die! Jeez, he's like infinite 18.

7819
09:52:09,540 --> 09:52:11,540
Infinite 18.

7820
09:52:11,540 --> 09:52:13,540
A grace mimic.

7821
09:52:13,540 --> 09:52:15,540
Curious.

7822
09:52:15,540 --> 09:52:17,540
How could you need that?

7823
09:52:17,540 --> 09:52:19,540
Like vampires are different variations of the lore.

7824
09:52:19,540 --> 09:52:21,540
Yeah, how they live changes on...

7825
09:52:21,540 --> 09:52:23,540
Where?

7826
09:52:23,540 --> 09:52:25,540
I'm on the wrong way.

7827
09:52:25,540 --> 09:52:27,540
What's going on?

7828
09:52:27,540 --> 09:52:29,540
Oh!

7829
09:52:33,540 --> 09:52:35,540
Oh, and I got a smith in stone.

7830
09:52:35,540 --> 09:52:37,540
I got a smith in stone.

7831
09:52:37,540 --> 09:52:39,540
And I didn't have to do anything for it.

7832
09:52:45,540 --> 09:52:47,540
I got some string.

7833
09:52:47,540 --> 09:52:49,540
I got a warming stone.

7834
09:52:51,540 --> 09:52:53,540
Yeah, fuck these plants up you.

7835
09:52:53,540 --> 09:52:55,540
That's what we think about you.

7836
09:52:59,540 --> 09:53:01,540
Uh, yeah.

7837
09:53:01,540 --> 09:53:03,540
I remember the first time I played Elden Ring.

7838
09:53:03,540 --> 09:53:05,540
Those plants were the bane of my existence.

7839
09:53:05,540 --> 09:53:07,540
I was so bad against them.

7840
09:53:09,540 --> 09:53:11,540
Uh, are we just running through this?

7841
09:53:13,540 --> 09:53:15,540
Did you take fall damage for that?

7842
09:53:15,540 --> 09:53:17,540
No, you took...

7843
09:53:17,540 --> 09:53:19,540
Oh, there's basilisks!

7844
09:53:19,540 --> 09:53:21,540
Okay.

7845
09:53:21,540 --> 09:53:23,540
This could have gone slightly better.

7846
09:53:23,540 --> 09:53:25,540
I'm gonna be honest.

7847
09:53:27,540 --> 09:53:29,540
I'm out, I'm out.

7848
09:53:29,540 --> 09:53:31,540
And for that reason, I'm out.

7849
09:53:31,540 --> 09:53:33,540
Run, Reflings, run!

7850
09:53:33,540 --> 09:53:35,540
Run, Reflings.

7851
09:53:35,540 --> 09:53:37,540
As soon as you come in the hallway, it's safe.

7852
09:53:37,540 --> 09:53:39,540
It's so safe, there's a fucking...

7853
09:53:41,540 --> 09:53:43,540
Why would there be one here?

7854
09:53:43,540 --> 09:53:45,540
Go to sleep, please, permanently.

7855
09:53:45,540 --> 09:53:47,540
Don't ever come back, thank you.

7856
09:53:47,540 --> 09:53:49,540
Are they chasing us up the fucking thing?

7857
09:53:49,540 --> 09:53:51,540
Out.

7858
09:53:51,540 --> 09:53:53,540
Okay, right, I think my bottle's okay.

7859
09:53:53,540 --> 09:53:55,540
Is he still alive?

7860
09:53:55,540 --> 09:53:57,540
Oh, I missed.

7861
09:53:57,540 --> 09:53:59,540
I'm sorry, Reflings.

7862
09:53:59,540 --> 09:54:01,540
Okay, jeez.

7863
09:54:01,540 --> 09:54:03,540
No.

7864
09:54:03,540 --> 09:54:05,540
No what?

7865
09:54:11,540 --> 09:54:13,540
Where we go?

7866
09:54:13,540 --> 09:54:15,540
We go back?

7867
09:54:19,540 --> 09:54:21,540
Nope, I woke up that plant.

7868
09:54:21,540 --> 09:54:23,540
Wait, are we lost?

7869
09:54:25,540 --> 09:54:27,540
We finished the DLC.

7870
09:54:27,540 --> 09:54:29,540
We're just doing the base game again.

7871
09:54:29,540 --> 09:54:31,540
And we're gonna do the mad...

7872
09:54:31,540 --> 09:54:33,540
A little bit of madness.

7873
09:54:37,540 --> 09:54:39,540
Okay, we got the plant.

7874
09:54:39,540 --> 09:54:41,540
I think it's like 0A, I think that.

7875
09:54:41,540 --> 09:54:43,540
Okay, one minute!

7876
09:54:45,540 --> 09:54:47,540
Did we go the wrong turn?

7877
09:54:49,540 --> 09:54:51,540
Emmy had 50k!

7878
09:54:51,540 --> 09:54:53,540
Yeah!

7879
09:54:53,540 --> 09:54:55,540
Happy 50k, Emmy!

7880
09:54:55,540 --> 09:54:57,540
Happy 50k, Emmy!

7881
09:54:57,540 --> 09:54:59,540
You're halfway to the play button.

7882
09:54:59,540 --> 09:55:01,540
And you smell like one too.

7883
09:55:03,540 --> 09:55:05,540
Congrats, Emmy.

7884
09:55:05,540 --> 09:55:07,540
We love you.

7885
09:55:07,540 --> 09:55:09,540
Okay, we're in...

7886
09:55:09,540 --> 09:55:11,540
Here.

7887
09:55:13,540 --> 09:55:15,540
I would watch but spoilers.

7888
09:55:15,540 --> 09:55:17,540
For the base game?

7889
09:55:17,540 --> 09:55:21,540
Yeah, we finished the DLC so we went back to base game.

7890
09:55:21,540 --> 09:55:23,540
Oh, they're all in here?

7891
09:55:25,540 --> 09:55:27,540
Okay, let's...

7892
09:55:27,540 --> 09:55:29,540
I didn't say that didn't stagger him.

7893
09:55:33,540 --> 09:55:35,540
Yeah, Emmy, play button, no!

7894
09:55:37,540 --> 09:55:39,540
Emmy, get play button, no.

7895
09:55:41,540 --> 09:55:43,540
I've got the special attack, I didn't do anything.

7896
09:55:43,540 --> 09:55:45,540
Hee hee!

7897
09:55:45,540 --> 09:55:47,540
All me, baby.

7898
09:55:47,540 --> 09:55:49,540
Golden centipede all the way.

7899
09:55:55,540 --> 09:55:57,540
Okay.

7900
09:56:13,540 --> 09:56:15,540
Oh, open door, open door.

7901
09:56:15,540 --> 09:56:17,540
Okay, big...

7902
09:56:17,540 --> 09:56:19,540
Oh, sorry.

7903
09:56:19,540 --> 09:56:21,540
A birthday bunny raid!

7904
09:56:21,540 --> 09:56:23,540
Oh, happy birthday, Serenity!

7905
09:56:25,540 --> 09:56:27,540
Oh, did you don't even start already?

7906
09:56:27,540 --> 09:56:29,540
I saw your Twitter post, did it already start?

7907
09:56:29,540 --> 09:56:31,540
Please pass out and rest well.

7908
09:56:33,540 --> 09:56:35,540
Oh, thank you so much for the read and write, Serenity.

7909
09:56:35,540 --> 09:56:37,540
I'm Strony from

7910
09:56:37,540 --> 09:56:39,540
Generation 1 and Doge from Vealor.

7911
09:56:39,540 --> 09:56:41,540
I'm currently doing stream sniping on Elden Ring,

7912
09:56:41,540 --> 09:56:43,540
so if you'd like to join, you're more than welcome.

7913
09:56:43,540 --> 09:56:45,540
Please don't worry, Aim.

7914
09:56:47,540 --> 09:56:49,540
But happy birthday, Serenity, we hope you have happy birthday.

7915
09:56:51,540 --> 09:56:53,540
Happy birthday.

7916
09:56:53,540 --> 09:56:55,540
I know she's awake to sleep right now.

7917
09:56:57,540 --> 09:56:59,540
I do have a five-minute subscriber

7918
09:56:59,540 --> 09:57:01,540
chat thing on, so don't worry

7919
09:57:01,540 --> 09:57:03,540
if you can't talk.

7920
09:57:03,540 --> 09:57:05,540
I'll talk to you though, let me talk to you.

7921
09:57:07,540 --> 09:57:09,540
But yeah, we are...

7922
09:57:09,540 --> 09:57:11,540
Oh, she's...

7923
09:57:11,540 --> 09:57:13,540
Oh, sorry!

7924
09:57:13,540 --> 09:57:15,540
Sorry, Beefland, sorry. I thought you were an enemy.

7925
09:57:17,540 --> 09:57:19,540
But we Elden that ring, hell yeah we are.

7926
09:57:19,540 --> 09:57:21,540
I'm currently being gated.

7927
09:57:21,540 --> 09:57:23,540
We finished the DLC.

7928
09:57:23,540 --> 09:57:25,540
It totally wasn't because of a glitch.

7929
09:57:25,540 --> 09:57:27,540
Sorry, I've just hurt you again.

7930
09:57:27,540 --> 09:57:29,540
We're just going to do

7931
09:57:29,540 --> 09:57:31,540
the base up game

7932
09:57:31,540 --> 09:57:33,540
because I never actually finished it.

7933
09:57:33,540 --> 09:57:35,540
I jumped straight to the DLC

7934
09:57:35,540 --> 09:57:37,540
and we're going to do the frenzied flame

7935
09:57:37,540 --> 09:57:39,540
right now because I don't want

7936
09:57:39,540 --> 09:57:41,540
to sacrifice my maiden.

7937
09:57:43,540 --> 09:57:45,540
Sorry, we keep absolutely tearing up this

7938
09:57:45,540 --> 09:57:47,540
Beefland. He's like, bruv, I've had enough.

7939
09:57:49,540 --> 09:57:51,540
Distracted by raid accidentally boxed.

7940
09:57:51,540 --> 09:57:53,540
Where's all the Beefland? Have we lost them?

7941
09:57:53,540 --> 09:57:55,540
Did he fall down somewhere he shouldn't have?

7942
09:57:57,540 --> 09:57:59,540
Did we go in this pipe?

7943
09:57:59,540 --> 09:58:01,540
Mario style?

7944
09:58:01,540 --> 09:58:03,540
You want me to go down?

7945
09:58:07,540 --> 09:58:09,540
I'm not going down without you going down.

7946
09:58:09,540 --> 09:58:11,540
I thought we had to go in that pipe or something.

7947
09:58:11,540 --> 09:58:13,540
Go down, you're scaring me.

7948
09:58:13,540 --> 09:58:15,540
Fine, I'll go down.

7949
09:58:15,540 --> 09:58:17,540
Kick ladder.

7950
09:58:17,540 --> 09:58:19,540
Oh, kick ladder.

7951
09:58:21,540 --> 09:58:23,540
I would not have done that if you didn't.

7952
09:58:23,540 --> 09:58:25,540
I kid you not, I would not have done that.

7953
09:58:25,540 --> 09:58:27,540
Thank you, Beefland.

7954
09:58:27,540 --> 09:58:29,540
The maiden will hate you for it.

7955
09:58:29,540 --> 09:58:31,540
But then I'll take it away

7956
09:58:31,540 --> 09:58:33,540
with the needle.

7957
09:58:33,540 --> 09:58:35,540
And so then I'll be a good little

7958
09:58:35,540 --> 09:58:37,540
I'll be a good

7959
09:58:37,540 --> 09:58:39,540
Elden Lord.

7960
09:58:39,540 --> 09:58:41,540
And then we're just going to do the normal ending

7961
09:58:41,540 --> 09:58:43,540
because I've actually never done the Elden normal one.

7962
09:58:43,540 --> 09:58:45,540
I always end up marrying

7963
09:58:45,540 --> 09:58:47,540
a Rhianna.

7964
09:58:47,540 --> 09:58:49,540
Rhianna, Rhianna.

7965
09:58:53,540 --> 09:58:55,540
They get rather large down here, don't they?

7966
09:58:59,540 --> 09:59:01,540
Does Milena forgive you if you cure the flame?

7967
09:59:01,540 --> 09:59:03,540
Rani.

7968
09:59:05,540 --> 09:59:07,540
Her name is Jumpover.

7969
09:59:09,540 --> 09:59:11,540
I don't know where that other Beefland is.

7970
09:59:11,540 --> 09:59:13,540
There's no way he's catching up to us.

7971
09:59:13,540 --> 09:59:15,540
Unless

7972
09:59:15,540 --> 09:59:17,540
he knows the route.

7973
09:59:17,540 --> 09:59:19,540
I don't know where

7974
09:59:19,540 --> 09:59:21,540
my second Beefland went.

7975
09:59:27,540 --> 09:59:29,540
The four blue hands

7976
09:59:29,540 --> 09:59:31,540
to touch.

7977
09:59:35,540 --> 09:59:37,540
Just a little lost in this maze.

7978
09:59:37,540 --> 09:59:39,540
Just a wee bit.

7979
09:59:39,540 --> 09:59:41,540
I don't know.

7980
09:59:45,540 --> 09:59:47,540
One of these holes are for jumping in.

7981
09:59:47,540 --> 09:59:49,540
I don't know what one yet.

7982
09:59:49,540 --> 09:59:51,540
Because I just killed that rat there.

7983
09:59:51,540 --> 09:59:53,540
I'm being pranked.

7984
09:59:53,540 --> 09:59:55,540
They're pranking me.

7985
09:59:55,540 --> 09:59:57,540
You need to jump down in what hole though.

7986
09:59:59,540 --> 10:00:01,540
I found my Beefland.

7987
10:00:01,540 --> 10:00:03,540
I don't know how you got here, but I found you.

7988
10:00:03,540 --> 10:00:05,540
This one?

7989
10:00:05,540 --> 10:00:07,540
Nope, they seem to...

7990
10:00:07,540 --> 10:00:09,540
They seem to think it's this one.

7991
10:00:11,540 --> 10:00:13,540
I got Flintstone.

7992
10:00:13,540 --> 10:00:15,540
Can I open this?

7993
10:00:15,540 --> 10:00:17,540
I can!

7994
10:00:17,540 --> 10:00:19,540
Alright, let me beat him up.

7995
10:00:19,540 --> 10:00:21,540
Oh, there's a basilisk.

7996
10:00:21,540 --> 10:00:23,540
I'm scared of it.

7997
10:00:23,540 --> 10:00:25,540
This one?

7998
10:00:25,540 --> 10:00:27,540
Again, need to leash for their

7999
10:00:27,540 --> 10:00:29,540
reeflings, honestly.

8000
10:00:31,540 --> 10:00:33,540
Mummy's lost her reeflings this stream?

8001
10:00:33,540 --> 10:00:35,540
No, the first time was terrible.

8002
10:00:35,540 --> 10:00:37,540
We could not figure out where that reefling was.

8003
10:00:37,540 --> 10:00:39,540
And then all of a sudden,

8004
10:00:39,540 --> 10:00:41,540
I'm at the boss.

8005
10:00:41,540 --> 10:00:43,540
What do you mean you're at the boss?

8006
10:00:43,540 --> 10:00:45,540
We are where the boss is.

8007
10:00:45,540 --> 10:00:47,540
You can't be at the boss.

8008
10:00:47,540 --> 10:00:49,540
That's not how it works.

8009
10:00:55,540 --> 10:00:57,540
I prefer when the pots look like this.

8010
10:00:57,540 --> 10:00:59,540
Not the meatback version.

8011
10:00:59,540 --> 10:01:01,540
Oh!

8012
10:01:01,540 --> 10:01:03,540
Oh my.

8013
10:01:03,540 --> 10:01:05,540
Oh my.

8014
10:01:05,540 --> 10:01:07,540
You cannot pass.

8015
10:01:07,540 --> 10:01:09,540
We're going to run a train on this pad reefling.

8016
10:01:09,540 --> 10:01:11,540
Head to our block again, this one.

8017
10:01:11,540 --> 10:01:13,540
Pat, pat, pat, pat.

8018
10:01:13,540 --> 10:01:15,540
Pat, pat, pat, pat.

8019
10:01:15,540 --> 10:01:17,540
We're all going on the lift together.

8020
10:01:23,540 --> 10:01:25,540
Are you clapping?

8021
10:01:25,540 --> 10:01:27,540
Who's making clapping noises?

8022
10:01:27,540 --> 10:01:29,540
Are you putting me to sleep?

8023
10:01:29,540 --> 10:01:31,540
I swear.

8024
10:01:31,540 --> 10:01:33,540
What is it called? Is it like

8025
10:01:33,540 --> 10:01:35,540
Samofili or something like that?

8026
10:01:35,540 --> 10:01:37,540
I think so.

8027
10:01:37,540 --> 10:01:39,540
Whoa! Reefling, no!

8028
10:01:39,540 --> 10:01:41,540
Okay, don't die, don't die.

8029
10:01:43,540 --> 10:01:45,540
Okay, touch grace.

8030
10:01:47,540 --> 10:01:49,540
Touch grace.

8031
10:01:49,540 --> 10:01:51,540
The platforming to get done is going to be fun.

8032
10:01:51,540 --> 10:01:53,540
Okay, this is the part I'm not

8033
10:01:53,540 --> 10:01:55,540
looking forward to.

8034
10:01:55,540 --> 10:01:57,540
Because I think this is where

8035
10:01:57,540 --> 10:01:59,540
it goes terribly wrong for us.

8036
10:01:59,540 --> 10:02:01,540
Does it not?

8037
10:02:03,540 --> 10:02:05,540
Rest well sleepy head.

8038
10:02:05,540 --> 10:02:07,540
Go sleep.

8039
10:02:07,540 --> 10:02:09,540
Reeflings, I need to sleep.

8040
10:02:09,540 --> 10:02:11,540
I don't normally stream at this time.

8041
10:02:13,540 --> 10:02:15,540
Oh, here he is.

8042
10:02:17,540 --> 10:02:19,540
Okay.

8043
10:02:19,540 --> 10:02:21,540
Okay.

8044
10:02:21,540 --> 10:02:23,540
I completely

8045
10:02:23,540 --> 10:02:25,540
forgot all attacks this guy does.

8046
10:02:25,540 --> 10:02:27,540
So I'm just going for it.

8047
10:02:27,540 --> 10:02:29,540
I missed.

8048
10:02:31,540 --> 10:02:33,540
Oh, he does blood spells?

8049
10:02:33,540 --> 10:02:35,540
One, I'm not sure that one.

8050
10:02:35,540 --> 10:02:37,540
I didn't like that one.

8051
10:02:39,540 --> 10:02:41,540
Wait, is this not the guy that's

8052
10:02:41,540 --> 10:02:43,540
outside the egg?

8053
10:02:45,540 --> 10:02:47,540
In the star world?

8054
10:02:47,540 --> 10:02:49,540
In the star world?

8055
10:02:51,540 --> 10:02:53,540
Oh, jeez.

8056
10:02:53,540 --> 10:02:55,540
He guards the frenzied flame?

8057
10:02:59,540 --> 10:03:01,540
It's complicated, yeah.

8058
10:03:03,540 --> 10:03:05,540
I do get that impression.

8059
10:03:05,540 --> 10:03:07,540
Oh.

8060
10:03:15,540 --> 10:03:17,540
How unique.

8061
10:03:17,540 --> 10:03:19,540
Oh wait, blood magic.

8062
10:03:21,540 --> 10:03:23,540
And he does the fire one as soon as I go under it.

8063
10:03:23,540 --> 10:03:25,540
Oh, there we go.

8064
10:03:25,540 --> 10:03:27,540
We did it, we did it.

8065
10:03:27,540 --> 10:03:29,540
Madness, no.

8066
10:03:29,540 --> 10:03:31,540
I got an achievement for the

8067
10:03:31,540 --> 10:03:33,540
Madness.

8068
10:03:33,540 --> 10:03:35,540
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

8069
10:03:35,540 --> 10:03:37,540
We did it, we did it, we did it.

8070
10:03:37,540 --> 10:03:39,540
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

8071
10:03:41,540 --> 10:03:43,540
I'm going to touch the grace.

8072
10:03:43,540 --> 10:03:45,540
I don't think I can summon you for a while.

8073
10:03:45,540 --> 10:03:47,540
Is this the one where I open the chest

8074
10:03:47,540 --> 10:03:49,540
and then knock at it or something?

8075
10:03:49,540 --> 10:03:51,540
Wait, hold on.

8076
10:03:51,540 --> 10:03:53,540
I'm going to level up if I can.

8077
10:03:53,540 --> 10:03:55,540
I've got 600 things.

8078
10:03:55,540 --> 10:03:57,540
This is just his day job, honestly.

8079
10:03:57,540 --> 10:03:59,540
Sure, let's put my

8080
10:03:59,540 --> 10:04:01,540
thing up by like 5 points.

8081
10:04:01,540 --> 10:04:03,540
Okay, I'm like 99% sure.

8082
10:04:03,540 --> 10:04:05,540
Yeah, I'm not allowed to go.

8083
10:04:05,540 --> 10:04:07,540
I like bump this and then it goes

8084
10:04:07,540 --> 10:04:09,540
behind.

8085
10:04:09,540 --> 10:04:11,540
Is that a bump?

8086
10:04:11,540 --> 10:04:13,540
Yeah, okay.

8087
10:04:13,540 --> 10:04:15,540
And then I'm not allowed you guys

8088
10:04:15,540 --> 10:04:17,540
for this, but I'm like

8089
10:04:17,540 --> 10:04:19,540
100% sure I'm not allowed to.

8090
10:04:23,540 --> 10:04:25,540
Yeah, they're like all twisted and stuff.

8091
10:04:25,540 --> 10:04:27,540
I think there's only a few that actually

8092
10:04:27,540 --> 10:04:29,540
fight.

8093
10:04:29,540 --> 10:04:31,540
They don't want to fight or something.

8094
10:04:33,540 --> 10:04:35,540
Hear them.

8095
10:04:35,540 --> 10:04:37,540
I can't remember the...

8096
10:04:41,540 --> 10:04:43,540
Yeah, isn't there an item here?

8097
10:04:43,540 --> 10:04:45,540
Yeah, there is.

8098
10:04:45,540 --> 10:04:47,540
Hold on, how do I get into it?

8099
10:04:47,540 --> 10:04:49,540
Roll.

8100
10:04:49,540 --> 10:04:51,540
Oh, I can't.

8101
10:04:51,540 --> 10:04:53,540
I can't get the item?

8102
10:04:53,540 --> 10:04:55,540
Sure, whatever.

8103
10:04:59,540 --> 10:05:01,540
I like playing music and stuff.

8104
10:05:05,540 --> 10:05:07,540
Uh...

8105
10:05:07,540 --> 10:05:09,540
Oh, sure.

8106
10:05:11,540 --> 10:05:13,540
Okay, this is

8107
10:05:13,540 --> 10:05:15,540
not gonna go well.

8108
10:05:15,540 --> 10:05:17,540
This is gonna take me quite a few

8109
10:05:17,540 --> 10:05:19,540
days.

8110
10:05:19,540 --> 10:05:21,540
Is something targeting me?

8111
10:05:23,540 --> 10:05:25,540
I'm edging.

8112
10:05:25,540 --> 10:05:27,540
I'm edging.

8113
10:05:27,540 --> 10:05:29,540
I'm edging.

8114
10:05:29,540 --> 10:05:31,540
Gentle.

8115
10:05:31,540 --> 10:05:33,540
Okay, that's a good game.

8116
10:05:33,540 --> 10:05:35,540
Does he attack me or does he just

8117
10:05:35,540 --> 10:05:37,540
keep playing whilst I hang out here? Hey,

8118
10:05:37,540 --> 10:05:39,540
it has got me.

8119
10:05:39,540 --> 10:05:41,540
Praise the merchant.

8120
10:05:41,540 --> 10:05:43,540
He is very lovely.

8121
10:05:43,540 --> 10:05:45,540
Gentle.

8122
10:05:45,540 --> 10:05:47,540
You have to use enemies.

8123
10:05:49,540 --> 10:05:51,540
Okay, okay, okay.

8124
10:05:51,540 --> 10:05:53,540
Maybe not this time for me.

8125
10:05:53,540 --> 10:05:55,540
Okay.

8126
10:05:55,540 --> 10:05:57,540
So...

8127
10:05:57,540 --> 10:05:59,540
So, so, so...

8128
10:05:59,540 --> 10:06:01,540
So, doesn't it?

8129
10:06:03,540 --> 10:06:05,540
Because...

8130
10:06:05,540 --> 10:06:07,540
This one?

8131
10:06:11,540 --> 10:06:13,540
Is something swinging at me?

8132
10:06:15,540 --> 10:06:17,540
It sounds like something's swinging at me.

8133
10:06:19,540 --> 10:06:21,540
Is this one right?

8134
10:06:21,540 --> 10:06:23,540
The corner one?

8135
10:06:23,540 --> 10:06:25,540
The corner one?

8136
10:06:25,540 --> 10:06:27,540
Wait, actually?

8137
10:06:31,540 --> 10:06:33,540
The corner one does not

8138
10:06:33,540 --> 10:06:35,540
look right to me.

8139
10:06:35,540 --> 10:06:37,540
Go down and roll onto it.

8140
10:06:37,540 --> 10:06:39,540
Roll onto it!

8141
10:06:41,540 --> 10:06:43,540
Oh, you have too much faith in me.

8142
10:06:43,540 --> 10:06:45,540
Roll? That looks like a jump to me.

8143
10:06:45,540 --> 10:06:47,540
Like...

8144
10:06:47,540 --> 10:06:49,540
Oh, God, and roll really that much?

8145
10:06:51,540 --> 10:06:53,540
Honestly,

8146
10:06:53,540 --> 10:06:55,540
that one looks more promising.

8147
10:06:55,540 --> 10:06:57,540
It's ketchup, not blood, it's fine.

8148
10:06:57,540 --> 10:06:59,540
Okay, okay.

8149
10:06:59,540 --> 10:07:01,540
Here comes the death counter.

8150
10:07:01,540 --> 10:07:03,540
For fuck's sake, right?

8151
10:07:03,540 --> 10:07:05,540
That's why we're not rolling.

8152
10:07:05,540 --> 10:07:07,540
That's why we're not rolling.

8153
10:07:07,540 --> 10:07:09,540
I don't know why you said roll.

8154
10:07:09,540 --> 10:07:11,540
Okay, the death counter is one.

8155
10:07:13,540 --> 10:07:15,540
Surely this won't take me

8156
10:07:15,540 --> 10:07:17,540
to the end of the endurance stream.

8157
10:07:17,540 --> 10:07:19,540
Surely.

8158
10:07:19,540 --> 10:07:21,540
Hold six feet.

8159
10:07:21,540 --> 10:07:23,540
Take armor off.

8160
10:07:23,540 --> 10:07:25,540
Okay, naked time.

8161
10:07:25,540 --> 10:07:27,540
You don't have to tell me twice, right?

8162
10:07:27,540 --> 10:07:29,540
You, off.

8163
10:07:29,540 --> 10:07:31,540
Then you, off.

8164
10:07:31,540 --> 10:07:33,540
Then you, off.

8165
10:07:33,540 --> 10:07:35,540
Then you.

8166
10:07:37,540 --> 10:07:39,540
There we go.

8167
10:07:41,540 --> 10:07:43,540
Fuck them up.

8168
10:07:43,540 --> 10:07:45,540
Jump down here.

8169
10:07:45,540 --> 10:07:47,540
There was one guy here.

8170
10:07:47,540 --> 10:07:49,540
I don't really care enough

8171
10:07:49,540 --> 10:07:51,540
to fall over that.

8172
10:07:51,540 --> 10:07:53,540
Oh, Jesus, I'm so fast.

8173
10:07:57,540 --> 10:07:59,540
I mean, it's not really

8174
10:07:59,540 --> 10:08:01,540
that important to me.

8175
10:08:01,540 --> 10:08:03,540
I have the souls, but sure.

8176
10:08:03,540 --> 10:08:05,540
Right, I'm going to believe you

8177
10:08:05,540 --> 10:08:07,540
again to roll.

8178
10:08:07,540 --> 10:08:09,540
You know what, fuck you. I press B.

8179
10:08:09,540 --> 10:08:11,540
I press B.

8180
10:08:11,540 --> 10:08:13,540
Okay, we're on two. That's fine.

8181
10:08:13,540 --> 10:08:15,540
You need to take the helmet off, too.

8182
10:08:15,540 --> 10:08:17,540
Wait, actually, if you

8183
10:08:17,540 --> 10:08:19,540
get those guys to shoot, they're fired.

8184
10:08:19,540 --> 10:08:21,540
Nah, that's okay.

8185
10:08:21,540 --> 10:08:23,540
Okay, let's try again.

8186
10:08:23,540 --> 10:08:25,540
That's fine.

8187
10:08:25,540 --> 10:08:27,540
I've got Aldi.

8188
10:08:27,540 --> 10:08:29,540
I don't know about you, but I have Aldi.

8189
10:08:31,540 --> 10:08:33,540
Right, who is squeaking

8190
10:08:33,540 --> 10:08:35,540
about over here? Someone is making noises.

8191
10:08:35,540 --> 10:08:37,540
It's you.

8192
10:08:37,540 --> 10:08:39,540
I can hear you.

8193
10:08:39,540 --> 10:08:41,540
Give up.

8194
10:08:41,540 --> 10:08:43,540
Grace, mimic.

8195
10:08:43,540 --> 10:08:45,540
I don't really know.

8196
10:08:47,540 --> 10:08:49,540
I'm not really bothered about his drip right now.

8197
10:08:49,540 --> 10:08:51,540
I can come back for it.

8198
10:08:51,540 --> 10:08:53,540
Right, fuck you.

8199
10:08:53,540 --> 10:08:55,540
How many times do I have to teach you

8200
10:08:55,540 --> 10:08:57,540
this lesson, old man?

8201
10:08:57,540 --> 10:08:59,540
Right, drop down.

8202
10:09:01,540 --> 10:09:03,540
Right.

8203
10:09:03,540 --> 10:09:05,540
Now, I'm going to do what I want to do,

8204
10:09:05,540 --> 10:09:07,540
which is a curve jump like that.

8205
10:09:07,540 --> 10:09:09,540
Yeah, take that, bitch.

8206
10:09:09,540 --> 10:09:11,540
Oh, no!

8207
10:09:11,540 --> 10:09:13,540
That went incredibly well.

8208
10:09:13,540 --> 10:09:15,540
All things considered.

8209
10:09:15,540 --> 10:09:17,540
What?

8210
10:09:17,540 --> 10:09:19,540
How did that work?

8211
10:09:19,540 --> 10:09:21,540
I don't know how that worked, but fuck it.

8212
10:09:21,540 --> 10:09:23,540
Okay, where'd I go next?

8213
10:09:23,540 --> 10:09:25,540
Corner?

8214
10:09:27,540 --> 10:09:29,540
Behold.

8215
10:09:29,540 --> 10:09:31,540
Oh, that's the furthest I've

8216
10:09:31,540 --> 10:09:33,540
literally ever gotten.

8217
10:09:33,540 --> 10:09:35,540
I don't know how I

8218
10:09:35,540 --> 10:09:37,540
freaking went backwards there, and it worked,

8219
10:09:37,540 --> 10:09:39,540
but it worked.

8220
10:09:39,540 --> 10:09:41,540
The furthest I've ever gotten, so progress.

8221
10:09:41,540 --> 10:09:43,540
Clam slam can skip

8222
10:09:43,540 --> 10:09:45,540
the whole segment. Wait, real?

8223
10:09:47,540 --> 10:09:49,540
Okay, that's three.

8224
10:09:51,540 --> 10:09:53,540
Okay, let's just...

8225
10:09:53,540 --> 10:09:55,540
Not the wrong way.

8226
10:09:59,540 --> 10:10:01,540
I kind of feel bad killing the same guys

8227
10:10:01,540 --> 10:10:03,540
over and over. I wonder if I could just leave them.

8228
10:10:05,540 --> 10:10:07,540
I feel like it's really mean.

8229
10:10:08,540 --> 10:10:10,540
Okay, well, maybe...

8230
10:10:16,540 --> 10:10:18,540
I think I feel rushed if I don't kill them,

8231
10:10:18,540 --> 10:10:20,540
so maybe I will kill them next time.

8232
10:10:24,540 --> 10:10:26,540
Felt a bit rushed, you know?

8233
10:10:26,540 --> 10:10:28,540
Whereas I can take my time.

8234
10:10:29,540 --> 10:10:31,540
Impatient mummy. I was trying to get to the good part

8235
10:10:31,540 --> 10:10:33,540
at the end.

8236
10:10:33,540 --> 10:10:35,540
Can you blame me?

8237
10:10:38,540 --> 10:10:40,540
Okay, that's fine.

8238
10:10:43,540 --> 10:10:45,540
He's not an enemy.

8239
10:10:47,540 --> 10:10:49,540
Okay, let's try that again.

8240
10:10:54,540 --> 10:10:56,540
Did they really say,

8241
10:10:56,540 --> 10:10:58,540
let's play relax and music, because we know

8242
10:10:58,540 --> 10:11:00,540
they're going to be wanting to shoot themselves

8243
10:11:00,540 --> 10:11:02,540
trying to parkour in this game?

8244
10:11:02,540 --> 10:11:04,540
No, you did the B thing again.

8245
10:11:04,540 --> 10:11:06,540
How strange. I'm not used to that. Hold on.

8246
10:11:08,540 --> 10:11:10,540
Hmm.

8247
10:11:10,540 --> 10:11:12,540
Did we test this lamb?

8248
10:11:12,540 --> 10:11:14,540
Do you want me to?

8249
10:11:18,540 --> 10:11:20,540
I don't know why they made it, like, so tricky.

8250
10:11:22,540 --> 10:11:24,540
The music was actually taught

8251
10:11:24,540 --> 10:11:26,540
then by sentry to help them sleep

8252
10:11:26,540 --> 10:11:28,540
in Easter suffering.

8253
10:11:29,540 --> 10:11:31,540
I...

8254
10:11:31,540 --> 10:11:33,540
What is it? Yeah, I don't...

8255
10:11:33,540 --> 10:11:35,540
There's no way that's going to keep me

8256
10:11:35,540 --> 10:11:37,540
from perishing.

8257
10:11:42,540 --> 10:11:44,540
Oh, the hate killed me.

8258
10:11:44,540 --> 10:11:46,540
I wasn't actually slamming on to something.

8259
10:11:46,540 --> 10:11:48,540
The hate killed me. Hold on.

8260
10:11:48,540 --> 10:11:50,540
I need to slam onto, like, a tomb slab thing.

8261
10:11:51,540 --> 10:11:53,540
Test on me in any game.

8262
10:12:00,540 --> 10:12:02,540
I just need something to land on.

8263
10:12:02,540 --> 10:12:04,540
Like, your cock.

8264
10:12:05,540 --> 10:12:07,540
Oh!

8265
10:12:07,540 --> 10:12:09,540
I was trying to look in the direction.

8266
10:12:09,540 --> 10:12:11,540
Okay, another time, another time.

8267
10:12:13,540 --> 10:12:15,540
Yeah, I need to land on something.

8268
10:12:19,540 --> 10:12:21,540
Drop to the bottom beams first, okay.

8269
10:12:27,540 --> 10:12:29,540
Just aim for a corner.

8270
10:12:29,540 --> 10:12:31,540
I did, and I messed up.

8271
10:12:31,540 --> 10:12:33,540
I'll go in the second beam.

8272
10:12:33,540 --> 10:12:35,540
I'll go in the second beam.

8273
10:12:37,540 --> 10:12:39,540
Yeah, he knew I was coming.

8274
10:12:40,540 --> 10:12:42,540
As if you do that much damage.

8275
10:12:42,540 --> 10:12:44,540
What the fuck?

8276
10:12:44,540 --> 10:12:46,540
Oh, wait, I took off my armor.

8277
10:12:47,540 --> 10:12:49,540
I took off my armor.

8278
10:12:49,540 --> 10:12:51,540
I forgot.

8279
10:12:52,540 --> 10:12:54,540
I forgot to cut off, okay.

8280
10:12:58,540 --> 10:13:00,540
Right, so what, like this?

8281
10:13:01,540 --> 10:13:04,540
And then whose corner piece is first?

8282
10:13:05,540 --> 10:13:08,540
Honestly, this is the only corner piece that I can see.

8283
10:13:09,540 --> 10:13:12,540
Should I just be trying to, like, get as low as possible

8284
10:13:12,540 --> 10:13:14,540
to try and bypass it all?

8285
10:13:14,540 --> 10:13:16,540
Like, I can do this.

8286
10:13:16,540 --> 10:13:19,540
Why the fuck did you move like that?

8287
10:13:19,540 --> 10:13:22,540
What, and then climb slam?

8288
10:13:24,540 --> 10:13:25,540
Alright.

8289
10:13:25,540 --> 10:13:28,540
No, it's too much.

8290
10:13:29,540 --> 10:13:31,540
Am I, am I, like, mmm.

8291
10:13:34,540 --> 10:13:36,540
Hmm.

8292
10:13:37,540 --> 10:13:39,540
Hmm.

8293
10:13:40,540 --> 10:13:42,540
Rest well, sleepyhead.

8294
10:13:45,540 --> 10:13:47,540
Mmm, have a good night.

8295
10:13:47,540 --> 10:13:49,540
Have a good night.

8296
10:13:49,540 --> 10:13:51,540
How do you be so nice?

8297
10:13:51,540 --> 10:13:53,540
Oh, I forget I'm super weak against these guys.

8298
10:13:53,540 --> 10:13:55,540
Hold on.

8299
10:13:56,540 --> 10:13:58,540
Actually scared of them now.

8300
10:13:58,540 --> 10:14:00,540
Actually scared of them.

8301
10:14:00,540 --> 10:14:02,540
Hold on.

8302
10:14:03,540 --> 10:14:04,540
Okay.

8303
10:14:04,540 --> 10:14:08,540
Whoa, can you maybe, oh, that worked out rather well somehow.

8304
10:14:09,540 --> 10:14:10,540
Okay, right.

8305
10:14:10,540 --> 10:14:12,540
Now jump over there.

8306
10:14:12,540 --> 10:14:13,540
Why?

8307
10:14:13,540 --> 10:14:15,540
That was correct.

8308
10:14:19,540 --> 10:14:21,540
Is it canceling immediately?

8309
10:14:21,540 --> 10:14:24,540
No, I'm not even getting in position to do it.

8310
10:14:24,540 --> 10:14:26,540
I'm, like, falling off.

8311
10:14:26,540 --> 10:14:28,540
Man of fellow.

8312
10:14:33,540 --> 10:14:37,540
Because I'm naked, I'm now scared of the merchant guys.

8313
10:14:37,540 --> 10:14:41,540
Which is adding to my pressure!

8314
10:14:46,540 --> 10:14:49,540
No! You come!

8315
10:14:54,540 --> 10:14:59,540
She's just so sure for you.

8316
10:15:07,540 --> 10:15:09,540
I am scared of the merchant, no!

8317
10:15:09,540 --> 10:15:11,540
Because I'm so naked.

8318
10:15:12,540 --> 10:15:14,540
The arseholes.

8319
10:15:15,540 --> 10:15:17,540
Don't look at me, I'm naked and afraid.

8320
10:15:18,540 --> 10:15:19,540
Okay.

8321
10:15:20,540 --> 10:15:22,540
That's fine.

8322
10:15:22,540 --> 10:15:24,540
Okay, next.

8323
10:15:24,540 --> 10:15:26,540
That's fine.

8324
10:15:26,540 --> 10:15:28,540
That's fine.

8325
10:15:28,540 --> 10:15:29,540
No, it's not apparently.

8326
10:15:29,540 --> 10:15:31,540
Why did you randomly jump?

8327
10:15:31,540 --> 10:15:34,540
Well, I found the platform at least over here.

8328
10:15:35,540 --> 10:15:37,540
If I hit it.

8329
10:15:41,540 --> 10:15:44,540
Did it just do it with full armor on?

8330
10:15:45,540 --> 10:15:48,540
Is it banished now, I think?

8331
10:15:52,540 --> 10:15:55,540
The gauntlets of Solitude, yeah, bruv.

8332
10:15:59,540 --> 10:16:01,540
I'm definitely not as fast.

8333
10:16:01,540 --> 10:16:03,540
I spent jump for...

8334
10:16:03,540 --> 10:16:07,540
I just feel like I'm so heavy, though.

8335
10:16:08,540 --> 10:16:10,540
Fat bitch.

8336
10:16:11,540 --> 10:16:14,540
Sorry, I shouldn't say that.

8337
10:16:15,540 --> 10:16:18,540
Oh, and jump.

8338
10:16:22,540 --> 10:16:24,540
Sprint jump.

8339
10:16:26,540 --> 10:16:30,540
I definitely feel like I'm lacking critical information here.

8340
10:16:32,540 --> 10:16:36,540
Like, or did the developers want it to be like this?

8341
10:16:36,540 --> 10:16:38,540
Like this.

8342
10:16:46,540 --> 10:16:50,540
I mean, if they wanted it to be like this and shit, yeah, that's different, but...

8343
10:16:50,540 --> 10:16:52,540
Oh, and you're gonna miss it.

8344
10:16:52,540 --> 10:16:56,540
Okay, thanks for even attempting to touch that.

8345
10:16:57,540 --> 10:16:58,540
Stop the tour.

8346
10:16:58,540 --> 10:16:59,540
What's the death count?

8347
10:16:59,540 --> 10:17:01,540
I'm not even counting anymore.

8348
10:17:01,540 --> 10:17:04,540
Building up your madness?

8349
10:17:04,540 --> 10:17:06,540
Real and true, actually.

8350
10:17:06,540 --> 10:17:08,540
That's a really good point.

8351
10:17:08,540 --> 10:17:12,540
They're like, hey, we want you to do the same thing over and over again to really...

8352
10:17:12,540 --> 10:17:15,540
really get into the character that you're about to enter.

8353
10:17:15,540 --> 10:17:17,540
And I'm like, oh, okay, thanks, we're good.

8354
10:17:18,540 --> 10:17:19,540
And I missed.

8355
10:17:19,540 --> 10:17:20,540
Okay, well.

8356
10:17:23,540 --> 10:17:27,540
Not falling prevents taking lethal damage, real.

8357
10:17:28,540 --> 10:17:30,540
It's Miya...

8358
10:17:30,540 --> 10:17:34,540
Miya Zaki, so you're suffering as intended.

8359
10:17:35,540 --> 10:17:36,540
Hating the fall that kills you?

8360
10:17:36,540 --> 10:17:38,540
What, it's gravity?

8361
10:17:42,540 --> 10:17:43,540
Oh, I didn't mean that.

8362
10:17:43,540 --> 10:17:45,540
Well, okay.

8363
10:17:49,540 --> 10:17:50,540
Okay.

8364
10:17:51,540 --> 10:17:54,540
It's the sudden stop at the end.

8365
10:17:54,540 --> 10:17:57,540
I mean, yeah, that is her gravity word.

8366
10:17:58,540 --> 10:18:01,540
The love of gravity.

8367
10:18:05,540 --> 10:18:06,540
Let there be death.

8368
10:18:06,540 --> 10:18:08,540
Yeah, amen to that.

8369
10:18:10,540 --> 10:18:11,540
Go there.

8370
10:18:12,540 --> 10:18:13,540
Like that.

8371
10:18:14,540 --> 10:18:15,540
And I go...

8372
10:18:15,540 --> 10:18:16,540
there.

8373
10:18:18,540 --> 10:18:19,540
No?

8374
10:18:19,540 --> 10:18:20,540
Okay, or just slide off it?

8375
10:18:20,540 --> 10:18:21,540
Why not?

8376
10:18:22,540 --> 10:18:25,540
It's not like I want it to be alive down here anyway.

8377
10:18:30,540 --> 10:18:32,540
Giffy falling noises.

8378
10:18:33,540 --> 10:18:37,540
Thank you KOT Bricks for the extended membership, honestly.

8379
10:18:37,540 --> 10:18:39,540
Take your time and lean it up.

8380
10:18:40,540 --> 10:18:42,540
Yeah, lean up the fucking cockamuckers.

8381
10:18:42,540 --> 10:18:44,540
They're like, what the fuck is this shit?

8382
10:18:46,540 --> 10:18:49,540
Snapping your tentacle off at this rate.

8383
10:18:50,540 --> 10:18:51,540
Like...

8384
10:18:51,540 --> 10:18:53,540
Is that not lined up?

8385
10:18:53,540 --> 10:18:56,540
And then I'm gonna probably get fucking Kablamo'd off of it.

8386
10:18:57,540 --> 10:18:58,540
Right, run and jump.

8387
10:18:58,540 --> 10:18:59,540
Now I need to run and jump.

8388
10:18:59,540 --> 10:19:02,540
But they give me a fucking pixel fame prayer for one fucks sake.

8389
10:19:02,540 --> 10:19:04,540
Oh, it's just those games.

8390
10:19:05,540 --> 10:19:07,540
Oh, I'm so excited to play those games.

8391
10:19:08,540 --> 10:19:11,540
I love the way I get to hammer and run into it.

8392
10:19:11,540 --> 10:19:13,540
Whoa, oh my god, it turns me on.

8393
10:19:13,540 --> 10:19:14,540
Get teacock fun.

8394
10:19:15,540 --> 10:19:16,540
Oh, of course it was a corner piece.

8395
10:19:16,540 --> 10:19:18,540
That wasn't paying attention to fucking bastard.

8396
10:19:20,540 --> 10:19:21,540
Hmm.

8397
10:19:25,540 --> 10:19:26,540
Equipping ornaments.

8398
10:19:26,540 --> 10:19:29,540
You can equip up to three ornaments that time.

8399
10:19:29,540 --> 10:19:30,540
Okay.

8400
10:19:34,540 --> 10:19:35,540
Okay, I guess.

8401
10:19:35,540 --> 10:19:37,540
Okay, I love ornaments.

8402
10:19:39,540 --> 10:19:40,540
I love me a good ornament.

8403
10:19:40,540 --> 10:19:42,540
I don't know about you, but...

8404
10:19:43,540 --> 10:19:45,540
They really get the old blood going.

8405
10:19:46,540 --> 10:19:47,540
Hmm, line it up.

8406
10:19:48,540 --> 10:19:49,540
Line it up.

8407
10:19:50,540 --> 10:19:52,540
Back on the street.

8408
10:19:53,540 --> 10:19:54,540
Watch me not hit this.

8409
10:20:01,540 --> 10:20:03,540
I don't need to run on that one.

8410
10:20:03,540 --> 10:20:04,540
Then jump on that one.

8411
10:20:04,540 --> 10:20:05,540
And then the corner one.

8412
10:20:05,540 --> 10:20:06,540
First.

8413
10:20:07,540 --> 10:20:08,540
Okay.

8414
10:20:08,540 --> 10:20:09,540
And then that one.

8415
10:20:10,540 --> 10:20:11,540
And then the corner one.

8416
10:20:11,540 --> 10:20:12,540
Oh, it's not corner.

8417
10:20:12,540 --> 10:20:13,540
It's a lie.

8418
10:20:13,540 --> 10:20:14,540
That's what it is.

8419
10:20:14,540 --> 10:20:15,540
It's a lie.

8420
10:20:16,540 --> 10:20:17,540
Don't fall for the lies.

8421
10:20:17,540 --> 10:20:18,540
Right.

8422
10:20:18,540 --> 10:20:19,540
How do I get on this one below me?

8423
10:20:20,540 --> 10:20:21,540
Do I just edge on it?

8424
10:20:24,540 --> 10:20:25,540
Do I edge on it?

8425
10:20:26,540 --> 10:20:27,540
I think I edge on it.

8426
10:20:27,540 --> 10:20:28,540
I can't listen.

8427
10:20:28,540 --> 10:20:29,540
I do.

8428
10:20:29,540 --> 10:20:30,540
Ooh, I definitely do not edge on it.

8429
10:20:30,540 --> 10:20:31,540
Don't edge on it.

8430
10:20:31,540 --> 10:20:32,540
Wherever you do it.

8431
10:20:35,540 --> 10:20:36,540
I do not edge.

8432
10:20:36,540 --> 10:20:37,540
Don't edge on it.

8433
10:20:37,540 --> 10:20:38,540
Was this supposed to go back to the other one

8434
10:20:38,540 --> 10:20:39,540
and then plop myself down?

8435
10:20:41,540 --> 10:20:42,540
I don't think I...

8436
10:20:42,540 --> 10:20:43,540
I'm not sure.

8437
10:20:43,540 --> 10:20:44,540
The vision was the one.

8438
10:20:45,540 --> 10:20:46,540
Jump towards the corner.

8439
10:20:48,540 --> 10:20:49,540
Rest well.

8440
10:20:49,540 --> 10:20:50,540
Sleepy head.

8441
10:20:50,540 --> 10:20:51,540
Thank you for hanging with me.

8442
10:20:55,540 --> 10:20:56,540
Oh, rather than this.

8443
10:21:01,540 --> 10:21:02,540
I'm gonna go up a look.

8444
10:21:03,540 --> 10:21:04,540
I'm gonna go down a look.

8445
10:21:04,540 --> 10:21:05,540
Then run around the look.

8446
10:21:07,540 --> 10:21:08,540
Then run into the corner.

8447
10:21:08,540 --> 10:21:09,540
Ooh, or do a little...

8448
10:21:09,540 --> 10:21:10,540
Ooh, wherever that was.

8449
10:21:11,540 --> 10:21:12,540
The game aim.

8450
10:21:12,540 --> 10:21:14,540
Oh, and then just don't hit that one.

8451
10:21:14,540 --> 10:21:15,540
Hit the coolest move you've ever done

8452
10:21:15,540 --> 10:21:17,540
and then just don't do anything

8453
10:21:17,540 --> 10:21:18,540
at the next platform.

8454
10:21:18,540 --> 10:21:19,540
Hee hee.

8455
10:21:21,540 --> 10:21:22,540
Hee hee.

8456
10:21:25,540 --> 10:21:26,540
I'm a president.

8457
10:21:29,540 --> 10:21:30,540
And before it's only a Smith and Stone.

8458
10:21:30,540 --> 10:21:31,540
No, it's the next part of the story

8459
10:21:31,540 --> 10:21:32,540
that I want to do

8460
10:21:32,540 --> 10:21:34,540
because I've never done this part.

8461
10:21:35,540 --> 10:21:36,540
So I'm trying,

8462
10:21:36,540 --> 10:21:38,540
but my hands are getting really sway.

8463
10:21:38,540 --> 10:21:39,540
An anger?

8464
10:21:40,540 --> 10:21:42,540
Yes, my hands sway when I get angry.

8465
10:21:43,540 --> 10:21:44,540
No.

8466
10:21:44,540 --> 10:21:46,540
You cannot embarrass me about it.

8467
10:21:46,540 --> 10:21:47,540
I know my hands are sway.

8468
10:21:47,540 --> 10:21:48,540
I've accepted that.

8469
10:21:48,540 --> 10:21:50,540
I will always have sway hands.

8470
10:21:50,540 --> 10:21:51,540
It's just how I am.

8471
10:21:54,540 --> 10:21:56,540
And we missed again.

8472
10:22:02,540 --> 10:22:04,540
Make sure you do a flip.

8473
10:22:08,540 --> 10:22:10,540
So make mommy angry then.

8474
10:22:10,540 --> 10:22:12,540
You want to lick my hand sway?

8475
10:22:13,540 --> 10:22:14,540
I'm not...

8476
10:22:14,540 --> 10:22:16,540
I'm not sure you want that.

8477
10:22:17,540 --> 10:22:20,540
I get very sway when I play console.

8478
10:22:20,540 --> 10:22:21,540
Like controller.

8479
10:22:22,540 --> 10:22:24,540
But when you get mildly angry or frustrated,

8480
10:22:24,540 --> 10:22:26,540
this sway is like dripping.

8481
10:22:28,540 --> 10:22:29,540
I'm just angry.

8482
10:22:29,540 --> 10:22:30,540
Oh!

8483
10:22:36,540 --> 10:22:37,540
Hee.

8484
10:22:38,540 --> 10:22:40,540
Self-repricating.

8485
10:22:42,540 --> 10:22:44,540
I have the same issue when I get angry.

8486
10:22:44,540 --> 10:22:46,540
Extra spicy for a handy.

8487
10:22:46,540 --> 10:22:49,540
Purposely making my autistic girlfriend angry

8488
10:22:49,540 --> 10:22:53,540
to get extra wet handjob ASMR when?

8489
10:22:54,540 --> 10:22:55,540
Right now.

8490
10:22:56,540 --> 10:22:58,540
You can do it strong.

8491
10:22:58,540 --> 10:22:59,540
I believe in you.

8492
10:22:59,540 --> 10:23:00,540
I'm fucking doing it.

8493
10:23:01,540 --> 10:23:03,540
Just shake me when I watch this.

8494
10:23:04,540 --> 10:23:07,540
I just jumped to that one in the corner there.

8495
10:23:08,540 --> 10:23:10,540
Wait, it looks like it's on its own though.

8496
10:23:10,540 --> 10:23:12,540
Where am I supposed to jump to?

8497
10:23:16,540 --> 10:23:17,540
It looks...

8498
10:23:17,540 --> 10:23:18,540
It looks such a...

8499
10:23:21,540 --> 10:23:22,540
That's fine.

8500
10:23:22,540 --> 10:23:23,540
I didn't want to...

8501
10:23:23,540 --> 10:23:25,540
I didn't want to do this ending anyway.

8502
10:23:26,540 --> 10:23:29,540
Is your sway thing autism related yet autism?

8503
10:23:30,540 --> 10:23:32,540
I have permanently swayed hands and feet.

8504
10:23:32,540 --> 10:23:33,540
Speaking of hands,

8505
10:23:33,540 --> 10:23:35,540
I'm fucking gonna lick them right now.

8506
10:23:35,540 --> 10:23:36,540
Hold on.

8507
10:23:36,540 --> 10:23:38,540
Hold on. Let me wipe my hands on a fucking tissue

8508
10:23:38,540 --> 10:23:40,540
so I can actually grip the controller.

8509
10:23:42,540 --> 10:23:45,540
You can buffer the run on the spot

8510
10:23:45,540 --> 10:23:47,540
if you jump and hold the run button.

8511
10:23:49,540 --> 10:23:50,540
What?

8512
10:23:51,540 --> 10:23:52,540
Buffer?

8513
10:23:54,540 --> 10:23:55,540
Oh wow.

8514
10:23:56,540 --> 10:23:59,540
That is some fucking verical leap if you hold it.

8515
10:23:59,540 --> 10:24:00,540
I want to miss.

8516
10:24:00,540 --> 10:24:01,540
Whee!

8517
10:24:06,540 --> 10:24:07,540
Hyperhydrolysis.

8518
10:24:07,540 --> 10:24:08,540
Oh yeah.

8519
10:24:11,540 --> 10:24:12,540
Hold it.

8520
10:24:13,540 --> 10:24:14,540
Hold it.

8521
10:24:15,540 --> 10:24:16,540
Hold it.

8522
10:24:16,540 --> 10:24:17,540
Hold it.

8523
10:24:18,540 --> 10:24:19,540
Maybe.

8524
10:24:21,540 --> 10:24:22,540
Delivery catacombs.

8525
10:24:25,540 --> 10:24:26,540
Whee!

8526
10:24:31,540 --> 10:24:32,540
Oh, I'll piss off.

8527
10:24:32,540 --> 10:24:33,540
Whee!

8528
10:24:36,540 --> 10:24:37,540
Ugh.

8529
10:24:43,540 --> 10:24:44,540
This only has autism.

8530
10:24:46,540 --> 10:24:48,540
What point did the number come clear?

8531
10:24:49,540 --> 10:24:50,540
What point you had dose?

8532
10:24:56,540 --> 10:24:57,540
Sorry.

8533
10:25:00,540 --> 10:25:01,540
Hee hee.

8534
10:25:03,540 --> 10:25:04,540
Okay, that went well.

8535
10:25:04,540 --> 10:25:06,540
That could have actually have...

8536
10:25:06,540 --> 10:25:07,540
No, stop pressing.

8537
10:25:07,540 --> 10:25:09,540
Why do you do that, honestly?

8538
10:25:10,540 --> 10:25:11,540
Can you identify it?

8539
10:25:11,540 --> 10:25:12,540
Right.

8540
10:25:12,540 --> 10:25:13,540
Well, if you're gonna do it, do it now.

8541
10:25:13,540 --> 10:25:15,540
Oh, and the one time that I do it on purpose,

8542
10:25:15,540 --> 10:25:16,540
it doesn't work.

8543
10:25:16,540 --> 10:25:17,540
Ah, right.

8544
10:25:17,540 --> 10:25:18,540
Then I see how it is.

8545
10:25:20,540 --> 10:25:21,540
Astronautism.

8546
10:25:24,540 --> 10:25:26,540
Jess woke up and mommy's still screaming.

8547
10:25:26,540 --> 10:25:27,540
Did she beat the tears?

8548
10:25:27,540 --> 10:25:28,540
Yeah!

8549
10:25:28,540 --> 10:25:31,540
I beat that boss so hard.

8550
10:25:32,540 --> 10:25:35,540
We pummeled that boss into the ground.

8551
10:25:35,540 --> 10:25:37,540
Isn't we refling?

8552
10:25:38,540 --> 10:25:42,540
We pummeled the DLC boss so hard.

8553
10:25:42,540 --> 10:25:45,540
We pummeled him so hard coming up that lift.

8554
10:25:45,540 --> 10:25:49,540
The way he didn't anticipate our gravity shift.

8555
10:25:49,540 --> 10:25:51,540
Ooh, we got him good.

8556
10:25:52,540 --> 10:25:55,540
We encountered the freaking co-op glitch.

8557
10:25:55,540 --> 10:25:58,540
Oh, you fucking bastard, honestly.

8558
10:25:59,540 --> 10:26:00,540
Hmm.

8559
10:26:02,540 --> 10:26:04,540
VodWATCH is fast forward two days.

8560
10:26:04,540 --> 10:26:06,540
Real, I can't even argue against that.

8561
10:26:06,540 --> 10:26:07,540
Actually real.

8562
10:26:07,540 --> 10:26:09,540
I don't know if I can do this.

8563
10:26:09,540 --> 10:26:12,540
I'm being honest, I genuinely don't think I can do this.

8564
10:26:17,540 --> 10:26:22,540
Yeah, there's a DLC glitch where if you go up the elevator,

8565
10:26:22,540 --> 10:26:25,540
or the lift together and co-op,

8566
10:26:25,540 --> 10:26:29,540
it kills the fucking boss instantly.

8567
10:26:29,540 --> 10:26:31,540
So we didn't even get to do the fight,

8568
10:26:31,540 --> 10:26:34,540
so I had to be summoned into another refling's game.

8569
10:26:35,540 --> 10:26:37,540
Stop going fucking backwards.

8570
10:26:37,540 --> 10:26:40,540
I'll literally never use that button for anything else.

8571
10:26:40,540 --> 10:26:42,540
And the game's like, oh, did you want to do that?

8572
10:26:42,540 --> 10:26:44,540
No, I didn't fucking want to do that.

8573
10:26:44,540 --> 10:26:46,540
You fucking bastard, honestly.

8574
10:26:56,540 --> 10:26:59,540
I don't know if I'm better doing this off stream,

8575
10:26:59,540 --> 10:27:02,540
and then I come on tomorrow when I'm at the bottom.

8576
10:27:15,540 --> 10:27:17,540
That's real sure.

8577
10:27:18,540 --> 10:27:20,540
I

8578
10:27:24,540 --> 10:27:26,540
have no words.

8579
10:27:27,540 --> 10:27:30,540
My character has never moved faster.

8580
10:27:36,540 --> 10:27:40,540
My character has never moved faster than the entire game.

8581
10:27:40,540 --> 10:27:42,540
Against any god.

8582
10:27:42,540 --> 10:27:45,540
Godwin, fucking morgue,

8583
10:27:45,540 --> 10:27:47,540
fucking Rinala,

8584
10:27:47,540 --> 10:27:49,540
any of these gods, nah,

8585
10:27:49,540 --> 10:27:51,540
she doesn't give a shit.

8586
10:27:51,540 --> 10:27:53,540
The moment it comes to being delicate,

8587
10:27:53,540 --> 10:27:55,540
fucking dainty movements,

8588
10:27:55,540 --> 10:27:58,540
or let's just eat myself like a fucking catapult,

8589
10:27:58,540 --> 10:28:00,540
right, or right then.

8590
10:28:00,540 --> 10:28:03,540
Make it make sense, actually.

8591
10:28:03,540 --> 10:28:06,540
Like, so does the dev team know exactly what I want right now,

8592
10:28:06,540 --> 10:28:08,540
and they're not giving me it.

8593
10:28:08,540 --> 10:28:10,540
I honestly didn't care what they say,

8594
10:28:10,540 --> 10:28:13,540
they're actually such liars, like two-faced bastards.

8595
10:28:13,540 --> 10:28:15,540
Oh, gon' piss off.

8596
10:28:15,540 --> 10:28:17,540
Alright, actually that worked out well, sorry, excuse me.

8597
10:28:17,540 --> 10:28:19,540
I was not familiar with your game.

8598
10:28:19,540 --> 10:28:21,540
My apologies!

8599
10:28:21,540 --> 10:28:23,540
You fucking whore!

8600
10:28:23,540 --> 10:28:25,540
Oh my god!

8601
10:28:39,540 --> 10:28:41,540
I don't even know how I did that second one.

8602
10:28:41,540 --> 10:28:43,540
I don't even remember ever getting there.

8603
10:28:46,540 --> 10:28:48,540
Right, enough with the fast movement.

8604
10:28:48,540 --> 10:28:50,540
Relax.

8605
10:28:50,540 --> 10:28:52,540
I don't know why yours like so fast.

8606
10:28:52,540 --> 10:28:55,540
All of a sudden thinking it's Sega.

8607
10:28:55,540 --> 10:28:57,540
Nah, this is Formsoft, okay?

8608
10:28:57,540 --> 10:28:59,540
Or Fromsoft, whatever.

8609
10:28:59,540 --> 10:29:01,540
Just slow it down, seriously.

8610
10:29:01,540 --> 10:29:03,540
I don't know why we're going 100 miles a minute.

8611
10:29:03,540 --> 10:29:05,540
Relax.

8612
10:29:05,540 --> 10:29:08,540
And now, all of a sudden,

8613
10:29:09,540 --> 10:29:11,540
we're going 100 miles an hour, right?

8614
10:29:14,540 --> 10:29:16,540
Stop moving.

8615
10:29:16,540 --> 10:29:19,540
We're not gonna make that jump unless you run at it,

8616
10:29:19,540 --> 10:29:23,540
but you need to not fucking do that backwards jump thing, okay?

8617
10:29:23,540 --> 10:29:25,540
Ah, progress!

8618
10:29:27,540 --> 10:29:30,540
Right, same as before, it's not in the fucking corner,

8619
10:29:30,540 --> 10:29:32,540
but don't fly at it!

8620
10:29:32,540 --> 10:29:34,540
Oh my god.

8621
10:29:35,540 --> 10:29:37,540
Okay, same as before.

8622
10:29:37,540 --> 10:29:39,540
Don't do the backwards fucking jump either.

8623
10:29:39,540 --> 10:29:41,540
I swear to god.

8624
10:29:41,540 --> 10:29:43,540
Oh, am I here?

8625
10:29:45,540 --> 10:29:47,540
Did I do it?

8626
10:29:48,540 --> 10:29:50,540
Oh my god.

8627
10:29:50,540 --> 10:29:52,540
Did I need to put my armor on?

8628
10:29:52,540 --> 10:29:54,540
I'm scared, I'm putting my armor on.

8629
10:29:54,540 --> 10:29:56,540
I don't trust this, I don't like this at all.

8630
10:29:56,540 --> 10:29:58,540
Can I put it on here?

8631
10:29:59,540 --> 10:30:01,540
I don't trust this at all.

8632
10:30:01,540 --> 10:30:04,540
There's like someone here that beat me up to ruin my day right at the end.

8633
10:30:06,540 --> 10:30:08,540
I don't know who it is, but there's some fanny here

8634
10:30:08,540 --> 10:30:10,540
just waiting to jump scare me.

8635
10:30:10,540 --> 10:30:12,540
Is it him?

8636
10:30:14,540 --> 10:30:16,540
Are you evil?

8637
10:30:19,540 --> 10:30:21,540
Am I here?

8638
10:30:21,540 --> 10:30:23,540
Did I make it?

8639
10:30:25,540 --> 10:30:27,540
Can I come down?

8640
10:30:28,540 --> 10:30:30,540
Go down?

8641
10:30:38,540 --> 10:30:40,540
Oh my god.

8642
10:30:42,540 --> 10:30:45,540
I don't even have any serotonin at the end of that.

8643
10:30:45,540 --> 10:30:47,540
Just misery.

8644
10:30:48,540 --> 10:30:50,540
Now it's over.

8645
10:30:51,540 --> 10:30:53,540
Alright, what happens in this room?

8646
10:30:54,540 --> 10:30:57,540
I have to remove my armor?

8647
10:30:59,540 --> 10:31:01,540
Sure, I'll go naked, why not?

8648
10:31:03,540 --> 10:31:05,540
Did I take off my weapon as well or...?

8649
10:31:12,540 --> 10:31:14,540
That was awful, sorry.

8650
10:31:14,540 --> 10:31:18,540
If you can hear me moving about, I'm flapping my hands to get them to stop sweating.

8651
10:31:19,540 --> 10:31:21,540
To let the air...

8652
10:31:21,540 --> 10:31:23,540
Don't do it!

8653
10:31:23,540 --> 10:31:25,540
Get fingered.

8654
10:31:26,540 --> 10:31:29,540
No serotonin, only misery the truth.

8655
10:31:29,540 --> 10:31:31,540
I'm self-experienced.

8656
10:31:34,540 --> 10:31:38,540
Have you spoke to Melania at the grey she scolds you, but fuck it, we roll.

8657
10:31:41,540 --> 10:31:44,540
Excuse me for not taking my time at that.

8658
10:31:44,540 --> 10:31:46,540
She can get to you fuck.

8659
10:31:52,540 --> 10:31:55,540
That's actually kind of scary.

8660
10:31:55,540 --> 10:31:58,540
Damn, she looks like me for real, for real.

8661
10:32:08,540 --> 10:32:14,540
Wait, so only people who get to the bottom of that are allowed to become madness people?

8662
10:32:14,540 --> 10:32:18,540
Or is there different... there must be different ways you can get madness.

8663
10:32:19,540 --> 10:32:21,540
It burns!

8664
10:32:25,540 --> 10:32:27,540
It burns!

8665
10:32:39,540 --> 10:32:41,540
It hurts so good!

8666
10:32:42,540 --> 10:32:44,540
Hand tug.

8667
10:32:45,540 --> 10:32:51,540
Talked to her at the grey, oh am I getting scolded by my maiden?

8668
10:32:56,540 --> 10:32:59,540
Oh, is she gonna be pissed at me?

8669
10:32:59,540 --> 10:33:04,540
Oh look at her skin, we are burned, we literally carry the mark!

8670
10:33:04,540 --> 10:33:06,540
Hello!

8671
10:33:06,540 --> 10:33:08,540
She's gonna be pissed!

8672
10:33:09,540 --> 10:33:12,540
Hi, I did it to save you bitch.

8673
10:33:23,540 --> 10:33:25,540
I did it for you.

8674
10:33:34,540 --> 10:33:36,540
Yay!

8675
10:33:39,540 --> 10:33:42,540
Goodbye, my companion.

8676
10:33:42,540 --> 10:33:44,540
Goodbye, torrent.

8677
10:33:44,540 --> 10:33:46,540
Oh she has to leave torrent behind?

8678
10:33:46,540 --> 10:33:48,540
Oh that's a shame.

8679
10:33:48,540 --> 10:33:51,540
I did it for you, I did it for you.

8680
10:33:51,540 --> 10:33:55,540
I went through all of that for you, you just relax then.

8681
10:33:55,540 --> 10:34:01,540
I'll take it off me, okay I'll take it off me in a minute, just relax.

8682
10:34:02,540 --> 10:34:05,540
Did it for you!

8683
10:34:05,540 --> 10:34:09,540
Right, so then I go burn myself at the tree, right?

8684
10:34:10,540 --> 10:34:13,540
There might be enough time to be the game on stream.

8685
10:34:13,540 --> 10:34:16,540
Right, I go up to the ball, right?

8686
10:34:19,540 --> 10:34:21,540
Look at your eyes.

8687
10:34:22,540 --> 10:34:25,540
Oh are they glowing yellow?

8688
10:34:26,540 --> 10:34:29,540
Oh shit, let me take this off, hold on.

8689
10:34:29,540 --> 10:34:33,540
Oh yeah they are, I glow with it!

8690
10:34:33,540 --> 10:34:35,540
Wow.

8691
10:34:36,540 --> 10:34:40,540
Oh god did I forget to pick up the damn thing?

8692
10:34:42,540 --> 10:34:45,540
I forgot to pick up a grey sight back there.

8693
10:34:46,540 --> 10:34:48,540
I'm frenzied, plop plop plop plop.

8694
10:34:48,540 --> 10:34:51,540
You can remove the burn marks in character customization.

8695
10:34:51,540 --> 10:34:53,540
Oh no that don't bother me none.

8696
10:34:54,540 --> 10:34:56,540
One hour life for stream though?

8697
10:34:56,540 --> 10:34:59,540
Oh it was a tight schedule.

8698
10:34:59,540 --> 10:35:02,540
Wait how did I get across here?

8699
10:35:04,540 --> 10:35:05,540
What?

8700
10:35:06,540 --> 10:35:08,540
Chain, chain now.

8701
10:35:11,540 --> 10:35:19,540
We'll burn it and then we'll be goody goody gum drops and take it off with this needle.

8702
10:35:20,540 --> 10:35:24,540
Frenzied flame stones heal you now instead of causing madness?

8703
10:35:24,540 --> 10:35:27,540
Oh that's a good detail, I like that detail.

8704
10:35:34,540 --> 10:35:36,540
Oh wait I've got the wrong sword on.

8705
10:35:36,540 --> 10:35:39,540
This isn't my sword, I need my big peepee sword.

8706
10:35:39,540 --> 10:35:41,540
There we go.

8707
10:35:42,540 --> 10:35:45,540
Wait did I just take it off my face?

8708
10:35:46,540 --> 10:35:47,540
I did!

8709
10:35:47,540 --> 10:35:50,540
Right maybe, I don't know, take the sword out?

8710
10:35:51,540 --> 10:35:55,540
Still a madness spell gives you more madness though.

8711
10:35:55,540 --> 10:36:06,540
I suppose you could argue that too much of anything is bad for you, even if what a part of you is.

8712
10:36:08,540 --> 10:36:11,540
There's not a fight here, is there if there is already for gore?

8713
10:36:13,540 --> 10:36:14,540
Is there a fight here?

8714
10:36:14,540 --> 10:36:17,540
No, there can't be, there's not a save station.

8715
10:36:20,540 --> 10:36:22,540
Come on I'm torn.

8716
10:36:23,540 --> 10:36:25,540
Where do I burn myself?

8717
10:36:26,540 --> 10:36:27,540
Is it at the age of it?

8718
10:36:27,540 --> 10:36:29,540
Or is it the right side or the left side?

8719
10:36:29,540 --> 10:36:31,540
I can never remember.

8720
10:36:31,540 --> 10:36:32,540
Oh this side.

8721
10:36:41,540 --> 10:36:42,540
Left side.

8722
10:36:43,540 --> 10:36:46,540
There's never a thing such as too much moume?

8723
10:36:47,540 --> 10:36:59,540
I guess if we don't finish today then tomorrow can be a shorter stream and I can do some behind the scenes work which is not a problem.

8724
10:37:03,540 --> 10:37:05,540
The madness and juicing ASMR.

8725
10:37:10,540 --> 10:37:11,540
Torrent!

8726
10:37:12,540 --> 10:37:15,540
You're wet fart, you got me nervous.

8727
10:37:15,540 --> 10:37:17,540
Right, can I sacrifice myself here?

8728
10:37:18,540 --> 10:37:20,540
Listen to the sound of flame?

8729
10:37:24,540 --> 10:37:26,540
That sounds like it to me.

8730
10:37:35,540 --> 10:37:36,540
Time to burn.

8731
10:37:37,540 --> 10:37:40,540
Call me big rabbit cos I'm about to burn.

8732
10:37:42,540 --> 10:37:44,540
After the poet Robert Burns.

8733
10:37:46,540 --> 10:37:50,540
I offer myself unto thee.

8734
10:37:53,540 --> 10:37:55,540
It definitely sounds like madness in there.

8735
10:37:58,540 --> 10:38:00,540
I should have taken my clothes off.

8736
10:38:10,540 --> 10:38:12,540
Am I going to burn alive?

8737
10:38:15,540 --> 10:38:16,540
Yeah.

8738
10:38:24,540 --> 10:38:26,540
Okay where do we go for the needle?

8739
10:38:39,540 --> 10:38:41,540
I like how I just don't say anything.

8740
10:38:41,540 --> 10:38:43,540
I'm just happy to be here.

8741
10:38:46,540 --> 10:38:47,540
Hmm?

8742
10:38:55,540 --> 10:38:58,540
If I put my body in there how am I still being chillin'?

8743
10:39:00,540 --> 10:39:04,540
You died? Yeah hell yeah I died cos literally what?

8744
10:39:11,540 --> 10:39:13,540
The flame keeps you alive.

8745
10:39:14,540 --> 10:39:16,540
Oh the frenzied.

8746
10:39:17,540 --> 10:39:19,540
Why get rid of it now?

8747
10:39:19,540 --> 10:39:22,540
Because I don't want the world to end.

8748
10:39:22,540 --> 10:39:24,540
I want it to save my maiden.

8749
10:39:31,540 --> 10:39:33,540
Oh god we're in the dragon place now?

8750
10:39:38,540 --> 10:39:41,540
Church of the Plague in Caled.

8751
10:39:44,540 --> 10:39:46,540
Dragon Disney.

8752
10:39:49,540 --> 10:39:51,540
I need to find a...

8753
10:39:51,540 --> 10:39:54,540
Okay I'll find the first save thing in my Bulber.

8754
10:39:56,540 --> 10:39:58,540
Can I turn on this? Thank you.

8755
10:40:00,540 --> 10:40:03,540
Right we'll go to Caled. I just need to find a grey site.

8756
10:40:07,540 --> 10:40:09,540
Can I have one grey site please?

8757
10:40:10,540 --> 10:40:11,540
Whoa.

8758
10:40:11,540 --> 10:40:13,540
Okay I knew it was this way.

8759
10:40:13,540 --> 10:40:15,540
I didn't realise there were that many gaps.

8760
10:40:17,540 --> 10:40:19,540
Where's the grey site?

8761
10:40:20,540 --> 10:40:21,540
Azula?

8762
10:40:23,540 --> 10:40:25,540
Not Azur or Duly?

8763
10:40:26,540 --> 10:40:28,540
The hit VTuber for Gen 1 indulge?

8764
10:40:34,540 --> 10:40:36,540
Can I run through this? Surely.

8765
10:40:37,540 --> 10:40:39,540
I'm sure it's fine.

8766
10:40:39,540 --> 10:40:41,540
I'm off.

8767
10:40:41,540 --> 10:40:44,540
Little bit of bloodlust never hurt anyone.

8768
10:40:51,540 --> 10:40:54,540
Yes I'm going to sit down. Leave me alone.

8769
10:40:54,540 --> 10:40:57,540
Leave me alone. No let me sit down.

8770
10:41:01,540 --> 10:41:02,540
What?

8771
10:41:02,540 --> 10:41:05,540
You guys are such liars right now.

8772
10:41:05,540 --> 10:41:07,540
Be so free all.

8773
10:41:08,540 --> 10:41:10,540
I'm literally not allowed to sit down.

8774
10:41:11,540 --> 10:41:14,540
I'm getting fucking gang violence.

8775
10:41:14,540 --> 10:41:16,540
Oh piss off bro I got it.

8776
10:41:16,540 --> 10:41:17,540
Did I hit it?

8777
10:41:17,540 --> 10:41:19,540
I just wouldn't let me sit down.

8778
10:41:20,540 --> 10:41:21,540
Whatever.

8779
10:41:29,540 --> 10:41:31,540
At least I had to do that.

8780
10:41:31,540 --> 10:41:33,540
Right we've got our first thing.

8781
10:41:34,540 --> 10:41:37,540
So I need to go to Caled's womb.

8782
10:41:38,540 --> 10:41:40,540
What was it? The church?

8783
10:41:40,540 --> 10:41:42,540
A church? This church?

8784
10:41:42,540 --> 10:41:44,540
Church of ruins?

8785
10:41:45,540 --> 10:41:47,540
I want church of the plague.

8786
10:41:47,540 --> 10:41:49,540
Wait why can't I?

8787
10:41:49,540 --> 10:41:51,540
You cannot travel to a site of grace right now.

8788
10:41:51,540 --> 10:41:52,540
Why not?

8789
10:41:58,540 --> 10:41:59,540
What have I done?

8790
10:41:59,540 --> 10:42:01,540
What have I done to deserve this fate?

8791
10:42:03,540 --> 10:42:05,540
Rest first. Okay rest.

8792
10:42:05,540 --> 10:42:06,540
You need to rest.

8793
10:42:06,540 --> 10:42:08,540
How did you know that?

8794
10:42:08,540 --> 10:42:09,540
Last time?

8795
10:42:09,540 --> 10:42:11,540
Yeah sure until it's on me.

8796
10:42:13,540 --> 10:42:14,540
Okay.

8797
10:42:15,540 --> 10:42:17,540
How did you know that?

8798
10:42:17,540 --> 10:42:19,540
That was very strange.

8799
10:42:19,540 --> 10:42:21,540
What was it? The church of the plague?

8800
10:42:21,540 --> 10:42:23,540
The church of the plague?

8801
10:42:27,540 --> 10:42:29,540
Caled, how are we so free?

8802
10:42:29,540 --> 10:42:31,540
Caled, how are we?

8803
10:42:33,540 --> 10:42:35,540
Smothering wall, Caled ruins.

8804
10:42:35,540 --> 10:42:37,540
I don't seem to have a lot of the...

8805
10:42:39,540 --> 10:42:40,540
Astray?

8806
10:42:40,540 --> 10:42:41,540
Astray?

8807
10:42:41,540 --> 10:42:43,540
Astray from Caled, how are we doing?

8808
10:42:47,540 --> 10:42:49,540
But yeah.

8809
10:42:49,540 --> 10:42:51,540
Tomorrow we'll finish the base game.

8810
10:42:51,540 --> 10:42:53,540
I can't believe I'm saying that after finishing the DLC.

8811
10:42:53,540 --> 10:42:54,540
But yeah we'll...

8812
10:42:54,540 --> 10:42:56,540
No no not that one, the other one.

8813
10:42:56,540 --> 10:42:58,540
No no, not that helper.

8814
10:42:58,540 --> 10:43:00,540
These helpers.

8815
10:43:01,540 --> 10:43:03,540
Okay there's no helpers.

8816
10:43:06,540 --> 10:43:08,540
Astray...

8817
10:43:08,540 --> 10:43:10,540
Has anyone able to play?

8818
10:43:10,540 --> 10:43:12,540
Is everyone asleep?

8819
10:43:12,540 --> 10:43:14,540
I willed it too hard all the refunds are asleep.

8820
10:43:14,540 --> 10:43:16,540
Astray from Caled, how are we?

8821
10:43:16,540 --> 10:43:18,540
Or is it only one?

8822
10:43:23,540 --> 10:43:25,540
Follow the path around the swamp

8823
10:43:25,540 --> 10:43:27,540
to the gates of the shack on the right?

8824
10:43:28,540 --> 10:43:30,540
I have to do this on my own.

8825
10:43:35,540 --> 10:43:37,540
Follow around the thing

8826
10:43:37,540 --> 10:43:39,540
and then there'll be a shack on the right.

8827
10:43:43,540 --> 10:43:45,540
This way?

8828
10:43:47,540 --> 10:43:49,540
No no, go sleep, rest well.

8829
10:43:51,540 --> 10:43:53,540
Thank you for hanging, go all the way to the right.

8830
10:43:54,540 --> 10:43:56,540
And a shack over here.

8831
10:43:57,540 --> 10:43:59,540
Big shack.

8832
10:43:59,540 --> 10:44:01,540
Are those flowers attacking me?

8833
10:44:05,540 --> 10:44:07,540
The sun's attacking me.

8834
10:44:07,540 --> 10:44:09,540
That's no fucking me.

8835
10:44:13,540 --> 10:44:15,540
I need to kill the commander.

8836
10:44:17,540 --> 10:44:19,540
There's a shack, oh I found a shack.

8837
10:44:19,540 --> 10:44:21,540
Big shack here, just won't talk about you.

8838
10:44:23,540 --> 10:44:25,540
I'd rather run down if I do say so myself.

8839
10:44:29,540 --> 10:44:31,540
I've got crab eggs.

8840
10:44:31,540 --> 10:44:33,540
Okay now that man at the shack won't.

8841
10:44:35,540 --> 10:44:37,540
Fine shack, spam talk to get every wrong shack.

8842
10:44:37,540 --> 10:44:39,540
Okay let's try again.

8843
10:44:39,540 --> 10:44:41,540
Please don't have a random dragon attack me.

8844
10:44:45,540 --> 10:44:47,540
Commander should be done first

8845
10:44:47,540 --> 10:44:49,540
if you want to skip one part of the quest.

8846
10:44:53,540 --> 10:44:55,540
I know where the shack is, oh it's clearly here.

8847
10:44:57,540 --> 10:44:59,540
By the smithing stones.

8848
10:45:05,540 --> 10:45:07,540
Is that attacking me?

8849
10:45:09,540 --> 10:45:11,540
The middle of the swamp?

8850
10:45:11,540 --> 10:45:13,540
Is where the commander, I can't open the map

8851
10:45:13,540 --> 10:45:15,540
because that thing's pretending to attack me.

8852
10:45:15,540 --> 10:45:17,540
Really?

8853
10:45:17,540 --> 10:45:19,540
Go away.

8854
10:45:19,540 --> 10:45:21,540
I assume this is the middle.

8855
10:45:21,540 --> 10:45:23,540
Are you the middle of the lake?

8856
10:45:27,540 --> 10:45:29,540
Are you the middle of the lake?

8857
10:45:33,540 --> 10:45:35,540
Something's coming out of the lake.

8858
10:45:35,540 --> 10:45:37,540
Naughty boy.

8859
10:45:37,540 --> 10:45:39,540
You're naughty yes you are.

8860
10:45:39,540 --> 10:45:41,540
Get out of here.

8861
10:45:41,540 --> 10:45:43,540
I want my reeflings and you stand in the way.

8862
10:45:45,540 --> 10:45:47,540
The shack is in the middle of the swamp.

8863
10:45:47,540 --> 10:45:49,540
Can I open up at now?

8864
10:45:49,540 --> 10:45:51,540
This?

8865
10:45:51,540 --> 10:45:53,540
The shack is in the middle of the swamp.

8866
10:45:53,540 --> 10:45:55,540
The shack is in the middle of the swamp.

8867
10:45:55,540 --> 10:45:57,540
Any swamp enthusiasts?

8868
10:45:59,540 --> 10:46:01,540
The shack is in the middle of the swamp.

8869
10:46:03,540 --> 10:46:05,540
By the way I'm comforting myself

8870
10:46:05,540 --> 10:46:07,540
when I say those words.

8871
10:46:07,540 --> 10:46:09,540
I am not mocking you

8872
10:46:09,540 --> 10:46:11,540
for telling me what to do.

8873
10:46:11,540 --> 10:46:13,540
I am comforting myself

8874
10:46:13,540 --> 10:46:15,540
because the shack is in the middle of the swamp.

8875
10:46:15,540 --> 10:46:17,540
Oh well.

8876
10:46:17,540 --> 10:46:19,540
I wasn't supposed to happen.

8877
10:46:19,540 --> 10:46:21,540
Can you piss off?

8878
10:46:21,540 --> 10:46:23,540
Why did you take me off my horse?

8879
10:46:25,540 --> 10:46:27,540
My listen?

8880
10:46:29,540 --> 10:46:31,540
Can you come up and fight me here?

8881
10:46:31,540 --> 10:46:33,540
Just so I don't get reticid?

8882
10:46:33,540 --> 10:46:35,540
Can you climb up?

8883
10:46:35,540 --> 10:46:37,540
Thank you.

8884
10:46:37,540 --> 10:46:39,540
Thanks I appreciate it bro.

8885
10:46:39,540 --> 10:46:41,540
No no.

8886
10:46:41,540 --> 10:46:43,540
It's all good.

8887
10:46:43,540 --> 10:46:45,540
Thanks bro, I appreciate it.

8888
10:46:45,540 --> 10:46:47,540
Can you come back up again?

8889
10:46:47,540 --> 10:46:49,540
You cheeky bitch!

8890
10:46:51,540 --> 10:46:53,540
You cheeky fuck.

8891
10:46:53,540 --> 10:46:55,540
Go to sleep.

8892
10:46:55,540 --> 10:46:57,540
Alright, okay.

8893
10:46:57,540 --> 10:46:59,540
Don't do that again.

8894
10:46:59,540 --> 10:47:01,540
Don't make me fight or mourn again.

8895
10:47:03,540 --> 10:47:05,540
Commander in Swamp Shack

8896
10:47:05,540 --> 10:47:07,540
is on the right of the path

8897
10:47:07,540 --> 10:47:09,540
past the giant

8898
10:47:09,540 --> 10:47:11,540
on Clifftop

8899
10:47:11,540 --> 10:47:13,540
past the hillhounds.

8900
10:47:17,540 --> 10:47:19,540
This?

8901
10:47:21,540 --> 10:47:23,540
Is it that guy?

8902
10:47:27,540 --> 10:47:29,540
Is it that guy?

8903
10:47:29,540 --> 10:47:31,540
I seem to recall something here.

8904
10:47:31,540 --> 10:47:33,540
Whoa! Ow ow ow!

8905
10:47:33,540 --> 10:47:35,540
Get me out of here.

8906
10:47:35,540 --> 10:47:37,540
I seem to recall

8907
10:47:37,540 --> 10:47:39,540
a strange man in a shack.

8908
10:47:39,540 --> 10:47:41,540
I'll piss off O'Neil, no one cares.

8909
10:47:45,540 --> 10:47:47,540
Ah jeez Louise,

8910
10:47:47,540 --> 10:47:49,540
can I get out of here?

8911
10:47:49,540 --> 10:47:51,540
Oh brother.

8912
10:47:51,540 --> 10:47:53,540
Yeah I know I'm in Caled.

8913
10:47:53,540 --> 10:47:55,540
Have you seen the place I'm in?

8914
10:47:57,540 --> 10:47:59,540
Of course I'm in Caled.

8915
10:47:59,540 --> 10:48:01,540
Alright follow the blue line.

8916
10:48:01,540 --> 10:48:03,540
Oh you need to kill that boss?

8917
10:48:03,540 --> 10:48:05,540
Oh for fuck's sake.

8918
10:48:05,540 --> 10:48:07,540
Alright alright alright alright

8919
10:48:07,540 --> 10:48:09,540
alright I'll go kill him.

8920
10:48:09,540 --> 10:48:11,540
I'm so strong

8921
10:48:11,540 --> 10:48:13,540
and I'm so

8922
10:48:13,540 --> 10:48:15,540
brave.

8923
10:48:15,540 --> 10:48:17,540
I am not afraid.

8924
10:48:17,540 --> 10:48:19,540
Where is he?

8925
10:48:19,540 --> 10:48:21,540
Are you O'Neil?

8926
10:48:21,540 --> 10:48:23,540
O'Neil?

8927
10:48:23,540 --> 10:48:25,540
O'Neil!

8928
10:48:25,540 --> 10:48:27,540
Where are you?

8929
10:48:27,540 --> 10:48:29,540
I've lost you.

8930
10:48:29,540 --> 10:48:31,540
Wait, what?

8931
10:48:31,540 --> 10:48:33,540
Did I just hear a Weflin symbol?

8932
10:48:33,540 --> 10:48:35,540
I did! What the fuck?

8933
10:48:35,540 --> 10:48:37,540
Why do you snipe me so well?

8934
10:48:37,540 --> 10:48:39,540
And you come?

8935
10:48:39,540 --> 10:48:41,540
Wait what?

8936
10:48:41,540 --> 10:48:43,540
You're an NPC, you're not a Weflin.

8937
10:48:45,540 --> 10:48:47,540
What do you help me fight?

8938
10:48:53,540 --> 10:48:55,540
Adopted daughter?

8939
10:48:55,540 --> 10:48:57,540
What do you do?

8940
10:48:59,540 --> 10:49:01,540
I need to go north.

8941
10:49:01,540 --> 10:49:03,540
Wait.

8942
10:49:03,540 --> 10:49:05,540
But you are a Weflin.

8943
10:49:05,540 --> 10:49:07,540
How the fuck are you sniping like that?

8944
10:49:07,540 --> 10:49:09,540
That's insane.

8945
10:49:09,540 --> 10:49:11,540
I'm like going like crazy all over the map.

8946
10:49:13,540 --> 10:49:15,540
This is a boss room?

8947
10:49:15,540 --> 10:49:17,540
Turn around?

8948
10:49:17,540 --> 10:49:19,540
What south?

8949
10:49:19,540 --> 10:49:21,540
Oh I found him!

8950
10:49:21,540 --> 10:49:23,540
I found him!

8951
10:49:23,540 --> 10:49:25,540
He's here. Oh I'm standing on the scarlet rock.

8952
10:49:25,540 --> 10:49:27,540
Sorry.

8953
10:49:27,540 --> 10:49:29,540
Yeah piece of ghost.

8954
10:49:31,540 --> 10:49:33,540
Oh I missed.

8955
10:49:35,540 --> 10:49:37,540
Whoa.

8956
10:49:37,540 --> 10:49:39,540
I'm at heals.

8957
10:49:39,540 --> 10:49:41,540
I'm at stamina, not heals. I've got 11 heals.

8958
10:49:41,540 --> 10:49:43,540
I've got enough heals to deal with her.

8959
10:49:43,540 --> 10:49:45,540
Oh my god.

8960
10:49:47,540 --> 10:49:49,540
Oh I'm getting scarlet rotted up.

8961
10:49:49,540 --> 10:49:51,540
Joint.

8962
10:49:53,540 --> 10:49:55,540
Oh she got a crit on him!

8963
10:49:55,540 --> 10:49:57,540
Oh I missed.

8964
10:49:57,540 --> 10:49:59,540
That was too late.

8965
10:49:59,540 --> 10:50:01,540
Oh my god.

8966
10:50:01,540 --> 10:50:03,540
Commander meal?

8967
10:50:03,540 --> 10:50:05,540
More like

8968
10:50:05,540 --> 10:50:07,540
commander

8969
10:50:07,540 --> 10:50:09,540
banana peel.

8970
10:50:09,540 --> 10:50:11,540
Cause you slipped and fell in your face and died instantly.

8971
10:50:13,540 --> 10:50:15,540
Okay and then now I go to the man?

8972
10:50:17,540 --> 10:50:19,540
I go to the man in the shack.

8973
10:50:19,540 --> 10:50:21,540
Oh did you leave me something?

8974
10:50:21,540 --> 10:50:23,540
What did you leave me?

8975
10:50:23,540 --> 10:50:25,540
Obsidian

8976
10:50:25,540 --> 10:50:27,540
What weapon is that?

8977
10:50:29,540 --> 10:50:31,540
An obsidian.

8978
10:50:31,540 --> 10:50:33,540
I can hardly hold anything you guys are gifting me.

8979
10:50:35,540 --> 10:50:37,540
I'm just so small and cute and oo-woo.

8980
10:50:37,540 --> 10:50:39,540
And it's totally not because I've not

8981
10:50:39,540 --> 10:50:41,540
levelled up these particular attributes.

8982
10:50:41,540 --> 10:50:43,540
Oo-woo.

8983
10:50:45,540 --> 10:50:47,540
Big check.

8984
10:50:51,540 --> 10:50:53,540
Okay now I speak to the man.

8985
10:50:53,540 --> 10:50:55,540
Hello I would like to be cured of the frenzied flame

8986
10:50:55,540 --> 10:50:57,540
and I know you know how to do it.

8987
10:50:57,540 --> 10:50:59,540
So let's not beat around the bush.

8988
10:50:59,540 --> 10:51:01,540
So your little guard dog doesn't scare me.

8989
10:51:01,540 --> 10:51:03,540
Fuck you.

8990
10:51:03,540 --> 10:51:05,540
See that? Shit guard dog, you need a new one.

8991
10:51:05,540 --> 10:51:07,540
I remember that dog cause it scared me.

8992
10:51:11,540 --> 10:51:13,540
The way he's sitting.

8993
10:51:13,540 --> 10:51:15,540
Are you okay?

8994
10:51:17,540 --> 10:51:19,540
Gary.

8995
10:51:23,540 --> 10:51:25,540
My ilk?

8996
10:51:25,540 --> 10:51:27,540
What is an ilk?

8997
10:51:35,540 --> 10:51:37,540
Boom.

8998
10:51:41,540 --> 10:51:43,540
Okay.

8999
10:51:43,540 --> 10:51:45,540
Here are the requests.

9000
10:51:45,540 --> 10:51:47,540
Your ilk.

9001
10:51:47,540 --> 10:51:49,540
Your cane. Your level.

9002
10:51:51,540 --> 10:51:53,540
It's Sir Albert's weapon

9003
10:51:53,540 --> 10:51:55,540
that gets you a quest lane.

9004
10:51:55,540 --> 10:51:57,540
It has two so I figured to give you the second one.

9005
10:51:57,540 --> 10:51:59,540
Oh!

9006
10:51:59,540 --> 10:52:01,540

9009
10:52:17,540 --> 10:52:19,540
Okay I'll just summon you cause I don't know what I'm doing.

9010
10:52:19,540 --> 10:52:21,540
Oh!

9011
10:52:21,540 --> 10:52:23,540

9012
10:52:27,540 --> 10:52:29,540
Don't summon.

9013
10:52:29,540 --> 10:52:31,540
Oh shit.

9014
10:52:33,540 --> 10:52:35,540
You'll need to reload the area.

9015
10:52:41,540 --> 10:52:43,540
Sorry Phoenix.

9016
10:52:43,540 --> 10:52:45,540
Well thank you for the de-spawn.

9017
10:52:49,540 --> 10:52:51,540
That old craftsman

9018
10:52:51,540 --> 10:52:53,540
who grasps the essence of life.

9019
10:52:53,540 --> 10:52:55,540

9020
10:52:55,540 --> 10:52:57,540

9021
10:53:01,540 --> 10:53:03,540
No.

9022
10:53:03,540 --> 10:53:05,540
Can you give me some time with this?

9023
10:53:05,540 --> 10:53:07,540
As well made as it is.

9024
10:53:11,540 --> 10:53:13,540
Okay so now that he says snap in half

9025
10:53:13,540 --> 10:53:15,540

9026
10:53:15,540 --> 10:53:17,540
Like come back to him.

9027
10:53:19,540 --> 10:53:21,540
To the tail menu?

9028
10:53:25,540 --> 10:53:27,540

9029
10:53:27,540 --> 10:53:29,540

10:53:39,540 --> 10:53:41,540
Dropped it before I realized she was gonna

9033
10:53:41,540 --> 10:53:43,540
play it with her.

9034
10:53:43,540 --> 10:53:45,540
Okay now he's giving me new dialogue.

9035
10:53:49,540 --> 10:53:51,540
Give me dialogue now.

9036
10:53:51,540 --> 10:53:53,540
Hello! New dialogue please.

Yes yes.

9038
10:54:09,540 --> 10:54:11,540
Okay now what to do with the needle?

9039
10:54:13,540 --> 10:54:15,540
After this travel to the church of the plague.

9040
10:54:33,540 --> 10:54:35,540
Church of the plague.

9041
10:54:39,540 --> 10:54:41,540
Oh!

9042
10:54:41,540 --> 10:54:43,540
Are you alright bestie?

9043
10:54:43,540 --> 10:54:45,540
God damn you some fuck up.

9044
10:54:49,540 --> 10:54:51,540
Actually I have something for you.

9045
10:54:53,540 --> 10:54:55,540
Give the alloyed needle.

9046
10:54:57,540 --> 10:54:59,540
An alloyed guild needle.

9047
10:54:59,540 --> 10:55:01,540
Give her that needle then rest.

9048
10:55:05,540 --> 10:55:07,540
Yeah go for it.

9049
10:55:07,540 --> 10:55:09,540
Yeah sure.

9050
10:55:09,540 --> 10:55:11,540
I don't know magic or something.

9051
10:55:11,540 --> 10:55:13,540
I don't know it's just the lore.

9052
10:55:13,540 --> 10:55:15,540
Okay don't question Elden Ring lore.

9053
10:55:15,540 --> 10:55:17,540
It's too difficult.

9054
10:55:25,540 --> 10:55:27,540
Yeah sure sorry.

9055
10:55:33,540 --> 10:55:35,540
It's a video game.

9056
10:55:35,540 --> 10:55:37,540
It's not me.

9057
10:55:39,540 --> 10:55:41,540
Well that was easier than expected.

9058
10:55:45,540 --> 10:55:47,540
But why do I feel so...

9059
10:55:47,540 --> 10:55:49,540
So what?

9060
10:55:51,540 --> 10:55:53,540
Is she okay?

9061
10:55:53,540 --> 10:55:55,540
I think I made her worse.

9062
10:55:57,540 --> 10:55:59,540
I would like to pass the time until morning.

9063
10:56:03,540 --> 10:56:05,540
Oh you're standing.

9064
10:56:05,540 --> 10:56:07,540
How do you feel?

9065
10:56:07,540 --> 10:56:09,540
Hi.

9066
10:56:09,540 --> 10:56:11,540
I hope to see you again.

9067
10:56:11,540 --> 10:56:13,540
Hi.

9068
10:56:13,540 --> 10:56:15,540
For when last we met.

9069
10:56:15,540 --> 10:56:17,540
I fainted before I could even thank you.

9070
10:56:17,540 --> 10:56:19,540
Everything is as you said.

9071
10:56:19,540 --> 10:56:21,540
Since inserting the needle

9072
10:56:21,540 --> 10:56:23,540
with scarlet rot

9073
10:56:23,540 --> 10:56:25,540
has ceased to ride.

9074
10:56:25,540 --> 10:56:27,540
Even the nightmares have abated.

9075
10:56:27,540 --> 10:56:29,540
And now

9076
10:56:29,540 --> 10:56:31,540
though I can scarcely believe it myself.

9077
10:56:33,540 --> 10:56:35,540
I can move as I please.

9078
10:56:35,540 --> 10:56:37,540
Not that I could ever truly repay you.

9079
10:56:37,540 --> 10:56:39,540
I would like you to have this.

9080
10:56:41,540 --> 10:56:43,540
By way of thanks.

9081
10:56:43,540 --> 10:56:45,540
Try arms but you don't have the right...

9082
10:56:53,540 --> 10:56:55,540
After this dialogue rest at the grace

9083
10:56:55,540 --> 10:56:57,540
and then go back to the shack.

9084
10:57:01,540 --> 10:57:03,540
Time for the shack.

9085
10:57:05,540 --> 10:57:07,540
It's not raining today.

9086
10:57:07,540 --> 10:57:09,540
Oh shit she gone.

9087
10:57:09,540 --> 10:57:11,540
Oh right.

9088
10:57:11,540 --> 10:57:13,540
You can't just teleport to the shack.

9089
10:57:13,540 --> 10:57:15,540
I rageous have to

9090
10:57:15,540 --> 10:57:17,540
actually walk a little bit

9091
10:57:17,540 --> 10:57:19,540
in this game.

9092
10:57:19,540 --> 10:57:21,540
Am I going the right way?

9093
10:57:21,540 --> 10:57:23,540
Yeah yeah yeah.

9094
10:57:23,540 --> 10:57:25,540
Like down this.

9095
10:57:25,540 --> 10:57:27,540
Are you squinting me right now?

9096
10:57:29,540 --> 10:57:31,540
I give to go sailing for a couple of days soon.

9097
10:57:31,540 --> 10:57:33,540
Yeah?

9098
10:57:33,540 --> 10:57:35,540
Time sailing without anyone else around.

9099
10:57:35,540 --> 10:57:37,540
I am really looking forward to it.

9100
10:57:37,540 --> 10:57:39,540
Make sure you have the safety precautions alright?

9101
10:57:39,540 --> 10:57:41,540
Like

9102
10:57:41,540 --> 10:57:43,540
the tracker thing

9103
10:57:43,540 --> 10:57:45,540
and it like pings your location

9104
10:57:45,540 --> 10:57:47,540
at someone and stuff. Right last rabbit?

9105
10:57:47,540 --> 10:57:49,540
Thank you for the super chat.

9106
10:57:49,540 --> 10:57:51,540
But you got the safety precautions right?

9107
10:57:51,540 --> 10:57:53,540
Don't make me nervous.

9108
10:57:53,540 --> 10:57:55,540
I'll cry.

9109
10:57:55,540 --> 10:57:57,540
You are doing the safety stuff right?

9110
10:57:59,540 --> 10:58:01,540
Whoa whoa whoa!

9111
10:58:01,540 --> 10:58:03,540
Now give me the fuck out of here.

9112
10:58:03,540 --> 10:58:05,540
How did I go down?

9113
10:58:07,540 --> 10:58:09,540
Is there a way down?

9114
10:58:11,540 --> 10:58:13,540
What's the fuck? How do I go down?

9115
10:58:13,540 --> 10:58:15,540
Oh here we go.

9116
10:58:17,540 --> 10:58:19,540
Be safe when you sail.

9117
10:58:21,540 --> 10:58:23,540
Excuse me Mr. B.

9118
10:58:27,540 --> 10:58:29,540
Apparently you killed...

9119
10:58:29,540 --> 10:58:31,540
What? I killed it like half an hour ago?

9120
10:58:33,540 --> 10:58:35,540
Silly.

9121
10:58:37,540 --> 10:58:39,540
If you just teleport to this one.

9122
10:58:39,540 --> 10:58:41,540
Probably.

9123
10:58:41,540 --> 10:58:43,540
I hope you have fun though.

9124
10:58:43,540 --> 10:58:45,540
But definitely be safe.

9125
10:58:45,540 --> 10:58:47,540
Make sure someone got your

9126
10:58:47,540 --> 10:58:49,540
location. I think they have those GPS

9127
10:58:49,540 --> 10:58:51,540
tracker things.

9128
10:58:51,540 --> 10:58:53,540
Oh here. Oh the guy is gone now.

9129
10:58:53,540 --> 10:58:55,540
What's up hen?

9130
10:58:55,540 --> 10:58:57,540
Hello again.

9131
10:58:57,540 --> 10:58:59,540
My butt cheeks are sore.

9132
10:59:03,540 --> 10:59:05,540
Oh but he's not here.

9133
10:59:13,540 --> 10:59:15,540
Okay good. We got a safety thing.

9134
10:59:15,540 --> 10:59:17,540
I'm happy. Okay I hope you enjoy your sail

9135
10:59:17,540 --> 10:59:19,540
and last rabbit. Thank you again for the tip.

9136
10:59:19,540 --> 10:59:21,540
Exhaust her dialogue.

9137
10:59:23,540 --> 10:59:25,540
I'll massage her for you mummy.

9138
10:59:25,540 --> 10:59:27,540
I like so fucking sore.

9139
10:59:31,540 --> 10:59:33,540
Yeah you're gonna stay strong.

9140
10:59:37,540 --> 10:59:39,540
Okay she wants to stay strong.

9141
10:59:39,540 --> 10:59:41,540
After this go

9142
10:59:41,540 --> 10:59:43,540
to a place near Stargate's

9143
10:59:43,540 --> 10:59:45,540
hill site of grace.

9144
10:59:47,540 --> 10:59:49,540
Which is Kaelit?

9145
10:59:51,540 --> 10:59:53,540
Cheese is sore but I don't know

9146
10:59:53,540 --> 10:59:55,540
what it is.

9147
10:59:55,540 --> 10:59:57,540
Altus plateau.

9148
10:59:57,540 --> 10:59:59,540
Is that the underground map

9149
10:59:59,540 --> 11:00:01,540
thingy my bobber?

9150
11:00:03,540 --> 11:00:05,540
Erd tree grazing hill site of

9151
11:00:05,540 --> 11:00:07,540
grace in Altus.

9152
11:00:07,540 --> 11:00:09,540
We've got about 50 minutes left.

9153
11:00:09,540 --> 11:00:11,540
North? Here?

9154
11:00:11,540 --> 11:00:13,540
No it's not Altus.

9155
11:00:13,540 --> 11:00:15,540
Oh wait wait wait this?

9156
11:00:15,540 --> 11:00:17,540
No.

9157
11:00:17,540 --> 11:00:19,540
West of

9158
11:00:21,540 --> 11:00:23,540
Lindell.

9159
11:00:27,540 --> 11:00:29,540
Erd one of these ones.

9160
11:00:29,540 --> 11:00:31,540
Altus plateau.

9161
11:00:31,540 --> 11:00:33,540
For Vinlands.

9162
11:00:33,540 --> 11:00:35,540
Ba ba ba ba ba.

9163
11:00:35,540 --> 11:00:37,540
Harrow wall, hermit shark.

9164
11:00:37,540 --> 11:00:39,540
That's one of these genes isn't it?

9165
11:00:39,540 --> 11:00:41,540
We Altus.

9166
11:00:41,540 --> 11:00:43,540
We Altus.

9167
11:00:45,540 --> 11:00:47,540
What the fuck is it?

9168
11:00:47,540 --> 11:00:49,540
Capital rampart?

9169
11:00:49,540 --> 11:00:51,540
Where the fuck is it? It's here.

9170
11:00:51,540 --> 11:00:53,540
You, you, no Avenue balcony.

9171
11:00:53,540 --> 11:00:55,540
Shit.

9172
11:00:55,540 --> 11:00:57,540
And the other shadowy part of the map?

9173
11:01:01,540 --> 11:01:03,540
Where? You have

9174
11:01:03,540 --> 11:01:05,540
you have the Altus highway junction?

9175
11:01:07,540 --> 11:01:09,540
Where is it?

9176
11:01:09,540 --> 11:01:11,540
Where is it?

9177
11:01:11,540 --> 11:01:13,540
Bro this must be so annoying.

9178
11:01:13,540 --> 11:01:15,540
More to the left, okay.

9179
11:01:17,540 --> 11:01:19,540
These are water.

9180
11:01:21,540 --> 11:01:23,540
I have the windmill.

9181
11:01:23,540 --> 11:01:25,540
Outer wall battle. Outer wall fountain tree.

9182
11:01:27,540 --> 11:01:29,540
I'm still going strong after 10 hours.

9183
11:01:31,540 --> 11:01:33,540
Abandoned coffin.

9184
11:01:33,540 --> 11:01:35,540
I'll get there.

9185
11:01:35,540 --> 11:01:37,540
I'm getting close.

9186
11:01:37,540 --> 11:01:39,540
I'm getting warmer.

9187
11:01:39,540 --> 11:01:41,540
I'm just getting warmer.

9188
11:01:41,540 --> 11:01:43,540
Altus.

9189
11:01:43,540 --> 11:01:45,540
What the fuck is it?

9190
11:01:45,540 --> 11:01:47,540
You're just on an urge tree grazing hill?

9191
11:01:49,540 --> 11:01:51,540
This?

9192
11:01:53,540 --> 11:01:55,540
I like making you work right?

9193
11:01:55,540 --> 11:01:57,540
See how worked up and frustrated you're getting

9194
11:01:57,540 --> 11:01:59,540
when I was edging over it?

9195
11:01:59,540 --> 11:02:01,540
Yeah that's what I'm gonna do to you tonight.

9196
11:02:01,540 --> 11:02:03,540
I'm gonna fuck you up.

9197
11:02:03,540 --> 11:02:05,540
Right what do I do here?

9198
11:02:07,540 --> 11:02:09,540
I don't know what to do here.

9199
11:02:11,540 --> 11:02:13,540
Up the hill. Up the hill.

9200
11:02:13,540 --> 11:02:15,540
Did I just go on my horse?

9201
11:02:17,540 --> 11:02:19,540
Maybe a refling gate?

9202
11:02:19,540 --> 11:02:21,540
You don't have to fucking tell me

9203
11:02:21,540 --> 11:02:23,540
to ice tingling.

9204
11:02:23,540 --> 11:02:25,540
I'm in.

9205
11:02:25,540 --> 11:02:27,540
Enemy refling.

9206
11:02:27,540 --> 11:02:29,540
Shlumpling.

9207
11:02:29,540 --> 11:02:31,540
Shlumpling.

9208
11:02:31,540 --> 11:02:33,540
Shlumpling.

9209
11:02:33,540 --> 11:02:35,540
Shlumpling.

9210
11:02:35,540 --> 11:02:37,540
I've got an enemy.

9211
11:02:37,540 --> 11:02:39,540
Am I not allowed to eat nice reflings?

9212
11:02:41,540 --> 11:02:43,540
It's called me a cliff because I'd be edging.

9213
11:02:45,540 --> 11:02:47,540
I'd click victims for everything in the way.

9214
11:02:47,540 --> 11:02:49,540
I've got my baggage reels in the way.

9215
11:02:49,540 --> 11:02:51,540
Hydration check.

9216
11:02:53,540 --> 11:02:55,540
I'm gonna stop at the VOD limit

9217
11:02:55,540 --> 11:02:57,540
and we'll finish it tomorrow.

9218
11:02:57,540 --> 11:02:59,540
What that means is

9219
11:02:59,540 --> 11:03:01,540
Monday originally was gonna be Elden Ring

9220
11:03:01,540 --> 11:03:03,540
but I didn't realise how

9221
11:03:03,540 --> 11:03:05,540
how much you guys

9222
11:03:05,540 --> 11:03:07,540
were gonna carry me through the game.

9223
11:03:07,540 --> 11:03:09,540
Oh no I can't have a wholesome refling.

9224
11:03:11,540 --> 11:03:13,540
Have a well behaved boy.

9225
11:03:17,540 --> 11:03:19,540
Monday originally was gonna be Elden Ring

9226
11:03:19,540 --> 11:03:21,540
but it's not. I'll get swapped out now.

9227
11:03:23,540 --> 11:03:25,540
There's water and whiskey right?

9228
11:03:25,540 --> 11:03:27,540
Yes there's technically.

9229
11:03:27,540 --> 11:03:29,540
Are you getting steaming?

9230
11:03:29,540 --> 11:03:31,540
I'm coming, I'm coming.

9231
11:03:31,540 --> 11:03:33,540
Give me a minute.

9232
11:03:33,540 --> 11:03:35,540
I'm spawning in reflings.

9233
11:03:35,540 --> 11:03:37,540
You're still impatient.

9234
11:03:37,540 --> 11:03:39,540
Mister.

9235
11:03:39,540 --> 11:03:41,540
Okay, I don't see any other marks

9236
11:03:41,540 --> 11:03:43,540
so I guess that's it.

9237
11:03:43,540 --> 11:03:45,540
I don't know.

9238
11:03:45,540 --> 11:03:47,540
It may not be working so well

9239
11:03:47,540 --> 11:03:49,540
especially because of how long the incense

9240
11:03:49,540 --> 11:03:51,540
is going on.

9241
11:03:51,540 --> 11:03:53,540
I wish I had a pizza.

9242
11:03:53,540 --> 11:03:55,540
Oh hello.

9243
11:03:55,540 --> 11:03:57,540
We're doing it again.

9244
11:03:57,540 --> 11:03:59,540
We're doing it again.

9245
11:03:59,540 --> 11:04:01,540
Yes, you feel better.

9246
11:04:03,540 --> 11:04:05,540
Yeah, yeah.

9247
11:04:15,540 --> 11:04:17,540
I saw it.

9248
11:04:17,540 --> 11:04:19,540
Thank you.

9249
11:04:19,540 --> 11:04:21,540
Thank you.

9250
11:04:25,540 --> 11:04:27,540
Mm-hmm.

9251
11:04:31,540 --> 11:04:33,540
Oh sorry.

9252
11:04:35,540 --> 11:04:37,540
Wait, does she want to perish her?

9253
11:04:37,540 --> 11:04:39,540
Because of the scarlet well?

9254
11:04:39,540 --> 11:04:41,540
Okay, baby.

9255
11:04:41,540 --> 11:04:43,540
Why are you looking at her?

9256
11:04:43,540 --> 11:04:45,540
Where are we going now?

9257
11:04:51,540 --> 11:04:53,540
After this dialogue you'll need to make your way

9258
11:04:53,540 --> 11:04:55,540
to a poison castle

9259
11:04:55,540 --> 11:04:57,540
and get an armed prosthesis for her.

9260
11:04:57,540 --> 11:04:59,540
I too enjoy good prosthesis.

9261
11:04:59,540 --> 11:05:01,540
Perhaps even

9262
11:05:01,540 --> 11:05:03,540
some sort of chicken nugget prosthesis

9263
11:05:03,540 --> 11:05:05,540
will do just fine.

9264
11:05:07,540 --> 11:05:09,540
How do we feel

9265
11:05:09,540 --> 11:05:11,540
about the level of chicken nugget

9266
11:05:11,540 --> 11:05:13,540
that NPC is?

9267
11:05:13,540 --> 11:05:15,540
Should she be more

9268
11:05:15,540 --> 11:05:17,540
or less of a chicken nugget?

9269
11:05:17,540 --> 11:05:19,540
Where did you just go?

9270
11:05:19,540 --> 11:05:21,540
Oh, sorry.

9271
11:05:21,540 --> 11:05:23,540
For no particular reason

9272
11:05:23,540 --> 11:05:25,540
I will inquire about this.

9273
11:05:25,540 --> 11:05:27,540
How long does stream have left?

9274
11:05:27,540 --> 11:05:29,540
Very unfortunately

9275
11:05:29,540 --> 11:05:31,540
less than 50 minutes.

9276
11:05:31,540 --> 11:05:33,540
So we are playing Elden Ring Tomorrow base game.

9277
11:05:35,540 --> 11:05:37,540
Oh yeah, piss.

9278
11:05:37,540 --> 11:05:39,540
No, I'm no dealing with that.

9279
11:05:39,540 --> 11:05:41,540
That's not my problem.

9280
11:05:43,540 --> 11:05:45,540
One can always be more of a chicken nugget.

9281
11:05:47,540 --> 11:05:49,540
Oh, well that refland said

9282
11:05:49,540 --> 11:05:51,540
excuse me.

9283
11:05:55,540 --> 11:05:57,540
Candy.

9284
11:06:05,540 --> 11:06:07,540
What are you?

9285
11:06:07,540 --> 11:06:09,540
That certainly doesn't look friendly.

9286
11:06:11,540 --> 11:06:13,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, get fucked.

9287
11:06:13,540 --> 11:06:15,540
You're scaring me.

9288
11:06:19,540 --> 11:06:21,540
Where did he come from?

9289
11:06:21,540 --> 11:06:23,540
Did he jump up?

9290
11:06:23,540 --> 11:06:25,540
Oh my god, where did I go?

9291
11:06:25,540 --> 11:06:27,540
I'm scared.

9292
11:06:27,540 --> 11:06:29,540
Oh, are you going to be okay?

9293
11:06:29,540 --> 11:06:31,540
Okay, we're okay.

9294
11:06:31,540 --> 11:06:33,540
Follow the refland following.

9295
11:06:33,540 --> 11:06:35,540
The refland, the refland, the refland.

9296
11:06:35,540 --> 11:06:37,540
If it's a boy, are they a chicken tender?

9297
11:06:37,540 --> 11:06:39,540
How do you feel about a chicken nugget?

9298
11:06:39,540 --> 11:06:41,540
If...

9299
11:06:41,540 --> 11:06:43,540
Whoa, that thing can move.

9300
11:06:43,540 --> 11:06:45,540
Do you need assistance?

9301
11:06:45,540 --> 11:06:47,540
Hold on.

9302
11:06:49,540 --> 11:06:51,540
Okay, he got an ultimate hit.

9303
11:06:57,540 --> 11:06:59,540
Maybe a chicken tender.

9304
11:06:59,540 --> 11:07:01,540
Maybe a chicken tender.

9305
11:07:13,540 --> 11:07:15,540
Okay, right, no more chicken nuggets.

9306
11:07:15,540 --> 11:07:17,540
I'm going to run out.

9307
11:07:21,540 --> 11:07:23,540
That's right, that's right.

9308
11:07:23,540 --> 11:07:25,540
I bring it up, but then I say no, no, no more.

9309
11:07:25,540 --> 11:07:27,540
Bad refland.

9310
11:07:27,540 --> 11:07:29,540
Are you a machine?

9311
11:07:29,540 --> 11:07:31,540
Not just like playing games with you.

9312
11:07:33,540 --> 11:07:35,540
Oh, Castello, I'm getting a memory.

9313
11:07:37,540 --> 11:07:39,540
I'm getting a memory of being

9314
11:07:39,540 --> 11:07:41,540
taking around all sorts of locations

9315
11:07:41,540 --> 11:07:43,540
in this castle.

9316
11:07:45,540 --> 11:07:47,540
I'm getting a distant memory

9317
11:07:47,540 --> 11:07:49,540
of being carried through this area.

9318
11:07:49,540 --> 11:07:51,540
I'm being carried through this area.

9319
11:07:57,540 --> 11:07:59,540
Oh, how...

9320
11:07:59,540 --> 11:08:01,540
Oh, this refland found it.

9321
11:08:03,540 --> 11:08:05,540
Oh, how history repeats itself

9322
11:08:05,540 --> 11:08:07,540
in a good way.

9323
11:08:07,540 --> 11:08:09,540
Okay, this is the entrance.

9324
11:08:11,540 --> 11:08:13,540
Naughty.

9325
11:08:13,540 --> 11:08:15,540
Beholds.

9326
11:08:15,540 --> 11:08:17,540
Ah, Gracie!

9327
11:08:17,540 --> 11:08:19,540
Gracie?

9328
11:08:19,540 --> 11:08:21,540
A fried chicken?

9329
11:08:23,540 --> 11:08:25,540
Prosthesis is in a chest

9330
11:08:25,540 --> 11:08:27,540
behind a clear rot night.

9331
11:08:29,540 --> 11:08:31,540
I think I killed shaded castle rampant.

9332
11:08:33,540 --> 11:08:35,540
Okay, calm down.

9333
11:08:35,540 --> 11:08:37,540
Sweet chariot.

9334
11:08:39,540 --> 11:08:41,540
Coming for to carry on.

9335
11:08:41,540 --> 11:08:43,540
Come on.

9336
11:08:57,540 --> 11:08:59,540
My voice is really starting to hurt.

9337
11:08:59,540 --> 11:09:01,540
I'm so sorry.

9338
11:09:01,540 --> 11:09:03,540
I'm trying to not talk

9339
11:09:03,540 --> 11:09:05,540
at the same time.

9340
11:09:05,540 --> 11:09:07,540
Is it blabbermouth?

9341
11:09:07,540 --> 11:09:09,540
I'm such a blabbermouth.

9342
11:09:11,540 --> 11:09:13,540
Hmm.

9343
11:09:13,540 --> 11:09:15,540
I appreciate the community.

9344
11:09:15,540 --> 11:09:17,540
My refland.

9345
11:09:17,540 --> 11:09:19,540
Oh, yeah.

9346
11:09:19,540 --> 11:09:21,540
Thank you, refland.

9347
11:09:21,540 --> 11:09:23,540
Oh, whoa, sorry.

9348
11:09:23,540 --> 11:09:25,540
Sorry, too busy getting my ego stroke

9349
11:09:25,540 --> 11:09:27,540
there to see the anime.

9350
11:09:27,540 --> 11:09:29,540
Alright, we're going to take a lift.

9351
11:09:29,540 --> 11:09:31,540
We love your blabbering.

9352
11:09:31,540 --> 11:09:33,540
If I could get my audio to not peak,

9353
11:09:33,540 --> 11:09:35,540
then I would save my streams

9354
11:09:35,540 --> 11:09:37,540
or like peak, like falling asleep stuff.

9355
11:09:37,540 --> 11:09:39,540
But...

9356
11:09:39,540 --> 11:09:41,540
Yeah, no, it's when I...

9357
11:09:41,540 --> 11:09:43,540
I just want to get a little bit...

9358
11:09:45,540 --> 11:09:47,540
Okay, so there's an enemy up ahead.

9359
11:09:47,540 --> 11:09:49,540
Got it.

9360
11:09:49,540 --> 11:09:51,540
This?

9361
11:09:51,540 --> 11:09:53,540
Go to sleep.

9362
11:09:53,540 --> 11:09:55,540
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

9363
11:09:55,540 --> 11:09:57,540
Close enough.

9364
11:09:57,540 --> 11:09:59,540
Oh!

9365
11:09:59,540 --> 11:10:01,540
I've been impaled by the scarlet reticcy.

9366
11:10:01,540 --> 11:10:03,540
Hold on.

9367
11:10:03,540 --> 11:10:05,540
I'll let you finish them off.

9368
11:10:05,540 --> 11:10:07,540
If I can scarlet rot, scarlet rot.

9369
11:10:07,540 --> 11:10:09,540
Yes, please.

9370
11:10:09,540 --> 11:10:11,540
Jeez.

9371
11:10:11,540 --> 11:10:13,540
What's that?

9372
11:10:13,540 --> 11:10:15,540
It's creed.

9373
11:10:15,540 --> 11:10:17,540
It heals?

9374
11:10:17,540 --> 11:10:19,540
What is it? Oh, it must heal.

9375
11:10:19,540 --> 11:10:21,540
Hmm, I feel it inside me.

9376
11:10:27,540 --> 11:10:29,540
I'm healing. I'm healing.

9377
11:10:29,540 --> 11:10:31,540
Whoa!

9378
11:10:31,540 --> 11:10:33,540
You're a bird all along?

9379
11:10:33,540 --> 11:10:35,540
Flying.

9380
11:10:35,540 --> 11:10:37,540
Hello!

9381
11:10:37,540 --> 11:10:39,540
Oh!

9382
11:10:39,540 --> 11:10:41,540
Okay, we got the arm.

9383
11:10:41,540 --> 11:10:43,540
Then I teleport back to her.

9384
11:10:43,540 --> 11:10:45,540
Or are we just manually walking?

9385
11:10:47,540 --> 11:10:49,540
After getting the arm,

9386
11:10:49,540 --> 11:10:51,540
go back to where you found her before

9387
11:10:51,540 --> 11:10:53,540
and get her the arm.

9388
11:10:53,540 --> 11:10:55,540
But in the field, right?

9389
11:10:55,540 --> 11:10:57,540
Not like back at the

9390
11:10:57,540 --> 11:10:59,540
church where we

9391
11:10:59,540 --> 11:11:01,540
found her all mangled and stuff

9392
11:11:01,540 --> 11:11:03,540
and really keeping her alive because they were...

9393
11:11:03,540 --> 11:11:05,540
I don't know, they were preying the rot

9394
11:11:05,540 --> 11:11:07,540
inside of her?

9395
11:11:07,540 --> 11:11:09,540
I'm not sure.

9396
11:11:09,540 --> 11:11:11,540
Okay, hold on.

9397
11:11:11,540 --> 11:11:13,540
Uh...

9398
11:11:13,540 --> 11:11:15,540
Okay, okay.

9399
11:11:15,540 --> 11:11:17,540
Okay!

9400
11:11:17,540 --> 11:11:19,540
Wee!

9401
11:11:19,540 --> 11:11:21,540
Hmm, Danny, if I...

9402
11:11:21,540 --> 11:11:23,540
Kind of looks like a...

9403
11:11:23,540 --> 11:11:25,540
Okay, that was a terrible miss.

9404
11:11:25,540 --> 11:11:27,540
A swing in a miss!

9405
11:11:27,540 --> 11:11:29,540
Whoa!

9406
11:11:31,540 --> 11:11:33,540
Alright, get off that

9407
11:11:33,540 --> 11:11:35,540
fucking high horse. Jesus.

9408
11:11:35,540 --> 11:11:37,540
Right now, I'm out.

9409
11:11:37,540 --> 11:11:39,540
I'm skipping. I'm skipping.

9410
11:11:39,540 --> 11:11:41,540
Why are you moving?

9411
11:11:41,540 --> 11:11:43,540
Why is it so slow? Am I being trolled right now?

9412
11:11:43,540 --> 11:11:45,540
Why is that so slow?

9413
11:11:47,540 --> 11:11:49,540
I mean, I didn't get poisoned.

9414
11:11:51,540 --> 11:11:53,540
Oh yeah, piss.

9415
11:11:53,540 --> 11:11:55,540
Are we supposed to do this?

9416
11:11:55,540 --> 11:11:57,540
Are we supposed to do this?

9417
11:11:59,540 --> 11:12:01,540
Okay.

9418
11:12:01,540 --> 11:12:03,540
Whoa, that was a good one.

9419
11:12:03,540 --> 11:12:05,540
That was a good one.

9420
11:12:05,540 --> 11:12:07,540
Good attack, good attack.

9421
11:12:07,540 --> 11:12:09,540
What is this?

9422
11:12:09,540 --> 11:12:11,540
I have an item.

9423
11:12:11,540 --> 11:12:13,540
Rotgris.

9424
11:12:13,540 --> 11:12:15,540
You tried running in knee deep surge.

9425
11:12:15,540 --> 11:12:17,540
Oh!

9426
11:12:17,540 --> 11:12:19,540
You tried running in knee. It was Lucy's idea.

9427
11:12:19,540 --> 11:12:21,540
Oh!

9428
11:12:21,540 --> 11:12:23,540
He's getting dragged off it.

9429
11:12:23,540 --> 11:12:25,540
Oh, he's getting beaten the fuck up.

9430
11:12:25,540 --> 11:12:27,540
They said, nah, we're not letting you escape.

9431
11:12:27,540 --> 11:12:29,540
You entered the space window.

9432
11:12:35,540 --> 11:12:37,540
I can't open up the map

9433
11:12:37,540 --> 11:12:39,540
to show you where I am.

9434
11:12:39,540 --> 11:12:41,540
To call in a new reflim.

9435
11:12:41,540 --> 11:12:43,540
No working.

9436
11:12:43,540 --> 11:12:45,540
Whoa!

9437
11:12:45,540 --> 11:12:47,540
You scared me.

9438
11:12:47,540 --> 11:12:49,540
Wow!

9439
11:12:49,540 --> 11:12:51,540
You scared me.

9440
11:12:53,540 --> 11:12:55,540
They're not going to talk to you.

9441
11:12:55,540 --> 11:12:57,540
Hello.

9442
11:12:57,540 --> 11:12:59,540
How's Marias is ruined?

9443
11:12:59,540 --> 11:13:01,540
Just deserts for

9444
11:13:03,540 --> 11:13:05,540
falling for the severed harpy.

9445
11:13:05,540 --> 11:13:07,540
No surprise that Gilly Cretan took the castle

9446
11:13:07,540 --> 11:13:09,540
and her

9447
11:13:09,540 --> 11:13:11,540
storied sword.

9448
11:13:13,540 --> 11:13:15,540
Okay, okay, okay.

9449
11:13:15,540 --> 11:13:17,540
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

9450
11:13:17,540 --> 11:13:19,540
You're too quick for me.

9451
11:13:19,540 --> 11:13:21,540
You're too quick for me.

9452
11:13:21,540 --> 11:13:23,540
I know the Vod.

9453
11:13:23,540 --> 11:13:25,540
I know we have to think of the Vod.

9454
11:13:25,540 --> 11:13:27,540
Please, someone think of the Vod.

9455
11:13:27,540 --> 11:13:29,540
I know.

9456
11:13:29,540 --> 11:13:31,540
We're playing tomorrow.

9457
11:13:31,540 --> 11:13:33,540
We have more time. We can play tomorrow.

9458
11:13:33,540 --> 11:13:35,540
Much better time for everyone

9459
11:13:35,540 --> 11:13:37,540
because I don't normally stream at this time.

9460
11:13:39,540 --> 11:13:41,540
I'll tell you, for the last 20 minutes

9461
11:13:41,540 --> 11:13:43,540
we'll read marshmallows

9462
11:13:43,540 --> 11:13:45,540
in a nice and cosy deal.

9463
11:13:45,540 --> 11:13:47,540
I'll put my blankie around me

9464
11:13:47,540 --> 11:13:49,540
and get ready to sleep.

9465
11:13:51,540 --> 11:13:53,540
Okay, very interesting attack pattern.

9466
11:13:53,540 --> 11:13:55,540
Please don't do that again.

9467
11:13:55,540 --> 11:13:57,540
Yep, no poise, get wrecked.

9468
11:13:59,540 --> 11:14:01,540
Thank you.

9469
11:14:05,540 --> 11:14:07,540
How well the reflins...

9470
11:14:07,540 --> 11:14:09,540
We've finished the DLC.

9471
11:14:09,540 --> 11:14:11,540
We've gone back to base game

9472
11:14:11,540 --> 11:14:13,540
and I haven't done before.

9473
11:14:13,540 --> 11:14:15,540
I've kept

9474
11:14:15,540 --> 11:14:17,540
my maid in alive

9475
11:14:17,540 --> 11:14:19,540
and we're just trying to undo the frenzied flame.

9476
11:14:23,540 --> 11:14:25,540
We seem to be

9477
11:14:25,540 --> 11:14:27,540
doing pretty alright.

9478
11:14:27,540 --> 11:14:29,540
No, stop

9479
11:14:29,540 --> 11:14:31,540
locking onto the reflin. He's a guide, okay?

9480
11:14:31,540 --> 11:14:33,540
Okay, here we go.

9481
11:14:39,540 --> 11:14:41,540
It's rather lonely

9482
11:14:41,540 --> 11:14:43,540
when it's just the three of us.

9483
11:14:47,540 --> 11:14:49,540
Hokusha, sleep on that thing

9484
11:14:49,540 --> 11:14:51,540
the big comfy match.

9485
11:14:51,540 --> 11:14:53,540
Honestly.

9486
11:14:53,540 --> 11:14:55,540
No, honestly.

9487
11:14:55,540 --> 11:14:57,540
Okay, we're healing.

9488
11:14:57,540 --> 11:14:59,540
Oh, this is the boss fight

9489
11:14:59,540 --> 11:15:01,540
I've ever seen one.

9490
11:15:03,540 --> 11:15:05,540
I'm sure

9491
11:15:05,540 --> 11:15:07,540
this reflin will carry me, right?

9492
11:15:07,540 --> 11:15:09,540
This reflin will carry me.

9493
11:15:09,540 --> 11:15:11,540
Yeah, nice part is tomorrow

9494
11:15:11,540 --> 11:15:13,540
you can take your time and enjoy more.

9495
11:15:15,540 --> 11:15:17,540
Okay, this will be fine.

9496
11:15:19,540 --> 11:15:21,540
No pressure on the other

9497
11:15:21,540 --> 11:15:23,540
refling at all.

9498
11:15:23,540 --> 11:15:25,540
No pressure.

9499
11:15:25,540 --> 11:15:27,540
Oh.

9500
11:15:27,540 --> 11:15:29,540
That reflin's had enough.

9501
11:15:33,540 --> 11:15:35,540
What a strange attack.

9502
11:15:37,540 --> 11:15:39,540
Force the head with a magic sword.

9503
11:15:45,540 --> 11:15:47,540
Thank you, reflin, for your sacrifice.

9504
11:15:47,540 --> 11:15:49,540
You know you can just use the finger, right?

9505
11:15:49,540 --> 11:15:51,540
You do this every time.

9506
11:15:51,540 --> 11:15:53,540
Okay, what are you?

9507
11:15:53,540 --> 11:15:55,540
What are you?

9508
11:15:55,540 --> 11:15:57,540
Oh my god, I'm destroying the dainan table.

9509
11:15:57,540 --> 11:15:59,540
Do you know how much all that would have caused?

9510
11:15:59,540 --> 11:16:01,540
Fuck you, I have the bigger sword.

9511
11:16:05,540 --> 11:16:07,540
Oh my god.

9512
11:16:07,540 --> 11:16:09,540
It's a rave.

9513
11:16:09,540 --> 11:16:11,540
I'm out of stamina, hold on.

9514
11:16:11,540 --> 11:16:13,540
Hold on, I'm out of stamina.

9515
11:16:13,540 --> 11:16:15,540
I can't even save him.

9516
11:16:17,540 --> 11:16:19,540
Yeah, take that.

9517
11:16:19,540 --> 11:16:21,540
Elmer of the briar, more like

9518
11:16:21,540 --> 11:16:23,540
Elmer of the friar

9519
11:16:23,540 --> 11:16:25,540
because you'll be working in an efficient chip shop

9520
11:16:25,540 --> 11:16:27,540
after this job.

9521
11:16:27,540 --> 11:16:29,540
You'll get fired.

9522
11:16:29,540 --> 11:16:31,540
I got it, I got it.

9523
11:16:31,540 --> 11:16:33,540
I touched the grace.

9524
11:16:33,540 --> 11:16:35,540
Now what?

9525
11:16:35,540 --> 11:16:37,540
I got an achievement for that.

9526
11:16:43,540 --> 11:16:45,540
Oh my god, reflin turned into a tree

9527
11:16:45,540 --> 11:16:47,540
of one sort, a phoenix.

9528
11:16:47,540 --> 11:16:49,540
Did I do that?

9529
11:16:49,540 --> 11:16:51,540
Get created on.

9530
11:16:53,540 --> 11:16:55,540
Look at the painting, it's so pretty.

9531
11:16:57,540 --> 11:16:59,540
Alright.

9532
11:16:59,540 --> 11:17:01,540
Go to quest, go back to

9533
11:17:01,540 --> 11:17:03,540
on the stargazing hill.

9534
11:17:03,540 --> 11:17:05,540
Oh yeah, it's okay.

9535
11:17:07,540 --> 11:17:09,540
Stargazing.

9536
11:17:13,540 --> 11:17:15,540
Let's go.

9537
11:17:15,540 --> 11:17:17,540
Attu's plateau.

9538
11:17:17,540 --> 11:17:19,540
A bit of a plateau by you.

9539
11:17:19,540 --> 11:17:21,540
Of course.

9540
11:17:21,540 --> 11:17:23,540
Oh wait, she was like right here.

9541
11:17:23,540 --> 11:17:25,540
She was like very cool spy.

9542
11:17:25,540 --> 11:17:27,540
I don't think I need a torrent for that, hello.

9543
11:17:31,540 --> 11:17:33,540
Give her.

9544
11:17:33,540 --> 11:17:35,540
Yeah, sure, sure.

9545
11:17:35,540 --> 11:17:37,540
I don't really have much of a use for it.

9546
11:17:37,540 --> 11:17:39,540
It doesn't really feel like someone else is doing anything.

9547
11:17:39,540 --> 11:17:41,540
Defeats the purpose of

9548
11:17:41,540 --> 11:17:43,540
having another arm available.

9549
11:17:45,540 --> 11:17:47,540
It's possible for me to wield a sword again.

9550
11:17:47,540 --> 11:17:49,540
Yeah, if you want, sure.

9551
11:17:49,540 --> 11:17:51,540
If the arm serves,

9552
11:17:51,540 --> 11:17:53,540
it might be possible perhaps,

9553
11:17:53,540 --> 11:17:55,540
then I can aid you in battle.

9554
11:17:55,540 --> 11:17:57,540
Yeah, if you'd like.

9555
11:17:57,540 --> 11:17:59,540
If the arm, it might be possible perhaps then.

9556
11:17:59,540 --> 11:18:01,540
Okay, go to windmill village next.

9557
11:18:03,540 --> 11:18:05,540
Where was the windmill village?

9558
11:18:05,540 --> 11:18:07,540
Windmill village.

9559
11:18:11,540 --> 11:18:13,540
Need a hand.

9560
11:18:13,540 --> 11:18:15,540
Give her a round of applause.

9561
11:18:15,540 --> 11:18:17,540
Clap, clap, clap.

9562
11:18:17,540 --> 11:18:19,540
Is she here?

9563
11:18:23,540 --> 11:18:25,540
I don't seem to see her.

9564
11:18:27,540 --> 11:18:29,540
Is she propped against something?

9565
11:18:31,540 --> 11:18:33,540
Some in the reeflands?

9566
11:18:35,540 --> 11:18:37,540
Oh, there we go.

9567
11:18:41,540 --> 11:18:43,540
Fanix, she never got a shot.

9568
11:18:49,540 --> 11:18:51,540
Mitra's disciple?

9569
11:18:51,540 --> 11:18:53,540
You're not an NPC.

9570
11:18:53,540 --> 11:18:55,540
You're just fucking with me though.

9571
11:18:55,540 --> 11:18:57,540
I like the name like that.

9572
11:19:01,540 --> 11:19:03,540
She's near the end of the village.

9573
11:19:03,540 --> 11:19:05,540
Like, off into it.

9574
11:19:07,540 --> 11:19:09,540
And then, naughty, refling,

9575
11:19:09,540 --> 11:19:11,540
slips, and I just had to use her belly.

9576
11:19:21,540 --> 11:19:23,540
I swear, you give off NPC vibes,

9577
11:19:23,540 --> 11:19:25,540
and you're not though.

9578
11:19:25,540 --> 11:19:27,540
No, no NPC would move like that.

9579
11:19:29,540 --> 11:19:31,540
It's just the name.

9580
11:19:31,540 --> 11:19:33,540
It's just something the game would put in.

9581
11:19:35,540 --> 11:19:37,540
Right, we don't need to hurt the ladies

9582
11:19:37,540 --> 11:19:39,540
if they don't hurt us, you know?

9583
11:19:41,540 --> 11:19:43,540
Come, come, come.

9584
11:19:43,540 --> 11:19:45,540
Let us go together.

9585
11:19:45,540 --> 11:19:47,540
Okay, let's go together.

9586
11:19:49,540 --> 11:19:51,540
After boss, fight, talk to her,

9587
11:19:51,540 --> 11:19:53,540
and then it'll be a while before you see her again.

9588
11:19:53,540 --> 11:19:55,540
Or you'll need to get access to Makayla,

9589
11:19:55,540 --> 11:19:57,540
which you'll need to find the medallion.

9590
11:19:57,540 --> 11:19:59,540
Oh, are you okay, dar?

9591
11:19:59,540 --> 11:20:01,540
Well, crazy over there.

9592
11:20:01,540 --> 11:20:03,540
Right, they don't attack us,

9593
11:20:03,540 --> 11:20:05,540
so there's no point in putting them.

9594
11:20:09,540 --> 11:20:11,540
They seem happy as long as they're flourishing.

9595
11:20:13,540 --> 11:20:15,540
The next part will take too long.

9596
11:20:15,540 --> 11:20:17,540
Okay, I'm okay to read marshmallows for the rest then.

9597
11:20:17,540 --> 11:20:19,540
Whoa!

9598
11:20:19,540 --> 11:20:21,540
What did we do to annoy them?

9599
11:20:21,540 --> 11:20:23,540
Whoa, why are their eyes red?

9600
11:20:27,540 --> 11:20:29,540
I didn't do anything!

9601
11:20:29,540 --> 11:20:31,540
I don't know why they go aggressive.

9602
11:20:31,540 --> 11:20:33,540
That wasn't fun.

9603
11:20:39,540 --> 11:20:41,540
Okay, we'll read marshmallows after this bit, then.

9604
11:20:45,540 --> 11:20:47,540
Two lovers.

9605
11:20:53,540 --> 11:20:55,540
Am I supposed to summon her here or something?

9606
11:20:57,540 --> 11:20:59,540
Or am I just to kill this boss?

9607
11:21:03,540 --> 11:21:05,540
Uh, did I kill the boss?

9608
11:21:05,540 --> 11:21:07,540
No, it's just to fight.

9609
11:21:07,540 --> 11:21:09,540
Okay, right, I don't need to summon her.

9610
11:21:11,540 --> 11:21:13,540
But we'll get madness going.

9611
11:21:13,540 --> 11:21:15,540
That's right, pop, pop, pop, get madness.

9612
11:21:15,540 --> 11:21:17,540
Ooh, straight charm, strong.

9613
11:21:19,540 --> 11:21:21,540
Okay.

9614
11:21:21,540 --> 11:21:23,540
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, enemy fell.

9615
11:21:23,540 --> 11:21:25,540
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, get pop.

9616
11:21:25,540 --> 11:21:27,540
This is a celebration of madness.

9617
11:21:27,540 --> 11:21:29,540
It looks really good.

9618
11:21:29,540 --> 11:21:31,540
Like the...

9619
11:21:31,540 --> 11:21:33,540
Why are you kneeling?

9620
11:21:33,540 --> 11:21:35,540
We won!

9621
11:21:35,540 --> 11:21:37,540
Uh, then what?

9622
11:21:37,540 --> 11:21:39,540
The lady appears at the shack.

9623
11:21:43,540 --> 11:21:45,540
Do I need to reload the rest at the grace and then she'll show up?

9624
11:21:45,540 --> 11:21:47,540
Okay.

9625
11:21:47,540 --> 11:21:49,540
Pass time.

9626
11:21:49,540 --> 11:21:51,540
To the morning.

9627
11:21:51,540 --> 11:21:53,540
Just when it's not that hard, if I said.

9628
11:21:55,540 --> 11:21:57,540
How long is this stream?

9629
11:21:57,540 --> 11:21:59,540
Uh, the vod's about to expire in 20 minutes.

9630
11:21:59,540 --> 11:22:01,540
Are we gonna go between me?

9631
11:22:01,540 --> 11:22:03,540
Oh, there she is.

9632
11:22:03,540 --> 11:22:05,540
Hello.

9633
11:22:05,540 --> 11:22:07,540
Hi.

9634
11:22:07,540 --> 11:22:09,540
Now look at your arm.

9635
11:22:11,540 --> 11:22:13,540
Is it gorgeous?

9636
11:22:15,540 --> 11:22:17,540
Yeah, you like it.

9637
11:22:21,540 --> 11:22:23,540
Aw, that's lovely.

9638
11:22:25,540 --> 11:22:27,540
Oh, I've got a little tingling.

9639
11:22:29,540 --> 11:22:31,540
Got one more for Eep, time to relax.

9640
11:22:33,540 --> 11:22:35,540
An expression like that.

9641
11:22:35,540 --> 11:22:37,540
Okay.

9642
11:22:37,540 --> 11:22:39,540
Is that us?

9643
11:22:39,540 --> 11:22:41,540
I'm so Eepy.

9644
11:22:41,540 --> 11:22:45,540
I'm very happy to say tomorrow's stream is probably just a regular two hour stream.

9645
11:22:45,540 --> 11:22:47,540
Uh, I don't...

9646
11:22:47,540 --> 11:22:49,540
I think we can progress.

9647
11:22:49,540 --> 11:22:51,540
We're talking to her here.

9648
11:22:51,540 --> 11:22:53,540
There is one more fast step.

9649
11:22:53,540 --> 11:22:55,540
Travel to ancient Snow Valley ruins and talk to her there.

9650
11:22:57,540 --> 11:22:59,540
Mm-hmm.

9651
11:22:59,540 --> 11:23:01,540
Do I have that unlocked?

9652
11:23:01,540 --> 11:23:03,540
I don't think I have that unlocked.

9653
11:23:07,540 --> 11:23:09,540
The...

9654
11:23:09,540 --> 11:23:11,540
Ancient...

9655
11:23:11,540 --> 11:23:13,540
Ancient Snow Valley ruins and talk to her there.

9656
11:23:15,540 --> 11:23:17,540
Okay.

9657
11:23:17,540 --> 11:23:19,540
To the mountain, to the top.

9658
11:23:19,540 --> 11:23:23,540
Oh, jeez, you are right on a high.

9659
11:23:25,540 --> 11:23:27,540
Yes.

9660
11:23:29,540 --> 11:23:31,540
I'm on Google trying to finish your quest line, darling.

9661
11:23:43,540 --> 11:23:45,540
Okay.

9662
11:23:47,540 --> 11:23:49,540
Mm-hmm.

9663
11:23:55,540 --> 11:23:57,540
Okay.

9664
11:23:59,540 --> 11:24:01,540
Mm-hmm.

9665
11:24:09,540 --> 11:24:11,540
Do I have the medallions?

9666
11:24:11,540 --> 11:24:13,540
This for here?

9667
11:24:13,540 --> 11:24:15,540
Oh, is that what you're saying?

9668
11:24:15,540 --> 11:24:17,540
I don't have enough time to do it?

9669
11:24:25,540 --> 11:24:27,540
Mm-hmm.

9670
11:24:27,540 --> 11:24:29,540
Is it Marshmallow time?

9671
11:24:31,540 --> 11:24:33,540
Do medallions next time?

9672
11:24:33,540 --> 11:24:35,540
Okay, we'll do medallions tomorrow.

9673
11:24:35,540 --> 11:24:37,540
Yeah, I'll take like 32 minutes.

9674
11:24:37,540 --> 11:24:39,540
My body hurts.

9675
11:24:39,540 --> 11:24:41,540
I'm gonna try and stretch though.

9676
11:24:41,540 --> 11:24:43,540
I'm gonna try and stretch though.

9677
11:24:47,540 --> 11:24:49,540
Okay.

9678
11:24:51,540 --> 11:24:53,540
No, I'm not tired.

9679
11:24:53,540 --> 11:24:55,540
Okay, I'm a little tired.

9680
11:25:01,540 --> 11:25:03,540
Well, there isn't a pause in this game,

9681
11:25:03,540 --> 11:25:05,540
because that would be too convenient.

9682
11:25:07,540 --> 11:25:09,540
We're 35 hours into this file.

9683
11:25:09,540 --> 11:25:11,540
Quit the game.

9684
11:25:11,540 --> 11:25:13,540
Yes, I want to quit the game.

9685
11:25:15,540 --> 11:25:17,540
I will play it tomorrow.

9686
11:25:17,540 --> 11:25:19,540
I'll make myself feel big.

9687
11:25:19,540 --> 11:25:21,540
Be big strength.

9688
11:25:23,540 --> 11:25:25,540
Okay, let me rid some marshmallows.

9689
11:25:31,540 --> 11:25:33,540
35, and you already beat the DLC?

9690
11:25:33,540 --> 11:25:35,540
I got carried.

9691
11:25:35,540 --> 11:25:37,540
I got all my items gifted and everything,

9692
11:25:37,540 --> 11:25:39,540
so please don't think I'm good.

9693
11:25:53,540 --> 11:25:55,540
Big man.

9694
11:25:55,540 --> 11:25:57,540
Big.

9695
11:25:57,540 --> 11:25:59,540
Next stream, we just found the

9696
11:25:59,540 --> 11:26:01,540
Albina Eric women?

9697
11:26:03,540 --> 11:26:05,540
What?

9698
11:26:05,540 --> 11:26:07,540
There's far too many vowels for my main

9699
11:26:07,540 --> 11:26:09,540
to be written right now.

9700
11:26:09,540 --> 11:26:11,540
Hey, mommy, wishing the Elden Ring was cross-played

9701
11:26:11,540 --> 11:26:13,540
so I could have played with you. I'm sorry.

9702
11:26:13,540 --> 11:26:15,540
Also, please make a cut with you.

9703
11:26:15,540 --> 11:26:17,540
I want to feel warmth from being here.

9704
11:26:17,540 --> 11:26:19,540
Can I be the

9705
11:26:19,540 --> 11:26:21,540
the big spoon,

9706
11:26:21,540 --> 11:26:23,540
and then I'll hug you from behind,

9707
11:26:23,540 --> 11:26:25,540
and I'll hold on to your tummy?

9708
11:26:25,540 --> 11:26:27,540
Am I allowed to do that? Huh?

9709
11:26:27,540 --> 11:26:29,540
I want to do that.

9710
11:26:29,540 --> 11:26:31,540
I want to hold on to your belly

9711
11:26:31,540 --> 11:26:33,540
from behind.

9712
11:26:33,540 --> 11:26:35,540
She carried us

9713
11:26:35,540 --> 11:26:37,540
as if you carried me. Are you joking?

9714
11:26:37,540 --> 11:26:39,540
Thank you for the long stream cutters

9715
11:26:39,540 --> 11:26:41,540
I've been watching since I began. How are you awake?

9716
11:26:41,540 --> 11:26:43,540
And I've been in and out of

9717
11:26:43,540 --> 11:26:45,540
consciousness as I deal with the flow.

9718
11:26:45,540 --> 11:26:47,540
I did catch you talking about giving

9719
11:26:47,540 --> 11:26:49,540
a show for the delivery guy.

9720
11:26:49,540 --> 11:26:51,540
I did not give a show for this delivery guy.

9721
11:26:51,540 --> 11:26:53,540
I bet that would have healed me right away.

9722
11:26:53,540 --> 11:26:55,540
I hope you feel better soon. Try your best

9723
11:26:55,540 --> 11:26:57,540
to hydrate. That is how you

9724
11:26:57,540 --> 11:26:59,540
fight viruses most efficiently.

9725
11:26:59,540 --> 11:27:01,540
The more watery your

9726
11:27:01,540 --> 11:27:03,540
blood is, the better.

9727
11:27:03,540 --> 11:27:05,540
The white blood cells get

9728
11:27:05,540 --> 11:27:07,540
the virus. You're welcome.

9729
11:27:07,540 --> 11:27:09,540
That's a very big oversimplification

9730
11:27:09,540 --> 11:27:11,540
of what actually happens.

9731
11:27:11,540 --> 11:27:13,540
My tummy's all chubby.

9732
11:27:13,540 --> 11:27:15,540
You don't know?

9733
11:27:15,540 --> 11:27:17,540
I like

9734
11:27:17,540 --> 11:27:19,540
big bellies. I like

9735
11:27:19,540 --> 11:27:21,540
big bellies and I cannot lie.

9736
11:27:23,540 --> 11:27:25,540
Have a good rest. Love you.

9737
11:27:25,540 --> 11:27:27,540
I love you too. Make sure you get rest too.

9738
11:27:27,540 --> 11:27:29,540
I love mommy. I want mommy.

9739
11:27:29,540 --> 11:27:31,540
Hugs with mommy. Cuddles with mommy.

9740
11:27:31,540 --> 11:27:33,540
Nuzzles with mommy. Hugs and kisses

9741
11:27:33,540 --> 11:27:35,540
with mommy. I want mommy to tell me

9742
11:27:35,540 --> 11:27:37,540
she loves us on the telephone.

9743
11:27:37,540 --> 11:27:39,540
I love you. I love you. I love you.

9744
11:27:39,540 --> 11:27:41,540
Please just R.

9745
11:27:41,540 --> 11:27:43,540
That went

9746
11:27:43,540 --> 11:27:45,540
exactly

9747
11:27:45,540 --> 11:27:47,540
Thank you

9748
11:27:47,540 --> 11:27:49,540
Nogan for the 20 gifted memberships.

9749
11:27:49,540 --> 11:27:51,540
Congrats to those who caught it with your face.

9750
11:27:51,540 --> 11:27:53,540
Those were kind of you, Nogan.

9751
11:27:53,540 --> 11:27:55,540
Thank you.

9752
11:27:55,540 --> 11:27:57,540
Thank you.

9753
11:27:57,540 --> 11:27:59,540
It was

9754
11:27:59,540 --> 11:28:01,540
a beautiful gifted membership.

9755
11:28:01,540 --> 11:28:03,540
Did you beat the DLC? Oh yeah.

9756
11:28:03,540 --> 11:28:05,540
I beat the crap out of that boss.

9757
11:28:05,540 --> 11:28:07,540
Well, it's not big

9758
11:28:07,540 --> 11:28:09,540
but like it's 20.

9759
11:28:09,540 --> 11:28:11,540
Yeah. I'll make it bigger.

9760
11:28:11,540 --> 11:28:13,540
Thank you again,

9761
11:28:13,540 --> 11:28:15,540
Nogan, for the 20 gifted

9762
11:28:15,540 --> 11:28:17,540
and Mass for the gifted earlier.

9763
11:28:17,540 --> 11:28:19,540
That was insane.

9764
11:28:19,540 --> 11:28:21,540
Mommy, please just R.

9765
11:28:21,540 --> 11:28:23,540
with the hic at me already. Consensually of course.

9766
11:28:23,540 --> 11:28:25,540
Why of course?

9767
11:28:25,540 --> 11:28:27,540
Mommy, I'm coming tomorrow.

9768
11:28:27,540 --> 11:28:29,540
We do even

9769
11:28:29,540 --> 11:28:31,540
more stream sniping tomorrow.

9770
11:28:33,540 --> 11:28:35,540
This might be a stretch, but is Reefling

9771
11:28:35,540 --> 11:28:37,540
a reference to something?

9772
11:28:37,540 --> 11:28:39,540
You're my Reefling.

9773
11:28:39,540 --> 11:28:41,540
Just because it was

9774
11:28:41,540 --> 11:28:43,540
spelt like another streamer's

9775
11:28:43,540 --> 11:28:45,540
audience doesn't mean it's the same.

9776
11:28:45,540 --> 11:28:47,540
You're my Reefling.

9777
11:28:49,540 --> 11:28:51,540
Okay, Mommy, I had

9778
11:28:51,540 --> 11:28:53,540
an idea. What if for your audience,

9779
11:28:53,540 --> 11:28:55,540
you had them connected by having

9780
11:28:55,540 --> 11:28:57,540
you always doing something

9781
11:28:57,540 --> 11:28:59,540
factual at various jobs

9782
11:28:59,540 --> 11:29:01,540
and the reason Strony has to keep getting new jobs

9783
11:29:01,540 --> 11:29:03,540
is for being actually inappropriate

9784
11:29:03,540 --> 11:29:05,540
towards the customers and managers

9785
11:29:05,540 --> 11:29:07,540
to keep running

9786
11:29:07,540 --> 11:29:09,540
into the listener at every new job.

9787
11:29:09,540 --> 11:29:11,540
Strony Audio Universe,

9788
11:29:11,540 --> 11:29:13,540
Strony Strony Audio Universe,

9789
11:29:13,540 --> 11:29:15,540
Strony Audio Universe, if you will.

9790
11:29:17,540 --> 11:29:19,540
Not totally different, just like a winky dink.

9791
11:29:19,540 --> 11:29:21,540
Completely winky dink.

9792
11:29:27,540 --> 11:29:29,540
To add to my

9793
11:29:29,540 --> 11:29:31,540
degenerate sleep fantasy,

9794
11:29:31,540 --> 11:29:33,540
hold on a minute.

9795
11:29:33,540 --> 11:29:35,540
You'd wake up to the smell of breakfast that I

9796
11:29:35,540 --> 11:29:37,540
cooked for us so you could have another healthy

9797
11:29:37,540 --> 11:29:39,540
meal.

9798
11:29:39,540 --> 11:29:41,540
Yeah, you like stream sniping

9799
11:29:41,540 --> 11:29:43,540
on the weekends?

9800
11:29:43,540 --> 11:29:45,540
Aw, did you

9801
11:29:45,540 --> 11:29:47,540
like it on the weekend? I picked the weekend

9802
11:29:47,540 --> 11:29:49,540
because I knew more people would be available

9803
11:29:49,540 --> 11:29:51,540
for this game on the weekend, although Elden Ring

9804
11:29:51,540 --> 11:29:53,540
is a rather expensive game I have to admit.

9805
11:29:53,540 --> 11:29:55,540
It's not exactly the cheapest

9806
11:29:55,540 --> 11:29:57,540
stream snip game I've done so far. Hydration check.

9807
11:30:01,540 --> 11:30:03,540
Strony Audio Universe must be a wonderful play.

9808
11:30:03,540 --> 11:30:05,540
What a wonderful play.

9809
11:30:09,540 --> 11:30:11,540
Dear Cuttle Pop, yesterday's stream

9810
11:30:11,540 --> 11:30:13,540
was a technical gun.

9811
11:30:13,540 --> 11:30:15,540
The most of my both stream and my system.

9812
11:30:15,540 --> 11:30:17,540
I want to...

9813
11:30:17,540 --> 11:30:19,540
I can't read that. Are you... Reflin!

9814
11:30:19,540 --> 11:30:21,540
You can't say all of that

9815
11:30:21,540 --> 11:30:23,540
and then go also, how's the Diary?

9816
11:30:23,540 --> 11:30:25,540
I love you. Right, Reflin, you're done.

9817
11:30:25,540 --> 11:30:27,540
You're done.

9818
11:30:27,540 --> 11:30:29,540
You're actually in trouble.

9819
11:30:29,540 --> 11:30:31,540
Thank you reluctantly saying for the tip.

9820
11:30:31,540 --> 11:30:33,540
Fucking

9821
11:30:33,540 --> 11:30:35,540
what an ending.

9822
11:30:35,540 --> 11:30:37,540
I was like, goes into war.

9823
11:30:37,540 --> 11:30:39,540
Live and do it any way you like.

9824
11:30:39,540 --> 11:30:41,540
I'm allowed to do whatever I want to this Reflin.

9825
11:30:41,540 --> 11:30:43,540
By the way, how's the Diary?

9826
11:30:43,540 --> 11:30:45,540
One? How dare you? Two? Alright then.

9827
11:30:47,540 --> 11:30:49,540
I wanted to play Elden Ring with you today

9828
11:30:49,540 --> 11:30:51,540
but haven't started the DLC. I'll definitely try and help tomorrow.

9829
11:30:51,540 --> 11:30:53,540
Hopefully I can kill Malania for it.

9830
11:30:53,540 --> 11:30:55,540
Yes, we're doing base

9831
11:30:55,540 --> 11:30:57,540
only now.

9832
11:30:57,540 --> 11:30:59,540
You know, I need to try and fit the base.

9833
11:31:01,540 --> 11:31:03,540
We're speedrunning

9834
11:31:03,540 --> 11:31:05,540
for your freedom. No!

9835
11:31:05,540 --> 11:31:07,540
I literally planned Elden Ring for three more days.

9836
11:31:07,540 --> 11:31:09,540
That's how long I thought it was going to take.

9837
11:31:09,540 --> 11:31:11,540
I didn't realise how much you guys were going to be

9838
11:31:11,540 --> 11:31:13,540
able to fucking

9839
11:31:13,540 --> 11:31:15,540
carry me. That was like

9840
11:31:15,540 --> 11:31:17,540
insane.

9841
11:31:17,540 --> 11:31:19,540
I didn't expect it

9842
11:31:19,540 --> 11:31:21,540
at all.

9843
11:31:21,540 --> 11:31:23,540
You already did it.

9844
11:31:25,540 --> 11:31:27,540
Good thing I've got a big barely.

9845
11:31:27,540 --> 11:31:29,540
Also, this is from the same Reflin that wanted to be held since

9846
11:31:29,540 --> 11:31:31,540
I couldn't join you in Elden Ring due to cross play.

9847
11:31:31,540 --> 11:31:33,540
Man, fuck cross play.

9848
11:31:33,540 --> 11:31:35,540
Me and my Reflins hate cross play. We just

9849
11:31:35,540 --> 11:31:37,540
want to play play.

9850
11:31:37,540 --> 11:31:39,540
I unlocked a new emoji slot.

9851
11:31:39,540 --> 11:31:41,540
Wait, do I even have anything on my desktop

9852
11:31:41,540 --> 11:31:43,540
that can...

9853
11:31:43,540 --> 11:31:45,540
Can I use a picture?

9854
11:31:45,540 --> 11:31:47,540
I'm sorry, I'm so white right now.

9855
11:31:47,540 --> 11:31:49,540
I'm so pale.

9856
11:31:49,540 --> 11:31:51,540
Wait, do I even have a picture?

9857
11:31:51,540 --> 11:31:53,540
I have a picture of Sin Sister.

9858
11:31:53,540 --> 11:31:55,540
I'll just put a random picture of that on it.

9859
11:31:55,540 --> 11:31:57,540
I can put you in your wee chain.

9860
11:31:57,540 --> 11:31:59,540
Hold on, wait, this might work?

9861
11:31:59,540 --> 11:32:01,540
I don't know if this is going to work. Hold on.

9862
11:32:01,540 --> 11:32:03,540
Bear with me.

9863
11:32:05,540 --> 11:32:07,540
This is going to be a really

9864
11:32:07,540 --> 11:32:09,540
soft emoji, but it's going to be worth it.

9865
11:32:09,540 --> 11:32:11,540
Hold on. That was my PC.

9866
11:32:11,540 --> 11:32:13,540
That was my PC. Hold on.

9867
11:32:13,540 --> 11:32:15,540
I want to see how fast this works.

9868
11:32:23,540 --> 11:32:25,540
How fast does that work in chat?

9869
11:32:27,540 --> 11:32:29,540
It says changes saved. If you refresh,

9870
11:32:29,540 --> 11:32:31,540
can you see a new emote up?

9871
11:32:31,540 --> 11:32:33,540
Just literally a random cinema.

9872
11:32:33,540 --> 11:32:35,540
That was Ms.

9873
11:32:35,540 --> 11:32:37,540
Muzz.

9874
11:32:37,540 --> 11:32:39,540
I'm not sure if you can see it. It might not work.

9875
11:32:39,540 --> 11:32:41,540
But we got a new...

9876
11:32:41,540 --> 11:32:43,540
Oh, it worked! Oh my god, it worked.

9877
11:32:43,540 --> 11:32:45,540
What the fuck? It was so quick.

9878
11:32:47,540 --> 11:32:49,540
It had to be squished really awkwardly

9879
11:32:49,540 --> 11:32:51,540
to get it to accept the files.

9880
11:32:51,540 --> 11:32:53,540
Let's see.

9881
11:32:55,540 --> 11:32:57,540
Thanks for the full day of entertainment. Love you and see you tomorrow.

9882
11:32:57,540 --> 11:32:59,540
I'll see you tomorrow. Love you too, Evelyn.

9883
11:32:59,540 --> 11:33:01,540
Thank you for hanging in.

9884
11:33:01,540 --> 11:33:03,540
I understand. It was very, very long.

9885
11:33:05,540 --> 11:33:07,540
Love you lots and lots. No, I love you lots and lots.

9886
11:33:07,540 --> 11:33:09,540
Your dedication is

9887
11:33:09,540 --> 11:33:11,540
admirable

9888
11:33:11,540 --> 11:33:13,540
and I adore your passion and love for the reef.

9889
11:33:13,540 --> 11:33:15,540
Big hugs and well wishes. Hope you get some good rest.

9890
11:33:15,540 --> 11:33:17,540
Yeah, I'm going to get beaks and beaks.

9891
11:33:17,540 --> 11:33:19,540
Love you. Love you too.

9892
11:33:19,540 --> 11:33:21,540
Oh, by the way.

9893
11:33:21,540 --> 11:33:23,540
No, go away.

9894
11:33:23,540 --> 11:33:25,540
I'm not reading that.

9895
11:33:25,540 --> 11:33:27,540
Yes, you can be the big spin mummy.

9896
11:33:27,540 --> 11:33:29,540
I'd love it.

9897
11:33:31,540 --> 11:33:33,540
Yeah.

9898
11:33:33,540 --> 11:33:35,540
It's funny love.

9899
11:33:35,540 --> 11:33:37,540
Be sure to rest.

9900
11:33:37,540 --> 11:33:39,540
Nori love.

9901
11:33:39,540 --> 11:33:41,540
Any recommendations for gamers up?

9902
11:33:41,540 --> 11:33:43,540
I'm trying gamers up for the first time in a membership stream.

9903
11:33:43,540 --> 11:33:45,540
So I'll be able to actually tell you

9904
11:33:45,540 --> 11:33:47,540
what flavors I recommend the most.

9905
11:33:47,540 --> 11:33:49,540
I'm going to like rank the flavors.

9906
11:33:51,540 --> 11:33:53,540
So it's going to be like a weird hand cam stream.

9907
11:33:53,540 --> 11:33:55,540
Half not half on.

9908
11:33:55,540 --> 11:33:57,540
Mum, may I selfishly request

9909
11:33:57,540 --> 11:33:59,540
another sample of you making the very realistic

9910
11:33:59,540 --> 11:34:01,540
sound using your finger and saliva?

9911
11:34:05,540 --> 11:34:07,540
Maybe.

9912
11:34:09,540 --> 11:34:11,540
Thank you for the stream mum.

9913
11:34:11,540 --> 11:34:13,540
I'm going to go ink myself to you now.

9914
11:34:13,540 --> 11:34:15,540
Okay. Well, you said it.

9915
11:34:15,540 --> 11:34:17,540
You said how it was. Thank you.

9916
11:34:17,540 --> 11:34:19,540
I'm going to miss you a lot.

9917
11:34:19,540 --> 11:34:21,540
Get huggies.

9918
11:34:21,540 --> 11:34:23,540
I'm a pirate, but even pirates need hugs.

9919
11:34:23,540 --> 11:34:25,540
Yes.

9920
11:34:25,540 --> 11:34:27,540
If you're the big spin,

9921
11:34:27,540 --> 11:34:29,540
we have hum in our ears to help us fall asleep.

9922
11:34:29,540 --> 11:34:31,540
If you won,

9923
11:34:31,540 --> 11:34:33,540
I would sing

9924
11:34:33,540 --> 11:34:35,540
Legend of Zelda. It's a classic.

9925
11:34:35,540 --> 11:34:37,540
I've completely

9926
11:34:37,540 --> 11:34:39,540
forgotten the sound of Legend of Zelda

9927
11:34:39,540 --> 11:34:41,540
because Elden Ring is currently in my ears right now.

9928
11:34:45,540 --> 11:34:47,540
What's that? Oh god.

9929
11:34:47,540 --> 11:34:49,540
Wait.

9930
11:34:53,540 --> 11:34:55,540
That one?

9931
11:34:55,540 --> 11:34:57,540
It's a little bit nicer.

9932
11:34:57,540 --> 11:34:59,540
Obviously my voice isn't fried,

9933
11:34:59,540 --> 11:35:01,540
but it's a little bit fried right now.

9934
11:35:01,540 --> 11:35:03,540
You know, sometimes talking

9935
11:35:03,540 --> 11:35:05,540
for over 16 hours will do that to you.

9936
11:35:05,540 --> 11:35:07,540
Because I was having to communicate to the team

9937
11:35:07,540 --> 11:35:09,540
before my stream started, you know.

9938
11:35:09,540 --> 11:35:11,540
Oh, someone asked that.

9939
11:35:11,540 --> 11:35:13,540
Oh my god. Someone asked that and I never answered.

9940
11:35:13,540 --> 11:35:15,540
Someone asked,

9941
11:35:15,540 --> 11:35:17,540
is it hard to bring new people into the team?

9942
11:35:17,540 --> 11:35:19,540
Yes, it is next time possible.

9943
11:35:19,540 --> 11:35:21,540
It is incredibly hard to find.

9944
11:35:21,540 --> 11:35:23,540
Trustworthy people

9945
11:35:23,540 --> 11:35:25,540
that

9946
11:35:25,540 --> 11:35:27,540
aren't trying to groom the girls.

9947
11:35:27,540 --> 11:35:29,540
So I have to

9948
11:35:29,540 --> 11:35:31,540
basically use people with extensive portfolios

9949
11:35:31,540 --> 11:35:33,540
or

9950
11:35:33,540 --> 11:35:35,540
work history, etc.

9951
11:35:35,540 --> 11:35:37,540
You know what, I just did the same.

9952
11:35:37,540 --> 11:35:39,540
Love that the codes give free shipping right now.

9953
11:35:39,540 --> 11:35:41,540
Yeah, if you want to test out,

9954
11:35:41,540 --> 11:35:43,540
you can get free shipping gold.

9955
11:35:45,540 --> 11:35:47,540
If you're the big spin,

9956
11:35:47,540 --> 11:35:49,540
would you kindly give this refill?

9957
11:35:49,540 --> 11:35:51,540
No, she can reach around. Please and thank you.

9958
11:35:51,540 --> 11:35:53,540
Since she said please.

9959
11:35:53,540 --> 11:35:55,540
I'm still here enjoying the stream.

9960
11:35:55,540 --> 11:35:57,540
I forgot to do a main story

9961
11:35:57,540 --> 11:35:59,540
on my new game plus character.

9962
11:35:59,540 --> 11:36:01,540
So I'm going to catch up and be shy tomorrow.

9963
11:36:01,540 --> 11:36:03,540
Love you to be slim.

9964
11:36:03,540 --> 11:36:05,540
Yeah, don't be shy to stream snipe.

9965
11:36:05,540 --> 11:36:07,540
I ain't going to beat you up.

9966
11:36:07,540 --> 11:36:09,540
And if you die, please don't be embarrassed.

9967
11:36:09,540 --> 11:36:11,540
I literally cannot even play this game.

9968
11:36:11,540 --> 11:36:13,540
I will say it again.

9969
11:36:13,540 --> 11:36:15,540
If it wasn't for you,

9970
11:36:15,540 --> 11:36:17,540
yes, you right now listening

9971
11:36:17,540 --> 11:36:19,540
to this, I would be incapable

9972
11:36:19,540 --> 11:36:21,540
of playing this game.

9973
11:36:21,540 --> 11:36:23,540
This game would be locked away from me due to skill.

9974
11:36:23,540 --> 11:36:25,540
And no, I'm not embarrassed

9975
11:36:25,540 --> 11:36:27,540
to admit it. No.

9976
11:36:27,540 --> 11:36:29,540
It does not upset me to admit

9977
11:36:29,540 --> 11:36:31,540
that I can't play this game on my own.

9978
11:36:31,540 --> 11:36:33,540
It is the truth.

9979
11:36:33,540 --> 11:36:35,540
And it's

9980
11:36:35,540 --> 11:36:37,540
very nice that we can play it together.

9981
11:36:37,540 --> 11:36:39,540
It's subnautica stream snipe.

9982
11:36:39,540 --> 11:36:41,540
You're saying subnautica is a riot.

9983
11:36:41,540 --> 11:36:43,540
Is it multiplayer?

9984
11:36:45,540 --> 11:36:47,540
Or did I misunderstand your sentence

9985
11:36:47,540 --> 11:36:49,540
and I just got excited?

9986
11:36:49,540 --> 11:36:51,540
No, it's not.

9987
11:36:55,540 --> 11:36:57,540
Just taken.

9988
11:36:59,540 --> 11:37:01,540
You got my hopes up there.

9989
11:37:01,540 --> 11:37:03,540
Could you hear it in my voice?

9990
11:37:03,540 --> 11:37:05,540
I was like, I stream snipe.

9991
11:37:05,540 --> 11:37:07,540
Okay, sorry.

9992
11:37:07,540 --> 11:37:09,540
There's the mod, but no.

9993
11:37:09,540 --> 11:37:11,540
Time to go, mommy got anime towards you.

9994
11:37:11,540 --> 11:37:13,540
Rest well, enjoy your anime.

9995
11:37:13,540 --> 11:37:15,540
Are you squinting me right now?

9996
11:37:15,540 --> 11:37:17,540
Love you, mama.

9997
11:37:17,540 --> 11:37:19,540
Wishing you a big hug.

9998
11:37:19,540 --> 11:37:21,540
I can't really hug this microphone.

9999
11:37:21,540 --> 11:37:23,540
At least with the 3D, I can prove I'm hugging it

10000
11:37:23,540 --> 11:37:25,540
because I can make you listen to my heart.

10001
11:37:25,540 --> 11:37:27,540
Which is proof that I'm hugging.

10002
11:37:27,540 --> 11:37:29,540
Thank you anonymous for the tips.

10003
11:37:29,540 --> 11:37:31,540
I'll be back.

10004
11:37:33,540 --> 11:37:35,540
Wow, wow, wow.

10005
11:37:37,540 --> 11:37:39,540
I fixed the trainer wiefling so it doesn't have

10006
11:37:39,540 --> 11:37:41,540
a strange box around it.

10007
11:37:41,540 --> 11:37:43,540
Wait, you already fixed the ammo?

10008
11:37:43,540 --> 11:37:45,540
Second?

10009
11:37:45,540 --> 11:37:47,540
Oh my god.

10010
11:37:47,540 --> 11:37:49,540
Wait, no, it has to be like the same...

10011
11:37:51,540 --> 11:37:53,540
What's the word?

10012
11:37:55,540 --> 11:37:57,540
The same width and height or YouTube don't accept it?

10013
11:38:01,540 --> 11:38:03,540
I don't know how to explain it.

10014
11:38:03,540 --> 11:38:05,540
It has to be the same width or height

10015
11:38:05,540 --> 11:38:07,540
or YouTube says no.

10016
11:38:07,540 --> 11:38:09,540
Go away.

10017
11:38:09,540 --> 11:38:11,540
Wait.

10018
11:38:11,540 --> 11:38:13,540
You already did it right? What the heck?

10019
11:38:13,540 --> 11:38:15,540
No, no, you didn't get it right.

10020
11:38:15,540 --> 11:38:17,540
The aspect image ratio has to be

10021
11:38:17,540 --> 11:38:19,540
one for one, unfortunately,

10022
11:38:19,540 --> 11:38:21,540
or else it doesn't work out.

10023
11:38:21,540 --> 11:38:23,540
So you're getting squished up wiefling chain

10024
11:38:23,540 --> 11:38:25,540
and won't get rekt.

10025
11:38:25,540 --> 11:38:27,540
And you'll like it, okay?

10026
11:38:27,540 --> 11:38:29,540
Extensive portfolio.

10027
11:38:29,540 --> 11:38:31,540
What if I forget project management?

10028
11:38:31,540 --> 11:38:33,540
There's main different industries.

10029
11:38:35,540 --> 11:38:37,540
We don't actually need any more staff right now.

10030
11:38:37,540 --> 11:38:39,540
We might need staff for expanding engine too.

10031
11:38:39,540 --> 11:38:41,540
I don't know. It depends what happens.

10032
11:38:41,540 --> 11:38:43,540
So I'm still streaming every day for a year.

10033
11:38:43,540 --> 11:38:45,540
I don't know when Gen 2 pop out.

10034
11:38:45,540 --> 11:38:47,540
I'm probably not streaming every single day.

10035
11:38:47,540 --> 11:38:49,540
I don't know.

10036
11:38:49,540 --> 11:38:51,540
We'll see what happens.

10037
11:38:55,540 --> 11:38:57,540
If Gen 2

10038
11:38:57,540 --> 11:38:59,540
just happened to be completely

10039
11:38:59,540 --> 11:39:01,540
independent creators that thrive,

10040
11:39:01,540 --> 11:39:03,540
then, well, I don't really need

10041
11:39:03,540 --> 11:39:05,540
to take any dudes off.

10042
11:39:05,540 --> 11:39:07,540
Because

10043
11:39:07,540 --> 11:39:09,540
we're getting a manager

10044
11:39:09,540 --> 11:39:11,540
and the audio manager's in place.

10045
11:39:11,540 --> 11:39:13,540
My only responsibilities

10046
11:39:13,540 --> 11:39:15,540
are going to be whittled down to

10047
11:39:15,540 --> 11:39:17,540
do you want to help with scripts, yes or no?

10048
11:39:17,540 --> 11:39:19,540
Do you want to help with content analysis, yes or no?

10049
11:39:19,540 --> 11:39:21,540
That's literally me.

10050
11:39:23,540 --> 11:39:25,540
As for what we need for Gen 2,

10051
11:39:25,540 --> 11:39:27,540
I have

10052
11:39:27,540 --> 11:39:29,540
a second manager just in case,

10053
11:39:29,540 --> 11:39:31,540
but obviously

10054
11:39:31,540 --> 11:39:33,540
with this is the way it works.

10055
11:39:33,540 --> 11:39:35,540
I need an audio editor that I need.

10056
11:39:35,540 --> 11:39:37,540
I need an audio editor that's already got

10057
11:39:37,540 --> 11:39:39,540
history and proof that they edit.

10058
11:39:39,540 --> 11:39:41,540
And the problem is, it's so rare

10059
11:39:41,540 --> 11:39:43,540
to have ASMR audio

10060
11:39:43,540 --> 11:39:45,540
experiencing edit.

10061
11:39:45,540 --> 11:39:47,540
It's so rare in a portfolio.

10062
11:39:49,540 --> 11:39:51,540
So it's next impossible to find people

10063
11:39:51,540 --> 11:39:53,540
and it's next impossible to get hired

10064
11:39:53,540 --> 11:39:55,540
for such a niche unless you offered

10065
11:39:55,540 --> 11:39:57,540
your services. The only thing I can

10066
11:39:57,540 --> 11:39:59,540
think of to expand your portfolio

10067
11:39:59,540 --> 11:40:01,540
into what we need

10068
11:40:01,540 --> 11:40:03,540
is you offer

10069
11:40:03,540 --> 11:40:05,540
for

10070
11:40:07,540 --> 11:40:09,540
a smaller creator that might not have time

10071
11:40:09,540 --> 11:40:11,540
to edit their own ASMRs or whatever.

10072
11:40:11,540 --> 11:40:13,540
Just offer it and be like,

10073
11:40:13,540 --> 11:40:15,540
I'm looking for experience because I'm looking

10074
11:40:15,540 --> 11:40:17,540
to get hired in the ASMR thingy

10075
11:40:17,540 --> 11:40:19,540
and I want to offer it for free and see how it goes.

10076
11:40:19,540 --> 11:40:21,540
That's the only way I can see what I need.

10077
11:40:21,540 --> 11:40:23,540
But I need audio editors

10078
11:40:23,540 --> 11:40:25,540
both for ASMR and both for regular

10079
11:40:25,540 --> 11:40:27,540
audio roleplay.

10080
11:40:27,540 --> 11:40:29,540
So we should remember

10081
11:40:29,540 --> 11:40:31,540
to savor the daily stream.

10082
11:40:31,540 --> 11:40:33,540
It depends.

10083
11:40:33,540 --> 11:40:35,540
So if Gen 2

10084
11:40:35,540 --> 11:40:37,540
happens to be fully

10085
11:40:37,540 --> 11:40:39,540
independent

10086
11:40:39,540 --> 11:40:41,540
or

10087
11:40:41,540 --> 11:40:43,540
they're not needy, they know what to do next,

10088
11:40:43,540 --> 11:40:45,540
they know how to analyse content

10089
11:40:47,540 --> 11:40:49,540
then really

10090
11:40:49,540 --> 11:40:51,540
I'm next to useless.

10091
11:40:51,540 --> 11:40:53,540
At this point in time, I have

10092
11:40:53,540 --> 11:40:55,540
scripts to write for Shibi and

10093
11:40:55,540 --> 11:40:57,540
Amy

10094
11:40:57,540 --> 11:40:59,540
on YouTube in some shorts

10095
11:40:59,540 --> 11:41:01,540
and that's literally it.

10096
11:41:01,540 --> 11:41:03,540
That's all my background

10097
11:41:03,540 --> 11:41:05,540
work right now.

10098
11:41:07,540 --> 11:41:09,540
Because the audio

10099
11:41:09,540 --> 11:41:11,540
Patreon person has come in, like audio manager

10100
11:41:11,540 --> 11:41:13,540
I don't know what you want to call them.

10101
11:41:13,540 --> 11:41:15,540
So if Gen 2

10102
11:41:15,540 --> 11:41:17,540
came on and they were like,

10103
11:41:17,540 --> 11:41:19,540
I need this, I would like this, I would like that.

10104
11:41:19,540 --> 11:41:21,540
That's different.

10105
11:41:21,540 --> 11:41:23,540
That would be like, well

10106
11:41:23,540 --> 11:41:25,540
I need to...

10107
11:41:25,540 --> 11:41:27,540
Shani don't say you're useless.

10108
11:41:27,540 --> 11:41:29,540
Not useless in that way, just like

10109
11:41:29,540 --> 11:41:31,540
there's no thing for me to do.

10110
11:41:31,540 --> 11:41:33,540
Sorry, I'm probably not the best at articulating

10111
11:41:33,540 --> 11:41:35,540
what I need to say right now.

10112
11:41:35,540 --> 11:41:37,540
I know, shocking.

10113
11:41:37,540 --> 11:41:39,540
12 hour stream, been up since midnight

10114
11:41:39,540 --> 11:41:41,540
and I unable to articulate myself

10115
11:41:41,540 --> 11:41:43,540
well, who would've guessed?

10116
11:41:45,540 --> 11:41:47,540
Hi Cuddles, your model's so expressive.

10117
11:41:47,540 --> 11:41:49,540
Are you still running non-calibrated

10118
11:41:49,540 --> 11:41:51,540
to your face? Yeah.

10119
11:41:51,540 --> 11:41:53,540
I still haven't done it.

10120
11:41:53,540 --> 11:41:55,540
I'm sorry.

10121
11:41:55,540 --> 11:41:57,540
It's not calibrated to my face.

10122
11:41:57,540 --> 11:41:59,540
I'm sorry.

10123
11:41:59,540 --> 11:42:01,540
I can do a lot.

10124
11:42:01,540 --> 11:42:03,540
I still frog blink because I didn't calibrate

10125
11:42:03,540 --> 11:42:05,540
the eyes, that's why I randomly

10126
11:42:05,540 --> 11:42:07,540
frog blink. Even though

10127
11:42:07,540 --> 11:42:09,540
I'm not frog blinking in your life.

10128
11:42:11,540 --> 11:42:13,540
It's okay, we get you.

10129
11:42:13,540 --> 11:42:15,540
Mummy, it's almost time limit. What's the time limit?

10130
11:42:15,540 --> 11:42:17,540
55 minutes?

10131
11:42:17,540 --> 11:42:19,540
So it only gets better?

10132
11:42:19,540 --> 11:42:21,540
Yeah, basically.

10133
11:42:23,540 --> 11:42:25,540
One minute,

10134
11:42:25,540 --> 11:42:27,540
there was a joke about the gooch being called

10135
11:42:27,540 --> 11:42:29,540
a backboard and you seem confused.

10136
11:42:29,540 --> 11:42:31,540
So here's examples.

10137
11:42:31,540 --> 11:42:33,540
Wait, what? You sent me a picture of your asshole?

10138
11:42:37,540 --> 11:42:39,540
Wait, it's an MP4 file?

10139
11:42:41,540 --> 11:42:43,540
Did you send me a video

10140
11:42:43,540 --> 11:42:45,540
of your arse? Be honest, Riflin.

10141
11:42:45,540 --> 11:42:47,540
Oh, it's Hentai.

10142
11:42:47,540 --> 11:42:49,540
Okay.

10143
11:42:53,540 --> 11:42:55,540
I just went straight for that.

10144
11:42:55,540 --> 11:42:57,540
There's no other logical explanation

10145
11:42:57,540 --> 11:42:59,540
to what this cat box file is.

10146
11:42:59,540 --> 11:43:01,540
It has to be you. It was Hentai.

10147
11:43:01,540 --> 11:43:03,540
Sorry about that, Riflin.

10148
11:43:03,540 --> 11:43:05,540
Sorry.

10149
11:43:05,540 --> 11:43:07,540
My apologies.

10150
11:43:07,540 --> 11:43:09,540
Are you disappointed or relieved?

10151
11:43:09,540 --> 11:43:11,540
I was scared, but I still opened up the file anyway.

10152
11:43:11,540 --> 11:43:13,540
Always look at it.

10153
11:43:13,540 --> 11:43:15,540
It was just Hentai.

10154
11:43:15,540 --> 11:43:17,540
Why do you think of lollipops?

10155
11:43:17,540 --> 11:43:19,540
My shells!

10156
11:43:19,540 --> 11:43:21,540
They're transparent and perilous

10157
11:43:21,540 --> 11:43:23,540
and they change colour

10158
11:43:23,540 --> 11:43:25,540
and they hue shift and all that.

10159
11:43:25,540 --> 11:43:27,540
Although they might not do it when my models react

10160
11:43:27,540 --> 11:43:29,540
as they probably don't hue shift as much.

10161
11:43:29,540 --> 11:43:31,540
Hello, nice to meet you.

10162
11:43:31,540 --> 11:43:33,540
Beep boop, I too am a bot.

10163
11:43:35,540 --> 11:43:37,540
Should we see if you can

10164
11:43:37,540 --> 11:43:39,540
do the full calibration of the model

10165
11:43:39,540 --> 11:43:41,540
in the future? Are you joking?

10166
11:43:41,540 --> 11:43:43,540
I have no idea how to do that.

10167
11:43:43,540 --> 11:43:45,540
I have no idea.

10168
11:43:45,540 --> 11:43:47,540
I've no got a Scooby-Doo

10169
11:43:47,540 --> 11:43:49,540
and what to do.

10170
11:43:53,540 --> 11:43:55,540
She's braver than me

10171
11:43:55,540 --> 11:43:57,540
and hard to draw.

10172
11:43:57,540 --> 11:43:59,540
You don't like my lollipop?

10173
11:43:59,540 --> 11:44:01,540
After one year of straight shoo-min,

10174
11:44:01,540 --> 11:44:03,540
it would be a huge change in adjustment to stream length.

10175
11:44:03,540 --> 11:44:05,540
That's what I'm worried about.

10176
11:44:05,540 --> 11:44:07,540
About me, we'd miss you for sure,

10177
11:44:07,540 --> 11:44:09,540
but you could finally probably rest,

10178
11:44:09,540 --> 11:44:11,540
so I just wish you have the strength and health

10179
11:44:11,540 --> 11:44:13,540
to do it.

10180
11:44:13,540 --> 11:44:15,540
As I said, when I go outside,

10181
11:44:15,540 --> 11:44:17,540
thankfully I don't have to go outside recently all.

10182
11:44:19,540 --> 11:44:21,540
The only thing I need to go outside again

10183
11:44:21,540 --> 11:44:23,540
for is my skin check,

10184
11:44:23,540 --> 11:44:25,540
which I've not booked the appointment for.

10185
11:44:25,540 --> 11:44:27,540
They just need to check

10186
11:44:27,540 --> 11:44:29,540
if they need to cut anything out of my skin

10187
11:44:29,540 --> 11:44:31,540
because I'm in the land of the sun

10188
11:44:31,540 --> 11:44:33,540
and it's super dangerous here.

10189
11:44:35,540 --> 11:44:37,540
The food delivery today was fun.

10190
11:44:37,540 --> 11:44:39,540
That's my only exposure to getting sick

10191
11:44:39,540 --> 11:44:41,540
unless Gimli and Vigo

10192
11:44:41,540 --> 11:44:43,540
pass something on to me from the garden.

10193
11:44:45,540 --> 11:44:47,540
I don't really have

10194
11:44:47,540 --> 11:44:49,540
the capacity

10195
11:44:49,540 --> 11:44:51,540
to become sick.

10196
11:44:51,540 --> 11:44:53,540
Capacity is the wrong word.

10197
11:44:53,540 --> 11:44:55,540
The opportunity to become sick,

10198
11:44:55,540 --> 11:44:57,540
opportunity is also the wrong word,

10199
11:44:57,540 --> 11:44:59,540
but I am very minimally

10200
11:44:59,540 --> 11:45:01,540
exposed to outside sources,

10201
11:45:01,540 --> 11:45:03,540
which means I

10202
11:45:03,540 --> 11:45:05,540
most likely will not fall ill

10203
11:45:05,540 --> 11:45:07,540
and even if I did fall ill,

10204
11:45:07,540 --> 11:45:09,540
I do know for a fact

10205
11:45:09,540 --> 11:45:11,540
I'm a boot-up balutrile

10206
11:45:11,540 --> 11:45:13,540
and get you to hold my hand

10207
11:45:13,540 --> 11:45:15,540
through every single hand of cards I play.

10208
11:45:15,540 --> 11:45:17,540
Vulnerability,

10209
11:45:17,540 --> 11:45:19,540
that's the word, vulnerability.

10210
11:45:19,540 --> 11:45:21,540
Mummy turns into Catwoman.

10211
11:45:21,540 --> 11:45:23,540
Cat Scratches can do it.

10212
11:45:23,540 --> 11:45:25,540
I use antiseptic

10213
11:45:25,540 --> 11:45:27,540
if there's ever an accident

10214
11:45:27,540 --> 11:45:29,540
with the pooders when we play.

10215
11:45:29,540 --> 11:45:31,540
Mummy, I saw this and thought of you.

10216
11:45:31,540 --> 11:45:33,540
Obviously the tail would be a tentacle,

10217
11:45:33,540 --> 11:45:35,540
but I think you have a picture.

10218
11:45:35,540 --> 11:45:37,540
What?

10219
11:45:37,540 --> 11:45:39,540
None of this card.

10220
11:45:39,540 --> 11:45:41,540
What are you sending me?

10221
11:45:41,540 --> 11:45:43,540
Monka?

10222
11:45:47,540 --> 11:45:49,540
Yeah, that's a good suck at this one.

10223
11:45:49,540 --> 11:45:51,540
I like that one.

10224
11:45:55,540 --> 11:45:57,540
No more opening up the infield.

10225
11:45:59,540 --> 11:46:01,540
Please don't forget to wear pants,

10226
11:46:01,540 --> 11:46:03,540
when going out.

10227
11:46:03,540 --> 11:46:05,540
If all else fails,

10228
11:46:05,540 --> 11:46:07,540
I volunteer my fate real.

10229
11:46:07,540 --> 11:46:09,540
Should be playing balutrile sick in bed

10230
11:46:09,540 --> 11:46:11,540
when it comes. I mean, I could stream...

10231
11:46:11,540 --> 11:46:13,540
Oh no, I couldn't.

10232
11:46:13,540 --> 11:46:15,540
I have to stream in a PC.

10233
11:46:15,540 --> 11:46:17,540
Why did I think I could stream from a bed?

10234
11:46:17,540 --> 11:46:19,540
I would have to move my...

10235
11:46:19,540 --> 11:46:21,540
Okay, wow.

10236
11:46:21,540 --> 11:46:23,540
Maybe...

10237
11:46:23,540 --> 11:46:25,540
I don't know. I could probably just do an ASMR stream

10238
11:46:25,540 --> 11:46:27,540
in the bath if I'm sick

10239
11:46:27,540 --> 11:46:29,540
and try and air out my airways and stuff.

10240
11:46:29,540 --> 11:46:31,540
If all else fails,

10241
11:46:31,540 --> 11:46:33,540
there's a soiled loincloth.

10242
11:46:33,540 --> 11:46:35,540
Bruh, that was crazy.

10243
11:46:35,540 --> 11:46:37,540
10 minutes.

10244
11:46:37,540 --> 11:46:39,540
Phone, PNG stream?

10245
11:46:39,540 --> 11:46:41,540
Is that a thing? Can be to Brazil?

10246
11:46:45,540 --> 11:46:47,540
You aren't useless, you're my favourite puppy girl.

10247
11:46:47,540 --> 11:46:49,540
I would do that,

10248
11:46:49,540 --> 11:46:51,540
but it really hurts my voice box to pant right now.

10249
11:46:53,540 --> 11:46:55,540
Hi, mommie. Do you have an oshi?

10250
11:46:55,540 --> 11:46:57,540
Do you still have time to watch others?

10251
11:46:57,540 --> 11:46:59,540
What do you do to relax?

10252
11:46:59,540 --> 11:47:01,540
I don't

10253
11:47:01,540 --> 11:47:03,540
relax!

10254
11:47:05,540 --> 11:47:07,540
Everything

10255
11:47:07,540 --> 11:47:09,540
is work

10256
11:47:09,540 --> 11:47:11,540
and trying my best for you.

10257
11:47:11,540 --> 11:47:13,540
I watch video game reviews

10258
11:47:13,540 --> 11:47:15,540
to see if there's a new game

10259
11:47:15,540 --> 11:47:17,540
that I might like to play with you

10260
11:47:17,540 --> 11:47:19,540
or a new game that I want to play in general

10261
11:47:19,540 --> 11:47:21,540
on screen.

10262
11:47:21,540 --> 11:47:23,540
On stream, pardon me.

10263
11:47:23,540 --> 11:47:25,540
I don't have time to watch

10264
11:47:25,540 --> 11:47:27,540
any other

10265
11:47:27,540 --> 11:47:29,540
VTuber at all, not even a stream.

10266
11:47:29,540 --> 11:47:31,540
I did a RuneScape

10267
11:47:31,540 --> 11:47:33,540
reacting to my gen mates content

10268
11:47:33,540 --> 11:47:35,540
because I don't even have time to watch

10269
11:47:35,540 --> 11:47:37,540
my gen mates, which is a shame.

10270
11:47:41,540 --> 11:47:43,540
The only guilty pleasure

10271
11:47:43,540 --> 11:47:45,540
that I have at the moment when I do find

10272
11:47:45,540 --> 11:47:47,540
time, and I can't even

10273
11:47:47,540 --> 11:47:49,540
complete full episodes,

10274
11:47:49,540 --> 11:47:51,540
there's this show

10275
11:47:51,540 --> 11:47:53,540
called the Financial Hammer and people

10276
11:47:53,540 --> 11:47:55,540
come on and they have debt issues

10277
11:47:55,540 --> 11:47:57,540
and spending habit issues

10278
11:47:57,540 --> 11:47:59,540
and addictions or whatever

10279
11:47:59,540 --> 11:48:01,540
to spend and then

10280
11:48:01,540 --> 11:48:03,540
this guy goes like

10281
11:48:03,540 --> 11:48:05,540
what are you doing? You're in debt!

10282
11:48:05,540 --> 11:48:07,540
Stop buying these frivolous

10283
11:48:07,540 --> 11:48:09,540
things!

10284
11:48:09,540 --> 11:48:11,540
That's my guilty pleasure at the

10285
11:48:11,540 --> 11:48:13,540
moment.

10286
11:48:13,540 --> 11:48:15,540
There was a guy on it recently

10287
11:48:15,540 --> 11:48:17,540
and he unfortunately

10288
11:48:17,540 --> 11:48:19,540
needs a bit of mental health

10289
11:48:19,540 --> 11:48:21,540
help.

10290
11:48:21,540 --> 11:48:23,540
He's got a way of communicating and his

10291
11:48:23,540 --> 11:48:25,540
perception of reality caught my eye

10292
11:48:25,540 --> 11:48:27,540
because I was like oh that's interesting

10293
11:48:27,540 --> 11:48:29,540
because his perception of reality

10294
11:48:29,540 --> 11:48:31,540
has warped. Five minutes?

10295
11:48:31,540 --> 11:48:33,540
I'll stop yapping about a different

10296
11:48:33,540 --> 11:48:35,540
YouTube show.

10297
11:48:35,540 --> 11:48:37,540
As for an Oshidaes

10298
11:48:37,540 --> 11:48:39,540
let's just say my gen

10299
11:48:39,540 --> 11:48:41,540
mates honestly. Not to be

10300
11:48:41,540 --> 11:48:43,540
biased, but my gen mates

10301
11:48:43,540 --> 11:48:45,540
unironically, I just

10302
11:48:45,540 --> 11:48:47,540
love them to bits, I love them to pieces.

10303
11:48:47,540 --> 11:48:49,540
You know

10304
11:48:49,540 --> 11:48:51,540
I can catch maybe

10305
11:48:51,540 --> 11:48:53,540
five minutes of a session.

10306
11:48:53,540 --> 11:48:55,540
Sometimes if I have a shorter stream

10307
11:48:55,540 --> 11:48:57,540
I catch mercy quite a lot because mercy is

10308
11:48:57,540 --> 11:48:59,540
really good for me when I'm kind of wrapping

10309
11:48:59,540 --> 11:49:01,540
up the end of my day.

10310
11:49:01,540 --> 11:49:03,540
God, six minutes.

10311
11:49:03,540 --> 11:49:05,540
Mummy, could you please hum

10312
11:49:05,540 --> 11:49:07,540
the Reeflings to Sleep?

10313
11:49:07,540 --> 11:49:09,540
What do you want me to hum? I've forgotten

10314
11:49:09,540 --> 11:49:11,540
how Legend of Zelda goes.

10315
11:49:17,540 --> 11:49:19,540
The Listerine?

10316
11:49:19,540 --> 11:49:21,540
Yeah, for accuracy.

10317
11:49:21,540 --> 11:49:23,540
I don't know how to

10318
11:49:23,540 --> 11:49:25,540
hum.

10319
11:49:25,540 --> 11:49:27,540
Klerushaka

10320
11:49:27,540 --> 11:49:29,540
Klerushaka

10321
11:49:29,540 --> 11:49:31,540
Domenzu

10322
11:49:31,540 --> 11:49:33,540
Domenzu

10323
11:49:33,540 --> 11:49:35,540
Sone la matina

10324
11:49:35,540 --> 11:49:37,540
Sone la matina

10325
11:49:37,540 --> 11:49:39,540
Ding ding dong

10326
11:49:39,540 --> 11:49:41,540
Ding ding dong

10327
11:49:41,540 --> 11:49:43,540
Why is this dealer?

10328
11:49:43,540 --> 11:49:45,540
Why is this dealer?

10329
11:49:45,540 --> 11:49:47,540
Why is this dealer?

10330
11:49:47,540 --> 11:49:49,540
Taking the piss?

10331
11:49:49,540 --> 11:49:51,540
I've been standing here

10332
11:49:51,540 --> 11:49:53,540
for three minutes.

10333
11:49:53,540 --> 11:49:55,540
Why is this dealer?

10334
11:49:55,540 --> 11:49:57,540
Taking the piss? I've been standing here.

10335
11:49:57,540 --> 11:49:59,540
I need

10336
11:49:59,540 --> 11:50:01,540
my things.

10337
11:50:01,540 --> 11:50:03,540
That's all I know.

10338
11:50:03,540 --> 11:50:05,540
Are we for a moment in the human

10339
11:50:05,540 --> 11:50:07,540
singing? My voice is so shredded

10340
11:50:07,540 --> 11:50:09,540
right now, I wish I could sing a bit more.

10341
11:50:11,540 --> 11:50:13,540
Don't remind me.

10342
11:50:15,540 --> 11:50:17,540
You better off alone

10343
11:50:17,540 --> 11:50:19,540
Domenzu

10344
11:50:19,540 --> 11:50:21,540
What? Are you sent me?

10345
11:50:21,540 --> 11:50:23,540
The last reefing I sent was a fixed version

10346
11:50:23,540 --> 11:50:25,540
of the Reefling Hold and Leash since it had some odd artifact

10347
11:50:25,540 --> 11:50:27,540
but here's the remote fix. Wait, is it going to work?

10348
11:50:27,540 --> 11:50:29,540
Can I send it before the Vod breaks?

10349
11:50:29,540 --> 11:50:31,540
Oh my god

10350
11:50:31,540 --> 11:50:33,540
it's squishy. He's so squishy.

10351
11:50:33,540 --> 11:50:35,540
Hold on.

10352
11:50:35,540 --> 11:50:37,540
You're so squishy.

10353
11:50:37,540 --> 11:50:39,540
I don't know why you do that.

10354
11:50:39,540 --> 11:50:41,540
Okay, save.

10355
11:50:41,540 --> 11:50:43,540
Oh my god, that is so

10356
11:50:43,540 --> 11:50:45,540
steep.

10357
11:50:45,540 --> 11:50:47,540
YouTube is so steep when asking for

10358
11:50:47,540 --> 11:50:49,540
new emotes lots, honestly.

10359
11:50:49,540 --> 11:50:51,540
It's like

10360
11:50:51,540 --> 11:50:53,540
145 new members ships needed.

10361
11:50:53,540 --> 11:50:55,540
That is honestly insane.

10362
11:50:55,540 --> 11:50:57,540
Three minutes until Domenzu.

10363
11:50:57,540 --> 11:50:59,540
Yeah, there you go. There's a new emote.

10364
11:50:59,540 --> 11:51:01,540
Why ain't the streamer

10365
11:51:01,540 --> 11:51:03,540
taking a piss? She's been streaming

10366
11:51:03,540 --> 11:51:05,540
here for 12 hours, honestly.

10367
11:51:05,540 --> 11:51:07,540
Okay, I love

10368
11:51:07,540 --> 11:51:09,540
you.

10369
11:51:09,540 --> 11:51:11,540
Are you going to be okay if I wrap

10370
11:51:11,540 --> 11:51:13,540
it up?

10371
11:51:13,540 --> 11:51:15,540
I'll give you a kiss for every

10372
11:51:15,540 --> 11:51:17,540
Reefling that was in game.

10373
11:51:17,540 --> 11:51:19,540
I kid you not, I can do that right now.

10374
11:51:19,540 --> 11:51:21,540
Okay, one, two, three,

10375
11:51:21,540 --> 11:51:23,540

Okay, I love you Reefland, I'll see you tomorrow.
