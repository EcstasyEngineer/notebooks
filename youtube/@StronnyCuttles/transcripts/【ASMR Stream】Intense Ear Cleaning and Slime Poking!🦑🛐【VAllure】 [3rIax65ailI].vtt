00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
I'm supposed to blue play as a- I live noise game, noise filter.

00:16.000 --> 00:32.000
First thing first, I need to get close. I can't accept.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
What was your name again?

00:36.000 --> 00:52.000
It seems like your ears, oh dear, are a little bit cloned up, Mr. Wiefling.

00:52.000 --> 01:02.000
Let me just inspect this ear. Oh dear, that's good.

01:02.000 --> 01:12.000
Mr. Wiefling always really cloned up here.

01:12.000 --> 01:20.000
Oh dear, and now let me check your other ear, Mr. Wiefling.

01:20.000 --> 01:30.000
Do I sound muffled in this ear as well? Oh dear, there's something obstructing your ear canal.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
Oh, that's my, I mustn't sound so muffled.

01:36.000 --> 01:52.000
Oh wow, nurse, re-in, nurse, I see. Just came to our ear cleaning suite with our assistants, the snowberries, thank you.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
Alright, okay, I think I know what to start with.

01:58.000 --> 02:08.000
I feel like, oh sorry, Mr. Wiefling, you're not a little feeling your client at my ear cleaning facility.

02:08.000 --> 02:20.000
Okay, first thing first, we're going to do is listen to the wax that's stuck in your ears.

02:20.000 --> 02:38.000
It has an anti-fat-packed properties because ear wax is a pretty fatty substance, so just going to spray over your ear.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
Don't worry, it's wet, so it's not, it's cool.

02:50.000 --> 03:04.000
Okay, then for this ear, Mr. Wiefling, do you feel like that did anything for you?

03:04.000 --> 03:14.000
Or do you need a bit more, I think you need a bit more ear, oh dear.

03:14.000 --> 03:22.000
Okay, now that the solution on your ear, I'm just going to dry every single ear canal.

03:22.000 --> 03:32.000
Yes, your actual ear and the earwax, because I don't want you dripping my Mr. Wiefling, that's not very appropriate for this thing.

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
Okay, dear, dear, but I still sound a little old.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
You are probably the worst case I've seen in a while.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
Are you listening with headphones on?

03:50.000 --> 03:58.000
Is your day job maybe working at a PC?

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
Let me see, not so good.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
What?

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Not so good at all.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
This sound has just gotten off of my focusing.

04:14.000 --> 04:30.000
What the?

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
Right, I've taken off the fucking noise gate, back to the roleplay boys.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Oh dear.

04:38.000 --> 04:50.000
Yes, I think you may be wearing a lot of headphones, because this is the most clogged ears I've seen in a very long time.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Okay, your ear is now clean at all.

04:54.000 --> 05:04.000
I'm going to do this check here and canal and see if I can remove any debris at this point.

05:04.000 --> 05:20.000
But that is very tightly packed in.

05:20.000 --> 05:30.000
How do you think we should get rid of a good maybe ears?

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
A Japanese ear cleaning tool in combination.

05:34.000 --> 05:42.000
This is quite the challenge today, Mr. Wiefling.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
Just checking.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
Definitely a solid mass over your ear.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
I assume this ear is going to be the exact same story.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Oh yeah.

06:00.000 --> 06:08.000
I think what we'll have to do is do this day by day.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
Just take out a little bit.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
But the procedure shouldn't take more than 12 minutes, okay?

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
So don't worry, I won't steal too much of your time.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
I'm sure you're a very busy man, Mr. Wiefling.

06:24.000 --> 06:32.000
So I'm just going to try and dislodge some of the ear.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
It should be hard again.

06:36.000 --> 06:46.000
Let's see if this tool will offer a bit more texture here.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
Here.

06:52.000 --> 07:00.000
I'm just removing what I can very delicately because I don't want to hurt your ear.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
So you'll need to tell me in the hearts, okay?

07:04.000 --> 07:16.000
Because we don't want no problem.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
This isn't easy.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Okay.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
We're getting somewhere, Mr. Wiefling.

07:28.000 --> 07:40.000
Getting somewhere.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
Oh, you work in an ink factory, Mr. Wiefling.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
That's a curious job.

07:46.000 --> 07:58.000
What do you do when you work in the ink factory?

07:58.000 --> 08:06.000
Definitely get some work done.

08:06.000 --> 08:14.000
That was painful, wasn't it?

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
Your ears are already feeling some relief.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
I've actually not even cleaned one ear out fully yet.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
So I've still muffled so you guys are jumping ahead of the roleplay.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
Hold on.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
It's gone in your ear.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.000
I've put it in a creepy patch, isn't it?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
You feel the ink machine?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Oh, you feel the ink machine?

08:46.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah, I guess it probably runs on some sort of liquid that is high in vitamin D extract.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
I don't know if you guys will forget.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
Oh, you have Associates, Mr. Wiefling, that work in the production of the ink as well.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
It sounds like a very efficient factory.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
That's quite a good job.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
My job is to have one that I close pretty quickly.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
Well, of course I have my lovelaces.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
You did my appointment with the license.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Wow.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
I've almost got it actually. Hold on.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
I've literally almost got this ear clean.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
You're very close.

09:38.000 --> 09:46.000
Very close to getting this ear dislodged.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
Okay.

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
But we have to be super gentle because I don't want to hurt you.

09:56.000 --> 10:04.000
Oh, I think it's coming.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Do you hear me now, Mr. Wiefling?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Did that work?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I think it did.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Hold on. Let me just spray down your ear again.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Just so...

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Wow.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
That's perfect.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
There we go. Let me just quickly rub down your ear.

10:24.000 --> 10:30.000
And then we will tackle the other one here.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Oh, that's great.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I'm glad you feel relief in this ear.

10:34.000 --> 10:42.000
I'm just going to make sure to brush away all the debris because it might sound like your hearing is completely back.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
But your baseline, Mr. Wiefling, was very low.

10:46.000 --> 10:54.000
So I'm just going to make sure to brush away any nastiness that may have been left over, okay?

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
Because we don't want any nastiness.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I just had a cat here in your ear.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Do you have a cat, Mr. Wiefling?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Do you have two cats?

11:04.000 --> 11:10.000
What are their names?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Yeah.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
Wow. Okay, that's probably all the dust.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
And then we're super careful.

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
Just gently gently rub that.

11:28.000 --> 11:36.000
Okay, this ear, I think, I'm just going to take another look into it.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
But it looks pretty clear to me.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I will come back to it just in case.

11:42.000 --> 11:50.000
But unfortunately, this ear is still very much full and muffled.

11:50.000 --> 12:10.000
Let's see what we can do over here.

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
Oh, oh, you don't have a cat, Mr. Wiefling, but you had named them after the Fieler Girls.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
Or unfortunately, I'm not familiar with the Fieler Girls.

12:20.000 --> 12:28.000
Would you like to describe in great detail who or what the Fieler Girls are?

12:28.000 --> 12:34.000
Whilst I clean up this very troublesome ear of yours.

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
Just, again, just tell me if there's any pain and I'll stop.

12:40.000 --> 12:52.000
Because I definitely don't want to hurt you.

12:52.000 --> 13:02.000
Oh, that's bad.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
My cat's name is Wandalabism.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Interesting name for a cat.

13:06.000 --> 13:12.000
I wonder, did you come up with that by yourself?

13:12.000 --> 13:18.000
Okay, there's no pain. Good.

13:18.000 --> 13:26.000
I'm just trying to pick apart the large nerves and then I can actually clean your ears.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
Oh my goodness, this is, you're just tasting me.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
This is the most difficult case I've had in very long time.

13:34.000 --> 13:50.000
It keeps the ear clean, yeah.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
So, Mr. Wiefling, you're having a tingly experience.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Oh, that's good.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
My ear tingles can be quite relaxing.

14:02.000 --> 14:12.000
Maybe you can give me a pack for some tickles, we are.

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
One of them has warm and colored hair. It's totally not safe.

14:18.000 --> 14:26.000
Okay, one interesting girl group this sense.

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
There's a very cute little sister type and also our mummy is pretty hot.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
Oh, this sense of a very interesting girl.

14:36.000 --> 14:46.000
And it sounds like the guava base is covered.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
Mr. Wiefling, did I hear you correctly?

14:50.000 --> 14:58.000
You asked me to smell your ears.

14:58.000 --> 15:08.000
Well, this one's blocked, so I can't really tell you, but...

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Interesting.

15:10.000 --> 15:18.000
Well, the good news is you don't have any signs of infection because you can smell it.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
And I didn't smell any signs of infection.

15:22.000 --> 15:30.000
Just need to get this.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
And almost there, I really am.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
I swear you have some very difficult ears.

15:38.000 --> 15:52.000
Hold on, let me get on you too, because I don't think this is working as well as I had hoped.

15:52.000 --> 16:02.000
Wow.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
Oh, that was quite loud over here.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
We're getting there. We're almost there, Mr. Wiefling.

16:12.000 --> 16:18.000
And then you can finally hear me and my family.

16:18.000 --> 16:38.000
Okay.

16:38.000 --> 16:46.000
I think I got it.

16:46.000 --> 16:54.000
Hello, Mr. Wiefling. How can you hear me?

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
That's going well.

16:56.000 --> 17:02.000
I just need to make sure there's no remnants, because there might be some left over.

17:02.000 --> 17:10.000
Gunk is always, but I sound a little clearer.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
Oh, there we go.

17:14.000 --> 17:32.000
Clear, clear.

17:32.000 --> 17:42.000
I think everything sounds clear now. That's good, Mr. Wiefling and glad.

17:42.000 --> 17:54.000
Okay, just a quick brush up to make sure that you don't have any more dust or dirt in them.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
You should begin to go.

17:58.000 --> 18:06.000
Oh, I forgot to spray you a little bit, sir. You don't mind if I spray on you, right?

18:06.000 --> 18:16.000
There we go. Just tap the over here so that it's not bled on.

18:16.000 --> 18:24.000
And then give you a little brush brush.

18:24.000 --> 18:34.000
There we go.

18:34.000 --> 18:42.000
Wow.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
I think so, and while I'm here, never hand in a Scottish Dome.

18:46.000 --> 18:56.000
Okay, I think we did it. Your ears, Mr. Wiefling, appear clean.

18:56.000 --> 19:02.000
Very clean.

19:02.000 --> 19:08.000
Okay, goodbye.

19:08.000 --> 19:16.000
Thank you so much for your attendance at the care clinic.

19:16.000 --> 19:24.000
I hope you had a good day and that all of your issues have been resolved now.

19:24.000 --> 19:32.000
For the matter of payment, you have to give me one kiss.

19:32.000 --> 19:40.000
Mr. Wiefling, I said you have to give me one kiss.

19:40.000 --> 19:50.000
You need to kiss me. Kiss me.

19:50.000 --> 19:56.000
Good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon, my little Wiefling.

19:56.000 --> 20:02.000
Did you like my cringey roleplay? I thought I did a pretty good job.

20:02.000 --> 20:08.000
I have a confession reference. I accidentally don't want someone yesterday.

20:08.000 --> 20:14.000
And I'm 99% sure.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
Oh, pardon me.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
Oh, pardon me.

20:22.000 --> 20:28.000
I think it was dimsul. I don't want to hold you yesterday.

20:28.000 --> 20:36.000
Your dad is going to be even more confused when you claim you have five dollars. That makes him a granddad.

20:36.000 --> 20:42.000
It was good. Yeah, you liked it. Did you like it? You were all muffled.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
I wonder if I have a roleplay like that coming out soon.

20:46.000 --> 20:52.000
I said thank you for $2,000. Can I pay again?

20:52.000 --> 21:00.000
Being called Mr. Wiefling makes me feel like a big shot. I also must have lost the address.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
And then let me just check the...

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
Oh, of course it doesn't work, so I need to go into my own life struggle.

21:08.000 --> 21:14.000
What? That's me.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
Wait, why is it not displaying?

21:18.000 --> 21:26.000
And then thank you very much, Brightgo for the day and gifted memberships. We appreciate you.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
And congrats to all the Wieflings that caught one. Be nice and say thank you.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
John07, thank you for becoming a member.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
Vanished, thank you for becoming a member.

21:38.000 --> 21:46.000
Rockstar, the Avril Fluff, Jupro, Mamosa.

21:46.000 --> 21:52.000
Mamosa became a member. When did you do that?

21:52.000 --> 21:58.000
Type N and Tiki, thank you also for becoming a member. What the heck?

21:58.000 --> 22:08.000
I'm so sorry, you little Wieflings, I'm exhausted.

22:08.000 --> 22:16.000
I'm okay, but I have nine toenails now.

22:16.000 --> 22:22.000
Oh, floss, thank you for becoming a member. I appreciate you.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
I don't remember when Mamosa became a member.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
Thank you so much for becoming a member.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
I apologize about any yawns or complaints of pain.

22:34.000 --> 22:42.000
I'm online pain killers, but I'm surviving. It's not a big deal.

22:42.000 --> 22:52.000
Am I allowed to say the story or pour one out from all me the toenail?

22:52.000 --> 23:02.000
You were sacrificed in the name of pretty feet and you went out the way mommy wanted ya to be sexy.

23:02.000 --> 23:12.000
I definitely need a big sleep. I did get one, but I think it's one of those.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
I need rest and recovery sleep.

23:16.000 --> 23:26.000
The pointy tool was a bit surprising. I definitely felt that going into my tool.

23:26.000 --> 23:42.000
I felt that basically once they tested if I could feel anything, once it came through and I was like, no, I don't feel anything.

23:42.000 --> 23:50.000
They got to work and they said, lie back, you don't want to see this.

23:50.000 --> 24:06.000
It's currently covered up right now and I need to change it in less than 48 hours so I get to see what the damage is.

24:06.000 --> 24:14.000
They've given me a medical bag of gauze and everything to take away, but I know how to clean and change bandages.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
It's not a big deal.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
Whatever you want to call it.

24:20.000 --> 24:26.000
Strongly the one K.A smart video was amazing. You liked it.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I'll need a check actually.

24:28.000 --> 24:37.000
So YouTube put limited ads on my let me hold it video and then I was like, I'll find that's fair because of the content.

24:37.000 --> 24:43.000
But on a whim, I applied to get limited ad taken off it and they gave me it.

24:43.000 --> 24:51.000
So I've just lost like 40,000 views worth of like generated ad revenue that would have paid for that artwork.

24:51.000 --> 25:01.000
Thank you for becoming a member. I appreciate it.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
Yes, chat is so great.

25:05.000 --> 25:13.000
Abba tea, abba dye, rip strongy feet fans, well she be and Emma work again.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
So you don't have to worry.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
But I apologize for yours. I am a very sleepy baby.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
But we are going also. Thank you.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
I say for the rage goodness gravy. I can't.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Sorry. I've only takes off.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
I'll just pop you down in my lap.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
I've literally sweat up and only takes off.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
It's so damp in here.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
I was trying to do the roleplay right.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
I can't take it. I can't get it.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
It's not okay. This is so wet.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
What?

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Would you never do a ridicule again?

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
Oh, I have no intention of doing one.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Like I was going to do for a month on a phone.

26:03.000 --> 26:09.000
I was going to do like these pictures and be like this says for feet people only.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Yeah, feet people ain't getting fit.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
Nothing. Nothing.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
My hair looks like watermelon candy.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
Heck yeah, it does.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
A story called ACMA.

26:25.000 --> 26:31.000
I've said this before but they were called the twins in development.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
Or I dubbed them the twins in development.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
Why you ask? Because I don't know.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
It just came naturally to me to call them the twins.

26:41.000 --> 26:47.000
They are called.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
How much for the glove?

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
It's so sweaty and it's terrible.

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
My hand can breathe now.

26:57.000 --> 27:03.000
But I also have this box of like weird bailet slime.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I don't, let me get it.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
I was going to bet it.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Even if I had to ASMR stream.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Oh, sorry, sorry.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
I bought this weird box of slime.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Hold on.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
What?

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
It's so good.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
It sounds really bad but I just have all my figurines

27:31.000 --> 27:37.000
wink wink on display in this room.

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
Okay, Bono has got that light plastic on it.

27:43.000 --> 27:51.000
I'm going to turn down the volume.

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
I'm going to cut the slime.

28:21.000 --> 28:31.000
The black.

28:31.000 --> 28:37.000
Okay, I think I can fit the volume up again.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
What the fuck is this?

28:41.000 --> 28:47.000
So I was supposed to put this on your ear.

28:47.000 --> 28:53.000
Did you hear what this is?

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
Oh, it's sticky.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
This isn't slime all.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
I was supposed to put it on your ear.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
Just even make a noise.

29:09.000 --> 29:17.000
Do you hear that?

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
It sounds like nothing is shit.

29:19.000 --> 29:27.000
I'm going to scum ass.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
Mommy, I always thought that you are that person

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
to interview the girls.

29:35.000 --> 29:41.000
Did that sexual harassment?

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
Wait, so does this slime not do anything?

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Wait, hold on.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
I'm taking my headset off so I can hear it.

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
Oh my god, it's so sticky.

29:55.000 --> 30:01.000
Why?

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
It's going everywhere as well.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
I'm going to have to clean all of this.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
The future person must not stream live.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
Click, no clickbait.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
Okay, I'm just going to use my finger.

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
Hold on.

30:25.000 --> 30:31.000
It's on me now.

30:31.000 --> 30:43.000
What does that sound like?

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Do you hear it just sounds like

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
slightly sticky sounds?

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
I paid like all $12 for this.

30:51.000 --> 31:01.000
I don't know, maybe it's one of those tingle sounds

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
that are better for like layering with other ASMR.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
Like this.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
How's Gimli?

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
Actually, Fiko snuck in at the room.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
He's not supposed to be in here.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
And this freaking tail was hanging off the window

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
literally like three minutes before moving upstream.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
And I was like, get it out.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
Because they're not supposed to be in this room at all.

31:33.000 --> 31:39.000
Because I've got far too much equipment in here.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Yeah, it's kind of low.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
Wow, it just kind of sounds like plastic.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
Oh, it's supposed to kill my hands.

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
It's supposed to kill my nose.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Oh, we're done.

31:55.000 --> 32:05.000
I'll just put it on this used napkin from a week ago.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
I'll record with it.

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
Maybe I can use it as a layer to take an experience.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
$12.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Let me hold it.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Let me.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Oh, yucky.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
Oh, there's like a residue on my hands now.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Oh.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
I actually...

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
Sorry, I'm trying to get the residue on my hands.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
How much for that napkin?

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
It's not real. It's not my own.

32:49.000 --> 32:55.000
It's like both my pinkies are all black.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Okay.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
I'll put it on for more e-paste.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
You don't need to go on a page for more.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Right, where's my...

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Oh, here it is.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
My god.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
It's my little...

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
I don't know if you guys like tapping like that.

33:23.000 --> 33:29.000
Just testing your hearing now after your little...

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Is today the watch along?

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
It should be unless I completely messed up.

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
I actually had to leave.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
I was putting up my streams for the week.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
And then I was like, oh, should I slow?

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
I have to go for my doctor's appointment.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
So I just disappeared.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
And all I've got up is...

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Wait, I've up at the...

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Yeah.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
It's a Transformers...

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Autobots...

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Fallout.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
It's like both lane.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Yeah.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
We're watching Transformers.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
The first one with Sam Webuki.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
So congrats if your name is...

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
It's scheduled for 4.15pm.

34:27.000 --> 34:33.000
That is probably why it's at the horrifically wrong time.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
It should be 6.15am.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Lol.

34:37.000 --> 34:43.000
Okay, I've just updated the member watch along.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Does it look right on your hand now?

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Smile.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
I think I've put the wrong time for the Minish Cap as well.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Actually, hold on.

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
Yeah, I've put 4pm instead of 4am for the Minish Cap.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Don't mess.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
I'm not very brave, am I?

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
I can't wait to show you guys.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Actually, I'll show you right now.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Oh, no, I can't.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Because I don't think I have a...

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Transformers...

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
AC...

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
What the fuck, AC?

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Call her again, Ben.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
What?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Is AC's Twitter down?

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
AC, what did you do?

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
Your account is logged after a careful review.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
With the damage your account broke, some brails on Twitter.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Your account is read only movement tunes.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
You can't pause, read post-release content.

35:49.000 --> 35:55.000
Most accounts regain fill access in a week, but it could take longer.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
AC, what did she do?

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
What the fuck did she do, yeah?

36:07.000 --> 36:17.000
You know what it feels like?

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
What?

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
I'm sorry if you heard that.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
I wanted to shut my thumbnails off.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Ready?

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
She became too powerful, actually.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
She told the pot to keep itself safe in Minecraft.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Okay.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Oh, sorry, I'm rubbing my eyes.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
Mommy's tired and trying her best to transform her stream.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
It's gonna be so close.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
I'm, like, warning you all that.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Sorry.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Oh, my eyes are...

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Actually, no.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Sorry.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
What?

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Gosh.

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
Like, these pretty eyes don't come without a downside.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Okay.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Image.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Refling.

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
Uh, Elden Rain.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
What do you guys think about my thumbnail?

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Let's open it.

37:33.000 --> 37:39.000
What do you think?

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
It is pretty good.

37:43.000 --> 37:49.000
Like, there's two good reflings and then one bad invader refling.

37:49.000 --> 37:57.000
And then I have a pot on my head because of that guy that always kills that girl with a pot on his head.

37:57.000 --> 38:03.000
And then, for the next thumbnail, you guys are defending me.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Look, invaders go in first.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
And then the two good reflings are in front of me.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
And then I'm buying just you up in my head, all like...

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
See, you guys are keeping me safe.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
It's great.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
I'm glad you think so.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Wow.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
Let me solo her.

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
Yes, that's the name. Let me solo her.

38:31.000 --> 38:37.000
So, I'm going to hopefully have my heart rate shock collar set up.

38:37.000 --> 38:47.000
So, every time I cause us to lose of height, you guys get to shock me and you get to see when.

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
But I don't know how to set up the when thing.

38:51.000 --> 38:59.000
I don't know if I could collectively get you all to make to the anticipation and whatever reflings is.

38:59.000 --> 39:05.000
You know, shock first, that shock.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Am I leaking again?

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
Leaking what?

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
We can all solo Strony.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
I just get in the lane.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Get that premium pass.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
Then I put it up a PC.

39:23.000 --> 39:27.000
Because I need me to get that Fortnay Baobass.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.000
Falk Niel Lar. Yes, I thought it through.

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
Are you going to set up a group password?

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Of course.

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
I think the password is four layers long.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
So, maybe we'll put like...

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
Fair for green and French.

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
And then Fortnay Baobass.

39:53.000 --> 40:01.000
Do you start immediately for the watch along or for...

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Elden, right?

40:03.000 --> 40:09.000
There's a 15 minute break after this ASMR because I need to swap my microphones around.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
Because I'm using my 3Dio right now.

40:13.000 --> 40:17.000
But I use an SMB7.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
And that's when you can hear...

40:19.000 --> 40:23.000
Well, actually the 3Dio shows you how echoey the room is.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
Oh, I forgot to make a T.

40:27.000 --> 40:33.000
Trat.

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
Did you see Emmy Shulker's self on the watch along?

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
I did not.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
I've kind of said this before.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
The only thing I...

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
Not dislike.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Well, I guess it's dislike.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
I don't have time to watch the streams.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
I have time to watch Mersi.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.000
Because what happens normally after a stream?

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
I'll get a T and record what I need to record.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
And all that.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
And plan what I need to do.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
I've recorded 3 ASMR collabs.

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
So, I'm editing Mamosa's first.

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
Because it's super simple and easy.

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
There's not even like 4 minutes of dialogue.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
But I made the biggest mistake of trying to record during the freaking day.

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
It was like car after car after car.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
But I caught some of Mersi's karaoke.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
And oh my god, I want to do her karaoke.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
You know the guy that goes,

41:35.000 --> 41:41.000
I want to do her karaoke right now.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Because of Mersi.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
She was just so fun.

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
And she was singing the most adorable songs.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
And it was so precious.

41:51.000 --> 41:57.000
So, I'm really excited to...

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
She made some fun noises.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
And I think you will too.

42:01.000 --> 42:05.000
And me and Freak, she probably liked that.

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
But I'm going to see if I can do karaoke next week.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
I can't remember what.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
So next week is the last of June.

42:15.000 --> 42:19.000
And I wanted to wrap up RuneScape.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
And I wanted to finish Elden Ring.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
But the problem is they're both insurances.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
The voice is breaking.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Shit.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
And I was like, I want to go back on Skyrim.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Because I fixed the achievements on Skyrim.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
So we can actually play through the game properly.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
And not get distracted.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
But I'm so unprofessional.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
There's genuinely...

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
I'm not being funny if there's a vampire out there.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Going to me a favor and infect me.

42:51.000 --> 42:57.000
Because if I didn't need to sleep, the content that would be cooked.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
She loved it.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
And after.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
She was really cute.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
I'm glad.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
But yeah, if I didn't need to sleep,

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
I could do all these things all at once.

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
I've got three ASMR collabs I need to edit.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Which I think I can probably do today.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
And then soon.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
And just be like, I'm going to upload it soon dm.

43:23.000 --> 43:29.000
I want to upload my second 2k audio.

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
And then I want to message.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
And then I want to upload mimosa.

43:35.000 --> 43:39.000
And then two more 1000 subscriber thank yous.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
And then the next collab partner.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Which I don't think I've said who it is.

43:43.000 --> 43:49.000
But I made the plots super easy for the girls.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
I didn't want to overwhelm them.

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
I'm so sorry my voice is breaking.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
If you can hear that.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
But I need my throat to recover.

44:01.000 --> 44:07.000
See, next week we're writing some scripts together.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
And you guys are actually going to help me write the missing script for this month.

44:11.000 --> 44:17.000
So you get to tell me what you want to hear.

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
Favourite companion in Skyrim.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Mjöl.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
Mjöl or Serena.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
That's nice, I like Serena.

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
If you were a vampire, I would let you have my blood.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
You'd let me feed on you.

44:35.000 --> 44:45.000
I just don't sleep in the middle of some squid ink spaghetti.

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
So I can make squid slime spaghetti.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
But you guys can make squid ink spaghetti.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
See, I slime and you ink.

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
You jack ink.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
I gel slime.

45:01.000 --> 45:07.000
But yeah, I hope to have more ASMR up today.

45:07.000 --> 45:15.000
I've made myself a little mini promise.

45:15.000 --> 45:21.000
Which is where I will instigate 10 ASMR collabs per month.

45:21.000 --> 45:29.000
Which means if all goes well, I will have completed my goal of 100 feature per collabs.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
Before a year is finished.

45:33.000 --> 45:39.000
So I have 6 collabs instigated with other features.

45:39.000 --> 45:43.000
I'm going to put my big girl pants on and reach out to a few other people.

45:43.000 --> 45:55.000
But I'm limiting it to 10 only.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
I don't want to ask any more than 10.

45:57.000 --> 46:03.000
So I need to finish this current batch before I can ask the 11th person.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
That makes sense.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
That's a lot of collabs.

46:07.000 --> 46:13.000
Ain't no picture here or can't watch that.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
I'm so sorry.

46:15.000 --> 46:19.000
I accidentally just put your cleaner up my nose.

46:19.000 --> 46:31.000
That feel awful.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
I've been sorry.

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
When on the hook, I get really animated.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
I was thrown around the ear clinic.

46:39.000 --> 46:47.000
And it went open.

46:47.000 --> 46:51.000
You're definitely ambitious.

46:51.000 --> 46:59.000
Because I was always weaving it around like a wandering pot.

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
Like a wandering garden.

47:03.000 --> 47:07.000
It was true.

47:29.000 --> 47:35.000
Sorry, I'm crying right now.

47:35.000 --> 47:45.000
I'm laughter.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
I'm crying.

47:47.000 --> 47:53.000
I don't want to release more.

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
I'm sorry.

47:57.000 --> 48:13.000
I'm just supposed to be relaxed.

48:13.000 --> 48:19.000
I'm fucking losing it mate.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
I'm wiping away my tears.

48:21.000 --> 48:29.000
It's not that funny.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
I just need to calm down.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
I'm so sorry.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
I'm high on painkillers.

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
It wasn't that funny.

48:39.000 --> 48:51.000
I'm just sick of it.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
I'm done.

48:53.000 --> 48:59.000
I have so much tears coming out of my eyes.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
I'm wiping away my wee tears.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
I'm sorry.

49:03.000 --> 49:07.000
I forgot.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
I'm sorry.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
I'm sorry.

49:11.000 --> 49:19.000
I'm back to his mind.

49:19.000 --> 49:23.000
I'm sorry.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Are you flaying?

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
You made me cry.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
You made me cry.

49:29.000 --> 49:35.000
I'm embarrassed.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
I should get that turned into a clip.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Why not?

49:39.000 --> 49:45.000
Streamer loses it after sticking at your cleaner up thing.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
I'm okay.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
I'm okay.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
I'm okay.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Breathe in.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Breathe out.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
ASMR.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Shhh.

49:59.000 --> 50:03.000
Relax.

50:03.000 --> 50:07.000
I wish I had this picture that I found yesterday.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
It was really funny.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
I wish I could show you it.

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
But I turned my phone off after TikTok opened itself up.

50:15.000 --> 50:19.000
That other stream.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Okay, sorry.

50:21.000 --> 50:25.000
Relax.

50:25.000 --> 50:31.000
The moon that waits today was a filming yesterday.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Okay, there we go.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Shhh.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Shhh.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Shhh.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Shhh.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Shhh.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Shhh.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Shhh.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
It's like when you did debut

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
and put that you wanted to list

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
and made one too.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Shhh.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
No, seriously.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
How did you manage to get on?

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
I was waving about

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
when I talk

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
I like wave my hands around

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
and like basically

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
I just perfectly leaned

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
to go in.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Shhh.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Shhh.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Okay.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Now excuse me.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Well, now we know where your funny button is.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Oh, this noise.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Actually,

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
it's disgusting.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Humor is far humor.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
There's like this trend

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
where you golf

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
to try and cover up your far.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Your far?

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
But you like purposely golf

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
way before the far.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Before the far.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Then your far.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Shhh.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Shhh.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Shhh.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Shhh.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Shhh.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Sorry.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Shhh.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Shhh.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Shhh.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Shhh.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
I've not been funny.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
And when you guys sent an audio

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
of your farted marshmallow,

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
I think I would absolutely lose it.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Shhh.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Shhh.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Shhh.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Shhh.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Shhh.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
ASMR ASMR.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
My professional ASMR.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
By the way,

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
this is my livelihood.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
It's exactly what we did.

52:35.000 --> 52:51.480
Another brief

52:51.480 --> 53:01.880
It's that request. Stop. If someone does sit and chat, check your washable because I'm

53:01.880 --> 53:08.360
in a very giggly mid right now, it must be the painkillers or what. I'm just on a high

53:08.360 --> 53:17.720
dose, it's not even like anything serious. Alright, a volunteer's tribute. It's like,

53:17.720 --> 53:26.120
so the trend is you like cough to cover up your fart and then your fart, so it's delayed,

53:26.120 --> 53:33.960
so everyone notices your fart. ASMR strongly makes, I should probably change the title of

53:33.960 --> 53:44.360
this stream and just call it ASMR by field violently. Okay, brush your nose with your

53:44.360 --> 53:50.200
ear cleaner. Brush my nose with your ear cleaner. Have you heard about a joke at first?

53:50.200 --> 54:02.600
My favorite one is like, whenever you fart, just say, oh do you smell popcorn? So everyone takes

54:02.600 --> 54:13.640
the big one. So everyone goes, and for some reason Yoda is in my head whenever I say that.

54:14.600 --> 54:22.280
Because there's a shot of Yoda leaning backwards in Star Wars, and it looks like he's taken a big

54:22.280 --> 54:25.640
old sniff.

54:28.440 --> 54:35.480
And this is so, have you seen the one where the dead drops a plate on the floor and they

54:35.560 --> 54:38.760
take like, this is bad. No.

54:41.720 --> 54:43.160
You can't take this.

54:47.800 --> 54:50.360
I can't. I'm so sorry.

54:53.720 --> 54:56.760
No, I haven't seen it.

54:57.080 --> 55:09.240
I'm fucking gone. I can't even handle farting in my head.

55:15.560 --> 55:20.040
I'm so sorry. I'm like crying and spitting everywhere right now.

55:21.000 --> 55:28.440
This is an ASMR. I don't even know why I bothered labeling these days. You know what,

55:28.440 --> 55:32.040
I'm just going to start labeling ASMR streams, not ASMR.

55:40.520 --> 55:46.280
I have so many to you. I've never cried or laughed for so long. Actually, I think this is the first

55:46.360 --> 55:49.640
time I've cried and laughed, and thank you refunds. I really needed this one.

55:52.200 --> 55:56.680
Oh my god. ASMR is more like ASMR fart.

56:00.840 --> 56:07.400
Strawny hypnotizes to peel your finger. I'm so sorry. Okay, whisper, whisper, whisper.

56:10.600 --> 56:14.920
It was just the way that message was typed out. Oh, did you see the one where the guy

56:14.920 --> 56:25.320
smashed a plate in shams? That is so specific. Wipe, smash a plate. I'm going to cough, sorry.

56:30.600 --> 56:36.680
Oh, there's stuff stuck in my throat. That stuff in her throat, literally me.

56:39.320 --> 56:41.000
Sorry, I'm going to need to actually cough.

56:45.320 --> 56:57.880
Oh, gone. Oh, okay. I'm so sorry. Right. Actually, ASMR.

57:01.640 --> 57:04.040
Only one more hour of the giggles to go.

57:04.040 --> 57:14.760
Oh, actually, I'm going to redirect into Sheebie, and then I go offline for 15 minutes,

57:14.760 --> 57:23.640
and then we watch Transformers. It is a membership watch alone, but free access stream though, smile.

57:23.640 --> 57:38.040
We heard it. I heard what? A fortuse. Don't be like this. She tried to cover it with a cough.

57:41.240 --> 57:47.240
I've actually heard my voice from laughing so hard, as well as whispering. So now...

57:54.200 --> 57:56.040
It's okay, good.

58:01.000 --> 58:06.520
Remember the Yoda crying video where he gets slapped, yeah? She beats five hours.

58:08.920 --> 58:20.040
Wait, I can't redirect into anyone, I feel her. Oh my god. My unit is broken in AC's offline.

58:21.000 --> 58:33.880
I can't stream because I need to do, well, I need to do the watch alone, and I need to rest and come for a nap.

58:36.680 --> 58:40.440
You'll have to get to the next one. Well, you got to hear my laughing fit, so...

58:41.320 --> 58:55.720
I downloaded Transformers 2007 with Sam Webwiki, and Megan Fox, and Bumblebee.

58:57.880 --> 59:00.680
Feel her unity over a glittering portrait here.

59:01.400 --> 59:09.560
Will the watch alone have a tape stamp? Oh, I'll raise you one even better than a tape stamp.

59:10.120 --> 59:14.600
It will also be on screen, but blurred, so you know that we're together at the same section.

59:16.280 --> 59:22.200
So please don't worry about not being able to be at the same time as me. You're gonna know if you're at the same time as me.

59:23.160 --> 59:24.200
It's too firm.

59:29.160 --> 59:36.120
I'm cleaning your ear right now with a little sponge, although maybe I should clean it with my dog.

59:43.320 --> 59:47.720
Is that better? I think so. Yeah, that looks better.

59:48.600 --> 59:51.560
Okay, just dry you off a little bit.

59:54.600 --> 59:57.960
Please show the girls how to do that. Okay, yes.

59:57.960 --> 01:00:17.640
I'm going for a nap. I can go to our classic bubbles.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.480
Thank you, Stronny. You're awesome. No, you're awesome. Refling.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:31.480
Wow.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.680
I want to be hypnotized soon, too.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:51.160
I've basically, sorry, my voice is really struggling.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:10.840
I basically am going to achieve, I'm going to focus on RuneScape, and I'm going to focus on Elden Ring.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:17.880
And then in July, I'm doing all my secret side missions, which is like the free audio uploads and all that.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:23.320
Stronny, what's the spray you're using earlier? It's my slime.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:29.800
I made homemade slime and put it in a bowl to spray on YouTube and stream to hear it.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.120
I have to add water so it's extra slimy.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:38.120
But yeah, a little bowl of my slime. Let's go with my pheromones in it.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:53.480
But yes, RuneScape and Elden Ring are my objective, mission objective.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:59.880
I'm so sorry. I'm going to drink, I'm going to take a drink of water.

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.520
Have you fucked with my voice? Wow, it's this fucked.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:10.600
Remember kids, don't do ASMR. Girls, you end up like me.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:14.600
Oh my god, it's something like an old woman from Skyrim.

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:20.760
Talking to an old woman trying to do your good deed for the day?

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:31.640
Yes, or I sound like the thing from Conker's Bad Fur Day at the start or something.

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:54.200
It's Gryllococaine. Oh, that's a Gryllococaine.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:59.000
Old women, old women are female.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:03.000
Here to do your good deed for the day, Sunny.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:11.080
Oh dear, your ears look so cold. What do I call you, sweetheart?

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:17.640
Oh, yes, your ears are too cold. Be out here.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.520
Let me warm them up for you.

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:27.960
See, Sunny, that feels better.

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.840
You should rest your voice.

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:48.040
I should, but I'm going to have a honey tea and then I will watch Transformers.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.000
Call me Riefling, please. Riefling.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:58.760
Okay, have a fluffy make-up part.

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.440
You sound like female Voldemort.

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:08.680
What does Voldemort even say?

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:15.320
Harry! Harry, I can touch you.

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:19.800
It's over for you.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:20.600
Yeah.

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.360
Gentle girlfriend. Oh, she's English, isn't she?

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.720
Who does gentle English is for school?

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:47.160
Hello, I'm English. I'm gentle girlfriend.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:51.720
And I have a naturally soothing voice.

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:57.240
Unfortunately, this is definitely not where she's located in England,

01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.400
so I do apologise if I'm insulting you.

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.720
Would you guys still love me if I was English, to be honest?

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:10.520
And there's actually only one right answer to that question.

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.240
And the answer is no.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.640
You're supposed to say you only love me Scottish.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:26.040
Imagine. Imagine, yeah? If I was English.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:30.440
Landusie.

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:37.240
Echelon. Oh my god, would you get tingles if I gave you ASMR as a child?

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.920
You're not really going to get tingles, are you?

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:42.760
You're such a naughty boy, Riefling.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.040
You're so strange like that, honestly.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.880
Can I get a Chauvin gen 2 of that big group?

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:54.200
Riefling, so what's wrong with you?

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.200
All you do is ink around the place.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:59.320
I'm starting to think you like when I go and I chewed Rieflings.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.480
Could be French, Stedeon.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.920
Bonjour, Rieflings.

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:09.880
Salut, ça va?

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:11.480
Bonne nuit.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.000
Bonne avenue.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:14.440
Bon veilleux.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:16.440
Hello.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.000
Ma préférée, Riefling.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:23.000
ASMR, Struits, en français.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.680
Oh mon Riefling.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:31.640
J'ai besoin de ça.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.520
Ah, thank you, tiny spinny, for the tip.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.280
Ah, enjoy my stream.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.160
This sounds very wrong.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.680
Didn't he ask for German next?

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:49.800
I can't need any German.

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:56.200
Sad to say, I'll be gone for the watch-along at work,

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:59.240
but I'll have to catch up to the watch-along before I'd enjoy it.

01:06:59.240 --> 01:06:59.640
I will.

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:04.440
Your chaos comes so naturally, it's hard to follow,

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:06.520
but so easy to enjoy.

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:09.560
Oh, I'm glad you like my chaos.

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.560
It makes me feel very appreciated.

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:14.600
Here, let me show you my appreciation for you.

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:31.000
French, Ronnie, can you hurt ya?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.760
For some reason, whenever I speak French, my voice goes lighter.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.720
Bonjour, de l'aimant.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:41.320
Salut, je suis Stronica Delce.

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:44.040
Salut, ça va?

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:46.920
Bien, ouais, ouais, bien.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:54.520
I don't know why I go late when I speak French.

01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:01.960
Tu peux soire ASMR?

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:12.680
Pour deux, Monsieur, pour deux, deux minutes, ASMR, deux.

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:18.680
Yeah, I don't know why, it just naturally goes fucking later.

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.720
When I'm all the way down here, I'm a default.

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.440
It's charming.

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:25.480
Well, glad you think so.

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:41.240
Well, I can't, I don't have a German accent.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.800
I don't think I have a Dutch accent.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:46.280
Hallo.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.720
Ich bin Stronica Delce.

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:54.360
No, I don't have a Dutch accent, really.

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:57.560
Ich spelen.

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.280
Ich spelen?

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:12.040
Nee, ich stremen auf YouTube mit ASMR.

01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:15.400
Wie bin ich?

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.400
Ich bin Stronica Delce.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.400
Ich hau von Jau.

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:24.440
Ich hau von Juli.

01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.840
Yeah, I don't have a Dutch accent.

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.480
Sorry, I need more water.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.640
How long did it take you to learn French?

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.640
I actually don't know French.

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:40.680
It's just, I repeat words and throw sentences together, but I actually don't know.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:42.840
American Stronica would be hilarious.

01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:53.880
Well, yes, you might just get ash from Overwatch, because it's ash here.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:04.280
Is there a chance that videos that get taken down be uploaded to Patreon?

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:07.080
Timothy Shaw, thank you for the tip.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.600
I can upload videos, but I can upload audios.

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:13.880
I'm using my current Patreon as an audio sound bank.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:17.960
I upload the stuff I put on YouTube up on it as well.

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:23.960
I actually, so I, you know what?

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.000
I can make you a deal.

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:31.800
Do you want to know how good I am at dancing the rules of YouTube?

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.120
Not one stream or one video on my YouTube channel is limited ads.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:43.880
You have to admit, this cut off fish is bloody cunning.

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.720
Can you speak with a lisp for Dutch?

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.600
Have to speak with a lisp for Dutch.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:57.480
For native ones.

01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:59.000
Dutch mincing?

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.480
How about Canadian accent?

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:06.280
I am going to be so stereotypical when I say this.

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:13.000
I do not hear much of a difference between Americans and Canadians.

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:14.920
I'm so sorry.

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:17.880
I can't hear an accent differentiation.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.040
Yeah, I know.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:22.840
Put me in the bin.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:23.880
Spanish?

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:28.440
I have no experience with Spanish, unfortunately.

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.640
I know sombre voicelines.

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.280
Augusta, my pantyhorn.

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:40.280
Merda.

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:46.360
How about a Kiwi accent?

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:50.360
Real, it's the same.

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.640
Shit, I'm so sorry.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:56.200
Just don't tell me it's the same.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.040
There really isn't a certain word.

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.480
It sounds like Kiwi accent.

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:04.600
I used to be able to do an Australian news anchor.

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.840
And here we are reporting.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:11.160
No, well my voice is too fried for it.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.840
But Kiwi accent is too hard.

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.760
The only Kiwi I can do is a Coca-Cola glass.

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:19.480
A Pepsi bottle.

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:21.800
I don't give a Dean.

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:25.080
It's the only Kiwi I can do.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:31.560
Lol, I actually think that Canadians just sound like Midwesterners

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.080
with a slight French twinge.

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:35.800
Like, I know it's controversial,

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:39.800
but it kind of just feels like the same side of a coin.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:43.400
And everyone's been like, no, that side's head and that side tails.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.520
Like, as an outsider, like as a European.

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:51.480
Um, with like, obviously,

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.640
with European's geography, everyone is so close by,

01:12:55.640 --> 01:13:00.040
like Belgium, Netherlands, France, Germany, Poland, right over there.

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:02.680
Like, those are accent differentiations.

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:07.000
If you think of how massive the land mass of America and Canada is,

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:11.880
and you're telling me that that's such an immense difference,

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:17.800
I'm sorry, but call me 20 because I didn't hear it.

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:27.320
Wonder if Dutch English accent sounds cute to Anglophones' Dutch accent sounds

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:30.440
to Northern Germans, because we find them adorable.

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:38.280
Okay guys, I'm gonna just start seeing random Dutch stuff

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.200
I can remember off the top of my head.

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:44.040
Tell me if you think it's cute or not, so we can answer this guy's question.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:50.920
Hello, how are you? I'm Strony Cattles.

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:59.960
I live in Australia, I have hunger.

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:06.680
I don't have a Dutch family.

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:11.880
To be honest, I teach Dutch on the Xbox.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:16.840
There's one reason why I don't have it so much,

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:23.000
because I've been friends with Freemasonians,

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.800
but I have no friends anymore.

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:33.000
That's the best German for you.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:40.600
I don't speak English, so I eat stropwafel, where my...

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.440
Big Vast!

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:45.640
You just throw random English words at the end of them.

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:51.640
Anything you say is cute, but you're just trying to get me a bullet, aren't you?

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:54.920
I give up, I give up.

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.920
You're cute, no matter what.

01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.920
I'm not smart, but...

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:04.600
Ikal van jou!

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:08.040
I just said, I'm not very smart, but I love you!

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:13.640
Ik ben nietslim mar ikal van jou!

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:17.960
To say I love you in Dutch, you say...

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:20.200
Ikal van jou!

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:25.240
And to say I love you all in Dutch, like if I was talking to all the reflinks, you say...

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:28.440
Ikal van jullie!

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:33.240
And then in German, ich liebe dich.

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:34.600
Wah!

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:40.120
Did I just say something? I think I just said, ich liebe Schwanze.

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.080
Oops.

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:44.120
To say I love you in French, you say...

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:48.760
Je t'aime, je t'aime ma chérie!

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:52.440
And to say I love you in Scotland, you say...

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:53.960
What do you say?

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:57.800
I would probably be derogatory.

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.320
Okay, oops.

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.360
I said it wrong.

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:01.560
You just need to say this.

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:02.760
Ich liebe dich.

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:07.800
And then to say I love you in Spanish, te amo.

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:09.880
Te amo mi amor!

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:12.120
Te amo mi amor!

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:14.120
Y mi amores!

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:26.120
In Polish, I don't know how to say it in Polish.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:28.440
Te amo.

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.280
Oh, Italian's Te amo.

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:34.680
Upsiens Te amo!

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:36.760
Nope, you didn't read it after.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.600
Girl knows how to speak German.

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:41.560
Nein, is das Gras rot?

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:45.080
Nein, das Gras ist klein!

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:47.160
That's the only German I know.

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:49.560
And also you just call the person a Sicker.

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:54.120
Yeah, basically.

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:54.920
You pronounce it...

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:58.040
Desh, desh, ish, liebe desh.

01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:01.240
Yay, thanks for the Spanish.

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.480
And Turkish, in Turkish...

01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:06.840
Sem, ni, seviyorum.

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:12.920
Sem ni seviyorum, sem, sem ni seviyorum.

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:14.440
A cut-fish of many talents.

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:18.280
No, no, see, it's just called learning one sentence and calling it.

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:19.240
Force comp.

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:21.640
Strongly.

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:25.560
Bro, you're killing me with that Spanish.

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.600
What's that?

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.040
Spanish is Te amo.

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:28.840
You had it right.

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:29.640
Italian is just really...

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.400
Is there any other ones that we haven't said?

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:39.160
How to say, I love you in Polish.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:45.000
I love you in Polish.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.520
Wie bin ich?

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:48.360
Ich bin ein Gott.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:50.920
Oh, Kohamshi, in Polish it's Kohamshi.

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:53.000
Kohamshi, who else?

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.880
Wait, actually, let me look at location statistics.

01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:00.200
Analytics, audience, location.

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.680
Let's see, my most...

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.560
The Philippines, oh, hi, Philippines.

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.200
How to say, I love you in Filipino.

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:14.840
Is mahal kita.

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:18.120
Did I do it right?

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:20.280
Mahal kita.

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.800
And where's P in this list?

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:28.520
P for P in...

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.120
Wait, is Filipino not a language?

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:32.520
Filipino?

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:34.120
What?

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:41.160
Philippines, they would speak Filipino in the Philippines.

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:41.560
Am I being...

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:43.960
It's not in Google Translate list.

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:48.360
Latibia.

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.640
Am I being crazy?

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:56.520
Filipinos have appeared.

01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:00.440
Oh wait, no, you guys don't speak Filipino, you speak Tagalog.

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:02.760
Hold on, Tagalog.

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:08.680
Wait, Tagalog isn't on Google Translate?

01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:09.400
What?

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:16.440
Tagalog isn't on Google Translate?

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:21.480
I love you.

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:27.400
Oh, Filipino's spelt with an F in English,

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.840
but the country is spelt with a P,

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:31.880
so I was looking in the wrong places.

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:37.160
Mahal kita.

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:41.160
Well, I didn't use Google Translate to get that to say that, right?

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.400
Okay, mahal kita, and then Germany,

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:45.560
which is Ishtabedi, which is Canadian,

01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:48.120
which is just...

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.400
I love you, could you guys speak it?

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:52.760
Australia, again, I love you, you see.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:54.520
Brazil.

01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:56.280
Oh my God, come to Brazil.

01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:57.960
Why is Brazil watching me?

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.080
I'm not that interesting.

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:00.760
Brazil speak Portuguese.

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:03.480
Eu te amo.

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.400
Eu te amo.

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.000
Eu te amo.

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:07.720
Brazil.

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.280
What are your ancestors and say in Gaelic?

01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:16.120
I love you in Gaelic.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:23.720
Curious.

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:25.880
I love you.

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:29.080
Okay, I don't have to say on that end.

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:32.440
There's no freaking read.

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.040
There's no read.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:43.560
There's no Google read for Irish translation.

01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:47.880
It says Irish instead of Gaelic as well,

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:48.760
which is curious.

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:53.160
You need to catch up with the lore about Scotland

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:55.480
and Gaelic in Ireland at the same time, right?

01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.160
Brainwash me.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.480
Oh yeah, the country is Ph for everything else's F.

01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:02.920
Literally, I just got trolled so hard.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:04.840
Cute Portuguese, Ronnie.

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:08.600
Placota Le Bey?

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:14.280
I think Placota Le Bey means hello in Portuguese.

01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:19.640
Even Google can't pronounce Gaelic.

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.800
Literally, I typed in Gaelic and it goes Irish

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:23.640
and then it doesn't even a nun see anything.

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:26.280
Chong, baby.

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:28.200
Who else?

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:29.480
What other countries watch?

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:31.080
Sweden.

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:31.800
Sweden.

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:34.440
Who the fuck is watching from Sweden right now?

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.440
Oh my god.

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.520
What's the meaning of this?

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:44.280
To say Javla, fita ora.

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:47.080
And Sweden is for Sweden.

01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:50.600
I said, oh wait, there's a Scottish Gaelic.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.840
And again, it doesn't do it.

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:58.040
Anyway, Sweden is where it is.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:01.800
Yeah, I love you.

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.320
I love you.

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:05.640
I love you.

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.040
I love you.

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.480
I love you.

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:13.320
Scottish Gaelic is there.

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:15.800
Yes, but it doesn't say it out loud, so I can't mimic.

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.880
Then it goes Poland, which is Khoamshu.

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:21.240
And then it's France, which is Vietnam.

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:24.680
And then it's the Netherlands, which is the Carvagnol.

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:27.640
And then it's Spain, which is Te Amo.

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:29.800
And then there's just Finland.

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:33.880
Let's try Finland, but a cheeky finish.

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:38.280
F is for finish, let's do stuff together.

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:42.840
U is for unbelievably good unity.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.880
What? Finland, F.

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:48.680
A, B, C, D, E.

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:52.680
A, B, C, D, E, F.

01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:53.800
Oh, it was right under.

01:22:59.160 --> 01:22:59.800
Excuse me.

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:01.640
I love you.

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:07.560
I love you for the one finish.

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:10.440
Irish is Bruno's Gaelic, but it's called his Gaelic.

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.280
You're getting your card revolt right now.

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:14.920
No, I was always Gaelic in school.

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.200
Short on behaviour.

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:23.000
Actually, I'm Irish then, and I find that offensive.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.640
Wait, I just went Aussie by accident.

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:27.800
I can't even do an Aussie accent naturally.

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:35.160
Bro, sorry, it's Gaelic, sorry, Gaelic.

01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:45.080
Also, I broke the bad news to Sin that we have to do her collab in July.

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:49.080
Where the heck is Russian?

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:53.480
I love you.

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:00.200
That's so fast.

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:00.680
Holy shit.

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:03.880
Can you give me like a second in between those two other sentences?

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:06.120
Okay, hold on.

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:09.320
We're going to put a comma in between love and you because it goes so fast.

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:12.120
Okay, you didn't change a thing.

01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:16.200
Now your card is revoked.

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:18.680
I always knew you were a fake Scottish.

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:21.720
Sin, you can't expose me like this.

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:23.160
I'll jam a toothpick up your nose.

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:25.400
Oh wait, not a toothpick.

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:26.600
I actually don't, you missed it.

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:32.360
I accidentally jammed my freaking Japanese ear cleaner up my nose by accident

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:35.240
because I was swishing it about like a wand and then ended up having a

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:38.040
fucking laugh in my ass off over it.

01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:40.120
Like it's tickling your ear.

01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:43.320
You have to be Olympia.

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:46.440
I'm tall but I could do it.

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:47.640
Would you still let me far as Irish?

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:50.520
Here, father, who aren't in heaven?

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:51.480
How do I debate that name?

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:52.760
Someone says Icelandic.

01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:58.360
Icelandic.

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.960
All right, there's nothing called Icelandic.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.480
Are you trolling me right now?

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:04.760
I have been successfully trolling.

01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.200
A longer wait for two Sculpe Grammels a year or so?

01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:08.600
I don't know.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.800
I love in Scottish pronunciation.

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:19.960
Oh my god, also go RuneScape mention.

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:26.600
Can you say kom in what's Cantonese?

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.600
Wait, Cantonese isn't listed.

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:43.320
It says Chinese simplified but is that just a massive oversight?

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.960
Yeah, it just doesn't have Cantonese.

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:49.960
Wow, the best you're getting is Chinese simplified from me.

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:02.120
How do you say it in Kotfisch?

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:04.680
Blah blah blah blah blah blah.

01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:05.880
Wait, blah blah blah blah.

01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:07.960
How fast can I do that?

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:09.640
Blah blah blah blah blah blah.

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:16.360
Now imagine that on the brineulum.

01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:17.480
Thank you, I'll be here all week.

01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:20.360
Please like and subscribe if you enjoyed this stream, which is not ASMR.

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.840
I'm going to start putting not ASMR at the start of ASMR streams.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:26.200
Yeah, I think it would probably just be bubbles because we're under the water.

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:28.520
I love you.

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:32.520
my shoulder is just cracked

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:35.520
sorry I forgot to start whispering again

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:38.520
why me?

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:40.520
but yeah

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:45.520

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:52.520
you listen with your nose

01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:53.520
it was a mistake

01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:56.520
I will know

01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:59.520
I will be the ravelling that teaches a Scottish streamer

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:00.520
I speak gaelic

01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:01.520
sorry

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:02.520

we're gaelic over here

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:06.520
since sense about to rip my hair off

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:09.520
oh the bing-chin-ing me

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:10.520
bing-chin-ing

01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:11.520
tang-jo-ma

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:13.520
a bing-chin-ing

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:15.520
the wang

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.520
you don't know the names of your bars

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:20.520
I'll teach ya

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:23.520
so you know that's super sensitive

01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:24.520
but

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:26.520
it feels almost too good to be true

01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:34.520
almost that 8k

01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:35.520
oh please let it

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:37.520
actually I'm gonna

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.520
I have an edit video I can upload

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:42.520
now this one will get limited ads

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:44.520
but it's well deserved

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.520
have you been here?

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:53.520
sorry it means I love you too

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:55.520
and finish like

01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:59.520
it's gonna be me

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:01.520
I'm uploading an ASMR video

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:03.520
and it's called

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.520
ASMR collabing

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:07.520
with new hands

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:09.520
it's gonna be quite an experience

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:11.520
when you click on it

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:13.520
that's all I'm gonna say

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.520
because my other video isn't limited

01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:18.520
like there's literally not one video that's limited

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:20.520
ads on my channel so I'm not sweating

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:23.520
you mentioned earlier that you don't mean

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:25.520
bend it forward do you?

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.520
no he's like bending backwards

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.520
to like take a big sniff

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:33.520
guys when they learn what the

01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:35.520
the pendulum is

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.520
like if you don't know what a pendulum is

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:39.520
don't worry

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:41.520
I'll teach ya the premium pass

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:42.520
for the meeting

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:43.520
okay

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:45.520
and he's stop

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:46.520
that's terrible

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:49.520
someone say me

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:50.520
a marshmallow

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.520
actually I should check out marshmallow

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:53.520
someone sent me a marshmallow

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:54.520
and they were like

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:55.520
if I was ever in front of you

01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:57.520
I don't even think I could make eye contact

01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:58.520
and I'm like mate

01:28:58.520 --> 01:28:59.520
I'm so small

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:00.520
I'm literally like

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.520
fall in love

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.520
five two

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.520
you do not have to be intimidated by me

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.520
I'm not gonna do anything to you

01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:10.520
oh

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:19.520
holy crap your whispering voice is so

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.520
oh yeah

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:24.520
you like it when you can hear my accent

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:27.520
you're so sweet to me

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:29.520
refling you really are

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:31.520
I wonder what triggers

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:33.520
your neurons while listening

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:37.520
that sound a bit more dominant

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:39.520
when I give a heavy whisper

01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:41.520
is that

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:44.520
you're just such a subby little refling

01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:46.520
you can't help

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:48.520
but mail

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.520
when I'm right up close and personal

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.520
in your ears huh

01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:55.520
I like when you're submissive

01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:58.520
it's cute

01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:00.520
you're cute

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:05.520
I wouldn't be intimidated by you

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:08.520
I'd be intimidated by my own anxiety

01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.520
let me hold it was an experience

01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:15.520
well

01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:16.520
wait until the next day

01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:18.520
some more experience

01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.520
eye contact

01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:21.520
would you be brave enough

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.520
to look into my eyes

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.520
how are you

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:34.520
oh no my internet is losing the fight again

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:39.520
5-2 can't make eye contact

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:40.520
if you're that low

01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:41.520
literally I'm like pretty sure

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:43.520
like almost always at all to me

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:44.520
although it would be really nice

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:47.520
if a few of you were smaller than me

01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:50.520
then I could just absolutely annihilate you

01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:56.520
and you'd be so kind to me

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:58.520
and I'd be so nice to you

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.520
kiss my ear canal

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:01.520
no

01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:09.520
a melon for your fruit

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:15.520
I haven't ever wrote before stream

01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:17.520
I had an old secret audio in bed

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:19.520
but it went everywhere

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:22.520
and I thought you'd know how

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:27.520
I haven't even done the main break stuff yet

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:29.520
I

01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:35.520
wait what

01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:37.520
I keep forgetting to record the audio

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:39.520
year's day 3 of 7

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:41.520
it's a little embarrassing at first

01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:43.520
but now it feels natural

01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:47.520
stroney the allegations stroney

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:52.520
and he sent me to fail

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:53.520
oops

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:55.520
I definitely can't be opening that

01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:57.520
stroney ear breathing is just like

01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:03.520
they like feeling my breath

01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:06.520
against your ear

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:12.520
you've always been nice though

01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:14.520
so I don't think you've ever not been nice

01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:17.520
but how do you be mean

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:18.520
I don't know how you be mean

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.520

01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:43.520

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.520
I apologize if I said this to you

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:47.520
ah don't worry

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.520

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:53.520
for four years now

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:55.520
wah veteran

01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:57.520
watching VTubers big and small

01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:59.520
successful and just starting

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:00.520
I've laughed

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:01.520
I've loved

01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:02.520
I've cheered and I've cried

01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.520
I thought I'd seen everything

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:06.520
the VTubers space have to offer

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:07.520
but the past two weeks have

01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:08.520
driven me wrong

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:10.520
wait wow

01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:12.520
I don't know what it is

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:13.520
or how it happened

01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:15.520
or what the difference is

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:16.520
but

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:17.520
oops sorry

01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:18.520
but I know this

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:20.520
even though I just met you

01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:22.520
I would follow you into the dicks of

01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:23.520
hell

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:25.520
your natural leadership

01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:27.520
and magnetic personality has

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:29.520
built me and trapped me against you

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:31.520
and I wouldn't have it any other way

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:33.520
as also

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:35.520

01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:42.520
I've had to follow you

01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:44.520
and all the feeler girls

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:46.520
for as long as this rate lasts

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:49.520
you can't meet me kamioshi

01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:52.520
you can't do that

01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:56.520

01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:04.520
that's insane

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:07.520
are you telling me all it took

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:12.520
was someone who can weaponize their ups

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:17.520
typical kamioshi

01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:20.520
you're telling me you've never came across

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:22.520
someone with a perfect mix

01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:24.520
of ADHD and autism your honor

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:28.520

01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:34.520

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:39.520
and my tentacles already have a grasp on ya

01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:43.520
and you can't get home

01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:46.520
now that you'd want to

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:49.520
not until

01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.520
I'm fully done

01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:55.520
mind breaking ya

01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:04.520
I'm glad you enjoy all the feeler girls so much

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:06.520
though that's so nice

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:09.520
stroney is real and cannot be stopped

01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:10.520
and will conquer the world

01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:12.520
oh my god someone left a comment

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:14.520
on my RuneScape stream when I was doing my dinner

01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:15.520
foil stuff

01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:19.520
and they were like logistics actually cost a lot of money

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:23.520
and I'm like who do you think sets the fucking prices you eat ya

01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:24.520
ah

01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:25.520
I just deleted it

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:27.520
I was like no and you're not getting

01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:29.520
you're not getting picture

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:31.520
you will accept my tinfoil

01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:35.520
my tinfoil rents or you will accept none of me at all

01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:40.520
the bill don't be

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:42.520
strun

01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:43.520
strunrism

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:44.520
strunism is real

01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:46.520
yes it is real

01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:51.520
I just want to say I'm deeply envious

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:53.520
and in all of your productivity

01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:54.520
the discipline and fuck it

01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:57.520
the discipline

01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:03.520
I have no discipline

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:05.520
and I have no focus

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:08.520
what I have

01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:10.520
is weaponised autism

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:13.520
and I will scream that from the rooftops

01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:18.520
I spawned in and rolled two pairs of dice

01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:23.520
and they miraculously landed a 6x

01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:24.520
ok

01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:29.520
and those 6x equated to me being creative via ASMR

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:33.520
and collabing and organising and productivity in that sense

01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:35.520
in real life jobs

01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:37.520
I am not as good like this

01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:39.520
although I really enjoyed my cafe job

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:42.520
so I may have been a cafe owner in another life

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:47.520
so please do not ever feel bad

01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:49.520
ever feel guilty

01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:52.520
ever feel anything negative

01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:55.520
about not being productive in this day and age

01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:57.520
I will put my tinfoil hat around right now

01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:01.520
humans are not meant to be focused on the task

01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:02.520
for more than 8 hours at a time

01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:03.520
that is not possible

01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:05.520
that is not the way we have been raised

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:08.520
we have been thrown into this new day and age

01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:10.520
where nothing is adequate

01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:12.520
why do you think there is currently a battle

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:15.520
about a 4 day work week

01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:19.520
why do you think all these issues in society stem from

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:22.520
is it because mayhaps we are not designed

01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:25.520
for what we are using our bodies and minds for

01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:26.520
in this day and age

01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:27.520
I don't know

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:29.520
anyway put the tinfoil hat away

01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:30.520
put it away

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:32.520
we can come back to that conversation later

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:34.520
oh you said another sentence

01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:35.520
sorry I didn't read it

01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:38.520
also I want to fold you like origami or something

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:42.520
of course I missed that sentence and read it

01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:47.520
ignore this

01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:48.520
if it's already been dealt with

01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:50.520
just wondering if the stream times are correct

01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:52.520
no they are not

01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:53.520
I have changed though

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:56.520
I will update the rest of my week on YouTube very shortly

01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:00.520
yeah but yesterday the luck wasn't on our side

01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:05.520
the box shot really made me feel conscious of your unluckiness

01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:08.520
I use all my luck up on my daughters

01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:09.520
and my reeflings

01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:11.520
I now have both

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:13.520
I want nothing more

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:15.520
I ask for nothing more

01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:17.520
other than you know the success of my daughters

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:18.520
but that's it

01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:24.520
I heard humans can only work efficiently

01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:27.520
for 45 minutes and the brain loses and projectivates

01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:30.520
hello scrawny

01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:33.520
I'm just a thought and a clip watcher for the girls

01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:35.520
hi I thought watchers

01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:36.520
thank you for watching us

01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:38.520
we appreciate you

01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:44.520
I can't read out what you said

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:46.520
thought watcher

01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:49.520
but I have said something

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:51.520
so please don't worry

01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:55.520
and please don't worry about being a silent viewer as well

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:57.520
you can be as loud or as quiet as you like

01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:59.520
shout out to lurkers and everything

01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:01.520
please don't ever feel forced to talk

01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:03.520
it is not how it works

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:07.520
hi I just wanted to say you're doing an amazing job

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:09.520
and keep up what you're doing

01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:11.520
wish you're doing an amazing job of thinking to me

01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:13.520
so keep up what you're doing

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:19.520
not to be read on stream

01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:20.520
stream

01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:25.520
I'm reading in my head

01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:43.520
love you to a little riefling

01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:45.520
enjoy your holiday

01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:47.520
oh no you're off on holiday

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:49.520
you're just going off on holiday

01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:53.520
lurkers mentioned yes

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:55.520
you can lurk and be as quiet as you like

01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:57.520
or you can be as active as you like

01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:58.520
I don't like

01:39:58.520 --> 01:39:59.520
hi momen

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:00.520
hi riefling

01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:02.520
I noticed the scrawny tingle

01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:04.520
what was a little hard to make up

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:05.520
in the youtube resolution

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:06.520
oh no

01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:09.520
I made it the same way

01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:16.520
maybe I can revise it and give it a shot

01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:20.520
ehhh

01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:24.520
pardon me

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:26.520
okay I'm gonna take a hydration check

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:28.520
everyone please hydrate

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:34.520
man of four hour work week

01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:35.520
working numbers

01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:36.520
bra honestly

01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:37.520
everyone's like

01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:38.520
I used to work

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:39.520
I used to work

01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:40.520
eight hours a week

01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:43.520
my guy that's called you're being exploited

01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:45.520
you're being exploited

01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:47.520
don't feel

01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:49.520
don't feel proud of working eight hours

01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:51.520
you're being exploited

01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:57.520
get out of your head

01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:59.520
no let me in deeper

01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:01.520
let me in your head

01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:03.520
let my accent consume you

01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:04.520
let my mannerisms consume you

01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:06.520
let my personality

01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:08.520
become you

01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:13.520
okay

01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:14.520
hello

01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:16.520
hi scrawny hi riefling

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:17.520
I hope you're doing well

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:18.520
I'm doing fantastic

01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:19.520
I have the laughing fit

01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:21.520
and I'm high on being killers

01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:23.520
I was wondering if you had any advice

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:25.520
on interacting properly

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:28.520
with content creators

01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:31.520
I never know if I'm doing enough to support

01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:33.520
or too much to support

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:36.520
or if I'm being parasocial or worse

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:38.520
I have no idea what a tribute is

01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:42.520
and I always worry

01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:44.520
I'm using the term oh she wrong

01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:45.520
please don't write

01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:47.520
I reply to tweets too often

01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:48.520
probably

01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:50.520
I'm probably just being anxious about nothing

01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:54.520
I will tell you a very big advice right now

01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:58.520
the only person

01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:01.520
that judges you as harshly as you

01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:03.520
is no one

01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:05.520
they do not exist

01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:07.520
you look at yourself

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:10.520
via a magnifying glass

01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:12.520
you overthink

01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:13.520
on things

01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:15.520
that no one will ever think about

01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:16.520
okay

01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:22.520
so if you

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:24.520
what my wampam advice is

01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:28.520
you are welcome to talk in my stream at any time

01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:32.520
if you worry about

01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:35.520
talking too much or too little

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:37.520
don't worry

01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:39.520
we have the autism

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.520
me and the reflins okay

01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:43.520
we all have issues okay

01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:46.520
so please don't worry about socializing with us

01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:48.520
as for in general

01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:52.520
if you genuinely want a strategic

01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:54.520
structured flow

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:56.520
I would say send a message

01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:59.520
every 5 minutes

01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:01.520
if the chat is slow

01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:03.520
every 3 minutes

01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:05.520
if the chat is fast

01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:08.520
and try to relay your messages

01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:10.520
to something related to the streamer

01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:12.520
this applies to other streamers

01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:13.520
me

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:14.520
you can

01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:16.520
if we're doing an ASMR stream

01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:18.520
you can literally say please say the sentence

01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:20.520
and it's the most diabolical thing

01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:21.520
written to man

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:23.520
that is socially acceptable

01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:24.520
in my streams

01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:26.520
when it comes to other streamers

01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:28.520
try your best to stay on topic

01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:29.520
so for example

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:31.520
if emi is playing the game

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:33.520
the coffin of andi and lele

01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:35.520
you type

01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:36.520
I'm so glad

01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:38.520
I'm emi's brother

01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:39.520
smile

01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:41.520
that's acceptable

01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:43.520
it's related to the game

01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:45.520
it's related to emi's lore

01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:47.520
perfectly fine

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:49.520
no problems

01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:52.520
now you've said I'm worried about being parasocial

01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:54.520
I always say the statement

01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:57.520
you are welcome to be as close

01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:00.520
or as far away as you like

01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:03.520
as long as you are safe

01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:07.520
and you're not showing up to people's houses

01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:09.520
I think it's fine

01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:12.520
but there's a lot behind this

01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:14.520
you know parasocialism

01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:16.520
but as long as you're safe

01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:19.520
and you're not doing emotional damage

01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:21.520
to yourself or others

01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:22.520
all good to go

01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:24.520
em a bit but

01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:27.520
is something you might not know about

01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:30.520
because it is related to alternative streamers

01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:33.520
a bit but is when a wreathling

01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:36.520
may have thoroughly enjoyed an audio

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:38.520
or myself in general

01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:40.520
or a teasing

01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:43.520
and they would like to prove to me

01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:45.520
that they enjoyed it by sending

01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:47.520
an audio

01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:49.520
or a video of evidence

01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:51.520
of enjoying it

01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:54.520
which we have connamed inking

01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:56.520
now for me

01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:58.520
I am comfortable with it

01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:01.520
because I like corrupting

01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:09.520
and I'm fine with it

01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:10.520
but you can always put it in

01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:12.520
you can just drop it in my marshmallow

01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:15.520
I have got a little folder going

01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:17.520
I've got an audio folder

01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:19.520
and a video folder

01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:24.520
you are worried about using oshi

01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:27.520
so oshi means

01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:30.520
well actually the wreathlings

01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:32.520
might be able to describe this better than I ever can

01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:34.520
can oshi mean someone

01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:36.520
that you enjoy watching

01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:38.520
and you are there

01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:40.520
like they're your best streamer

01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:42.520
in a roster

01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:44.520
like if you had to do a 1v1 lineup

01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:46.520
they kept coming out on top

01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:48.520
yeah

01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:52.520
you're worried about your reply to tweets too often

01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:55.520
and you're worried about being anxious over nothing

01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:57.520
I think you might be a little in your own head

01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:59.520
which is okay

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:01.520
everyone is

01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:03.520
don't think you're the only person to ever have these issues

01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:05.520
to ever come to the man

01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:07.520
to ever do this to ever do that

01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:13.520
if you're worried about replying to tweets too often

01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:15.520
my question for you

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:19.520
do you reply to every single tweet?

01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:21.520
I think liking a tweet

01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:23.520
every single tweet

01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:25.520
perfectly fine

01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:27.520
replying to every tweet

01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:31.520
if it is causing you emotional distress

01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:33.520
with the anxiety

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:35.520
then I think

01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:38.520
reply every 3 tweets

01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:41.520
is more than socially acceptable

01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:45.520
or on tweets that you feel ever so inclined to reply on

01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:47.520
so for example

01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:49.520
if your oshi posts

01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:51.520
her weekly schedule

01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:53.520
I think it's more than acceptable to say

01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:55.520
I'm really looking forward

01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:57.520
to this stream on this day

01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:59.520
okay

01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:03.520
oh here we go

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:05.520
refling comes in

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:07.520
oshi is used for idols and celebrities

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:09.520
who you like it means

01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:11.520
I like and support

01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:13.520
I would oshi originates from the kanji

01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:15.520
recommendation

01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:17.520
okay

01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:19.520
yes

01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:21.520
so please just remember

01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:23.520
your head the most

01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:25.520
eh

01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:27.520
and

01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:29.520
yes

01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:35.520
someone says you said before you're not into the idea of being

01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:37.520
okay I don't think I could say that in this stream

01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:39.520
we'll say it in transformers

01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:41.520
okay

01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:45.520
stream warning please don't say this out loud

01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:49.520
what happens if I do say it out loud huh

01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:51.520
are you gonna bust

01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:55.520
stroney I'm glad you're Scottish

01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:59.520
because when you say ours is making me want to disable your abilities

01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:01.520
that's bloody creative

01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:03.520
I'll give you that

01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:05.520
that's creative

01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:13.520
wait she's actually dropping stream of urges right

01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:17.520
I don't want anyone ever feeling like their

01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:19.520
you know

01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:21.520
and the

01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:23.520
doing their thing

01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:25.520
like I just want you to enjoy yourself

01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:27.520
and if you're overthinking it

01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:29.520
then we're gonna tackle that together

01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:33.520
hi stroney I love your laugh

01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:35.520
also your voice is my new favorite ASMR trigger

01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:37.520
oh yeah you like my croaky voice

01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:39.520
you like grailock the kind from Skyrim

01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:41.520
I bet that refling found that very helpful

01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:43.520
oh I hope so

01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:45.520
just being curious

01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:47.520
is acceptable if someone comments on every tweet

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:49.520
or is that wrong

01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:51.520
I think it's perfectly fine

01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:53.520
but I don't tweet all the time

01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:55.520
so yeah

01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:57.520
if you maybe watch a streamer

01:48:57.520 --> 01:48:59.520
that is addicted to tweeting

01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:01.520
I don't know

01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:03.520
I don't know what their comfort levels would be

01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:05.520
I don't, it does not bother me none

01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:07.520
I am rubbish on Twitter

01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:09.520
please don't ever feel bad

01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:11.520
if I don't like give you a like on Twitter or something

01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:13.520
and my tags aren't working

01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:15.520
I can never see my freaking tags

01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:41.520
interesting interesting

01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:49.520
wait someone sent me a poem

01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:51.520
what the heck you guys are so good at poems

01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:55.520
everything you do

01:50:55.520 --> 01:50:57.520
it sends me higher than the moon

01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:59.520
with every twinkle in your eye

01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:01.520
you strike a match

01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:03.520
that lights my heart on fire

01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:05.520
when you're near

01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:07.520
I hate my blushing face

01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:09.520
and trip on my shoelaces

01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:11.520
grace just isn't my forte

01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:13.520
but it brings me to my knees

01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:15.520
when you say hello

01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:17.520
how are you my darling

01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:19.520
today I fall into

01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:21.520
a pail on the floor

01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:23.520
but we love is hard to ignore

01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:25.520
when every little thing you do

01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:27.520
I do adore oh my god that's so great

01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:29.520
what the heck you guys

01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:31.520
didn't tell me you studied Shakespeare

01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:33.520
someone says just reply

01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:35.520
when you can add something

01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:37.520
oh that's so cute

01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:41.520
I think your meme tag

01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:43.520
is spelled incorrectly

01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:45.520
no no no no no

01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:47.520
so originally it was going to be

01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:49.520
cephalobok

01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:51.520
but then I spelled it wrong

01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:53.520
with cephalobok

01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:55.520
and then I realized

01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:57.520
that's exactly on par for me

01:51:57.520 --> 01:51:59.520
so I leave it as cephalobok

01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:03.520
I've been watching Vtuber since

01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:05.520
2018

01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:07.520
and you're the only person I've been willing to get

01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:09.520
up at 3am

01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:11.520
bro I thought I was bad

01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:13.520
waking up at 4am

01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:15.520
bruh

01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:17.520
sorry Ozzy

01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:19.520
I apologize

01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:21.520
I'm 5'3

01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:23.520
but I'm willing to list the kneecaps

01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:25.520
for you I'm not gonna lie

01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:27.520
nah you're perfect

01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:29.520
for sitting on

01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:31.520
because I can get you to lie down

01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:33.520
on the floor

01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:37.520
and

01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:39.520
and if you're 5'3

01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:41.520
that means I'm at crochet

01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:49.520
okay I had to tint my tentacle a few times

01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:51.520
during this

01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:53.520
multiple

01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:55.520
refractionary

01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:57.520
itching

01:52:57.520 --> 01:52:59.520
why?

01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:03.520
I strongly as a scout listening

01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:05.520
to you put that English accent on

01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:07.520
I heard you're so

01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:09.520
what's wrong with having a chat yet

01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:11.520
who do you mean an overwatch

01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:13.520
I don't play overwatch anymore

01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:15.520
I'm so sorry

01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:17.520
I'm sorry a little too briefly

01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:19.520
I used to play Saria

01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:21.520
strong as a mountain

01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:23.520
and Reinhard

01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:25.520
Reinhard Reinhard Reinhard

01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:27.520
hi hey strongy

01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:29.520
I'm falling during

01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:31.520
us security

01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:33.520
at this convention

01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:35.520
I need to get back in shape for the event

01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:37.520
can I get some motivation

01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:39.520
for the gym please

01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:41.520
how are you supposed to breathe

01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:43.520
if you can't lift me every time

01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:45.520
I sit on your face

01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:47.520
now lift me

01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:49.520
or go home

01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:51.520
now

01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:53.520
is that the motivation you need

01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:57.520
I'm watching you during a workout

01:53:57.520 --> 01:53:58.520
risking the

01:53:58.520 --> 01:53:59.520
oh during work

01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:01.520
risking the job just for you

01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:07.520
let's see just wanted to say

01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:09.520
I've been loving your streams

01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:11.520
and the vids you upload especially the ASMR

01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:13.520
attend not to comment and stop because I'm kind of

01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:15.520
conscious of all this sort of stuff

01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:17.520
but don't send a supportive message

01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:19.520
to tell you keep up much love

01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:21.520
much love refling

01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:23.520
don't worry if you're shy it's perfectly okay

01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:25.520
I know you're there I can see likes

01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:27.520
on my videos

01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:29.520
I know you're leaving likes

01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:31.520
because you're so good to me

01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:35.520
hi strongy I love your laugh

01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:39.520
did you like when I couldn't stop laughing

01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:41.520
because I shoved an ear cleaner up my nose

01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:47.520
why would I want to breathe anything

01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:49.520
else after breathing you in

01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:51.520
just have incredible lung strength

01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:53.520
yeah I think that's probably

01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:55.520
pretty perfect

01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:57.520
yeah that guy's gonna be ripped

01:54:57.520 --> 01:54:59.520
why would I lift you though

01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:01.520
because you're not supposed to perish

01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:03.520
from sitting

01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:05.520
you're supposed to be able to push me off

01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:07.520
and throw me around

01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:09.520
bend me

01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:13.520
there that's all the motivation

01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:15.520
for the gym bros

01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:17.520
now for my architects however

01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:19.520
you keep eating that takeaway

01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:23.520
and for my beanballs

01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:25.520
don't worry all the better

01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:27.520
to throw you around

01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:31.520
I remember

01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:33.520
when you guys taught me

01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:35.520
of beanball men

01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:37.520
and it's a body type of beanball

01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:39.520
for skinny malinky guys

01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:45.520
oh yes chat struggling

01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:49.520
man

01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:51.520
what did I walk into

01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:53.520
a freaking ASMR nightmare

01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:57.520
thoughts on stoners

01:55:57.520 --> 01:55:59.520
I don't have any thoughts

01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:01.520
unfortunately

01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:03.520
I've never partaken

01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:05.520
in such a thing before

01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:07.520
but as long as you're happy

01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:09.520
I'm happy that's the main thing

01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:11.520
to be careful of your lungs

01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:13.520
however because you may

01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:15.520
have been fed

01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:17.520
a cheeky lie that

01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:19.520
it doesn't do any damage

01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:21.520
to your lungs but that's wrong

01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:23.520
it's smoke inhalation it does do damage

01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:25.520
so please do look after yourself

01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:27.520
and get yourself checked out

01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:29.520
if you have a reoccurring cough

01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:31.520
if you have a reoccurring cough

01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:33.520
please do get checked out

01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:35.520
for COPD

01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:37.520
very not fun condition

01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:39.520
so please do look after yourself

01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:43.520
unironically

01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:45.520
check out hearingstrone

01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:47.520

01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:51.520

01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:53.520
I want to say really inappropriate things

because I need to

01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:43.520
set up for a membership stream

01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:45.520

01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:47.520

01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:57.520
