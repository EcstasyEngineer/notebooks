1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
Loading, loading, almost there.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,880
OK, I think I'm live.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,680
Hello, Reflings.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,440
Can you hear us?

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,120
Reflings, wake up, wake up.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,200
OK, drama.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,920
I heard that room.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,800
Hello.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,320
Hello.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,200
I'm waiting for Chad to respond, just thinking.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,960
Oh, no, don't start puking.

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,880
Come on, it's a collab.

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,840
That's not how it works.

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,600
My puking.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,520
Hello, Krishnamarka.

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,240
Good morning.

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, OK, there we go.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,840
Good morning.

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,360
Good evening.

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,000
Good afternoon.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hi, Reflings.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,080
Hello.

23
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,800
Good morning.

24
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,600
Do you want to see the artedorary for today's collab?

25
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,760
Shall I get these lovely girls to introduce themselves

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,640
uno by uno?

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,640
Right, starting from my POV.

28
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,920
Peaches, would you like to introduce yourself?

29
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,280
Hi, I am Peaches.

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,360
And I don't even know how to play this game, so yeah.

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,720
None of us know who you are.

32
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,920
None of us know who you are.

33
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,800
Hank, would you like to introduce yourself?

34
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,920
Me?

35
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,520
Hello, I'm Baby Pink.

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,680
I also did not play this game, but I'll be Pink in the game,

37
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,080
so that's how you would know that's me.

38
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,680
I do ASMR, and that's it.

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,360
Hello.

40
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,440
Yay.

41
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,800
And then, last, but certainly not least.

42
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,360
Then, sister, who's Streamer, who never streams,

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,240
who just joined because he needed a filler?

44
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,240
What the fuck?

45
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,160
No, that's not how to play.

46
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,360
There's clearly a theme going on with this collaboration.

47
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,600
That's all I'm saying, OK?

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,800
There's clearly a fucking thing.

49
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,880
Like, we found out there's a colour red on this game.

50
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,720
They're like, oh, who's red?

51
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,600
I'll just get sinning.

52
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,480
No, that's how it is.

53
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,800
Get her in, guys.

54
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,880
So none of us, none of us have Castle Clashers experience.

55
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,480
Is that going to stop us?

56
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,480
No, so we're going to go in for the first time.

57
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,080
I mean, we might lose.

58
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,560
We're not going to mash buttons, you know?

59
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,360
The games, like, when you put up the games,

60
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,680
like, we recommend you use a controller.

61
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,920
And it's like, OK, I guess.

62
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,440
Geez, what's so complicated that a mouse and keyboard can't do it?

63
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,520
But, yeah.

64
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,480
You very wish us luck because this is going to go terrible.

65
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,680
We're going to introduce yourself as well, Strony.

66
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,120
Oh, hi.

67
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,560
I'm Strony Cuddles.

68
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,680
I am from Vealer, Gen 1, and Dulge.

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,680
I do do ASMR, but more on the Mimi side.

70
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,680
I'm not as serious as these lovely entourage with me normally do it.

71
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,000
So, yeah, thanks.

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And, yeah, thank you.

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,400
That's my intro. Thank you.

74
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,000
I was like, yeah, yes, thank you, Colab.

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,520
I didn't know I was a streamer.

76
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,440
I used some artists, but no.

77
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,680
I feel like you produce such professional, high-quality stuff.

78
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,440
And in me, I'm like, here's thigh cupping for 15 minutes.

79
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,000
Take it or leave it.

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,800
I literally did a role-play where I was a toaster.

81
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,600
OK, real though.

82
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,280
And I was a vodka bottle.

83
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,720
Take my craft very seriously.

84
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,320
Thank you very much.

85
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,320
I haven't got a hypnosis ASMR.

86
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,120
We're convinced you'll like pineapple and pizza.

87
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,040
Oh, it's been advertised for that, baby cakes.

88
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,720
Oh, my God, the stream delay for me is terrible.

89
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,160
Oh, wow, I look so dumb.

90
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,400
I love it.

91
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,360
Oh, my gosh.

92
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,200
We're so cute.

93
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,040
We're in a tavern.

94
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,640
Oh, my magic is like, it's like hearts.

95
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,760
You're magic.

96
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,680
Oh, my God, rainbow.

97
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,640
Oh, I'm farting.

98
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,600
Man's literally far.

99
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,720
Hold on a minute.

100
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,440
Oh, yeah, I have to talk to these guys.

101
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,440
Peaches, is your thing working?

102
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,320
I'm just, well, I'm trying to use my controller,

103
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,720
and it's not working.

104
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,200
Hold on.

105
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,680
If I have to use mouse and keyboard,

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,840
then I'll use mouse and keyboard.

107
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,640
No.

108
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,040
I think I do.

109
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,520
It's OK.

110
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,440
I'm a pro gamer.

111
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,400
I can do this.

112
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,680
MLG pro.

113
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,200
Is everything a pro?

114
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,800
Ah, bitch, you made my melody, Bob.

115
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,720
We also discovered this game apparently has a remaster,

116
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,440
and we played the old versions.

117
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,280
That's how you know we appreciate

118
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,680
the older version of games, exactly.

119
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,200
It's not about the graphics.

120
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,680
It's about the soul of the game.

121
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,360
Why would they remaster this masterpiece?

122
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,160
Exactly.

123
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,200
OK, so.

124
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,560
It's OK.

125
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,440
I'm learning.

126
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,720
Left trigger is your shield, OK?

127
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,400
Not bad, not bad.

128
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,360
OK, Peaches is attacking.

129
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,000
We're getting somewhere.

130
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,640
Yeah.

131
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,240
I can't believe your controller broke.

132
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,400
That's so weird.

133
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,320
What's this?

134
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,480
A snail?

135
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,480
For fuck's sake, is it the one that you just

136
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,680
got from someone?

137
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,840
I have to buy you a new one now.

138
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,800
No, I think my controller's all right.

139
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,080
It's just I don't know why it's not working with this game.

140
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,360
Do you need to go to like send input controller?

141
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,120
I don't know.

142
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,920
Can I start?

143
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,200
Do you want to?

144
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:43,960
What do I put on?

145
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,680
Wait a minute.

146
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,240
You got what?

147
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,000
I was going to turn you off.

148
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,680
Oh, can you not hear me?

149
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,840
Oh, fuck, you said you're going to fart.

150
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,600
I thought.

151
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,840
No, in game, in game, my ability is farting.

152
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,600
It's stop.

153
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,600
My ability is farting.

154
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,880
My in game fucking ability is farting.

155
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,600
It's poison gas.

156
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,720
I was like, wait, what are you guys on about?

157
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,200
I'm actually going to fart in the make, bro.

158
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,960
Oh, I mean, you do you.

159
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,840
I just thought you were.

160
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,320
I thought you were a real streamer.

161
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,000
If you if you loved the reeflings,

162
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
you'd actually fart stronger.

163
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,120
They always do that.

164
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,040
You guys always trying to like a what's the word?

165
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,480
Gilt trip made a fart in the make.

166
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,760
I'm like, bro, refling.

167
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,840
I'll burp in your mouth, but I think I draw the line of farting.

168
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,400
All right, is everyone are we able to move an attack?

169
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,200
Um, yeah, I guess for the yeah.

170
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,800
You're going to have to carry me because I am shit.

171
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,200
I will carry you.

172
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,600
None of us.

173
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,800
No, I'll carry you with the power of friendship.

174
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,680
The power.

175
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,640
Yeah, actually, I didn't really.

176
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,720
How much did you pay?

177
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,960
OK, just to give you some a tiny bit back.

178
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,920
Sorry, pink was really disappointed.

179
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,960
She couldn't be pink.

180
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,760
She left the game and came back after buying the DLC to be pink.

181
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,960
Hey, it was only, I don't know.

182
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,680
It was like five is what it, which is one euro.

183
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,640
I guess one year worth it.

184
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,480
As she be read.

185
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,160
Thank you for the red she be.

186
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,120
Hi, hear him or Harlot's vice versa.

187
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,920
Oh, we've started already.

188
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,000
None of us have played this game.

189
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,520
So don't expect anything.

190
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,720
Not one thing.

191
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,800
Hey, I played this far.

192
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,480
You got.

193
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,600
Wait, the king's up there.

194
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,680
He's telling us to go attack.

195
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,560
OK, OK.

196
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,200
There's a lot of dead people around.

197
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,480
When did the fight start?

198
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,640
I'm just farting as soon as I see someone.

199
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,520
Oh, no, those are all those are the enemies.

200
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,960
That's a brilliant skill.

201
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,200
I can't fucking.

202
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,080
Uh, how can I think I might need to make us a bit slower on this?

203
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,320
A smaller on the screen.

204
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,880
I think I'm covering up like all the gameplay.

205
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,400
Holy crap. Sorry.

206
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,280
Oh, yes, you get you guys go.

207
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,560
You just keep fighting ahead.

208
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,240
OK, you guys keep doing your feet.

209
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,520
Sorry, you're doing great.

210
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,880
Keep up that one.

211
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,000
You didn't think you didn't actually have to do that, too.

212
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,880
Yeah, I mean, I was literally looking at you.

213
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,560
Oh, I'm not in game.

214
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
You're like the money.

215
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,680
I'm your money.

216
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,200
I actually like you.

217
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,000
Right, OK.

218
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,440
It's not very worse than I make it worse.

219
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,640
I'm just covering up chat now.

220
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,360
I feel really bad.

221
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm sorry.

222
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,360
I'm sorry.

223
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,880
Thank you.

224
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,000
OK.

225
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,120
What was that?

226
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,800
I like that.

227
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,120
I don't know what it was, but.

228
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,920
OK, I'm ready.

229
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,640
I'm ready when you guys are.

230
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,000
OK, yeah, I'm back.

231
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,080
I think this is better.

232
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,200
It's fine.

233
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,680
Yeah.

234
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,840
I'm foreign.

235
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,080
I'm foreign.

236
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,600
I'm a poison damage them.

237
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,560
Actually, this kind of reminds me of

238
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,360
if you guys ever played in South Park, the stick of truth.

239
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,880
No, I've only watched it.

240
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,080
I only watched it.

241
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,360
I don't know why the combat is kind of reminded me of it.

242
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,920
Did we share?

243
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,120
No, there is the money here.

244
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,960
Oh, you got it.

245
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,800
Oh, my gosh.

246
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,600
We must save the princess.

247
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,240
Oh, my God.

248
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,360
Did you voice that princess meal?

249
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,480
What was it like working on the death team?

250
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,280
What was it like?

251
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,760
It was I earned for my DLC for pink.

252
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,920
Oh, that's how you.

253
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,200
Yeah, it was that voice line, the one voice line.

254
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,520
We're spamming, we're spamming.

255
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,160
Oh, my God, they won't die.

256
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,240
I'm not sure.

257
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,800
Give it a rest, buddy.

258
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,280
I'm not doing anything.

259
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,960
As long as you're spamming the bullets, the bullets,

260
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,160
there's no guns in this game.

261
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,200
So we just spamming the sword.

262
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,760
I'll be spamming the rainbow.

263
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,400
Literally, I'm far and all over.

264
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm getting that poison damage in.

265
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
I just have a fork.

266
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,480
I don't I don't do I have a lightning ability.

267
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,640
I don't know I use if you're on keyboard.

268
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,440
I don't know what your special ultimate would be,

269
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,520
but I think you might be the lightning one.

270
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,000
Oh, well, that's useful.

271
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,560
Electrifying.

272
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,960
Have a look.

273
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,280
We must protect beaches.

274
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,480
She's the new princess.

275
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,120
Protect me.

276
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,840
I'm trying to find out why I'm special.

277
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,240
Well, you have to do the sound.

278
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,560
Yeah, you have to do that.

279
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,080
The princess being taken away.

280
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

281
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,840
Oh, Mario.

282
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,560
Don't come.

283
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,440
You see that meme where it's like, dear Mario,

284
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,840
don't come to the castle.

285
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,360
I baked a cake and I completely fucked it up.

286
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,160
Don't come to the castle.

287
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,960
I love it so much.

288
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,400
Absolutely.

289
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,440
Oh, did you see that?

290
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,360
Did you see that video where peaches the whole version?

291
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,720
No, I don't think so.

292
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,080
Oh, God, there's like a video where the the peaches

293
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,800

Oh, what?

295
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,320
Wait, do you mean by giving it?

296
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,080
What do you mean?

She said, how?

298
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,880
I think I've seen that one personally.

299
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,200
No, I think you may be alone in this one.

300
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,600
I don't know what you're doing here.

301
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,440
No, it's so popular.

302
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,440
Wait, how does it go?

00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,640
Oh

359
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
No, wait, what have our lives?

360
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,040
This is terrible

361
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,840
This game honestly should be embarrassed to ever pick this collab. It was yeah, I would be

362
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,640
It was me. I picked this game. I thought it was a good club game, but it's like really hard

363
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,200
Oh my god, we died in the first boss battle

364
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,080
Please don't die in the first boss battle cry

365
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,160
Oh

366
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,240
The good touch

367
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,640
I think I'm very close to being dead and we are so done for

368
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,160
We are so done for

369
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,160
For

370
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,560
I really need to kill myself. Uh, what what the fuck do we get that they're healing?

371
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,080
Oh my god, nothing on your bumper stick

372
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:07,320
You press the little cup like a little healing thing potion. Yeah, but I don't have the potion. Oh shit

373
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
I got given one at the start of the game

374
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,880
Oh my god

375
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,080
Oh my god, we can't even without out. I'm trying bro the lag the lag

376
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,680
Someone please think of the lag for me and my ping is like a billion right now. I'm trying so hard to like

377
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,040
Spam my freaking poison

378
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,320
I don't know. Oh my god, the ping is so terrible

379
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,120
We're not even got it down to half health. I don't know how

380
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,920
I hate it. Oh

381
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,200
Do you heal? I don't I don't know. I feel like your rainbow thing should heal by the look

382
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
It's just visually visually

383
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,640
It's kind of

384
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,560
Spam double jump. I'm doubled. Yeah. I'm double jumping at the thing as well

385
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,480
Is this what we're supposed to do? This doesn't seem right

386
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,760
This doesn't

387
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,720
I mean, we need to buy something because we have money so I think we have to buy heels

388
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,240
Can't just swap the healer class. I mean, we're almost halfway on the machine thing now

389
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah, oh my gosh. Oh, we're actually doing something to it

390
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,680
Yeah, that's all we need is a wee bit a cheeky chip damage like a cheeky chip

391
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,320
Bro someone liked the comment and they were like you sound like you run a fish and chip shop and I'm like, thank you

392
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,760
I don't even know what to take from that

393
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,440
How many times I die now

394
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,960
We'll get you here. We'll we'll pay for heels. Where am I? I literally cannot see me go

395
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,080
I'm like jumping behind the thing swinging. There we go. There we go

396
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,720
We're almost we're almost there

397
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
Oh, oh, I have

00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,440
Thank you. I'm a nurse. I'm a field medic. I promise. Okay. No, I'm on the floor. That's what I'm

399
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,840
Okay, I'm open. I'm spinning. I'm spinning to win. No, I'm not I'm over here because I'm looking at sin

400
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,280
I'm not sin. I'm not sin. I'm green. I'm green. You're green

401
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:19,960
I'm literally going half. I'm like, I'm helping. I'm helping. I'm literally cutting the ear halfway down the map doing absolutely nothing from

402
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,960
You leave those molecules alone. I know

403
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,880
I could feel the oral I wiped up. That's nothing. I hate it

404
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,720
I know. Yeah, I know he doesn't but just the way it looks. Oh, oh you're leveled up

405
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Oh

406
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Oh my god

407
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:43,800
Now I can spin in a way all around I'll raise I'll raise I'll raise I'll raise if the game will register that I'm

408
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:52,600
Look at me spinning. Yes, but I'm all spinning. Oh, okay. Never mind. I'm official. Wait. Did peaches actually die die?

409
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Can I not raise her?

410
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
There's no why above peaches

411
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,240
It's over

412
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,200
It's over the dream run is over. There's the world record will not be obtained by us

413
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,560
There's no way

414
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,360
Hello

415
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,360
Hello. Oh, oh my god. We've almost got it though. We've almost got it

418
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,320
Oh

00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:33,160
Oh my god, and what do we just mourn over your body? No, right? I'm not going anywhere without you peachy

420
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,640
Very do we have to like drag? Oh, oh, oh, oh wait

421
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,480
Oh my god, you touched my boobies and now I'm back

422
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,160
I bashed them the right way. That's what it was. You did and brought me back to life

423
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,160
I couldn't do it with my manhands. It was letting me

424
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,680
Oh my god

425
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,800
Wayne

426
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,360
I can't believe we lost the boss loot because we didn't pick it up

427
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,720
video game hate

428
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,760
I have to say if you kill if you do a boss fight and then the loot like treasures will randomly disappear

429
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,200
Sorry, but uh hate developer hate because that's just really

430
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,960
I don't I don't see why you need to time it like I've just done this boss battle. Please give me a chance to pick up

431
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,800
Yeah, like the gold is

432
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,720
Literally if it's a actual gold coin, why would it randomly disappear?

433
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:31,160
I don't get it. We did not just sit on the floor. Is there like soil falling from the sky to cover it up that can't get it anymore

434
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,920
I'm chopping the fence chopping bits of wood up instead of actually trying to you know kill the fucking

435
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,200
When you play minecraft, do you do look?

436
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Do you do the caves or do you build a house?

437
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,120
I started to think you build houses then

438
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,720
Um, I don't yeah, I'm I'm being in here from all

439
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,360

I know the guys said something about my nun so I'm beating them up. Yeah. Oh, right. You leave my nun on

446
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,520
It's all about the respect

447
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,360
I've poisoned. I love poison damage. It's like the coolest thing in video games. I don't I don't care what anyone says

448
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,360

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,680
Did we get at least one princess by the end of the stream is my question

457
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,360
Or is that not how the game works is like I need more than one

458
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,360

459
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,840
Oh, that's what hard to work

460
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:38,760
On her I forgot to say by the way, I won't ask for more than two hours for the collab. I always I forgot to mention that

461
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,520
I

462
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,320
Never asked more than two hours because of the one anyone to be like, oh my god. I have to play for so long

463
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,000
But if any of you guys play valorous, let me move for no particular reason

464
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,560
Those are the princesses

465

Are you what rank through you? I don't even know how to rank through you. It doesn't work

689
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,840

692
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:17,400

695
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,840
No, what the fuck's happening?

696
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:42,200
We're in the nurse's office. Oh, oh, it's a stable. Oh wait, this is like a shite over here

697
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:49,400

705
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,480
I don't know. Oh my god. Okay. I don't think this will do anything. I think that I think he's yours. He's chosen you

706
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,640
He really said mommy

707
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,120
He's a weary flan. He said mommy instantly. I don't know how I did that

708
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,920
It does look like a whale

709
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,600
Yeah, a little worry boy

710
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,800
But you're cleaning after him

711
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,720
I'll gladly collect the poop

712
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,160
I guess we don't

713
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:53,560
Buy weapons upgrade this way. It must I don't think we are upgrading weapons. We're just getting new ones that that's it

714
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,920
You can just get new weapons and then it's just strength point

715
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:02,200
Okay, go. Yeah, go into the arena as well because we need to find the comfort stuff on the map

716
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,160
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't know what that meant

717
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:14,600
Oh, I've just put us in the fight. What what the what? Oh, no, wait. No, no. Oh, don't go to the edge. Don't go to the edge. There's cats

718
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,520
There's my pain

719
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:23,640
We're supposed to I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's right. Right. I'm just attacked. Just attack me when it's over here

720
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,120
Yeah, just attack and get us out here because

721
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,760
We're not supposed to be in here

722
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,720
I was looking for because the compass was at the thingy randomly. I was like, oh, we can just

723
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,200
Um, explore like fine. Yeah, like find the rest of them, but I guess no

724
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,120
You know what? I'll let them fight

725
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,600
No, no, no, no

726
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:51,480
I wanted to wait to wait for you guys to kill yourself, but then the kitty killed me. We are now dead

727
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,080
So that's my right. Right. Okay. Let's not ever do that again. Uh

728
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:02,200
Let's all agree to never do it. Right. So the blacksmith we found the compass home castle. It wasn't there

729
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,840
It wasn't in the castle keep either. So what it's just up

730
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,400
We just have to go up or we can't progress across the water. Basically

731
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,880
Okie dokie let's fucking go

732
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,160
Surely we won't get ambushed this time

733
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,120
Absolutely

734
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,680

735
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:28,280
Oh, golden whale just like produces money for you. Yeah, yeah

736
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,720
That's why his little poopies are we're not mad at cleaning up. Oh, they took golden poopies

00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,080
So then where do we buy?

738
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,840
We'll go back to that shop wherever it was

739
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,640
Even if we lose this one

740
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,440
And then we'll buy

741
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,680

Ah, it's the stun lock with the arrow hits. That's what's killing like absolutely throttling us

841
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:38,760
Again, you can cut grass for your snacks. Okay. No, that's the best method of healing but we can make it work. Okay, we can make it work

Oh, right. I'm doing heavy attacks. This is too much

853
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:24,040

935
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,640
You know, that's why they're pissing and shitting. It's not because of a scary fucking boss coming up or anything

936
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,560
I don't like this level. I'm sorry. Not the mirror. No, this is so hard

01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:57,240
Right, and then I guess I'll put in defense. Uh pressure got to me. They got to me. Okay

1003
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:01,400
I'm putting in defense so we can stay up longer. Uh

1004
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:09,880
Can't believe it. I need to put some in there. I love that strength. I love that magic. Jesus Christ. You got so many

1005
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:16,040
I'm just abandoning the last one. Oh my god. So you need to rename yourself spin sister

1006
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,240
Honestly, let's switch into my favorite

1007
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,800
Oh

1008
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:26,920
Did we just go again or do we like farm on ones that we've already done before there since

1009
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,920
I just want to buy more potions. Can we go back to potion? Oh, yeah

1010
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:35,000
And we just heels good call a castle keep that was a castle keep

1011
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,200
Can I really not buy heels for other people? Is that not a thing in this game?

1012
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:44,600
It does seem like a very like hey, this is a really common thing. Shouldn't this be implemented

1013
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,400
Smile, maybe this seems a freaking master

1014
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,800
So we're complaining

1015
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:56,600
Oh, honestly, it probably will be as well. Let me go now. It's all in the remaster

1016
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:05,240
Right, I think five potions is enough, you know, are we all happy we're a potion gathering how many do you have?

1017
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,600
Oh, that's enough

1018
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,600
truly five

1019
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:13,320
Don't watch the flex or anything. You know my five potions

1020
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:19,640
Mm-hmm, right at least we're leveling up like even though we lose and like the thing

1021
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:23,480
We're still getting the xp and the level up for it. So I'm not too like

1022
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,800
Oh, I'm region

1023
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,800
You know

1024
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:41,240
I'm spinning I'm spinning I'm spinning. Well, actually everyone just fucking spin it when spin only matter

1025
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,360
Oh my god, we've already phoned out the middle

1026
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:53,480
Shield and spin shield and a blade. Oh the shit. Oh, wait. Let's do the way. Why did he do that? But why?

1027
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,120
Is it because he's scared of the boss?

1028
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:05,320
He's terrified. I just realized it's he's not actually coming. It's it's the bird poop

1029
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,280
You saw the

1030
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:14,920
Yeah, the brain rock has got to pink the brain rock has officially hit. Do you do you know how birds have sex?

1031
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
They just rubbed their butts together

1032
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,240
Whoa

1033
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,480
Honestly, that sounds pretty cute

1034
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,440
That's the milliest that's the milliest thing I ever heard

1035
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,720
Let's rub our butts together

1036
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,960
Butt rubbing uh

1037
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,440
VTuber convention one

1038
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,920
Uh, I'm down

1039
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,840
I'm on you. You know weapon

1040
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,200
Break

1041
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,760
Oh my gosh

1042
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:52,200
It's not enough to have your shield out. You must be facing the same way the arrow comes out. I can't believe it

1043
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,760
I can't believe I can't just cheese this game

1044
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:00,840
Whoa, I haven't I haven't I haven't maled it. What what is it's when?

1045
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:06,200
I think you just picked up there was another location. Oh, no, no, no again. Not again

1046
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,080
Oh

1047
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,680
I wish we had flowers like this

1048
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,160
New character unlocked and he's just brown

1049
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:21,240
Right, your fish is lodey. They keep dropping coins. Where's the girls?

1050
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:25,560
Bruh, I don't know. I think he just like breathes oxygen and turns it into

1051
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:31,560
Oh

1052
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,800
That covers up so much of the screen that notification

1053
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,360
Yeah

1054
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,360
Oh

1055
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:47,000
That's mine already has that. Wait, I dropped my sword. Give me a bag. This is my sword. Give me the sword. Okay. Oh, okay

1056
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,880
No, no, no, no, you never took it from me. Wait

1057
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,200
What?

1058
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,200
I pressed eggs. Okay, then swap

1059
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:57,160
I could have had a bang in sword then

1060
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,040
So we could have done treesies

1061
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,160
But now we have the

1062
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,960
I can swing my sword. I guess this is a hammer

1063
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:21,800
I want more creeps creep fight me

1064
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,520
Oh

1065
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,840
Hmm

1066
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:31,560
Bruh, they have so much hp as well

1067
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,880
Or is this no, I guess it's like a zombie

1068
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,240
Maybe

1069
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:45,640
No, I don't want the stick give me the mallet. Thank you. I don't want to

1070
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:50,120
Wait, I'm stuck. I'm stuck. You need to come back. I'm sorry

1071
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:51,640
I

1072
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:54,760
Wait, why is this thing wrapped up? Give me the mallet. Hmm

1073
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:58,280
Or is this like a hidden thing?

1074
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:02,360
It makes my strength go down but makes my magic go up. Hold on a minute and boost my magic up

1075
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:07,480
That's all I care about. Hey, wait, I'm like stop go around. Thank you. Jesus

1076
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,200
Game's so rude

1077
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,240
Oh

1078
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,240
Not again. Uh, no again

1079
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,640
Yes, again

1080
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:22,680
Oh, no, you can see it come up his face and everything. That was a violent one

1081
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:26,440
Oh my god, that's me after I ate soy honestly

1082
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Just shut up your back

1083
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,520
I mean, yeah

1084
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,520
and I was

1085
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:39,320
And I started being allergic to soy like recently and I guess where soy is in

1086
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,960
Everything. Yeah

1087
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,480
Especially Asian foods

1088
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,720
Oh, is that like your favorite food type?

1089
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,840
Pretty much. Oh, no, I would

1090
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:57,320
I really like Mexican food and I have that thing where is it like cilantro tastes like soap

1091
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,280
Oh

1092
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,880
Yeah, many people like cilantro. I don't really mind it

1093
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:10,920
Okay, okay, no one go in the fire. Let's keep our HP as high as possible

1094
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:18,760
Okay, they're running away from the boss, but we're gonna farm them for xp because they should have thought about it before the attack does

1095
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:24,440
Okay, I'm not good. Not going to the fire. You say no fire fire bed. Okay fire bed

1096
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:29,480
I'm gonna bun go fire bed. Well, it's good. Let's keep this one. Wait. Where's the boss?

1097
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:36,040
Oh, I spoke too soon. Right. He's coming. All right. I'm spamming. I'm spamming. I'm spamming. I'm spamming. I'm spamming

1098
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,040
Oh

1099
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,480
Spamming your magic on him

1100
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,760
Spamming magic

1101
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,840
Magic

1102
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Oh gosh, please

1103
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:52,360
So they can go on fire if you want to try and

1104
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,400
Utilize it

1105
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,640
Let's stop with the thing

1106
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,120
Jump meta jump meta

1107
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,120
Pink level up pink level up jump meta

1108
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,840
I'm doing the the sin strategy. It literally is working. It's working. It's working so well

1109
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,240
That was our problem whole time

1110
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:17,400
I can't believe you've burst the meta. If it's okay, I'll take it's really

1111
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,680
I'm gonna make a youtube video right now about this new meta, you know

1112
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,640
How old is this game? Is this like a

1113
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,720
They can't like try to tell her something

1114
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,080
Never too late for a meta, you know

1115
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,840
literally

1116
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,840
Ah, I need to hit poison

1117
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,960
Because it's doing so much tick damage on him. It's so good

1118
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,240
Oh, there's so many of the baddies

1119
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,680
Buddy over here

1120
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:49,000
Please do not sunlock me. I'm trying so hard to win right now. I'm trying so hard

1121
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:52,760
Okay, it seems like I hate to admit it. I hate to admit it

1122
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:57,160
But I think I'm investing in the defense might have helped. I hate to admit it, but

1123
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,120
I literally never touched the

1124
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:08,040
Oh, I oh you mean the stats. Yeah. Yeah, like when we leveled up the we'd put some into defense and never like that was easy

1125
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,360
Yeah, that was like chat was tried

1126
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,120
Chat was right once again. I can't believe it

1127
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:19,080
We did it. Wait, what are they all running for? Oh, I I don't know. Oh

1128
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,320
There's more wait that wasn't it. We've not finished the level

1129
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,720
Oh

1130
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:32,760
Oh my gosh

1131
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:36,040
Oh my god, I'm on a deer. I'm on a deer. I'm on a deer. I'm off

1132
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:43,080
Oh, I want to do that the poops jump jump jump keep jumping keep jumping jump jump jump jump jump

1136
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,920
Oh, I go ahead

1137
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,760
Do you guys still have potions?

1138
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,960
Yeah, yeah, I just I just use one. Okay. Oh

1139
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:12,040
How are we supposed to know come on? How are we supposed to see the doorway?

1140
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:17,320
Yeah, how are we supposed to see it? That's not enough time for me every act. That feels that feels random on them

1141
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,960
I cannot anticipate the road ahead. Okay. Yeah

1142
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:24,520
Like as long as one of us makes it to the end we win

1143
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:30,920
As long as one of us makes it to the end we win surely this sequence wait, are we supposed to be attacking him or something? No

1144
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,400
Bruh, these walls

1145
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,840
Oh my god, wait the light on the floor

1146
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,400
The light on the floor the light on the floor

1147
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,080
That's the best I can do

1148
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:45,640
Is the light on the floor for the doorway and then there's the jumps of course to make it nice and awkward

1149
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,040
Oh

1150
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,400
Okay, okay, okay

1151
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:59,880
We did it we're safe. We had to be pink behind

1152
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,200
Pink Spain she was just taking a nap

1153
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:07,560

1154
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,440
Ow. Oh my god, the rock's not cute

1155
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:12,840
I want to be on a fish

1156
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:17,160
Apparently you're supposed to stay in the middle. Oh my god. I'm getting beat up. I'm getting beat up

1157
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:21,320
I don't know by what I'm spend matter spend it win spend it win

1158
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:28,440
It keeps us out of the water long enough. How did we end up here? Oh, you can get on a log

1159
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,440
Oh

1160
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Wait

1161
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, I just got knocked off. Oh, but how are we supposed to right spin spin?

1163
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,680
What the hell is this?

1164
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,600
Oh my gosh, I know but it doesn't

1165
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:57,880
There's no way we're supposed to actually win at this rate

1166
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,240
I can't even jump on something right

1167
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,040
Do not knock me off. I had to go fast boy

1168
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:08,760
Bruh the rocks that knock you off. I can't even do any spell casting

1169
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,600
Oh my god, I'm just getting knocked off more. Okay. Can we only jump?

1170
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:18,040
Yep, the best I can do is literally spin on his arse

1171
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:23,320
Doing a 360

1172
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:27,960
No scope. We can't even kill it like he doesn't have any

1173
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,520
All right, the best I can ride the show

1174
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:36,120
Oh, right. I'm I got some poison on. I'm geez

1175
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,080
No, there's another one go away

1176
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:51,400
Okay, so it can be killed what we don't he don't don't see hp level that's why it was confused lovely mystery

1177
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:54,120

1178
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,600
How

1179
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:04,120
I wish you could pick a level and then be like do you want to play easy mode? Yes. I want to play easy mode. Thank you

1180
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,120
I

1181
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:14,440
Just got knocked off. What mode are we playing there? There's only one d4 like so. Yeah, there's only one

1182
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,840
Ah sin got the fish

1183
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,560
Oh

1184
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,960
I wish you had a pet

1185
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:26,440
Okay, spam in the poison and then I get knocked off instantly as soon as I get on a platform

1186
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,600
You're so strong. You don't need a pet

1187
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,760
I'll let you know jupo, but you will get it eventually

1188
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:37,480
Eventually and then to be like the most powerful one. Yeah, you'll have the best

1189
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Yeah, I get unicorn pet

1190
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:48,360
Poison poison no, and then I get knocked off instantly by the rock. I don't know who designed this level

1191
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,160
This is

1192
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,280
This is awful

1193
01:16:54,280 --> 01:17:00,600
I don't know what our goal is we're to kill the damn frog thing and obviously my best damage is

1194
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,400
When I'm on a platform

1195
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,800
and off it's teaching

1196
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,720
Literally all we can do

1197
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:16,280
And I've got two potions that are about to get freaking wasted on this fight because it the rocks keep knocking me off

1198
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:18,280
So I can't even do any magic

1199
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,840
Get me on the fucking crocodile

1200
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:23,080
Oh, please no more another one's gonna

1201
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Wrap it up wrap it up

1202
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,760
Wrap it up

1203
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:31,640
Wrap it up. We've had enough of this level and there's a back

1204
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:38,040
Oh, and I'm off the platform again. So I can't do anything. It's supposed to be easy to frog

1205
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,840
A spiky frog. I can't use this. I hate that sound he makes

1206
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,720
And I'm not

1207
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,200
I'm not

1208
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:52,600
I can do 10 damage with magic and then I instantly get fucking knocked off so I can't

1209
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:54,920
Right now it makes me burp

1210
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,920
She's fuming

1211
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,120
Bruh

1212
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:01,240
I like let me be on the and then it's like as soon as I get on it

1213
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:06,200
It's like oh, here's a rock to knock you off it. It was like, okay. Thanks. I didn't want to use any of my magic

1214
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:10,760
Remember that dog fish you put in the game that big ass mechanic where

1215
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,560
What the fuck

1216
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:15,560
Oh, it's the king

1217
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,640
The king came to help us

1218
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:25,640
Oh, oh my god. No, we don't have there's we don't have the team for a freaking boss battle. Are you kidding us?

1219
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:32,360
Oh, I just got walloped. I just that's a catfish clearly. Oh, yeah. Oh my god. Yeah

1220
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,960
Uh, where am I? I can't I can't

1221
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:40,280
Why did that kind of look like can you use the cannonball?

1222
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,160
Oh, it's like so much that we can help them

1223
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,720
I know

1224
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:50,440
I I can play so am I too dumb guys my point is nothing

1225
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,840
Ow

1226
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:58,440
Bruh, this is all in one level by the way like

1227
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:05,960
It goes on forever. I think we're gonna have to farm on other things to level up before we freaking do this guy

1228
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,160
One damage by the way

1229
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,960
One damage by the way

1230
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:18,600
One damage, I guess I need to put it in defense so my melee's more effective because this is like

1231
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,480
Pishwa capital ish

1232
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:28,680
Why is it the cannonball perfectly hits the frog but as soon as it comes to the big massive hitbox target

1233
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,760
All of a sudden the king canny day pish

1234
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,040
That's a little excessive

1235
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:40,200
Like I feel like this is target. He doesn't want us to get the princesses because it doesn't like his doors

1236
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:42,840
Just admit it. You didn't like your door

1237
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,920
Oh, the king has a shield

1238
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:51,640
Oh, I forgot about that shield. Can you even use no, you can't use a shield on the water. No, you can't

1239
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Oh, that sucks so much in the water

1240
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,480
Yeah, I take that

1241
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,560
I'm not even doing poison damage

1242
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:05,240
Bro, I'm useless. I'm actually useless this fight completely and wholeheartedly useless

1243
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:08,600
You're alive. That's that's useful. Yeah

1244
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,880
Me and pink are the true useless

1245
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:14,200
No, no, no, it's because I've managed a bit

1246
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:21,560
I'm a fraud. I'm a fraud. It's because my a pet gives me money for more potions so I can stay up for longer

1247
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,360
I'm a fraud

1248
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:28,040
You found out my secret. I thought you were just a mega gamer girl

1249
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:32,120
I can't believe you had to find out this way. I'm a bad

1250
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:34,680
I'm a lot broken

1251
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,040
Oh, come on. It's thin on the other hand. I don't know how you have so much like

1252
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,960
You just don't die

1253
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,680
She's the original

1254
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:50,120
I'm just

1255
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,080
I don't

1256
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:55,480
Like

1257
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:03,080
Okay, so I'm not paying my taxes to the kingdom after this if this is how my cannonballs are going down

1258
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,160
Are you joking like they wonder so much about this

1259
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:12,280
No, don't give up and look at the king. He's he's just screaming and covering himself

1260
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,200
I didn't even helping or if he's you're like

1261
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,360
I think this is just screaming at you guys a fake boss fight honestly

1262
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:25,000
I'm gonna sit back and let's try to spin it. No, I'm trying to spam

1265
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,880

01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:43,960
I'm farting. Okay. There we go. I'm doing nine damage

1267
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:47,720

01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:32,520
Why does it not register an attack if you hit an enemy on his back? Is he gonna be like sauce? No damage

1322
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,840
No

1323
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,920
We have to like line with the cat up

1324
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:43,160
This is uh, I don't oh my god. Stop. Oh my god. I can't reach it at all. They will all they will shoot

1325
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:48,920
Oh my god

1326
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:53,960
Stop oh my god

1327
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:57,480
Oh my god

1328
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,600
You are

1329
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:07,640
That was awful. That's the longest time it took anyone to do this stage for real

1330
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:14,600
That was a road record for sure. I don't think anyone spent that line for time on that. No, holy shit. That was awful

1331
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:23,160
That was amazing. That was amazing for us. I'm doing all magic. I'm doing all magic. That literally is the only reason why

1332
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,240
Oh, okay. Um

1333
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:29,320
That was terrible

1334
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:32,280
Who made this game so hard? I need a word with the development team

1335
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:41,240
I'm sure there's like something obvious. I'm scared to go into the next let's go back for potions. Fuck this. I'm going back. Wait, what?

1336
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:45,960
Oh, dub dub dub. Just screaming at me that I have to leave the fence

1337
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:50,200
There's like so many new areas on launch. Thieves forest is what we were in

1338
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:52,920
Thieves store. We got more items. Oh

1339
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:58,440
Hello, I don't even have money. I don't know why I'm excited. We have bumps

1340
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:02,920
We have bombs. I just want two potions and that's it

1341
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:07,960
I guess if we're not doing a boss fight just yeah, I won't buy a bomb. I'll buy hell

1342
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:16,520
No, it's Bravo. He he he he. Hello. What what thieves have a store. What the fuck?

1343
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:22,200
Okay, I have a bomb as well. I'm not really sure how to drop it, but we'll do it at some point

1344
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,800
I want a bomb there girl

1345
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,880
I feel like it should be fair to

1346
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,840
steal from the thief store

1347
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,720
honestly

1348
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:37,800
Thieves charge more money for potions. Are you sick? Oh, do we just get skimals?

1349
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:42,040
I think we wouldn't skimals. Do we need to go back to the pets

1350
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:47,080
Section so you guys can read what your pets there or anything like that. Oh, yeah, maybe

1351
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:55,320
Right, I'll take us back to the little no not that way down down left left left left left

1352
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,200
Left not that one

1353
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,680
Not that one home castle

1354
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,640
Why no wrong one one

1355
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:07,720
Wrong one. Wait, it wasn't home castle. What one is it with the lady?

1356
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:12,040
Oh, no, it was that the wait. Why is there what?

1357
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Ah, this is just the first map

1358
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,800
Oh, I'm an idiot

1359
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,880
Sorry, I just made us replay an old mission. Sorry

1360
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:28,120
Sorry, right. It was the blacksmith. That was it. It was left of the blacks like we go in the blacksmith

1361
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,160
Oh, can't wait can't wait. Oh, okay

1362
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:39,400
Oh my god, I did powerful. Oh my god

01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,200
Let's get one shot in

1364
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:44,840
Oh my god, the magic actually

1365
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:51,160
As long as my magic hits. I'm actually not useless for the team club club club

1366
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:57,720
As long as it hits though. Yeah, I'm just gonna spin in the corner. I just want a pet

1367
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:02,360
That's what I want. That's my pet because seahorse a fish. That's my favorite scene

1368
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,960
I can exit to map if you guys don't want to play this

1369
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:08,920
Yeah, we can exit. Okay, hold on

1370
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:13,480
Are you sure? Yes

1371
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:18,840
Okay, blacksmith and then left is the animal body

1372
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,800
Okay, here you go

1373
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,600
That's about the power

1374
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:29,400
I will let retrieves hidden fruit from trees. The golden whale earns you more. No shit

1375
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:38,840
Oh, you mean this whale that drops gold it drops gold. Oh, okay. Got you. What about the weapon lady?

1376
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:46,840
Seahorse lets you move. Maybe that's not the one that I think through water quickly. Oh my god, wait

1377
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,920
I'm so sorry. What do we want here?

1378
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:51,560
Peach is so such a

1379
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:58,440
Okay. Oh, yeah. What does what does the seahorse this makes her move through water quickly? That's it. It's a jelly

1380
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:01,320
Nothing else

1381
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,440
You're drowned quickly

1382
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:14,200
I don't wait been a pet. Oh, no, I just lost my pet. Oh, well, do you want to wait you want to

1383
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:20,200
He goes if you don't if you go near the bend your pet will unfollow you and he's away over here

1384
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:23,480
Right. Okay. You have the pet. You have the pet. There you go. I just want a pet

1385
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:28,360
Wait, is that a more further down? Is that what it is? Yeah, that's the only one only a fish

1386
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,800
Is that a whale? Oh, yeah, only a whale. All right. I'm out. Oh, he dropped money

1387
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
He drops my touch him and he'll come with you

1388
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:37,720
That's enough to stash him three two one

1389
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:39,720
Oh

1390
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:43,160
Come on. Good. He doesn't like to be touched anymore. He doesn't like what?

1391
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:44,840
Does he only

1392
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,840
Wait, what?

1393
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:49,160
They have a preference. It's then

1394
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:52,840
I see. Oh, okay

1395
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,720
Get some petless maiden lives. What else pets have

1396
01:30:56,760 --> 01:31:00,360
I think their character locked pets. Oh

1397
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,160
All right, so

1398
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:07,240
Oh, there were weapons. Oh, I don't even have money. We did have more choices

1399
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:10,040
Choices

1400
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
There's like a weird middle. Oh

1401
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:17,560
Whoa, it keeps going

1402
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:21,640
Masi would like these ones. Oh, that's defense

1403
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:25,560
Oh, I want this look

1404
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:27,960
Why not? I have defense now

1405
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:33,560
Yeah, nice. Those are defendables. Yeah, maybe I won't die so fast. No

1406
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:35,560
Oh

1407
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:42,840
I like your pose when you do that. You like stick your finger out pink. Yeah. Oh, you just be sane

1408
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:47,080
I'm just like, yeah far

1409
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:50,120
Come on. What was yours again?

1410
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Your ultimate

1411
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,400
Like your oh

1412
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:01,400
That's making cold not the red ranger

1413
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:05,560
Of course

1414
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:12,680
Right, let us right. So we went to look at one. So we've not done the abandoned mill. Wow. Look at that one there

1415
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:17,880
I wonder if there's a boss in that next there. Oh wait, we did just do the abandoned mill. Did we not?

1416
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:21,480
I'm so confused. Oh

1417
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:26,440
Oh, we did all of this in a row. Oh, I kept putting us through missions

1418
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:28,920
I thought that was one big long ass mission

1419
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:31,800
It kept making us go next I guess

1420
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:36,520
So this is the next level

1421
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:38,920
Yeah, the king's let us off

1422
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,400
Oh my god, I'm going straight to the fire

1423
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:50,200
Beeline for it. Okay, so we need to get ready for it. Is that flag like a cute little pole?

1424
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:53,080
Yeah, it does

1425
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:00,920
Visit me for more weapons and scissors. Does anyone I know it's less magic. I like not

1426
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:07,240
I'll take my chances. I'll take my chances. Oh for some reason my scissors give me defense

1427
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:12,280
Oh, that's so cute. Oh one just rolled dead even more

1428
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:17,480
Uh, oh my god. Yeah a little bit. It's like mr. Cuddle's cousin

1429
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:25,240
Man, they take a hammer and 24 hit on the snot and they still aren't dying

1430
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:27,880
I

1431
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:32,680
Can't believe we're fighting the snowberries. I see don't look. I'm sorry

1432
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:38,920
Let what

1433
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
We're fighting daddus

1434
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:46,360
We're literally the daddus are coming. Oh, no. Oh, I don't know if you guys had that book

1435
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:49,320
Yeah

1436
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:52,040
Oh

1437
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,480
And eat back off

1438
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:59,560
Right, I need to I need to play this at a major's range if I'm gonna literally spam down major because yeah, I'm gonna get in trouble

1439
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:04,120
I can't see

1440
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:10,520
I can't see there's so much visual clutter on screen and the bears are like leveling up as well

1441
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:16,200
Oh, they're like bubbles. Yeah bubbles coming from them. They're taking bubble baths

1442
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,800
We're taking bubble baths for

1443
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:25,880
Uh

1444
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:29,000
We seem okay in quotation marks

1445
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:31,480
But yeah

1446
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:33,320
Levelers

1447
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:36,040
You get fully healed as well when you level up. It's really good. There's a

1448
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:40,520
Oh, I love that. Oh that little do you see that little creature?

1449
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:42,520
Oh

1450
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:47,640
Oh my god, new pet. Oh my god. It's it's it's it's like a flag and spinning

1451
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:52,920
You play league. Oh, no, I'm any end. I used to I'm sorry

1452
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:56,120
Oh

1453
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:01,160
But but do you like you like poison damage over time you'd look female

1454
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:07,000
Oh, it says that wait. Is there a poison character now? Hold on. Yeah, what's the mushroom?

1455
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,960
Hold on a minute

1456
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:13,720
Oh, you have to play now. I'll I volunteer to play with you

1457
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:21,960
I was going to see if Azura would do me an introduction stream because she loves it. Like she adores the legend

1458
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:23,960
Um

1459
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,880
But that's why I thought about the valorant thing as well

1460
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:30,120
I was like, I'll never really played it. It'd be funnier if like vtubers like showed me how to play it type thing

1461
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:33,000
And it could be like a fun to have I just feel like I'm going for it

1462
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:39,160
I'm in and I'm being like getting flashbanged every screen because I know that apparently the games uh all the enemies and

1463
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:42,200
Like can flash it a lot in

1464
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:48,360
valorant and I was like I'll have my reactive model on so like I constantly get like flashbang

1465
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:50,120
to

1466
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:52,120
every two seconds

1467
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:57,240
Are we supposed to be doing something about that hurricane?

1468
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:02,360
Oh, it's a boss fight. Oh my god. I was too

1469
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:07,240
Meanwhile, there's a boss in the background

1470
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,960
Yeah

1471
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:13,960
But don't worry. It's us since goddess

1472
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:18,440
It'll actually send all just clutch up. It's fine. We don't have to do anything. Let her deal with us. No pressure. No pressure

1473
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:20,600
There's you last game. It's at the narration

1474
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:23,480
I was Kazama. Um

1475
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:26,200
What is it called

1476
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:29,880
My magic literally once he got stunned all of a sudden he was like super

1477
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:31,880
like

1478
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:37,720
In trouble. I'm level 12. No, that can't be right. There's no way I'm level 12. I miss Ruta

1479
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,600
Are we checking exactly? I don't know

1480
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:48,120
The the one that keeps going into a hurricane is the boss. He's constantly see he's got like an arm anymore

1507
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:51,800
Right, can I get res? cheeky res cheeky res

01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,720
And then the aggro's off of me. I can raise another

1512
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:17,320
Okay, okay. I'll just lay here and no no I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm just trying to get the bears to take the freaking aggro

Oh, I have a new pet. Oh, but but but the sea can you play with something?

1520
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:53,560

Oh my god, that doesn't happen

1522
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:01,560
My sea horse is left. I can be your pet sin

1523
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:05,240
Okay, okay. Okay. Yeah, let's go there to match

1524
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:09,560
Oh, I don't have to HP for this. Oh, actually none of us do

1525
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:12,120
so my power sin is uh

1526
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:17,240
I will get you up if you die, but most of the times you have to get me up

1527
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:21,240
We just have to go together

1528
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:24,600
Lie down. Someone throw me. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no

1529
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:32,680
I'm trying to get him from afar with this magic. Yeah, I'm just trying to stay far

1530
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:36,760
Too dangerous

1531
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,200
Okay, I think that's

1532
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:42,360
It for now

1533
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:47,160
Maybe please please be the end of the map. I have literally five HP to my name

1534
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:50,440
And there's no grass to chop to get like fruit from

1535
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:53,560

I'm ready. It's in my magic. Um, oh

1586
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:27,160
Slimes from the ceiling

1587
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:30,040
Oh my god, they turn into weird slimes

1588
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:34,840
Oh, no no no no no. No, I just have to appreciate the sign this way for the same cloak in

1589
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:41,480
Oh

1590
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:50,760
I'm lagging out. I'm lagging out. I have aggro. What do you mean your aggro is on toggle?

1591
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:53,800
If I sun-cooled then you're the 10

1592
01:44:55,720 --> 01:44:57,720
This little random world of warcraft

1593
01:44:57,720 --> 01:45:03,760
Oh someone's in the ground someone's been attacked by a slime. I'm getting tracked by a slime. Oh, she's down

1594
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:10,040
She's like I'm the game that gets me. It's the first you tell me and hentai goes down next you tell me a slimes

1595
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:11,740
Got you. I can't believe it

1596
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:13,740
Let's just hug in my face

1597
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:18,160
There is that new alien movie apparently everyone appreciates face huggers more

1598
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:23,080

1599
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:26,080
Oh

1600
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:28,560
No, they multiply

1601
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:36,520
As long as I thought at first the little tech like the blue blobs that come off of them was them splitting into even smaller stuff

1602
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:38,520
And I'm kind of glad it's not like that

1603
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:42,200
I'm very glad the developers weren't that evil

1604
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:44,760
Because they could have easily done that

1605
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:51,680
Did they even hurt us are they hurting us or are we just killing them that no one's getting damaged

1606
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:54,940
Oh, no, yeah, if they jump on your face

1607
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:04,040
I mean the corksies and bones around us like of course

1608
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:09,720

It seems if you guys have magic it seems to take quite a wall open from my magic. I don't know I

1614
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:41,520
Think I'm magic

Oh my god, we're getting jumped. Oh

1622
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:23,200

1623
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:26,080
And then fight and then resin fight them resin fight them

1624
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:30,000
But I mean it's working. I'm not

I think it disappears after he gets a kill. Maybe he like has to go away and digest this food and then he comes back

He's like, okay, let's look. Okay. It's a loot goblin. Yeah. Okay that

Oh my god, I cannot melee at all. There's like no damage in my melee whatsoever. I'll thank him. I might

Because I don't want to do anything else between

1970
02:11:53,660 --> 02:11:55,660
Doing better than me

1971
02:11:56,780 --> 02:11:58,780
What

1972
02:12:00,300 --> 02:12:06,620
Critical see I feel like we never get critical hits. I don't know how to upgrade like to get there are critical hits

1973
02:12:07,340 --> 02:12:10,140
Yeah, they're so rare. Literally they hardly show up at all

1974
02:12:10,940 --> 02:12:16,460
Oh, this is like a boss fight. Well, uh, well, it's been a good stream. Thanks everyone. Huh

1975
02:12:19,980 --> 02:12:21,980

1984
02:12:58,460 --> 02:13:03,820
Oh, well, I felt like we were actually going into a pub for a second there. I got excited. I was like, oh, I'm putting my order in

1985
02:13:03,980 --> 02:13:05,980
That would be nice. Well, then

Oh my god, can my mana come back faster, please

1988
02:13:25,420 --> 02:13:31,020
No, no, it's fine. It doesn't bother me at all that it takes half an hour for me to do one attack. No, I'm sure

1989
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:35,180
I'm not a detriment to my teammates at all. I'm sorry. There's so much

1990
02:13:35,900 --> 02:13:40,700
No, no, no, no, no, it's cuz it's cuz we're keep going into the next level without resupplying

1991
02:13:41,580 --> 02:13:45,180
Because I don't actually know when the next level starts. We're just like keep going forward

1992
02:13:46,700 --> 02:13:49,740
I don't even have money though. Look how much money features guys

You can deposit them for that

1995
02:13:58,060 --> 02:14:00,060
Well

2008
02:14:55,660 --> 02:15:00,220

02:15:09,340 --> 02:15:11,340
Okay, right

02:15:11,580 --> 02:15:14,620

2029
02:16:39,100 --> 02:16:41,100
So, uh, yes, I'm trying

That's why I need one teammate off and then I'll go for sin because this guy's over here

2037
02:17:11,260 --> 02:17:12,540
and then we'll get

2039
02:17:13,580 --> 02:17:14,860

02:17:14,860 --> 02:17:16,460

02:17:35,340 --> 02:17:38,780
Oh, I don't know what that lightsaber is. I need the defense scissors

2047
02:17:39,340 --> 02:17:43,340
We're so ready for the boss. We're so ready. Oh, he's crying

2048
02:17:44,380 --> 02:17:47,980
How the fuck is he though? He's not the groom. Whoa

2049
02:17:48,620 --> 02:17:51,020
Is he the secret lover as I thought?

2050
02:17:52,380 --> 02:17:53,900

Okay, oh, he doesn't seem to take poison damage. So this is literally my worst matchup possible. I was not really work

2057
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:26,140
Did anything work on him or is this melee sins the strongest melee wise out of all of us so

2058
02:18:27,100 --> 02:18:31,740
This might be a sin boss fight unironically. Okay. Well, I died but I got to enough

No, no, that's fine. Oh my god, you have six level up points. No, we can do this. Sorry. We can do

2063
02:18:52,940 --> 02:18:59,500

2064
02:19:01,100 --> 02:19:03,100
Oh, the magic

Yes, no, I literally

2097
02:21:07,020 --> 02:21:10,060
V shipper holds others hostage just to complete her game

2098
02:21:11,260 --> 02:21:13,260
Just so she can get a princess

2099

02:21:49,660 --> 02:21:52,060
No, you don't it's not your game type. What is your game type?

2108
02:21:53,500 --> 02:21:54,300

strategy games

2110
02:21:57,260 --> 02:22:01,660
I saw you play boulders gate actually all three of yous were on boulders gate shagging it

2111
02:22:02,460 --> 02:22:04,460
Yeah, like

2112
02:22:07,180 --> 02:22:11,580
I had to play if you do some strategy, so main piece you would just get naked and pinks like, okay

2113
02:22:11,580 --> 02:22:14,940
We're going here next up to them next and like piece. Just like look at my boo

2114
02:22:18,140 --> 02:22:20,140
That's lovely. Yeah

2115
02:22:20,620 --> 02:22:24,140
And her is the only one that can romance a starry and I'm actually raging about them

2116
02:22:26,540 --> 02:22:31,100
How does the multiplayer work in that game? Do you have your own character or?

2117
02:22:32,140 --> 02:22:36,780
Oh my god, I'll play the you can play the the original character who made your own. Oh, okay

2118
02:22:40,780 --> 02:22:45,980
Uh, I think I think I'm in any games kind of category as long as it's not hard then I'm fine

2119
02:22:45,980 --> 02:22:50,300
Oh my god, I can blast off with a far. Oh, I'm blasting off again

2120
02:22:53,420 --> 02:22:55,420
It won't stop

2121
02:22:55,500 --> 02:23:01,100
That's terrible. How old am I literally a five year old child? Tee hee farts are funny

2122
02:23:03,260 --> 02:23:05,260
Farts are deadly in this game. Oh

2123
02:23:07,260 --> 02:23:09,260
A bit too potent and

2124
02:23:09,900 --> 02:23:16,300
Right pink. I'm gonna get you to hold back so because I have more potions than you so you do magic from afar

2125
02:23:17,660 --> 02:23:19,420
And then that way

2126
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:22,300
Yes, ma'am some aggro and then you

2127
02:23:23,020 --> 02:23:25,820
Shouldn't need to use your potion until we get to the boss fight

2128
02:23:27,260 --> 02:23:30,860
After the boss fight, I don't know what happens. We'll we'll try our best doesn't it?

2129
02:23:32,460 --> 02:23:34,460
Okay

2130
02:23:35,100 --> 02:23:39,660
Actual strategies actual strategies and a 10 year old game. Yes, real true

2131
02:23:41,020 --> 02:23:43,020
It's done you're old

2132
02:23:43,420 --> 02:23:45,420
I think uh since it it was like

2133
02:23:45,980 --> 02:23:47,980
2012

2134
02:23:47,980 --> 02:23:50,300
Okay, it's not even that old when I think about it

2135
02:23:53,660 --> 02:23:57,740
Okay, I'm spam. Are we good or someone got lightsaber

2136
02:24:02,300 --> 02:24:04,300
You're staying with scissors

2137
02:24:04,300 --> 02:24:10,460
Hey, if it's got high defense, so it's definitely yeah, that's best for me. Okay boss fight this time

2138
02:24:10,460 --> 02:24:13,500
We have a much better chance out at ease. I'm so over this guy

2139
02:24:14,620 --> 02:24:16,140
Actually

2140
02:24:17,100 --> 02:24:20,620
He goes straight for it. Never let me thought I think for a second

2141
02:24:22,380 --> 02:24:25,660
Okay, okay, I'll do 28 per hit that's good

2142
02:24:28,860 --> 02:24:30,860
28 per hit that's all I need

2143
02:24:33,260 --> 02:24:37,420
You can use your shield when he just throws those daggers you can use your shield. That's really

2144
02:24:37,420 --> 02:24:39,420
Like

2145
02:24:40,780 --> 02:24:47,020
I'm missing depth perception depth perception check roll for depth perception. I roll the one I roll the one

2146
02:24:47,820 --> 02:24:49,340
It's over

2147
02:24:49,340 --> 02:24:52,460
No shield the other way. Yeah, I have I have no depth perception either

2148
02:24:53,020 --> 02:24:59,100
I literally like I keep throwing my long range magic and it's like miss miss miss and I'm like, okay

2149
02:24:59,260 --> 02:25:03,980
I get it. I get it. Just can I have an auto lock then when I get to like level

2150
02:25:04,940 --> 02:25:09,660
No way I went I almost went down because of that. Well, where is he? Who's he going for?

2151
02:25:10,780 --> 02:25:12,780
Come on. Right. We're almost

2152
02:25:13,260 --> 02:25:18,060
Okay, yes, I have used a potion. That's fine. I don't know if I got lightsaber. I think I accident. Oh my god

2153
02:25:18,380 --> 02:25:20,380
Oh, you didn't notice you picked it up by accident

2154
02:25:21,740 --> 02:25:25,580
I don't know what it's like abilities are if it ups your strength or something

2155
02:25:26,380 --> 02:25:29,900
Is that his grave to the right? Are we about to put him in his own grave?

2156
02:25:34,220 --> 02:25:35,900
Oh

2157
02:25:35,900 --> 02:25:40,540
No, no, no, no. Is that a new move? Oh, he's going for pink. Jeez. He hates you

2158
02:25:41,020 --> 02:25:43,180
He's not gonna dump that on her. Oh, literally

2159
02:25:45,260 --> 02:25:47,660
He can smell the weak link. Oh, no

2160
02:25:50,300 --> 02:25:53,340
Oh, that was a big hit. I don't know who did that. Oh, no

2161
02:25:55,020 --> 02:25:57,020

We did it. We got the second princess

2172
02:26:38,060 --> 02:26:40,060
Wait, the gems are only worth one

2173

They don't let everyone heal up

2177
02:26:58,780 --> 02:27:00,780
At least make it fair. Jeez

2178
02:27:02,300 --> 02:27:06,780

That was strong

2196
02:28:29,340 --> 02:28:33,740
Without you getting stomped when we went to Pellum. So you took the aggro. That's

2197
02:28:34,380 --> 02:28:38,140
It's very important to take aggro to let your teammate you enabled us

2198
02:28:38,700 --> 02:28:44,860
For the dub you enabled us team work. Thanks the dream work. Oh my god, you guys. Thanks

2203
02:29:05,500 --> 02:29:09,820

2204
02:29:10,380 --> 02:29:12,700
And I was like, uh, yeah, no

2205
02:29:14,860 --> 02:29:20,220

02:31:44,860 --> 02:31:48,220
And again, I did not expect to enjoy that game so much

2240
02:31:49,660 --> 02:31:54,460
It was so good. I'm sorry. I've really really enjoyed that. I really enjoyed that

2247
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:21,900
Okay, I wonder what was that that game was surprisingly fun. Please don't be surprised if I make that stream snipe game

2248
02:32:22,460 --> 02:32:23,180
I

2249
02:32:23,180 --> 02:32:24,300
Thoroughly

2250
02:32:24,300 --> 02:32:25,980

Don't be a crew. No, it's my favorite part

2254
02:32:37,020 --> 02:32:40,540
That was so fun. I did not expect to enjoy that game. Uh, don't get me wrong

2255
02:32:40,540 --> 02:32:46,060
We were getting our ass beat but like once it started clicking and like obviously once you level up with the magic and stuff

2256
02:32:47,900 --> 02:32:53,740
Hmm, it was so good. How long did you sleep? Oh, I slept so long

2257
02:32:55,420 --> 02:33:01,740
I guess slept like six seven hours. I've been doing a few behind the scenes skills for the babies

2258
02:33:04,300 --> 02:33:06,300
Um

2259
02:33:06,460 --> 02:33:08,460

2262
02:33:23,340 --> 02:33:25,340
Oh, it's pink. She's not shut down our game yet

2263
02:33:28,540 --> 02:33:29,660
Um

2264
02:33:29,660 --> 02:33:32,300
Yeah, don't be surprised if this turns into a stream snipe thing

2265
02:33:33,020 --> 02:33:35,420
But you'd be playing the game off collab

2266
02:33:36,860 --> 02:33:40,460

2267
02:33:42,300 --> 02:33:48,780
Sin took the most op night, but miss killed someone. I mean that genuinely that was the first time all four of us have experienced that game

2268
02:33:48,860 --> 02:33:53,660
Uh, I don't ever recall mummy. I see you woke up early yesterday. Yeah

2269
02:33:56,140 --> 02:34:01,020
Oh, wait, no, I would have got seven hours if I didn't wake up early, but had to wake up early. So I got five hours

2270
02:34:02,060 --> 02:34:04,060
Yeah

2271
02:34:05,020 --> 02:34:11,740
What is the thing I can literally a mental block due to vivi brah I was like crying right in ASMR scripts

2272
02:34:12,540 --> 02:34:14,540
I was like

2273
02:34:14,620 --> 02:34:18,380
And then I put I brushed my fingers through your hair jet

2274
02:34:20,380 --> 02:34:22,380
Like that

2275
02:34:22,700 --> 02:34:24,700
dealing with it

2276
02:34:24,700 --> 02:34:26,460
um

2277
02:34:26,460 --> 02:34:28,460
I haven't watched vivi don't spoil it

2278
02:34:29,500 --> 02:34:31,500
You're feeling brave

2279
02:34:31,660 --> 02:34:33,660
Really

2280
02:34:33,900 --> 02:34:36,380
Uh, looks like he's just like sitting farm the wheel

2281
02:34:38,300 --> 02:34:40,300
My needle way

2282
02:34:41,180 --> 02:34:42,220
Um

2283
02:34:42,220 --> 02:34:47,100
Yeah, I did not expect to enjoy castle crashes that much. That's a a thoroughly fantastic game

2284
02:34:47,340 --> 02:34:48,780
I don't know if there's

2285
02:34:48,780 --> 02:34:53,660
If it's possible. I just I feel like peaches and pink. It's not their kind of game

2286
02:34:53,740 --> 02:34:55,900
So I wouldn't ask them to play it again. Um

2287
02:34:56,620 --> 02:35:02,220
But if we got two out of the four princesses, I mean technically we're already like 50 percent of the way there

2288
02:35:03,740 --> 02:35:09,900
All right, so I'm like covering up the gameplay. No, that there's much gameplay. I'm just rambling while doing stuff in game

2289
02:35:18,380 --> 02:35:20,380
But yeah, I'm not gonna I won't ask them to

2290
02:35:21,340 --> 02:35:23,340
play and

2291
02:35:23,660 --> 02:35:28,780
But this was really this was surprisingly a really nice find. Uh, I really thoroughly enjoyed that. I mean

2292
02:35:29,740 --> 02:35:32,220
The green brap night, bro. My farts are devious

2293
02:35:32,940 --> 02:35:34,940
absolutely devious

2294
02:35:34,940 --> 02:35:43,100
If there's a sudden influx of emotional strips, we'll know why he um she bees ASMR went up as well and acs if you haven't seen it yet

2295
02:35:44,860 --> 02:35:46,860
um

2296
02:35:48,460 --> 02:35:49,980
I

2297
02:35:49,980 --> 02:35:55,740
Well, I've got a membership stream after this. Uh, where I'm drawing your profile pictures, but I'm not sure

2298
02:35:57,820 --> 02:35:59,980
You didn't get the information what information?

2299
02:36:01,820 --> 02:36:05,820
Mommy's braps are worse than muster guests now steady on now steady on now

2300
02:36:06,940 --> 02:36:08,220
Um

2301
02:36:08,220 --> 02:36:09,900
But yeah

2302
02:36:09,900 --> 02:36:14,780
I don't know what the agendination is with the membership are used

2303
02:36:15,340 --> 02:36:18,620
So I wanted to do you know what fuck it will discuss it in the membership stream before

2304
02:36:18,940 --> 02:36:25,260
You know what? Um, I'm out of milk. I have terrible news about milk. So I can't do anything. Um, thank you again. She be in here

2305
02:36:25,260 --> 02:36:31,420
I'm for the rude. I'm going the need to redirect. Oh, she bees up on faith

2306
02:36:32,620 --> 02:36:36,940
Oh, I can return the favor. She's up on faith right now. Okay

2307
02:36:38,140 --> 02:36:42,940
Yeah, you got your deliveries as well. I got my collar. I got my lego set life is good

2308
02:36:43,260 --> 02:36:48,860
It's why I love this game a lot. You enjoy it alongside the lobo. It's so cute

2309
02:36:50,220 --> 02:36:52,540
Um, I thought I was sending that text

2310
02:36:54,540 --> 02:36:56,380
Center text real

2311
02:36:56,380 --> 02:37:01,580
Um, right what I'm going to do. I'm going to redirect into she be any sheepsters. Um

2312
02:37:05,340 --> 02:37:07,340
Oh, right, okay. Um

2313
02:37:07,900 --> 02:37:09,100
I'm

2314
02:37:09,100 --> 02:37:12,700
Preparing ink right now. Well, that's the file. This is a milk substitute, but literally I'm so sad

2315
02:37:12,700 --> 02:37:16,220
I was like, I can't even have my cup of tea in the morning. Absolutely shattered

2316
02:37:16,940 --> 02:37:21,420
My collar. Well, there's two collars. There's one with your name on it and one with my name on it, say

2317
02:37:23,100 --> 02:37:27,660
The question is who wants to be on the end of the league? That's terrible, bro

2318
02:37:28,860 --> 02:37:35,580
I was laughing my ass off when pink was like, that's too far and I was like, you're right. It's too far and I'm going to keep pushing it

2319
02:37:37,820 --> 02:37:44,620
Uh, um, as you can know, I'm surprised for us. Uh, peaches pink and sin very very good people

2320
02:37:45,100 --> 02:37:49,020
Love them. They're gorgeous. I kiss them. I make out with them

2321
02:37:50,060 --> 02:37:53,500
I do some other things with them. Maybe perhaps may have

2322
02:37:56,300 --> 02:38:00,860
For for mommy and it were the least for us. Okay. I am going to redirect into she be

2323
02:38:00,860 --> 02:38:04,620
I'm going to thank you so so much for watching the collab as always when it comes to collapse

2324
02:38:04,620 --> 02:38:08,540
I do apologize for the little chat interaction that there is

2325
02:38:09,180 --> 02:38:11,180
um, because

2326
02:38:12,860 --> 02:38:17,420
Um, you know how it is, you know how it be, but it was very nice to hang

2327
02:38:18,300 --> 02:38:20,300
with um

2328
02:38:20,700 --> 02:38:22,700
Some other creators, um

2329
02:38:22,940 --> 02:38:27,580
Obviously, I'm rather on the shy side of collabing. I've been pushing myself to do a few things

2330
02:38:28,300 --> 02:38:33,340
Um, I know you're probably your eyes are rolling out your skull at the thought of a valouring collab

2331
02:38:33,660 --> 02:38:35,660
But I thought

2332
02:38:35,660 --> 02:38:40,460
It would be nice to do to be taught how to play valourant by valourant players

2333
02:38:40,780 --> 02:38:43,340
But I was like, so what rank are you peaches and she was like

2334
02:38:44,460 --> 02:38:47,420
Uh, did she say bro? I think she said bronze and I was like

2335
02:38:48,380 --> 02:38:50,380
bronze

2336
02:38:51,900 --> 02:38:53,900
Who am I getting taught by

2337
02:38:54,540 --> 02:39:00,300
I love peaches so much. She's so cute. She said silver. I think she went silver in the past. I think she went bronze

2338
02:39:01,020 --> 02:39:07,740
Uh being that would actually be a really funny play learning learning valourant from bronze players

2339
02:39:07,820 --> 02:39:12,140
That would be so cute. Hold on doing a tweet right now. Hey, are you guys shit at valourant?

2340
02:39:12,220 --> 02:39:14,620
I'd like to collab with you. You're gonna teach me how to play

2341
02:39:16,540 --> 02:39:17,980
Um

2342
02:39:17,980 --> 02:39:22,620
I'll watch mommy play anything even if it's valourant even I get to do the discord

2343
02:39:23,740 --> 02:39:25,740
That a predator voicing

2344
02:39:27,660 --> 02:39:29,660
Then the mic

2345
02:39:30,620 --> 02:39:35,180
But yeah, no, I had so much fun on that game. Don't be surprised if there's a come stream snipe me of this

2346
02:39:35,740 --> 02:39:38,300
And it'll maybe be like I'll swap you though

2347
02:39:39,020 --> 02:39:41,580
I don't want to say every map the maps aren't really that big

2348
02:39:42,620 --> 02:39:48,460
I didn't realize how much progress we were making. We were like hauling ass like we got stuck at that one bit

2349
02:39:48,540 --> 02:39:51,020
But as soon as it started clicking we were off on one

2350
02:39:51,740 --> 02:39:53,740
um

2351
02:39:53,980 --> 02:39:57,180
Uh climbing and league and valourant is very different to overwatch out

2352
02:39:57,500 --> 02:40:02,380
To be honest when people say valourant or league for the meme, but don't really hate idea valourant eat it in stream

2353
02:40:02,460 --> 02:40:04,460
Yeah, I'm dating you right now

2354
02:40:05,580 --> 02:40:09,180
Oh my god, you go did they have play of the game in valourant?

2355
02:40:10,060 --> 02:40:12,060
What did what did they do in valourant?

2356
02:40:13,340 --> 02:40:18,460
What happens in there? I always got told it was like cs go and overwatch kissed

2357
02:40:19,180 --> 02:40:21,500
So I like is there play of the game in valourant or no?

2358
02:40:22,460 --> 02:40:28,620
There's a new dlc coming out for castle crashes. Yeah, apparently there was uh, oh my god

2359
02:40:30,140 --> 02:40:33,820
The failures I couldn't do it. Oh my god. Oh, they're players of lift

2360
02:40:34,620 --> 02:40:35,900
rip

2361
02:40:35,900 --> 02:40:40,940
It's like cs go webbillies. Okay via valourant is counter strike, but hero shooter

2362
02:40:43,100 --> 02:40:48,460
Good luck with the learning. No, I'll be like one stream and then that's a wrap it up one stream and then we'll wrap it up

2363
02:40:48,540 --> 02:40:55,100
I'm not fucking I turn in in a valourant streamer and turn in an overwatch streamer and turn in a league streamer wrap it up

2364
02:40:56,540 --> 02:40:58,540
Wrap it up

2365
02:40:58,620 --> 02:41:00,540
wrap it up

2366
02:41:00,540 --> 02:41:02,540
right now

2367
02:41:04,220 --> 02:41:06,220
Um

2368
02:41:06,220 --> 02:41:10,540
Did you see that balochro is coming to phones this month like the game?

2369
02:41:12,380 --> 02:41:15,820
The balochro person's been doing fantastic. I'm really happy. Well, I'm

2370
02:41:16,300 --> 02:41:20,700
I'm really happy for him. Um, just because like

2371
02:41:22,620 --> 02:41:25,420
Honestly, I would be such bra. I'm getting off my damn phone

2372
02:41:28,140 --> 02:41:33,980
You see that and then you get addicted. I think pink was a little bit disappointed that you ended stream so early so I

2373
02:41:35,420 --> 02:41:39,100
I never want to ask for more than two hours. Um

2374
02:41:41,580 --> 02:41:45,100
I do not want to ask for more than two hours and um

2375
02:41:46,780 --> 02:41:49,900
I think peaches was struggling to enjoy it, which is

2376
02:41:50,940 --> 02:41:55,100
Understandable. It was the first time and I didn't want to I don't want anyone to be miserable collabing with me

2377
02:41:55,100 --> 02:41:57,180
And I think this is you know, two and a half hours

2378
02:41:59,260 --> 02:42:00,620
Um

2379
02:42:00,620 --> 02:42:03,580
Concord stream when doesn't that game just die?

2380
02:42:04,300 --> 02:42:09,820
Is that bad? I'm genuinely excited for part two of overwatch. No, probably not. I just like being goofy. Okay

2381
02:42:09,900 --> 02:42:11,740
It's like being a goofy book

2382
02:42:11,740 --> 02:42:18,780
Right. My arse is gonna end redirecting to sheepsters and then give me five minutes and I'll prepare for my stream

2383
02:42:19,180 --> 02:42:21,180
Uh my membership stream

2384
02:42:21,580 --> 02:42:24,300
Uh, so yes t minus five minutes on a membership stream

2385
02:42:24,460 --> 02:42:30,140
And if not, I'll see you tomorrow because the agenda nation for tomorrow is drum roll

2386
02:42:30,540 --> 02:42:33,340
Wait to have a drum roll. Hold on. Have a drum roll

2387
02:42:34,700 --> 02:42:39,180
And it doesn't work, but of course it will. Uh, hold on. Hold on bear with me

2388
02:42:40,140 --> 02:42:43,500
AC's in the room bear with me. What's it called a stream deck?

2389
02:42:44,220 --> 02:42:46,220
Stream deck, please open

2390
02:42:47,100 --> 02:42:49,340
Uh drum roll tomorrow's agenda is

2391
02:42:55,260 --> 02:42:57,260
The ring fit and shower stream

2392
02:43:04,860 --> 02:43:06,300
Yay

2393
02:43:06,380 --> 02:43:09,500
Ring fit ASMR. I don't know how I'm gonna do that one

2394
02:43:10,460 --> 02:43:14,540
I have no idea how I'm going to exercise quietly and that ASMR mic

2395
02:43:14,860 --> 02:43:18,060
Uh, but we'll get we'll figure it out. Okay, we'll figure it out

2396
02:43:18,860 --> 02:43:24,140
Um, okay. Thank you so so much. I will see you tomorrow or I'll see you in five minutes. Either way, I'll see you

2397
02:43:25,020 --> 02:43:29,420
Maybe throw a window as well. I don't know it'll happen. Okay. I love you. Bye. I'm sorry

2398
02:43:31,020 --> 02:43:34,460
I'm a bit scatterbrained at the minute because I had to wake up rather rather early

2399
02:43:34,460 --> 02:43:40,460
And I didn't get my caffeine hit with my cup of tea shot behavior, but I see please say hi to she before me. Bye. Bye
