1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Mummy, the mummy hasn't abandoned no thing.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Mummy is in a foolish, foolish streamer.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
When I did the footstream, I put my ring light,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I had to move my ring light so I could,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
a little bit of shit and it would be done with the wall.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
As it eliminate that mummy started streaming on her hands and knees,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
it's not what she did.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, I need the ring light.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The thing that's happening is the goofy and it's jumping about everywhere.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Everyone, hold on.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh, but it's going to be light.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Please, it's going to be light.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Alright, my face is eliminated.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm also on reactive mode, so I'm actually going to react to the game.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Everyone knows I have an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080,

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
with 10,067 megabits.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hello, good morning.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let me put on live chat, any live chatter.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I apologize if I sound tired.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I passed out after that RuneScape stream,

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and I woke up 45 minutes ago.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I hope Icy's monetization stream went fantastic.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I believe Emmys is also today,

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
so if there's any pin pals or snowberries,

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
they're down the hall.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Into the lift.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I apologize if I sound tired.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I am exhausted.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't know how.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I slept for so long.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't know what earth is going on with me.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But I've got cup of tea, I've got two waters,

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I've got a wee muffin,

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and then we can jump into Crash Bandicoot.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
As for any updates, since I slept,

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I have absolutely nothing.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
A Riefling sent me a three page story,

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
which I really liked,

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
but for legal reasons,

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I cannot speak any of it here.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I've also put together a little folder of Bibbius,

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
which I don't know why I didn't think to do earlier.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But now, now I'm putting it all together.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh, and a Riefling sent me a five minute audio.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And he was like, talk, yeah.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I was like, oh my God,

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Rieflings are getting so brave, honestly.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And before I die a lot, probably,

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
probably, I'm not even going to put it behind me.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I don't know what level the desktop,

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
how loud the game's going to be compared to me,

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
but give me a three page story.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It was about me, obviously.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But yes, you guys have been doing fantastic.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I believe AC's doing well.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
There's, I don't really have any updates

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
about anything else at the moment.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Other than my freaking ASMR meme video,

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I've got 30 key views and I'm like, right,

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
this has definitely left the target audience,

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
because I had 5,000 subscribers when I posted that,

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and now we're at 6,000.

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm like, bro, that like propelled my channel.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So I'm waiting,

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Mercy's is going to go up after the stream

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
or, or it's going to go up after

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
she finishes her stream today.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And then AC's is ready to go up.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I may, actually, I'm going to message her

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
right now so she can reply to me.

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Now let's see, when you finished stream,

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
do you want me to upload your meme ASMR

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
on your behalf question mark?

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And before you're like, wait,

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
why are you asking the girls permission

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
to do stuff that you made for them?

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Because it's their channels.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't want them to be unhappy.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I want them to be happy little ducklings with me.

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Who up?

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Bandy their cooter.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Whoa.

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm getting a bit too close with that one.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Any Bandy girls.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's running such a sweetheart.

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes, I don't want to do anything that upsets the girls.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And if they're like, no,

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
now's not the time to upload the meme ASMR.

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I won't upload the meme ASMR.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's fine.

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So I'll get permission from them

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and then possibly after the stream.

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Apparently it takes eight hours to do this game.

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Now, I'm going to just say,

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I was a atom when I played this game.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I have barely any recollection.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
My dad didn't buy it for me.

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He bought it for himself.

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Johnny, congrats on 6.5K.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, I also made ASMR videos.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I was going to try and get my first thank you video out.

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Or maybe after a buckshot roulette after the doc.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Because I've got buckshot roulette.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Then I've got a couple of hours.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Then I go to the doctor.

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Is this a rhythm game?

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It is not.

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's Crash Bandicoot.

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It is an adventure platformer.

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I know you can't hear the background of the game right now.

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So it's just my voice in this room.

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Do forgive.

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Johnny, when in a gang?

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Any ganky desks?

118
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Hold on.

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let me hydrate with my tea.

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I owe so much ASMR.

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I do have it all recorded.

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I just need to sit and edit it.

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And I can't upload the clapping without

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
using my hands ASMR.

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yet.

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I need to have some things in between it.

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Strongly winning much in everything, right?

128
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's a never-ending move.

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Every time she releases an ASMR, she gains 1K

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and she gets to go back to square one.

131
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Honestly, I'm like, I hope not.

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I think it will definitely calm down a bit.

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's going to have to calm down.

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Because as much as our capitalist overlords

135
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
love infinite growth, that's just not plausible here.

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Is it something that is healthy or thingy?

137
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Because if you start measuring yourself by numbers

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and that kind of thing, that's when...

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I think that's when VTubers probably get it in their head.

140
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
They're like, oh, I'm not doing well enough.

141
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm not performing well enough.

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And it's like, brav.

143
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You haven't even given yourself a chance.

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Just have fun.

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
People can tell you're sweating on trends

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
if you're trying to sweat on trends, you know?

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And then people can tell when you're just memeing around

148
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
or you're just memeing around, you know?

149
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And guess what?

150
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Some streamers...

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Sorry, this is just turning into a philosophical...

152
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Let's digest and get to the roots of why streamers are streamers.

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Some people are just...

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What's the word?

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Optimised to have a nice, cosy, tight-knit community.

156
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Some people, some of your personalities, other streamers,

157
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
you're just supposed to have a nice little tight-knit community.

158
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're not supposed to be for the masses, you know?

159
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So don't always be reaching for the fricking stratosphere, the stars.

160
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't always be reaching for the stars when you do just fine in the stratosphere, you know?

161
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Every time you gain 1k, you release an ASMR that gains you 1k.

162
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's an infinite feedback loop you'll be at.

163
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Infinity subs by the end of the week.

164
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Not quite.

165
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Especially those looking to extract numbers from TikTok

166
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
that only have 100 subs but say they deserve a million views on every post.

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yes.

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I can actually get into the psychology on why people

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
feel they deserve subscribers

170
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
versus others who feel unworthy

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
of what they get because of what they've done.

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I could definitely go on an algorithm stream that in...

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Not tinfoil time!

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
No, it's not tinfoil! It's not tinfoil!

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's not tinfoil.

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's like actually, it's like human psychology

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
as well as the damage that the internet does to the mind.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Because if you didn't know, you're actually not supposed to be exposed to...

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I think you're not supposed to actually know more than 100 faces at once.

180
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And your brain is just not wired for any other way.

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
After that, your brain can only be wired to recognize tribes,

182
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
which sounds terrible, but that's just how it is.

183
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So it's like, ah, I am approaching the AC clan, you know?

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Or the tribe.

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Are you studying psychology?

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Absolutely not.

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I have had enough of education.

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm not...

189
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I say that I might be going back to beauty school,

190
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
but that's for...

191
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm talking like five years down the line beauty school type thing.

192
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Because I might want to run an ASMR room studio type thing.

193
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But that's just me.

194
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's just me.

195
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Neither tinfoil hat or more.

196
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Do the reeflings?

197
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Honestly, I'm so down for that.

198
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I need the meds to moat back.

199
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I need the thigh gripper moat back.

200
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
All other emotes that I need back.

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I was actually going to ask if a reefling has any batch to emotes,

202
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
wink, wink, if you could send me a cat box file of the batch itself.

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So I know what to reorder.

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Because I picked what I wanted.

205
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Just so you know.

206
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Just so we're all on the same...

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I picked what I wanted.

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh yeah, Crash Bandicoot 3.

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes, so I was bought an atom and my dad bought this game for himself.

210
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And the only thing I remember doing on this game is playing Coco on China

211
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and using the horse all the time.

212
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Eh, the horse?

213
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The tiger all the time.

214
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Eh, I'll have to catch stream later as I'm working on 80 slides of insurance termed out.

215
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Ooh!

216
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Even the thought of that is terrible.

217
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I don't know what's going on with my tees.

218
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I've not been enjoying them as of late.

219
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm getting a bit...

220
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm getting nervous.

221
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm getting a bit shaky why I'm not enjoying my tees.

222
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Because normally I'm all over them.

223
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Although I have been enjoying this fruit juice company thing

224
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
and they put loads of fruit in the juice

225
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and then they juice it

226
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and then I drink the juice

227
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and then I get all the goodness in me.

228
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah.

229
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I've had too many teas.

230
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This is a very plausible and realistic sense.

231
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Although I've only had one tea the day.

232
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I literally only...

233
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I woke up like...

234
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Well, I woke up an hour ago now.

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I woke up, spammed the PC on,

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
started spamming pre-chat for a few moments,

237
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
checked out AC to see what's going on with her.

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
She's fine.

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Checked out the Discord to see if the girls are fine.

240
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
They're fine.

241
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Refillings lacking flavour lately.

242
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You're not enjoying the tea because it's all just special, aren't you?

243
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh my god.

244
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It sounds terrible, but should I just get a cola?

245
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't think drinking a cola first thing in the morning

246
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
is a good idea, though.

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's a terrible idea.

248
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Okay, let's get into Crash Bandicoot.

249
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Any Crash Bandicooters?

250
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Is that too loud?

251
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Or is that fine?

252
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh my god.

253
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
How do I leave?

254
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Oh, my controller isn't even awake.

255
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Hold on.

256
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yeah, plug my controller in.

257
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So there's three games in it.

258
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I've only ever played Warped.

259
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't know what the other two are about.

260
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I guess the game.

261
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Override save.

262
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Is it too loud?

263
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Guys, groovy as anything.

264
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Maybe turn it down a little.

265
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Okay, I'll do it in the start menu after the cutscene.

266
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We're crashing?

267
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I guess we are called Crash Bandicoot.

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Thank you.

269
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Free at last.

270
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh my god, that's so beautiful.

271
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Oh, it kind of looks like a snowberry.

272
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Ooga, ooga is free.

273
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
No, it cannot be.

274
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Evil, great evil has come.

275
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Oh my god, this is so beautiful, this game.

276
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Bandicoot.

277
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Wait, it's a Tiki Mask, like Earth Tiki Mask.

278
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I know we've had a few unfortunate setbacks.

279
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Insane.

280
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Insane.

281
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Oh, I don't remember any of this.

282
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Fuck it.

283
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That was a flashbang first thing in the morning.

284
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Did you see that?

285
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I can't see anymore.

286
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Oh my god, this game is so beautiful and cool.

287
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
For real, I think I just got a virus.

288
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh, wait, wait, wait, I remember something like that.

289
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh my gosh, that was so beautiful.

290
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Wait, hold on.

291
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I need to turn down the volume a little bit.

292
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
My apologies.

293
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Game option, music 8.

294
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Wait.

295
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I could do this all day.

296
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
We'll do 8s.

297
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh my god.

298
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Oh wait, you can't control the camera angle.

299
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What does Y do?

300
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Y shows me my light, what does B do?

301
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
No.

302
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Oh my god, POV, I'm coming for AC.

303
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm a Snow Berry going for AC.

304
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh my god, on the prowl, on the prowl.

305
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Oh my god, this is so precious.

306
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
This is so cool.

307
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh my god, wait, I remember these symbols a little bit.

308
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Oh look, I have a mask helping me too.

309
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
No.

310
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'll find out which one is more powerful.

311
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Soon enough.

312
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I mean, it's more powerful because I'm the goodie.

313
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You're the baddie.

314
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Oh my god.

315
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Wait, where does this work?

316
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh my god.

317
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Oh my god, this is like, you can.

318
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh my god, we flints, we're already on the farm.

319
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
10 out of 10 game, we're already on the farm.

320
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Right, how do I do that?

321
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
To jump, to spin, to crouch for inventory.

322
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Why would I need to see my inventory?

323
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I guess if you're going for like 100%, but...

324
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Wee!

325
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Oh my god, we can bomb.

326
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
This game is beautiful.

327
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I remember that I don't need to hurt it.

328
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Oh no, we spanked the goat.

329
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Right, we spanked it.

330
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
We didn't kill it.

331
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
We spanked it away.

332
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Okay, it's fine.

333
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What's this?

334
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Oh my god.

335
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Oh my god.

336
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Oh no.

337
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Thank you for the 5.

338
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Okay, I can definitely take full damage.

339
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Oh my...

340
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Checkpoint!

341
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm remembering.

342
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Wait, go back on the farm.

343
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What does this do?

344
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Okay, if you hit it at a certain time.

345
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Oh my god, we're on the farm.

346
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Right, frogs.

347
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Frogs can hurt us.

348
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Go back on the farm, where you belong.

349
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Go ahead.

350
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh my god, I can spank everyone.

351
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh, I love this game.

352
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Wait, how about if I get 2 to go because...

353
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Oh, he's glowing.

354
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Oh, you are glowing.

355
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What the heck is it?

356
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What did I do?

357
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Where am I going?

358
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Oh no.

359
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What's this?

360
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Oh, it's bone.

361
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I got an achievement for doing this.

362
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's a bonus level.

363
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Wow, what?

364
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Bum bum bum.

365
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Bum bum bum.

366
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Is this just like free apples?

367
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh my apples.

368
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I never picked them up.

369
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh my god, that's so cool.

370
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Who found the dream?

371
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The bleeding hearts are getting spanked.

372
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
For real.

373
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
A wimpa fruit.

374
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
A wimpa fruit.

375
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
One puff fruit.

376
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Go back to the farm.

377
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh, we trick shot with it.

378
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The bleeding heart.

379
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
We trick shot it.

380
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Go back to the farm.

381
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
No frog for Gen 2.

382
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Uh...

383
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Oh my god, Sheebie really wants a slim girl for Gen 2.

384
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't know how to break it to her.

385
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
She really wants a Gen 2.

386
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm just like, maybe I'll give Sheebie a Halloween outfit.

387
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Wait, have we already been here before?

388
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Or is this just kind of the same layout?

389
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Okay, and it's spanked.

390
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What?

391
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Pink!

392
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Why is there a gap in this bridge?

393
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
We need someone who works with stone to fix the bridge.

394
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
We need someone who works with stone to fix the bridge.

395
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
No slim girl?

396
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
No, maybe I'll give Sheebie a slim Halloween outfit.

397
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
How about that?

398
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Slim girls.

399
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I get the...

400
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Oh, wait, so if you miss it, you'll...

401
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Okay!

402
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I missed a box!

403
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Stinky, I don't know where it was.

404
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Slim girls are my favorite monster girl.

405
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh, but slimes are hot.

406
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm not sure.

407
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I don't know.

408
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh, they came out of my earhole.

409
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Oops.

410
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And then we just go back in Ninja 2?

411
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Oh my gosh, that's cool.

412
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
This game is easy.

413
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I like how fun and easy it is.

414
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Lamia is all my favorite.

415
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I would entertain a Lamia.

416
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh, the fisher thing.

417
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
To kick fast.

418
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Whoa!

419
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Whoa! Okay, wait, that was very dumb.

420
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Sorry. That was incredibly dumb.

421
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Whoa!

422
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
This game is so pretty.

423
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Sorry.

424
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I've not got much accuracy under the war,

425
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
even though I'm a cuttlefish.

426
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I don't want to...

427
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That just like will pass them.

428
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Wait, that's a checkpoint.

429
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh my gosh!

430
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I remember something like this.

431
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I used to be so scared of it as a child.

432
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I thought I only remembered Coco.

433
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Oh!

434
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I can hear a box back there.

435
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Wait, what does that shark do?

436
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Please email him.

437
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Oh, there's a sand dollar.

438
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
On the ground.

439
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Wow, there's...

440
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Jeez, this game is so cute.

441
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I can't believe I didn't play this before.

442
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Well, I mean...

443
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Sorry, I got scared.

444
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I don't know if I can hurt those pufferfish.

445
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Checkpoint.

446
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Why checkpoint?

447
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What's here that shouldn't be here?

448
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Is there something below that's going to kill me?

449
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Because why did I get a checkpoint?

450
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You can switch to play Coco!

451
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Oh!

452
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Oh my gosh!

453
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
What? I don't wonder this game did so good.

454
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's like so creative.

455
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Oh, there is hidden boxes under the coral reef!

456
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That's okay.

457
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
We're not going for 100%

458
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
because I don't know how to 100% this game.

459
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But we can go for lots of fruit.

460
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Okay, yummy yummy fruit.

461
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Oh, I can beat shark up in this.

462
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And I can explode things in this.

463
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Let's go.

464
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Oh no, I broke it.

465
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm sorry.

466
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm a bit of a klutz. I accidentally broke it.

467
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Dun dun dun.

468
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh wait, that's not the song anymore.

469
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's whatever the underwater.

470
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Sure, we'll get these boxes.

471
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I think it's safe for now.

472
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Oh my god.

473
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What do you mean I'm so in love with a game

474
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
that's got the difficulty for literal children?

475
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I can't believe it.

476
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
The accusations are unfounded.

477
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I play Skyrim on Legendary mode just because you can.

478
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It doesn't mean you need to be...

479
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Wait, can I hurt this?

480
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Oh no, I can beat up the little puffer fish.

481
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Oh, the purple puffers.

482
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Okay, there we go.

483
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Well, there's the prank crystal.

484
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Okay, let's get it.

485
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Wait, is that going to explode?

486
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh wow!

487
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
If you don't do it in time, it becomes a solid.

488
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Okay, that's curious.

489
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Is it hard to get 100%?

490
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Oh, I missed a lot of boxes this time.

491
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Didn't do that good this time.

492
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
That's okay.

493
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm happy just loving everything.

494
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
The scene remains me so much of Jack and Dax though.

495
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Jack and Dax.

496
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Oh, I threw that one up this time.

497
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So it doesn't always come out your ear.

498
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Wee!

499
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
The Orion Express.

500
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Coco!

501
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Oh, this is the mission!

502
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Oh my god, this is the mission!

503
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Ah!

504
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Coco!

505
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And what's the tiger's name?

506
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Oh my god!

507
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh my god!

508
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Oh my god!

509
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I know it's like first thing in the morning,

510
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
but I'm so happy!

511
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Oh my god, this is the mission that I always

512
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
remember from childhood.

513
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Oh my god, go Coco!

514
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Go Coco!

515
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You did it!

516
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You're so beautiful!

517
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Oh my god, it's the music!

518
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Ah!

519
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

520
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Oh my god, get it, get it, get it!

521
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Yes!

522
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Oh no, I hurt myself.

523
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I didn't know what I was supposed to do there.

524
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I forgot, but I got a checkpoint.

525
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Oh, I jumped into it!

526
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Coco, no!

527
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Oh, but it's okay.

528
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
The tiger forgives me for being a terrible driver.

529
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Oh, I did it again!

530
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Oh shit, stop jumping!

531
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Stop jumping!

532
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Okay, no more jumping.

533
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
No jumpies, jumpies now.

534
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
But no jumpies.

535
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And then big boy jumpies!

536
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Oh, I missed!

537
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
What the heck, I was so close!

538
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Oh, if I run ahead, I can attack.

539
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Wee!

540
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Rawr!

541
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Tiger!

542
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Ah, how can you...

543
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Oh no!

544
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It's so bad!

545
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Oh my god!

546
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Wait, what happens if I run out of lives?

547
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Is it over?

548
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Is it over for me?

549
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
This is over for Mesh.

550
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Wait, can I just run ahead and hurt them?

551
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Wee!

552
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Rawr, there was a freaking leap in a half!

553
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Call me Jewel Leeper,

554
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
because one tiger run is all it takes.

555
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Wee!

556
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Oh my god!

557
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
This is such a good machine!

558
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Oh, my little tiger!

559
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Soft kitty, warm kitty,

560
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
little ball of fluff.

561
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Oh, that's the best mission

562
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
in the entire game.

563
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Okay, we can end stream them.

564
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
That's all we needed to do.

565
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Wee!

566
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
That's all we needed to do.

567
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Oh!

568
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I don't know what the diamond is.

569
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Right, what we got next?

570
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The Boneyard!

571
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
There are like three more of that?

572
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Oh my god!

573
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
What?

574
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Oh no!

575
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Neurons activated from childhood.

576
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Oh no!

577
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I think I get chased

578
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
this entire mission!

579
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Oh no!

580
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Oh no!

581
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
There's lava everywhere!

582
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It's jumping faster!

583
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Oh, I don't know, I'm jumping faster!

584
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Oh my god!

585
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Why did you do that? Crash!

586
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Crash, why did you do that?

587
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Crash, jump! Crash!

588
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Crash, you need to jump!

589
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Like, double jump!

590
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Whoa, wait, I can't do it!

591
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Wait, can I just stay here forever

592
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
in the tower?

593
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Is that a Tyrannosaurus talk or something like that?

594
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Wait, why can I not jump that?

595
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Can you double jump it again?

596
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Is it...

597
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Oh, is it that? Jump, spin?

598
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Whoa, I could hardly get over that!

599
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Oh no!

600
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I can't believe it, childhood

601
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
me strikes again.

602
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Can I not double jump?

603
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Hold the jump!

604
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Hold the jump?

605
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
What the heck? I'm not going to make it!

606
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I'm going to run out of lava!

607
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Oh no!

608
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Wait!

609
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Wait, it's not doing anything!

610
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Hold on, let's practice.

611
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Jump, jump, jump, jump!

612
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Jump, uh!

613
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Uh, uh, uh!

614
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Ah!

615
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I don't know how to double jump!

616
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Uh, uh, uh!

617
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Uh, uh, uh!

618
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
It's not letting me double jump!

619
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Oh, it is letting me double jump!

620
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Wait, but I jumped right into it!

621
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Oh my god!

622
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It's so over and the stream

623
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
hasn't even freaking started!

624
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I can't figure it double jump!

625
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Is my input wrong?

626
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm holding A on my controller.

627
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
There is no double jump.

628
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Uh, uh!

629
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I'm getting so confused.

630
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Is this a child's game or not?

631
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Answer me!

632
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Is this game for kids to complete or not?

633
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It's not looking good.

634
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Can't even get through the first freaking jump!

635
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Woo!

636
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Hey!

637
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Dash jump is one way.

638
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Is for kids.

639
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I'm getting filtered by level 3.

640
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I actually am!

641
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I don't know how to go through this.

642
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Level 3, I actually am!

643
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I don't know how to do it!

644
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm, like, trying to extend the jump.

645
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But there's nothing to extend it.

646
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It's just a straight magma jump!

647
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Woo!

648
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You unlock double jump after beating a boss.

649
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Wait, so leave and then go to see a boss

650
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and come back?

651
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Are you holding your jump button

652
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
down instead of tapping?

653
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
If I tap, hold,

654
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
tap.

655
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Holding, tapping.

656
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Right, hold A.

657
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Holding A!

658
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Fuck!

659
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Holding A!

660
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
This is me holding A!

661
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Okay.

662
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It just seems to be, like, so tiny and

663
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
slate.

664
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Like, minuscule.

665
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Woo!

666
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Right, this is the furthest I've ever got.

667
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Don't mess up now.

668
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Okay.

669
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I need a breather, honestly.

670
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Right, I'm just going to keep going.

671
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Oh my god!

672
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Why is that so hard?

673
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Oh, that's TNT!

674
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Wee!

675
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
That's more TNT!

676
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
They explode!

677
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Okay, we did it.

678
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Oh, gee willikers, I sure hope we don't have to do

679
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
that segment again, because, uh,

680
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
what the heck? Why is that so hard?

681
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I literally have no double jump open.

682
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You should try jumping over them.

683
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Taming matters.

684
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
What's this?

685
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Oh, a platform?

686
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I don't have access to it.

687
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Golly, you scared me.

688
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Oh my god, it's discord nature!

689
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Is this...

690
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
What does that do?

691
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Okay, well,

692
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I remember what it does now.

693
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Wait, can I do this?

694
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Oh.

695
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Go away, you're so creepy!

696
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
What are you?

697
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Oh, bonus time, bonus time!

698
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
That's what it does.

699
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Yeah.

700
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Don't touch the nature.

701
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
No discord daddies.

702
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Or no discord groomers in the velar.

703
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Good luck.

704
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Wow.

705
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Bence?

706
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Bounce?

707
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Oh my god, I get free life.

708
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Well, I definitely needed that after how...

709
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Oh!

710
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
He just scooted.

711
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Why is he so slow when he crouches though?

712
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Okay, I like the bonus distance.

713
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Where's the key?

714
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Try to tap crouch

715
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
when walking to get faster.

716
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Tap crouch while walking.

717
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Oh, every hundred apples,

718
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I get a life.

719
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Ah, those things are so scary.

720
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
For a duke.

721
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Exclamation mark.

722
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
What the heck did I just do?

723
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Oh no, I was supposed to jump.

724
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I missed the jump.

725
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Oopsies, I was supposed to jump on top of them.

726
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Oh good.

727
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I don't like this camera angle.

728
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
No, this is why I didn't like the camera angle.

729
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It felt like I was going to get chased again.

730
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Okay, give me the checkpoint at least.

731
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Oh, there's...

732
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Gate the way up.

733
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Oh no!

734
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
What was that?

735
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Crash?

736
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Did you just stand on lava and let me win?

737
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Oh my god, the game feels so bad for me.

738
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
That is letting me win.

739
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It feels so bad for me.

740
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Please don't slow me down.

741
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Oh my god, get me out of here.

742
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Oh, get me out of here.

743
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I'm not playing this level again.

744
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Wampa Fruits, they're wampas.

745
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Oh my god, the game felt so bad

746
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
it let me walk on lava.

747
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Oh, that came up more.

748
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Honestly, me right now.

749
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Did I do four there?

750
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Yes, I did. Right, we're not playing that one again.

751
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
That one was stinky. We're doing five.

752
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
We're doing...

753
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Oh, Coco!

754
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
What's this one?

755
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It's me.

756
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Eh?

757
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
To accelerate, right trigger.

758
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
There's no backwards.

759
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Oh my god, it's so wobbly, wobbly.

760
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Whee!

761
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Jump shot.

762
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Wah!

763
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Yoo-hoo!

764
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Oh my god, this is...

765
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Oh, there's a bomba.

766
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Wait, wait, let me get the bomb.

767
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Oh, 360.

768
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
That's okay. 360!

769
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
She's actually doing spins.

770
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm not doing any input for her

771
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
to do those spins, by the way.

772
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm just jumping on it.

773
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Oh, there's bombas!

774
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Bomba!

775
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Oh no, I've only got seven lives.

776
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Oh well, I just regained a new one.

777
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Okay.

778
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
This is a child's game. Children can play this.

779
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So I can play this.

780
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm wise enough to play a child's game.

781
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Surely.

782
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Surely I won't have to run out of lives.

783
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
If I play at the same level

784
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
over and over,

785
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Dad just gets infinite lives.

786
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Because we might have to farm lives

787
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
unironically.

788
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Right, hold on. What's going on here?

789
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
No. Yes.

790
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Yes. Okay, we made it and we're going to get this checkpoint.

791
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Wah!

792
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Eh, excuse me.

793
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I said we're going to get this checkpoint.

794
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Oh my god.

795
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It's edging me right now.

796
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Wah!

797
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Oh, that was close. That was close.

798
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I was a bit too close for comfort.

799
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

800
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Timon's going to be fine. It's fine.

801
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Oh, there's a seagull!

802
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

803
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Slow it down. Slow it down.

804
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Slow and steady.

805
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
When's the race?

806
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Then you need to go 100 miles per minute.

807
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Wah!

808
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Honestly.

809
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Good game.

810
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I am going to drop into the bomb.

811
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
But I didn't because I'm so

812
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
emotional at this child's game.

813
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Wah!

814
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Oh, there's two bombs. That's cheeky.

815
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
The devs did that for a reason.

816
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
They knew I was going to be greedy

817
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
and go for the bomba.

818
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

819
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Hello?

820
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Okay. Holy crap.

821
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I was like, can I even go near that

822
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
wall?

823
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Steady, easy, easy.

824
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Take it easy.

825
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Steady.

826
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I'd say someone steady when's the race.

827
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
But sometimes, sometimes you got to

828
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
just send it and get out of here.

829
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Oh my god.

830
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Oh, this is so good.

831
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Who suggested this game?

832
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Congrats on you if you suggested it.

833
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Just kidding. I picked it

834
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
because it's a childhood game.

835
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Okay.

836
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Okay.

837
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
The boss fight.

838
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Oh, no.

839
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Tiny Tiger.

840
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Oh, no.

841
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I'm not going to get perished by a boss.

842
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Crash.

843
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Crash.

844
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Sometimes he has...

845
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Oh, no.

846
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Oh, the music is banging, though.

847
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Oh!

848
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Oh, no.

849
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
MonkaS?

850
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
MonkaS? What'd I do?

851
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
MonkaS, MonkaS, MonkaS, MonkaS.

852
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Ah!

853
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Please leave me alone.

854
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Oh my god, he's got J's on like me.

855
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Spank.

856
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Okay. It's fine.

857
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
One and three.

858
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
What does that mean?

859
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
What does that mean?

860
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
There's Tigers!

861
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I'm to avoid...

862
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
everything?

863
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
What?

864
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm to avoid all those Tigers?

865
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Spank

866
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And then Tigers, right? We can do this.

867
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
We can do this.

868
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Okay. Take your time.

869
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Uh-huh.

870
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Uh-huh.

871
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

872
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.

873
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Okay. Okay. I just got a little caught up in this.

874
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
The last one.

875
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Okay. Just keep running.

876
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Just keep running. Just keep running.

877
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Just keep running. Spank!

878
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And then we do it all over again.

879
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Okay.

880
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

881
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Let's go. This is so much faster

882
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
than the second phase.

883
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
But that's okay!

884
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Okay.

885
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Okay. Okay. Okay. Just keep running.

886
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Just keep running around.

887
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
He'll come to me.

888
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
We did it. We're doing it. We're doing it.

889
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
We're doing it. We're doing it.

890
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Spank! Oh, we did it!

891
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
What did we get?

892
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
What is this?

893
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Boo! Tomato! Tomato!

894
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Boo!

895
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Beat him while he's down! Beat him while he's down!

896
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Argh!

897
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Take this.

898
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Okay. What is this?

899
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Supercharged body slam

900
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
for a more professional belly flop.

901
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Press A and B

902
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
to the top of the jump.

903
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Please! I love this so much!

904
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Oh, that's so good.

905
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I love it.

906
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Momay domination.

907
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Dang straight.

908
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Dang straight!

909
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Well done, children.

910
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
By defeating Tiny,

911
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
you have unlocked the gate to the next time travel area.

912
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Go back to the center of this time, Trister,

913
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
and save your progress if you wish.

914
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
From there, you will see

915
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
that the gate to the second time travel area

916
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
is now open.

917
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Okay. Thank you.

918
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Okay.

919
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Okay, so I've unlocked everything in this one.

920
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
In the castle segment.

921
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
How do I save the game?

922
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Left trigger, save.

923
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Uh, sure.

924
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Oh, auto-save is already active.

925
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
That's fine.

926
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Yeah, just save that though.

927
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Yeah, okay.

928
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Just in case.

929
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
What is this?

930
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So we've got Arabia,

931
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
China,

932
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Egypt,

933
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
the future,

934
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
South Korea then,

935
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
for the future.

936
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Are you squidding me right now?

937
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Tiny, Spiny!

938
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I would just like to formally say that I,

939
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Tiny, Spiny, am not associated with

940
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Tiny, Tiny in any way,

941
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
and do not endorse his actions.

942
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
No.

943
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Way to go with the game so far.

944
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
It's going so good.

945
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I love it.

946
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Thank you for the five gifted memberships.

947
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Congrats to those who caught it with your face.

948
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
It means you get access to the moots.

949
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm going to very quickly grab a can of cola.

950
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I'll be literally in those seconds

951
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
because I couldn't finish my tea,

952
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
so I'll just get cola.

953
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Surely we can't be no weak to me at all.

954
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Sure.

955
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
My question,

956
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
briefly,

957
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
is surely not all commissions are that short

958
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
because there's only five locations.

959
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And if there's only five locations,

960
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I don't...

961
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I think they were going to be finished with Game in two hours

962
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
and redirect him into Sheevie

963
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
because there's no way.

964
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Thank you for the gifted membership

965
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
for Jinger, and thank you for

966
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
the tip, Tiny, Spiny,

967
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
if.

968
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
They're short, but you'll die a lot.

969
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
What happens if I get zero lives?

970
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Like, I genuinely lose?

971
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
This is called

972
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
G-Wiz

973
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and...

974
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It deletes your save file?

975
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Am I being trolled right now?

976
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Or did I genuinely lose all progress?

977
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Because this is an old game

978
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
and that's exactly what old games did.

979
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
They make you lose your...

980
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Whoa.

981
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Go back to the farm!

982
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Go back to the farm!

983
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Back to the farm!

984
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Back to the farm!

985
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Oh!

986
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Barely float!

987
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Ah!

988
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Okay.

989
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Oh!

990
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Ah!

991
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

992
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
The way I absolutely

993
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
decimated that poor man.

994
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It's not that old.

995
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
You just lose your score and start from your latest level.

996
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Oh!

997
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
A game over. The player is given the option to either restart the game

998
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
from the beginning of the level.

999
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:54,680
kind of with the standard number of lives for or to quit to the title screen okay so I don't lose

1000
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:01,080
all my progress that's good because if I lost all my progress we're actually going to play a game

1001
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:08,280
called conquers bad fur day but conquers bad fur day is so old that you oh my god I like got a

1002
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:19,480
trick shot there and it's so old that you lose your progress if you mess up and so I'm gonna try

1003
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:25,320
and win conquers bad fur day but I actually have terrible news I don't know if I can win it go back

I don't really want to set it all

1372
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:39,320
I thought I had enough distance to do that okay I won't do that again I'll leave the TNT as is

1373
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:42,200
I don't need anything from the TNT

1374
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:47,640

1375
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:56,920

1376
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:58,040

okay we can do special mission

1383
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:44,920
her disdain for mages it's because they have an auto lock

1474
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:22,600
ending where you win this crash bandicoot the game was like that but I've

1475
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:33,000
vomit up there was this enemy Dr. Entropy isn't Entropy when you're

1476
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:43,040
like skinny I'm I think it's not in our way too stupid to understand what you're

1477
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:48,600
getting yourself into this time you've done it

1478
01:44:51,600 --> 01:45:03,040
Entropy there's usually a special hundred percent completion and then jump what

1479
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:10,360
does that mean what does that mean what does it mean I don't know

1480
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:13,920

1484
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:50,880
struggle with the next boss fight but I think this is lovely like this is this

1485
01:45:50,880 --> 01:46:05,200

1486
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:13,160
spoke far too soon I admit it I confess to my sin right let's try that again

1487
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:21,000
okay let's try that again I never made it this far into the game as a child I

1488
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:31,920
don't think I did either because I am I don't recall anything past Coco I just

1489
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:45,040
think that only remember Coco okay okay okay right this time don't let the

1490

1496
01:47:56,920 --> 01:48:01,560
entropy's constant care and control and she's trying to what it will do and she's

1497
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:08,760
trying to guilt truck was into losing who knows what it'll do oh no right we're

You, and then a mummy, okay, that's fine, return the slime, watching you play this makes me

1508
01:49:31,420 --> 01:49:38,540
want to get a spiral, I've never played spiral but people were recommending it and I was like

1509
01:49:38,540 --> 01:49:44,940
I might give it a shot, give me checkpoint please but let the doors close first because I was 100%

1510
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:59,820
gonna fall for that, hold on, I want the spikes up, okay, all right I'm safe to go on it for the

1511
01:49:59,820 --> 01:50:12,380
section which is fine, that sarcophagus is making some, you're scaring me, I like how it

1515
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:48,540
kind of closely the same time, right what did I do wrong here again, I had nothing to protect me,

1516
01:50:51,260 --> 01:50:55,100
I'm wondering if I have more time if I do that, oh wow I do, right,

1517
01:50:57,500 --> 01:51:03,420
and let me guess that doesn't explode the T, oh no it does, I was gonna be like oh let me guess it

01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:17,420
doesn't do anything, again, oh no, oh we're struggling with this one,

1519
01:51:20,940 --> 01:51:27,420
goodness gravy, am I making this look easy, no sorry am I making this look hard,

1520
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:36,300
right and then wait for it to come back and then jump on it and then defeat the mummy twice

1521
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:48,780
or the sarcophagi, jeez, let's try this again, right and then I can just double jump here

1522
01:51:48,780 --> 01:51:54,700
because I'm out of range and then he's gonna drop that which explodes that one first just fine with

1523
01:51:54,700 --> 01:52:06,060
me, right don't send it, don't send it reflings, if you ever replay this game don't send it at

1524
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:11,020
that section because that's what I thought I had to do there and it did not pay off, I need to wait

1525
01:52:11,020 --> 01:52:17,820
until he spawns the second blow, we'll get there it just takes me a few moments, can't believe it

1526
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:25,740
they made me flat, the lollipop model confirmed first Ronnie, right again just jump over this

1527
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:31,260
which is fine, oh there's not even TNT this time the game said yeah you're struggling, right send it

1528
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:36,780
send it send it send it right and you would work if I sent it, oh I've got a checkpoint goodness

1529
01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:45,420
that'll be very welcomed I assure you, there's really enemies behind this, yeah there's freaking

1530
01:52:45,420 --> 01:53:05,980
TNT, oh take your time, take your time, there will be a mummy, okay we're good, we're good, we're

1531
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:14,860
doing it, we're doing it, we are doing it, oh why would they randomly have a natural there

1532
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:24,220
oh oh send it send it send it send it, I like how he just looks at me as if I'm not about to

1533
01:53:24,220 --> 01:53:41,820
kablamo him, uh this seems suspiciously easy, rather this is suspiciously, oh wait hold on, oh

1534
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:51,100
crystal let's go on the bonus map, don't send it no idea I'm literally giving you the strats live

1535
01:53:51,100 --> 01:53:59,580
because uh I'm struggling, okay there's lots of TNT, I'll just let it pop and then run away again

1536
01:53:59,580 --> 01:54:10,380
what oh there's too many oh dear

1537
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:17,580
there's lots of freaking

1538
01:54:18,460 --> 01:54:28,700
oh well that's the best I can do, the best I can do is what I've got,

1539
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:39,980
cuckoos don't look at the explosion because she's so cool, I start off a guy, oh I'm just a

1540
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:50,780
bit rude of me but uh I did the job, oh there's like monkeys in these pots, sling your shit elsewhere

1544
01:55:29,580 --> 01:55:35,740
I don't go back, there's a message in the discord, I need to be worried

1569
01:58:52,700 --> 01:59:00,860

1576
01:59:44,460 --> 01:59:50,380
it was like bear the first time you played this map, the bombs were moving, there's like enemies

1604
02:03:31,660 --> 02:03:38,460
announced and I agree, I would want some sort of remaster or get the same dev team in because

1605
02:03:38,460 --> 02:03:50,140
we were so precious, go away, oh sugar, let's try that again, go away, wow what, yeah that's

1606
02:03:50,140 --> 02:03:57,980
exactly what I thought was gonna happen Coco and I was forced to do that stinky game, that guy's red

1607
02:03:57,980 --> 02:04:08,380
and go green, I think, go away, oh

oh I'm to fly, oh right, oh sorry I thought that was gonna explode, wait we'll do the bonus level

1609
02:04:22,060 --> 02:04:27,500
I thought that was gonna explode the moment I came near it, okay we're safe, oh no the game's

1610
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:33,820
telling me to like double triple quadruple jumps and stuff, wait well double jump and then

okay and we got an extra life, double jump, right we're not doing bonus levels anymore

1613
02:04:51,500 --> 02:04:56,780
if there's a chance that I can perish in them, I will not stand for such slander, thank you

1614
02:04:56,780 --> 02:05:01,420
Vajingo for the five gifted members, shit, and congrats to those who caught it, enjoy the emotes

02:05:08,300 --> 02:05:10,380
I'll just cross, I have um

1617
02:05:12,380 --> 02:05:17,820
10 emotes, the girls are getting their batch of 10 before me because the emotes artist

1618
02:05:18,620 --> 02:05:23,500
is gonna take a month to do them and I'm crying internally when she told me that because

1619
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:29,420
ouch why a month, it hurts, and they increased the price as well, it sucks even more

1620
02:05:30,220 --> 02:05:35,020
because I like when emotes all look the same, like where it's clearly, what the heck am I supposed to do

1621
02:05:36,060 --> 02:05:39,020
oh wait was that on note to spam eh?

1622
02:05:42,140 --> 02:05:44,140

1625
02:05:51,020 --> 02:05:53,020
you don't lose lives in bonus levels though, eh

1626
02:05:56,540 --> 02:06:03,020
what am I supposed to do, yeah that's exactly what I just tried to do but it didn't like it, oh sorry I'm like

1627
02:06:03,020 --> 02:06:05,580
hanging all these away, so go up and then

1628
02:06:06,700 --> 02:06:13,100
Coco, Coco, Coco Chanel, I'm gonna start, I need a word with your manager because what's going on here Coco

1636
02:06:56,780 --> 02:07:03,580
right so you do it that way, so go and do it that way then, Coco, oh my god why are you not doing it that way

1637
02:07:03,660 --> 02:07:13,980
why are you not doing it that way, why are you not doing it that way, you did it the other way, so why won't you do it that way

1638
02:07:22,540 --> 02:07:28,700

1644
02:08:03,020 --> 02:08:08,860
you know what, you know what, see this game I have to go do that section all over again

1645
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:15,180
because they put a freaking spike over that jump, oh and I've just lost my wee ugabugamask

02:08:15,740 --> 02:08:19,740
bruv, bruv I'm getting ruled

1744
02:21:23,740 --> 02:21:29,820
when I was playing this I'm just a bastard bandicoot with a rocket launcher I thought of that mean

I'm freaking loving this game oh my gosh it's like so well put together other than the recent ones

1760
02:23:25,980 --> 02:23:27,660
but because I'm dumb and couldn't figure out

1761
02:23:33,100 --> 02:23:40,460
thank you for coming on member and lord of strums again for the gifted membership me and the reeflings

1762
02:23:43,500 --> 02:23:46,220
just as I was complaining about a race in the mission

1763
02:23:51,820 --> 02:23:53,180
it's the last one though

1764
02:23:56,220 --> 02:24:00,060
it's the last race in mission surely

1765
02:24:03,820 --> 02:24:07,660
surely two and then go right I got the boost

1766
02:24:11,020 --> 02:24:18,060
the police are doing nothing other oh I never even saw that oh my god I need my glasses on so badly

1767
02:24:20,300 --> 02:24:22,620
we'd just still love me as a streamer if I never put my

1768
02:24:26,940 --> 02:24:34,860
I'm trying to hold it together I'm trying to hold it together I'm at the absurdity that is these maps

1769
02:24:36,220 --> 02:24:39,420
for racing I'm literally seventh place there's no way

1770
02:24:43,420 --> 02:24:47,660
I there's no way I've got this I refuse yeah get in my way Yabu

1771
02:24:47,900 --> 02:24:55,900
okay everyone's using the ramp which is fine I'll use it too okay you're gonna have to use

1772
02:24:55,900 --> 02:25:05,020
the ramp because of the bro these AI police cars bro you can't even reverse in this game

1773
02:25:09,020 --> 02:25:12,460
the reeflings I'm gonna have to send my game file to one of you right now

1774
02:25:13,180 --> 02:25:16,860
and then you send me it back complete and I'll do the other missions while I'm at it

1775
02:25:16,860 --> 02:25:23,980
because this is ridiculous uh why did they make the freaking driving one so hard

1776
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:31,740
and crash if you didn't stop skating everywhere across the map we're actually gonna have issues

1777
02:25:34,380 --> 02:25:38,220
out my road okay well that was terrible please don't ever do that again

1778
02:25:39,100 --> 02:25:42,220
I'm fifth place oh and I missed it

1779
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:48,620
okay the AI can actually go off road which is interesting I didn't know that

1780
02:25:49,740 --> 02:25:57,420
the AI is adapting and I'm getting nervous why are they oh and I missed it again

1781
02:25:59,260 --> 02:26:05,100
I'm fourth place honestly that wasn't awful I'm wondering right we'll keep doing it we'll

1782
02:26:05,100 --> 02:26:08,620
keep doing it we'll keep doing it that was the first time I played the map and the first thing

1783
02:26:08,620 --> 02:26:16,540
I did was fall off okay reeflings are always thrilled to princess carry me honestly I just wish

1784
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:24,940
I just I just I'm getting filtered by a child game three two and then hold boost okay and then

1785
02:26:24,940 --> 02:26:32,700
on the left side there is already an issue so the AI is actually choosing to go off the map

1786
02:26:32,780 --> 02:26:38,140
which is curious I didn't think the AI did such a thing

1787
02:26:40,460 --> 02:26:45,180
very curious indeed yeah they're all avoid in the polis

1788
02:26:47,740 --> 02:26:53,420
so just take it easy these corners didn't do so yeah I didn't do so hot in these corners

1789
02:26:54,060 --> 02:27:01,180
wow I'll take that boost though I'll take that boost thank you

1790
02:27:02,700 --> 02:27:06,620
I have to take this ramp because there is a gap you will not make it

1791
02:27:07,180 --> 02:27:15,340
go minasori you will not make it if you take that gap it's okay no fender bender fender bender

1792
02:27:16,060 --> 02:27:22,380
that's illegal you have to stop and call the police oh fuck this

1793
02:27:26,220 --> 02:27:32,620
okay hold on can you fender bender elsewhere please elsewhere okay

1794
02:27:32,620 --> 02:27:39,900
okay

1795
02:27:45,020 --> 02:27:50,540
I'm trying reeflings I'm actually trying so hard right now I'm sweating my my cheeks off

1796
02:27:50,540 --> 02:27:54,860
I say I'm sweating my panties off but you all know what's happening with that oh I might do it

1797
02:27:55,660 --> 02:27:59,180
oh my god I might do it oh my god just don't just don't

1798
02:28:05,260 --> 02:28:08,860

02:28:10,460 --> 02:28:18,380
oh oh my god I did it in two oh thank god thank god oh my god that was so freaking hard

1800
02:28:18,460 --> 02:28:26,540
literally maximum mouth breathing all all wrinkly parts of my brain were locked in

1801
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:34,300

I think the camera angles I would at first I actually didn't like that I couldn't control

1832
02:31:42,060 --> 02:31:49,420
that camera angle but now I'm like I get it now this is actually pretty pretty nice this is pretty

1833
02:31:50,220 --> 02:31:51,260
rewarding

1869
02:35:51,180 --> 02:35:55,900
previous knowledge other than that first dinosaur like I was having a stroke trying to figure out

1872
02:36:11,340 --> 02:36:17,340
they can play and like on based on complexity but I actually need to make it a much better list

1873
02:36:17,340 --> 02:36:25,500
because I need to like add like how long it takes to play or these temporary areas oh it's Navi

i mean we ain't even done the tear list yet where i explain in detail every scenario i want to do to you

2143
03:10:14,060 --> 03:10:15,020
because of that tag

2144
03:10:19,020 --> 03:10:19,980
hydration check

2145
03:10:24,460 --> 03:10:27,820
strongy you make me fragile when you talk like that that's why i do it

2146
03:10:28,780 --> 03:10:36,940
they're gonna be a little me mark and be all happy and stuff but i do like the juxtaposition

2147
03:10:38,860 --> 03:10:43,340
as well as many other positions hold on a minute thank you

2148
03:10:45,340 --> 03:10:49,260
here all week dear mommy oh i did beat that one

2149
03:10:58,620 --> 03:11:07,260
oh wow someone's analizing my ovulation cycle so a normal ovulation cycle lasts about 24 hours

2150
03:11:07,260 --> 03:11:12,860
each month this is correct once an egg is released from an ovary it will dissolve within 12 to 24 hours

2151
03:11:13,820 --> 03:11:17,980
if it's not fertilized and the window is about a week before ovulation since it survives for

2152
03:11:17,980 --> 03:11:25,580
almost a week so basically if i was trying to fertilize you i would need to do it the day before

2153
03:11:25,580 --> 03:11:32,540
for optimum success chance which means the 13th of the month i'll refling you went gen 2 already

2154
03:11:33,420 --> 03:11:37,580
you missed your window of opportunity you're gonna have to try again next month with me huh

2155
03:11:38,380 --> 03:11:41,820
and we'll just keep trying and trying and trying

2156
03:11:46,140 --> 03:11:50,220
uh okay we did it

2157
03:11:50,700 --> 03:12:00,700

2164
03:12:42,940 --> 03:12:48,860
tism over things which helps me like just absolutely work out the wazoo um whenever i'm

2165
03:12:48,860 --> 03:12:56,940

03:20:40,060 --> 03:20:46,860
was like oh i do do stare contest and i would always lose because i suck i'm already in heaven

2225
03:20:46,860 --> 03:20:54,300
no need to go elsewhere will the member streams be archived i may not be able to tune in i'm not

2226
03:20:54,300 --> 03:21:04,460
gonna try and get them banned no i think we'll be okay we're gonna use our euphemisms where i go

2227
03:21:04,460 --> 03:21:16,380
tentacle and ink and i want to ink on the tentacle because we're cuttlefish out here we're cephalopods

2228
03:21:16,940 --> 03:21:22,940
but together we're a cephalopog because we're so cool like that yeah pogger

2229
03:21:25,020 --> 03:21:33,020
um have i ever heard about the gates by asa rock i'm so sorry i've never heard of that in my

2230
03:21:33,020 --> 03:21:40,700
life we're all stuck in perigatory keep that in mind because there may or may not be a collab

2231
03:21:40,700 --> 03:21:46,140
with a va and all villa members that is related to purgatory so keep that in mind

2232
03:21:48,220 --> 03:21:56,140
funny you brought a funny you brought that up yeah um imagine pieta but it's the virgin marie

2233
03:21:56,140 --> 03:22:01,500
given jesus whoa we we can't be saying that stuff out loud those are inside thoughts

2234
03:22:01,580 --> 03:22:07,900
so oh sounds interesting yeah you better be excited

2235
03:22:09,740 --> 03:22:17,900
i like when strony spoils i try my best i do i the dust is definitely settling on my list of

2236
03:22:17,900 --> 03:22:26,940
stuff to do like a lot of things are becoming a lot easier um and it's getting to the point where i

2237
03:22:26,940 --> 03:22:37,180
can fully be strummer yes i can be strummer um i i wouldn't mind having a clip manager but sadly um

2238
03:22:38,620 --> 03:22:49,340
i don't have anyone um i trust to be in that position um because clip manager needs access

2239
03:22:49,340 --> 03:22:53,900
to the girls accounts to see what people have been clipping and it ain't gonna happen so

2240
03:22:54,620 --> 03:22:59,580
unfortunately i am still clip manager at this point in time but it's not too bad because literally

2241
03:22:59,580 --> 03:23:03,500
i just take a clip and then i send it to editor then editor comes back and then i upload it on

2242
03:23:03,500 --> 03:23:12,300
girls channel and it's all hunky dory stop problem strummer i like when strony you didn't finish your

2243
03:23:12,300 --> 03:23:22,300
sentence mommy protecting her doors yes um i will be your shield i know not a lot you play

2244
03:23:22,300 --> 03:23:28,620
Overwatch i used to play it quite a lot sadly i fell out of love with it um when Overwatch 2 came

2245
03:23:28,620 --> 03:23:40,620
out but uh there is a girl called Brigitte Lentol and her slogan is i will be your shield and yes

2246
03:23:40,620 --> 03:23:49,740
i am Brigitte for my gen mates because i don't want anything happening to them um so i'm the i

2247
03:23:49,740 --> 03:23:58,300
am both the owl and the shield i love when strony does anything yes uh tomorrow's stream

2248
03:23:58,300 --> 03:24:07,500
i'm gonna see if i can get my heart rate monitor working um so i should be able to do that and

2249
03:24:07,500 --> 03:24:12,620
then you can see my heart rate during buckshot roulette i didn't manage to watch any more

2250
03:24:12,620 --> 03:24:20,700
cultural content because i literally i finished stream i did i see an me's memberships and then

2251
03:24:21,500 --> 03:24:27,180
then what would i do i don't know um and then i went on twitter i think i liked one thing and

2252
03:24:27,180 --> 03:24:35,260
then passed out and then i woke up like 45 minutes before stream i probably needed a big

2253
03:24:35,260 --> 03:24:39,500
sleep like that like it was coming it was coming that i needed a sleep like that

2254
03:24:40,060 --> 03:24:46,700
strony that was the whole scene wait what was the scene that's the whole scene

2255
03:24:48,140 --> 03:24:55,580
i also like when strony i do like when strony but why are clips private i don't know youtube

2256
03:24:55,580 --> 03:25:03,820
doesn't let people see what people have clipped on uh livestream or any content really if it was

2257
03:25:03,820 --> 03:25:10,460
public then i could get a clip master but i can't get a clip master because they're not public

2258
03:25:11,340 --> 03:25:17,100
but hopefully youtube changes that in a couple of months because that would then negate me even

2259
03:25:17,100 --> 03:25:25,180
needing to be a clip master um and then i can spend even more time we're briefly wait they're not

2260
03:25:26,060 --> 03:25:32,780
do you remember sending marshmallows to the girls i remember completely crashing on yesterday's

2261
03:25:32,780 --> 03:25:38,780
stream for anyone who wasn't watching the runescape stream i hit the 11 hour mark and became

2262
03:25:39,340 --> 03:25:45,100
delirious i spilled all my chips on the floor when i ended stream and i just left them until

2263
03:25:45,100 --> 03:25:54,780
this morning to clean up eat i was gone with the wind i i don't know what happened i ate food

2264
03:25:54,780 --> 03:26:01,820
and i was like oh this will wake me up this will wake me up no it freaking didn't day one day we'll

2265
03:26:01,820 --> 03:26:10,940
hit 12 hours for old school runescape honestly um no i didn't have any issues with it playing it but

2266
03:26:10,940 --> 03:26:16,620
i like completely crashed the ending of the stream was so funny i just remember being like oh let me

2267
03:26:16,620 --> 03:26:21,820
send the girl some marshmallows and then i started typing and i don't really remember what the contents

2268
03:26:21,820 --> 03:26:30,860
of it were but hopefully all is good um but yeah i remember just drinking losing it basically

2269
03:26:31,580 --> 03:26:36,940
i crashed way before that part of stream you used up all your energy trying to win connect for

2270
03:26:36,940 --> 03:26:42,460
unironically oh my god you if you didn't see runescape stream quick recap in runescape you

2271
03:26:42,460 --> 03:26:52,460
can play connect for i was getting decimated like the reeflings were like ganging up on me just

2272
03:26:52,460 --> 03:26:59,260
fucking one at a time one after the other like bro i just accepted my fate i could not win at connect

2273
03:26:59,980 --> 03:27:07,420
one i won one because i tried so hard and burnt my brain the second one i won by accident because

2274
03:27:07,420 --> 03:27:14,940
a reefling couldn't see what i was doing um i was gonna absolutely destroy yeah i remember my

2275
03:27:14,940 --> 03:27:23,100
sleep fading and then some strange noises coming up um sounds like a fun time bro i was perishing

2276
03:27:23,740 --> 03:27:28,220
i don't know what happened because normally i can last 12 hours and i had an eight hour sleep

2277
03:27:28,220 --> 03:27:34,300
before it but my brain oh my stomach just made a noise have you heard that my brain just perished

2278
03:27:34,300 --> 03:27:40,380
like it had enough it was like i'm sorry i can't hold out anymore checkers oh no i'm not playing

2279
03:27:40,380 --> 03:27:45,740
checkers again that was the most confusing thing i couldn't even bro we were playing checkers and i

2280
03:27:45,740 --> 03:27:54,780
couldn't even move on the board because i didn't know what was like going on um with the dang thing

2281
03:27:54,780 --> 03:28:01,340
it was a redonkiller hold on i'm just gonna pin the marshmallow oh my god that's me

2282
03:28:01,820 --> 03:28:11,420
that sounds like that q and a i say q and a is if we don't just like that's not the q and a

2283
03:28:11,420 --> 03:28:19,100
length hold on a minute that's the that's what the reefling said wait a minute who are you

2284
03:28:19,100 --> 03:28:32,300
i need to straw any cows there we go that's a bit of q and a q and maybe boom it's not really a

2285
03:28:32,300 --> 03:28:37,100

2288
03:28:53,420 --> 03:28:57,180
much questioning what on earth you were watching when you woke up just me raging

2289
03:28:59,340 --> 03:29:05,660

2296
03:29:51,980 --> 03:29:59,500
veil guard game um i've never played a dragon quest game properly sorry a dragon age game

2297
03:29:59,500 --> 03:30:04,860
properly uh i played the one where brother and sister and then brother like immediately well i

2298
03:30:04,860 --> 03:30:10,060
said for the brother or die i think uh i played it for like 30 minutes and i was like oh this ain't

2299
03:30:10,060 --> 03:30:16,780
for me um but there seems to be quite a lot of fans that are distraught at the reveal because

2300
03:30:16,780 --> 03:30:22,860
they don't like it but i thought it was just uh i think why do we hate brazil no it's a meme

2301
03:30:23,500 --> 03:30:29,020
where it's like oh come to brazil do a concert in brazil but brazil's really dangerous for foreigners

2302
03:30:29,020 --> 03:30:36,140
we don't actually hate brazil hi starney i agree with that one riff riefling when you rage i always

2303
03:30:36,140 --> 03:30:43,180
think of you pinning me down and having your your way with me and then not stopping even

2304
03:30:43,180 --> 03:30:49,660
when i finish oh my god rieflings this is good i don't think we could say any of this out loud

2305
03:30:51,340 --> 03:30:56,380
what if i'm here because i was hypnotized by a moment maybe the hypnosis is listening up

2306
03:30:56,380 --> 03:31:07,180
we should hypnotize more not yet you have to wait you have to wait soon it's overtism we're hitting

2307
03:31:07,180 --> 03:31:16,380
overdrive what was that stream song overdrive burning machine oh brain power that's it brain power

2308
03:31:17,100 --> 03:31:19,420
oh do do do do do do do

2309
03:31:21,980 --> 03:31:27,340
how did you decide which of the generation one one models were going to be used

2310
03:31:27,340 --> 03:31:32,140
where are there other people auditioning for strawney no um if you weren't there at the start

2311
03:31:32,140 --> 03:31:38,940
development all six models were laid out on the website under the auditions page uh i was codename

2312
03:31:38,940 --> 03:31:45,100
inks and it said i am a pre-selected talent but please apply to be my gen mate uh no one

2313
03:31:45,100 --> 03:31:50,940
could apply for strawney because i'm strawney there is only gonna be one strawney you can't you can't

2314
03:31:50,940 --> 03:32:03,340
get better than me okay uh welcome to the danger zone ora ora um as for who did i pick uh uh the

2315
03:32:03,340 --> 03:32:11,900
models for i did take into account what the girls went for but when i heard the girls voices

2316
03:32:12,220 --> 03:32:17,180
pretty much instantly my brain went oh okay that's gonna be enemy oh okay that's definitely

2317
03:32:17,180 --> 03:32:26,620
i say oh okay that's mercy oh that's our genre oh that's she be um because i got to hear them talk

2318
03:32:26,620 --> 03:32:31,900
in general in the introduction introduce yourself video and they gave me a good indication of

2319
03:32:31,900 --> 03:32:38,140
personality type and all that so if anyone wants to complain uh you you hired wrong you put someone

2320
03:32:38,140 --> 03:32:48,140
on the wrong shut shut don't want to hear it do you don't want to hear it uh for a siren that can't

03:32:48,140 --> 03:32:53,900
sing you just need to ramble and yap and i'll follow you under the waves i don't actually want you to

2322
03:32:53,900 --> 03:33:00,300
perish it was the concept artist that gave me that lore i don't want anyone to perish

2323
03:33:02,060 --> 03:33:03,740
can you say shut one more time shut

2324
03:33:04,060 --> 03:33:15,580

we fly let's stay to sleep and listen to my voice as i ramble you to sleep

2327
03:33:35,580 --> 03:33:43,020
stroney doesn't perish she just beats on you like the water helps with the things i need to do to you

2328
03:33:43,020 --> 03:34:01,740
okay seven days no ink help please how has it been so long i say that as if i'm not backed up but

2329
03:34:02,060 --> 03:34:11,340
how what do you mean help help uh this kind of help is that the help you need

2330
03:34:13,580 --> 03:34:21,500
uh is that what you need i don't know what help you need you didn't specify you got to specify

2331
03:34:21,500 --> 03:34:28,140
or i'm not gonna come up with them one hi stroney are there any talents of corpus you'd like you'd

2332
03:34:28,140 --> 03:34:34,540
like or veal or to collab within the future i'm humping new me plus and i'm humping v and you

2333
03:34:34,540 --> 03:34:42,620
because they were lovely um methos tal hq were very receptive to us as well sadly due to timing

2334
03:34:42,620 --> 03:34:48,140
couldn't do the watch longs but uh methos tal seemed to be kind of already leaning on the

2335
03:34:48,140 --> 03:34:54,940
alternative side which makes me quite comfortable with them as creators as for actual corporation

2336
03:34:55,740 --> 03:35:03,100
tubers uh i'm just if the person's happy with me i'm happy with them i never want to encroach

2337
03:35:03,100 --> 03:35:08,140
myself on someone and that's not the word at all i agree with those other two reef flings need

2338
03:35:08,140 --> 03:35:19,020
mummy to take all that rage out of my tentacle until it's ink to dry oh my god um mummy if one

2364
03:38:32,860 --> 03:38:42,300
ensuing um i do ah what's that game um it's hard because there's not a lot of six-man games so i

2365
03:38:42,300 --> 03:38:48,700
think it might have to be stuff like among us or lethal company i know residency for everyone

2366
03:38:48,700 --> 03:38:53,580
plays it but the problem is there's six of us there were many i think there's a back rooms game

2367
03:38:53,580 --> 03:39:01,740
that we can play together possibly um i do want to do monthly six-man collabs but after that um

2368
03:39:01,740 --> 03:39:08,220
it will be like two on two collabs maybe three three collabs angry scottish drunk karaoke went

2369
03:39:08,220 --> 03:39:19,740
soon i was gonna do a drunk karaoke um on um i don't know when i don't know when um but i was

2370
03:39:19,740 --> 03:39:25,660
going to do it on a weekend so like you guys can you know work work hard and then get all the relief

2371
03:39:25,660 --> 03:39:33,340
on the weekend and we get steamboats and all that when the talents are sourced jackbox would be great

2372
03:39:33,340 --> 03:39:39,900
but just with only one pop so you don't have to stream discord yes i am open to doing that um shebe

2373
03:39:40,540 --> 03:39:45,340
when we were first meeting for the first time i got the girls to play a game together and we

2374
03:39:45,340 --> 03:39:49,820
played jackbox and we all got addicted and we're like stuck i was like because it was only supposed

2375
03:39:49,820 --> 03:39:55,020
to be like a one hour icebreaker so the girls could get used to like each other because like from my

2376
03:39:55,020 --> 03:39:59,820
pov i knew the girls like i had consumed their content i knew kind of about them who they are

2377
03:39:59,900 --> 03:40:05,420
how they kind of are and all that jazz um and then we ended up playing for like two hours and i'm

2378
03:40:05,420 --> 03:40:09,660
like oh i'm so sorry like i didn't mean to steal all the time but then like it went two hours and a

2379
03:40:09,660 --> 03:40:16,300
half um in poor ac's tame zone i picked a really bad tame zone so she was so tired but she was

2380
03:40:16,300 --> 03:40:23,580
having so much fun she didn't want to get off um which was so cute and cute and good which says

2381
03:40:23,580 --> 03:40:30,540
cute if you put it dictionary oh we we're gonna possibly do a dictionary there's a new jackbox

2382
03:40:30,540 --> 03:40:37,820
18 that's released um okay i was gonna say i'm not sure we can hmm but we had fun on jackbox

2383
03:40:37,820 --> 03:40:44,620
it was so mean against ac though because english isn't her first language and one of the game modes

2384
03:40:44,620 --> 03:40:50,540
was like asking all these really like hard questions like even english speakers can't get it i felt so

2385
03:40:50,540 --> 03:40:57,820
bad for her and she kept like dying in the game i felt so bad um i see no one to get off that's

2386
03:40:57,820 --> 03:41:04,780

2436
03:47:27,500 --> 03:47:31,580
kind of questions um i'm staying away from the permanent stuff because it makes me a bit nervous

doing any permanent effects stuff but i already have a public release audio that will undo any

2438

2443
03:48:15,580 --> 03:48:27,100
feel about male figurines being used in bibbute videos yeah you can do that um but maybe maybe

2444
03:48:27,100 --> 03:48:39,900
in the future you can use official veiler merch association figurines that's not something i

2445
03:48:40,140 --> 03:48:46,460
need a fixation oh i got five at 10 i got seven i got nine at 10 i like the transparency though

2446
03:48:46,460 --> 03:48:50,540
because you're just a normal person at the end of the day yeah actually can i say something

2447
03:48:50,540 --> 03:48:57,420
that's really disrespectful and i mean no disrespect when i say it you know those vtuber's that have

2448
03:48:57,420 --> 03:49:02,940
those donations where like items get thrown at the vtuber model when they get a donation and then the

2449
03:49:02,940 --> 03:49:13,900
vtuber goes like the the every time i consume any of that i this is very disrespectful and i don't

2450
03:49:13,900 --> 03:49:20,380
mean it this way it makes me cringe to think that they're in a room on their own with the iphone

2451
03:49:20,380 --> 03:49:33,580
tracking them and going i'm so sorry i'm like actually so sorry for me for me it's a no but

2452
03:49:33,580 --> 03:49:38,620
people find it entertaining which is really cute i like that people can get so entertained and so

2453
03:49:39,420 --> 03:49:47,500
enveloped um that it's humorous so i do apologize to anyone that i made him uh i think yeah i've seen

2454
03:49:47,580 --> 03:49:55,180
it too twitch integrated throwing system oh okay is that what it's called and yeah and here you are

2455
03:49:55,180 --> 03:50:01,900
veiler figures that well adjusted people could be normal don't think about it harder it makes the

2456
03:50:01,900 --> 03:50:08,140
cringe yeah i remember seeing a clip about it and i was like don't get me wrong i'm a cringe fest if

2457
03:50:08,140 --> 03:50:14,780
you sit through one stream of mine but i remember seeing it and i was like oh that's rough that's

2458
03:50:14,860 --> 03:50:21,740
rough even for me to digest but i mean absolutely no disrespect when i say that like whatever

2459
03:50:21,740 --> 03:50:28,780
works for you works for you some people are balls to the wall in immersion and that's fantastic

2460
03:50:28,780 --> 03:50:34,780
for me um i am absolutely in love that reeflings are in love with pilot in america it makes me

2461
03:50:34,780 --> 03:50:42,380
incredibly comfortable um like streaming and acknowledging like oh i need to only go put my

2462
03:50:42,380 --> 03:50:51,100
boots on uh instead of like being like i love you so much feeling like bro ain't no one here for that

2463
03:50:51,100 --> 03:50:57,180
well some people might be here for that but me i'm not here for that you know um

2464
03:51:00,220 --> 03:51:06,140
yeah it's basically just beautiful but i don't mind like the roleplay like if i had a 3d model or

2465
03:51:06,140 --> 03:51:11,740
i'll be roleplaying at the wazoo so i'm probably gonna be hypocritical with that statement it's

2466
03:51:11,740 --> 03:51:17,740
not even a statement it's just me blabbering any blabberers the heart eyes yeah i love that my

2467
03:51:17,740 --> 03:51:23,660
heart eyes are so different like oh my god my squiddles where'd my squiddly pupils go give me my

2468
03:51:23,660 --> 03:51:38,380
squiddly pupils back wait wait wait wait hold on you ready for this you ready for this oh wait no

oh where's my question mark wow

2471
03:51:53,340 --> 03:51:57,100
me when me when there's actually a refractory period i can't believe it

2472
03:51:58,940 --> 03:52:03,980
any merch you'd like to have made in the future even if it ain't the the typical
