1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,560
Growing up in the open seas, there are stories told of the monsters that lurked below,

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:15,440
deadly Leviathans, monstrous serpents, yet no giant could hope to match the lethal efficiency

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:26,480
of one such creature, equal in elegance incarnate, so alluring yet so deadly, so hypnotically fatal

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:36,400
as the siren, the succubi of the sea, the witch of the waves, the black widows of the, uh, black sea,

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,680
a maiden with a hypnotic gaze that warped the wills of even the most salt-seasoned captains,

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,920
and a song that commanded the crews of even the most loyal sailors.

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,880
My mother would read me these tales before bed, tales of aquatic femme fatales that lured men to

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:02,640
sail themselves to their blood-soaked watery graves. These horrific tales of nautical nefariousness

9
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:12,080
would keep me up at night. They made me feel so, so inspired. I mean, my people used to do that?

10
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,480
That's so cool. I mean, I've never fed on a human before, and the smartest thing I've ever hypnotized

11
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:25,440
is a seal. But learning that my ancestors used to eat humans by the literal boatloads was amazing.

12
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,360
I couldn't wait to grow up and eat my fill, fat ones, tall ones, skinny ones, even hairy ones.

13
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:40,960
Though I learned our people aren't as feared by humans as they once were. My ocean, my home, humans

14
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:48,080
to fail it with their presence. Worse still, they tossed their filth into it, further insulting us.

15
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,640
How could this have happened? How were we brought so low from our past? They used to tell legends on

16
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,160
every port that made even the most straight-laced superstition scoffing marines keep in the back

17
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,360
of their minds. They would dedicate figureheads of their ships in respect to our beautiful yet

18
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:12,560
delicate bodies. They put us on every map. But now? Ugh, disgusting humans.

19
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,920
One night, I envisioned a genius plan, the first strike in my crusade against the human world.

20
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,360
I would infiltrate in hijack a fishing vessel and use it as my own pirate vessel with a crew of

21
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,080
hypnotized thralls. I was going to wage a once siren war against all of humanity. It was going to

22
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:41,200
be perfect, and I definitely would have won. That was until I envisioned a plan that was even more

23
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:49,360
perfect. Er, well, at least more time efficient. Making my way below deck, I made a strange discovery.

24
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:58,240
The humans were hypnotized by their own choice. I couldn't believe it. I looked at boat after boat,

25
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:05,920
these humans charmed like a siren's spell, even dedicating their lives to their chosen idols.

26
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:14,400
These idols they fawn over were these sirens too. That's it. That's the secret to defeating the humans.

27
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,840
I'm going to find the secret to their magic and harness this power myself and bring power back

28
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,720
to my people. I must gather fame, fortune, scandals, anything and everything to grow my influence over

29
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,800
mankind to bring sirens back into the minds of the people. But I'm not just going to tip the

30
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:41,920
scales. I'm going for complete domination. Every human will bend to my will. All will be cheering

31
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,920
for their own demise. I will be the instrument of karmic justice. The world will worship me and

32
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,400
praise my name as I bring about their end. I will march every human under my control into the ocean,

33
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,680
and my people will chant my name as they have a feeding frenzy that has written into legend.

34
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:12,640
Though that's a very long-term goal. With every big venture, whether business-wise or lifestyle,

35
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:30,880
every big undertaking starts small scale, right? Hmm. So, I think I'll start with you.
