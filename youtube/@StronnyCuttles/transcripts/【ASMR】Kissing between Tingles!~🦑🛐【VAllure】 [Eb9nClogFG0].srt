1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You're okay, I'll test this side you're here, then I'll test this side, you're okay, you're okay, it's okay.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'll just need to test the audio level, so why?

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's all I need to do, shh, it's okay, it's okay.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I had to test the audio level Starlet Noray, it's okay.

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You can fit the brush and I'll read them all, boy.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We're taking it nice and steady, and you may notice that there's a new emote for those of you who have emotes.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It turns out that I had so many gifted memberships, but I lost the cream, not being a GR, so there may not be a pregnant me at the moment temporarily.

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's not gonna stay, but just so you know, it's there.

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Thank you to everyone who has gifted membership or become a member.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I do, I have a long-term emote slot because of that, and thank you for everyone.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hey, check the pregnant with you ASMR, people will know it's a volume low, is it too low?

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hold on, I can do this, okay, I'm just turning myself up.

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I can also turn myself on.

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Mommy has a cup of tea, so I'm gonna have some tea, okay?

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Do you want the volume up louder?

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I can better up a wee bit louder as well.

18
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You do.

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah, I think people were like, oh, this meme, this ASMR is obviously going to be a meme.

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And then, surprise, it's actually the most try-hard ASMR I've probably done so far.

21
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay, I'm gonna drink my tea, my honey tea.

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I have an update for Patreon, so because of a very small oversight, I apologize to snippets,

23
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
but everyone now has their four months Patreon up, but that was just a few internal issues.

24
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:42,000
For my Reflings on Patreon, I have wrote the script of I Groom You.

25
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I will be recording it very shortly, and it will go up today, because I need a little day.

26
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The viewer clipping program is also about to launch, and I am a very tired little cut offish.

27
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I've had three hours of sleep, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

28
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm gonna just, okay, I'm gonna slurp my cup of tea, okay?

29
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, yes, three hours.

30
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Three hours is not enough, no, I don't think it is either.

31
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't think it is either.

32
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Thank you for the pregnancy ASMR you did great.

33
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I had so many nice comments.

34
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
A lot of people said, like, oh, it looks like a shitpost, but when you click on it, it sprawls up,

35
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and I'm like, yeah, that's a surprise.

36
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You think it's gonna be low quality, and no surprise.

37
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Being pregnant with 9000 of us.

38
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Mommy Kate's treasure is what she cannot be said.

39
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Well, someone was like, oh, I was hoping the next day were in you,

40
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
he'll be in your stomach, and I'm like, oh, so you want me to go back to the artist

41
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and get a three part four artwork?

42
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Say no more.

43
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Don't think I won't go back to the artist and draw me eating you and thank you in my stomach.

44
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And I'll get the cry in the mouth of you in my stomach.

45
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So thank you for becoming a member, I appreciate it.

46
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm not gonna role play this stream, okay?

47
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I didn't prepare anything to role play, so I'm gonna tinkle you,

48
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and I'm gonna give you kisses all through this stream, deal?

49
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Deal.

50
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What does it mean?

51
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No, no, no.

52
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's a role play.

53
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll make a role play of me eating you.

54
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yeah, so we will be having fun with that very shortly.

55
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm down now.

56
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We win as every other day.

57
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And things are moving so fast, I'm not even kidding.

58
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Now it's not a four stream, relax.

59
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm not eating you, okay?

60
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm not eating you.

61
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm seeing my next cursed ASMR on YouTube, like as a video, not a stream.

62
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And as I'm gonna eat you.

63
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I mean, come on, look at my teeth.

64
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
My first thesis for sleep deprived mommy.

65
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I think I may just put you in my tummy for a little bit and then I'll

66
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
spend you back up again, because I don't want you to be obscenity spaghetti.

67
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I don't like when you perish in the ASMR full place, it makes me sad.

68
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So I think I'll just let you sleep in my stomach and then I'll bring you home,

69
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
or I'm gonna imply I'll bring you home, okay?

70
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Disgustingly, I cure barf.

71
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Okay, I finished my day.

72
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
As always, I have my little blue, blue, blue.

73
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Blue, blue, blue.

74
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Protect us from the stomach acid, mummy fruit.

75
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Actually, the teeth you have are too bright for me.

76
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And you do for, you have to do something with a pelican knife.

77
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
For informants, really, it's real hard.

78
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Clearly, it's pretty cool to the brain that it's ASMR.

79
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The artist did such a good job, honestly.

80
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So we're being avoided.

81
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah, I'm not putting any digestion stuff on yet.

82
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't want you to perish at the role play.

83
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I love you replaying some of the best for you.

84
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And if you get digested, then that's not the best.

85
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Next.

86
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Wow.

87
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
No, no.

88
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
These ones are elite.

89
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
See, when the last one goes like, click on the glass,

90
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't like when it does that though.

91
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's bad ASMR.

92
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:06,000
oh yeah does it want to make you be the father of yourself someone asked and I'm like oh someone's not being watched in the streets

93
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:15,000
because you're the father and you're the baby and thank you for not wanting to stay at the pleasures homemade

94
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I actually don't know if it worked it just happened we're just going to let it happen ok

95
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm so tired so I'm just insane

96
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
mommy eating us their birth in us just a circle of life for every plant

97
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I mean like none of it makes sense lore-wise

98
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
takeona thank you for becoming a member your profile picture is absolutely horrifying

99
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
it's like a smiling peanut

100
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
thank you for coming to me bar and the directs for

101
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
who's then calling us out in the background that is for decorational purposes

102
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
look my 3D horse on the desk I told you I had to do 3D horse

103
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
that is for practical effects ok

104
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
it's not for any nefarious activities

105
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
get in my tummy I've had a nickel for every time

106
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
a character with a Scottish accent said that I have 2 nickels in beard

107
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
that's so cute

108
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
and none of it makes sense lore-wise but it's funny it's very good

109
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
literally so you guys I've been in my belly and I've been pregnant with you

110
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
you've also been the father and you're also the father of any generation

111
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:58,000
a feeler like you know like Shibi, Azera, Mercy, ME, AC, you're the father to all of them

112
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
cause I was pregnant with them

113
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
but Azera is like the goddess of fertility and she's the mother of all of humanity

114
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I give birth to the mother of all of humanity

115
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I made this literally like a feeler development team takes a year to come out with a generation

116
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
you guys are like I made this, smile

117
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
child support is gonna suck

118
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
yeah

119
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
you're your own grandma, like a grandma

120
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
wait this is for pregnancy I think you're confusing the rules cause no this isn't for

121
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I did have pregnancy roleplays on YouTube right now

122
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
but I'm just saying lore implication-wise

123
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
the reeflings have done everything and nothing makes sense

124
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
yeah we made this

125
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
cuttlefish can have 100 to 300 babies in a batch

126
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
well unfortunately this cuttlefish can only have 17 max, thank you

127
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
okay I put this down

128
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
17 babies is more than plenty

129
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
yeah I agree

130
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I agree

131
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
so I'm just kind of feeling in your ear

132
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
just like that all of my subs for pregnant

133
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
17 that's all I need to know

134
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
look all I'm saying is I don't know

135
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
is in October okay

136
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
and if I am lucky

137
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
then we'll be able to

138
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
you know turn the lights off and I'll tell ya

139
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm more feeling

140
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
17-8 and now

141
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
17 girls is more than enough to manage

142
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm lucky I'm a part of the team

143
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I also would be 18 girls and I'm like oh I can't even imagine a gen 4

144
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
please please please

145
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm already struggling to

146
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
direct my daughters on the floor

147
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
if we are making too more chance with mommy

148
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
you are

149
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
and I'll tell you exactly when

150
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I need your aid

151
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
wait so Mary sees your daughter

152
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
yeah and A.C. and Amy and she be in a server all

153
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and might tell me together at the same time

154
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
for one year

155
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
because the girls were concepted in June last year

156
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and it took an entire year

157
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
from the start of concept art

158
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
to get all the assets

159
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
all the models

160
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
all the preparation work

161
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
oh what is making that noise

162
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
a wire, how dare it

163
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
so Amy is your daughter and your little sister

164
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
exactly

165
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I think it's needed to sketch the designs

166
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I mean that's true

167
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
that's an awfully long chair station

168
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
there was five of them

169
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
you don't have enough nip nip for the number of babies

170
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I love my daughter's sister

171
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
do you have mom Azura and she be in a

172
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
so Azura, lord wise, is straight up like the mom of humanity

173
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
so I can't really out mom her

174
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
she be, I can out mom

175
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
easy peasy, lemon squeezy, lord wise

176
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
she be hasn't actually pulped out

177
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
she hasn't pulped out a wing, you know

178
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
but she's called Mel from body type

179
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
her sister has a baby

180
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
cute, adorable

181
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I love her door and mother way

182
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
obviously

183
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
yay I get to catch a stream

184
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
thank you for joining everyone

185
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I really appreciate it

186
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I know I'm not the most professional

187
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I face more life

188
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
especially when I don't

189
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
when I don't have a script

190
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
but I'm glad I can tinkle your life at all

191
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
so yeah

192
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Azura pulped out plainly

193
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
she literally pulped out in her first words

194
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
where I need gold and I'm like what for

195
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
but yeah

196
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
your voice is making company

197
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
ah ye

198
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
you didn't find no give kisses

199
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
only if you say please

200
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
say please give me kisses mommy

201
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
say please give me kisses mommy

202
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
oh like a well-baked ui

203
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
cute little replant

204
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
kiss

205
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
kiss

206
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
is that better

207
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
have I paid the kissing debt

208
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
actually I'm not paid the membership kissing debt

209
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I saw someone ask about that

210
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I know I'm not paid the membership kissing debt

211
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
kiss

212
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
kiss

213
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
kiss

214
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
wow

215
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
okay

216
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I need to know breathe when I kiss

217
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
because of youtube's rules

218
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
because of youtube's new rules

219
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I can't breathe when I'm doing kissing ASMR

220
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
so I literally have to go

221
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I think

222
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
yes for some reason

223
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
inner ear breathing

224
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
is a valuable event

225
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
like a content strike

226
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and I'm already on a warning that doesn't expire

227
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
until September

228
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
yeah

229
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
in particular

230
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
like I can still do ear blowing

231
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
ah

232
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
tada

233
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
yes youtube I assume

234
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I spend it to the well of payment processors as always

235
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
so

236
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
mommy can hold her breath

237
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
if I'm doing cute

238
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I had to figure out via trial and error

239
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
because thankfully

240
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
other ASMR creators

241
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
most problems

242
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
that they've been having and I saw

243
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
another creator

244
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
and they did

245
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
they were injured in their roleplay

246
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
so they grunted

247
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
but it was in the ear

248
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
and youtube like gave a strike to their video

249
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
and I was like ah

250
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
okay

251
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I know that my video was removed

252
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
because the tape stamp was when I breathed in the ear

253
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
and then I saw that

254
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
and then it just correlated with everything

255
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
and yeah

256
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
so I managed to figure out that

257
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
you can do kissing

258
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and you can technically do ear licking

259
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
but you cannot breathe while you do it

260
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
doesn't make sense

261
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I don't understand

262
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
but yeah

263
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
basically

264
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
literally the clapping ASMR was fine

265
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I don't know how

266
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
youtube is jealous that they don't give a fuck

267
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
so yeah

268
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
basically

269
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I made the

270
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
ear licking ASMR video

271
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
at a later point

272
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
with no breathing

273
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
just to get to this

274
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
that my hypothesis is correct

275
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
because I'm 99% sure is

276
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
we're returning to puritan times

277
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
it's rather fun being a creator

278
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
when they don't publicly say there's been an update to T.O.S

279
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
go on

280
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
go on youtube

281
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
tell us what you've done

282
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
we already know

283
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
but yes

284
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
on the 19th of September

285
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
my

286
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
warning is lifted

287
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
so I can repost my content

288
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
again to try

289
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
with what I wanted to

290
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I have a warning

291
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Emmy has a warning

292
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and a sir has a warning

293
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I don't actually think AC has a warning

294
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
so

295
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
yeah

296
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
so

297
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
it's a very interesting

298
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
campaign

299
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
thank you to Don and the

300
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Howdy Cuttlefish House of Ocean

301
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
and again

302
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
you should come down and breathe in the water

303
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I promise it's vain

304
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and that I'm not a sire at all

305
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
that has a desire

306
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I forgot why Emmy called

307
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
warning

308
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I have no idea

309
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
youtube here

310
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I can't stand breathing ASMR

311
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
so weak

312
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
and Uncle Roger acts it

313
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I feel like I'm going to get exited

314
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
but not everyone plays fair

315
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm going to tell the girls

316
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
they need to ease up

317
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
on streaming content

318
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
that needs to be removed

319
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
as soon as your stream is finished

320
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
because we're starting to go on

321
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
three months of streaming

322
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
and some of the youtube channels

323
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
are looking a bit barren

324
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
and I'm like

325
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
let's ease up on the DMCA

326
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
we're going a little bit too far

327
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
okay

328
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
because that content's looking a wee bit barren

329
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
what if I could have spun two days

330
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I don't know if the sponge is too loud

331
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
do you guys want to know

332
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
a really disgusting fact

333
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
repairs

334
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
thank you for the super chat

335
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
the deep blue has a lot to show me today

336
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
but do you remember

337
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
when I did

338
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
10k

339
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
a smart bath celebration stream

340
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
when I did

341
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
10k

342
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
a smart bath celebration stream

343
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
when I did

344
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
10k

345
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
10k

346
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
10k

347
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
10k

348
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
10k

349
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
10k

350
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
a smart bath celebration stream

351
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I forgot to drain the bath

352
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
yeah

353
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I made to get my ASMR tools

354
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
and the bath water

355
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
was still there

356
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I don't know if the sponge sounds nice

357
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I could wait the sponge a bit

358
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
hold on

359
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'll wait the sponge

360
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I forgot to drain it

361
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
it was disgusting

362
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It was showing

363
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
how much

364
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
no you're not buying my

365
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
my marinated

366
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
cuttlefish

367
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
stock

368
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
and you didn't BOW it

369
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Mummy I could just forget

370
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I just

371
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
whenever I stream

372
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I get very tired

373
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
by the end of it

374
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
like

375
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
a bit like

376
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
rain, rain, not two free flints, you're in the same brain cell, look, they're right next to each other on the comb, ah, ah, ah, ah

377
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:48,000
okay, does that sponge sound okay, or do you want a different tingle, I don't know, does that sound bad, hold on

378
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I don't know

379
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
cause it still shows how long she goes

380
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:11,000
really, it's like the top, like it has remnants of the oil and then the soap and all of that

381
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
see, out of, out of, out of, out of me, I bet you like that, school is an enemy character

382
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,000
do you want to know what really went back, did you just cover the water with this stone this morning cause you didn't touch it

383
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
okay, you don't want, you don't have to say it like that

384
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
repairs, you are sailing at one way or another

385
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
okay, like, don't look on, fang, I'll send you freaking samples of the bathwater

386
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
you know TV, like, is this supposed to stop us from licking

387
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I will make an e-girl bathwater tier list, give me some of that stoke, that's actually really funny

388
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:11,000
could you imagine, feeler, fucking, a stoke of old girls, you can get rabbit boil, you can get um, coke, you can get, you can get polar bear, cuttlefish

389
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,000
and then, I guess little sister stoke, and uh, well, young dairy stoke

390
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:28,000
mix them all together, mix a heavenly concoction, I don't know what they could have like some sort of psychedelic effect

391
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:39,000
you can't handle my strongest potion, give yourself some levers, let them know you're useful to them

392
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
don't ever say little sisters stoke again

393
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
if you mix them all together, you summon the secret seventh member, feeler, real true

394
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
you need to be careful, you're gonna summon her in the damn fucking stream, honestly

395
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
there should probably be larkin in the shadows right now

396
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
we're caught, we're catching coal, we're gonna end this one

397
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
that member me

398
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
another member confirmed, yeah, the nipple higher

399
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
this one he has the biggest member, oh dear, yeah

400
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
he's came to say goodnight, rest well, little wreathless

401
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
we have about two minutes left

402
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
we have about two minutes left

403
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
we have about two minutes left

404
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
we have about two minutes left

405
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
he's came to say goodnight, rest well, little wreathless

406
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
we have about two minutes left

407
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
management with the seventh member all along

408
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I cannot handle your strongest path, waver, nectar seller

409
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
the secret seventh member is Johnny's time

410
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
wait, are you guys trolling, or is it, have I not made it obvious though?

411
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I feel like you guys are trolling me

412
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
when I did the gen 2 drawing stream, I only drew five girls

413
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
your subscriber here, just wanted to say your works in person, thanks, you're more than welcome

414
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
thank you for being in my tummy as I'm braiding with you

415
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
the seventh member is actually the voice acting of the girls

416
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I barely survived against the path where you're unbelievably strong

417
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
my strongest path water traveler, Shirley the chore

418
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
mommy have a tummy, you want kisses to make it better, okay?

419
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I am not offering bread loaves on my donut on, no, we are not doing that

420
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I assure you that much

421
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
we get a share that says I survived Johnny's path water for 2024, honestly

422
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
honestly mate

423
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
we draw but we have high insight scores, that's why we can see you're a kingpin

424
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
literally

425
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
skullfish stalk would just be a pain to feel

426
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
stop, that's actually so funny

427
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
that's so cute

428
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
okay

429
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I have an old collar that I can put on you

430
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
okay, I'm just gonna put it on you now

431
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I'm actually taking out of its wee strappy thing

432
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
this isn't my collar, it's not a right j-hope, I was gonna put this collar on you just cause I can

433
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
hold still

434
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
hold still

435
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
okay

436
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
it's almost on the collar side of this

437
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
oh god, I'm stuck like this

438
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
why is it so hard to put one stop there then?

439
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I actually can't keep it on

440
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
okay, there we go

441
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
there you go, okay, keep your long collars

442
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
it's like, yeah, it's a cute long collar

443
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
we're cute

444
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
next, we need the gloves, the milking gloves

445
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
these are just regularly latex gloves, okay?

446
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
don't, don't

447
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
is this shock?

448
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
no, I would never put a shock collar on

449
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I cannot tell you how scary that shock stream was

450
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I spoke to Shibi last night

451
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and I was like, girl, you better be careful with that shock collar

452
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
cause it is science

453
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
and she's like, not anywhere

454
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
if you didn't know, Shibi's still in the shock

455
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
a collar stream and a heart rate monitor

456
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
it's coming up soon to you, I don't know why

457
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
because La Ofiya

458
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
sorry, this tape is so long to put these gloves on

459
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and Fiya isn't very well at the moment

460
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
so she's just doing nothing

461
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
wow, please, path over sailor

462
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I'm gonna break it

463
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
should I do e-girl sales or path over to you?

464
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
ASMR, I will rate that down, cause that's funny

465
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
alright, hold on, hold on, rate that down

466
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
rate that down, rate that down

467
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
e-girl, no, feature, no e-girl

468
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
feature where it just

469
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
her path over to you

470
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
her path over

471
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
to you, ASMR

472
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I have so many good ideas

473
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
cause I'm milking them from you

474
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
it's all good, I'm gonna put

475
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm gonna put this on your ears

476
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
okay?

477
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
the equals to 17 kids, 5 girls in this

478
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
there's 6 girls in the next, J, and 6 in the other

479
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
every generation will have 6 girls in the alarm

480
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
what I'm saying is

481
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
there's an apple higher if J2 continues

482
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm gonna get it across

483
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
shocking thing, yeah

484
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
meta is a more milking reason to record

485
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm not even sure how to get away with that

486
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I feel proud, I get to make the path more ideal for us one

487
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
you're, you're, you're a brain, you're a brain stringer

488
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
fun ideas, mainly because I said biotic

489
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I love said biotic

490
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
it's such a good concept

491
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
and

492
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
in this J2 you always talk about, about there are girls

493
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
yeah, there's girls

494
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
why would there be girls?

495
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
nipple higher, which

496
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
you call the stream like hi

497
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I'm strong and I

498
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I'm Scottish and I have

499
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
5 gen mates

500
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
and those gen mates are super awesome

501
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
and their links are in the description

502
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
and they also do ASMR stuff too, that's true

503
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
girls, I want to see men

504
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
can you remember it?

505
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
cowfish physically picks your brain

506
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
that they have a wire

507
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
sorry if I'm not talking too much

508
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm obviously doing this as

509
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
your level of sleepiness

510
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
they're decent

511
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
we're almost at the 2 month mark

512
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
and I get to post my little collage

513
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
of all the streams we had this month

514
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I'm a happy being

515
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I think I have to say

516
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I have to say

517
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
that I think supermarket simulator

518
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
was my favorite game this month

519
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I knew I didn't go back to it

520
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
but I could see myself

521
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
like rolling on that game

522
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
what is this scent?

523
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
it literally takes gloves on

524
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and then I have earmuffs

525
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
over the microphone

526
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
and I'm just rubbing

527
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
over the earmuffs

528
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
it wasn't felt true

529
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm not allowed to play felt true anymore

530
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
because the flash stream

531
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
didn't do so well

532
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
and I need to

533
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
like

534
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
a few different things

535
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm gonna do

536
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000

538
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000

539
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000

540
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm gonna do it on the floor

541
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
and I'm gonna leave

542
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000

543
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I'm gonna get some more

544
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000

545
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
oh my god sorry I need to take the clothes off

546
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I can't open them more

547
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
okay

548
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I need to do a hand cam for both of us

549
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I'm gonna look at

550
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
really hard for

551
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
a lot

552
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
of people to look at

553
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
or please remember to hi jaco

554
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I lost the cam

555
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
filling up the gloves

556
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
there's another grocery store game

557
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
that has 4 pairs of gloves

558
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
stop

559
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
your ears are fantastic

560
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
me is me in a band

561
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
look forward to future streams

562
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I'm glad

563
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
oh that was my throat

564
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I had a throat in my throat

565
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I definitely

566
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
plan another hypnosis

567
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
video some more stream

568
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
but I don't know

569
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
what I should do to you

570
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
in it

571
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
if that makes any sense

572
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
maybe

573
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I'll test

574
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
to forget your name script

575
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
just to try

576
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
you know cause that's a bit more

577
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
like

578
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
heavily suggestive

579
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
you know

580
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I can't watch your streams

581
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
cause you're live early in the morning

582
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
and I work Saturdays don't worry

583
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
it's 4 am for me

584
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and it is very very early

585
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
but

586
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm very excited

587
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
to play like a lord of the rings with you

588
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
oh my god

589
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
you have no idea

590
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
but just as a remainder

591
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
we flanks the mortal

592
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I come up late 2 hours later

593
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
than my usual start day

594
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
because because because because

595
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
because

596
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
the meeting is tomorrow

597
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Chris Underground

598
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
thank you for becoming a member

599
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
and for direct support

600
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
you've never played a Lego game

601
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
oh boy

602
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
they are like

603
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
an actual idol man

604
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
honestly

605
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
when you put down your water

606
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
since the sound quality changed

607
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I bloody hope not

608
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
it's a shame

609
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
it's on him

610
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
quiet man, no thoughts

611
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
oh ok

612
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
ok

613
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
if you're changing our name

614
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
you can possibly give us a tour

615
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
of the different world or time

616
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
we can play with imagery into her

617
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
did the mate get unplugged?

618
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
ok are you trolling?

619
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
ok

620
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I've taken off the ear muffs

621
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
are you guys trolling

622
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
or did something actually happen?

623
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
everything looks correct to me

624
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
my OBS disconnected

625
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
oh it might be the rim creaking

626
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I just disconnected

627
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
on OBS

628
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
it sounds good now

629
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I've never trolled this shop

630
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
ok you guys are still there

631
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000

632
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
thank you for joining

633
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000

00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I'm Johnny

636
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
he sent it ok

637
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
maybe they didn't realise that

638
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
the earmuffs on

639
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I disconnected

640
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I don't know why

641
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
it randomly disconnected me

642
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I'm sorry

643
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
it's ok we flings

644
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
we're still together

645
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
this is a perfect opportunity

646
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
to introduce yourself and your genies

647
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
hi

648
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I'm Johnny

649
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I'm the Scottish Gen

650
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I smell berries

651
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I see snowballs

652
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I have 5 gen mates

653
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
if I'm not the flavour for you

654
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
your time is perfect for EU

655
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
which is a relief because it's hard to find EU

656
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I have to go to work

657
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I'm sorry

658
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
memory dietry

659
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
loud farbs out

660
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
this isn't an Emmy donation stream

661
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
oh no he's drawn

662
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000

663
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
sorry

664
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
people are not thinking of making a reference to Emmy's

665
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I see

666
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I see so excited to come back to you

667
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000

668
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
and I'm very excited

669
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
with what she's got planned for you

670
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
she's done a lot of behind the scenes work

671
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
so don't worry snowberries

672
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000

673
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000

I'm listening to you

675
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I'll work right now

676
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
that's good

677
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
that's annoying

678
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
but good at this sort of thing

679
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
to deal with that voice

680
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I don't know what that means

681
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Johnny is like an intrusive

682
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000

Even funny, strong, it'd be over for you, Motherfuckers.

700
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
You already know it's the most outrageous shit.

701
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
It would be awa.

702
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Can we smoke? Look at the seaweed.

703
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Hello, friend.

704
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Good morning, Sonny-chan.

705
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I love you.

706
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
We ended the jokes and you were in the sub-star here.

707
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Looking great today. Thanks.

708
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I never do anything different with the both of you.

709
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
What happens if I'm in the shadow mode into this?

710
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Oh, that still works. What about this?

711
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Okay.

712
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Oh, that looks weird.

713
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I've not highlighted it for this, but yeah.

714
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Oh, my question mark isn't highlighted.

715
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
This is blush.

716
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,000
You can see the W.M.L.F. people.

717
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Thank goodness the microphone is there.

718
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Thank goodness the microphone is there.

719
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I'm sorry.

720
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I'm sorry.

721
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I'm sorry.

722
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I'm sorry.

723
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I'm sorry.

724
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I guess the microphone is there.

725
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I didn't see a thing.

726
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I didn't see a thing.

727
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Thank you, buddy.

728
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:31,000
That was literally like a slow-motion anime thing that just happened there.

729
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Mommy, what color?

730
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I actually did Fiboncos, our boxers.

731
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
They're black.

732
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
There are no panties today.

733
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I have girl boy shorts. They're called boy shorts.

734
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I have black boy shorts on.

735
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
They're not there with your name.

736
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
They're any flesh-balling type of boxers.

737
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Those boxers are literally made.

738
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Black boxers stand here real good.

739
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I mean, what if I know a top-boy maxing to me?

740
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
How much more?

741
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
100 years. Thank you for the extended membership.

742
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I love your hypnosis stream. Thank you for all the work you do.

743
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Thank you for being so patient for it as well.

744
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
It was a long day in the making.

745
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I think we will be able to do at least one serious hypnosis stream a month.

746
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Once everything comes down, because everything is chaos behind the scenes right now,

747
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
everything is on fire. It's okay. I'll make it work.

748
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
But I do want to do the forget-your-name one with me.

749
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And then we'll come up with a few hypnosis

750
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
role-play for YouTube that we want to do.

751
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Okay.

752
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
And we'll take it from there. But thank you very much, Andreas.

753
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I appreciate it.

754
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Thank you.

755
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Thank you.

756
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Thank you.

757
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Thank you.

758
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Your call, I bet you don't even like real call three.

759
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It's like a screen take and centered call.

760
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I love tinfoil music.

761
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Because you had the dentist appointment.

762
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I hope your little make-up teeth are okay.

763
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
You always good. Why should we put pressure on you?

764
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Great. She asked me back to work.

765
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I don't know. Maybe if you make me a pressure cooker, the race will come at faster.

766
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Okay. This is going to start so boring.

767
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
But I'm really excited for next week.

768
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Because I've been looking into meal prep.

769
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
And I'm going to try and make a free soup for streams.

770
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Because I've been really bad.

771
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
And I've been eating takeaway and I feel rubbish.

772
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
So I'm going to make a chicken soup.

773
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I've made it before.

774
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
But I'm not very good at it.

775
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
So I know it's boring, but I'm excited for it.

776
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And I hope it comes out really good.

777
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Because I get to put all my vegetables in it.

778
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Because I've been feeling a bit sick recently.

779
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And my legs, oh my god.

780
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I was walking a magpie home yesterday.

781
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
So I went to the shops.

782
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And on the way back, I think I made it to the start.

783
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I fed a magpie some chicken.

784
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And the same magpie visits me every morning.

785
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
And did I just hear the wind?

786
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Macaron panel.

787
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And I wasn't at my house yet.

788
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
So I had to keep walking.

789
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
And the magpie flew down right next to me.

790
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And I'm like, you still have a long way to go.

791
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
So I kid you not, I had an imaginary leash with this magpie.

792
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
And I was like, okay, come on now.

793
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And it would like follow me.

794
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
But then it would stop and look at the books and the grass.

795
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And I'm like, okay, a little bit longer.

796
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
And I literally like walked a magpie to my house.

797
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:47,000
And give it cashew nuts.

798
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
It's not gammy.

799
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
It's actually a male magpie.

800
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I don't know what to name him.

801
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
But he, oh my god, my heat just came on.

802
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Can you hear that?

803
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Sorry, it's really cold in Australia.

804
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
It's really cold.

805
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Name him Ray Flay.

806
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I don't know what to name him.

807
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
It's been really bad.

808
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
He says multiple times.

809
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Yesterday was a fluke.

810
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Plappy.

811
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I'm not plapping them.

812
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
What the fuck?

813
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
What do you want to use that for?

814
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Disney Princess?

815
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Well, fun fact.

816
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I have never, never been swept by a magpie.

817
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
But I have been swept by those fake magpies.

818
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
They're black and white.

819
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
But they're smaller.

820
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Magnus the magpie.

821
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
No, that's not actually going to be a new emote.

822
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
The emote is not staying.

823
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
It's just a temporary placeholder.

824
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I didn't realize but thanks to the gifted memberships

825
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I actually unlocked a new emote slot.

826
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
What about seagulls?

827
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
So, seagulls' peaks are so weak

828
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,000
they can't eat the cashew nuts.

829
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
But he put leftover food on the grass

830
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
and a magpie girl confirmed.

831
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Honestly, I'd entertain it.

832
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Sorry.

833
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Hold on, I need to read this.

834
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
For no particular reason at all,

835
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I need to read this too.

836
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Okay, sorry.

837
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Okay, I've read it.

838
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
For no particular reason at all.

839
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Okay.

840
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Yes, the magpies have an insane voice box.

841
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I'll do this.

842
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Is it, again, the sense that it makes me really happy?

843
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So, I can understand a magpie's calls.

844
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Like, there's three types of distinct calls.

845
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
There's the leave me alone territory call.

846
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
They always fight over territory.

847
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Seriously, they're always fight over territory.

848
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And you hear them meow, meow type thing.

849
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Oh, I can call them reef pie.

850
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
That's good to hear.

851
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Magpie feeders.

852
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I give them cash.

853
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I don't know why.

854
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I take a lot of satisfaction of feeding birds things

855
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
they would never get to naturally taste.

856
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
So, like, I feed them leftovers.

857
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I feed them chicken.

858
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I feed them cashew nuts and, like,

859
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
all these different types of nuts they never have access to.

860
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
But cashew nuts are their favorites.

861
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And I'll fucking listen to this.

862
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:16,000
So, I bought them solid cashews the first time.

863
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
And when I gave them unsolid cashews, they were raging at me.

864
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
They were, like, looking up at me like,

865
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
hey, what is this?

866
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
They were literally raging at me.

867
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
That I gave them unsolid cashews.

868
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
And I'm like, bro, bro, you're supposed to be healthy.

869
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I'm not only sending you to early grief.

870
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Wait, you're feeding a bird a bird.

871
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Magpies eat chicken.

872
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Now, they eat chicken.

873
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
They eat meat.

874
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
They don't bite it.

875
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I feed them, like, cheesy chips.

876
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I'd left over cheesy chips from HSB.

877
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Birds don't have the space thingy,

878
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:10,000
so they actually can't tell.

879
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
They actually can't tell if it's got spaces

880
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
so I can feed them a little bit of HSB

881
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
because I can never finish HSB, so I wonder though.

882
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Yeah.

883
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Wait till you learn what some other fish eat.

884
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Actually, birds only eat grass.

885
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
There's so much footage in the UK of seagulls

886
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
walking in air creeks,

887
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
grabbing a bag of crisps,

888
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:45,000
pulping it, and then leaving, like, absolute chats.

889
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Oh my god, I just said they're real, sister.

890
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Wow.

891
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
It is. I can't believe it.

892
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Wow.

893
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
A bag of wall crisps.

894
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Did you just hear my stomach?

895
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I guess I'm a bit peckish.

896
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Oh, one's got punched in the face by a seagull.

897
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
That one is your burger.

898
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Honestly, they're real less.

899
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Oh my god, are those the real reflux?

900
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I'm a big fan.

901
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
You're a fan of the reflux.

902
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Goodbye.

903
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Hear that, reflux.

904
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
You're popular.

905
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Not just by me.

906
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Strudy's still pregnant.

907
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Okay, birthing is more tempo.

908
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Yeah, I'm waiting for the challenge over the strictest on screen.

909
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Feel enter.

910
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Wow, I can't believe since sister doesn't stream on YouTube,

911
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I wonder if that'll change.

912
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Oh, thank you for the extended membership, Ali Viva.

913
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
You sent extra fair ale today.

914
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
You sent extra fair ale today, mommy.

915
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Thank you again for the great pregnancy.

916
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
You are so lovely, awesome.

917
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Oh, thank you.

918
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Seriously, everyone thought I was going to be a shimp,

919
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
but I'm not actually trying hard.

920
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
It's so much fun.

921
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Someone literally commented, you know,

922
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
for someone called Children Parasite,

923
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
you're sure to have a really loving and caring side,

924
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
and I'm like, hey.

925
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Imagine I could stream on YouTube.

926
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Imagine Strudy, don't mess with me.

927
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Oh, my God, imagine.

928
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Like, seriously.

929
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Imagine sending a step-by-step instruction

930
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
of how your 3D setup works.

931
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Imagine.

932
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Okay, I'm going to say something about since sister

933
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
actually did send me a video of her as I help,

934
00:58:53,000 --> 00:59:01,000
and she was like, she fucking spun around her rib

935
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
and I saw her give a chair.

936
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And she was like, ignore this way

937
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
when I gave her a chair,

938
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
because there is like a mark.

939
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And I was like, don't worry,

940
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,000
since I literally have a mark when I give a chair to her.

941
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Both of us are such fucking gamers,

942
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
and we were like,

943
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
we were like, no, both of us stream naked and stuff.

944
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I was like, oh, don't be embarrassed,

945
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
because I streamed both of us naked as well.

946
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Like, my fan nature is on the chain.

947
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:44,000
We're both just naked and stuff.

948
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Oh, my God.

949
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,000
My way, seriously.

950
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
So anyway, I just thought it's very important

951
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
that you all know that information, okay?

952
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
When we collaborate,

953
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
we're both going to be naked and stuff.

954
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
On your teeth, open your mouth.

955
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
On your teeth and chairs, honestly, though.

956
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
What combo did I just walk into?

957
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
The most coarse one, okay?

958
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Please, I need to link to the chair.

959
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
God, I wish I was a gamer chair.

960
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I really like the chairs.

961
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Tony sponsored by Givenchy.

962
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Are you kidding me?

963
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
They would literally drop me so fast if I told them.

964
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Like, I'd be like, oh, yeah, there's so much on this chair,

965
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
and I'm going to put my chair itself for now

966
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
that you've seen it, to be honest.

967
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I don't know how much I would bet.

968
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
You know what?

969
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I'm going to put in my offer, okay?

970
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
We're going to start bidding on sister's chair, okay?

971
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I'm going to say a hundred quid.

972
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Speaking of sponsorships, let them be out.

973
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Good, strong, you're 10%.

974
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Oh, give me that.

975
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Name a billion dollars like the final offer.

976
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Use good, strong, you're for 50% of your days.

977
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
300% doesn't work.

978
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,000
One day we'll be one collab on Newton and I'll be like,

979
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
wait, stop, that's actually a really good idea.

980
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I'm sorry, that is, what the fuck.

981
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Sin, I think we just figured out what game we're going to collab on first

982
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
because that's actually hilarious.

983
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And then we'll just, like, straight up just play called

984
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Stop Sin, what the fuck, that's such a good suggestion.

985
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Why didn't you come out with that, Sin?

986
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
What the fuck, that's such a good idea.

987
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
And then we have to, like, assure, like, nasty camera chairs.

988
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Search and destroy police.

989
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I'm going to be in your police.

990
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
We would literally, literally,

991
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
actually think Sin would actually win, to be honest.

992
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Can you not do that?

993
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Stop.

994
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Okay, so for those of you who don't know,

995
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
back in the college eight days, for some reason,

996
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,000
the terminology was run an arbor train on zombies.

997
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Okay, don't ask.

998
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
It's just, it's just the way it is.

999
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Okay, it's just the way it is.

1000
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Honestly, I think Sin will win because, um, um,

1001
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I just got an idea.

1002
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
She's an MLG pro, what can I say?

1003
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And then we'll start out with a five-kadeon.

1004
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Yeah, but us, because I used to fucking camp in corners.

1005
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Like, she's having me.

1006
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Okay, I used to use a Famous suppressor in the ghost park, okay?

1007
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And I had a really high KD, because I did support things like,

1008
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,000
I would do the UAV jammer, the UAV, and then a Blackbird,

1009
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
so all my teammates could help me kill people.

1010
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I think it was popularized by high-round players at the time.

1011
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Okay.

1012
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Yeah.

1013
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
You level camper, you look, I was really good at winning search

1014
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
and destroy all I'm saying is, I may or may not have had a hundred

1015
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
and like 20 win streak or something crazy like that,

1016
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
like a hundred a billion thingy.

1017
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
It was just actually so good.

1018
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,000
An MLG pro.

1019
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Camper.

1020
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
So yeah, what are you going to do?

1021
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I mean, refland now that you know I'm a dirty, dirty, long camper in college.

1022
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
What are you going to do?

1023
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I mean, now that you know that I'm willing to do anything

1024
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
to win that round for Matty.

1025
01:03:50,000 --> 01:04:02,000
We'll call you a bad girl.

1026
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
We'll make some smores while you get the kills.

1027
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,000
360 no scope spec, honestly.

1028
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
We're sure 360 no scope montage.

1029
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Honestly, I wish I had any Black Ops 1v1 member streams.

1030
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
But I'll do it.

1031
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I'll literally destroy all reflands.

1032
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
And over a fact, I can destroy your college and your Black Ops.

1033
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
But I can't, I'm worried we may not be able to do it

1034
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
with Sim.

1035
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Sim may actually outdo me.

1036
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I'm not good.

1037
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:41,000
The strategy is to be in face clan.

1038
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Okay, it's so over.

1039
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Okay, you'll destroy everyone in chess.

1040
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Oh, yeah.

1041
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
You guys have no clue.

1042
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
If he's strong, I remember you.

1043
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
That's true.

1044
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Obtaining face with the Obnak.

1045
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Sin and strong versus reflex.

1046
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Oh my god, I just saw that for the last time.

1047
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Did you do some of the chess version of this?

1048
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
What do you want to call that?

1049
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:29,000
And when that is over for you, you have actually the idea

1050
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
of getting a Kota, especially the Black Ops series.

1051
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Sorry, but you actually have no coverage.

1052
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Like, I used to win every lobby.

1053
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Like, I used to be a pub stopper.

1054
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,000
It's the Terranology, where you just dominate pubs and games.

1055
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
And like, if you spend all of it, it'll be different and stuff.

1056
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
I don't know though.

1057
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I just breathed out my ex-mom's controller.

1058
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
This is my stuff.

1059
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
It isn't working.

1060
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
It's got dust in it.

1061
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I just breathed in some next level chemicals.

1062
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I'm gonna die here.

1063
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I think they fixed the Call of Duty server, so I'm not sure.

1064
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Literally, I was like eight years old on that game,

1065
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
screaming to the mic like,

1066
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Hi, thank you for joking.

1067
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I promise I'm doing ASMR.

1068
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Oh my god, we should start our own Call of Duty clan

1069
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
and call it the Glam clan.

1070
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I'm starting the last week here, literally.

1071
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I was so excited again.

1072
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Do you need a jar of peanut butter or what are you doing with your life?

1073
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Obviously, missing the braided jelly.

1074
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
We can feed that in Cougar.

1075
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Is that too loud?

1076
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I'm like, try not to do that tonight.

1077
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Call it a salty splinter.

1078
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
We'd call it if we're gonna play what we tell them,

1079
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
we tell them things together.

1080
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,000
There might be an opportunity to play with me at the same time.

1081
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
The grief links.

1082
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Imagine an eight-year-old Scottish girl thread

1083
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
and your bodily harm also tripling your grief.

1084
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Literally, I used to be called like a level boy all the time.

1085
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I mean, fuck, I still get it when I gave them a chance at lobbies.

1086
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
And they're like, what is this? We can do it.

1087
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:02,000
And I'm like, one fuck year into you suck, you go killed by me.

1088
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
When I played Call of Duty School 100, don't try me until April.

1089
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
I'll literally beat your record.

1090
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
120, correct?

1091
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Hi, hi.

1092
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Hi.

1093
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Thank you for telling me.

1094
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
You can't escape from Darko.

1095
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Okay, no, no, no. I'm not that kind of gamer.

1096
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Feel it back in, feel it back in.

1097
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I'm a level bad gamer, but Black Ops is the only exception.

1098
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
My record is 126.

1099
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Oh, did you lose? Oh, did you die?

1100
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Oh, see, I didn't, I never died at KDF5.

1101
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I'm not teasing him.

1102
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Well, I'm not teasing him, but I did have like a massive KDF5.

1103
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Oh my god, sorry, it sucks to suck.

1104
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Sorry, you're just not me.

1105
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I think that was Black Ops.

1106
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Oh, oh, that was an easy game.

1107
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Yeah, oh, oh, it is.

1108
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I'm teasing, yeah, I'm teasing you.

1109
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Now, Black Ops 2 was a hit in all hearts.

1110
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
It was fun.

1111
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,000
And then, the really underrated game mode was Alien and Concourse.

1112
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
And I'm so sad.

1113
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I never got the love it deserved.

1114
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
It was the perfect progression, that thing.

1115
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I'm so sad I didn't die.

1116
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Strony's toxic gamers, I can't believe this game.

1117
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
We need a Strony kind of mode.

1118
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
So, at least Strony extension.

1119
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Oh my god, I wish the ghost servers would come back.

1120
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I would set an extended extension, I'm not even kidding.

1121
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
You plan on making Black Ops 2 at least for the future?

1122
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I don't know, I would do it.

1123
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Clean, clean, clean your ears gently down the make.

1124
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
That was my stomach, barely, barely, barely, barely.

1125
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
I'm getting all the earwax.

1126
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
If my stomach can stop making noises, I'm running extreme every 2 seconds.

1127
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
That would be great.

1128
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Coming home from school, double HB247, you turn.

1129
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Oh my god, stop, you're making me.

1130
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Look, the power of Nostalgia.

1131
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
The power of Nostalgia.

1132
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Stonk's like Strony tracking us down because we ruined our KD ratio.

1133
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I will make that roleplay right now.

1134
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Sticks and stones, I never did the gamble once where you bet your money to win.

1135
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I think I did it once in a while, it was like a reason.

1136
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Because I was like, oh no, I'm going to lose my bet.

1137
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
And then ended up winning.

1138
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Black Ops ASMR soft warzone since.

1139
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
It's called Rage ASMR to fall asleep too.

1140
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
My favorite rifle, you think I use snipers, a Famous.

1141
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
And then there was the MSMC for Black Ops 2.

1142
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
And then there was the A911 or something for Black Ops 2 for long range.

1143
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Whereas like the Famous was just everything you needed.

1144
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
ASMR, Stonk's like small child.

1145
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
It means your KD, your code skills honestly.

1146
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I never died once after my brother told me the game.

1147
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Unlocking a cold gun to be able to change your contact color and all the emblems.

1148
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
The emblems are selling also in college right?

1149
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,000
You have 1500 hours in code ghost, oh my god.

1150
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I love extinction.

1151
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I loved like leveling up in it as well.

1152
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Because when you put on these things to make it harder,

1153
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:42,000
you go so much of an XP boost that you would like level up to the most basic thing.

1154
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Panging on the door.

1155
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,000
People in a Kenya in there open this door because you cannot windowson it.

1156
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
And this is what you deserve for breaking my winstry.

1157
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Can we say that's not my load?

1158
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Is that a load?

1159
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Did they fix the servers on code ghost?

1160
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Because if they did, I'm sorry but we're putting up extinction next week.

1161
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
If they fix the servers, I will play it.

1162
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Ironically, we can play extinction together.

1163
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I wonder if when Activision realized it could make bank,

1164
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
if they just made us all focused on zombie.

1165
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
There was a recent zombie game that came out,

1166
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
that rifle called, people said it was actually very cute.

1167
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Oh no.

1168
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Thank you.

1169
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Thank you for the extended membership when I played Call of Duty.

1170
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
My friends called me double, seven zero girls zero.

1171
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
This is seven turns.

1172
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I'm so sorry.

1173
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Bless your glowing socks.

1174
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Oh, I don't even know why I made that noise.

1175
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I'm sorry.

1176
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Does it kill your heart?

1177
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I'm not sure.

1178
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Fire alarm noise.

1179
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
My glass bubble.

1180
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
The bubbler.

1181
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
You're black.

1182
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
What the fuck?

1183
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
You can literally hear how pale I am in my voice.

1184
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
That's bizarre.

1185
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
That photo campaign is great.

1186
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Go ahead, Tokyo.

1187
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
It's the glass and the blubberer.

1188
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Oh my god, not to be a weirdo.

1189
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
They're like a fangirl or anything.

1190
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
But Nini literally followed me back.

1191
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
You know, like one of the biggest ASMRs ever.

1192
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Yeah, she like followed me back on Twitter.

1193
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
So, yeah, you can kind of say I'm a big deal.

1194
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
I'm not. I'm decent.

1195
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
But I was like, wait, what?

1196
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
She actually fucking told me.

1197
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Nini.

1198
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
That Vtuber Nini.

1199
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
From the Project Production Co.

1200
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
She literally followed me back on Twitter.

1201
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I'm like, oh, hi.

1202
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I love you. Please kiss me.

1203
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Kiss me.

1204
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
The way you said the blubberer reminded me of order.

1205
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
The blubberer, you were both a big deal to me.

1206
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Well, okay, I'm going to say something controversial.

1207
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
I thought, sorry, kissing ASMR, yes.

1208
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:40,000
So I thought that her management would prevent her

1209
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
from interacting with me.

1210
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
But I don't know.

1211
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Production Co.

1212
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I can't be straight now.

1213
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
I'm not going to lie.

1214
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I'm always surprised.

1215
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I'm like, are you allowed to interact with us yesterday?

1216
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I can get the responsible thing out again.

1217
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
We are.

1218
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
I thought that management would be my measure.

1219
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Unfortunately, we've had going a few experiences collectively

1220
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:36,000
where people aren't allowed to talk to us

1221
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
because we had communication stoppers.

1222
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
And I'm like, ah, okay.

1223
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:49,000
And it's like a shame because obviously it's like public perception

1224
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:54,000
and stuff, and it's very hard to be like, hey, we're normal streamers.

1225
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Because you're not going to expect an agency to sit down and watch it

1226
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
and be like, yeah, we're normal streamers.

1227
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
And we'll start to sense that that one guy and the change

1228
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
was responsible, but pulls her tongue out of her stomach.

1229
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
She exhaled her magma.

1230
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
So I guess this one's starting.

1231
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
My heart can only take so many lovely keys.

1232
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Yeah.

1233
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Okay, I'm going to actually take this squishy toy and tickle it.

1234
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Did you get the little ear bands put back on you?

1235
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Okay, so it should sound a bit...

1236
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
The HR will decide your feelings for me.

1237
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I'm HR.

1238
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I'm a little bit more normal though.

1239
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Migration check, darling.

1240
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Okay.

1241
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
I will use self-observe from eating mercy.

1242
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I won't, I'll just tell her to spare her back home.

1243
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Okay, there we go.

1244
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Wow, sorry, my fingers went in the chair.

1245
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
They're making noises.

1246
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
You stop that, Mr. Chair.

1247
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Record mercy being eaten, please.

1248
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Oh, I'll put that in his first don't-a-thon.

1249
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Since she wants to do it.

1250
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

1251
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Wow.

1252
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Okay.

1253
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Chair for him? No.

1254
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Careful, if you're too intense, you're going to make a sling.

1255
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Please wait until the praise of the chair doubles.

1256
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Feel her discard server.

1257
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
It's linked.

1258
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
It's notification only.

1259
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
You can't talk.

1260
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
It's linked on Twitter.

1261
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
On the pinned Twitter of the viewer again.

1262
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Imagine not liking this.

1263
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Or probably some people don't like it.

1264
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
As in, as in like this stream.

1265
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Wink, wink.

1266
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Let's not technical back there.

1267
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
It's decoration, okay?

1268
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
It's very fully sensed.

1269
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Thank you, Chair.

1270
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Silk salt comes out.

1271
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Imagine.

1272
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Real enter.

1273
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
It's from mine, okay?

1274
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Literally, like I sang away my room.

1275
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,000
And the person who made my room.

1276
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
He just stuck that on the wall and I'm like,

1277
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
you don't want, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1278
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
I'll take it, yeah.

1279
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I didn't ask for it back, I'll give it.

1280
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go.

1281
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I was like, it's an ASMR.

1282
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
It's a color fish that doesn't lose its color.

1283
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
It's really nice, actually, when you can work with contractors.

1284
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
When you can work with commissioners like that,

1285
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
where you tell them what the deal is

1286
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
and then they go, wait, how do you even get up there?

1287
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I just stand on the table to do it.

1288
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I disconnected.

1289
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Why didn't what's going on with my connection?

1290
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I disconnected twice in the stream.

1291
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
You'll take it where

1292
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,000
I record ASMR on my bed.

1293
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Bra, I disconnected again.

1294
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
I don't know what's going on as twice now.

1295
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Don't throw up, you flanks, it's okay.

1296
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I'm here.

1297
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Don't throw up.

1298
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Hypno content is going to be, forget your name next.

1299
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:27,000
There's going to be one monthly scripted hypnosis stream.

1300
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
I go halfway to throw it up.

1301
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
You force three seconds, feel our eggs morning,

1302
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
feel like morning, feel like morning.

1303
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I detangle myself and do like four or five times of ASMR to tinkle.

1304
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,000
You should consume it for a little while

1305
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
to make yourself more sensitive to the noise.

1306
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
We're halfway there in 19K.

1307
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Don't say such things.

1308
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Don't say such blasphemous things.

1309
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Please, I am in so much ASMR today, it's not even funny.

1310
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,000
I don't even have the time.

1311
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:11,000
When I finish this stream, I've got a membership watch along

1312
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
and then I'm going to go back to sleep

1313
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,000
and then I'm going to record my Patreon audio for tonight.

1314
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
And then tomorrow, I need to deal with the clipping program at VLR

1315
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,000
and then the day after, I need to do a mock-off

1316
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,000
as soon as Donathon and I need to come up with a trailer

1317
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
for her to record to get edited to advertise her Donathon

1318
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
and I am perishing.

1319
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
And then I need to go and edit ASMR

1320
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
and then I need to write a script for Amy and Mercy

1321
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
and I can't keep it.

1322
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I'll try to reach my own personal goals with content

1323
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:56,000
and I'm just a little bit stressed out.

1324
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,000
20K ASMR stream wins.

1325
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Maybe by the end of the month, I'm doing one hour offering for ASMR

1326
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:12,000
and then we do a show for ASMR.

1327
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
You've got to get some employees.

1328
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
There is going to be a manager earlier today,

1329
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
but at this point in time,

1330
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,000
if we need return on investment,

1331
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,000
I don't want to be hiring XYZ when the return on investment

1332
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
isn't going there, you know what I'm saying?

1333
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
What could help in getting real and true soon?

1334
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Soon, I will have the ability.

1335
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
But that's not right.

1336
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Can you still hear the kisses with the earmuffs?

1337
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
You could have hired an hour to do it just like that.

1338
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Have you been watching the Olympics?

1339
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Sadly, I don't have time,

1340
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
but I hope it's going good for your country.

1341
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Good luck to your country at the Olympics.

1342
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Coming to a blue twitch near here.

1343
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Okay, that was smooth.

1344
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Has your country won any medals yet in the Olympics?

1345
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Do you need help? It's fine.

1346
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:41,000
I like trying my best everywhere, all at once.

1347
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Okay.

1348
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,000
I don't even know where my country is going.

1349
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Today, I don't want you to be either

1350
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
maybe at the Olympics.

1351
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Are you gambling?

1352
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Let's go gambling.

1353
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
You're doing great.

1354
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
I really love your ears.

1355
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Yeah, did you like being in my U.S.?

1356
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Was it fun being in my tummy

1357
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,000
and listening to all my little tummy sounds

1358
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
and my heartbeat?

1359
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Yeah.

1360
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
And then all the cuddly sounds

1361
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
when we had a nap together at the end.

1362
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Or was it the thigh cupping

1363
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
where I literally squish you with my thighs?

1364
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Squish, squish, squish.

1365
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Squish, squish, squish.

1366
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Oh, my tummy is sore.

1367
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
I can't believe it.

1368
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
I believe I have this thing called hunger.

1369
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,000
But don't worry, I'm going to eat in the vibration stream.

1370
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,000
I lost all the brain seat.

1371
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
That's why we don't cap up.

1372
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I had to learn the hard way on the outro.

1373
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Okay.

1374
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Wow, wow, wow.

1375
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Another five key and stop.

1376
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
This is how you lose that freaking height.

1377
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
It's a drool.

1378
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
We live in a cardboard box.

1379
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I got knives back.

1380
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
We won another take.

1381
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Okay.

1382
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I could technically do wooden ASMR

1383
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
but I'm going to do wooden ASMR.

1384
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I'm going to click a little bit.

1385
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
I can't but worry.

1386
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
I'm going to click a little bit.

1387
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
I don't want you to click.

1388
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Do you understand me?

1389
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Two pieces of wood.

1390
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
You're not to click.

1391
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
You're just rotating and stopping.

1392
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Okay.

1393
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
You're picking with these.

1394
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I'm dry-harding.

1395
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
intravenous case would start.

1396
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Well, you're getting swallowed.

1397
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Is that your heart?

1398
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Do you want to hear my heart in a minute?

1399
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
80% of cap was given.

1400
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
No, stop.

1401
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Stop.

1402
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
I actually wanted to do a parody ASMR

1403
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
of girlfriend encourages you.

1404
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Like, you're going to...

1405
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
I can't remember what it was.

1406
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,000
It's like a...

1407
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
basically encouraging you to camp or something.

1408
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
I can't remember.

1409
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
I'll remember, sorry.

1410
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
I don't know.

1411
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
What do you mean?

1412
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Get like four hours or so?

1413
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Was it three hours?

1414
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
I think it was like three hours by the time I fell asleep.

1415
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
You're like the wooden picks.

1416
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
These are... these are... okay, so...

1417
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I'm quite the resourceful little raccoon, okay?

1418
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:43,000
These are my Chinese and East chopsticks

1419
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
from our restaurant.

1420
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
So it's just wooden.

1421
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
And like you can hear when my skin

1422
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
brushes against the wood as well.

1423
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Okay, you can't look at ASMR at all.

1424
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
It's like... it doesn't make any sense.

1425
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Yeah, like ASMR, it's supposed to be a meme,

1426
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
but I don't know, sometimes the campus

1427
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
topic is crazy and stuff.

1428
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,000
And I don't want to upset anyone.

1429
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
I'm just a streamer.

1430
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I stream my life away.

1431
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Away.

1432
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
ASMR is trying to slushy.

1433
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,000
I mean, that's where the four words are going to be called.

1434
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
And...

1435
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
You've seen that color version real life, have you?

1436
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Was that cute?

1437
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
I'm so sorry, my hand kicks on.

1438
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
It's very cold, it's very cold

1439
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
and I don't want my cats to be cold.

1440
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Because I love my baby.

1441
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
He's my little friend.

1442
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
I love my babies.

1443
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
My little furry babies.

1444
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Hello, thank you for hanging on stream.

1445
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
I'm just...

1446
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,000
I'm currently picking away at your ears right now,

1447
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
actually just making sure they're nice and clean,

1448
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
but maybe careful that I don't touch the inside

1449
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
microphone part because if I do, then it's all over.

1450
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Call incoming.

1451
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
It's time to hang.

1452
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Also, if I'm using a wasteful of child support,

1453
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
probably you spawn that thing.

1454
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Wrap your willy-meat.

1455
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
If you spawn that, you won't be fruit.

1456
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Chopsticks, it sounds like an enemy.

1457
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
This time, I was reading in Karnia,

1458
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
and it does a Chinese thing on it, like...

1459
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
I wonder if I can take your...

1460
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Can I trim on your ears?

1461
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
I have no idea what that sounds like.

1462
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Absolute rhythm.

1463
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
It looks like I've got a lot of chopsticks on your ears.

1464
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
You got mud on your face.

1465
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
You make this grease.

1466
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
You mean...

1467
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Yeah, I'm gonna piano your ears.

1468
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I'm pianoing your ears.

1469
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
This is the fastest thing that goes on the list.

1470
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Mommy, does the pongo cat mean one of your ears?

1471
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Oh my god, I should commission someone as...

1472
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
It's like my butt, but you're just refling

1473
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
to the pongo cat, my butt.

1474
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Any artist that can do that, hello?

1475
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Any artist that can do that, please?

1476
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I beg.

1477
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Yeah.

1478
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
The microphone is really...

1479
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Because I'm a...

1480
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
I mean, green.

1481
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Well, not really.

1482
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Because I've got big fat arms.

1483
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
But I love my mood.

1484
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Some people get really fast triggers

1485
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
ASMR, but I just don't always pay them.

1486
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
I don't like making fast ASMR

1487
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
because if someone's all open to ears

1488
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
and they're like...

1489
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
It's just annoying.

1490
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
I'm about crazy.

1491
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Maybe it's just a preference.

1492
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Okay, I'm brushing your ear a little bit.

1493
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Speedrun ASMR, like, yeah,

1494
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
like this fast ASMR speaker and stuff.

1495
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
And they're like...

1496
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good.

1497
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Like, I can't say it like this.

1498
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
And ASMR is like...

1499
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I'm like...

1500
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I'm not supposed to take off.

1501
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I'm literally just getting fairly slow.

1502
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
But I feel so fine.

1503
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Can't beat this.

1504
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I can't even bring up length, so I'm actually raging

1505
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
and watching back the stream.

1506
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
And to see if I was just being really bad at the game.

1507
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
And I'm like, no, that game's impossible.

1508
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Sorry about that.

1509
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Thanks a lot.

1510
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
ASMR's were just sleep fasts for a bit now.

1511
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Yeah.

1512
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I'm good with that.

1513
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Let's go gambling.

1514
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Oh, dang it.

1515
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Beat you with a fried bun is more true.

1516
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Yeah, but does the average reach you

1517
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
or do you break them with your ASMR?

1518
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
When you're the father?

1519
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

1520
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
There's a first time for everything, okay?

1521
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Fast ASMR only works with some deep oily ear massages.

1522
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
I haven't, not with them.

1523
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Can be blinks, but as a 5k deal,

1524
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
you can't look, okay,

1525
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
if you're to some latches on the server.

1526
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I'm sorry, but I'm actually going to start going on a round

1527
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
about blinks.

1528
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
I don't know who they think they are,

1529
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
but why on earth did I accidentally

1530
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
stumble upon the fucking dark souls

1531
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
of Expo's original games?

1532
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Because who freakin' made that game?

1533
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
I'm sorry.

1534
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
I didn't ask you to hit me.

1535
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
He saves the princess and all that.

1536
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Oh my god, you're playing hell divers.

1537
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Oh my god, they're all close to the left.

1538
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
They're diving down.

1539
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
They're going to get you.

1540
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Throw your name.

1541
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Go, go, call it.

1542
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Call in your logo today.

1543
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
It's up down left, left right up.

1544
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Okay, go, go, call in your name.

1545
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I'm sorry.

1546
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Girlfriend is here in your car, aren't you?

1547
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
If only we didn't get your kiss in the blink of an eye.

1548
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
I know, it's actually so annoying.

1549
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
I just, I don't know why YouTube doesn't know

1550
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
why anyone's bizarre.

1551
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
It's like, I don't know why they don't know about it,

1552
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
but I know we're just playing by force.

1553
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Just go with Twitch.

1554
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Ah yes, let me up my fan base.

1555
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
I've accumulated from two months of consistency

1556
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
straight into Twitch.

1557
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I apologize, but I can't do that

1558
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
because none of what you're saying

1559
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
is very acceptable to me.

1560
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I'm sorry.

1561
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
I'm sorry.

1562
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I'm sorry.

1563
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
I'm sorry.

1564
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
I'm sorry.

1565
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I'm sorry.

1566
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
None of what you're saying is very acceptable

1567
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
by Twitch's standards, so...

1568
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Yeah, I'm, I'm a big YouTuber.

1569
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Exactly.

1570
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Yes, like, keep looking.

1571
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Blinks versus Rogues.

1572
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Literally none of our designs are acceptable

1573
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
on Twitch, say...

1574
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Yeah.

1575
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
And no, I'm not redesigning.

1576
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Well, if Blinks was actually

1577
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
made by the same devs or so.

1578
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Honestly, I believe it.

1579
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
I honestly wouldn't believe it.

1580
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,000
If a director for the Dark Souls

1581
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
was actually secretly on Blinks...

1582
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Thank you for the good chat.

1583
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
I wish I had a banner on YouTube.

1584
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Has been gone already, though.

1585
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
And it's a little glitchy, so...

1586
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
I must say, it's better for YouTube

1587
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
because, at least, she has no personality

1588
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
after all this.

1589
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
And these are, you know, unfortunately

1590
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
operating dead, dead, dead.

1591
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
What?

1592
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Oh, it's not because of the video.

1593
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Yay, it's the banner on the IFC.

1594
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
I mean, fucking Fallen Shadows.

1595
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Literally, a perfect example.

1596
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
She had it on her list recently, as well,

1597
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
for being a...

1598
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
for visual content.

1599
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
And I'm like...

1600
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
No question mark.

1601
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Fallen Shadow isn't like that.

1602
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
You went from chilling.

1603
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Yeah.

1604
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Cool.

1605
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Yee.

1606
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1607
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Twitch is terrible for visual

1608
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
versus literally, like, one for a bitch.

1609
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
You want to be slainly different.

1610
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Is that as well?

1611
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
I

1612
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
I brush, I brush your ears

1613
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
to get them all nice and clean.

1614
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Clean, clean, clean your ears

1615
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
of all the dust and debris.

1616
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

1617
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Life is like a dream.

1618
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Wow.

1619
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Well, streaming sites have a hardcore

1620
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
when you're not doing these features.

1621
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
And features, as far as the views are concerned,

1622
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,000
support you to the end of the scoop.

1623
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
And yeah, if you're really killing it,

1624
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
everything is going to survive.

1625
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
And it's like, well, obviously we're not going to

1626
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
walk out for me, Wax, you know.

1627
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
I'm not going to get lonely for you.

1628
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
I

1629
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
I'm quite fine.

1630
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Yes, the one good thing about YouTube as well

1631
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
is I can dictate the ads in the stream

1632
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
and I don't put any ads on streams at all.

1633
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Like, YouTube prompts me

1634
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
every single time YouTube's like

1635
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
do you want to play an ad, do you want to play an ad?

1636
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
And I'm like, nope, nope, nope, nope, stop asking.

1637
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
But on Twitch it's forced.

1638
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
But at least on YouTube,

1639
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
I can stream up to an ASMR stream

1640
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:40,000
and it doesn't get interrupted with ads.

1641
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
It's just a shame that YouTube

1642
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,000
implemented quite a while back now.

1643
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,000
But they force ads on the end of YouTube

1644
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
videos before they did it.

1645
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Like, you could have an ad at the start

1646
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
and nothing else.

1647
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
But they completely took

1648
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
the ability away

1649
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
and now they force an ad

1650
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
at the start and the end.

1651
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
The only thing I can control

1652
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
when I upload an ASMR roleplay

1653
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
is if there's mid role ads

1654
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
in the middle of the video.

1655
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
And I take off by default.

1656
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Like, I take off because I don't want to wake you up.

1657
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Because, you know, they're playing

1658
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
an astronomically loud ad.

1659
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Like, you know, even if

1660
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
they were smart about it

1661
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
and did, like, volume control

1662
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
and did really quiet ads

1663
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
then, you know, maybe some ASMRs

1664
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
would go for the option.

1665
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
But because they insist

1666
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
on layeringly loud ads,

1667
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
it's absolutely ridiculous.

1668
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Twitch ads are forced and

1669
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
embedded YouTube is thrown into the...

1670
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
I think so.

1671
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
I will change in the future.

1672
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Unfortunately,

1673
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
so let's enjoy this

1674
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
livestream

1675
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
for what it's worth.

1676
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Because

1677
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
I don't think we'll always get this

1678
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
bass boosted

1679
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
on to the sound. What does it feel like?

1680
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
It feels like

1681
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
like

1682
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
I do some little ear tappies

1683
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
with my hands.

1684
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
YouTube will see how much

1685
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
the numbers can go up in game creation.

1686
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Literally, it's just

1687
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
infinite growth and

1688
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
nothing else.

1689
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
And I don't get involved. I want to see

1690
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
what content creators eat.

1691
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
You know, I'm a content creator too.

1692
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
It would be hypocritical.

1693
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
All I'm saying is that

1694
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
it's not necessary to have ads

1695
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
literally everywhere that

1696
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
interrupt the viewing experience.

1697
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Hello. Thank you for joining me.

1698
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
I'm Strani.

1699
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Hi.

1700
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
I mean, break-ins I guess.

1701
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Yes, it's literally

1702
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
creating the problem

1703
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
solution.

1704
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
I can

1705
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
set defaults

1706
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
so every stream

1707
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
I tell YouTube to prompt me

1708
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
to create an ad because I can

1709
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
dictate where it goes.

1710
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
But there's an option for

1711
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
auto ads and it says for the

1712
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
best viewing experience.

1713
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
And it's like, no, it's not.

1714
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
It's literally going to make people

1715
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
click off of streams.

1716
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Like, don't be so silly.

1717
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
The best viewing experience

1718
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
can have in here, honestly.

1719
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
I want to interact here.

1720
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Literally, me with a fucking break-in

1721
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
sample right now.

1722
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I'm obsessed with all the life in.

1723
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
You are going to love

1724
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Fauna then.

1725
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
She does ASMR and she's awesome.

1726
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
So don't be scared.

1727
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
And I think she's getting close to

1728
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
a million subscribers only.

1729
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
She's already hit a million.

1730
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Oh my god, she's going to get a play button

1731
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
for a million subscribers.

1732
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Hello, hi, hi.

1733
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Fauna sent me some ASMR in a minute

1734
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
but she does have a fantastic library

1735
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
of live streams

1736
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
and videos.

1737
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
And some of them are like, ever slow

1738
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
well.

1739
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
It's very busy, busy.

1740
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Very busy, busy to be on the library.

1741
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
If you do forces ads,

1742
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
just ask them for the ad bloggers.

1743
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
True unparthing ASMR

1744
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
is where I saw

1745
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
a book.

1746
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
I love you.

1747
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Love you too, love you.

1748
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Fauna bloggers.

1749
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
I was trying to fauna collab

1750
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
with this school.

1751
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
She has a adorable

1752
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
absolutely perfect accent

1753
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
and then I'm in the age

1754
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
who said go and launch.

1755
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Yeah, I don't think that's gonna happen.

1756
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Even as a day is more

1757
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
fauna as a comfy babe, yeah.

1758
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
I can't believe I missed

1759
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
my own children being bored.

1760
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Yeah, and yourself as well.

1761
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I can't believe that

1762
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
you didn't watch the video

1763
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
of

1764
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
of

1765
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
of

1766
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
of

1767
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
of

1768
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
of

1769
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
of the

1770
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Berry Kidsy roleplay on my

1771
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
YouTube channel.

1772
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Phil's call halfway through the club

1773
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
I'm wanting to do Phil's call as ASMR.

1774
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
I think I'm gonna do that nurse

1775
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
lace person.

1776
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Both of my parents are double part.

1777
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
How do you miss your friend?

1778
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I think feel her and be sure to

1779
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
we'd be big.

1780
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
I think

1781
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
we would have to be a bit bigger

1782
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
to get anyone's attention

1783
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
at that level.

1784
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
I'm gonna be honest.

1785
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
I can't work it

1786
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
slightly harder

1787
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
than I first imagined.

1788
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
I'll say that, literally I've been very

1789
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
like everyone's been so nice that I've reached out to

1790
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
so maybe I just don't need

1791
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
to be such a

1792
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
sorry, I didn't mean to pop.

1793
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Sorry.

1794
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
So

1795
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
don't do birth ASMR.

1796
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
No, I'm not gonna maybe do that.

1797
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I'm not gonna do birth.

1798
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Don't worry.

1799
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
I don't even know

1800
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
how you make that like

1801
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
you miss the baby making ASMR.

1802
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
He's gonna act as a nice face

1803
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
for us to

1804
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
follow the first Pokemon trainer,

1805
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
scrawny Scotland.

1806
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Literally the entire

1807
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
collab between me and Fauna has just been

1808
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
like member that thing with the English folks

1809
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
right there, eradicating the Scots.

1810
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
What do you think about that?

1811
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
What do you think about that?

1812
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Go on, go on.

1813
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
I think both ASMR is just screaming.

1814
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Literally, I'm like why would anyone want that?

1815
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Yeah.

1816
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Cheese.

1817
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
I'll do

1818
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
I'll do eating you next.

1819
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
I don't mind eating you.

1820
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Oh, dammel man.

1821
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Okay, I don't know who dammel man is.

1822
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I don't know.

1823
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Well, I'm gonna be honest.

1824
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
I'm slightly collabed in the web

1825
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
so personally, I don't know about the other girls

1826
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
but I am

1827
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
an over my head at this point in time.

1828
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
And I can admit it.

1829
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
I can admit it.

1830
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
This is happening in the reef,

1831
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
like up above that.

1832
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
What?

1833
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
So you're just never gonna birth this?

1834
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Are you stuck inside your family?

1835
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Yeah, you can become a rock, baby.

1836
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
A stone.

1837
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
You're gonna get calcified in my whip

1838
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
and removed, like a choumah.

1839
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
A nature themed one.

1840
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Oh yeah, easy piece.

1841
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
You could write that.

1842
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
I say facts about the ocean

1843
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
and the water and all the sea creatures

1844
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
and she does it by land creatures

1845
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
and the plants and stuff.

1846
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Ever since watching how to train your dragon

1847
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
as a kid I've fallen in love with Scottish accents.

1848
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Oh, hi.

1849
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
One giant kidney star.

1850
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
We're gonna be coming here tonight.

1851
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
The

1852
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Servant Deer.

1853
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Pretty much.

1854
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Okay.

1855
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Does anyone know

1856
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
if Shabee's coming online

1857
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
or did she have to cancel

1858
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
because we feel

1859
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
a lot of accents

1860
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
are in New York City.

1861
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
What are you talking about?

1862
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Joke.

1863
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
It's me.

1864
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Holly Quinzel.

1865
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Oh, I love being

1866
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
in New York for some

1867
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
hot dogs.

1868
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
She's

1869
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
planning her 10k

1870
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
in 10 minutes.

1871
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Okay.

1872
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
New York

1873
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
gen count.

1874
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Stop. What do you mean stop

1875
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
at Mr. J?

1876
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
I just love talking to my real old

1877
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
ending New York act.

1878
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
I am so sorry.

1879
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Absolutely terrible.

1880
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Not 10 minutes, 2 hours.

1881
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
I'll just read her.

1882
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Finally, your real voice comes out.

1883
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Exactly.

1884
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Oh, sorry. Exactly.

1885
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
I love

1886
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
the way

1887
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
people in New York

1888
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
um, I don't know

1889
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
where are we going

1890
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
to block the co-op

1891
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Mr. J.

1892
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Oh, thank you.

1893
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Thank you

1894
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
for the 10k

1895
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
in 10 minutes.

1896
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
I'm so glad

1897
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
that you

1898
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
enjoy

1899
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
my ASMR

1900
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
in New York

1901
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
to do.

1902
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
By the way, your models

1903
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
are cute as well.

1904
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Thank you.

1905
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
In a while, yeah,

1906
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
do you think it's cute

1907
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
and bouncy

1908
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
and my hair flows

1909
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
and my titties

1910
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
and the best part

1911
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
is

1912
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
my

1913
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
hair.

1914
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Ta-da.

1915
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Ta-da.

1916
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
I start

1917
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
at once.

1918
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
But not right now.

1919
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
But not right now.

1920
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
It's not going to be long until Mommy reaches 20k.

1921
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Wow, I need to start firing up

1922
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
my ASMRs.

1923
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Can we get J.C.

1924
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Calibre with your ash?

1925
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Ash is a little toward.

1926
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
You better be.

1927
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Wait, I need to.

1928
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Ash? Ash is a little toward?

1929
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
What the fuck?

1930
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
I can't do it.

1931
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
I can't seem to whisper.

1932
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
I can't seem to whisper, bro.

1933
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Sorry, I can't do it.

1934
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I am okay.

1935
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
I am okay.

1936
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
The darker model

1937
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
with the glowing contrast.

1938
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Yeah.

1939
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Wow.

1940
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Wow, wow, wow.

1941
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Can you change the speed of the head?

1942
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
No, but I am

1943
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
going to ask for it.

1944
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
I am going to get

1945
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
slow, medium, and fast hypnosis

1946
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
for my hair.

1947
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Man, your voice is

1948
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
so nice.

1949
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
I can see.

1950
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I can't read that one out loud.

1951
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Help me.

1952
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
She won't know.

1953
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Strawberry, yes, I am a cowlfish.

1954
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
I do hypnosis.

1955
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
But I normally do a bit more

1956
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
than just visual, okay?

1957
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
But yeah, cowlfish use hypnosis

1958
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
for hunting and defense techniques.

1959
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
I should just remember several of them.

1960
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Can we get some close breathing?

1961
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Unfortunately, no,

1962
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
because YouTube eats us.

1963
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
You can get far away breathing.

1964
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
I don't think I can reach that.

1965
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
I guess ASMR.

1966
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
How do you?

1967
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Oh, I need to take your collar off

1968
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
before the end of the stream.

1969
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Hold on.

1970
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Let me take it off.

1971
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
I don't want you to forget that you've got

1972
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
an important side with it.

1973
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Okay, I'm going to get your collars off.

1974
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
I have a distant breathing,

1975
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
but I don't have a tube.

1976
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Who has a tube on standby?

1977
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Put the short collar on nice.

1978
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Shiny to membership streams.

1979
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Stay up, yep.

1980
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
We're watching beauty and the beast.

1981
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Or I should do a pet play ball

1982
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
where you're the pet.

1983
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
He's a good boy.

1984
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Do you need a chain?

1985
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Give me your ball, little reflin ball.

1986
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
He's a good boy.

1987
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
It's you.

1988
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
You're a good boy.

1989
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Repairs.

1990
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Thank you for the super chat.

1991
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Brothers in Australia went up over

1992
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
my friends, but I need to know

1993
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
if I should reply because I want 600.

1994
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
I would keep the money.

1995
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Park Park, I want to pay people.

1996
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Oh no, you're going to get moss off.

1997
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
You be mean.

1998
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
We can't change chin rubs if we pay.

1999
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Oh, you get more than just chin rubs.

2000
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
I'm going to show you that one.

2001
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Wow.

2002
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
All in her nuts.

2003
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Take the money.

2004
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Okay, I will work on a pet play stream

2005
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
for the next public ASMR stream.

2006
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Pay the house while you're at it.

2007
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
This is about your way.

2008
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
90% of cameras stop.

2009
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Chat is frightened.

2010
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Chat is called the reflinx in this neighborhood.

2011
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
I don't really say chin.

2012
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Any ticklers

2013
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
need a firehawk.

2014
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
I know you.

2015
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Hold on, let me check

2016
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
that everything

2017
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
everything's cool

2018
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
when you're part of the team.

2019
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
But yeah, I would definitely

2020
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
be open to a stream

2021
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
where

2022
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
we do pet play.

2023
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Sorry, I said I don't care if it makes me weird.

2024
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
I don't care if it makes me weird.

2025
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
I'm doing it. You can't stop me.

2026
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
You had more army.

2027
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
You had more army.

2028
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Hold on.

2029
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Okay, I'm going to eat.

2030
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Of all the wise words I was trying to

2031
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
say,

2032
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
literally take your air nicks

2033
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
and play it safe with them.

2034
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Do you think the reflinx

2035
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
would be a snow bearer in a war?

2036
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
What?

2037
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Why are you fighting?

2038
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
There's all rings as in army.

2039
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Actually, you know what? That was my fault.

2040
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
My bad. My bad. That's it. The terminology of army.

2041
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
No, you're not going to be fighting anyone.

2042
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
The only thing you need to fight

2043
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
is that you also have to purchase more ink, okay?

2044
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
We don't, we lose

2045
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
to those guys.

2046
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
No, while in war, any

2047
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
fight in war, we win

2048
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
automatically against everyone.

2049
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
But we would have to lure them

2050
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
into the water.

2051
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Okay.

2052
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
If they don't get the signal, sir.

2053
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
We'll enter.

2054
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
We're going to war? No, I'm not sending you a war.

2055
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Then draw. I'm just trying every group

2056
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
except the retina.

2057
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
The world's strongest navy, truly.

2058
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Fight in reefing, on reefing

2059
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
violence, as someone mentioned.

2060
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
A space otterskin.

2061
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
I can take my egg for war

2062
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
even. Test of strong backs

2063
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
and we all

2064
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
engage hypnosis to lure them.

2065
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
As far as a giant test

2066
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
that would be in our army,

2067
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
it's not like she can swim to the bottom of the ocean

2068
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
with us. We're safe in the water.

2069
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
I have bone spurs.

2070
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Sorry, I'm all confused.

2071
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Mommy, aren't reefing abuse real?

2072
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Okay, I let the reef links.

2073
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
I am going to redirect

2074
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
into Shibi.

2075
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
And for those of you who are

2076
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
members, I know Shibi comes on

2077
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
in two hours.

2078
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Those of you who are members, I am

2079
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
going to get some food and then we're

2080
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
going to watch a beauty and the beast together.

2081
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Because I'm a little

2082
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
married and I love beauty and the beast.

2083
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
And I hope you

2084
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
have downloaded the old beauty

2085
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
and the beast, not the one

2086
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
with Emma and the

2087
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
coffee one, okay?

2088
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Could we win against a polar bear?

2089
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
I don't know. I feel like it's kind of like

2090
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
land versus sea. We're good on the war

2091
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
but we're not good on the land.

2092
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Thank you so so much for

2093
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
hanging.

2094
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
And then

2095
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I'm going to redirect

2096
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
into Shibi.

2097
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
I know she's two hours away.

2098
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Don't worry about it.

2099
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
She's doing a very fun heart rate

2100
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
show called her stream so do look

2101
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
out for that. I'm going to go get

2102
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
some food and then I'm going to pump back up

2103
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
in five minutes. Okay, love reefing.

2104
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Thank you so so much

2105
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
for hanging.

2106
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
And I'll see you tomorrow

2107
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
for some lake lord in the ranks.

2108
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Then I do star stream to members later

2109
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
if you're not normal with that.

2110
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
I'll make up with an insurance of lake lord

2111
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
in the ranks, okay?

2112
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Thank you darling.

2113
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
If you're not subscribed

2114
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
don't be shy to subscribe and like

2115
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
and you

2116
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
just go strutting for 10% off

2117
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
of your cameras I'm sorry.

2118
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
But I do ASMR streams

2119
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
every week and role plays too.

2120
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
I recently uploaded

2121
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
pregnancy.

2122
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Okay, goodbye little reefing.

2123
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Love you.

2124
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
I'll see you for the next ASMR stream

2125
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
where I treat you like a dog.

2126
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
I said what I said

2127
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
and I will stand on that.

2128
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Bye.
