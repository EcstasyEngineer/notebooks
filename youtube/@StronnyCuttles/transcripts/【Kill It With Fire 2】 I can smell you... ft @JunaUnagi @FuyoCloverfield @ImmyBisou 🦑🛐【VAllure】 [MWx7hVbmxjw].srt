1
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:18,640
Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Can you yell? How are our volume levels?

2
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,200
Mic test 1, 2, 3. Should we all just yell? Yes.

3
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,680
I'm so sorry. Did we peek? I don't know.

4
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:42,080
All right. Reflins are reporting. They're saying hi mom. Right? But is hi mommy equal that the volume

5
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,720
levels are good? Come on. You'll need to tell me. They want louder? All four are clear and loud.

6
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,880
They say that someone says all sound is extremely loud. But if we're all equally extremely loud.

7
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:08,080
It's surely even. Yeah. Put it down a wee bit. By a whole three or four decibels, I'll put it down.

8
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:16,000
You're welcome. Okay. Let me see. Let me bring up the girlies. Okay. I hope everything is good on my end.

9
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,800
Apparently I'm peeking really badly. But I don't know how to fix that. So I'll just wait.

10
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,800
I'll wait for next stream. Well thanks for the next one. It sounds fine. I just kind of lowered

11
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,120
you a bit on this story. Yeah. It's not fine for my stream. It's okay. Whatever.

12
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:44,160
Do you have a limiter on your microphone? The plug-in? Yeah. The filters.

13
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:57,520
I do. I do. I try to turn it off. Turn it off? Yeah. Why turn it off? Because for me what happened

14
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,600
back in the day when I was using limiters is it just made my voice like peak hard. Oh. Really?

15
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:12,000
Okay. Yeah. It's really weird. I turned it off. Yeah, a lot of us. Did that help chat? Did it make

16
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:26,160
it worse? Did it help? Did it make it worse? I don't know. If we think we can progress, I must demand

17
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:33,440
gunpoint. Everyone introduce themselves. Okay. Right. Don't point blank at me. Only I won't let the gun.

28
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:58,720
Today we are playing a game called Kill It With Fire 2. We have just completed the tutorial

29
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:06,320
which means that we can do campaign mode together. We have an assortment of tools to expel this ship

30
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:13,760
as we got abducted like moments ago and basically we need to expel. No more spiders. Spiders forbidden.

31
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,640
No more. No more. Spiders be no more. No more spider. Fuck them spiders. There were a couple of

32
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,440
spiders in the ship so if you're wondering why everything is a mess that's why. Yeah. Yeah.

33
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:31,680
We have to get rid of them. A couple spiders. Corpse is everywhere. Yeah. I do not like spiders.

34
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,240
I don't think any of us have played beyond this point so what happens after this is what happens.

35
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:47,360
No idea. Total spider annihilation. I'm sorry. What happened? I'm sorry. Oh god it's over.

36
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,520
Wait no more fire. I almost killed them because I was just lighting fire to stop.

37
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,000
Right. Okay. No more fire. I will use fire with purpose. I promise. I will use fire with purpose.

38
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,120
So are we ready to go out? Are we ready to go? Yeah. I'm ready. I'm at the hangar door.

39
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,560
Okay. Okay. Okay. The glowing one. So wait we are exterminators from space? I think so.

00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:45,680
No more spiders or objectives in this room? I mean aside from over here but. I think so.

66
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,120
We can come need one more bag for that. Okay we can continue doing this cheeky holy.

67
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,000
See if I have Scottish. That's what I always say. I was like Stranny keep speaking. I need to hear that.

68
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:08,800
I need to hear. I need to hear your voice. I was explaining I was like I don't really like using

69
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,520
slang too much in case people don't understand me but I can make my accent like super hard to

70
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:19,840
understand if you want. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Right all four of us are entered the

71
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,200
hangar. We're currently hunting the spiders. We've no got a clue what's about to whack them but we're

72
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,000
gonna get our job done and then we'll get our paycheck and we'll get out of here. Yes. Whoa.

73
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,640
My cup just exploded. No it's okay. There we go. Bridge and the hangar.

74
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,200
Is this one? It's okay. I could understand you. I think you could just speak how we want to speak.

75
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,800
Yeah everyone understood you. Don't worry. Yeah. All right this is my parents. This is

76
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,720
actually my real voice. I'm sorry I've been mucking about for three months with that voice. I can't

77
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,080
be offshore anymore. All right where's your Spillidosk one?

78
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,600
You'll see. Oh we need this assembler. I've just done fast travel somehow.

79
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:11,360
Collect audio logs. A refund says you're so good at accents. No that's just my actual accent.

80
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,760
That's not that I'm good. Right who wants to stand in the teleporter because I'm too scared.

81
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:23,600
I'll do it. It's over by me. I'm jumping up and down on the spot. If you come up,

82
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,520
I think this is a teleporter and before you stand on it. No I thought the teleporter was,

83
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:35,600
I thought the tele, oh okay. Where are you? I'm back home. Wait at the start of the map?

84
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,560
Yeah yeah. Oh it must be if you forget an objective and want to come back to do 100%.

85
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:48,240
Yeah. Yeah. Not the game devs being friendly. This game's early access. Like they've not finished

86
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,400
it but if the game devs are friendly like this, 10 out of 10. Oh and there's another one here.

87
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:02,560
I don't know how to turn on the c-powered conduit. Okay so we need to find stuff to fix the teleporter

88
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:10,000
right here. The big one. And I think we need to visit the other rooms. Yeah. Our objective is

89
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:18,800
debug the gate's power converters. This is a bit above my pay grade. This wasn't really what I

90
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,800
signed up for. I was just to do the spider killing. Okay. Oh I got an achievement. What did you do?

91
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:33,440
Solve a hard puzzle. Who did that? I don't know. Who did that? You solved the riddle? I guess. Wow.

92
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,680
I was just clicking buttons. Oh my god. What is this? I thought it was a key card maybe. It looks like a

93
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:50,880
but. Wow. Okay. There's other places that we can go that's not this room I think. Is there?

94
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,920
I think yeah there's another. Yeah. Data chip missing. We're missing a data chip. Oh wait we

95
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,920
have a data chip. That thing that- Wait wait you? That little data chip? I think it's on the floor.

96
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:12,720
It goes here. It goes where? I don't know. It looks like it. I don't know. I don't think this is it.

97
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,040
Let me see. Why is that thing lighting up? I got the data chip. You'll never guess.

98
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:24,320
I think. Nice. You got a data chip. Return to the terminal to activate this terminal. Is this the

99
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:32,000
terminal? Does everyone get access to that data? I would assume everyone gets access. Only the host

100
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,040
may perform this action. Amir? Click that screen. Your finger that screen right now. Go. Which one?

101
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:47,920
Up here. Up. Up. Activate. The big activate. The big one? Oh shit look. My sensors have detected

102
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:54,560
an abnormal concentration of spiders within a construction site. What? Known as Artois

103
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:02,000
Manor along with a human space fleet? Data chip real king. Look at me. Junna don't do it. Junna!

104
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:09,120
Wait what happened? My screen died. Junna like moonwalked into a portal and my screen went black.

121
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:10,160
one, two, three. Use the ladle to stir. I'm saving some for later. Where's the ladle? I'm stirring.

122
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:17,200
Oh Stranny has it. Stir it up. I'm stirring the absolute crap. It's actually working.

Call me Gordon Ramsay because I'm cooking. Not all ingredients are in this room.

126
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,360
Wait it's not just going to respawn. I don't know. That's not how the world works.

127
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,320
Cauldrons just don't respond. How to reset your cauldron. Leave the room close to the door behind

130
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,480
Oh that was really creative. I'm going to give them that right. I'm not going to mix it too hard this

131
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:23,760
time. Okay so we just need to have two fires. Okay so we have the two. Okay so we need an

132
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:30,000
Ivan noot and a butterfly wing. I'm assuming this is a noot eye. Or is this a frog eye? The only

133
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,440
alchemy experience I have is from Skyrim and this ain't like Skyrim. Okay I guess. Never leave the

134
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,120
label in the cauldron. Oh that's what I did. Oops not all ingredients are in this room. Oh we're

135
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,640
going to have to go find. So I think this is the bead on and we need the butterfly wing.

136
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,960
Wait where are you guys seeing the straw? Okay never mind I'm blind. They're on the wall.

137
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,320
Wait I'm an extinguished fire. Only two fires are on which we need. Yes only two we only need two.

138
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:08,160
There's just two don't worry. Never. I added more. Oh no no but only two are on so you're fine.

139
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,120
Okay no oh wait and then what the ingredients are in here. One small mushroom? Yeah I already I

140
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,600
already put in the. And the eye of a noot. You put in the. I put the noot eye and the butterfly

141
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,560
and the beetle in there but we need a butterfly. Oh a butterfly wing. Okay and we have to wait until

142
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:36,560
it turns brown. He at a boil. Don't put the mushroom. No. I thought you were supposed to be

143
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:42,480
in a witchcraft. What's going on here? Hold on a minute. I thought it was your lore. I'm sorry.

144
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:58,240
Are we doing a cheeky 360? Everyone out. Okay okay okay let me. Maybe we just let Junna do it.

145
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,160
She seems to get it. I'm like Junna's the smart one out of us. You're really good with all of

146
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,760
coming home. Let's really let her cook. Are you sure you're really free time as well because

147
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:17,280
god damn. I like cooking. Clearly. You're in your element. Okay so we have to do that and

148
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:29,360
it has to turn brown before we can add anything else. When. Watch it not work. And a little

149
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,320
mushroom right? And then what happens? Yeah. And we have to wait until that turns blue.

150
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:42,960
And then and then who wants to stir vigorously until it turns orange? As long as you don't hold

151
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,760
the ladle and I've not got any more. We have to wait for it to turn blue or unless I did it wrong.

152
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:57,200
No. I can't find the ladle though. Hello Mr. Ladle. I found it's right here. It's right here.

153
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,360
So you have to wait for it just to turn blue and then. Wait when's it going to turn blue?

154
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,600
I don't know. A boil. A boil is three flames. Is it on three flames? Yeah and there's three.

155
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:17,600
And I put that mushroom in so. Oh do we do it too quickly? Is that a spider's back?

156
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,640
Why did they make this so hard bro? I feel like this is actually really. This is like too many

157
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:30,320
cells for this. Can I go inside? The surf you want. Why are you boiling yourself?

158
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,640
So you can eat me. Oh the dining room got unlocked. Wow. And game's telling us to go elsewhere. God

159
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:46,720
damn you're kicked up. Like can we cook? Okay yeah we're just supposed to wait I guess but.

160
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:53,680
Right make it blue and then mushroom right? Surely. It's on for you. It's on for you.

161
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:59,120
It's on for you. Are you okay? Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. I'm shit. I'm shit. Where are you?

162
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:06,080
Oh no that's true. No wrong one. I think it's off. I think it's off. Did it die? I think so.

163
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,560
Is it crawling on? What is spinning? God damn break it down. Can you see that physics? Or is it

164
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:16,480
just me that sees that? I think it's just you. No it's break dancing for me on my POV.

165
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:27,440
Hit him with a ray gun. Oh it's hard. There's like a skull here. Is it moving? Yeah.

166
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:35,280
And the light was off so I torched it and now it's on. Wow. Maybe it's a secret.

167
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,960
Maybe it's a secret if you lay them all off. Totally an original idea. Not chat help.

168
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,120
Did the lucky charms help be honest? No totally not. Tell us the truth. Tell us the truth.

169
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:54,640
We'll get out of here. We'll come back to the witch's cauldron. Yeah. Oh. I opened the door.

170
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:07,680
Oh this is our challenge. Oh. Anyone? Oh I'm out of ammo. Oh my god. It blinded me. It just

171
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:16,800
went on my face. There's a shotgun over here. There's so much happening.

172
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:23,760
Oh my god. It's like Minecraft when you walk through the spider web. It slows you down.

173
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,440
Oh we can open this door too. Oh I need the vacuum sucker. There's a spider on me I think.

174
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,400
Oh I killed it. Hold on. My fire thing doesn't work anymore. What now? It's over. What the hell?

175
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,840
Oh we'll need to find more ammo. How do you get rid of the... Oh no you... Oh a teleporter.

176
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:50,160
Great job. Use the nearby portal to return to the vindicator. Oh. But we can still collect stuff.

177
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:57,760
Beat them up Juno. Oh no Juno. Fucking fire. Fuck em up. Beat them up. I think it's dead. Okay.

178
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:05,200
What's this? I'm just gonna lay there so... How do we get... How do we get more fire? The hell?

179
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,720
Juno's... Oh upstairs. Right. I don't... Yeah. No.

180
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,400
God there's so much. This game is humongous. Humongous what?

181
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,920
This game is far too big. I'm so sorry. I literally thought it was going to be like one

182
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:31,360
simplistic level. We have teleported to a different realm. We're on a spaceship that is about to go

183
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,680
back. How do I burn this down? How do I burn this down? Oh there's something else here.

184
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:46,320
I need to find more... Let us in. Let us in. No. So this door doesn't work. I want to shoot it.

185
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:55,360
It didn't work. Access to the bedroom and bathroom. Yes. For you. Oh for me thank you.

186
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:04,400
Oh I love it. I love it so much. Oh I'm romantical. There's more here.

187
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,760
Oh for me. Oh my gosh it's yellow as well. It's so cute.

188
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:18,640
If you guys come back down, there's a challenge thing. But Amy has to open it.

189
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,400
If you guys want to follow me real quick, come here.

190
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,480
Kill Smarter's a sniper rifle. Where's the sniper rifle?

191
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:39,360
Did anybody get a sniper rifle? I did. Oh Fire Emel. There's more Fire Emel here.

192
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,280
I don't know if anybody saw it. Where are you? Where are you? Here here here. Oh and

193
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Oh did you pick it up for all of us? No maybe you did it. I don't know. It only went to you.

194
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,320
Oh okay then I'm gonna get rid of the... Okay so come here come here.

195
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,360
I can't get rid of all of these.

196
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:17,920
Extinguish hallway candles while evading the spider statue. What are we playing like the...

197
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:25,440
How do we extinguish it? Is it gonna follow us? I don't know. Is this weeping angels with spiders?

198
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:33,280
Oh you do have to put fire on it. It's starting to get real. Everybody get ready. Everybody get ready.

199
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:39,680
I'm sniping it. Is it gonna start chasing us? I think so. Oh yeah there's okay. Oh extinguish them.

200
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:46,560
So we have to take the fire away. I extinguish too. I ran out of fire. Jenna you're actually

201
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:55,680
100 IQ. You like everything right off the bat. We did it. Is it weeping angel? Yeah it is.

202
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:03,280
I looked away and then it got me. We did it. Oh okay let me see. I'm already down with this situation.

203
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:10,640
Wait we did it? I literally did not 500 IQ. You died? That's okay. No. Wait are you dead?

204
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:19,200
You're alive. Can you not see us? Yes. I want to kill the spiders with the sniper rifles because

205
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:27,440
if you kill five then you get another date. Come here. I have one too. Oh you have one.

206
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,600
The thing works. I did have one. There's a skull here. Skull skull skull. Can I give? Light them up.

207
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,560
Light them up. I don't know where to find more spiders. I'm empty. I'm empty.

208
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:50,160
Yeah. Light this up. Yeah light it up. Yeah. What does it do? I have no idea. Open something.

209
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:59,600
Kill spiders with rifles. Right I'm looking for sputters. There has to be. Okay okay. There's a

210
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:06,560
pooter. I don't know how to find them. Wait here here here. There's a spider here. In the corner

211
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,320
somewhere. Oh it's in the clock. It's in the clock. It's in the clock. It's in the clock. It's in the

212
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,600
clock. Hold on. Hold on. I've got the rifle out. I've got the rifle out. Here get it. Kill it. Kill it.

213
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,000
Oh my god. That's a little pin. Give me the rifle. Someone give me the rifle.

214
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:29,440
How did you do that? Press Q to equip the rifle. Press Q to equip it. It should be like right

215
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:36,240
side middle. Did you kill it? No no. It's under the piano. Piano. Piano. Chair. Chair. Chair.

216
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:42,160
It's under the freaking chest. Okay red seat. Red seat. Red seat. Red seat. Double seat. Single.

217
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:49,920
Yes. Yes. Oh my gosh. I don't think we need a you don't I don't think you just zoom in. I think

218
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:56,960
it's pretty accurate. I guess. Maybe. We're all in a boat though. Okay. I'm out of ammo for my sniper.

219
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:06,960
This game. Okay. It's stuck. Oh there's another flame. Wait is this a the vent? Let me try to do

220
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:14,800
this. I've a newt. Stop it. You're turning the fire off Mr. Vent. There's an OSC. I don't know how to

221
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:27,200
turn the vents off. And a beetle. Interference. There's a morph spider nearby. Right. It's almost

222
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:34,000
something. A morph spider. Oh it's one of those big ones. Yeah that come from items. Oh no.

223
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,600
Are you a morph spider? Identify yourself right now. I'm so confused. Is this is this

224
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:47,600
the small mushroom? Nope. Have we done this? Nope. The mushroom is probably like a big shroom.

225
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,520
No. No. Really? No. It was a tiny one but now there's no more small ones. Did they respawn

226
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,800
every time we respawn in the cauldron? There's there's one right here. Is it is it one of these?

227
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:03,440
No. No. That's a bit regular sized one. So it's a big one. I think was I think what it was it

228
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,640
didn't turn blue once it turns. Oh wait. No. No. Actually you're right. Heat until it turns brown

229
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:16,160
then at the mushroom. Yeah and then yeah. Oh it says heat. Oh royal rolling. A rolling boil? Oh I

230
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:23,840
guess four is rolling boil. Uh does that mean put the flames back to on a simmer? No I think it was

231
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:30,720
like I had to put all four on. Okay. Okay. I'm ready to do some. Oh there is one. Okay get out. Get

232
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:40,560
out. I'm a I'm a spin on it clockwise. Okay we got this. We got this. Is it? Okay. Okay. I'm just

233
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:50,800
I'm a new Emily. Yeah. Stand back. Stand back. It says there's spiders here but they're all dead.

234
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,880
It's and no that's what I'm saying. Main says there's one right in front of me.

235
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,280
Yeah but they're dead. Yeah I don't know how to find them. They're pretending to be dead. All right.

236
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,920
Oh he's on me. Well if anyone wants to see the spider he's mine.

237
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,720
Got him. Yeah you're just you're just being the show. I mean it. Sorry.

238
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,160
That you got him 10 wax to go thanks. Is this what I supposed to do? Oh it's blue. You did it.

239
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,760
Is this what I supposed to do? Oh. No it's to turn orange. Is this what I supposed to do?

240
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:27,120
Bring to Rumble until it turns blue. Stir vigorously until potion turns orange.

241
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,440
Stir vigorously until potion turns blue.

242
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,640
Stir vigorously until potion turns orange.

243
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,440
Stir vigorously until potion turns blue.

244
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,080
Come on. Fang them up. Let her cook. Let her cook.

245
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,800
Keep going. Keep going. Oh my god. But don't leave the ladle in. Don't leave the ladle in.

246
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,400
Or else it'll explode. You have to stir vigorously but from the outside.

247
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:54,000
It looks like it's not going inside from my POV like you're just in 360s around it hoping for the best.

248
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:03,280
Oh like this. Okay. Row vigorously. How is this? How is it not?

249
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:12,160
Is it registered in that? I don't know. This one's just going crazy for me.

250
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,760
It's like this. Oh wait. No. Can you rotate it like the bottom of it to go in?

251
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:26,640
Oh I can hear it splashing so you are doing it. Yeah. Make it splash vigorously.

252
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,080
I like how it will stand back just in case it explodes again. We're like not trusting it.

253
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:38,240
I don't want to mess it up. How is that not done? Is this a prank? Are you being pranked?

254
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,360
I'm sorry. Does it need to be in the cauldron? I feel like it might need to be in the cauldron.

255
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,880
Stir vigorously until it turns orange. It's in the cauldron for me.

256
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:57,760
Ball potion with E. Who was the ball? Oh my god. Firmly compressed it.

257
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,160
I got spider potion. It's like a new one. We've got grenades for scooters now.

258
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:13,120
Where is it? Oh spider potion. A new thing opened. Yay. I'm more confident. Nice.

259
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,440
That was so hard. What are you doing with the spider potion though? I think it's a grenade.

260
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:25,920
Oh my god. For you. What have you done? Get a spider.

261
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:32,080
Everybody please grab this clue. Don't do it. Please don't do it. She's so tiny.

262
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:42,400
She's so cute. What the? Oh there you go. Oh you're back. I'm just touching this potion again.

263
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:50,240
Are we supposed to go in the vents or something for that? Oh maybe. Oh that's so smart.

264
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,840
Wait hold on. I'm chugging. Don't mind me. I'm off. Go in the vents. How do I jump on a wall?

265
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:03,440
What? It looks like it worked for a second. Oh. Oh I didn't. Wait can I go again? What about the

266
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:13,520
bigger one? What about this one? What's this? Heavy ammo. Ammo. Ammo. I can't go back to being a wee

267
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,320
spider again. Doesn't really do it. Oh wait. I tell the lies right. Excuse me. I'm off.

268
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:26,640
So like can you can you go refill the spider potion? I assume. I can lunge apparently. And then I can

269
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,160
What is this? Oh wait. Can you go? Wait wait. Stroney come here. Can you go here?

270
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,080
Can you go in through here? Wait. There's a phone. Oh the bathroom. Oh fuck. Yeah.

271
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,560
Can you go in the bathroom again? Hold on. Let me try. Everyone there's a phone and it's shining.

272
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,080
Take it. Oh there's a timer. Hold on. There's a timer but I know exactly what you mean. I think

273
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:53,840
I'm going to open the door from the other side. Someone says accurate leprechaun size.

274
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,120
Reef land. Nice. Oh yeah this was it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

275
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:06,560
We did it. We did it. I got it. It's like I can't. I can't open the door. There we go.

276
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,200
Oh there's a spider in here. Come here. Where? It's on me. I just throw a nail gun at you.

277
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:20,560
You'll be fine. You'll be fine. You'll be fine. It's on me. Okay. Okay that one.

278
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:29,040
Oh there's different types of portions we can brew. More? I may have broken that. It's shining.

279
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:37,840
Oh. Do we need to say we spin again? We're different types of things. We need to access the bedroom.

280
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:46,880
Okay there we go. Where's the bedroom? This one? There's no hole in to get inside though.

281
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:55,760
There is the. There's the. Whoa. Oh there's a more spider. That was who was in this area.

282
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,040
Stop it. Spank that naughty spider. It's got so much vitamins in it. He's so healthy.

283
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,840
It's got what? Vitamins. Vitamins. Oh how'd you say it? Oh right.

284
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:13,840
Lay their souls to rest. What does that mean? Kill all the spiders. You mean the skulls?

285
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:21,200
Sanctity of the skulls? Huh. Sorry. I should have said flintstone gummies or whatever they're

286
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,800
called. That's right. I'm coming for you big flintstone gummies. I'm calling you up personally.

287
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:34,640
Oh. There's another one. Oh the shiny stuff. Bring them over to the people. Yeah. Oh the shiny

288
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:41,520
stuff here. Oh wait. Shiny. Bring them over to the people. Oh it's an offering. A tube of glue

289
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,760
and uh okay so we need two more shiny things. Uh huh. Uh where did this one goes here? There's

290
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:54,640
one kind of scattered around. How do we go outside? I've got a teapot. I don't know. Probably we have

291
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,360
Is anyone brish by any chance? Is any of them brish? Where are the other shiny things for y'all?

292
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:09,440
I don't know. I only found two. Or these two? Yeah. Okay hold on. If they were on this table then

293
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:16,000
yes. Wait only two. Okay. We need sparkly things for the momentum worry. Sparkle. Sparkle. Sparkle.

294
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,080
Sparkle. What is this? Right be a magpie. Sanctity and shiny. Sanctity and shiny.

295
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:31,200
We're all these people on the picture. They're the people who used to live in the house

296
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:39,120
for them. Did the space eat them? Probably. Maybe. They're vicious.

297
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:50,720
We need to find more sparklies. Shiny. Shiny. I'm having. How did you find two shinies in a row?

298
00:40:51,680 --> 00:41:03,120
I don't know. I saw shiny. Because she's a leprechaun. Oh that real? Real. Her grubby little hands.

299
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:13,840
They're webbing me. They're webbing me. Where is it? Replay challenge. Absolutely no. I'm not

300
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:19,520
doing the weeping spiders from doctor. Maybe it could be inside of some drawer.

301
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:28,160
Maybe. Is it just me? Or the color is turning black? I think because we burnt it. It's because

302
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:37,040
we burnt it. Can you manually destroy cobwebs or does it have to be with fire? I think it has to

303
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,760
be with fire. Oh I think it also works with the, oh no never mind. I thought I could back you.

304
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,240
It's not working. It says there's a more spider right here. What the heck? Wait no, it's gone.

305
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:56,240
Maybe I'm behind something. Oh. Can I still turn into a spider? Yes. Come over here. Come over here.

306
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:06,560
Oh wait. I found the bedroom I think. I found the bedroom I think. Oh my god you are smart.

307
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,880
Is that another sparkle? It's up here. It's a hole. I drink. In the ceiling. Go go go.

308
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,840
You do. Foo you. Foo you. Foo you. Open the door for us. Go go go. Let's go. Oh is it?

309
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,480
I can do some sick jumps. Didn't you see that? You're getting some air. I'm not going to lie.

310
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:32,240
You're getting some air time. Yeah. Oh why did you jump off from the, oh.

311
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:41,360
Okay. You turned it into a human and jumping on the table was so cute. Oh my god. Wait why

312
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:48,960
does it cool down? Hold on. I'll try it. All right let's go. Go go go. You have to aim up. Oh

313
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:58,400
fuck oh. Am I going to get a shot? Sure. How do I do it? Number six. Number six.

314
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,400
Number six doesn't press Q and find the potion. Oh sorry. My number six. Okay.

315
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:11,760
Oh spider. Oh wait. Juna's going for again. Juna. Go Juna. In me. Juna. In me. Juna. Oh you have.

316
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:18,880
The first spider to get it. Wait. How do I jump? Oh you're a human again. Climb up walls?

317
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,120
That's so stupid. Wait only let's you like leap on the wall no more. Honestly thank god they can't.

318
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:36,880
What? Oh wow it really doesn't let you do that. What? How are you so there's another

319
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,560
game mode in this game where you like be the spider and hide from each other but we decided

320
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:50,240
to do the campaign but this is. I did it. Let's go. Let's go. Right. Can you open the door?

321
00:43:51,200 --> 00:44:00,400
I think so. Hello. Oh my god. Hold on I'm directionally challenged. How did you make it there?

322
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:09,520
Up the stairs. To the left. To the left. I need to find one more shiny thing. More spider.

323
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:15,920
Beat him up. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Okay. I think it's dead. One more for good luck.

324
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:24,560
Another one. Oh wait. That's Juna. Okay. Wait does Juna count if we kill her? If we kill ourselves

325
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:33,200
with spiders? No. No. No. No. Maybe. No. It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

326
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,080
I need one more sparkly thing. Spider shaped.

327
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:48,480
And one in here. Dove it. Okay. Are you going ore? No it's a broom. Oh it looks like an ore.

328
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:58,080
Whoa that that is that looks like an ore for me. Oh. Spanky. There's a wrench. What's in here?

329
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:07,120
A weapon. Was the wrench sparkly? Money. Space box? There's currency.

330
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:18,160
I can't even see anything I'm webbed. What is that? Holy shit. It's a flint but it's spider shaped.

331
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:25,440
They go as they'll put it on the bed. They prank me bro. No. No. No. No. I'm destroying everything

332
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,880
Do you like the taste of that potion? Yeah I really do trust.

333
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,160
I need to find the last shiny. Yes. Oh yeah suck me for you.

334
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:45,520
Yeah. Does that intimidate you? Yes a bit.

335
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:58,880
Oh you need four potions? Oh you need four potions. Yeah I don't want to make more though.

336
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,240
It says needle drop. Play it again exterminator. What is that on the objective? It's on the other

337
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:12,240
page of the objective. How do you play it again exterminator? Was it this room?

338
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:23,600
Needle drop. Maybe it's the um. There's a record player here. Is it? Is it shiny? It's not shiny

339
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:38,640
but I look shiny doko. I keep accidentally drinking it. It's like second nature now.

340
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:48,480
I ironically did not make this easy. That's called an addiction Juno. Addiction. Oh I don't know what

341
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:56,960
how to respond. Do we have to go back to the potion room to make more potions? Yeah like the same one

342
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,280
over is. Can you do the same one over and over and over and it might count? I think it has to

343
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:08,480
be different ones. Does anyone have rifle ammo? Upgrade module? Oh wait I do.

344
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:15,120
Because we still have to kill spiders. We still have to kill former spiders with the rifle. There's

345
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:22,000
a spider here. There's one here on the chest. Strony look for Strony. Strony's tracking it. Beep beep

346
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:29,040
I'm following it. It's on me. It's on me isn't it? Shoot it. No it's here. It's here. It's on the floor.

347
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:36,560
It's on the floor. It's on the floor. Wait where did it go? Red cheer? Behind you.

348
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,560
Where would we find more recipes? Yes fire ammo. Did you get it? Okay nice. Yes three more left.

349
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:51,920
I assume they're going to keep responding. Hello hello. Wait do you guys have any idea

350
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:58,320
like where to find more recipes? In a book? There's a more spider in Juno's room to the

351
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:06,800
right somewhere. If you want to snipe it with a sniper it's like where? It's somewhere here.

352
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,560
It's teasing. It's teasing. Is it up here? It may be up. It may be up.

353
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:21,760
There he is. I got him. Oops he's here somewhere. There he is. Oh he's on me. Okay can you scope Juno

354
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:29,360
without taking her head off? I got him. I got him. I got him too. I got him too. Oh nice.

355
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:37,600
Nice. There is another job. There is another one as well in here because my jammer's still blocked.

356
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:44,000
Who is it? It's not random. You just smack everything. Literally I'm just touching everything.

357
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:51,360
Is it under the floor? I mean under the chair? Oh it could be. I found it. Oh right. What the?

358
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:57,840
Snape that motherfuckers. Snipe it. Oh he's stuck in here if you want to touch it. Touch it?

359
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:04,480
Yeah. And then there's one more behind us here somewhere behind the chair. I only have one more

360
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:13,680
bullet. No pressure. Oh no. I found it. It's on. It's on Emi. Can you snipe it with that?

361
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:20,880
Do you see it? It's on my face. This is one shot. It's on your back. It's moving a lot. Hold on.

362
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:29,360
Show me. Hold on. Hold on. Come on. Hold on. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move.

363
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:38,560
Kill me already. Oh my god. Yes. For you. That was amazing. Holy crap. Last freaking bullet. You did

364
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:45,040
it. That was amazing. Oh my god. We can unlock something now. I don't know what but something

365
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:50,080
on the map's not being unlocked because of that. Let me see. Oh not that we have to find. Maybe we

366
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:56,160
have to like light up all the candles quickly so that the thing doesn't shut them off. It's just

367
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:04,000
more compoundics. Oh. Oh wait with enough compound we can go outside. Oh to go up. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe

368
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:12,240
that's where the last shiny thing is. Yeah maybe. Here. Here. Here. Here. Oh wrong one. Where is it?

369
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:18,240
I sort of forgot. There was like a seven one somewhere. Oh. Is that bake following us? Am I going

370
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:26,080
crazy? Who is what following us? Wait where did you guys find the thing? The photography thing?

371
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,520
I don't know who but it wasn't me that found it. Oh I found that one. I found that one. You did? Yeah.

372
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:37,760
Okay so we're just missing one. We're just missing one. Yeah. No he goes in this

373
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,360
because he's an explorer outfit. That tricycle is moving. I'm not being funny. That tricycle's

374
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:48,960
moving. I don't need chocolate. You're right it is. That's fine. You guys are going crazy.

375
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:56,160
No it's totally moving. If you look away. I look away from the tricycle. I want to play a game.

376
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:01,120
Okay look in the way. Yes see. See. See. I told you I wasn't going mental. Okay okay stop looking at

377
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:06,560
it and just let's just see where it goes. I think it just tries to come up to us. It probably just

378
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:12,960
follows you. Oh my god it's right in front of you. Wait okay I'm sitting on the table as well.

379
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:19,440
I'm scared of that. I'm looking all the way but I'll be on the table. Where is it? Okay I'll look

380
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:25,520
away. Is it gonna take us to like some shadow realm if it touches us? Oh it's soft moving.

381
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,440
It's soft moving. I wonder if we're too close. It probably just follows us. Yeah we might be too

382
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:38,000
close to it. It just wants to play. It just wants friends. It's freaking moving while I'm looking at it.

383
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,600
It doesn't even care. I swear. I swear there was a room that was like you could open it once he had

384
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:48,560
like seven maybe. Oh it's I've got a twelve one here at the ball.

385
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:58,880
Is there any more holes in the ceiling that we can spider into maybe? Oh maybe maybe maybe.

386
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:08,480
I don't know what to do. Also does anybody have a way to remove like planks from the walls?

387
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,760
I don't know. It only lets us grab it when the nails are on the other side like if the nail

388
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:19,040
if you can visually see the nails I don't think we can take it. I see I see. Wait we have to play the

389
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:27,920
record? The record? Oh we got please hand hold please stream snipe please. Someone just said oh

390
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,920
nobody played the record yet. Wait hold on there was a record upstairs I was touching it.

391
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:39,680
All right I've got a record. Did we complete the challenge for sure? I don't think we completed.

392
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:48,160
Are you ready for some tunes? Yes. I got an achievement for that. Did it do anything?

393
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:57,200
Maybe we unlocked something because it said needle drop play game complete. Morph spiders around.

394
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:04,080
Yeah I'm gonna smack everything. Is that blocking us? It is who?

395
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:13,040
Who? Butterfucker. Wake up where the fuck are you? Literally we're smacking the absolute.

396
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:19,280
I said I'm becoming a spider and looking for the damn thing. Oh oh Mr. Spider. Where is it? Where is it?

397
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:28,080
Don't you know what some of this? Don't you want? Ow don't spank me. Don't you love my luscious eight

398
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:33,520
legs? I bet you want to get all up in that and use it. Maybe we can hear it. We'll make a little

399
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:42,960
nest together and then I'll eat you afterwards. You think you can eat all of me? All seven foot of me?

400
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:52,000
I can't find it. Oh maybe it's under the table. I'll become a spider. We still need to lay their

401
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,560
souls to rest. Yeah we need to find one more. Right there's not an under the table as well.

402
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:03,280
Where the heck is this Morph spider? Are you guys sure it's not upstairs? Because there's like a

403
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:08,960
question mark. Oh what happened? Oh sorry I went through the portal. Should I bring everyone? Yeah

404
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:14,720
yeah but don't worry. Oh I'm sorry! I thought you were just being weak. I don't think we lost any

405
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,400
progress. Welcome back. How do we go back there? With the recovered data ship you can now open the

406
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:30,400
portal to dimension lambada. Oh is it lambada a dance in Spanish or something?

407
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:42,000
I'll show you the lambada. In Portuguese that means like a punch like a slap.

408
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:51,360
Oh it's violence? Okay yeah it's violence. Oh no violence. There's a Morph spider somewhere here.

409
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:01,920
I wonder if everything's fixed or it's like so trashed. It'd be easier if it was fixed.

410
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:10,320
Where the fuck are we? We're giants? We're giants?

411
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:27,600
Oh my gosh. Giant test pros are winning right now. Holy moly.

412
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:36,480
Holy moly. Oh my god. This is my canon size by the way. Real and true though.

413
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:46,400
I remember when you came out. I love killing spiders. You can destroy the buildings as well.

414
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,440
Like straight up destroy them. That's so mean. I just removed the light poles.

415
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:04,160
Wait where's the spirit boat? No come back here. I saw you. Is that a mine? I'm in the mine.

416
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:11,520
Is there a restaurant on the side? Is there a restaurant on the side?

417
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:16,880
Someone sniped that whole air balloon. I'm shooting at it. Oh no.

418
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,840
I actually killed it. I didn't think they were going to actually. Wait what the heck?

419
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:33,600
Why is this so funny? The straw and zilla. That's so good. Oh my god. They're in the ground.

420
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:41,360
They're in the vents. They're in the hell. Get them.

421
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,640
Oh there's a pizza delivery guy. Pizza slider. Pizza time.

422
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,040
Hold on. I'm checking the radar. Oh wait this part is open.

423
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:06,960
What is this? I see it. I killed them. I'm so bad. I can smell you. Whoa. Hello Juno.

424
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,040
I love clean. Wait extension surgery. Is that what we got? Open hydrants.

425
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,800
We got our kneecaps broken and then like. How do you open hydrants? How come it's extended? Oh.

426
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:25,200
How come there's so many scooters? You're on the bottom. I'm going to go from a mansion to this.

427
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:31,360
I don't know. Open fire hydrant. I don't know how do you open the fire hydrants?

428
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,720
You press E on them. It's time to stop.

429
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:44,080
They're like screaming. I feel really bad. It's a stop sign. Do you see the stop sign?

430
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:51,600
Can you guys hear them scream? I feel really bad right now. Where's the stop sign? In my hand. In my hand.

431
00:57:51,600 --> 00:58:04,640
I can't see the stop sign. You can't see the stop sign? I can't see the stop sign. It's right here.

432
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:13,200
I'm drowning all the spiders right now. Oh. How do you drown them? You go their cars in the water.

433
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:20,720
Oh yeah. I see one. I would shoot but my pistol like. Oh my god you can become a spider.

434
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,040
Not in this version. Spank them. I wish I wish I wish you could kill them as a spider. Spank them John.

435
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:33,360
Why is that spider taking out? What is this? It's a pizza. What's a pizza? Oh they have little

436
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:39,840
jobs in the city. Yeah. We are just ruining their lives or monsters. That's okay. That's okay.

437
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:48,640
Journal. We got journal. We're going to hit them with journal. Oh. I need a parkour.

438
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:56,400
This gives you like news whenever you kill one I think. That actually just

439
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,880
reminded me. I remember one time I begged my dad to kill a spider because I was too scared of it.

440
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,480
I was like eight years old and he was too scared to do it as well and I was like oh thank you.

441
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:10,880
Really? Both of us were too scared and I was like okay. What am I supposed to do now?

442
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:15,440
Thanks father. Never asked again for help with this bitter.

443
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,800
I mean at least the spiders don't have to go to work first thing in the morning.

444
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:28,480
Like we're doing them a favour because it's not 9am yet so really they didn't have to do a shift

445
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:34,560
and then die. They like oh my god it's got baker's hat on it but oh I now feel a little bit bad.

446
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:39,920
Do they have to pay spider taxes and webs or something? Probably. They're like that loaf of bread

447
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:49,280
oh no sorry that one fly that was 50 webs sorry. I want to be right back hold on. Okay.

448
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:58,720
Did you guys get oh I finished the auto destruction. Beautiful. We've got to burn billboards too.

449
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:04,480
They're like coming out of the ice cream shop screaming. Ground spiders okay. Wait the spiders

450
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:10,720
underground are wearing little hats oh my god. Yeah they're like a bakery hat. A tank.

451
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:18,400
I'm a tank. Oh how did you do that? I don't know I just saw it on the ground. Oh wait oh you can go and

452
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:27,200
say the time. I love drowning. I'm a tank. The eel would say that. I love drowning little shits.

453
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:33,760
All right I'm gonna just put all the cars away I guess. A tank.

454
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:41,520
Tank tank tank tank tank. Let me see collect spiders hats and other accessories uh.

455
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:48,880
How do the spiders even drive a car? I don't know. Their legs can't even fit inside.

456
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,000
Joan is somebody doing this correctly?

457
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:01,600
Collect spider hats. Oh my god what if there are children in there? Sample finest. Spider children.

458
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:08,480
Spider children. Oh you can molotov. You got molotov? Hold on a minute let me get that on.

459
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:14,640
Where's that me? Why am I blue? Why am I blue? How did they have so many weapons as well?

460
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:20,000
You were rude the day. Wait why am I going backwards?

461
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:34,400
I figured it out. I figured it out. We'd be burning everything.

462
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,400
I don't know what the purple building is that's highlighted over here.

463
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,480
Juno. I am a tank and I'm coming.

464
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,080
It will survive one big giant eel or a wee tank.

465
01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:01,200
They work together. Defeat tanks. Oh my god we are the fancier girls now.

466
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:08,640
Hello. Hello. How'd I get on that again? Hold on. Get me in that tank that was fun.

467
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:15,440
Control. Oh. Is that a gay balloon? Oh it's a hot air balloon.

468
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:25,040
Let me put you out of your misery. It's screaming.

469
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:32,720
How do you get them to drown? I don't know. If they are on cars you can throw them to the water.

470
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,280
Oh okay I gotta burn this.

471
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:42,880
What? Is that a hank? Right hold on. There's a spider behind me.

472
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:49,760
I'm a tank. I'm a tank. Don't go right. I've definitely drowned one there.

473
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,960
Bro the creatures are so funny though. Oh you can't stand on them. Okay.

474
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,840
That'd be funny if you could just run over them.

475
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:07,440
Ha. They're very fast. They are. There's so many.

476
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:12,960
All right if there's like something on the side of a belly then just grab it.

477
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,760
You know what? Oh fuck I can't kill you with this. How many do we...

478
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,720
Defeat tanks. I've not even came across a tank yet. Out with the old.

479
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:31,520
Historic buildings. False advertising. Burn billboards.

480
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,240
Destroy spider tanks. Oh I see. All right I guess we become tanks then.

481
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,480
Oh my god they do spider tanks. Now they have tanks.

482
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,240
Now hold on a minute. They're so funny. We're like Avengers level threats.

483
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:57,040
Why do they have tanks? Are they hurting us? I don't know. I don't think so.

484
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:02,640
Yeah we have health now. There she is. All right hold on. Maybe we are the real

485
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:07,840
spiders all along. Oh Chinese can be a little tank. I'm a tank. I'm a fight back if they want

486
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:13,200
to fight with tanks I'm a tank. Wait did we do it? I'll show them a juggernaut. We can destroy the

487
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:22,400
buildings. Challenge complete. Oh wow that was easy. We did it. We're so good. Wait there's another

488
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:28,720
spider here. Oh my god do you see this like the spider statue of liberty? Oh destroy it. Destroy

489
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:36,400

490
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,960
I'm gonna I'm gonna be a little tank and then I'm gonna throw my bullets at it. Yeah throw it.

491
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:47,920
Shooting it doesn't do anything too. Yeah it's not really working. Allow me. I might be small but

492
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:53,440
my oh no my tank is far too short. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. I'm gonna see if I can get to

493
01:04:53,440 --> 01:05:02,640
the edge. Come on. Come on. Oh no that's so tiny. That's so tiny. Nice. Is it gonna hit? Aim higher.

494
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:08,400
Uh I don't I can't see anything from up here babe. Is it working? Uh aim straight up.

495
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:15,920
That's like as high as I can go. Oh shit. I literally cannot see anything. Did we get an RPG?

496
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:23,280
We must get an RPG this map. Come on. Get me an RPG right now. I'm off. Wait we have to collect

497
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:32,160
30 spider hats and accessories. I don't know how to. When you kill them if you look at the floor

498
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:40,480
there's so many like little hats. Oh and we can just take them? Yeah I can. Oh I love robbing them.

499
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:51,200
I love robbing their dead body. We're pillaging. Oh I see that's how you get the hats. Oh yeah.

500
01:05:52,560 --> 01:06:01,200
Oh my god I love stealing from spiders. Oh did we already go on this side? No we must

501
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:05,360
though because there's destroyed buildings over here. Oh my god. Okay there's like two main islands.

502
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:12,880
All right I'm gonna look for hats though. Their screams are so sad. It's okay.

503
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:20,000
Remember what they did to us long ago. Exactly. What did they do actually? Yeah what did they do?

504
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:28,800
Oh okay. I'm not gonna accidentally go through that. Does anyone have any later fluid? I can tell

505
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:41,600
that we are doing monsters. No. Why do you say that? I don't know. I don't know. This is a hunch?

506
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:52,480
Maybe I'm just being self-conscious. It's okay. You're not doing anything wrong. Yeah you're right.

507
01:06:53,120 --> 01:07:00,320
Yo dem steal their hats. Ah big spider. Story balloons and boats. Don't mind if I do. Oh my god.

508
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:06,960
My aim is so short. What's with the balloons? Oh wait you can actually shoot the balloons? Yeah

509
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:14,720
yeah if you shoot the balloons it's a part of one of the milestones. We need like four more balloons.

510
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:22,800
I shot two. I can't. A boat is as well if you see a boat in the water shoot a boat.

511
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:35,280
Okay. Finest cuisines. I can see one boat. Okay I know what the historic buildings are.

512
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:46,800
Oh the billboard. What a pathetic little ship there. Oh no for your sadisticness is coming out.

513
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:53,840
Wait what is this? I got a burrito. Oh yeah yeah yeah like we have to destroy all the

01:07:54,560 --> 01:08:00,640
we have to get the foods too. The cuisine. Oh for the billboard? Yeah you have to on the buildings.

515
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:08,560
Yeah they have to be on their buildings. This game is like way bigger than I would ever have

516
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:18,400
expected. Like way bigger. It's really big. It's very silly. It's a nice thing to do though. Although

517
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,280
I'm starting to feel a little bit bad but like hearing them scream and run away I'm like oh

518
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:29,920
I'm like you're starting to kill a needle of heart strings. Too real. Too real stuff. Yeah I'm

519
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:38,160
like I don't want to like start wildly attacked though. Okay there's a bunch over here. Oh there's

520
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:44,480
like challenges on the antenna. Oh in order to say oh my god that's so cool. Some of the

521
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:51,520
companions collect spider heads one more. Oh kill we have to kill one more spider.

522
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:58,560
I got it. There we go. There we go. It's so like when you destroy these buildings inside there's

523
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:05,120

to open them. Oh yeah. Okay I see. Purple building. Purple building. Okay I see.

It may. Oh there's a purple one. Okay one more historical building. The historical building's

533
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:16,880
just like older than the other buildings if that helps. Oh there's one over here. They got that

534
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:26,560
detail too. Oh yeah yeah kill it. I'm killing it. I'm killing it. I think that's it right.

535
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:36,320
Still cannot destroy it. I think oh I guess not. I don't have any more ammo.

536
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:43,840
I don't even know how you supposed to push them. What building is it? But it looks destroyed.

537
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:45,280
Huh.

538
01:10:49,200 --> 01:11:03,200
Do you know how to destroy a sister? Yeah. Yeah I do. Thank you. Destroy everything.

539
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:09,200
Wait you have to defeat tanks in the RC tank. Is it tank tank? Wait would it be faster to

540
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:16,240
blow up the tank? Yeah probably that's what they're for. But how do we see the other tanks?

541
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:23,360
Yeah that's the way faster. Oh really? Wait how do you become a tank? I'm gonna destroy everything.

542
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:33,040
You have to find the in the queue if you press Q. You can find the tank control. It's like a

543
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:45,520
little cart. Do you control? Oh look it's another recipe. For the witch thing? Yeah look. Oh my god

544
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:53,840
it all connects together. Oh so you have to like keep going back and forth? I mean the adorable orange tank.

545
01:11:54,240 --> 01:12:06,320
Did I just see? Oh this. Rad cola. Keep smelling a screenshot. Rad cola. Okay. Do we have to

546
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:12,080
write that down? Do we have to write the recipe now? We have three more spiders to drone. Maybe we

547
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:20,160
should screenshot it. I screenshotted it. Okay nice. Okay. What other objectives do you have to

548
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:29,040
defeat? We still need to drone them. They are not making this easy. I need another. I need to get

549
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:35,920
a drone to another one. How do you drown them? Throw the cars. They'll be attached to an item

550
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:44,400
if you use the wee scanner and then yeet into the water. That's messed up. Okay. Okay we need to

551
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:56,560
also burn two more billboards. Why'd they make this so like I don't know controversial but this

552
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:03,120
seems difficult. Like there's so many layers to. You have to watch yourself slowly become the villain.

553
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:10,320
Yeah you live long enough to become the villain. Yes. There's a billboard. Oh wait no I think it's

554
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:17,040
already destroyed. Already burned. Okay okay okay. I need we need to drown one more bitch.

555
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:25,520
Throw their cars into the ocean garden. I think that bridge that we can't get past this one that

556
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:30,800
needs 20 freaking rocks is where everything else is so I don't know if we need to go back to like

557
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:38,240
another teleport basically. I see. That would be my guess right now because I don't have one more

558
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:49,040
scooter. Oh my gosh. There's billboards over there. Oh I found one more billboard. Oh you did? Yeah.

559
01:13:52,400 --> 01:14:00,080
I sort of break everything. A historic building. A historic building. I can't see.

560
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:07,920
There's any other cars here so I can drown one. One more billboard and we unlock another

561
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:17,520
like purple. Oh I drowned one. Yes sir. What did you unlock? Okay I opened this one. Oh nice nice nice.

562
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:24,800
Beat it up. Destroy it. Show us his balls. Show us his balls. You're stuck.

563
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:37,280
So that's their team. So we can go back to that haunted mansion and do the bottom door on the

564
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:43,680
floor. Oh I found another billboard. Wait. Oh you got it. That's the last one. You did it. You did it.

565
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:48,240
You did it. We got another one. Oh my god it's all coming together. It's all coming together now.

566
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:53,440
Hold on. Oh my god. We just didn't drown one more little bitch. No no. Fuyu did it. She did it.

567
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:59,600
She drowned it. She drowned it and we got it. Oh yeah. Oh we didn't destroy another like balloon

568
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:07,120
thing then. Okay. Is this a historical building? I think it is. Yeah. I just see you guys.

569
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:18,160
Did we destroy a historical building? There we go. There we go. Okay. Okay. I see I see.

570
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:25,600
Okay that's 15. How much is the bridge? 20 or something? 20. Oh that's rough. I think we

571
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:32,480
might have to go back to the witch's culture. I want to go back. Also your your body friggin.

572
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,160
When you're hitting things with the newspaper your body just contorts.

573
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:47,280
Dude there's no weapons. There's no more air balloons. I think it must be visible behind those

574
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:53,680
buildings from back there. Yeah. Maybe. Also we missed the chance to defeat tanks with the tank.

575
01:15:55,040 --> 01:16:00,640
Oh it became like 5. I think we maybe need to restart it. If Emmy goes to one of the

576
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:06,000
antennas to restart the mission. Yeah. There might be more tanks in the next town over there.

577
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:14,080
Then tennis is over here. There's one over here. Oh yeah. It like starts a mini game. Yeah.

578
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:19,520
And we can redo it. Destroy spider tanks. Okay this is the one. This is the one. We're strong. Yeah we

579
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:26,160
can redo it. Oh that one? Yeah. Right. I'm going to turn into a tank and then we should get to tanks

580
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:33,680
everybody. Okay. I'm ready. Wait hold on. I spawned me all the way over here. Are they serious?

581
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:40,240
Should I let you left it? Oh it gets left on the right. I'm very slowly coming over.

582
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:49,280
Oh you can recall it. We're coming in. We're coming in rolling. They see us rolling.

583
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:59,920
Oh look at that. Okay that makes sense. Catch me riding dirty. Oh wait there's a recipe in there.

584
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:07,600
Okay okay. Okay four years ahead. We're coming and do that right okay. So now once Emmy activates

585
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:14,640
the mission we'll all jump in tanks and go mental. Yay. Yes it's time to explode.

586
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:22,800
I'm very slowly coming. Oh I mean. I'm actually riding dirty.

587
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:31,520
I'm not seeing it. I'm not seeing it. Okay ready? Ready. Yeah I did it. Oh it took me out.

588
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,880
Where are they? Are you jogging me? I took me out of the tank only to. Oh there see I'm going to see

589
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:40,560
them. Oh why am I in the. I see them. I see them green. Should the green. Should the green. Green bad.

590
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:48,800
Green bad. Green bad. Wait it's not even hitting. Is it registering? Is it working for you guys?

591
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:54,000
Yes but it's not a single kill. Very badly. One kill hit. You have to hit them multiple times.

592
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:00,320
I'm spraying and preying. Okay. Okay that's three. That's three. That's three. Two more. Two more.

593
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:10,080
Two more. Two more ladies. Okay. My tank exploded. It's okay. Oh my tank's gonna die too. Where are

594
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:18,960
they? They're in the center. Oh. Yes. Let's go. Oh my god it's clicking. I think it's clicking.

595
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:26,880
Oh my god. Right now we can go be up a building. Whatever one it may be. This one. Oh that pink one.

596
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:31,600
The pink highlight. Yeah it's like a green question mark on the map. Oh I see it. I see it.

597
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:44,320
Oh my god. We did it. I'm balling. So that's it. We're playing worlds of tank there.

598
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:54,560
Nice. For an early access game this is massive. This is early access? Yeah this isn't even the

599
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:59,280
full release. This is like 0.6. They're not even close to implementing all the stuff they want to do.

600
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:09,760
Oh money. I just stole money from a spider. Oh my god. Wait no it was Emma. Oh.

601
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:16,720
How is there not one boat that we can shoot? I don't get it. That's what I'm saying.

602
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:24,160
Maybe there's another objective or there's another mini game too. That's just like kill

603
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:31,200
spiders. Maybe some hot air balloon ones will appear. Right? It's over here. I think they're shooting

604
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:38,880
things at us. What? There must be soldiers. Soldier ants. Go away. No ants. Okay. No scooters.

605
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:46,240
Same thing. Yeah this one's just for the soldier ones. Should I activate it?

606
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:53,120
Yeah. Just to see what'll happen. Kill soldier spiders before the tamer expires. Oh this is

607
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:57,280
another one. Run! Run! Get them. Get them. Get them. Get them. Get them. Hunt them down. Hunt them down.

608
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:03,120
Make them regret being born. Make them regret being born. Oh my god. They're in tanks. They're

609
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:12,000
in tanks. Oh my god. Everyone's getting burnt alive. I have terrible aim. It's over. Geneva

610
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:18,240
convention's out the window. I'm on a rampage. All right. Okay. We've got seven. We've got seven.

611
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:26,240
We're doing it. We're doing it. We're doing it. Come on. Keep going. Oh fuck. Okay 15. That's 15.

612
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:33,760
Satisfying. I feel like this is wrong. They're trying to run away. It's a great way to release

613
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:39,120
stress. Challenge complete. Right. That's another one. Let's freaking go. We're doing it. We're doing

614
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:44,480
it. We're doing it. Yeah. Right. I guess what did we do that for? Nothing we can do. That didn't

615
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:51,680
unlock anything? Yeah. Unlock. Right. My controversial take is we need to go back to the

616
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:57,920
witch's place now to unlock more. I know. It was controversial. I'm sorry if we get cancelled

617
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:07,440
over that statement. It is what it is. We're going. We've got to go. We're ready. Okay. Enter

618
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:16,880
port. Ready. Only the host. Oh right. Okay. Immerse tank. Going. Right. Hydration check. Hydration

619
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:23,040
check. Oh water. Drink your water. I don't have water. But I have a droplet device. Cheers.

620
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:28,880
What? Cheers. Cheers. Come fast. Oh look at all the stuff that we can go to though. Like before

621
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:34,160
we see that. Oh my god. Let's explore. Yeah. Yeah. Explore the ship. That's so much. Okay. It's

622
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:39,600
finally clicking in my head how this game mechanic worked. I'm so sorry. It took me an hour and a

623
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:47,360
half. This is literally a Metroidvania game. Oh what? You still work bench and

624

Actually if you're an eel can you? No. Huh? What? Can you slime if you're an eel?

655
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:09,520
No. That's not what eels do. I think those are a little slimy. I don't think people know a lot about

656
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:17,680
how eel slime. Oh wait we can open this. Wait come here. But you know you see the 20? Yeah.

658
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:31,040
Metroidvania. The command wing. I think we can take this. Oh wait. Let's open this. There's already

659
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:38,160
dead spiders in this area. I don't trust it. Kill zombie spiders. They're not dead. They're not dead.

660
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:46,000
I'm dead. Spawn Kimms. Spawn Kimms. Welcome to the command wing. There's three. There's

661
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:53,280
three zombie spiders we need to perish. Or nor. Or nor. Right here. We're going to show you numbers

662
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:58,480
in chat right now. Wait what? Oh they're dying near each other. They've come back to life. Wait they

663
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:07,840
just keep coming over and over. Oh sorry. They're dying near each other. I think we take this to the

664
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:17,120

669
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:48,720
I mean I'm hearing them getting burned. That's why I use the flamethrower a lot because

670
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:52,640
it just burns them. Wait why is that? Oh there's one.

671

Chest one more compound X my yes, what chest?

683
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:54,680
Yeah, this chest had a oh, did we kill a zombie? I think so

684
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,640
We're any two compound now, so

685
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,520
Oh, we do with the compound

686
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:04,240
What?

687
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:06,240
No, I got a compound or zombies

688
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,240
I

689
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,520
Think real

690
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:20,240
Well, we go back to the teleporter again to the new areas because we've unlocked so many new things like in the other area

691
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:24,960
Okay, okay, okay. Where's the top serotonin on my brain from unlocking things?

692
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:30,760
Yeah, I don't think there's anything else we can do here. Did we ever find all of the dumbbells?

693
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:33,280
Yes, we did

694
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:39,280
Oh, so I unlocked something so now we can shoot with this, but I don't understand it

695
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,280
I don't know where we're supposed to shoot with this

696
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:47,200
Can we shoot the whole spider planet down? No, wait

697
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:50,560
Mass extinction event

698
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:55,880
That looks I saw I I don't know how to get I opened up a teleporter over here

699
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:58,120
So like you can control it from above

700
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:02,680
Whoa, look up bird's-eye view. Oh, no

701
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:04,920
You just get it from the screen. Yeah

702
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:11,480
Find a way through the reactor blast. Oh the reactor blast or where's the reactor blast door?

703
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:17,960
It's probably this whole thing the red stuff these red things right here. Oh

704
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:23,800
Oh, I know the reactor doors to the right there at three o'clock. Oh, maybe oh

705
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:25,920
Can you and destroy that?

706
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:32,000
Can you aim? Oh, I can see the the thing turning around very slowly. Yeah, okay

707
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,800
I'm aiming. I'm shooting

708
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:44,320
They really couldn't have made that any slower could they hmm. No, it's very slow. It's okay patience. I feel myself aging

709
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,800
I'm getting

710
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:55,040
Slowly, but surely are we supposed to break the window?

711
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:00,360
Don't

712
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:08,400
What if he's well, I may actually kill some spiders in the room at random. So that night. Yeah

713
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:16,360
Okay, okay, just a little bit more a little up a little up. I think that's good. That's enough. Just go a little up

714
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,560
Excuse me with the cold spider behind us

715
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:28,160
Is it working I don't know what we're supposed to do

716
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:31,680
Was there an instruction?

717
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:38,360
Yeah, you can talk to Darwin you can talk to Darwin the way through the reactor blast door

718
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:46,240
Some disassembly required. I just there's no way that's supposed to be able to aim all the way over, right? Unless it's

719
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:51,440
I'm no convinced I'm no

720
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:53,440
curious

721
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,640
Reactor blast control emergency action

722
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:04,920
It's great

723
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,200
You need to I don't understand

724
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:16,040
Says reactor so maybe we shoot this yeah, the door. Yeah, that's what I was thinking, but I don't know how to aim it

725
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,320
Hold on

726
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:24,560
it told us

727
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:29,560
It told us to that a Darwin said for this door imagine little

728
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:36,080
Ants a little spiders and tanks, so I think we have to go back to the giant test world and destroy it I

729
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:41,920
Don't know Darwin randomly just made a reference to the we answered tank

730
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:48,240
That was my one and only attempt at small talk, and then that's it. He doesn't say anything now. Oh, oh

731
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,840
Yeah, can we tell?

732
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:54,840
No

733
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,200
Destination control air

734
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,840
Wait, no way that worked

735
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,560
100 I

736
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,600
Yeah

737
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:14,720
Burning them in case there's a spitter in them. Oh, and there is

738
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:22,000
Here we reactivate the teleport control room

739
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:24,920
Long way around

740
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,360
This room will be

741
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:31,720
You sell and sir. Oh, there's a spider here. You'll be spider thing

742
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,440
That's good. Nope

743
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:41,640
You'll need to locate three out the six. Oh fuel cells and calibrate the gate

744
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:47,840
Okay, I found one I found one. Oh

745
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:53,320
Here's in the oh, I lied so one of the fuel cells is in the

746
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:58,040
Ventilator system that connects to the reactor

747
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:02,200
Yes, wait that connects the reactor to the control room

748
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:11,520
I'm really bad at your actions the reactor core. I'm going to lock her. Oh, I just have come

749
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,760
Ventilator system, what about the others?

750
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:20,880
There is also a very large life form in that in that section

751
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:30,760
Yo, oh wait we can become a wee spider can't we maybe I think we can

752
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:36,200
Also, we need to put something in the reactor and I don't understand what is it. Oh, they're

753
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:41,480
Yes, I don't know where to get them though. Wait, how are you coming?

754
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:45,760
Only the host may perform this action begin challenge sneak through. Oh

755
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:49,760
Did you try this at me or not yet? Oh

756
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:55,040
Right sneak through

757
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:01,440
Everyone's right. I don't know. I'm just gonna cry. I hope not. Oh

758
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:10,800
Get ready to get attacked use the tracker to detect nearby spiders

759
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,520
There's nothing here for now

760
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:23,440
Wait, what? Oh wait, we're not to attack them. I guess not let them pass. I guess we're just trying to sneak through. Yeah

761
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:29,160
Oh

762
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:36,640
I don't think we can kill it. Oh

01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:49,360
Epilepsy simulator

766
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:52,360
Why are we hitting it slow motion?

767
01:35:52,360 --> 01:36:01,360
I don't know. I think we're crouching. I think we're crouching. I think you're faster when you're crouching. I found it. I found it. I found a fuel cell.

768
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:03,360

771
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:16,200
I like to be I wanted to kill it though. We have a teleport now. Oh

772
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:24,360
Spiders are not as cunning as they think scants are just many of the vindicators have stolen. Okay. We need one more

773
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:27,240
One more what?

774
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,360

01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,880
I thought those were key codes, but they weren't last time. I think it's just

783
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:13,440
Okay

784
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:19,280
Let me double check the other one. Maybe we should put them in the same place so we don't lose it. Okay

785
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:25,120
Complete vent challenges through the vindicate wait, there's more vent challenges like that

786
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:30,200
I'm just one of them

787
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:36,160

01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:27,480
Just going for it. I think our best approach is just going for it

797
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:31,480
Right, I don't know if it's gonna like

798
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:34,200

01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:37,480
Challenge, okay. Oh, I got 25. We did it. We've got 25 compound. I don't know what that means

812
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
That we can do but I'll take it

813
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:43,540
This is the wrong teleport. I didn't mean that one. Hold on

814
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:46,360
This

815
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:48,360
How do we get inside here? Oh

01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:50,520
And I'm back

817
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:57,560
Compound X across across all dimensions. We need 35. Oh, how do I get upstairs? There's something up there, huh?

818
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:03,120
There's a question mark. Oh, like I'll do it up there. Oh, oh, oh, oh, it's one over here. Yeah. Oh

01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:17,320
cheeky knit week but we don't even know what the access to kitchen in the

1023
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:29,560
who's access the kitchen where's the I'm assuming the kitchen is this where it's

1024
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:40,640
right here yeah it's a twist I'll go make another potion and see if it counts

1025
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:50,000
towards the oh yeah yeah let me see let me pull up my screenshot okay we did

1026
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:57,600
not just didn't tell for and I don't I don't think so why would they not leave

1027
01:56:57,600 --> 01:57:05,800
that oh no so bring it to a simmer okay wait you have the recipe right yes add

1028
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:17,520
one femur okay what that wasn't me I'm spinning a fever a femur a leg bone yeah

1029
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:24,240
is there yeah this one the big the femur is the biggest bone yeah I put it in

1030
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:29,520
and exploded I didn't like it well then try it again maybe it was something to do

1031
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:45,040
with the fire and first all the bikes back to hon and us what happens when I

1032
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:48,080
finish the femurs because we only have one more few oh no there's another one

1033
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:52,720
here it should be good leave us alone tricycle we're trying to make potions in

1034
01:57:52,720 --> 01:58:00,480
here put it in oh yeah I don't know the fire do you have to put the potion here

1035
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:08,840
like yeah use it on a fire you did you do two fires oh maybe maybe I had to

1036
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:15,920
like break open the building more what do you mean break the building more is

1037
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:21,920
it like incomplete no like maybe maybe I don't know how to explain it maybe I had

1038
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:27,520
to like completely destroy the building so that it came out or something like the

1039
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:37,120
fire did you do the two try to guess fire right the two fires yeah oh I guess

1040
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:43,280
maybe that try I'm not on the trace I'm one with the tricycle there's four fires

1041
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:48,960
that's all should you like them all no no no no first simmer it's just two but

1042
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:54,720
yeah if I put it in explodes and do we have to do simmer do we have to do

1043
01:58:54,720 --> 01:59:00,400
something else that is a femur a femur is a boon yeah it's a dream

1044
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:05,680
matching to a simmer add one femur stir until potion takes a rosy hue add one

1045
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:12,560
to be a femur this is a femur where's the tibia maybe this is the tibia the

1046
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:17,280
femur is the largest bone in the human body so everyone looks the biggest is

1047
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:24,080
the femur oh yeah and it should have a femur no they're not the same look at them this is a

1048
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:31,520
oh okay the weird one will be the tibia wait which one is the tibia where's the tibia

1049
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:37,440
okay I don't know I'm gonna do a few few cheeky spins Denny you buddy I'll keep

1050
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:45,280
you straight when it comes to biology okay okay I'm ready but they look the same no

1051
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:50,800
no they don't look at the femur yeah that one the one that Fuyu is holding look at the hip

1052
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:56,400
that's the hip bone that goes into it on the top of the femur so yeah right two fires in the simmer

1053
01:59:56,400 --> 02:00:06,400
before you put it in okay femur what the fuck I don't I'm why would it not register that I don't

1054
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:12,320
understand I don't know simmer simmer fires is there any fire mentioned on your screenshot

1055
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:15,920
or is it literally like yeah yeah yeah no it's just bring cauldron to a simmer it's too

1056
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:20,160
yeah I think I had a break open the building completely

1057
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:29,920
oh that's annoying yeah yeah two fires is the simmer then do we have to leave the two fires for

1058
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:37,440
a little bit I don't think so I think the game's being annoying hold on and we never came out into

1059
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:46,720
the circle oh how do we open the oh sorry I didn't call it wise I didn't call it wise

1060
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:52,720
it's okay I guess I I think I did have to like break open the building more

1061
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:58,240
do you want to go back or will we wrap it up I was gonna say are we wrapping it up

1062
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:05,920
we're wrapping it up we're wrapping it up okay I mean I'm pretty satisfied with how much

1063
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:11,760
progress we made because I was praying for having like seen that game go like it's just like

1064
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:17,040
no way it works this time is it because foo use insane

1065
02:01:18,160 --> 02:01:28,960
food you are amazing you're you're it'll be the luck of yours making it work you have a spider on

1066
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:35,200
your face it's okay I would whack if I don't want to break the cauldron I'm just gonna well there you go

1067
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:40,800
hold on hold on it's still there I don't know I killed it mix in a magic potion

1068
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:49,840
dude mix in a magic oh I have no idea where that's not working I think it might have worked

1069
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:55,600
because you let it simmer for a little bit well you should have thought about that before having

1070
02:01:55,600 --> 02:02:02,320
impatient players I can't believe that it doesn't instantly work right away after we follow the

1075
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:36,800
would have dragged a wee bit less but I think now that we understand the core element yeah or I

1093
02:04:48,640 --> 02:04:55,040
and some beach of her collab secrets you actually join in a voice call like one hour

1094
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:59,520
before the collab so you end up like chatting away for like an hour just doing your thing

1095
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:08,400
memin about and that that game wasn't terrible that game wasn't terrible I think it just wasn't

1096
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:14,000
obvious unless I'm just too low IQ to comprehend everything we were supposed to do

1097
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:22,720
it wasn't terrible but I have to admit when the progress was slow and it was like bro what are

1098
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:28,960
we supposed to do it was like it was like legal replay unlock vibes I think it's not

1099
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:34,320
now I don't have to say disclaimer disclaimer disclaimer hardly even nor

1100
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:45,360
it is an early access game and actually the vealer girl's really lucky we actually got the

1101
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:49,760
code for free we didn't have to pay for it feels good man well they don't stop coming and they

1102
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:56,160

1108
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:26,240

1109
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:33,520
and I'm just I'm ready pretty good obviously it needs a little bit of cheeky polishing okay

1117
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:32,880
game I just wish it was a bit more obvious but that may not make just me uh my fellow Americans

1118
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:39,280
I might just be brain dead that's all that's my only that's my only comment okay um I would say

1119
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:46,800
that game though was pretty decent for a collaboration game it's really hard in my humble opinion

1120
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:55,760
okay in my humble opinion it's rather hard to find games that are decent for collaborations

1121
02:07:55,760 --> 02:08:02,480
because they always seem to oh is she being all coming online today no she is because she's playing

collab is around the corner Yumi recorded her line so that's around the corner um and I don't know

1132
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:17,120
if I'm allowed to cheekily say this uh but Juno and Shuyu said they wouldn't be adverse to doing

1133
02:09:17,120 --> 02:09:24,640
a one-on-one ASMR collab with me so I may also get to do a collab with them and I may say it for

1134
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:33,680
that key um because it will be really cute um so I might be able to do that soon it's not going to

1135
02:09:33,680 --> 02:09:37,440
come out anytime soon because obviously it takes time to kick these things okay think think of that

1136
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:43,200
cauldron okay think of that cauldron I was spinning that shit but they were like they were like oh my

1137
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:48,000
god yeah we're totally done for that because they have three deals and I was like if you ever have

1138
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:56,160
the time to do this I'll be killed because um I went with Juno was a did actually like I greeted

1139
02:09:56,160 --> 02:10:01,280
an ASMR collab with me she was like I remembered you still want to do it and I'm like yes please

1140
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:09,680
that would be really nice um so don't break it I know don't break it good job that's supposed

1141
02:10:09,680 --> 02:10:16,640
to count for your hundred ASMRs left yeah it's um we're actually getting there uh I'm not kidding

1142
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:23,040
I know the the audios haven't made it to light on YouTube yet it's because um obviously it takes

1143
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:27,840
time and I have to wait on the collab partner's lines or after record new sound effects type thing

1144
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:32,400
like I've been waiting to record new sound effects but it's been a freaking freaking storm

1293
02:28:34,080 --> 02:28:41,760
my cheek because I get closer oh no she's grapefruit and that's such a good little terminology

1294
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:49,840
for it you find her and she's just eating dinner and gulping soda the clap is alerting the players

1295
02:28:49,840 --> 02:29:00,240
they're winning instead of you died you could try again oh it should be an nnn game and then your

1296
02:29:00,240 --> 02:29:08,080
the objective is not to get them because once I find you it's over you're not like we are not

1297
02:29:08,080 --> 02:29:16,560
departing until your ink sack is empty thank you you need to make that your next game real

1298
02:29:16,560 --> 02:29:22,960
yeah the game's fully uh about to be wrapped up in a bowl and I'm really mad at myself about it but

1299
02:29:22,960 --> 02:29:27,360
it's the best I can do because it was the first time I've ever took on a project size I will talk

1300
02:29:27,360 --> 02:29:32,000
about it at a later date while it went horrifically wrong long so short it was all my fault because

1301
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:37,520
I've never taken on a project that size and hopefully the gameplay resonates out a little

1302
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:44,000
bit you've infected my mind I can't stop thinking about being put under I think my next hypno stream

1303
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:49,520
is like two weeks away um I'm gonna try it with the smb and I'm just gonna have the

1304
02:29:50,240 --> 02:29:55,280
in the background when I start off I'm not gonna do an echo or if I do it might be like the world's

1305
02:29:55,280 --> 02:30:06,320
slightest echo because it was a too strong last thing I'm sure it's gonna be like that one vampire

1306
02:30:06,320 --> 02:30:13,040
game I do oh the microwave that you call the microwave sound as if I like freaking got that

1307
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:19,200
produced in the corner should I get found on purpose or should I try to prolong the inevitable

1308
02:30:20,480 --> 02:30:24,160
I don't know what would be the reward at the end of the game for not getting done so

1309
02:30:25,360 --> 02:30:32,080
refling you twerp a late echo might be good as long as we're drained by the end of playing

1310
02:30:32,080 --> 02:30:45,920
off we have yeah wait are all reeflings male pretty much uh I make content that's like for for

1311
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:52,880
guys and I've always kind of like done it that way hopefully it doesn't make you feel put out but

1312
02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:58,960
there are like a few female reeflings but they just ignore when I say male or like he him type stuff

1313
02:30:58,960 --> 02:31:06,240
which is like I mean I don't know I think that's pretty cool there's also pretty sure we are no I

1314
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:16,160
meant sm what does that mean I'm so sorry you make content for male attention real I only play video

1317
02:31:35,440 --> 02:31:39,520
where are you gonna make content for the other gender it's a shame I do sometimes get comments

1318
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:44,480
like that and I want to like reply to them and just be like I'm sorry and here's the explanation why

1319
02:31:45,440 --> 02:31:51,440
