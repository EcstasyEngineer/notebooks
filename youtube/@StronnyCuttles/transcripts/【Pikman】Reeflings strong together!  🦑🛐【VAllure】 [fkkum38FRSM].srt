28
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:43,200

29
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,640
firmly this is so cute I'll leave a little blue heart

30
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,200
she's a blue I buddy I would have had past you gently but for me

31
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,800
right there we go I've never applied to all my gen mates no one can say that I'm

32
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,040
on social publicly because obviously we talk behind the scenes but no one can

33
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:10,600
say we're not thinking okay right we are playing a little game called Pikmin

34
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:21,000
no this is the gospel I have played this game once in my life in the hospital

35
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,320
when they thought I had appendicitis but it was actually my first anxiety

36
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:33,720
she's starting a gastro distress okay so my perception of this game is

37
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,440
absolutely agony going on in my abdomen but I still played it anyway and the

38
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,880
fucking nurses are cheeky weebams so there is fuck all to do in the hospital

39
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,440
and obviously I open up the cabinet like there was kids gaming on it and I sat

40
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,200
in game I took all the kids off it so I could play the one level and Pikmin

41
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,960
that I could complete over and over again because I got stuck because I was a

42
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,800
child okay but like this is when like the Nintendo DS was out the Xbox was out

43
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,720
the PlayStation was out and obviously technology takes a while to catch up in

44
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,160
a fucking child's hospital and I was like what ancient technology is this and

45
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,240
I'm like pretty sure it was like a Nintendo 64 or something I had never

46
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,080
like the the system thing I've never seen it in my life so I was like what is

47
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,600
this and I was like watching the other kids play it and then once they went away

48
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:32,960
I sat on that thing the entire fucking day so that's all no no I turned up for

49
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,240
you I didn't have appendicitis they made me like piss into a thing and it went

50
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,120
everywhere and I just remember it going everywhere on the floor and I had to

51
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,720
like clean up that for myself a game cube yeah I was like what is this this

52
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:54,600
doesn't look like an Xbox and the nurse was a cheeky wee sneaky so it was the

53
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,200
end of the night where she's like to close up the game like they have to close

54
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,720
up the cabinets in the hospital you've ever been in a once I only stayed two

55
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,440
nights or something and they were like now you're not your appendicitis and

56
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,880
burst and we don't know what's wrong when you go home and obviously looking back

57
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,160
I know it's exciting now but and before it was enough to put you in the hospital

58
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,040
yes I was an absolute agony my guts are twist my I'm the type where my guts twist

59
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,120
that's why I've got a lot of anxiety about taking a big fat massive dump okay

60
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,040
I don't care I'll say it how it is that's where my abomb manifests I don't

61
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,400
know how your abomb manifests that's how mine manifests okay it's around taking

62
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,240
the toilet and so she was like okay they're giving medicine so you need to go

63
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,840
back to your bed so went back to my bed took my medicine she feel a little

64
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,120
nurse she locked the cabinet so I couldn't keep playing Pikmin UV BAM but

65
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,480
it's probably good for me go to sleep at regular time but you know so this is

66
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,360
pick man I'm gonna make sure my controllers work in and praying it

67
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,560
doesn't crash because I'm using a real game cube right now so I'm gonna

68
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,840
verbalize as my pain bro it's all around the toilet for me actual shotgun

69
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,880
spray no it wasn't the game tube contemporary but I just never seen a

70
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,920
game cube before so when I saw it I was like what is that I still an expert

71
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:16,360
mind you I'm like a tiny wee wane I can hardly formulate sentences and I'm like

72
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,880
hmm something's not right here my gamer instincts are going off this isn't

73
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:28,320
correct this is the wrong technology and tricky nurse chicks yes the nurses

74
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,400
my low IQ child mind could not comprehend that she wanted to lock the

75
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:41,640
cabinet and do you want us to take her out no no not at all and where's violent

76
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,040
what ancient wizardry I was like I've ever seen such scriptures before and I

77
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,360
was like damn I can see every pixel on the screen what's literally what is this

78
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,040
purple square box what does it do right lemme hydrate I got my cup of tea

79
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,480
obviously believe it or not sleeping for 11 hours you get rather dehydrated

80
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,840
and that's I went for a pee and it was like the world's tiniest amount of pee

81
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:13,960
give me okay that's easy I might be lucky every time I spent the night in a

82
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:20,480
hospital I was for someone else I had that with my family I've never had to

83
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,320
spend the night though because I was very young when they became ill I had

84
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,800
sleepovers with my gran when she was sick but obviously I don't know if you

85
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,640
heard about the news and the old NHS they're siphoning the old money out of

86
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:42,160
it so it's hardly functioning hospitals are a unique area but I know a lot of

87
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,080
it's actually secretly reported that a lot of guys have a fear of the hospital

88
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,320
and but I don't know whether that's because a relative you saw someone or

89
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,240
your concept of the hospital isn't to get better it's where you go when you're

90
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,760
sick and you don't want to be sick and it's rather interesting why the fuck is

91
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:08,720
my game point oh no is it broken I can't even oh I mean I mean my my game cube

92
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:19,240
woke up yes oh my god what's up music oh oh hit him with it oh my god what is

108
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,760
name is captain olimar while traveling through space my ship was struck by me

109
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,760
I must have blacked out and I woke on the surface of this weird planet so with

110
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,040
so many parts lost the skeletal hull of my beloved dolphin is a painful sight

111
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,880
the engine is gone and I'm stranded to make matters worse my atmospheric

112
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,960
sensors indicate this planet's environment contains high levels of

113
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:54,680
poisonous oxygen my life support system can't wait I can die my life support

114
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,560
system can't function for only 30 days if I can't repair the dolphin by then no

115
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,400
I better not think about it I must find the missing ship but can you die in this

116
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:14,000
game oh yeah over just means is it too loud or you dying 30 days no joke bro

117
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,600
can we zoom out a bit no this is very old technology I'm afraid right let's

118
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:27,320
investigate are you oh we found something

119
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,040
have you chosen what gen 2 is going to be called instead of gen 1 called and

120
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,560
does all the gents have been named already she knows what they are lol I

121
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,760
sure you think has appeared before me I had barely begun my search when it reared

122
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:53,560
up as if it were waiting for me it then dropped a single seed what is this it is

123
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:59,040
alive it is a machine it resembles a vegetable in my home planet that we call

124
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,480
an onion I shall call them an onion too

125
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,480
an onion

126
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:20,080
oh first little pickling oh my god I'm gonna pull on your stem I'm gonna pull

127
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,320
so hard and I'm gonna yank on your stem the seed that the onion dropped took

128
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,480
root in the soil and has now produced an adorable little sprout this sprout

129
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,040
emits a strange light as it sways back and forth without benefits of wind I

130
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,320
cannot help but think it is calling to me I am compelled I must approach it and

131
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,120
press alpha are you ready I'm gonna I'm gonna touch your stem

132
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:50,760
oh hi oh my god you're actually kind of cute though

133
00:13:53,560 --> 00:14:00,520
extraordinary when I plucked the sprout it turned out to be a living creature not a

134
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,720
plant picking it has done no visible damage it just stands there staring at

135
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:13,000
me its shape is similar to the pick pick brand carrot I love so much I believe I

136
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,000
shall call it pickling here I am stranded on a toxic planet fighting to

137
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,160
survive and yet I'm intrigued I must research this fascinating creature I

138
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,600
shall try to grab it and throw it with an a and then I will call it to my side

139
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:36,800
with B hmm perhaps it will also react to analog stick in X as well fuck there is

140
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,840
no X I wanna yes I'm gonna have to start sparring chips the following controls

141
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,800
appear to allow me to several viewpoints rotate zoom in and out oh thank

142
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,240
god that's what we need I must survive I need to familiarize myself with the

143
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:58,720
controls of my surrounding right zoom in and out yes right B means come to me X

144
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:07,840

controller yeah yes yeah astonishing the onion has sewn more seats the small

149
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:48,400
red pellets the pinkling harvested after cutting down that flower appears to be

150
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:55,120
some type of food that can proper propagate more picklings the onion seem

151
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,800
to have a sort of incubator needless to say I must study this strange life for

152
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,160
more right pick this up no I keep open in the wrong way no beaming's come to be

153

pinklings are as curious as children they form groups to perform tasks that

185
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,440
would be if possible for an individual a glimmer of hope has begun to shine in my

186
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,160
heart it is if I can make use of their skills perhaps I can fix my ship I shall

00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:38,720
into polyamory is so job I know are we it no you know with many Pikmin seeds

199
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,280
at once I find it rather tedious to pluck them from the ground my wife always

200
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,000
told me I was no good at routine tasks I guess I'll try and get it all done by

201
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,480
repeatedly tapping a until I pick them all follow the ground I've noticed that

202
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,960
when I add Pikmin to the group they become filled with excitement and blush

203
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,680
a bright red at other times they revert to a particular pale hue of a dim glow

204
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,480
play paying close attention to these differences is bound to help me

205
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:12,280
distinguish between Pikmin I'm spamming me I'm spamming me I'm spamming okay

called out money glitch like as if it was gta they deposit a check and before it

234
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,560
clears they take out the cash and then obviously it's like 23,000 in debt or

235
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,320
something and they were calling out money glitches if it was gta and I was like

236
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:23,360
this is the funniest thing I've ever heard check for it equals infinite money

237
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,480

244
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,680
special I'm pretty sure you already answered this but what is your first

was the first ever game I technically played but if you want to talk about my

247
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:37,240

252
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,960

253
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,560

259
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,840
back towards home my ship can once again lift off the glimmer of hope is

260
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:44,040
beginning to burn more brightly but what has become of the remaining parts that

261
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,840
search starts tomorrow I am treating myself so don't worry mama I will keep

262

266
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:25,560
I don't think we can go to space at the hall the fuselage hello oh yeah they're

267
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:33,120
following me the bugs they follow in me mom day one since impact I have something

268
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,280
managed to launch the dolphin but I was surprised to see the onion lift off with

269
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,360
me perhaps the Pikmin cannot survive overnight on the planet surface or have

270
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,440
they merely decided to join me for other reasons either way it seems like they

271
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,680
will help me again tomorrow the dolphin is missing 29 parts if I can't recover

272
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,320
them all I may never return home to my family on planet Hocko Teat Hocko Tat

273
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:01,680
analysis shows life support systems will only function so you can actually die

274
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,560
how can I repair my dolphin in such a short time a dense forest is visible on

275
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:11,160
the surface below as it holds the key to my survival I name it the forest of hope

276
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,160
I explore it tomorrow

277
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:25,800
population today's change in population lost in battle I put them to wars

278
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,120

279
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:42,680

281
00:29:52,240 --> 00:30:02,800

there though oh my gosh so they come with me my dolphin has returned to the

284
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,200
surface along with the Pikmin's onion being alone on this strange planet makes

285
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,520
me somewhat uneasy so I shall call the Pikmin out on the onion all I need to do

286
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,880

327
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:26,760
there's a guy I watch who does challenge runs of all sorts uh-huh he did one for this game

328
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:31,960
and when he realized he wasn't going to make it he built a fortress for his pigmen so they'd carry

329
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,560
on once he was gone that video still makes me a little weepy wait he like you get I can't believe

there's definitely stuff in the water

345
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,520

346

347
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:25,080
yeah I just come back I'm not sure right we have enough to bring the engine part back

00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:35,000
so we're just gonna do that for now oh my god look at my babies there's so many of you okay maybe

349
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,720

350
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:47,320
love having daughters I know it sounds really weird and vicar like obviously because I didn't

351
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:52,680
fucking birth them but like I feel that responsibility for their success like Mercy just celebrated

352
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,960
like 12,000 subscribers on Twitter and I'm just like oh my god I'm so fucking proud of you like

355
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,800
okay yeah you guys can sneak that's good those big ones are making me nervous though

356
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:24,440
can we do anything with this it doesn't look like it oh we can my clock has indicated the

357
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,960
coming of noon from now on I must pay close attention to the Sun meter on my monitor and

358
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,080
choose my actions accordingly so it's best for me to review my monitor's data across the top of my

359
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:38,040
monitor the Sun meter and day display at the bottom of my space put damage meter and Pikmin

360
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,920
gauges from the left these numbers reflect Pikmin under Pikmin in the field and total including

361
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:48,520
my onions to adjust the monitor I can press a little yes I've been mucking about the camera

362
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,240
water was shallow thank goodness mommy best mother what is this

363
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,800
they're twerking is twerking on it

364
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:03,720
what how is that not

365
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:20,760
ah okay we have to like build a pathways oh my gosh okay okay it's starting to click a little bit

366
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,440
a little bit so I'll grab those flowers and I'll grab that engine part

367
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:36,120
and then what we have to go in the spaceship at night or else they'll die carpenter links carpenter

368
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,560
I'm late to stream how many have been picked I accidentally killed one sadly because I didn't

369
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:49,320
understand yet fantastic work babies right you grab those for me beat them up beat them up beat

370
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:55,400
them up that flower is changing floor go grab them and grab that one

371
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:07,240
I love the noise we're making right we'll grab this engine part and then

372
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:16,760
that's it hop to three four hop to three four this game is so cute okay I'm starting to understand

373
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,520
why this is a beloved game this is adorable but it's only adorable when they don't die and I don't

374
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:29,960
know what to do about the big monster uh da tell them to attack this monster

375
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,000
I think I'm gonna have to I don't really want you to fight though

376
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,840
but I think if we want to progress

377
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:45,800
um uh I'm not sure what to do

378
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:52,760
large monster throw Pikmin on its back until it dies is that really I don't want to sacrifice my

379
00:40:52,760 --> 00:41:00,680
bubbies I'm getting nervous I guess the best I can do is literally just harvest everything

380
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,720
and then send them off for a fight but it's really not ideal

381
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,600
sorry I'm really struggling with the camera right they're gonna put that on the ship

382
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:24,520
okay we've got a new part we're gonna go beat up that a bug next

383
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:34,200
eternal field dynamo dynamo this should light things up no more candles I have never covered

384
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,840
to it there if I can find just three more I should be able to increase my ship's capability okay

385
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,480
uh are we missing

386
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:51,240
who are we missing someone's missing who what we're winning why

387
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:00,200
I can't see them it says I've got 78 on the board who are we missing

388
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:07,560
pinkling pinkling where are you where are you

389
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,560
where is he he's in the corner check the map

390
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:25,240
by the wall under the ship oh I see him oh my god you guys have better eyeballs than me

391
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:35,960
can't wake up right uh unfortunately it's war time I don't know how to do this without killing too many but

392
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,440
good luck babies I love you beat them up beat them up beat them up beat them up beat them up

393
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:49,320
no no no keep going they're one shot and they die it's inevitable to lose some pipe planes

394
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,760
it's a good idea to keep them alive as long as you can the older they get the stronger

395
00:42:54,760 --> 00:43:00,280
Pikmin get so fewer can do more you can tell they're growing because the leaf on their head

396
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:08,920
butson becomes a flower oh my god does it oh my god I lost seven in that fate that's actually

397
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:14,920
quite a lot oh my god there's another one right well just knock down this barrier I guess

398
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:25,640
we are very very good thank you anonymous I didn't know their head can become flower

399
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,560
god these monsters there's one right behind this door as well

400
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,080
should I keep exploring or should I go back

401
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,760
I think I should go back it looks like it's going to be the end of the day like I dilly

402
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,800
dallyed for too long

403
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,400
almost out of date yeah I was gonna let them destroy this wall and then come back to this map

404
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,240
you're supposed to take the big ones from behind was that not from behind

405
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:02,760
okay I feel like that one's a trap like if I send them to go kill that one we're not gonna make it

406
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,520
right come

407
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:15,080
right I can kind of investigate this tin a bit more just there is like bits on the floor I don't

408
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:23,880
know what that means no okay the tin isn't anything it's just details come right let's go back home

409
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:30,680
and sleep on it can I cross that body of water with them I think so they look like plants so you

410
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:39,240
know why would they drown that doesn't seem to make anything okay we've got 86 now that's not bad

411
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:50,920
they will drown how'd I get over there then curious curious curious oh sorry let's zoom out

412
00:44:51,080 --> 00:45:02,200
right everyone go home go home I don't know how to go home okay just like that my clock is indicating

413
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,040
the approach of sunset Pikmin waiting beneath the dolphin and onion will probably enter the

414
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,720
onion on their own but if I don't call the stragglers and add them they won't be able to get back

415
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:15,800
I am sure that the Pikmin still planted are safe but I am somewhat concerned about leaving Pikmin's

416
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:24,760
to defend from themselves in the dark right go up all of you go in the ship every single one of you

417
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:31,880
go beam him up scuddy and then I'm a go and mash it oh look at how cute these are

418
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,720
be mash it you previously attacked the big from the side which still works okay casualties underscore

419
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:50,440
mama okay okay thank you stash power I think I get um I'm union thank you chair as well uh

420
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,720
right I have recovered two 30 ship parts just three more parts will increase the dolphins

421
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:10,120
capabilities and repair my space so okay right lit can I go in can I go in no no no can we go in

422
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:17,720
call it night nope I just stand here and wait until the day's over

423
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,400
they're in the ship they're safe

424
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:29,720
yeah the Kenton's gonna make me nervous but I'm here

425
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,920
okay I'm learning okay we wait

426
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:44,920
well we got a new part that's the good thing I guess if we break down this wall here I think

427
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,400
they're strong enough to break down that wall now because I've got literally 86 which is opus work

428
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:55,880
yeah no stragglers

429
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:24,360
I'm sure there's like some oh that makes perfect sense

430
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:30,120
that makes perfect sense why they can't sit down today since impact it appears that many

431
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:34,280
of the ship's parts have landed in this region if I can just recover the parts of my radar I should

432
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:39,560
be able to use my radar screen how that would improve my chances that I'd only have to press

433
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:46,280
why to locate the parts hydration check I'm very dehydrated after that slumber

434
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:56,200
love me picklings yet dot dot dot there seems to be many hostile life forms if I am attacked and

435
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:00,680
my space suit takes damage I must return to my ship stand in front of it and press a to make

436
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:05,320
repairs as I explore must pay attention to my suit's damage meter in the bottom left corner of the

437
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:14,920
screen oh my god we even have graphs the show the pop no lost in battle a it was me I'm we could

438
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:25,720
have had 94 oh my babies I've betrayed you you trusted my my I've only got one part in this area

439
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:30,200
yeah something tells me we're gonna have to go back down in this region because that's rough

440
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:39,160
we salute the falling falling fall in pickling okay let's break down that stone wall because

441
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:46,680
there's a 20 seed bomb right there which will increase her a thingy's very much right you

442
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,160
let's bring the whole gang out

443
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:58,760
bunk hi scrawny hi reflin right we're getting a bit better over the camera angle haveage wait

444
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:04,840
it repaired the flowers come back I suppose if you completely twat yourself up with it right

445
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:10,200
everyone on the stone wall I will not take no for an answer beat the living daylights out of that

446
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:22,600
wall do you understand me keep going don't stop wait there's only so much they can do

447
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:31,880
wait they can't do it right they can't do it okay I guess right guess we'll go the other way then

448
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,600
right zoom out with this button

449
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:42,040
oh so if you twat up how many you need you have a chance to get more

459
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:57,960
oh my god I couldn't have bolster up harder if I tried I couldn't have bolster up harder if I tried

460
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:06,840
oh my god please right everyone respond oh my gosh why did they do that so they start attacking

461
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:18,680
the plant that was on the other side a panic my babies only have 77 there's a wall to break

462
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:27,960
oh my god you just ate gym they actually did though right what's this some part what

463
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,240
are these strong

464
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,040
now hold on a minute

465
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:50,040
are we introducing colors hold on you guys put that down I'm not sure it's time for you do that yeah

466
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:59,480
yellow is strong hello hi the color is different but it seems to be a Pikmin

467
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:05,000
nonetheless first glance it suggests this one has in some circles could be considered very

468
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:11,080
large ears it looks like it may weigh less than the others in what other way might this be different

469
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,920
no matter they are obviously quite similar so I this was Pikmin as well

470
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:25,960
they carry the bombs how do I tell this one in particular

471
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,800
remember each Pikmin has their own abilities depends on the color

472
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,040
okay how do I tell that I want the yellow one to do the bombs

473
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,920
I want the yellow one but he's at the back right fuck it everyone's getting sent until the yellow

474
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:51,000
one comes right come on surely there's definitely a better way to do this but hey oh

475
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:53,960
come on

476
00:52:54,200 --> 00:53:00,680
right and then bomb that

477
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,080
the glowing rocks in the yellow Pikmin picked up some explosive stones perhaps they know these

478
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:15,960
stones can be used as powerful weapons the bombs are dangerous so I must take care of using them but

479
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:21,560
these should be able to blast the stone walls and with blocked pathways okay okay

480
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:28,040
I must be vigilant just Pikmin I dismiss by pressing X bring their bombs when I call them back

481
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,360
Pikmin I throw wait I can kill

482
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:44,600
uh now hold on a minute I forgot when I was where did the where did the yellow one go I need it

483
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:49,640
oh my god did I just softlock myself

484
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,520

485
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:10,120

486
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:20,440
continued and stored uh did I just softlock myself

487
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,760

488
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:37,560

489
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,600

707
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:17,200
okay I'm not even gonna bother spawning in a new one I probably should like I shouldn't be lazy like

708
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:24,160
that but uh maybe I can tell these yellow ones to take these away I assume even though it's a red

709
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:38,640
button it doesn't make a difference or does it what does he do anything dangerous I hope not

710
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:41,440

I think they said if it was in the ground they're fine I think if they're in the ground they're fine

719
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:48,640

725
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,720
only took me how many tries at day three to get that far

day three three days since impact I now added yellow Pikmin to my list of discoveries these

733
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,280
creatures can wield bomb rockets so perhaps I can use them to blast down rock walls and open up new

734
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:34,480
regions red and yellow Pikmin as well as bomb carriers break into small it's so cute with that

01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:24,560
they're on top of it

803
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:31,440
oh that's far away is that getting knocked down

804
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:39,440
but yeah I got a polybook so what we're gonna do we're gonna open up a card pack and then I'm

805
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:44,400
gonna put it away in the polka deck so there'll be a longer hand cam stream hopefully doesn't

806
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:48,720
put anyone off I'll put my fake nails on okay I'll put my fake nails on because I'm such a girl

807
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:54,640
by the way I'm a girl I'm a real girl by the way I play games for male attention that's how you

808
01:33:54,640 --> 01:34:01,520
know I'm a real gamer hi Jason check we shouldn't joke because you know what's gonna happen

809
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:06,960
someone's gonna believe it like that one time I said that joking the person did believe it

810
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:16,240
shoni's a girl fake nails yeah I can't have like I can't have my nails longer I don't like it

811
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:22,240
will you be able to open them properly with the nails on yes I can still do everything with the

812
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:28,480
nails the only thing I can't do is WASD with the fake the like I used to get my nails actually

813
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:35,200
done the nails salon with my Vietnamese auntie that fucking yanked my toe give it back you bitch

814
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:42,400
um I used to like get them actually done it's called acrylic nails um and I love getting them

815
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:46,800
but oh my god she was so mean to me when I said I wanted them short she was like

816
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:54,800
honey what's the point and I'm like eh I'm a gamer that look like do I look like I'd be

817
01:34:55,600 --> 01:35:05,600
you know away from the water darlings oh there's something ahead right okay these two are these

818
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:13,200
are in cahoots okay guys these are in cahoots so come around come around that little come oh my god

819
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:18,960
we're gonna take casualties I'm sorry we're we're gonna have to take casualties all right jump him

820
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:26,720
first and if it wakes up the other guy that's on me no stop going for the fucking flowers go for

821
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:34,480
the big ass no no no he's shaking him off he's shaking it up shake it up did anyone die

822
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:43,120
no oh the he tanked it he tanked it oh no no no I did lose them oh is this gonna be

823
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:52,880
I can't uh he died okay that's good that's good come right there's a break there's bombs here for

824
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:59,600
some reason right I don't know how many you need to carry this but carry the fuck over I've cleared

825
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:04,960
the I have found the nova blaster this emits a dazzling burst of light capture capable of

826
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:09,680
destroying almost anything I'm not exactly sure about this but the promotional brochure claims that

827
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:18,000
it blasts can travel in this torrents of time and space smashing through stars okay they got eaten

828
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:24,800
I think I lost three I'm not sure so there's a bomb spawn here as well for when I need to

829
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:30,960
explore other areas of the map okay right let's get more picklings in

830
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:38,560
no not that one but sure you can take it it's fine you need three to carry that one

831
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:47,280
need ten to carry this one this game is quite satisfying when it comes to numbers it's like

832
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:58,000
yes yes I do have enough now hold on a minute hold on a minute do that one that one

833
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:08,320
and that one and then there we carry everything avoid the water though we need waterlings for that

834
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:16,480
oh there's a hole can I go in it oh it's a shark okay that makes more sense

835
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,880
that makes more sense that makes much more sense

836
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:28,080
it's just like a shortcut if you want to oh we did it we got two parts in one day

837
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:36,880
the seasick can use to attack them all at one I know what the seasick stick is

838
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:45,760
this is a weapon it has a strange allure like the hit feature bird generation want to be a word

839
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:53,760
indulge thank you thank you no I I know it pleases me increasing the dolphins capabilities my secret

840
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,880
and my search can now cover a wider area

841
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:03,840
well we're starting to look a bit more like a ship we're still a bit banged up though that's the only

842
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:12,160
problem it's just a wee bit banged up just a wee bit though veal or reference real

843
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:18,000
okay right now we need to go backtrack and make sure there's no

844
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:27,040
links that are left behind oh my god you you're exactly why I'm back here you little

845
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:33,440
you little thing you you little sheriff right since these guys are fully maxed out I'm actually

846
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:41,120
gonna pick them out oh my god we have 200 reeflings the army grows okay we're gonna take

847
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:47,680
bomb link you can come with us drop that motherfucking bomb though do not come to me with that bomb

848
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:55,840
do you understand right let's check we're gonna put them all away I don't I'd rather make sure

849
01:38:55,840 --> 01:39:01,600
everyone doesn't get left behind we're gonna go back that other way right everyone home

850
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:11,520
no there's only eight of years out lies everyone go home right now everyone in that ship

851
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:14,800
I have so many

852
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:23,040
did they all just come out of that ship no go in the ship

853
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:35,120
and then you all get inside don't you you left one at the shortcut I'll need to go back from

854
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:40,480
right who is walking with me red go go it's okay I'm gonna leave them if they're in the

855
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:42,320
ground because I know they're safe but

856
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:51,440
the shortcut shortcut there

857
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:59,760
I'm literally just spamming this any is here

858
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:07,680
no right no one's here that's good and then I'll do one more swipe around and then the rest might

859
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:17,360
be in the ground I'm trying I don't see him if he's around I'm coming for you inclin

860
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:26,560
our reeflings are oh I see you come get in the spaceship what are you playing at

861
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:30,480
you could have died out here you had me worried sick

862
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:36,640
right 27 doesn't seem right 27 seems like a really high number

863
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:42,480
I don't know have I left anyone has anyone been stuck on wall

864
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:51,280
I'm praying no one got stuck on a wall am I gonna die oh am I gonna die if I'm over here

865
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:56,560
I saw the shiny thing and I got lost literally

866
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:00,720
it says 26 Pikmin but there's none on the map

867
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:07,680
don't don't I'm actually they're in the ground you'll be fine if I'm left out

868
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:14,080
I'm running get to your ship oh my god you're stressing me child's game by the way

869
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:21,600
okay hopefully I don't lose any it says 26 on the ground is that what it says on the ground

870
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:35,440
oh is it like one last call and then whoever gets left behind gets left behind

871
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:44,720
oh that's rough that's mean that's cruel I guess because they don't have brains

872
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,560
have a lot more in common with the pink things than I thought

873
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:54,160
okay we're gonna go like top left now

874
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:01,120
day four since impact with the it's newly increased the dolphin now lifts higher into the planet's

875
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:04,560
atmosphere I see a great depression in the woods beneath me it looks like a belly button in the

876
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:10,240
vast forest now that is my ship is more stable I should be able to set it down there is that where

877
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:18,400
we unlock a lost in bat all right but I never left any behind let them know nothing got right I

878
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:23,920
assume the blue ones are on this next location and then we come back to previous maps right

879
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:31,360
we come back to previous maps oh my god why does this look so scary though the forest navel

880
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:37,840
hydration check no man left behind exactly

881
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:46,000
exactly hold on I'm just gonna check I think Shivi doesn't feel well so she can see and she's not

882
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:53,280
feeling very well today when is emmer's getting on I I promise I want to stream more I'm actually

883
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:59,600
getting a bit nervous about my inspection because I'm like um what do you want from me

884
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:07,040
those are boss battles in this game oh there are but there's boss but

885
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:11,600
with what my army of tiny little adorable squishies

886
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,560
is there a boss battle in this level

887
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:25,280
never leave any behind otherwise it will show them running away like the big one from the big

888
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:36,400
ones because you can take off and get eaten that is so sad whoever whoever made this game you've

889
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:42,560
got you're sick you're twisted in the mind why would you show us that thank you stash power

890
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:51,440
why would they show us that that's so cruel oh by the way you failed in gathering the the little

891
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:57,040
guys you will now watch them they'll perish they'll suffer they'll be in a lot what

892
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:02,800
love is going to cry this kid's going to throw right I'm just going in this I assume this is

893
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:08,720
where the blue ones are so we're going to go get it we're going to get to it the forest

894
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:17,600
Neva I love this game so much that I hate or cry for anyone who dies my poor little things right

895
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:23,440

01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:47,200
like we're going to be doing loads of fights right first things first let's break down this wall

899
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:56,560
go go go go go beat it up beat it up gorgeous stunning 10 at 10 effort this is a water map

01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:03,840
if I've ever seen one where is that log that I can break the only log I'd be breaking is on

901

995
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:06,800
thinking you should probably go grab the blue onion I don't know where the blue onion is

996
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:09,040
is it on this map

997
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:15,200
you've got your space pieces so you can pack up early if you want

998
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:21,840
I'm just gonna check it is nearby blue I need to go through the water

999
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:28,000
I'm just gonna check those stragglers because they're getting caught on the map

1000
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:31,520
well can you be that young

1001
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:44,320

1003
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:55,360

1004
01:56:58,880 --> 01:56:59,840
come on come on

1005
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:06,720
bed now I'm not having any stragglers because these are getting caught on things

1006
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:11,440
bed right and then I'm gonna take a shortcut and go this way

1007
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:17,200
something blue you just saw it I just saw it this blue area

1008
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:24,240
oh I thought that was a par and I needed the blue onions to unlock it

1009
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:35,040
okay we have a seedling I'm gonna pluck it and I'm gonna get it to get these ones in the immediate

1010
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:44,400
vicinity okay we're doing it can you tell us a bedtime story once upon a time there was

1011
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:50,080
the story of a brave little reefling this is more like a drumming honestly because you can't

1012
01:57:50,080 --> 01:58:00,320
drum this is a pigment of yet another color near this one's cheeks what all face cheeks is what

1013
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:05,440
appears to be a set of girls this trait suggests to me that it can the blue type of pigment can

1014
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:12,320
enter without any trouble there's only one way to find out oh my gosh I got nervous there yeah

1015
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:19,600
go for the flower yeah that's what you're supposed to do the flower I'm so sorry I was like excuse me

1016
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:21,440
right and then go pick that up

1017
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:32,560
I was like aren't these things a bit too cute and adorable to be mucking about with cheeks

1018
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:38,720
right if I leave these guys in the ground it'll be fine right

1019
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:47,600
right you you go up in your spaceship I'm gonna leave the others in the ground to mature well

1020
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:55,440
you're so mature for your age um and then I'm gonna go back to my spaceship and we officially

1021
01:58:55,440 --> 01:59:06,880
unlock the white the water blue ones the scissors 29 on the hood get in the fucking stop eating nectar

1022
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:17,840
on your time off making me nervous yes it's fine go to bed eating nectar on your tech I can't believe

1023
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:23,840
it you don't think I pay you enough actually I don't pay you at all check the map if there's any

1024
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:32,240
left behind had I even checked them out no there's none left behind don't do that to me that's the

1025
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:40,320
seedlings okay that's the seedlings I feel like I need to install a mod that just gives you infinite

1026
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:52,880
time there's a red where a red one no I'm about to leave one behind no where I didn't see it

1027
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:57,280
oh no do we need to watch it die

1028
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:08,320
no surely not copy them absolute copy them they're not gonna make me watch one singular red one die

1029
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:17,760
right oh no we get away in the safety of our nest

1030
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:32,000
no no baby no no you got flung like a fucking pancake

1031
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:39,040
deep in the forest cave I discovered blue pics and these yellow these blue fellows have something

1032
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:44,320
resembling gills on their cheeks they appear to be amphibious surviving both in water and land

1033
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:53,040
the wonders of nature never ceases to stun me even in this alien land oh I'm distraught I can't believe

1034
02:00:53,760 --> 02:01:03,280
we've lost in battle 18 I had to watch his little body get smushed by a frog

1035
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:11,200
that's so mean I know the game guys probably are trying to encourage you not to thingy so now

1036
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:17,760
that we have blue unlocked will we get all the parts in this area is my question

1037
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:23,360
I think so

1038
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:30,560
it died being sat on it's what it would have wanted yes you can get everything

1039
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:37,680
ah don't cry for my mommy I was a willing sacrifice no my poor baby

1040
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:46,080
uh hey there's hope I'm not late and how well did you sleep I got 11 hours of sleep which means

1041
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:51,120
I did nothing behind the scenes oh yeah okay we're gonna take out the blue

1042
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:55,600
oh no the other ones are germinating on the planet

1043
02:01:57,040 --> 02:02:06,240

1093
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:23,840
it's a bit pernickety for me but that's just how it is like that's how games are

1094
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:31,520
like they can't even make it super easy or else you know you wouldn't have the motivation to play it

1095
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:36,240
but like going kind of back and forth a little bit with the claws who's your claws any claws

1096
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:43,360

1109
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:15,760
it's the shock absorber the apparatus that the shaking and swing that normally occurs in flight

1110
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:21,600
still I don't have enough I don't really want to send them to a fight either but

1111
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:27,200

see no one died because I'm a good mummy promise right we'll do one more we'll do one more day

1167
02:16:52,560 --> 02:17:00,640
we're gonna grab those two two thingamabobbers uh in the flower at night that's cute I have seen

1168
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:04,560
that at the leaf atop of Pikmin's head will grow into a bud and then flower appears that if they do

1169
02:17:04,560 --> 02:17:10,080
not pick the specimens sprouts they gradually bloom overnight fantastic okay I found the increased

1170
02:17:10,080 --> 02:17:15,200
swiftness of the flower Pikmin to be tremendous benefit also my diligent observation has recorded

1171
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:20,720
instances in which flower Pikmin lost in battle have left seats behind this is why on days after

1172
02:17:20,720 --> 02:17:27,360
fierce battles I occasionally have new sproutlings okay well it'd be okay with inspection I have

1173
02:17:27,360 --> 02:17:32,000
time it's just they're fucking assholes and picked nine like the earliest time I was like can you do

1174
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:42,160
it as late as possible and they were like sorry sorry I'm like what do you mean sorry sorry sorry

1175
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:47,200
we have to do it as early as possible I'm like okay well like I can say fucking no

1176
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:55,120
seedlings we're so back ASMR 98 no the ASMR was supposed to be in tourist time

1177
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:00,560
but I forgot I had the freaking instruction so I would kind of need to do it now

1178
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:04,800
controversial that would have to do it like right like enough

1179
02:18:05,680 --> 02:18:18,560
okay 15 right and then there's 15 in the space right we have the 30 we can move it now

1180
02:18:19,360 --> 02:18:23,680
and we can move it but they need to be able to win that fight as well

1181
02:18:25,200 --> 02:18:31,360
because they're going to move the plant across where that band pot is right they're going to jump

1182
02:18:31,360 --> 02:18:39,440
down this ledge with him I'm like 99% sure they are and they all need to get past this thing

1183
02:18:39,440 --> 02:18:43,520
did they not play test this like come on they're getting stuck you need to like come over a bit

1184
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:49,760
I suppose I can tell these ones to be unresponsive and then these ones keep trying to come up

1185
02:18:50,560 --> 02:18:57,680
right come together math thank you for the 10 gifted memberships math 16 18 pythagoras theorem

1209
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:44,480

1213
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:16,960
that I didn't fucking name them because we were struggling with two people one of the concept

1214
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:22,480
arts had a really good first name but there's a very popular vtuber with that first name

1234
02:24:36,640 --> 02:24:42,160
because I'd be I'd be slamming and inking and stuff shocking I actually I will say one thing

1235
02:24:42,160 --> 02:24:47,760

1248
02:26:17,440 --> 02:26:23,600
increase the numbers of them again I'll give them a few extra so they hurry along we're midday now

1249
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:29,200
but we've just picked up two parts today which is really good and we would need to fight our

1250
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:32,800
way past to get that other one and it's getting a bit close to the end of the day

1251
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:40,960
I don't know actually tell you what I'm gonna go exploring on my own because there was something

1252
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:51,120
there was a show girl her name was Lola but that was 30 years ago when they used to have a show

1253
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:58,480
oh waterlings okay waterlings break a barrier got it got it I'll see if I can grab some waterlings

1254
02:26:58,480 --> 02:27:05,200
to break this like right now we'll finish up this map maybe shock absorber this nifty okay

1255
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:10,880
the my only if I play another map my only note is the ASMR is gonna be like one hour long I'll

1261
02:27:52,480 --> 02:27:57,680
to be attacked by when we go on the other side of this wall surely surely surely cope them

1262
02:27:58,720 --> 02:28:03,280
right at least break down this barrier and then we'll see what's behind it because there's a part

1263
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:09,760
behind here come on keep it up keep it up beat it up beat it up beat it up beat it up come on

1265
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:26,720
lot of space you strike a hard deal it's gonna be a yapping stream enemy real true just move the

1266
02:28:26,720 --> 02:28:34,640
ASMR moment no I moved around so much membership last week I feel really bad about it I feel really

1268
02:28:42,080 --> 02:28:47,040
can't remember what I put I put up so many rooms like so quickly I listen to music when I put my

1269
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:51,680
rooms up and sometimes I'll accidentally take the lyric of the song that I'm listening to and the title

1270
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:59,040
I just like making things harder for myself clearly put my members boat down as completely happy

1271
02:28:59,040 --> 02:29:03,120

02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:52,560
now I say break the wall but we're going straight back home

1278
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:57,040
I'm bringing in all 100 of my recruits I'm not even kidding

1279
02:29:57,440 --> 02:30:02,960
how do we I assume I just throw 100 at them

1280
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:10,800
oh my gosh that's a boy that's a boss fight all right

1281
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:17,440
that thing is no joke be careful I can deplete my army

1282
02:30:18,080 --> 02:30:26,720
I want the doctor Robotnik is that it looks like a tank I assume I just send multiple colors at it

1283
02:30:26,720 --> 02:30:29,360
and it doesn't really matter

1284
02:30:34,800 --> 02:30:38,400
yeah we're getting a bit close to the end of the day either you guys break this barrier we're

1285
02:30:38,400 --> 02:30:43,280
going home yes that's like a bit more

1286
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:49,280
if we get to that last thought I think I'm I'm taking her home

1287
02:30:50,720 --> 02:30:57,680
you might as well leave the blues won't break it our blues like weaker the glowing mouth is not

1288
02:30:57,680 --> 02:31:05,200
for sucking looks like it'll just suck them all up like a vacuum so I should send in reds

1289
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:07,840
go home don't risk it right come on darlings

1290
02:31:15,440 --> 02:31:19,200
I'm not gonna take the shortcut whoa don't do that to me that scares me

1291
02:31:21,360 --> 02:31:31,360
everyone bed now do I make myself clear bed right we've got 30 blues not the worst could be worse

1292
02:31:31,440 --> 02:31:39,040
but not the worst you know reds get in my army of beautiful reds and you go blue I see you

1293
02:31:41,600 --> 02:31:47,680
randomly getting stuck on stuff I really do not have a lot right and then reds I'm gonna pop

1294
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:58,400

1295
02:32:00,800 --> 02:32:02,000
okay go home

1296
02:32:04,960 --> 02:32:09,600
and there's no I don't even have time to see if I've left any behind

1297
02:32:09,920 --> 02:32:16,880
oh I just hope I've got 230 so yes mommy honking

1298
02:32:16,880 --> 02:32:21,120
red pickpins are the strongest check the map I mean it's too late I can't even go after we'll

1299
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:28,160
have purples are in this game right they can breed amongst themselves oh no wait what do you mean

1300
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:37,840
oh no no there's nothing left out you love their little voices let me be red ones deal 50% more

1301
02:32:37,840 --> 02:32:41,120
damage than other okay we're sending the red into the boss fight

1302
02:32:45,920 --> 02:32:50,720
there's more colors in the later variation games is what I'm trying to ascertain

1303
02:32:52,400 --> 02:32:56,480
goodbye thank you for hanging enjoy your dindins as well

1304
02:32:58,720 --> 02:33:02,480
right we'll do this boss fight and then I'm just praying

1305
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:07,840
that sounds like a straw

1306
02:33:12,640 --> 02:33:17,920
and that sounds like the balutro background music I'm feeling a bit agamba coming on day seven

1307
02:33:17,920 --> 02:33:22,640
the pickpins always carry their prey on to the onion close observation indicates that taking

1308
02:33:22,640 --> 02:33:27,520
food pellets the onion of the same color result in a release of larger numbers of the sea

1309
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:32,160
oh I was gonna say I was like I don't really seem to have any issues with the claws

1310
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:37,520
okay red is up yellow maintained and blue went up a smidge

1311
02:33:41,200 --> 02:33:44,640
all right we're gonna I don't know how many we're gonna lose in this great war but

1312
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:54,640
we'll find out right time for a war time for a war did someone say gambling let's go gambling

1313
02:33:55,440 --> 02:33:59,920
I have been in the balutron I'm so mad I don't like that membership stream

02:34:01,520 --> 02:34:06,240
is that right we all reds all day baby all reds all day

1315

1317
02:34:24,720 --> 02:34:28,640
I won their first experience on the field to be fucking insta there

1318
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:33,360

1324
02:35:02,480 --> 02:35:02,980

1442
02:48:27,980 --> 02:48:32,900

1443
02:48:32,900 --> 02:48:39,620
not like supermarket something there I oh yeah I'm definitely playing the full

1444
02:48:39,620 --> 02:48:43,580
TCG game I feel looks like they've put loads of more stuff in it I had so much

1445
02:48:43,580 --> 02:48:50,260
fun playing that card opening shop thing I think it goes to sunset it advances to

1446
02:48:50,260 --> 02:48:58,500
the next day okay let's do that yes mm-hmm mm-hmm right we'll get the last

1447
02:48:58,500 --> 02:49:09,420
piece on this map then I can say I've 100% completed Pikmin on one level you

1448
02:49:09,420 --> 02:49:13,340
do love to see store I don't know I just find it I really enjoy like money up

1449
02:49:13,340 --> 02:49:17,340
kind of games where it feels satisfying like you start with like a rundown don't

1450
02:49:17,340 --> 02:49:21,140
like if I ever do get to making my own games don't be surprised if it's like

1451
02:49:21,140 --> 02:49:26,140
some rundown store and and you need to fix the business or else they're gonna go

1452
02:49:26,260 --> 02:49:31,580
bus type thing and then the game turns out you destroy like massive corporations

1453
02:49:31,580 --> 02:49:36,260
thank you I'll be here for all day I read every decent flint beetle this

1454
02:49:36,260 --> 02:49:39,900
creatures hypnotic reflatic body is quite hard given a good defense against

1455
02:49:39,900 --> 02:49:44,260
Pikmin attacks why then do the Pikmin chase them in such a friendly I wonder

1456
02:49:44,260 --> 02:49:51,220
if it will undergo any changes if I hit it directly with a Pikmin I don't I don't

1457
