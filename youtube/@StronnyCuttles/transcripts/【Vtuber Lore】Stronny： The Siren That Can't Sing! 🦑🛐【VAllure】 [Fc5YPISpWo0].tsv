480	6560	Growing up in the open seas, there are stories told of the monsters that lurked below,
7200	15440	deadly Leviathans, monstrous serpents, yet no giant could hope to match the lethal efficiency
15440	26480	of one such creature, equal in elegance incarnate, so alluring yet so deadly, so hypnotically fatal
26480	36400	as the siren, the succubi of the sea, the witch of the waves, the black widows of the, uh, black sea,
37120	43680	a maiden with a hypnotic gaze that warped the wills of even the most salt-seasoned captains,
43680	47920	and a song that commanded the crews of even the most loyal sailors.
48560	54880	My mother would read me these tales before bed, tales of aquatic femme fatales that lured men to
54880	62640	sail themselves to their blood-soaked watery graves. These horrific tales of nautical nefariousness
62640	72080	would keep me up at night. They made me feel so, so inspired. I mean, my people used to do that?
72080	78480	That's so cool. I mean, I've never fed on a human before, and the smartest thing I've ever hypnotized
78480	85440	is a seal. But learning that my ancestors used to eat humans by the literal boatloads was amazing.
85440	91360	I couldn't wait to grow up and eat my fill, fat ones, tall ones, skinny ones, even hairy ones.
92240	100960	Though I learned our people aren't as feared by humans as they once were. My ocean, my home, humans
100960	108080	to fail it with their presence. Worse still, they tossed their filth into it, further insulting us.
108800	114640	How could this have happened? How were we brought so low from our past? They used to tell legends on
114640	120160	every port that made even the most straight-laced superstition scoffing marines keep in the back
120160	125360	of their minds. They would dedicate figureheads of their ships in respect to our beautiful yet
125360	132560	delicate bodies. They put us on every map. But now? Ugh, disgusting humans.
133760	139920	One night, I envisioned a genius plan, the first strike in my crusade against the human world.
142080	147360	I would infiltrate in hijack a fishing vessel and use it as my own pirate vessel with a crew of
147360	154080	hypnotized thralls. I was going to wage a once siren war against all of humanity. It was going to
154080	161200	be perfect, and I definitely would have won. That was until I envisioned a plan that was even more
161200	169360	perfect. Er, well, at least more time efficient. Making my way below deck, I made a strange discovery.
170080	178240	The humans were hypnotized by their own choice. I couldn't believe it. I looked at boat after boat,
178240	185920	these humans charmed like a siren's spell, even dedicating their lives to their chosen idols.
185920	194400	These idols they fawn over were these sirens too. That's it. That's the secret to defeating the humans.
194400	199840	I'm going to find the secret to their magic and harness this power myself and bring power back
199840	206720	to my people. I must gather fame, fortune, scandals, anything and everything to grow my influence over
206720	212800	mankind to bring sirens back into the minds of the people. But I'm not just going to tip the
212800	221920	scales. I'm going for complete domination. Every human will bend to my will. All will be cheering
221920	227920	for their own demise. I will be the instrument of karmic justice. The world will worship me and
227920	234400	praise my name as I bring about their end. I will march every human under my control into the ocean,
234400	239680	and my people will chant my name as they have a feeding frenzy that has written into legend.
243520	252640	Though that's a very long-term goal. With every big venture, whether business-wise or lifestyle,
252640	270880	every big undertaking starts small scale, right? Hmm. So, I think I'll start with you.
