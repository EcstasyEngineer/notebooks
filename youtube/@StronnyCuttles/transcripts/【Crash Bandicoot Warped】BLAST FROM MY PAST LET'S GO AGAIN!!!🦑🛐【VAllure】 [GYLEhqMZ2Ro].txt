Mummy, the mummy hasn't abandoned no thing.
Mummy is in a foolish, foolish streamer.
When I did the footstream, I put my ring light,
I had to move my ring light so I could,
a little bit of shit and it would be done with the wall.
As it eliminate that mummy started streaming on her hands and knees,
it's not what she did.
Oh, I need the ring light.
The thing that's happening is the goofy and it's jumping about everywhere.
Everyone, hold on.
Oh, but it's going to be light.
Please, it's going to be light.
Okay.
Alright, my face is eliminated.
I'm also on reactive mode, so I'm actually going to react to the game.
Everyone knows I have an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080,
with 10,067 megabits.
Hello, good morning.
Let me put on live chat, any live chatter.
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.
I apologize if I sound tired.
I passed out after that RuneScape stream,
and I woke up 45 minutes ago.
I hope Icy's monetization stream went fantastic.
I believe Emmys is also today,
so if there's any pin pals or snowberries,
they're down the hall.
Into the lift.
I apologize if I sound tired.
I am exhausted.
I don't know how.
I slept for so long.
I don't know what earth is going on with me.
But I've got cup of tea, I've got two waters,
I've got a wee muffin,
and then we can jump into Crash Bandicoot.
As for any updates, since I slept,
I have absolutely nothing.
A Riefling sent me a three page story,
which I really liked,
but for legal reasons,
I cannot speak any of it here.
I've also put together a little folder of Bibbius,
which I don't know why I didn't think to do earlier.
But now, now I'm putting it all together.
Oh, and a Riefling sent me a five minute audio.
And he was like, talk, yeah.
I was like, oh my God,
Rieflings are getting so brave, honestly.
And before I die a lot, probably,
probably, I'm not even going to put it behind me.
I don't know what level the desktop,
how loud the game's going to be compared to me,
but give me a three page story.
It was about me, obviously.
But yes, you guys have been doing fantastic.
I believe AC's doing well.
There's, I don't really have any updates
about anything else at the moment.
Other than my freaking ASMR meme video,
I've got 30 key views and I'm like, right,
this has definitely left the target audience,
because I had 5,000 subscribers when I posted that,
and now we're at 6,000.
I'm like, bro, that like propelled my channel.
So I'm waiting,
Mercy's is going to go up after the stream
or, or it's going to go up after
she finishes her stream today.
And then AC's is ready to go up.
I may, actually, I'm going to message her
right now so she can reply to me.
Now let's see, when you finished stream,
do you want me to upload your meme ASMR
on your behalf question mark?
And before you're like, wait,
why are you asking the girls permission
to do stuff that you made for them?
Because it's their channels.
I don't want them to be unhappy.
I want them to be happy little ducklings with me.
Who up?
Bandy their cooter.
Whoa.
Okay.
I'm getting a bit too close with that one.
Any Bandy girls.
It's running such a sweetheart.
Yes, I don't want to do anything that upsets the girls.
And if they're like, no,
now's not the time to upload the meme ASMR.
I won't upload the meme ASMR.
That's fine.
So I'll get permission from them
and then possibly after the stream.
Apparently it takes eight hours to do this game.
Now, I'm going to just say,
I was a atom when I played this game.
I have barely any recollection.
My dad didn't buy it for me.
He bought it for himself.
Johnny, congrats on 6.5K.
No, I also made ASMR videos.
I was going to try and get my first thank you video out.
Or maybe after a buckshot roulette after the doc.
Because I've got buckshot roulette.
Then I've got a couple of hours.
Then I go to the doctor.
Is this a rhythm game?
It is not.
It's Crash Bandicoot.
It is an adventure platformer.
I know you can't hear the background of the game right now.
So it's just my voice in this room.
Do forgive.
Johnny, when in a gang?
Any ganky desks?
Hold on.
Let me hydrate with my tea.
I owe so much ASMR.
I do have it all recorded.
I just need to sit and edit it.
And I can't upload the clapping without
using my hands ASMR.
Yet.
I need to have some things in between it.
Strongly winning much in everything, right?
It's a never-ending move.
Every time she releases an ASMR, she gains 1K
and she gets to go back to square one.
Honestly, I'm like, I hope not.
I think it will definitely calm down a bit.
It's going to have to calm down.
Because as much as our capitalist overlords
love infinite growth, that's just not plausible here.
Is it something that is healthy or thingy?
Because if you start measuring yourself by numbers
and that kind of thing, that's when...
I think that's when VTubers probably get it in their head.
They're like, oh, I'm not doing well enough.
I'm not performing well enough.
And it's like, brav.
You haven't even given yourself a chance.
Just have fun.
People can tell you're sweating on trends
if you're trying to sweat on trends, you know?
And then people can tell when you're just memeing around
or you're just memeing around, you know?
And guess what?
Some streamers...
Sorry, this is just turning into a philosophical...
Let's digest and get to the roots of why streamers are streamers.
Some people are just...
What's the word?
Optimised to have a nice, cosy, tight-knit community.
Some people, some of your personalities, other streamers,
you're just supposed to have a nice little tight-knit community.
You're not supposed to be for the masses, you know?
So don't always be reaching for the fricking stratosphere, the stars.
Don't always be reaching for the stars when you do just fine in the stratosphere, you know?
Every time you gain 1k, you release an ASMR that gains you 1k.
It's an infinite feedback loop you'll be at.
Infinity subs by the end of the week.
Not quite.
Especially those looking to extract numbers from TikTok
that only have 100 subs but say they deserve a million views on every post.
Yes.
I can actually get into the psychology on why people
feel they deserve subscribers
versus others who feel unworthy
of what they get because of what they've done.
I could definitely go on an algorithm stream that in...
Not tinfoil time!
No, it's not tinfoil! It's not tinfoil!
It's not tinfoil.
It's like actually, it's like human psychology
as well as the damage that the internet does to the mind.
Because if you didn't know, you're actually not supposed to be exposed to...
I think you're not supposed to actually know more than 100 faces at once.
And your brain is just not wired for any other way.
After that, your brain can only be wired to recognize tribes,
which sounds terrible, but that's just how it is.
So it's like, ah, I am approaching the AC clan, you know?
Or the tribe.
Are you studying psychology?
Absolutely not.
I have had enough of education.
I'm not...
I say that I might be going back to beauty school,
but that's for...
I'm talking like five years down the line beauty school type thing.
Because I might want to run an ASMR room studio type thing.
But that's just me.
That's just me.
Neither tinfoil hat or more.
Do the reeflings?
Honestly, I'm so down for that.
I need the meds to moat back.
I need the thigh gripper moat back.
All other emotes that I need back.
I was actually going to ask if a reefling has any batch to emotes,
wink, wink, if you could send me a cat box file of the batch itself.
So I know what to reorder.
Because I picked what I wanted.
Just so you know.
Just so we're all on the same...
I picked what I wanted.
Oh yeah, Crash Bandicoot 3.
Yes, so I was bought an atom and my dad bought this game for himself.
And the only thing I remember doing on this game is playing Coco on China
and using the horse all the time.
Eh, the horse?
The tiger all the time.
Eh, I'll have to catch stream later as I'm working on 80 slides of insurance termed out.
Ooh!
Even the thought of that is terrible.
I don't know what's going on with my tees.
I've not been enjoying them as of late.
I'm getting a bit...
I'm getting nervous.
I'm getting a bit shaky why I'm not enjoying my tees.
Because normally I'm all over them.
Although I have been enjoying this fruit juice company thing
and they put loads of fruit in the juice
and then they juice it
and then I drink the juice
and then I get all the goodness in me.
Yeah.
I've had too many teas.
This is a very plausible and realistic sense.
Although I've only had one tea the day.
I literally only...
I woke up like...
Well, I woke up an hour ago now.
I woke up, spammed the PC on,
started spamming pre-chat for a few moments,
checked out AC to see what's going on with her.
She's fine.
Checked out the Discord to see if the girls are fine.
They're fine.
Refillings lacking flavour lately.
You're not enjoying the tea because it's all just special, aren't you?
Oh my god.
It sounds terrible, but should I just get a cola?
I don't think drinking a cola first thing in the morning
is a good idea, though.
It's a terrible idea.
Okay, let's get into Crash Bandicoot.
Any Crash Bandicooters?
Is that too loud?
Or is that fine?
Oh my god.
How do I leave?
Oh, my controller isn't even awake.
Hold on.
Yeah, plug my controller in.
So there's three games in it.
I've only ever played Warped.
I don't know what the other two are about.
I guess the game.
Override save.
Is it too loud?
Guys, groovy as anything.
Maybe turn it down a little.
Okay, I'll do it in the start menu after the cutscene.
We're crashing?
I guess we are called Crash Bandicoot.
Thank you.
Free at last.
Oh my god, that's so beautiful.
Oh, it kind of looks like a snowberry.
Ooga, ooga is free.
No, it cannot be.
Evil, great evil has come.
Oh my god, this is so beautiful, this game.
Bandicoot.
Wait, it's a Tiki Mask, like Earth Tiki Mask.
I know we've had a few unfortunate setbacks.
Insane.
Insane.
Oh, I don't remember any of this.
Fuck it.
That was a flashbang first thing in the morning.
Did you see that?
I can't see anymore.
Oh my god, this game is so beautiful and cool.
For real, I think I just got a virus.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, I remember something like that.
Oh my gosh, that was so beautiful.
Wait, hold on.
I need to turn down the volume a little bit.
My apologies.
Game option, music 8.
Wait.
I could do this all day.
We'll do 8s.
Oh my god.
Oh wait, you can't control the camera angle.
What does Y do?
Y shows me my light, what does B do?
No.
Oh my god, POV, I'm coming for AC.
I'm a Snow Berry going for AC.
Oh my god, on the prowl, on the prowl.
Oh my god, this is so precious.
This is so cool.
Oh my god, wait, I remember these symbols a little bit.
Oh look, I have a mask helping me too.
No.
I'll find out which one is more powerful.
Soon enough.
I mean, it's more powerful because I'm the goodie.
You're the baddie.
Oh my god.
Wait, where does this work?
Oh my god.
Oh my god, this is like, you can.
Oh my god, we flints, we're already on the farm.
10 out of 10 game, we're already on the farm.
Right, how do I do that?
To jump, to spin, to crouch for inventory.
Why would I need to see my inventory?
I guess if you're going for like 100%, but...
Wee!
Oh my god, we can bomb.
This game is beautiful.
I remember that I don't need to hurt it.
Oh no, we spanked the goat.
Right, we spanked it.
We didn't kill it.
We spanked it away.
Okay, it's fine.
What's this?
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Oh no.
Thank you for the 5.
Okay, I can definitely take full damage.
Oh my...
Checkpoint!
I'm remembering.
Wait, go back on the farm.
What does this do?
Okay, if you hit it at a certain time.
Oh my god, we're on the farm.
Right, frogs.
Frogs can hurt us.
Go back on the farm, where you belong.
Go ahead.
Oh my god, I can spank everyone.
Oh, I love this game.
Wait, how about if I get 2 to go because...
Oh, he's glowing.
Oh, you are glowing.
What the heck is it?
What did I do?
Where am I going?
Oh no.
What's this?
Oh, it's bone.
I got an achievement for doing this.
It's a bonus level.
Wow, what?
Bum bum bum.
Bum bum bum.
Is this just like free apples?
Oh my apples.
I never picked them up.
Oh my god, that's so cool.
Who found the dream?
The bleeding hearts are getting spanked.
For real.
A wimpa fruit.
A wimpa fruit.
One puff fruit.
Go back to the farm.
Oh, we trick shot with it.
The bleeding heart.
We trick shot it.
Go back to the farm.
No frog for Gen 2.
Uh...
Oh my god, Sheebie really wants a slim girl for Gen 2.
I don't know how to break it to her.
She really wants a Gen 2.
I'm just like, maybe I'll give Sheebie a Halloween outfit.
Wait, have we already been here before?
Or is this just kind of the same layout?
Okay, and it's spanked.
What?
Pink!
Why is there a gap in this bridge?
We need someone who works with stone to fix the bridge.
We need someone who works with stone to fix the bridge.
No slim girl?
No, maybe I'll give Sheebie a slim Halloween outfit.
How about that?
Slim girls.
I get the...
Oh, wait, so if you miss it, you'll...
Okay!
I missed a box!
Stinky, I don't know where it was.
Slim girls are my favorite monster girl.
Oh, but slimes are hot.
I'm not sure.
I don't know.
Oh, they came out of my earhole.
Oops.
And then we just go back in Ninja 2?
Oh my gosh, that's cool.
This game is easy.
I like how fun and easy it is.
Lamia is all my favorite.
I would entertain a Lamia.
Oh, the fisher thing.
To kick fast.
Whoa!
Whoa! Okay, wait, that was very dumb.
Sorry. That was incredibly dumb.
Whoa!
This game is so pretty.
Sorry.
I've not got much accuracy under the war,
even though I'm a cuttlefish.
I don't want to...
That just like will pass them.
Wait, that's a checkpoint.
Oh my gosh!
I remember something like this.
I used to be so scared of it as a child.
I thought I only remembered Coco.
Oh!
I can hear a box back there.
Wait, what does that shark do?
Please email him.
Oh, there's a sand dollar.
On the ground.
Wow, there's...
Jeez, this game is so cute.
I can't believe I didn't play this before.
Well, I mean...
Sorry, I got scared.
I don't know if I can hurt those pufferfish.
Checkpoint.
Why checkpoint?
What's here that shouldn't be here?
Is there something below that's going to kill me?
Because why did I get a checkpoint?
You can switch to play Coco!
Oh!
Oh my gosh!
What? I don't wonder this game did so good.
It's like so creative.
Oh, there is hidden boxes under the coral reef!
That's okay.
We're not going for 100%
because I don't know how to 100% this game.
But we can go for lots of fruit.
Okay, yummy yummy fruit.
Oh, I can beat shark up in this.
And I can explode things in this.
Let's go.
Oh no, I broke it.
I'm sorry.
I'm a bit of a klutz. I accidentally broke it.
Dun dun dun.
Oh wait, that's not the song anymore.
It's whatever the underwater.
Sure, we'll get these boxes.
I think it's safe for now.
Oh my god.
What do you mean I'm so in love with a game
that's got the difficulty for literal children?
I can't believe it.
The accusations are unfounded.
I play Skyrim on Legendary mode just because you can.
It doesn't mean you need to be...
Wait, can I hurt this?
Oh no, I can beat up the little puffer fish.
Oh, the purple puffers.
Okay, there we go.
Well, there's the prank crystal.
Okay, let's get it.
Wait, is that going to explode?
Oh wow!
If you don't do it in time, it becomes a solid.
Okay, that's curious.
Is it hard to get 100%?
Oh, I missed a lot of boxes this time.
Didn't do that good this time.
That's okay.
I'm happy just loving everything.
The scene remains me so much of Jack and Dax though.
Jack and Dax.
Oh, I threw that one up this time.
So it doesn't always come out your ear.
Wee!
The Orion Express.
Coco!
Oh, this is the mission!
Oh my god, this is the mission!
Ah!
Coco!
And what's the tiger's name?
Oh my god!
Oh my god!
Oh my god!
I know it's like first thing in the morning,
but I'm so happy!
Oh my god, this is the mission that I always
remember from childhood.
Oh my god, go Coco!
Go Coco!
You did it!
You're so beautiful!
Oh my god, it's the music!
Ah!
Get it, get it, get it, get it!
Oh my god, get it, get it, get it!
Yes!
Oh no, I hurt myself.
I didn't know what I was supposed to do there.
I forgot, but I got a checkpoint.
Oh, I jumped into it!
Coco, no!
Oh, but it's okay.
The tiger forgives me for being a terrible driver.
Oh, I did it again!
Oh shit, stop jumping!
Stop jumping!
Okay, no more jumping.
No jumpies, jumpies now.
But no jumpies.
And then big boy jumpies!
Oh, I missed!
What the heck, I was so close!
Oh, if I run ahead, I can attack.
Wee!
Rawr!
Tiger!
Ah, how can you...
Oh no!
It's so bad!
Oh my god!
Wait, what happens if I run out of lives?
Is it over?
Is it over for me?
This is over for Mesh.
Wait, can I just run ahead and hurt them?
Wee!
Rawr, there was a freaking leap in a half!
Call me Jewel Leeper,
because one tiger run is all it takes.
Wee!
Oh my god!
This is such a good machine!
Oh, my little tiger!
Soft kitty, warm kitty,
little ball of fluff.
Oh, that's the best mission
in the entire game.
Okay, we can end stream them.
That's all we needed to do.
Wee!
That's all we needed to do.
Oh!
I don't know what the diamond is.
Right, what we got next?
The Boneyard!
There are like three more of that?
Oh my god!
What?
Oh no!
Neurons activated from childhood.
Oh no!
I think I get chased
this entire mission!
Oh no!
Oh no!
There's lava everywhere!
It's jumping faster!
Oh, I don't know, I'm jumping faster!
Oh my god!
Why did you do that? Crash!
Crash, why did you do that?
Crash, jump! Crash!
Crash, you need to jump!
Like, double jump!
Whoa, wait, I can't do it!
Wait, can I just stay here forever
in the tower?
Is that a Tyrannosaurus talk or something like that?
Wait, why can I not jump that?
Can you double jump it again?
Is it...
Oh, is it that? Jump, spin?
Whoa, I could hardly get over that!
Oh no!
I can't believe it, childhood
me strikes again.
Can I not double jump?
Hold the jump!
Hold the jump?
What the heck? I'm not going to make it!
I'm going to run out of lava!
Oh no!
Wait!
Wait, it's not doing anything!
Hold on, let's practice.
Jump, jump, jump, jump!
Jump, uh!
Uh, uh, uh!
Ah!
I don't know how to double jump!
Uh, uh, uh!
Uh, uh, uh!
It's not letting me double jump!
Oh, it is letting me double jump!
Wait, but I jumped right into it!
Oh my god!
It's so over and the stream
hasn't even freaking started!
I can't figure it double jump!
Is my input wrong?
I'm holding A on my controller.
There is no double jump.
Uh, uh!
I'm getting so confused.
Is this a child's game or not?
Answer me!
Is this game for kids to complete or not?
It's not looking good.
Can't even get through the first freaking jump!
Woo!
Hey!
Dash jump is one way.
Is for kids.
I'm getting filtered by level 3.
I actually am!
I don't know how to go through this.
Level 3, I actually am!
I don't know how to do it!
I'm, like, trying to extend the jump.
But there's nothing to extend it.
It's just a straight magma jump!
Woo!
You unlock double jump after beating a boss.
Wait, so leave and then go to see a boss
and come back?
Are you holding your jump button
down instead of tapping?
If I tap, hold,
tap.
Holding, tapping.
Right, hold A.
Holding A!
Fuck!
Holding A!
This is me holding A!
Okay.
It just seems to be, like, so tiny and
slate.
Like, minuscule.
Woo!
Right, this is the furthest I've ever got.
Don't mess up now.
Okay.
I need a breather, honestly.
Right, I'm just going to keep going.
Oh my god!
Why is that so hard?
Oh, that's TNT!
Wee!
That's more TNT!
They explode!
Okay, we did it.
Oh, gee willikers, I sure hope we don't have to do
that segment again, because, uh,
what the heck? Why is that so hard?
I literally have no double jump open.
You should try jumping over them.
Taming matters.
What's this?
Oh, a platform?
I don't have access to it.
Golly, you scared me.
Oh my god, it's discord nature!
Is this...
What does that do?
Okay, well,
I remember what it does now.
Wait, can I do this?
Oh.
Go away, you're so creepy!
What are you?
Oh, bonus time, bonus time!
That's what it does.
Yeah.
Don't touch the nature.
No discord daddies.
Or no discord groomers in the velar.
Good luck.
Wow.
Bence?
Bounce?
Oh my god, I get free life.
Well, I definitely needed that after how...
Oh!
He just scooted.
Why is he so slow when he crouches though?
Okay, I like the bonus distance.
Where's the key?
Try to tap crouch
when walking to get faster.
Tap crouch while walking.
Oh, every hundred apples,
I get a life.
Ah, those things are so scary.
For a duke.
Exclamation mark.
What the heck did I just do?
Oh no, I was supposed to jump.
I missed the jump.
Oopsies, I was supposed to jump on top of them.
Oh good.
I don't like this camera angle.
No, this is why I didn't like the camera angle.
It felt like I was going to get chased again.
Okay, give me the checkpoint at least.
Oh, there's...
Gate the way up.
Oh no!
What was that?
Crash?
Did you just stand on lava and let me win?
Oh my god, the game feels so bad for me.
That is letting me win.
It feels so bad for me.
Please don't slow me down.
Oh my god, get me out of here.
Oh, get me out of here.
I'm not playing this level again.
Wampa Fruits, they're wampas.
Oh my god, the game felt so bad
it let me walk on lava.
Oh, that came up more.
Honestly, me right now.
Did I do four there?
Yes, I did. Right, we're not playing that one again.
That one was stinky. We're doing five.
We're doing...
Oh, Coco!
What's this one?
It's me.
Eh?
To accelerate, right trigger.
There's no backwards.
Oh my god, it's so wobbly, wobbly.
Whee!
Jump shot.
Wah!
Yoo-hoo!
Oh my god, this is...
Oh, there's a bomba.
Wait, wait, let me get the bomb.
Oh, 360.
That's okay. 360!
She's actually doing spins.
I'm not doing any input for her
to do those spins, by the way.
I'm just jumping on it.
Oh, there's bombas!
Bomba!
Oh no, I've only got seven lives.
Oh well, I just regained a new one.
Okay.
This is a child's game. Children can play this.
So I can play this.
I'm wise enough to play a child's game.
Surely.
Surely I won't have to run out of lives.
If I play at the same level
over and over,
Dad just gets infinite lives.
Because we might have to farm lives
unironically.
Right, hold on. What's going on here?
No. Yes.
Yes. Okay, we made it and we're going to get this checkpoint.
Wah!
Eh, excuse me.
I said we're going to get this checkpoint.
Oh my god.
It's edging me right now.
Wah!
Oh, that was close. That was close.
I was a bit too close for comfort.
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Timon's going to be fine. It's fine.
Oh, there's a seagull!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow it down. Slow it down.
Slow and steady.
When's the race?
Then you need to go 100 miles per minute.
Wah!
Honestly.
Good game.
I am going to drop into the bomb.
But I didn't because I'm so
emotional at this child's game.
Wah!
Oh, there's two bombs. That's cheeky.
The devs did that for a reason.
They knew I was going to be greedy
and go for the bomba.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hello?
Okay. Holy crap.
I was like, can I even go near that
wall?
Steady, easy, easy.
Take it easy.
Steady.
I'd say someone steady when's the race.
But sometimes, sometimes you got to
just send it and get out of here.
Oh my god.
Oh, this is so good.
Who suggested this game?
Congrats on you if you suggested it.
Just kidding. I picked it
because it's a childhood game.
Okay.
Okay.
The boss fight.
Oh, no.
Tiny Tiger.
Oh, no.
I'm not going to get perished by a boss.
Crash.
Crash.

Just keep running. Spank!
And then we do it all over again.
Okay.
Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. This is so much faster
than the second phase.
But that's okay!
Okay.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Just keep running.
Just keep running around.
He'll come to me.
We did it. We're doing it. We're doing it.

Supercharged body slam

Please! I love this so much!
Oh, that's so good.

Momay domination.
Dang straight.
Dang straight!
Well done, children.
By defeating Tiny,
you have unlocked the gate to the next time travel area.
Go back to the center of this time, Trister,
and save your progress if you wish.
From there, you will see
that the gate to the second time travel area
is now open.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay.
Okay, so I've unlocked everything in this one.
In the castle segment.
How do I save the game?
Left trigger, save.
Uh, sure.
Oh, auto-save is already active.
That's fine.
Yeah, just save that though.
Yeah, okay.
Just in case.
What is this?
So we've got Arabia,
China,
Egypt,
the future,
South Korea then,
for the future.
Are you squidding me right now?
Tiny, Spiny!
I would just like to formally say that I,
Tiny, Spiny, am not associated with
Tiny, Tiny in any way,
and do not endorse his actions.
No.
Way to go with the game so far.
It's going so good.
I love it.
Thank you for the five gifted memberships.
Congrats to those who caught it with your face.
It means you get access to the moots.
I'm going to very quickly grab a can of cola.
I'll be literally in those seconds
because I couldn't finish my tea,
so I'll just get cola.
Surely we can't be no weak to me at all.
Sure.
My question,
briefly,
is surely not all commissions are that short
because there's only five locations.
And if there's only five locations,
I don't...
I think they were going to be finished with Game in two hours
and redirect him into Sheevie
because there's no way.
Thank you for the gifted membership
for Jinger, and thank you for
the tip, Tiny, Spiny,
if.
They're short, but you'll die a lot.
What happens if I get zero lives?
Like, I genuinely lose?
This is called
G-Wiz
and...
It deletes your save file?
Am I being trolled right now?
Or did I genuinely lose all progress?
Because this is an old game
and that's exactly what old games did.
They make you lose your...
Whoa.
Go back to the farm!
Go back to the farm!
Back to the farm!
Back to the farm!
Oh!
Barely float!
Ah!
Okay.
Oh!
Ah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
The way I absolutely
decimated that poor man.
It's not that old.
You just lose your score and start from your latest level.
Oh!
A game over. The player is given the option to either restart the game
from the beginning of the level.
kind of with the standard number of lives for or to quit to the title screen okay so I don't lose
all my progress that's good because if I lost all my progress we're actually going to play a game
called conquers bad fur day but conquers bad fur day is so old that you oh my god I like got a
trick shot there and it's so old that you lose your progress if you mess up and so I'm gonna try
and win conquers bad fur day but I actually have terrible news I don't know if I can win it go back

anyone I said two things to me when I played the game mode for the first time hold on crash
bandicoot warped um what is this motorcycle controls xbox I'll put xbox because I'm using xbox
controller hold down the x button to accelerate and square to break I said xbox controls we don't
have a square so it's literally breaking go
it's literally just breaking go and that's it what is it so
to is a accelerate
I guess a is accelerate right and then I just need to focus on not oh my
oh and you don't we don't even have an option to reset I don't know if I'd be faster to reset
and then go again brah literally get out my way honestly can the game tell that I'm
a struggling child and then the AI will lower you know how some of those games have like reflective
and they're like oh my god you're struggling we're just gonna lower the game
difficulty for you can I have that please I'm literally struggling so hard
right stop drifting crash it's it's causing a lot of issues it's causing a lot of issues
I'm not even gonna pretend otherwise can you stop oh right right right right right right right
right I get it I get it crash crash oh oh I'm actually gonna have a word with you once the stream
is over oh my god can I really not progress wait I'm gonna back out and see if I can just skip to
the next level because oh my yeah and there's so many police on the road and they're not even
doing their job you're not even a civil servant you're not even serving the public at all just
hanging about on route 66 for any reason honestly they wonder like folk call themselves a sovereign
citizen you're doing shit no again please oh my god

thing because this is impossible they wonder Coco's right no don't restart level give me a
break let me come back to it let me come back to it because I don't know what I'm supposed to do
I don't know how I'm supposed to do it right we're not doing road crash more like right

this game but I'm feeling it Mr. Krabs oh okay I was just gonna belly flop
well that wasn't worth it
swing swing and then get past okay we're doing it we're doing it it's fine it's fine
so if I do this no let's not
I don't really want to set it all
I thought I had enough distance to do that okay I won't do that again I'll leave the TNT as is

oh this isn't gonna go well reeflings
yeah this is gonna turn into an endurance stream at this rate
okay okay on the green one two now we've got a boost good to go get out my way
and then just take it easy as long as crash doesn't start like violently sliding on the tracks
it's yeah see when you do that crash when you do that crash it becomes very hard to control
what I'm trying to do so don't do that again crash and maybe just maybe
yeah okay that's fine haven't really done anything that's messed us up too dramatically

well you've crashed a few parties before but I never expected you to make
it this far if you don't turn back
wow okay okay I can do this I can do and these get these kind of maps are
Molotov cocktails I'm sorry but there's something about the Geneva convention
oh my god a magic carpet right oh

Amy figure when go wait Amy a figurine you'll have to like and subscribe a bit
more for a figurine the thing when oh right okay sorry I'm getting distracted
and if you guys are like serious but like oh when can we get this particular
merch that particular merch the sad thing is and I have to message these
companies and then I basically have to go here's the statistics and here's oh I
almost perished there and it's like I can't go to a company to produce like
merchandise it's like a lot of money and and sorry let me try hard
so one okay that's fine that's fine we got that we got the checkpoint and and I
basically I can't ask for like this merchandise that costs like thousands to
be produced if it's like yeah we've got 4,000 subscribers like it's just not
happening and so you know if you ever want to support your girls just make
some clips of them go viral or something I don't know okay holy crap
whoa this is a risky map I'm not gonna lie this is one more oh bonus map bonus
time um they need a minimum guaranteed return on investment yes like
Ubu market and we're absolutely fantastic because to get and to get I
completely forgot I can double jump half the time
oh there we go and I'm not I don't want to accidentally fall off the map to be
honest I'm quite happy just to move on and yeah like you need to go to the
company and be like this is what we do and this is why we're a good fit for
you here the statistics to back up like and you know such and oh and oh right
you go wait what's that death do I want to go on that one I did just hit a
checkpoint oh no oh no I just I looked an achievement for them get viral get
viral get viral yes and like as I said Ubu market were fantastic because they
gave three designs like they made three designs for the girls and it was like
the girls aren't even out we had absolutely no idea what the estimations
were looking like or the success or whatever and we were my name wonder
they call it the death route right I'm not doing that again I don't think it's
imperative to the plot oh yeah no I'm not fussed for the death row we why he's
got random TNT you got a name but yeah they were like yeah you can have three
designs which was fantastic and if oh oh wait I don't want to touch that cuz it's
TNT I guys just throwing swords over there hey check point right hold on
jump belly float oh wait let's see there so it doesn't blow oh go away you're so
creepy oh yeah is this are you sugar that hurt me
it's okay um
oh I don't like the look at that oh I'm not even in range of it oh my god his
mouth like being wide open while she's climbing oh thank god give me off this
map you have to complete them to get the best ending isn't there not only one
ending where you win this crash bandicoot the game was like that but I've
vomit up there was this enemy Dr. Entropy isn't Entropy when you're
like skinny I'm I think it's not in our way too stupid to understand what you're
getting yourself into this time you've done it
Entropy there's usually a special hundred percent completion and then jump what
does that mean what does that mean what does it mean I don't know
oh
oh take that you you you scallywag ah okay okay okay whoa oh my god the music
oh I actually really like that the boss fights aren't that hard like I said
it I'm sorry I said it sorry if this is gonna age terribly and I'm gonna like
struggle with the next boss fight but I think this is lovely like this is this
is a lovely experience I spoke far too soon I apologize for my ignorance I do I
spoke far too soon I admit it I confess to my sin right let's try that again
okay let's try that again I never made it this far into the game as a child I
don't think I did either because I am I don't recall anything past Coco I just
think that only remember Coco okay okay okay right this time don't let the
missile go to my head so that'd be great okay wow I almost jumped into that
honestly him laughing is so me like if I was an evil person
oh take this
oh to spin longer and faster or to glide while in the air press X repeatedly
wow I love that move first try yeah yeah first try first try first try
you must realize that this time twister machine is very delicate without Dr.
entropy's constant care and control and she's trying to what it will do and she's
trying to guilt truck was into losing who knows what it'll do oh no right we're
back to being a lady because we did the general mission okay we're going to Egypt
to a rabie and now the sphinxinator I want to explore your sphinxinator oh my
god is this is going to the left side of the map now from that previous map no
it's not it's just me making stuff up I'm sorry second gen sphinxinator confirmed
honestly I'm sorry it's not whoa a sarcophagus
and not the good king Blake Azura whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa who o
okay that was terrible tabin can we get like a crossbow maybe okay let's try
that again I don't know when I was supposed to jump for him angle ah maybe
Maybe I was supposed to double jump over the flames, right?
You, and then a mummy, okay, that's fine, return the slime, watching you play this makes me
want to get a spiral, I've never played spiral but people were recommending it and I was like
I might give it a shot, give me checkpoint please but let the doors close first because I was 100%
gonna fall for that, hold on, I want the spikes up, okay, all right I'm safe to go on it for the
section which is fine, that sarcophagus is making some, you're scaring me, I like how it
pings off onto like some of the items to break them for you, oh god I'm so bad at this one,
double jump, okay, we need to wait, spiral is also fun, yeah spiral and crash bandicoot can I get,
are they by like the same developers or was it just they happened to come out
kind of closely the same time, right what did I do wrong here again, I had nothing to protect me,
I'm wondering if I have more time if I do that, oh wow I do, right,
and let me guess that doesn't explode the T, oh no it does, I was gonna be like oh let me guess it
doesn't do anything, again, oh no, oh we're struggling with this one,
goodness gravy, am I making this look easy, no sorry am I making this look hard,
right and then wait for it to come back and then jump on it and then defeat the mummy twice
or the sarcophagi, jeez, let's try this again, right and then I can just double jump here
because I'm out of range and then he's gonna drop that which explodes that one first just fine with
me, right don't send it, don't send it reflings, if you ever replay this game don't send it at
that section because that's what I thought I had to do there and it did not pay off, I need to wait
until he spawns the second blow, we'll get there it just takes me a few moments, can't believe it
they made me flat, the lollipop model confirmed first Ronnie, right again just jump over this
which is fine, oh there's not even TNT this time the game said yeah you're struggling, right send it
send it send it send it right and you would work if I sent it, oh I've got a checkpoint goodness
that'll be very welcomed I assure you, there's really enemies behind this, yeah there's freaking
TNT, oh take your time, take your time, there will be a mummy, okay we're good, we're good, we're
doing it, we're doing it, we are doing it, oh why would they randomly have a natural there
oh oh send it send it send it send it, I like how he just looks at me as if I'm not about to
kablamo him, uh this seems suspiciously easy, rather this is suspiciously, oh wait hold on, oh
crystal let's go on the bonus map, don't send it no idea I'm literally giving you the strats live
because uh I'm struggling, okay there's lots of TNT, I'll just let it pop and then run away again
what oh there's too many oh dear
there's lots of freaking
oh well that's the best I can do, the best I can do is what I've got,
cuckoos don't look at the explosion because she's so cool, I start off a guy, oh I'm just a
bit rude of me but uh I did the job, oh there's like monkeys in these pots, sling your shit elsewhere
oh my god he's quaking, his little ankles are gone, he's quaking in his boots
oh I've got another life, thank you, okay, perish, perish, yeah yeah yeah, start quaking more, boom
I don't know what that does, I think you're supposed to like go back when you do that but
I don't go back, there's a message in the discord, I need to be worried
no everything's fine, okay 17, bye bye blimp, I'm in the sky, oh my god we're playing crimson skies

timing on the ramp, we still did it, oh right we're safe, we're safe, man this freaking game is
just like so unapologetically good, like yeah suck at the racing ones but that's fine, sorry Mr. Seagull
I got pecked to death, oh my gosh, anyway uh as I was saying before I got pecked to death by a
freaking seagull, um this game is like so unapologetically good, like it's such a chaotic
fun experience, it's so good, I didn't know the seagulls could hurt me like that,
I mean is he even there, he's not even here this time, so he didn't really care that much about the boxes,
baby
I'm just like the music, it's so, whoa, that one that's rude, don't do that again, you upset me,
that's just like such a freaking good game experience, honestly, am I gonna land on that bomb, no,

way, you're a cuttlefish after all, I'll, I'll cuttle your fish in a minute if you don't, I don't know,
please leave me alone Mr. Shark, I think I'll just do this checkpoint, yeah let's do the checkpoint

it was like bear the first time you played this map, the bombs were moving, there's like enemies
everywhere, I mean I know games are supposed to, please leave me alone Mr. Seagull,
nope, nope, that bomb is teasing, that bomb is teasing and teasing me,

know why I did that but we'll do it, oh my god, so good, oh this, I'm so surprised how much I'm
enjoying this, but then at the same time I'll always enjoy kids games like literally Viva

frenzy, oh we're going to the city of Calun, although they wrecked it,
wow there's laser beam timing, I miss Viva Fina, bro everyone is waiting for Viva Fina 3 to be

it up, oh my god that was the first checkpoint was like so long into this, um on the flyer and
saucer you guys I hate them too, people are waiting for a review with me at a stream to be
announced and I agree, I would want some sort of remaster or get the same dev team in because
we were so precious, go away, oh sugar, let's try that again, go away, wow what, yeah that's
exactly what I thought was gonna happen Coco and I was forced to do that stinky game, that guy's red
and go green, I think, go away, oh
oh I'm to fly, oh right, oh sorry I thought that was gonna explode, wait we'll do the bonus level
I thought that was gonna explode the moment I came near it, okay we're safe, oh no the game's
telling me to like double triple quadruple jumps and stuff, wait well double jump and then
okay we're fine, we're fine, kendo
okay and we got an extra life, double jump, right we're not doing bonus levels anymore

Vajingo for the five gifted members, shit, and congrats to those who caught it, enjoy the emotes
I have four 10 emotes up for it, wait
I'll just cross, I have um
10 emotes, the girls are getting their batch of 10 before me because the emotes artist
is gonna take a month to do them and I'm crying internally when she told me that because
ouch why a month, it hurts, and they increased the price as well, it sucks even more
because I like when emotes all look the same, like where it's clearly, what the heck am I supposed to do
oh wait was that on note to spam eh?

right double jump, oh sorry I'm like throwing all these apples away, right not apples
so fly and then x, no right that didn't work, so fly up and then, no why
sorry I need to practice doing it this way but it's actually not doing it that way

okay okay I know not to go now right spikes and jump on his doodoo hair and then jump on that
and then destroy everything and we did it okay jeez that was terrible that was a rough one
the game giving me a free mask because I'm so bad you get the petty mask no
that's terrible but I got the crystal that's the main thing
18 I did that one 19 I just did so 20 oh my god we're getting there
tomb waiter more like womb raider am I right

reges at all getting bounced back and forth a staring contest with a freaking game honestly
I believe the science assistants are robots oh my god we're getting the secret hidden lore that I
don't know about whoa what was that up there I saw that don't think I didn't see that exactly what did
I just do wow is it this I just unlocked I think I probably just did that yeah ain't no way I'm
jumping over those nitros they're gonna explode whoa I'm not even bothering to attack him
oh can I make it in time please don't crush me okay I made it I made it oh there's 10 TNT ahead
honestly I did I thought this game was gonna take eight hours but it must be eight hours if you're
100% it and like go back and do everything um
but yeah I think we're probably gonna be redirecting to any of this right if I'm blasting through the
game like this it honestly would do me quite well because I need to go upload the girls ASMR
for them still whoa that her beetle just got absolutely annihilated bonk
yes mersey and aces meme ASMR I'd be told I'm gonna push I'm gonna publish so hopefully they
do quite well right oh let's go cool cool you're doing amazing right we are going against doctor

I will safely get past bro cocoa that was so violent honestly she's done asking nicely she's
had enough she's like bro get me out this game and then do what do this and then oh no I'm broke
oh my god I didn't really had a rocket launcher and crash bandicoot I definitely did not get this
far into the game as a child as a wean as a speckle honestly I was probably a molecule
when I was playing this I'm just a bastard bandicoot with a rocket launcher I thought of that mean
but there is like nah there's no way I can bring it up I'll have to let everyone bring it up because
hold on nah I can like aim to the sides like this thank you lord of stroms for the five gifted
membership congrats to those who caught it with your face you'll have to enable membership gifting

or coco can't bandicoot because coco hog
wow I almost got done congrats on those who caught the the members
oh wow see it worked that time but every other time I try to do the fluffy effect and fly it never
works she didn't manage to do another two games I have never actually played the other two games
so I don't know what the experience is like oh sorry I didn't mean to like get rid of all those
oh my god the game's like so kind it doesn't even go against your like
ammo can I like shoot you no no okay I have to do the dodge
I'm freaking loving this game oh my gosh it's like so well put together other than the recent ones
but because I'm dumb and couldn't figure out
thank you for coming on member and lord of strums again for the gifted membership me and the reeflings
just as I was complaining about a race in the mission
it's the last one though
it's the last race in mission surely
surely two and then go right I got the boost
the police are doing nothing other oh I never even saw that oh my god I need my glasses on so badly
we'd just still love me as a streamer if I never put my
I'm trying to hold it together I'm trying to hold it together I'm at the absurdity that is these maps
for racing I'm literally seventh place there's no way
I there's no way I've got this I refuse yeah get in my way Yabu
okay everyone's using the ramp which is fine I'll use it too okay you're gonna have to use
the ramp because of the bro these AI police cars bro you can't even reverse in this game
the reeflings I'm gonna have to send my game file to one of you right now
and then you send me it back complete and I'll do the other missions while I'm at it
because this is ridiculous uh why did they make the freaking driving one so hard
and crash if you didn't stop skating everywhere across the map we're actually gonna have issues
out my road okay well that was terrible please don't ever do that again
I'm fifth place oh and I missed it
okay the AI can actually go off road which is interesting I didn't know that
the AI is adapting and I'm getting nervous why are they oh and I missed it again
I'm fourth place honestly that wasn't awful I'm wondering right we'll keep doing it we'll
keep doing it we'll keep doing it that was the first time I played the map and the first thing
I did was fall off okay reeflings are always thrilled to princess carry me honestly I just wish
I just I just I'm getting filtered by a child game three two and then hold boost okay and then
on the left side there is already an issue so the AI is actually choosing to go off the map
which is curious I didn't think the AI did such a thing
very curious indeed yeah they're all avoid in the polis
so just take it easy these corners didn't do so yeah I didn't do so hot in these corners
wow I'll take that boost though I'll take that boost thank you
I have to take this ramp because there is a gap you will not make it
go minasori you will not make it if you take that gap it's okay no fender bender fender bender
that's illegal you have to stop and call the police oh fuck this
okay hold on can you fender bender elsewhere please elsewhere okay
okay
I'm trying reeflings I'm actually trying so hard right now I'm sweating my my cheeks off
I say I'm sweating my panties off but you all know what's happening with that oh I might do it
oh my god I might do it oh my god just don't just don't
my mouth is the gate from how hard I'm trying right now
oh oh my god I did it in two oh thank god thank god oh my god that was so freaking hard
literally maximum mouth breathing all all wrinkly parts of my brain were locked in
all the smooth parts of my brain were told to be quiet momentarily oh my goodness gravy thank god
I never have to do a racing mission again victory victory oh lol oh such a good game
I'm sorry I'm absolutely loving this I highly recommend it reeflings if you have
got some money to spare right now and you want to give a gamers hey I was on top of your heat

I have to wait until the nice man goes away and then I don't come back
right flamethrower which is fine oh the guy's gone now see the game helps you if you're rubbish as
well which is even better the game is holding my hand oh my god I can't believe a reefling made
this game just for me because they knew how much I struggle oh my god reeflings you're actually so
selfless it's stunning like you're so polite right we've got a checkpoint what's going on here
okay I made it anyway I don't know what's going on but I made it anyway there's a little thing to
the right I'm tempted to go explore but you know what we'll go explore to the right what's over here
don't think I didn't see that
I thought it was a hidden thing to the right you're and it's not you're telling me it's not a hidden
area to the right bro I'm sorry but reeflings are pranking me I can't believe you got in the
dev team just to prank me bro whoa you see there I want to interact with none of that I want none

hit by them okay that's pretty good to know man this one was so far away

previous knowledge other than that first dinosaur like I was having a stroke trying to figure out
how to get the dinosaur to not coblame on me
um yeah I've got like a little guide for the girls that like has a list of the games that
they can play and like on based on complexity but I actually need to make it a much better list

cute story about how gen 2 is going to be produced with me and the wreathlings um i honestly don't

have the girls heard of the tinfoil rant rants if so what's the reaction oh i'm too embarrassed to
tell them um i'm too embarrassed to like tell them how much i like despise debt and credit cards and
how like the economy is rigged against them especially because like um they may or may not
live in america which makes it even like everything is against them like she be told this story about
her crashing a car and then she jumped off a cliff or something i'm like yeah i'm too embarrassed to
tell the girls that part i just say to them like oh you're doing great um uh i just need this a some
more script from you i'll edit the rest you guys just have fun it's too late for me it's over two
weeks and i hear your voice in my head all the time have i successfully mind broken you do your
wreathling why do you act like you don't want to let it happen let me see into every part of you
until it's all me
glad i could mind break you though i've not even done that part of the hypnosis yet
i mean we ain't even done the tear list yet where i explain in detail every scenario i want to do to you
because of that tag
hydration check
strongy you make me fragile when you talk like that that's why i do it
they're gonna be a little me mark and be all happy and stuff but i do like the juxtaposition
as well as many other positions hold on a minute thank you
here all week dear mommy oh i did beat that one
oh wow someone's analizing my ovulation cycle so a normal ovulation cycle lasts about 24 hours
each month this is correct once an egg is released from an ovary it will dissolve within 12 to 24 hours
if it's not fertilized and the window is about a week before ovulation since it survives for
almost a week so basically if i was trying to fertilize you i would need to do it the day before
for optimum success chance which means the 13th of the month i'll refling you went gen 2 already
you missed your window of opportunity you're gonna have to try again next month with me huh
and we'll just keep trying and trying and trying
uh okay we did it
hi strawney hi replaying just wanted to say that i appreciate your content so far
well i absolutely continue support oh thank you i'm glad i'm glad uh i'm a bit nervous
sending you my first marshmallow oh don't worry i don't bite hard uh but i'll be sure to send you
some more stuff in the future quick question any advice for aspiring script writers make sure to
smash that like button and subscribe to my marshmallow account for more content what what does
that mean um any advice for aspiring script writers consume content and then do what you like
the easiest way for things to naturally occur and now then again i am i have a raging uh
tism over things which helps me like just absolutely work out the wazoo um whenever i'm
presented with a new special interest uh that i'm being educated about i will consume multiple
videos of that content i will i'll put them in times too so i can uh understand the language
that's being used the scenario or situation um and then i just say i like this part but i didn't
like this part i will do this and i will do that and make it my own that's basically how i
attempt scripts it's not that it's not like saying honestly the behind the scenes is rather boring
hmm do risky things happen on membership stream i don't know we're doing a tag rating stream
uh for my first stream i've never done a watch along um i think we're actually watching transformers
the first transformers were sam witt wookie sam congrats if you name sam by the way but
his name is sam witt wicky his marshmallow cherry yank my cherry now
we flings have six tentacles you have eight you have eight arms but you make a little
lot of love heart uh with your front tentacles because we love each other and you got your
little nicotine patch with actual cannibal shy and the buff the o7 movie yeah like it's like
was she a love of shy a love of sorry she uh she and love um did you enjoy the philian fanfic
i don't know where the location of that was
you know stroney my phone broke recently and all it did was glow green and start moving up
and down kind of like when you start glowing it reminds me of you your phone broke i'm literally
hacking into your technology right now so you become even more obsessed it's working the nicotine
patch subdues you for a little bit but unfortunately i get a bit too intense which is why i need to
subdue you editing a silly burp compilation of one of the girls what do you think uh yeah i don't
see why not i'm not being funny someone said that uh she be let out a toot i didn't i'm gonna
freaking message she be after the stream and be like can i clip your toot because whenever
uh a toot gets clipped um all of a sudden um it's like super funny and ha ha and all of that
and so literally the start of the short is gonna be like brian tts being like vtuber accidentally
farts on stream and and play the clip and then oh oh 100 000 views please please give she be a
cabillion subscribers yeah need to go ask the girls literally i need to go put in the discord
if any of you have farted uh please let me know so i can clip it if you're comfortable let's be
clipping it oh my god edit my gen mates part oh what a weird timeline we live in my ancestors
were peasants working in the fields if only they knew that the one who surpassed like the bloodline
ends up editing a toot do you think my ancestors would laugh at that or they'd just be like what
is going on over there they're like no i can't handle this oh the archive of our own link no i
didn't read it yeah i got a bit nervous because i don't know what archive of our own is i think it's
just for text and stuff um i'm sorry mummy but when you rage at games i think of you
are wording me with that passion a wreath playing i don't think we're allowed to say that out loud
but that's hot that's amazing have you ever played metal gear before i haven't um is it easy
if it's easy i'll play it is there a story mode for gamers like me
he's just the one that's saying it out loud wait post that meme where it's the guy like standing up
hold on wait standing up meme guy uh he's like standing up in a courtroom oh my god i've got it
hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on wait let me make the meme let me make the meme no one
say a thing or i'm gonna forget how to make the meme okay i've got the jpeg and then i need to open
up an ms pane hold on let me open up the picture in ms pane no one say a thing okay let me cook
let me cook let me cook let me cook this is so bad this is terrible
reeflings you're such a naughty influence on me
okay it's not gonna work i mean i think it's gonna work yeah okay it's working
you can tell of me there's an ms pane oh my god hold on right you ready for this are you ready
oh yeah lost it oh no it's like we're down here this is literally
oh no a thing a thing thank you for the tip slice saver
reefling you're standing up against the masses you're so brave for saying that part out loud
that's so terrible i hope no other beach ever comes in stream and sees that oh my god that's
terrible why are we like this together we bring out the worst side in each other like the the
degenerate side in each other honestly um are you gonna take the but it's a little test again
yeah i'll take it um we can 100% do that stuff i have no problem with that stuff
whereas you mean best he speaks the truth and they hated him for he spoke the truth i can't
i'm not gonna add it into that jesus meme uh hi stroney i want you to bite me all over and leave
marks all over me including on my tentacle i wouldn't do it hard okay i wouldn't do it hard
i would do it to a degree okay i'm all caught up with marshmallows so i'm just gonna be staring
at you now chat what are you gonna do about it huh what are you gonna do sorry i'm burping away over
here we're a match made in something probably not heaven because we can't make it into heaven
with this stuff that we go on about we can't make it into heaven oh no stare back
i feel like i could uh i'm terrible at blinking contests i remember everyone in the playground
was like oh i do do stare contest and i would always lose because i suck i'm already in heaven
no need to go elsewhere will the member streams be archived i may not be able to tune in i'm not
gonna try and get them banned no i think we'll be okay we're gonna use our euphemisms where i go
tentacle and ink and i want to ink on the tentacle because we're cuttlefish out here we're cephalopods
but together we're a cephalopog because we're so cool like that yeah pogger
um have i ever heard about the gates by asa rock i'm so sorry i've never heard of that in my
life we're all stuck in perigatory keep that in mind because there may or may not be a collab
with a va and all villa members that is related to purgatory so keep that in mind
funny you brought a funny you brought that up yeah um imagine pieta but it's the virgin marie
given jesus whoa we we can't be saying that stuff out loud those are inside thoughts
so oh sounds interesting yeah you better be excited
i like when strony spoils i try my best i do i the dust is definitely settling on my list of
stuff to do like a lot of things are becoming a lot easier um and it's getting to the point where i
can fully be strummer yes i can be strummer um i i wouldn't mind having a clip manager but sadly um
i don't have anyone um i trust to be in that position um because clip manager needs access
to the girls accounts to see what people have been clipping and it ain't gonna happen so
unfortunately i am still clip manager at this point in time but it's not too bad because literally
i just take a clip and then i send it to editor then editor comes back and then i upload it on
girls channel and it's all hunky dory stop problem strummer i like when strony you didn't finish your
sentence mommy protecting her doors yes um i will be your shield i know not a lot you play
Overwatch i used to play it quite a lot sadly i fell out of love with it um when Overwatch 2 came
out but uh there is a girl called Brigitte Lentol and her slogan is i will be your shield and yes
i am Brigitte for my gen mates because i don't want anything happening to them um so i'm the i
am both the owl and the shield i love when strony does anything yes uh tomorrow's stream
i'm gonna see if i can get my heart rate monitor working um so i should be able to do that and
then you can see my heart rate during buckshot roulette i didn't manage to watch any more
cultural content because i literally i finished stream i did i see an me's memberships and then
then what would i do i don't know um and then i went on twitter i think i liked one thing and
then passed out and then i woke up like 45 minutes before stream i probably needed a big
sleep like that like it was coming it was coming that i needed a sleep like that
strony that was the whole scene wait what was the scene that's the whole scene
i also like when strony i do like when strony but why are clips private i don't know youtube
doesn't let people see what people have clipped on uh livestream or any content really if it was
public then i could get a clip master but i can't get a clip master because they're not public
but hopefully youtube changes that in a couple of months because that would then negate me even
needing to be a clip master um and then i can spend even more time we're briefly wait they're not
do you remember sending marshmallows to the girls i remember completely crashing on yesterday's
stream for anyone who wasn't watching the runescape stream i hit the 11 hour mark and became
delirious i spilled all my chips on the floor when i ended stream and i just left them until
this morning to clean up eat i was gone with the wind i i don't know what happened i ate food
and i was like oh this will wake me up this will wake me up no it freaking didn't day one day we'll
hit 12 hours for old school runescape honestly um no i didn't have any issues with it playing it but
i like completely crashed the ending of the stream was so funny i just remember being like oh let me
send the girl some marshmallows and then i started typing and i don't really remember what the contents
of it were but hopefully all is good um but yeah i remember just drinking losing it basically
i crashed way before that part of stream you used up all your energy trying to win connect for
unironically oh my god you if you didn't see runescape stream quick recap in runescape you
can play connect for i was getting decimated like the reeflings were like ganging up on me just
fucking one at a time one after the other like bro i just accepted my fate i could not win at connect
one i won one because i tried so hard and burnt my brain the second one i won by accident because
a reefling couldn't see what i was doing um i was gonna absolutely destroy yeah i remember my
sleep fading and then some strange noises coming up um sounds like a fun time bro i was perishing
i don't know what happened because normally i can last 12 hours and i had an eight hour sleep
before it but my brain oh my stomach just made a noise have you heard that my brain just perished
like it had enough it was like i'm sorry i can't hold out anymore checkers oh no i'm not playing
checkers again that was the most confusing thing i couldn't even bro we were playing checkers and i
couldn't even move on the board because i didn't know what was like going on um with the dang thing
it was a redonkiller hold on i'm just gonna pin the marshmallow oh my god that's me
that sounds like that q and a i say q and a is if we don't just like that's not the q and a
length hold on a minute that's the that's what the reefling said wait a minute who are you
i need to straw any cows there we go that's a bit of q and a q and maybe boom it's not really a
q and a is that it's just you guys being lovely to me and then i go in a ramble and i see how lovely
um it is to be here straw knee leaks oh no i sent it to myself now oh no i've been discovered
i send myself all these marshmallows i fell asleep to your stream and my brother was very
much questioning what on earth you were watching when you woke up just me raging
i choked on my burrito region actually which was that makes it like 10 times funnier so
and then i'm rage hi mommy i don't know what to ask but i really love watching you oh i'm glad
you're so funny bro you're giving me an ego we all know the forbidden rule
just genuinely entertaining in more ways than when i yeah your streams always make me smile and giggle
oh you have any giggle mate please keep it up te amo hermosa much love from port arrico te amo
port arrico come to brazil no i'm not going to brazil but thank you for inviting me no thank you
for the nice uh little message how do you feel about the dragon age games particularly the upcoming
veil guard game um i've never played a dragon quest game properly sorry a dragon age game
properly uh i played the one where brother and sister and then brother like immediately well i
said for the brother or die i think uh i played it for like 30 minutes and i was like oh this ain't
for me um but there seems to be quite a lot of fans that are distraught at the reveal because
they don't like it but i thought it was just uh i think why do we hate brazil no it's a meme
where it's like oh come to brazil do a concert in brazil but brazil's really dangerous for foreigners
we don't actually hate brazil hi starney i agree with that one riff riefling when you rage i always
think of you pinning me down and having your your way with me and then not stopping even
when i finish oh my god rieflings this is good i don't think we could say any of this out loud
what if i'm here because i was hypnotized by a moment maybe the hypnosis is listening up
we should hypnotize more not yet you have to wait you have to wait soon it's overtism we're hitting
overdrive what was that stream song overdrive burning machine oh brain power that's it brain power
oh do do do do do do do
how did you decide which of the generation one one models were going to be used
where are there other people auditioning for strawney no um if you weren't there at the start
development all six models were laid out on the website under the auditions page uh i was codename
inks and it said i am a pre-selected talent but please apply to be my gen mate uh no one
could apply for strawney because i'm strawney there is only gonna be one strawney you can't you can't
get better than me okay uh welcome to the danger zone ora ora um as for who did i pick uh uh the
models for i did take into account what the girls went for but when i heard the girls voices
pretty much instantly my brain went oh okay that's gonna be enemy oh okay that's definitely
i say oh okay that's mercy oh that's our genre oh that's she be um because i got to hear them talk
in general in the introduction introduce yourself video and they gave me a good indication of
personality type and all that so if anyone wants to complain uh you you hired wrong you put someone
on the wrong shut shut don't want to hear it do you don't want to hear it uh for a siren that can't
sing you just need to ramble and yap and i'll follow you under the waves i don't actually want you to
perish it was the concept artist that gave me that lore i don't want anyone to perish
can you say shut one more time shut
and you put the girl on the right shut don't want to hear it don't want to hear it give i'll give
you gills yeah you got a good voice to listen to oh yeah i'm a rambling you to sleep oh dear
we fly let's stay to sleep and listen to my voice as i ramble you to sleep
stroney doesn't perish she just beats on you like the water helps with the things i need to do to you
okay seven days no ink help please how has it been so long i say that as if i'm not backed up but
how what do you mean help help uh this kind of help is that the help you need
uh is that what you need i don't know what help you need you didn't specify you got to specify
or i'm not gonna come up with them one hi stroney are there any talents of corpus you'd like you'd
like or veal or to collab within the future i'm humping new me plus and i'm humping v and you
because they were lovely um methos tal hq were very receptive to us as well sadly due to timing
couldn't do the watch longs but uh methos tal seemed to be kind of already leaning on the
alternative side which makes me quite comfortable with them as creators as for actual corporation
tubers uh i'm just if the person's happy with me i'm happy with them i never want to encroach
myself on someone and that's not the word at all i agree with those other two reef flings need
mummy to take all that rage out of my tentacle until it's ink to dry oh my god um mummy if one
were to eventually build up the courage for an audio debut oh my anything you would like to hear
in specific uh or should i just let the imagination go wild any time no have fun i eagerly await your
reef fling
where did you were all this time are you are you trolling me where did you were all this time
where was i for all this time it took me a year to cook veal or give me i needed to be in the
kitchen i'm no the best at it i'm level 76 right now but it takes it takes a long time um so i was
working hard or hardly working you know we love to see a reefing pelt of his courage uh i could

future oh boy yeah next week you will be indulged out the wazoo if you mean six-man indulge collabs
i am going to ask the girls if possible that we do one collab a month together of just hilarity
ensuing um i do ah what's that game um it's hard because there's not a lot of six-man games so i
think it might have to be stuff like among us or lethal company i know residency for everyone
plays it but the problem is there's six of us there were many i think there's a back rooms game
that we can play together possibly um i do want to do monthly six-man collabs but after that um
it will be like two on two collabs maybe three three collabs angry scottish drunk karaoke went
soon i was gonna do a drunk karaoke um on um i don't know when i don't know when um but i was
going to do it on a weekend so like you guys can you know work work hard and then get all the relief
on the weekend and we get steamboats and all that when the talents are sourced jackbox would be great
but just with only one pop so you don't have to stream discord yes i am open to doing that um shebe
when we were first meeting for the first time i got the girls to play a game together and we
played jackbox and we all got addicted and we're like stuck i was like because it was only supposed
to be like a one hour icebreaker so the girls could get used to like each other because like from my
pov i knew the girls like i had consumed their content i knew kind of about them who they are
how they kind of are and all that jazz um and then we ended up playing for like two hours and i'm
like oh i'm so sorry like i didn't mean to steal all the time but then like it went two hours and a
half um in poor ac's tame zone i picked a really bad tame zone so she was so tired but she was
having so much fun she didn't want to get off um which was so cute and cute and good which says
cute if you put it dictionary oh we we're gonna possibly do a dictionary there's a new jackbox
18 that's released um okay i was gonna say i'm not sure we can hmm but we had fun on jackbox
it was so mean against ac though because english isn't her first language and one of the game modes
was like asking all these really like hard questions like even english speakers can't get it i felt so
bad for her and she kept like dying in the game i felt so bad um i see no one to get off that's
definitely not true whoa did i say that's in it deep rock galactica has a more players mod
rock and stone hi stroney would you be cool with us making not selling fan articles like
dakis oh you can do unofficial merch as long as you identify as unofficial merch
fucking go wild bro we ain't stepping on your toes and you aren't stepping on ours as long as it's
unofficial merch us all you have to unofficial merch us all you have to do we don't oh we don't
everything's good to go at that point um rock and stone deep rock galactica
wholesome story time with stroney yes that is uh how we all
it had a little icebreaker together it was very kawaii me and i can't say this on youtube but

your apology refling and also the other reflings thank you for letting me do that segment just to
prove you wrong oh been a while since i heard that on stream yeah i can do it at any moment i
don't even need like oil or anything i could just do it oh um my suggestions for gen 2 okay i'll hear

belly dancer curious a fan to say alchemist girl nature loving flower girl we do love a bit of
nature out here um disciplined ex-military mercenary and a nerdy shy big worm that's quite cute cute
cute suggestion um hi strongy love you did you start v-tubing on your own or were there
that inspired you um inspired i just i saw it and i was like oh fuck it i'll get it go um
and i i'll i've i've told this story before i was very new and i could have easily been rejected
for being an outsider type thing because i do a lot of things that you're not supposed to do
you're not supposed to acknowledge that you're pilot in america but i'm pilot in america and
i acknowledged it uh you're supposed to know the terminology such as zatsu or uh tisker uh well
it's not tisker it's tascaru uh but i call it tisker um and i could have easily have been um eaten
and chewed up and spat out but the community was so loving towards me that um i kept going
basically and i came back and i'm strongy i've always been strongy i've never been any other
vtuber for legal reasons um and yeah now now it's going good it's fantastic um i did like iron mouse
because she's sick as a dog um but like keep streaming anyway uh definitely you can always
kind of lend some energy when you hear stories about like people against all odds like you
you know you got the energy to keep up and keep going type type thing um where's my time in the
robot yeah i keep saying it like tisker like a noise you make when dying what noise that make
when i die uh oh when's my time in the robot oh no i'm a mecca i pilot a mecca like mecca salt
the hit video game from xbox original
um but yeah that my that my mecca story i do a lot of things you're not supposed to do
hey i'm not supposed to say oh i'm recalibrating my tracking uh i'm putting on my my little face
emotes um yeah eh i'm not supposed to do that hold on a minute uh but yeah i do it anyway because
i'm nori get in the robot scrawny get in the mecca oh i'm gonna burp i'm so sorry please open
your mouth okay there we go swallow it good refling okay in regards to hypnosis audios are you gonna
make reinforcement audios for triggers and for audio loops for triggers and affirmations um
you're gonna have to let me start digesting producing it first before i can answer these
kind of questions um i'm staying away from the permanent stuff because it makes me a bit nervous
doing any permanent effects stuff but i already have a public release audio that will undo any
effects i may or may not do on you what did you ask me in particular reinforcement loop for triggers
for triggers um mine's double finger snaps i like it um the most but i will train you in it okay
i am bar i'm embarrassed to admit but i inked to your clapping with no hands and the party role
play oh yeah you like that it was really hot i'm glad you liked it i put a little put a little
bit of my heart into that i like that okay i'll enjoy how it came out um hi strawnee how do you
feel about male figurines being used in bibbute videos yeah you can do that um but maybe maybe
in the future you can use official veiler merch association figurines that's not something i
need a fixation oh i got five at 10 i got seven i got nine at 10 i like the transparency though
because you're just a normal person at the end of the day yeah actually can i say something
that's really disrespectful and i mean no disrespect when i say it you know those vtuber's that have
those donations where like items get thrown at the vtuber model when they get a donation and then the
vtuber goes like the the every time i consume any of that i this is very disrespectful and i don't
mean it this way it makes me cringe to think that they're in a room on their own with the iphone
tracking them and going i'm so sorry i'm like actually so sorry for me for me it's a no but
people find it entertaining which is really cute i like that people can get so entertained and so
enveloped um that it's humorous so i do apologize to anyone that i made him uh i think yeah i've seen
it too twitch integrated throwing system oh okay is that what it's called and yeah and here you are
veiler figures that well adjusted people could be normal don't think about it harder it makes the
cringe yeah i remember seeing a clip about it and i was like don't get me wrong i'm a cringe fest if
you sit through one stream of mine but i remember seeing it and i was like oh that's rough that's
rough even for me to digest but i mean absolutely no disrespect when i say that like whatever
works for you works for you some people are balls to the wall in immersion and that's fantastic
for me um i am absolutely in love that reeflings are in love with pilot in america it makes me
incredibly comfortable um like streaming and acknowledging like oh i need to only go put my
boots on uh instead of like being like i love you so much feeling like bro ain't no one here for that
well some people might be here for that but me i'm not here for that you know um
yeah it's basically just beautiful but i don't mind like the roleplay like if i had a 3d model or
i'll be roleplaying at the wazoo so i'm probably gonna be hypocritical with that statement it's
not even a statement it's just me blabbering any blabberers the heart eyes yeah i love that my
heart eyes are so different like oh my god my squiddles where'd my squiddly pupils go give me my
squiddly pupils back wait wait wait wait hold on you ready for this you ready for this oh wait no

merch for me or for the girls um a bash bite uh i'm gonna try and get as a bash bite um i'm not
even pretending otherwise um hi shawnee any plans for age of empire 3 or age of mythology
curious i would have to look at it the current game i'm investigating that i'm not familiar
with right now is baltrol and it looks pretty decent it looks um well well rounded well adjusted
game um and i just need to kind of learn what the heck are flushes and all of that we're brewing

currently doing baltrol age of empires i could look into is that that game where you can like
have a king but like a lineage of the region or something i might have seen some gameplay of it
