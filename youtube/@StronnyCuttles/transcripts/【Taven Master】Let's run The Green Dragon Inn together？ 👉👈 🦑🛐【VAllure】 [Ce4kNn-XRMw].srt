1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
so

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:26,000
so

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:53,120
Oh dear traveller, you look exhausted, you need a pint and I'll stoke the heart for you.

4
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,880
Oh dear traveller, with your weary feet and looking your eyes, why don't you come on down

5
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:09,600
to meet Tavern and together we will make the greatest tavern known to man.

6
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,640
Mummy, what is this name you are calling me for?

7
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,200
I am the Tavern Master today.

8
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:26,880
I am fucking exhausted, but with Jesus, they've got a fucking difficulty mod.

9
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,720
And bloody Tavern Master, what's going on here?

10
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:41,920
You offer other services far, fair bar made, why it depends how many gold coins you'd like to

11
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,600
part with?

12
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,960
Right, relax, it is easier to make money and disasters are much less dangerous.

13
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,360
Normal, everything is balanced, this is how the game was meant to be played.

14
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,560
Welcome to your tavern, traveller.

15
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,880
Wait, well welcome to my tavern, traveller.

16
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,640
You will be in charge of managing and growing your business.

17
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,560
Oh irish, I was trying to do, oh no, I was trying to hop it in.

18
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,920
Oh shit it is irish, wait hold on.

19
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:44,640
Master Frodo, great job, you can also rotate the camera by holding the right mouse button

20
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,760
and moving the mouse around, albeit the tavern, the tavern doesn't look like a tavern at all,

21
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,560
that's never been irish today, one wall is missing, there are no doors and no windows,

22
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,760
let's fix that, oh dear, well we can't be having that, but I'd like to build a wall,

23
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:09,360
okay I'll build a wall, very good, I've now added a door, fantastic, okay, and a window,

24
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,360
we need to let in that natural light. Someone stole our wall, you ain't the,

25
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,080
the music got our head in mid air, great job, now let's buy some tables and benches,

26
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,360
we need it for the patrons, we only have one table in our tavern right now, that will be enough,

27
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:38,640
okay I agree with that, please let us commence forth, because that is a thing, you placed this

28
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:46,800
prop on the wrong position, I'm getting in trouble for putting down a chair wrong, show lights,

29
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:54,960
one of the benches is not inside any light range, let's light a candle to fix that,

30
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:07,200
wait what, you have to put this item next to a pillar, on a pillar, great job, how many hours,

31
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:16,640
I got like five hours, oh maybe four actually, it took me to the end of the video for the

32
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,760
sleep, that means I technically got four hours, I'm feeling like a wary traveler, but that's all

33
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:27,200
right, we can still run our business, as you can see, are here, I still have my,

34
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:38,720
my, my ale, which also just happens to have honey in it, and milk, and tea, that's my ale,

35
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:52,000
only four, I got two, who's this bar wench, I am, what would my bar name be,

36
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:02,400
great job, I don't know what my name would be, oh honey mead, that would be my bar wench name,

37
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:09,920
hi there traveler, my name's honey mead, because I'm known for consuming honey,

38
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:19,360
and also that might, great job, now that we have enough seats for our guests,

39
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,280
next up would be to buy beer and serve it, all right, we go into this tab, to buy beer we should

40
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,720
go to the bar first, click on the bar to open the menu, we currently have only water to,

41
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,240
we are not serving water, to serve the beer we first have to fill the barrel, click,

42
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:52,720
max refill, close, back, now what, great job, we now have plays for people to sit, we have drinks

43
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,560

53
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:16,720
until you know I hit the 20 minute mark, ah, and then someone time stamped it and I went

67
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:13,920
and you were still able to enjoy this video in general, thank you for at least checking me out,

68
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:21,120

69
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:30,800
I'll do a little emoji if I can, of the, of the, oh, sugar, right, I'll just do the cat face, why

71
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,240
hope it's okay though, and you were still able to enjoy this video in general, thank you for at least

72
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:51,120
hearing me out, I actually did that, that's terrible, and before he's like literally listening to the

73
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,680
live stream right now, and he's like what, what are you on about, we just pulled a little prank on him,

74
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,200
what, no talking, never heard of it, um, right, I've got my cup of tea, actually I need to check

75
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:11,600
Marshmallows, um, fucking, tried to put Azir's trailer up yesterday for her doughnuts on, and I

76
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,160
think because she got a warning for eating a cookie, it's not gonna play on her live stream,

77
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,480
so what was supposed to happen is when you click on Azir's live stream,

78
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,280
it would play her little trailer, and I got a really tasteful trailer, but I think we're just

79
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,240
gonna have to upload it in general, which is fine, it's not a problem, I'll put some ad money on it,

80
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,200
um, eating a cookie is forbidden, so she was eating a cookie, but her face was cropped off on the

81
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,760
bottom, and YouTube was like, hmm, this person eating a cookie is, hmm, how do you say popcorn,

82
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,000
and we're like, no, and argued it, and they're like yeah, this is popcorn, and we're like,

83
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,840
ah, okay, we'll go kill ourselves, so like, YouTube just, I give up with even trying to,

84
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,800
like, if they get, I just give up on trying to get it removed, or anything of that nature,

85
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,960
um, Shawnee, I think you should have breakfast with Liz at the start of every stream, and drink a

86
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,680
tea, make it a habit, just 50 minutes of company nutrition, we can get really good food and eat

87
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,920
together, what the heck, that's so sweet, Traveller, sorry, I forgot how it just sound like it was

88
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,360
all this, YouTube didn't, to be fair, Azura is popcorn, her voice,

89
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,120
oh wait, why am I typing in, sorry, I meant to type in Azura Delay, and I started typing in

90
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:43,760
and I'm just gonna check, it's a dang trailer, so where, where is it, I swear to God, I'm pretty

91
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,640
sure it doesn't work, 12 hour donut phone click, nah, the trailer doesn't play,

92
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,600
see you YouTube, see you wet leaf art, but I'll upload her trailer shortly,

93
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,440
but she's eating a cookie, not popcorn, you know what, you got me there, yeah,

94
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:09,120
oh, I just realised the staff were outside waiting, oh, there's people,

95
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:19,360
oh my gosh, we like, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, wait, we need to change the name of the town,

96
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,360
I was gonna call it the dragon, the green dragon, because that's what it is in a Hobbiton,

97
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,760
the prance in Pony's Bree, mummy, they used to be a super awesome barmaid town called the green

98
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,200
dragon, it was Hobbit doing this, oh, what the heck, I'm so dumb, the start of the downfall is

99
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,840
Ronnie Wheeler getting Ronnie Gaslight in a random guy, mark it in the finger on the monkey

100
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:48,960
paw curls, because I said, because I removed no talking from the title of the video, oh that's

101
00:12:48,960 --> 00:13:02,320
terrible, honestly, mummy I'm mad, wait, why are you mad, I had a cup of plastic containers

102
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:09,200
in the freezer filled with plain and not rotten pork fillings, what, and they got, last week my

103
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,360
roommate ate the third of my cheese bags without asking, I got the smallest bag on sale for two

104
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,000
years old, holy shite bag, you're back, are you squiddling me right now, oh no, oh shit, I don't remember

105
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:32,000

108
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,360
I didn't, I like, I registered but I didn't register until the words came out my mouth,

109
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:07,200
I'm sorry, but at the same time, thank you for the super chat, um, pour a glass of your finest

110
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:13,440
ale, sorry I just said the word but, we've prepared everything, I'm so not awake right now, hold on,

111
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:21,920
let's drink the tea first, have a look, oh, got my honey bum, I'm right, you're wrong, yeah, it's

112
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:28,160
the Matilda thing, he's like, I'm right, you're wrong, I'm big, you're small, I can't remember

113
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:37,280
the rest of it, no, I have a confession to make, I have been listening to some of your ASMR from

114
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:44,240
YouTube while at work and have gone to the bathroom to thank, oh, good morning to you too,

115
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,200
Riefland, I'm glad I can help, I think your training is starting to work out real and true,

116
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:58,000
how many hours did you sleep? No, no, I am, I am, sorry, I'm rubbing my face,

117
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,480
I have in the mild exhaustion, so please, please do not be surprised when the membership stream

118
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,280
turns into a yap fest, because that's what naturally happens, I do not have my brain

119
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:16,240
powered even mustard, the thought of conjuring up a script for a collab, right, got any liquor,

120
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,000
I have beer, okay, we've prepared everything needed for the travellers to start coming in,

121
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,080
before we unpause this game, let's see how you can unlock new stuff for the paver and click

122
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:35,120
the research button, upgrades are rescheduled, oh, nope, that's not that word, upgrades are

123
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,160
researched by serving different types of guests, types of guests, what are we doing,

124
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,760
a bit of cheeky profiling here, what's going on, and you can see the cost of research on the left

125
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:56,880
side for it, for kitchen, we need to serve 25 commoners, whoa, what in the futilism is going on here,

126
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,800
right, our only option right now is to research a kitchen, so click on the button,

127
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,440
right now what, oh, I read that a little too fast, oh, read that a little too fast and get

128
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,840
sure, sure, right, number of guests per day tell you how many people will come into your

129
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,960
cavern on average every day, buy decorations and upgrade your cavern to increase that number,

130
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:29,040
decorations, okay, my final tip to you is that you watch out if there is enough space to sit,

131
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,080
if all the seats are taken, buy more tables and benches, well can I buy them like now,

132
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:43,920
I can't get, I don't know, are people going to be self-conscious if they sit at a little table

133
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:59,280
and upgrading our capacity already, shite, we're out of money, I never thought it was far ahead,

134
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:04,800
well I tried my best, we can now fit more guests because of the seats at least,

135
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:14,880
right, and then beer and water, cuminers, oh my god, and you come cuminers, I need 25 of you,

136
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:22,480
oh my god, oh, hold on a minute, we've got a little camera rotation if I really want to get that,

137
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,520
oh, what's that, is that an elf, it is, it's a nun, oh my god, a sheebie through through,

138
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:39,280
are you a ranger of some sort, oh look at that serve, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, look at this,

139
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,640

154
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:28,720
that right now, right, how racist is it to call an elf a knife ear, so one of my players plays an

155
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,200
elvish rogue and they're going to be entering a large city and I thought it would be fine,

156
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:43,600
find the people they're not the most hospitable to, I don't see an issue, racial tension,

157
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:53,840
what is going on in dnd, I thought, oh my god, wait she's not clean enough after the patrons,

166
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,440
tension, I thought in dnd you kind of hump each other a bit, you can't trust the knife

ears, they'll stab you in the back, he cut old me knife ears, I'm literally shaking right now,

183
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:03,040
actually, or, oh, I mean money, I forgot about wages, I forgot about wages, I will say I actually

184
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:10,160
really like this game already off the bat, it's so cosy and cute and uh yeah, I can see myself

185
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:19,120
getting my dick paid, you did make a little look at refills versus income, look at refills versus

186
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:29,920
income, refills income, close enough, okay, there's plenty of beer to go around though,

187
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:39,040
what's this one, it will be done before, yeah okay, yeah, drinks and then clean them, we can

188
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:47,280
raise their wages, unfortunately I can't afford for that yet, for now feudalism, tomorrow maybe

189
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:55,840
actually, 90% of new businesses fail on the first day, wait did they fail on the first year normally,

190
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,360
the first account of lemon ages, in the 12th century Egypt,

191
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,320
after your shift, I'll make you into a mess on the bar table, excuse me traveler, that's an

192
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:20,160
appropriate conduct, get out, get out, get out pointy ears, out, out me in, thank you very

193
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:26,800
lord for the super chat, capitalism 90% of gamblers, let's finish this tea,

194
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,880
not paying your employees, is that some kind of veal or tight, real and true, remainder, it's

195
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,920
contracted, that total income chart is gonna be like my savings after the donathan,

196
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,200
a cow car, you better be teasing, I'm gonna fart on your eyelashes, if the lawyer had a tavern,

197
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,240
which of the girls would be the best bartender, everyone's vote in the chat for your oh she,

198
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:58,720
now I'm gonna say something controversial, because of AC's pause she can't grip things properly,

199
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:09,600
so I'd maybe put AC on cleanup duty, like instead of like picking items up to take off tables to

200
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,680
take to the back, she would just scoop it up like in her hands like she was hugging it like a present,

201
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,720
that's how she would do it, AC I'm guard you, oh that's right you need a, you need a thingy,

202
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,760
right I would put AC right here, oh no no it has to be on the inside sorry, I'd put AC right here

203
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:35,520
because she looks menacing and scaly, and then I would, I mean Sheevy would have to serve, I think

204
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,040
Azura would be in the corner like singing as entertainment, Sheevy would be a waitress,

205
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,160
Mercy would be a chopping up the food in the back because obviously she's got the most knife

206
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:57,360
experience, Emi, would Emi, I think Emi, I would put Emi on entertainment as well, so Azura

207
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,000
is in the corner singing for those of them who don't really want any hype entertainment,

208
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
whereas I think Emi would be like a teasing bar mate that goes around and makes sure you're having

209
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,560
a good time and then ad be on the bar, I don't think that would go rather well, I don't know,

210
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,080
maybe I'm biased, I think that would work out, hold on a minute girls, I got a backup plan if

211
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:27,440
everything goes to shit, now hold on a minute, hey thank you for the super chat, I want any

212
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:34,000
trouble, Emi is just there, hi Johnny, how do you travel her? Wouldn't Azura be a nice chef?

213
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,680
I feel like Azura has so much appeal being seen though, I wouldn't want her hidden away,

214
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,520
and like Mercy would be in her element cutting up steaks and all that and being like ah that's

215
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,120
a nice chunky, oh wait that's not what she sounds like at all, oh that's a nice chunky cut of steak,

216
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,960
I'm so sorry Mercy, I'll practice your voice one do, one do,

217
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:09,600

222
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:48,480
loads of work, like there's a lot of work going on behind the scenes, Azura, oh no I can't say that,

223
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,160
maybe tomorrow I can say it, no it's not a big deal, it's a good thing but I don't want to ruin this

224
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:04,800
surprise, Johnny trying not to ruin anything for Veiler, challenge impossible, right congratulations

225
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:10,880

226
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,560
unlocking the kitchen, here's about 800 bonus, do we have enough money to, money to build it,

227
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:23,360
step one go to the shop, buy a kitchen counter shelf, plate and a crate, hire a chef, wait for

228
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:32,640
customers to order food, where do I put the kitty in though, where are you, no sorry dumbass,

229
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,800
nope that's wrong, okay this is, how or where do I put the kitchen,

230
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:55,600
obliet, wait am I being daft, or no please don't click that, I have already used up the room that

231
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:18,240
was available to me, that was just so exciting, okay I am gonna have to move the kitchen to here,

232
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,520
and I like to put people out, you can't buy new props because some props are overlapping,

233
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,400
make sure all the tiles are green on the floor, oh they don't let you like,

234
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:36,880
right how do I get rid of this then, right no, and storage, no okay good, and then

235
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,040
uh are you squidding me right now, sometimes,

236
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:56,080
how are you, wait there must have been like a better way to do this, and I'm just very small

237
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:08,080
brains, I'm not sure that's right at all, in order to upgrade this item, you know I want to move it

238
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:18,800
like here, are they gonna be able to access that, thank you the booty lord, you're on the ram ranch,

239
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:28,640
18, we're gonna research seven, wait you have to research more guests a day,

240
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:37,200
musicians a zero, oh you can do takeaway from that, oh how interesting,

241
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,280
special events, you click the event button, click plus, choose the event and click confirm it,

242
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:54,480
do we want more money, I assume if we do all of this, more plants, stairs,

243
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:02,080
and then we can have a sleepy area, and then I can take the reef ones that get to drunk up there,

244
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,840
for no particular reason at all, can't you just make a new room, oh I never even,

245
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:19,360
that didn't even occur to me, I, and what is known as dumb, very dumb actually,

246
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,120
know that you mentioned that, know that you, don't be mad at me, you're in my way,

247
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:41,680
it's a learning exactly, all right so what I should have done is remove these walls, and

248
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:47,120
just done that,

249
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:59,360
it's rather expensive, right if we just be cheeky,

250
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,240
if we just be cheeky and put down the seats that were already there,

251
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:13,760
I mean they're now sitting on grass, I'm not sure how happy they're gonna be,

252
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:22,080
100 for a freaking candlestick, excuse me, oh I didn't put that right, okay hold on,

253
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:30,080
I'm just moving it over closer, because yeah that, how about we do that, yes, I'm learning,

254
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,760
I'm learning, okay so now we have a functional kitchen, kind of, no we need to hire, I must hire

255
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:44,720
a chef, hire a chef, wait oh I can hire a new chef, the table's not lined up, I know, I saw it,

256
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:52,400
I'm just like oh no, I think someone's not gonna like that, arthritis, arthritis, Gail Reeves,

257
00:32:52,400 --> 00:33:02,800
oh my god if Keanu is the the movie we watched, speed, skill for dessert, skill for main course,

258
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:10,000
skill for soups, I need someone, oh you're the best at soups, okay soups, yes, make

259
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:18,720
focus, focus, there's a pizza on your focus, oh they're raging, they're leaving, oh they're

260
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,880
no having it, what do you mean you don't want to sit on the grass, what do you mean you don't

261
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:29,360
want to come in, where's the roof, there's no roof, we're just at the one, okay no, so they

262
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:37,520
don't mind sitting on the grass, no they don't seem to bother, that's fine, although I assume the

263
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,160
further the tables the longer people are gonna complain because she needs to like get their orders

264
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:54,880
and go back and then go moo moo moo, or nor, it's keanu, our moony, our symmetry, is that really,

265
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:05,200
I think once we get more moola, I'll like make the tables closer as a chef, I'm just checking

266
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:18,640
this works, I need to, I need to like, what, total what, buy, higher adventurers to get ingredients,

267
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:31,840
right, so we do have stuff in store to make moola, there are orders, no refilling, we're not

268
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:37,200
starting that, you goofy giver, does the chef need something to cook good with, that's what I thought

269
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,320
but it seems like he just prepares it, has me thinking my boba,

270
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:53,600
okay, so what do we need, we need candle lights to spruce the place up a bit so it lights the

271
00:34:53,600 --> 00:35:01,760
press and apparently disasters can happen which make, okay that's much better, oh wait no we got

272
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:09,440
800 from the down thing, total seats, average capacity, average action, serving drinks,

273
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,240
taking the order, preparing the food, serving the food, I only like just started anyway,

274
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:23,680
right okay let's, I mean we already expanded our welcome to the green dragon in with one window,

275
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,720
that's all you're getting and no more, you don't deserve natural sunlight,

276
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:38,320
someone said stop, adventuring reeflings we must gather for a moment, yeah apparently I need

277
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:47,760
to send you a way to get stuff, okay so he grabs it from a chest, okay but he still seems to have,

278
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:55,120
like the beer's still full as well, we did that eons ago, it looks like water never runs out,

279
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:06,480
like at all, but the beer does, the beer does, okay he's, oh no he can clip through this which

280
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:15,360
it makes him speed running, um do we need to hire, what do we do, we got lemonade so we'll do

281
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:26,880
guess because that gives us more money and then lemonade, and then refill it, oh no I don't have

282
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:33,440
enough money to refill the food, okay every time I make money I'm just gonna hit max refill until

283
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:42,560
it's full, if they can't see the sunrise they wouldn't want to leave, oh my gosh wait that

284
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:48,720
must be a tactic, that has to be, oh well the missus isn't waiting for me to come back because

285
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:55,520
I can't see the sunlight, I don't need to touch grass as long as I can touch mommy, oh wait I'm

286
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:11,440
not supposed to say it, I'm sorry, but yes Mercy, Emi and AC have had older, why does it keep making

287
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:21,920
that noise, oh because, oh if it, oh because it's based on number of guests served, I'm wondering if

288
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:32,320
with like, I just want to make sure we're quite stocked up because I'm gonna be jump-scared when

289
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:40,640
we're not, mommy's serving, why touch grass to go anywhere when mommy is there, yeah okay so

290
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:50,560
refills cost those purchases, that's fine, that's fine, oh no why are you sad,

291
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:54,720
point,

292
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,240
wait but were you were sad because you could level up, that's interesting so you can like

293
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,720
level up a character, make sure the wheat is not flaked honestly,

294
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,600
this is a cute game honestly, I can see myself like playing this offline,

295
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:30,160
oh my god, it's a, it's runescape, the wizards outside of Iraq that always killed me when I was a

296
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,200
freaking baby, I heard it is the best thing one will ever taste,

297
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,760
no wait I'm replaying that because I spoke over it like a dumbass, are you squidding me right now,

298
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:50,000
hey barmaid, do you have some of that scrawny fish soup here, I heard it is the best thing one will

299
00:38:50,560 --> 00:39:00,880
ever taste, oh it's very, it's very um oishi I've heard, very oishi, yes, yes thank you weary traveler

300
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,880
for your interest in scrawny bro, I assure you you will not be disappointed by the flavour, you see

301
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,720
it's made with very secret ingredients that cannot be replicated anywhere else,

302
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:13,840
yeah,

303
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,760
what do they do, oh he gets them, are they base, are they modelled after Skyrim, no dumbass,

304
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:30,560
that's just actually how old stuff used to look, quite murky and tangy, I think I'll just have

305
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,800
a water, put gross hair on your chest, gross fur on your knees, potent, actually really potent,

306
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:43,520
hold on a minute, savoury, full of umami, like most sifa dishes I assure you, I wonder if mommy

307
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:52,560
has a secret menu, wait are they crying, she's like oh I'm so sad, people starting to get raging,

308
00:39:52,560 --> 00:40:02,640
oh my god I'm in trouble, it's made from scrawny berries, I'm just thinking I like cook myself

309
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:10,560
in the bath basically and I'm like well are they gonna love this, or to be umami, right,

310
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:21,440
tall seat 16, customers serve 32, so don't need my seat, angry customers, no one, so I don't need

311
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,960
a new waitress yet, it's when I need a new waitress, that's when I have to start worrying, right,

312
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:36,320
max refill the beer, max lemonade, and then, oh sugar, okay well maybe I shouldn't have done that,

313
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:47,920
right um, um um um, I guess on the research if we do take away we get more mula, can't be

314
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:58,800
fast forward, that's toxic, right start, I did take away, I feel like Uber Eats in Middle

315
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,960
Earth is like the most money you can make on something, because I like the system though,

316
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:12,080
like even though it's all different tables you can do a thing, oh god she's speeding,

317
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,440
I know I've got it on time, but she is speeding around that, look at her go,

318
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,400
I don't care if it's toxic, I'm drinking it anyway,

319
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,960
this is like simulation run, okay, a wee bit honestly, I think it's cute, I think this is a

320
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,800
very cute game, I mean come on what other tavern would allow, be half on the grass and half on the

321
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:50,560
wood, you know, it's one of them, I mean no, no, no, I must refrain from my fantasy racism,

322
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,880
which I got to learn about today, mother could we please get floors, sure how on earth I get

323
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:05,200
floors, upper floor takes with floors, oh it's free, oh I just, I was just making them sit on

324
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:14,880
grass in general, sorry that was my bad, fantasy, literally that was so that was hilarious, like

325
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,720
just I didn't even know that was a thing, and then just that being the first result, I'm like

326
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:28,080
what are you even on about, what are you even on about, what are you, what is that,

327
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,480
that's like a trifle, no leaf lovers allowed, mommy can I please have a beer, sure,

328
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:42,160
look at how successful the business is going, refluence, we're doing it, we're gonna have the

329
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:49,520
best tavern in all the land, I'm okay, when everyone leaves I'm actually gonna shove the

330
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:59,600
tables together a lot closer, and then I'm gonna rearrange the kitchen,

331
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:08,240
I lost money, oh and refills that's fine, okay what I'm gonna do pause, pause, pause, pause,

332
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:15,760
I am going to move everything like way closer because everything's like half a mile apart,

333
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:27,920
oh no, I just saw that loss, oh literally, all right okay so tables,

334
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:40,080
uh you know what, let's, oh my god let's, let's get right into the, oh the table,

335
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:49,360
maybe this would be really cute for like a layout as well, and there's like different ways you can

336
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:55,440
sit and stuff, rather than having it all grouped together, I think I might like that more,

337
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:03,120
so we need to think of the funk suede, would one refling please think of the funk suede,

338
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,800
oh that's too close, um I might a little bit, look, look, come on, come on, this is,

339
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:15,360
this is all a part of how the game works, it has to be perfect or else what's the point,

340
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:27,040
right one, and then two, and then a bin, yes, oh my god look at the funk suede, see here when

341
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,600
you enter, yes walk, walk, walk, and then you take a little look to the right, hold on let's go

342
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,920
the full thing, look to the right, you're like yes yes, delicious, you take a little look to the

343
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,240
left, you're like yes right, I'll make my pathway through here, yes yes yes, I like all the ambience,

344
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,960
see, we see, that's how you have to run a business, you have to think like a customer,

345
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,960
you can't think like a business owner, you have to think like a customer, do you understand me,

346
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:58,000
and I say yes, I think this is nice and a bit more

347
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,120
and then I'll put one table over, oh

348
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:12,240
can I go, let's see,

349
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,440
oh my god them tunes, them medieval tunes are hitting, first thing in the morning,

350
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:34,480
right you my kind and noble chef, you keep going in a different order than I ordered,

351
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:47,440
oh, sorry, oh no wait, I tried so hard not to say that, I tried so, I tried so hard,

352
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:58,640
but in the end it didn't even matter, so what he's doing is, I'm overlapping, over the fucking light,

353
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:09,440
what, so if I hold on, mommy's not got a brain, mommy's not got a brain,

354
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:17,600
go and storage, go and storage, go and more,

355
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:28,320
can you go somewhere else right now or am I just like perma stuck with a, oh well I'm just perma

356
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:36,720
it was nice, employees are stationed at, move employees to other locations or fire them,

357
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:43,200
I don't want to fire them just to move some furniture, hold on a minute game dev, hold on a minute,

358
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:50,960
well we're just doing it like this then, it's not the most efficient way I know but, oh the

359
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,600
just leave it the way it was, vain, oh you win game, you win,

360
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:02,560
you can't escape it, just embrace it, no I did so well not saying that,

361
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,480
that was purposefully right, can we line it up,

362
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:19,520
that was it right, no I missed, I missed, there's a gap, I missed, I missed,

363
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:27,200
I missed, hurry hurry hurry, hurry go, now wait hold on,

364
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:37,360
okay there we go, this is, okay and now what we're gonna do, controversial, oh no we're not

365
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:42,880
because we can't afford to, wait what's this then, it's just a fancier table, we put it in the middle

366
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:51,840
everyone's like staring at you, all right and then we'll get another, another, another one,

367
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:59,120
another one, unless, I just put a table of four in the middle, I don't really want to put people

368
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,240
off like that, you know you don't want to be sitting in the middle and everyone's looking at

369
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:12,480
you, you're like hmmm, okay and then we will put lights over here because we need to

370
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:22,800
expand, not of money, well I tried okay, I tried and then we'll get like a table and stuff, okay we

371
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:35,840
have, we have a new table at least, somehow this is probably a lot worse, I'm sure they can handle it,

372
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:43,600
I'm sure they can handle it, wait what's wrong, why are you so, she also said speed not carrying,

373
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,120
can carry four drinks, make it five then, drinks can be good,

374
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:56,320
the tavern's coming along pretty nice, I mean we finally got a floor, only took me,

375
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,520
what they have, oh there's a castello,

376
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:08,800
I didn't even call that, is there only a castello, is that it, we're serving people from the castle,

377
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:16,720
how was your, oh weary castle workers, how was your shift, was it shite,

378
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:24,080
we're gonna suffer, the tavern music slaps, well we are going to entertain and come in,

379
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:33,680
oh I can buy musicians, how do I do that, how do I do that, games, games, wait people wait,

380
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:41,280
special, another, what is that, fire extinguisher, are you even nervous now,

381
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,400
musicians podium, I assume that's what I'm, maybe,

382
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:54,640
decoration seats, table kitchen, game, give them, oh my god are you going to station,

383
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,320
this item is not unlocked yet, oh my god I want dandelion leaves outside,

384
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,760
are you squidding me right now, hi Mina, thank you for the extended membership,

385
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,200
hey little sea weed, I hope you're doing well, I am, I'm just a sweepy bee,

386
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:17,040
but that's not gonna stop me, I'm just too emotional, so what musicians, podium, musicians

387
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,440
podium is used to hire musicians which attract more people to your tavern and make customers

388
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:28,880
wait for longer before they get angie, okay right hire is or I've got it, I will, I will,

389
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:37,360
actually I will, there's the red the day boy, and how are we for supplies,

390
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:47,440
yep there's supplies and stuff, you can go games on your tavern I think so,

391
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,240
I mean she's getting really good though, she's getting skilled up but he's,

392
00:50:53,200 --> 00:51:02,160
oh he can level up to speed, uh drink pouring speed, that makes sense to put up,

393
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:13,120
chef can just speed for dessert, why no, oh maybe I should even out and do a main course,

394
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:19,600
okay so everyone's level enough, we're all getting experience, you're even a full-time barista,

395
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:27,440
I mean I was a waitress, I got to make drinks at my jou, because you don't need

396
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:36,640
like a tarotificat to pour a drink, so I got to make drinks for people, I don't know if I ever

397
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:42,080
told this story, I had, okay build a takeout counter so you can attract new customers who

398
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:50,000
don't want to sit inside but just order and take the food with them, oh just realize you can't see

399
00:51:50,000 --> 00:52:00,960
my cursor, there we go, you can see my cursor now, build a wall with a counter, buy the takeout

400
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:13,520
counter, buy a packing table, wait for customers to start ordering their food, um yes I served

401
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,440
Japanese customers, it was three Japanese girls and they were using like Google Translate to talk

402
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:26,720
and they just ordered three hot chocolates and like I got to make them up and all that type thing

403
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:35,120
and then when I put it down on the table they all went like, they were like, oh my god this is so

404
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:41,360
precious like because and then like they said thank you in their acts, I was like oh my god, oh my god

405
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:52,320
I get it now, thank you umi for the red, I promise I have that ASMR, oh wait I might let

406
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:58,640
say that we have an ASMR class, I may have let the leak, I'm sorry I let the leak, okay okay I

407
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:04,960
didn't mean it, hi thank you for the redirect, I will very quickly give you that wrench so you

408
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:12,080
stand out because you need a wrench, oh I just added my own live stream to my watch later list,

409
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:18,160
that's how much of a panic I'm in right now, oh that's me, please be quiet, um I literally,

410
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:30,560
okay, not only do I spoil um Veal Ur plans, I also spoil plans I have with people that are

411
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:41,440
willing to collab with me, oh yeah, but thank you for the read, hi I'm Stronecals, I'm Scottish one

412
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:47,200
from Veal Ur, you know that company where we're naughty naughties, but we're actually

413
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:53,440
surprised surprised we're not that naughty on YouTube, except Emi you know she she got a strike

414

447
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,360
there are no fire extinguishers on floor zero

448
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:43,200

449
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:51,520
oh so now you credit the refunds yeah when the when the joke goes down badly

451
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,960

453
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:21,360

459
00:58:55,600 --> 00:59:01,440
what's going on here what am I trying to achieve where I'm trying to build the fire

460
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:08,560
extinguisher because the game is making me worried because it's like you don't have right

461
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:16,240
how about no we can't hear about near where where's the best place to put this I don't

462
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:25,680
know oh so that's allowed to go on the light but the other thing isn't right music that's massive

463
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,080
um

464
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,880
I feel like it has this actually has to go at the back of the

465
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,600
oh that's big

466
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:51,200
eight songs plus seven guess wait 10 seconds more for on the floor

467
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,480
have I got an extra 50 quid a day I don't even think I've got enough money for that I think I

468
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:04,240
would have to buy the takeout window first I think I'll extend the back here and then make

469
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:07,040
the takeout window because that is rough

470
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,760
furthest in gonna make it far away in the corner

471
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:21,360
finally our scottish cuttlefish was playing a game for her just have a good one ah it's a good game

472
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,960
grabbing some chinese get some sweet sour rip well we don't serve sweet sour ribs in middle

473
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:35,520
sorry that's that's not for that's not what we do here we do oh my god how do I increase my

474
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:43,200
money sold and earned is it really just up in the drinks I mean wine

475
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:52,640
you get these special guests by organi what no that's not right wine I guess wine and ale

476
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:58,000
it's a 75 persons okay so the more variety and what I offer the more I'm going to get

477
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:06,640
all right I think what my objective will be then is just to fill this place with seats everywhere

478
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:15,360
doesn't matter where I'm just a min maxim the seats right now do we serve fried elf ears

479
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:24,320
you can say that quality of customers improve with expensive drinks I think that might be what it is

480
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:38,560
um because I'm enjoying I don't know if I should get a big ass tea oh my god yes I want that right

01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:44,240
we're gonna get that table next I want big big grand duest table okay

482
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:50,880
that's what we're doing next just seats to stare at the people you literally like

483
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:56,800
right now there's I think there's enough distractions like going on so people aren't

484
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:01,280
just staring at each other why does this the decorations that's going to change everything

485
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:11,600
wait I only have rough that's it a rug no I'm not making the tavern is an introverse hell literally

486
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:16,640

487
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:23,040
those two tables like the weird ones here around the musician and then kind of spice it up a bit

488
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:28,960
you know you oh wait I need to put a staircase somewhere if we wish to expand you know I'll

600
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:46,480
or would it be a chef no can't it be a chef it would be a waitress right uh mood is not

601
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:55,280
affected by cleaning gets five bucks tips for every food served whoa that's op gets five tips

603
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:16,160

604
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:23,200

607
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:45,600
is it okay yeah okay the waitresses do this counter as well

608
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:53,840
right okay okay yes we need two waitresses in order to do this so she packs it there and

609
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:58,160
then gives it away well what 27 coins for a loaf of bread

610
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:05,920
bit of an upcharge don't you think the citizens need to eat too you know

611
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:13,360

01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:20,480
bucks tips are we min maxing the real answer right you were the new hire where's the other

01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:36,640
you don't do food like at all how about that or take out and then you don't do cleaning at all

615
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:47,120
but you do food and take out so you work around each other

616
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,040

01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:28,960
okay this tavern's starting to look like an actual business now people that's right okay

645
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,840
weird things and then same for the other one as well

646
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,160

647
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:43,120
oh did you level up no you're about to get some xp grow up get some xp now you can level up

648
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:48,800
nope i missed she's too fearful the game's bugging out i think because i told them not to do it in

649
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:57,200
the game's like hmm but that's not in my coding please okay up speed while carrying sure

650
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:10,560
the chef's like damn no one ordering yet that's not my problem uh carry six drinks why not

651
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:20,560
okay uh huh oh yeah new checks on any lake to find out about fire risk

652
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:32,480
low risk of fire 26.5 chance per week well i've been very lucky so far

653
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:38,960
serve only main courses for the whole day hire some musicians i'm working on it i'm

654
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,760
so i got awarded that money by accident because the event definitely

655
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:54,400
and i don't seem to have anything towards right forget that uh fire police grill no wait it's the

656
01:23:54,400 --> 01:24:04,880
same again right just the adventurers good to golly does the chef have this stuff to make the food

657
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:14,880
yeah i bought tons of stuff he's full i don't know i don't know if i bugged him out

658
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,960
okay that's a full day he didn't make a single thing

659
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:33,040
i'm finding that mildly hard to believe that no one or dared anything that's right i clutched it

660
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:36,880
and now no one's coming in

661
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,480
oh there you go angry customers no

662
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:50,720
he's just chilling collecting the shit he literally is as well because i'm not sure what to do

663
01:24:55,360 --> 01:25:01,200
okay okay today he wants to cook okay that's fine sure we gave him a day off look it's perfectly

664
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:08,400
normal to need a break from work okay that's all i'm saying and you could also bring your own

665
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:14,640
chunk of meat to the tavern the barkeeper will cook it for you they probably would back in the

666
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:17,040
old day but uh

667
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,440
how dare i be tired i can't believe it i'm shocked either

668
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:34,080
take it spent his day off watching people at the tavern he wasn't cooking because the girls

669
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:39,680
weren't getting the order because you put them off the task i think so i took i put the main one

670
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:47,600
off the task and the other one wasn't having it so balls that up slightly but we can recover right

671
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:54,800
if we make it if we're at 700 i'll get a barred rotate the barred towards crowd rotate the band

672
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,520
same as premium yeah that sounds right

673
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:05,680
a fire broken your tavern on floor order your staff to go extinguish and they will do their

674
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:11,200
best to extinguish click on an employee find closest fire extinguisher and click it use steps

675
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:20,000
one and two in order to order employees things wait for the fire to go as if the podium that

676
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:31,280
hasn't even i just got the musician you water no what you water you water there is not enough

677
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:39,360
buckets i can only do one at a time no no no no come back come back oh you're so brave though

678
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:46,960
please extinguish and one i will cry some of your furniture burnt in the fire do you want to sell

679
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:58,800
it all and buy new yes just replace it my patrons no come back come back the fire's been dealt with

680
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,720
well i was gonna say like oh we've been so lucky we've not had any problems

681
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:08,160
the barred was a pyromaniac in disguise literally his mixtape is fire

682
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:13,360
i can't believe that the one time i get a thing wait so is he

683
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:19,600
oh pair date it's not like paramount no it must be paramount you'll be coming

684
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:29,040
i mean a technical hardening is about floor tail so like is this just you can go all the way up to

685
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:37,360
what are you get like 2000 per go oh tartan hey oh it's what oh wall texture tartan you're feeling

686
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:45,680
brave i'm not sure about that one i am uh not so sure to cook this food you have to have a crate

687
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:51,600
on a fireplace grill we're actually researching that until everyone's ran away because of the fire

688
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:59,040
you think you need to rehire since it's technically a new podium

689
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:07,040
you're so right for that i get to pay 50 quid so did that right at the end of the night we're not

690
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:14,880

01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,680
here and people can hang up their jackets if they want

698

745
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:10,880
i guess we'll have to shove over here for now once we have the money

746
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:20,640
because yeah i don't have staircases to put it upstairs so we're just doing it

747
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:27,360
i could hear her go it's johnny the quest giver i need one of your strongest potions

because of the event

753
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:06,080

754
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:13,920
and a belt and level up let's increase your tip chance because that seems to be the best so far

755
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:20,640
make the tables more claustrophobic i love that instruction

756
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:24,080

799
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:43,440
well i'm afraid we aren't making much profits today actually this is very true um when i worked

800
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:49,920
in the cafe if it rained i was secretly like so happy because i knew it meant i would have less

801
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:54,080
work um so did i get the cheese then

802
01:41:57,680 --> 01:42:03,120

how am i so low on money what did i do what am i doing wrong

805
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:21,280

806
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:35,600
slashing around uh i want to invest in the ale because i think the ale would be like

807
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:45,520
the next like best seller you know i need even more weight more missing from the crate

808
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:54,480
there stop i'm trying to buy something i like rainy days but that's a really good reason to

809
01:42:54,480 --> 01:43:00,480
like them literally it was like the relief like i'd take the train and like it may have been miserable

810
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:06,000
like walking in the rain or that but like it felt so good because i knew it meant i didn't

811
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:14,160
have to do as much work and i could sit on my phone that work and it makes so the thing if you

812
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:25,040
have a busy day um it makes uh it makes the day go by like incredibly quickly um but you're exhausted

813
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:30,320
like you're really tired by the end of it however if you have a really slow day you can

814
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:34,880
kind of like muck about on your phone and like do what you want which is really nice

815
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:42,320
and like as is that my my boss at my waitress in job and he was like you couldn't have asked for

932
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:50,080
bit for you to sleep in um where would i put you to sleep i'd let you use the crate as a pillow

933
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:55,840
and you could smell all the ingredients inside and then when you get tired you can look at the

934
01:57:55,840 --> 01:58:01,040
glistening like candlelight the way the candle flickers and it will slowly allow you to sleep

935
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:06,880

942
01:58:51,760 --> 01:59:01,520

943
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:08,800
hallows mind you but i'm sure it's that fit does the tavern have a date with a winch on the menu

944
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:18,800
uh actually yes somehow i don't know how we to okay we got right uh we did offer that service

945
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:24,640
but unfortunately the current winches uh being spoken to by another client at the moment please

946
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:30,320
do excuse um i was gonna say that was fantastic timing but you kind of got sniped a bit there

947
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:42,240
up tips close up uh speed sure whatever and then up

948
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:48,560
uh then let's just even out his stats in general because he's got his only kitchen

949
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:58,560
area no i wanted that open sounds like your villagers are just the tavern master i think

950
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:10,960
oh we need four more for a fireplace bro i feel like that's going to be a big massive

951
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:20,400
hazard however which is a shame but we try oh they put the detail of the flies around the light

952
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:25,440
that's actually really good you wouldn't think they would have bothered with that to be honest

953
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:29,760
i mean i wouldn't have thought of that i'd be like nope that's a light there you go that's all you're

954
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:44,240
getting okay can i do any of these own 10 tables fine fine do i even have room for another table

955
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:52,080
sorry that's just going to be a table for someone who's not very social and then

956
02:00:52,160 --> 02:01:01,600
um sorry to the knights but i'm needing to get some achievement there

957
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:07,440
there this can be like a mysterious person that sits at this table

958
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:16,320
and they're always ready for a shocker running okay there we go we have the cheese we can finally

959
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:26,080
post right i need decorations people decorations get them up get them up on the walls i don't care

960
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:34,480
what it is what's that barrels with scrolls okay let's pop it in the corner we love a good

961
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:40,000
decoration who doesn't and then we've got a globe because the knights obviously need to see

962
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:48,960
what's around the world what's this a random bit on the wall okay that's really gonna spruce up the

963
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:58,640
place i found the fireplace oh that would look gorgeous oh can i afford it oh no i can't it's

964
02:01:58,640 --> 02:02:04,800
a thousand you don't have enough money no i don't you're actually correct can i agree with you okay

965
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:11,920
let's do coat of arms classic do i have enough prestige yet or am i going to be crying do i have

966
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:19,440
enough on prestige surely copy i'm surely i have enough prestige yes oh my god we did it we do the

967
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:28,080
wine tasting we did it we officially can do the wine tasting prestige go burger literally we can do

968
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:36,960
the wine tasting oh we can do it we can do it and then we can be awesome and super cool and

969
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:42,960
everyone loves the green dragon in yes the opening might have been shaky yes we only had two tables

970
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:51,360
but that wasn't going to stop us from becoming the best uh tavern in town yes we are the only

971
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:56,240
tavern in town no that does not take away from the fact that we're the best i assure you it's just

972
02:02:56,240 --> 02:03:04,480
a coincidence um but yeah we're doing it we're getting fancy i'm waiting we'll we'll play through

973
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:11,920
that event we'll see what happened although they call it an event it doesn't seem like much happened

974
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:15,040
really if i'm being controversial

975
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:24,160
when are we rebrand rebranding to the green cuttlefish tavern oh this is a Hobbiton though

976
02:03:25,120 --> 02:03:31,760
the brie one is called prancing pony from lord of the ring i think once we introduce the in the

977
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:38,480
in keep thing like the sleeping mechanic where they can sleep overnight then we turn it into a whole

978
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:47,600
house we'll we'll change our reputation not only do you get a belly full of meat you also get emptied

979
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:57,280
in other ways i'm here to appease the people okay sometimes the people just need a good time

980
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:03,760
uh and that's that's all oh we're out of ingredients we're always out of ingredients

981
02:04:06,160 --> 02:04:11,840
may i take a thagando beneath my ladies froh the waitresses get full of meat too

982
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:19,680
oh thank you thank you what a lovely tavern audience

983
02:04:22,240 --> 02:04:25,760
oh looking at a swimming stream should be appeasing enough

984
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:29,280
when we leave we have a full belly and so do the winches

985
02:04:31,120 --> 02:04:38,880
let's do kitchen decoration drink price yeah we're gonna drink right right we're doing it

986
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:46,480
we finally have the fancy no goi exactly that's what i thought goi i've got an event

987
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:53,600
you've successfully defended against the thieves oh look at how noble they are with their dresses

988
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:57,520
and oh he's got all the guests for this event have been served i think that's a bit premature but

989
02:04:57,520 --> 02:05:04,720
we'll take it all the guests have been seated they've not been served maybe it means seated

990
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:09,920
oh look everyone oh they're all having the wine let's make sure wine reserves are high

991
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:15,760
reeflings that's right open your mouth i want them i want to see them grapes see them grapes in your

992
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:22,480
mouth i like how that's the only available area i have to ferment wine it's just your mouth

993
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:31,280
beautiful stunning look everyone get and serve look at these cups all empty waitress waitress we'd

994
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:40,960

1046
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:54,960
you enjoyed this cute little game honestly i can't remember how much it was on steam i think there

1047
02:11:54,960 --> 02:12:07,520
was a wee bit of a price if it's um definitely um how to say early access and not pot like i mean

1050
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:27,200
beanie um i just feel like yeah there's a lot of discussion going about early access steam games

1051
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:34,720
and being like although i understand it's for developers and indie studios to be able to fund

1052
02:12:34,720 --> 02:12:38,720
their game before it comes out because when you buy early access you're being like yeah i want the

1053

finished product at the end of the rainbow and i understand you need funds to do it so i'm buying
