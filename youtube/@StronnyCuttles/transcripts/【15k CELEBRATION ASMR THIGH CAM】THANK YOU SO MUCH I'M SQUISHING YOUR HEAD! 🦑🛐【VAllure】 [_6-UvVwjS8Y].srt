1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I didn't, I didn't over the carpet? No? You can tell I'm a man. I didn't over the fucking carpet, shit.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I didn't over the carpet, oh shit, wait, no, hold on, let's not wipe fucking, hold on, I need you to shut up.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay, this is all contestant. Replay, hi, like it's me.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Look, I'm moving and stuff, I'm real.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Okay, so this is the week schedule. We have BioShock to spread over two days, because I like being spread, you know what I'm saying?

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And then I have a collab on Catarina's channel after Catarina and I though, but she's idle until November, so it's not wrong.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And then I have ASMR on a mannequin and camera, my usual strength down here.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And then I have a members watch launch ring.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And then you're turning me into a weeb, we're gonna do, you're gonna, we're gonna do a series of you turning me into a weeb, and we're watching Sugar Happy Life.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And then we're gonna turn it, boy robs the bank.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And then I'm doing Jane together with Amy, Actay, and Miss Ma.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And then we'll do a members ASMR afterwards.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And then we're doing a hand cam pop and cooking stream, and Kimberly and Vigor, welcome to join.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And then we're just gonna, I don't know the words, because I need to make sure I've got them right.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay, if that seems correct.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh god, you can see the webcam shadow.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No, this looks so scant.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You can see the webcam shadow is so clear.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh no.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't think I can do anything about that.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't think I can do anything about the webcam shadow.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I think I'm gonna rank that.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Alpha takes a lot.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Band-aid woman and Gimli Gobi.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
She's really good at scratching her hand.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hold on.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Excuse me woman, just to ruin the immersion.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh fuck, the board isn't even there.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Sorry, my PowerPoint is behind the piece here.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't even know very much.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Wait, what did you see?

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Wait, what did you see?

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What did I just show?

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Why is everyone saying dumpy sported?

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Did you not just see the back of my head?

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Hold on, fuck the ASMR.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Was that not just the back of my head?

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay, I went blurry.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thank fucking god, because I'm in a thong and nothing else.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay, let's sit back down again.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Panic over.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Okay, let's sit back down again.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Okay, let's sit back down again.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let's sit back down again.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Let's sit back down again.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Panic over.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I mean, this is probably the best I can do.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Holy dumpy.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This is the best I can do for the latex.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
My fucking ring line.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
ASMR, by the way.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Thank you.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Wait, hold on.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let me put my fucking tracker over.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
God, this is so scoffed.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You think I'm gonna...

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And this is why we don't listen to live.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You aren't really high volumes.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Have you learned your lesson?

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Hold on.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
This couldn't have gone any worse.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I am so sorry.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Hi.

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm Strony.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay, I'm in the frame.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm in the frame.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
First thing achieved.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Next thing I need to achieve for the 1530

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
is a celebration.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
ilot

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Did you get a walk now?

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Can you hear it?

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm sorry. I don't think I was wrong. Thank you for $55,000 subscribers. I know this is

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:49,000
This is why it's very hard to record for you someone. Look, I've still got income with fingers.

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I've still got the manicure and pedicure.

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh, it's a good name. Okay, thank you for this.

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Can you start? Have I broken it?

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Will you ever do a pan reveal? What do you want a pan reveal for?

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I mean, I guess. Why would you want a pan reveal? What's so important?

82
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Are you not wearing headphones? It's the morning. There's too many cables.

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's an absolute nightmare to do a webcam stream because there's extra cables introduced that will overlap correctly.

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Have you not heard about Inky Pan before? Wait, have I just been debated at this time for the first time in a while?

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Hand Arrows? Have you just opened me up to something I don't know about?

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Wait, what's this Hand Arrows?

87
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Girl, explain it to me. Sorry if you think you're kidding me.

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Maybe I'll just open them.

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
My little leg. I don't even see anything.

90
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
My little leg is shaking.

91
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I mean, I can do it.

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What's that?

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Some people like hands a lot.

94
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What? I thought it was friends.

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I literally thought it was friends.

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I can wear this thing and I'm in a rental.

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I wish you could see this thing on the floor. Yeah, this is an rental.

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I can literally levitate here with your workers.

99
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't think I've heard hands very much.

100
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
When you've got a carpet and a gaming chair.

101
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I think there's so much effort to give you a lift to the nowhere.

102
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
For free?

103
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes, for free.

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You can do lots of things with a model.

105
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You want to spend exorbitant amounts of money on a VTuber model.

106
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That's right, I'm a crittin' life.

107
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Sorry, my leg is just absolutely...

108
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Unless, maybe I could turn the light on.

109
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't know.

110
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh, I can turn the light on.

111
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh, I don't know.

112
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
If I had the money, I would have picked your anime girl.

113
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I said everyone everywhere.

114
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Hold up, I can turn the light on.

115
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh, no, you're missing my gaming chair.

116
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Can you see?

117
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I can't get it out.

118
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'll wait inside.

119
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh, that's not it.

120
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No.

121
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You can get sunset coffee.

122
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We can't hear you, my mate.

123
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Okay, I just need to stop the other thing.

124
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Just enjoy the ear sore.

125
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't get it.

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You heard it.

127
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Alright.

128
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Okay.

129
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Okay, there we go.

130
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I can whisper now.

131
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And I'm smart enough to know to whisper

132
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
when my long cup in the ears.

133
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Now, did we have a few missed calls?

134
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
No.

135
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Okay.

136
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay.

137
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Okay.

138
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Okay.

139
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Okay.

140
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay.

141
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay.

142
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Why is this bowl broken?

143
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay.

144
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Okay.

145
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You don't even have any money for it.

146
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
This is how long the microphone is.

147
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Wait an inches.

148
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Wait.

149
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Oh, no, this is centimeters.

150
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Okay.

151
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Okay.

152
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Excuse me.

153
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This is blissfully marvelous.

154
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Thank you.

155
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Thank you.

156
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Okay, let's see.

157
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
If we get the microphone.

158
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I forgot the ear sore.

159
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The length of the microphone ear

160
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
is six and a half centimeters.

161
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Now, I don't have long inches.

162
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Okay.

163
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So you're just going to have to show me tonight.

164
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Okay.

165
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Don't have to do all of this.

166
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Here, I'm going to touch it.

167
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So you're quiet.

168
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You have to be so gentle

169
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
when the ear falls.

170
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The place that you do is once in here.

171
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Don't touch me there.

172
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
She's touching my brain.

173
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm always breaking inches.

174
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Okay.

175
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah, my freaking pedicure

176
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
is still on my fingers.

177
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And it won't come off.

178
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
A little.

179
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I am so sorry

180
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
by the way

181
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
if you can hear the magpie

182
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
that's outside my window right now.

183
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
For some reason

184
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I have an emphatic magpie

185
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and

186
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
all it does

187
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
is sing inside the window

188
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
for cashier notes.

189
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's four a.m.

190
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's pitch black outside

191
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and it's currently singing

192
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
for cashier notes.

193
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Okay.

194
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Since you have our pillar handy

195
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Okay, so all cashiers

196
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
have their notes right behind

197
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and just right behind them.

198
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So we can break it next week.

199
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Okay.

200
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Okay, time to squish you.

201
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Please squish you, Dave.

202
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Okay.

203
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Would you like some thigh pads?

204
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Okay.

205
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Okay.

206
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I can't take this to me.

207
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

208
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah.

209
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
My thank yous are ready

210
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
to subscribe.

211
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I may not fall asleep

212
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
for 12 hours yesterday.

213
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Sorry, big mistake.

214
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Bad cash.

215
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Okay.

216
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm going to lower the volume

217
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
so you can see how much I can crush the microphone.

218
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Okay.

219
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Okay.

220
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Okay.

221
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Okay.

222
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I can't press my hand.

223
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Okay.

224
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Take it.

225
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Okay.

226
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Okay.

227
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Okay.

228
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Okay.

229
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Thank you for the support

230
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
for the gifted membership.

231
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I can't believe I'm so much more resilient.

232
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You're so beautiful.

233
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Thanks.

234
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm really sure.

235
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It will be wonderful!

236
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Actually, everyone Capitol

237
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
has reached about these

238
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
career services and featured work.

239
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You've been so long as I wonder

240
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
if I'm gonna hold it.

241
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So we have 4 of us on a tag.

242
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Okay, I'm just gonna meet

243
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
them when I get school.

244
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yeah.

245
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I don't know, I don't know

246
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I just really hardly bounce

247
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
and so

248
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I want to

249
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I want to

250
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I want to

251
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I want to do one more thing

252
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I want to

253
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I want to

254
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I want to

255
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I want to

256
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I want to

257
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I want to do it

258
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I want to do it

259
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I just want to

260
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,020
explore

261
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,000
I just want to

262
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I just want to

263
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I just want to

264
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
explore

265
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I just want to

266
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
explore

267
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
explore

268
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
explore

269
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I just want to

270
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
explore

271
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
who?

272
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
who?

273
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
who?

274
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
who?

275
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
who?

276
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I need you to take your hands off of me

277
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I need you to take your hands off of me

278
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
what?

279
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
what?

280
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
what?

281
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm sorry

282
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm sorry

283
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,520
I feel like I'm supposed to do exactly that

284
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,800
Thank you, Archie, and cause I don't know if any of you can even understand me

285
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm afraid that I can still hear you a little bit

286
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Do that kind of thing, Archie

287
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I feel like I'm supposed to do exactly that

288
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm trying to get that

289
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm trying to get that

290
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I feel a little touchy just between your ears

291
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I feel like I'm pulling my hair

292
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It's going to squeeze me

293
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You want to be squeezing harder

294
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You should know it's going to be easier

295
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm just very dull

296
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I don't want the tongue

297
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'll breathe it to the thigh

298
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Does it feel like this side?

299
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Is that a good sound?

300
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I can't hear it

301
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Is that a good sound?

302
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Is that a good sound?

303
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's spectacular

304
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Do it close to the ear

305
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
This is close to the ear

306
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
without blocking the sound

307
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I so like it

308
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Don't want to leave your other ear

309
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
My earjobs are going to bend

310
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Cut down, eh?

311
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I can't hear it

312
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Okay, now write my thighs

313
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
What do you think?

314
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Write them on a scale of cuteness

315
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
out of 10, right now

316
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
of Kawaii name

317
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
If maybe if they were skinny or they'd be cure

318
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I can't go down too much because I'm wearing a thong

319
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
and nothing

320
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Okay, cuteness for 10

321
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Okay, what about strength?

322
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What do we think on the budge scale?

323
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Come on, you can't have thighs without a little budge

324
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
How do you think I go?

325
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
This beach, okay?

326
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The cuteness of a kitty

327
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
The strength of a lion

328
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Thank you for the super chat

329
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
and half of love

330
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Budge, perfect

331
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Oh yeah, you like it

332
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And then on the end say there's budge as well

333
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You budge on both sides

334
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Okay

335
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I just have to make sure you enjoy

336
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Okay, now time to squeeze

337
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
the absolute crap out of you again

338
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Thank you all for becoming a member

339
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
and rockstar

340
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Would you say thank you for the meal?

341
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Okay, time to squeeze

342
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Why not?

343
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
What's going on?

344
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Okay

345
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Okay, we didn't need that many

346
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Let me do it in my life

347
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I'm sorry

348
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I can't feel my legs

349
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Okay

350
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I feel the chair to be my face

351
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Thank you in the whole bed

352
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Wait, can you hear this?

353
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Like that

354
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
That's what you should be saying

355
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Okay

356
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Okay

357
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Do like this

358
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Maybe three

359
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Maybe two

360
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And this is the other one

361
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Okay

362
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Then grippers

363
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Put them grippers on

364
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Okay, Mrs. Spiky

365
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
We already did

366
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Okay

367
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I don't have this fucking chair

368
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
No, maybe I should pick this one again

369
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Hold on, I've got it

370
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It's because I'm wearing tights

371
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's not like this

372
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Okay, I can pick it up

373
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I can do it

374
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I can do it

375
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Shit

376
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Okay

377
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It's because I'm wearing tights

378
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Okay, just ignore the fucking chair

379
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Squeaking and everything

380
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I can't

381
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Rip the leggings

382
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I managed to

383
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
If I can get my

384
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I'm gonna wedge my toe in between

385
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I swear you're the grippers

386
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It's because I'm wearing tights

387
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
There's no grip anymore

388
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
The sweat is being taped

389
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Okay

390
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm scared with my toes

391
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Okay, you have to believe

392
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Just trust me bro

393
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Again, you didn't hear the squeak

394
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You get the massive chair

395
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm glad you enjoyed it

396
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah, crimson, ti crimson

397
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I'm gonna do any tactic

398
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Where I put my thigh butch on the ear

399
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Okay

400
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000

Thank you

408
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000

460
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
doesn't really matter

461
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:18,780
I want to make my ears smart

462
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Okay, you hold my heart, okay?

463
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I can give you a heart beat, easy, easy, no, excuse me.

464
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Hold on, I'm procrastinating.

465
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
This is why it's my sweaty hand.

466
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Okay, where's my heart?

467
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Oh my god, my galaxy.

468
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I can hear it.

469
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I don't know if you hear it at all.

470
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:21,020
Do you hear the drumstick? No, it's from my

471
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:32,000
heart.

472
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Oh my god.

473
00:41:44,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I'm just doing my job.

474
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Please flex guys, I don't know why I have to do that.

475
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
That's why you flex again, but because you don't have any muscles.

476
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Open up.

477
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I'm just doing my job.

478
00:42:43,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Open up.

479
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Open up.

480
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I'm just having to lie back very awkwardly for that.

481
00:43:43,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm just doing my job.

482
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:27,000
These are my calves, so they don't really get in my thighs.

483
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I'm just doing my job.

484
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I'm just doing my job.

485
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Okay, now the chunk, because my thighs are underneath, so now they're extra juicy, because my chunk.

486
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Oh, this doesn't look as good though.

487
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:13,000
It doesn't look as good.

488
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Okay, we're experimenting. This is the first time we've done something like this, so we can't get it right all the time.

489
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Ignore the cardboard that's on my floor, that's for my PC, because my PC sits on the cardboard.

490
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Don't open the carpet, because you can't open your PC directly on the carpet.

491
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Thank you Grimson, for his support.

492
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Thank you, we've assigned it with this wonderful iPad, we're just swaying around.
