1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm gonna cry in my ankle.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Wah!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Wah!

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's up.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's up.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I think it's up.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I've just booted this freaking game

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and the music!

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh my gosh!

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Are you there?

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hopefully I'm live.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I know I've started like nine minutes early

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but I'm just sitting here

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and I'm like,

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I don't want to wait the nine minutes

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
for when I'm supposed to start my stream time.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I just want to start now.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So I'm starting now.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I just need to make sure I can see I'm live

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and then I can close my stream.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay, yeah, it says I'm live.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm so sorry I've been boozled.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes, I put in the wrong date.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I put in the wrong hour.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Shocking behavior.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Um...

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I have

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the most kind of like

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
saddest start to a stream so far.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Um, I got on Marshmallow

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
but sadly due to text

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I cannot see what the tone is behind

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and I've read that Marshmallow

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
is like a veiled threat or something

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
but I just want to say

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
to the person who sent me a cat picture link

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
like an actual picture of a cat

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
um, I don't know how to break this to you.

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I got my payloads in March

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
after a very rough time

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
where I realized that life was too short.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I've not owned a pet.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay, since then

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and my payloads came into my life in March

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
so please, like,

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't know if it was like a weird threat thing going on

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and I know for literally everyone else

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
this makes no sense

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
but I can't read tone in a text

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and it looked like a weird veiled threat

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and I just like

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I got my payloads in March

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and yeah

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I don't know what to tell you

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
like I've visited America as a child

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
at nine years old

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't live in America

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't know what's going on

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
so you identified yourself as not a refling

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
so if it's all good

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm just gonna, you know, stream here

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
with my reflins and we're gonna do our thing

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
um, hopefully it wasn't actually a threat

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
but if it was

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
then hey ho, I've addressed it

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and I've negated what your

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
evidence was

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
purely on the basis that I got

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Gimli and Vigo in March

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and that's when I got my payloads

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
so yeah, I apologise for that

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
making absolutely no sense

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
to literally everyone else

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
but good morning, good evening

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and good afternoon

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
it is a wild ride

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
you play two games of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm literally not even on my third game stream

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I've never done a second game stream variation

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and it's like oh

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't think it's a threat

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
but at the same time my brain's telling me it's a veiled threat

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
so I'm just gonna address it that way

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
if you didn't mean it, sure

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
but as I said

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't live in America

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I have two cats

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
that I got in March

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
they were adopted and

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
yeah, I don't know what else to tell you bro

91
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'd just appreciate if you left me alone

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and I'll just

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
be having fun with my reflins

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
so thanks

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
don't do that again

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
um

97
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
yes, anyway

98
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
now that we've got that part over

99
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Jesus

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
a little bit of a restless sleep

101
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
may or may not have had diarrhea

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
because I can't tell context

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
however

104
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
we're gonna be playing

105
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
a game

106
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
called Needy Streamer

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Overload

108
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I just opened it up

109
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and it gave me a kind of Windows XP thing

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Windows Vista was like

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
before me I'm like

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
99% sure

113
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
wait, Windows Vista

114
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't think I even had

115
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
wait, when?

116
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
wait, this is Windows Vista

117
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
no, I think Windows Vista

118
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
when

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
released it

120
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
oh

121
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
would my dad have had that on the console?

122
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
well

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
let's give it a

124
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Windows Vista

125
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
or Windows 98

126
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't know what version of Windows, okay

127
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
so we're gonna have a shot at this game

128
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't know what to expect

129
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
now a few reflings told me yesterday

130
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
that for a factoid

131
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
this game apparently has over

132
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
500 different endings

133
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
or I made that number up because someone said

134
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
the game had a ton of endings

135
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
now this is gonna be a shorter stream today

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
but the good news with it being a shorter stream

137
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
is I

138
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
might be able to release

139
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
my first ASMR

140
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
1k thank you audio

141
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
today

142
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
but I need to go edit it

143
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
but it's gonna be fun and it's clean

144
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
it's clean ASMR

145
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
it's literally me just rambling

146
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and tapping away on stuff

147
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and all that kind of thing

148
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
so it's cute

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
just a short 9 hour stream today

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm sure you can strap in the lads and lasses

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
then you worry

152
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
only 7 hours, yeah

153
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I was actually thinking Skyrim

154
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I've put down Skyrim as 212 back to back

155
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't know

156
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
if I should purposely wake up

157
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
right before stream for the Skyrim

158
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and then make a second room

159
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and then we'll do like 12 hours

160
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and then in the second room another 4 hours

161
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and then I think the following day

162
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
that 12 hour stream I can complete

163
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
the full achievements

164
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm not 100% sure

165
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I do have a honey tea with me though

166
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
so hopefully you have some water

167
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
some snackies

168
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and all that jazz

169
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
but yes, next week

170
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
our endurance stream is going to be

171
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Skyrim

172
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and we're also doing an endurance runescape

173
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
old school runescape

174
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I will tell you what world to be in

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I am going to start on a fresh account

176
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I am going to buy premium endurance

177
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
but we'll get to that when we get to that

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
you know what I mean

179
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
so let's stream into it

180
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
yeah, I'm a bit fatined

181
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
for streaming

182
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
really enjoy it

183
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
like some people

184
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
due to their circumstances

185
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
they can't stream every day

186
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
they find it a bit harder

187
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
and mentally it takes its toll

188
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
me?

189
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
um

190
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
like

191
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm about to try out this crazy game

192
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
for the first time

193
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't know much about it

194
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
apparently you can do implied

195
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
scenes in it

196
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
so I'm like

197
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
here we go

198
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
so I'm interested

199
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't know if it should just get straight into it

200
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
you guys can hear it

201
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
it's not too loud

202
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I was worried about the music being too loud

203
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I can almost turn it off on my end

204
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
but yeah

205
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
yeah some streamers like

206
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
just do it circumstances

207
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
but I just seem to have the perfect mesh

208
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
of like missing brain cells here

209
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
a bit of a smooth brain here

210
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
a bit more of a complex surface area

211
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
of the section of my brain

212
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
music's actually a bit quiet

213
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
right okay

214
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
it's just loud in my headset

215
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
okay

216
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I've turned off a bit

217
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm a wee bit close to my mic

218
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
but

219
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
right

220
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
oh it's got a little love heart

221
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
see that

222
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
so Mersey was theorised

223
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
that her heart

224
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
right this is what I theorised when Mersey thingied

225
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Mersey's pupils

226
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
are normal

227
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
before

228
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
her first

229
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
experience as a yandere occurred

230
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and then

231
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
her pupils broke

232
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and she can no longer love appropriately

233
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
like the concept doesn't exist for her

234
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
if you look back in

235
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Amy's lore video

236
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
you'll notice she

237
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
her pupils are normal

238
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
until she picks up that book

239
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
hey little small details

240
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
obviously my pupils have always been

241
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
the little cuddle fishes

242
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
she's broken

243
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I started to realise

244
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
that if someone has a feature

245
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
within their entire brain

246
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
it's just soup

247
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
honestly

248
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I would happily join

249
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
the

250
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
the study data group thing

251
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
you can hook me up

252
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
because I can prove that

253
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm pretty dumb

254
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
like yeah

255
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I didn't think to pay attention

256
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
no there's like

257
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
little small details

258
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
like in everyone's lore like

259
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
you know

260
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Aisy

261
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
has

262
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
scars from the polar bear

263
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
that she destroyed

264
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and then she raised

265
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
feral

266
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and like

267
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
kind of like

268
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
all kind of plays back into it

269
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
like

270
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
for Aisy's

271
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
audio work

272
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
she's actually

273
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
babe this is going to sound

274
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
terrible

275
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm so sorry

276
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
this is going to sound terrible

277
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
in

278
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
my

279
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
experience

280
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
if there is ever an audio produced

281
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
where you

282
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
listener

283
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
may or may not be taking

284
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
have been

285
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
taken

286
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
by

287
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
banpage of

288
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
by

289
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
the female performer

290
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
it always goes down really well

291
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and I consented Aisy

292
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
with the idea that she doesn't

293
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
know what

294
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
bincent is

295
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
she doesn't know what

296
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
bincent is

297
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
she just jumps on you basically

298
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
no prior warning

299
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
because she was raised feral

300
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
so it's not a thing like

301
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
if you're a bear

302
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
you grab what you want instantly

303
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
you want to eat

304
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
okay let's go down to the river

305
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
you want to claim this tree

306
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
heck yeah let's claim this tree

307
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
so yeah

308
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and

309
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I kind of made her like that

310
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I've not made her do anything like that

311
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
but

312
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
it's just kind of like a small detail

313
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
because everyone's like

314
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
oh this brat needs correction

315
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
or like oji-san you can't keep up

316
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and it's kind of

317
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
interesting to see that dynamic form

318
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
because the dynamic in my head was like

319
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
she completely has you wrapped around her

320
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
claw

321
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
type thing

322
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
and she does what she wants to do

323
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
which is so terrible

324
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
but look this is a fun thing about

325
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
like going from concept

326
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
to actually what's happening now like

327
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
as I said girls I've full control

328
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
type thing going on

329
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
my update for YouTube monetization

330
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
my statistics have updated

331
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and we've been told

332
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
like I can see on my YouTube

333
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
that I've met the watch hour

334
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
when I go to apply for monetization

335
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
it says I've only got 88 hours watch time

336
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and I'm like

337
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
right it's been four days

338
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I would like to apply for it now

339
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
like I have no idea why it's taking so long

340
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
to update it's crazy

341
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
crazy

342
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm going to take a sipping tin of my tea

343
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and then we'll see what this game provides

344
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
yes so I am warning you

345
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
it is a shorter stream today

346
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
however I do think

347
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Shibi is coming on in two hours

348
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I think A.C. is having a rest day

349
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Shibi

350
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
and me is a rest day for Azura

351
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I think Azura does double back rest days

352
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
what kind of tea

353
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
it's always the same tea

354
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
it's a British

355
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
like I think it's called black tea

356
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
or English breakfast tea

357
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
either variation with honey

358
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
but once having a tough time sleeping

359
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
is a gist thing

360
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
no Azura is doing ASMR

361
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
oh my gosh she's doing ASMR today

362
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm so excited for Azura's ASMR

363
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
please give her lots of tips

364
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
unironically

365
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
well in three ways

366
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
monetary

367
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
your advice

368
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and the other

369
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I am

370
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
she's so nervous but I know she's going to do perfect

371
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
like imagine listening

372
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I can hear it now imagine that voice going

373
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
by neural ear to ear

374
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and kisses

375
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
and I hope she hugs the mic

376
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't tell anyone what to do

377
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
but if she hugs the mic

378
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
heartbeat Azura

379
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
heartbeat and kisses ASMR

380
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
from Azura

381
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm already on cloud nine

382
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't know what to tell you

383
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I don't know what to tell you

384
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
also I may have infected

385
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Azura

386
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and Shibi

387
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
they said they might play Assassin's Creed brotherhood

388
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
in a later time because I've inspired them

389
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and they remember playing the games

390
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm going to be fangirling

391
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
so hard

392
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
if I get to watch them play brotherhood

393
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
but good morning

394
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
good evening

395
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
good afternoon or good time zone

396
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
like that one we fling said

397
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
no better feeling than chilling

398
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
your childhood game

399
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I didn't know Azura played that game

400
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
because

401
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
she spoke a lot of watching anime

402
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
in her 2.0

403
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
so I was like okay

404
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
on a scale of gamer to weave

405
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'd say she was a weave type thing

406
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
we aren't

407
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
real we fling's youtube is telling on us

408
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
ahhh

409
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
evening you

410
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
let's spread the AC love oh yeah

411
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
spread my AC all over your face

412
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
so Johnny you maybe want to replay

413
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
it's so good

414
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
we are going to revisit in october

415
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
but my morning has been good

416
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
my pants have been chat

417
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
if you haven't smoked

418
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
aww I never got a marshmallow

419
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
from a fart

420
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
from the toilet

421
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't think he is here anymore

422
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I think he is in the national cryo chamber

423
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
unfortunately

424
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,600
but like

425
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
but iknie started her stream yesterday

426
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and she was like

427
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Oh and I did it this morning

428
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
it's got a really weird marshmallow

429
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,840
and I'm like

430
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:09,280
can upset or offend anyone or anything like that. I'm like I can't read context so my

431
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,560
brain's like is someone threatening me? I don't know. But yeah, bizarre. Bizarre.

432
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,600
Ripterbiel one-pants shitted. Honestly it was fucking weekend, I'm not being funny but

433
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,680
it's absolutely, you know what, you know what, it's a British word that I don't use often at all

434
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:38,000
but I saw it in a tiktok recently. That's Pongen. Like P-O-N-G-E-D. Pongen. Pongen. Pongen.

435
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,560
So smells. It's such a bizarre word. I don't say that, I'm just like, that's Rican. We say Rican.

436
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:52,000
R-E-E-K-I-N-G. Rican. Pongen. Oh I'm sorry, that sounds Dutch. Pongendjunger.

437
00:14:52,640 --> 00:15:00,240
Hello. Mingen. Oh yeah, Mingen. Rican. I say Rican for smell. I think Mingen's like more disgust

438
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:07,200
but Rican is for smell. I'm British, you've never heard that. Pongen. Like when it pongs,

439
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:16,240
I wonder if it's an older word. My gran. My gran, I think she said, oh that's Pongen.

440
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,480
Although she made me laugh one time. She calls farts Windy Pops and I was like,

441
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,720
and I burst out laughing. I've never heard it being referred to as Windy Pops before and I'm like,

442
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,320
I don't know, okay. That's like, it's so polite and so British. Like if we end up getting a British

443
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,560
Virgin too, I'm making her say like, ooh Windy Pops, like in our wee English accent. I'll say

444
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,800
in that we could get a Welsh or Northern Irish, Irish. But sometimes Northern Irish don't really

445
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,480
want to be referred to as British, you know. And in a way, I completely respect and understand

446
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,440
like, let's not get into it. Wait until you learn. Wait until we do the history stream

447
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:04,080
of why the Irish famine, potato famine wasn't actually real. Thanks to the British Empire.

448
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:12,000
It's ridiculous. But yes, if you didn't know a lot of Irish migrated to America,

449
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,960
a lot of Irish migrated to Scotland, to different parts, to in search of working food.

450
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,320
Which is why a lot of you are like, I'm one eighth Scottish, I'm one eighth Irish type thing.

451
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:32,080
Heck yeah, you are. Because that's how mass migration worked. So you know that one eighth

452
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:39,120
Scottish in yet? That's right. I'm in you right now. I mean, I'm in your blood supply. I'm beating

453
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,280
around there. I'm seeking things in your body because you're like one sixteenth Scott.

454
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:55,760
As a British person, a lot of things were up for. Well England, with its sanctions on Scotland.

455
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:06,800
Please don't take strunnies in me. Oh yeah. I thought it was meant to be the other way around.

456
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,040
Look, it works both ways here. That's all I'm saying. Look, some people, look, some people didn't

457
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,560
like it. I respect that. Okay. All I'm saying is that if I had some sort of sensory organ,

458
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,160
it would give me more of a reason to explore even more.

459
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:28,800
One fourth Scottish, let's move actually. What percent campfire will we tolerate?

460
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,880
I see the most common.

461
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,880
I have 3% strunnie in me. There we go.

462
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,320
The potato famine was not fun for Ireland. Well, wait until you learn even more about the issues.

463
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:54,320
Maybe we can do an education stream about it, but I don't want it to be hate because I assure you

464
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,000
any English twat the day did not have any bearing on the famine.

465
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,920
But I don't mind doing historical education streams. The reason why Ireland kinetized them

466
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,840
with Scotland is because there was mass migration due to that. I don't mind a cheeky education stream

467
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,920
once in a while. I've actually really always enjoyed academics. Sadly, the social sides of

468
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:24,480
academics, I may have failed that part, but I've always enjoyed it. I'm actually going back to

469
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:32,560
college soon, which I'm excited to talk about. Not now though. Man's trying to run a business.

470
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,160
Well, I say that. I'm actually passing off it. So it's everyone else's problem, but mine.

471
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:50,480
But I am thinking of doing beauty school. But listen, hear me out, beauty school dropout.

472
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,160
That's a grease thing. The reason why I'm doing beauty school is because I want to get a certificate

473
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:06,000
to possibly, possibly open up like a little, so you might not know this. You know in salons,

474
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,400
like they have like a spare room. These rooms can be rented out for whatever you want.

475
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:16,400
And I was just thinking on the idea, like when, you know, time progresses, things,

476
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,160
things do their thing. I might have a pop up like little ASMR shop, but it's like just a little bed

477
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,560
in the room and it would just be so fun. And I love it because I am like genuinely passionate

478
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:31,280
about ASMR. Like I love the stuff about it. I've like tried to research some of the psychology.

479
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,800
I've came up with my own theories. Not everyone like agrees with my theories, but that's because,

480
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,600
you know, that's just what it is. But I think it would be a lot better. V sucky salon. Right,

481
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:46,080
you're done. You're done. You're done. You're done. Honestly, the skills you've learned running a

482
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:55,040
business is worth much more than the MBA. Well, you see skills, but literally I'm at the process

483
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:01,360
where I'm about to hand everything off now. Like I'm so freaking happy. And the only thing I need

484
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,520
to worry about is clippers. And there's the possibility for those of you who have an Oshi

485
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:17,680
desk and editing skills of the girls, I am 100% open like once things set up, because I know it

486
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,960
takes a while to kind of settle on an Oshi and be like, oh yeah, shit. Yeah, I'm going to watch her

487
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:27,360
consistently. If you have the time and if you're an editor, I am very open. If you wanted to be a

488
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:34,320
dedicated clipper or highlight editor for that girl, you're welcome to email the website.

489
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,000
Just to tell you right now, no, you do not get a open communication with a girl.

490
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,640
Everything is done through IWL messages. But yeah, if you really enjoy one of the girls and you

491
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,400
want to clip them or do highlight streams or funny moments type thing and want to get paid for it,

492
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,880
hit the website up because it saves me even more time because right now I'm today after the short

493
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:05,600
stream, I'm going to edit my 1k, thank you ASMR and then upload that. And then I'm going to send

494
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,440
away a few more clips for editing because the second guy we've got, poor guy, I've like left

495
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:18,240
him on red for like six days now and I'm like, oops. But yeah, I'm definitely gonna have to find a few

496
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,280
more clippers. I probably want to try two more clippers. But yeah, you don't like Vsucky, so you

497
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:29,440
would say that Vsucky blows honestly. But yes, there's opportunities. Like please don't think

498
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,400
that this is like a super closed off like thing. Like I'm happy to tell you about what the process

499
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,560
is like when it comes to clips. Like the reason why subtitles kind of jump at you in clips is

500
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:46,320
because that's what gets the monkey side of your brain to like keep watching. The editor for Mercy's

501
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,760
recent clip, I forgot to put credit in the blonde one. You can edit credit in the description.

502
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,640
Right, I need to do that. Mercy has a new short coming out and the way the editing style is just

503
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:07,680
captures the ADHD perfectly. It has insider knowledge about VTubers and like just really happy

504
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:14,800
with it. So if you can edit what Mercy's recently published clips are like, feel free to hit the

505
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:24,480
website up. I'm needing a few more clippers. I'm needing to get Sheeby needs clips very badly. I

506
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:32,000
need to put up. However, there's like so many little notes. I'm like, so I've told the girls to

507
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,680
cover up your for now. Like as you can see, you can only see my deck leotage at the moment,

508
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,920
because I'm a bit worried about what the heck's going on with YouTube right now.

509
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,840
I feel like there's still policy of these going, but that's just me. But right, let me finish this

510
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,760
team. We'll actually jump into the game because I have been yapping for 20 minutes. I'm not even

511
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:58,560
stop. Oh, that's ridiculous. Sorry. I'm so sorry. Goodness gravy. Once I get started, I can't stop.

512
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:07,920
20 freaking two minutes. That is terrible. Are you looking for clippers? If you look on

513
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:14,240
Mercy's most recent short, if you can do clips like that, that's pre made stuff where I just send

514
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,960
you the model and the audio and then you do the subtitling and all the other fancy like

515
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,920
then yes, definitely apply. If you mean clipping highlight sections in general, I again,

516
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,200
I'm going to I'm going to see what happens after a girl to stream.

517
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:39,760
Okay, I finished my tea. I came for the yapping. Honestly, don't worry. There's two

518
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:46,320
point. I was like half yapping, but it's so fun. Yes. Okay. What is this game about? Good question.

519
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:54,640
I actually don't know. So all I know is it's called needy streamer overload. I believe it is one girl

520
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:02,960
and there's a ton of different endings that we can potentially get. So we're going to check it out,

521
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,280
see how it is. I believe it's a click simulator. So I can't get annoyed at the gameplay because

522
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:13,120
this is my kind of thing like nice chill, doing my things. Veal over the company competition is

523
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:20,080
actually just who's the biggest yapper. Honestly, 20 minute talking, no gameplay. Honestly, this

524
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,560
game is each of our life simulators. Actually, okay, that's good. That's good. I was going to

525
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:34,080
play YouTube simulator and then I was going to call it like well, real or fail. Okay. Okay,

526
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:43,440
so there's day progressions. Okay. Okay, you ready? Welcome day one of five.

527
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:51,200
Man the way. No. Got the stream account. Time to log in and get ready. Click on stream and

531
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,880
This is where... Oh no, everyone knows I can't read now. It's got too fast. We'll be together no

532
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:33,280
matter what happens online. Whether I die or I get arrested or I break or I get stabbed or I get

533
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:39,840
flamed or I become god or go crazy. Virginia, thank you for the tip as well. That's got to

534
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,280
happen. The main reason I'm here for overall, thank you for the tip. We'll be together no matter

535
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:51,840
what happens. Oh, the internet is truly the festering cesspool of heck born from modern society.

536
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,360
But even so, I have nowhere else to turn to. Are you squidding me right now? Dr Resurgence,

537
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,680
thank you for the tip. You're awesome and I love your accent. Thank you so much for the tip. I appreciate

538
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,400
it because I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning. I don't want to get out. I don't want

539
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:16,480
to get a proper job. No, she's a need. No. I'm scared of other people. Adults pee me off and I'm

540
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:24,480
bum bum. I'm dumb dumb. And I still want everyone to fawn over me. She wants to be an idol and

541
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,400
streamers get fawned over and the most over the most right now. Oh god, everyone knows I can't

542
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:37,600
read. So that's why I want to be one. Thanks for sizing up all my gear and getting my stream

543
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:46,080
software running. Pete Chan. My name's Pete. Heck yeah, my name's Pete. When I send you a DM,

544
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,120
you can sometimes pick your own reply. When the time comes, make sure you think long and hard

545
00:26:51,120 --> 00:27:00,240
about what to say. Pete Chan. Pete Chan. Yep, you're my Pete Chan because you're so, oh,

546
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:06,640
wait, we're the manager. We're the manager. I mean, you're the only, this is the people that have

547
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,000
been emailed on the website. That's all I'm going to say when they're like, I want to be a talent

548
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,440
manager and they have no thanks. I mean, you're the only person in the world who understands and

549
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,560
supports me and you're my one true love and you're also like my producer so fit. Oh, that's

550
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:24,080
so freaking smart. Okay, you're super smart. No, you're super smart for naming me unlike me. So

551
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,800
you can guide me. You can tell me or anything and I'll do it. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do

552
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,720
this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Oh,

553
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:41,440
it's almost time. My makeup looks good. Got my wig. Perfect. Here we go. Here we go. It's time

554
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:58,560
for my first and go. Wait, this is late. Wait, this is good though. That would not have been cheap to

555
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,200
do.

556
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:28,400
Nice, cheery, cute. What? Stream is usual.

557
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,440
As usual. God, you're so cute. Cute. Kawaii ne. All right, so we're playing mod simulator

558
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:39,600
on ironical. Wait, YouTube mod simulator. Choosing comments. No.

559
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,280
Weird name.

560
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,440
Weird name.

561
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,960
Array of light illuminating the chaotic internet of today.

562
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,720
Bringing happiness to the nerds floating in this electronic sea.

563
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,760
Can I type myself?

564
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,920
Wait, so she gets stressed if I miss stuff? Oh boy, here come the nerds in the comment.

565
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:28,240
We're all here just to vibe. So don't be mean. We're all just here to vibe. There's no point

566
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,120
of just starting calling each other nerds. We're all just trying to enjoy ourselves.

567
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,640
A promise of future peace. I'm a little manic and moody, but that's all right.

568
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:41,440
Don't go depression on us. Is that mean? I don't know if it's mean or not. I wouldn't care.

569
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:49,360
I feel like I'm deleting all the comments. Go get therapy. No, right. No, don't be mean too hard.

570
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:58,640
The internet angel has descended. Thank you for gracing us. Cheers. Yeah, read it. Oh,

571
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:07,760
I can tell her to read it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Huh. We got a little Minecraft.

572
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:23,680
Wait, wait, wait. Get out of here. No, don't read it. Delete it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

573
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:33,280
delete it. You silly sausage. No, don't delete it. Why? Oh, what was that?

574
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:44,080
Or do I tailor to? Okay, I don't. For goodness sake. I'm a rubbish mod, honestly. So when you're

575
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,160
going to show it, see, I would leave that in because I've been like, I've got bikini models.

576
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:55,680
I'm the terrible mod. I feel like I don't mind. If it's a way for you to get your stuff out,

577
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:01,760
I'm sure. And while I'm at it, I'm going to be the biggest streamer on YouTube. That's a threat

578
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,400
and a promise. Oh, my God. Threaten is more Kangol. Is it Kangol or K-Angel? I feel like

579
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,920
Kangol sounds like Kigo. Right, group Kigo exercises replaying. You've got my support.

580
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:19,680
Go back or go home. So I'm going to shoot for a million. Jesus, lady. You've got my support. Yeah.

581
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:29,520
K-Angel, Kawaii Angel. Oh, Pepega. She literally, an interesting newbie has appeared. No one even

582
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:35,120
freaking types newbie like that. That's ridiculous. Show us what you've got, baby.

583
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:41,680
Hmm. Hmm. Anyway, there's still a lot I have to. Anyway, there's still a lot I have to learn,

584
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,840
but I'm still going to be here. I can't wait to meet you all. I think that's what she sounds like.

585
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,800
Nice to meet you. To meet you. Nice. Time for a challenge.

586
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,360
Thank you for greeting us.

587
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:07,840
I'm K-Angel. Get out of here. Oops. I don't think I was supposed to do it. You get out of here.

588
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,320
Oh, and if you're a backseat gamer, do me a favor and stay away please. Well,

589
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,640
what's wrong with freaking getting your hand held? They're games. Nice to meet you. Subscribbled.

590
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,680
The birth of a legend. First stream complete. At the end of the stream, I will respond to the

591
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:31,680
comments you choose. The fans love that, so aren't I so kind and generous? I guess. Twitter.

592
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,000
Hi, everyone. Wow, this is my first. This is my first time meeting all of you.

593
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,920
I'm only going to each one. You're Internet Angel. What did you guys think of my first

594
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:50,960
stream? I hope you like it. Oh, I can't read that fast. Jesus. Oh my God. Oh my God. I'm still

595
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,520
shaking. Did you like my performance on stream though? So when she, her voice is deep here,

596
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,880
K-Angel finally descended upon the world after we spent so long mulling over it. We've got a

597
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,280
thousand more subscribers, huh? But that's not enough. I want more people to fawn over me.

598
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:17,520
We're only just getting started. I like the bunches. Best design. I need at least one million fans to

599
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:25,040
satisfy my desperate need for approval. That's crazy dialogue. I wonder what Dev team made this.

600
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:32,000
We got to get that. We got to, we got to get to that within our month. That's the most motivation

601
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,680
I've got. Oh, she's done it in a month. So let's get this, let's make this month count.

602
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,320
Okay, we have 30 days. We can make K-Angel the biggest streamer in the world if we work together,

603
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:53,760
right? Uh, uh, yeah. Yup. I love you so much. Oh my God. I really hope we can pull this off.

604
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:00,640
I'm counting on you. We're going to make it happen. It's her dream. We have to make it happen. I might

605
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,400
break if you push me too hard, but when that happens, we can just destroy the internet.

606
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:16,720
And anyway, I'll be counting on you tomorrow too. Good night.

607
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,040
Wow. Okay, so it's a 30-day sim. Okay, okay. Day two. Day two. All right, all right.

608
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,320
Good morning. It's my first morning as an official streamer. Wait, it's already noon.

609
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,280
Uh, I'm just not a morning person at all.

610
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,440
I was a bit, I was a bit too slow on that. Oh, well, anyway, since we're aiming for one

611
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:49,840
million subscribers, we still need 999,000 more. But first, let's start small and go for 10k first.

612
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:57,360
We'll get there in no time. And as you know, I'm completely useless on my own.

613
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,200
Haha. So you need to tell me what to do every day. I know you'll make the reddit, right? Is this

614
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:12,080
terrible of me to say? But as like a manager point of view, that's actually super easy to direct

615
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:19,760
people like this. Like, just tell me what to do and I'll do it. So I'll do everything you tell me.

616
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,360
Really, I have complete faith in you, P-chan. I'll follow all your orders perfectly and I promise

617
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:32,240
I'll become the best streamer. Literally, I like feel so bad. But like, this is like the perfect

618
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:41,280
employee. Because if not, I think I'll break and fall apart or I could break you. I don't want to

619
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:48,240
be weak. Oh, fuck it. I'm fucking her. I could break you myself. Yeah, you could. Oh my, wait,

620
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:57,040
she reciprocates. Oh my god. Oh my god, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, my penis typed that on the keyboard.

621
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,680
I'm sorry, I couldn't. I'm sorry. Please don't be creeped out by a manager. Right,

622
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:14,800
how do I tell her? Are we done? Hang out. Oh, okay, okay, hang out. New idea incoming.

623
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Sleep. New idea incoming. New... medication. Oh dear, that's not good. Oh, she feels okay.

624
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:35,040
So I'm definitely mental darkness. Wow, okay. Oh wait, what does that say? Collect ideas. Okay.

625
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:44,560
I comprehend. To collect ideas, I want you to search the internet for the current Twitter trend.

626
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,760
Of a VTuber model. Social media puts her stress up. Oh,

627
00:36:53,280 --> 00:37:05,840
pre-streamer, vanity search. No, don't do that. Video streaming? No. What's ST? I don't know.

628
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,480
Dender. No, you don't need dender hen. Go follow the latest VTuber trend. I don't care what it is,

629
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,000
but go do it for me, darling. Someone I met for the first time today told me you looked like you

630
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:27,120
would be really into underground male idols. Do I really? The task manager will show you...

631
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,400
I'm learning, I'm learning. Conspiracy theories are always so interesting to read about. It's so

632
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,560
funny seeing people argue about whether they're real or absolute BS. I never get tired of it.

633
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:50,400
Okay, okay. You're actually so smart. I don't... Idea gone. But you know, I feel like if you go

634
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,480
deep enough, you'll end up buying into it sooner or later. Curiosity killed the cat kind of deal.

635
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,840
Well, I'm fine though. I never let that happen to me. I'm the most rational and logical girl in

636
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:05,360
the world and the only thing that drives me crazy is you. Okay, if it's reciprocated love, then I

637
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:12,880
don't feel bad about being weird. But anyway, I figured that conspiracy theories would make

638
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:19,680
for great content, so let's start this off with a banger. Okay, okay. We can only stream once with

639
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,800
the idea we get from commands marked with an exclamation mark. If we stream with a low-level

640
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:31,920
idea, we'll be able to find another idea on the next level up. Comprehend, yes. Go to dust.

641
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:40,800
Is that my only choice? I don't really want to cross route. Okay, it's making me go to dust.

642
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:50,240
I think I messed up your medifix recommendation because I was using your account to watch stuff.

643
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:55,280
I'm sorry. That's fine. We just... Wait, you can't stream... Do you actually need to go to bed?

644
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:03,360
Is she tired already? Do you need to sweep, little one? Or do you need to go again?

645
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,840
You want to do internet again? Pre-stream alert goes up. Our stress...

646
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:19,520
It will change time tonight. Okay, okay. I wanted to buy myself a super comfy couch,

647
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,600
but if I did that, I think I would never leave it. I think it would turn into a blob.

648
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,760
Go to night, and then she can stream. So she can stream at night. Can I want to dye my hair pink

649
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:37,520
something? I think even more people would love me if I did that. Pink is definitely an idle hair

650
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:44,960
colour for VTubers. Very common. I actually didn't want pink VTuber, but I think we'll

651
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:52,000
definitely have a pink one in general, let's be honest. Right, chat and chill. All hail the internet.

652
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,880
I think Zatsu. So this is her doing her 2.0, so we'll do Zatsu. Begin. Transform!

653
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:11,520
Honestly? I'm digging this so far. This has already blown me out of expectation out of the war.

654
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,480
Okay, very, very, very. Stream speed as usual.

655
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:23,840
Hi cuties! I'm the internet angel. Okay, angel. I kind of sound like, um,

656
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,440
what the heck, the rabbit from Sonic Heroes?

657
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,480
Why does she always say bless or whatever? Eh, clearly because she's...

658
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,720
You're blessed to have her in our life? You're so quiet. You're super cute.

659
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:52,560
I love the internet because all of the lovely people are willing to listen to you alone and

660
00:40:52,560 --> 00:41:01,520
other attention whores. Parish! Why, angel? Thank you for your super chat. I love you.

661
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,320
I keep reading that as Kigo. I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.

662
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,880
Oh my biggest fear is the end and then I can imagine living a life not being needed by anymore.

663
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:19,280
No, this is too real. Oh no, we're about to put on Mr. Kitty as the hours pass on the

664
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,800
little notes that I hear. She sure is bold for a new streamer.

665
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:31,280
Do I need to speed this up?

666
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,800
She says she loves me. She loves me? She loves me now. She loves me. I don't know about the rest

667
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,800
of you, but your face sure is cute. Okay, well, I love it. This is the true mod experience. Honestly,

668
00:41:51,520 --> 00:42:01,440
can I speed this up? No, I can. I guess. No takebacks now. Chin hands. Oh, this is chin hands?

669
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:09,600
This pose? I got Mercy have chin hands toggle. Because it's all over if you get bored of me

670
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:14,720
and I don't want to die yet. Let's go! I'm going to need water so quickly if I'm

671
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:21,360
I didn't bring any more. Please don't die. Please don't die. Oh no.

672
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,920
I'm bored. Why would you super tip? I'm bored.

673
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:38,880
Let's have a look. See why Angel? I kind of messed up the super chats, but I've always been an Angel

674
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,480
since I was born because I'm just too kawaii. Please don't die.

675
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:52,160
People die and whether I live or die is all up to my bet. Whoa, stay there.

676
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:00,800
Oh, well, you are streamed. Thanks to everyone who came along to stream today. Sorry, I was

677
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,720
too new to this. Love you all. I never caught on days when

678
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Kegel streams. I'm so good. I can't read it. Right, Daisy, Daisy.

679
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,960
Dear P-chan, this is Saito from the bit creations. As per our last phone call,

680
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,760
your rent is still outstanding and you will have to pay. You have until the 10th to pay for it.

681
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,440
Oh my god, I'm going to get kicked out. Please forward your payment to the account details below

682
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,480
and contact me when you've done so. Regards. Please reply to this email with any concerns.

683
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:46,800
I'm sorry. What is this? Does this mean we need to pay all our rent by day 10? We're broke as heck.

684
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,560
We need to be able to monetize our content ASAP. We need to get more than 10k followers first.

685
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,840
Easy peasy for us. Let's go. Yes, yes, yes. Oh my god, you're such a hard worker. What the heck

686
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:08,080
is that though? That little bear thing. Right, I need you to... Your stress is really high.

687
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:21,040
How do I de-stress you? Hang out. Play game. Stress goes down by five... No, that's number four. That's

688
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:29,120
Four. Affection goes up between us. I don't want her to have to... What's this? Spend time together.

689
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:39,280
Her affection goes up and her stress goes down by six units though. I think we'll do that. No,

690
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:47,680
she needs... Wait. Wait, hold on. It says dot, dot, dot. Love is in the air. Stress goes down

691
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,400
significantly but mental darkness... Mental darkness goes down, affection goes up and stress

692
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:59,360
goes down. This is a win-win. This is the most po- like this is the best thing to make her feel

693
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:13,600
better. Sorry, but... Is that that game where it's like 120 levels? I promised to never portray you

694
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:25,360
guys, so please keep on showing me all your love. Oh, nori. Nori Nelly. Uh, what taken? No, what?

695
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,120
This shows how much pressure I'm feeling. I might start acting weird if I get too high,

696
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:37,440
so watch out. I may even become more scared of the internet by the day. Uh, this displays how much

697
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,840
I love you. I'd be sad if I don't love you enough but if I love you too much it might be hard to

698
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:48,880
handle to try and strike a good balance. This lets you know how I'm doing mentally, how well I cope

699
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,000
with reality will change depending on the numbers. It might have a bigger influence over my future

700
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:04,480
rather than in your future. Uh, show me one hate. Show me one hate or who bothers to wear clothes

701
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,280
that fit them properly. That's the most bizarre thing I've ever read. Uh, we're definitely gonna

702
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:20,560
have to research tomorrow. Uh, we'll do conspiracies. Why are you now? Transform! Time for her voice to

703
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:29,760
go like this. Men here have each of her simulator. Is that how it goes? I know there's lots of end

704
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:38,160
ends there. The fixer of who controls them? What is that even mean? First time here.

705
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,640
Oh wait, no, sorry. I'm reading parts in the voice app. I'm not supposed to.

706
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:55,600
Do you guys like conspiracy theories? I know, I do. Have I read about them? But why?

707
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:05,920
Young nerds love these. That's American viewer spot. Annihilate this man.

708
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:14,480
Is this supposed to go faster than this? Oh, I love conspiracy theories. I'm excited, yes.

709
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:25,040
Okay, do you like conspiracy? So, I can... Oh, that's going too fast. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

710
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:30,240
Today I'll be talking about their culture conspiracy theories. Like the freaking, is it the ET game

711
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:36,400
that's like currently, um, dug into like a ditch and it's like 40,000 worth of games or something?

712
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:43,200
Some people say that I... Oh, this is going too fast. They wanted to do the Japanese masses

713
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,880
into nerds to numb them. Sounds wacky, but what if it did happen? I'm not a nerd.

714
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,280
Uh, I think we'll do a nicer super chat. I think we could do a super chat that makes

715
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,040
her happier than that. But then people get mad if you don't read them out.

716
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,520
Everyone watching now would be dancing to the tune of Three Minds Fonds.

717
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,640
Feels like you're going to eventually go off the descent if you...

718
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,000
What? Talking about conspiracies?

719
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,920
But it's okay, because even if you were off this...

720
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:27,840
I can't, I can't, I couldn't even moderate it. I'm not a nerd. I just want to know this what a nerd

721
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:32,640
says and she's gone just like that. Jeez, right. I'm not clicking that speed up option. My goodness,

722
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,960
what was that? You upped the stream speed, but I've tried to lure it, did I not?

723
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:45,200
Wait, is this her all? I will shiitake mushroom y'all on my privilege will all and will.

724
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:50,240
As long as one finds that they can stay blissfully unaware and even if someone does find it,

725
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,440
it's not like I'm committing a crime, even though it does feel like we're really just...

726
00:48:53,440 --> 00:49:00,720
Wait, so this is her all. Oh, and this is her main. Oh, that's a shame. She doesn't enjoy streaming.

727
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,080
Then you do it then. So, but you didn't have to stream if you didn't like it.

728
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,800
I don't know why we're... Can you write some good stuff about

729
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:17,120
thingy on ST for me? I think it'll be too obvious if I do it myself, so please.

730
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,200
Medication gives her an idea.

731
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:25,840
Diazipam?

732
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,960
One milligram Diazipam makes her floppy.

733
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:42,400
Brof. Brof. It's five milligrams that'll make you floppy, Hen. It's not one milligram.

734
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,760
One milligram does nothing. That's a tiddly wink of Diazipam.

735
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,320
It's someone who's got the anxiety maze. I assure you, it's five milligrams when you're

736
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:58,880
gonna feel it. Right, I am going to let her get a new idea by playing games. She used to play some

737
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:05,600
games. She's a lightweight, literally. All you need is a beat a blocker and you're good to go,

738
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:11,840
and if you're really not good to go, Diazipam. I hit my gacha a bunch of already. We just paid

739
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:17,360
money for that. Did you just spend money when we have to pay rent? Nothing beats a good games.

740
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:22,640
Humans were born to play, and I'm getting the hang of this streaming thing, so I want to do

741
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,360
a let's play. Let's do this. Yeah, that's exactly what you're supposed to do. Why are these reactions

742
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:32,800
so scuffed? You have a new idea for stream. Let's play throwback stream. Hey, that's what I did!

743
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:41,440
Go dusk, go dusk. Right, you can play again. I want you. I need you. I need you. I need you.

744
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:50,720
I love you. I love you. Atama no naka. I don't know what the tune is, but I've probably heard it

745
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:55,360
if it's that popular Japanese. I'll let her play twice so she can get two game things.

746
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,080
Need to grind, need to grind, need to grind, need to grind.

747
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:07,120
So I put a stress by four and affection up, but I didn't do anything. I just remember this game

748
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:12,080
I played when, where you become a big shot, who is a global influencer or whatever, I actually got

749
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:17,440
so into it, I ended up skipping it. What game is that I referenced to? I just remember this game

750
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:27,360
becomes some big shot who has global influence. What game? That must be a reference, but it's so

751
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:32,480
generic. But anyway, I know it's recently a lot of people these days like to play games where you

752
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:39,040
have to rule, power to rule the world and even reduce population and stuff. What are these references to?

753
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:48,000
They must be references to. Is the game, it's referencing itself? Oh, Pepega. That's very plausible.

754
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,480
And some people also truly believe that's what's happening in our world and make up these wild

755
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:02,000
boogie men to direct their rage at. Wait, is this because I looked up that conspiracy stuff she's

756
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,080
saying this? I don't blame them though. I think considering the times we live in, it's not so

757
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:12,800
strange that people want someone or something to be angry at. Not as, not as dissect in human

758
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:18,240
nature. Hold on, this game is, I love it already. What the heck, we're like human nature, but we

759
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,240
should all be working together. Please, this is my only wish as an internet angel. Wait,

760
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:27,600
Bob, I'm, I'm eating this up for breakfast. Like, I love the intricate like one human nature that

761
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:32,960
you need something to do. Sounds good, doesn't it? Well, I'm going to say that and see how the

762
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:43,680
Schumer's react. They are my, girl, do not bite the hand that feeds my goodness. Oh no,

763
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:49,680
she was talking about theories. I didn't, only one cover. Wait, am I going to turn her into a

764
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:58,320
politician? Can I turn her into anti-migrant factor? Please, can I turn her into our

765
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:08,640
migrant factor? Stop, stop anti-migrant factor. Let's go. E-girl anti-migrant factor. We believe

766
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:16,320
in the public owning the fricking things and the private sector does not own or have stakes

767
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:22,960
and that the people do not buy out mistakes, buy out companies that go bust because it's not the

768
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:29,120
people's problems for the private companies. Oh my god, yes! Revolution, yes! Oh my god,

769
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:36,480
this game's amazing. Hi guys, it's Chloe Angel, the Napoleon of the Streaming Wall. Who's Napoleon?

770
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,240
Right, not you. That's a terrible super chat and you should be embarrassed, but we'll put it in

771
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:49,360
because we can take it out. No way we can do this. In 30 years, our world could be ruled by one body,

772
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,440
or so. Oh, we're too late for that. Conglomerates are screaming too cr- Wait, let's turn-

773
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:02,240
Wait, I can't turn it off. Uh, what's a conglomerate? I've done another rabbit hole. The division has

774
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:07,760
already begun. Oh, I haven't long ago. Conglomerates are scheming. They're even trying to reduce the

775
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:13,840
world population to one billion. That's scary. I want to live in an equal society. I'll put it in

776
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:17,040
because it's super chat, but we'll see if we can replace it with something else. What would the

777
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,600
world be like ruled by one government? I don't know how I feel about worshiping a fallen angel,

778
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:27,760
being an angel myself. Lucifer, hold that guy. You can be my fo- You can be my fallen angel. Sorry,

779
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:34,720
this is a chat. Keep fricking doing it wrong. Uh, I'm already taking action. You frown your face

780
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:43,440
is so kawaii ne. Is there any mean comments? I don't think I've seen any mean comments.

781
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,680
Like, literally we're playing the Biden number Isaac right now. We've got, uh, biblical references.

782
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,080
I'm kind of curious about that kind of world. Okay, we'll put that in.

783
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:07,840
Wow. I assume if I don't, like, if I skip this, I miss out on, like, she might get stressed.

784
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:12,960
I'll have a peek at the comments. That's scary. I want to live in an equal society. Yeah,

785
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,640
but then just sitting around and complaining isn't going to change anything. We must fight.

786
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:23,440
No way we're fricking starting a revolution as an e-girl, please. Yes, you can, uh, I shall be the

787
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:32,480
new, I'll be the new god of this world. Yes! Oh my god. Yes. How do I make her do more of this?

788
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:40,800
This is amazing. Oh my god. Oh no, it makes her shaky though. Oh, I don't want her to be upset.

789
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,760
You know what we're doing? You're always bound to end up fighting one way or another.

790
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,680
Those who do not fight will not survive. Look at my DM and stop ignoring me.

791
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:57,600
I'm sorry. Where's your webcam? Oh, sorry. Oh, I thought I can head pattern.

792
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:03,040
Kind of. Obviously, the first thing you gotta check that you can touch next is the section,

793
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:09,200
but hey ho. Oh, I can't head pattern. Take that. Yeah, you like that. Yeah, head pattern. Okay.

794
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:14,480
I don't think I can talk to you right now. I've just been focusing on your career, so it's fine.

795
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:24,880
Alex Jones feature for art. I want her to, like, take over the world. I'm going to make

796
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,800
an Amazon wishlist. What should I put in it? Bath bomb costume and expensive mic.

797
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:35,200
I'll produce that. Expensive mic. The people need to hear your words. All right. That's it. Yes.

798
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:42,240
The people need to hear you. So not Kawaii. Oh my god. You're so Kawaii. Oh, she's blushing.

799
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:50,960
So not cute. Okay. Okay.

800
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:58,080
If this is you complaining about me not interacting with you, my lady,

801
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:02,400
I have to say this is the most rubbish interaction I've ever seen before.

802
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:08,160
We are sending each other emojis and that's it. You're done. How do I make you do that thing again?

803
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:14,160
How is, what was the one that made her get that row? I want her to do that row more.

804
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,600
Her stress, oh, her stress is 61? Oh, that's so high.

805
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,040
Her mental darkness goes up on social media. I don't want that.

806
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:34,640
Daisling stops call makes you feel as a streamer's voice is a lifeline, but it'll take too many

807
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:39,120
and or stuff will happen. Okay. Everything just feels more manageable and it makes you feel kind

808
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:48,320
of floaty. Do we pop one? Fuck it. We'll pop it. What happens to her stress levels?

809
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:59,920
Madame. Madame. Madame. You did not have to post that on the main account. So her stress went,

810
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:05,040
wait, that was it. The stress went down by one. That was pathetic. Don't ever do that again. That

811
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:14,400
was rubbish. Oh my God. She's high as a kite. You are in no state. Is this this jump scare here

812
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:23,440
as well? You're in no state to stream. Yeah, you're in no straight. That was useless. You're not looking

813
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:30,080
at my DMs as quickly as you used to. Do you care about my girlfriend? We got rent to make, honey.

814
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:36,400
Get them Yurizou. I love you, but get them Yurizou. What are you talking about? Right. How did I get

815
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:43,360
her to do that? Come on, become a politician. Go on social media. Oh, wait, I think you just put

816
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:49,280
her stress up more. I'm really bad at this game. It feels like everyone is low on age. Is it because

817
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,920
of something they did? Also, please remember the streamer people too. Oh my God, I see that tweet

818
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,400
like all the time. Honestly, this game's pretty meh. I have to admit, like, I don't know, tweets like.

819
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:05,680
But then, wait, so how do I progress? I want more of this one. Take a dive into conspiracy world.

820
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:12,800
I'm not allowed to do it. Or am I allowed to do it? No, I think it regurgitates the stream,

821
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:18,880
so you can't do that. The next idea for conspiracy is on internet video streaming.

822
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:25,920
Okay, let's do a throwback to a game. I needed her stress is getting pretty bad. We're over 50%.

823
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:33,840
We're at 56% stress levels. Oh, I didn't mean to skip that, but I did. Oopsies. You got a lot more

824
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:38,080
stream ideas. Hey, cuties, I'm fine. It's time for me to come. Nice never gets old.

825
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:46,160
As usual. We're going to check out some truly ancient artifacts today. Well, like Assassin's

826
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:52,960
Creed Brotherhood. Goodness, gravy. I love games. I'm excited. What games are you playing?

827
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:59,440
The chat would like to know. Hey, I'm just doing my algebra while listening to she's back.

828
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:06,800
It's such a good adaptation. See, this is so slow, but the next thing is so fast.

829
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:14,640
Can I make her gamers? Let's go. That's right. Gamers are the most pressed and play some flash games.

830
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,240
Oh, I don't even remember any flash games, to be honest.

831
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,920
Um, fancy pants. I think it's the only flash game I remember playing.

832
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,520
He had like a mohawk and it was just like a 2D.

833
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:35,760
You look like you suck at games. And you look like you swallow at games,

834
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:42,800
you nasty. Thanks for the five. Going to a rent. Don't know what's going on, but I like it. Yes.

835
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:49,840
As long as you're enjoying yourself. What a lovely freaking chat she's got already.

836
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,400
Although her design is like, wow, this takes me back. This

837
01:00:55,360 --> 01:01:02,560
site should be the one. Wait, huh? Don't TOS yourself. Don't TOS. What are you opening?

838
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:08,560
Are you all right? What's wrong? Oh, it's so old that support has ended and we can't play. Girl,

839
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:14,640
you're supposed to pre-open the game before string for this reason. Of course, literally.

840
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:22,320
That's actually in one of my rule books for the girls. I gave them a document and it said,

841
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:27,040
please open the game before stream to make sure you know it works and have backup games immediately.

842
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:31,600
Yep, there is folks. No, that was rude, I think. You're so silly. That's cute.

843
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,880
Lol, this is, this was more interesting actually. Okay, okay.

844
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,760
I literally, in the document, I'm like, please open. I'm like, don't cry.

845
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,360
Stop pandering to the old fucks on the internet.

846
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:52,640
Are we ages out here? Hold on a minute. I'm not. You're not reading that. That's not nice.

847
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:00,400
That's not nice. Or should I put it in there and then she'll address it?

848
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:05,280
Possibly. I'll put it in so she addresses it and she's like, we're not ages out here.

849
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,920
Like, we're just here having a good time, you know what I'm saying? It's okay, there's

850
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:13,760
all the same. You're lucky you're so pretty. You're lucky. No. Yeah, either you spawned in,

851
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,040
okay? You didn't pick the coordinates. You didn't pick what's going on. All right,

852
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:21,920
maybe I shouldn't have done that one. Oh, I don't know. Don't cry. Don't cry.

853
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:28,240
There are only three situations where it is appropriate for a woman to cry.

854
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:35,680
All right. When you get dumped, when you lose your wallet, and when your child's at Flash Games,

855
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:41,200
get discontinued. Sorry, I've got warrable if you can hear me rubbing that.

856
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,360
Stop entering to the old folks on the internet.

857
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:49,680
Shut up, my little lips. That's a cool way. It doesn't matter what age and gender.

858
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,080
Okay, yeah, she's sure I'm done. That's what I'm talking about.

859
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:57,200
So much for our first game stream. That's all for today, I guess.

860
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,880
Bless. Welcome to the house of Bless. Okay.

861
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:14,800
Well, that's it. What can you do? Things are only just getting started,

862
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:19,600
so I have to try even harder from now. Come on, I said stop ignoring me.

863
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:25,520
I'm 500 times more needed. Can I like like these so she knows I'm not ignoring her?

864
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:31,920
I don't know. My fiction 50. Our stress is so high.

865
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,520
We need to do something about that. We need to do something about our stress today.

866
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:43,760
I'm getting nervous. I'm getting shaky. Right. For your stress, go and...

867
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,000
Our stress goes way down.

868
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:56,400
And the fiction goes way up. But the thing is the stress goes down by like

869
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:03,520
what number difference is that? Eight? Whereas the stress goes down by six on that one.

870
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,560
I'm sorry, but a way... Oh wait, I need to talk to her. Sorry.

871
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:09,440
My new microphone's here. People have been calling about the sense, so this is really good.

872
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:15,040
Maybe I should take it with me to karaoke. Oh my god, yeah, I want to hear you sing,

873
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:23,120
baby girl. It's lovely time. Oh my god, you're so cute. I'm dead. This is so cute.

874
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:30,640
We'll be together in our next... Oh, are we doing afterlife? Yeah, yeah,

875
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:35,680
together in our afterlife. You believe in that stuff? Okay, right. To bed you go.

876
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:40,320
Go do your thing, baby girl. Let's get that stress level done, because I'm getting nervous.

877
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:51,600
I'm getting shaky. Wow, some... What's something you guys are really into these days? Minus the secret.

878
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:57,520
I love everything about... I feel like my brain's gonna leak out of my heat from

879
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:02,640
how good it feels. I'm gonna have... Right, we're at night. Wait, we're at night already?

880
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:07,360
Oh, for goodness sake. One day we'll be one of those couples that can afford to call a taxi

881
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:14,560
to go wherever we want. That is so specific. Yeah, oh my god, I would love that. Yeah.

882
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:24,480
I'm afraid you need to stream, but her stress is so high. I never even got her to get a new...

883
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:39,760
I never got... Are you sure you want to proceed? You'll miss out on streaming at night,

884
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:45,280
but I can't. I'm out of idea. Wait, she actually can't just do a zatsu off the top of her head.

885
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:53,360
Wait, what am I supposed to do? Am I to send her to bed? What's going on?

886
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,480
I already forgot what I told her to do. Is she doing something? Hold on, don't you?

887
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:08,320
What are you... What are you doing? Are you doing something? Is she doing something?

888
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,720
You can give her head parts. Okay. Oh, wow, I didn't know that.

889
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:21,920
What on earth? I'm kind of tired. Thanks for always being so nice to me. Yeah.

890
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:29,520
I should carry on your spirit and be nice to my little nerds every once in a while. Okay.

891
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,800
How do I reduce your stress?

892
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:44,320
Sexy stream. Her first ASMR stream. Let's go. Go to tomorrow. So we can't do anything because

893
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:50,480
we're like out of time. Can I like head pattern until like some of the stats go down?

894
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:55,760
I think she's doing something. Honestly, I was like, what's going on? Oh,

895
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,480
we're on day seven. Rent's due soon. Hey, what color should I paint my nails?

896
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:07,360
Light blue, purple, rainbow, black. I want to say purple because of her hair streaks and

897
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:13,680
her alternative outfit. Light blue and red for her actual natural self though.

898
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:22,080
Light blue matches her natural self more. I know black is like the thing,

899
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:26,960
but she is going to have to dress up for her stream. Oh, she's actually doing as I say.

900
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,920
You're actually such a good girl. You're so clever. Good girl.

901
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,960
I did my nails, aren't they pretty? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I was,

902
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,720
yeah, that's what I was thinking. Like, it kind of matches.

903
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:42,320
Gee, it's not even me that likes the color.

904
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:48,800
Well, a new black, uh, found a new girl. I like more than you. I mean, yeah,

905
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:52,320
you get new Oshis all the time. You're allowed a new Oshie. You don't have to say I've allowed

906
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:58,480
though. Um, you know, some, right, stress. Oh, forget to sleep.

907
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,240
If she sleeps, sleep until tomorrow. A new idea if I sleep until tomorrow.

908
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,560
Okay, I'm just going to send her a bed. We have an ASMR stream plan for tonight.

909
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:18,400
She's going to sleep. Okay. She's going to sleep. Let her sleep. Right. ASMR time.

910
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:25,520
Get the mic out. Get licking it, young lady. Okay. Did I make myself clear? I want to get high.

911
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:30,560
Oh, I don't think we, I don't think we're allowed to condone that. Sorry, but no,

912
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,640
you're about to do an ASMR stream and we need to make sure it's YouTube terms of service safe.

913
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:40,400
Okay. So no, you're not allowed. Go do ASMR right now.

914
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:44,400
Oh, hold on.

915
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,680
I forgot to get a new warble.

916
01:08:53,440 --> 01:09:01,520
Subsquibble. Any subscribers? First time. Hi cuties. I hope all of you nerds are going through it

917
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:12,080
today too. Going through it. Like the Mr. K is the always best. I want to die. Whoa.

918
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I don't think I can allow that. Sorry. I have put my hand over my mouth and shock

919
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,200
because I didn't want to, like, I'm not a nerd. But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but,

920
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:33,920
but you're so good for always trying so hard. It's okay if you're chocolate.

921
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,840
Honestly, actually, I'm starting to agree. We're hold on a minute. She's actually kind of starting

922
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:44,880
to make sense. Like, sorry, but you actually have been told by the capitalist COGS that you

923
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,560
needs to be productive for every, here comes the most job or something. What? Eh.

924
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:52,240
You have been told that you need to be productive for every second of your life,

925
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,360
That's not true. You try harder than any of us

926
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:06,000
But personally I hate being told that just being alive is enough. It's just such an empty ass compliment

927
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:10,660
No, sorry, I'm disagreeing. Hold on a minute. Okay, Angel

928
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:16,400
You're starting to lose it get back on the politician bandwagon. I want you to take over earth right now

929
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,840
I feel that tell him I feel worse now

930
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:26,680
No, I feel like that's cathart. Is it car thorntic if someone like kind of just gets to vent and chat

931
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,440
I feel like that'll put her stress up though

932
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:35,200
But it's like cathartic to like put it out there to be like, you know what I'm feeling it, you know

933
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,480
Here we go, what is it?

934
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,880
Yo

935
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:49,440
I'll be your team yell. I'll be your team yell

936
01:10:53,560 --> 01:11:03,200
Or smooch smooch is that what I'm supposed to say? I don't know what smooch you're my real life angel

937
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,680
Love

938
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,880
May that's what keep hanged off

939
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,440
I need stop I need stop. Can you take it off?

940
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:29,800
Yeah, we're gonna reduce that I give it a plus with my first kiss

941
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:35,160
I'm so happy then die

942
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:42,440
Thank you for the tip, but no, I'm not gonna

943
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:47,280
This pandering feels forced. It's weird. Is that gonna stress her out?

944
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:57,840
I think I think cuz we know she's role-playing it will thank you for this. Okay. That's much nicer. I

945
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:04,740
Don't want her to get stressed out cuz I'm already like struggling with her stress at the moment

946
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,160
She looks like Monka

947
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,800
Do it again, please. Oh, you're too cute

948
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,840
Yes, we're actually I don't know if we're gonna make rent. I'm gonna make you my girlfriend

949
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:28,280
This is oh, I always send the girls these like little symbols all the time in my messages and they're just

950
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,960
My little

951
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:38,440
Love love love and thank you for the super chat, too. I love a man who can send me both love and money

952
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:44,200
And thank you guys for you and I'll thank you guys for you

953
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:57,040
Why did why did you say that are you squidding me right now? Why did you say that?

954
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,920
They're all a thank-you kiss from you more

955
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:05,260
Why did she say that at the end of the stream?

956
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:09,680
Why would you say go die at the end of a super chat?

957
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,520
Whoa, I

958
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:20,520
Was so confused why she randomly came over that did you see he he did you all like what you saw the date?

959
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:27,160
If you did, let's play again tomorrow. What did some basic as pandering in my stats or skyro?

960
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:32,160
Oh, wow, I actually did our stress is so high after that

961
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,480
But the longest we around is a short sweet home right? I can't just ignore the girls

962
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,360
When you Twitter, I missed it. You guys are having

963
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,040
Overwhelming

964
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:54,240
Is that the end you need a head part

965
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:05,520
Is there a secret to the stress level thing I think I'm not achieving whatever it is. I don't want her to break I

966
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:12,480
Reach 10s. I want to do a celebration stream, but you know 10k is a nice number, but that's about it. Yeah, go for it

967
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:17,280
It's very I was actually speaking to the girls about this and the first step

968
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:21,360
I'm taking as a legendary angel, but I'm gonna get everyone to celebrate it and it takes back

969
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,240
You will love me for a little bit yandere. Yes, and

970
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:30,840
You have a new idea internet angel the internet and me thanks for taking okay that happened naturally

971
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,520
So I can fully de-stress her today without needing to come up with ideas

972
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,660
Wait, she's gonna get an idea for if I do this to her

973
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,880
It drops

974
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,280
Wait to gaming over she gets a new idea if I do this

975
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:52,120
I don't know what the thing is

976
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:56,440
Rest and touching grass like a real streamer stress management

977
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:01,040
Literally, we need to like take her out and go meet gammie. So she meets gammie things just even out, you know

978
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,080
Thank God they didn't introduce you to demonetizing

979
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:13,120
I'm not even monetized yet. They won't update my stats. She gets a new stream idea if I do this

980
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,320
And she doesn't if we do play

981
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,720
Internet it does her stress goes up exponentially

982
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,640
Mental darkness

983
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,560
Cine video streaming watch a movie

984
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:39,720
It takes her to dust you know what she's not actually sat and watch something. Oh, no, she's crying. Wait, you didn't want to watch that

985
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:42,360
I'm sorry. We'll be supposed to do something

986
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,360
I

987
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:51,040
I'm battling the channel page like the prison door screw monetize story

988
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:54,440
They just won't update this house. I don't know why like I can't the streaming site

989
01:15:54,440 --> 01:16:01,400
I use update no other anime does it like idle anime truly and the best ones are the kids idle anime

990
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,680
I'm glad you love it

991
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:09,880
Well, I guess that's why the page of the TV is the best though, right for any TV shows

992
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:13,120
Really good inspiration for my streams. If there's anything you guys would like me to do

993
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:16,240
Let me know in the reply. So maybe I could do something that we can only have someone

994
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:23,560
A girl's idle journey and a kid's anime. Okay. Okay. Okay. Shake it off

995
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,280
stress is still faking high

996
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:34,920
I'll miss yeah, I'll miss stream if I do that

997
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,920
Is there an internet I

998
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:43,020
Only puts it down by four, but it gives her another this doesn't do anything

999
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:52,320
That puts her stress down by four and gives her a new news stream idea

1000
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:58,600
That takes her to the next day now, I think we're just gonna have to do spend time together and put fictional

1001
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:05,640
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Apparently with this credit card thing. We can no no no no credit cards are bad

1002
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:08,040
They're not real credit. No

1003
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:12,000
Don't know punch you. I don't care. You can beat me up and spit in my mouth

1004
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:18,160
Do whatever you want you will not know peace. Oh my god. That's literally what I'm asking for. I love it

1005
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,880
I love you so much. Oh my god. You just read my mind. Oh

1006
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,280
It says read when she reads it. Well, that's kind of scary, right? Well

1007
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,560
A faction goes up during game gamer girl goes up

1008
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:40,120
Experience was up. Ah, maybe does make stress 67. That's better

1009
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:48,000
Are we going for the end? I don't know what endings are I'm gonna play the game before click anywhere to give her that's more

1010
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:52,040
Spend the whole day laser run. Oh wait, did I just skip stream? Oh

1011
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,360
No, maybe

1012
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:01,320
No, no, it's time to stream. Okay, my apologies. Um

1013
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:09,280
Let's celebrate your 10k milestone cuz that's fantastic as I was saying before I got interrupted by my own thoughts

1014
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:16,520
I actually said to the girls like unfortunately, like you kind of have to like celebrate numbers as they come through to like make

1015
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,600
VTuber news or whatever and

1016
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,440
Like it's really not I don't like playing that game

1017
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:25,680
But you do have to play that angle as a VTuber and it's like a bit like

1018
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:32,120
You got to do what you gotta do. Hi, here we go. Thank you. It's me

1019
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:36,120
Wait, you're not reading comments for the stream

1020
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:46,960
This stream is one to celebrate celebrate. What do you ask? Well, did you not read the title?

1021
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:52,280
I can't do anything

1022
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,680
I

1023
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,240
Guess just get ahead of

1024
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:21,240
I

1025
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:27,000
Never just watch everyone subscribe we need to blow up

1026
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,240
Celebrate with some tasty

1027
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:37,680
I can't be the best, you know, I really hated adults adults girl are new 18 plus

1028
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,840
I'm getting nervous

1029
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,120
I'm good. So I'm good sway. What's going on here?

1030
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,040
But they were all true to themselves

1031
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,280
Why do I find you being a dropout cute?

1032
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:59,440
They weren't ashamed of being into anime or manga. They were so free so natural

1033
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:06,080
My god to myself I want to live like that. I want to live on the internet and be my drizzle

1034
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:10,320
I guess I wasn't too interested, but I'm glad I could share with you guys. What's that?

1035
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:15,080
You talk too fast for me when I put you on this mode. Jeez the stream is already over and do a dang thing

1036
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,200
Hello

1037
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,640
Look I draw some fan art. Oh, that's so cool

1038
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,400
That's so cool

1039
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,280
Getting fan or it's honestly crazy

1040
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,400
Oh

1041
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:45,280
Can I like save it or send it to her so she can see it just so she knows

1042
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,760
Oh the nighttime trims actually really nice it reminds me of that Russian song that goes

1043
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,160
She's 17

1044
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:09,320
Oh, am I ignoring her DMs again? How do I ignore them by accident? I'm sorry. I love you. Please. I'm sorry

1045
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,760
You get an achievement for like clicking her head a hundred times in the rope

1046
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,720
Okay, that's as fast as I can click if I didn't make her happy I don't know what was

1047
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,880
I can't I can hear that in the chin

1048
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Shit wait, she's actually 17

1049
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,760
I

1050
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:39,040
Very strongly think that any content career should be at least 18 years old

1051
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:48,720
Sponsorships trying it in your drinks. I got dea. Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh my god. That's amazing. Oh my god

1052
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:54,600
Love you. Oh my god. You're so cool. She's gonna know I haven't are you sure? Yeah. Yeah, this I'm so sure

1053
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,520
Wait, what did she ask I didn't pay attention

1054
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:02,680
I got dm'd about the sponsorship sponsorship as we enter in the big leaves

1055
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:05,280
Let's see what it says. Uh, we'd like for you to review of our new

1056
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:10,520
Natto wait Natto is that fermented soybeans?

1057
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:15,480
Flavored cola and they said they'll pay me a year's supply. No

1058
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:23,800
You have to accept US dollars for payment. You do not ever ever entertain a sponsorship

1059
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:27,640
That say we'll pay you with our product. No

1060
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:33,120
Hard-earned cold cash. Do not entertain

1061
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:40,800
Respond reply. Okay, this is true. Yeah, why not a job's a job? No, we are not doing that stream

1062
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:44,920
Absolute waste of time. I'm going to send you

1063
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:51,000
To do that internet thing because I want you to become a politician but our stress goes up

1064
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Mmm

1065
01:22:55,320 --> 01:23:01,040
Her mental darkness goes up but her stress goes down. No, her affection goes down

1066
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:04,920
We will do

1067
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:13,960
Is is ST gonna give me the freaking politician angle. I want her to take over the world

1068
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,840
This takes me to dusk

1069
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,400
Congrats. I'll get monetized

1070
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,400
Why are they happy about that?

1071
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,240
So they can be her paper already down. I feel like

1072
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:31,000
Wait, what's this this bottom book post? Oh

1073
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:35,580
No, our stress goes up. No, we're doing that. You stress goes up. You go watch some cinema

1074
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:45,000
I've been streaming a lot of anime by myself, let me know in the replies if you have recommendation

1075
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:51,360
Lying around and watch an anime late late night anime is probably my favorite ever

1076
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,160
Maybe I'll talk about conspiracy. Yes

1077
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,280
Yes

1078
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:57,720
Yes

1079
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:03,160
Absolutely do it, but you know, I'm a little scared to know keep talking about it. You're gonna rule the world

1080
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,360
You will rule the world

1081
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:09,960
We you must you must I don't think I have to do it. No, you have to do it

1082
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:12,160
But I don't think I have to do

1083
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:19,800
Dwell too much on that. I'm plus I can't I guess believing in them is kind of like its own brand of happiness

1084
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,280
please

1085
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:28,160
But I think I'll talk about my crew for microchips next. Those are one of my favorite. Yes. Yes

1086
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:34,040
Your PC's can scan the layout of your house. Yes. I remember watching a talk show once in this guy

1087
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:36,160
He was talking about an urban legend and another guest

1088
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:41,040
So you got microchipped into you and then the guy was like I could tell you but then I'd have to kill you was the most

1089
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,600
They're pan-faced ever

1090
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:46,960
That was what made me look into this whole microchip business in the first place

1091
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,680
I guess I want to talk about it because of how plausible it is

1092
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:52,860
Yes

1093
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:55,560
Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes

1094
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,480
Yes, I was so happy I wanted to be like on conspiracy not

1095
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:05,340
I've been falling asleep with my eyes open. So if you see me doing that, please close your eyes

1096
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:08,000
Please close my eyes for me. What the heck?

1097
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,880
Yeah, I will

1098
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:18,000
Right, I just gonna de-stress her because we already know what she's gonna do

1099
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:22,760
Who's her stress up to post on social media, which is such a shame

1100
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,440
Mmm

1101
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,880
Video streaming seems like such a safe thing to make her like less stressed

1102
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:35,380
I'll do that and then we'll stream conspiracy theory. Oh

1103
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,560
Tiny spiny. Thank you for the tip. It's work time for me against Ronnie, but enjoy the game

1104
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,680
You'll probably offer and I'm done, but I'll catch up later. Yes. Thank you so much

1105
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:48,320
Unfortunately as a shorter stream, but yes have fun at work and thank you so very much for the kind tip

1106
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:55,040
Appreciate it. Um, I love videos where the person just talks about what they like even better if you learn something new from it

1107
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,040
Yes, agreed. I

1108
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:03,480
May be a dumb dumb with mental issues and a horrific academic record. Wait, hold on a minute

1109
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Hold on a minute. Oh

1110
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,840
And a bit too close home

1111
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:14,360
But I still want to share all the things I've turned up researching these things wait wait a minute

1112
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:17,120
Hold on a minute. She wants to do education streams

1113
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:21,840
Oh, wait a minute. Hold on hold on hold on

1114
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,760
I'm getting squirt mental Illinois

1115
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:28,200
I'm going to do a stream talking about things. I like and I like

1116
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:33,400
Am I darling little nerds like and to do that? I guess I'll have to start at the very beginning with nerds themselves

1117
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:36,520
And I've already done plenty of research on them. Let's do it

1118
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:44,120
Okay, why are these oh my god? Yeah, you're so smart for coming up with these ideas baby girls stuffy time

1119
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:47,120
I can't even see you. Oh my god. You're so cute head pat head pat

1120
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:52,840
Uh, right, okay, let's go to the night

1121
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,600
and

1122
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,960
The moment I get a single wrinkle. I think I'll end things. I

1123
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:04,280
She's hitting the wall. She's hitting the wall. Oh my god. I'm orb

1124
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,160
Is she okay? I like I feel like these are

1125
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:13,480
These are just like such random emotes like as long as she's happy. Where you even paying attention

1126
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:17,240
Yes, oh my god, you're so needed

1127
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:25,520
Right, let's do it or stress goes up so much talking about these though her mental darkness goes up

1128
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:32,880
But communication and rabbit hole go up so much though take a deep dive into the conspiracy of the world

1129
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,720
But don't go too deep

1130
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:40,360
But I want her to do it right. We're definitely gonna be on stress management, but

1131
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,840
We're doing wait. Yeah. Yeah, we're doing it

1132
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,480
She's fine. She's an orb

1133
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,520
She's Orbo death

1134
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:56,360
Wow, look at them nails. Hey, you changed your nails already. They're supposed to be blue like your hair color

1135
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,640
There's little things

1136
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,200
Subscribble on ear

1137
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:05,880
That's technology improves by leaps and bounds perhaps one day we will all be my car

1138
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,320
Oh wait turn it down, okay

1139
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:12,440
Oh

1140
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:15,960
Hey angel, hey, hello, hello

1141
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:21,320

Hi, hi, hi, hi, and you come and you come. What would her fan base?

1143
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:34,480
Hey angel fan base maybe if she's an angel and you follow an angel, I guess so you're a worshipper really

1144
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:41,840
Yeah, you're you just be fan name would be worshipper he goes, okay. Well, I can't yeah

1145
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:44,480
Yeah

1146
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:48,880
She's a streamer. She's needy and now we need to the overload of we can roll credits

1147
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:52,920
Their name is nerds. That's what she said. Oh, okay. Okay

1148
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,880
November

1149
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:58,440
See it's so slow if you don't

1150
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,120
It's literally so slow

1151
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:06,680
If I don't speed this up, but it's like far too fast. I don't know. Maybe my things buggy

1152
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:12,560
No, I don't know the game seems pretty like the game seems pretty put well together any clicker. No

1153
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:21,160
Nothing's happening imagine cities of people being controlled by microchips embedded from birth

1154
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,800
Going into the deep end. Yeah

1155
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,800
I

1156
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,640
Finally during work with work I can watch a game now

1157
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:38,160
We're doing the politician route question mark or the conspiracy not route concert. I see you're also enlightened

1158
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:41,800
Yeah, that's so scary. I got one of my arm. Whoa

1159
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,800
Whoa

1160
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:50,160
I've just noticed the music gets quieter when I tab over to do moderation stuff and then

1161
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,760
That's a really good detail

1162
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,880
I've got a microchip too. Oh

1163
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:04,800
Is she gonna I feel like that's gonna spur her on to do more microchip to do more of these types of streams

1164
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,440
another government conspiracy

1165
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:10,640
Wait until you learn about that time

1166
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:17,600
The ruling class could manipulate our brainwaves as we like we don't use our puppets. Oh my god

1167
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,040
I don't want to be main controlled

1168
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,840
No way you mean I could be brainwashed right now

1169
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,200
Where's my tin foil hat exactly

1170
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:44,080
We're going to be the tin foil hat gang. Maybe just maybe we already have those chips in our arms

1171
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:49,440
You could not be suggesting such a thing my innocent vtuber

1172
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,960
Idol angel k angel

1173
01:30:54,880 --> 01:31:00,960
Was that a scream how did you find out about this? Yeah, take that instead of the microchip thing

1174
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:09,680
And the moment you act out of line some big shot could hit you or kill switch from god knows where

1175
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:14,960
We'll be living under a dictatorship soon mark my words

1176
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,800
We are all on a watch list right now

1177
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:26,800
K angel branded tin foil heart hat marriage win honestly, I'm not going to be able to sleep after this

1178
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,520
I don't know who crafted it, but

1179
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:36,480
As if that technology could exist

1180
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,600
relax people

1181
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,480
Thank god

1182
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:49,840
It's trying to cut those branded tin foil literally just get tin foil the cupboard that was that was scary

1183
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:58,160
For now anyway, oh her eyes are starting to change am I noticing that?

1184
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,360
I'm actually gonna leave that one

1185
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:07,280
I'll leave the dystopia one

1186
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:12,320
But yeah, but her eye her eyes changing or if I just made that up

1187
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:18,400
Please talk about this forever k angel. She's going. Oh my god. I'm loving this right

1188
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:27,760
It's the music going up because she's going this rick. I don't remember you're not like the other girls. Yeah, she ain't

1189
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:32,480
I'm gonna make sure of it. I feel like I'm gonna fall really hard for k

1190
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:39,680
Oh

1191
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:49,120
That click mouse button sounds like the legend of zelda minish cap raindrop splits or slime droplets. Let's have a look see

1192
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:53,520
I don't want to be mind controlled

1193
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:04,400
Scary isn't it? It'd be scary if we were real though. How did you find out about this?

1194
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:14,560
Um, why do you ask am I being interrogated the government must have sent you to kill me wait girl

1195
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:19,360
Bless amen amen in the charts

1196
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:23,760
Why are you guys saying bless or whatever it's because we're a cult though

1197
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,280
Bless we're called blessed

1198
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:35,760
Literally get them hand emojis out there bless couldn't come up with a better greeting greeting. We're about to be out. The call is forming

1199
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,280
Oh

1200
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:51,680
I should really like a scream being incorporated into the music. Oh, look at your bless. Would you

1201
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:54,720
She did it. We do have to maintain

1202
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:59,040
Help me the microchip of my arm is controlling what I post uh

1203
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:04,880
Microchips are like whatever because even without them you still can't prove that we actually have free will

1204
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:09,280
Oh, she's at breaking point. She's at breaking point. Definitely

1205
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:13,360
De-stressed day today. Hello pumpkin spice

1206
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:19,520
I believe this is the biggest de-stress or I can do to you right now. It does take me all the way

1207
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:27,280
If we miss a day of streaming it takes it to 65 or if we do that it's 71. Oh, it's still quite high

1208
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,960
I don't want her on edge though

1209
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:33,760
Oh

1210
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:39,840
These didn't do anything if she takes the third one it gives her an idea like a psychedelic

1211
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,920
No, right we'll do

1212
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:51,440
We'll just do this. I know it takes us tonight, but I really want her to do

1213
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,160
Uh

1214
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:57,840
Oh, I keep ignoring her messages. I'm sorry. I keep forgetting. I'm so sweet like

01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:04,320
I'm so I'm like, I'm I'm super like manager in this right now. I'm not like vtuber

1216
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:08,720
Manager groomer. I'm like proper manager. Like I'm gonna make you successful

1217
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:12,640
I get some blue DMs from guys some oh my god me too

1218
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,120
on marshmallow

1219
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:17,120
Don't think I haven't been seeing what I've been getting

1220
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:22,560
But let me let me just say that this is not okay. I mean everyone's like wait what?

1221
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,160
But that's the best part

1222
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:28,640
Okay, we're doing ASMR

1223
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:32,160
I never thought about doing it in my k angel outfit for proud

1224
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:33,920
I wait

1225
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:37,840
Ah wait my clothes are finding crumpled. Do you think that'll be fine to go on camera?

1226
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:45,760
Oh well if I exit, please. Oh, wait. No, this is a regular. Oh well if I sit on the fascia. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

1227
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,520
I mean

1228
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,520
I mean true

1229
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,000
But like you do get suspended a little head pat because you're

1230
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:59,360
Here's a good flag. You're my good flag, aren't you?

1231
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Oh, here's my good flag

1232
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:03,680
Not click bleep

1233
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,040
Not click bleep

1234
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:07,040
Not click bleep

1235
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,600
Nocta can't lick

1236
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:14,400
Jesus lying down and it's a super comfy

1237
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,600
I think I need to get a water and a cola

1238
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:22,560
I can't the words are mashing together and now I can't get up. Come please help me. Yes

1239
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:28,880
I'm freaking I would think I would get a cola and a water unironically

1240
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,080
The words start mashing together if I read for too long

1241
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:40,080
Our stress goes round and round. Is there any stream that doesn't put your stress up? Like I don't feel stressed when I stream. Is that bad?

1242
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:44,720
Do we have to skip honestly? Do we have to skip?

1243
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:52,320
I think we skip and do ASMR tomorrow

1244
01:36:54,560 --> 01:37:00,240
Um, no, not the medication. I don't think that's a good route for you darling because if you start relying on it

1245
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:03,040
67 to watch

1246
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,480
something

1247
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:09,520
65 to play together or

1248
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:14,480
59

1249
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,240
59

1250
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:18,960
Yeah, no stream. We'll do ASMR tomorrow. No stream

1251
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,400
Let her take a day off. Yes

1252
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:26,080
Can't really I stream every single day. So I'm not really sure what this is saying

1253
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:31,360
If I ever find my special someone I want to go to the amusement park with them

1254
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:36,720
We can scream to scream together. I scream together right the first rule. Why would you scream?

1255
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:43,760
Oh an amusement park. Sorry. I thought I meant a park park like that one in New York City or something

1256
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,760
I was like, why would you scream there?

1257
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:54,640
Uh, I made up a p-chan. I made up a p-chan and then things got a bit what wait you made up. We fell out

1258
01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:00,560
It's cut is she like super lovey and dovey

1259
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:09,200
Monetization oh she got monetization. Congrats. That's perfect. You're amazing

1260
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:14,640
Ignoring you. No, you're not. You're literally freaking sending me emojis

1261
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:18,800
Uh, we won't we won't get convict

1262
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:20,800
evicted because

1263
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:26,400
Those online nerds can pay for our rent. Jesus dodged a bullet there. I don't want to have us

1264
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:30,240
To stream out on the streets might I really need a cola

1265
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:35,120
I need a freaking I'm gonna go grab a cola in a war. I'll literally be a second. I'm like

1266
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,800
Oh my god, I can't there's so many words the word

1267
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,400
I don't know if you guys get this

1268
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:45,920
But if you read for too long, all the letters start merging together and it's like it's really hard to take a

1269
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:50,480
Like a context you of one heritage the actual word is

1270
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,120
Period I don't know how you do it. Maybe you're a bit different though

1271
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,800
And yes, I did just keep talking once I walked out there and probably didn't even hear me

1272
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:11,760
I got my cola in the war. I'm going to take a little sipping tin

1273
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:13,920
um

1274
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,920
Put my blanket around me again

1275
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:19,440
I'm actually wearing underwear today. I can't believe it

1276
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,680
It's a christmas miracle

1277
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:26,640
But I'm not wearing a hoodie. I've just got my my blanket like a like a poncho like a poncho

1278
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:36,160
These streams are always a blast to watch. Yeah, are you ready for the rabbit hole route ending?

1279
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:40,080
I actually kind of I'm interested to see what the other

1280
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:44,720
Endings are. I don't think I'm going to do the other ending

1281
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:48,960
So please don't get excited for a strapped in big long stream or anything like that. Um

1282
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:54,560
I think I will happily watch what the other endings look like. Um

1283
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:58,720
Let's take a little water sipping tin. Um, if you are

1284
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,840
Remaining seated, please do wiggle

1285
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:04,640
Move your foot up and down

1286
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:10,400
And if you feel your calf muscles flex, then that's good because that is helping the circulation in your legs

1287
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,800
Just do a few of those and then you're good to go

1288
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:19,680
See you later. Bye. Bye. Thanks for hanging. I appreciate it. Uh she be cotton bum 30 minutes

1289
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:24,480
She be cotton bum 30 minutes. I will redirect into her though. So don't worry about 30 minutes

1290
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,760
Hmm

1291
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,840
That's what you better wiggle

1292
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
We're increasing that blood circulation for you

1293
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:41,520
Wow, oh, I just realized I can't hear any game sound at all right now. Is it because did I tab out?

1294
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:50,560
No, I guess it's the end of the day. So to symbolize it's the end of the day the music stops. I was like, where is it?

1295
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:55,360
Uh, you know some things may be cliche but they're cliche for a reason like this

1296
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:58,400
Welcome home darling. Would you like to have dinner first or a bath or me?

1297
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:03,360
Uh, wait, is this because affection is so high?

1298
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:10,080
I think so

1299
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:19,280
The music is different as well and she's animated different. Okay. I like I like this kind of detail like these subtle things

1300
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:25,600
Oh, wow, I'm like appreciating this game

1301
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,840
Oh

1302
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

1303
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:36,800
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Did we just we were supposed to do any smart? I didn't

1304
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:41,520
Oh, no, she's gonna be crazy for me. She's gonna go freaking yandere

1305
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:47,120
Oh my god, I don't want her to go yandere. I need to like ignore her a little bit

1306
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:50,560
I don't want her to go yandere. I want her to go political decision

1307
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,520
I

1308
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:58,320
No, no, you have to you have to stream you have to stream

1309
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:03,200
Oh, no, I'm I'm I'm freaking I

1310
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,360
I

1311
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:08,240
Successfully gripped my feature for talent, but I didn't want to

1312
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Right go stream

1313
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:17,600
ASMR, please. Okay. It drops affection dramatically doing ASMR. That's good

1314
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:20,320
We'll do that

1315
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:28,480
Go be unafectionate for your freaking manager because that's highly inappropriate. She's like yandere on me. She's called mercy mode, aren't you?

1316
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:33,600
You're too good. I'm too good in this sheet. She can't suffering from success literally

1317
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:38,560
Wow

1318
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:43,680
Oh, her eyes are different. Am I going crazy or am I just making up that eyes are different?

1319
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:50,720
Hi cuties, is your favorite? Sorry. I just drank a cola. So it's your favorite internet angel, kangel

1320
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:59,200
I love you. Oh wait. No, it's a chat. I love you

1321
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,880
Okay, we can do super chats today. I can see it now

1322
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:11,920
Hey

1323
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:20,560
Get off what should we talk about today? Oh, I know I've got a bit of a trivia about the corned beef

1324
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:24,080
I ate yesterday. What are you talking about?

1325
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:29,600
Is this relevant to the ASMR is this relevant to the ASMR stream?

1326
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:34,240
I don't

1327
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:38,080
Oh, yeah, corned beef. I've never been so interested in corned beef before

1328
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,920
Wait, please talk every day about corned beef

1329
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:45,760
Okay, her chat's actually really funny. I'm I'm gonna give it to them

1330
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,800
Corned beef a smart literally

1331
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:54,000
Did you know that corned beef is shaped so because of old canning methods which would

1332
01:43:56,320 --> 01:44:00,880
Is her heart pounding? No

1333
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:08,240
Is her heart pounding because she's so in love at the moment

1334
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:18,320
Good stream, but that's all it was just good. Um, that's a backhanded comment. So we will remove it because that's not very pleasant

1335
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:27,280
Don't you be nervous? Does this thing have scenes? Does this game have scenes that I need to be nervous about?

1336
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:32,880
Does this game have scenes that need to be nervous about

1337
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:34,880
I

1338
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:37,360
Subbing for sure omega lull

1339
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:43,120

01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:48,960
I didn't know okay the game's safe. It's safe. Okay. Let's see. I didn't know if it was gonna go any further

1341
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,440
You've just got yourself a new fan

1342
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:58,560
I suppose I could give you a small oh

1343
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:03,600
My god, that's so me when the bikini freaking toggle came on and I'm just me when about typing like

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. This game this game

1346
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:16,160
Um, I know it's early days because we haven't finished our route, but I want to say this is 10 out of 10 already for me

1347
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:19,600
This game highly enjoying it highly

1348
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:25,680

1349
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:28,640
This is so good

1351
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:40,480
Thank you for spawning me in on the same timeline as you stream

1352
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:43,680
You just made me smile for the rest of my life

1353
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:50,400
I suppose that's a nicer compliment than I give you a reward

1354
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:55,200
But if she needs to pay rent and get more equipment because we got that microphone

1355
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:57,840
I will never forget this stream for as long as I live

1356
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:02,160
Don't worry. It's already been archived eight times over. You don't got worry

1357
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:05,360
Can you do a workout stream?

1358
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:10,560
Oh, is there like a fitness route? That would actually be kind of cool. You can like make her buff

1359
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:13,040
I feel like you're trying too hard

1360
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:18,640
You're out you will not hurt my streamers feelings

1361
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:22,800
Guess this makes you an arch angel for now. Oh

1362
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:24,960

Wait, wait, wait. Let me read that again. Guess that makes you an arch angel now

1364
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:40,160
Uh, oh that didn't work. Oh, no, does that work? No, I'm a freaking no my freaking thing doesn't work

01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:51,680
No, stop stop giving me money for something so small

01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:13,760
Oh

1371
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:19,520
Amy is such a fucking hard worker, you know, hold on hold on game game

1372
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:26,320
Did I accidentally go a little overboard? Uh, yeah, you're just popped it

1373
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:34,880
Uh, hmm. I got way better numbers showing a bit. I wonder how that worked 10. Hmm. I try it truly a mystery

1374
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:42,640
Uh, can I talk to oh wait, we got our goal. She wanted 100k. She did it. Wait, we want all ready. That's not right

1375
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:49,680
Did she not want 100k or

1376
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:54,000
This is my first time reaching so bad. I don't know what's gonna happen for you. I'm a bit nervous feeling

1377
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:58,320
She wanted a milk. Oh hen. That's greedy hen

1378
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:05,360
Hen you're supposed to take down the capitalist cog of greedness. Okay

1379
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:11,200
I need to thank them for their devotion. Yeah, I think she's gonna get yeah. Yeah, yeah

1380
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:19,680
Definitely do a thank you stream because that's like insane. What we will do is nothing affection wise

1381
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:23,200
Uh, definitely stress though

1382
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:29,600
Yeah, we'll just make her watch two videos in a row. I think who goes there identify yourself

1383
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:34,080
As long as affection doesn't go up

1384
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:37,360
Then

1385
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:42,000
I'm happy I was watching this idol video and they were all eating popsicles for some reason

1386
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:45,040
I already know where

1387
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:47,760
Oh

1388
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:49,520
ASMR

1389
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:54,640
Oh, she's wanting the ASMR route, but I'm wanting the different route. I don't know how to get the freaking politician

1390
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:57,120
I want the politician route

1391
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:58,880
Is she okay?

1392
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:04,640
You look so annoyed there. Here Jester asked me what I do and I I was like lol. I'm just a voice. That's what I was saying

1393
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:09,840
If someone ever makes small talk with me, I'm just like I'm just a voice actor

1394
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:13,360
It's so much easier to explain than be like

1395
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:18,160
Uh, I mean I'm an anime woman on das interwebs. Yeah

1396
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:21,440
I'm just like, oh, yeah

1397
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:28,720
The scottish voices and demand all the time, you know, I get to play big strong women in my audios

1398
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:32,400
Meanwhile, my audios are like, yeah take it. Oh

1399
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:37,360
Oh

1400
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:40,400
Can't she go outside for stress relief possibly

1401
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:43,200
I'm dead. That's so cute

1402
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:45,920
It's so cute. I'm dead

1403
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,640
So not cute. Oh my god, I'm so sorry

1404
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:54,000
Love forever. Did I just do that and then she's happy

1405
01:49:55,680 --> 01:50:01,120
Is she like talking to herself when she does that or is that a reflection on

1406
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:03,920
Um

1407
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:06,960
Right

1408
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:13,680
If I sleep until night her mental dark. Okay, so sleep gets rid of mental darkness. I think we will do that

1409
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:17,520
That's lovely. Yes. Just have a wee nap. Hey, you've deserved it. We rest

1410
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:21,520
Okay mental darkness

1411
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,680
I hate this

1412
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:25,680
shaky

1413
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:27,680
I wouldn't say

1414
01:50:27,680 --> 01:50:29,360
Are you okay?

1415
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:33,680
Why are you looking at me like that? I woke up on record time this morning. Please breathe this morning

1416
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:36,400
It's nighttime

1417
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:38,560
Selfie time

1418
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:40,720
You're such a girl honestly selfie time

1419
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:44,640
Wait, so why is that highlighted? Give me this

1420
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:49,280
How do I unlock this? Does it tell you how to progress or is it just it happens?

1421
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:52,400
I want rabbit holes so badly

1422
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:55,760
But don't go too deep

1423
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,400
No

1424
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:02,800
Right, we'll do thank you for 100k because that is

1425
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:09,360
Very special milestone to celebrate and it's fantastic. Just got a look around the ideals

1426
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:19,520
You have to find it. Oh, okay. I think conspiracies would be not in a video

1427
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:21,920
I

1428
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,800
Need to play that Russian song

1429
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:46,880
Don't politicians usually have high stress and high mental darkness

1430
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:50,960
I thought she said she wanted to become like some sort of

1431
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:55,520
Uh

1432
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:57,120
What socrates

1433
01:51:57,120 --> 01:52:02,480
I feel like a philosopher to rebuild a new world. I thought that's the kind of route that that angle took

1434
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:05,840
That's what I'm trying to get. Well, that's what I think anyway. I don't I don't actually know

1435
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,880
Because I was kind of like, oh, let's be anti Margaret Thatcher

1436
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:13,200
and like public in like the resources

1437
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:15,120
Of the

1438
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:18,240
Nation need to be in the hands of the public and all that kind of thing

1439
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:21,360
Yeah, yeah, I want to make her a god. Yes

1440
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:28,720
I want to create you've grown so much as an angel. Wow, that's your channel grows so fast. I

1441
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:35,520
I'm an angel that came down from earth from heaven to save everyone on the internet

1442
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:40,880
Default setting too strong. I feel like you've said something similar before

1443
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:45,600
Oh, I can't believe it. I can't believe streamer repeated one sentence

1444
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:51,520
We're not reading comments for this stream. Thank you for coming to bless us

1445
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:59,360
I like how she's uh, that's it's so gross down here. You should go back to heaven

1446
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:10,560
The internet is oversaturated with users and content that it's hard to tell what to believe in

1447
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:18,560
Yes, you should do more conspiracies whenever you whenever you feel lost. I want you to know that you can believe in me

1448
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:21,840
All right

1449
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:26,720
Save us my angel

1450
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:38,000
And the whole believers will be whoa, we're doing the rapture all believers will be saved you just need to have a little faith

1451
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:41,360
As the internet angel I will always be by your side

1452
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:50,080
I just says exactly like that one russian song

1453
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:57,200
Beginning of a coat coat coat coat coat give me a coat give me a coat. I won't call ending

1454
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:03,440
I'm so glad we got tinfoil foil hat merch. I wear all the time when I watch your streams k angel

1455
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:09,200
Whenever you feel the world mean is crushing you or when you're anxious or if you feel like you need to cry

1456
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:15,360
Just come on down to my channel and I'll be waiting here for you with a smile

1457
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:17,360
That's actually

1458
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:19,360
Really nice. I think that's a good sentiment

1459
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:24,320
Your smile is bright enough to illuminate the hearts of all 100 k of us

1460
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:27,520
She

1461
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,680
She don't say she I'm not gonna fail if I don't get her the numbers in time

1462
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:35,920
I'd like do you always get the numbers and it's like a unique ending whoever

1463
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:40,000
Strongly blessing us with ink in this universe

1464
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:42,640
This game gives Valhalla

1465
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:44,880
I've ever played that game

1466
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:47,040
Oh, is this simple?

1467
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:49,040
Uh

1468
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:51,040
Obviously

1469
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:54,320
I know what it feels like to have nothing and no one

1470
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:57,280
La la

1471
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:02,320
I skipped school a lot, so I didn't have any friends. Hold on. I don't like when she gets a bit real

1472
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:04,960
Only the people online cared about what I had to

1473
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:09,280
Fuck it up. I used to sit on xbox and skip school because uh, yeah, I had to have a rough time

1474
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:12,240
Let's just get out of that. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute

1475
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:16,720
Honestly, I feel like a lot of VTubers probably had a rough time socializing and like that's how

1476
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:20,640
They've got the internet culture like be a VTuber in the first place

1477
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:23,120
Or is she idle?

1478
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:25,280
She's not VTubers. She she's just idle

1479
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:29,600
I didn't need no angels had to go to school too

1480
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:36,000
Valhalla is a great experience. How many ever big game we game endurance game

1481
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:39,520
She's VTuber coded. I was gonna say

1482
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:49,920
Try and stay humble and try and stay humble. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. Uh, right can't relate to that part of it

1483
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:54,880
Anyway, uh, I also got my son out for being socially awkward. You could have messed up in the end

1484
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:57,600
Social awkward, yeah

1485
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:04,960
Did I ever tell you uh at my job? I actually didn't know it was polite to say good morning to people

1486
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:08,800
Like that's how so socially inept I was like I had to learn to say good morning

1487
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:12,800
Which is why I like saying good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon to you guys because like I'd like to

1488
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:18,480
Think that hopefully like you do get to learn things with me like overtime as long as you have faith in me

1489
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:20,480
I will find you within the darkness

1490
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:22,160
uh

1491
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:25,440
Yeah, like I literally didn't know I was like you say good morning to your cool workers

1492
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:30,400
Like a dumbass and I didn't know that that was like socializing and really common

1493
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:36,160
Guess that makes you an archangel now, haha. Oh, that's strange

1494
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:40,080
Or is it just to signify?

1495
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:42,480
Remember you're never alone

1496
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:46,400
Bless we are joining the call the bless call bless call bless call

1497
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:55,200
K angel having 20 concurrent 100k falls creepy part of the game, which is oh unbelievable unrealistic

1498
01:56:56,400 --> 01:57:00,800
I can't promise to save everyone because that would be a lie, but if there's just one person to be saved by my person

1499
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,800
can I would say it's worth

1500
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:04,960
Oh, she got fan art

1501
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:08,640
Oh, she's greeting. No, didn't cry we in

1502
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:12,080
Didn't you need to cry? Why don't you draw a cry in?

1503
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:15,920
Only time you're late to draw me crying is because

1504
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:18,160
uh

1505
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:21,280
I'm just so happy with that act we did previously

1506
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:29,040
If my still if my smile can grant soul salvation, then I will keep smiling for all the viewers on the

1507
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:34,320
Are we changing her personality as well to become a god?

1508
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:46,480
I can't uh play a game do q&a raid a gigantic turtle around shinjuku

1509
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:50,800
No, I want her to do the conspiracy theory

1510
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:55,040
Uh

1511
01:57:55,680 --> 01:58:00,400
None of these are conspiracy theory for later. Yeah, okay, okay

1512
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:04,960
I hate this wait did her stress go up there?

1513
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:15,120
Her affection's still too high for us she's like doing this weird thing

1514
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:21,040
How do I find do I find the idea here?

1515
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:26,960
I put your stress up her affection down and mental

1516
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:34,960
But maybe it'll give us the freaking I want the the freaking politician

1517
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:40,640
Oh

1518
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:42,640
I

1519
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:47,120
Just found out an author that I've like ever since I was kid watches was strange like a dream come true

1520
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:50,640
It's mostly these make me so glad but she mean I'm happy that one of my favorite was the most

1521
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:54,080
When I replied he was like do you want a video called the disappointment a fellow that

1522
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:58,960
I thought this is where I'll start for the mental who says that anymore, but conspiracy

1523
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:01,760
conspiracy, please

1524
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:03,840
Oh my god, what did you think?

1525
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:08,240
You ever get curious about what crazy things people have done online in the past

1526
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:10,400
I reckon I could turn my past crunch into content or something

1527
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:13,440
That's like watching your debut stream

1528
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:17,440
Like definitely vTubers watching their debut stream for the first time like over again

1529
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:20,960
Like since after a while has passed like I do agree like that's good content

1530
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:25,360
Uh, I wouldn't mind showing our mock streams if I wouldn't show the girls mock streams

1531
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:31,440
But my mock stream I actually did better in my second mock stream attempt than I did in my debut

1532
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:34,960
Um, and that's fact. I'm happy to show it earlier time

1533
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:38,800
It's a good idea, but uh to be honest, I just don't really want to do it

1534
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:42,800
Oh, I just make sure think and it makes people want to die, but the suffering is what makes it interesting

1535
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:45,440
So I guess I got uh being a streamer so hard

1536
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:48,080
girl

1537
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:51,360
Being a streamer

1538
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:53,360
I'm not putting you in any way

1539
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:58,640
But then again, maybe the stars have aligned for someone like me like I know it's not

1540
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:02,880
Can we not stream today day off day off day off? I need to boost off some steam. Sure

1541
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:12,400
Uh, right if you're genuinely not wanting a day off, that's fine with me. Um, I'm gonna drug you up and see if that

1542
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:18,080
Oh, she's gonna get so messed up

1543
02:00:20,240 --> 02:00:24,880
She's gonna get so messed up and it puts her mental darkness up to 32

1544
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:28,560
Are you sure?

1545
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:34,000
Yeah, like you wanted a break pass out on these drugs. Have a good time hen. Enjoy yourself

1546
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:37,520
Three milligrams of the azepam will not do this here

1547
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:46,640
Oh no, oh no, I thought you were gonna go to sleep

1548
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:01,840
More than the sweet release of death, I crave the sweet

1549
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:06,080
Sweet follow account, but still why is living so hard?

1550
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:09,840
I guess I'll pop a few pills before going live

1551
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:15,200
What

1552
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:19,280
Breakdown stream. No

1553
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:25,600
Get offline get a break. No, you're getting you're getting closed. You asked for a day off

1554
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:28,960
I gave you one and you give me breakdown stream

1555
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:35,680
Where when I woke up the sun was already set and I still feel so lazy after sleeping so much

1556
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:40,640
Can I just sleep forever? Uh, you're probably feeling what's known as the side effects. I'm sorry

1557
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:44,480
Can I just sleep forever rest for a turn eight? No

1558
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:49,840
Sure. Do you want to sleep again? That means I don't have to bother living in it

1559
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:52,320
Oh

1560
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:59,760
Is she off on her not I think I'm I think she may be off on her not

1561
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:13,040
Is she okay, I don't think we should have done that one. Oh she can go out

1562
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:15,520
Oh

1563
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:27,120
But who's freaking affection off wait akibata. Let's visit nerd culture popular with young people. Oh, this is actually really cool

1564
02:02:27,120 --> 02:02:29,120
So can we map?

1565

I have like hardly any responsibilities and I love it. I don't want any responsibility anymore

1731
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:37,760
Uh, right. Let me ensure

1732
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:42,160
That we successfully redirect into sheepsters

1740
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:22,160
campaign and

1741
02:16:22,240 --> 02:16:29,200
Or maybe six hour actually if I zoom through it. Um, and then our multiplayer game of this week is

1742
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:33,360
None other than old school runescape

1743
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:35,680
That'll be an endurance stream as well

1744
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:39,760
So you can pop in at any time if you want to make a fresh character you're more than welcome to

1745
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
I will tell you what world we are on

1746
02:16:42,080 --> 02:16:47,680
We will pick a server that is not populated so we can all fit in because i'm not sure how many old school

1747
02:16:48,240 --> 02:16:51,680
Runescapers there are I will be doing a fresh account myself

1748

1749
02:16:53,600 --> 02:16:56,480

1753
02:17:08,720 --> 02:17:12,880
