1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
It takes like 30 seconds for it to register going live, so I would say hi to VodReeflings or VodLings.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,640
Hi!

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,920
I accidentally...

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,420
Wait, what?

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,620
I don't know what's happening. It's like...

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,260
Are you selecting the wrong thing?

7
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,160
It's not letting me type in my own chat!

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,420
You've done it now.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,220
Am I banned from my own chat?

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,100
Hold on, let me go look at your chat as well.

11
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,160
I'm sorry, but you're being graduated live.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,160
I'm graduated live!

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,460
This is... we're doing it, imagine? Imagine a company did that?

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,220
They're just like, hey, I'm gonna have you collab with everybody and then like a manager and like a P&G shows up and they're like...

15
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,320
I'm sh... that must...

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,420
Sorry, you're gone.

17
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,120
I've seen it. That has to have happened behind the scenes.

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,020
And like, the VTuber's just been too polite to say anything about what happened.

19
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,060
I got signed up on my YouTube channel! I can't fucking comment on your stream!

20
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,360
What?!

21
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,520
Wait, I was like...

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,860
Oh!

23
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,720
I got signed up on my YouTube channel! I can't pin my fucking...

24
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,320
Is that what happened? Is that you got signed up on my YouTube?

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,620
Uh, hold on a minute.

26
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,280
What just happened?

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,580
It's a purge of violour. Hold on.

28
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,880
The second...

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,380
The second... I can't just hit the...

30
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,480
I can't...

31
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,080
Sorry.

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,380
The second account has been hit!

33
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,980
I was like... I was just trying to say it.

34
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,380
This is like a type of joke to her making an all day of days traffic?!

35
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,580
No! It's fine! She's fine! She started it!

36
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,840
I woke up, and the first thing she sends me is a freaking Skippity 9-11 meme!

37
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,940
I'm like, fuck me! What am I supposed to do with that?!

38
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,340
Ha ha ha!

39
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,140
Right. Okay.

40
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,640
Wait.

41
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,340
Hold on. I won't...

42
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,640
I'm still! It says error try again!

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,440
Okay, hold on. Hold on. I'm getting your YouTube password!

44
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,240
How?

45
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,480
I'm getting your YouTube password!

46
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,140
Sorry, Ken!

47
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,640
I can't talk in my own chat!

48
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,240
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm retrying...

49
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,500
No! Don't add me! Yeah! I've not even put down my fucking stream name yet!

50
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,000
I've not put down my stream name yet!

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So...

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,700
Am I live?

53
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,800
I'm live!

54
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,440
Yeah, you're live! I'm also live!

55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,100
Wait, I'm getting your YouTube password.

56
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,400
I'm hacking into the mainframe!

57
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,200
I can't even message on your channel!

58
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,300
No, no, no. It's because we've been signed up.

59
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,260
YouTube does this random thing as well.

60
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,660
Wait, how am I still streaming?

61
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,660
No, so you can be signed out on OBS that still let you in, if that makes sense?

62
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,760
Oh, okay.

63
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,300
But it's showing that I'm not signed out. I still have my thingy.

64
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,500
I mean...

65
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,660
What's happening?! Why can't I type in my chat?!

66
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,600
This is like an OBS type in your chat or on YouTube type in your chat?

67
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,400
YouTube type in my chat.

68
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Right. You've been signed out as well. You just need to refresh.

69
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,300
Okay, I give up. Sorry, guys. I cannot say hi.

70
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,400
No, no, no! She can't! I'm getting the password! I'm hacking the mainframe!

71
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,600
Hold on!

72
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:10,700
I was in a Left 4 Dead 2 DLC. I was talking about Vtube Studio, by the way, guys. Not that.

73
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,800
Okay, this one is huge.

74
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,100
How do I join your game?

75
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,900
For the love of God, do not show this on stream.

76
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,600
For the live of...

77
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Oh, wait. I'm going to spoiler it. There you go. Don't fucking show that on stream.

78
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,800
That's your password.

79
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,700
And then I'm deleting it once you're in.

80
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,700
You're now a standard moderator. I'm not even signed in!

81
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,200
I said I'm a standard moderator in your chat when I'm not signed in.

82
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,600
I can't believe it.

83
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,100
I've been up...

84
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,300
Signed out. Sinking is passed.

85
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,600
Good morning, Reflings and Harum. How's it going?

86
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,700
I don't know how we could have started any worse.

87
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,800
But we got there.

88
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,600
I'm in. Right, I'm in. I can chat.

89
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,100
Taste. Right, taste.

90
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,000
Wait, it still says error?

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,100
Oh, my God. Wait, did YouTube just shit the bed? YouTube...

92
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,700
I think YouTube might have just...

93
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,600
It's just really...

94
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,700
Hey, I just got recommended a clip.

95
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,600
Wait, what does that mean?

96
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,300
Clip?

97
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,800
No, clip. I was recommended a clip.

98
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,600
Oh, they're tipping me. Chat is actually broken.

99
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,800
They broke...

100
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,900
On stream snipe fucking day.

101
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,500
Why, YouTube? Why do you...

102
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,100
I can't start chatting over tips.

103
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,700
Oh, my God.

104
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,000
Everybody sends a scent of a tip.

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,500
Okay, so chat's busted.

106
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,400
Don't worry, Reflings and Harum, if you're typing,

107
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,600
we are now aware that chat's busted.

108
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,100
Hold on, let me open up Marshmallows.

109
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,800
I'm sure it's just filled with Reflings being like,

110
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,200
Oh, I can't do it.

111
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,300
Oh, it's out on you.

112
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,800
Mommy, I think YouTube chat is broken.

113
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,900
I can't chat or see it updating.

114
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,800
YouTube chat is completely broken.

115
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,400
I guess you're just going to have to stream snipe us

116
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,000
so we can talk then.

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,400
You need to give a live commentary on the stream in-game, okay?

118
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,500
I'm so bummed right now.

119
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,300
Why would it break today?

120
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,000
That's so...

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,700
Yeah, because the last one is people just saying hi.

122
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah, it broke like right before we...

123
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:22,800
I'm going to...

124
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,400
Hold on, is it...

125
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,500
Let me just turn this into a Zatsu.

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,300
Let me look on Twitter.

127
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,000
You want to do an interrogation?

128
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,800
We get Reflings and Harum in on stream

129
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,500
when we interrogate them to prove their love.

130
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,300
We make references to streams

131
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,100
and if they haven't watched them, they get kicked out.

132
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,700
Who's that you're?

133
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,300
Wait, it's called a fakeling.

134
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,300
If you can't watch every millisecond

135
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,300
that of content I produce, you're called a fakeling.

136
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,000
A fakeling?

137
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,800
You're called a harlot derogatory for me.

138
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,400
Derogatory!

139
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,000
Ah, you had it here.

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You had it here first, not to hear them spank spank.

141
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,900
I'm just going to tweet.

142
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,400
Did YouTube just break?

143
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,500
I think so.

144
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,900
Did you order that Ethernet cable, by the way?

145
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,400
I did.

146
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,900
I did immediately after.

147
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,000
Right.

148
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,500
The next thing I'm supposed to get you to download

149
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,200
which apparently you don't have, U-Block.

150
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,000
You don't have U-Block?

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,800
What is U-Block?

152
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,400
It blocks a lot of piss.

153
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
We are stuffed cries.

154
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
My TTS is going crazy

155
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,800
because everyone's like, we can't speak.

156
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,500
We bane.

157
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,600
It's okay, Harrow.

158
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,000
It's okay.

159
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,300
It's okay, Harrow.

160
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,800
You haven't been silenced, guys.

161
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,300
I promise we haven't.

162
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,500
I'm watching another show about a hurricane.

163
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,600
What?

164
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,900
And his chat seems fine.

165
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,800
Wow, this is terrible.

166
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,300
What?

167
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,100
Is it just us?

168
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,200
It's literally just us.

169
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,100
We've been targeted.

170
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,900
What?

171
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,400
They had to nerf or collab.

172
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,200
They knew it was too powerful.

173
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,800
I'm like super upset.

174
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,200
Wait, I'm going to go to somebody.

175
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,300
I'm going to go to an AC stream.

176
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,500
I was bursting in an AC chat.

177
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,100
How's it going?

178
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,900
I know.

179
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,500
Hold on, right?

180
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,600
Both of us in an AC chat.

181
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,300
Hello?

182
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,800
I'm going to open it.

183
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,200
No, it doesn't work.

184
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,800
Hi, Dolph.

185
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,600
Oh, my God.

186
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,700
I can't type in AC's chat either.

187
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,900
She must be like, oh, no.

188
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,100
There's no fairies aren't interested in this game.

189
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,900
And it's like, no, that's not the truth at all.

190
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,500
We're literally that scene in Interstellar.

191
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,700
Murph, come back, Murph.

192
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,800
I'm going to message it right now.

193
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,000
YouTube chat.

194
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,500
YouTube is going to want us.

195
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,400
Husky, thank you for the tip.

196
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,200
Relatively saying, mother, can you hear me?

197
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,300
Thank you for the tip.

198
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,500
Mama, no, thank you for the tip.

199
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,500
Everybody's shouting from the void.

200
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,700
Don't give me money.

201
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,500
Just use Marshmallow as free of charge.

202
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,300
Yeah, use Marshmallow.

203
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,700
I'll look at Marshmallow.

204
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,300
Emmy doesn't have an ad blocker either.

205
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,500
I don't have an ad blocker.

206
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,200
Do you guys enjoy suffering?

207
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,900
How do you watch content?

208
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:23,500
I just watch it on my TV because I have premium.

209
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,500
I usually watch YouTube on TV.

210
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
It's not just you guys.

211
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,000
I checked Kiara's stream from HoloLive in her chat.

212
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,500
It's so broken.

213
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,200
So it's that way.

214
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,300
Oh, my God, it's so hard.

215
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,400
It's a rogatory.

216
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,200
Cheating on VLOR?

217
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,000
Let me see if I'm going to go to Mozumies.

218
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,500
OK.

219
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,200
Hello, is your chat also broken?

220
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,500
Yeah, it is.

221
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,700
It depends how you want to do it.

222
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,500
We could still stream snipe.

223
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,700
It just means we don't know what's going on half the time.

224
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,200
Everybody here.

225
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,700
Mommy, I have no voice and I must thank.

226
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,600
I see Emmy's channel is back up.

227
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,800
Hey, why would you say that?

228
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,900
I don't know why you would say that.

229
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,800
Yeah, fucking cunt.

230
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,300
Yeah, that one.

231
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,500
That one didn't land, chief.

232
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,200
I'm going to be.

233
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,800
Wait.

234
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,300
What?

235
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,100
Is there a count?

236
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,500
Hold on.

237
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,600
Hold the fuck.

238
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,300
Wait, wait, wait.

239
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

240
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,500
Whoa, whoa.

241
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,600
Wait, hold on, hold on.

242
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,500
I'm going to have to go.

243
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,100
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

244
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,800
I'm so sorry.

245
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,700
I have to go for five minutes.

246
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,700
I'll be right back.

247
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,000
I need to delete some shit.

248
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,300
That doesn't make any sense.

249
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,600
That doesn't make any sense.

250
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,700
Okay, I take.

251
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,100
I'm sorry.

252
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,700
I called you a cunt.

253
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,300
You're amazing.

254
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,900
Oh, we're back.

255
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,700
We're back.

256
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,400
We're back.

257
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,500
Are we back back?

258
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,700
Are you squiddin' me right now?

259
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,700
We're back.

260
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,700
Give me broad chat back from the Void underscore glow.

261
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,700
I can't have to go back to my own chat

262
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
because I've been going to other people's chats.

263
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,700
That's just me and Serani just sitting here in the Void.

264
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,700
Guys.

265
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,700
Oh, thank God.

266
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,700
I'm so sorry.

267
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,700
I'm so sorry.

268
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,700
I'm so sorry.

269
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,700
I'm so sorry.

270
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,700
I'm so sorry.

271
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,700
I'm so sorry.

272
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
I'm so sorry.

273
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,700
Thank God.

274
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Just picture me pulling you close to my chest

275
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,700
and just swinging you around by your little feets.

276
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,700
Oh, my God.

277
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,700
That was actually low key.

278
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
I don't know why.

279
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,700
That was that was scary.

280
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,700
It's like you guys die for a second for me.

281
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,700
I'm not going to lie.

282
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,700
That that scared me for a good bit.

283
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,700
Um, that doesn't make any sense.

284
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,700
How did Emmys account come back?

285
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,700
Because I think

286
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,700
What?

287
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,700
They didn't even send an email.

288
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
I mean, Serani, we're just talking about it.

289
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,700
Oh, oh, this is going to make Emmys so happy.

290
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,700
Oh, we were sacrificed to the YouTube gods

291
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,700
and I believe it.

292
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,700
Wow.

293
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,700
I literally was about to have like a mini panic attack on stream.

294
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,700
That's none of you guys know how parasol shall be fucking are.

295
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,700
I guess I can bring back the fucking.

296
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,700
I don't know why I should have just kept that back on.

297
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,700
All right.

298
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,700
It's all right.

299
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,700
We're playing in reeflings and how do we are fine?

300
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,700
Here, let me let me bring a spoke both up.

301
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,700
Oh.

302
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,700
Okay.

303
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,700
I just.

304
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,700
Never mind.

305
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,700
I can't do that.

306
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,700
Oopsies.

307
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,700
Yeah.

308
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,700
We saw anything.

309
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,700
Emmys us.

310
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,700
She's been she's risen.

311
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,700
She has.

312
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,700
She is the second coming of the messiah.

313
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,700
The one that was promised.

314
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,700
You.

315
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,700
Put the cuttlefish down.

316
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,700
No, I like I like wiggling her around.

317
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,700
I wish I could pop her head off and I can stick her on a skateboard like I did.

318
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,700
Like I did with my head yesterday.

319
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,700
That would be fun.

320
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,700
Wasn't it?

321
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,700
And then we can both just have a little skate park together.

322
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
I think that'd be pretty neat.

323
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,700
Don't you think so, mummy?

324
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,700
Oh, yes.

325
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,700
I think so.

326
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,700
Very much so.

327
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,700
That'll be fucking great.

328
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,700
She be I can't believe you came up with that.

329
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,700
That was a really fucking spanking idea.

330
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,700
Yeah, she's helpless.

331
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
Oh, mom, I can't do a single thing.

332
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,700
Looks like I just got it, you know.

333
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,700
I'm eating her hair.

334
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,700
It's cotton candy flavored.

335
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,700
She's lollipop hair.

336
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,700
You know, the first time I saw her, Strani's model, I thought she was going to be candy themed.

337
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,700
Her hair is made of fiberglass.

338
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,700
Ow!

339
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,700
I don't think that's so spanking.

340
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,700
I don't know.

341
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,700
I couldn't think of anything.

342
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,700
YouTube probably did a system restore a week ago to every account that Gorban got restored because YouTube looked like crap.

343
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,700
Wait.

344
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,700
Wait.

345
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,700
I want to screenshot that and send it to Strani.

346
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,700
Did the people?

347
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,700
Dude.

348
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,700
That's just weird fucking timing then.

349
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,700
What spell did I see do?

350
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,700
I'm fucking shaken.

351
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,700
That's so weird.

352
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,700
Look at the message I just sent you.

353
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,700
I am shaking.

354
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,700
Wait.

355
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,700
Hold on.

356
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,700
What?

357
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,700
Sorry.

358
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,700
Sorry.

359
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,700
I can't say this.

360
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,700
I know.

361
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,700
We're going to disappear for a second, guys.

362
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,700

363
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,700
We'll be right back.

364
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,700
I love you both.

365
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,700
Okay, bye-bye.

366
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,700
Wait, where are you going?

367
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,700
No, wait, where are we going?

368
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,700

00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,700
Oh, you're muting?

370
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,700
Wait, hold on.

371
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,700
Let me mute this.

372
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,700
I was just like, imagine I'm one-sided.

373
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,700
Give me one second and I'm here.

374

Speaking of business.

396
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,700
shall we get right into the stream unterbone.

397
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,700
No.

398
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,700
Let's get right.

399
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,700
I

400
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,180
Can only it's weird, but I can only do it in the back of my throat. I can't roll my tongue

401
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,140
Like I could do that

402
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,860
You got an enlarged you feel like Maricely

403
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,340
Is that a thing she's Maricely said it to me

404
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,940
She's like I have an enlarged you feel and I was like I don't wear my fannies big too and she was like no

405
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,940
I'm not talking about that

406
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,940
I

407
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,040
Know strongy, that's a ball of a

408
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,080
Teasing by the way, I'm teasing before anyone says and that was a tease

409
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:41,320
Sometimes I can come out where joke. Okay, sometimes I can sometimes he's got she's got tea he okay

410
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,580
I can do it easy something same to same eight

411
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:50,500
Or the uninitiated harem on the uninitiated reflex I

412
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:57,900
I strongy cuttles have a steam account which you can stream snipe and add me on okay

413
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,420
the addition is

414
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:07,100
strongy snipes now if you don't have my POV up because you're on a she be side

415
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,100
I'm showing it on screen right now

416
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:17,460
But it's strongy snipes. So what the agenda nation is and I have pieces of paper if you've never done stream sniping

417
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,820
But with me before I have a piece of paper where I write down who's played with us

418
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,980
And who's not and we work on an honor system where you do not play if you have a chance to play

419
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:33,900
You do not join until we do the reuse system where we read you again. So the train continues. We continue to train you

420
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:44,900
So you can add me on this account the truth of the matter the fact of the matter is I have never played left for dead

421
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,980
Two before she be has so we're gonna play some campaign mode

422
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:55,100
And then I have been heavily heavily heavily recommended to play a game mode

423
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,340
Which is 4v4 zombies versus survivors?

424
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,180
and

425
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,180
So, yes

426
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,620
We're gonna. Oh, I didn't even know that was a game mode

427
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:11,700
Well, apparently it's the most popular thing and we can get six reflund in here a minute a time

428
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:18,700
And I've never played this game before I'm killing all of you. Just kidding. Oh, this is gonna be I'm gonna get my ass

429
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,580
Handed to me. This is this is Dom loss. I can't

430
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,220
This goes against my nature

431
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,300
Management you've been suspended

432
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,540
What?

433
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:38,580
No, it's like could you've been suspended because you're doing the opposite of your war or whatever. Oh, oh

434
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,460
I was like wait did somebody guess no, no, no, no, no, it's like

435
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,640
Pick up their arse about it. I'm like that gear

436
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:53,460
Let me I forgot to tweet out my stream. So well you get that sorted. I love to eat

437
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,980
What's push the talk? Hello?

438
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Hello, what is my talk fun?

439
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,820
You know, say pop use all of us

Yeah

441
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,420
Use voice communication

442
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:17,980
I tried I'll I'll catch us in the game anyway, right? So we can only play with

443
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:23,740
Play campaign place their corporate of campaign online. Am I hosting that? Do you want hype? No?

444
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:28,420
I don't know. I think you might host it because you all have the bear. Oh wait

445
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,660
I do you have the ethernet cable and yes or no, no, not yet. It won't be here

446
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,260
Better internet than you and I'm happy across the globe

447
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,260
Leave me alone. You also have all the account and stuff. So oh, yeah, dumb ass

448
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,900
Play online with friends

449
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,820
Search for game no create a new campaign. I'm a friend

450
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,300
difficulty

451
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,460
What's that? It's the first time I played the game before anyone starts chance. Right? And

452
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:01,520
Because I'm putting on expert mode. I should just lie and say this is my first

453
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,340
I

454
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,460
Just want to make sure you're aware of sprays might be smart to make sure that's disabled

455
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,540
Oh, are people gonna do like sprays and they're all just like no not the cod lobby sprays

456
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,500
Wait, you can like custom make your own spring. I didn't even know that

457
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:29,620
Right a fish server type official dedicated. I assume that's the one that doesn't show my IP

458
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,860
Hmm, please don't come to my house. I come to yours

459
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:43,700
Friends only game create lobby like this. How do I add strong? My account code strongy snipes

460
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,780
You're suspended

461
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:57,340
Somebody stop talking about suspensions. I can't handle it. I'm getting nervous. We don't have to use voice chat

462
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:03,380
No, you're not forced to use voice chat, but you can say hi if you want, right? Don't snipe the slots because she be needs to come in

463
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,220
Right, how'd I get you in?

464
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,980
Well, why don't you just hide your screen for a second and then I can join? Well, I

465
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,540
Don't think I don't like every one

466
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,020
Yeah, but

467
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:21,580
Did you get that kind of get the chats so I could see both chats? Oh

468
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:28,460
Oh, I never even thought about that. That's fucking genius. Hold on a minute. Yeah, she's all right. I

469
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:35,420
Got she is cooking. Let me open up her stream so I can read both channels at the same time

470
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:41,340
Okay, I got I need a third fucking display, but I don't have enough room. Um, you invited me

471
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,260
Sometimes

472
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,620
There I am

473
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:53,020
Are you in? Oh, hey, there's a see there's a harem in here. I knew someone would sneak in

474
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,780
Fuck sake, they were quick on it, right? So I need to write down your names now because you are

475
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,460
Ergen so in tip

476
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,580
Not Leviathan

477
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,820
Right and then not Leviathan and then I write down the name

478
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,940
So then on the honor system next time when it comes to people that can join right just start game

479
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,620
I guess

480
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,860
What's my push to talk one? I don't know

481
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,740
I need to change it. They can they just they can hear us delayed

482
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,540
Oh, my bgm is still playing in the background. I turned it on

483
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,100
Get off

484
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,580
While we were talking did I tell you you have a second background music technically

485
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,940
Is the first one the first one I got you came out

486
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,660
Not correct for you

487
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,220
Wait, no, what is it?

488
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,340
Uh, I see after stream if you want

489
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,020
Yeah, I don't know

490
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:57,340
I got it concepted. It was still based after sonic heroes, but I had whistling in it and it was like no no whistle

491
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,300
Uh, don't do that to me. So then I just completely got it read on to your current one

492
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,340
Uh, because it did not fit you at all

493
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,460
But that was on me because your design wasn't finished yet and I went ahead and ordered the background music

494
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,940
No, okay

495
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:22,540
I got an achievement if you're reading this achievement gave Newell has successfully what?

496
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:40,380
I'm a cool dude. Oh my god. Let's grab a break now and get the hell out of here. Yeah, that looks sensitive

497
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,740
Wait, this my sound is way too quiet and keep our heads. We can get out of this

498
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,700
Yeah, how does a talking game test? I don't know. Oh see

499
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,020
All right. Hey, I'm in refland who's like born. Can you hear me?

500
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,420
I can't

501
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,340
Wait, there's no aim down sight in this game. Hello. Oh, I hear you in game

502
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,980
How

503
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:14,060
No, you can't aim. No. Yeah, it's more source games. You just don't aim down. You just shoot

504
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,700
Me melee is wrong

505
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:21,660
No, no, this is all wrong. This can't be. Oh, we can hurt each other in game. Oh, yeah

506
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,380
Let's not be shooting each other people

507
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:29,980
Yeah, let's not be shooting ourselves. That's rude. You're a bald black man, shiny

508
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,940
This is actually the real me underneath. Um

509
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,860
Deep down inside. I'm a

510
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,860
Remind me of my father

511
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,420
Oh, where is melee? I'm going blind

512
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,180
Hey big man

513
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,620
Hey big man

514
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,220
Yeah, what was that?

515
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:57,020
Wait, is that a refland plot? No, that's in game. I can't find. Yeah, that was in game. I give up

516
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,940
It's push enemies away. Why would it be called push enemies away?

517
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,940
The achievement was for when Gabe Newell put a gnome on an actual rocket

518
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,700
Strati is papa's now I was not expecting the Strati face reveal

519
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,500
Thank you

520
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,860
Diego

521
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:19,660
John Omni, I thought you were fucking trolling. I'm so sorry. I genuinely thought you're trolling about that anything

522
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,660
You must forgive me melee weapon

523
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,860
Yes, apologies. Oh my god, we're playing Gmod

524
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:30,620
I made it, but this is it's it's not gmod. It's made in source

525
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:36,060
Pick up the the crowbar. It's gmod. It goes like like gmod

526
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:42,620

00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,500
No Peanuts sorry.

699
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,500
Peanuts.

700
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,500
Peanuts.

701
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,500
Peanuts.

702
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
Okay there we go.

703
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,500
I've wrote your names down.

704
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,500
Right hi.

705
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,500
I can get a second pistol.

706
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,500
Wait if you streamstape on the body you don't have-

707
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,500
You don't come in with full um-

708
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500
Do I have dual burritos the fuck?

709
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,500
Here he is.

710
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Okay hydration check.

711
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,500
I've been slurping.

712
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,500
I'm on that cooler grind I don't know about you but-

713
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,500
I'm sipping some lemonade.

714
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,500
Alright I'm ready to rumble.

715
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,500
I'm ready to-

716
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Thank you for your service Harlots.

717
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,500
Are you scared?

718
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,500
Do you guys talk?

719
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
Are you too scared to talk?

720
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
Alice.

721
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,500
Let's find out.

722
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,500
Let's find out.

723
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Hello bitches.

724
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,500
Hello.

725
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,500
They get-

726
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,500
Hi.

727
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,500
It's so intimidating.

728
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,500
Who's more intimidating?

729
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,500
Me or Stevie?

730
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,500
What do you think?

731
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,500
That's a great question.

732
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,500
I think we both have our traits that are-

733
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Intimidating.

734
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
Oh they see you!

735
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,500
They see you.

736
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500
You're more intimidating.

737
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,500
Me?

738
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,500
Yeah.

739
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,500
What?

740
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,500
Why am I more intimidating?

741
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,500
They're just saying that because they're racelings.

742
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,500
This is women in general.

743
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,500
And they're-

744
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,500
Women in gen-

745
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,500
Whoa!

746
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,500
What was that?

747
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,500
A hunter.

748
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,500
Yeah.

749
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,500
Yeah everyone says you.

750
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,500
Jeez!

751
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,500
What did Stevie do to you?

752
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,500
I'm terrifying.

753
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,500
Yeah.

754
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,500
Whoa!

755
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,500
What's that?

756
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,500
It's fat.

757
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,500
Oh.

758
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,500
What the hell just happened to me?

759
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,500
I saved.

760
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,500
I came.

761
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,500
I saw.

762
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,500
I saved.

763
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,500
Get adrenaline.

764
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,500
I praised the law.

765
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,500
I tick.

766
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,500
What's mine?

767
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,500
Then tick some more.

768
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,500
They said-

769
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,500
They said-

770
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,500
I had one person that said you.

771
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,500
I think it's because they're your reeflings.

772
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,500
And they may have watched me from time to time.

773
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,500
Wait.

774
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,500
Do harems seem mostly you?

775
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
Or do harems seem mostly me?

776
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,500
One of them said me.

777
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,500
And then one of them said you.

778
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,500
Who's more dominant?

779
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,500
Shibi or Azura?

780
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,500
I'd actually say Shibi.

781
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,500
Yeah.

782
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,500
I'd say me for that.

783
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,500
Azura definitely could be Dom when she wants you.

784
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,500
She can turn that on.

785
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,500
But she just doesn't.

786
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,500
Yeah.

787
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,500
Get a pipe bomb.

788
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,500
Fucking hell.

789
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,500
I'm afraid I've got some ancestry that doesn't let me pick up these kind of weapons.

790
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,500
But thank you for the offer.

791
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,500
What?

792
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,500
I'm part Irish.

793
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,500
What?

794
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
You're part Irish?

795
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,500
Hi.

796
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,500
My life is a lie?

797
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,500
No.

798
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,500
No, no, no.

799
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,500
So I'm born in Scotland.

800
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,500
Scottish parents.

801
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,500
But then it goes into Ireland.

802
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,500
Ireland because of the famine.

803
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,500
Migrant in Scotland.

804
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,500
It's quite common ancestry.

805
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
I think I'm like 10% Irish.

806
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,500
Fuck yeah.

807
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,500
Or like 15.

808
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,500
I'm a lot.

809
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,500
I have to find my ancestry thing.

810
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,500
Oh, you actually did it.

811
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,500
That would be really interesting to look at.

812
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,500
As long as you're looking for your name.

813
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,500
Yeah, because I'm a major mutt.

814
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,500
So I wanted to figure out why.

815
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,500
Oh, you're a mutt?

816
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,500
Oh, that's such a cute way to say it.

817
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,500
Oh, I see so much.

818
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,500
Yeah.

819
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,500
I'm a mongrel.

820
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,500
Are we mongrel?

821
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,500
Oh, we duck.

822
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,500
You're so cute.

823
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,500
Little pupper.

824
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,500
What is that?

825
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,500
A boomer.

826
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,500
Okay.

827
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,500
Okay, boomer.

828
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,500
Whatever you say.

829
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,500
Okay.

830
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,500
Boomer.

831
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,500
That's it.

832
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
When am I getting a shabby song cover?

833
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,500
I'm waiting.

834
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,500
I know.

835
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,500
I needed.

836
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,500
I was so strong.

837
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,500
I'm like, I can't do the song cover that I wanted to do.

838
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,500
It's too hard.

839
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,500
So I have to think of something else to do.

840
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:11,500
It's actually really hard to...

841
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,500
And ironically, before anyone was like, oh, doing a song cover must be easy.

842
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
It's actually not.

843
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,500
It's very hard to do it the way you want to do it.

844
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,500
And especially if you don't have any...

845
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

846
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,500
What did you do?

847
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,500
I kept shooting.

848
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:35,500
I killed the little leaper thing, but then I kept shooting the first time.

849
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,500
Oh, wait.

850
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,500
There must be a combination name of harem and weakling.

851
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,500
Pearling.

852
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,500
Hearling.

853
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,500
Harling.

854
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,500
Harling.

855
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,500
Reefum.

856
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,500
Reefum.

857
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,500
Reefum.

858
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,500
That sounds like a roofing people.

859
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,500
I'm a reef you so...

860
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:57,500
I'm a reefum this shithead of you.

861
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,500
A reef lot.

862
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,500
Rack.

863
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,500
Rack.

864
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,500
Unless you want to be picking your teeth up off the floor.

865
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,500
Unless you want to be...

866
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,500
Why do I just randomly have...

867
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,500
Can I throw this?

868
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,500
I thought I would explode.

869
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,500
A spitter.

870
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,500
Huck toa.

871
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,500
Oh, you made a joke yesterday about Huck toa.

872
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,500
It was really good.

873
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,500
I was like, until I get to you, I need to Huck to you.

874
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,500
Huck toa.

875
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,500
Like, you kept going and I was like...

876
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,500
If you don't Huck toa, I don't Huck toa.

877
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

878
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,500
I was like, damn, what lyrical genius.

879
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:38,500
Because I was writing short scripts while listening to Sheebie yesterday.

880
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:43,500
I may or may not popped up on her stream at one point and got a bit incoherent.

881
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,500
But...

882
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,500
Oh, I think that I'm...

883
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,500
You weren't incoherent.

884
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:53,500
I was doing a Sheepster's Donut on.

885
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,500
Like goals.

886
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,500
I was like implementing her goals because she sent me a screenshot of what she's up with here.

887
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:03,500
And I was like torturing ASMR and I'm like...

888
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,500
What?

889
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,500
What did I eat?

890
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,500
What?

891
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,500
I just didn't even know what it meant.

892
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,500
Like what it entailed.

893
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,500
So it's having a giggle.

894
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,500
It's having a big giggle about it.

895
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,500
And...

896
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,500
I must protect.

897
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,500
I must protect.

898
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,500
Protect.

899
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,500
Protect and attack.

900
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,500
Adrenaline.

901
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,500
Oh, you have.

902
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,500
Okay.

903
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,500
Cool, cool, cool.

904
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,500
Pintas, you might need adrenaline.

905
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,500
What?

906
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,500
Pintas?

907
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,500
Sorry.

908
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,500
I should probably heal myself.

909
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,500
Strony, your robot voice was so funny.

910
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,500
I love when Strony...

911
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:47,500
I was dying on the toilet laughing because it was just like robotic Scottish noises.

912
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,500
Reloading.

913
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,500
No, I killed the boomer.

914
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,500
Reloading.

915
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,500
We...

916
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,500
Strony...

917
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:58,500
I love when Strony said it's reefing tape and refilled all over the...

918
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,500
What?

919
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,500
Reloading.

920
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,500
That's how it be.

921
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,500
Strony's close.

922
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,500
Oh my god.

923
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,500
Oh, you startled the witch.

924
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,500
What is that?

925
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,500
What is that?

926
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,500
It's the witch killer.

927
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,500
Oh, that's awful.

928
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,500
Oh, I don't like that at all.

929
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,500
I was just shooting hands.

930
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,500
I promise, I promise.

931
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,500
I didn't know it was a witch.

932
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,500
I don't know what the witch does.

933
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,500
I honestly don't know what her thing is.

934
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,500
Someone says go hug the witch.

935
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:35,500
Hmm, I don't know what she does to you.

936
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,500
Someone's crying.

937
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,500
Jockey!

938
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,500
Jockey.

939
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,500
Golf club.

940
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:48,500
Oh, there's a dude behind us.

941
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,500
Where is he?

942
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,500
I can't shoot him.

943
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,500
If you shoot her, she rushes to you and ends the...

944
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,500
Oh, hold on.

945
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,500
I'm coming.

946
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,500
I'm coming.

947
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,500
I'm coming.

948
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,500
Easy, easy, easy.

949
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,500
I am going to die.

950
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,500
Got it.

951
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,500
Got it.

952
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,500
Thank you.

953
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,500
I'm in.

954
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,500
I didn't mean to shoot you.

955
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,500
I'm sorry.

956
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,500
Couch!

957
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,500
Don't shoot.

958
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,500
Well, it actually saves you, but please don't spray me with bills.

959
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,500
Okay, that is a reasonable request.

960
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,500
She gives time.

961
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,500
I like how the adrenaline is...

962
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,500
Looks like an EpiPen.

963
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,500
Because that's what an EpiPen technically is.

964
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,500
I think we're out.

965
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,500
A little cheeky injection here and there.

966
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,500
I'll go first because I'm close to death.

967
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,500
Use me as fodder.

968
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,500
No, no.

969
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,500
We want you alive.

970
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,500
She...

971
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,500
Careful what you wish for.

972
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:43,500
I didn't think you'd jump on me so fast.

973
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,500
Careful what you wish for.

974
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:51,500
You're in my life of fire, peanuts.

975
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,500
He's chugging them pills.

976
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,500
They've given you adrenaline to keep you alive.

977
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,500
Do not hug the witch.

978
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,500
She'll down you faster than you saying,

979
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,500
Oh, shit.

980
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,500
All right.

981
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,500
Oh, thank you.

982
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,500
So maybe I will hug you.

983
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,500
I'm out of bullets.

984
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,500
You got pistols?

985
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,500
No, I'm not.

986
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:18,500
Hey, I'm reloading.

987
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,500
I'll chop them up through this fence.

988
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,500
Her day kid here.

989
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,500
Whoa.

990
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,500
Whoa!

991
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,500
We have AKs.

992
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,500
Oh, I like them.

993
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,500
Yepy.

994
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,500
Oh, wait.

995
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,500
Yoink.

996
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,500
That's 12.

997
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,500
Oh, my God.

998
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,500
They went out on the guns.

999
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:43,500
We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.

1000
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,500
Yeah.

1001
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,500
I'll take the AK.

1002
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,500
Talk to the gun shop owner.

1003
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,500
Good morning.

1004
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,500
Welcome.

1005
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,500
There's a heal here.

1006
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,500
Oh, I'm being healed.

1007
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,500
Thank you.

1008
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:58,500
Poorly is keeping me alive.

1009
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,500
Let me grab another heal.

1010
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,500
Single hand.

1011
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,500
That's right.

1012
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,500
For once, you guys are the heal slots.

1013
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,500
Yeah, that's right.

1014
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,500
Yeah.

1015
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,500
You keep us up.

1016
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,500
This is what it feels like to be pampered.

1017
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,500
This never happens.

1018
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,500
What's that?

1019
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,500
Your target laser upgrade makes your weapon more accurate.

1020
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,500
Oh.

1021
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,500
Get to go in there.

1022
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,500
To get a laser sight?

1023
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,500
Yeah, you want a laser sight?

1024
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,500
It's back here.

1025
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,500
It's in here.

1026
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,500
I didn't see that there was a laser sight.

1027
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,500
It is just this little thing in the bulb right here.

1028
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,500
And then.

1029
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,500
This?

1030
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,500
Yeah.

1031
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,500
Oh.

1032
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,500
Apparently it gets more accurate.

1033
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,500
Okay.

1034
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,500
My ankles aren't good enough to jump off the balcony.

1035
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,500
Yeah, I don't recommend it.

1036
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,500
Talking for personal experience.

1037
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,500
Oh.

1038
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,500
Oh my God.

1039
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,500
I remember you.

1040
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,500
What?

1041
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,500
I don't...

1042
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,500
You walked the whole way around.

1043
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,500
Oh.

1044
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,500
Did I?

1045
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,500
Whoops.

1046
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,500
It's in.

1047
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,500
I just like came down there.

1048
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,500
I thought you could go over the hedge.

1049
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,500
Are you ready to fight the horde?

1050
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,500
Okay.

1051
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,500
I'm ready to fight the horses.

1052
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,500
Bring on the horses.

1053
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,500
The rogatory though.

1054
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,500
Behind your forward.

1055
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,500
Where?

1056
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,500
Retreat the cola inside.

1057
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,500
Not me though.

1058
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,500
No way.

1059
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,500
Okay.

1060
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,500
Okay.

1061
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,500
Are you in fire?

1062
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,500
Are you?

1063
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,500
Yeah.

1064
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,500
Don't worry about it.

1065
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,500
It's fine.

1066
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,500
I have health.

1067
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,500
I scored the cola delivery.

1068
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,500
What?

1069
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,500
How did I kill the jockey?

1070
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,500
Oh.

1071
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,500
This is my maltone.

1072
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,500
You put a maltone down in advance.

1073
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,500
Five hits.

1074
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,500
Cat.

1075
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,500
Food.

1076
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,500
My dispenser.

1077
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,500
My beloved.

1078
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,500
I love it.

1079
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:49,500
I love editing stuff for Sheevee because it'll just fucking go off randomly.

1080
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,500
I think I went off when I was recording something.

1081
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,500
No.

1082
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,500
Thanks for trailing stuff.

1083
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,500
Yeah.

1084
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,500
Sheevee recorded her doing this on like trailer.

1085
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,500
And it was like, sorry.

1086
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,500
Boomi was making noises in the background.

1087
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,500
Let me try that one again.

1088
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,500
And then it was like cat feeder thing goes off.

1089
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,500
All right.

1090
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,500
Sorry.

1091
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,500
Let me try that one again.

1092
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,500
I usually just edit all that out.

1093
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,500
I'm like, I'll leave it in.

1094
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,500
She'll get it.

1095
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,500
She'll get it off.

1096
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,500
I like doing it.

1097
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,500
I'm actually kind of sad that I'm not going to edit much anymore.

1098
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,500
But I really like.

1099
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,500
Whoa.

1100
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,500
I'm shooting.

1101
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,500
I need to aim though.

1102
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:32,500
Am I stuck?

1103
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,500
Oh, there's people all around me.

1104
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,500
All around me.

1105
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,500
All around me.

1106
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,500
Me are familiar faces.

1107
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,500
Four in all.

1108
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,500
Thank you.

1109
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,500
Reloading.

1110
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,500
Would you be done for college?

1111
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,500
Are you sick?

1112
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,500
Yeah, I would.

1113
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:53,500
That's why I was trying to have an FPS week because I was getting my FPS wraps up.

1114
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:57,500
You know, we can grab here and reach them from behind when we do that game.

1115
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,500
Oh, yeah.

1116
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,500
We can use the most body shields.

1117
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,500
Oh, yeah.

1118
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,500
Yeah.

1119
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,500
Yeah.

1120
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,500
Oh, what did you mean?

1121
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:09,500
When you grab them from behind, you have direct voice chat open.

1122
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,500
Like the microphone goes open to each other.

1123
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,500
Oh, yeah.

1124
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,500
Yeah.

1125
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,500
That's the body shield thing.

1126
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,500
Yeah.

1127
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,500
And then you can.

1128
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,500
Whoa.

1129
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,500
You can see like really inappropriate stuff.

1130
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,500
Like right into their ear holes.

1131
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:27,500
These stream snipers may be shy, but we'll get one that talks.

1132
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,500
I know it.

1133
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,500
One of you will talk.

1134
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,500
Don't you guys want to talk to us?

1135
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,500
Why don't you talk to me, Lane?

1136
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,500
Talk to me.

1137
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,500
They're scared.

1138
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,500
The one who's here.

1139
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,500
Am I really that intimidating?

1140
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:46,500
Who is that?

1141
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,500
Where did that come from?

1142
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,500
Who's there?

1143
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,500
I didn't.

1144
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,500
Who's there?

1145
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,500
There's someone.

1146
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,500
There's someone.

1147
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,500
Someone around.

1148
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,500
The weapons are like really strong.

1149
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,500
I like it.

1150
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,500
Like it feels like when I'm shooting, I'm actually doing stuff.

1151
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,500
Getting sad.

1152
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,500
The safe room.

1153
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,500
Okay.

1154
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,500
Thank you.

1155
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,500
Did it poorly just say something?

1156
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,500
I don't know.

1157
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,500
I never heard anything.

1158
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,500
I saw the like cat bubble thing.

1159
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,500
The picture of the stressed out dog.

1160
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,500
Who did the most damage to?

1161
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,500
Oh, look at you, Strani with your 409 just behind me.

1162
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,500
The AK is such a good weapon.

1163
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,500
What weapon are you using?

1164
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,500
I don't know what it's called.

1165
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,500
M16.

1166
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,500
The Pew Pew.

1167
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,500
Killed the most special infected.

1168
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:32,500
I'm like, hmm, there's something wiggling.

1169
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,500
Shoot, shoot.

1170
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,500
Thank you very much.

1171
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,500
Oh, scar.

1172
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,500
Yeah, it's a scar.

1173
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,500
Guys, leave me alone.

1174
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:42,500
I thought you were supposed to be the American.

1175
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,500
They could be American.

1176
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,500
I don't know.

1177
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,500
I got my nose is stuffy.

1178
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,500
I woke up from a nap.

1179
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,500
Yeah, that's true.

1180
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,500
My chat was there working.

1181
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,500
I have a headache.

1182
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,500
Give you some slack, guys.

1183
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,500
Thank you for the extended three month membership.

1184
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,500
Whoa.

1185
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,500
Right.

1186
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,500
Reflins, you're welcome to stream.

1187
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,500
Snape and from my friends list.

1188
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:10,500
You should be able to just see me and join game because there's no one in an

1189
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,500
XC.

1190
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,500
Sad cat.

1191
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,500
Thanks for the extended membership.

1192
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,500
I know I'm supposed to be in the middle of the club to do it, but I'm unprofessional.

1193
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,500
Okay.

1194
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,500
I don't give a shit.

1195
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,500
Yeah.

1196
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,500
Did you like, did you pin your friend code?

1197
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,500
I can't even talk it.

1198
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,500
Talk it.

1199
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,500
Okay.

1200
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,500
Nice English for one.

1201
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:33,500
I can't even, I don't know.

1202
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,500
I'll try again.

1203
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,500
I'll try again.

1204
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,500
Okay.

1205
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,500
You should be able to do it now.

1206
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,500
Okay.

1207
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,500
Stream.

1208
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,500
Steam.

1209
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,500
Set team.

1210
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:46,500
Account is scrawny tonight.

1211
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,500
I can't let me talk.

1212
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,500
Okay.

1213
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,500
I think they fixed the talking.

1214
00:54:51,500 --> 00:55:00,500
I wish they would fix the freaking raid message issue.

1215
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:08,500
That literally, like it's really nice redirecting into someone like the outside of the agency,

1216
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,500
like if no one else is on or whatever.

1217
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,500
But when they're like, who raided?

1218
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,500
They're like, who is this?

1219
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:19,500
I'm like, hi, it's me.

1220
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,500
Yeah.

1221
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,500
Sometimes I don't even say anything.

1222
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,500
I'm just like, I'm too shy.

1223
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,500
No.

1224
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,500
I'm like, I'm too tired of the industry.

1225
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,500
I'm like, fuck it.

1226
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,500
I always say like, thank you for babysitting the refunds or something like that.

1227
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,500
Chair, thank you for the three membership.

1228
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,500
Oh my God.

1229
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,500
Our freebies are today.

1230
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,500
It's Wilfred motherfucking Wastash.

1231
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,500
What a name.

1232
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,500
Big Wilfred.

1233
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,500
Someone's Markiplier fan over here.

1234
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,500
Wilfred, do you talk?

1235
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,500
Who's the other?

1236
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,500
Who's the other?

1237
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,500
Hello, Wilfred.

1238
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,500
There you go.

1239
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,500
Next.

1240
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,500
Do you talk?

1241
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,500
Fuck's sake.

1242
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,500
Name has mics.

1243
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:54,500
The refunds were telling me that they don't even talk in game, that they don't have.

1244
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,500
Again?

1245
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,500
I heard that.

1246
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,500
It's so quiet.

1247
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,500
It's so quiet.

1248
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:06,500
Yeah, you be out for us.

1249
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,500
Oh, you're so quiet.

1250
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,500
I forgot I was muted.

1251
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,500
How do I make you talk?

1252
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,500
Yeah.

1253
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,500
How do I turn up game chat?

1254
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,500
Voice transmit volume?

1255
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,500
Tess?

1256
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,500
Tess?

1257
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,500
Where's the voice transmit volume?

1258
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,500
Speak.

1259

1261
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,500

1262
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,500
I'm just going to get more ammo.

1263
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,500
I'm going to heal it.

1264
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,500
I heard that, but it's so quiet.

1265
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,500
Yeah, it's still so quiet.

1266
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:47,500
Oh, it's probably receive volume.

1267
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,500
Why is this quiet?

1268
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,500
I don't know.

1269
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,500
Speak.

1270
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,500

1274
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:01,500
Alright, speak, motherfuckers.

1275
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:04,500

1276
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,500
I am speaking.

1277
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,500
Okay.

1278
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,500
I turned up the receive, so that's what you got to turn up.

1279
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,500
It's a little bit better.

1280
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:17,500
Alright, now meow for me.

1281
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,500
It's so quiet.

1282
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,500
We're not going to be able to hear the ones who leave the safe room,

1283
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,500
but I'll take it.

1284
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,500
I'll take it.

1285
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:28,500
I'm trying to get these pussies to meow for me and then not.

1286
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,500
One of them meowed.

1287
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,500
Oh, wait, I'm allowed to hold.

1288
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,500
Okay.

1289
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,500
Okay.

1290
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,500
I'm learning.

1291
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,500
I'm learning.

1292
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,500
I'm ready.

1293
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,500
I'm ready.

1294
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,500
I'm ready.

1295
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,500
Wow.

1296
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:50,500
This would sound like Italian music.

1297
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,500
Why does it say I'm protecting you with them?

1298
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,500
I don't know.

1299
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,500
I'm actually shooting right at you.

1300
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,500
If somebody attacks me and you shoot,

1301
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:01,500
but you just happen to shoot me at the same time.

1302
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,500
Wait, those zombies are fighting each other.

1303
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,500
I want to re-fund.

1304
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,500
Look at these. They have really nice

1305
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:11,340
mannequins

1306
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:14,140
Getting distracted

1307
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:20,140
We appear to be in what is known as a shopping mall. A shopping mall

1308
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:26,260
Look at that. They've got escalators. That's when you know, they mean business when it's got big escalators

1309
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:29,740
That's a big it's a big business when you get escalators

1310
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,740
I

1311
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:36,720
Was it cold and I heard there's like loads of abandoned

1312
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:44,160
Malls in America because like money nobody. Yeah, nobody goes everybody's online. They just shop one line, too

1313
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:52,260
Are you oh you're right next week

1314
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:58,920
I'm like trying so hard right now. I'm enjoying this. This is like game. I recommend yeah, it's pretty fun

1315
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:05,800
I'll be very interested to see how the 44 things go as I said, we're not going to do too much cam

1316
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,480
I don't know if the campaign's like

1317
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,360
Yes, you can come

1318
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,320
Three two one go

1319
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:25,760
I'm kidding. I'm teasing and teasing for a pleasing. Okay

1320
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:33,200
I cannot scratch my eye. My eye is wondering what's happening

1321
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,200
brought her to tears

1322
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,920
For some

1323
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Love being abused

1324
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,440
hell

1325
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,080
Oh, I think I got a piece of cat here in my eye

1326
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:55,080
I'm blind if I was playing this alone. I have to admit I'd be absolutely terrified right now

1327
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:59,320
But I'm actually really good. Oh, I get terrified playing on my own like

1328
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,160
In Elton ring like I've finished it now

1329
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:09,120
The reefland like stream state me and hold my hand the entire way because I get too terrified to play on my own

1330
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:14,120
Like I get so scared the moment. I can't spawn them in after a boss fight. That's so funny

1331
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:21,120
Wait, what did you how far did you get did you get to the DLC? Yeah, we did everything together. You did everything

1332
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,520
Yeah

1333
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:30,720
I mean I commentate on their face. They do really well

1334
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:34,680
That's so funny me who took like two hours to fight a boss

1335
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,280
We just

1336
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,960
I'm so stubborn

1337
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:48,560
No, I want help and I'm like no you play it how they want to play it. There's someone crying. Can we rescue humans in this game?

1338
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,720
That is not human

1339
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:02,960
I got her. I thought we could save humans. I was like, oh, maybe there's more

1340
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,880
That's how they trick you

1341
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:16,280
No, you play it the right way like I saw the monkey game and I thought oh you'd like that a

1342
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,280
It's like same kind of style and like you're like a proper gamer with it

1343
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:26,840
I am not a proper gamer. You're a proper gamer for certain games. You just don't like souls likes

1344
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,280
They're like, oh, are you gonna play like

1345
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:38,920
Dark Souls 3 or something like that the most like well-recommended one and I'm like, well, if you can't carry my hand

1346
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:45,400
And you'd probably be more scared because I feel like Dark Souls 3 is a little bit more scary

1347
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:54,320
Like I get frustrated fast as well. Like it doesn't go my way. I'm raging. I'm like, no, I know you're you rage quit

1348
01:01:55,080 --> 01:02:01,760
No, literally like I have to purposely plan around games that I know I can complete or not gonna frustrate me because I played this

1349
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:07,640
Old childhood game called blinks and I was fucking screaming at it. I was not having it

Spiked it multiple times the head to control area

1362
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:15,200
Because I had a one controller that was already broken. I kept it around specifically so I could break it further. Oh

01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,960

1532
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:56,000
And then we'll do that four v four game mode. Whatever it is. I have no idea what it involves, but we're gonna do it

1533
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:00,720
We're gonna do it. Let's do it seven hundred and seven zombies were harmed in the making of this

1534
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,440
Took a number. I love this game

1535
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:08,800
Well, this is no wonder it's so well received. This is like such a good game

1536
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:14,800
Right, so edit game sentence is without change the map chapter

1537
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:18,960
Wait, we could do the campaign in one day

1538
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,680
Tempting but how much time do you have my darling shady?

1539

Girl, I got nothing going on. I'm gonna go get some more water. Okay. Actually hold on. I need to feed my cat

1540
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,240
Yes, do that. Do that. Do that. I need to feed fia

1541
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:42,160
Because the thing went off 20 minutes ago. Wait, it's a different map. Oh, oh wait, hold on

1542
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:48,320
Play camping play with pals

1543
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:54,560
Free of lobby, but not that. Oh, oh no, we cannot complete the campaign

1544
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,600
There's too much

1545
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:03,840

01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,320
Why is the floor sticky?

1549
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:22,720
I was surprised. I was over airing it

1550
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,800
Please play numerically. Oh, I was gonna do it in order

1551
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,000
I think what I'll do is I'll play one more campaign

1552
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,800
For this stream snip and then we'll do the four v four game mode just for the rest for the shits and giggles

1553
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,280
And then I'll play the campaign

1554
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:47,840
With the reforges at a later date. We'll do the campaign together because I thoroughly enjoy this game

1555
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,800
I'm enjoying it. I did not realize how good it was. Like this is 10 out of 10

01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,080
What is her name?

1579
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,360
Well, I can't see you

1580
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:34,320
I'm so oh you're playing satisfactory. Yes, that's factor 1.0 came out master keith it told

1581
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,200
He he he peeler allegation

1582
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:45,440
I can't believe I have to unironically message a talent and say, hey, have you peed on an audio yet for your bonus unreward?

1583
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,640
Hey, hey, can you piss?

1584
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,040
Hey

1585
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,840
Right, anyway, sorry. Um, as you can imagine, I'm rather

1586
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,520
Hello

1587
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,520
Can you hear me? Can't hear anything

1588
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,520
Mummy next time you can just change the campaign and the lobby. Oh

1589
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:23,120
So be there satisfactory collab wins. I'm gonna give it a shot offline to see if I'll be able to play it or not

1590
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,520
I'm not sure though

1591
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:30,560
Sorry for taking she be spot early about no, don't actually be sorry. I'm not actually mad

1592
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,480
It's just because I know she be needs to come in

1593
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:37,440
But if people are trying to stream snipe the slot before I can even get she be in I'm like

1594
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:42,720
Give me a moment. Um as for my lovely leaflings. Um

1595
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:47,360
Sorry here. Um, I know you're lurking in the ship. I apologize. Um

1596
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:52,640
I will most likely play left for dead campaign with the reefland

1597
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:58,480
So you guys can stream snipe me for the campaign and we'll have some shenanigans afterwards. I'm not gonna ask she be of too much time

1598
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,240
however, um

1599
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:08,240
Because uh, she's working on her finalizing the donor thon and we're we're getting some, you know assets and all that

1600
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:10,240
Try not to assume why this a

1601
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,480
So I'm not gonna ask too much time

1602
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:19,120
Do I count down from win to enter? Are you three?

1603
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,920
seven

1604
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:23,920
Two you're getting closer

1605
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,920
One

1606
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,080
You're almost the lead to enter

1607
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:34,480
Zero you can come and the lobby

1608
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,240
You

1609
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:47,120
Mummy don't mind me if I'm rubbish. I'm a bit rusty. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1610
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:51,760
We're literally playing easy mode because I've never played this game before but can I just say

1611
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,360
For when does this game come out? I'm I'm pleasantly surprised

1612
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,160
um

1613
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:06,240
How like how good it feels like the guns feel nice the weaponry feels nice

1614
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:17,120
Um, it doesn't feel overwhelming the audio cues are fantastically placed like fantastically played. This is lovely game 2009. Okay

1615
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:19,280
this

1616
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:25,840
I must say this game. Uh, I might rank it a 10 out of 10 already. Like it's so fair. Um

1617
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,200
It's so

1618
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:35,760
Like consider it to the player if you want, um, there's medical supplies where you need them

1619
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:43,840
Uh, just I think this is a fucking well rounded polished game. I don't know how long development was. I wouldn't mind. Uh

1620
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,880
but yeah

1621
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,440
This is really good

1622
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,000
Really really good

1623
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:57,040
I know it was highly rated, but I just never got a chance to play it. The game director is very nice

1624
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:05,520
Are you nervous? Wait, you're nervous. Why are you nervous to play with me? I'm not gonna say anything mean

1625
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,840
I'm not a mean evil beanie

1626
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:15,120
Don't be nervous to play with me because it's about development was one year. They put this together in a year

1627
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:20,960
The mechanics are easy to pick up. The gunplay is great and it switches up. Um tanks

1628
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,840
Oh, it switches up. Thanks to the director

1629
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,560
Yeah, Left 4 Dead was released

1630
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,520
It's actually more generous

1631
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:33,680
The shittier you play more mid spawn when your teams have lower health

1632
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:40,080
Eventually, I think I fell down. I don't know. Yeah, two cute girls feeding my cast would speak amongst yourselves

1633
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,360
No, we're just sort of discussing the game. Um

1634
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:49,600
And uh, I'm seeing that's a really good game. I'm I'm very pleasantly surprised

1635
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:53,840
I I just never got the opportunity to play it and I'm so glad that I get to play

1636
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:58,320
But I mean fuck like this is gonna be unironically not to get sappy or anything

1637
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:03,200
This is gonna be cemented in my heart because not only did I get to play the game for the first time

1638
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:06,880
I got to do it with sheebie and I also got to do it with harem and reefland

1639
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:11,440
Like are you going are you trying to make me cry right now? No, I will cry everywhere

1640
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,920
I was serious like I get to

1641
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,920
Like I stream snip all over the reefland

1642
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:22,800
But so what happened was on the schedule I planned this game

1643
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,440
But I was just it was just gonna be me and you reeflands

1644
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:31,360
And then she be messaged me out of nowhere. She was um, I didn't expect it and she was like, can I play with you?

1645
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,360
And I'm like, uh, yes

1646
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,600
You want to stream stick together?

1647
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:41,200
Like the thought didn't even cross my mind that it was even possible that I could collab

1648
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:47,040
And also play at the same time at like both ways and like I'm just

1649
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:52,320
I'm very I'm a very happy being right now that I get to experience this for the first time with you

1650
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:56,320
It's very nice. My heart is very filled. So thank you for I'm so happy

1651
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:01,280
Yeah, thank you for asking seriously because I it didn't cross my mind that it was possible

1652
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:03,680
Yeah

1653
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,880
I was like, oh

1654
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,080
Harem has been asking like if what I'm gonna do left for two again

1655
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:12,320
And I'm like, I don't know. I really don't have anyone to play with and then I saw it on her schedule

1656
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:18,240
And I'm like, oh, maybe strongy will let me play with her in the reeflings and then she said yes

1657
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,120
Are you serious? Yes

1658
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,720
Uh, right had the putters been fed check on boomi been fed

1659
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:32,960
Uh, boomi is currently eating. I'm still feeding fia. Okay, little fia. Sorry. She is taking her time

1660
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,000
She's good. No, she's allowed to take all the time. She won't

1661
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,200
She is a madam

1662
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,200
Of a high caliber

1663
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,840
Here will you eat from my hand ma'am?

1664
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:47,520
Sometimes she needs to switch between the bowl in my hand. I don't know why

1665
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:52,880
It has a good mods community as well. Can I put bigger boobs on my model?

1666
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,800
And you're a guy, I imagine. Oh

1667
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:01,040
Oh, I wonder what's gonna be a guy in the next one. All the men have to

1668
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:05,040
You unironically can there's a mod for that

1669
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,520
To make them all have boobies

1670
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:12,400
Wait, can I make all the zombies like zombie girls and it's like, oh, no, they won

1671
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:16,400
They won. I don't know something. I want my cummies

1672
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:21,840
They won the ink. You will never have the refling ink. It's inside me all along

1673
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:26,640
But yeah, are you done?

1674
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:30,560
There's a lot different mods, so I wouldn't be surprised if you can. I had anime girls as zombies

1675
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,960
If you ask someone they can make a model of you and the girls

1676
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,880
What? No, just too much. Imagine us, us as a game

1677
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:42,160
That's too much to ask for. I think I'll do minecraft skins. How about that?

1678
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:46,320
I'll be a cheeky sod and ask for minecraft skins if anyone knows how to make them

1679
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:50,480
So I don't have to pay someone to do it because I don't know how it works

1680
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:55,680
They're pretty, they're pretty cheap though. I got like a really good minecraft skin for like 15 bucks

1681
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:58,640
I think

1682
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:01,680
A Cod Zombie Baby

1683
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:09,280
You can have rule 34 mod support in Leopardy 2. I don't think we'll be streaming that one

1684
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:13,280
Uh, however, I'm glad that you do

1685
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,080
And I'm booted up, I'm booted up

1686
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,960
She is like a picky eater today because she's constipated. She has like a fat belly

1687
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,360
Because she hasn't pooped in like two days

1688
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,640
I feel so bad

1689
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:39,120
Do you have what's called a licky lick in America? It's just like a tube of liquid food

1690
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:45,520
But oh, yeah, treat each tube. Those will get some water in there. I think yeah. Oh, no, she'll drink water

1691
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,520
It's like the food. It's like she knows

1692
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:52,480
It's because of her medication. She has like a little pot belly right now. I feel so bad

1693
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:57,440
I usually give her like mere lax and then that are like a lax

1694
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:02,000
I honestly thought you were about to say I give her an enema and I was like, oh, I could

1695
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:05,120
I won't

1696
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,440
I don't want to give up an enema

1697
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:10,880
No, I was gonna I was like resisting saying that

1698
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,040
I was um

1699
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:19,840
I have a I used to have a boy cat and he was the funniest cat ever proofing back in Scotland. Um

1700
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,880
And I took him to the vet

1701
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:29,840
Uh, and he was really attached to me. So he purred a lot. Um, he was bean little bean

1702
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,720
Um, and he was attached to me at the hip

1703
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:37,040
So he used to purr and he was at the vet, but he was purring every time I interacted with him

1704
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:44,160
And then he got a thermometer shoved up, you know, where and then he burst out purring even louder and I was like, what's going on here?

1705
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:46,480
I

1706
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:52,320
Like the vet started laughing as well because all of us were like staring at the cat like excuse you

1707
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:58,720
Like because obviously the vets are like, oh the cat hates this part. So just hold them down or whatever

1708
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:03,600
And he starts purring louder. I'm like, uh bean have you got something you'd like to tell us?

1709
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:07,920
Bean like something stuck up as bean

1710
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:15,200
Although some cats like to purr like for anxious is like self soothing. So hopefully

1711
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:27,680
That cat was rifling coated right you're done. Don't don't type about my callie

1712
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,640
And hair I'm coated to be honest

1713
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:37,440
Oh, I oh wait. No, I'm only it's water. Boomi. It's just water come down. Boomi's like trying to steal food

1714
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:41,360
I need to give the kitty her meds

1715
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:47,760
Little pooters is a liquid medication stuff. Yes. Oh, that'll be easier for her to take

1716
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,560
Yeah, it's uh fish flavored

1717
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:55,200
So she does it's she takes it like a churu like one of those little tubes. I'm different

1718
01:31:56,160 --> 01:32:03,600
Thank you staff for the tip this game popularized for player horde shooting and they all draw some inspiration from this game

1719
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:09,920
The mod that came with this and other valve games help innovate the modding community as well

1720
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:11,760
Oh

1721
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:13,200
I believe it

1722
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:19,920
No, I didn't I don't believe that very much too. Uh narrow a cod zombies on black ops 2 stream would be fun

1723
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Did they fix the servers on that one?

1724
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,400
Yeah

1725
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:27,760
Ti crimson. Thank you for the extended membership

1726
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:33,440
Just got home. How are they doing you guys protecting our favorite girls? They're scared of us

1727
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:35,920
We've had like

1728
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:37,920
Two people talking the mic and no one else

1729
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:43,760
We're playing one more round of the campaign and then we're going to be playing a game mode which is floor v4

1730
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:45,920
um

Well, help technically in like lobbies. Yeah

2051
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:32,880

I'm about on the street

2058
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:10,120
Rather than a back on the street

2059
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:12,120
I

2060
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:21,520

01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:53,680
Why is she purple?

2066
01:57:55,880 --> 01:58:01,760
Oh strange very dark press F to turn on your flash

2067
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:03,760

01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:15,720
Wish I had a chainsaw. Oh, we're work. Oh

2069
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:19,560
Was a boomer. That was confused. Oh

2070
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:22,840
God, there's so many

2071
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:27,560
You should do a party. We'll keep boomer. Okay, boomie. Whatever you say

2072
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:31,320
Okay

2073

01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:45,120
I will take an adrenaline shot

2075
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:56,720
Yeah, the haremling can heal themselves they have a heel

2076
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:03,880
Uh

2077
01:59:04,240 --> 01:59:06,320
Okay, I got it. We were a bit old

2078
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:22,360
Okay, I'm fine. What a unique enemy. Is it dead? No come back if you're gonna lick me at least let me kill you

2079
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:25,800
Oh, yeah, that's the one that's the smokers one that grabs you with the tongue. I

2080
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:31,200
Don't know why

2081
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:34,360
I do like the enemy's very

2082
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:40,040
Yeah, they're pretty cool. Definitely scary. Mm-hmm. I

2083
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:43,280
Don't like enemies that can grab you

2084
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:50,640
I like that. It removes your ability to play until your team needs help. Yeah, the whole point is the place together

2085
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:53,760
Oh

2086
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:08,160
This is actually a horror game

2087
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:13,520
It's when they come out of nowhere when you didn't expect it like you don't hear the audio

2088
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:17,200
Yeah

2089
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:21,960
Sorry

2090
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:27,600
Can you stop shooting me? Yeah, what is this poop water and I

2091
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:30,560

2092
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:34,280
Oh, it works. I don't know what is going on. I hope you're okay

2093
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:40,960
Hope you're okay

2094
02:00:43,640 --> 02:00:45,640
Okay, I stuck up there

2095
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:50,920
Get off my jock

2096
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:57,360
Joachy I can't get up here. That's us. We can ask you something embarrassing. Of course

2097
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:59,600
What's the joke? Oh

2098
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:07,640
I can't tell you because so I was like a jockstrap otherwise known as the banana hammock

2099
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:13,080
I was a I was looking at lingerie with the with the harlots in one of my streams

2100
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:18,240
And we were looking at jockstraps and I was trying it's like almost like a thong for men. Oh

2101
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
It's like, yeah

2102
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:24,720
It'll be a moment to think of what it was for a second

2103
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:31,520
Y'all ready, so I'm like you guys should buy them and then you know you use it in a bedroom

2104
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:35,140
I don't I think guys just wear them. I

2105
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:40,940
Think it's like the equivalent of like girls wearing a thong, right?

2106
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:46,480
What do we do we jump girls wearing? Oh, I'm like girls right we wear thongs

2107
02:01:48,120 --> 02:01:50,120
You wear clothes

2108
02:01:55,120 --> 02:01:57,120
I

2109
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:07,840
Thought it was just like a male thong. I didn't think it was like a cup thing

2110
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:17,760
Right keep moving keep moving up the ladder up the ladder up the ladder come on move out move out move out

2111
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:22,720
But I like the pool water. I can't run to the same room this fucking lady

2112
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:26,960
Oh

2113
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:29,280
Where's the ladder go

2114
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:35,040

2119
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:02,240
I'm stuck. Oh my god. Uh, hello

2120
02:03:04,240 --> 02:03:06,240
I'm trying and you don't hit you

2121
02:03:07,680 --> 02:03:10,800
I don't think there's something fire like actual damage so

2122
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:14,640
I don't know

2123
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:17,120
Well, if I shoot you right now

2124
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:19,600
Yeah, help isn't going down. Is it not?

2125
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:22,560
No

2126
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:27,760
Why do they pretend to I mean, I guess maybe it's just for

2127
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,800
We go in the tunnels. Stop shooting each other

2128
02:03:31,600 --> 02:03:33,600
Pardon me

2129
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:45,600
Jesus Christ

2130
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:47,600
Oh

02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:54,560
Run past all of us. All right. Um getting stung long

2132
02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:01,120
I have a d-fib

2133
02:04:01,120 --> 02:04:03,120
That's good because

2134
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:07,600
Heal yourself. I know. Yeah, I see ruin is on his last leg. Yeah

2135
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:15,760
We can make it. Come on. Don't give up. Of course the noxious acid is by the fluffy ladder

2136
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:26,080
This one is stuck. I love glitches and uh, right. I'm nuking myself. It's been lovely. It's been lovely. No, really

2137
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:28,080
It's been an absolute pleasure. Oh

2138
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:30,720
You nuked us too by the way

2139
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:33,520
Oh, hey, there's health up here though

2140
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:46,800
You need it more than I do

2141
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:51,760
Oh, this dude is running away. He ran into the safe room. Oh, there's a safe room

2142
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:57,040
How did he run into the safe room? That's so weird. God, um, make it right now

2143
02:04:57,920 --> 02:04:59,920
I'm feeling so hard right now. I have to heal

2144
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:03,200
Oh, I've healed so hard

2145
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:08,960
Oh, it doesn't even feel so hard. Motherfuckers want to find me. Oh, we rocked to close the door. That's why

2146
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:12,960
Whipsies

2147
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:15,600
Yeah, no friendly fire on easy

2148
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:17,760
Do you mean easy?

2149
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:20,720
Oh

2150
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:25,840
These accusations that I only play games on easy mode of shopping. I don't know why I'm not there

2151
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:28,320
Surely. I don't know

2152
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:33,760
Can I get over how nice the weaponry feels in this game?

2153
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:38,640
Which is what one would say a 10 out of 10. I reach it very highly

2154
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:40,560
Thanks for the game

2155
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:42,800
You're welcome. Thanks for barking

2156
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:45,200
I would like to see

2157
02:05:46,160 --> 02:05:48,160
Mercy and Icy play this game

2158
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:53,120
We should feel like Icy would just be screaming the entire time. So would mercy

2159
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:56,400
Does mercy emotions look amazing?

2160
02:05:57,680 --> 02:05:59,680
Probably

2161
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:05,680
I've found it very hard to I can't figure out what games make messes thick and not

2162
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:09,440
I think first person she's okay and its third person is the problem

2163
02:06:10,160 --> 02:06:13,760
Oh, I think if it's over the shoulder and the camera isn't

2164
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:16,800
Oh focused, then that's what gives her emotion quick now

2165
02:06:19,040 --> 02:06:23,760
Okay, we got label label and we got to reluctantly saying hello

2166

Hated it. Yeah, we'll help you. Do you want to come along with us?

2188
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:21,280
The left or dead one crew is it? But oh, that's funny. I didn't know that

2189
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:26,240
I thought I recognized them. Okay, but if you change your mind, that's cool. Okay

2190
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:31,840
Oh, so the left or dead two takes off where the other team finished. That's so cool

2191
02:08:32,720 --> 02:08:40,080
I like we love continuity and sequels with new players shadow is really funny. Yeah, we love sequels that are actually sequels

2192
02:08:41,600 --> 02:08:43,600
Notice they're missing one person

2193
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:49,200
No, no, they're all here

2194
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:52,400
I think I think they're fourth perished

2195
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:54,800
and

2196
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:57,440
Spoiler oh true

2197
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:59,600
No, at least there's ammo right here. Oh

2198
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:02,400
No, I'm being ridden

2199
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:06,960
Oh, I was shooting a human. Oh, so was I

2200
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:12,400
It look we're a bit used to just sprain and play and do forgive us

2201
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:16,320
But sorry about that. Sorry. Sorry. It's just a wee bit of a misunderstanding

2202
02:09:17,120 --> 02:09:21,600
Oh, we got to get gas cans. Okay. We gotta do this gas can retrieval thing again. Jesus Christ

2203
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:23,600
Ah

2204
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:31,520
Where is the closest? Yeah, it's a gas again. Yeah, you're gonna build up the generator tonight

2205
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:42,960
Where can I get to this generator? I mean this gas can

2206
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:51,280
Where oh, that's over here go away. This looks suspiciously like a massive trap

2207
02:09:52,240 --> 02:09:54,240
And I'm not sure

2208
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:03,920
Oh, I found a katana. Don't mind if I do

2209
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:07,040
Katana

2210
02:10:07,040 --> 02:10:09,040
Oh, she's named after a sharp weapon

2211
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:14,240
Oh my gosh, I get it now. I get it now

2212
02:10:14,240 --> 02:10:16,240
Oh

2213
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:19,360
Oh, I keep getting fucking stuck

2214
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:22,480
This is not the easiest map

2215
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:26,480
Oh, yeah, I'm getting fucking pinned again. Thank you for leaving me

2216
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:28,160
I

2217
02:10:28,160 --> 02:10:32,640
Oh, I don't have rest. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. It was worth it. It's been lovely. It really has

2218
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:38,080
Where are you? I'm fucking you can I always just do a lot of self-cult fail

2219
02:10:38,080 --> 02:10:42,800
I heard these tanks so spread out. Oh my god

2220
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:48,320
It's throwing a slab of concrete at me

2221
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:53,200
What? How does he even comprehend?

2222
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:58,080
It picked up the floor and throw it

2223
02:11:00,240 --> 02:11:02,240
She's slow way

2224
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:07,680
Well that that's a bit dramatic for a zombie. Don't you think?

2225
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:15,360
That's a great question. Why doesn't anything have enough gas in it?

2226
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:22,560
Oh, thank you. Did you know that during a real zombie apocalypse that going for gasoline

2227
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:26,640
Is it the smartest thing to do because it doesn't have good preservation? Yep

2228
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:32,400
There's no point because it did you know that it's most likely

2229
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:38,080
That seeds will be a very high commodity to grow your own food and become farmers again if a zombie

2230
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:49,680
I watch the walking dead I get it. Oh, you watch the I watch the what do you need help? I'm helping. I'm helping

2231
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:54,640
Oh, you're getting you're getting caught. Oh, I'm getting caught too. Hold on a minute. Let me pick you up

2232
02:11:56,720 --> 02:11:58,720
Ah

2233
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:04,800
I have a deep in

2234
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:07,360
Oh, I have a heal kit

2235
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:10,160
Oh

2236
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:13,200
If we can't hurt each other, I'm spraying and spraying

2237
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:18,000
Oh, I'm helping. I'm helping. Oh, there's a thing back there. Why are you getting?

2238
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:23,920
Uh, do you I think uh, oh I defend myself

2239
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:26,000
Uh

2240
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Who are you fiving? You can't

2241
02:12:31,200 --> 02:12:33,200
I defend you

2242
02:12:36,080 --> 02:12:38,080
Oh, I fell in my own gas

2243
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:40,800
Can I defend you?

2244
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:42,800
Oh, wait, you're not dead dead. So it doesn't matter

2245
02:12:44,080 --> 02:12:46,080
I'm not dead yet. Oh, no

2246
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:50,880
Okay, I help I was trying to get you and I got attacked by something. Oh god

2247
02:12:51,280 --> 02:12:54,640
This is but why is this map so hard? Did I make it normal?

2248
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:57,360
I don't think this is easy

2249
02:12:58,080 --> 02:13:02,160
I mean super different expert modes. Oh, where is this fucking smoker?

2250
02:13:02,720 --> 02:13:07,200
Smoker that got me. We literally I was gonna say we literally cannot. Can someone pick up?

2251
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:11,520
Someone pick him up. I got him. Okay. I'm gonna kill the zombies around him

2252
02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:16,960
Get him Labeel. I got you. I'm covering. I have one health

2253
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:22,800
Why oh did I miss the memo? How did I just go down?

2254
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:26,960
No

2255
02:13:29,680 --> 02:13:32,480
What what happened

2256
02:13:43,120 --> 02:13:45,680
Is that supposed to happen legendary mode

2257
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:52,320
It literally I told you I was playing legendary mode. None of you's believe me. They're just not yours. They're strong easy

2258
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:57,200
No, it doesn't I just have we have it says easy

2259
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:02,560
I wish I had that defense

2260
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:09,200
So no, no, no, no, we never got to win. You have to win. No, you have to win. You have to stay

2261
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:11,600
You're not allowed to leave until we win

2262
02:14:13,040 --> 02:14:19,280
It doesn't count. That's not how it works. Right. Okay. Thank you. So what did I do shotgun? I lost my katana

2263
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:24,640
No, I prefer the assault rifle. I'm an assault rifle gal. You know what I'm saying? I'm an assault rifle gal

2264
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:27,440
All right, I'll talk to these

2265
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:29,840
goofballs again

2266
02:14:30,640 --> 02:14:32,160
Hey

2267
02:14:32,160 --> 02:14:35,600
It gets harder the more gas cans you get so you better see oh

2268
02:14:35,680 --> 02:14:38,720
So don't put them in just grab the cans and put them to the side

2269
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:40,720
Okay

2270
02:14:40,720 --> 02:14:44,080
The caller stays on until mommy wins. Exactly. Oh, that's right

2271
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:48,320
Let's get you on your way. All right. I won't get any gas in this generator

2272
02:14:49,360 --> 02:14:53,360
But we'll we'll get our stocks up for stonks. It'll be super duper high

2273
02:14:55,600 --> 02:14:57,600
The highest

2274
02:14:57,680 --> 02:15:01,200
They're locked in with strunnion she be. They must be terrified

2275
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:07,680
Literally, you're forced to stay away. I don't care if you've got work. You've got responsibilities. They're forced

2276
02:15:08,240 --> 02:15:12,960
We are not leaving until we get to take priority. I will take this pipe bomb. Thank you very much

2277
02:15:14,240 --> 02:15:16,240
All right, so I guess

2278
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:22,320
Just bring it over. Grab them and bring me. I keep doing that. I keep doing that right over that. She's a nice lady. She didn't she's protecting

2279
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:27,920
Where that we went down that was like over where

2280
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:31,600
Okay, is that one all the way over here? I can grab

2281
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:34,880
one two

2282
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:37,680
And then we just put them all in it once

2283
02:15:39,600 --> 02:15:41,600
Very gently go away

2284
02:15:42,240 --> 02:15:48,480
Right, that's a horde sound. So I'm gonna purposefully stay behind with the mpc until the horde sound goes away

2285
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:54,160
I'm not getting shagged at all. Why am I on fire?

2286
02:15:55,600 --> 02:15:57,600
Because you're feeling hot hot hot

2287
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:06,960
They accidentally blow up the gas can that I have. Can you do that? Well a response

2288
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:13,840
I know it respawned it respawned

2289
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:17,520
All right, I need to make sure we're doing

2290
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:22,160
Wait, wait, wait, don't put them in don't put them in don't put them in if you put them in it makes it harder. No

2291
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:27,600
Yeah, we're leaving them out here. Just gather them and then drop them in there nearby

2292
02:16:29,600 --> 02:16:31,600
You're too efficient

2293
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:37,120
Harling

2294
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:46,320
I'm reloading that's what five cans right. I'm gonna go get

2295
02:16:47,520 --> 02:16:50,400
I think that we've horde noises over wherever that was

2296
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:53,760
I'll grab that. There's something big stomping around

2297
02:16:54,800 --> 02:16:58,160
What? Fuck. Fuck. Oh, yeah

2298
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:03,200
Don't go for me

2299
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:09,760
What there's so many special ones over here

2300
02:17:10,080 --> 02:17:12,080
Oh

2301
02:17:12,320 --> 02:17:14,320
Jesus

2302
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:24,800
Oh, you grabbed it. Okay. Does this smoke hurt? Oh something's spitting bail and it's not me for once

2303
02:17:30,320 --> 02:17:34,880
Yeah, I'll just like burst out of a fucking room. Okay, that bus is killer. Thank you gaming

2304
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:37,680

2307
02:17:59,120 --> 02:18:01,120
Come closer closer

2308
02:18:01,680 --> 02:18:03,680
I believe in you

2309
02:18:04,560 --> 02:18:10,880
You can do it. I promise you can continue on without me. I couldn't make it in time

2310
02:18:14,880 --> 02:18:18,400
Oh, okay, right. I feel better. Thank you for that. Oh, perfect. Nice. Uh

2311
02:18:19,600 --> 02:18:23,040
Oh, what the prick girl is another drop or hunter

2312
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:27,200
Oh

2313
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:34,720
The rag doll is great that day. All right, let's find some more. Oh, we'll be all died. Hold on. Where do they die?

2314
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:37,040
I don't know

2315
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:41,600
Tape in the chat. Where are you? I can't see wait wait open the defibrillators

2316
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:47,360
And there'll be a red dot where he is on the map if you have the defibrillators on I do I don't see a red dot

2317
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:53,280
Did you disconnect? Oh, I found him. I found him. I found him. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. Where are you?

2318
02:18:53,680 --> 02:18:55,680
Help. Help. Help. I'm right in front of you

2319
02:18:57,440 --> 02:18:59,440
Hold on. Let me look

02:18:59,440 --> 02:19:02,320
Right, I'm gonna go pick up more ammo. Very selfishly

2321
02:19:03,600 --> 02:19:05,600
I hear a specialist

2322
02:19:07,360 --> 02:19:09,360
Spit

2323
02:19:11,440 --> 02:19:13,440
Right, I'm gonna go pick up more

2324
02:19:16,080 --> 02:19:18,080
Shit, I never thought about that

2325
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:20,960
No

2326
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:23,280
No

2327
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:25,280
Strutting

2328
02:19:27,600 --> 02:19:29,600
Oh my god

2329
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:37,120
Oh my god, I did not just do that too much

2330
02:19:39,360 --> 02:19:46,320
I'm so sorry. I can't believe I just said that. All right, at least they respawn. Let's do this

2331
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:49,200
We have to do all of them. I'm so sorry

02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:03,920
Right. Fuck it. Just put the cans in the fucking thing because I'm gonna end up doing that again

2335
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:05,920
I can just see it. I honestly can

2336
02:20:08,080 --> 02:20:11,120
I think what it was is maybe we were being attacked by a horde

2337
02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:14,960
Cuz

2338
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:17,760

2353
02:22:22,840 --> 02:22:24,840
Okay

02:31:07,720 --> 02:31:09,720
We're not playing this again

2450
02:31:10,760 --> 02:31:12,880
We just got lost Ronnie just left us

Oh, I'm so sorry the soul survivor. I'm not playing that

2455
02:31:40,520 --> 02:31:43,920
That was horrible. That was so hard for no reason

2456
02:31:46,360 --> 02:31:48,360
So so hard

2457
02:31:52,360 --> 02:31:54,360
Yeah, I didn't want to play that again, so honestly

2458
02:31:56,520 --> 02:32:00,280
You're actually playing this level again later. No, no

2459
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:06,000
Before we're doing the 4v4 shenanigans. Okay, I can right-click to shove. I know

2460
02:32:06,920 --> 02:32:08,920
Will I use it? No

2461
02:32:09,640 --> 02:32:11,160
Exactly you tell him

I don't know what it is

2464
02:32:14,800 --> 02:32:19,920
So you're gonna have to tell me how to get into overall accuracy as if I have the highest accuracy

2465
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:22,560
15% let's go

2466
02:32:24,680 --> 02:32:26,960
1000 zombies killed wow

2467
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
So close never end them

2468
02:32:31,720 --> 02:32:37,760
Then my game just crashed no, okay, right I just heard and then that was it right, okay

2469
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:40,640
Let us analyze

2470
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:46,840
So if I want to do this 4v4 thing, I would like to

That's not a nice thing to call yourself. You should be very special. I know I need to be careful with your words

2487
02:34:10,520 --> 02:34:15,520
Cuz you'll start thinking it's true. If you put it into existence, you start willing it, okay?

2488
02:34:17,080 --> 02:34:19,320

2523
02:37:22,240 --> 02:37:25,440
Was trying to listen. I was listening real close

2524
02:37:27,440 --> 02:37:32,440
I was like everybody should be able to hear her

2525
02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:39,860

You can put a compilation of all our peas together. Yeah

2529
02:37:52,900 --> 02:37:58,900
You just listen to it on repeat instead of listening to a like one hour of rain to put yourself to sleep

2530
02:37:58,900 --> 02:38:00,900
It's just one hour

2531
02:38:01,420 --> 02:38:03,420
That'd be a good idea

2532
02:38:04,060 --> 02:38:06,060

You're literally put on YouTube strangely enough, right?

2536
02:38:18,500 --> 02:38:23,140
Assume if a hit start game is gonna do the right. It's gonna randomize the rest. So if the other

Snipers aren't bothered. We'll just jump right into it and let's get started now, obviously

02:47:31,460 --> 02:47:33,460
I love this part of the map

2641
02:47:34,420 --> 02:47:36,420
Well better than that

2642
02:47:38,100 --> 02:47:40,100
Can I be seen where did we go?

2643
02:47:44,020 --> 02:47:47,620
We have to claim we'll go down the hill. Yep, yes

2644
02:48:00,900 --> 02:48:02,900
I'm fucking spraying and praying

2645

02:48:12,500 --> 02:48:18,660
That's a little bit. Yeah, I was gonna I was gonna say, uh, uh, probably you're gonna hear me screaming in the next round

2648
02:48:21,140 --> 02:48:24,420
Are we supposed to be able to like to kill you all at the same time and then we know

2649
02:48:25,060 --> 02:48:30,100
So our health is definitely getting low like don't think you're not doing anything like we're getting fucked up over here

We've not had any heals. So please don't

Get out, literally we are so down. Oh, perfect

I got blank a blank name. There's no name stash and hikaru

2695
02:52:32,580 --> 02:52:36,980
I've got a slot for wait. There's someone without a name. Yeah, literally no name. Whoa

2696
02:52:38,020 --> 02:52:42,020
Uh, I guess we'll call you peaches puke because it looks like peaches

2697
02:52:42,740 --> 02:52:44,740
So

2698
02:52:47,620 --> 02:52:50,260
All right, let's let's move up move up gentlemen

2699
02:52:54,820 --> 02:53:00,500
Oh, oh, they just freaking came out of nowhere. Can't spawn here can't be seen by survivors

2700
02:53:01,620 --> 02:53:03,620
primary attack

2701
02:53:04,740 --> 02:53:06,740
What this is bizarre

2702
02:53:08,420 --> 02:53:10,420
Oh what

2703
02:53:12,020 --> 02:53:16,340
Okay, I understand. I am I comprehend what we should do

2704
02:53:23,780 --> 02:53:30,020
Look the trick is to use snipers. Really? I feel like snipers are so hard to deal with

2705
02:53:31,220 --> 02:53:33,780
I'll probably just spot them from farther away

2706
02:53:35,220 --> 02:53:37,780
Just like there's not that much in the chamber

2707
02:53:38,420 --> 02:53:41,540
All right, so I need to back away

2708
02:53:46,180 --> 02:53:48,180
Am I in

2709
02:54:00,660 --> 02:54:02,900
I didn't know no, I knocked them down, but I never killed

2710
02:54:03,380 --> 02:54:08,100
But I was just like I'm creeping around jump jump. I look like a little leap pro going left and right

2711
02:54:08,100 --> 02:54:10,660
I'm like, yeah, my pinks protecting me. You can't shoot me

2712
02:54:13,940 --> 02:54:15,940
I'm stuck

2713
02:54:19,060 --> 02:54:25,140
Oh, my ping is literally I am lagging so hard. Honestly, it's a what characters live

2714
02:54:27,140 --> 02:54:29,140
Leap. Oh, right. Okay. I've got the same one again

2715
02:54:33,780 --> 02:54:35,780
I

2716
02:54:36,340 --> 02:54:38,340
Can hear one of them

2717
02:54:51,460 --> 02:54:53,460
That's so cute

2718
02:54:57,700 --> 02:54:59,700
I'm coming for you

2719
02:55:00,420 --> 02:55:08,900
Oh my god, that's so good. I was like jumping like a horse or like a frog down there coming to get you. Oh, what the hell?

2720
02:55:11,220 --> 02:55:14,180
This is a shotgun set. Oh, it definitely counts one here

2721
02:55:18,580 --> 02:55:20,580
Oh my god, the lag is killing me

2722
02:55:21,620 --> 02:55:23,620
Oh

2723
02:55:24,740 --> 02:55:27,460
I screamed my vomit, but I couldn't really oh no

2724
02:55:28,340 --> 02:55:29,460
Oh

2725
02:55:29,460 --> 02:55:34,340
That boomers are quite hard to play. I'm not sure they're the most effective. Yeah, you literally just have to run

2726
02:55:36,100 --> 02:55:41,860
Everybody your bomb gets on them. No, don't bomb every plane. Okay. Mommy's the place

2727

2731
02:56:11,060 --> 02:56:15,060
Ah sugar may stop one off. I got confused. I thought of is the other zombie

2732
02:56:19,940 --> 02:56:21,940

Oh, that's me. Oh, no, I will I know I'm supposed to be on there. I might die sooner than the other guys

2735
02:56:34,340 --> 02:56:39,300

2823
03:04:30,900 --> 03:04:32,900
We want to be able to perish all in

That doesn't make any sense to me. I can't leap

03:13:58,980 --> 03:14:00,980

2932
03:14:21,300 --> 03:14:23,300

2941
03:14:49,060 --> 03:14:51,060

2945
03:15:12,340 --> 03:15:17,860
You may be able to do it. You're not too down. I don't know you're a bit damaged, but

2946
03:15:18,820 --> 03:15:24,100
I think it's the actual normal mpc zombies or what's really getting us

2947
03:15:24,740 --> 03:15:28,100
Everyone looks green on mine. Maybe it's not showing your health. No, yeah

2948
03:15:28,100 --> 03:15:32,580
No, it doesn't show it like because I'm I'm really close to death right now. Oh, right. Okay. I take it. Sorry

2950
03:15:38,020 --> 03:15:41,700
No, yeah, when you're the monster you can't really see the accuracy of the health

2951
03:15:43,540 --> 03:15:45,540
Oh my god

2954
03:15:58,500 --> 03:16:04,020
I'm such a bleed. I don't have anything to fucking throw. I'm almost out of ammo

And then uh, I actually to talk a bit more about what work I got done yesterday

3015
03:20:45,060 --> 03:20:52,900
Um, I wrote 11 shorts like pre-recorded shorts. Um, I've recorded about

3016
03:20:54,500 --> 03:20:58,260
Eight of them one of them needs to be recorded with the ASMR microphone

3017
03:20:58,740 --> 03:21:01,860
So tomorrow I'm waking up at midnight

3018
03:21:02,420 --> 03:21:05,860
So I can tap on the key chains and do a little hand

3019
03:21:06,180 --> 03:21:08,180
A ASMR video

3020
03:21:08,340 --> 03:21:13,460
11 shorts is good. I was only supposed to do five but I kept going. Who wants to bark for me?

3021
03:21:14,500 --> 03:21:16,500
All right, but keep your hands to yourself

3022
03:21:17,780 --> 03:21:20,740
No one you just shy of bark anyone

3023
03:21:22,340 --> 03:21:26,100
I think they don't have microphones. I don't know they use have microphone

3024
03:21:27,140 --> 03:21:29,140
um

3025
03:21:29,140 --> 03:21:31,700
Well, I'm ready when you are I don't have a microphone

3026
03:21:31,940 --> 03:21:33,940
All right, let's go

3027
03:21:34,980 --> 03:21:37,940
Crouching improves accuracy. Oh, it's like fiasco

3028
03:21:38,500 --> 03:21:42,260
Maybe may I ask about playing off the side? I'd like to make fun of the pants

3029
03:21:42,660 --> 03:21:46,740
I was just going to do random and make sure everyone gets them before I go off because I'm I'm trying to do

3030
03:21:47,780 --> 03:21:50,260
A lot of work for me. Um

3031
03:21:51,700 --> 03:21:53,700
Because I've been

3032
03:21:53,780 --> 03:21:59,460
Putting a lot off, but I believe I can get the yumi collab up finally today

3033
03:22:00,420 --> 03:22:06,580
Um, I think you can get the yumi collab up for tomorrow. Um, I just need to oh god

3034
03:22:06,580 --> 03:22:08,580
When is it gonna start respawning? I'm scared

3035
03:22:10,420 --> 03:22:12,020
Uh

3036
03:22:12,020 --> 03:22:14,020
Over in the tunnel of love

3037
03:22:17,620 --> 03:22:23,300
Oh, jeez, where are they are they in oh god, you're all having to play on my ping

3038
03:22:25,060 --> 03:22:27,060
I'm so sorry

3039
03:22:27,940 --> 03:22:34,820
I'm so sorry the game's like nice and buttery smooth for me your game must be like skating on I

3040
03:22:38,900 --> 03:22:42,900
Yes, um, so I won't take up too long today because

3041
03:22:43,780 --> 03:22:48,260
It's either like long streams or they're here. They're here

3042
03:22:49,300 --> 03:22:51,300
it's either long streams or

3043
03:22:51,860 --> 03:22:57,620
In no like other content outside of streams or a wee bit shorter streams

3044
03:22:58,340 --> 03:23:00,580
But more content overall like I think

3045
03:23:01,380 --> 03:23:07,060
That'll hopefully help I in quotation mark. I'm not sure I just

3046
03:23:08,180 --> 03:23:09,220
Ah

3047
03:23:09,220 --> 03:23:10,740

3140
03:30:50,260 --> 03:30:53,300
No, actually, I want to play the humans because I actually don't even know what this thing is

3141
03:30:53,860 --> 03:30:58,260
I just want to make sure I've got everyone that wanted to play but we might have done it

3142
03:31:00,340 --> 03:31:05,780
That everyone that's active right so many of you appear offline. What's going on?

3143
03:31:06,340 --> 03:31:07,780
What you played maga

3144
03:31:07,780 --> 03:31:14,740
Calarium never heard of it team fortress to the fix the servers red m never heard of it satisfactory

3145
03:31:15,380 --> 03:31:17,780
blade and sorcery don't know that one

3146
03:31:18,500 --> 03:31:20,500
And then some of these are online

3147
03:31:21,460 --> 03:31:24,580
And some of these are offline shock and behavior shock and behavior

3148
03:31:25,540 --> 03:31:26,740
And

3149
03:31:26,740 --> 03:31:31,540
Okay, if that's everyone that wants in then yeah, you can stream snipe again. You can come back in

3150
03:31:32,420 --> 03:31:35,140
You can come back in I give you permission to come

3151
03:31:36,980 --> 03:31:40,980
I didn't get to bark because I got my make yoings honestly

3152
03:31:41,860 --> 03:31:43,860
a right duplicates are allowed

3153
03:31:44,980 --> 03:31:46,260
Star

3154
03:31:46,260 --> 03:31:48,260
Star yes

3155
03:31:49,620 --> 03:31:55,380
And then you play dark and when we come back to stream snipe for the game, um

3156
03:31:57,460 --> 03:32:03,380
We could go back to the very start if you want to I don't know

3157
03:32:05,860 --> 03:32:12,020
I don't I can't remember how many chapters there are if there's 10 was it 10 chapters

3158
03:32:12,740 --> 03:32:14,740
Um

3159
03:32:22,900 --> 03:32:27,620
It's for me on the other side of a fence as a charge I thought you guys would get away for this kind of a cover

3160
03:32:30,500 --> 03:32:35,860
Uh, yeah, we could start from the start and do it that you're with me for the full like chapter

3161
03:32:36,580 --> 03:32:40,260
But I feel like that's quite a lot versus like getting swapped out and going again

3162
03:32:41,140 --> 03:32:42,260
um

3163
03:32:42,260 --> 03:32:46,580
Your connections best you're gonna get kicked out the server. We are loading someone

3164
03:32:48,260 --> 03:32:50,260
Joining a versus game starring

3165
03:32:51,460 --> 03:32:52,980
Two moves

3166
03:32:52,980 --> 03:32:55,540
Not all the fun rules the latino world

3167
03:32:56,820 --> 03:33:00,260
There's 14 campaign no reason to do dead center and pass them again

3168
03:33:00,580 --> 03:33:05,140
Okay, so we've got we'll be able to wrap up in one stream snipe steam stream

3169
03:33:06,020 --> 03:33:07,620
night

3170
03:33:08,340 --> 03:33:10,340
That's not a problem at all

3171
03:33:10,580 --> 03:33:11,860
and

3172
03:33:11,860 --> 03:33:16,100
But if that's everyone then I'm happy to wrap up after this one

3173
03:33:17,220 --> 03:33:21,220
And then I'll get to work with my behind the scenes

3174
03:33:23,700 --> 03:33:25,700
Hello

3175
03:33:26,820 --> 03:33:28,820

Spooky what was that?

3179
03:33:41,860 --> 03:33:44,500
Is that an in-game voiceline or do one of you just call me sweetheart?

3180
03:33:45,940 --> 03:33:47,940
Am I going crazy?

3181
03:33:49,220 --> 03:33:52,740
How much did you sleep? I think I got like five

3182
03:33:55,220 --> 03:34:00,900
Uh, I'm not really sure what the deal is channeling

3183
03:34:01,860 --> 03:34:03,860

3186
03:34:16,260 --> 03:34:17,460
Stop

3187
03:34:17,460 --> 03:34:19,460
No way I'm dead already

3188
03:34:19,780 --> 03:34:24,820
Stop wait. Let me go back in that room. Let me go back in that room. There must be a gun in here that I need

3189
03:34:25,780 --> 03:34:32,820
Oh my god, right get at least put that on right. I'm healing myself up. I can't believe I'm such an idiot

3190
03:34:35,940 --> 03:34:38,340
I hear you creeping around on the roof

3191
03:34:39,700 --> 03:34:43,780
I hear you creeping around you're getting ready to jump me

3192
03:34:45,780 --> 03:34:48,580
Okay, like let's do it. Let's do it push push push

3193
03:34:49,140 --> 03:34:51,700
We have to push through or else we're gonna get new

3194
03:34:51,700 --> 03:34:53,700

3198
03:35:22,420 --> 03:35:25,140
Because they're gonna spawn I don't know where

3199
03:35:28,340 --> 03:35:30,340
They're coming though

3200
03:35:33,220 --> 03:35:36,820
Okay, come come come up up up into the little pit thing

3201
03:35:37,540 --> 03:35:41,300
The ping is hitting different. Yeah, you think the ping's a little bit spicy

3202
03:35:41,780 --> 03:35:45,540
I'm sorry about that. Yeah, you think it's just a wee bit spicy

3203
03:35:46,340 --> 03:35:50,420
I don't know. I don't think 306 ping is that bad honestly

3204
03:35:50,820 --> 03:35:57,220
No, I don't really see what the problem is in a multiplayer game that requires fast reaction time and wits and all of that

3205
03:35:57,780 --> 03:35:59,780
Yeah, no, I don't think it's that bad

3206
03:36:03,140 --> 03:36:05,140
Oh

3207
03:36:05,940 --> 03:36:07,940
Is there a chopper? There is

3208
03:36:08,740 --> 03:36:13,220
I'm reloading

3209
03:36:14,100 --> 03:36:16,100
I'm reloading

3210
03:36:16,500 --> 03:36:20,340
Bump bump bump bump bump bump. We're down already

3211
03:36:23,300 --> 03:36:25,780
Don't you spit on me. I heard that

3212
03:36:26,820 --> 03:36:31,220
I heard you do that. Oh my god. You spit on me while i'm down naughty

3213
03:36:32,260 --> 03:36:36,500
Bad bad get purged get purged get purged get purged

3214
03:36:38,900 --> 03:36:44,020
No way. No way we hardly got anywhere

3215
03:36:47,460 --> 03:36:49,460
We suck

3216
03:36:50,100 --> 03:36:53,860
We got no way. We didn't even make it to the 25% mark

3217
03:36:57,220 --> 03:37:00,020
Oh that was terrible that was terrible

3218
03:37:00,820 --> 03:37:02,820
Will we do a swap out?

3219
03:37:03,220 --> 03:37:05,460
Or will we continue that fell a bit rough?

3220
03:37:06,420 --> 03:37:09,940
I've done that fell a bit rough for the first players. I think maybe stay in

3221
03:37:10,660 --> 03:37:14,260
And then we'll finish this up since we're at the point where everyone's had to grow

3222
03:37:16,260 --> 03:37:20,500
So yeah, just stay just stay just stay. Yeah continue. Don't don't leave. Don't swap out

3223
03:37:22,740 --> 03:37:26,900
Oh, we're waiting on you. We're waiting on you to get out that room. I dare you

3224
03:37:27,860 --> 03:37:30,020
Mmm, I do I'm sorry

3228
03:37:49,460 --> 03:37:52,340
My name is strani cuttles and I will have my revenge

3238
03:38:29,620 --> 03:38:35,860
You're not supposed to stream snipe like that. You're only supposed to stream snipe the other way where you come on stream with me

3239
03:38:36,740 --> 03:38:40,260
You're not supposed to actually stream snipe my position

3240
03:38:40,980 --> 03:38:42,980
Don't cheesy doodle

3241
03:38:43,620 --> 03:38:45,620
That's cheesy doodlin

Ah, no, I don't have the HP. Okay. I did a few bits of hits. Okay

3247
03:39:13,300 --> 03:39:17,940
It's a few bits. It's like they can hear you or something. They're in the walls. How did they know?

3248
03:39:19,940 --> 03:39:22,180
Bro's head and perfect be hops is over

03:39:24,100 --> 03:39:26,260
Wait, are we actually against like mlg pro?

3250
03:39:26,500 --> 03:39:28,500
No way

03:39:31,140 --> 03:39:33,700
We can't see your health bar. It's really hard

3252
03:39:36,420 --> 03:39:38,420

Yeah

3257
03:40:00,020 --> 03:40:02,020
Okay

3258
03:40:04,180 --> 03:40:08,740
Wait, why is this map so hard both sides couldn't do it

3259
03:40:10,660 --> 03:40:12,900
It must be a difficult map. There's no way

3260
03:40:15,140 --> 03:40:17,460
Wait, oh, no, they're still up. No, you can't

3261

It must be a really hard part of the map

3263
03:40:26,660 --> 03:40:32,740
All right, well, we read some marshy malons. We do some marshy malons. They won by eight points. No, fuck you

Remove as friend. Oh, this is gonna take forever. This is what I do when I hate this screen

3277
03:41:25,300 --> 03:41:30,500
And it takes forever for me to do it at the end, but it's worth it because I get to play with you

3278
03:41:32,180 --> 03:41:33,540
Like

3279
03:41:33,540 --> 03:41:40,500

Isn't there an easier name? No, this was the easier way

3281
03:41:45,860 --> 03:41:48,020
This is the easier way. It takes me longer

3282
03:41:49,620 --> 03:41:53,460
Sorry, mama. I got you earlier because I heard your character gurgling

Experience that is lifted to I can't believe like I've managed to like

Manage remove his friend. My brain cannot do two things at once. I'll read some marshy mallows before I go

3302
03:43:05,380 --> 03:43:07,380
Obviously, um

3303
03:43:09,300 --> 03:43:12,420
I'm gonna have to investigate the in me situation a bit more

3304
03:43:14,500 --> 03:43:16,420
Uh

3305
03:43:16,420 --> 03:43:18,420
If you see that

3306
03:43:19,060 --> 03:43:22,420
You know ASMR is deleted and all that. Please don't be surprised

3307
03:43:24,580 --> 03:43:29,460
Yeah, you enjoyed it. Well, I'll see about it wrapping it up this month

3308
03:43:29,460 --> 03:43:34,740
I think I'll swap out a boring game and then we'll do a full day stream sniping on this game. Um

3309
03:43:35,860 --> 03:43:40,980
Not that the games I pick are born not to say anything about the other games. Um, but

3310
03:43:41,620 --> 03:43:43,620
How the fuck

3311
03:43:43,940 --> 03:43:45,940
Right

3312
03:43:46,260 --> 03:43:51,060
Thank you. I leave you vast as well for the tip. Um, no, I'm glad you had fun. Well

3313
03:43:52,260 --> 03:43:56,260
Dude, that is a really good stream snip game. Obviously elden ring was a big stream snip game

3314
03:43:56,260 --> 03:43:59,380
but that came with a hefty fucking price tag like that was

3315
03:44:00,020 --> 03:44:01,540
um

3316
03:44:01,540 --> 03:44:03,540
like a big

3317
03:44:06,580 --> 03:44:08,580
Price tag that came with that one

3318
03:44:09,540 --> 03:44:15,780
Um, uh, whereas I think life for dead. I'm gonna hope that it's cheaper, right?

3319
03:44:16,580 --> 03:44:22,100
Surely surely life for dead in general is cheaper, right?

3320
03:44:23,620 --> 03:44:25,220
Right

3321
03:44:25,220 --> 03:44:27,220
Because it's so old

3322
03:44:27,220 --> 03:44:29,220
and ancient

3323
03:44:31,300 --> 03:44:33,300
Okay

3324
03:44:33,780 --> 03:44:35,780
She has the um

3325
03:44:36,660 --> 03:44:38,660
Oh

3326
03:44:38,740 --> 03:44:40,740
Did emmy say

3327
03:44:42,020 --> 03:44:44,020
Okay, if emmy said it then

3328
03:44:45,300 --> 03:44:46,900
I am very

3329
03:44:46,900 --> 03:44:48,900
on tentative hooks

3330
03:44:49,060 --> 03:44:52,340
Right now. Um, I am very

3331
03:44:55,380 --> 03:44:57,380
To put a long story short

3332
03:44:58,660 --> 03:45:01,540
We were getting prepared to create a new account

3333
03:45:02,340 --> 03:45:08,340
It's like three dollars on sale. Okay. There you go. Yeah, she tweeted. Okay to put a long story short

3334
03:45:08,420 --> 03:45:12,900
Uh, we were getting prepared to create a new account. So that was very surprised

3335
03:45:12,900 --> 03:45:14,420
How does it

3336
03:45:15,700 --> 03:45:17,700
Um

3337
03:45:18,420 --> 03:45:19,780
But

3338
03:45:19,780 --> 03:45:26,260
Obviously I am over the moon at the result. I'm just very surprised

3339
03:45:27,220 --> 03:45:34,660
Because of some other stuff, but I mean fuck who am I? Fuck it. I'm joining you on team fortress too

3340
03:45:35,620 --> 03:45:37,940
Uh, manage remove his friend

3341
03:45:40,180 --> 03:45:42,740
Manage remove his friend

3342
03:45:43,860 --> 03:45:47,460
And then okay, let me just check that no one's like

3343
03:45:49,460 --> 03:45:52,980
There's not like anything that could hate it or anything like that. Yeah

3344
03:45:53,700 --> 03:45:57,060
What's fun facing the zombie apocalypse with you. Yeah

3345
03:46:03,140 --> 03:46:05,620
It's over. It's absolutely over for us

3346
03:46:06,260 --> 03:46:07,700
We're goners

3347
03:46:07,700 --> 03:46:09,700
Thank you reluctantly saying for the tip

3348
03:46:10,020 --> 03:46:14,820
Emmy prayers came true. I had a good feel in her channel would return emmy showing everyone why she's a necromancer

3349
03:46:15,300 --> 03:46:17,300
and raising herself from the dead

3350
03:46:17,700 --> 03:46:20,340
Well, emmy is the god damn magical ties

3351
03:46:20,740 --> 03:46:22,740
Is

3352
03:46:22,900 --> 03:46:28,340
Is that what the panic was at the start of the stream? I did not know emmy's account was restored

3353
03:46:28,820 --> 03:46:34,420
I basically ran through to my other pc and deleted all of her asmr content. Um

3354
03:46:35,380 --> 03:46:39,940
And what will happen is once there's no strike on her channel

3355
03:46:40,580 --> 03:46:46,260
I'm sure she will agree to this. I'm sure the pin pals are more than happy. How the fuck did you do that?

3356
03:46:47,140 --> 03:46:49,140
Oh

3357
03:46:52,820 --> 03:46:59,700
How did that did I know how did you do that? How did that work? What happened?

3358
03:47:02,020 --> 03:47:08,100
Uh, thank you colker for the 10 gifted memberships as well. Congrats. So there's a cut over your face. Please enjoy them

3359
03:47:09,220 --> 03:47:12,980
Hey, all that thing just don't stand in front of mommy when she's covered in bail

3360
03:47:13,140 --> 03:47:20,420
Uh, she shoots everything. Yeah, basically. Was the internet possible?

3361
03:47:21,860 --> 03:47:26,980
I'm green as a big bro. I'm really happy. Yes. I am bloody happy too

3362
03:47:27,940 --> 03:47:30,740
I forgot to mention the game has a special aspect each special

3363
03:47:30,740 --> 03:47:35,940
In fact, it has its own creepy musical tune if you can't see them or hear them the tune kind of gives them a

3364
03:47:36,580 --> 03:47:41,860
Oh, I've got the music like turned way down in my head. So I'm so sorry. I probably missed that

3365
03:47:43,140 --> 03:47:45,220
This game has a special aspect to it

3366
03:47:45,700 --> 03:47:51,220
Each special infected has its own creepy musical tune if you can't see them or hear them

3367
03:47:51,380 --> 03:47:53,380
The tune kind of gives them away

3368
03:47:53,540 --> 03:47:58,420
Like I said, youtube did a system restore a week ago and some channels got revived again

3369
03:47:58,500 --> 03:48:05,540
YouTube just crashed and reversed the code. That doesn't explain why the rat strike was removed. So youtube denied it

3370
03:48:06,820 --> 03:48:08,820
which is

3371
03:48:08,980 --> 03:48:10,660
I um

3372
03:48:10,740 --> 03:48:12,740
I am very I am nervous

3373
03:48:13,780 --> 03:48:15,780
I'm nervous

3374
03:48:16,820 --> 03:48:20,900
I still have you as a friend on the chosen one. How have I not?

3375
03:48:21,700 --> 03:48:24,580
Can you unfriend me? How do I like

3376
03:48:25,860 --> 03:48:27,860
Open up your profile and unfriend you

3377
03:48:30,340 --> 03:48:32,340
I don't get it. I can't see you

3378
03:48:32,420 --> 03:48:34,420
I

3379
03:48:35,940 --> 03:48:41,620
What the fuck I don't know how you're doing get the fucking I don't know how you're doing that

3380
03:48:41,940 --> 03:48:47,940
Thank you for not sending a really inappropriate message because that could have gone fucking crazy. Right. So does that mean

3381
03:48:49,780 --> 03:48:52,180
Is that I still says friend play in?

3382
03:48:55,300 --> 03:48:57,460
No, right, okay, it's gone. There we go

3383
03:48:58,020 --> 03:49:04,980
YouTube felt the power of grace and realized we're wrong quite and check again. Yeah, it looks like that's everyone now

3384
03:49:08,340 --> 03:49:12,020
I thank you for not putting something wildly inappropriate because uh, yeah

3385
03:49:13,220 --> 03:49:15,380
No, I'm not adding any more. No

3386
03:49:16,420 --> 03:49:18,180
Nope, you don't

3387
03:49:18,180 --> 03:49:20,740
No stream snake. There's no game. We're not playing game

3388
03:49:21,860 --> 03:49:22,820
uh

3389
03:49:22,820 --> 03:49:24,420
Yes, I

3390
03:49:24,500 --> 03:49:30,260
I don't want to celebrate prematurely. I don't know why the rat sniff was removed

3391
03:49:31,380 --> 03:49:32,500
and

3392
03:49:32,500 --> 03:49:39,700
obviously when we realized the account was up, obviously fucking shivy was being chaining and I fucking ran through to

3393
03:49:40,020 --> 03:49:42,180
delete all of the ASMR real quick

3394
03:49:42,980 --> 03:49:44,180
um

3395
03:49:44,180 --> 03:49:46,180
I suspect someone so

3396
03:49:46,740 --> 03:49:50,180
If we're if we want if we want to talk about it, I'm happy to talk about it

3397
03:49:50,820 --> 03:49:52,500
Amy I

3398
03:49:52,500 --> 03:49:54,180
asked Amy

3399
03:49:54,180 --> 03:49:59,300
When that rap band first happened to please reach out to youtube on twitter and I told her what to put and she did it

3400
03:49:59,940 --> 03:50:04,100
Um, but we never got help because she never did the appeal at that point

3401
03:50:04,980 --> 03:50:10,420
But it got denied and then she never asked for further help. I'm wondering if that

3402
03:50:11,060 --> 03:50:12,020
some

3403
03:50:12,020 --> 03:50:13,060
how

3404
03:50:13,060 --> 03:50:16,020
kicked in because of the server reset thing

3405
03:50:16,660 --> 03:50:22,420
And it did get taken off even though on twitter they were like not worth anything at all

3406
03:50:23,380 --> 03:50:26,740
Um, I just don't want to celebrate prematurely

3407
03:50:27,140 --> 03:50:31,460
But as I said all the ASMR has been removed. Everything else is above board. Um

3408
03:50:32,740 --> 03:50:34,740
As far as I can tell and

3409
03:50:34,980 --> 03:50:39,060
Once that warning is gone. I'm more than happy for her to do ASMRs again

3410
03:50:39,060 --> 03:50:44,260
I am not for baiting before anyone's like you're for baiting a talent to do one thing but everyone else can do the other

3411
03:50:44,580 --> 03:50:50,020
Motherfucker, please be realistic the account just got taken away. We've been giving it back. This is our second chance

3412
03:50:50,020 --> 03:50:52,020
Do not fuck up that second chance

3413
03:50:52,180 --> 03:50:54,180
um

3414
03:50:54,340 --> 03:50:56,340
I

3415
03:50:57,700 --> 03:51:03,060
I'm very happy that the account is back, but I I just I don't think I'll feel

3416
03:51:03,700 --> 03:51:07,780
secure until like a couple of weeks have passed and all honestly, you know

3417
03:51:09,300 --> 03:51:15,780
Uh, maybe maybe our payment. I mean shit. Can you do memberships again? Hold on a minute. Can you do memberships?

3418
03:51:18,580 --> 03:51:20,820
Or does it need to be re-enabled again?

3419
03:51:22,660 --> 03:51:29,780
Oh, that's scary her profile picture doesn't load for me when I straight when I search my name. No the join button's back

3420
03:51:34,900 --> 03:51:36,900
What

3421
03:51:40,260 --> 03:51:45,780
The thumbnail for her 30k celebration screen isn't loading for me. What's that mean?

3422
03:51:45,780 --> 03:51:47,780
Oh

3423
03:51:50,340 --> 03:51:52,340
What does it mean? I don't know

3424
03:51:57,940 --> 03:52:03,140
Why is her stream chained together? I just farted and it smells like eggs. Why would you call it that?

3425
03:52:03,540 --> 03:52:05,540
And then why would you call it that?

3426
03:52:06,900 --> 03:52:09,540
I'm a member so it's okay membership is back

3427
03:52:10,260 --> 03:52:16,580
That's a good sign. All right. That's a immaculately good sign

3428
03:52:19,220 --> 03:52:23,380
Oh reeflings, I can't believe that hold on speaking of smelling eggs

3429
03:52:28,900 --> 03:52:30,900
That was the world's quietest egg

3430
03:52:31,140 --> 03:52:36,500
Management here. What oh for fuck's sake. I thought you were in me management for your her

3431
03:52:37,220 --> 03:52:40,660
Her channel is fully functional and monetization is enabled

3432
03:52:41,460 --> 03:52:47,060
Skin walking is emmy discussed and go here. Don't ever type in this chat again unless you are the real

3433
03:52:47,940 --> 03:52:51,620
Mab soup someone called her b soup and I absolutely loved it

3434
03:52:53,140 --> 03:52:56,340
Okay, thank you management. I appreciate that that

3435
03:52:57,300 --> 03:53:02,580
As I said, I still feel very tentative. I'm like, I mean, but if the strike isn't there

3436
03:53:03,220 --> 03:53:07,540
Them's the facts. The strike is no longer there. So thems is the facts

3437
03:53:08,260 --> 03:53:10,260
You know

3438
03:53:10,420 --> 03:53:15,620
Uh rushy roue rushy roue. I'm so sorry rushy roue

3439
03:53:16,340 --> 03:53:17,460
Ryu

3440
03:53:17,460 --> 03:53:23,220
Thank you for the membership. Hope you enjoyed that most my sister became a bro. Nice. No, don't celebrate

3441
03:53:24,420 --> 03:53:26,420
Don't celebrate that in her

3442
03:53:27,620 --> 03:53:29,620
Don't celebrate skin walking

3443
03:53:30,420 --> 03:53:34,340
Right, okay, let's get right into the news

3444
03:53:36,020 --> 03:53:43,380
You should either revise the AI. That's what my brain is now thinking why they had to resort to turn code

3445
03:53:44,340 --> 03:53:46,340
Is the AI filter?

3446
03:53:47,460 --> 03:53:51,860
That's what my brain is currently trying to calibrate and say is that logical to assume

3447
03:53:51,860 --> 03:53:57,780
They might have tried to update the AI filter recently that um watches over the content

3448
03:53:58,580 --> 03:54:02,900
She still has a six day wait. However before she can stream upload and post

3449
03:54:03,460 --> 03:54:05,460
So that's acting like a strike one

3450
03:54:06,820 --> 03:54:12,180
So there is no official strike two anymore. She's just a straight one. What the fuck is going on?

3451
03:54:12,900 --> 03:54:17,620
I'll do some invest in my gating. Thank you management. I'll do some invest in my gating

3452
03:54:19,460 --> 03:54:25,220
So there's now no strike two on emmy and it's now now the

3453
03:54:26,180 --> 03:54:30,660
The collab a some arm video has been treated like her strike one

3454
03:54:32,340 --> 03:54:39,060
That's bizarre. So the gummy worms are now her official strike the rats breathing in the mic are not the strike

3455
03:54:40,740 --> 03:54:45,700
A six day wait is better than 13. It's a hell of a lot better than fucking rebuilding as well

3456
03:54:46,340 --> 03:54:48,660
I think we can all celebrate that one my darlin

3457
03:54:49,620 --> 03:54:52,740
My darlin riflin. I think we can all celebrate a six day wait

3458
03:54:56,180 --> 03:54:58,180
Uh

3459
03:54:58,740 --> 03:55:01,240
Wow, that is very curious

3460
03:55:02,180 --> 03:55:03,620
is it

3461
03:55:03,620 --> 03:55:08,580
As I said, I'm trying to just not get too in over my head and celebrate because I

3462
03:55:09,300 --> 03:55:11,860
That I just don't understand what on earth

3463
03:55:12,980 --> 03:55:14,420
changed

3464
03:55:14,420 --> 03:55:18,980
Twitter's youtube support on twitter said not the rat breathing. It's still getting a strike

3465
03:55:19,940 --> 03:55:26,820
We contacted youtube's partnership chat and they were like we know that this is a rat breathing on the mic

3466
03:55:27,220 --> 03:55:31,380
Um, but you're still gonna get a strike because we take all the channel's content into consideration

3467
03:55:31,460 --> 03:55:36,660
And it's like no if you're gonna give a strike for something aim it don't just shotgun blast it

3468
03:55:38,340 --> 03:55:40,340
Oh, right

3469
03:55:41,620 --> 03:55:44,260
You should didn't want to deal with the rat sniffing allegations. Yeah

3470
03:55:44,500 --> 03:55:45,500
I

3471
03:55:45,500 --> 03:55:50,740
Keep expectations low but hope up. Yes. Sorry. I sorry if I sound so doom and gloomy at the end of this

3472
03:55:50,980 --> 03:55:53,540
I'm not doom and gloom. I'm just shocked

3473
03:55:54,500 --> 03:55:56,500
Okay

3474
03:55:56,580 --> 03:55:58,580
Hey

3475
03:56:01,140 --> 03:56:06,260
Um, hello mommy. I wish I had left for dead too so I could join you join and bark for you

3476
03:56:06,740 --> 03:56:10,500
Maybe ruflin's, please have some hugs and kisses. Yeah, I can give you kisses

3477
03:56:10,820 --> 03:56:16,580
Hmm, are you gonna keep streaming? No, no, don't redirect into me. No, don't redirect into me

3478
03:56:17,220 --> 03:56:20,900
I'm out. I'm out. I'm reading marshmallows and I'm out. Don't redirect into me

3479
03:56:23,780 --> 03:56:25,780
I'm out very shortly

3480
03:56:26,020 --> 03:56:30,260
Uh, I can't give a hug on this microphone because you can't hear it, but I can give kisses

3481
03:56:34,260 --> 03:56:36,260
Thank you for working hard

3482
03:56:40,900 --> 03:56:42,900
Is a zero

3483
03:56:47,780 --> 03:56:56,260
I'm sorry if I didn't bark vigorously enough. No, I have housemates and felt embarrassed. I'll be a good boy and do better

3484
03:56:57,220 --> 03:57:04,340
Oh my god, that's so fun. I love you story. I love you too ruflin so glad to play and talk to you. Yeah, it was a fun

3485
03:57:05,220 --> 03:57:10,340
Hey, mommy, thanks for playing this game with us ruflin's and she maybe a monthly play for this game

3486
03:57:11,060 --> 03:57:16,260
Anyway, there's a lot of tips and tricks you can do in the game like hunter pinball tower punching to instant kill survivor

3487
03:57:18,020 --> 03:57:23,460
I'm about to go get off. I was saying about a harem and got caught up. No, no, no, I do that

3488
03:57:23,540 --> 03:57:28,100
So let's all have a yeah at the end of a good stream. Yeah, we can have a big yeah

3489
03:57:29,700 --> 03:57:31,300
um

3490
03:57:31,300 --> 03:57:37,220
Also making 11 shorts. Let's hope one goes viral. That's what I'm hoping as well. Um

3491
03:57:38,180 --> 03:57:44,500
Some of them, I think three of them have potential to get a bit of traction. Um

3492
03:57:45,540 --> 03:57:49,460
I'm gonna get them all edited before I start uploading them because

3493
03:57:49,940 --> 03:57:53,380
If you upload live content like a highlight from a stream, it never does as good

3494
03:57:53,460 --> 03:57:57,860
But if you do pre-recorded it does quite well like it's never been seen before

3495
03:57:58,740 --> 03:58:03,860
Okay, a new make just to stream for the next time the stream that is so cute

3496
03:58:03,940 --> 03:58:08,180
No, you don't have to purchase a new make as long as you can talk through it

3497
03:58:10,980 --> 03:58:14,980
So they admit that if you do something wrong once they put a target on you based on past off

3498
03:58:16,020 --> 03:58:19,380
I don't it's very hard. So basically

3499
03:58:20,020 --> 03:58:24,660
We were asking youtube like hey, can you go one step further and say what's wrong? And they said

3500
03:58:25,380 --> 03:58:30,500
We can't tell you because you'll use it to skirt the rules and it was like no motherfucker

3501
03:58:30,580 --> 03:58:33,380
We don't know what the rules are you're not telling us

3502
03:58:33,860 --> 03:58:35,300
I am

3503
03:58:35,300 --> 03:58:39,780
Short and short and short. Thank you for today's stream moment even though you stream quite early for me

3504
03:58:39,860 --> 03:58:44,660
Yeah, 4 a.m. Early. I believe that you bring joy to my quiet nights and mornings

3505
03:58:44,740 --> 03:58:50,820
I appreciate the things you did for us and your gen mates. Oh darling. I know the fellow reeflings would say the same

3506
03:58:50,900 --> 03:58:54,660
I'll hope you take care of yourself. I hope you have a good rest your day to love you. I love you too

3507
03:58:55,300 --> 03:58:57,300
I'm so glad you could enjoy it

3508
03:58:57,540 --> 03:58:59,540
And I can keep you company

3509
03:59:00,580 --> 03:59:02,580
Mommy keep me company

3510
03:59:03,540 --> 03:59:07,940
La la la la la la la la la la la. Thank you for the three extended memberships

3511
03:59:08,260 --> 03:59:12,420
Three months extended membership three months already. Our baby's flying so big

3512
03:59:12,980 --> 03:59:15,460
Skirt the rules you want to know the rule. Yeah, that's what they say

3513
03:59:15,460 --> 03:59:19,140
They're like, we're not going to tell you because you're going to skirt the rules and it was like, what are you talking about?

3514
03:59:19,140 --> 03:59:23,540
We don't even know what we did wrong. It was a rat sniffing a microphone like at least fucking aim

3515
03:59:24,180 --> 03:59:27,620
Aim at something if you're going to give a strike at least aim at something

3516
03:59:28,580 --> 03:59:32,260
I know each of her channel got absolutely ruined because their shorts went hyper viral

3517
03:59:32,260 --> 03:59:34,900
And that ruined her channel metrics and how the algorithm works

3518
03:59:35,540 --> 03:59:37,700
Mm. Monk is starting to enter that

3519
03:59:38,580 --> 03:59:42,500
Actually, no, I'm gatekeeping myself. Fuck it. Yeah, fucking obliterate my channel

3520
03:59:44,980 --> 03:59:48,660
No, alessandro. Thank you for the extended three months membership

3521
03:59:49,460 --> 03:59:57,460
How big what happens what happens at three months of pregnancy to the embryo?

3522
03:59:58,580 --> 04:00:02,820
Or is it a fetus? Is it a fetus? Okay, it's a fetus. Sorry

3523
04:00:03,460 --> 04:00:08,500
The third month of pregnancy is when an embryo becomes a fetus. Okay, let me change my phrase then

3524
04:00:09,060 --> 04:00:11,060
Skin and fingernails begin to grow

3525
04:00:12,020 --> 04:00:16,020
Changes triggered by hormones begin to make external sex organs appear

3526
04:00:16,580 --> 04:00:21,540
Female or male the fetus begins making spontaneous movement and the kidney starts making urine

3527
04:00:22,260 --> 04:00:24,260
So it's filling his lung blood. I'm curious

3528
04:00:24,660 --> 04:00:26,660
All things filling with blood

3529
04:00:28,020 --> 04:00:30,020
You're at 26,000 subs

3530
04:00:30,420 --> 04:00:32,180
Better not be

3531
04:00:32,180 --> 04:00:38,180
I've still have a deficit of ASMR. Actually, I'm doing a membership script writing stream

3532
04:00:38,740 --> 04:00:41,620
Next month next month next week

3533
04:00:42,500 --> 04:00:45,620
I have so much content to discuss with you

3534
04:00:46,980 --> 04:00:48,980
Because I need to plan ahead

3535
04:00:50,980 --> 04:00:54,180
So that's going to be a big stream. We're all need to put our heads together

3536
04:00:54,580 --> 04:00:58,340
Reluctantly saying thank you for growing fingernails for our baby

3537
04:00:59,620 --> 04:01:05,940
Um, we say three months of enjoying this glorious goober and the most comfy community creed hell. Yeah, we've been blessed

3538
04:01:06,180 --> 04:01:07,380
Amen

3539
04:01:07,380 --> 04:01:09,380
Right, congrats on 26k. Thank you

3540
04:01:09,940 --> 04:01:12,660
Roondi isolation. Thank you for the extended three month membership

3541
04:01:13,060 --> 04:01:18,420
Already three months so much love and laughter shared and hoping for much more of the same in the future. Oh, yeah

3542
04:01:21,140 --> 04:01:23,220
Still talking about that ASMR debt, you know

3543
04:01:23,940 --> 04:01:29,220
I think I'll be more motivated to make it up when you guys dictate what you want like when you say like I want this

3544
04:01:29,220 --> 04:01:34,580
I want that I think I'll be a lot happier. Thank you sleepy phoenix for the uh extended three months

3545
04:01:36,340 --> 04:01:39,220
Since I didn't get to ingame bark bark

3546
04:01:44,820 --> 04:01:50,580
So are we green now you're always green our theme is green for the green game

3547
04:01:53,380 --> 04:01:55,380
Oh

3548
04:01:55,620 --> 04:01:57,220
Mummy does this

3549
04:01:57,220 --> 04:01:59,780
All the girls will stop to make ASMR or just any

3550
04:02:00,260 --> 04:02:06,340
Uh, I think what the policy is that we are enacting a new policy at velour headquarters

3551
04:02:06,820 --> 04:02:12,100
Oh, my fellow Americans. Um, I think if there's someone with an active war strike

3552
04:02:13,140 --> 04:02:16,580
ASMR is paused if it's someone has an active warning

3553
04:02:18,500 --> 04:02:19,860
Then

3554
04:02:19,860 --> 04:02:21,860
You know do what you do

3555
04:02:21,860 --> 04:02:25,860
Scarecrow damn. Thank you for the three months extended members

3556
04:02:27,140 --> 04:02:28,180
Directly

3557
04:02:28,180 --> 04:02:30,660
There direct again karma

3558
04:02:31,220 --> 04:02:32,420
Directly

3559
04:02:32,420 --> 04:02:38,020
Why are we fucking supposed to say three months and so much has already happened as reeflings are truly blessed to have your

3560
04:02:38,580 --> 04:02:40,580
Love your mummy also bark

3561
04:02:42,340 --> 04:02:44,340
We become pink in november, I think

3562
04:02:45,300 --> 04:02:47,300
Yeah, you get your new shell

3563
04:02:47,700 --> 04:02:56,100
Zero thanks for the three months as well. Is this my monetization date? It must be or else. However, you've become members

3564
04:02:57,060 --> 04:02:59,060
I remember

3565
04:02:59,460 --> 04:03:01,780
I remember. Thank you zero

3566
04:03:02,900 --> 04:03:06,900
Couldn't have asked for anything more love. Yeah. Love you to refland

3567
04:03:07,780 --> 04:03:12,260
It's a strong dictatorship literally. Yeah, I'll discuss with the girls what they feel

3568
04:03:12,500 --> 04:03:18,100
Um, I know mersi's a bit scared of doing ASMR streams, which adds any bloomers to be honest that the fucking

3569
04:03:18,500 --> 04:03:19,940
late night and so on

3570
04:03:19,940 --> 04:03:26,100
And there was another vtuber called lea kitty that got a fucking live stream removed because she blew down the make

3571
04:03:26,820 --> 04:03:27,780
which

3572
04:03:27,780 --> 04:03:29,620
maybe

3573
04:03:29,620 --> 04:03:33,380
Maybe these code and things maybe the ai getting changed but it's breaking

3574
04:03:34,420 --> 04:03:36,420
And I can't eat some more

3575
04:03:37,380 --> 04:03:41,700
Hmm plausible very plausible actually. Um

3576
04:03:42,580 --> 04:03:48,020
I wouldn't recommend it for anyone that has a warning. No a a warning or uh strike

3577
04:03:48,900 --> 04:03:53,460
Thanks for the game mom. It's it was fun to play left for dead again

3578
04:03:53,460 --> 04:04:00,020
It really brings back memories of playing at cyber cafes after school with the homies really you go to cyber cafes

3579
04:04:00,820 --> 04:04:02,820
I wonder what it was like

3580
04:04:03,060 --> 04:04:09,380
Strony molestia cyber cafes marwin who said that you said that a bit too quick. That was a bit too quick

3581
04:04:10,020 --> 04:04:14,900
Gigi strony. Thank you for the game looking forward to those shorts coming out. Yes. I'm looking forward to them

3582
04:04:15,220 --> 04:04:18,340
So I'm sending off 10 of them

3583
04:04:19,860 --> 04:04:22,820
And then there's one that needs to be recorded on the ASMR microphone

3584
04:04:23,140 --> 04:04:27,140
But I can't do it now because the birds are tweeting so no ASMR mic pumping

3585
04:04:28,260 --> 04:04:30,260
I wanted to do that so badly

3586
04:04:31,220 --> 04:04:36,180
Mmm, I came the one to do it like really fucking bad blue

3587
04:04:39,060 --> 04:04:43,700
I was hoping to get a riefling plushie and then I put the microphone in front of your

3588
04:04:44,500 --> 04:04:48,100
tentacles and I was gonna record it and

3589
04:04:49,220 --> 04:04:53,140
Yeah, I think I'll just straight up make that old twitter content

3590
04:04:54,660 --> 04:04:57,460
Isn't your warning gone in a couple of days? Yes, it is

3591
04:04:58,420 --> 04:05:05,780
On the 19th, I no longer have a warning and a week later. I'm doing tanga ASMR. I said what I said

3592
04:05:06,340 --> 04:05:11,700
I'll be taking no questions. I said what I said and I'm going to try and reupload the clap

3593
04:05:12,260 --> 04:05:14,260
because it was just the

3594
04:05:14,580 --> 04:05:16,980
Strony gets band speed running after Amy just got her channel back

3595
04:05:18,180 --> 04:05:19,940
room

3596
04:05:19,940 --> 04:05:21,940
Pumping only one week left

3597
04:05:22,820 --> 04:05:24,820
Pumping louder

3598
04:05:25,060 --> 04:05:28,740
Hello moma. Thank you for letting me play with you so much when I can't wait till the next left or dead

3599
04:05:28,900 --> 04:05:31,700
Yes, we're going to have a full day of left or dead stream sniping

3600
04:05:36,500 --> 04:05:41,620
Wait, well the plan was going well soon thought the riefling I'll be able to duck away

3601
04:05:41,780 --> 04:05:43,780
He barked but it took

3602
04:05:44,020 --> 04:05:48,420
Encouragement the riefling saw Strony watch him with her unusual pupils

3603
04:05:48,900 --> 04:05:50,500
Sometimes it seemed

3604
04:05:50,500 --> 04:05:55,940
She could see inside him. He loved her very much, but it was a little unnerving to think his thoughts were

3605
04:05:57,140 --> 04:05:58,500
Might be laid

3606
04:05:58,500 --> 04:06:00,180
Bear so easily

3607
04:06:00,180 --> 04:06:04,020
He saw her pupils change and his vision dipped and swam suddenly he was gone

3608
04:06:04,420 --> 04:06:08,740
Oh, she suddenly she was gone. Please get some good rest tonight. I will

3609
04:06:08,900 --> 04:06:11,940
We love you so much and want you live a good lifestyle

3610
04:06:12,580 --> 04:06:14,500
Love them

3611
04:06:14,500 --> 04:06:16,500
Thank you so much mb bucket

3612
04:06:17,460 --> 04:06:20,500
And thank you for the tip. I promise I'm looking after myself

3613
04:06:20,740 --> 04:06:21,860
as I said

3614
04:06:21,860 --> 04:06:28,420
I had what was known as a selfish day yesterday and a selfish day means I work on my own content basically

3615
04:06:29,540 --> 04:06:31,140
um

3616
04:06:31,140 --> 04:06:33,140
Only just got back love you moma. I'll be too

3617
04:06:34,020 --> 04:06:38,580
Hey, I'm just reading marshmallows and then we're gonna redirect into a zero

3618
04:06:39,780 --> 04:06:45,380
I think I know as there's not up. Yes, you're getting redirected into a stream. That's just shellfish

3619
04:06:45,780 --> 04:06:47,780
I'm so shellfish, honestly

3620
04:06:48,020 --> 04:06:48,980
um

3621
04:06:48,980 --> 04:06:50,980
Saw her pupils change and his vision

3622
04:06:51,220 --> 04:06:55,780
Uh dipped and swam suddenly she was gone. He blinked. What happened? Where did she go?

3623
04:06:56,180 --> 04:06:59,220
strongy's voice from close practically right next to his ear

3624
04:06:59,620 --> 04:07:04,180
Revealing she said in her soft sultry scottish tone

3625
04:07:04,900 --> 04:07:09,380
Do you need a little more time on stage to shake your shyness?

3626
04:07:10,100 --> 04:07:16,340
He broke out in a cold sweat as her rifle slid towards the cans painstakingly collected

3627
04:07:16,740 --> 04:07:19,620
He couldn't move couldn't stop her if he wanted to

3628
04:07:20,420 --> 04:07:22,420
I think it can be arranged

3629
04:07:22,740 --> 04:07:30,580
I think it can be arranged. She said with a soft chuckle the rifle barked and a plume of flame

3630
04:07:31,300 --> 04:07:38,740
Billowed out consuming each in a firework the roar of the fire in her chuckle and said what what is what was that story about?

3631
04:07:39,380 --> 04:07:41,380
I

3632
04:07:42,260 --> 04:07:44,260
I'm not sure

3633
04:07:45,460 --> 04:07:47,460
Uh

3634
04:07:49,220 --> 04:07:51,220
You're back you're back you're back

3635
04:07:53,060 --> 04:07:55,060
Hi, did you not know I'm back?

3636
04:07:56,500 --> 04:08:00,020
Long time no see miss me. I missed you

3637
04:08:02,100 --> 04:08:05,140
Is that left for dead to fanfic? I'm not sure what that was

3638
04:08:05,780 --> 04:08:07,140
Cause

3639
04:08:07,140 --> 04:08:09,460
Causing you to redo the map with a shy refund

3640
04:08:10,180 --> 04:08:16,020
Selfish they working on shorts for refunds. You have a funny definition. No, I think it's selfish

3641
04:08:16,980 --> 04:08:18,420
If I don't

3642
04:08:18,420 --> 04:08:24,900
Like do work for the girls in the background like something they plan something they want. I consider it selfish

3643
04:08:25,540 --> 04:08:29,300
Guess who's back back back back again again

3644
04:08:30,100 --> 04:08:32,100
strongy's back back back

3645
04:08:32,420 --> 04:08:39,220
Tell a friend friend friend. Yes, who's back. Yes, who's back. Yes, who's back. Yes, who's back

3646
04:08:39,620 --> 04:08:40,980
Manine

3647
04:08:40,980 --> 04:08:46,180
Did the word refling all correct to rifle is the rifle supposed to be the use of this one?

3648
04:08:49,540 --> 04:08:50,660
A

3649
04:08:50,660 --> 04:08:56,260
Hi, mommy. I think it would be cool if you or the community did some sort of mensman in health awareness charity month third

3650
04:08:56,340 --> 04:09:00,980
No, don't say that. I'm loud already have a plan to be quiet refling

3651
04:09:00,980 --> 04:09:02,980
You're ruining my plans

3652
04:09:03,620 --> 04:09:05,620
You're ruining it

3653
04:09:06,420 --> 04:09:10,820
You're ruining my plans refling. There's already something being planned

3654
04:09:11,460 --> 04:09:16,660
Stop it. You're ruining the secret. You're not even in fucking management

3655
04:09:17,460 --> 04:09:24,180
I'm not even wrote down and told the girls the plan yet. You're ruining it. Stop it

3656
04:09:27,620 --> 04:09:29,620
You're ruining it

3657
04:09:29,700 --> 04:09:33,860
Can I be so bold to ask on the sass for the twitter pictures? Yes

3658
04:09:34,900 --> 04:09:41,620
Yes, I've been such a well behaved inkling. Oh, that's so cute. Yes. Um, I hope to have

3659
04:09:42,340 --> 04:09:45,540
Your call their photos up by the end of today

3660
04:09:45,940 --> 04:09:51,060
No, I please I do apologize for anyone that waits for anything on the old twitter

3661
04:09:51,860 --> 04:09:53,060
I try very hard

3662
04:09:53,060 --> 04:09:56,500
But as you can imagine with the situation made me channel yesterday

3663
04:09:56,980 --> 04:09:58,980
The last thing I felt like doing was

3664
04:10:01,140 --> 04:10:03,140
You know taking off my armor

3665
04:10:03,220 --> 04:10:08,100
Um and posing with your caller that was kind of the last thing on my mind. So, um

3666
04:10:08,900 --> 04:10:12,900
Wait, you don't have your caller on now. No, you have to tell me if you want it on on streaming

3667
04:10:13,860 --> 04:10:16,740
Do you want to start doing that? I mean, I'm down to do that

3668
04:10:16,820 --> 04:10:21,140
If we if we start a stream and then you tell me put on a fucking down for that

3669
04:10:21,620 --> 04:10:23,620
Ha ha

3670
04:10:23,940 --> 04:10:27,540
No worries. We know you're busy. Yes, I'm going to aim to have it done

3671
04:10:27,620 --> 04:10:30,740
But if I don't have it done, please no, I'm probably doing a shit ton of stuff

3672
04:10:32,420 --> 04:10:38,020
Mommy, how goes the figure delivery? I've not heard any updates from it since what they do is they make it

3673
04:10:38,740 --> 04:10:43,380
When to order order. Fuck. Um, they make it to order

3674
04:10:43,940 --> 04:10:48,180
Which means that it takes a long time and it's coming from america

3675
04:10:48,180 --> 04:10:50,180
Hi

3676
04:10:50,500 --> 04:10:52,500
So I have to do that

3677
04:10:53,540 --> 04:10:55,540
It might be a while. I think so

3678
04:10:56,580 --> 04:10:58,020
I don't know

3679
04:10:58,020 --> 04:11:00,020
The tail might arrive faster

3680
04:11:01,940 --> 04:11:03,940
Uh

3681
04:11:06,820 --> 04:11:08,820
Hi strong

3682
04:11:08,980 --> 04:11:12,180
I don't know brine. Are you squinting imperial monarch?

3683
04:11:12,180 --> 04:11:18,100
Thank you for the three months extended membership. Happy three months. Also caller now. Fuck. Okay. Shit

3684
04:11:18,580 --> 04:11:20,100

3685
04:11:20,100 --> 04:11:22,100
Fuck me

3686
04:11:22,820 --> 04:11:24,820
We're not one chief

3687
04:11:25,380 --> 04:11:27,380
There you hear this

3688
04:11:27,860 --> 04:11:31,620
Fucking hell that's been taken off the start like the back of it

3689
04:11:32,420 --> 04:11:34,420
This is me putting it around my neck

3690
04:11:34,980 --> 04:11:36,020
Fuck no

3691
04:11:36,020 --> 04:11:39,060
So that fan arc was actually just straight up a previous reel

3692
04:11:39,620 --> 04:11:45,540
That artwork was insane that that uv like glow in the dark one. Oh my god. My hair's getting caught in it

3693
04:11:45,620 --> 04:11:48,900
Ow, I'm filling my hair. Wait, let me take my headset off

3694
04:11:50,980 --> 04:11:53,540
Caller I barely even know her

3695
04:11:54,340 --> 04:11:56,340
But it's

3696
04:11:57,060 --> 04:12:00,340
Well, I put it on there. Jeez. I'm not very smart

3697
04:12:01,700 --> 04:12:06,420
Wouldn't it be cuter if you call it you though? Imagine me looking up at you from the floor

3698
04:12:06,660 --> 04:12:10,260
I'm on my hands and looking up at you with a little pup like at the collar

3699
04:12:10,980 --> 04:12:12,980
Hmm

3700
04:12:14,500 --> 04:12:17,620
Okay, I got it on now you hear it. That's my nails against it

3701
04:12:20,580 --> 04:12:22,580
Now bark

3702
04:12:29,220 --> 04:12:32,340
You will all get into pet play and it'll be my fault

3703
04:12:33,300 --> 04:12:35,300
I don't know brian. Are you squinting me?

3704
04:12:35,620 --> 04:12:36,820
ABI

3705
04:12:36,820 --> 04:12:42,660

The fan service is insane. Look we cut to the chase over here

I don't talk to randoms because 90% of the time is awful. I'm happy to talk to you

3713
04:13:14,020 --> 04:13:17,460
I tried to talk in overwatch stream, but I didn't realize my mic was muted. Oh

3714
04:13:18,820 --> 04:13:24,260
If you play any games I'll have in the future. I'll bark as much as possible. Love you strudy. Love you too reflin

3715
04:13:25,060 --> 04:13:30,180
Well known amiss. Thank you for the extended membership good girl and I come here for scratches

3716
04:13:30,900 --> 04:13:32,900

3720
04:13:50,100 --> 04:13:54,500
I hope in a fun way. I hope I don't make you nervous. I promise you. I'm not a good gamer

3721
04:13:54,580 --> 04:13:58,740
So it's not like I'm gonna like judge your gamer skills or anything like that

3722
04:13:59,700 --> 04:14:06,580
I had the same problem in overwatch streams name. Are you getting nervous to play with me? Oh, no

3723
04:14:07,860 --> 04:14:11,300
How can I relieve that? I don't know how to relieve that

3724
04:14:13,060 --> 04:14:15,060
Oh

3725
04:14:15,300 --> 04:14:17,300
I'm so sorry

3726
04:14:17,620 --> 04:14:19,620
I don't want to make you scared of me

3727
04:14:20,740 --> 04:14:27,140
Hey, you're strong. Sorry. I didn't I didn't bark when I was in game. I got embarrassed. Oh, no

3728
04:14:27,220 --> 04:14:29,220
I'm scared. All of you's away

3729
04:14:31,060 --> 04:14:37,860
I'm making you so terrified of me. The pressure is real. You want to impress. I'm so sorry reflin

3730
04:14:38,260 --> 04:14:43,060
You can't disappoint me. You can't make me upset. I was so sorry. That was another

3731
04:14:45,220 --> 04:14:47,060
I like teasing you with a bark

3732
04:14:47,140 --> 04:14:52,020
I feel like if one person joins and talks and the others would talk more probably

3733
04:14:52,580 --> 04:14:57,700
I can't believe it. Um, oh, I have some people I was more scary or she be and you guys said she be so I was like

3734
04:14:58,260 --> 04:15:00,260
Obviously, you should just talk to me then

3735
04:15:00,980 --> 04:15:06,820
And then I can get you it's nerve-racking playing with your crush. Oh, that's so fucking cute

3736
04:15:08,660 --> 04:15:10,660
Yeah, I'm making nervous

3737
04:15:11,220 --> 04:15:16,420
Would be a shame if we had our first sleep over together, huh? And we played video game

3738
04:15:16,980 --> 04:15:26,420
And then I instantly sit on your lap without asking and then you wrap your arms around and we both have our controllers in front of us

3739
04:15:30,180 --> 04:15:32,180
I think that's how

3740
04:15:34,660 --> 04:15:40,500
Imagine getting a voice crack all seen something and oh, no, are you worried about your voice cracking?

3741
04:15:40,660 --> 04:15:43,140
Oh, my voice cracks on stream all the time though

3742
04:15:43,860 --> 04:15:45,860
Mmm

3743
04:15:46,180 --> 04:15:49,860
I couldn't bark because I was on the opposite team. Mmm, what you see

3744
04:15:51,540 --> 04:15:54,100
The idea of you hating us is more scary than dying

3745
04:15:54,980 --> 04:15:56,980
No

3746
04:15:57,060 --> 04:16:00,100
Mummy you're making me imagine stuff that only happened in my dreams

3747
04:16:01,300 --> 04:16:03,300
I mean I already have all your addresses

3748
04:16:06,420 --> 04:16:09,860
Oh, you thought you thought Marisy was the yandere. No, no, you see

3749
04:16:10,420 --> 04:16:17,060
Uh secretly I've been running left for dead through my own piehole servers. It's been logging your ip addresses

3750
04:16:17,220 --> 04:16:19,220
I now have all your addresses

3751
04:16:19,620 --> 04:16:24,420
Are you didn't are you didn't realize then you don't think it was funny my menu looks slightly different

3752
04:16:25,060 --> 04:16:30,900
You thought the ping was 300 because i'm in australia. Oh, no, no, no, no. I have gigabit internet

3753
04:16:31,140 --> 04:16:33,380
I assure you I I got the good stuff

3754
04:16:34,020 --> 04:16:36,020
I'll leave the door unlocked

3755
04:16:36,340 --> 04:16:38,340
Oh

3756
04:16:39,860 --> 04:16:41,860
But marriage it's over

3757
04:16:42,660 --> 04:16:46,340
Literally unlocking my doors now blackmail time

3758
04:16:47,860 --> 04:16:52,340
Forget netflix and chill when xbox and shove it into your smashbox

3759
04:16:53,060 --> 04:16:55,860
I've never heard that terminology before

3760
04:16:57,060 --> 04:16:59,060
Oh, wait, wait, wait, let me get on the game so you can get my

3761
04:16:59,860 --> 04:17:06,820
Pie holes for adblock and don't tell them that you can do a lot with a piehole though

3762
04:17:07,860 --> 04:17:09,860
You can do quite a lot with piehole

3763
04:17:10,500 --> 04:17:11,700
Hmm

3764
04:17:11,700 --> 04:17:16,100
Mummy can I have a hug and a kiss to have a headache? Oh, I'm sorry. I've been really loud

3765
04:17:17,460 --> 04:17:22,900
Well, I'll give you headpats with a microphone because this microphone can't cover like can't hear a hug it. It doesn't work

3766
04:17:23,780 --> 04:17:25,780
um

3767
04:17:26,740 --> 04:17:34,900
Please tell me you got these yesterday. Don't read it out loud. Monk away. I'm opening up your cat box link. What am I about to see?

3768
04:17:38,900 --> 04:17:42,820
That's that's manga wink wink

3769
04:17:46,820 --> 04:17:50,420
Uh as he pulled apart the cheeks of

3770
04:17:51,220 --> 04:17:57,860
Hmm, I'll replace the girl's name with my name as he pulled apart the cheeks of strony's huge butt with his fingers

3771
04:17:58,100 --> 04:18:05,860
He plunged his tentacles as far as it could go and strony could feel him pouring his genetic material

3772
04:18:05,940 --> 04:18:11,940
Into the deepest depths of her body. Oh, yes, pour your genetic material into me. We fling

3773
04:18:14,420 --> 04:18:16,420
There's a text post monka

3774
04:18:16,900 --> 04:18:18,900
Monka was the text post then

3775
04:18:20,980 --> 04:18:22,980
Hmm

3776
04:18:23,220 --> 04:18:27,380
Hi, mom. I love you. I love you too. I wanted to check on you after that ring for it stream

You said your muscles were sore and I'd like to help you out. You wrote me rp

3778
04:18:34,740 --> 04:18:35,780
I want

3779
04:18:35,780 --> 04:18:38,100
To strip you down and lay you on the massage table

3780
04:18:38,100 --> 04:18:44,020
I'd get some oil and start with my neck on your back then slowly work my way down your thighs legs and feet

3781
04:18:44,420 --> 04:18:49,940
You could tell me that I missed the spot and raise your butt slightly waggling it wagging it waggling

3782
04:18:50,900 --> 04:18:56,180
Oh, okay. I don't think pours genetic material was bigger. Honestly

3783
04:18:57,700 --> 04:19:02,420
Okay, I can't read the rest of that but I've got the link open so I can read it once the ad stream in

3784
04:19:03,460 --> 04:19:11,540
Um, mommy. I'm so happy. I got to bark for you, but I was petrified by anxiety anxiety. Oh my god. No, am I killing you guys?

3785
04:19:12,340 --> 04:19:14,340
Am I killing you refling?

3786
04:19:14,420 --> 04:19:19,540
Unironically am I killing you? I feel like I'm giving you like so much stress just trying to play with me

3787
04:19:19,940 --> 04:19:25,540
I think I'm doing more damage than good. Mommy. I'm so happy I got to bark

3788
04:19:25,540 --> 04:19:28,900
I was petrified by anxiety that I don't normally get otherwise I would have barked better

3789
04:19:29,140 --> 04:19:34,180
Either way, it was so much fun. Hopefully next time I'll bark better. Oh, I'm killing you

3790
04:19:35,220 --> 04:19:42,900
I'm actually killing you. Welcome to internet select. No, no, no. I'm mommy. You're refling the milk and then begins

3791
04:19:44,660 --> 04:19:49,860
You could say you're killing us softly. Oh, no, I hope I don't get deducted by yandere cuttlefish

3792
04:19:50,340 --> 04:19:52,340
We just want to make sure we put on a good show

3793
04:19:53,140 --> 04:19:58,580
My heart was beating a bit fast. Oh, not at all. We're learning to get out of our shells

3794
04:20:00,580 --> 04:20:02,580
I'm I'm

3795
04:20:02,740 --> 04:20:06,340
It's more I'm scared of a being every order. I will

3796
04:20:07,300 --> 04:20:11,940
One at a time mommy drained in all the refunds. I felt really nervous during the Elden Ring stream snipe

3797
04:20:12,500 --> 04:20:19,300
Especially when I was afk. Oh, no, I'm not. Don't be scared. You basically fulfill needs. We don't get anywhere

3798
04:20:19,940 --> 04:20:21,300
I mean

3799
04:20:21,300 --> 04:20:23,780
As long as you're happy and thriving. That's the main thing

3800
04:20:26,100 --> 04:20:33,300
We talk big talk be a text but our voices can be so shy. Stop. You're so unwordable

3801
04:20:34,660 --> 04:20:36,660
This is adorable

3802
04:20:37,780 --> 04:20:39,780
Hmm

3803
04:20:39,780 --> 04:20:43,540
This is adorable. I was nervous as well. So

04:20:47,860 --> 04:20:52,420
My little inklings you're so fucking cute. I want to

I want to fucking I want to like do those memes

3807
04:21:01,780 --> 04:21:06,420
Where it's like you're texting me like big game and all that and then I come over and you're so shy

3808
04:21:06,420 --> 04:21:10,020
You can hardly speak and I'm like, yeah, it's my time to talk

3809
04:21:12,980 --> 04:21:15,780
This is so fucking cute. I can't handle it

04:21:16,660 --> 04:21:22,900
Ah, stop being so cute. I'm smiling so hard right now. My cheeks are sore my face cheeks

3811
04:21:23,460 --> 04:21:25,460

3817
04:21:39,780 --> 04:21:43,940
So I'm just doing my regular birthday, but then my doughnathon is going to be on the saturday

04:21:44,500 --> 04:21:49,940
Um, I've still undecided. I'm going to decide next week what the deal is peo. Sorry if I sent this twice

3819
04:21:50,020 --> 04:21:53,620
I'm trying to figure out marshmallow. No, no, no, you're fine. Don't worry. Don't don't ever worry

3820
04:21:53,620 --> 04:21:57,940
If you've accidentally sent like a double marshmallow. It does not do anything. I promise I'm not like

3821
04:21:58,580 --> 04:22:01,460
This reefling is so inefficient. No, I am not like that

3822
04:22:01,940 --> 04:22:03,940
um

3823
04:22:04,180 --> 04:22:08,020
Just like naruto then. Oh, I've got the same birthday as naruto. Hold on

3825
04:22:23,700 --> 04:22:25,940

04:22:25,940 --> 04:22:29,060
Thank you for the stream mummy. I am more than welcome. Yeah, that's cool

3827
04:22:29,300 --> 04:22:31,940
The funny part is in real life is how it would actually go

3828
04:22:32,580 --> 04:22:37,140
Me just staring at you with my r word eyes on do you think I can get a toggle for that?

3829
04:22:38,980 --> 04:22:44,420
What would I what would our word eyes be? I don't know. I'm sure I could

3830
04:22:45,220 --> 04:22:47,220
Oh, no, are you?

3831
04:22:47,700 --> 04:22:49,700
For no particular reason

3832
04:22:50,660 --> 04:22:57,540
Uh, he's drawny. I kind of get nervous to talk as well, but I want to work on myself and get better. Yeah

3833
04:22:58,260 --> 04:23:02,820
Do reeflings move like cows when you milk them? No, you can run. You're like

3834
04:23:05,860 --> 04:23:07,860
Think like zombie noises but more human

3835
04:23:12,340 --> 04:23:17,540
I was hoping myself I'll practice in my bark so I could make you happy when I joined but then I frozen couldn't do it

3836
04:23:17,540 --> 04:23:19,540
When the moment came

3837
04:23:24,500 --> 04:23:26,740
Oh my god, wait, I never even asked that

3838
04:23:29,220 --> 04:23:33,300
Have any of you popped a tent will stream sniping be honest

3839
04:23:34,580 --> 04:23:40,420
Anonymous thank you for the tip wait you send send out marshmallow. You don't have to explode yourself in the stream

3840
04:23:41,300 --> 04:23:43,300
We howl

3841
04:23:43,460 --> 04:23:45,460
Oh

3842
04:23:45,780 --> 04:23:50,420
Maybe no way. Oh my god. Stop

3843
04:23:52,820 --> 04:23:54,660
Stop

3844
04:23:54,660 --> 04:23:59,540
You shouldn't reveal this information to me now. I'm to focus on trying to carry you to gas

3845
04:24:00,820 --> 04:24:02,820
Honestly though, I'm like really bad at this

3846
04:24:03,780 --> 04:24:08,580
Hi, mommy when you and she be went to up front to me earlier to ask me a bark

3847
04:24:08,580 --> 04:24:10,980
I tried my heart to see if my mic was picking up but nothing

3848
04:24:11,700 --> 04:24:18,500
Even though you tested it. Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't pick up my embarrass and wanes. I'm sorry. Don't call is that what?

3849
04:24:19,620 --> 04:24:21,620
No, yes. Oh my god

3850
04:24:22,820 --> 04:24:26,020
To focus so there's real gamers and there's real gunner

3851
04:24:28,180 --> 04:24:32,420
This year of the linux desktop is finally here

3852
04:24:33,620 --> 04:24:36,020
To update those every day, but not today again

3853
04:24:36,820 --> 04:24:43,780
I normally am not shy, so I barked really loudly, but I realized my mic was often pretty sure my

3854
04:24:44,820 --> 04:24:46,820
Me

3855
04:24:48,820 --> 04:24:50,820
No

3856
04:24:50,900 --> 04:24:52,100
I'm so sorry

3857
04:24:52,100 --> 04:24:57,700
That's hilarious to think that you're like your neighbors are like what the fuck is going on through that wall

3858
04:24:58,260 --> 04:25:00,260
And you're just like

3859
04:25:01,220 --> 04:25:03,220
Yeah

3860
04:25:03,620 --> 04:25:06,180
We're all good gamers here exactly

3861
04:25:07,940 --> 04:25:13,620
Gaming comes first. I can't believe I have some real gamers in here shocking the video these mics

3862
04:25:15,780 --> 04:25:20,820
Since all the models have their own mascots and members the velar has some sort of mascot member

3863
04:25:22,020 --> 04:25:24,020
No, there's no symbolism

3864
04:25:24,740 --> 04:25:27,140
For velar like in a mascot. Nah

3865
04:25:27,700 --> 04:25:28,900
Uh

3866
04:25:28,900 --> 04:25:31,860
I considered it, but because

3867
04:25:33,460 --> 04:25:35,140
the

3868
04:25:35,140 --> 04:25:39,540
The logo has a microphone in it. I was like, just call it that

3869
04:25:40,660 --> 04:25:43,380
Hi, scrawny. I want to absolutely ruin your back

3870
04:25:45,380 --> 04:25:47,780
Honestly, wait, there's another shit post

3871
04:25:48,500 --> 04:25:56,420
Sudo, I'm deleting gnu and linux 10% 99% complete error true open source software is impeccable

3872
04:25:58,420 --> 04:26:01,540
The velar mascot is unity refling exactly

3873
04:26:02,180 --> 04:26:07,140
My neighbors have an obnoxious dog that barks at everything. I'm sure I'll be fine with a loud bark about one

3874
04:26:09,060 --> 04:26:14,340
And now I need to train yous to pant and once you know how to pan and bark

3875
04:26:14,740 --> 04:26:17,540
I have you wrapped around my little finger

3876
04:26:19,220 --> 04:26:23,460
My plan is almost complete the sucky goes vacuum cleaner

3877
04:26:29,780 --> 04:26:34,340
Let's go inking. Oh dang it. Oh dang it. That was my longest yet

3878
04:26:34,340 --> 04:26:38,420
But did you know the let's go gambling guy has an odd dang it merch?

3879
04:26:38,820 --> 04:26:42,580
How could we buy you one you want to buy me a hat? Why?

3880
04:26:43,700 --> 04:26:45,700
That seems so random in particular

3881
04:26:46,580 --> 04:26:48,580
Oh

3882
04:26:48,580 --> 04:26:52,420
Hi, scrawny. I think I'll buy a mic so I can say hi when I play games. I love you. I love you, too

3883
04:26:52,420 --> 04:26:54,420
You don't have to buy a microphone

3884
04:26:55,220 --> 04:26:57,220
I promise you don't have to buy a microphone

3885
04:26:57,940 --> 04:27:01,380
I'd rather you keep your money and spend on yourself something nice

3886
04:27:02,420 --> 04:27:06,980
All right, linux shit poster wrap it up wrap it up third time's your charm

3887
04:27:07,540 --> 04:27:10,020
I can pant for you anytime damn straight

3888
04:27:12,500 --> 04:27:15,060
Yeah, but the most important thing is

3889
04:27:27,220 --> 04:27:32,340
I leave you stream on audio playing over my speakers and have a nap it makes you enter my dream and I wake up

3890
04:27:32,660 --> 04:27:37,460
With a big tentacle and thinking my name is refling

3891
04:27:38,180 --> 04:27:43,780
I think since you always scream refling on stream, I get scolded a lot with the tunes like that or six

3892
04:27:43,780 --> 04:27:45,780
He is kind of scolding

3893
04:27:47,140 --> 04:27:52,180
You're the reflin that wants me to do an angry audio in my accent isn't that?

3894
04:27:53,540 --> 04:27:56,900
I said reflin. Yeah, I'm done. I'm gonna finish with you yet

3895
04:27:58,740 --> 04:28:00,740
Now refling what you mean

3896
04:28:03,060 --> 04:28:07,940
I hope my bark was sufficient for you. You joked about us being pre-trained, but that includes you too, doesn't it?

3897
04:28:09,460 --> 04:28:11,460
I had tears you

3898
04:28:11,460 --> 04:28:13,460
You want to train me more?

3899
04:28:14,420 --> 04:28:16,420
The hypno stream worked we're winning

3900
04:28:17,060 --> 04:28:21,940
Strani, I just had to my landlord visit me and raise my rent because he heard barking coming from my place instead

3901
04:28:21,940 --> 04:28:23,940
I had a pet

3902
04:28:24,100 --> 04:28:29,540
Next time I don't think how bark is loud. Okay, you win. Hold on. Hold on. You win

3903
04:28:29,700 --> 04:28:33,860
Let me open up my stream deck. You fucking win. That was good

3904
04:28:35,540 --> 04:28:39,700
That was good. I'll give you that one. You're getting a round of applause for that one

3905
04:28:41,860 --> 04:28:43,620
Hmm

3906
04:28:43,620 --> 04:28:45,620
Mom, I haven't popped the tent while playing with you yet

3907
04:28:45,620 --> 04:28:47,700
But I think it's more of a matter of being focused on the game

3908
04:28:47,780 --> 04:28:52,980
And if you really dedicate a moment to teasing it would definitely happen though. You give me a heart bone

3909
04:28:53,300 --> 04:28:55,300
Oh, that was so awesome

3910
04:28:56,260 --> 04:29:02,020
Sorry, I can't join until the end of my read-a-moment. Thank you for stream sniping. Have a good night rest well sleepyhead

3928
04:31:03,380 --> 04:31:08,420
I've never watched a vtuber let alone a streamer that was so vocal about wanting to bang their own fans

3929
04:31:09,060 --> 04:31:14,820
Wait, is that okay watching you has legit changed my brain and now I can't stop thinking about you are wording me

Yeah, are you getting it now? Are you getting the best part?

3932

Are you are you understanding? I want your ink is this isn't going in

3933
04:31:32,820 --> 04:31:34,820

3934

Oh, what's that you're used to fucking you're used to vtubers like

3935
04:31:40,980 --> 04:31:46,260
Fucking putting on an act and being like I hate my job. I hate doing anything remotely

3936
04:31:46,980 --> 04:31:48,500
Uh

3937
04:31:48,500 --> 04:31:50,660
Alternative and they hate it and did is there?

3939
04:31:59,460 --> 04:32:02,180
It's not even a fucking job. We are we inking?

3940
04:32:04,020 --> 04:32:06,020
Are we inking them in these trees?

3941
04:32:06,820 --> 04:32:13,940
Well, your birthday lines up with national walk to the park day. Maybe it was fate you become a puppy puppy vtuber arc when

3942
04:32:13,940 --> 04:32:15,940
I

3943
04:32:29,300 --> 04:32:34,500
One nice thing about power social relationships is that you can experience feelings that help for later

3944
04:32:34,580 --> 04:32:38,900
You ask them you ask them to bark and they give a half hearted and quite

3945
04:32:39,380 --> 04:32:43,460
Quiet extra bark. They are a bit shy and tentative

3946
04:32:43,460 --> 04:32:48,500
But do it anyway later these reeflings will find future lady reeflings and they ask them to bark

3947
04:32:48,740 --> 04:32:53,380
They'll be ready to do it and be able to flirt back and they'll be quite happy and proud you gave them the push

3948
04:32:53,700 --> 04:32:56,100
So keep asking the reeflings to bark

3949
04:32:58,580 --> 04:33:02,820
That's so cute. It's good for them. Oh, you're so fucking cute

3950
04:33:02,980 --> 04:33:07,940
Yeah, even if your bark is really tiny and cute and adorable. Don't worry. I can keep training

3951
04:33:08,900 --> 04:33:10,900
I

3952
04:33:11,380 --> 04:33:14,900
Train you harder. You're my responsibility for now. Okay

3953
04:33:16,580 --> 04:33:20,660
And then if you ever want to go don't worry, mommy understand

3954
04:33:22,260 --> 04:33:24,260
But for now you're under my leash

3955
04:33:26,260 --> 04:33:28,260
You're colored and leashed

3956
04:33:28,500 --> 04:33:32,500
The question was raised earlier about what flavors are here. Everyone says what I mean

3957
04:33:33,460 --> 04:33:35,460
So I think it's what I mean

3958
04:33:36,020 --> 04:33:38,020
Mmm

3959
04:33:38,340 --> 04:33:41,860
Mommy how much overtime should as reeflings there for the don't nothing

3960
04:33:42,340 --> 04:33:48,260
Literally no overtime. Please don't test maro because I don't think they're getting through also. Love you. Momelov

3961
04:33:48,980 --> 04:33:50,980
Well, I find that one

3962
04:33:53,300 --> 04:33:55,300
Can't read that one

3963
04:33:57,700 --> 04:34:03,220
I'll read the set. Hi strong. I sometimes wonder if you want to that's it not reading the rest

3968
04:34:31,220 --> 04:34:33,220

3969
04:34:34,980 --> 04:34:38,020
Wait, are you the watermelon? Are you the person that started all?

3970
04:34:40,580 --> 04:34:44,660
Are you the person like you're the first person to say that my hair is watermelon flavorant?

3974
04:35:06,420 --> 04:35:08,740
It's not gonna make a noise. I can only tap it

3975
04:35:09,460 --> 04:35:11,460
Like that's the only way I can do it

3976
04:35:12,260 --> 04:35:15,460

3979
04:35:25,220 --> 04:35:27,220
Then

3980
04:35:28,740 --> 04:35:31,620
Well mate, I'm not too familiar with Vtuber culture. Don't worry

3981
04:35:31,780 --> 04:35:37,460
Do people usually put their user names in marshmallows? No, they do not. So marshmallow is supposed to be anonymous

3982
04:35:38,020 --> 04:35:40,740
Um, and it's uncommon to

3983
04:35:41,620 --> 04:35:44,820
I wouldn't they definitely hardly ever get it

3984
04:35:45,780 --> 04:35:49,380
I don't know if it's frowned upon. Am I supposed to spank people if they do that?

3985
04:35:50,580 --> 04:35:52,580
I don't know

3986
04:35:55,620 --> 04:36:01,220
My heart flutters when I play with you. Um, and you compliment me. I can't get a tank because it's a depression med

3987
04:36:02,020 --> 04:36:07,060
Oh, I remember seeing a don't give up on those meds. By the way, um

3988
04:36:08,180 --> 04:36:12,260
They take a long time to take effect and they help. Um, I know it takes away your bone bone

3989
04:36:12,340 --> 04:36:17,540
Which is really a really bizarre thing to take away. But um, I wait. No, I already said that

3990
04:36:18,420 --> 04:36:24,900
Yeah, I already said that someone was like, oh, why is there not fast acting anti-depressants motherfucker?

3991
04:36:24,900 --> 04:36:27,940
That's called hardcore drugs. They're classified. Um, don't

3992
04:36:28,660 --> 04:36:35,540
Don't don't don't forget to take them because it takes a very long time for them to get into your system. Um

3993
04:36:36,420 --> 04:36:40,420
And if you stop or have to change doses, it becomes a fucking nightmare. Um

3994
04:36:41,140 --> 04:36:50,260
Cause I used to do research on depression medication and that shit's fucking hard. Uh, if you didn't know, depression and a

3995
04:36:51,220 --> 04:36:53,060
Narcotic

3996
04:36:53,060 --> 04:37:00,020
Uh drugs or they're currently trialling lsd for long-term depression right now. Uh, and it's having some interesting results

3997
04:37:00,020 --> 04:37:02,020
I am watching it. Um

3998
04:37:04,100 --> 04:37:07,460
For fuck's sake, how is this a linux shit poster?

3999
04:37:07,700 --> 04:37:15,300
How is this a linux shit poster? I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to is linux is in fact gnu linux or

4000
04:37:16,260 --> 04:37:21,380
As I've recently taken to call it gnu plus linux linux. It's not an operating system in itself

4001
04:37:21,780 --> 04:37:24,740
Right, wrap it up linux boy. Wrap it up

4002
04:37:26,260 --> 04:37:28,260
Wrap it up. Hmm

4003
04:37:29,220 --> 04:37:31,220

4005
04:37:43,540 --> 04:37:45,540

Like thinking about a five three fifty kilogram mummy trying to pin me down

4080
04:43:42,500 --> 04:43:49,060
Fuck you. My legs are stronger than my upper body. I can pin you down. I can leg lock you

4081
04:43:49,620 --> 04:43:52,500
I can do a lot with my thighs and my legs. Okay

04:43:53,460 --> 04:43:55,460
I can make it happen

4083
04:43:56,820 --> 04:44:02,820
I assure you I have enough strength in my legs to make up for whatever the rest of my body that can't make up, okay

4084
04:44:04,420 --> 04:44:07,780
Thunder says literally we're gonna do a fruit crush and stream

Prove it. Oh, no, we're gonna do a fruit crush and stream

4087
04:44:18,180 --> 04:44:22,500
I'm gonna do a stream where I crush fruit in between my thighs. It's gonna be a milestone though

4088
04:44:22,580 --> 04:44:24,580
So it's not anytime soon. But yeah

4089
04:44:25,860 --> 04:44:29,700
All of the masses and her legs and her butt. I think it's because I ride a bike

4090
04:44:31,220 --> 04:44:33,220
I don't know how to drive

4091
04:44:34,020 --> 04:44:38,420
So I ride a bike and I think that's why I've been very blessed

Actually, yeah, would I even have to like lock you?

4095
04:44:55,220 --> 04:44:59,380
If you'd be so scared to do anything with me really

4096
04:44:59,380 --> 04:45:01,380
Hmm

4097
04:45:02,900 --> 04:45:10,820

04:45:23,140 --> 04:45:26,340
The most powerful lip looks are the ones in the mind

4103
04:45:27,140 --> 04:45:32,260
Average reflund would just pass it barking while inking and panting after inking

4104
04:45:34,900 --> 04:45:38,740
I would be paralyzed by the forwardness. So no, you you wouldn't even have to try

4105
04:45:42,180 --> 04:45:47,140
Strongly must be the type of girl who likes guys that can't look women in the eye. Yeah

4106
04:45:47,620 --> 04:45:50,980
Stereotypical nerdy guy gets bullied by the popular girl

4107
04:45:51,540 --> 04:45:54,500
I'm not a fucking popular girl. Don't put me in that ranking

04:46:44,900 --> 04:46:50,500
Uh by my established friend group and then I left and then I don't have a high school education

4121
04:46:50,660 --> 04:46:52,660
I never finished high school

4122
04:46:53,220 --> 04:46:55,220
Because I had no friends

4123
04:46:56,980 --> 04:46:58,980
Um

4124
04:46:59,060 --> 04:47:02,820
You what? Yeah, I'm not high school educated. I dropped out

4125
04:47:03,540 --> 04:47:07,940
I had no friends and I was um, I developed like social anxiety and all that

4126
04:47:08,260 --> 04:47:13,380
I don't have social anxiety anymore. Hey, I just have general the one that sticks about me unfortunately, but

4127
04:47:13,940 --> 04:47:15,620
um

4128
04:47:15,620 --> 04:47:20,260
Yeah, like have I not told this it's a bit depressing. This is probably why I've not said it

4129
04:47:20,900 --> 04:47:22,420
I had a really

4130
04:47:22,420 --> 04:47:29,940
Really bad time at high school, which led me to be in housebound for two years and I developed very extreme a bomb

4131
04:47:30,660 --> 04:47:38,180
Um, but thankfully I don't have like social a bomb at all. Like I'm very confident. I love I love socializing

4132
04:47:38,500 --> 04:47:41,540
I think like to make up for like the time I couldn't basically

4133
04:47:42,100 --> 04:47:43,060
um

4134
04:47:43,060 --> 04:47:47,940
That's why like I'm good at well good quotation marks. That's why I'm into video games because you know

4135
04:47:48,660 --> 04:47:52,500
Video game interactions a lot different than like real life type stuff. Um

4136
04:47:53,780 --> 04:47:58,500
But yeah, that's why I'm not high school educated and I've never finished high school. I left

4137
04:47:59,220 --> 04:48:00,500
um

4138
04:48:00,500 --> 04:48:02,500
Johnny's got no gcs. He's

4139
04:48:03,460 --> 04:48:05,460
Hey

4140
04:48:07,060 --> 04:48:08,420
Um

4141
04:48:08,420 --> 04:48:14,100
I'm so really to hear things got better. Oh, yeah, things got better. Like I just have the regular born anxiety, you know

4142
04:48:15,460 --> 04:48:17,860
I have the one that's like don't leave the house

4143
04:48:18,500 --> 04:48:21,300
And the world is scary and I'm like, okay

4144
04:48:22,260 --> 04:48:27,940
That's really fucking boring to deal with. I hate it's the boring one. It's the resident sleeper one

4145
04:48:29,300 --> 04:48:31,300
Hmm

4146
04:48:31,300 --> 04:48:34,500
Sorry to hear that. I didn't hear that. I didn't want to bring it. No, no, I don't mean talking about it

4147
04:48:34,580 --> 04:48:38,340
I don't I don't like talking about sad subjects in general. Um

4148
04:48:39,780 --> 04:48:43,540
But yeah, I uh, yeah, that's the lord like I don't know

4149
04:48:43,620 --> 04:48:48,900
Maybe you're like, oh shoneys too much into internet culture something's going on and it was like I never went

4150
04:48:48,900 --> 04:48:53,620
I was saying, you know party drink all that kind of thing never had none of that

4151
04:48:54,660 --> 04:48:57,460
None of it all just video games video games. Um

4152
04:48:58,180 --> 04:49:02,100
Like when I say that my parents are really understanding about me playing video games

4153
04:49:02,500 --> 04:49:07,140
Um, obviously that extended into time where I should have been in education

4154
04:49:07,700 --> 04:49:11,540
But they knew that I was fucked up from it and they didn't know what to do with me

4155
04:49:11,620 --> 04:49:17,540
So they just let me play video games. Um, and it worked out in the end. I mean, holy shit mom and dad

4156
04:49:17,620 --> 04:49:24,180
I'm so playing video games. Um, so yeah, that's why I always say like mom and dad are the best and all of that

4157
04:49:25,140 --> 04:49:27,140
Nothing you need that education anyway

4158
04:49:27,700 --> 04:49:32,740
Literally like I don't know how it worked out because everything should have gone wrong

4159
04:49:32,980 --> 04:49:35,380
but it worked out in the end and um

4160
04:49:36,020 --> 04:49:39,700
the way I got over my um

4161
04:49:41,220 --> 04:49:47,140
The major like social anxiety was um, um, my job as a waitress

4162
04:49:47,860 --> 04:49:53,940
My job's really really helped me all the jobs that I've had in the past like really really helped me be myself and

4163
04:49:54,340 --> 04:49:56,340
realize that like

4164
04:49:57,140 --> 04:50:03,700
Ken what the world is scary, but I can't live my life in between four walls type thing

4165
04:50:05,140 --> 04:50:06,820
um

4166
04:50:06,820 --> 04:50:08,820
Yeah

4167
04:50:08,980 --> 04:50:12,660
You put in the work even you see us work. I've never seen the appeal of going to parties

4168
04:50:13,380 --> 04:50:17,940
I don't and I'm I don't if you get has anyone been to a party

4169
04:50:18,660 --> 04:50:22,660
I think it's for socializing and just telling funny stories and that right

4170
04:50:24,260 --> 04:50:27,460
And but people get a bit drunk and then sometimes they make out

4171
04:50:28,020 --> 04:50:31,540
And then sometimes they find a pair of her at the party that's in the cent play

4172
04:50:32,580 --> 04:50:34,580
get her

4173
04:50:38,420 --> 04:50:43,140
And I avoided the some parties. Have you been to

4174
04:50:44,500 --> 04:50:46,500
Becks parties

4175
04:50:47,540 --> 04:50:49,140
They make it

4176
04:50:49,140 --> 04:50:51,940
Parties are the worst. Yeah, it's just to meet new people

4177
04:50:52,500 --> 04:50:54,500
Damn

4178
04:50:55,060 --> 04:50:57,060
All of you girls have crazy lore

4179
04:50:59,140 --> 04:51:01,140
Minds the loner I could have been a

4180
04:51:02,340 --> 04:51:06,820
I can't say that uh, especially not with what's happened really recently. Um

4181
04:51:08,260 --> 04:51:10,260
Yeah, my lore is the loner

4182
04:51:10,260 --> 04:51:16,820
Basically, I don't know what everyone else is. I don't know what the girls have said their lore is but my my lore is the loner

4183
04:51:17,780 --> 04:51:24,660
That's why you haven't kept to ink for a voice to ink for the personality to ink for veiny hands to ink

4184
04:51:24,740 --> 04:51:28,340
Oh, you like my veiny hands really say a voice to ink for oh, yeah

4185
04:51:28,820 --> 04:51:32,660

4186
04:51:33,460 --> 04:51:35,460
Thank you

4187
04:51:35,540 --> 04:51:37,540
for the tip

4188
04:51:38,500 --> 04:51:42,260
I've been at parties. There's just some friends my first job I had

4189
04:51:43,140 --> 04:51:47,220
It was cursed as it helped me a lot in some ways to get better

4190
04:51:48,980 --> 04:51:50,660
Place on

4191
04:51:50,660 --> 04:51:51,860
very

4192
04:51:51,860 --> 04:51:53,860
Sorry, that's a lot of words

4193
04:51:54,740 --> 04:51:59,620
Too bad. I'm trying my best to read them. I guess I have been a part lately. It was like all after I graduated though

4194
04:52:00,900 --> 04:52:02,900
I've been a one you've been a beg

4195
04:52:03,780 --> 04:52:05,780
party

4196
04:52:06,580 --> 04:52:11,460
Now hold on a minute. Pull up the receipt. Pull up the notes. What happened?

4197
04:52:13,220 --> 04:52:20,020
What happens? It's not as crazy as you think and also it's way quieter than most parties. What happens?

4198
04:52:22,580 --> 04:52:27,380
I hurt myself seven years ago when I was new to construction back pain reflex last week

4199
04:52:27,460 --> 04:52:31,540
We were more busy than usual. So lots of heavy lifting that caused it

4200
04:52:32,020 --> 04:52:36,020
Also, since I graduated I've also become more socially anxious

4201
04:52:36,740 --> 04:52:41,700
Oh, I thought it would get better because like if you're in the workplace and that I found it easier to actually

4202
04:52:41,940 --> 04:52:45,300
I fucking hated the high school environment. I absolutely hated it

4203
04:52:45,380 --> 04:52:49,220
And then once I realized the world isn't like high school, then it got better

4204
04:52:50,100 --> 04:52:54,180
Lonely glizzy. Thank you for the tip. I hope your back is better. Holy fuck, please

4205
04:52:56,180 --> 04:53:00,980
You're not lifting with your back, right? You're lifting with your knees

4206
04:53:02,340 --> 04:53:04,340
Yeah

4207
04:53:04,500 --> 04:53:08,420
Right, I'm pretty sure it's your knees. You're the last 12

4208
04:53:11,460 --> 04:53:15,220
Stronger you're the sexy woman I've ever known everything about you makes me want to ink. Oh, yeah

4209
04:53:16,820 --> 04:53:22,900
Imagine uh, so I'm writing a meta audio. You approach the loner girl. Let's go

4210
04:53:23,780 --> 04:53:26,740
And it turns out she's a freak and she reads shoulder

4211
04:53:27,460 --> 04:53:29,460
Sorry, that was a bit terrible

4212
04:53:29,700 --> 04:53:31,700
Ah

4213
04:53:32,020 --> 04:53:40,980

4214
04:53:43,140 --> 04:53:48,580
I'm gonna redirect into a zero who is coming up. I'm coming up

4215
04:53:49,700 --> 04:53:51,700
To let the world know

4216
04:53:53,220 --> 04:53:55,220
What is this rude them?

4217
04:53:56,180 --> 04:53:58,340
Shazer is done for the week. Wait, what?

4218
04:54:00,260 --> 04:54:02,260
Her streams aren't up

4219
04:54:05,060 --> 04:54:08,660
I'll guess the streams are not uh, okay, I guess we'll redirect into

4220
04:54:09,780 --> 04:54:10,980
See

4221
04:54:10,980 --> 04:54:18,100
We've got to let the world know that she's playing wild arms alter codef party retro gaming on the ps

4222
04:54:18,660 --> 04:54:20,660
Um, that is today, right?

4223
04:54:22,260 --> 04:54:24,260
It's not today. Oh

4224
04:54:26,180 --> 04:54:28,180
All right, man

4225

04:54:38,180 --> 04:54:40,180
Right, we'll redirect into serenity

4227
04:54:41,220 --> 04:54:47,540
Yeah, I could beat my record to ink and that you can get empty from inking it hurts, but well worth it

4228
04:54:47,540 --> 04:54:49,540
Oh

How many thank you anonama for the tip

4230
04:55:03,460 --> 04:55:06,420
Honestly, I'm glad to see him people that suffered in school are v-troopers

4231
04:55:07,220 --> 04:55:13,220
I honestly think people can tell when a v-trooper isn't one of us in terms of like

4232
04:55:14,180 --> 04:55:19,700
If I ever saw a girl like you in high school, you would have fit right in with me and my circle of friends

4233
04:55:20,420 --> 04:55:26,820
I'll be the nerdy boy to your edgy got girl gamer. Yeah. Oh my god. Yeah

4234
04:55:27,940 --> 04:55:30,900
Because I was so dark and mysterious, but really I was just

4235
04:55:31,380 --> 04:55:34,100
I hated my life. I hated it

4236
04:55:35,060 --> 04:55:37,060
I hate

04:56:17,540 --> 04:56:20,900

4246
04:56:22,340 --> 04:56:24,340
BTDs

4247
04:56:24,340 --> 04:56:26,340

child labor

4259
04:57:09,860 --> 04:57:12,260
If I knew you in house, so you'd be nervous to talk to you

4260
04:57:15,460 --> 04:57:17,940
I was the girl that used to get asked out

4261
04:57:20,420 --> 04:57:27,700
And uh, actually happened in primary school where they ask you out as a joke like no one. No, I don't want to actually

4262
04:57:28,660 --> 04:57:30,660
Go stronti
