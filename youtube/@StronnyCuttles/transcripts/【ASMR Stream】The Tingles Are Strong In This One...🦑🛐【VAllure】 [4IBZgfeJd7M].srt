1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
O-re-blank

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
O-re-blank

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Is it time to feel sleepy?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Like how are you playing?

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Are you sleepy, baby?

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You're so cute when you're so sleepy

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and you got your little morning voice on

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
but it's time to go back to sleep

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Thank you Dominic for becoming a mempa

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Good morning little reflin, but you must be so tired

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You should go back to sleep

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, you should go back to sleep

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Cos you're my tired baby

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What do you mean you've never seen my bedroom since debut?

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're such a sleepyhead, of course you've seen my bedrooms and staples.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You want me to tuck you in, in my little clam?

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
My little clam bed, behind me.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's going to be not in my clam.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Do you like the way the water wiggles in my bedroom?

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Do you find it tantalizing?

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
My little reflex.

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Look, I have a little 3D on my desk and I have one in front of me too.

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Do I need to turn up to make sense of the video?

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Or have I been a good streamer?

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah, do you like my decorational wall?

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I really have two things I can click.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay, you're on my table.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm applying your Risky.

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Refling.

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Why is it when I go on YouTube,

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:54,000
my most recent short of me clapping with no hands, is my most popular content?

33
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What did you do?

34
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What did you do?

35
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Hey girls, it's my most popular content.

36
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I think I even outpaced the video.

37
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, I'm not apologizing.

38
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Thank you to the doubter who made that clip possible.

39
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Arissa is my editor and she's hilarious.

40
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We haven't really spoken to each other at all

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and I just sent her an audio of me clapping and she said,

42
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
yeah, I'll make it a short.

43
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm like, yeah, Arissa is a homie for sure.

44
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Oh, you look so sleepy.

45
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You look so sleepy like this, I just want to eat you up all for myself.

46
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And you get all cute and whiny when you're tired as well.

47
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Little boy.

48
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Is it hard to fight the temptation to fall asleep again?

49
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Especially when I rub on your ears.

50
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I made a little cup of tea.

51
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Go by hands all over your ears.

52
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And it's going ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

53
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Wow.

54
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Thank you, Dr. Milmi Naman.

55
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Wanna swim more, please?

56
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
For becoming a member.

57
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We have been strong and there's a brief stream after this one I need to be a week for.

58
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Do you know what we're writing about in that naughty stream?

59
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We're writing about making honey tea.

60
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And by making honey tea, I mean honey and tea.

61
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So you guys get to tell me what you want me to say.

62
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So I think I'll be very interested in how am I feeling?

63
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Ah, my sleepy baby.

64
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The reason why I'm role-playing that you're a sleepy baby so successfully

65
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
is because I woke up seven minutes before stream.

66
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But my little wreathling.

67
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I did get some sleep, darling.

68
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I got lots of progress behind the scenes done.

69
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If I'm not mistaken.

70
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If, hold on, I need to check if it's even up.

71
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I got lots of background work done.

72
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And I want the video to stop, yeah?

73
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Okay, well that didn't work.

74
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I think tomorrow?

75
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I don't know.

76
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
There's going to be a seven man collab.

77
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That comes out soon.

78
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I edited a seven man collab.

79
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I have secured a fourth highlight slash clipper.

80
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,000
There should be a new short out on AC and Azura.

81
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
There should be a highlight video out on Marisy.

82
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Thanks to a shadowed or, I think there's a highlight clip of AC.

83
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Thanks to shadowed or everyone's now at 5K.

84
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Ah, my babies, they're growing up so fast.

85
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I can't handle it.

86
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I will post the celebration 5K artworks

87
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and I need to find it.

88
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I've lost it.

89
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I commissioned it quite a while ago.

90
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The Marisy highlight video was good.

91
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Did you like it?

92
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Where she was anky.

93
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But Jess, I am very thankful you guys let me get some rest.

94
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I fell back asleep for five hours

95
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and then I woke up and then I worked all the way through until three hours ago

96
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and then I lied down for a nap and my alarm got me up.

97
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And I was basically a zombie making myself a cup of tea.

98
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But it's okay.

99
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
There's a Yumi Plus collab today.

100
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So I get to be the grumpy angry Scots in the collab.

101
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And I'm so annoyed.

102
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
One of the girls is from Australia

103
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and I joked that I was gonna go to her house

104
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and she was like, oh no, you can actually come to my house.

105
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And of course we don't live in the same zoo.

106
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I hate it.

107
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I could have had my first offline collab.

108
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Like my first feature for offline collab.

109
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Don't get me wrong, I'm bossy enough to show up at someone's door.

110
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm looking funny.

111
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Madden Vastroni, will the girls pre-recorded SFW ASMR on Tron like yours?

112
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And will we see any collab on there as well from any other VA's?

113
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I will hold on anonymous.

114
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let me reread that.

115
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You crazy madman.

116
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Why did you spell it?

117
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Why did you spell it like that?

118
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Will we see pre-recorded like me?

119
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And will we see any collabs?

120
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes, Shabby has a collab with a girl coming up.

121
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That's not in VA lore.

122
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
AC and Emmy have their own collab that's going on YouTube on Emmy's channel.

123
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Um, Azura might be doing a collab with someone.

124
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I need to set it up.

125
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Basically, if it's an ASMR collab, I have to go set it up.

126
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The Shabby collab I didn't have to set up.

127
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But I'm very thankful for the situation that unfolded.

128
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Because it means Shabby gets some time to shine.

129
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Your first girl night ruined by Australia, honestly.

130
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Aren't Dono's supposed to be off?

131
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I've put them super quiet.

132
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Are they supposed to be off?

133
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I think if I was like, dry-eyed and

134
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
dreams of Strony kicking down the Rieveland store

135
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
for an impromptu and concession,

136
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I think they're asking me, are we on Patreon?

137
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What's Madienne, Mahath?

138
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Is it a green?

139
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Hi, Strony.

140
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Well, the girls is...

141
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
On Tron.

142
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Not the movie.

143
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
See, there's this movie franchise called Tron.

144
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And it's like about a bike that's blue.

145
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm fucking delirious.

146
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'll wake up shortly, hold on.

147
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'll go drink my tea.

148
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I can start uploading all the audios on their Patreon as well.

149
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That will be a me job because I'm not making them to...

150
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Well, they don't even have access to their Patreon, so...

151
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That part's impossible anyway.

152
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Thank you for your tip, and please give me some time to do that.

153
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But yes, it will all be archived on the year.

154
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Appropriate Patreon, so...

155
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm just trying to think of what work I have to do,

156
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and I bet it's just their meme audios at the minute.

157
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Right?

158
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Right?

159
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Don't push too hard.

160
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Tell me about it.

161
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I finally got like...

162
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm so angry, but not in a bad way.

163
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But I'm just angry because...

164
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I did a shorter stream,

165
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and I got so much work done behind the scenes,

166
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and I hate it.

167
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I want to stream all the time.

168
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And because I know July is coming up,

169
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
and my dad's coming over,

170
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm still so tired, I'm exhausted.

171
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I had bloodshot eyes yesterday,

172
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
or, yeah, yesterday, which kind of freaked me out a bit.

173
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But because July's coming,

174
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and then I truly am going to do like two or four of our streamers max,

175
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm like, I want to make up for it now

176
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
with all the content to offer.

177
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Because I don't even know...

178
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I don't...

179
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
If my dad is asleep,

180
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't think I can even do ASMR because he snores.

181
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But he like, he like,

182
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
snores, like shakes the house, snore.

183
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Speaking of Patreon, your last audio was good.

184
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Did you like it?

185
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Did you like my armpit?

186
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Could you do a stream when you chat and work on stuff in the background?

187
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You'll never guess what we're doing in two hours.

188
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
We're writing a script that's actually work.

189
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And if you guys like it,

190
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
then we can do more.

191
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Okay, I finished my cup of tea before it gets too cold.

192
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm gonna put you down right here,

193
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and see what I'm gonna bubble you.

194
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm gonna bubble you.

195
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I was Mercy's latest audio written by you.

196
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Sadly, yes.

197
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The girls' first two months of content is by me.

198
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And also, please understand,

199
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I didn't actually know or have the girls,

200
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
when I wrote them, I just had their characters.

201
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So please don't be like,

202
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
oh, this doesn't fit.

203
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Please be so realistic.

204
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This is a, it's very big.

205
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's not something that can be done overnight.

206
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Are you like, gulping ASMR?

207
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Wow.

208
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
She said, wait, what was Mercy's recent?

209
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I can't remember.

210
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You don't like Mercy's?

211
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Why, was there a problem with Mercy's?

212
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Shoulda picked Mercy.

213
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
All the audios I've written have been already.

214
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Feels good, man.

215
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I was really nervous about writing for Emi.

216
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I was like, am I going too far here?

217
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And I was like, now fuck it, we're already going far enough.

218
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
We created it, so we can just keep going.

219
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Wow.

220
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What's her name?

221
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Mercy?

222
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Put it in there.

223
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Girlfriend gets crazier in ovulation.

224
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah, yeah, I definitely wrote that one, right?

225
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You're trying to embarrass me with the scripts, aren't you?

226
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Your girlfriend has been waiting so long for you to finally come home and pound her.

227
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Whenever she ovulates, she just can't get enough of your tentacles.

228
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah, that's me that wrote that one, right?

229
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yes, that's very me that wrote that one.

230
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The girls have done great for the start of their contents.

231
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And please understand for a lot of girls,

232
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
this is actually the first time they've ever wrote anything of this ed roll.

233
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
They have recorded anything of this nature, okay?

234
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So please don't be overly critical.

235
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Don't be that one person that's like, what the heck?

236
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Your very first audio doesn't sound like someone who has produced audios for 20 years.

237
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Outrage it.

238
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Now shut the fuck up.

239
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Shut up.

240
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You literally get four audios for five dollars.

241
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Fucking name one other VA that does that.

242
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
On top of that, they're streaming for free.

243
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
On top of that, they're putting content around Twitter for free.

244
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Like, sorry, I'm arguing with spirits again, but...

245
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Wait, unfortunately, yes, I did write that.

246
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The next month's stuff I wrote and then it starts to swap.

247
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
We did have two temporary batches made not by me.

248
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't know how it's gonna go for the girls.

249
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I specifically...

250
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Sorry, this is just me going on behind the scenes round.

251
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I specifically commissioned a format.

252
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And I asked them to mimic the format because I said,

253
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
not only is this format the best, I will show you the format in the next stream, in the member stream.

254
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I specifically said, do the format like this.

255
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The girls can record it super easily and they won't lose their place

256
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
and the editors know what to do when they get to certain sections, okay?

257
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And they didn't do it.

258
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And now I have, I think, eight scripts that are not in the correct format

259
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and the poor girl has to figure out what to do.

260
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Because there's no format at them correctly.

261
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And I'm like, I gave them the example, I explained the importance of the format, so, yeah.

262
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yeah.

263
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm fighting the ghosts again, I honestly, um...

264
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You're doing really well getting everything set up for the start.

265
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yes, that's what the...

266
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That's what the situation was, was getting set up at the start.

267
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But thankfully now, oh, my mother was gone.

268
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Thankfully now everything is like set up.

269
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So I don't have to do fucking anything, okay?

270
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It is incredibly difficult and tiring to change someone else's format.

271
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Don't let the shadow people in your head get you, who's mad at the girls?

272
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Well, we got one fucking fanny, and whoever you are, I don't know if you're listening.

273
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Eh, but we got one fanny, started criticizing the girls by sending a message on the website.

274
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Didn't we eat an absolute fucking fanny?

275
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And I'm not being funny, you know for a fact these girls I've never recorded before.

276
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
They're like, eh, no, the deals are this, all the deals are that.

277
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Fucking come complaining on the website, aye.

278
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So the development team can all fucking read this shit.

279
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
As if I fucking passed on the message to the girls, like, didn't be a fanny.

280
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's the first time they've ever recorded these types of audios before.

281
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Like, I'm not having it, I'm not having it.

282
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Mummy's not happy.

283
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Like, I just can't be yours to folk like that.

284
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So I'm kind of fighting ghosts and then I'm fighting one fucking mom.

285
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I shouldn't say that, but I really can't be yours when someone's like,

286
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
what do you mean any girls aren't producing a 10 out of 10 audio

287
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
when they're very first day and fucking feel literally go get to fuck, man.

288
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Get the fuck, go post your audio first and let us all dog pile it at once.

289
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Like, go get to fuck.

290
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Sorry, I'm like straight up fighting.

291
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You would be surprised how unbelievably fucking rude some fannies are.

292
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Anyway, who is it? Oh, someone who obviously was anonymous on the website

293
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
leaving their dog shit feedback, honestly.

294
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And the girls didn't produce a 10 out of 10.

295
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Oh, I can hear the girls breathing in one of the audios.

296
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yeah, because they have a pair of fucking lungs on them, maybe.

297
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm so sorry, I hate to break it to you, but I've actually got two lungs.

298
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Sorry that they didn't get an operation when they got one lung.

299
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Or fucking speaking to a ventilator, like, go get a fucking grip, man.

300
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Where's my pitchfork, honestly?

301
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
We need your mommy to reach through it, so why?

302
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Is it weird when I get angry?

303
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The only time I get angry and start fighting is when someone's talking about the girls,

304
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm like, alright then.

305
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I bet we'll all listen to you fucking knee-lungs McGee over there

306
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
bet you're on a fucking ventilator and a wheelchair, you little cripple bastard.

307
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Because you can't even fucking form a thought.

308
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
That's a fucking abstract concept.

309
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
But we banned fucking Denny breathing the audios.

310
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
They're breathing in the audios.

311
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'll get a fucking fuck off, mate.

312
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Did you imagine complaining about breathing?

313
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Ugh, what is this?

314
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm sorry, you have to deal with it, but the silver lining is

315
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
that your frustration, we learn worse colors.

316
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
We love keeping totally not to make our community worse, honestly.

317
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Better to say most of them have been a bit dimples in their eyes.

318
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'll leave in a wee dislike.

319
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Ugh, you're breathing to make a little too hard to stream be.

320
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Strong and hot when she is a little...

321
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
No, let's just protect the mommy coming out.

322
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Honestly, so I'm on the feedback, I'm like...

323
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm not being funny.

324
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I wish I could do this.

325
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I wish I could bring the fannies on that say something negative, bring them on,

326
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
get them to say out loud their little criticism, and be like,

327
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
no, no, no, no, no, say exactly how you said it before.

328
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And then I'll just fucking elate them on fire.

329
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Not literally, I meant elate them on fire with being like,

330
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
it wouldn't actually be fucking realistic out here.

331
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So first of all, like, one of the first assignments the girls got was

332
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
their microphones had to be delivered.

333
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Half of these girls have been using these microphones for two seconds.

334
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Okay, these girls have no experience with these microphones,

335
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
and that's perfectly okay.

336
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Everyone has to start somewhere, okay?

337
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I popped their little microphone cherries on half of this shit.

338
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Anyway, like, oh, no, sorry, I'm starting to get fat.

339
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm not even doing ASMR.

340
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
This happens every time.

341
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Oh, and label it a fucking ASMR team.

342
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And I just start getting fucking rigid in the middle of it.

343
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Sorry, I'm actually one of them.

344
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I like, when Strenny vints and anchors in around check,

345
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
constant check, and my monkey brain is like,

346
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Scorch!

347
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Light all of them on fire and maincraft.

348
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Yes, maincraft.

349
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Strenny makes fun of a hate comment stream.

350
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I feel like the amount of swearing, if I even set up that stream,

351
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
like, if I was, I don't know, I don't think we're,

352
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I don't know what's gonna happen with Marshmallow,

353
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
but it'd just be like, alright, haters, time for me to make content,

354
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
for you to pay my bills, leave a hate comment about anything,

355
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
about failure, and then it just turns into a skit,

356
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
it's a funny cramp.

357
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Like, there's no way in heck I would get through that stream

358
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
without being, like, absolutely screaming down the mic

359
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
in five minutes, being like, don't be so fucking stupid.

360
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
How you fucking do it?

361
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Do you honestly think this is how I worth finding things?

362
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
How you fucking do it?

363
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
That's so dead, like, no.

364
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Like, I'd absolutely, like, everyone would be like,

365
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
what the fuck?

366
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
How does someone so small have so much rage inside of her?

367
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Getting protective of her children is extremely hot.

368
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You'd probably get targeted for harassment

369
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
if I did something like that.

370
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I mean, shit, we're getting harassed.

371
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
We're fucking breathing in the mic.

372
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Daileys get so post-it.

373
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Nah, these aren't real strong, I take your words.

374
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
That would actually be fine.

375
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
We need art and all that sort of outfit.

376
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
A strong ghost hunting, which is punching us.

377
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Someone said, hire a manager to screen marshmallows.

378
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
To spend money to get anonymous comments is pretty rough,

379
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
if I'm being honest.

380
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Dr. King, thank you for the membership.

381
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I appreciate it.

382
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And then there's a few more.

383
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I mean, you know the drill.

384
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Clearly they've never seen a Chihuahua.

385
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Oh, are you calling me a Chihuahua?

386
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Because I'm we in region.

387
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I would listen to the veiler through your mic.

388
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I don't even see them.

389
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I don't own the company.

390
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Oh no, she's shadowboxing again.

391
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Type of YouTube admin, not you though.

392
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Small being read.

393
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'll cover that for a manager.

394
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Man, I must get in my tributes.

395
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I hate it here.

396
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Just be spending money to protect the girl's mental health.

397
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Well, so the upkeep of the company is like nothing next to nothing.

398
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
But if it's like, oh, we need to pay a whole other person to go through these marshmallows.

399
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Like, I know it's very nice being able to give like anonymous comments and stuff and feedback on that.

400
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And like, don't get rid of them for now.

401
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But like, it's just another expense.

402
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And the whole set up of the 820 split is like, the girls can do whatever extra they want with the money.

403
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Because obviously the average agency is like 50 or less, I guess.

404
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Not that kind of 50 or less.

405
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I said the 50-50 or whatever.

406
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You know what I mean?

407
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
They just transfer the cognate hazards to the person's people screen.

408
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
You can relax by using all your rage while you have fun.

409
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Wonderful firecrackers, sirens.

410
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
The other has a very positive and tight-knit community, so far it's been good though.

411
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You know, their mental fortune is better than we do.

412
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Yeah.

413
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It would lose a lot of charm, knowing that there's like a literally a third party.

414
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Yeah, so that I would actually agree with that as well.

415
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Like, imagine being like, oh, I've sent my tentacotta mummy.

416
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And then it's like, it's some poor guy that we're paying.

417
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
We're paying has to like, rate your tentacle.

418
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Like, this is high enough quality.

419
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
The man whimpered, here you go, Strani.

420
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
The reefling whimpered, here's the link.

421
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Can you listen?

422
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
You can sit down, your mirrors are open.

423
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Yes, yes, yes.

424
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I just let things simmer first.

425
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I mean, do you want VLR management for your pack or your little tentacle?

426
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,000
My morning voice, my woke up seven minutes before stream voice after the nap.

427
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Yeah.

428
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Or pay like, let me see if I can tap your ears a little.

429
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

430
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Anywhere.

431
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Um, here in the afternoon.

432
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
My tentacle is a Strani exclusive.

433
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Sounds good.

434
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,000
So I managed to get mech assault work in, so we're definitely on for a mech assault stream.

435
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Um, I'm taking a pause for a week on Elden Ring.

436
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Um, and just because we have two insurance streams over in Scape, to try and bash out these wines.

437
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
But I'm getting nervous, I don't know if I can do it.

438
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I freaking saw Narissa from Hollow Live is doing prayer.

439
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And I think she's doing the altar as well with dragon bones and getting, and getting, uh, it's not Jailbirds for Narissa.

440
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Wait, is it Jail? No.

441
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Um, to like, run her dragon bones.

442
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Oh mommy, I saw the new thumbnails there, correct? I want to use them as a desk, huh?

443
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yeah.

444
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I'd admit it, the real reasons, the reasons can help finish the DLC for you.

445
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
All right, mech assault one and two, my child.

446
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
They made a mech assault two.

447
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I don't think they made a mech assault two.

448
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Okay, well we approve comments together on YouTube.

449
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
RuneScape is, Strani is the RuneScape chance there.

450
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Yeah, it's Jailbirds.

451
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Ah, newest Jailbirds. That's right, I know my features.

452
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I was a very brave girl yesterday on Twitter, and I applied myself for one of those trends,

453
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:36,000
where it's like, put your model, and we might do, it's by Frame and Ebay Shrimp,

454
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
and they're making Wim Tattoos, so I posted my full model view,

455
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
which a lot of people don't get to see.

456
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It's on my Twitter, the link's in the description.

457
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
If you just check out my replies on Twitter, you'll see it,

458
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
because yeah, I do not show the full view of my, is this room dark enough?

459
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Maybe the room is dark enough for me to get away with it, hold on.

460
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Hi, I'm Strani, this is my room.

461
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I don't show it often for reasons, but yeah, this is me.

462
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
How did I do that?

463
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
You're supposed, no, microphone.

464
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Sorry.

465
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
The microphone's not supposed to go big.

466
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
But yeah, I don't normally show that, because, yeah.

467
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
That was a brave girl, and, oh, that was a brave girl,

468
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
and like, put myself under one of those posts,

469
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
because I'm like, oh, hi, I'm Strani, I'm a weirdo,

470
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
but thank you for the opportunity for the Wim Tattoos.

471
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Wim Tattoos, it's just a Scottish flag, honestly, if they even knew that.

472
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I'd be very surprised if they knew I was Scottish.

473
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And then I sent a VTuber, a message, a DM request for an ASMR collab,

474
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
but I sent it to someone that doesn't follow me, but that has open DMs.

475
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And they were like, oh, looking to make friends.

476
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Oh, wait, I'm gonna do it.

477
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
They were looking to make friends, and I asked for an ASMR collab.

478
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I'm a fucking twat.

479
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
She was asking to make pals, no fucking compatriots.

480
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Wim Tattoos that says, no got a fucking clue what that means.

481
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
It's a microphone now.

482
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I thought you were going to intentionally have them make cover of the area.

483
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Ooh, I'm happy, I knew I was such a brave girl.

484
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
But yes, we have a member's script writing stream.

485
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I'll see how it gets received.

486
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
If it gets received well, that'll help out a lot.

487
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm not even pretending, that'll help out so much.

488
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I have you guys script writing streams, because it looks so bad.

489
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:45,000
But I made so much progress yesterday, and then I get to do the next seven group collabs.

490
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:55,000
That may or may not be on a certain feature-proof ASMR account.

491
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Peaches, it's peaches, I can't show up, it's peaches, I peaches.

492
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I mean, you can make friends over ASMR.

493
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I know that whenever I do a message for ASMR, I'm always super up front, and I'm just like,

494
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Hi, I'll make the collab, and I'll write it, and I'll edit it, and everything else that we don't buy me.

495
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I'm a professional relationship type thing.

496
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Don't forget about the stream delay during member's stream?

497
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Yeah, you guys can tell me what you want me to put.

498
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'll do the b-paul thing, if you want to.

499
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Me, I see a certain sense.

500
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Wait, the seven man collab line up?

501
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Hold on, let me type in the name.

502
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Oh, my stomach is-

503
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:03,000
It's up, it's breaking up, okay.

504
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
The girl's seven man collab is all those boo-boo-boo-boo.

505
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:20,000
If you want to hear seven ASMR girls together, you can open that up and then pause on the side if you want.

506
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And leave it a like when you listen to it and stuff.

507
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Okay, so that's the second of four seven man ASMR collabs.

508
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
The next one is peaches.

509
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
As in dream of peaches, yeah.

510
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But you can open that up.

511
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Yes, demon in me.

512
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I think the girls might make a solo ASMR roleplay with the look or something.

513
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Because the art came out pretty good.

514
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Unfortunately, Jaffa Redwood's colour blind and he keeps fucking me up.

515
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You can listen to that later, alligator.

516
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Make sure to like and subscribe.

517
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Yeah, if you like ASMR, you can subscribe to me by the way.

518
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I have lots of ASMR coming.

519
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Okay, I'm going to approve of comments on YouTube.

520
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I will read them out to you.

521
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Four minutes ago, someone commented H on my short.

522
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
That just came out, so I'll approve that.

523
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Someone posted on the Mamusa collab a sleeping emoji.

524
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
We will approve.

525
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Someone on my debut, but posted double of hearts.

526
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Feels good man.

527
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I have a treat for you all this Saturday.

528
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I hope you're ready for Saturday.

529
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
There's a treat on everyone's channel on Saturday.

530
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
So look out for that.

531
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:21,000
It will be on everyone's channel and it will come out like 10 minutes apart.

532
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So you have to watch as they get released totally.

533
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
That's how it works, right?

534
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
What is approving comments?

535
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,000
So when you comment on my channel, it disappears, but it doesn't really.

536
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,000
It shows up in my little approval section and I get to read all the comments and approve them.

537
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
So I quite literally read every single comment.

538
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Someone says, Microsoft, that brings back memories on my schedule.

539
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Someone's saluted the clapping without hands.

540
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
It's a more video because it got deleted.

541
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Someone said, power claps are over 9000.

542
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Someone says, you know you have a giant cake when you make this kind of noises down.

543
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
That broke the sudden barrier.

544
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I got you and enjoyed it.

545
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Oh my lord, the cake is not a lie.

546
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Nope, we aren't doing portal out here.

547
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It's all in the thighs safely.

548
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And then someone said rip to the actual original clapping video.

549
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Am I working on more?

550
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I'm like, yes.

551
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
So I see an Emmy haven't been approved and they're being made.

552
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I've sent away Shibi's request.

553
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I need to get Azura to tell me what batch attend she wants and then I need to use my brain power.

554
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
If someone can tweet me what my emotes were in batch 2, that'd be great.

555
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I don't have access to Marshmallow because someone did it on Marshmallow.

556
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Let's see.

557
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Why does listening to your talk make my head spin?

558
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Is it because I'm Scottish?

559
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Is it because it's weird here?

560
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Words said a bit differently.

561
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I'm excited for Among Us with Yume Plus.

562
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Oh, you're gonna hear the wrath of the Scots real quick and that's true.

563
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
That's where one of them accuses me of being it when I'm not it.

564
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
When someone accuses me of being it when I'm not it, I'm like absolutely screaming region.

565
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Me when I'm it but accusing someone else of it.

566
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I've got my latex gloves on.

567
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Can you tell I've got a latex glove on?

568
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Yeah.

569
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
What's the tentacle on the wall for anyway?

570
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
It's totally decorational.

571
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
We're not wearing functional hair again.

572
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Okay.

573
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Today is Patra's day so you have three streams today

574
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
and you're already listening to one of them right now.

575
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Good to me.

576
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I promise I'm a certified nurse.

577
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I'm just checking out your ears to make sure you've got good tail in your ears.

578
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And what about this ear?

579
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
This ear clearly is deficient in tingles.

580
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I know what I can do in order to fix this.

581
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I will administer five cc's of tingles to hold your breath mister.

582
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I'll save you.

583
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Okay.

584
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Wow.

585
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
What are you gonna do with them glues?

586
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Nurse Ronnie's will the tingles result in a main break?

587
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Yeah?

588
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Yeah, main break.

589
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Today's more script stream goes well.

590
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Maybe we can write a main break together

591
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
and I'll show you our hypnosis stuff.

592
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Okay, let me inspect your ear again for any tingles.

593
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Wow.

594
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Okay, you tingled a little bit.

595
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Can you feel my breath on your ear?

596
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
We need to administer even more tingles.

597
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
What can we do?

598
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I'm looking.

599
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Why?

600
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I can clean them.

601
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I'd like me to pick up my handy-dandy tool

602
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
because you need to tingle or else you're gonna perish for some reason.

603
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:12,000
In the world's 26th day, if you do not tingle once a day, you fall into a coma.

604
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Surely she wouldn't make the break.

605
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
If you were a nurse, I would always want to be sick.

606
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Any chance the girls will play a game together?

607
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Yes, we actually posted it in the discord.

608
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
So, quite possibly.

609
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Okay.

610
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I think you're tingling a little, so I'm returning to normal in this ear,

611
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
which is good news.

612
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Very, very good news.

613
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Yes.

614
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Wow, wow, wow.

615
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
There we go.

616
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Slow and steady went to tingle it.

617
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Breathing a little.

618
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Please make me gentle.

619
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I have no idea how this among us collapse is gonna go.

620
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I was like, so when, if you didn't know, I'm gonna teach you.

621
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Okay?

622
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I'm gonna teach you the insider knowledge, which is when you do group collabs or collabs of that nature,

623
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:57,000
you show up one hour before this stream time to sort out any connection problems of a discord DM.

624
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Always makes me nervous.

625
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I'm like, oh god, the girls okay?

626
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Okay, the girls are not dying.

627
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
This is fantastic news.

628
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I love it when the girls aren't dying.

629
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
It's my favorite thing.

630
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I was getting so nervous.

631
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I'm like, why have I been ahead?

632
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Every day I come.

633
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Oh, sorry.

634
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I should have finished that sentence there.

635
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Every day I come home and get stuck locked by VLR ASMR streams.

636
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yeah.

637
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Bro, can I say that every collab is so unlucky?

638
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
It's like every...

639
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Bro, I am still so mad at the pepper washer devs.

640
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Not only do they lock free play mode multiplayer behind the campaign,

641
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
we can't even connect each other.

642
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Am I made it safely?

643
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Is she in the Bahamas or some shit?

644
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I don't even know where she is.

645
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
She just put on the team-up schedule.

646
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I'm away and I'm like, as long as you're safe,

647
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
that's all that's important to me as long as you have fun.

648
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I actually don't know where she's looking like.

649
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Amy's in heaven otherwise.

650
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
It's like I can still hear her.

651
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
What do you mean?

652
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I'm right here, big brother.

653
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Amy, are you not supposed to be on holiday?

654
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Oh, yeah, sometimes.

655
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Amy, go be on holiday and relax.

656
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
My main place would be...

657
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Sometimes I can still hear her voice.

658
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Amy, Amy, are you there?

659
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Yeah.

660
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Oh, who the fuck?

661
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I'm communicating with her right now telepathically.

662
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Amy, what do you want to say to the pentpals?

663
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Thank you for denying me.

664
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Amy, Amy, you can't say that out loud.

665
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
That's the quiet part out loud.

666
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Maybe it's Jill.

667
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Amy, I'm sure.

668
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
It's like she never left.

669
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Amy, is that you?

670
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Is it so cold out here?

671
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Ah, fuck it, why not?

672
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Right, Amy, what kind of tingle do you want to do?

673
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I don't have a fucking clue.

674
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Alright, Amy, that doesn't help this collab.

675
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Fuck it, we'll do something, alright?

676
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Have a boo, you kiss the pentpals.

677
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
You know?

678
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Well, that collab went well, don't you think?

679
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
That was the quickest and easiest collab in my life.

680
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Now I can clickbait this stream with Amy's shoulder on it real quick.

681
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
There's just Amy and the Beast.

682
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
There's just Amy and the Beast in the room with us.

683
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Strongly, the accident was a year ago.

684
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
You have to let Amy go.

685
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
No, not my little sister.

686
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I've pressed down on your ears a little bit.

687
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I've pressed on your ears a little bit, okay?

688
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Amy, see me?

689
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Went into a power washer.

690
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I think power washer would have to be a four-man collab.

691
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
As soon as we got more than four people in the game,

692
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
the game was like no avana.

693
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
No one can collab with me at this time, ever.

694
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I'll do it myself.

695
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I say, I say, come in for a minute.

696
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
No, what do you want?

697
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Strongly, I'm tired.

698
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I just finished streaming.

699
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I see, I see, do you want to hear it again?

700
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I'm going to do some more ASMR.

701
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
But Strongly, my voice is broken.

702
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I can't.

703
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Right, well, I tried.

704
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I tried Snow Berries, but AC can't make it.

705
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Strongly, you just went near all of these.

706
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
That's it, I'll get Azura, and hold on.

707
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Azura?

708
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Azura?

709
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
They're one, yeah.

710
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
To do more ASMR with me.

711
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I look good when I'm pressing Azura, it's just a moment.

712
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Oh wait, no, I said no.

713
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Oh no.

714
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Wait a minute, how am I typing in chat right now?

715
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
This isn't possible.

716
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
You're teasing us, are you?

717
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
What the fuck are you typing in chat?

718
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I don't stream at the same time.

719
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
AC, how are you?

720
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Do you got your phone out?

721
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
No.

722
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Someone's pretending to be me on stream.

723
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
The whole ASMR is stopped here, and there's already so much of it.

724
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
AC is feeding the masses with ASMR.

725
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Literally, my impression of Azura is just...

726
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I can't.

727
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:29,000
My sweet, bleeding heart.

728
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
That's a bit of it, I know.

729
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Strongly is joystick there too.

730
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Yeah, they're long with one little bit of it.

731
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
As well as Karambit.

732
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
And Strongly365.

733
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Oh, the terrible one.

734
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Hold on, I'll chat to the latex.

735
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Azura's too mummy for you.

736
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Would you mean my deadpan accent?

737
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Can you do our mouth voice?

738
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Would you, I mean, no.

739
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I just don't stream, what's going on?

740
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I'm pretending to be all...

741
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
No, sorry, I'm proving that I'm all avirable right now.

742
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Amy was on stream earlier, you just missed it by a ball here.

743
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Actually, she's just gone away on holiday,

744
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
she's just jumped on the plane, but she was in my room as I had to go.

745
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Oh, it's Stacy Milka, and how can you forget?

746
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Wait, we'll see if I can get Amy again,

747
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
even though she's on a plane right now.

748
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Amy.

749
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
What the fuck is Amy's voice again?

750
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Hold on.

751
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Big brother.

752
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
It's actually just called V strongy, this company's a veil.

753
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
It's not real.

754
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Strongy can't hurt you.

755
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Strongy with her 18 billion personas.

756
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Azura's natural rasp is hard to nail.

757
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Oh yeah, do you want me to fuck it?

758
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I'm gonna go put on Azura right now.

759
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Azura de ule de lu e.

760
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Okay, so I've typed in Azura de lu e, so over for you fuckers.

761
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Let's see, live.

762
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Ah, Azura de ule de lu e.

763
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
That's a new short out, let's go.

764
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Right, let's see what her ASMR was.

765
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Don't be afraid to talk in this video, Azura.

766
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Okay, Azura actually doesn't talk much in her fucking reals,

767
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
it's just a stray then.

768
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
So I can mimic her voice.

769
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Azura shy, geez.

770
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I'm gonna have to spank her.

771
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Hey Azura, you need to start talking in your streams more

772
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
so I can mimic you during an ASMR section of mine.

773
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Thanks, that'd be great.

774
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
You know what, I'm gonna put our trailer on,

775
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
because I know for a fact she speaks in her trailer.

776
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Get route, videos.

777
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Trailer, let's go.

778
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I hope you still have room in your heart

779
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
for a coach goddess like me.

780
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
For I am Azura de ule,

781
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
and I hope you can join me soon

782
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
on some tantalizing discussions together.

783
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I'm just drew a copy in her trailer.

784
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I played it, I don't know, I mean,

785
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

786
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I played it, I don't know.

787
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Yeah, I know, I'm muted to death though.

788
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Her late is short, should I give her her late is short ago?

789
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Someone told me

790
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
my voice is so soothing

791
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
that I could read out a dictionary.

792
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
So we're going to try today.

793
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Says Veeler here.

794
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I'm all of Veeler.

795
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Okay, there we go.

796
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Oh, that's good.

797
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
What was that actually?

798
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Are you guys just hyping me up?

799
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Wait, are you guys being serious?

800
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Are you hyping me up or can I actually mimic Azura as well?

801
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
No Veeler, it's just, she is veeler.

802
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Holy goat, you're actually pretty good looking impressions.

803
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Oh, wait until you do that.

804
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I'm going to hear Marcia's lovely impression.

805
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I'm going to shit you up with her.

806
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
It's funny, Azura sounds like someone else.

807
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
No, you're supposed to say I sounded like her.

808
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Right today,

809
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
and that means

810
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
to make something better.

811
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
You actually sounded like her.

812
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Hype me up, hype me up, give me more delusions,

813
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
give me more personas.

814
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Veeler will decide your fate.

815
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I am Veeler.

816
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Boy, better than expected.

817
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Now try Mercy Modest.

818
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Sorry, I'll try Mercy Modest.

819
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Mercy Modest.

820
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I think Marcia's the only accent that doesn't compliment me.

821
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Which is terrible.

822
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Right, let's listen to a short from Marcia.

823
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Okay.

824
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Sorry, don't send that easily.

825
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Don't worry.

826
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Oh, but she's like, I'm trying on solar.

827
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
What's her trailer?

828
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Debut and turn first?

829
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
What better story than that of a modest young student?

830
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
No, she's not like that.

831
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Turn violent and dairy overnight.

832
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Mercy's pretty unique, that's hard.

833
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I didn't always look...

834
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I've not gone up.

835
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Mercy's too really difficult.

836
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Mercy's really difficult.

837
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
She...

838
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I can do Mercy's laugh like that.

839
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Sorry, that was really loud.

840
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
So now you already have a mommy voice when you talk to yourself.

841
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Someone was like, you're disappointed.

842
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Mommy voice like, shit me up in your fucking...

843
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
On your...

844
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Elden Ring stream.

845
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
They were like, scared of how disappointed I sounded.

846
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Can we hear your best straw necks?

847
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Fuckin' thing.

848
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I'm Scottish.

849
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Mercy's too yandere in my mic, unless you're also yandere.

850
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Do your catchphrase.

851
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I'm Mercy Modest, and on my ass you will feast.

852
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
That's not my kohei, just a manic laughter.

853
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Gosh, Scottish girls make me melt.

854
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Actually, too, will be.

855
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Try Shavey.

856
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Right, let's...

857
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Oh, I need a fart.

858
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Attuded.

859
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I just want to report for any bread breakers.

860
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I'm technically on day five.

861
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Give up for day five of having constipation.

862
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Right, Shavey.

863
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Shavey, get out of there, out in the open.

864
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Okay, let's listen to her debut.

865
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Oh fuck, she's deep voiced as well.

866
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Like, I knew that about...

867
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Oh, hold on.

868
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I'm Shavey Cottonbum, the madam of the sister...

869
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Ah, fuck, I don't have that.

870
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I hope I can take off a lot of boxes for you.

871
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Such as ropes, milk, bunny.

872
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Yeah, I know, I get that.

873
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
No shit dune challenge.

874
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Starting at some point, it's gonna need to be scooped out.

875
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Do you know why it's called the scooping room?

876
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
It's because you scoop shit in it, you dumbass.

877
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Sister location for Netflix hilarious.

878
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
And I won't have any other...

879
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
...literations.

880
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Get to day nine and you can pretend it's just straight up gender.

881
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Bro, my stomach is so big right now.

882
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Yeah, you need to really deep for Shavey.

883
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
You do a good mouth voice.

884
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
You want a Scottish mouth? How do I do a Scottish mouth?

885
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Well, I know how to do a Scottish mum.

886
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Away and fucking clean your room.

887
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
That's a Scottish mum, but not a Scottish mouth.

888
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Oh, darling, have you been naughty?

889
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Or do you need to clean your room?

890
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Or are you needing a mouth like me to come in and help you?

891
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I can do lots for you.

892
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Pinned over the bed and pick up all the stuff that's on the rack.

893
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
For half a year some more, man.

894
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Yeah, what do we do?

895
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Join the animatronic family.

896
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
We open the rail soon.

897
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Your tummy's big, sorry, my bad.

898
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
A circus baby.

899
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Do you know why?

900
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
It's called the scooping room.

901
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I just love the way she says it.

902
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
It's like, you fucking idiot.

903
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Well, I wasn't ready for the mummy video.

904
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I need to renew my passport.

905
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Why do you need to renew your passport?

906
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:24,000
What triggered in your head to need to renew your passport in this monster?

907
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
How many days will you get before the doctor?

908
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Oh, I just need to give my...

909
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Not to be nasty.

910
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:40,000
But if you ever have trouble with your back door,

911
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
just get a little enema kit.

912
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Enema, enema, give them an enema.

913
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I'm really stuck.

914
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Because if you like playing in the back door,

915
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,000
that's what you do.

916
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Sorry, your mouth voice is too powerful.

917
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
That's hostile.

918
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
It's just the facts.

919
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Sorry, you're getting educated against your will.

920
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Okay.

921
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Oh, the face tracking thinks the ace cube,

922
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
the ace globe is my face.

923
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Hold on, it's missing up a little bit.

924
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Circus baby, you had to ask the Scottish scooping room

925
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
because you had to have a thing scooping in it.

926
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
It's not that complicated.

927
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Hey, Stroney, how's the stream don't...

928
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Don't, just don't.

929
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
How's the stream don't...

930
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Sorry.

931
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Just don't do it, stop it.

932
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
24 hours fast though,

933
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
if you have a lot planned, learn that hard way.

934
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
No, you don't need to fast.

935
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Minor spelling mistake.

936
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Spotted everyone pointing that.

937
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
We're kidding, I'm teasing.

938
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I think I might like the Scottish lady's voice,

939
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
because I'm Scots.

940
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Minor spelling.

941
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Teasing, I'm teasing.

942
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
My mouth is tracking to the ace globe.

943
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
You stop that.

944
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Go to fuck, they sleep.

945
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Go to fuck, they sleep.

946
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Oh, I'm doing a song cover.

947
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I might be able to do it

948
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
and record the raw vocals after.

949
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
The Yumi plus, if I don't go too crazy.

950
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Although basically whenever I finish streaming

951
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
for the day I go to bed now.

952
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Because I got so much work done.

953
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
So much work done yesterday.

954
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
It's recommended to fast if you go spelunkin'.

955
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Have a mesmerizing time, everyone.

956
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Wish I could stay for the script writing stream,

957
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
but I'm sure the time is fantastic.

958
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
It will be the stream will remain up,

959
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
because we'll use substitutes like tentacle and ink.

960
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
And we're just talking about honey tea.

961
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
That's all.

962
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I just need to make a little bit of honey tea.

963
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
We'll have my sleep on.

964
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Angry Scots talks you in a bed.

965
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
See you, you're another one.

966
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
You never sleep at night, what's going on with you?

967
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Like a frickin' insomnia.

968
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Don't be up on that male twin and gummies

969
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
that all them Americans are on about all the faking time.

970
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
No, let me talk you in real nice and tidy

971
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
and get your act up so you can faking go to sleep.

972
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Because I've had enough of you been awake all day.

973
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Faking clean the whole house.

974
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Clean the whole bloody house and what do I get in the town?

975
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Faking you coming over.

976
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Cuttin' faking toast on the bunker.

977
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
On the bunker, as if there's any plates available.

978
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
As if you can't just use a wee bit of kitchen roll.

979
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Do you know what the worst thing that really annoys me?

980
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
That you do.

981
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
See the fuckin' butter?

982
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
See the fuckin' butter?

983
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
When you make toast and then you use the knife

984
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
to spread the butter and then you put the knife back in the butter.

985
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
So now the butter has fuckin' toasty bread

986
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
comes all over it.

987
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Like it actually does matter to me.

988
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Anyway.

989
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
That's what Scottish Rage ASMR would sound like.

990
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Ugh.

991
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I'm frickin' struggling to find an artist as well.

992
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
To do all my crazy things.

993
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I've still not ordered the pregnancy artwork.

994
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
And...

995
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
I want it to come out a really good way

996
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
but I don't have an artist to do it.

997
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I want...

998
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
She's not acting anymore.

999
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Strutting the record.

1000
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Twisted crumbs and butter are the worst.

1001
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I'm sorry about the butter.

1002
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
She's not acting anymore.

1003
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
You know I'm not acting because my dad's coming over

1004
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
and that's exactly what he does.

1005
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
My mum used to get on it all the time for it

1006
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
and he used to be like,

1007
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
oh but I'm making toast for my breakfast

1008
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
before I go to work.

1009
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Like he didn't see the issue with having crumbly

1010
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
butter.

1011
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Alert of the classic lure pack fam.

1012
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
We love a bit of lure pack.

1013
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Pregnancy ASMR would be my best.

1014
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I know mum can cook literally tummy-sits

1015
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
and I'm saying how proud I am of you

1016
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
and I can't wait to see

1017
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
everything you accomplish in the world

1018
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
and how you navigate that

1019
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
and how big and strong you're gonna be

1020
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
and I'm gonna look forward to

1021
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
the sleepless nights that you keep me awake

1022
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
after you're born because

1023
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I know you're not always gonna be in the newborn stage

1024
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
before I know it you'll be walking

1025
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
you'll be babbling

1026
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
you'll start having your own personality

1027
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
and interest and it's gonna be so cute.

1028
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
And then I'm gonna get all emotional

1029
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
because I'll be like one day I'll hold you

1030
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
and then I'll never hold you again

1031
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
because you're all big and grown up

1032
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
my little weifling, no.

1033
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
But yes, I need to find an artist

1034
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
that's willing to draw something like that.

1035
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
If not I might have to go to Fiverr

1036
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
but Fiverr is always such a gamble

1037
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
and I don't want to gamble on the artwork

1038
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
because it means so much.

1039
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
To make it.

1040
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
The one where we're the father and the child?

1041
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Yes.

1042
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I'm not supposed to cry.

1043
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Stop it.

1044
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
No, don't cry.

1045
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
It's supposed to be like a fun goofy day or something.

1046
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
But yeah, if I get a good sleep

1047
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
after the Yumi Plus collab

1048
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
then I have a feeling

1049
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
that the next 2000 days

1050
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
some more collab's gonna be up.

1051
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
There's no one available on Skib.

1052
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I have never used Skib

1053
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
because apparently you can't even talk

1054
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
to the person in the commission

1055
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
and I'm like,

1056
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
if I'm paying for something

1057
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
and I'm not allowed any corrections

1058
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
unless I'm paying like a literally

1059
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
cheapest chips for it

1060
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I'm too scared to use Skib.

1061
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Like, per Emi

1062
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
she wanted some artwork Skib

1063
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
or something we're planning while she's away

1064
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
and then she was like,

1065
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
oh fuck it, I'll just draw it myself

1066
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
because she was like,

1067
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
it's gonna get too much of a headache

1068
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
because she was like,

1069
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
it's really unreliable

1070
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
because she,

1071
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I think she's used it before

1072
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
and it's unreliable or something.

1073
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
There's also Vegen.

1074
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I fucking hate Vegen.

1075
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
It's alright but I also hate it at the same time.

1076
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I really wanna take responsibility right now

1077
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
what, forget me pregnant

1078
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
and being in my tummy at the same time?

1079
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:38,000
It's the reason that Skib's actually really cheap.

1080
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Oh, maybe,

1081
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
maybe I should look at Skib.

1082
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I'd like to get the girls like artworks

1083
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
just like here and there like,

1084
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I don't know if you saw,

1085
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I got Mercy this artwork.

1086
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
It was just a doodle artwork

1087
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
so it's quite cheap overall.

1088
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
And it was her and Serenity together.

1089
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Why do you hate Vegen?

1090
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Because I thought so, since they were all,

1091
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
whenever I commissioned someone on Vegen,

1092
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I fucking messaged them on Twitter

1093
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
and asked for the commission

1094
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
because it's such a fucking nightmare.

1095
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Trying to like send the request off.

1096
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I'd rather message on Twitter and be like,

1097
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
are you gonna accept this request?

1098
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
If yes, like please let me know

1099
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
and I'll say like, here's my username

1100
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
on Skib, on Vegen.

1101
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Because I kind of be arse filling out

1102
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
the fucking, fucking mile long essay

1103
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
just for them to reject it.

1104
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I get why it's set up like that

1105
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
but I'm like, go and get to fuck honestly.

1106
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
We just got here,

1107
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
what are you people talking about?

1108
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
We're talking about making an artist request

1109
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
because I don't really have an artist

1110
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
that I want to draw me pregnant with a refling.

1111
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
There's no other way to say it.

1112
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I need to be drawn pregnant with a refling.

1113
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I'll always take responsibility

1114
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
with a refling.

1115
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Why do you know all of my buttons?

1116
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I absolutely hate those.

1117
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
It's terrible right now.

1118
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I'm cleaning your ear again.

1119
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Ah, because all the steps

1120
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I was thinking of trying to draw in Vegen.

1121
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
This is good.

1122
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I think if you're a creator on it

1123
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
it's very good.

1124
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Although there's been a lot of feedback

1125
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,000
about how it's like next time

1126
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
possible to get a refund.

1127
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
So yeah, oh my voice just cracked.

1128
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
All of the artists I've worked with

1129
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
ended up adding me on Twitter

1130
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
or Discord, it's just so much easier.

1131
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Honestly, the guy that made all our banners

1132
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
he's called Waltz with me

1133
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I'm like, would he be crazy enough

1134
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
to draw me pregnant with a refling?

1135
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I think he might.

1136
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
If I give him a reference.

1137
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I think I might ask Waltz with me

1138
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
to do the pregnant one.

1139
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
I'm trying to be given that hot-tooth.

1140
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Why doesn't Jaferero want to draw pregnant with me?

1141
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I've been...

1142
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Jaferero has been

1143
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
drawing me a bit manly

1144
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
the last few commissions

1145
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
and they came to keep having to correct

1146
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
and be like, please stop drawing me

1147
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
as a man.

1148
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Please stop drawing me if I was on Twitter.

1149
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
And it's kind of got to the point where it's like...

1150
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Yeah.

1151
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
So I'm kind of looking to spread my artist wings

1152
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
at the moment.

1153
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Try giving a reference.

1154
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Mysteries called Fish Peppers, I guess.

1155
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Yeah.

1156
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Waltz is good to work with.

1157
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
What?

1158
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
No, Jaferero would do...

1159
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Oh no, he's like there for anything else.

1160
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
And he's like, what do you want?

1161
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
And I'm like this and he's like

1162
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
okay, I guess.

1163
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
But yeah, recently

1164
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I've been getting drawn as a man

1165
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
like a big thick neck, a big massive chin

1166
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
and I'm like

1167
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
kind of corrected a few times

1168
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
and it's

1169
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
it's not really

1170
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
being changing.

1171
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
And I'm just like

1172
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
yeah.

1173
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
So yeah.

1174
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I'm going to try and spread my artist wings

1175
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
a little bit.

1176
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Then

1177
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I'm sure there'll be a few more things

1178
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
from Jaferero Pop.

1179
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
They can all be winners, you know.

1180
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
The style changed a bit.

1181
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Yeah, no, artist style changed all the time.

1182
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Which is not a problem

1183
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
but

1184
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
something that changes

1185
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
outside of like

1186
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
a barrel chest and huge arms

1187
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
the princess carry.

1188
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I'm not sure

1189
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
how many more to draw.

1190
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Yeah.

1191
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
So I'll see if

1192
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Waltz, I think Waltz is

1193
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Japanese.

1194
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I don't know if you guys

1195
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
know this but the Japanese

1196
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
yen is crashing.

1197
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Like

1198
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
absolutely crashing at the minute.

1199
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Maybe I should do skips

1200
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
but

1201
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
yeah, it's like completely crashing

1202
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
at the minute.

1203
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
So maybe yeah, skips would be

1204
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
way cheaper than usual but I've never used the

1205
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
website before.

1206
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
I hate

1207
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
having to learn how to use

1208
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
new websites.

1209
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
But

1210
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
I'm playing with the

1211
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
ball crusher.

1212
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Wait, the yen's crashing?

1213
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Yeah, like I think against the dollar

1214
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
the yen just continues to go down.

1215
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Like it's something weird.

1216
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I don't know why.

1217
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
It's a really good time to buy Japanese stuff.

1218
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Wow.

1219
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Good time to visit as well.

1220
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Up in

1221
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
the Sakura Park

1222
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
I feel like we'd be so disruptive though.

1223
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
We need to be quiet. We need to whisper.

1224
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
It's been down since Covid but it's currently

1225
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
at as low as it's like 50 cent time.

1226
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
The dollar.

1227
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
The what crusher?

1228
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
The ball crusher.

1229
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
I have this like sensory toy

1230
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
and I squish it and stuff

1231
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
and it feels really nice to squish.

1232
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
So it is being dubbed to the

1233
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
ball crusher.

1234
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Japan economy

1235
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
nothing great. I wonder if the birth rate

1236
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
of Japan is? I assume it's down as well.

1237
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Is there any first world

1238
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
country that doesn't

1239
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
have

1240
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
a declining birth rate?

1241
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I want to say no. Maybe?

1242
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
No. America.

1243
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
America as opposed to birth rate?

1244
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Maybe.

1245
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I'm not sure.

1246
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Anything above one is good.

1247
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
It is insufficient.

1248
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Time to leave to Japan and we'll be right to there.

1249
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Will we all go to Japan?

1250
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I don't know. Can you farm?

1251
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Yeah, you can farm in Japan.

1252
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
But I don't think they have castellos the way

1253
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Scotland has castellos.

1254
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Can you

1255
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
choose a nicer name

1256
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
than why I'm making you nervous?

1257
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Streamer has too much fun

1258
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
playing with the ball crusher.

1259
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
ASMR.

1260
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
America is on the down

1261
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
as well.

1262
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
I can take care of that declining birth rate.

1263
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I remember there was a post

1264
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
where it was like, I don't know if it was just

1265
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
an onion headline. Probably was, let's be

1266
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
honest. Of course that would fall for an onion

1267
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
headline. It was like Japan's

1268
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
declining birth rate

1269
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
makes visas

1270
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
for foreigners easier

1271
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
and then someone was like, step aside.

1272
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
This is a job for me.

1273
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
I'll fix the birth rate.

1274
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
But that's the thing about

1275
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
being a sperm donor. If you didn't

1276
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
know, you're actually not allowed to

1277
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
have more, you're not

1278
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
allowed to have more than

1279
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
20

1280
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
children, but someone

1281
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
recently, well not recently,

1282
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
it made the news like a year or so ago

1283
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
in America, he'd use

1284
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
different names at sperm banks, so he would have

1285
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
like a massive lineage

1286
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
and he got caught doing it. I don't know

1287
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
if he got jail time for it, because you're not

1288
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
supposed to pollute the pool like that

1289
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
or else it would be like a Genghis Khan moment.

1290
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Everyone's like, huh, how strange.

1291
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
We're all seem to be related to Genghis Khan, I wonder why.

1292
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
And it was like, my guy, have you

1293
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
even hair to half the stuff that man did?

1294
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Sorry, you clean

1295
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
your ears after all the filth I just

1296
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
spoke there, hold on.

1297
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Okay, there we go.

1298
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Much better.

1299
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Can't be speaking about

1300
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
that stuff right now, that's what we're

1301
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
revealing.

1302
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
That one guy

1303
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
that snuck around

1304
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
dozens of places, yeah,

1305
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
so you didn't know about it.

1306
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Japanese birth rate

1307
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
is so low that the previous prime minister

1308
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
became a meme

1309
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
for trying to boost the

1310
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
you would think

1311
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
immigration would be easier to the birth rate.

1312
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I heard that Japan's racism

1313
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
is pretty strong.

1314
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
It's just

1315
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
quite funny

1316
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
since it's like, that kind of seems

1317
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
like the solution.

1318
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
America's birth rate is only

1319
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
because of immigration.

1320
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
One of our states, Alabama,

1321
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
has had its first statewide population

1322
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
decline in the sense of

1323
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
speak more filth.

1324
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
We enjoy it.

1325
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
There's a reason his lineage

1326
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
spread far and wide.

1327
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Exactly.

1328
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
In a real article, Japan

1329
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
released a dating app

1330
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
for people who are looking for

1331
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
committed relationships to get married

1332
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
and have children.

1333
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
So like, the opposite

1334
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
of any other

1335
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Western countries

1336
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
dating apps.

1337
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Imagine hundreds of years later

1338
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
and there are historians wondering

1339
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
who this singular man

1340
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
who has a 20-way pattern formed

1341
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
or Japan is almost

1342
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
allergic to immigration.

1343
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I used to watch lots of videos

1344
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
from Japanese YouTubers.

1345
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
There's this girl called Shaila

1346
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
in Japan, or Shadamander.

1347
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
It's kind of like her nickname.

1348
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
And she talks about Japan a lot.

1349
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
She talks about running

1350
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
a bed and breakfast series, which is

1351
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
really cute. She renovated a house

1352
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
into like a Neko

1353
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
bed and breakfast and they were so

1354
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
cute.

1355
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
I find it quite sweet

1356
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
and adorable.

1357
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Japan started using China to

1358
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
increase the birth rate. That's sad.

1359
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Eh?

1360
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
You mean modern day?

1361
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Or do you mean

1362
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
the history we do not speak of?

1363
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Shinzo Abe

1364
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
is no longer asking.

1365
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
That reminds me, I made a meme for

1366
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Emi of that. I don't think she's ever posted it.

1367
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Before I met

1368
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
the girls, I made like a few memes for them

1369
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
each to post on Twitter if they wanted to

1370
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
because I was like, I have no idea what they want to do

1371
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
on Twitter. And one of the tweets

1372
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
is a, one of the

1373
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
meme pictures is Emi holding a gun

1374
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
and she's like, I'm no longer asking her

1375
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
things.

1376
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Japan has multiple dating apps for gamers

1377
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
and mates that are all owned and run by the

1378
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
government.

1379
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
It's giving

1380
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
date or you shouldn't have your hand

1381
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
over it.

1382
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
A declining birth rate is a good thing.

1383
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Our planet can't sustain all of us.

1384
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I, I thought

1385
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
our planet could sustain us is because

1386
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
of what we do to it. Like, we can't

1387
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
sustain. Not that we want

1388
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
infinite growth of humans, but

1389
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
like,

1390
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I thought

1391
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
someone

1392
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
draws vtuber's prego.

1393
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Are they cheap for this?

1394
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Are they gonna draw me holding my belly

1395
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
all happy

1396
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
in smiling and then a little

1397
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
rifling attached to me in like a

1398
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
little insane shot with a rifling

1399
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
in the umbilical

1400
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
card?

1401
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Are they gonna do it?

1402
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
You made memes for them?

1403
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,520
memes for them. I made memes, I wrote their ASMR scripts, I wrote some of the shorts.

1404
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:35,720
I think Amy's the only one that has shorts up that I didn't write like her story about

1405
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:40,600
that haunted house and she got grabbed in the middle of her sleep as she slipped next

1406
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:47,160
to her mum. She did some stuff that I didn't make. But everything else the girls have done

1407
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:51,880
I made. And they're all kind of waiting on me, but I'm going to spank them and be like

1408
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:57,760
ok, your debut period is over now, you need to start thinking about doing stuff for yourself

1409
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:03,600
because I can't be doing it for everyone. But yes, I tried to set them up as best I

1410
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:08,440
can and it certainly worked out. If we've all hit 5000 subscribers in our first month

1411
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:15,560
that's fantastic. Pregnancy is kind of so wholesome, I don't know why it has a stigma.

1412
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:20,160
Probably because the child is a parasite on the woman. Did you know that the reason why

1413
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:25,440
women forget that childbirth is so painful is because that's an evolutionary trait to

1414
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:30,760
trick you into wanting more children. Even though it's the most traumatic experience

1415
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:35,840
and most dangerous thing you will ever go through in your entire life as a woman.

1416
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:43,000
Eee-dee! Science Facts with Stormy. Would you like more science facts about pregnancy?

1417
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:49,920
The child, the body diverts as much nutrition to the child first or parasite as I like to

1418
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:56,360
call it. Which leaves some mothers who lose their teeth, lose their hair, lose some of

1419
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:05,360
their sight. Yeah, it's pretty rough if you want to be pregnant out here.

1420
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:17,240
Teach them how to fish. Biology 101. Yes, pregnancy is absolutely terrifying. If you

1421
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:24,320
actually know what goes on behind, how easy it is to hemorrhage, die in childbirth. Even

1422
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:32,200
C-sections, how it leaves you with a lifelong inability. Pregnancy also damages your bladder,

1423
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:37,960
it also damages your back passage during the birth. You can quite literally create one

1424
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:48,080
singular rip in between the panini and the baby. So yeah, don't, don't recommend pregnancy.

1425
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:53,000
Congrats if you want to go through it. It will turn your nips brown. That's the only thing.

1426
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:02,160
So if you're used to them being pink, don't be surprised. They change color. Life is just

1427
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:10,440
suffrax and honestly, do not be a whammin' and do not get pregnant is my advice. I was

1428
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:14,240
in the room when my youngest bro was being birthed. It's a horror for, oh, it is not

1429
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:20,840
for the faint of heart. It is not. And like, if we're not memin' for a second, you know

1430
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:25,360
how the meme's like, oh, would you rather get punched in the balls or birth a child?

1431
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:36,040
And then like, oh, I'm a C-section baby. You're removed like a chipper. That's a fact

1432
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:42,600
why I've never heard before. Oh, it's so dangerous. It's unbelievably dangerous. Wait,

1433
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:48,880
what did I just come into? I'm currently ranting about how dangerous pregnancy is whilst trying

1434
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:57,480
to harass an artist to draw me pregnant with you. So you're gonna be in my tummy and I'm

1435
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:02,400
gonna make a weird ASMR where you hear my tummy sounds and I'm talking to you and saying

1436
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:11,120
how much I love you and I can't wait till you should come out and achieve all these things.

1437
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:21,240
My nips are already brown. Well, then you make me a different race than me, then. Unfortunately,

1438
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:27,640
I'm as pale as they come. My nips practically blend in, honestly. Sorry, this isn't an ASMR.

1439
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:39,640
I'm just fucking ranting about pregnancy. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Did you guys get DM'd

1440
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:45,800
by that feature that wants you to draw a pregnant tooth? Trying to get around Vore, but still

1441
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:53,800
want to use the sense that it's pregnant, eh? There's a reason diet and childbirth is a

1442
01:28:53,800 --> 01:29:02,160
common trope. It is. You can also get a thing called coffin birth. If a mother who is, her

1443
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:08,600
ego is pregnant when she passes away and so does the child, the buildup of guesses actually

1444
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:15,480
expelled the child on that has been dubbed coffin birth. Just thought you should know.

1445
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:22,040
Not very nice. Aye. What's that? I'm just like an endless source of repeating things I've

1446
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:34,040
heard or learned. Sheesh. Okay, let me actually do this. I'm sorry for freaking you about

1447
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:39,480
the facts about me being pregnant after you made me pregnant. Refling, okay? I'll stop

1448
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:43,480
scaring you. Thank you for being brave, your mommy's bravest soldier.

1449
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:13,480
ASMR. Let's learn each front name and I'm not ASMR, because let's be honest. Wow.

1450
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,800
ASMR.

1451
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:31,800
Where's the Vore ASMR?

1452
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:45,240
I wanted to do giant test 4 with a zero. I didn't write the script yet. Well, I

1453
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,480
don't think I'll be writing the script the whole of this, right?

1454
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:57,320
I could definitely do a siren. Vore's you. Giant siren, because I'm a siren. But I'm

1455
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:03,160
actually a cowfish. See, I'm a siren that can't sing, so I had to use something else.

1456
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:07,800
And then I went for hypnotic abilities, so then I became a cowfish. I don't know.

1457
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:10,280
Don't ask about the lore. I didn't, I didn't come up with it.

1458
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:14,360
Is this what miski was here 24-7?

1459
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:21,240
Creasy, I think I just found out what coffin birth was today. Get educated, get educated, get educated.

1460
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:29,320
ASMR.

1461
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:48,440
Millen right now forever. I would prefer wholesome siren to bad ending siren.

1462
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:55,640
Where I just fucking hypnose you and tear a mouth and then keeps you in your stomach so you can't sleep.

1463
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:01,640
All your bases are belong to us. Okay, you ready? I'm gonna, I'm gonna swallow you right now.

1464
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,800
And then this says you're going down into my tummy, okay?

1465
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:31,640
You're in my tummy now. Do you hear my tummy?

1466
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:47,480
There's my tummy. It's making lots of noises.

1467
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:07,480
So basically, that's what the pregnancy ASMR is going to sound like, but I'm just complimenting you on that side.

1468
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:15,080
Oh, this is what it sounds like when I'm pregnant and you're safe in my tummy too.

1469
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:19,960
Oh, my little reef egg.

1470
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,480
Hot dog. This place is magnificent.

1471
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:31,800
Okay, well, let's spit you back out of my tummy now.

1472
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:40,200
I shouldn't have swallowed you. Okay, I'll bring you back up.

1473
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:48,680
I'll bring you back up my tummy, but first, first what?

1474
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:52,440
You get to listen to my heart, so I'm gonna do so.

1475
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:00,920
How much is the rent in here?

1476
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:20,280
Now, let's spit you out. You're already coming back up. You're back up in my heart now.

1477
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:21,880
I'm about to spit you out of my mouth.

1478
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:32,760
I don't want to go out the other way, exactly. Either I spit you out of my mouth,

1479
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:37,400
or you come out the other way. Your choice. And I'm already on day five of being backed up,

1480
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:39,640
so you'll be sitting for a while.

1481
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:49,880
Wait, it's all cold. I don't even have any cold.

1482
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:57,000
Okay, I think I'm ready to spit you out.

1483
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:14,600
I'm replaying. There you go. See, it didn't swallow you for long.

1484
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:18,280
That just reminded me. I need to order artwork of me eating you like a Calamari

1485
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:23,720
squid that's still alive. You know those Japanese fucked up mukbangs?

1486
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:27,080
Oh, wait, no, is it South Korean? I think it's South Korean. Or is it Chinese?

1487
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:33,720
Shit. I think one of them was a South Korean girl, and she was eating stuff alive.

1488
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:37,560
I just remembered I have to order an artwork like that as well.

1489
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:41,080
Oops, because I'm going to bore you alive.

1490
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:46,280
I've been on a mean way. I'm not going to chew, so I don't hurt you, okay?

1491
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:51,960
Oh, you don't want to be back out here? You want to be back on my tummy again?

1492
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:57,160
Oh, you should be.

1493
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:03,720
That was a fun read. Did you enjoy it? You're all slimy now, though. Hold on.

1494
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:07,480
I think I need to... I'm going to wait for you down, okay?

1495
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,680
Because you're all covered in musk, but I just need to...

1496
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:27,000
Did you hear my tummy? My tummy's asking for you to go back and say you're very king, but right now...

1497
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:36,040
What am I listening to? I just swallowed you, and then I just un-swallowed you.

1498
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:38,440
But now I'm cleaning the spit off of your ears.

1499
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:43,400
I'm sorry if you're used to AC's really cute ASMR.

1500
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:46,760
Here, we get a little freaky around these poles.

1501
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:52,440
AC, how about you tell them?

1502
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:56,680
Okay, so Strani's really fucking weird.

1503
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:05,000
I don't know why, but she just tries to make everyone happy,

1504
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,840
but it comes out with really inappropriate stuff.

1505
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:12,840
Thanks, AC, for that recap. I'll do it.

1506
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:16,120
You're welcome.

1507
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:20,840
Yeah, I do come out, actually. Thank you, AC.

1508
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:22,040
What?

1509
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:33,240
I need to get more of the spit off of your insomnia. There's so much spit.

1510
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:59,320
Okay, I think you're dry. Oh, that's pretty good. My wife is here.

1511
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:01,720
That's good enough to do it for her.

1512
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:10,360
I don't know, kind of. Actually, I get to find out in my RuneScape stream what kind of stuff the

1513
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:15,960
girls have been up to because I get to watch the girls. For Azura's one, I'm going to watch her

1514
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:21,880
monetization stream. I'm going to see if there's like two hours each girl has done,

1515
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:27,000
because if I watch two of her streams from each girl, that's 10 hours of RuneScape wings.

1516
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:31,160
And then I get to do a commentary on the girls.

1517
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:40,840
Yeah, I gave you a little species too. Just a test. Sorry if you hear me tell me.

1518
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:45,080
Just a test that it's a little dry. Yeah, you're dry.

1519
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:53,080
Okay, wow.

1520
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:09,080
When is Elden Ring the lore video watcher? There's lore videos on Elden Ring, aren't they?

1521
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:16,440
I love that you've collabed with Yunya. Well, it was probably a given, to be honest. It was

1522
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:20,920
probably a given. All things considered.

1523
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:34,200
Shibi is coming online in 20 minutes, right? Oh no, it's going to be on my tummy.

1524
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:51,320
Please tell me you're running the ASMR. You're running the experience.

1525
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:03,400
Did we finish the Elden Ring DLC? No, we're taking a break on it, because

1526
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:11,560
I've fucked my health up, so I can't do any more endurance for a few days.

1527
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:21,640
She says, as she has, what's coming up? I've got mechisol, which is apparently eight hours,

1528
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:28,760
but I don't believe it. And then I have membership ASMR, which is one tingle equals one clap.

1529
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:35,720
I thought that was quite creative myself. So you guys tell me whenever you tingle in the stream,

1530
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:43,640
and then I clap. In that way. There is a Mama Yunya collab. Yeah, you're allowed to watch it

1531
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:48,040
after I finish streaming, but if I redirect into Shibi, then you have to watch Shibi.

1532
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:56,120
Balthro, I don't know how long we're gonna go for, but I'm definitely gonna need to start being

1533
01:40:56,120 --> 01:41:04,760
a bit kinder to myself with the endurance streams until my health gets back, because I've been

1534
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:15,080
very silly. I'm not looking after myself. She says that she does three streams in a day, but

1535
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:20,920
it's not hard to do three streams because it's two hours at ASMR, which I'm literally just about to

1536
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:26,840
finish off. And then we're gonna write a script. I'm gonna go offline, make a cup of tea, get a

1537
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:31,880
cola, and then we're gonna write a script together, and then I'll gauge if you guys enjoyed it. Like,

1538
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:36,280
I'll do a poll at the end of the stream, and either you say you enjoyed it or you didn't enjoy it.

1539
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:41,480
And then I take a break, and then I put up with you, me plus, and I hope you're ready for the

1540
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:48,120
scrunch break. It's only seven days while we talk about your period here. You aren't gonna

1541
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:53,720
last clapping that much. I can do it by default. I don't have to do anything special to clap.

1542
01:41:55,720 --> 01:42:01,960
Like, do I need to- did you not see the new short? Hold on, I'm gonna link a short in chat.

1543
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:11,800
Okay, I'm gonna link a short in chat. It is 20 seconds long. You are welcome to watch it right now.

1544
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:17,480
Okay. You may watch this short. I give you permission to watch it.

1545
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:25,400
I'll wait 20 seconds. I'll just do blooping ASMR for 20 seconds whilst you watch that short

1546
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:26,520
that I've linked in chat.

1547
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:43,720
Wait, no VLR members streaming? Oh, no, it's gonna be. Oh, shit. Oh, yeah. Wait a minute,

1548
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:47,000
I forgot. People don't normally stream multiple times, and there's a lot.

1549
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:53,800
Once you're healthy again, keep looking after yourself. Challenge impossible. I want to play

1550
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:58,520
Elden Ring. I want to get carried. Carry me, carry me, carry me, plop, plop, plop.

1551
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:01,800
I could totally make that audio.

1552
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:07,720
Oh, I'm so tempted to make a Twitter audio now that I've said that out loud.

1553
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:12,840
Oh, I'm so tempted.

1554
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:22,040
I'm so tempted to literally, plop, plop, plop, and say get carried, carry me, carry me,

1555
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:27,000
until fireworks. Oh, I shouldn't have said that because I don't want to do it.

1556
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:36,840
No hands clapping is a talent for sure. So now do you believe that in the membership ASMR

1557
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:42,440
I can clap? Every time someone says I tingled when I do something, I tingle you, then yeah.

1558
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:48,920
Please carry me audio. Yeah, literally. Please make that Twitter audio. I just might.

1559
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:56,280
I just got what she meant by holding her jibblies. Yeah, my boobah. I need to hold them in place

1560
01:43:56,280 --> 01:44:01,720
because when I jump up and down, they jump with me. Surprise. We all are just one person.

1561
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:08,040
Yes, please do it. Do it. You want no boss? No boss. That's how you say it in Scotland.

1562
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:12,680
If you either say the plate way, which is a double donut to your year, or you say

1563
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:17,400
shake bag if you didn't, or you say date new boss.

1564
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:34,840
What if the plopping gives tingles, infinite tingles? No, I have to actually do something.

1565
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:39,000
You can't just be like, I tingled because like I moved across the room.

1566
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:41,160
No, it doesn't work like that.

1567
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:50,760
My stomach is making some cringey. You have a very particular skill set, yeah.

1568
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:53,240
I mean, I could do it right now if you want.

1569
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:02,760
So this is a sample of what's going to be happening in the members ASMR. Hold on, let me just,

1570
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:06,120
I'm not sure if I'm going to hear it if I don't know.

1571
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:13,240
Infinite tingle exploit. It's a video game. Oh, should I make a video game, but it's all

1572
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:20,840
about clapping? Okay, hold on, I need to do it. My headset, I was actually hearing what the heck is

1573
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:31,160
going on. I don't know if I'm jumping to the left though because I have to like pretty much

1574
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:42,200
the jump to the left. That one's on the house. Okay, I'm completely in the chair again.

1575
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:49,160
How high can I jump? Not very. I don't have much of a vertical leap.

1576
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:54,360
Let me put this back on.

1577
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:01,640
What the heck?

1578
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:05,880
I have a wet patch, what's it called?

1579
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:15,000
She doesn't know, maybe if I had to move her in a video game, one would be like inking,

1580
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:21,560
two would be clapping, three would be banshee screaming, and four would be

1581
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:31,880
tea something. The tick damage on this glass. Okay, there's that back down again.

1582
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:35,720
Sorry, add that, add that, go back on, it's quite cold.

1583
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:39,080
That's a great talent man, I can do it.

1584
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:51,800
I think we've just discovered a terrible oversight by myself. I don't think I can

1585
01:46:51,800 --> 01:47:00,600
redirect into a viewer member. Community, community? No, unity in shambles right now.

1586
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:07,480
Analytics, no not analytics. Redirect, is there anyone who can redirect online?

1587
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:16,360
There's no one at UMI Plus online either. That's it, VNU, I'm looking at you next.

1588
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:26,440
Oh wait, Mero, Mero might be coming online. We Mero, listening to this while studying,

1589
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:30,040
me studying hard, Tescare, small, grabbable.

1590
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:40,680
What did you call me, a grabbable cuttlefish? I don't think I've ever been called a grabbable

1591
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:51,720
cuttlefish, that's amazing. A grabbable cuttlefish. Okay, Mero's not coming online until a couple of

1592
01:47:52,120 --> 01:48:02,120
hours. Thank you so much for the five fabry mathy, fabry mathy. Enjoy your studying,

1593
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:08,120
sorry if I made it hard. Honestly, it's me, what's going to happen? The most vital thing I heard

1594
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:14,120
about someone with the large butt, look at the arsonat, look at the arsonat thing, you know she

1595
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:25,720
can shake, that's fucking mean. Oh my god, squeeze the cuttlefish, hold the cuttlefish,

1596
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:31,160
get mesmerized by the cuttlefish, get mained broken by the cuttlefish.

1597
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:44,520
Okay, now there better be someone online at VNU headquarters, I'm gonna scream,

1598
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:55,080
I'm going to subscribe to literally everyone right now, so it tells me who the heck is online.

1599
01:48:56,040 --> 01:49:04,360
Okay, I'm gonna close, I'm gonna refresh my page, damn girl, you're shooting it.

1600
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:17,320
Oh, there's not one VNU girl online right now, what's going on at VNU headquarters, please?

1601
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:25,480
I can't fucking handle it right now, so we're doing fucking that 4v maria that can never

1602
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:32,840
spell right, 4v, 4v maria. So you can literally hear all that click, I'm like desperately trying

1603
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:38,280
to find someone to redirect into because I don't want to like, it's not like I'm gonna waste,

1604
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:44,840
wait maybe Rem's doing that ASMR thing. Oh come on Rem, okay I'm gonna refresh the page again,

1605
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:50,920
surely there's someone we can redirect into, surely some of the other streamers online that

1606
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:57,560
doesn't hate us as an agency, oh for fuck's sake not one of them's online, this has to be a joke.

1607
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:14,040
VNU and 4v maria didn't have one person online, that's not possible.

1608
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:18,040
And of course mythos don't stream on YouTube because that would be too easy.

1609
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:37,640
No way, no fucking way, was it mythos, HQ really don't stream on you on this,

1610
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:47,000
not the body don't. Oh no they do, question mark, wait hold on,

1611
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:50,200
pause the phone, why do I not think, why do I think they stream on Twitch?

1612
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:56,040
Why did it, oh,

1613
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:03,080
VR, can't you see, oh sorry if you're gonna fucking call yourself sort of abstract,

1614
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:07,320
didn't you expect dumbasses like me to understand what on earth is going on,

1615
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:14,040
Rem, oh Rem comes online in nine minutes, okay I'm gonna ASMR the fuck out of you.

1616
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:21,320
Okay we're gonna redirect into Rem, redirect to a surrounding couple, she's streaming right now I

1617
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:29,000
think, literally, right, when I redirect into Rem, my little pumpkins please, don't be,

1618
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:40,360
don't, don't, I'm comfortable with you because I love you, I don't know what other VTubers

1619
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:45,720
comfortability levels are, like you know how we're complete djans out here, we're just saying,

1620
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:53,320
we're allowed to be, but just, wait Rem isn't too, I don't say that,

1621
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:58,120
no he's, Rem isn't, Rem isn't coming up, wait, what,

1622
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:07,400
whoever that wiefling says that Rem is coming online in nine minutes,

1623
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:11,560
no, no she's not, destroy that man,

1624
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:19,480
doesn't Merrow stream in seven minutes, no Merrow doesn't, like you mean Merrow,

1625
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:24,520
Merrow, it says Merrow's coming online at 12 p.m.

1626
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:32,200
No, is it, can I read, is there anyone,

1627
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:39,400
you could read strongly, she's live in seven, she is live in seven minutes on a member stream,

1628
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:45,400
can't, can't redirect to our members, is there not one person, there has to be one

1629
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:50,600
fucking streamer up right now, fucking, how desperate, wait, is it baked on,

1630
01:52:55,640 --> 01:52:59,240
mods, hang drawn for that wiefling, okay a bit dramatic, but no,

1631
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:10,040
nope she's online at nine a.m, oh freaking the screw, mods smack that man silly,

1632
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:15,400
you could read Maid Mint, is that not inappropriate of me to do that though,

1633
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:20,760
she's playing out her words,

1634
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:27,640
is that inappropriate to do, I don't know, I feel like it's inappropriate when it's like a big

1635
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:35,800
Vtuber, they're just like, do you know Pillowdeer, oh Pillowdeer's an ASMR, hold on a minute, Pillowdeer's

1636
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:42,120
an ASMRist, and she's playing Minecraft, why my darling, okay Pillowdeer's getting it because

1637
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:50,840
she does ASMR, um, she does it, oh for fuck's sake she's playing Minecraft with that fucking

1638
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:55,480
inappropriate server that I can't interact with, okay Mint Maid is, so Mint Maid is,

1639
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:59,960
congrats Mint Maid, I'm going to interrupt your stream with a host of randy wieflings,

1640
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:08,200
oh goodness gravy, I'm trying, okay please do be super respectful when I redirect into Mint Maid,

1641
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:17,160
and we got there in the end, we found someone,

1642
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:26,200
there we go, there she is, Outer Wales, I've actually never played Outer Wales,

1643
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:33,560
Fellas are good to play, Pillowdeer's super wholesome, yeah, and of course she's playing a

1644
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:40,920
Minecraft server that I can't interact with, so out of respect I can't interact with, so I might

1645
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:47,800
leave them to it, let them enjoy their thing, and so we'll redirect into Mint Maid, are you guys

1646
01:54:47,880 --> 01:55:00,200
gonna be okay? Okay as long as you guys are okay, Outer Wales is incredible, we should keep our

1647
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:07,720
tentacles for ourselves, yes please do behave, please don't be a goobie McGoober face,

1648
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:12,040
and because you're not comfortable with your bed, I don't know how other streamers are,

1649
01:55:12,760 --> 01:55:15,400
like you know how streamers like, don't backseat game, I'm like,

1650
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:21,240
literally just carry me through entire games, everyone's, different strokes for everyone's

1651
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:27,640
different pickle or something like that, okay, okay, right, rest well little brieflings, I am

1652
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:31,960
about to go make a cup of tea and get a cola, and then we'll do a membership brighten stream,

1653
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:37,880
and we'll see if you guys like it or not, and then after that I will be taking a break, and then

1654
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:46,200
I'll be back online for Yumi Plus, yumi yumi ye, yumi ye, yumi ye, sualalala, okay,

1655
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:59,800
bye bye, see you later alligator, see you on mungus, okay, bye bye
