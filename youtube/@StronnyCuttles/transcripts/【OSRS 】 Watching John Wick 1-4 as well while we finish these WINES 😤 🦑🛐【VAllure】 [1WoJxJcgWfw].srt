1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I haven't really messed up the settings for this, but I'm having a stroke.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I think that's the timestamp for the movie.

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Good morning, good evening, and good afternoon to all the Reflings from all across the world.

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I can hear myself. Stop talking a moment. Stop it.

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Closing all my tabs and...

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh right, I've closed everything off.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Right.

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
No.

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You may be sent yourself.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Strongly!

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Wait, my mic is delayed?

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Is my mic delayed?

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I think...

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I think my microphone is delayed as shit right now.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I just...

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
No?

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's a...

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hmm.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Could you raise the gain?

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Out of sync a bit?

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah, I see that too, what the fuck?

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Why, Mr. SMB, what's wrong with you today?

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You're on the correct sentence.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Of course, like, oh my god, Mercy couldn't have spoke true words when she said,

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
everything you do, you can change not a single thing from the last thing you did yesterday.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And the ting's having a stroke.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And all the good time.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I don't really want to reset it because it's got filters on it.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I've had fucksack!

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah, the model's looking a bit odd.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Leave my out of sync model alone, okay?

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The pilot...

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The pilot and the mecha aren't cooperating, okay?

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I can't believe it.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Testing.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What, what the fuck?

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The SMB's delayed by, like, a second.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't want to delete it because I don't know what filters are on it.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Wait, I do.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I've got de-noise and gain on it, and I'll need a read.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
How much gain?

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh, for fuck's sake.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Testing.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Why are you delayed?

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're stressing me out.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Why?

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm literally doing ventriloquism.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm watching it be so delayed in 4K.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What the heck?

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Can you forgive me?

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Can you forgive me if we...

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Because to be honest, I'm going to be pretty quiet whilst we're watching the movie anyway.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Hi, good morning. I'm so sorry.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Right, you're just going to have to forgive me.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I think it might be clashing with everything I've got with the movie set up.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's my only guess.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's my only guess.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm not smart enough for this.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let's see.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I mean, technically watch the movie.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah, if you guys can forgive me practicing my ventriloquistic sensibilities,

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
then I'm just going to pretend like I'm not a second out of sync for some reason,

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
because SMB's delayed for a second.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Today, we are playing Grinscape.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I have a sugar ton of wine to level up.

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't even know what world I'm in.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Probably not in a free world, so we can all hang out.

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
380 blaze it, please.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Here you go.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Switch world, please.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So me and the reflins can hang out.

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You're so cute as a vent.

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Can you raise the gain?

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Of end game or me?

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
End game.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Assume you mean end game forever.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hi.

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay, my reflins are here.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Or do you mean the microphone?

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Because the microphone was cool, huh?

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh, wait, hold on.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm a fucking idiot.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
How's that input?

84
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh, that's...

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Sorry, I'm bursting your eardrums.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
How's that for input?

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh my god, my gain was set to so low.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh, oh no.

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
My gain on the focus rate was...

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm so sorry.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm so sorry.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm so sorry.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Sorry.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's cut out.

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No, sorry.

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I just realized all I had to do was turn the knob.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You wouldn't believe how many problems in life

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
can be fixed by turning the knob.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh no, this can't be.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Right.

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Right, right, right, right, right, right.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Let's get a cheeky update on everything

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
that's happened since I last saw you

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
in Balatro yesterday, okay?

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hear ye, hear ye.

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
For those of you who are a member

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and wrote a membership script with me,

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
that audio is now live on Patreon.

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You can hear...

110
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So you can literally watch the script

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
being made in an hour,

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and then you can listen to how...

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It took an hour to write the damn thing,

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
took an hour to edit the damn thing,

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and it came out to less than 15 minutes.

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Arrest my case.

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It literally is redonkulous

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
how long it takes to make these kind of things.

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
But yes, that audio is now out on Patreon.

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So all four are technically five in my case

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
because I did have a demo reel to test my voice

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
because I was very confident.

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So I technically have five audios on Patreon as well.

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It looks like your model's behind the audio,

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
which means your model...

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
No, the model's not out of sync.

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The SMB's out of sync.

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This fucking thing is delayed.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I can see it not being in sync with me right now.

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's the SMB.

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's not the model.

132
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The model's in sync.

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And I don't know how to put a one-second delay

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
on the model input, so I can't do it.

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's not V2B Studio.

136
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's fine.

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We're gonna watch John Wick.

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's not gonna be that bad.

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
However, however, I just don't open my model's mouth at all.

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And then it's less frustrating for everyone watching.

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah, you didn't think about that, did you?

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
There we go.

143
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay, next update.

144
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This is fucking awful.

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Next update.

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
My 2000 celebration subscription and video is out,

147
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
where I clean your ears.

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The video almost got limited ads

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
because of my opening sentence.

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This is the silent mouth technique, honestly.

151
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So, the...

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Aventure?

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I can't believe Johnny got a mouth wipe shot, honestly.

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But it's the same when you get done for your teeth.

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
My 2000 celebration is out.

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The next audio, if you're interested in ASMR or audios,

157
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
is a collaboration with a wolf.

158
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's your hint, and that's all you're gonna get.

159
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Teeth clenching ASMR, let's go.

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Literally, yay, it doesn't look like I'm out of sync

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
because my lips aren't moving at all.

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Um...

163
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The viewer isn't being the eventual because of my accusations.

164
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh, no, no, I don't know why it's not...

165
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I don't know why it's delayed.

166
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Anyway, I just want to preference this stream by saying

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm gonna give up my all to watch all four John Wick's with you,

168
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
even though there's apparently a fifth one,

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
which defeats the purpose of trying to finish a series together.

170
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Um, I just want to say the likelihood of tomorrow's

171
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
runescape endurance stream being swapped for something else

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
is astronomically high, okay?

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm back to feeling sick, I'm back to feeling stressed,

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I am back to being constipated,

175
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and it happens right before the endurance stream.

176
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So don't think I'm not going on to you, body.

177
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I know exactly what you're doing.

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
My body is rejecting endurance streams,

179
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
but I'm saying no, okay?

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Aren't you supposed to practice mental fortitude or whatever?

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Well, mental fortitude, these wines in Edgeville,

182
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm gonna mental fortitude so hard all over these wines.

183
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Um...

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So I'm not really sure what's going on with my body.

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Um...

186
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But my dad is coming over very soon.

187
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So don't be shocked when you see streams are like

188
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
no more than four hours a day.

189
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Like, I'm having to break up cameo in two streams,

190
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
which is crazy, because I can do it in one.

191
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I can do it in one.

192
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And like, Viva Pignata's getting broken up into two streams,

193
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
like all this kind of stuff.

194
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I had to delay Shadow of Mordor.

195
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Um...

196
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Stress does wild things.

197
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Literally, why the fuck does my stress manifest

198
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
that it clogs me full of shit?

199
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Like, I'm sorry to be nasty with the details.

200
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But why does mine go...

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh...

202
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh...

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Right, we're a bit stressed, right?

204
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Mmm...

205
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Okay, enema, enema, give them an enema.

206
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Literally, like, why does mine have to go that way?

207
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Why can't I just be the, oh, I'm exhausted kind?

208
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Like, yeah, I'm a wee bit tired right now.

209
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I guess, yeah.

210
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And I'm not sleeping properly.

211
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Like, yeah, I guess.

212
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But, oh my God, don't be so selfish.

213
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Honestly, did you guys, like, man,

214
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
you were short as well about, uh,

215
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
not one in a VTuber agency?

216
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I will put the movie on in a second.

217
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Uh, A.C. picked a great time to read.

218
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh, please tell me you didn't, A.C.

219
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Snowberries, I'm so sorry.

220
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Hi, A.C. and Snowberry berries.

221
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Um...

222
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm so sorry if you caught the tail end of that conversation.

223
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Hopefully not.

224
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Well, I'm currently having to be a ventriloquist

225
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
because my, uh, microphone is broken.

226
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We're about to enjoy John Wick together,

227
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
so if you want to join in, you most certainly can.

228
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
There's a timestamp as well as you'll be able to see on screen

229
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
what we're doing, okay?

230
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Uh, I just need to make sure...

231
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
you guys can also hear...

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Snowberries? Snowberries?

233
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Snowberries?

234
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What? Would you still love A.C. if she was Southern?

235
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Well, how do y'all Snowberries?

236
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Oh, gee, sons, what are you talking about?

237
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What do you mean we can't get the hand-jerking off Booth?

238
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yeah, that's right. I saw that tweet, A.C.

239
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I saw what happened.

240
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh, my little old, my old, gee, sons,

241
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
you guys are such perverts.

242
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yee-haw!

243
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah, we just all love A.C. if she was...

244
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Oh, I'm just putting all the wings in.

245
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Southern A.C. can't hurt you, she's not real.

246
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Southern A.C.

247
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's right, old, gee, sons.

248
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The other management's a man.

249
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

250
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So, A.C. is not allowed to jerk off station,

251
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
but I'm allowed the ASMR booth,

252
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
where I just straight up R-word reflins, right?

253
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Something's not going on.

254
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Something's not right.

255
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm calling out injustice when I see it.

256
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Something's not...

257
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Something's not on.

258
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Right, I'm gonna hit play on the movie

259
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
because I've got a cup of tea.

260
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I love all our daughters regardless.

261
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Okay, understood.

262
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
We'll hire a Southern A.F. for a Gen 2.

263
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Okay.

264
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
We'd love A.C. no matter what.

265
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Alabama A.C.?

266
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You want Alabama A.C.?

267
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
We got Alabama at home.

268
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
In Canada, in particular...

269
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Well, she's not in Canada right now, she's on holiday,

270
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
but yeah, we got Canada at home.

271
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
We got Alabama at home.

272
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Her name's Emmy.

273
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Strongly paid-off management.

274
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Probably the physical contact aspect.

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yee-hee.

276
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Can we get a Mongolia?

277
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Wow, and we are not getting a throat singer

278
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
for Gen 2.

279
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Absolutely not.

280
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Could you imagine?

281
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I swear to God.

282
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Actually, you know how I've said all this stuff out loud?

283
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What do you think the odds are?

284
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
There'll be one little shitposting girl

285
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
that's gonna tickle me f-

286
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
that's gonna tickle me ivories

287
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and make me laugh by coming out with

288
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
doing Mongolian throat singing.

289
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What do you think the odds are of that?

290
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I would be...

291
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'd be very shocked.

292
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But I feel like there's one that's shitposting

293
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
enough to do that.

294
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You're telling me there's not one girl

295
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
shitposting enough to be like...

296
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

297
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's my impression.

298
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
10% chance.

299
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
AC just wants to do ASMR to another part of the body.

300
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh, yeah, you want pee-pee tingles?

301
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'd be glad to tell you because I'm boss.

302
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
For coming to visit me.

303
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh, gee, souls, I'm gonna tingle you myself.

304
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm gonna tingle you right here.

305
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That's right.

306
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Don't even need your ears for tingling.

307
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Okay, shall we start with John Wick?

308
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Right, are we ready?

309
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Is everyone got John Wick open?

310
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That's a lot to unpack.

311
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Please don't listen to my crazy rambles.

312
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Right, and before there's like eight slime girls

313
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
that apply to be in Gen 2,

314
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
but in their condition is I'm not gonna be

315
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
if I'm not slime.

316
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Get your snacks.

317
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Is it?

318
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I've got one hour, 41 minutes and 13 seconds.

319
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Everyone ready?

320
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Three, two, one, go!

321
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Fuck, I messed it up.

322
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm sorry, I was gonna do the fucking ghost thing,

323
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
but then I fucked it up.

324
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
There you go.

325
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's blinding me.

326
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Okay, so basically I'm gonna...

327
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
We're gonna enjoy the movie together.

328
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Can you guys?

329
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You guys can't hear the movie.

330
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
They're not be able to.

331
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm gonna be nervous.

332
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh my god, we're doing roller coaster,

333
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
a role play, Thunder Road.

334
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Wow, that was...

335
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You need to update that so badly.

336
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm not being funny.

337
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
When was that made?

338
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I feel like I could do better in any of these.

339
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Right.

340
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I've got scrawny the only snack I need.

341
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Thank you, Rolly Legend.

342
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And Brian.

343
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm so out of sync.

344
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Okay, you can't hear it good.

345
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Oh my god, it...

346
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh!

347
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
See, that's sometimes when you get your driver's license

348
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
at like 16 or something.

349
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Oh!

350
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I take it back.

351
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I take it back.

352
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Hold on, let me turn the game sound.

353
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Are we not?

354
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Is this the end of the movie?

355
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Hold on a minute.

356
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Am I on the wrong movie?

357
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Oh, they're kissing.

358
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
They're kissing.

359
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's been many a year.

360
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What the fuck?

361
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I don't remember this.

362
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Fuckin' Elements in a mansion!

363
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh my god, he's a 1%.

364
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Get him!

365
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No, I'm just kidding.

366
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That's not what 1% looks like.

367
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I assure you.

368
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Eww!

369
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I was the drip from the coffee cup.

370
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That wasn't correct.

371
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Oh, that's actually really sad.

372
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
What the fuck?

373
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
POV me.

374
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
We were nervous away for a year, Kirkin.

375
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Oh no!

376
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
She had a brain aneurysm!

377
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No!

378
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Fuck!

379
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
That shit will strike.

380
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Sorry, I might...

381
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Holy shit, this is why we can't watch up

382
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
before anyone requests up.

383
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
No, I will start crying.

384
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I don't want to cry.

385
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Hold on a minute.

386
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Oh my god.

387
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Bro, am I going to start crying?

388
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What the fuck?

389
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Why is this movie so sad?

390
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's supposed to be about guns and pew pew!

391
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What the fuck?

392
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm like literally tearing up.

393
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Do you mind video game movie?

394
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Holy crap.

395
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
No, for fuck's sake!

396
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
There's still short scenes.

397
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And don't worry, it gets worse.

398
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Stop.

399
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Am I allowed to cry?

400
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm like crying.

401
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But it's okay.

402
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'll smile in a minute when these scenes go over

403
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
and then we can talk about the pistols

404
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and stuff that they use,

405
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
because I like the guns.

406
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
They always use MPKs.

407
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't know, I don't know.

408
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I don't know.

409
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't know.

410
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't know.

411
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I don't know.

412
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I don't know.

413
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I don't know.

414
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I don't know.

415
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I don't know.

416
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I don't know.

417
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I don't know.

418
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I can't take the guns.

419
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
They always use MP5 Kifs and movies

420
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
for some reason.

421
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh,

422
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Who picked this fucking movie?

423
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's been like 10 seconds.

424
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh yeah, pys, it's the green Goblin!

425
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,500
Oh.

426
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,020
Oh, sorry.

427
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,600
Oh my god, I'm actually waping away my tears. I can't handle this shit.

428
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,360
Ha ha!

429
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Oh.

430
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,280
I can't drink my tea. Now my throat's closed up.

431
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,720
I don't know if you get it when you get teary, your throat closes up.

432
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,760
I can't freaking drink my tea.

433
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,680
No, wait, this is even sadder because didn't this happen to him in real life?

434
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,240
And he never remarried or dated anyone else?

435
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Ah, where the fuck did I pick this? I'm in shambles right now.

436
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,160
I'm snot coming over now.

437
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
Oh.

438
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,040
Oh.

439
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,840
I can't even handle this.

440
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,800
I'm like laughing but...

441
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,320
Oh, I don't remember this phone being so sad.

442
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,120
I just need to drink my tea before it gets cold.

443
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,240
Oh.

444
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Oh my god, what is it?

445
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,720
It better be a breather. It's good and not bad.

446
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,240
What breed is it? If I...

447
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,040
It better not be a pug.

448
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,080
Oh, no.

449
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,680
No!

450
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,480
Oh, wait, what?

451
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,480
What is that? I don't know. I don't know what kind of dog that is.

452
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,680
Oh.

453
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,400
You'll feel better once the killing starts, unironically, yes.

454
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,400
Okay, I'm gonna start telling you about the Makarov and then the invention of the M7-11.

455
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,400
And the utilities of the AK-47, why it's the most popular assault rifle crafted and created.

456
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Oh, hi, poppers.

457
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Oh, hi, sweet thing. Oh, it's so tiny.

458
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:20,280
Oh my god. Wait, the fact that she knew that he would need something to love on.

459
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,160
No, I can't fucking...

460
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,160
Daisy, no!

461
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,400
This is even worse than you could make it.

462
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,360
Not perfect. It's called...

463
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,080
Absolute shambles.

464
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,960
Who picked this?

465
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,280
Fucks sake, please tell me two isn't like this either. I can't even handle it.

466
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:57,080
Oh, we popper. No, the popper goes on the bed, you daffodil. Sorry, I don't know.

467
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,720
Yeah, let it on the bed right now. No!

468
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,760
Exactly, that's what I thought. Oh, it's so tiny and wee.

469
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,760
Oh.

470
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,480
Happily ever after fans and shambles at this movie.

471
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,160
Right, I'm gonna try and drink my tea without choking on it and he's stop crying.

472
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,680
Oh, it's like waking in a mop and stuff. Oh, he says, don't...

473
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,680
Daisy goes, don't rot in bed.

474
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Oh.

475
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:41,960
Well, okay, my tea's called anger-resuming natural emotions reinstating.

476
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,920
Oh, it's got a wee collar and everything.

477
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:03,800
Oh, he's not got our dog food yet. Yeah. Oh my god, this movie's so real though.

478
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:16,840
Oh, look at our ee. Look at our wee floppy ears around the bowl. Oh. Sweet.

479
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:24,920
Oh my god, what a smart puppy for a film crew, honestly.

480
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:32,920
She's like, I know my spot, I'm getting my treat, I'm gonna go right here. Oh, you're so smart.

481
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:43,000
Oh, transformers. I'm fucking with you.

482
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,880
Filling up that gas. She said, hey, mama, let me get you a number.

483
00:25:51,880 --> 00:26:06,840
They really said, put the most freaking... Obliette.

484
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:26,040
Sorry, but Russians are as they've shown us as a bad guy. It's either Chinese or Russian.

485
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:33,800
Wait, he got his willy chopped off in Game of Thrones.

486
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:47,800
See you on Greyjoy.

487
00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:01,800
Not for sale. She, ooh, the girl's she, the car's a she. My little puppy.

488
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:21,640
That guy has 83 in the 86. Close enough. Same number, honestly. They both start with an eight.

489
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:31,000
Wait, is the young Greyjoy actually a previous speaker or did they just know the lines?

490
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:37,720
You'll see the Italians in a second, don't worry. Oh, okay. Right, 86 cooking.

491
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,120
Wait, is the puppy in the car when he's going this fast? That thing's sweet,

492
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,960
ears are going to be flapping in the wind.

493
00:27:49,960 --> 00:28:00,920
No, look at the pup.

494
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:32,520
The truck's almost kissed.

495
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,920
He was using the driving as an emotional outlet for his emotions.

496
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:50,280
Hi Daisy. No, yes, finally. Dogs belong on the bed. They're so cute and they want to be a part

497
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:57,400
of the family and they want to be part of the pack. You're supposed to let dogs sleep on the bed for

498
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:04,360
you because if you don't, it means they're not a part of your pack and it hurts their feelings.

499
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,680
That's right, animals actually have feelings.

500
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,320
Hi Daisy, weezy. Oh, bleat.

501
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,200
Oh, fuck.

502
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:47,480
I see you.

503
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:54,480
Brrrr.

504
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:01,320
Brrrr.

505
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,320
Over this?

506
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:09,320
Over 69 mustang?

507
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:16,320
Holy shit.

508
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:23,320
No.

509
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,320
That's so sad.

510
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
What the fuck?

511
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,320
Did the fuck put this shit on?

512
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:39,320
No, don't touch her.

513
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:45,320
I hate it here.

514
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:52,320
Oh, what the fuck?

515
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,320
I can't even do that.

516
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:02,320
I can't even do that for them.

517
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,320
Those are such precious wee things.

518
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:12,320
No, for fuck's sake, don't call her next to her necklace.

519
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,320
I can't even handle this spell.

520
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:28,320
Oh my god.

521
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:39,320
Oh.

522
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:47,320
Bro.

523
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,320
I'm needing cuddles off your reflins after this one.

524
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,320
What the fuck?

525
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:20,320
I don't remember any of that, I just remember the guns.

526
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:27,320
And then in the second movie there's like a sauna scene with cool light in it.

527
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,320
That's all I remember.

528
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,320
I don't remember any of this sad shit.

529
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:42,320
I would have picked this if I knew how sad it was.

530
00:32:42,320 --> 00:33:11,320
I just make my wings like a good little RuneScape player.

531
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:20,320
Hey wait, my cat.

532
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,320
Did I read that right?

533
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,320
My cat's son stole the car?

534
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,320
We go?

535
00:33:53,320 --> 00:34:22,320
Okay, at least that guy in the suit seems to actually have some tact.

536
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:28,320
Oh my god, it is my cat.

537
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:51,320
Sad parts over our body, hope so.

538
00:34:51,320 --> 00:35:00,320
Take that drink.

539
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Shit, it's on the house.

540
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,320
Oh my god, it's that GT map and Grand Theft Auto IV.

541
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:15,320
And that little underbridge near the taxi depot.

542
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:32,320
Actually we should play GT4.

543
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,320
Oblivious.

544
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:43,320
Oblivious.

545
00:35:43,320 --> 00:36:00,320
Ow.

546
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,320
Holy shit.

547
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,320
He's not happy.

548
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,320
Oh my god, I have tears on my blanket.

549
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:21,320
I can feel them.

550
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,320
Congrats.

551
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:32,320
He's got other business to attend to.

552
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:38,320
Theon's been summoned by my cat.

553
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,320
He's gonna go around.

554
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:49,320
You know shit is real when it's just a singular O, honestly though.

555
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:54,320
Oh pardon.

556
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:00,320
Sit down son.

557
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,320
Is he about to get glassed?

558
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:22,320
No.

559
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:39,320
Oh.

560
00:37:39,320 --> 00:38:08,320
He's not here.

561
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,320
Per Theon, he always gets beaten up in his roles, honestly.

562
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,320
They're like, oh you're perfect for beating up.

563
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:29,320
And you're hired.

564
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:47,320
He's got a punchable face.

565
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:55,320
Shit.

566
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:01,320
Holy fuck.

567
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,320
Baba Yaga!

568
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:25,320
I forgot they called him the boogie man.

569
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:49,320
Phew.

570
00:39:49,320 --> 00:40:06,320
Oh my god.

571
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,320
A hag witch, eater of men.

572
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:20,320
Okay, Baba Yaga for Gen 2 confirmed.

573
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:33,320
And yes.

574
00:40:50,320 --> 00:41:19,320
Here a dead man walking.

575
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:41,320
Holy shit.

576
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,320
He does say Gigi literally.

577
00:41:44,320 --> 00:42:07,320
He said, oh fuck he's about to bake him.

578
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:34,320
Oh shit.

579
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:59,320
He tried it's ogre for his son.

580
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:06,320
I just got tattoos for this fortune.

581
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:24,320
Fortuna.

582
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:31,320
I don't know what his back tattoos said.

583
00:43:31,320 --> 00:44:00,320
Enough goes hard when he didn't say a word.

584
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:17,320
Oh.

585
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:34,320
What's happening?

586
00:44:34,320 --> 00:45:00,320
He's got home advantage.

587
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:27,320
There's the layout.

588
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:40,320
No his balls.

589
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,320
Actually yes his balls.

590
00:45:42,320 --> 00:46:03,320
Yes everything, they deserve it.

591
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:30,320
Oh my god that would be terrifying.

592
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:59,320
We don't want to hurt civilians.

593
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,320
One.

594
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:17,320
Don't get him involved, it's a messy clean up.

595
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:42,320
He's in on it?

596
00:47:42,320 --> 00:48:08,320
Police interaction to be honest.

597
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:34,320
It's like the idea of an underworld currency that the people don't know about.

598
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,320
Oh clean clean clean.

599
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:43,320
Sorry waste disposals in the background.

600
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,320
Okay okay waste disposal.

601
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,320
I was like 8k 47 time?

602
00:48:47,320 --> 00:49:03,320
No no cleaners cleaners.

603
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:18,320
They're just in gimp suits, it's fine it's fine.

604
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,320
They just like being in gimp suits.

605
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:42,320
What is harem?

606
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,320
Ah.

607
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:20,320
I swear that was literally me in the bag for real for real.

608
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,320
Your cat also talks Russian?

609
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:37,320
I know I have such a talented little cat honestly.

610
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,320
Thank you well.

611
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:47,320
I just say thank you in Russian, I don't know.

612
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:43,320
You know I'm somewhat of a refling myself stop, that's such a good motto for us.

613
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:53,320
Oh my god my eyes are all puffy from greeting.

614
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:57,320
Is that Marlon Manson?

615
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:02,320
A big nice.

616
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:06,320
The food fighters.

617
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,320
Oh right what can we identify?

618
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,320
What's going up first?

619
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,320
Can we identify any of the guns?

620
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,320
We have sniper rifle.

621
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,320
Oh I'm shit with snipers.

622
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:30,320
Fuck.

623
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:35,320
Bindalk Saints.

624
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:39,320
Is that drip for?

625
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:54,320
Oh it's that skinny building in New York.

626
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,320
At third mate it looks pretty badass.

627
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:13,320
Reflings you didn't tell me you looked so cool.

628
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:35,320
Oh no.

629
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:50,320
Wait a minute I'm getting a memory.

630
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:55,320
Lance?

631
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,320
Who's Lance?

632
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,320
The gentleman behind the desk?

633
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:11,320
The concierge?

634
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:37,320
Oh.

635
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,320
No I can't handle it.

636
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,320
I'm not going to cry.

637
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,320
I'll be big.

638
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,320
I'm a big girl okay.

639
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:51,320
I'm not going to cry.

640
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:58,320
You get back in their tear.

641
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:08,320
I feel like a form of fucking Rocky Horror picture show up in here.

642
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,320
What's going on?

643
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:48,320
What?

644
00:55:48,320 --> 00:56:14,320
What?

645
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:42,320
Jonathan.

646
00:56:42,320 --> 00:57:11,320
Two down to the bone after dog died.

647
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,320
Interesting choice of words Winston.

648
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:20,320
Hey Winnie.

649
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,320
Oh my god is Winnie the Pooh's name Winston the Pooh?

650
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:48,320
Haha.

651
00:57:48,320 --> 00:58:14,320
It's not business it's personal.

652
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:20,320
Ooh is that how we skirt the rules?

653
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:24,320
Don't kiss me you succubus.

654
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:32,320
You.

655
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,320
Oh he's so fucking humble.

656
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,320
I'm going to start green again stop it.

657
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:24,320
Hey.

658
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:28,320
That's me in the Google page.

659
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,320
I don't even know how Google dance and work ends.

660
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:41,320
I just know it's called Google dance.

661
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:48,320
Again bullet proofed up.

662
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,320
You met Keanu Reeves?

663
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,320
A promotion?

664
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:58,320
I see is literally DJing right now.

665
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:04,320
I knew she worked at a nightclub before fucking John Wick nightclub.

666
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,320
Oh shit wait.

667
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:13,320
Right stop memin something big's about to happen stop memin.

668
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,320
It's me look I got a part in the show.

669
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,320
That's not me that part isn't me.

670
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:26,320
I'm that tall I'm really in that tall I'm tiny.

671
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:33,320
See that can't be me because that model had 10 toenails my apologies.

672
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:43,320
Theon.

673
01:00:43,320 --> 01:01:04,320
Before she was AC she was the DJ at the continental.

674
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:17,320
She recognizes them.

675
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:44,320
Whoa.

676
01:01:44,320 --> 01:02:04,320
He is scared he's pretending.

677
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:33,320
I'm having a good time I cried my eyes out.

678
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:43,320
I like when they give a chance for someone who isn't involved in the business to get out.

679
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,320
I can't wait for the fifth movie.

680
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:56,320
I don't even know what three or four consists of I think I've seen two but I thought this scene was in two but I think I'm mistaken.

681
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:42,320
No.

682
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:47,320
Whoa.

683
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:54,320
Hell hath no fury like a man scorned like a husband scorned.

684
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:41,320
No no spoilers for the future movies please because I don't know.

685
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:56,320
Whoa.

686
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:18,320
Shit.

687
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:36,320
Stealth mission failed but we got close.

688
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:59,320
Fuck.

689
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:25,320
Fuck we missed.

690
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:43,320
Fucking AC is good at this holy shit.

691
01:06:43,320 --> 01:07:12,320
I suppose because of how loud clubs are there is a possibility you wouldn't hear the bullets.

692
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:23,320
Wow.

693
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:27,320
You know if you ignore all the death the club is banging.

694
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:56,320
They have no in the background AC and strongy DJ collab honestly I'd be so down.

695
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:06,320
Fuck.

696
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:17,320
No civilians remember no civilians.

697
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:25,320
I didn't know we're in Glasgow.

698
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:35,320
Go again go again.

699
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:42,320
I'm pretty sure you can get internal damage even with a bullet per vest on.

700
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:49,320
So if you guys are like oh get up John get up no like that shit is impactful as fuck.

701
01:08:49,320 --> 01:09:14,320
This club's still banging I'm glad they left the music on AC is really dedicated she said

702
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:26,320
I paid for my shift I don't care what happens.

703
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:38,320
No no no no no.

704
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:46,320
I would be so winded a kid you're not.

705
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:55,320
I would be me down and out not gonna lie.

706
01:09:55,320 --> 01:10:01,320
True DG let's nothing stop their set.

707
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:10,320
Oh.

708
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:15,320
You'll make you swallow them words and choke.

709
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:21,320
Just like I'll make you swallow them.

710
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,320
Oh we're so fucked up.

711
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:28,320
Do they have health kits at the continental?

712
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,320
You have a medic?

713
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:33,320
Medic please.

714
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:50,320
Thank you.

715
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:59,320
All the pain.

716
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:03,320
Oh that was a nasty gas.

717
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:16,320
That takes time to heal.

718
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,320
Oh the wee ice pack on his shoulders adorable.

719
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:38,320
I've never seen those.

720
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:46,320
Bourbon is alcohol that much of a pain suppressor?

721
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,320
This cannot be true.

722
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,320
Have you been stabbed?

723
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:57,320
I think I'd rather reach for a boot profan over a wee cheeky vodka.

724
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,320
A nasty gas.

725
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,320
Oh you want to see my nasty gas.

726
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,320
You're making it too easy.

727
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:07,320
If you're drinking off I guess if you get bit faced.

728
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:10,320
Oh.

729
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:15,320
No.

730
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:24,320
Let this poor man rest please give him 24 hours at least.

731
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:36,320
My boss dinner's night my boss please let me keep him.

732
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:47,320
Wait.

733
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:50,320
That was a warning.

734
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,320
Green Goblin's still friendly?

735
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:57,320
That was a warning.

736
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:16,320
Can I say something really bad?

737
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:33,320
I like how the only way that they can go hand in hand is when he's severely damaged.

738
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:51,320
She's only equal when he's 70% dead.

739
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:55,320
Reflins you can't say that.

740
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:58,320
I can't get a clear shot.

741
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:04,320
Fucking hell she like doing maneuvers on him and stuff.

742
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:10,320
I can't even imagine the pain.

743
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:35,320
Fuck you can't see the shot at all.

744
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:02,320
Oh he's going to finish the job.

745
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:14,320
Oh you made a mistake lady.

746
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:27,320
Leave my cat out of this.

747
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:44,320
Oh color me surprised.

748
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:56,320
You're just...

749
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:00,320
Oh.

750
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:05,320
No.

751
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:23,320
Why don't we convo?

752
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:26,320
Fuck I hope they managed to close up his body.

753
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:33,320
He just got the damn stitches in place.

754
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:36,320
Yeah the director did a great job.

755
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,320
I kind of keep coming back to the dead in the lobby.

756
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:42,320
I like his voice.

757
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,320
Can I get you some bourbon?

758
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:53,320
I can't say it though I don't know how to do it but...

759
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:57,320
Oh!

760
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:01,320
You shot a holy man.

761
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:08,320
Oh he's one of them.

762
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:21,320
He really put the holes in the holy man.

763
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:39,320
And you think he won't?

764
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:45,320
Wait what gun is that?

765
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:50,320
M16?

766
01:17:50,320 --> 01:18:01,320
It's not ACOG.

767
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:04,320
M4.

768
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:08,320
I was going to say M16 didn't quite look great.

769
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:17,320
I blew all the fuck.

770
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:22,320
He just helped the economy.

771
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,320
We love casting spells.

772
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,320
Shadow Wizard Money Gang.

773
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:33,320
We love burning money.

774
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,320
John is a refling.

775
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:37,320
He understands.

776
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:40,320
Blackrock headquarters.

777
01:18:40,320 --> 01:19:01,320
He understands.

778
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:19,320
There you go free mustache wax.

779
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:43,320
No.

780
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:51,320
No, no, no.

781
01:19:51,320 --> 01:20:16,320
Oh come on.

782
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:23,320
Why are we seeing Pina?

783
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,320
I'm helping.

784
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:45,320
I'm putting down cover fire.

785
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,320
I'd get over there too.

786
01:20:47,320 --> 01:21:01,320
I'm not going to pretend.

787
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:06,320
He goes for headshots.

788
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,320
Oh that was actually kind of smart.

789
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:14,320
I wouldn't have thought that myself.

790
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:21,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

791
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:29,320
I think we've been captured.

792
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:44,320
Come on, no, I don't like the look of this.

793
01:21:44,320 --> 01:22:12,320
We're hazy as well.

794
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:38,320
I don't know, I feel like people change.

795
01:22:38,320 --> 01:23:07,320
Just one comment Vigo, sorry to interrupt.

796
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:32,320
This is a battle rank.

797
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:57,320
With love.

798
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:24,320
We ain't doing the, this person died because it was in God's plan.

799
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:53,320
She was my wife.

800
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:53,320
She died because it was in God's plan.

801
01:25:54,320 --> 01:26:21,320
Oh, I'm 87 let's go.

802
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:40,320
Let's go John Wick for some level 87 and King.

803
01:26:40,320 --> 01:27:09,320
Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.

804
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:39,320
Oh shit.

805
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:45,320
He's a Baba Yaggle, right?

806
01:27:45,320 --> 01:28:02,320
Man's tied up and still manages to, he was so pleased with himself.

807
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:13,320
See the way he licked his finger there, like yeah, yeah, I did a good job there.

808
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:36,320
Whoa, I don't recognize the shotgun.

809
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:58,320
What's going on?

810
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:11,320
Uh-uh-uh.

811
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:44,320
Oh, he's him.

812
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:59,320
Is that one of the, I don't recognize it.

813
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:23,320
Oh, he's already in.

814
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:50,320
He doesn't like being kept up in the safe house.

815
01:30:50,320 --> 01:31:01,320
That actor is so good, I don't know how my cat is so good at acting.

816
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:14,320
Breh.

817
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:20,320
Can't believe I adopted a mafia cat, it all makes sense now.

818
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:49,320
It wasn't a hoarder cat's home.

819
01:31:50,320 --> 01:32:19,320
I don't know how my cat is so good at acting.

820
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:46,320
A car.

821
01:32:46,320 --> 01:33:07,320
It looks like the same as the other one.

822
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:08,320
It's another one!

823
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:09,320
Wait, am I being pepega?

824
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:14,320
Is that his car?

825
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:17,320
Am I being dumb and it's not the same car?

826
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:19,320
I can't tell the difference between cars.

827
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,320
No, it's the new one.

828
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:31,320
Okay, my apologies, my apologies.

829
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:39,320
An ally.

830
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:50,320
I thought he said something else there and I was like, oh, in this kind of movie?

831
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:56,320
Oh, please, give her a rest, woman.

832
01:33:56,320 --> 01:34:21,320
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.

833
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:36,320
Oh.

834
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:40,320
No!

835
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:57,320
No!

836
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:10,320
No.

837
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:15,320
Oh, come on!

838
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:32,320
Our only fucking friend?

839
01:35:32,320 --> 01:36:01,320
No!

840
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:28,320
Oh, no.

841
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:49,320
No, no.

842
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:10,320
It's...

843
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:37,320
Oh, you're fucking done at no.

844
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:52,320
You've been a bad kitty.

845
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:58,320
Yeah, you need to get out of the country fast because this man's on you.

846
01:37:58,320 --> 01:37:59,320
No!

847
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:04,320
Are we gonna walk in on his body?

848
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:23,320
No!

849
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:29,320
No, no, no.

850
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:34,320
I'm crying again. Why do I cry so much? It's supposed to be like an action game.

851
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:38,320
Why? Every friend and ally he makes.

852
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:56,320
Why can't this man have anything?

853
01:38:56,320 --> 01:39:17,320
You broke the rules.

854
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:24,320
If they were all in a diagonal, point at each other?

855
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:29,320
Anyone? Anyone? If they were all in a diagonal, point at each other?

856
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:33,320
Uh, no question mark.

857
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:46,320
I'm pretty sure you can get a double kill with one bullet.

858
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:49,320
With friends like these.

859
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:55,320
With friends like these. Come on, we've still got friends in the city.

860
01:39:55,320 --> 01:40:00,320
With friends like these. Come on.

861
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:15,320
We can do it, we can do it, we can do it, we can get there.

862
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:18,320
Aw.

863
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:27,320
The contrast from earlier film where it was like almost cathartic for him to be driving the car?

864
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:39,320
I mean, I guess it still is.

865
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:43,320
Hotel bro's coming clutch.

866
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:46,320
Oh, he's got his V.

867
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:58,320
He's paid his road tax. I saw that in the front of the car. It had the V paper. He's paid his road tax, lads.

868
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:08,320
Oh, he's not half him.

869
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:23,320
He said get off the road.

870
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:28,320
What is it called when a police car does a tactical takedown?

871
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:45,320
Like that, that, that, that, that.

872
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:50,320
A pit manoeuvre.

873
01:41:50,320 --> 01:42:02,320
Oh my God, his senses.

874
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:07,320
It's always an oozy with a Russian.

875
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:28,320
There'd be higher pitch.

876
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:40,320
Baba Yaga.

877
01:42:40,320 --> 01:43:00,320
He's fucking around, he knows he's dead.

878
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:26,320
Oh wait, we see the Matrix guy?

879
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:33,320
Ah.

880
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:37,320
Get the gun, get the gun. Pistole, pistole.

881
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:45,320
Oh, and there's Bill Perf of course there is.

882
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:53,320
Get out, out, out, out. Yes.

883
01:43:53,320 --> 01:44:03,320
Oh, it wasn't water.

884
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:12,320
Holy shit, the thunderclap of the car. I know it's raining.

885
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:23,320
No, come on, aim.

886
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:29,320
Manoeil Manoe?

887
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:42,320
Ah fuck that, I'm sorry, you're getting popped.

888
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:46,320
No.

889
01:44:46,320 --> 01:45:10,320
He's like had so many drinks in his system.

890
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:31,320
Now you want to talk, now you want to talk.

891
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:45,320
I'm fucking cheating.

892
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:55,320
No.

893
01:45:55,320 --> 01:46:15,320
Ah fuck, we just took organ damage though.

894
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:33,320
Please be the kidney, we have to.

895
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:39,320
Oh my God.

896
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:50,320
Is he gonna bleed out, did he get an artery on my cat?

897
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:59,320
Oh my God. He did.

898
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:22,320
Oh my God.

899
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:44,320
We did it.

900
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:56,320
He's not done? He did it, John, it's all good.

901
01:47:56,320 --> 01:48:10,320
Where are you? What more business does he have?

902
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:23,320
Fuck, he can't make it to the con and then offer heals, can he?

903
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:29,320
Okay, med supply, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, go, go, stuff the wind, stuff the wind.

904
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:33,320
Pack it in, pack it in.

905
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:43,320
Oh that's gonna stink.

906
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:55,320
Oh yeah, oh my God.

907
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:59,320
We don't mean to stress you out little buddies, it's okay.

908
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:17,320
We're just visiting, we needed the med supplies.

909
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:24,320
We're going again? No. Why is this movie so sad?

910
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:33,320
No. Oh I can't fucking handle this movie, he's going again.

911
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:43,320
Even though he was so heartbroken and that's the scene where she passed away under the fucking Brooklyn bridge.

912
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:48,320
No, he has enough love in his heart to keep going.

913
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:55,320
Okay, what the fuck, these are supposed to be PMP movies.

914
01:49:55,320 --> 01:50:03,320
Okay, what the fuck? Why would you read this?

915
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:09,320
Oh my God, he has enough love in his heart to keep going.

916
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:19,320
And he got a new popper.

917
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:25,320
I don't even know if I'm avoidable, what the fuck?

918
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:30,320
Okay.

919
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:34,320
Alright, hold on, if I've done this, if I've set it up right.

920
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:40,320
Is there any secret scenes in these movies? No, it's just credits.

921
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:47,320
Alright, I'll let the main credit roll. Oh my God, he has enough love in his heart to go again.

922
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:53,320
The badass music play and he looks away stronty and absolutely shambles.

923
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:59,320
Honestly.

924
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:08,320
Are you squirming me right now?

925
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:15,320
Sorry, I don't mean to make you greet at work, thank you fully legend for the tip.

926
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:20,320
Bruh, what the fuck, I don't remember any of the sad parts.

927
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:26,320
I just remember being like, haha, cool guns, okay, let's watch John Wick.

928
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:34,320
Don't I fucking regret it? Well, I don't regret it because it was a bloody good movie, but oh my God.

929
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:38,320
Right, if I've done this right.

930
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:43,320
Oh shit, okay. Does it see chapter 2 now?

931
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:51,320
Okay, hold on, wait, I need to pause so it's at the start. Does it see 2 on my thing if I've set this up right?

932
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:57,320
Which along with the t- yeah, so the movie, there shouldn't be a timestamp, but it doesn't see what the movie is?

933
01:51:57,320 --> 01:52:01,320
Or does it only see what the movie is when I click play again?

934
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:06,320
Oh, I cannae handle this.

935
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:16,320
We're also watching, does it say John Wick too? Because I'm smart John Wick.

936
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:21,320
One piss. Shit, I never did that in time, hold on.

937
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:25,320
Can I change it?

938
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:31,320
I'm, hold on, it should be text, text, text, text, text, text, where's text?

939
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:38,320
Show me the text foil, where's the text file? Sorry, there's like tons of files.

940
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:41,320
Okay, hold on.

941
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:47,320
We're watching John Wick too. Okay, yeah, sorry, I don't know why I thought that was going to happen.

942
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:53,320
Take a breather? Okay, I'll take a moment. I'm going to get, I think I'll get some food.

943
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:56,320
I'm going to make another cup of tea.

944
01:52:56,320 --> 01:53:03,320
That movie? Oh my gosh, that emotional turmoil in that movie.

945
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:09,320
What the heck? I don't, I think I'm such a cry baby which doesn't help at all.

946
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:16,320
Cause like, anything, like, I'm fucking crying just thinking about poor wee John.

947
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:20,320
But like, he had this happily ever after. I got yanked from him.

948
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:23,320
I got a puppy that gave him condolence. I got yanked from him.

949
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:26,320
And then he had enough love in his heart to get another puppy.

950
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:28,320
It is so sad.

951
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:31,320
Thank you Dim's doodam for the tip.

952
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:37,320
Ah, oh my god, it's a picture of a dog. I can see the tip has got a dog in it.

953
01:53:37,320 --> 01:53:41,320
Literally, I can't watch any cry baby films.

954
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:46,320
Literally, this is supposed to be an action film and I'm greeting my solo.

955
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:50,320
You cried the entire movie, honestly.

956
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:53,320
I can't handle any like, things that.

957
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:56,320
So before anyone says, oh, strongy, watch up.

958
01:53:56,320 --> 01:54:02,320
No, we are not watching up. I will be distraught the entire film, okay?

959
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:10,320
Ah, right, if I go get some food and a cup of tea, at least my throat won't be as closed up, okay?

960
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:13,320
Dogs are kind of a cheat code to the tear duct.

961
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:18,320
Actually, anything with like pets or like the happily ever after gets taken away.

962
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:21,320
I can't handle it. It's so sad.

963
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:25,320
But like, I'm okay. Like, I know I'm greeting my eyes out right now, but I'm okay.

964
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:27,320
I promise I'm okay.

965
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:31,320
Oh, it's just going fucking there.

966
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:33,320
Oh, right, I'm fine. I'm fine.

967
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:36,320
He got a new puppy. Life is good.

968
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:40,320
I'm sorry if I'm making anyone upset by my crying.

969
01:54:41,320 --> 01:54:46,320
The feature was crying makes everyone unanimously upset. Sorry.

970
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:50,320
Oh, right, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

971
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:52,320
It's an action movie.

972
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:55,320
Didn't we not appreciate all the guns? Oh my God.

973
01:54:55,320 --> 01:55:00,320
And did you see the way they reloaded and there wasn't too many bullets in the magazines

974
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:06,320
that didn't make any sense, like some other movies, like literally every other movie that has like infinite ammo, infinite clips.

975
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:09,320
So I do appreciate the detail that went into this film.

976
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:16,320
I have to admit, they casted Big Kenny Reeves perfectly.

977
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:19,320
I can't believe they casted Makat as the freaking mafia boss.

978
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:26,320
Like, sorry, but Makat Vigo, his backstory was that he came from a hoarder home.

979
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:30,320
It wrong. He came from the Russian mafia and he has to now hide out.

980
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:38,320
He's now a fugitive in my house as I feed him nibbles and give him those lucky lick pouches that I like.

981
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:42,320
Oh my God. But that's like such a good movie.

982
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:45,320
I forgot, I completely repressed.

983
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:52,320
The only part I remembered was the bath house scene because of the light and was like nice neon.

984
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:57,320
I literally had forgotten all the other aspects of the movie.

985
01:55:57,320 --> 01:56:02,320
So I don't, I am now unsure if I've actually seen John Wick 2.

986
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:05,320
I know for a fact I haven't seen 3 and 4. I didn't know they existed.

987
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:13,320
I thought I had seen 2, but I only remembered the bath house and that was in 1.

988
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:17,320
So I have a sneak in suspicion. I've actually not seen 2, 3 or 4.

989
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:22,320
So I have no idea what I'm going up against.

990
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:25,320
Who the new enemy is.

991
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:29,320
As for wines, yep, we're whining away.

992
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:32,320
I briefly got 95 cooking.

993
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:35,320
So I was at 94. Why are you guys ahead of me?

994
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:38,320
You've been playing offline without me, huh?

995
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:42,320
Bath house had some but literally I got hired, but then they, I went to a casting,

996
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:45,320
but then they denied me because I only have 9 toenails and they were like,

997
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:47,320
oh we can't cater to that.

998
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:50,320
We can't cater to that. That's disgusting.

999
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:52,320
I'm like, oh okay I guess.

1000
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:54,320
Like I tried, I tried.

1001
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:56,320
Sorry, I did some off-screen. No, you're not in trouble. I'm teasing.

1002
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:59,320
Anyone's welcome to level up off-screen.

1003
01:56:59,320 --> 01:57:03,320
1 was, number 1 was 2014. 2 was 2017.

1004
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:08,320
Oh, I don't, um, I, because of that bath scene in the colour scheme,

1005
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:12,320
I thought that was in 2, but it wasn't.

1006
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:16,320
So I actually don't know what's up ahead, I don't think.

1007
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:18,320
Nothin' yell, pedicure.

1008
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:20,320
Actually.

1009
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:23,320
Ah, astronomy's who says the continental confirmed.

1010
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:27,320
Literally, a new business, eh, we VEGO, no havin' it.

1011
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:30,320
Oh, right.

1012
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:33,320
And I thought it was your butt because it wouldn't fit on the camera.

1013
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:36,320
Hey, I like that, I like that.

1014
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:40,320
Um, right, I'm gonna take a very quick pause champ.

1015
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:43,320
I'm gonna get some food. I'm gonna make a cup of tea.

1016
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:46,320
I'm gonna go my little empty teacup here.

1017
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:48,320
Oh.

1018
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:50,320
But again, it'll be the same setup.

1019
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:52,320
There'll be a timestamp for anyone that comes in.

1020
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:56,320
I do apologise to any refunds that may have joined at any point and said hi,

1021
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,320
and I was too busy crying.

1022
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:04,320
I was too busy crying to be like, oh, I'm so glad you joined us.

1023
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:10,320
As for who's streaming today, I don't have a singular clue.

1024
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:14,320
I'm too busy, absolutely devastated over that movie.

1025
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:16,320
VEGO is cooler than a mafia boss.

1026
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:20,320
Literally, I'm about to commission my cat in a suit for the heck of it.

1027
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:25,320
But yes, I'm gonna get a snack, I'm gonna heat up some leftovers.

1028
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:31,320
I got a kebab, but I have some pasta left over.

1029
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:34,320
I got a chicken kebab and it has, like, lettuce and onion in it

1030
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:36,320
and a low lettuce and onion.

1031
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:37,320
Red onion.

1032
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:40,320
Hey, mome, can you mute RuneScape music?

1033
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:41,320
Oh shit, sorry.

1034
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:45,320
I actually left that in so it wasn't just, like, singular me talking.

1035
01:58:45,320 --> 01:58:47,320
Okay.

1036
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:49,320
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1037
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:52,320
Everything's muted and I've muted in-game audio capture,

1038
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:54,320
so it's literally just my voice.

1039
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:55,320
That's all you're getting in the stream.

1040
01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:56,320
Oh, that's weird.

1041
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:58,320
I mean, that's what an ASMR stream is, really.

1042
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:00,320
Just give it a few more steps.

1043
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:03,320
Sorry, I didn't think to do that.

1044
01:59:03,320 --> 01:59:05,320
Don't forget to blow your nose.

1045
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:10,320
No, I'm gonna suck up all the snot to keep the nutrients inside my body.

1046
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:12,320
I need every bit of hydration I've got

1047
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:15,320
because I have no idea what I'm up against with these next movies.

1048
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:22,320
And I swear to God, if that fucker that the Weeper Popper perishes,

1049
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:27,320
I'm gonna be, I'm not even gonna be able to eat for the rest of the day

1050
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:29,320
out of distress of this movie.

1051
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:30,320
I swear.

1052
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:31,320
Right.

1053
01:59:31,320 --> 01:59:34,320
Astroni can get 92 today.

1054
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:35,320
She'll be halfway there.

1055
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:37,320
Wow, please don't say that thing out loud.

1056
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:39,320
I thought this was so much faster.

1057
01:59:39,320 --> 01:59:40,320
I'm ready to swap to Fletchen.

1058
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:43,320
We could literally do Fletchen in four hours.

1059
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:47,320
These, these wines are taking their sweet time.

1060
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:48,320
Honestly.

1061
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:51,320
Astroni, I thought the point of movie streams was to save your voice.

1062
01:59:51,320 --> 01:59:53,320
No, you need to narrate through them.

1063
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:56,320
No, I'm not gonna be dead silent watching it.

1064
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:57,320
Like, I'm gonna be like,

1065
01:59:57,320 --> 01:59:59,320
Why are this is cool?

1066
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:01,320
Um, type thing.

1067
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:03,320
I don't know if it was like a movie watch along

1068
02:00:03,320 --> 02:00:04,320
and you don't say nothing.

1069
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:07,320
I feel like that's like taking the,

1070
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:09,320
Yes.

1071
02:00:09,320 --> 02:00:11,320
Um, clutch out cooking.

1072
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:14,320
You already came this far.

1073
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:16,320
I asked Gimli and Vigo to help you,

1074
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:18,320
but I think you need some head pads, honestly.

1075
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:20,320
I wonder if Gimli's being me.

1076
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:21,320
I don't at all.

1077
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:22,320
I have no idea.

1078
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:24,320
I like messed up my fingers so badly.

1079
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:27,320
Uh, recording my Patreon audio.

1080
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:29,320
I don't know if any of you are on my Patreon,

1081
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:32,320
but I use my finger to do it

1082
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:34,320
and I've messed up so badly.

1083
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:37,320
I've got a big nasty scab on it right now

1084
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:39,320
because I, I use my teeth.

1085
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:43,320
I use my teeth so, my wee fingies for.

1086
02:00:43,320 --> 02:00:45,320
Um, the audio was good.

1087
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:46,320
Like, thank you.

1088
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:49,320
I was, I was jamming that thing down,

1089
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:51,320
but to be honest with you.

1090
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:53,320
But the problem is I have very sharp teeth.

1091
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:57,320
Like, unironically,

1092
02:00:57,320 --> 02:00:59,320
sharp teeth.

1093
02:00:59,320 --> 02:01:00,320
Oh, sorry.

1094
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:01,320
I need to vent your orgasm.

1095
02:01:01,320 --> 02:01:04,320
I forgot my microphone isn't synced for some reason,

1096
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:07,320
so I'm doing vent your orgasm right now.

1097
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:09,320
How are you able to hurt yourself so much?

1098
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:10,320
Is that a kind of challenge?

1099
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:11,320
It just, it just happens.

1100
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:13,320
Literally, kind of,

1101
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:14,320
Shawnee's a biter.

1102
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:16,320
You want to find out?

1103
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:18,320
Sharp teeth, Shawnee, honestly.

1104
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:19,320
I'm a wee cuttlefish.

1105
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:22,320
If you've ever seen a cuttlefish's mouth before,

1106
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:24,320
or like a cephalopod's mouth,

1107
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:26,320
my teeth make sense.

1108
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:29,320
I, I just, I'd say finger me,

1109
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:31,320
but I don't need that scab there.

1110
02:01:31,320 --> 02:01:33,320
Honestly, you'd probably take the scab off

1111
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:35,320
from how hard you're puckering.

1112
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:37,320
I'm willing to lose the tentacle.

1113
02:01:37,320 --> 02:01:40,320
I mean, you need sharp teeth to dig your fangs into humans

1114
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:42,320
while we're in the water.

1115
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:43,320
The cuttlefish attack?

1116
02:01:43,320 --> 02:01:45,320
I don't think cuttlefish attack, really.

1117
02:01:45,320 --> 02:01:48,320
I think, I think cause they're so deep seed,

1118
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:51,320
it's really hard to even come across one naturally.

1119
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:54,320
Remember that time that video went viral?

1120
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:57,320
Cause someone who was visiting Australia

1121
02:01:57,320 --> 02:01:59,320
found a blue-ringed octopus

1122
02:01:59,320 --> 02:02:01,320
and was like touching it and playing with it.

1123
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:02,320
Cause they were like,

1124
02:02:02,320 --> 02:02:04,320
oh, what a bright and colorful octopus.

1125
02:02:04,320 --> 02:02:07,320
Not knowing it's like literally 100% kill rate

1126
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:09,320
if it wants to end you.

1127
02:02:09,320 --> 02:02:11,320
I remember that going viral

1128
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:13,320
and everyone was mortified.

1129
02:02:13,320 --> 02:02:16,320
Just as a rule with human,

1130
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:18,320
with human, with nature,

1131
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:21,320
the brighter the more of a warning it is

1132
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:23,320
to leave me alone.

1133
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:26,320
You ever wondered why chickens are so bland in color?

1134
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:29,320
Because they can hardly do a thing to you.

1135
02:02:29,320 --> 02:02:31,320
You want to know why tiger stripes

1136
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:33,320
are such a warning sign?

1137
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:35,320
Jesus.

1138
02:02:35,320 --> 02:02:37,320
How cute parishes did he live?

1139
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:39,320
I can't remember if it was a chick

1140
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:41,320
and it was a tourist

1141
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:43,320
and she recorded a video of her playing with it

1142
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:45,320
in the water

1143
02:02:45,320 --> 02:02:47,320
and it was straight up a blue-ringed octopus

1144
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:49,320
and it never hurt her or anything

1145
02:02:49,320 --> 02:02:51,320
but if it wanted to,

1146
02:02:51,320 --> 02:02:53,320
so I'm going to throw up from crying so much.

1147
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:55,320
I've not even had any liquid

1148
02:02:55,320 --> 02:02:57,320
so that burp doesn't, that burp's literally

1149
02:02:57,320 --> 02:02:59,320
just straight up I'm going to throw up

1150
02:02:59,320 --> 02:03:01,320
so upset watching John Wick.

1151
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:05,320
With nature, if you don't know what it is

1152
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:07,320
leave it alone, pretty much.

1153
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:09,320
A ten out of ten?

1154
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:11,320
I didn't even eat or anything for that.

1155
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:15,320
Right, I'm going to go get some food

1156
02:03:15,320 --> 02:03:17,320
before we go again.

1157
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:19,320
I'm going to get a cup of tea so I'll be four minutes.

1158
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:21,320
I think, I don't really need to think

1159
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:23,320
because I completely forgot to hydrate

1160
02:03:23,320 --> 02:03:25,320
and I'm dehydrating via my eyeballs right now.

1161
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:27,320
I'm so...

1162
02:03:27,320 --> 02:03:29,320
I will hydrate when we get back.

1163
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:31,320
Please, I'm going to say the S-word.

1164
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:33,320
No you're not.

1165
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:35,320
No you're not.

1166
02:03:35,320 --> 02:03:37,320
You want to know why cairns die their hair pink?

1167
02:03:37,320 --> 02:03:39,320
It's a warning so stop!

1168
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:41,320
You can't say that stuff out loud

1169
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:43,320
but why is it so true though?

1170
02:03:43,320 --> 02:03:45,320
Wait, hold on a minute.

1171
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:47,320
Are you allowed to say it out loud

1172
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:49,320
if it's the truth?

1173
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:51,320
Hmm?

1174
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:53,320
Now I don't mean to be a weirdo

1175
02:03:53,320 --> 02:03:55,320
but I'm allowed to say it out loud

1176
02:03:55,320 --> 02:03:57,320
if it's the truth question mark.

1177
02:03:57,320 --> 02:03:59,320
Yes? No?

1178
02:03:59,320 --> 02:04:01,320
I've got yes and a no.

1179
02:04:01,320 --> 02:04:03,320
Hmm.

1180
02:04:03,320 --> 02:04:05,320
Hmm.

1181
02:04:05,320 --> 02:04:07,320
Sus, sus, I don't know.

1182
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:09,320
No, there's some truths that you can't speak.

1183
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:11,320
Okay.

1184
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:13,320
Then we will do the...

1185
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:15,320
we will practice the non-speaking.

1186
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:17,320
How about that?

1187
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:19,320
Always speak your truth even if the world ain't right.

1188
02:04:19,320 --> 02:04:21,320
And they hated Strone, for she spoke the truth.

1189
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:23,320
I did that meme real quick.

1190
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:27,320
Honestly.

1191
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:29,320
I don't know if I should say it

1192
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:31,320
but we're already here.

1193
02:04:31,320 --> 02:04:33,320
I remember watching the YouTube channel

1194
02:04:33,320 --> 02:04:35,320
a couple of years back

1195
02:04:35,320 --> 02:04:37,320
and it was like freak out videos

1196
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:39,320
of people with multi-coloured hair.

1197
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:41,320
And the channel got taken down for hate

1198
02:04:41,320 --> 02:04:43,320
but it was just compilations

1199
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:45,320
of what people had produced.

1200
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:47,320
And someone was like in an atrium

1201
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:49,320
swinging their arms back and forth

1202
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:51,320
and it looks like they were about to fly away

1203
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:53,320
but she was like screaming back and forth

1204
02:04:53,320 --> 02:04:55,320
with her arms. I just remember that.

1205
02:04:55,320 --> 02:04:57,320
Don't censor yourself, my little seaweed assassin!

1206
02:04:57,320 --> 02:04:59,320
Oh my god!

1207
02:04:59,320 --> 02:05:01,320
Assassin!

1208
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:03,320
That would be my name if I was a wee assassin.

1209
02:05:03,320 --> 02:05:05,320
I'd be no... call me C.

1210
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:07,320
Seaweed.

1211
02:05:07,320 --> 02:05:09,320
Why do they call you Seaweed? Oh, weed

1212
02:05:09,320 --> 02:05:11,320
because I'm a bit shite, to be honest.

1213
02:05:11,320 --> 02:05:13,320
I'm not the best. And then C because

1214
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:15,320
well, the enemy kind of sees me

1215
02:05:15,320 --> 02:05:17,320
because I'm not very good at stealth as well.

1216
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:19,320
Yeah, call me Seaweed, the assassin.

1217
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:23,320
The truth is

1218
02:05:23,320 --> 02:05:25,320
Black Rock can't stop us now.

1219
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:27,320
No, we're learning.

1220
02:05:27,320 --> 02:05:29,320
We're getting the information.

1221
02:05:29,320 --> 02:05:31,320
A danger to us even.

1222
02:05:31,320 --> 02:05:33,320
I was snotting the back of my nose.

1223
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:35,320
You want to hear it?

1224
02:05:35,320 --> 02:05:37,320
Ew.

1225
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:39,320
Open your mouth. That's disgusting.

1226
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:41,320
I'm sorry. I just filtered one person

1227
02:05:41,320 --> 02:05:43,320
by doing that. I know that for a fact.

1228
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:45,320
Okay.

1229
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:47,320
I'm going to go make a cup of tea

1230
02:05:47,320 --> 02:05:49,320
and get some food. I highly

1231
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:51,320
give it the hot toe.

1232
02:05:51,320 --> 02:05:53,320
Oh my god!

1233
02:05:53,320 --> 02:05:55,320
Sick GF

1234
02:05:55,320 --> 02:05:57,320
gives you a...

1235
02:05:57,320 --> 02:05:59,320
Instead of doing like her spit, she goes

1236
02:05:59,320 --> 02:06:01,320
like that

1237
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:03,320
and then

1238
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:05,320
and it's all snot.

1239
02:06:05,320 --> 02:06:07,320
That's disgusting. See, this is why

1240
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:09,320
you can't let me come up with the ideas

1241
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:11,320
and execute them because I end up

1242
02:06:11,320 --> 02:06:13,320
being such disgusting things.

1243
02:06:13,320 --> 02:06:15,320
Literally, I come out with stuff that no one

1244
02:06:15,320 --> 02:06:17,320
would ever think.

1245
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:19,320
I legit gagged. I'm so sorry.

1246
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:21,320
Disgustingly hot.

1247
02:06:21,320 --> 02:06:23,320
I'm so sorry. This is why you can't let

1248
02:06:23,320 --> 02:06:25,320
me like execute things I want

1249
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:27,320
to do.

1250
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:29,320
Try not to be disgusting challenge coming

1251
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:31,320

1252
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:33,320
Try and come up with one normal ASMR idea

1253
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:35,320
challenge. Literally, my first opening

1254
02:06:35,320 --> 02:06:37,320
line on my most recent ASMR was

1255
02:06:37,320 --> 02:06:39,320
the STD clinics down there.

1256
02:06:39,320 --> 02:06:41,320
Right, okay.

1257
02:06:41,320 --> 02:06:43,320
Be normal for five seconds challenge,

1258
02:06:43,320 --> 02:06:45,320
Ronnie. Let's go.

1259
02:06:45,320 --> 02:06:47,320
Right, I will be a moment.

1260
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:49,320
I'll just give me a second to tingle.

1261
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:51,320
I highly recommend everyone, please get

1262
02:06:51,320 --> 02:06:53,320
up, please get a drink, please tingle

1263
02:06:53,320 --> 02:06:55,320
or tingle, tingle

1264
02:06:55,320 --> 02:06:57,320
or please

1265
02:06:57,320 --> 02:06:59,320
at least stretch your legs so

1266
02:06:59,320 --> 02:07:01,320
you don't become absolutely clogged

1267
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:03,320
like me. I think I'm already baking

1268
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:05,320
a two day loaf of bread at the moment

1269
02:07:05,320 --> 02:07:07,320
and it's not looking good.

1270
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:09,320
I'm going to have to start

1271
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:11,320
sending

1272
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:13,320
reeflings up there because something's not going

1273
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:15,320
on. Where's Kaka and on when you need

1274
02:07:15,320 --> 02:07:17,320
him? He's gone far

1275
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:19,320
toilet bowl and on is gone

1276
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:21,320
when you needed him most.

1277
02:07:23,320 --> 02:07:25,320
Yeah, that first line maybe tickle.

1278
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:27,320
Is this the movie marathon stream?

1279
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:29,320
Yes, so we're about to do

1280
02:07:29,320 --> 02:07:31,320
chapter two.

1281
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:33,320
We're going to start it after I go get a wee break

1282
02:07:33,320 --> 02:07:35,320
by a break.

1283
02:07:35,320 --> 02:07:37,320
I mean literally just get food to nourish

1284
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:39,320
my body because I didn't eat

1285
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:41,320
before stream because I don't eat before

1286
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:43,320
stream because I wake up and then I stream

1287
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:45,320
and then I eat.

1288
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:47,320
So I'll be literally a minute

1289
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:49,320
and by a minute I mean four minutes

1290
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:51,320
because the kettle takes four minutes to fricking boil. I don't know why it takes so long.

1291
02:07:51,320 --> 02:07:53,320
I feel like my British kettle was way better

1292
02:07:53,320 --> 02:07:55,320
but my Aussie kettle

1293
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:57,320
hooked to it.

1294
02:08:05,320 --> 02:08:07,320

02:35:54,040 --> 02:35:59,600
Against the rule oh next you're gonna ask him to fucking harvest the tomatoes in the back garden and shove them in jars next

1471
02:36:00,600 --> 02:36:02,600

No, what the fuck is that?

1477
02:37:01,160 --> 02:37:05,160
It's a summon a sigil

1478
02:37:11,360 --> 02:37:13,360
Lore

1479
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:17,100

I don't see saying that to him brother back off him

1487
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:19,760
I

1488
02:38:25,240 --> 02:38:27,640
Did we just make enemies by rejecting

1489
02:38:36,240 --> 02:38:39,640
Did we just make enemies with the whole of Italy is

1490
02:38:44,400 --> 02:38:46,400
The Vatican mad at us

1491
02:38:47,760 --> 02:38:49,760
I

1492
02:38:49,760 --> 02:38:56,760
Ehh?

1493
02:38:56,760 --> 02:39:01,760
Ehh?

1494
02:39:01,760 --> 02:39:05,760

1495
02:39:05,760 --> 02:39:09,760

1496
02:39:09,760 --> 02:39:14,760

1497
02:39:14,760 --> 02:39:20,760
Ehh?

1498
02:39:20,760 --> 02:39:24,760
Oh there's an enemy lady, did you catch that?

1499
02:39:24,760 --> 02:39:27,760
Looks like an enemy lady back there.

1500
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:33,760
Normally they shy away from showing any violence against ladies in movies.

1501
02:39:33,760 --> 02:39:38,760
But that looked like a lady enemy in the back.

1502
02:39:38,760 --> 02:39:45,760
Ehh?

1503
02:39:45,760 --> 02:39:50,760
No, are you joking?

1504
02:39:50,760 --> 02:39:55,760
A fucking grenade launcher?

1505
02:39:55,760 --> 02:39:59,760
You have to be kidding me.

1506
02:39:59,760 --> 02:40:03,760
Oh my god, please tell me the dog lives.

1507
02:40:03,760 --> 02:40:18,760
Are you serious?

1508
02:40:18,760 --> 02:40:23,760
Please tell me the dog's just chilling in the kennel in the back garden.

1509
02:40:23,760 --> 02:40:36,760
Oh thanks.

1510
02:40:36,760 --> 02:40:40,760
Oh thank god!

1511
02:40:40,760 --> 02:40:42,760
Didn't he do that to me again?

1512
02:40:42,760 --> 02:40:48,760
John Wick development team and writers and all that.

1513
02:40:48,760 --> 02:40:53,760
The thing just chilling- oh no!

1514
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:59,760
The necklace and everything is gone!

1515
02:40:59,760 --> 02:41:10,760
This man can't have shit!

1516
02:41:10,760 --> 02:41:14,760
Oh my god, at least he's got his pupper!

1517
02:41:14,760 --> 02:41:17,760
Holy fuck, he's becoming a monk!

1518
02:41:17,760 --> 02:41:20,760
He's letting go of everything he loves, fuck.

1519
02:41:20,760 --> 02:41:23,760
I'm trying to give it a positive twist so I don't cry.

1520
02:41:23,760 --> 02:41:25,760
He just wants to practice being a monk, okay?

1521
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:27,760
And he's getting rid of everything he loves,

1522
02:41:27,760 --> 02:41:31,760
because that's the monk way or something like that, I can't remember.

1523
02:41:31,760 --> 02:41:47,760
Tell me?

1524
02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:53,760
I can't answer him.

1525
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:59,760
Oh my god!

1526
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:05,760
He knows he's working.

1527
02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:10,760
Oh look at the dog!

1528
02:42:10,760 --> 02:42:12,760
Okay, I finished my thingy.

1529
02:42:12,760 --> 02:42:13,760
Jimmy's a goat, literally.

1530
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:22,760
Jimmy's like, alright, alright, alright.

1531
02:42:22,760 --> 02:42:27,760
Oh we went to the continent, oh!

1532
02:42:27,760 --> 02:42:30,760
Oh my god, that dog is constantly looking for his cue.

1533
02:42:30,760 --> 02:42:31,760
He's so cute!

1534
02:42:31,760 --> 02:42:38,760
Look at it looking at his hand for a treaty when he does the right cue.

1535
02:42:38,760 --> 02:42:41,760
Don't say no pets, I'll cry.

1536
02:42:41,760 --> 02:42:55,760
Don't say no pets, I'll actually greet.

1537
02:42:55,760 --> 02:42:58,760
Now the dog can come into the conversation.

1538
02:42:58,760 --> 02:43:05,760
It needs to know too why it's who's just got blown to smithereens legs.

1539
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:11,760
Okay, what's this?

1540
02:43:11,760 --> 02:43:17,760
The cement didn't even have time to dry before people started picking fight skin, literally!

1541
02:43:17,760 --> 02:43:32,760
Okay, what's going on here?

1542
02:43:32,760 --> 02:43:35,760
Good afternoon, hotel owner, Mr. Winston.

1543
02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:37,760
Big Winnie-Billy.

1544
02:43:37,760 --> 02:43:41,760
Winston!

1545
02:43:41,760 --> 02:43:44,760
I'm having my tea, please remember to hydrate, Riflin.

1546
02:43:44,760 --> 02:43:47,760
If you cried like me as well during the scene a little.

1547
02:43:47,760 --> 02:43:49,760
I didn't cry, I may have cried a little.

1548
02:43:49,760 --> 02:43:51,760
But I didn't cry though, because I'm a big girl.

1549
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:21,760
Dad's giving us some smack talk.

1550
02:44:21,760 --> 02:44:23,760
Sorry dad, we messed up.

1551
02:44:44,760 --> 02:45:13,760
But he was a different person back then, he's not the same big Johnny boy, he's different.

1552
02:45:13,760 --> 02:45:25,760
I'm a big girl, you said later me or Asa.

1553
02:45:25,760 --> 02:45:32,760
Okay, daddy's telling us what's up.

1554
02:45:32,760 --> 02:45:37,760
Okay, our options have been laid out before us.

1555
02:45:37,760 --> 02:45:44,760
What a smart pupper, honestly.

1556
02:45:44,760 --> 02:45:50,760
Can you make an exception?

1557
02:45:50,760 --> 02:45:53,760
Thank you! Yes, yes, yes, please!

1558
02:45:53,760 --> 02:46:03,760
I trust him in your hands wholeheartedly.

1559
02:46:03,760 --> 02:46:07,760
Aw, I trust him with the wee pupper.

1560
02:46:07,760 --> 02:46:10,760
I'll be back soon, don't worry.

1561
02:46:10,760 --> 02:46:24,760
I need to go on a badass mission against the Italians.

1562
02:46:24,760 --> 02:46:28,760
That's right, I'm just going to say random Italian phrases I picked up from Assassin's Creed.

1563
02:46:28,760 --> 02:46:30,760
What are you going to do about it?

1564
02:46:30,760 --> 02:46:33,760
Oh, it's the enemy lady.

1565
02:46:33,760 --> 02:46:36,760
Don't think, oh my god, yeah, yeah, you're feeling those pecs.

1566
02:46:36,760 --> 02:46:39,760
That's right, you like my pecs, don't you? Yes.

1567
02:46:39,760 --> 02:46:44,760
Actually, your hair's short, this might indicate a different kind of interest.

1568
02:46:44,760 --> 02:46:47,760
Hey, what team do you bat for? What's going on here?

1569
02:46:47,760 --> 02:46:50,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, a little sheebie move right there, what the heck?

1570
02:46:50,760 --> 02:46:52,760
That was my back door. Back off! Back off!

1571
02:46:52,760 --> 02:46:54,760
You foul beast.

1572
02:46:54,760 --> 02:46:56,760
I have a wife, you know.

1573
02:46:56,760 --> 02:47:11,760
She's in either, but I'm going to her very soon.

1574
02:47:11,760 --> 02:47:20,760
Fucking miscoosie, that was my arsehole chick.

1575
02:47:20,760 --> 02:47:35,760
Accidental prostate exam whilst you're getting patted down for guns, like, or eight of them.

1576
02:47:35,760 --> 02:47:46,760
And yet you did.

1577
02:47:47,760 --> 02:47:59,760
Yeah, probably.

1578
02:47:59,760 --> 02:48:11,760
With a fucking pencil.

1579
02:48:11,760 --> 02:48:15,760
Ooh.

1580
02:48:15,760 --> 02:48:35,760
I should dance, huh?

1581
02:48:35,760 --> 02:48:48,760
Who is it?

1582
02:48:48,760 --> 02:48:57,760
He wants in.

1583
02:48:57,760 --> 02:49:03,760
Never for the Italian.

1584
02:49:03,760 --> 02:49:32,760
Oh, well, I mean, isn't there a reason that the father thought?

1585
02:49:33,760 --> 02:49:48,760
Oh, she in Roma? I'm getting flashbacks to Assassin's Creed.

1586
02:49:49,760 --> 02:49:58,760
To say ghost in French, you say Lufantum, repeat.

1587
02:49:58,760 --> 02:50:02,760
I'll correct, say a Borgia, a big chisory Borgia going on here.

1588
02:50:02,760 --> 02:50:12,760
Oh, she's in Rome. I love my sister, but I can't kill her.

1589
02:50:12,760 --> 02:50:17,760
Everyone's in their own world.

1590
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:20,760
Everyone's doing their own thing, got their own problems, that was a good shot.

1591
02:50:20,760 --> 02:50:28,760
I like that train shot, or subway cart shot.

1592
02:50:28,760 --> 02:50:57,760
Mm-hmm.

1593
02:50:57,760 --> 02:51:06,760
Man, he really likes his Balenciaga, like, he's like, no, so I can't be the boogeyman if I've no got my nice and tidy wee shirt and shoes on.

1594
02:51:06,760 --> 02:51:10,760
He's got, look, he's got a method, all I'm saying, he's got a method and it works.

1595
02:51:10,760 --> 02:51:23,760
Oh, okay, I take it back. I apologize. That was kind of really obvious, it wasn't just clothes, I'm sorry, I'm dumb.

1596
02:51:23,760 --> 02:51:30,760
He doesn't want to do it, he's angry. I got scared there.

1597
02:51:30,760 --> 02:51:35,760
It's because he's angry, he doesn't want to do it.

1598
02:51:35,760 --> 02:51:38,760
That actually don't scare me, I'm gonna lie like this.

1599
02:51:38,760 --> 02:51:42,760
Rome, it was not built in a day.

1600
02:51:42,760 --> 02:51:46,760
Alright, what's the first bank we blow up?

1601
02:51:46,760 --> 02:51:51,760
The people cannot owe debts if there's no one to owe the debts to.

1602
02:51:51,760 --> 02:51:57,760
And remember, the banks are just entities at the end of the day, they are concepts.

1603
02:51:57,760 --> 02:52:02,760
Is that her?

1604
02:52:02,760 --> 02:52:06,760
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that out loud, I'm getting a bit too carried away.

1605
02:52:06,760 --> 02:52:15,760
I'm sorry, John Wick's going through me, I shouldn't have said that.

1606
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:33,760
So is this...

1607
02:52:33,760 --> 02:52:42,760
Of course it seems Julius, they didn't even try.

1608
02:52:42,760 --> 02:52:50,760
The YouTube transcript's probably going wild, true.

1609
02:52:50,760 --> 02:53:04,760
This stream is going to be a limited ads, I just know it.

1610
02:53:04,760 --> 02:53:10,760
No. No. No.

1611
02:53:10,760 --> 02:53:18,760
No, no, we're not here for the Pope.

1612
02:53:18,760 --> 02:53:32,760
Why would there be a head on the Pope?

1613
02:53:32,760 --> 02:53:34,760
Thank you.

1614
02:53:34,760 --> 02:53:36,760
I wonder what's inside the room.

1615
02:53:36,760 --> 02:53:40,760
Is there gonna be pew-pews?

1616
02:53:40,760 --> 02:53:44,760
God, everyone freaking knows us, we're so popular, Reflins.

1617
02:53:44,760 --> 02:53:47,760
How are you so popular?

1618
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:09,760
You miss the word why? I mean, the Pope should be on the...

1619
02:54:09,760 --> 02:54:18,760
I mean, if there's religious tax exemptions, why don't the people get it?

1620
02:54:18,760 --> 02:54:20,760
Curious.

1621
02:54:20,760 --> 02:54:22,760
Do we not believe in ourselves?

1622
02:54:22,760 --> 02:54:28,760
Do we not have hope in ourselves? Do we not have souls?

1623
02:54:28,760 --> 02:54:33,760
You.

1624
02:54:33,760 --> 02:54:46,760
Thank you very much, Lady, for leading us to the...

1625
02:54:46,760 --> 02:54:55,760
How does he speak so many lingos?

1626
02:54:55,760 --> 02:55:14,760
Curious.

1627
02:55:14,760 --> 02:55:19,760
I need to do a suit measuring ASMR for you guys.

1628
02:55:19,760 --> 02:55:25,760
When I get down to the area, you already know I'm going to be hovering.

1629
02:55:25,760 --> 02:55:40,760
Oh, inseam, that's what it's called, inseam on the suit.

1630
02:55:40,760 --> 02:55:43,760
I need to wear wear.

1631
02:55:43,760 --> 02:55:54,760
All the economy and monetary traffic behind that in Italy is another way to talk about the mafia.

1632
02:55:54,760 --> 02:55:59,760
11.5 inches, how's anyone supposed to fit that?

1633
02:55:59,760 --> 02:56:02,760
Teasing.

1634
02:56:10,760 --> 02:56:21,760
A badass sweatshop lady, hello?

1635
02:56:21,760 --> 02:56:26,760
She's a trained assassin?

1636
02:56:26,760 --> 02:56:36,760
Yeah.

1637
02:56:36,760 --> 02:56:40,760
Manila and foils.

1638
02:56:40,760 --> 02:56:47,760
Oh, I've not seen that.

1639
02:56:47,760 --> 02:56:50,760
Am I?

1640
02:56:50,760 --> 02:56:55,760
My hands get wet at the end of an evening too.

1641
02:56:55,760 --> 02:56:58,760
It's just too easy, I'm sorry.

1642
02:56:58,760 --> 02:57:01,760
Oh my god, it's Mercy Modest!

1643
02:57:01,760 --> 02:57:14,760
I hate myself, I hate myself, why did I come up with that?

1644
02:57:14,760 --> 02:57:17,760
Next, so we fondle abysm.

1645
02:57:17,760 --> 02:57:20,760
Late epic joke.

1646
02:57:20,760 --> 02:57:23,760
Oh, sorry, my wee chair clip just came off.

1647
02:57:23,760 --> 02:57:29,760
Anyone else? Happy hunting.

1648
02:57:29,760 --> 02:57:34,760
He has a bit more tact with it.

1649
02:57:34,760 --> 02:57:41,760
I might need to burp a little.

1650
02:57:41,760 --> 02:57:45,760
Fortune's Fortuna means good luck or something.

1651
02:57:45,760 --> 02:57:49,760
Fortuna, bonafortuna is good luck.

1652
02:57:49,760 --> 02:57:52,760
What does this back tattoo say?

1653
02:57:52,760 --> 02:57:54,760
Someone googled it for me right now.

1654
02:57:54,760 --> 02:57:59,760
What does John Wicks tattoo say?

1655
02:57:59,760 --> 02:58:03,760
Type that in right now, go.

1656
02:58:03,760 --> 02:58:06,760
Something fortune, fortune favors the bold.

1657
02:58:06,760 --> 02:58:09,760
I knew it was fortune.

1658
02:58:09,760 --> 02:58:11,760
I knew it, I knew it.

1659
02:58:11,760 --> 02:58:14,760
Fortuna, Fortuna means fortune.

1660
02:58:14,760 --> 02:58:17,760
Oh, it's Latin?

1661
02:58:17,760 --> 02:58:20,760
Oops.

1662
02:58:20,760 --> 02:58:24,760
I remember my mum said she took Latin in school and I was like, ain't that lingo dead?

1663
02:58:24,760 --> 02:58:31,760
And I was like, well, dead spoken but or something, I don't know.

1664
02:58:31,760 --> 02:58:36,760
Oh look, he's gone up the cobblestones where the horsies used to clop-a-dee-clop up.

1665
02:58:37,760 --> 02:58:45,760
Oh, did you hear they found a new room in Pompey with blue wallpaper paint?

1666
02:58:45,760 --> 02:58:47,760
Like blue paint on the walls.

1667
02:58:47,760 --> 02:58:49,760
I'm so sorry if that's really boring.

1668
02:58:49,760 --> 02:58:55,760
But Pompey is the, I don't know, Ashen site of the volcanic in Italy

1669
02:58:55,760 --> 02:58:58,760
and they discovered a new room that used blue wall paint

1670
02:58:58,760 --> 02:59:00,760
and there's something about the paint that's really specific

1671
02:59:00,760 --> 02:59:04,760
because it got phased out in culture or something

1672
02:59:04,760 --> 02:59:10,760
and they don't know what the connection is with Italy having access to this blue paint.

1673
02:59:10,760 --> 02:59:12,760
Whoa, AC again!

1674
02:59:12,760 --> 02:59:16,760
Come on, AC, have you got the blue going for her?

1675
02:59:21,760 --> 02:59:23,760
Oh, come on, AC, take it away.

1676
02:59:23,760 --> 02:59:26,760
You look nothing like AC but it's close enough, close enough.

1677
02:59:27,760 --> 02:59:33,760
Okay, maybe AC is on the DJ stand and not the singer.

1678
02:59:33,760 --> 02:59:34,760
Because...

1679
02:59:37,760 --> 02:59:39,760
Il Colosseum.

1680
02:59:45,760 --> 02:59:46,760
Oh?

1681
02:59:47,760 --> 02:59:50,760
Target acquired.

1682
02:59:50,760 --> 02:59:52,760
Target acquired.

1683
02:59:53,760 --> 02:59:55,760
And the wise words of...

1684
03:00:50,760 --> 03:01:03,760
Look how low the bass player's, the guitar guy's legs were.

1685
03:01:03,760 --> 03:01:06,760
He was like squatting playing the guitar there.

1686
03:01:06,760 --> 03:01:08,760
I'm so sorry.

1687
03:01:10,760 --> 03:01:13,760
Italy taking a little, little ducky.

1688
03:01:20,760 --> 03:01:45,760
That's a man, so that ain't AC on it.

1689
03:01:46,760 --> 03:01:49,760
Look how low his wee legs are getting, sorry.

1690
03:01:49,760 --> 03:01:51,760
It looks very strange.

1691
03:01:51,760 --> 03:01:55,760
I think maybe because he's wearing skinny jeans, he looks like a little stick.

1692
03:01:56,760 --> 03:01:59,760
He looks like a praying mantis playing the guitar.

1693
03:02:01,760 --> 03:02:03,760
Where's wee legs going then?

1694
03:02:05,760 --> 03:02:06,760
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1695
03:02:06,760 --> 03:02:08,760
I think I'm delirious from all the crying earlier.

1696
03:02:08,760 --> 03:02:12,760
He's literally going to end up then just playing the guitar.

1697
03:02:12,760 --> 03:02:13,760
I'm so sorry.

1698
03:02:13,760 --> 03:02:15,760
Honestly.

1699
03:02:24,760 --> 03:02:26,760
I need a fur.

1700
03:02:31,760 --> 03:02:33,760
I almost popped a blood vessel.

1701
03:02:34,760 --> 03:02:36,760
Try and get that one out.

1702
03:02:42,760 --> 03:02:51,760
The praying mantis confirmed absolutely not.

1703
03:02:51,760 --> 03:03:12,760
Oh, cutthroat business women.

1704
03:03:12,760 --> 03:03:14,760
Maven Black Briar, clearly.

1705
03:03:14,760 --> 03:03:17,760
That's a Skyrim reference for you, if you want.

1706
03:03:28,760 --> 03:03:30,760
Oh, I'll refresh in your makeup all right.

1707
03:03:30,760 --> 03:03:31,760
Glup, glup, glup.

1708
03:03:31,760 --> 03:03:33,760
Oh, wait.

1709
03:03:33,760 --> 03:03:35,760
What is this little paper?

1710
03:03:35,760 --> 03:03:37,760
What is this little paper?

1711
03:04:00,760 --> 03:04:02,760
Are we in here with her?

1712
03:04:05,760 --> 03:04:07,760
No.

1713
03:04:08,760 --> 03:04:10,760
That was so cool.

1714
03:04:30,760 --> 03:04:32,760
I have a lot of friends.

1715
03:04:33,760 --> 03:04:35,760
Oh, no.

1716
03:04:44,760 --> 03:04:46,760
I like the way they've done subtitles.

1717
03:04:48,760 --> 03:04:50,760
Your brother.

1718
03:04:51,760 --> 03:04:53,760
You have to tell her who.

1719
03:04:54,760 --> 03:04:56,760
Your brother.

1720
03:05:01,760 --> 03:05:04,760
She knows, she knows, she knows, she knows.

1721
03:05:06,760 --> 03:05:09,760
Now for a seat at this table.

1722
03:05:09,760 --> 03:05:11,760
My way.

1723
03:05:11,760 --> 03:05:13,760
My way.

1724
03:05:36,760 --> 03:05:38,760
Yes.

1725
03:05:39,760 --> 03:05:43,760
She understands, no.

1726
03:05:52,760 --> 03:05:55,760
She's not even mad, like she understands.

1727
03:06:09,760 --> 03:06:11,760
We can't win.

1728
03:06:17,760 --> 03:06:20,760
She understands, she's not going to fight or anything.

1729
03:06:20,760 --> 03:06:22,760
She accepts it with grace.

1730
03:06:24,760 --> 03:06:26,760
Oh, my lady.

1731
03:06:26,760 --> 03:06:28,760
My lady.

1732
03:06:36,760 --> 03:06:38,760
My lady.

1733
03:06:38,760 --> 03:06:40,760
My lady.

1734
03:06:40,760 --> 03:06:42,760
My lady, I didn't even see that.

1735
03:06:42,760 --> 03:06:44,760
My lady.

1736
03:06:44,760 --> 03:06:46,760
Wait, I don't understand.

1737
03:06:46,760 --> 03:06:48,760
Is she like poison up her butt or something?

1738
03:06:48,760 --> 03:06:50,760
Is she just, I think she's accepting it.

1739
03:06:57,760 --> 03:06:59,760
Well, considering he's maintaining eye contact,

1740
03:06:59,760 --> 03:07:01,760
I only look at my wife.

1741
03:07:03,760 --> 03:07:05,760
Oh, her hair clip was a weapon.

1742
03:07:05,760 --> 03:07:07,760
But she chose not to.

1743
03:07:10,760 --> 03:07:13,760
Oh, my God, she's actually accepting it.

1744
03:07:21,760 --> 03:07:23,760
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1745
03:07:23,760 --> 03:07:25,760
Out on her own terms.

1746
03:07:25,760 --> 03:07:27,760
Oh, please.

1747
03:07:27,760 --> 03:07:29,760
Oh, please.

1748
03:07:31,760 --> 03:07:33,760
It doesn't have to be this way.

1749
03:07:37,760 --> 03:07:39,760
She doesn't want exploded.

1750
03:07:42,760 --> 03:07:44,760
Oh, my God, that visual is so cool.

1751
03:07:46,760 --> 03:07:48,760
No, darling.

1752
03:07:54,760 --> 03:07:56,760
Oh, no.

1753
03:08:00,760 --> 03:08:02,760
Oh, that symbolism, though.

1754
03:08:02,760 --> 03:08:04,760
Look at the way her feet crossed over.

1755
03:08:13,760 --> 03:08:16,760
Please don't think I didn't catch that symbolism in her pose.

1756
03:08:16,760 --> 03:08:19,760
Please don't think I didn't catch that symbolism in her pose.

1757
03:08:23,760 --> 03:08:25,760
No.

1758
03:08:29,760 --> 03:08:32,760
Oh, that feels so terrible.

1759
03:08:37,760 --> 03:08:39,760
It was your brother.

1760
03:08:39,760 --> 03:08:41,760
Oh.

1761
03:08:46,760 --> 03:08:48,760
It was your brother.

1762
03:08:52,760 --> 03:08:54,760
We're here for you.

1763
03:08:54,760 --> 03:08:56,760
Oh, I feel so sad for her.

1764
03:08:56,760 --> 03:08:58,760
No.

1765
03:09:02,760 --> 03:09:04,760
Oh.

1766
03:09:09,760 --> 03:09:11,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1767
03:09:11,760 --> 03:09:13,760
Wait.

1768
03:09:13,760 --> 03:09:17,760
Oh, she asked to go pretty.

1769
03:09:19,760 --> 03:09:22,760
John, she asked to go pretty.

1770
03:09:22,760 --> 03:09:24,760
That's why she did that.

1771
03:09:24,760 --> 03:09:27,760
She didn't want a big blast on her freaking cranium.

1772
03:09:31,760 --> 03:09:34,760
For fuck's sake, men don't understand.

1773
03:09:35,760 --> 03:09:39,760
She wanted to be a pretty corpse on her own terms for fuck's sake, John.

1774
03:09:40,760 --> 03:09:43,760
AC, you better turn them tunes down, I'm region.

1775
03:09:45,760 --> 03:09:47,760
John, you dance.

1776
03:09:47,760 --> 03:09:49,760
Oh, no.

1777
03:09:50,760 --> 03:09:52,760
We got clocked.

1778
03:09:52,760 --> 03:09:54,760
Ah.

1779
03:10:07,760 --> 03:10:10,760
Oh, she didn't know.

1780
03:10:10,760 --> 03:10:12,760
Good night.

1781
03:10:23,760 --> 03:10:25,760
Oh.

1782
03:10:41,760 --> 03:10:44,760
She did get to go out on her own way.

1783
03:10:44,760 --> 03:10:47,760
I know John has to confirm the job, but...

1784
03:10:48,760 --> 03:10:50,760
Oh, I guess team is of the essence.

1785
03:10:50,760 --> 03:10:52,760
You can't be messing around.

1786
03:10:53,760 --> 03:10:55,760
Fucking AC, get it.

1787
03:11:01,760 --> 03:11:03,760
On stage?

1788
03:11:03,760 --> 03:11:06,760
Wait, they think it's a plot?

1789
03:11:06,760 --> 03:11:08,760
Like a...

1790
03:11:09,760 --> 03:11:11,760
Okay, okay.

1791
03:11:11,760 --> 03:11:15,760
Uh, high civilian casually, right?

1792
03:11:41,760 --> 03:11:43,760
What?

1793
03:11:49,760 --> 03:11:51,760
What?

1794
03:11:59,760 --> 03:12:02,760
A good blood detail on the kills.

1795
03:12:12,760 --> 03:12:14,760
Yeah.

1796
03:12:19,760 --> 03:12:21,760
Oh, she's gone.

1797
03:12:24,760 --> 03:12:27,760
Damn, they must have had to edit the Krammer crew out of that mirror shot.

1798
03:12:27,760 --> 03:12:29,760
I just...

1799
03:12:36,760 --> 03:12:38,760
Oh, it hurts.

1800
03:12:38,760 --> 03:12:41,760
A bullet just dropped off of him, that's actually such a good detail.

1801
03:12:41,760 --> 03:12:44,760
I wouldn't even consider that, but yeah, if a bullet gets stopped,

1802
03:12:44,760 --> 03:12:47,760
it could just be attached to the core of him.

1803
03:12:55,760 --> 03:12:57,760
I think we just got the patchy.

1804
03:12:57,760 --> 03:13:01,760
I'll actually just pop him off like a bit ASMR,

1805
03:13:01,760 --> 03:13:06,760
but like bullets like popping off of a bullet thing.

1806
03:13:08,760 --> 03:13:12,760
Well, I can't even see shit, I don't even know about you, lads, but...

1807
03:13:12,760 --> 03:13:15,760
Fuck it, I'll need my glicks on for this scene.

1808
03:13:15,760 --> 03:13:17,760
It's a bit cloudy.

1809
03:13:19,760 --> 03:13:21,760
It's the lady.

1810
03:13:31,760 --> 03:13:34,760
He double-crossed us?

1811
03:13:39,760 --> 03:13:42,760
We were double-crossed?

1812
03:13:46,760 --> 03:13:49,760
Well, now we can't let him take the throne at all.

1813
03:13:49,760 --> 03:13:52,760
He is not getting a seat at the high table.

1814
03:13:52,760 --> 03:13:56,760
If anything, I'll take over for the Italians myself.

1815
03:13:56,760 --> 03:13:59,760
Uh, first business, um...

1816
03:13:59,760 --> 03:14:02,760
Uh, first business, um...

1817
03:14:02,760 --> 03:14:05,760
First business, um...

1818
03:14:05,760 --> 03:14:08,760
First business, um...

1819
03:14:08,760 --> 03:14:12,760
I don't know, I don't know what business.

1820
03:14:12,760 --> 03:14:15,760
More Italian vichaburus, yay!

1821
03:14:15,760 --> 03:14:17,760
First business.

1822
03:14:17,760 --> 03:14:20,760
We bring anime to Italy.

1823
03:14:23,760 --> 03:14:27,760
All I'm saying is, hear me out, lollipop, pope.

1824
03:14:27,760 --> 03:14:30,760
Make it a meatball.

1825
03:14:30,760 --> 03:14:33,760
A lollipop, honestly.

1826
03:14:33,760 --> 03:14:36,760
That's actually really good, I wish I could do that.

1827
03:14:36,760 --> 03:14:39,760
Mmm, that's not crillage.

1828
03:14:42,760 --> 03:14:45,760
Well, look at the way that mag went flying.

1829
03:14:45,760 --> 03:14:50,760
U stationed, south-east.

1830
03:14:50,760 --> 03:14:53,760
Well, we're taking a hammer-in.

1831
03:15:00,760 --> 03:15:03,760
U don't know what to do.

1832
03:15:08,760 --> 03:15:11,760
Well, we'll see you there later.

1833
03:15:11,760 --> 03:15:24,200
come on reflins come on reflins you can do it

1834
03:15:24,200 --> 03:15:48,200
yeah I'm gonna have to admit fidgety ammo reload not a fan

1835
03:15:48,200 --> 03:15:56,800
too precise with the amount of adrenaline that would go through you too

1836
03:15:56,800 --> 03:16:03,960
precise for a reload although John Wick's probably used it now

1837
03:16:08,800 --> 03:16:15,960
brutal a brutal

1838
03:16:18,200 --> 03:16:45,760
you are not winning against a showy

1839
03:16:45,760 --> 03:17:04,520
the spread on the pellets can be just so just too much John probably forgets how

1840
03:17:04,520 --> 03:17:07,800
to reload when he doesn't have adrenaline literally start missing in

1841
03:17:07,800 --> 03:17:11,280
stuff he's like hey where's that where's the shaky hands he's already used to the

1842
03:17:11,280 --> 03:17:14,560
shake

1843
03:17:17,960 --> 03:17:22,440

1976
03:36:59,400 --> 03:37:05,880
Don't be scared. We mean no harm. We're just having a wee bicker. We had a business deal go sour

1977
03:37:05,880 --> 03:37:08,000

1988
03:38:22,560 --> 03:38:24,560
Okay

I feel like that'd be so cool

2000

03:52:16,600 --> 03:52:22,640
I'm terrible for appreciating art unless it's like the old drawn stuff like at the Vatican in that

2105
03:52:24,240 --> 03:52:27,440

Okay, first rule when we take over Italy is

04:12:01,400 --> 04:12:05,880
Uh, so we're doing good. Okay, that's when you know i'm doing good. Right. Let's do that

2269
04:12:40,840 --> 04:12:43,640
So if anyone's like, oh when are you going to watch this sad film? Never

2270
04:12:44,120 --> 04:12:48,520
I literally can't handle it. My eyes are so puffed up right now. I'm like

2271
04:12:49,000 --> 04:12:55,160
I'm wishing that. Oh wait, I forgot. I'm supposed to be a ventriloquist because for some reason my microphone is out of sync for a second

2272
04:12:55,160 --> 04:13:01,240
So it looks really weird. Hello, and I'm starting calls. Let's go. I'm also a ventriloquist. Hey

2275
04:13:14,280 --> 04:13:16,280

Okay, right

2278
04:13:30,920 --> 04:13:33,800
I've actually not seen how to train your dragon like after the first one

2279
04:13:33,960 --> 04:13:37,240
I don't know if I saw the second one, but I remember the first one because fish legs

04:13:37,480 --> 04:13:39,480

Strongly fighting the toilet demons stay strong. No genuinely. I was on the

2322
04:25:49,720 --> 04:25:51,560
And then it you know

2323
04:25:51,560 --> 04:25:57,560
It all went well. How do we feel about john wick so far? I am blown away by the series

2324
04:25:58,040 --> 04:26:02,840
I am very nervous for what's about to occur in movie number three

2325
04:26:03,640 --> 04:26:06,920
So very quick recap if I understand correctly

2326
04:26:07,880 --> 04:26:16,040
We have been excommunicadoed and now all assassins worldwide have a 14 million

2327
04:26:16,920 --> 04:26:18,920
us dollar

2328
04:26:18,920 --> 04:26:20,040
bounty

2329
04:26:20,040 --> 04:26:26,280
On the head of beloved john wick or it also known as refling also known as me because

2330
04:26:26,760 --> 04:26:30,440
I insert us into movies because I think it's fun to be like are we gonna get do it?

2331
04:26:30,440 --> 04:26:33,640
Come on you can do it like I like doing that. I don't know if that's just me

2332
04:26:34,040 --> 04:26:36,040
but yeah

2333
04:26:36,040 --> 04:26:40,120
This is one of the many reasons why I love you because you explain in such detail

2334
04:26:40,760 --> 04:26:47,320
Your horrendous fight in the why is it called a restroom if I'm fighting for my life in here?

2335
04:26:49,800 --> 04:26:51,480
Okay

2336
04:26:51,480 --> 04:26:53,320
As everyone got john

2337
04:26:53,320 --> 04:26:59,560
Three opened up also. Congrats. If your name's john john john johnny jonathan john

2338
04:26:59,960 --> 04:27:03,640
I'm scaring the absolute crap out of the one person that's called john right now

2339
04:27:04,120 --> 04:27:06,120
Apologies, um

2340
04:27:06,920 --> 04:27:13,080
Or if your name's winston, but I think you would be an og san if you're a winston because that's kind of like a later name big johnny boy

2341
04:27:14,520 --> 04:27:16,920
Um, I have to go to sleep now. Thank you so much for the stream

2342
04:27:17,000 --> 04:27:24,040
No, thank you so much for the stream because I just get to fucking goof off and edge myself and edgeville with wines

2343
04:27:24,600 --> 04:27:26,760
I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that part out loud

2344
04:27:27,160 --> 04:27:28,760
um

2345
04:27:28,760 --> 04:27:36,200
I'm starting to lose the filter slightly. I I think because of the emotional turmoil that was the first, um

2346
04:27:37,320 --> 04:27:42,520
Movie I have to admit. I did not recall any of those sad scenes

2347
04:27:43,400 --> 04:27:44,520
and

2348
04:27:44,520 --> 04:27:51,160
I only cried a little bit in the second one. So surely by the third movie. I'm not shedding any tears

2349
04:27:51,720 --> 04:27:56,520
Surely there shall be no tears shed. I'm a big girl. Okay

2350
04:27:57,480 --> 04:28:02,920
Um, I have two hours 10 minutes and 46 seconds. You can actually see it up top

2351
04:28:03,000 --> 04:28:05,800
It's loaded one second in how cheeky of this

2352
04:28:06,440 --> 04:28:08,680
No tears here. Maybe hopefully not

2353
04:28:10,920 --> 04:28:12,920
Um

2354
04:28:13,320 --> 04:28:16,920
Right, are we all ready? Do we have movie number three opened up?

2355
04:28:18,840 --> 04:28:20,520
Okay

2356
04:28:20,520 --> 04:28:26,280
Three on go on go. We say we do on go. Okay three two one go

2357
04:28:28,520 --> 04:28:31,400
Let us see sorry, I did that far too early all the wines

2358
04:28:31,800 --> 04:28:35,800
Let us see what movie number three has in store for us

2359
04:28:36,280 --> 04:28:41,880
Now that we have a 14 million bounty on our head. I don't even know what that would be in today's money

2360
04:28:42,280 --> 04:28:46,040
I feel like it would probably have inflated to like 21 million at least

2361
04:28:46,280 --> 04:28:48,280
Um

2362
04:28:48,440 --> 04:28:50,440
I have two hours and 10

2363
04:28:50,840 --> 04:28:55,880
Well, I I have an extra second because my dad works at microsoft there. Take that

Um, what's that game called on nintendo where you run about?

So i'm gonna test if my iPhone can track me in the bathroom. It's not that far away from the pc

Isn't the dog getting cold? Oh wait, I was gonna say this dog has short fur

2402
04:32:40,040 --> 04:32:42,280
Aren't these dogs not suited for weather like that?

2403
04:32:44,360 --> 04:32:46,360
Winston knows how it is

2404
04:32:47,160 --> 04:32:49,160
A library

2405
04:32:49,640 --> 04:32:52,120
What does he know that we don't know a library?

2406
04:32:53,400 --> 04:32:55,400
I

2407
04:32:57,400 --> 04:32:59,400
Stuck

04:33:29,480 --> 04:33:33,160
He's gonna be safe. He's safe. He's safe. That's that's fine

2411
04:33:34,600 --> 04:33:36,600
Now we need to make sure reefing safe

2412
04:33:38,120 --> 04:33:43,720
Fuck you know right what happens in the library. What's so special about a library? There must be something in it

2413
04:33:43,800 --> 04:33:45,800
I

2414
04:33:49,960 --> 04:33:53,480
Shoes clacking on the ground while everyone's trying to study and research

Wonder if it's hard to get a dog not to look at the camera because babies and like toddlers and like child actors always

2702
05:20:33,400 --> 05:20:35,400
Look at the camera. They have to tell him to knock it off

2731
05:25:40,100 --> 05:25:45,100
Okay, John, Wick and Sophia on the exact same page.

Oh! Kidding shot!

2735
05:26:13,100 --> 05:26:18,100
That dog mustn't have any hearing from the how loud those shots are, but...

Unconservative of the bullets.

2760
05:29:22,100 --> 05:29:25,100
Given that he hasn't died, infinite.

2761
05:29:29,100 --> 05:29:31,100
This feels like a time crisis.

2762
05:29:39,100 --> 05:29:43,100
Okay, okay, okay, did... did...

2763
05:29:43,100 --> 05:29:48,100
Poppers! Poppers!

2764
05:30:13,100 --> 05:30:15,100
We need a puppy

2765
05:30:23,100 --> 05:30:30,140
Okay, I don't I don't see GI but I've seen like those dogs. I get trained to do that like jump crazy. Hey

2766
05:30:35,500 --> 05:30:37,500
Oh

2767
05:30:43,100 --> 05:30:49,420
I pump can you did fantastic

2768
05:31:07,180 --> 05:31:09,580
Oh my god, these dogs are crazy

2769
05:31:14,060 --> 05:31:16,060
I

2770
05:31:22,940 --> 05:31:27,020
Think that dog got confused it's supposed to go in the same window as the other one, but it's fine. It's fine

2771
05:31:29,020 --> 05:31:32,700
Even up a tree can't save you from your boss getting bitten off honestly

2772
05:31:34,300 --> 05:31:38,700
Right, so are we unironically going on a constellation quest?

2773
05:31:43,180 --> 05:31:52,940
You tell me the elder of the high table is sitting about in the desert

2774
05:31:57,580 --> 05:32:02,540
Just hanging around the back satellite surveillance can't even find them

2775
05:32:05,500 --> 05:32:07,500
There you go poppers

2776
05:32:13,260 --> 05:32:15,260
Oh

2777
05:32:26,780 --> 05:32:28,780
Are you sure about that?

2778
05:32:30,700 --> 05:32:34,940
Oh, what bird tonight is tetanus, sorry the other one

2779
05:32:37,180 --> 05:32:39,180
I didn't see any Annie back on that point

2780
05:32:39,180 --> 05:32:41,180
I

2781
05:32:42,700 --> 05:32:46,700
Know the three fly on his suit I saw that don't think I didn't notice the fly on his suit

2782
05:32:48,220 --> 05:32:51,180
It's sucking up all them the moisture off of you every fun

2783
05:33:02,220 --> 05:33:04,220
Really

2784
05:33:10,060 --> 05:33:12,060
You

2785
05:33:15,020 --> 05:33:17,020
Really

2786
05:33:29,180 --> 05:33:34,060
Really did we not just save her daughter and hide her and keep her safe

2787
05:33:34,860 --> 05:33:36,860
Oh

2788
05:33:37,420 --> 05:33:40,620
My god, we actually are just going on a random desert quest

2789
05:33:41,260 --> 05:33:43,820
My brother you are going to perish so quickly

2790
05:33:44,940 --> 05:33:50,460
And no drinking your pee in the desert doesn't work. You're filtering out urea, which is the

2791
05:33:51,180 --> 05:33:54,940
Like basically the straight poison your body can't handle it is why it's a byproduct

2792
05:33:55,980 --> 05:33:57,980
so no

2793
05:33:58,380 --> 05:34:00,380
Better drink your own

2794
05:34:00,700 --> 05:34:02,700
doesn't work

2795
05:34:02,700 --> 05:34:06,060
And at night in the desert I get sub below temperatures

2796
05:34:10,620 --> 05:34:14,540
Oh my god, there's gonna be a sandworm for dune coming out of nowhere in a minute

2797
05:34:21,260 --> 05:34:23,260
Okay

2798
05:34:23,980 --> 05:34:27,500
Well, this is where the quest ends clearly because we've just perished

2799
05:34:29,260 --> 05:34:31,260
Mummy can you do that too? Oh

2800
05:34:32,780 --> 05:34:35,180
You may spit water out and make you drink it

2801
05:34:37,500 --> 05:34:39,500
Seven days

2802
05:34:43,500 --> 05:34:45,500
No, no, no

2803
05:34:45,980 --> 05:34:47,340
No

2804
05:34:47,340 --> 05:34:53,340
Oh my god, right saws, but the yakuza is taking the mic. This is a soup kitchen

2805
05:34:55,100 --> 05:35:00,380
We feed the homeless fur just a human right shock and behavior honestly

2806
05:35:03,340 --> 05:35:10,540
Wait, is he is he gonna die? No, no, no, no, no, no wait, is Winston gonna die as well?

2807
05:35:13,260 --> 05:35:15,260
Oh my gosh

2808
05:35:18,940 --> 05:35:20,940
Oh, this cannot be

2809
05:35:27,180 --> 05:35:29,180
Oh, this cannot be

2810
05:35:30,060 --> 05:35:32,060
No, no, no

2811
05:35:33,500 --> 05:35:36,140
Come on pigeons have laser beams or something

2812
05:35:37,020 --> 05:35:44,300
Stun them stun them so we can shoot them. I don't want him to perish. Okay. Yeah, the seven bullets was mean, but

2813
05:35:45,980 --> 05:35:47,980
Oh

2814
05:35:48,540 --> 05:35:50,540
Oh

2815
05:36:00,700 --> 05:36:02,700
Come on

2816
05:36:03,900 --> 05:36:07,260
Oh, is this good or bad you're smiling is this good or bad?

2817
05:36:11,980 --> 05:36:13,980
I'll fuck off you

2818
05:36:18,620 --> 05:36:20,620
You

2819
05:36:43,900 --> 05:36:45,900
Eh

2820
05:36:48,700 --> 05:36:50,700
But he's gonna bleed out

2821
05:37:00,460 --> 05:37:02,460
Uh

2822
05:37:10,060 --> 05:37:12,060
But Mother Moselle got to live

2823
05:37:12,060 --> 05:37:14,060
Oh

2824
05:37:21,580 --> 05:37:25,580
He maybe could have survived maybe I don't know

2825
05:37:28,380 --> 05:37:31,660
I'd cut the gene. Please help us. Oh, thank god

2826
05:37:34,780 --> 05:37:38,940
When no one would touch Winston like that, but I didn't want him to oh

2827
05:37:42,380 --> 05:37:44,380
You

2828
05:37:53,900 --> 05:37:55,900
The elder

2829
05:38:05,900 --> 05:38:09,580
The elder above the high table is a dude in a desert

2830
05:38:12,860 --> 05:38:15,340
Uh, maybe he likes the humble life

2831
05:38:26,300 --> 05:38:28,300
Uh

2832
05:38:31,900 --> 05:38:35,500
It was a few things went wrong that could have gone better, okay

2833
05:38:42,780 --> 05:38:44,780
So

2834
05:38:50,300 --> 05:38:52,300
Oh

2835
05:38:53,340 --> 05:38:55,340
I better not start crying

2836
05:39:06,220 --> 05:39:08,220
Yes elder

2837
05:39:13,020 --> 05:39:16,620
Yes, what's it? Yes

2838
05:39:27,580 --> 05:39:29,580
We don't want that life elder

2839
05:39:34,940 --> 05:39:36,940
No

2840
05:39:42,700 --> 05:39:46,700
We want to retire

2841
05:39:54,380 --> 05:39:56,380
What are you gonna do John?

2842
05:39:59,500 --> 05:40:05,580
Oh, okay, okay, okay contract. No, you liar

2843

My hands are on my head right now you're lying

2845
05:40:25,180 --> 05:40:30,380
Surely you meant like Winston Churchill the one in the casket and it's all a big misunderstanding not the

2846
05:40:31,100 --> 05:40:33,100

05:40:33,740 --> 05:40:35,740

05:45:46,940 --> 05:45:48,940
That's rough

2898
05:46:09,980 --> 05:46:11,980
So we're

2899
05:46:14,620 --> 05:46:18,780
The continental rules still apply even though we were the one to break them

2900
05:46:20,860 --> 05:46:22,860
And now it's a race back

2901
05:46:24,860 --> 05:46:30,140
Fucking hell they're going a bit fast. I don't know cgi but come on mate

My god is Batman Arkham returns or something. I don't know that one Batman scene where they're under the bridge. I can't remember

2904
05:47:00,140 --> 05:47:02,140

Okay, the numbers are in our favor the odds are getting higher

2908
05:47:44,300 --> 05:47:46,300
Well

2909
05:47:49,260 --> 05:47:52,300
I'm gonna be honest. I probably would have held onto the sword but that's just me

2910
05:47:53,340 --> 05:47:55,820
Well the rules apply now that you're officially pardoned

2911
05:48:00,140 --> 05:48:03,740
So now it's just the high table actors. We need to be worried about

2912
05:48:05,180 --> 05:48:10,940
The dark night. Yeah, wear a helmet dress for the slade not for the raid

2913
05:48:14,700 --> 05:48:18,380
I've never been on a motorbike before but apparently it's really exhilarating

2914
05:48:20,940 --> 05:48:22,940
Get inside get inside get inside

2915

Surely by the end of this one we give that name

2935
05:50:57,420 --> 05:50:59,420
We're going for five languages

2936
05:51:13,820 --> 05:51:15,820
Yes

2937
05:51:17,100 --> 05:51:19,100

2942
05:51:36,380 --> 05:51:41,340
I have really bad news, but i'm not really sure what the result of this is gonna be because

2943
05:51:42,220 --> 05:51:46,940
I don't think john would kill Winston. It doesn't make sense

2944
05:51:49,820 --> 05:51:52,060
I feel like something else has to occur

2945
05:51:56,140 --> 05:51:58,140
Mr. Winston

2946
05:52:09,900 --> 05:52:11,900

2947
05:52:19,100 --> 05:52:21,100

No

2951
05:52:56,620 --> 05:52:58,620
There has to be another way

It's a lot of ammo

3037
06:06:08,060 --> 06:06:11,340
I'll take that I'll take my chances without over a pistol II

3038
06:06:18,700 --> 06:06:23,820
I like Winston looks on like a pro father. He's like, yeah, you get on keep keep at it sons

Oh

06:13:04,220 --> 06:13:06,220
Oh

3081
06:13:08,220 --> 06:13:10,220
It's not over

3082
06:13:13,020 --> 06:13:15,020
It's not over

3083
06:13:15,740 --> 06:13:23,900
Go upstairs pop that samurai or armor on do a few Elden Ring rules and you're good to go John. Come on, Johnny boy

06:14:17,020 --> 06:14:20,780
Huh is this a joke what?

3092
06:14:38,700 --> 06:14:44,620
Let him get up let him get up let him get up

3093
06:14:54,460 --> 06:14:58,460
He's telling a ting his bell off all right, okay

3094
06:14:58,460 --> 06:15:00,460
Oh

3095
06:15:08,300 --> 06:15:11,980

06:15:29,180 --> 06:15:31,180
Oh

06:15:43,820 --> 06:15:45,820
Don't kick me in the head

3099
06:15:45,820 --> 06:15:47,820
I

3100
06:15:54,780 --> 06:15:56,940
Actually kind of like these

3101
06:15:56,940 --> 06:15:58,940
fights because it's like it shows

3102
06:15:59,580 --> 06:16:05,900
Obviously it's to show like the desperation more than like a perfectly choreographed fight type thing

3103
06:16:05,980 --> 06:16:10,460
So I just don't like it. I don't mind it. Sorry. Not that. I don't like it. I do like it

3104
06:16:11,740 --> 06:16:15,020
Like I like that is messy. I like we're like fucking scrambling

3105
06:16:16,140 --> 06:16:19,900
Rather than these like perfect executions off the back every single time

3106
06:16:23,100 --> 06:16:25,100
And we're almost there I think

3107
06:16:32,700 --> 06:16:38,460
Now stop it stop hitting me stop hitting yourself stop hitting yourself just can populate

3108
06:16:46,140 --> 06:16:51,820
Oh john winks like wait, that's all is tiana Reeves

3109

No, well it's been a pleasure

3112
06:17:25,260 --> 06:17:27,260
I don't know do you want to ask them

3113
06:17:31,900 --> 06:17:39,900
Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah, stay down stay down stay down. It's all good. Okay, you're next

3200
06:30:16,940 --> 06:30:18,940

3201
06:30:21,500 --> 06:30:23,500
Yeah

3202
06:30:25,180 --> 06:30:27,180
Yeah

3203
06:30:27,180 --> 06:30:29,500
We're doing it. We're going against the high table

3204
06:30:31,900 --> 06:30:35,500
Oh my god, we're doing it. Yeah

3205
06:30:39,740 --> 06:30:44,460
John's becoming a real reflin type of put down the high table wink wink

3206
06:30:45,180 --> 06:30:48,700
Okay, that's gonna be our codename the high table

3207
06:30:50,540 --> 06:30:52,540
I'm real

3208
06:30:55,420 --> 06:30:59,260
Oh my goodness, ah, I'm loving this

3209
06:31:01,580 --> 06:31:04,860
Oh my god, are you to and we in part five isn't even out

3210
06:31:06,220 --> 06:31:08,940
But we're gonna have to watch part four. We have part four now

3211
06:31:09,900 --> 06:31:13,900
Healyberry wait, isn't Healyberry an X-Men?

3212
06:31:17,420 --> 06:31:20,060
John wakers against the world

3213
06:31:22,780 --> 06:31:28,700
Oh my gosh, I'm loving this. Sorry. I completely forgot to do wines during that entire like segment

3214
06:31:29,580 --> 06:31:34,940
Oh, she is she is she is oh my god. We're going against the high table replays

3215
06:31:35,500 --> 06:31:39,660
Yatta, she was the Casablanca lady

3216
06:31:42,780 --> 06:31:49,900
Oh my gosh, we're doing it. We're doing it. Oh my gosh

3217
06:31:53,820 --> 06:31:56,380
Okay, let me change it the title to four

3218
06:31:57,500 --> 06:31:59,500
And then we'll get a quick break

3219
06:32:00,060 --> 06:32:02,060
So I can

3220
06:32:03,020 --> 06:32:06,060
Uh, right pause and then go next one

3221
06:32:07,900 --> 06:32:09,900
You know like next

3222
06:32:10,060 --> 06:32:12,060
That's it and pause

3223
06:32:12,940 --> 06:32:16,940
Does that display? Yep, it does. What? How long is this movie?

3224
06:32:20,460 --> 06:32:23,660
Okay, I'm going to heavily recommend

3225
06:32:24,300 --> 06:32:28,700
Um, everyone get a snack and a stretch and a toilet and a

3226
06:32:29,020 --> 06:32:32,300
Yes, uh, I did not realize

3227
06:32:33,500 --> 06:32:35,900
How long this one is

3228
06:32:38,220 --> 06:32:43,580
So maybe chapter five doesn't play off of four because this is so long

3229
06:32:44,780 --> 06:32:47,500
Maybe we do all of the high table in one go

3230
06:32:48,300 --> 06:32:51,900
Because for a three-hour movie, I feel like you can take out a lot of

3231
06:32:52,940 --> 06:32:57,740
First the lady in the cloak the cloak goes first surely surely

3232
06:32:59,340 --> 06:33:05,100
Well, what do we do about Winston? Do we understand that Winston didn't actually want to kill us?

3233
06:33:05,100 --> 06:33:11,260
Or was he forced to? Is he still an ally? I'm not really sure what because he wasn't like

3234
06:33:11,260 --> 06:33:16,700
Oh, yes, I will destroy John Wick right now. So I'm a bit uh, a bit curious about

3235
06:33:17,980 --> 06:33:23,820
What Winston's arc is I keep bringing out those gloves, but I'm not trying to do a boxing match

3236
06:33:24,780 --> 06:33:27,740
Uh, right, we're gonna find out we're gonna find out no spoilers

3237
06:33:27,740 --> 06:33:33,980
Please the only time I ask for no hand-holding and no spoilers is we're gonna watch John Wick 4

3238
06:33:34,380 --> 06:33:39,660
And I've never seen it. Uh, I don't think I saw it there. I don't really recall any of that

3239
06:33:39,980 --> 06:33:43,100
I'm so glad the concierge got a little bit of a scene

3240
06:33:43,660 --> 06:33:47,580
Um, I wish there was a bit more badassery coming from him

3241
06:33:47,660 --> 06:33:55,900
I feel like the concierge is like the the doting kind of gentle until it's like time to call in the arms

3242
06:33:56,460 --> 06:33:58,460
like that kind of thing

3243
06:33:59,260 --> 06:34:00,860
um

3244
06:34:00,860 --> 06:34:05,180
He shot my bulletproof vest, so I don't know if he meant to keep him alive

3245
06:34:05,740 --> 06:34:07,900
I feel like he would have known he was alive

3246
06:34:07,980 --> 06:34:11,580
But like y'all didn't put like a little crash mat down there for him

3247
06:34:11,980 --> 06:34:15,740
You know, you could have could have moved it away by the time she went down the elevator

3248
06:34:15,740 --> 06:34:21,180
And that's all I'm saying. Okay, the lift takes you know, I'm not saying you've got the fastest lifts in the continental

3249
06:34:21,260 --> 06:34:26,540
But a little crash mat wouldn't have gone amiss. Uh, definitely would have helped out. Um

3250
06:34:28,380 --> 06:34:30,380
But hey ho

3251
06:34:30,380 --> 06:34:35,660
We are alive reefing willing is alive and reefing has been sent into take down the high table

3252
06:34:35,740 --> 06:34:39,660
Which I'm very curious to see how this goes. Um, I also didn't mention

3253
06:34:40,700 --> 06:34:44,140
We're officially in the 30 thousands for our wanes

3254
06:34:44,540 --> 06:34:46,940
um, I believe a

3255
06:34:47,500 --> 06:34:55,100
A lovely reefing has done the maths and they said that my wanes in my bank if I do them

3256
06:34:55,180 --> 06:34:56,780
I am 99

3257
06:34:56,780 --> 06:35:00,220
uh, we are at 36,000 so

3258
06:35:01,580 --> 06:35:02,620
They're

3259
06:35:02,620 --> 06:35:04,620
Maybe if I can get it down to

3260
06:35:05,260 --> 06:35:07,260
20,000

3261
06:35:08,460 --> 06:35:10,620
Oh, I don't know if I have time for 20,000

3262
06:35:11,020 --> 06:35:15,980
Maybe then tomorrow's endurance stream. We might actually do it

3263
06:35:17,100 --> 06:35:24,620
Um, what level of cooking am I now? I am 90 um 100 xp off of 91

3264
06:35:26,300 --> 06:35:31,500
Um, but we are cooking by gas. We're getting there. We're getting close

3265
06:35:32,540 --> 06:35:34,380

3266
06:35:34,380 --> 06:35:38,220
Right, I am going to get a cup of tea. I'm going to get some food. I'm going to get a few snacks

Everyone's like going to start once we get marshmallows back

3274
06:36:07,100 --> 06:36:11,980
Everyone's going to start sending messages that secretly have their name in it and hopes I say like the main name

3275
06:36:12,540 --> 06:36:15,340

Approximately 1.5 of people in the us are named john or some variation of that. Wow. That's a big number

3281
06:36:42,140 --> 06:36:45,180

06:36:55,180 --> 06:36:57,180
We're getting there though

3285
06:36:58,140 --> 06:37:00,140
We're getting there

3286
06:37:00,220 --> 06:37:05,900
Honestly, I don't know if you can speedrun crafting crafting's been I was interested in crafting

3287
06:37:06,860 --> 06:37:13,260
But I maybe would do that in my own time. I'll maybe not uh make you guys watch crafting. I think the runescape streams

3288
06:37:13,820 --> 06:37:16,060
Um, I'm definitely happy to take a bit of a break

3289
06:37:16,620 --> 06:37:21,420
After other than doing questing together ones. I don't mind the questing. Those are those are fun as anything

3290
06:37:22,140 --> 06:37:23,260
um

3291
06:37:23,260 --> 06:37:27,740
But yes, please get a snack. Please go for a tinkle. I'm going to do the exact same

3292
06:37:27,820 --> 06:37:33,420
I'll be a couple of moments and then we'll jump straight back into the john wick. Shall we?

3293
06:37:34,300 --> 06:37:39,900
Crafting is quickish, but it costs a lot of money. You'll never guess how much money I have in my runescape bank account

3294
06:37:40,300 --> 06:37:46,940
Okay, give me a minute. I'll be back uh to make a cup of tea and a pee and you should definitely stretch your legs

3295
06:37:46,940 --> 06:37:48,940
Okay, because we have been sitting for a while

3296
06:37:53,260 --> 06:37:55,980
You

3297
06:38:23,260 --> 06:38:25,260
You

3298
06:38:53,260 --> 06:38:55,260
You

3299
06:39:23,260 --> 06:39:25,260
You

3300
06:39:53,260 --> 06:39:55,260

3301
06:40:03,260 --> 06:40:05,260

3302
06:40:23,260 --> 06:40:25,260
You

3303
06:40:53,260 --> 06:40:55,260
You

3304
06:41:23,260 --> 06:41:25,260
You

3305
06:41:53,260 --> 06:41:55,260
You

3306
06:42:13,340 --> 06:42:19,740
Are you squiddin me right now would you do another members karaoke stream in the near future

3307
06:42:23,260 --> 06:42:25,260
You

3308
06:42:53,260 --> 06:42:55,260
You

3309
06:43:23,260 --> 06:43:25,260
You

3310
06:43:53,260 --> 06:43:55,260
You

3311
06:44:23,260 --> 06:44:25,260
You

3312
06:44:40,300 --> 06:44:41,820
Sorry my

3313
06:44:41,820 --> 06:44:43,820
Fuck that's so bloody loud honestly

3314
06:44:45,020 --> 06:44:51,820
The desktop music is separate and it's so loud when you're not signed in. Oh my god. That was blaring

3315
06:44:53,580 --> 06:44:54,620
Wow

3316
06:44:54,620 --> 06:45:00,140
Thank you. Doomsday damn for the tip and do lay lover via lure for the five

3317
06:45:00,780 --> 06:45:04,060
Would you do another members karaoke stream? Absolutely. Yes. Um

3318
06:45:05,420 --> 06:45:07,420
I think I have like

3319
06:45:08,460 --> 06:45:13,260
I actually don't think it'll be a problem all from my voice because I've already worked it to be honest

3320
06:45:14,060 --> 06:45:16,060
the what right so

3321
06:45:16,540 --> 06:45:20,140
I've permanently damaged my voice, which is fine. It's not a big deal

3322
06:45:20,780 --> 06:45:22,780
but the actual

3323
06:45:23,580 --> 06:45:25,580
The actual

3324
06:45:25,900 --> 06:45:27,900
positive of it is that

3325
06:45:28,700 --> 06:45:33,180
I can keep going now if that makes sense now that is damaged like I can keep going

3326
06:45:34,540 --> 06:45:41,180
And the damage was just singing which doesn't really make much of a difference to me because I don't like I don't have an interest like

3327
06:45:41,580 --> 06:45:48,060
Some vtubers like absolutely have like a full interest in singing for me personally. I couldn't give less about

3328
06:45:49,020 --> 06:45:51,020
Um

3329
06:45:51,340 --> 06:45:54,620
Mum is back. Yes. Oh no the runescape. Yeah

3330
06:45:55,500 --> 06:45:58,060
Still down runescape. You're stuck with me

3331
06:45:59,100 --> 06:46:04,460
Um, right. I've got a cup of sorry. You didn't see that. I've got a cup of tea

3332
06:46:05,340 --> 06:46:11,900
Um, I actually didn't see any snacks that I was interested in so I literally have tea cola and water

3333
06:46:12,220 --> 06:46:13,580
um

3334
06:46:13,580 --> 06:46:18,940
To last me through these three hours. I keep forgetting to boil new eggs so I can just grab them for stream

3335
06:46:19,020 --> 06:46:19,740
but

3336
06:46:19,740 --> 06:46:24,060
It's fine. It's fine. Um as for tomorrow's stream

3337
06:46:26,140 --> 06:46:29,260
It's a 50 50 if it gets changed for something else

3338
06:46:29,340 --> 06:46:33,420
I don't know if I can do two back-to-back endurance streams without absolutely annihilating my health

3339
06:46:33,500 --> 06:46:35,500
I'll see what kind of sleep I get

3340
06:46:35,740 --> 06:46:42,380
But I'm just warning you now. I don't know if we're gonna be able to finish off the wines tomorrow. Um

3341
06:46:43,260 --> 06:46:45,340
because I might be

3342
06:46:45,900 --> 06:46:47,900
um

3343
06:46:47,900 --> 06:46:53,740
Just doing something smaller because I've got a few things to do for the girls. Um, they've been absolutely fantastic. So the

3344
06:46:55,020 --> 06:46:59,420
The editors that work for veal were um, they're getting put to work

3345
06:46:59,500 --> 06:47:01,500
We're gonna see what the kind of price return

3346
06:47:02,060 --> 06:47:04,060
Etc is and then

3347
06:47:04,780 --> 06:47:08,380
Yeah, don't be surprised if you see a hell of a lot more consist

3348
06:47:08,860 --> 06:47:13,100
Short consistency now that the the dust is settled. Um

3349
06:47:13,900 --> 06:47:17,900
We currently have four clippers. I have my own personal clip editor

3350
06:47:18,380 --> 06:47:24,700
Um, but I might hit get her to do some her names are rissa. Hi rissa. I doubt your your but

3351
06:47:25,100 --> 06:47:30,380
Um, she's such a nerd. She plays dnd and she's like oh my dnd cancelled

3352
06:47:30,460 --> 06:47:33,420
I can do some more editing for you and I'm like, oh, that's so adorable

3353
06:47:33,580 --> 06:47:36,220
Are you sure you want to like not take the day off or whatever?

3354
06:47:36,780 --> 06:47:43,340
But um, yeah, rissa's really cool. I like her. Um, and she's Australian. So it makes me even cooler. Um

3355
06:47:44,380 --> 06:47:49,580
I might I'm gonna see if I can get one more clipper on board. Um

3356
06:47:51,340 --> 06:47:53,340
Cause

3357
06:47:54,060 --> 06:47:57,420
Uh, I'm starting to want to get highlight reels of the girls

3358
06:47:58,780 --> 06:48:01,420
And shorts coming out a bit more consistently

3359
06:48:01,660 --> 06:48:07,020
I'm gonna aim for three shorts per week and see how that works out because obviously

3360
06:48:07,580 --> 06:48:11,820
You guys have been fantastic clipping the girls. By the way, I see sent me

3361
06:48:12,220 --> 06:48:18,620
I like instructed the girls on how to how to show me the clips that they want turned into a short on youtube

3362
06:48:19,100 --> 06:48:24,300
And I see came through she was like scrawny. I'm so sorry for all this

3363
06:48:24,540 --> 06:48:28,300
I like do not be silly. You have literally like saved me so much time

3364
06:48:28,380 --> 06:48:35,100
You've given me such high quality clips. Like don't be silly. So thank you special. Thank you to literally anyone who is

3365
06:48:35,340 --> 06:48:37,340
mucking about clipping

3366
06:48:37,740 --> 06:48:45,580
Like any funny ha ha's of any of the girls you help out so much with these shorts that we're gonna start making and posting and all that jazz

3367
06:48:45,900 --> 06:48:47,900
like mercy, um

3368
06:48:48,300 --> 06:48:52,860
Had like a hilarious short. I don't know if you've seen it. Oh, sorry. My cats are going nuts. Um

3369
06:48:53,820 --> 06:48:56,300
I just fed them. So they're probably going to actually not

3370
06:48:57,020 --> 06:48:59,020
Breaking my door. Um

3371
06:48:59,260 --> 06:49:01,420
Mercy had this like hilarious short

3372
06:49:02,220 --> 06:49:06,620
Someone asked her like, oh, are you going to do a cooking stream? And she told the story about a time

3373
06:49:06,860 --> 06:49:12,620
She freaking was cutting upside down with a knife and I'm like, oh my god

3374
06:49:13,660 --> 06:49:17,580
I thought like I thought we were kind of memeing that mercy is like the pawn one

3375
06:49:17,980 --> 06:49:20,540
No, mercy is the pawn one

3376
06:49:21,020 --> 06:49:26,140
Like it was the most it was the funniest short I've ever seen in ages. I absolutely adore it. So don't be afraid to like

3377
06:49:26,940 --> 06:49:33,020
I think if you click subscriptions, you can like scroll down like two and then it shows like shorts of who you're subscribed to

3378
06:49:33,100 --> 06:49:36,940
So don't be afraid to like look at whatever the girls are like posting if you've subscribed to us all

3379
06:49:37,340 --> 06:49:41,500
Which I know you have subscribed to us all haven't you?

3380
06:49:42,620 --> 06:49:44,620
Yes, good

3381
06:49:45,580 --> 06:49:51,580
Let's see if you want to get 99 crafting at some point the typical trading method is minus 30 million

3382
06:49:51,660 --> 06:49:53,660
I wonder what the time is in crafting up

3383
06:49:54,140 --> 06:50:00,860
I'm getting addicted a little bit to runescape, but not as addicted to balochro balochro. Uh, yes. Yes. Good. That's all I'd hear

3384
06:50:01,340 --> 06:50:02,940
I demand

3385
06:50:02,940 --> 06:50:04,940
unification, okay

3386
06:50:05,180 --> 06:50:08,460
That's funny. Like bro the pawn levels are so high upside down now

3387
06:50:08,620 --> 06:50:13,740
Literally a yandere that doesn't know how to night hold a knife properly is the funniest story

3388
06:50:13,820 --> 06:50:15,820
I think I've ever fucking heard in my life

3389
06:50:16,060 --> 06:50:22,140
Um, and it was edited so well like that editor like was above and beyond he does fantastic. Um

3390
06:50:23,420 --> 06:50:27,580
40 hours. Oh shit. How much is cooking? How many hours have I put into cooking?

3391
06:50:27,980 --> 06:50:31,580
Well, the first stream didn't count because I was getting distracted mucking about with you

3392
06:50:31,980 --> 06:50:35,580
We were doing questing so the first runescape stream doesn't actually count

3393
06:50:36,540 --> 06:50:37,740
Um

3394
06:50:37,740 --> 06:50:41,260
I wasn't able to clip yesterday stream. No, no, no, don't worry. Don't worry if you can't do it

3395
06:50:41,260 --> 06:50:47,260
But like for any like literally for anyone who goes back and is like, oh that moment made me blow air out of my nose

3396
06:50:47,260 --> 06:50:53,820
A little bit faster. Hmm. It helps out so much. It really does. Uh, azer gave me a bunch as well. I am gonna

3397
06:50:55,420 --> 06:51:00,700
Um, see if I can get some going for sheebie. I was having problems with sheebie shorts. Um,

3398
06:51:01,260 --> 06:51:05,820
I think I mentioned this the other day. She's so boobalicious that um

3399
06:51:06,700 --> 06:51:12,940
YouTube basically limited pretty much everything which sucked. Um

3400
06:51:13,740 --> 06:51:18,300
I couldn't put advertise like you can put youtube ads to like make her

3401
06:51:19,020 --> 06:51:23,260
Like their shorts show up in the algorithm more, but because she'd be so boobalicious

3402
06:51:23,260 --> 06:51:29,980
I wasn't having it. Although Azura's it let through and I'm like, I think we can all agree. Azura's got bigger oranges than

3403
06:51:30,540 --> 06:51:34,700
Sheepsters, so I'm not really sure how they determine it one minute

3404
06:51:34,700 --> 06:51:38,300
They're discriminating against Azura the next minute. They're like, ah, that's fine

3405
06:51:38,940 --> 06:51:42,380
Cookin's 30 hours. Why am I taking so long then honestly?

3406
06:51:43,980 --> 06:51:48,380
I find I tend to clip a lot more when watching vods. Yes, especially

3407
06:51:48,380 --> 06:51:54,140
Thank you to any vod watchers that like go back and clip or timestamp like funny moments as well

3408
06:51:54,220 --> 06:52:01,020
I am able to see that on my end. Um, but I have asked the girls to take on that responsibility because uh

3409
06:52:01,580 --> 06:52:05,420
If you didn't know most VTuber agencies don't

3410
06:52:05,980 --> 06:52:11,100
Actually create like thumbnails or they tell their girls to like make shorts

3411
06:52:11,660 --> 06:52:16,460
Themselves or out of pocket and I'm like no if you guys just give me the clip

3412
06:52:16,540 --> 06:52:20,300
I'll send it off to a clipper and pay for that and then I'll pay for promotion as well like

3413
06:52:20,940 --> 06:52:22,220
um

3414
06:52:22,220 --> 06:52:27,980
It's quite outrageous what some of these VTuber agencies ask of their talent in my opinion

3415
06:52:28,060 --> 06:52:31,980
But and that's just how it is. So hopefully over time things can change like, um

3416
06:52:33,180 --> 06:52:38,780
Sock VTuber agency looks like it's going to be different, which I'm very happy and excited about um

3417
06:52:39,820 --> 06:52:41,420
I

3418
06:52:41,420 --> 06:52:42,540
um

3419
06:52:42,540 --> 06:52:47,660
I'm very happy to see the rise of new agencies and learn the behind the scenes. Um

3420
06:52:48,380 --> 06:52:53,260
Obviously, we've been incredibly friendly with the yumi plus girls and the behind the scenes

3421
06:52:53,260 --> 06:52:55,740
I got to learn a bit more about them and I am

3422
06:52:56,300 --> 06:53:01,900
Uh, very happy with the direction they're going. So I'm happy to obviously muck about with them. Um

3423
06:53:02,860 --> 06:53:10,540
And hopefully the girls find prosperity under prosperity prosperity prosperity not prosperity

3424
06:53:10,620 --> 06:53:16,860
I think that's a different word. Uh prosperity, uh, pros the good one the good one live long and prosper that one

3425
06:53:17,580 --> 06:53:24,380
I yes live long and prosper for the girls and um, I'm very excited for what the future holds for yumi plus. Um

3426
06:53:25,020 --> 06:53:29,740
I do genuinely think these kinds of VTuber agencies, uh

3427
06:53:30,700 --> 06:53:32,380
definitely

3428
06:53:32,380 --> 06:53:33,980
more of a

3429
06:53:33,980 --> 06:53:35,180
What's

3430
06:53:35,180 --> 06:53:39,660
More of a more and poor vibe. I think is very nice

3431
06:53:40,300 --> 06:53:46,060
Is posterity boobs or something? I don't know as there has more but there's more ropes on yeah

3432
06:53:46,860 --> 06:53:49,500
I mean it pays for itself investment is visibility

3433
06:53:50,300 --> 06:53:51,500
Um

3434
06:53:51,500 --> 06:53:57,980
Yes, and no the reason I say no is because the books haven't been done for the first month of peeler yet

3435
06:53:58,300 --> 06:54:04,780
And I don't know if I've I've spent like way much in like advertising watch along. There's a few hidden things as well

3436
06:54:04,780 --> 06:54:06,140
That was paid for

3437
06:54:06,140 --> 06:54:11,180
Um, the shorts are being paid for so I need to do I need the books to be done

3438
06:54:11,260 --> 06:54:13,820
I don't do the books because obviously I'm number dyslexic

3439
06:54:14,220 --> 06:54:19,900
Um, I'm waiting on the bookkeeper to do their part once the first of july rolls around

3440
06:54:20,300 --> 06:54:23,580
And then I'll be able to see what the agency earned

3441
06:54:24,300 --> 06:54:31,580
And then that means I can maybe talk about my donathon goals. We're a bit far away. We're still

3442
06:54:32,220 --> 06:54:36,620
We're still not even clear. We're you know, october's my donathon

3443
06:54:36,620 --> 06:54:42,140
But as I said, my donathon is related to the agency. It's not related for myself

3444
06:54:42,460 --> 06:54:51,740
Whereas the girls donathons are related to potentially moving out or doing more content or having the availability to do certain things. Um

3445
06:54:53,900 --> 06:54:57,820
Posterior is your rear. Wait put posterior

3446
06:54:58,540 --> 06:55:00,380
Why is that?

3447
06:55:00,380 --> 06:55:01,900
Why is that?

3448
06:55:01,900 --> 06:55:05,340
Oh, we're also gonna have to watch monty python at one point

3449
06:55:07,020 --> 06:55:10,060
And before actually we ran out of money collapse. Oh, no, I

3450
06:55:11,020 --> 06:55:14,220
For me personally, um from what I've seen

3451
06:55:15,100 --> 06:55:18,060
No, the company is not running out of money. Uh

3452
06:55:19,020 --> 06:55:20,460
I

3453
06:55:20,460 --> 06:55:27,020
When it comes to ROI, which is return on investment. Uh, yeah, let's just say I'm no worries

3454
06:55:28,140 --> 06:55:31,980

3458
06:55:49,180 --> 06:55:50,700

And we hopefully have some very exciting news soon to him. Uh

3460
06:55:54,700 --> 06:55:59,180
Posterior meaning behind posterity meaning past. Well, I got it completely wrong

3461
06:55:59,260 --> 06:56:05,820
Yes, we're gonna watch the life of brian because you freaking fanies keep taunting me with fondle of bism

3462
06:56:06,380 --> 06:56:10,700
And it's like, is there something wrong with the way I say

3463
06:56:11,500 --> 06:56:13,500

3464
06:56:14,860 --> 06:56:17,820

Basically is how that's gonna go. Um, so you guys are so done when we watch that together. Um, absolutely done

3468
06:56:30,300 --> 06:56:33,820
Um, because Lucas is fondle of bism

3469
06:56:33,820 --> 06:56:39,100
Look, it was a good name. It wasn't a bad name. I actually like the name

3470
06:56:40,220 --> 06:56:43,180
I don't know. Maybe I'll I'll get her to have a halloween outfit

3471
06:56:43,740 --> 06:56:47,500
um, and then like she has a tag on her head that says fondle of bism

3472
06:56:48,620 --> 06:56:50,220
and

3473
06:56:50,220 --> 06:56:53,340
Just as long as we don't watch the holy grail. Wait, what's wrong with the holy grail?

3474
06:56:53,980 --> 06:56:55,980
Have I seen that? I think I've seen

3475
06:56:56,860 --> 06:56:58,540

3479
06:57:17,340 --> 06:57:19,340
Barring absolute death. Okay

06:57:20,140 --> 06:57:26,220
Holy grail is fine. Is it not huge tracks of land mods kill this roofling. Wait. Oh, no, what happened?

3481
06:57:26,860 --> 06:57:28,860

3487
06:57:50,060 --> 06:57:52,460
Remember that time I clipped mercy not whistling

3488
06:57:53,020 --> 06:57:59,020
Remember that time I'm getting a short produced of mercy of being unable to whistle

3489

3490
06:58:05,180 --> 06:58:07,180

06:58:55,660 --> 06:59:00,620

06:59:59,740 --> 07:00:03,900
I was like, bro, I could probably do better myself. Oh my god. That's so rude though. I'm sorry

3519
07:00:04,140 --> 07:00:06,140

3734
07:31:54,460 --> 07:31:56,460
Oh

3735
07:32:00,700 --> 07:32:02,700
That was a very unique

3736
07:32:12,380 --> 07:32:14,380
Uh

3737
07:32:17,100 --> 07:32:22,220
Honestly means fuck if I'm gonna die I want a nice bowl of chicken ramen in this belly

3738
07:32:24,780 --> 07:32:26,780

3739
07:32:28,540 --> 07:32:35,580
Anyone remember when they the first movie was really realistic when I was not me you win some you lose some

3740
07:32:41,980 --> 07:32:43,980
Oh my god

3741
07:32:45,820 --> 07:32:47,820
Bro bro bro

3742
07:32:54,860 --> 07:32:59,500
This this our arrows are Pearson

3743
07:33:07,340 --> 07:33:09,340
Oh, it's Hennessy in the noodles

3744
07:33:17,420 --> 07:33:19,420
Is that a blowdar

3745
07:33:24,700 --> 07:33:26,700
You

3746
07:33:36,220 --> 07:33:41,820
Can I say something really controversial and it's not very nice

3747
07:33:46,380 --> 07:33:53,180
I really hope this enemy is defeated quickly because the gimmick is pretty bad

3748
07:33:55,180 --> 07:33:58,700
I know that's not nice, but that gimmick is a bit too strong

3749
07:34:00,140 --> 07:34:02,140
I hope he perishes quickly

3750
07:34:03,340 --> 07:34:05,580
I swear if he makes it through the three hours

3751
07:34:07,820 --> 07:34:09,820
Like I get it don't get me wrong

3752
07:34:13,100 --> 07:34:14,300
But

3753
07:34:14,300 --> 07:34:21,580
You don't like the idea of a blind man killing everyone. Yeah, and like being able to sense arrows going past. Yeah, I have dead in it

3754
07:34:21,820 --> 07:34:23,820
I really enjoyed

3755
07:34:25,820 --> 07:34:28,380
The other concepts they put forward, but this is a bit

3756
07:34:31,020 --> 07:34:35,900
Like the old sensey thing she hates the school of blind fury. Wait, is that a movie or something?

3757
07:34:36,780 --> 07:34:38,780
Bro, he's literally using the force

3758
07:34:40,460 --> 07:34:43,580
Okay, I like the ding dong aid assists, but

3759
07:34:43,900 --> 07:34:51,580
If you're gonna tell me there's a fight between him and John Wick like come on

3760
07:35:08,220 --> 07:35:10,540
He's a Jedi in another life honestly

3761
07:35:14,140 --> 07:35:16,140
No, he's just tough. Okay

3762
07:35:18,940 --> 07:35:21,740
You see his toes out if he's tough

3763
07:35:28,540 --> 07:35:31,420
Ouch stuntman, I hope you got paid well for that

3764
07:35:36,780 --> 07:35:40,780
Stranny hates blind people. No, I do not hate blind people

3765
07:35:41,740 --> 07:35:43,740
I think you're doing awesome

3766
07:35:47,740 --> 07:35:49,660
Did you know that um

3767
07:35:49,660 --> 07:35:53,260
blindness like it to get uh diagnosed with blindness and

3768
07:35:53,900 --> 07:36:00,460
Over 50% of like the blindness diagnosis still have some vision. It's not like straight up like see nothing blindness

3769
07:36:00,540 --> 07:36:03,500
like a lot of those who are diagnosed with it still have some sort of like

3770
07:36:03,980 --> 07:36:05,660
light

3771
07:36:05,660 --> 07:36:07,660
perspective and

3772
07:36:07,660 --> 07:36:09,260
and

3773
07:36:09,340 --> 07:36:14,780
Extreme prescription that kind of thing. It's not necessarily like straight up knee nothing going on at all

3774
07:36:15,980 --> 07:36:17,980
So yeah, just thought you should know

3775
07:36:18,860 --> 07:36:20,860
There's also degenerative um

3776
07:36:22,300 --> 07:36:25,900
Ones where you're born with sight but over time you become blind as you go on

3777
07:36:28,620 --> 07:36:34,380
Wait mommy japan discovered guns. Sorry. I'm getting I'm getting too much into facts about the population and stuff

3778
07:36:39,420 --> 07:36:41,420

Hard to hypnotize someone when they're blind. Damn you got me. She's ice-claiming this man. Oh, no

3783
07:37:22,620 --> 07:37:24,620
Wait, they're gonna kill her

3784
07:37:28,300 --> 07:37:32,380
It was it was just a major organ. It's fine

3785
07:37:39,660 --> 07:37:41,660
Yes

3786
07:37:56,780 --> 07:37:58,780
As you will it

3787
07:38:10,060 --> 07:38:12,060
Oh

3788
07:38:17,740 --> 07:38:21,020
Sue wait is this also mean like

3789
07:38:21,660 --> 07:38:26,780
Because obviously that game's called also like do your best or am I being an idiot?

3790
07:38:27,660 --> 07:38:29,660
No gambates do your best

3791
07:38:39,580 --> 07:38:41,580
I

3792
07:38:42,060 --> 07:38:51,020
Like how the enemy design have only masks for this region as well as like another nod to the culture and to appreciate it

3793
07:39:05,740 --> 07:39:07,740
Gambate

3794
07:39:09,260 --> 07:39:11,260
You

3795
07:39:11,260 --> 07:39:13,260
You

3796
07:39:13,260 --> 07:39:15,260
You

3797
07:39:37,980 --> 07:39:41,980
Num I twat myself on num chucks. I just know that for a fact

3798
07:39:44,140 --> 07:39:46,140
You

3799
07:39:53,020 --> 07:39:55,020
The armor is amazing on the enemies

3800
07:40:07,660 --> 07:40:09,660
I think you've gotten

3801
07:40:13,260 --> 07:40:16,220
You

3802
07:40:44,220 --> 07:40:46,220
You

3803
07:40:54,460 --> 07:40:58,780
Wait, what day is it for America is it Saturday or Friday right now for America?

3804
07:41:08,060 --> 07:41:13,180
Friday, okay good. Sorry. Okay tomorrow the highlights for debut. Okay

3805
07:41:13,260 --> 07:41:16,620
Thank you. Thank you. I was like, oh wait a minute

3806
07:41:16,620 --> 07:41:21,180
Wasn't I supposed to have the highlights for debut coming out on Saturday?

3807
07:41:21,180 --> 07:41:24,220
And I was like, uh, what day is it for you guys? Smile

3808
07:41:27,820 --> 07:41:30,540
Okay, okay tomorrow the highlights of debut come out

3809
07:41:32,380 --> 07:41:37,420
On everyone's channel. I will do that when I wake up after my sleep

3810
07:41:43,660 --> 07:41:45,660
You

3811
07:41:57,900 --> 07:42:00,940
Don't do the fancy whipping around it's not that hard to not get hit

3812
07:42:01,340 --> 07:42:03,900
I don't know. I feel like I'd be like that with a whip as well

3813
07:42:03,980 --> 07:42:06,780
Like those kind of weapons that can horribly backfire

3814
07:42:07,020 --> 07:42:11,740
I'd probably have like the worst scar on my face after whipping the crap out of myself

3815
07:42:12,700 --> 07:42:14,700
And because whip scars don't heal

3816
07:42:35,900 --> 07:42:39,180
Just a simple swinging trapping it under your arm against

3817
07:42:39,820 --> 07:42:42,300
Requires a high dexterity score

3818
07:42:43,340 --> 07:42:47,740
I have like the only thing I have going for me is luck

3819
07:42:49,180 --> 07:42:54,540
And endurance these are the only two attributes if you had to like make a player card of me

3820
07:42:55,180 --> 07:43:00,380
Luck and endurance is the only two things and it has gotten me so far. I have zero perspective

3821
07:43:00,700 --> 07:43:06,540
Um, like I have no idea what's going on around me. No not perspective. What's the perception? That's it

3822
07:43:07,020 --> 07:43:12,460
I have no idea what's going on around me. I've not now charisma possibly got some points in charisma

3823
07:43:13,420 --> 07:43:15,420
and

3824
07:43:15,820 --> 07:43:17,820
Oh

3825
07:43:18,220 --> 07:43:21,660
Oh, please tell me this face done in like three sayings. Come on

3826
07:43:36,540 --> 07:43:38,540
You

3827
07:44:06,540 --> 07:44:08,540
You

3828
07:44:27,340 --> 07:44:29,500
Wrap it up wrap it up come on

3829
07:44:31,500 --> 07:44:34,540
I've dead man. I'm not feeling this. I'm not feeling this section

3830
07:44:37,500 --> 07:44:39,500
A gunfight with a blind guy really

3831
07:44:44,380 --> 07:44:49,020
In my solitude wrap it up like let's go to the next one

3832
07:44:53,900 --> 07:44:55,900
He does what to the gun

3833
07:44:56,460 --> 07:45:00,460
If you don't have subtitles on it says caulk's gun and it's spelt that way

3834
07:45:01,580 --> 07:45:03,580
So that was a terrible joke

3835
07:45:06,540 --> 07:45:08,540
I

3836
07:45:08,780 --> 07:45:14,780
Literally just beat him by throwing something a little to the right and then one pop and game, you know gg

3837
07:45:15,900 --> 07:45:17,900
Come on

3838
07:45:18,540 --> 07:45:21,180
Stop talking you're giving away your eco location

3839
07:45:22,380 --> 07:45:26,460
Oh, I'm I'm gonna start spanking the dirt is script writers for this one. I have to admit

3840
07:45:27,500 --> 07:45:33,420
Man cling clang and on fucking stuff in the room and you're like, oh gee. I wonder where he is cling clang cling clang

3841
07:45:37,420 --> 07:45:39,420
Oh, okay nice one John

3842
07:45:52,780 --> 07:45:54,780
I wish Johnny would caulk my gun

3843
07:45:59,260 --> 07:46:02,540
I'm gonna play that fucking ps4 horror game where you don't breathe

3844
07:46:06,540 --> 07:46:08,540
You

3845
07:46:36,860 --> 07:46:38,860
You

3846
07:46:49,740 --> 07:46:51,740
Hey

3847
07:46:52,700 --> 07:46:54,700
Friend or fool

3848
07:46:56,060 --> 07:46:58,060
What

3849
07:47:06,540 --> 07:47:08,540
You

3850
07:47:10,060 --> 07:47:12,060
Friend or fool what

3851
07:47:21,100 --> 07:47:23,100
Neither

3852
07:47:36,700 --> 07:47:38,700
You

3853
07:47:46,860 --> 07:47:48,860
20 million

3854
07:47:51,580 --> 07:47:53,580
That was a lot of money

3855
07:48:06,540 --> 07:48:08,540
I

3856
07:48:15,900 --> 07:48:19,660
I'm starting to understand why this movie is three hours long. I think we've legit had no

3857
07:48:21,900 --> 07:48:26,300
Fucking plot for like the last 30 minutes it's all been fighting

3858
07:48:28,940 --> 07:48:30,940
Hey

3859
07:48:32,140 --> 07:48:35,020
Hi friend, please

3860
07:48:36,700 --> 07:48:38,700
You

3861
07:48:44,060 --> 07:48:46,060
What are you a fan

3862
07:48:47,900 --> 07:48:50,400
Please don't set the dog on me. I'd appreciate that

3863
07:49:06,540 --> 07:49:15,660
I was talking about the cowboys though

3864
07:49:20,940 --> 07:49:27,260
What he just wants the bounty until it's bigger and then he can disappear

3865
07:49:33,980 --> 07:49:35,980
Yeah, damn

3866
07:49:36,860 --> 07:49:38,860
It's honey

3867
07:49:40,620 --> 07:49:47,020
So the bounty keeps growing. Oh, I want them to live

3868
07:49:55,500 --> 07:49:57,500
Please let them live

3869
07:49:59,260 --> 07:50:01,260
No

3870
07:50:01,660 --> 07:50:07,180
Modes eliminate this blind man

3871
07:50:24,860 --> 07:50:27,900
Oh, no, no, no, come on

3872
07:50:28,300 --> 07:50:31,980
He's gonna die right in front of his freaking daughter

3873
07:50:34,300 --> 07:50:36,300
Oh

3874
07:50:39,020 --> 07:50:42,220
How did they make these action films so sad

3875
07:50:51,420 --> 07:50:53,420
Modes take this man's dry row away

3876
07:50:54,380 --> 07:50:57,900
Actually about one person probably understood that reference

3877
07:51:00,140 --> 07:51:05,660
Dry row is the disability paycheck you get if you're legally like disabled or the the doctor

3878
07:51:06,300 --> 07:51:09,260
Deems you unfit for work. So that was a very poor joke, but

3879
07:51:11,820 --> 07:51:17,260
I just want this guy gone. I don't like the plot surrounding him. I don't I'm sorry. I said it

3880
07:51:18,220 --> 07:51:20,300
Please John Wick pop out of the water and just

3881
07:51:21,100 --> 07:51:23,100
And let it be done

3882
07:51:24,220 --> 07:51:26,220
Oh

3883
07:51:32,060 --> 07:51:34,060
Just let them win

3884
07:51:42,780 --> 07:51:49,740
Like one old man, you're totally gonna win this there's your chance this old man is winning the stank fight

3885
07:51:53,420 --> 07:51:55,420
You

3886
07:52:23,980 --> 07:52:25,980
You

3887
07:52:34,140 --> 07:52:36,140
All right, I was most stomach as you heard that

3888
07:52:54,140 --> 07:52:56,140
What

3889
07:53:01,340 --> 07:53:03,340
Is he not bleeding out

3890
07:53:07,100 --> 07:53:09,100
What I don't understand

3891
07:53:15,020 --> 07:53:17,020
Wait so he could have survived the injuries

3892
07:53:17,260 --> 07:53:23,980
And he was gonna leave the daughter alone

3893
07:53:35,660 --> 07:53:39,900
I'm not even crying from upset. I am getting frustrated now

3894
07:53:43,820 --> 07:53:45,820
Uh

3895
07:53:45,900 --> 07:53:50,860
Can we can can we get timestamp when blind man die dies

3896
07:54:04,060 --> 07:54:09,180
I'm gonna say the script rewires are definitely different in this bloody movie because the

3897
07:54:10,540 --> 07:54:13,740
The vibe and the change is

3898
07:54:16,780 --> 07:54:18,780
So

3899
07:54:27,180 --> 07:54:31,260
Well, it seems like she's gonna get him at least later date

3900
07:54:38,620 --> 07:54:39,820
Wrap it up

3901
07:54:40,460 --> 07:54:42,380
I'm not spoiling it

3902
07:54:42,380 --> 07:54:48,060
That last indication and the shot made it seem like she will be the reason the man perishes at least

3903
07:54:48,620 --> 07:54:55,020
So my i'm allowed to predict or is that really annoying if the person predicts a street like the how the movie's gonna go

3904
07:54:56,220 --> 07:54:59,020
I'm uh, yes to predictions or no to predictions

3905
07:54:59,980 --> 07:55:01,980
You

3906
07:55:07,740 --> 07:55:09,740
Can always predict okay, just don't answer

3907
07:55:10,300 --> 07:55:13,260
Because of that last shot being like i'll be waiting for you

3908
07:55:14,300 --> 07:55:20,540
What's gonna happen is wait, wait, wait, they're actually becoming a jewel stop. I guess that the star

3909
07:55:21,260 --> 07:55:23,260
I

3910
07:55:25,020 --> 07:55:30,140
Was gonna say she'll slip in just as he's about to lose the fight and perish the blind man

3911
07:55:34,860 --> 07:55:36,860
Kane

3912
07:55:37,020 --> 07:55:39,020
Oh

3913
07:55:49,980 --> 07:55:52,620
This is a very unlikely jewel it's not looking good

3914
07:55:56,060 --> 07:56:00,860
Or I will yeah, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay

3915
07:56:07,820 --> 07:56:09,820
You

3916
07:56:10,220 --> 07:56:12,220
You

3917
07:56:12,220 --> 07:56:14,220
You

3918
07:56:35,500 --> 07:56:40,220
I couldn't even imagine what's recent through her head right now. She literally warned her dad at the start

3919
07:56:40,860 --> 07:56:43,660
Oh, they never got to go on the father door date

3920
07:56:48,860 --> 07:56:50,860
Oh with friends like these moment

3921
07:56:55,820 --> 07:56:58,860
Oh no, they're hosting a funeral for the hotel

3922
07:57:10,220 --> 07:57:12,220
You

3923
07:57:12,220 --> 07:57:14,220
You

3924
07:57:33,100 --> 07:57:36,060
Benevolence I love that word benevolence

3925
07:57:37,820 --> 07:57:39,820
I miss my dad is though

3926
07:57:40,780 --> 07:57:45,740

Periwinkle, okay, we'll give the dog that dog's called periwinkle

3938
07:59:32,140 --> 07:59:34,140

I'm not looking sorry

3949
08:02:08,380 --> 08:02:13,980
I didn't understand. I thought he was gonna put it through the hole for some reason and I was like the knife handles too big

3950
08:02:16,220 --> 08:02:19,180
I didn't I didn't understand. I'm sorry. I'm not looking

3951
08:02:22,780 --> 08:02:24,780

Oh, okay

3953

Wait, that's how the guy became blamed because he made a deal

3954

08:07:55,980 --> 08:07:58,380
I don't think I've ever seen a glitter suit in my life

3983
08:08:20,860 --> 08:08:22,860
Uh

3984
08:08:35,260 --> 08:08:39,340
We either just made an ally or we just made an enemy

3985
08:08:46,220 --> 08:08:48,220
No an enemy, okay

3986
08:08:50,220 --> 08:08:52,220
In me

3987
08:09:03,020 --> 08:09:07,500
Well, we've got ourselves in a little bit of a situation

3988
08:09:12,700 --> 08:09:14,700

We need a bit too long on that one 20 seconds is enough to do it

3997
08:11:50,220 --> 08:11:52,220
You

3998

Right, we've got two doubles

4038
08:18:38,940 --> 08:18:41,180
That's like twit

4039
08:19:09,740 --> 08:19:12,380
He just has very bad vision because of the scars

4040
08:19:16,140 --> 08:19:18,140

08:19:38,940 --> 08:19:40,940

4044
08:20:36,380 --> 08:20:38,380
Um

4045
08:20:38,940 --> 08:20:40,940
You guys want to become allies

4046
08:20:43,180 --> 08:20:45,820
You guys want to become allies for like a second

4047
08:20:47,820 --> 08:20:49,820
What

4048
08:20:57,100 --> 08:20:59,100
Sure

08:21:09,260 --> 08:21:24,220
Okay, hold on a minute, I might have been a little heasty I will admit I'm an absolute follower

08:21:26,780 --> 08:21:28,780
No, I'm not the flashbang

4051
08:21:30,860 --> 08:21:36,860
I actually really like when the enemies become allies hold on they might redeem themselves

4052
08:21:37,580 --> 08:21:43,180
The movie might have redeemed itself if the enemies become allies

4053
08:21:45,580 --> 08:21:47,580
That is the only way

4054
08:21:52,940 --> 08:21:58,700
Well, they party hard in germ- oh wait berlin raves are like known worldwide for how crazy they are

4055
08:22:06,860 --> 08:22:08,860
I

4056
08:22:12,140 --> 08:22:19,660
Possible redemption arc I don't know I genuinely don't know how this movie is gonna swing

4057
08:22:29,660 --> 08:22:31,660
Another rave continuing to go

4058
08:22:37,180 --> 08:22:39,180
Oh

4059
08:22:48,860 --> 08:22:51,980
You're gonna need a little more of that to keep it up

4060
08:22:58,780 --> 08:23:00,780
Spine honed

4061
08:23:07,660 --> 08:23:09,100
Wow

4062
08:23:09,100 --> 08:23:14,540
Oh, come on. He's bled out a bit. He is not feeling good enough to be tossing me around like a rag doll

4063
08:23:15,100 --> 08:23:17,740
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. That's my tie. That's my tie

4064
08:23:20,060 --> 08:23:23,100
Stop it. That's mine not yours

4065
08:23:23,680 --> 08:23:25,680
It's

4066
08:23:35,260 --> 08:23:37,820
No, whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa

4067
08:23:53,100 --> 08:24:05,920
What?

4068
08:24:05,920 --> 08:24:12,440
Wow on air.

4069
08:24:12,440 --> 08:24:20,820
You okay?

4070
08:24:20,820 --> 08:24:48,260
Oh my god, that was me to a riflin, I may jump on you, wait is that an appropriate,

4071
08:24:48,260 --> 08:24:50,060
can we do that convention?

4072
08:25:18,260 --> 08:25:25,820
Like I know they said barrel and raves are crazy, but I think this is a bit more than I expected, I think we'll be honest.

4073
08:25:25,820 --> 08:25:29,580
Stunny gets arrested for jumping on a riflin in public.

4074
08:25:29,580 --> 08:25:36,700
Well you gonna press charges? You gonna press charges because I pressed against you huh?

4075
08:25:48,260 --> 08:26:00,180
Let's try and end your program.

4076
08:26:18,260 --> 08:26:30,660
God this guy has so much HP damage. Infinite health bar.

4077
08:26:48,260 --> 08:26:55,460
So what's the deal?

4078
08:27:18,260 --> 08:27:30,660
Bruh, meh, meh. Feels like we're going against Goliath here.

4079
08:27:48,260 --> 08:27:50,260
Then I leave you in the hands of fate.

4080
08:28:09,260 --> 08:28:14,260
What? Oh proof, proof of death.

4081
08:28:19,260 --> 08:28:24,260
So what about our two non-alloy allies?

4082
08:28:40,260 --> 08:28:44,260
There's far too much clothes being worn for an actual barrel and rave.

4083
08:28:44,260 --> 08:28:48,260
That's all I'm gonna say, I have seen the outfits that come from these raves.

4084
08:28:52,260 --> 08:28:54,260
No, no, no.

4085
08:28:55,260 --> 08:28:57,260
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4086
08:28:59,260 --> 08:29:01,260
I forgot to say.

4087
08:29:15,260 --> 08:29:18,260
Hmm?

4088
08:29:20,260 --> 08:29:22,260
What?

4089
08:29:22,260 --> 08:29:24,260
What?

4090
08:29:38,260 --> 08:29:40,260
Bonjour.

4091
08:29:40,260 --> 08:29:45,260
Pour-tu, Madame? Pour toi, désolé pour toi, Madame.

4092
08:29:52,260 --> 08:29:54,260
Pour toi.

4093
08:30:22,260 --> 08:30:34,260
Oh, 92 just popped, let's go.

4094
08:30:36,260 --> 08:30:42,260
Yay, 92. Did they just get married? Something like that.

4095
08:30:45,260 --> 08:30:48,260
Don't try this at home folks, no definitely not.

4096
08:30:48,260 --> 08:30:50,260
Level 92.

4097
08:30:53,260 --> 08:31:00,260
You're challenged.

4098
08:31:08,260 --> 08:31:14,260
Winston is gonna be your nominee.

4099
08:31:15,260 --> 08:31:20,260
Don't remind me, Emmy.

4100
08:31:23,260 --> 08:31:28,260
I mean, we're at 33,000 jugs, honestly we're getting there.

4101
08:31:28,260 --> 08:31:35,260
We really got 45,000 or something at the start, like we're gonna be in the 20s I think.

4102
08:31:38,260 --> 08:31:40,260
You're welcome, LeMau.

4103
08:31:41,260 --> 08:31:44,260
And game, Emmy.

4104
08:31:46,260 --> 08:31:48,260
It's not the real Emmy.

4105
08:31:53,260 --> 08:31:56,260
You're peeing as my daughter, are you?

4106
08:32:03,260 --> 08:32:05,260
Hmm.

4107
08:32:11,260 --> 08:32:13,260
Hmm.

4108
08:32:17,260 --> 08:32:21,260
You're coping with a two week vacation.

4109
08:32:21,260 --> 08:32:23,260
Hmm.

4110
08:32:41,260 --> 08:32:45,260
Exactly, we have to deal with it.

4111
08:32:52,260 --> 08:32:54,260
Hmm.

4112
08:33:04,260 --> 08:33:06,260
Lance, who's Lance?

4113
08:33:08,260 --> 08:33:10,260
Winston is Lance?

4114
08:33:12,260 --> 08:33:14,260
Or Concierge is Lance?

4115
08:33:21,260 --> 08:33:33,260
Oh, yeah, yeah, Concierge is. Sorry.

4116
08:33:51,260 --> 08:33:53,260
Hmm.

4117
08:34:01,260 --> 08:34:03,260
Hmm.

4118
08:34:03,260 --> 08:34:05,260
Hmm.

4119
08:34:17,260 --> 08:34:20,260
They're fun to the bosoms, right?

4120
08:34:33,260 --> 08:34:35,260
Hmm.

4121
08:34:54,260 --> 08:34:57,260
There it is, one man do it.

4122
08:35:03,260 --> 08:35:05,260
Hmm.

4123
08:35:16,260 --> 08:35:18,260
What?

4124
08:35:18,260 --> 08:35:20,260
Hmm.

4125
08:35:32,260 --> 08:35:36,260
I'll take my odds with Baba Yaga, I'm gonna be honest.

4126
08:35:40,260 --> 08:35:42,260
Hmm.

4127
08:35:43,260 --> 08:35:46,260
Winston is happy with the terms.

4128
08:35:49,260 --> 08:35:51,260
Hmm.

4129
08:35:53,260 --> 08:35:57,260
Important, Meaton, Ethel Turd in the background.

4130
08:35:58,260 --> 08:36:01,260
I'll take those odds, yeah, I'm with you there.

4131
08:36:07,260 --> 08:36:09,260
Nice and fresh.

4132
08:36:10,260 --> 08:36:13,260
And I'm with the Triple Lusky.

4133
08:36:14,260 --> 08:36:16,260
Hmm.

4134
08:36:17,260 --> 08:36:23,260
Wait, it's a card, wait, Winston the Jewel, I thought it meant of combat, hold on a minute.

4135
08:36:29,260 --> 08:36:32,260
It's a game of chance of chords?

4136
08:36:33,260 --> 08:36:38,260
I thought it was physical combat, that's why I picked Baba Yaga.

4137
08:36:43,260 --> 08:36:45,260
Hmm.

4138
08:37:04,260 --> 08:37:06,260
What?

4139
08:37:13,260 --> 08:37:25,260
Oh, they're picking and whoever has the highest number gets their choice.

4140
08:37:25,260 --> 08:37:27,260
So is it combat?

4141
08:37:37,260 --> 08:37:39,260
Blades.

4142
08:37:44,260 --> 08:37:46,260
Pistolate.

4143
08:37:47,260 --> 08:37:49,260
Ooh.

4144
08:38:04,260 --> 08:38:07,260
Right, just paw of greed.

4145
08:38:08,260 --> 08:38:14,260
Oh, cause you never change right, we get it, fourth installment.

4146
08:38:14,260 --> 08:38:19,260
Ray, we get it, wrap it up, wrap it up, we get it, John Wick never changes, wrap it up.

4147
08:38:19,260 --> 08:38:22,260
This is a fourth film in a row.

4148
08:38:22,260 --> 08:38:24,260
Wrap it up.

4149
08:38:24,260 --> 08:38:26,260
Ah.

4150
08:38:35,260 --> 08:38:37,260
Four, why never changes?

4151
08:38:47,260 --> 08:38:49,260
No quarter.

4152
08:38:54,260 --> 08:38:56,260
Cain.

4153
08:39:04,260 --> 08:39:06,260
Okay.

4154
08:39:09,260 --> 08:39:12,260
I guess we aren't on an ally streak.

4155
08:39:24,260 --> 08:39:26,260
Okay.

4156
08:39:54,260 --> 08:39:56,260
Okay.

4157
08:40:25,260 --> 08:40:27,260
Yes.

4158
08:40:36,260 --> 08:40:40,260
He just wants to play Hotel Simulator, leave him be.

4159
08:40:55,260 --> 08:41:00,260
Not like this.

4160
08:41:11,260 --> 08:41:21,260
Unless, unless last minute we kill him, I don't know.

4161
08:41:25,260 --> 08:41:30,260
In life last minute we kill him, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

4162
08:41:32,260 --> 08:41:34,260
Oh, I don't know.

4163
08:41:34,260 --> 08:41:37,260
I don't know how this film's gonna end.

4164
08:41:37,260 --> 08:41:43,260
I originally thought we were literally going around the high table, getting all seven and going for it.

4165
08:41:43,260 --> 08:41:46,260
But obviously that's not how you're supposed to do it.

4166
08:41:46,260 --> 08:41:47,260
Pardon me.

4167
08:41:47,260 --> 08:41:49,260
He wants to revive Havel Hotel.

4168
08:41:49,260 --> 08:41:52,260
Apparently they came out with Old Havel Hotel.

4169
08:41:52,260 --> 08:41:55,260
And everyone was like, yeah, you see it groomed on that website?

4170
08:41:55,260 --> 08:41:59,260
Which is actually shot on, to be honest.

4171
08:42:10,260 --> 08:42:14,260
Lighting a candle for our wife, Helen.

4172
08:42:19,260 --> 08:42:21,260
Okay.

4173
08:42:49,260 --> 08:42:51,260
Um.

4174
08:43:00,260 --> 08:43:02,260
Kill's closed.

4175
08:43:19,260 --> 08:43:21,260
No.

4176
08:43:49,260 --> 08:43:51,260
Okay.

4177
08:43:51,260 --> 08:43:53,260
Okay.

4178
08:44:15,260 --> 08:44:18,260
I urge you to reconsider.

4179
08:44:21,260 --> 08:44:23,260
Yeah.

4180
08:44:34,260 --> 08:44:36,260
I miss you too, buddy.

4181
08:44:42,260 --> 08:44:44,260
Goodbye, King.

4182
08:44:52,260 --> 08:44:58,260
Uh, level 92.

4183
08:45:00,260 --> 08:45:06,260
We're getting almost to 20,000 left over grapes and wine, so we're getting there.

4184
08:45:21,260 --> 08:45:23,260
Okay.

4185
08:45:46,260 --> 08:45:49,260
He says such ominous stuff.

4186
08:45:49,260 --> 08:45:53,260
It's almost like that old man's not written for him, even though...

4187
08:46:03,260 --> 08:46:05,260
Bonsoir.

4188
08:46:05,260 --> 08:46:07,260
Salut. Bonsoir.

4189
08:46:07,260 --> 08:46:09,260
Bonsoir.

4190
08:46:17,260 --> 08:46:19,260
Merci.

4191
08:46:19,260 --> 08:46:21,260
Merci. Bonsoir.

4192
08:46:25,260 --> 08:46:27,260
Excuse-moi.

4193
08:46:27,260 --> 08:46:31,260
Where is the man?

4194
08:46:32,260 --> 08:46:35,260
That's how he does bro.

4195
08:46:35,260 --> 08:46:40,260
Honestly, I feel like that old guy doesn't actually like the new kid.

4196
08:46:40,260 --> 08:46:43,260
Like he wants the old ways.

4197
08:46:43,260 --> 08:46:45,260
Bonsoir.

4198
08:47:03,260 --> 08:47:05,260
Bonsoir.

4199
08:47:07,260 --> 08:47:09,260
Salut.

4200
08:47:14,260 --> 08:47:16,260
Salut.

4201
08:47:29,260 --> 08:47:31,260
Where is he?

4202
08:47:44,260 --> 08:47:47,260
Uh, any devours?

4203
08:47:47,260 --> 08:47:49,260
Nope.

4204
08:47:49,260 --> 08:47:52,260
He's got the glares- whoa, what's this?

4205
08:47:54,260 --> 08:47:56,260
The math of the city?

4206
08:48:13,260 --> 08:48:25,260
Uh, uh, he's wrong about that.

4207
08:48:31,260 --> 08:48:38,260
Okay, maybe the blind man has more cars, but John Wick wants to kill so he can keep the memory of his wife, okay?

4208
08:48:38,260 --> 08:48:41,260
So you're not correct, technically.

4209
08:48:41,260 --> 08:48:43,260
Stinky Frenchman.

4210
08:48:43,260 --> 08:48:45,260
P.E.U., go take a bath.

4211
08:48:45,260 --> 08:48:47,260
You know?

4212
08:48:47,260 --> 08:48:53,260
Put some odour toilet on, mate. You're absolutely giving me the book.

4213
08:48:53,260 --> 08:48:59,260
Are we having a battle on the Eiffel Tower? On the big Eiffel Tower?

4214
08:48:59,260 --> 08:49:02,260
Oh, inside the tower?

4215
08:49:02,260 --> 08:49:05,260
Seek and destroy?

4216
08:49:05,260 --> 08:49:07,260
Oh.

4217
08:49:11,260 --> 08:49:15,260
We are making the high table sweat, holy crap.

4218
08:49:41,260 --> 08:49:45,260
Hired for Gen 2 confirmed.

4219
08:50:12,260 --> 08:50:14,260
P.E.U., go take a bath.

4220
08:50:14,260 --> 08:50:40,660
That's called Psychological Warfare.

4221
08:50:40,660 --> 08:51:06,260
Incinerate Armour?

4222
08:51:06,260 --> 08:51:34,180
The movie's thrown me, I can't predict what's going to happen, it's all going to be over

4223
08:51:34,180 --> 08:52:04,020
in an hour, then we're going to know.

4224
08:52:04,740 --> 08:52:26,820
Fiberoptic internet on that thing, that thing does not hold 21 bills, I can tell you that

4225
08:52:27,140 --> 08:52:43,300
right now, how few words does he actually say in this plot, he's using a heartbeat sensor, cheater,

4226
08:52:43,300 --> 08:52:49,860
cheater, cheater, pumpkin ear, no we're taking a romantic stroll on the river, sea, was it

4227
08:52:50,580 --> 08:52:55,460
sea air, sorry sea air, that's the accent on,

4228
08:52:58,660 --> 08:53:01,300
I was a bit late for that, oh

4229
08:53:12,100 --> 08:53:13,300
Mr. Concierge

4230
08:53:20,820 --> 08:53:26,820
mm

4231
08:53:43,140 --> 08:53:45,940
white right

4232
08:53:49,860 --> 08:53:56,860
Good bye and good luck, Mr. Wick.

4233
08:53:56,860 --> 08:54:03,860
Mon chance.

4234
08:54:03,860 --> 08:54:14,860
No miss you.

4235
08:54:14,860 --> 08:54:28,860
I'm not going to cry.

4236
08:54:28,860 --> 08:54:29,860
Too frustrated.

4237
08:54:29,860 --> 08:54:30,860
I'm not going to cry.

4238
08:54:30,860 --> 08:54:32,860
Because I have no idea where this film is going.

4239
08:54:32,860 --> 08:54:34,860
But I'm not going to cry.

4240
08:54:34,860 --> 08:54:47,860
That was very sweet.

4241
08:54:47,860 --> 08:55:10,860
No no, no cry, no cry.

4242
08:55:10,860 --> 08:55:18,860
Wait, so how are they allowed to still go from even though he has a fight with a high table?

4243
08:55:18,860 --> 08:55:47,860
All fades are black.

4244
08:55:47,860 --> 08:56:12,860
I'm not going to cry.

4245
08:56:12,860 --> 08:56:39,860
I'm not going to cry.

4246
08:56:39,860 --> 08:57:04,860
I'm not going to cry.

4247
08:57:04,860 --> 08:57:06,860
I'm level 96 now, strongy.

4248
08:57:06,860 --> 08:57:12,860
Give me your account right now.

4249
08:57:12,860 --> 08:57:23,860
Just a few more levels.

4250
08:57:23,860 --> 08:57:27,860
Oh, they're actually thinking about shutting down the traffic because it's so bad here.

4251
08:57:27,860 --> 08:57:29,860
Yes, mummy, here's my account.

4252
08:57:29,860 --> 08:57:33,860
Stop.

4253
08:57:33,860 --> 08:57:39,860
Oh my god, they wanted to shut it down because the John Wick's driving.

4254
08:57:39,860 --> 08:57:40,860
What's that mean?

4255
08:57:40,860 --> 08:57:51,860
I had a drink of cola.

4256
08:57:51,860 --> 08:57:52,860
Wait, nice noise.

4257
08:57:52,860 --> 08:57:55,860
What?

4258
08:57:55,860 --> 08:57:59,860
Is my camp young?

4259
08:57:59,860 --> 08:58:01,860
Did I fart and not mute?

4260
08:58:01,860 --> 08:58:02,860
Hold on, what noise?

4261
08:58:02,860 --> 08:58:03,860
You're making me nervous.

4262
08:58:03,860 --> 08:58:09,860
Did I fart and not mute?

4263
08:58:09,860 --> 08:58:11,860
You made a funny snorty noise.

4264
08:58:11,860 --> 08:58:14,860
Did I fart?

4265
08:58:14,860 --> 08:58:16,860
Oh my god.

4266
08:58:16,860 --> 08:58:22,860
I did drink of cola.

4267
08:58:22,860 --> 08:58:24,860
You made a funny noise?

4268
08:58:24,860 --> 08:58:25,860
I don't even remember.

4269
08:58:25,860 --> 08:58:26,860
I drank cola.

4270
08:58:26,860 --> 08:58:29,860
Maybe it got stuck on the way down.

4271
08:58:29,860 --> 08:58:31,860
It wasn't a breath.

4272
08:58:31,860 --> 08:58:33,860
Close, close no cigar.

4273
08:58:33,860 --> 08:58:35,860
I didn't even know what noise I made.

4274
08:58:55,860 --> 08:59:16,860
If you've seen it and you've seen it and you know you want to go to Tokyo.

4275
08:59:16,860 --> 08:59:31,860
I can't.

4276
08:59:31,860 --> 08:59:38,860
Well, we're actually getting praised in real time.

4277
08:59:38,860 --> 08:59:59,860
Me, mommy, me, I'm the big winner.

4278
08:59:59,860 --> 09:00:25,860
Is this Skrillex?

4279
09:00:25,860 --> 09:00:29,860
And maybe my stomach making a noise because I've not eaten since the past though.

4280
09:00:29,860 --> 09:00:35,860
But I'm not really that hungry.

4281
09:00:35,860 --> 09:01:04,860
My spine.

4282
09:01:04,860 --> 09:01:32,860
My stomach.

4283
09:01:33,860 --> 09:01:42,860
Are you okay, sir?

4284
09:01:42,860 --> 09:01:43,860
Oh, then again, they have guns.

4285
09:01:43,860 --> 09:01:49,860
I wouldn't get out of the car if someone's got guns and I ran somewhere and saws.

4286
09:01:49,860 --> 09:02:01,860
Can't stop, won't stop.

4287
09:02:01,860 --> 09:02:14,860
Friend or foe, question mark.

4288
09:02:14,860 --> 09:02:16,860
I don't, I don't get the angle.

4289
09:02:16,860 --> 09:02:19,860
I think he's going to turn into a friend.

4290
09:02:19,860 --> 09:02:46,860
Because they don't pay him and he's pissed at his hand.

4291
09:02:46,860 --> 09:02:51,860
You know the classic Citroen car, I've forgotten the name of it.

4292
09:02:51,860 --> 09:03:00,860
Oh, it might have been my feet on the seat.

4293
09:03:00,860 --> 09:03:07,860
He wants the bounty so he's going to keep him alive.

4294
09:03:08,860 --> 09:03:12,860
There's a French saying, I actually forgot the word.

4295
09:03:12,860 --> 09:03:20,860
Is it bullion? No, bullion soup.

4296
09:03:20,860 --> 09:03:23,860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4297
09:03:23,860 --> 09:03:24,860
Okay, yeah, yeah, that's right.

4298
09:03:24,860 --> 09:03:25,860
Walk off, walk off.

4299
09:03:25,860 --> 09:03:27,860
Walk off, you're fine, you're fine.

4300
09:03:27,860 --> 09:03:30,860
God, these movies cannot get away from like harm and animals.

4301
09:03:30,860 --> 09:03:31,860
Like relax.

4302
09:03:31,860 --> 09:03:34,860
I don't know who wrote the scripts, but y'all need to calm down.

4303
09:03:34,860 --> 09:03:58,860
So someone needs their like hard drive check for like some weirds going on at John Wick headquarters.

4304
09:03:58,860 --> 09:04:01,860
That dog literally build different for real.

4305
09:04:01,860 --> 09:04:02,860
It's a cyborg.

4306
09:04:02,860 --> 09:04:20,860
And that's why it's fine.

4307
09:04:20,860 --> 09:04:21,860
Oh, I like that.

4308
09:04:21,860 --> 09:04:22,860
That was unique.

4309
09:04:50,860 --> 09:05:07,860
Dude, you just shot that guy in the dick, dude.

4310
09:05:07,860 --> 09:05:09,860
Dude, what's wrong?

4311
09:05:09,860 --> 09:05:17,860
You just shot that guy in the dick.

4312
09:05:17,860 --> 09:05:19,860
What the fuck?

4313
09:05:19,860 --> 09:05:20,860
What the fuck?

4314
09:05:20,860 --> 09:05:21,860
What the fuck?

4315
09:05:21,860 --> 09:05:22,860

4316
09:05:22,860 --> 09:05:23,860

What the fuck?

4318
09:05:24,860 --> 09:05:25,860
What the fuck?

4319
09:05:25,860 --> 09:05:26,860
What the fuck?

4320
09:05:26,860 --> 09:05:27,860
What the fuck?

4321
09:05:27,860 --> 09:05:28,860
What the fuck?

4322
09:05:28,860 --> 09:05:56,860
What the fuck?

4323
09:05:56,860 --> 09:05:57,860
Hey, Kigtmin.

4324
09:05:57,860 --> 09:05:58,860

Oh, what's the deal?

4327
09:06:03,860 --> 09:06:14,860
Yeah, that was before you stabbed me in the hand weirdo.

4328
09:06:14,860 --> 09:06:29,340
Oh, it's backpack spiller proof!

4329
09:06:29,340 --> 09:06:32,540
Ehh!

4330
09:06:32,540 --> 09:06:39,660
Okay, that was cool.

4331
09:06:40,620 --> 09:06:44,620
Ehh!

4332
09:06:44,620 --> 09:06:48,620
Oh my god, it's about to background.

4333
09:06:48,620 --> 09:06:54,620
God, I have so much brain roll with that game right now.

4334
09:06:54,620 --> 09:07:02,620
Qua.

4335
09:07:03,580 --> 09:07:09,580
Daco.

4336
09:07:09,580 --> 09:07:17,580
Okay, so now he's not friend blue.

4337
09:07:18,540 --> 09:07:34,540
I love how he now has to use a wireless old timey phone, literally.

4338
09:07:34,540 --> 09:07:42,540
Oh, how else would they make the servant get their money's worth out of the servants?

4339
09:07:42,540 --> 09:07:58,540
BOO! Incider amul!

4340
09:08:02,540 --> 09:08:06,540
Wuuohhh!

4341
09:08:06,540 --> 09:08:14,540
Oh my god visually that's insane but I guess it highlights the pellet spread

4342
09:08:14,540 --> 09:08:17,540
against the shotgun.

4343
09:08:23,540 --> 09:08:29,540
I'm liking this like perspective as well.

4344
09:08:31,540 --> 09:08:35,540
This definitely feels different.

4345
09:08:36,540 --> 09:08:54,540
You know what, uh, Hotline Miami.

4346
09:08:59,540 --> 09:09:02,540
Hotline Miami, that's why.

4347
09:09:06,540 --> 09:09:22,540
Even the soundtrack, hold on a minute, did they just kinda go Hotline Miami this soon?

4348
09:09:31,540 --> 09:09:34,540
Right, no fall.

4365
09:10:50,880 --> 09:10:52,880

The Doug's not hostile anymore.

4393
09:12:14,880 --> 09:12:42,540
I

4394
09:12:42,540 --> 09:12:48,780
like the almost commentary of a foxy they actually says oh clap trap would be crying

4395
09:12:53,580 --> 09:12:54,140
still playing

4396
09:12:54,140 --> 09:13:08,860
oh he's so so oh now hold on a minute part wait

4397
09:13:24,140 --> 09:13:46,620
I don't know if this is a woman moment but we've been we've been at this for a

4398
09:13:46,620 --> 09:13:50,780
bit we get it can we get to the location to do the plot we're kind of

4399
09:13:51,180 --> 09:13:58,540
quest continuously right now so our last side quest unlocked a secret ally that was

4400
09:13:58,540 --> 09:14:04,300
originally wanting to get us okay I understand but can we you know get to the location I get it

4401
09:14:04,300 --> 09:14:10,780
we're under attack but come on I was still got another half an hour that's fine because the

4402
09:14:10,780 --> 09:14:19,900
plot I guess is gonna pick up but yeah damn I don't know if it's a woman moment but

4403
09:14:20,860 --> 09:14:26,220
you know you gotta get me something to bite into other than pew pew I will admit the hotline

4404
09:14:26,220 --> 09:14:43,580
Miami scene was good because they did something very different but now don't get me wrong I

4405
09:14:43,580 --> 09:14:47,500
understand it's explaining that he's such an unstoppable force

4406
09:14:52,300 --> 09:14:52,540
but

4407
09:14:55,660 --> 09:14:59,500
and the henchmen ain't gonna perish themselves I know but I'm like come on

4408
09:15:01,660 --> 09:15:05,820
if you're gonna be like oh he's under a timer let's not do a billion side quest then huh

4409
09:15:05,820 --> 09:15:12,060
oh

4410
09:15:35,820 --> 09:15:38,820
Uuughh.

4411
09:15:59,820 --> 09:16:02,820
Killing my patience as well.

4412
09:16:02,820 --> 09:16:06,820
Like, I do get the emphasis that he's like such a bad un-

4413
09:16:06,820 --> 09:16:09,820
like, you just kinda kill him type thing.

4414
09:16:10,820 --> 09:16:14,820
Please, get into that. Just teleport there at this point.

4415
09:16:14,820 --> 09:16:19,820
Just no clip through the damn walls and stuff at this point. Please.

4416
09:16:19,820 --> 09:16:23,820
I am on my knees. Give me a bit more plot. Give me a bit more of a plot.

4417
09:16:23,820 --> 09:16:25,820
Go on, give me a plot. Yeah-

4418
09:16:25,820 --> 09:16:29,820
Aaaaaaah! Please! Yeah!

4419
09:16:29,820 --> 09:16:31,820
Awww.

4420
09:16:33,820 --> 09:16:34,820
Oh, for-

4421
09:16:38,820 --> 09:16:42,820
I am sure this is supposed to be a humorous gag, but...

4422
09:16:59,820 --> 09:17:06,820
I get it's supposed to be a humorous gag. It would be humorous if the scenes weren't-

4423
09:17:06,820 --> 09:17:10,820
had- the combat hadn't gone on for like a solid 40 minutes.

4424
09:17:10,820 --> 09:17:13,820
Oh, and of course he doesn't make it in time. What a surprise.

4425
09:17:13,820 --> 09:17:16,820
So they cheated.

4426
09:17:16,820 --> 09:17:22,100
weren't had the combat hadn't gone on for like a solid 40 minutes oh and of

4427
09:17:22,100 --> 09:17:25,540
course he doesn't make it in time what's prize

4428
09:17:32,940 --> 09:17:36,060
so they cheated

4429
09:17:36,420 --> 09:17:48,740
wait Kane isn't there either it's up but Kane

4430
09:17:52,060 --> 09:17:57,780
wait they're both lay on he's lay on purpose or something

4431
09:18:07,060 --> 09:18:15,780
yes mr. Kane thank you mr. Kane

4432
09:18:22,700 --> 09:18:28,620
that stunt double I hope he got paid his weight in gold for that staircase scene

4433
09:18:28,620 --> 09:18:33,580
because those are like so dangerous and especially with the outfit that John

4434
09:18:33,580 --> 09:18:39,180
Wick is assigned he's so skinny Malinky in such an outfit that the padding the

4435
09:18:39,180 --> 09:18:43,620
stunt double receives has to be

4436
09:19:04,580 --> 09:19:10,540
I am so confused where this movie is going

4437
09:19:12,620 --> 09:19:18,660
like aren't they about to fight each other in literally two minutes time

4438
09:19:18,660 --> 09:19:35,060
mmm co-op mode literally they've just swapped from single-player to co-op

4439
09:19:39,140 --> 09:19:44,620
and they're very odd friends indeed

4440
09:19:48,720 --> 09:19:50,720
I

4441
09:19:56,600 --> 09:19:58,600
off

4442
09:19:58,600 --> 09:20:21,640
Kiana raced at all his own stuns?

4443
09:20:21,640 --> 09:20:22,640
Is he crazy?

4444
09:20:22,640 --> 09:20:29,640
Oh for fuck's sake the poker table allies are all coming together.

4445
09:20:29,640 --> 09:20:38,640
The dog's judging him, the dog said come on he saved me.

4446
09:20:38,640 --> 09:20:56,640
I'm not, but he can.

4447
09:20:57,640 --> 09:21:24,640
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4448
09:21:24,640 --> 09:21:31,640
I wondered why they focused.

4449
09:21:31,640 --> 09:21:38,640
Hi Popper.

4450
09:21:38,640 --> 09:21:41,640
You're one of them aren't ya?

4451
09:21:41,640 --> 09:22:10,640
I thought it was a girl puppy.

4452
09:22:10,640 --> 09:22:15,640
Oh did he just work me?

4453
09:22:15,640 --> 09:22:16,640
You mind?

4454
09:22:16,640 --> 09:22:20,640
How long it took me to get here?

4455
09:22:20,640 --> 09:22:25,640
That hurt.

4456
09:22:25,640 --> 09:22:28,640
That was my shooting hand.

4457
09:22:28,640 --> 09:22:41,640
You imagine a random tourist walking past being like drunk as shit, what, seeing this?

4458
09:22:41,640 --> 09:22:49,640
Peeler, the Peeler dog honestly.

4459
09:22:49,640 --> 09:23:02,640
We made it somehow, every just little.

4460
09:23:02,640 --> 09:23:04,640
Aw.

4461
09:23:32,640 --> 09:23:53,640
Ha, no way, consequences.

4462
09:23:53,640 --> 09:24:14,640
Hey, I like that billet detail.

4463
09:24:14,640 --> 09:24:24,640
More billets coming off of them.

4464
09:24:24,640 --> 09:24:29,640
I thought it was a girl cause she went oh good girl like way earlier.

4465
09:24:29,640 --> 09:24:33,640
Or she, maybe I just made that up.

4466
09:24:33,640 --> 09:24:35,640
Me, I'm the dog all along.

4467
09:25:03,640 --> 09:25:06,640
You

4468
09:25:33,640 --> 09:25:35,640
You

4469
09:26:03,640 --> 09:26:05,640
You

4470
09:26:33,640 --> 09:26:35,640
You

4471
09:26:47,640 --> 09:26:52,640
Everyone hates the high table.

4472
09:26:52,640 --> 09:26:59,640
What if we agreed to shoot each other in the shoulder and no one dies?

4473
09:26:59,640 --> 09:27:09,640
Wait what if we can't just ever do this shit?

4474
09:27:09,640 --> 09:27:21,640
Can we can't just ever do this like really quick?

4475
09:27:21,640 --> 09:27:23,640
Wait how many, we only have two billets.

4476
09:27:23,640 --> 09:27:24,640
How many guards?

4477
09:27:24,640 --> 09:27:26,640
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

4478
09:27:26,640 --> 09:27:38,640
I have hope and then nine for the bad guy cause the old man doesn't want this.

4479
09:27:38,640 --> 09:27:46,640
No, he missed on purpose.

4480
09:27:46,640 --> 09:27:54,640
They both missed on purpose.

4481
09:27:54,640 --> 09:28:00,640
Fuck.

4482
09:28:00,640 --> 09:28:06,640
Okay, give us another cheeky billet then.

4483
09:28:06,640 --> 09:28:09,640
Cause you only gave us one.

4484
09:28:09,640 --> 09:28:14,640
Thank you.

4485
09:28:14,640 --> 09:28:16,640
Please, Katniss, everything this.

4486
09:28:16,640 --> 09:28:33,640
I'm gonna go fucking way older so you can't, Katniss, everything this.

4487
09:28:33,640 --> 09:28:35,640
One, nine.

4488
09:28:45,640 --> 09:28:52,640
No.

4489
09:29:06,640 --> 09:29:10,640
Come on, King.

4490
09:29:10,640 --> 09:29:22,640
No, he can't walk steady.

4491
09:29:22,640 --> 09:29:29,640
Your enemy is my enemy.

4492
09:29:29,640 --> 09:29:31,640
Your enemy is my enemy.

4493
09:29:31,640 --> 09:29:44,640
Come on.

4494
09:29:44,640 --> 09:29:46,640
And who is him?

4495
09:29:46,640 --> 09:29:48,640
Come on, who is him?

4496
09:29:59,640 --> 09:30:17,640
Come on.

4497
09:30:17,640 --> 09:30:19,640
Oh man, please.

4498
09:30:47,640 --> 09:31:13,640
Come on.

4499
09:31:13,640 --> 09:31:15,640
They're finishing me with the final moves.

4500
09:31:15,640 --> 09:31:44,640
Oh, come on.

4501
09:31:44,640 --> 09:31:48,640
Anyone.

4502
09:31:48,640 --> 09:31:57,640
He never saw.

4503
09:31:57,640 --> 09:32:07,640
Wait, the guards don't care.

4504
09:32:07,640 --> 09:32:27,640
The guards to the elder guy, I guess?

4505
09:32:27,640 --> 09:32:29,640
All he had to do was shoot, I guess?

4506
09:32:29,640 --> 09:32:37,640
That was in the rules of the marathons and...

4507
09:32:37,640 --> 09:32:42,640
Oh.

4508
09:32:42,640 --> 09:32:49,640
A still illegal move?

4509
09:33:13,640 --> 09:33:17,640
Can we get like an ambulance or something?

4510
09:33:17,640 --> 09:33:21,640
You know, should you give it a medical assistance here and there?

4511
09:33:21,640 --> 09:33:27,640
A few gauze if you've got it.

4512
09:33:27,640 --> 09:33:33,640
You know, maybe a pump of O-negative blood if anyone's got O-negative.

4513
09:33:33,640 --> 09:33:36,640
Yeah.

4514
09:34:12,640 --> 09:34:21,640
Again, you persist, Mr. Wick.

4515
09:34:21,640 --> 09:34:36,640
Against all odds.

4516
09:34:36,640 --> 09:34:39,640
Oh.

4517
09:34:39,640 --> 09:34:43,640
He doesn't think he's gonna make it.

4518
09:34:43,640 --> 09:34:47,640
Spoilers, there's a five in production, thank god.

4519
09:34:47,640 --> 09:34:50,640
Oh wait, no, sorry, he just means like actually take me to New York.

4520
09:34:50,640 --> 09:34:53,640
Sorry, sorry, forgot what country they're in.

4521
09:34:53,640 --> 09:34:55,640
Hold on a minute, they're in France.

4522
09:34:55,640 --> 09:34:59,640
Hold on a minute, didn't think that one through.

4523
09:34:59,640 --> 09:35:01,640
Wait.

4524
09:35:01,640 --> 09:35:02,640
Oh no, he does think he's dying.

4525
09:35:02,640 --> 09:35:07,640
Hold on, I spoke too soon, but thankfully there is John Wick 5 in production.

4526
09:35:07,640 --> 09:35:12,640
Okay, my apologies, not only did I ruin that, reversed it, then did it twice.

4527
09:35:12,640 --> 09:35:16,640
Okay, I take it back, there's a John Wick 5 coming.

4528
09:35:16,640 --> 09:35:19,640
But he thinks he's dying, but he can't.

4529
09:35:19,640 --> 09:35:22,640
There's a John Wick 5.

4530
09:35:22,640 --> 09:35:28,640
And if you're telling me that Osaka chick is John Wick 5, no, no, no, no.

4531
09:35:28,640 --> 09:35:29,640
Not at all.

4532
09:35:29,640 --> 09:35:30,640
Not at all.

4533
09:35:30,640 --> 09:35:31,640
Not at all.

4534
09:35:31,640 --> 09:35:32,640
Not at all.

4535
09:35:32,640 --> 09:35:33,640
Not at all.

4536
09:35:33,640 --> 09:35:34,640
Not at all.

4537
09:35:34,640 --> 09:35:35,640
Not at all.

4538
09:35:35,640 --> 09:35:36,640
Not at all.

4539
09:35:36,640 --> 09:35:37,640
Not at all.

4540
09:35:37,640 --> 09:35:38,640
Not at all.

4541
09:35:38,640 --> 09:35:39,640
Not at all.

4542
09:35:39,640 --> 09:35:40,640
Not at all.

4543
09:35:40,640 --> 09:35:41,640
Not at all.

4544
09:35:41,640 --> 09:35:42,640
Not at all.

4545
09:35:42,640 --> 09:35:43,640
Not at all.

4546
09:35:43,640 --> 09:35:44,640
Not at all.

4547
09:35:44,640 --> 09:35:45,640
Not at all.

4548
09:35:45,640 --> 09:35:46,640
Not at all.

4549
09:35:46,640 --> 09:35:47,640
Not at all.

4550
09:35:47,640 --> 09:35:48,640
Not at all.

4551
09:35:48,640 --> 09:35:49,640
Not at all.

4552
09:35:49,640 --> 09:35:50,640
Not at all.

4553
09:35:50,640 --> 09:35:51,640
Not at all.

4554
09:35:51,640 --> 09:35:52,640
Not at all.

4555
09:35:52,640 --> 09:35:53,640
Not at all.

4556
09:35:54,640 --> 09:35:55,640
Not at all.

4557
09:36:08,640 --> 09:36:09,640
Bro, you ain't passing away.

4558
09:36:09,640 --> 09:36:11,640
John Wick 5 is a thing.

4559
09:36:11,640 --> 09:36:14,640
You're not him, bro!

4560
09:36:17,640 --> 09:36:21,640
Absolutely rigged and dirty.

4561
09:36:21,640 --> 09:36:25,640
Thank God you guys spoiled. There's a whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4562
09:36:40,920 --> 09:36:41,920
Question mark.

4563
09:36:45,400 --> 09:36:47,480
For once in my life, question mark.

4564
09:36:51,880 --> 09:36:52,380
Huh?

4565
09:36:54,080 --> 09:36:54,580
Huh?

4566
09:36:57,320 --> 09:37:00,040
Motherfucker, you said there was a five.

4567
09:37:03,560 --> 09:37:04,060
Hello?

4568
09:37:18,800 --> 09:37:20,000
That's fake, right?

4569
09:37:22,240 --> 09:37:22,740
What?

4570
09:37:25,840 --> 09:37:26,340
What?

4571
09:37:29,440 --> 09:37:29,940
Whoa!

4572
09:37:34,840 --> 09:37:36,240
No, he's still alive.

4573
09:37:49,080 --> 09:37:49,580
Whoa!

4574
09:37:51,640 --> 09:38:01,640
No, he's like, hidden behind a tree, right? And he's not really dead.

4575
09:38:03,240 --> 09:38:06,040
You said there was a John Wick five.

4576
09:38:08,540 --> 09:38:11,240
I know he's buried beside his way.

4577
09:38:15,440 --> 09:38:18,240
You told me there was a John Wick five.

4578
09:38:19,240 --> 09:38:21,840
He's like behind a tree, right?

4579
09:38:24,840 --> 09:38:26,840
Is he not behind a tree?

4580
09:38:31,040 --> 09:38:34,840
Wait, whoa! Why would you do that to me?

4581
09:38:34,840 --> 09:38:37,440
There's no, like, after-sync credit.

4582
09:38:39,840 --> 09:38:43,440
There's no evidence that he actually died!

4583
09:38:44,440 --> 09:38:45,440
No!

4584
09:38:45,440 --> 09:38:46,440
Whoa!

4585
09:38:48,840 --> 09:38:49,840
Whoa!

4586
09:38:51,040 --> 09:38:53,440
I'm, like, laughing and crying.

4587
09:38:53,440 --> 09:38:56,440
He actually fucking died!

4588
09:38:58,440 --> 09:38:59,640
He fucking-

4589
09:39:00,840 --> 09:39:02,640
Wait, are you serious?

4590
09:39:04,840 --> 09:39:08,640
Why is he actually dead after all of that?

4591
09:39:10,840 --> 09:39:11,840
Wait, whoa!

4592
09:39:14,640 --> 09:39:17,240
No, he's gone into the credits.

4593
09:39:18,640 --> 09:39:21,440
I don't think there's a posting credit!

4594
09:39:21,440 --> 09:39:22,840
Is he dead?

4595
09:39:25,440 --> 09:39:26,840
Is he actually dead?

4596
09:39:27,440 --> 09:39:30,440
Oh, wait, there's a posting credit! What the fuck are you doing? Stop!

4597
09:39:30,440 --> 09:39:31,840
Skip to the end!

4598
09:39:31,840 --> 09:39:34,640
Skip to the end! There's a posting credit!

4599
09:39:35,440 --> 09:39:39,040
I'm gonna throw up! I'm gonna throw up!

4600
09:39:39,040 --> 09:39:40,440
There's a posting-

4601
09:39:40,440 --> 09:39:41,040
Wait, go-

4602
09:39:42,840 --> 09:39:44,040
Go to the end!

4603
09:39:45,840 --> 09:39:46,840
Stop!

4604
09:39:48,440 --> 09:39:53,240
No, I don't think Sol is in the fact that he can see his daughter again!

4605
09:39:53,840 --> 09:39:55,240
No!

4606
09:39:57,240 --> 09:39:58,240
Stop!

4607
09:39:59,840 --> 09:40:01,640
Why did you kill him?

4608
09:40:06,040 --> 09:40:10,440
No! The fucking Osaka bitch killed him! No!

4609
09:40:11,040 --> 09:40:12,240
Why?

4610
09:40:12,240 --> 09:40:15,240
No, no, no, no, no, no!

4611
09:40:16,240 --> 09:40:19,440
No, no, it makes it so much worse!

4612
09:40:19,440 --> 09:40:21,440
No!

4613
09:40:24,440 --> 09:40:27,440
I can't believe we're in Skip anymore!

4614
09:40:28,840 --> 09:40:31,440
What the fuck is this?

4615
09:40:33,440 --> 09:40:36,440
You told me there was a five!

4616
09:40:36,440 --> 09:40:39,440
I believed you!

4617
09:40:39,440 --> 09:40:43,440
And he doesn't get to see his daughter!

4618
09:40:43,640 --> 09:40:45,640
I'm fucking distraught!

4619
09:40:45,640 --> 09:40:48,640
How am I supposed to make way?

4620
09:40:48,640 --> 09:40:50,640
An edge mill!

4621
09:40:52,640 --> 09:40:53,640
Oh my god!

4622
09:40:54,640 --> 09:40:56,640
What the fuck?

4623
09:40:57,640 --> 09:41:01,640
I'm fine, I'm okay, I'm sweating, but what the fuck?

4624
09:41:05,640 --> 09:41:07,640
He actually dies!

4625
09:41:07,640 --> 09:41:10,640
I thought I was being so fucking cocky in this scene!

4626
09:41:10,840 --> 09:41:15,840
He's fine, just get him some O-negative blood, he's fine!

4627
09:41:16,840 --> 09:41:21,840
Oh yeah, just taking me back to New York, I can't be arsed driving the plane myself!

4628
09:41:23,840 --> 09:41:30,840
And then fucking Kane McGee doesn't even get to see his daughter!

4629
09:41:32,840 --> 09:41:35,840
Who the fuck wrote that script?

4630
09:41:36,840 --> 09:41:40,840
What a horrible person you are to lay waste to that!

4631
09:41:40,840 --> 09:41:43,840
Why would you create something like that?

4632
09:41:45,840 --> 09:41:47,840
Why?

4633
09:41:47,840 --> 09:41:50,840
Why can't we have happy endings?

4634
09:41:50,840 --> 09:41:54,840
Is it too much to ask for happy endings?

4635
09:41:57,840 --> 09:41:59,840
Do we know what's in John Wick 5?

4636
09:41:59,840 --> 09:42:06,840
Please tell me they fucking cloned him, and he's the first human clone, and he's still him.

4637
09:42:06,840 --> 09:42:09,840
And they clone his wife, and then they go on dates and stuff.

4638
09:42:09,840 --> 09:42:16,840
I would just watch that to be honest, they catch up and do the work and stuff together.

4639
09:42:18,840 --> 09:42:21,840
Nothing is known about fire, okay?

4640
09:42:22,840 --> 09:42:24,840
Is that a prequel?

4641
09:42:24,840 --> 09:42:27,840
I'm fucking cheating, hold on, I'm looking up the prequel.

4642
09:42:27,840 --> 09:42:31,840
I'm looking up on ID, NBM, Elemental P or whatever the fuck it is.

4643
09:42:36,840 --> 09:42:39,840
Oh my god, what one is it? What one's the game?

4644
09:42:40,840 --> 09:42:42,840
I don't know, hold on.

4645
09:42:42,840 --> 09:42:46,840
It's like a fucking browser source or something.

4646
09:42:47,840 --> 09:42:49,840
Oh, I'm gonna be sick!

4647
09:42:49,840 --> 09:42:58,840
I don't know, is John Wick in the fucking ID Elemental P website where it's like, oh this is who this actor is in this?

4648
09:43:01,840 --> 09:43:05,840
They are thinking about how to revive him, they fucking better.

4649
09:43:05,840 --> 09:43:08,840
Sorry, they better put a defibrillator on his corpse and dig it up and shit.

4650
09:43:08,840 --> 09:43:13,840
But tell me he's behind a tree right now, and they just had to do that for sure.

4651
09:43:15,840 --> 09:43:17,840
He actually dies.

4652
09:43:18,840 --> 09:43:20,840
Why the fuck did we watch that?

4653
09:43:20,840 --> 09:43:24,840
Why did I put that on? I thought he was, he can't be killed.

4654
09:43:26,840 --> 09:43:38,840
Keep in mind we just saw him collapse, he was like, well, I don't know, considering the gravestone said what he wanted the gravestone to say, like, saw us, but I'm a doubter.

4655
09:43:42,840 --> 09:43:43,840
I'm a doubter.

4656
09:43:44,840 --> 09:43:46,840
He actually dies, what the fuck.

4657
09:43:48,840 --> 09:43:52,840
He's not behind a tree, he's actually in a farm. That makes no sense.

4658
09:43:54,840 --> 09:43:57,840
The ending just teases what happens with Cain.

4659
09:43:57,840 --> 09:43:59,840
Oh, I don't care about Cain.

4660
09:43:59,840 --> 09:44:08,840
I mean, I do that he sees his daughter, but I don't have the patience to go through another movie to be like, I finally get to see my daughter.

4661
09:44:12,840 --> 09:44:15,840
They are keeping, yeah.

4662
09:44:18,840 --> 09:44:21,840
And he gets to be with his wife and Daisy.

4663
09:44:23,840 --> 09:44:28,840
I was being so fucking cocky because she told me there was a five that he couldn't die.

4664
09:44:28,840 --> 09:44:33,840
I was like, yeah, no, he can just take all the damage because it's fine, he's coming up in five.

4665
09:44:36,840 --> 09:44:38,840
Oh my god.

4666
09:44:40,840 --> 09:44:42,840
All I do is cry.

4667
09:44:43,840 --> 09:44:55,840
All I do is cry, these are supposed to be action pu pu movies, and I put them on because I'm like, oh, it's gonna be like Transformers, all cool and stuff, yeah, let's do that, they're so cool, yeah, action movies.

4668
09:44:59,840 --> 09:45:06,840
They can't even call it John Wick 5 without Big Johnny Boy being there, so he is hiding behind a tree like a fanny, honestly.

4669
09:45:07,840 --> 09:45:12,840
Literally, he's away grinning to himself being like, they got a wee gravestone of me.

4670
09:45:14,840 --> 09:45:18,840
He's actually just raising an army, clearly.

4671
09:45:19,840 --> 09:45:21,840
Can we watch Cool Family?

4672
09:45:21,840 --> 09:45:25,840
Yeah, next time we watch something, it's gonna have to be something easy.

4673
09:45:25,840 --> 09:45:31,840
My body's literally shaking right now because I'm so emotionally distraught after that.

4674
09:45:32,840 --> 09:45:43,840
And before the fifth one's a prequel, I think it's probably gonna be because, yeah, I don't see why he would be hiding behind a tree, Avengers style.

4675
09:45:47,840 --> 09:45:49,840
Bring him back like Robocop.

4676
09:45:49,840 --> 09:45:57,840
It could be him after four, it could be a prequel about his tale of how he became, that's probably the...

4677
09:45:58,840 --> 09:46:00,840
Because, yeah.

4678
09:46:01,840 --> 09:46:03,840
Because why would you show a gravestone?

4679
09:46:03,840 --> 09:46:06,840
And it literally had the words on it.

4680
09:46:06,840 --> 09:46:10,840
And fucking Big Winston said goodbye to us and shit.

4681
09:46:12,840 --> 09:46:16,840
Is there John Wick 5 stars and he's sitting on a bench eating a sandwich?

4682
09:46:16,840 --> 09:46:18,840
Literally I'd sit and watch that, so I would.

4683
09:46:19,840 --> 09:46:26,840
John Wick tries to get back into a regular 9-5 and he's working at Starbucks and he can't handle the rush orders.

4684
09:46:26,840 --> 09:46:33,840
And he doesn't understand when someone orders 12 sugar pump how much they're killing themselves with the drink.

4685
09:46:33,840 --> 09:46:41,840
And he gets really mad because every time someone orders a drink, that one drink alone is his one hour wage because of how bad wages are.

4686
09:46:42,840 --> 09:46:44,840
Mm, okay, yeah, I'd watch that.

4687
09:46:44,840 --> 09:46:51,840
Okay, I take solace in the fact that I can see him in a Starbucks apron right now in a little Starbucks hat, repping it with his long hair.

4688
09:46:51,840 --> 09:46:53,840
Mm, yeah, okay.

4689
09:46:53,840 --> 09:46:55,840
Copium, copium.

4690
09:46:55,840 --> 09:46:57,840
Counterpoint Palpatine.

4691
09:46:57,840 --> 09:47:02,840
That was rubbish in Star Wars, well, am I right?

4692
09:47:02,840 --> 09:47:07,840
Um, I'm gonna need a big old sleep after that one.

4693
09:47:07,840 --> 09:47:09,840
Oh, no, that's wine.

4694
09:47:09,840 --> 09:47:11,840
Oh my god.

4695
09:47:13,840 --> 09:47:17,840
I can't believe that, why would anyone write that?

4696
09:47:17,840 --> 09:47:19,840
Why would anyone do that?

4697
09:47:20,840 --> 09:47:31,840
Is the IBDM or whatever that website up for John Wick 5, if it is, can you say if the female Helen is in it?

4698
09:47:31,840 --> 09:47:38,840
If the female Helen is proven to be in the cast, we know it's a prequel because she isn't supposed to move.

4699
09:47:38,840 --> 09:47:43,840
She doesn't move in the picture, so she doesn't get credit for being Helen.

4700
09:47:43,840 --> 09:47:50,840
It's, here is 6am, how am I supposed to sleep?

4701
09:47:50,840 --> 09:47:54,840
They could do a cop out and have it be someone else's funeral.

4702
09:47:54,840 --> 09:47:57,840
But why, what would that do?

4703
09:47:57,840 --> 09:48:07,840
That's the worst point, is that he got completely pardoned and could go back to the life, well, he had in quotation marks.

4704
09:48:09,840 --> 09:48:15,840
But that was the whole point, he had just achieved that life and then he perished right after it.

4705
09:48:17,840 --> 09:48:19,840
Bro, what?

4706
09:48:20,840 --> 09:48:27,840
Bro, I'm going to have to play Belchow tomorrow to cheer me up, because what the fuck?

4707
09:48:27,840 --> 09:48:35,840
There's no official cast list yet, man, I hate that website, elementopimbdm.com or whatever it is.

4708
09:48:35,840 --> 09:48:41,840
It doesn't say anything about the plot or the actors.

4709
09:48:41,840 --> 09:48:48,840
The Continental is a series about Winston from 2023, any chance we're going to watch that?

4710
09:48:49,840 --> 09:48:54,840
Is this after 4? Like, the Continental has been restored?

4711
09:48:54,840 --> 09:49:01,840
Every time I say Continental, I think of Ice Age Continental Drift, I don't even think I've watched it, but yeah.

4712
09:49:01,840 --> 09:49:05,840
And we need some Gamber to cheer up my brain again.

4713
09:49:05,840 --> 09:49:07,840
I didn't realise he...

4714
09:49:07,840 --> 09:49:19,840
I think 5 is a prequel because it was so successful that they want to milk it for more pennies, which is fine, because it goes to Keanu Reeves and I'll eat him, so...

4715
09:49:22,840 --> 09:49:30,840
Next movie is called Ballerina with Keanu Reeves, sorry, I can't speak, but he's not the main character.

4716
09:49:30,840 --> 09:49:32,840
Nah, it's from before.

4717
09:49:38,840 --> 09:49:43,840
I'm gonna need some emotional break after that, I was not prepared for that.

4718
09:49:43,840 --> 09:49:48,840
Oh sorry, there's a bird literally hanging out right outside my window, oh my god.

4719
09:49:49,840 --> 09:49:51,840
I was so freaking cocky!

4720
09:49:52,840 --> 09:49:54,840
I was like so cocky.

4721
09:49:55,840 --> 09:49:58,840
Sorry, my voice is going...

4722
09:50:01,840 --> 09:50:03,840
I've got a wee bit of game audio in the background for you.

4723
09:50:13,840 --> 09:50:22,840
I had a feeling you'd have this reaction and none of you has warned me, you'll let me fall into the sensibility of main character can't die because...

4724
09:50:23,840 --> 09:50:33,840
Because there's a fifth movie coming out, no, I'm literally sweating, I'm gonna have to get a shower before I go to bed, I'm sweating that much from my emotional distraught.

4725
09:50:34,840 --> 09:50:36,840
Unbelievable.

4726
09:50:36,840 --> 09:50:43,840
No, spoiler, sorry, no, thank you for not spoiling it, but at the same time, Reflins!

4727
09:50:43,840 --> 09:50:47,840
Why did you not warn me how unbelievably sad John Wick is?

4728
09:50:47,840 --> 09:50:51,840
I don't even remember the first one being so sad.

4729
09:50:52,840 --> 09:50:58,840
Fucking, I'm such a cry baby, I literally just proven I'm like the cry baby out of all of us at VLOG.

4730
09:51:00,840 --> 09:51:03,840
I hadn't seen any of them, I never expected, is it gonna be so emotional?

4731
09:51:03,840 --> 09:51:05,840
Fucking, look at that!

4732
09:51:05,840 --> 09:51:06,840
Pew pew!

4733
09:51:06,840 --> 09:51:08,840
Transformers!

4734
09:51:08,840 --> 09:51:10,840
Like, oh so fun, let's go!

4735
09:51:10,840 --> 09:51:14,840
And then I've got Iron Man next, thank god, I don't have to watch that.

4736
09:51:15,840 --> 09:51:24,840
We're not watching anything further than Iron Man because I cry my eyes out at freaking, how you call it as well, like Marvel series.

4737
09:51:24,840 --> 09:51:27,840
Maybe Avengers assemble, I quite like that.

4738
09:51:27,840 --> 09:51:29,840
Are you squiddin' me right now?

4739
09:51:30,840 --> 09:51:32,840
To be fair, you said no spoilers.

4740
09:51:33,840 --> 09:51:37,840
I know Brian, and Broly Legend, thank you for the tip.

4741
09:51:37,840 --> 09:51:42,840
I know I said no spoilers and thank you for respecting it, but at the same time, oh my god,

4742
09:51:42,840 --> 09:51:51,840
I was watching that being so, pardon me, being so cocky, like mm, mm, yeah, yeah, there's a John Wick 5, yeah, yeah, yeah, right, wrap it up, wrap it up.

4743
09:51:52,840 --> 09:51:58,840
But then it didn't, like as it progressed, it didn't make any sense because he literally got pardoned by the guy.

4744
09:52:01,840 --> 09:52:03,840
And just...

4745
09:52:04,840 --> 09:52:05,840
Ugh.

4746
09:52:08,840 --> 09:52:09,840
Ugh.

4747
09:52:13,840 --> 09:52:18,840
I knew the first one was intensely sad, but I didn't expect that.

4748
09:52:18,840 --> 09:52:22,840
And I always thought John Wick was just a pew-pew, literally a bamboozled.

4749
09:52:22,840 --> 09:52:24,840
Would you have liked it if we had actually spoiled it?

4750
09:52:24,840 --> 09:52:30,840
No, if you spoiled it, it wouldn't have been the same if I knew what was coming up.

4751
09:52:31,840 --> 09:52:38,840
Like, literally as he walked down the flipping church, I was like, ah, he's fine, he's fine.

4752
09:52:38,840 --> 09:52:46,840
And then the scene fades and it says gravestone and I'm like, uh, what?

4753
09:52:47,840 --> 09:52:52,840
What? What? What?

4754
09:52:54,840 --> 09:52:56,840
Like, it doesn't make any sense.

4755
09:52:59,840 --> 09:53:04,840
I thank you, thank you impossible, you couldn't die made it even worse, honestly.

4756
09:53:04,840 --> 09:53:11,840
I was like, wait, he's literally, I don't know what, it must be a Marvel film, I'm thinking of.

4757
09:53:11,840 --> 09:53:17,840
There's one where they're all at a gravestone for someone, but they're not actually dead, they're like hiding behind a tree, watching over.

4758
09:53:17,840 --> 09:53:24,840
Which is exactly what I thought, I was like, oh, he's behind a tree, but then the camera didn't do a big wide shot pan.

4759
09:53:24,840 --> 09:53:29,840
I'm like, uh, hold on a minute, hold on a minute.

4760
09:53:30,840 --> 09:53:36,840
Uh, to be fair, it was the first time I watched the movie, okay, you're not being punished.

4761
09:53:37,840 --> 09:53:55,840
Oh my god, sorry, the next few movie choices, bruv, I'm gonna have to pick familiar movies that are like funny or ha ha, because bruv, bruv, I'm distraught, I am distraught, okay?

4762
09:53:56,840 --> 09:54:06,840
Um, so we did good, yes he also did, Hollywood rules, no dead, no body, no death, the whole blind guy stick didn't make any sense.

4763
09:54:06,840 --> 09:54:22,840
I have to admit, I probably would not, um, I would say the first one was my favourite, and then the second one and then the third and then the fourth is, I would, personally I would not rewatch the fourth.

4764
09:54:22,840 --> 09:54:35,840
No, not just because of the emotional turmoil right at the end for me, but because I didn't really, stuff felt so extended and it felt very gimmicky.

4765
09:54:35,840 --> 09:54:44,840
Um, I wish, perhaps, it was not like so, but it was at the end of the day.

4766
09:54:44,840 --> 09:54:50,840
I wish like the enemy to allies type thing came a lot faster as well.

4767
09:54:50,840 --> 09:55:01,840
I liked the scene when they were at the poker table in particular, and it was like, hold on a minute, we're all against this German guy and it was like, well, keep up that energy, like, keep it going.

4768
09:55:01,840 --> 09:55:12,840
Um, because the guy with the dog doesn't, so he clearly wanted the bounty for John Wick, one big bounty and then he's done,

4769
09:55:12,840 --> 09:55:15,840
but he's very clearly a skilled assassin.

4770
09:55:15,840 --> 09:55:24,840
So, really, what's the dealio about him not just going for like, really simple targets other than, you know, Baba Yaga himself?

4771
09:55:24,840 --> 09:55:34,840
Nah, I know you could say, but the money was so much for him over anything else, but like, I feel like that ally arc could have happened hell of a lot quicker.

4772
09:55:34,840 --> 09:55:48,840
And then Kane at the end, like, just fucking going up those 222 steps, I was like, fucking hurry up, man.

4773
09:55:48,840 --> 09:55:55,840
Like, there was a few scenes where I'm like, hmm, I wasn't exactly digging it.

4774
09:55:55,840 --> 09:55:59,840
Klaus was funny though, I am Klaus.

4775
09:56:00,840 --> 09:56:09,840
Yeah, I don't, I think, I think maybe, I don't know why the fighting scenes don't really seem to do it as much for me.

4776
09:56:09,840 --> 09:56:11,840
I felt like they just went on too long.

4777
09:56:11,840 --> 09:56:24,840
Now, I like when they're like, oh, look how cool he's doing this and that, but I don't know if maybe because I can't appreciate the choreography the way maybe someone else can, um, that it looks very seamy.

4778
09:56:24,840 --> 09:56:37,840
I think the reason why I appreciate the, um, the bird's eye view scene, so much Hotline Miami scene, if you will, was because it looked completely different.

4779
09:56:37,840 --> 09:56:43,840
And it gave you a perspective of like enemies from all sides and he just keeps mowing them down.

4780
09:56:43,840 --> 09:56:52,840
Whereas like the jump cuts and the other battle scene, battle scene, well, I guess they are battles technically, just felt like, okay, okay, we get it, we get it.

4781
09:56:52,840 --> 09:56:54,840
But as Baba Yaga, okay, we get it.

4782
09:56:54,840 --> 09:56:57,840
Wrap it up, wrap it up.

4783
09:56:57,840 --> 09:57:00,840
Keanu Reeves is 59?

4784
09:57:00,840 --> 09:57:05,840
No, he needs to stop doing his own stunts like right now.

4785
09:57:10,840 --> 09:57:13,840
He needs to stop doing stunts right now.

4786
09:57:13,840 --> 09:57:15,840
He is, he is beyond like repair.

4787
09:57:15,840 --> 09:57:19,840
He's probably done some serious damage during those shoots then, if that's true.

4788
09:57:19,840 --> 09:57:21,840
Holy crap, 59.

4789
09:57:22,840 --> 09:57:26,840
They were cool at first, but yeah, after the fourth one is starts to look a bit seamy.

4790
09:57:26,840 --> 09:57:34,840
Yes, I'm sure if like we were choreography people, we would be able to be like, ah, this tactic and this was used and that was used.

4791
09:57:34,840 --> 09:57:46,840
But fortunately, I do not have an eye that can appreciate that type of art, so I can only apologize through my ignorant eye that, um, it did look a bit seamy.

4792
09:57:46,840 --> 09:57:48,840
Well, he's dead, so he doesn't need to do any more stunts.

4793
09:57:48,840 --> 09:57:50,840
Thank you for rubbing that in, Reefling.

4794
09:57:50,840 --> 09:57:52,840
Just for you, here's the timeout.

4795
09:57:52,840 --> 09:57:54,840
Oh, hold on, need to open up.

4796
09:57:54,840 --> 09:57:56,840
Oh, for fuck's sake, I can't.

4797
09:57:56,840 --> 09:57:58,840
Wait, I need to close my...

4798
09:57:58,840 --> 09:58:00,840
Where's the heck is my wee window?

4799
09:58:03,840 --> 09:58:05,840
Hold on a minute.

4800
09:58:05,840 --> 09:58:08,840
Right, put that away because we don't need it.

4801
09:58:08,840 --> 09:58:11,840
Put that away because we don't need it and put that away because we don't need it.

4802
09:58:11,840 --> 09:58:15,840
Okay, and then I open up YouTube.

4803
09:58:15,840 --> 09:58:17,840
No, Mod, did you just take it?

4804
09:58:17,840 --> 09:58:18,840
I'm supposed to do it.

4805
09:58:18,840 --> 09:58:20,840
No, Mod, you ruined it.

4806
09:58:20,840 --> 09:58:21,840
I'm supposed to do it.

4807
09:58:24,840 --> 09:58:26,840
You didn't actually ruin it, Mod, by the way, I'm just teasing.

4808
09:58:26,840 --> 09:58:32,840
Um, what was I saying before I got wildly distracted there?

4809
09:58:32,840 --> 09:58:34,840
Uh, needing to time out anyone?

4810
09:58:34,840 --> 09:58:35,840
Rip that one Reefling.

4811
09:58:35,840 --> 09:58:36,840
Mod, span that, Mod.

4812
09:58:36,840 --> 09:58:38,840
Mod, time out that, Mod.

4813
09:58:38,840 --> 09:58:39,840
What's going on?

4814
09:58:39,840 --> 09:58:42,840
Um, but yes.

4815
09:58:46,840 --> 09:58:48,840
It's a, what?

4816
09:58:48,840 --> 09:58:52,840
Wait a minute, is this a culture clash?

4817
09:58:52,840 --> 09:58:55,840
Someone says what's half-a-living.

4818
09:58:58,840 --> 09:59:01,840
Reeflings, what time is half-a-living?

4819
09:59:03,840 --> 09:59:05,840
Is this a culture clash?

4820
09:59:05,840 --> 09:59:07,840
Do you guys not use this freeze?

4821
09:59:09,840 --> 09:59:11,840
What's half-a-living?

4822
09:59:12,840 --> 09:59:14,840
See one.

4823
09:59:14,840 --> 09:59:16,840
Whoa.

4824
09:59:16,840 --> 09:59:19,840
Okay, hold on.

4825
09:59:19,840 --> 09:59:22,840
You don't say that in America.

4826
09:59:28,840 --> 09:59:30,840
Okay.

4827
09:59:30,840 --> 09:59:33,840
Half-a-living means 1130.

4828
09:59:33,840 --> 09:59:37,840
Like half past 11, half-a-living.

4829
09:59:37,840 --> 09:59:40,840
Half past 10, half-10.

4830
09:59:40,840 --> 09:59:41,840
Who says half-a-living?

4831
09:59:41,840 --> 09:59:42,840
British folk apparently.

4832
09:59:42,840 --> 09:59:46,840
Someone's just commented on my most recent ASMR roleplay.

4833
09:59:46,840 --> 09:59:48,840
They're like, what's half-a-living?

4834
09:59:48,840 --> 09:59:51,840
Uh, wow, I did not know that.

4835
09:59:51,840 --> 09:59:53,840
You learn something new every day.

4836
09:59:53,840 --> 09:59:55,840
Hmm.

4837
10:00:05,840 --> 10:00:07,840
Whee.

4838
10:00:07,840 --> 10:00:09,840
Yes.

4839
10:00:09,840 --> 10:00:14,840
Someone says, I hope Stronea isn't actually a 43 foot giant squid using a voice changer.

4840
10:00:16,840 --> 10:00:18,840
Well.

4841
10:00:19,840 --> 10:00:21,840
Half-a-living, no.

4842
10:00:21,840 --> 10:00:28,840
Half-of-a-living is 5.25 or something.

4843
10:00:28,840 --> 10:00:29,840
Wait, no.

4844
10:00:29,840 --> 10:00:30,840
5.5, yeah.

4845
10:00:30,840 --> 10:00:32,840
Sorry, we don't speak EU.

4846
10:00:32,840 --> 10:00:33,840
Britons are wrong.

4847
10:00:33,840 --> 10:00:34,840
Britons are wrong.

4848
10:00:34,840 --> 10:00:35,840
Steady on.

4849
10:00:35,840 --> 10:00:36,840
Didn't we make the English language?

4850
10:00:36,840 --> 10:00:38,840
And by make, I mean steel parts of the French,

4851
10:00:38,840 --> 10:00:39,840
and then steel parts of the Germanic,

4852
10:00:39,840 --> 10:00:41,840
and then steel parts of the Latin.

4853
10:00:41,840 --> 10:00:43,840
She might be.

4854
10:00:44,840 --> 10:00:46,840
If Stronea's that big, imagine how,

4855
10:00:46,840 --> 10:00:48,840
imagine how much ink we should.

4856
10:00:48,840 --> 10:00:52,840
Oh, wow, we're actually about to get 29,000 on the wings.

4857
10:00:52,840 --> 10:00:54,840
Hmm.

4858
10:01:01,840 --> 10:01:02,840
Hmm.

4859
10:01:02,840 --> 10:01:04,840
5.25.

4860
10:01:04,840 --> 10:01:05,840
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

4861
10:01:05,840 --> 10:01:07,840
I've just had an emotional breakdown.

4862
10:01:07,840 --> 10:01:09,840
Thanks to John Wick 4.

4863
10:01:09,840 --> 10:01:13,840
I need to know, like, right now what the heck happens.

4864
10:01:16,840 --> 10:01:18,840
Still a level 92.

4865
10:01:18,840 --> 10:01:23,840
I, um, should we try and get 93 before I go off?

4866
10:01:23,840 --> 10:01:26,840
Now, I know I said I was going to do an endurance stream.

4867
10:01:26,840 --> 10:01:28,840
I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.

4868
10:01:28,840 --> 10:01:30,840
I am emotionally distraught right now.

4869
10:01:30,840 --> 10:01:33,840
My eyes are bulging out of the skull from how hard I was just crying there.

4870
10:01:33,840 --> 10:01:37,840
I'm not even going to pretend like I'm a crybaby.

4871
10:01:37,840 --> 10:01:40,840
Yeah, but we Britbongs shorten things sometimes.

4872
10:01:40,840 --> 10:01:41,840
I get what you mean.

4873
10:01:41,840 --> 10:01:42,840
Steal this, steal that.

4874
10:01:42,840 --> 10:01:45,840
How about you steal back the tea we dumped a mile?

4875
10:01:45,840 --> 10:01:47,840
Horny horny hor.

4876
10:01:47,840 --> 10:01:48,840
Oh my god.

4877
10:01:48,840 --> 10:01:52,840
Remember that one time the Americans revolted against British taxation

4878
10:01:52,840 --> 10:01:54,840
by putting the D into the harbor and it worked,

4879
10:01:54,840 --> 10:01:57,840
which is actually pretty crazy because normally,

4880
10:01:57,840 --> 10:02:01,840
actually, I tell a lie, you don't normally get taught

4881
10:02:01,840 --> 10:02:03,840
when revolution works.

4882
10:02:03,840 --> 10:02:06,840
It's, um, purposely not taught that often.

4883
10:02:07,840 --> 10:02:10,840
Unless it's done via memes, which is why everyone finds,

4884
10:02:10,840 --> 10:02:12,840
ha ha, dumping tea in the harbor funny,

4885
10:02:12,840 --> 10:02:15,840
but it's actually a form of revolution

4886
10:02:15,840 --> 10:02:20,840
and you're not really, you don't get many examples of it working.

4887
10:02:20,840 --> 10:02:25,840
Now you don't name another example of a revolution working.

4888
10:02:25,840 --> 10:02:28,840
It's okay, you can rest and we'll continue tomorrow.

4889
10:02:28,840 --> 10:02:30,840
What a waste of good tea.

4890
10:02:30,840 --> 10:02:33,840
Our little cuddly seaweed.

4891
10:02:33,840 --> 10:02:35,840
Tenors is an endurance stream.

4892
10:02:36,840 --> 10:02:40,840
And hospital and hospital.

4893
10:02:40,840 --> 10:02:43,840
Yeah, you get, yeah, you skip the duck

4894
10:02:43,840 --> 10:02:47,840
because, you know, you're still at the hospital either way.

4895
10:02:47,840 --> 10:02:49,840
Our little cry baby.

4896
10:02:49,840 --> 10:02:50,840
Yeah, you can do that.

4897
10:02:50,840 --> 10:02:52,840
You can make me cry again.

4898
10:02:52,840 --> 10:02:55,840
What if I cried and then you put me on your lap

4899
10:02:55,840 --> 10:02:57,840
and then like pet my hair and stuff

4900
10:02:57,840 --> 10:03:00,840
and rocked me back and forth,

4901
10:03:00,840 --> 10:03:03,840
reinsuring me that John Wick was a good man.

4902
10:03:03,840 --> 10:03:08,840
Um, I mean, yeah, yeah, I'll do it.

4903
10:03:08,840 --> 10:03:12,840
Damn, no chance of getting you to watch my queer

4904
10:03:12,840 --> 10:03:14,840
when the promise flower blooms

4905
10:03:14,840 --> 10:03:17,840
then that movie will make you call your mom crying your butt.

4906
10:03:17,840 --> 10:03:22,840
Stop, no, I'm not touching any film that has any...

4907
10:03:22,840 --> 10:03:24,840
Someone said how to train your dragon

4908
10:03:24,840 --> 10:03:26,840
and I'm pretty sure I got a warrant.

4909
10:03:26,840 --> 10:03:29,840
Someone else commented as a warning being like,

4910
10:03:29,840 --> 10:03:30,840
do not put that on.

4911
10:03:30,840 --> 10:03:32,840
And I'm like, ew, okay.

4912
10:03:32,840 --> 10:03:35,840
I thought it was just a cute show about a dragon.

4913
10:03:35,840 --> 10:03:39,840
A cute movie because the first movie I did watch

4914
10:03:39,840 --> 10:03:43,840
where he gets the dragon

4915
10:03:43,840 --> 10:03:46,840
and they become friends and they can both fly

4916
10:03:46,840 --> 10:03:48,840
but they need each other and stuff.

4917
10:03:48,840 --> 10:03:53,840
Um, but yeah.

4918
10:03:53,840 --> 10:03:56,840
You're as beautiful as the day I lost you.

4919
10:03:56,840 --> 10:03:58,840
Mmm, I've seen that a lot.

4920
10:03:58,840 --> 10:04:00,840
I don't know what it's from, but...

4921
10:04:00,840 --> 10:04:01,840
But no, sorry.

4922
10:04:01,840 --> 10:04:03,840
I know it's from how to train your dragon

4923
10:04:03,840 --> 10:04:05,840
but I don't, like, I've not seen that.

4924
10:04:05,840 --> 10:04:07,840
Mmm, maybe it's in the second one.

4925
10:04:07,840 --> 10:04:11,840
I think there's three how to train your dragon.

4926
10:04:11,840 --> 10:04:14,840
How come how to train your dragon is nice?

4927
10:04:14,840 --> 10:04:16,840
I don't know, someone warned me saying

4928
10:04:16,840 --> 10:04:18,840
that there's something emotionally distraught in it

4929
10:04:18,840 --> 10:04:20,840
and I'd probably be an absolute blubber and mess.

4930
10:04:20,840 --> 10:04:22,840
I need to recover and do some, like, funny ha ha,

4931
10:04:22,840 --> 10:04:27,840
like, um, the Monty Python type stuff.

4932
10:04:27,840 --> 10:04:30,840
Funny ha ha, Iron Man again, it's got good music in it

4933
10:04:30,840 --> 10:04:33,840
and we can look at the cool weapons and stuff.

4934
10:04:33,840 --> 10:04:37,840
Like, I need to recover from what I've experienced today.

4935
10:04:37,840 --> 10:04:39,840
Cocky just...

4936
10:04:39,840 --> 10:04:41,840
Oh, there's a John Wick 5.

4937
10:04:41,840 --> 10:04:44,840
Obviously he can't perish and he perishes.

4938
10:04:44,840 --> 10:04:47,840
Ugh, now watch the second one.

4939
10:04:47,840 --> 10:04:49,840
The second movie, is it okay?

4940
10:04:49,840 --> 10:04:51,840
Gotta cry every time I have to train your dragon too.

4941
10:04:51,840 --> 10:04:53,840
Okay, so that's what's making me...

4942
10:04:53,840 --> 10:04:54,840
I'm getting nervous.

4943
10:04:54,840 --> 10:04:55,840
I'm getting nervous.

4944
10:04:55,840 --> 10:04:56,840
I'm getting shaky about that movie.

4945
10:04:56,840 --> 10:04:58,840
We'll come back, I wouldn't mind watching it

4946
10:04:58,840 --> 10:05:01,840
because it was, like, the only book I read as a child.

4947
10:05:01,840 --> 10:05:03,840
Um, oops.

4948
10:05:03,840 --> 10:05:05,840
Um...

4949
10:05:05,840 --> 10:05:07,840
But I need time, I need time to progress

4950
10:05:07,840 --> 10:05:08,840
what I've just went through.

4951
10:05:08,840 --> 10:05:10,840
Okay, I don't feel well.

4952
10:05:10,840 --> 10:05:12,840
I don't feel well.

4953
10:05:12,840 --> 10:05:14,840
I want to wrap myself up in a burrito.

4954
10:05:14,840 --> 10:05:16,840
I want to nuke myself on TikTok.

4955
10:05:16,840 --> 10:05:17,840
I would actually like to see more movies

4956
10:05:17,840 --> 10:05:19,840
slash shows that would make you cry

4957
10:05:19,840 --> 10:05:23,840
so that us leaflings can take care of you afterwards.

4958
10:05:23,840 --> 10:05:25,840
Okay, that's different.

4959
10:05:25,840 --> 10:05:26,840
That's different, then.

4960
10:05:26,840 --> 10:05:27,840
I'll allow it.

4961
10:05:27,840 --> 10:05:28,840
Um...

4962
10:05:28,840 --> 10:05:29,840
Oh, I forgot.

4963
10:05:29,840 --> 10:05:31,840
I'm ventriloquism right now.

4964
10:05:31,840 --> 10:05:32,840
I completely forgot that.

4965
10:05:32,840 --> 10:05:34,840
Is this still broken?

4966
10:05:34,840 --> 10:05:37,840
Hold on, let me close.

4967
10:05:37,840 --> 10:05:40,840
I don't know why it's lagging behind,

4968
10:05:40,840 --> 10:05:42,840
but I'll just ventriloquist.

4969
10:05:42,840 --> 10:05:44,840
Thank you for the tip, Anon.

4970
10:05:44,840 --> 10:05:45,840
Anonymous, sorry.

4971
10:05:45,840 --> 10:05:47,840
I need to see your full name.

4972
10:05:47,840 --> 10:05:49,840
Anonymous, that's right.

4973
10:05:49,840 --> 10:05:51,840
You want me to cry more?

4974
10:05:51,840 --> 10:05:52,840
I mean, shit, let's just build up

4975
10:05:52,840 --> 10:05:54,840
how to train your dragon tomorrow, fuck it.

4976
10:05:55,840 --> 10:05:56,840
You want tears?

4977
10:05:56,840 --> 10:05:58,840
I'll show you tears.

4978
10:06:06,840 --> 10:06:08,840
Usually when I'm sad or go through

4979
10:06:08,840 --> 10:06:10,840
is when I watch shows that are sad

4980
10:06:10,840 --> 10:06:12,840
and jokes I knew I was already sad.

4981
10:06:12,840 --> 10:06:14,840
No, I would never do that.

4982
10:06:14,840 --> 10:06:17,840
When I'm sad, I try my best to like...

4983
10:06:17,840 --> 10:06:19,840
Well, work, I guess.

4984
10:06:19,840 --> 10:06:21,840
I just work through everything, to be honest.

4985
10:06:21,840 --> 10:06:23,840
Hold on a minute.

4986
10:06:23,840 --> 10:06:26,840
My own secret, I've cracked my own secret.

4987
10:06:26,840 --> 10:06:30,840
Yes, I just work through sadness.

4988
10:06:30,840 --> 10:06:32,840
I don't know, this sounds a bit silly,

4989
10:06:32,840 --> 10:06:35,840
but I don't really have time to be emotionally upset.

4990
10:06:35,840 --> 10:06:38,840
I have half work to do, sorry.

4991
10:06:38,840 --> 10:06:43,840
Earlier when I was editing the Patreon audio,

4992
10:06:43,840 --> 10:06:46,840
I say it earlier, it was probably 24 hours ago,

4993
10:06:46,840 --> 10:06:49,840
I guess I was doing it, maybe, I don't know.

4994
10:06:49,840 --> 10:06:51,840
Or 12 hours?

4995
10:06:51,840 --> 10:06:53,840
You know what I mean.

4996
10:06:53,840 --> 10:06:56,840
When I was editing it, I was like...

4997
10:06:56,840 --> 10:06:59,840
I was getting really tired of editing,

4998
10:06:59,840 --> 10:07:02,840
I feel frustrated because I have all these plans

4999
10:07:02,840 --> 10:07:06,840
and three more VTubers have agreed to do ASMR with me

5000
10:07:06,840 --> 10:07:09,840
and I feel like I'm letting them down type thing.

5001
10:07:09,840 --> 10:07:11,840
And I was getting frustrated and I was like,

5002
10:07:11,840 --> 10:07:14,840
I just want to lie down and rot, basically.

5003
10:07:14,840 --> 10:07:19,840
But then I was like, no, the reeflings need their inking session.

5004
10:07:22,840 --> 10:07:26,840
Yeah, but it's funny you always work too much, I don't know.

5005
10:07:26,840 --> 10:07:29,840
But I felt frustrated, but then I was like,

5006
10:07:29,840 --> 10:07:31,840
I don't have time to be frustrated,

5007
10:07:31,840 --> 10:07:33,840
I need to just keep going.

5008
10:07:33,840 --> 10:07:37,840
Who's that guy that's condemned to push that rock up the hill

5009
10:07:37,840 --> 10:07:39,840
and it always falls down at the end?

5010
10:07:39,840 --> 10:07:41,840
A bit dramatic of a comparison,

5011
10:07:41,840 --> 10:07:45,840
but I'm very late.

5012
10:07:45,840 --> 10:07:48,840
We have finished all four movies, there's no more movies.

5013
10:07:48,840 --> 10:07:51,840
It's just me explaining how distraught I am.

5014
10:07:51,840 --> 10:07:54,840
Please do not watch the John Wick series

5015
10:07:54,840 --> 10:07:59,840
if you find yourself to be a crybaby like myself, okay?

5016
10:07:59,840 --> 10:08:02,840
If you right-click the XP circle near the mini-map

5017
10:08:02,840 --> 10:08:05,840
and do set up, what does that mean?

5018
10:08:05,840 --> 10:08:08,840
XP, show XP drops.

5019
10:08:08,840 --> 10:08:11,840
This? You want this?

5020
10:08:11,840 --> 10:08:15,840
Okay, I put it on.

5021
10:08:16,840 --> 10:08:18,840
I think we'll get to level 93.

5022
10:08:18,840 --> 10:08:20,840
Wait, why did you go away?

5023
10:08:20,840 --> 10:08:21,840
Is that the right thing?

5024
10:08:21,840 --> 10:08:23,840
If you right-click, right-click.

5025
10:08:23,840 --> 10:08:25,840
Set up.

5026
10:08:25,840 --> 10:08:27,840
Whoa, what does it mean?

5027
10:08:27,840 --> 10:08:29,840
Do cooking, please.

5028
10:08:37,840 --> 10:08:40,840
Yeah, that looks right.

5029
10:08:41,840 --> 10:08:44,840
And then this blue, what the fuck?

5030
10:08:44,840 --> 10:08:46,840
Sorry, hold on.

5031
10:08:46,840 --> 10:08:48,840
Hold on, I'm being Papaga.

5032
10:08:48,840 --> 10:08:49,840
Wait, did I just level up?

5033
10:08:49,840 --> 10:08:50,840
No, it didn't.

5034
10:08:50,840 --> 10:08:52,840
What?

5035
10:08:53,840 --> 10:08:54,840
What?

5036
10:08:54,840 --> 10:08:56,840
Wait, people can see it.

5037
10:08:56,840 --> 10:08:58,840
Hold on.

5038
10:08:58,840 --> 10:09:00,840
Why does that not keep displaying?

5039
10:09:00,840 --> 10:09:01,840
Right-medium default.

5040
10:09:01,840 --> 10:09:03,840
Duration, perma.

5041
10:09:03,840 --> 10:09:04,840
Okay.

5042
10:09:04,840 --> 10:09:05,840
And what?

5043
10:09:05,840 --> 10:09:06,840
It stays up?

5044
10:09:06,840 --> 10:09:08,840
You stay up?

5045
10:09:08,840 --> 10:09:10,840
You stay up?

5046
10:09:10,840 --> 10:09:13,840
Okay, I think it stays up now.

5047
10:09:14,840 --> 10:09:16,840
Eh.

5048
10:09:17,840 --> 10:09:21,840
The reeflings need their incincision to take me out through for all.

5049
10:09:21,840 --> 10:09:23,840
Look, I get motivated in many ways.

5050
10:09:23,840 --> 10:09:26,840
Some ways are...

5051
10:09:28,840 --> 10:09:32,840
What the heck happened to my inventory to achieve that?

5052
10:09:32,840 --> 10:09:34,840
Hope you aren't getting too stressed.

5053
10:09:34,840 --> 10:09:36,840
No, things are like definitely coming down.

5054
10:09:36,840 --> 10:09:40,840
It's because I'm doing that thing where I give myself too much work at once.

5055
10:09:40,840 --> 10:09:42,840
That's what stressed me out.

5056
10:09:43,840 --> 10:09:49,840
I need to edit my Patreon audios for July.

5057
10:09:49,840 --> 10:09:51,840
I've not done that.

5058
10:09:51,840 --> 10:09:54,840
Because I've been focused on getting the girls set up with shorts now.

5059
10:09:54,840 --> 10:10:00,840
That's the next thing is trying to do shorts and getting them up-tick in subscribers.

5060
10:10:00,840 --> 10:10:04,840
Because I would love to get them play buttons at the end of the day.

5061
10:10:04,840 --> 10:10:06,840
I'm going to try my best.

5062
10:10:06,840 --> 10:10:08,840
I'm going to try my best.

5063
10:10:08,840 --> 10:10:10,840
I'm going to tell them everything that I'm doing.

5064
10:10:10,840 --> 10:10:13,840
And I hope for the best.

5065
10:10:13,840 --> 10:10:16,840
But it would be lovely to get them a play button.

5066
10:10:18,840 --> 10:10:20,840
Should we clip watch-alongs?

5067
10:10:20,840 --> 10:10:25,840
What, the part with me when I'm just crying uncontrollably?

5068
10:10:26,840 --> 10:10:27,840
Syphilis?

5069
10:10:27,840 --> 10:10:28,840
What?

5070
10:10:28,840 --> 10:10:30,840
Oh, Sisyphus.

5071
10:10:30,840 --> 10:10:31,840
Sorry.

5072
10:10:31,840 --> 10:10:35,840
I completely missed when you guys said the Rolling Stones guy name.

5073
10:10:35,840 --> 10:10:38,840
Where he shoves a stone up the hill.

5074
10:10:38,840 --> 10:10:42,840
I literally thought you were all seeing Syphilis and Unison at once.

5075
10:10:42,840 --> 10:10:46,840
And I'm like, what on earth did I see to get you guys to see that at the same time?

5076
10:10:46,840 --> 10:10:48,840
That was...

5077
10:10:48,840 --> 10:10:50,840
That was confused there.

5078
10:10:51,840 --> 10:10:54,840
There's GD clinics down at the left, love, honestly.

5079
10:10:54,840 --> 10:10:55,840
Honestly.

5080
10:10:56,840 --> 10:10:58,840
Wait, let me...

5081
10:10:58,840 --> 10:11:00,840
What do you call it, a sheebie like that?

5082
10:11:00,840 --> 10:11:03,840
It was a sheebie's internet that was dial-up.

5083
10:11:04,840 --> 10:11:06,840
It was Azura's internet.

5084
10:11:06,840 --> 10:11:10,840
I'm gonna try and get her moved out so I can buy her better internet.

5085
10:11:12,840 --> 10:11:13,840
Sort of PC.

5086
10:11:13,840 --> 10:11:14,840
Yeah, or PC.

5087
10:11:14,840 --> 10:11:15,840
Internet can keep up.

5088
10:11:15,840 --> 10:11:17,840
I clipped the part after the movie.

5089
10:11:17,840 --> 10:11:19,840
She said a really cool line.

5090
10:11:21,840 --> 10:11:23,840
Yeah, the leader sang into the Rolling Stones.

5091
10:11:24,840 --> 10:11:26,840
Mom, is it like 5 a.m.?

5092
10:11:26,840 --> 10:11:28,840
It is 2 p.m.

5093
10:11:28,840 --> 10:11:30,840
For me.

5094
10:11:31,840 --> 10:11:34,840
Because I run a business in Australia.

5095
10:11:34,840 --> 10:11:36,840
That's not even a joke.

5096
10:11:36,840 --> 10:11:38,840
There's no booms at the end of that.

5097
10:11:38,840 --> 10:11:41,840
It's like, it's a bridge, honestly.

5098
10:11:43,840 --> 10:11:44,840
But yes.

5099
10:11:45,840 --> 10:11:47,840
Remaining XP.

5100
10:11:47,840 --> 10:11:48,840
64.

5101
10:11:48,840 --> 10:11:50,840
Wait, why isn't it showing a big bar like that?

5102
10:11:50,840 --> 10:11:52,840
I've done that bar wrong.

5103
10:11:52,840 --> 10:11:53,840
Hmm.

5104
10:11:54,840 --> 10:11:55,840
Hold on.

5105
10:11:55,840 --> 10:11:57,840
I've done this wrong.

5106
10:11:57,840 --> 10:11:59,840
Set up.

5107
10:12:00,840 --> 10:12:01,840
What?

5108
10:12:04,840 --> 10:12:07,840
Just disable the current character.

5109
10:12:14,840 --> 10:12:15,840
Like...

5110
10:12:17,840 --> 10:12:18,840
Whoa!

5111
10:12:18,840 --> 10:12:19,840
I am smart.

5112
10:12:19,840 --> 10:12:20,840
I am so smart.

5113
10:12:20,840 --> 10:12:21,840
SMRT.

5114
10:12:23,840 --> 10:12:25,840
Is that what I was supposed to do?

5115
10:12:25,840 --> 10:12:27,840
Set the top line?

5116
10:12:27,840 --> 10:12:29,840
Set the top line?

5117
10:12:29,840 --> 10:12:30,840
Oh.

5118
10:12:30,840 --> 10:12:31,840
I mean, does this not work?

5119
10:12:31,840 --> 10:12:33,840
Technically this works?

5120
10:12:33,840 --> 10:12:35,840
And you can see I'm like right about to get it.

5121
10:12:37,840 --> 10:12:39,840
7 hours of driving.

5122
10:12:39,840 --> 10:12:40,840
Holy shit.

5123
10:12:40,840 --> 10:12:43,840
I would be bored out of my mind, I think.

5124
10:12:43,840 --> 10:12:45,840
I'd be a menace on the road.

5125
10:12:45,840 --> 10:12:46,840
That works.

5126
10:12:46,840 --> 10:12:47,840
Yeah, close enough.

5127
10:12:47,840 --> 10:12:48,840
We got there in the end.

5128
10:12:48,840 --> 10:12:49,840
That's the main thing.

5129
10:12:49,840 --> 10:12:51,840
It's just showing you the next level.

5130
10:12:51,840 --> 10:12:55,840
Yeah, we are gonna finish 47.

5131
10:12:55,840 --> 10:12:58,840
I don't think there's any other...

5132
10:12:58,840 --> 10:12:59,840
Brian!

5133
10:13:08,840 --> 10:13:09,840
Oh no, I'm okay.

5134
10:13:09,840 --> 10:13:10,840
I just...

5135
10:13:10,840 --> 10:13:14,840
Why the frick is this not going out of my inventory?

5136
10:13:14,840 --> 10:13:16,840
No, don't worry.

5137
10:13:16,840 --> 10:13:17,840
I'm honestly fine.

5138
10:13:17,840 --> 10:13:19,840
Thank you for the tip again.

5139
10:13:19,840 --> 10:13:20,840
Thank you for the 5.

5140
10:13:20,840 --> 10:13:21,840
Broly legend.

5141
10:13:21,840 --> 10:13:22,840
I promise I'm okay.

5142
10:13:22,840 --> 10:13:23,840
I'm just a cry baby.

5143
10:13:23,840 --> 10:13:25,840
That's the problem.

5144
10:13:28,840 --> 10:13:29,840
Yes.

5145
10:13:29,840 --> 10:13:30,840
I should think about lunch.

5146
10:13:30,840 --> 10:13:32,840
I have work in one hour.

5147
10:13:32,840 --> 10:13:33,840
Monk guys.

5148
10:13:33,840 --> 10:13:34,840
Monk guys.

5149
10:13:34,840 --> 10:13:37,840
I don't think there's any Villarra girl on right now.

5150
10:13:40,840 --> 10:13:42,840
So we'll be redirecting into someone.

5151
10:13:42,840 --> 10:13:44,840
I don't know who yet.

5152
10:13:45,840 --> 10:13:48,840
I was gonna bring my iron here and get 9-9 Kirk and Mesa.

5153
10:13:48,840 --> 10:13:49,840
Oops.

5154
10:13:49,840 --> 10:13:51,840
What does that mean?

5155
10:13:51,840 --> 10:13:54,840
Right, let's see if I can find someone to redirect into them.

5156
10:13:54,840 --> 10:13:56,840
Maybe there's a Yumi plus girl up.

5157
10:13:56,840 --> 10:13:59,840
They kinda do it a bit later than us.

5158
10:14:03,840 --> 10:14:05,840
Oh, they're playing Apex together.

5159
10:14:05,840 --> 10:14:06,840
That's...

5160
10:14:06,840 --> 10:14:07,840
Oh no, Azura's on League!

5161
10:14:07,840 --> 10:14:08,840
Oh, hold on, hold on.

5162
10:14:08,840 --> 10:14:13,840
Can someone bomb Azura's chat and ask her if she's going a bit further?

5163
10:14:15,840 --> 10:14:16,840
Can someone...

5164
10:14:16,840 --> 10:14:21,840
Any bleeding hearts want to ask if Azura is staying up a bit longer?

5165
10:14:22,840 --> 10:14:24,840
Get yourself some good takeout.

5166
10:14:25,840 --> 10:14:27,840
I actually need to boil my eggs.

5167
10:14:27,840 --> 10:14:31,840
I've bought eggs and then I've wasted 2.

5168
10:14:35,840 --> 10:14:38,840
Azura is addicted to League, sadly, yes.

5169
10:14:38,840 --> 10:14:40,840
It's ogre for her truly.

5170
10:14:47,840 --> 10:14:51,840
I've been stuck with lots of work and it doesn't help that outside of that

5171
10:14:51,840 --> 10:14:54,840
I've been feeling espresso-depresso.

5172
10:14:54,840 --> 10:14:55,840
I get you and I hope things...

5173
10:14:55,840 --> 10:14:57,840
Oh no, things get easier for me.

5174
10:14:57,840 --> 10:14:59,840
I like reset after I sleep.

5175
10:14:59,840 --> 10:15:02,840
Like, if I ever have the worst day of my life, I just need to sleep

5176
10:15:02,840 --> 10:15:04,840
and then I'll wake up and I'm like, oh, okay.

5177
10:15:04,840 --> 10:15:06,840
Okay, let's go again.

5178
10:15:06,840 --> 10:15:08,840
I'm like, okay, let me get it.

5179
10:15:08,840 --> 10:15:10,840
Let's see what edits I can do.

5180
10:15:10,840 --> 10:15:12,840
She's deep in the League minds.

5181
10:15:12,840 --> 10:15:13,840
Is she?

5182
10:15:13,840 --> 10:15:14,840
Direct into her then?

5183
10:15:14,840 --> 10:15:15,840
Right, hold on, let me...

5184
10:15:15,840 --> 10:15:17,840
Save changes.

5185
10:15:19,840 --> 10:15:20,840
Okay.

5186
10:15:22,840 --> 10:15:23,840
Right, we're almost there, oh my god.

5187
10:15:23,840 --> 10:15:29,840
And we're in 50, 29,000 wains.

5188
10:15:29,840 --> 10:15:30,840
So we're getting there.

5189
10:15:30,840 --> 10:15:32,840
So how many did we do today?

5190
10:15:32,840 --> 10:15:34,840
Like, over 10,000?

5191
10:15:34,840 --> 10:15:37,840
So what, that's two more endurance streams?

5192
10:15:37,840 --> 10:15:42,840
I just want to warn you, the odds of tomorrow's stream being changed are quite high.

5193
10:15:42,840 --> 10:15:43,840
Okay.

5194
10:15:43,840 --> 10:15:45,840
Do I think I'll be able to re...

5195
10:15:45,840 --> 10:15:46,840
Oh, easily.

5196
10:15:46,840 --> 10:15:48,840
We just need another...

5197
10:15:48,840 --> 10:15:52,840
Tomorrow I was going to watch my gen mate's content,

5198
10:15:52,840 --> 10:15:57,840
but I think I might be too emotionally upset for a longer stream.

5199
10:15:57,840 --> 10:15:58,840
Me.

5200
10:15:58,840 --> 10:16:00,840
Oh, I reset after I sleep.

5201
10:16:00,840 --> 10:16:02,840
Also me, I'm so emotionally upset over John Wick.

5202
10:16:02,840 --> 10:16:05,840
I cannot, like, have an endurance stream tomorrow.

5203
10:16:05,840 --> 10:16:07,840
I need to give myself a break.

5204
10:16:08,840 --> 10:16:12,840
Because I'm actually withering away.

5205
10:16:12,840 --> 10:16:14,840
What does it say?

5206
10:16:14,840 --> 10:16:19,840
You can make around 2.4k wains an hour if you're curious how long it'll be.

5207
10:16:19,840 --> 10:16:23,840
So if I've got 29, divide by 2...

5208
10:16:25,840 --> 10:16:28,840
Okay, let's do 20, divide by 2 instead.

5209
10:16:28,840 --> 10:16:34,840
Another 14 hours, so technically 2 endurance streams and then I'm good to go.

5210
10:16:34,840 --> 10:16:35,840
We did it.

5211
10:16:38,840 --> 10:16:40,840
So, Veltro then.

5212
10:16:40,840 --> 10:16:42,840
Possibly.

5213
10:16:42,840 --> 10:16:46,840
I do, I'm really, I'm thoroughly enjoying Veltro.

5214
10:16:46,840 --> 10:16:49,840
I want to see if I can get a win on every deck.

5215
10:16:49,840 --> 10:16:51,840
Whether or not we'll get it or not,

5216
10:16:51,840 --> 10:16:55,840
but our little trouser pants thing is just so OP.

5217
10:16:55,840 --> 10:17:00,840
And we're unlocking new cards as well for interesting, like, combinations and stuff coming up.

5218
10:17:00,840 --> 10:17:01,840
Combination.

5219
10:17:01,840 --> 10:17:04,840
So 11 hours if you're perfect.

5220
10:17:05,840 --> 10:17:08,840
No, I've got 29,000 wains.

5221
10:17:10,840 --> 10:17:13,840
What, 2.4k? Oh no, there's no way.

5222
10:17:13,840 --> 10:17:16,840
Didn't manage to drop my fire-making cake.

5223
10:17:16,840 --> 10:17:18,840
Cake, not cake, sorry.

5224
10:17:18,840 --> 10:17:21,840
Don't drop the cake, don't drop the cake, baby.

5225
10:17:21,840 --> 10:17:25,840
If you wanna feel free to play it, I think everyone will love it anyway.

5226
10:17:25,840 --> 10:17:30,840
Yeah, I think maybe the odds of me doing endurance runescape tomorrow are...

5227
10:17:31,840 --> 10:17:33,840
Not quite there, not quite there.

5228
10:17:33,840 --> 10:17:36,840
Well, not feeling like it, to be honest, not feeling like it.

5229
10:17:36,840 --> 10:17:38,840
Where are you, 9 million xp?

5230
10:17:38,840 --> 10:17:40,840
Well, I'm 7 million xp, get wrecked.

5231
10:17:42,840 --> 10:17:43,840
Wah.

5232
10:17:43,840 --> 10:17:47,840
I'm surprised there's not a faster way of doing cooking.

5233
10:17:47,840 --> 10:17:50,840
Is there really no faster way than wine?

5234
10:17:50,840 --> 10:17:53,840
Or is the burn rate too high on items?

5235
10:17:53,840 --> 10:17:54,840
Must be.

5236
10:17:55,840 --> 10:17:56,840
Mmm.

5237
10:17:56,840 --> 10:17:57,840
Mmm.

5238
10:17:57,840 --> 10:17:59,840
Shock and behavior.

5239
10:17:59,840 --> 10:18:04,840
I like hearing you play Belcher on the background, it helps me finish a bit.

5240
10:18:04,840 --> 10:18:06,840
What? It helps me finish it.

5241
10:18:06,840 --> 10:18:10,840
No, it helped me finish that bit for you yesterday.

5242
10:18:10,840 --> 10:18:12,840
What?

5243
10:18:12,840 --> 10:18:19,840
I like hearing you play Belcher on the background, it helped me finish that bit for you yesterday.

5244
10:18:19,840 --> 10:18:21,840
A meme? A meme?

5245
10:18:24,840 --> 10:18:25,840
The...

5246
10:18:25,840 --> 10:18:29,840
Oh, I commissioned myself pregnant, did I say that yet?

5247
10:18:32,840 --> 10:18:34,840
There's a faster way, but it's very quick and...

5248
10:18:34,840 --> 10:18:35,840
Oh, okay, okay.

5249
10:18:38,840 --> 10:18:40,840
Hearing her in the background will do them work.

5250
10:18:40,840 --> 10:18:42,840
Makes it less insufferable?

5251
10:18:42,840 --> 10:18:44,840
Yeah, you like that little Scotch accent?

5252
10:18:44,840 --> 10:18:48,840
Mmm, yes, you love this voice in your ears while you work away.

5253
10:18:48,840 --> 10:18:50,840
Mmm, that's right.

5254
10:18:50,840 --> 10:18:55,840
Do the most menial tasks while your boss makes a dollar and you make a dime

5255
10:18:55,840 --> 10:18:58,840
and that's why you take a fat shite on company time.

5256
10:18:58,840 --> 10:19:00,840
Oh, man.

5257
10:19:00,840 --> 10:19:01,840
No, the art bit.

5258
10:19:01,840 --> 10:19:03,840
Congrats on finding the game pregnant.

5259
10:19:03,840 --> 10:19:05,840
Thank you, it was really hard.

5260
10:19:05,840 --> 10:19:08,840
You know, the lights were off, there was a lot of reef lens,

5261
10:19:08,840 --> 10:19:11,840
there was a lot of slippery wet tentacles.

5262
10:19:11,840 --> 10:19:15,840
I'm going left and right, but hey, I commissioned it.

5263
10:19:15,840 --> 10:19:20,840
It's two weeks to get here, we'll write the script together, how outrageous.

5264
10:19:20,840 --> 10:19:25,840
The artist was actually a bit worried about me getting in trouble with YouTube for it,

5265
10:19:25,840 --> 10:19:29,840
but I'm like, I'm pretty sure YouTube doesn't ban pregnant people.

5266
10:19:29,840 --> 10:19:33,840
It's just me being like, oh, I can't wait to meet you little reef lens.

5267
10:19:33,840 --> 10:19:39,840
I'm going to be like, I've named you and you're going to be my baby boy

5268
10:19:39,840 --> 10:19:43,840
and I'm going to say all the exciting things that I...

5269
10:19:43,840 --> 10:19:46,840
I'm going to talk to you about your grandparents.

5270
10:19:46,840 --> 10:19:50,840
Me, Mon, Paul, I'm going to tell you that they're gamers

5271
10:19:50,840 --> 10:19:53,840
and I'm a gamer and I hope you might be a gamer too

5272
10:19:53,840 --> 10:19:57,840
and I'll show you all the fun things and I'll never be cruel about your hobbies.

5273
10:19:57,840 --> 10:20:00,840
I can't wait for you to share your hobbies with me.

5274
10:20:00,840 --> 10:20:03,840
It's now illegal to be pregnant on YouTube.

5275
10:20:03,840 --> 10:20:05,840
It was really hard.

5276
10:20:05,840 --> 10:20:06,840
What was us?

5277
10:20:06,840 --> 10:20:07,840
Exactly.

5278
10:20:07,840 --> 10:20:10,840
The baby and the father, both me for overall.

5279
10:20:10,840 --> 10:20:12,840
Getting pregnant, sure, but how could you be pregnant?

5280
10:20:12,840 --> 10:20:16,840
I think just because of how ridiculous YouTube is being right now,

5281
10:20:16,840 --> 10:20:20,840
they need to come out and say that your licking isn't allowed anymore

5282
10:20:20,840 --> 10:20:23,840
or they need to take a step back and be like,

5283
10:20:23,840 --> 10:20:26,840
look, women can breathe again in a three-deal

5284
10:20:26,840 --> 10:20:29,840
because it's getting a bit ridiculous.

5285
10:20:29,840 --> 10:20:31,840
You think you'll get away with that?

5286
10:20:31,840 --> 10:20:35,840
Well, I had a really good short made about ear licking

5287
10:20:35,840 --> 10:20:37,840
and I think it would...

5288
10:20:37,840 --> 10:20:39,840
Oh man, this is going to do numbers.

5289
10:20:39,840 --> 10:20:41,840
I thought it was going to do really well

5290
10:20:41,840 --> 10:20:42,840
but I'm too scared to upload it

5291
10:20:42,840 --> 10:20:44,840
because I've currently got a warning on the channel

5292
10:20:44,840 --> 10:20:47,840
and I'm like, hmm.

5293
10:20:47,840 --> 10:20:49,840
And I want to re-upload the clapping one

5294
10:20:49,840 --> 10:20:51,840
but like cut out the breathing section

5295
10:20:51,840 --> 10:20:53,840
where I breathed in the ear basically

5296
10:20:53,840 --> 10:20:57,840
because everything before the ten-minute mark was fine

5297
10:20:57,840 --> 10:21:00,840
but after the ten-minute mark, which was the inner ear breathing,

5298
10:21:00,840 --> 10:21:01,840
that's when they pulled it off.

5299
10:21:01,840 --> 10:21:03,840
They're like, that's what violated the terms of service

5300
10:21:03,840 --> 10:21:06,840
and I'm like, okay then.

5301
10:21:07,840 --> 10:21:12,840
So I might just cut off the end and re-upload it

5302
10:21:12,840 --> 10:21:18,840
and at a later date, like once the 90-day punishment is up.

5303
10:21:18,840 --> 10:21:20,840
So there's like another 80 days on the punishment.

5304
10:21:20,840 --> 10:21:22,840
They are not kidding around.

5305
10:21:22,840 --> 10:21:25,840
Three months punishment for like...

5306
10:21:25,840 --> 10:21:28,840
I mean, I get that they can't moderate everything all at once

5307
10:21:28,840 --> 10:21:33,840
because they're like, how insanely busy the website is both.

5308
10:21:33,840 --> 10:21:34,840
I was kind of worried about the same thing

5309
10:21:34,840 --> 10:21:36,840
before I posted the fan art to Twitter.

5310
10:21:36,840 --> 10:21:37,840
Hey, what are you trying to do?

5311
10:21:37,840 --> 10:21:38,840
You want to meet me cry again?

5312
10:21:38,840 --> 10:21:39,840
Yum.

5313
10:21:41,840 --> 10:21:42,840
Stop breathing, woman.

5314
10:21:42,840 --> 10:21:44,840
You're taking up all the MasterCard.

5315
10:21:44,840 --> 10:21:46,840
My favorite thing is like, I consent.

5316
10:21:46,840 --> 10:21:48,840
I consent and then it's a picture of MasterCard

5317
10:21:48,840 --> 10:21:53,840
and it's like, but do I consent or something like that?

5318
10:21:53,840 --> 10:21:55,840
If it works, use it as a 3K video.

5319
10:21:55,840 --> 10:21:56,840
Oh no.

5320
10:21:56,840 --> 10:22:01,840
So the next video upload is going to be a collab

5321
10:22:01,840 --> 10:22:03,840
and then it's going to be the 3K

5322
10:22:03,840 --> 10:22:06,840
and then it's going to be a collab and then it's the 4K.

5323
10:22:06,840 --> 10:22:08,840
I'm doing it like that because I've got a few people

5324
10:22:08,840 --> 10:22:11,840
waiting on content.

5325
10:22:11,840 --> 10:22:13,840
They've been waiting patiently for me.

5326
10:22:13,840 --> 10:22:15,840
And I'm taking my sweet time.

5327
10:22:15,840 --> 10:22:17,840
Is there someone you forgot to ask?

5328
10:22:17,840 --> 10:22:19,840
Yes, that's it.

5329
10:22:19,840 --> 10:22:24,840
The next 3K audio I think might be...

5330
10:22:24,840 --> 10:22:26,840
I don't know.

5331
10:22:27,840 --> 10:22:31,840
I've edited a burping audio, which is disgusting,

5332
10:22:31,840 --> 10:22:33,840
but I'm scared to upload it because I'm like,

5333
10:22:33,840 --> 10:22:35,840
well, I had the audacity to burp in the ear

5334
10:22:35,840 --> 10:22:37,840
as YouTube is going to be like,

5335
10:22:37,840 --> 10:22:38,840
ah, that's breathing in the mic.

5336
10:22:38,840 --> 10:22:41,840
Here's a strike and you can't stream for a week.

5337
10:22:41,840 --> 10:22:45,840
The rules are getting so arbitrary.

5338
10:22:45,840 --> 10:22:46,840
Arbiter.

5339
10:22:46,840 --> 10:22:48,840
As I said, we're playing Halo right now.

5340
10:22:48,840 --> 10:22:49,840
Arbiter.

5341
10:22:51,840 --> 10:22:53,840
I only wanted to ease your job.

5342
10:22:53,840 --> 10:22:55,840
I guess you like it though.

5343
10:22:55,840 --> 10:22:56,840
What is it?

5344
10:22:56,840 --> 10:22:58,840
It's an easy job.

5345
10:22:58,840 --> 10:23:00,840
What is this?

5346
10:23:02,840 --> 10:23:06,840
Stony is going to filter her audience before we do it.

5347
10:23:06,840 --> 10:23:08,840
I already did it.

5348
10:23:08,840 --> 10:23:10,840
I think I've told you guys this plan before,

5349
10:23:10,840 --> 10:23:13,840
but because I'll upload ASMR role-play videos,

5350
10:23:13,840 --> 10:23:18,840
no one is going to watch the live stream unless it's ASMR.

5351
10:23:18,840 --> 10:23:20,840
Because I only do ASMR once a week.

5352
10:23:20,840 --> 10:23:24,840
We're naturally more of a tight-knit community,

5353
10:23:24,840 --> 10:23:28,840
which I prefer because I feel like I can see what I want to do.

5354
10:23:29,840 --> 10:23:33,840
Whereas if I had a lot of eyes on me and I'm like,

5355
10:23:33,840 --> 10:23:35,840
I'm not sure you guys are like,

5356
10:23:35,840 --> 10:23:37,840
riefling rieflings, you know?

5357
10:23:37,840 --> 10:23:40,840
And it makes me nervous and it makes me scared.

5358
10:23:40,840 --> 10:23:43,840
But, you know, all as good as the,

5359
10:23:43,840 --> 10:23:47,840
all as good for the Dutch people.

5360
10:23:47,840 --> 10:23:49,840
Get fillered, get fillered, get fillered.

5361
10:23:49,840 --> 10:23:52,840
And the holding it in one didn't get any flak.

5362
10:23:52,840 --> 10:23:53,840
Nope.

5363
10:23:53,840 --> 10:23:57,840
It was limited ads and I on a whim sent a judgement thing.

5364
10:23:57,840 --> 10:24:00,840
And they let me put ads on, please let me hold it.

5365
10:24:00,840 --> 10:24:03,840
And I literally say, let me hold your Pintas at one point.

5366
10:24:03,840 --> 10:24:05,840
And they're like, yeah, that's fine.

5367
10:24:05,840 --> 10:24:09,840
But me breathing in the mic is a violation of terms of service.

5368
10:24:09,840 --> 10:24:13,840
So they have straight up, they have updated the terms of service.

5369
10:24:13,840 --> 10:24:18,840
And they are not, they've not publicly said it.

5370
10:24:18,840 --> 10:24:23,840
And it's resulted in people's entire channels like being deleted.

5371
10:24:23,840 --> 10:24:26,840
Like ASMR people's channels is like the straight up deleted.

5372
10:24:26,840 --> 10:24:29,840
Nay, nay warning, just a,

5373
10:24:29,840 --> 10:24:31,840
sorry my stomach just farted if you heard that.

5374
10:24:31,840 --> 10:24:33,840
Nay warning, nay none.

5375
10:24:37,840 --> 10:24:38,840
I'm still a tight note,

5376
10:24:38,840 --> 10:24:40,840
but you're already getting close to the 10K subscribers.

5377
10:24:40,840 --> 10:24:45,840
I need to test if my iPhone can work in the bathroom then.

5378
10:24:45,840 --> 10:24:49,840
Because I need to do my 10K special bath stream.

5379
10:24:50,840 --> 10:24:53,840
Doing ASMR in the bath.

5380
10:24:53,840 --> 10:24:56,840
Let's turn it into a bubble bath.

5381
10:24:58,840 --> 10:25:01,840
You say that, but the thing I'm looking forward to the most is the hypno stuff.

5382
10:25:01,840 --> 10:25:05,840
It's bizarre, hypno stuff is perfectly fine on YouTube.

5383
10:25:05,840 --> 10:25:10,840
I'm literally gonna reprogram your brain temporarily to forget your name

5384
10:25:10,840 --> 10:25:14,840
and respond to refling and YouTube's like, yeah, that's fine.

5385
10:25:14,840 --> 10:25:17,840
But breathing in your ear every just...

5386
10:25:20,840 --> 10:25:24,840
Even if I'm watching it two, three times speed.

5387
10:25:24,840 --> 10:25:27,840
Oh my God, I must yap so fast on times three speed.

5388
10:25:27,840 --> 10:25:29,840
It's not even real.

5389
10:25:29,840 --> 10:25:30,840
It's fine, just don't breathe.

5390
10:25:30,840 --> 10:25:31,840
Just don't breathe.

5391
10:25:31,840 --> 10:25:33,840
Five hands, just don't breathe.

5392
10:25:33,840 --> 10:25:36,840
I love the way I don't breathe.

5393
10:25:36,840 --> 10:25:38,840
Yes, baby.

5394
10:25:38,840 --> 10:25:41,840
No matter what I need, I need breath.

5395
10:25:41,840 --> 10:25:43,840
Right, once this pops,

5396
10:25:43,840 --> 10:25:48,840
I'm redirecting into lovely jubbly

5397
10:25:50,840 --> 10:25:51,840
Let's see.

5398
10:25:54,840 --> 10:25:55,840
I'm just checking everything's fine.

5399
10:25:55,840 --> 10:25:57,840
Everything looks good to me.

5400
10:26:01,840 --> 10:26:04,840
I got some shorts coming out soon, the girly.

5401
10:26:04,840 --> 10:26:06,840
Which I'm excited about.

5402
10:26:06,840 --> 10:26:07,840
I think I've already said that, sorry.

5403
10:26:07,840 --> 10:26:09,840
I always repeat myself because I keep forgetting.

5404
10:26:11,840 --> 10:26:15,840
I don't think the algorithm really uses what a creepling is.

5405
10:26:15,840 --> 10:26:17,840
Just have some rest.

5406
10:26:17,840 --> 10:26:18,840
I think you need it though.

5407
10:26:18,840 --> 10:26:20,840
Okay, I'm going to sleep after this.

5408
10:26:20,840 --> 10:26:22,840
I'm going to get a shower because I literally was sweating so much

5409
10:26:22,840 --> 10:26:26,840
when I had my little cry over at John Wick.

5410
10:26:26,840 --> 10:26:29,840
And then I'm going to go sleep.

5411
10:26:29,840 --> 10:26:36,840
I'm going to wake up and I'm going to edit an audio of AC and Emmy together

5412
10:26:36,840 --> 10:26:40,840
and pray that they both know what whispering is.

5413
10:26:40,840 --> 10:26:45,840
Not naming names, but I've sent a few scripts away.

5414
10:26:45,840 --> 10:26:47,840
And when I send a script,

5415
10:26:47,840 --> 10:26:50,840
I put in big bold letters and highlight it in red

5416
10:26:50,840 --> 10:26:53,840
and it says, please whisper through the whole script.

5417
10:26:53,840 --> 10:26:57,840
And sometimes I get back soft spoken or talking.

5418
10:26:57,840 --> 10:27:01,840
And it's actually very common.

5419
10:27:01,840 --> 10:27:03,840
It's not just like the viewer who I'm collabing with.

5420
10:27:03,840 --> 10:27:04,840
It's like really common.

5421
10:27:04,840 --> 10:27:06,840
I'll put it in big letters, please whisper.

5422
10:27:06,840 --> 10:27:10,840
And I'm like, so this is talking.

5423
10:27:11,840 --> 10:27:13,840
This is soft spoken.

5424
10:27:13,840 --> 10:27:18,840
You can still hear the thim in my voice while I'm speaking gentler to you.

5425
10:27:18,840 --> 10:27:20,840
I'm whispering.

5426
10:27:20,840 --> 10:27:22,840
Wow!

5427
10:27:22,840 --> 10:27:24,840
We got 93.

5428
10:27:24,840 --> 10:27:27,840
But whispering is when there's no thim to your voice at all.

5429
10:27:27,840 --> 10:27:28,840
There's no...

5430
10:27:28,840 --> 10:27:29,840
Uh-huh.

5431
10:27:29,840 --> 10:27:31,840
Okay.

5432
10:27:31,840 --> 10:27:32,840
Yes, but now you know.

5433
10:27:32,840 --> 10:27:34,840
Okay, 93.

5434
10:27:34,840 --> 10:27:35,840
Wait.

5435
10:27:35,840 --> 10:27:37,840
Why are you like that?

5436
10:27:37,840 --> 10:27:39,840
Oh fuck, there's not so much.

5437
10:27:39,840 --> 10:27:40,840
I'll just hide it.

5438
10:27:40,840 --> 10:27:42,840
I messed up so much.

5439
10:27:42,840 --> 10:27:45,840
I'll fix it tomorrow.

5440
10:27:45,840 --> 10:27:47,840
I'll fix it tomorrow.

5441
10:27:47,840 --> 10:27:48,840
Please forgive me, right?

5442
10:27:48,840 --> 10:27:49,840
What were we on?

5443
10:27:49,840 --> 10:27:50,840
93.

5444
10:27:50,840 --> 10:27:52,840
So, what is it?

5445
10:27:52,840 --> 10:27:56,840
Next level is just shy of 8 million XP.

5446
10:27:56,840 --> 10:27:57,840
That's quite a lot.

5447
10:27:57,840 --> 10:27:59,840
I'm not gonna lie.

5448
10:27:59,840 --> 10:28:00,840
I'm not going to lie.

5449
10:28:00,840 --> 10:28:01,840
Congrats, Momay.

5450
10:28:01,840 --> 10:28:04,840
You guys are gonna finish cooking faster than I am.

5451
10:28:04,840 --> 10:28:05,840
Congrats.

5452
10:28:05,840 --> 10:28:06,840
Now go to sleep.

5453
10:28:06,840 --> 10:28:07,840
Soon, soon, soon.

5454
10:28:07,840 --> 10:28:08,840
Like right now?

5455
10:28:08,840 --> 10:28:09,840
Right this side?

5456
10:28:10,840 --> 10:28:11,840
Okay.

5457
10:28:11,840 --> 10:28:13,840
Hopefully my microphone...

5458
10:28:13,840 --> 10:28:15,840
I'm actually gonna completely reset it tomorrow

5459
10:28:15,840 --> 10:28:17,840
because I don't know why it's lagging, but...

5460
10:28:17,840 --> 10:28:19,840
It is...

5461
10:28:19,840 --> 10:28:21,840
I'm just gonna ventriloquist

5462
10:28:21,840 --> 10:28:25,840
so my model doesn't react to my mouth at all.

5463
10:28:25,840 --> 10:28:28,840
Actually, I don't even think I've set up my model

5464
10:28:28,840 --> 10:28:31,840
to react to the microphone, which I should.

5465
10:28:31,840 --> 10:28:34,840
You reach your level, so now you have to change the parameter.

5466
10:28:34,840 --> 10:28:35,840
Exactly.

5467
10:28:35,840 --> 10:28:37,840
That's just how it works.

5468
10:28:37,840 --> 10:28:38,840
It just works.

5469
10:28:38,840 --> 10:28:40,840
Call me Todd Howard, because it just works.

5470
10:28:40,840 --> 10:28:41,840
Right.

5471
10:28:41,840 --> 10:28:43,840
I will actually go...

5472
10:28:43,840 --> 10:28:44,840
I'm gonna redirect into his work

5473
10:28:44,840 --> 10:28:46,840
because I don't want to waste the opportunity

5474
10:28:46,840 --> 10:28:48,840
in case she has had enough.

5475
10:28:48,840 --> 10:28:49,840
Right.

5476
10:28:49,840 --> 10:28:51,840
Thank you all so much for keeping me company

5477
10:28:51,840 --> 10:28:54,840
through my absolute distraughtness.

5478
10:28:54,840 --> 10:28:56,840
We're going to Night Night Cooking on this account too,

5479
10:28:56,840 --> 10:28:58,840
but I don't want it to be my untrimmed.

5480
10:28:58,840 --> 10:28:59,840
I have no idea what that means.

5481
10:28:59,840 --> 10:29:00,840
But good luck.

5482
10:29:00,840 --> 10:29:01,840
Yes.

5483
10:29:01,840 --> 10:29:04,840
Thank you so, so much for hanging out with me.

5484
10:29:04,840 --> 10:29:05,840
I appreciate it.

5485
10:29:05,840 --> 10:29:07,840
Thank you for anyone that joined me in world

5486
10:29:07,840 --> 10:29:08,840
3A free play.

5487
10:29:08,840 --> 10:29:10,840
I do do the 3A.

5488
10:29:10,840 --> 10:29:12,840
Unfortunately, I did recommend buying membership.

5489
10:29:12,840 --> 10:29:15,840
I didn't understand that I didn't need membership to do cooking.

5490
10:29:15,840 --> 10:29:16,840
That was on me.

5491
10:29:16,840 --> 10:29:18,840
I was being a silly Billy,

5492
10:29:18,840 --> 10:29:22,840
not thinking with my head and thinking with my willy.

5493
10:29:22,840 --> 10:29:23,840
Thank you.

5494
10:29:23,840 --> 10:29:28,840
Thank you so much for comforting me

5495
10:29:28,840 --> 10:29:31,840
during the absolute pain that is drawn wick.

5496
10:29:31,840 --> 10:29:34,840
Whoever said it is an action thing,

5497
10:29:34,840 --> 10:29:38,840
liar, distraught, cannot comprehend.

5498
10:29:38,840 --> 10:29:39,840
Okay.

5499
10:29:39,840 --> 10:29:43,840
Cannot comprehend how distraught that movie has made me.

5500
10:29:43,840 --> 10:29:45,840
How much did she cry?

5501
10:29:45,840 --> 10:29:47,840
If you want to skip her back a little bit,

5502
10:29:47,840 --> 10:29:51,840
feel free to listen to the moment where I realize that

5503
10:29:51,840 --> 10:29:57,840
John Wick 5 is most likely a prequel and not a sequel

5504
10:29:57,840 --> 10:30:01,840
because I was aware that John Wick 5 is a thing

5505
10:30:01,840 --> 10:30:04,840
and I was like ha ha ha ha ha,

5506
10:30:04,840 --> 10:30:08,840
but the ha ha ha ha ha part backfired horrendously.

5507
10:30:08,840 --> 10:30:10,840
But yes, thank you so so much.

5508
10:30:10,840 --> 10:30:12,840
I'm going to redirect into this error.

5509
10:30:12,840 --> 10:30:13,840
She's currently playing League of Legends,

5510
10:30:13,840 --> 10:30:15,840
so I'm sorry to expose you to that.

5511
10:30:15,840 --> 10:30:17,840
I don't know what's so bad about League.

5512
10:30:17,840 --> 10:30:18,840
I've never played it,

5513
10:30:18,840 --> 10:30:21,840
but I guess it's a bad game question mark

5514
10:30:21,840 --> 10:30:24,840
because everyone seems to complain about it question mark.

5515
10:30:24,840 --> 10:30:25,840
I guess it's like Apex.

5516
10:30:25,840 --> 10:30:26,840
Everyone's like,

5517
10:30:26,840 --> 10:30:27,840
I don't want to see Apex.

5518
10:30:27,840 --> 10:30:28,840
I don't want to see Minecraft.

5519
10:30:28,840 --> 10:30:31,840
And I was like, well, I jumped on Microsoft for you.

5520
10:30:31,840 --> 10:30:33,840
So how about you make a salt,

5521
10:30:33,840 --> 10:30:35,840
let me make a salt you.

5522
10:30:35,840 --> 10:30:37,840
That's absolutely awful.

5523
10:30:37,840 --> 10:30:38,840
I'm going to go to sleep.

5524
10:30:38,840 --> 10:30:40,840
No, I'm going to shower.

5525
10:30:40,840 --> 10:30:41,840
I'm going to go to sleep.

5526
10:30:41,840 --> 10:30:43,840
I've literally cried through all of the movies.

5527
10:30:43,840 --> 10:30:45,840
I think the third one, what,

5528
10:30:45,840 --> 10:30:46,840
maybe I peered up a little.

5529
10:30:46,840 --> 10:30:48,840
Was the third one the only one I didn't really greet at?

5530
10:30:48,840 --> 10:30:50,840
It looks like Azura's ending.

5531
10:30:50,840 --> 10:30:52,840
Oh, well, I'm glad I caught that.

5532
10:30:52,840 --> 10:30:54,840
Hold on.

5533
10:30:54,840 --> 10:30:56,840
Hold on, Positunes.

5534
10:30:56,840 --> 10:30:57,840
Hold on.

5535
10:30:57,840 --> 10:31:02,840
We need to raid into someone.

5536
10:31:02,840 --> 10:31:04,840
I'm going to shove you on Yumi plus.

5537
10:31:04,840 --> 10:31:05,840
I'm going to go ask Yumi plus.

5538
10:31:05,840 --> 10:31:07,840
Are you still playing Yumi?

5539
10:31:07,840 --> 10:31:08,840
Yumi, are you still playing?

5540
10:31:08,840 --> 10:31:09,840
What?

5541
10:31:09,840 --> 10:31:13,840
Oh, my Yumi's went offline.

5542
10:31:13,840 --> 10:31:16,840
I, me, is coming up.

5543
10:31:16,840 --> 10:31:17,840
Right.

5544
10:31:17,840 --> 10:31:18,840
I, me, is.

5545
10:31:18,840 --> 10:31:19,840
If Azura's going offline.

5546
10:31:19,840 --> 10:31:20,840
Yeah, she is.

5547
10:31:20,840 --> 10:31:21,840
Okay.

5548
10:31:21,840 --> 10:31:22,840
Thank you so so much for the little reeflings.

5549
10:31:22,840 --> 10:31:23,840
I'll see you tomorrow.

5550
10:31:23,840 --> 10:31:24,840
Please do not be surprised

5551
10:31:24,840 --> 10:31:25,840
if I'm not doing an endurance runescape tomorrow.

5552
10:31:25,840 --> 10:31:27,840
I will see how I feel when I wake up

5553
10:31:27,840 --> 10:31:32,840
because emotionally distraught as I said.

5554
10:31:32,840 --> 10:31:34,840
We might swap to Beltral

5555
10:31:34,840 --> 10:31:35,840
because I'm absolutely addicted

5556
10:31:35,840 --> 10:31:37,840
and I love it and I have so much fun

5557
10:31:37,840 --> 10:31:39,840
with you guys telling me what's up.

5558
10:31:39,840 --> 10:31:42,840
So thank you so, so much.

5559
10:31:42,840 --> 10:31:44,840
I will talk to you tomorrow.

5560
10:31:44,840 --> 10:31:45,840
Please look after yourself.

5561
10:31:45,840 --> 10:31:46,840
Please hydrate.

5562
10:31:46,840 --> 10:31:47,840
Please shower.

5563
10:31:47,840 --> 10:31:48,840
Please do not strain

5564
10:31:48,840 --> 10:31:50,840
when you go for a poopy

5565
10:31:50,840 --> 10:31:51,840
or you'll hurt your butthole

5566
10:31:51,840 --> 10:31:54,840
and hydrate and have more fiber

5567
10:31:54,840 --> 10:31:56,840
that'll help with your little poopies.

5568
10:31:56,840 --> 10:31:59,840
I don't know why I'm doing that.

5569
10:31:59,840 --> 10:32:00,840
Why am I like this?

5570
10:32:00,840 --> 10:32:02,840
But yes, I love you very much, reefling.

5571
10:32:02,840 --> 10:32:03,840
Please do look after yourself.

5572
10:32:03,840 --> 10:32:04,840
I will see you tomorrow

5573
10:32:04,840 --> 10:32:07,840
and I'm going to redirect into Amy from Yumi Plus.

5574
10:32:07,840 --> 10:32:11,840
As always, when I redirect into another strummer,

5575
10:32:11,840 --> 10:32:14,840
they are not always at the same comfortability as me.

5576
10:32:14,840 --> 10:32:15,840
Let's go.

5577
10:32:15,840 --> 10:32:16,840
Okay.

5578
10:32:16,840 --> 10:32:17,840
I will see you tomorrow

5579
10:32:17,840 --> 10:32:19,840
for most likely Balletro, okay?

5580
10:32:19,840 --> 10:32:20,840
I said it.

5581
10:32:20,840 --> 10:32:21,840
I said it, okay?

5582
10:32:21,840 --> 10:32:23,840
I mean, although we are actually

5583
10:32:23,840 --> 10:32:26,840
like what, 11 hours away?

5584
10:32:26,840 --> 10:32:27,840
Soon, soon.

5585
10:32:27,840 --> 10:32:28,840
Right.

5586
10:32:28,840 --> 10:32:29,840
I will see you at Giffy Givers tomorrow.

5587
10:32:29,840 --> 10:32:30,840
Please hydrate.

5588
10:32:30,840 --> 10:32:31,840
Please get snagged.

5589
10:32:31,840 --> 10:32:32,840
Please brush your teeth before bed

5590
10:32:32,840 --> 10:32:34,840
if you're going to sleep with me at the same time.

5591
10:32:34,840 --> 10:32:39,840
And then we'll see what happens tomorrow, okay?

5592
10:32:39,840 --> 10:32:40,840
Bye-bye.

5593
10:32:40,840 --> 10:32:41,840
Bye, reeflings.

5594
10:32:41,840 --> 10:32:43,840
Please look after yourself, okay?

5595
10:32:43,840 --> 10:32:44,840
Bye-bye.
