together all right i have the very first poll for you now don't be embarrassed if you get anything

53
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:21,680

54
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:32,960
just to guess okay start a poll now the question is how many days in a month is a woman fertile

55
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:40,000
so how many how many days in a month can she get pregnant okay again there's no wrong questions

56
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,760
just there's no wrong answers um just uneducated ones and it's not your fault if you're uneducated

57
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,200
in anything the school system is not set up for the most successful if you're any sort of way

58
00:06:53,200 --> 00:07:00,720
so please feel free to use the chat how often sorry how often how many days in a month do you

59
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,680
think a woman is fertile please again there is no wrong answers just uneducated ones okay

60
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,480
just uneducated one do not be embarrassed if you get anything wrong who said oh we've got a question

61
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:23,920
thank you for raising your hand are the three holes real um yes it is uh there's the p-hole the urea

62
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:32,480
there is the um vaginal entrance hole and then there is the anus for release of stool yes that's

63
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:38,640
a good question thank you thank you okay we're just getting some some of the results back some of

64
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:45,360
the results back okay we're going to end the poll results thank you everyone for participating in

65
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:55,600
that poll i am about to blow your mind little reeflings because c is actually not correct no a

66
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:03,760
woman is not fertile uh as soon as as soon as a woman experiences um periods no she's not

67
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:12,880
fertile at all moments but the next uh voted result b is seven days in a month she is fertile no

68
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:25,040
reeflings no a woman technically at a maximum per month at 48 days has a chance to get pregnant

69
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:34,640
now where do we even start with the reproductive system of a woman it is insanity no no please

70
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:42,400
don't worry please do not worry at all i will be taking any brian not now i'm teaching i will

71
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:48,000
respond to anything at the end of the uh the lecture thank you please do not blurt out in the middle

72
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,240
of class about your uh deadlift bench press thank you thank you reeflings keep it to yourself

73
00:08:52,240 --> 00:09:01,120
also and reply after soon so technically during the monthly cycle of a woman okay there you know

74
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,120
when when a woman goes oh i'm ovulating you know how she can tell a certain type of slain

75
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,920
evacuates okay that's how a woman can tell she's ovulating she can only get pregnant

76
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:21,120
now i've been i've been very generous to say two days because on a technicality yes but the actual

77
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:28,400
egg that is ready to be fertilized before it falls too far from the fallopian tube down into the

78
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:36,320
the womb area 20 you've pretty much got 24 hours so you know when people say it's really hard to

79
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,160
conceive and they've been at it for ages because they're looking for the tiniest slither of a window

80
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,320
okay and and there's a bit of a misconception that the first time you ever have coyotes that

81
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,080
you cannot get pregnant this is a misconception please do not be embarrassed if you thought

82
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,280
these things the reason i am bringing it up is because that's what people think and i want to

83
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,720
discuss it and um you know give you so you can get pregnant the very first time uh you quote you

84
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:13,280
have quite us um but um the reason why i'm giving you a two-day time frame to impregnate your uh

85
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:22,640
consenting adult is because sperm can stay alive in the womb for over five days so in theory

86
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:31,360
you could do the dance with someone okay and they are they're not in their fertile period

87
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,120
so they cannot get pregnant but then the egg moves into position causing them the ability

88
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:44,640
to get fertile from your few-day old sperm conception is an absolute miracle even happens

89
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:52,960
in the first place it is a fantastically uh unique thing um so again so this is the tight

90
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,880
clam syndrome one point to here and then this is where the cervix begins and the eggs come from

91
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:06,080
this ovary and it gets grabbed and it goes down the fallopian tube and into the cervix and if

92
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,240
if you're lucky so this is you many years ago however old you are this is you right now because

93
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,920
you were the first one to reach the egg so the first person to reach the egg wins everyone else

94
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:27,520
dies perishes and fire and no um and then there you go so this is where the tight clam entrance

95
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:36,640
is and then there's a little um length chamber now in hand you don't actually access the inner

96
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,000
cervix this would be incredibly painful you do not access this area but the sperm you

97
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,360
access the area and they swim up and then they touch the egg and then it's you it's fantastic

98
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:56,160
so yeah uh you've got 24 you're 24 hours to impregnate a woman monthly that is why when

99
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,400
people say they have a one-night stand and then a baby is the result of that oh my god you're so

100
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:12,640
unlucky that's really terrible but it was your choice not to wrap it so consequences of your

101
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:22,880
actions you know how it is okay next topic dun dun dun dun dun dun dun seeds glorious seeds

102
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,720

103
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,240
are my real seed collections as you can see you have a lot of samples drying before i put them away

104
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:42,080
in jars um oh we have a question thank you for raising your hand refilling is that a drawing

132
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:01,200
but can anyone tell me any type of seed dispersal because there are five types of speed seed

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:36,160
it oh i'm looking i'm looking uh put dispersal that goes under animal very good very good

145
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,480
we have water dispersal fantastic that's four out of five there's one more type of dispersal

146
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:49,600
we have yet to unlock we have animal water ballistic wind don't worry pollination from insects

147
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,200
and animals now you're going you're going steps ahead you're going steps ahead so pollination is

148
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:03,280
how the seed is created the ovum and stem from the flowers come together oh we have falling fruits

149
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,920
well done we have discovered all five kinds of seed dispersal fantastic reeflings the delay is

150
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:16,080
20 seconds is it are you being for real right now why the fuck is it the least 30 seconds hold on

151
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:24,080
pause the role play is the dis is it 20 why is it 20 seconds are you serious setting

152
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,120
hold on hold on can i change this live or is it not gonna let me do it live

153
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,840
dinner karmia

154
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:41,920
why is it not ultra oh my god i can't change it because we're in the middle of a freaking stream

155
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:48,000
are you serious i can't change it midstream you're right we are on a 22nd delay why are we on a

156
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,680
22nd delay it's never been a 22nd delay before oh for goodness sake okay well anyway fantastic work

157
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:06,080
yes that is the five kinds of seed dispersal so gravity can be a type of a i think it's a sycamore

158
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,880
plant is that twirly one that comes down i'm so sorry i apologize i i don't know why it's not

159
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:25,440
on reactive wind example is a dandelion okay okay ballistic is an okra okra i probably

160
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:33,040
saying it horrifically wrong but basically it shoots out and it goes like okay and then water

161
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,560
is coconut did you know coconuts float and they were perfect for floating in the ocean

162
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,120
and coconuts are very unique thing i could probably go into a big massive rant about the

163
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,120
uniqueness of seeds and plants that's for another day and then an example of animals

164
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:54,560
dispersing seeds is an apple you eat the apple you eat the seed and then it's fantastic everyone's

165
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:00,080
having a good time thank you thank you and then this is my actual seed collection um i pick up seeds

166
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:06,160
on a wild walk i just go on a walk i grab seeds i have i'm gonna confess here um i have gone into

167
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,000
people's gardens just to grab seeds off of their plants and then run off their property again

168
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,600
but like these ones for example are drying out you must have a dry seed sample before you put

169
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,800
them away in these test tube thing uh little tube things or um you risk actually getting mold and

170
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:28,560
stuff like you can see this these tiny little black specks those are the seeds that's how tiny

171
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:35,440
they are in that sample but you can see the stain that the fruit um like the innards of the dispersal

172
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,560
method was i was actually uh i really enjoy seed collection uh unfortunately it's winter so there's

173
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:47,520
like nothing to collect right now um but that's safe this this seed band it look i don't only

174
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,640
steal seeds from flowers okay i steal your seed as well well i'm at it relax i'm doing

175
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:03,680
i'm molly tasking right back to school boom next topic region locked capitalism also known as

176
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:11,680
feudalism now let's just take a yes have you again i'm a cool lecturer so here's the king of the land

177
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:18,080
it goes it's free real estate and then it's michael from vsauce and then it goes or is it

178
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:27,200
vsauce theme plays boom boom now feudalism occurred within the ninth ninth century ninth yes

179
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:36,320
ninth century to the 15th century fantastic stuff it lasted a very long time so first

180
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:43,840
reef links i would like you to imagine not having full access to the world map okay the reason

181
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:51,440
for this is because the globe was the globe was unlockable however um the humanity did not put

182
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,600
enough perk points into transportation yet to unlock globalism so we weren't at that stage we

183
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:06,400
were region locked capitalism which is called feudalism okay um so feudalism is the dominant

184
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:17,520
social system in medieval europe okay where the disgusting nasty disease ridden peasants us were

185
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:26,480
forced into labor on farms right but in the exchange of this labor uh oh let me just read

186
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:33,920
how the the how it's phrased online we're obligated we're obliged to live on the lord's land and give

187
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:43,760
him homage labor and share of the produce notionally in exchange for military protection okay because

188
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,400
people used to pillage and stuff back in them times right and nay one once shanked everyone was

189
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,440
minding their own business nay one once shanks but you don't like the stories and nights nights

190
00:22:53,440 --> 00:23:00,000
are real okay nights are actually a thing that happened okay so if we look at our beloved pyramid

191
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:07,280
um of region locked capitalism um we are the peasants and the serfs we are down here this is

192
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:16,880
us down here we would be telling the soil in the fields producing all of the food um what did i walk

193
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:26,880
into i'm becoming a teacher um so we made all the food in exchange that we could have basically

194
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:35,120
have board and protection from being shanked okay okay um so there's craftsmen there was farmers

195
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,640
and merchants now those were above us that's what we were trying to obtain to be it was not possible

196
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,160
to spawn it it was so hard if you were a peasant and to spawn in and then to become a knight or a

197
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:56,240
battle but with any form of shitty capitalism there's always a high table and the high table

198
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:04,080
tier begins at the nobles and the monarchs and then the pope and the church they are all high tier

199
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:13,040
table and above do not be mistaken okay you ate your homework what do you mean you ate your homework

200
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:22,160
i've not even given you your homework yet shish but yeah um this is a high table and above so nobles

201
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:31,040
monarchs pope and church untouchable to us filthy disgusting leprosy infected no peasants okay okay

202
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:37,360
the pope above the monarch what do you mean the church is above the state hmm oh we have uh

203
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,760
thank you for putting your hand excuse me is first by it's first dream by the way is learning

204
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:48,800
this okay for the channel or is this what monetization oh what oh no you can learn what you want

205
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,120
i ain't here for the money i'm here for the education you're getting educated against your

206
00:24:53,360 --> 00:25:01,840
pop up okay so that is how it used to be you used to get shanked back in the day you'd be

207
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,840
randomly getting stabbed minding your own business so in exchange for safety on someone's land

208
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,200
you would do all the work reap hardly any benefit so this is a really shitty disgusting

209
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,120
version of capitalism unfortunately capitalism kind of popped off today but i do want to note

210
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:29,600
why did feudalism fail does any refling have any idea or inclination why feudalism failed

211
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:37,120
and became old and became outdated that out no longer reflected the society that the world

212
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:43,520
was in hmm can any remember there's no wrong answers it's okay if you actually don't know

213
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:51,120
you are more than welcome to suggest a reason why you think feudalism uh was timed out in the 15th

214
00:25:51,120 --> 00:26:00,240
century um hmm i spelled capitalism wrong damn straight i did there must be always

215
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:10,080
oh thank you we've got corruption and oh okay okay nobility industrial revolution very good

216
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:18,160
french people i like it i like it because of fast travel we're getting there trade yet rise of

217
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:23,200
trade the black plague that did really mess up europe that's a different i did not put that in this

218
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:30,320
lecture because of the rise of the merchant class now what has been identified was the

219
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:40,400
decline of knights and castles because knights were such a prolific enemy to your life they were

220
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,880
such a danger to your life and kind of having knights to order around to execute willy nilly

221
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:55,200
people left and right but because of the falling of castles of kingdoms of locations the decline

222
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:04,080
people started to say hold on a minute i can go do all of this myself and reap a heck of a lot more

223
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:12,080
than what you're willing to give me so uh it did fail so i have hope all i'm saying is that between

224
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,920
the ninth and the fifth oh did i say the eighth it's the ninth century sorry between the ninth and

225
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:22,080
the 15th century six hundred years give or take a new form i'm feeling sick can i go to the nurse

226
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,080
okay you can go to the nurse take the whole pass okay but come back with it when you're finished

227
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:35,120
okay next stage boom topic four since we were looking at a pyramid earlier okay

228
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:43,920
since we're looking at a pyramid we're gonna move on to big boy maslow's hierarchy of needs let's

229
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,080
okay as you can see i'm hiding up my emote that's behind me right now but we're looking at

230
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:58,400
maslow's hierarchy of needs now have you ever felt kaka before okay have you ever felt like you do

231
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:05,760
not belong are the brain worms just winning as these are the questions i have for you stop

232
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,360
don't take your medicine just yet okay don't take your medicine just yet

233
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:19,040
let's get to the bottom huh or the pyramid okay so you can reach the top

234
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:26,560
uh uh uh so let us come up with a problem together and find the solution let's find the solution

235
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:32,640
together to a problem a hypothetical problem so we're gonna take a little little dive into

236
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:42,640
maslow's hierarchy of needs boom all right refling take it away problem strongy i can't

237
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:51,520
ink anymore something's wrong and my lust is gone well we have found our problem worry not

238
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:58,240
i will have you touching yourself in no time let's try out the pyramid method to this thing now don't

239
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:05,600
throw up in my class go it's vomiting face now right go vomiting face thanks brine go i will

240
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:12,160
read at the end okay so we have maslow's hierarchy of needs here okay we have psychological uh

241
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:20,320
psychophysiological needs hey we got there in the end i'll take that we have safety needs

242
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,400
belonging self-esteem and then self-actualization okay so if you cannot ink we're gonna take this

243
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:34,400
problem physiological needs so this is your physical stuff you need your to achieve homeostasis

244
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:40,320
homeostasis is when your body is maintaining yourself fine it feels good it's happy things

245
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:47,680
are good okay so what aren't we achieving together what needs to change dany to tuck you into bed

246
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:53,760
for rest have you rested that is my question for you do i need to feed you are you hungry okay it's

247
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:01,600
first thing in the morning and you're uh getting educated against your will okay um what do you say

248
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,440
but oh thank you for putting your hand up but mummy maslow's hierarchy needs have been showed to be

249
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,720
overly simplistic and not no i don't want to hear it okay i don't want to hear i like maslow i really

250
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,680
like maslow okay do i need to feed you could i could bring you a toothbrush if you didn't brush your

251
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:21,600
teeth in bed i'm not gonna judge no no problem with me i just want your needs to be met because if

252
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:29,440
your needs are met in big old maslow a big abraham maslow said if you have met all your homeostasis

253
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:38,800
needs we get to move up a tier okay we get to move up to your safety needs security safety okay so

254
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:45,360
security can come in a form of different ways okay so i have are you able to socialize well with who

255
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:52,480
you like hold on i'm gonna have to move my big old head where's my moose oh sorry my cursors

256
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,760
having a hold on let me move myself i'm in the way i'll sit on the i'll just camp down here okay

257
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,240
sorry i'm i'm camping in chat um are you able to socialize well with who you like maybe can you

258
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,040
give your family member a quick call even if you even if you have absolutely nothing new to say under

259
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,840
the sun guess what neither did they they have nothing new under the sun to talk about either

260
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,320
it's just a five minute phone call just because you don't have news refland doesn't mean they don't

261
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,360
do you feel secure in what you're doing that could be related to your job that could be related to

262
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:31,760
memeing around try and be kind to yourself okay because that is how we achieve uh safety needs

263
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,200
okay security is related to socialization as well okay so don't be don't be too worried don't be too

264
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,880
worried okay now there's one thing being secure in your social relationships and then if we have

265
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:52,000
done that we get to unlock belonging and needs belongingness and love and needs okay intimate

266
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,480
relationships friendships community okay this is where we're getting really this is where we're

267
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:04,240
starting to be like we need this okay so i hope you feel as accepted as you can be here okay

268
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:10,880
okay i am dumb i'm silly i don't understand what's going on in the world you guys have accepted me

269
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,160
without a shadow of a doubt i could have easily been rejected you guys have accepted me i hope

270
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:27,440
i extend the exact same environment back towards you okay um i don't expect you to be perfect

271
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,680
just as you do not expect me to be perfect okay this is the kind of

272
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,400
socialization that enables both the previous tier so the previous safety needs of security

273
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:50,240
as well as the intimacy of being accepted as a person you don't have to hide that

274
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,920
you're on the spectrum you don't have to mask you don't have to do anything you can put the most

275
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:01,440
cringeyest message in the world out there and i will giggle and be like hee hee whatever you're on

276
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:10,000
about that can you copy no you can't copy off someone okay so if you feel secure you have

277
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,800
belongingness in a community you you feel loved you feel all this good stuff okay then you can

278
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,960
move on to the next tier which is esteem needs prestige and feeling of accomplishment okay

279
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:30,880
so this is this one is uh a bit more difficult to achieve because not everyone can do it hell even

280
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,440
i'm not really getting there but we're working on it we're getting there do you feel like you are

281
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,520
getting life xp at the moment that is what if you are not that's what's preventing you from being

282
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:50,960
unable to ink that's it that's the answer um so do you feel like you're getting life xp xp

283
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:57,440
how would we get you some even if it's super small amount of xp you could learn a new skill

284
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:04,480

clam slam how do i sign up to be a participant yeah do i ask after class no that did not happen

382
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:39,600
unreal untrue also me who's releasing a freaking foot of teacher audio today after the stream this

383
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:50,320
is so messed up and oh this topic i'm very passionate about okay how peter jackson made the clutch of

384
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:58,560
the century and no one knows about it but now you are being knowing about it you are being

385
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:05,600
knowledge okay you're being knowledge so this is the hobbit in particular this is the hobbit

386
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:14,160
so big totoro uh toro was originally going to be the director but warner brothers refused to

387
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:20,880
give a finalized budget causing insane planning issues okay so this was originally going to be

388
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:27,280
the director but instead is peter jackson thank goodness but in his defense how on earth can you

389
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:34,560
plan for a movie at the time it was going to be two movies um if you don't even know what you can

390
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:42,960
afford so peter jackson stepped in what a legend okay from the stress alone of creating the hobbit

391
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,520
i think it was like 299 days to shoot it that doesn't include pre-production and anything

392
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:54,000
afterwards from stress alone he developed a stomach ulcer and then when he got healthy again

393
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:01,360
he jumped straight back into why is this man not getting acknowledgement for having insanely hard

394
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:08,000
working he is okay you thought that was gay but honestly i can see what you mean okay

395
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:15,760
um he was diagnosed with a perforated ulcer um he lost a serious amount of weight like an unhealthy

396
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,720
amount of weight if you have rapid weight loss that's actually not good for your body it shocks your

397
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:27,280
homeostasis abilities okay so originally the hobbit was actually going to be two films but quickly

398
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:34,000
into production um peter jackson and fran walsh realized that they were going to have to far out

399
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:44,000
an entire third movie overnight they had lost so much sleep so much sleep over this it's insanity

400
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:53,760
okay and it was the worst budget i will never forgive warner brothers i like such greedy bastards

401
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,920
they had seen how much lord of the rings earned and they went right do the hobbit but here's a

402
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,680
fraction of the fucking budget as if they didn't have the returns of lord of the rings sitting

403
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:12,080
in their wee book um uh literally i was typing this last night and i started vibrating in my

404
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:18,080
chair and like i was getting really aggressive with the keyboard and stuff i was raging okay so

405
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:25,600
peter jackson spent years on the pre-production of lord of the rings okay for the hobbit he had four

406
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:37,280
months four months pre-production for a trilogy is insane no wonder that poor man developed a

407
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:43,360
freaking stomach also okay stress in the workplace is real it's it's absolutely horrific what he went

408
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:50,880
through okay and i just want to say tariel might not be for you in the movie but she's for me and

409
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:57,200
then i'm spanking you okay i will not take tariel slander don't upset me okay not all characters

410
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,880
have to be lore friendly but i genuinely like her and i think the forbidden love thing is really cute

411
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:09,280
okay and anyway let's make out before i start crying at the hobbit okay and then i said i would

412
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,360
like to watch the hobbit on boxing day with you if that's okay and then on christmas we're gonna

413
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,800
watch lord of the rings but because this was about the hobbit i didn't really mention lord of the

414
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:25,360
rings that much but yeah okay let me let me get back into the correct side my lecturing side okay

415
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:32,240
so you've so you have now learned that peter jackson is a legend thank you i just need the world

497
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:16,720

500
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:33,200
be followed to that i always have on low latency but uh i guess youtube doesn't like me today

501
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:38,560
this stream was actually really good you like it did your brain get new wrinkles my brain has

502
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:45,520
three more wrinkles i messed up the day that's okay i'm in the future so technically it's not that

503
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:52,160
bad we got skilled gonna frame my strong to some degree on the wall i feel somewhat more knowledgeable

504
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:58,640
stroney if you look up the medical journal topic of pregnancy it says the window of ovulation

505
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:05,520
why are you saying it's too so i'm saying it's too because the reason why it's so extended is

506
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:11,280
will you accept pictures of our notes and quiz in marshmallow yeah wait did you actually do it

507
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:20,560
the reason why i say is two days is because the actual amount of time the egg can be fertilized

508
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:26,960
is is such a tiny tiny window so you know when couples are like oh we've been trying to get

509
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:33,520
pregnant for ages it's because you literally need to plop plop plop plop plop every single day if

510
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:41,280
you're serious about wanting a wane okay like if you're actually wanting a baby then you need to

511
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:47,520
plop every single day like days straight um but you know if by the third month you've plopped

512
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:53,920
every single day and no child has been born um all right sorry no um egg has taken you know

513
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:59,040
probably one partner's got infertility it's really not a big deal i don't know people make a really

514
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:06,960
big deal about that but oh someone said the bit about tomatoes and the prostate was good stuff

515
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,680
you learned something new yes it's because of the antioxidants um it really helps like do something

516
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:16,640
to your balls and stuff no your prostate which is i don't know i'm sure okay can i test out with you

517
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:21,600
not yet gen two is not in the oven yet okay i'll tell you when gen two is in the oven

518
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:28,240
you seem to have a lot of research on getting pregnant i find it really fascinating um

519
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:37,040
i like i looked into IVF and all of that no for me i'm not birthing a child anytime soon i can

520
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:45,040
assure you that much these nips stay pink in this corner um but it's um infertility is a very

521
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:51,840
so i need to choose my words carefully because i don't want to offend anyone

522
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:59,360
um some people see that not having children is the be all end all of their life and it can

523
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:07,520
completely decimate any uh semblance of confidence of self-esteem of um ego now it's

524
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:12,480
actually good to have ego believe it or not and it is really fascinating stuff the psychology

525
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:18,160
that plays in being told that you're infertile or you can't spawn your own offspring uh some

526
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:28,960
people that me if i was told that i cannot bear children reeflings that ASMR boost is happening

527
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:40,720
i don't give a fuck no risk are you joking like i don't give a fuck um micro plastics have messed

528
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:46,880
up or reproductive i would not be surprised if that is why there's a lot of people facing um

529
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:53,040
a lot of reproductive things but that's a conspiracy theory for another day because just

530
01:04:53,040 --> 01:05:00,960
remember if you ever think the government wouldn't do that they already knew about micro plastics

531
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:10,160
years ago they hid it from the people and this is the twelfth because i have found the research on it

532
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,720
uh

533
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:22,000

01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:07,040
are not taking a cut from bandsley um that was an oversight by me um because originally i said it

568
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:16,640
was going to be free access but i we violor do not dictate what if the girl streams on fansley or

569
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:21,760
not so they keep a hundred percent of the earnings so whatever price range is what they put on but

570
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:26,800
they earn a hundred percent we do not take any of a cut so i don't know what they're going to charge

571
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:31,440
i don't know what they're going to do it's on an individual basis i apologize but it's just how it's

572
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:37,440
going to be um it was a massive oversight for me to say that it was going to be free to view

573
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:44,560
because i don't like that's their stuff that's what they do the contract doesn't stipulate for the

574
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:50,400
girls to stream on uh bandsley or any kind of website like that so they get a hundred percent

575
01:09:50,400 --> 01:10:00,400
of their earnings um as always pretty much um so i do apologize um for my previous misinformation

576
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:05,840
i spoke before i actually thought about the situation but the girls are getting access on

577
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:10,560
august 1st i don't know what they're doing but as long as they have fun that's the main thing um

578
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:19,280
yes the girls have also come out with gamer subs um we are all getting sent pure packages so i don't

579
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:25,840
know if they're going to be a few handcam streams but i plan on doing a handcam stream um and gamer

580
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:31,120
subs were actually very kind and said that i'm allowed to say out loud that if um there's a

581
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:38,240
certain amount of sales number reached then vealer can potentially get a cup or a waifu

582
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:47,200
