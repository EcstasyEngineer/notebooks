319920	330160	participation okay that was beautiful thank you for doing our national anthem right let's get into
330160	337760	the education let me let me take a sipping tin of my tea topic one ovulation now a little reefling
337760	343760	i'm gonna need you to point a little around for me so the first topic's ovulation and then we've
343760	349680	got a little yeah that's how you know i'm a cool teacher okay that's how you know i'm a cool teacher
349680	357920	because i've got little emojis and stuff in the in the the presentation okay so there are no silly
357920	365920	answers reeflings just uneducated ones okay we are in the digital age of information so let us learn
365920	373440	together all right i have the very first poll for you now don't be embarrassed if you get anything
373440	381680	wrong that's not how any of this works it's not how any of it works okay let's do a poll you're
381680	392960	just to guess okay start a poll now the question is how many days in a month is a woman fertile
392960	400000	so how many how many days in a month can she get pregnant okay again there's no wrong questions
400000	407760	just there's no wrong answers um just uneducated ones and it's not your fault if you're uneducated
407760	413200	in anything the school system is not set up for the most successful if you're any sort of way
413200	420720	so please feel free to use the chat how often sorry how often how many days in a month do you
420720	427680	think a woman is fertile please again there is no wrong answers just uneducated ones okay
427680	434480	just uneducated one do not be embarrassed if you get anything wrong who said oh we've got a question
434480	443920	thank you for raising your hand are the three holes real um yes it is uh there's the p-hole the urea
444720	452480	there is the um vaginal entrance hole and then there is the anus for release of stool yes that's
452480	458640	a good question thank you thank you okay we're just getting some some of the results back some of
458640	465360	the results back okay we're going to end the poll results thank you everyone for participating in
465360	475600	that poll i am about to blow your mind little reeflings because c is actually not correct no a
475600	483760	woman is not fertile uh as soon as as soon as a woman experiences um periods no she's not
483760	492880	fertile at all moments but the next uh voted result b is seven days in a month she is fertile no
493680	505040	reeflings no a woman technically at a maximum per month at 48 days has a chance to get pregnant
506080	514640	now where do we even start with the reproductive system of a woman it is insanity no no please
514640	522400	don't worry please do not worry at all i will be taking any brian not now i'm teaching i will
522400	528000	respond to anything at the end of the uh the lecture thank you please do not blurt out in the middle
528000	532240	of class about your uh deadlift bench press thank you thank you reeflings keep it to yourself
532240	541120	also and reply after soon so technically during the monthly cycle of a woman okay there you know
541680	547120	when when a woman goes oh i'm ovulating you know how she can tell a certain type of slain
547120	553920	evacuates okay that's how a woman can tell she's ovulating she can only get pregnant
553920	561120	now i've been i've been very generous to say two days because on a technicality yes but the actual
561120	568400	egg that is ready to be fertilized before it falls too far from the fallopian tube down into the
568960	576320	the womb area 20 you've pretty much got 24 hours so you know when people say it's really hard to
576320	582160	conceive and they've been at it for ages because they're looking for the tiniest slither of a window
582160	588320	okay and and there's a bit of a misconception that the first time you ever have coyotes that
588320	594080	you cannot get pregnant this is a misconception please do not be embarrassed if you thought
594080	599280	these things the reason i am bringing it up is because that's what people think and i want to
599280	604720	discuss it and um you know give you so you can get pregnant the very first time uh you quote you
604720	613280	have quite us um but um the reason why i'm giving you a two-day time frame to impregnate your uh
613280	622640	consenting adult is because sperm can stay alive in the womb for over five days so in theory
623600	631360	you could do the dance with someone okay and they are they're not in their fertile period
631360	637120	so they cannot get pregnant but then the egg moves into position causing them the ability
637120	644640	to get fertile from your few-day old sperm conception is an absolute miracle even happens
644640	652960	in the first place it is a fantastically uh unique thing um so again so this is the tight
652960	658880	clam syndrome one point to here and then this is where the cervix begins and the eggs come from
658880	666080	this ovary and it gets grabbed and it goes down the fallopian tube and into the cervix and if
667200	672240	if you're lucky so this is you many years ago however old you are this is you right now because
672240	677920	you were the first one to reach the egg so the first person to reach the egg wins everyone else
677920	687520	dies perishes and fire and no um and then there you go so this is where the tight clam entrance
687520	696640	is and then there's a little um length chamber now in hand you don't actually access the inner
696640	702000	cervix this would be incredibly painful you do not access this area but the sperm you
702480	709360	access the area and they swim up and then they touch the egg and then it's you it's fantastic
709360	716160	so yeah uh you've got 24 you're 24 hours to impregnate a woman monthly that is why when
716160	722400	people say they have a one-night stand and then a baby is the result of that oh my god you're so
722400	732640	unlucky that's really terrible but it was your choice not to wrap it so consequences of your
732640	742880	actions you know how it is okay next topic dun dun dun dun dun dun dun seeds glorious seeds
744160	748720	right i'm gonna drink my tea before it gets cold we're doing seeds take a look at the photo these
748720	754240	are my real seed collections as you can see you have a lot of samples drying before i put them away
754240	762080	in jars um oh we have a question thank you for raising your hand refilling is that a drawing
762080	768480	of your specific one no mine is a lot different mine is tilted it is a lot skinny milinky skinnier
768480	775040	and it really hurts so okay let me finish my tea you're not a teacher if you don't have a cup of
775040	781760	tea so i mean myself i'm okay okay you're not a real teacher if you don't like slurp the absolute
781760	784640	shit out of your tea are you ready for the slurpage are you ready
789440	793760	yeah literally why is it teacher slurps so loudly like yeah damn i thought i slurped loudly but
793760	801760	teachers are on some other level you can as long as you raise your hand uh you're feel feel free to
801760	808720	interrupt and ask a question as long as you raise your hand okay tilted yes uh just like the fortnight
808720	814080	tilted towers apparently my cervix is tilted so uh i'm extra good for doggie style let's go
816640	821680	hmm how is it tilted i just spawned in like that it's like why is your left one bigger than your
821680	826000	right one look i don't come at you and say stuff about your ball sack please do not come for my
826000	833440	tilted cervix i'd appreciate that this is ridiculous honestly
836080	842480	you're making me want a cup of tea again straight oh you got oh reefling got me an apple delicious
842480	846720	thank you i will have that apple at break you're such a teacher's pet there you go good reefling
847040	856160	okay our first uh our next question again remember do not be embarrassed
857520	862000	uh oh shit i can only have four options thank you nissa did alpha bravo charlie
862000	868000	uh the question i would like to ask you and again don't be afraid to be wrong don't there's nothing
868000	872960	wrong with being wrong you'll be shocked at how many things i'm wrong with and say it with full confidence
873600	883120	disperse my question for you is how many ways can seeds disperse this is our next topic seed
883120	887840	now it is unrelated to the previous topic but ovulation and impregnation uh i mean actual
887840	893440	seeds that come from plants and stuff now please don't be afraid to tell me how many types of
893440	901200	seed dispersal do you think there are well oh you need oh you've got a reason can we see your
901680	908960	serve it no okay next good will you the fact that you're is a part of the test will note it down
908960	919760	regardless that's hilarious i'll just give you more than the apple okay let's see what we say
919760	927040	we're saying there are four types is what the majority is saying oh we should have played
927040	932400	fucking cahoots you know that the cahoots have ip i will fucking make another stream like this
932400	945760	of cahoots doesn't have ip showing um yeah okay end poludes so the reeflings collectively decided
945760	953440	there's four types of seed dispersal that's curious okay can anyone please raise your hands
953440	961200	but can anyone tell me any type of seed dispersal because there are five types of speed seed
961200	968960	dispersal now if i've done this correctly i should actually have a certain there we go five types
968960	978400	can anyone in the class name any type of seed dispersal um or any type of example of a seed
978560	984080	dispersal please go on wow i missed a poll see that's what happens if you don't stay awake during
984080	988880	my class young man you need to wake up it's first thing in the morning you're being forced to be
988880	998800	educated um oh someone said explosion well done explosion is ballistics well done reefling
1000000	1006080	someone said spores now spores is related to mushroom very good answer not quite correct
1006080	1013280	but mushrooms aren't seeding seeding type of um thing so very good uh call out though don't worry
1013280	1020640	wind wind dispersal fantastic we have ballistic and wind someone says air i guess wind air
1020640	1025680	absolutely same someone says animal fantastic please remember to raise your hand if you are
1025680	1033360	shouting out it's hard to hear you all at once please do raise your hand fantastic now i'm looking
1033360	1041520	for two more we have animals ballistic and wind i'm looking for two more answers i'm trying to hear
1041520	1056160	it oh i'm looking i'm looking uh put dispersal that goes under animal very good very good
1056960	1062480	we have water dispersal fantastic that's four out of five there's one more type of dispersal
1062480	1069600	we have yet to unlock we have animal water ballistic wind don't worry pollination from insects
1069600	1075200	and animals now you're going you're going steps ahead you're going steps ahead so pollination is
1075200	1083280	how the seed is created the ovum and stem from the flowers come together oh we have falling fruits
1083280	1089920	well done we have discovered all five kinds of seed dispersal fantastic reeflings the delay is
1089920	1096080	20 seconds is it are you being for real right now why the fuck is it the least 30 seconds hold on
1097360	1104080	pause the role play is the dis is it 20 why is it 20 seconds are you serious setting
1106880	1111120	hold on hold on can i change this live or is it not gonna let me do it live
1112160	1113840	dinner karmia
1114160	1121920	why is it not ultra oh my god i can't change it because we're in the middle of a freaking stream
1121920	1128000	are you serious i can't change it midstream you're right we are on a 22nd delay why are we on a
1128000	1135680	22nd delay it's never been a 22nd delay before oh for goodness sake okay well anyway fantastic work
1135680	1146080	yes that is the five kinds of seed dispersal so gravity can be a type of a i think it's a sycamore
1146080	1150880	plant is that twirly one that comes down i'm so sorry i apologize i i don't know why it's not
1150880	1165440	on reactive wind example is a dandelion okay okay ballistic is an okra okra i probably
1165440	1173040	saying it horrifically wrong but basically it shoots out and it goes like okay and then water
1173920	1178560	is coconut did you know coconuts float and they were perfect for floating in the ocean
1179280	1183120	and coconuts are very unique thing i could probably go into a big massive rant about the
1183120	1187120	uniqueness of seeds and plants that's for another day and then an example of animals
1187120	1194560	dispersing seeds is an apple you eat the apple you eat the seed and then it's fantastic everyone's
1194560	1200080	having a good time thank you thank you and then this is my actual seed collection um i pick up seeds
1200080	1206160	on a wild walk i just go on a walk i grab seeds i have i'm gonna confess here um i have gone into
1206160	1210000	people's gardens just to grab seeds off of their plants and then run off their property again
1211280	1215600	but like these ones for example are drying out you must have a dry seed sample before you put
1215600	1222800	them away in these test tube thing uh little tube things or um you risk actually getting mold and
1222800	1228560	stuff like you can see this these tiny little black specks those are the seeds that's how tiny
1228560	1235440	they are in that sample but you can see the stain that the fruit um like the innards of the dispersal
1235440	1240560	method was i was actually uh i really enjoy seed collection uh unfortunately it's winter so there's
1240560	1247520	like nothing to collect right now um but that's safe this this seed band it look i don't only
1247520	1252640	steal seeds from flowers okay i steal your seed as well well i'm at it relax i'm doing
1252640	1263680	i'm molly tasking right back to school boom next topic region locked capitalism also known as
1264240	1271680	feudalism now let's just take a yes have you again i'm a cool lecturer so here's the king of the land
1271680	1278080	it goes it's free real estate and then it's michael from vsauce and then it goes or is it
1278080	1287200	vsauce theme plays boom boom now feudalism occurred within the ninth ninth century ninth yes
1287200	1296320	ninth century to the 15th century fantastic stuff it lasted a very long time so first
1296320	1303840	reef links i would like you to imagine not having full access to the world map okay the reason
1303840	1311440	for this is because the globe was the globe was unlockable however um the humanity did not put
1311440	1317600	enough perk points into transportation yet to unlock globalism so we weren't at that stage we
1317600	1326400	were region locked capitalism which is called feudalism okay um so feudalism is the dominant
1326400	1337520	social system in medieval europe okay where the disgusting nasty disease ridden peasants us were
1337520	1346480	forced into labor on farms right but in the exchange of this labor uh oh let me just read
1346480	1353920	how the the how it's phrased online we're obligated we're obliged to live on the lord's land and give
1353920	1363760	him homage labor and share of the produce notionally in exchange for military protection okay because
1363760	1368400	people used to pillage and stuff back in them times right and nay one once shanked everyone was
1368400	1373440	minding their own business nay one once shanks but you don't like the stories and nights nights
1373440	1380000	are real okay nights are actually a thing that happened okay so if we look at our beloved pyramid
1380640	1387280	um of region locked capitalism um we are the peasants and the serfs we are down here this is
1387280	1396880	us down here we would be telling the soil in the fields producing all of the food um what did i walk
1396960	1406880	into i'm becoming a teacher um so we made all the food in exchange that we could have basically
1406880	1415120	have board and protection from being shanked okay okay um so there's craftsmen there was farmers
1415120	1420640	and merchants now those were above us that's what we were trying to obtain to be it was not possible
1420640	1426160	to spawn it it was so hard if you were a peasant and to spawn in and then to become a knight or a
1426160	1436240	battle but with any form of shitty capitalism there's always a high table and the high table
1436240	1444080	tier begins at the nobles and the monarchs and then the pope and the church they are all high tier
1444080	1453040	table and above do not be mistaken okay you ate your homework what do you mean you ate your homework
1453040	1462160	i've not even given you your homework yet shish but yeah um this is a high table and above so nobles
1462160	1471040	monarchs pope and church untouchable to us filthy disgusting leprosy infected no peasants okay okay
1471040	1477360	the pope above the monarch what do you mean the church is above the state hmm oh we have uh
1477360	1481760	thank you for putting your hand excuse me is first by it's first dream by the way is learning
1481760	1488800	this okay for the channel or is this what monetization oh what oh no you can learn what you want
1490080	1493120	i ain't here for the money i'm here for the education you're getting educated against your
1493360	1501840	pop up okay so that is how it used to be you used to get shanked back in the day you'd be
1501840	1507840	randomly getting stabbed minding your own business so in exchange for safety on someone's land
1508800	1513200	you would do all the work reap hardly any benefit so this is a really shitty disgusting
1513200	1519120	version of capitalism unfortunately capitalism kind of popped off today but i do want to note
1520000	1529600	why did feudalism fail does any refling have any idea or inclination why feudalism failed
1529600	1537120	and became old and became outdated that out no longer reflected the society that the world
1537680	1543520	was in hmm can any remember there's no wrong answers it's okay if you actually don't know
1543520	1551120	you are more than welcome to suggest a reason why you think feudalism uh was timed out in the 15th
1551120	1560240	century um hmm i spelled capitalism wrong damn straight i did there must be always
1562640	1570080	oh thank you we've got corruption and oh okay okay nobility industrial revolution very good
1570080	1578160	french people i like it i like it because of fast travel we're getting there trade yet rise of
1578160	1583200	trade the black plague that did really mess up europe that's a different i did not put that in this
1583200	1590320	lecture because of the rise of the merchant class now what has been identified was the
1590320	1600400	decline of knights and castles because knights were such a prolific enemy to your life they were
1600400	1606880	such a danger to your life and kind of having knights to order around to execute willy nilly
1606880	1615200	people left and right but because of the falling of castles of kingdoms of locations the decline
1616000	1624080	people started to say hold on a minute i can go do all of this myself and reap a heck of a lot more
1624080	1632080	than what you're willing to give me so uh it did fail so i have hope all i'm saying is that between
1632080	1635920	the ninth and the fifth oh did i say the eighth it's the ninth century sorry between the ninth and
1635920	1642080	the 15th century six hundred years give or take a new form i'm feeling sick can i go to the nurse

1648560	1655120	okay next stage boom topic four since we were looking at a pyramid earlier okay
1655920	1663920	since we're looking at a pyramid we're gonna move on to big boy maslow's hierarchy of needs let's
1666080	1670080	okay as you can see i'm hiding up my emote that's behind me right now but we're looking at
1670080	1678400	maslow's hierarchy of needs now have you ever felt kaka before okay have you ever felt like you do
1678400	1685760	not belong are the brain worms just winning as these are the questions i have for you stop
1687200	1691360	don't take your medicine just yet okay don't take your medicine just yet
1691360	1699040	let's get to the bottom huh or the pyramid okay so you can reach the top
1699680	1706560	uh uh uh so let us come up with a problem together and find the solution let's find the solution
1706560	1712640	together to a problem a hypothetical problem so we're gonna take a little little dive into
1712640	1722640	maslow's hierarchy of needs boom all right refling take it away problem strongy i can't
1722640	1731520	ink anymore something's wrong and my lust is gone well we have found our problem worry not

1745600	1752160	read at the end okay so we have maslow's hierarchy of needs here okay we have psychological uh
1752160	1760320	psychophysiological needs hey we got there in the end i'll take that we have safety needs
1760320	1766400	belonging self-esteem and then self-actualization okay so if you cannot ink we're gonna take this
1766400	1774400	problem physiological needs so this is your physical stuff you need your to achieve homeostasis
1774400	1780320	homeostasis is when your body is maintaining yourself fine it feels good it's happy things
1780320	1787680	are good okay so what aren't we achieving together what needs to change dany to tuck you into bed

1801600	1805440	but oh thank you for putting your hand up but mummy maslow's hierarchy needs have been showed to be
1805440	1810720	overly simplistic and not no i don't want to hear it okay i don't want to hear i like maslow i really
1810720	1815680	like maslow okay do i need to feed you could i could bring you a toothbrush if you didn't brush your
1815680	1821600	teeth in bed i'm not gonna judge no no problem with me i just want your needs to be met because if
1821600	1829440	your needs are met in big old maslow a big abraham maslow said if you have met all your homeostasis
1829440	1838800	needs we get to move up a tier okay we get to move up to your safety needs security safety okay so
1838800	1845360	security can come in a form of different ways okay so i have are you able to socialize well with who
1845360	1852480	you like hold on i'm gonna have to move my big old head where's my moose oh sorry my cursors
1852480	1857760	having a hold on let me move myself i'm in the way i'll sit on the i'll just camp down here okay
1857760	1864240	sorry i'm i'm camping in chat um are you able to socialize well with who you like maybe can you
1864240	1869040	give your family member a quick call even if you even if you have absolutely nothing new to say under
1869040	1873840	the sun guess what neither did they they have nothing new under the sun to talk about either
1873840	1878320	it's just a five minute phone call just because you don't have news refland doesn't mean they don't
1878320	1883360	do you feel secure in what you're doing that could be related to your job that could be related to
1883360	1891760	memeing around try and be kind to yourself okay because that is how we achieve uh safety needs
1891760	1897200	okay security is related to socialization as well okay so don't be don't be too worried don't be too
1897200	1904880	worried okay now there's one thing being secure in your social relationships and then if we have
1904880	1912000	done that we get to unlock belonging and needs belongingness and love and needs okay intimate
1912000	1916480	relationships friendships community okay this is where we're getting really this is where we're
1916480	1924240	starting to be like we need this okay so i hope you feel as accepted as you can be here okay
1924240	1930880	okay i am dumb i'm silly i don't understand what's going on in the world you guys have accepted me
1930880	1936160	without a shadow of a doubt i could have easily been rejected you guys have accepted me i hope
1936160	1947440	i extend the exact same environment back towards you okay um i don't expect you to be perfect
1947440	1953680	just as you do not expect me to be perfect okay this is the kind of
1955600	1962400	socialization that enables both the previous tier so the previous safety needs of security
1962400	1970240	as well as the intimacy of being accepted as a person you don't have to hide that
1970240	1975920	you're on the spectrum you don't have to mask you don't have to do anything you can put the most
1975920	1981440	cringeyest message in the world out there and i will giggle and be like hee hee whatever you're on
1981440	1990000	about that can you copy no you can't copy off someone okay so if you feel secure you have
1990000	1996800	belongingness in a community you you feel loved you feel all this good stuff okay then you can
1996800	2002960	move on to the next tier which is esteem needs prestige and feeling of accomplishment okay
2003120	2010880	so this is this one is uh a bit more difficult to achieve because not everyone can do it hell even
2010880	2017440	i'm not really getting there but we're working on it we're getting there do you feel like you are
2017440	2023520	getting life xp at the moment that is what if you are not that's what's preventing you from being
2023520	2030960	unable to ink that's it that's the answer um so do you feel like you're getting life xp xp
2030960	2037440	how would we get you some even if it's super small amount of xp you could learn a new skill
2037440	2044480	you could investigate a topic that you're interested in and gain new knowledge um working with others
2044480	2050640	can thrust you into so much easy xp literally the minecraft xp on the floor if you go work in a
2050640	2058480	coffee shop just picking up all that minecraft xp on the floor okay um working with others or
2058480	2063360	putting yourself in a situation where you can enable others too to achieve what they need to do
2063360	2068240	okay um this sounds really silly but you can how your mum does all the dishes
2069520	2076240	unload the dishwasher once okay she'll be she'll be shocked and in a good way not in a bad way
2076240	2081360	but just you have enabled your mum one less thing she has to think about in the household okay
2081360	2089200	these are just the other thing okay and then um you can also enable you can be the secret hero
2089200	2093280	that doesn't get acknowledged in the credits of the movie but deep down you know it was your
2093280	2099680	refling that these things can give you life xp that is what gives you self-esteem well it says
2099680	2105920	esteem needs they don't necessarily mean self-esteem but esteem is quite a big social you need to be
2105920	2110640	confident in yourself to you know be able to put yourself out there get confident do things okay
2112320	2116960	so oh i've got a question but if the problem is the fact that you have nothing more to get from
2116960	2123600	one of your passions you just went so deep there's nothing left um so you have created then in that
2123600	2131760	scenario um pathways or positivity you have ease of pathways in your head when it comes to nostalgia
2131760	2137680	in that particular topic just means you have to find something new are you telling me little
2137680	2145920	reefland in this whole wide world you can um think of one thing to get educated in okay now if you
2145920	2156400	have a completed esteem needs self-actualization you can beat your shmeat right now if you're at
2156400	2165440	this stage of self-actualization ink for me after this stream look at the comic that's on my alt account
2166400	2174240	look at you taking over you can do whatever you want whatever you say i'll do and i'll take it

2709920	2716160	so good at this presentation but it's true so please do consider upping your tomatoes okay
2717760	2725600	okay any tomato lovers i saw you this weekend running an event called strone's saturday night
2725680	2732960	clam slam how do i sign up to be a participant yeah do i ask after class no that did not happen
2732960	2739600	unreal untrue also me who's releasing a freaking foot of teacher audio today after the stream this
2739600	2750320	is so messed up and oh this topic i'm very passionate about okay how peter jackson made the clutch of
2750320	2758560	the century and no one knows about it but now you are being knowing about it you are being
2758560	2765600	knowledge okay you're being knowledge so this is the hobbit in particular this is the hobbit
2766320	2774160	so big totoro uh toro was originally going to be the director but warner brothers refused to
2774160	2780880	give a finalized budget causing insane planning issues okay so this was originally going to be
2780880	2787280	the director but instead is peter jackson thank goodness but in his defense how on earth can you
2787280	2794560	plan for a movie at the time it was going to be two movies um if you don't even know what you can
2794560	2802960	afford so peter jackson stepped in what a legend okay from the stress alone of creating the hobbit
2802960	2807520	i think it was like 299 days to shoot it that doesn't include pre-production and anything
2807520	2814000	afterwards from stress alone he developed a stomach ulcer and then when he got healthy again
2814000	2821360	he jumped straight back into why is this man not getting acknowledgement for having insanely hard
2821360	2828000	working he is okay you thought that was gay but honestly i can see what you mean okay
2828960	2835760	um he was diagnosed with a perforated ulcer um he lost a serious amount of weight like an unhealthy
2835760	2840720	amount of weight if you have rapid weight loss that's actually not good for your body it shocks your
2841360	2847280	homeostasis abilities okay so originally the hobbit was actually going to be two films but quickly
2847280	2854000	into production um peter jackson and fran walsh realized that they were going to have to far out
2854000	2864000	an entire third movie overnight they had lost so much sleep so much sleep over this it's insanity
2864000	2873760	okay and it was the worst budget i will never forgive warner brothers i like such greedy bastards
2873760	2879920	they had seen how much lord of the rings earned and they went right do the hobbit but here's a
2879920	2885680	fraction of the fucking budget as if they didn't have the returns of lord of the rings sitting
2886480	2892080	in their wee book um uh literally i was typing this last night and i started vibrating in my
2892080	2898080	chair and like i was getting really aggressive with the keyboard and stuff i was raging okay so
2898080	2905600	peter jackson spent years on the pre-production of lord of the rings okay for the hobbit he had four
2905600	2917280	months four months pre-production for a trilogy is insane no wonder that poor man developed a
2917280	2923360	freaking stomach also okay stress in the workplace is real it's it's absolutely horrific what he went
2923360	2930880	through okay and i just want to say tariel might not be for you in the movie but she's for me and
2930880	2937200	then i'm spanking you okay i will not take tariel slander don't upset me okay not all characters
2937200	2942880	have to be lore friendly but i genuinely like her and i think the forbidden love thing is really cute
2942880	2949280	okay and anyway let's make out before i start crying at the hobbit okay and then i said i would
2949280	2953360	like to watch the hobbit on boxing day with you if that's okay and then on christmas we're gonna
2953360	2956800	watch lord of the rings but because this was about the hobbit i didn't really mention lord of the

3705520	3712160	bad we got skilled gonna frame my strong to some degree on the wall i feel somewhat more knowledgeable
3713600	3718640	stroney if you look up the medical journal topic of pregnancy it says the window of ovulation
3719440	3725520	why are you saying it's too so i'm saying it's too because the reason why it's so extended is
3725520	3731280	will you accept pictures of our notes and quiz in marshmallow yeah wait did you actually do it
3732160	3740560	the reason why i say is two days is because the actual amount of time the egg can be fertilized
3740560	3746960	is is such a tiny tiny window so you know when couples are like oh we've been trying to get
3746960	3753520	pregnant for ages it's because you literally need to plop plop plop plop plop every single day if
3753520	3761280	you're serious about wanting a wane okay like if you're actually wanting a baby then you need to
3761280	3767520	plop every single day like days straight um but you know if by the third month you've plopped
3767520	3773920	every single day and no child has been born um all right sorry no um egg has taken you know
3773920	3779040	probably one partner's got infertility it's really not a big deal i don't know people make a really
3779040	3786960	big deal about that but oh someone said the bit about tomatoes and the prostate was good stuff
3786960	3791680	you learned something new yes it's because of the antioxidants um it really helps like do something
3791680	3796640	to your balls and stuff no your prostate which is i don't know i'm sure okay can i test out with you
3797280	3801600	not yet gen two is not in the oven yet okay i'll tell you when gen two is in the oven
3802400	3808240	you seem to have a lot of research on getting pregnant i find it really fascinating um
3809600	3817040	i like i looked into IVF and all of that no for me i'm not birthing a child anytime soon i can
3817040	3825040	assure you that much these nips stay pink in this corner um but it's um infertility is a very
3827120	3831840	so i need to choose my words carefully because i don't want to offend anyone
3831840	3839360	um some people see that not having children is the be all end all of their life and it can
3839360	3847520	completely decimate any uh semblance of confidence of self-esteem of um ego now it's
3847520	3852480	actually good to have ego believe it or not and it is really fascinating stuff the psychology
3852480	3858160	that plays in being told that you're infertile or you can't spawn your own offspring uh some
3858160	3868960	people that me if i was told that i cannot bear children reeflings that ASMR boost is happening
3868960	3880720	i don't give a fuck no risk are you joking like i don't give a fuck um micro plastics have messed
3880720	3886880	up or reproductive i would not be surprised if that is why there's a lot of people facing um
3887760	3893040	a lot of reproductive things but that's a conspiracy theory for another day because just
3893040	3900960	remember if you ever think the government wouldn't do that they already knew about micro plastics
3900960	3910160	years ago they hid it from the people and this is the twelfth because i have found the research on it

4129040	4138640	can ask away for bandsley okay so i come to a terrible realization um so the girl i violor
4138640	4147040	are not taking a cut from bandsley um that was an oversight by me um because originally i said it
4147040	4156640	was going to be free access but i we violor do not dictate what if the girl streams on fansley or
4156640	4161760	not so they keep a hundred percent of the earnings so whatever price range is what they put on but
4161760	4166800	they earn a hundred percent we do not take any of a cut so i don't know what they're going to charge
4166800	4171440	i don't know what they're going to do it's on an individual basis i apologize but it's just how it's
4171440	4177440	going to be um it was a massive oversight for me to say that it was going to be free to view
4177440	4184560	because i don't like that's their stuff that's what they do the contract doesn't stipulate for the
4184560	4190400	girls to stream on uh bandsley or any kind of website like that so they get a hundred percent
4190400	4200400	of their earnings um as always pretty much um so i do apologize um for my previous misinformation
4200400	4205840	i spoke before i actually thought about the situation but the girls are getting access on
4205840	4210560	august 1st i don't know what they're doing but as long as they have fun that's the main thing um
4211760	4219280	yes the girls have also come out with gamer subs um we are all getting sent pure packages so i don't
4219280	4225840	know if they're going to be a few handcam streams but i plan on doing a handcam stream um and gamer
4225920	4231120	subs were actually very kind and said that i'm allowed to say out loud that if um there's a
4231120	4238240	certain amount of sales number reached then vealer can potentially get a cup or a waifu
4238240	4247200	shaker baker maker producers um uh so yeah if you drink it in general or you ever wanted to try it
4247200	4252560	out please don't be afraid to use anyone's code at any point um hundred percent of the earnings
4252560	4260400	go to them again vealer does not take a cut um it is a hundred percent to them um and yeah uh that
4260400	4266560	was like a really big news we were sitting on that news for a while um i can finally talk about it
