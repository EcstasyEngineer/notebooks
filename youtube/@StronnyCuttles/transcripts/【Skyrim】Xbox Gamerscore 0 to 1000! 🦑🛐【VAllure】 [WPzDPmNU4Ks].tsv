0	9800	Testing, testing. Attention, please. Attention, attention. Hear you, hear you.
9800	17000	Skyrim belongs to the North. That's my hear you, hear you. Why are you saying I
17000	22840	hate you? I'm not even fricking spawning yet! Let me spawn in! You know, I learned
22840	28000	something new yesterday thanks to TikTok so I can't wait to talk about it.
28000	41920	Right, testing. This is Ambroker. See this fricking, you fricking freaks? Oh my God! Oh my
41920	49200	God! I'm YouTube, I got accepted from YouTube monetization like right now. No
49200	55520	way! I just got accepted for YouTube monetization right fricking now. No way!
55520	62560	Wait, but I need to do my stream then. Wait! Oh my God! I literally just opened up
62560	72360	YouTube studio. I've been accepted. No way! Wait, do I need to go offline and do my...
72360	79920	No, I'll do it tomorrow. Oh my God! We did it! What the frick? What the frick frack
79920	86920	tiddly-tack-tick-tack-patty-work? Oh my God! Wait, and hopefully this doesn't say anything.
86920	93120	Wow! Wow! I just fricking checked. Right, right. We're still going to do Skyrim
93120	97680	today because you know, Skyrim belongs to the Norths. But tomorrow I'll get to do my
97680	103360	monetization celebration stream! And my toe is like amazing for it so I'm excited.
103360	109680	Oh my God! That's amazing. Right, if you're fricking watching right now, don't
109680	114720	worry about how you call it. The memberships aren't activated because I
114720	120720	need to go in and tell it what to call the tiers and stuff. But I'm 100%
120720	127240	sure tier one is $1.99 USD. This is to prevent anyone gaining access via
127240	133320	gift to membership streams. And then I believe the membership price, like the
133360	147360	actual price, is $4.99 USD. Does that sound right? I need to ask you guys. I need to ask you guys what sounds right.
147360	155280	You guys call the shots. Yeah, if it's $4.99 USD and then Patreon's $5 USD then it's $9.99 total to
155280	160240	support your Oshii at Veiler. You're okay. That seems right. Okay, that sounds
160280	163480	okay. Everyone's going to give me the thumbs up.
163480	169480	Congrats on the monetization. Doesn't mean we won't support you in other ways anymore though.
169480	172480	Oh, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.
172480	179480	Why are you giving me money for getting more money?
179480	188840	What the fuck? It's an infinite money glitch. Oh my God. Also, there was an offline donation
188880	193840	by Shank. Shank says, thank you for the tip, by the way. He says, I'm over here squidding
193840	200920	my dick. I got ink on my dick right now. Which is so good. Thank you, Tim Shuttle. Congrats
200920	207120	on the monetization. Thank you. And Bajinga as well. Thank you again for the tip, for
207120	214720	the 20. That was a big tip. Thank you. Okay, to prevent gifts, you need to set the membership
214720	220640	quote above five bucks. Are you serious? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wasn't it not membership
220640	228480	can only be gifted? Stop giving me! Why are you giving me money for being able to make
228480	237480	Oh my God. No, I have to end my ASMR series now. I have four ASMR videos. I owe you. Oh,
237480	242480	and I'm doing an endurance stream today. It's over. Reluctantly saying thank you for the
242520	251020	tip. Wait, I could have sworn you can only gift the lowest tier membership on YouTube
251020	256320	or has that been updated since? I won't say who so they can announce it themselves, but
256320	262600	someone else has also gotten monetized. Oh my God, we're all done are monetized. No way.
262600	267960	Like, okay, so the only reason we didn't like monetize faster in quotation marks is because
267960	276520	you stop it. Don't give me money for getting money. Preordering my search. Thank you. Don't
276520	283320	stay down for the tip. That's crazy. That's freaking crazy. Gifts go to the most expensive
283320	289480	tier under five bucks. So I need to set it as 501. That looks terrible though. That looks
289480	296160	so greedy, but I can't have any outsiders in the membership streams because I need to
296160	303240	use a lot of euphemisms. Are you squid me right now? Shank. Oh, it's offline. I'm all
303240	309920	about stron of the bath. Thanks, Shank, for the tip. You guys will get the Blackwater
309920	318920	reference very shortly. Super training up. Virginia. Stop. Actually, one cent greed law.
318920	325240	Actually, it's two cent greed because I wanted it $4.99 as fat. Said it to sit. No, $6 is
325320	333320	too much. This is too much money to ask for, like, for membership stuff. Oh, right, that's
333320	339120	it. When I said we're making an agency together, we flinched. I wasn't kidding. Oh, I see.
339120	344040	And our snowberries are here. They just did an ASMR stream. We all have to keep our voices
344040	351200	down, okay? The snowberries are asleep. Fine, you've got it. Set it to 999. I would start
351280	362280	at $60 just to be sure. Post up. Hi, icy raiders. Hi, snowberries. I just unlocked monetization.
362280	367920	I didn't know until I freaking went on my channel. It just happened right now. I'm not
367920	373000	going to do my monetization celebration today. I'm going to do it tomorrow and then it gives
373000	377680	me less time to do endurance skyrim unless we come back to maybe switch up the thingy.
377760	384480	But that's okay. It's actually a perfect transition from icy stream. Hi, hi, little icicle.
386480	394640	But yes, we are all getting monetized very slowly, which is fantastic. Oh my gosh, you can get
394640	400800	support via email or chat. Don't worry, that chat support thing does absolutely nothing.
401760	408800	I assure you, it doesn't do a single thing, okay? I actually, I tell a lie, they did help me one
408800	413920	time, so I'll give it up. Amy, thank you, Amy, for your clap, clap, clap. Apparently, there's
413920	418800	one other person that has been processed. When we applied, it was like, yeah, it takes a month
418800	425360	for them to review your chat. A month! A month to review James Cameron's avatar, excuse me.
425360	433440	A month to freaking review Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, excuse me. Oh no, no, oh you guys
433440	442800	so much ASMR video. But I do have some good news about VTuber Collabs. I finally, I finally
445120	452960	sent away. So now I'm waiting on the girls. The ball is now in the girls court that I'm collabing
452960	464720	with. Yeah, yesterday, I was listening to a music creator called Yoast. He's a Dutch and he was in
464720	474560	Eurovision and he said, welcome to Europe. Life is till the end, Europe, Europe, Europe. Turns out he has
474560	483680	a song where it goes, suck my, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. So just imagine me playing the song and
483680	494080	repeat in the dark, taping up four ASMR collabs in one go. A month review time sounds realistic,
494080	500960	given the fact that your streams are all above 10 hours. Like I also thank you for the tip again,
501040	504720	but you're giving a lot of money. You need to be careful. Are you screaming me right now?
510320	517200	Thank you for the tip. Oh my God. Damn, I almost got that song out of my head. Yeah, so basically
517200	526000	just imagine me in a dark room. Just, I had this song on repeat. I'm like, yeah, okay. Right,
526000	532080	Wolf Mums, Pamper You to Sleep, right? Okay, what's next? Okay, Jealous VTubers drag you in an
532080	538240	alleyway for tangos. Okay, but what's next? What's next? Right, next script now. Like I was on it.
538240	545440	I was on it. Anonymous. It's the silent and on his back. He's giving money, but he's not saying
545440	550960	anything. He's not getting Brian to say anything. Thank you for the tip. But yeah, anyway, that's
551040	556160	how I work. I don't know how you work, but I work like a madman. Had to take a shower. So I've got
556160	562320	to listen at 1.5 speed for the next 15 minutes. I was not prepared for the super speed beat up.
564240	570400	So I was as strong as I forgot to live tweet or tweet. If you mean tweet, I have absolutely
570400	577120	horrific news. I am the worst VTuber to ever spawn. I never use my emotes. I spent like so much on
577120	582240	all these emotes. I never use them. I never tweet out when I'm live, because I start at the same
582240	588960	time every single day and I'm like, you want to be here, you're gonna be here. Somebody,
590160	594640	absolutely. Next script. YouTube to monetize you one day after you get approved. I mean,
594640	599840	depending on how the monetization celebration goes tomorrow, that's quite plausible. But hey,
599840	606320	at least a little bit YouTube history. Don't mind if I make the headlines for Veal Ur. So
606320	611040	you guys go and support my gen mates. That's right. There are five other lovely girls in the
611040	617920	description below for you to check out. If you cannot stand, Todd winning yet again with the
617920	624160	Death Grip, the Skyrim has over female VTubers. Okay. So if you've had enough of that,
624160	630080	Denny, you worry. I've got you sorted out. Sheepsters is going live in two minus two hours.
630080	635600	I believe Emma and Azura, my goodness Azura, and is coming for my Endurance Stream title.
637600	645360	For Goodness Gravy, she was up on a farm. No, it's not called Farmville. The farming star,
645360	649760	Jew Valley, for goodness sake. And then she beady popped out of 10 of her Endurance Stream. I'm
649760	655200	like, damn, they're coming from my title. I'm gonna show them how it's done. Okay, I'm gonna show
655200	660400	them how it's done. I woke up feeling sick and I was like, oh, maybe I would do an Endurance Stream.
660400	665840	But the moment I hit go live, it feels like I have been given a second burst of energy,
665840	670800	a second wind, if you will. It's like that cinematic moment in like the video game
671760	675280	thing. We're like, oh, Brian.
675280	681440	Congrats on monetization. Does the meet and greet VIP pass come with the highest membership tier
681440	690720	pre-order? Zarian. Dapper. Why would you give 100? That's so much. You never even said anything,
690720	699920	Dapper bucket. Oh my God. Thank you for the 100. Iron Reaper 100. Why are you? Why are you giving me
699920	707120	money for being able to earn more money? What's going on? What's going on? Have I missed something
707120	714000	in the VTuber etiquette book? Iron Reaper, thank you for the 100. Dapper, thank you for the 100.
714000	720640	Zarian, congrats on monetization. Meet and greet for anyone who goes over $20 on the donut.
721680	727200	That's terrible. You can't say that part out loud. Literally, everyone is giving your,
727200	733680	yeah, please make sure you are fully sorted before you give any money. Please understand,
733760	742240	I adore what I do. I have been welcomed with open arms into the VTuber community as someone who
742240	747760	could definitely have been described as an outsider. And instead of being shunned,
747760	754000	I was welcomed and taught the ropes, which I'm so thankful for. But please understand,
754000	762160	like, I can stream for free. I love what I do, okay? Anonymous with a 20 with no message again.
762160	768640	Brian, you look, you need to put Brian to work, guys, okay? You need to put Brian to work. Oh,
768640	777760	Anonymous gave me 20 because I said the 20 thing. That is terrible. But we've done it. We
777760	786000	officially have finished our first week at Bueller headquarters. Literally, everyone has done
786000	790800	fantastic streaming. I am very happy to see some of the girls taking a break.
791520	795840	Orvon Biscay. Brian. We don't like giving YouTube a cut.
798080	802880	Wait, oh, that's why you just stream elements. Okay, I understand. I read about that. Thank you,
802880	809200	Orvon Biscay. Brian! Don't knows will continue until morale improves. Congratulations. Wait,
809200	816240	why did I know that? Quote. Do you guys hear Brian at all when he talks? Yeah, you do. Surely you do.
816480	824800	Oh my god. Wait, you said I said your name yesterday correctly. Rilke? Rilke? Cadmus?
824800	828880	Thank you for the tip. Why did I know that quote? Yeah, we hear him. Okay, thank god.
831280	835920	God, it feels like so much longer. You've always been here. I think because, like,
835920	842640	my average streamed week is probably what a VTuber achieves in an entire month. So it feels like
842640	847680	I've been here for a very long time. I was like, nope, this is officially my first, like,
848400	854320	strong, you know, first second week of streaming. Ancient joke. The beatings will continue until
854320	865120	the more. Okay, that's okay. Okay, okay, okay. Guys, do you know a perfect way to party the
865120	870880	achievement? A really big storm of bad joke. What did you even say? Was that supposed to be a joke?
871520	876560	I don't get it. I don't get the joke if that was supposed to be a joke. So you're getting crickets.
881200	885600	Who's ready? Who's ready for bi-zura, bi-zura, bi-zura. Now, I know that's not in this game,
885600	889200	but bi-zura. Remember that time I accident... Wait, can you hear the game?
892480	895600	Can you hear any of that? You can't hear any of that.
896160	902160	Oh, oh, oh, wait, get monetization off the screen right now.
903760	906560	Oh, my freaking mouse won't hover over... Right, there we go.

1262900	1268340	okay so Skyrim is the current region that we're in there's different regions
1268340	1273380	such as Hammerfell for example oh Brian you'd rather go to the woods with a

1293900	1298260	are tall and fair-haired people strong and hardy Nord are famous for the
1298260	1304200	resistance to cold and their talent as warriors they can use a battle cry to

2317380	2324020	right I know I'm dressing up as the enemy okay but that's heavy armor uh we're gonna wait where the
2324020	2331540	frick is the key or he gets the key okay storm coke and drip in the same sentences oxymoronic
2332180	2336660	how do they're both bad but storm cooks are just worse the high king was leader of the good factions
2336740	2340660	the sky room and he surrendered to the empire because they were the less bad option I didn't
2340660	2345060	know that I thought it was like the thalmor embassy came in and they were like you can he
2345060	2349220	worship talus anymore and I was like eh you can't he come into my company and tell me what I can do
2349220	2355460	and can he do so eh I'll pick this guy storm cooks like you can't he just go and be doing that like
2355460	2362180	that's a region right where's the enemies oh oh yeah that's right look at that come oh my god it's
2362180	2372660	so bad on pc like when we analogue stick oh wow kill cam stealth goes from input I don't know
2372660	2378420	I'm normally like a two-handed player I always try to be an archer and I always end up two-handed
2378420	2385460	because there's a really good freaking um there's a really good um
2385780	2399380	enchantment which you can get from uh the yeah sorry torturer yeah yeah you're trying to tell me
2399380	2412420	that uh oh oh she getting it she annihilated him no I haven't seen him uh you can lock pick these for
2412500	2419380	like ah I guess we'll try it so there's eh you can literally smurf this if you leave and then
2419380	2431220	shuggle it hear that hear that if you do super gently see so we now know it's left side
2433300	2440500	oh I'm not getting pranked there you can literally smurf like all this stuff if you want it to be
2440500	2445300	made you can pick up this stuff but we are actually going to sell it because it's good
2445300	2450020	money I don't think I think there's a shield behind here if you wanted to do yeah if you want a shield
2450020	2455060	then uh there is one here but I don't really bother with shield that I do two-handed so we're
2455060	2460260	going to get a warhammer very shortly eh there should be coins down here and one of these if I'm
2460260	2467380	not mistaken I guess 300 no 300 coins seems a bit extreme maybe 30 coins in there and we are just
2467460	2477540	going to blast through it um try two-handing mage mage is my fave no two-handed warrior two-handed
2478180	2483620	lightweight warrior and you can muck around with a bow and an arrow like if you do the nightingale
2483620	2489540	quest you get light armor that's pretty sneaky but the thief-skilled armor especially for this
2489540	2497860	stamina and like item increase is so good um as for how we're going to tackle what we do first
2498420	2505460	um I'm going to purposefully do the companion's quest line and then load a previous save because
2505460	2511460	I don't like oh sorry sorry hold on I was out of stamina I was trying to reach up um that
2511860	2524580	I see it just posted a very watery tweet no way the the piss corp uh accusations
2524580	2529860	we ain't beating them today and we ain't beating them tomorrow and the nightingales yeah pure mage
2529860	2536820	is hard mode I there should be something up here if I remember correctly on the right side of these
2536820	2544420	rocks what was it oh it's just a weak coin purse I got 14 gold honestly per scaley boy he's he's
2544420	2551380	gone you he couldn't get out but the bars are broken now I love the jewel wheels nightingale
2551940	2562100	peeler no not peeler that's awful but that's hilarious at the same time um right there are
2562100	2571700	spiders so if any of you are arachnophobic wow um don't worry they are getting absolutely yeah I've
2571700	2577620	been poisoned I think they give stamina of frostbite but yeah please look away if you're arachnophobic
2577620	2586420	we are just gonna blast through this area uh did I come from here uh um I think there's something
2586420	2594580	to look up there maybe I don't know I can't there is a bear ahead I say look away but you're too busy
2594580	2597380	doing something on your alternative twitter so it's okay
2600500	2606180	she doesn't have to know and we are going to take this for some really quick money I believe
2606180	2613620	there is an achievement for holding 100 000 gold at one stage the best way to make gold I have found
2613700	2622180	is by enchanting and selling that jewelry um there is a bit of a mild strat that I devised
2622180	2629060	myself I don't know if it's the strat uh survival mode survival adds the need absolutely not what
2629060	2634740	is this survival adds the need to eat sleep and stay warm it also adds challenges such as no no
2635460	2641220	and no I'm a vanilla skyrim oh my god is that is that pc option
2644580	2651700	um there he goes I just realized am I not am I not getting achievements on xbox for this
2651700	2659780	I don't think I am I'm not aww I named the stream zero to one thousand oops well that's a very accurate
2660740	2667060	run are you playing anniversary um it's an additional challenge oh well we should have
2667060	2672660	gotten an achievement there but we're not playing xbox some dumb imagine having to eat
2672660	2679380	eat 10 cheese wheels um so there is a really easy mine you can clear I think it will give us two
2679380	2685300	handed um that's just dead ahead it's like right in your oh wait actually sorry the standing stones
2685300	2692180	first uh standing stones I believe there are 12 standing stones which give you a certain boost
2692180	2697780	such as a faster leveling exp uh under certain things so there's a mage stone there's a thief
2697780	2703540	stone and there is a warrior stone but there's different ones as well one uh I believe is
2703540	2709380	like a mule stone where you just straight up can carry more items uh on your persons uh yeah literally
2709380	2717540	activate thief activate mage activate warrior uh we are gonna do thief um are we gonna do thief
2717540	2724180	what's warrior I've forgotten right we'll do warrior normally I do thief but we will we're
2724180	2728980	gonna clear out this mine very quickly we're just gonna pick up uh ingredients as we go along
2729780	2734580	the way of the stones the way war yeah this should be an achievement to find them all yes um
2735380	2742580	um well so they're just not have achievements at all because I'm not I'm playing on xbox game
2742580	2751300	pass but it's not like instance to uh xbox uh don't be too afraid of the wolves on the
2752740	2759460	they are too hip they can give you rock join oh I've gone past the mine already they can give you
2760340	2770660	is it no is it rock join or is it lockjaw I think it's rock join oh my memory of me
2770660	2776180	I've gone so past this mineshaft yeah here we go right there should be a baddie out here hello
2777700	2784980	yeah yeah yeah you're playing a novice no I'm not these accusations are unfound
2785620	2793700	it is rock join I thought that but strony where is the blarney and yes I know the blarney stone
2793700	2799620	what are you trying to make a balamori joke there's a tripwire here in this mine but don't
2799620	2806100	worry about it as I said you can please carry them up whatever level you want I like blasting through
2806740	2813380	and just absolutely annihilate and take this like it's so good there are some later stages
2813460	2819780	were even being on easy mode isn't that bad although I have to admit I guess this is registering as
2819780	2827780	PC Skyrim and it's quite different oh this is so sad they made this person mine themselves to death
2828660	2833620	they've had me working down here for days now it's not the time that's getting to me though it's
2833620	2838020	these tunnels I've told this countless times now to add extra support to the weak sections of the
2838020	2842740	tunnel if only we had more of these wooden beams that were we reinforced with bronze
2843540	2847380	honestly if I hear the earth shift one more time above my head I'm so stressed I may stop
2847380	2853300	drinking for good I mean what's a Nord without his mead and he died because of a collapsing
2854260	2862500	so my granddad was a miner and he used to tell me really rough stories about
2863460	2871780	um the he is like being in the mineshaft and all of that uh and they had a mine collapse and
2872500	2878500	within two minutes they had already killed the guy out and he was gone like he just perished it was
2879140	2888420	a main a minor yes um they did I think bandits normally have like a lock pick and coin but
2888420	2896260	that's not really the best um you can't just like straight up grab this shit but there is a big
2896260	2902660	chest in here so we're just gonna clear out the wait unless we oh I was gonna say unless we sneak
2902660	2911380	but the guys right there um yeah but like my granddad used to talk so openly about the um we just
2911380	2919540	got it to stick oh call is oh no hold on everyone knows I'm bad at log picking now um okay we've got
2919540	2930820	our first what are you 20 damage right 20 damage um he like spoke so openly about it and I'm like
2931700	2938100	granddad granddad that's just straight up like stuff that's like man-made like horrors beyond
2938820	2941780	comprehension type stuff uh this chest
2944980	2951860	okay we're definitely on pc because amber does not look like that what the heck
2952740	2959300	what the heck I've never seen that in Skyrim before am I going crazy or I don't know
2959860	2962500	I'm losing it right don't get ready to swing
2965300	2976660	that's so good oh um if the book is valued at 50 coins or more you will level up reading that book
2976660	2981940	if you are ever in a section and you're like what the heck are all these books if that book is valued
2981940	2990740	at 50 uh septum or more then it is actually a skill book oh oh my god that's so satisfying
2991460	3000180	that's so freaking satisfying hold on a minute yeah that's a yeah bone archer
3001860	3008100	um I think there's a tiny little chest on the edge here I think there's a little bug with a
3008100	3015780	difficulty no not at all I'm playing on oh wait it's just in a vein if you didn't know um these
3015780	3021300	are called veins when you can see the ore sticking out from the wall it's quite interesting honestly
3021300	3027460	maybe I should talk about mining because my granddad spoke to me in big detail about it all um
3028900	3034180	and like how they used to come out and like their eyes really bloodshot red and everything
3034900	3038980	have I missed that chest back there I think I have but it's not a big deal
3042260	3047220	yeah I thought that and I just like I was like I've missed that chest haven't I but it's fine
3047220	3051780	if you run with your weapon out your stamina will decrease but that's okay you don't really need it
3052660	3057780	especially when you're just so good at the game like playing legendary mode like as I'm playing
3057780	3062660	right now if you didn't know I'm playing legendary mode like just because I'm such a pro everything
3062660	3068340	becomes really easy and you just have to like understand the strats as long as you like swing
3068340	3077380	first basically you win every fight and the reason why they hardly do any damage to me is because I
3077380	3083380	have such high defense of course and not any other reason if you're looking for work go see
3084420	3092100	um Rayloff said you could help me Rayloff of course you're he's a friend he promised you could
3092100	3100180	help we escaped from the amperials together she lied as easily as she breathes what are you talking
3100180	3109220	about this is legendary mode literally like I know it's hard to believe that a vtuber is just so
3109220	3115540	good at skyrim that they can play legendary mode as casually as I can but it's just it's just the way
3115540	3126980	it is okay so the area is now just discovering that dragons are coming back I don't know why
3126980	3132260	but I actually believe you you've got the look of someone who's just seen the dragon legendary easy

4123620	4130420	happy and satisfied with Skyrim again if the book is worth more than 50 gold if we do the main quest
4130500	4137620	lines instead then I would actually be happy with what we've achieved with Skyrim and we can

4366340	4372900	the scenes um and unfortunately I used my words pretty poorly and it made some of them a bit
4372900	4378340	uncomfortable so I don't really like talking about it too much um but it's due to my poor
4378340	4386900	communication it's not due to the the girls in any way um but I what I can see is that
4387620	4399460	development takes a year at least for a generation like an entire generation if you will um and like
4399460	4405460	I don't want to say too much to make the girls feel like oh I'm just like casting them aside
4405460	4410900	because like oh shiny gen two like you know that's absolutely not the case like I have said this from
4410900	4418420	the start um if there is going to be a gen two it will be at least a year away like I am I am not
4418420	4423460	rushing gens out just for the sake of doing it that's that's so unbelievably disrespectful
4424340	4430580	to the girls who have placed faith in me um and like I still have a load of plans like now that
4430580	4436900	the girls are in the stage of being monetized um there's a lot of plans we can now execute um like
4436900	4441620	shorts as well there's a lot of shorts that need to be made um we have a fantastic uh
4441620	4449460	shorts editor who did a hail mary to the website and applied themselves um and he's he's been a
4449460	4454420	fantastic shorts editor he's pretty much done the majority of the work we have a a second one
4454420	4458980	who's quite busy at the moment but we are gonna you know test if it's all good and if it's all good
4458980	4466020	then you know we've got a lot of shorts play coming up um confirmed not a black company I I hope
4466020	4471540	not I I said to the girls wholeheartedly and hopefully they will voucher they remember I said
4471540	4478020	something along the lines I oh I wasn't paying attention sorry um I said if I ever do anything to
4478020	4486820	you that is like absolutely hurting you that hurts you in any way that is a completely negative
4486820	4493700	experience with me in any way take me out back and shoot me um like it was it's why I was very
4493700	4498580	serious in the interview uh they they are welcome to talk about the interview if they like um am I
4498580	4506260	gonna am I going back the way I came no I'm not um I said to them do not ever refer to me as your
4506260	4512340	boss do not ever think of me as like a superior or something like that um that's definitely not
4512980	4518020	ever how I want you to think like I am literally like in this with you we're we're memeing about
4518020	4524820	we're figuring out what we want to do like um definitely take me out back and shoot me I'm
4524820	4534020	so serious do not ever ever let me like oh that's it does more damage um like do not ever take me
4534020	4539140	like you know what's that saying you live long enough to become the villain don't ever let me live
4539140	4542900	become don't ever let me live long enough to become the villain take me out back and shoot me
4542900	4548020	like oh it's why from the get go like if the girls sign on their contract for another year
4548740	4556420	we the company um we offer an alternative outfit on the house for them as well as their pay increase
4556980	4561860	goes sorry I'm fucking trying to like remember the the attack pattern and where the droggers
4561860	4567300	spawn in this uh we'll talk about this but um like uh we definitely wanted to raise their
4567300	4573060	income and the split goes uh 85 15 again kind of showing that we're not really here for grade
4573060	4579380	we're kind of here for alternative reasons um so is there an actual say oh I don't own the company
4580500	4589780	like I genuinely wholeheartedly my my name I'm basically my role is what is a creative director
4589780	4594260	I already if you look on the thingy it'll tell you what the code is but you just need to move
4594260	4600820	these twice and then you've got the correct code uh unless it's different on pc uh but basically I'm
4601780	4606820	I was the creative director because I did used to have the scripts like I used to be the script
4606820	4615380	maker I no longer have that there's no a manager all I do right now is stream as strone as me um
4615380	4622420	and I send away shorts like I literally went into the girls DMs uh last night like after stream
4622420	4627300	and I was like hey um can I get an audio of you saying this and they're like yeah I'll do it in
4627300	4634180	the morning like that's that's all I do uh you're a cco I don't know what a cco is you're already
4634180	4642980	like the opposite of a black company I mean you're ready to be dragonborn word of power
4642980	4654100	learned force unrelenting force force um there's always an overlord or um some sort of um
4655460	4661780	protector of the words of power which you know makes sense all things considered
4662340	4665060	uh oh we're gonna break that down break it down now
4668100	4676500	uh chief creative officer um no I've uh we're just gonna break everything down and
4677300	4683220	I think there's a hidden chest by this waterfall although I could be completely wrong oh well no
4684580	4688260	damn my memory coming through it's been how many years since I played this game and I'm like
4688260	4691940	yeah there's a we hidden chest here then there's a there and then you can pick this up and then
4691940	4702180	do that oh my god so mlg pro honestly um wow you executed that based on honestly foos sounds like
4702180	4708820	the german word foo which means foot oh did you like my foos last night huh did did you like them
4708820	4716740	streams tell me I don't have I feel so feminine right now I'm like the most feminine I might get
4716740	4722660	more pedicures gonna say that that was so fun I enjoyed it the women was so like both the women
4722660	4728580	were so lovely I felt so flustered in that stream though I hope it didn't come across too badly but
4728580	4736820	I was like so out of my element like when I saw the time was an hour until uh sheepsters was up I
4736820	4741940	was like oh my god what have I done like how did I speedrun it it's like so quickly
4741940	4752420	have you got back the tool um it's still unfortunately very uh cut up so I've still
4752420	4760420	got a wee band-aid on it I washed it uh in the bath uh she got me good all I'm gonna say is she
4760420	4765700	got me good like it was deep you know like the side the smaller side part of your tool cut straight
4765700	4772580	into that she was really sorry though but it's fine like stuff happens honestly and I believe she
4772580	4777780	was new I believe she was new to the establishment so it's better to it's better for her to make a
4777780	4781940	mistake on me because like hopefully I'm nice and understand and they're like I didn't say anything
4781940	4786740	mean I was like oh you're fine like don't worry about it um and like the other women was like
4786740	4790580	translating for her because she didn't speak English and I was like it's fine so I'm kind of
4790580	4795220	glad she made that mistake on me rather than someone else who would have been like a Karen
4795220	4803460	basically like I'm not gonna say anything about Australia but um I have I have heard some unique
4804420	4809220	conversations occur I'm not even paying attention to the plot because I'm too busy rambling about

5017380	5026180	just like that no burnout lucky you I just don't experience it I like I've never experienced
5026500	5033540	issues with that I don't feel it like I can feel tired like I can be like oh I need to go get some
5033540	5038740	like tea and some food and then we'll play like for a couple of more hours I can do that no problem
5038740	5046020	like at all I think the only time I feel I just feel frustrated that I don't have more time like
5046020	5052100	when I was doing all the ASMR collabs like writing all the scripts back to back and actually I knew
5052100	5056580	girl uh I'm used to tell a new girl and I was like hey you want to do some more and she was like
5056580	5061060	fuck you want to do some more and she's like I know a lot about you and I was like oh that's
5061060	5066020	embarrassing um but if you know a lot about me then you know how easy this collab is gonna be
5066020	5072180	because I'll do all the work um but like I don't mind doing all the work if anyone's lurking
5073060	5078260	I don't mind doing the work I actually prefer it um because it makes things a lot easier
5079220	5084420	and make every arrow count I used to not experience burnout playing games but now I do which is a
5084420	5091380	shame no so if you can't play video games that's like life burnout like if you would rather watch
5091380	5097780	someone else play video games then like play it yourself livestreaming doesn't count because you're
5097780	5103860	you're being tortured to watch me play Skyrim via uh my controller where the heck is this dragon
5103860	5113540	is he on the floor oh it is okay oh let's spank his butt uh whoa it's actually kind of hurt me a
5113540	5123700	little bit no you're stinking you're so stinking um see I've been on top here stamina bar is
5123700	5134100	greed out only HP oh it's landed again oh you're hurting me stop it you're hurting me
5134740	5140180	oh look at that two-handed 32 I should probably level that up we are gonna pick up the dragon
5140180	5147060	bones these are like why on earth oh he must eat a weight ring guard um dovahki no
5148020	5153220	uh so now this is where the NPCs get really weird around you I don't know what he's fighting
5153220	5159140	right now he's locked on something a mud crab maybe nearby there's mud crabs over that way
5161700	5168260	today I learned from a Scottish cuttlefish I may have burned out yes so if you'd rather um if you
5168340	5171220	would rather um
5181460	5183460	he's supposed to come up to me is it you
5189700	5196420	normally an NPC walks up to you and goes oh my god you are the dragon born in a really
5196500	5198340	poor like Swedish accent
5202180	5206740	what type of two-handed we specialize in in hammer, axe, sword those there's
5207940	5214340	aren't those one-handed yeah I'm just gonna pick up with the apocrity apocrity something like that
5215140	5219700	did he die I guess they may have perished yeah I've been uninspired by the games to play recent
5219700	5225220	so I'd prefer watching others like yes I think that is a symptom of burnout because of
5227060	5229060	the
5231940	5236100	I think the gray beards have summoned us
5238820	5244100	oh it's Khajiit who's a good boy hey push push push

5286740	5293620	like you always want to hold on to soul gems they're very important may the road lead to oh
5293620	5298020	that's why I always say safe travels land strider because of this game I think is really cute just
5298020	5307860	safe travels land strider khajiit roleplay stream uh I actually don't know how to pur you know how

5350820	5360740	badass horns I'm the dover king known globally you're nobody at home he was so English in those
5360740	5366660	songs for no reason I'm just kidding it is his accent he's allowed to have an accent
5367620	5374900	if it's gosh I'm dover king known globally you're nobody at all like it yeah I think the English
5374900	5383620	rapping accent is a bit better than the scots was the dragon there uh the watch tower was
5383620	5388900	destroyed but we killed the dragon let's just skip a few dialogue and see it turns out I might be
5388900	5398340	dragonborn dragonborn what do you know about the dragonborn when the dragon died I absorbed some
5398340	5405620	kind of power so it's true the gray beards really were summoning you the vampire DLC I don't even
5405620	5411540	think I saw that one the gray beards okay okay okay we get blah blah blah blah wait

5457860	5461700	although I even have soul gem I have the world's weakest soul gem
5462660	5466740	I'm gonna have to refill it so much if I end up using it
5469780	5474820	uh this is the best I can do
5479380	5483060	uh we're just gonna oh we're completely out of soul gems anyway

5527140	5534020	nose and lips and everything that is hilarious I'm so sorry Lydia I'm just such a I must have like
5534100	5541620	subconsciously made her this that shirt is making people nervous on it I'm still winning
5541620	5548980	Lydia cuttles for real for real right we now need to go all the way up this mount well we need to
5548980	5553060	go to Rorik's stead I versus it oh my god I'm such a fake gamer honestly I don't even know why you
5553060	5562020	guys listen to me half the time uh 20's copied my whole flow word for word bar for bar it's a
5562020	5567860	highland coup excuse me little gate let me just close that let me just close that oh it's the wee
5567860	5576820	highland coup look at this no uh whoa whoa whoa look at yidwi horns fun uh I mentioned this other
5576820	5583700	day actually uh I had a relative that owned one and uh the they they're actually super gentle
5584260	5591060	uh but it made my relative blind in one eye lamal uh because the horn poked his eyeball um that was
5591140	5598420	funny uh but he wasn't even mad at her it was a female highland coup I can't even remember what
5598420	5602340	he named there but honestly it sounds like the most Scottish you know I don't care about your
5602340	5610500	question the fuck up um literally I honestly must sound so Scottish a stream like oh my grandad
5610500	5615700	used to work in the mines uh had a family that family member that literally owned a highland coup
5615700	5619540	like oh my god that's where like no wonder I was raised in a bar and literally don't have manners
5619540	5627460	like I just I never had it from the start a wee coup a wee highland coup my favorite part of a
5627460	5635300	strong stream is our unofficial catchphrase did you know oh did you know did you know uh right I
5635300	5640180	think we're gonna manually walk there there are gonna be wolves ahead but because we're playing
5640180	5647220	legendary differently and I'm such an MLG pro at this game um it's honestly not problem and
5647220	5652260	we might even see Cicero on the way it's unlikely we'll meet Cicero on the way there just because
5652260	5659540	he spawns I find the Cicero spawns more northern west of the map and we are her and like going
5659540	5669780	southern east which is the opposite um Lydia no hello this was as stupid as a feud with clan
5670660	5678500	need something no oh oh she's got a bit of them oh what was that shadow freaking the honeybearing
5678500	5684340	meadery ah yes a bit of a bit of meadery oh wait will we open a veal or a meadery why not
5685700	5691620	that seems to be the way of like um content creators when they get in their end game they
5691620	5699780	like come out with a product I'm like I think my end game would be video games like uh like paying
5699780	5706340	to get them made like what what my my rubbish ideas are um I think that's probably my end game whoa
5706340	5714260	okay that was that was a lot going on the screen for one for one soul that was quite a lot there is

5840740	5847460	I know that you can do like 23 and me tests to like really see where you come from but I actually
5847540	5854660	don't uh I don't believe it's safe at all to like willingly hand over your DNA like that look
5854660	5858900	I know I'm starting to send like needy streamer overload where we're doing like that god speed
5858900	5864100	run where she you know she got into like all the conspiracy theories and stuff but it's not really
5864100	5870260	a conspiracy theory right I like maybe I should do a stream like that unironically I'll like yeah

5888420	5895220	you kind of forgot the pronunciation um nah I don't think it's safe either type your DNA
5895220	5905220	on fail the company yeah like um I took like ethics class um and we were discussing like
5905220	5910820	how good like emerging technology is like if you haven't heard about crisper is DNA fixing
5910820	5916660	technology essentially DNA fixing um it's going through a lot of lab studies and trials and all
5916660	5923460	that but it's found very effective against like um you know things that were previously incurable
5923460	5931940	essentially or diseases that are uh untreatable that kind of thing um and the technology that
5931940	5941620	can be raised from it um to help people is outstanding however do we do we trust such
5942420	5949460	do we trust your DNA sequence to be handled with care or would in theory insurance help
5949460	5956180	I'm sorry I'm literally hell yeah I'm up for scotland conspiracy theory stream thank you so much
5956180	5962500	totally not Virginia um like I could definitely get into it but we were like talking about like
5963780	5968420	uh didn't see one of the industry companies get caught selling all the data they said they
5968420	5976340	wouldn't is that yes uh not to mention um there's like a whole rabbit hole about what data leaks are
5976820	5985540	um because um I don't know I don't know if you guys care but um there's actually a whole other
5985540	5992900	conspiracy um that data leaks aren't actually like that it's kind of more like government demands
5993860	5997700	to have access but they already kind of have access so a lot of things especially with the
5997700	6002100	technology in the state age but uh maybe I shouldn't go too far down the rabbit hole don't want to
6002100	6006820	deter anyone where the heck am I supposed to go I think there's a path ahead I'll just follow this
6006820	6013940	path um I thought we were going down the designer baby route oh well that already happened one of
6013940	6020420	the biggest examples of the designer baby route was victoria beckham's children you're telling me
6020420	6027460	that brown eyed lady has a 25 percent of uh blue eyed offspring and she just happened to pop out
6027460	6036260	to blue eyed children uh no she did what is called ivf and then the dna tested and checked if the
6036260	6044260	children and in the egg in the egg yes in the egg uh were able to uh had the recessive blue eyes
6044260	6048820	it has already been done in this day and age and that was back in 2005 or something crazy it's one
6048820	6053620	of the biggest public uh things that are right in the faces of people that you wouldn't know about
6053620	6060260	it's already occurring today this also occurs with the fox p12 gene I believe I'm so sorry if no one
6060260	6064900	cares about this but I'll try and get through it really quickly there's also a gene that's been identified
6064900	6070020	called the fox p12 I believe um and if you have it it means you're actually a lot smarter and able
6070020	6075700	to pick up things a lot easier than someone who is without this gene and it's been called into question
6075700	6080340	that IVF babies may also be getting tested for this so you have a child or offspring that may be a
6080340	6086660	bit smarter than the average girl but that's just on me okay uh I'll just leave it I'll leave it there
6086660	6093780	but there there's a lot there's a lot okay um it's really interesting to continue the
6093780	6098820	happen yes so a lot of people think it hasn't already occurred or the first human hasn't been
6098820	6104740	cloned and dolly the first sheep was cloned in 1964 I believe uh the no no no no no that's when
6104820	6111380	we first were publicly allowed to be learned and to be taught about the cloning um it's already
6111380	6118500	happened long ago you just don't get to know about it because ethnically it's messed ethnically
6118500	6124820	ethically it's messed up and the public shouldn't really be allowed to access this knowledge because
6124820	6130340	well it brings up a lot of questions such as if you clone a person do they have one soul do they
6130340	6134740	share soul and then it brings religion into question if you didn't know religion also helps bring in
6134740	6139460	a lot of order into people's and communities lives and the rabbit hole goes incredibly deep but we
6139460	6143140	can't touch on that subject too much because I'm just a vtuber playing skyrim right now and we're
6143140	6147460	just trying to get to everything so we can talk to the greybeards to learn about our true powers
6147460	6157380	the dragonborn as we play this game so yes please don't mind me uh oh there's a saber cat after me
6157460	6165620	my goodness um but yes uh please uh please let us enjoy skyrim for what it is but anyway that's
6165620	6172340	why I don't really start talking about these subjects uh because uh yeah it's uh it's a bit
6172340	6178820	scary it's a bit scary when you look into it yeah right uh yeah gamers for genetically engineered
6178820	6184180	cat girls represent absolutely I'm 100% there with you the fact that nickel girls aren't real
6184180	6187940	I used to right this sounds really bad I used to actually fantasize about owning a nickel girl
6187940	6194340	I don't know why I just I used to fantasize about like treating her really well and like
6194340	6198340	she would have had a previous owner before me or something but I'll be like I'll treat you right
6198340	6204820	baby I don't know why I give me like some sort of like superior like saving complex or something
6204820	6210340	I don't know why but like I just oh I used to fantasize about all of that like especially
6210340	6221940	after watching monster monster um I used to like really uh there should be a quest
6221940	6229380	where you deliver something for someone is it you here for work get an axe and bring me all the
6229380	6236980	wood you can chop oh okay right sorry jeez um if this dream doesn't demonstrate that the
6236980	6241860	Tism is strong and veiler literally tiffin box there's someone that gives you a quest
6247460	6254980	oh the graybeards 10 not well it's trouble is my legs aren't okay we're gonna yet if you talk to
6254980	6264740	this guy you can do a quest for him um there's also a hidden thing if you read all of these on the
6264740	6268420	way up something happens but I've completely forgotten what happens because I've never done it
6268420	6275540	before because I saw it in a video and I've forgotten what happened in the video uh right let's see

7656180	7665140	crisps uh oh excuse me just going for a swim casually a 500 quid is like literally so good
7665140	7672980	honestly that's like such a big booster start in the game uh right redmond's hall i don't like the

7695300	7699940	yes please i think i will be very satisfied with their skyrim adventures doing that
7701300	7708660	clear cut and we're not kind of stuck with the hill come on there we go uh that definitely because
7709300	7715540	they're freaking actually that's another thing uh toad why make a serena in the first place if

7744500	7750660	child unto me for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear i remember watching
7750660	7759540	that for the first time and just being blown away like i loved everything about her i'm
7760260	7768660	such an edgy little child such an edgy little beast um so i didn't want players to have too
7768660	7774900	much fun and they couldn't keep buying the new versions of skyrim honestly uh there is a forest
7774900	7784340	ahead i think after the forest is uh oh look at the rabbit goodbye oh i made a noise i actually
7784340	7789620	feel bad now i'm not doing that again if it didn't make a noise i'd be all right but because it
7789620	7797300	made a noise i actually genuinely feel really bad feels bad but you know that vampire woman sara
7797300	7805300	i think that's her name she can become human serena why am i so high up where am i
7807540	7812740	oh i'm on the freaking outskirts of the map rifton's here right that'll be why i can't go

8000420	8006980	sedated in nature we're right rifton there's a wolf below me again

8013220	8020180	the world she can't convince me otherwise like right i'm pretty sure if we discover yeah this

8230180	8234340	wants to talk to you at once when you enter rift and i have to admit it's a bit of a sensory
8234340	8239540	bit of a cheeky sensory overload entering in your city and skyrim everyone wants to talk to you
8241380	8249220	right uh how could you possibly know that i'm a thief right i'm gonna tell you something you
8249220	8256020	should absolutely not do maybe you'd like a taste the game is going to ask you to plan a ring on

8266340	8273780	don't do it okay if you do it it removes him as a seller and it's like another 800 coins you
8273780	8278820	can't get from selling stuff these symbols you see around the city um these are thieves guild
8278820	8284260	symbols you'll see them everywhere it means this place has been marked or there's something of value
8284260	8289220	inside like you'll see the symbols everywhere and you always want to fail this quest it doesn't matter

10375480	10385880	probably i'd say an average of five inches deep of this plot um shut up just shut up um i will make
10385880	10389720	a tea and get some food in me because i think i'm starting to go slightly delirious because i've not
10389720	10395320	had anything i'm supposed to be holding a tasting of the new hunting so if he sees the meadery in this
10395320	10404520	state there's currently skeevers and at his meadery and we're gonna offer some well that's not how i
10404520	10413720	operate so you better or i'll yell skeever okay okay no need to make rash decision here's half my only

10483160	10487720	especially for video games like this i might get that change
10490360	10496440	uh spaking the honeybrew mead with emmy needs honestly emmy needs delightfully
10496440	10503080	did emmy would cry for it it's not bad you're no hit legendary i am

10524600	10530120	like going up on screen from that chat box i might change it so it doesn't so the video game isn't
10530280	10535400	um like encroached in any way because i just noticed now that you can't see my health bar
10536120	10543160	um you can see my stamina constantly but my big hairs oh oh sorry there's traps sorry sorry
10543160	10549560	oh sorry sorry oh oh lidia lidia there's traps like did you not just hear me jump over them lidia
10552280	10558840	oh right this fight always scares me because this guy is actually super OP for no reason
10558920	10564760	there's a man in here oh we need to we need to get him first because i have like no magic
10564760	10571960	oh bruv bruv hold on all right i'll get the rats first he is like so strong for no reason
10573080	10578360	and he freaking does that where he fucking backs off i hate when you back off when you're
10578360	10581800	fighting them like i know that's normal to back off when someone's like coming at you
10582440	10587400	but it's so annoying just stand still and let me parachute it's like not that big a deal
10587400	10595160	yeah so that man was currently living with the the skevers um you know as long as he's happy
10595160	10603800	and thriving that's the main thing but uh no a little to the right no no a little to the left
10604680	10608280	a bit more no a little bit more to the left
10609240	10614680	oh he's a mage yeah we hate mages honestly there's so annoying
10618120	10625320	male version of ime oh i mean ow i keep getting wrecked by these traps like i've like forgotten
10625320	10631000	them all right we'll finish this quest and then i will get some food in me because i'm probably
10631000	10635160	moments from perishing uh you can just grab this key but here by the way super easy um
10635400	10640440	um i totally didn't know that on my first playthrough and walked all the way back uh
10641240	10647160	like a dumb dumb no i don't want to steal from it it's honestly kind of picking up stolen items
10647160	10653240	is really annoying if the guards end up picking you up right we've done it we've done the quest
10653240	10658120	once we finish we'll take a look if you need to sample some of the finest mead in skyline
10658920	10664920	that your shift hasn't even started yet when i'm hello well it's about time

10974920	10980680	before complete dump why did the color palette just shift there i could do
10981320	10988040	i blink and you'll miss it honestly here comes airplane i found the same marking at the honey
10988040	10996120	broom eatery you admire them just don't mistake how can we make them pay
10996120	11003880	name is gullama gullama i'm betty get out there shake him down shake him down shake him down
11009720	11016280	uh i need to talk to brinjalph again hi brinjalph i can't believe gullama is mixed up in all this
11016280	11022840	gullama not to be confused with golem a don't get me wrong you could scam a beggar
11022840	11029240	how about i recite the work even more and oh i reduced the work even more and chew it for me
11029240	11035800	do you know that's how um used to food babies back in the day um it's actually really common for the
11035800	11045800	mums to chew the food and then give it to the um sorry um yeah so like before baby formula was a
11045800	11052040	thing and like solid food training or whatever like before the again a capitalism market kind of
11052040	11058280	exploded went to hear about what nesli did um yeah it was like really common your mom
11058280	11062520	chose the food for you and then gives it to you in your mouth it's like a little baby bird moment
11062520	11067400	and everyone's like that's so gross and i was like bro that's the way it is it's just like how how
11067400	11072520	it be you know it's very interesting i actually could probably write an entire video i say about it
11072520	11076920	and then present that video i say live on stream and just to show everyone how natural things are
11076920	11081320	but everything's been so like oh they're so weird but it's only weird because we've not been exposed
11081400	11085720	and we no longer even talk about it because it's like literally unironically being bred out of us
11085720	11092360	over a few generations because capitalism is away um what one fun world stroney did you consider
11092360	11101720	getting mana as backup food yeah mummy bird and literally i didn't know that was a thing it is so
11102280	11110040	um uh babies newborns should start on breast milk because it's full of colostrum um and it's
11110040	11114840	also because a baby doesn't actually have an immune system until six months old um so it's
11114840	11119880	very important to have breast milk however um it was very common to have what's called a wet nurse
11119880	11125800	which is when um a woman who had recently had a child uh would share um because it's very common
11125800	11131720	for some women to experience a surplus and it's very common for some women to experience uh
11131720	11136600	problems producing milk it's just kind of random doesn't really there's a lot of factors that come
11136600	11142040	into play um obviously stress is a major one stress on any human body for a long period do you
11142040	11151080	mind i'm telling a story about tiddy milk leave me alone um but yes uh i'm sure as a lot of you
11151080	11157160	can imagine being stressed for a very long time is very bad for your health um guys uh guys uh
11157160	11163960	stress manifests in a lot of mental health issues and a lot of loneliness um
11163960	11173240	um oh are we gonna make it you know what we're gonna send it send it right hold on hold on
11173240	11176520	let them fake them out a little fake them out fake them out fake them out it's fine
11177800	11185560	wow wait wrong one oh shit i'm out of stamina and he's like right next to me this is rather
11185560	11191720	embarrassing i have to admit uh i didn't really think this far through yeah stress got me pretty good
11191720	11197800	yeah i like it here because i learned so much information okay there we go we can get away
11199080	11204760	worse i hear it i don't see it i think that's good that i don't see it though because it means it's
11204760	11210280	not near me don't call me out like that yeah it's very um interest in the way it physically
11210280	11214760	manifests in the way like obviously i think the majority of us have been like raised in a western
11214760	11220120	society which obviously comes with a lot of socialization and socialization plays so much
11220120	11226680	into the how you can deal with stress factors and like it's just kind of a sad fact that like
11226680	11232520	homeboys uh kind of get told to suck it up um like i can literally go greeting to the girls
11232520	11237560	right now and it's like nothing nothing's wrong with it or anything um but it's very interesting
11237560	11241000	how you tackle it i don't even know how you tackle it i wouldn't even have a clue where you start
11241800	11246600	like the only thing i guess you could hope for is pockets of communities and over time ideas get
11246600	11253720	popular like um when the general consensus of society changes that's when the real change comes
11253720	11259320	through but the problem is you have to basically go out with the old and how do you go out with the
11259320	11266360	old well the the old passes away the old doesn't bring down it bring down the old doesn't pass on
11266360	11272840	its teachings like for example um i like my grandparents talked about how they got hit by
11272840	11277880	their parents um it was a very common place to be hit if you didn't know it's actually illegal
11277880	11284360	to punish your child via a corporal punishment yes your own child in scotland is legal and you
11284360	11289160	will be prosecuted for hitting them no it is not punishment no it is not spanking no it is
11289960	11293720	literally against the law you're welcome to go up and it's very bad for the child
11293800	11303640	there's a lot of things done around it um but it's very fascinating um how quickly things can
11303640	11308200	change within a generation so my grandparents told me stories about them getting hit by their parents
11308200	11314840	they did not hit my parents like they didn't hit mom and dad and then you know opposites i didn't
11314840	11322760	hit mom and dad and mom or dad so my mom spanked me so my dad never hit me he doesn't like it he
11322760	11330680	doesn't believe in it and he absolutely despises it my mom so there was this orange slipper
11330680	11335480	and she used to hit me with it all the time because it was such a low child um
11337160	11345800	but it's very interesting because um within a couple of generations in scotland it's a big
11345800	11351640	no no to discipline your children via punishment like that physical punishment um and it's just
11351640	11356360	like interesting to see as the generations come and go like some people might not like the emphasis
11356360	11361720	like oh if you're in this age range you're gen x if you're in this you're a zoomer you're this you're
11361720	11369240	that but the reason it is so purposeful and so important to have these names for generations
11369240	11380120	is because there's also a lot of societal behaviors that emerge i hear nin root i hear it yes um and
11381080	11388120	uh so like you who are listening to me right now odds are we were not raised in the exact same
11388120	11397320	society with the expectations and whatever's however we are crazy enough to have the ability
11397320	11406520	to set up a community like main where we may agree on how things like should go and how things
11406520	11418440	shouldn't go and we have created a pocket a pocket of a collective that can provide secondary
11418440	11425080	socialization which is crazy because primary socialization is your parents but secondary is
11425080	11430520	like outside outside influence and i could influence you to see the world differently

12225040	12226040	game?
12226040	12230880	Wouldn't that be hilarious if it broke the game and I had to redo it all over it then?
12230880	12234560	Oh my god that would be so funny, please don't do that.
12234560	12238560	Where's my mouse?

12261640	12265640	much for caring to your people's desires.
12265640	12271960	I had quite a bit of spicy time, can't wait to see more of those toesies, oh you'll be
12271960	12284760	excited for tomorrow's stream, oh my god, oh that's funny as anything.
12284760	12291760	I want to him in your curls, my curls, my curled toes?
12291760	12299960	Wow, when you tape you keep your hand on the WASD keys, you're a true gamer, typical
12299960	12303960	people keep it ASDF, do they have that WASD?
12303960	12311120	Oh my god, I can't believe it, I'm a nerd, you've caught me.
12311120	12315360	You have the most beautiful tiny hands in the world, yeah some people said my hands
12315360	12322840	were small, I'm not, I don't actually, I think my hands are the average size for a
12322840	12327520	Whammon, I thought, I don't even think funny, I actually thought I was like bang on average
12327520	12334720	for everything, but I guess I'm not and I'm actually on the smaller side, they are tiny,
12334720	12340000	oh okay, like when I got the ruler out, oh sorry I just punched the microphone, when
12340000	12346880	I got the ruler out I thought that was really fun because everyone can kinda, WASD is natural
12346880	12357120	hand position, yeah I definitely agree with that, mm-hmm, God you have no idea how badly
12357120	12363560	I want to hold my hand, I should come to a convention then, I'll have, I'll get a body
12363560	12372320	guard just to make sure everything's all above ground, but yeah I can bring all damn things,
12372320	12376720	I don't know, I feel like if someone comes to a convention to come see you, I like the
12376720	12381160	idol meetings, like the Japanese idol meetings where they hold your hand and you can talk
12381160	12385360	and look at each other over the table type thing, I think that's really sweet and cute,
12385440	12392960	but I don't know, I don't know, it just seems like something, I dunno, it's just me, mm-hmm,
12395520	12400640	the ASMR booth if only, I wish a convention would entertain me to do that, that's honestly
12400640	12411520	ridiculous, make sure everything's above the table honestly, who would get in trouble first,
12411520	12420480	me or you, me or everyone, let me analyze this one,
12421600	12426560	hey Strony, is there any chance for a hypnosis with helping the listener with addiction
12427520	12432160	or focusing desires upon yourself from distractions, um,
12432320	12439680	oh I'm not sure I can do stuff like that, mine is always of an alternative nature
12440880	12453760	for grat of the defying nature, I absolutely am not qualified or capable or doing anything that
12454400	12465600	kind of has like a, I don't know what the word is, but like I, therapeutic, yeah I would say
12466320	12473440	any therapeutic hypnosis I can't participate in because I don't actually have the knowledge
12473440	12480080	on who goes there, how to do it safely, so safety first I will admit this is out of my
12480960	12485840	league, I am definitely not there and I don't think I ever will be there, um 10 out of 10,
12485840	12491040	9 out of 10, holy moly, oh yeah, oh did you forget when I eat I burp even more, that's right,
12491040	12499600	the air gets trapped in these lungs, eh lungs in this stomach, I gave you my tribute cherry
12499600	12506320	and no one else, you're the only woman to ever, ah
12512720	12516000	these are supposed to be special, I have a mindset in the first place, oh I don't
12516000	12521200	ever feel like forced to or anything, but I do like that, I took your cherry,
12524240	12528240	hi Strony, just finished watching your sweet stream and I have to say those sweets are not
12529200	12534640	as sweet as you, those sweets aren't as sweet as you, hey, oh okay we'll give you that one,
12534640	12540720	that was cute, okay that was cute, every journal joke I know though, also did you know that the
12540720	12545840	bumps on the F and J keys on your keyboard are there so you can correctly place your hands
12545840	12553920	fingers on them without looking or touching, I thought the WASD was funny, I didn't know that,
12554000	12558960	you have taught me knowledge, everyone please finger the F key and notice the bump on the F
12558960	12569360	that is for positioning reasons, and in light of recent events the girls have made it clear
12569360	12577040	they don't want our unfaithful scene, even with your permission if they are reciprocal
12577600	12585440	and dedication, I am happy for them and happy to oblige their wishes, however this means your
12586880	12595840	king will be ignored, my sharing, I'm trying to navigate this in a particular way, I think we
12595840	12606960	all know, I'm trying to get around it, I will just have to, I will have to, I can't say anything,
12607520	12614240	my tentacle is no once again for your exquisite news, oh I love that and only,
12620080	12623840	I can't read anything else over that, there we go finger in the F, yes
12637520	12650000	mmm yes, my sea queen, my sea queen yes, they can entertain my sea queen due to the girls
12651520	12654160	preference, yes
12659200	12663600	oh my god my pc, I don't know if it's because it's on standby but it's making the room
12664560	12671120	unbelievably hot, hi cuddles, during this stream this morning you ask what a fumu was
12671120	12675120	in response to my comment about some plushies, they're basically smug plushies of popular
12675120	12681440	characters from the two whole series, however they have developed a bit of a cult following
12681440	12685520	due to memes and such and ended up with people making their own similar plushies like the
12685520	12690640	Neurosam and Evil Neurosam, oh okay okay from Makership, ah yeah yeah yes I see, I see thank you,
12692960	12699920	am I too big for you, oh that's that's a link, that's a link, we'll investigate that later on,
12701520	12706240	hi Strony, thanks for the fun stream today, a lot of the American sweets did not look safe to eat
12706240	12712400	well but I'm glad you found a new thing you'd like, yeah Makin' Eggs, orange flavor, I'm all about that,
12713360	12719600	I'm all about the Makin' Eggs, I've always had a keen interest in hypno content, I'm very very curious
12721040	12725200	to experience what you have to offer and even more intrigued by the idea of permanent info and
12727120	12731840	I do have a reverse audio that will be publicly accessible, please don't worry, I've always thought
12731840	12737840	that hypnosis would never work on me and I'd like to give it a try, literally you, if it's not for you
12737840	12743600	that's more than okay, I do offer like alternative like audios and stuff that aren't that theme but
12743600	12748560	if it's not for you please don't ever feel forced to like go along with it if that makes sense,
12748560	12753200	like either it's for you, you can give it a try, if you're open minded you'll see,
12758480	12762400	will you give us your best sometime, also you're quite, oh my god I'm choking on my lasagna,
12762400	12767360	you can hear it slide down my throat, also you're quite literally the cutest cop fish I've ever
12767360	12773600	seen, thank you, you make me feel a certain kind of way with that voice of yours, oh yeah yeah,

12792720	12799680	I don't know how to handle this information, pick the other hole, it's really not that,
12799680	12806320	it's not that hard, actually I encourage you very much, please don't worry,

12831120	12835280	if you ever, if ever saw the late day, I would need a new identity, it's not even explicit,
12835280	12840480	I use very loose words, but yeah maybe I shouldn't have brought it up, oh don't be scared to put your
12840480	12845360	creations into the, are you joking me, you know all the scripts that you've heard from the girls
12845360	12851680	so far, I wrote that, do you think I was proud of the first thing I ever wrote, no, don't scrap it,

12888400	12895280	it's the Australian version because the number two is the at key, which is actually the wrong key
12895920	12896720	in the UK,

13159680	13166080	I can't read that one out loud because that's very, that's very, uh, maybe in a membership
13166080	13173840	room, I tried suggesting another man to make you his new Oshi because he was an old-school
13174000	13181840	runescape addict, when he's out of the picture, I'll swoop in on his wife, not that I'm trying,
13181840	13188880	well, what, what are you saying, you're trying to get, what, you're trying to get me an old-school

13193440	13204160	installment, oh, shit, management just showed up, everyone front and center, I, I, I'm serious,
13204160	13207840	you can also contact the website and mention the email you used in the mod application to get it
13207840	13215120	removed, okay, yeah, that seems fair, um, uh, what was I saying, oh yeah, I literally have like 22
13215360	13218400	million gp and all I did was show up in freaking fish,
13224160	13227760	hi cuddles, I'm currently watching the mod of today's ace marstream since I missed it while
13227760	13235520	sleeping, I'm someone who has never been able to go under despite having a, having a flavor for it,
13235920	13240160	so, one issue I have that I become,
13242720	13248960	hysterical, I can't read that, um, uh,
13253520	13255760	uh-huh, okay,
13259120	13263360	okay, we have quite an effect on this replay, that's adorable, I like that,
13264240	13266560	I'm managing with quick hands above desk honestly,
13268320	13275920	hi, I love you mom, I love you to everything, the stream was incredible, I'm really glad that
13275920	13279600	I interest you and I can't wait to see what you do next, also I'm still here and she'd be streamed
13279600	13286160	for you, I'm devoted to you, I really want to send you something, but I haven't had the inspiration
13286160	13292800	been really in my, my emotions lately and it's really slammed my libido, do I know a sad fact,
13292800	13300720	my alternative picture is the last time, rip in the chat, I've been so freaking stressed like
13300720	13309120	all the time and I can't like unstress myself, I think it'll calm down like once the thing
13309840	13312640	but like I'm so freaking stressed and it's such a shame,
13320160	13327040	but I'm sure I will get inspiration soon, I think maybe, I'll tell you what, I think maybe once
13327040	13333280	the monetization for everyone has been achieved, I'll start to feel relaxed because like then truly
13333280	13336960	is up to the girls, whatever they want to do and I can just get fun shorts ordered of them,
13337760	13343120	but like right now I'm like, oh my god there's four out of six, why is the other two not come
13343120	13346960	through because we applied for them all at the same time, like oh no weapons of one of the girls
13346960	13352000	don't get YouTube monetization, oh no that's like a whole month and uh just like oh I don't,
13352000	13356400	oh I would be sick if I think about it, we pretend we do not see,
13356720	13368640	but yeah, the, what did I just say, there's a line of volunteers is extremely long, thank,
13369680	13371520	yeah you guys want to make gentry right now?
13378400	13383600	I've almost finished eating and then I will slurp my honey tea and then we'll get back into
13383600	13402000	the thieves guild, Skyrim's going good, we're at um Gollum from the thieves guild quest,
13402880	13409520	we're about to be meeting the big naughty on who's trying to take down the thieves guild
13409520	13418480	soon to him and then once we do the thieves guild we are going to do the dark brotherhood
13418480	13422960	because I actually really enjoy it, it's quite, I think the dark brotherhood is actually relatively
13422960	13430560	quick um and then we're going to do the vampires and then if we still have time we're going to do
13431360	13437840	um the actual dragonborn quest line which I hate doing because it breaks the game
13438400	13442720	and if you ever like seriously want to do like a hundred percent speed run,
13442720	13446560	eh speed run, not speed run, just a hundred percent achievements, always leave it last
13446560	13453680	because it breaks the game so much when you have to like say like oh we'll give white run up or we'll
13453680	13459840	give this uh rifting up or we'll do this or we'll do that, every detail of how much it breaks the
13459840	13472400	game, but I finished my my bowl of lasagna, um now I've got my cup of tea and my cola, I do, I do,
13472400	13478240	I've got my cola, no need to read this during a stream, oh yeah what happens if I do it right now
13479200	13486960	the ASMR stream was amazing strongy, I was putting your hands during it, ah that's so cute
13487760	13489760	hmm
13492640	13499440	I'm giving you, oh whoa someone is giving me a step by step
13501200	13505440	gate on how to do haptic feedback
13505440	13516000	inalize, inalizing, okay that's the law links, um how down bad do you think is too down bad for
13516000	13519440	you, for me, oh no I like, I like main corruption
13522240	13531040	so there's not really a down too bad, I think corruption's really um up there um oh my first
13531040	13535920	membership stream can be about that, no about ranking everything
13541920	13552480	inalize, yes, oh strongy, I just want to thank you for giving all the girls a home and a family,
13552480	13556960	Vila are such a positive part of the environment already and I'm happy to watch along with all
13557040	13562880	the other reflins, oh reflin, I said also the latest patreon post is incredible,
13563760	13569040	did you like it, I thought it was good, would you let me pick on your party
13571680	13578080	yes if you are a patreon member um another audio has gone up so there's a total of three audios
13578080	13584720	up, um it is spaced out for the other girls so because all the audios were uploaded on the first
13584800	13589760	that did mean there's a bit of a break between the next one that comes up but as it stands
13589760	13602320	everyone has a day, if I can remember correctly Azura, Monday, Mercy, Tuesday, um Emmy, Weddin's Day,
13602320	13616400	Shebe, Thursday, AC, Friday, strongy, Saturday, I'm not quite sure but just so you understand
13616400	13628080	they are purposefully spaced out who goes there and um they will be like every Tuesday
13628080	13634480	all of X's will go out on every Tuesday all of like for me every Saturday an audio will come out
13634480	13642160	like that kind of thing um we I'm going to get the girls to post on what's inside like with the
13642160	13649840	tags and everything I just need catch up time um she says as she's sitting on Skyrim for an
13649840	13655040	endurance stream I've got nothing but the cheek I really do I've got nothing but the cheek but
13655040	13664000	I do need catch up time to get into the floor things then next month um 100% will be like you
13664000	13669920	will see what's inside if you want to subscribe for that month or not and if not then you know you
13669920	13675280	can take a look at whoever else is posting maybe they've got something a bit more up to your style
13675280	13680080	again I would like to repeat when it comes to the audios I have not shoehorned anyone into the
13680080	13688160	same type of plot if you will because that will not financially enable them to be the
13688160	13693440	content creator they'd like to be um a lot of the girls are looking at moving out possibly if
13693440	13698000	they're able to receive enough support so that's why I do say if you only have enough money to
13698000	13706640	support one girl please do pick a daughter of mine because um they are gunning to move out um
13707360	13715520	and it means they would provide more content and yeah it's just a very positive cycle occurs um
13716880	13724960	yes uh yeah I'm both meanies like not bad just to kill it by emoji if you subscribe to everyone
13724960	13731040	you get an audio every day I mean technically you're very close you get a rest day no one uploads
13731040	13739120	on a sunday also they deserve it yes the girls work incredibly hard um AC was like am I allowed
13739120	13744240	someone asked a question to AC on marshmallow like uh how do your recordings work and she was like
13744240	13749360	am I allowed to talk about this and I'm like yeah you can as long as you don't see anything that's
13749360	13755600	like NDA obvious then yeah you can talk about how I I burst into your DMs and hand you a script and
13755600	13760960	all the spelling is wrong and the grammar's whack yeah you can talk about that all you like I say
13763920	13772960	actual day of rest honestly um but yes thank you for thanking me for giving the girls a home
13772960	13780000	but please understand the girls did it themselves they reached out to vealer they applied um they
13780000	13783920	went to an interview and they were happy with everything some of them did the very thorough
13783920	13791120	research uh Emmy actually was the most inquisitive and had the most questions Azura I think she was
13791120	13796160	just like is any of this real I think she thought she was dreaming because she never asked a single
13796160	13804160	question after the interview um yeah Azura was absolutely adorable Emmy asked a ton of questions
13804160	13808720	which made me think she wasn't actually gonna accept the character because I told her what the
13808720	13816480	character's theme was and I saw people were being weird but yeah Azura was like fuck it we ball
13816480	13823520	NDA and the dogs did not withstand and they have carte blanche what carte blanche
13824240	13833760	but what uh in English what in English English that's so Azura honestly yeah this one's like
13834720	13845440	big mommy we ball honestly a free pass or it means like free reign oh carte blanche a blank menu
13846080	13853200	is what the translation is that makes sense a free pass a blank menu oh my god I can't believe it
13853200	13858080	sorry I translated it literally versus uh metaphor good uh
13858560	13865120	hi sending messages scares me but I want I watched your ASMR stream and it was amazing
13865120	13869520	I can't wait to see more of your stuff both ASMR and other videos they're so fantastic I'm watching you
13870560	13876800	do what you love and making ASMR making via lure has me thinking I should start and follow my
13876800	13881680	you should follow your own dreams you've only got one shot I keep snail blinking please Paul
13881680	13885760	please don't notice me snail blinking you do you've only got one shot if you've got a dream
13885760	13891040	or something you want to achieve where can go for it like if I win the lottery already know what I'm
13891040	13897600	doing all I'm saying is if I win the lottery the girls are getting stacked out so I'm saying um
13898560	13904400	you know the split going even higher you know oh it's always fun to try and reach for a new goal
13904400	13909280	like for example hypnosis is my new goal I've always enjoyed it and always liked it but I've
13909280	13913920	never made it myself because like I'm just like not skilled and I need to make sure it's safe
13913920	13919200	and all that sorry I'm trying to wait there's a fucking cat hair on my face and it's one of
13919200	13924160	those cat hairs where you wipe it away and then it does a 360 look back on wherever it's freaking
13924160	13934480	a caption I'm so sorry that'll be gimley honestly um but you honestly you placed everyone in their
13934480	13940960	spots so well I wouldn't picture anyone else yes there is right no I'm not gonna say it because
13941040	13946880	I might start up some shitters um and we ain't stirring the pot from these parts we tap the
13946880	13956640	sign from these parts um let's see hi strongy could you give us a hearing test like hearing
13956640	13966080	test ASMR of course I can do something like that for ya you do a 360 and walk away wait a minute
13966160	13974880	a 180 oops wait no 360 is the circle 180 is the opposite right okay um I could absolutely
13974880	13982320	do a hearing test I did a ear cleaning where I'm like muffled until as the audio progresses I'm less
13982320	13986480	muffled I thought it was pretty cool I need to edit it actually it might be one of my one and four
13986480	13992320	because I owe you four this whole Skyrim stream actually kind of went perfect because tomorrow
13992320	13999200	I will do my monetization celebration stream where everyone can absolutely laugh in I'm pretty
13999200	14004080	sure someone's probably already guessed what I've got planned for it there's no way after yesterday's
14004080	14008640	stream someone hasn't put two and two together and knows why I got a pedicure in particular
14009520	14016880	I refuse I refuse she fell for the oldest these eggs box joke honestly do a 540 believe it
14017840	14024000	um my body prevented me from my dreams so I come about have you ever had an actual medical
14024000	14031120	ear cleaning I've not had a medical ear cleaning but I did get my hearing checked as a child um
14031120	14037680	because I was ignoring my mum where I was undiagnosed it was my idea actually um
14040320	14042720	I'm going to sip my tea before it gets too cold okay
14043680	14052080	eh yeah my mum got me uh sent her a hearing test because she was sitting on my dash she was like
14052080	14057520	scrawny doesn't he listen to me like scrawny scrawny never hears me and I used to do this thing
14057520	14063680	where I sat right in front of the tv so the tv was on a stand but I would sit directly under it so
14063680	14068720	my neck was looking directly upward sorry I just hit the mic there by yeah I know you can't see my
14068720	14075440	hands but my mic was at my mic my neck was directly upwards looking at the tv like pure pure in a
14075440	14083440	trance like straight up like Tism a doctor walked in and Tism was the diagnosis type thing and obviously
14083440	14089040	my mum didn't know what it was all about at the time so I got sent for a hearing test and she was
14089040	14095760	like the wife that did the hearing test on me she was like oh no pet you're here in Spain I don't know
14095760	14103040	what's going on with you um and yeah basically that was that's when the signs start to show
14103040	14108880	and then now here I am someone who has to read and write for a living and goodness gravy is it
14108880	14115600	freaking hard I'm slurping is she okay nah she's just fucking hell autistic
14118640	14125360	a kid with autism how close were you to the tv oh I'm not being funny when I'm like I was
14125360	14133520	directly below the tv I like I was sitting crisscross looking directly up at the tv and my
14133520	14143600	neck was up in the air like and I and my mum ascertained that it was hearing issues rather than
14143600	14149280	something else what might be going on she had a case of strong autism honestly the strong
14149760	14150320	too strong
14153360	14158640	and that's not good for your eyes oh well I do actually need to be wearing my glicks but
14160400	14166000	I'm making it work okay I was right in the vtuber collab scripts and I was like this is too small
14166000	14171200	this takes so I zoomed in and I'm like oh my god I'm gonna be a blind as a fish like really soon
14171200	14173840	wait that's literally me as a kid literally
14173840	14186320	do you reckon cuttlefish have actual autism um as an uncertified marine biologist anything
14186320	14191600	is possible if you didn't know down syndrome is possible in animals as well um I believe
14191600	14202240	down syndrome is the deletion of chrome zone oh god was it in humans uh not 32 that's not right
14202240	14206160	I can't remember which deletion it is but it can happen in gorillas seriously I'm not even
14206160	14211280	kidding look up down soon down syndrome gorilla and like it's fucking creepy oh it's an extra
14211280	14217840	addition of 21 sorry yeah I'm thinking of the deletion one what is the deletion one called
14218800	14226960	that I always watch documentaries about it happens when life deletes 32 yes um actually
14227040	14235520	spindle fiber failure um uh which is I um I find it really interesting oh god yeah I feel like
14235520	14240960	every time I'm like I find this so interesting and fascinating it leads to me rambling about
14240960	14246240	something that you guys couldn't give less of a shit about I feel really bad but at the same
14246240	14251520	time I really like blabbing away so I'm like that just do it that just tell you about um
14251520	14258240	fertilization so the reason why the rate of down syndrome goes up dramatically the older
14258240	14266880	the woman is beyond the age of 25 yes the age of 25 um you're you're already hitting the wall at 25 rip
14266880	14274000	um the reason it goes up exponentially is because the failure of the spindle fibers that's what pulls
14274000	14283440	apart um that's what pulls it apart and then results in a the an additional chromosome wiggling
14283440	14290880	about which is the rise of down syndrome which is why women who um are having children later in life
14290880	14300160	are often advised to do what is referred to as a DNA test which I've completely forgotten the name of
14300160	14306000	but basically they pierce the amniotic sac and take a tiny cell sample of the baby and then check
14306000	14311600	its DNA sequence under um you know get it because to see if the child has done syndrome or not and
14311600	14315440	then either they're advised would you like to terminate or not or bring to term whatever
14316000	14322240	type thing goes on but um it definitely is a risk and uh like also being obese with the child as well
14322240	14327200	results in gestational diabetes which is very dangerous for the child very dangerous for the mom
14327920	14336560	um there's also um if depending on the blood type of the mother and the blood type of the child
14336560	14344800	the mother during the entire pregnancy her body can be attacking the baby until it has a natural
14345440	14351680	abortion if you didn't know abortion is the natural term but you can also get a medical abortion
14352240	14355440	but abortion is the natural term for it just happening
14356400	14361040	there are many reasons why it can never come to term how do you know all this stuff is fascinating
14361040	14367840	no I don't go to school I like watching youtube videos about um biology related things I have a
14367840	14377680	fascination in uh diagnoses in particular like why the reason it occurs for example um like uh
14377680	14384560	there's this syndrome uh of course it evades my mind I think it's called like William Hunter's
14384560	14391200	syndrome where the child or the well the child that can become an adult um because you you do not pass
14391200	14396640	away uh unless you have complications with other diseases for example um you will never experience
14396640	14403360	the sensation of being full uh you will constantly eat um there's like hereditary syndromes as well
14403440	14411840	like hunter syndrome which is pretty uh devastating and um there's interesting one such as dwarfism
14411840	14419360	dwarfism can actually be passed on by two individuals who visually do not have any um display of any
14419360	14428960	dwarf uh ism genetics um but it is a recessive gene and if the two people come together um yep
14428960	14431680	we can have it how do you know all this riefling that obviously has not got the
14432880	14443840	angel man syndrome is that angel man syndrome is that the one where the child is locked in the
14443840	14453520	child like stay I believe so mentally they can't develop any further um uh yes uh Harley Quinn
14453520	14458240	syndrome um doesn't sound like what it is it's where your skin constantly your skin regenerates
14458240	14464640	so fast that you flake and you break and it's just absolute it is a living heck for those poor
14465520	14472880	like children that are born but you can make it to adulthood um there's a lot of sad um
14472880	14478560	diagnoses that you can get like you can get childhood dementia those are quite crushing ones um
14480480	14486160	stroneys institute for the gift to take that angel man is the eaten one is it Harley Quinn
14486160	14494560	it she was this year is dwarf ism classified only as being short there are a redonkulous
14494560	14502560	amount of dwarfism classifications um some can be like no stunted growth on the abdomen uh other
14502560	14510880	versions are no stunted growth on the arms and the legs but the um organ holder area if you will
14510880	14516000	for lack of better words abdomen all the interest in that like there's so many different classifications
14516000	14522960	is quite um it's quite fascinating stuff when she uh get into torso yeah torso will do just
14522960	14528160	nicely uh I remember when the photos of those babies were used as shock for yeah unfortunately um
14530160	14537120	kind of if you use older like if you look up like Freud's stuff for example you get quite a few
14537120	14543440	older photos that are like Freud Freud you didn't have to photograph that mate like you know do you
14543440	14549040	know about prisons yeah like the stanley prison experiment and how people play roles that they
14549040	14557040	perceive to be superior uh absolutely fascinating stuff I do enjoy the psychology I has to offer um
14558320	14568960	I think humans and our everyday socialization were always kind of it's always insinuated that
14568960	14577200	there's someone to look up to but I am a big believer in the three um three perspective
14577200	14582400	talk and it's like parent to parent child to child adult to parent or something like that
14582960	14589200	and it's like the three ways you can communicate with someone he said prions oh not prisons my
14589200	14596640	apology I was talking about the the stanley prison experiment prions uh no a little bit
14596640	14602240	about prions not not not too much sorry I just read what I wanted to read prudder's william's
14602240	14607920	syndrome oh prudder willie syndrome that sounds like um I was mixing them up yes prions diseases
14607920	14615600	are horrifying um did you know about the family of blue people from generations of I know there's
14615600	14623120	a family that's like on youtube because someone goes and films them and they um communicate via
14623120	14627280	barks because they have so many issues it's such a shame
14630640	14634480	I want this woman to yank me for the rest of my life honestly
14636560	14643120	uh well that speaking of prions um what is it rabid racoon bites you what's that called
14644080	14653520	as soon as you develop um water phobia water phobia hydrophobia water phobia once you develop
14653520	14658400	hydrophobia rabies that's it once you develop hydrophobia you have a hundred percent um
14660000	14667360	loss rate uh you can't win it is it is some scary stuff and and to think that we are very
14667440	14673520	lucky to avoid this by getting a simple tetanus shot um it turns out in test was not wincent
14673520	14679040	are you squidding me right now I'm not I'm sorry for the interruption no no barnside note
14679040	14688880	strani teacher outfit when I mean I'm down like I'm I'm down to clone you want strani teach
14688880	14693680	you may be your teacher I'll be your I can teach you a few things

14979760	14982000	okay wait is Babylon just a location then
14987040	14996880	Azura what are you doing in my game Azura what's going on Azura are you going to the high ground
14997760	15001920	what are you doing what are you going to do once you're up here huh what are you going to do once

15009600	15018160	supposed to go Azura is absolutely lagging I'm not I'm no lying she's absolutely lagging it
15019280	15021760	oh I heard that that plot
15024400	15029680	Babylon is the whole horror Babylon thing uh I've been playing too much I
15032880	15038720	oh my gosh right that's it oh I like that
15042480	15048480	okay she can beat him up it's fine I like that he's just dodging and then I just do one big
15048480	15055760	oh that's a steal oh no wait a minute that's against the law I'm a good fantasy role player
15056320	15064240	I broke her stance you know what else I'll break her hi man okay you're done where is it
15064240	15070400	where's the enemy oh he's uh oh I never even saw that man I really do need my glasses on that's
15070400	15077440	terrible legit I thought you were talking about Skyrim's Azura Azura isn't even in the other Skyrim
15078000	15081040	didn't have Azura maybe Azura's star
15082960	15084080	the kind of thing which is
15090800	15091600	wait is this not it
15093840	15098720	hey wait what how come crazy is this not it
15098720	15114560	oh my god I've gone way too far ahead of the plot I've gone way too far ahead of the plot
15114560	15121120	I've not even spoken to the guy to get him to move I was so confused why the trap door wasn't open up
15121840	15127520	oh Azura gets you to clean out her star right you're done I'm not not you're done
15128560	15133520	didn't even get to the the first message I read in chat after like a couple of minutes of combat
15133520	15142880	that's terrible yeah Azura's star is I thought it was on I'm literally speed run the plot I've
15142880	15150080	gone like 10 leagues ahead I do apologize Babel is where humanity teamed up to build a tower
15151200	15161040	to heaven and knocked it down and honestly it's quite interesting how
15163280	15168400	no I can't say that unfortunately um base I'm speed running the plot
15168960	15177360	uh yeah I've been playing too much Binding of Isaac oh my god wait have I said I'm I'm like
15177360	15183280	nine-name percent sure I've actually already said this but some of the girls are into tarot cards
15183280	15190560	they're called um and it's the funniest thing ever and the reason why it's funny is my only
15190560	15196560	exposure to tarot cards is the Binding of Isaac okay which means whenever they're talking about
15197040	15203200	pooling cards or whatever they're like the tower card and I'm like yes yes six bombs six bombs you
15203200	15209040	can probably unlock like a secret um like a tinted rock and get like a soul heart from it yes and
15209040	15213760	like the lovers yes you can get two hearts if you can find a donation machine maybe you can get some
15213760	15219440	coins out of it I'm like oh goodness sake like all of them must be rolling their eyes that my only
15219440	15228000	experience like the friggin the hanged man uh oh yeah um that's fantastic I can uh I can fly in the
15228000	15234960	room like or the full card oh yeah it takes me back to the starting of the the map oh that's amazing
15234960	15240080	that's amazing uh hey I'm just gonna skip this part because I don't really need to see it um
15242480	15246880	can you speak a little bit about your plans for membership no bother you shoot before
15246880	15252720	but you're honestly worth it oh my god stop you're gonna make me blush um I will most likely do two
15252720	15260480	memberships uh streams a week um most likely ASMR membership is probably the most requested I also
15260480	15269280	like doing watch alongs um some stream snap games maybe for more closed things um
15277440	15282640	well oh if you can speak okay it looks like only bribery works on him um
15284000	15290080	two I mean yeah I want to make it worth your money like the way I try to think of it in my head
15290080	15297680	is how much do you pay for like a movie ticket for like one and a half hours entertainment
15297680	15304080	okay I'ma take that and then double it and then double it again so I'm like okay I'll try to stream
15304160	15310800	every single day I'll also try to offer membership streams at least twice a week that seems fair
15310800	15315920	that means in total for the membership not only do you directly support me and future projects
15315920	15322160	gentle and the projects the girls want to pursue soon but we can't talk about any of it yet um
15324240	15332000	and it means like also get like a more I suppose like a more intimate stream experience of people
15332000	15339040	like that um like 17 dollars for a movie ticket that's outrageous um
15340480	15345600	gen two confirmed live on the stream stocks I remember the first time I did this quest I was
15345600	15350800	so nervous about like all the guards coming at me but they don't even care hanged man
15351360	15358080	to we we can go well you do watch together streams for members I absolutely would love to do that
15358080	15364320	yes we can a hundred percent do that gen two spoiled live no clickbait oh you just wait until
15364320	15372800	there's don't a thumb for that if you want to see one of the concepts but not all
15375600	15380640	I don't really talk about it in the server with the girls out of respect because of a
15381520	15386640	a miscommunication on my part and honestly it's kind of easier it's much easier to go
15387440	15392160	you know oh shit my bad you're right then to like explain in mass detail like what the most
15392160	15399200	communication was you know like it is what it is gen two is just she be with a different voice
15399200	15407920	in a real color mm-hmm I'm actually getting her take this a charcoal skin at some point
15407920	15412960	I'm probably do it within the next one I brought in the coin and what not at all we're just skipping
15413040	15420160	through the dialogue that can I be our skin into this look now since our transaction I love
15420160	15429200	the gen two memes but gen one 3d though mm-hmm the girls are all very interested in 3d the problem is
15429200	15440000	I don't know I don't have a heart no sure what can I do for you no
15443920	15449600	you should think about staying the night oh wait I know one of those songs but she
15449600	15455120	doesn't sing it it's Roderick Roderick there's nothing like a good song to lift the spirit sure
15455680	15463360	what can I do for you no there once was a hero named ragnar the rest who came riding to white
15463360	15473760	run from old Roderick then all this ragged and ragged and brandish his blade as he told the
15473760	15486560	vault stories and gold that he made oh I can't remember the rest I need the rest of it it's in
15486560	15494080	another in I said another in she doesn't she doesn't go here right we're just gonna if you
15494080	15498560	want to skip this quest literally just time sink and he will teleport because it's just such a
15499760	15504240	whatever way you go about it you know the 3d will be lit yeah I don't have a clue like
15504240	15511600	they baby had like such a gorgeous 3d model but I'm like 9 in percent sure that shitting vr chat
15512000	15519760	um but I don't know what it is and I'm not sure any of the girls have 3d experience either to
15519760	15525760	help me out the best I can do is like 3d vr chat but I don't know if that's disappointing for them
15526720	15536560	um well maybe ask sin sin is vr chat I asked her and I was quite happy with her model like
15536720	15543920	um and I think that's like what the girls are if they're one 3d like that's all of God you know
15546320	15549760	um I'll be a learning experience for all vr chat streams being created with you know
15549760	15557680	could you imagine aces dg sessions in for your chat yeah it's it's not necessarily a lot of work
15557680	15565040	because I just oh you can't wait in this location damn game forces you east empire company warehouse
15565760	15570400	I wonder if that was by the British Empire British um
15573120	15576960	so this level you're supposed to like alert from this guy but
15578960	15591120	uh yeah I need to offer the girls um what are they called all the trackers but I myself don't
15591120	15596000	actually know what trackers they need and I don't know what the full price point is like I've
15596000	15601280	been really open and honest with the girls and been like obviously once everyone's monetized we
15601280	15606160	can see what kind of money you're earning and if it's good it's bad like because obviously if the
15606160	15612480	girls money's low they're not going to want to stick around are they um so I do have some kind of like
15612640	15618720	um mildly boosting efforts but it's not really
15620720	15627200	yeah you know it's kind of when you're on the managing side it's kind of like I can only
15627200	15631840	do so much with what the girls give me very thankfully the girls are giving me they're all
15631840	15636160	like literally everyone streamed every single day which was insane within reason of course
15636720	15641760	um and like they're taking it a bit more easy this week which I'm very glad to see we do
15643280	15649040	almost I'm a sneak increase yeah or do you think he notices me at all yeah no
15650800	15658080	uh there are some really nice uh things you can do in VR chat I have seen something I didn't
15658080	15665280	what detected me oh oh no he's discovering all the dead bodies along the way but he
15665280	15667440	doesn't find that suspicious like at all
15670960	15676480	I don't know if my my poor heart can take stronti in 3d it would be so fun because you can see how
15676480	15683840	like animated I um I thought about doing a dance 3d stream where like I play music
15683840	15688320	that you guys suggest and like we just dance and drink and stuff I don't know is that weird
15695600	15705440	um just a body nothing so so legit oh well it mustn't be anything um I thought that would
15705440	15710160	be cute like rating your songs and stuff but I don't know how good the tracking is like because I
15710160	15718320	want I want to see my butt jiggle I won't be twerking and stuff I know the year is transparent
15718320	15722080	and it's really endearing how come I draw to making sure everyone eats good both the talents and
15722080	15731200	fun it's right here in my favorite I just uh is he gonna just check to me I mean clearly he just
15731200	15743840	doesn't care if someone go oh um 3d stronti hypnotizes you that'll be interesting like I just don't
15743840	15750080	know how 3d works at all I think vain or like sony notes are the default for most tracking I've seen
15750080	15756560	VR avatars of pendulum and spiral tall everyone just the exception stronti
15763040	15767760	okay so he does a little uh jabate where he actually comes walking back which is why I'm
15767760	15776720	hanging back right now because he's a wee liar um but yeah 3d definitely on the cards we're just
15777680	15784800	obviously we're kind of in the recoup funds stage um and kind of seeing where everyone is of
15784800	15788880	everyone happy like I sent the girls all a message I was like is there anything I can do to make your
15788880	15793280	experience better like how do you feel after your first week and I got like a lot of good feedback so
15794560	15801200	um I'm just gonna be getting ready to get the girls shorts more consistently
15802160	15808880	because it's taking me a hot second to get shorts out I was hoping to at least get them
15808880	15814160	like two a week out right now it's like a one-wing oops and that's just because I suck
15816080	15820960	and I'm gonna fall in the water stronti but don't jiggle jiggle it falls
15823040	15828160	my money don't jiggle jiggle it falls I like to see you wiggle wiggle for sure
15828880	15835680	by the way when our membership expected to become available on tomorrow's stream um
15836320	15844160	I'm gonna get it all set up um and all of that so tomorrow's stream isn't gonna be Skyrim
15844720	15848160	we're not gonna do full achievements because I don't know why my achievements aren't working
15850240	15852720	there are enemies all over here but you can just go swinging
15853040	15856960	you picked a bad time to get lost I think if
15861040	15867440	this is no there is a health potion stacked over there somewhere I remember correctly
15870560	15877040	oh I thought there was a health potion here I guess no it's just Wayne close enough
15877920	15882720	we can sell these potion restraints so there's just spiders in there I don't know if there's
15882720	15888960	anything else you can just go willy nilly through this it's not really um no magic I hate magic
15890400	15895280	I don't want to go I can literally hear that spider in that cave it's membership gonna stream
15895280	15900800	yeah it's tomorrow so the the Skyrim part two is getting steam rolled over to make way for the
15900800	15907680	monetization stream and then I'm like 100% sure you guys know exactly what I'm doing tomorrow
15907680	15917200	it's not even gonna be a surprise at this point um but just yeah this is just gonna be a one
15917200	15923440	off Skyrim because if the achievements were working then yeah but I don't know why they're not so we
15923440	15930880	might actually do calming a bit earlier than expected she be as live again yes she be cotton boom
15930880	15945760	any any cotton boom um oh my god oh he's armored up who's next archer oh
15945760	15957680	I have no idea I'm just stupid to figure out are you wait do you know do you guys wait just
15957680	15963520	take a guess at what you think my monetization stream tomorrow is take a guess and I'll see if
15963520	15971760	you guys know I'll tell you if you got it right or not right where's the guy he should be here
15972480	15973040	oh there is
15975280	15981360	right yeah feet yeah okay feet stream it's feet ASMR I'm gonna have the camera
15982560	15987680	on my feet and because I have decks there in my toes I'm literally gonna hold the ASMR
15987760	15997200	tools with my toes and do like ASMR feet stream that's me yeah feet yeah I like to
15997200	16006640	it's ridiculous I know yeah I know it's ridiculous but I thought it was funny as anything and
16006640	16013360	because my model has like french tip toes I thought like yeah it's perfect I don't think my other
16013440	16018400	toes are gonna heal in time for it though unfortunately it's pretty mangled I don't
16019600	16023600	I don't think I have to go to the doctor I think I have to go to the doctor if it starts getting
16023600	16030960	inflamed you needed to know more now tell you what consider me your new friend in the north
16030960	16035920	I'm keeping the deed any objections consider it again Carlisle didn't even want it why did
16036000	16042880	card like a purchase golden thing now that I know who she maven if if I was maven okay
16042880	16048720	blah blah blah blah blah wait I must have spent a lot of time and resources would be
16051680	16058080	demonetized I mean can you get demonetized it's literally just fee like uh if you kind of take
16058080	16064160	away the ha ha funny from it it's literally just a body part and ASMR and like me is that dog
16064400	16066480	what um I heard that
16069520	16074640	okay gods could you get any more perfect that's the only concept I came up for like my monetization
16074640	16083360	celebration um people walk on their feet all the time yeah like I just think it's more like funny
16083360	16089120	ha ha than it is like anything else but like I this time so I don't keep repeating it but I
16089120	16094240	genuinely like feel so feminine now that I've got like my little manicure pedicure like I felt
16094240	16100000	so pampered like I was completely uncomfortable with the entire situation but I did feel really
16100000	16106480	pampered and I was like oh this is actually kind of nice hold on a minute hold on a minute these
16106480	16113200	gender norms have hands god damn it not again I've fallen for another one it's too difficult

16371520	16378080	chicken head covers just like that's amazing oh my god I would absolutely love to do a stream
16378080	16384720	about the domestication of animals as well think of how many endless animal species we have
16384720	16391680	and there's only I think 11 domesticated species isn't that amazing although there was one russian
16391680	16396880	guy who tried to domesticate foxes and he actually got really far but it does take years and years
16398800	16401520	you can hypnotize a chicken by drawing the line and dirt in front of them
16402320	16407680	oh oh oh I was a little moaned to head there please email them thank you
16409280	16410960	uh there's a little shack down here
16415280	16422400	domesticated foxes would be adorable they would oh there's a bear in this shack I recognize this
16422400	16431200	place from many I totally I've never heard a wolf how old like that before but
16431600	16436080	Lydia can you deal with them so I don't have to slow down I'm trying to make it to the
16437280	16444240	uh location there is probably bandits here actually that's one thing I do have to complain
16444240	16451200	about Skyrim there's like bandits in every freaking place ever literally I've not even approached
16451200	16457120	this landmark and it's like yeah bandits by the way it's like bro I didn't even get a freaking chance
16457200	16462080	to breathe there's always a bear foxes are difficult the worst part is they pee on everything
16463200	16471840	fox girl gen two confirmed made it into pee allure confirmed right there's a stable over here so
16471840	16483680	we're gonna head for it what's the difference between taming and domesticating taming is temp
16483680	16488320	horary friendship whereas domestication anyone can take over with it I think
16489040	16499440	because you can tame a wild hedgehog but you can't domesticate it yeah no that kind of sounds like
16499440	16504720	I'm on the right tracks but I did just I don't actually know the real can you please discover
16504720	16514960	that thank you just sweet time peeler my beloved peeler confirmed by stroney fox girl for peeler
16514960	16523840	lmao let the only reason they're in is because of the the content the girls like to put up
16525520	16530320	domestication is an extremely long process of taming yes I would agree with that statement
16530960	16535040	well they put fast travel on so they had to compensate for people who'd fast travel instead
16535040	16540400	of walk and they need more bandits oh bro every time you want to walk like two centimeters the
16540400	16545840	game's like enemy enemy enemy enemy taming is when you train a wild animal to be friendly around
16545840	16550880	humans domestications when you breed an animal over multiple generations to benefit a human yes
16550880	16561440	so a lot of people don't know that sheep um infinitely grow will that's because of human
16561440	16567120	selective breeding that they produce so much will and they've now required to be shaved
16567120	16571840	like you ever hear those stories that make the news that's like this sheep evaded the farmer for
16571840	16579200	five years and he has five years of like mats on him and the only reason that's actually even mildly
16579200	16584960	possible is because he was bred that way he was bred to produce like copious amounts of wool
16585760	16591200	and and it's like the same for horses you know how horses need little clippy cloppy horses
16591200	16597680	the reason for that is because of selective breeding and and the horse in the wild will
16597680	16606400	naturally wear down its rocks its hooves on rocks and stuff like that and what is going on here who's
16606960	16609520	our key um
16611840	16618400	like yeah silkworms we use for silk can't survive in the wild yeah i would really love to do a
16618400	16627120	domestication thing um i'd love to do a history one i just saw that on a perforx that wolf garden
16628720	16633760	huh i don't think i've ever seen a sheep on the news yeah when you come from scotland sometimes
16633760	16641840	the news is rather bland um you know not a lot going on in scotland if you watch the scottish news
16641840	16652400	oh no he didn't mate why why does the horse who's horse is that hello i'm sorry i'm late
16652960	16660320	good we're finally hydration check i've scouted the ruins and i'm certain carliah is still inside
16660480	16664080	you saw her no i found her horse
16665280	16672320	don't take care of it that horse didn't need to perish let's get moving i want to catch her
16672320	16678880	inside while she's distracted take the lead you want me to lead understood just make certain
16678880	16685360	you keep your eyes open carliah is selectively breeding wiflings to four you can't say that
16685360	16694160	that's hilarious you can't say that oh my god that's so true what the fuck that's so funny i'm
16694160	16707840	sorry i can't even laugh at that that's so funny um i'd rather the news be bland than hyperpolarizing
16707840	16714240	oh i don't even consume the news anymore where where are you bro i can hear your armor what are you
16714960	16720880	okay there you are jeez is everyone because she's growing so much will have actually become a
16720880	16725440	deficient sheep farmers don't make any money from willson synthetic fibers if a police will
16726160	16736560	we have to go back we need to go back please please no more plastic i'd like same i hate watching
16736560	16744640	yeah like it's just unwatchable it just you you'll finish a news broadcast um and you're just like
16744640	16750240	wow i hate life and it was like don't if if you consume things that like genuinely make you
16750240	16756080	more upset at the end of them it's it can be quite addictive and comforting to like watch it in the
16756080	16762880	moment but when you realize it's bad for you like you can just kind of posthump on it you know come
16762880	16769040	back another time uh there are droggers up ahead but it's not anything we can't
16774880	16781200	uh the droggers i'm actually gonna loot them the reason because a lot of droggers drop um
16781200	16785760	um soul gems which i'm needing a heck of a lot more of

16866400	16874400	i'm like going left side i'm like okay there we go so many soul gems okay they just have gold

16889280	16895280	nope don't ask me how long it took me to find the opening to this so my first playthrough
16895280	16904160	it's so painful this was my first ever um skyrim game actually my dad played morrow and um
16905360	16910800	but my my favorite thing about morrowind is that you can just jump on the spot um
16912960	16915520	and then like you level up your stamina it's quite interesting
16918320	16923520	oh i can do this you mean elder school's game yeah wait what did i say my first skyrim game
16924240	16927520	sad oh my dumb dumb

16938400	16943440	something yeah i know you can speak scott but i was curious to know if you knew gaelic as well
16943440	16948560	cause if i remember correctly there's not that many people left in scotland that can speak it
16948560	16953680	no they don't teach us that uh if you come from the mainland you don't learn gaelic at all
16954240	16961200	um it's basically a dying language because they refuse to teach it to the next generation
16961920	16967760	i don't know if it's gonna change i hope it'll change in the future but sadly no i do not speak
16967760	16974800	gaelic which is just how it is they do not teach it and oh pretty shit
16975040	16984640	um but thank you for the tip narrow yes uh very sadly the they don't teach it uh if you're from
16984640	16990400	the mainland of scotland and i am from the mainland of scotland if you didn't know lovely little uh
16990400	17002560	scot wait no did i mean to do that i don't think i meant to do that did i um if i didn't come from
17002560	17008080	the mainland and i came from the shetland for example which is at the north some it's okay
17008080	17013680	if you don't really know scotland that well um where the heck is this red on the map that i get
17014320	17015280	am i going the right way
17018240	17021520	yel skeever okay i'm going the right way i don't know how to do that
17022640	17026640	that's so sad gaelic is one of the very few Celtic languages out left yeah like um
17027200	17031200	uh something's here scotland and ireland and all that were like pagan
17031840	17038560	fucking hell this is a lot of enemies got enemies got a lot of enemies i'm just swanging
17040240	17046720	i'm just swinging around my new ones business honestly me if i was a guy i'd be elephant and
17046720	17050960	that stuff up
17055280	17060240	i'm 42 i'm leveling up faster than my fishing and runescape
17062000	17066560	although you still need a trans a translator for glass region yes the scots is the
17067280	17074800	he just like went flying uh you really wanted that um
17077200	17082880	there's poison darts if i remember correctly yeah i'm just too good i just remember everything
17082880	17091360	honestly um yes i am very lucky that i do have scots at least which is recognized as its own
17091360	17097680	language which is really cool and i know it sounds like i'm like speaking that's because
17097680	17104480	i don't use slang at all like at all um oh we're almost there uh we're almost there
17108160	17108480	um
17112560	17117760	uh i'm completely forgotten what was happening about i hate these guys because they can yeah
17117760	17126000	they can disarm you which i don't like wait he he has special
17129200	17137200	eh i've never seen this before this is not freaking xbox certified flawed barla stone
17137200	17147120	what the heck is that why why did why did pc yell these cool things what the heck is a wireless stone
17148240	17155360	can you do a fool on scottish dream uh i mean if you mean slang i can only really do it for
17155360	17162400	like a couple of minutes because it's just like i get more mumbly and like oh good morning good
17162400	17168640	evening good afternoon and all that who's it going like it just doesn't really sound that good and
17168640	17175120	i don't think it's that relaxing either like and i kind of hate to put it on because my mom was like
17175120	17181840	no then he speaks slang in the house so i didn't and then obviously being an online creator
17182560	17186720	it's the complete opposite everyone wants to hear you with a slang in every hand and it's like oh
17186720	17193520	right then i guess it's a bit uh it's a bit forced because i was discouraged from speaking
17193520	17202000	words these doors have a weakness pc got updates xbox charges per update plus pc got lots of content
17202960	17205360	xbox charges per update i don't know
17208960	17212720	it's just a bit pointless learning gaelic when english is so common yeah like oh
17214640	17221040	i ain't looking good i ain't looking good i'm gonna take a nap right here
17221040	17228800	can you talk dirty scott's if you want

17974640	17981680	i want and stroney did you see what you want yes what i want i submit what i want and then i
17981680	17984560	get back something and then i keep going to the drawing board that's how it works
17987120	17998480	so you're at my mercy shoulda picked mercy you can't purchase in the afterlife gen six
17999040	18007920	absolutely no i am done birthing any children after gen three i mean it's also like uh there's a
18007920	18014320	whole other thing to it there's actually a whole other trust factor as well like gen one i completely
18014320	18019200	trust wholeheartedly um like i did my thorough research on the girls and like when i when i
18019200	18025920	did the interview like i never got any bad vibes or whatever um which sounds terrible like oh you
18025920	18030960	did an interview like an informal interview and went off of was there bad vibes or not and the
18030960	18038960	answer is yeah i did actually um because and when you hear people talk you can get a sense of like
18038960	18045280	especially when they expect it like a super um like a super professional thing and you're just
18045280	18050640	like oh surprise it's actually just me me man uh here's here's the rules type thing um mercy's
18050720	18054720	patreon just went live oh she got an update i can't even remember what her update was
18057040	18062480	i i don't know i don't know what the tags are even though i was the one who put that up there for
18062480	18068080	her sounds like you got a trust you got yeah like i i get described as naive a lot which i
18068080	18072960	honestly don't mind i actually genuinely agree with that and kind of assessment sorry i'm just
18072960	18078560	trying to hit loads of markers along the way so we can just backtrack like this super easily
18079520	18085920	um oh is this like a little hunter's lodge thing going on oh it's like a little campsite oh
18090800	18097040	anyway we eating good tonight after three generations there's a real a real risk of bad
18097040	18106400	actors trying to get in that software yeah so because um i need to choose my words carefully
18107120	18116480	but i hope you can agree with um my my my thought process but it may not be reality because it's
18116480	18126320	just my thought process um it is very plausible that there were vtubers who were interested but
18126320	18133200	didn't apply because they wanted the guaranteed success of gen 2 like to see what gen 1 achieved
18133200	18142000	to see what gen 2 achieved because not that they didn't put their faith in the plan
18144800	18148560	it's not so obviously you want to you want to be a part something that's successful let's
18148560	18156560	wait am i on the right way or am i on the wrong way no i'm gonna write um i need to try and think
18156560	18167920	of my sense just like i'm really happy with gen 1 and everyone is good basically however the rate
18167920	18175120	as you said the rate of a bad actor coming into play does get higher um
18178080	18183760	but hopefully you know there's girls like with you know plenty of experience and i can just
18183760	18191760	see and assess them you don't want to risk the gamble yes it's like i don't know how to say that
18191760	18197840	i just knew all the girls i'm trying to have a really nice moment talking about my girls okay um
18200000	18207040	the risk does get higher when new people are introduced that may not have previous history
18207040	18212480	like um what the heck what am i trying to do where the heck am i trying to go
18214480	18217680	you can't see me um
18221280	18223680	i think you're doing the right thing you don't want to feel like you're even
18223680	18230960	messed up in the wrong thing yes that like um i did speak of someone who applied and then i went
18230960	18236080	on their twitch just to check them out in general and they spoke about how they only want to hang
18236080	18243040	around for one year and then send their audience to their old account and the quote was like because
18243040	18251200	the creator seems so chill or something and i got an in route um and it was just like kind of shocking
18252160	18258080	and it does like kind of slap me back to reality that like people who apply they might not actually
18258080	18264000	want to hang around and achieve like loads of goals they might just do it to go do their own thing
18264960	18271360	the lover stone this always feels the comforts of love all skills improve faster
18272720	18276560	if all skills improve faster then sure call me the lover stone
18278560	18285520	uh who would put that on social me out what wow you know that really happened um
18286720	18291920	they uh applied their application and i pretty much checked out everyone's stream
18292720	18298560	um uh after they applied just to see what they were putting out there because um there was a
18298560	18305680	very notable trend of people applying and then all of a sudden their stream uh consistency ramped up
18305680	18310080	because they were getting assessed and they were aware they were getting assessed uh i don't think
18310080	18317360	i didn't notice that if you were one of those girls um uh there was also stream variety came
18317360	18326400	out of nowhere some people were very glued to one type of game um and all of a sudden uh they
18326400	18341520	start doing a variety of games uh kind of showing that they can play a different um but yes um i did
18341520	18349120	get to experience someone who openly admitted that they basically applied but couldn't care less
18349120	18356160	about the actual longevity of violour and it is quite scary to think that there's a possibility
18356960	18364080	that even through my vetting process um there is a team who also assessed uh the girls that get in
18364800	18376160	as well um and maybe at a later date i can maybe speak a bit more about i think now is a bit too
18376160	18385120	sensitive of a time because obviously it's only been uh one week excuse me sorry just dealing with
18385120	18392960	this guy he is a very bad man do not trust him are you good that man nearly killed me
18393760	18402000	you saved my life oh thank you here well what do we get i think we get a gold band from or something
18404480	18410880	uh why were they after you know i don't have any idea does that affect your judgment what
18411520	18414560	does what affect my judgment i'm so sorry you're gonna have to go over that again
18415120	18421440	sorry i completely forget uh what my like previous sense was azure's voice was too
18421440	18428160	perfect for the character yes i i did admit that if azura did not accept uh i was essentially
18428160	18435040	up shit creek because everyone who applied i was not satisfied with their fit for the voice i did
18435200	18442240	say though i said it before anyone's like uh that's not fair they were born that way they just
18442240	18448000	got in uh what about rooting for the underdog okay you know fuck off um this agency isn't for
18448000	18457280	fucking like sorry i do get a bit passionate like you never fucking cheered for the underdog

19011400	19016400	Just, oh, 20, 20, go, enchanting.
19016400	19020400	That's good, that'll be like enchanting up in here.
19020400	19022400	Just let it out.
19022400	19025400	Okay, we don't really need to, oh, the box, we need that.
19025400	19030400	Mm, is this the barred door?
19030400	19033400	It was!
19033400	19036400	Okay, we've now got the shortcut.
19036400	19038400	So what's this?
19038400	19040400	It's a chest.
19040400	19042400	And then what's that?
19042400	19044400	That's just the other side of the map.
19044400	19045400	Oh my god, we did it.
19045400	19047400	It's not war crime if it's a cute girl.
19047400	19051400	Me committing war crimes?
19051400	19054400	Stop, you're making me laugh.
19054400	19056400	Oh my gosh, I'm so turned around.
19056400	19060400	It's been so long since I've done this.
19060400	19063400	It's called barbarian stealth, honestly?
19063400	19066400	I actually really like that description for my thingy.
19066400	19069400	Like, I've always tried to do...
19069400	19072400	What the heck?
19072400	19073400	Jump shot.
19073400	19075400	Oh, right, wait, what?
19075400	19078400	There's a tic-tac to leave there.
19078400	19082400	I don't think there's any enemies until they come in.
19082400	19085400	We just need to pick up some charcoal and a piece of paper,
19085400	19088400	steal the paper, steal the charcoal.
19088400	19092400	It took me so long to figure out this area.
19092400	19094400	Heavy armor increased to 16.
19094400	19096400	Well, it wasn't really worth the level up.
19096400	19097400	But hey, we did it.
19097400	19098400	I'm gonna break some...
19098400	19100400	Break it down now.
19104400	19105400	Oh, look at that.
19105400	19107400	Look at that.
19107400	19109400	We do have a bow and arrow.
19109400	19110400	Fire damage?
19110400	19111400	Soul trap?
19111400	19112400	Maybe...
19112400	19116400	No, maybe not a soul trap on us.
19116400	19118400	I would say fire damage.
19118400	19120400	Take a little burn.
19120400	19121400	Now, what?
19121400	19123400	Petty or...
19123400	19125400	Bubbish.
19125400	19126400	You know, Seagrog.
19126400	19129400	Method of stealth, honestly.
19129400	19132400	Look, if it works, is there...
19132400	19134400	Is there truly a point?
19134400	19135400	Is there truly a point?
19135400	19138400	Right, so the enemies do come in here.
19138400	19141400	Obviously, because we are playing on legendary mode
19141400	19143400	and I'm just so MLG pro.
19143400	19144400	Yeah, excuse me.
19144400	19147400	We're just gonna one-shot them, confidently.
19147400	19150400	We are just going to one-shot them, confidently.
19150400	19153400	We are just gonna one-shot them.
19153400	19155400	Nice and confidently.
19155400	19157400	No problems.
19160400	19163400	CUTELY commits crimes against humanity, honestly.
19165400	19168400	Have you played Ghost of Toshima?
19168400	19169400	I haven't.
19169400	19170400	One-shot, 100%.
19170400	19171400	Return to the guy.
19171400	19172400	Where's the guy?
19172400	19174400	Is he in here?
19174400	19177400	Oh, return to the guy, guy.
19177400	19180400	Return to the guy.
19180400	19185400	Walk on fire.
19185400	19189400	Why the heck does it make me go backwards?
19193400	19194400	I'm just...
19194400	19198400	The map in is a bit rough.
19199400	19202400	Can I loot this?
19202400	19204400	I can't.
19204400	19205400	They're so good.
19205400	19208400	Wait, are the guards gonna attack me?
19208400	19210400	Are the marker of guards gonna attack me?
19210400	19212400	I think they might.
19213400	19215400	I come back and see you're still in...
19215400	19217400	Eh, no.
19217400	19220400	I'm sorry, but these accusations are unfounded.
19220400	19221400	I'm not a novice.
19221400	19224400	I'm on legendary, clearly.
19224400	19226400	Look, I'm sorry to your untrained eye,
19226400	19228400	but when you get really good at the game,
19228400	19230400	it just makes things...
19230400	19232400	Why did it do that?
19232400	19234400	Why did you do that?
19234400	19236400	Why does the game do that?
19236400	19238400	Honestly, I could fart on it something.
19240400	19242400	Yeah, just because I'm such a high-skilled level,
19242400	19246400	it makes it appear to be a very easy level.
19246400	19249400	So please don't worry about it.
19249400	19251400	No, okay.
19260400	19262400	I've played this game for two...
19262400	19264400	How dare you?
19264400	19266400	Why is the child in the basement?
19267400	19269400	Alright, here's the translation, bro.
19271400	19273400	I'm rubbing.
19275400	19277400	When you're amazing, you make everything look easy.
19277400	19279400	Yeah, legendary.
19281400	19283400	See how that's not valued at 50?
19283400	19285400	It's not going to teach you nothing.
19285400	19287400	Don't open that book.
19289400	19292400	Maybe sometime you should judge a book by cover.
19297400	19300400	Mercer Frey is the baddie.
19301400	19303400	Dun-dun-dun!
19306400	19308400	He's trying to once you rub him.
19310400	19312400	That's actually my specialty.
19326400	19328400	The Nightingales!
19330400	19333400	It seems to describe the failure of the Nightingales,
19333400	19336400	although it doesn't go into great detail.
19336400	19338400	Gallus also repeatedly mentions
19338400	19340400	his strong belief that Mercer desecrated
19340400	19343400	something known as the Twilight Sepulcher.
19347400	19350400	She bawled under that hood.
19351400	19353400	Baw headed in.
19356400	19358400	The annoying hint is actually the bad guy.
19358400	19360400	I'm shocked, colouring me surprised.
19362400	19365400	Golden writing standards by the dev team.
19367400	19368400	Bald!
19368400	19370400	It always annoyed me when you put on a hood,
19370400	19373400	your hair gets removed
19373400	19375400	and annoys me so much.
19377400	19379400	It's just such a...
19381400	19383400	Excuse you, anyone talking to you?
19383400	19387400	Listen, all I want is the truth to be revealed to the guild.
19387400	19390400	They respected Carlaya and she deserves better.
19390400	19393400	Do whatever you can and I'd consider it a personal favour.
19393400	19395400	Sure, thank you.
19395400	19397400	If you ever manage to gain entry to the college
19397400	19400400	and you find trying to rid yourself of stolen goods...
19400400	19402400	He's a fan!
19402400	19405400	I've been known to handle items of questionable interest
19405400	19407400	from time to time.
19407400	19409400	Questionable interest, I like that.
19409400	19411400	We must hasten to rift in before Mercer can do any more...
19411400	19413400	We must hasten to rift in!
19418400	19420400	Bald gent who member confirmed...
19420400	19422400	No! No!
19422400	19424400	Say it ain't so.
19424400	19426400	I will not go.
19426400	19427400	Turn the lights off.
19427400	19429400	Carry me home.
19432400	19434400	Oh my god, members carry okay.
19434400	19436400	I can absolutely wreck my voice on that.
19437400	19439400	I can get beer.
19439400	19441400	I can get beer!
19441400	19444400	And we can do membership karaoke.
19445400	19447400	And I can do song requests.
19447400	19449400	You guys put it together.
19449400	19451400	I'll be pretty good.
19466400	19468400	I'll drink till you spew.
19476400	19480400	Carla currently and kindly explaining the Nightingale lore
19480400	19482400	and her relationship to Gallus
19482400	19485400	whilst I sing that one beer parody song
19485400	19488400	that had that Lego animation.
19488400	19490400	Why are you in the basement child?
19490400	19493400	I'm getting weirded out.
19493400	19495400	Leave me alone!
19495400	19497400	Get away!
19497400	19499400	Creepy wee thing, honestly.
19503400	19505400	And you sing Flare of Scotland?
19505400	19507400	No, I have to be hate music.
19507400	19509400	I'm not singing, I'm getting drunk and going
19509400	19513400	Oh, Flare of Scotland
19513400	19520400	When will we see our life again?
19525400	19530400	I don't know why national songs insist on going so high.
19530400	19534400	Can't you just give me one song
19534400	19538400	where the decibels, the notes in it
19538400	19540400	are just really common
19540400	19542400	and everyone can sing it.
19542400	19545400	Donald, where are your choosers?
19545400	19546400	What's that song?
19546400	19548400	I think I've ever heard of it.
19548400	19550400	I missed beer whilst I was grabbing a drink.
19550400	19553400	No, no, no, we're going to do drunk membership thingy.
19556400	19558400	Back to where I am.
19558400	19561400	I'll take my poops in.
19561400	19564400	I'm ready, let's go.
19564400	19569400	I was going to force us to sing Christmas carols on Christmas.
19569400	19573400	I like a wee and a manger.
19573400	19577400	A wee and a manger.
19577400	19580400	No crib for a pit.
19580400	19582400	Why does it go so high pitch?
19582400	19584400	Why can't they not just have a song
19584400	19585400	down here?
19585400	19588400	No crib for a bed.
19588400	19595400	The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.
19595400	19602400	The cattle are lowing.
19602400	19605400	I was going to force you guys to do
19605400	19607400	freaking Christmas songs with me
19607400	19610400	and then we watch Lord of the Rings on Christmas.
19611400	19614400	Where the winds blow high,
19614400	19616400	where the winds blow to the streets
19616400	19618400	and my cattle go.
19618400	19620400	Although as you say hello Donald,
19620400	19622400	what the freak, I've never heard that.
19622400	19624400	Do you have titsangles?
19624400	19626400	Do they wobble to the floor?
19628400	19631400	I can't say that, I'm sorry.
19631400	19634400	I'm getting a bit delirious, hold on a minute.
19636400	19638400	You've never heard that song before.
19639400	19645400	Do they go to and fro?
19645400	19647400	She's not even drunk yet.
19647400	19649400	Just talking about alcohol is getting me steaming.
19649400	19651400	It's making me lose the plot.
19651400	19653400	No, it can't be.
19653400	19655400	No, it can't be.
19655400	19657400	What's that mean?
19657400	19659400	He quoted the main.
19659400	19661400	The floor?
19661400	19663400	Yeah, it's a bit dirty, we're currently in the sewers.
19665400	19667400	Do they wobble to the floor?
19668400	19670400	Can you tie them in the knot?
19670400	19672400	Can you tie them in a bow?
19674400	19677400	My kami oshi hates Mongolian throat singing.
19677400	19680400	It's because cats don't like the sound of the vibration
19680400	19682400	that Mongolian throat singing provides.
19682400	19686400	So thus I don't like it, I don't like vibrations.
19686400	19688400	That rrrrrrr.
19688400	19689400	No, bad.
19689400	19692400	Cats don't like it, it makes their ears go back.
19692400	19694400	So it makes my ears go back.
19695400	19698400	World's greatest thieves live in a sewer.
19698400	19700400	Down in the sewer.
19702400	19705400	Ever listen to the nasty shrank, please?
19708400	19710400	Let's go.
19710400	19712400	The memer is starting to break free.
19712400	19715400	I want to break free.
19716400	19718400	My cat likes it.
19718400	19721400	Your cat does not like Mongolian throat singing
19721400	19723400	and I will not be taking any further statements.
19723400	19727400	I assure you, your cat does not like Mongolian throat singing.
19728400	19731400	Beast cat, absolutely not.
19731400	19733400	Are you sure about that?
19733400	19737400	Rip project women OST fans and shambles due to the Mongolian throat singing.
19743400	19745400	I was so hard to sing that.
19745400	19748400	Any song is hard to sing, my voice is so frazzled.
19753400	19758400	Can I meet my life away?
19758400	19761400	Sorry, the thieves gold are now just revealing
19761400	19763400	that Mercer has betrayed them for many years
19763400	19766400	and there's not a penny left for them.
19766400	19774400	Meet my life away.
19774400	19777400	Why is Caravans a frog in the stream?
19777400	19779400	Caravans a frog here.
19779400	19782400	I would like to do some karaoke.
19783400	19785400	Sing your cover live.
19785400	19788400	He also like rock music.
19788400	19791400	We doubt you don't like vibrations.
19791400	19793400	I've got an even funner fact.
19795400	19797400	I only like it.
19797400	19799400	Before I help you track Mercer now,
19799400	19802400	I need to know what you learned from Carlya.
19802400	19806400	Mercer killed Gallus, not Carlya.
19806400	19809400	Gallus, Carlya and Mercer were nightingales.
19809400	19811400	Was there anything else she told you?
19811400	19813400	I was behind Golden Glow and Honeybrew.
19813400	19815400	Was there anything else?
19815400	19816400	Say it.
19816400	19818400	I need you to break into my...
19818400	19821400	The magic button cannot handle the vibration.
19821400	19823400	Be careful, just find a way in.
19823400	19825400	But the dark road home can.
19825400	19828400	You have permission to kill anyone that stands in your way.
19828400	19829400	Oh, I have permission.
19829400	19831400	Okay, infiltrate Mercer's home.
19831400	19833400	Oh, everyone's on alert.
19833400	19836400	Alert, alert, Mercer.
19836400	19838400	Alert, alert.
19838400	19840400	All are welcome at the Temple of Mora.
19840400	19842400	Ah, there we are, but you shouldn't be here.
19844400	19846400	I don't doubt for one second.
19846400	19848400	I won't remember that.
19848400	19850400	Please continue.
19850400	19852400	Information stored and saved.
19852400	19853400	Yee...
19853400	19855400	Literally...
19855400	19857400	There's no doubt about it.
19857400	19859400	The tales gilded back.
19859400	19861400	I didn't realize how...
19861400	19865400	Fake speedish that all the voice actors' accents try to mimic.
19865400	19867400	It's actually quite jarring.
19867400	19869400	Be careful.
19869400	19871400	What are you talking about?
19871400	19872400	Hello?
19872400	19873400	Hello?
19873400	19876400	This is Mercer Frey's place and he don't like visitors.
19876400	19877400	Now go away.
19877400	19879400	I need to get inside Mercer's house, please.
19879400	19881400	No visitors, no way.
19881400	19883400	Now piss off before you make me mad.
19884400	19887400	I'll make it worth your while.
19887400	19890400	You ain't got enough coin to make my problems go away.
19890400	19893400	Unless you can talk to Maven Blackbriar and to let me out of my debt.
19893400	19894400	Okay.
19894400	19897400	You try and set one foot in this yard and I'll cut it off.
19897400	19898400	Fine.
19898400	19900400	I'll go talk to Maven about big...
19900400	19902400	Big...
19902400	19903400	Big stinky...
19903400	19904400	What's your name?
19904400	19905400	Bald?
19905400	19906400	More like...
19909400	19910400	Cold.
19910400	19913400	Because it's freezing outside and you're not wearing any outfit.
19913400	19914400	Oh!
19914400	19916400	Absolutely rolled and decked.
19916400	19917400	Hello?
19917400	19919400	America, hiya.
19920400	19921400	No, no, no.
19921400	19922400	American?
19923400	19925400	When's Azura's birthday?
19925400	19928400	I believe it's the 23rd of August if I'm not mistaken.
19935400	19936400	Is she not up?
19936400	19937400	Where is she?
19941400	19942400	He less of a shite.
19942400	19944400	Where's Maria?
19944400	19945400	Big Maria.
19947400	19948400	Okay, hold on.
19948400	19950400	If I put that on, it should show me where she is.
19950400	19951400	Oh, she is here.
19951400	19953400	You were there all along.
19963400	19966400	Sam, if you don't want any of it, I'll take a bell for you.
19967400	19968400	What did he do?
19973400	19975400	Do you think Mercer...
19975400	19976400	Is a cl-
19976400	19977400	What?
19980400	19982400	He's in debt because of a quill?
19994400	19997400	Is this his quill that's in the freaking lake?
19998400	20000400	I believe it.
20005400	20006400	Oh, no.
20008400	20011400	I think it might just be easier to perish this man.
20013400	20015400	I think it's in a boat.
20015400	20018400	Oh, goodness me, it's been many a year.
20018400	20020400	I think it's in a boat.
20020400	20022400	I'm gonna have to look at it on the HUD.
20022400	20023400	Hold on.
20023400	20029400	I want to say it's like somewhere here to the left.
20031400	20035400	Oh, I could be terribly wrong though, but there should be a boat.
20036400	20037400	It started.
20048400	20050400	It's at the bottom of the lake somewhere.
20050400	20051400	Thank you for your help.
20051400	20053400	I really appreciate that.
20053400	20056400	I am somewhere at the bottom of the lake.
20056400	20058400	I don't even have water breathing either.
20058400	20059400	I can't believe you.
20059400	20061400	You had the audacity to take that out.
20061400	20063400	You're just trying to upset me.
20063400	20065400	What's this?
20065400	20067400	What's that barnacles?
20074400	20075400	Wait, wait, wait.
20075400	20076400	Is this a hint?
20076400	20077400	Hold on, let me breathe.
20077400	20080400	Is this a hint that maybe you're around here somewhere?
20082400	20083400	Hold on.
20083400	20084400	Right, should we?
20084400	20085400	Oh, no.
20085400	20088400	Right, well, there was a box, but I guess not.
20088400	20089400	There's rocks here.
20089400	20092400	Is that telling me it's here somewhere?
20092400	20094400	But the barnacles, there's more barnacles.
20094400	20097400	Oh, can you say render distance, please?
20097400	20098400	Stronius, under the water.
20098400	20100400	You don't want reflins.
20102400	20104400	Ah, let me breathe.
20105400	20107400	I seem to think it's like the left side.
20107400	20109400	I saw that storage box.
20109400	20111400	I think that's the game being like hint.
20111400	20112400	It's over here.
20114400	20115400	Okay, hold on.
20115400	20117400	Let me just check again.
20117400	20120400	I think it's in a broken boat.
20120400	20123400	Um, it's on the map somewhere.
20123400	20125400	Right, I'm not reading chat for the next minute.
20125400	20127400	You're on time out.
20127400	20129400	You're done.
20129400	20132400	I seem to think it's close to the edge of the water.
20132400	20134400	Wait, this is a bit too close, clearly.
20134400	20135400	By the bridge?
20135400	20138400	I don't recall it being by a bridge, to be honest.
20142400	20144400	You know what, reflin?
20144400	20145400	What?
20147400	20148400	A strong name.
20148400	20150400	What do you think of the Indiana Jones game?
20150400	20152400	I didn't know there was a new one.
20154400	20155400	Oh, for goodness' sake.
20155400	20157400	I think I'm off the mark.
20157400	20158400	Where am I?
20159400	20163400	Maybe it's like down here a bit.
20163400	20165400	This is the entire area.
20165400	20168400	Okay, I'm just going to do one big loop around the island.
20168400	20170400	Why is there so many salmon?
20170400	20172400	Shoney, I love you.
20172400	20173400	Don't hate my friends.
20173400	20175400	Wait, why would I hate your friends?
20175400	20177400	I thought you weren't looking at us.
20177400	20179400	Look, I forgive really easily.
20179400	20180400	Oh, no, get up!
20180400	20182400	Shabee, what are you doing?
20182400	20184400	Underwater burning.
20184400	20187400	Okay, I don't...
20187400	20189400	think it's up this way.
20189400	20192400	But we're going to just do a big circle
20192400	20195400	for the sake of satisfying myself.
20199400	20202400	Come up for water often.
20204400	20206400	Reflins, remember that Shoney's much of an...
20206400	20209400	as much of an addict as we are.
20210400	20212400	Scuba, Shabee.
20214400	20216400	Shabee, making me nervous.
20218400	20219400	Oh, wait.
20219400	20220400	Maybe I'm on one of these islands.
20220400	20222400	I may be rocked up on a baby island.
20222400	20223400	Do you know that?
20223400	20224400	What the heck was that?
20224400	20225400	I'm rabbit.
20227400	20228400	Hold on.
20228400	20230400	Let's just check the hut again.
20230400	20232400	We're kind of at the furthest point
20232400	20234400	of this section of the lake.
20234400	20237400	I'm not really wanting to go too much further.
20238400	20240400	It's near the box you found before.
20240400	20242400	Oh, my God, I'm actually getting my hand held.
20242400	20243400	See, thank you, refling.
20243400	20244400	I actually get my hand held.
20244400	20246400	And you're just freaking back there.
20247400	20249400	I've gone way off course.
20251400	20253400	Oh, my God, forgive me.
20253400	20255400	Fucking nonchalant.
20257400	20260400	It's between the big island and Riften.
20260400	20261400	That's it.
20261400	20262400	I'm giving in.
20262400	20263400	Skyrimmer's been installed.
20263400	20264400	Are you happy now?
20264400	20266400	Oh, have I put you in the Skyrim mid?
20266400	20267400	Yippee!
20268400	20269400	I can't help the sarcasm.
20269400	20270400	I forget where the thing is every time.
20270400	20272400	In waste half an hour looking also.
20272400	20274400	It's underwater, not on an island.
20275400	20277400	Yeah, it's like crashed off of it.
20278400	20280400	My eyes are currently burning,
20280400	20282400	opening under the salt water.
20284400	20285400	Right.
20286400	20287400	That's not it.
20287400	20289400	These are just textures.
20290400	20291400	It's not like this.
20291400	20293400	I can't even swim in.
20294400	20296400	So there's no point.
20297400	20299400	I'm gonna go buy that box again.
20299400	20301400	If I could find the box again.
20303400	20305400	We'll float to the right this time,
20305400	20308400	not to be confused with the hit TV game.
20308400	20309400	A little to the left.
20309400	20311400	I don't know why I said TV game.
20312400	20313400	Steam game.
20317400	20319400	So those are the barnacles.
20322400	20323400	I'm getting swept up.
20324400	20326400	We're trying to find the quill.
20327400	20328400	That maven.
20330400	20333400	I did not realise how rubbish this game is.
20334400	20335400	Is this for real?
20335400	20338400	There's like two floating foxes under the cave.
20339400	20340400	What's going on here?
20342400	20344400	I can see loads of broken stuff.
20345400	20347400	Hold on, let me breathe again.
20350400	20351400	Right.
20352400	20354400	Definitely not searchable.
20355400	20359400	There's loads of boxes just hanging off the dock.
20362400	20363400	It just works.
20363400	20366400	I think you may have floated over it.
20366400	20368400	It's not by the docks.
20370400	20372400	I like the detail though,
20372400	20374400	the concept that it fell off the boat
20374400	20376400	and they can't retrieve it.
20376400	20377400	That's quite smart.
20385400	20387400	This is where I'm on the map.
20388400	20390400	I'm like messing around here.
20392400	20394400	Isn't this rock formation maybe?
20396400	20397400	What the barnacles?
20398400	20400400	Hold on, let me breathe.
20400400	20403400	I'm like right, I'm like freaking, I'm here.
20403400	20405400	I doubt it got dropped here.
20405400	20407400	It just seems so unlikely.
20407400	20410400	Go straight from the docks towards the island.
20412400	20413400	Okay.
20415400	20416400	Hmm.
20422400	20424400	I'm searching, I'm searching.
20424400	20426400	There's salmon, there's salmon,
20426400	20428400	there's bulks, there's bulks,
20428400	20431400	but it's more towards here.
20433400	20435400	Don't need to breathe, hold on.
20437400	20438400	Okay.
20441400	20442400	Okay, this is new.
20442400	20444400	I don't think I've investigated this.
20445400	20446400	Maybe we have.
20450400	20452400	They have a freaking potion of water breathing
20452400	20454400	that would make this a lot either.
20456400	20457400	Water breathing where?
20457400	20459400	Water breathing.
20459400	20461400	Oh, a whole 15 seconds.
20461400	20463400	Oh, you're too kind, you're too kind.
20467400	20468400	Oh!
20468400	20470400	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
20470400	20473400	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, fucking.
20477400	20479400	Oh, oh, oh, I'm getting current.
20479400	20481400	I'm getting drafted away by the current.
20481400	20483400	Okay, fuck that.
20483400	20484400	Alright, I was doing the new one.
20484400	20486400	Stop, current, stop, I can't breathe.
20491400	20492400	Oh.
20500400	20501400	Ah!
20501400	20504400	I've only got 10 lock picks.
20504400	20505400	Going to be easy on me.
20505400	20507400	I'm going to need to bow some more.
20508400	20509400	No!
20510400	20511400	Less?
20514400	20515400	I'm like...
20518400	20520400	Is that less or is that more?
20523400	20524400	Oh.
20525400	20526400	Give me that.
20526400	20528400	Stupid bastard.
20528400	20529400	Bastard, you're a quill.
20529400	20530400	Right.
20530400	20531400	We did it.
20531400	20532400	Oh my god, that took well.
20534400	20537400	Just get Vol-song and forget about that.
20537400	20539400	What's Vol-song?
20540400	20541400	She's got it.
20541400	20543400	If she can open the box, literally.
20543400	20544400	What's inside the box?
20544400	20546400	That's a freaking quill.
20547400	20548400	You did it.
20548400	20550400	You're the first person in history to buy lock picks.
20550400	20551400	They're so common.
20551400	20553400	I know, I keep forgetting to feel like glue.
20553400	20554400	Hi, do you want a quill?
20554400	20557400	I presume you're bothering me for a good reason.
20557400	20558400	I've found the quill.
20558400	20559400	Really?
20559400	20561400	I wrote that off a long time ago.
20561400	20565400	Well, I suppose I need to fulfill my end of the bargain.
20565400	20566400	Yes.
20566400	20567400	Give this document to Vol.
20567400	20568400	It frees him from the debt.
20568400	20570400	But I never want to see him in Rifton again.
20570400	20571400	Oh, okay.
20571400	20572400	Oh, that's Exile.
20572400	20573400	That's not very nice.
20573400	20575400	He's made his pals here.
20575400	20577400	Do you want to reconsider Exile on someone?
20577400	20579400	That's not very nice.
20579400	20580400	Have you heard of that?
20580400	20583400	Have you heard how damaging that can be to someone's social life?
20584400	20586400	Makes him feel like they're not a part of the community.
20586400	20588400	You have to, you know, uproot and go elsewhere.
20588400	20589400	Not nice.
20589400	20590400	He's trying to suck it at Skyrim.
20590400	20591400	I know.
20593400	20595400	You, come here.
20595400	20597400	I can't talk to him yet or he'll be aggressive.
20597400	20599400	Like, you.
20603400	20605400	Here, over here.
20605400	20606400	What?
20606400	20607400	What?
20608400	20609400	Or Big Vault.
20609400	20610400	Sorry, Big Vault.
20610400	20611400	Oh, oh, he's going to that gate.
20611400	20612400	Hold on.
20612400	20614400	If we're fast enough, if we're fast enough, we can go.
20614400	20617400	We can go talk to him on the other side of that gate.
20617400	20618400	Vault.
20618400	20619400	Vault, hold on.
20619400	20620400	Vault.
20620400	20621400	Vault, it's me.
20621400	20622400	It's me.
20622400	20623400	No, no, no.
20623400	20624400	He's come back to the original position.
20624400	20626400	No, Vault, no.
20626400	20627400	Wait, Vault, wait.
20627400	20628400	Let me talk to you.
20628400	20629400	I just want to talk to you.
20629400	20630400	I just want to talk to you.
20630400	20631400	I just want to talk to you.
20631400	20632400	I just want to talk to you.
20632400	20633400	I just want to talk to you.
20633400	20634400	Vault.
20634400	20635400	Vault.
20635400	20636400	Oh.
20636400	20637400	I have something for you.
20638400	20640400	Here, it's your debt with Maven.
20640400	20641400	You're free.
20653400	20654400	What are you doing?
20654400	20655400	How's he added?
20655400	20657400	Are you just coming out now?
20657400	20659400	Oh, he is.
20659400	20660400	Oh.
20662400	20663400	Okay, thank you.
20663400	20665400	Thank you very much.
20665400	20667400	Can I just come in this way?
20667400	20668400	Oh, it's barred.
20668400	20669400	Wait.
20669400	20671400	I need a bow and arrow.
20671400	20673400	Or can I just hit this?
20675400	20676400	Okay.
20676400	20678400	No, you need a bow and arrow.
20678400	20680400	I was being a bit...
20680400	20682400	Let me just...
20686400	20687400	Tada.
20688400	20690400	That's how you get the ramp down.
20690400	20691400	Super fuss.
20691400	20693400	He's skipping town, no reason.
20696400	20697400	Hmm.
20699400	20702400	I just subbed to all the girls account.
20702400	20703400	Heck, you did.
20703400	20706400	We love supporting genmates out here.
20709400	20712400	Oh, Delinia, you animal.
20712400	20714400	Literally finishing off the kill.
20714400	20717400	She said, nah, I want to be the reason
20717400	20720400	for death on the death certificate.
20720400	20722400	Jeez, Louise girl.
20723400	20726400	The bar is locked in place and cannot be opened.
20726400	20727400	Okay.
20727400	20729400	Uh, any money?
20729400	20731400	Garnet, I'll take you.
20731400	20733400	I can sell it for...
20733400	20734400	some money.
20734400	20736400	Statue of Debala, how about that?
20736400	20737400	Can I move that one?
20737400	20738400	Nope, can't move that one either.
20738400	20740400	Okay, um, I'll just stop touching things
20740400	20742400	in this house then, I guess.
20742400	20744400	I guess I'll go F myself.
20744400	20745400	Wait.
20745400	20746400	What?
20746400	20748400	This isn't the end.
20748400	20749400	Hold on.
20753400	20755400	Right here?
20755400	20757400	Ah, um, yeah.
20757400	20759400	Wait, I'm not touching anything else.
20759400	20762400	Suspicious clothes.
20762400	20764400	Honestly, I wouldn't have figured that out more.
20764400	20766400	Ah, if the game didn't help.
20766400	20768400	Little cheeky alien potion.
20768400	20769400	Oh.
20769400	20771400	Oh, what's this?
20771400	20773400	Oh, I have no idea what this is.
20773400	20774400	That looks like a trap.
20774400	20777400	Lydia, Lydia, Lydia, stop standing on stuff, Lydia.
20777400	20779400	Lydia, Lydia.
20780400	20782400	Oh, I'm getting sliced in days.
20782400	20783400	Hold on.
20783400	20784400	Oh.
20784400	20788400	I'm getting absolutely chopped up.
20788400	20790400	Oh, and there's poison darts.
20790400	20791400	Mine.
20791400	20792400	Goodness.
20792400	20794400	You need to relax.
20794400	20795400	Oh, my God.
20795400	20796400	Mine.
20797400	20798400	Okay, I've got that.
20798400	20799400	What's this?
20799400	20800400	Eh.
20801400	20803400	What even?
20803400	20804400	Why is this book?
20804400	20805400	I have curiosity.
20805400	20807400	What's the contents of this book?
20807400	20809400	I've never actually read it.
20813400	20815400	Lift her tail.
20815400	20816400	Certainly not, kind sir.
20816400	20818400	I am here to clean your chambers.
20818400	20820400	Is that all you have come...
20820400	20822400	Is that all you have come here for?
20822400	20824400	Little one, my chambers.
20824400	20826400	I have no idea what is you, implying master.
20826400	20828400	I am but a poor Argonian maid.
20828400	20829400	Bro, what?
20829400	20831400	So you are my dumpling.
20831400	20832400	And a good one at that.
20832400	20834400	Such strong legs and shapely tail.
20834400	20835400	You embarrass me, sir.
20835400	20837400	Fear not, you are safe with me.
20837400	20839400	I must finish my cleaning, sir.
20839400	20841400	The mistress will have my head if I do not.
20841400	20842400	Cleaning, eh?
20842400	20844400	I have something for you right here.
20844400	20847400	Polish my spear.
20847400	20848400	But it is huge.
20848400	20850400	It could take me all night.
20850400	20851400	Plenty of time.
20851400	20853400	My sweet plenty.
20854400	20857400	I've never fricking read that.
20858400	20859400	Oh, my God.
20859400	20861400	That's hilarious.
20862400	20863400	Many thanks.
20863400	20867400	Not certain how you managed to get your hands on this item we discussed,
20867400	20868400	but I'm more than pleased.
20868400	20872400	I thought you'd simply wait until transported to Castle Devorah
20872400	20873400	to its final destination,
20873400	20874400	but according to what I've heard,
20874400	20876400	it vanished right from their armory.
20876400	20878400	I wish I knew how you were able to slip by the guards,
20878400	20881400	bypass the porticolas,
20881400	20885400	unlock the armory door and break in at the door of a puzzle locked chest.
20885400	20887400	You need to teach me that little trick sometime.
20887400	20889400	I've left your cut in the usual drop spot
20889400	20891400	and might have another drop where you soon are.
20893400	20895400	There's three more books of it.
20895400	20896400	Oh, my God.
20896400	20898400	I knew the books existed.
20898400	20899400	Wait, what am I doing?
20900400	20902400	Egg spare.
20904400	20906400	Can we do it?
20910400	20911400	Okay.
20912400	20915400	But we have it.
20916400	20918400	Easy.
20919400	20920400	Easy.
20920400	20922400	Okay, a bit more, I think.
20922400	20924400	Or maybe it was left, I don't know.
20926400	20927400	Okay, maybe it's left.
20927400	20928400	Do you know that?
20929400	20930400	Easy.
20933400	20934400	Easy.
20934400	20935400	I'm getting nervous.
20936400	20937400	Easy.
20943400	20944400	Alright, we got children.
20944400	20945400	I'll take children.
20945400	20947400	Not a bother at all.
20947400	20949400	Not a bother at all.
20953400	20954400	The rat wave.
20956400	20957400	Let's go.
20963400	20967400	I don't remember what way to go.
20967400	20968400	Is it this one?
20971400	20973400	Oh, no, this is if you want Dragonborn.
20973400	20974400	Oops.
20975400	20977400	Can you stop attacking me?
20977400	20979400	Whoa, your bull.
20979400	20981400	It's an imperial bull.
20981400	20986400	I think an imperial bull is better than what I've got right now.
20986400	20990400	Although mine does have burn damage, so...
20990400	20992400	I wish YouTube had other emotes.
20992400	20993400	I know.
20994400	20999400	YouTube is like very slowly catching up to the appeal of...
21001400	21003400	I'm not doing any more lock picking on that now.
21003400	21007400	YouTube is very slowly catching up to what the appeal of Twitch is.
21007400	21010400	To the point where it is going to take over Twitch.
21010400	21011400	I'm sorry.
21011400	21012400	It just is.
21013400	21015400	Why did I jump down?
21015400	21018400	I've just added so much time to this travel.
21020400	21028400	I did not recall how long it takes to place Skyrim.
21029400	21032400	We're literally not even finished one questline yet.
21033400	21038400	Tear him up, Lydia.
21040400	21042400	Okay, there we go.
21044400	21045400	Emmy's Rats.
21046400	21048400	I'm so confused. Where did that come from?
21048400	21050400	I dropped down there.
21052400	21053400	Okay.
21054400	21055400	There you go.
21055400	21056400	Channel emotes soon.
21056400	21060400	Channel emotes literally less than 24 hours. Have fun.
21060400	21063400	Am I supposed to speak to Brineo?
21063400	21064400	Okay.
21064400	21065400	You know what?
21065400	21069400	If I had that selected, that probably would have gone a lot faster than what I just did there.
21071400	21073400	Underestimating the 1000 plus hours game.
21073400	21076400	Literally, I was like, right, we'll do the Thieves Guild.
21076400	21077400	We'll do Dark Brotherhood.
21077400	21080400	We're literally six hours into this stream.
21080400	21084400	I've less than six hours and I've not even finished Thieves.
21084400	21085400	Oh, sorry.
21085400	21086400	Sorry.
21086400	21087400	I got a bit excited there.
21087400	21088400	I apologize.
21091400	21092400	Okay.
21092400	21093400	Let's do that.
21093400	21094400	How much?
21095400	21096400	How many?
21096400	21097400	How much heavy am I?
21097400	21098400	Curry?
21098400	21100400	Wait, it's 2.18 out of 3.30.
21100400	21101400	That'll do.
21101400	21103400	I need like a hundred stuff.
21103400	21104400	Hi, Carlaya.
21106400	21107400	How long do we have?
21107400	21109400	Yeah, less than six hours because of this.
21109400	21110400	Oops.
21111400	21112400	I'm sorry.
21112400	21113400	I'm sorry.
21114400	21115400	Oops.
21115400	21116400	I'm sorry.
21116400	21117400	I'm sorry.
21120400	21121400	No.
21121400	21123400	Why is two people inviting me to talk?
21123400	21124400	There's too many people.
21127400	21128400	Wait.
21128400	21130400	So do you do every sequel?
21130400	21131400	No.
21131400	21134400	I was just going to do Thieves Guild.
21134400	21135400	Black.
21137400	21139400	Assassins.
21139400	21140400	What?
21140400	21141400	That's not what they're called.
21142400	21144400	The Dark Brotherhood.
21145400	21146400	And then The Vampire.
21146400	21147400	And then The Mean Quest.
21147400	21149400	And I've done nothing yet.
21149400	21151400	So I don't think it's happening.
21153400	21154400	Dark Brotherhood.
21154400	21155400	Yes.
21157400	21159400	Hybrony of Smashes Into Wall.
21164400	21166400	The Trinity of Streams on YouTube.
21166400	21170400	YouTube Shorts of Recycles Clips with 10 Minutes Highlights on the same platform.
21171400	21174400	And also just a cheat for exposure.
21174400	21176400	Yeah, like Twitch is exposed.
21176400	21180400	It's very interesting to see breakdowns on either website.
21180400	21183400	Like, I've just...
21183400	21185400	Meet Karlai at the Sanding Zone.
21185400	21187400	Okay, we're about to become a Nightingale.
21187400	21189400	I know I've literally skipped through all the dialogue.
21189400	21193400	So for anyone who hasn't consumed Skyrim and is listening in at home,
21193400	21195400	I apologize greatly.
21195400	21199400	I can just give you the TLDR.
21199400	21204400	I'm more than happy to provide such a thing for you.
21204400	21206400	How the heck do I get out of this area?
21210400	21212400	I'll just go out of the docks.
21212400	21213400	How about that?
21214400	21216400	I don't think you can jump over.
21217400	21220400	If you haven't played Skyrim, go play Skyrim.
21221400	21222400	Mind yourself.
21222400	21223400	Mind yourself.
21224400	21225400	I'd be a Rifting Guard.
21225400	21226400	I'd be like, yeah.
21227400	21228400	You stink.
21228400	21230400	Don't be causing trouble.
21233400	21234400	Ooh.
21234400	21235400	Hi, Maul.
21239400	21241400	Any news involving the Dark Brotherhood?
21245400	21246400	Oh!
21246400	21247400	That's the other...
21247400	21249400	That's the Brotherhood Quest.
21249400	21251400	Well, that was lucky we talked to him to get that,
21251400	21255400	because we probably just have to kill Grelok the kind.
21255400	21258400	And she's actually not very keen.
21258400	21259400	What's this?
21259400	21260400	Oh, it's a clay deposit.
21263400	21265400	The Thieves Guild quest line is mostly yapping at this point.
21265400	21267400	Honestly, we're about to become Nightingales,
21267400	21270400	and it's about to be yap-yap-yap-yap-yap.
21270400	21271400	I thought I was a good yapper.
21271400	21272400	Mm-mm.
21272400	21274400	Yap-yap-yap-yap-yap-yap.
21274400	21275400	Hello.
21275400	21276400	Hiya!
21277400	21278400	I'm glad you're here.
21278400	21279400	I'm glad you're here.
21279400	21282400	What's the significance of this place?
21282400	21285400	This is the headquarters of the Nightingales.
21285400	21288400	Cut into the mountainside by the first of our kind.
21288400	21289400	See?
21289400	21292400	We've come to seek the edge we need to defeat Mercer Frey.
21292400	21293400	Okay, yeah.
21293400	21295400	What kind of an edge?
21297400	21299400	What kind of an edge?
21299400	21303400	If you'll follow me, I'll try to explain on the way.
21303400	21304400	Yeah.
21304400	21306400	This way, please.
21307400	21310400	Yeah, let's edge this way, please.
21311400	21313400	Oh, look at them steps.
21313400	21315400	Mm, look at that bow, though.
21315400	21317400	Actually, one level.
21317400	21322400	Look at the satchel that the arrow's going.
21322400	21326400	I like how they're coded to look like what the arrow is.
21326400	21327400	Very nice.
21327400	21329400	Very, very nice.
21335400	21338400	I never believed that it existed.
21338400	21340400	I took enough and I'm back.
21340400	21342400	Are you surprised I'm still on?
21344400	21346400	Is Emi streaming today?
21346400	21347400	Emi?
21347400	21348400	Or is it?
21348400	21351400	No, Emi should already be on.
21351400	21356400	Azur should be coming online in two minutes.
21356400	21359400	If I have my times correct.
21362400	21364400	Emi's off today.
21365400	21368400	Just Sheevie and Mercy, so Mercy's on at one.
21368400	21371400	Right, we'll redirect into Mercy.
21371400	21372400	Deal?
21372400	21373400	I'll make you a deal.
21373400	21375400	We'll redirect into Mercy.
21379400	21383400	Yeah, but we're in the Nightingale like Robin Hood or something?
21383400	21390400	I, the first time I did this, like the Nightingale quest,
21390400	21393400	I was in love with Lady Luck.
21393400	21395400	I absolutely just...
21396400	21398400	Ow, I was very loud in my ear.
21398400	21400400	Hopefully that wasn't too loud in your ear.
21400400	21408400	I just absolutely and truly adored the little plot.
21410400	21413400	I like so cool.
21413400	21417400	I just look so amazing and awesome.
21417400	21420400	Everything, I am ready for the oath.
21420400	21422400	Now you go get changed.
21423400	21425400	Best looking armor in the game.
21425400	21429400	Honestly, this armor and Dark Brotherhood armor, yeah.
21429400	21431400	That's awesome.
21435400	21439400	I think we should trust the lass and take the deal.
21439400	21443400	I may have misheard you, but Mercy is in three hours.
21443400	21444400	No one.
21444400	21448400	Yeah, no, Mercy comes online at one o'clock for me.
21448400	21450400	One o'clock in the afternoon, yeah?
21450400	21452400	That's when Mercy comes online for me.
21452400	21455400	So, Mercy's actually perfect for us.
21474400	21476400	An arrangement must be struck.
21476400	21478400	So dramatic.
21480400	21483400	What time did I start streaming?
21483400	21486400	Oh, you started streaming, yeah?
21486400	21489400	At 4 a.m., yeah?
21489400	21491400	I started at 4 a.m.
21493400	21497400	You never wondered why everyone's schedule has a cheeky time zone
21497400	21499400	that no one uses,
21499400	21501400	because that's my time zone.
21504400	21507400	Straining on those night hours, yeah?
21508400	21511400	Yes, I will become Nightingale.
21511400	21513400	Yes, I'm ready.
21515400	21518400	Please stand on the western circle.
21518400	21521400	Holy crap, 4 a.m., yeah?
21521400	21524400	The reason why I stream so early
21524400	21528400	is in case I need to do stuff during the day.
21528400	21533400	Originally, it was either I stream at 4 a.m. or I stream at 10 a.m.
21533400	21536400	But the problem is, if I stream at 10 a.m.,
21536400	21540400	the day is over by the time I finish my endurance streams.
21540400	21545400	So, I wouldn't be able to do doctor's appointments if I need to make it.
21545400	21548400	Lydia, you're going to ruin this so much.
21548400	21551400	Please stand elsewhere.
21551400	21553400	Or just go...
21553400	21556400	Lydia, you're going to ruin this scene so much.
21556400	21558400	I'm not being funny.
21558400	21562400	Come here, Lydia. You're going to ruin the awesomeness of this scene.
21562400	21564400	Lydia.
21564400	21566400	Wait here.
21566400	21569400	Thank you. There's such a beautiful cinematic coming up
21569400	21571400	and they don't know what it is yet.
21571400	21574400	Just let it happen.
21574400	21576400	Oh, not Lydia standing in the corner, right?
21576400	21578400	Just don't look at her. Don't acknowledge her, okay?
21578400	21581400	She's like a dinosaur.
21581400	21584400	Alright, let's enjoy this because this is actually pretty cool.
21592400	21595400	I've come before you to throw myself upon your mercy
21595400	21598400	and to accept responsibility for my failure.
21598400	21601400	You're already mine, Carlisle.
21601400	21604400	Your terms were struck long ago.
21604400	21608400	What could you possibly offer me now?
21608400	21611400	I have two others that wish to transact the oath
21611400	21614400	to serve you both in life and in death.
21614400	21617400	You surprise me, Carlisle.
21617400	21620400	This offer is definitely weighted in my favor.
21620400	21622400	In my favor.
21642400	21644400	I ain't saying none of this.
21650400	21652400	What's the next?
21666400	21668400	Monka.
21672400	21674400	Wait, we don't get to see her?
21676400	21678400	I didn't see her.
21678400	21680400	Norm, I thought we got to see her.
21680400	21682400	I guess it's with the next cinematic.
21682400	21684400	What do you mean, we?
21687400	21689400	Yes, it's true, Crane.
21690400	21692400	He's done more.
21696400	21698400	The Scaly Key.
21700400	21702400	Big Scaly.
21703400	21706400	So the key doesn't lock any doors.
21726400	21729400	The three sounds like no one should possess it.
21732400	21735400	It's too much power for one human to have.
21739400	21741400	We see her when we return the key.
21741400	21743400	Yes, we will do that.
21753400	21756400	First time I've ever set out to return something?
21763400	21765400	Let's go then.
21768400	21771400	Alright, Big Brinny, what's up?
21778400	21780400	Oh my God, he's tapping his feet.
21780400	21782400	Oh, he's doing the Irish dance for us.
21792400	21794400	After we deal with him,
21794400	21797400	all that remains is restoring the guild to its full strength.
21797400	21801400	As a result, there won't be anything that you have attention to.
21807400	21810400	I've been at this game a long time, my friend.
21810400	21812400	A long time. I've stolen trinkets from nobles,
21812400	21814400	and turned priests for murder.
21814400	21816400	I'm good at what I do.
21816400	21818400	Maybe even one of the best,
21818400	21820400	but it's all I know.
21820400	21822400	It's on your words, but your foot is moving
21822400	21824400	and it's making me laugh.
21827400	21829400	It's about time. No, it's not right.
21829400	21831400	I don't know what to say.
21835400	21838400	So don't get sentimental on me now, I accept.
21843400	21845400	We'll handle the details.
21845400	21849400	Oh, we have quite the task ahead.
21849400	21851400	Then let's get to it.
21854400	21857400	What if we try to use the key on strongy?
21857400	21860400	And in playing, you don't have free reign of me?
21861400	21864400	Reef playing, you know me better than that.
21870400	21873400	Lydia, I'm sorry that I put you in exile.
21873400	21875400	Yes, follow me.
21875400	21877400	My thing.
21878400	21881400	I can't believe I made myself Lydia 2.0.
21881400	21884400	Strongy using the key on reefing?
21886400	21889400	It's funny, you think you have any resistance against me.
21899400	21902400	Roy is regaining his own foot in the way he tap him.
21903400	21905400	Here.
21908400	21911400	Oh yeah, becoming the guild master is bugged
21911400	21913400	if you don't do the radiant quest first.
21913400	21916400	Oh, I've always managed to do them after.
21917400	21919400	I don't even know how they...
21919400	21923400	Where the heck do you expect me to go?
21924400	21926400	Eh, let's do that then.
21926400	21929400	Strongy, considering you don't have many lockpicks,
21929400	21932400	it may be beneficial just to hold on to it for a while.
21932400	21934400	Honestly though.
21934400	21936400	Right, I need to go a little to the left.
21936400	21939400	Not to be confused with the hit steam game.
21939400	21941400	A little to the left.
21942400	21944400	Let's get to it.
21944400	21947400	If I can get up this hill, then the enemies in that building
21947400	21949400	won't be able to annoy me.
21949400	21951400	Why would I resist strongy?
21951400	21953400	Exactly, why would you?
21953400	21955400	Anyone who puts up with me?
21955400	21957400	Anyone who puts up a fight gets...
21958400	21960400	Twice as hard.
21962400	21965400	Hopefully you can figure out what the substitute was for that word.
21966400	21967400	That's terrible.
21967400	21968400	Wait, that's north.
21968400	21969400	I'm going the wrong way.
21969400	21971400	No, it's like along the waterfront.
21974400	21976400	And just what?
21976400	21978400	Sounds good.
21978400	21979400	Hi, strongy.
21979400	21981400	Dang, you're going hard into this game.
21981400	21983400	We haven't even finished one quest lane yet.
21983400	21985400	It's officially been six hours
21985400	21987400	and I haven't finished one quest lane.
21987400	21989400	I completely forgot how
21989400	21992400	just humongous what this game is.
21992400	21994400	It's extraordinary
21996400	21998400	that I haven't actually...
21998400	22000400	I'm about to get close to finishing the thieves.
22000400	22002400	But even then, I'm not even going to truly finish them
22002400	22004400	due to the reason
22004400	22006400	of...
22007400	22009400	of what?
22010400	22012400	Of...
22012400	22014400	Because we're not even going to do
22014400	22016400	those miscellaneous quests for the Thief's Guild
22016400	22018400	to restore it to its final glory.
22019400	22021400	Cause...
22021400	22023400	Do I take the lift here?
22023400	22025400	No, I still don't take the lift.
22026400	22028400	Keep the skeleton key for yourself.
22028400	22030400	No, I'll be a good girl
22030400	22032400	because I want to see a mummy nocturnal.
22032400	22034400	I really like her design.
22036400	22038400	I wouldn't mind
22038400	22040400	incorporating...
22040400	22042400	I wouldn't mind.
22042400	22044400	It's a very good design.
22044400	22046400	Now the heck did I get where I'm going?
22046400	22048400	Literally every time I have to go somewhere
22048400	22050400	I just start spamming E on a hill
22050400	22052400	and I'm like, is this where I'm supposed to go?
22053400	22055400	No, I don't really have to walk up the hill yet.
22055400	22057400	No, I don't have to walk up the hill.
22057400	22059400	It's fine. It's fine.
22059400	22061400	I saw that orbing.
22062400	22064400	I'm not sure if I should resist or not.
22064400	22067400	Either way, the outcome is clear.
22068400	22070400	The hard...
22070400	22072400	Oh, I thought it was the wind.
22072400	22074400	It was rules.
22074400	22076400	You don't need the key when you get a log pick into a hundred.
22076400	22078400	Oh, I didn't mean that.
22078400	22081400	Does everything just become easy piece of lemon squeezy?
22081400	22084400	Or do the log picks not break on a hundred or something?
22084400	22086400	We're getting there.
22086400	22088400	We can do it. I believe in us.
22088400	22090400	We're just a little exhausted.
22092400	22094400	I'm scarous.
22094400	22096400	I thought for some reason
22096400	22098400	you said I'm scouse
22098400	22100400	and I was like, right?
22100400	22102400	Now what?
22102400	22104400	Oh yeah, by the way, I'm scouse.
22104400	22106400	I like the way you talk, Scottish lass.
22108400	22110400	You know, right?
22110400	22112400	Can I buy a cheeky Maccas?
22112400	22114400	Wait, Maccas is Australian term.
22114400	22116400	I can't believe it.
22116400	22118400	We're boarding live here today.
22118400	22120400	Today, we are going to...
22120400	22124400	This place is actually covered in bandits.
22124400	22126400	I cannot for the life of me doing Australian accent.
22130400	22132400	Right, what's this?
22132400	22134400	A gate. Open the gate. Why not?
22134400	22136400	That might come and help me
22136400	22138400	with future...
22138400	22140400	Go on a Maccas run, yeah?
22140400	22142400	Get in void with me, yeah?
22142400	22144400	Oh, I thought I was going to one-shot you.
22144400	22146400	I'm going to be honest.
22146400	22148400	Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can beg for mercy
22148400	22150400	when you're dead.
22154400	22156400	P-pop-pop...
22166400	22168400	Oh, I bonked him. Right, give me that.
22168400	22170400	I will destroy that.
22170400	22172400	What is this? Can someone look this up?
22172400	22174400	What am I supposed to do with this?
22174400	22176400	Flawed Var-la Stone.
22176400	22178400	I don't know what it is.
22178400	22180400	Flawed Var-la Stone.
22180400	22182400	I've never seen them before.
22182400	22187400	before PC seems to have them, Xbox doesn't seem to have them.
22187400	22189200	But Mercedes in three hours!
22189200	22190800	Say a shout out to Mercedes!
22190800	22192600	Sorry, I got a lot of gold itch on my head.
22192600	22195000	I like to see them.
22195000	22198700	Speak to Carlaya.
22198700	22202800	Ooh, they got a good look.
22202800	22207800	Expert is about much, I've done that for souls.
22207800	22210500	Right, the machines drop.
22210500	22214700	Where's Lydia?
22214700	22217000	Lydia, you do this all the time.
22217000	22220300	There should be an enemy that pops out of here, yeah.
22220300	22221400	Oh, that's right, I remember.
22221400	22224600	These guys used to treat me out.
22224600	22227600	I'm actually, I'll tell you what, that was like really loud.
22227600	22231200	I'm going to...
22231200	22235800	...settings, audio.
22235800	22237600	Is that a bit better on your ears?
22237600	22243500	I feel like whenever that happens, it's so loud.
22243500	22246800	A new hand has touched the beacon.
22246800	22248200	Now, these do drop, yeah.
22248200	22253300	That's exactly what I'm wanting, like tons of these soul gems.
22253300	22254000	Where's the enemy?
22254000	22255500	I love the enemy.
22255500	22257400	Just got an enemy.
22257400	22259300	Ooh, hold on.
22259300	22260900	My two hands is 46.
22260900	22264600	We're getting there, we're getting there.
22264600	22266200	Yes, oh my goodness.
22266200	22269800	This is what we want, like massive amounts of these soul gems.
22269800	22273300	And then we can put like really good stuff on.
22273300	22277600	There should be one that pops out of here.
22277600	22278600	Yeah.
22278600	22279900	Oh, I'm getting too good.
22279900	22283400	I'm genuinely too good at this game, I'm sorry.
22283400	22286200	The fact that I remember from childhood,
22286200	22288900	where the enemies like come out.
22288900	22295000	I'm not sure how scared I was with the enemies.
22295000	22295900	Come here.
22295900	22297500	Okay, there we go.
22297500	22299500	What was that, three to scavenge?
22299500	22302800	Oh, I'll take it, I'll take it.
22302800	22304200	I'll take it, I'll take anything.
22304200	22308200	I'm happy with anything, any offerings I'll take.
22308200	22312100	Oh, yeah.
22312100	22315000	Is the enemy from here?
22315000	22317000	Here.
22317000	22318900	Oh, I heard that.
22318900	22327100	I heard them like spidering up here.
22327100	22333300	I can hear enemy.
22333300	22339600	Oh, I heard two just one in there, but I need to go here.
22339600	22342900	They're so tiny.
22342900	22346500	They're so tiny.
22346500	22348800	Oh, we are getting so many soldiers.
22348800	22352100	This is exactly what I was needing, one of the runs in here.
22352100	22358400	That spawn sneak is actually impressive.
22358400	22364800	Ah.
22364800	22367900	There, them.
22367900	22369400	Okay, we can destroy that.
22369400	22374600	Yeah, let's go.
22374700	22378200	Alchemy, Arvin.
22378200	22381800	Yeah, yeah, I'll take the potions, let's go.
22381800	22387400	Oh my god, I just jumped in real life because of that noise of that latch.
22387400	22389600	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
22389600	22392900	Oh, hello.
22392900	22394500	I hope you aren't too late.
22394500	22398100	Oh, those bandits back there.
22398100	22400900	Dot, dot, dot.
22405200	22406500	Mm-hmm.
22406500	22409400	I had the brap lever literally jump scare of me.
22417400	22420300	Oh, he really got me there, didn't he?
22420300	22422700	Oh, soul gems.
22422700	22427400	We love soul gems, soul gems, soul gems, soul gems.
22427400	22428900	Oh, wait, is this the thing?
22428900	22430100	I'm supposed to watch him.
22430100	22431600	Look, there he is.
22431600	22433500	Look through the bars.
22433500	22435700	I'm trying to, where is he?
22435700	22439400	I'm pretty sure he pops out somewhere here.
22439400	22442500	And this is a, this is an instance report.
22442500	22444600	I've returned to continue watching.
22444600	22447500	Where?
22447500	22449200	Oh, there he is, there he is.
22449200	22450000	That's Mercer.
22450000	22451700	Look, I'm crawling over.
22451700	22454800	Look at this little cinematic.
22454800	22456800	I like how they just expire right now.
22457300	22467800	Oh, they didn't even move a sword.
22467800	22472000	Eyelash, and we'll be ready for him.
22472000	22474200	Man, the FOV is so low.
22474200	22475500	Do you get motion sickness?
22475500	22478600	No.
22478600	22481000	I'm very lucky, Mercy says she gets motion sickness
22481000	22482900	playing video games.
22482900	22485800	Not to be dramatic, but I think I would end it.
22485800	22490800	Oh, God, I think there's a farmer around here.
22490800	22492100	What's this?
22492100	22494000	Potions.
22494000	22495200	Lutions and potions.
22495200	22498000	I do love a good, I do love a good collection.
22498000	22499500	Isn't there a farmer here?
22499500	22500600	No?
22500600	22502100	Empty?
22502100	22503600	Oh, found him.
22503600	22505900	Found him.
22505900	22508700	And I have course of poison.
22508700	22512500	What does he draw?
22512500	22514500	Skibertail, nah, you're good.
22514500	22518800	You, I want your soul gems.
22518800	22521100	Who am I perishing?
22521100	22523600	Why is Mercer such a poofy poofy?
22523600	22525100	Oh!
22535200	22538900	I just smacked myself into a wall at low health.
22538900	22540500	Okay, that'll do.
22540500	22543100	I think I'll be okay now.
22543100	22548700	That was a jump scare and a half.
22548700	22550000	Okay, we're fine.
22550000	22550700	We're fine.
22550700	22551400	We're fine.
22551400	22554900	Actually, it's probably really good that I have that on a panic
22554900	22558900	because it gets me away from the enemy really quickly.
22558900	22559900	The heck is this?
22559900	22563800	Let's just stop.
22563800	22567000	Oh, I need to go up.
22567000	22571400	Excuse me.
22571400	22577000	The freaking blades on the ground took all my eggspear.
22577000	22582400	Are we having a troll?
22582400	22586600	That's, eh?
22586600	22589700	And where's the other lever?
22589700	22592900	Excuse me, Brynjolf, you're just smacked me in the...
22592900	22595700	That's the other lever there?
22595700	22598400	Behind an eggspear?
22598400	22600700	That can't be right.
22600700	22602700	Surely not.
22602700	22609000	But it is.
22609000	22610400	That can't be right.
22610400	22611600	Don't you have the skeleton key?
22611600	22617900	No, we've not done that part.
22617900	22623600	But that is it.
22623600	22626900	Well, good thing I don't have a smurf it, but what?
22626900	22627600	Wait.
22627600	22631400	Oh, that's not the lever at all.
22631400	22636600	Where the heck's the first lever?
22636600	22640300	Is it here?
22640300	22641800	Where's the second lever?
22641800	22646400	Reveal yourself.
22646400	22647800	What?
22647800	22649000	Oh, there it is.
22649000	22651700	Oh, it's adjacent to the other lever.
22651700	22653800	Oh my god.
22653800	22656300	Then you can go all the way back again.
22656300	22658600	Out my way, out my way, out my way, out my way.
22658600	22660000	I'm not that fast.
22660000	22661600	I'm not that fast.
22661600	22663200	Hold on, hold on, I need to cheat.
22663200	22664400	I'm not that fast.
22664400	22674000	I was gonna say, putting something behind an eggspear level thing is wild.
22674000	22674800	That wasn't it?
22674800	22677200	Okay, I was gonna say that has to be it.
22677200	22680800	I refuse.
22680800	22684400	A little cheeky chess.
22684400	22691700	I'm being trolled by this game.
22691700	22695500	I'm being trolled.
22695500	22699300	I'll destroy that, and then I can get more thingy.
22699300	22700500	Are we there yet, bruv?
22700500	22701200	I feel the same.
22701200	22703600	We've literally not even finished one quest line.
22703600	22706300	I'm ready to make another cup of tea.
22706300	22710800	All right, you can stealth this area, but I'd rather just go for it.
22710800	22713800	I'd rather just go for it.
22713800	22721700	Earthquake, cheeky bit of an earthquake.
22721700	22723000	By the Pope, who's there?
22723000	22725200	Identify yourself.
22725200	22729600	There is a chess down below, but I'm not really fast right now.
22729600	22733800	I want to finish one quest line.
22733800	22737100	One quest line is all I ask.
22737100	22738100	Stop it.
22738100	22741800	You're so stinky.
22741800	22742400	Okay, hold on.
22742400	22743200	You got something.
22743300	22744500	Shaman's key.
22744500	22745000	What was this?
22745000	22748000	The shaman's key, dude.
22748000	22749500	Oh, is it for that?
22749500	22749800	You know what?
22749800	22752600	I might be the chest.
22752600	22753400	No, it's not.
22753400	22754800	Well, I'm not looting it then.
22754800	22755800	Go away.
22755800	22759100	I don't know what the heck the shaman's key is for.
22759100	22761200	Clapham stinky lining, honestly.
22761200	22762500	I mean, how do you come back from that?
22762500	22763600	Someone calls you stinky.
22763600	22765800	You have no way of coming back, truly.
22765800	22766600	It's over for you.
22766600	22768400	Just admit it.
22768400	22770800	There's traps everywhere.
22770800	22773800	Isn't there a massive Centaurian coming up?
22773800	22780400	My brains just reminded me that there's like a big enemy coming soon.
22780400	22783200	What does that say?
22783200	22785400	Bruv, the game thinks I can read that?
22785400	22787700	Mercer, it's backwards.
22787700	22792400	Mercer is on the bottom.
22792400	22797100	One, two.
22797100	22798400	Why is that backwards?
22798400	22800200	I can read Mercer as backwards.
22800200	22802600	I don't mind the stinky.
22802600	22804400	I don't mind the wise.
22804400	22805700	What, an air?
22805700	22810200	Why is it backwards?
22810200	22812600	I'll take these scrolls because I can sell them for money.
22823600	22825800	This is very real.
22826800	22831700	Oh, dear.
22831700	22836600	Right, can you jump the Centaurian and not me, maybe?
22836600	22839600	Oh, goodness, gravy.
22839600	22842400	Some of these enemies.
22842400	22844800	Am I right, fellas?
22844800	22848200	Oh, my fellas.
22848200	22849900	Oh.
22849900	22852200	Oh, hold on.
22852200	22856200	Hold on, right, there you go.
22856200	22857300	All right, I should probably go to sleep.
22857300	22858200	See you next time.
22858200	22859700	Rest well, those who sleep.
22859700	22862800	Please don't worry if you do need to go to sleep again.
22862800	22864600	Bit of a cheeky endurance stream.
22864600	22868200	Mercer is going live in T-minus less than three hours.
22868200	22874300	We are going to raid Dinter because my Skyrim escapades got cut short
22874300	22878900	due to the fact that, oh, I am moving so fast.
22878900	22881700	I am successfully avoiding all the traps laid out.
22881700	22887000	Yes, I don't know why achievements aren't popping up.
22887000	22893200	I'm literally using Xbox Game Pass right now, so it's kind of the...
22893200	22899800	I'm not sure what the dealio is, but I'm quite happy just to play through the...
22899800	22906700	Thingamabobber and tomorrow's monetization celebration.
22906700	22911800	So I guess I can enjoy like a more relaxed for my boys.
22911800	22914800	Oh, come on.
22914800	22916900	Oh, come on.
22916900	22919500	Get a rest.
22919500	22920400	Oh, I'm low health.
22920400	22921000	Oh, I'm low health.
22921000	22922500	I'm about to get altered by a spider.
22922500	22924400	Hold on.
22924400	22928100	Okay, there we go.
22928100	22931000	Go around to read it.
22931000	22932700	Go around it to read it.
22932700	22935900	Oh, is there like another room that makes a lot more sense
22935900	22938200	if there was like something behind it?
22938200	22943300	Me here just ignored it and chose to be confused.
22943300	22944200	Oh, give me that.
22944200	22945700	Oh, orcishbowl and ice.
22945700	22947800	Oh, and alchemy.
22947800	22952600	Resurrect and restore my energy.
22952600	22956000	Mmm.
22956000	22960600	Alchemyxing like a DJ.
22960600	22963800	Give me them juicy soul gems.
22963800	22965000	That's all I want.
22965000	22966100	That's all I crave.
22966100	22969800	I just want soul gems.
22969800	22971700	Oh, I might get one of you.
22971700	22973900	No.
22973900	22975400	Okay, okay.
22975400	22977300	You guys don't need to perfectly follow me.
22977300	22978600	You do realize that, right?
22978600	22980900	But we can do this.
22980900	22988500	And we completely missed them because we alerted the enemies to our location.
22988500	22989800	Okay, there we go.
22989800	22990500	Oh, my God, he's beat.
22990500	22994300	He jumped in me.
22994300	22995300	I'm actually beating that.
22995300	22996400	I wasn't beating him.
22996400	23000200	God, they have so much venom.
23000200	23003900	So much venom.
23003900	23004600	Don't mind if I do it.
23004600	23006700	What on earth were they doing?
23006700	23010200	Sheebie, what have you been doing in your dungeon?
23010200	23012000	These last words?
23012000	23013100	Oh, my God, that's brutal.
23013100	23015300	Hold on.
23015300	23017900	These last words.
23017900	23019400	Nobody thought they were real,
23019400	23022000	but I've seen them in the eyes of the snow elves.
23022000	23026800	The dwarves thought they took them from the Thawmer,
23026800	23028100	but they themselves were fooled.
23028100	23030600	A statue built in secrecy by the slaves.
23030600	23031800	The eyes burn into you,
23031800	23033700	and I see them even now.
23033700	23036200	Sarafa escaped through the collapsing tunnel,
23036200	23038000	but he'll never escape what we've seen.
23038000	23039300	Men will never believe him,
23039300	23042700	and he'll be driven mad by the knowledge that he'll never see them again.
23042700	23048600	But I may yet see them again before I die.
23048600	23051800	Wow, that was strange.
23051800	23053400	Johnny's a soul gem addict.
23053400	23056700	Literally, they're like the most OP leveling up system.
23056700	23058200	I'm just going to blast through this area
23058200	23066700	because there's a massive flamethrower, I think, or something.
23066700	23069200	How am I detected if I'm around the corner?
23069200	23071100	Why are you going for me?
23071100	23075500	He's right there.
23075500	23077500	Literally, right.
23077500	23080900	Actually, I just remembered Mercer drops are really good.
23080900	23085300	Two-handed sword, and we already got children.
23085300	23089000	Yeah, that's right. Spank that rat on the fire.
23089000	23092600	Oh.
23092600	23096500	Oh, let's go.
23096500	23099200	Oh, my fellows.
23099200	23100300	Oh, I'm getting...
23100300	23104700	Yeah, okay. I was the same kind of blasted by this.
23104700	23110500	We may yet to see Johnny's eyes before we die.
23110500	23115100	I might need to heal.
23115100	23121100	Or I might get a wave of thought.
23121100	23122300	Ooh, we've been...
23122300	23123200	Oh, I got detected.
23123200	23124800	I keep going, like, all right.
23124800	23127100	I'll finally go sneak, and then I get detected
23127100	23132500	because I'm not paying attention.
23132500	23134100	Touch this.
23134100	23136100	Eat this.
23136100	23138400	Fun fact, the Dwemer and Elden Scrolls are not doors,
23138400	23140100	but actually, a type of elf.
23140100	23141100	Two-handed.
23141100	23143100	He isn't a drill wielder.
23143100	23144900	Exactly.
23144900	23146400	Imagine not being a drill wielder.
23146400	23149300	I can't relate.
23149300	23151700	I've tried so many times to be an archer,
23151700	23153800	but I just can't do it.
23153800	23156300	Like, especially when the enemy come up in your face
23156300	23157700	and you've got a bow and arrow,
23157700	23162400	it's like, bro, wouldn't actually be so furofuro.
23163000	23167500	I think that actually does more damage to the mother.
23167500	23170800	Wait, can I get them to deal with the enemies?
23170800	23173100	Oh, my God, that's so cool.
23173100	23175600	I can, like, go through here.
23175600	23179400	Is there, like, a treasure chest or something?
23179400	23182400	Or is this just, like, a hurry up?
23182400	23184800	Oh, wait, that symbol.
23184800	23186700	That means there's loot here?
23186700	23189200	I don't see no loot.
23189200	23193000	Or does it just mean that the thieves' guild was here?
23196200	23198100	Huh?
23198100	23200900	I'm so confused.
23200900	23203700	I feel like there may have been something I missed,
23203700	23205500	but hey-ho.
23207200	23208100	All right, let's get to it.
23208100	23209100	Everybody get to it.
23209100	23210100	To it.
23210100	23211100	Let's get this part.
23211100	23212100	It started.
23212100	23214500	Let's get the foam.
23214500	23216600	Departed.
23216600	23218000	Mercer was here.
23218000	23219800	Shield one-handed is perfectly viable.
23219800	23220600	Thank you very much.
23220600	23222900	Probably.
23222900	23223500	What do they hold?
23223500	23226700	So they just kind of hold a lot of, like, mix and stuff.
23226700	23227600	That's interesting.
23227600	23232000	I guess a few were more into, like, the alchemy side of things.
23232000	23233100	Oh, master a lot.
23233100	23235700	Right, I'm not bothering.
23235700	23236800	Saw his bot on your bike.
23236800	23238100	Mm-hmm.
23240500	23242100	Hydration check.
23248600	23249900	Oh.
23256500	23258000	Wow!
23267100	23268900	Such a ship.
23271900	23272800	Mm-hmm.
23272800	23275100	Yeah, give me the key, Mercer.
23279000	23283000	The water's rising.
23292000	23293500	Uh...
23295500	23296600	I don't believe you, no.
23296600	23298000	Turtle gates me.
23298000	23300000	My new friend leaking.
23309000	23311300	Both of us lie, cheat, and steal.
23311300	23312800	Oh!
23312800	23314000	Dun, dun, dun.
23314000	23318000	The difference is, I still have honor.
23330400	23334800	If anyone falls, it'll be you, Mercer.
23339000	23342000	Nightingale.
23344000	23349000	Uh, I can't remember if this is hard or not.
23349000	23351000	Oh, no, he got wallets.
23351000	23353000	Oh, he's got blood drain.
23355000	23357000	Oh, my God.
23360000	23361000	Oh, where is he?
23361000	23362000	I can just see the red doll.
23362000	23364000	I'm chasing the red doll.
23364000	23365000	I'm not even...
23365000	23366000	There he is!
23366000	23367000	I found him!
23368000	23369000	Hello!
23369000	23370000	Hello!
23370000	23372000	I got him.
23372000	23373000	He's got...
23373000	23374000	Whoa, he's got like...
23374000	23375000	Yeah, I'll take all that.
23375000	23377000	Shit, give me everything.
23377000	23380000	Oh, I'm carrying too much to be able to run.
23380000	23381000	Uh...
23381000	23383000	Oh, sorry, hold on.
23383000	23384000	Sorry, excuse me.
23384000	23387000	Just need to drop a few things that I don't need.
23387000	23389000	I don't need an embalming tool.
23389000	23391000	I can show you that much.
23391000	23394000	Uh, don't need random chunks of ore.
23394000	23395000	That's fine.
23396000	23397000	A wall?
23397000	23398000	It looks like a ship.
23398000	23400000	Is that a tap?
23401000	23404000	Yeah, don't need all these random miscellaneous things.
23404000	23405000	That's fine.
23405000	23408000	Ingredients that could probably eat all the little ones
23408000	23412000	and clear up some side space stuff, I guess?
23413000	23415000	Unknown, unknown.
23415000	23416000	Sorry, guys.
23416000	23418000	I know the cave is collapsing.
23418000	23420000	It's very important I have a little taste test
23420000	23421000	of all these ingredients.
23421000	23422000	I assure you.
23422000	23423000	Food?
23423000	23424000	Yeah, sure.
23424000	23426000	I'm just freaking loaded up.
23426000	23428000	Am I light yet?
23428000	23429000	No, I'm not light yet.
23429000	23430000	Holy crap.
23430000	23431000	Okay, uh, right.
23431000	23434000	What do we not need?
23434000	23436000	That does say 26, not gonna lie.
23436000	23439000	Oh, I forgot to...
23439000	23441000	That one's better.
23441000	23443000	I don't want to, like, drop it, though.
23443000	23447000	I feel like I can sell it for, like, decent money, honestly.
23447000	23449000	Um...
23449000	23452000	I guess we'll just drop that shit.
23452000	23455000	Orcishbowl, 11, playing...
23455000	23457000	These don't really give me much money.
23458000	23459000	Okay.
23459000	23460000	So don't panic.
23460000	23463000	I know the cave is literally...
23463000	23464000	Why is it...
23464000	23467000	Oh, I know the cave is, like, perishing
23467000	23469000	and it's falling with war.
23469000	23470000	But don't panic, guys.
23470000	23472000	Everything is okay, alright?
23472000	23474000	You just have to let it fill.
23474000	23475000	Oh.
23475000	23476000	Oh, he...
23476000	23478000	Oh, he hit the quad.
23478000	23479000	The quad.
23479000	23480000	Oh, are you guys okay?
23480000	23481000	Do you guys need to breathe?
23481000	23482000	No?
23482000	23483000	No, you don't need to breathe?
23483000	23484000	Okay.
23484000	23485000	You don't have to.
23485000	23490000	If you look above the head of the elf,
23490000	23496000	you'll notice those rocks look very suspiciously movable.
23496000	23497000	That's because they are.
23497000	23498000	You have a keen eye.
23498000	23500000	Refling, you have a keen eye.
23502000	23507000	Strongly to taste test all the new alchemy ingredients.
23507000	23509000	Literally, like, trying to, like, release.
23509000	23511000	Some of the weight in my inventory.
23511000	23513000	And I'm like, hmm, yes, hmm.
23513000	23515000	This moth wing is the whole...
23515000	23517000	What a delicacy.
23517000	23519000	You just have to wait.
23519000	23521000	Unfortunately, you can't, like, swim upwards.
23521000	23524000	It doesn't do it the way you want it to.
23524000	23526000	So it's a bit awkward.
23526000	23528000	But yeah.
23528000	23531000	I remember the first place where I was trying to, like,
23531000	23532000	swim through these pipes.
23532000	23536000	I was like, yes, the pipes, the pipes will save me.
23536000	23540000	But it should do one big collapse.
23540000	23542000	There you go.
23542000	23545000	Take it long enough, honestly.
23545000	23551000	And then you just gotta wait until it gets high enough to get up there.
23551000	23555000	To shift the weight in my body eats 50 cheese wheels.
23555000	23556000	We are aquatic.
23556000	23558000	Let me eat some too.
23558000	23561000	Stopping to release, yes, there.
23561000	23562000	Hmm.
23562000	23564000	But it's faster you get out of that cave
23564000	23566000	the easier the game.
23570000	23571000	Briff.
23571000	23572000	Briff.
23572000	23575000	I have completely forgotten how much the NPCs
23575000	23578000	love to talk to you.
23578000	23580000	Five, eight, nine.
23582000	23583000	No!
23583000	23585000	Carlisle!
23589000	23591000	It's not simple.
23595000	23596000	Sepucar.
23596000	23598000	I've never said sepucar.
23601000	23604000	Are you ready to take a pilgrimage together?
23614000	23617000	Then we'd best get started.
23624000	23626000	You need to protect the king.
23626000	23629000	I'm afraid you'll have to face the end of your journey alone.
23632000	23633000	Take this with you.
23633000	23636000	I'm not certain if it will help within the walls of the sepucar.
23636000	23638000	I've had this for the most time.
23639000	23641000	And I haven't let me down.
23641000	23643000	I hope it brings you the same path.
23654000	23656000	I'll literally yank the HP off him.
23657000	23660000	Can we serve Strony in other ways?
23660000	23661000	Absolutely.
23663000	23666000	It depends what your offering is to me.
23668000	23671000	Aw, I've not even been a folk wreath yet!
23674000	23676000	Actually, you know what?
23676000	23680000	I need to destroy and enchant a few things to sell on.
23680000	23683000	So I'm gonna go do that now and it will free up a lot of inventory.
23684000	23686000	Is Carlaya the same VA as Shadowheart?
23686000	23687000	I cannot tell you that.
23687000	23688000	I don't know.
23689000	23691000	Baldur's Gate is such a good review, though,
23691000	23694000	that I'm really tempted to play it for the first time on stream.
23695000	23698000	I'm worried in case I'm so dumb I can't figure it out,
23698000	23700000	but hopefully it's a full-proof game.
23700000	23702000	Anyone can just jump in on the fun.
23702000	23704000	This is what I want.
23705000	23708000	Devouring, archery, and potions.
23708000	23710000	Everything else can be sold.
23710000	23712000	You heard it here first.
23715000	23717000	Did I even have a big gem?
23718000	23719000	I do!
23720000	23721000	Yes!
23722000	23723000	Did I make it craft?
23723000	23724000	Yes!
23725000	23727000	That was bloody good shoo.
23727000	23729000	That bloody good shoo.
23729000	23730000	Right, where's that?
23730000	23731000	Okay.
23732000	23736000	So what? Just enchant random stuff now for the XP, I guess?
23737000	23738000	Turn Undead.
23738000	23740000	Frost Damage, here, why not?
23740000	23741000	Petty Soul Gem.
23741000	23744000	Yeah, I'm just going to put Petty Soul Gem stuff on it.
23747000	23751000	And then I know I can sell everything in my inventory.
23751000	23754000	God, look at the level up is so fast.
23755000	23757000	This game is so forgiving.
23762000	23763000	Just the noise.
23765000	23767000	It's just constantly like...
23768000	23771000	We'll put all of this stuff on.
23771000	23773000	And then we can get a pretty penny.
23773000	23775000	Oh, we might be able to buy the home.
23775000	23778000	We might be able to buy our home in Riften.
23779000	23783000	And then we can have our little flower garden out in front.
23784000	23786000	We can't get chickens though.
23786000	23787000	Not yet.
23787000	23790000	Baldur's Gate 3 is good and you can do whatever you want.
23790000	23792000	It's not really wrong way of playing it.
23792000	23794000	Baldur's Gate is really open and rewarding.
23794000	23795000	I'm glad.
23798000	23799000	Um...
23802000	23803000	I can't figure it out.
23803000	23806000	Also, it tells us, please backseat me.
23806000	23807000	You'll be fine.
23808000	23812000	Yeah, some folk really are so strongly like a little bit backseat gaming.
23812000	23816000	I'm actually going to travel to Riften just to sell some stuff
23816000	23818000	because my inventory is getting a bit too full.
23819000	23824000	Now, as much as I like being full and, you know, a bandaid slapped on top.
23824000	23825000	Not like this.
23825000	23826000	What is this?
23831000	23832000	You!
23834000	23838000	I would like to sell some weapons that are very heavy.
23841000	23842000	I will keep children.
23842000	23844000	I'll put it elsewhere.
23848000	23850000	I don't want to sell that stuff.
23850000	23853000	I'd rather keep it in the prowl.
23853000	23856000	I can sell, like, all of it right here at Money's.
23859000	23860000	I will remember that.
23863000	23865000	You can marry the butcher.
23865000	23866000	He's not butcher.
23866000	23868000	He's a blacksmith making all that.
23868000	23870000	Those wires are really crossed on me.
23870000	23871000	Please take...
23873000	23876000	Please take some of my stuff that I don't need.
23877000	23878000	Thanks. Appreciate it.
23879000	23882000	Created potions are 1% more per...
23882000	23886000	Wait, no, actually, I'm going to keep the diamonds and stuff on me.
23886000	23890000	The reason for that is because you can get, like,
23890000	23892000	Miscellaneous Quest to ask for that basic stuff.
23892000	23893000	How about you?
23896000	23898000	Everything I've got on display, really.
23899000	23900000	We're going to get rid of all this.
23900000	23902000	This should really lighten the load.
23904000	23906000	I don't want to sell that thing.
23906000	23909000	Oh, I completely forgot I had, like, all those...
23912000	23913000	That must...
23913000	23915000	Oh, he's not going to go left.
23915000	23916000	Oops.
23916000	23917000	Oops, I'm giving away things for free.
23917000	23918000	Oopsies.
23918000	23919000	Oopsies.
23919000	23920000	Teehee.
23920000	23921000	Little teehee moment.
23921000	23924000	Right, we'll go Falkreath and then we'll hit up Twilight's...
23924000	23925000	La-la-la-la-la.
23926000	23928000	Strangely, I will remember everything you said.
23928000	23929000	Bear, no.
23929000	23931000	I even don't want to say half the time.
23931000	23932000	I'm just here for a good time.
23932000	23935000	Do you remember when we almost got our head chopped off?
23935000	23938000	Yeah, and I was taken over by bandits and burnt to a crisp.
23938000	23939000	Teehee, not my problem.
23939000	23940000	Teehee.
23942000	23947000	Strangely, Ever dropped a bunch of jewelry in the shopping centre in Riften.
23947000	23950000	Everyone starts fighting over stuff you drop,
23950000	23953000	and, like, it literally terminates NPCs,
23953000	23954000	and it's, like, the proof.
23954000	23956000	I've need them for quests.
23956000	23960000	That's the one thing I could absolutely obliterate Skyrim for,
23960000	23964000	is if a quest requires an NPC,
23964000	23967000	do not let them be perishable.
23967000	23969000	Do not let them expire.
23969000	23971000	I am so sad.
23971000	23973000	What the heck is...
23973000	23976000	Oh, no!
23978000	23981000	The wolves jump these poor people,
23981000	23984000	and the one wolf perished them both.
23988000	23991000	That's what you get for trying to execute an innocent dragonborn.
23992000	23994000	Some of them are marchers.
23994000	23997000	Yeah, like, some NPCs can't be perishable,
23997000	23999000	but if they have a quest,
23999000	24001000	I feel like they shouldn't be able to expire at all,
24001000	24004000	because it's so annoying when you're, like, trying to do it,
24004000	24006000	and then it's, like, all surprised, by the way.
24006000	24007000	Oh, who are you?
24007000	24008000	Hello.
24013000	24015000	Mummy, Goo Goo Gaga Azura.
24016000	24017000	Mummy.
24017000	24019000	Any mummies.
24020000	24022000	We'll make it a little tea break.
24022000	24023000	A little tea break?
24023000	24024000	Is that allowed?
24024000	24026000	Is that permitted?
24028000	24032000	And then I'm going to get a wee snack as well.
24034000	24037000	A bit of a little cup of tea, a little bit of water.
24039000	24044000	Yeah, I'm starting to think we're getting, like, absolutely nothing done.
24044000	24047000	We're pretty much looking at T-minus two hours.
24047000	24049000	I've been live for almost seven hours.
24049000	24051000	I've yet to finish the quest.
24052000	24054000	Right, fault creases here.
24056000	24058000	What the heck is that?
24060000	24063000	Bro, you cannot drop rocks on people's heads.
24063000	24066000	I cannot tell you how inappropriate that is.
24069000	24072000	I am home with my mummy.
24072000	24075000	We drink milk and tea up in this place, of course.
24078000	24081000	Literally, how have I been at this for seven hours?
24081000	24082000	I'm not completed one quest.
24082000	24083000	Something's not adding up.
24083000	24084000	I don't know.
24084000	24089000	Like, I'm pretty sure the Skyrim World record is, like, two hours.
24089000	24092000	Like, one hour and 52 minutes or something.
24092000	24093000	Ridiculous like that.
24093000	24100000	And you're telling me in seven hours, near seven hours, I couldn't finish one quest line.
24102000	24103000	Well, I need sleep.
24103000	24104000	Good night.
24104000	24105000	Thank you for hanging.
24105000	24106000	No promises.
24106000	24107000	I won't see you in my dreams.
24107000	24108000	That's right.
24108000	24109000	Get Scottish.
24109000	24110000	Get Scottish.
24110000	24111000	Get Scottish.
24111000	24114000	Your only dream of a Scottish.
24114000	24116000	The Highland Cows call you.
24119000	24122000	Ooh, I don't want to walk over a grave.
24122000	24124000	That's bad luck.
24124000	24125000	There's a lot of graves.
24125000	24127000	What's going on in fault grief?
24127000	24131000	I feel like that's probably a quest, because that's a lot.
24131000	24134000	Scotland, forever.
24136000	24138000	A little tricky thing.
24138000	24139000	Get Scottish.
24139000	24140000	Get Scottish.
24140000	24141000	Get Scottish.
24141000	24142000	I think I need to do that.
24142000	24144000	Someone did that where it was like, get pregnant, get pregnant, get pregnant.
24144000	24146000	And it's like, do you didn't see it?
24146000	24147000	Like, really intense music.
24147000	24149000	I want to do that, but like, get Scottish.
24149000	24150000	Get Scottish.
24150000	24151000	Get Scottish.
24154000	24155000	We're almost there.
24155000	24156000	We're almost there.
24156000	24157000	We're almost there.
24157000	24160000	We're just going to run a little bit longer.
24161000	24165000	Oh, there's castles and ruins.
24165000	24169000	Did you know you can just straight up buy castles in Scotland?
24169000	24171000	Fun fact, you can literally look up them online.
24171000	24173000	Just type in Castle for sale in Scotland.
24173000	24176000	I'm not even kidding.
24176000	24179000	It's pretty intense and cool.
24179000	24181000	And you can buy churches.
24181000	24185000	It's a lot cheaper to live in a church, an ex-church, by the way.
24185000	24188000	You can literally, it's like churches for sale in Scotland.
24188000	24189000	Yeah.
24189000	24190000	Just have a look.
24190000	24191000	It's like way cheaper.
24194000	24198000	Shawnee, have you heard of the Scott Wikipedia vandalism story?
24198000	24199000	Yes.
24199000	24201000	Oh, we should talk about it.
24201000	24206000	Like, if you didn't know, so Scots is basically slang.
24206000	24209000	And we say things very phonetically.
24209000	24215000	And someone, whoa, I didn't realize you were a bandit.
24215000	24216000	Sorry.
24216000	24219000	Time to go, buddy.
24219000	24220000	Okay.
24220000	24226000	And someone basically went, oh, I'll just rewrite this in Scots.
24226000	24229000	But he, like, wasn't Scottish.
24229000	24233000	So he just wrote what he thought, like, Scottish folks said.
24233000	24235000	And it was just complete gibberish.
24235000	24239000	And he'd been doing it for ages and no one, like, caught him.
24239000	24241000	Wasn't that it?
24241000	24247000	He said in Zillow, Scotland to find an affordable hoose, honestly.
24247000	24249000	It's Gallus.
24249000	24250000	Hello.
24250000	24252000	Hello, Gallus.
24259000	24260000	I visited Edinburgh.
24260000	24261000	Let's go.
24261000	24264000	I'd ask the same question with you.
24264000	24266000	It's really funny.
24266000	24269000	Shawnee's going to buy a castle, move the wheel or team into it,
24269000	24271000	reference to serve them there.
24271000	24273000	But could you imagine, though?
24273000	24277000	Like, oh, you know what, you get out of this exchange?
24277000	24279000	I servited.
24282000	24285000	How are you to blame?
24291000	24293000	Where can I say not?
24296000	24298000	Wait a minute, you're Gallus.
24299000	24303000	I've heard that name in a long, long time.
24303000	24305000	How do you know of me?
24305000	24308000	I'm best pals with your girlfriend.
24308000	24309000	The key.
24309000	24311000	You have the skeleton key.
24311000	24314000	I never thought I'd see it again.
24314000	24316000	How do you say I love you in Scottish?
24316000	24319000	It's just I love you.
24319000	24324000	Like, I love you, and then I love you.
24324000	24327000	It's kind of, like, shoved together in fast.
24327000	24329000	He's that adoring fan.
24329000	24331000	Is he?
24331000	24333000	Biazura, Biazura, Biazura.
24333000	24334000	I did this for Nektoro.
24334000	24336000	I did this for the owner of the guild.
24342000	24344000	Carlaya helped me.
24346000	24348000	Yes, your girlfriend's alive.
24354000	24356000	Well, then she would have appeared here.
24356000	24358000	Then take the key and right all the wrongs.
24364000	24366000	When we put the strongens or cult leader,
24366000	24368000	we could cut taxes and save money.
24368000	24369000	Yay!
24371000	24373000	We can be tax exempt together.
24373000	24374000	Yippee!
24375000	24377000	How can I, how can a spirit die?
24377000	24379000	The sepulchre isn't nearly a temple
24379000	24381000	or a vault to house the key.
24381000	24385000	Within these walls is the ebony.
24385000	24386000	The ebony?
24386000	24388000	A bit of an ebony.
24390000	24392000	When Mercer stole the key,
24392000	24394000	that conduit closed,
24394000	24395000	severely limiting our...
24395000	24397000	Maintaining a historical site
24397000	24399000	for tax breaks and profit?
24399000	24400000	Yeah!
24400000	24402000	And then we run, like, a massive B&B over.
24402000	24403000	Oh, my God.
24403000	24404000	Oh!
24404000	24406000	I'm afraid so.
24406000	24407000	I'm weakening.
24407000	24410000	And I can feel myself slipping away.
24410000	24412000	The years without restoration of my power
24412000	24414000	I had taken their toll.
24414000	24416000	You really want to mess with the IRS?
24416000	24418000	That should be a song.
24418000	24420000	You really want to mess with the IRS?
24422000	24425000	I fought the law in the law one.
24426000	24427000	Ray.
24427000	24428000	I will go.
24429000	24430000	Good luck, Gallus.
24430000	24432000	Even if you don't have to do anything,
24432000	24433000	that's okay, I'll do it all.
24433000	24435000	I don't mind doing the hard work, right?
24435000	24436000	Who needs a bastion?
24437000	24438000	Who needs a bastion?
24438000	24439000	Who's begging for the pagan?
24439000	24441000	Because it's all happening at once.
24441000	24442000	Let's go!
24442000	24443000	I bet he do.
24443000	24445000	Beat him up, beat him up, beat him up!
24445000	24446000	Beat him up!
24446000	24447000	Ay! Ay! Ay!
24447000	24448000	Oh, wow.
24448000	24450000	They're actually kind of beef.
24450000	24452000	They're actually a bit stronger
24452000	24453000	than your average enemy.
24453000	24454000	Hold on a minute.
24454000	24455000	I don't like that.
24455000	24456000	Where's...
24456000	24457000	You, come here.
24457000	24458000	No.
24458000	24459000	I'm stuck on the stairs.
24459000	24460000	Hold on.
24461000	24462000	I'm stuck on...
24462000	24463000	Ow! Ow!
24463000	24464000	Stop!
24464000	24465000	Swap to weapon, Ray!
24465000	24466000	Stop to melee!
24466000	24467000	Yes, there you go.
24467000	24468000	Okay, there we go.
24469000	24470000	Jeez, I lose.
24471000	24472000	What is in you?
24473000	24474000	Arrows?
24475000	24476000	So, Gem!
24477000	24478000	Alchemy!
24480000	24482000	Totally not secret,
24482000	24483000	backtracking.
24484000	24485000	I do love Skyrim for that.
24485000	24486000	It's quite...
24486000	24487000	It's quite rather entertaining.
24488000	24489000	Okay, they've got elven arrows
24489000	24490000	on their persons,
24490000	24491000	which is pretty...
24491000	24492000	Ugh.
24495000	24497000	Whoa, why are you so scary?
24500000	24501000	I'm not gonna lie.
24501000	24503000	Like, they're kind of messing me up now.
24504000	24506000	Open our own velar colony?
24507000	24508000	What?
24508000	24510000	In the Scottish countryside with crops
24510000	24512000	and feudal lordship for the growth?
24513000	24514000	Bruh.
24516000	24517000	Look, sometimes a sense of community
24517000	24518000	is all you need.
24518000	24520000	Wait, I'm to stay in the dark.
24522000	24524000	Right, if you stay in the dark,
24524000	24525000	your health doesn't get...
24528000	24530000	Well, wasn't paying attention to that.
24530000	24531000	Was I?
24531000	24532000	Clearly, no?
24533000	24535000	Uh, yeah, you just need to stay in the dark
24535000	24536000	so you don't get hurt in this section.
24536000	24538000	It's not really too bad at all.
24538000	24540000	I just can't see nothing in it at all.
24541000	24542000	Oh!
24542000	24544000	It's just a wee bit of poison.
24544000	24545000	Just a few darts in my eyeballs.
24545000	24546000	It's fine, it's fine.
24546000	24548000	I can still see for the most part.
24548000	24549000	Hee hee.
24549000	24551000	I wish I wore my glasses.
24552000	24553000	Ah, we did it!
24553000	24554000	Hey!
24554000	24555000	Woo!
24555000	24556000	Let's go.
24556000	24557000	What's this?
24557000	24558000	Ah!
24558000	24560000	My lady!
24560000	24561000	Hello!
24563000	24564000	Oh!
24564000	24566000	A bandit got all the way here.
24567000	24568000	Hello, my lady.
24568000	24570000	Please ignore the fact that I'm taking your offering.
24570000	24572000	So fragmented, I don't need that.
24573000	24576000	Uh, uh, behind here is two chains to pull.
24577000	24578000	Gammy!
24580000	24581000	Atlas!
24582000	24583000	Where's Blossom?
24584000	24585000	Where's Gammy?
24585000	24587000	That's Gammy, the girl.
24587000	24589000	And that's her dad, Atlas.
24589000	24591000	And Blossom's her mummy.
24593000	24594000	Hmm.
24594000	24596000	Is it true if you buy Landon Scott, you become a lord?
24596000	24598000	No, that is completely false.
24598000	24602000	Um, if you take that in, by the way,
24602000	24603000	you'll actually...
24603000	24604000	What on earth?
24605000	24606000	Um...
24609000	24610000	Hello!
24611000	24612000	Ow!
24612000	24614000	Oh my god, I just got reeled by a log.
24614000	24616000	That wasn't really that fun, I'm gonna be honest.
24618000	24619000	Right, we did it.
24619000	24620000	We did it.
24620000	24621000	We're here, we're here.
24621000	24623000	Snowberry's waiting on Aces every need.
24623000	24625000	Penpal's being picked for a set of me.
24628000	24631000	Oh, it's all spooky, it's all spooky and purple.
24632000	24635000	Oh, I love the color scheme.
24637000	24639000	Oh, I remember this.
24642000	24644000	Oh no, I'm stuck.
24646000	24647000	I should read his note.
24648000	24650000	Anderson's, Andrew's message.
24650000	24652000	I can't believe it, I came all this way,
24652000	24654000	solved all of those ridiculous riddles,
24654000	24655000	just to end up here.
24655000	24658000	After I memorized Nystrom's clues,
24658000	24660000	he'd collected from Letheus,
24660000	24661000	isolate his throat.
24661000	24662000	Now I guess the joke's on me,
24662000	24664000	because I'm stuck here and I don't see a way out.
24664000	24666000	Hope someone comes by soon, I'm getting hungry.
24666000	24668000	I don't think he made it, chief.
24668000	24670000	I don't think he made it.
24670000	24671000	Yeah.
24674000	24676000	If only we had some sort of...
24677000	24678000	key?
24679000	24682000	Some sort of skeleton...
24682000	24683000	key?
24684000	24685000	Yep.
24688000	24689000	Oh.
24699000	24700000	Oh, I'm stuck.
24700000	24701000	What have we got?
24706000	24707000	Oh, yes.
24708000	24709000	Gammys!
24709000	24710000	Look at all Gammys babies!
24710000	24712000	Oh, I'm the wrong way, sorry Hen.
24718000	24720000	Tell me that ain't good design.
24722000	24724000	Excuse me, will Stylical around?
24726000	24727000	Oh, yeah.
24729000	24730000	Oh, yeah.
24737000	24738000	Oh, yeah.
24749000	24752000	Nothing more than the fulfillment of your agreement.
24754000	24756000	We must stay focused, Reeflings.
24756000	24758000	We must stay focused.
24779000	24784000	I wish you to drink deeply from the Evermere mortal.
24784000	24788000	Or this is where the agent of Nocturnal is born.
24789000	24790000	Drink?
24790000	24792000	The oath has been strong.
24792000	24794000	The die has been cast.
24794000	24797000	And your fate awaits you in the Everglow.
24800000	24802000	Bye-bye, Mommy!
24808000	24810000	What? Where did you come from?
24810000	24811000	Hello?
24812000	24813000	Sorry.
24813000	24814000	Oh, sorry.
24815000	24816000	Oh, sorry.
24816000	24817000	Can I talk to you now?
24820000	24821000	Yes.
24824000	24826000	Uh, please, she sounded indifferent.
24839000	24842000	I assure you that she'd been displeased with you.
24842000	24844000	We wouldn't be having this conversation.
24846000	24849000	What's this about becoming an agent and a Nocturnal?
24854000	24857000	The crescent moon represents the agent of shadow.
24857000	24860000	The crescent moon, I think, is what we want.
24860000	24863000	In the full moon, for the agent of strife.
24864000	24867000	This is Nocturnal's role in maintaining balance.
24868000	24872000	How is this goddess of stealth when it's clear?
24873000	24875000	With the clap of her cheeks,
24875000	24878000	we'd alarm the guards on a 500 meter radius.
24880000	24881000	It's unfamiliar.
24881000	24883000	Her hotness is so powerful.
24888000	24889000	And you?
24892000	24893000	Aww.
24893000	24894000	Aww.
24896000	24897000	The beginning of what?
24905000	24906000	Wow.
24911000	24913000	We're down good at what we do.
24915000	24916000	Uh, I think stealth.
24916000	24918000	Tell me where the crescent moon.
24918000	24920000	Is the most on moonlit nights.
24921000	24922000	Yeah, okay.
24922000	24924000	Well, you do the agent of...
24925000	24927000	Are you a crescent moon?
24927000	24928000	You're a full moon.
24929000	24930000	And you're a half moon.
24930000	24931000	Okay, crescent moon.
24933000	24934000	Okay, now what?
24935000	24937000	Oh no, Gallus is about to come.
24940000	24943000	Ooh, look, it's Gallus and Carnaia.
24944000	24945000	They're gonna kiss.
24949000	24951000	I was afraid she'd become like the others.
24952000	24955000	If it were not for the actions of this Nightingale,
24955000	24957000	she and his would have come true.
24958000	24960000	She would have lost all hope.
24964000	24966000	Nocturnal calls me to the Everglow.
24967000	24969000	My contract has been fulfilled.
24971000	24973000	Will I ever see you again?
24973000	24976000	When your debt to Nocturnal has been paid,
24977000	24979000	we'll embrace what's ahead.
24980000	24982000	How well, Gallus.
24983000	24984000	Eyes open.
24985000	24986000	Walk with the shadows.
24986000	24988000	I've been 25 years since you've seen each other,
24988000	24989000	and this is it.
24989000	24990000	This is what they muster.
24991000	24993000	Are you alright, Carla?
24993000	24994000	Maybe it's just not...
24994000	24995000	She doesn't understand.
24997000	24999000	Oh, he's going to disappear into the bowl of soup.
24999000	25000000	Oh, he's in the bowl of soup, lads.
25001000	25003000	Sorry, I'm sure it's really emotional.
25004000	25005000	What is it?
25005000	25007000	He appeared at Gallus' school in our bowl of soup.
25010000	25012000	The spirit becomes one with the Everglow.
25016000	25017000	Ah.
25017000	25018000	So he's gone.
25022000	25023000	Okay.
25026000	25028000	You drank the ghost soup, honestly.
25032000	25034000	They're a part of the darkness around us.
25035000	25037000	When we say, walk with the shadows,
25038000	25041000	we are asking those nightingales who have passed on to protect us,
25041000	25045000	to believe that they are literally what guides our uncanny luck,
25046000	25048000	by placing their hands in ours.
25049000	25051000	That's why the Evermere needed to be reopened.
25052000	25054000	Without it, there's no way Nocturnal was able to...
25055000	25057000	I'm getting it now.
25058000	25059000	How will I know if I'm needed here?
25059000	25061000	If this place is in danger ever again,
25062000	25063000	the shadows will call.
25063000	25064000	Okay.
25064000	25065000	Where should the need arise?
25065000	25068000	A portal connects the Sepulchre and Nightingale Hall.
25068000	25070000	Use it whenever you wish.
25071000	25072000	Okay.
25074000	25075000	Where will you be?
25075000	25078000	I've decided to make my home at Nightingale Hall.
25079000	25080000	Since it's your home as well.
25081000	25083000	I hope to see you and bring you out there.
25084000	25087000	Of course, I may visit some of Skyrim's cities too.
25087000	25089000	Quiet things from time to time.
25089000	25091000	Can't afford to get rusty now, can we?
25092000	25094000	Well, I'm...
25094000	25095000	I'm satisfied.
25096000	25097000	Yeah, yeah, bye-bye.
25097000	25098000	Okay, thank you.
25099000	25100000	Thank you, hubby-bee.
25100000	25102000	Is this your home now?
25103000	25104000	It is!
25104000	25106000	Okay, so she just hangs out here now.
25106000	25107000	Girl, that's a bit depressive.
25107000	25109000	But anyway, that's all for now.
25109000	25111000	As long as you're having a good time and all that.
25111000	25115000	Thanks for the experience of being in Nightingale.
25116000	25118000	Alright, have a good night and good luck.
25118000	25119000	Thank you!
25119000	25122000	For those of you who need to go rest, please do rest.
25122000	25124000	I am literally farting about...
25126000	25127000	Cause...
25128000	25131000	Mercy is going live in two hours.
25131000	25134000	I'm gonna redirect into her and then it means I can...
25135000	25136000	Do a little bit of...
25136000	25140000	A little bit of preparation for my monetization stream tomorrow.
25140000	25142000	I'll need to actually make the thumbnail.
25142000	25144000	And you get a picture of my frickin' feet for the thumbnail.
25144000	25145000	Omega at low.
25145000	25146000	And...
25147000	25149000	Oh no, what did I do now?
25151000	25152000	Well, we do...
25152000	25153000	Night...
25153000	25156000	Night mother, night mother, send your child unto me for...
25156000	25157000	Oh no, sweet mother.
25157000	25158000	I keep saying night mother.
25159000	25160000	Apparently...
25161000	25162000	It's sweet mother.
25163000	25166000	I could've sworn I turned that on.
25166000	25167000	Man, there we go.
25167000	25168000	Yeah.
25169000	25172000	Group brushing, T minus 90 minutes.
25172000	25173000	Yes.
25173000	25174000	Right.
25174000	25176000	I am going to make a cup of tea.
25176000	25178000	If we would all like to get something to hydrate.
25178000	25180000	Gotta go to Winterhold for that one.
25180000	25181000	Yes.
25181000	25183000	I'm gonna make a cup of tea.
25184000	25185000	And then...
25186000	25187000	We will...
25187000	25190000	See how far we can get on the dark, brotherhood.
25190000	25194000	There's absolutely no way in heck we are getting anywhere close to it.
25197000	25198000	But...
25198000	25200000	It doesn't mean we can't start it, okay?
25200000	25203000	Man, I'll arrive late for tomorrow's stream cause I'll be at work.
25204000	25206000	It's a very short stream tomorrow.
25206000	25209000	It's not Skyrim part two, just...
25210000	25214000	For those of you who may be lurking, there is not a Skyrim part two tomorrow
25214000	25216000	cause I've completely messed up the achievements
25216000	25219000	and the whole point was to do the achievements.
25220000	25225000	And for some reason they're not working even though I am on Xbox Game Pass.
25225000	25227000	But we do have plenty of time in the future.
25227000	25231000	I will definitely come back to Skyrim once I've fixed whatever's going on.
25231000	25235000	Cause honestly, I'm like, should've just played cameo.
25240000	25243000	Sorry, we need to break in here so we can go talk to this kid.
25244000	25248000	Sweet mother, sweet mother, send your child unto me for this soon.
25250000	25251000	Very tired.
25251000	25252000	Oh no.
25254000	25257000	Sweet mother, send your child unto me.
25261000	25263000	So you come in.
25268000	25269000	Munkah.
25269000	25270000	S.
25273000	25274000	Are you alright?
25282000	25283000	The body?
25283000	25284000	She came.
25284000	25286000	An assassin from a dark brotherhood.
25289000	25291000	Ah yes, the black sacrum.
25291000	25293000	A Wang of course.
25293000	25294000	So long.
25294000	25296000	So very long.
25296000	25298000	But now that you're here, you can accept my contract.
25299000	25300000	Your contract?
25301000	25303000	My mother, she...
25303000	25304000	She died.
25304000	25306000	I'm all alone now.
25307000	25311000	So they sent me to the terrible orphanage in Riften on her hall.
25311000	25314000	The headmistress is an evil cruel woman.
25314000	25316000	They call her Grelad the kind.
25316000	25317000	But she's not kind.
25317000	25319000	She's terrible to all of us.
25320000	25323000	So I ran away and came home.
25323000	25325000	And performed the black sacrament.
25325000	25326000	Now we're here.
25326000	25328000	And you can kill Grelad the kind.
25331000	25333000	Sure, buddy.
25336000	25338000	A kiss by the sweet mother.
25338000	25339000	What does the book say?
25339000	25340000	Hand that book over.
25341000	25343000	So you wish to summon the dark brotherhood.
25343000	25345000	You wish to see someone dead.
25345000	25349000	Pray, child, pray, and let the night mother hear your plea.
25349000	25354000	You must perform that most profane of rituals, the black sacrament.
25354000	25360000	Create an effigy of the intended victim assembled from actual body parts,
25360000	25363000	including a heart, skull, bones, and flesh.
25363000	25365000	And circle that effigy with candles.
25365000	25368000	The ritual itself must then commence.
25369000	25372000	Proceed to stab the effigy repeatedly with a dagger,
25372000	25377000	rubbed with the petals of a nightshade plant while whispering this plea.
25377000	25380000	Sweet mother, sweet mother, send your child unto me
25380000	25383000	for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear.
25383000	25389000	Then wait, child, for the dread father sitheth rewards the patient.
25389000	25394000	You will be visited by a representative of the dark brotherhood.
25394000	25397000	So begins a contract bound in blood.
25397000	25399000	That's actually really cool.
25399000	25401000	Oh, I'm quite happy with that.
25401000	25404000	I quite like that kind of back behind the scenes,
25404000	25406000	not behind the scenes because it's like hidden in a book,
25406000	25408000	so it's not behind the scenes.
25408000	25413000	But I like seeing how the game like tried to explain it.
25413000	25414000	It's quite thingy.
25414000	25416000	Where did he find the body part?
25416000	25418000	Oh, he tried his best, okay.
25418000	25421000	Probably went into the crypt or something like that.
25421000	25424000	So this is probably the only instance
25424000	25428000	when you can perish someone in front of a whole group of people.
25430000	25431000	Sorry, Hen.
25435000	25438000	Yeah, you do not get in trouble for doing that.
25438000	25439000	And all the kids...
25442000	25445000	And they're all like laughing at our own stuff.
25446000	25447000	Wait, oh, I've gone the wrong way.
25447000	25449000	Sorry, I've gone the wrong way.
25451000	25452000	We're saved.
25454000	25457000	Yeah, literally one of the only instances
25457000	25459000	you can walk in and perish someone
25459000	25461000	and then come straight back out again.
25461000	25463000	They don't care.
25463000	25464000	No one cares.
25464000	25465000	The Rift and Guards don't even care.
25465000	25467000	They must have known as well.
25467000	25469000	Now, the actual nice lady takes over.
25469000	25470000	Yay!
25471000	25474000	So really, we just did everyone a big ol' favour.
25477000	25479000	I was like finding different fun ways.
25479000	25482000	Apparently you can cast Friendsly in the Children Parish Gray look.
25482000	25484000	I'm not sure if that's true or not.
25486000	25487000	Is she...
25487000	25488000	You know?
25488000	25490000	Like, kinda sounds like Midoriya.
25503000	25505000	What did you give me?
25505000	25506000	You're a child.
25506000	25508000	Completed Innocence Loss.
25509000	25511000	Family heirloom?
25511000	25513000	Oh, sorry, sorry.
25513000	25514000	My bad.
25514000	25515000	I got a little...
25515000	25518000	I just needed to check what your family heirloom was.
25520000	25521000	Is there any?
25521000	25522000	Oh, there is.
25523000	25524000	A plate?
25524000	25525000	A plate.
25525000	25528000	I mean, you are a child, so I guess that makes sense.
25529000	25531000	Now, if I remember correctly,
25531000	25533000	we need to go sleep in a bed.
25534000	25537000	The first sleep the poor dragonborn has had
25537000	25539000	since I started my adventures,
25539000	25541000	so we'll just rent a little bed in here.
25543000	25546000	You ever just accidentally dash across the house, honestly?
25548000	25549000	Oh, you.
25549000	25550000	Hello!
25550000	25551000	Hello!
25551000	25553000	Can you come a bit closer?
25553000	25554000	Okay, I guess not.
25555000	25556000	Yeah, I'd like to rent a room.
25558000	25559000	Thanks, darling.
25560000	25561000	Oh, okay.
25561000	25562000	Oh, 10...
25562000	25563000	10 stars!
25563000	25564000	Whoa!
25566000	25567000	Hello?
25567000	25568000	My lady?
25568000	25569000	You want to join me?
25576000	25577000	Okay.
25579000	25581000	Right, please stop talking to me.
25581000	25582000	I'm trying to be sure in my room,
25582000	25583000	but I'm having to help the NPC.
25583000	25584000	Okay, there we go.
25584000	25586000	Thank you for showing me my room.
25587000	25588000	If you want the tip,
25588000	25589000	just stay in the room, right?
25589000	25590000	Get in that bed.
25590000	25591000	Don't be ill.
25591000	25592000	It's all right.
25593000	25594000	Absolutely shocking behavior.
25594000	25595000	Please stop.
25595000	25596000	12 hours.
25596000	25598000	We won't make a cup of tea very shortly.
25598000	25599000	I'm sorry.
25599000	25600000	I'm sorry.
25600000	25601000	I'm getting delirious.
25601000	25602000	Miss Johnny,
25602000	25604000	can I be excused from the history of the Nordic class
25604000	25605000	to use the bathroom?
25605000	25607000	Yes, you're allowed to use the toilet.
25607000	25611000	Right, I am going to go make a cup of tea.
25615000	25616000	What?
25616000	25618000	Was that not supposed to be kidnapped?
25618000	25620000	After you perish?
25622000	25624000	Does it have to be about the island?
25628000	25629000	Huh.
25632000	25634000	Give her to her, kid.
25634000	25636000	It's after you receive a courier's lair.
25636000	25637000	Ah!
25637000	25638000	How are you streaming now?
25638000	25640000	How are you so powerful?
25640000	25641000	I'm not sure.
25641000	25642000	I don't know.
25642000	25643000	I don't know.
25643000	25644000	I don't know.
25644000	25645000	I don't know.
25645000	25646000	I don't know.
25646000	25647000	What are you streaming now?
25647000	25648000	How are you so powerful?
25648000	25651000	That is called autism.
25651000	25653000	And I love my games.
25653000	25655000	Right, I'm waiting on the courier.
25655000	25657000	Courier, courier.
25657000	25659000	Courier, courier.
25659000	25660000	Give me a letter.
25660000	25662000	Courier, my boss.
25662000	25663000	Right, ah, sorry.
25663000	25665000	I'm going to go get a cup of tea to recalibrate
25665000	25668000	because I have been playing for a hot second.
25668000	25670000	I'm going to have to pause the game sadly
25670000	25672000	because there can be NPC events
25672000	25674000	such as cultists entering the town
25674000	25676000	which can kill NPCs.
25676000	25677000	So I will have it paused
25677000	25679000	whilst I go quickly make a cup of tea.
25679000	25684000	Please do stretch your legs
25684000	25686000	and get yourself a wee water
25686000	25689000	and have a pee.
25689000	25691000	You've got to sleep.
25691000	25692000	No.
25692000	25694000	All right, sorry, man.
25694000	25696000	Yeah, I thought you had to sleep right away
25696000	25698000	but I need to receive the letter
25698000	25699000	with a hand that says we know
25699000	25702000	and then go to sleep, okay?
25702000	25704000	So go for a tinkle.
25704000	25705000	Go get some water.
25705000	25707000	I'm going to get a cup of tea
25707000	25708000	and we're going to recalibrate
25708000	25710000	and come back and meet in the middle.
25710000	25712000	It will be a couple of minutes, okay?
25712000	25715000	I think I can get a wee snack.
25715000	25718000	Right, I'll be right back.
25762000	25764000	Good night.
25792000	25795000	Good night.
25822000	25825000	Good night.
25852000	25855000	Good night.
25882000	25884000	Good night.
25912000	25915000	Good night.
25942000	25944000	Good night.
25972000	25974000	Good night.
26002000	26005000	Good night.
26032000	26034000	Good night.
26062000	26064000	Good night.
26092000	26105000	Welcome to Europe.
26105000	26107000	Oh, wait, I said that wrong.
26107000	26110000	Welcome to Europe, young man.
26110000	26115000	Remember that 10-year-old vision?
26115000	26118000	Remember that 10-year-old vision?
26118000	26120000	Oh.
26120000	26123000	Sorry, that was the worst Dutch I think I've ever done so far.
26123000	26125000	I do apologize to any...
26125000	26128000	...Nederland-Mensen who are listening in.
26128000	26130000	But everyone else is just like,
26130000	26132000	what on earth are you even on about?
26132000	26134000	Hi.
26134000	26136000	Welcome back.
26136000	26138000	What, you thought I was gone forever?
26138000	26140000	I've got me a cup of tea,
26140000	26142000	and I've actually got strupewafel.
26142000	26143000	I'm not even kidding.
26143000	26145000	I have actual strupewafel.
26145000	26148000	I was supposed to eat it on the rating stream,
26148000	26153000	but I couldn't find any more European snacks.
26153000	26158000	So I'm just literally going to eat a little strupewafel.
26158000	26161000	Welcome back.
26161000	26162000	I love...
26162000	26164000	Strupewafel is like crack cocaine.
26164000	26166000	Sorry, but it's not.
26166000	26168000	Strupewafel is like crack cocaine.
26168000	26170000	Sorry, but it's so good.
26170000	26172000	Um...
26172000	26176000	Yes, mercy for the snippets who are lurking.
26176000	26179000	I appreciate you, even if I'm not your flavor.
26179000	26180000	Um...
26180000	26186000	Tea minus one hour and 40 minutes until your...
26186000	26191000	Kohai is ready to say hi-hi.
26191000	26193000	And prove that she can't whistle.
26193000	26195000	Which is adorable.
26195000	26198000	I can't believe I hired her on the basis she can't whistle.
26198000	26199000	Stop leaving a...
26199000	26202000	What? I'm not allowed to go get a cup of tea?
26202000	26204000	For my boys?
26204000	26205000	What do you mean?
26205000	26207000	You like hearing my words?
26207000	26208000	Like all cranky?
26208000	26209000	Yeah.
26209000	26211000	Are you ending when mercy comes on?
26211000	26214000	Yes, I'm going to redirect into her on purpose
26214000	26219000	because I didn't know I was getting monetization today.
26219000	26222000	So tomorrow we're doing the monetization celebration.
26222000	26225000	So I need to set up like all the emotes
26225000	26228000	and I need to set up on the price.
26228000	26232000	And I think very sadly I have to freaking charge more than 4.99
26232000	26239000	and I really don't want to charge more than 4.99 US dollars.
26239000	26244000	But I think I might have to because of this YouTube gifting stuff.
26244000	26249000	Can any of yous confirm that YouTube gifting thing is a nightmare or a hassle?
26249000	26251000	I'm going to take a bite of my waffle.
26261000	26264000	I know it's only like 2 cents difference.
26264000	26266000	I just don't like that.
26266000	26267000	Hold on.
26267000	26273000	I'm going to check out marshmallows.
26273000	26275000	If you'd like to send me any marshmallows,
26275000	26280000	I'm just going to take a quick pause champ on top of everything.
26280000	26281000	Jesus Christ.
26281000	26283000	Why do I have so many DMs?
26286000	26287000	Okay.
26287000	26288000	I don't know.
26289000	26290000	Oh good.
26290000	26291000	For the most part.
26292000	26294000	Oh, and now I can't see my mouse again.
26296000	26297000	Okay, marshmallow refresh.
26297000	26298000	Let's go.
26299000	26308000	A lot of follow girls have 1.99 tier and then 4.99 and the gift goes to the 4.99.
26312000	26314000	Would exactly 5 dollars work?
26314000	26315000	I possibly.
26326000	26327000	Hello mummy.
26327000	26330000	You're asking what software baby uses for 3D.
26330000	26334000	It's called Warudo for full body tracking.
26334000	26336000	There's a lot of videos about it.
26336000	26339000	But I think most YouTubers use Sony MoCopy,
26339000	26343000	SlimeVR or Vine trackers.
26343000	26344000	Okay, okay.
26347000	26348000	It's okay mummy.
26348000	26350000	I know you can't open my last Mario link on stream.
26350000	26353000	Don't forget to check later.
26353000	26355000	Is it bad that I check?
26355000	26357000	Like as soon as I go offline,
26357000	26360000	I just spend like another 30 minutes and I'm like, yeah.
26366000	26367000	What's the problem with gifting?
26367000	26372000	So the issue is if someone is very kind to gift,
26372000	26375000	but they can't dictate what type of tier to give,
26375000	26380000	it means outsiders isn't a nice term to use.
26380000	26381000	That's not the correct term.
26381000	26385000	But someone who maybe...
26387000	26388000	What's the word?
26388000	26390000	I'm trying to think.
26391000	26397000	Someone who gets access to membership streams
26397000	26399000	that should name.
26399000	26404000	You know, like someone who's just going to be rude about it
26404000	26405000	or whatever.
26406000	26407000	I don't know.
26408000	26411000	Yeah, use whatever.
26411000	26415000	It's better to have people watching the membership streams
26415000	26417000	that are actually interested
26417000	26420000	because someone might get a message
26420000	26423000	and it's like, oh right, okay.
26429000	26432000	You might be able to turn on gifting entirely.
26432000	26434000	Well, the problem is gifting is a massive money source
26434000	26435000	for the girls.
26438000	26443000	If someone's going to be a shitter in members' content,
26443000	26445000	they better be paying out their own pocket.
26445000	26447000	Ah, that's so funny.
26447000	26449000	I'm sorry, but that's actually such a funny statement.
26451000	26453000	Okay, Strani and fellow reeflings.
26453000	26458000	I'm going to have a fun rest of the stream.
26458000	26459000	Oh, now I need to go.
26459000	26461000	Sorry, fucking words are blending together.
26461000	26463000	I'll see you tomorrow.
26463000	26466000	Yes, I think it'll be roughly two hours.
26467000	26469000	It's a short stream tomorrow, do apologize,
26469000	26471000	but I'm needing overall vocal rest.
26471000	26474000	I've got quite a few VTuber ASMR collabs coming up,
26474000	26478000	so I'm needing to be a good girl and rest and try my best.
26481000	26484000	I am a Spanish reefling and I've been very...
26485000	26486000	No, you've not.
26488000	26489000	Hold on.
26490000	26492000	You've helped me pass some hard times,
26492000	26495000	so I just want to know that if you're really proud of you
26495000	26497000	your streams go...
26497000	26502000	Also, I like how you act on stream about gapping
26502000	26504000	and ranking burps is fun.
26504000	26506000	Se te quiera.
26506000	26513000	What is se te quiera in español in English for me,
26513000	26516000	because I don't know what se te quiera means.
26517000	26518000	I think it means.
26520000	26521000	I don't even know.
26525000	26527000	You are truly an anomaly.
26527000	26531000	I've never seen someone who is so intensely thoughtful
26531000	26535000	in caring about both your daughters and reefillings.
26535000	26537000	Yeah, also shameless.
26537000	26538000	Hold on.
26538000	26539000	What am I getting?
26539000	26541000	What am I getting spanked by?
26542000	26544000	It's a level of authenticity.
26544000	26546000	I would never...
26546000	26549000	I would never even see in a person,
26549000	26550000	let alone a VTuber.
26550000	26552000	I wish you all the success in the world.
26552000	26553000	Wow.
26553000	26555000	You did an absolutely fantastic job
26555000	26557000	on the tryharding in the ASMR stream.
26557000	26559000	I can only assume you have a really good coach
26559000	26562000	since it took me over a year to study to get to that level.
26563000	26564000	A coach?
26564000	26566000	Like a hypno coach?
26566000	26567000	No.
26567000	26569000	That's just called autism.
26569000	26571000	In general interest.
26571000	26574000	I just apply what I like to whatever
26574000	26576000	and I do it my way.
26576000	26578000	Also, it's something I would never do otherwise,
26578000	26579000	but my...
26580000	26583000	But my girlfriend has convinced me
26583000	26584000	I should do...
26584000	26585000	Bibbius?
26585000	26587000	So I've printed out 21 pages
26587000	26590000	so I can build some additional cognitive habits.
26590000	26592000	I made a collage by the end of the month.
26593000	26594000	What?
26594000	26596000	What is this?
26603000	26604000	What?
26604000	26605000	Well...
26606000	26607000	What is this?
26608000	26611000	What are these additional cognitive habits?
26612000	26613000	What is this?
26616000	26617000	21 Bibbius?
26617000	26618000	For me?
26618000	26619000	For me?
26619000	26620000	You have that in you?
26620000	26621000	Right now?
26623000	26624000	It's almost 5 am.
26624000	26625000	Yes, please rest well.
26625000	26628000	For those of you who are hanging on by a thread,
26628000	26632000	we're just going to start off the Dark Brotherhood
26632000	26633000	at this point.
26633000	26635000	I'm going to see if I can fix achievements
26635000	26637000	and possibly we can come back to Skyrim,
26637000	26639000	but tomorrow is being steamrolled
26639000	26641000	by monetization celebration stream.
26643000	26646000	Gotta get those micro plastics out of you somehow, honestly.
26651000	26654000	Hey Lassie, would you kindly raise the model up
26654000	26656000	so you can see more of the girlies?
26656000	26657000	You could zoom out a bit too
26657000	26659000	if you don't want to block too much of the game.
26660000	26662000	Someone said they don't like it.
26663000	26664000	Where is it?
26665000	26667000	I would have to go like this.
26671000	26672000	Does this work?
26672000	26673000	Hold on.
26674000	26675000	Does that work?
26676000	26677000	It does work.
26681000	26682000	That's terrible.
26685000	26687000	I can't really get away with it too much.
26688000	26689000	Let's behave.
26689000	26694000	A tomato a day keeps the other boys okay.
26694000	26697000	Yes, that is our new slogan, ladies and gentlemen.
26698000	26701000	Tomato a day keeps the other boy else okay.
26702000	26704000	I'm still trying to eat the same strip waffle.
26704000	26705000	I'm getting so distracted.
26706000	26708000	So when's the audio of you rambling about assassin's greed
26708000	26710000	or something while getting your...
26713000	26715000	Oh my god, you guys are getting our while.
26716000	26718000	I'm actually doing a review.
26719000	26724000	On Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
26724000	26726000	which should come out around November.
26726000	26728000	Like I'm doing an actual game review footage.
26728000	26730000	Like I'm being so serious on it.
26730000	26733000	So if you like hearing my accent putting you to sleep
26733000	26735000	well I can tell you about Assassin's Creed
26735000	26736000	and how amazing it is.
26739000	26741000	Sometimes I wish we could see the film.
26741000	26743000	They're pretty outrageous.
26743000	26746000	I'm trying my best to like dart around them.
26746000	26748000	But good night rest well those who need to rest.
26749000	26751000	I love Strauner's The Cuttlefish in this hoose.
26755000	26759000	Strauny, if you like V&N games, kind of reckon Valhalla is such a good game
26759000	26760000	and I think you'll like it.
26760000	26762000	I most certainly will check that out.
26762000	26764000	I may have in another life thought I was about to play it
26764000	26766000	and then play the complete wrong game
26766000	26768000	which was called Helltaker I believe.
26768000	26769000	And it was also a puzzle game
26769000	26772000	and I was so confused on why the game looked so different
26772000	26774000	to what I was playing
26774000	26776000	and it turns out I was playing the completely wrong game.
26776000	26779000	But yes, I would love to give Valhalla a try.
26781000	26784000	Hi cuttles, are Mondays and Tuesdays always going to be endurance?
26787000	26789000	No, they are not.
26789000	26793000	It's just a Quinky Dink really that I put on Monday and Tuesday.
26793000	26796000	But no, they're not always going to be the endurance on those days.
26798000	26799000	Yes.
26806000	26807000	Having you laugh about to...
26807000	26808000	Are you squiddin' me right now?
26808000	26809000	By the Pope!
26822000	26823000	I'm going to be so honest.
26823000	26826000	Brian did not help with my confusion
26826000	26829000	on the pronunciation of your name, tiny spainy.
26830000	26831000	What?
26831000	26833000	And you had it right.
26833000	26837000	As spainy is pronounced like a spainy anteater.
26837000	26843000	A spainy anteater or a spiny anteater.
26844000	26846000	Brian just made that ten times worse
26846000	26849000	and I do apologize if I'm now officially butchering it
26849000	26850000	but thank you for the tip.
26851000	26853000	Do it phonetically in chat.
26854000	26857000	Right, so it's either spainy
26857000	26861000	or did I even spainy?
26861000	26862000	So, you know.
26865000	26866000	Spainy.
26866000	26867000	Okay.
26867000	26868000	Spainy.
26869000	26870000	We got there in the end.
26870000	26875000	Literally, I'm renaming everyone who just doesn't have an easy to rename for me.
26878000	26879000	Spiny.
26879000	26884000	There are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday endurance streams.
26884000	26885000	Yes.
26886000	26887000	Mostly the stream stipend.
26887000	26890000	I'll try and do for like a big amount of time
26890000	26892000	because I know not everyone's available
26892000	26895000	at the one time zone, if you will.
26902000	26904000	Having you up about developmental psychology
26904000	26910000	and socially inculcated reactions to stress
26910000	26912000	made me realize I really wish that physical touch and affection
26912000	26913000	was more normalised in society.
26913000	26915000	Especially for men, male socialised people.
26915000	26916000	People need more hugs these days.
26916000	26918000	Also, I'm curious how you deal with the stress
26918000	26921000	and she mentioned you don't know how we do it.
26924000	26928000	I always have a goal or something to work towards
26928000	26931000	which helps distract me from what I'm feeling in the moment
26931000	26935000	and essentially makes me numb and work through it
26935000	26939000	so right now my goal is to help the girls achieve what they want.
26940000	26943000	So I'm like, even though I'm stressed
26943000	26946000	and I'm worried and I'm this and I'm that
26946000	26951000	because they are a much more important focus on my life
26951000	26955000	it's kind of one of those things where I can just put it to the side for now
26955000	26958000	and right, okay, what's next?
26958000	26961000	Once I get offline, I have some lovely VTubers
26961000	26963000	who are waiting on an ASMR collab from me.
26963000	26966000	I have to send away shorts for the girls.
26966000	26968000	I need to record that for them.
26969000	26971000	I need to do...
26978000	26980000	Every word is hard to pronounce.
26980000	26984000	If you're bad enough, for example, I pronounce spatula, spatula.
26984000	26990000	Honestly, I think having a purpose is really useful in general.
26990000	26993000	Yes, I agree with that, I also do it that way.
26993000	26997000	It's so tough to tackle men's socialisation
26997000	27001000	because where does it start?
27001000	27005000	It starts in the home, but then where does it get affected?
27005000	27007000	Secondary socialisation at school.
27007000	27011000	I don't know if you guys had this, but in Scotland
27014000	27018000	it became so quickly, oh that's gay, to show any affection
27018000	27023000	in any sense, in a basic hug, a basic handshake
27023000	27026000	rubbing shoulders against each other.
27026000	27030000	If you're both gay, you get, you get, and it starts from there
27030000	27034000	and then that isolation progresses further and further
27034000	27038000	to the point where the most natural thing,
27038000	27042000	which is a reassuring hug or embrace when you meet someone you know
27042000	27049000	becomes this almost taboo, unfamiliar territory.
27049000	27053000	And it is such a shame that you even have to experience that
27053000	27057000	because of the secondary socialisation, because your primary socialisation
27057000	27061000	which is your family, you know about your dad came home
27061000	27065000	and you gave him a big hug, like oh dad, and when you went and visited
27065000	27068000	your grandparents, oh granddad, grand, and gave him a wee kiss
27068000	27072000	and a wee hug and all that, and it all goes out the window
27072000	27076000	because of secondary socialisation.
27076000	27080000	Yet behind closed doors, behind closed doors, behind families
27080000	27084000	perfectly normal, absolutely normal behaviour
27084000	27090000	and it's very frustrating because to even think of how to tackle it
27090000	27093000	where do you even start?
27093000	27098000	Because the way it's set up is it's your fault
27098000	27102000	on an individual level that you can't do these things
27102000	27106000	that you can't hug your bro that you meet up with once a month
27106000	27110000	and you can, it's your fault because
27110000	27114000	you didn't keep up with that societal norm, you didn't break the moat
27114000	27119000	you, like see how it's so hard to break from society's grasp at that point?
27119000	27124000	Someone says how's the game going? I'm so sorry, I'm currently in a rant about
27124000	27130000	the social education that you get after, I'm freaking going on a rant again
27130000	27134000	I can't stop, I can't stop myself, it's fascinating stuff
27134000	27138000	when you start to really break it down, it becomes almost
27138000	27142000	frustrating when you realise how bare bones and simplistic humans
27142000	27146000	are in nature and yet we are, pardon me, sorry, I'm burping away
27146000	27149000	we are our own biggest enemies
27149000	27154000	we live in a society, literally, I'm typing that too
27154000	27159000	we live in a society
27159000	27163000	that's it, I'm typing that in chat, that's me getting it out there
27163000	27167000	we live in a society, get that out, get that off your chest
27167000	27171000	you're welcome to type we live in a society as well in chat to get it off your chest
27171000	27175000	because we do live in a society
27175000	27179000	we live in a society, therapy stream when?
27179000	27183000	oh I'm not sure I can do that, Mercy's actually doing
27183000	27187000	a terrible therapy advice stream
27187000	27191000	we live in a society
27191000	27195000	wait, yes
27195000	27199000	wait, yes, that, sorry, I just read that
27199000	27203000	refling that was like your toes did everything for me, you're welcome
27203000	27207000	after this stream
27207000	27211000	tonight, with all the conspiracy talk, I need you to do
27211000	27215000	conspiracy theory talking stream with Pippa, it would be incredible, love your yapping
27215000	27219000	I just can't wait to get enough of the adorable cut of it, oh I don't know if I would go too far
27219000	27223000	I've not had a chance to watch Pippa's content in a very long time
27223000	27227000	but I don't know if I would go too far and I'm like
27227000	27231000	I, my ideas are quite
27231000	27235000	alienating, like as much as we were meming on needy streamer overload
27235000	27239000	my
27239000	27243000	I know you're not really supposed to talk about any of that, you're supposed to be a tee hee
27243000	27247000	but yeah, I'm thinking you never know
27247000	27251000	I plan on writing a fairly long fantasy of mine
27251000	27255000	I've had of you, it's still cringe, I want to write it though as it was extremely
27255000	27259000	pent up after you did it, is pace been fine for this
27259000	27263000	yes, I recommend it
27263000	27267000	oh no, strong is a moon truth, oh god what's that, I don't even know what that is
27267000	27271000	I don't know if I'd go too far, she says when talking about the yabba
27271000	27275000	it would be a race to see who will go too far, you're a Pippa
27275000	27279000	I'm like, I'm probably
27279000	27283000	1984 dystopian type
27283000	27287000	allegations, I don't know what
27287000	27291000	Pippa's field is in particular
27291000	27295000	but I am dystopian based, whatever horrors of man made comprehension you
27295000	27299000	can think of, have occurred, you know, I'm like that
27299000	27303000	kind of side of things, can you please say in the thickest
27303000	27307000	Thailand accent
27307000	27311000	I cast tongue positional
27311000	27315000	awareness, sorry that was a really rough accent but there you go
27315000	27319000	what's your favourite, Pringles favour
27319000	27323000	paprika, I love Pappangles, Pippa is there
27323000	27327000	and lizards are in government, literally 1984, Shawnee Calls
27327000	27331000	Pippa is just
27331000	27335000	psycho, she'll go way too far quicker
27335000	27339000	well we shouldn't egg her on, how about we just leave this as
27339000	27343000	moon truth or believes the moon is a hologram
27343000	27347000	is a conspiracy theory made up to clown on
27347000	27351000	that people actually started, well
27351000	27355000	I have terrible news, I'm afraid I don't meet much of the requirements of a conspiracy
27355000	27359000	theory, I'm afraid that yes, our planet is in fact
27359000	27363000	very controversial, I know
27363000	27367000	it's okay, it's okay, you can unsubscribe
27367000	27371000	at least it's not Fahrenheit 451 yet
27371000	27375000	right?
27375000	27379000	yeah, Fahrenheit 451
27379000	27383000	yeah
27383000	27387000	I guess if the reason why
27387000	27391000	a lot of media before
27391000	27395000	a certain year was kind of scrubbed on a mass level, so people realise
27395000	27399000	people don't know that in every 100 years
27399000	27403000	I try to get a sense of that
27403000	27411000	true, Iron Reaver true
27411000	27415000	right, imagine burning books
27415000	27419000	you're a round airther unsubbed, I can't believe it
27419000	27423000	the moon round, the sun round
27423000	27427000	the earth on a turtle's back and world of warcraft
27427000	27431000	that's all I'm saying
27431000	27435000	the earth is round, oh wait isn't it not like a, there's like a certain name
27435000	27439000	because it's like a wonky round and not a perfect round
27439000	27443000	something like that
27443000	27447000	have I shared any bibboots?
27447000	27451000	I actually don't share them with the girls
27451000	27455000	just because
27455000	27459000	I don't know I just, it's never really occurred to me to do such a thing
27459000	27463000	an oval lumpy ball, yeah a lumpy ball
27463000	27467000	remember to check your balls regularly
27467000	27471000	find a lump, get it checked out ladies and gentlemen
27471000	27475000	and before you go, it's embarrassing
27475000	27479000	I assure you the person who is doing the ultrasound on your boss act
27479000	27483000	has already looked at about 10 sacks that day already
27483000	27487000	and within that week has probably seen over 100
27487000	27491000	I assure you your wristicles raggy are not that unique
27491000	27495000	get yourself checked out if you are worried
27495000	27499000	an ultrasound, yeah that's what they do against your
27499000	27503000	if you have a bump you get an ultrasound on your
27503000	27507000	wristicle, raggy
27507000	27511000	that's not the thing, isn't that an ultrasound? I checked I'm clear
27511000	27515000	I mean we could check live if you want
27515000	27519000	wow I zoomed through the backlog at 2x speed after hearing
27519000	27523000	back where you read my marrow
27523000	27527000	I found a lump and they have no idea what it is
27527000	27531000	some things can be completely benign
27531000	27535000	like you know we all come out a bit wonky
27535000	27539000	can you come out 100% a perfect specimen now
27539000	27543000	it's definitely thing had me balls all just sounded clear
27543000	27547000	if you really want to, yeah right okay everyone follow my
27547000	27551000	do your hands have calluses, rougher smooth feet question mark
27551000	27555000	I have what's called hyper hydrosis
27555000	27559000	especially in my feet and I do have it in my hands
27559000	27563000	which means my hands are always very
27563000	27567000	smooth I have no dryness because I am constantly
27567000	27571000	wet really
27571000	27575000	there's nothing else to go off by but yes I always have like
27575000	27579000	kind of moist hands so they're always soft
27579000	27583000	my feet are incredibly soft so yeah
27583000	27587000	there you go now you know I was actually going to do a donathon reward
27587000	27591000	where I give the like for a second and third place
27591000	27595000	like thigh highs that I've worn but obviously with my sweaty feet
27595000	27599000	constantly they're not like dripping not dripping I don't need
27599000	27603000	Botox if you didn't know Botox will paralyze the
27603000	27607000	sweat cells but they are constantly
27607000	27611000	having like a
27611000	27615000	they're not dry put it that way most guys hands are like
27615000	27619000	dry so when you go like when you rub your hands together it's like
27619000	27623000	but when I rub my hands well when I put my hands together I can fart
27623000	27627000	with my hands because they're always clammy and wet and
27627000	27631000	yeah that's very true I can always do that
27631000	27635000	do it on command I can never find this
27635000	27639000	most called flushed that most called flushed
27639000	27643000	I can do that breathe it in lads and lasses well you are a cuttlefish
27643000	27647000	I'd be concerned if you were tonight you're so talented sweaty hands aren't fun
27647000	27651000	yes but it's a little bit annoying especially gaming with a
27651000	27655000	controller because of the heat transfer it reflects straight
27655000	27659000	back and my hands get very sweaty when I'm using a controller
27659000	27663000	fart hands game when your hands are dry just hold Chinese
27663000	27667000	I have enough sweat to make your hands nice and soft as well
27667000	27671000	okay there's enough to go around I assure you
27681000	27685000	don't read this out loud
27687000	27691000	oh my god I'm getting intel I'm getting intel
27691000	27695000	I know you said you wouldn't ever approach other
27695000	27699000	v-tubers but considering the similarity of line of work would you ever consider a collab
27699000	27703000	with project melody both of you seem very knowledgeable and passionate about
27703000	27707000	positive A in education mental health I feel like you would be great for us
27707000	27711000	I would never say no
27711000	27715000	but at this point in time you know
27715000	27719000	I'm just gonna focus on getting the girls like their achievement stuff
27719000	27723000	I would never say no but like to reach out is quite
27723000	27727000	you know daunting I'm sure anyone can kind of relate to that kind of
27727000	27731000	thing
27731000	27735000	yeah I would never say no a lot of people said that
27735000	27739000	me and project melody seem to be like
27739000	27743000	opposites and yet the same type thing with their kind of care and all that jazz
27743000	27747000	reefing intelligent agency since you have hyper hydrolysis
27747000	27751000	do you keep yourself well hydrated the way that I can tell
27751000	27755000	I'm actually severely dehydrated as my hands go dry
27755000	27759000	that's when I know I'm like up
27759000	27763000	creek basically as if my hands stop my feet will never
27763000	27767000	stop I have never been aware of my feet stopping
27767000	27771000	sweating look at me I was always so
27771000	27775000	embarrassing as well I don't know if you guys have school dance
27775000	27779000	but I used to like rub my hands on my trousers like really quickly before
27779000	27783000	like and I'm sure I bet you my dance partner like whoever you got on the
27783000	27787000	day felt like I was doing it on purpose like oh boy
27787000	27791000	and it's like no I have a really bad sweat problem I don't want anyone to know about
27791000	27795000	it he he

27807000	27811000	I've never been to a school dance oh I guess maybe
27811000	27815000	not every country does it but we had to learn like
27815000	27819000	Scottish traditional dance like the gay garden did you say the gay garden
27819000	27823000	yes gay isn't happy ha ha ha we get it we're
27823000	27827000	called gay garden which means happy dance
27827000	27831000	never been to a school dance can't relate

27899000	27903000	dance but there was not a specific dance I had to learn ah never went
27903000	27907000	to a dance but always to the after party ooh ballin

27971000	27975000	ah
27975000	27979000	I would probably say the thing that would genuinely upset me the most
27979000	27983000	is if someone sent me something nasty about the daughters
27983000	27987000	and obviously if that starts appearing in the inbox
27987000	27991000	I know it's like not to pay heed but it's probably the worst thing I can
27991000	27995000	imagine but I would then again it was like well you're subjecting me to
27995000	27999000	not them so yeah

28211000	28215000	which I really enjoy but of course seeds don't have pollen issues on them

30015000	30019000	oh consider adoption wanted a good home
30019000	30023000	in these days of born strife the orphans of skyrim are the true victims many have no one left
30023000	30027000	to turn to and face the life of hard labour poverty and misery
30027000	30031000	if you could provide a stable home from one of these innocent children please consider adoption
30031000	30035000	so adopt from us or take in someone closer to home
30035000	30039000	you can make a difference in a child's life for more information inquire within
30039000	30043000	Constance Michelle Honorary Hall Riften
30043000	30047000	okay that is a very nice note she definitely is taking
30047000	30051000	care of those children a bit more
30051000	30055000	yes we are just going for a cheeky stab
30055000	30059000	there should be someone in a tent over here
30059000	30063000	um
30063000	30067000	I don't know if we could
30067000	30071000	I could have sworn you can speak to this person and they recognize you as someone from the dark brotherhood
30071000	30075000	but they don't do anything about it I'm like 99% sure
30075000	30079000	why are you here get away from me
30079000	30083000	you are right to be paranoid

30119000	30123000	I love that actively
30123000	30127000	I love that actively when you talk like when you do stuff in Skyrim
30127000	30131000	like the NPCs kind of discuss it I think that's such
30131000	30135000	a cool little detail I have to admit for a game for a game
30135000	30139000	that came out in 2011 and was produced like before that
30139000	30143000	that's pretty that's pretty decent you know
30143000	30147000	are you gonna give it to them sometimes can't can't give them all the credit
30147000	30151000	but you gotta give it to them sometimes unfortunately I believe we
30151000	30155000	do we have to go south no we don't I'm just taking
30155000	30159000	super long obnoxious way so I'm going to teleport back
30159000	30163000	and then I'm basically just gonna go along the war's edge to get to this dawn star
30163000	30167000	death is highly over here
30167000	30171000	infamous last words
30171000	30175000	so warhammer stuff literally oh you didn't see it coming

30231000	30235000	much power and then I get high on it and I just do it all the time
30235000	30239000	I'm not being funny that girl gave me far too much power

30279000	30283000	sorry I am I am going to redirect into
30283000	30287000	mercy because unfortunately my achievements bugged out so
30287000	30291000	it kind of may or may not have defeated the whole purpose of this achievement

30335000	30339000	with north west so I can't even
30339000	30343000	talk I'm getting flustered thinking there's a girl watching me with a
30343000	30347000	fuck okay right I'm just going to converse this straight off the bat
30347000	30351000	so I used to play Call of Duty and whenever there was like a girl on my team I used to get really
30351000	30355000	flustered and I couldn't even talk properly I don't know why I just like completely
30355000	30359000	clam up and I'm just like uh uh uh and I just get really like freaking terrible
30359000	30363000	about it so it's really I don't know why I still haven't come over
30363000	30367000	yet because I played a few rounds of valorant and it happened there was a girl on my team and I
30367000	30371000	couldn't speak at all and voice chat and I don't know what it is
30371000	30375000	and it's not even like I'm trying to like impress her or anything I just like get all weird
30375000	30379000	and like I don't want to bother her you know I'm being weirdo
30379000	30383000	I'm like it's not like I'm trying to like
30383000	30387000	pick someone up or anything and I'm like freaking Call of Duty I don't know why I get all clammed up
30387000	30391000	and it's happening it's literally happening right now in live stream and I'm like oh my god now everyone knows I'm a weirdo
30391000	30395000	and I'm like uh I'm freaking talking to wham this hard
30395000	30399000	better not better not speaking and starting
30399000	30403000	to say bad jokes she's just like the majority of guys
30403000	30407000	clamming up like basically every other
30407000	30411000	cod player of honestly
30411000	30415000	girls are steering
30415000	30419000	wait until she really so the reason
30419000	30423000	why it feels like it's different for valorant girls is because
30423000	30427000	like I'm not trying to
30427000	30431000	I'm not like trying to
30431000	30435000	you know get anything out of them no that sounds really odd that makes it sound like
30435000	30439000	I'm freaking honing in that sounds really odd hold on
30439000	30443000	hold on let me think anything
30443000	30447000	I can't imagine anything bad happening if we give one person all the power

31175000	31179000	I don't know what the word is

31235000	31239000	just because of the love
31239000	31243000	and everything that we did
31243000	31247000	the girls and I couldn't have predicted anything at all
31247000	31251000	it was impossible to predict and we were dealing with
31251000	31255000	a major calling at the time which was really messing
31255000	31259000	with like how to predict anything at all

32509000	32513000	my collab is actually power washer sim where you get to see us all together
32513000	32517000	because someone not naming names, refling
32517000	32521000	guessed the entire reason why we're playing power washer first
32521000	32525000	out of all the games of course you had to figure out what the freaking plot was
32525000	32529000	but yes
32529000	32533000	I will see you giffy givers tomorrow brushing your teeth

32557000	32561000	tomorrow is getting bulldozed
32561000	32565000	for monetization celebration so be there or be a square
32565000	32569000	I won't be up for too long definitely not an endurance stream
32569000	32573000	but please don't worry if you can't make it the void will remain up I will be

32593000	32597000	it should remain up
32597000	32601000	and I think that's everything I have to say
32601000	32605000	it's possible do we have to stagger our monetization

32657000	32661000	you're joking please tell me you're trolling me
32661000	32665000	and it's not 599
