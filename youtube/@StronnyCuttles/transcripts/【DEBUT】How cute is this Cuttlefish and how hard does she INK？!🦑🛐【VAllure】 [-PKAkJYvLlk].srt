15
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,280
I feel so so inspired.

16
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,720
I mean, my people used to do that, that's so cool.

17
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,680
I mean, I've never fed on a human before,

18
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,840
and the smartest thing I've ever hypnotized is a seal.

19
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,560
But learning that my ancestors used to eat humans by the literal boatloads was amazing.

20
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,960
I couldn't wait to grow up and eat my fill.

21
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,200
Fat ones, tall ones, skinny ones, even hairy ones.

22
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,800
Though I learned our people aren't as feared by humans as they once were.

23
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:41,680
My ocean, my home, humans defile it with their presence, worse still, they toss their filth into it,

24
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,160
further insulting us. How could this have happened? How were we brought so low from our past?

25
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,760
They used to tell legends on every port that made even the most straight-laced superstition scoffing

26
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,200
marines keep on the back of their minds. They would dedicate figureheads of their ships in respect

27
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:07,600
to our beautiful yet delicate bodies. They put us on every map, but now? Ugh, disgusting humans.

28
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,880
One night, I envisioned a genius plan, the first strike in my crusade against the human world.

29
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,400
I would infiltrate in hijack a fishing vessel and use it as my own pirate vessel with a crew of

30
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,240
hypnotised thralls. I was going to wage a once siren war against all of humanity.

31
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,360
It was going to be perfect, and I definitely would have won. That was until I envisioned a plan

32
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,640
that was even more perfect. Er, well, at least more time efficient. Making my way below deck,

33
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:51,360
I made a strange discovery. The humans were hypnotised by their own choice. I couldn't believe it.

34
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:58,800
I looked at boat after boat. These humans charmed like a siren's spell, even dedicated their

35
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:07,600
lives to their chosen idols. These idols they fawn over were these sirens too. That's it. That's

36
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,720
the secret to defeating the humans. I'm going to find the secret to their magic and harness this

37
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,680
power myself and bring power back to my people. I must gather fame, fortune, scandals, anything

38
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,120
and everything to grow my influence over mankind to bring sirens back into the minds of the people.

39
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,360
But I'm not just going to tip the scales. I'm going for complete domination.

40
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,120
Every human will bend to my will. All will be cheering for their own demise. I will be the

41
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,120
instrument of karmic justice. The world will worship me and praise my name as I bring about their

42
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,680
end. I will march every human under my control into the ocean and my people will chant my name as they

43
00:09:51,680 --> 00:10:02,320
have a feeding frenzy that has written into legend. Though that's a very long term goal.

44
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:11,200
With every big venture, whether business wise or lifestyle, every big undertaking starts small scale.

45
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:21,280
Right? Hmm. So, I think I'll start with you.

46
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,280
You wanted a feral kusugaki? I gave you a feral kusugaki.

47
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,320
You wanted a doten hag? I gave you a doten hag.

48
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,200
You wanted a dorky yandere? I gave you a dorky yandere.

49
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,960
You wanted a masochistic brocon? I gave you a masochistic brocon.

50
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,680
You wanted a milk dominatrix? I gave you a milk dominatrix.

51
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:18,160
And now, I bring you the vichu bird that no one asked for. A god damn nutty cuttlefish.

52
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:46,160
No copyright. No copyright. No copyright intended, bros. Come on, come on, come on. Relax, relax.

53
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:59,360
Did I kick or did I fucking kick, ladies and gentlemen? Have you enjoyed your evening so far?

54
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,360
Have you been warmed up by my girls?

55
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Who stole your heart the most? Was it A.C., the feral polar bear, or was it Azura, the literal definition of mommy milkers?

56
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Or what about Mercy, the yandere that can never love right? I mean, she got plenty of love to give, doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna be alive at the end of it, okay?

57
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:31,360
But hey ho, you know, you still get love done at the end of the day. Or was it Emmy, the most controversially created character of all time?

58
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:39,360
But hey ho, look, we're just gonna skip past that. You know, if you ignore the lore, everything else is fine. It's fine. It's fine. Stop worrying.

59
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,360
You guys are such a blurry war, honestly. Or was it Madame Shuby herself?

60
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:55,360
Because, you know, gonna be honest, didn't really get many requests for a hypnotic cuttlefish, that's Scottish, but hey ho, hey ho, that's how it goes, that's how it goes.

61
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:05,360
There's something made me, let me formally introduce myself. Look at these sleighs, they're so pretty, they're so pretty.

62
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:15,360
I, ladies and gentlemen, am Strony Cuttles. Please, Cuttles, the surname is because I'm a Cuttlefish.

63
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:24,360
Oh, shock of any. And Strony, because I am Strony, the daughter of the gamer Strontyum.

64
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,360
My dad's gamer tag is Strontyum. No, it's not actually Strontyum, before you're like, oh my god, you just dox your dad.

65
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:37,360
No, relax, it's not actually literally really, you know, Stronyum, but I'm Strony, Cuttles, I'm named after my dad.

66
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,360
My dad's gamer, and I wouldn't be here without him, you know, because he came from his ballsack.

67
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Anyway, age, age, ladies and gentlemen, oh, yet again, I have failed the VTuber challenge of tell us your age.

68
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,360
It's not really looking good, okay, it's not looking good.

69
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Cuttlefish normally live to a year, so time's ticking, time is ticking.

70
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:08,360
Anyway, my birthday is October 10th, which is actually National Squid and Cuttlefish Day.

71
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,360
They're both cephalopods, so I don't mind sharing that birthday with the Squid VTubers if there's any of these out there.

72
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:25,360
My height is 162cm, which makes me 5'3", because I forgot to update the slide like Adapte, but hey, hold, we're here now.

73
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:40,360
For my languages, turns out, if you're born in Scotland, the British government recognises Scottish slang as its own language, so in your face, I can speak two languages, so...

74
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,360
It's fantastic with that.

75
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
Show us your plaster.

76
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
No!

77
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
Oh God, can you see it?

78
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,360
Wait, you're not supposed to see that part, yeah!

79
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,360
Like, I had to censor myself, my design's a little saucy.

80
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Anyway, what was I saying?

81
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:28,360
A-Smart, if you like A-Smart, me and my gen mates are all literally A-Smart out of the wazoo.

82
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,360
So don't be shy to like or subscribe on any of them.

83
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,360
I'll give you a bigger hint than that, but hey, hold.

84
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,360
I like seeing victory on my screen, because I could use any tiddly wink of serotonin possible.

85
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,360
And, you know, you get it from playing multiplayer games, and you're in the same boat as me.

86
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,360
And I also like plasters and band-aids.

87
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,360
For no nefarious reason, of course.

88
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,360
For my dislikes, grrr, you know, hate is a strong word for my dislikes instead, grrr.

89
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,360
I don't like bullies in video games.

90
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,360
Your teammates aren't often a magically beat MLG pro, so relax.

91
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,360
You don't have fun, it's a multiplayer game, it's a game.

92
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
Just enjoy yourself, okay?

93
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
I don't like serious people.

94
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
I don't like seriousness.

95
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:24,360
I think my gen mates can all pray for each boutch that I am the most un-serious and ridiculous.

96
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
I can't be serious.

97
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
It's terrible.

98
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,360
I'm the most unprofessional person they've probably ever worked with in their entire life.

99
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,360
And I don't like Mongolian throat singing.

100
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
I'm so sorry.

101
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,360
People seem to really like it, but I don't.

102
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
It doesn't sound nice.

103
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,360
So, I apologize to the one Mongolian throat singer that's watching right now.

104
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
I just can't.

105
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
Okay, I'm nice and generic.

106
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
Sorry, there's nothing interesting about my taste.

107
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,360
Movies, Lord of the Rings, best as we come.

108
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,360
Animes, nice and generic again.

109
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,360
Books.

110
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
I actually started reading books this year.

111
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,360
I know it sounds crazy at the end because people read books in general.

112
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,360
Me?

113
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,360
However, I started this year.

114
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,360
I really like dystopian books that talk about human nature and how humans are stinky poo poo heads.

115
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,360
For some reason, they just really capture me.

116
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,360
I like being depressed after reading a book.

117
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,360
For my music, Hatsune Miku and Atarashi Gako,

118
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,360
I want to see them live if it's possible.

119
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
Yeah, sorry, it's like choking my spit.

120
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,360
Oh, yeah.

121
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
Just a wee bit of a gamer.

122
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,360
A tiny bit of a gamer.

123
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
It doesn't mean I'm good at games.

124
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,360
Now, before there's that one person that's like,

125
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,360
eh, you've played all these games.

126
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
That means you're an MLG pro.

127
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
No, relax, relax.

128
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,360
I've played games full stop, okay?

129
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,360
These are the games that I remember playing

130
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,360
or just kind of like have a good,

131
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,360
yeah, play them type thing, okay?

132
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,360
So, you might have a few things in common.

133
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,360
I could, you know, move out of the way.

134
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,360
There's some Lego games, I still love my Lego games.

135
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,360
But yeah, these are all the games that I remember playing.

136
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
There's tons that I've obviously missed out on

137
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,360
that are like so tiny that it's kind of hard to mention.

138
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,360
But there's a big old square red for you

139
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,360
as we see it was about an Xbox gamer to apologize.

140
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,360
The old Call of Duty days.

141
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,360
Yeah.

142
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
For my goals,

143
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
I want to get monetized on YouTube.

144
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
So, feel free to subscribe

145
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,360
because we have been called like crazy

146
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
since announcing ourselves.

147
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
And we need watch hours.

148
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,360
So, don't be shy to rewatch anything

149
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,360
that is offered on the channel to you.

150
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
I want to stream so much

151
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,360
that you can basically read everything in my voice.

152
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,360
And, you know, you'll be Scots yourself

153
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,360
and you can apply for citizenship

154
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,360
and all that good stuff.

155
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,360
I also want to create a mega Ace more collab

156
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,360
with my gen mates,

157
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,360
which I've already got quite a few on the way.

158
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,360
So, don't worry, it's coming.

159
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,360
You just got to wait, okay?

160
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,360
I have a childhood dream, actually,

161
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,360
of a 100,000 gamer score.

162
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,360
And it's actually possible now with Xbox Game Pass.

163
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,360
I would absolutely love to explore

164
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,360
a heken amount of

165
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,360
childhood games.

166
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,360
And I would love to play

167
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,360
like your childhood games as well,

168
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,360
because obviously I was kind of at the mercy

169
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,360
of what my dad would buy me for childhood games,

170
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,360
so it doesn't quite count.

171
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,360
So, here's a little fun factoid about me.

172
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,360
I'm a wee bit of a workaholic.

173
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,360
So, I would like to say that for every 1000 subscribers

174
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,360
I get on my YouTube channel,

175
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,360
I'm going to upload a celebratory

176
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,360
really hard to say that if you're Scottish,

177
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,360
celebrate it already.

178
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,360
Ace more video, pair 1000 subscribers.

179
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,360
I've already got like tons

180
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,360
ready to go, so don't be shy.

181
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,360
You know what to do, wink, wink.

182
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,360
I also want to challenge myself.

183
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,360
I want to collab.

184
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
I want to make Ace more collab

185
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,360
with over 100 different beatubers.

186
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,360
And I'm actually so much of a workaholic.

187
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,360
I already have three confirmed

188
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,360
with beatubers outside of VLR, so...

189
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,360
I'm very serious about that.

190
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,360
If you ever have a 3DO, you're a beatuber,

191
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,360
I'm coming to find you in your DMs.

192
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,360
I would love if we could read Lord of the Rings together.

193
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
I think it would be so fun.

194
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,360
I'm not a very strong reader,

195
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,360
but I think it would be really cute to do like a little

196
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
before the end of stream.

197
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,360
We read one chapter or something like that.

198
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,360
And last, but certainly not least,

199
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,360
I would love to get stream sniped.

200
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,360
I absolutely adore it.

201
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,360
I love playing multiplayer games

202
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,360
where you can join me,

203
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,360
and you can have an amazing time,

204
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,360
and have so much fun.

205
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,360
It's just one of my favourite things, okay?

206
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,360
So please do not be shy.

207
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,360
Every week I plan on playing multiplayer games

208
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,360
where you can join me at any point.

209
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,360
I will try to make them free and accessible

210
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
as I can, but yes, yes, yes.

211
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,360
These are my goals. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

212
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
I'm dumb.

213
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
Okay, I'm really dumb.

214
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,360
I don't know how to come up with tags.

215
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,360
I'm not funny. I'm not good with puns.

216
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,360
So I am more than happy to take any suggestion.

217
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,360
We can figure it out very soon.

218
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,360
Don't worry, okay?

219
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,360
My Oshi marks are squid,

220
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,360
but I'm a cuttlefish,

221
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,360
but squids and cuttlefish are cephalopods,

222
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
so I don't mind sharing the emoji.

223
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,360
And then the second emoji

224
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,360
kind of looks like a man bowing.

225
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,360
Hmm? Hmm?

226
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,360
Maybe that is a hint to what I might

227
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,360
try to make content-wise.

228
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,360
And for fan names,

229
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
there is only going to be one option.

230
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,360
Come on, let's not beat around the bush.

231
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,360
You are my refling.

232
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
You will always be my refling.

233
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
And thank you so fucking much for waiting.

234
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
I have bloody missed you.

235
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,360
Special shout out to

236
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,360
Nari

237
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,360
and Squishy Girl.

238
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,360
You may have noticed a bit of a

239
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,360
trending pattern, right?

240
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,360
A bit of a trending pattern.

241
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,360
Squishy Girl,

242
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,360
conceptualized us all

243
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,360
and now I helped out

244
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,360
and made us come to life, which is beautiful, beautiful.

245
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,360
And also, as a little mini announcement,

246
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,360
the official VLR website

247
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,360
will be updated shortly.

248
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,360
And everyone who created the Gen 1

249
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,360
is going to be credited on the website.

250
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,360
So you will see these names very soon

251
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,360
on that website once the update comes out.

252
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,360
So thank you everyone who came together

253
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,360
to make this fantastic gen

254
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,360
of indulge.

255
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,360
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

256
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,360
No, no.

257
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,360
Most people get to do

258
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,360
Oh, this is my gen mate's impression.

259
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
Okay? Gen mate's impression.

260
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,360
Me, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

261
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
I picked

262
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,360
my gen mate's. Do you understand?

263
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,360
I picked them, okay?

264
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
They're all going to tell you why I picked them.

265
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,360
You ready for this?

266
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,360
Mercy's determination.

267
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
She was going to make it no matter what.

268
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,360
A little determining, like,

269
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,360
the definition of mercy in the dictionary

270
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
if you look it up, it just says determined, okay?

271
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,360
There was no way and heck she was not going to get in.

272
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,360
That's all I'm going to say on that one.

273
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,360
And then Emmy

274
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,360
I'm going to have to be

275
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,360
Emmy

276
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,360
say to someone

277
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,360
who's being rid to her

278
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,360
to keep themselves safe in Minecraft

279
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,360
and then she instantly got the part, okay?

280
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,360
I say, I say, oh, I say

281
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,360
has fantastic

282
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,360
experience

283
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,360
in history and she's such a hard worker.

284
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,360
She gives her best, okay?

285
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,360
She gives everything 100%

286
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,360
and it was absolutely beautiful.

287
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,360
And she actually, she had the most

288
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,360
professional application

289
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,360
even though English isn't her first language

290
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,360
and I'm like, god damn, A.C.,

291
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,360
you're fucking impressive.

292
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,360
Then Azura,

293
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,360
okay, I describe Azura

294
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,360
as my little diamond in the rough.

295
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,360
Now hear me out before you're like,

296
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,360
isn't that an insult? Relax.

297
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,360
I'm not told the full story yet, my goodness, you're jumping the gun.

298
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,360
I

299
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,360
was going to

300
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,360
cross off Azura's

301
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,360
stream as I was reviewing her

302
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,360
because she wasn't talking, she wasn't interacting

303
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,360
and she wasn't really doing anything

304
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,360
and then she said three words

305
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,360
in that voice.

306
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
Azura!

307
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,360
She instantly became Azura.

308
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,360
She said three words and she got the damn part

309
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,360
and she was like, in that voice, in that part.

310
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,360
I can't mimic her voice, okay?

311
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,360
But

312
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,360
I need gold.

313
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,360
Rosyksu!

314
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,360
Rosyksu.

315
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,360
And Sheevee. Sheevee is everything

316
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,360
I should have been in another life, okay?

317
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,360
She is going very far.

318
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,360
I'm very happy, absolutely.

319
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,360
I could not have asked for

320
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,360
better gen mates. I am blown away

321
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,360
that these girls even have

322
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,360
fucking applied to such a crazy idea.

323
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,360
And here we are,

324
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,360
debut and you guys have shown

325
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,360
nothing but love and support

326
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,360
and we are all so thankful.

327
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,360
I'm sure I speak for all of us when we were like

328
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,360
holy fuck, thank you.

329
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,360
Because we didn't expect any of this.

330
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,360
We're just like, yeah, we're just going to be my bird.

331
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,360
Ray, let me take you to

332
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,360
Zabbe.

333
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,360
Oh, I forgot

334
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,360
to pull you. It's for decoration, okay?

335
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,360
The tentacle in the back is for decoration.

336
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,360
I won't, no questions.

337
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,360
Let me do the full body.

338
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,360
Let's start with the full body.

339
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,360
May have a bandaid on for

340
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,360
reasons.

341
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,360
But as you can see, I got some

342
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,360
swivelly hips, thank you.

343
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,360
We'll start from the bottom.

344
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,360
You know how it is, okay?

345
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,360
So if you didn't know, I actually

346
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,360
have what's known as a French manicure

347
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,360
and pedicure.

348
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,360
So you can see my little

349
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,360
toenails.

350
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,360
This is French manicure pedicure.

351
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,360
And then you go up my face.

352
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,360
And

353
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,360
don't even be careful at my thighs because of the bandaid.

354
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,360
Is this smart? Is this white?

355
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,360
Okay, okay, I don't think that's white. Okay, check it out.

356
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,360
See look, I've got

357
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,360
oh, my voice is cracking.

358
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,360
I've got a French pedicure

359
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,360
manicure. See?

360
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,360
We're just going to skip past the bottom part, okay?

361
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,360
And as you can see

362
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,360
if you look really close to the elbows

363
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,360
I have pearlescent

364
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,360
to my outfit. My outfit isn't white

365
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,360
it's pearlescent.

366
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,360
So I shimmer as I move about.

367
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,360
It's fantastic. And so there's my

368
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,360
seashells at the top too.

369
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,360
If you look at real close

370
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,360
you have to really look for it.

371
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,360
But look, I'm a shiny little seashell.

372
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,360
What do you think?

373
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,360
It's good, no?

374
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,360
Yeah, I'm in the Yukata

375
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,360
because

376
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,360
it's a homage to Japanese culture

377
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,360
because without Japanese culture, let's be honest

378
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,360
maybe trippers would be here

379
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,360
so

380
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,360
you know, go a little bit catagona.

381
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,360
Okay, let me

382
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,360
let me get real close. Hopefully this isn't uncomfortable.

383
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,360
I know some people aren't like

384
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,360
the best with eye contact

385
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,360
but look, don't, it's me. It's me, okay?

386
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,360
I'm a brain.

387
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,360
Oh, the star.

388
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,360
I

389
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,360
I like

390
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,360
if I open my eyes

391
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,360
it opens

392
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,360
I love you so much.

393
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,360
Oh and I'm sad

394
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,360
I'm sad please.

395
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
Better not upset me, go subscribe

396
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,360
to my gem me. You upset

397
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,360
me.

398
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,360
I have pupil restrict like

399
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,360
what did you say?

400
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,360
I'm unamused.

401
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,360
You failed me.

402
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,360
I don't know, I can't do it.

403
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,360
I can't do it the way she does it.

404
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,360
She's just off the top of her head and I'm like

405
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,360
These are my heart eyes. I love them.

406
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,360
And like, okay

407
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,360
this is just my opinion but do you see how

408
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,360
my neck is doing that thing where

409
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,360
in the chin area and it disappears?

410
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,360
Oh, I love it so much

411
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,360
in beach of remodels when they do it.

412
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
Oh, I love it.

413
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,360
I love it.

414
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,360
You're good.

415
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,360
You're trying to make me blush,

416
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,360
would you?

417
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,360
Have you ever seen a blushing coffee before?

418
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,360
Oh, actually this is a very good point.

419
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Some people don't like

420
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,360
backseat gaming.

421
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,360
I'm the opposite.

422
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,360
I'm very dumb.

423
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,360
I'm very happy for you a backseat game.

424
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,360
So you're probably going to see this one a lot

425
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,360
if you care to watch me at any point.

426
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,360
I got

427
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,360
I don't know

428
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,360
I swear

429
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,360
I'm looking at my jammies all day.

430
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,360
Like, come on, the designs are good.

431
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,360
Don't lie.

432
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,360
Oh, oh

433
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,360
I might have spoiled it there

434
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,360
but you know how

435
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,360
cuttlefish have hypnotic patterns?

436
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,360
May I please

437
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,360
do this for you? Are you ready?

438
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,360
I

439
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,360
I

440
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,360
Yes

441
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,360
We're going to be using this for a lot of ASMR.

442
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,360
You wouldn't fall for my hypnotic

443
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,360
capabilities.

444
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,360
But if you're really struggling

445
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,360
like if you're really struggling

446
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,360
How about this?

447
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,360
Yeah

448
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,360
Yeah

449
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,360
Yeah

450
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,360
Yeah

451
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,360
It's over for you. Just admit it.

452
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,360
It's over for you.

453
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,360
I mean, how can you resist?

454
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,360
How can you resist this little Scottish accent?

455
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,360
Right

456
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,360
Right, right attend

457
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,360
Schedule time

458
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,360
So

459
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,360
my jammies are all doing

460
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,360
debut 2.0

461
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,360
which is fantastic

462
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,360
Me on the other hand

463
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,360
I'm exposing the damn company

464
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,360
I've had enough of VLR

465
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,360
I'm exposing every little

466
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,360
dirty secret they have

467
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,360
So if you're excited

468
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,360
to know the ins and outs of what it's like

469
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,360
to run a VTuber agency

470
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,360
to create one, to fund one

471
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,360
to know what goes on behind the scenes

472
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,360
that's right

473
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,360
and you can show up to my stream the more

474
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,360
So

475
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,360
Obviously

476
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,360
I'm playing the greatest game of all time

477
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,360
in my first week

478
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,360
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

479
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,360
I will not be taking any statements

480
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,360
any questions

481
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,360
and any threats about claiming

482
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,360
that Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is not the

483
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,360
greatest game of all time

484
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,360
So sorry, not sorry, but yeah

485
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,360
We also have needy streamer overload

486
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,360
James Cameron's Avatar

487
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,360
which is such a niche game

488
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,360
2 people who are watching this right now

489
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,360
probably played it

490
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,360
The multiplayer game of the week is old school runescape

491
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,360
if you'd like to do some co-esting with me

492
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,360
I'm also doing an ASMR stream

493
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,360
and

494
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,360
a hand cam stream

495
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,360
where I'm trying foreign sweets

496
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,360
or can die

497
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,360
if you're American

498
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,360
or if you're Australian

499
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,360
you say lollipops

500
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,360
So yeah, we did a little

501
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,360
cheeky hand cam stream

502
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,360
I think there's

503
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,360
a few hand cam streams coming up from

504
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,360
my gen mates already

505
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,360
Someone was surprised I was doing hand cam

506
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,360
and I'm like

507
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,360
I mean

508
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,360
we're not like

509
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,360
I don't know what part kind of tips you off that

510
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,360
we're not like other agencies unironically

511
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,360
like was it the 80-20 split

512
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,360
maybe did that tip you off

513
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,360
or like the 100% marriage sales got the talent

514
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,360
was it that part that tips you off that

515
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,360
we're not quite like any other agency

516
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,360
but yeah

517
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,360
let's go to

518
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,360
Chewatt

519
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,360
that's a lot of movement

520
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,360
but yes, that is my first week

521
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,360
I'm pretty much an endurance streamer

522
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,360
so good luck keeping up with me

523
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,360
okay

524
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,360
Emmy Dookie

525
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,360
Emmy

526
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,360
right

527
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,360
thank you all so much

528
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,360
we are all going to collectively have a 30 minute rest

529
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,360
and then guess what

530
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,360
you get to see us all interact together

531
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,360
live

532
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,360
okay we're going to be telling some funny stories

533
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,360
some rather embarrassing stories

534
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,360
but hey ho it's good content

535
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,360
it's good content that's right

536
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,360
and I will thank you

537
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,360
also much for all the love that we've shown myself

538
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,360
or my gen mates at will

539
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,360
and we will see you in 30 minutes

540
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,360
you will automatically be redirected

541
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,360
into the lovely group room

542
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,360
and we will see you in 30 minutes okay

543
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,360
can you wait 30 minutes

544
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,360
30 more minutes

545
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,360
okay I'll see you then

546
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,360
okay thank you so much

547
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,360
