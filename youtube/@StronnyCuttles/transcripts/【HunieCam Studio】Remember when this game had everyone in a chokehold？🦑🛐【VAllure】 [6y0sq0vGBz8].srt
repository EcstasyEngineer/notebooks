1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,280
I forgot my shirt went live, eeps, eepsie

2
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:40,720
good morning, good evening, good afternoon little reflens, you see me?

3
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,820
okay I know we're on the just chatting screen okay, I know we're not on the game screen

4
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:53,680
and you're probably shitting your pantelones okay, but we have an absolute fantastic update

5
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:06,360
which I can't talk about, I'm allowed to talk about it now okay, Viallure officially

6
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,520
have partnered with gamersupps, eepie, all the girls' descriptions will be updated and

7
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,840
they'll be tweets made very shortly, but Viallure are officially partnered with gamersupps

8
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,800
you can use everyone's name as a checkout code for 10% off, I'm not even trolling, yes

9
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:31,040
they really happened, I don't know how it happened, but it happened, gamersupps thumbs

10
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,600
up, we love gamersupps, as always the girls get to keep 100% of the earnings, Viallure

11
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,680
do not touch it because I don't want to touch it okay, I finally can buy strongy's sweat

12
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,400
well apparently there's a flavour called Isaac Tears which is so awesome, Viallure's

13
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,880
descriptions will get updated soon, there will be tweets made very shortly, what is

14
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
that?

15
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,760
it is an energy drinks company, but you can also get non-caffeinated beverages as well,

16
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:14,840
but yeah it's another income source for the girlies and I'm so happy, but yeah that was

17
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:31,240
my big news that was kind of like lurking around in the background, I got a new short

18
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,000
that got uploaded as well, I'm just reading some of the comments on it, strongy is neurodivergent

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,800
if that's true base, at one point screams I'm freaking normal, now you can get a taste

20
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,600
of mummy, I mean after the last run it was obvious you're the final gamer, that's why

21
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:55,760
they wanted a piece of me, blame the tism, yep blame the tism, but yes I have a new short

22
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,920
if you haven't seen it yet, it's about how the background musics are all about sonic

23
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,240
heroes which actually came in really good timing because we literally just played sonic

24
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:15,560
heroes, sonic heroes, I will definitely do an endurance, it's some comment, oh I thought

25
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,240
this is about how the veiler company was being made up of lootubers was the exposing, I didn't

26
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:27,080
know it was going to be about background music plagiarising, my guys not that serious, it's

27
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,560
not called plagiarism, it's called influence, have you heard of influence before? I've

28
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,160
approved the comment anyway but what the fuck it's not actually really exposing the fucking

29
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:48,120
company what the fuck, I also had an offline tip so thank you spidey for the offline tip,

30
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:57,560
they put tess for some reason, I don't know why, Mr Beast collab when? Mr, Mr, Mr Beast,

31
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,440
oh but speaking of things that are coming up soon, now this one's just coming up for

32
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:10,440
me and it was you coming up for me, hey let's go we got an update, check it out, I'm poignant

33
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,440
with you, look at your little little, I like how you've already somehow got the nicotine

34
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:21,560
patch on your head, I'm leaving it because it's true to your design, but check us out

35
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:28,440
together, we're so cute, so we've got this version that's coming along very quickly,

36
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:35,040
the artist is working so hard and diligently, that's version one which is like a full, that's

37
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,560
like the line art if you will, and then we've got Colored in Tommy, Colored in Tommy me,

38
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:49,880
I'm so cute, but we're gonna have like an x-ray shot so I'm about to be able to do the see-through

39
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:57,920
view of you and my tum tum and then I have some cursed ASMR to record, I actually came up with a

40
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:03,720
new meme ASMR and it's absolutely horrifying, wait I might be able to find it in my notes because

41
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:11,240
I wrote it down, Scottish e-girl Miaw is like a cat for money ASMR, I know that sounds really weird

42
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:20,040
out of context, I have a picture to go with it okay, and it's basically like you're my sugar daddy

43
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:26,880
but I'm Scottish, so you're like Miaw for me and I'm like I'm not gonna Miaw for you and it's like

44
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,280
do you need the money and I'm like I guess, I'll mention like the steam summer sales which are

45
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:39,000
finishing today by the way if you haven't picked up any games on steam summer sales do it, and that's

46
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,640
the only reason we're on the screen okay, where's my game, where's my game, are you squidding me

74
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:35,080
was anything that there shouldn't be but I didn't really look like that, um giving kitsune, thanks

00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:09,320
it will not perish you, tiny spiny, team chaotic, the detectives that you want on your side, team

00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:16,120
chaotic, the detectives tracking down your crime, wait did they have a motto like that, there's honey

81
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:22,120
pop from the same devs, yes, I think honey pop is the puzzle one but I didn't want to play the puzzle

82
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:29,080
one, I wanted to play veal or simulator because originally I was gonna play idle manager but

83
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:38,040
apparently it's super hard, dragon dread again karma, what glorious month fellow leafling

leafling, inner wit, thanks for everything mome, looking forward to the next 30 years of streams,

87
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,600
would you still watch me if I was a girl streamer, not even a hag, will surpass hag by then,

88
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,680
would you watch me if I was a girl streamer, pretty please, will you watch my running commentary

89
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:19,720
on our yearly playthrough of camryo and picking up the fruits on one go, asterix love, sure yeah

90
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,280
background music still on, you're absolutely correct leafling, thank goodness you got that

91
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:31,000
cause I certainly would not have if I didn't read that comment, viral momello, are you squidding me

92
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:39,560
right now, Scottish gilf let's go, heck yeah, okay let's play it, so this game came out and

93
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,160
everyone was in a freaking chokehold over it, I'm not really sure I'd watch you even if I were one,

94
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:51,400
okay, what's the point of living without watching mommy play childhood games, I was watching this

95
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:57,160
then streamer do, are you squidding me right now, like a media share thing, prosdino, ever since

96
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,240
violers debut, I've slept less than, oh well, we might be on the same page, I'm gonna be honest

97
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,200
leafling, but I also feel a lot more energized so it cancels it out, thanks mommy, hi you're welcome,

98
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,920
I had a big sleep, I slept for like seven hours after stream and then I've just slept for, I want

99
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:24,760
to say five hours there, so I'm gonna slurp my tea, hold on, oh no I've just accepted, the stream's

100
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:34,520
gonna be, they're limited ads, it's fine, yearly cameo placer, I'd be really down for it, like I

101
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,480
just, I'll eat cameo, I'm sorry, it's like such a good game, you can wrap it up, or wrap it up,

102
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:46,520
seven hours is a big sleep, well it is in consideration that I had two hours the previous day,

103
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:56,120
are you squidding me right now, oh soul insert, coming out with the lore, actually I remember

104
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:02,440
honeycam studio came out with negative reception, because of the different art style and lack of

105
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,360
scenes, I'd buy veal or something, I considered it, I considered producing a vn at one point,

106
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,080
because they're a lot cheaper than the average game, it might officially be the first game I'd

107
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:21,320
produce, I would not base it after the veal or girls just because you never know what will happen,

108
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,080
you know I might do something catastrophic, although I did say to the girls if I ever do

109
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:30,120
anything bad take me around back and shoot me, do not ever let me live long enough to become the bad

110
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,400
guy, and they were all giggling, but I don't think they realised how serious that was, I was like

111
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:41,240
take me out back and shoot me, do not let me be the bad guy, okay, do not ever let me act like

112
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,760
you know the very thing I swore to destroy, don't let me be great, as I said we've got

113
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:54,040
gamersups codes, our updates will all be updated soon, there'll be graphics added to stream soon,

114
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:01,080
and there'll be tweets about it as well, they are so kind to getting that organised,

115
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,280
but as always the girls get to keep 100% of what they earned through that code,

116
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,280
veal or don't touch it, go straight to their accounts, they will attest to this because

117
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:18,120
I'm about to have to get them to sort out their accounts, what are you playing, don't look okay,

118
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,760
don't look, recon crusader, love you goddess, love you replaying,

119
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,920
but yes the girls have gamersups accounts, if you wanted to activate the code right now,

120
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,960
just use the code and then their name, if you literally mersey, we everyone got their first

121
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:42,920
name, so strony, mersey, azura, emmy, ac, mersey, asad mersey, you're gonna miss him,

122
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:53,240
ac, emmy, azura, shibi, mersey, strony, oh I'll go everyone, okay, I was like hold on a minute

123
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:59,080
something, I don't know, sassapress, one month ago I fell in love with you and I predict that for

124
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:05,160
the foreseeable future I shall be in love with you, here's to many more months mommy, I just added

125
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:12,840
that myself as a thank you for falling in love, get plapped, get plapped, get plapped,

126
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:22,840
could you imagine an azura waifu cup, unfortunately I'm not sure how gamersups works,

127
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,000
I will ask permission to see if I'm allowed to discuss certain things but at this moment in time,

128
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:34,840
I'm a good girl, gamersups pog, so if you ever wanted to try gamersups, I'm actually gonna make a

129
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:42,680
handcam ASMR video about them because they are very kind and they're willing to send out PR packages

130
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,920
so I get to ASMR muck about with their products, so that'll be fun, zero thank you for the one

131
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,360
month, love you mommy, congrats on everything on this one month, can't wait to spend more time with

132
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:01,560
you, let's go! Just so you know, aside from the main theme, all four teams from Sonic Heroes

133
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:08,440
have a theme song, we can for Team Sonic, this machine for Team Dark, follow me for Team Rose

134
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:15,080
and Team Chaotix for Team Chaotix, listen to them all, they're bangers, oh yeah that took me by

135
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:21,160
surprise when we were playing against Team Rose, my voice is absolutely correct otherwise so thank

136
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,600
you tiny spainy for the tip, yeah I got so surprised, I started hearing, I was like lyrics

137
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:33,480
and songs in this game, I wonder what mommy's flavor would be, probably pish, no no one's gonna

138
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:44,920

139
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:51,080
kind of insider stuff I can mention because it's nothing to do with me so for once I can't even

140
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:57,720
be transparent, something behavior, hey thank you zero, I don't actually think I said your name when

143
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:23,160
Honey Cam Studios, this is a, uh, simulator strategy building game, I am so bad at identifying

144
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:30,600
game types, I'm not even kidding, I am absolutely rotten at it, it's fucking mean, I have absolutely

145
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,920
no idea how to categorize games, I mean you guys were literally telling me what, oh I've already

146
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:43,240
forgotten the name, the type roguelike and roguelike are like two different things, it's a tycoon

147
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:50,920
a management sim, okay, okay, yeah, for some reason I need to do like a video essay on

00:17:50,920 --> 00:18:01,160
categorizations of gaming's because I'm just absolutely awful, gamer slob sex vealer is the

149
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,720
only way to pheromone max taken out, this is literally a game of you running a virtual version of

150
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:15,480
Exactly, is this game about us? Okay, now I remember when this game had a choke

151
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:22,040
haul on everyone, choke hold on everyone, but I never played it because I was very young when

152
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:28,360
it came out and I was still at the mercy of like asking my mum to buy me games, smile, because steam

153
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:35,960
games and I never really had the money for it and just call it drinking, eat me, I'm in

154
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:44,360
the strong need to put me in a choke hold on, honeycam falls under the sim, simulation

I'm sorry, Emmy has really nice feet, I don't care what anyone says,

196
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:55,480

00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,760
My god, sorry this game seems so polished

223
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,960

239
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,240
Yeah

240
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,960
Yes

241
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,160
Okay

242
00:28:53,800 --> 00:29:00,840
Oh my gosh, this is so good. Sorry. I must say this this game is good. This is polished

243
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,600
Okay

244
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,760
An accessory

245
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,360
Cash flow from operations. Don't worry. This is the only in the game. Okay

246
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,240
What is that wage? What's she talking about?

247
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,600
Right. Wait, hold on. I'm just gonna do this right now

248
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,520
I think everything's like good volume levels now

249
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
I'll just leave it like that

250
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,000
I mean, there's no reason to make a bad game only

251
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,400
That sounded a bit better a bit less intense on the music

252
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
Um

253
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:58,600
Honey knows how to make games have they made anything recently? I was aware of what honey pop is but this game. I'm loving it

254
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Okay

255
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
Yes

256
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,880
Okay

257
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,520
Oh, I love this

258
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,080
Uh-huh

259
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,840
The higher her style level is the more fans she will attract right kiana's back will hire kiana

260
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,800
But higher talent and style levels do come at a cost and she will usually demand a higher

261
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:33,960
A kiana retry and she said I need a pay for this wien. Okay. Both the honey pop one and two were well put together

262
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,440
I wonder if they're doing anything new

263
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,720
To take her on board before you go off hiring a total babe

264
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
A total babe

265
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,920
You can hover over the music note and little bow icon little bow icon

266
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,600
This fan count here is how many of our existing fans would be interested in her based on her fetishes

267
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,760
Okay, so we've got latina and

268
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,400
We're gonna recruit because she never drinks or smokes, which is really good

269
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,200
But these both frequent smokers

270
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,560
Although she's very good though

271
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,280
No, I

272
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,840
Sweet

273
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:21,480
I'll do my best. Uh, right. Should we work on getting what fans like this?

274
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,480
I feel like it's like more worth it to get fans

275
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,160
And then send them off

276
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,760
Are we doing speedrun tactics? Right now we're gonna do show

277
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,840
Oh

278
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,080
I don't uh, I need more money

279
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,520
Am I doing correct? I don't know if I'm doing correct right now. I have no idea

280
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,560
Uh, right. What is in this? Oh, we can have a third girl already

281
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,640
Receive two plus cash each time you collect from this. Sure

282
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:07,000
Automation all locations will all collect resources once every 15 minutes

283
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,520
Ads are I've not got ads unlocked yet

284
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,280
It says promo but it's like hidden out imagine if I just recruited all the girls from the first game

285
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,160
Why is the building wobbling right now? What is this?

286
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,080
Hardware camera quality up web server streaming quality up

287
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:26,040
Receive two plus fans each time you collect from the photo studio or that might be a big kind of boost

288
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Buildings can have three girls at once

289
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,240
Uh, right. We are gonna send you to get me someone

290
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,800
And then we're gonna put her in there

291
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,600
And collect more money

292
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,080
How do they relax though, I have no idea

293
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Right, we're getting a new girl

294
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,680
Oh

295
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,880
Sarah a guy who oh my god, it's sugar

296
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,840
Uh, frequently smokes and drink. See the she says never on both

297
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,560
I'm tempted. Nikki is a shy nerd girl who started out streaming video games

298
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,240
But quickly realized how much more money she could make by showing off the kids

299
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,040
Zoe's an insufferable millennial who tries a little too hard to be unique. She

300
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,280
Mm-hmm as

301
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,400
Wait

302
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:26,520
They unironically did the helip. What's that helicopter Apache meme

303
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,720
Sarah is an unbearable weeaboo who thinks she's Japanese and calls herself suki

304
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:37,320
She's the worst, but they're still kind of hot and weird. That is hilarious. This game is insane

305
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,880
That is hull

306
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,680
No

307
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,920
We have a few girls. It's time to think about training

308
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,720
Being naked on the internet isn't as easy as it sounds you gotta put some effort into that shit

309
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,440
If you drop a girl off your strip club, she can dance to earn talent point

310
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:03,000
Okay, and if you bring a girl over here to the fashion boutique, she'll earn style points by shopping

311
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,760
Okay

312
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,960
Her talent or style level will go up respectively

313
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:17,080
Just remember the higher a girl's talent and style level are the higher her hourly rate will be uh-huh

314
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:26,120
Okay, hold on all locations all collect let's do that receive test. I'm not sure about

315
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,720
Uh

316
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,080
So do we just I don't know what the carry item is. I don't even know where to get an item

317
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,280
We'll do give it a shot

318
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,600
Uh

319
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,520
I'm just farming

320
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,800
I'm not sure how to do this

321
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,320
Is this this is about modeling. Hey, yes 100 right 21st style point

322
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,920
Uh

323
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,240
Yes

324
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,320
I love that

325
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400
Okay

326
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,000
I'm loving this right what's going on here

327
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,360
Three plus cash when you collect carry an action. Let's do the item thing

328
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,720
Because it told me to do the item thing

329
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,360
Remember to check how you need to pay them before midnight midnight. Oops me who just spent my Steve

330
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,840
No, this is

331
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,240
Okay, okay, okay

332
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,880
Is that what I think is

333
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,400
No way it's got sugar

334
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:41,000
They really said we've got a Colombian and they gave us the sugar

335
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,920
All activities will be done twice as fast I mean shit

336
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,280
Okay, let's get some money

337
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,480
Money money money

338
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,640
I don't know how to

339
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,680
All right, hold on

340
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,920
Right go go go. Sure. Why not?

341
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,840
Uh, yeah

342
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,560
Oh, whoa, we just made the money

343
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:29,320
Right, what do we need to do next? It elapsed two minutes each time you click to rush an activity

344
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,560
Elapsed two minutes. It's like good or bad. All occasions will all collect in just a minute

345
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,560
Receive talent

346
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,920

347
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:49,880
Receive community each time you click. I think this one's the best one to go next camera quality up fans earned from increase

348
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:57,000
Okay, that's good and that's good. So what 150 to get community hardware and web servers and then think we'll start doing staffing again

349
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
Clicking dreams of time

350
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,040
How'd I do and I completely forgot what I was supposed to do

Yeah, yeah, I love that. Yeah. Yeah, right everyone make money make money

352
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,440

Okay, she's not making me a lot of money. I'm gonna have to send her

354
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,720

To make money, but I'm doing terrible job. Right. We've got 50. So let's invest in money

When we hire the next girl we will add it to whoever's needs to smoke

394
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,680

460
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,840
Session if you will

461
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,800
Right, what's the next upgrade so receive five plus cash

462
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,040
Oh, these are 500 though

463
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:59,960
I mean it implies that this one productivity and accounting are that you are in debt. You still need to pay them to drive

464
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:10,280
Okay, okay, I'm working on it. I'm working on it. How do I get more smokes? She's just going to singy

465
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,600
Okay

466
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:21,480
I am trying so hard level. Okay, so it puts them up

467
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,440
52 cash though

468
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,400
Oh every time she pops in

469
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:38,600
Yeah, that other one does not really make me much money. I wish I had displayed their names. What's your name?

470
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,840
What's your name? Nikki Nikki with the blue hair

471
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,880
Tiffany is free. I may send her to get a new item

472
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:56,040
Because the girls that don't get stressed don't actually have any bonus items on them

473
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,520
Not too bad. Nikki's too stressed out. That's okay. You're allowed to be stressed

474
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,320
Nikki's gonna need your pops and

475
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,040
He's a cake

476
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,600
Uh, Keanu's too stressed out as well

477
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Oh

478
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I am gonna try and

479
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:21,720
Just max out money because we're about to have to pay at midnight. We're at 8 30. So I'm playing it safe

480
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,400
We will just do the midnight thing

481
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,960
Sure, I'm just gonna go all out of money for her

482
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,680
Almost yeah, because there's currently unless we speed this up a bit

483
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,640
Oh, and I can get them back and then there can be more than one

484
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,760
Oh, please get to work minus theory again

485
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,440
Fans earned from a photo shoot increase

486
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,440
Wait, these are all full shit related

487
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:06,120
Should I just do nicotine patch? No

488
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,800
Uh

489
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:22,440
Sure, let's get this one for no particular reason at all. Hey, Tiffany for no particular reason at all. Here you go

490
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,080
Oh

491
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,080
Wow

492
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:31,400
Oh, Nikki just does not make me any money. She really doesn't

493
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:38,520
We're at maximum capacity. Oh god, this game's harder than I thought. Am I gonna lose?

494
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,640
For no particular reason, right? Let's just get her more fans then

495
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,800
Are you gonna be stressed out?

496
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,200
Uh, I feel like yeah, but

497
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:57,560
What do I kind of want to get the one we're more oh, it's 500 bucks right do 100 bucks investment

498
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,360
as soon as we can

499
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,360
because we're struggling

500
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:10,360
Nikki you are not going to be doing shows you do not make the same kind of money maximum capacity wait wait until she gets out

501
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,400
You go make fans you do that

502
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,760
This is getting rough

503
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,720
Right 100 bucks. We're almost there

504
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,920
I hope the rest of the girls are not watching this right now

505
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:29,560
Me and August like that's it. Everyone do this do this. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out

506
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,520
Uh good, can you like

507
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:42,280
Get slightly better at anything. I don't mean to be nasty. Nikki, but you are struggling right now

508
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,720
To do anything

509
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,720
Okay, we've got 100 bucks

510
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,760
Accounting receive extra cash

511
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:59,240
That's two minutes when we rush. So we're gonna do that one next because apparently we're like rushing through the entire day by accident

512
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:06,360
57 cash, okay, that's good. You can go get a new item to give to the girls

513
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,880
Oh wait, I accidentally put

514
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,280
The boutique all right

515
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,360
I'm not a girl, but I will get out

516
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,720
Strongly working everyone to the bone. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Am I supposed to manage their stress?

517
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,720
I assume I could just put them all in at the same time

518
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,520
All right, we'll put her to rest

519
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,920
Nikki's now level two

520
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,800
Oh, you're too stressed. That's fine

521
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,840
Uh

522
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,920
You're going straight back in misses 57

523
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,360
Although we can get another girl if we really want us

524
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Receive

525
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,480
Streaming quality, uh-huh girls can carry two items. Yes

526
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,520
That's very good because you need a nicotine patch

527
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,160
Yes

528
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,400
Yes, that's what I wanted to do right

529
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:21,000
Okay, they're both relaxing so I'll skip time on them relaxing because we need to farm money like no

530
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:33,160
Do we prepare for a new person coming in with nicotine patch and stuff I think we do

531
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:44,200
I think we just prepare for a new girl coming in with the smoking and drink situation

532
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,560
You're gonna have to go make some cash because you're doing terrible

533
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,120
Strongly now needs a purple coat

534
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,000
I walk with like a pimp. Was it a walk like a

535
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,960
a real og

536
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:05,720
I don't know what I'm doing. Can you guys make some money? Oh my gosh, please make some money. I am dying

537
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,920
No sweat. We're about to go in the red again

538
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:14,280
Why am I so bad? I think they need to get more fans, maybe

539
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,680
Maybe

540
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:23,480
Yeah, sure you did fine. Oh, we are not gonna make the payroll

541
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,600
335 bucks

542
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,240
I don't know if we can invest in another girl

543
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,240
Oh

544
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:41,400
My gosh, wait, why is this game so hard? I'm doing something wrong. There's something I'm not picking up on

545
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:46,120
What am I not picking up on earning an extra 10 bucks? That's fine

546
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:52,040
Stream call a cash earned by 500. Right. Is that what we're going for?

547
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,040
Uh

548
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,160
Needs more

549
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:04,360
Overlap every time you send them to the adult store their price goes stop. Is that real?

550
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:09,640
Ico is expensive time to time is going by too fast as well

551
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,320
Should we do the 100 bucks then?

552
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,720
This is hard

553
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,560
I'm trying

554
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,560
right, let's do

555
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,720
Well, she's about to finish right go again

556
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,040
Oh

557
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:32,520
Yes, go right. She makes 500. Why do you make 57 bucks?

558
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,240
Because you've got talent times two

559
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,520
But then that puts her base price up. I need to give everyone the piggy bank

560
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,440
I'll do it

561
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:47,000
The price depends on style and talent not many have I think training the girls is more important than money

562
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,960
Think about how well we are allowed to if the girls had zero experience

563
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,920
Honestly

564
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,640
If I 15 fans

565
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,080
But there's no overlap

566
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,200
Uh maxipum capacity

567
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I don't know

568
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,840
Does shove everyone into the bit club

569
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:20,120
I'm trying to get more fans in the categories with that other girl and then if we hire someone

570
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:26,840
That has like same fan base that would probably help out a lot

571
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:35,240
She's already pretty talented, I don't know. I'm probably gonna regret putting her in there, but

572
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,200
I

573
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,440
Know you you have hardly the output

574
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:52,040
God they're inside the studio for so long. I'm definitely missing something 57 cash

575
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,520
I cause less than 30 fans does she? Oh

576
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:03,720
If we're still in the red by midnight, it's over getting them trained is pretty important

577
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,120
Is it fans are getting them trained like this?

578
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,360
I don't know

579
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,720
I'm trying

580
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,840
Okay, listen

581
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,760
Sure, if you say so right 200 fans

582
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:28,040
I thought this was gonna be a chill game because literally I looked I was gonna play idol manager

583
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,720
She is she gonna end up making the most money

584
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:37,160
I was gonna end up playing idol manager, but you guys were like that game's actually super duper hard. Don't do that

585
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,240
So I've not done it

586
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,400
I feel like I'm doing something terribly wrong

587
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,000
Girls can carry a third item for 2.5

588
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:55,320
We'll do the elapsed time one against my better judgment, but she's about to be stressed out

589
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,440
It's too expensive for your current setup

590
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,840
Well, I guess you're just gonna get more fans

591
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,320
Okay, so Ico hardly has any fans

592
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,280
So

593
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,280
Do you want to go get some?

594
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,080
Okay, we made it to 100 bucks. So we're gonna invest. I know we're gonna go in the red

595
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,720
but

596
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,800
I'm needing help

597
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,840
With this zoom in thing. I need the time to go slower

598
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,080
Should have gone for she was way cheaper

599
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:43,480
She makes 52 cash now, okay, it is I need to send them into

600
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,440
The thing need to get more fans. That's fine. I can deal with that

601
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,320
Yes, go get more fans

602
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,720
Everyone go get more fans. We're trying we're trying out here. Okay

603
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,920
I know we're gonna go into the negative. We were scaling too early

604
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:05,160
Okay, everyone go get fans go get more fans go

605
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,320
Okay, you're too stressed out. That's fine

606
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,720
And then everyone's getting sent away to make money

607
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,800
Come on come on come on come on

608
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,200
All right, go make money. Okay. She makes 164 now

609
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,880
That was the problem. We needed fans. Okay

610
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,440
That was the problem. I didn't optimize

611
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,880
You're too stressed out. That's perfectly fine

612
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:40,200
Okay, everyone's getting sent to this little photo shoot everyone's getting sent to the photo shoot

613
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:45,880
I'm learning we're getting there into the content mates. Everyone do a publicity stunt right now

614
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,760
purposely get banned go on a two-day

615
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:57,080
Suspension and then come back and then everyone will go nuts for you. Okay, everyone do something out wildly against to us

616
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,080
But not to against to us

617
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,480
I don't make myself clear

618
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:07,720
Okay, I think I made myself clear everyone get fans. Okay, you hardly get fans when I send you away though

619
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,960
Oh my god a hundred and are you too stressed? Okay, that's understandable. Have a nice day

620
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,640
Oh my god. Okay. We're learning. We're learning

621
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,920
Right you make 81 sure get me 81 the now

622
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,720
Something yeah, someone do something controversial. That's it. Do what damper did get that

623
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:40,520
Okay, okay, okay, I'm listening to make it easy for you. I put together the promo section, you know the drill

624
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,920
Open up that window for me

625

This is a list of all the sites. Oh, we can just straight up buy fans. Okay

626
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,480
Bedsitter's bed post. Okay, you're done

Soriety secrets hot chocolate love stop

628
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:06,040
Each site caters to a specific fetish. So all the new fans gain from that is hilarious. Oh, that's so good

629
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,800
Two so we don't have to wait around for fans to trickle in

630
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:18,840
This is so good for my way. If you invest in advertising, we'll have more promo opportunities every day. Okay

631
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,760
Okay, I

632
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,760

633
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,320
I'm comprehending right everyone go make money the now

634
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,120
Because we're gonna buy promo

635
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:35,480
Yes, we're gonna buy promo if it's free and I don't have to send them. Is this dealer? It absolutely is

636
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:41,400
I'm trying so hard to hit all the categories. Okay. We've got lollipop on the go. We've got penta

637
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,240
We've got

638
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:50,280
Chocolate right you do 81. Sure. Why not?

639
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,000

640
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,400
We have we've got another one for

641
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,240
Teen

642
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,040
Okay

643
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,920
Okay, okay, okay. I'm learning. I'm learning right go get more fans

644
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:12,520
Right promo. No, wait. I've still not made the money. Wait, hold on. Hold on

645
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:19,800
Okay, I'm starting to slightly get it right. We don't have any fetish for hot chocolate lover

646
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,480
Do we have the girls that cater to those? Yes, Tiffany is a

647
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Oh, she's also banal

648
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:36,520
Okay, I'm learning I'm learning

649
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,400
We're at 45 bucks though

650
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,640
Ha we're at 45 bucks already

651
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:53,000
Hmm should I go all out on money at the moment?

652
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:58,840
What would be the next one 250 receive 10 plus cash

653
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:07,400
Four ads will be available. Sure. I'll put it into ad space because if it gets me if it skips the part where they have to go

654
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,880
Oh, you're too stressed. Sorry

655
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,360
If it's oh my god, she makes 180 though

656
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,040
Okay, I think we'll go all out on buying ads

657
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:23,480
And just try and get the money we are going to go into the negative but that's okay

658
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:33,320
We working on it there we go what we're looking at negative. Oh see only negative 79 today. Okay. Okay. We're getting there

659
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,560
What does promo look like today?

660
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,120
uh big booty

661
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:41,800
And glasses are the only two that we can utilize right now

662
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,920
So we have our objective

663
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,920
Done with that

664
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,120
Okay, let's invest like that

665
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,280
Glasses yes, we have two with glasses actually

666
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,320
Okay, okay

667
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,600
so

668
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,600
glasses and that one

669
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,480
And that's all we can do today

670
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,720
For investment wise that way

671
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,840
Sure, we'll get some fancy

672
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:17,000
Easy peasy, huh? Oh you're too stressed out. Sorry. Sorry

673
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:22,120
Oh, we are like you doing it. I will take your whole stock of ico

674
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:27,720
We might need to invest in the chub and chocolate for the new gen moment. Okay. Okay. I hear you. I hear you

675
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,720
Uh, we could maybe do

676
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,600
You're too stressed out. That's fine. You're allowed to be stressed out

677
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:42,680
What are we looking at for all locations will all click? No, it's fine. Um

678
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,440
500

679
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:51,160
Cash earned is increased by 50 percent. Okay, we're gonna go all out on that for now

680
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:54,040
I think that's the best idea at this point in time

681
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
But we are starting to get a lovely

682
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,320
Gross

683
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:07,160
We are starting to do it. It looks like advertisements are way to go but we will invest in a

684
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:12,200
Okay, let's hurry up with the spaddy so someone else can get put in as well

685
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,760
And

686
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,960
And then

687
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:27,160
For making money it's fans modified by their talent value time to make them go into the club

688
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,320
Okay, they have multipliers

689
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,280
Mmm

690
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:40,040
Nice capacity. I'm just telling her like continually get more fans

691
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:45,800
Because she's upgrading glasses, which I assume cascades on Ico

692
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,440
I don't really tell her to stream that much

693
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:59,640
We'll try it. We'll try it. We'll try it. It is going to put up our base price for the girls, but they are doing pretty good right now

694
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,640
Okay, there we go

695
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,640
investment go down

696
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,440
by the cam

697
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,400
Community you receive three plus

698
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:21,880
What next is the game maybe accounting is next and then capacity and then I will get a new girl because we're at the point

699
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,880
Where not everyone is fitting inside

700
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,480
Sure, why not?

701
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:32,920
200 bucks 200 bucks two nine seven

702
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,760
Two two eight nine you should get more toys

703
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,480
You would say that wouldn't be a little refling

704
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:46,520
Oh, we are starting to cascade what Ico though. We're at 300 bucks already. Is there anything we can get?

705
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:54,760
We can all right, okay, okay, we're doing it. We're doing it. We're doing it. We're doing it. We're getting there

706
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:58,040
It just took me a hot second. Okay

707
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,920
I'm just very dumb

708
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:06,360
Now I'm gonna put something on nicky because we keep pushing her

709
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:12,680
I don't know how little or

710
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:16,840
How much we're gonna go under for debt for the payroll, but we're trying

711
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,720
That's the main thing

712
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:26,920
Are we even gonna go into debt today 700 wait why 700s?

713
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,400
Why 700

714
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,440
Why 700

715
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:45,960
If the girls get those fans has a high talent she'd get more for Ico

716
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:50,440
Yeah, I was gonna put something on nicky because nicky's getting glasses

717
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,240
For her right now, which is really good

718
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,160
Oh my god, this really is a strategy game

719
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:00,280
I thought it was gonna be the easy peasy strategy, but nah, they're going for it

720
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:06,040
I'll see if I can get a comp. Oh, you're too stressed. That's fine. You're allowed to be stressed. Right. No, not nicotine

721
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:11,800
Girls habits improve. She'll only demand half as much pay. Uh, that's really funny

722
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
No

723
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,480
All these are temporary

724
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:23,880
The piggy bank seems all right though

725
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,880
Oh

726
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,120
Right hold on books

727
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,960
Kiana's actually charging a wee bit

728
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,160
You can calm down here and that's what's up

729
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,920
Wait, hold on. Is it girls?

730
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,160
How do I put a piggy bank on you?

731
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,800
I've already forgotten how to put the piggy bank on hold on

732
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:50,040
You calm down. Thanks. Stop charging me so much. I know Ico doesn't have a free slot yet

733
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,560
As well as subscriber pillow. Did they get paid while relaxing? What a kind card

734
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:00,200
Every ever they stream cost you and you're running some of those girls into the ground

735
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,920
Oh, she makes 194. Does she make more than the other girl?

736
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,800
I guess because she's making all the fans in her

737
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,840
Category

738
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,960
Oh, she only makes 140 now. She's the weak link

739
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,440
I

740
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:27,880
Don't want to level her up. You know what go and get another toy

741
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,520
What's in my inventory I forgot

742
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:39,400
Keep forgetting right actually already have a wine box and nicotine patch if I wanted someone new

743
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,520
I think I need piggy bank for Ico

744
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I think I need piggy bank for Ico

745
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:52,360
Wow, that's rough. Ico is killing us right now

746
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:57,800
If I can get a piggy bank, I'll have to invest in

747
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,480
Oh, there's actually a few things we could invest in here

748
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,640
We don't have the others yet

749
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,080
2.5 for a third item

750
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,960
Ouch

751
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,960
You are the weakest link goodbye

752
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,040
Yeah, because she isn't leveling up

753
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,160
I know but if I level them up they cost even more per hour

754
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:25,320
That's currently the problem I'm facing

755
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,320
1.9

756
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,440
I don't want to level them up, but I think I'm gonna have to

757
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,280
Go get some more fans while you're at it

758
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,120
302 cash though

759
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,480
I like the little heels sound

760
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:02,760
Yeah, she's gone up to 14 you're too stressed. That's fine. That's fine. Everyone's too stressed. Everyone's allowed to be stressed. Okay

761
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,160
Orange stale while shopping in half the time

762
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:12,600
Sorry, but it's just cat ears. I don't think cat ears are very I don't think that counts

763
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,560
um

764
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,280
Well, we've not done that on someone so

765
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,640
Who's getting in uh

766
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,360
sports

767
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,360
I'll just shovel on here. Okay

768
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,080
Ah

769
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,800
That maybe wasn't the best idea but hey ho

770
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:36,840
Can you switch items? Yes, I assume so

771
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:42,600
Okay, she's just gone out to 194. So do we farm fans again?

772
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:48,120
All right, we don't have that invest what five girls all locations

773
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,800
I think four girls in a building and then we'll do the staff one

774
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:56,840
I say that as if I'm not running us into the ground right now. Go get more fans

775
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,040
Or maybe I should I should invest in the more fans thing

776
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,760
I don't know what to do

777
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:13,000
I'll invest in the more fans thing it will put us in debt, which is fine

778
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
But

779
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,960
Um

780
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:26,680
Imagine if we just hoarded piggy banks and gave them all to the girls. I'm needing to shove one on ickel

781
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:28,680
But I'm like hardly getting the cash

782
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,160
Kiana's stress free but where am I she only makes four

783
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:39,240
It's six new things right. I know this is bad, but if we get more fans

784
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:42,840
It'll be worth more and yes, I know we're about to go into insane debt

785
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,960
But that's my choice to be a dumb dumb and puts on debt again

786
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,720
How much in the negative? Okay 200

787
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:53,640
That's not bad. We took down 200 in the payroll

788
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,280
From that piggy bank manoeuvre

789
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:01,000
A little bit. How much are you owing? I all pair day

790
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,760
Oh, it doesn't really say per day

791
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,760
Ha ha ha

792
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:18,120
You're too stressed out. That's okay. That's just very terrible timing

793
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:24,760
Good we're getting 200 per show. That's good

794
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:31,480
Uh, you're getting close to 200 per show which again, it's good

795
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,160
What how much do you get per show though?

796
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,720
300 per show don't mind if I do

797
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,480
Don't mind if I do

798
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:53,800
Sure, uh, we don't have fit do we?

799
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,320
No

800
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:05,400
Oh, we do have fit okay promo fit go right Tiffany should have more fans

801
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,440
Depends on their work hours

802
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:21,400
No, no one will be getting a sign-on bonus until they've done their work. Did I make myself clear?

803
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:27,320
I think I'll go pick up another item because some of the girls don't hold anything

804
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,880
Probably gonna regret it, but go

805
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,960
One two five she makes more than the others

806
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:42,280
Right are your weakest link. Yeah, you are right go get us a new item

807
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:47,000
And then Tiffany you hurry up so we can put you on the site. Okay

808
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:50,760
Go. Okay. Yeah, she makes way more

809
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,560
Okay, okay, we're keen to get in there

810
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:01,560
I'm like did I just hoard money so I can put three items on the girls

811
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:05,720
Ico has the stream to make up the cost. See if I can get piggy bank

812
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,520
It's getting thrown on to Ico because she is just

813
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,120
stupendously

814
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:15,160
I recommend putting them to work 24 hours per day because every moment they're not working is useless stop

815
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,440
I wish I could make a joke right now, but that's hilarious

816
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,200
I'll let you cook again

817
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:28,680
You did fantastic. You're too stressed out though, which is fine. Um

818
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:39,080
Receive 20 plus cash each time you collect from the studio. There can be four girls in a building. I'm wondering if that's the best thing to do

819
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:50,040
Hold on let me cook but in a bad way

820
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,800
I'm gonna invest do that one

821
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,240
Oh wait, that didn't help

822
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:09,240
Hold on hold on piggy bank. Yes. Okay. We're gonna go all out. We're gonna go all out on

823
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:16,680
Getting the third item we give that to Ico then we're laughing to the bank because she just cost so much at this point in time

824
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:21,480
So that's done. Yeah, but we're getting 300 cash for what she does. Okay. We're going all out

825
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:27,640
We're going all out promo. We don't have these yet. So there's not really a point just yet and doing it

826
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,280
But we are going to try and get 2.5

827
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:35,080
thousand dollars

828
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:42,680
I'm enjoying this game so far. Sorry. I like it. I like these kind of funny asking right. What is the negative we're putting?

829
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:50,280
We can recover. Okay. We can rebuild. I repeat we can rebuild. What is promo today?

830
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:59,800
I think we have a flat chest. Who's flat Ico? No, you're not

831
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,040
We don't have a flat chest

832
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,560
But we do have a piggy bank so

833
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,040
We can do the s word

834
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,560
Hmm

835
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,720
You're too stressed out. Of course you're too stressed out

836
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:32,280
Okay, okay, we're going all out. We're gonna get this third item. We're gonna give it to Ico so she can stop draining our supply

837
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:39,960
Bad luck on ads today. Yes. I'm just gonna go all out on money. I'm gonna save every penny. I think we can do it

838
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:45,560
I think we can do it as soon as Ico gets that piggy bank. We're laughing because it hardly cost us a runner then

839
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,800
Come on

840
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:55,000
Come on. Why are these shows taking so long?

841
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:02,280
I feel like you'd be done after the two-hour mark. I'd be like, oh, I'm exhausted. Come on. Wrap it up everyone. Wrap it up

842
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:08,600
Give it a shot. Oh, we got a thousand right. We're at a thousand. We just need to do that again a week

843
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,600
Oh, you're too stressed out. Of course you are

844
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,840
Too stressed out right go make some money

845
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:21,400
Right. Well, we need a thousand more dollars and we're done and we're not at noon yet. So I think we can do it

846
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,640
Come on everyone wait hurry up and relax

847
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:32,280
Mm-hmm says the endurance streamer. Yeah, they must be rappers

848
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:40,040
Are they streamed for 12 hours a day? Okay, I'd be exhausted. I don't know how these girls aren't stressed out the wazoo

849
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,080
Okay, go again go again

850
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:49,800
You can do it right. Hurry up. Hurry up and finish. Yes. Go make some fans

851
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,480
And then go make 300 bucks go

852
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:57,960
Go go go make cash make cash. We need 500 more

853
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,400
Come on. We need 500 more

854
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,680
You would be exhausted

855
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:06,840
Where are you?

856
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:09,720
But there's something to do with some of the de-stressor options being

857
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,520
and

858
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:17,320
They must be yapers. Yeah, they probably yap for like three hours and like right. Let's get down to business

859
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,200
Oh, come on. We're so close to getting that upgrade

860
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:29,160
Yes, we're almost there. Come on

861
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,040
Go go go

862
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:43,160
Right, we did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I know this is against what I want, but

863
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,320
there

864
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,680
We've got enough

865
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,880
I would not we're really just shy. It's fine though. It's fine

866
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:55,640
Right piggy bank time piggy bank time for real for real god. That was 800. Are you fucking serious?

867
01:18:55,720 --> 01:19:02,680
Aiko you cost so much you cost so much money. Aiko you are running us into the ground. Do I make myself clear?

868
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,840
So is she be streamed? Hey

869
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,040
Come on. Her yap is the best though

870
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:15,960
I want to go get cool. You did fantastic, but you're too stressed rubbish

871
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:25,000
She makes 300 now. Yeah, definitely need to get them more fans. That's how we're getting like any money

872
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:32,280
Right one more batch at the camp studio and then

873
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:38,040
Then we can upgrade to three items. Aiko gets the piggy bank. We can invest in another girl

874
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:41,800
We can start investing in the promos as well. What are we looking at to do?

875
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:45,880
Decent the cost are pretty penny though

876
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,680
You keep working the girls to death and everyone but Aiko makes like 75 cents a fan at best. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay

877
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:57,800
Let me cook though. Let me cook slowly. Aiko high quality high cost. Yes

878
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,880
Yes, go make money

879
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Okay invest

880
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,160
item books, okay

881
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:09,640
you

882
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,880
Stop charging me a ridiculous amount of money

883
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:20,520
We should just get 18 fans. That's six hours or I can just get money

884
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,720
You're too stressed out. You're allowed to be stressed out

885
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,320
Go make money

886
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:34,600
Right, so can I now get a fifth girl? I can and four girls to our building

887
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,760
And aesthetics

888
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:44,360
Training and aesthetics don't do anything

889
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:53,960
Building and then we'll get new staff about that and then I'll start sending them to the shops to get

890
01:20:56,200 --> 01:21:00,040
Items to get more fans in certain categories wink wink

891
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:07,560
They took way too long to pick that now her corpus isn't gonna be in debt so it was something

892
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:14,920
Okay, I can do it. I know what I'm doing wink wink. I do not know what I'm doing

893
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:19,560
Yes, you're too stressed out. You're allowed to be it's okay

894
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:29,560
Go make some more fans. I think is oh someone needs to go right go recruit someone

895
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,840
And then we'll invest in some

896
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:42,040
We've got stuff for that so go invest in that I guess

897
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,600
Invest in a staff spot

898
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:54,120
All locations will all collect I don't really these kind of seem a bit arbitrary like we don't need it

899
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,160
5,000 a thousand

900
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:00,280
Maybe a thousand in product abuse seems best now

901
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:06,920
Second talent really makes 75 cent training correction is needed

902
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,080
I'm trying I'm trying

903
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:21,240
Oh Nikki has a huge tag. Sorry I keep forgetting

904
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,840
She makes 300 now

905
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,240
I

906
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,160
Don't know if I'm gonna regret that I probably am

907
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:44,760
Let's get the new girl in I don't know what the result is gonna be but let's get the new girl in

908
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:54,760
Nadia frequently well, it doesn't matter what they do to de-stress

909
01:22:55,720 --> 01:23:00,280
Sira gets fans though fan count 178

910
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:06,520
And we do have some crossover with this one, I think sira

911
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:11,640
Sira's an unbearable weeaboo. I think it's sira that wins. Look at the fan count that she comes with

912
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,840
And we already have the stuff to put on her

913
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,040
uh Nadia

914
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:20,680
Is a self-described

915
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:23,960
Russian goddess who used to provide sadistic

916
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:28,040
Okay, I remember Lidalia

917
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:35,640
Erin's one cash for each fan she has and she has 66

918
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:41,800
But if I level up sira, I want to say sira. What was that noise?

919
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:46,760
Uh-huh

920
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,200
Okay

921
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,400
Um

922
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:19,800
The premium pass but it only takes an hour what's the downside

923
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,760
Nasty dudes are walking around with

924
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:31,560
What's like without a little risk though am I right? They can get

925
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:36,360
You know what they can get a few dudes

926
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:42,680
Okay, we're gonna level her up go make some money at the moment

927
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:46,840
And

928
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,920
Okay

929
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:54,200
Oh my gosh, not real

930
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:02,040
Oh, she really is a weeb completely right go get some more fans I guess

931
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:09,080
Oh my gosh, okay. I need to put nicotine

932
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:14,200
She really goes arigato. Oh

933
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
It's a bit cringe for me hen. I have to admit

934
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:21,080
Ken is now level two talent goods. I'm glad

935
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,080
It goes well

936
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,120
Okay, there we go, but she costs more

937
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:32,840
All right, what are we looking at today?

938
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:39,000
That'll be worth it. That's worth it. That's worth the that is worth it as well. Actually

939
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:41,080
I think we'll do a full investment from

940
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:44,440
Need her for gen two right now

941
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:50,360
I don't know. I saw shebe's tweet on her all if you didn't see it. Don't worry. Um

942
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:56,440
But she doesn't she's unsure what she wants her

943
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,160
Finalized, um

944
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:07,080
Her 2.0 idea to be

945
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:15,880
All right, let's get some promo first because from promo is just more fans, which is good. So that's exactly what we're

946
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
wanting

947
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:25,640
Cheeky bit. Oh, I've just closed off the game. Oh, I almost just ruined that run there because I don't know if it auto saves or not

948
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:33,880
Okay, let's get right into it. We'll do the promo for it. Wait. Actually, we might be able to do it now

949
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:38,520
chubby Asian glasses and then that other word wink wink

950
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:47,000
Okay, and then we'll do investments. It all saves each day. Thank goodness because I accidentally clicked also

951
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:49,640
That could have gone terribly wrong

952
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,720
Okay

953
01:26:54,040 --> 01:27:02,360
You want 300 you're too stressed out, which is perfectly fine. Don't worry about it. You get 300 that's perfectly fine

954
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:05,320

I don't want another girl at this point in time

958
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:17,240
Um elapsed three minutes each time you click

959
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:21,320
So what all locations no, that's rubbish

960
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:30,600
It might be hardware or advertisement each fan. Okay. Hmm. That might be worth the you get a receive five fans each time you collect

961
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:32,680
Wait, no, that's rubbish

962
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:35,340
It's web servers hardware advertising

963
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:39,560
Capacity is five grand

964
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:45,480
Up to six girls can be employed at once

965
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:53,400
It's either five grand for web servers hardware advertising is 1.5 and maybe advertising

966
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,640
It's the way to do it productivity is important. Am I be am I misunderstanding?

967
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:04,840
Hmm elapsed three minutes each time you click to rush an activity

968
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:10,200
Yeah, I'm I'm gonna just take on what you guys say

969
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:15,960
I'm not gonna doubt for a second that you guys are completely correct in what's going on. Okay

970
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:19,400
Um

971
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:25,480
Because this is confusing. I'm sure there's real strats that I could have but I'm being very dumb

972
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:27,480
Um

973
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:30,760
Right if you're all done, can we get you more fans? Maybe

974
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:34,440
No, I'd rather everyone just work right now

975
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:37,720
You're too stressed out. That's fine

976
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:44,120
She really said completely. I love her. Sorry. What's your name again?

977
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,560

978
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:50,840
It's a boy. There's an a

979
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,520
How'd I do?

980
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:55,960
Uh, right everyone makes some motherhood cash, right?

981
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:59,480
Invest

982
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:02,200
Not six girls at the moment

983
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,920
Maybe that adds promo what we're looking at

984
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:13,160
I love this game. This is so good fame

985
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:16,680
I'm gonna send them to all pick up items now

986
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:20,120
We can invest in items in preparation for the next girl

987
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:25,320
And again, if I can get piggy banks on these girls, you know, we're laughing to the piggy bank

988
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,520
Okay, okay, I understand you didn't like it

989
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:39,160
But at least I tried, you know, right everyone's getting put to the shop except for her because she's got the best

01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,280
Just yeah, go get stuff at the shop, please

991
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:47,800
Bet that we would be your moneymaker nowadays

992
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:51,400
Probably right everyone go get items right now

993
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:58,520
Either we'll get stuff to prepare for a new girl coming in. I just want to make sure yeah, I have no items. Okay. That's fine. I have no items

994
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:05,320
Okay, let's hurry up these girls so they can pick up some items

995
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:10,600
Quick quick quick

996
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:15,000
That joke was a real porker right piggy bank get

997
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,880

01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:39,640
Again another piggy bank. Absolutely. Again. I'm not absolutely right. Who doesn't have a piggy bank. Yeah, you don't

1002
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:43,080
Tiffany and

1003
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:47,160
Nikki do not have a piggy bank. So let's just pop them on

1004
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:55,560
So everyone's now just gotten a bit cheaper. That's what we like to hear now. We are gonna go make some money

1005
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:01,960
I think I've just comprehended what the productivity bar is doing

1006
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,560

1010
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:18,120
Time to send them to the spa and swine and dine on this game. It's already halfway done. I think

1011
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:22,840
Tiffany's still level one. Is she actually what a legend

1012
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:26,840

You must be able to max out someone's level surely

1042
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,080
Surely that's how it works

1043
01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:02,120

Possibly

Who where is the room?

1072
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:16,840

It's a good idea to keep someone low skilled to just run errands. Okay. Okay

1082
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:11,960
Maybe messed up slightly but hey, that's me automation. Maybe worth the money now that there's multiple buildings going on

That's not what I thought it meant. I understand what that means now

She's out of the game, but Ren ain't gonna pay itself

1106
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:58,360
Lilian is a goth out brat who hangs out at the mall and does pretty much anything her parents disapprove of just annoying teen tattoos

1107
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:00,440
and you come

01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:02,520
So she smokes

She smokes so now she doesn't now she's half the price

1110
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:16,760

I'm gonna send you to get more fans

1112
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:26,120

01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:44,040
We don't have anyone that does that we do have someone that does that

1117
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:51,080
Can I you're too stressed out? That's fine. You're allowed to be stressed. Okay

1118
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:56,040
All right, go get some more fans. I'm just gonna farm fans for around

1119
01:39:57,480 --> 01:40:01,240
We are making three thousand per go. Yeah, no

1120
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,500
What is it with the cake fans honestly?

1121
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:11,480
We can put any random item on Lilian at least because she doesn't drink at all

1122
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:18,360
A thousand

1123
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:24,360
Ike was fully maxed out. I guess we would just form fans. Give us a thousand because

1124
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:30,440
What we putting in Lilian? I mean if we're basing her after me

1125
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:46,920

1126
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:53,000

1130
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:26,600
One point four one point three. Okay. I think we've cracked the system. It just took me a hot second to understand

1131
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:32,120
It just took me an uno momento if you will one point four

1132
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:38,120
Okay, we did it we did it we did it we did it

1133
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:46,680
Uh promo we're not interested in that. I don't want a seventh girl just yet

1134
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:50,360
I would take

1135
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:56,520
Capacity for five K then five. Oh, maybe five K on web servers

1136
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:01,400
Ooh, that's a juicy number

1137
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:08,120
Mmm, Tiffany's too stressed out. You're allowed to be stressed out

1138
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:12,760
I think

1139
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:15,560
Oh, I don't know

1140
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:23,880
You know what I'm gonna do ads and then I'll do web servers, then I'll do capacity. How about that?

1141
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,720
Please kill me. Oh

1142
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:31,640
Are you okay darling? Why would you see such a thing?

1143
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:40,680
I guess I'll just send you on earth. Okay, if we're gonna get a new girl coming in

1144
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:44,360
We'll grab piggy bank in preparation of the new girl

1145
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:47,560
I'm

1146
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:49,800
One point five one

1147
01:42:53,000 --> 01:43:00,040
Higher a manager you already have six girls automation would be a time saver. Okay. Okay. What's automation?

1148
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:04,120
Productivity

1149
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:08,920
Accounting since the profits are so who usually take minutes to collect

1150
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:14,120
Lilene super edgy and honey pop to issue. She needs less stress take the plug on

1151
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:21,720
Right next to automation 500. Okay, we can do that easy peasy. Let me squeeze that's so quick

1152
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:25,560
That's so quick

1153
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:29,880
Come on, this is taking forever

1154
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:32,840
Oh

1155
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:39,640
If there's money inside you can time stomp it oops

1156
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:45,640
Is that gonna okay doing it in the background

1157
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:53,160
Uh maximum capacity go get more fans, I guess

1158
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:57,960
I'm not really sure what to do with her that much

1159
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:01,880
500 book each

1160
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:07,880
She gets a thousand I feel like she could probably get more sure she had more fans

1161
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:11,240
Next thing please

1162
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:13,320
She only makes 500

1163
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:26,920
Going some more fans right subscribe instantly earn 50 of the fans that would be earned from a photo shoot after performing

1164
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:29,640
Whoa, that seems OP

1165
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:46,520
That seems OP is but what have I got we need a nicotine patch and then we can get a new girl if we want

1166
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:51,160
It's OP. Okay, hold on

1167
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:54,040
We might be taken

1168
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:57,160
Hi, okay, hold on. Let's put on Nikki

1169
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:03,400
Okay, okay

1170
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:09,640
She's gonna get fans every time she streams that's fantastic. Oh my gosh. She is she's gonna gain fans in the background

1171
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:13,560
That's OP

1172
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:20,920
Right, we're gonna we've got 5000 so we'll upgrade the studio next so we get even more money

1173
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:27,640
It was a while since I've seen this game. I have no idea how old it is. I just remember everyone being like, oh my gosh

1174
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,440
Did you see the new game?

1175
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:33,400

1177
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:49,320
Okay promo no not promo. We'll do promo next actually. I just realized oh should we do capacity?

1178
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:54,520
We'll do capacity next but we'll do promo first if that makes sense

1179
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:58,040
Because it is just free fans

1180
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:05,000
Here we go, I think maybe just buy oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa that went up in price

1181
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:11,240
That went up in price

1182
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:13,960

That went up in price indeed I just send her to that

1184
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:25,160
That went up in price

1185
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:29,000
All right, we really need capacity before we get the seventh girl

1186
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,400
This game is eight years old. Yeah. Yeah

1187
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:39,880
1.7

1188
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:43,400
You're too stressed that's fine

1189
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:46,360
What do we do glasses?

1190
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:49,400
I'll take because nicky is going crazy

1191
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:53,560
That subscribe pillow is OP

1192
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:00,440
Oh, it's promo

2014 was a decade ago old man emoji. She makes 1.2 now

1198
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:27,320
Sure, we need to max out on the thing uh

1199
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:32,840
Nicotine, okay, we can get a new girl without any issues now half the price

1200
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:37,720
But we wouldn't even be able to yeah, that's what I didn't want

1201
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:41,400
At max capacity

1202
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
You're so real for that

1203
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:47,160
Please kill me

1204
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:56,760

1207
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:08,920

1208
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:11,560
next, okay

1209
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:17,160
Don't start talking about the ages of things the first strike came out in 2001

1210
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:20,040
Hey

1211
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:23,880
I thought it was fake that strike five thing. I think you guys were trolling me to be honest

1212
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:27,640
I was like, okay, you've got me. I believe do but I think it's actually real

1213
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:34,360
Hold up a minute. I think it's real anything else. Yes, please more money. Go just go

1214
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:42,680
She does not make as much

1215
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:44,760
just

1216
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:50,120
How about go recruit a girl and we'll get her when she's ready

1217
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
2.7

1218
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:56,600
Yeah

1219
01:48:56,920 --> 01:48:58,920
Yeah

1220
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:07,080
You've stolen that from me strong complain about paying a 1% wagery. You've yanked it. How dare you?

1221
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:19,240
2000 this is okay, we're gonna get the five in a building we can do it. I believe I believe

1222
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:23,080
2.4

1223
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:25,080
Don't mind if I do

1224
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:28,920
All right productivity come on

1225
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:34,440
Capacity and then staffing is 2.5

1226
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:37,720
You do not make as much as the others though

1227
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:44,840
You hardly make that much fans either. I'm just better at buying fans

1228
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:49,720
With the ads on twitter ever lie surely not

1229
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:53,560
Play red dead redemption to actually want to play it

1230
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:55,880
Um

1231
01:49:55,880 --> 01:50:02,120
I've never played it before but everyone went crazy when it came out and apparently you can role play on it like gta servers

1232
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:04,200
people like role play on gta servers

1233
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:07,240
To stress out that's understandable. Have a nice day

1234
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:16,600
Right our new girl who will we pick bailey asian and chubby and they called her bailey and she's chubby

1235
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:20,840
She caters to chubby and she's called bailey. Okay, you're done

1236
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:27,320
bailey was a conservative yoga instructor until recently when she discovered her true nature and frankly she kind of a freak

1237
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:30,600
Um

1238
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:36,600
Brooke is a wife mother in business woman who seeks out attention online from young men because her boring husband leaves her drier than a desert

1239
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:44,600
Oh my gosh, okay. Lilian looks good to me. Lilian moved in from the pacific to get away from our strict family

1240
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:50,760
She's asian and flat-chested. Yes. She never drinks so that is good. We can put an item on her

1241
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:54,120
Right, so she is now waiting

1242
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:59,400
To get stuff done which is fine

1243
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:07,960
Uh, we'll send her off to get new items because if we can get another subscriber pillow that would be good

1244
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:12,600
Um

1245
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:18,200
Oh wait, can I get her now? Oh, I can I can already get her. Oh, we've got one more slot left

1246
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:23,000
Right, you never drink so we don't need to give you wine

1247
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:25,080
half price

1248
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:30,120
No smoking. We're about to get you an item though. Actually, I might send you in for an item as well

1249
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:34,520
We're doing every flanks

1250
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:39,080
We're gonna win totally wink wink. We're gonna win

1251
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:40,920
I

1252
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:46,600
Might actually recommend the other viola girls play this because it seems like it takes like two hours per run

1253
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:53,480
Seriously, right. I'm going to try and get the last girl. I didn't realize how close to 71 days we were

1254
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:56,360
right invest in who glasses

1255
01:51:57,400 --> 01:52:01,160
We're going to invest in uh nicky because she's so good

1256
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:15,000
I'd just invest in it random and hope it pays off. It's a boy disney

1257
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:20,520
That's because promo is promo

1258
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:26,600
Yes, fantastic go again. Oh my god. She's 3000 per shot now

1259
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:30,200
No, it's a new day. I missed it drat

1260
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:36,280
1000 really isn't like good. I might just keep telling her to go get more fans

1261
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:41,960
Oh

1262
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:44,440
Oh, no, she makes more than the other girl though

1263
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:49,320

We just need a nicotine patch and we can get the last girl just like that

1267
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Go make some fans

1268
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,040
Oh wait, we didn't get a nicotine patch this time

1269
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:11,480
Oh

01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:17,720

1274
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:30,760
What does she need she needs another tag that we can capitalize on about you

1275
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:37,560
You can just take on anything as well. Okay, right. We're gonna send you back into the shop

1276
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:42,760
There's no five in the camp studio, which is hilarious

1277
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:48,040
I'm not sure you're gonna get the diamond trophy. I'm not even sure we're gonna get the last recruit

1278
01:53:48,120 --> 01:53:50,440
It costs 10,000 to pick up someone now

1279
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:53,880
Literally 10,000 to get the last girl

1280
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:57,160
That's insane

1281
01:53:58,280 --> 01:54:00,680
I mean, I think we can do it but

1282
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:05,400
Nikki is coming in clutch right now with this subscribe pillow is insane

1283
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:09,480
Absolutely insane go again

1284
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:14,040
Motel time

1285
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:17,400
Possibly

1286
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:22,680
We can't even pick up the money that fast like it's taken so long

1287
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:27,400
So we can't even like make the time go by faster

1288
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:31,320
Any point in doing for sure

1289
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:33,000
Oh

1290
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,400
Maybe I do need to invest in the money thing

1291
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:40,280
Ha it seems like such a waste though, right water nikkies assets

1292
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:44,040
Glasses big and water

1293
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:46,920
glasses water

1294
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:50,120
big and glasses

1295
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:52,120
no

1296
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:54,120
huh

1297
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:59,400
I'm sure just gonna make some more fancy right pro right invest in the freaking money thing

1298
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:04,680
So we can actually upgrade the team because it's not even letting us upgrade the dang team

1299
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Sure

1300
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:16,200
Neckle ears or bandage. We just do bandage

1301
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:21,400
Oh

1302
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:25,320
Wow someone should draw of running the casting couch

1303
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:28,440
Steady on that's funny

1304
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:31,400
Right, can I grab all this money?

1305
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:35,480
You're too stressed out right well unstressed yourself right now

1306
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:45,320
Go go go please give me ten thousand right now right you make three thousand that's so good

1307
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:51,000
I think we can get the girl we're literally on the 21st day. We're about to get the last freaking girl

1308
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:53,320
Well, we're on the 18th day my pardon

1309
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:57,080
That's a nicotine patch. Oh, did I mess up right?

1310
01:55:57,640 --> 01:55:59,080
What did I do?

1311
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:04,200
You're full you're full you're full full full. Oh, you can still actually get an item

1312
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:08,040
Even after all this time

1313
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:14,200
Right, someone's getting sent to go and pick up a new girl. I don't know who it is. I don't care who it is

1314
01:56:15,160 --> 01:56:17,480
Hopefully we can have someone that's a non-smoker

1315
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:22,920
But go go get a new girl

1316
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:25,480
What else you got

1317
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:27,960
Staffing go

1318
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:30,520
We're max on staffing

1319
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:32,520
go

1320
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:35,720
We're doing it. That's where the income upgrade comes in. Yes

1321
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:40,440
I'm starting to understand why they offered it because it made no sense. I was like, yeah collect money faster

1322
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:42,440
But it's because you can't upgrade

1323
01:56:42,680 --> 01:56:47,000
The dang thing you did fantastic. Go make some fans

1324
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:49,880
Oh

1325
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:52,600

01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:55,240
Sure, let's just buy a few things

01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:04,360
Go again you make 3000. Oh my gosh

1329
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:07,720

01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:10,520

50,000 wait, that isn't even the last upgrade

1332
01:57:17,320 --> 01:57:23,560
That is insane that is in the last upgrade

1333
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:29,640
Okay

01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:38,280

Candice candies nuts. Thank you

1339

1340
01:57:57,800 --> 01:58:01,960
1000 fans she brings on but you've already levelled up completely

1341
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:09,720
Marlina is a brazilian bombshell who basically cost her life on the rebellion look. She's very confident and extremely narcissistic

1342
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:17,560
Marlina bosom stop candies nuts. Candice is kind of an earhead who just goes along with whatever people say. She's a professional

1343
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:20,120
with a big

1344
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:23,560
Candice is a non-smoker

1345
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:28,680
Oh, she's yeah. Okay. Candice is the best because we can put a slot on her

1346
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:33,720
Enjoy a full staff of eight girls. Let's go

1347
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:37,800
So give her wine. She's now half price

1348
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:44,280
Go get items for yours. Oh, you're too stressed. That's fine

1349
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:47,800
Okay

1350
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:53,640
Now we can just focus on doing generic upgrades like having more girls in the studio at one time

1351
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:59,960
3000 3000 you're too stressed. That's fine. You're allowed to be stressed

1352
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:02,760
They come to brazil

1353
01:59:03,320 --> 01:59:05,960

It's day 19

1356
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:19,960
It looks like we will get our productivity upgrade, which is what I want to see

1357
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:28,920
You did sagoy, doesn't it as always you did fantastic if you give girls. Mm-hmm. They can go to the

1358
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:35,080
How do I get girls strongy? Uh, uh, uh, I have terrible news

1359
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:39,480
I don't know how because I'm not a guy and I don't know what it's like to try and get a girl

1360
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:43,560
Right everyone go pick up items because I think

1361
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:47,480
2.4 really isn't like good

1362
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:55,000
Okay, subscribe pillow. Sorry subscribe pillows to op you're too stressed out. That's fine, right

1363
01:59:55,800 --> 02:00:02,200

Go work

1366
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:07,560
Everyone go work

1367
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:12,920
If mommy's the one stressing me I would enjoy it. Isn't that clearly you just got a hiring agency

1368
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:18,280
I mean you could if you want to do it, right promo

1369
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:21,880
2000s for promo

1370
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:28,760
But you're getting like 300 at a time. Whoa, that's wait. Hold on. I picked up a pillow

1371
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:31,560

1372
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:38,520
Yeah, everyone's now full so no one needs to go to the shop again. Oh, I just closed my game again

1373
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:42,040
No one needs to go to the shop

1374
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:45,560
Again, so we're wasting our time being in the shop right now. I'm not even kidding

1375
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:49,400
Go sure why not and go

1376
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:59,240
Another subscribe pillow so op I'll just grab it right go get some fans go work

02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:06,700
I just grabbed subscriber pillows. It's fine

1379
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:13,400
Second has a free slot does she oh she does let's go

1380
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:18,760
Thank you. I didn't know us. Okay. No one has a free slot now. We're good to go

1381
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:23,400
Everyone just makes some fucking money

1382
02:01:23,480 --> 02:01:25,480
Hey

1383
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:30,120
And then we can invest in this picking up money thing because it's getting in the way

1384
02:01:32,280 --> 02:01:34,280
It's getting in the way clout for

1385
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:38,760
Look, it doesn't matter just be yourself. I had that workspace exactly

1386
02:01:40,360 --> 02:01:42,360
If you have to change

1387
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:47,160
Then is it true love if you're not being yourself you're too stressed out

1388
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:52,280
Okay, we're at 10 000 promo. Do we bother with promo?

1389
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:58,040
Just buy it just just buy. Okay. Just buy it

1390
02:01:59,480 --> 02:02:01,480
Okay, we're not going off yet

1391
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:06,680
Just buy all the promo because it's fans and it means I don't have to send them to the cast and oh

1392
02:02:06,760 --> 02:02:11,400
I've done it again. Stop clicking off your good figure right work work

1393
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:13,960
Everyone go work

1394
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Do I make myself clear?

1395
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:21,000
Work work work. Oh, we're at max capacity

1396
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:26,360
Okay, go wait who makes more you make more

1397
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:33,400
Hold on hold on i'm gonna invest in the max capacity 25 000

1398
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:40,040
I really i'm not gonna waste it. I'll just get her to get more fans

1399
02:02:40,680 --> 02:02:46,280
Whoever is that lower one look at all those subscribers. They got 10 000 subscribers. Let's go

1400
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:53,640
Oh, they got 9.7 000 subscribers. They got more subscribers than me and it's like they've been at it for 21 days

1401
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:56,840
They're cheating

1402
02:02:57,480 --> 02:03:00,200
Uh go make some more fans

1403
02:03:03,240 --> 02:03:05,640
Okay, we're on the last day I think

1404
02:03:08,680 --> 02:03:10,680
Go go

1405
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:15,080
I don't know if we can do the

1406
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:18,440
Invest in anything more really

1407
02:03:20,680 --> 02:03:25,400
Maybe this I don't send anyone on photo shoots though. So it's not really a point

1408
02:03:27,320 --> 02:03:32,920
I'll do accounting for now because they're grabbing so much money. It's like hard

1409
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:40,200
Right you hardly make nothing so let's not waste our time you make 4k

1410
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:46,200
Maybe we can get the upgrade you did fantastic, but you're too stressed. That's okay

1411
02:03:47,640 --> 02:03:50,040
I'm getting the silver trophy aw ye

1412
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:54,360
Hi, I love how she does that

1413
02:03:58,280 --> 02:04:00,280
5 000

1414
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:03,400
Well, I just buy it in promo maybe

1415
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:05,400
I

1416
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:12,760
Have no idea what to do at this point. I mean I've got everyone and people are just rotating between like

1417
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:18,600
5 000 that's good. We're just rotating between like

1418
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:25,080
I don't really make a lot. I feel like the girls make a bit more than you

1419
02:04:25,640 --> 02:04:28,840
How the fuck is goth not making money? I tell everything I owe for her

1420
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:36,440
I've not leveled them all up at any point. Um, Candice is too stressed. That's fine

1421
02:04:43,720 --> 02:04:45,720
Might as well

1422
02:04:48,040 --> 02:04:49,080
Oh

1423
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:54,680
Right, let's go optimize for fans. I've not maxed my investments because I suck

1424
02:04:55,400 --> 02:05:02,280
Okay, we've got 25 let's buy capacity so everyone can be making money

1425
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:06,120
It doesn't matter if they're low or high everyone can make money

1426
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:08,760
That's the focus

1427
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:11,240
Go make money

1428
02:05:11,880 --> 02:05:15,720
So I can pay everyone off because I actually need to pay for everyone's thing

1429
02:05:16,360 --> 02:05:18,360
I think we're about to end

1430
02:05:18,760 --> 02:05:24,120
Does the game let you continue to play or you're too stressed

1431
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:33,240
I'll just keep the money on hand or do I get like points for fan amount maybe possibly

1432
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:36,680
Go oh you're too stressed

1433
02:05:38,120 --> 02:05:43,400
Go make money go go go. Oh, it's the last day today. Okay

1434
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:47,640
It's the last day today. I don't think we can do anything in particular

1435
02:05:48,760 --> 02:05:53,400
You'd have to do a new run bronze five silver 10 25 fans is

1436
02:05:54,040 --> 02:05:56,040

02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:08,920
Oh, we're not gonna reach platinum. There's no way

1441
02:06:11,640 --> 02:06:13,640
There's no way we're reaching platinum

1442
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:17,480
I can't see it

02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:20,680

I'm going to do back-to-back membership streams. I'm gonna do daily membership streams and public streams

1450
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:49,480
um

1451
02:06:49,480 --> 02:06:52,600
I always got free content coming out. I actually have a patreon audio

1452
02:06:53,480 --> 02:06:58,200
Early access for youtube. I don't know if I can upload it yet. It's me sitting on the mic ASMR

1453
02:06:58,440 --> 02:07:00,360
But because I was like squatting over it

1454
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:03,080
I was getting out of breath and I'm like I can't upload it

1455
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:07,320
Like I've got two shorts that I want to upload but I don't want to do it until the warning's gone

1456
02:07:07,720 --> 02:07:12,520
In case I get a warning for it because I really do not want to strike. I do not want to break my streaming streak

1457
02:07:13,400 --> 02:07:17,240
Um, I would be so upset and mad at myself if I did

1458
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:25,800
We've been thoroughly drained into literally you thought my stamina was good for like bruvs you're done for

1459
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:33,240
Oh man, thank you for the 10 gifted memberships. Congrats to whoever caught them with your face

1460

1462
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:48,840
Fans we could have got 25k, but we can't do it

1463
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:53,800
Unless what 64 fans that's not going to cut it. Are you joking?

1464
02:07:55,480 --> 02:08:01,000
Right, we've got 300 more fans we can buy new emotes. Yes new emotes are on the way for everyone

1465
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:04,680
Emmy and aces new emotes have already been uploaded

1466
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:09,480
They should be lurking in the shadows. They actually have a few more emotes slots to go

1467
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:11,960
So they can get more if they so desire

1468
02:08:13,480 --> 02:08:15,480
8k for that. Wow

1469
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:22,920
Um, I don't need emotes when I have what png that wasn't a png heart. Well

1470
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:26,360
Um

1471
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:29,160
Uh-oh

1472
02:08:34,680 --> 02:08:36,680
Okay, go are you too stressed?

1473
02:08:37,320 --> 02:08:39,000
Right, we've done it

1474
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:46,920
We finished our run. This is the last night. We ended with 20 000 that's not horrific. It could have been worse

1475
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:50,120
It could have been worse

1476
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:52,440
Could have been worse

1477
02:08:53,720 --> 02:08:55,720
Um

1478
02:08:56,600 --> 02:09:00,920
Could have been worse, but I'll just leave the money on hand. I don't want to end when we can't pay them

1479
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:03,720
So we'll just shove them back in here

1480
02:09:04,840 --> 02:09:06,840
png that wasn't a png. Wow

1481
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:15,480
Time flies you're having fun, doesn't it? That was two hours to play that. That's fun. That was like a perfect stream game for one run

1482
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:21,080
Oh god, complete a game session without dropping below five cigarettes or drinks. Oh

1483
02:09:21,880 --> 02:09:23,880

1489
02:09:44,600 --> 02:09:48,920

1497
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:34,120

02:11:13,720 --> 02:11:15,720
What's next?

1505
02:11:16,440 --> 02:11:18,440
Immersion broken

02:12:26,440 --> 02:12:28,040

Maximum capacity. Oh, you're stress free. Sure. Go get some fans in

1530
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:01,480
What are you gonna do after stream? Um, today I am going to a cafe with my dad

1531
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:06,760
I had to cancel it yesterday because I went to sleep. Um, I was not very well all yesterday

1532
02:13:07,080 --> 02:13:13,400
What do you mean pushing yourself daily is a terror? Wait, why he cost 13 000 to get that? I'm not buying them anymore

1533
02:13:14,760 --> 02:13:18,280
No, we're not going to meet cafe. No, lol

1534
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:20,760

02:13:28,040 --> 02:13:34,600
Streaming and then like doing stuff every single day. So the plan is every other day. We're gonna try and do something

1537
02:13:35,560 --> 02:13:36,600
um

1538
02:13:36,600 --> 02:13:43,080
Because I was like hyper stressed out yesterday like I was watched back some of the stream and I was like really unhappy

1539
02:13:43,080 --> 02:13:45,880
I was like, why did I even stream like that's so silly

1540
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:50,280
I just felt like dumb that I pushed myself to do it

1541
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:54,680
But I'm glad I didn't like take a day off or anything because that would annoyed me true

1542
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:57,160
True AF dempa. How are you doing?

1543
02:13:58,120 --> 02:13:59,960
Candice is too stressed out

1544
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:01,960
She is

1545
02:14:02,120 --> 02:14:03,240
And

1546
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:09,480
What's too stressed out? That's fine. You're allowed to be stressed out. It's only human nature. I'm only human

1547
02:14:10,040 --> 02:14:15,320
Buildings can have eight girls in them. Yeah, I think I'm gonna do that because that's hilarious eight key

1548
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:18,200
Nine key not bad

1549
02:14:18,680 --> 02:14:20,680
How long is your dad gonna stay?

1550
02:14:22,280 --> 02:14:29,960
We actually so I thought it was three weeks. It's not it's already two weeks. Your dedication is inspiring

1551
02:14:30,040 --> 02:14:32,040
Thank you. It's the autism

1552
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:34,760
You want to make six thousand?

02:14:52,280 --> 02:14:54,280
Anything shove on anyone

1557
02:14:54,280 --> 02:14:56,120
Doesn't matter who

1558
02:14:56,120 --> 02:14:58,120
The more fans the better

1559
02:14:58,760 --> 02:15:05,640
Keep telling you to take it easy. I will eventually well I go jumped from five thousand to eight thousand per go

1560
02:15:05,720 --> 02:15:07,720
Hold on get some more fans

1561
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:11,400
Everyone's going to the photo shoot because what the heck? Why was that so much?

1562
02:15:14,920 --> 02:15:21,080
How much do you make you too stressed out? What do you she makes fans every time she goes so

1563
02:15:22,280 --> 02:15:25,160
Payroll processed. I didn't go in the negative. Let's go

1564
02:15:26,120 --> 02:15:28,120
You're too stressed out

1565
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:34,520
Mmm

1566
02:15:35,480 --> 02:15:41,240
Right, let's make if you're not at ten thousand per show then you're getting shoved into the photo studio

1567
02:15:43,400 --> 02:15:48,600
Ten thousand you make three thousand you make nothing. Please don't do that. That's how she must have lost something

1568
02:15:48,760 --> 02:15:50,840
I don't know what oh you play getcha

1569
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:55,000
Your dad's a favorite food, uh, no idea

1570
02:15:56,360 --> 02:15:57,880
Please kill me

1571
02:15:57,880 --> 02:15:59,880
You're so real for them

1572
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:04,520
Um, we made chicken last night, but I'm having steak today

1573
02:16:05,480 --> 02:16:07,480
Okay, she makes ten thousand so you can go in

1574
02:16:08,280 --> 02:16:10,280
You have my permission to go do a show

1575
02:16:11,560 --> 02:16:13,560
um

1576
02:16:14,360 --> 02:16:16,360
You do not make ten thousand yet

1577
02:16:18,280 --> 02:16:20,280
Are we

1578
02:16:21,080 --> 02:16:23,080
Are we making nothing? I'm gonna have to upgrade her

1579
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:28,920
Nine thousand go you make twelve thousand

1580
02:16:30,680 --> 02:16:35,080
These girls are making that mula you make eight thousand. Maybe I need to

1581
02:16:35,880 --> 02:16:41,320
Do that. Yeah, I think I need to upgrade them. Why isn't he kicking? He is he's kicking for me. I've never eaten so good

1582
02:16:41,800 --> 02:16:43,800
I've never washed so good as well

1583
02:16:44,040 --> 02:16:48,120
It's like I'm actually having daily showers a Christmas miracle right everyone's going to the club

1584
02:16:49,080 --> 02:16:51,880
As well. Everyone's getting fans. Everyone's going to the club

1585
02:16:53,160 --> 02:16:57,560
I will do glasses because uh nicky's glasses and she's currently our biggest money maker

1586
02:17:00,360 --> 02:17:02,360
Okay, ten thousand that's good

1587
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:06,200
Eight thousand right that there

1588
02:17:08,680 --> 02:17:11,640
Did slow cook more I did marinate a chicken with them

1589
02:17:11,800 --> 02:17:17,160
He I like have never bought ziploc bags to marinate chicken before but I really enjoyed it

1590
02:17:17,480 --> 02:17:23,640
So I'll probably be doing it on this on my own when it goes away. You have rubbish fans

1591
02:17:26,360 --> 02:17:30,760
Your fans hate you what's going on here the pheromones it's ogre

1592
02:17:32,360 --> 02:17:34,360
So any work in the girls like

1593
02:17:37,880 --> 02:17:43,400
Ten thousand right you're allowed to go you're too stressed. What are you you're ten thousand you're allowed to go

1594
02:17:44,120 --> 02:17:48,600
And I'll send them to the studio to get a few more fans as well

1595

Eight thousand not enough go make some more fans

Okay, ten thousand right you're getting a bit better. We're gonna put your style up though

1610
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:28,280

So everyone can go to work if we want

1618
02:19:56,200 --> 02:19:57,800
Which is good

1619
02:19:57,800 --> 02:20:02,680
You weren't kidding about the fool. Hey, can he help it cannot for the life of him help it

1621
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:08,920
Don't say my name. I don't know how many times I said I've said a stream

1622
02:20:09,720 --> 02:20:13,160

No name got dropped. Thank you for checking. I appreciate it

1626
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:27,800
So basically your POV was

1627
02:20:33,640 --> 02:20:36,840
That was your POV she was brining along double two

1628
02:20:37,880 --> 02:20:39,880
I can't tell you if I heard or not. Mm-hmm

1629
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:42,920
He's innocent. He taught me

1630
02:20:43,560 --> 02:20:50,520
Finish pure path. But I don't worry. He's not actually in trouble. He understands. It's silence. You screaming. Don't say my name

1631
02:20:53,640 --> 02:20:57,800
Um, I thought you're screaming because no cola. That's hilarious

1632
02:20:58,680 --> 02:21:00,920
Maybe her name is chicken. You've got me

1633
02:21:03,240 --> 02:21:05,240
You're too stressed out. That's okay

1634
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:07,880
Right. We have a lot of money

1635
02:21:08,920 --> 02:21:10,360
Let's do

1636
02:21:10,360 --> 02:21:12,360
this one

1637
02:21:12,440 --> 02:21:19,960
Full shoot. Sure. Why not advertisements maxed out? Oh, mate. Wow. Maybe we should advertise maxed out advertisement and just bought

1638
02:21:20,280 --> 02:21:22,280
Fans for that 25k

1639
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:26,440
Get him used to calling you strong. Well, it's because he doesn't need to in any other context

1640
02:21:27,320 --> 02:21:33,080
Yes, I can do that. Give it a shot. Should have muted. I will definitely mute every time I leave the room now because yeah

1641
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:39,400
I thought that was gonna be okay. Okay. Oh, no, I just oh, she's not leveled up enough to utilize any of that

1642
02:21:42,120 --> 02:21:46,680
Maybe the name is ah your POV scream reminded me of starfox 64 death

1643
02:21:47,400 --> 02:21:49,400
fox

1644
02:21:49,400 --> 02:21:51,400
Is it bad?

1645
02:21:52,280 --> 02:21:56,280
Did I do you have butchers headphones? No, I do not actually

1646
02:21:58,200 --> 02:22:00,200
All locations will all collect

1647
02:22:03,160 --> 02:22:07,560
That's the hardware. Why not? We're almost fully maxed out and then we'll just level everyone up

1648
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:14,200
Once you get used to stormy, it's gonna be a problem cause we're strong all the time going forward

1649
02:22:14,280 --> 02:22:17,160
No, I mean if her name is ah, then I think I

1650
02:22:18,120 --> 02:22:24,280
Can't even a few things start a name with that. Oh be Flynn. That's funny. You can't say that out loud

1651
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000

1657
02:22:53,800 --> 02:22:55,800
Cause she doesn't

1658
02:22:56,840 --> 02:22:58,840
You're so real for that

1659
02:22:59,640 --> 02:23:03,160
Maybe I'll send her to get a subscriber pillow

1660
02:23:04,120 --> 02:23:06,120

It was called like explosion veiler and it's me talking about the sonic heroes. Oh, I see

1711
02:27:09,320 --> 02:27:15,160
Someone was like plagiarism and I'm like, no motherfucker. That's called influence. You can be influenced by things

1718
02:27:41,720 --> 02:27:45,800
You can hear the influence if you listen to the song, but it's completely different

1719
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:48,600
We've been influenced by a moment

1720
02:27:49,480 --> 02:27:51,000
Too stressed

1721

1759
02:30:59,800 --> 02:31:01,800
Okay

1760
02:31:02,200 --> 02:31:04,200
Lady Gaga not the disc is thick

1761
02:31:05,880 --> 02:31:10,440
I'm on it. I love this game. Sorry. I'm absolutely adoring this game to hymen

1762
02:31:11,400 --> 02:31:15,000
Okay to the kingdom high heavens come this is so good

1763
02:31:17,560 --> 02:31:22,120

1765
02:31:35,080 --> 02:31:37,080

02:31:40,600 --> 02:31:42,600
Are you serious right now?

1767
02:31:44,280 --> 02:31:47,000
Are you serious half a million?

1768
02:31:49,560 --> 02:31:51,560
Together last upgrade

1769
02:31:55,240 --> 02:31:58,680
If you could choose a design any of the girls have for a future den

1770
02:31:59,400 --> 02:32:01,400
I think I want to make she be gay to

1771
02:32:02,760 --> 02:32:06,600
She seems to have an interest in it and if she doesn't want to submit for that

1772
02:32:07,480 --> 02:32:11,640
So, um, if the girls sign on for another year, uh, we

1773
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:15,640
Vealer offer them a free alternative outfit

1774
02:32:15,960 --> 02:32:19,560
Um, they just tell us what they want and we'll get it concepted and if they're happy with it

1775
02:32:19,560 --> 02:32:21,560
We pay for it and all that type thing

1776
02:32:21,720 --> 02:32:28,680
Um, so if she picks something else that isn't gairu, I'd love to offer gairu if she signed on for another year because

1777
02:32:29,480 --> 02:32:31,480
It goes that

1778
02:32:32,520 --> 02:32:34,520
Oh, you're too stressed out completely

1779
02:32:35,480 --> 02:32:37,480
Um

1780
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:40,840
It come

1781
02:32:40,840 --> 02:32:42,520
Sorry, I'm trying to

1782
02:32:42,520 --> 02:32:44,920
Like all play this game, but it's not working in my head

1783
02:32:45,640 --> 02:32:47,640
Time to grind. Yes

1784
02:32:47,960 --> 02:32:49,960
um, I'm currently

1785
02:32:51,320 --> 02:32:58,440
Hyper focused on Azura getting moved out because I think once she moves out she will have so much more time

1786
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:01,400
to be able to

1787
02:33:02,360 --> 02:33:09,400
Really hone her craft because uh, Azura's got it. She just needs enabled and I hope her donathan has come

1788
02:33:09,400 --> 02:33:11,000
It's on the 21st of august

1789
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:16,680
So don't be shy to you know, keep a little little five dollars back. That would be very kind of you even

1790
02:33:17,400 --> 02:33:22,120
Small things add up very quickly. So, uh, please do if you are

1791
02:33:22,840 --> 02:33:24,280
um

1792
02:33:24,280 --> 02:33:29,480
Written for the girls. Um, I would absolutely love to see Azura's donathan go off the wazoo

1793
02:33:30,440 --> 02:33:32,120
Um

1794
02:33:32,120 --> 02:33:34,600
You make absolutely nothing go get some fans

1795
02:33:35,640 --> 02:33:37,640
It's too stressed. That's fine

1796
02:33:37,880 --> 02:33:44,920
Um, she did the gairu classmate roleplay. Yes, we we redirected inter and her per head was coming off her neck

1797
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,160
I do not know how to use the booth stuff

1798
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:50,040
so, um

1799
02:33:50,040 --> 02:33:53,800
What was that half a million that better be the last one because that's insane

1800
02:33:54,680 --> 02:33:56,920
Azura the goat for real for real. Yes. Um

1801
02:33:57,560 --> 02:34:03,640
Like she's interested in doing youtube roleplays like just to put up stuff for free like more content basically

1802
02:34:04,040 --> 02:34:09,480
But due to our living situation, I mean, you know where it's like it's busy houses are busy. That's just how it is. Um

1803
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:14,520
So we're gonna try and get her moved up

1804
02:34:16,280 --> 02:34:20,360
Dullahan gairu bunny stop. That's actually quite funny

1805
02:34:21,640 --> 02:34:23,640
Not in a mean way though

1806
02:34:23,800 --> 02:34:27,000
You just like plop it on to be honest over the top layer

1807
02:34:28,040 --> 02:34:29,560
What what?

1808
02:34:29,560 --> 02:34:31,560

1809
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:37,080

1811
02:34:45,880 --> 02:34:47,880
Okay, we're more fans

1812
02:34:50,760 --> 02:34:52,760
We're almost there

1813
02:34:54,520 --> 02:35:00,440
Optimization literally, I think it must be you need more fans, but I'm like being a twat and not understanding

1814
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,720
Be not afraid. Oh my god. Her headless

1815
02:35:04,360 --> 02:35:07,160

1816
02:35:07,880 --> 02:35:09,880
Be not afraid

1817
02:35:11,080 --> 02:35:15,720
Oh, we're almost there, but we're about to have to pay her wages

1818
02:35:16,680 --> 02:35:18,680
We'll do

1819

Early subscribe pillow leveling the girl's styles, etc. Yeah

50k that's insane 50k for one k

1920
02:43:25,800 --> 02:43:27,800
Are you too stressed?

1921
02:43:28,680 --> 02:43:30,680
And

1922
02:43:31,320 --> 02:43:33,320
I don't think so

1923
02:43:33,320 --> 02:43:36,840
She private it think because she came on hinge and the human was scared to get in a strike

1924
02:43:37,320 --> 02:43:39,720
She's not on a warning though Azura

1925
02:43:40,440 --> 02:43:43,400
Emmy and myself are on a warning

1926
02:43:43,880 --> 02:43:48,600
So she would actually receive a warning unless she's not told me she's got a warning. She even

1927
02:43:48,920 --> 02:43:50,920
Do you have a warning?

1928
02:43:53,400 --> 02:43:55,800
Too stressed out have a spuddy

1929
02:43:57,160 --> 02:43:59,160
Too stressed out have a spuddy

1930
02:44:00,520 --> 02:44:02,840
47 grand she makes here

1931
02:44:06,680 --> 02:44:13,720
We'll just get a hundred key fans and then we'll send Lillian to the motel and we're done

1932
02:44:14,520 --> 02:44:20,600
Um, I got a warning for an audio of me

1933
02:44:21,320 --> 02:44:28,840
Actually, it was because I had the audacity to breathe in the mic. I uploaded an audio called clapping without my hands and

1934
02:44:30,520 --> 02:44:32,840
YouTube time stamped where I went wrong

1935
02:44:33,880 --> 02:44:37,160
What got the warning for and it was when I breathed in the ear of the mic

1936
02:44:38,200 --> 02:44:40,840
It wasn't the actual content of the

1937
02:44:41,480 --> 02:44:42,680
the

1938
02:44:42,680 --> 02:44:44,680
Video if you will

1939
02:44:44,760 --> 02:44:46,760
It was because I breathed in the mic

1940
02:44:47,240 --> 02:44:49,800
And the time stamped it to when I was in the mic like hey

1941
02:44:50,840 --> 02:44:56,200
Yeah, so I might actually be cheeky and upload it again and cut it out at the end section

1942
02:44:57,240 --> 02:44:59,800
Um, because that's what the problem was

1943
02:45:00,920 --> 02:45:02,920
Please kill me

1944
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Okay promo

1945
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
Just buy it all

1946
02:45:07,240 --> 02:45:11,640
50 69 subscribers at all according to plan

1947
02:45:13,640 --> 02:45:20,040
It's funny that the actual clapping was okay. I know it's redonkulous 51,000

1948
02:45:24,280 --> 02:45:26,840
Holy moly 51,000

1949
02:45:29,080 --> 02:45:31,080
58,000

1950
02:45:31,240 --> 02:45:33,240
Oh

1951
02:45:44,120 --> 02:45:46,120
Yeah, you have 20 key fans

1952
02:45:47,160 --> 02:45:52,360
100 fans per photo shoot. I don't know if that's worth it though. I think I'm better just farming

1953
02:45:53,880 --> 02:45:55,880
Advertisements

1954
02:45:55,960 --> 02:45:58,840
Uh, no, leave it to me if you say so

1955
02:46:00,040 --> 02:46:03,560
If you say so over 9,000 on youtube something

1956
02:46:04,200 --> 02:46:06,440
Um, like I have I have two shorts

1957
02:46:06,440 --> 02:46:09,480
I want to upload but I'm too scared to do it until that warning's gone

1958
02:46:09,800 --> 02:46:14,680
But the warning goes away august like 20th, so it's gonna be takes so long

1959
02:46:19,320 --> 02:46:22,760
Because one of them is about ear licking but there's no breathing in it

1960
02:46:23,320 --> 02:46:25,720
And I think it looks okay if there's no breathing

1961
02:46:29,240 --> 02:46:31,240
Yep, I'm going

1962
02:46:32,840 --> 02:46:36,520
Okay promo, uh, just buy anything

1963
02:46:38,440 --> 02:46:42,360
Everyone get to work and yeah august I think august

1964
02:46:43,480 --> 02:46:47,880
12th or something is when it goes away. I can't remember but it's in august

1965
02:46:48,840 --> 02:46:53,240
It's a bit harsh for a warning. Yeah in last 98 well a warning isn't a strike

1966
02:46:53,400 --> 02:47:00,280
So it's actually more preferred to get a warning because if I got a strike it meant I couldn't stream for an entire week

1967
02:47:00,760 --> 02:47:04,360
Um, which that would have that would have upset me far more than

1968
02:47:05,400 --> 02:47:07,400
anything else

1969
02:47:07,880 --> 02:47:12,760
Can't wait for the orwell stream tinfoil hat. Oh, yeah pure tinfoil hat. I'm not even kidding

1970
02:47:13,560 --> 02:47:17,080
Um, it is a bit of a reading simulator, but don't worry. I'll do the reading

1971
02:47:19,080 --> 02:47:21,320
I'll do all of that jazz so you don't have to think

1972
02:47:21,960 --> 02:47:23,800
um

1973
02:47:23,800 --> 02:47:26,120
I played it many a year ago now

1974
02:47:26,680 --> 02:47:31,240
So I don't actually and I never fit it. I never got the correct ending in the game

1975
02:47:31,240 --> 02:47:35,160
So we're gonna try and get it together. You guys might be able to figure it out before I can

1976
02:47:36,520 --> 02:47:38,520
Um

1977
02:47:38,520 --> 02:47:40,520
But yes

1978
02:47:40,680 --> 02:47:44,920
Anything else more work 51 000. Let's go

1979
02:47:48,840 --> 02:47:51,880
I will promo uh chubby

1980
02:47:53,960 --> 02:47:58,840
A week without money mommy. I don't want to a imagine a week without money money

1981
02:47:59,800 --> 02:48:01,960
I said it the wrong way, but I know what I was trying to say. Okay. Me

1982
02:48:03,080 --> 02:48:04,680
At least just rest up

1983
02:48:04,680 --> 02:48:08,040
They probably don't want mode schools to the make I think you're looking

1984
02:48:08,600 --> 02:48:12,680
I don't know if I think is breathing with ear licking at the moment. Um

1985
02:48:13,720 --> 02:48:16,680
It's rather strange what's going on. Um

1986
02:48:18,520 --> 02:48:23,080
Rather strange indeed. I wish they would just come out and be like hey, you can't do this anymore

1987
02:48:23,720 --> 02:48:27,400
But youtube's was like ASMR is like the top 10 searches

1988
02:48:28,280 --> 02:48:30,280
and

1989
02:48:31,560 --> 02:48:36,040
So obviously they probably don't want to be like publicly coming out with like oh we

1990
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
Have fun it by the way

1991
02:48:40,440 --> 02:48:45,720
Just need to find the new ASMR mail. Well, I've ordered the denpa

1992
02:48:46,920 --> 02:48:47,880
Uh

1993
02:48:47,880 --> 02:48:53,000
Mould shall we call it? If you know what I'm saying denpa did a very egregious audio

1994
02:48:54,120 --> 02:48:56,120
Okay, which made me laugh more so

1995
02:48:57,240 --> 02:49:03,160
Are we at a thousand? Hey everyone's at a thousand! It was a thousand for for the diamond, right?

1996
02:49:03,400 --> 02:49:05,400
Oh

1997
02:49:05,640 --> 02:49:08,920
The chill bro, you got the ace. Yes, I got the ace

1998
02:49:10,120 --> 02:49:13,400
Um, I also am getting another prop

1999
02:49:14,120 --> 02:49:17,320
Um for a stream and also the 10 key stream

2000
02:49:18,840 --> 02:49:20,840
I think it was 100k

2001
02:49:24,520 --> 02:49:28,760
What is a denpa denpa is a fellow vtuber

2002
02:49:29,240 --> 02:49:32,680
Um, and I collabed with her on the alien collab that's on my channel

2003
02:49:33,400 --> 02:49:41,320
Two out of six isolure confirmed. Yeah, I sorry, but um, he's actually so smart. I'm legit copy and pasting her strats

2004
02:49:43,400 --> 02:49:45,400
Denpa cooked with that one

2005
02:49:46,600 --> 02:49:48,600
At denpa literally

2006
02:49:49,400 --> 02:49:53,720
I'm sorry. I suppose youtube doesn't have more competitors for some of their weird occurrences

2007
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,320
So it's been tried. What's her name?

2008
02:49:58,280 --> 02:50:03,240
Uh, is it it's not frivolous folks. What's that other asmr?

2009
02:50:04,040 --> 02:50:05,800
uh

2010
02:50:05,800 --> 02:50:07,560
Gibi

2011
02:50:07,560 --> 02:50:08,600
Asmr

2012
02:50:08,600 --> 02:50:10,600
Attempted it and it didn't work

2013
02:50:12,920 --> 02:50:13,960
It

2014
02:50:13,960 --> 02:50:15,160
Because

2015
02:50:15,160 --> 02:50:22,360
You need people you can't have free users on it, but it's still like didn't work at the end of the day, which is such a shame

2016
02:50:23,160 --> 02:50:27,240
How much oh, but you get so many fans for it though

2017
02:50:29,720 --> 02:50:33,160
There was a youtube for asmr. I wish

2018
02:50:34,920 --> 02:50:36,920
They realized if they had ads

2019
02:50:37,720 --> 02:50:39,640
um

2020
02:50:39,640 --> 02:50:45,240
If they had asmr friendly ads like people would be more likely to run ads like at this point in time

2021
02:50:45,720 --> 02:50:48,680
YouTube force ads at the start and end of videos

2022
02:50:48,840 --> 02:50:52,600
It never used to be like that, but now it is like that which is a shame

2023
02:50:53,880 --> 02:50:57,480
100k reach. Okay. Is that it's done. Is that what the diamond was?

2024
02:51:00,840 --> 02:51:04,680
Shubby flat chested put all my stonks in there

2025
02:51:06,680 --> 02:51:10,120
It's also expensive af to host. Yeah, literally

2026
02:51:11,240 --> 02:51:17,960
I don't know if uh another site could be right raised up like that like youtube have a monopoly

2027
02:51:18,680 --> 02:51:20,680
Oh

2028
02:51:23,560 --> 02:51:28,360
It is a very I love listening to soft asmr playlist and then being blasted by a trucker

2029
02:51:28,360 --> 02:51:34,200
Yeah, like I don't know how on earth they come out and be like, yeah asmr is in the top 10 searches

2030
02:51:34,600 --> 02:51:38,040
But haven't cracked that if they had acceptable

2031
02:51:38,600 --> 02:51:40,120
levels of

2032
02:51:40,120 --> 02:51:42,280
You are really lagging behind why?

2033
02:51:43,080 --> 02:51:48,760
Oh, she doesn't have a third thing to bounce off of

2034
02:51:58,680 --> 02:52:03,320
To make another youtube you would need a time machine. Yeah, like the competition is so hard like

2035
02:52:04,120 --> 02:52:06,440
I think rumble is probably the only

2036
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:11,480
It's not even a competitor. Oh, no, I just put no, I didn't want you in the hotel

2037
02:52:13,160 --> 02:52:19,640
No, it's supposed to be her. Right. I'm putting her in the hotel now

2038
02:52:20,920 --> 02:52:23,880
Lilithin Lilithin is going in the hotel. Uh

2039
02:52:24,760 --> 02:52:30,360
We will we're gonna let you have some ciggies. Okay, you're gonna need ciggies after this, but take that way. Okay

2040
02:52:31,240 --> 02:52:33,240
So now she's got a piggy bank

2041
02:52:33,480 --> 02:52:36,200
Uh, she needs that. Okay, and then this too

2042
02:52:37,800 --> 02:52:41,400
Man that meet and greets going wild for her. Oh, she's in the photo shoot right now

2043
02:52:42,680 --> 02:52:44,680
I love it. Okay

2044
02:52:46,200 --> 02:52:53,160
We've never done this before wink wink. We're we're gonna send her. I guess if you a little you utilize the sleazy motel

2045
02:52:53,400 --> 02:52:55,400
You could potentially oh, she just said we say

2046
02:52:58,040 --> 02:53:04,680
Okay, go 60k in one hour. Yep. I'm going. Oh, yeah, that definitely seems worth it

2047
02:53:05,320 --> 02:53:10,920
Whoa, we're running a little low on cigarettes and booze. We should really take care of that ASAP

2048
02:53:11,880 --> 02:53:16,440
A lot of these cam girls like to smoke and drink. We haven't unlocked this part of this tutorial

2049
02:53:18,280 --> 02:53:22,680
A girl who smokes and drinks a lot isn't going to get us stressed out from doing activities

2050
02:53:23,720 --> 02:53:29,560
But if you run out of cigs or drinks, she's gonna start to get real stressed out real quick

2051
02:53:29,640 --> 02:53:34,520
Okay, so if it looks like we're running low you need to have somebody run to the store and stock up

2052
02:53:35,400 --> 02:53:38,440
This is the liquor store. Oh my gosh. Wait

2053
02:53:39,240 --> 02:53:41,240
We didn't oh

2054
02:53:42,600 --> 02:53:47,400
I must have like I must have remembered from the fuck I used to watch that you need to maintain this

2055
02:53:49,240 --> 02:53:51,240
That is hilarious

2056
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:56,920
So it takes only 10 cigarettes what?

2057
02:54:00,200 --> 02:54:02,200
Per run

2058
02:54:03,560 --> 02:54:08,360
That's gonna get out of hand so quickly and then actual well, we made a million though

2059
02:54:09,240 --> 02:54:11,240
Yeah, I'm going

2060
02:54:13,400 --> 02:54:15,400
That's crazy

2061
02:54:17,960 --> 02:54:25,400
Oh fantastic needs to get full efficiency liquor IV drip. So we're still in this tutorial. No, we did it. We did it

2062
02:54:27,640 --> 02:54:31,560
Oh, there's a pie chart. Oh tattoos is winning

2063
02:54:34,760 --> 02:54:36,760
Chubby

2064
02:54:39,400 --> 02:54:41,400
Latina's the smallest

2065
02:54:42,760 --> 02:54:49,480
Oh, it like tells you who's like doing that as well. Oh, okay. Okay. Wait, so

2066
02:54:51,320 --> 02:54:53,320
Chubby fit

2067
02:54:53,640 --> 02:54:55,560
Uh, that one

2068
02:54:55,560 --> 02:54:57,320
Okay

2069
02:54:57,320 --> 02:55:00,520
Yeah, you can definitely optimize the heck out of this

2070
02:55:01,240 --> 02:55:07,880
Okay. Yeah, I'm starting to understand goth solo carry. I'm telling you goth is winning. He's still having this though

2071
02:55:09,400 --> 02:55:11,400
Well, I think we did it

2072
02:55:12,520 --> 02:55:15,480
Uh, I think we're we're done. So

2073
02:55:17,320 --> 02:55:21,800
We've gotten what we can total fan count like I don't think we need to do anything

2074
02:55:23,240 --> 02:55:25,880
That was fantastic. I've really enjoyed that game

2075
02:55:26,440 --> 02:55:30,920
Hold on. Let me let me pop my background music on and then mute the game. So it's not annoying

2076
02:55:31,560 --> 02:55:35,560
Uh, right. Let's see if sheepsters is live so I can redirect into her

2077
02:55:35,720 --> 02:55:38,280
Please don't be in a membership stream. Please don't be in a membership stream

2078
02:55:40,360 --> 02:55:43,560
Uh, right customization redirect

2079
02:55:44,680 --> 02:55:49,160
And she's playing elden ring. Let's go. I can redirect into her

2080
02:55:49,800 --> 02:55:53,880
Is she for a cd? No, she's put shields on her chest. That is hilarious

2081
02:55:55,800 --> 02:56:00,600
Uh, the goth will say something like I don't want to take the lead and letting the other girls be ahead of the agency

2082
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,640
Hold on a minute. Is it gonna be a goth girlfriend of vealer too?

2083
02:56:04,360 --> 02:56:09,480
Uh, vealer to the vealer ring. That is hilarious. Let me write that down

2084
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:15,560
It only took you roughly 10 more days to reach the 100k if you didn't want to probably get the gold medal

2085
02:56:15,720 --> 02:56:22,680
No goth girl need a slim girlfriend too. Well next week we're drawing your suggestions on ms paint

That's right. Yumi plus have a concert and I'm getting paid and I get to watch a concert

2092
02:56:53,240 --> 02:56:55,240
I'd rather have goth than slime

2093
02:56:55,240 --> 02:56:59,080
Well, I'm gonna be a goth. I think my alt's probably gonna goth up by me

2094
02:56:59,880 --> 02:57:05,480
Um, I'm gonna keep the hair the same, but we're gonna I'll get myself a concept that does something else
