0	6000	Mummy, the mummy hasn't abandoned no thing.
6000	12000	Mummy is in a foolish, foolish streamer.
12000	16000	When I did the footstream, I put my ring light,
16000	18000	I had to move my ring light so I could,
18000	21000	a little bit of shit and it would be done with the wall.
21000	26000	As it eliminate that mummy started streaming on her hands and knees,
26000	28000	it's not what she did.
28000	32000	Oh, I need the ring light.
32000	38000	The thing that's happening is the goofy and it's jumping about everywhere.
38000	40000	Everyone, hold on.
40000	44000	Oh, but it's going to be light.
44000	46000	Please, it's going to be light.
46000	48000	Okay.
48000	50000	Alright, my face is eliminated.
50000	54000	I'm also on reactive mode, so I'm actually going to react to the game.
54000	58000	Everyone knows I have an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080,
58000	64000	with 10,067 megabits.
64000	67000	Hello, good morning.
67000	73000	Let me put on live chat, any live chatter.
80000	83000	Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.
83000	86000	I apologize if I sound tired.
86000	90000	I passed out after that RuneScape stream,
90000	92000	and I woke up 45 minutes ago.
92000	96000	I hope Icy's monetization stream went fantastic.
96000	98000	I believe Emmys is also today,
98000	101000	so if there's any pin pals or snowberries,
101000	103000	they're down the hall.
103000	106000	Into the lift.
106000	109000	I apologize if I sound tired.
109000	110000	I am exhausted.
110000	111000	I don't know how.
111000	116000	I slept for so long.
116000	119000	I don't know what earth is going on with me.
119000	121000	But I've got cup of tea, I've got two waters,
121000	123000	I've got a wee muffin,
123000	126000	and then we can jump into Crash Bandicoot.
134000	136000	As for any updates, since I slept,
136000	139000	I have absolutely nothing.
139000	143000	A Riefling sent me a three page story,
143000	144000	which I really liked,
144000	146000	but for legal reasons,
146000	149000	I cannot speak any of it here.
149000	155000	I've also put together a little folder of Bibbius,
155000	159000	which I don't know why I didn't think to do earlier.
159000	164000	But now, now I'm putting it all together.
164000	166000	Oh, and a Riefling sent me a five minute audio.
166000	168000	And he was like, talk, yeah.
168000	169000	I was like, oh my God,
169000	172000	Rieflings are getting so brave, honestly.
172000	174000	And before I die a lot, probably,
174000	176000	probably, I'm not even going to put it behind me.
176000	179000	I don't know what level the desktop,
179000	182000	how loud the game's going to be compared to me,
182000	187000	but give me a three page story.
187000	192000	It was about me, obviously.
193000	197000	But yes, you guys have been doing fantastic.
197000	199000	I believe AC's doing well.
199000	201000	There's, I don't really have any updates
201000	203000	about anything else at the moment.
203000	206000	Other than my freaking ASMR meme video,
206000	209000	I've got 30 key views and I'm like, right,
209000	211000	this has definitely left the target audience,
211000	215000	because I had 5,000 subscribers when I posted that,
215000	216000	and now we're at 6,000.
216000	220000	I'm like, bro, that like propelled my channel.
220000	222000	So I'm waiting,
222000	225000	Mercy's is going to go up after the stream
225000	229000	or, or it's going to go up after
229000	232000	she finishes her stream today.
232000	235000	And then AC's is ready to go up.
235000	237000	I may, actually, I'm going to message her
237000	240000	right now so she can reply to me.
240000	244000	Now let's see, when you finished stream,
244000	248000	do you want me to upload your meme ASMR
248000	251000	on your behalf question mark?
251000	252000	And before you're like, wait,
252000	254000	why are you asking the girls permission
254000	256000	to do stuff that you made for them?
256000	259000	Because it's their channels.
259000	261000	I don't want them to be unhappy.
261000	264000	I want them to be happy little ducklings with me.
269000	270000	Who up?
270000	272000	Bandy their cooter.
272000	273000	Whoa.
273000	274000	Okay.
274000	277000	I'm getting a bit too close with that one.
277000	280000	Any Bandy girls.
280000	282000	It's running such a sweetheart.
282000	284000	Yes, I don't want to do anything that upsets the girls.
284000	285000	And if they're like, no,
285000	287000	now's not the time to upload the meme ASMR.
287000	289000	I won't upload the meme ASMR.
289000	290000	That's fine.
292000	295000	So I'll get permission from them
295000	296000	and then possibly after the stream.
296000	299000	Apparently it takes eight hours to do this game.
299000	301000	Now, I'm going to just say,
301000	304000	I was a atom when I played this game.
304000	306000	I have barely any recollection.
306000	308000	My dad didn't buy it for me.
308000	310000	He bought it for himself.
310000	313000	Johnny, congrats on 6.5K.
313000	316000	No, I also made ASMR videos.
316000	319000	I was going to try and get my first thank you video out.
321000	324000	Or maybe after a buckshot roulette after the doc.
324000	326000	Because I've got buckshot roulette.
326000	327000	Then I've got a couple of hours.
327000	329000	Then I go to the doctor.
330000	331000	Is this a rhythm game?
331000	332000	It is not.
332000	333000	It's Crash Bandicoot.
333000	337000	It is an adventure platformer.
337000	340000	I know you can't hear the background of the game right now.
340000	342000	So it's just my voice in this room.
342000	343000	Do forgive.
343000	345000	Johnny, when in a gang?
345000	347000	Any ganky desks?
347000	348000	Hold on.
348000	350000	Let me hydrate with my tea.
353000	354000	I owe so much ASMR.
354000	355000	I do have it all recorded.
355000	357000	I just need to sit and edit it.
357000	360000	And I can't upload the clapping without
360000	362000	using my hands ASMR.
362000	363000	Yet.
363000	365000	I need to have some things in between it.
368000	370000	Strongly winning much in everything, right?
370000	372000	It's a never-ending move.
372000	374000	Every time she releases an ASMR, she gains 1K
374000	376000	and she gets to go back to square one.
376000	377000	Honestly, I'm like, I hope not.
377000	379000	I think it will definitely calm down a bit.
379000	380000	It's going to have to calm down.
380000	384000	Because as much as our capitalist overlords
384000	387000	love infinite growth, that's just not plausible here.
387000	391000	Is it something that is healthy or thingy?
391000	393000	Because if you start measuring yourself by numbers
393000	395000	and that kind of thing, that's when...
395000	397000	I think that's when VTubers probably get it in their head.
397000	399000	They're like, oh, I'm not doing well enough.
399000	400000	I'm not performing well enough.
400000	401000	And it's like, brav.
401000	403000	You haven't even given yourself a chance.
403000	404000	Just have fun.
407000	409000	People can tell you're sweating on trends
409000	411000	if you're trying to sweat on trends, you know?
411000	413000	And then people can tell when you're just memeing around
413000	415000	or you're just memeing around, you know?
415000	416000	And guess what?
416000	417000	Some streamers...
417000	420000	Sorry, this is just turning into a philosophical...
420000	424000	Let's digest and get to the roots of why streamers are streamers.
424000	427000	Some people are just...
429000	430000	What's the word?
430000	434000	Optimised to have a nice, cosy, tight-knit community.
435000	439000	Some people, some of your personalities, other streamers,
439000	441000	you're just supposed to have a nice little tight-knit community.
441000	444000	You're not supposed to be for the masses, you know?
444000	448000	So don't always be reaching for the fricking stratosphere, the stars.
448000	452000	Don't always be reaching for the stars when you do just fine in the stratosphere, you know?
453000	456000	Every time you gain 1k, you release an ASMR that gains you 1k.
456000	459000	It's an infinite feedback loop you'll be at.
459000	462000	Infinity subs by the end of the week.
462000	463000	Not quite.
463000	466000	Especially those looking to extract numbers from TikTok
466000	470000	that only have 100 subs but say they deserve a million views on every post.
470000	471000	Yes.
474000	478000	I can actually get into the psychology on why people
478000	481000	feel they deserve subscribers
481000	485000	versus others who feel unworthy
485000	488000	of what they get because of what they've done.
488000	492000	I could definitely go on an algorithm stream that in...
492000	493000	Not tinfoil time!
493000	495000	No, it's not tinfoil! It's not tinfoil!
495000	496000	It's not tinfoil.
496000	499000	It's like actually, it's like human psychology
499000	503000	as well as the damage that the internet does to the mind.
503000	508000	Because if you didn't know, you're actually not supposed to be exposed to...
508000	513000	I think you're not supposed to actually know more than 100 faces at once.
513000	516000	And your brain is just not wired for any other way.
516000	520000	After that, your brain can only be wired to recognize tribes,
520000	522000	which sounds terrible, but that's just how it is.
522000	527000	So it's like, ah, I am approaching the AC clan, you know?
527000	529000	Or the tribe.
529000	531000	Are you studying psychology?
531000	532000	Absolutely not.
532000	534000	I have had enough of education.
534000	535000	I'm not...
535000	537000	I say that I might be going back to beauty school,
537000	538000	but that's for...
538000	543000	I'm talking like five years down the line beauty school type thing.
543000	551000	Because I might want to run an ASMR room studio type thing.
551000	553000	But that's just me.
553000	554000	That's just me.
556000	559000	Neither tinfoil hat or more.
559000	560000	Do the reeflings?
560000	563000	Honestly, I'm so down for that.
563000	564000	I need the meds to moat back.
564000	566000	I need the thigh gripper moat back.
566000	568000	All other emotes that I need back.
568000	573000	I was actually going to ask if a reefling has any batch to emotes,
573000	580000	wink, wink, if you could send me a cat box file of the batch itself.
580000	582000	So I know what to reorder.
582000	585000	Because I picked what I wanted.
585000	586000	Just so you know.
586000	588000	Just so we're all on the same...
588000	590000	I picked what I wanted.
590000	593000	Oh yeah, Crash Bandicoot 3.
593000	597000	Yes, so I was bought an atom and my dad bought this game for himself.
597000	604000	And the only thing I remember doing on this game is playing Coco on China
604000	607000	and using the horse all the time.
607000	608000	Eh, the horse?
608000	610000	The tiger all the time.
610000	615000	Eh, I'll have to catch stream later as I'm working on 80 slides of insurance termed out.
615000	617000	Ooh!
617000	619000	Even the thought of that is terrible.
622000	625000	I don't know what's going on with my tees.
625000	627000	I've not been enjoying them as of late.
627000	628000	I'm getting a bit...
628000	629000	I'm getting nervous.
629000	631000	I'm getting a bit shaky why I'm not enjoying my tees.
631000	635000	Because normally I'm all over them.
635000	639000	Although I have been enjoying this fruit juice company thing
639000	641000	and they put loads of fruit in the juice
641000	642000	and then they juice it
642000	643000	and then I drink the juice
643000	645000	and then I get all the goodness in me.
645000	646000	Yeah.
650000	651000	I've had too many teas.
651000	655000	This is a very plausible and realistic sense.
655000	656000	Although I've only had one tea the day.
656000	657000	I literally only...
657000	659000	I woke up like...
659000	661000	Well, I woke up an hour ago now.
661000	664000	I woke up, spammed the PC on,
664000	666000	started spamming pre-chat for a few moments,
666000	669000	checked out AC to see what's going on with her.
669000	670000	She's fine.
670000	672000	Checked out the Discord to see if the girls are fine.
672000	673000	They're fine.
673000	676000	Refillings lacking flavour lately.
676000	679000	You're not enjoying the tea because it's all just special, aren't you?
682000	683000	Oh my god.
683000	686000	It sounds terrible, but should I just get a cola?
686000	689000	I don't think drinking a cola first thing in the morning
689000	691000	is a good idea, though.
691000	693000	It's a terrible idea.
696000	698000	Okay, let's get into Crash Bandicoot.
700000	702000	Any Crash Bandicooters?
706000	707000	Is that too loud?
707000	709000	Or is that fine?
710000	711000	Oh my god.
714000	715000	How do I leave?
715000	716000	Oh, my controller isn't even awake.
716000	717000	Hold on.
717000	719000	Yeah, plug my controller in.
722000	723000	So there's three games in it.
723000	725000	I've only ever played Warped.
725000	728000	I don't know what the other two are about.
729000	730000	I guess the game.
733000	734000	Override save.
736000	737000	Is it too loud?
737000	739000	Guys, groovy as anything.
739000	740000	Maybe turn it down a little.
740000	743000	Okay, I'll do it in the start menu after the cutscene.
746000	748000	We're crashing?
748000	751000	I guess we are called Crash Bandicoot.
753000	754000	Thank you.
755000	760000	Free at last.
763000	765000	Oh my god, that's so beautiful.
770000	772000	Oh, it kind of looks like a snowberry.
772000	775000	Ooga, ooga is free.
775000	778000	No, it cannot be.
778000	782000	Evil, great evil has come.
786000	792000	Oh my god, this is so beautiful, this game.
805000	806000	Bandicoot.
815000	818000	Wait, it's a Tiki Mask, like Earth Tiki Mask.
826000	831000	I know we've had a few unfortunate setbacks.
846000	847000	Insane.
848000	849000	Insane.
859000	861000	Oh, I don't remember any of this.
864000	865000	Fuck it.
865000	867000	That was a flashbang first thing in the morning.
867000	868000	Did you see that?
876000	881000	I can't see anymore.
885000	889000	Oh my god, this game is so beautiful and cool.
897000	899000	For real, I think I just got a virus.
905000	910000	Oh, wait, wait, wait, I remember something like that.
916000	919000	Oh my gosh, that was so beautiful.
919000	920000	Wait, hold on.
920000	922000	I need to turn down the volume a little bit.
922000	923000	My apologies.
923000	927000	Game option, music 8.
927000	928000	Wait.
936000	938000	I could do this all day.
939000	941000	We'll do 8s.
945000	947000	Oh my god.
947000	949000	Oh wait, you can't control the camera angle.
952000	953000	What does Y do?
953000	956000	Y shows me my light, what does B do?
956000	957000	No.
957000	961000	Oh my god, POV, I'm coming for AC.
961000	964000	I'm a Snow Berry going for AC.
965000	970000	Oh my god, on the prowl, on the prowl.
970000	973000	Oh my god, this is so precious.
973000	975000	This is so cool.
975000	979000	Oh my god, wait, I remember these symbols a little bit.
996000	999000	Oh look, I have a mask helping me too.
999000	1000000	No.
1000000	1002000	I'll find out which one is more powerful.
1002000	1003000	Soon enough.
1003000	1006000	I mean, it's more powerful because I'm the goodie.
1006000	1007000	You're the baddie.
1010000	1012000	Oh my god.
1012000	1014000	Wait, where does this work?
1014000	1017000	Oh my god.
1017000	1019000	Oh my god, this is like, you can.
1019000	1022000	Oh my god, we flints, we're already on the farm.
1022000	1024000	10 out of 10 game, we're already on the farm.
1024000	1026000	Right, how do I do that?
1026000	1028000	To jump, to spin, to crouch for inventory.
1028000	1030000	Why would I need to see my inventory?
1030000	1033000	I guess if you're going for like 100%, but...
1033000	1035000	Wee!
1035000	1038000	Oh my god, we can bomb.
1038000	1040000	This game is beautiful.
1040000	1042000	I remember that I don't need to hurt it.
1042000	1043000	Oh no, we spanked the goat.
1043000	1044000	Right, we spanked it.
1044000	1045000	We didn't kill it.
1045000	1047000	We spanked it away.
1047000	1049000	Okay, it's fine.
1049000	1051000	What's this?
1051000	1053000	Oh my god.
1053000	1055000	Oh my god.
1057000	1059000	Oh no.
1059000	1061000	Thank you for the 5.
1061000	1063000	Okay, I can definitely take full damage.
1063000	1065000	Oh my...
1065000	1067000	Checkpoint!
1067000	1068000	I'm remembering.
1068000	1070000	Wait, go back on the farm.
1070000	1072000	What does this do?
1074000	1076000	Okay, if you hit it at a certain time.
1076000	1078000	Oh my god, we're on the farm.
1078000	1080000	Right, frogs.
1080000	1082000	Frogs can hurt us.
1082000	1084000	Go back on the farm, where you belong.
1084000	1086000	Go ahead.
1090000	1093000	Oh my god, I can spank everyone.
1093000	1094000	Oh, I love this game.
1094000	1096000	Wait, how about if I get 2 to go because...
1096000	1098000	Oh, he's glowing.
1098000	1100000	Oh, you are glowing.
1100000	1102000	What the heck is it?
1102000	1104000	What did I do?
1104000	1106000	Where am I going?
1106000	1108000	Oh no.
1108000	1110000	What's this?
1110000	1112000	Oh, it's bone.
1112000	1114000	I got an achievement for doing this.
1114000	1116000	It's a bonus level.
1116000	1118000	Wow, what?
1118000	1120000	Bum bum bum.
1120000	1122000	Bum bum bum.
1122000	1124000	Is this just like free apples?
1124000	1126000	Oh my apples.
1126000	1128000	I never picked them up.
1128000	1130000	Oh my god, that's so cool.
1136000	1138000	Who found the dream?
1138000	1140000	The bleeding hearts are getting spanked.
1140000	1142000	For real.
1142000	1144000	A wimpa fruit.
1144000	1146000	A wimpa fruit.
1146000	1148000	One puff fruit.
1148000	1150000	Go back to the farm.
1150000	1152000	Oh, we trick shot with it.
1152000	1154000	The bleeding heart.
1154000	1156000	We trick shot it.
1156000	1158000	Go back to the farm.
1158000	1160000	No frog for Gen 2.
1160000	1162000	Uh...
1162000	1164000	Oh my god, Sheebie really wants a slim girl for Gen 2.
1164000	1166000	I don't know how to break it to her.
1168000	1170000	She really wants a Gen 2.
1170000	1172000	I'm just like, maybe I'll give Sheebie a Halloween outfit.
1172000	1174000	Wait, have we already been here before?
1174000	1176000	Or is this just kind of the same layout?
1178000	1180000	Okay, and it's spanked.
1180000	1182000	What?
1182000	1184000	Pink!
1184000	1186000	Why is there a gap in this bridge?
1188000	1190000	We need someone who works with stone to fix the bridge.
1190000	1192000	We need someone who works with stone to fix the bridge.
1192000	1194000	No slim girl?
1194000	1196000	No, maybe I'll give Sheebie a slim Halloween outfit.
1196000	1198000	How about that?
1198000	1200000	Slim girls.
1200000	1202000	I get the...
1202000	1204000	Oh, wait, so if you miss it, you'll...
1204000	1206000	Okay!
1206000	1208000	I missed a box!
1208000	1210000	Stinky, I don't know where it was.
1212000	1214000	Slim girls are my favorite monster girl.
1214000	1216000	Oh, but slimes are hot.
1216000	1218000	I'm not sure.
1218000	1220000	I don't know.
1220000	1222000	Oh, they came out of my earhole.
1222000	1224000	Oops.
1224000	1226000	And then we just go back in Ninja 2?
1226000	1228000	Oh my gosh, that's cool.
1228000	1230000	This game is easy.
1230000	1232000	I like how fun and easy it is.
1232000	1234000	Lamia is all my favorite.
1234000	1236000	I would entertain a Lamia.
1236000	1238000	Oh, the fisher thing.
1240000	1242000	To kick fast.
1242000	1244000	Whoa!
1244000	1246000	Whoa! Okay, wait, that was very dumb.
1246000	1248000	Sorry. That was incredibly dumb.
1250000	1252000	Whoa!
1252000	1254000	This game is so pretty.
1254000	1256000	Sorry.
1256000	1258000	I've not got much accuracy under the war,
1258000	1260000	even though I'm a cuttlefish.
1260000	1262000	I don't want to...
1262000	1264000	That just like will pass them.
1264000	1266000	Wait, that's a checkpoint.
1266000	1268000	Oh my gosh!
1268000	1270000	I remember something like this.
1270000	1272000	I used to be so scared of it as a child.
1272000	1274000	I thought I only remembered Coco.
1274000	1276000	Oh!
1276000	1278000	I can hear a box back there.
1278000	1280000	Wait, what does that shark do?
1280000	1282000	Please email him.
1282000	1284000	Oh, there's a sand dollar.
1284000	1286000	On the ground.
1286000	1288000	Wow, there's...
1288000	1290000	Jeez, this game is so cute.
1290000	1292000	I can't believe I didn't play this before.
1292000	1294000	Well, I mean...
1294000	1296000	Sorry, I got scared.
1296000	1298000	I don't know if I can hurt those pufferfish.
1298000	1300000	Checkpoint.
1300000	1302000	Why checkpoint?
1302000	1304000	What's here that shouldn't be here?
1304000	1306000	Is there something below that's going to kill me?
1306000	1308000	Because why did I get a checkpoint?
1310000	1312000	You can switch to play Coco!
1316000	1318000	Oh!
1318000	1320000	Oh my gosh!
1322000	1324000	What? I don't wonder this game did so good.
1324000	1326000	It's like so creative.
1328000	1330000	Oh, there is hidden boxes under the coral reef!
1330000	1332000	That's okay.
1332000	1334000	We're not going for 100%
1334000	1336000	because I don't know how to 100% this game.
1336000	1338000	But we can go for lots of fruit.
1340000	1342000	Okay, yummy yummy fruit.
1342000	1344000	Oh, I can beat shark up in this.
1344000	1346000	And I can explode things in this.
1346000	1348000	Let's go.
1348000	1350000	Oh no, I broke it.
1350000	1352000	I'm sorry.
1352000	1354000	I'm a bit of a klutz. I accidentally broke it.
1354000	1356000	Dun dun dun.
1358000	1360000	Oh wait, that's not the song anymore.
1360000	1362000	It's whatever the underwater.
1364000	1366000	Sure, we'll get these boxes.
1366000	1368000	I think it's safe for now.
1370000	1372000	Oh my god.
1372000	1374000	What do you mean I'm so in love with a game
1374000	1376000	that's got the difficulty for literal children?
1376000	1378000	I can't believe it.
1378000	1380000	The accusations are unfounded.
1380000	1382000	I play Skyrim on Legendary mode just because you can.
1382000	1384000	It doesn't mean you need to be...
1384000	1386000	Wait, can I hurt this?
1386000	1388000	Oh no, I can beat up the little puffer fish.
1388000	1390000	Oh, the purple puffers.
1392000	1394000	Okay, there we go.
1394000	1396000	Well, there's the prank crystal.
1396000	1398000	Okay, let's get it.
1398000	1400000	Wait, is that going to explode?
1400000	1402000	Oh wow!
1402000	1404000	If you don't do it in time, it becomes a solid.
1404000	1406000	Okay, that's curious.
1406000	1408000	Is it hard to get 100%?
1408000	1410000	Oh, I missed a lot of boxes this time.
1410000	1412000	Didn't do that good this time.
1412000	1414000	That's okay.
1414000	1416000	I'm happy just loving everything.
1416000	1418000	The scene remains me so much of Jack and Dax though.
1420000	1422000	Jack and Dax.
1422000	1424000	Oh, I threw that one up this time.
1424000	1426000	So it doesn't always come out your ear.
1426000	1428000	Wee!
1428000	1430000	The Orion Express.
1430000	1432000	Coco!
1432000	1434000	Oh, this is the mission!
1434000	1436000	Oh my god, this is the mission!
1436000	1438000	Ah!
1438000	1440000	Coco!
1440000	1442000	And what's the tiger's name?
1442000	1444000	Oh my god!
1444000	1446000	Oh my god!
1446000	1448000	Oh my god!
1448000	1450000	I know it's like first thing in the morning,
1450000	1452000	but I'm so happy!
1452000	1454000	Oh my god, this is the mission that I always
1454000	1456000	remember from childhood.
1456000	1458000	Oh my god, go Coco!
1458000	1460000	Go Coco!
1460000	1462000	You did it!
1462000	1464000	You're so beautiful!
1464000	1466000	Oh my god, it's the music!
1466000	1468000	Ah!
1468000	1470000	Get it, get it, get it, get it!
1472000	1474000	Oh my god, get it, get it, get it!
1474000	1476000	Yes!
1480000	1482000	Oh no, I hurt myself.
1482000	1484000	I didn't know what I was supposed to do there.
1484000	1486000	I forgot, but I got a checkpoint.
1486000	1488000	Oh, I jumped into it!
1488000	1490000	Coco, no!
1490000	1492000	Oh, but it's okay.
1492000	1494000	The tiger forgives me for being a terrible driver.
1494000	1496000	Oh, I did it again!
1496000	1498000	Oh shit, stop jumping!
1498000	1500000	Stop jumping!
1500000	1502000	Okay, no more jumping.
1502000	1504000	No jumpies, jumpies now.
1504000	1506000	But no jumpies.
1506000	1508000	And then big boy jumpies!
1508000	1510000	Oh, I missed!
1510000	1512000	What the heck, I was so close!
1512000	1514000	Oh, if I run ahead, I can attack.
1514000	1516000	Wee!
1516000	1518000	Rawr!
1518000	1520000	Tiger!
1520000	1522000	Ah, how can you...
1522000	1524000	Oh no!
1524000	1526000	It's so bad!
1526000	1528000	Oh my god!
1528000	1530000	Wait, what happens if I run out of lives?
1530000	1532000	Is it over?
1532000	1534000	Is it over for me?
1534000	1536000	This is over for Mesh.
1536000	1538000	Wait, can I just run ahead and hurt them?
1538000	1540000	Wee!
1540000	1542000	Rawr, there was a freaking leap in a half!
1542000	1544000	Call me Jewel Leeper,
1544000	1546000	because one tiger run is all it takes.
1546000	1548000	Wee!
1548000	1550000	Oh my god!
1550000	1552000	This is such a good machine!
1552000	1554000	Oh, my little tiger!
1554000	1556000	Soft kitty, warm kitty,
1556000	1558000	little ball of fluff.
1558000	1560000	Oh, that's the best mission
1560000	1562000	in the entire game.
1562000	1564000	Okay, we can end stream them.
1564000	1566000	That's all we needed to do.
1566000	1568000	Wee!
1572000	1574000	That's all we needed to do.
1574000	1576000	Oh!
1576000	1578000	I don't know what the diamond is.
1578000	1580000	Right, what we got next?
1580000	1582000	The Boneyard!
1586000	1588000	There are like three more of that?
1588000	1590000	Oh my god!
1604000	1606000	What?
1608000	1610000	Oh no!
1610000	1612000	Neurons activated from childhood.
1612000	1614000	Oh no!
1614000	1616000	I think I get chased
1616000	1618000	this entire mission!
1618000	1620000	Oh no!
1620000	1622000	Oh no!
1622000	1624000	There's lava everywhere!
1624000	1626000	It's jumping faster!
1626000	1628000	Oh, I don't know, I'm jumping faster!
1628000	1630000	Oh my god!
1630000	1632000	Why did you do that? Crash!
1632000	1634000	Crash, why did you do that?
1634000	1636000	Crash, jump! Crash!
1636000	1638000	Crash, you need to jump!
1638000	1640000	Like, double jump!
1640000	1642000	Whoa, wait, I can't do it!
1644000	1646000	Wait, can I just stay here forever
1646000	1648000	in the tower?
1648000	1650000	Is that a Tyrannosaurus talk or something like that?
1650000	1652000	Wait, why can I not jump that?
1652000	1654000	Can you double jump it again?
1654000	1656000	Is it...
1656000	1658000	Oh, is it that? Jump, spin?
1658000	1660000	Whoa, I could hardly get over that!
1660000	1662000	Oh no!
1662000	1664000	I can't believe it, childhood
1664000	1666000	me strikes again.
1666000	1668000	Can I not double jump?
1668000	1670000	Hold the jump!
1670000	1672000	Hold the jump?
1672000	1674000	What the heck? I'm not going to make it!
1674000	1676000	I'm going to run out of lava!
1676000	1678000	Oh no!
1678000	1680000	Wait!
1680000	1682000	Wait, it's not doing anything!
1682000	1684000	Hold on, let's practice.
1684000	1686000	Jump, jump, jump, jump!
1686000	1688000	Jump, uh!
1688000	1690000	Uh, uh, uh!
1690000	1692000	Ah!
1694000	1696000	I don't know how to double jump!
1698000	1700000	Uh, uh, uh!
1700000	1702000	Uh, uh, uh!
1702000	1704000	It's not letting me double jump!
1704000	1706000	Oh, it is letting me double jump!
1706000	1708000	Wait, but I jumped right into it!
1708000	1710000	Oh my god!
1710000	1712000	It's so over and the stream
1712000	1714000	hasn't even freaking started!
1714000	1716000	I can't figure it double jump!
1716000	1718000	Is my input wrong?
1718000	1720000	I'm holding A on my controller.
1720000	1722000	There is no double jump.
1722000	1724000	Uh, uh!
1724000	1726000	I'm getting so confused.
1726000	1728000	Is this a child's game or not?
1728000	1730000	Answer me!
1730000	1732000	Is this game for kids to complete or not?
1732000	1734000	It's not looking good.
1734000	1736000	Can't even get through the first freaking jump!
1736000	1738000	Woo!
1738000	1740000	Hey!
1740000	1742000	Dash jump is one way.
1742000	1744000	Is for kids.
1744000	1746000	I'm getting filtered by level 3.
1746000	1748000	I actually am!
1748000	1750000	I don't know how to go through this.
1750000	1752000	Level 3, I actually am!
1752000	1754000	I don't know how to do it!
1754000	1756000	I'm, like, trying to extend the jump.
1756000	1758000	But there's nothing to extend it.
1758000	1760000	It's just a straight magma jump!
1760000	1762000	Woo!
1764000	1766000	You unlock double jump after beating a boss.
1768000	1770000	Wait, so leave and then go to see a boss
1770000	1772000	and come back?
1772000	1774000	Are you holding your jump button
1774000	1776000	down instead of tapping?
1776000	1778000	If I tap, hold,
1778000	1780000	tap.
1780000	1782000	Holding, tapping.
1782000	1784000	Right, hold A.
1784000	1786000	Holding A!
1786000	1788000	Fuck!
1788000	1790000	Holding A!
1790000	1792000	This is me holding A!
1792000	1794000	Okay.
1794000	1796000	It just seems to be, like, so tiny and
1796000	1798000	slate.
1798000	1800000	Like, minuscule.
1800000	1802000	Woo!
1802000	1804000	Right, this is the furthest I've ever got.
1804000	1806000	Don't mess up now.
1806000	1808000	Okay.
1808000	1810000	I need a breather, honestly.
1810000	1812000	Right, I'm just going to keep going.
1812000	1814000	Oh my god!
1814000	1816000	Why is that so hard?
1816000	1818000	Oh, that's TNT!
1818000	1820000	Wee!
1820000	1822000	That's more TNT!
1822000	1824000	They explode!
1824000	1826000	Okay, we did it.
1826000	1828000	Oh, gee willikers, I sure hope we don't have to do
1828000	1830000	that segment again, because, uh,
1830000	1832000	what the heck? Why is that so hard?
1832000	1834000	I literally have no double jump open.
1834000	1836000	You should try jumping over them.
1838000	1840000	Taming matters.
1840000	1842000	What's this?
1842000	1844000	Oh, a platform?
1844000	1846000	I don't have access to it.
1846000	1848000	Golly, you scared me.
1848000	1850000	Oh my god, it's discord nature!
1852000	1854000	Is this...
1854000	1856000	What does that do?
1856000	1858000	Okay, well,
1858000	1860000	I remember what it does now.
1860000	1862000	Wait, can I do this?
1862000	1864000	Oh.
1864000	1866000	Go away, you're so creepy!
1866000	1868000	What are you?
1868000	1870000	Oh, bonus time, bonus time!
1870000	1872000	That's what it does.
1872000	1874000	Yeah.
1874000	1876000	Don't touch the nature.
1876000	1878000	No discord daddies.
1878000	1880000	Or no discord groomers in the velar.
1882000	1884000	Good luck.
1884000	1886000	Wow.
1888000	1890000	Bence?
1890000	1892000	Bounce?
1892000	1894000	Oh my god, I get free life.
1894000	1896000	Well, I definitely needed that after how...
1896000	1898000	Oh!
1898000	1900000	He just scooted.
1900000	1902000	Why is he so slow when he crouches though?
1904000	1906000	Okay, I like the bonus distance.
1906000	1908000	Where's the key?
1908000	1910000	Try to tap crouch
1910000	1912000	when walking to get faster.
1912000	1914000	Tap crouch while walking.
1916000	1918000	Oh, every hundred apples,
1918000	1920000	I get a life.
1920000	1922000	Ah, those things are so scary.
1922000	1924000	For a duke.
1924000	1926000	Exclamation mark.
1928000	1930000	What the heck did I just do?
1930000	1932000	Oh no, I was supposed to jump.
1932000	1934000	I missed the jump.
1934000	1936000	Oopsies, I was supposed to jump on top of them.
1936000	1938000	Oh good.
1940000	1942000	I don't like this camera angle.
1942000	1944000	No, this is why I didn't like the camera angle.
1944000	1946000	It felt like I was going to get chased again.
1946000	1948000	Okay, give me the checkpoint at least.
1952000	1954000	Oh, there's...
1954000	1956000	Gate the way up.
1956000	1958000	Oh no!
1958000	1960000	What was that?
1960000	1962000	Crash?
1962000	1964000	Did you just stand on lava and let me win?
1964000	1966000	Oh my god, the game feels so bad for me.
1966000	1968000	That is letting me win.
1968000	1970000	It feels so bad for me.
1970000	1972000	Please don't slow me down.
1972000	1974000	Oh my god, get me out of here.
1974000	1976000	Oh, get me out of here.
1976000	1978000	I'm not playing this level again.
1978000	1980000	Wampa Fruits, they're wampas.
1980000	1982000	Oh my god, the game felt so bad
1982000	1984000	it let me walk on lava.
1986000	1988000	Oh, that came up more.
1988000	1990000	Honestly, me right now.
1990000	1992000	Did I do four there?
1992000	1994000	Yes, I did. Right, we're not playing that one again.
1994000	1996000	That one was stinky. We're doing five.
1996000	1998000	We're doing...
1998000	2000000	Oh, Coco!
2000000	2002000	What's this one?
2002000	2004000	It's me.
2006000	2008000	Eh?
2008000	2010000	To accelerate, right trigger.
2010000	2012000	There's no backwards.
2012000	2014000	Oh my god, it's so wobbly, wobbly.
2014000	2016000	Whee!
2016000	2018000	Jump shot.
2018000	2020000	Wah!
2020000	2022000	Yoo-hoo!
2022000	2024000	Oh my god, this is...
2024000	2026000	Oh, there's a bomba.
2026000	2028000	Wait, wait, let me get the bomb.
2028000	2030000	Oh, 360.
2030000	2032000	That's okay. 360!
2032000	2034000	She's actually doing spins.
2034000	2036000	I'm not doing any input for her
2036000	2038000	to do those spins, by the way.
2038000	2040000	I'm just jumping on it.
2040000	2042000	Oh, there's bombas!
2042000	2044000	Bomba!
2048000	2050000	Oh no, I've only got seven lives.
2050000	2052000	Oh well, I just regained a new one.
2052000	2054000	Okay.
2054000	2056000	This is a child's game. Children can play this.
2056000	2058000	So I can play this.
2058000	2060000	I'm wise enough to play a child's game.
2060000	2062000	Surely.
2062000	2064000	Surely I won't have to run out of lives.
2064000	2066000	If I play at the same level
2066000	2068000	over and over,
2068000	2070000	Dad just gets infinite lives.
2070000	2072000	Because we might have to farm lives
2072000	2074000	unironically.
2074000	2076000	Right, hold on. What's going on here?
2076000	2078000	No. Yes.
2078000	2080000	Yes. Okay, we made it and we're going to get this checkpoint.
2080000	2082000	Wah!
2082000	2084000	Eh, excuse me.
2084000	2086000	I said we're going to get this checkpoint.
2086000	2088000	Oh my god.
2088000	2090000	It's edging me right now.
2090000	2092000	Wah!
2092000	2094000	Oh, that was close. That was close.
2094000	2096000	I was a bit too close for comfort.
2096000	2098000	Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2098000	2100000	Timon's going to be fine. It's fine.
2100000	2102000	Oh, there's a seagull!
2102000	2104000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2104000	2106000	Slow it down. Slow it down.
2106000	2108000	Slow and steady.
2108000	2110000	When's the race?
2110000	2112000	Then you need to go 100 miles per minute.
2112000	2114000	Wah!
2114000	2116000	Honestly.
2116000	2118000	Good game.
2118000	2120000	I am going to drop into the bomb.
2120000	2122000	But I didn't because I'm so
2122000	2124000	emotional at this child's game.
2124000	2126000	Wah!
2126000	2128000	Oh, there's two bombs. That's cheeky.
2128000	2130000	The devs did that for a reason.
2130000	2132000	They knew I was going to be greedy
2132000	2134000	and go for the bomba.
2134000	2136000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2136000	2138000	Hello?
2138000	2140000	Okay. Holy crap.
2140000	2142000	I was like, can I even go near that
2142000	2144000	wall?
2144000	2146000	Steady, easy, easy.
2146000	2148000	Take it easy.
2148000	2150000	Steady.
2150000	2152000	I'd say someone steady when's the race.
2152000	2154000	But sometimes, sometimes you got to
2154000	2156000	just send it and get out of here.
2156000	2158000	Oh my god.
2158000	2160000	Oh, this is so good.
2160000	2162000	Who suggested this game?
2162000	2164000	Congrats on you if you suggested it.
2164000	2166000	Just kidding. I picked it
2166000	2168000	because it's a childhood game.
2168000	2170000	Okay.
2170000	2172000	Okay.
2172000	2174000	The boss fight.
2174000	2176000	Oh, no.
2176000	2178000	Tiny Tiger.
2178000	2180000	Oh, no.
2180000	2182000	I'm not going to get perished by a boss.
2182000	2184000	Crash.
2184000	2186000	Crash.
2196000	2198000	Sometimes he has...
2198000	2200000	Oh, no.
2200000	2202000	Oh, the music is banging, though.
2204000	2206000	Oh!
2206000	2208000	Oh, no.
2214000	2216000	MonkaS?
2216000	2218000	MonkaS? What'd I do?
2218000	2220000	MonkaS, MonkaS, MonkaS, MonkaS.
2220000	2222000	Ah!
2222000	2224000	Please leave me alone.
2224000	2226000	Oh my god, he's got J's on like me.
2227000	2229000	Spank.
2229000	2231000	Okay. It's fine.
2231000	2233000	One and three.
2233000	2235000	What does that mean?
2235000	2237000	What does that mean?
2237000	2239000	There's Tigers!
2241000	2243000	I'm to avoid...
2243000	2245000	everything?
2249000	2251000	What?
2251000	2253000	I'm to avoid all those Tigers?
2253000	2255000	Spank
2255000	2257000	And then Tigers, right? We can do this.
2257000	2259000	We can do this.
2259000	2261000	Okay. Take your time.
2261000	2263000	Uh-huh.
2263000	2265000	Uh-huh.
2265000	2267000	Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.
2267000	2269000	Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.
2269000	2271000	Okay. Okay. I just got a little caught up in this.
2271000	2273000	The last one.
2273000	2275000	Okay. Just keep running.
2275000	2277000	Just keep running. Just keep running.
2277000	2279000	Just keep running. Spank!
2279000	2281000	And then we do it all over again.
2281000	2283000	Okay.
2283000	2286000	Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
2286000	2288000	Let's go. This is so much faster
2288000	2290000	than the second phase.
2290000	2292000	But that's okay!
2292000	2294000	Okay.
2294000	2296000	Okay. Okay. Okay. Just keep running.
2296000	2298000	Just keep running around.
2298000	2300000	He'll come to me.
2300000	2302000	We did it. We're doing it. We're doing it.
2302000	2304000	We're doing it. We're doing it.
2304000	2306000	Spank! Oh, we did it!
2306000	2308000	What did we get?
2308000	2310000	What is this?
2310000	2312000	Boo! Tomato! Tomato!
2312000	2314000	Boo!
2314000	2316000	Beat him while he's down! Beat him while he's down!
2316000	2318000	Argh!
2318000	2320000	Take this.
2320000	2322000	Okay. What is this?
2322000	2324000	Supercharged body slam
2324000	2326000	for a more professional belly flop.
2326000	2328000	Press A and B
2328000	2330000	to the top of the jump.
2334000	2336000	Please! I love this so much!
2336000	2338000	Oh, that's so good.
2338000	2340000	I love it.
2340000	2342000	Momay domination.
2342000	2344000	Dang straight.
2344000	2346000	Dang straight!
2346000	2348000	Well done, children.
2348000	2350000	By defeating Tiny,
2350000	2353000	you have unlocked the gate to the next time travel area.
2353000	2355000	Go back to the center of this time, Trister,
2355000	2357000	and save your progress if you wish.
2357000	2359000	From there, you will see
2359000	2362000	that the gate to the second time travel area
2362000	2364000	is now open.
2364000	2367000	Okay. Thank you.
2367000	2369000	Okay.
2369000	2371000	Okay, so I've unlocked everything in this one.
2371000	2373000	In the castle segment.
2373000	2375000	How do I save the game?
2375000	2377000	Left trigger, save.
2377000	2379000	Uh, sure.
2379000	2381000	Oh, auto-save is already active.
2381000	2383000	That's fine.
2383000	2385000	Yeah, just save that though.
2385000	2387000	Yeah, okay.
2387000	2389000	Just in case.
2389000	2391000	What is this?
2391000	2393000	So we've got Arabia,
2393000	2395000	China,
2395000	2397000	Egypt,
2397000	2399000	the future,
2399000	2401000	South Korea then,
2401000	2403000	for the future.
2403000	2405000	Are you squidding me right now?
2405000	2407000	Tiny, Spiny!
2407000	2409000	I would just like to formally say that I,
2409000	2411000	Tiny, Spiny, am not associated with
2411000	2413000	Tiny, Tiny in any way,
2413000	2415000	and do not endorse his actions.
2415000	2417000	No.
2417000	2419000	Way to go with the game so far.
2419000	2421000	It's going so good.
2421000	2423000	I love it.
2423000	2425000	Thank you for the five gifted memberships.
2425000	2427000	Congrats to those who caught it with your face.
2427000	2429000	It means you get access to the moots.
2429000	2431000	I'm going to very quickly grab a can of cola.
2431000	2433000	I'll be literally in those seconds
2433000	2435000	because I couldn't finish my tea,
2435000	2437000	so I'll just get cola.
2437000	2439000	Surely we can't be no weak to me at all.
2439000	2441000	Sure.
2453000	2455000	My question,
2455000	2457000	briefly,
2457000	2459000	is surely not all commissions are that short
2459000	2461000	because there's only five locations.
2461000	2463000	And if there's only five locations,
2465000	2467000	I don't...
2467000	2469000	I think they were going to be finished with Game in two hours
2469000	2471000	and redirect him into Sheevie
2471000	2473000	because there's no way.
2473000	2475000	Thank you for the gifted membership
2475000	2477000	for Jinger, and thank you for
2477000	2479000	the tip, Tiny, Spiny,
2479000	2481000	if.
2481000	2483000	They're short, but you'll die a lot.
2483000	2485000	What happens if I get zero lives?
2485000	2487000	Like, I genuinely lose?
2487000	2489000	This is called
2489000	2491000	G-Wiz
2491000	2493000	and...
2511000	2513000	It deletes your save file?
2513000	2515000	Am I being trolled right now?
2515000	2517000	Or did I genuinely lose all progress?
2517000	2519000	Because this is an old game
2519000	2521000	and that's exactly what old games did.
2521000	2523000	They make you lose your...
2523000	2525000	Whoa.
2525000	2527000	Go back to the farm!
2527000	2529000	Go back to the farm!

2553000	2555000	decimated that poor man.
2557000	2559000	It's not that old.
2559000	2561000	You just lose your score and start from your latest level.
2561000	2563000	Oh!
2563000	2565000	A game over. The player is given the option to either restart the game
2565000	2567000	from the beginning of the level.
2567000	2574680	kind of with the standard number of lives for or to quit to the title screen okay so I don't lose

6283040	6288600	getting yourself into this time you've done it
6291600	6303040	Entropy there's usually a special hundred percent completion and then jump what

6391920	6405040	think that only remember Coco okay okay okay right this time don't let the
6405040	6418280	missile go to my head so that'd be great okay wow I almost jumped into that

6481560	6488760	trying to guilt truck was into losing who knows what it'll do oh no right we're
6488760	6492960	back to being a lady because we did the general mission okay we're going to Egypt

6544380	6552740	okay that was terrible tabin can we get like a crossbow maybe okay let's try
6552740	6556780	that again I don't know when I was supposed to jump for him angle ah maybe
6556780	6560220	Maybe I was supposed to double jump over the flames, right?
6560220	6571420	You, and then a mummy, okay, that's fine, return the slime, watching you play this makes me
6571420	6578540	want to get a spiral, I've never played spiral but people were recommending it and I was like
6578540	6584940	I might give it a shot, give me checkpoint please but let the doors close first because I was 100%
6584940	6599820	gonna fall for that, hold on, I want the spikes up, okay, all right I'm safe to go on it for the
6599820	6612380	section which is fine, that sarcophagus is making some, you're scaring me, I like how it
6612460	6619020	pings off onto like some of the items to break them for you, oh god I'm so bad at this one,
6619020	6633340	double jump, okay, we need to wait, spiral is also fun, yeah spiral and crash bandicoot can I get,
6634460	6638620	are they by like the same developers or was it just they happened to come out
6639500	6648540	kind of closely the same time, right what did I do wrong here again, I had nothing to protect me,
6651260	6655100	I'm wondering if I have more time if I do that, oh wow I do, right,
6657500	6663420	and let me guess that doesn't explode the T, oh no it does, I was gonna be like oh let me guess it
6663500	6677420	doesn't do anything, again, oh no, oh we're struggling with this one,
6680940	6687420	goodness gravy, am I making this look easy, no sorry am I making this look hard,
6687900	6696300	right and then wait for it to come back and then jump on it and then defeat the mummy twice
6698220	6708780	or the sarcophagi, jeez, let's try this again, right and then I can just double jump here
6708780	6714700	because I'm out of range and then he's gonna drop that which explodes that one first just fine with
6714700	6726060	me, right don't send it, don't send it reflings, if you ever replay this game don't send it at
6726060	6731020	that section because that's what I thought I had to do there and it did not pay off, I need to wait
6731020	6737820	until he spawns the second blow, we'll get there it just takes me a few moments, can't believe it
6737820	6745740	they made me flat, the lollipop model confirmed first Ronnie, right again just jump over this
6745740	6751260	which is fine, oh there's not even TNT this time the game said yeah you're struggling, right send it
6751260	6756780	send it send it send it right and you would work if I sent it, oh I've got a checkpoint goodness
6757900	6765420	that'll be very welcomed I assure you, there's really enemies behind this, yeah there's freaking
6765420	6785980	TNT, oh take your time, take your time, there will be a mummy, okay we're good, we're good, we're
6785980	6794860	doing it, we're doing it, we are doing it, oh why would they randomly have a natural there
6797260	6804220	oh oh send it send it send it send it, I like how he just looks at me as if I'm not about to
6804220	6821820	kablamo him, uh this seems suspiciously easy, rather this is suspiciously, oh wait hold on, oh
6821820	6831100	crystal let's go on the bonus map, don't send it no idea I'm literally giving you the strats live
6831100	6839580	because uh I'm struggling, okay there's lots of TNT, I'll just let it pop and then run away again

8742300	8748620	okay the AI can actually go off road which is interesting I didn't know that
8749740	8757420	the AI is adapting and I'm getting nervous why are they oh and I missed it again
8759260	8765100	I'm fourth place honestly that wasn't awful I'm wondering right we'll keep doing it we'll
8765100	8768620	keep doing it we'll keep doing it that was the first time I played the map and the first thing
8768620	8776540	I did was fall off okay reeflings are always thrilled to princess carry me honestly I just wish

8784940	8792700	on the left side there is already an issue so the AI is actually choosing to go off the map
8792780	8798140	which is curious I didn't think the AI did such a thing
8800460	8805180	very curious indeed yeah they're all avoid in the polis
8807740	8813420	so just take it easy these corners didn't do so yeah I didn't do so hot in these corners
8814060	8821180	wow I'll take that boost though I'll take that boost thank you

11445340	11449260	here all week dear mommy oh i did beat that one
11458620	11467260	oh wow someone's analizing my ovulation cycle so a normal ovulation cycle lasts about 24 hours
11467260	11472860	each month this is correct once an egg is released from an ovary it will dissolve within 12 to 24 hours
11473820	11477980	if it's not fertilized and the window is about a week before ovulation since it survives for
11477980	11485580	almost a week so basically if i was trying to fertilize you i would need to do it the day before
11485580	11492540	for optimum success chance which means the 13th of the month i'll refling you went gen 2 already
11493420	11497580	you missed your window of opportunity you're gonna have to try again next month with me huh
11498380	11501820	and we'll just keep trying and trying and trying

12054300	12064460	gonna try and get them banned no i think we'll be okay we're gonna use our euphemisms where i go
12064460	12076380	tentacle and ink and i want to ink on the tentacle because we're cuttlefish out here we're cephalopods
12076940	12082940	but together we're a cephalopog because we're so cool like that yeah pogger
12085020	12093020	um have i ever heard about the gates by asa rock i'm so sorry i've never heard of that in my
12093020	12100700	life we're all stuck in perigatory keep that in mind because there may or may not be a collab
12100700	12106140	with a va and all villa members that is related to purgatory so keep that in mind
12108220	12116140	funny you brought a funny you brought that up yeah um imagine pieta but it's the virgin marie
12116140	12121500	given jesus whoa we we can't be saying that stuff out loud those are inside thoughts
12121580	12127900	so oh sounds interesting yeah you better be excited
12129740	12137900	i like when strony spoils i try my best i do i the dust is definitely settling on my list of
12137900	12146940	stuff to do like a lot of things are becoming a lot easier um and it's getting to the point where i
12146940	12157180	can fully be strummer yes i can be strummer um i i wouldn't mind having a clip manager but sadly um
12158620	12169340	i don't have anyone um i trust to be in that position um because clip manager needs access
12169340	12173900	to the girls accounts to see what people have been clipping and it ain't gonna happen so
12174620	12179580	unfortunately i am still clip manager at this point in time but it's not too bad because literally
12179580	12183500	i just take a clip and then i send it to editor then editor comes back and then i upload it on
12183500	12192300	girls channel and it's all hunky dory stop problem strummer i like when strony you didn't finish your
12192300	12202300	sentence mommy protecting her doors yes um i will be your shield i know not a lot you play
12202300	12208620	Overwatch i used to play it quite a lot sadly i fell out of love with it um when Overwatch 2 came
12208620	12220620	out but uh there is a girl called Brigitte Lentol and her slogan is i will be your shield and yes
12220620	12229740	i am Brigitte for my gen mates because i don't want anything happening to them um so i'm the i
12229740	12238300	am both the owl and the shield i love when strony does anything yes uh tomorrow's stream
12238300	12247500	i'm gonna see if i can get my heart rate monitor working um so i should be able to do that and
12247500	12252620	then you can see my heart rate during buckshot roulette i didn't manage to watch any more
12252620	12260700	cultural content because i literally i finished stream i did i see an me's memberships and then
12261500	12267180	then what would i do i don't know um and then i went on twitter i think i liked one thing and
12267180	12275260	then passed out and then i woke up like 45 minutes before stream i probably needed a big
12275260	12279500	sleep like that like it was coming it was coming that i needed a sleep like that
12280060	12286700	strony that was the whole scene wait what was the scene that's the whole scene
12288140	12295580	i also like when strony i do like when strony but why are clips private i don't know youtube
12295580	12303820	doesn't let people see what people have clipped on uh livestream or any content really if it was
12303820	12310460	public then i could get a clip master but i can't get a clip master because they're not public
12311340	12317100	but hopefully youtube changes that in a couple of months because that would then negate me even
12317100	12325180	needing to be a clip master um and then i can spend even more time we're briefly wait they're not
12326060	12332780	do you remember sending marshmallows to the girls i remember completely crashing on yesterday's
12332780	12338780	stream for anyone who wasn't watching the runescape stream i hit the 11 hour mark and became
12339340	12345100	delirious i spilled all my chips on the floor when i ended stream and i just left them until
12345100	12354780	this morning to clean up eat i was gone with the wind i i don't know what happened i ate food
12354780	12361820	and i was like oh this will wake me up this will wake me up no it freaking didn't day one day we'll
12361820	12370940	hit 12 hours for old school runescape honestly um no i didn't have any issues with it playing it but
12370940	12376620	i like completely crashed the ending of the stream was so funny i just remember being like oh let me
12376620	12381820	send the girl some marshmallows and then i started typing and i don't really remember what the contents
12381820	12390860	of it were but hopefully all is good um but yeah i remember just drinking losing it basically
12391580	12396940	i crashed way before that part of stream you used up all your energy trying to win connect for
12396940	12402460	unironically oh my god you if you didn't see runescape stream quick recap in runescape you
12402460	12412460	can play connect for i was getting decimated like the reeflings were like ganging up on me just
12412460	12419260	fucking one at a time one after the other like bro i just accepted my fate i could not win at connect
12419980	12427420	one i won one because i tried so hard and burnt my brain the second one i won by accident because
12427420	12434940	a reefling couldn't see what i was doing um i was gonna absolutely destroy yeah i remember my
12434940	12443100	sleep fading and then some strange noises coming up um sounds like a fun time bro i was perishing
12443740	12448220	i don't know what happened because normally i can last 12 hours and i had an eight hour sleep
12448220	12454300	before it but my brain oh my stomach just made a noise have you heard that my brain just perished
12454300	12460380	like it had enough it was like i'm sorry i can't hold out anymore checkers oh no i'm not playing
12460380	12465740	checkers again that was the most confusing thing i couldn't even bro we were playing checkers and i
12465740	12474780	couldn't even move on the board because i didn't know what was like going on um with the dang thing
12474780	12481340	it was a redonkiller hold on i'm just gonna pin the marshmallow oh my god that's me
12481820	12491420	that sounds like that q and a i say q and a is if we don't just like that's not the q and a
12491420	12499100	length hold on a minute that's the that's what the reefling said wait a minute who are you

12512300	12517100	q and a is that it's just you guys being lovely to me and then i go in a ramble and i see how lovely

12610060	12616780	for me um but there seems to be quite a lot of fans that are distraught at the reveal because
12616780	12622860	they don't like it but i thought it was just uh i think why do we hate brazil no it's a meme
12623500	12629020	where it's like oh come to brazil do a concert in brazil but brazil's really dangerous for foreigners
12629020	12636140	we don't actually hate brazil hi starney i agree with that one riff riefling when you rage i always

12723340	12731900	models for i did take into account what the girls went for but when i heard the girls voices

12882620	12888140	couldn't do the watch longs but uh methos tal seemed to be kind of already leaning on the
12888140	12894940	alternative side which makes me quite comfortable with them as creators as for actual corporation
12895740	12903100	tubers uh i'm just if the person's happy with me i'm happy with them i never want to encroach
12903100	12908140	myself on someone and that's not the word at all i agree with those other two reef flings need
12908140	12919020	mummy to take all that rage out of my tentacle until it's ink to dry oh my god um mummy if one

13112860	13122300	ensuing um i do ah what's that game um it's hard because there's not a lot of six-man games so i
13122300	13128700	think it might have to be stuff like among us or lethal company i know residency for everyone
13128700	13133580	plays it but the problem is there's six of us there were many i think there's a back rooms game
13133580	13141740	that we can play together possibly um i do want to do monthly six-man collabs but after that um
13141740	13148220	it will be like two on two collabs maybe three three collabs angry scottish drunk karaoke went
13148220	13159740	soon i was gonna do a drunk karaoke um on um i don't know when i don't know when um but i was
13159740	13165660	going to do it on a weekend so like you guys can you know work work hard and then get all the relief
13165660	13173340	on the weekend and we get steamboats and all that when the talents are sourced jackbox would be great
13173340	13179900	but just with only one pop so you don't have to stream discord yes i am open to doing that um shebe
13180540	13185340	when we were first meeting for the first time i got the girls to play a game together and we
13185340	13189820	played jackbox and we all got addicted and we're like stuck i was like because it was only supposed
13189820	13195020	to be like a one hour icebreaker so the girls could get used to like each other because like from my
13195020	13199820	pov i knew the girls like i had consumed their content i knew kind of about them who they are
13199900	13205420	how they kind of are and all that jazz um and then we ended up playing for like two hours and i'm
13205420	13209660	like oh i'm so sorry like i didn't mean to steal all the time but then like it went two hours and a
13209660	13216300	half um in poor ac's tame zone i picked a really bad tame zone so she was so tired but she was
13216300	13223580	having so much fun she didn't want to get off um which was so cute and cute and good which says
13223580	13230540	cute if you put it dictionary oh we we're gonna possibly do a dictionary there's a new jackbox
13230540	13237820	18 that's released um okay i was gonna say i'm not sure we can hmm but we had fun on jackbox
13237820	13244620	it was so mean against ac though because english isn't her first language and one of the game modes
13244620	13250540	was like asking all these really like hard questions like even english speakers can't get it i felt so
13250540	13257820	bad for her and she kept like dying in the game i felt so bad um i see no one to get off that's
13257820	13264780	definitely not true whoa did i say that's in it deep rock galactica has a more players mod

13531260	13537020	basically and i came back and i'm strongy i've always been strongy i've never been any other
13537020	13547100	vtuber for legal reasons um and yeah now now it's going good it's fantastic um i did like iron mouse
13547100	13554860	because she's sick as a dog um but like keep streaming anyway uh definitely you can always
13554860	13560460	kind of lend some energy when you hear stories about like people against all odds like you

13568460	13579020	robot yeah i keep saying it like tisker like a noise you make when dying what noise that make

13610380	13618060	emotes um yeah eh i'm not supposed to do that hold on a minute uh but yeah i do it anyway because

13643980	13647500	you're gonna have to let me start digesting producing it first before i can answer these
13647500	13651580	kind of questions um i'm staying away from the permanent stuff because it makes me a bit nervous
13651580	13657980	doing any permanent effects stuff but i already have a public release audio that will undo any
13657980	13663020	effects i may or may not do on you what did you ask me in particular reinforcement loop for triggers
13663820	13671660	for triggers um mine's double finger snaps i like it um the most but i will train you in it okay
13672380	13680380	i am bar i'm embarrassed to admit but i inked to your clapping with no hands and the party role

13686460	13695580	bit of my heart into that i like that okay i'll enjoy how it came out um hi strawnee how do you
13695580	13707100	feel about male figurines being used in bibbute videos yeah you can do that um but maybe maybe
13707100	13719900	in the future you can use official veiler merch association figurines that's not something i
13720140	13726460	need a fixation oh i got five at 10 i got seven i got nine at 10 i like the transparency though
13726460	13730540	because you're just a normal person at the end of the day yeah actually can i say something
13730540	13737420	that's really disrespectful and i mean no disrespect when i say it you know those vtuber's that have
13737420	13742940	those donations where like items get thrown at the vtuber model when they get a donation and then the
13742940	13753900	vtuber goes like the the every time i consume any of that i this is very disrespectful and i don't
13753900	13760380	mean it this way it makes me cringe to think that they're in a room on their own with the iphone
13760380	13773580	tracking them and going i'm so sorry i'm like actually so sorry for me for me it's a no but
13773580	13778620	people find it entertaining which is really cute i like that people can get so entertained and so
13779420	13787500	enveloped um that it's humorous so i do apologize to anyone that i made him uh i think yeah i've seen
13787580	13795180	it too twitch integrated throwing system oh okay is that what it's called and yeah and here you are
13795180	13801900	veiler figures that well adjusted people could be normal don't think about it harder it makes the
13801900	13808140	cringe yeah i remember seeing a clip about it and i was like don't get me wrong i'm a cringe fest if
13808140	13814780	you sit through one stream of mine but i remember seeing it and i was like oh that's rough that's
13814860	13821740	rough even for me to digest but i mean absolutely no disrespect when i say that like whatever
13821740	13828780	works for you works for you some people are balls to the wall in immersion and that's fantastic
13828780	13834780	for me um i am absolutely in love that reeflings are in love with pilot in america it makes me
13834780	13842380	incredibly comfortable um like streaming and acknowledging like oh i need to only go put my
13842380	13851100	boots on uh instead of like being like i love you so much feeling like bro ain't no one here for that
13851100	13857180	well some people might be here for that but me i'm not here for that you know um
13860220	13866140	yeah it's basically just beautiful but i don't mind like the roleplay like if i had a 3d model or
13866140	13871740	i'll be roleplaying at the wazoo so i'm probably gonna be hypocritical with that statement it's
13871740	13877740	not even a statement it's just me blabbering any blabberers the heart eyes yeah i love that my
13877740	13883660	heart eyes are so different like oh my god my squiddles where'd my squiddly pupils go give me my
13883660	13898380	squiddly pupils back wait wait wait wait hold on you ready for this you ready for this oh wait no
