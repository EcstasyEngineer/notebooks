1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Oh wait, how do you fit me in life?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I don't know what to pop it, ah good morning, I see it, it says I'm up, I'm sorry I'm up,

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:29,000
good morning, good evening, good afternoon, we've learned, hiya, America, hiya, hiya,

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I literally just woke up right, and then I quickly scrolled Twitter whilst I've got like

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
literally one thirty seconds to my name after like booting up the stream and everything

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and Emmys like, wait actually you know what, I can freaking quote it and I can let you listen to

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
hold on let's find, oh my god I don't have any DMs with Emmys on Twitter, oh my god proof that there's

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
inciting at me allure, right are you ready for this, her most recent tweet that I just saw,

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
wow I'm so happy I'm not three hours into a shift at the cash register dealing with old people

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
complaining that the newspaper got ten cent more expensive, I love my job, also Emmys

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
get pregnant, get pregnant, get pregnant, get pregnant, get fucking pregnant you precious little slut, get pregnant

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:25,000
yeah, damn straight you love your job either one, we're playing Wata Melan

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and I love the Wata Melan meme, no the meme is not overused is I had email notifications on and just got here

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I hide them for hours playing Suika or Suika or Suikobliat

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:47,000
so yeah, I have email notifications on I'm still late, why would you have email notifications on, that's so curse

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
but I feel okay today please don't worry, I looked at Marshmallow, I'm so sorry for worrying anyone

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I did not, I've never played this game before, no

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I am so sorry for stressing anyone out, I'm gonna quickly read the super chats I missed yesterday

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Sada, thank you for the extended membership and their message was face

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
like the capital D face

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Veeler Lover, how the hell can she be a tease when she's still out of breath

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
because on my dying breath I will be a tease

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Nero2276, thank you for the super chat, is this the bite of Vsucky?

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
is this the bite of 87?

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
good reference, anonymous

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I've once heard that females can have miniature inking from work out, this is true

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Stony's panting sounds like she's recording an audio, no no no

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
it is true, women can experience a floor firework if you will, a floor muscle firework

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
thank you for that tip anonymous and then anonymous said good job mami

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
good job Riflin, you did amazing, now give us

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
now give us you a nice little, oh massage all over your body, I'll take it honestly

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm ironically a bit small, small, so are

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
but today we are testing if in fact it's true or not

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
if this game truly has VTubers in a chokehold

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
jesus, that's blind and first thing in the morning, can we change?

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Aladdin, Prince of the Fabulous, he's drowning in water

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I do not know the words

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
can we stop blinding myself, oh my god can you load faster

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I thought this was like a tiny little indie game, honestly

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
are you squidding me right now?

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
thank you for the super chat really legend

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
so what I'm hearing is I have to look for a VOD, if you'd like to

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
okay first off cute adorable, Kawaii-nee

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
mm-hmm, mm-hmm, okay

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
single player plays, well that's the only option I've got

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
apparently the DLC's behind the paywall

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
are you squidding me right now?

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
still didn't even have the fill thing, I'm not kidding

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I've got a cup of tea to wake me up

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
oh my god reeflings

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
reeflings, I have something that I need to keep for you guys

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
only you guys are allowed to know this

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
don't leak it anywhere or I can't keep leaking stuff

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I found artwork of someone that like drew

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
that draws feet, right?

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
okay

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and I commissioned them to draw everyone's feet in the allure

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
okay and I was so fucking excited to get that

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
turned down the game I think a bit

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
anonymous, thank you for the tip

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
hi story, I can't believe you and Emmy are going back and forth with our no-

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
no, no, no, no, Emmy's first

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I bet it would be fun to see pinpals versus re-

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
no, no, no, no, no, no, no

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
that's not how, personally that's not how I do it

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I actually want the girls to be ahead of me

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I've kind of said this before

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I've put advertisement money behind the girls

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
but I've not done it myself

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
the only exception was the trailer

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
because all of us for debut had to generate some kind of hype

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and unfortunately Shibi and Azura's big fat yunkers

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
stopped their ads from running on their trailer

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
which is quite upsetting

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
but I personally do not do it like that

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I am not here to outdo my genmys

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I actually want them all to succeed

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and be ahead of me

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
so when Emmy went ahead

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I was absolutely ecstatic

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I truly was ecstatic

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and she's still ahead

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
which I'm very happy about Shibi

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I've given an ASMR script too

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
which she will be recording

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
soon to end

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
when she's not at her grand-pappy

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
parents house

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I think that's where she is

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
boobs

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm trying to draw, I saw you draw Emmy too

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm okay

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
is your sweat toggle still on?

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
it is!

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
thank you Reefling

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I couldn't see that

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
thank you Reefling

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
oh my god I'm such a professional streamer

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I also managed to get my order changed

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
before it came through

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
so the dog bowl and the dog collar

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
are gonna say the right things

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't know how you noticed that

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
from so far away

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I would have played the entire game sweating

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
literally

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I hope you liked my silly drawing

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
are you joking? I'm yonking at making ASMR

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
right, how to play Suika

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
use the

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
yes

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
or up and down to move

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
no we're not doing up and down that's terrible

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
we'll use the less stick

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
next press the A button to drop the fruit

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
uhhhh

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
okay I guess

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I didn't read the rest of the thing

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
right

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
okay

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
hold on

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm just getting used to the mechanics

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
if you will

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
okay

125
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
hold on let me get up let me get up

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
let me go up

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
so this is what had VTubers

128
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
in a choke hold for how long

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
this

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
am I addicted yet

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
the answer sadly is no

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm not I'm not sure if I'm gonna get addicted

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm unsure

134
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I have yet to form an opinion on such a game

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
what's going on here it still has a

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
choke hold on VTubers does it actually

137
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
well I see

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
someone very

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I think someone might have

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
gone on her throne and got her switch

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I said to her

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
oh I'm playing this game

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and I'll recommend it to you

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
ooh we got a lemon

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll recommend it to you if you're

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
wanting

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
recommendations because I'm trying to help her pick a few games

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
that are more her style

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
oh fuck that one up

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
oops

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
so I need what pray that

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
they're just gonna randomly touch each other

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
okay I guess

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
oh no I can't reach the orange one

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
over the mandarin

156
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
oh god I think I'm like

157
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
really I think I'm screwing this up

158
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
sorry wait hold on a minute

159
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm messing this up so badly

160
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
oopsies I still loving

161
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
what kind of games do I see

162
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I see needs a casual experience

163
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and no I don't mean that and then

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
so do you

165
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
relax

166
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I just mean that I see likes a game

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I don't have to swear on

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
okay or is a familiar game so I'm putting the list together

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I didn't mean competing against

170
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
oh sorry anonymous I apologize

171
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I did not mean to paint your

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
tip in that light my apologies that was my fault

173
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I just think it would be fun

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
to make a challenge of viewer fans

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
just like Emmy did were pin pals so everyone can

176
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
get ahead of you

177
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
did she tell you the challenge she did

178
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
yes there's actually

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
this is inside her knowledge

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
fucking strongy stop leaking inside

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
your knowledge challenge impossible

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I am going to do a meet and

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
oh I got you a pink thing

184
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
what's a pink fruit

185
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
that's that big a melon

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
maybe there's a pink melon

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
but it's not the water melon

188
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
um

189
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm literally impossible

190
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
for me not to leak in company secrets

191
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
it's just a big peach oh it's a peach

192
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
it's my booty

193
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
fuck you booty fuck you bitch

194
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
um sorry that was

195
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I think that's a meme of some kind

196
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
um

197
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I am not strategically playing this game

198
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I actually don't know what I'm doing

199
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm just having a good time okay

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
no touch yay

201
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
oh you can touch

202
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
touch touch yes yes

203
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
oh my god okay hold on a minute

204
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
hold on a minute hold on a minute

205
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I think I'm starting to understand

206
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
again VTubers I might

207
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
have to issue a public apology

208
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I might have to

209
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
issue on a public apology hold on

210
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
a minute

211
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I might have to do it

212
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
um right okay company secrets

213
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
getting leaked in 4k

214
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm having a meeting with the girls

215
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
and I'm telling them like hey this method

216
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
seemed to really work for me so if you

217
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
want to offer free audios

218
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
on Twitter in exchange for like

219
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
milestones I'm happy with that

220
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
like I have so much ASMR

221
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
debt and audio debt

222
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
on Twitter coming up but once

223
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
it's finished like I might

224
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
do something like that and be like

225
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
oh for I don't even know how many

226
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
for 15k subscribers I'll do this

227
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
outrageous thing okay see now I'm

228
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
starting to block myself

229
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm not really

230
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
sure what to do

231
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I mean I'll just go for it I mean

232
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
it's alright it's just a fun little

233
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
goofy game it's actually

234
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
oh no oh no this can't be right

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
go move over please

236
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
no

237
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
yes oh well I didn't

238
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
expect that one to move actually

239
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
oh we got the pitch

240
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
oh

241
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
head empty drop that motherfucking

242
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
boot

243
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
apology arc inbound already I prefer

244
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
the company leaks in the form of puzzles

245
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
okay I'll keep that in mind

246
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
okay I'm gonna say something

247
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
there may or there may not be

248
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
a very high quality artwork

249
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I purchased for the 10th

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
10,000 subscriber milestone

251
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
so once all the girls hit 10,000

252
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
subscribers there may or may not

253
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
be an adorable artwork of us all

254
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
if I've not already leaked it I probably

255
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
have already

256
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I prefer company leaks

257
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
in terms of the juices

258
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I mean

259
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
you know I'm here

260
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I leak literally everything about the

261
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I can't help it I get so excited

262
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
but I'm so upset because we actually

263
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
have

264
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
something

265
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
am I gonna block myself? I think I am a

266
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
little bit

267
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
we actually have something I'm not allowed to leak

268
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
right now and all I'm gonna say is it is torture

269
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
sorry but I'm not even being dramatic

270
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
when I say that it is torture

271
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
oh it's so cute

272
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
what's like the average score

273
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I wonder if I should like oopsies

274
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I mean maybe it's better it got pushed

275
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
over

276
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
stop leaking

277
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
damn fine can't help it

278
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
yeah we have to get everyone to 10k

279
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
happy pineapple literally

280
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
what's that pineapple been so cute for

281
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
the average is 1,800

282
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
are you wearing clothes in the artwork

283
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
uh

284
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
no really not really

285
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
no not in the artwork

286
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
no average score is 2k

287
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't know your main goal at least

288
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
at least get one watermelon

289
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
literally it's the best meme I don't know

290
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
why people are sick of it I don't care I get spammed

291
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
everywhere I love watermelon

292
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
okay let me finish my cup of tea

293
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
whilst I leak company

294
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
secrets as I always do

295
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
the clipping program

296
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
has been green lit for $2

297
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
per 1000 views

298
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
there is a cap

299
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
at 100k

300
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
so the maximum money you could make

301
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
from a clip is $200

302
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
however if that clip

303
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
for some reason like blew the fuck up

304
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I need to rate it out

305
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
in a specific way where it's like you get more

306
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
money if it blows up but it has to reach a

307
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
milestone so like 250k

308
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
and then you'd get a payout for that

309
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and clips are like obviously clips

310
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
need to have a timer on them

311
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
however we do have exceptions for

312
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
algorithm clips so clips that get

313
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
picked up in the algorithm mean

314
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
they weren't picked up at the start but maybe

315
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
3 months down the line it randomly got

316
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
we have an exception for that

317
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
so I am in the

318
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
process of

319
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
hold on I can play one handed

320
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and drink tea and leak company secrets

321
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I love this game

322
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
oh I missed

323
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
oh no

324
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
can I like force it to touch that one

325
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I can wait this is

326
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
actually physics simulator hold on

327
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
something's going on over there

328
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'll pop you there

329
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
a strongy snail

330
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
veal or snowden honestly

331
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
can't hold me back

332
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
youtube is currently cracking down on clip channels

333
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
yes that's why we wanted

334
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
to offer

335
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
money and exchange

336
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
and now you have to get except

337
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
oh no

338
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I need those cherries to kiss

339
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
draft hmm

340
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't think I can get the cherries to kiss

341
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
unless I can I push the yellow

342
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
thing away

343
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
ooh

344
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
why am I like

345
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
this

346
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
they're moving everything's moving

347
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
okay

348
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
hold on a minute

349
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
yes I got approval for that so I need to

350
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
write it yesterday I was writing the

351
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
script

352
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
it's currently my longest script

353
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
oh god I've messed this up

354
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
how are you supposed to like

355
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
can you plan ahead mentally

356
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
maybe you can

357
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
maybe you can plan ahead mentally

358
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
what if I do this

359
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
nothing's touching right I'm being

360
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
a bit silly like spreading everything out like this

361
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
if only

362
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
they could touch

363
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
well that bought me some time

364
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
right if those two pink ones

365
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
can just touch each other

366
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
are you squidding me right now

367
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000

are you okay though

389
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
there's like such a big gap down there

390
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
oh come on

391
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000

392
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
no go to the right

393
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
no no I need to push it to the right

394
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
come on go to the right

395
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
oh wait why aren't you touching

396
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
are you being so for real right now

397
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
you better touch right now

398
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm sorry for being great

399
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
DEMPA you have a wrench

400
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
you don't can

401
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
you've seen the meme rebecca's take away shop

402
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
edgin and my sakeer game

403
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
more likely than you think

404
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
she's approaching the end of her run

405
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
oh I'm messing it up

406
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I mean it doesn't look that bad

407
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
if I could get the pink ones to touch

408
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't know

409
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I mean for the first attempt

410
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
like you have to give it to me sorry

411
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
but this is a good first attempt

412
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I think it's a good first attempt anyway

413
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
so what do I need

414
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
you put my little strawberries together

415
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
put these together

416
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
oh no I messed

417
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
up then you look

418
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
then you look I'm embarrassed

419
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
okay there we go

420
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
can the cherries touch? why is nothing wanting to touch each other

421
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
are you allergic to each other

422
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
do you have a fruit allergy

423
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
can I like drop it to push it over

424
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
come on

425
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
split them apart

426
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
it's come on physics similar

427
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I saw this game's actually not that bad

428
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm sorry vTubers

429
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I don't know why I doubt you guys

430
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
literally I want to play supermarket simulator so

431
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
badly

432
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
but no one's gonna enjoy it

433
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and I'm like

434
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
doesn't Suica

435
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
have a button that bounces them

436
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
stop

437
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
it says move A for drop

438
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
X for menu

439
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Y for ranking

440
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
switch ranking

441
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't have that

442
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't even have the melons yet

443
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I mean

444
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
no I've only had a pineapple

445
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
but my score is over a thousand

446
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
so for my first attempt

447
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm

448
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
oh

449
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
that's not good

450
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
that's not good at all

451
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
oh no

452
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I didn't look at the life cycle

453
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
of the fruit properly

454
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
oh no wait

455
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
why did I do that

456
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
can things start

457
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
touching please

458
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
can things start shoving

459
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
each other out of the way

460
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
oh no it's ogre

461
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
what did I get

462
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
1360

463
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
that's so good

464
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
okay let me write that down

465
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
hold on write that down

466
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
that's not that bad

467
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm not even mad so I was

468
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
right high score

469
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
1360

470
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
it's okay groups you

471
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
what was the context

472
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
it keeps track for you

473
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
oh did I not even need to pin it

474
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
oh okay

475
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
monthly daily overall

476
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
right you have entered

477
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
the ranking

478
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
okay

479
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
did I just restart

480
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
right we got

481
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
we got a pineapple on our first attempt

482
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I don't know where I went horribly wrong

483
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I mean

484
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
no

485
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
why are you going all the way over there

486
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
stop being so dramatic honestly

487
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
don't roll away

488
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
do I make myself clear

489
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
don't you dare roll away

490
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I literally went halfway

491
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
across the map

492
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
vealer's suica arc

493
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I think emmy has a switch as well

494
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
so

495
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
she wants a cam stream

496
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
like so whenever I finish a game

497
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
always taping like a little review

498
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
in the discord and I'm like hey guys

499
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
this was a two over experience

500
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
this is what happened in the game

501
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
it was just a fun and a goof and a gaffe

502
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
basically and I'm like I'm sure

503
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
they're probably sick of it they're like

504
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
oh we get it strongy

505
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
shut off about your damn game

506
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
but like always review them and I'm like

507
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
oh if you want a chill game experience

508
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I was picking my schedule

509
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
for when my dad goes home

510
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and to avoid all the depression

511
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and I picked lego lord of the rings

512
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
to cheer me up

513
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
so don't be surprised

514
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
when you see lego

515
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
rollie pollie's away literally

516
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
strongy vs emmy suica

517
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
addition yes suica

518
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
or suica

519
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
yes I'm literally between lego lord

520
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
of the ring I'm so excited

521
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
we will eventually see

522
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
strongy in a steam

523
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
game review

524
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I wanted to do an indie game review

525
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
series where we give like

526
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
indies a shot because like

527
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
sometimes all you need is

528
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
like you know what

529
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
you know what an example is among us is an example

530
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
of like someone

531
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
picking up a game if you didn't know

532
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
among us came out and it wasn't

533
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
even that popular like at all

534
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and

535
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I don't know if that's a terrible idea

536
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
oh I've done it now

537
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I've done it now that was a

538
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
terrible idea don't ever do that again

539
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm sorry are you squidding me right now

540
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
touch

541
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
touch

542
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
touch

543
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
touch touch

544
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
more people need to

545
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
write reviews on streams from the

546
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
perspective of a streamer the

547
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
veiler game jam when

548
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
real or

549
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
steamer game

550
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
be sucky to be

551
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
sweet

552
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
is lego lord of the rings the same level of quality

553
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
as old star wars yes

554
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I literally

555
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
this sounds really sad but I remember

556
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
where all the items are hidden and everything

557
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
and the maps are so what we're going to do

558
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
when we play lego lord of the rings is

559
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm going to play through the entire campaign

560
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and then we're going to go back and pick up

561
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
all the stuff because I know where everything is

562
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
why am I throwing am I throwing

563
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
why did that work out the game

564
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
just let me throw

565
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
oh my god I love when the game lets you throw

566
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and it like bails you out randomly

567
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
pansley gameplay oh yeah

568
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
pansley's go up

569
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
august 1st the girls get access

570
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
actually on the last day

571
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
of this month

572
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
and it's up to them how much they want to do

573
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
and they keep 100% of their cut

574
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
because veiler did not specify they had to stream

575
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
on that website so we don't take anything

576
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
so if you want to support them you may support

577
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
away have you tried

578
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
shadow of mordor

579
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I thought I did I looked at gameplay

580
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I think I must have played a demo or something

581
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
so we're actually going to play that

582
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
for the first time yeah we got pizza already

583
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
we're going to play

584
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
it's technically for the first time but I am

585
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
familiar with the mechanics I mean we'll find out

586
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
on the day when I play honestly right let me finish

587
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
this team before it gets freaking freezing cold

588
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
well anyone be posting links

589
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
the names are already taken exactly

590
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
as found so you don't really need to dig

591
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
you'll see them and use their alternative

592
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
twers anonymous thank you for the tip

593
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I was rewatching

594
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
the yumi plus concert reaction and the thought

595
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
came to my head I can imagine

596
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
scrawny going on a hype rock rampage

597
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
singing

598
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
songs by my chemical romance

599
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
she be caught in bumps sounds like she would

600
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
enjoy singing R&B

601
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
we were we're going to talk

602
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
about it in the meeting

603
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I don't think it would be cute

604
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
but I did not know this

605
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
emi has insane

606
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
stage fright when it comes to singing

607
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I didn't know

608
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I thought she was joking

609
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
em because she like put a little

610
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
cute message because we have dm's

611
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
with yumi plus like all the girls in yumi plus

612
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
they're all sorry let me finish my tea holy crap

613
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I can't keep rambling it's going to go freezing

614
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
what do you think of bandsley versus patreon

615
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
patreon is a staple

616
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
income source whereas bandsley is not for the girls

617
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
so I obviously

618
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm biased if you want to support the girls

619
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
doing it via patreon

620
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I've got an azeria update actually

621
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I need permission to talk about it

622
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
if she's still with it or not hold on

623
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
are you cool with me

624
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
talking about

625
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I actually have a collab

626
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
with azeria today so I hope you're not sick of her

627
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
because I get to play with her today

628
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
okay

629
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I don't know a good place to put these down

630
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I don't even did I do that

631
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I feel like the game did that for me

632
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I feel like the game has like a tiny little

633
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
magnet that gives you a

634
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
who goes there a few pixels of like relief

635
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
because that's insane

636
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
what's going on here

637
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I've got

638
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
apparently azeria shorts

639
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
are about to come through tomorrow and I'm freaking

640
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
humping this screen

641
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
because azeria has like hilarious shorts

642
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
coming through

643
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
emmy oh my god right sorry

644
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I keep mentioning emmy

645
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
she like she'll send me shorts

646
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
and it's literally emmy and denpa talking

647
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
about cheese

648
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
and I'm like emmy what do you want me to do

649
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
with this clip how am I supposed to turn it

650
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
into something that's appropriate

651
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
and she's

652
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
she's just fucking she's amazing

653
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
she's a hoot in a hauler to work with

654
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I don't care what anyone says sorry but

655
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
literally my little sister is so

656
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
freaking adorable

657
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I don't care

658
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
literally so in the discord

659
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
this is just straight up leaks at this point

660
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
in the discord there's a channel where the girls can submit clips

661
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
so if you guys clip anyone's stream at any point

662
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and you give it a title

663
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
she'll be able to she'll send it to me

664
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
and then I'll send it on to Nedder

665
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
as I said she's got a song cover coming out soon

666
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm just waiting for a few things to finalize

667
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
and then it'll come out

668
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
although I think it might be delayed unfortunately

669
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
it was supposed to come out when she was away on holiday

670
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
but oh my god sorry let me finish this tea

671
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I've still not finished it

672
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
it's gonna be frozen

673
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
that's straight tea

674
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
that was a rubbish tea

675
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
cute daughter emmer's honestly

676
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000

677
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
they're actually like so fun to work with

678
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I don't care what I like literally they're just

679
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
ooh right

680
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
so this is the problem

681
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
the pineapple is now taking up the middle section

682
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I'm needing it to take a laugh

683
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
thank you vealer lover for the tip

684
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
viotin

686
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000

am I gonna get

688
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000

711
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000

712
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
whilst I was writing the pregnancy script ASMR

713
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I could have sworn at one point

714
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
she sounded like freaking iron mouse

715
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
she made a voice and it sounded just like her

716
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
and I was like

717
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I didn't know you could make that voice

718
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
monster supremacy

719
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
there's no one

805
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I am not expecting the honey

806
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
juice to go up

807
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
but it is

808
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
we got the melon between the water

809
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
this has got the same

810
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
tension as bobble bubble

811
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
oh is that another game

812
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
you don't run into many surely

813
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
surely not

814
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
you've got a decent set up

815
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
not too many fruit trapped underneath

816
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
oh I'm not to trap them underneath

817
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
trap them underneath

818
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
mmm the bigger the fruit

819
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
are surprisingly

820
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
late in the physics

821
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I'm learning

822
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm learning right pop

823
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
that was not what I wanted it to be

824
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
why are you going down

825
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
it keeps pushing the honey do

826
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
up but I'm not really wanting it

827
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
to be up

828
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
not really wanting it to be up

829
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
if I'm being honest

830
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
it's kind of ruining the flow

831
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
of my gameplay

832
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
actually I'm ruining the flow

833
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
of my gameplay I'm currently

834
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
sabotaging myself what is this

835
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000

836
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000

right now

838
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I can't believe it I'm shipping fruit

839
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I'm gonna have to shove this over here

840
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
oh things are moving

841
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000

842
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
oh okay

843
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000

844
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000

845
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000

a little bit

848
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
seek her approval I didn't have time to do

934
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
it yesterday because I was writing my

935
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
pregnancy somewhere

936
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
oh my god my dad came up to my PC

937
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
so he doesn't normally like lurk over

938
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
my PC or anything and I was

939
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
legit typing like oh I can't wait to meet

940
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
you like I can't wait to like give birth

941
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
and feed you for the first time and all of that

942
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I mean he came up to the fucking PC

943
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
and I had to like start playing with the desktop

944
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
and that I'm like no I'm not that I'm just doing

945
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
a wee bit of work like I was like oh my god

946
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
like please

947
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
so my dad doesn't give like two rats

948
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
ours but it's a lot harder

949
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
to explain like why I'm

950
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
fucking writing pregnancy ASMR

951
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
than it is to be like

952
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
you know I'm just writing like a script

953
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
right now like you probably don't want to

954
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
type thing oh I've just

955
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
ruined it unless

956
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
no it's not gonna pop

957
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
nothing's gonna pop

958
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
if things started rotating maybe

959
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
but it's

960
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
ogre I've ruined it

961
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I've ruined it

962
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I've ruined it no

963
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
okay sorry

964
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
but we did actually get a pretty decent score

965
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I'm actually not too mad

966
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
unless

967
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
no wait you popped

968
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and then no the game killed

969
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
itself don't be so rude

970
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
right one seven two three that was really good

971
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
hold on

972
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
high score

973
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
high score

974
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
hold on I can't take it

975
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
one seven two six

976
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
right in my head

977
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
please

978
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
the way I actually

979
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
can't put

980
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I believe in you you'll be able to play with melons

981
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
soon enough

982
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I believe in you you'll be able to play with melons

983
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
soon enough

984
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm not done thank you Kaidon and thank you

985
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Brian for reading it

986
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
the first round

987
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
shambles it's a learning moment

988
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
getting stronger right strawberry don't go halfway

989
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
across the map I'm putting you on the right

990
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
side because I know you're gonna try and roll

991
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
yeah that's right

992
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
that's right I've got you figured out little strawberry

993
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
don't think I don't know what you're doing

994
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I know exactly what shenanigans

995
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
you're up to

996
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
or should I say

997
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
stop everything's rolling

998
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
rolling rolling rolling rolling

999
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
what rolling rolling rolling

1000
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
come on

1001
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
meow

1002
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
meow meow meow

1003
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
are you squinting me right now

1004
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
who goes there identify yourself

1005
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
what

1006
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I'm sure there's like a good tactic I haven't solved it yet

1007
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I mean

1008
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
it's alright I would say the game

1009
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
is fun when you're winning

1010
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
but when the game looks like you're not really getting

1011
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
anywhere it's just kind of like

1012
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
ahh

1013
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I missed oh

1014
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
you cheated you made it look like

1015
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
you were gonna be a thing

1016
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
you think you did

1017
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
anonymous what do you say I gotta be funny

1018
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
if all the reeflings wrote wholesome messages to pathastronic

1019
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
so he doesn't have to worry his daughter's

1020
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
fans aren't treating her right no he's

1021
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
fine with you guys I think he's

1022
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
actually gonna write a letter for you

1023
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
so that I get to read but I'm only allowed to

1024
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
read it when he's away I'll probably end up crying

1025
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
impressive she stayed

1026
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
relatively calm you having fun

1027
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
it's amy it's alright

1028
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I don't know

1029
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
maybe it's just kind of one of those games

1030
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
because I just remember

1031
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
it came out and

1032
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
everywhere you looked

1033
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
it did not matter who you looked at

1034
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
they were sitting on this game challenging

1035
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
each although that was actually probably the fun

1036
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
of it challenging each other to like

1037
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
oh if you get

1038
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
cherries please touch

1039
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
if you get like

1040
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
X amount of

1041
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
you know

1042
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
addiction yes basically

1043
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
and the lyrics limit biscuit

1044
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Lauren unironically rames the word here

1045
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
with the word here literal

1046
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
lyrical crime

1047
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
yeah the competitiveness

1048
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I just remember everyone was like oh this is

1049
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
my score beat it and then everyone was

1050
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
like today we're going to be in the score

1051
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
and I think that's where

1052
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
the fun of it came in

1053
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I don't know maybe I'm allowed to set it

1054
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
and then I'll challenge the girls because I know

1055
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
emmy's got a switch

1056
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
ac just got a switch

1057
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
oh that was it oh my god sorry the minute though

1058
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
it's a bit satisfying hold on a minute this game

1059
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
hold on hold on I was a bit hasty in my review

1060
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
that was rather satisfying

1061
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
um

1062
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
oh I just blocked myself off

1063
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
and it doesn't matter because it just

1064
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
bounced halfway across the map that's fine

1065
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I didn't want that anyway

1066
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
um

1067
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
oh okay we've got a peach

1068
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
we've got a peach

1069
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
ah

1070
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I just got the watermelon on my third attempt

1071
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
stop you guys

1072
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
someone said that they said they were playing a game

1073
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
alongside me and they had

1074
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
beat it like three times over by the time

1075
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I won my first attempt at it I can't remember

1076
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
what game it was and I was like

1077
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
are you literally sniping the game

1078
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
and doing like ten times better than me

1079
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
um I was absolutely

1080
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000

1081
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000

1086
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000

1091
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
there's not enough room

1095
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I don't know why something

1096
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
oh I don't know sometimes it'll

1097
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
move in the oh come on

1098
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
say it ain't so

1100
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I will not go

1101
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
turn the lights

1102
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
oh they kiss

1103
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
was it valid true it might have been

1104
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
it might have been because I checked

1105
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
my marshmallows after stream and you guys always

1106
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
say such nice things I'm so sorry to worry

1107
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
you guys again I had loads of marshmallows

1108
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
that were like are you alive

1109
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I literally passed out after stream

1110
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I was so weak

1111
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
in frail

1112
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I had this fruit juice in the fridge

1113
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
so I opened that up and like

1114
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
took a few sips and then passed out

1115
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
and I think it was like low I hadn't

1116
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
had anything to eat I'd just

1117
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
woken up I didn't stretch I haven't

1118
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
exercised in ages

1119
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
um like all of those factors

1120
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
came together at the same time

1121
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
and it was like ooh shouldn't have done that

1122
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
by the way

1123
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I had a really fun time on the stream though

1124
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
like I enjoy Ring Fit I like

1125
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
that it's different I like that I can move around

1126
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I think it would be a lot more

1127
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
effective if it was a 3D stream

1128
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
like a 3D model stream

1129
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
things are gonna have to start

1130
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
kissing or I'm gonna be in trouble

1131
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I think I'm in trouble things aren't kissing

1132
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
okay but again same

1133
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
problem things aren't kissing

1134
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
unless we

1135
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
force them to kiss

1136
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
no I'm just

1137
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
creating a gap and now I've created a problem

1138
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I've created a monster

1139
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
nobody wants to see Marshall no more

1140
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
he's top level

1141
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Ring Fit can never harm you again

1142
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
well like everyone was like

1143
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
oh my god your heart rate and I'm like

1144
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
oh wait I've not told you the lore here

1145
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I haven't

1146
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
like an abnormal heart rate it's faster

1147
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I'm a hamster

1148
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
too long didn't read

1149
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I'm a hamster okay don't worry

1150
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
about my heart rate it's normal for me

1151
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
it's not normal for you but it's normal for me

1152
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I'm on how am I messing

1153
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000

00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
like observations and if I ever

1155
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
have any concerns about my heart I'm just

1156
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000

1157
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000

1185
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I'm so sorry actually

1187
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
my dad said hi to AC yesterday

1188
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I was like

1189
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
dad say Privyat she's Russian

1190
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
and he was like

1191
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
he couldn't get it out and I'm just like

1192
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Privyat Privyat

1193
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
but she couldn't hear him in the headset

1194
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
and I was like oh not really

1195
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
echoes of monkey noise

1196
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
in the distance honestly

1197
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
see I like when it does it

1198
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
by itself

1199
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
oh no

1200
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000

1203
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
actually

1204
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I believe in red grapes

1205
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
superiority over green grapes

1206
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I said what I said it's like red apples

1207
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
red apples are sweet

1208
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
green apples are sour

1209
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
grandaddle

1210
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000

1216
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
oh something popped

1217
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I like when it randomly pops

1218
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I'm like ooh what was that

1219
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000

1220
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
thanks for hanging

1221
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I don't know if Emmy is up next

1222
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000

1223
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000

00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
no kiss the other way

1225
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I'm being trolled

1226
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I just suck at this game

1227
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
honestly

1228
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
you know how about I just accept the fact I suck

1229
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
how about that

1230
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
instead of try hard and being upset

1231
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
every time I do

1232
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I'll come on

1233
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
no

1234
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
no

1235
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
please rotate

1236
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
a little to the left

1237
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
okay

1238
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
okay

1239
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
okay

1240
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
something's moving

1241
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
are you squidding me right now

1242
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
okay

1243
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
throwing for content

1244
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
the fanbases would be upset

1245
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
no all the girls are fine

1246
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
what the

1247
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
no I'm not gonna die

1248
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I promise literally the doctor

1249
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
cleared me and she was like

1250
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
if you have any concerns just come back in

1251
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
because I was saying like I have loads of palpitations

1252
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
and all that

1253
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
and I have a faster resting heart rate

1254
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
heart rate and she was like you're just a hamster

1255
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
smell

1256
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
okay

1257
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
at least

1258
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I need you the other game but I've completely

1259
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
balls it up

1260
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I don't know what the secret method or tactic is

1261
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
but I have yet to figure it out

1262
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I'm not throwing for content I'm just dumb

1263
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
okay those are two separate things

1264
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
these are two issues we're having to deal with

1265
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
at the same time I'm just

1266
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
incredibly dumb okay

1267
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000

oh he found the secret chat

1325
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
sounds like cheating to me those are

1326
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
sukyo paths

1327
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
people with a lot of patience

1328
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
are practice

1329
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
honestly don't know how you can do that without a cheat

1330
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
yeah that seems insane some people are that

1331
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I mean I'm sure there's

1332
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
probably some sort of hidden method

1333
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
right there boom get right

1334
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
okay and then just shove everything

1335
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
to the side of this

1336
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
okay

1337
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
yeah

1338
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I don't know how to do this

1339
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
put the cherry there then it can come

1340
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
off the wall baby

1341
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
oh no I blocked off that strawberry

1342
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I wasn't using oh

1343
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
are we going to do that

1344
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
but how it did

1345
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I can't remember

1346
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
sukyo is a drug in Japan

1347
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I wonder if it's because it's like such

1348
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
a nice casual experience like you don't

1349
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
have to try hard it's not like you log in

1350
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
you like waste all your like progression

1351
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
or whatever it's not like that

1352
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
it's just like you can open it up

1353
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
sit down and have a

1354
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
just some casual fun honestly

1355
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
so I was a bit folk or so mean about casual gamers

1356
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
but

1357
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
casual gamers are eating well sorry they are

1358
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
like

1359
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
maybe we were too hasty

1360
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
maybe we shouldn't have judged

1361
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I can't tell if gimli just meowed

1362
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
or there's

1363
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
a note in this game that sounded like a cat meowing

1364
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
in my brains like gimli

1365
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
right we'll put the orange here

1366
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
cause we're gonna get I know oh well

1367
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
talk about hashtag predictions

1368
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
okay there's an orange there

1369
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
then we do that

1370
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
and then we do this one

1371
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
and then we do this one

1372
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
and then put orange here

1373
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
and then we've got yellow

1374
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
it's like match three games in facebook

1375
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
mums stop that

1376
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
that's a little too real

1377
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
remember when the statistics came out about

1378
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
who's the biggest populace in gaming

1379
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
and it was like

1380
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
because of like games like farmville

1381
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
and candy crush

1382
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
women overall are like the biggest

1383
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
player base

1384
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
because of those statistics

1385
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I remember reading it and it was like

1386
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
oh my

1387
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
what happened

1388
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I don't know what happened but I'll take it

1389
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
and it was like oh my god

1390
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I can't believe it

1391
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
it was like women over four

1392
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
are the biggest gamer

1393
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
literally and I was like holy shit

1394
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
we need to like level up gamers

1395
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
holy crap

1396
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
that's so cute

1397
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
okay we already got telly

1398
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
we orange

1399
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
becomes other orange

1400
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
then orange and orange becomes cherry

1401
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
becomes lemon

1402
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
let them get up

1403
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
let them get up

1404
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
right we're gonna put the purple here

1405
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
and then we're gonna put the orange here

1406
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
and then we're gonna put the grape here

1407
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
you're not grape you're a strawberry

1408
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
oh no I don't want to

1409
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
separate them too much and then two oranges

1410
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
make a telly and then an orange

1411
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
okay I think I'm getting the order

1412
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
things a little bit

1413
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
it'd be better

1414
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
but

1415
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I'm getting it maybe

1416
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I'll speak a little too soon but if you

1417
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
wow

1418
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
you're not a real gamer if you don't speak too

1419
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I'm strategising

1420
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
only match two if you dare

1421
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
my mum was really good at tetris and when she found the tetris battle royale game

1422
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
she was hurt honestly

1423
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I would know my mum plays

1424
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
those whenever she has downtime

1425
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
and developed a worse gaming addiction

1426
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
than me

1427
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I think the sims doesn't count as games

1428
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
oh that is the hot take

1429
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I

1430
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
kinda used to be like that

1431
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
where I was like oh that's not a real game

1432
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
but then I was like you know what

1433
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
let people have fun

1434
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
like

1435
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
if people are happy playing a game I'm just happy

1436
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
they kinda have like something

1437
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
they have something like downtime wise

1438
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I think I don't know I just think it's sweet

1439
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I just think it's nice

1440
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
okay

1441
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
what did that do for me

1442
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
exactly

1443
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
that is exactly

1444
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
why I didn't want to put that damn cherry there

1445
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
it's pushing the peach up though

1446
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
okay

1447
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
okay some things are

1448
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
moving

1449
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I don't know if I want to put it inside there

1450
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
that's what she said

1451
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
don't say such things

1452
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
it's first thing in the morning in refland

1453
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
don't say such things

1454
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
okay there I think that was probably the better idea

1455
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
rather than to separate

1456
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
oh no

1457
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
put the orange there

1458
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
all according to plan

1459
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I can't believe we're literally strategizing

1460
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
on a freaking fruit game

1461
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
right if those two

1462
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
cherries can kiss up there

1463
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
that would be cute

1464
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
what was if he kissed

1465
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
what was if he did wiggle of kitten

1466
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
the sims isn't giving every girl all 400

1467
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
US dollars worth it

1468
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
bruh I think his are paid for the DLC

1469
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
and I was like are you joking me

1470
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
just fucking message me next time a DLC comes out

1471
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
oh wait she said hi to me

1472
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
she said hi to me in the end

1473
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
okay

1474
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
one second

1475
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
okay everything's fine

1476
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I thought something went

1477
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
exploded no I'm just kidding

1478
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
right let's try again focus up

1479
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
we are gamers

1480
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
we know how to game

1481
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
for the most part

1482
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
stop giving me the wee ones

1483
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
please

1484
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
if I wanted them to go there

1485
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I would have put them there

1486
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
not the cherry that accidentally

1487
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
fell down there blocking

1488
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
the big apple

1489
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
come on

1490
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I thought this game was supposed to be easy

1491
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
your gamers still have leveled up

1492
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
gain strategizing well I've literally just backfired

1493
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
in 4k how dare you curse me

1494
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
right now

1495
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
literally just backfired horrifically

1496
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
right you too

1497
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
finally right if those peaches can kiss

1498
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
please kiss

1499
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
they look like mochi balls

1500
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
mochi balls mochi balls

1501
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
mochi balls

1502
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
gotta catch them all

1503
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
that's not what that is

1504
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
right okay

1505
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
okay okay

1506
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
okay let them get up let them get up let them get up

1507
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
stop

1508
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
giving me cherries and strawberries

1509
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
sorry I'm about to become cherries in 4k

1510
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
it keeps giving me the wee ones

1511
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
which makes my game harder

1512
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
stop

1513
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
getting me the wee ends

1514
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
right I'm gonna put this here

1515
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
and then I'm gonna roll

1516
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
oh well I literally ruled the orange thing

1517
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
right

1518
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
what does that mean

1519
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
what does it mean

1520
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
will someone please

1521
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
think about what it means

1522
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
okay there's things moving

1523
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
you're allowed to move

1524
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I give you permission to move

1525
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
just as I give you permission to breathe

1526
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
right that's gonna create an apple

1527
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
on the top left

1528
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
if that apple kisses a lemon

1529
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
it becomes a peach which kisses that peach there

1530
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
so that's fine

1531
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
so we're gonna put an orange here

1532
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
on purpose

1533
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
and then we're gonna roll

1534
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
for an orange

1535
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
wait

1536
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
oh

1537
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
why am I born like

1538
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
this

1539
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
okay there we go there we go

1540
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
sorry I did it I'm so sorry

1541
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I don't know why I'm born like this

1542
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I don't know

1543
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
why I'm born like that

1544
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
seriously I literally say the strategy out loud

1545
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
and then my brain's like do you want to do this

1546
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
and I'm like sure

1547
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
no

1548
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
stop

1549
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
how did I get them to touch

1550
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
oh my god

1551
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
actual strategy I can't believe it

1552
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
thinking about and planning your next move

1553
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
helps

1554
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
this can't be true

1555
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
no I was gonna hope

1556
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
they would touch the orange in time

1557
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I can't believe it

1558
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
wait things are moving

1559
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I need things to settle before I can start planning

1560
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
is that cantaloupe it is

1561
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
the thing is

1562
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
why this game gripped the beach

1563
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
you're for nearly a year what a melon

1564
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
and then I'm allowed to go okay

1565
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
that's when I have permission

1566
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
we are purely morals living

1567
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
in a world for a single cow

1568
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000

what do you want from me

1635
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000

1636
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
right now but right I'll strategize

1637
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000

1645
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
but not enough

1646
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
a thousand years of strongy don't

1647
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000

3 that's not but I'll take

1676
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
that hell yeah why don't I get a round of applause

1677
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
for this one though it gives me a round

1678
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
of applause for my terrible attempt

1679
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
but this time

1680
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
it's like right alright then

1681
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
alright then

1682
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
that's what I thought that's what I thought

1683
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
give me a round of applause yeah yeah I did good

1684
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
a bit my high score

1685
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
we start we start we start

1686
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
surely we can get a watermelon

1687
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
before stream has to end surely

1688
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
surely

1689
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
surely

1690
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
surely green eggs and ham

1691
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
that I actually need to strategize

1692
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I kind of don't want to use my brain though

1693
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
ummmm

1694
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
kind of don't want to use my brain

1695
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
nah

1696
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
right we want to shove those

1697
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
together

1698
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
right just fine bomb that's

1699
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
fine then you there

1700
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
then you there

1701
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
then you there

1702
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
then you here

1703
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
then you there

1704
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
sorry I'm actually sweating

1705
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
betting on a 5 hour stream

1706
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
no I can't

1707
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
see normally this would

1708
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
devolve into a 5 hour stream naturally

1709
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
but cause my dad's here

1710
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
we're going out today

1711
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
to a cafe again

1712
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
mommy's mail in live

1713
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
what just happened I believe

1714
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
thank you Kaidon I hopefully believe too

1715
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I do not believe

1716
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
but I believe oh no did I just break

1717
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
my game

1718
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
did I just break my input

1719
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
no did I just break my input

1720
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I broke my I broke my input

1721
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
are you serious

1722
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
no I broke my input

1723
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
cause I'm freaking streaming off the end

1724
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
gato hold on

1725
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
hold on hold on hold on

1726
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
look at another music just

1727
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
like casually caressing us in the background

1728
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
hold on hold on hold on

1729
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
hold on hold on hold on

1730
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
nope that's not it

1731
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
hold on I can't believe I broke that are you serious

1732
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
why are you if I broken the L gap

1733
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
where the fuck is it

1734
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
why are you acting like

1735
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I'm not doing input right now

1736
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I have no idea

1737
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I'm gonna close it and open it again

1738
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
and if it doesn't pop up

1739
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I think the stream's over unironically

1740
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
hold on

1741
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
um

1742
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
open

1743
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
oh my god

1744
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
oh my god I'm so smart

1745
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
but now it's not full screen

1746
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
why is it not full screen

1747
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
hold on let me make it full screen

1748
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
and then I'll show off

1749
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
alright how the fuck did I make this full screen

1750
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
you can totally see I'm having to

1751
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
right so the way the freaking L Gato

1752
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
works is in order for me to see the gameplay

1753
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I have to capture it be a fucking

1754
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
movie what maker

1755
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I know I was so scuffed

1756
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I was so scuffed I was the only way I could figure out

1757
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
how to be able to see my stream

1758
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
whilst I play the game

1759
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
and capture it to you at the same time

1760
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
but it's not freaking full screen anymore

1761
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I think I'm just gonna have to manually capture it

1762
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
don't look don't look

1763
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I know I know it's got

1764
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
stop stop looking hold on let me fix it

1765
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
let's see like watch this

1766
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I'm gonna close the bottom see oh oh

1767
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
you don't see nothing oh you can't tell

1768
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000

1769
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000

01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
a movie capture

1771
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
yeah the L Gato is a bit funny I have to admit

1772
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
but as long as the L Gato

1773
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000

what are you on about that I'm using

1782
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
really scuffed mechanics just to record

1783
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
the screen consumption

1784
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000

they go against each other

1788
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000

from the accusations are you just gonna take it

1821
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000

camp panties

1826
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
thank you for the tip

1827
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Bob

1828
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
they're not pre-recorded

1829
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
stop

1830
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
thank you tiny spiny

1831
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
wait what stream did we think it was pre-recorded on

1832
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
thank you Bob for stealing my panties

1833
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I'm not wearing pantyloons as well

1834
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
see Bob actually knows I'm wearing pantyloons

1835
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
it's so weird wearing clothes

1836
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
I'm gonna say I've actually

1837
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I've kind of gotten used to wearing clothes at this point now

1838
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
but it is rather odd

1839
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I'm not really that used to it yet

1840
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
okay

1841
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
purple can go there

1842
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
but strawberry and cherry has to go over here

1843
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
and then this is all gonna pop

1844
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
oh my god I'm actually using my head for once

1845
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
ah

1846
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
if I put too strawberry

1847
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
on this side

1848
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
that will become a purple thing and it'll be happy

1849
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
oh well nope I've just

1850
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
absolutely messed myself up doing that

1851
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
nice one

1852
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
you want to try that again? no? do you just want to ruin the entire gameplay?

1853
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
yeah okay well as long as you're having fun

1854
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
yeah thanks brain

1855
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
no

1856
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
the game knows exactly

1857
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
where I put that

1858
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
the game knows exactly

1859
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
where I put that

1860
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
right

1861
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
okay that was actually really lucky

1862
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
okay okay okay

1863
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
let him get up

1864
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
right we're gonna put this over here

1865
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
and then we're gonna put the orange one right here

1866
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
and then we're just gonna throw all the stuff down here

1867
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
until we get what we want

1868
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
okay we're here for something in particular

1869
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
we're not gonna go until we get it

1870
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
do I make myself clear?

1871
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
exactly that's what I want

1872
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
boom boom boom boom

1873
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
oh you can kiss

1874
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
it's okay don't be shy

1875
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
yeah it's only a save for work

1876
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
are you sure AC is the feral one?

1877
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
honestly oh we actually got a cantaloupe

1878
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
like so early on

1879
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
I guess the baby pit

1880
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
strategy

1881
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
the kiss

1882
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
a few of you have been

1883
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
confessing in my marshmallow that you get a bone bone when I kiss

1884
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
and I'm like you shouldn't have told me that

1885
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I've got too much power now

1886
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
okay

1887
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
you've given me too much power

1888
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
you have

1889
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I did not put it on that say

1890
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
don't

1891
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
things are popping

1892
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
probably lack under rapid

1893
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
right that's clearly not gonna touch

1894
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
anything but that is there

1895
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
who's leaking

1896
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
what is marshmallow?

1897
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
marshmallow is a way you can anonymously talk

1898
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
to me

1899
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
and leave me like questions about stuff

1900
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
you want me to answer

1901
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
or things you would like me to do for the girls

1902
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
that kind of thing

1903
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
or stuff that you would like to look out for

1904
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
or look forward to

1905
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
or stream suggestions as well

1906
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
you can like straight up tell me what you want me to play

1907
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
a lot of

1908
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
reeflings may not realise that you guys

1909
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
actually I can't believe I'm gonna say this

1910
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
your guys' opinion

1911
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
squeezed me quite strongly

1912
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I'm not gonna lie

1913
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
you guys

1914
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
opinionated

1915
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
wait we're actually on a decent run

1916
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
sorry don't jinx it

1917
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
if I put a cherry here

1918
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
that's fine

1919
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I'm gonna have to sacrifice

1920
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
oh I need to think

1921
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
I'm actually having to use my

1922
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
oh no things start moving my plan goes out the window

1923
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
right

1924
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
oh my god right okay okay it's fine

1925
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
it's fine

1926
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
just let it happen

1927
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
okay I think this is gonna have to

1928
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
be the sacrifice side now

1929
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
unless I put the orange one there

1930
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
no why would you do something

1931
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
like that

1932
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
why would you betray me like that

1933
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I'm strategising so hard right now

1934
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
and this is how you repay me

1935
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
this is how you repay me

1936
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I'm actually getting trolled in this game

1937
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
we have influence

1938
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
reeflings stay winning

1939
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
wow that's a big one

1940
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I'm proud to admit I'm one of those fellow reeflings

1941
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
against a sudden richness

1942
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
I don't know if you're littered

1943
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I mean you're littered but

1944
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
right

1945
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
if I put these two down here

1946
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I get an orange okay

1947
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I need one more orange and then that

1948
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I'm having to sacrifice this entire

1949
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
side

1950
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
ah right

1951
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
oh I'm having to sacrifice

1952
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
this entire side for a payoff

1953
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
hopefully

1954
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
okay we got yellow what did yellow become

1955
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I need a second yellow

1956
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
I'm in trouble

1957
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
okay orange I'll take it

1958
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
then a cherry

1959
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
and then a mix

1960
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
okay we've got an apple

1961
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
we just need one more apple and then the peaches

1962
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
will kiss

1963
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
and then life will be hunky dory

1964
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I repeat life will be hunky dory

1965
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
any hunky doryers

1966
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
no

1967
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
oh is that gonna be

1968
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
are we gonna be okay

1969
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I think we're okay

1970
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
I think

1971
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
okay

1972
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
draft hold on

1973
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
am I gonna have to roll for an orange

1974
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
on the left side

1975
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I'm gonna roll

1976
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
for an orange

1977
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
unless the game does that

1978
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
which you're not really supposed to do that

1979
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
because I wasn't actually planning on you doing that

1980
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
it's three game for me and I'm

1981
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
not sleeping till you get a war

1982
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
the pressure jeez I ain't that good at the game

1983
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
alright we've got an orange

1984
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
we're gonna pop it right here

1985
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
and we're just

1986
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
gonna do the throw method

1987
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
because we need to roll for an orange

1988
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
okay it's starting to backfire

1989
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
I repeat it's starting to backfire

1990
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
okay okay okay okay okay

1991
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000

01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
effort and work

1997
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
to get nowhere and in the end

1998
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000

1999
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000

doesn't work

2011
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I tried so high

2012
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000

sand mammals from

2043
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Star Wars please tell me

2044
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
you guys heard that too the wee thing that goes

2045
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
wow

2046
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I've forgotten what they're

2047
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
called yeah clap clap kiss

2048
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
oh I kill me

2049
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
they're not called one for that so the hairy

2050
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
tusky things that look like

2051
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
um

2052
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
willy mammoths but different

2053
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
this is probably been said before

2054
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
but the hair pattern activating when the avatar

2055
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
bugs is kinda crazy oh it's my sleep toggle

2056
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
are you ready

2057
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
this is my sleep toggle

2058
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
when I go to sleep

2059
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I hypnotize you so you don't attack me

2060
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
because I'm a cuttlefish and I'm actually quite edible

2061
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
if you want to get really technical

2062
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
but that's my sleep

2063
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
but I can put I can manually put my hair

2064
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
on my hypno pattern

2065
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
hi I'm

2066
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
I'm a cuttlefish by the way I know

2067
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
I don't know hypnosis often but I promise

2068
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
I'm working on it I just need time

2069
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
I'm working on my hypnosis stream

2070
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
did you just leak that you're doing a stream

2071
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
dedicated to hypnosis yes I did

2072
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
I'm writing a script

2073
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
for it so I don't mess up though

2074
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
okay let's sweat

2075
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
let's sweat I wanna make you sweat

2076
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I will say one thing against this game

2077
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I am gonna slander this game slightly

2078
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
so if this is your favourite game please do close

2079
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
your ear holes

2080
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
it's only fun when things are going

2081
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
your way but when things aren't going your way

2082
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
it's just frustrating

2083
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
oh my god

2084
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
actually that just

2085
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
reminded me I saw a comment on my YouTube

2086
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
this morning someone went

2087
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
this is the most casual Elden Ring player

2088
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
I've ever seen and obviously

2089
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
it was a stream where I was summoning all you guys

2090
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
in to do the work and I'm like

2091
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
oh well yeah that's kind of the point

2092
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I get to have fun with my reeflings

2093
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I was giggling I'm sure

2094
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
they were like oh my god let's see if this VTuber

2095
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
is any good at Elden Ring

2096
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
maybe and like hi reeflings

2097
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
can the reeflings do it

2098
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
oh you can do it like halfway across the map

2099
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
with my crossbow ball spraying

2100
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
and missing everything

2101
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
honestly I was giggling away

2102
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I was like brrr you've come to the wrong streamer

2103
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
if you're looking for skills

2104
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
literally making reeflings play the game for it

2105
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
whilst I'm like shoving food in my face

2106
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
my favourite is that a reefling

2107
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
gave me that crossbow ball that sprays

2108
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
and then I missed all my shots

2109
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
but won

2110
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
and like you guys were giving me like

2111
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
runes to level up in that

2112
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I think when we go back to Elden Ring

2113
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
we'll play the base game to activate Ranny

2114
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
and then

2115
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
we'll go and do the DLC

2116
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
and enjoy it because I was kind of speedrunning through it

2117
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
I didn't mean to speedrun through it

2118
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
but just like

2119
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
I knew we were up against the Vaude

2120
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
at 12 hours so I'm like

2121
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
okay what's next show me what's next

2122
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
reeflings type thing

2123
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
but I think we need to maybe slow it down

2124
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
and enjoy ourselves

2125
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
like I said we're not in a major rush

2126
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
as if those are crisscross applesauce

2127
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
and right now

2128
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
right I've got orange

2129
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
I'm wondering

2130
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
I bet you if I just spammed down the middle

2131
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I'd actually get more points than

2132
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
when I actually try hard in the game

2133
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I'm looking forward to more Elden Ring

2134
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
I'm glad you are

2135
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
yeah

2136
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
I am looking forward to

2137
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
doing the DLC

2138
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
more of it because

2139
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I don't actually know what's up ahead

2140
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
all in all in those

2141
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
like the classic lines like put these

2142
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
full of shambushes to rest

2143
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
just popping in real quick

2144
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I'm doing shit but I'm in the game

2145
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I'm doing absolutely amazing in real life

2146
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
although I'm a bit sad because

2147
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
my dad's going home

2148
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
soon and it feels like we've not

2149
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
really done anything fun together

2150
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
like we've been to cafes

2151
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
we've been on a few car journeys

2152
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
but like the weather's

2153
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
absolute rubbish

2154
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
like it is rubbish

2155
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
we're capital R

2156
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
and

2157
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
so we haven't really been able to do anything

2158
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
and it just feels

2159
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
not like it's a waste because he gets

2160
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
like a holiday offer working that

2161
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
but yeah it's just a bit

2162
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
he wants me to learn to drive

2163
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
like excuse me

2164
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
every time

2165
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
do you not see my amazing bike out there

2166
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
that bike cost me like

2167
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
300 dollars and it doesn't

2168
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
cost any fuel

2169
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I don't have to do maintenance I don't have to pay road tax

2170
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
like I'm sorry but why would I learn to

2171
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
drive when my bike gets me from A to B

2172
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
so I'm actually a bike simp I don't care what anyone says

2173
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
I'm here for my bike

2174
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I love my bike I love riding bikes

2175
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
okay I said it

2176
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
I said it I love

2177
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I freaking love my bike I do

2178
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
it makes me happy

2179
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
okay

2180
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
so no it's those papa cuttles

2181
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
but I'm legit not learning to drive

2182
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I'm reading I miss trains

2183
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
she's just like me for real for real

2184
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I'm sorry I'm like so much fun on my bike

2185
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
and like I get to feel the wind through my hair

2186
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
and I get to like I don't know

2187
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
I think I appreciate it because I'm aware that like

2188
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
not everyone's in good enough health to like ride

2189
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
a bike and I get to like have a fantastic

2190
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
time like the wind sweeps

2191
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
through my hair I get from A to B like so fast

2192
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I don't have to like

2193
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
be on like I don't go on roads

2194
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
because it's too dangerous for me to be on a road

2195
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
so as illegit as even on the bike I would get

2196
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
mowed down in like milliseconds

2197
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
and because I'm just so bad

2198
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
oh that was I didn't even

2199
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
I'm just rambling I'm being honest

2200
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I'm not really playing right now

2201
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
and

2202
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
like I'd literally get hit by a car

2203
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
so quickly if I was on the road so I'm not

2204
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
and I go on the pavements okay I said what

2205
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I said I go on the pavements what you're gonna do about it

2206
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
fart exactly

2207
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
stop giving me tellies and stuff

2208
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
oh there's an orange oh no I should have

2209
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
put orange there oh well

2210
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
look

2211
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
it wouldn't be me if I wasn't

2212
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
messing it up every two seconds that's when

2213
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
you know it's legit gameplay for me

2214
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I get paid to bike you get paid

2215
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
to bike to work

2216
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
is that a thing what can't

2217
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
well don't dox yourself but

2218
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
what country would offer that

2219
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
what country would offer cycle to work

2220
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
and get paid

2221
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
I've not heard about it in Scotland

2222
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
I'm not heard about it in Australia either

2223
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
the Netherlands it's default Germany

2224
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
no

2225
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
I know sorry sorry

2226
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000

2228
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Netherlands

2229
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000

2230
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I'm so sorry

2231
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
reflink but not you being the most stereotypical

2232
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I ride a bike and I'm dodge

01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I'm so sorry

2234
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
but that you can get more stereotypical

2235
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
than that that's hilarious

2236
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
oh bless your cotton socks that's amazing

2237
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
oh you must be so healthy though

2238
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
some German companies do it but it's really rare

2239
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
sound fish not to be confused

2240
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000

2243
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
it looks like a shark that's like angry

2244
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
why is this got muscles

2245
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
why is it got musclies

2246
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
my guess is courier

2247
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
I've been watching oh my god

2248
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I've been making my dad watch delivery videos

2249
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
I watch a guy

2250
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
I think his name's like

2251
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
London eats or something like that

2252
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
and he like does episodes where he

2253
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
oh I've randomly got peach

2254
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
he like does episodes where he like

2255
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
cycles around London delivering

2256
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
and he shows you like how much money he makes

2257
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
and I just find it fascinating that like human

2258
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
powered stuff can like result in money

2259
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
I don't

2260
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
so I find a lot of concepts

2261
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
hard to like accept

2262
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
not accept but to make heads

2263
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I'm completely messing this up

2264
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
focus right purple that's fine

2265
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
purple can go there wait what's going on

2266
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
something things are moving around

2267
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
why is the peach being shoved up

2268
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
did that help

2269
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
or did that hinder I think that might have hindered

2270
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I'm not gonna lie

2271
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
I think I might be in trouble

2272
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
no I was gonna

2273
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
put that in there

2274
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
oh my god sorry

2275
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000

2282
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000

2283
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000

please

2303
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
you didn't like the clapping so it did that instead

2304
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
I am going to spam

2305
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
and see if I can get more than 1,300

2306
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
points just I'm just gonna

2307
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
test it out I'm sure it's been tested a billion

2308
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
times before

2309
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
applause for 1,200

2310
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
but a minimum for one

2311
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I'm just gonna test it out

2312
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I'm just gonna test it out let me test

2313
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
okay

2314
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
testing testing

2315
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I'm just spamming it

2316
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
I mean stuff is

2317
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I was joking about

2318
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I would be better off just not even thinking

2319
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
and putting it through but

2320
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
the allegations

2321
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
I might not be beating them

2322
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
things are

2323
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
things are mashing together by accident

2324
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
she's gonna cry when she gets

2325
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
not we've already got a peach

2326
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
bruh

2327
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
bruh

2328
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
okay okay I think it's gonna stop

2329
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
working because we've got a variety going now

2330
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
but

2331
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
we're at 300 points without

2332
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
even saying bruh

2333
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
we're at

2334
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
500 points without trying I swear

2335
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
if I beat my record doing

2336
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
a tactic like this

2337
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
we're almost at 600

2338
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
we're at 600 points

2339
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
okay okay

2340
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
okay it's fine

2341
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
we're at 700 but we're literally

2342
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
almost half of my record

2343
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
by not trying

2344
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
hold up

2345
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
is this for real

2346
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
why did this kind of work though

2347
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
why did this kind of

2348
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
work though

2349
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
right

2350
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
will I actually try and play

2351
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I literally got

2352
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
1000 not trying are you serious

2353
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
is this like a secret method

2354
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
that I've just discovered or is this like

2355
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
everyone already knows this

2356
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
okay things are

2357
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
bruh

2358
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
bruh

2359
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
am I gonna make

2360
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
more score

2361
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
am I gonna beat

2362
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000

2363
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
no tell

2364
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
it's not true

2365
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
it's not true

2366
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
okay

2367
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
okay right I was gonna say

2368
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
right I'm kinda glad that I threw there

2369
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
I didn't mean to throw I meant to push that apple to the side

2370
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
so it would come together

2371
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
no way

2372
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
no way

2373
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
that was amazing

2374
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
oh my god

2375
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I'm not gonna lie

2376
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
I think that might have actually

2377
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
I'm sorry

2378
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
I'm so sorry

2379
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
can I try that again I wanna try it again

2380
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
but put it in the corner

2381
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
blame RNG

2382
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
honestly I wanna put it in the corner

2383
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
this time

2384
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
1300 points to spam

2385
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I was literally

2386
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
200 off my third place

2387
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
no way this is the

2388
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
freaking methods

2389
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I refuse

2390
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
just spam it down

2391
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
and like here's me try hard

2392
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
in trying to strategize and you're telling me

2393
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
I can just spam and then deal with it on the other end

2394
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
random chance the only thing in this world

2395
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
that is fair and biased

2396
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
it won't be as effective in the corner

2397
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
because there's less randomness for the fruit

2398
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
to sort by size

2399
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
it could be a viable strategy until you get

2400
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
a certain fruit then

2401
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
you can be more strategic

2402
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
accidental

2403
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
sort and strike

2404
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
literally the game's just dealing with itself right now

2405
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
the game's like here let's help out

2406
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
what we at

2407
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
300 okay it looks like the corner doesn't work

2408
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
but the middle seems to work way better

2409
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
yeah the corner isn't

2410
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
like I'll move over

2411
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
if it's gonna

2412
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
no way

2413
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I'm stunned

2414
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
that's

2415
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
that's outrageous

2416
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
sorry that's legit outrageous

2417
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
okay I'll move

2418
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
to the other corner just not to throw

2419
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
like ray of the end

2420
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000

okay

2422
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
well I think I'm gonna have to do it in the middle then

2423
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
I'm not allowed to do strategy

2424
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000

2461
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000

2467
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
to me I feel personally

2468
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
attacked by this rng

2469
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
please do not ever cook again

2470
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
thank you right

2471
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
if we get an apple

2472
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
can you say apple

2473
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000

2474
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
uhhhh

2475
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
just need an apple

2476
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
just need a wee

2477
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
a wee orange

2478
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
will do it to be honest

2479
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
okay yeah an orange like that

2480
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
will do it

2481
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
and then

2482
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
I guess take I don't want to risk it

2483
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
I'm doing the method where I throw everything

2484
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
down the side until I get what I want

2485
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
and of course the apples can't touch now

2486
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
so that's like

2487
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
the apple

2488
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
the apple

2489
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
the apple

2490
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
actually I'm doing a karaoke stream

2491
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
soon I hope you're ready for it

2492
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
my dad literally leaves and then I start streaming

2493
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
out the wazoo again I'm gonna be so depressed

2494
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
so

2495
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
hey apple stop that's what's been

2496
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
literally tearing on the tip

2497
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
of my tongue for ages

2498
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
and I don't want to start it because my brain's gonna start it

2499
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
cut an ear with oh I didn't mean

2500
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
to put that down well

2501
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
hey

2502
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
literally one of the first thing I notice

2503
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
when I got sent to stream of yours is how funny

2504
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
we're not hating your frustration when bothered in a game

2505
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
oh me just raging

2506
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
in the game this is unplayable

2507
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
I can't play this

2508
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
yeah yeah that's my streamer right there

2509
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000

2511
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
that's funny though I'll take it

2512
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
things are moving

2513
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
things are moving

2514
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
things are moving

2515
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000

2516
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000

let's not throw

2566
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
I mean it's the same on both sides really

2567
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
other than that one's a blockade

2568
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
but

2569
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
it's my blockade to make

2570
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
um

2571
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
things are moving slightly

2572
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
things are experiencing gravity

2573
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
the laws of

2574
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
gravity

2575
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
in the world

2576
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
is turning

2577
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
inside out

2578
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
you

2579
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
200 degrees

2580
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
that's not the words at all

2581
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
and hard to see

2582
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
so don't

2583
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
stop the fruit

2584
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
now

2585
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
don't

2586
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
stop kissing fruit together

2587
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
because they're having a good time

2588
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
having a good time

2589
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000

maybe no

2595
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
that probably wasn't what I wanted

2596
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
keep kissing little

2597
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
fruits and then you will be

2598
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
rewarded beyond your mortal comprehension

2599
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000

2600
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000

2601
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
kind of loop

2602
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000

2715
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000

slaysaber I really

2722
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000

01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
sorry some people hate it but I'm like

2725
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
it's so fun to pretend to have a wee winky

2726
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
sorry like

2727
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000

01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
I didn't believe you

2729
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
I promise I'm actually using a method right now

2730
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
this is real I'm using a method

2731
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
I'm tempted to actually just spam

2732
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
until the industry I'm not even kidding

2733
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
this is so fun I love this spam method

2734
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
because I don't actually have to use my brain

2735
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
or be tactical

2736
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
sorry this is a gameplay that I'm here for

2737
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
not having to think

2738
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
not having to think look all of us can just

2739
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
ink and none of us have to think

2740
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
that's the way I like it

2741
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
stop being so blatant

2742
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I've been so blatant recently

2743
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
why am I getting limited ads on some of

2744
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
my streams

2745
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
I don't mean this

2746
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
no wonder you like Sigmund Freud

2747
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000

I think I've bolzed it up

2761
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
I've bolzed up my tactic

2762
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
unless the game said

2763
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with thee

2764
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
sorry I shouldn't use that

2765
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
blasphemous terms

2766
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000

2780
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I mean I'm loving it I'm here for it

2781
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
if I put the orange theirs are gonna bounce off

2782
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
yeah it bounces off of course it does because why wouldn't it

2783
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
okay okay okay

2784
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
hit him with a him with a

2785
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
right we're gonna put that there and then we're gonna put purple here

2786
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
oh no I could have

2787
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
oh no this can't be I messed up

2788
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
but it's okay

2789
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
I mess up often but just because you mess up

2790
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
it doesn't mean you're not allowed to keep trying

2791
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
like geez

2792
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
don't judge yourself so heavily remember

2793
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
you look at yourself through a lens heavier

2794
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
than anyone else ever does

2795
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
only you'll notice things that make you cringe

2796
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
but people will never think about it in their life ever again

2797
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
so don't be afraid to be cringe

2798
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
it's okay big bros you can tell

2799
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
me how much you

2800
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
sorry

2801
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
that was so specific

2802
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
right

2803
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
what happens here okay that's fine

2804
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
we can deal with that

2805
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
okay that's fine and then we're gonna put an orange here

2806
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
then we're gonna put

2807
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
a thing

2808
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
literally the big bros been worried about

2809
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
engaging with Amy and I'm like

2810
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
bro I literally made her

2811
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
well I made her lore

2812
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
but everything else she does

2813
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
is by her own accord

2814
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
I do not tell the girls to do nothing

2815
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
so

2816
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
I don't know why you're cringing

2817
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
be free be yourself

2818
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
to be cringe is to be free unironically

2819
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
as I said you're the only person

2820
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
that will ever care

2821
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
and look at yourself through

2822
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
such a severe lens

2823
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
just enjoy life

2824
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
literally unironically you'll know

2825
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
please mr. Apple

2826
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
you do this to me every time

2827
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
you actually do this to me

2828
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
every time I'm starting to think it's

2829
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
are you

2830
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
that can't be right I'm being

2831
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
trolled

2832
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
well someone better

2833
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
start moving because I'm not playing

2834
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
another go

2835
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
someone better start moving

2836
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
because it's no me

2837
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
okay

2838
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
okay

2839
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
aha

2840
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
aha

2841
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I'm in trouble

2842
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
a strover actually

2843
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
I do like damn apples

2844
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
oh

2845
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
I was actually pretty good

2846
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I'll give you that

2847
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
I was actually pretty good

2848
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
I blinked in the box got filled

2849
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
these are just high player strats

2850
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
your brain just can't comprehend

2851
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
how MLG Pro

2852
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
what's up scrawny

2853
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
me sucking at this game

2854
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
what's that

2855
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
no stop showing me the rankings

2856
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
I'm getting embarrassed how much I'm being

2857
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
outplayed by these rankings seriously

2858
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
I mean

2859
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
there's nothing I can do

2860
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
I've made everything worse

2861
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
okay

2862
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
right one more give me one more chance

2863
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
surely I can get watermelon

2864
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
before the industry surely

2865
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
no don't play that

2866
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
freaking SFX I don't know fucking far

2867
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
SFX I don't even know what I would call that

2868
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
right

2869
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
this method clearly works I don't care

2870
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
what anyone says oh my god they're stacking

2871
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
so pretty

2872
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
I actually enjoyed the way they were stacking

2873
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
just one more just one more

2874
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
give me one more just one

2875
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
more chance

2876
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
I don't know the words

2877
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
but don't that's not gonna stop me

2878
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
far

2879
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
hard

2880
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
scored.mp3

2881
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
literally you could have done worse

2882
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
honestly this method works

2883
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
I think I just suck that this method

2884
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
works so well for me

2885
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
I mean obviously

2886
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
naturally things will start

2887
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
pop a lock in so I guess

2888
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
like it's only bound to happen

2889
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
but it's just like

2890
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
use brain

2891
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
or just have fun

2892
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
spamming

2893
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
and things work out in the end

2894
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
okay maybe not this one the RNG on this one

2895
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
maybe maybe not

2896
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
oh no they oh

2897
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
oh

2898
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
okay I'm happy

2899
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
please get the watermelon I want to sleep

2900
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
no no replaying you can go to sleep

2901
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
there's no way I'm getting the watermelon

2902
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
I want the watermelon

2903
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
oh yeah it's all coming together

2904
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
it's working what do you mean

2905
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
okay it kind of

2906
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
doesn't work near the end where I have less room

2907
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
yeah unless like things

2908
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
start doing that then

2909
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
I mean things are shuffling about though

2910
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
like maybe I just need to give it time to like

2911
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
talk about

2912
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
well stuff is happening

2913
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
wow

2914
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
like things are

2915
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
popping and locking

2916
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
you know

2917
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
that's what I should do just spam it at the start

2918
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
and then actually try hard at the end

2919
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
being like oh yeah no no I was trying hard in the whole time

2920
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
what are you talking about

2921
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
I was trying hard in the whole time

2922
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
this is pure skill

2923
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
sorry I'm watching myself play on OBS

2924
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
I'm not even looking forward like this

2925
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
I'm like that's not a view

2926
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
who let her cook

2927
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
it's working okay I'm not in the kitchen all the time

2928
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
but it's actually working for real

2929
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
so it's

2930
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
yeah okay it's working until it's not

2931
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
don't play the far I will

2932
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
literally mute the in-game audio

2933
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
don't think I won't

2934
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
maybe spam to halfway or the first pineapple

2935
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
okay okay okay okay I'll hear you

2936
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
I'll hear you that might work

2937
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
right until we get the spam until we

2938
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
get a pineapple

2939
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
okay spam until

2940
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
we get pineapple and then I'll take over

2941
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
and actually use my brain deal

2942
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
deal

2943
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
okay pineapple I'm coming

2944
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
for you

2945
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
RNG gods

2946
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
you better be with me

2947
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
okay they actually

2948
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
kind of are with me for real

2949
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
nothing like accidentally

2950
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
bumping off of each other

2951
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
there's a bump in right we've got

2952
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
cantaloupe we're about to get peach

2953
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
oh until unless I did that

2954
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
then that was a bit selfish of me but hey

2955
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
I'm late no don't worry

2956
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000

me even though it's like

2960
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
three hours away

2961
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
it's a zero maybe if a zero's waiting room's

2962
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
off I'll redirect into a zero's waiting

2963
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
room because we're gonna play

2964
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
forever early if she comes online

2965
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
she's not online right now

2966
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
she's passed out sleeping

2967
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000

me me me

2970
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
maybe I should

2971
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
like let it relax

2972
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
into stuff because I just blocked

2973
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
myself from doing something there and I'm like

2974
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
if I let it relax

2975
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
then

2976
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
yeah

2977
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I

2978
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
also have a collab with AC coming up

2979
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
I convinced her to play a puzzle game with me

2980
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
she's like no I don't want to play a puzzle

2981
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
game and I'm like

2982
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
oh but it's easy AC don't worry

2983
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
I'll carry you through and she's like

2984
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
I'll find them strong

2985
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
even so I've got that

2986
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
to look forward to

2987
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
and then

2988
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I just need to collab with Shebe and

2989
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Emi and then I've at least done a one on one

2990
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
collab with everyone and viewer

2991
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
which was my goal

2992
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
and

2993
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
okay I balls

2994
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
that up no

2995
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
why does it work sometimes

2996
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
and then other times it doesn't

2997
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
things are rubbing and touching

2998
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
but nothing's popping and locking you know what I'm saying

2999
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
wait

3000
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
something's happening whoa

3001
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
okay

3002
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
we're moving

3003
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
now if the peaches can kiss

3004
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
do it kiss right now

3005
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
no it's pure aren't you

3006
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
lowly monster

3007
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
why is AC on the make

3008
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
she's so adorable

3009
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
I love her

3010
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
okay okay we got pineapple as I said

3011
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
I'm trying to try harder now

3012
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
and orange so we want it to land on top

3013
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
of the apple which of course

3014
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
due to how small brain

3015
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
I am that didn't work

3016
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
that's okay

3017
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
now we have an orange

3018
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
next which we're actually

3019
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I think we're forced to play it

3020
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
I think we're forced to play it here to make an

3021
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
apple oh no

3022
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
but it's not heavy enough

3023
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
no

3024
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000

no what

3027
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
I don't think we can do anything

3028
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
I think we're just in trouble

3029
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
oh

3030
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000

01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
I'm gonna have to put it in the middle

3033
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
if I put

3034
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
an orange

3035
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
here

3036
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
of course it gives me a freaking orange

3037
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
after that are you serious

3038
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
it gives me two

3039
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
the RNG gods clearly

3040
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
hate me it's okay you can

3041
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000

01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
right let's try that

3043
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
this isn't gonna work

3044
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
it's ogre

3045
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
it's ogre

3046
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
no why is this game so hard

3047
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
why is this so hard

3048
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
the game just pushed me out

3049
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
no it's gonna play the freaking it

3050
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
right one more try one more try one more try

3051
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
it literally pushed me out

3052
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
any far on me

3053
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
it literally pushed me out

3054
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
apple but I didn't know you had

3055
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
a bikini toggle oh did you just

3056
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
see my short

3057
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
I do have a bikini toggle

3058
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
and

3059
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
you guys weren't supposed to know

3060
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
about it until later but I had the key

3061
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
bindings on my keyboard and I

3062
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
flashed stream like twice

3063
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
in a bikini

3064
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
which was ridiculous

3065
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
because everyone was like

3066
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
someone commented they're like oh yeah you totally meant

3067
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
that by mistake

3068
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
and I was like no motherfucker

3069
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
if I meant that on purpose

3070
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
I would have done it on debut for the easy

3071
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
fucking clips and clicks like

3072
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
you're welcome you know that's when

3073
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
you know it's not fucking staged because I

3074
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
cannot tell you how many vtubers I've seen

3075
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
that staged a debut and then

3076
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
all of a sudden oh no

3077
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
my clothes disappear

3078
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
oh it was an accident

3079
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
and it's like obviously for fucking clicks

3080
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
like doesn't it be so obvious

3081
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
I'm sorry

3082
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
but I don't know if it's because I'm Scottish and I'm so cynical

3083
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
sometimes

3084
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
but it's so fucking obvious when someone does that

3085
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
tactic and I'm like bro you're actually

3086
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
you're actually so obvious

3087
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
I don't know why we're pretending otherwise

3088
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
fine just say you're doing it for clicks

3089
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
that's how you have you play the freaking

3090
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
like vtuber game

3091
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
like bro

3092
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
I just found it it took so long to

3093
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
realise oh you guys don't watch my

3094
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
shorts uh freaking

3095
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
um Arisa

3096
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
not Arisa from Overwatch actually

3097
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
speaking of Overwatch the new character came out

3098
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000

3099

01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000

um

3103
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
that was a primal scream

3104
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
oh I did not mean

3105
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
to do it I absolutely did not mean to do it

3106
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
so if anyone's like oh my god

tiktok acting or something

3111
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000

3116
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
and she's a pilot

3117
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
and she's a healer

3118
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000

right now

3123
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
I don't know when she comes out

3124
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
but she got announced

3125
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
um

3126
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
we have a pineapple

3127
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
honestly

3128
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
right

3129
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
don't give me wee ones

3130
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
give me big ones

3131
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000

3132
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000

3133
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
stop

3134
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
we're up gonna re-download

3135
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
well I think we can do like 10 lobbies

3136
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
together as well in Overwatch

3137
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
sorry I know people like to shiz on it

3138
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
but I mean

3139
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
it's kind of a good game to stream

3140
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
snipe on

3141
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
did I mess that up? I did

3142
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
that's okay

3143
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
it's okay cause I like ruining the game

3144
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
I constantly throw by accident

3145
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
now if you wanted to claim

3146
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
I'm thrown on purpose

3147
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
I'll say that you've got some merit cause I'm so

3148
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
freaking dumb that I keep doing it

I want an apple there so it's just bing ching

3337
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000

3338
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
to get where I want to go

3339
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000

and we'll put an orange

3342
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
and then that should turn into an orange

3343
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000

02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000

02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
you know it's kind of hard

3369
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
just to get along today

3370
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
shit

3371
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
they asked for a 13 yeah

3372
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
instead they drew a 31

3373
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
they say he's trying too hard

3374
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
and it's not quite him

3375
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
that's a pretty thing

3376
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
give it to me

3377
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
whoo please don't push me out

3378
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
that's not very nice you're giving me a heart attack

3379
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
I'm stressed

3380
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
I'm stressed

3381
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
I'm stressed I've just resorted to singing now

3382
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
actually stressed in 4k

3383
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
okay

3384
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
uh huh

3385
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
um

3386
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
I think I'm out of room

3387
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
and I can't make anything kiss

3388
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
if those peaches could have kissed

3389
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
I mean

3390
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
shit

3391
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
that actually wasn't that bad

3392
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
for the last attempt though

3393
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
I'm not even mad like I'm not

3394
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
sorry but my chair can't be mad at that

3395
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
yeah

3396
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
there's not much I can do at this stage

3397
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
it's ogre

3398
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
it's actually ogre but

3399
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
god damn did we have a good run

3400
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
yeah god that was a good run

3401
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
and I got second place

3402
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
that was my second place record

3403
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
that was good

3404
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
that was so good

3405
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
I'm not even mad

3406
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
I'm not even mad I'm raging

3407
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
but I'm not even mad that was so good

3408
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
clap clap clap

3409
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
that was really wasn't that bad

3410
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
right how would I rate suika

3411
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
um

3412
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
if you want my honest opinion

3413
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
I'm not gonna be playing this again on stream

3414
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
if you want my honest opinion

3415
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
I'm not gonna be playing this off stream either

3416
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
it's fine there's nothing wrong with the game

3417
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
there's absolutely nothing wrong with the game

3418
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
it's just slightly too casual

3419
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
I don't know

3420
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
I say that as if I don't literally get you carrying me

3421
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
in Elden Ring but

3422
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
I have to admit even I'm like

3423
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
I'm squinting me right now

3424
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
I'm squinting me right now

3425
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
I'm squinting me right now

3426
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
it'll settle with looking at your premade ones

3427
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
my premade melons how do

3428
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
how do

3429
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
right so sheebie isn't on but emi might be on later

3430
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
let me just check

3431
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
I'll redirect into her

3432
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
if she isn't on

3433
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
then I will

3434
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
nope she's not on

3435
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
then Azura I will redirect

3436
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
into Azura's room

3437
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
yes okay she does have it off

3438
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
now we might be an hour early

3439
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
but if she's still asleep then it'll be the usual time

3440
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
I know literally sheebie's on vacation

3441
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
so I can't redirect her to her

3442
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
emi's just came back she's getting into the swing of things again

3443
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
there's nothing until you collab with Azura

3444
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
okay yes

3445
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
how are you doing

3446
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
sorry that was a stretch I don't know why I made that so weird

3447
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
maybe I'm just

3448
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
I'm a freak

3449
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
I'm a weird

3450
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
joke I'm a bit of playdough

3451
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
I'm getting ready for carry

3452
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
okay now I'm even freaking got the stream up

3453
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
in the waiting room for it up

3454
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
right I'm gonna redirect into Azura's POV

3455
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
of the collab that's in two hours

3456
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
I'm gonna go lie down for a nap

3457
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
mummy did you ever talk about needing permission for a short

3458
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
yes oh right

3459
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
okay so reflins be completely

3460
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
and wholeheartedly honest

3461
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
you can either use Marshmallow for feedback or not

3462
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
so on the

3463
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
vealer youtube channel

3464
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
the announcement trailer got 100k views

3465
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
the reason

3466
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
that it got picked up in

3467
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
the algorithm

3468
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
is because it was reported

3469
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
by a news channel which

3470
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
is ran by a male

3471
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
and obviously we follow idle culture

3472
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
now I was going to do a behind the scenes

3473
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
talking about how

3474
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
why your

3475
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
VTuber goes nuts when they make the news

3476
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
is because there's a clear correlation

3477
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
of being on VTuber news

3478
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
and then like the views or whatever

3479
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
now I was gonna do a breakdown

3480
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
short about it however

3481
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
I didn't want to do it if it would upset anyone

3482
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
so I do want you to be honest

3483
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
I don't want me to talk about it

3484
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
I'm more than happy to just

3485
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
bend that short idea

3486
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
but it is talking about VTuber news

3487
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
and in particular one

3488
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
that is ran by a guy

3489
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
which is why the vealer

3490
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
announcement trailer of the agency

3491
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
got trending if you can see on the website

3492
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
it's literally got almost 100k views

3493
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
so I just

3494
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
didn't want to do anything that upsets you guys

3495
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
but I was gonna talk about why your VTuber gets excited

3496
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
and then I was gonna show like correlation between

3497
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
the

3498
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
video getting traction

3499
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
where it got mentioned

3500
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
and then why VTubers are so thankful

3501
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
to be mentioned on the news

3502
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
it's alright wait why would we get upset

3503
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
ran by a guy mail on stream

3504
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
I know we're teasing but I just don't want to do

3505
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
anything that would upset you guys

3506
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
but please do use Marshmallow as well

3507
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
if you'd rather give anonymous feedback

3508
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
that's more than anything

3509
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
I'm here for you

3510
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
you do you

3511
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
just because it's a bit more of a behind the scenes

3512
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
on the VTuber aspect than it is

3513
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
about anything else of that degree

3514
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
it sounds okay

3515
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
now if I did it

3516
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
anyone would freak out about that has bigger problems

3517
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
person that sounds like I see no issue

3518
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
yeah it's more like a behind the scenes

3519
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
angle it's not like oh my god

3520
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
slob on the knob like it's nothing like that

3521
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
nah I'm the opposite girls

3522
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
I want to see men

3523
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
hmm

3524
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
it's okay right as long as you guys are sure

3525
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
I'll make sure it's completely

3526
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
above board to the best my ability but again

3527
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
you can use my

3528
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Marshmallow as well for a bit of feedback

3529
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
but it's not focused

3530
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
around that it's the

3531
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
the subject title is

3532
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
why do VTubers get so

3533
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
excited being mentioned in the news

3534
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
and then I was going to explain

3535
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
the Vealer trailer got trending

3536
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
and then I was going to ask some VTubers

3537
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
that have been in the news

3538
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
if they had a correlation

3539
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
as well

3540
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
that knob might sound cool

3541
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
you're overthinking it

3542
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
I just don't want to upset anyone

3543
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
what is Marshmallow

3544
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Marshmallow is in the link below

3545
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
in the description below

3546
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
and you can send me anonymous

3547
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
remarks now if you don't have Firefox

3548
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
which has an auto translate thing

3549
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
you can add on

3550
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
it's in Japanese

3551
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
in Japanese

3552
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
so what I'm hearing is

3553
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
if you do something newsworthy

3554
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
and have some evidence that mentions

3555
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Vealer

3556
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
basically Vealer made the news for the first agency

3557
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
and then the trailer

3558
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
got trending because it got mentioned

3559
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
it wasn't trending before

3560
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
originally I was putting advertisement money to show it off

3561
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
but then it wasn't needed

3562
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
go for it the behind the scenes stuff is the best

3563
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
as long as you guys are okay

3564
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
I wonder what news it was

3565
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Sky News Australia? No

3566
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
I still think there are people who think

3567
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
she talks to Marshmallows during her free time

3568
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
I talk to my Marshmallows

3569
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
I read my Marshmallows

3570
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
actually I do have a request for you guys

3571
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
to send me

3572
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
to send me stuff

3573
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
um

3574
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
um

3575
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
um

3576
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
um

3577
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
um

3578
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
what kind of stuff?

3579
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
um

3580
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
when

3581
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
I want to make some twitter

3582
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
audios

3583
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
but I need motivation

3584
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
and record again

3585
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
so if you ever wanted to send

3586
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
some stuff

3587
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
I mean you can't

3588
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
and then I could use it

3589
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
okay

3590
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
I will leave it there

3591
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
I'm gonna redirect into Azur's little waiting room

3592
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
please do watch Azur's P.E.O.V

3593
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
um

3594
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
actually you can watch us both at the same time

3595
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
to see what we're dealing with

3596
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
I'm an idiot you can literally watch them both at the same time

3597
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
since we're only talking to each other

3598
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
um

3599
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
as long as it's not for Gamba

3600
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
nyaaa

3601
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
what's wrong with Baltro?

3602
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
I like Baltro

3603
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Baltro's good

3604
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Baltro good game

3605
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
alright

3606
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
I'm not being funny

3607
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
but the girls get

3608
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
so much more hate words

3609
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Marshmallows than I do

3610
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
I get like one or two

3611
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
just because I've not been posting on my alt twitter

3612
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
I think if I start posting on my alt twitter

3613
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
then

3614
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
you know I'll start to reap the rewards

3615
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
if you will

3616
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
um

3617
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
so give me let me cook

3618
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
I've got a few things cooking

3619
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
but yeah if you wanted to be

3620
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
motivational for no particular reason

3621
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
in like a weeks time

3622
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
feel free to use marshmallows

3623
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
I'll keep one on the burger and Gamba

3624
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
and I'll respond to them to get traction

3625
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
how dare you I can't believe it

3626
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
right I'll do a compilation soon TM

3627
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
I just can't do it right now

3628
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
cause then you really want to start describing

3629
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
about how I want to be collared and leashed

3630
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
and like walked around like a dog and then my dad's like

3631
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
what are you doing?

3632
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
and I'm like nothing nothing nothing

3633
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
and I'll start like closing down all my tabs in a panic

3634
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
yeah no don't really want to

3635
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
don't really want to do that

3636
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
rather weird rather strange

3637
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
okay

3638
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
um

3639
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
I will redirect into Azura

3640
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
but we're both going to be online at the same time

3641
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
we're either going to be an hour early

3642
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
or the hour specified

3643
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Azura is asleep right now so I'm not going to

3644
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
you know wake up Azura

3645
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
I'm not going to be like batter

3646
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
batter entire room like Azura

3647
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
time to do puzzle

3648
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
like no she's asleep

3649
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
if she's asleep she's asleep

3650
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
either regular time or one hour earlier

3651
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
okay but don't worry

3652
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000

3653
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000

thank you for enjoying the fruit game with me

pretty coo-ai-ne out there

3658
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
maybe we should do a drunk stream where I can't

3659
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
I'm not allowed to go offline until I get a war mill

3660
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
maybe that would be a funnier twist

3661
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
but thank you very much little reeflings

3662
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
