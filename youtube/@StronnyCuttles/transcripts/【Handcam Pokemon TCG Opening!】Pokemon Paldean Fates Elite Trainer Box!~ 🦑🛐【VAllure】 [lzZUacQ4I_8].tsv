0	12000	I'm not prepared for this thing.
12000	17000	I'm slinging gmods with a girl.
17000	21000	I'm trying to keep a good body in me.
21000	23000	Like we did in each one.
23000	25000	My face in the screen?
25000	27000	Yeah, it looks like the surfaces.
27000	29000	There we have it.
29000	31000	There we have it.
31000	33000	And this is also my cat.
33000	37000	The cat that we're using.
37000	41000	And this one is my dog.
41000	43000	My cat.
43000	45000	It's looking good.
45000	47000	It's looking good.
47000	49000	It is looking good.
49000	51000	It is looking good.
51000	53000	You didn't work in?
53000	55000	This is what you think, Borschti.
55000	57000	I'm just kidding.
57000	59000	Why am I a bruh?
59000	61000	It's an only bot lane, you know.
61000	63000	Hi!
63000	67000	Do you want to see where I still owns my fucking
67000	69000	unnamed seat collection?
69000	71000	Ray here!
71000	79000	I get to ruin all those samples that I took, so yeah, I spelt them all with my opnion samples, and I spelt them, so...
81000	86000	No, as a rule of thumb, the likelihood of me showing my face in the screen is very fucking high.
86000	88000	Am I gonna apologize? No.
91000	97000	I didn't really get much time to say oh, it's a clean Gmod with the girls.
97000	100000	So, we have this.
100000	103000	Hi mom, I can't get more than I'm good.
103000	106000	Your immersion is getting ruined, unfortunately.
106000	117000	As I said, the likelihood of a reflective surface showing my bald GI balls is pretty high, so if you don't want to acknowledge that I am a woman, then you are more than welcome to check out our screen.
117000	119000	This is not the screen for you.
119000	121000	We are opening.
121000	126000	Paladin's face in my barber.
126000	128000	Can you hear me?
128000	129000	Hoodie up.
129000	130000	Oh, you wanna put Hoodie up?
130000	132000	It's actually really smart.
132000	133000	Hold on a minute.
133000	135000	Women on the screen?
135000	136000	Green blanket.
136000	138000	What does that mean?
138000	141000	If I can even get into the spot.
141000	154000	So, I have this as well, which we're gonna put away the ones we get in the correct order.
154000	157000	Have a face mask.
157000	159000	I don't have one.
159000	168000	I'm having a show so the microphone picks me up because the microphone is now right here.
168000	169000	Yeah.
169000	171000	I just thought we'd do some gambler.
171000	172000	Go gambling.
172000	174000	Aw, dang it.
174000	177000	The real gambler was trying to open the box to see if he knew.
177000	179000	Do you think?
179000	181000	This is so reflective of that's the way to happen.
181000	184000	I mean, to be honest.
184000	190000	To be honest, I just look like a depressed fucking, you know, golf ad, really.
190000	191000	Not that I am depressed.
191000	193000	It's just I'm depressed.
193000	194000	No, I'm not depressed.
194000	195000	No, that's what I'm trying to say.
195000	196000	I'm not depressed.
196000	200000	Just, I look depressed on first.
200000	202000	Oh, shame you.
202000	209000	Oh, what's going on?
209000	212000	Now hold on a minute.
212000	213000	The leg.
213000	217000	Yeah, pulling.
217000	220000	Maybe the real gambler was the one you were looking for.
220000	225000	I am just in this to relive what I want in my childhood.
225000	227000	I cannot miss the shame of things.
227000	229000	I'm actually in my time.
229000	232000	What is this?
232000	234000	This thing?
234000	237000	Oh, let's see then.
237000	239000	And this is the coin flip.
239000	240000	This one is the coin flip.
240000	243000	There's the two.
243000	246000	Where's the refling card?
246000	248000	I will get it though.
248000	251000	Oh, this is like something I can make.
252000	258000	Oh, it's like I thought it was metal.
258000	262000	Classbook.
262000	265000	TCG car truck simulators came out by the way.
265000	266000	Hold on.
266000	267000	Let me recalibrate.
267000	268000	I'm going to do it.
268000	270000	So, do you know how to do it?
270000	273000	You step on it.
273000	278000	I may as well go some higher.
278000	279000	Yes, unfortunately.
279000	281000	Well, not unfortunately.
281000	285000	I was playing Gmod.
285000	287000	Where's the girl?
287000	289000	So, I didn't have much time to set this up.
289000	292000	So, I'm a bit...
292000	296000	Can you tell I've never opened a Pokemon box before?
296000	299000	What am I trying to achieve?
299000	301000	Okay, we have...
301000	304000	Holy shitele.
304000	305000	We have basic decks.
305000	307000	I assume this is not the gambler.
307000	311000	Oh my god, shame you.
311000	313000	So, this isn't the gambler.
313000	317000	I assume these big pre-made stacks are decks, not gambler.
317000	320000	And then it comes with its own pocket.
320000	325000	So, if we get a really good card,
325000	328000	it comes with its own pocket of notes.
328000	330000	And then...
330000	333000	So, if we get good cards, we'll put them in there.
333000	337000	And then we've got...
337000	339000	What is that? Open five?
344000	348000	Any Pokemon enthusiasts know what this is called?
348000	350000	The big stack is all energy cards?
350000	352000	Are you serious?
352000	356000	Why would they give you that?
356000	358000	I don't know why.
358000	361000	It's a deck to Vador.
361000	363000	No.
363000	366000	Look at you, you little nerd.
366000	369000	Answered all our questions.
369000	374000	Okay, I assume the gambler is these.
374000	378000	This is what the gambler is.
378000	383000	Oh, sorry. Let me spread it for you.
383000	385000	All name gambler.
385000	387000	This is why we're here.
387000	389000	This is the money shop, people.
389000	391000	The money shop.
391000	393000	The gambler.
393000	395000	Right, what one do you want first?
395000	397000	Let's spread it.
397000	401000	Excuse my seat collection.
401000	403000	What have we got?
403000	406000	God, I don't even recognise half of these Pokemon.
406000	408000	Oh, God, I should have picked an old school pack.
408000	410000	There's Pikachu.
410000	412000	There's a pink thing.
412000	413000	There's a blue thing.
413000	414000	There's a whale.
414000	417000	What one do you want?
417000	419000	Show me the card.
419000	421000	Why are they so big?
421000	423000	Why are they so big in your hands?
423000	427000	That's a booster pack in your hand.
427000	429000	You want the pink one?
429000	431000	You want the pink one?
431000	433000	I'll give you the pink one.
433000	435000	I think there might be a code inside.
435000	437000	So if you play the online game, sure.
437000	438000	You can grab the code.
438000	441000	There's only the difference to me.
441000	443000	Tinkerton.
443000	445000	Tinkerton.
446000	448000	Put your phone.
448000	450000	It's just tiny hands.
450000	452000	Thank you for this set.
452000	454000	Dainan.
454000	455000	M&S.
455000	456000	Oh, God.
456000	457000	Hold on.
457000	459000	Did we think about the real challenge about this stream?
459000	461000	Opening the pack?
461000	463000	Or literally opening them?
463000	465000	I can't do that.
465000	468000	Am I going to need scissors?
468000	469000	What the hell?
469000	470000	Are these factories?
470000	474000	Is this not for children?
474000	476000	Um...
476000	478000	I just...
478000	479000	Bruh, hold on.
479000	480000	I'm getting confused.
480000	482000	I'm talking to the show now.
482000	484000	I'm not...
492000	494000	You were playing with me saying that.
494000	496000	So I'm going to get you ready to take over the stream.
496000	499000	Okay, first quiz.
499000	501000	Obtain...
501000	503000	the card opener.
503000	505000	Look, you remember when I said the nail glue one
505000	507000	and I needed scissors?
507000	511000	The nail glue got stuck to the scissors.
511000	513000	Ladrian.
513000	515000	Thank you for the extended membership two months.
515000	517000	Our having small hands is great.
517000	519000	Make other things bigger.
519000	521000	Right, we're going to make sure
521000	523000	we're not actually only cutting the top of the card.
523000	527000	So as you can see, I'm using my finger as a gaze.
530000	532000	Is that the result we wanted?
533000	535000	Seeing those Pokemon packs
535000	537000	and knowing the size of them,
537000	539000	you really have tiny, adorable hands.
539000	541000	They look massive in your hands.
541000	543000	More than you know.
543000	545000	Whatever Brian is saying, I do not endorse.
545000	547000	Right, first gamble.
547000	550000	Okay, this is the code.
550000	553000	If you're a gamer online,
553000	556000	note yourself out.
556000	558000	If you want to focus,
558000	561000	so the QR codes are rich and durable.
562000	564000	There you go.
564000	566000	There you go again.
566000	568000	Right, I didn't even go.
568000	570000	Seeing those Pokemon packs
570000	572000	and knowing the size of them,
572000	574000	you really have tiny, adorable hands.
574000	576000	They look massive.
576000	578000	I'm actually just so big.
578000	580000	Is this the one where it's like
580000	582000	put two from the back to the front
582000	584000	and then, I don't know,
584000	586000	open the pack,
586000	588000	fill the code in one card to the front.
588000	590000	This one to the front.
590000	592000	Okay.
592000	594000	Are you ready?
594000	596000	Oh yeah, I got an energy.
596000	598000	I'm so excited.
598000	600000	You got elephants.
602000	604000	No, you need to focus webcam.
604000	606000	Please.
606000	608000	We're gambling.
608000	610000	We're gambling.
610000	612000	Thank you.
612000	614000	What the fuck is that?
616000	618000	That's not technical.
618000	620000	Alright, I should have went old school with this.
620000	622000	I should have went old school.
622000	624000	Leechonk.
624000	626000	Leechonk, onk, onk, onk.
626000	628000	Okay.
628000	630000	Ooh, I like ganga.
630000	632000	I like you.
632000	634000	I like that pun.
636000	638000	You got technic on the tree.
638000	640000	Crisis punch.
640000	642000	It's emotional speed.
642000	644000	You got...
644000	646000	What does that do?
646000	648000	Dash bun?
648000	650000	Dash bun?
650000	652000	Wait, is this the part?
652000	654000	Hold on.
654000	656000	Wait, can I do this thing?
656000	658000	Can I do this thing that all the streamers do
658000	660000	when they get something like a really good pool?
660000	662000	Is it a good pool?
664000	666000	Oh my god.
666000	668000	Oh my god, I can't believe it.
670000	672000	There's one good card in this pack.
672000	674000	Oh!
674000	676000	What does that mean?
676000	678000	Oh, oh, oh.
678000	680000	Right.
680000	682000	He's shining, so we're going to...
682000	684000	We are going to night him
684000	686000	with one of these,
686000	688000	of the Static Force on his leg.
688000	690000	We're going to have to put him in here.
690000	692000	You go.
692000	694000	What is you?
694000	696000	I told the crew.
696000	698000	So it's a tentacle, but not a tentacle.
698000	700000	Don't be distracted.
700000	702000	It's not a tentacle, but not a tentacle.
702000	704000	Why should I throw it into the camera?
704000	706000	Because I don't know if it's a tentacle.
706000	708000	We just slayed it in,
708000	710000	and then we can get a perfect breed
710000	712000	when we sell this.
712000	714000	Oh yeah.
714000	716000	We just slayed it in.
716000	718000	You know you guys still have another couple of irons
718000	720000	to do when you're still on 2D?
720000	722000	I don't know.
722000	724000	It's such a good one.
724000	726000	It's just a little tentacle.
726000	728000	You can...
728000	730000	You can freak it out if you get a special artwork card.
730000	732000	I'm going to put him
732000	734000	to the side again.
734000	736000	And we got Haunter!
736000	738000	Ah!
738000	740000	We got Holo!
740000	742000	Ah!
742000	744000	Look at that.
744000	746000	Mmm.
746000	748000	Mmm.
748000	750000	Let's go down blue.
750000	752000	Do I put a Holo
752000	754000	in the shiny pocket as well?
754000	756000	Or is this a reverse?
756000	760000	Haunter and Gengar in sameSceneHackDane.
760000	762000	How appropriate that first two could be.
762000	764000	For the tentacles.
764000	766000	Is this pre-recorded?
766000	768000	Exactly.
768000	770000	That put in a wee aslonee punch.
770000	772000	I bet it's Husky and Snacky.
772000	774000	You're winning?
774000	776000	Okay, good.
776000	778000	I'm going to put all my wee shins
778000	780000	in these specials.
780000	782000	There's like tons of these anyway.
782000	784000	I don't know.
784000	791400	So I'll put our pools so far that are good here and then the regular one, we're going
791400	797920	to numeric the deck and then we're going to put it away in the binder the correct way.
797920	801920	Okay pick a card, any card, any pack of yours.
801920	806880	We did just do a tincture tin pack, so maybe we'll do Pikachu?
806880	817280	Pikachu has three, wait there's so many left, yeah this is, that was the first pack that
817280	827240	we opened, we've only opened one pack so far, right, right open, open, right as I said the
827240	832600	cards are at the bottom, my finger is a guide to where the cards start, so I literally can't
832600	838920	put into them, it's not possible, I've seen a few handcams like put into the pack and I'm
838920	846720	like why are you putting into it so willy nilly, believe, believe, open cumin, we don't say
846720	854480	open sesame around these parts, oh no, oh no, two cards stayed in, I don't know what the
854480	862440	order is, order, okay you ready for your card if you play the online game, oh yeah,
862440	871320	look at that, get that code in, get that holographic in the game, mmm yeah, that's great, you deserve
871320	878440	it, right, unfortunately I messed up the opening so I don't know if this truly is where it belongs,
878440	884520	so I'm going to put two in front, are you ready, boom, oh, well that worked out rather well,
884600	890520	that doesn't seem to me, it's the start of the day, I don't know, how was I doing that, like this, yeah
892120	897000	I saw something shady, I don't know what it is, but I see it, close, close,
901080	907480	this is probably the hardest move, shuffle them for a surprise, I opened them wrong, can you

1554360	1567480	he's wrappedy, he's in put one black, he's found in the desert with one black,
1567480	1575400	a electrical generator, what was mr. mom doing, I don't know, threw back the tea,
1575400	1591400	Then we have a backpack. Oh my gosh, I'm so excited for the backpack. Get- get those legs out of here. You belong in the war. I don't care what they've done to your evolution line, get back in the war.
1591400	1597400	I didn't know Mr. Mime could wrestle with your mom. That's so cool.
1598400	1607400	Oh my god. Right, I take it back. Neubat's evolution is kind of fucking cool. Hold on a minute. Is that- is that Shani? Is that Shani Hollow?
1607400	1616400	Is that Neubat? That's not Neubat's original look. See, Neubat's purple. Oh my gosh.
1617400	1623400	Oh, is that normal? Is it not called Neubat?
1623400	1628400	It's called Neubat. Yeah, first one's called Neubat. Yeah, I'll show you Neubat.
1628400	1640400	Oh my gosh, I can't believe it. I pulled the fucking Shani. What? You mean there's a higher chance rate that every packet has something Shani in it?
1640400	1650400	No, don't tell me such things. I want to see Neubat turn it- it involves into Neubat.
1650400	1657400	What is the po-ka-dex of toy school and the- and the thingy? Hearing Ash cursing is so funny.
1657400	1666400	What the fuck are you talking about? What are you doing? Pikachu, for fuck's sake. Just kill the leader.
1666400	1678400	Why are you using Quick Attack? That's a normal type move. It's a fucking ghost type you're against. What are you playing at?
1678400	1687400	Basically, have I imagined how Ash would be? Si, I wish women were real. Takes a drag from a cigarette. I wish women were real.
1688400	1701400	I'm fake. I'm- remember, I'm doing this for Neal, okay? Ask her if I just snipped a card. I'm gonna cry. Did I? Did I just do that?
1701400	1707400	Hold on a minute, Ash. You're on the back burner, son. I'm raging. Did I just snipped a card?
1707400	1713400	Better not have. No, I've no- it's fine. I've no-
1713400	1722400	Ash, are you ready? Online players. There's that code and QR thing that you can do now. Yeah, you like that.
1722400	1733400	Did you go to pokemon.com slash bdm? Then you're not a real gamer. I like how the official lore is now. I've just done it now. There's no going back.
1734400	1744400	She is doing this because she got paid by the casino. I'm actually addicted to gambling. It's a real problem, but I hide it behind this board.
1747400	1753400	Oh, the results again. Magmar, playing the board. It's nice to have you.
1753400	1765400	Oh, are you the pre-evolution to that pastry looking dust? I can't- I know there's a generation that is in France. Is this French?
1765400	1773400	Is that French? Oh, not French. Are you French? Don't quit before you hit that jackpot. You already know it, baby.
1773400	1780400	Lantern. He's an evolution of the night. Clive. Congrats if your name's Clive.
1781400	1785400	Women's got- I'm reading this upside down, by the way. No, Jen's like this.
1785400	1788400	Where has it been?
1788400	1791400	What is it called?
1791400	1794400	Oh, maybe it's what it's called.
1798400	1800400	Cereluity.
1802400	1806400	I don't know what you are. You're a poison type?
1807400	1813400	The webcam ain't very good. You want it? Did we say it's good? Is it 16?
1813400	1819400	I didn't see that. I promise I didn't see that. Life's sucker. Oh, wow. It's like a fighting type.
1819400	1822400	I'm going to send the package.
1822400	1825400	Cereluity.
1827400	1829400	And then-
1832400	1834400	Are we happy?
1835400	1838400	I don't know. Are we happy?
1838400	1842400	I'll wait for your reaction. Special art? Good?
1842400	1847400	Good? Oh, hey! Hey! Must be streamer luck.
1847400	1850400	Streamer luck, streamer luck.
1850400	1853400	Streamer luck, streamer luck.
1856400	1859400	Oh, no! I made a cup of tea!
1859400	1861400	No!
1861400	1866400	No! It's fucking cold!
1866400	1872400	Whatcha say? I have no more milk, so I can't make another one.
1872400	1875400	Whatcha say?
1875400	1877400	No!
1877400	1880400	I'm going to try it.
1882400	1885400	No! Up for gore.
1886400	1891400	Okay, we're going to very gently put her away. So she's the Ash, 2.0.
1891400	1895400	So she just got a lighter voice than Ash. So if Ash is down here-
1895400	1900400	I need to try and raise it up here. Is this how she sounds?
1900400	1906400	I don't know. I haven't seen that anime, but you said she's kind of like a tomboy.
1906400	1910400	So, is that- She's a yandere? What's going on? What's going on?
1910400	1912400	What's going on?
1913400	1919400	Microwave the tea. Do not speak again for the next 10 seconds and think about the actions of your words.
1919400	1923400	Another one says microwave the tea! Are you mental?
1923400	1929400	Mmm, no. I thought I was kinky, but microwave and tea? Mmm, too far.
1929400	1933400	Okay, it's a game of three.
1933400	1936400	We've got three gambas. What's wrong with the microwave?
1936400	1941400	You didn't microwave tea, though. You can use the microwave as much as you want, but you want a cup of tea.
1941400	1943400	I'm not having that.
1944400	1948400	Your hit rate is- His box is really good. I've never seen that many hits before.
1948400	1950400	Streamer luck.
1952400	1954400	Another dodonzo.
1955400	1957400	This is dodonzo.
1959400	1962400	Okay, we have two more packs, and then we're going to alphabetize.
1962400	1965400	You have a tea addiction, a gamba addiction, a zeal.
1965400	1969400	They opened up that game that I played PCG Card Shop Simulator.
1969400	1975400	They've released it early, and I'm like, mmm, I want to play it now, but I must wait for stream.
1975400	1978400	I'm going to start fresh and then play through the game.
1978400	1981400	I'm going to hire you to work in my little card shop.
1981400	1983400	Oh!
1986400	1989400	Is this the card you're looking for?
1990400	1992400	Oh, it's not the card.
1992400	1995400	Oh, yeah? Check your force, then.
1995400	1997400	Exactly.
1999400	2001400	A warm-in oven.
2004400	2006400	I'm going to pour it in.
2009400	2011400	Tutu?
2011400	2014400	Lechonk, right here.
2015400	2017400	Sharked it.
2017400	2019400	Sharked it.
2019400	2021400	What are you, a picnic?
2021400	2024400	Oh, wait, it looks like it's got a coconut mask on.
2029400	2031400	Oh, you're new.
2031400	2035400	Ker-let-oh-bet-oh-piss, clobber-piss.
2035400	2039400	Glob-clobber-piss? Any clobber-piss fans?
2039400	2042400	Dom-fam, we know Dom-fam because that's an ashes team.
2042400	2044400	Hey, that's my Dom-fam.
2045400	2047400	Ne-mo-nans-backpack.
2047400	2049400	Well, I don't know why she's lost it, but get it out of here
2049400	2051400	because we've already got this card.
2051400	2053400	Get it out of here.
2053400	2054400	Okay.
2057400	2060400	Oh, it's the evolution of the guy.
2060400	2061400	Hello.
2061400	2063400	You look like you're on the same team.
2063400	2066400	They're the same player, right?
2066400	2069400	It's a ground-type octagon?
2071400	2073400	Huh?
2073400	2075400	A ground-type octopus?
2078400	2079400	Uh...
2079400	2081400	No, they're feyin'.
2081400	2083400	Oh, feyin'? Okay, okay, okay.
2083400	2084400	That makes much more sense.
2084400	2086400	Sorry, this is brand, so my brain's like...
2086400	2087400	brand.
2087400	2090400	If it's brand, then it's brand.
2090400	2092400	Ooh, what are you?
2092400	2094400	Beth?
2094400	2095400	Beth, what?
2095400	2098400	Please, camera, I'm begging.
2098400	2100400	Little?
2100400	2103400	Why can't you see the upper skirt?
2103400	2104400	Ah!
2104400	2106400	Oh, sorry, it's the next card.
2106400	2108400	Hold on, hold on, hold, hold, don't get too exu-
2108400	2110400	It's the next card, okay?
2110400	2111400	It's the next card.
2111400	2112400	Ah!
2112400	2113400	Ah!
2113400	2116400	Oh, my God, it's Meg Mortar!
2116400	2117400	Ah!
2117400	2119400	It's the super-evolution!
2119400	2121400	Ah!
2122400	2124400	Oh, yeah, baby.

2129400	2131400	Yeah, look at that.
2131400	2133400	Volcanic Heat.
2133400	2136400	Volcanic Heat is 170 attack, hold on.
2136400	2139400	During your next turn, this Pokemon can't attack.
2139400	2140400	Oh, it's a build-up.
2140400	2141400	It's like Sunbeam.
2141400	2143400	It's a build-up attack.
2143400	2148400	Meg Mortar is an ugly basketball, isn't it?
2148400	2150400	Why did they make his lips like that?
2150400	2153400	His lips were not that big in the pre-evolution.
2153400	2155400	I know that for the fact.
2155400	2157400	I've seen what you look like when you're wee.
2157400	2158400	I've seen you when you're wee.
2158400	2161400	You're gonna be like growing up with any like that ugly.
2161400	2162400	So what's going on?
2162400	2167400	Pokemon and making cute little Pokemon's fucking ugly.
2167400	2169400	Challenge impossible-evolution.
2169400	2171400	Sorry, that wasn't even a sentence.
2171400	2173400	Bye-bye, thank you for hanging in.
2173400	2175400	Please don't worry, you can't hang.
2175400	2176400	This is a short stream today.
2176400	2179400	It's not- it's not mega-
2179400	2182400	uh, massive and finished in just a minute.
2182400	2183400	Let's be honest.
2183400	2185400	Is this a serious Pokemon opening?
2185400	2186400	No, I've never done it before.
2186400	2190400	I just always wanted to do it with my childhood wish.
2190400	2194400	Okay, it's between purple or yellow.
2194400	2196400	Pikachu and then.
2196400	2199400	I mean, it's not that much damage these days.
2199400	2202400	I have a card that goes to Jesus.
2202400	2204400	You want purple?
2204400	2206400	Short stream, next four hours.
2206400	2207400	Let's go!
2207400	2209400	Oh, and it's slow though.
2209400	2213400	No, I dealt with the script writers.
2213400	2217400	So, I had to, like, get my management to send on.
2217400	2219400	There's two people I picked.
2219400	2222400	And I'm, like, right.
2222400	2224400	So there's been a message.
2224400	2226400	As far as I'm aware, there's been emails,
2226400	2228400	but only two people emailed,
2228400	2231400	and there was, like, seventy-eight people wanting to write scripts.
2231400	2232400	So, mm-hmm.
2232400	2233400	Right, was there purple?
2233400	2235400	Was there purple one?
2235400	2237400	So, I was up dealing with that,
2237400	2239400	so I've not had much to do, so I'll go apologize.
2239400	2240400	And then we were playing G-Mod.
2240400	2242400	Emperor Zurus couldn't fucking connect!
2242400	2244400	I was raging!
2244400	2247400	Um, I don't know why she couldn't connect to Sheevee.
2247400	2249400	Sheevee was hosting four, and I was, like,
2249400	2251400	oh, is it because you were hosting it, Stormy?
2251400	2252400	No.
2252400	2253400	No.
2253400	2255400	And we were, like, trying so hard,
2255400	2258400	but it just, it really could not get in.
2258400	2259400	Oh, no, I've done it.
2259400	2261400	Fuck, sorry.
2261400	2263400	I pulled it out wrong.
2263400	2265400	Oh, how?
2265400	2267400	I have one job.
2267400	2271400	I don't, I don't know what card it is.
2271400	2274400	I think it might be this one.
2274400	2276400	We're gonna do this.
2276400	2281400	If we get spoiled early, that's completely on me.
2281400	2282400	Yeah, we played offline.
2282400	2284400	It wasn't a stream, no.
2284400	2286400	And if we do end up streaming G-Mod,
2286400	2288400	unfortunately I can't stream it on my end
2288400	2290400	because the lag is too severe.
2290400	2293400	And I was, like, a magic trick.
2293400	2295400	Mm-hmm.
2296400	2298400	Mm-hmm.
2298400	2301400	No, I did not expect that much of a response on the list, right?
2301400	2303400	Um...
2303400	2305400	I don't know.
2305400	2306400	My friend was, like,
2306400	2309400	oh, you've got that many spoken words, right?
2309400	2311400	Oh!
2316400	2318400	We can...
2318400	2321400	Right, no one saw that, no one saw that.
2321400	2324400	No one saw that, right, no one saw that.
2324400	2327400	Ooh, right, she's focused.
2327400	2329400	Faincon?
2329400	2330400	Is that your name?
2330400	2331400	A faincon?
2331400	2333400	No one saw that, no, don't laugh.
2333400	2334400	Don't laugh.
2334400	2336400	Are you gonna focus me?
2336400	2337400	There you go.
2337400	2339400	Faincon.
2339400	2340400	Energy.
2340400	2341400	Good.
2341400	2343400	Fancy.
2343400	2344400	Good.
2344400	2345400	Lapras.
2345400	2347400	Good.
2347400	2350400	Moonlit hell, all right.
2350400	2353400	Can't unwrap the finished numeral's evolution one
2353400	2356400	unless you've got mega-evolutioned and
2356400	2358400	you saw nothing.
2358400	2360400	Pinnacle is gen 2.
2360400	2361400	What?
2361400	2363400	I haven't recognized him at all.
2363400	2366400	Good luck on the first thing to you,
2366400	2367400	Primi.
2367400	2369400	Love you, darling, love you, Primi.
2369400	2370400	Ecstasy?
2370400	2372400	Okay, we've got ecstasy flying through.
2372400	2374400	Pikachu.
2374400	2376400	Pikachu.
2376400	2377400	Oh!
2377400	2378400	Oh my god!
2378400	2379400	Oh!
2379400	2382400	Oh my god, I'm so surprised we got this card!
2382400	2384400	Oh no!
2386400	2387400	What?
2387400	2389400	This didn't get spoiled a minute ago because
2389400	2391400	I messed up the order?
2391400	2392400	What?
2392400	2393400	No, what are you talking about?
2393400	2395400	Oh my god, celebrate!
2395400	2396400	Yay!
2396400	2397400	Wow, I never...
2397400	2399400	No, I never expect that either.
2399400	2403400	Only I could have messed that up without them.
2403400	2405400	Okay, we got one of them.
2405400	2406400	Each one.
2406400	2407400	Wait, did we get another one of them?
2407400	2410400	Hold on, I need to go through the special tile.
2410400	2413400	These cards are special.
2413400	2416400	Also, I've got a bone to pick for some of you reeflings.
2416400	2417400	What's going on?
2417400	2419400	Mummy needs to have a talk.
2419400	2421400	What's going on?
2421400	2424400	I've been getting a few marshmallows saying
2424400	2427400	you feel really bad when you interact with me
2427400	2429400	and you overthink and you think you're upset
2429400	2431400	and you're annoying me.
2431400	2433400	What's going on?
2433400	2437400	Why are you overthinking interacting with me?
2437400	2439400	What is going on?
2439400	2442400	Why are you scared to interrupt?
2442400	2444400	Everyone's like, I've had a couple of marshmallows
2444400	2446400	that are apologizing for interacting with me
2446400	2448400	because they feel bad about it.
2448400	2450400	And I'm like, what are you talking about?
2450400	2453400	The person that did the 9-11 joke.
2453400	2456400	They're like, I'm so sorry I didn't meet up today.
2456400	2459400	And I was like, no, I was getting a rise out of the joke
2459400	2463400	because I said it so fast that I didn't think it.
2463400	2465400	It was funny.
2465400	2467400	And then I got another one that was like,
2467400	2469400	I feel like you appreciate me.
2469400	2472400	And I'm like, I'm sorry, this one.
2472400	2474400	I thought I was doing good.
2474400	2477400	I thought I was doing alright.
2477400	2479400	You know, I've been in every day, having fun,
2479400	2483400	looking through all the good things that come.
2483400	2487400	We don't want to embarrass ourselves.
2487400	2490400	It's a view of the reasons I have got it.
2490400	2492400	Some got it.
2492400	2495400	Open and put them on card packs.
2495400	2496400	Some got it.
2496400	2499400	Right, this is the last pack, so make it count.
2499400	2502400	Brains until brain worms got hands.
2502400	2505400	Yeah, and normally I thought I was defeating the brain worms
2505400	2507400	before they could spawn in.
2507400	2509400	That card is 9 gigabytes.
2509400	2511400	Oh, you grabbed it?
2511400	2513400	It's because you're super shy and you like it a lot.
2513400	2515400	Oh, this one.
2515400	2517400	You must brain break us not to think.
2517400	2519400	Oh, well, if you put it that way.
2519400	2521400	Oh, yeah.
2521400	2523400	Oh, yes.
2524400	2527400	You need your energy.
2527400	2528400	Shark a bit.
2528400	2531400	Right, for a fucking yambo?
2531400	2534400	How many cards are in this bag?
2534400	2535400	This is like...
2535400	2536400	Bruh, I've seen you.
2536400	2538400	Get over here.
2538400	2540400	Are you new here?
2541400	2543400	So many duplicates.
2543400	2544400	I know.
2544400	2546400	I know you're saying that I'm getting lucky with the pills,
2546400	2547400	but the duplicates...
2547400	2551400	Bruh, that's like the third or fourth time.
2551400	2553400	You don't have people who are like, I get addicted
2553400	2555400	and I just want to keep yamboing more.
2555400	2557400	I get so fucking annoyed that I spend money on this.
2557400	2559400	I'm like, mmm, you there or not?
2559400	2560400	You there?
2560400	2562400	Fucking shit that way.
2562400	2564400	How many backpacks does this bitch have?
2564400	2566400	I don't want to keep fucking buying more.
2566400	2568400	Chronic lurker hurt.
2568400	2569400	Here, can confirm I'm shy.
2569400	2572400	Oh, don't feel forced to talk if you don't want to talk.
2572400	2573400	So that's different.
2573400	2575400	You just want to lurk that time.
2576400	2578400	Artazone.
2579400	2582400	Ooh, Skipplin.
2582400	2584400	I don't know you, but it's nice to have you.
2584400	2585400	Is that mine?
2586400	2587400	Wait a minute.
2587400	2589400	Oh, you can have two and a thing.
2589400	2590400	Skipplin looks good.
2590400	2591400	What?
2591400	2593400	That was it.
2594400	2596400	Oh, he's shiny as well.
2597400	2599400	I'm fucking gambling again.
2599400	2600400	What the fuck was that?
2600400	2601400	That's fucking piss.
2602400	2604400	Right, I'm going to put the specials away
2604400	2606400	and then we're going to alphabetize.
2606400	2607400	We're going to number them.
2607400	2609400	It's shiny and a gender.
2609400	2610400	Skipplin is gender?
2610400	2611400	What?
2611400	2612400	Am I going to meant?
2612400	2614400	Right, I've not played the Gen 1 or 2 game.
2614400	2615400	I'm sorry.
2615400	2616400	I started at Ruby.
2616400	2619400	I started at Ruby and then I did 4 and 5
2619400	2622400	and then I couldn't do 6.
2623400	2624400	So I'm only similar.
2624400	2625400	You're wrestling.
2625400	2626400	That's me with the polka dots.
2630400	2631400	Horn good, yeah.
2631400	2632400	Horn region is my region.
2632400	2634400	The only reason, this sounds really bad,
2634400	2637400	but the only reason I remember horn region is my region
2637400	2639400	is because I'm horn me.
2639400	2641400	Like, I'm playing the horn me region.
2641400	2643400	That's what I remember.
2643400	2645400	These were our pools.
2647400	2650400	Let me just kind of zoom into it this way
2650400	2652400	because this is like...
2652400	2654400	This is harder than it looks.
2654400	2658400	Not that I'm saying any special applause for doing this, okay?
2658400	2662400	But this is not how I expected
2663400	2664400	to go.
2664400	2666400	I expected to...
2666400	2669400	I expected to hardly even know her.
2673400	2675400	My eyes, I'm sorry.
2675400	2677400	The noyvern is pretty cute.
2677400	2680400	I have to admit, noyvern is such a nice word to say,
2680400	2681400	like noyvern.
2681400	2685400	Like, it's a satisfying word to say noyvern.
2685400	2687400	Ah, noyvern.
2687400	2689400	Noyvern, noyvern.
2690400	2692400	I started at Gen 1.
2692400	2694400	So I got a special...
2694400	2697400	Wugtrio and Neymona.
2697400	2699400	A special art.
2699400	2701400	Rainworms go.
2701400	2702400	Mommy's love is here to stay.
2702400	2704400	Aw, thank you.
2704400	2707400	Hapsicum.gar for the extended membership.
2707400	2709400	Thank you.
2709400	2711400	I got a little...
2711400	2712400	We got guard of hour.
2712400	2714400	I'm really happy with guard of hour.
2714400	2716400	I think if I have to be biased,
2716400	2718400	noyvern and guard of hour
2718400	2720400	are my favorite tools.
2720400	2723400	Not... I'm not telling Sivirino.
2723400	2725400	Um, my fellow mercs.
2725400	2726400	I really like...
2726400	2727400	Noyvern has a lot of HP.
2727400	2729400	He's stacked out with HP.
2729400	2731400	260 as well.
2731400	2733400	It's just OP as well.
2733400	2735400	140, 140, 120 health.
2735400	2738400	Only 90 at that time.
2738400	2739400	No.
2739400	2741400	Are you squiddin' me right now?
2741400	2743400	You're so weak, you little baby.
2743400	2744400	Headbutt 30.
2744400	2745400	Undersea tunnel.
2745400	2747400	Flip three coins for each head.
2747400	2750400	Guard of top three cards of your point is dead.
2750400	2752400	Come here.
2752400	2753400	Black blood.
2753400	2755400	Thank you for the extended membership.
2755400	2756400	Sunnybell.
2756400	2757400	You can do more.
2757400	2759400	Two eggs is a full art shiny egg.
2759400	2760400	A full art trainer.
2760400	2761400	Two shinies in an art rare.
2761400	2763400	Pretty tall box.
2763400	2765400	There's so many Pokemon.
2765400	2767400	Play the TCG win.
2767400	2770400	Oh, I feel like I'm gonna make a fill on myself though.
2770400	2773400	I feel like I'm gonna make such a...
2773400	2775400	a guberino of myself.
2775400	2777400	Cause I don't know what we're gonna do.
2777400	2780400	I'll maybe need to research some videos.
2780400	2785400	I found a video game that I wanted to play for an ASMR.
2785400	2787400	Like pre-recorded ASMR.
2787400	2790400	Some people do that stuff when you do ASMR videos.
2790400	2792400	There's 1,025 Pokemon.
2792400	2794400	Okay, I recognize about 300.
2794400	2795400	Take your leave at...
2795400	2796400	Royce.
2796400	2800400	This is the bit where I don't really know how to progress.
2800400	2802400	And the reason for that...
2802400	2803400	Pre-recorded?
2803400	2806400	No, I pre-recorded ASMR stuff.
2806400	2809400	This is where I don't know how to progress, for the most part.
2809400	2812400	I want to numerically number them.
2812400	2816400	But I need to like place down...
2816400	2818400	like 1 to 10.
2818400	2820400	I don't even know how big this deck is.
2820400	2821400	Wait.
2821400	2824400	This deck is 91, not including the hidden.
2824400	2826400	Can you see that?
2826400	2827400	Oh, please do this.
2827400	2831400	It says this is card 39 out of 91,
2831400	2834400	not including the hidden.
2834400	2840400	So, I don't know if I should put them in the tiles for now.
2840400	2842400	Like that's the third tile.
2842400	2845400	This is 90, of course.
2845400	2846400	So what?
2846400	2847400	Like 1...
2847400	2849400	So let me back up a little bit.
2849400	2854400	So like 1, 2, 3, and then 9's down here.
2854400	2857400	This is 5, so that was over there.
2857400	2858400	50.
2858400	2859400	This is 71.
2859400	2862400	So like here in the 7, that's 6.
2862400	2863400	Do you know what I mean?
2863400	2865400	Is this the best way to do it?
2865400	2868400	And then I'll put it in the book at that way.
2868400	2870400	Back it up, yeah.
2870400	2875400	See, this is 4, so this would be at the start of the deck.
2875400	2882400	16, so that would be 0, 10, 4, 8, 8.
2882400	2883400	So yeah, there you go.
2883400	2888400	0, 10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
2888400	2892400	And then specials will go right where my head is.
2892400	2894400	Let me make myself smaller.
2894400	2897400	Oh, let me make myself smaller.
2897400	2899400	Aw.
2899400	2902400	You're massive.
2902400	2903400	You like my socks?
2903400	2904400	Is this the comfy?
2904400	2906400	Yeah, I got them at the asylum.
2906400	2907400	Man, they released me.
2907400	2908400	I don't know why.
2908400	2910400	They just had another name.
2910400	2911400	Fuck this.
2912400	2914400	50?
2914400	2916400	Oh my god, look at them.
2916400	2919400	Concert and things like that.
2919400	2921400	The Griffey Gryffindor.
2921400	2925400	Well, you never had heads on a V2 Gryffindor before?
2925400	2927400	What's going on here?
2927400	2929400	That's 14.
2929400	2931400	51.
2931400	2936400	This is the best way I can see it in my head to do it.
2936400	2939400	Like the most efficient way when I'm putting them away.
2939400	2941400	That says 8.
2941400	2946400	6, 7, 8, 9 specials increases when that's through the balls.
2946400	2948400	I hear cracking.
2948400	2949400	What?
2949400	2952400	Wait, cracking in my mind?
2952400	2954400	Would you be the first?
2954400	2957400	I'd like to be the first, but you're here.
2957400	2959400	I do like cherries.
2959400	2962400	Do you like cherries?
2962400	2965400	6, 7.
2965400	2967400	1, 2.
2967400	2969400	What's the first 2?
2969400	2974400	It's the routine you're doing to me.
2974400	2978400	Oh, Panko is the first card in the 6.
2978400	2980400	They always start with grass-papes.
2980400	2982400	You can do grass-papes that much.
2982400	2984400	Fancy for you.
2984400	2989400	3, 4.
2989400	2991400	The rest, thank you for coming.
2991400	2993400	Remember, please enjoy the emotes.
2993400	2995400	I'm getting new emotes soon, I promise.
2995400	2997400	I'm waiting for an update with the emotes.
2997400	2999400	They're not really doing much.
2999400	3001400	And I've been waiting so well.
3001400	3005400	It's not above 50%.
3005400	3011400	Yeah, the specials seem to be at the end of the deck.
3011400	3016400	No, they would be kind of the 4.
3016400	3021400	2, 3, and 4.
3021400	3023400	What's my cherry? Can you help me find it?
3023400	3026400	No, no, no. I've picked the cherry.
3026400	3028400	You'll never get it back.
3028400	3030400	Hmm.
3030400	3032400	I've got to work now. Good luck and have fun.
3032400	3033400	Thank you.
3033400	3035400	As I said, it's a very short stream today.
3035400	3038400	Please do not be getting straddled in.
3038400	3040400	I assure you the only straddling is me.
3040400	3042400	Straddling for a paddling.
3042400	3045400	I do think I'll have Ace more tomorrow.
3045400	3047400	There'll be a new Ace more video.
3047400	3050400	My Patreon is also going to get an update.
3050400	3055400	I can either do a police officer,
3055400	3057400	do something to your P-Sport,
3057400	3061400	or I can do a different role play.
3061400	3063400	Take care, leave it.
3063400	3066400	The cherry, mine, thank you.
3066400	3070400	No, that is...
3070400	3072400	Chinnicle.
3072400	3074400	I love Chinnicle.
3074400	3076400	Right now, I'm mercy a little bit for some reason.
3076400	3080400	I don't know why I'm just like that adorable nature.
3080400	3082400	Flip a coin.
3082400	3084400	Is what I mentioned was useful.
3084400	3086400	It's only the cherry trigger.
3086400	3087400	Honestly!
3087400	3089400	I'm not going to be extra haunted,
3089400	3091400	which I'm not mad about. I don't mind haunted.
3091400	3093400	Iona, you can pop off.
3093400	3096400	We've had enough of you for quite some time.
3096400	3098400	I have to admit, was there...
3098400	3101400	Iona, we see you quite a lot,
3101400	3105400	and we're not really that fast to see you that much.
3106400	3107400	It was nice.
3107400	3109400	Well, it lasted.
3109400	3113400	I mean, it was through 8-6-6.
3113400	3116400	Then we were given them two.
3116400	3118400	Sonya, I'm begging you.
3118400	3122400	You only got a few more hours if you're the 2D weekend.
3124400	3126400	It's only a few more hours.
3129400	3130400	I should...
3130400	3134400	I either have a hands-cam video where I'm tapping on the girls.
3134400	3136400	It's just a rambling ASMR.
3136400	3139400	You guys seem to enjoy my rambling ASMR,
3139400	3141400	and because I don't have to write a script,
3141400	3143400	it doesn't need to be performed a certain way.
3143400	3145400	I don't mind making it.
3145400	3147400	Like, I'm playing a happy music now.
3147400	3148400	Seriously.
3148400	3151400	So it's like a rambling tapping on each...
3151400	3153400	It's like with my nails, with my fake nails.
3153400	3155400	I've got five days.
3157400	3158400	I'm happy my music.
3158400	3160400	The projector!
3161400	3163400	Two days left in this season.
3164400	3166400	Your rambling is really soothing.
3166400	3167400	Yes!
3169400	3171400	I'm glad because...
3173400	3175400	Not in a lazy way.
3175400	3177400	It means I have less work to do.
3177400	3181400	A lot of pressure is taken off where it's like...
3181400	3183400	You don't need to write a script because you know me.
3183400	3184400	I'm already behind.
3184400	3186400	How much energy cards do they give you?
3186400	3187400	Look at these.
3187400	3188400	Energy, energy.
3188400	3191400	And then they already gave me...
3191400	3194400	Here is this entire pack full.
3194400	3195400	Remember it.
3195400	3197400	That's how much I hate it.
3197400	3199400	I've already lost it.
3200400	3201400	I've already lost it.
3201400	3202400	That's how much I hate it.
3202400	3203400	What?
3203400	3204400	I'm getting fluff on me.
3204400	3205400	Don't look.
3205400	3206400	There's fluff on me.
3209400	3212400	They really stuff me so it's tiny.
3215400	3216400	I wonder...
3216400	3217400	Oh, that's the seven?
3218400	3220400	That would still be it, right?
3220400	3221400	Yeah.
3221400	3222400	Get my tails of it.
3222400	3223400	What's the one here?
3223400	3224400	What's the one?
3224400	3226400	That's a team.
3227400	3230400	That's 51...
3230400	3231400	49.
3231400	3233400	That's 69 brain loss.
3234400	3236400	And then her backpacks which are...
3236400	3237400	Plenty.
3237400	3238400	Nope.
3238400	3240400	Yeah, we do not need any more backpacks.
3240400	3242400	I assure you we are...
3242400	3244400	Hitting down for backpacks, really.
3245400	3246400	No.
3246400	3247400	No seriously.
3247400	3248400	We do not need any more.
3248400	3249400	Is that it?
3250400	3252400	And then we've already sorted through all the cards?
3253400	3254400	Oh well.
3255400	3256400	We are efficient.
3256400	3259400	You can call us reeflings many things.
3259400	3262400	We are efficient when we know what we're locking in.
3262400	3263400	Mummy, have my first.
3263400	3265400	Oh, we got your super cherry.
3265400	3266400	Your super cherry.
3266400	3269400	Thank you, big ol' boy.
3269400	3272400	For the super cherry.
3272400	3273400	It's May now.
3273400	3274400	You can't get it back.
3274400	3275400	I'm fine now.
3275400	3279400	Mummy, yappin' is like the news for old people can't live without it.
3279400	3280400	I think it is.
3280400	3283400	Thanks for having that Susan rambling in the backpacks.
3283400	3284400	Hey mama, just got here.
3284400	3285400	You can hear that.
3285400	3289400	I'm ecstatic to record ASMR about having just quiet myself down.
3289400	3291400	I submitted a sample script.
3291400	3295400	Will I receive any feedback if I wasn't chosen or if I was?
3295400	3297400	When you whisper...
3297400	3300400	Like it's quite damaging to your voice.
3300400	3304400	Which I'm used to now.
3304400	3305400	I'm used to my voice.
3305400	3309400	When I do ash from pallet town, this genuinely hurts my voice.
3309400	3315400	But I understand that it's going to be okay and it will heal up.
3315400	3323400	But whispering pain of death not only takes the men to meet as well.
3323400	3325400	So there's a lot of 20s.
3325400	3326400	What's going on?
3326400	3327400	It's all 20s.
3327400	3332400	Again 21.
3332400	3333400	78.
3333400	3335400	This was a very...
3335400	3337400	So we got rare cards.
3337400	3341400	But I will admit the repeats are killer in this deck.
3341400	3342400	That's it.
3342400	3345400	That's us already ready to adjust into the good.
3345400	3346400	Brian got ignored.
3346400	3347400	Oh sorry.
3347400	3348400	Hold on.
3348400	3349400	Hold on.
3349400	3350400	I can't.
3350400	3351400	I don't have my headset on.
3351400	3352400	I'm reading.
3352400	3353400	Look, you can even get a little football.
3353400	3354400	Yeah, you like that football.
3354400	3355400	I'm a ballerina.
3356400	3357400	Shilin.
3357400	3358400	Hey mom, I just got here.
3358400	3359400	How's the script for everything going?
3359400	3360400	I'm a lot curious.
3360400	3362400	I'm a bit disheartened for the script.
3362400	3366400	But we'll ever see any feedback if I was chosen or not.
3366400	3367400	When will I know?
3367400	3369400	So two people have been emailed.
3369400	3375400	We're waiting on them to send their response script.
3375400	3377400	And then we'll take it from there.
3377400	3379400	Thank you Shilin for the morning.
3382400	3383400	Can I say that?
3383400	3384400	Yeah, I do.
3384400	3385400	No, they've been emailed.
3385400	3390400	So only two people were emailed and there was like 76 applicants or something like that.
3390400	3392400	So please don't be like, oh my God.
3392400	3393400	Shilin.
3393400	3396400	Like, oh, I got debated.
3396400	3398400	I thought it was an unopened part.
3398400	3400400	Oh my God, I got excited there.
3400400	3403400	Yeah, third time.
3403400	3404400	Sorry Brian.
3404400	3405400	Brian got yaps out.
3405400	3406400	I'm sorry.
3406400	3407400	I'm sorry.
3407400	3409400	Do you want me to repeat it?
3409400	3410400	I can repeat it.
3410400	3411400	Hi mom, how are you?
3411400	3412400	I'll repeat it.
3412400	3415400	But yeah, look at that leg.
3415400	3416400	Look at that.
3416400	3418400	You see me tensing it up?
3418400	3420400	Right there.
3420400	3421400	Brian, your turn.
3421400	3423400	Are you squiddin' me right now?
3423400	3426400	Hey mama, just got here.
3426400	3428400	How is the script writer thing going?
3428400	3430400	I'm a little curious but shy.
3430400	3432400	I submitted a sample script.
3432400	3436400	Will I receive any feedback if I wasn't chosen or if I was?
3436400	3438400	When will I know?
3439400	3442400	Brian finished?
3442400	3444400	Good boy, Brian.
3444400	3446400	Thank you for saying that again.
3446400	3449400	Oh yes, they've already been emailed.
3449400	3455400	I'm waiting on the responses from it.
3455400	3457400	I'm going to get a bit closer to you if that's okay.
3457400	3459400	Please don't freak out, okay?
3459400	3462400	I know I'm a real woman but it's okay.
3462400	3464400	I'm also like you.
3464400	3467400	So don't overthink your interactions together.
3467400	3470400	I'm born like you, okay?
3470400	3472400	I'm born like you.
3472400	3474400	Thank you, mommy, for blessing my eyes and ears.
3474400	3476400	How many submissions?
3476400	3478400	It was like 76 or something like that.
3478400	3479400	It was a lot.
3479400	3484400	Okay, so this is the only way I can see it being done.
3484400	3486400	So I've picked out.
3486400	3489400	These are all the cards that are one to ten, okay?
3489400	3491400	So we literally go like...
3491400	3493400	This is the first page.
3493400	3495400	Did I even have number one?
3495400	3496400	Number two.
3496400	3498400	So literally number one, right?
3498400	3500400	Fuck.
3500400	3502400	This is harder than I thought.
3502400	3504400	And these cards are in the way.
3504400	3505400	I can't believe it.
3505400	3507400	I never thought...
3507400	3509400	Wait, no, no, no.
3509400	3511400	Hello?
3511400	3514400	Are you there?
3514400	3515400	Okay, there we go.
3515400	3516400	It's double-sided.
3516400	3518400	I thought that.
3518400	3520400	Then it goes one.
3520400	3522400	And then we'll just take it from there.
3522400	3526400	This is the banger at the end of how full or empty it is.
3526400	3527400	Hmm.
3527400	3528400	That was funny.
3528400	3529400	I love your content.
3529400	3530400	I'm glad you can catch me live.
3530400	3531400	I'm so sorry.
3531400	3533400	This is like the worst stream to catch me live.
3533400	3536400	I'm just rambling.
3536400	3539400	I can't fit it in me.
3539400	3540400	Oh my God.
3540400	3541400	What?
3541400	3543400	That's so cool.
3543400	3546400	There's like a secret thing here.
3546400	3547400	Oh my God.
3547400	3548400	Hold on a minute.
3548400	3551400	I'm starting to understand why Pokemon cards collect.
3551400	3552400	A bit addictive.
3552400	3554400	Hold on a minute.
3554400	3556400	Oh no, that's satisfying.
3556400	3557400	Oh.
3557400	3560400	Oh, that's satisfying.
3560400	3561400	I'm sorry.
3561400	3562400	Hold on a minute.
3562400	3563400	Hold on.
3563400	3564400	Hold the phone.
3564400	3566400	What do I do with duplicates?
3566400	3568400	Well, I'll put them in a separate pile.
3568400	3570400	I'll put duplicates in a separate pile,
3570400	3573400	and I'll send it to Ariflin for the doughnuts on.
3573400	3574400	How about that?
3574400	3576400	You can have all my duplicates.
3576400	3577400	Nine.
3577400	3580400	So it's like one, two, three, four,
3580400	3583400	five, six, seven, eight, nine.
3583400	3586400	Like, that's how we do it, right?
3586400	3587400	Oh my God.
3587400	3590400	The dopamine all along was putting it in the binders.
3590400	3592400	It wasn't pulling the card.
3592400	3594400	It was, oh my God.
3594400	3595400	Tell me.
3595400	3596400	Oh, sorry.
3596400	3598400	That is so fucking satisfying.
3598400	3601400	I'm getting dopamine hits, like fucking turning the damn thing.
3601400	3603400	Now, as I said, there's a very high chance
3603400	3605400	of you seeing my face this stream.
3605400	3606400	Look.
3606400	3608400	It is what it is.
3608400	3610400	Put it back in.
3610400	3612400	It's still good.
3612400	3613400	No problem.
3613400	3614400	You just eat what you want to.
3614400	3615400	Right.
3615400	3617400	So then we're on the teens.
3617400	3618400	We've got 14 to 18.
3618400	3620400	We've got 11.
3620400	3622400	That's a good one.
3622400	3623400	Right.
3623400	3624400	We've got 11.
3624400	3627400	So nine, 10, 11.
3627400	3629400	Huh?
3629400	3631400	Oh my God.
3631400	3632400	That's so satisfying.
3632400	3633400	What the fuck?
3633400	3636400	I'm making a game right now that is just putting stuff in the binder.
3636400	3638400	And I put you in the two mills.
3638400	3641400	I am trying so hard to get you a good shot.
3641400	3642400	Oh, hold on.
3642400	3646400	If I can, like, put you in the two mills.
3646400	3652400	And then we get Nemo, which is evolutionist camera.
3652400	3654400	Because he can't erupt.
3654400	3656400	So there's lava on the back.
3656400	3658400	Oh, my God.
3658400	3660400	The binding of us at once.
3660400	3662400	Well, Pikachu is a wispy.
3662400	3664400	So put it in the wispy pile.
3664400	3665400	Sorry.
3665400	3667400	This is so hard.
3667400	3668400	Right.
3668400	3669400	You know what?
3669400	3670400	You know what?
3670400	3671400	Right.
3671400	3672400	Everyone calm down.
3672400	3675400	Let's move the fucking cars back in two by two.
3675400	3680400	I need a better camera angle, people.
3680400	3681400	Come on.
3681400	3682400	Think of the shot.
3682400	3683400	Think of the money shot.
3683400	3684400	Will you?
3684400	3685400	Jeez.
3685400	3686400	Any.
3686400	3687400	Keogreful.
3687400	3688400	Keogreful?
3688400	3689400	Keogreful?
3689400	3690400	Keogreful.
3690400	3692400	Okay, there.
3692400	3694400	Is that looking right up at my face?
3694400	3696400	I think it is a little bit.
3696400	3698400	That's it.
3698400	3701400	It is what it is.
3701400	3702400	Is that me?
3702400	3703400	In this one?
3703400	3704400	Is that me?
3704400	3705400	No.
3705400	3706400	What do you think?
3706400	3707400	I have no idea.
3707400	3708400	Right.
3708400	3709400	Okay.
3709400	3711400	I think I'm going to have to, like, swivele around.
3711400	3712400	Oh, no.
3712400	3714400	That's going to make it even worse.
3714400	3716400	The odds have increased of my face being shown.
3716400	3717400	Fuck.
3717400	3718400	Fuck.
3718400	3719400	Fuck.
3719400	3720400	Oh, well.
3720400	3721400	Yeah, well, wrap it up.
3721400	3722400	Right.
3722400	3723400	Okay.
3723400	3724400	Numeral is 12.
3724400	3725400	So, you got...
3725400	3726400	Oh, this is really hard to do.
3726400	3727400	I'm so sorry.
3727400	3728400	This is very unoptimized.
3728400	3729400	If numeral is 12, we have 14.
3729400	3730400	So, I guess we'll do 13.
3730400	3731400	12.
3731400	3732400	13.
3732400	3733400	14.
3733400	3734400	Wait.
3734400	3735400	Yes.
3735400	3736400	No.
3736400	3737400	Wait.
3737400	3738400	Hold on.
3738400	3739400	Hold on.
3739400	3740400	Hold on.
3740400	3741400	Hold on.
3741400	3742400	Hold on.
3742400	3743400	Hold on.
3743400	3744400	Hold on.
3744400	3745400	Hold on.
3745400	3746400	Hold on.
3746400	3747400	Hold on.
3747400	3748400	Hold on.
3748400	3750400	Hold on.
3750400	3751400	This is what I'm seeing.
3751400	3752400	This is what I'm struggling with.
3752400	3754400	I can't do numbers.
3754400	3755400	Well...
3755400	3757700	Yeah, and then next page, it would be 13.
3757700	3758700	Here.
3758700	3760700	And then 14 here.
3760700	3761700	Okay.
3761700	3762700	Sorry.
3762700	3763700	It's very slippery.
3763700	3764700	It's rather slippery.
3764700	3765700	I can't squeeze it.
3765700	3766700	How can I do it?
3766700	3768940	I mean, I want to be thebanger in the LA.
3768940	3769940	Wait.
3769940	3770940	Can I put you in between lines?
3770940	3771940	Is that easy?
3771940	3772620	I don't know if that's easier or more difficult.
3772620	3773620	Oh.
3773620	3776620	Well, if I squeeze it, it's actually a lot easier to do and go all the way through.
3776620	3782940	squeeze it it's actually a lot it's gonna hold okay so that is 14 and then
3782940	3792620	that's a repeat that's fine and then we've got 14 we don't have 15 but we have
3792620	3809620	16 17 14 15 16 and then we literally you get in the
3809620	3815820	second crushing fruit a bit early this is so hard
3828380	3838260	find out shortly that was 17 and these are duplicates and there's a 17 18 to
3838420	3843900	Pikachu so we're already on electric tape like what yeah like look how many
3843900	3861420	fucking gaps we have oh that's rough that is rough for a banger
3862260	3871540	need more gambas to sell the beans or I think that's how they're trying to get
3871540	3882340	you right this says so that's 18 right Pikachu is 18 and then we've got 21 18
3882340	3901340	19 20 21 have 22 whoa wait a minute my dumb not to have like a funny thing on
3901340	3906420	him like that hypnotist stuff well it has nothing on the car it's not to a
3906500	3934580	secret thingy put 52, 23, 24, 25,
3934580	3942580	Yeah, like all the sides. Yeah! Oh my god, what do you think? What do you guys think?
3942580	3952580	Okay, five, six, six, six, seven. That's fine. Oh, this is point two. Point one.
3953580	3959580	You get this. It's not shiny. It just looks slightly different.
3959580	3966580	Even with my naked eyes, it's in point 22, 22.
3966580	3971580	I'll show a big up close at the end as well, so please don't worry.
3971580	3979580	You're a Reefy in the city town. And in this 1819, 20, gorgeous stunning.
3979580	3982580	We're getting a bit more filled out. I love it.
3982580	3987580	Oh my gosh, this is speaking to me.
3987580	3991580	Right, that's pointy one. So we've got a Reefy. Oh! Yeah, look!
3991580	3995580	That one's different from that one, but this one's better.
3995580	4002580	So it's got the actual beef over it. That's going in the duplicate pile, and this one's from here.
4002580	4008580	So you think you could ever professionally compete one day with a dick?
4008580	4013580	I mean, I could compete whether or not I'd fucking win in the different questions,
4013580	4020580	but that's no harm in having a room tie dealer. Thank you for the three months extended membership.
4020580	4026580	No, there's absolutely no way. I could professionally fucking have a dick. Are you joking me?
4026580	4032580	I pick dicks. I pick my Pokemon based on do they look kawaii desune or not.
4032580	4037580	I'm not even going to hide the fact that I do. That's how I pick my dicks.
4037580	4043580	Are they cute? And you come. That's how I do it, okay?
4043580	4047580	Yeah, and she definitely is complete.
4047580	4052580	That's right. I picked them at their kawaii name. Right. What are you?
4052580	4057580	But I really cannot see that fucking number. Don't be afraid to make it bigger next time.
4057580	4062580	Twenty-eight. Twenty-nine. Thirty.
4062580	4065580	Do I have thirty?
4065580	4069580	I have thirty-one. Wait, let's get you in there.
4069580	4072580	Thirty-one. Gorgeous, stunning.
4072580	4078580	Oh, do you have thirty? Lovely. We love to see it. We love to...
4078580	4082580	We love to get in there. Thank you.
4082580	4088580	That was thirty. Thirty-one, thirty-two. We got thirty... thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-two.
4088580	4093580	Wait. Thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-two.
4093580	4098580	Sorry, I don't... I'm not very... You know, you know how it is, right?
4098580	4103580	You know, spondin'. I kind of spawned in as a girl.
4103580	4111580	I might not have the best kind of attribute, but as long as I try my best, right?
4111580	4117580	That's what counts, even if I am dumber than a bunch of rocks.
4117580	4121580	I'm just here for a good thing.
4121580	4124580	Thirty-three, and then that's thirty-five, which is correct.
4124580	4135580	And then I've got thirty-eight, thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight.
4135580	4138580	You've got a little pinch, just like you pinch the ball for.
4138580	4141580	And just do that with a little pinch, so there's nothing else that guys do.
4141580	4147580	And I was absolutely sponded when I saw a meme about it.
4147580	4154580	Alright, that was thirty-nine, so we're hitting them with a forty right off the bat.
4154580	4157580	No pun intended, you know.
4157580	4162580	And then forty-one, ooh, got a little clean slate going here.
4162580	4164580	Wait, what?
4164580	4171580	Apparently guys have to pinch and roll their sack in order to itch it, and I saw it in a meme.
4171580	4174580	And I was dumbfounded.
4174580	4176580	I forgive me.
4176580	4179580	I was not familiar with your game, gentlemen.
4179580	4181580	I was not familiar with your game.
4181580	4188580	Right, forty-one, forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, forty-five, forty-six.
4188580	4189580	Big gap.
4189580	4190580	Big gap.
4190580	4193580	I understand the gamble and the drive.
4193580	4198580	Oh, that's a good, good gap, and doesn't have to text on it that long.
4198580	4200580	Accurate.
4200580	4203580	Would you let me do it with my nails?
4203580	4206580	Come on, let me, let me pinch and roll for you.
4206580	4210580	Come on, let me do it with these nails.
4210580	4211580	Yes?
4211580	4213580	No, you scared of the nails?
4213580	4215580	Scared they're gonna hurt?
4215580	4218580	Someone sent me a marshmallow, they were like,
4218580	4222580	I'm starting, I don't mean to be asked such a personal question.
4222580	4228580	But I had to do it with those nails, and I'm like, well, see, I have the same post.
4228580	4230580	This is the peril, okay?
4230580	4232580	And this is the nails.
4232580	4236580	They have, they have not, the nails don't cut the peril.
4238580	4240580	It's not necessary.
4245580	4248580	Just, just so you shouldn't have, you know.
4248580	4249580	Oh, whoa.
4249580	4252580	Wait, no, I've not finished that deck yet.
4252580	4255580	We've got two duplicates, so that's okay.
4255580	4263580	And we've got Fampy and Dumfam, so that's 46, 47, 48, me, and 49.
4263580	4265580	And we're on the 50s.
4265580	4268580	And we're like, why is it so sad that I'm still not a vendor?
4268580	4271580	Like, I'm so happy right now.
4272580	4274580	Educational marshmallow?
4274580	4276580	Honestly, I don't mind educating.
4276580	4281580	I'd rather you ask me than never know at all, and like,
4281580	4284580	or be embarrassed to even try and learn.
4284580	4287580	Like, it's nice that you're even, like, curious enough to ask.
4287580	4289580	And it's like, well, listen to how it works.
4289580	4290580	Don't worry about it.
4290580	4293580	If you didn't know, because how are you supposed to know?
4293580	4295580	How are you supposed to know?
4295580	4296580	No, seriously, how are you supposed to know?
4296580	4298580	If you don't know better, how are you supposed to know?
4298580	4300580	That's a duplicate.
4302580	4306580	Haunter, these, actually, there's no difference between these.
4306580	4312580	So, I've got 57 and 56, and we've just done 52.
4312580	4323580	So, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57.
4323580	4328580	I'm afraid we didn't get ghastly, so we did not complete the game for everything,
4328580	4331580	which is a little unfortunate that we didn't really lose.
4331580	4333580	Thank you for watching over.
4333580	4335580	Some of us have much to learn.
4335580	4337580	Oh, is that a cherry, I say?
4339580	4340580	Are we up to date on marshmallows?
4340580	4342580	No, I've not looked at marshmallows.
4344580	4346580	You're gonna shit yourself, why?
4346580	4347580	I'm sure you're not.
4347580	4351580	57, 58, 59, 60.
4352580	4353580	Okay.
4354580	4359580	And then, as long as there's no scraggie, that's sort of, you know,
4359580	4361580	that's 60, sorry.
4362580	4364580	Sorry for some of my face there, no, I don't care that much.
4365580	4367580	Unfortunately, I do have a face.
4368580	4370580	60, 61, 62.
4376580	4377580	Hold on.
4379580	4384580	And then your duplicate, and then it was 61.
4386580	4387580	You're 62.
4387580	4388580	You're 61.
4389580	4393580	And you go, don't fight it, you're getting put away by me.
4393580	4395580	Okay, this one's the better version.
4395580	4397580	This is 64.
4397580	4400580	62, 63, 64.
4400580	4402580	It's very satisfying when you mean the bottom ones again.
4405580	4407580	Not seeing anything like this on, I guess.
4407580	4409580	Day one of the marshmallows.
4409580	4411580	It's trying to put, oof, steady on.
4411580	4413580	I think I've killed them enough for one, two.
4413580	4418580	40, 68.
4418580	4419580	What are you?
4419580	4426580	64, 65, 66, 57, 68.
4426580	4427580	Gorgeous.
4427580	4428580	Stunning.
4428580	4429580	68.
4429580	4430580	I must remember.
4430580	4431580	This is 69.
4431580	4432580	80.
4434580	4437580	60, 70.
4439580	4440580	71.
4441580	4444580	And we're just going to double check that math pencil,
4444580	4446580	because I'm not ready to do that.
4446580	4451580	60, 69, 70, 71.
4453580	4454580	And that's a duplicate.
4454580	4455580	Please stop playing.
4455580	4456580	Oh, please stop playing.
4456580	4459580	This is why you were getting thigh locked earlier.
4459580	4461580	That was 71.
4461580	4465580	So we've got 76, 79.
4467580	4469580	Okay, hold on, let's do the math.
4469580	4470580	Are you ready?
4470580	4471580	Are you ready?
4472580	4478580	71, 72, 73, 74, 75.
4478580	4481580	And then it goes 76 here.
4481580	4484580	God, that gap is very difficult.
4485580	4488580	And then it goes 77.
4488580	4491580	Oh, Jesus, we are getting there.
4491580	4494580	We are getting there.
4494580	4496580	Who said pick this one?
4497580	4502580	And then 78, 79, like that.
4504580	4506580	And then if we have...
4506580	4508580	Oh, I've mixed this.
4508580	4511580	I've mixed this last pattern.
4511580	4514580	Oh, well, we're not as...
4514580	4517580	Should have been me, not the binder.
4517580	4519580	Thank you for having us.
4519580	4522580	Please don't worry, today's a much shorter stream.
4522580	4524580	Literally, once I put this away, we're going to take a look,
4524580	4526580	and then I was so much in my loop.
4526580	4529580	And I believe she'd be streaming.
4529580	4531580	And you can read her out there into her for once,
4531580	4533580	because I always end up missing her.
4533580	4535580	I feel really bad.
4535580	4541580	80, 81, 82, 83.
4541580	4543580	Crying at that backpack.
4543580	4545580	There's no unique...
4545580	4547580	On that.
4547580	4548580	I'm just checking.
4548580	4550580	Oh, there's a unique one, this Iowa.
4550580	4552580	And the backpack, right, outcome.
4552580	4554580	No, I'm not having an outcome.
4554580	4555580	See that?
4555580	4560580	The backpack at least has the unique little markings on it.
4560580	4562580	Iona, for you too.
4563580	4565580	Who said get nails?
4565580	4567580	Fuck sake, I can't get nails.
4567580	4570580	Out and...
4573580	4575580	I think I put more clothes on my dad.
4575580	4577580	There's nothing else in here.
4577580	4579580	I think there was loads of knockoffs, like,
4579580	4581580	fastened day.
4581580	4586580	79, 80, 81.
4586580	4588580	So...
4588580	4591580	A little bit more filled out than originally.
4592580	4594580	I don't want to do that.
4594580	4596580	That's what she said.
4597580	4598580	Who are you?
4598580	4600580	83.
4600580	4602580	What?
4604580	4607580	Oh, that's a duplicate, Iona.
4607580	4608580	84.
4608580	4610580	I was like, that's not possible.
4610580	4612580	How can there be two of the same?
4612580	4617580	84, 85, 86.
4619580	4622580	Okay, and then the last card.
4622580	4623580	90.
4623580	4624580	What was that?
4624580	4626580	86.
4626580	4630580	87, 88, 89, 90.
4630580	4632580	I'm not off my board.
4633580	4636580	That's how empty your fucking desk is.
4637580	4641580	I'm not sure how it feels about that.
4641580	4643580	Is this how we get you in?
4644580	4646580	Is this how they suck you in?
4646580	4649580	It's not very filled out at all.
4649580	4651580	Dear.
4652580	4655580	We've got greens, a lot of grass pipes.
4655580	4658580	And then, yeah, gaps all over.
4658580	4660580	Oh dear, this is how they suck you in.
4661580	4664580	I've not put these guys in.
4664580	4666580	That put them in the binders?
4666580	4668580	Are they going to fit?
4670580	4673580	Like, that put these guys in the binder?
4673580	4675580	How do you do it?
4675580	4677580	Buy more colourful cardboards.
4678580	4680580	I don't know.
4680580	4682580	Look out of Rudigan's number.
4683580	4684580	What?
4685580	4688580	Oh my god, can you see that?
4689580	4693580	224, hidden out of a 91 deck.
4693580	4695580	Are you serious?
4697580	4700580	This is 224 in a hidden deck?
4702580	4703580	What?
4705580	4707580	This deck is 239 cards.
4707580	4710580	And I've got this many fucking duplicates.
4711580	4714580	Excuse me, there's 239 cards.
4715580	4719580	Excuse me, there's 229 cards in the deck.
4719580	4722580	And I get how many duplicates?
4722580	4725580	All duplicates, by the way.
4725580	4727580	All duplicates.
4731580	4733580	No way.
4733580	4735580	That's insane.
4737580	4741580	See, being told that doesn't make me want to go gambling.
4741580	4744580	That makes me want to quit, because like...
4744580	4749580	If that was my booster packs, and these are all duplicates,
4749580	4752580	how you need me, you know?
4757580	4760580	Literally, that's how they need to buy more?
4760580	4761580	No!
4761580	4763580	I'm sorry, but they've lost me.
4763580	4766580	They've completely lost me after that.
4766580	4768580	Are you serious?
4772580	4778580	Like, that's more than probably what was put in the fucking poker deck,
4778580	4781580	not to be my poker deck.
4781580	4783580	Like, your poker deck is bigger than mine.
4783580	4784580	I don't know what to say.
4784580	4786580	I'm feeling emasculated right now.
4786580	4789580	Clearly bigger than mine.
4789580	4790580	Oh, there we go.
4790580	4792580	I found the energies, as if that wasn't enough.
4792580	4795580	Here's a bunch of energies that no one asked for.
4795580	4796580	Just print the...
4796580	4797580	Fucking just print the cards.
4797580	4798580	Put them in the bag, bro.
4798580	4799580	Put the fries in the bag.
4799580	4801580	Just put the cards that I want.
4801580	4803580	Oh my gosh.
4803580	4804580	Very hard.
4804580	4807580	And so that's why some Pokemon cards go for like a hundred bucks,
4807580	4809580	because it's such a very cool tool.
4809580	4811580	Thanks for the compliment.
4811580	4813580	Oh my god, it's called a V-Tuber.
4813580	4815580	Sadly, I am real.
4815580	4817580	I'm breaking all the V-Tuber rules.
4817580	4820580	Before you get excited and click subscribe,
4820580	4822580	I do break a lot of V-Tuber rules, okay?
4825580	4826580	I'm not supposed to acknowledge that.
4826580	4827580	I'm piloting a mess.
4827580	4828580	Yeah, look at that.
4828580	4829580	Empty.
4829580	4830580	Empty.
4830580	4831580	I don't like that.
4832580	4833580	That's wrong.
4833580	4834580	I mean, don't get me wrong.
4834580	4836580	I had fun putting these cards away.
4836580	4837580	I was getting a bony.
4837580	4839580	Like, I was getting erect.
4839580	4841580	Putting that away, but...
4842580	4843580	We got...
4847580	4848580	I can't even...
4848580	4849580	Yeah, look at that one.
4849580	4850580	Holy shit.
4852580	4853580	One.
4853580	4855580	Out of eight on that page.
4855580	4856580	One.
4857580	4858580	Oh no, two.
4858580	4859580	Sorry.
4859580	4860580	Two out of eight.
4861580	4862580	V-Tuber rules.
4862580	4863580	There's rules.
4863580	4865580	I mean, there's unwritten V-Tuber rules.
4865580	4866580	Like, one of them is like,
4866580	4869580	don't acknowledge your pilot and a metha.
4869580	4872580	I used to get told off for that so much.
4872580	4874580	Don't acknowledge your...
4874580	4877580	using your emotes or whatever you're looking for.
4877580	4878580	Then...
4878580	4880580	I'll send you a chat.
4880580	4881580	Hello.
4881580	4883580	This is our polka debt.
4883580	4887580	I'm not really beating anyone with this, to be honest.
4887580	4891580	Can these fit inside the...
4891580	4893580	If these can fit, maybe...
4893580	4896580	can these fit whilst still in the packet?
4896580	4899580	You might look a bit better if I can do those.
4899580	4902580	I don't know if they can fit with staying in the packet.
4902580	4903580	Oh, please.
4903580	4904580	It's invisible.
4904580	4905580	Okay, it's invisible.
4905580	4906580	Oh, it can.
4906580	4907580	Okay, okay, okay.
4907580	4909580	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
4909580	4910580	Don't write me out yet.
4910580	4911580	Don't write me out yet.
4911580	4914580	Don't write me off just yet.
4914580	4918580	I've got 24 here.
4918580	4919580	10.
4919580	4920580	11.
4920580	4921580	12.
4921580	4922580	13.
4922580	4923580	14.
4923580	4924580	15.
4924580	4925580	16.
4925580	4926580	Wait.
4926580	4927580	18.
4927580	4928580	Executor?
4928580	4929580	Oh, there.
4929580	4930580	Executor?
4930580	4931580	Hardly.
4931580	4932580	I'm not sure.
4932580	4933580	I almost showed my face on screen.
4933580	4934580	Right.
4934580	4935580	Okay, okay, okay.
4935580	4936580	Hold on.
4936580	4937580	Let me put my specials in.
4937580	4938580	I didn't realise they could fit.
4938580	4939580	You know, it's a tight squeeze.
4939580	4940580	How was that specific?
4941580	4946580	Oh, it's struggling on the bottom one.
4946580	4947580	Is that in?
4947580	4949580	No, I'm just going to get schizophrenic now.
4949580	4950580	Oh, it's not in.
4951580	4954580	Hello, I'm thinking of do it again.
4954580	4955580	I'm so sorry.
4955580	4960580	Ooo, slide them in gently.
4960580	4961580	It is tight.
4961580	4962580	I'm not even kidding.
4962580	4963580	That is tight.
4963580	4964580	I'm gently...
4964580	4966580	I don't want to bend the card.
4966580	4968580	I'm really tight.
4968580	4969580	I'm really tight.
4969580	4972700	I don't want to bend the card or anything. I am gently.
4975020	4976460	Well, I've done it now, haven't I?
4978740	4979340	Okay.
4980940	4981940	Ooh.
4982860	4984060	Ooh.
4984900	4985980	That was tight.
4987980	4990420	147 special.
4991020	4993620	229 is Nemona.
4994980	4997300	Tentacruel, 213.
4997300	4999460	224.
4999900	5000980	69.
5000980	5003020	Nice. You have 69.
5003020	5004500	Just look for Neubat.
5006580	5007900	Where are you, Neubat?
5007900	5008860	69.
5008860	5010820	You look cute, Stanky Bean.
5011580	5014900	69. There you are. So this one will go up to y'all.
5017020	5018220	I'll give you a big...
5024220	5025900	Sound right, I've got 16.
5025900	5027980	Of course I would. Mummy, you're losing it.
5028060	5030140	It's just Corpheon.
5031260	5032060	Fucking...
5032060	5035740	Look how empty it is. I'm feeling a muscular lookie.
5039820	5042380	I'm trying to be like, all cute and stuff.
5043660	5045980	I love it. They're pretty rough.
5045980	5049340	Is anyone who have a Phil Pokemon collection here?
5050860	5052940	It's an expensive hobby, I feel.
5052940	5055020	This is 97.
5055020	5060620	90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97.
5062300	5065660	You're cool. I'm putting in orders if I'm going to finish this deck.
5065660	5068220	Stanky Bean, 23, I do not have that kind of money.
5068220	5069580	Nor would I want to spend it.
5069580	5070620	Like, I'd rather have like...
5071340	5072140	I wish...
5073500	5077660	There must be Pokemon Gambo, but with less filler, right?
5077660	5080220	Surely there's someone who's like, well, cut to the chase.
5080220	5082300	Yeah, it's a bit rare, but it's not that rare, you know?
5083180	5084460	Like, I want to cut to the chase.
5085980	5087580	A bit different, you know?
5088540	5090620	Why, something on your name, Jason?
5090620	5091820	Is that what the bill says?
5093820	5094460	That's strange.
5095660	5097740	What would stop you from doing what you want to do?
5103740	5108620	90, 90, 89, 88.
5108620	5109100	Stop it.
5111020	5111900	Look gently.
5112540	5113820	Tease teaser.
5115820	5116300	Mm-hmm.
5117900	5119260	This way, I might let you guys do it.
5121580	5123180	Right, gently.
5124380	5124860	Come on.
5125660	5127660	No, I haven't forgotten that I need to take bulls.
5128300	5130140	Before anyone's like, have you forgotten?
5130140	5131180	No, I have not forgotten.
5132300	5133180	40.
5133180	5134860	Okay, back here.
5134860	5136140	40, that's 50.
5137900	5139900	Is this 40 on the shoulder?
5139900	5140780	It is.
5140780	5143580	Oh, I have a spacey and a duplicate.
5143580	5149980	Right, I'll take out this one, and I'll give it to Ari Fling.
5149980	5151820	Ari Fling, huh, Ari Fling, huh.
5151820	5153500	Chicken fried chicken, Ari Fling, huh.
5153500	5155260	Ari Fling, huh, Ari Fling, huh.
5156220	5158300	Shawnee needs to take her team, I don't think.
5159340	5161580	I'm going to extend my way, can you get up?
5163820	5167740	Sorry, this blanket has too much fluff that comes off of it.
5168700	5170220	And then the blanket.
5170220	5171180	This is 70.
5171740	5173180	Still bizarre.
5173260	5176300	I've not had my book door.
5176300	5177180	I was there.
5177180	5179180	I even bought the webcam a bit too far.
5179180	5181900	Oh, I forgot my fucking mattress here.
5181900	5182220	Oops.
5183340	5184140	Ta-da.
5184140	5185660	That's how I say hi to you.
5185660	5186140	Hello.
5187100	5187900	Hello.
5187900	5188860	Hi, hi, hi.
5188860	5190620	Shawnee, hi, hi, hi, hi.
5190620	5191180	Hi, Shawnee.
5192700	5195660	So, I had to pick it up, or else it couldn't see my face.
5195660	5196700	But now you can see my face.
5196700	5198300	I didn't realize I forgot.
5199500	5202540	Okay, 69, 70.
5204140	5205020	Hmm.
5205020	5206380	Is that a leg?
5206380	5206940	I know.
5208140	5210220	I'm not in a wheelchair, popular to...
5212220	5215020	Contrary to popular AI artwork.
5221500	5222700	Oh, right.
5222700	5225660	And then are these numbers like the outrageous ones?
5225660	5227100	No, this is 87.
5228220	5230140	That's not outrageous.
5231100	5233580	88, 87.
5240060	5242220	And then now it's the ridiculous numbers?
5242220	5246220	147, 2, 2, 9, 2, 1, 3.
5246780	5248620	Do I even have that many slots?
5249500	5249900	Right.
5249900	5252380	You're gonna have to walk through the math, okay?
5252380	5253340	We're my boy up.
5254220	5255420	97.
5255420	5255900	Right.
5255900	5256460	Everyone.
5257340	5258460	Shhh.
5258460	5260860	I need shushes from across.
5260860	5261980	And this is gonna be terrible.
5263100	5266860	97, 98, 99, 100.
5267740	5283580	101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116.
5284540	5312940	117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135,
5312940	5316780	The following is a fact from UK-classified government documents.
5316780	5318700	Their accent isn't natural.
5318700	5323260	It's given a replenished by various brands of tea they drink daily.
5323260	5327500	If you drink tea daily, you'll develop one of the four accents.
5327500	5329100	Spread the word before they.
5329100	5334300	514, 6147, yay!
5334300	5335420	You missed one?
5335420	5336300	Did I actually?
5338460	5339340	Wait, did I miss?
5343900	5344700	Did I miss?
5346460	5347660	No, they're fucking with you?
5347660	5347980	Okay.
5349660	5352220	And that brain surgeon alloy you fucking with?
5354780	5356060	Stop fucking with me.
5356060	5356300	Right.
5356300	5357180	What did Brian say?
5357180	5357740	Hold on a minute.
5358380	5359740	Oh, excuse me for sawing my phone.
5364940	5366300	Brian's Edward Snowden.
5366300	5369820	The following is a fact from the UK-classified government documents.
5369900	5371180	The accent isn't natural.
5371180	5374220	It's given a replenished by various brands of tea they drink daily.
5374220	5378140	If you drink tea daily, you'll develop one of the four accents.
5378780	5380220	Spread the word before they.
5380220	5380620	Huh!
5381180	5383740	Yeah, that's right, British Edward Snowden.
5383740	5384780	Get done for.
5385820	5389500	You're either Northern Irish, you're Irish Scottish,
5389500	5392300	you're either Welsh, or you're either English.
5393660	5395660	England, school's not that good else.
5396300	5396620	Okay.
5396620	5400540	Thank you very much for the tip as well.
5402380	5403100	How could you forget?
5403660	5405180	Okay, 147.
5405180	5407500	Right, but it's not over yet.
5407500	5408540	Okay, we have two.
5409660	5411420	We have two 13 first.
5411420	5411740	Okay.
5412860	5414060	Are you ready?
5414060	5415180	I hope you like counting.
5416700	5417660	And it's not going down.
5418220	5418780	Sure you.
5418780	5426460	Right, 147, 148, 149, 150.
5427340	5435500	150, 152, 153, 154, 156, 178, 9, 6.
5436460	5436940	Hold on.
5437580	5448700	6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 8.
5449900	5454700	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 9.
5454700	5483580	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 200, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 210, 210, 210, 211, 212, 213.
5485660	5486220	Yeah.
5487420	5489420	Can 13 even be in this position?
5490540	5491980	I don't know if what we're doing.
5491980	5494540	I think I had, I did it.
5494540	5495820	I think that's correct.
5496380	5497980	Two 13.
5499500	5501020	And then thank the fucking maker.
5501020	5506780	These are for 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
5506780	5517180	21, 22, 23, 24, right.
5523020	5526620	And then last but certainly fucking least because I've had enough of you.
5527420	5532940	24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and then 29.
5532940	5535900	And we're done with put the deck away, no duplicates.
5537340	5541740	Oh, that was so fucking hard.
5541740	5547580	I wish, Tina, why is it so hard putting away Pokemon cards?
5549660	5551820	Can't we just count the pages and multiply by four?
5553500	5556380	There, my deck is done.
5556380	5557740	Now we can look at my deck.
5558300	5561420	You want to come over in my house and look at my deck?
5561420	5563580	Oh, no, like my actual Pokemon deck.
5563580	5564380	I just borrowed it.
5564380	5565420	So I'll put it behind you.
5571900	5572700	Right, are you ready?
5574060	5575820	I'm going to present to you.
5579580	5582780	There are many polka decks in the world, but this one's mine.
5584220	5584780	There you go.
5589260	5590540	Well, it's empty.
5590540	5591900	Yeah, I'm buying mine.
5592300	5605660	I'll show you if I was saying deck as fucking set, straight, we don't be pussyfooting around
5605660	5610460	these bushes trying to invite you to our house to show you her deck, but you heard it wrong.
5611260	5615100	Oh, no, you accepted coming over to see foot on me.
5615100	5616220	And then it never happened.
5616940	5621260	You're like, so when you pulling it out and I was like, oh, I don't know.
5621260	5622460	You're in a Pokemon like that.
5622460	5624700	I thought you're more of a Yu-Gi-Oh fan to be honest.
5625740	5626060	I'm sorry.
5626060	5627340	Well, I'm familiar with your game.
5629020	5630380	Oh, I love my wee haunted.
5630380	5633660	I wish I could have got my wee ghastly as well to finish their line.
5633660	5634220	But you know what?
5634220	5636540	We got Ralts's line, so I'll kind of do that now.
5639420	5640940	She's pulling her cock out.
5640940	5642620	Wait, she's pulling her cock out.
5643500	5656460	And then we get to the special part and for no particular, look how far away the next card is.
5656460	5657500	It's so covered.
5658540	5663980	It's so covered, it's so far away, literally all over here for the next one.
5665020	5670460	And then for the next one, the other two are only visible because they are in special little pockets.
5673100	5674940	Who fucking made these?
5675900	5678460	That is ridiculous, honestly.
5678460	5679580	That's ridiculous.
5681740	5682940	It's donkulous.
5682940	5686380	They are special, and then two more.
5686380	5686700	One.
5688540	5690940	And then last, but certainly not least.
5690940	5693420	Apparently she's a rare pearl, so maybe I shouldn't be so mad.
5696460	5698940	And the ultimate key is ridiculous.
5699900	5701420	Right, where's her?
5701420	5707100	I want to see my Ralts's line though, because I always play Ralts in the Pokemon movie.
5707100	5710860	I always have a guard there, I always hold her super safe, so there it is.
5710860	5712060	There it is, I'm coming.
5714780	5715500	Look at that.
5715500	5717020	My Ralts's line is complete.
5718300	5721340	Imagine raising a Pokemon to be used for breathing stuff.
5726540	5727260	Very nice.
5728220	5729580	Very, very nice.
5729580	5730140	I get it.
5732460	5734140	He's the martial in my deck.
5736940	5738700	Did somebody mention Vaporeon?
5738700	5742380	No, mommy wants to be Guard of Air, bro, Guard of Air is such a sex symbol.
5743900	5747100	I don't care what anyone says, I'm such a sex symbol.
5751740	5752780	My large face.
5752780	5754140	Where my pack's good.
5754940	5757100	I kind of got rip-fozled a little bit.
5758060	5759820	So these were my duplicates.
5761340	5763900	Like, that's pretty fucking stacked.
5763900	5768060	For duplicates, that is, that's rough.
5769820	5772220	A discount guard of our design for Gen 2?
5772940	5775260	No, we don't, sadly.
5780380	5783020	Yeah, that's duplicate, that's rough.
5783020	5784700	Like, you can see how thick that is.
5785740	5791820	Like, I don't know if you have a Pokemon card for scale, just to see how thick this stuff is.
5792860	5794220	How about Gen 3 Guard of Air?
5794220	5795260	Do you want us to guess it?
5799100	5801100	Dick torture, yeah.
5801100	5804220	Is it torture when I play this game?
5806220	5808060	Yeah, sick chunky boy.
5810140	5811980	End point, best, isn't it?
5811980	5813580	Just don't call it Guard of Air, bro.
5818220	5820300	I should do my Pokemon deck through this one.
5824220	5824540	Yeah.
5825500	5828300	So that's my agendination, I think.
5828300	5833260	The other stuff, just in case someone didn't clean all the coins, I'll show them again.
5835020	5836540	And then I'll read Marshmallow.
5836620	5852380	Okay, so put one, put two, three, ignore the, ignore the discarding system, okay?
5853580	5855820	Just in case someone didn't grab them.
5857500	5862540	Ignore the discard system, don't, don't, what are you, what are you focusing on?
5862540	5864540	Oh, what are you doing?
5864540	5871980	Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, identify yourself.
5873660	5875660	You're making a mess, oh no.
5877500	5880220	Should I not be making a mess right now?
5883180	5887260	So if you play the online game, you're more than welcome to clean all of those coins.
5887260	5888940	That is not a problem for you.
5889500	5891660	No problem at all.
5894860	5896140	Is there anything else?
5896860	5899420	A little player's guide, if you want to take a look at it, boom.
5900540	5901580	Oh, look at that.
5903260	5905260	I don't like when they do art like that.
5905260	5909500	I hate the fucking, how do you call it 3D?
5909500	5910220	I don't like that.
5911820	5915980	Pokemon are supposed to be, what?
5915980	5917660	It actually teaches you how to play.
5918620	5919980	I mean, it is a guide, right?
5919980	5921100	Colorful combos.
5922620	5924620	Cyborg for a mulling.
5925420	5930540	Espertha X is the angry, and it's Cyborg your opponent's Pokemon in the face.
5930540	5931020	What?
5939900	5943580	Build metal strategists, make it rain energy card when you Pokemon with
5944060	5951500	gold den or gold den goes, new lavish hospitality attack.
5951500	5956140	Pokemon like Metal X from Scarlet and Violet are amazing.
5956140	5958940	Obsidian Flames often have attacks that benefit.
5960780	5962140	Are these our specialty cards?
5963180	5964140	I've never had any.
5964860	5966300	Moonlight Hill has eyes.
5967100	5971420	Psychic decks get a new play through with Moonlight Hill, and there's no one better
5971420	5977900	to take advantage of the stadium cards than Garderbummer X, who debuted, oh my god,
5977900	5978860	Beach of Arreol?
5980300	5982140	Gen 3 Villar leaks?
5982700	5986060	Please tell me, you can read that says debuted, right?
5986060	5994380	Debuted in the Scarlet and Violet expansion, and now reappears in Scarlet and Violet halogen states.
5994380	6000460	Moonlight Hill, Moonlight Hill can help put basic psychic energy cards in your
6000460	6005020	discard file and heal damage incurred by psychic integrity.
6006220	6007740	Actually just confirmed?
6008300	6009980	We got both of those cards, I do.
6012860	6015100	Oh, just to rub it in your face?
6015660	6017980	Oh my god, just to rub it in your face?
6017980	6019660	They show you what you could have had.
6020300	6023820	I never even got Mimic, oh no, I did get Mimic C before, anyway.
6024860	6028460	I did get Mimic C, sorry, let me pop Mimic C in there.
6028460	6030940	Hold on, hold on, I forgot about Mimic C.
6030940	6034060	Mimic C was a special card, because look, we came in and we packed it.
6035020	6037340	Sorry, hold on, I forgot about Mimic C.
6037340	6040940	You know, you know the whole point of the box and the design?
6040940	6042700	Yeah, sorry, I forgot about that.
6042700	6045580	Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, I forgot about him.
6046540	6047820	And this is not holding him.
6047820	6048940	Deck appeared in the first place.
6054460	6056620	Doesn't wear glasses, has zero dents, perception.
6057340	6060620	I will go through what we could have had, okay?
6060620	6062620	I think it somehow had the perfect deck.
6068940	6070540	Oh, I love Mimic C, the safe card.
6071180	6076220	Prevent all damage done with Pokemon by the attacks from your opponents.
6079980	6081740	Who the fuck is Pokemon V?
6082860	6084300	I've never heard of Pokemon V.
6084300	6085900	Who's Mimic C?
6085980	6087180	Oh, he's right behind me.
6087740	6089660	It's perfectly behind me.
6089660	6091500	Right, 70, are you 70?
6092220	6094300	You're 75, right, go back to the book.
6095260	6097100	75, hold on, hold on, something's there.
6098700	6099340	What are you?
6100620	6103340	68, 69, okay.
6106220	6109100	70, two, three, four, five.
6110700	6113100	Here we go, little Mimic C's having a go.
6113900	6117500	There, now it's complete.
6121340	6123980	I'm 75, I'm Mimic C, 75.
6123980	6126140	Right, okay, let's rub it in.
6126140	6128540	Rub it in, let's rub it in, this is what we could have had.
6130140	6131100	Oh, Jesus.
6132460	6138220	Oh my God, they have shiny, these are the shiny variants as well.
6138220	6139740	Get to fuck, man.
6140620	6143900	There's no way you can organically buy a deck.
6144460	6146540	Like, via Gamba.
6148220	6149180	Via Gamba?
6150380	6151340	There's no way.
6152460	6155420	Hyper rear, shiny rear, shiny ultimate rear, above it.
6155420	6156940	This fucking post, yeah.
6158620	6161820	Uncommon, common standard of Ruth.
6164540	6166940	This is what, let's just pretend this is not Pokemon.
6170460	6176300	Oh, I can't imagine if we had that though.
6176300	6177820	Oh, and all the ghost tape.
6180540	6181580	Oh my God, what are you?
6182300	6183660	A whipper ghost tape?
6184220	6185100	Lord Shire?
6189420	6190140	Who's who?
6190140	6193180	Oh, the normal tapes, yeah, we had like one normal tape.
6194540	6195820	You look like Mimic C.
6196780	6200940	This is what we could have had, got any stars, can you say?
6200940	6203260	I'm sorry, I'm afraid to.
6205180	6208060	Oh wow, we could have had Abra on the hidden deck.
6208060	6208860	Fuck the hell.
6211580	6214140	These hidden decks are insane.
6214140	6215900	Holy shit, they have Padichur?
6217100	6218380	Lunatic Luxio?
6219100	6220620	Randomly just chilling out?
6220620	6221260	He's like, yeah.
6221260	6222940	Abra's in the deck as well?
6223660	6225180	What?
6225180	6227180	Who's who to forget about?
6227180	6230380	Like, who's actually feeling so shiny on the screen?
6231660	6235500	You're actually, you're expected to find out if he really, really likes Mudhip and
6235500	6238860	pray to him 50 Mudhips would all be true and rare.
6240620	6243420	Oh my God, that Mimic C.R. is so good on this one.
6243420	6245340	Holy shit, he's got a failed comma.
6250460	6252300	I love creepy little things, okay?
6253340	6256060	I love creepy little things, they're so fucking cute.
6258220	6259500	They're so cute.
6259500	6260620	Hawaii Disney.
6262620	6263420	Oh look, they're there.
6263420	6264460	I got the first one.
6268460	6269980	You got money to spend?
6269980	6273580	That's what I'm saying, who has this money to spend?
6273580	6274460	That's insane.
6275980	6278220	Oh no, that was the ultra rare?
6278220	6281260	There was the other variation of that trick?
6282140	6283820	Sorry, I don't see what you're talking about.
6285340	6286700	Do you think this is something different?
6287740	6289180	That looks like something different.
6290060	6291100	Muse in a bubble?
6291900	6292700	Yeah, well man.
6293340	6294460	Oh, that's the one we got.
6294460	6296300	Sorry, Nemona, this is the one we got.
6297900	6299580	Are we things creepy little things?
6300380	6302860	You are a wordable little thing, do you think?
6302860	6305260	God, there's a fucking God there especially.
6305260	6307180	But yeah, that goes for some fucking money, huh?
6308220	6310300	I don't know what these are, I don't think this is good.
6311340	6312140	God?
6312140	6313180	It looks like God.
6314540	6316780	Tengu, Wu, Qian.
6318060	6319340	Wait a minute, what?
6320540	6322700	Qian Yu, Qian Tao.
6323420	6324860	Wait, is Nihong good at?
6327100	6329100	I'm afraid I don't speak Chinese.
6329100	6331500	Are these being named after Chinese things?
6333260	6335900	Poraidon, Maradon.
6335900	6338300	It doesn't look like Pokemon, but it looks pretty open.
6339260	6340540	Oh hi, thanks for coming.
6342540	6344060	Ah, okay, okay, okay.
6344060	6346460	Okay, right, let me read some marching novels
6346460	6348300	and then we'll be directing the series.
6348300	6348940	So let's go on.
6355500	6356220	Okay, what do you...
6357020	6358380	Quick, eat a card, please.
6358380	6359180	Do not eat a card.
6359180	6360380	You can have a video, please.
6360380	6362300	So, okay, hold on, adjust your volume
6362300	6363900	because I'm not at the microphone.
6364860	6367260	And yeah, well man, what are you doing?
6367260	6369660	I'm adjusting the table.
6373660	6375100	Griffy salts, hey, yeah.
6376140	6378460	Hell yeah, apparently, Griffy salts are real mean
6378460	6379260	and I didn't know that.
6379260	6381020	I just really like to take a look at it.
6382700	6386540	Okay, let's see about redirecting into Shibu.
6387660	6389500	And before Shibu's not screaming, I'm gonna cry.
6390380	6391420	Please tell me she's screaming.
6391420	6392460	I miss her all the time.
6393100	6394620	Right, let me say cheeky redirect.
6395260	6395740	Oh yeah.
6396380	6397180	And then we'll read...
6403420	6404780	Is my headset...
6404780	6406060	Oh, is that me making my...
6406060	6407420	Hold on, I think I can hear myself.
6407420	6408140	Is that me?
6409820	6411340	I think there's something...
6411340	6412460	Is it in my headset?
6413660	6415020	It's a member stream.
6415020	6415820	Are you joking?
6415820	6418220	I can't fucking hit Shibu ever.
6419820	6420620	What do you say?
6422300	6425260	No way I can't redirect into Sheepster's.
6426700	6429580	I'm like, oh, I finally do a stream where I wrap it up.
6429580	6430700	She's not screaming.
6431660	6433500	Oh god, she's in a collab later.
6435980	6436460	Oh well.
6437660	6438220	Oh my god.
6438860	6440140	Sorry, I'm just so nervous.
6440140	6441980	Let me rub my little feet together.
6441980	6443500	I'm so nervous about you.
6445500	6446140	I got to go.
6446140	6447740	Shibu actively avoiding me.
6447740	6449100	Confirmed, yeah.
6453340	6454780	Oh, her weight rooms aren't up either,
6454860	6455900	so I couldn't redirect.
6459100	6460380	The other feet.
6461020	6462380	Right, let me...
6462380	6464220	Is there anyone we can redirect into?
6465980	6467180	Well, I'll read Marshmallows.
6467180	6469580	So it's actually, the Marshmallows are the most important things
6469580	6471100	for wanting to get your facts right.
6471100	6472220	I'm getting my facts right.
6472220	6473100	I'm also getting them wrong.
6473100	6473580	Fuck you.
6474860	6476780	And I'm allowed to get them wrong, okay?
6479900	6481660	I guess we're not redirecting into any...
6481660	6481980	Well...
6481980	6487420	So, unless Emmy has her weight room up,
6487420	6488540	we can redirect into Emmy.
6488540	6489740	Yes, I'm going to send you into a stream
6489740	6490460	that's two hours away.
6490460	6491500	No, I don't care if he...
6491500	6492700	Does Emmy have her rooms up?
6495100	6497660	I'm going to cast this particular torsion on the girls.
6499900	6501420	I can't redirect into anyone.
6502620	6504300	Right, Marshmallow time.
6504300	6506380	Strongly wish you more luck on your pools.
6506380	6507820	The next card stream?
6507820	6508940	I'm not gambling.
6509580	6510860	I'm not doing that again.
6511660	6514060	Mummy, your hospital socks are adorable.
6514060	6514940	Do you like them?
6516940	6517740	National Zoom.
6518460	6520380	Better tours away for Emmy than...
6520380	6521820	Their weight rooms aren't up,
6521820	6522940	so I can't redirect.
6523900	6525340	Wait, Emmy's streaming today?
6525340	6525900	Is it?
6525900	6527420	And I'm looking at the calendar.
6528060	6529900	It says, strongy, 4am,
6529900	6531740	she be 6am members.
6531740	6533980	Yes, I'm leaking fucking veiler secrets.
6533980	6536460	Then it says, she be chained together with Emmy
6537340	6541420	So Pralto and Vivian Bloss for part two with Emmy.
6541420	6542140	She be an Emmy.
6545020	6547420	As long as you don't cast Andrometriosis,
6547420	6549500	I think Griffie thought, would it feel good?
6549500	6551660	I mean, I could put coconut oil on them if you want.
6557820	6558380	Hi, Mummy.
6558380	6559820	I tried applying for the script writer section,
6559820	6560940	but I never got the prompt.
6560940	6563180	No, you didn't get the prompt unless you were accepted
6563180	6564140	into the next stage.
6564860	6566220	That's why there is no prompt.
6566700	6568300	You're just to give your portfolio
6568300	6572380	and give a quick about you or your interests or what not.
6573980	6575340	No, there was no prompt given.
6575340	6577420	The prompt's given to those who made it on
6577420	6579660	to test their resolve.
6579660	6580380	Anime style.
6580380	6581820	I need to test your resolve.
6582940	6584140	Oil on Griffie thought?
6584140	6585180	Because what will it become?
6586780	6589100	Mercy has one off in seven hours.
6589100	6590940	Her uneye-curved cure, are you okay?
6591580	6593340	Yes, I will redirect you into a stream
6593340	6594300	that's seven hours away.
6594300	6596060	No, I will not apologise either.
6597340	6598940	Do you like the way my toes can bend?
6600380	6601660	I'm always like ready to run.
6602380	6604460	I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.
6608460	6609260	No, wait, what?
6619660	6621260	Bend them around my tentacle.
6621260	6622620	Very straightforward.
6622700	6623340	Oh no.
6624300	6624940	Right.
6624940	6625740	Redirect.
6625740	6626300	Merchie.
6626300	6627580	And then I'll read the marshmallows
6627580	6628700	and we can chill for the rest.
6633020	6635340	If I may be a forward young leafling.
6636460	6638220	Maybe please get a pure unfiltered
6638220	6639740	brain rot earworm stream.
6639740	6642380	Oh, like where I just keep saying the stuff
6642380	6643500	that my brain says?
6644380	6646460	I'm not sure you're gonna want that.
6646460	6648540	I get very annoying very quickly.
6650060	6651580	Do you walk on your toes a lot?
6652620	6656700	I bend my feet like this part of my feet
6656700	6657260	at the toes.
6657260	6659980	I bend them a lot like all the time
6659980	6661100	my feet are bent.
6661100	6662940	They're either pressed up against something
6662940	6665180	or bent and sorry, I just realised
6665180	6666780	my hand was covering my face.
6669340	6672060	Sorry, let me recalibrate my tracking.
6672060	6672780	Real beautiful.
6673740	6674380	Hello.
6674380	6675500	Tell me much better.
6677500	6678460	Sony, can't annoy us.
6678460	6680060	I'll be the best stream.
6680060	6682220	Do you also walk upstairs on bent toes?
6682300	6688300	I used to walk upstairs on all fours
6688300	6689740	because it was so much faster.
6694060	6696540	I don't know if I've unlearned that yet.
6696540	6698540	I don't have stairs where I am.
6700940	6703580	But I think I still go upstairs on all fours.
6703580	6706460	Like if I was back at my family house.
6707660	6711180	I'm like 99% sure I still run upstairs on all fours.
6711420	6713340	Some decrepit dog.
6713340	6714220	Like I kid you not.
6716380	6718620	Like I'm chasing you out the stairs.
6718620	6720300	Like some fucking dog.
6720940	6723740	If I was chasing you out like nipping your ankles
6723740	6724540	on the way out.
6728140	6729260	I could see that.
6729260	6730220	I could see that.
6733580	6736220	I slowly talk about G-Mod in Pre-Chat
6736220	6737980	and I got hit by a wave of nostalgia.
6737980	6740060	Yeah, that was the first time I ever played G-Mod.
6740060	6741580	Glad to hear you've all enjoyed it with girls.
6741580	6743180	I'm a bit surprised to hear you can't stream the game
6743180	6743900	without lagging.
6745660	6749580	The lag was out of control with the ping and the delay.
6749580	6751580	Like I showed the girls how bad it was
6751580	6754140	and I was like standing in the corner for 20 seconds
6754140	6754940	waiting to move.
6754940	6755980	Like it just wasn't happening.
6760140	6761740	Shawnee chases you up the stairs
6761740	6763180	to put you to bed ASMR.
6763740	6765260	That would be terrifying.
6765260	6768620	Like oh I get scared of like the idea of being chased.
6769100	6772220	You know people are like oh I like pre-hunter type stuff.
6772220	6775500	I'm like I'm fucking absolutely fucking terrified.
6775500	6776300	Do not chase me.
6776300	6777820	I'll start screaming.
6777820	6779500	Okay you heard that scream yesterday
6779500	6780700	in the Subnautica stream.
6780700	6783180	Like I do not take chase and lately.
6784220	6786380	Is the members Overwatch VOD gone forever?
6787020	6788380	It can't come back on the channel
6788380	6789820	due to what happened in it.
6790460	6792140	I do have the full VOD.
6792140	6794700	I don't know what to do with it.
6794700	6796220	Well it was just too much.
6797100	6798380	Is the bottom line?
6798380	6800940	I mean I could maybe just put on blue sight later
6800940	6802140	once we actually use it.
6805420	6807020	The screaming is half the fun.
6808060	6810380	I hear that stream still in mind.
6811660	6813020	Did anyone stream Gmod?
6813020	6814780	No we were just playing together.
6818620	6820140	Shawnee is the monster that appears
6820140	6821260	when you turn the lights off.
6828780	6831020	Mummy I would interact more such as
6831020	6831820	in the stream snipes
6831820	6833100	what the reeflings are there for your
6833100	6835020	lovely voice if they heard mine
6835020	6837180	would all turn gay like the pinpals.
6837820	6842300	Oh is this reefling confident in their voice?
6844060	6845980	You need to come on the mic next time.
6845980	6846780	What's going on?
6849580	6852300	We've got a cocky reefling up in here.
6853100	6855740	We've got a non-R wordable reefling
6856540	6857740	confident in your what?
6857740	6860540	Get on the mic and the next stream snipe.
6860540	6862060	We want to hear it okay.
6863260	6866300	No pressure making those claims
6866300	6868460	around these parts partner okay.
6869820	6871020	Private reefling brother.
6871020	6872700	Shawnee calling your buff reefling.
6873660	6875100	So I'm sitting here watching stream
6875100	6876140	and pitching a tent.
6876140	6876460	What?
6877740	6879260	Oh the denial got me messed up.
6879260	6880780	I was going to say I was like to the feet.
6881900	6883900	I was like excuse me.
6883900	6885340	I mean if you like it that much
6885340	6886300	I can do a little dance for you.
6887420	6887900	Oh wait.
6887900	6888380	Can I do it?
6888380	6892460	How does Billie Jean is not my love?
6893180	6897180	She's just a girl who thinks I am my heart.
6898460	6899500	Oh shit.
6899500	6902940	But the kids are my shine.
6902940	6904780	What happened during the out stream
6904780	6906140	are you meaning to ask?
6906700	6907740	What happened?
6907740	6908460	What happened?
6912620	6914620	There were consequences if you lost on
6914620	6916620	Overwatch with me okay.
6917180	6918380	That's the best way I got.
6918380	6921660	That's the most brunt brute force way
6921660	6922300	that I can say it.
6922300	6923740	Thank you Broly legend for the tip.
6924300	6925900	That is the most brute force way I can say it.
6927500	6931340	If you lost your game then you lost the ability to
6933500	6935580	pre-stream dance was true Scottish dance.
6935580	6937180	No you're not.
6937180	6938780	You can't be a vodling yet.
6938780	6940620	Not until the stream is over.
6940620	6943260	Vodlings are illegal until the stream is over okay.
6945260	6947340	The consequences aren't real without the vod though.
6947340	6948940	I mean I still have it on my desktop.
6948940	6949260	Shit.
6949260	6950380	You want me to open up the file?
6952060	6952940	You want to hear it?
6957340	6957820	Here's me.
6959500	6960140	Oh my god.
6960140	6960780	Meal and stream.
6962540	6962940	There you go.
6962940	6963900	I got the full vod.
6965100	6967180	So I don't know what claims you're coming out with.
6968300	6968940	Nice try though.
6969580	6971020	It was initially 480s.
6971020	6972380	It was a mis-input.
6972380	6973180	Hi strongy.
6973180	6976460	Most people that buy the cards want duplicates
6976460	6977740	because they play the game
6977740	6979900	and you need multiple for making decks.
6982540	6987660	How they are but it is makes this fucking hell
6987660	6988860	can't read your English.
6988860	6991740	How they make but is right you.
6993660	6995260	I have problems reading English.
6995260	6996860	You had problems typing English.
6996860	6999420	So together the combination isn't working
6999420	7001420	but it's okay there's other parts of our body
7001420	7002780	that'll work together just fine.
7002780	7003340	I assure you.
7004300	7005980	The strongest cards on the rarest
7005980	7008940	making people spend more money,
7008940	7011340	spend more money to try and get the dupes they need.
7011340	7011580	Okay.
7012380	7012780	Yeah.
7012780	7013180	I tried.
7013820	7014540	We both tried.
7014540	7014860	Okay.
7014860	7015500	We both tried.
7015500	7016620	We're having a stroke together
7016620	7017740	but not like that.
7017740	7018380	Hey moment.
7018380	7019100	Random question.
7019100	7020940	But was Space Marine 2 a trending on Warhammer?
7021500	7023580	Have you thought of doing Warhammer 40k in general?
7023580	7025020	So I did fermentide.
7025020	7026940	I've seen some gameplay of Space Marine 2.
7027660	7029260	I'll need to watch other people play it more
7029260	7031340	but I think we will do it together
7031340	7033100	if it's a stream snipe game.
7033100	7035020	If Space Marine I can get you in stream snipe.
7035020	7037340	I would like to play it with you for the first time.
7037340	7038220	I think it would be nice.
7039100	7041100	Um yeah.
7041100	7042700	This is now a feet stream.
7042700	7044540	You want me to talk with my feet?
7044540	7048140	So I think we can play Space Marine 2 together
7048140	7050620	but it has to be a stream snipe.
7051260	7052780	Will fermentide come back?
7053340	7055260	I think so but much later on.
7056860	7058620	Every syllable I hit my feet okay.
7059340	7059980	Hello.
7059980	7061340	Any good cards today?
7061340	7062780	Uh so yeah let me show you.
7062780	7063660	Hold on.
7063660	7064220	Hold on.
7064220	7064620	Wait.
7067580	7068860	Uh we got...
7070460	7070860	Hold on.
7070860	7072540	I'll see if I can show you the real ones real quick.
7072540	7073740	I know I'm further away from the mic.
7073740	7074300	Forgive me.
7075980	7078780	Uh kind of had a little shiny guy there.
7078780	7080620	We got guard devour shiny.
7080620	7081180	Are you ready?
7081900	7083180	The most important card.
7083180	7086700	The Bokuwara SEX.
7087020	7089020	SEX.
7089020	7091020	SEX.
7091020	7093020	SEX.
7093020	7093820	SEX.
7093820	7097100	Unfortunately very empty deck but we got Noibat.
7097100	7098300	Uh Noivern.
7098300	7099260	Noibat lane.
7099260	7100380	Very happy with that so.
7101100	7103500	Um it's not the best.
7103500	7107500	We did get a very spanking rare like all the way back here.
7107500	7108060	Where is it?
7108620	7112380	We got a rare thing that's supposed to be a tentacrow
7112380	7113020	but they changed that.
7113020	7114220	I don't know what they did.
7114220	7115660	Bokuwara SEX.
7115660	7117420	And we got a rare pool on him.
7117420	7118860	A little wiggly worm boy.
7118860	7121260	And then our last pool was Neruso.
7123100	7124140	Oh no of course not.
7124140	7125580	Neruso's his youtuber that I watched.
7127580	7129820	Her name is Nemono.
7130460	7131340	Not Neruso.
7138700	7139020	Um.
7139980	7146060	Hello mom I just wanted to say that you're doing a good job.
7146060	7147180	You stop that.
7147180	7148460	I'm not giving brain worms.
7148460	7149180	Thank you.
7149180	7149740	I try.
7150460	7151340	Don't worry about it.
7151340	7154140	Some will just get brain worms and it's inevitable bubble.
7154140	7155820	But you're still doing a very good job.
7156540	7157500	Keeping them at bay.
7157500	7160060	Also interacting with you is not always good.
7160060	7162060	Imagine getting 48 days of no income.
7162060	7163580	No I didn't understand that.
7163580	7164700	It was a misinput.
7166220	7167420	A jail bird spot.
7167420	7168300	I just like Neruso.
7168300	7169740	I like her big fat titties.
7169740	7170860	Deep cups with X.
7170860	7172620	Oh wait she doesn't want us to say that anymore.
7173340	7173580	Oh.
7174380	7175580	I never said that.
7175580	7177420	Strony is short for stronethin.
7178300	7181260	Sadly I'm not smart enough to do something clever with cuttles.
7181260	7183260	So it doesn't beat Jimmy B soup.
7184700	7186380	I'm called stronethin.
7186380	7187660	Is that my legal name?
7187660	7187980	Fuck.
7188540	7189740	Stronethin?
7189740	7190060	Shit.
7191180	7192780	Can we take the socks off?
7193980	7194780	Reeflin!
7196460	7196780	No.
7197420	7198220	That comes late.
7199180	7200540	But I'll still talk through my feet though.
7201740	7202380	Hi strony.
7202380	7205020	I still have time on my no ink in your legs and thighs.
7205020	7206540	You're making it hard to get right.
7207660	7209100	Oh I just need stretch.
7209100	7210380	Oh look at the shape of that.
7210380	7211660	Look at the calf muscle shape.
7211660	7212780	Can you tell I ride a bike?
7213660	7215260	Can you tell I got some stamina?
7215260	7216300	What did Neruso say?
7216300	7217580	I could have sworn Neruso was like
7217580	7219100	I've had enough of yous being like I have big...
7220700	7222220	Can you tell I ride a bike yes or no?
7222220	7222860	Be honest.
7223660	7224380	Can you tell?
7225020	7227020	Do I ride a bike yes or no?
7227980	7228480	No.
7231580	7233340	Pray please it's my birthday?
7233340	7233820	No.
7235180	7237180	I hope that bike isn't the only thing you ride.
7237740	7239660	Well I did say I'm re-sexual so...
7241820	7243340	And...
7244460	7246780	How long does it take for you to train your back door?
7252140	7253340	That's for another stream.
7257500	7258140	Okay.
7258140	7260060	Did we all enjoy the wholesome Pokemon time?
7260060	7261420	Sorry I just dropped the ball over here.
7262140	7264860	The idle foot cam is killing me with my boot bit.
7264860	7265820	Your foot interests.
7265820	7266540	They are so cute.
7266540	7267180	Please let me...
7267980	7269100	You like my feet?
7271180	7273260	Would you like them even more if they were oiled up?
7277580	7279500	Is there anyone here that's into CBT?
7279500	7280460	Be honest.
7280460	7282780	I too enjoy cognitive behavioral therapy.
7282780	7285180	It is great for helping your health and overall thoughts.
7288380	7289820	I wish I had something square...
7289820	7290540	I did!
7291900	7292620	Oh my god.
7293820	7296700	I was like, I wish I had something especially I could stand on.
7302300	7302620	There.
7304300	7305500	Can I slip on this?
7305500	7307820	Holy crap this is like so slippery.
7310860	7312780	There stop it you're being denied.
7315020	7317260	Have you seen that video where she's like doing this?
7317820	7318940	To the guys?
7318940	7320140	For no particular reason.
7320140	7321500	Oh, playing a bit fit.
7321500	7322380	Bit fit.
7322380	7323500	Oh yeah the Celtics on!
7323500	7324140	Celtics on!
7324140	7324780	Everyone shut up!
7324780	7325420	Celtics playing!
7326140	7327340	Oh, oh, oh, oh!
7329340	7335260	Don't know if it's possible but putting the missing OW2 stream on Bansley would be a good solution.
7335260	7335500	Probably.
7335500	7340220	Seeing what happened in the stream I think the reeflings who missed it would greatly appreciate it.
7340220	7341260	Yes, I can do that.
7342780	7344380	Just not yet because I'm not ready for it yet.
7344380	7345420	Oh, oh, Celtics on!
7345420	7345980	Celtics on!
7345980	7346460	She shoots!
7346460	7347740	Oh, she scores!
7347740	7348540	Let's go.
7348540	7349020	Let's go.
7349660	7350140	I lost.
7351340	7353260	Unfortunately I know where she's talking about!
7353260	7353820	I win!
7354940	7355740	Don't slip.
7355740	7357340	Oh, don't slip the slide.
7357340	7357980	Can't read it.
7359020	7360700	Oh, so this is the Pokemon stream.
7360700	7363900	Let's just put some cards in the viewpoint at least, you know.
7363900	7364300	There.
7364300	7365820	Now it's a real Pokemon stream.
7367100	7367980	Hi cuddles!
7367980	7370540	I'm much bigger and stronger than you but the thought of you dominant.
7370540	7372140	Oh, can I read these?
7373500	7374620	I don't think I can read these.
7377340	7377820	Ahem.
7384860	7385660	Do you want to float?
7388860	7389420	Love it.
7389420	7390300	Love it too, though.
7391420	7394460	What about the one with the guy in the floorboard?
7394460	7395500	Yeah, that was the one.
7396140	7398780	I was at Azura put it in the discord?
7399340	7401980	Like Azura randomly put it in the discord.
7402380	7406780	And she thought it was fake.
7406780	7408300	And it was like, no Azura.
7408300	7410860	This is real cognitive behavioral therapy.
7411660	7413900	And all of us were like, what is this?
7413900	7416140	And we all watched it and it was the guy like, oh!
7418620	7421740	And it was like, Azura, what do you mean you thought it was fake?
7421740	7423340	You can see it getting redder.
7424460	7426220	That was very much not fake, no.
7426860	7428060	Yeah, yeah.
7428140	7432460	It's thank you Nihongo or Nides for the tip.
7436060	7440060	But yes, the diamond diamond.
7440060	7442060	Some Pokemon card opened and this was off.
7445500	7446700	Are you enjoying the card?
7449020	7449580	Hopefully.
7451260	7452540	What's the gen donation?
7452540	7454780	Oh, I'm annoying you with Shibi tomorrow.
7454780	7456780	Yeah, me and Shibi are going to be a drill.
7456780	7460780	She's never played the portal to Azura into it.
7460780	7463660	I don't, I think she just didn't think it was real.
7463660	7464460	And she was like, oh.
7467260	7468940	I have seen it smashed between two boards.
7470220	7472300	Most horrific one I thought was a lady in heels
7472300	7474620	where she actually gives them a pure, oh fuck that man.
7475180	7479100	I think the worst thing I ever saw was like a flattening device.
7479100	7483580	But it was flattened to like, I'm not even like an eighth of an inch.
7483580	7485020	It was flattened.
7485900	7487420	Like, I wasn't saying.
7488940	7490940	A feet cam featuring some Pokemon cards.
7490940	7491580	Oh yeah, sorry.
7491580	7493340	I'm to talk via my feet.
7493340	7494220	Hello, Reefling.
7499020	7500140	Flattening device?
7500140	7501580	Yeah, please stop.
7501580	7504220	Well, I'm helping you if you're in the denial.
7504220	7506060	I'm actually throwing you a bone.
7508540	7512940	A CBT is also your special interest?
7512940	7514140	No!
7514140	7515900	Oh dear, poor Reefling.
7517100	7518060	Hi, Strony.
7518060	7520380	This has been the longest 48 hours of my life.
7520380	7520700	Well.
7524220	7525340	Flattening device?
7525340	7526540	More like Strony's cake.
7526540	7527500	Oh yeah, you wanna see that too?
7528220	7529180	Kidding!
7529180	7529900	You saw.
7529900	7530460	You saw.
7532060	7533820	This is bad as the time as Narissa mentioned
7533820	7535580	giving a guy a paper cut and taking his...
7536540	7538380	What story did she tell us?
7539580	7540940	Your hands are funny looking.
7540940	7542300	I know they're claws.
7543180	7544220	I got fake nails on.
7545660	7546220	Let me see them.
7547340	7548700	Little fake nails.
7548700	7549900	Where the fuck is the webcam?
7549900	7550780	Easy, I can't find them.
7551660	7553500	Yeah, what an interesting design.
7553500	7556220	Middle finger and thumb only on the purple?
7556220	7558140	This is supposed to be purple.
7558140	7560060	It looked purple in the shop.
7560060	7561580	And then I walked outside and it's blue
7561580	7562300	and I'm like, I assure you,
7562300	7564140	we do not have a fucking Celtic and Rangers
7564140	7565260	bloody YouTuber model.
7566140	7567740	Look, me getting a bit political
7567740	7569420	around these parts, aren't we?
7570220	7570780	What, me?
7571500	7573020	Close beta testing.
7573020	7573420	Yes.
7574700	7576860	The Card Shop Simulator game
7576860	7577980	released full version,
7577980	7579020	which I really wanna play.
7582940	7585420	Sorry, I'm getting a lot of good feedback on my legs
7585420	7587660	when I'm stretching and things like this.
7587660	7589340	This feels really nice.
7589340	7591580	As I said, I always have my toes
7592380	7593740	pushed in against something.
7595500	7597980	If you can't handle strontia or stumpies,
7597980	7600300	you don't deserve her at her suppies.
7601740	7603180	Is your kitty around?
7603180	7604380	I don't think so.
7604380	7605500	Hold on, I can go ask.
7606780	7608220	I'll go ask Camely.
7609580	7612140	Camely, are you there, Camely?
7613900	7616140	Camely, where'd you go?
7620700	7621500	Are you coming?
7623500	7624860	I don't know if you can see her.
7625740	7626140	Come.
7626940	7627340	Come on.
7627340	7628380	I heard there's a...
7629580	7630380	Come on.
7630380	7632300	Vigo doesn't like this one,
7632300	7633980	so I'm not gonna even ask him.
7633980	7634940	Get away.
7636380	7637900	Come explore the Pokémon.
7639500	7641180	Where are you going, Vigo?
7642700	7643180	She's...
7643180	7645660	She's no longer in this race.
7645660	7647180	She's a spirit.
7647180	7648140	She's a spirit.
7648140	7649100	She's a spirit.
7649100	7650060	She's a spirit.
7650060	7651020	She's a spirit.
7651020	7651900	She's a spirit.
7651900	7652940	She's a spirit.
7652940	7653740	She's a spirit.
7653740	7654460	She's a spirit.
7654460	7655340	She's a spirit.
7655980	7657420	I just need her to jump there.
7657420	7658460	She's a spirit.
7659660	7660540	I'm scared here.
7661340	7663180	Because normally I'm super quiet,
7663180	7664780	and then I get all nice and loud with you.
7665660	7666380	Who do you mean?
7667420	7668700	Camely's gonna chew on the corn.
7672460	7673260	Give him my things.
7673260	7674140	She didn't hate me.
7674140	7674540	She just...
7675260	7676540	Because I'm very quiet.
7677420	7681660	Like, I spoke on G mode with the girls this morning,
7682380	7685820	and Vigo was meowing his head off
7685820	7687260	as I was like, Vigo, Vigo, Vigo.
7690700	7692220	A peacock girl.
7692220	7692860	Interesting.
7692860	7694140	No, this is not peacock.
7694140	7695980	You can't guess from the colour scheme.
7695980	7697740	It's supposed to be purple and green.
7699580	7701180	You cannot guess what this type of girl
7701180	7702380	would be from the nails alone.
7703660	7704780	It is not possible,
7704780	7705900	but no, she's not peacock.
7705900	7706780	It is purple.
7706780	7707900	It's supposed to be purple,
7707900	7709180	but that's very blue on screen.
7709900	7711100	Hospital socks again?
7711100	7713020	When am I never out of them?
7714300	7714780	Hmm?
7714780	7716380	Have you ever seen me out of hospital socks?
7716380	7717980	I'm actually in the hospital right now,
7717980	7719580	and they just let me do what I please.
7720380	7725020	I give them no grief when I get to hang out with the refunds,
7725020	7726380	and I get to do what I want.
7726380	7727340	I get no grief,
7727340	7729420	so they let me have a little pee pee
7729420	7730620	in my little stream once.
7731500	7732380	Feet nails?
7732380	7733100	Nails.
7733100	7733420	Hmm.
7736940	7737820	There's a pee in.
7737820	7738780	There's a pee in.
7739580	7740540	Oh, there.
7740540	7742300	Mummy's in the hospital?
7742300	7743260	Yeah.
7743260	7744860	All right, I got to go get some dinner.
7744860	7745580	Rest well.
7745580	7746620	Thank you for hanging.
7747500	7750380	And I...
7750380	7752140	I'm actually going to redirect into emergency.
7752140	7753820	This is a much shorter stream today.
7753820	7754780	Down badling?
7754780	7755660	You can say.
7755660	7756620	Noodle arms.
7756620	7757100	Uh-huh.
7757100	7758460	Humongous cake.
7758460	7758780	Yes.
7758780	7762220	And some nice-looking athletic legs.
7762860	7763020	Uh-huh.
7763020	7764060	So looking good.
7764060	7765260	Oh, you want to taste?
7766220	7768300	You want to taste of this cuttlefish?
7768300	7770060	You like calamari?
7770060	7770780	Caramari?
7772220	7776380	Thank you, down badling, for the tip that you have.
7778140	7780460	Be proven from the psych ward, actually, though,
7780460	7782220	for real, for real, could you imagine?
7782220	7783580	I could pull that off.
7783580	7784460	Don't think I couldn't.
7785420	7787500	All you need to do is a bit of bribery.
7787500	7788780	Imagine, like, I'll be like,
7788780	7790220	look, let me get my nails done.
7790220	7793260	I'll give you a one-hour ASMR session through your heads.
7793260	7795820	Like, I'll give you the, like, headpats for one hour.
7795820	7796300	Boom.
7796300	7796620	Right.
7796620	7796940	There.
7796940	7797740	I got the stuff.
7797740	7798940	I got my nails done.
7798940	7800380	Okay, next thing I need.
7800380	7804380	I need materials and supplies and PC and monitor,
7804380	7805020	and I need a room.
7805020	7807500	So I'm actually in the staff room right now, okay?
7807500	7809820	I'm in the staff room of the asylum.
7810860	7812380	And they're just letting me be it
7812380	7814380	because I'm not giving them any tip when I'm like this.
7816940	7817900	Oh, God, Gira.
7818460	7820380	Gira's back, back, back.
7820380	7822140	Yeah, this is back, back, back.
7822220	7826380	Yes, this is back, yes, this is back, yes, this is back.
7826380	7827580	Do, do, do.
7827580	7829420	Don't ask why she's in that pose.
7830140	7830700	Don't ask.
7832540	7833420	Thank you for the tip.
7833420	7833900	Bam.
7835340	7836700	I think I'm in black today.
7841260	7842140	Yep.
7842140	7843180	Black, if you see that.
7843180	7843500	Yep.
7844780	7845740	Why is she in that pose?
7845740	7846460	No, I don't know.
7846460	7847100	Don't ask me.
7847900	7848540	Don't ask me.
7849180	7849820	I don't know.
7849820	7850300	Hold on.
7850780	7851740	I'm just grabbing that.
7852220	7852940	I need my bobbers.
7853820	7854220	Right.
7854220	7855340	I'm ready to wrap up.
7855340	7858140	Is there anything I need to tell you?
7858140	7859580	Are you squiddin' me right now?
7860380	7862860	The face connect girls livin' a psych ward?
7864540	7865040	Oh.
7866540	7867820	I just forbidden lore.
7868620	7870540	Oregon, thank you for the tip.
7870540	7872860	Is this face connect lore that I don't know about?
7872860	7874860	You guys need to teach me about other retours.
7878380	7879820	It's weird you're in black.
7879820	7881580	I have absolutely terrible news.
7882780	7887580	I have absolutely horrific news about what I look like day to day.
7888300	7893180	I am a pale, pasty, pasty goth, okay?
7894300	7896620	That puts no effort into her appearance.
7896620	7897120	So.
7900620	7901340	You can hear like, huh?
7905260	7908700	I understand why people get parasocial over shimmers
7908700	7910540	after watching news, Ronnie.
7910540	7912460	Okay, I relearned what parasocial meant.
7912460	7914300	I thought parasocial meant you're coming to my house
7914300	7915820	and it was like dangerous.
7915820	7917500	But it's not dangerous.
7917500	7919420	And as long as it's happy, then it's good.
7919420	7920140	Like it's fine.
7921500	7922540	So thank you, Ethan.
7923260	7924700	For the nice comment.
7925420	7926620	That is how it means, yes.
7927820	7928700	You're too powerful.
7930380	7931580	And she's ever not wearing black.
7931580	7933340	I do have black rippy socks.
7934860	7935580	Terrible news.
7935580	7938060	Ronnie's in fact, demure and mindful.
7939100	7939900	That's straight up a thought.
7939900	7941740	That is technically parasocial in a way.
7941740	7945020	I thought if it was unhealthy, then it's parasocial and bad.
7945020	7947100	But if it's like, fuck, I'm actually happy
7947100	7948940	and I'm enjoying watching like shit.
7948940	7949740	I thought that was good.
7949740	7950540	Like, fuck me.
7951740	7952540	Fuck me.
7952540	7955660	Like let's jump into a match of fucking left for dead too.
7955660	7957420	We're going to finish the campaign together.
7958460	7959500	Am I going mental?
7959500	7961180	I think I might misunderstand.
7961180	7964300	Cause like, which is more grippy?
7964300	7966300	Ronnie socks or her actual bear grippers?
7966300	7967900	Oh no, I can go rip.
7967900	7969740	I have toes that fucking grip.
7969740	7971900	I assure you, I just can't do it with salt on, okay?
7972540	7973180	Trust me, bro.
7973180	7974300	I'll do it in another stream, okay?
7975100	7979660	Can get bad, but mainly just get social very vicariously.
7979660	7980620	Oh, that's a big word.
7980620	7982140	That's a big word for Elmo.
7982140	7985980	It depends how far gone mentally the person is.
7985980	7988780	I thought it was just like, you're nice to each other and shit.
7988780	7990700	Like you say, I love you, mummy.
7990700	7992220	And I say, I love you, reflin.
7992220	7994060	And it's like, Ken what?
7994060	7996220	If you don't fucking hear it, if, you know,
7996220	7997900	if you don't have got someone in your life that says,
7997900	7998300	Ken what?
7998300	7999580	I fucking love you.
7999660	8000620	Flaws and all.
8000620	8003180	Well, fucking excuse me for being the one to do it.
8003180	8005500	Like you do deserve to be told that you're loved
8005500	8009420	and you do deserve to be told that, like, yeah.
8009420	8012460	If we judged each other for like our worst fucking days,
8012460	8014300	would any of us fucking be here?
8014300	8015740	No, cause when you've had a bad day,
8015740	8017180	you've had a fucking dry day.
8017180	8017820	Ken, what I mean?
8017820	8018780	Or am I misunderstood?
8018780	8019660	I think I'm misunderstood.
8019660	8020060	I don't know.
8020700	8022700	Power socials character, great teenage girl,
8022700	8024140	loves actor, good power socials.
8024140	8025420	Ronnie and the reflins, good.
8025420	8027500	Reflins to Ronnie, good, stop or bad.
8027500	8028300	Right, okay.
8028300	8028700	Yeah.
8028700	8029500	Oh, how cute.
8029500	8030540	She's delusional.
8030540	8032300	Am I in the silence?
8032300	8034060	People can take it too seriously and go too far.
8034060	8035340	I love everything about you, Shen.
8035340	8036380	It's a spectrum.
8036380	8037900	What a good thing I'm an autist then.
8038780	8040220	I've mastered this part.
8041660	8042860	They are both good and bad.
8042860	8045180	Some people just take it too far and it's a bad thing.
8045180	8045900	I love her so much.
8045900	8047020	I love two people.
8047020	8048380	This right here.
8048380	8049580	I agree with this one.
8052220	8054140	Yeah, I just like, am I good mental?
8054140	8055180	I feel like if it was like,
8055180	8056940	I'm not playing games with you on stream.
8056940	8058060	I'm not saying I love you.
8058060	8059580	I'm not saying da, da, da, da.
8059580	8061980	I was like, why would you want to put your stonks
8061980	8064220	into a strummer like that anyway?
8066060	8068700	Isn't it not fucking nice to be told you're appreciated
8068700	8069420	and you're loved?
8069420	8071100	And yeah, you might be a lurker.
8071100	8071900	You might only talk.
8071900	8073820	You might only be able to catch me in the boards.
8073820	8077900	I am still appreciative of your time that you put into me
8077900	8080780	because you, I'll say it again.
8081740	8082940	I'll say it again.
8083660	8086700	You could literally be consuming any other content creator
8086700	8088540	right at this very second.
8088540	8090140	And yet you chose me.
8090140	8094140	The watermelon-haired hypnotic cuttlefish
8094140	8096860	that's done two hypnosis streams and called it a day.
8097900	8100460	Like, I don't know how to, I don't know how to tell you.
8100460	8101660	Oregon, thank you for the tip.
8101660	8106460	And Hydrus Simothadius.
8106460	8108380	Fucking good luck saying that right.
8108380	8109740	Thank you for becoming a member.
8109740	8111420	Please enjoy your moments.
8111420	8112540	I love your ASMR.
8112540	8116220	Well, you're going to be in for a treat tomorrow.
8116220	8116780	Oh, sure.
8116780	8117260	Yes.
8117260	8118780	And I wouldn't choose any other.
8120380	8121500	Thank you, my man.
8122540	8124380	Why are you called that?
8124380	8126620	You've got an interesting gamertag.
8127340	8129020	And birth an amazing gen.
8129020	8130460	Sounds really appealing to me.
8130460	8132780	Literally, like, do you want to make sure you're happy?
8133900	8135420	If you're streaming and you're happy
8135420	8136620	and you know what, clap your hands.
8137260	8138060	Hey, oh.
8144780	8148220	If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.
8155180	8159020	You could see the thought forming in my mind.
8159820	8164700	You could see it forming in my mind
8164700	8168140	when the words came out and I did the fucking thing.
8169660	8171260	You could see it.
8171260	8172380	I'm going to sit on my chair.
8172380	8173420	I'm going to sit on my chair.
8174700	8176140	I'm going to sit on my little game of chair.
8176140	8176780	Oh, no.
8176780	8177500	You can see the wheel.
8177500	8177820	Oh, my God.
8177820	8178380	How embarrassing.
8178380	8179740	You can see the wheel of my game of chair.
8181020	8181260	There.
8181260	8182460	Pokemon's from by the way.
8183500	8184940	We could see your hands in the shadow.
8187900	8189660	I love you, Strani, because you just seem cool.
8189660	8190460	Also, clap, clap.
8191420	8196460	Like, as you see, like, you're here to have a good time.
8197500	8198700	I'm here to have a good time.
8199260	8201180	We can play video together and stuff like that.
8201180	8203820	Parasocial can be that you really like the streamer
8203820	8206460	as a friend and want to watch and help her on one end,
8206460	8209260	but also can mean that you decide to find her
8209260	8210860	and try to visit her or hurt her.
8210860	8211740	Yeah, that's scary.
8211740	8213420	The streamer is only yours.
8213980	8215740	Depends on the mental from fan.
8216460	8218780	Yeah, like, that part's scary.
8219740	8221100	But the bit before where it's like,
8221100	8224220	fuck yeah, hold my hand through fucking Subnautica.
8224220	8225740	Like, oh, my God, I love that game.
8225740	8226460	Can we play?
8226460	8227980	I wish Subnautica was multiplayer.
8227980	8230620	I'd go fucking mental if it was multiplayer.
8231260	8232460	I'd be so brave.
8232460	8234220	I wouldn't be screaming at the reapers
8234220	8235260	or anything like that.
8236540	8236940	Thank you.
8236940	8241820	Bit of an educational link for the tit.
8241820	8243820	Yeah, I see that's right.
8243820	8246380	Personally, I'm happy to talk and flirt here.
8246380	8247980	And all the other reflins are nice too.
8247980	8251500	However, I don't think you have some deeper feelings for me,
8251500	8253020	especially since you don't actually know me.
8253740	8254620	Give me that dick.
8254620	8255420	Now, let's find out.
8260540	8261820	I'm trying so hard.
8261820	8263500	Had to become a member for the Great Vison.
8264300	8267740	Do not be expecting feet membership streams.
8267740	8268860	Oh, my gosh.
8269980	8271740	I'm so sorry to disappoint you
8271740	8273900	if you signed up for feet membership streams.
8278780	8283660	I mean, I could do oiled up earcup and ASMR
8283660	8284860	with my feet, I guess.
8284860	8292460	Like, except only expect membership streams.
8292460	8295980	Like, I don't know if you saw it.
8295980	8297500	There was Goon Cave review.
8302780	8303260	Aw.
8304060	8305820	I'd love to take photos with Mama,
8305820	8307660	even if you're a TV on a stick.
8307660	8308380	A TV on a stick?
8308380	8309900	I can even wear my Mama's sweater
8309900	8311580	under score love, under score love.
8311580	8313020	Oh, that's okay.
8313020	8313980	Thank you, basically.
8313980	8316220	I've never been to a con either.
8316220	8317500	You want me to zoom about.
8317500	8319740	Can I run you over if I'm one of those robots?
8319740	8321100	Can I run into you?
8321100	8324060	I can give you a struggle, snuggle tackle
8324060	8325260	if I'm in one of those robots
8325260	8327820	and then I have to pay like $3,000 in damages
8327820	8328780	to the equipment.
8329580	8332540	Strongly takes your con chair at will.
8335340	8336380	It's been done before.
8336380	8338380	You can run into us, but you might fall afar.
8339340	8340780	To be honest, just the yapping stream
8340780	8342860	of feet in the background would be nice to.
8343580	8345420	I do love a good yapping, honestly.
8347100	8349900	Are you do larger scale playing with viewers?
8349900	8351180	What's in life or do you have an idea
8351180	8352860	that the other ones can come in
8352860	8354300	and play mountain blade banner?
8354300	8355580	We might do SCP.
8356540	8360940	I'm going to see if we can do SCP maybe for my birthday.
8360940	8361980	No, I'm just making memes.
8361980	8362620	Sorry, my bad.
8362620	8363340	No, you're fine.
8363340	8364220	Don't apologize.
8364220	8365260	See, yeah, brainworm.
8365260	8367180	Don't let the brainworms win.
8367180	8368940	I just don't know how to say your name properly.
8376620	8377420	Thank you for the tip.
8381180	8383500	Solve a Rubik's cube with your feet real.
8386540	8387100	I might try that.
8387100	8391500	Dangerous parasociality is pretty much never a creator's fault.
8391500	8394940	Let's not forget poor Björk had a literal insane stalker
8394940	8398460	in the 90s and she never read his Dono's or Erotic Malo's.
8398460	8399020	Oh!
8399020	8401500	Healthy fans know how to love some respects
8401500	8402700	with their friends' length.
8404140	8405900	Oregon, thank you for the tip.
8405900	8406220	Okay.
8407820	8412060	And she never read his Dono's or his Erotic Marsh Malo's.
8413020	8413900	Hi, Stronny.
8413900	8417580	I want to run my tongue up your legs and thigh until I've missed.
8417580	8419980	I memorized what your legs and thighs feel like.
8423020	8423660	Right.
8423660	8427180	Mount and Blade Bannerlord and have both fan bases fight each other
8427180	8428780	in the battlefield through their Oshii.
8434460	8438780	Honestly, is that that game where the guy was like Tally Ho and he died
8439340	8442140	and they have to like cock their guns?
8443260	8446860	Like they have to like shove the barrel up and down it
8446860	8447740	and then reload it?
8447740	8448620	Like that old game?
8451980	8453980	Bannerlord is pretty hard though.
8453980	8454220	Yeah.
8455820	8456620	You're on about him.
8456620	8457740	I think he can.
8457740	8461420	There's another game that's like, it's a multiplayer game
8461420	8463980	and there was like a really funny clip and he was like,
8463980	8465740	I'm going to make it and he dies instantly.
8465740	8467260	You might be thinking of hold fast.
8468940	8470780	It's a medieval war game.
8474780	8478700	Role blocks, rust, factorial, Minecraft?
8483500	8484060	I don't know.
8484060	8486300	I don't know what I want to do for my Donathon.
8486300	8490620	I really like doing the collab on the Donathon.
8491500	8495980	I thought it would be possible to maybe do crab game stream snipe.
8499260	8500860	I thought that would be fun.
8500860	8502940	Not all the girls have to stream it if they don't want to,
8502940	8504700	but I would like them to be there
8504700	8508300	and then you guys literally have the opportunity to stream snipe
8508300	8509820	like me and my gen mates.
8509820	8512540	Not just me, like all six of us are going to be in it.
8515020	8516620	Bannerlord is with the boobs.
8516620	8517020	Okay.
8519580	8520380	Yeah, I don't know.
8520380	8521740	Crab game is a bit meh,
8521740	8525820	but you guys would like genuinely make it much more interesting.
8526780	8528460	So I'm going to see if maybe crab game
8528460	8529740	will be the stream snipe one.
8531820	8535980	Factorial can have 65,000 people on a server at once.
8536940	8537260	How?
8539820	8540140	How?
8541740	8542860	Who coded that?
8543740	8547660	That man needs some under the table support.
8547660	8550460	65,000 people on a server at once.
8550460	8552140	How is this possible?
8553580	8554540	What is crab game?
8554620	8557740	Crab game is a free to play multiplayer game
8557740	8561900	based on the squid games.
8563500	8564300	It was me.
8564300	8565020	Oh, okay.
8565020	8569820	Yeah, it is possible through even on Australian ping.
8571820	8573340	Would I be the server host?
8573340	8574700	Your PC will not survive.
8577900	8581260	The SEC secret lab will be in person.
8581260	8583820	Splatoon, I'm afraid I've not bought the game.
8583820	8585820	Apparently it's actually bad for stream sniping.
8585820	8586620	Sorry, can't see feet.
8596380	8600220	Very big game not visually demanding in special circumstances.
8600220	8601740	Crab game would be hilarious.
8601740	8604780	Factory dev is addicted to optimization, clearly.
8605580	8606780	Is SAP free?
8606780	8607580	I think so.
8607580	8609340	SAP multiplayer?
8610140	8612700	Oh wait, would it be free if it's got servers they have to run?
8614300	8616860	Wait a minute, that makes no sense.
8620860	8621340	Right.
8621340	8622380	Are you squiddin' me right now?
8622380	8623820	I don't know, are you squiddin' me right now?
8623820	8626940	Parasocial is basically one-sided relationship.
8626940	8627420	Uh-huh.
8627420	8630860	It becomes dangerous when you become too emotionally dependent
8630860	8634700	and begin thinking the one you want is your special one only.
8634700	8637820	But then it becomes worse than parasocial.
8637820	8640300	Basically a negative three tiers above.
8641500	8642140	What does that mean?
8642780	8644460	Thank you anonymous for the tip.
8644460	8650140	So yeah, that's where I'm worried.
8650140	8652060	That's why I'm always like make sure you're having fun
8652060	8653820	because you know when you're not having fun anymore?
8653820	8655900	That's when I'm like you're not enjoying yourself.
8655900	8658700	Like you're just hurting yourself and I don't want you to hurt yourself.
8659420	8661260	Like I want it to be good fun.
8661260	8664620	I want it to just be like me mucking about opening up Pokémon cards.
8664620	8666060	I have no idea how to pull.
8668860	8670140	Yeah, that kind of thing.
8670140	8673100	Lamar, she puts her feet on cam like jingle and keys.
8673100	8674140	Jingle, jingle, jingle.
8674140	8676460	Gonna redirect into mercy in five hours.
8676460	8678060	Jingle, jingle, jingle.
8678060	8679420	Jingle, jingle, jingle.
8680940	8682540	Jingle, jingle, jingle.
8682540	8683900	Five hours.
8683900	8685500	Five hours.
8685500	8686620	Jingle, jingle, jingle.
8687340	8688460	Jingle, jingle, jingle.
8692540	8695900	But yeah, if you guys are okay, I'm gonna wrap it up.
8696300	8703180	Um, can we, uh, we can.
8703180	8704860	Five hour Yapathon, honestly.
8705820	8708460	Don't be silly and subject your willy to what you don't like.
8708460	8710060	The wise words are strony calls.
8710060	8710780	Absolutely true.
8710780	8711900	Redirect in five hours.
8711900	8713100	More like five hours a stream.
8713100	8717500	No, I need to go off because I'm gonna try and get the ASMR video off.
8717500	8719260	I'm gonna update my Patreon as well.
8719900	8725820	I don't know if I can do the caller for all and dog Zemma.
8726940	8731900	Not to be confused with X-Zema, the spin condition, or Yima, X-Zema.
8733180	8734780	This is a feet puppet show.
8736060	8740700	Okay, so this is an innocent little reefling here, and this is me hiding.
8740700	8748620	Jingle, jingle, jingle.
8748620	8752140	And the thing is, you can pretend to fight, but you're not gonna win, okay?
8752140	8752780	I'm too strong.
8757740	8761340	No reefling, accept it, accept it, reefling.
8764060	8767100	Let it happen, reefletch, let it happen.
8769340	8771820	And then boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.
8773660	8774860	I'll show you the thunder side.
8775500	8777260	I fell down on my pants so long.
8778220	8779260	Who would ask to go?
8781500	8783420	A real reefling would never fight back.
8784540	8785180	The struggle.
8787100	8788940	Can you rotate strongly like a shark?
8788940	8790460	I can't show my bottom half.
8790460	8791260	It's not allowed.
8792220	8793820	Don't stop when I pass out.
8793820	8794620	Oh my god!
8799580	8800060	Prailing.
8803100	8803580	Aww.
8804140	8805420	Love you, mama.
8805420	8806300	Love you, mommy.
8806300	8807500	Love you too, reefling.
8807500	8809340	Thank you, Prailing, for the tip.
8809340	8809740	Yay.
8812300	8813820	I'm asked to come someday.
8813820	8815260	So can't stream as mommy works.
8815900	8818940	Do you want that for the membership writing stream?
8821820	8823900	I could do the membership writing streaming.
8823900	8826540	It's just a fucking video feed on my feet.
8826540	8827500	If you want.
8827500	8829340	I mean, shit, I'm not here to dictate.
8829900	8830620	Do what you want.
8830700	8835100	You're allowed to ask for the content you want to see around these parts.
8835100	8837260	I'm not going to be like, ah, don't backseat game me.
8837260	8838780	Ah, don't tell me I want to stream.
8839580	8841580	No, I'm fine with it.
8841580	8842860	I know, I'm being attacked.
8842860	8843500	Help.
8843500	8843980	I guess.
8845820	8848060	I love mommy because she gave me a place to belong.
8848060	8849340	Oh, that's so sweet.
8852060	8855980	Strongly Bottom is a WDM weapon of math.
8856540	8858940	They're bad, Sean.
8858940	8860860	My lawyer has advised me to end the drip game.
8861900	8865180	Now, unlike you, a shark, you immobilize strongy with
8865180	8868220	wrapping her in a soft blanket and giving her a head pass, and please.
8868220	8869660	Oh, you put me a bed.
8871420	8872380	Are you going to fuck me in?
8874940	8876460	You can't just tuck me in.
8877820	8880140	You have to do the other part too, or it doesn't count.
8882700	8883660	I'm not into feet.
8883660	8885180	Do what you're comfortable with.
8885180	8888940	You're like, oh, please wrap up the fucking feet, strongy.
8888940	8890220	Jesus, we get it.
8890220	8891660	You're wearing grippy socks, woman.
8892460	8894620	Please wrap it up.
8894620	8895900	I do love good wrap-ups.
8897580	8898700	I'm going to want you in.
8899900	8900780	Boko wa ya.
8902860	8905260	Right, I'll check Marshmallow one more time just to make sure.
8905260	8906380	Mommy, you're so cute.
8906380	8908620	Yeah, do you like how I get all excited when I get to do it
8908620	8910220	and really things, be anything?
8910220	8911900	Look at that toe spread.
8911900	8912780	Oh, my God.
8912780	8913900	Look at that pinky toe.
8913900	8914700	Yeah, damn.
8914700	8916300	Looks like I've webbed feet under those.
8916300	8918460	I promise you these toes separate.
8919900	8921660	Yeah, well, Mae, you're so cute today.
8921660	8922540	Thank you.
8922540	8923660	Hi, strongy.
8923660	8925260	I just wanted to say this real quick.
8925260	8926780	Thank you for your Twitter content.
8926780	8927820	It is freaking amazing.
8927820	8929420	I don't know why you sound like Elvis.
8929420	8931180	Thank you for all the fun streams and everything.
8931180	8931660	I love you.
8932300	8933740	I love you too.
8933740	8934940	I love you too.
8934940	8935820	I love you too.
8935820	8936380	Oh, yeah.
8938220	8940940	I don't know why you turned into Elvis there, but you did, okay?
8941820	8942380	You did.
8943340	8944380	Hi, strongy.
8944380	8945500	Hi, mithan.
8945500	8947660	I love you with every fiber of my being.
8947660	8950140	You have quickly became my kami-oshi.
8950140	8950860	Oh, no.
8950860	8954060	I feel so nervous when you call me kami-oshi.
8954860	8957660	I'm like, aren't you disappointed in me?
8958540	8961340	I was like, could you not pick a little bit better?
8962860	8965580	You're the most wonderful person I've ever known.
8965580	8967420	You make us all feel loved and appreciated.
8967420	8969740	You generally make my day better just with your yapping.
8969740	8971500	Yeah, you're like when I do feet puppetin.
8972220	8972540	Yeah.
8973340	8976860	I'm proud to be your riefling and call you my kami-oshi.
8976860	8979100	I will always love you and be here to support you.
8979100	8980220	Oh, thank you, riefling.
8980220	8981100	I love you too.
8981100	8982140	That's so sweet.
8983180	8985820	Nice screen to open up streams to.
8985820	8987020	Yeah, I wouldn't do it very.
8987020	8988380	I would close this.
8988380	8989260	The stream's over.
8991020	8993900	Let me put my feet on your mouth to silence you.
8995180	8995820	It's okay.
8995820	8996780	Just let it happen.
8997420	8998380	Just let it happen.
8999100	9002220	Oh, yeah.
9002220	9005420	There's one more hand cream stream at the end of this week.
9005420	9008220	And then I believe that's all my hand cam for quite a while.
9011980	9013100	Let me check my schedule.
9013100	9014780	I'll let you have my schedule open right now.
9015740	9018620	I'll put 25 Tenga celebration.
9018620	9019660	Soft clay form.
9019660	9020940	So that's hand cam.
9020940	9022300	And then it's dragon quest.
9022300	9023260	Conquer is bad for a day.
9023260	9025420	That's getting delayed for something else.
9025820	9031340	I've got a deep rock galactica stream snipe next week.
9032140	9033340	Like the next next week.
9034380	9036220	Star Wars Battlefront campaign's coming up.
9036220	9037500	ASMR stream's coming up.
9038380	9040700	Let me snuggle up to you, ASMR stream.
9041500	9042220	See how it goes.
9042220	9043180	Rock and stone.
9045820	9048460	That moment when the Bluetooth connects in the car.
9048460	9051820	You can see what the positive messages do to mama.
9051820	9054700	Close her toes go wild and erratic.
9054700	9056860	Yeah, we can see to the adorable mama.
9056860	9059260	Wait, my toes reacted to your messages?
9059820	9060300	Stop.
9060300	9061580	Did they actually?
9061580	9061980	Hold on.
9061980	9063580	I'm going to get that shit off the screen.
9063580	9065740	Did my toes react to your messages?
9067660	9069020	I'm having pepega.
9069020	9070140	Thank you, Pete Kling.
9071740	9073020	No permission for conquer.
9073020	9075020	No, no, just to delay it for something else.
9075980	9078060	Did my fucking toes react?
9078060	9079100	That's embarrassing.
9079100	9080620	I'm putting them under the cover now.
9080620	9081260	What?
9081260	9081820	Oh my God.
9081820	9086220	I was like, you got me feeling things and stuff.
9088300	9089020	That's a fact.
9090140	9090940	I don't know that.
9091980	9096460	I've got Left 4 Dead Streamsnip campaign on the 4th of October.
9097500	9099340	We'll go back to Left 4 Dead.
9099340	9101740	I think Conker's Bad Friday's getting delayed
9101740	9105740	and we'll try and wrap up Subnautica on that day.
9106940	9107580	I'm just looking.
9107580	9109900	I'm just straight up leaking the rest of my schedule.
9109900	9111500	I've got an ASMR maid roleplay.
9112220	9113260	Professor Layton.
9113260	9114460	I've got High on Life.
9114460	9115740	Never played that.
9115740	9118540	I've got Baking My Genmates.
9118540	9119980	It's coming up in October.
9119980	9121340	That's probably the next handcam.
9121340	9124140	But I'm calming it on the handcam for quite a while
9124140	9125820	because I've had quite a few back-to-back ones.
9127580	9128860	Not until I get new nails.
9128860	9129340	Okay?
9129340	9130140	I need new nails.
9130140	9130940	Her feet timed.
9130940	9131580	She covered them.
9131580	9132460	Am I ruining that?
9132460	9133100	I don't know.
9133100	9135420	Are my fucking toes reacting to your messages?
9136860	9137660	I'm like, oh my God.
9137660	9138860	That's embarrassing.
9138860	9140380	You can see me squirm.
9140380	9141020	Great for me.
9141020	9144780	I'm like, a fellow toe spreader?
9144780	9145740	What have you sent?
9145740	9148460	Are you sent a fucking video of your feet?
9151100	9151820	Hold on.
9151820	9154780	Have you just sent me a video of your feet in Marshmallow?
9156700	9157100	All right.
9158300	9164620	Ruflin, get your dogs off of my screen.
9165580	9166380	That's hilarious.
9166380	9168780	I'm like, why is your feet so veiny, though?
9169020	9171020	Are you a runner?
9172860	9175020	Why is your feet so pale at the knuckles,
9175020	9176700	but then you have like blood flow out,
9176700	9178380	like your ankle and your toe area?
9182300	9183900	You can't just ask someone that.
9183900	9185100	Why are you white?
9185740	9186780	That's funniest fuck.
9186780	9187500	Thank you, Ruflin.
9187500	9188300	That's hilarious.
9188300	9189820	Thank you for showing me your grippers.
9192220	9195980	It's a vampire vascular guy, I think so.
9196700	9200220	In her reaction, hmm.
9200220	9200700	Hi, mom.
9200700	9201260	I love you.
9201260	9203260	I can't wait to see what my technical comes.
9203260	9204380	Oh, okay.
9204380	9205340	Love you too, Ruflin.
9207580	9209020	Why are you white?
9209020	9209580	Hi, Johnny.
9209580	9210700	I just want to send this real quick.
9214620	9215820	What other stuff?
9215820	9216780	I'm playing control.
9216780	9218620	Apparently it's SCP adjacent.
9219180	9223020	Mines of Moria stream got delayed way at the end of October.
9223020	9226300	And then I'm going to do a test crowd control stream,
9226300	9228140	possibly, on Pokemon Emerald.
9229900	9231340	I don't know how that works, though.
9231900	9234220	I'm going to have to look into it.
9234220	9238940	I've got God of War coming up in November.
9238940	9241260	I've got BioShock Infinite in November.
9242380	9244940	I've got Mario 64 in November.
9244940	9247020	Johnny, do you really plan this far ahead?
9247020	9247260	Yes.
9249180	9249420	Yeah.
9250380	9252620	I literally have on the calendar
9252620	9257180	the May 4th Lego Star Wars Complete Saga.
9257180	9258860	Like, yes, I plan this far ahead.
9260060	9261580	And I change things out, okay?
9262540	9263900	The OG or the new...
9263900	9265340	Which God of War?
9267340	9269900	Wait, is it PS PlayStation only?
9271420	9272780	Yes, if you'll stop me.
9272940	9273980	Yes, if you'll stop me.
9278860	9280460	Is it PS PlayStation only?
9280460	9281660	That might have to get changed.
9285100	9288540	The question should be if she's supposed to plan that far ahead?
9288540	9289740	Oh, I never read that.
9289740	9290940	No, don't message me that.
9290940	9292300	I've never read it in time.
9293260	9294380	You are a planner.
9295180	9296540	God of War is on PC.
9296540	9298300	Okay, that'll be the one I'm playing then.
9298300	9299420	The one that's on PC.
9299420	9299980	So we're there.
9302780	9304940	I hope you like Bioshock Infinite.
9304940	9305260	Yes.
9306060	9307020	What games are we talking about?
9307020	9308140	That's PlayStation exclusive.
9308140	9310780	I thought there was a God of War game that was PlayStation exclusive.
9313500	9314220	Look at these feet.
9316940	9318300	This is me cricketing.
9318300	9319340	You ever heard of a woman like,
9319340	9320780	I'm cricketing my feet.
9320780	9321260	This is it.
9321260	9323100	It's literally just a self-soothing behavior.
9323100	9323980	There's nothing more to it.
9323980	9324780	And it's a bit warm.
9325820	9327660	Teasing strong even redacted messages
9327660	9329260	because she can't read them in time.
9329260	9331500	No, it wakes me up.
9331500	9333340	I luckily, I caught that.
9333340	9334220	But oh yeah.
9334940	9336540	Oh, it really inverts my nipples
9336540	9338300	when I'm like reading halfway through your message
9338300	9339020	and then you're done.
9339020	9341900	I'm like, never got to finish it.
9343420	9344380	It wasn't me.
9345580	9347180	Damn, came at the best time.
9347180	9348220	The wrap up, yeah.
9349100	9351260	The original ones are P.O.A. station.
9351260	9351580	Yeah.
9352860	9353340	Momay.
9354540	9354940	Yeah.
9354940	9355900	Wait, what did I say?
9356940	9357820	Strony, I love you.
9357820	9358940	I love you too, this one.
9358940	9359420	It what?
9359420	9360220	Wait, what?
9360220	9361820	Am I getting, did I say something?
9364380	9365260	Do you think we could do
9365260	9367900	Trouble in Terror's Town Gmod Streams
9367900	9369260	now if you're the one hosting that?
9370540	9371180	Possibly.
9372140	9375020	I'll need to see if it shows IP or anything
9375020	9376540	like that, but possibly.
9376540	9378220	I think it's held by Gmod servers.
9378940	9380540	Oh, my nipples being inverted.
9380540	9381420	Yes, sorry.
9382220	9382860	Sorry.
9382860	9384780	I said, stop doing redacted.
9384780	9386540	I have no clue what users are saying.
9386540	9387420	No, I scoopy do.
9388380	9389740	Do you want tummy pics?
9389740	9391100	Am I allowed tummy pics?
9392540	9394860	Stop, I can't fucking read.
9394860	9396380	Strony, try not to overthink.
9396380	9398780	It's because I finished like my thingy
9400620	9401900	so quickly, like I don't,
9402780	9404460	I'm already onto the next topic
9404460	9405660	that I'm talking about
9407260	9410300	that I've no got a clue what's going on.
9411420	9413100	Yeah, I've got one more hand cam stream
9413100	9415180	on October, then I have nothing planned after that.
9415180	9417020	So if you're sick of seeing me
9417020	9419260	and not a Vtuber model,
9419260	9421500	it's because I did just a lot,
9421500	9422940	okay, but I'm wrapping it up.
9423980	9425020	I'm wrapping up.
9426380	9427580	Give mommy a head tap.
9427580	9429180	Stop with the redacted.
9429180	9430300	I'm missing them all.
9430300	9431740	One of the two new God of War games
9431740	9433260	in the first one is a PC.
9433260	9434380	I missed that, right?
9434380	9435340	What is redacted?
9435980	9437900	When you delete your message,
9437900	9441340	it says for me, message retracted.
9441340	9444700	Oh, those are two different words.
9444940	9447100	Retracted is take them back.
9447100	9450220	Redacted is hidden information and adult feeling.
9450220	9451020	Okay.
9452860	9454620	It's not as, stop!
9454620	9456380	I was just saying that!
9456380	9457820	Mommy is super sad.
9457820	9458540	Thank you.
9458540	9459980	Redacted is a joke from S.E.C.
9459980	9462620	about where the S.E.C. writer says,
9462620	9464060	Shania, I deleted my message
9464060	9466700	if I make a minor spelling error.
9466700	9467820	You struggle reading as it is.
9467820	9468940	I don't want to make it harder.
9468940	9470140	Okay, real unsure though.
9470860	9472860	We love to shume regardless with this hand.
9473500	9475420	I can't even read.
9476540	9478140	See how it even shows up in the hang?
9478140	9480460	It just says, it's just gone.
9480460	9481260	It's just no there.
9483500	9485260	Wait, before you,
9485260	9488460	I wanted to say that I think you're really funny
9488460	9489180	and you're my ocean.
9489180	9490380	Well, get right, I get right.
9491660	9492780	Are you doing okay?
9492780	9494860	Yeah, they're keeping me for a few more weeks
9494860	9496300	at the asylum, as you can see,
9496300	9497820	by the certified grippy socks.
9499500	9501260	But no, we had a really good Pokémon haul.
9501260	9501820	I enjoyed that.
9501820	9503420	I'm not buying more Pokémon though, fuck that.
9511660	9513900	Not one, I genuinely haven't had one.
9513900	9517020	Unless I missed it or it got blocked by the filters,
9517020	9518140	I generally haven't had one.
9520700	9521500	Generally haven't had one.
9522140	9524540	As I was saying, I think I've scared yous all.
9524540	9526620	Like, I think yous are scared of me
9526620	9528620	because I don't really get much
9529420	9531020	hmm and stuff and I'm like,
9531020	9532220	I think I'm just scared yous.
9533020	9535100	But then a refland sent me a marshmallow
9535100	9535820	and they were like,
9538460	9540060	like, I feel satisfied.
9540060	9542380	Like, I don't need to be a tumor anymore.
9542380	9544140	I'm just happy he's like watching you
9544140	9545820	and I'm like, oh, tea.
9547500	9549260	And I'm like, oh, okay.
9549260	9553660	Thank you, big belly-ing for the tip.
9555020	9557100	It's just weird to send that stuff randomly.
9557100	9559180	Oh, I mean,
9562380	9564300	do I need to, I'm down?
9567820	9568700	Do it real.
9569980	9571500	He's spitting real facts.
9571500	9573900	Oh, well someone said that.
9573900	9575740	They were like, I used to be a chronic
9576460	9578940	anchor but I'm not anymore.
9578940	9582700	And I was like, aren't I the problem though?
9582700	9586060	Because like, I do like non-stop,
9586060	9589340	shut the fuck up in about ink and this and teasing and that.
9589340	9590620	And I'm like, aren't I the problem?
9590620	9593660	But the refland says no.
9593660	9594700	And I'm like, okay.
9594700	9595820	But aren't I the problem though?
9595820	9596300	But no.
9600620	9603260	Mummy, did you know redactors yet?
9603260	9603820	What?
9603820	9605500	Don't worry, I'll turn just a minute.
9606700	9608460	Don't be shy, put some more.
9608460	9610300	I don't want to be hate, I just want to be happy.
9610300	9613180	Yeah, yeah, like basically I think
9613180	9614460	is what I boil down to.
9616220	9620220	Hmm, don't send unasked for stuff
9620220	9621900	if a thing does get full though.
9621900	9624220	I guess I'm such an exception to the rule.
9624220	9627260	I think actually I want to just do the brainworn stuff a bit more.
9627260	9629580	I was like, I'm going to be honest,
9630300	9633340	have you been fucked up by a VTuber before?
9633340	9636060	Because you're so terrified to like say these things to me
9636060	9637340	or do things around me.
9637340	9640620	I'm like, what nasty VTuber had a reaction to you
9640620	9643260	that was so visceral to make you so cautious?
9643980	9646620	Like, was someone nasty to you?
9646620	9648540	Do I need to go speak to the manager?
9650700	9652300	Like that's such a shame.
9652300	9656380	I feel really bad that whenever you interact,
9656380	9657500	instead of being like,
9657500	9659740	oh, strong is like having a hoot and a holler,
9661660	9663260	you're like, oh my god, I've messed up.
9663260	9664780	She's going to end up blocking me,
9664780	9665820	muting me or whatever that.
9665820	9668300	Like, I assure you I've not muted one motherfucking person.
9668300	9671740	I've muted two people on Marshmallow.
9671820	9673580	One was harassment,
9673580	9677420	and then the other one was really random racism
9677420	9678620	that wasn't even shown at me.
9679420	9680780	That was a bit bizarre.
9680780	9682700	I don't know what about, I can't decide for the message.
9683580	9685180	Not VTubers, but girls.
9685180	9687500	Most VTubers don't like weird comments.
9687500	9688860	Oh boy!
9688860	9691020	You are in for a treat over at your home.
9691740	9692860	It's not even just online.
9692860	9694380	It's what we've been taught in Relay.
9696140	9698460	I mean, I guess in Relay,
9698460	9700940	you wouldn't like go up to some random check
9700940	9703420	and it can be like, hmm, your feet.
9703420	9705660	But you know, here.
9705660	9707580	And the gloves are fucking off, okay?
9707580	9708380	My gloves are off.
9709260	9709580	Feet!
9709580	9710300	Hi, DEMPA.
9710300	9711740	Sorry, we've wrapped up the Pokemon,
9711740	9713820	but we did play Pokemon for real for real, okay?
9713820	9714940	Look, it's real.
9714940	9716540	I promise I opened up Pokemon.
9716540	9717980	It may not look like it, but yeah.
9719740	9722780	I inked DEMPA real once.
9722780	9724220	I think it's just good manners.
9724220	9725820	The world has been hard on the phyllis,
9725820	9726700	darling, you know.
9727340	9729180	Culture is told is not to be openly,
9729740	9730860	hmm.
9730860	9731820	I guess, yeah.
9731820	9733900	No, I do understand that.
9733900	9735180	I guess that would explain why
9735180	9736860	some overthinking comes into it,
9737500	9739580	because I do feel bad when,
9739580	9741500	like, we have a carry-on on streaming and,
9741500	9745580	you know, I'll go brainwrote for a bit
9745580	9746940	and then I'll check Marshmallow
9746940	9747900	and it's apologies.
9747900	9749900	And I'm like, what are you apologizing for?
9749900	9751340	We're having fun together.
9751980	9753740	We're playing games together.
9753740	9754700	We're chatting.
9754700	9755900	We're, I'm reading chat.
9755900	9756940	I'm reading you.
9756940	9758220	I know there's lurkers,
9758940	9760620	if you're lurking in the shadow, don't be.
9761180	9762620	Don't feel forced to talk,
9762620	9764140	but, like, I know you're there
9764140	9765500	and you're just bitching in.
9765500	9766940	There's a man, I'm bitching in.
9767980	9769500	Wait, people send apologies?
9769500	9770220	I kid you not.
9770220	9771580	People, like, are literally, like,
9771580	9773100	strongy, I'm sorry that I did this,
9773100	9773580	I did that.
9773580	9775340	And I'm like, oh my God,
9775340	9777340	like, you've actually been so fucked up
9777340	9779100	because of something before.
9779100	9779740	Hin Law.
9779740	9780780	Hi, lurker here.
9780780	9781980	Hi, lurker.
9781980	9782940	Lurker Ling.
9782940	9783980	We'll call you lurkers.
9784620	9787260	Um, mm-mm-mm.
9787260	9789340	But yeah, like, uh, hello, lurker.
9789340	9789980	Hi.
9789980	9792620	Oh, you're being brave, little lurkers.
9793980	9795500	Are you feeling the pressure?
9795500	9797420	Did your heart rate go up when you typed?
9798620	9799900	Lurker Love.
9799900	9801580	Yes, I know you're a little lurker.
9801580	9803500	You're allowed to lurk, it's fine.
9803500	9805340	Um, I'm not, like, feel the pressure,
9805340	9807580	like, you must talk or anything like that.
9807580	9809340	I feel a genuine level of acceptance,
9809340	9810300	more freedom in a sense.
9810300	9811820	Brain feels better when I sit in stream,
9811820	9813900	whether it's lurking or participating.
9813900	9815340	We are gentlemen first.
9815340	9816620	Oh my God, hold on, wait.
9816620	9817660	Wait, I have the sound bite.
9817660	9819740	Oh no, I don't, because it's not popping up.
9819740	9820700	A true gentleman.
9821740	9824220	Um, I almost had a heart attack.
9824220	9825180	Oh my God, stop!
9825180	9826460	Wait, am I elevating your stream?
9826460	9828860	I was a lurker before the stream, yeah.
9828860	9830220	No, you're allowed to be lurker.
9830220	9831820	For any lurker that's, like, I don't,
9831820	9832780	I'm too scared.
9832780	9834460	Don't worry, you don't have to,
9834460	9836940	you don't have to say anything like a true gentleman.
9836940	9838940	Um, I'm just straight up lurking.
9838940	9841980	And by it, let's just say my beacher bird.
9841980	9843420	Okay, that was really good.
9843420	9845260	You win comment of the stream.
9846940	9848060	Plop, plop, plop, plop.
9848060	9849340	You win comment of the stream.
9849340	9850380	That was actually really good.
9850940	9852380	I'm a gentleman and a scholar,
9852380	9853660	but I like Dom's one.
9853660	9854700	Oh, you like Dom me?
9855820	9858380	Okay, thankfully I didn't send one.
9858380	9861260	I find it very hard sometimes having brain worms in the path
9861260	9862460	and I felt like sending me apology.
9862460	9863260	Good thing I didn't.
9863260	9864460	No, it's not a bother.
9864460	9866940	No, don't get brain worms if I haven't brain worms
9866940	9867740	and apologize.
9869340	9871980	Don't get brain worms if you've apologized either.
9871980	9873980	Hold on, pause, pause.
9873980	9875660	Don't get brain worms either.
9875660	9877020	It's okay to apologize,
9877020	9879420	but what I'm trying to say is you don't like to apologize.
9880380	9881180	Wait, grug?
9882220	9883180	Grug like women.
9883180	9884220	Grug like men in prayer?
9884860	9886300	Grug as in red?
9886300	9886620	Grug?
9889420	9890380	Red, is that you?
9892700	9895660	Thank you, bab, for the tip, my little guru guru.
9896620	9898380	Oh no, the brain worms have brain worms.
9898380	9898700	No.
9902220	9904060	Is that red or am I just...
9904780	9906220	Brain worms squared?
9906220	9910700	I feel like if you read more suggestive and you rap positive,
9910700	9912860	it's all good, but I'm not saying anything wrong with either.
9912860	9914140	You're too kind, I love you.
9914140	9915180	I love you, sir, you're fun.
9915180	9915660	Oh, hi.
9916780	9917980	Oh, hi there.
9917980	9919660	Oh, should I start calling lurkers out?
9919660	9920940	No, that puts you on the spot.
9920940	9921580	That's not fun.
9922220	9926540	Sometimes it's tough to be a gentleman and a bit on the side.
9926540	9927100	Don't worry.
9929500	9932940	I lurked two weeks before I interacted with you for the first thing
9932940	9935820	because I want to have a good idea of what it's okay to say to you.
9935820	9938460	No, I feel like literally I have to be like,
9938460	9942060	all right, reflins, remember when we go into other people's streams,
9942060	9943100	they're not like me.
9945580	9946700	Grug as in a caveman.
9946700	9948860	Ah, okay, okay, I'm mistaken identity.
9948860	9953100	My apologies, guru, at the door via a doorbell.
9954620	9956860	Oh god, now I have to apologize even harder.
9956860	9957660	No.
9957660	9959340	You're not to apologize even harder.
9959340	9959740	Stop it.
9963660	9964460	Hey.
9966620	9968780	Mom, I like to send you an ink tax.
9969740	9970460	What the fuck?
9970460	9971100	That's so good.
9971660	9974140	The ink tax, the ink tax.
9975260	9977900	Mommy's tried hard, so you better pay the price.
9977900	9980460	The ink tax, the ink tax.
9981580	9983900	Mommy's been a tease, so you better call for that.
9984460	9986300	So anyway, when it comes to talking to you during streams,
9986300	9988140	I get nervous when talking.
9988140	9991100	I find you so beautifully attractive and you get nervous.
9991100	9991420	No.
9992940	9993900	Are your feet cold?
9993900	9994860	They actually are.
9994860	9997340	I'm getting a bit chilly.
9997340	9998540	I'm getting a bit chilly.
9998540	9999500	Are you okay?
9999500	10000380	I'm getting a bit chilly.
10000380	10000860	Is that cool?
10001500	10004780	I don't chat often in streams or really post comments.
10004780	10006780	I felt like the eye of Saruman found me
10006780	10008220	when you replied to my comment.
10011260	10012540	Do you have a ring for me?
10013500	10016220	Do you still have the cherry associated with that ring?
10018300	10019500	I really love you all so much.
10019500	10021580	I'm a lurker, nine times out of 10, but when...
10022300	10023500	But I talk when I can.
10023500	10024620	I really love you all so much.
10024620	10026380	Aw, Riefling.
10026380	10028300	You guys are super funny and sweet and lovely.
10028300	10029500	Thanks for having me, Riefling.
10029500	10031100	Aw, that was so nice.
10031100	10031660	Thank you.
10032940	10035020	Hey, I wonder if she realized she's reacting with her feet again.
10036220	10036700	Meow.
10039500	10041580	No, you can't prove it, okay?
10042940	10044460	I am the danger.
10044460	10047260	What if you tell them that they apologize to get punished?
10047260	10048380	I feel like they'd want that.
10049340	10052220	That Riefling experience, the whole body turns up.
10052220	10053500	Bless all.
10055660	10056540	Does it make you...
10056540	10058220	I like when you tell me stories,
10058220	10060780	like it makes you smile when I read your message.
10060780	10063420	I'm like, ah, I can't handle it.
10063420	10064940	It's so fucking cute.
10064940	10068620	Like the thought of you cheesing behind your keyboard right now.
10069260	10070700	Stop being so cute.
10070700	10071740	I'm gonna do it.
10071740	10073820	I'm gonna start passing out the R-word.
10073820	10077180	And like the thought of you cheesing behind your little keyboard
10077180	10079260	is so cute.
10079260	10080700	It's so fucking cute.
10082380	10084380	The chat reflects the true word.
10084380	10085340	Shawnee is so cute.
10085340	10086940	That's why you start quivering, dimple.
10087980	10089180	Cuteness aggression.
10089180	10091820	I mean, of course, we get happy if you read our message.
10091820	10094060	We are shy when you do that.
10095740	10097500	That happens to everyone.
10097500	10098460	Riefling.
10098460	10099580	You stop being so cute.
10099580	10100860	It happens to me through real.
10104380	10107020	The amount of dopamine I get when you read my chat message
10107420	10111340	or when I get a like from you on Twitter since we're flying.
10111340	10113980	Oh, I don't, I'm really bad at using Twitter.
10113980	10115100	Actually, I'll tell you what.
10115100	10116940	I've got a funny Twitter post.
10116940	10118300	I'm gonna post this in TM.
10120220	10121900	You better start our wordness then.
10121900	10123020	Oh, deals of deals.
10123020	10124380	Shit, you got me.
10124380	10125340	You caught me.
10125340	10126780	All right, line up.
10126780	10127500	Line up.
10127500	10128060	Who's first?
10131340	10132700	Twitter hate, honestly.
10132700	10134140	I'm just rubbish actually.
10134940	10137580	I told the giggle when I got a comment right out there.
10137580	10138380	I need squid mirrors though.
10138380	10139260	No need for them.
10140140	10142620	Brain dead VTuber fan.
10142620	10144540	You're not brain dead.
10144540	10145260	You have to be nice.
10145260	10147420	You need to name yourself positive things.
10147420	10150940	You should call yourself two brain cell VTuber fan.
10150940	10151820	There's your new.
10151820	10154300	And then you can celebrate each new brain cell yet.
10154300	10155180	Thank you for coming to member.
10155180	10156940	Please enjoy your moments.
10156940	10158940	Stream went from wholesome to hate to wholesome.
10158940	10161260	Yeah, that, yeah.
10161260	10161980	Not gonna lie.
10161980	10163820	That stuff kind of happens around here.
10163900	10165020	Witness me.
10165020	10166300	Me, me, me, I'm fine.
10167020	10168860	Brain raw VTuber fan.
10168860	10171820	Well, honestly, if you're a member for me, I'll take it.
10171820	10173580	Stop redacting your messages.
10174780	10176380	I sent some letters during dead hours.
10176380	10179020	I'm so embarrassed to hear you read it on stream.
10179020	10181500	You get embarrassed, but your marshmallows are anonymous.
10182060	10182860	I can't even tell.
10184380	10186300	Sorry for not having sent a marshmallow yet.
10186300	10187020	Please forgive me.
10187020	10188460	No, don't be sorry.
10188460	10190700	That's, don't, don't be sorry.
10190700	10192620	Our wordness is gonna start happening if we start.
10192780	10193420	Mmm.
10195100	10196860	You just typed message redacted.
10196860	10198220	That's not actually been redacted.
10199420	10200540	Welcome to strongy stream.
10200540	10201580	If it's your first time.
10204780	10205020	Hi.
10206220	10207900	Did I pop your cherry?
10207900	10208860	Maybe a little bit.
10210220	10211660	Little cherry popping today.
10211660	10213100	If you see me for the first time.
10214220	10214940	Oh, fuck.
10214940	10216060	My ankle's about to crack.
10216060	10216380	Sorry.
10217660	10219260	Ah, my ankle's about to crack.
10219260	10220380	Sorry, mommy.
10220380	10222220	I apologize for not giving a fuck.
10223100	10223420	Yes.
10225260	10225980	I saw that.
10225980	10227500	I read yes before you got it.
10228380	10229260	I'm sorry for that.
10229260	10230540	Reefling being sorry.
10230540	10230780	Okay.
10231500	10231980	Oh, wait.
10231980	10232540	Hold on.
10232540	10234860	I'll tell you how I get used to stop saying sorry.
10235500	10239100	I'll tell you how I'll get used to stop saying sorry.
10239900	10240940	You already know.
10242300	10244060	You already know.
10245340	10249180	I know how I'm gonna, I see one more sorry.
10249260	10252700	And if I see one more sorry in that chat.
10253420	10254540	It's getting done.
10255740	10256700	Please don't.
10256700	10257580	I'm sorry, mommy.
10257580	10258140	Don't do it.
10258140	10258700	Don't do it.
10260220	10260860	Message.
10260860	10261420	Sorry.
10261420	10262140	Sorry.
10262140	10262540	Okay.
10262540	10263420	You're getting punished.
10265180	10266540	Naughty refling.
10267660	10267900	Yeah.
10267900	10269180	You feel that pressure?
10270540	10271420	Bad boy.
10271420	10272700	You know, bad boy.
10273980	10274780	See this?
10275980	10279100	We're totally punished.
10279100	10280460	Bad refling.
10281660	10282460	Don't do it.
10282460	10283340	It's too late.
10283340	10284220	It's too late.
10286300	10287500	I'll threaten again.
10287500	10288620	Look, I'm threatening again.
10288620	10289340	No more s's.
10290780	10291340	Message.
10291340	10291740	Sorry.
10291740	10292300	Reduct.
10294060	10295340	But what about gen two?
10297020	10298380	I think we're like what, a month?
10299420	10299740	No.
10302700	10303500	Oh, shit.
10305420	10307500	I'm gonna be pregnant in less than a month.
10309260	10309980	Oh my god.
10309980	10311420	It's the 17th today.
10313260	10314220	Oh no.
10314220	10314860	This can't be.
10315740	10318860	I'm gonna be pregnant in a fucking month with gen two.
10318860	10319100	Shit.
10320780	10321100	Shit.
10325420	10326940	Better get your tentacles ready.
10327580	10329180	We're gonna need a big load for gen two.
10331900	10332700	Prepare yourself.
10332700	10333020	Yes.
10333660	10334460	Dying less fast.
10335260	10337420	No, I need to get pregnant with them.
10337420	10338540	I need to be pregnant with them.
10338540	10339900	I'm getting pregnant on my birthday.
10341580	10342700	I've got some work to do.
10344860	10346540	Is that what you're denialings are for?
10347660	10349500	Do you get a special model?
10349500	10350780	When I'm pregnant,
10352620	10354860	you want me to have a special toggle?
10354860	10356140	I think it would cost a lot.
10356780	10358460	Uh, I don't know.
10358460	10359820	Do you want me to fucking...
10360860	10364380	Oh, my big swollen belly with my big swollen milkers?
10364380	10366620	You want a pregnant version of Strawny?
10366620	10367180	Jesus.
10369420	10369980	Jesus.
10371980	10372300	Yes.
10373500	10375900	Is there anyone that's done a prego feature for model?
10377580	10379580	I just want you to see where Dune's cuddle.
10380620	10381820	I'm not gonna do three-deal.
10381820	10383660	You can't hear when I cuddle this microphone.
10383660	10384460	It's so annoying.
10384460	10385340	I can, like, rub it.
10386460	10387980	That's gonna scare the new people away.
10387980	10389980	Yeah, I think that's probably more of an incident joke.
10389980	10391020	Yeah, no, pregnant.
10391020	10393420	Kids, just place the prego barely P&D on top.
10393420	10395420	Yeah, that's a lot cheaper as well.
10395420	10395900	You know what?
10395900	10396220	You're right.
10396220	10397180	That's a lot cheaper.
10397180	10398300	Stretch marks, Strawny.
10398300	10400060	I already have them on my thighs.
10400060	10404460	I used to be a plank, and then when puberty hit,
10405100	10408380	my hips, like, doubled in size overnight.
10408380	10409660	It was bizarre.
10409660	10410780	It was truly bizarre.
10410780	10411740	So I have, like, stretch...
10411740	10414140	Like, did they call them tiger stripes or something there?
10414140	10415660	It's not stretch marks anymore.
10415660	10417900	But I have them on my thighs and my hips.
10417900	10418700	And no, my thighs.
10418700	10419580	Sorry, my hips.
10420540	10421420	Hips only.
10421420	10421740	Brea...
10423260	10423740	Proof?
10425020	10426620	Are you not seeing my...
10426620	10428140	Oh, I don't have a shirt on under there.
10429580	10430620	Okay, am I going crazy?
10430620	10431980	Have I never showed you guys my...
10435020	10436140	I don't know if you can tell.
10436140	10436620	Hang on.
10436620	10438460	I don't know if you can tell, because I'm like...
10438460	10439260	Oh, you can't.
10439260	10440140	Holy shit, you can't.
10440860	10441660	Wait, no.
10443500	10444620	Oh, you can't tell?
10444620	10445900	Oh, I look like a plank.
10445900	10447820	Oh, well, I'm not actually a plank.
10447820	10448300	It's just...
10448300	10449820	It's the bad camera angle, okay?
10451660	10452700	I was like, have them on!
10454060	10455660	You know, kind of go a little bit hip-pitch.
10455740	10457180	You know, if you've ever been on the alt-wear.
10457980	10458860	That's a lot of hip-pitch.
10459580	10460940	You're a plank from the front.
10460940	10461820	Yeah, there you go.
10461820	10462300	Plank.
10462300	10462780	Plank.
10462780	10463260	Plank.
10464620	10466060	I can't find my glasses.
10466060	10468460	Hips for birthing veal or generations, literally.
10469420	10471420	You edit it out of the picture.
10471420	10472140	My hips?
10474140	10475340	I smooth my skin.
10476060	10477420	I don't have nice skin.
10477420	10478220	Like, I have skin.
10479020	10480540	Smooth the skin in my face, but I don't...
10482220	10483020	Oh, the marks!
10483020	10483980	Yeah, I edit the marks.
10483980	10484540	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
10484540	10485100	The skin.
10485100	10485980	I fix the skin.
10488700	10489740	Try to remove everything.
10490620	10491420	Birthing hips.
10491980	10493020	Stony's personality.
10493020	10493900	Breeding bros win.
10499500	10500620	She has normal skin.
10500620	10501340	The shock and horror.
10501340	10502060	I know.
10502060	10502700	It's terrible.
10503260	10505580	Mummy, when you read my messages or when you, like,
10505580	10507260	my art or, like, my tweet, I get embarrassed
10507260	10508700	and I get butterflies in blood.
10508700	10509900	I, like, run around my room and jump.
10510460	10511020	Stop!
10511020	10512060	That's so cute!
10513500	10514140	Oh, my God.
10515500	10518860	God, I want Stony to just grab me and drag me
10518860	10521900	while I hyperventilate and grab for the furniture
10521900	10524460	and walls while she takes me into a small dark room
10524460	10528300	and all that is heard is muffled moans and wallbangs?
10531900	10534940	Reeflyn, you have a very specific intro, don't you?
10535580	10536700	We're on to you.
10536700	10538620	You have a very specific intro.
10539660	10540300	Yeah, no.
10541900	10542300	Mmm.
10543020	10543520	Mmm.
10544140	10545820	Mummy, I love when you read my marrows.
10545820	10546780	I sent all of them.
10546780	10548860	Am I getting one reflinged here?
10549980	10550460	Mmm.
10552300	10553420	Hey, Stony.
10553420	10554620	Hi, Reeflyn.
10554620	10556380	Today, I went to Costco.
10556380	10557740	It may not seem like a huge deal,
10557740	10559900	but I normally get really anxious when going there
10559900	10560620	and it's busy.
10561420	10562700	Ah, I hate when it's busy as well.
10562700	10564380	There's always a lot of people and I get overwhelmed,
10564380	10566700	however, after I talked to you, even the little bit
10566700	10568220	that I did, I was able to keep it together
10568220	10570060	and not have to leave early this time.
10570060	10571900	I thought back to how nervous I was talking to you,
10571900	10574220	but how worth it it was to say I love you and it helped me.
10574220	10575260	And thank you so much.
10575260	10576300	Oh, Reeflyn!
10576300	10577100	What the fuck?
10577100	10578060	That's amazing.
10579260	10581340	I'm glad you got your little cost...
10581340	10582940	Oh, Costco!
10582940	10584700	Wait, Costco's a supermarket.
10585340	10586460	That's so good.
10586460	10587660	Love you too, little Reeflyn.
10587660	10588700	I'm so glad.
10589900	10591900	See, it was in you all along though.
10591900	10594940	You have to celebrate your victories.
10594940	10595740	And that wasn't me.
10595740	10597020	I wasn't in the shop way.
10597020	10597660	That was you.
10597660	10598220	You did that.
10598220	10599500	You were doing fantastic.
10599740	10602220	And that was you.
10602220	10603580	I cannot read that fast.
10603580	10604060	I saw that.
10604060	10605100	I cannot read that fast.
10605100	10606380	That was like a fucking essay and a half
10606380	10607340	in the corner of my eye.
10607340	10608620	I cannot read that fast.
10608620	10610540	We're a figment of strong ease of imagination.
10610540	10611260	You better not be.
10611260	10612940	Either I'm going to be pregnant next month or not.
10614780	10616060	Take responsibility.
10616780	10617260	All right.
10618220	10620860	If you're not rapping it, take responsibility.
10622300	10623100	Meeting me pre...
10623100	10623660	Six!
10623660	10625180	I was pregnant with five.
10625180	10626140	Now I'm pregnant with six.
10626140	10627900	I can't read that fast either when I'm talking.
10628780	10631500	I fantasise about not being each other aggressively
10631500	10632940	while we exercise.
10632940	10635260	One, two, three, four.
10635900	10637980	That's basically if we're working out.
10637980	10639420	That's how it's going to sound for me.
10639420	10641740	Remember buying stuff in Costco during the pandemic?
10643660	10646220	Have to pay child support through working on the farm.
10646220	10647020	Yeah, working.
10647740	10648380	Working.
10648380	10651180	I'm sure we'll be harvesting anything from you on the farm.
10653340	10655420	Everyone help for sins, mum and gen two.
10656460	10656860	Yes.
10658140	10660540	If we keep apologising, do we get grape time?
10660540	10660940	Oh no.
10668860	10670140	Nice zorks, yeah.
10670940	10672540	You're like the mental asylum.
10673660	10675500	That's the replete Alice Madness return.
10678140	10680060	This would be the first time I actually would.
10680060	10681180	So hesitation.
10681180	10683980	Can we have a shotgun wedding after a prequel?
10684780	10686460	Oh my god, do you want to do that?
10686540	10687340	A little wedding rules.
10688780	10690220	I need to figure out how to use both.
10690780	10695420	Both is how people have like outfits that their head is like a head is still on it.
10696940	10698860	I don't know how to put a wedding dress on me.
10699580	10702220	It's going to have to be wed and dress PNG.
10702220	10702700	I'm sorry.
10704700	10707180	We're going to have to consummate the marriage as well.
10707180	10707820	Just so you know.
10709020	10711180	Just so you know, we're going to have to consummate the marriage on that
10711180	10712620	after the ASMR wedding.
10712620	10712940	So.
10713500	10718300	Mom, I tend to lurk for weeks because feeling comfortable commenting and live chats.
10718300	10721340	Some communities can put you all for hostile but your community is so friendly,
10721340	10722540	so comfortable typing stuff.
10722540	10724060	Oh, I'm so glad.
10724860	10726060	We've still got stinkings.
10726060	10726940	She knows right?
10726940	10728300	She can teach you.
10728300	10729660	I don't want to be a bother.
10732940	10735100	Shotgun wedding, hopefully, since one is hell.
10735100	10735900	Yee-haw!
10736780	10738140	That would murder me in real life.
10738140	10738700	Worth it.
10739900	10741500	We should get married before gen three.
10742140	10744460	So when we consummate your prego with gen three?
10745100	10746060	I don't know.
10746060	10746700	Oh wait, no.
10746700	10747900	Because that's speedrunning.
10747900	10748300	No.
10748300	10749420	I need a not...
10749420	10750140	Bruh.
10750140	10750460	This...
10750460	10752620	The tank needs to be empty, okay?
10752620	10754140	Morning, Scottish mummies.
10754140	10755340	Good morning, this one.
10758060	10759420	Thank you for the stream today.
10759420	10760300	Did you enjoy it?
10760300	10761580	Even though it's just me going...
10762220	10764540	Oh, I was supposed to wrap up like 30 minutes ago.
10764540	10765020	I'm weak.
10766940	10767500	Hi, mummet.
10767500	10769100	I don't know how much to say except a miss.
10769100	10769820	Oh, I love you.
10769820	10770300	Many kisses.
10770300	10770700	Many kisses.
10776220	10776940	Hey, mummet.
10777580	10781100	Your streams have been quite some freedom for me.
10781100	10782300	Freedom, you say?
10782300	10783580	For the Scottish VTuber?
10784700	10786540	It's a given around these parts.
10787100	10789260	Big Willy Wallace didn't die for nothing.
10789820	10792220	Freedom around for the Scottish VTuber.
10793100	10796460	I have quite the perverse mind, isn't it?
10796460	10798860	But I've been flamed by VTubers and communities before.
10799420	10803740	And I kind of ganged up with hate mail because of it.
10803740	10804540	Somewhere bad.
10805580	10808540	So your streams have been quite enjoyment for me and for Incan
10808540	10810540	and just having fun and positivity in my brain.
10810540	10811340	Thank you for being here.
10812380	10814060	Thank you for being here.
10814060	10818220	I hope in the future I get a girlfriend who has your mindset and personality.
10818220	10818940	I assure you.
10820220	10821100	I ain't the only one...
10822060	10823900	I'm not the only one built like this.
10823900	10827660	You need autism, ADHD and an accent.
10827660	10828140	And there you go.
10828140	10828700	Boom.
10829180	10829980	And that's it.
10829980	10830620	That's all you need.
10830620	10834220	So a little bit of microplastics on the brain to cause the autism
10835420	10838540	and the ADHD and the rest is good to go.
10840220	10841580	Good to go.
10842140	10842540	Okay.
10844540	10848140	Wedding is part of the doughnathon right before the first blue site stream.
10848780	10850380	Oh, hold on a minute.
10854540	10857420	Wedding is part of the doughnathon and then consummation.
10858700	10859200	Hmm.
10860060	10860560	Hmm.
10861660	10862700	Hmm.
10862700	10864380	Now we're playing 4D chess.
10866460	10867500	I'm playing checkers.
10867500	10870220	You're playing chess right now cause hmm.
10870220	10871420	No, hold on.
10871420	10872380	Let that man speak.
10872380	10873260	Let that man speak.
10874620	10877260	The first blue site could be the honeymoon.
10877260	10880140	I think that would actually be very nice.
10880140	10881660	I'm not sure about you.
10881660	10884380	Mummy, when you read my marshmallow just hid better in my phone.
10885340	10886380	Are you cheesing?
10887340	10890380	I don't have a fetish but your feet and socks are cute.
10890380	10891020	Thank you.
10891020	10892620	I got them from the mental fund.
10893580	10894860	Mummy, can I ink today?
10896060	10896940	Are you being denied?
10896940	10897660	Are you trying to skip?
10899100	10899600	Hmm.
10900540	10901340	From a lurker.
10901340	10901820	I love you.
10901820	10903660	I love you too, little lurkerling.
10903660	10904620	You're so cute.
10906300	10910860	Do you smell what the rooflings are cooking?
10912140	10912940	Sounds really cute.
10913660	10914860	Hmm.
10914860	10915420	Hi, Strony.
10915420	10917740	Sometimes I pitch a tent when you do those fake tears in them.
10918460	10919260	What are you talking about?
10919260	10920060	I'm just stretching.
10922060	10922560	Ah.
10923500	10924540	Ah.
10924540	10925420	Just stretching.
10927260	10927760	Yep.
10933260	10933900	Nice hooves.
10933900	10935180	Yeah, you like that.
10935180	10937180	No.
10941180	10942540	Your marshmallows go eh.
10943020	10944620	I'm at four minutes ago.
10944620	10945820	This is a double sentence.
10945820	10947820	I don't know if I got caught if you did then ignore.
10947820	10948700	Thank you for everything.
10951020	10952300	Even though I have Enrily friends,
10952300	10953980	I don't have much in common with them.
10953980	10954780	Oh my God, I felt that.
10955420	10960220	So I still feel a bit lonely not to mention that I'm 26.
10960220	10961740	And oh, Jesus.
10961740	10963500	I have yet to have a girlfriend.
10963500	10966300	Veiler has been a massive help for my mental state.
10966300	10966860	I didn't really...
10968380	10969900	Wait a minute, you have cherries, don't you?
10970620	10973820	I didn't really watch streamers before,
10973820	10975340	but the girls are giving me nothing but joy.
10975340	10977580	And it's not just the girls.
10977580	10979260	Sorry, I'm reading a lot of English here.
10979260	10981580	Being a part of the community of like-minded,
10981580	10985260	independent jewels have finally given me a sense of belonging,
10985260	10986540	especially during the Overwatch stream.
10986540	10989580	Dropping around with you, chat, and the other guys in the lobby
10989580	10991420	has made me the happiest I've been in quite a while.
10991420	10992620	So again, I can't thank you enough.
10992620	10993740	Honestly, I'm saddened a little bit.
10993740	10995100	I'll never be able to repay you.
10995100	10996940	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
10997820	10999100	You don't understand.
10999100	11002060	I will never be able to repay...
11002060	11003580	Wait, 26 is that what you said?
11003580	11004860	Oh, I'm sorry.
11004860	11005660	I'm sorry.
11007020	11007980	No, I don't...
11007980	11009900	Aren't most reeflings 30 plus?
11009900	11010700	Oh, he is!
11010700	11011660	Oh, that's kind of hot.
11014540	11017420	You're over 30 and you're letting me control your ink.
11018540	11019340	Oh, that's hot.
11024620	11026700	You're letting me be in control.
11027020	11029500	Oh, my God.
11032220	11034060	Oh, my God.
11034060	11035980	You're letting little old me,
11037020	11039340	a little five foot three tiny,
11039340	11042220	wainy little Spironee control your ink.
11044140	11044700	Shocking.
11046140	11046780	I'm 40.
11046780	11048060	What does that mean?
11048060	11049580	You have bloody good taste.
11050220	11051180	Oh, my God.
11051180	11051980	That's so good.
11052940	11055500	She didn't know a big part is 30 plus.
11055500	11056300	I guess not.
11057100	11059580	32, 28, 20.
11061180	11062540	Plenty of cherries on you.
11064940	11066860	I could smell the cherries on you.
11067900	11069740	I just turned 25 though.
11069740	11070300	Okay.
11070300	11071820	Because you're idly gonna...
11071820	11073820	Because you're idly this when I tell you my age.
11074940	11076860	We need to do a reefling demographic.
11077980	11079100	Where are my other...
11079100	11080460	I'm 23.
11080460	11081500	Where am I 24?
11083020	11084380	I can smell you.
11085340	11087580	How old do you think the youngest person here is?
11087580	11087980	18.
11089340	11092620	No one else under is allowed to watch our advice system.
11093340	11094140	We do not accept.
11095420	11096460	36.
11097500	11098620	The little spike ball.
11099500	11100540	Goddamn.
11101660	11103260	The real chair, boyhunter.
11104140	11104700	Pull it.
11105660	11105980	What?
11105980	11107100	Like the average...
11107100	11107580	Hold on.
11107580	11108620	Wait, I can't do a pull.
11109660	11110220	Oh, my God.
11110220	11112220	I'm supposed to be working right now,
11112220	11113820	but I like talking to you too much.
11115020	11116140	Age range.
11117980	11119100	Okay, add option.
11119100	11121180	Let's do 18 to...
11123180	11123900	24.
11125580	11127660	25 to 30.
11128460	11131900	31 to 35.
11132780	11134620	And then 36 plus.
11134620	11135900	And then true will do some.
11139580	11141820	That's probably not how I was supposed to do it,
11141820	11142940	but this is anonymous.
11143020	11144940	Like, it's not a thing that you sell out.
11144940	11145580	Do you see it?
11149660	11150780	Wait, did I do it wrong?
11150780	11152940	Are there any other reasons that are also from someone?
11152940	11154540	36 plus dang.
11154540	11155980	Real OG-san.
11155980	11157020	True OG-san.
11157020	11158540	Get their category.
11158540	11160940	I mean, fucking look at me though.
11160940	11163260	Like, I'm not being weird or funny,
11163260	11165420	but like, I'm not being funny.
11166300	11168700	Gomenasori, if you don't like seeing,
11168700	11172860	you're letting me control your anger.
11173100	11173740	Look at me.
11175260	11177420	Do you understand how hot that is?
11177420	11178140	I mean, shit.
11178780	11181660	This is the size of a Pokemon card in my hand.
11182460	11185100	And you're letting me control you?
11185100	11187100	Come on, that's fucking hot.
11187100	11188780	I don't care what anyone says.
11188780	11190140	I don't care what anyone says.
11191660	11192540	That is...
11193900	11195180	That's each word.
11195180	11196300	I don't care what anyone says.
11196860	11198140	I mean, look at me.
11198140	11199180	I write a bake.
11199180	11200380	Like, fuck, and you're letting me...
11201340	11202780	I'm a cyclist.
11202780	11205660	I'm the lowest of the lowest scum, okay?
11209500	11210620	You knew that?
11210620	11210940	Okay.
11212380	11213260	What can I say?
11213260	11214060	I like your stat.
11214060	11216220	I like your funny words, Scottish lady.
11217100	11219100	Your hands are like half as big as mine.
11219100	11220540	This is very plausible.
11220540	11223420	Apparently I have very tiny hands in comparison to you guys, so...
11225980	11227420	Oh my god, it says my name,
11227420	11229900	my blood type, and social security after voting.
11230540	11232220	I'm coming to your house now, got ya.
11234140	11234700	Okay.
11234700	11235660	Nah, you guys are...
11235660	11238380	Yeah, you guys are getting my ages.
11238380	11239420	She's a cyclist.
11239420	11242540	Waterboard her with McDonald's spray, real.
11242540	11245100	We just love you, Momela, you too, you son.
11246300	11247020	Keep going on.
11247020	11248460	Like, a bake cyclist?
11248460	11252940	I cycle all the time, shoulder to shoulder, with semis.
11254620	11256620	You've got a semi, you say?
11256620	11259180	Sorry, you're being very serious with that sentence.
11259580	11263980	I cycle on the pavements, which actually is illegal,
11263980	11265580	because I could hit a pedestrian,
11265580	11267980	but I don't want to go on the road,
11267980	11269900	because I don't want to get ran over by a car team.
11273980	11277740	Yeah, I'm a 36-year-old man who owns the house and has a job,
11277740	11279020	and I'm on the other side of the road.
11279020	11280620	Please control my ink, it's all for you.
11280620	11281420	Fuck!
11281980	11283180	That's crazy!
11285100	11286060	But in a good way.
11286700	11287500	No one did.
11289740	11290380	Mmm.
11290380	11292140	Hello, I'm the 26-year-old reflin.
11293260	11296460	Yes, I still have every single chair you want it.
11296460	11297260	Please!
11297260	11299740	Oh my god, I need to do a fucking meta roleplay right now.
11299740	11301900	You can't bike on the sidewalk on the pavement,
11301900	11304300	like, where people walk, isn't it not?
11304300	11305660	In Scotland, it's illegal,
11305660	11307500	but the police never told me off for it.
11307500	11309260	Like, the police used to see me a lot.
11309260	11310780	Oh my fucking god.
11310780	11315180	I used to see the same fucking egg to Polish men,
11315180	11316620	like, day in, day out,
11317420	11318620	and they'd always look at me,
11318620	11319420	and I'd always be like,
11319420	11320860	oh, you fuck, they're gonna say something,
11320860	11323100	because it's like, you're not supposed to be on the pavement,
11323100	11325340	or you'll get, like, because you can hurt someone.
11325980	11327500	Evos, thank you for becoming a member.
11327500	11329020	Please enjoy the emotes,
11329020	11330140	and thank you for the support.
11330140	11331340	Sorry, it's a bit fluff on my leg.
11333020	11337420	But I look very visually quite young in real life,
11337420	11338860	like, not on camera or whatever.
11340220	11341740	Visually, I look quite young,
11341740	11344220	and I think that's why the police never said nothing to me,
11344220	11345260	because they were always like,
11345260	11347020	oh, she's like a teenager,
11347020	11349260	she's like still at high school and that kind of thing.
11350060	11352060	To polis, the polis.
11352060	11354460	Polis men, policemen, polis.
11355180	11356060	A Shawnee gremlin.
11356780	11358460	They have home, two cars,
11358460	11359340	and live across the world.
11359340	11360700	I always let you control my anger.
11360700	11361500	Damn!
11363260	11365740	I'm not sure how much you're controlling for the priority.
11367180	11367900	Polis.
11367900	11370140	All right, and so it's not a police in Scotland,
11370140	11371660	it's the polis that are at the door,
11371660	11373020	like, oh, the polis out here.
11374060	11374940	You didn't really get,
11375660	11377180	it's quite common to get, like,
11377180	11378780	randomly spanked by the police,
11378780	11379820	so don't be too worried
11379820	11381500	as opposed to show up at your door.
11382620	11383740	I'm out of cherries.
11383740	11384860	Oh, no, no, no, no.
11384860	11386380	On the contrary, Riflin,
11386380	11388540	I'm sure I can spawn in a few more for you.
11390460	11394140	I'm sure there's a few first times I can have with you.
11394140	11395820	I'm sure, but don't you worry.
11395820	11396460	Don't you worry.
11398060	11399260	I thought you said polis, no.
11399260	11400300	Not polska.
11400300	11401660	Nie, nie polska.
11402460	11403580	Pokaż syski?
11404540	11405420	Is that why I'm not?
11406380	11407420	No polska today.
11408700	11409660	Hi, Mummy.
11409660	11411580	De-nailing here?
11413900	11415580	Oh, denial-ing here?
11415580	11417100	I edged too much.
11418460	11419980	And opted to ruin it.
11419980	11421420	Your audience is too hot and awful.
11423660	11424460	Oh, my God.
11424460	11424780	What?
11424780	11425340	How many?
11425340	11426220	Well, how long was your...
11426220	11426940	Oh, we need to deal.
11426940	11428940	I'll deal with, I'll deal with you
11428940	11430140	in the membership stream.
11430300	11431260	Thank you very much.
11432700	11434860	Can we pull a new audio for Patreon?
11434860	11436460	Um, there's a membership stream
11436460	11437420	that we're writing this week
11437420	11438700	for what you want,
11438700	11440460	but in November,
11440460	11442220	all Patreon contents
11442780	11444380	becomes what you guys
11444380	11445420	want me to write with you.
11447340	11448860	32 owns a house and a job,
11448860	11450460	and you stream the moment I go off work.
11450460	11452060	So having someone control me
11452060	11453020	after a tiny day
11453020	11454700	is an extraordinary feeling.
11454700	11456140	Oh, does it give you relief?
11456140	11457740	But in more ways than one.
11457900	11461820	Anyone want to buy Pokemon?
11461820	11463420	Collector's binder?
11464460	11466540	We got scum as with our binder, okay?
11467660	11468700	Yeah, we got scum as.
11469580	11470380	So many.
11470380	11471660	Sorry if this is a repeater
11471660	11472300	I got eaten.
11472300	11473820	Here's my gripper video.
11473820	11474460	Are you...
11474460	11477340	You sent a video of your feet moving?
11478060	11480380	As opposed to not moving.
11481340	11482380	Oh, my gosh.
11482380	11484460	I'm about to see your freaking feet on my...
11484460	11485820	I swear if you are...
11486780	11488620	And I open up this marshmallow.
11488620	11490540	I'm not opening up marshmallows on stream again.
11493180	11494300	Are you talking?
11494300	11495820	No, he's just moving his feet.
11495820	11497500	You're in your boxers!
11498220	11499980	Okay, I didn't see a pizza.
11499980	11501740	Wait, his feet are so pale.
11501740	11502860	What the fuck?
11502860	11503980	Why are they so pale?
11503980	11504940	Why are you white?
11506540	11508060	Okay, I think he's in his boxers.
11508060	11509580	Wait, who's in their boxers?
11509580	11510300	Hold on a minute.
11510300	11511900	Are you all in your boxers right now?
11512540	11513740	Hold on a minute.
11514700	11515980	Wait a minute.
11517740	11518620	Wait a minute.
11520940	11521260	Who?
11522380	11524540	Who's not wearing anything right now?
11525660	11527100	She knows?
11527100	11528540	I mean, it's easier access.
11534220	11535820	Oh, you guys are wearing underwear.
11536540	11536940	Nope.
11536940	11538140	I'm in me joggers.
11538940	11539740	Broom, broom.
11540780	11542140	It's hot in here, okay?
11542140	11543500	I'm in bed, so yeah, boxers.
11544700	11545500	I'm wearing shorts.
11545500	11546380	The socks count.
11546380	11547580	You're only wearing socks?
11547580	11548940	They don't look cold.
11548940	11550540	I'm at work, fully clothed.
11550540	11551660	Oh, are you at work?
11552300	11553100	Ink yourself.
11553100	11553420	No!
11554620	11555980	No, don't, don't, don't, don't.
11555980	11556540	You're at work.
11557900	11559180	Pants to check.
11559180	11559820	I'm a grown man.
11559820	11561180	Why would I wear clothes on my own house?
11561180	11562380	Real, real through.
11562940	11564060	I don't have shit to do.
11564060	11564700	So hot.
11564700	11566220	Mmm, grab it up.
11566220	11567180	Power word.
11567180	11567580	Ink.
11568380	11570860	Easier to keep the jewels at a proper temperature.
11571820	11573180	Alone and naked.
11575180	11577100	I'm always on the commando grind.
11577100	11580220	Oh, you got the commando weapon on black ops?
11580220	11580700	Real.
11582700	11583180	Um.
11587420	11588380	Mmm.
11588380	11590060	Mummy, I'm nervous to say my age in chat,
11590060	11592060	although other reasons have said theirs.
11592060	11595100	But I'm 20 and yes, I'm letting you control my ink in America.
11595100	11596620	Oh, you're letting an older woman.
11597180	11598060	Call me a cougar.
11599020	11601260	An older woman?
11602140	11603260	Control your ink?
11606700	11610140	I'm walking in public so sadly, I'm modestly just terrible.
11610140	11612220	Caught me off guard, I'm wearing five pairs of pants.
11612220	11612700	Got you!
11613260	11614380	Got you in 4k.
11614380	11615660	A onesie for real, for real.
11616620	11618140	I've sucked on, does that count?
11618140	11618620	Something.
11619340	11620780	You spilled water on that bed.
11621660	11622140	Bed?
11622780	11623580	Who's bed?
11623580	11624380	Who's bed?
11625260	11626540	This is called floor.
11627500	11628220	No bed here.
11632220	11633580	Below 20 and 30.
11633580	11635260	We're closing in on that real age boys.
11635260	11635660	Ooh.
11638140	11640220	Please do the foot cam script writing stream.
11640220	11643180	I have a major fantasy of being used as a chair and a foot sill.
11643180	11643420	Oh.
11648060	11649260	So that's your thing.
11649260	11650860	That's your special interest.
11650860	11652220	Oh, and you ignore me.
11652220	11654620	Just playing with that ball as you were yapping was killing me.
11654620	11656060	I'm sure the other refunds would enjoy it too.
11656060	11656620	Thank you, mommy.
11656620	11657500	You're too good.
11657500	11660380	Also CB, cognitive behavioural therapy is not punishment.
11661740	11662300	Kinkling.
11662300	11664060	More like you've got a name upgrade.
11664060	11664940	You're called kinkling.
11666140	11666780	Furnit year?
11666780	11667740	You want to be furnit year?
11671180	11672700	No bed, no hands for hanging.
11672700	11673580	Life is a lie.
11673580	11675500	What, you wanted my bed for the next one?
11676860	11680700	I mean, if you want, I can bring a mattress through for the next hand cam stream.
11680700	11681580	I don't see why not.
11682380	11683900	I don't see why not.
11683900	11685820	I can bring a mattress in if you want it.
11685820	11686620	Like, sure.
11686620	11687740	That's all you have to say.
11689020	11689820	Do it.
11689820	11691020	Treat me like an object.
11691020	11691820	Fuck no.
11691820	11693500	That's just vanilla stuff.
11694380	11695500	I'm kink-shing.
11697980	11699260	Older women are extremely hot.
11699260	11701820	I'd assume it's the same for women when older men are hot.
11703340	11704540	See, I go both ways.
11704540	11705660	I'm like fucking everything.
11705660	11706460	Gimme it all, please.
11708460	11709260	As a lurk.
11709420	11710380	As a lurk?
11711820	11712380	Hi, strongy.
11712380	11714460	All this lurker love is making me come out of the woodworks
11714460	11716380	and I'm a major lurker who doesn't even talk and chat.
11716380	11717580	Been lurking since debut.
11717580	11718060	Oh, hi.
11719260	11722540	We're almost at four months lurking on me from the shadows.
11722540	11723260	But I see.
11725420	11727020	And other girls, it's actually kind of bad
11727020	11729180	because whenever I become a member, I did it
11729180	11731420	when there was no stream, so you wouldn't read my name.
11731420	11735340	Oh, but that's like the best part about like becoming a member
11735340	11737420	because I'm not allowed to say your names in general.
11737420	11738540	Because that's feature, but there,
11738540	11740220	that's one of the unwritten VTuber rules,
11740220	11743740	to wrap around back to the singing.
11744780	11746220	That's like an unwritten VTuber rule.
11746220	11748780	I don't say your names in general, like I could,
11748780	11751100	but I don't because it's not possible.
11751100	11754860	But when you tip or become a member or stream snipe,
11754860	11756780	then that gives you the choice.
11756780	11759420	Although I feel a bit rough about the stream snipe one
11759420	11761180	because obviously for those who like to lurk,
11761180	11763740	I'm worried that you feel left out
11763740	11765580	because you don't want to show up on stream
11765580	11767260	because you're self-conscious.
11767260	11770620	But I'm hoping I can extract not only ink out of you
11770620	11771820	but some confidence as well.
11771820	11773500	So it would work out in the long run, you know?
11775020	11778300	Momay, a birth ASMR that ends in the reveal of Jenta next year.
11779580	11781180	I have no idea.
11781180	11782300	Like a real ninja.
11782300	11783020	That's okay.
11783900	11785740	I never like when VTuber say my name.
11785740	11786060	Why?
11786940	11788460	Beat for free just like that.
11788460	11791260	You're gonna love my monetization stream.
11792380	11792700	Sir?
11793660	11793980	Sir?
11794700	11796700	There's a monetization stream
11796780	11798700	with your name written on it on this channel.
11798700	11799420	If you like VT.
11800860	11802780	Isn't that just for money purposes?
11802780	11805420	Like your only one worth can call your name if you pay me?
11806940	11807420	No.
11807420	11809660	Like if I start to try and say everyone's...
11809660	11811820	So I used to do this thing where I say good morning,
11811820	11813500	try and say everyone's name at roll call,
11813500	11815260	but it's not possible.
11815260	11817580	So I can only say it during the...
11817580	11819980	It's not like fuck you pay me, I'll say your name.
11819980	11824460	It's just like brain worms and all those issues that come up.
11824460	11825900	Fin don't fuck off!
11825900	11826220	No!
11827660	11828380	Nope!
11828380	11828940	I'm...
11828940	11829420	Nope.
11829420	11830540	We're not doing that.
11830540	11831500	We're not doing that.
11831500	11832300	You're done.
11832300	11832940	You're done.
11833740	11834620	You're done.
11835660	11836300	You're done.
11836300	11836940	We're not...
11836940	11839660	We're not even touching that subject of our time football.
11839660	11842300	Mummy, what are your any opinions about armpits?
11842940	11845660	I think you should take a big inhale of mine,
11845660	11847900	memorize the sin and ink.
11847900	11849260	That's why I think about armpits.
11849420	11857500	It would cause brain worms if someone doesn't get their name called out when they're doing a roll.
11857500	11859420	Yeah, like I don't want brain worms either.
11860220	11860940	Don't shoot me!
11860940	11862060	I'm just a messenger!
11862060	11862620	Reeflings!
11862620	11864540	Twist that man's nipples right now.
11864540	11866060	Getting up on that reefling right now.
11866060	11866940	Show them...
11866940	11868780	Show them what a real twisty is all about.
11870300	11872060	Hi mummy, I'm also a denialing right now.
11872060	11873660	Can I ask for some words of encouragement?
11873660	11874940	I have until Saturday.
11874940	11875980	When's Saturday?
11875980	11878460	I'm on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
11878540	11879180	What's that one?
11879180	11881420	Two, three, four, five.
11881420	11882700	Five more days, damn.
11884380	11885740	Sucks the suck, damnit.
11887500	11889420	Sucks the fucking suck.
11891900	11894780	Watch Thephilipod dom here?
11894780	11895660	I don't know, what would it...
11896300	11898300	It's healthy to lose gums with ink every stream.
11898940	11900300	I hope you find it.
11900300	11902540	Thank you, Gura, for that hit joke.
11902540	11903660	Yes, I will steal that.
11906140	11907660	Denialing, what would you say to that?
11907660	11908700	To encourage you?
11909740	11910860	Don't think about it.
11911660	11913180	But if you do think about it,
11914300	11918380	make sure you think really deep and hard about it.
11919180	11925420	Almost keep ramming the point over and over and over again in your head.
11930860	11932700	Where did my desktop audio display?
11932700	11934140	Something pleaded my desktop audio.
11934140	11934940	I don't know what it was.
11935740	11938060	Is someone streaming in the background?
11945660	11947660	Hi, mommie, I'm usually too tired to send in texts.
11947660	11948220	No, you don't have to.
11948220	11950460	But whenever you make content specifically for yourself,
11950460	11951740	I do like to send you something in return.
11951740	11953580	So don't worry if it seems like you don't want to send stuff.
11953580	11955340	I think most of us just wait for material.
11955340	11955900	That's fair.
11955900	11956540	No, that's true.
11956540	11957180	No, that's true.
11957180	11957740	That's true.
11957740	11958540	That's definitely true.
11958540	11961180	I've been just lacking and lacking, unfortunately.
11961420	11966780	And that's like I fucked up when I made my Roblox account.
11966780	11968220	Literally have my first surname.
11969100	11973660	Yeah, definitely don't stream snipe if your legal name is on your social media.
11974380	11976620	That goes for anyone else listening out there.
11976620	11979340	Turn your name into 360 no scope now.
11979340	11982860	Do not use your legal name on any stuff.
11984460	11985580	Moment please.
11985580	11986460	These songs are good.
11986460	11987580	Hey, mommie, I need to go pee.
11987580	11988940	Can you pause the game?
11991660	11993820	I can't remember the VTuber's response to that.
11993820	11995260	I think that's a VTuber's name.
11996060	11996940	It's too late.
11997660	11998460	It's too late.
12000380	12003500	Just don't need the new honey you bought, you know.
12003500	12006220	Can we do an ASMR stream where we send our names on Maro and VTuber?
12007180	12009740	I did think about that for the Pokemon stream.
12011100	12014140	I was trying to take the feedback I got from the drawing stream,
12014140	12016860	the membership drawing one, where I gave him the gamer tag and stuff,
12016860	12019180	but people didn't like it, so I'm a bit hesitant.
12019580	12024700	Considering how you are advertised, I almost feel bad.
12024700	12025420	I haven't inked to me.
12025420	12026380	I just watched your streams.
12027500	12029500	You've never inked to me once?
12030140	12031260	Is it my accent?
12035100	12038060	There's not one thing that's made you want to ink.
12040060	12041740	I'm clearly failing my job.
12043260	12045820	I'm clearly a failure as a succubus.
12046780	12047980	No one?
12047980	12050380	You gave mummy brain worms, literally.
12050380	12051260	No one?
12051260	12054060	I've not said one thing that's tickled your pickle pink
12054780	12056700	until you stroke that shit raw.
12057660	12060380	Until you couldn't feel your thighs anymore?
12060380	12062460	What a failure of a fucking streamer I am.
12062460	12062940	Goddamn.
12063980	12064620	Sacrilege.
12065980	12068460	Mummy needs your ink to survive.
12068460	12069260	Girl, failure.
12069260	12070140	I can't believe it.
12070140	12070620	A face.
12072060	12073340	He's just a holy knight.
12073340	12074860	Don't take it personally.
12076540	12077180	Goddamn.
12078860	12080060	I'm the girl failure.
12080060	12082860	I can't even live up to those fucking expectations.
12082860	12083180	Shit.
12087260	12088060	Shocking.
12088060	12088380	Chong.
12089180	12091740	If that made you mad, you're not gonna like what I have to say.
12092460	12093420	No!
12093420	12094300	Wait, really?
12098540	12098860	Ah.
12099660	12100780	Don't take it to heart.
12101340	12106860	That fucking teasing game, that shit, the fuck?
12111180	12111900	Oh, you can't do that.
12112940	12113900	That's okay.
12113900	12116460	Um, there's a time and a place for that.
12116460	12116860	There it is.
12117900	12119100	I know what it is.
12119100	12121180	It's cause I'm not cute and funny, isn't it?
12122220	12123820	It's cause I'm not cute and funny.
12125020	12126300	You know what I think about that?
12126380	12139500	You don't have to be scared, I want this, please, for me.
12140540	12141020	That's it.
12141020	12142700	It's cause you want cute and funny, but I'm down here.
12142700	12144380	I'm all the way down here with my octaves.
12144940	12147180	I'm chilling down here with my octaves, all right?
12148780	12150620	Leave me and my deep voice alone.
12150620	12151980	I know you like the cute and funny.
12151980	12152540	I'm on to you.
12152540	12152940	Which one?
12152940	12154300	I don't think I've been again.
12154300	12155020	No, I'm on to you.
12157020	12160860	I sadly, I can't ink to you most of the time because of anti-depressants.
12160860	12161980	Oh, no, keep doing that.
12161980	12162460	Hold it.
12162460	12166700	All memes aside, all memes aside, all memes aside.
12167660	12171180	Do not stop taking, cause the thing about anti-depressants is
12171180	12173020	they take so long to build up in your system
12173020	12175900	if you stop taking them purely for the purpose of inking.
12177340	12178220	No, thank you.
12179820	12180940	Lollipops running.
12182140	12182860	Cunning cull.
12184060	12184620	Okay.
12184620	12185260	Hi, Yumi.
12185260	12185740	How's it going?
12187180	12187980	Cunning cull.
12189740	12190380	Fuck.
12190380	12191100	That's kind of good.
12192460	12193980	You like the dummy mommy voice?
12193980	12194300	What?
12194300	12196700	You mean you don't like the Ash Ketchum voice?
12198140	12198620	Ash.
12199980	12201420	I'm Ash Ketchum.
12201420	12203260	What do you mean you don't like my voice?
12204540	12206140	Um, you got class then?
12206140	12207500	Oh my god, you're in education?
12207500	12208300	How young?
12208300	12209500	Are you over 18?
12209500	12211340	I don't call out for people that are under 18.
12214540	12215020	Are you an-
12215980	12216460	Okay.
12217260	12217900	Monka is.
12218780	12219900	Please enjoy your class.
12219900	12220380	Goddamn.
12221900	12223020	What's the name plus twi-
12223020	12224540	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
12224540	12225820	You had me stressed in there.
12225820	12227660	I was like, you fucking middle school?
12227660	12229580	Why are you talking to me?
12229580	12231020	Why are you making content?
12233180	12234300	Change her back.
12234300	12236460	I want that voice that sounds like she's telling me all.
12237660	12238460	Oh, this one.
12238460	12239020	Right, okay.
12239660	12240780	It's Ash Ketchum.
12240780	12241580	Holy smokes.
12242460	12243260	I don't know what-
12243420	12246140	I don't know what American ranking system is.
12246140	12249660	Is middle school not like when you're 12 or something?
12249660	12250540	I have no idea.
12251500	12252780	University is a thing?
12253820	12257980	Well, it could use me for being uneducated
12257980	12259900	and not understanding the basic age ranges
12259900	12261820	of those who go into further education.
12262940	12264140	It could be at university.
12264940	12266780	College students can be 18 or 19.
12266780	12269180	Funny to put her on her toes though.
12270140	12272780	Did you just make a pun?
12273660	12278460	I hear, I hear, I hear.
12278460	12280860	You me said she put me on my toes.
12282220	12283420	This is my perfect team.
12284460	12285980	I don't like the toes pointing at-
12285980	12287900	Well, you don't have dexterity in your toes?
12288780	12290620	Like, can you not move them around
12290620	12292140	and do what you want with them?
12292140	12293100	I didn't mean to.
12293100	12293660	Oh my God.
12293660	12294860	Well, it was bloody good either way.
12298620	12299500	Nicely said.
12299500	12300620	I don't mind Ash Ketchum.
12300620	12302300	I have specific things though.
12303180	12303660	What?
12303660	12305980	You'd prefer Jesse instead?
12307340	12309500	What's the wrong briefling?
12309500	12312460	You don't like when mommy sounds like a Pokemon character?
12313340	12314380	Oh dear.
12317580	12319260	How you like that, boys?
12320220	12321900	Strony's toes are very powerful.
12321900	12322780	Can you do James?
12323900	12324940	Me off this right-
12324940	12325580	Wait, James.
12326860	12329180	To protect the world from devastation.
12329180	12330060	I can't go that deep.
12331020	12332140	I can't go that deep.
12332140	12332780	Ma'am, please.
12332780	12333420	I'm in the kitchen.
12333420	12334540	Try and make dinner.
12334540	12335340	What's wrong?
12336060	12339260	Are you imagining me coming from behind you?
12339260	12339900	No.
12339900	12341420	Keep doing what you're doing.
12341420	12344620	I'm just going to stay behind you.
12344620	12346620	Press the real class in the kitchen.
12348220	12349900	James is higher than Jesse.
12349900	12350540	Wait, walk.
12351820	12353580	Protect the world from devastation.
12354460	12356700	To protect the world from devastation.
12358140	12359340	Me off this right?
12359340	12360780	Uh, I kind of fucking do.
12362780	12363740	Protect the world.
12364460	12365500	Protect the world.
12366540	12368780	Protect the world from devastation.
12368780	12369580	Wait, no.
12371740	12372940	James, how?
12372940	12373580	I'm okay.
12374620	12375740	Please, I'm trying to click in.
12375740	12377740	Can you go ara ara?
12377740	12381180	Ara ara, and then in Jesse's voice.
12381180	12382220	Ara ara.
12384140	12386860	Have you been a good boy, little briefling?
12387820	12393340	Have you been making sure that mommy has perfect access to you?
12397020	12401020	Did you know if you stick your feet out from the blanket,
12401020	12403180	mommy's going to visit to talk you in?
12405660	12408780	The trolling James voice is our register's more than this one.
12408780	12409740	This is kind of thing.
12411100	12412220	How do you do it Valley though?
12413980	12416380	Oh my god, are you me?
12416860	12419420	It's been so long.
12420620	12421340	That's the best.
12421340	12422220	I go up right here.
12425740	12427420	That triggered my swallow reflex.
12427420	12429180	I'm playing a game of women's chills.
12430140	12431020	Young world craft.
12432220	12433580	Woman mathematical stood up.
12433580	12436300	Up two, three forward, up two, three forward.
12437260	12438620	It's been way too long.
12438620	12443420	We should like honestly catch the fuck up like seriously.
12444060	12447580	What? Why are you calling me a bimbo?
12448380	12449420	What are you talking about?
12449420	12450860	What does that word even mean?
12451740	12453660	You're so funny, briefling.
12453660	12456380	I like when you give me that expression on your face
12456380	12457660	like you're pitying me.
12459500	12459980	I don't know.
12460780	12461740	That's a car.
12461740	12462220	Sorry.
12463100	12463740	I'm sorry.
12463740	12465980	I'm gonna imagine saying what?
12467820	12468700	No, I'm not a good boy.
12468700	12471980	In fact, I'm actually a bad boy that I became a woman.
12471980	12472540	What?
12472620	12473740	That's not every one.
12474460	12475900	Gayru voice on top.
12476940	12479260	Fifth, fifth gal in law.
12480060	12481260	Bimbos have big boobs.
12485340	12486300	I'm speechless.
12486300	12487740	I don't know what to say to that.
12487740	12491580	Um, you got me there.
12493260	12494380	You got me there.
12494380	12495660	I'm not gonna lie.
12495660	12496780	Fuck, I have no comeback.
12497500	12504540	Yeah, okay, I got to tip for that Jesse Aruara.
12504540	12505580	Pure gold.
12505580	12506380	I lost.
12506380	12507980	Oh, you liked it.
12507980	12508380	Thank you.
12510620	12511740	Literally I paused.
12511740	12513900	I was like, there's no recovery from that one.
12513900	12516940	Oh, I was like, oh, I can do this and this and this.
12516940	12519100	And I was like, well, actually the webcam's on right now.
12519100	12521420	If I go sideways, you're gonna see through me.
12521420	12523260	Um, so not as much as that happens.
12524220	12525500	Are you squinting me right now?
12525500	12526620	Mio's Oro Oro.
12527260	12529500	Strani is one of my favorite streamers.
12529500	12529900	Oh, yeah?
12529900	12532860	Thankfully, she doesn't know who I am since this is my out.
12533740	12535740	Gura Gura channel.in.
12535740	12536940	Okay, dude.
12536940	12538300	Thank you for the tip.
12539500	12541660	Gura, we love you, Gura.
12541660	12543100	I can't wait for your next thing.
12543740	12546060	I love your, your bucket, Callan.
12546060	12548780	Your gallon bucket of a comment.
12548780	12549580	That was really funny.
12549580	12550300	Peace.
12550300	12552860	I don't know how she can think on her feet like that.
12552860	12553340	Yeah.
12553340	12556380	I don't know how Gura could think so fast on her feet like that.
12556380	12558220	I don't get it because I'm just asking.
12559500	12562460	Um, I don't know how she did that, honestly.
12564060	12565420	I've lost gallons to you.
12566060	12567340	I've lost gallons to you.
12568060	12569260	I hope you can go find it.
12573580	12574300	Gura's real.
12575020	12575900	She's a real good book.
12576700	12578060	Why is that whenever I come at hand?
12578060	12579740	I'm streaming my feet.
12579740	12581260	Honestly, you got me there.
12581260	12582140	Wrap it up.
12582140	12582780	Wrap it up.
12582780	12583820	The reefling called me out.
12583820	12584860	No, he's got a point.
12584860	12585500	Nope.
12585500	12585980	Hold on.
12585980	12586540	Let him speak.
12586540	12587340	He's got a point.
12588460	12588780	Um,
12593980	12595180	they're trying not like bimbos.
12595180	12596380	No, I'm flat-chested.
12596380	12598380	You may, you may.
12598380	12600380	There's no other way to explain this.
12600380	12601260	I am Patan.
12602460	12606940	Um, I have the smallest as well of all my gen mates.
12606940	12608460	Um, I am flat-chested.
12609180	12613180	No more feet on hand count streams?
12617980	12619180	Why are you lying?
12619900	12620380	I mean,
12622460	12622860	I mean,
12632140	12633180	that's all you're getting.
12634220	12636140	Do you see head straight down this way?
12636140	12637340	There's nothing going on.
12639420	12641420	There's just little hills.
12642700	12644220	There's tiny little hills.
12644220	12645180	We're just chilling.
12646140	12647180	Chilling like a villain.
12647980	12649980	No, there's a little bit.
12651980	12652780	The hips coming.
12654620	12655420	A little bit.
12655420	12657100	I don't want to mess with the way I've come too much.
12657100	12658300	What time is it now?
12659660	12659980	Sorry.
12662620	12662860	Um,
12664060	12665340	Sheevee's boobs reattached.
12665340	12667740	Someone made a meme of Sheevee giving me her boobs
12667740	12669580	and I was like, who do you think ticked your boobs?
12669580	12670860	Stranny nose!
12674060	12675260	Are you squiddin' me right now?
12675260	12676860	Don't able to firmly grasp them.
12676860	12679660	Well, remember I do have a bra that's shaping them on,
12679660	12680380	by the way.
12680380	12681500	I have terrible news.
12681500	12684060	Thank you to Puckle Nation for the extended membership.
12685660	12686300	And the support.
12687020	12689420	I hope you enjoy your emotes.
12689420	12690460	They're soon coming.
12690460	12690940	20m.
12691980	12693340	Rip that shit off!
12693340	12693980	Free the boob.
12695580	12696940	I don't see any problems here.
12697820	12698300	Okay.
12699660	12700380	Don't say sorry.
12700380	12700940	I didn't mean it.
12700940	12701580	Oh, no, no, no.
12701580	12702300	Don't worry.
12702300	12703420	We're just teasing.
12703420	12703980	Don't worry.
12703980	12704620	I'm teasing.
12705340	12707660	I'm teasing for a please and please don't overthink.
12707660	12709980	When you talk to me, you're wearing a brate.
12709980	12711100	Blasphemous.
12711100	12711580	I know.
12711580	12712220	Well, that's true.
12712220	12714540	If you're wearing a hammock and you said you were wearing a,
12714540	12715500	your boxerino.
12715500	12716540	So you're wearing a hammock.
12718940	12719740	Hi, mommy's feet.
12720700	12722300	Hello, Riefling.
12722300	12723340	It's nice to see you.
12724380	12725900	I'm talking to you through my feet.
12726700	12727180	Ta-da.
12728060	12729740	Sorry, I'm an innocent asylum right now.
12730620	12733580	Due to the fact that you can see my under feet.
12734780	12736380	To support what breast.
12736380	12737500	Right, steady on.
12737500	12737900	Right.
12737900	12742780	If there was no mild support, they'd start sagging and shit.
12742780	12743420	I don't know.
12743420	12744540	I don't know how science works.
12748620	12752860	Would you say it's not fair that guys can show their bitboops and women?
12752860	12754780	Oh, I get scared of men.
12755740	12761180	Like, whenever I watch a movie or a TV show and then that guy takes his shirt off,
12761180	12763020	I'm like, oh, I'm like, oh, right.
12763020	12763260	Okay.
12763900	12767100	Cause like, cause you're not allowed to see him another way, you know.
12769100	12770780	It's not expecting the ball squish.
12770780	12771900	Oh, I'm just having a bit.
12771900	12774460	I'm not, I'm just, I'm stimming on the ball right now.
12774460	12775900	I'm stimming so hard on your ball.
12777900	12779420	What do you feel about tattoos?
12779420	12780460	Knock yourself out.
12780460	12782620	Unfortunately, my mom instilled in shala.
12782620	12783740	She's instilled in me.
12783740	12784780	Didn't have any tattoos.
12785500	12788620	And I'm allowed piercings where they're not, well, I'm allowed.
12788620	12790940	I am an adult now, but when I was growing up,
12790940	12793580	I had an interest in getting like a tongue piercing and stuff.
12795260	12798860	But she said, don't get piercings where people can see them.
12800860	12803420	And I took that literally and I got my angel wings.
12803420	12808460	Um, yeah.
12811580	12814300	The sad ball, my single ball.
12817260	12818620	She's still one of those strong.
12820140	12822300	Making me hungry and hatred.
12822300	12824460	I want a neck tattoo, but that would kill my job.
12824460	12826060	Yeah, I'm gonna have to.
12826060	12828140	I'm afraid the world hasn't quite evolved past.
12828140	12828620	Oh my God.
12828620	12828860	Inc.
12829500	12833020	Now as much as the angel wings, um, yeah.
12834140	12834940	You hold on.
12834940	12835500	Let me, uh,
12838380	12839580	approve just a minute.
12839580	12841180	And you know what this is?
12842620	12844060	This is an angel wing.
12845740	12846860	This was in me.
12846860	12848140	It's no longer in me.
12849020	12851100	It was stolen from me by a shower.
12853020	12856780	That used to be a part of me, but unfortunately that ship
12856780	12857180	has sailed.
12857180	12858540	And no, I'm not gonna re-pierced.
12859180	12860620	You just have it.
12860620	12862620	Yeah, it ripped out like a month ago.
12864300	12869260	I, it tore off out of me, like out of my personal body.
12869980	12870780	It went, wee.
12871820	12872780	It was painful.
12872780	12875660	Yes, before you ask, it was excruciatingly painful, but
12876700	12878860	will we take out the other for symmetry?
12878860	12881020	Oh, I'm keeping it for now.
12883020	12886460	Um, did the nip rip off?
12886460	12887500	It reattached.
12887500	12889980	Um, because of the blood flow around the area,
12889980	12891980	um, it healed incredibly quickly,
12891980	12894300	which I kind of suspect.
12894300	12897420	But I'm a one-winged angel,
12897420	12899500	so I can kind of fly just a little bit,
12899500	12900940	not too much, but I can fly a little bit.
12901980	12903100	And you should take the other one out,
12903100	12904860	so you don't rip that one as well.
12904860	12906540	But because I only have one now,
12906540	12909420	my brain registers that I got only have one,
12909420	12910460	and I need to be careful.
12912620	12916140	She almost had a gripper nipple on her body.
12916140	12917100	What does that mean?
12917820	12919020	Oh, like, okay.
12919980	12921900	Shawnee, you need me to kiss it better.
12921900	12922940	Mmm.
12922940	12924700	But yeah, it's fine, honestly, it's fine.
12926860	12927900	Sephora?
12928780	12929100	What?
12929900	12930860	Sephora?
12930860	12931500	Evil?
12932380	12934140	Wait, you've both made a reference to this.
12934140	12934780	What is this?
12935500	12936540	What's Sephora?
12940940	12941580	What?
12941580	12944860	Is it Final Fantasy?
12944860	12947260	Oh, I've not played Final Fantasy, my apologies.
12947900	12950540	I thought Goofy was in Final Fantasy or something like that.
12952220	12954300	Sorry, I've not played Final Fantasy,
12954300	12955340	I've not played any of it.
12955340	12957020	Forgive me, okay, fake gamer,
12957020	12958220	only do it for male attention.
12959100	12960060	Sephora?
12960060	12962060	I've never seen the name before!
12962060	12963180	Stop typing names!
12963980	12965180	Like, you can't even be like,
12965180	12966540	oh, she said it wrong.
12968220	12969980	Goofy is in Kingdom Hearts.
12969980	12971100	Wait, what?
12971100	12973420	Oh, wait, I'm getting Final Fantasy
12973420	12974860	in Kingdom's Heart messed up.
12974860	12976780	Sorry, I've not played either before you ask.
12977820	12979260	Sephora, right.
12981420	12982780	You've got Kingdom Hearts sometimes.
12982780	12985420	I'm sorry, like, they look the same or something,
12985420	12985980	I don't know.
12985980	12987820	I ain't played the genres yet.
12987820	12989420	I ain't played the genres yet.
12991260	12992700	The One-Winged Angel,
12992700	12994140	because you'll never guess what he is.
12995260	12995740	Cuddles?
12995740	12997100	I want to give you a womb tattoo,
12997100	12998220	but instead of a traditional one,
12998220	13000300	I want you to put my name on it
13000300	13001900	to show that you're my best friend.
13001900	13003020	Breeding pot, what the?
13004700	13006220	I don't think I should have read that one out loud.
13007180	13007580	Hmm.
13009260	13009580	Hmm.
13010700	13011820	Your technical type though.
13012620	13013180	Be honest.
13015260	13016460	I can't ink to you if you don't know
13016460	13017740	the Final Fantasy lore.
13019020	13020300	He did read that one out there.
13021980	13024380	Wait, I have to learn Final Fantasy lore?
13024380	13024860	Right.
13024860	13026940	Well, I'm Sephiroth, okay?
13026940	13027820	So, there you go.
13027820	13029500	How much more lore do you need
13029500	13030860	before you can base?
13030860	13031420	And base?
13033580	13035180	You're getting male attention and refling.
13035180	13036140	Ink mixed up?
13036140	13036620	I know.
13037500	13039260	Her internal thoughts are full of like,
13039900	13040940	more sane refling.
13042620	13043020	It's like,
13043740	13046220	it's like Dresda, but a femboy?
13046940	13047420	What?
13048300	13049260	Have we got femboy?
13049260	13050540	Are we fighting more femboys?
13050540	13052460	We just bought one in Elden Ring there.
13053740	13054620	Hmm.
13054620	13055820	That's pretty fucking hot.
13055820	13057180	I'm a little reminded though.
13058700	13061100	Eh, not sure if message got filtered.
13061100	13062380	Sorry if it's a repair.
13062380	13064700	Insert glasses, copy past that mummy.
13064700	13066300	I have a thing for nerdy girls with glasses.
13066300	13067100	Since you have glasses,
13067100	13068460	can you pin some on your model?
13069100	13069740	Just for fun.
13069740	13071580	Can you pull and see the reasons why you look like that?
13073100	13073580	Oh no!
13077180	13077580	Yeah.
13086540	13087340	Reeflin.
13089900	13090860	A reeflin.
13090860	13092860	Are you fucking Gamblin?
13094940	13098220	I mean, I'll give it a like and a heart,
13098220	13100380	but don't fucking Gamba.
13100380	13100860	Doin'.
13102940	13105980	I just gambled on Pokemon cards and look what I get.
13106620	13109580	Energies and repeats for a century.
13109580	13111100	Wait, you can't see that tile there.
13111100	13112380	Hold on, I'm bringing it up.
13112380	13114060	Literally, look all these repeats.
13114060	13115820	Repeats, repeats, repeats.
13115820	13117100	Some of them I had multiple.
13117100	13118460	They showed up more than once.
13118460	13120300	Like, you're Gamblin?
13121180	13122460	This is a job.
13122540	13125100	You're gonna lose, the house always wins.
13125100	13128140	Like, literally, I just had to work with Gamblin.
13128140	13129580	If you ignore the specials,
13129580	13131740	but the specials were guaranteed anyway,
13132620	13133820	you just touch them with your feet,
13133820	13136380	you gain 100% more value at once.
13138300	13139500	Gamblin for fun is fine,
13139500	13141900	but throwing money at it is expensive all day.
13141900	13143900	That's not Gamblin, that's RNG on the pack.
13143900	13145020	Gamblin is more Gamblin.
13146540	13147900	No more Gamblin, I'm having this.
13147900	13149180	What if I'm the house?
13149180	13151340	Get it twisted, you will win big.
13151340	13153500	Whoa, that is a reference
13153500	13155100	to hardly anyone's gonna get.
13156220	13157580	Get it twisted.
13158540	13160460	Wow, that's a good reference.
13160460	13161900	I don't like Coke.
13161900	13163580	I don't do Coke, I drink Coke.
13164780	13166860	He has luck from strongy believing him.
13168220	13170300	Someone please fall out New Vega.
13172940	13173740	What, Gamble?
13173740	13175340	You can Gamble and fall out New Vega?
13175340	13177260	Oh, Gamblers stop when they're about to win big.
13177260	13181260	So yeah, you're gonna turn the reflins into addicts.
13182300	13182620	Yeah.
13186220	13187020	Mm-hmm.
13187020	13188060	Let's go Gamblin.
13189180	13189820	Aw, dang it.
13190380	13191900	Mummy dad permission to go pee?
13193340	13194860	No, hold it for five minutes.
13195820	13197820	What, you can't last another five minutes?
13198540	13198860	Really?
13199660	13200940	Hold it for five minutes.
13200940	13202780	You can stay a little time on your phone, it's fine.
13203580	13204780	If you're gonna ask for permission,
13204780	13205740	you're gonna have to wait.
13206460	13210620	Uh, Mummy, I really appreciate how you make time for us,
13210620	13211660	even when you should be working.
13211660	13212620	Even if it's procrastination,
13212620	13216140	glad we entertain and give you back a little bit of what you just said.
13216140	13219660	No, that's what I was trying to say before I got distracted.
13219660	13223100	Imagine helping strongy by giving her 100k for the tip.
13223100	13226300	No, don't give me that kind of money, are you stone?
13226300	13228780	I wouldn't even know what to do with it.
13228780	13230620	Typical nation, thank you for the tip.
13230620	13233100	No, don't give me this kind of money.
13233900	13238780	Don't do that, as I said, for my one year anniversary,
13238780	13241340	I'm gonna purchase the KU100 microphone.
13241340	13243500	It's gonna be out of my money, I'm happy to do that.
13243500	13245260	I wanna experiment with that mic,
13245260	13246940	and say I'm a real ace, Mars, wink, wink,
13246940	13249900	even though I don't have the setup at all enabled for it.
13251100	13253900	No, don't do that, don't give me that kind of money.
13255180	13255980	Wrap it up.
13255980	13258140	That's too much money for one person to have.
13258140	13259340	A multiverse?
13259340	13260300	I don't think so.
13260300	13261820	Too much money for one person to have.
13261820	13263580	A multiverse, honestly.
13266380	13268940	Mommy, you've been playing with the weebaw for like 10 minutes.
13268940	13270620	I mean, I can touch it too, so like...
13273340	13274940	You can get down here if you like.
13276540	13277900	Or does that make it weirder?
13277900	13279260	I don't know, 10 of the weirds.
13280380	13281580	Supply in.
13281580	13283100	You want me to sit on it?
13283100	13283980	I don't even know what's...
13283980	13284620	Is it gonna...
13284620	13287580	If it explodes everywhere, you're fucking cleaning this up.
13287580	13288780	Do you understand reefling?
13289420	13294060	If this explodes, you are cleaning up.
13294060	13296060	All the little balls are about to go everywhere.
13296700	13297260	Hold on.
13297900	13298220	Oh.
13299340	13301260	I can't see it squishing out.
13301820	13302540	Just approve.
13302540	13304140	Oh, sorry, my duplicate.
13304140	13306700	Someone, please think of the health of my duplicate part.
13306700	13307500	Thank you, thank you.
13309100	13309820	Can you see it?
13310620	13311180	It's not...
13311180	13312540	Oh, there's one more card, hold on.
13313740	13317740	If this freaking breaks...
13317820	13318860	I'm gonna be so mad.
13320540	13321660	It's not really...
13324060	13324780	Alleycraft?
13327020	13328780	It looks like a tail, honestly.
13328780	13330620	It looks like a weird marshmallow tail.
13338620	13341420	Mami, you're gonna make that reeflings ball explode, honestly.
13342220	13343900	Oh, excuse me, I'm just standing up.
13343900	13345340	Oh, excuse me.
13346300	13347260	That's terrible.
13351260	13353500	Mami, did you know those balls are wet inside?
13353500	13354700	So, last time I'm saying the things,
13354700	13357980	well, you're cleaning up a cinematic universe.
13357980	13359260	It's gonna go hard, honestly.
13360860	13361820	She's too good.
13361820	13363340	So, you're gonna buy another one then.
13363340	13364220	Another ball?
13364220	13366540	What, you want me to have two balls to play with on stream?
13367260	13369260	I never thought that far ahead, but that makes sense.
13370060	13371340	Typical nation thing for the set.
13372060	13374380	Someone said, like,
13374460	13376220	oh, I want to try and repay you for the thingy.
13376220	13377340	No, you don't understand.
13377340	13378380	I'm in debt to you.
13379100	13382220	Do you understand, like, how happy I am and how fulfilled I am
13382220	13387900	and, like, just how amazing it is to, like, be with you, like, reefling?
13387900	13392140	Like, I don't know how to say it.
13392140	13393500	Like, you're not in debt to me.
13393500	13395020	You don't have to show me any kindness.
13395020	13397820	You don't need XYZ, Elemental P, anything like that.
13398540	13400940	I'm just fucking happy to be here.
13400940	13402140	That is the bottom line.
13402140	13408140	And the truth is, I'll never be able to repay you for anything like that, you know?
13409900	13411500	So don't be, uh, yeah.
13412540	13415900	I think you're now tapped for more time than you've spent.
13415900	13417660	Opening car, I'm sorry.
13417660	13418780	I've yapped, yeah.
13419740	13420620	Sorry, I can't sub.
13420620	13421900	No, it's not like that.
13421900	13422860	You don't have to.
13422860	13423660	Like, you don't have to.
13423660	13425020	That's why I stream every single day.
13425020	13426620	Like, even though I do membership streams,
13426620	13428860	it's not like one day I do a membership stream
13428860	13429820	and no stream on that day.
13429820	13433020	Like, no, I do like a regular, schmagular stream.
13433660	13436620	And then, like, because it's not like that.
13436620	13437740	Like, don't think it's like that.
13437740	13439180	Don't, don't get it twisted.
13440620	13442860	What a strongy stream without a good app.
13442860	13444220	One PP touch on the debt.
13444220	13445020	It's paid.
13445660	13446460	I either can.
13446460	13448220	I'm currently, no, you don't have to.
13448220	13449340	Like, don't think like that.
13452300	13453900	My prediction for 5-0 stream.
13453900	13462940	He's a tenner for sitting on your ball.
13462940	13464620	Did he deserve that?
13464620	13465340	Did it hurt?
13465340	13466860	But did it hurt good?
13466860	13468540	Thank you, basically, Liz, for the tip.
13469660	13471340	My predictions for a 5-hour stream.
13471340	13471900	What are we at?
13474940	13475660	How long?
13476860	13479420	It was 3 hours 44 minutes ago.
13479420	13479900	The fuck?
13481340	13482780	Who else has a shit ton of money
13482780	13483900	to throw this woman in now?
13485900	13486620	Oh my gosh.
13492620	13495180	Well, how about we both agree that it goes both ways?
13496220	13498060	How much for socks off?
13498060	13500220	No, don't give me money for that.
13500220	13501020	I'm not sure.
13501020	13503420	I've still got my pedicure on my feet
13503420	13504540	and I don't like how it looks,
13504540	13506300	so I don't like showing my feet right now.
13506300	13507980	Typical nation, thank you for the tip.
13507980	13509500	Spidey, keep your money.
13509500	13511180	Don't fucking give me money.
13512140	13513740	Right, okay, okay, okay.
13513740	13515180	I'll redirect into Marisa.
13515180	13519900	Let's wrap up like a protection layer.
13521980	13523660	Well, I'll wrap it up, okay?
13523660	13527660	Right, I'm gonna redirect into damn it, I don't...
13527660	13529900	Unless Shibi is streaming.
13529900	13531260	Shibi, technically, what?
13531260	13531900	Should be up in...
13533420	13535260	Should Shibi be up in 10 minutes?
13536300	13537260	Am I going mental?
13539260	13540940	No, she doesn't have her waiting room.
13540940	13542540	So is Emi going waiting room's up?
13542540	13544060	Is this being cancelled?
13546620	13549260	I guess it's been cancelled.
13551420	13552860	Oh, no, Emi can't stream anyway.
13552860	13554140	Dumbass, Emi can't stream.
13554140	13556140	That's why the fucking thing can't be cancelled.
13556140	13557100	Dumbass, dumbass.
13558700	13560540	Okay, I'm gonna...
13560540	13562060	No, stop giving me money, I'm going.
13562060	13563500	So my money, okay.
13563500	13566540	No, Kalker, thank you for the tip.
13567420	13568540	Yep.
13568540	13569900	No, Emi, who?
13570940	13573580	Emi, B-Soup, sorry that you didn't recognize the name.
13573580	13575580	Okay, sorry you didn't recognize the name.
13575580	13576460	Shibi has the members.
13576460	13577980	Marisa is the only one that's been public.
13577980	13579260	Okay, I'll redirect into them.
13579260	13580220	Okay, look at this.
13586220	13587340	This is payment-along.
13587340	13588700	I'm just telling you that everything is okay
13588700	13590620	while I give you hugs and headpats.
13591100	13593900	Oh, that's actually easy.
13593900	13595740	Thank you for the donation.
13595740	13597020	Right, no more fucking money.
13597020	13598140	Stop it, you're stalling me.
13598140	13599580	And I don't want to stall for money.
13599580	13600620	It makes me uncomfortable.
13601340	13603100	Twenty seconds, I really need to wee.
13603100	13603900	Okay, go pee.
13605180	13606460	Don't read this stream.
13606460	13608140	I'm sorry if this comes off as angry.
13619900	13620300	Okay.
13622060	13622380	True.
13623340	13625740	Barbecue pulled pork sandwiches or burgers.
13625740	13627180	What do you want for dinner?
13627180	13629260	Are you making me food?
13629260	13630860	Oh my gosh.
13630860	13631820	What would you look?
13631820	13633260	Beef or pork?
13633260	13635100	I would say burgers
13635100	13637180	because you can put lettuce on it and cheese.
13638220	13641740	I like lettuce and burgers because it's a nice crunch.
13643340	13644780	It's so good.
13644780	13646540	That reef one had some shit to say.
13646540	13647580	Sorry, quietly.
13648140	13649580	Jimmy, B-Soup,
13649580	13652060	Stronathan, Cthulhu, Cthulhu?
13653020	13654140	Cthulhu.
13654140	13655340	Oh, Cthulhu.
13655340	13656140	That's not bad.
13656140	13657340	That's not bad.
13657340	13657980	Love you, Stron.
13657980	13659100	I love you too, reef one.
13659100	13659660	Thank you for the stream.
13659660	13660780	No, thank you for the stream.
13662220	13663820	I apologize for yapping
13663820	13665340	when this was supposed to be a handcam.
13665340	13667100	It's literally just my feet kicking a ball around.
13667100	13668380	But literally, we're playing footy.
13673180	13675420	Strony, you should tell me what to edge to later.
13675420	13675980	Me, bitch.
13676860	13678780	I have like three audios on the alt square.
13678780	13681100	Go, listen to them again and tell me you don't like that shit.
13682700	13685340	And it's a nice, yeah.
13685340	13686700	But I do enjoy getting that.
13686700	13687660	Love you, mommie.
13687660	13688620	So I'm getting distracted.
13688620	13689420	Right, I'm going.
13689420	13690220	I'm going to work.
13690220	13691580	Right, what do you want me to do before?
13691580	13692940	Do you want to like a little dance?
13694700	13696140	Or do we pretend that this is...
13697420	13698060	I don't know.
13699340	13700940	What would you like me to do before we go?
13700940	13701980	Before we wrap it up?
13701980	13702940	Come and walk again.
13702940	13703820	Here, here.
13704540	13705820	I'm Michael Jackson.
13705820	13707100	I touch little things.
13707900	13709820	Who said that?
13709820	13710700	That's wrong.
13710700	13712780	How many nostrils does Michael Jackson have?
13716780	13717580	Brick down there.
13718780	13719500	Put it down there.
13721020	13722220	Oh, you can see me thrusting.
13723180	13724620	You put your hands on your hips.
13730220	13731660	Remove the thoughts and take the...
13732540	13733740	I'm not ruining the thoughts.
13733740	13736540	My feet size, big monster feet.
13736540	13737340	All right, hold on.
13737340	13738540	Are you guys going to put Pokemon cards?
13738540	13740300	Are you going to put Pokemon cards at home?
13741660	13745420	Can you use that Pokemon card?
13747100	13750060	Like, if I do it from my heel there,
13750060	13751740	I'm like two Pokemon cards.
13751740	13754860	And a bit more, like a third Pokemon card comes into it.
13756140	13757420	Just a jump to the top.
13760300	13761580	Can you join the ace monster?
13761580	13762940	Ooh, you're in for a treat tomorrow.
13764700	13765340	Okay.
13765340	13766380	Oh no, my fucking...
13766380	13767580	Oh, my phone's dying.
13768380	13769100	Right, wrap it up.
13769100	13769820	My phone's dead.
13769820	13770300	Wrap it up.
13770300	13771420	The fucking trash is dead.
13773500	13773980	Wrap it up.
13773980	13774860	The track is gone.
13774860	13775820	The track is gone.
13775820	13777020	Reeflings, bedtime.
13777020	13777660	Bedtime, right.
13777660	13778460	Everyone go to bed.
13778460	13779020	Go to sleep.
13779660	13780860	Do you have a banana for scale?
13782300	13783820	The real Pokemon...
13783820	13785260	The real measurements are Pokemon.
13785260	13786700	Forget kilometers.
13786700	13789340	Forget the other unit of measurement.
13789340	13789820	Yards?
13791020	13792060	Oh god, do you see your...
13792060	13794620	No, you can't see your feet are three yards long.
13794620	13795820	That doesn't make any sense.
13797100	13797660	Truly not.
13798700	13799260	Truly not.
13799980	13801980	Mommy's falling to sleep on us.
13801980	13802300	No.
13803180	13804860	It's time to tuck you into bed.
13805980	13807340	After I give you the good suck.
13808380	13809900	Are you gonna be okay?
13812060	13813180	Are you gonna be okay?
13813180	13816780	Now strip off and bounce on that peach on my tentacle.
13816940	13825820	I love reading your marshmallows.
13825820	13826540	Seriously.
13827340	13829180	Yours are so out of pocket.
13829180	13830780	Like the start of the marshmallow.
13830780	13833180	The reason why I read that sentence out loud.
13833180	13834540	Strony, you're so sweet.
13834540	13835980	You're sweet too, Reefling.
13835980	13837740	The love is completely mutual.
13837740	13839900	Now strip off and bounce that peach on my tentacle.
13843420	13845900	Yeah, my track is down.
13847020	13847580	Who said that?
13847580	13848780	Who stole my idea?
13848780	13849420	Give it back.
13851580	13854060	Those five minutes almost made me pee my jeans.
13854060	13855820	Then don't ask for permission again.
13856540	13857980	Because I'm gonna make you good.
13857980	13858300	Okay.
13859180	13860620	You get spanking.
13860620	13863020	Reef, I love you lot.
13863980	13867660	I apologize that this hand cam stream turned into a foot cam.
13869420	13870460	I would say I'm sorry.
13871820	13872860	But am I?
13872860	13873500	No.
13873580	13877100	I give you the content that you do not ask for nor want.
13877900	13880540	And you must be thankful for it.
13880540	13882940	You will be grateful for what I provide.
13882940	13885580	Even though you did not request it at all.
13887100	13887580	At all.
13890700	13892540	Beat or just the hands of the man.
13892540	13893180	That's true.
13893180	13895020	I mean you need to bounce on my feet.
13895020	13896140	Okay, right, right.
13896940	13898140	I love you little Reeflings.
13898140	13898620	I'm gonna go.
13898620	13900780	I'm gonna redirect into Mercy's karaoke.
13901100	13902300	It will be unarchived.
13903740	13906540	Just as a heads up because of copyright issues as always.
13906540	13907340	YouTube ruins it.
13908220	13909900	Thank you everyone for hanging.
13912620	13914140	And for chilling.
13914140	13914940	And binchini.
13914940	13916940	Don't you want binchini?
13916940	13917580	Right on my nose.
13917580	13918540	Okay, you're done.
13920060	13921260	Please look after yourselves.
13921260	13924220	Tomorrow we are getting up to.
13924220	13926460	Let's find out what we're getting up to tomorrow.
13927180	13929660	We are playing with Portal 2.
13929660	13932380	With Sheevee who has never played the game before.
13932380	13934380	So don't be a stinker then.
13934380	13936540	I can never remember the last few puzzles.
13936540	13938460	They get a bit too advanced for my brain.
13939180	13940380	But thank you so so much.
13940380	13942860	I will see you tomorrow for the shaggagagans.
13942860	13944460	Let me and Sheepsters we'll be up to.
13944460	13946300	And we're gonna see if we can finish it in one go.
13946300	13947980	I warned her it's five hours long.
13948620	13951020	But I might be able to remember the puzzles.
13951020	13952460	I'm gonna give her a blast with it.
13952460	13954380	But we can almost come back to it later if she gets the time.
13954380	13955100	It's not a problem.
13955100	13955660	Not a problem.
13955660	13957820	And I know I know these things, okay.
13957900	13960060	All right I love you lots I'll see you tomorrow please.
13960060	13961100	Remember to hydrate.
13961660	13962220	Hydrate.
13963260	13964300	Remember to rest.
13965900	13967660	Remember to look after yourself.
13969100	13973020	Remember to wash behind your ears and your belly button.
13973020	13974780	And scrub yourself down with a flannel.
13976620	13979900	And remember to eat and be kind to yourself.
13981020	13981340	Okay.
