0	17200	I was trying to speedrun up in the stream started and the game.
17200	23680	This game crashes so heckin' easily and it literally just crashed there.
23680	24680	Praying it works.
24680	25680	Praying it works.
25760	26760	Praying it works.
26760	29880	But good morning, good evening, and good afternoon.
29880	30880	Wee today.
30880	34200	My screen is gone black so hopefully I'm still streaming.
34200	37200	Oh my god.
37200	38200	Right.
38200	39200	This game breaks.
39200	42160	Oh, I think it's about to break again.
42160	43160	No way.
43160	46160	Oh, this game breaks so easily.
46160	48880	Oh, don't break, don't break.
48880	51880	Oh, my screen's black again.
51880	52880	What?
52880	58080	Oh, this game breaks so easily.
58080	66080	I think this is like 2007 maybe, but goodness me.
66080	68760	Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.
68760	73360	Wee are playing yet again, surprise surprise, another childhood game.
73360	74360	Wait, what?
74360	75360	Oh, it's 2009.
75360	80200	It says James Cameron's Avatar the game 2009.
80200	90400	So I played this game as a little sheriff and is there a girl that's white with black
90400	101080	hair but, well, not blonde, I'm not, well, we just did that.
101080	106040	Right, we're blonde with green eyes today, yippee.
106040	107040	So this game.
107040	116000	Okay, now it's got enter first name, squiddles, squiddly, I'm feeling a bit squiddly diddly
116000	119720	the day but I bet you'd like that, wouldn't you?
119720	122120	I had no idea they even released the game back then.
122120	132680	Oh, this game is, I, right, I'll shush until the campaign part but they much to the campaign.
132680	134720	Let me, I got slapped together.
134720	135720	Let me tell you that much.
135920	137320	I got slapped together.
141320	142920	Welcome to Pandora.
143920	148320	So, I am a big enthusiast of Avatar.
148320	151720	I absolutely enjoy the movies to the highest of heavens.
157320	159920	Oh my god, I've not played this in years.
160920	165920	Oh, look at us.
165920	167920	Sigourney Weaver.
175920	177920	Big Sigourney Weaver, where'd you been?
177920	179920	We've missed you, Sigourney.
180920	182920	So I got three words for you.
182920	184920	Don't screw up.
184920	185920	Got it.
185920	190920	I like, this is not stood up to the test of time, graphics wise.
190920	192920	My neck be bending.
192920	195920	My armpit textures are warped.
197920	199920	Oh, AC and Snow Berries.
199920	200920	Hi.
200920	202920	How was your puzzle game, AC?
202920	203920	I watched you in the bath.
203920	204920	That's it.
204920	205920	Oh, this is really weird.
205920	210920	I was in the bath and I was like, I'm sure AC should be on right now.
210920	214920	And I opened up the game and you were like, this is a child's game.
214920	215920	How can I do this?
215920	217920	I thought I could do this because I think someone said,
217920	219920	why did you pick this game first?
222920	224920	Snow Berry Raid.
227920	230920	Yeah, there was like a big whale with loads of ropes all over it.
230920	233920	And I was like, I've never seen this game in my life.
233920	234920	I'm too dumb.
234920	235920	Did you not finish it?
235920	236920	Was it like a finished game?
236920	239920	Or was it like one of those ones where it's like, ah, you just played for fun?
241920	242920	Is Sheevee's fault?
242920	244920	Sheevee, what did you do?
244920	246920	She put the ropes in.
246920	247920	Oh, that's very good.
247920	248920	Oh, you finished it.
248920	249920	Let's go.
249920	250920	AC Smart.
250920	251920	AC Smart.
251920	252920	AC Smart.
252920	253920	Hell's gate.
258920	260920	Kendra.
260920	262920	Congrats to your names, Kendra.
263920	266920	Okay, so we are playing an RDA soldier.
266920	267920	Boots on the ground.
267920	270920	We are a signal specialist, okay?
270920	272920	We've just arrived at Hell's Gate,
272920	280920	which is where the humans have landed on the Navi's home planet, basically.
280920	288920	And the way that we humans survive is by sectioning off areas of Pandora,
288920	292920	because Pandora is so aggressive and dangerous.
296920	297920	Wendy, yes.
297920	299920	Shag the big blue ladies.
299920	300920	Soon, soon.
300920	302920	Hold on, hold on.
308920	311920	You've never seen the movie before?
311920	312920	Okay.
312920	313920	Okay.
317920	319920	How do you even summarize Avatar?
326920	332920	This is a very old game, and it is not a fair, like, assessment of what this game's about.
332920	333920	However.
333920	335920	However, however, however.
335920	337920	Too long didn't read, um,
337920	344920	blow people good, humans bad, capitalism bad, being nice to the environment.
344920	345920	Good!
345920	346920	That's it.
346920	347920	That's all you have to know.
347920	349920	That's all you have to know.
349920	353920	You have completely caught up to the Avatar franchise.
353920	355920	Are you squeezing me right now?
355920	356920	Ah!
356920	357920	Bojenga, I'm thinking.
360920	361920	Brian?
362920	367920	Not me getting Brian back on the HUD.
367920	370920	Thank you so much, Bojenga, for the 13, I appreciate it.
370920	374920	I'm looking forward to this stream of this game that literally no one has played.
374920	381920	I wish I could do a poll right now, but if I back out of this game, um, it crashes super easily.
381920	386920	So basically, I don't even know if I'm going for a toilet break today.
386920	388920	I'd like to open a set.
388920	394920	Apparently the campaign mode is eight hours, but I don't believe it.
394920	395920	Yes.
395920	397920	We're at signal specialist.
397920	398920	I didn't even know there was an avatar.
398920	403920	Well, there's a new avatar game now, but we're playing the OG.
403920	405920	Let me take a sip of my honey tea today.
405920	406920	Aloha.
409920	411920	Did you guys watch Mercy's ASMR?
411920	417920	Congrats to Mercy Modis being the only member viewer to not get her VOD taken down
417920	421920	and leave a warning on her channel for sexual misconduct.
421920	423920	Give it up for Mercy!
425920	427920	Oh my God.
428920	430920	Let's go, Mercy.
433920	440920	I am so nervous for my ASMR stream because I had planned something a bit special for it.
441920	448920	And YouTube are dancing with all of us right now.
448920	451920	Sorry, I'll get over the cutscenes first.
451920	454920	We get to experience being in a navi body for the first time.
454920	462920	If you haven't played, or don't know, you enter a booth which neural links you to a actual navi body.
462920	464920	Don't look too much into it.
464920	467920	It's pretty fantasy based and all that jazz, but yeah.
467920	471920	We are now in navi, we have access to a navi body, but we are still RDA.
471920	473920	RDA is the bad guys.
473920	475920	Boo, boo, RDA.
475920	477920	Navi, yay, navi, yay.
477920	479920	But RDA, boo.
483920	484920	Out you get.
484920	485920	Oh my God, that neck!
485920	487920	Oh, that's killing me.
487920	489920	She looks like a giraffe.
489920	491920	She's like, ooh, let me get over this bed real quick.
491920	495920	You're actually quite good at this.
495920	499920	With my fine tuning, you'll be zipping about with the best.
499920	503920	So we have just been introduced to our avatar body.
503920	505920	Navi body.
505920	507920	RDA mission complete.
507920	511920	So yes, this is a much older game.
511920	515920	You need to find Kensington and help him bring the side gates online.
515920	517920	They just shut down.
517920	519920	So we are about to...
519920	521920	He's ready for you.
521920	523920	He's eager to meet you.
523920	525920	He usually doesn't interact with the avatars.
525920	527920	Hate them.
527920	529920	Folks got a thing against avatars.
529920	531920	Like I said, there's more going on here than you know.
531920	533920	It's good for its age, honestly.
533920	535920	So the newest avatar, I haven't had an...
535920	537920	Oh, Brian!
537920	539920	I'm here to be neural linked with a reefling.
539920	541920	This should cover the copay.
541920	543920	Barrow, thank you for the 20.
543920	545920	Would you guys neural link with me?
545920	547920	Like if you could go to bed, like you see everything from AppioV.
547920	549920	Would that still be in control at that point?
549920	551920	Or would you want to control me?
551920	553920	Or would you want me to control you?
559920	561920	Do you really need to ask?
561920	563920	I don't know if you want to see my appeal with me.
563920	565920	You just like dine and be really disappointed that I don't have big boobs.
565920	567920	Does the nicotine patch interfere with the process?
567920	569920	Nah, you can leave it on.
569920	571920	If anything, it makes it better when you're in control.
571920	573920	I don't know.
573920	575920	Nah, you can leave it on.
575920	577920	If anything, it makes it better when you're in control.
577920	579920	So this is the reason
579920	581920	we are
581920	583920	in Pandora,
583920	585920	the world.
585920	587920	You see those purple things underneath?
587920	589920	Those are the resources
589920	591920	we mine from this planet
591920	593920	for capitalism back on Earth.
593920	595920	It is crazy, honestly.
595920	597920	I get to pray.
597920	599920	Hard to believe you're finally here.
599920	601920	Seems like a lifetime ago.
601920	603920	Reporting for duty, sir.
603920	605920	Drop the formality.
605920	607920	Atonement.
607920	609920	Someone in the avatar program is feeding
609920	611920	classified RDA info to the local
611920	613920	Navi squad.
613920	615920	We've got to have a full scale
615920	617920	made of uprising on our hands.
617920	619920	The resources be purple.
619920	621920	You'll see soon enough.
621920	623920	A big boat better than Big Bois.
623920	625920	Your skills as a towbreaker are highly
625920	627920	underrated on this planet.
627920	629920	We're here to get the blue oil.
629920	631920	Someone say oil.
631920	633920	Oh, they can't use
637920	639920	By the dawn
639920	641920	sparely
641920	643920	Did I tell you
643920	645920	in a voice chat
645920	647920	I sung that but I only know the first two lines
647920	649920	and then
649920	651920	freaking Sheevee and Azura
651920	653920	burst out into singing
653920	655920	the actual thing and I was like
655920	657920	oh my god this is really
657920	659920	I was getting
659920	661920	by the dawn
661920	663920	early
663920	665920	lay
665920	667920	I once
667920	669920	I don't know the words at all
669920	671920	and I don't know why it's so hard.
671920	673920	Why does it go high?
673920	675920	Did you guys see my Twitter post about
675920	677920	how much I got scammed on American sweets?
677920	679920	Hello.
679920	681920	So these are just basic transporters
681920	683920	but as you can see this is the whole map
683920	685920	of Pandora. We will unlock a few more locations soon
685920	687920	but there's not really much detail to it.
687920	689920	We're currently at Hell's Gate.
689920	691920	We are going to get flown to Blue Lagoon
691920	693920	but as you can see this earth
693920	695920	is healthy. There's lots of blues and greens
695920	697920	and all that.
697920	699920	It's a nice healthy earth.
699920	701920	Blue Lagoon.
701920	703920	Open the game, oh that's just a
703920	705920	information thing. I thought I was going to explain
705920	707920	what Blue Lagoon is.
707920	709920	Blue Lagoon is where a lot of the navi
709920	711920	that are controlled by the RDA side hangout
711920	713920	and a few of the tribes are tolerant
713920	715920	to our behaviors.
715920	717920	Our human activities.
717920	719920	You want to see the planet?
719920	721920	This is the safest place to do it.
721920	723920	Yes.
723920	725920	So this is tutorial island essentially.
725920	727920	I thought this game was a fever dream.
727920	729920	It's real.
729920	731920	Hi Stormy. I remember playing this game as a kid.
731920	733920	Congrats you're one of the two people
733920	735920	who have played this game.
735920	737920	That's watching right now.
737920	739920	A very very underground game.
739920	741920	I'll tell you a very fun factoid
741920	743920	about this game.
743920	745920	So obviously I was an Xbox kid.
745920	747920	If you were able to obtain a copy
747920	749920	of the
749920	751920	special
751920	753920	Oh
753920	755920	I
755920	757920	loved that little
757920	759920	animation.
759920	761920	This was probably before
761920	763920	motion capture was even a thing
763920	765920	because what the heck was that?
765920	767920	Our encounter
767920	769920	with Pandora's
769920	771920	wildlife. These are
771920	773920	viper wolves.
773920	775920	They're terrifying.
775920	777920	But their designs
777920	779920	are so good.
779920	781920	The animal designs are freaking amazing.
781920	783920	I am needing to
783920	785920	remember
785920	787920	to analyze.
787920	789920	We have freaking special abilities
789920	791920	for some reason.
791920	793920	I can go and visit and shit
793920	795920	but you can level up and progress
795920	797920	and make these abilities way stronger
797920	799920	and literally it's pretty insane.
799920	801920	The game's got loads of things going for it.
801920	803920	So right now we're just
803920	805920	defending the perimeter
805920	807920	from...
807920	809920	What's the way the game isn't too loud?
809920	811920	I cannot adjust the volume without breaking it.
811920	813920	We're just defending the perimeter from
813920	815920	almost a shot or one guy there.
815920	817920	Is it working?
817920	819920	Okay, there we go.
819920	821920	You do get XP.
821920	823920	There is a level up system in this game as well.
823920	825920	I am so bad at aiming. Holy crap.
825920	827920	It's hard with a child.
827920	829920	Child me is like so much
829920	831920	better gamer.
831920	833920	When it comes to this stuff honestly
833920	835920	Lollipop
835920	837920	model confirms
837920	839920	we're doing some rewards
839920	841920	because actually why am I so much better
841920	843920	at this game? I know they spawn over
843920	845920	there a lot.
845920	847920	Okay, objective complete.
847920	849920	Love to see you play the game
849920	851920	but I will be very happy for
851920	853920	every Navi I see die.
853920	855920	You're joking.
855920	857920	You picked the RDA?
857920	859920	Who are you?
859920	861920	Iron Reaper?
861920	863920	You picked the freaking...
863920	865920	Why would you prick?
865920	867920	I literally just had a Freudian slip and
867920	869920	called you a prick there.
869920	871920	Why would you pick?
871920	873920	Not the Navi.
873920	875920	Thank you for the 50. That's insane.
875920	877920	Thank you for the 50.
877920	879920	But you're wrong.
879920	881920	RDA supremacy.
881920	883920	Reflangs?
883920	885920	We're here for...
885920	887920	We're here for nature
887920	889920	and to be nice to wildlings.
889920	891920	I'm literally a cuttlefish.
891920	893920	Are you saying...
893920	895920	Oh is this Halo Controls?
895920	897920	No, kind of.
897920	899920	You can be attacked when you go out
899920	901920	but I will say one thing
901920	903920	the motion sickness. Merci.
903920	905920	If you're lurking do not watch this.
905920	907920	This motion sickness on the vehicles
907920	909920	is insane. Oh we're doing hit and runs.
909920	911920	Oh right, I missed that but whatever.
911920	913920	I can't remember much.
913920	915920	There is going to be...
915920	917920	This guy should...
917920	919920	There is like aim assist in this game
919920	921920	so if you're bad at video games
921920	923920	please don't worry if you ever
923920	925920	think you might want to
925920	927920	give this game a shot.
927920	929920	This game is giving
929920	931920	commands for keyboard but that's
931920	933920	because...
933920	935920	What?
935920	937920	Wait, wait, wait, four pounds!
937920	939920	Wait, where the heck did it go?
941920	943920	I'm fighting.
943920	945920	Oh, we're going to stick a match to go down.
945920	947920	Oh come on!
947920	949920	You can tell Peel as well which is really good in this game.
949920	951920	This game is definitely for people who
951920	953920	are not very...
953920	955920	I would say if you're new to gaming
955920	957920	the game is very friendly to you.
957920	959920	I say that as I literally am forgetting
959920	961920	all the spawn locations of the enemies right now.
961920	963920	These are...
963920	965920	Viper Wolves.
965920	967920	Um...
967920	969920	Literally waiting till this game
969920	971920	gets so beautiful. I wish...
971920	973920	I don't know what the new avatar game is like
973920	975920	genuinely about. I heard those growls.
975920	977920	I heard that!
977920	979920	I have gamer sense, okay?
979920	981920	Oh, there's another one.
981920	983920	Jeez!
983920	985920	My trigger just got stuck there.
985920	987920	Um...
987920	989920	Are you squidding me right now?
989920	991920	What?
995920	997920	No!
997920	999920	The Navi are the good guys!
999920	1001920	Slice Saber?
1001920	1003920	How dare you?
1003920	1005920	Thank you for the tip.
1005920	1007920	But the Navi are the good guys!
1007920	1009920	We're supposed to protect humanity, okay?
1011920	1013920	Right, so we're currently saving
1013920	1015920	the current signal thing.
1015920	1017920	I don't know.
1017920	1019920	Tutorial...
1019920	1021920	We are doing tutorial, but I'm just spamming through it
1021920	1023920	because I want to be Navi.
1023920	1025920	Dogs.
1027920	1029920	Everyone's literally so beefed up
1029920	1031920	in this game for no reason.
1031920	1033920	Wait, you say Navi's good guys
1033920	1035920	protect humanity.
1035920	1037920	The Navi are the big blue ones.
1037920	1039920	The big blue ones protect
1039920	1041920	nature. We protect nature, okay?
1045920	1047920	We...
1047920	1049920	Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, you ready for this?
1049920	1051920	We...
1051920	1053920	We protect nature, little reform.
1053920	1055920	We protect nature, little reform.
1055920	1057920	You want to be a good boy for humanity.
1057920	1059920	You want to recycle
1059920	1061920	where physically possible.
1061920	1063920	But we understand...
1063920	1065920	Oh wait.
1065920	1067920	If the RDA are the bad guys,
1067920	1069920	then why are their mechs so cool?
1069920	1071920	Checkmate, tree huggers.
1071920	1073920	Uh...
1073920	1075920	Well, I'm going to show you
1075920	1077920	me absolutely wrecking and fricking decking
1077920	1079920	those mechs.
1079920	1081920	There's no way you guys are genuinely
1081920	1083920	picking the human side.
1083920	1085920	Doomsday, Dan.
1085920	1087920	You're getting a spank, but thanks for the tip.
1087920	1089920	And Beijing got again.
1089920	1091920	No!
1091920	1093920	You're wrong. You have to be nice.
1093920	1095920	If I have to hit me...
1095920	1097920	Tree huggers!
1097920	1099920	If that makes me a tree hugger, then guess what?
1099920	1101920	I'll proudly identify myself as a tree humper.
1101920	1103920	Oh, I just got her. Oh, I'm getting...
1103920	1105920	I'm getting... I'm getting ganged up on.
1105920	1107920	I'm getting ganged up on.
1107920	1109920	Well, literally, the bark is peeling off
1109920	1111920	from how hard I'm humping the wildlife
1111920	1113920	right now, okay?
1113920	1115920	Because...
1115920	1117920	I'm not...
1117920	1119920	This is so much easier as a child.
1119920	1121920	Hello, child, me. Can you just, like,
1121920	1123920	I don't know, possess my body right now?
1123920	1125920	Because why am I getting wrecked and decked?
1125920	1127920	Glory to the hypno, toad.
1127920	1129920	Protect the navi and the sea stuff.
1129920	1131920	Oh, for goodness sake!
1131920	1133920	I'm getting wrecked! I'm getting wrecked!
1133920	1135920	I'm getting me right now.
1135920	1137920	Only simp for cuttlefish.
1137920	1139920	Human supremacy.
1139920	1141920	Down with the blues freaks.
1141920	1143920	Would you get...
1143920	1145920	Tim... What the heck? Tim Shuttle?
1145920	1147920	Tim Shuttle?
1147920	1149920	Your name is literally cuttlefish, a little Shuttlefish.
1149920	1151920	Glory to the hypno, toad.
1151920	1153920	Protect the navi and the sea stuff.
1153920	1155920	See, Tim knows exactly what he's on about.
1155920	1157920	Thank you, Tim! At least some of us have sent...
1157920	1159920	Are you squidding me right now?
1159920	1161920	Sorry, Strone, but I'll never trust a species
1161920	1163920	whose idea of taming animals
1163920	1165920	is to penetrate them with weird tentacles.
1165920	1167920	Right, you've got me there.
1167920	1169920	You've got me a wee bit there. Hold on, hold on.
1169920	1171920	But give them a chance, give them a chance.
1171920	1173920	Thank you, Otter Von Biscuit.
1173920	1175920	Damn right you only simp for cuttlefish.
1175920	1177920	We the best out here.
1177920	1179920	Oh wait, I just realized,
1179920	1181920	I think I'm supposed to drive the car in here.
1181920	1183920	Oh, I think I'm about to get attacked.
1183920	1185920	Or maybe those guys are protecting me.
1185920	1187920	I'm not sure.
1187920	1189920	There we go.
1189920	1191920	Run now, the logist!
1191920	1193920	Oh!
1193920	1195920	See, you have level up system.
1199920	1201920	I have terrible news for you.
1201920	1203920	If you want to do survival of the fittest,
1203920	1205920	no weapons.
1205920	1207920	Absolutely. Goodness.
1207920	1209920	Is this...?
1209920	1211920	Take this!
1211920	1213920	Fort Bomb.
1213920	1215920	Thank you very much.
1215920	1217920	Uh...
1217920	1219920	Tharja IBW.
1219920	1221920	What a unique...
1221920	1223920	Thank you, thank you very much for the tip.
1223920	1225920	Sorry, Strony, but I'll never trust a species at...
1225920	1227920	Look.
1227920	1229920	All I'm seeing is give tentacles a chance.
1229920	1231920	I might be getting a little tentacle edition here and there, you know?
1231920	1233920	Am I going the wrong way?
1233920	1235920	It looks like I'm going the wrong way on the map.
1235920	1237920	I've not been here before.
1237920	1239920	Oh my goodness, the camera angle.
1239920	1241920	Look, the game aged all right.
1241920	1243920	I'm not going to say it aged well.
1243920	1245920	Wait, is there a little path back here?
1245920	1247920	It's a lie.
1247920	1251920	Oh my goodness, this camera angle is horrific.
1251920	1253920	I'm getting sick myself.
1253920	1255920	Let me in.
1255920	1257920	Let me in.
1257920	1259920	I'm human. What are you doing?
1259920	1261920	Okay, I actually have to go backwards.
1261920	1263920	Thank you, not Alessandro as well.
1263920	1265920	Rules of nature, survival pit.
1265920	1269920	Oh my god, lady driver moment.
1269920	1271920	Please, camera angle.
1271920	1273920	Please, jeez, Louise.
1273920	1275920	Let me work here.
1275920	1277920	My goodness, this is awful.
1277920	1279920	Why is the camera dead?
1279920	1281920	Oh my god.
1281920	1283920	This is horrific.
1283920	1285920	Are you kidding me right now?
1285920	1287920	Oh, thank god I don't get emotional things in the video game.
1287920	1289920	Do not expect the message to work this time long.
1289920	1291920	Anyways, have fun, strongy, and rejoice.
1291920	1293920	Brian's back.
1293920	1295920	So when you tip, you can actually, like,
1295920	1297920	I can hear it and you can hear it.
1297920	1299920	Thank you again for the another tip, Alessandro.
1299920	1301920	Bitches, when you tip, you will never be read out.
1301920	1303920	Oh my god.
1303920	1305920	That camera angle is horrific.
1305920	1307920	Please, do not ever make me drive one of those again.
1307920	1309920	Thank you.
1309920	1311920	Oh, goodness me.
1311920	1313920	Right, what is the heck is this?
1313920	1315920	I've forgotten.
1315920	1317920	Oh, it's a teleport pod.
1317920	1319920	Okay, you can teleport between the different regions.
1319920	1321920	So this is all the Blue Lagoon area.
1321920	1323920	As you can see, there's one, two, three, four, five.
1323920	1325920	Why are the teleport points all at the bottom
1325920	1327920	and only one at the top?
1327920	1329920	I'll see how it is.
1329920	1331920	Make a mirror walk everywhere.
1331920	1333920	Okay, a little sip of my tea.
1333920	1335920	Have you played it?
1335920	1337920	Are you sure you've played this before?
1337920	1339920	The accusations?
1339920	1341920	I'm not beating the accusations.
1341920	1343920	Right, I'm going to finish my tea before it gets too cold.
1345920	1347920	I'm delicious.
1347920	1349920	I like the reverb effect on the burp.
1349920	1351920	I mean, I don't want to ruin anything,
1351920	1353920	but that definitely may or may not happen
1353920	1355920	in a certain ASMR stream.
1355920	1357920	I like freakin' changed the title of the ASMR stream
1357920	1359920	because I don't know what is going on.
1359920	1361920	Everyone's getting warnings left, right, and center.
1361920	1363920	Now, don't get me wrong.
1363920	1365920	Any jumping up and doing on the bed,
1365920	1367920	it's quite humorous, okay?
1367920	1369920	And I don't know, did she be actually doing
1369920	1371920	anything that was that wrong?
1371920	1373920	Azura, now, the only reason I will say
1373920	1375920	Azura had received that warning
1375920	1377920	was on the pure basis.
1377920	1379920	Her voice is just like honey.
1379920	1381920	Her voice is
1381920	1383920	the sun embracing you
1383920	1385920	after a few days of rain.
1385920	1387920	Her voice is like honey.
1387920	1389920	Her voice is like
1389920	1391920	that hug you have needed for a
1391920	1393920	years, and you just
1393920	1395920	let it all out, and you
1395920	1397920	like, her...
1397920	1399920	However,
1399920	1401920	the other side of the coin for
1401920	1403920	Azura's voice is
1403920	1405920	it won't go down.
1405920	1407920	It can't stay down.
1407920	1409920	There's no such thing as a refractory
1409920	1411920	period to her when you listen
1411920	1413920	to her voice. Maybe you'll get 10 minutes
1413920	1415920	of peace at max, you know what I'm saying?
1415920	1417920	So, I can't
1417920	1419920	get why she got a warning. I don't think
1419920	1421920	she got a warning because she was
1421920	1423920	wise enough to private it.
1423920	1425920	I don't know, I don't know if she did delete that.
1427920	1429920	Did she do ear licking?
1429920	1431920	Goodness me, can't even do it with ear licking.
1431920	1433920	I don't know what's going on, because people
1433920	1435920	that show their face are still uploading
1435920	1437920	all fine and dandy, so I think
1437920	1439920	there might be a H-E-N
1439920	1441920	update to the tie.
1441920	1443920	Possibly
1443920	1445920	pop stealth policy. Oh god, not the camera
1445920	1447920	angle again.
1447920	1449920	I'm currently driving with one hand, so this
1449920	1451920	is going to go absolutely awful.
1451920	1453920	But look how big Pandora is, it's fantastic.
1455920	1457920	One hand steering whilst I
1457920	1459920	drink my tea.
1459920	1461920	I'm like a real contractor, honestly.
1463920	1465920	Look, I'm just here to do the contract work.
1465920	1467920	I'm not here to do anything special.
1467920	1469920	I get paid on the day.
1469920	1471920	Okay,
1471920	1473920	driving isn't actually that bad, right?
1473920	1475920	Let's speed up, let's go.
1475920	1477920	Let's see if two handed, I'm even worse,
1477920	1479920	probably.
1481920	1483920	Oh, I'm hitting, I'm hitting the land.
1483920	1485920	I'm doing the Titanic.
1485920	1487920	Titanic momentum.
1493920	1495920	Yes, thank you.
1495920	1497920	Thank you for the tip, Kitsune.
1497920	1499920	Literally,
1499920	1501920	I don't think I've really
1501920	1503920	met anyone that's
1503920	1505920	heard about this heckin' game.
1505920	1507920	But I'm glad that a few of you actually have played it.
1507920	1509920	Okay, I'm just on the walking teleport stations
1509920	1511920	when I do that.
1511920	1513920	Hi, hi everyone joining.
1513920	1515920	We're playing Avatar, James Cameron's
1515920	1517920	Avatar. Some people thought
1517920	1519920	it was Avatar
1519920	1521920	the last airbender related.
1521920	1523920	No, no, no, no, no.
1523920	1525920	Not at all. Although, I think
1525920	1527920	we might be doing a watch along with that.
1527920	1529920	If you're into watch-alongs, please do
1529920	1531920	think about supporting your local neighborhood
1531920	1533920	little sister, because she may be
1533920	1535920	doing a watch along with that already.
1535920	1537920	I'm going to take a little sipping tune of my cola.
1537920	1539920	I need to hydrate.
1539920	1541920	Now I get to ramble about
1541920	1543920	all the work I did yesterday.
1543920	1545920	Okay, so the update is
1545920	1547920	Are you squidding me right now?
1547920	1549920	Unless.
1549920	1551920	Brian!
1555920	1557920	Honestly though,
1557920	1559920	thank you for the tip.
1559920	1561920	Tarja.
1561920	1563920	I feel like that's not how you're supposed to pronounce it.
1563920	1565920	Or are you Swedish and it's
1565920	1567920	Tarja?
1567920	1569920	A little bit of a Swedish
1569920	1571920	moment.
1571920	1573920	Look, it's that guy we saved
1573920	1575920	in that cave only a few minutes
1575920	1577920	ago.
1577920	1579920	Viper Wolves.
1579920	1581920	Viper Wolves.
1585920	1587920	What kind of cola?
1587920	1589920	Just cola cola.
1589920	1591920	Is it called Coke Zero
1591920	1593920	when it's got the no sugar?
1593920	1595920	I finally went no sugar on the cola.
1595920	1597920	Aspartame.
1597920	1599920	I can finally tolerate aspartame.
1599920	1601920	It is that thing that is in the drinks
1601920	1603920	to make it sugar free.
1603920	1605920	But I was like, I don't mind having
1605920	1607920	a big badonk-a-donk, but I don't want
1607920	1609920	it to get too big, so I'm now
1609920	1611920	drinking aspartame, which apparently
1611920	1613920	gives rats cancer.
1613920	1615920	So it's not looking good for us mammals.
1615920	1617920	But hey, oh, you gotta die something
1617920	1619920	and, you know, I'm not going out
1619920	1621920	without enjoying myself.
1621920	1623920	That's all I'm saying on them.
1623920	1625920	There are Viper Wolves here, so please excuse
1625920	1627920	the combat.
1627920	1629920	Boom.
1629920	1631920	Now, you can just kind of do this.
1631920	1633920	But it does bring
1633920	1635920	you out of fricking invisibility.
1635920	1637920	Get in the boat! Get in the boat! Drive away!
1637920	1639920	Drive away!
1639920	1641920	Yeah, see, they get scared of my little
1641920	1643920	fart bomb.
1643920	1645920	Actually, I think it's called a supersonic wave
1645920	1647920	and they don't like the noise, which makes
1647920	1649920	sense. You know, nature doesn't like loud
1649920	1651920	noises. Can relate
1651920	1653920	on a
1653920	1655920	physiological...physiological?
1655920	1657920	No, not physiological.
1657920	1659920	Now, you can just skip quite a bit of combat
1659920	1661920	if you're cheeky, but only
1661920	1663920	if you're smart enough to do the things
1663920	1665920	in the correct timing. I'm going to heal up.
1665920	1667920	You can heal up naturally and it just
1667920	1669920	means gentle for time. As I said, this game
1669920	1671920	is super forgiving to new gamers.
1671920	1673920	If you are into
1673920	1675920	that fantasy element,
1675920	1677920	am I to walk from here?
1677920	1679920	I can walk from here.
1681920	1683920	Nature doesn't like loud noises.
1683920	1685920	Literally, the loudest of nature.
1689920	1691920	The sea bomb or a big badonka,
1691920	1693920	those are the two choices.
1693920	1695920	I don't mind getting too big.
1695920	1697920	No, sorry, I do mind getting too big.
1697920	1699920	You gotta keep that pear-shaped bone.
1699920	1701920	You know, like when I do that
1701920	1703920	hand cam stream, everyone's
1703920	1705920	going to know the real size of my
1705920	1707920	chest.
1719920	1721920	Yes, I
1721920	1723920	will teach you all the strats of this game.
1723920	1725920	And for those
1725920	1727920	who are wondering, is this
1727920	1729920	an adjourned stream? This is roughly
1729920	1731920	a
1731920	1733920	seven-hour
1733920	1735920	strom.
1735920	1737920	So do feel free to strum yourself
1737920	1739920	for the full seven hours, if not,
1739920	1741920	then the seven-hour stream.
1741920	1743920	Roughly.
1743920	1745920	I believe we will actually successfully
1745920	1747920	catch Mercy for a redirect
1747920	1749920	if my humble Mercy
1749920	1751920	is streaming today, which I believe she is.
1751920	1753920	As always, if any
1753920	1755920	of my gen mates come online, please
1755920	1757920	remind me and I will
1757920	1759920	tell those who would
1759920	1761920	much prefer to watch a game that isn't
1761920	1763920	archaic, or whatever they're
1763920	1765920	doing on stream.
1765920	1767920	We're supposed to
1767920	1769920	for seven hours. I feel
1769920	1771920	like that would
1771920	1773920	hurt.
1773920	1775920	But anyway, because
1775920	1777920	I cannot tell you how strange
1777920	1779920	it was to go offline after
1779920	1781920	two hours, it
1781920	1783920	literally felt like, what do we
1783920	1785920	do now? Oh, now we play the game.
1785920	1787920	Because I was like, wait, I have
1787920	1789920	so much time.
1789920	1791920	So
1791920	1793920	I've got three more
1793920	1795920	ASMR collabs on the way. I did a little
1795920	1797920	bit of socializing. We are now Navi.
1797920	1799920	We're about to do some Navi quest lines.
1799920	1801920	But please remember, we are
1801920	1803920	RDA Navi.
1803920	1805920	To use teleportations, we use
1805920	1807920	the Tree of Vision. It's very
1807920	1809920	important to get those because my goodness, it makes
1809920	1811920	travel so much easier.
1811920	1813920	Look how tall we are.
1815920	1817920	And the camera angle has changed and
1817920	1819920	is much more favorable.
1819920	1821920	I prefer when
1821920	1823920	video games have a really pulled
1823920	1825920	out third perspective camera.
1825920	1827920	If the camera is two centimeters
1827920	1829920	away from my face, I do not like it.
1829920	1831920	I find it very hard to look at.
1831920	1833920	I don't know if that's because
1833920	1835920	I need
1835920	1837920	glasses and I still
1837920	1839920	haven't trained myself to wear
1839920	1841920	glasses.
1841920	1843920	Very bad girl, bad girl, very
1843920	1845920	naughty.
1845920	1847920	But I think that my preference
1847920	1849920	in video games is a zoom out angle.
1849920	1851920	It might be related to that because
1851920	1853920	yeah.
1853920	1855920	But hey,
1855920	1857920	does anyone know the full
1857920	1859920	name of the game and it's on
1859920	1861920	Steam? I
1861920	1863920	don't even know if it's on
1863920	1865920	Steam.
1865920	1867920	It is called
1867920	1869920	James Cameron's Avatar.
1869920	1871920	Okay, the Navi can go through
1871920	1873920	these doors. Nope.
1873920	1875920	Only when they're green. Okay, sure, sure.
1875920	1877920	We are about
1877920	1879920	to encounter the wildlife. They will still
1879920	1881920	attack us even if we are Navi
1881920	1883920	and RDA.
1883920	1885920	Does not matter. Where the heck
1885920	1887920	am I going? I'm going the wrong way.
1887920	1889920	That's why I'm getting turned around.
1889920	1891920	Now again, we do have superpowers.
1891920	1893920	We have sprint. We have invincibility.
1893920	1895920	We have health. And we have
1895920	1897920	ground smash, which is
1897920	1899920	very good. In order
1899920	1901920	to get healing
1901920	1903920	if you look
1903920	1905920	on when that health bar
1905920	1907920	comes up again, you'll notice the number
1907920	1909920	zero at the bottom left, on the right
1909920	1911920	side of the health bar that appears
1911920	1913920	bottom left. The more cell
1913920	1915920	samples we pick up, the more
1915920	1917920	second chances we have.
1917920	1919920	Now it's very common to
1919920	1921920	run out of health in this game.
1921920	1923920	It's just the thing that happens.
1923920	1925920	It's not a big deal. Again, the game
1925920	1927920	is very forgiving. You can literally do
1927920	1929920	this all the way through the game, and
1929920	1931920	anything can hardly hit you.
1931920	1933920	But the later sections of the game
1933920	1935920	I don't know if there weren't
1935920	1937920	many playtesters, because it was
1937920	1939920	very rough in the later sections
1939920	1941920	of the game. I've done that game pretty rough.
1941920	1943920	We are going to unlock this Tree of Vision
1943920	1945920	so now we can teleport to this region
1945920	1947920	when we come back to 100%
1947920	1949920	of the region.
1951920	1953920	How many games do you have
1953920	1955920	lined up? Do you mean
1955920	1957920	to play in general?
1957920	1959920	If you mean
1959920	1961920	games overall
1961920	1963920	like daily
1963920	1965920	streaming games for a year?
1965920	1967920	Question mark!
1967920	1969920	Next week in
1969920	1971920	endurance is Skyrim.
1971920	1973920	It's another childhood game of mine.
1973920	1975920	I used to
1975920	1977920	do 100% achievements in Skyrim
1977920	1979920	every year, because I really appreciate
1979920	1981920	the game and its vanilla form. I do apologize
1981920	1983920	if you like mullets, but...
1983920	1985920	I don't know what to say.
1985920	1987920	I'm very...
1987920	1989920	We aren't friends?
1989920	1991920	We aren't friends?
1991920	1993920	Would you guys
1993920	1995920	really
1995920	1997920	appreciate a bit more?
1997920	1999920	What?
1999920	2001920	100?
2005920	2007920	Also humans number one baby.
2007920	2009920	No!
2009920	2011920	Anonymous!
2011920	2013920	No! Bad boy!
2013920	2015920	Bad boy!
2015920	2017920	Thank you for the 100.
2017920	2019920	That's a lot of money though. Please make sure
2019920	2021920	you're looking after yourself and treating yourself.
2021920	2023920	100 is a lot. Jesus!
2023920	2025920	Bad and on! Bad boy!
2025920	2027920	Come get spankings right now. Bad!
2029920	2031920	Let me take a sipping then.
2031920	2033920	Are you squidding me right now?
2033920	2035920	Good just me.
2039920	2041920	Exactly, Nero!
2043920	2045920	Exactly!
2045920	2047920	We stand nature in this house.
2047920	2049920	We will look after nature.
2049920	2051920	As you can literally hear me dancing about
2051920	2053920	in my chair right now.
2053920	2055920	So we are...
2055920	2057920	What the heck is that zone?
2057920	2059920	And why is it so big? Oh, we're plant sampling.
2059920	2061920	Okay, this is tutorial section.
2061920	2063920	When I explained...
2063920	2065920	Thank you for the tip again, Nero.
2065920	2067920	Anonymous, my goodness, that was a lot of money.
2067920	2069920	Please...
2069920	2071920	Is something attacking me? No.
2071920	2073920	When you pick up cell samples, there's that little
2073920	2075920	white bar on the left side.
2075920	2077920	I didn't... And you thought there was enemies
2077920	2079920	because I was like, why am I getting...
2079920	2081920	Playing as an avatar. As an avatar,
2081920	2083920	Pondora's flora
2083920	2085920	which means
2085920	2087920	flowers
2087920	2089920	and fauna
2089920	2091920	means
2091920	2093920	animals.
2093920	2095920	Yes.
2095920	2097920	It's less aggressive towards you.
2097920	2099920	Therefore, killing an offensive creatures
2099920	2101920	and plants will not yield
2101920	2103920	experience points.
2103920	2105920	All the reeflings siding with humans
2105920	2107920	want to be the guy from Stronny's law video.
2107920	2109920	Oh, I'm so bad.
2109920	2111920	Hope a siren doesn't drown me.
2111920	2113920	Thank you!
2113920	2115920	Thank you, Anonymous, for the tip.
2115920	2117920	Oh, you guys
2117920	2119920	don't want me to, you know,
2119920	2121920	take you down in the waters with me.
2121920	2123920	That's not...
2123920	2125920	Honestly, my lore is so evil.
2125920	2127920	I promise. I don't want to...
2127920	2129920	I don't want to hurt...
2129920	2131920	Why do I suck so bad at this?
2131920	2133920	Wait, what was that?
2133920	2135920	No way! They have a slow motion kill cam!
2135920	2137920	I did not
2137920	2139920	recall that whatsoever.
2139920	2141920	That's amazing.
2141920	2143920	Don't threaten us with a good time.
2143920	2145920	That sounds very yandere-esque.
2145920	2147920	But, yeah, in terms of evilness
2147920	2149920	and lore, why?
2149920	2151920	What was that? I heard that.
2151920	2153920	Oh, I can hear it!
2153920	2155920	I actually got scared there.
2155920	2157920	I heard it, but I couldn't turn
2157920	2159920	the analog stick in time.
2159920	2161920	So, if I am human...
2161920	2163920	Why are there so many?
2165920	2167920	Oh, no, I heard the plant.
2167920	2169920	I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Plant.
2169920	2171920	I'm actually getting a bit scared.
2171920	2173920	Why is there so many?
2173920	2175920	Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on,
2175920	2177920	hold on, hold on, hold on. Pause.
2177920	2179920	Pause! I hear more!
2179920	2181920	Oh, my God, they're literally biting my ankles!
2181920	2183920	They're biting my ankles!
2183920	2185920	Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
2185920	2187920	Stop.
2187920	2189920	Okay, relax.
2189920	2191920	Relax.
2191920	2193920	We're just collecting cell samples
2193920	2195920	in this area. I think I've hurt every...
2195920	2197920	All the enemies are gone.
2197920	2199920	Yeah, so these
2199920	2201920	type animals don't attack.
2201920	2203920	They can't bite my ankles, man.
2203920	2205920	If you are human and come across
2205920	2207920	this plant, it is very
2207920	2209920	poisonous. It spits a
2209920	2211920	bale at you, which is actually really cool.
2211920	2213920	But
2213920	2215920	the design elements that went
2215920	2217920	into this game is just
2217920	2219920	beautifully...
2219920	2221920	Or...
2223920	2225920	But, yeah, like, the development,
2225920	2227920	you can actually...
2227920	2229920	Yeah, you can, like, scan...
2229920	2231920	Who goes there? Who goes there?
2231920	2233920	You can, like, scan stuff
2233920	2235920	and add it to a database and that.
2235920	2237920	I've never 100% of that. Maybe we could do that?
2237920	2239920	Oh, no, we can't
2239920	2241920	because I would have to play the RDA side.
2241920	2243920	But I'm not playing the bad boy side.
2243920	2245920	But, yeah, like, if you're into, like, 100%
2245920	2247920	completion, absolutely can do that kind of thing.
2251920	2253920	Oh.
2253920	2255920	But it is...
2255920	2257920	A very beautiful game.
2257920	2259920	I am very much into, like, alternative, like...
2259920	2261920	Oh.
2261920	2263920	Oh. Oh.
2263920	2265920	I saw that.
2265920	2267920	It popped up my little thingies. I knew it.
2273920	2275920	Right, where are we going? We're just heading next.
2275920	2277920	We can do this
2277920	2279920	and just kind of try and bypass
2279920	2281920	all the enemies on the way.
2281920	2283920	Enemies.
2283920	2285920	Did you watch the second movie?
2285920	2287920	I absolutely did.
2287920	2289920	I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie
2289920	2291920	with Jake Sully.
2291920	2293920	Absolutely.
2293920	2295920	Congrats, if your name's Jake, by the way.
2297920	2299920	Absolutely
2299920	2301920	fantastic movies.
2301920	2303920	Completely captured me in that kind of fantasy
2303920	2305920	different world.
2305920	2307920	Especially the nighttime scenes
2307920	2309920	when everything is lighten up.
2309920	2311920	Oh, speaking of lighten up, hold on.
2315920	2317920	Reactive model.
2317920	2319920	You ready? Reactive model?
2319920	2321920	Do you want this? Or do you want my normal model?
2321920	2323920	I can turn it over.
2323920	2325920	The bioluminescent scenes.
2325920	2327920	Yes, bioluminescent scenes.
2329920	2331920	Pushing boots to destroyed
2331920	2333920	Avatar 2 in the box office.
2337920	2339920	Woo! Our first meet with a navi.
2339920	2341920	Like an actual navi.
2341920	2343920	Not an RDA navi.
2343920	2345920	Are you ready? Hello, Tanjala.
2345920	2347920	Oh, I'm stuck on
2347920	2349920	this corpse of a themobobber.
2349920	2351920	Hello.
2351920	2353920	Hello, I'm a kaya.
2357920	2359920	This is good.
2363920	2365920	Oh, Renee Harper is
2365920	2367920	Sigourney Weaver.
2367920	2369920	She's been poused with a navi.
2369920	2371920	She overflicks them. Tanjala wants
2371920	2373920	you to kill the
2373920	2375920	sick strumb beasts.
2375920	2377920	Anyone else identify themselves as a
2377920	2379920	strumb beast? Cause
2379920	2381920	that's ridiculous.
2381920	2383920	We're really starting to dig hard
2383920	2385920	for these words.
2387920	2389920	Avatar 2 had no story at all.
2389920	2391920	Perfect how not to make a sequel.
2391920	2393920	I disagree. Brian!
2393920	2395920	Don't worry, Stronny. I played
2395920	2397920	navi 2 when I was younger.
2397920	2399920	I liked having all the animals be
2399920	2401920	my friends. Exactly, Grimbo.
2401920	2403920	Thank you for the tip.
2403920	2405920	We do, Brian. The first movie was just
2405920	2407920	a crossover between Pocahontas and
2407920	2409920	Ferngully. I have not seen Ferngully.
2409920	2411920	Bejinga, thank you
2411920	2413920	for the tip. What's Ferngully? Have you
2413920	2415920	guys seen Ferngully?
2415920	2417920	Are you doing your way to eat?
2417920	2419920	You like
2419920	2421920	Sigourney Weaver a lot.
2421920	2423920	Sigourney Weaver
2423920	2425920	the first thing I've seen her in
2425920	2427920	were just to destroy these by the way.
2427920	2429920	Sigourney Weaver Avatar
2429920	2431920	was the first thing I ever saw her in.
2431920	2433920	And I just adored her.
2433920	2435920	I adored her character. Her voice
2435920	2437920	is so lovely as well.
2437920	2439920	It's such a...
2439920	2441920	If you ever struggle at this
2441920	2443920	point, just jump up on this rock right here.
2443920	2445920	They can't hurt you
2445920	2447920	if you go on the rock.
2447920	2449920	They can't do a thing. If you're on the
2449920	2451920	floor, these guys will knock you over
2451920	2453920	and take a big chunk of your health.
2453920	2455920	Is something else attacking me?
2455920	2457920	No.
2457920	2459920	But we're good to go.
2461920	2463920	Robin Williams plays a bat in this.
2467920	2469920	Ferngully is basically the
2469920	2471920	Barbie Pixie...
2471920	2473920	The Barbie Pixie movie
2473920	2475920	in 2D, but human...
2475920	2477920	It depends on that guy.
2477920	2479920	It was a good movie.
2479920	2481920	The direct to VHS
2481920	2483920	was okay.
2483920	2485920	Tim Curry sings.
2485920	2487920	Oh my god, Rocky Horror Picture
2487920	2489920	Show. You put your hands on
2489920	2491920	your leg. No, that's not right.
2491920	2493920	You put your hands on your hips.
2493920	2495920	That's it.
2499920	2501920	We should watch that.
2501920	2503920	My mum
2503920	2505920	really likes that movie.
2505920	2507920	I've watched it from a young age.
2507920	2509920	Yeah, it's absolutely bizarre
2509920	2511920	to conceptualize what on earth happens
2511920	2513920	in that movie at a young age.
2513920	2515920	But hey ho, that's just life.
2515920	2517920	That's just how it is.
2517920	2519920	Oh, I heard.
2519920	2521920	Butta Dog.
2521920	2523920	I heard that.
2523920	2525920	And mama.
2525920	2527920	What are you doing here?
2527920	2529920	I'm so tiny.
2529920	2531920	Oh no, I'm so big.
2531920	2533920	V, you're Azura.
2533920	2535920	You're talking to Azura right now.
2535920	2537920	This is the height difference between you and Azura.
2537920	2539920	I'm shutting down the knob.
2539920	2541920	It's Emmy and Azura.
2541920	2543920	Oh, it's Emmy.
2545920	2547920	A giant woman.
2547920	2549920	Now, don't lie.
2549920	2551920	Don't lie right now
2551920	2553920	and say to me, I didn't cook
2553920	2555920	with making Azura a giant test.
2555920	2557920	I will not take...
2557920	2559920	If that's not going to hurt me,
2559920	2561920	I'm laying it boys.
2561920	2563920	We're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it.
2567920	2569920	We're just going to stealth through this section.
2569920	2571920	There's a lot of dire wolves.
2571920	2573920	Viper wolves.
2573920	2575920	However, we're no interested
2575920	2577920	in fighting.
2577920	2579920	We're just going to zoom past
2579920	2581920	because this entire section
2581920	2583920	is optional honestly.
2583920	2585920	We're just going to zoom ahead again.
2585920	2587920	Cooked, you did indeed cook.
2587920	2589920	No, I knew I wanted
2589920	2591920	some sort of thick Vtuber model.
2591920	2593920	I'm sorry, I'm going to say it.
2593920	2595920	There's really not that much variety
2595920	2597920	for the thick
2597920	2599920	and for the chocolate.
2599920	2601920	So, it was just
2601920	2603920	absolutely no questions asked.
2603920	2605920	Probably going to do the same in Gen 2
2605920	2607920	where, you know, something's going to be lovely.
2607920	2609920	Brian!
2615920	2617920	Awwww.
2617920	2619920	Is she the main...
2619920	2621920	Is she the main alien?
2621920	2623920	Because I remember reading a really...
2623920	2625920	Oh, we're on a horse by the way.
2625920	2627920	Check it out. Look at my horse.
2627920	2629920	My horse is amazing.
2629920	2631920	Oh my god, his face is all...
2631920	2633920	That's a really unfortunate face.
2633920	2635920	But everything else, yeah, it's alright.
2637920	2639920	Look, I'm riding a pony. I'm such a girl.
2641920	2643920	Oh my god, this is the girls game as well.
2643920	2645920	Oh, there's actually a really... This is really boring.
2645920	2647920	But when we come back to this section later,
2647920	2649920	an enemy always spawns on this rock
2649920	2651920	and he's infinite stuck
2651920	2653920	and you can never, like, hurt him.
2653920	2655920	Well...
2655920	2657920	Okay.
2657920	2659920	It's time. We need to make a decision.
2659920	2661920	Are we Navi?
2661920	2663920	Thank you very much, Iron Reaper, for the tip.
2663920	2665920	I think I actually forgot to say that.
2665920	2667920	But thank you for the tip.
2667920	2669920	Are you squidding me right now?
2669920	2671920	Nero!
2673920	2675920	Thank you, Nero, for the tip.
2679920	2681920	So we are a signal specialist
2683920	2685920	and we've set those signals up
2685920	2687920	but we were told that they weren't gonna...
2687920	2689920	It wasn't gonna be used for destroying Navi.
2691920	2693920	Nory, Nory.
2703920	2705920	Great work, Ryder.
2705920	2707920	I smell promotion in the air.
2707920	2709920	Do you realize what you're doing?
2709920	2711920	Think about what you're doing.
2711920	2713920	Any of this look familiar?
2713920	2715920	Wait, that's...
2717920	2719920	So we're learning we just destroyed all the Navi's home?
2723920	2725920	I didn't do this.
2725920	2727920	Everyone's hearing about it.
2727920	2729920	The new SIG spec locked the target.
2729920	2731920	What the hell did you think you were doing?
2731920	2733920	They told me it was...
2733920	2735920	Are we the baddies?
2737920	2739920	They used you, Ryder.
2743920	2745920	Ryder? Hardly even nor.
2747920	2749920	Oh wait, sorry, sorry.
2749920	2751920	Hold on, do that again.
2751920	2753920	Ryder? Hardly even nor.
2753920	2755920	Hardly even nor.
2765920	2767920	Come on, how goofy is that?
2769920	2771920	I wanted to see...
2771920	2773920	Ray, are you ready? Are you ready? We're gonna do it again.
2775920	2777920	Okay, hold on.
2777920	2779920	Let's do this bit and then when we're mucking about I'll do it again, okay?
2779920	2781920	That was amazing.
2784920	2786920	Right, so this is where you decide.
2786920	2788920	Do you want to be Navi or do you want to be RDA?
2788920	2790920	If I shoot him, we become RDA.
2790920	2792920	If I shoot him...
2792920	2794920	WE BECOME NAVI!
2794920	2796920	And defend this Pandora
2796920	2798920	in the name of being a foreigner.
2798920	2800920	We need to kill it. We guys first go.
2800920	2802920	Destroy him!
2802920	2804920	Just... Oh, I'm low health.
2804920	2806920	Oh my god, I'm farting about too much.
2806920	2808920	Oh, why is he so strong?
2808920	2810920	Right, go...
2810920	2812920	Wait, I'm actually gonna get...
2812920	2814920	I'm gonna perish.
2814920	2816920	He's like actually wrecking and decking me.
2816920	2818920	What's going on?
2818920	2820920	Why is his health not going down?
2820920	2822920	Why is my aim bot so bad?
2822920	2824920	Right, hold on, hold on.
2824920	2826920	Hold on, let me aim bot.
2826920	2828920	He healed up! No, no!
2828920	2830920	Only I'm allowed to heal up.
2832920	2834920	The enemies shouldn't be allowed to heal up.
2834920	2836920	It should be illegal in video games.
2836920	2838920	Development team, you have failed.
2838920	2840920	It should be...
2840920	2842920	He's shooting me as well.
2842920	2844920	Can you like shoot the other guy?
2844920	2846920	Right, hold on. Let me readjust this aim bot.
2846920	2848920	No, he healed up!
2848920	2850920	Only I'm supposed to have him healed up!
2850920	2852920	Right, that's it.
2852920	2854920	Grimped!
2854920	2856920	Didn't even work. Did it work?
2856920	2858920	I don't know.
2858920	2860920	I'm gonna be honest, this is a few too many bullets
2860920	2862920	are going through you.
2862920	2864920	I spoke too many bullets.
2864920	2866920	He survived all those bullets.
2870920	2872920	He grabbed your dire horse.
2872920	2874920	Dire horse?
2874920	2876920	Banshee!
2876920	2878920	Iknu-i-ma-ya
2878920	2880920	Iknu-i-ma-ya
2880920	2882920	No idea who I'm supposed to see.
2882920	2884920	Iknu-i-ma-ya
2884920	2886920	Iknu-i-ma-ya
2886920	2888920	Sounds like I'm trying to say something in the dark.
2888920	2890920	I...
2890920	2892920	Iqalvanyu?
2892920	2894920	It's not Iqalvanyu.
2896920	2898920	Got anything better than bows and arrows?
2900920	2902920	Those are the only weapons they need.
2902920	2904920	Great. Good choice, Ryder.
2904920	2906920	Iknu-i-ma-ya.
2906920	2908920	Couldn't humans kill the main guys?
2908920	2910920	Human body in the machines?
2910920	2912920	Yes.
2912920	2914920	That's very true, but...
2914920	2916920	It was arranged that the...
2916920	2918920	Oh, look at her! We stunning on them!
2918920	2920920	Look at this, got a little outfit of the day moment check.
2920920	2922920	Oh, come on!
2922920	2924920	Look at my dual-wield blades!
2924920	2926920	Come on, that's so cool!
2926920	2928920	Oh, how did I hit?
2928920	2930920	Oh, that's so cool!
2930920	2932920	Come on, that's so cool.
2932920	2934920	I'm sorry, but look how cool that...
2934920	2936920	Oh my god, that's terrifying!
2936920	2938920	Imagine that running at you.
2938920	2940920	Oh, I just crap myself right there.
2940920	2942920	Your avatar isn't blonde
2942920	2944920	because blonde doesn't exist in Navi, I don't think.
2944920	2946920	Maybe it does, I don't know.
2946920	2948920	I don't think I recall seeing a blonde Navi.
2948920	2950920	Oh no, I do!
2950920	2952920	In the different regions of...
2952920	2954920	But we are jungle Navi.
2954920	2956920	This is jungle Navi.
2956920	2958920	There aren't, like, types of Navi
2958920	2960920	or jungle Navi.
2964920	2966920	Sadly, not closer to your level plus.
2980920	2982920	We need to win his approval.
2982920	2984920	Oh my god, she's so real for that.
2990920	2992920	Okay, we need to try and get the approval
2992920	2994920	of this guy.
2994920	2996920	Why?
2996920	2998920	I've already forgotten the plot,
2998920	3000920	but we're gonna do it anyway.
3000920	3002920	But basically, we are full Navi right now
3002920	3004920	and I'm gonna tell you some...
3004920	3006920	Okay, this really is a girls game
3006920	3008920	because every time we go to our next location
3008920	3010920	we unlock new outfits as we level up
3010920	3012920	and I get to, like, play a little wardrobe simulator.
3012920	3014920	Oh, such a girls game.
3020920	3022920	Yeah, he ain't happy at all to see me in.
3024920	3026920	Oh, I need to be able to ride a Banshee
3026920	3028920	or an Ekran, that's what they're called.
3028920	3030920	Traitor.
3030920	3032920	Oh my god.
3032920	3034920	Hold on, I need to be able to lay feet
3034920	3036920	because I'm hurting my legs against the table.
3036920	3038920	Did I just skip dialogue in that?
3039920	3041920	New outfits, let's go to the next area.
3041920	3043920	Oh my god, fashion simulator.
3043920	3045920	We played Landlord Simulator on Brotherhood.
3045920	3047920	Now we're playing fashion simulator on Avatar.
3050920	3052920	Right, we are about to learn
3052920	3054920	a motherfucking bow and arrow.
3056920	3058920	Oh, did not mean to do that one.
3058920	3060920	Let's try that again.
3060920	3062920	Pardon me, excuse me, that was very daft.
3062920	3064920	I just absolutely threw myself off the mat there.
3064920	3066920	How do I zoom in on the bow and arrow again?
3067920	3069920	Not that one.
3069920	3071920	Oh wow, it's just hold and release.
3071920	3073920	Okay, who would've thunk?
3073920	3075920	Who would've thunk, it's just hold and release.
3076920	3079920	The Navi's drip is indeed real true.
3079920	3082920	This game seems surprisingly competent, actually.
3082920	3084920	I was doubting, I get game.
3084920	3086920	Honestly, I get game.
3086920	3088920	Wait, what am I doing?
3088920	3091920	Oh, we're doing our first human kill.
3092920	3094920	Oh.
3094920	3096920	We are.
3096920	3098920	Yeah, the aim is very forgiving.
3098920	3100920	If you want an easy game,
3100920	3102920	definitely recommend this game.
3102920	3105920	The bow and arrow is very satisfactory.
3105920	3107920	But I'll tell you one thing though.
3107920	3109920	Oh look at this camera,
3109920	3111920	look how terrible this camera,
3111920	3113920	it like pings off of different,
3113920	3115920	like you can see the markers
3115920	3117920	of where they put the tracking to do that.
3117920	3119920	Like it's not smooth.
3120920	3122920	Oh my god, who goes there?
3124920	3126920	Identify yourself.
3130920	3133920	First human after killing two low level,
3133920	3136920	so actually true, I just recalled that.
3136920	3140920	Really willy-nilly killing over here.
3140920	3142920	Any willy killers?
3142920	3144920	No, don't.
3144920	3146920	This is another armor we can't get to unlock
3146920	3148920	about later on, it's not quite the same.
3149920	3152920	But here, we speak to Bower
3152920	3154920	a word for it.
3164920	3166920	Yeah.
3170920	3172920	The scale of the arrows are massive, they are.
3172920	3174920	Like Navi are so big.
3175920	3180920	So there wasn't a big tree in the game?
3180920	3183920	Oh, we aren't at the end of the game yet,
3183920	3185920	you just hold on to that though.
3185920	3187920	You're a couple of missions ahead,
3187920	3189920	but I like doing two things.
3195920	3198920	They don't disconnect us for treason, honestly.
3199920	3205920	She wants the braid tail?
3205920	3208920	What happens if we braid tails with each other?
3208920	3211920	Is that like a marriage proposal with Navi?
3219920	3221920	Oh, that's his wife? Oops.
3228920	3230920	What do you say?
3230920	3232920	To K?
3232920	3234920	Will you help us?
3234920	3236920	These boxes are explosives.
3236920	3238920	TNT?
3238920	3240920	Yes, we have word for this.
3240920	3242920	Kangangang.
3242920	3244920	Oh, that's so satisfying to say.
3244920	3246920	Kangangang!
3252920	3254920	I messed with that.
3254920	3256920	You can flip into the waterfall to get down here a bit faster
3257920	3260920	I will heal, but I shouldn't have done that.
3260920	3263920	I thought you could slip down without too much.
3263920	3267920	Oh, you have 50 bow and every time you get a sample,
3267920	3270920	you replenish your bow and arrow ammunition.
3270920	3273920	So all those green is more bows.
3275920	3278920	Genghis Khan? Okay, you're done.
3280920	3282920	Excuse me, pardon me, coming through,
3282920	3285920	you guys can't aim, oh I can't aim either, it's fine.
3285920	3289920	Okay, I think because my keyboard is registering,
3289920	3291920	hello?
3291920	3293920	Hello?
3293920	3296920	Okay, I think because my keyboard is registering,
3296920	3301920	the aim assist isn't being as active as it is normally
3301920	3307920	on Xbox, because I could have sworn I didn't even have to aim.
3308920	3314920	Oh, jeez, they just disappear.
3314920	3318920	Okay, we seem to get either 5 or 10 arrows from samples,
3318920	3321920	which is pretty good, I would say that's pretty good.
3321920	3323920	Kangangang.
3323920	3325920	Tanzu Simulator, actually.
3325920	3327920	I prefer the bow and arrows myself,
3327920	3330920	but I'll tell you something that's really sad about this game.
3330920	3336920	As we level up, our equipment also becomes stronger in nature, okay?
3336920	3341920	However, if you did not purchase the special edition,
3341920	3346920	which they made about 1000 copies of for some unknown reason,
3346920	3349920	if they didn't do the special, if you didn't buy it,
3349920	3352920	your bow does not one-shot the enemies as you level up,
3352920	3357920	it is complete nonsense, they made only so few copies.
3357920	3362920	I was like, oh do you see how that flower attack is attacking them,
3362920	3365920	and they're taking poison damage.
3365920	3370920	So unfortunately, our bow and arrow, I can't even see them through the...
3370920	3372920	Braw, why are you missing?
3372920	3374920	Braw.
3374920	3377920	You do heal over time naturally when there's no fight,
3377920	3380920	so you don't always have to spam heals, what's this?
3380920	3382920	What's that?
3382920	3384920	Ammo, I thought my ammo...
3384920	3387920	Whoa, wait, what do I have access to?
3387920	3392920	So dual wield, one big ass swing,
3392920	3394920	a gun and a bow, right?
3394920	3396920	I normally just stick the bow.
3396920	3398920	Very good.
3398920	3401920	Very good, very nice.
3401920	3405920	But overall, game is very forgiving.
3405920	3409920	If you're ever interested, we should do that, but that comes later.
3409920	3411920	We'll always come...
3411920	3414920	Oh, the acran just said bye to that,
3414920	3416920	I'm pretty sure they would have got mowed over,
3416920	3420920	but look, as long as they're happy, I'm happy.
3420920	3423920	So right now, we're picking up our boom, boom, gang of con.
3423920	3425920	Do you mind?
3425920	3426920	Where did you come from?
3426920	3429920	You weren't even there, you're such a liar.
3429920	3431920	You're lying to me.
3431920	3432920	Where are they?
3432920	3435920	I hear them.
3435920	3439920	Snape, and not Snape, I am low health, that's okay.
3439920	3442920	We're gonna heal up like that, she can heal up,
3442920	3443920	and then we're just gonna move...
3443920	3445920	Oh, we're not gonna move on to the next section,
3445920	3446920	we're gonna go invisible.
3446920	3448920	Oh, no we're not, why?
3448920	3451920	Can you still...
3451920	3453920	I don't know if you saw that, this Trippid,
3453920	3455920	those flies were attacking him,
3455920	3458920	like literally Pandora is so nice to you when you're napping.
3458920	3459920	I love it.
3459920	3462920	Oh, I hear them.
3462920	3463920	I...
3463920	3467920	Oh, so these are bombs that fly into you.
3467920	3471920	I'm pretty sure I heard a guy's voice though.
3471920	3474920	I'm like 99% sure I heard a guy saying they're out there,
3474920	3476920	but I didn't see it.
3476920	3478920	I love the way you say jaw wield.
3478920	3479920	Oh, no.
3479920	3481920	Wait, does it say differently?
3481920	3482920	Jew...
3482920	3484920	Jewel wield?
3484920	3486920	Jewel wield.
3486920	3488920	Jewel.
3488920	3491920	Pandora thinks humans are an infection.
3491920	3495920	They are, they're terrible.
3495920	3497920	When you play RDF, it's just as truly similar.
3497920	3501920	Oh, that's hilarious, honestly.
3501920	3503920	It's such a good game.
3503920	3505920	It's such a good game.
3505920	3508920	I love this game so much.
3508920	3511920	The only complaint I have about this game,
3511920	3515920	it was made when games like to do...
3515920	3516920	Why?
3516920	3519920	It's like I have to aim a little to the right.
3519920	3520920	I do.
3520920	3523920	I've aimed a little to the right.
3523920	3525920	We can go down or up.
3525920	3529920	My memory says up, question mark.
3529920	3532920	Jewel wield.
3532920	3534920	Jewel wield.
3534920	3538920	Well, my memory was correct.
3538920	3543920	Oh, he got a little ambitious with trying to hurt me there.
3543920	3544920	Where is this?
3544920	3545920	It's up there?
3545920	3546920	Oh, it might be up there.
3546920	3549920	Whoa, I just spotted you in the corner of my eye.
3549920	3552920	Yeah, these are literally, you know,
3552920	3553920	I don't know what they're called.
3553920	3556920	Those bombs that are for submarines under the water.
3556920	3557920	I don't know what their name is,
3557920	3561920	but that's what those are, but in the air.
3561920	3562920	Oh, I missed.
3562920	3567920	Yeah, the aim ball in this game, aim working.
3567920	3570920	Aim ball, please.
3570920	3572920	Wait, he didn't perish?
3572920	3575920	Jeez.
3575920	3577920	It looks like they're...
3577920	3579920	Oh, we need to shoot that.
3579920	3581920	Hold on.
3581920	3584920	Wait, do we actually?
3584920	3586920	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
3586920	3588920	Don't remember this part of the game.
3589920	3592920	What's the rocks for?
3592920	3594920	Am I to destroy these?
3594920	3597920	No way.
3597920	3600920	Yeah, so I'm using bullets too.
3600920	3603920	Aim ball, aim mort.
3603920	3606920	More like sense ball, aim mort.
3606920	3608920	Why?
3608920	3610920	The aim assist is not like me.
3610920	3613920	I'm not actually going to claim that tree of nature.
3613920	3614920	That's what...
3614920	3615920	Tree of nature.
3615920	3618920	Travel point because...
3618920	3619920	Holy crap.
3619920	3623920	Oh, no, I don't have unlimited ammo.
3623920	3627920	I thought I had unlimited ammo.
3627920	3628920	Jeez.
3628920	3630920	What did that do as a child that made...
3630920	3632920	It really must just be the aim assist.
3632920	3634920	Because I think if you all one-shot everything,
3634920	3636920	there's like no way this stuff is even hurting me.
3636920	3638920	Half as much.
3638920	3639920	Oh, I missed.
3639920	3641920	I shot, and I missed again.
3641920	3642920	And then I shot.
3642920	3644920	And then I missed again.
3644920	3645920	And again.
3645920	3647920	I don't know how to unshoot.
3647920	3648920	I can't pick up ammo from that.
3648920	3651920	I can only pick up ammo shells.
3651920	3654920	Honestly, let's see if we can get away with this.
3654920	3658920	Because we just need to pick up the package and then go.
3658920	3659920	Oh, wow.
3659920	3660920	Okay, cutscene time.
3660920	3661920	Cutscene time.
3661920	3663920	Whoa.
3663920	3665920	Gang gang gang.
3665920	3667920	Gang is gone.
3670920	3671920	Okay, let's get the heck out of here
3671920	3673920	because I don't want to get hurt
3673920	3674920	any more than we need to.
3674920	3677920	I heard that belief and I was going to go for it.
3677920	3680920	I think we're about to get an early crown.
3685920	3687920	Long story short, I missed.
3687920	3689920	Yeah, I missed a lot.
3689920	3690920	And then I shot.
3690920	3691920	And then I shot.
3691920	3693920	And then I missed again.
3694920	3696920	Thumb a right.
3697920	3698920	Oh.
3701920	3703920	Okay, we're about to climb.
3703920	3705920	Climb, climb, climb, climb.
3707920	3710920	Yeah, I think the campaign mode is roughly seven hours.
3710920	3713920	We could probably come back in 100% the sectors.
3713920	3716920	And we can also play this mini conquest game,
3716920	3718920	which actually I really enjoyed as a kid.
3718920	3721920	But you have to do it at the end of the game
3721920	3723920	for like 100% success rate.
3723920	3727920	There are Viper Wolves ahead,
3727920	3730920	but we're just going to be cheeky and do this.
3730920	3732920	And then we completely negate
3732920	3734920	even having to fight a lot of them.
3734920	3739920	Unfortunately, invisibility.
3739920	3744920	Invincibility is when they can't hurt you.
3744920	3748920	Invisibility is when they can't sneak.
3748920	3750920	It doesn't last forever,
3750920	3752920	but as we level up,
3752920	3755920	like, oh, actually, we're really close to leveling up.
3755920	3756920	I don't know if I should.
3756920	3758920	I don't want to hurt the wolves.
3758920	3760920	I don't want to hurt the wolves,
3760920	3761920	but I'll kill the humans.
3761920	3762920	No problem.
3762920	3763920	Yeah, no, that's fine.
3763920	3764920	That's fine.
3766920	3767920	Yeah, that thing, that thing.
3767920	3769920	It's friendly fire on.
3769920	3771920	No, you cannot hurt other navi.
3771920	3772920	Now that you're a navi side,
3772920	3775920	I assume it's the same if you pick RDA.
3775920	3777920	Oh, good snipe.
3777920	3779920	Oh, good snipe.
3780920	3784920	Okay, if I can take my time to, like, properly even.
3784920	3787920	No, I think I was out of range.
3787920	3789920	There is a range to your attacks.
3789920	3790920	Like, you can't...
3790920	3792920	No, no, I just suck.
3792920	3793920	There we go.
3793920	3796920	There is a range distance to your attacks.
3796920	3798920	I cannot for the life of the human.
3798920	3800920	Am I to go this way?
3802920	3804920	Am I to go this way?
3804920	3806920	No, classic dead end.
3806920	3808920	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
3808920	3809920	Mom, get the camera.
3809920	3811920	Play of the game, honestly.
3811920	3816920	Did you guys see that Marvel superhero, like, 5v5?
3817920	3819920	I hear a bomb.
3819920	3821920	I see a bomb.
3821920	3823920	Um, um, um, um, um.
3823920	3824920	I really don't want the bomb to get me.
3824920	3826920	Oh, I'm already out of invista.
3827920	3828920	And the bomb is chasing me.
3828920	3829920	Okay, we're doing it.
3829920	3830920	We're just going for it.
3830920	3831920	We're committing.
3831920	3833920	Did anyone play it?
3833920	3834920	Marvel rivals.
3834920	3835920	Yeah.
3835920	3837920	It looks so good.
3837920	3839920	Everyone was, like, dogging on it,
3839920	3842920	but I'm like, oh, I actually really enjoyed the look of it.
3846920	3849920	I'm installing the game now just to kill the Navi.
3849920	3850920	You know what?
3850920	3851920	You're done.
3852920	3853920	You're done.
3854920	3856920	I'm definitely going to play Marvel Overwatch when it comes out.
3856920	3859920	Yeah, and then wasn't there not another company
3859920	3862920	that came out with another Overwatch-style game?
3862920	3865920	I think development teams literally watched,
3865920	3867920	like, the mess up in real time.
3867920	3869920	I don't know if that thing's still chasing me, but...
3872920	3873920	There is another one.
3873920	3875920	Yeah, like Scarlet Witch's Moira and all that.
3875920	3876920	Yeah.
3876920	3877920	I used to play a lot of Overwatch.
3877920	3879920	I actually really enjoyed the game,
3879920	3881920	but I just don't play it anymore.
3881920	3884920	Like, I don't find it rewarding or...
3885920	3886920	Which is such a shame,
3886920	3889920	because I've poured a lot of hours into that game.
3891920	3894920	But I would absolutely love if we could do Marvel rivals together.
3894920	3896920	It's like a stream snag game, like...
3897920	3900920	I don't know how the accounts work,
3900920	3903920	but I'm like 99% sure I can make a dummy account
3903920	3906920	and then, like, add user's friends
3906920	3909920	and then make note of who's, like, played
3909920	3911920	and then just rotate between, like, kind of what we...
3911920	3912920	Oh, here we go.
3912920	3913920	Level up.
3913920	3914920	What did I unlock?
3914920	3915920	Let's see.
3916920	3918920	Bam knee pack.
3918920	3921920	We have a club weapon with fricking spears on it
3921920	3923920	or another type of RDA gun.
3924920	3926920	Oh, and a shot and a missed.
3926920	3928920	Oh, and a missed again.
3928920	3930920	I can hear an enemy.
3930920	3931920	I don't see him.
3931920	3932920	Oh, there he is.
3936920	3938920	That wasn't him that said that.
3938920	3940920	Oh well, whatever, whatever.
3942920	3944920	Blizzard is horrible with their IPs yet.
3944920	3947920	Time to go back to Team Fortress 2, honestly.
3948920	3951920	But I could have sworn I saw another development team
3951920	3953920	come out with something that was similar
3953920	3955920	out to the format as well.
3955920	3957920	So I think literally everyone watched,
3957920	3959920	Overwatch 2 come out
3959920	3962920	and as soon as Jeff Kaplan left the development team,
3962920	3965920	I think everyone behind the scenes
3965920	3967920	knew what on Earth was up
3967920	3969920	and knew it was, like, essentially going to flop
3969920	3974920	due to the change in gameplay.
3974920	3978920	But when Marvel Rivals does come out,
3978920	3981920	because I think it's in beta right now,
3981920	3983920	or I may be wrong,
3983920	3985920	but I'm happy to make a dummy account.
3985920	3987920	We'll make it a multiplayer game
3987920	3991920	and we'll just kind of add...
3991920	3993920	I think it's 5v5, so it means four reeflings
3993920	3995920	and myself can play at the same time
3995920	3997920	against just randomers.
3997920	4000920	We'll, like, play actual public match games
4000920	4003920	unless you guys really wanted to go against each other.
4003920	4005920	I'm not sure having me and your team
4005920	4007920	will be a good idea, though,
4007920	4009920	because I'm not very strong at the game
4009920	4011920	and I can't play it.
4011920	4013920	But if that's something you guys are down for,
4013920	4015920	I'm heking down for it as well.
4015920	4018920	Obviously, we'll remove everyone
4018920	4020920	at the end of the gaming session
4020920	4022920	and restart fresh.
4022920	4024920	As I said, it'll be...
4024920	4026920	I saw that...
4026920	4028920	I don't know if I'm going to get...
4028920	4030920	Right, I'm backing off, I'm backing off.
4030920	4032920	I don't think...
4032920	4034920	We don't take that down yet.
4034920	4037920	No, that part comes later on.
4038920	4040920	I didn't...
4040920	4042920	No, I'm going to pick this up.
4042920	4044920	There we go.
4044920	4046920	Team Landers, Johnny.
4046920	4048920	Should I tell everyone what to do?
4048920	4050920	Protect me! Heal me! Heal me!
4050920	4052920	I used to play Zarya,
4052920	4054920	which is an offensive tank
4054920	4056920	in...
4056920	4058920	Overwatch.
4058920	4060920	Oh my god, they're so beautiful!
4060920	4062920	I love...
4062920	4064920	The music's changed.
4065920	4067920	Oh, they're so beautiful.
4067920	4069920	The Ikran.
4070920	4072920	Look at them all judging me.
4072920	4074920	That's okay, you can judge me.
4074920	4077920	Look at them, they're so pretty!
4078920	4081920	Hello, please don't attack me.
4083920	4085920	They're so beautiful.
4088920	4090920	Please understand, this game's a little old,
4090920	4092920	which is why they're all the same color.
4092920	4094920	Please forgive, please forgive.
4094920	4097920	But I assume the new avatar is really beautiful.
4099920	4101920	My Ikran literally almost made me perish
4101920	4104920	and then said, yeah, alright, I'll pick you up.
4104920	4106920	I got pranked by it.
4106920	4108920	I literally done a little pranky on me.
4108920	4110920	A little pranky-wanky.
4110920	4112920	No, no.
4114920	4116920	It's not a good look, honestly.
4116920	4118920	I mean, you would really choose
4118920	4120920	match over...
4120920	4122920	Pickle over the big birdie?
4122920	4124920	Exactly.
4124920	4126920	Why don't you pick?
4126920	4128920	Oh, look at us, we're soaring.
4128920	4130920	We're soaring.
4130920	4132920	We're soaring.
4132920	4134920	We're soaring.
4134920	4136920	We're soaring.
4136920	4138920	We're soaring.
4138920	4140920	We're soaring.
4140920	4142920	We're soaring.
4142920	4144920	We're soaring.
4144920	4146920	We're soaring.
4146920	4148920	Wee!
4148920	4150920	Oh, ouch, ouch.
4150920	4152920	Sorry, your wing, your wing.
4152920	4154920	My apologies, sorry.
4156920	4158920	I didn't mean to hurt your wing, little Banshee.
4158920	4160920	But thank you for being so forgiving.
4160920	4162920	We're just flying through the map now.
4162920	4164920	Banshee's have an insane HP.
4164920	4166920	We will be shot at as we go around.
4166920	4168920	I don't know if you read that really quickly.
4168920	4170920	It said lifting the fog, 50%.
4170920	4172920	Don't worry.
4172920	4174920	Oh, we really need to get some height.
4174920	4176920	Oh, I'm going to do a little cheeky 360
4176920	4178920	to get that height there.
4178920	4180920	We are about to reach the ceiling in this game.
4180920	4182920	We are about to reach the ceiling in this game.
4182920	4184920	We are about to reach the ceiling in this game.
4184920	4186920	We are about to reach the ceiling in this game.
4186920	4188920	Alright, climb, climb.
4188920	4190920	Jeez, this map has a lot of verticality.
4190920	4192920	Definitely did not remember that.
4192920	4194920	But yes, there was a sector challenge
4194920	4196920	that says lifting the fog.
4196920	4198920	There's a few sector challenges.
4198920	4200920	Depending on how long the campaign takes,
4202920	4204920	we might actually just 100%
4204920	4206920	all the sections.
4206920	4208920	Excuse me, game.
4210920	4212920	I know for a fact I flew over that.
4216920	4218920	Would you like to register me flying through this?
4218920	4220920	No? Oh, okay.
4220920	4222920	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
4222920	4224920	Woman moment.
4224920	4226920	Okay, there we go.
4226920	4228920	There we go, you got it in the end.
4228920	4230920	Whee! I'm sure this is
4230920	4232920	really beautiful cinematic.
4232920	4234920	Oh, we got it. Okay, but we're hitting that rock.
4234920	4236920	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
4236920	4238920	Look, the camera angle isn't...
4238920	4240920	It's not that easy to freaking dive, dive!
4240920	4242920	Alright, then go up, go up, go up.
4242920	4244920	There we go.
4244920	4246920	But yes, Banshee
4246920	4248920	are a really good way to get around these maps.
4248920	4250920	Whoa, whoa, easy, easy, easy.
4250920	4252920	And we are back to the start
4252920	4254920	where we started.
4254920	4256920	Look at us going.
4256920	4258920	Isn't that beautiful?
4258920	4260920	Okay, I am going to say
4260920	4262920	before we start this next quest
4262920	4264920	there is a
4264920	4266920	voice line that repeats consistently
4266920	4268920	through this mission. I will try to get through as fast
4268920	4270920	as possible. It is so annoying.
4270920	4272920	It is so annoying.
4272920	4274920	Genuinely so annoying.
4274920	4276920	Horrifically annoying.
4276920	4278920	Unless this isn't
4278920	4280920	the mission.
4284920	4286920	Don't say that.
4294920	4296920	Maybe this isn't the mission I thought it was.
4302920	4304920	Audio bug is the worst.
4304920	4306920	Is that Ubisoft game? It has to be.
4308920	4310920	The animals slowly regretting letting you
4310920	4312920	drive them, honestly. Okay, no, it's after
4312920	4314920	this mission. They are really annoying when it pops up.
4314920	4316920	What did we unlock?
4316920	4318920	A crossbow
4318920	4320920	and some sort of ability.
4320920	4322920	Hold on.
4322920	4324920	How do I open that?
4324920	4326920	Skills?
4326920	4328920	Kinetic Dash, Ewa's Breath
4328920	4330920	Titan Bash I don't really use.
4330920	4332920	We could maybe replace it
4332920	4334920	with
4334920	4336920	Calls of Hyperwolf to your side.
4336920	4338920	It will fight for you for a short time.
4338920	4340920	That is pretty cool.
4340920	4342920	Death by Bees.
4342920	4344920	What the heck am I supposed to do?
4344920	4346920	I completely forgot.
4346920	4348920	We are going to raid Ikran.
4348920	4350920	Can I go on you?
4350920	4352920	Okay.
4352920	4354920	Oh, he is going forward.
4354920	4356920	I never really...
4356920	4358920	Breath!
4360920	4362920	I see you after work.
4364920	4366920	Thank you, Tiny Spiny.
4366920	4368920	I appreciate the tip.
4368920	4370920	I did look it up.
4370920	4372920	I said the game takes around 7 hours
4372920	4374920	to complete. If we come back and do section stuff...
4374920	4376920	Wait, where am I?
4376920	4378920	I'll land.
4378920	4380920	I think I'll land up here.
4380920	4382920	It looks like I'm definitely to land to keep
4382920	4384920	Ikran safe up here.
4384920	4386920	You stay there, buddy.
4386920	4388920	You be nice and safe.
4388920	4390920	Have a good day at work. Thanks for hanging.
4390920	4392920	I appreciate it. I appreciate the tip.
4392920	4394920	Support it.
4394920	4396920	I'm not to say donations because it's not a donation.
4396920	4398920	Actually, I don't know
4398920	4400920	if I'm supposed to update the girls
4400920	4402920	as things to be like...
4402920	4404920	You know how you're supposed to put
4404920	4406920	a disclaimer on the freaking thing
4406920	4408920	in case someone does a charge back?
4408920	4410920	Right.
4410920	4412920	I'm 99% sure these guys
4412920	4414920	just keep respawning.
4414920	4416920	So I'm actually not
4416920	4418920	to fuss...
4418920	4420920	Do you mind? Thank you.
4420920	4422920	I'm not to fuss
4422920	4424920	for completely clearing up this section.
4426920	4428920	Uh...
4428920	4430920	Am I to beat it up?
4430920	4432920	Oh, it's a bomb!
4432920	4434920	It's a bomb!
4434920	4436920	Okay, there we go. Let's go up.
4436920	4438920	Is that about to blow up right next to me?
4438920	4440920	Oh, I didn't...
4440920	4442920	Kill guys don't look at explosions.
4442920	4444920	You know the drill, okay?
4444920	4446920	Kill guys don't look at explosions.
4446920	4448920	Wait, you mean stream elements
4448920	4450920	is intact?
4450920	4452920	If someone does
4452920	4454920	a disclaimer for charge back
4454920	4456920	I'll probably edit the motor then.
4456920	4458920	Or when a girl...
4458920	4460920	I don't know, I get tired.
4460920	4462920	Oh, I have a fantastic
4462920	4464920	update for
4464920	4466920	scripts. Oh my goodness.
4466920	4468920	So the script manager
4468920	4470920	now has access
4470920	4472920	and is taking over
4472920	4474920	and look
4474920	4476920	so everyone has
4476920	4478920	a four-part series coming out
4478920	4480920	like a story that kind of progresses.
4480920	4482920	Um...
4482920	4484920	Shebe's four-part series
4484920	4486920	is currently being written right now.
4486920	4488920	I'm not trying to say anything
4488920	4490920	but good luck trying to hold it together
4490920	4492920	when she performs that script
4492920	4494920	because
4494920	4496920	wow, I was blown away.
4496920	4498920	I'm like, there's definitely
4498920	4500920	something to be said about
4500920	4502920	a guy writing a script versus what I could write
4502920	4504920	because I just...
4504920	4506920	I like challenging myself
4506920	4508920	and in general I know what
4508920	4510920	overall you'd like us
4510920	4512920	to say type thing
4512920	4514920	but I have to admit, I was like
4514920	4516920	oh my god, there's not gonna be
4516920	4518920	any...anyone left in the
4518920	4520920	sack after that one.
4520920	4522920	And that was part one I read. I didn't even read
4522920	4524920	the finalized series of it.
4524920	4526920	Azur's one is being
4526920	4528920	worked on next.
4528920	4530920	Um...Oh my god!
4530920	4532920	Sorry!
4532920	4534920	I wasn't paying attention to how many
4534920	4536920	bad guys are there. Right, we're gonna watch the
4536920	4538920	explosion this time because we can.
4538920	4540920	What's the explosion look like?
4540920	4542920	Okay, it was just kind of out of control.
4542920	4544920	Oh no, the terror does go down! Okay, I like it.
4544920	4546920	I wonder if we can get some
4546920	4548920	XP for destroying this.
4548920	4550920	Ow! Okay, we can
4550920	4552920	get XP for doing that.
4552920	4554920	I think? Why did...
4554920	4556920	Uh, Azur's
4556920	4558920	story...
4558920	4560920	I don't know if I should ruin what the story is.
4560920	4562920	Like, I don't want to like
4562920	4564920	tell stuff that's kind of like exciting for
4564920	4566920	girls.
4566920	4568920	But, like, I like
4568920	4570920	the four-part series ideas. Like,
4570920	4572920	Emmys one, I really like.
4572920	4574920	No, don't spoil it. Okay, I won't spoil it.
4574920	4576920	Um...Oh, there's a home
4576920	4578920	tree right there, actually. I don't know if I should
4578920	4580920	grab it then. Actually, no, I have
4580920	4582920	access to the Ikran to fly
4582920	4584920	around the map so it's not gonna be that big of
4584920	4586920	a deal of us coming back.
4586920	4588920	Newbie would begin
4588920	4590920	a work is a lot, so I
4590920	4592920	was good job as well. Yes, I like...So
4592920	4594920	now that, like, the scripts are no longer my problem,
4594920	4596920	I get to
4596920	4598920	focus on making the girl short,
4598920	4600920	so Mercy came out with a short and she
4600920	4602920	was like, do you...Do you think
4602920	4604920	I should have been blonde senpai and showed, like, behind the scenes artwork?
4604920	4606920	I'm gonna get everyone
4606920	4608920	to do that to show their concept art.
4608920	4610920	Like, me as well, actually, I need to write the
4610920	4612920	scripts. And, like, I get
4612920	4614920	to work on that kind of fun stuff
4614920	4616920	instead of kind of, like,
4616920	4618920	being stretched too far.
4618920	4620920	Like...
4620920	4622920	It's too easy. It's too easy.
4622920	4624920	I'm not even gonna say it's that easy.
4624920	4626920	Um...
4626920	4628920	You can go as well, because you were shooting
4628920	4630920	my Ikran. You're not supposed to
4630920	4632920	shoot my Ikran.
4632920	4634920	Um...
4634920	4636920	I'm literally...Spoilershine is always the beginning for...
4636920	4638920	Literally, I...
4638920	4640920	I get so excited about everything that's planned
4640920	4642920	behind the scenes, that I'm like, oh,
4642920	4644920	I don't want to ruin it for the girls.
4644920	4646920	Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,
4646920	4648920	wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,
4648920	4650920	sorry, sorry. I'm too busy rambling.
4650920	4652920	I'm not even actually focusing on the dang game play.
4652920	4654920	Stop!
4654920	4656920	Okay, legit.
4656920	4658920	Wait! Oh, no!
4658920	4660920	We don't one-shot them anymore. They've gotten too
4660920	4662920	strong now. That's the problem.
4662920	4664920	If you don't, like, um...
4664920	4666920	Farm XP,
4666920	4668920	you will fall behind.
4670920	4672920	Concept art was great to see.
4672920	4674920	Yes, so I get to, like, kind of do that fun
4674920	4676920	behind-the-scenes script stuff, like,
4676920	4678920	shorts for the girls.
4678920	4680920	Um...
4680920	4682920	Also,
4682920	4684920	super gracious thank you
4684920	4686920	to everyone who
4686920	4688920	is using YouTube clip
4688920	4690920	feature for the girls.
4690920	4692920	If you didn't know,
4692920	4694920	if I go on their stream, I can see
4694920	4696920	who and what has been clipped.
4696920	4698920	I just want to say,
4698920	4700920	there's actually quite a few people
4700920	4702920	who are clipping my burps at the moment.
4702920	4704920	I might unironically make a
4704920	4706920	15-minute burp compilation, just for the heck
4706920	4708920	of it, and call it, like, strong burps for
4708920	4710920	14 minutes and 53 seconds.
4710920	4712920	Just for the heck of it,
4712920	4714920	because it seems to be
4714920	4716920	something a few
4716920	4718920	gentlemen seem to enjoy, and, you know, I'm not
4718920	4720920	here to ruin anyone's day.
4720920	4722920	But yes, please do consider
4722920	4724920	clipping. We have a really funny
4724920	4726920	short of Icy
4726920	4728920	coming soon.
4728920	4730920	Our second clipper
4730920	4732920	we're kind of testing them out.
4732920	4734920	I don't have a problem, because they've already had
4734920	4736920	extensive clip history, but
4736920	4738920	they're busy at the moment, so the clips are
4738920	4740920	a wee bit slow to be produced.
4740920	4742920	But we're getting there, we're getting there, so
4742920	4744920	thank you to anyone who uses YouTube clip feature
4744920	4746920	to help out.
4746920	4748920	A short of Icy doing what?
4748920	4750920	So it's already happened, so it's not a
4750920	4752920	spoiler.
4752920	4754920	But Icy, basically, when
4754920	4756920	in her adorable voice,
4756920	4758920	I'm not very smart,
4758920	4760920	and then she went, thank you so
4760920	4762920	much, Mike, honey
4762920	4764920	for donating to me
4764920	4766920	in her adorable frickin accent.
4766920	4768920	And I'm like, Icy,
4768920	4770920	Icicle, should I
4770920	4772920	have taught you that? Should I have said to
4772920	4774920	you
4774920	4776920	what that means?
4776920	4778920	So we're going to, we're going to get
4778920	4780920	turned into a clip, and I'll be sure on her
4780920	4782920	thing.
4782920	4784920	But her accent is so frickin adorable. Okay, I'm
4784920	4786920	going to bed. Rest well, see you in the
4786920	4788920	morning when you wake up.
4788920	4790920	I love seeing that. I love seeing that
4790920	4792920	whenever you guys are like, okay, I need to go
4792920	4794920	to work or I need to go to sleep. I'll see you
4794920	4796920	in the morning, see you in the morning. Oh yeah,
4796920	4798920	I'll see you after work, yeah, yeah. Oh, you
4798920	4800920	need to go out and do some errands, I'll see
4800920	4802920	you after that, I'll still be on. Right, this
4802920	4804920	is the scene.
4804920	4806920	The quote is, Raider, you have got to
4806920	4808920	get to higher ground. It will be repeated
4808920	4810920	a ridiculous amount
4810920	4812920	of times.
4812920	4814920	Yep, I remember the quote, I've not even
4814920	4816920	played this game in many a year, Raider,
4816920	4818920	you have got to get to higher grounds, it
4818920	4820920	will repeat, and I'm like, did no one play
4820920	4822920	test this? Did no one
4822920	4824920	see what an issue this is?
4824920	4826920	Because I've gone the wrong way.
4826920	4828920	I've gone the wrong way.
4828920	4830920	I'm gonna part myself.
4830920	4832920	Right, let's hurry this up
4832920	4834920	through this section.
4834920	4836920	Ah! Oh my god, imagine
4836920	4838920	that coming out, yeah, I would actually
4838920	4840920	be so terrified. Shawnee,
4840920	4842920	you've got to get to higher ground, honestly!
4842920	4844920	Get that
4844920	4846920	done. Get that
4846920	4848920	done.
4848920	4850920	Right, we destroy one
4850920	4852920	way.
4852920	4854920	Oh, I love it. Love it.
4854920	4856920	Special, what's right? Oh no,
4856920	4858920	what's my special?
4862920	4864920	I don't know what button the special
4864920	4866920	is though. Yes, we spawn at checkpoint.
4866920	4868920	It's putting, it's giving me keyboard
4868920	4870920	input, but I'm playing mouse in control,
4870920	4872920	like I don't know if you can hear my analog stick.
4872920	4874920	Let's give that another try.
4874920	4876920	That was a bit daft.
4876920	4878920	I do apologize
4878920	4880920	for that MLG game. I'm going the wrong way
4880920	4882920	again.
4882920	4884920	I can't all be good
4884920	4886920	at video games.
4886920	4888920	Literally, wherever
4888920	4890920	nine-year-old me is inside my head right
4890920	4892920	now, can you come
4892920	4894920	and help us out here? Because this is getting
4894920	4896920	very good. This is getting embarrassing.
4896920	4898920	Right, I'm going
4898920	4900920	to click the analog sticks this time
4900920	4902920	to see if that's what the special
4902920	4904920	is instead.
4904920	4906920	Right, special, analog,
4906920	4908920	nope, that's,
4908920	4910920	nope, that's scan.
4910920	4912920	What would
4912920	4914920	R be?
4914920	4916920	You know what, I'm just going to hit R on my keyboard.
4922920	4924920	No!
4924920	4926920	Don't throw me, it's so...
4926920	4928920	Wait, why is this not breaking?
4928920	4930920	Is there a health bar? Oh, there is!
4930920	4932920	Is it glitched
4932920	4934920	out?
4934920	4936920	I can see that health bar, that little green.
4936920	4938920	What's going on?
4940920	4942920	Thank you for the tip, analog.
4942920	4944920	Wait, I think it's glitched out.
4944920	4946920	This is an old game, hold on.
4946920	4948920	Let me do this.
4948920	4950920	I'll do it with a bigger one.
4950920	4952920	Uh...
4952920	4954920	Game?
4954920	4956920	Game, you're showing your time.
4956920	4958920	I've never actually had it glitched out
4958920	4960920	here before.
4968920	4970920	Right.
4970920	4972920	I had to press F on the keyboard.
4972920	4974920	I don't know what button I was supposed to press
4974920	4976920	on the freaking...
4976920	4978920	I'm sorry, oh, it keeps saying it.
4978920	4980920	Literally, right where you've got to get to
4980920	4982920	higher ground.
4982920	4984920	I literally F in the chat, that's...
4984920	4986920	Oh!
4986920	4988920	Oh, you're getting worked, mate.
4988920	4990920	Oh, then you fall now.
4994920	4996920	Oh, he's hiding in the freaking bushes.
4996920	4998920	Right, healing up, healing up, healing up.
4998920	5000920	Don't worry, don't worry.
5000920	5002920	Actually, I think these are much faster.
5002920	5004920	Yeah, these are one shot.
5004920	5006920	The dual wield is one shot,
5006920	5008920	but the long stick isn't one shot.
5010920	5012920	What does that mean?
5012920	5014920	Right, okay,
5014920	5016920	we're just going to press the keyboard.
5016920	5018920	We're literally just switching between the keyboard
5018920	5020920	and the ticket thing. I don't know what I'm supposed to press.
5022920	5024920	Get worked for free, must be nice.
5024920	5026920	Steady on, are you?
5026920	5028920	Should we watch her by any chance?
5030920	5032920	Right, down we go.
5032920	5034920	I don't know.
5034920	5036920	Are you squinting me right now?
5036920	5038920	Beijingle!
5038920	5040920	Stop!
5040920	5042920	No, I'm getting trolled.
5042920	5044920	Thank you for the tip.
5044920	5046920	He repeats it so much,
5046920	5048920	but he's not doing it right now.
5048920	5050920	I wonder because...
5050920	5052920	I don't know why he's not repeating it.
5052920	5054920	But I kid you not,
5054920	5056920	he constantly repeats,
5056920	5058920	you have got to get to higher ground.
5058920	5060920	You have got to get to higher ground.
5060920	5062920	Over and over and over and over.
5062920	5064920	But, I think we're actually
5064920	5066920	being given...
5066920	5068920	Oh, objective control.
5068920	5070920	The classic three
5070920	5072920	and done in video games.
5072920	5074920	If aint broke, don't fix it.
5074920	5076920	Do this thing three times
5076920	5078920	and you win.
5078920	5080920	Delicious.
5080920	5082920	Delicious, delicious, delicious.
5082920	5084920	Love it.
5084920	5086920	I love it when game devs get the memory.
5088920	5090920	Oh my god, I'm inside that!
5090920	5092920	I'm inside it! Leave a load!
5092920	5094920	No!
5096920	5098920	Oh no.
5098920	5100920	I'm a...
5100920	5102920	Oh, that's not good.
5102920	5104920	I'm having a seizure.
5108920	5110920	Home tree!
5110920	5112920	Wait a minute.
5112920	5114920	I think I might have died
5114920	5116920	and now I'm at home tree
5116920	5118920	and I'm about to be spiritually be a Navi.
5118920	5120920	I'm physically about to be
5120920	5122920	100% Navi
5122920	5124920	if I remember correctly.
5128920	5130920	Oh yeah, that's right.
5130920	5132920	Oh, I can feel myself connecting
5132920	5134920	with nature.
5136920	5138920	Ah, she...
5148920	5150920	Oh...
5150920	5152920	I find this so cool.
5152920	5154920	Are you kidding me right now?
5158920	5160920	Heck yeah, speak for the trees.
5160920	5162920	Thank you, Tim Show.
5162920	5164920	For the tip. I can never say that right.
5164920	5166920	Shuttle.
5170920	5172920	Eywa just resurrected me
5172920	5174920	and Eywa's word is truth.
5174920	5176920	So I will not be taking any
5176920	5178920	contesting points that I'm no
5178920	5180920	a Navi anymore.
5182920	5184920	Actually, I really
5184920	5186920	enjoyed the second Avatar movie
5186920	5188920	because what's her name?
5188920	5190920	The one that is
5190920	5192920	Sigourney Weaver as a child?
5192920	5194920	I really like her plot line.
5196920	5198920	Eywa, that she's like
5198920	5200920	she can commune with Eywa.
5200920	5202920	I really like her.
5202920	5204920	Avatar Stoney has
5204920	5206920	an arrow under her hair.
5210920	5212920	There's a second Avatar movie?
5212920	5214920	Yeah, it's called We of the Water.
5216920	5218920	Did you not get advertised
5218920	5220920	on anything?
5222920	5224920	There's a second Avatar movie.
5224920	5226920	It's out right now.
5226920	5228920	I may have just spoiled it for you.
5228920	5230920	I apologize.
5230920	5232920	Eat.
5232920	5234920	If I was home tree,
5234920	5236920	I would tell Stoney to
5236920	5238920	If I was the home tree,
5238920	5240920	I would tell Stoney to
5240920	5242920	I don't know what he want.
5242920	5244920	What are you on about?
5246920	5248920	What are you on about?
5248920	5250920	This is a spiritual location.
5250920	5252920	You can't
5252920	5254920	loot the home tree.
5254920	5256920	Okay, I say that as if
5256920	5258920	there is an agenda concept right now
5258920	5260920	that may or may not have
5260920	5262920	have some non-influenced playing.
5264920	5266920	You cannot
5266920	5268920	do any activated mission things.
5268920	5270920	Oh, it's the guy.
5272920	5274920	Nothing but more than pure
5274920	5276920	agenda.
5278920	5280920	My new abandoned name.
5282920	5284920	Advertising for the second movie was
5284920	5286920	a booze ball.
5286920	5288920	It still did really well, did it not?
5288920	5290920	If I'm not mistaken.
5290920	5292920	Are you underestimating the power?
5296920	5298920	You acting like the tree?
5298920	5300920	Well, it's the Holy Spirit
5300920	5302920	of Navi.
5302920	5304920	Okay, we are going to
5304920	5306920	Swatulu.
5306920	5308920	Anyone else
5308920	5310920	visited Swatulu?
5310920	5312920	Maybe on spring break you went to Swatulu?
5312920	5314920	Yeah, they are absolutely wrecking
5314920	5316920	this place.
5316920	5318920	This is not
5318920	5320920	this area
5320920	5322920	is definitely getting absolutely wrecked.
5324920	5326920	I just remembered what happens
5326920	5328920	in this area. I'm like night and impotenture.
5332920	5334920	Very good location because something very
5334920	5336920	cool happens.
5336920	5338920	Storm and Scythe.
5342920	5344920	No, actually I think it's a later level.
5344920	5346920	You know that?
5346920	5348920	Anyway, let's go.
5348920	5350920	The first movie itself
5350920	5352920	was already advertised enough for the second
5352920	5354920	that's probably what they said.
5354920	5356920	That was
5356920	5358920	really outrageous
5358920	5360920	writer. I'm going to be honest.
5360920	5362920	Say no hablo
5362920	5364920	to a Navi.
5364920	5366920	I don't know, that felt a bit weird
5366920	5368920	to me. I don't think we should let that one slide.
5368920	5370920	That was
5370920	5372920	that was motivated.
5372920	5374920	That was bizarre.
5374920	5376920	And if you're
5376920	5378920	literally fully Navi, you're not going to put
5378920	5380920	that on the screen.
5380920	5382920	And if you're
5382920	5384920	literally fully Navi, you're not going to put
5384920	5386920	effort into speaking Navi.
5386920	5388920	We're going to unlock the home vision tree.
5388920	5390920	What the heck is that?
5392920	5394920	Oh, it's a tree of vision. Oh, it's a sector
5394920	5396920	challenge. Okay.
5396920	5398920	Am I crazy
5398920	5400920	or was there a horse I could ride back
5400920	5402920	here?
5402920	5404920	Thank you, Child Me,
5404920	5406920	for remembering.
5406920	5408920	Oh my god, I'm actually so smart.
5408920	5410920	You're just menacingly
5410920	5412920	guarding this horse. Can I just take it?
5412920	5414920	Thanks mate. Appreciate it.
5414920	5416920	Hey,
5416920	5418920	hablo español
5418920	5420920	sí, señorita.
5420920	5422920	Te amo.
5422920	5424920	¿Qué pasa?
5424920	5426920	¿Dónde
5426920	5428920	está la biblioteca?
5428920	5430920	There are
5430920	5432920	RDA, but the beautiful thing
5432920	5434920	about these parts of the map
5434920	5436920	you can ignore it.
5436920	5438920	You can just zoom ahead.
5438920	5440920	This is one of those games where
5440920	5442920	if you want to take your time and explore it
5442920	5444920	you most certainly can, but if you just
5444920	5446920	want to be like, right, I want to do the objective
5446920	5448920	meee, I don't want to leave the horse
5448920	5450920	in the middle here. What am I doing here?
5450920	5452920	Oh no, I don't want my horse to
5452920	5454920	wait, investigate. Oh, I'm only to do a
5454920	5456920	drive-by? Oh, I can do a drive-by
5456920	5458920	shooting alright, don't mind me.
5458920	5460920	Oh, let's go.
5462920	5464920	Right, I don't think you can shoot
5464920	5466920	well on horseback. Sorry,
5466920	5468920	dire horse, it's called dire horse.
5468920	5470920	But yes, I don't mind
5470920	5472920	doing a drive-by.
5472920	5474920	Right, left or right,
5474920	5476920	both are terrible.
5476920	5478920	This one's a dead end, so do the
5478920	5480920	dead end first and then come back for the open one
5480920	5482920	because it's likely
5482920	5484920	that the open will be like the next
5484920	5486920	progression.
5486920	5488920	Oh, my wee horse is getting
5488920	5490920	injured.
5490920	5492920	Shattered village, yeah,
5492920	5494920	looks absolutely desolate.
5494920	5496920	Okay, I think the game's
5496920	5498920	putting horses around the map in case
5498920	5500920	we do end up losing.
5500920	5502920	Can you feel like Sample's on horseback? You cannot.
5502920	5504920	Flexing them,
5504920	5506920	rolling arse.
5506920	5508920	What do you mean you cannot roll your arse?
5508920	5510920	Can you not
5510920	5512920	iterate what you wish to
5512920	5514920	rock on?
5514920	5516920	I just started shoving arse and words that
5516920	5518920	don't even have it. Oh, my poor horse.
5518920	5520920	Oh, it's a mech, it's a mech, it's a mech,
5520920	5522920	oh, the horse is going to perish.
5522920	5524920	Oh, no, the horse is perishing this game.
5524920	5526920	I don't like it here.
5526920	5528920	Let's get out of this place.
5530920	5532920	Is this the first
5532920	5534920	game? It is. This is not the new game
5534920	5536920	that came out. This is the
5536920	5538920	Archaic 2009
5538920	5540920	game.
5542920	5544920	Lunguri is not here.
5544920	5546920	Where is Lunguri?
5546920	5548920	Lunguri, where are you, mate?
5548920	5550920	I need to find Lunguri.
5552920	5554920	Any Lunguri fans?
5554920	5556920	I'm a Lunguri fan.
5556920	5558920	Oh, the horse is getting
5558920	5560920	in a loop.
5564920	5566920	With Unipee.
5566920	5568920	That's right, Riflin.
5568920	5570920	Unipee.
5570920	5572920	Oh, Unipee is a person.
5574920	5576920	Oh, what did we unlock?
5576920	5578920	Let's see.
5578920	5580920	The Onato Pack.
5580920	5582920	What is that?
5582920	5584920	That looks like shards from the sky.
5584920	5586920	That looked cool.
5586920	5588920	I've not actually summoned a horse.
5588920	5590920	What was that, birds from the sky?
5590920	5592920	Call on Pandora to help strike.
5592920	5594920	Oh, my god.
5594920	5596920	Hold on, what does it look like?
5600920	5602920	Okay, okay, okay, little baby.
5602920	5604920	Little baby clangs.
5604920	5606920	Okay, great.
5606920	5608920	We can go through here.
5608920	5610920	Oh!
5610920	5612920	I'm getting shot at.
5612920	5614920	Or is he shooting at an NPC?
5614920	5616920	I don't know. Hello, do you need assistance?
5620920	5622920	She just expired.
5622920	5624920	I don't know. I don't even speak Navi.
5624920	5626920	I don't even know what her last words were.
5626920	5628920	Oh, my god.
5628920	5630920	Her family is going to be like, what were her last words?
5630920	5632920	And I'm like, I'm so sorry, mate.
5632920	5634920	Sky people.
5634920	5636920	You're going to have to forgive me,
5636920	5638920	but is there an enemy there?
5638920	5640920	No, that's a boss.
5640920	5642920	Where's the enemy?
5642920	5644920	That's actually really embarrassing.
5644920	5646920	Yeah, we don't know her last words
5646920	5648920	because I'm a dumb dumb.
5648920	5650920	We're playing that. Hello, are you okay?
5650920	5652920	Are you squiddin' me right now?
5652920	5654920	Brian!
5654920	5656920	True!
5664920	5666920	Okay, Iron Reaper, thank you for the tip.
5666920	5668920	I'll admit, true.
5668920	5670920	However, I present to you
5670920	5672920	Sigourney Weaver
5672920	5674920	Second Storyline.
5674920	5676920	And that's fine with me.
5676920	5678920	I like that she's connected to Pandora
5678920	5680920	and control Pandora, okay?
5680920	5682920	To Awa, and Awa grants her those abilities.
5684920	5686920	I don't think she's doing well.
5686920	5688920	Are you going to expire after we finish
5688920	5690920	talking because
5690920	5692920	I can't translate
5692920	5694920	your last words
5694920	5696920	to tell your
5696920	5698920	to tell your family.
5702920	5704920	Oh!
5704920	5706920	Maybe you should expire
5706920	5708920	because that's actually really sweet.
5710920	5712920	That's really rude. Please don't do that.
5712920	5714920	Please don't do that.
5714920	5716920	Sorry one.
5716920	5718920	Please don't.
5724920	5726920	I need to
5726920	5728920	claim
5728920	5730920	Please bearish.
5730920	5732920	Oh, my bow and arrow is not
5732920	5734920	strong anymore whatsoever.
5734920	5736920	I used to one-shot these guys.
5736920	5738920	It's now costing
5738920	5740920	to ammo.
5742920	5744920	Right.
5744920	5746920	So what we have to do
5746920	5748920	is just climb up these and then jump aboard
5748920	5750920	when it comes background
5750920	5752920	and then we destroy its receiving
5752920	5754920	signal thing, which completely
5756920	5758920	Okay, yeah.
5758920	5760920	Do you remember when we played Elden Ring
5760920	5762920	and there was that chariot thing
5762920	5764920	and you had to drop down on top of it?
5764920	5766920	Basically that.
5766920	5768920	We just need to
5768920	5770920	slowly wait for it to turn.
5770920	5772920	Yep. Okay.
5772920	5774920	And then
5774920	5776920	when we get close enough
5776920	5778920	we just jump down.
5780920	5782920	Wait, can I not just
5782920	5784920	can I not shoot that with bow and arrow?
5786920	5788920	I feel like
5788920	5790920	with their height difference I could probably
5790920	5792920	bow and arrow that. Hmm.
5796920	5798920	Nope.
5798920	5800920	I believe Elden Ring stole that idea.
5800920	5802920	Literally.
5804920	5806920	Right.
5806920	5808920	I think that's just showing
5808920	5810920	I need to go up on this one.
5810920	5812920	I can see it on the minimap that I'm covering up
5812920	5814920	with my big hair but the minimap
5814920	5816920	I wish I could put the minimap in the other corner.
5816920	5818920	You know what?
5818920	5820920	I'm always covering up the minimap when I play games.
5820920	5822920	Hopefully it doesn't bother you guys.
5822920	5824920	I assume it's coming around this corner
5824920	5826920	very slowly.
5826920	5828920	Let's try to shoot out.
5830920	5832920	Are you coming?
5832920	5834920	Hello?
5834920	5836920	Is it stuck?
5836920	5838920	Am I out of its distance to move?
5838920	5840920	Right, you. I can hear you shooting.
5840920	5842920	Knock it off.
5842920	5844920	Stop moving.
5844920	5846920	Oh look the picture plant.
5846920	5848920	Look it's sending flies out to hurt him.
5848920	5850920	Death by flies.
5850920	5852920	Death by flies. Oh he's in.
5852920	5854920	Did he come? I didn't know they could use.
5854920	5856920	Come back. You need to perish by flies
5856920	5858920	or by bow and arrow. Pick.
5860920	5862920	Fine. Okay, I'm out of the distance.
5862920	5864920	Right, is this not?
5866920	5868920	Is it stuck?
5868920	5870920	Why am I going to be stuck?
5870920	5872920	Ugh, fine.
5872920	5874920	I think we're maybe too early.
5874920	5876920	Watch it start moving
5876920	5878920	when I come around this corner.
5878920	5880920	Yeah, I was kind of
5880920	5882920	joking. I was actually
5882920	5884920	joking. But it seriously
5884920	5886920	did it. I knew that. Where's the
5886920	5888920	freaking vein? Where's the vein?
5888920	5890920	Please
5890920	5892920	from the vine
5894920	5896920	falling so slowly
5896920	5898920	like tight.
5898920	5900920	Are you not moving again
5900920	5902920	because I'm out of your render distance?
5904920	5906920	I am being pranked.
5906920	5908920	I am being pranked.
5908920	5910920	Wait, did it move?
5912920	5914920	Wait, that is it there.
5914920	5916920	That's it right there.
5916920	5918920	The render distance is broke.
5920920	5922920	Bro, it's going to start moving.
5922920	5924920	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5924920	5926920	Let me get up the dang thing.
5930920	5932920	Oh, that's literally the only song
5932920	5934920	I know of by heart.
5934920	5936920	It's actually really sad.
5936920	5938920	There is
5938920	5940920	an enemy called Avatar the Last
5940920	5942920	Airbender
5942920	5944920	and Uncle Iroh is an absolute
5944920	5946920	beloved character
5946920	5948920	and he sang a really moving
5948920	5950920	song. It's literally the only
5950920	5952920	song I know off the top of my head.
5952920	5954920	But it's like beautiful
5954920	5956920	sad, not like
5956920	5958920	hopefully not too sad, sad, you know?
5960920	5962920	I need to not bring that song up
5962920	5964920	anywhere close to what I'm making here.
5964920	5966920	We can not allow it for spoilers.
5966920	5968920	Has enemy not seen it?
5968920	5970920	Please stop it. I'm going to cry.
5970920	5972920	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
5972920	5974920	I didn't realize it was bad guys here.
5974920	5976920	Take this
5976920	5978920	and this. Why am I taking
5978920	5980920	so much damage?
5980920	5982920	I don't know.
5982920	5984920	Have I unlocked a new outfit?
5984920	5986920	No, I haven't.
5986920	5988920	Wait, do you see that stat increase though?
5988920	5990920	So as we unlock new outfits, it's going to go up so much.
5990920	5992920	You mean you don't...
5992920	5994920	I don't know Secret Tunnel off my heart.
5994920	5996920	Secret Tunnel, what am I supposed to do?
5998920	6000920	I'm supposed to do something. Hold on.
6000920	6002920	I see the blossoms.
6004920	6006920	Two lovers
6006920	6008920	forbidden from one another.
6010920	6012920	There's a mountain
6012920	6014920	in the way.
6022920	6024920	And I kind of forget
6024920	6026920	how this next part goes.
6026920	6028920	Secret Tunnel
6028920	6030920	Brian, I'm singing.
6034920	6036920	Amy's planning on doing it.
6036920	6038920	So she should definitely support Emure's
6038920	6040920	when she does that. Definitely.
6040920	6042920	Thank you for the tip, Nero.
6048920	6050920	I kind of forgot how this next part goes.
6050920	6052920	Can you guys put the lyrics
6052920	6054920	in chat and then I'll sing it to you?
6056920	6058920	Shawnee, why have all the Scottish people
6058920	6060920	met? Also nice.
6060920	6062920	Why are Scottish people nice?
6062920	6064920	I don't know.
6064920	6066920	We're just vibing.
6066920	6068920	Glasgow's been rated one of the nicest.
6068920	6070920	Oh, we've got to level up.
6070920	6072920	We've got to level up in our healing and our sprint.
6072920	6074920	So are we eating faster?
6074920	6076920	Oh, wow.
6076920	6078920	Okay, that was a pretty decent distance.
6078920	6080920	Are you actually a blue guy in this game?
6080920	6082920	Or are you a skin walker like the movie?
6082920	6084920	We have...
6084920	6086920	Our human body has died.
6086920	6088920	It got annihilated
6088920	6090920	via missiles.
6090920	6092920	So yeah, we're like...
6092920	6094920	We're Navi now. We're just trying to get
6094920	6096920	accepted by the Navi and to reverse
6096920	6098920	the horrific effects
6098920	6100920	that I'm actually
6100920	6102920	not
6102920	6104920	very skilled at this bit.
6104920	6106920	Oh, jeez, Louise!
6108920	6110920	Oh my God, they like ate my health up
6110920	6112920	so quickly. So this is what I mean
6112920	6114920	by you get a second chance.
6114920	6116920	I now have four second chances.
6116920	6118920	Oh my goodness.
6118920	6120920	Get... Right.
6120920	6122920	He's perished.
6122920	6124920	Oh my gosh, that was...
6124920	6126920	Right, he's off of it.
6128920	6130920	I don't know if I need to like
6130920	6132920	unironically XP grind
6132920	6134920	or something.
6134920	6136920	I feel like I die.
6136920	6138920	I think I'm...
6138920	6140920	Okay, we're...
6140920	6142920	We're out of...
6142920	6144920	We're out of... Oh my gosh.
6144920	6146920	I don't remember...
6146920	6148920	I don't remember the game being so hard.
6148920	6150920	You know that?
6150920	6152920	I'm just getting out of here like,
6152920	6154920	bro, I'm out. You don't need to
6154920	6156920	worry about me. I'm gone. I'm in and out
6156920	6158920	like a flash.
6158920	6160920	Call me Usain Bolt. I'm gone.
6160920	6162920	Ten seconds for that.
6162920	6164920	I'm like, you know...
6164920	6166920	No, not leaves from the vine. The other one.
6166920	6168920	The happier one. The two lovers one.
6168920	6170920	Not leaves from the vine. There we go.
6170920	6172920	That's a sad one.
6172920	6174920	Scots are nice until you...
6174920	6176920	Oh, Tia's off, honestly.
6180920	6182920	Oh my bad. Yeah, yeah.
6182920	6184920	I'm trying not to be too...
6184920	6186920	We don't want to be sad up in here.
6186920	6188920	Good times. Good vibes.
6196920	6198920	I have no idea what it is.
6198920	6200920	Strawny, you just channeled some
6200920	6202920	intense Dark Souls energy by spam-rolling away
6202920	6204920	from the attackers, honestly, though.
6204920	6206920	I should probably pick up cell samples
6206920	6208920	because I ended up using two revives
6208920	6210920	for that.
6210920	6212920	I definitely need an armor upgrade
6212920	6214920	to Sumtium because...
6214920	6216920	Oof.
6216920	6218920	Okay, ready?
6226920	6228920	And a burn
6228920	6230920	and devades them
6230920	6232920	apart.
6232920	6234920	The build
6234920	6236920	of paths to be
6236920	6238920	together.
6238920	6240920	And I kind of forgot how the rest
6240920	6242920	of it goes, but
6242920	6244920	Secret Tunnel!
6244920	6246920	Secret Tunnel!
6248920	6250920	It's such a good song.
6252920	6254920	There we go.
6254920	6256920	It's such a good song for you.
6256920	6258920	A little karaoke
6258920	6260920	before the actual karaoke stream is planned.
6260920	6262920	Have a look at that.
6264920	6266920	I've got to stop.
6266920	6268920	That'll get stuck
6268920	6270920	in my head for months.
6270920	6272920	Oh, do you want the Scottish version of it?
6272920	6274920	So it's extra cursed?
6274920	6276920	Wait, someone refit the lyrics in again
6276920	6278920	and I'll do the Scottish version for you
6278920	6280920	because I'm just so kind like that.
6280920	6282920	Wah! Okay.
6282920	6284920	So the close combat is the insta...
6284920	6286920	I said the insta die.
6286920	6288920	Thank you.
6288920	6290920	Right, Scottish version.
6292920	6294920	If someone puts the lyrics in chat for me
6294920	6296920	just so I can...
6296920	6298920	My brain's a little slow.
6298920	6300920	Two lovers
6300920	6302920	forbidden from one another
6302920	6304920	award
6304920	6306920	devades their people
6306920	6308920	for people
6310920	6312920	Brian!
6312920	6314920	You interrupted my singing, Brian.
6314920	6316920	I'm getting absolutely...
6316920	6318920	Alright. Oh, sugar.
6318920	6320920	Thank you for the tip, Rick.
6320920	6322920	Okay, I'm getting too distracted.
6328920	6330920	Thank you for tipping that.
6330920	6332920	You didn't have to tip that.
6332920	6334920	But thank you, I do appreciate it anyway.
6334920	6336920	Scottish version.
6336920	6338920	Wait, should I do really easily, Scots?
6338920	6340920	Two lovers
6340920	6342920	forbidden from one another
6342920	6344920	award
6344920	6346920	devades their people
6348920	6350920	and a mountain
6350920	6352920	devades them apart
6354920	6356920	and built a path
6356920	6358920	a be
6358920	6360920	together
6360920	6362920	Yeah, and I forget who the next couple of lines go.
6362920	6364920	But then it goes
6364920	6366920	secret tunnel
6366920	6368920	secret tunnel
6370920	6372920	through the mountain
6374920	6376920	secret secret secret secret tunnel
6378920	6380920	I think I need to go and visit for this next section.
6382920	6384920	Anyway, that's the Scots rendition.
6384920	6386920	You're welcome for that on the house.
6386920	6388920	Didn't even have to pick. Why?
6388920	6390920	Bone arrow, why?
6390920	6392920	I'll go invisible
6392920	6394920	if I'm going to end up perishing
6394920	6396920	I think.
6396920	6398920	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
6398920	6400920	Okay, these turrets on the wall
6400920	6402920	are my biggest enemies.
6402920	6404920	Got a lot of enemies and it's the turrets on the wall.
6404920	6406920	Not the actual things.
6406920	6408920	Strona, just had any idea for your outfit.
6408920	6410920	What about a version
6410920	6412920	with all of your modesty
6412920	6414920	plasters are replaced by nicotine patches?
6414920	6416920	Honestly?
6416920	6418920	What is going on?
6418920	6420920	I don't
6420920	6422920	Sorry, I really don't remember this section
6422920	6424920	so I don't know what I'm up against
6424920	6426920	but I'm just going to take it slow
6426920	6428920	and I'm not wrong with taking it a bit slow
6428920	6430920	I'm just a bit
6430920	6432920	I can see something over there
6432920	6434920	Oh, he's destroying the car.
6434920	6436920	See empty mechas
6436920	6438920	What's that up there?
6440920	6442920	Can I destroy these for XP?
6442920	6444920	Hold on.
6448920	6450920	Oh, wow.
6450920	6452920	Oh, I'm doing a task sector
6452920	6454920	destroying empty mech.
6454920	6456920	Oh, wow, they explode as well.
6456920	6458920	That's actually really good to know that they explode.
6458920	6460920	Okay, there we go. I press X to do that.
6460920	6462920	Ultimate.
6462920	6464920	Strona, just smoke.
6464920	6466920	No, I just talked too long and my voice is fried.
6466920	6468920	Do you need help with this?
6468920	6470920	You want to gang violence this car?
6470920	6472920	You're taking your sweet time.
6472920	6474920	That's going to blow up, bro.
6474920	6476920	That's going to blow up.
6476920	6478920	Oh, it didn't hurt him though.
6478920	6480920	Oh, I get a lot of XP for doing that.
6480920	6482920	I don't know if we need to farm yet.
6482920	6484920	If we get too weak, we'll farm.
6484920	6486920	But at the moment, we are above the
6486920	6488920	thingy.
6488920	6490920	Watch out. I know.
6490920	6492920	Watch out. She's destroying something.
6496920	6498920	This looks very battle dome-esque
6498920	6500920	but I don't recall.
6500920	6502920	I just heard an Ikram.
6502920	6504920	I think that was an Ikram.
6504920	6506920	Is this the person we need to find?
6506920	6508920	Because I don't think he's looking too good.
6508920	6510920	Are you okay?
6510920	6512920	Oh, he needs some milk.
6516920	6518920	Right, I'm sorry. It was too obvious.
6518920	6520920	That's how you get wrecked.
6522920	6524920	Don't want to get hit that much,
6524920	6526920	but this is literally the best I can do.
6526920	6528920	Okay, that special attack knocks him over.
6528920	6530920	That's really good to know.
6534920	6536920	Okay, that bought me time.
6540920	6542920	That didn't damage me.
6542920	6544920	That explosion didn't damage me.
6544920	6546920	Okay, let's go.
6546920	6548920	Okay, that wasn't that bad.
6548920	6550920	I thought that was going to be like
6550920	6552920	insane battle dome-esque type stuff,
6552920	6554920	but we're safe.
6554920	6556920	Stronny's Inc's Milky.
6556920	6558920	Hold on a minute.
6558920	6560920	Someone described my homemade
6560920	6562920	yogurt as glippy.
6562920	6564920	I have not forgiven you for such descriptions.
6564920	6566920	Is there an enemy over here?
6568920	6570920	Whoa!
6574920	6576920	The frickin...
6578920	6580920	Wait, how much do I have to redo?
6580920	6582920	Because I was deep in that. Okay, I don't have to redo much.
6582920	6584920	The plane took me away with it.
6586920	6588920	Bumped away, man.
6588920	6590920	Bumped away.
6590920	6592920	As far as I'm aware, this game has infinite lives.
6594920	6596920	I probably would never have finished it if I didn't,
6596920	6598920	because, you know...
6600920	6602920	Glippy!
6602920	6604920	Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
6604920	6606920	That is so cheating.
6606920	6608920	They had pre-spondent.
6608920	6610920	Go away.
6610920	6612920	Go through that, because I can't shoot you.
6612920	6614920	I'm going to have to be in viz to claim up this.
6614920	6616920	Oh, my gosh.
6616920	6618920	Where did... where did they go?
6618920	6620920	Right, I need to...
6622920	6624920	Oh, lovely.
6624920	6626920	Okay, there we go.
6626920	6628920	Yeah, I'm not one-shotting nothing.
6628920	6630920	Yeah, I'm going to go up.
6630920	6632920	Just so the screen isn't too red.
6634920	6636920	There, jeez, Louise.
6636920	6638920	Oh, I almost didn't make that.
6638920	6640920	Can I destroy this? Oh, I can.
6640920	6642920	Take that.
6642920	6644920	I didn't get any XP for that, so...
6646920	6648920	That's quite something, honestly.
6648920	6650920	Oh, my Icaran's here!
6650920	6652920	I thought my Icaran was going to come and get me.
6652920	6654920	Okay, it's because it's exploding.
6654920	6656920	My Icaran is coming to get me.
6656920	6658920	Um...
6658920	6660920	Right, okay, let's...
6660920	6662920	See what we're working...
6662920	6664920	We're still not...
6664920	6666920	Whoa, I don't like that.
6666920	6668920	Oh!
6668920	6670920	I messed up!
6670920	6672920	I'm sorry, I even brought attention to my existence.
6672920	6674920	Please, please, please!
6674920	6676920	I'm just a Navi!
6676920	6678920	I'm just a... I'm just a sweet innocent Navi.
6678920	6680920	I'm just a Navi.
6680920	6682920	I'm just a Navi.
6682920	6684920	I'm just a Navi.
6684920	6686920	I'm just a sweet innocent Navi.
6686920	6688920	I'm sorry I tried to pick on you, Mr. Car.
6688920	6690920	I'm sorry.
6690920	6692920	My goodness, that Warthog is powerful.
6692920	6694920	Oh, my goodness!
6696920	6698920	It was just a little arrow.
6698920	6700920	My gosh!
6700920	6702920	And let me up!
6702920	6704920	Literally, light them up!
6704920	6706920	I want that thing out blasted out of the sky!
6708920	6710920	Oh, my goodness.
6710920	6712920	That was not good.
6712920	6714920	You're standing up now, so you feel a bit better.
6714920	6716920	Good.
6716920	6718920	Oh, a great warrior.
6718920	6720920	Oh, you were hating on me about 20 minutes ago.
6722920	6724920	Don't think I... I didn't forget.
6724920	6726920	You're a little hater.
6726920	6728920	Okay, goodbye!
6728920	6730920	Oh, I'm called Dreamwalker now.
6730920	6732920	I'm no longer a sky people.
6732920	6734920	I'm a dreamer.
6734920	6736920	Let me shoot an arrow at this armed vehicle.
6736920	6738920	Look, I have some good ideas
6738920	6740920	and I have some bad ideas.
6740920	6742920	That was a bad idea.
6746920	6748920	Oh, there's...
6748920	6750920	What the heck is this?
6750920	6752920	What did I do with that?
6752920	6754920	Oh, we got an unlock.
6754920	6756920	What did we get?
6756920	6758920	A lookup hack.
6758920	6760920	Invis for longer.
6760920	6762920	Oh, we've got a bow and arrow upgrade
6762920	6764920	and a weapon upgrade.
6764920	6766920	Oh, look, her bow's changed.
6766920	6768920	Look, it's a different design now.
6768920	6770920	What am I supposed to do with these crystals?
6770920	6772920	Excuse me.
6774920	6776920	Am I supposed...
6776920	6778920	Here we go.
6778920	6780920	I guess I'm to follow the crystals
6780920	6782920	because it's doing the little lights.
6782920	6784920	Okay, it's to follow it.
6784920	6786920	Oh, good job!
6786920	6788920	I'm freaking...
6788920	6790920	Okay, we're safe.
6790920	6792920	My goodness.
6792920	6794920	I don't know what I need in order to survive
6794920	6796920	other than an armor upgrade,
6796920	6798920	but warthogs are so unforgiving.
6798920	6800920	I was a mecha as I've unlocked now.
6800920	6802920	See, we're starting to get out of the tutorial
6802920	6804920	where the game does not forgive.
6804920	6806920	Like, the game will annihilate you
6806920	6808920	if you don't, like, level up and stuff.
6808920	6810920	Oh, my horse is getting really shot out there.
6810920	6812920	I didn't like that.
6812920	6814920	I didn't enjoy that.
6814920	6816920	More enemies?
6816920	6818920	It's impassable.
6820920	6822920	Oh, for...
6822920	6824920	No, Mr. Horsey!
6824920	6826920	Please do not...
6826920	6828920	Wait!
6828920	6830920	Gang violence!
6830920	6832920	Oh, my horse just perished
6832920	6834920	but I saw him attack on the leaf.
6834920	6836920	That's two games where the horse actually helps you.
6838920	6840920	Okay, we're just going to have to take the risk
6840920	6842920	on foot, sadly.
6844920	6846920	Did they attack me if I'm Navi?
6846920	6848920	I feel like...
6848920	6850920	Oh, it's so beautiful!
6850920	6852920	Oh!
6854920	6856920	Yeah, I really don't want them to attack me.
6858920	6860920	I'm definitely picking up the...
6866920	6868920	Uh-huh.
6876920	6878920	I was hoping they didn't attack.
6878920	6880920	Oh, I've gone the wrong way.
6880920	6882920	I'm getting too distracted.
6882920	6884920	Oh, I don't want to hurt the whale blade.
6884920	6886920	It just sucks.
6886920	6888920	Wait a minute! What did she call me?
6888920	6890920	Raider!
6890920	6892920	I hardly even know her!
6896920	6898920	Oh, you didn't like that one?
6898920	6900920	I guess... Yeah, I guess I repeated it.
6900920	6902920	I'm sorry.
6904920	6906920	Yeah, okay, I won't recycle jokes.
6906920	6908920	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
6912920	6914920	I can't see.
6916920	6918920	Okay, I'm sorry, but you guys are going to have to go.
6920920	6922920	I really wish they wouldn't attack.
6922920	6924920	Oh, hello! Are you the person I need?
6924920	6926920	Man who is not man.
6926920	6928920	And Navi who is not Navi.
6928920	6930920	You are a puzzle.
6930920	6932920	Piece of Ewa's puzzle.
6932920	6934920	Oh!
6934920	6936920	Okay, I'm dreamwalking.
6936920	6938920	Have we got an upgrade?
6938920	6940920	Uh, hi.
6940920	6942920	Yes, hi.
6942920	6944920	Why is it you walk my dream?
6944920	6946920	I thought no scrawny stream today?
6946920	6948920	Are you sure about that?
6948920	6950920	Shibi Reminder!
6950920	6952920	Okay, for those of you who are listening in
6952920	6954920	and are part of the Hair M,
6954920	6956920	Shibi Cottonbomb
6956920	6958920	is going live
6958920	6960920	in T-minus.
6960920	6962920	Four minutes.
6962920	6964920	She may actually be on the loading screen.
6966920	6968920	Eh, but yes.
6968920	6970920	If there's any new YouTube mods lurking,
6970920	6972920	you are welcome to speak!
6972920	6974920	But then I remove your speaking privileges
6974920	6976920	instantly.
6976920	6978920	Class of 09.
6978920	6980920	What is Class of 09?
6980920	6982920	Have you guys played that?
6982920	6984920	Scrawny Streams never end.
6984920	6986920	The Return of Herald Endurance Cuttlefish.
6988920	6990920	As I play the Navi part,
6990920	6992920	I did it later as a human.
6992920	6994920	Wrong.
6994920	6996920	I've literally never done the RDA save.
6996920	6998920	Right, we will take...
6998920	7000920	Oh, look how beautiful this is.
7000920	7002920	Literally glowing in the dark
7002920	7004920	is just stunning.
7004920	7006920	Oh, could you imagine it
7006920	7008920	with graphics that are updated?
7008920	7010920	Like, ugh.
7010920	7012920	I have no idea what's in the new avatar game.
7012920	7014920	Maybe we should play it for the first time together,
7014920	7016920	but I think it is as beautiful as this.
7016920	7018920	Right, why am I here?
7018920	7020920	Oh, to get these crystals.
7020920	7022920	Okay.
7022920	7024920	We're just gonna ignore.
7026920	7028920	Um...
7028920	7030920	Because if we can just run
7030920	7032920	in and out of these sections,
7032920	7034920	if you hang around and kill anything,
7034920	7036920	yes, you will get faster XP!
7036920	7038920	Faster XP!
7038920	7040920	Oh, I don't want my horse to die.
7040920	7042920	I'm so sorry, Mr. Horsey.
7042920	7044920	Please don't die.
7044920	7046920	Oh, no. Oh, no.
7046920	7048920	Come on. We need to get out of here.
7048920	7050920	Like, right now, I don't want you to pass away.
7050920	7052920	I want you to have a happy life
7052920	7054920	and retire at your old age.
7054920	7056920	Okay.
7056920	7058920	And, wait, this horse here
7058920	7060920	is getting attacked as well?
7060920	7062920	Oh, it's beating up that mech.
7062920	7064920	I was gonna actually take it so this one can live
7064920	7066920	and out, but...
7066920	7068920	Oh, I don't know if we're gonna make it
7068920	7070920	if they've got flippin' flamethrowers
7070920	7072920	and I've got the wrong way because again,
7072920	7074920	it all turned around.
7074920	7076920	Oh, please, live, little horsey.
7076920	7078920	Oh, no! The horsey's not gonna...
7078920	7080920	Right, that's it. We're clearing this out.
7080920	7082920	We're clearing this out. Leave my horse alone.
7082920	7084920	Everything is so strong!
7086920	7088920	Who, who, who?
7088920	7090920	You, perish.
7090920	7092920	Gosh.
7092920	7094920	I don't have anyone to take out my special one.
7094920	7096920	Right, I'm healing because we're going...
7096920	7098920	Oh!
7098920	7100920	Wait, I actually came out in your avatar.
7100920	7102920	Yeah, there's a new one.
7102920	7104920	Didn't check it out yet.
7104920	7106920	I'm gonna take more samples because I've actually only got three.
7106920	7108920	Wait, how far away?
7108920	7110920	It's a wee bit away.
7110920	7112920	It's a wee bit away.
7112920	7114920	Alright, we are gonna pick up cell samples.
7114920	7116920	Just...
7116920	7118920	No! My horse was still going to retirement!
7118920	7120920	You're so mean!
7120920	7122920	Ow!
7122920	7124920	Did that plant just smack me back?
7124920	7126920	Bang!
7126920	7128920	The horse has already passed away.
7128920	7130920	Man, he had a pension fund
7130920	7132920	and everything.
7132920	7134920	Imagine working your whole life.
7134920	7136920	Actually, I read a story about like that.
7136920	7138920	Where someone worked their whole life
7138920	7140920	and they got one week of retirement and passed away.
7140920	7142920	And it was like, I would be so mad.
7142920	7144920	I would be so mad.
7144920	7146920	I would explain to Death himself
7146920	7148920	like, look mate,
7148920	7150920	I've kind of sweat my whole life.
7150920	7152920	Direct Brian!
7168920	7170920	I...
7170920	7172920	I remember the game couldn't be played by streamers
7172920	7174920	on the basis of...
7174920	7176920	Like, it's super easy to get like your IP going.
7176920	7178920	Like, it's super easy to get like your IP going.
7178920	7180920	Um...
7180920	7182920	But if they fixed it, honestly,
7182920	7184920	black ops with the boys.
7184920	7186920	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7188920	7190920	Have a little drink, have a sipping tin.
7190920	7192920	Thank you very much for the tip.
7192920	7194920	Tarja, I appreciate that.
7194920	7196920	Yeah.
7196920	7198920	Shawnee, the horses only live for three days anyway.
7198920	7200920	What? And Pandora?
7200920	7202920	I'm gonna hang with Sheep now.
7202920	7204920	She's live with classable name
7204920	7206920	which I actually don't know what the good is about.
7206920	7208920	But...
7208920	7210920	I imagine. Had rails, it was that basically how to...
7210920	7212920	Oh, I'm sorry.
7212920	7214920	But yeah.
7216920	7218920	We must draw Harmonic from tree.
7218920	7220920	Shawnee, think with tree.
7220920	7222920	Help find Harmonic.
7222920	7224920	Oh no.
7224920	7226920	Harmonics, help find sleeping well of swords.
7226920	7228920	I think I know where this is gonna go.
7232920	7234920	Oh!
7236920	7238920	Okay, that line delivery
7238920	7240920	was a bit...
7240920	7242920	No!
7242920	7244920	Lungori.
7244920	7246920	No, refling.
7246920	7248920	Don't die.
7250920	7252920	I will say one thing.
7252920	7254920	For the VAs of this game,
7254920	7256920	especially for older games in the past,
7256920	7258920	odds are they had no idea
7258920	7260920	what the scene actually had
7260920	7262920	and they were just given a script
7262920	7264920	and just said
7264920	7266920	they don't know the depth of the script or what occurred.
7266920	7268920	It was only until recent stuff
7268920	7270920	where actors can see live what they're performing.
7270920	7272920	So...
7272920	7274920	Follow the sound of vibrations
7274920	7276920	and find tuning points.
7278920	7280920	Huh?
7280920	7282920	Oh!
7284920	7286920	Okay, if there's three,
7286920	7288920	it's probably gonna be identical.
7288920	7290920	Yeah, okay.
7290920	7292920	Wait, hold on.
7292920	7294920	Yeah, okay, and then the last one's gonna be like right here.
7294920	7296920	Because of the way triangles work.
7296920	7298920	Yeah, I love triangles.
7298920	7300920	What's your...
7300920	7302920	Yeah, you know what, favorite shape?
7302920	7304920	I'ma give it in our rectangle.
7304920	7306920	Triangle or rectangle for favorite shape.
7308920	7310920	Oh, it's singing to me. Hold on.
7310920	7312920	I feel like something mystical is about to happen.
7312920	7314920	I'm actually getting a bit scared.
7318920	7320920	Hydration check.
7322920	7324920	Oh, no.
7326920	7328920	So it was the same as the Sonic Adventure show.
7328920	7330920	It's a wooden delivery, get it?
7330920	7332920	Because of the trees?
7332920	7334920	It was a wooden delivery.
7338920	7340920	Oh, shucks.
7340920	7342920	I came up with that myself.
7342920	7344920	Came up with that comment myself.
7344920	7346920	I'm so wetty as a streamer, aren't I?
7348920	7350920	I'm just gonna start stealing your guys's
7350920	7352920	like witty comments.
7352920	7354920	And then doing that over.
7354920	7356920	Oh, I have a new armor.
7356920	7358920	New armor.
7358920	7360920	Oh my god, girl game, girl game.
7360920	7362920	Oh, yeah, like the protection.
7362920	7364920	What is vitality?
7364920	7366920	What does that mean?
7366920	7368920	More health?
7368920	7370920	They have more health overall because of the armor?
7370920	7372920	Yeah, well, you can see where they added more armor on to me.
7372920	7374920	You have solved content creation.
7374920	7376920	Okay, well, what am I?
7376920	7378920	Looks like...
7378920	7380920	Oh, that's proper harmonized.
7382920	7384920	Yeah, good luck hitting them.
7384920	7386920	Nope, that's long time.
7386920	7388920	Armor barely covers anything.
7388920	7390920	And honestly, like,
7390920	7392920	they are using...
7392920	7394920	Right, we're going to home tree.
7394920	7396920	Wait, we're going back to home tree?
7396920	7398920	Oh, what?
7398920	7400920	I'm about to report to them that, oh, by the way,
7400920	7402920	Longody's dead.
7402920	7404920	I'm going to cry from that joke literally.
7404920	7406920	What, cry of pain?
7406920	7408920	Or just like, just like how ridiculous it was?
7410920	7412920	Okay, we are going to be polite
7412920	7414920	to Ewa and respect the home tree
7414920	7416920	by not doing backflips all the way up
7416920	7418920	the trunk of the tree.
7418920	7420920	Okay.
7420920	7422920	Oh my god, it's tree balls.
7422920	7424920	We love tree balls.
7424920	7426920	This is getting very bright in here.
7426920	7428920	I'm not gonna lie.
7428920	7430920	Do I need to recalibrate? Hold on.
7430920	7432920	Professional streamer, I think I need to recalibrate my muscles.
7436920	7438920	Okay, there we go.
7438920	7440920	Recalibrating.
7446920	7448920	Oh, we did actually report Longody's passing.
7448920	7450920	Okay.
7454920	7456920	Not the thumbs up!
7456920	7458920	Not the thumbs up.
7458920	7460920	So human of you, please don't do that again.
7462920	7464920	Thumbs up.
7464920	7466920	Can I just hum a few bars?
7466920	7468920	A little tap on the shoulder.
7468920	7470920	Sing!
7470920	7472920	What am I saying?
7472920	7474920	Am I actually just like...
7474920	7476920	Is this like a minigame or any like...
7478920	7482920	What on earth is this freaky stuff going on here?
7482920	7484920	Uh...
7486920	7488920	I don't even remember that at all.
7488920	7490920	Thumbs up!
7490920	7492920	Let's just try to come through.
7502920	7504920	Okay.
7504920	7506920	Alright.
7512920	7514920	So this is campaign mode getting explained to us.
7516920	7518920	I totally know the plot inside out from this game.
7520920	7522920	Yeah.
7522920	7524920	Assassin's Creed, I know the plot of this.
7528920	7530920	All I know is that we're doing good for the planet.
7530920	7532920	No, please, even if not directed at me, they hurt anyway.
7538920	7540920	What if the trees wanted to see a sick backflip?
7542920	7544920	I don't know.
7544920	7546920	Mission complete.
7546920	7548920	Mission complete.
7548920	7550920	Oh, I'm not to jump around.
7550920	7552920	Jump up.
7552920	7554920	Can I put my weapons away?
7554920	7556920	I feel like having weapons out in this location isn't very pleasant.
7556920	7558920	No, put the RDA gun on me.
7560920	7562920	Why is this so bright?
7562920	7564920	I don't ever... Oh my god!
7564920	7566920	I don't ever recall that issue.
7566920	7568920	Oh, hello again.
7568920	7570920	I would like to talk to you for my next mission.
7574920	7576920	Doroknaring.
7580920	7582920	Yeah, he's probably a bit mad at me for, you know,
7582920	7584920	spending five years in cryo.
7588920	7590920	Yeah.
7590920	7592920	Never on the enemy side.
7592920	7594920	But we're the goodies, so they're the enemies.
7596920	7598920	We're healing nature.
7598920	7600920	We're healing nature.
7600920	7604920	Mother nature always reclaims all.
7604920	7608920	Mother, mother, mother, mother nature.
7610920	7612920	This looks like a darker map.
7612920	7614920	Beautiful.
7614920	7616920	Toph ASMR will play?
7618920	7620920	I can't really do later voices like Toph.
7620920	7622920	Oh, Katana.
7624920	7626920	Look, there's the castle.
7626920	7628920	That's what I would say if I could see
7628920	7630920	something.
7630920	7632920	If I wasn't blind.
7632920	7634920	I can't really hear a voice at all.
7636920	7638920	Is it a castle?
7638920	7640920	There's something in the sand.
7640920	7642920	Or the library? There's the library.
7642920	7644920	Katana.
7644920	7646920	Oh, sorry. It's not Katana.
7646920	7648920	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
7650920	7652920	It's upside down.
7652920	7654920	Isn't it?
7656920	7658920	Katana? Close enough. I know. I know.
7658920	7660920	Katana wins.
7660920	7662920	Good luck, Tanjala.
7662920	7664920	Good luck, Tanjala.
7664920	7666920	Oh, who's this? Hello. How do you do?
7668920	7670920	Oh, I need a pause.
7670920	7672920	Pause on the shards. Pause champ on the shards.
7676920	7678920	A little cheeky hydration check.
7678920	7680920	A little cheeky hydration check.
7684920	7686920	There's the library.
7686920	7688920	That's what it would sound like
7688920	7690920	if one of us would bother you.
7698920	7700920	Okay, I'm going to say something controversial.
7702920	7704920	You know when maps are straight ahead like this?
7704920	7706920	Yeah?
7706920	7708920	I like that.
7708920	7710920	I appreciate when games don't make you go back and forth
7710920	7714920	and you just keep going forward.
7714920	7716920	When a game makes you turn around
7716920	7718920	to go do something on the map
7718920	7720920	that you were previously at that area...
7724920	7726920	However,
7726920	7730920	when a game makes it nice and linear...
7732920	7734920	I'm not going to lie, I almost fell off there.
7734920	7736920	Oh, and I can't actually see where I'm supposed to go.
7736920	7738920	Thanks to the sleeve.
7738920	7740920	Oh, there we go.
7740920	7742920	Backtrack hate.
7742920	7744920	Yeah, backtracking a bit.
7746920	7748920	Okay.
7748920	7750920	Let's see how it goes.
7750920	7752920	Okay, so if you take the high ground...
7754920	7756920	Wait, look! That's why they attack me.
7756920	7758920	They've got backpacks on the wolves
7758920	7760920	and that's why they attack me.
7760920	7762920	I'm just thinking.
7762920	7764920	The RDA put like main control devices
7764920	7766920	on the wolves
7766920	7768920	and now they want to attack me even though I'm Navi.
7770920	7772920	I'm Navi and I'm navigating.
7772920	7774920	What the heck am I doing here?
7774920	7776920	Am I destroying stuff?
7778920	7780920	Don't have to ask me twice!
7782920	7784920	Challenge complete.
7784920	7786920	I'm going to do it from up here.
7786920	7788920	Oh, I see.
7788920	7790920	So I'm releasing the native
7790920	7792920	Navi
7792920	7794920	and destroying the...
7794920	7796920	Jesus.
7796920	7798920	Why?
7798920	7800920	We're literally so low level
7800920	7802920	we're not even one-shotting.
7804920	7806920	Can I break you?
7806920	7808920	Oh, I can.
7810920	7812920	I like how he just don't.
7812920	7814920	Oh, he like dives over.
7814920	7816920	I mean, honestly, if an arrow struck me
7816920	7818920	I'd probably...
7818920	7820920	Oh, we did it!
7820920	7822920	Like, Ori and the Blame Force.
7824920	7826920	I tru...
7826920	7828920	Wait, wait, wait.
7828920	7830920	What am I supposed to do with that?
7830920	7832920	Destroy it?
7832920	7834920	I'm just going to pump...
7834920	7836920	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me pump all the ammo into it.
7836920	7838920	Where's my gun?
7838920	7840920	I can't...
7840920	7842920	Your hate, you're teasing me.
7842920	7844920	I'm not even hitting you.
7844920	7846920	Bro.
7846920	7848920	You're literally right under the tree.
7848920	7850920	I'm going to have to go...
7852920	7854920	No, stop shooting me.
7854920	7856920	I need to destroy this.
7856920	7858920	Hello?
7858920	7860920	Oh, wait, oh, wait.
7860920	7862920	Oh.
7862920	7864920	No?
7864920	7866920	Game?
7868920	7870920	Game?
7870920	7872920	Game?
7872920	7874920	Do I need...
7874920	7876920	To hit the other side of it, I guess?
7876920	7880920	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
7880920	7882920	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
7882920	7884920	Oh, my God.
7884920	7886920	Jeez, Louise.
7886920	7888920	They are killing us here.
7888920	7890920	That was very strange.
7890920	7892920	But we did it. That's the main thing.
7892920	7894920	Uh, maybe we should not.
7894920	7896920	Are you trying to shoot that guy?
7896920	7898920	And you're missing, like, horribly? Oh, you are.
7898920	7903380	Oh, and I'm missing horribly too. You know that both of us are as bad as each other
7904960	7908060	He healed as I bruh come on
7910680	7912980	Hello, would you like to talk to me? Oh
7914480	7916480	Oh for sure
7919120	7925920	Does he know I'm coming no that check and works if the map is good. Yes, I would argue yeah, I
7926920	7929760	Did try and play Ori in the blind forest
7931320	7938160	But I was just to pay to pay go. It's definitely not a stream game for me, but one of the other girls
7940000	7945200	Likely would play it. I feel like it's a and I definitely chill stream chill stream. Yeah
7946480	7950240	This is actually a really beautiful map because you get to run along the little tree roots
7950240	7953320	Which I really like yay nature nature wins again
7956920	7963960	Right I can see and we're maybe fighting here or are we
7967240	7972160	Are we just running through this oh, wow, we actually did pretty decent damage
7973200	7975200	Yeah, wow, I'll take that
7976000	7978000	I think
7981080	7984040	They keep I can only I'm okay hold on I
7984200	7989760	It doesn't seem like an objective area because of that reason. I'm just gonna do this
7989760	7993920	I know I shouldn't I know I should probably like level up a bit
7993920	7997120	But I am very happy just to keep walking on the tree trunks
7997640	8004760	You want a non chill stream place a list? I've seen a lot of streamers place a list like it's interesting to see what like
8006080	8009960	Oh, I'm in trouble. Oh, I'm in trouble. Oh, I'm in trouble. Oh
8011800	8016920	My god, I did not remember being in so much trouble playing this game
8017320	8022040	What's the way? I think it's maybe I used to farm areas to level up and I was just so OP
8022360	8027320	Because I think this map. We're actually supposed to be unlocking a green
8028280	8030080	Armor right now
8030080	8032080	But I ain't doing it
8032960	8039640	I'm just doing some back foot literally backflip dodge and bullets right we're getting ready to attack these guys
8039640	8046120	But I need to actually activate the quest by talking to this guy before we attack and release more of Pandora's
8046720	8048220	me
8048220	8049720	How can I help?
8049720	8051720	You would not like my answer
8051920	8054760	Listen like it or not. You've got my help on this one
8055280	8056280	string
8056280	8059280	The top two loader sky machines with weapons
8060280	8064840	Was it I think for anyone who did actually watch the first avatar movie
8064840	8067200	I think scound means like idiot or something like that like
8068080	8070700	You have to go like scum or else. You're not saying it, right?
8077200	8081320	Yeah, I feel like I replayed and leveled up a lot more as a child and right now
8081320	8086640	We're just like speedrunning through this although when you do complete a mission you do get like a nice chunk of XP so
8087240	8088440	Oh
8088440	8092160	Speaking of leveling up. I have a six-minute timer at the top of the screen
8094880	8101880	That looks like a protection spell that I am putting on I didn't realize I unlocked some sort of protection thing
8101880	8109480	I definitely want to put whatever that is greatly reduces. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, we'll definitely be utilizing that right woman to do
8110760	8112760	Right, let's test this out. Oh
8113760	8119320	I'm not to destroy the ship jump up here
8122680	8124680	Hello, oh
8125800	8130360	Wait, I can just yeah, is this what I'm supposed to destroy. Oh
8131560	8136640	Yeah, okay is yeah, take that you like that. Yeah, you like a big adult
8136640	8141520	Oh, I'm gonna get a blurt raid cuz it's face a minute. I'm getting I'm getting shaky. I'm getting scared
8143000	8150440	Okay, we're fine. We're fine. Like honestly smooth sailing. Okay, the NPCs aren't really locking on to me too well because of the distance
8150840	8153560	But we're making it. We're making it
8154240	8158080	They're getting a bit closer. So I might have to start shooting them a wee bit
8159600	8163840	Well, that was a good shot there one more and then that's three of four
8164960	8171160	You're telling me that quad aero thing can stay up with three. I don't believe it
8172040	8178080	One more two more. I'm not hitting that. Oh, it's not registering
8179720	8182200	It's gonna spam it down. Am I supposed to
8185160	8189160	Of course the thing I want is like not facing me
8192320	8194320	Okay, they were
8194320	8196320	I
8199200	8201200	Human iron
8201880	8209280	Literally that the steel a crann is no match for me. I'm gonna look this stuff. I've got three revives. Oh
8211280	8213280	My gosh, oh
8214240	8216960	The poor babies they're not even attacking us
8217680	8222720	Out you come baby. Wait, so okay looks like regular ones don't attack me anymore. Hello
8225120	8230680	Yes, they were cruel to him if we can heal his wounds, you will fight
8230680	8236560	I think we're gonna raid him every palulu. Whatever I've ever meant was to eat me alive
8237200	8244480	He is still our brother. We will heal him with a was medicine. Oh, that's so cute. We're helping the little forest prayers
8245040	8247040	Bring them to me
8247720	8251520	What do you need? I'm sorry medication for the guy
8252480	8258520	I'll just basic flowers. That's fine. I can get that. That's that's the problem. Hold on. Hold that thought little guy
8258520	8260520	I'm coming back
8260520	8266800	And then I think we get to ride him into battle like a horse, but it's not a horse
8266800	8271400	I think it's called a fanator if I remember correctly. Oh
8271600	8275600	My goodness. I remember that time I said in this map, you don't have to backtrack
8276600	8282420	Honestly, it's not that bad though because it's to help an animal and you know, we
8282920	8287160	Shadow wizard money gang. We love healing nature from these parts
8289440	8291440	I'm going in
8294320	8298560	Oh, I mean sprayed and prayed but they can't get me I'm too good
8300840	8304400	Gather plants from the banshee's nest. Oh, that's what
8305880	8307880	Suppose we'd be comfortable
8309320	8311320	Pandora is Ohio, but more natural
8314400	8317640	You're not allowed to speak for the next 20 seconds, do you understand me
8319880	8321880	Don't say that again
8327760	8333440	I'm so excited for your ace mushroom. I just want new earbuds for oh, you're making a good. I hope it is not a disappointment
8334320	8335160	I
8335160	8340280	Most likely will not do ear licking. I'm just gonna say that now before anyone gets thingy
8340280	8345160	I have no idea what an earth is going on with YouTube and ear licking at the moment
8345800	8349800	Something there's either a policy update being pushed or something
8350320	8352960	But for some reason anime earlicks bad
8353480	8355480	in real life human person
8355520	8357520	earlicks fine, so I
8358080	8361440	Don't want you be disappointed. I have put a lot of thought and effort into it
8361440	8368040	So hopefully the smart is good. I don't know how long I'm gonna stream for and the problem is I get really distracted when like I
8368040	8371640	Like I constantly read your guys's stuff because you guys make me laugh all the time
8371920	8376480	So I'm not really sure how official and ASMR. It's gonna be so do apologize
8376920	8380640	It's probably I'll probably try hard for like 15 minutes, and then it's just gonna
8381840	8383840	Oh, that's so cool
8384040	8386040	rides a sacred beast
8386200	8388280	Has a will go mad. No
8392000	8394800	Whiskers honestly though we whiskers
8396440	8403240	It's impossible because YouTube can't tell the difference I that's my theory at the moment is that anime is getting
8403880	8407480	Because YouTube are saying it's implied else
8408440	8413040	Whereas we all know like what actual ear licking sounds like because it's literally a 3d microphone
8414000	8418640	So it's really putting a bit of a hindrance on my plans
8422400	8424000	My
8424000	8430800	Yard is this not the coolest ride you've ever seen. Oh my god. It's so cool. Oh, he leaves

8482840	8484840	Okay
8486480	8493720	Why do not speak like you understand why is she so informal when talking to this guy
8494360	8498240	You have to pick your battles be this guy speaking a second language
8498480	8503880	But at least try and speak clear English, you know, so it's easier for him Danny go back before it's okay

8815360	8817360	She knows
8823120	8825120	Oh, that is really rough
8825120	8829360	That was a rough landing with the animation on the uh navi there. I have to admit
8830640	8832640	Bending with the uh
8834080	8839840	Right, let's unlock the home tree. No, not home tree tree of vision, which lets us teleport around the map
8840720	8843280	Yeah, it was crunchy. That was crunchy. That was 2009 showing
8845120	8851840	I never know how long these like bigger games take to develop. I still think it's like three years development two years development
8852960	8859280	This smallest development game time crunch I ever heard was followed new vegas. That was like big like that
8860400	8867680	I think they said it was 11 months development. Um, which was crazy all things considered
8868400	8870400	Uh
8870720	8875760	I think we just walk the rest of the writer come in kendrick. Tell me some good news

8962960	8964960	Oh actual cutscene
8965600	8967840	Yeah, we do not get actual cutscenes like this often
8969280	8971280	Oh
8974640	8980400	Sorry, I'm petting my hair right now that the my my hair is up in a bun
8983440	8985440	I've done it all that sounded rather odd
8988320	8990320	Two and a half
8990720	8996560	You get one more of those jokes for all your jokes will come on funny. I don't have any more sound effects to do it with
8997440	8999440	I don't have any more sound effects
9000080	9003760	That's them all so I can't make the joke again. I've only got crickets now
9006800	9008800	Oh
9009760	9014080	I really don't like hurting these guys, but if they're baddies, there's nothing I can really be

9043120	9047120	I'm stuck in the corner. I cast protection
9049520	9055200	Okay, thank god this game is so buggy. Oh, I didn't mean to do that. I didn't mean to heal I wasted that heal
9057440	9062720	Oh, this is making me nervous. Haha. You can't come on the rock. You can't come on the rock
9064400	9068800	Most games for older games elevation really bugs out the ai's that they have
9069120	9074560	So don't be afraid to use elevation to your advantage because then you get moments like this
9074960	9080320	Where you can just have a good time because they can't get on the elevation. Okay
9081200	9085840	For you, glad that's over because that is really not an easy enemy to defeat in the rail
9086720	9089920	My gasman buck rug. Shona, you seem to have upgraded
9090720	9092720	Upgrades available top left. Wait actually
9095040	9101200	No, I don't I don't unless it's that greatly improved damage for a short amount of time
9103600	9109920	Can I yeah like for some reason if you don't like tab over these it will constantly tell you you have like weapon upgrades and stuff
9111280	9113280	What else have I got?
9114640	9119760	Yeah, so like things get more like stronger as we progress
9121120	9124640	I could do a club honestly. Let's see the club. What does it look like?
9126560	9128560	Oh, that's a meaty swing
9131040	9134080	Oh, that's a load up though to get that that's quite a load up
9135040	9141520	Oh, yeah that uh, it doesn't okay. No, this is for these guys. It's the double
9142080	9144080	It's the double for me that you're wield
9145280	9150960	Oh, why would you guys even be in a broken facility? Be honest right now
9154800	9157840	Oh, why how are you even getting me through a fence?
9157920	9159920	Oh
9160160	9164640	Well, I need to aim you need to reload so which one of us is going to go down first
9165760	9167760	The yeah the club's too slow
9168960	9170960	All right, I'm just gonna go for it
9172000	9177040	Okay. Yeah one shot with the things I'll take that. Is there anyone else here? I hear him
9177840	9180160	I hear him. I can't see him. Oh, he's so tiny
9181200	9183200	Oh, you're so tiny. I can't even see it
9184000	9186000	Ha ha ha you're welcome
9188800	9191520	Gank up on gank up on that's what I get for making a joke
9194560	9196560	Spank spank spank
9198800	9201600	Hello, scrawny there was no notification for your shuman discord
9203520	9209440	Discord hates me. I can't believe it. I'm not just I'm not discord's little kitten or whatever. I said anything that thing
9210400	9217280	Uh, she be is live right now with class of 09 if that game is more of an interest to you because I'm literally playing the most like
9217760	9219520	Unknown game ever
9219520	9221840	I don't know if this game out on
9222480	9223920	PlayStation
9223920	9228560	In that as well. I don't remember it being. Oh, there's a Thanator in here
9229520	9231520	Where is it?
9232080	9235840	Oh, I hear it. Where is it? Oh, it's literally right there
9236800	9239040	Uh, we'll just spray it down
9243760	9245760	Oh, I'm already out of ammo
9247200	9249200	I thought I was gonna be like
9249920	9254720	Oh, okay. Now he's not coded to go any further. I was gonna say I'm like
9255280	9260640	I didn't I think it was coded to go any further. This is another thing about older games
9260960	9264960	You can like just absolutely smurf them because
9265440	9269920	There's only so much game memory and game storage that they can allocate for areas
9270160	9276080	Which means coding wise they will just stop enemies from doing stuff like that. I just I just love it
9276080	9281040	I appreciate it so much like it just makes everything nice and easy peasy lemon squeezy
9282960	9285840	What you got to complain about? Huh? What you got to complain about?
9286560	9291520	I know the game did come out on PlayStation 3. Okay. Okay. So it wasn't I didn't think it was an xbox exclusive
9292080	9295040	I but I don't think ever got released on steam. Whoa
9297040	9299040	Hi
9301040	9303040	Hydration check, I mean

9311360	9313360	You think I enjoy this
9314400	9319920	How much do I need to play for that RDA? I've never done it. I've genuinely never done it. I don't think
9320880	9323840	So you don't need to pay anything at all. I've got to an RDA
9329040	9334240	I assume the RDA is just like congrats. You've destroyed the planet. Thanks. And then the game then the credits just roll
9334720	9336720	That's how I imagine the RDA side ends
9337680	9345360	The are you afraid of are you afraid of yourself for beating a helpless NPC? Hold on. I'm getting rolled
9347440	9352960	Oh my armor. I've just noticed that my armor. Oh my god girl moment. I'm a good fashion show fashion
9353280	9356800	I've got a passion. Whoa. Look at that protection. What are you squidding me right now?

9389600	9392160	So hopefully we can take a wall open now
9393040	9395440	Because uh, are we faster as well?
9397600	9399600	Oh

9456640	9461120	If they start having like knockback, that's when it gets dangerous like being in the middle of the enemies
9461520	9465280	So do forgive me if I literally just blow past all these sections
9466960	9468240	Oh
9468240	9470240	I can do that. That's fine

9640960	9642960	Mercy's just de-embed me
9643040	9647120	Strongly my alt twitter's growing really fast. You are right. I'm scared
9649120	9651600	But under the tweet I'm getting nervous should I post this?

9668720	9670720	Yeah, I have replied to mercy
9673920	9678080	For a yandere she sure does uh love being like unironical
9678080	9683040	This is going to sound really weird when I say this out loud. She sure does love being a good girl and getting permission for everything
9683680	9685680	for a yandere
9686400	9689200	Like literally all of the girls are so fantastic
9689920	9695760	Yeah, we're we're slowly getting past the stage of do I need do I need permission to do this?
9695760	9700240	Do I need um because the answer is always no you do not need my permission. You are in control
9700880	9702880	So I was the same
9703600	9705600	The best kind of yandere
9706720	9708720	You know
9709440	9710640	Jesus

9714320	9715520	Um
9715520	9719520	But yes, the girls are definitely easing into the concept that because
9720400	9723200	I assume, you know, they've consumed enough kind of like
9723360	9728960	Oh most future brave agencies like have this long list of rules that you have to abide by and it's like my rules are like literally
9730000	9733520	You know be be cool with lollipop stuff and um
9734960	9736960	Uh, no no male collabs
9737680	9739680	And you know that's a
9739680	9743760	It gets really simple. You do everything yourself. I'm not going to tell you what to do. I'm not going to dictate your content
9743760	9745040	So brian
9745040	9752240	Yes, you can post whatever you want my dear mercy leaks classified military documents war thunder style
9752880	9755440	I know about that if you didn't know
9756240	9760720	military documents keep getting leaked in a video game because people are like
9761200	9766320	They're like so like wanting everything to be correct, which is hilarious. Thank you for this hip tharya
9766800	9768240	um
9768240	9770240	But that's like true
9770480	9772080	real and true
9772080	9778400	Because what what i'm sure one of them was like they were arguing over a helicopter detailed design
9779120	9782320	Either in the cockpit or something to do with a helicopter
9783040	9791200	And then someone was like so tismo. They were like no, you're wrong and here's why and then they just like flop down these like
9791840	9794240	Documents that shouldn't be publicly accessible
9794800	9797920	Um, and it's happened multiple that law
9800480	9808240	Okay, we're singing a second song i'm going to assume by the third song we will progress to the next story for element because
9808480	9809360	good

9831520	9836400	Bro bro was like slams on desk. See I told you so
9838320	9840320	This gen is blessed truly
9842000	9846640	Like it wasn't even one country leaking the info it was all of them together just so that the the
9847520	9854080	Equipment and tanks and all that were accurate in game the next song. There's literally a joke zero days since last military league
9855040	9859120	She sees what you may become. They don't like to be wrong exactly
9860480	9865600	I'm just someone who gave me a song back home. We call that a deejay. She just stroked his chest
9866320	9870240	Then you worry mate. I just collect the songs beyond the cup that is already full
9871600	9873760	Look beyond the cup that's already full
9874640	9877200	Oji san says as he drinks Emmys

9884080	9888080	A certain dominance honestly actually elites really five and seven but other times they were export
9888640	9891520	Uh, restricted but it could be found online
9892880	9897120	I'm really proud to belong to the war thunder community for their dastardly arcs
9897120	9903520	The forest birds are warriors flee before the humans. These are drinking what? Hmm
9904640	9910880	The RDA must be gunning at me. I see actually all of them. You know what well matter all of them
9911040	9917840	We can't escape the the p-corp jokes. Now is the time to counter their attack or must be risked in times of need
9919760	9921760	Just all of them are at it honestly
9922800	9925840	I mean if you think about it as there is milk heels
9926560	9928560	So what would the other liquids do?
9930000	9931760	I don't know
9931760	9934800	I don't know. We didn't lure that that wasn't concepted
9935680	9936640	but
9936640	9944000	Up to you what you think the other ones do uh, what is this area? I seem to have forgotten this map. I actually don't remember it
9944720	9946720	The warriors here know the land
9947760	9951440	Okay, please be the last song because no more song missions, please
9951840	9957040	See if they can find big b. We could use this big b. All right. Just marry big b this much at this point
9957120	9959120	I feel love him so much
9959520	9962320	He enjoys crushing skulls of many totu
9962800	9964800	Totu for humans
9965040	9970240	When you have all I want to have squid ink spaghetti. Is that because of me? Be honest time to find out. Hey
9972400	9975680	Stroney, you didn't have she be you didn't hear she be the discussion about
9976640	9981280	No, actually this is one thing that I'm actually genuinely a bit sad about
9981840	9983840	Because I stream so much
9984240	9989840	I don't have time to watch everyone's streams and it ups it like it genuinely upsets me
9990480	9991280	like
9991280	9992240	um
9992240	9996640	I raided into mercy yesterday and she was playing oh mario
9997600	10000800	Or whatever the name of the game is. Oh, I've never seen it or played it before
10002240	10005440	And um, she was like yapping quite adorably
10006160	10008320	But I just feel bad that like I don't have time like
10009120	10014640	Just everything like when I popped into ac stream playing that puzzle game. Obviously she be live right now
10015040	10017120	I have terrible news, but I don't have she be
10018080	10022960	In my ear right now that you guys can't hear whilst I game and stream and talk at the same time
10022960	10027600	It's just not possible for me. I did not remember this map at all. I'm like, um
10030240	10032560	Let's go for it. Let's see what this maps all about then
10033520	10039840	What is this is this a run through type of thing?
10042800	10044800	Uh, no, this is a search
10046880	10050480	What is going on? Whoa, this is pretty
10054080	10059360	What is going on I need to learn to do that protection spell more wait
10060000	10064240	Why did the area just moved wait, so am I supposed to kill who's in the area?
10065040	10066560	Let's go
10066560	10070240	Let's see. Yeah, it's kind of shame that all your streams are overlapping
10070640	10076480	I will say one thing I did ask the girls to push on the first week to stream as much as possible
10076720	10081120	However, um, some of them are going to settle into streaming. Um,
10081920	10086800	I literally said to them do not even dare stream every single day
10087280	10089280	After this like you will be taking breaks
10090000	10093760	That like I was I've lit and they can all vouch that I told them straight to their
10094240	10100000	Faces don't you dare stream every single day? The only reason I can do it is because I don't experience
10100640	10106480	Burnout the only reason I would not stream is if I am on desk store. I'm not even kidding. Um
10107600	10113120	Oh, that horse is beating me up. They're jumping me. Wait use the ultimate use the heal heal heal. My goodness
10113120	10115520	You're so so what am I supposed to do here?
10117280	10119280	Stop
10122560	10126240	I'm gonna need to take these I'm getting hurt by something. Um
10129760	10131760	What I might get hurt by
10132960	10134560	I'm no idea
10134560	10138400	Right. Wait. Why am I just to run around these sectors or just
10140160	10143760	Stop it. Oh, there's more of them here. I need to kill
10144720	10146720	Are you forcing them to take breaks?
10147200	10150720	I'm not going to tell them not to stream because that's not my place to do that
10151360	10156800	But I will be worried if as time goes on like
10157600	10159920	I've noticed one of them are like non-stop streaming
10162240	10167840	But I will always like take their like if they say they're fine, I'm not going to question it
10167840	10170880	I'm not I'm absolutely not going to question it if they want to stream they can stream
10170960	10174560	But I would be a bit worried like hopefully, you're not like overdone
10176080	10180080	Because when I do it, it's fine. But when others do it, hold on a minute. I'm getting worried. I'm
10180720	10184480	I'm turning in a mother mode. Like, are you okay? Uh, is there something I could help you with?
10184480	10187040	Is there like a reason behind the scenes why you want to stream everything?
10188080	10190080	You know, I just want to make sure you're okay, baby. Okay
10191200	10193200	You're my wing. You're my wing
10193600	10195600	Oh my goodness
10195680	10198400	Uh, you literally just stopped me from doing that ultimate
10199120	10201120	Okay, objective quickly
10204720	10206720	Take care of your daughters. Yes
10207200	10212640	Uh, unironically, I've been getting nightmares about my daughters. Um, I had a nightmare
10213520	10215520	That I didn't
10215840	10219680	redirect into one of them and then they wanted to leave real or because of that
10220400	10223520	And I literally put in the message. I was like, am I real mommy now?
10223600	10229840	Without her many because I'm like, I'm literally having nightmares like of like, oh no, something's not going right
10230400	10232400	Or like I've done something wrong
10232880	10234560	Are we babies?
10234560	10236560	Here we go
10236560	10238560	Well, like, uh, I
10238960	10240960	I managed to get streaming
10241760	10243760	No streaming detachment anxiety
10243760	10247920	That's not the word is it? What way am I supposed to go this way? Um
10249440	10251680	Separation anxiety from the reefing
10252480	10254480	Um, that happened
10255120	10258640	And I don't know if I'm gonna develop it again for a little bit
10259280	10261280	Uh, plausible
10261760	10266000	But it's happened with the girls where when I go to sleep I get so nervous
10266720	10271280	For them and like I'm worried like something might happen to them and I'm not there to like help them through it or something
10271920	10277200	Um, help me return to but yeah yesterday was weird going after the two hour mark
10277200	10281120	There was so much time in the day, but the good news is I got a lot behind the scenes work done
10281280	10283280	Wait
10288640	10293920	Uh, I may or may not blast through that dialogue and I don't know a match is for her
10298000	10300000	Mr. Horsey that was me twat
10302240	10306240	Wait, what? Oh fucking spank you today. What are you playing at?
10306240	10308240	Oh
10309200	10310560	Protection
10310560	10313600	Where's the other guy? I literally just saw him or did I just get them both in the goal?
10314160	10318480	I assume I'm gonna score in her too. Yeah, okay. This is like an escort mission if I've ever seen one
10321200	10323200	Does she attack or does she not attack?
10324240	10329840	No, she just stands there and lets me do everything. All right, Hannah see have it and lazy bum
10330800	10337600	Lazy bum lazy bum. That's right. I'm calling you a lazy bum. What you gonna do better? Oh, I love that one hit like fly by
10339760	10346560	I swear and those it wasn't thing in the movies. No, it definitely is not. Is she getting attacked? No, she's fine
10350080	10352080	She is getting attacked
10360240	10363520	Uh, right we can progress to the next person
10364160	10366160	I'm very caring mama honestly
10366960	10368960	She's got worries. I'm like
10369120	10371600	I remember my mom telling me when she had me
10372160	10376080	She used to be a deep sleeper, but when I was born she became a late sleeper
10376800	10381680	And I'm like I I feel that because I've not had like a really good night sleep since debut
10381760	10384320	Oh before debut. I didn't even have a good sleep either
10385600	10389600	And the yap is the best part also in general a really cute thing for
10389840	10391520	now is that
10391520	10395520	They are yapping a lot, but not in a bad way. No, I love when the girls yap honestly
10396000	10398800	It's like so nice to listen to like their stories and
10399440	10403760	And the situations have been in they've been in like quite humorous situations. Um
10405680	10407840	And it's just like fun to hear different
10408480	10413840	People talk from like different walks of life. Like I know that sounds so freaking weird to say
10414480	10415520	but like
10415520	10416720	um
10416720	10421120	It's just fascinating and it just I just I just I just made it fascinating
10421120	10424160	I feel like you can also learn a lot from people's stories as well
10424480	10428240	Even if it's a humorous story, normally there's some sort of like thing
10428720	10433120	Or element where they can look back and giggle and be like, oh, I wouldn't have done that now
10433200	10437520	But like oh, isn't it funny at the time and like, you know, just a little good things
10437600	10441280	I should maybe do a reef link story time where we share stories
10441760	10445440	And it'll be like sure like I would be have to be like a google submission thing
10446000	10448000	And it's like oh share your
10448000	10450000	um
10450560	10456240	Share like a memory that makes you embarrassed and like I'll read them out and then I'll share you an embarrassing story of mine
10456640	10458080	um
10458080	10460240	Like that kind of stuff I would absolutely love to do
10460240	10464880	I feel like those kind of interactive streams are quite funny and we can all like kind of have a week giggle at each other
10465360	10468480	Also, you guys must remind me to brush my teeth at the end of the stream
10469120	10472000	I keep forgetting to brush my teeth
10472880	10474880	for that guy and
10475680	10476800	Um
10476800	10480640	We need to do it together for 21 days so we can establish
10481760	10483760	our beautiful training

10642560	10644560	Because there's a horsey horsey
10645440	10647440	easy there
10648320	10655520	Would you let me read you and say easy there like this dire horse from the hit video game james karmann's avatar released in
10656160	10658160	2009
10661360	10666640	How many resurrections do I have I've actually not been collecting much samples does that attack me or you friend
10667520	10669520	Oh
10669600	10671760	Well, that got answered real quick, didn't it?
10673120	10675120	Whoa
10677680	10680160	Bit too much action on these roads for me
10681040	10684400	Bit too much my only I would say my only complaint about this game
10685440	10691920	Is that you can never freely explore the land like things constantly keep respawning which I'm not a fan of
10691920	10694960	I quite like the idea of like clearing out an area and then it's like faith
10695840	10698960	Every time you like want to come back. We're gonna unlock the tree of vision
10701280	10703280	This game
10703600	10706400	Well, this game did become PlayStation Platinum. Um
10707680	10712240	Uh, apparently there's a multiplayer mode in this game. I don't ever recall playing that as a child
10715520	10718800	So surrounding when is the history stream of yapping about the Irish potato family?
10719120	10721120	I don't know
10721360	10724880	I was going to do a teacher's day where we have like 40 minute
10725200	10727200	Or well, maybe 30 minute classes
10727440	10733120	So we do like English study and then we do like a french class and then we'll do like a pee class
10733840	10739840	And we're like literally I'll just instruct you on what we're supposed to do and you'll just hear me jump up and down in my room
10740320	10742320	um
10742720	10748160	Um other we'll do mass as well. I'll teach board mass is how we do it in
10749680	10754880	The UK or maybe maybe just Scotland. I don't know. Uh, board mass is brackets of division
10755600	10760720	multiplication addition subtraction is different what the heck am I supposed to do? I wasn't paying attention
10761920	10766400	I think I'm supposed to collect things in this area. Yes. I am. I am slight things in this area
10767040	10769040	If that's the case in viz right now
10770720	10776160	Right, we'll just do the outskirts of the area because I think that kind of highlights what the dealie was
10776240	10778240	Where the heck
10780320	10782960	Uh, right there's one
10785280	10789040	I can hear lots of enemies, but I'm trying not to engage in any of them
10790160	10795920	I am gonna get him to not attack me by doing this. Nope. That was not
10796880	10800800	That wasn't it. Oopsies literally just aggro time on me for no reason. Oh, there is
10801520	10804720	We need one more pink tentacle
10807120	10809120	Oh
10809440	10811920	Oh, there is there is right. We're safe safe safe safe
10813360	10815360	To ease
10815920	10818800	We're gonna try and avoid all the fights because you really do
10819280	10823840	Once you do like if you engage in all the fights you really do get like tangled up in like all this time
10824480	10826800	Strongly teaching man, and it's not gonna go well
10827360	10832320	But like we would do all the most basic covers like we do biology we'll do physics we'll do chemistry
10832800	10838800	And like a full day and the way I was going to do it is we're not allowed to progress until you guys actually give me the
10838800	10840000	Correct answer
10840000	10843920	So depending on how fast you do it, we'll get through the school day like really fast
10844560	10848640	But like I'll put a little teak. I don't know if I can get looking teachers. I don't know
10849920	10851920	Maybe put like a graduation cap
10853040	10857840	Oh, wait, hold on. I just realized I'm not gonna light on I think that's why my mouth track is being all funny. Hold on
10858320	10860320	Hold on professional streamer moment. Oh
10862320	10864320	Oh
10865840	10866800	There we go
10866800	10870480	Right, I'm gonna recalibrate just because I keep seeing my mouth is kind of like wiggling away
10870800	10874560	I assure you I'm not about to cry, you know when someone's about to cry and their mouth starts wiggling
10874800	10876800	That's what I do anyway
10877040	10881440	But we will recalibrate a little cheeky recalibration
10882240	10886720	Nope, and uh, my blanket is currently trapped around the microphone. That's not fair
10887440	10889840	Mr. Blanket, please please work with me here
10889920	10891920	Oh
10892160	10896080	Your math phobia, I hope you don't have a math phobia numbers. Oh
10898400	10905440	So I was calibrating so I had to go into that silent. It's like, oh you scared the numbers. Oh multiplication. Oh
10906640	10909920	Yeah, that terrify you that stuff made out of nightmares for you. Yeah
10912000	10914240	Where's these horses? Let's go
10920160	10927520	You could give a history lesson on the battle of bannock born. I absolutely will we'll do we'll have a scottish lessons stream
10929360	10932800	Segment for it because if we're going to study english, literally
10933520	10938800	Then I'm gonna stay off the horse for this. I think I'm just picking these people up horse. You're in my way. Thank you
10939680	10941680	Reunite the hunters
10946080	10948720	That's all I really had to do
10950800	10952800	Well, we'll just
10955280	10961280	I'll just let them fight in the background whilst i'm in a cut scene. Don't worry guys. You're doing fine. Keep it up. No, you're fine
10961680	10963680	You're fine. You're doing fine
10964560	10966560	What's your favorite protest?
10967920	10970080	What does that mean? What's her protest?
10971920	10973920	I don't know what a protest is
10974640	10978720	Oh my god a veiler group calibration with the math because apparently all of you struggle with math
10979600	10980880	literally
10980880	10987280	I like playing incremental games, but you know, I don't actually like doing the thinking part when it comes to numbers
10988320	10990320	So, yeah
10996320	11004480	Yes, this is correct. This is the way to victory to victory to victory. This is the way to victory and this is the way we'll go
11004720	11006720	Hmm
11008240	11010240	I'm actually so fast on this
11010880	11015600	Is this faster than the Thanator? It actually might be, you know, oh, there's so many samples around here
11015680	11020560	I'm just gonna check. Oh, I'm actually max on revives. I've got five revives
11021360	11027760	Oh, we're getting ready to attack. I can see you. You have done much for my clan. We stand beside you
11028720	11031680	Even Shibi was struggling with the puzzle. Oh puzzle games are
11032240	11034240	Hmm
11034960	11038320	I asked Emmy and AC see if they would maybe collab on
11039520	11041520	We were here that puzzle game
11042000	11043280	And they had to swap the game
11043280	11048320	They gave it a little short like just as a five 15 minute practice and they were like we're not playing that and I was that's fine
11048320	11054240	That's fine. You don't have to play a spine. He's fine. I wanted to see if I could do it with a wiefling
11055920	11060080	But then I would have to like if I could do it
11060400	11061440	Oh
11061440	11067760	Yeah, they wonder the rock killed me. It's sort of a fucking entire boulder on my skull. Are you joking?
11068160	11070400	How is that supposed to know that was about to happen?
11071600	11075360	That's outrageous. Oh map design change. What's in here?
11076560	11078560	Enemies got a lot of oh
11079200	11081200	Can can you guys really not see?
11081920	11083920	Oh
11087200	11090720	Right, okay, I give up I give up that's really annoying
11092560	11094560	What's going on here?
11094960	11097440	I've done protection. I've got knocked back
11097440	11101200	I hate when they knock you back because that's when you can just absolutely eat
11101840	11103840	All of the damage that they're laying out
11104880	11106880	Which is not good
11107760	11110880	Yeah, like I'm literally getting so injured
11111200	11113200	Oh
11113440	11115440	This your spawn point is it behind here?
11116160	11117440	You suck
11117440	11119600	Get rid of that spawn point get that spawn point out here
11120480	11123200	We're straight ahead. Oh, we're just like literally going back
11129440	11131440	Could you do a lesson on maricuna scots?
11132160	11133760	honestly
11133760	11135760	Oh my god. I have to make you do force
11136640	11142640	Force peak re religious education as well. Actually, maybe not. I may not be that fun for what people
11144640	11146640	I'll make us sing a song
11158480	11161760	Force choir, I'll have to get us all to sing at the same time
11162240	11167280	But it has to be it has to be like internet culture songs because it's fun. Why are we why did
11168160	11172320	Why did he just oh, there's a dog there but a doll dog with a book?
11172960	11174400	um
11174400	11178720	I don't know what songs I could make us sing it would have to be related to
11180320	11184240	Meme culture. What did you guys think about all the songs that made the girls sing?
11186320	11188320	I freaking
11189040	11191040	I
11191360	11195520	How am I supposed to avoid that? I'm sorry. There's absolutely no way you can dodge that
11196000	11199840	Unless you went to attack but if you am I am I going the wrong way?
11204320	11206320	I've gone horrifically the wrong way
11206640	11213360	Uh, sorry, I had to like really think there. I think I'm actually about to lose my dire horse coming back here because of this car
11214640	11216320	Yeah, wow
11216320	11217600	literally
11217680	11224960	Brian what if the more games show with the girls where every stream the questions are about a different subject eyes
11227280	11232080	Hold on. I'm getting absolutely right. Hold on protection and biz. Let's go. Oh and biz
11233440	11239200	Sorry, right. Hold on narrow. Thank you for the tip. Hey, Shawnee. What if veal or game show with the girls where every
11239520	11243920	Stream the questions are about a different. I don't know that. Sorry. I can't do two things at once. Hold on. Hold on
11244720	11247120	What way to go stick to this one?
11248240	11250240	Oh
11250480	11256240	I'm no I'm no I'm no smart enough to do two things at once. I'm gonna have to read that all over again one more time. Take it from the top
11257200	11262800	Hey, Shawnee. Why is there more enemies? What if veal or game show with the girls where they stream the question?
11262800	11267520	There are different there the questions are every so we do have one game show
11268080	11272240	Coming up that I'm gonna make I am going to reach out to a
11272960	11274960	creator
11276320	11280880	For possibly they already do a game show, but I was gonna set it up for them
11280960	11283760	So literally they can just rack in all the money
11284400	11288400	If you didn't know the easiest way to collab with people is to do all the work
11288480	11292480	But let them like take over type thing. It's the most like
11293360	11295360	likely way that
11296000	11301600	Collab opportunities will be accepted. So I've got possibly a game show that we're going to show up on someone else's channel
11302560	11305680	And and then I'll get like a highlight reel made
11306480	11308480	and
11308480	11312320	So I need to reach out to another creator, but I'm letting this first week settle down
11312400	11315440	Like it's been a bit hectic like trying to get a script manager in place
11315920	11319920	And we're trying to deal with this clipping issue that we've kind of already know
11320320	11325680	Things are a bit slow to be produced, but the girls are gonna have shorts that come out consistently
11326400	11328400	on their channels at some point
11330400	11332400	But like me and she be are literally lagging
11333200	11335200	for shorts because
11336400	11340960	I'm waiting to get us monetized first before we start putting shorts out
11341360	11346080	Because this is just a fact but shorts do better if there's something in them. That's a bit
11346880	11348880	humorous in that way
11350400	11354640	And the one that I got she be to do that a fauna speedrun challenge
11354800	11357040	Like that did well and all and I actually really
11357760	11362320	She got to show off her mine like a voice, which is absolutely perfect. Um
11364080	11368400	But um the other ones I actually got her to discuss
11371520	11373520	Milf body type v-tubers
11374080	11378800	Um, which I thought was super interesting, but I'm too scared to put it up
11379600	11385920	Right now because I would be mortified if the girls didn't get accepted for monetization
11386960	11393040	And this recent ASMR stuff. Jeez. I'm literally getting grenade launched. My goodness
11393760	11398320	Draw destroy the amp soup. Well, okay. I was gonna say where is it? Um
11399840	11405520	But there will be a lot of shorts coming up like one monetization is freaking dealt with
11406080	11407840	Uh
11407840	11412880	Because the stats updated but it only updated halfway through debut
11413200	11416480	So it says I still haven't reached watch hours even though
11416640	11418640	I think I have like a
11418880	11422960	Stupendous amount of watch hours now, especially after that assassins creed my
11423920	11429360	Assassin's Creed brother you'd stream almost has more views than my debut stream
11429440	11434880	Which is hilarious to think about because I streamed for so long and I guess people just didn't expect it
11434880	11437360	So like they came back in the stream twice at some point
11438240	11440240	You made 20 hours in two days
11441280	11446640	Literally like but after debut we all successfully had enough watch time at that point
11446880	11450160	It's just youtube has taken an entire week to update and today
11450320	11453600	I was supposed to be able to apply everyone's channel for monetization
11454160	11460800	But it only partially updated the thing. I think it's faster if
11461600	11462960	I
11463440	11465920	No, I just jumped down on this bridge that comes up. Um
11466480	11468480	But I only did it halfway through debut
11468560	11474480	So I need to wait another 24 hours for it to update and then I can submit all the girls channels
11474720	11476560	um
11476560	11480240	Like I've got an ASMR short of sheebie as well
11480720	11484720	But azure's short got denied for monetization
11485360	11492160	For advertisement and I think it's literally because her voice is just too strong. Like I don't know how
11492880	11499920	But her her voice is too strong. It needs nerf. Oh, I really don't want to go down if that's there. Can I destroy this?
11502080	11504000	Hold on
11504000	11506000	Did I just snake him out of that car?
11509360	11511360	Did that car just disappear?
11512160	11516720	I'm just going to invis through this section, but that looks like I snaked him out of that car
11517360	11519360	No, I clearly didn't because he's right there
11522800	11524800	You don't hear anything that's called
11525360	11527360	Uh, the ai cheating
11527600	11529600	What's this a bomb?
11529600	11531600	Oh a bomb
11533440	11540320	Oh a bomb. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. There's far too many of you right now. There's far too many of you right now
11541840	11546160	Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I've done it now. I've done it now. I've done it now. I've done it now
11546400	11550080	Come it. Come it. Come it. Come it. Come it. Come it. Come it quick. Quick. Quick. foot

11553760	11555760	There is I see it. I see it. I see it.� I see it.
11555760	11557760	You can do this we can do this as long as I do it
11558320	11561600	I'll hit a checkpoint right. Get me that heck out here. Oh
11562480	11566240	I don't have heal yet. I don't have heal yet a face of maneuvers a face of maneuvers

11588000	11589080	yes we will do that
11589080	11590800	aww no there's another one of these

11597520	11598800	what does that even mean
11599360	11602480	how ... literally i think it's because
11602480	11614240	very sadly sheepsters and Azura might have a cover-up for their... I don't know
11614240	11618080	I don't know I don't know what's going on we're kind of we're at the question mark
11618080	11623920	stage of what's the problem what's the issue but we'll get there okay
11623920	11627520	did I say thank you for the tip Nero? sorry if I didn't
11627680	11631680	but yes there are game show type-esque things coming up there's no horse
11631680	11636960	games November is my Scottish game show
11636960	11640240	I don't know if one of the girls might be interested in holding a
11640240	11648000	type of VTuber collab game show I'll need to see

11688480	11693280	giving me a path with no enemies you know what I'm not speaking ever again
11693280	11698160	that's ridiculous timing you've embarrassed me
11698160	11702000	I would I think that's my only complaint about this game it would be so nice if
11702000	11705040	there was areas that you could just enjoy for the beauty
11705040	11708560	which I know this sounds like such a weird thing to say but like I really
11708560	11713360	like admire the game okay I'm a little a little map design
11713360	11716240	admirer and like look at how much nature there is
11716240	11719600	I'm pretty sure there's actually a steam game that came out and it's all about
11719600	11724000	identifying plants in nature and I'm like honestly I wish I was like more
11724000	11727760	entertaining so I could play it but I'm not there
11727760	11730640	B or B I gotta go somewhere okay let me just pause the stream we'll wait for you
11730640	11734000	to come back
11734000	11736880	see you when you come back
11739040	11745360	oh it's not osha pet is it peta
11745360	11750720	peta that's that animal organization

11755600	11761440	oh new armor oh check that out oh I like that hold on
11761440	11765280	let's do a little wardrobe check wardrobe check oh wait whoa
11765280	11769680	my mobility is way down but my protection is so up from that
11769680	11773600	we might leave that up I'd rather like have more indefinite
11773600	11779600	protection than having to deal with all these issues
11779600	11785200	with constantly like getting barraged
11785200	11791280	uh right okay crystal crystal crystal let's beat them up
11791280	11796880	where's the crystal oh whoa whoa whoa steady on steady on
11796880	11799520	where's the crystal
11799840	11806400	I'm like literally jump-scaring these guys whoa you're on the crystal
11806400	11814320	right where is it I'm staring at it oh it's up oh wow okay I would have known
11814320	11820160	that it's like I was on that crystal there mission complete
11820160	11825120	ow my ankles no again protection is more important
11825120	11832480	uh the mobility I would say so yeah that's a big old horse ride
11832640	11840800	um can I let's go wait is that that is done uh huh uh huh yeah yeah just reading
11840800	11844560	the map yeah I don't know where to go I don't know where to go I don't know
11844560	11848160	really turn around uh I think it would be faster if I took a teleport
11848160	11857600	near this location um hello
11857680	11861840	uh I have to redo the set all right okay no I just fell through the map okay
11861840	11866800	classic open woman but there we go
11868080	11872160	I think we're actually getting pretty close I have never done that before I
11872160	11875360	guess this game I mean I did say that games have
11875360	11880320	problem with the vertical stuff especially older games
11880320	11883680	when it comes to mapping you you just fall through the map so many time in
11883680	11889760	older games right we are gonna teleport
11889840	11896400	where it looks like that and then just take a weird straight ahead
11896400	11903760	what a strange layout for a map a skill issue honestly childhood me would
11903760	11911440	never do that and yet here we are being an even worse gamer
11911440	11915040	pardon me I'm doing this with baby barbs this time
11915280	11921920	whoa I saw the truck I saw it wait I need to climb this
11922080	11927600	I don't know oh my I don't know if I can I get away with this
11927600	11932400	oh my god I can get away with it oh oh that poor horse I've just left it I'm

11944320	11948960	the RDA oh I would make the joke but I
11948960	11952240	don't have any more sound effects
11953360	11956880	magic your way to the other side of the map honestly
11956880	11961200	a bit cheeky to climb when there's an entire tank shooting at you
11961200	11965360	you're the best gamer I am especially when you rage oh no
11965360	11968400	I always feel bad when I rage because I feel like it's like
11968400	11973120	I like doing what I like to see and if I see like a streamer rage I'm like I'm
11973120	11976960	not sure I'm finding this entertaining but if you guys like it then sure I'll
11976960	11979920	tap into my ancestors rage we're almost out of here I'm
11979920	11984080	literally the uh is it the orcs in Skyrim I
11984080	11987920	think their special move is called ancestors
11987920	11992720	ancestral's rage and it's like 10% more or berserk type thing it's like 10
11992720	11996240	percent more damage what's going on here
11996240	12000720	the last song right look for the thumping when bumping
12000720	12004800	nope there's a fight why is there a fight I thought I just had to interact with
12004800	12008720	the tree did not have to interact with the tree
12009360	12012960	oh okay okay okay okay we're doing it we're doing it we're doing it we're
12012960	12016000	doing it we're doing it come on let's do it before they destroy absolutely

12026560	12030080	are they gonna blow the tree up before I get the phone
12030080	12034080	no the ancestral stuff was done man uh berserkers rage is the one that works
12034080	12036480	out ah
12036480	12040960	uh right invisible because we're not out here trying to have a billion battles
12040960	12045200	every two seconds yeah probably feedback on the game
12045200	12048400	kind of calm down on how many enemies you put on the map because they are
12048400	12054240	constant hello barrier did this did this game really say go
12054240	12058000	round no way this game just say go around
12058000	12061920	oh no it's fine it's fine it's fine

12074800	12078800	to home tree home tree
12083360	12087040	I think we're getting there I can't really recall how much more to the campaign
12087120	12093120	there is this would be three songs and if we're playing the classic video game
12093120	12101680	rule uh I can't remember what comes after the third song
12101680	12108080	I swear if it's like go for another song on my right wrap it up wrap up wrap up
12108080	12110720	you're taking a bit too long now take a bit too long we're gonna need to do
12110720	12113760	something a bit more than home questing but look at kill that armor looks
12113760	12117120	honestly that's pretty thick
12117200	12122000	it would be so cool to see this game remastered but I do not think it sold
12122000	12126080	well I think it hardly did it it's numerals
12126080	12135760	hello we love James Cameron you did it again

12167520	12171040	people believe in you yet some fear the
12171280	12175920	cute spirit inside you let me get bed ammo
12175920	12181520	he blames you for much there was just a whole missing voice line I think
12181520	12185360	it was so hard to come to our realization
12185360	12192640	that Christmas is summer final song it's not natural but
12192640	12196640	it's a pretty decided once I wrap up a business

12226720	12234000	don't know what this I'm afraid my memory is getting very hazy now for
12234000	12236400	the game
12237200	12242240	you'd kill for a warm Christmas it is bizarre I did not enjoy it like I
12242240	12248720	phoned my family and I was like oh I wish it was
12248720	12253360	cold I wish it was cold um because you do get
12253360	12256800	snowy Christmas in Scotland which is really pretty when it does happen
12256800	12261280	when the stars align it's very nice
12261280	12267520	hello I haven't given up where is the shot
12267520	12272720	where sky machine has crashed you are so mean I've literally been helping you
12272720	12275840	for ages I'm sorry but I think enough times
12275840	12282560	pass where he should be alright with me and you're giving me any nonsense
12282560	12285760	you make it sense to miss to go it's very beautiful where is that
12285760	12291280	what the heck is this map I do not recall at all
12291280	12295520	memory's getting a little bit hazy I can't see where the map ends because of
12295520	12298640	that very top right corner very clearly that's where this map
12298640	12305040	location ends but I don't know what happens here
12305120	12312400	can't believe it right I think we're just gonna leg it as we always do
12312400	12316320	but yeah like these look the map details like the
12316320	12321040	kind of the further you progress the more damage the areas are and
12321040	12325280	you know it was trying our hardest but like there's only
12325280	12330960	only so much awa can do and the navi can do against literal bullets I have to
12330960	12334080	admit bows versus bullets like I'd rather have the
12334160	12337680	rather have the mp5 or the famine some way why did I get off I think I just
12337680	12340800	want to activate that oh well I needed to get off anyway
12340800	12344000	because I need to cut open this fence I'm itching my little
12344000	12347200	what was this Elden Ring oh you've got me
12347200	12350160	let's see
12350560	12354880	uh we'll just avoid thank you for spawning in but
12354880	12357760	not really interested me wait am I going the wrong way
12357760	12362160	no I can go this way I just happened to walk right into an RDA
12362880	12365360	aligned and I need to cut this fence as well
12365360	12368080	get in the scraby
12368080	12371440	I might make a cup of tea shortly and go for a peep because we've actually not
12371440	12376640	peeped in three and a half hours of uh unless some of you guys have a
12376640	12380640	detached headset and then you go for a peep
12380640	12386400	whilst while still listening to the fact that there's a very high
12386400	12389840	chance that a wiefling has dropped a loaf of bread while
12389920	12394080	listening to me ramble on stream that's right wiefling I'm on air
12394080	12399200	I know exactly what you're up to mm-hmm I know what's going on
12399200	12401440	hmm
12401440	12405920	a drop a loaf of bread honestly drop apparently the there's another same
12405920	12410880	which is um drop the kids off at the pool
12410880	12417840	which is uh guilty is charged oh no it's been confirmed
12417840	12421040	you know when people say like oh what did you what what did you think would
12421040	12424160	happen like when you became a beach over etc
12424160	12427760	uh apparently I didn't account for someone dropping a loaf of bread to my
12427760	12433920	voice so there's that yeah um yeah quite a few unique scenarios
12433920	12437360	definitely definitely
12439280	12443680	how are you ever like he teleports around this map for fun I swear
12443760	12449840	okay hello no the shard was blown up
12449840	12454880	not sure the first voice is not sure oh I'm being called the first voice I'm no
12454880	12458640	longer dreamwalker oh my tummy rumbled if you heard that
12458640	12462400	listen into your patreon audio we'll see in a man
12462400	12467520	about horse I didn't want to miss a second to your
12467520	12471280	beautiful voice though if it's any consolation
12471280	12475840	you make dropping and you make dropping a loaf of bread hell of a lot more
12475840	12481440	comfortable you're done you're out out you're done
12482240	12486320	we would be not identifying as loaf of bread droppers
12486320	12491520	oh that came out nowhere
12493760	12497920	oh my poor horse I should have picked up a new one
12497920	12502080	because he's so low health I want him to retire and live a happy life
12502080	12507280	but I don't think that's gonna is it left or right it's this way
12513840	12517920	she knows
12518640	12523200	oh right I'm gonna pick up this horse here because I would like this one to
12523200	12526720	literally retire and have a happy life excuse me mr horsey
12526800	12532880	see you go enjoy yourself and heal up and then I'm gonna have you
12532880	12536640	tada and then everyone lived happily ever after and the
12536640	12540800	and everyone around me clapped yay
12541360	12546160	how else are we supposed to listen to the field shoot honestly though
12546160	12552800	um wow that's a lot of power
12552800	12557600	a lot of manpower behind that they're destroying the crystals before we get
12557600	12561520	them is someone telling them this
12562880	12566800	how do they know where the heck all these crystals are
12566800	12571600	right we'll finish this map and then we'll go for a tinkle and I will
12571600	12576560	also go for a tinkle and make a cup of honey tea to help soothe my poor voice
12576560	12580400	it's really bizarre my voice is so broken
12580400	12584000	but the microphone makes it sound so like fine
12584000	12588000	and not broke wait can I just teleport no I can't go fast
12588000	12594480	um so I sound like pretty normal on stream
12594480	12601440	my voice has been broken since uh the the violor exposed violor stream
12601440	12607200	um I don't know thankfully I've managed to record a lot of stuff in advance
12607200	12611440	but don't be surprised if you get a patreon audio
12611440	12615440	and I'm just sound like a frog I'm like yeah you're like my good boy
12615440	12618800	and you're such a good wee boy and you're like my good boy
12618800	12623600	like it's getting it's getting curious it's getting curious
12623600	12628240	and you are a demon how is it you live
12628240	12631360	with so many honestly that's kind of a fair assumption
12631360	12635200	there's something I gotta tell you we must have been
12635200	12640240	those who have fallen so we attack
12640240	12643760	do some patreon videos in full pantomime
12643760	12646640	you get 3d models and start like mime in the axe
12646640	12648640	yeah
12650400	12654160	wouldn't be the first thing patreon box and audio in me
12654160	12658000	a little frog voice moment you let a horse die
12658000	12662240	oh it was a mistake I can't save them all but I can try my best
12662320	12665600	also I just want to say I am still getting
12665600	12670320	marshmallows of people asking me to save Vichu oh that horse literally just
12670320	12673920	perished right before me oh where am I supposed to go
12673920	12677120	uh that's quite far to go by foot but we don't really have a choice there's
12677120	12680320	one more horsey horsey
12684240	12688560	skull horse skull women sound really cute when their voice is
12688560	12692720	cracking and squeaking from over using their giggling
12692720	12697120	asking you to say what no they're they're asking me to save
12697120	12702640	certain Vichubers and I said it on that stream the other day and like we're all
12702640	12706880	having a giggle but I woke up and I got a few more and I'm like
12706880	12710880	I don't I don't know if it's refling sending it or whatever but like I'm
12710880	12715360	gonna be on it oh it's full health again and I'm gonna be honest
12715680	12720160	I hope it's understandable no I can't literally save all Vichubers
12720160	12723680	you know I'll try my best to look after those who have faith in me
12723680	12727280	um you know I'm a big believer in reciprocation
12727280	12732320	in terms of you have faith in me I have faith in you type thing
12735920	12741920	well I better not am I on a timer and I don't know it
12742800	12745840	I think I'm on a timer
12746400	12751120	gotta go gotta go gotta go I know I know I know I know
12751120	12753920	I'm trying
12754480	12760000	I can unlock this uh to your vision you can lead from the front and try and
12760000	12765600	change I think the content creator owned
12765600	12770000	agencies definitely have a place
12770080	12776080	um definitely have a place um because I think people are a bit
12776080	12781680	mmm it's not for me to say what the the overall feel is but I think
12781680	12784640	for me anyway it was very disappointing to learn
12784640	12788480	how little creators that sign up for these agencies
12788480	12794560	get in exchange for all their hard work because did he just go ahead me
12794560	12799600	did he just go ahead me um hello hello human resources
12799600	12804080	do you guys have human resources on pandora because um what was that
12804080	12806720	excuse me
12808080	12811440	uh yeah because we have very specific it's unlikely but
12811440	12817680	um I did actually learn about another agency that did have a higher split than
12817680	12820640	the 5050 which I'm I'm quite happy to hear about
12820640	12825040	um so I think hopefully over time that 5050 split
12825040	12828400	gets raised because I will tell you right now
12828400	12832000	for however hard the girls work on stream it's absolutely nothing to do with
12832000	12834960	me I don't tell them what to do they do it all themselves
12834960	12840800	um and I believe that they should take home the lines
12840800	12845280	share that's just me but not every agency that there feels like that
12845280	12849440	um but if you value um if you genuinely like
12849440	12853680	as a special thank you is what wait hold on I'm getting absolutely annihilated
12853680	12856960	here Danny take these down I think so

14354960	14359760	because literally no one has played this game does anyone I wonder if there's a public record
14359760	14365280	of how many copies were sold because I just feel like it's such a thing way too late for this stream
14365280	14372240	but I'm also one of the two people I played yeah everyone thinks I'm playing the new avatar I think
14372240	14376720	possibly I don't know actually I don't know what the new avatar games called because this one's called
14376720	14381520	James Cameron's avatar the game well we've got to say oh my god mansion armor twinsies

14437360	14445520	oh I almost made it past all those RDA soldiers oh I'll take it I'll take it a couple paths yeah
14445520	14452160	I assume when we play the RDA side we're literally just playing the exact same maps but doing the
14452160	14460880	opposite of the bad people and destroying everything wow I need prediction on right now
14460880	14467280	I'm getting absolutely nailed them right now I don't want to use healing because I actually
14467280	14475520	do a full health bar when I heal let's speed on speed on through okay this looks more navvy
14476000	14482080	paid four hours is it gonna be another endurance stream I think so originally it wasn't but
14483600	14489040	I got paid money to play the RDA side and you guys are holding my hand through it because I am
14489040	14496320	genuinely afraid of what happens hello how do you do I'll hope lies with you dream walker excuse me
14496320	14500800	I'm actually called the first voice I'm no longer I didn't I don't respond to dream worker I'm the first

14533200	14538320	is actually a timer on the door I don't know if any protection spell yet I'll wait until I'm getting
14538320	14542480	whacked I don't I'm not experiencing the whackinging yet
14545120	14553200	uh right okay I think the game's actually being mildly oh my god imagine three navvy
14553200	14559520	ganging off on you it's over it's over I wouldn't even bother just put the gun down and be like
14559520	14564160	actually I'm gonna be one of you oh wait oh sorry I'm getting distracted protection I've casted
14564160	14570240	protection okay there we go gang violence gang violence we're literally ganging off in the
14570240	14576800	upper guy oh that's terrible absolutely a wipe in the night I guess
14579520	14586960	one for you one spank for you and one for you okay we just need to defend the village now
14586960	14594400	without perishing which I can definitely I can hear someone getting hurt over here oh yeah
14595360	14602000	one for the true warfare I think we're cheering each other on we responsible
14605760	14610240	okay I'm gonna need that prayer to pop again because now there's mecca's getting involved
14612720	14614000	demon skin parish

14657520	14667200	oh money talking money talking okay oh um oh camera angle steady steady right we've got one more

14679760	14691360	one two three four five ultimate yeah honestly that ultimate is actually pretty sad so I'm gonna
14691360	14696480	heal because it's not gonna all heal when we're not around it because the enemies keep coming back
14696480	14708160	so protection oh there's a mecca over there I think oh it's out of bounds wow I just do this for now
14709760	14717520	oh no no I won't someone's getting me oh maybe not maybe not the navi are actually helping hold on AI
14717520	14722560	that actually attacks the enemies that are around you hold on a minute this game's 2009 and you're
14722560	14729440	telling me they nailed it here and then games afterwards it's my biggest like great with video
14729440	14736000	game development if you have allies that can attack but they do not actually end the enemies
14736000	14742480	looking at you lego franchise looking at you and they actually don't help at all
14743440	14746560	I don't know if the newest lego star wars they actually do help
14748720	14753520	is she playing this because she genuinely likes it or is she as a warning to the rest of us to avoid
14753520	14761920	this it's my childhood game I do like the game I'm just rubbish at it I like the navi side I've
14761920	14772800	never played the RDA say whoa oh that's so cool looking I think we get to write it

15004480	15011440	oh we did it we prepare a storm is in the sky

15023760	15027840	better than the rda let me take a little little uh drink too
15028720	15036400	congrats on getting second place for na vi any percent lemo let me submit this stream for it why not
15041120	15047440	another game down well uh we're gonna go for a tinkle winkle and I'm gonna make a honey tea
15047440	15057120	because my voice box is dying and then we're gonna do the rda so hmm so don't uh emmy I believe
15057120	15064240	shibi is playing class of 09 emmy bezu is doing an unlisted unarchived stream so please don't be
15064240	15068080	afraid to go check that out because I'll still be here actually I don't know how long she's gonna
15068080	15073120	go for that maybe I mean if it's four hours to do the rda side it is very rough on the voice to
15073120	15082480	whisper for four hours so hopefully I know boo rda rda hate me is making pin pals do math oh no way
15082480	15086800	I think to know if you play as a human you have multiple places where you can betray them
15088560	15092880	hmm what is that like all the way up to the very end
15094800	15099280	because wouldn't I wouldn't I just become a na vi at that point or am I still human
15100800	15106240	you wouldn't I have to do the evil side now unfortunately
15106320	15114800	I think I would ruin the run if I did it I beat the game already literally I think it's
15114800	15120160	four hours for each side yeah there's any rda hate but gun and flamethrower fun though
15120160	15125120	then every straight up ask you to switch like three four times oh do they I would know I love gun
15125200	15127120	shoot so I
15132640	15141920	right I'm gonna quickly go peep um and make a cup of tea I highly suggest everyone to stretch
15141920	15148560	your legs don't be afraid to open up any stream the now I will be roughly three minutes it takes
15148560	15154000	me like three minutes to boil the kettle and tinkle and all of that so please do fish pee absolutely
15154000	15161440	fish pee all over you right now um please don't be afraid to check out she be or any um I will be
15161440	15167280	a couple of minutes and then we will jump back into the naughty naughty human side bad human bad
15167280	15176640	human stinky human stinky stinky um but yes please do consider standing up stretching your legs
15176640	15182560	getting yourself a little snacky wacky um and then we'll jump in and you guys have to hold my hands
15182560	15185840	with the game because I am actually genuinely terrified to play with women all the way through
15185840	15190080	his camera angle so freaking low to the ground and if I've got big navi running at me I'm actually
15190080	15196400	going to be scared so yes hopefully I really hope the game doesn't break while I'm awake for like
15196400	15202000	literally three minutes but the game's so old right please do stand up and get some rest

15989020	15992920	you guys like do witty comments I can repeat on stream I'm literally stealing
15992920	15996600	them and then doing that gag over and over again

16001600	16006160	hanging see when you when you come back because I'll still be like I work I don't
16006160	16011440	know if it takes four hours to do the RDA side then I don't yeah if anyone says
16011440	16014880	like they go work or sleep then sadly I don't think I'm gonna be there I think
16014880	16018840	this is a eight hour stream rather a bit more on the shorter side than what we're
16018840	16029800	used to but hey well let's laugh I don't know why but the crickets make me laugh
16029800	16039080	hmm let's see but what do you get when you cross a snowman and a vampire
16039080	16042280	frostbite
16045520	16049800	why was that so delayed I don't know why the crickets were so delayed that was
16049800	16056080	even more embarrassing that made it worse that the crickets were delayed oh
16056840	16069200	trying man trying all right ready for this we're skipping we're skipping even
16069200	16074680	the crickets aren't having it literally and we're showing up eight hours
16074680	16080760	built on the shorter side I'll let you like I've kind of mentioned I weave it
16080760	16085720	but like going offline after two hours I like sat and was just staring at the
16085720	16090680	screen for a little bit I was like what do I do now like I've got like an entire
16090680	16098800	day and I'm not on stream like it felt so weird like I don't know but I reach
16098800	16103840	them a smart collapse type thing which is really good hopefully make some fun
16103840	16114840	her little cheekies are definitely red I think I'm too German for the jokes are
16114840	16120160	really bad they are terrible the jokes are not funny and that is why we we use
16120160	16125040	the yeah because no one's laughing at the joke
16125040	16133760	honestly it felt weird like every week I do plan in a couple of injured streams
16133760	16138640	but the days that have shorter streams like the two are one like I really
16138640	16143160	enjoyed needy streamer overload I did not expect to enjoy that I looked up the
16143160	16153040	ending I would have gotten if I managed to not ignore her and like she was like
16153040	16157520	ready to become a god and like take down 10% of the world's population and all
16157520	16162240	that and I'm like whoa I so wish I could have gotten that but I messed up too
16162240	16168040	badly that's okay I couldn't have known you know play for them you know you get
16168040	16171720	none of the squat you got you and none of the squad laughing with that one I
16171720	16176680	giggle you're still sitting on your feet I'm sitting on my right one right
16176680	16184160	now and then left one is just wiggling the back of the chair don't abuse
16184160	16188080	what do you say
16188080	16195880	Nico from undead and what I don't know think of crisscross applesauce the way
16195880	16204320	you sit like that but I'm sitting on my foot like against my good way good way
16204320	16208800	to really enjoy streams of you I cuz I constantly like wiggle and move my legs
16208800	16211200	type thing
16216000	16220360	I was gonna be either putting pressure or moving them like cuz cuz I'm sitting on
16220360	16225560	my foot there's pressure against it so it's like keeping me stationary you get
16225560	16230560	a little grin over us a little mouth curve oh yeah did I have the ability to
16230560	16237360	make you put air out your nose a little just a little bit faster yeah I'm
16237360	16241720	thinking crouched no I'm not I'm not crouching I'm like sitting on them this
16241720	16248480	time but I do go on crouch on the chair sometimes like I was having to send all I
16248480	16251600	was talking to like eight people at once trying to organize something for the
16251640	16257680	girls and I was golem crouched on my chair because I was trying to like get
16257680	16262600	it done so fast so I could go to bed because I was exhausted I'm like trying
16262600	16266120	to like send this an editor and upload these files over here and send them off
16266120	16272920	and get the link and make sure it's a pretty like oh so yeah it was horrific
16272920	16281520	although they attacked me when I'm Navi as well so honestly I'm just a
16281520	16295080	wee bit deserved honestly these things are indestructible honestly I should
16295080	16302960	unplug my mouse and keyboard right now I'm not even paying attention honestly I
16302960	16311000	should but I think you could probably xp farm here if you had the tolerance part
16311000	16317920	because you're getting 50 every time and my it says I need 1,600 xp to level up
16317920	16329920	so yeah that's the pretty big xp farm ow my angry you're like I got paid to side
16329920	16334160	with the humans okay this is this is not me I'll put a little disclaimer at the
16334160	16340880	top of the screen not me not me you're not funny
16340920	16346720	but your accent is doing the heavy lifting fucking hell you're not supposed to
16346720	16353000	say that part out look that's supposed to be an inside thought absolutely just
16353000	16358440	got annihilated oh my I don't even know if I can come back from that oh that was
16358440	16367360	brutal I can't even come back from that I got 10 xp from driving over that plan
16367800	16377640	literally okay the dogs don't get like perish from the bungee which is fine
16377640	16393400	carried by the Scottish literally we do have to be careful we know do this do
16393440	16401200	the slow mo for me so I can actually oh jeez the way same box are you trolling me
16401200	16406320	right now I'm sorry but my bullets should have sprayed all over that goodness
16406320	16418480	gravy you just like oh I don't like that they win some pain either I just feel
16418480	16428680	so mean why are you being so mean you're a mean mean man cuz you're just
16428680	16436720	jealous oh my gosh I don't like it I don't like it I'm sure they were probably
16436720	16444120	win some when I was Navi but it's everything feels so meaner I'm going
16444120	16453080	in biz so I can get around here without attracting the other far away one what
16453080	16456760	did that do recovery gather ten seven pulls through our recovery okay my
16456760	16462120	second chance I heard that I heard that I knew you were coming here we go hello

16493640	16503880	do I not have unlimited ammo that's a bit of a problem I heard that I don't see
16503880	16508800	like cuz the camera angle is like way smaller cuz I am smaller as well makes
16508800	16519080	Pandora like even scarier the accuracy of our drunks

16779520	16784600	actually uh maybe I admit it's a little bit cool I'll definitely keep zoom
16784600	16789080	because it keeps me away significantly increased damage
16789080	16798200	oh but that one's calling an airstrike destroying every enemy and be aware it
16798200	16802000	takes a few seconds for the strike to our right maybe just defense I think
16802000	16806440	defense speed and health to get me out of there and whatever the last one was
16806440	16811680	invisibility and zoom get me out of whatever situation I'm in the video
16811680	16821240	but Jack black follow that signal yeah yeah so I'm about to go full fortune

16924760	16928040	I'm sorry, I think people in there are prizes not punishments
16929480	16931480	I'm not here to make enemies
16931640	16937240	Then we'll get along just fine. Now, please go and assist. Oh
16938200	16943080	It's gonna be so weird doing the RDA side you listen noob
16943320	16950120	I need you to grab me some flora listen noob. You ain't afraid of a few carnivorous plants. Are you aren't afraid of a flower among friends
16951080	16953320	We aren't friends. Oh, you need to learn quick
16953800	16957960	Okay, geez Louise talk about being unfriendly around these part
16958600	16962760	Make her blush for every bad joke of today's stream. Honestly, it's been pretty rough
16965160	16968520	Right if I remember correctly, there's literally
16969400	16973880	Yeah, um, okay. I've just noticed that we have infinite ammo on this gun
16974920	16976920	One that's not how they work
16977080	16978280	to
16978280	16986360	Actually, it's a wee bit of a pet peeve the one. Oh, we should watch those kiana reeve movies because they have the ammo reload thing, correct
16987480	16989480	Um, how am I trying to say it?
16990200	16992200	Like in movies where they just like
16992760	16996920	With a pistol and like pistol literally have seven max like if you're talking like the m7
16997320	17000200	Or something like that. Why where are the enemies? I can hear them
17002360	17004360	Oh
17004360	17007880	Well, I did ask to see them and no I can see them loud and clear
17008760	17010760	Geez the cam. I'm stuck on something
17011560	17017160	Oh, geez. I need I need some space. I need some space in order to like actually shoot please game
17018440	17021720	If you're not gonna give me aim assist at least let me freaking shoot
17021880	17023880	All right
17024520	17025880	Oh
17025880	17030520	They sound like puzzle gum from viva pañal. It's almost like they're based after flies
17032600	17034600	Wait, we're so
17037400	17039400	Johnson the babayaga
17039560	17045960	Wic yes that one we should watch those because uh lake heather actually accurate with the guns
17047800	17051080	It's very nice that they're accurate with the reading
17051720	17057320	I love the way john wick uses reloads to set the case for gunfights. I don't even notice that that's true
17060520	17062600	Unlimited ammo and mass effect cool joke
17064440	17066200	Oh
17066200	17068200	Someone said I might like mass effect
17069240	17073240	I've actually never played the series before but some said I might like it
17074600	17076600	I know he's called shepherd
17077560	17081240	That's about it. Oh, no, I don't need to do that at all. I'm getting confused
17082680	17087400	All the john wick movies are good. Yeah speaking of john wick. Have you played cyberpunk? No, I haven't
17088040	17090040	I watch
17090840	17092840	Cyberpunk but um
17094280	17098440	I am still absolutely heartbroken about rebecca. I am so sorry
17099320	17101320	is it
17101320	17103880	Her name is rebecca. What's the name of the?
17105480	17107000	The cyber
17107000	17109240	You're all with the rainbow hair. Is it lucy?
17109880	17116680	Is it rebecca and lucy like brotherhood? I'm getting brotherhood assassin's creep brother. Wait, it is rebecca and lucy
17118040	17120600	What the odds assassin creep brotherhood and
17121560	17123560	cyberpunk the anime
17124280	17129400	I am I am heartbroken over rebecca. I'm so sorry. I'm gonna see something so controversial
17129800	17131800	I have no comprehension
17132280	17139320	No comprehension on how rebecca just doesn't auto win like people are like, oh, let's see. Let's see this. Let's see
17140040	17141800	Lucy
17141800	17145720	Oh, listen, are you can you open your eyes and look at how perfect rebecca is?
17146120	17149080	I'll actually tell you some more development notes. Um
17150120	17152120	You don't have rebecca's voice
17152520	17154200	um
17154200	17159400	On the concept of icy obviously icy before icy, you know applied and all of that
17159880	17162760	We actually were quite happy to give icy to
17163480	17164040	a
17164040	17169720	Someone like that may have had a deeper voice because of rebecca from cyberpunk. So that's a fun
17170440	17173640	Behind the scenes. Um, I am not over rebecca. My first
17175000	17176760	True
17176760	17181160	I actually am interested in potentially cosplaying her for an ace more stream
17181720	17185960	Um, I think that would be a hoot and holler. Um, I won't show my face. Uh
17186920	17188440	I'd not
17188440	17190440	I'm not for that. Um
17191080	17193080	But I'm happy to do like
17194680	17195880	Nick down
17195880	17200120	Is the point. I'm going to take a sip of my honey tea to see if it's simple
17200680	17205800	But yeah, I don't know. Lucy everyone arguing about rebecca and lucy. I'm like, how is anyone looking at lucy?
17205800	17208680	rebecca's just peak like design everything. It's insane
17211480	17212600	Um
17212600	17218040	You know, it's a really sad detail if you haven't seen the cyberpunk anime close your ears for about two minutes
17219320	17221320	Um after no
17221320	17224200	No, I need to say this part out loud close your ears for two minutes
17224200	17229720	If you don't want spoilers about cyberpunk the anime the really sad fact is that rebecca
17230120	17236440	Got an upgrade to her hands after her brother died to the uh, the crazy guy because
17237000	17239640	Of the blowback she got from the shotgun
17239960	17246840	She never gets any root ricochet from shotguns anymore after that fact after that scene and it's such a sad fact
17247080	17249080	but yeah, um
17249560	17252680	Anyway, sorry back to the camp. Uh back to the actual gameplay
17254360	17256360	I'm just really passionate
17257000	17260040	The cyber cycle. Yeah, so the cyber cycle takes out her brother
17260200	17263720	But in that scene she shoots a shotgun at him and she goes backwards
17263960	17269800	And then after that moment her her her hand upgrades come in like her fisticuffs
17270200	17275960	Um, and she never experiences recoil when shooting weaponry. Um, and it's all because of that incident
17276600	17278600	And it's so sad
17278600	17281320	Um, but her design is just beautiful
17282040	17284040	Absolutely beautiful. What am I doing?
17284920	17286920	Yeah, let me drink my tea
17289320	17294360	The recoil so a little background on rebecca studio trigger was asked to change her because
17295080	17297960	Her design was too lollipop, but trigger went nah lollipops these
17299320	17301720	rebecca definitely influenced icys
17302520	17305480	creation with the hips area and the legs
17306040	17309320	I'm not even going to pretend otherwise at peak design. Sorry
17311960	17317320	I knew from the get go I wanted a troupe of tan, which is what emmy was and then icy
17318600	17319960	um
17319960	17321960	Is not troupe of tan
17321960	17322840	but
17322840	17328520	And but I did want her to have like the thickness of rebecca basically it is
17328840	17330920	I mean, I'm happy to talk about development. I know it's um
17331480	17336760	Like a zurra. We knew we wanted a charcoal and thick. So we've got a goddess and
17337960	17342280	Yeah, we just took it from there. Obviously. Um, sorry, let me finish this tea
17345080	17347080	Oh
17347480	17349480	Yeah
17350920	17357400	Adam sandler said you look like a cut of me. Are you wait in the game? I'm pretty sure that's from the game
17357400	17359400	I'm sure I've seen a clip of that game
17361640	17363640	Coming down with the
17365880	17369480	I'll actually tell you some other developmental notes, you know if I had a lighter voice
17370920	17372760	uh emmy
17372760	17376440	emmy's design and every in lore and everything if I had a lighter voice
17377000	17379000	uh
17380120	17382120	I would therefore be uh, um
17382600	17389720	I would therefore reflect if I had a lighter voice, but unfortunately I don't um, so, you know, uh, I take like the the big sister look approach
17391720	17399880	But yeah, uh, don't be surprised if an alternative outfits. Uh, I look a bit more true to myself. Uh, and I am
17402280	17404920	I suppose I'm a rebecca. How tall is rebecca?
17406520	17410280	Net away doing centimeters. Don't give me freedom units. I can't do freedom units
17411160	17417880	Um, but I guess rebecca's really very reflective. I think that's probably why I'm gravitated towards her so much as well
17418600	17421720	Uh, because I'm just like hey like I just love her
17423400	17427480	I'm gonna leave for the night. So here's your bro teeth brushing. Yes. Thank you
17428360	17432840	So burping my I'm gonna burp my teeth if I'm not careful. Hold on a minute. Um

18215640	18217400	Okay
18217400	18223800	Hopefully I don't mess up too many times actually doing the RDA campaign, but I have to admit it's like terrifying
18223800	18226840	I had no I thought the maps were going to be the same and I was like, okay
18226840	18229960	At least the maps are the same and I'm familiar with the paths. Nope
18230920	18232920	Hmm
18234440	18238200	I don't they apparently sold 2.7 million copies of this game
18239240	18245000	Yeah, that seems really low for like any game. I feel like that does that mean it flopped, you know
18249320	18253960	Mm-hmm, I'm gonna inspire people to get a McDonald's breakfast at this rate
18257240	18259240	Do it
18260200	18266280	A little hard in America they do 24 hour breakfast. So I'm jailed if I have to admit
18275080	18278680	You still think the tips are slightly broken or you're getting limited. Oh
18280520	18282520	Hey

18293960	18295960	No, that seems silly. That's the answer
18298200	18303480	I don't like break I don't like the breakfast menu of most fast food places. I'd rather try it for my main menus on
18306200	18312200	I know it sounds weird, but I love to make some nuggies a salad and put them both together
18313240	18314600	and wheat wrap

18535480	18539560	Absolutely, they're a good tree. Okay. It's a tree kind of not like a everyday thing
18541240	18542840	Hmm
18542840	18545000	I skip the jelly and only the peanut bar
18547240	18549240	I've tried the jar ones. It's
18549720	18551720	Pretty okay, but just okay
18552040	18555400	It's a thing they are raised on so as a result. They love it. Hmm
18556520	18561800	I suppose like iron brews my example if you don't drink iron brews a kid, you'll never have a taste for it
18563000	18565000	It's so bizarre and flavor
18566520	18568520	It's like that and
18568680	18570680	Japanese natto
18571240	18573240	fermented soybeans is a breakfast thing
18574360	18576840	apparently if you are a back-of-guy gene
18577400	18578280	and
18578280	18584040	You like it's really hard to enjoy natto unless you like force yourself to eat it over a while and then you get used to that
18586360	18588840	Yeah, like it's hard it's hard to get into it. Hmm
18588840	18590840	Hmm
18592280	18594680	Remember the old commercial from it made from
18596280	18598280	Gerders
18600280	18602360	It's cheap as heck and that's why we eat it so much
18603720	18607640	I've had peanut butter toast and banana and it's delicious. It's very nice
18607880	18611800	What's iron brews supposed to taste like they advertise it as ginger and bubble gum
18612280	18614440	It tastes like battery acid. That's the only
18615240	18616360	explicable
18616360	18621720	Way that you can see what that orange liquid tastes like it's battery acid, but nice
18624040	18626040	Hmm
18628680	18631720	Literally mountain juice the closest you'll ever get to
18633160	18637960	That it's just not positive. Sorry. I'm trying to eat and talk and I want to eat the food as fast as possible
18637960	18643560	So I'm not holding up the gameplay too much. Hmm. I take a drink from my chucky milkshake
18647080	18652920	Hmm, they forgot to give me a straw. So I'm literally just drinking out of it like some animal
18656520	18660680	Hmm do you see mountain dew yes, I said mountain dew
18663640	18665640	Oh dude, no
18666280	18670920	Mountain dew mountain dew mountain dew. Oh, whoa, that's so close
18671560	18675160	Mountain dew. Whoa, you can't tell the difference when I say that
18676360	18678360	Oh, that's crazy mountain dew
18679240	18682120	Whoa, it sounds like I'm saying Jay, but I'm no
18683080	18685080	I'm saying you
18685640	18687640	Oh, that's so cool
18689640	18693000	Did you drink my manju? That's weird
18695640	18700920	Hmm, okay, I didn't know I said a little kind on here now literally
18701880	18703880	Did you drink my manju?
18704840	18708280	Wow, why does it sound like that? I can hear it. No, dude. Do you?
18709720	18712440	Did you drink my mountain dew?
18714200	18716200	Dew
18718360	18723240	Yeah, I've tried my Andrew. I don't think it tastes like I'm brood. No, but it's only the closest thing
18723720	18727160	As a German, I feel not good here. Monka is bro
18727160	18729160	love
18732760	18740680	To do a drop of dew and to do that's all the same pronunciation
18749880	18751880	You now have a new earworm enjoy
18752600	18758600	All right, I've got two more nuggies left and then I've got this like burger McGrittle thingy
18758600	18762840	I don't know what it's called. It's called McMuffin. Well, we call it McMuffin, but I think it's called McGrittle
18766920	18770440	Mountain dew was originally made to be a mixer for whiskey
18774040	18777320	I don't know when I'm gonna do my first like drunk stream
18778120	18782680	I'm down for drunk karaoke, but I would have to rest my voice a day before
18785240	18790520	I was very nervous about it like the first time I ever did it, but now I know that
18791480	18794280	I'm not hitting them notes. So I'm gonna go for I'm gonna send it
18794520	18796520	Mmm
18804680	18811560	The original Coca-Cola had cocaine in it. Honestly, I just know that
18813480	18816920	It would just have been such a good time to be drinking that stuff, you know what I'm saying
18817320	18819320	Mmm
18820920	18829640	I'm sure I learned as well that, um, what did I learn that they used to prescribe like, um
18831480	18836040	I was a heroine they used to prescribe that if you were feeling rough back in the day
18839160	18842840	The drunk stream would give a hundred percent a hundred out of 10 bar, but I'm sorry
18843400	18850840	Here in brazil come to brazil many restaurants serve nuggets with creamy cheese or green green sauce
18851240	18854520	What would green sauce consist of would be some sort of veggie blended up
18856360	18861960	I would do cheese sauce definitely. Sorry, I'm looking my fingers like an animal
18866040	18871080	Most of the nasty addictive drugs started as medicines honestly like they were just having a good time back then
18871960	18876280	I just choked. Um, I don't know if you've ever heard about this guy called Sigmund Freud
18877000	18882120	He was absolutely wild and with his theories, but he was also highly addicted to
18882920	18884760	and um
18884760	18891560	Like a lot of his stuff got discredited, but like as time progresses, he gets proven right again and again
18891560	18906920	Also, there is the oh my god, this looks fucking awesome. I'm gonna take a big juicy bite for you
18913000	18916440	I went out yesterday after stream to get those american sweets

18934360	18938760	And she was like so nice and helpful, but she was so surprised with how much i'm buying
18939160	18945880	And I didn't want to be like, oh, i'm rooting them on a stream and all that. I was just like, I'm just really passionate about american sweets

18991880	18997720	I spent 53 dollars getting all of that stuff and they were like you got absolutely scammed
18998040	19001240	Like that's not even worth 12 dollars. I'm like, oh, okay

19245720	19247720	It's like spicy water
19248680	19250680	It'll be interesting to see what you actually
19251160	19252280	Hmm
19252280	19254760	I think that other drink was a and w
19255960	19262200	Root beer. I think i got like creamy. I think it was cream soda or creamy soda a root beer root beer

19290680	19292680	Hmm
19292920	19294920	No, kinder eggs
19295160	19298760	Actually, you know what's even sadder about the kinder egg ban the new realize
19299480	19301480	The only reason those children
19301880	19308200	Hmm past because of the kinder egg was because their parents weren't even paying attention to them
19308840	19310840	Which is such a wee shame like it's
19313160	19315160	Um out of everything
19317880	19319880	They have to ban it
19320040	19325560	Instead of being like hey here public announcement pay attention to your little ones because we didn't know
19326120	19327080	um
19327080	19329080	little ones explore
19329640	19335320	Using their mouth. That's why you can imagine literally licking any surface because you did it as a wee babby
19335320	19338120	It's an exploratory thing. You learn so much from it
19339400	19341400	Like for example if I tell you
19342360	19345960	To imagine what it's like licking a cold pole with rain
19347240	19351800	It's gonna sound i'm in danger. Why is it red? Why is it red? I saw that
19353240	19355880	I saw that I just entered combat there for a second
19356680	19360360	Monka is Monka is I saw that looks like I'm not watching your game

19368680	19373240	But it went red which meant I was under attack there. So I don't know what just happened
19378600	19382680	The kinder the American kinder egg man is real if I was a mean no I feel
19386600	19388600	Oh

20010920	20016600	Easy easy on the tilt. Why are you it's literally tilting me? I don't know why insist on tilting me
20017480	20024520	Squishy human versus navi with their carbon fiber reinforced bones. Honestly. Oh my god. I just missed the helipad as well
20025400	20027000	Oh, let me sit down
20027000	20029640	Get get me out of that. I'm gonna vomit if I'm in that any longer

20035640	20039240	You have rockets. Oh, I didn't know. Okay, that might be a little bit easier
20040600	20043320	I'm holding on good girl. Wait. Why are we thinking?
20047240	20049480	Must be because everything wants to hurt you here
20052600	20054600	Wounded are in down
20056680	20060200	Commander palco is ready for you. All right. How's the game so far?
20060680	20064040	We've completed the navi and we're doing the bad bad human side now
20064440	20066760	I'm going to keep this simple, but I don't know what to expect
20067000	20069240	I'm pretty scared of that because I've never played this side
20070440	20073320	This project starts with you our signal specialist
20074280	20078040	This is the sector you're currently in. We need you to go to these three ports
20078840	20081480	Once there, you must collect small shards of unoptenium
20082120	20084120	Oh, right. So we're literally doing
20084920	20086920	Directly the opposite. I mean that makes sense
20089320	20096280	But right now just get those three unoptenium shards. Don't worry too much about the details, writer. We don't have a lot of time
20097160	20099160	Okay
20100040	20102520	Good Falco out. You heard the man. You need to
20104280	20107240	Okay, yeah, I have a few questions. All right. I'm out
20108200	20115160	Uh, honestly, I'm like leveling up so much. I don't know I can call him. I've got weapons up for it as well
20117640	20119640	It's trying to hate humans
20124360	20126360	We are not human
20126760	20129240	And you make it a lot harder for yourself than it has to be
20129800	20130840	Hey
20130840	20135880	Look, I'm no very smart. Okay. All right. I think that one will have full health. Where am I? Am I flying? Oh, I'm
20136120	20138120	Is that flying?
20138200	20144280	That has to be flying. There's no way I can do that on foot. Sorry. There's no way right who's ready to get motion sick
20144840	20146840	me
20147320	20152360	Okay, let's first turn to the first wait, what one's closest? Yeah, that one is closest
20153320	20157800	Okay, first let's get hate so we don't bump into the walls or anything
20158760	20162760	Is this the ceiling of the game is wow, we're already at the ceiling. Okay, uh
20164120	20167480	Sorry ceiling of the map. My apologies. Hold on
20169720	20172920	Whoa, this is like humongous. What? Um
20175560	20179880	Oh my god, this is so much harder than driving an ikaran
20179880	20181880	Am I looking for
20184760	20189240	We're dead plant we're dead part. You know, you guys don't have a helipad here
20190280	20195320	Oh, there's navi down there. Oh, I'm gonna get rolled by them. Hold on. Wait. I can see transport over here
20195720	20199240	Which makes me think it's safe to put down the chopper here
20200040	20206360	I don't know if that's true, but we'll try it. Oh my god. We're about to go against navi for the first

20723320	20728840	And we can get the heck out here and we've done one of the four shard collection missions
20729400	20731640	I assume it's just going to copy the previous
20732360	20733720	um
20733720	20737960	Tactics. Hi. Hi. I'm me currently playing a horror game right now. It's awful
20738680	20740680	It's terrible
20741240	20743240	Oh
20743320	20747240	We did homework and brushed teeth. Oh, did you actually we're brushing your teeth, too
20747480	20749480	Oh
20751000	20756120	Is this gonna be another 12 hour stream no, it's gonna be eight hours if I don't die too much
20757160	20761320	I have successfully completed the navi storyline in this game
20761480	20764520	I'm having to go below because the map isn't letting me go above
20765160	20767160	Is this a dead end?
20770120	20772200	I'm not safe anywhere
20773480	20775480	Genuinely not safe anywhere
20776040	20778040	How do I do my bombs?
20779720	20781720	I don't know how to do bombs
20784840	20789720	You say I have bombs but nothing oh, wow, I do have bombs. Okay, well
20794040	20798360	Whoa, whoa, I need to go up. Holy crap. Can you go up so we can get like a bird's eye view on these?
20800360	20805240	Oh for goodness sake, where can I land there's navi everywhere
20805720	20808360	I can't believe it. There's people everywhere that live here
20809800	20811800	Oh, this controls are awful
20812840	20817480	I missed the falcon from halo and literally I'm getting wrecked and decked because of controls
20818760	20822680	Great, I need to destroy that ikram that's there. I don't know
20826040	20829160	I'm screaming but I think I'm at a render distance or something
20829960	20831960	Okay
20832040	20838280	This is terrible. Oh my god. This is awful. Can I fly in here? Excuse me? Pardon me coming through. Excuse me
20839160	20842200	All right, just land just land. This is awful land
20842760	20845800	It won't let me land. I can't believe it won't let me land in the tiny freaking
20846600	20848760	Right a crayons get my face
20851320	20856520	Right everything's getting annihilated. I think they're just right right. I think there's a landing spot over here
20856600	20860680	This is my guess because of the map. I know you can't see it because my big head's covering it up
20861720	20867320	Just just freaking get out of this thing. No get out. How do you get out? Hello?
20869720	20874760	Hello can I get out? I'm stuck. I'm stuck in this freaking chopper

20887160	20889960	Okay, there we go. There we go. We're actually out of success
20891080	20892760	I am
20892760	20895480	Playing the lovely game of please ignore me
20897320	20903160	And we're getting the heck out here and we're just absolutely speedrunning these because these are horrifying
20905720	20909640	Shawnee doesn't know what she's doing only
20911000	20913000	Wait, I'm probably really wrong
20917240	20919240	Where the heck did you come from?
20920840	20922840	Identify yourself she
20925560	20929320	I killed all yous on purpose and you've all respawned
20934280	20936280	Ah
20937480	20939480	Eat lead
20941720	20945080	The archers are probably the worst because they can pin me
20945080	20947080	At least
20948840	20950840	Oh
20952600	20957640	I know that other ones around the freaking corner. Yeah. Yeah, no way that still hit
20958760	20960280	Oh

21000760	21003560	Oh, this patch of dirt looks a bit different. I wonder if it was here
21005160	21009960	Where's the triangle somewhere over here? Oh, this patch of dirt looks slightly different. Okay, we did it
21011640	21014040	I played like two minutes this game back and then dropped it. Yeah
21014760	21015720	um
21015720	21021560	You have to play the navi side for it to be and remotely rewarding if you want to play a horror game
21022680	21024680	Feel free to uh
21031000	21033000	Oh
21033640	21036360	Midori how nice of you to show up
21038120	21042120	When uh, you could have done that like five minutes ago and help them some firepower
21043160	21046200	But why is on fire? Or is it just supposed to be dirt?
21051080	21054440	She's becoming wild i'm becoming the very thing I swore to destroy
21056520	21058520	Whatever keep going
21058920	21063400	All right, we've leveled up so do we get more armor?
21064600	21066600	Got yeah more armor. Thank you
21067480	21071560	Wow my reward for uh, whoa, whoa, whoa, you ain't taking me with you
21074040	21076040	I got hurt by that
21076600	21079480	Hey, the name's Trudy Chico. Hi Trudy
21080040	21083320	Falco's assigned me to make sure you don't go tango uniform on me
21083880	21085880	T you
21086760	21091080	Means you're safe with me. So let's get air to you. I ain't getting paid by the hour
21092520	21094520	Is that supposed to be the actual character?
21098280	21100760	Fighting for humanity isn't easy. No, it's not
21101720	21106920	Oh, okay. I don't even know that's good for that tea tea up any tea uppers
21108280	21110280	Freakin horror game honestly
21111560	21113560	Who said play this
21116840	21118840	Hydration check
21122280	21126440	Slipping tin of some sort of liquid doesn't really matter what it is at the end of the day
21126920	21131720	Oh, sorry. I've just why are you going to the side? I don't know but i'm drinking all horrible
21134280	21139480	She's just really enthusiastic about the wall. Oh, okay, little cheeky camera. I don't know why you're doing that
21139560	21144520	But I hope that's not joy con drift. Oh, oh, that's what I should name the gamer
21146120	21152520	If we ever had a 2.0 model joe con drift with an eye with the joy
21155000	21159000	Oh, I need to like a wink sound like a whee every time i wink it goes wheezy
21160200	21167720	Hello, ah writer you brought me the first harmonic. Let's get started. I still got some time before the emulator's up and running
21168200	21169720	The emulator
21169720	21172680	Ah, you don't know yet all in good time
21173240	21177640	Right now we need to upload that harmonic pop it into the module and let's see what we've got
21179080	21181080	Okay, sure
21181640	21183320	Here we go
21183320	21186200	What's happening now? What's all this stuff for doc?
21186840	21190760	Yes, let me explain the knobby have a unique relationship with the plan
21191320	21196200	Using a sacred site the tree of sorrows. They're able to link directly with the ecosystem
21196440	21201000	It's how they communicate with the entire class, but we're searching for something different
21201480	21206440	Our research tells us that there is another site that can help us sever the knobby community
21207560	21210280	You're after a site is undead for thousands of years
21210520	21213240	I place the knobby call the well of sorrows
21213960	21218040	If we can find this old door, this is why they aren't letting you name any more car. Honestly, I know
21219560	21221560	I'll never live down front of the bosom
21222680	21227480	But honestly we can take control best name. This is where your harmonics come in right?
21228200	21233080	We don't know where this dormant site is so the harmonic helps you find its location
21233160	21236040	I'm actually enjoying these cutscenes because I've never seen them before
21237000	21243640	We can triangulate the precise location of the dormant well of sorrows. Now. Let's see what your first harmonic shows
21247480	21252200	Excellent, did you notice the red dots? No, those are supposed to be a cutscene
21252920	21259080	With each harmonic, we'll reduce the number of red dots to the end of one. And number one, we'll be our well of sorrows
21259800	21261800	Do you agree with this plan?
21261800	21267240	Indeed. Now I'm finished. It's time to check in with Commander Falco for your next mission
21277240	21279240	I've got your next mission on deck
21279240	21286520	You're getting to the feeba officer midori will meet you at the top feeba a new area. They really didn't recycle any of the maps
21287320	21289320	She ain't no plumber. You'll be good with her
21289720	21295720	An escort. Oh my god, dug it help. Please. Please dug it help. I would love a freaking partner in crime
21297720	21301560	Those tree huggers are crying foul over this emulator all worried about
21303400	21308920	Monroe mentioned that what is this emulator? You stay focused on your mission writer
21309480	21313480	You start growing the conscience and you'll end up on the dead end of a navi spear
21314040	21315400	dismissed
21315400	21316920	Okay, okay
21316920	21318920	Falcon needs you to travel to feba
21319880	21321880	Hmm
21322600	21328280	That's where they made different maps for each one. I genuinely assumed it was just gonna be recycled. I can't believe it
21328280	21330280	I'm I'm I'm surprised
21330280	21332760	But we've picked up one song so we need
21333560	21339080	Two more songs and then I assume the third we destroy it or the navi destroy it before we get it
21339080	21341080	So it's like literally a complete 100

21745320	21753960	So that's my wee shotgun, which does them up cool. So that's my standard rifle. That's what I'm talking about. Maybe change this to what

21772600	21780040	A motor strike maybe? Yeah, that probably seems much more likely because
21782040	21784040	This is like really
21784680	21787960	Uh, whoa. No, I press get me on that leaf
21788920	21790920	Get me on it

21802600	21804600	No, what am I trying to achieve?

21811080	21813080	Uh
21813080	21817400	Wow, I just completely destroyed nothing. I'm so good at this game

21822440	21838120	I mean, it's getting weaker, but I'm not probably doing something horrifically. Well, let's be honest a
21839160	21841800	Grenade launcher sure. Let's try that
21843560	21845560	Okay

21875880	21877880	You were you went to great
21879560	21881560	Jeez, that was awful that fight. I'm
21883240	21890200	To say I'm confused about that fight is an understatement. Honestly. I hope I don't have to do that get a flame for next time. Thank you
21893400	21895400	Don't listen to them
21896920	21904680	Is the harem telling fibbers are you telling fibbers about my wonderful daughters?
21904840	21914600	What's that noise you guys don't want to deal with that that that navi right there. No
21916600	21919240	Hold on. Let me reload with some parish in you
21922680	21929000	Okay, we're both as bad at aiming as each other am I so small he actually can't hit me. I'm sorry to think that's what's going on
21929320	21931320	Hey, thanks. I owe you and your boys
21932040	21936920	You have straight she be streamers funny as heck only came in at the end. I don't even know what happened
21937080	21940760	I'm just here for this here and won't snitch. Oh, okay
21942280	21944600	Well, for those of you who are comfortably joining in
21945160	21949160	Mercy modis is going live in t-minus three hours at the moment
21949160	21953080	We are playing a game known as James Cameron's avatar, which is childhood game of mine
21953320	21957960	We have finished the navi questline and now we are playing as the bad guys
21958760	21961880	I am absolutely terrified of genuinely fighting the
21965320	21967320	The navi and so
21968200	21969720	We are
21969720	21976280	Just trying our best to get through the questline as fast as possible with at least amount of spikes as possible
21977240	21984840	And uh, the the game has aged a little bit in terms of like, I don't know what they were thinking these camera angles and stuff
21985000	21991720	Why does that look like it's gonna wallop down on me as I go past it? I saw that I can that is horrific. I've not seen that
21992920	21997400	Oh, there's noises being made. Oh, there's navi standing up. Okay. That's why that's why
21999080	22004280	We're just gonna keep driving to objective and everything's gonna be all right and
22004920	22009880	We're totally not playing horror game simulator at all. Honestly. This is terrifying as a human
22011000	22014200	Oh, please. Let me roll you over. Please don't get back up again
22015800	22021560	Oh, please mr. Rocks. Don't ruin this. I don't want to fight the navi
22022360	22026040	They are absolutely horrifying and terrifying
22027080	22031720	To me. I'm not oh that car's gonna blow up. So I'm probably gonna have to walk on my feet
22032840	22035160	Where or what am I supposed to do?
22036440	22041880	Nope, you're friendly and I'm just shooting at you. Sorry. Sorry. I swapped teams. My bad. I swapped teams. Give me a second
22041960	22043960	Give me a second. What am I shooting at?
22044040	22047560	Right, let's get some. Oh, no, that's a grinny. Let's not do that
22048440	22051560	Oh, oh, wow. Uh, that actually landed the grinny blundered
22052600	22053720	Why
22053720	22055720	Why are you not registering?
22056680	22061720	The game's age should be a bit she we can do no wrong exactly the here and have been
22063080	22065080	Trained well clearly
22066520	22068520	Are they
22068840	22070840	Is there supposed to be a shard here?
22071080	22075560	I don't I think I'm maybe just to help them
22081560	22083560	Uh, I will
22085080	22089320	See like I'm confident as soon as I have allies literally I'm having people help me with these fights
22089960	22092680	Okay, so it's a it's a clear amount mission. This car is gonna
22093400	22095000	Oh
22095000	22097640	I sure wish it came sooner. Oh balance mid-match
22098520	22100520	What's the blue senderman?
22100520	22106520	Oh, that's probably I'm actually terrified of them. Good grenade. Honestly. I don't even know how that hit. I didn't. I wasn't even
22107080	22109080	Hey, Strani, what's going on?
22109080	22112520	Playing a game called James Cameron's avatar complete the navi side
22112520	22118520	We are now playing the rda, which are the naughty naughty bad humans and I am absolutely terrified every time I go against the navi
22119720	22124120	Because they are so tall and lanky and scary and their arms are so long and
22125320	22127320	Getting shivers just
22127800	22133320	Right, we've got we need one more crystal from this map and then we can already move on out here
22133800	22137880	Thanks for your help. You should know that your men didn't die for nothing. I'm gonna make sure of that
22138680	22142200	Yeah, well then don't get killed. That'll just piss me off more
22143160	22145160	Man said he's here for the count
22146440	22149240	This game actually looks well made for a movie game
22149880	22151320	Hmm
22151320	22155400	Uh, I don't want to really write that because literally gonna oh my god
22155480	22159800	But to take all of that on foot with all the navi is terrifying
22167160	22171880	Can I repair it and we'll get like a little bit? Oh, is it stuck? Okay, hold on
22173080	22175400	I don't want to run this guy over. So I'm just gonna
22176360	22179640	Just need to edge it out. Excuse me mate. Excuse me. There we go
22180440	22185000	This thing is gonna explode the moment I encounter a navi. I just don't know what okay. I'm already
22185400	22187400	All right, hold on. Hold on. Hold on
22188760	22193400	This is not gonna go well. I can already see myself perishing in like five seconds flat
22193960	22197400	This is just the camera angle. Why did they finally?
22199800	22203640	I was not even like explode out just perish
22205640	22208280	Well, let's not do that again, I guess
22209160	22213400	So I have to do this on foot and be absolutely mortified the entire time
22213640	22215640	Let me put on the protection spell
22216120	22218600	That was the dumbest thing I've ever seen. Don't ever do that again
22219960	22224840	Where is it protection? Right, so I have speed protection health and blend
22227400	22228920	I can do it
22228920	22230920	I'm big girl
22231080	22236680	I'm already level three on the abilities. So they're actually gonna last quite a long time
22238360	22240360	Right, that's okay. That's okay
22240920	22243720	I'm a big girl
22245160	22249640	And this isn't scary to me at all. I'm not absolutely terrified
22250920	22255560	And there's not a bit of pee ready to come flying out of me once I get jump scared
22258920	22265080	We're cutting it. We're cutting it short. We are cutting it short. I have to admit this thing's about to unclog
22265240	22274040	Okay, that's fine. It's just plants plants are allowed to expel that thing. I don't know what the heck it does
22274600	22277880	I feel like it's gonna slam down on me and I just want to confirm or deny
22283000	22285000	I get XP for destroying plants
22287080	22289080	No way that's so silly
22289560	22291320	I know how to farm now
22291400	22297720	Right, we just need to go in this uncharted territory. I'm sure it'll be fame and there's not tons of navi ahead
22298680	22300120	I'll need these
22300120	22301480	doing
22301480	22303480	Raider fleamin cart. I think
22304680	22306680	It's okay. It's okay
22307240	22311160	Okay, this is gonna last a good cheeky 10 seconds
22311720	22312600	five
22312600	22313720	six
22313720	22315240	seven
22315240	22317240	eight nine 10
22317880	22319880	11 12
22320120	22323320	13 14 maybe 50 15
22324120	22326120	20 20
22326280	22332120	Oh, oh, I've never been happier seeing a human. How's it going? Oh my goodness. Yeah, uh long day. Yeah
22333640	22335640	Okay, there's a little fight going on over there
22336120	22337640	uh

22375080	22377080	We ain't looking good
22380600	22386840	Cleaning zenos for XT is always a perfect plan. Yeah, I'm thinking maybe if I find a turret I might try and level up
22389080	22390280	Hmm
22390280	22395400	If that hammerhead tells anything is that you ain't got enough damage for bosses monka ass

22445160	22449880	Even navi had bosses like those dudes that took a lot of killing and imagine the reverse
22450600	22456840	What does monka ass mean? It's a twitch emote where you look really stressed out and like, oh, no, this doesn't look good
22457080	22459080	I'm gonna get that
22459080	22461720	I'm gonna go backwards and get this
22462280	22464280	and
22465400	22469800	Oh my god, why is it such a horror ambience? I'm not even being funny
22471480	22478440	Like the leaves shaking about the leaves are like so violently shaking about whoa, what what?

22708120	22710680	How about this mate? I don't know. Maybe I should go in there right?
22712600	22717000	I'm just gonna bum rush it honestly. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. No, I'm not
22717640	22722120	I'm gonna go back for that mech that is the bravest. No, I'm getting out. I'm getting out. It's gonna explode
22722120	22725080	It's gonna explode. It's gonna explode. No, no run away from the explosion
22726440	22728440	We're going for the mech
22731000	22733000	Give me this thing
22733880	22735880	Let me in let me in
22737160	22740440	Okay, okay, let's see. Let's see what we're working with

22748520	22751080	Okay, okay, okay, let him get up. Let him get up
22752280	22755080	All right. All right. Not feeling scared anymore. That's
22755720	22760920	I've had blocked the way for this poor guy. I think so. Sorry mate. You'll have to figure it out on your own
22763960	22770520	Okay, okay, hold on hold on we're cooking by gas because this isn't terrifying
22772280	22779240	This isn't terrifying. I'm just kidding mech a time. I can't believe we're playing mech assault. See this game's just mech assault simulator
22780920	22784200	All right, let them come at me. Let them get up. Let them get up
22786440	22788440	Okay
22788840	22793320	Let them. Yeah, see they always seem to hide the navi behind the like corners and stuff
22794360	22798520	I'm just gonna let them attack and hope they don't keep respawning
22798520	22803480	And then it's safe to come out. Okay
22805080	22809000	Okay, okay now hold on hold on all is not lost
22809560	22813800	This might not be the most painful gameplay of rda side you've ever seen
22815320	22817320	It's called tools path
22824040	22826040	The wildlife cannot
22828840	22830840	Okay, hold on hold on hold
22832920	22838920	Can you aim why does it never register like I really just not my register. What's going on with this bomb?
22840120	22842840	It wouldn't even like hardly let me perish it
22844920	22846920	I've always loved the mech soup here
22848760	22850360	They're a bit
22850360	22854760	It's starting starting throwing bombs at me. I'm just gonna move on
22855720	22858840	I honestly think it's safer just to ignore everything
22859400	22863000	And like only shoot for like xp or something. Can I like crush them with a mech?
22863720	22865720	No, I can that's
22867400	22869960	Oh, no, is that just get me out of the mech?
22871240	22874600	No way they put this in the game because then you are come on jump
22875800	22879720	The mechs can jump. Oh my god. That's so cool
22885240	22889800	Wait, that looks like the mech can the mech's crouch. Nope. That's just reverse
22891560	22897480	They knew exactly what they were doing freaking putting that one log there. I'll have to get out
22901160	22907000	The game knew that I wanted the mech. I'm gonna get jump scared by like 10 things at once
22909480	22913480	Now I'm gonna come flying out right go away. No you're scaring me
22915240	22919080	I need the game's just freaking jump scare similar
22920040	22922040	Well, let me put that down

23704040	23705240	Huh
23705240	23706760	curious
23706760	23712600	The the viper wolves are actually attacking the navi. I thought it was an exclusive
23713560	23720360	Hey, I thought it was exclusive to us malina. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something honestly
23723640	23726120	Honestly getting much better um
23727080	23732360	It was like pretty terrifying. Oh these things whip for quite a distance
23736760	23741560	Can I make it pass without getting whipped? Okay, whew whew whew whew
23743960	23745960	Okay
23746440	23751560	I think wolves just don't like everyone in this game. Please don't knock me off the bridge. That would actually ruin my day
23751800	23753800	Oh
23754120	23756120	I don't have invisibility
23759960	23766040	I'm gonna unlock the transport location unless unless unless that
23768280	23774200	Have I made a mistake? I maybe don't need this transport location. I just thought it was important to unlock but
23776360	23779160	Are there any games with hypno effect not that I can recall
23779720	23780840	Oh
23780840	23787080	Maybe that whoa these whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa these flies are stun locking me
23789240	23793400	Sorry guys, I'm gonna leave you behind to get absolutely annihilated because I don't want to deal with that
23795800	23800440	Dude, I don't know if that card game encryption has hypno in it. I don't I don't know if I'm just making that up
23800440	23804440	I I've not played it myself. I think I've like paused for like two milliseconds
23805400	23807400	To see
23809880	23811880	Huh, wait, whoa
23812920	23816440	Skipping watching my usual streamers for stroney does a new approach
23817480	23821080	You I am an endurance streamer. So if this is not your kind of game, don't worry
23821480	23823480	Mercy is going live in t
23823960	23825080	minus
23825080	23826920	Two and a half
23826920	23832120	I have never been happier to see these these guys wherever the heck they're what are they called?
23832280	23834280	Let's see what they're called. Don't move
23834360	23839320	A UT drone, I've never been so happy to see a UT drone
23841000	23842280	Oh
23842280	23847000	Depends if you go the other route. Okay. Yeah, uh, the alternative stuff. Yeah, definitely
23848440	23855240	Not an inscription. Okay. I misremember. I'm hearing radio chatter. They don't most gone missing. The navi are pulling out
23855560	23861640	You have anything to stress playing this game. I'm pretending. Okay. I really appreciate they already went to the ocarina time
23862600	23866120	We need to hurry tensions are starting to boil over at hell's gate
23867960	23869960	I was just puked up
23871480	23877400	He's starting to invite scientists for questioning. I'm not sure what he's nervous about. We need to be careful
23878040	23881080	If the time comes we may need to make some tough choices
23883720	23884840	So
23884840	23890280	Kendra wants you to report to Monroe at hell's gate if you're gonna give me 8 000 xp for showing up sure
23890840	23894920	I'll go at hell's gate pretty sure there are lots of sections of everything in
23897880	23901240	Vampires the masquerade and destroy all humans have hypnosis
23903160	23908680	Wait vampires masquerade do you get to play as a vampire that hypnotizes people that would be kind of cool. Oh my god
23910600	23912600	I'm here for that
23912680	23917640	Oh, you okay. I feel like we level up so fast as rda. Maybe the rda isn't as long
23917640	23919640	I
23920040	23926360	Think so. Oh, that's so cool. Maybe we'll take a look at that. I've never played it or seen any gameplay of it
23926760	23927880	but
23927880	23929880	Uh, is that like a highly rated game
23932040	23935560	Dark Souls 3 has rapport for enemy control
23936920	23942680	I suppose I mean technically more door shadow and more door you can take technically like imprint
23943640	23945080	enemies
23945080	23947080	So they're not mean to you
23947880	23953800	I'm behind on my doomsday diagnosis. This is the second phone wrong with the emulator. We could have an ecological meltdown
23954600	23957800	Okay, let's hold up a sec. What the hell is this emulator?
23959080	23964040	Yes, the emulator we're searching for a dormant well of souls, right now once we find it
23964120	23969000	We need to communicate. Oh, they're pretending being called a first voice
23969800	23972440	He's the only person who can awaken a well of souls
23973080	23977640	They're pretending that the emulator isn't just a nuke
23979000	23986760	Once that's done, we can control the entire ecosystem. So back to that first ecosystem. You're running a new day diagnostic
23987640	23993000	Well, everything has its risk. Come now. Upload that home out. They're lying to me
23993320	23995160	naughty
23995160	23997160	But we're still gonna nuke the planet anyway
23997320	24000280	Once they're closer to pinpointing the location of the dormant site
24000920	24001560	You should check it
24001560	24007720	VTM does in fact have the option to be a hypnotic vanguard and highly rated as a question as a cult classic
24007800	24009800	Oh, my apology. I did not know that
24010840	24012840	I hear you took down badama
24013160	24014920	Nice work
24014920	24020040	It's good. My need to mess with it a little to make it work though. It's old game
24021160	24022920	Oh, yeah, doesn't Baldur's gate have a bunch of
24023880	24026680	Oh, I'm not playing big baldies gate yet
24028360	24030360	Don't start growing a brain
24030360	24034680	It says it's co-op. Is it like co-op that I can bring you get you guys in and out? Or is it not that kind of co-op?
24035720	24038520	The human colony and after which is pretty impressive
24040920	24045080	Baldur's gate has tons of main control efficient because main flyers are a big part of the port
24045800	24047320	Hmm
24047320	24049320	Doesn't have main control of the game
24050520	24051880	It's quite a
24051880	24055240	VTM vampires masquerade is old game
24055800	24058920	It's not that kind of coin. We're going to Graves bog
24059880	24061240	Okay

24648400	24653400	Sorry if I'm not part of the 20 players that won this game. RIP. I can't believe it. It's such a legendary game.
24654400	24657400	I can't even say I recommend, like, all go out and buy it.
24658400	24662400	The experience, for me, is more nostalgia, although this part is, like, actually...
24663400	24666400	Like, I'm actually, like, having a challenge playing this part.
24668400	24670400	I'm still in disbelief. The game even exists.
24671400	24676400	Your hands are on the controller. B-legs didn't sell the turret.
24677400	24679400	Oh, the jet didn't see the turret. Sorry, sorry.

24699400	24707400	Yeah, you leveled so far. I wonder if the RDA mission is actually, like, smaller than the main.
24708400	24712400	Wait, I want to unlock the fast travel before I take off, just in case.
24713400	24715400	Level up!

24729400	24731400	Alright, let's see how this develops.
24735400	24738400	Oh, the aim is a bit...
24739400	24741400	In front of us! Are you drunk?
24743400	24745400	Are you drunk?!
24747400	24750400	Did I just ignore the ones from behind, or...?
24751400	24754400	What's the deal? Did I just go for it?
24756400	24759400	Is this just an XP run? I think it's just an XP run.
24760400	24763400	I'll just destroy everything, have a look at that.
24765400	24767400	Oh, my gosh.
24768400	24770400	Oh, no.
24774400	24777400	Oh, that's getting... that's so loud in my head. Holy crap.
24778400	24780400	Is it too loud for stream?
24781400	24784400	That's, like, just a little deafening.
24786400	24789400	Okay, this just looks like an XP farm run. I'm gonna say it, but...
24791400	24794400	I can't even see what's ahead of me. There's so much.
24800400	24802400	Oh, excuse me. Oh, no.
24803400	24806400	Whoa! I didn't even know you were just riding those like that.
24808400	24811400	Oh. What's going on? What's going on?
24813400	24815400	Are they...?
24816400	24818400	Oh!
24820400	24825400	The camera angle is like... I'm not even driving. Who's driving this warthog?
24826400	24828400	That's a terrible job of it.
24829400	24831400	Oh, I'm overheating. Oops.
24832400	24834400	Hold on.
24835400	24839400	Overheating. I'm getting a little too overzealous with this weaponry, okay?
24843400	24844400	Oh.
24847400	24853400	This is just annihilation. I'm starting to feel bad for the Navi, like, as much as they're annoying when they're trying to kill me.
24859400	24860400	Oh.
24860400	24863400	As they hold them all clear, I can't see.
24864400	24866400	Oh, God! They're everywhere!
24873400	24875400	Oh, I don't know if I'm going to make this alive.
24877400	24880400	I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying.
24882400	24884400	It's hard.
24887400	24889400	Oh, my goodness.
24890400	24892400	Can I see?
24893400	24897400	Oh, it's a blue plant. I keep thinking it's a Navi. It's a blue plant. That's, like, right there.
24899400	24902400	Come on! Start the car!
24903400	24907400	There's only so much back and forth I can do before we actually perish. Seriously?
24909400	24912400	Oh, my goodness. Right. It seems like they're just falling back in.
24913400	24915400	Thank God. Right. Don't do that again.
24916400	24918400	Get the hell out of here!
24919400	24922400	I'm sorry I yelled at you, sweetheart, he says, to the car.
24924400	24927400	Reeflings, I'm sorry I yelled at you, sweetheart.
24928400	24932400	I just get stressed when I'm playing the bad guys and everything's all skewed.
24933400	24935400	I'm sorry if I skewed.
24939400	24940400	What?
24941400	24943400	Oh, I don't want that to break.
24946400	24948400	She's doing her best for humanity.
24950400	24952400	I'm absolutely denying it.
24953400	24955400	Denying it? Sorry. Destroying it.
24958400	24960400	If I'm getting XP,
24965400	24967400	the first things are running away.
24967400	24968400	Right.
24972400	24975400	That's my car. That's one of more guys.
24976400	24977400	I didn't even know.
24979400	24981400	Oh, first things.
24982400	24987400	I just feel bad. I feel like we're entering a zoo and then just executing all the animals inside the zoo.
24989400	24991400	This is what this run feels like, honestly.
24993400	24995400	Like, they're literally running away now.
24998400	24999400	Yeah.
25000400	25003400	All for XP, so I can unlock a new armor. Why not?
25009400	25011400	Perish that plan.
25012400	25014400	In front, are you do- Oh!
25017400	25018400	Is that supposed to happen?
25022400	25025400	What a unique game mode to say the least.
25025400	25029400	I think you see about three of these guys if you play Navi,
25029400	25033400	and you see 100 on this one section of the game alone.
25039400	25041400	We're strum-beast-pulling.
25042400	25046400	That's where it's been. Oh my god. That was...
25047400	25051400	That was a slaughter. I'm not even happy with that. That was awful.
25055400	25056400	I'm bad.
25068400	25072400	This is why the Navi section has so few human campaign colors.
25072400	25074400	Now you know why you don't see them in this.
25075400	25076400	Oh!
25077400	25083400	Is it like all this damage is being done and we're just coming at the back end of it?
25085400	25088400	Aw, that actually makes so much sense.
25091400	25097400	We basically come in when they're at the end of the losing fight and we turn the tide.
25099400	25100400	Okay.
25101400	25103400	Oh my god, that's so smart.
25104400	25109400	I didn't give the devs team as much benefit as they do, but that's so smart.
25110400	25114400	Don't let him... I was gonna say don't let him kill you,
25114400	25117400	because he's gonna aggro to me and I can just tell he is.
25118400	25120400	Oh wait, hold on. I'm trying to go.
25120400	25122400	Hold on a minute. Let me...
25123400	25124400	There we go.
25125400	25127400	I'll just let him get in the back end.
25127400	25129400	What new drift have we got?
25129400	25133400	Wait, I think we're about to unlock the new one, because now our arms are on short
25133400	25135400	and I'm like, that's the opposite of what I want.
25135400	25137400	It does. I hate her.
25138400	25141400	Oh, no clue if it's kind of, it's just a joke of mine.
25141400	25144400	I mean it may be, because literally you only see two of them.
25145400	25147400	Alright, where do I need to go?
25147400	25150400	Well, I'm taking a car for that.
25150400	25151400	I'm not taking that by foot.
25151400	25153400	Can I drive this?
25155400	25157400	Kendra?
25158400	25161400	How do I shoot? I don't know. Can I drive him over?
25161400	25162400	Oh, that was...
25162400	25165400	I was actually really mean. I shouldn't have gone that far.
25165400	25167400	I kind of deserved it.
25167400	25170400	What are all those things? Are those reports?
25174400	25177400	So can I not shoot? I don't think I can.
25177400	25179400	I think I can only drive.
25179400	25181400	I'm driving this buggy.
25181400	25183400	That's like such a long way to go.
25184400	25188400	I'll go on the outskirts to get the...
25190400	25193400	like uncovered map thing.
25193400	25195400	I actually smished him against the wall.
25198400	25200400	I can't go that way.
25201400	25205400	This is so much more responsive than the buggy I have to admit.
25205400	25208400	I like that they make that differentiation.
25212400	25213400	Okay.
25213400	25215400	We can go this way.
25215400	25219400	I thought we couldn't consider the way the map made it look, but we...
25219400	25221400	No, I did not just do that.
25221400	25223400	Oh, I did not just do that.
25224400	25226400	I freaking did!
25227400	25229400	No, no, no.
25230400	25231400	Hello, game.
25231400	25233400	Oh my gosh.
25235400	25240400	Oh, this is the worst thing that could have happened has not happened.
25241400	25244400	Door stock, literally door stock.
25244400	25246400	And I have to do all of this on foot,
25246400	25249400	whilst everything is aggressive to me.
25250400	25252400	Right, how much further do I have to go?
25252400	25253400	Just leave it for it.
25253400	25254400	Just down the street.
25254400	25255400	It's fine.
25255400	25257400	I just need to pop down the street.
25257400	25258400	It's like going to the corner shop.
25258400	25260400	It's just around the corner.
25260400	25262400	It's okay.
25262400	25264400	You can just teleport down.
25264400	25266400	I can't because I've not unlocked whatever it is.
25266400	25268400	It's not unlocked.
25270400	25271400	Is it quiet?
25271400	25273400	Is it safe question mark?
25273400	25276400	Other than the fly trap?
25277400	25278400	Just a little bit more.
25278400	25280400	All is good.
25280400	25282400	This is called Sniper's Point
25282400	25284400	implying that there's Sniper Navi
25284400	25286400	looking at me right now, question mark.
25287400	25289400	The ho-hum.
25289400	25290400	Okay.
25290400	25291400	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
25291400	25292400	Something's getting me.
25292400	25293400	I don't want.
25293400	25294400	A fly?
25294400	25295400	A fly got me.
25295400	25296400	A mosquito.
25296400	25297400	A mosquito got me.
25297400	25298400	Oh!
25298400	25299400	Whoa.
25299400	25300400	Look at it.
25300400	25302400	Freaking ready to like get me already.
25303400	25305400	I'll wait until my invis comes back.
25305400	25306400	Yeah.
25306400	25307400	Yeah, that's right.
25307400	25308400	Go back to sleep.
25308400	25309400	Yep.
25309400	25310400	Stinky.
25310400	25311400	Stinky plant.
25311400	25312400	I don't like you.
25312400	25314400	Abandoned RDA camp.
25314400	25315400	Well, that doesn't...
25315400	25316400	That doesn't...
25316400	25317400	This is just...
25318400	25319400	This is not good for me.
25319400	25320400	I can tell you that much.
25320400	25322400	This is absolutely awful for me.
25322400	25325400	I will take the teleport point
25325400	25327400	just so I don't have to do that again.
25327400	25328400	Um...
25330400	25331400	Um...
25332400	25333400	Can I hide here?
25334400	25336400	Well, he looks pretty enraged to me.
25337400	25338400	Um...
25340400	25341400	I have nowhere.
25341400	25342400	I'm gonna go up.
25342400	25343400	Oh no, I can't go up.
25343400	25344400	I'm too small.
25346400	25347400	Where...
25347400	25349400	Where's the crystal, guys?
25349400	25350400	I don't really want to go.
25350400	25351400	Abandoned hope.
25351400	25354400	Yo, ye who may enter from the floor.
25354400	25355400	Finger.
25355400	25356400	But hole.
25356400	25357400	Oh.
25358400	25360400	There's this to spray them down.
25362400	25363400	Hmm.
25364400	25365400	Okay.
25371400	25373400	Did they just run away from me now?
25377400	25378400	Okay.
25379400	25382400	Okay, not too bad if I have a tulile.
25382400	25384400	I really destroy all this stuff too.
25384400	25385400	I mean, it's 10 XP.
25385400	25388400	I'm not really sure it's worth taking the time to do that.
25389400	25391400	I will try and clear up this area
25391400	25394400	because if I'm trying to find a crystal in the middle,
25394400	25395400	I'm still free jumping.
25395400	25397400	I don't even know where I'm supposed to look.
25400400	25402400	Oh, now you come around the corner.
25402400	25404400	Nah, you're such a liar.
25404400	25405400	You're actually such a liar.
25405400	25406400	You're telling fivers.
25406400	25408400	Why would you come around the corner now
25408400	25410400	after I'd already sprayed you?
25411400	25413400	Where on earth is this...
25413400	25414400	thing?
25416400	25418400	And he's already AI locked onto me.
25418400	25420400	I don't know why the game pretend to be otherwise.
25421400	25423400	Is there another turret over here that I can use?
25424400	25426400	I know the things back in that other section.
25426400	25427400	I'm just wondering what's up here.
25427400	25429400	Why is there a dead end?
25430400	25433400	Oh, and it's just like one of these things.
25433400	25434400	Jeez.
25435400	25436400	That gorilla.
25439400	25440400	It's just abandoned.
25440400	25442400	Kind of showing you it's old.
25443400	25444400	Abandoned...
25445400	25446400	Dog.
25446400	25447400	Pet dog.
25448400	25449400	It's a turtle.
25450400	25454400	I have no idea what's hecking crystal on Zoom right now.
25456400	25459400	It's already aggroed to me but I can't see.
25460400	25463400	Maybe inside that building and that's why it's like flashing?
25463400	25464400	Okay.
25471400	25472400	Oh, pardon me.
25475400	25478400	I'm gonna go invisible and see if I can shoot it from that turret
25478400	25480400	or is it already glued onto me?
25480400	25481400	No.
25485400	25486400	Is it in here?
25489400	25492400	Bro, where is this freaking cell sample?
25492400	25493400	I don't know.
25494400	25497400	I'm gonna see if I can get rid of that last guy with this
25497400	25498400	because he...
25498400	25500400	I just saw a second one.
25501400	25503400	Wait, let's get rid of you
25503400	25504400	because you're in Moe.
25504400	25505400	You're in Moe.
25505400	25506400	You're in Moe.
25506400	25507400	You're in Moe.
25511400	25512400	Right.
25512400	25513400	No.
25513400	25516400	I think wherever the heck it is, it's somewhere over here.
25516400	25517400	It's not been here yet.
25519400	25520400	Right.
25523400	25524400	I hate you.
25525400	25527400	What, even if you're invisible?
25527400	25529400	Oh, he's got protection prior on.
25529400	25530400	I can see it.
25530400	25531400	That's what that bloom means.
25532400	25533400	Boy.
25534400	25535400	Here.
25535400	25536400	Oh, I just...
25538400	25539400	What did I get?
25539400	25541400	I got new armor and speed four.
25541400	25542400	I'll take that.
25544400	25547400	Bro, am I actually gonna have to look up a tutorial?
25552400	25553400	That was big.
25554400	25555400	I've got a different outfit.
25555400	25556400	I'm like...
25559400	25560400	It's not that way.
25560400	25563400	It's out of bounds over there, basically.
25565400	25567400	It's not like up here.
25568400	25569400	Whoa, sorry.
25569400	25570400	Sorry.
25570400	25571400	I wasn't paying attention.
25571400	25572400	Is it up?
25572400	25573400	Should it be up?
25574400	25577400	Where the heck is this one thing?
25577400	25578400	Hmm.
25580400	25582400	No, don't spray on me.
25583400	25585400	Now's not time for that.
25588400	25589400	Hello.
25590400	25594400	We're currently looking for something that my blind eyes cannot perceive.
25597400	25602400	It says it's somewhere in this area and I keep perfectly avoiding it, whatever it is.
25604400	25605400	Okay.
25605400	25608400	Now the avatars are coming in this area?
25608400	25609400	Is it inside that, maybe?
25609400	25611400	Maybe it's inside this one, whatever it is.
25613400	25614400	It's in the building.
25614400	25615400	Oh.
25616400	25619400	If it's in this one, I'm gonna be mad because I went in the other one.
25619400	25622400	Oh, for goodness' sake, thank you.
25622400	25624400	What are the odds?
25625400	25627400	Right, finally got there in the end.
25628400	25631400	And of course there's not fast travel with that guy because that would be too easy, wouldn't it?
25635400	25636400	Ugh.
25637400	25640400	That speed is fast though, like I'm pretty speedy.
25641400	25644400	Of course it was in the building that I wasn't looking at.
25645400	25647400	How could I be such a silly sausage?
25647400	25649400	I was beating up my car.
25650400	25652400	Yeah, I had to put a down payment on that.
25653400	25655400	Right, this is gonna be off topic.
25656400	25658400	I don't know if you guys have been watching.
25659400	25663400	There's this YouTuber that looks at people's finances, like for entertainment.
25663400	25666400	But he always shouts at them for having a car.
25666400	25671400	And I didn't realize that car loans were like really predatory in America.
25672400	25676400	Where they like make you pay like a ridiculous like percentage and stuff.
25676400	25678400	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
25678400	25680400	You just relax, little flies, you just relax.
25681400	25682400	Thank you.
25682400	25683400	Thank you.
25685400	25686400	And me two more?
25686400	25689400	No, one more crystal and then I'm good to go.
25690400	25691400	You two, huh?
25691400	25694400	One, and it took four tenths, bad day for bets.
25694400	25695400	It seems no.
25696400	25698400	Don't be getting, don't be betting on me honestly.
25699400	25702400	I want you to collect the shard from a nearby Navi village.
25702400	25705400	Okay, let's give it a shot.
25706400	25711400	I believe this is the second last shard collection map.
25711400	25714400	And then we've done the campaign unbelievably.
25715400	25720400	We are just going for it.
25721400	25723400	I love being ignored in battle.
25723400	25724400	Yay.
25724400	25727400	I love going so fast that the enemies don't target me.
25727400	25728400	Yay.
25731400	25733400	I love not being a part of the fight.
25733400	25735400	Ow, he just spanked my butt.
25738400	25739400	Good night.
25739400	25741400	Rest well, those who need to sleep.
25741400	25744400	Sorry about kind of the surprise endurance stream.
25744400	25746400	I thought it was only going to be four hours.
25746400	25747400	What were we at?
25749400	25751400	We're at seven hours?
25751400	25752400	Oh my gosh.
25752400	25753400	Sorry.
25754400	25755400	Sorry to anyone.
25755400	25757400	Good night and rest well, those who need to go.
25757400	25759400	Please do not stay up against your health.
25759400	25760400	Just watch.
25760400	25763400	The vaude will be remaining for you soon, TM.
25772400	25775400	You must kill Tanjala before you collect the harmonic and the willow tree.
25775400	25777400	Right, we've got a boss fight.
25777400	25778400	But we can do it.
25778400	25779400	We can do it.
25779400	25781400	We can do it if we put our mind to.
25781400	25783400	We can do...
25783400	25784400	Where am I?
25784400	25785400	I'm not trying to go.
25785400	25787400	I'm behind a tent right now.
25787400	25790400	Living up to the endurance streamer tag anyway.
25790400	25791400	Yeah.
25792400	25799400	I wonder how many people didn't realize when I said endurance streamer
25799400	25803400	I meant endurance streamer.
25803400	25804400	Okay.
25805400	25806400	Right, where am I doing?
25806400	25807400	Just kind of...
25807400	25808400	Kind of half...
25808400	25809400	Hold the map.
25809400	25810400	Oh!
25810400	25813400	Oh, I'm in the battlefield by accident.
25817400	25819400	Stromer, look at this child.
25822400	25824400	Tanjala near me.
25824400	25825400	What a surprise.
25826400	25829400	Look at my speed.
25829400	25831400	My speed is amazing.
25831400	25833400	I'm a super soldier.
25834400	25836400	It tastes like raisins.
25838400	25841400	I was surprised but I haven't missed them at how.
25841400	25842400	Oh my God.
25845400	25847400	I have streamed a heck of a lot of time.
25847400	25849400	I feel like maybe.
25855400	25856400	Watch yourself.
25860400	25862400	I can't even see the enemy.
25862400	25863400	You know that?
25863400	25864400	I actually can't.
25864400	25865400	I'm not being funny.
25865400	25870400	I didn't mean to good battle but I genuinely can't see the enemy.
25870400	25872400	What do you want me to do?
25872400	25873400	Oh, no way.
25873400	25876400	I've just engaged the boss fight.
25876400	25877400	Stop.
25877400	25878400	Stop.
25878400	25881400	I've engaged the boss fight and there's literally a billion...
25881400	25884400	I didn't even see you.
25884400	25887400	You're going to make me pee myself, please.
25887400	25888400	Oh my God.
25888400	25889400	I think I need flamethrower to like...
25889400	25890400	Oh my God.
25890400	25892400	I'm just getting absolutely gang violence here.
25892400	25894400	What am I supposed to do?
25894400	25896400	I need pop malts.
25896400	25897400	I need pop malts.
25897400	25899400	I need pop malts like right now.
25899400	25903400	They're all using freaking prayer protection.
25903400	25904400	I'm out of mana.
25904400	25905400	I'm out of mana.
25905400	25909400	I actually can't do prayer protection because I'm out of mana.
25909400	25915400	I'm running out of freaking strength potion as if we were playing rescapes right now.
25915400	25917400	Oh my gosh.
25917400	25918400	What have I done?
25918400	25920400	What have I done?
25920400	25921400	What have I done?
25921400	25923400	I've just dived into the enemy.
25923400	25927400	I literally can't see them for half the time.
25927400	25932400	Oh and there's someone sniping me from behind as well.
25932400	25934400	No, sorry, but no.
25934400	25935400	It's just no on.
25935400	25941400	You can't even just snake me from halfway across the map.
25941400	25943400	Why did that one run away?
25943400	25944400	I have no idea.
25944400	25947400	I'm guessing that ranged or whatever.
25947400	25952400	The sniper one is still wound for me, but at least that other one ran away.
25952400	25955400	Okay, that's the problem I have with the snipers.
25955400	25956400	They can do that.
25956400	25957400	Yes.
25957400	25959400	Thank you for coming freaking point blank.
25959400	25960400	Why?
25960400	25961400	Oh wow.
25961400	25964400	Tangela pushed me so far out of his battle area.
25964400	25966400	He has literally...
25966400	25967400	DC?
25967400	25968400	No.
25968400	25971400	I can see that other NPC though.
25971400	25973400	Can I shoot him once?
25973400	25975400	Oh, that's the flamethrower darling.
25975400	25977400	That's the shotgun.
25977400	25978400	Can I?
25978400	25979400	I just want him.
25979400	25982400	There we go.
25982400	25983400	Okay.
25983400	25984400	There we go.
25984400	25986400	I just wanted him to attack me.
25986400	25989400	No one else.
25989400	25993400	Okay, let's take it nice and easy.
25993400	25996400	She says that she gets caught in the tree.
25996400	25997400	No, that...
25997400	25998400	No.
25998400	25999400	Shotgun.
25999400	26000400	Shotgun.
26000400	26001400	No, no, no, no, no, no.
26001400	26002400	I missed.
26002400	26004400	Okay, this is what I want.
26004400	26009400	The shotgun stagger is exactly what I'm looking for right now.
26009400	26010400	It can be...
26010400	26012400	What's the name of a shotgun?
26012400	26014400	It can be a spad.
26014400	26016400	12 is the name of a shotgun.
26016400	26019400	A stakeout is the name of a shotgun.
26019400	26021400	Another gun.
26021400	26025400	I don't remember any other ones off the top of my head.
26025400	26030400	Not very good with gun names unless they're in Black Ops 1 and all, honestly.
26030400	26033400	Famous, AK-47.
26033400	26035400	Sub-machine guns.
26035400	26037400	Susies.
26037400	26040400	AK-47U.
26040400	26041400	MP5.
26041400	26044400	Very classic, normally shown in movies.
26044400	26045400	MP5K.
26045400	26046400	Brian!
26046400	26048400	I have returned from the job strongy.
26048400	26050400	Hope it's going well.
26050400	26055400	We're currently doing a boss battle and I'm getting absolutely wrecked, tiny, spiny.
26055400	26058400	But...
26058400	26061400	I can only do as much as I can.
26061400	26062400	It's taken a while.
26062400	26063400	I don't know.
26063400	26066400	I feel like maybe there's something I should know.
26066400	26069400	Like, maybe I should be in a mech at this point.
26069400	26071400	It's very plausible.
26071400	26073400	But thank you for the ship.
26073400	26076400	We're getting there.
26076400	26078400	He's just cast protection, so I don't even wanna...
26078400	26082400	Like, I don't wanna waste the ammo since I've only got two left.
26082400	26086400	Like, stop with the prayer protection.
26086400	26087400	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
26087400	26088400	Okay, I'm out of that.
26088400	26090400	So next is Flamethrower.
26090400	26093400	Nah, he gets so close when I do Flamethrower.
26093400	26095400	Like, so close.
26095400	26099400	Has he got Fury on so he does double damage to me?
26099400	26101400	I think so.
26101400	26103400	I think that's what that was.
26103400	26105400	Right, we're just gonna have to do this.
26105400	26108400	It seems he staggers with the assault, right?
26112400	26115400	I think he's got a light machine gun, actually.
26119400	26122400	He's getting low, so if he doesn't heal,
26122400	26124400	then I think we're in...
26124400	26127400	I think we're cooking by gas if he doesn't heal.
26127400	26131400	Oh, okay, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it.
26132400	26137400	I cast Mystic Barrier, honestly.
26137400	26141400	Getting wrecked isn't needing to use ult and hasn't poked the damage,
26141400	26144400	but someone either, honestly.
26144400	26149400	First try, like, I'm just glad I'm not dying and getting stun locked.
26149400	26152400	Where or why am I here?
26154400	26157400	Why?
26157400	26160400	What am I to do?
26160400	26163400	Oh wait, I'm to do the song.
26163400	26166400	I'm to do the song, I understand, my apologies.
26166400	26168400	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
26168400	26171400	You need to relax
26171400	26174400	and take your little acrobatic self away.
26174400	26176400	I need to do the song right now, where is it?
26176400	26180400	Right, one, and then do a triangle.
26180400	26182400	Somewhere here?
26182400	26183400	No?
26183400	26184400	Somewhere over here?
26184400	26186400	Somewhere in the water?
26187400	26190400	Okay, okay, triangle, triangle.
26196400	26198400	Triangle?
26202400	26203400	Oh, you don't attack.
26203400	26207400	Whoa, they are humongous if you're a baby.
26208400	26209400	Wait, where?
26209400	26211400	Triangle?
26212400	26215400	Well, that would be a triangle, maybe here.
26215400	26217400	Okay, okay.
26217400	26219400	Not a perfect triangle.
26219400	26221400	We're about there cages.
26221400	26223400	Staggered to death, honestly.
26223400	26225400	Humongous wall.
26225400	26227400	Strongly doesn't.
26227400	26230400	For democracy, wait, wrong thing.
26230400	26233400	What did you guys think of Helldivers?
26233400	26238400	I got a chance to play it and I was like,
26238400	26241400	hmm, I wonder if one of those things,
26241400	26243400	like if you have good company and then it's a fun game,
26243400	26247400	but who goes there, identify yourself?
26247400	26250400	Whoa, get me out of here, because I just heard that.
26250400	26253400	We're just doing this.
26253400	26256400	I only played one, need friends for it.
26256400	26258400	It was good until Sony.
26258400	26260400	Oh, yeah, wait, actually, holy crap,
26260400	26264400	we like completely missed out on all the war hammer.
26264400	26268400	Okay, all the friggin...
26271400	26274400	All right, well, and then all the kills in.
26274400	26276400	Can I die in a cutscene?
26276400	26277400	You did it.
26277400	26279400	You did it.
26279400	26282400	Oh, right, last song, question mark.
26284400	26287400	I would like to return to Hell's Gate, please.
26287400	26289400	Thank you very much.
26289400	26292400	Oh, sorry, my little feces are moving my feet.
26292400	26295400	My hands are very sweaty, but my feet are very dry right now,
26295400	26298400	and I don't know if that means I'm dehydrated.
26302400	26304400	I won't have a mention of your pop-up.
26304400	26305400	Sorry, I misnamed it.
26305400	26310400	I meant Helldivers, Sam.
26310400	26315400	The Helldivers, like, it was like people were...
26315400	26318400	They tried to make it so you had to have a PSN account or something,
26318400	26320400	just to play the game.
26320400	26323400	Even though they advertised, like,
26323400	26327400	you can still play your game even without the PSN part.
26328400	26331400	When in doubt, drink.
26334400	26336400	Okay, is this...?
26338400	26341400	Okay, this is the third song.
26347400	26349400	Monkos.
26351400	26352400	Oh!
26355400	26356400	Jesus.
26356400	26358400	That's so, um...
26358400	26360400	He's so stinky.
26360400	26362400	Level up.
26363400	26365400	Yeah, they tried to force PSN accounts to play,
26365400	26368400	which would have locked a lot of people out.
26368400	26371400	And they're known for getting, uh, leaks, you know.
26371400	26372400	Yeah.
26377400	26379400	Deep Rock Galactic.
26379400	26381400	They made a Lord of the Rings version.
26381400	26383400	I think they called it Mines of Moria.
26383400	26386400	I've not played it, but I hope it's multiplayer
26386400	26388400	and I can, like, play with you guys.
26388400	26390400	It'd be so fun.
26401400	26403400	Speaking of which, you should check with him
26403400	26405400	for your next mission.
26405400	26407400	Oh, no.
26407400	26409400	Oh, no.
26413400	26414400	Huh?
26416400	26418400	Oh, I'm having an avatar fight with him.
26422400	26424400	Jarhead.
26426400	26429400	I'll prove to you that I'm a real trooper.
26429400	26432400	I'll eat crayons and smile about it.
26434400	26436400	Deep Rock is crazy fun.
26436400	26438400	We're it!
26438400	26441400	We are going to the Hanging Gardens.
26443400	26445400	This guy's very ergo.
26445400	26447400	Part of the Jarhead clan.
26447400	26449400	Oh, that's right! In the movies!
26449400	26451400	These are part of the Jarhead clan.
26452400	26454400	Movie quote spotted.
26459400	26460400	Mushroom.
26461400	26463400	Rock and Stone.
26465400	26466400	Hello!
26470400	26471400	We already...
26471400	26472400	Let's hit the envelope.
26472400	26474400	I've never heard that before.
26474400	26476400	Let's hit the envelope.
26476400	26478400	The Hanging Gardens.
26482400	26484400	Did I hear Rock and Stone?
26484400	26485400	You did.
26486400	26488400	Do you think I can convince the girls
26488400	26490400	to remain Zamorio with me?
26495400	26497400	Triple Cannibal?
26509400	26511400	Oh, dear.
26513400	26515400	Uh, hello?
26519400	26521400	We've just landed?
26525400	26526400	Can I reload?
26527400	26528400	I'm already out of money.
26528400	26529400	Eh, money.
26529400	26530400	I'm munitions.
26531400	26532400	Did I not...
26532400	26534400	Did the game automatically reload it for me?
26537400	26540400	I want rid of these bow and arrow guys first.
26543400	26545400	I only have three revives.
26545400	26546400	I need to keep pick it.
26546400	26547400	Wow!
26547400	26552400	This is why I want rid of these bow and arrows.
26557400	26558400	Oh, goodness me.
26558400	26560400	Can I get a breathing space?
26562400	26564400	Oh, this is crazy.
26565400	26566400	Give me some space.
26566400	26568400	Give me some space, please.
26571400	26573400	Oh, space, space, space.
26574400	26576400	They just keep coming.
26577400	26579400	Oh, I'm getting spanked about.
26579400	26580400	Oh, wrong button.
26580400	26582400	Actually, no, protection's fine.
26586400	26588400	They keep going around.
26592400	26595400	Stop with the bow and arrow.
26597400	26600400	Oh, this is so unpredictable where they move.
26603400	26605400	Alright, I need to kill one more,
26605400	26607400	and then I think they stop respawning.
26607400	26608400	So this is...
26609400	26612400	I'm just getting stun logged.
26612400	26613400	I wish I had that.
26613400	26616400	Is that what my belly did when I was a Navi?
26617400	26618400	Oh, my gosh.
26619400	26620400	What a rough landing.
26620400	26621400	Oh, yeah.
26621400	26622400	What does it say?
26622400	26624400	Oh, it's a Haiti landing.
26624400	26625400	Why?
26625400	26626400	Why is it Haiti?
26626400	26627400	Why Haiti?
26627400	26628400	It's not Haiti.
26630400	26632400	It was a miss input, miss input.
26633400	26634400	That was chaos.
26634400	26636400	That just dropped me right in there.
26646400	26647400	Batista.
26650400	26651400	Destroyed the Navi.
26653400	26655400	Haiti, as opposed to smooth.
26655400	26656400	Oh!
26657400	26659400	Now that you have said that out loud,
26659400	26662400	that makes so much more sense.
26663400	26666400	I always wondered why the heck they always mentioned that.
26666400	26667400	Oh, that was Harry.
26667400	26668400	That was Harry.
26668400	26669400	Harry.
26669400	26670400	Harry.
26670400	26672400	And I'm like, and I'm missing something.
26672400	26674400	Clearly, brain cells, the whole thing.
26674400	26676400	Alright, how do I get to this location?
26678400	26681400	Take the skinny path behind me.
26681400	26683400	I need to do a big old 1A.
26685400	26688400	Why is the camera angle so bad in this game?
26690400	26691400	Wait.
26691400	26692400	Oh, no.
26692400	26694400	Yeah, we're not doing that in the buggy.
26694400	26696400	Please let me out.
26697400	26699400	We will do this by foot.
26701400	26703400	Is this where the flamethrower comes in?
26703400	26705400	Can I even get close enough?
26705400	26706400	Oh, I can.
26711400	26712400	Okay.
26712400	26715400	Flamethrower for the wildlife.
26715400	26716400	For the plants.
26718400	26719400	That's fine by me.
26719400	26721400	I will try to remember this.
26723400	26725400	If I make it across here,
26725400	26727400	the dogs will go everywhere until...
26727400	26728400	Get right.
26728400	26730400	Wait, am I going the right way?
26730400	26732400	Yeah, just keep going and then go to the right.
26732400	26733400	Okay.
26735400	26736400	Brilliant driving.
26736400	26737400	Look, I'm...
26737400	26740400	Thank goodness I don't actually have a driver's license
26740400	26742400	because I'm not going to lie.
26742400	26745400	It would not go down well.
26745400	26746400	I can hear trombone.
26748400	26750400	You're so rich.
26753400	26755400	Oh, there's quite a lot of you.
26755400	26758400	As long as I can jump past you, it's fine.
26758400	26759400	I'll let you live.
26759400	26761400	You know, I'm doing...
26761400	26762400	I'm doing a while.
26762400	26765400	We favor not killing you all, actually.
26765400	26766400	So you should be...
26766400	26767400	You should be grateful.
26767400	26769400	You should be thankful.
26769400	26772400	I said you should be grateful
26772400	26775400	and you should be thankful.
26775400	26777400	What the heck is this?
26777400	26778400	I don't know.
26779400	26780400	A repulsor?
26782400	26783400	A zone repulse.
26783400	26785400	Oh, that's right.
26785400	26786400	Please.
26786400	26787400	No, no.
26787400	26788400	Please just let me do it so you guys leave.
26788400	26789400	Oh, okay.
26789400	26790400	They're safe.
26790400	26792400	Nah, I've seen worse drivers.
26792400	26793400	I can't believe it.
26793400	26796400	I can't believe I contributed to the stereotype.
26796400	26799400	Wait, is this grunt here to help us or...
26803400	26806400	No, he's here to give us our next job.
26809400	26810400	Booyah.
26812400	26814400	Don't worry, we're almost there.
26822400	26823400	DT.
26829400	26830400	DT.
26830400	26831400	Sure.
26831400	26832400	DT.
26834400	26836400	Oh, that makes broken.
26836400	26837400	I was gonna go in there.
26839400	26841400	If I go straight ahead,
26841400	26842400	should be fine.
26842400	26843400	Let's go.
26843400	26844400	Why not?
26845400	26847400	Wait, straight ahead.
26847400	26848400	Yeah, straight ahead.
26850400	26852400	Okay, let's...
26852400	26854400	Don't flip the buggy.
26854400	26856400	It's my only request.
26857400	26858400	It's killing...
26864400	26866400	Why would you do that?
26866400	26868400	You knew exactly what you were doing?
26871400	26872400	I can't get up.
26874400	26877400	I can't get up and everything's gonna attack me.
26877400	26878400	Literally, look on the map.
26878400	26881400	There's like a freaking massive ass battle bone.
26881400	26882400	It's over.
26882400	26884400	This is over for me.
26885400	26886400	Yeah.
26886400	26888400	Oh my gosh.
26888400	26891400	Oh my gosh.
26891400	26893400	Oh my gosh, Golly.
26894400	26896400	Oh gosh, Golly G.
26897400	26900400	That really was not supposed to happen.
26900400	26903400	The Dave, who have created this map,
26903400	26905400	knew exactly what he was doing.
26905400	26907400	Giving me a heart attack.
26908400	26910400	They're still here.
26910400	26913400	They're literally waiting to attack me.
26915400	26917400	I'm trying, I'm trying.
26923400	26925400	It's getting a bit non-smooth.
26925400	26926400	It's getting a bit heady, lads.
26926400	26927400	It's getting a bit heady.
26927400	26929400	Okay, we're friends, it's fine.
26929400	26931400	Friends.
26937400	26940400	Actually, there's no way you're a super stash.
26940400	26943400	You'll play the game by just dodging everything all the time.
26943400	26946400	But this is the best I can do under the turquoise.
26948400	26950400	Can I get this package, please?
26950400	26951400	Thank you.
26952400	26953400	Objective complete.
26953400	26955400	Let's get the heck out of here.
26955400	26956400	Jeez.
26957400	26958400	Where'd I need?
26959400	26963400	Brett, can you stop sending me one side of the map to the other?
26963400	26964400	I don't...
26965400	26968400	This game is having an awfully fun time doing that.
26968400	26969400	How...
26969400	26970400	I can't even teleport there.
26970400	26973400	There's not even anything to teleport from.
26975400	26979400	If I take a right and don't fall off, man...
26980400	26981400	You fell off.
26982400	26984400	Oh, let's go, let's go, let's go.
26985400	26991400	Just ignore me, I'm not part of the field.
26991400	26992400	I'm actually...
26992400	26994400	Oh, I'm just a field medic.
26995400	26996400	What is it?
26996400	26999400	That British Red Cross rule or something?
27000400	27002400	I can't get over.
27002400	27004400	I have to go to a low.
27005400	27007400	I don't want to take any fall damage.
27007400	27010400	I'm literally two centimeters off the ground, so...
27011400	27013400	Oh, we have to take the long way around.
27014400	27016400	Through all those navi!
27016400	27018400	And they're literally right there.
27018400	27020400	And they're already attacking me.
27021400	27023400	Oh, the navi.
27023400	27024400	And attacking me.
27024400	27026400	Name a better duo.
27026400	27028400	Do I go that way?
27029400	27031400	Yes, I can go that way.
27032400	27036400	I literally went invisible as that guy struck me.
27037400	27040400	No white crosses for health packs and games and stuff.
27040400	27042400	Apparently that's a war crime.
27042400	27044400	Also, shooting unarmed medics.
27044400	27047400	Exactly, like seriously, what's going on here?
27048400	27049400	You cannae jump it?
27049400	27051400	No, I cannae jump it.
27051400	27053400	Right, I'm sure these are bombs.
27053400	27056400	Yeah, okay, I was gonna say, I'm sure there's something up with those.
27056400	27059400	I had to find out for myself, I'd find out the hard way.
27062400	27064400	Oh, there's so many of them.
27067400	27070400	Okay, you don't even respond to that.
27072400	27076400	Oh, let me guess, they don't hurt the level, so it's gonna be too easy.
27078400	27079400	Oh!
27079400	27080400	Oh, no, no, no.
27080400	27081400	There's no human here.
27081400	27082400	I'm actually a...
27082400	27084400	I'm a mouse.
27084400	27085400	I'm a mammal.
27085400	27088400	No, wait, navi aren't considered mammals, are they?
27088400	27089400	I'm actually a...
27089400	27091400	I feel like I'm going the wrong way.
27091400	27093400	I feel like I'm going the wrong way.
27094400	27097400	Technically, if I just keep going forward, it's fine.
27097400	27100400	I just jive right into them.
27100400	27101400	I'm not real.
27101400	27104400	I'm actually gonna claim this pod first, and then go in with...
27104400	27107400	I'm probably gonna get shot in the bum with an arrow though.
27107400	27108400	Oh.
27108400	27110400	Oh, and there's another one right there.
27110400	27112400	Har har har, very funny game.
27113400	27114400	No human here, only a co-
27114400	27119400	Literally, I'm just an innocent little sef full of pod doing my thing, you know?
27119400	27120400	Hey, no good time.
27121400	27124400	Just need to try and speedrun getting out of all these
27124400	27127400	absolutely atrociously dangerous areas,
27127400	27130400	and then we can finally destroy Pandora,
27130400	27133400	and live happily ever after.
27134400	27135400	Wait.
27135400	27136400	Oh.
27136400	27137400	Wait.
27140400	27142400	Oh, no, you do that much better.
27143400	27145400	Wait, this is a dead end?
27146400	27147400	Can you stop?
27147400	27150400	Please, I'm literally stuck here with you.
27150400	27151400	Is this a dead end?
27151400	27152400	Yes or no?
27153400	27156400	Have I just gone a horrifically wrong way?
27158400	27160400	Why would you do that?
27160400	27165400	Okay, I need to now take the biggest frickin' circle over.
27168400	27170400	Hi everyone, I'm back.
27170400	27172400	Thank you for joining again.
27172400	27174400	We are still the RD, we're still the bad guys,
27174400	27178400	and we're still avoiding every fight possible under the sun
27178400	27182400	because this is just impossible, there's no way.
27183400	27186400	I refuse to believe this is even plausible.
27187400	27189400	Humans number one, baby.
27189400	27190400	Innocent.
27190400	27192400	Innocent, no.
27193400	27194400	Innocent.
27194400	27196400	I'm an innocent cuttlefish.
27196400	27199400	Hold on a minute, I don't know if you've seen them or anything.
27199400	27201400	I'm an innocent cuttlefish.
27202400	27203400	Oh, that scared me.
27204400	27206400	I actually need to heal.
27206400	27211400	I need to heal, but I want to stop because I think I'm going to get my bum bitten.
27214400	27221400	Oh my god, the paralysis from those flies are so punishing.
27222400	27223400	So punishing.
27223400	27226400	I'm going to see if I can run past both of these, but...
27227400	27231400	Oh, poison, poison, poison.
27232400	27233400	Hello?
27235400	27237400	Am I walled off again?
27238400	27240400	What have I done to me?
27240400	27241400	Why?
27243400	27245400	What have I done to deserve this?
27246400	27247400	Why?
27247400	27250400	I'm so confused why I can't access this area.
27250400	27252400	I literally need to go down.
27257400	27260400	Okay, that dog can't come on me.
27262400	27263400	On the branch.
27263400	27265400	Oh, can I climb down this?
27265400	27266400	Or is this Navi only?
27266400	27267400	No, it can't be Navi only.
27267400	27268400	I'm human.
27268400	27270400	I can't freaking do it.
27272400	27278400	Bro, I'm going to explore the whole map before I actually get to my location.
27280400	27281400	I can't believe...
27282400	27283400	Bro...
27286400	27287400	Explore the whole map.
27287400	27289400	I mean, drowning people might have been a thing.
27289400	27291400	I've not done it yet.
27291400	27294400	I'm not even successful in doing my first hypnosis stream.
27295400	27296400	This is...
27296400	27300400	I'm getting absolutely spun about in this game.
27300400	27301400	You know that?
27302400	27305400	I'm about to discover an outpost.
27305400	27308400	I don't know what's going to happen when I get to it, but...
27309400	27314400	I'll literally discover the whole map before I unlock the next objective.
27317400	27318400	Oh, goodness me.
27318400	27321400	Everything's abandoned and there's the name on it.
27321400	27323400	I've freaking saved me.
27324400	27326400	So if I go down here...
27332400	27334400	It's still the wrong place.
27334400	27335400	I need to drop below.
27335400	27337400	Can I drop below in the upcoming thing?
27339400	27340400	Oh!
27343400	27344400	Did I miss that?
27346400	27348400	Please don't put me all the way back.
27348400	27350400	I have been travelling...
27350400	27351400	for day and...
27351400	27352400	Why would you just...
27352400	27353400	upon me?
27354400	27356400	I need to...
27358400	27362400	I need to gently go down on the map.
27363400	27365400	Gently go down on the map.
27366400	27369400	Getting the buggy, we're driving.
27369400	27373400	Because this is taking far too long to unlock the next objective.
27373400	27377400	I don't know how I perished from that, but whatever.
27377400	27379400	Right, so that's a crossing.
27379400	27380400	Right, so...
27380400	27381400	Oh!
27387400	27388400	Oh!
27395400	27396400	Okay.
27396400	27397400	Okay.
27397400	27399400	Okay, there's a really...
27399400	27400400	I'm getting trolled.
27400400	27402400	I'm getting trolled.
27403400	27404400	Where am I?
27404400	27405400	How...
27408400	27411400	I need to go backwards, like this way?
27411400	27413400	No, like this way?
27414400	27416400	Go back and do a U-turn.
27416400	27418400	Right, I need to do a U-turn.
27419400	27423400	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
27423400	27424400	I need...
27424400	27427400	I figured out how I get there, I think.
27428400	27429400	Oh my goodness.
27430400	27431400	That was a fun noise.
27431400	27435400	That was just the noise of pure shock and horror.
27435400	27436400	Oh, and I'm about to hit a Navi tri-
27436400	27438400	Of course I am, because why would I?
27438400	27440400	Why wouldn't I hit a massive Navi tri-
27440400	27441400	straight ahead?
27442400	27444400	And I'm about to uncluck right in front of them all.
27444400	27447400	Hi guys, do you just want to totally annihilate me one by one?
27447400	27451400	You might as well line up and have a little Congo going, you know?
27453400	27457400	Just to really drive at home how much I am dead meat in this game.
27458400	27460400	I like how, actually, I just...
27460400	27463400	I will say one thing, I like how I'm always, like, congratulated, like,
27463400	27465400	from how much I'm achieving,
27465400	27467400	but the reality of the situation is,
27467400	27470400	I am just, like, cheesing all the way through the battles.
27470400	27474400	I'm, like, literally not injuring any Navi whatsoever.
27474400	27477400	And they're like, wow, you're doing amazing out there on the battlefield.
27477400	27480400	And the reality, like, I'm just doing backflips all the time
27480400	27482400	and getting away from the enemy.
27483400	27487400	We finally got there, and yeah, that took so long.
27487400	27489400	Take us out to dinner first.
27491400	27493400	Mm-hmm.
27495400	27497400	This can happen to you.
27497400	27499400	You love nature.
27499400	27501400	That's what I get for loving nature.
27501400	27502400	That took...
27502400	27503400	Wait.
27505400	27507400	This teleport site was already on...
27512400	27513400	Mm.
27514400	27515400	Mm.
27516400	27517400	Mm-hmm.
27517400	27518400	Mm.
27519400	27520400	Mm-hmm.
27520400	27521400	Success.
27521400	27522400	I got it.
27522400	27524400	It was already unlocked.
27524400	27525400	It's fine.
27525400	27526400	It's fine. I'm fine.
27526400	27528400	Fine, that took me how long?
27528400	27529400	Together.
27529400	27530400	Please.
27530400	27532400	Try not to blow yourself up.
27532400	27534400	I passed the first one, honestly.
27534400	27536400	Right, what am I doing?
27537400	27539400	I can't believe that.
27539400	27541400	Ten thing.
27542400	27544400	Did they both blow up, or what?
27544400	27546400	Or just the one?
27547400	27549400	What am I blowing up?
27549400	27550400	Something, anyway.
27550400	27552400	Oh, I'm blowing up the freaking rocks
27552400	27554400	that blocked me from moving in the first place.
27554400	27556400	Hardy, hardy, hard, very funny.
27556400	27558400	Already freaking...
27558400	27559400	Ooh!
27559400	27561400	That's not supposed to happen.
27561400	27562400	What was it?
27565400	27567400	What am I getting shot by?
27567400	27569400	What's going on, guys?
27569400	27571400	Oh, this game's trolling me.
27573400	27575400	It seems like we've got company.
27576400	27578400	I don't like the samples.
27578400	27580400	Too many Viper Wars.
27580400	27582400	There's got to be some way to slow them down.
27582400	27583400	I'm on it.
27583400	27585400	There's got to be some way to slow them down.
27587400	27589400	Okay, we got a new unlock.
27589400	27590400	We're almost there.
27590400	27591400	Hold on.
27591400	27592400	Hold on for me.
27592400	27593400	You're so close.
27593400	27595400	Right, I've got healing four.
27595400	27597400	That's what I like to see.
27597400	27600400	Let us put down these.
27603400	27605400	Oh, is that a bomb?
27605400	27607400	That has to be a bomb.
27607400	27608400	Then it might be.
27608400	27610400	That's supposed to be a bomb, yeah.
27612400	27613400	Oh, right.
27613400	27616400	The bomb did activate even though I did it at the same time.
27620400	27622400	Okay, just to do it one more time.
27622400	27624400	One more time.
27628400	27629400	It's okay.
27629400	27630400	It's okay.
27630400	27632400	Right, they're both...
27633400	27635400	I'm getting slowed down by the...
27638400	27639400	Enough, enough, enough.
27639400	27640400	I'm getting slowed down.
27645400	27646400	That's all right.
27646400	27648400	You just want to spend more time.
27648400	27649400	Yeah, see how you're doing.
27649400	27650400	You have to say you're out,
27650400	27652400	but you know, you just have to do a lot.
27652400	27654400	You keep running through the dang thing.
27657400	27659400	Well, how about that?
27660400	27662400	Half as dear as older than I am.
27663400	27665400	Hydration check.
27671400	27673400	Windsor's orders to fill the power cell in the system.
27673400	27675400	Reactivate the thing.
27676400	27677400	Okay.
27677400	27679400	I'm analyzing the map
27679400	27682400	so I can basically go whatever way I want.
27682400	27685400	I just got the sweep since I was looking at it.
27685400	27687400	Dog was getting shot in the background.
27687400	27689400	Literally, the pervy thing.
27690400	27692400	It's not their fault they spawned on time, bro.
27696400	27697400	Me.
27697400	27698400	Oh, it's such a shame.
27698400	27699400	The pervy dogs.
27699400	27700400	Also me.
27700400	27701400	The dogs won't leave me alone.
27702400	27703400	I've had enough.
27704400	27705400	No.
27705400	27706400	That's too many.
27706400	27707400	No, that's one too many.
27707400	27708400	So, that's actually one too many.
27708400	27710400	That's three too many.
27710400	27712400	If any more come at me,
27712400	27713400	I'm out to be raging.
27714400	27715400	This is too much.
27715400	27717400	How are you supposed to genuinely do this?
27717400	27719400	Does the devs expect you to pause
27719400	27721400	and do this every single time?
27721400	27723400	There's no way.
27723400	27726400	I'm getting bit to death, though.
27727400	27729400	There's no way in heck.
27729400	27730400	I refuse.
27730400	27732400	I refuse.
27733400	27736400	Then we're going to get spat on by the flies
27736400	27738400	and then there's mere dogs.
27741400	27742400	Okay.
27742400	27744400	I somehow am making it.
27744400	27746400	Do I need to take a little to the...
27746400	27748400	Okay, I need to drop the buggy
27748400	27750400	when I get ahead here.
27751400	27754400	And then I'll have gone through the section pretty quickly.
27761400	27762400	There.
27762400	27764400	Okay, we're all good again.
27764400	27766400	That is a pretty plan, honestly.
27768400	27769400	I'm surprised.
27772400	27773400	Wow.
27774400	27776400	Okay, there's allies ahead.
27776400	27778400	That's all I like to see.
27781400	27783400	Mate, you're just letting that plan
27783400	27786400	absolutely decimate you for no reason.
27789400	27791400	Okay, this is like so much easier.
27792400	27793400	Can you actually burn the plants?
27793400	27794400	You know that?
27794400	27795400	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
27795400	27796400	It's too many.
27796400	27797400	Too many dogs.
27801400	27803400	Why are there so many multi-different colors?
27804400	27806400	But when you play, like, the Navi side,
27806400	27811400	where you're supposed to, like, be appreciating nature and stuff,
27811400	27813400	it's just like, you know...
27814400	27816400	Oh, for goodness' sake, what am I doing now?
27817400	27819400	If I have the backtrack one more time.
27821400	27823400	Right, thankfully I can teleport here.
27824400	27826400	You make me backtrack one more time game.
27826400	27828400	I'm going to have it out for you.
27828400	27829400	I might not self-clear.
27834400	27835400	Hmm.
27844400	27848400	We surely must be getting backtops soon with this one.
27849400	27853400	I feel like we grabbed all the songs, so what now?
27857400	27859400	So we're to get in Harper Deeds.
27864400	27866400	Um, the Navi side of the game is good.
27866400	27868400	The RDA side...
27869400	27871400	I'm just wanting it to be over with.
27871400	27873400	It's too hard.
27873400	27875400	Like, I'm genuinely hard.
27875400	27876400	No, I'm not hard.
27876400	27877400	Sorry.
27877400	27880400	The game is genuinely hard on the RDA side.
27886400	27889400	Okay, so Kendra's gotten doubts of what the thing is.
27889400	27890400	Nothing yet.
27890400	27891400	Let's keep focused.
27891400	27892400	You need to grab those shards.
27892400	27894400	Report back when you're...
27895400	27897400	And I don't mean that, I don't mean that.
27899400	27904400	So when we get the offer...
27906400	27908400	Why is it sending me...
27908400	27911400	This map is a nightmare to navigate.
27912400	27914400	I'm not being funny.
27915400	27917400	This is probably one of the hardest maps.
27918400	27921400	No, this will be the hardest map ever.
27923400	27926400	That I've had to navigate and do all this stuff in.
27926400	27927400	I don't even know where to start.
27927400	27929400	Maybe the one to my left?
27930400	27932400	If I take a left and then before...
27933400	27934400	No.
27934400	27936400	If I take a left and then take a right...
27938400	27940400	This is the filter for the human campaign.
27940400	27942400	Literally, like...
27943400	27945400	It's getting rough.
27946400	27948400	It's getting rough being told to go.
27948400	27953400	And I know they provide transport via the mechs and the...
27954400	27955400	Buggies and that.
27955400	27961400	But if you're going to do it that your buggy health makes you explode and you have to reload...
27961400	27964400	There's no point in providing that kind of thing.
27964400	27965400	Like it's just...
27965400	27966400	The name was going to be...
27966400	27967400	Wait, if I go...
27971400	27972400	Okay, I can resurrect it.
27972400	27973400	I need to take the first right though.
27973400	27974400	I can resurrect it.
27974400	27975400	It's fine.
27978400	27980400	Oh, please don't.
27980400	27982400	I'm going to run out of hiding.
27986400	27989400	I am running for my life.
27989400	27992400	I didn't even know they were going to do Thanos in the middle.
27992400	27993400	No, no.
27994400	27995400	Please leave me alone.
27995400	27999400	Please, I ask kindly and respectfully to respect my space.
28000400	28005400	I very kindly ask you to respect my social distance.
28005400	28007400	Social distance and keys?
28007400	28011400	I don't know if you've seen that Scottish meme where the guy goes social distance, please.
28013400	28015400	But he said it so politely.
28017400	28019400	I'm just hauling ass.
28019400	28021400	There's no way I'd make this without...
28022400	28023400	Oh, right.
28023400	28024400	Where is it?
28024400	28025400	It's up here, to be honest.
28027400	28028400	Okay.
28028400	28029400	Oh, this is actually...
28029400	28031400	Okay, I'll give the game Devs something.
28031400	28032400	This is actually kind of cool.
28032400	28034400	I like the classic like spiral up something.
28035400	28036400	I'll see it.
28036400	28037400	I'll see it.
28037400	28038400	Whoa.
28039400	28040400	Lovely!
28040400	28041400	Lovely.
28041400	28042400	Thank you, Devs.
28042400	28046400	Thank you, Devs, for putting a crack in the fricked rock stairwell.
28046400	28049400	I'll take everything I said back about this design.
28050400	28052400	Take it all back.
28053400	28057400	Random gap in the stairwell whilst you're getting whacked by Navi
28057400	28061400	and the dogs are biting your ankles at the bottom of the rock face.
28061400	28062400	And things are exploding.
28062400	28066400	There's like an exploding plant that's aiming on me right now.
28066400	28067400	That's what that...
28068400	28073400	Oh, oh, speaking of exploding plants, here's the bomb himself.
28073400	28075400	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
28075400	28076400	Okay, right.
28078400	28085400	I am now going to use that teleport to go back to that wiggly one up there.
28087400	28088400	No!
28099400	28102400	I've losing the will to live.
28102400	28104400	Just get me out of here.
28104400	28105400	Right.
28106400	28111400	If I go here and I take a right, I definitely have access to whatever that right one is.
28112400	28113400	Wasted.
28113400	28114400	Surely saved.
28114400	28115400	Yes, thank God.
28115400	28116400	Mission failed.
28116400	28117400	I'll get him next time.
28119400	28123400	Just spawn me on whatever you want.
28123400	28124400	It's fine.
28124400	28125400	I need to take a right?
28125400	28126400	Like this way?
28126400	28128400	Yeah, go that way.
28128400	28130400	And get her gone.
28134400	28136400	Is this the last NDA?
28136400	28137400	NDA.
28138400	28141400	I just saw that in the corner of my eye.
28144400	28145400	No.
28146400	28149400	You can AI lock to something else because it ain't me, buddy.
28149400	28151400	It ain't me that you're AI locking to.
28152400	28153400	Get out of here.
28153400	28154400	Get out of here with that.
28154400	28156400	I'm no even entertaining.
28156400	28159400	I am taking so much fall damage just to...
28159400	28161400	Wait, I've already been here before.
28161400	28163400	I just need to go left now.
28164400	28168400	I might actually have to pop, heal, and...
28169400	28171400	Yeah, okay, lovely.
28171400	28172400	Can you...
28172400	28173400	Yeah, do that.
28173400	28175400	Yeah, and then get the heck out of here.
28177400	28180400	Oh, my gosh, golly.
28180400	28182400	This is just running similar.
28182400	28184400	I'm literally Tracer from Overwatch.
28184400	28186400	Maybe I'll be Tracer.
28186400	28187400	Should've been Widowmaker.
28187400	28188400	What about Widowmaker?
28188400	28189400	What about Bastion?
28189400	28190400	They're Bastion.
28190400	28191400	You're a race of Winston.
28191400	28193400	I will not be Winston.
28194400	28195400	How about Genji?
28195400	28197400	I'm already Genji.
28197400	28198400	What about McCree?
28198400	28199400	I already chose McCree.
28199400	28200400	Right.
28200400	28202400	What's your idea?
28202400	28204400	Should've been...
28204400	28206400	Any other...
28206400	28210400	Right, if I come back the way I came from,
28210400	28213400	I can hit whatever that big sector is.
28214400	28217400	I assume this has to be the last mission.
28217400	28220400	Like, this is for map design...
28222400	28223400	For map...
28223400	28225400	Maybe not right now,
28225400	28227400	whilst all the navi are on my butthole.
28227400	28229400	That'd be great not to get some luck.
28230400	28231400	Um...
28232400	28234400	Oh, just make me Invis.
28234400	28236400	Should I pick Mercy?
28236400	28238400	Okay, watch your stream.
28238400	28241400	Mercy up in one hour ten.
28241400	28243400	I repeat, Mercy up in one hour ten.
28243400	28247400	I believe everyone is offline for the day,
28247400	28251400	but Mercy is online in one hour ten.
28251400	28255400	And of course, my Invis is gonna run out right on this guy.
28255400	28258400	Have I got straight ahead, actually?
28258400	28259400	I don't know what to do.
28259400	28261400	I'm getting so close to him.
28261400	28263400	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
28263400	28265400	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
28265400	28267400	We knew, we knew.
28267400	28271400	We knew there's no point in being pretending.
28272400	28273400	Azura is still playing one shot.
28273400	28275400	Oh, Azura is still on map.
28275400	28277400	Apologies, Azura is currently playing one shot
28277400	28279400	if you are interested in that.
28279400	28280400	If you are...
28280400	28282400	Buy Azura, buy Azura, buy Azura!
28282400	28284400	She's playing one shot.
28284400	28286400	Which is not super hot,
28286400	28289400	which I actually thought it was super hot.
28289400	28292400	I am currently sharing tree branches.
28294400	28295400	I don't know what to do
28295400	28297400	because I'm gonna get knocked off,
28297400	28299400	which is not what I want at all.
28299400	28301400	So I'm actually gonna have to fight.
28301400	28302400	I can't believe it.
28302400	28304400	I'm actually gonna have to fight for one.
28304400	28305400	Yeah, sorry.
28305400	28307400	We cannot be sharing tree branches.
28307400	28312400	These trees are too skinny for me to not perish.
28313400	28314400	Buy Azura, buy Azura.
28314400	28316400	What is getting me now?
28316400	28318400	Oh my God, it's a boss.
28318400	28320400	This is a boss ring?
28320400	28323400	This, this is a boss ring.
28323400	28325400	You have got to be kidding me.
28327400	28328400	I don't...
28328400	28332400	This is exactly what I didn't want to happen.
28332400	28335400	I'm sorry, but he's gonna have to come down here
28335400	28337400	and fight me like a man.
28337400	28341400	I can clear all these guys at least.
28343400	28345400	Ooh, I'm not gonna enjoy this fight.
28345400	28347400	I can tell you that much.
28347400	28350400	Yeah, I need to clear out all the other little guys first.
28350400	28352400	Well, little, I'm little,
28352400	28355400	but there's literally nothing I can do
28355400	28358400	until all of these guys are gone.
28360400	28362400	I'm just, I'm just...
28365400	28366400	Relax.
28366400	28368400	I am literally, they are going invisible
28368400	28371400	so I can't see anything.
28373400	28374400	Okay, back off.
28374400	28375400	Seriously, back off.
28375400	28377400	This isn't funny anymore.
28377400	28378400	I'm no laughing.
28378400	28379400	I'm no getting sniped.
28379400	28380400	I'm no getting sniped.
28380400	28382400	Well, the quest...
28382400	28383400	No.
28385400	28387400	Rob, Rob, you're gonna have to give me a chance.
28387400	28390400	AI, AI, you're gonna have to give me a chance
28390400	28392400	to clear these guys out.
28392400	28394400	And now the dogs are joining in.
28394400	28396400	It's fine.
28396400	28398400	It's fine.
28398400	28400400	Everyone just freaking unanimously...
28400400	28401400	Gang...
28401400	28402400	No, I can't say that word.
28402400	28404400	What do you know what I mean?
28405400	28406400	This is game.
28406400	28408400	Rob, Rob, Rob.
28408400	28409400	What am I supposed to do?
28409400	28410400	What am I supposed to do?
28410400	28411400	Go and be real.
28411400	28412400	Be real.
28412400	28413400	Be real.
28413400	28414400	Be hashtag real.
28415400	28417400	These are gonna need gears to break.
28417400	28420400	Gear break, gear break, gear break, gear break, gear break, gear break.
28420400	28422400	Are you guys infinitely spawning?
28422400	28425400	Or is this just getting really unlucky?
28425400	28428400	Are they infinitely spawning or am I just...
28428400	28429400	Oh, right, no.
28429400	28432400	Let's get rid of the freaking flame sword
28432400	28435400	because it's just absolutely nothing for us.
28436400	28438400	A bush boss!
28438400	28440400	Right, well, I'm sure whatever.
28440400	28441400	Wait.
28441400	28443400	Is everyone on go right now?
28447400	28449400	I've killed his...
28449400	28450400	thing.
28451400	28453400	Oh, his navi's gone, so he's dead.
28453400	28456400	Oh, his navi's gone, so he's a human now?
28462400	28463400	Am I done?
28463400	28464400	No!
28464400	28465400	Oh!
28469400	28471400	This has to be the last mission.
28475400	28477400	Hold on, let me reload.
28478400	28479400	What's going on here?
28479400	28480400	Here.
28480400	28481400	Wait, hold on, I need ammo.
28482400	28484400	He, like, flew off.
28484400	28487400	I'm sorry, but the full damage would have been enough.
28487400	28490400	Oh, thank goodness, Gravy, he's perished.
28490400	28492400	Don't ever come back again.
28492400	28494400	You're not fun to deal with.
28494400	28496400	Right, where'd any go?
28496400	28501400	I'll go here, and then if I go southward, I'll get the next one.
28501400	28504400	The anti-strongy coalition has been founded by the navi.
28504400	28505400	Literally...
28507400	28509400	Literally let me destroy nature and peace.
28509400	28511400	I'll go this way?
28512400	28513400	Yes.
28513400	28515400	Let's get to it.
28517400	28519400	Let's get to it.
28519400	28521400	Everybody look for two.
28525400	28526400	Oh, you weren't...
28526400	28527400	Wait, what are they fighting?
28527400	28528400	They're fighting each other.
28528400	28530400	Right, go, no, no, go fight the navi.
28530400	28531400	Then they border with me.
28531400	28533400	You were fighting him a minute ago, all willy-nilly.
28533400	28535400	Then you look at me all of a sudden.
28535400	28537400	No, I haven't.
28537400	28539400	What am I supposed to be doing here?
28544400	28545400	Hold on.
28545400	28547400	Put me up here so I can see.
28547400	28549400	Oh, I'm supposed to go down.
28551400	28553400	Oh, that's not nice.
28553400	28554400	Who's doing that?
28554400	28555400	What's that?
28555400	28556400	Whoever's doing that, you stop that.
28556400	28558400	I can see you shooting it, but I can't see you.
28558400	28559400	Yeah, stop.
28560400	28562400	Cease your activities.
28563400	28565400	Cease your activities.
28566400	28568400	That's ridiculous, the plant.
28568400	28571400	Being able to freaking send off a bomb like that.
28573400	28575400	Who wrote this game?
28575400	28577400	I'd say I can write better, but that's not true.
28578400	28582400	No, I have to go all the way around to get down there.
28585400	28588400	There's no way to fall down there safely.
28588400	28592400	Well, well, I need to do a big ol' U-turn.
28592400	28594400	Do you hate the navi yet?
28595400	28599400	No, I hate playing the RDA, say, to deal with the navi.
28599400	28602400	I can see that much very strongly.
28602400	28605400	But I don't understand how there's plants around here
28605400	28607400	that the navi can claim,
28607400	28609400	because it's not like I can utilize it.
28614400	28615400	I'm just bombing everything.
28615400	28618400	Actually, I probably just bomb myself, you know that.
28618400	28620400	Unless I can get out here fast enough.
28621400	28624400	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we need to do that.
28625400	28628400	Okay, please tell me I did them all.
28630400	28632400	I didn't do them all?
28634400	28636400	Oh, it was to grab a crystal.
28636400	28638400	My apologies, didn't realize.
28639400	28641400	My apologies, my apologies.
28641400	28644400	I suck, I suck, but it's okay.
28644400	28646400	Please don't do that, please don't do that.
28646400	28648400	Please don't corner me, because that's not really...
28649400	28651400	Ooh, not good.
28651400	28653400	I am in the rock, I am in the rock.
28653400	28655400	I am in the rock, I am in the rock, I am in the rock, I am in the rock.
28655400	28658400	Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out.
28658400	28659400	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
28659400	28661400	You can throw me in that direction, throw me in that direction.
28661400	28664400	Ractomy! Right, no, no, no, no, you're taking the piss.
28664400	28668400	You're taking the piss, you're taking the piss, you're taking the piss.
28669400	28671400	You don't need to do that.
28671400	28673400	Please stop embodying on me.
28673400	28677400	I'm trying to dodge the aim, but I don't have health unlock.
28677400	28678400	I can heal now.
28678400	28680400	I'm gonna go next.
28680400	28682400	I can almost go in viz, I can almost go in viz.
28682400	28685400	Hold on, where's the last thing that I need to go to?
28687400	28689400	If I take...
28691400	28693400	If I just go back to where I came from?
28693400	28695400	That sounds...
28695400	28698400	I mean, if I go back to that hotel, where did I get there though?
28700400	28702400	I go forward and take a right?
28704400	28706400	Surely.
28706400	28709400	I'm a bit disoriented on this map.
28709400	28711400	If I take a right on this log...
28712400	28716400	If I get on that log, then I should be able to...
28717400	28718400	Do you mind?
28718400	28721400	Honestly, give me a jumpscare whenever he is over...
28721400	28723400	Like, hanging about, honestly, I can't believe it.
28723400	28726400	I can't believe that you're hanging about on your planet, honestly.
28726400	28728400	It's just so good.
28728400	28731400	They really wanted you to know that the RDA or the bad guys
28731400	28734400	are literally so punishing to play the RDA side.
28734400	28736400	Sorry, but like, Navi is so easy.
28736400	28740400	I'm gonna send over critical, but I don't think the game is balanced well.
28740400	28744400	It just seems like, unless I'm missing the gun
28744400	28747400	that you're supposed to use in quotation marks,
28747400	28750400	I am getting brutally...
28750400	28752400	Oh no, I don't use the teleport.
28752400	28754400	I do a 180.
28754400	28757400	And I go this way, just to make triple sure.
28757400	28760400	I do not want to take off in the wrong direction.
28760400	28762400	It's punishing, but fun.
28762400	28766400	If it's fun for you to watch me get punished, then sure.
28766400	28769400	Punish me away, but this is...
28770400	28773400	Raging just thinks I'm just doing so bad.
28774400	28777400	I can hear the end again.
28780400	28783400	They gave you a guard down for stealth, no run kills.
28783400	28785400	Oh, honestly.
28785400	28787400	Watch over here.
28789400	28791400	I hope this is the area.
28791400	28794400	I'm gonna cry if this is like a dead end up here.
28795400	28798400	Both to play and watch you, honestly.
28799400	28803400	I never understood streamers that can punish themselves over and over with the same game.
28803400	28805400	I just don't...
28805400	28808400	Wow, that's what I don't want.
28808400	28810400	None of that.
28810400	28813400	I swear if there's a dog behind me, stop it!
28818400	28820400	Okay, that's him there.
28820400	28826400	I'm really not interested in going down to get wrecked by all the other NPCs as well,
28826400	28828400	but I don't think...
28829400	28833400	I almost just forfeited all that progress right there.
28835400	28838400	That's my shotgun, and you put that away so I can do rounds.
28838400	28840400	Who are you?
28843400	28845400	This is getting rough.
28849400	28852400	Oh, come on, come on, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.
28852400	28857400	You know you want to, you know you want to, you know you want to get that health bar to zero for me, baby.
28858400	28860400	Oh no, fall down it.
28862400	28865400	Right, I'm not going to go in the vines next time.
28865400	28867400	He was honestly taking a hammer in.
28867400	28870400	I feel sorry for making you play the RDA side.
28870400	28875400	Okay, I've respawned in the area, which is good but bad because the NPCs are literally all...
28875400	28876400	Okay, okay.
28876400	28879400	We actually didn't lose the progress on the health bar.
28879400	28882400	I don't think I've seen that before, but lol.
28887400	28888400	Oof.
28893400	28897400	Oh wow, just spawn all the NPCs together, I don't know.
28898400	28899400	No, it's fine.
28899400	28901400	I didn't want to live anyway.
28903400	28905400	Alright, I won't be showing that to him.
28906400	28909400	Oh, come on.
28912400	28915400	Oh, let me reload, let me reload.
28915400	28917400	And I can deal with you.
28917400	28921400	Oh wow, I'm actually out of ammo, that's how much you've made me spawn that ship.
28922400	28923400	No.
28924400	28926400	Can you aim? Can you aim? Hello?
28926400	28929400	Oh, for crying out loud.
28932400	28938400	Can you aim at the freaking guy that is literally one millimeter from your eyeball?
28939400	28941400	Yeah, you're getting...
28942400	28944400	I thought I dealt with you.
28946400	28951400	Don't even bother, Mike.
28951400	28953400	Was he shooting the buggy?
28953400	28955400	I think he was, honestly.
28957400	28960400	Oh, this game is going to give me a heart attack.
28961400	28969400	Right, I just need to make it back to this person and then I think I'm done with the worst map ever.
28969400	28976400	This map belongs under my sweaty feet.
28977400	28982400	Never to be allowed to breathe fresh, dry air again.
28983400	28984400	That was awful.
28985400	28988400	And I wish not to ever be subjected to this.
28989400	28991400	Because, oh my gosh.
28991400	28995400	I know there's buggies everywhere but I don't even want to get in them because they just explode in a millisecond.
28996400	28998400	Goes to the trash.
28998400	29000400	Ah, so it's a good map. No.
29001400	29004400	It deserves nothing but my manky, sweaty grippers.
29005400	29006400	Paramersweep.
29008400	29009400	Oh my god.
29009400	29010400	Don't...
29011400	29015400	Don't give me another map like hanging gardens again.
29015400	29018400	Hanging gardens? It makes me want to hang myself.
29018400	29020400	Thank you. I'll be here all week.
29020400	29021400	And...
29026400	29028400	Oh, I've still not defeated Harper.
29028400	29029400	Okay, I guess we'll go.
29029400	29031400	Another map after this.
29037400	29038400	Hi, officer.
29047400	29048400	More.
29048400	29050400	More. It's not over.
29051400	29053400	Wait, say it again with the bidons.
29053400	29055400	Wait, say what again? Tell me.
29055400	29057400	Tell me I've already forgotten what I'm supposed to say.
29057400	29059400	What did I say? I've already forgotten.
29064400	29065400	What am I supposed to say?
29066400	29068400	I'm ready. I'm ready for what I'm supposed to say.
29070400	29073400	Oh, what's the map called? I've already forgotten.
29073400	29075400	I just picked up a signal way out there.
29075400	29077400	It's not much, but it's something.
29077400	29078400	Alright.
29078400	29080400	The map's called hanging gardens?
29080400	29082400	More like I want to hang myself.
29085400	29087400	Thank you. Thank you.
29087400	29089400	Appreciate it. Appreciate it.
29093400	29094400	Oh my god.
29094400	29096400	I've still not done another fucking map.
29096400	29098400	I just want to go there and...
29098400	29099400	I actually have to go there.
29099400	29100400	I actually have to go there.
29100400	29101400	I've never seen someone say,
29102400	29104400	Why are we still in the front?
29104400	29105400	Relatable.
29105400	29107400	We'll be here all week.
29107400	29109400	We'll be here all week on this freaking one map.
29109400	29111400	On this one map.
29111400	29114400	They really did not want anyone to have fun on the RDS.
29114400	29115400	Like literally.
29119400	29122400	I want to say this is the Harper fight.
29122400	29124400	And then I think that's it.
29124400	29125400	No.
29126400	29127400	No.
29127400	29129400	I'm not even scared anymore.
29129400	29130400	I am annoyed.
29131400	29133400	If I take a right,
29134400	29135400	then
29135400	29138400	either way I'm going to make it to the location.
29139400	29141400	Some people enjoy suffering,
29141400	29142400	myself included.
29142400	29144400	But do you enjoy watching suffering?
29144400	29145400	Like,
29145400	29148400	I actually don't mind watching like a binding of Isaac runs.
29148400	29151400	And if the person like struggles to get through it,
29151400	29152400	but still wins,
29152400	29153400	like I don't mind watching.
29153400	29155400	Like I find it quite entertaining.
29156400	29157400	Alright.
29157400	29159400	If I take the vines across.
29159400	29160400	Yeah.
29160400	29161400	Oh, and there you are.
29161400	29162400	Thank you.
29163400	29164400	Yeah.
29164400	29165400	Yeah.
29165400	29166400	Yeah.
29166400	29167400	Please don't do that.
29167400	29168400	Oh, wait.
29168400	29170400	No, they're going to push me off the freaking vines.
29170400	29171400	If I go up.
29171400	29172400	Stop.
29172400	29173400	Stop spanking me.
29173400	29176400	It's Emmy who has that audio this month.
29176400	29177400	Okay.
29177400	29178400	Not me.
29178400	29180400	I do not have that kind of audio this month.
29182400	29183400	I need to go down.
29184400	29186400	No, I better not need to go down.
29186400	29187400	Some of them they are.
29190400	29191400	What?
29191400	29192400	I need...
29192400	29193400	Well,
29193400	29196400	I'm a bit scared to go on this in all honesty.
29198400	29199400	Oh.
29203400	29204400	Right.
29204400	29205400	A boss fight with Harper.
29218400	29219400	Got it.
29221400	29223400	What kind of audio do we have this month?
29224400	29226400	I have sent train in one.
29227400	29230400	I'm trying to remember the other two off the top of my hand.
29231400	29233400	I should kind of recall.
29233400	29235400	One of them is part of my 1.4.
29236400	29240400	I have two four-parter series and part one comes out.
29244400	29247400	I almost just did what you think I almost just did.
29248400	29251400	I almost fell off the map doing that man over there.
29251400	29253400	That was very scary.
29255400	29257400	Yeah, rather not you should have changed yourself to suffering.
29258400	29261400	Oh, that just cancelled my invisibility.
29261400	29262400	Okay.
29262400	29263400	That's fine.
29263400	29264400	No, I totally didn't need that.
29264400	29267400	It's not like the cooldown time is like a whole 60 seconds or something.
29268400	29269400	Oh.
29273400	29274400	Oh.
29278400	29279400	Yes.
29279400	29280400	Thank you.
29280400	29281400	Please.
29281400	29282400	Oh, shoot them.
29282400	29283400	I can't be bothered anymore.
29284400	29285400	After this,
29285400	29286400	I don't really like...
29287400	29288400	Oh, after things,
29288400	29290400	I don't really like when you have that time.
29293400	29294400	Seals women the year.
29296400	29297400	If this human is just miserable,
29297400	29298400	the whole time is in this one.
29299400	29300400	It's not too bad.
29300400	29301400	Like honestly,
29301400	29303400	I'm actually enjoying to see what the RDA said is,
29303400	29306400	but this map
29306400	29308400	size is
29309400	29310400	mercenary.
29310400	29311400	Oh, new outfit.
29311400	29312400	All right.
29312400	29313400	All right.
29313400	29314400	Girl moment.
29314400	29315400	Let's see what we look like.
29315400	29316400	Wait.
29317400	29318400	Oh, right.
29318400	29319400	No.
29319400	29321400	So this is Max.
29323400	29325400	Max protection.
29325400	29327400	Well, I'll take Max protection.
29328400	29330400	And now we need to go
29332400	29333400	this way.
29334400	29335400	What's that?
29336400	29337400	I'm to take one of these.
29340400	29341400	Shoot.
29342400	29343400	How do I shoot?
29343400	29344400	I've already fun.
29344400	29345400	Um, no.
29346400	29347400	Oh, A.G.
29347400	29348400	Louise.
29348400	29349400	Let's do that one.
29352400	29353400	What's over here?
29354400	29355400	Oh.
29359400	29360400	Oh.
29361400	29362400	Lost Cathedral?
29362400	29363400	Cathedral?
29365400	29368400	It kind of reminds me of the underground cave
29369400	29370400	in Skyrim.
29372400	29374400	Why is the music even scarier?
29375400	29376400	Oh, please be a small map.
29377400	29378400	Oh, it's a small map.
29378400	29379400	Thank y'all.
29382400	29383400	Thank you.
29383400	29384400	I fit small.
29386400	29387400	What just got me?
29387400	29388400	Who?
29389400	29390400	Are they above me?
29390400	29392400	It must be the Navi above me.
29395400	29396400	Okay, the Navi.
29396400	29397400	Oh, there he is.
29401400	29402400	Mm-hmm.
29405400	29407400	Um, I have a problem.
29409400	29413400	And that problem is everyone has height advantage over me.
29416400	29417400	Yeah, this.
29418400	29421400	Unless they come down and bite me,
29421400	29423400	I am in so much trouble.
29426400	29427400	Oh, dear.
29427400	29429400	I'm going to get sniped out of that.
29429400	29431400	I don't have infinite ammo.
29431400	29433400	I can't be messing around like that.
29433400	29434400	I don't have infinite ammo.
29435400	29437400	Is there really no way for me to go up?
29442400	29445400	Unless it's over here I get up?
29448400	29449400	No.
29451400	29454400	Wow, this is like really rare to see in a video game.
29454400	29456400	Unless I'm just, I don't play many video games.
29456400	29461400	I really do not recall levels where you can't even reach the person.
29462400	29464400	I don't know, maybe I'm being silly.
29465400	29467400	Yeah, see this is...
29467400	29469400	Right, you can go.
29469400	29471400	Right, one down.
29471400	29474400	I don't know how much health he has, but...
29474400	29478400	Bro, I can't, I cannot be spraying him with pistols, like...
29480400	29482400	Oh wait, I have infinite ammo here.
29483400	29485400	Silly me, silly Billy.
29486400	29487400	Hold on.
29489400	29491400	I saw that shooting.
29493400	29495400	I just spray him the entire time then?
29496400	29498400	I mean, I'll do it, don't think I won't.
29499400	29502400	You don't have to tell me twice if it's a spring-free mission, sure.
29502400	29505400	He just runs around in circles over and over.
29506400	29509400	Sadly, I can't seem to reach the other NPCs.
29509400	29512400	Oh, they're attacking me, they're actually getting me.
29512400	29514400	They're jumping me!
29514400	29516400	Yeah, whoa!
29517400	29520400	The AI is so brutal as a nazi.
29521400	29523400	Sorry, hold on a minute.
29523400	29525400	I'm starting to...
29526400	29529400	I don't know if I should actually just focus on the main guy, you know what?
29530400	29534400	Instead of the... I don't know if they're infinitely respawning or not.
29535400	29538400	That's the reason why I want to clear them out,
29538400	29543400	but I'm getting the feeling they're infinitely respawning.
29543400	29544400	Maybe?
29544400	29547400	Oh, I just destroyed that plant.
29547400	29548400	Where is he?
29548400	29549400	No.
29553400	29555400	Wow, I'm like actually struggling.
29555400	29556400	Wow.
29556400	29557400	Okay, half health.
29557400	29560400	I think just moan, I think just moan down.
29560400	29562400	That's the best I got.
29562400	29564400	Oh, and I'm out of ammo.
29568400	29570400	Just moan down.
29571400	29572400	I'm just gonna tank it.
29572400	29573400	I am, I really am.
29573400	29575400	I'm just gonna tank it.
29576400	29577400	Where is he going?
29580400	29584400	Yeah, this definitely is giving, like, battle dome unending.
29587400	29589400	Thanks for waiting around until I stand up again.
29589400	29591400	I actually do appreciate that, AI.
29591400	29593400	Oh, that's not good.
29593400	29595400	That's really not good.
29599400	29602400	This is what I was worried about,
29602400	29605400	but there's definitely more spawning,
29605400	29611400	and I'm not quite sure what the answer is.
29612400	29614400	Other than spray him.
29615400	29617400	That's really the best I can do.
29617400	29620400	Just hope that my weak cross here is going on.
29620400	29622400	He is getting staggered.
29622400	29623400	He is getting staggered.
29623400	29625400	There's no denying that.
29625400	29628400	But the Navi are getting out of control up here.
29630400	29632400	I don't have high...
29632400	29634400	The plants keep respawning.
29634400	29637400	I don't know if maybe the plants have got something to do with it.
29638400	29640400	The battle rifle can help you in this moment.
29640400	29641400	Are you the battle rifle?
29641400	29642400	No, you're not.
29643400	29644400	Wait.
29645400	29646400	No, you're the shotgun.
29646400	29647400	Wait, am I dumb?
29648400	29649400	What have I got?
29649400	29650400	Shotgun and shotgun.
29650400	29652400	Ah, well, that makes a lot of sense
29652400	29654400	where I don't feel like nothing's happening right now.
29654400	29656400	What gun?
29657400	29659400	The battle rifle.
29659400	29660400	Battle rifle.
29660400	29661400	Or any head launcher,
29661400	29662400	Neil Gunn.
29663400	29665400	Is it actually called battle rifle?
29665400	29666400	I've got an assault rifle,
29666400	29668400	but I think that's what I've got.
29668400	29670400	Is she rifle?
29671400	29673400	I've got machine gun standard.
29674400	29675400	Hold on, heal up.
29678400	29679400	Okay, let's try this.
29679400	29680400	Oh, hold on.
29680400	29681400	Hold on, hold on.
29681400	29682400	I'm just fluffing on my face.
29682400	29683400	Hold on.
29685400	29686400	Are you damaging?
29687400	29688400	Leave it.
29689400	29690400	Oh, okay, okay.
29692400	29693400	It's like a triple barf.
29693400	29694400	Okay, it's triple barf.
29695400	29696400	Little...
29698400	29699400	We're trying.
29699400	29700400	We're trying.
29700400	29701400	We're trying.
29701400	29702400	That's the main thing.
29702400	29703400	We can do it.
29703400	29704400	We can 100% do it.
29704400	29705400	I believe.
29705400	29706400	I believe.
29706400	29708400	It's just going to take its sweet time,
29708400	29711400	especially if the game just constantly is resupplying
29711400	29713400	with new Navi for this guy.
29714400	29716400	It makes me think this is the last boss fight
29716400	29718400	in the last map, though,
29718400	29721400	because this is big.
29721400	29723400	Like, this is big fight.
29723400	29724400	This is...
29726400	29728400	I'm going to put protection prayer on.
29728400	29731400	I can hardly see his body to shoot, though.
29732400	29733400	Okay, yeah.
29733400	29734400	Okay, okay, okay.
29734400	29735400	We're freaking dead.
29735400	29736400	We don't have to do...
29736400	29737400	Okay, okay.
29744400	29745400	Oh, he's mad.
29747400	29749400	I foiled his plans.
29749400	29750400	He said,
29752400	29753400	Okay, let's...
29753400	29754400	Okay, okay.
29754400	29755400	Hold on.
29755400	29756400	Let me get up.
29756400	29757400	Let me get up.
29757400	29758400	Let me go up.
29758400	29759400	Let me go up.
29760400	29761400	Hello?
29762400	29763400	Hello?
29765400	29767400	I can't even heal,
29767400	29769400	because I'm getting pushed against a wall.
29772400	29773400	Oh, I've swapped to pistols.
29773400	29775400	Thank you for swapping to pistols.
29775400	29777400	The most useless out of everything.
29777400	29779400	No, it's very much needed right now.
29779400	29780400	Very much needed.
29780400	29782400	The most useless...
29782400	29783400	No.
29783400	29784400	I need to go.
29784400	29786400	My invis...
29786400	29788400	Yeah, my invis literally...
29788400	29790400	I'm going to heal on a rock.
29790400	29792400	I'm going to heal on a rock.
29792400	29794400	Yeah, and I'm pressed up against it,
29794400	29796400	so there's actually nothing I can do.
29796400	29798400	Dog, you're going to have to let me breathe
29798400	29799400	through your sleep video game.
29799400	29800400	This is like...
29800400	29801400	I'm just going to run away.
29801400	29803400	It's the best thing I can do right now.
29804400	29805400	Do not engage.
29805400	29806400	Do not engage.
29808400	29810400	Oh, come on.
29813400	29815400	Who said the same thing?
29815400	29817400	Who said the same thing?
29825400	29827400	Oh, no.
29829400	29830400	No, no.
29830400	29832400	I did not want this.
29832400	29834400	Oh, goodness.
29834400	29836400	Yeah, I think I've actually died.
29836400	29837400	You know that?
29837400	29839400	I've only got one cell thing.
29841400	29843400	I'm glad I have protection up,
29843400	29845400	but...
29851400	29853400	I actually don't have faith.
29853400	29854400	You know that?
29854400	29855400	I'm losing faith.
29855400	29857400	I do not believe...
29857400	29859400	unless I can grab these quick enough.
29859400	29860400	I literally don't have a revive,
29860400	29862400	if I go down, by the way.
29862400	29864400	Yeah, see this?
29864400	29868400	The amount of abilities they use...
29868400	29870400	I'm sure I could probably be
29870400	29872400	utilizing my abilities better,
29872400	29874400	but this prayer protection...
29874400	29877400	is so constant!
29878400	29881400	It's so fucking constant!
29886400	29889400	I really hope nothing else respawns.
29889400	29891400	I can't tolerate this.
29892400	29895400	I don't think I should have been using that other gun.
29895400	29897400	No, that's shotgun.
29902400	29904400	If he's gonna get stuck,
29904400	29906400	I will happily take that, please.
29910400	29912400	Please, stun lock,
29912400	29915400	and don't do anything different.
29916400	29917400	Oh, my God.
29917400	29919400	More spawned in.
29920400	29923400	Please, I literally don't have a revive.
29923400	29926400	I honestly don't have a revive.
29926400	29929400	You know, I have ammo, look at me.
29932400	29934400	Where did he go?
29940400	29942400	Oh, lovely.
29946400	29948400	I feel like a Lara Croft.
29948400	29950400	Oh, my God!
29952400	29954400	Did I have reef?
29954400	29956400	I don't even have it.
29957400	29959400	Please!
29959400	29961400	No more battles!
29961400	29964400	Please, I'm on my knees!
29965400	29967400	Oh, I can't.
29967400	29969400	I genuinely, wholeheartedly,
29969400	29972400	I'm not gonna make it if they make me do it anymore.
29972400	29974400	Is that up here?
29974400	29976400	No, sorry.
29977400	29979400	I need to find revives,
29979400	29981400	but I don't have any more revives,
29981400	29984400	and I keep getting locked in.
29984400	29986400	On your knees, I'm not even kidding.
29986400	29988400	On my knees, please, devs,
29988400	29990400	tell me you didn't do it anymore.
29990400	29992400	I think I'm genuinely gonna lose this.
29992400	29993400	Like, lose the game,
29993400	29995400	because I don't have a revive,
29995400	29997400	and I don't know what happens if you perish
29997400	29999400	without a revive.
30000400	30003400	On your knees for a head pat.
30004400	30007400	Oh, I genuinely don't have a revive.
30007400	30010400	I feel like we're about to enter some massive boss fight.
30010400	30012400	Oh, my God.
30013400	30016400	Get me out of the Hanging Gardens.
30017400	30020400	You're dying to keep your town, really?
30020400	30022400	Shocking behavior.
30023400	30025400	Oh.
30025400	30028400	How am I back here again?
30039400	30042400	I think because I'm not killing...
30042400	30044400	Navi.
30046400	30048400	Well, teammates and all, right?
30048400	30050400	Yeah, right.
30050400	30052400	Meet me back at Hell's Gate.
30052400	30054400	This should be the last harmonic.
30056400	30058400	No.
30063400	30066400	I have protection for now.
30066400	30068400	I think it is because I'm not...
30068400	30069400	What are you...
30069400	30071400	They're all aiming on something.
30071400	30073400	Because I'm not picking, like,
30073400	30074400	Heart and Navi,
30074400	30076400	I'm not able to pick up more revives,
30076400	30078400	but, like, I'm in danger.
30083400	30084400	I don't know if I'm going to win this.
30084400	30086400	I don't know what happened, so...
30088400	30090400	On your knees ready to create a James Cameron himself,
30090400	30092400	literally.
30092400	30094400	I'm like, did they play test this
30094400	30095400	for, like, noobs?
30095400	30097400	This is, like, soul play?
30097400	30099400	Monroe's gone missing.
30099400	30101400	Things are going bad to worse.
30101400	30103400	You'll have to upload the harmonic without him.
30103400	30105400	Monroe's missing the guy?
30105400	30107400	He's been rounding up the scientists
30107400	30109400	and anyone else who questions his authority.
30109400	30111400	We're running out of time.
30111400	30113400	We need to find that door...
30113400	30115400	He really is the body, jeez.
30115400	30117400	It has to be you who activates the emulator.
30117400	30119400	If you get control of the well of souls,
30119400	30121400	you can put a stop to this madness.
30121400	30123400	Get started.
30123400	30125400	I'm gonna go check for Monroe.
30126400	30128400	Okay, let's deal.
30128400	30130400	So we are about to hit endgame.
30130400	30132400	Oh, yeah, we're in the endgame now.
30134400	30137400	But Alcooo actually kills your scientists, man.
30137400	30139400	Yeah.
30141400	30143400	They probes didn't play any at all.
30143400	30145400	They had one play tester.
30145400	30147400	And he just did the Navi side as well.
30149400	30151400	Are you trying to finish the campaign?
30151400	30153400	Yes, we finished the Navi.
30153400	30155400	We finished the RDA side.
30155400	30157400	However, he's not in his office.
30159400	30161400	What's that?
30165400	30167400	Resource development?
30167400	30169400	Oh, wow, I actually can't go...
30173400	30175400	I actually can't go in his office space.
30175400	30177400	That's a very small detail.
30184400	30186400	Oh, well.
30188400	30190400	The office is scared.
30190400	30192400	Alcooo is always evil.
30192400	30194400	Yeah, he's like evil till the end.
30194400	30197400	We can do it. We just not need to die.
30197400	30201400	Or get walled off by like three Navi at once.
30204400	30209400	Going into his office space to take his red line stapler?
30209400	30211400	Stapler?
30212400	30214400	Why are you so stupid?
30218400	30220400	Okay, she gives me a thumbs up now.
30233400	30237400	Wait, so you need to stop Falco in either scenario, anyway?
30241400	30243400	Oh!
30247400	30249400	Oh!
30249400	30251400	So you never actually hurt Pandora, either way?
30254400	30256400	Path of Goliath?
30256400	30258400	Hydration check.
30258400	30260400	My voice is dying.
30260400	30262400	Okay.
30267400	30271400	I hope we can put a stop to Falco with a...
30271400	30273400	Wait, no.
30273400	30275400	I was gonna make a joke and then that's not funny.
30275400	30277400	Because it doesn't work.
30277400	30279400	My joke doesn't work, so I can't make it.
30279400	30281400	Falco's gone nuts.
30281400	30283400	Basically, scenario is planning on using it to take over the plan for himself.
30283400	30285400	Lightly, scenario, world ending.
30286400	30289400	Dude, I was gonna make a Falcon Punch joke.
30290400	30296400	I'm gonna be like, oh, I'm gonna Falcon Punch if I just don't want him.
30296400	30299400	Tell him, okay, alright, okay.
30299400	30301400	Oh, we need to stop Falcon.
30301400	30304400	Maybe we'll give him a Falcon Punch.
30307400	30309400	Oh, sorry, sorry guys.
30309400	30311400	Sorry.
30311400	30313400	You want crickets on that one instead?
30317400	30319400	Sorry about that.
30319400	30321400	Please!
30321400	30324400	Well, this map looks more forgiven for one rate away,
30324400	30327400	because my goodness, that last one was just in the nightmare.
30327400	30332400	I have access to mechs in this map, which is curious.
30332400	30335400	They don't always have a lot of crickets.
30335400	30340400	I have access to mechs in this map, which is curious.
30340400	30343400	They don't always have an access to mech.
30343400	30346400	Yeah, tough crowd.
30346400	30350400	Not allowed to go out that way, or...
30350400	30353400	Excuse me, I would like to out, please.
30353400	30356400	Can only go out of the green doors, got it.
30356400	30358400	That one green?
30358400	30361400	Nope, that one's red.
30361400	30366400	Not only one door to go out of, for some odd reason.
30367400	30374400	Give him a Falcon Need to the Moon, first of all.
30374400	30377400	Oh, to the north, sorry.
30377400	30380400	Right, those are from the...
30381400	30384400	I basically just go all the way straight ahead,
30384400	30387400	and I can pick a tree and then come back and get him.
30388400	30393400	Yeah, they're like so much easier like this.
30393400	30395400	Oh my God.
30397400	30400400	Section Challenge Initiated.
30408400	30410400	Oh, there's one...
30410400	30412400	Jumping mech.
30413400	30417400	I don't know if I should get out and pick up these RDS things.
30417400	30420400	You know that, because I actually don't have a second chance.
30420400	30424400	I might against my better judgement, I hope I'm right.
30429400	30434400	At least if I can have one revive, I don't need to panic too much.
30437400	30439400	Just need one revive.
30439400	30442400	Should I camp for it, maybe?
30442400	30444400	Maybe not, maybe not.
30444400	30448400	I still don't have one though, I need one more kill.
30448400	30452400	I'll get out when I find the next one.
30452400	30455400	Oh my God, it's time for three!
30455400	30457400	Okay, what if I go this way?
30457400	30459400	It's still the right path.
30460400	30462400	Okay, what's the path?
30473400	30475400	Alright, run it over.
30477400	30480400	Oh, I need one RDA, one RDA.
30480400	30483400	Two can earn.
30490400	30493400	I'm just glad I'm allowed to bring the mech for once.
30495400	30497400	There's a Warhawk too.
30504400	30506400	Okay, there's one there.
30509400	30515400	But if it's safe to get out, I will pick it up, but...
30519400	30521400	Okay.
30521400	30523400	I'm getting hammered.
30537400	30540400	There, we'll grab this one.
30540400	30542400	Whoa, whoa!
30542400	30544400	This is what I didn't want.
30544400	30547400	Can I get into our camp, please?
30547400	30549400	No, I can't, I'm not allowed to get back in,
30549400	30552400	because I've just gone ahead and destroyed it, lovely jewel blue.
30552400	30556400	I'm going to quickly get this teleport up here,
30556400	30558400	just because...
30558400	30560400	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
30560400	30562400	I'm getting it, I'm getting it.
30562400	30565400	The mech is so fun, just moving down.
30565400	30569400	Just mowing down the Nuffie in the little wild life.
30569400	30571400	That's him.
30571400	30573400	But it's so true, really.
30573400	30575400	Alright, let's try this.
30575400	30579400	Maybe we can get around and not be so annihilated.
30586400	30589400	Oh, lovely, it doesn't even let you pass.
30589400	30591400	Oh, there.
30591400	30593400	A terrible driver.
30593400	30596400	Oh, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
30596400	30600400	We've made it nice and impossible to drive as they always do.
30600400	30602400	Can I even get past that?
30602400	30604400	Okay, Justin no more.
30605400	30607400	Give me a little spank there.
30607400	30609400	I hope they're here.
30609400	30612400	I can, it's green, thank goodness.
30614400	30618400	Let's have to beat this teleport station.
30620400	30625400	And then, we can start the mission location.
30625400	30629400	You're getting bow-inked so hard.
30629400	30631400	I heard good things.
30631400	30633400	I'm Colonel Clark.
30633400	30636400	Our assault is underway on the Navi strongholds.
30636400	30638400	But these guys fight like animals.
30638400	30641400	I need you to go in and get their top of command.
30641400	30644400	Break the morale and turn the tide in our favor.
30644400	30646400	Let's turn the tide.
30646400	30648400	Commander Falco's running on his own.
30648400	30650400	If I don't stop him.
30650400	30652400	You think you're running your own show?
30652400	30654400	That was Falco's mistake.
30654400	30657400	We're trying to stop Falco, but if we don't take out the commander's first,
30657400	30660400	I saw the AMP between the gate and where you are now.
30663400	30664400	A free amp?
30664400	30666400	Oh, sorry, possibly.
30666400	30668400	They spawned it.
30670400	30672400	Is it encouraged from the guy from his first movie?
30672400	30673400	I think so.
30673400	30677400	They seem to have been able to get the likeness of everyone.
30677400	30680400	Like Sigourney Weaver was at the start of it as well.
30680400	30683400	So it seems like when this game was made,
30683400	30686400	they got the rights to do some tricks.
30687400	30690400	The new brass said they were sending me a problem solver.
30690400	30692400	I should have known it was you.
30692400	30694400	How's your day been, Batista?
30694400	30695400	Painful.
30695400	30696400	I got a whole list of them.
30696400	30697400	I don't think I've ever heard that name.
30697400	30698400	Batista.
30698400	30701400	The blues keep sending in their damn birds to turn us back.
30701400	30702400	How can I help?
30702400	30703400	Batista.
30703400	30705400	They ain't moving until their leader comes.
30705400	30707400	Go by the name of Swata.
30707400	30709400	You make Swata go ta ta.
30709400	30711400	And I bet the rest of them will leave us alone.
30711400	30713400	You make Swata go ta ta.
30713400	30715400	I knew you would be.
30718400	30721400	Okay, another boss that you fight.
30721400	30723400	Yippee!
30723400	30724400	Where is he?
30724400	30725400	Um, right.
30725400	30727400	Can I take a car, please?
30727400	30728400	Just to really speed things up.
30728400	30730400	I don't, I have to admit that last map.
30730400	30731400	Absolutely.
30731400	30732400	Oof.
30732400	30733400	That was rough.
30733400	30735400	But this map, like, literally,
30735400	30737400	they're giving you, like, so much stuff.
30737400	30740400	I assume I can glide over the water with this.
30740400	30743400	So I'm just going to automatically break now.
30743400	30745400	Oh, sorry.
30745400	30748400	If they give, literally give me a bit of mobility
30748400	30750400	and make it easy to move around,
30750400	30753400	then it's all good.
30753400	30755400	Is it left or right up here?
30755400	30757400	It's a right.
30758400	30759400	Oops, sorry.
30759400	30760400	That was a rock.
30760400	30761400	I didn't see it.
30761400	30762400	I've not got my glasses on.
30762400	30763400	Tee-hee.
30763400	30765400	Oops, I'm hitting the curb.
30765400	30766400	Tee, just Tee-hee.
30766400	30767400	A little Tee-hee moment.
30767400	30768400	A little Tee-hee moment.
30768400	30769400	Sorry, sorry.
30769400	30770400	I need my lights on.
30770400	30771400	Oh, oh, sorry.
30771400	30773400	Never saw that, my bad.
30773400	30775400	Right, I'm doing a circle, I guess.
30775400	30777400	And I'm going back on the road over here.
30777400	30778400	Oh.
30780400	30782400	Wait, what the heck is the road?
30783400	30784400	Here?
30786400	30787400	Oh, sorry.
30787400	30788400	Oh, right.
30788400	30789400	I'll just see you take a right.
30789400	30791400	Oh, it's a tight, it's a tight left.
30791400	30792400	Sorry.
30792400	30794400	I don't know the difference between my left and right.
30794400	30795400	I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.
30795400	30797400	Got to stick my hand up in order to know what it's what.
30797400	30799400	Right, okay, okay.
30799400	30801400	Let's just speed around down.
30801400	30803400	Yep, let's just do that.
30803400	30806400	And then we just gently can't claim it.
30806400	30808400	Can't claim it.
30808400	30810400	Can't claim it or can't claim it?
30810400	30811400	Bank!
30811400	30814400	Oh, I've got my bus banked by two of them at once.
30814400	30815400	Please don't.
30815400	30817400	Did they know how to claim?
30817400	30818400	Or how?
30818400	30820400	Oh, they've not been coded to claim.
30820400	30821400	I like it.
30821400	30823400	I like it.
30826400	30828400	Oh, it's cool.
30829400	30831400	Cut off his driving moment.
30831400	30832400	Look, I got eight arms.
30832400	30834400	It's hard to like really figure it one.
30834400	30836400	I can try to.
30836400	30838400	I'm claiming very high.
30841400	30844400	Final boss question mark, maybe?
30844400	30846400	Whoa, why is he?
30852400	30853400	Oh.
30859400	30862400	They are responsible for your Falco's madness.
30862400	30866400	You can stop Falco and you can help people.
30866400	30868400	Wait, am I allowed to join them?
30868400	30870400	Or am I not to join them?
30873400	30874400	Oh, I don't even have a...
30874400	30876400	Choose a side in this final battle.
30876400	30878400	Wait, what did I do?
30878400	30879400	Freedom of choice.
30879400	30881400	Attempt, good or remain evil.
30881400	30883400	Not join.
30883400	30885400	I'm supposed to be evil.
30885400	30886400	RDA?
30886400	30887400	Hmm.
30889400	30890400	Okay.
30890400	30891400	Wait, what did I do?
30891400	30892400	Did I choose...
30892400	30896400	I want to choose RDA, so I stand in RDA, right?
30898400	30903400	I want to be evil, so I stand in the RDA side.
30903400	30904400	Right?
30905400	30907400	Choose to stay with RDA.
30908400	30910400	He's taking his bow out!
30910400	30911400	He's taking his bow out!
30911400	30914400	Oh my God, I literally just heard the sound effect.
30917400	30918400	Uh...
30918400	30922400	Mate, you're going to have to give me some space, mate.
30922400	30924400	You never tasted lead before.
30924400	30927400	I'm sure you haven't since we humans came here.
30927400	30928400	Oh, fuck.
30928400	30930400	And now I'm eating lead.
30930400	30932400	I'm eating the freaking bow string.
30935400	30936400	Oh!
30938400	30939400	I didn't...
30939400	30940400	Oh!
30940400	30942400	Oh my!
30942400	30945400	While I leave you in the hands of fate.
30946400	30947400	Um...
30947400	30950400	I did not expect that, Lamal.
30951400	30952400	Um...
30952400	30954400	I guess I just go back, please.
30956400	30957400	It...
30957400	30958400	That...
30958400	30960400	Yeah, get move fast, though, honestly.
30960400	30962400	Right, if I go...
30962400	30963400	Wait, how did I even get here?
30963400	30964400	I climbed up.
30964400	30967400	Can I climb down on these, or does it not let you climb down?
30967400	30968400	I don't want to get...
30968400	30970400	Oh no, it does let you climb down.
30970400	30971400	How strange.
30971400	30973400	I remember I touched that rope, another one,
30973400	30976400	and the option never came up.
30979400	30980400	It's still going strong as already.
30980400	30981400	It looks like...
30981400	30982400	What did I miss?
30982400	30983400	Um...
30983400	30986400	You missed the last map, which was horrific,
30986400	30988400	and you should actually be...
30988400	30989400	Am I going the right way?
30989400	30990400	I'm getting so kind of them.
30990400	30992400	You should be really glad you missed it.
30992400	30994400	The map layout was horrific.
30994400	30997400	Like, it was telling you to go like all these different ways,
30997400	30999400	and it was all squiggly wiggly,
30999400	31003400	and super detailed and complete.
31005400	31007400	You scared me!
31007400	31009400	Oh, please drive.
31010400	31013400	Right, just get back on the road
31013400	31016400	and go the path I've already been.
31018400	31020400	Oh, oh, I'm so sorry.
31020400	31022400	I didn't mean to hurt you, little horse.
31024400	31027400	Uh, then take a right or a left.
31027400	31029400	Take a right.
31030400	31031400	And then...
31031400	31032400	Whoa!
31032400	31034400	Oh, I thought it was a cliff.
31035400	31036400	Whoa, camera angle.
31036400	31037400	You could be...
31037400	31039400	I have to admit, the camera angle could be
31039400	31042400	a wee bit more, like, forgiven.
31042400	31044400	It's, like, constantly wanting to, like,
31044400	31046400	drive me into the ground for some reason.
31047400	31049400	Up my way, RDA.
31049400	31051400	Up my way, RDA.
31051400	31053400	Cause you're in my way, RDA.
31053400	31055400	I said you're in my way, RDA.
31055400	31057400	It's up my way, RDA.
31057400	31059400	It's up my way, RDA.
31059400	31061400	It's cinema.
31061400	31063400	Navi jumpscare.
31063400	31066400	After all these struggles getting bullied by the AI,
31066400	31068400	the game felt bad and was just letting me,
31068400	31070400	like, get through it.
31070400	31072400	Seriously, that last map, though.
31072400	31074400	I'll take that one to my grave.
31074400	31076400	We just hate the hanging cliff.
31076400	31078400	Woo-wee!
31087400	31089400	Yeah, you're not gonna wait until the...
31089400	31090400	Yeah.
31090400	31093400	103 field commanders.
31093400	31095400	Okay.
31096400	31098400	And then, surely, the game's over.
31104400	31106400	Mm-hmm.
31109400	31111400	Mm-hmm.
31121400	31123400	Mm-hmm.
31125400	31127400	Alright, we're heading...
31127400	31129400	How far away is it? Oh!
31129400	31131400	Someone was smart enough to go ahead
31131400	31133400	and activate that teleport just in case
31133400	31135400	we were doing a little back and forth.
31135400	31137400	And...
31137400	31139400	We actually need to teleport to it.
31139400	31141400	I am so smart.
31141400	31143400	S-M-A-R-T.
31143400	31145400	I was gonna do the Homer Simpson way.
31145400	31147400	S-M-R-T.
31147400	31149400	I am so smart.
31149400	31151400	Said you're in my way, R-T-A.
31151400	31153400	Oh!
31153400	31155400	Well...
31155400	31157400	You know what? I've literally just spawned here.
31157400	31159400	I'm going to come down, actually.
31159400	31161400	Actually, everyone just pause.
31161400	31163400	I've been reported here, and I'm already getting...
31163400	31165400	enrolled.
31165400	31167400	Oh, so now you're agreeing with me, smart.
31167400	31169400	No, the S-M-R-T.
31169400	31171400	That...
31173400	31175400	Well, let's hope there's not too many...
31175400	31178400	How is there a tree of souls here?
31179400	31181400	Unless, when you swap to the Navi,
31181400	31183400	you get a Navi body?
31183400	31185400	That's what I need.
31187400	31189400	He's on a Thanator!
31189400	31191400	He's on a Thanator!
31199400	31201400	Yeah!
31201400	31203400	I need height advantage.
31203400	31205400	Is there anything I can take height advantage on?
31205400	31207400	There's a f***ing thing going to chase me on my boho!
31209400	31211400	I'm now getting...
31211400	31213400	I'm now getting wrecked by his pals as well.
31213400	31215400	Not cast... I cast protection.
31215400	31217400	I just activated, like, five NPCs
31217400	31219400	to join in!
31225400	31227400	I can't even run out of the way in time.
31229400	31231400	This is insane!
31231400	31233400	This is insane.
31233400	31235400	I don't know what to do.
31235400	31237400	There's, like, literally nothing I can cheese on.
31237400	31239400	Please, can I cheese on this?
31239400	31241400	Oh, please, oh, please let me cheese on this so badly.
31241400	31243400	Please, please.
31243400	31245400	Oh, my God, let me cheese on this so badly.
31245400	31247400	Let me cheese on this so badly.
31247400	31249400	I'm cheesing!
31249400	31251400	I'm cheesing!
31251400	31253400	I'm cheesing so hard right now.
31253400	31255400	I'm not cheesing!
31255400	31257400	I'm not cheesing!
31257400	31259400	I know!
31259400	31261400	Okay, okay, they all got pushed off.
31261400	31263400	They all got pushed off.
31263400	31265400	Oh, my God!
31265400	31267400	Uncheese! Uncheese!
31267400	31269400	Uncheese command! Uncheese command!
31269400	31271400	Uncheese command! Uncheese command!
31271400	31273400	Right now, uncheasing.
31273400	31275400	Uncheasing.
31275400	31277400	Uncheasing.
31277400	31279400	Uncheasing.
31279400	31281400	Uncheasing.
31281400	31283400	You are all going to need to, like,
31283400	31285400	stop with this freaking blasting thing.
31285400	31287400	This is an absolute nightmare.
31287400	31289400	Like, all of them are using...
31289400	31291400	I can't...
31291400	31293400	I can't.
31295400	31297400	I hate to be the
31297400	31299400	uh, oo-oo girl that goes,
31299400	31301400	I literally can't right now!
31301400	31303400	I literally can't right now.
31303400	31305400	I don't even know where the Thanator is.
31305400	31307400	Is the Thanator stuck?
31307400	31309400	I hope I've at least cheesed the Thanator.
31309400	31311400	Are you stuck?
31311400	31313400	Oh, thank the maker!
31313400	31315400	Thank the maker!
31315400	31317400	This is a buggy old 2009 game.
31319400	31321400	He led
31321400	31323400	in puke
31323400	31325400	because, oh, my
31325400	31327400	gosh, this game is so hard.
31327400	31329400	So hard.
31329400	31331400	I heard that. I heard you.
31331400	31333400	I literally just heard you spawning.
31335400	31337400	Oh, yeah, and just heal up. No, it's fine, it's fine.
31337400	31339400	Just heal all your health, it's fine.
31339400	31341400	It doesn't matter.
31341400	31343400	No, it doesn't matter at all.
31343400	31345400	Get out of my face!
31345400	31347400	No! No!
31349400	31351400	All the time!
31351400	31353400	Get out! I'm literally
31353400	31355400	freaking walling on stuff.
31355400	31357400	Go away!
31359400	31361400	Stop healing!
31361400	31363400	Stop healing!
31363400	31365400	Stop!
31367400	31369400	I need to reload like this.
31369400	31371400	Right now.
31371400	31373400	Yeah, hold on. Let me take a breather.
31373400	31375400	I just needed one breather.
31375400	31377400	Literally a second.
31377400	31379400	Formulate a thought!
31381400	31383400	Ah!
31385400	31387400	Ah, the freaking...
31389400	31391400	I'm trying so hard.
31391400	31393400	I literally am trying so hard.
31393400	31395400	This is just...
31395400	31397400	And then there's just small more navi there.
31397400	31399400	They're coming down the hill.
31399400	31401400	No, I'm stuck against something.
31403400	31405400	Oh, please!
31405400	31407400	Please!
31407400	31409400	Oh.
31409400	31411400	I'm...
31411400	31413400	I cast protection.
31415400	31417400	Oh.
31417400	31419400	Oh, and I'm...
31419400	31421400	I don't do that.
31421400	31423400	Don't do that again. That's not funny.
31431400	31433400	I'm going to fucking lose it
31433400	31435400	if I actually die here.
31435400	31437400	Go and just perish!
31437400	31439400	To the elements or something!
31439400	31441400	This is insane!
31441400	31443400	This is...
31443400	31445400	No.
31445400	31447400	Get staggered beyond belief
31447400	31449400	and they don't stagger when they use that ability.
31449400	31451400	And their ability,
31451400	31453400	freaking, is on cooldown.
31453400	31455400	There's no such thing as cooldown to them.
31455400	31457400	They actually don't know what it is.
31457400	31459400	But my cooldown lasts forever!
31459400	31461400	Literally, I can't even cast protection.
31465400	31467400	Oh, and I need to reload at the stupid
31467400	31469400	freaking orange box!
31469400	31471400	And I've got one!
31471400	31473400	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
31475400	31477400	No one's surprised!
31481400	31483400	Freaking spraying!
31483400	31485400	There's literally no more health.
31485400	31487400	And you just do it again!
31487400	31489400	Again with the same move!
31491400	31493400	Oh, this is getting ridiculous, mate.
31493400	31495400	I'm going to just get a rest, honestly.
31495400	31497400	Oh, and you'd repel back to health again
31497400	31499400	because you can't even just 1v
31499400	31501400	fucking 1v!
31501400	31503400	Literally, I'm not being funny, but
31503400	31505400	if these are supposed to be avatars
31505400	31507400	with titanium bones and stuff,
31507400	31509400	and you literally can't 1v 1v
31509400	31511400	without fucking prayer protection on
31511400	31513400	every 2 seconds
31513400	31515400	with that stupid move!
31519400	31521400	Oh, fucking terrible ass game.
31523400	31525400	Just perish!
31525400	31527400	Honestly, stop using these abilities!
31529400	31531400	Oh, my!
31531400	31533400	God, man!
31535400	31537400	Yay, we did it!
31537400	31539400	Let's go!
31539400	31541400	Oh, I'm so glad that's over with.
31541400	31543400	Let's move on to the next one.
31543400	31545400	Yippee!
31545400	31547400	Yeah, and they're already showing me.
31547400	31549400	Alright, we'll teleport.
31549400	31551400	GG, easy.
31551400	31553400	I keep forgetting that I'm not as tall
31553400	31555400	as Navi, so I can't just, like, jump
31555400	31557400	it. Oh, well, I
31557400	31559400	didn't need to go on that, so, sure, whatever.
31559400	31561400	We did it!
31561400	31563400	That was awful.
31563400	31565400	That was awful.
31565400	31567400	You don't even pick
31567400	31569400	the difficulty in this thing.
31569400	31571400	My controller is literally dripping with sweat.
31571400	31573400	I thought you loved having autism.
31573400	31575400	It's such a nice little fun treat on the side, isn't it?
31575400	31577400	Not.
31577400	31579400	Oh, and I get to do one more.
31579400	31581400	The protection prayer made me think
31581400	31583400	this was a runescape stream for a second.
31583400	31585400	Yeah, literally.
31587400	31589400	If I could cast it.
31589400	31591400	Oh.
31595400	31597400	Is there a donation? Did I miss a donation?
31597400	31599400	I think it's working.
31599400	31601400	I don't know. Someone said they couldn't, but then
31601400	31603400	I think a few more donations came
31603400	31605400	after that, so I don't know
31605400	31607400	if it's messing up on
31607400	31609400	Firefox or things are just not happy.
31609400	31611400	Don't worry about it
31611400	31613400	if it's not working.
31615400	31617400	Oh, sorry.
31617400	31619400	I just...
31619400	31621400	I just choked on that.
31621400	31623400	Did you plane?
31623400	31625400	Take a scorpion and report to the
31625400	31627400	last commander.
31629400	31631400	Let's try it.
31635400	31637400	You'll read it later.
31637400	31639400	I just sent one a bit ago.
31639400	31641400	I don't see it.
31641400	31643400	You're not the only one to say
31643400	31645400	that you've sent a thingy, but it's not came
31645400	31647400	through. I don't know why.
31647400	31649400	The last one I see
31649400	31651400	is from TinySpiny.
31651400	31653400	It says I've returned from the job.
31655400	31657400	Wait, did it actually not go through?
31657400	31659400	I don't want you to don't know if it's not
31659400	31661400	showing up, seriously, though.
31661400	31663400	Like, if it's not showing up, don't.
31663400	31665400	Um...
31665400	31667400	What was going on?
31667400	31669400	Where the heck?
31669400	31671400	What were you not supposed to go on?
31671400	31673400	Can I just fly through that?
31673400	31675400	Oh, no, I have to fly through the gap.
31675400	31677400	I can already tell.
31677400	31679400	The last commander
31679400	31681400	sends promising.
31681400	31683400	I f***ing hope so.
31683400	31685400	The RDA said
31685400	31687400	it's been an experience,
31687400	31689400	but I'm not sure
31689400	31691400	it's been one for...
31691400	31693400	Yeah, okay.
31693400	31695400	Yeah, yeah.
31697400	31699400	Let's just break through the rocks, don't mind me.
31699400	31701400	Don't worry, mom's happy to support my local calm fish.
31703400	31705400	I know I wouldn't display though.
31705400	31707400	Where am I going?
31707400	31709400	Just a little to the right.
31709400	31711400	Oh, my goodness, Bolly.
31711400	31713400	Okay, there's the helipad
31713400	31715400	that I'm supposed to land on.
31715400	31717400	Make it nice and easy for me.
31717400	31719400	Oop, oop. A little cheeky crash land in there,
31719400	31721400	don't mind me.
31721400	31723400	Is this not it?
31725400	31727400	Looks like it.
31727400	31729400	At least when it's over, you can see
31729400	31731400	you've finally completed the game.
31731400	31733400	Honestly, it's been fun,
31733400	31735400	but there's a reason my Tism
31735400	31737400	didn't attach on this game too much
31737400	31739400	because there's quite a few things like that.
31739400	31741400	That was killing me.
31741400	31743400	Hey, last one.
31745400	31747400	Oh.
31751400	31753400	The only reason I could even win that
31753400	31755400	last fight is because I managed
31755400	31757400	to cheat that Thanotaur.
31757400	31759400	I can't imagine if I would even get past that
31759400	31761400	if that Thanotaur didn't get caught in the road.
31761400	31763400	I'm sorry.
31763400	31765400	I said that wrong.
31767400	31769400	Oh.
31771400	31773400	Am I allowed to slide to get there?
31773400	31775400	Or is it a mix?
31775400	31777400	If I give a mix, I'll take a mix
31777400	31779400	if it's giving me a mix.
31779400	31781400	Then you can play the domination minigame.
31781400	31783400	I like on the Navi side.
31783400	31785400	I've never played it on this side.
31789400	31791400	Alrighty.
31791400	31793400	If I take a right, then everything
31793400	31795400	shall be alright.
31795400	31797400	Let's hope this last one.
31797400	31799400	Strony, you seem sleepy.
31799400	31801400	I hope you're having fun.
31801400	31803400	Yeah, I'm having fun. I know I sound like
31803400	31805400	that's if I punch.
31805400	31807400	I'm getting spawned
31807400	31809400	by a freaking plant.
31809400	31811400	I'm enjoying it.
31811400	31813400	It's just because I've never played it before
31813400	31815400	and
31815400	31817400	I just did not expect
31817400	31819400	at all how unbelievably hard it was.
31819400	31821400	For example, there's RDA soldiers
31821400	31823400	literally getting
31823400	31825400	messed up by these
31825400	31827400	plants and they're just letting it
31827400	31829400	happen and it's just like
31829400	31831400	I had no idea they would make it
31831400	31833400	so hard if I was going to be...
31833400	31835400	Because the Navi side, honestly, you can just ignore
31835400	31837400	everything, but when you're a wee
31837400	31839400	human, you actually can't ignore
31839400	31841400	everything or else you're like a big doo-doo.
31843400	31845400	I mean, it's not that easy.
31845400	31847400	It really is.
31853400	31855400	I'm hoping I do
31855400	31857400	get a good night's sleep soon because
31857400	31859400	it's really hard to be creative and do
31859400	31861400	ASMR collabs like coming up with scripts
31861400	31863400	when I've literally got like no thoughts
31863400	31865400	of doing ASMR collabs.
31873400	31875400	I'm actually going to
31875400	31877400	pick that up because
31877400	31879400	they're too valuable.
31879400	31881400	Wait, I can't even go up one more.
31883400	31885400	Okay, I need to climb like one foot.
31887400	31889400	RDA side to real
31889400	31891400	sad. I hope you're doing a good night's
31891400	31893400	sleep. Yeah, I'm like
31893400	31895400	I've not had a decent
31895400	31897400	one in quite a while. Oh my
31897400	31899400	god, there's so many of them.
31899400	31901400	Okay, that was good. I like
31901400	31903400	that. I think it's heritage that fast
31903400	31905400	like all the time, that'd be great.
31907400	31909400	Oh, see, when it
31909400	31911400	miss...
31911400	31913400	When it misses, it really
31913400	31915400	bothers me.
31917400	31919400	Oh, I'm just going to biz. I don't know.
31919400	31921400	There's enemies everywhere.
31925400	31927400	Oh, I can hear one right behind me.
31927400	31929400	I'm going to try and claim this before
31929400	31931400	default. Get some rest.
31931400	31933400	I will get some good rest. I don't know
31933400	31935400	what my stream is tomorrow. I can't remember.
31935400	31937400	Is it ASMR?
31939400	31941400	Or is that a small game?
31943400	31945400	I think it goes ASMR
31945400	31947400	sweets.
31947400	31949400	Oh, this is a boss fight.
31949400	31951400	Yeah, I'm already getting ruled. Oh, I'm already
31951400	31953400	getting ruled by boss. Okay,
31953400	31955400	this is what I can't stand.
31955400	31957400	I'm about to go do a boss fight
31957400	31959400	and there's like a billion rub.
31959400	31961400	Nah, nah, come on,
31961400	31963400	mate.
31963400	31965400	Yeah, this is getting
31965400	31967400	ridiculous.
31967400	31969400	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
31969400	31971400	Thank goodness I was picking up my RDA
31971400	31973400	things.
31973400	31975400	Whoa.
31977400	31979400	No, no, you're so dead.
31979400	31981400	Get that.
31981400	31983400	Right, a spell of protection, spell
31983400	31985400	of invincibility, because
31985400	31987400	what the actual
31989400	31991400	bro, you're going to need to let
31991400	31993400	I'm dead
31995400	31997400	I need a breather.
31999400	32001400	I literally need a health breather.
32001400	32003400	The AI can
32003400	32005400	freaking see me.
32005400	32007400	Mm-hmm.
32007400	32009400	Yeah.
32009400	32011400	She literally won't go down
32011400	32013400	because she keeps activating all of her abilities.
32013400	32015400	This is ridiculous.
32019400	32021400	Right, so they're
32023400	32025400	Okay.
32027400	32029400	Bro, you're just stun-locking me.
32031400	32033400	I literally can't get close enough.
32035400	32037400	Yeah, how do you
32037400	32039400	like being fucking stun-locked?
32039400	32041400	Oh, fuck!
32041400	32043400	Just infinite
32043400	32045400	spawn after
32045400	32047400	spot, so get the fucking moab out, honestly.
32047400	32049400	What the
32049400	32051400	fucking is this shit, honestly?
32057400	32059400	Uh, have I activated it?
32059400	32061400	Hello? Stun it?
32065400	32067400	Lovely.
32067400	32069400	Mm, let me analize.
32069400	32071400	That did a sweet fuck all.
32071400	32073400	Right, lovely, lovely.
32073400	32075400	Don't ever show your fucking hideous face again.
32075400	32077400	That was what bloody waste that was.
32077400	32079400	Uh, right, that's the best I got.
32079400	32081400	Berserk.
32081400	32083400	Berserk's literally the best I got.
32083400	32085400	And I get
32085400	32087400	stunned the moment I use it.
32091400	32093400	Bro, I need to put
32093400	32095400	I need to put a little invisible on
32095400	32097400	so I can literally heal in time.
32097400	32099400	Yeah.
32099400	32101400	And get stunned the millisecond.
32105400	32107400	This is why
32107400	32109400	I don't play read games on stream
32109400	32111400	because I literally can't even handle a normal game.
32113400	32115400	Yeah, and then invisible again,
32115400	32117400	so I can't get them the entire time they're shooting at me
32117400	32119400	and then stun, and stun, and stun,
32119400	32121400	and stun, and stun, and stun.
32121400	32123400	Okay, we get it, we get it, we get it, we get it, we get it.
32123400	32125400	Stun. We love a good stun, we'll
32125400	32127400	yep, and then, yep,
32127400	32129400	and then into stun, right, what their ability
32129400	32131400	you literally just used
32131400	32133400	that one so you don't even have a cooldown
32133400	32135400	at all. Oh, and then
32135400	32137400	in comes your buddies, in comes
32137400	32139400	yeah, and then your buddy uses their ability
32139400	32141400	and then I'm a way
32141400	32143400	wasting ammo yet again
32143400	32145400	on not the freaking boss.
32147400	32149400	You're gonna need to get a break,
32149400	32151400	so you're gonna need, again, a straight to ability
32151400	32153400	can't, need to wait, need to wait.
32157400	32159400	Again, straight to ability,
32159400	32161400	fucking infinite buddy.
32161400	32163400	Yep, and then they get, no, oh,
32163400	32165400	a Christmas miracle, I actually got a fucking thing from it.
32169400	32171400	Oh, and your pal's already back.
32171400	32173400	I've not even been away for like a millisecond.
32173400	32175400	I'm gonna have to go into this fucking
32175400	32177400	do this, right, at least I've reloaded,
32177400	32179400	but, yeah,
32179400	32181400	and I'm already getting spanked.
32181400	32183400	I don't even know where the fucking enemy
32183400	32185400	that I'm supposed to be killing is.
32185400	32187400	Oh, and straight to the ability.
32187400	32189400	Oh, classic.
32189400	32191400	Oh, more of your pal's!
32193400	32195400	There's nothing I can do, there's
32195400	32197400	literally nothing I can do other than
32197400	32199400	tick damage, like this is
32199400	32201400	just the tiniest
32201400	32203400	amount of damage that can be dealt
32203400	32205400	at any moment, and it just
32205400	32207400	over and over again!
32209400	32211400	Literally playing this game over and over again.
32211400	32213400	One hit, get nothing more,
32213400	32215400	have to heal, get nothing more.
32215400	32217400	Just fucking
32217400	32219400	perish off, fucking
32219400	32221400	map!
32221400	32223400	Uh, I'm dead, I'm actually dead.
32223400	32225400	I don't have a
32225400	32227400	Enviz, and I don't have a heal.
32231400	32233400	I don't know what you want me to do.
32235400	32237400	Who made this, Ubisoft?
32239400	32241400	How many game di- how many fucking
32241400	32243400	playtesters have you got? Like, one max,
32243400	32245400	maybe? Do you share one for, like, one fucking
32245400	32247400	region? One for whole of Oceanic,
32247400	32249400	one for whole of Bloody Europe, one for whole of
32249400	32251400	fucking America? Like, what's going on?
32251400	32253400	None of you's playtested this, not one person.
32253400	32255400	Not one person!
32257400	32259400	Oh, let me just analyze
32259400	32261400	and see if this is there, this seems fair.
32261400	32263400	Mmm... Right, let's uh, let's do

32281400	32283400	fucking use their abilities, all the fucking thing!

32482040	32485280	It's never fucking end and vote was it vault
32485800	32497800	Volcan thank you for the tip. It's never ending. There is no way that was appropriately play tested unless I'm missing like
32498440	32506600	Some major notes, and I missed a massive patch that came out for this game in 2009 that there's no way
32507160	32511880	That is the gameplay and then the dev team happy with that gameplay
32512560	32513560	I
32513560	32516800	Refused to accept that that even got passed
32519520	32522000	Absolutely refused to accept that I got past I
32524520	32531320	Don't think anyone got this far in the place. I think I completely agree with that statement cuz what on earth was that?
32532960	32537360	Literally, I don't have an ability when I play Navi if I get hit I have a massive fucking throbbing
32537640	32543000	Fucking pulse coming from a bloody groin. No, I don't want to teleport. I want to talk to the man
32543000	32545000	That's right right in there
32546240	32548240	Please let it be over
32554200	32556200	Let it be over
32556800	32558800	Let it be over. Yeah, I'm not

32567400	32569400	Yeah, that Moab did absolutely

32573040	32577800	Let it be over. Let it be over. Let it be over. Let it be over. Let it be over. Let it be over. Let it be over
32579960	32581960	Thanks for borrowing a condom
32585960	32591880	This game was pretty bad pretty fast after lunch. Thanks to the game getting canned hard in the reviews and took their money around
32591880	32596240	I mean they made them if they got two points living million sales. Yeah
32597600	32599600	So don't screw up
32599880	32603280	Yes, sir. Thank you. You can kiss over there
32604160	32610600	You so much you put a scratch there there last at least the section span over you mean that wasn't the last section
32610600	32613000	Are you implying there's more to this fucking thing?
32613440	32616600	Or just ordered you to board a dragon to fly to some location
32617480	32620800	This is why mommy likes me hold her hand. Yes. This is why I like
32621800	32623800	This is awful
32625520	32630520	You're still streaming. Oh, you just missed the part where I screamed down the make so yeah, oh
32634600	32636600	Please let me go off this road
32637040	32643820	Why does the conductor keep putting me on? Well, I did they keep creating more and more sections of this fucking site of the map
32644660	32653580	Okay, this is it. This is it the map looks like this is it. There's nothing more of the matter
32657740	32663180	Well, we all pretended that you finished the game and you can go risk. No, this is it
32663780	32669240	Look at the map. There's no way this map is a fetch quest because look at the state of it. There's not an owner. Oh
32669520	32671520	Oh
32671800	32673800	Did I get to drive this at least?
32675320	32677320	It's over
32680640	32683640	Oh, how do I fly this? Oh fuck me, man. Oh
32685920	32688620	No, oh no, I don't like that. Oh, no
32691520	32698000	Right, okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, huh. Oh, yeah, I can fly I can fly
32699560	32703280	Call me Peter Pan because you can fly you can fly you can fly
32706080	32709520	Okay, take it easy easy on the corners easy
32710640	32717260	Pandora is a little wild for the road bumps and by road bumps the full mass of us
32721000	32723000	You can shoot the rocks
32723000	32725000	Oh
32727840	32729840	That makes them
32731920	32733920	Wait, I'm gonna run out of missiles
32738040	32740040	Okay
32742040	32747680	That was a very successful drive, I think I don't think I actually bumped into one thing
32749840	32751840	Easy easy
32753000	32755000	Oh
32755040	32756040	actual
32756040	32758040	Best landing ever
32760640	32764720	Okay, there are wolves, but that's fine. Nothing I can't handle. Oh
32766440	32769880	I can't do my little flip in the water. Do a flip
32772280	32774280	What kind of sadistic
32775000	32778000	Made to say you should be able to run out of missiles
32778000	32785680	Honestly, it does seem a bit like that flight thing that flying dragon is massive and you're telling me they can't hold more than like 20 muscles. Oh
32787480	32794520	Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Why are you holding that piece of paper? Oh, oh
32794520	32796520	Oh
32806400	32808400	What's the plan
32815640	32818000	I'm gonna I'm gonna put down TNT
32819000	32827000	As long as there's no boss fight, I couldn't be less of a rat's horse what fetch quest you send me on name your boss fights
32828320	32831360	What is this? What is this armor?
32833480	32837240	Protection down but everything else up. I think I'd rather protection up
32839080	32841080	Just leave it leave it
32841600	32843600	What's this right? What's the deal?
32843960	32845960	Oh
32847960	32852240	As long as there's no boss fight on the other side, I couldn't give a rise of a rat's
32857640	32861520	I'm not keep tolerating any anymore
32863920	32868360	If the goal was to make the count in pain memorable, they should be sure succeeded
32868360	32870840	Oh, I'd say more like miserable because
32871760	32876640	Again, like literally the Navi instantly do that as soon as you injure them. They do their thing
32878440	32880440	Except that one I guess
32881920	32885640	Let's just let's navigate we're appropriate
32888960	32890960	I don't know if I should just speedrun it
32892480	32897320	Can the mech even go on the bridge that's up ahead it feels like a bridge on my hood and my wee minimap
32899200	32901200	Oh
32902520	32908760	Like this game parish definitely, yeah, thanks for that really appreciate that
32911280	32915680	Why am I being shot I'm being chased I'm being chased
32915680	32917680	Oh
32922320	32927680	Yeah, definitely happy to replay that's true brotherhood not happy to replay
32930800	32934960	The Navi say yay fun the RDA say oh my god
32936880	32942960	I think I've almost got two revives, but I don't think I have a boss fight anymore. I think this is literally just
32943600	32945600	Spring pray from here on out
32956160	32958160	Accuracy rubbish. Oh
32966560	32971400	Oh, that's a lot of Navi and they're probably gonna destroy my myth. Oh, I'm not careful
32973200	32975200	Where's BT when you need them
32989360	32993600	I just want a few revives on hand. All right, I've got two revives now
32994760	32998360	As long as I can choose a hate thing if there's a fight ahead. I
32998840	33000840	Just hope this. Oh my god my mix
33001760	33003760	Well, look at me
33008720	33015320	Right just got keep going just looks like there's fates all the way up ahead. We need BT on
33017640	33022320	Honestly sorry for reason idea of RDA, but thank you for experience in it
33023200	33028600	Thank you for experiencing the pain. I mean some people enjoy when streamers rage. I don't know
33031160	33036560	I got taken out in viz for that like some people genuinely love when streamers rage and I'm like
33038160	33044160	Hold off the Navi. No, you are not gonna make them literally
33049080	33055280	Um, I don't know how freaking strong you think I am I am not that good. I that's
33056240	33060320	Okay, I'm gonna try and keep a lid on it and not get overwhelmed
33060840	33064440	Very quickly. I am so glad I picked up the other RDA
33068640	33070640	I can't do anything
33078160	33080160	Yeah, I'm gonna need you guys
33084040	33089480	Hmm, I'm gonna need everyone to start spamming nades everywhere. I'm pretty sure those are RDA needs
33089480	33093080	I'm gonna need everyone to do that unanimously unanimously right now
33095120	33097920	It's not it's okay. Just sacrifice me in the fire
33100560	33106040	Oh, and I'm taking out in viz, which is the only time it helps to we do my
33109560	33111560	Uh-huh
33112160	33117240	Okay, feel and then damage protection to how I can get my heel back up
33119600	33121600	I need long range
33127440	33132400	Okay, those are definitely our needs I feel like if the Navi were doing needs like that, I'd be a goner already
33133680	33136360	Okay, okay, we're not over run
33140480	33147080	But don't want to jinx it but I'm gonna grab that it's really important
33149480	33153960	I'm gonna jinx it but it's looking good only a minute 30 of this and then we're done
33159600	33161600	Okay
33162360	33165120	But protection on I don't really want to miss me too much
33171040	33173040	I'll take that
33173800	33175800	I'm cool. I'm
33176800	33180480	Okay, I don't know if we're spamming needs, but keep doing that shit. Oh my god
33181120	33185560	It's literally stun off in them from hitting us. Oh, that's a lot. That's a lot. Hold on
33189200	33191200	Oh dear
33191600	33197160	I think I think maybe some of our soldiers went down because we're getting now. Okay. Now we're over run again
33199840	33205160	If I can just whittle down some base health on them, it just makes all the world of difference
33206440	33208440	Oh
33213960	33217560	We may actually have three roses. Oh, I'm getting some of my pardon
33219520	33226320	I'm not that mad because I'm actually getting help like genuinely getting help and like they're not all all off and on to me
33226320	33230120	It's when they all all off and there's like nothing I can do hold on. Sorry. I'm getting
33230440	33232320	Because I'm too busy
33232320	33236360	Praising the game for not being absolutely ridiculous. Oh, I take it back
33244000	33248880	Why do you fill out your pistols every time why do you insist on fill it out the pistol?
33249760	33252120	Well, I hope it didn't die because of that freaking cutscene
33254040	33259560	Is mercy up by the way, I think mercy may be live. I may have completely missed it
33262320	33264320	Oh
33264320	33266320	Oh
33266320	33268320	Oh

33316000	33318000	Wow
33318000	33323240	Mercy's region just yeah, if you're in it, I don't know you'll need to see who rage is more me or mercy. Oh

33345960	33350640	One read stream to the next return to your dragon flight the well souls. We've done it
33351640	33358800	The evil has been defeated. I will never I'm very happy to say I will never play the RDA side again. Oh
33360280	33362280	A rank rotten experience

33378360	33381160	Forward a little to the right
33384720	33390720	The game arrangement real I was just it was just rinse and repeat rinse and repeat in the moment
33390720	33396360	I've got even a hint of damage a lick of damage to speed things up
33396920	33399560	Either new guys were brought in
33403480	33405480	Oh
33408760	33410760	It's actually have a health bar just
33413760	33415920	Taking these corners to Willy-nilly then
33419000	33423840	Story show on your back. I can't help it. I know how it when you're angry. Oh my god. I feel like that would be terrifying
33423840	33425840	I
33429480	33433760	Make me in that peaky shrivel and go back and save me. I'm so happy terrible
33434600	33436600	That follows on the receiving end of that
33439720	33442320	Same here is kind of what no
33444280	33446280	Sorry, sorry
33446520	33448520	I
33452760	33457720	Right we did it we have confirmed the evil
33459200	33463280	Is the game gonna let us get there without being attacked by a plan
33467400	33474080	No fighting here, or I'm gonna cry I'm gonna angry spot is more. I'm sorry so that terrifies mummy
33476800	33478800	Oh
33490360	33492440	Oh, I'm going
33494280	33495720	Listen to you
33495720	33500280	The new recruits fresh from earth. I've been working on this for over 10 years
33500280	33503560	This is my moment right now. So if it doesn't work
33504360	33508400	I'll see you on the other side. Oh wait, I have to I need to end him anyway. Oh
33514240	33518200	Well, this is gonna be beautifully satisfying
33521400	33525600	Just let me cook a bit. Okay, it's fine. He has ability to go out of but yeah
33527000	33531800	All things considered actually, you know what I could probably put on that double aggression thing
33533560	33535560	Reserve her. Yeah
33538600	33540600	Okay, oh
33542120	33544120	We healed up
33545360	33549360	I'm not sure I can send it to you healing up. So don't do that again
33553560	33555560	Okay, I kind of like some walking around
33556520	33562960	He doesn't really seem to do anything it seems like he
33579840	33583600	I'm just giving him it I'm just throwing everything I'm hold on a minute
33586440	33591720	Oh, wow, so the sonic pulse is too far away none. Okay, he's still healed again
33594560	33599400	Now sadly, I am going to run out of ammo doing this message
33600360	33603080	So not really sure
33607960	33612360	That's fine you're like to do that, but maybe don't heal again
33615560	33617560	Um
33622040	33624200	Am I supposed to do something special for this fight?
33630760	33637240	I don't know when he'll get we get like five and then the game's like, okay, no more heals for you. Well, why did the aim do it?
33637480	33639480	I
33645160	33651960	Like a ammo station, there was one back there. I'm literally out
33667320	33669320	Oh
33673400	33678440	I'm not like mad at this fight or anything, but like bro you keep healing like there's nothing I can do
33690760	33692760	Use my mortar strike on him
33692760	33694760	Yeah
33701640	33703640	Uh
33708280	33710280	I did nothing to him
33710840	33712840	Oh
33719720	33721240	I'm a bit confused
33721240	33726760	Sorry, I need to change out my weapons because they're all empty. So I can't the nail gun sure
33728200	33731640	It's already full me and there's no point me getting flamethrowers or
33734040	33736040	Um machine gun
33736360	33739320	I don't know I can I can oh this one's different
33744120	33746120	Okay, nail gun again
33747400	33749400	I healed again
33751480	33754920	I don't know if I'm supposed to call upon awa to do something
33757720	33761560	The utility looks like I've left literally sneaking on I guess he's just a damage on
33762680	33764680	Wait, just go to the glowing thing
33765400	33767400	I think back here
33767800	33769800	No
33774040	33776040	Sorry, I'm brain

33780120	33781960	I'm looking
33781960	33786280	But yeah, I'm starting to think I'm needing to like call upon awa to like end him because
33787080	33792760	I'm literally like swimming right now. Excuse me. I just wanted to go for a wee swim before I ended you
33794760	33797000	I'm just going to go like up on awa. Oops. Sorry. I'm gonna drop
33799080	33801080	Glowing
33802120	33806680	Not here. No, I'm definitely not to climb awa right now glowing
33811800	33815400	I thought that stick I mean that stick is glowing what the fuck it is
33816120	33818120	I
33822280	33827240	Morning de synchronization imminent honestly, can you bring him to the ledge?
33831240	33833400	I feel like I'm supposed to do something here
33839320	33842520	I think it's broke. Okay, so I watched a quick video and the guy
33843480	33847400	Eases a green angel. Oh greening greening launcher. Okay
33850520	33855080	Is this a grenade launcher? I only have 20 on the grenade
33858520	33860520	Oh
33861640	33867720	Oh, wow, really? Okay after all of that, bro
33867880	33874920	I'm starting to think this shit wasn't playtested at all past this point
33894120	33896120	Are we the baddies?
33898520	33900520	Oh
33907240	33909240	Yeah, let's see where the baddies all right
33912920	33914920	Rider you there colonel quarch
33915400	33919960	Panelists is going like a baseball stadium. What the hell did you do? I'm not sure
33920200	33926520	Whatever you did it worked the navi are making a quick retreat. I'm getting reports. They lost control of their band sheets
33926760	33928760	That makes sense to you. Yeah
33928840	33930200	It actually does
33930200	33932600	Congrats rider. You're gonna be a hero for this
33933240	33937800	I'll get your butt down here and that dragon better be spotless. You had damage on the dragon
33938920	33940920	Eat
33941240	33944920	I heard we lost Kendra, but you need to know you did the right thing
33945640	33947640	I hope it was all right
33947960	33951080	This better bring peace. You've stopped a catastrophe, but this isn't over
33951720	33956440	We can't keep control available for long nor should we and we've got more shit
33956600	33958600	of humans do to arrive
33958920	33961240	More is inevitable. So what was this all for?
33961880	33966440	A we needed to see what we're taking over. Not there being part two spoilers from the movie in the video game
33966840	33968840	Next time she'll be ready
33970920	33972920	Am I here?
33976600	33979960	Development team should be ashamed of yourself for the rda side
33980520	33985960	Development team should be proud of yourselves from the navi side. Don't ever make me do that again. That's awful
33987480	33989480	Oh my god
33990920	33994280	I have no idea how hard I reached because I can't remember in the moment
33995240	33997240	But oh my god
33998760	34001480	Am I going mental or was that terrible?
34003560	34008760	I think I must have I think I should have been using the grenade launcher clearly from that last fight
34009320	34012040	And and because I didn't use the grenade launcher
34013160	34014840	and
34014920	34017720	It just got from like bad to worse or
34018440	34023160	You blacked out when you raised. I don't remember really what I just remember like I did get angry
34023800	34026360	But I don't remember anything that actually happened like
34026840	34032920	One minute I was like getting annoyed and then the next minute the fight was over and I got stuck on a rock and I was trying to get down
34035960	34040200	I think grenade launcher is op. Okay, I guess that's probably you're showing quite a bit
34041000	34043000	I'm cheeky gang bang
34043400	34049960	She literally saw red. Honestly. It was beautiful. Monka is you're rage is hot, but the mission was bad
34051720	34057720	Angry girl, you were fuming at the man. I was frothing for a moment. I clipped it. So show up one stream and it's Monka
34057720	34062280	I don't even know am I going to be embarrassed if I look back on it like I don't feel that bad right now
34062360	34064360	So kind of been that bad
34065320	34071080	The game got dunked on hard and forgotten pretty quickly, but for the general community for a lot of good reasons
34073400	34077960	At least you finished it. You deserve a good rest. Good girl. I'm proud of you for not giving up
34078360	34085080	The rage has talked to your content. Well, that is literally why I do not play rage games like mercies unironically so brave
34085720	34089320	For playing that game. Like I couldn't I'd just be scurriman
34090280	34095960	It may be a bit embarrassing, but at least it seems to have been for a good reason. I felt that rage. It's so funny
34096680	34100760	Also, you might want to make more tea before sleeping or after waking up or for my voice
34101960	34106760	I mean, it felt like a justifiable rage or he just won't make us class. The rage was justified. Okay
34107320	34109320	Congrats. You did good job thing
34110040	34114040	So now you need more than an app. You may need to fill it. Oh, I hope I can get like a full eight hours
34114040	34116040	I've been needing it for a while
34117000	34120440	You didn't give up. So you did a good job at least. Heck yeah
34121880	34128360	Mad cause bad. Lamar true. Literally all I had to do was pull out the grenade launcher
34129480	34131480	apparently
34131880	34133560	Lucky me
34133560	34135560	Lucky me. All I had to do was pull out
34136920	34138920	Take these head pads
34139480	34141480	I would have went insane. You're amazing
34142200	34147720	Well, then I feel like you guys probably would have figured out to swap to the weapon way before I did so
34148520	34152200	Sending hugs if they're welcome. Otherwise you did so good. I'll take those hugs
34153240	34155960	Are you the first person to finish this campaign on stream?
34156520	34160600	Stop imagine if I was like the first vtuber to play this game. That would be hilarious
34161400	34167880	And and the pov is like isn't the navi side amazing and then the rd side is me just screaming
34167880	34173240	Sorry for forcing you to play that. I feel bad now. Nah, come on. I can stop at any time
34175000	34177720	I just say stilettos and then I would stop don't worry
34178680	34184120	If you're the first that counts as a world record, I would have thrown my monitor before changing weapons
34184760	34186760	making vtuber history
34186760	34192520	Oh, so when an angry scot rages. Oh, so wins the angry scotch rages somewhere, honestly
34193400	34202280	I'm pretty sure you are though. Oh, no, I'm what sorry. I've already I've already forgotten what I'm probably would overgrinding did
34203480	34208600	Before and killed it with a bigger number. You're probably the only one that ever will you can be the avatar vtuber
34210040	34212520	The way of the water the way of the scot
34214040	34216200	You did great powering through that heck. Yeah
34216760	34219960	Think about it. You used the worst weapon to beat the game. Honestly
34220760	34224520	I actually think you are the first vtuber to do on straight vtuber history
34224600	34227640	Not even a weekend after debut. I'm already making history
34228120	34233720	But see fully the rda was a lot more fun than the navi. Why because of the rage apparently everyone's got
34233960	34237000	You know half masked at the moment because they liked my rage
34238440	34241800	The way of the scot the cut fish the way school and
34242840	34247000	You have a full monopoly on this game now. Okay. Okay. I'll take it. I'll take it
34247960	34251160	I'm the type to pause the game and watch a video spin feeding me on what to do
34251480	34255000	Honestly small streamer did two years ago, but for both campaigns. Yes
34256280	34258280	half half
34258440	34262760	Now I'm going to get the game to relieve or to relive the pain
34263560	34265560	You can't me
34266440	34271480	Yeah, let's say half only half wait, there's no way I need to make a rage ASMR if that's okay
34272360	34274360	I don't mean suffering like that
34274680	34278520	Like honestly, I feel fine now, but I guess in the moment. I was like scary region
34280040	34283080	Sorry if I scared anyone. I apologize
34284680	34288040	Got some ancestral rage built up in me, I guess
34291800	34294760	Me just skipping 60 percent past all the enemies honestly
34295560	34299480	60 percent probably like 100 percent of the optional fights I skipped like I'm not even kidding
34299800	34301800	Now you scare us more. No, you didn't scare
34303480	34306360	You could do it more. You're like, well, I do have a
34307880	34311720	Donut lawn reward potentially being that rage, but yeah
34312920	34317720	Stormy rage air should be like you call that. Oh, I willy. That's just prophetic, you know
34320840	34325320	That was uh, that wasn't scary. It was the opposite. Oh the fabled scotch rage
34325640	34331080	I mean, I was scared and felt something else at the same time. I'm not gonna explain. That's actually hilarious
34331640	34335720	I didn't know that had that effect. It makes me remember the banshee scream. Oh
34337320	34342280	I'm not sure I can even banshee scream like I can do it like my screams very loud
34342360	34346040	But I'm not gonna scream because I I think after the rage
34346440	34351240	I don't know if one of the neighbors are probably trying to listen in on me right now and be like what is going on
34352840	34354840	Angry hypnosis ASMR
34355000	34359560	Get hypnotized. Get hypnotized. Get hypnotized. I still prefer subspace
34362440	34364440	Just yelling get up
34367080	34373160	Right, um, they're gonna call the police on you. I've actually wondered if it's a possibility
34373720	34377480	I did speak to my neighbors at one point
34378600	34381560	And I explained to them that I'm a voice actress
34382200	34386440	So if they hear anything at night, don't be too worried. It's just me
34389560	34392440	So my voice acting's a bit different
34393640	34399080	Um, can you make a reward that you just scream scottland forever scottland forever
34399720	34404840	Passive aggressive ASMR. They're like, is she okay in there? Does she need help?
34406280	34409560	If someone clip that moment the clip will give but we'll get pretty
34411800	34414840	Oh the toothbrushing I'm gonna go get my toothbrush. Okay
34416280	34419480	I'll be right back. We're gonna if you want to get your toothbrush and brush your teeth
34441560	34443560	I
34461320	34463560	Got one out of 21 days to brush our teeth
34464760	34466920	Wait, let me put my headset on so I can listen to the
34467560	34472840	Thingy right. I got my toothbrush. It could be a sound pack from morning alarms. Just full bag pouch
34475320	34478520	I have toothpaste because I salivate a lot. I don't know about you
34478520	34481720	But whenever something enters my mouth, it starts to salivate like crazy
34481880	34484280	We're gonna brush our teeth and then we'll read into
34485560	34489400	Yeah, mercy. I was gonna call her mousy for a second. What's she eating a mouse?
34490840	34492840	Are you ready?

34495320	34496680	With me
34496680	34499800	I'm gonna do it for two minutes. Okay. That's how long you brush your teeth
34499880	34502600	So just start with the front of your teeth, right?
34503320	34507720	I see you. I do you want me to mute the game so you can like really hear the brushy brush
34509320	34511320	Yeah
34511720	34517080	I don't think you're gonna hear it over the thing. No, I will start a two minute counter now
34518520	34520040	Uh
34520040	34522040	Oh, yeah, sorry. Let me mute the game
34523000	34527160	I was probably gonna break now that I'm out and it's tabbed out of the game. There we go
34528280	34530920	Do you have a chanting? I do have chanting. Hold on
34532120	34535960	Uh, whoa, that's a lot of words to speed up one. Hold on

34603320	34605560	Does that have a pillow in this room? I don't
34606680	34609000	I have so much saliva coming out of my mouth
34613160	34616760	Do the back of your front teeth and the back of your front bottom teeth

34838600	34840760	I said what everyone was thinking and said
34842120	34845400	But uh, yeah that game needs a hot patch for a weapon drill. So I'm saying
34847240	34851400	It won't let me open the redirect thing. Why not?
34853240	34857800	YouTube you're so stinky sometimes it won't let me load so I can redirect into mercy
34857880	34860440	I need to wait for it to load. Okay. I did it now

34920680	34925000	You did so well you make me so proud
34927560	34932840	Such long unending stamina for me
34934840	34936840	Did it work?
34939480	34942680	Did it work? Did I have a reverb effect when I did that?
34942840	34945320	I don't know if that worked or not or did I mess it up?
34947400	34950200	What do you mean looking at school? You're the crazy one who took bail
34950840	34955400	So if I'm feeling like it is yeah, the reverb was like yes, I work. I'm so happy
34957240	34960600	If my voice wasn't so burst I'd do a bit more but it's burst right now
34961800	34963800	Big burst big burst
34966280	34968280	All hail the glowfish
34969000	34975240	It looks good when my like eyes and my little shells you can kind of see the transparency of my shells a bit by our like this
34976440	34977960	Maybe
34977960	34979960	You can see my reflectives
34979960	34981960	thing going on
34982200	34984200	It works though
34984360	34985720	Wait talk a bit
34985720	34991960	Okay, I'm glad it worked. Right. I am going to end it there without a fantastic endurance room
34992200	34997640	Tomorrow is old school runescape. So just so you know the plan the plan is
34998440	34999800	that
34999800	35004440	We what I'm going to make a new fresh account. You don't have to
35005400	35006360	but
35006360	35011560	My idea was that we do some questing to level up and then we basically
35012120	35016520	Just have fun leveling up cooking and see what where it goes
35017240	35019000	um
35019000	35021000	But I'm a bit rubbish at like
35022280	35026120	Quest so it would be nice to try them together like cooks assistant. Um
35027080	35032520	I'm sure there's like a vam that haunted house quest. I can't remember its name right now
35033000	35035560	But we're going to do like those kind of questings
35036360	35038280	and then
35038280	35042520	We can do some fishing together and we'll cook the fish
35043160	35047000	outside of the barbarian village because that's free
35047960	35049240	um
35049240	35052600	And we can cook crayfish for free. I'm pretty sure you just need to get in it
35053400	35057640	Are you doing members? I think so. That's my only issue
35057720	35062120	I'm gonna buy membership, but I'll play like I'll go into a free-to-play lobby
35062440	35065800	And we can do the free-to-play quests and take it from there
35066680	35071800	Because I'm not entirely sure what the plan is after that
35073240	35075240	I joined you on old school
35075800	35077800	uh runescape sheebie
35078760	35080760	I hate to break it to you. My name's Trony
35081000	35083000	I
35084520	35086520	Tags level dream hypnosis
35087320	35089820	Uh, yes runescape membership
35090600	35096440	Time to make my account tonight too. He yes, I'll share whatever we're on and we can all go questing together
35096680	35100840	We can see all the reefling gang gang. I'm tired. It's fine. I know. I know what you meant
35100920	35105080	I need to go sleep. The fangs are so much easier to admire this course. Yeah
35105800	35107800	Yeah
35108120	35114520	Some people thought they were vampire fangs, but they're not that's jack. You can't really see my ears, but they're slightly pointed
35115080	35117080	No pointy
35118360	35122600	I haven't played in ages. I need to learn. Yeah, we can all get like the same level we can all like
35123160	35127560	Hack the same u-tree when we're trying to level up her uh woodcraft
35128440	35131080	Are you planning on playing something at follow 76?
35131880	35135320	I think that's multiplayer, but I don't know how to get you in my lobby
35135560	35140440	Like how do I get reeflings in lobby or is it like can we make a lobby code?
35140760	35142760	And it's like a server like they host
35143400	35145400	I'm not sure how 76 works
35146520	35148840	Get bit by the fish you want to buy
35150840	35153400	Would you let me bite you reefling?
35154280	35156280	That's terrible
35157400	35159400	You should let me do it
35160360	35163480	I love your choice of games so far makes me safe to see what else you got play
35165080	35169880	Well, I'm glad you like the game so far. I'm literally just picking childhood stuff and stuff that makes me happy
35170920	35172920	So I'm glad
35172920	35175240	But yes old-school RuneScape definitely
35175960	35178120	might be a reoccurring multiplayer for a little bit
35178680	35180280	um
35180280	35181560	I'm not really gonna
35181560	35185880	I'm not sure what happens when membership what membership streams are planned
35186680	35188680	I think we'll also do
35188840	35191960	I think three membership streams a week possibly
35193480	35199000	One for react movie one for membership
35201160	35205720	Multiplayer I'll decide like I wouldn't do like progression
35206600	35208920	on old-school RuneScape multiplayer
35209720	35212680	Behind a membership stream because that's not fair for those invested
35213400	35215400	So maybe
35216200	35218200	Maybe maybe um
35219640	35227400	I first I first played again yesterday for the first time used old-school RuneScape and a goblin got you
35227400	35231480	You got done at goblin village a dead by daylight member stream. Yeah
35232600	35238600	I'm open to these kind of things, but yeah one I want to consistently have a member stream
35241160	35243160	When memberships open
35244120	35245160	Uh
35245160	35250520	I react and they like we'll watch a movie together and then I might also do a script writing
35251400	35252520	Scream
35252520	35256200	Or maybe show you some behind the scenes stuff like maybe we write shorts
35256280	35257000	I don't know
35257000	35262520	I'm trying to think of like stuff you guys want to see and then of course we could just like maybe smaller games that aren't
35263080	35265400	Necessarily stream worthy on main
35265880	35270280	So for those of you who are unable to membership, please don't worry
35270760	35274280	I always have free content coming out and I
35275160	35279080	For days like so, you know how we played needy streamer overload yesterday
35279640	35282520	Because that was only two hours long like that's a short game
35283000	35288120	I would then come back online after maybe like a 30 minute rest and then do a membership stream
35288360	35292520	So you still get like content that day and then like I'll raid into whoever's online
35293240	35294600	um
35294600	35299160	And like keep going so yeah, don't worry. She streams eight days a week
35300120	35306920	Yeah, don't ever worry and like obviously the ace mark comes out as well. That's like free on youtube. You can watch on youtube anytime
35307960	35309560	and
35309560	35315000	Script writing stream or submit scripts. Yes, it would be a bit hard to review
35316120	35318920	Scripts live because I would need to use euphemism
35320680	35325480	That's nice as long as you're not overworking yourself. I will make what I can handle and
35326360	35328360	We can take it from there
35328760	35330760	Yeah
35330920	35332920	Get that Hermione to
35333240	35336600	Rewind time and overlap herself streaming honestly
35337960	35339960	True true
35340920	35345480	I'll need to see eventually be able to close your eyes and see her for a moment. You don't watch
35347240	35349240	Always online
35350040	35353960	There are always rooms so yes, please never worry if you don't have the money for membership
35354200	35357720	Because I stream every day and you can come see me every day. Um
35358760	35359800	and
35359800	35367640	Yeah, I'll make sure everyone gets their money's worth either way because I don't like when streamers don't get their money's worth
35368600	35374120	All right, sorry. I don't I don't like when streamers don't get their money's worth. That's just me. So yeah, um
35375400	35382920	Strony's a stream and beast. I'm sure she'll have something for you. Yeah, I've got something for everyone or that's the plan anyway
35383160	35385160	Hopefully I got something for everyone
35386120	35394120	So you're saying is I should never become a member only if you are financially capable and
35394920	35402040	If you're only financially capable to support one person, I recommend doing my daughters over me. Okay
35403480	35407480	Um because I always have free accessible content
35408120	35410200	a always coming out so yeah
35411000	35414360	Yeah, we love you strong. Please don't try my blood. Yes
35416520	35419000	You're such a good girl. It's insane. Yeah
35423320	35428280	I will skip meals to members. Stop. No, we're not doing these jokes. I don't actually don't like these
35429240	35433320	There was like one joke that was like, oh, I'm I'm like in a homeless shelter
35433640	35435880	And then I've given you like membership or whatever. I don't know
35436600	35443000	It's actually probably one I am like so goofy and non-series all the time. Those kind of jokes are like
35444920	35446920	I don't like them
35448040	35450040	I sold my kidney. Yes. I was like
35450600	35452600	No, I don't like
35452600	35457720	You definitely have a few streams that I need to rewatch. I love it though. Oh, they're long streams
35458120	35463240	You'll be rewatching for a while, but I'm good for putting on in the background for a rambling if you ever like
35463880	35467800	I need I want to listen to something in the background, but I don't want to actually focus in
35468280	35473720	Yeah, just put the avatar stream on and then when it comes to the rda part when I start screaming my head off
35474200	35475240	my
35475240	35477240	my scarier, but
35477800	35482360	I'm looking forward to your first ace round stream. Hope youtube doesn't do anything. Um, I'm a bit worried
35482360	35488280	But I'm not going to be doing earlicking or anything like that. I don't know what the heck youtube's been playing at recently
35488280	35490280	It's making me nervous to even upload my like
35491160	35495480	1,000 rewards and there's literally nothing wrong with that freaking audios
35496680	35500840	Well, I just made a brand new school roadscape. It's been years and I look forward to it. Yay
35501560	35504520	I will tell everyone the server when we get on tomorrow
35504600	35507400	Like I'll put it on screen and I'll say like this is the world that we're in
35507880	35516840	Um, and we'll start outside Lumbridge castle where the starting point is. Um, I'm literally gonna make an account put membership on it and then
35517800	35523480	I get online for stream and we'll take it from there. I don't know what to name myself. So I need to name myself something
35524040	35530760	Mildly humorous, but I haven't decided yet. Maybe skullfish. That'd be nice. Oh, no someone someone. Ah, well, if you take my name
35530760	35533160	It's fine. I don't know. I'll need to think of something
35534600	35536600	Do you have a place where you'll upload?
35538280	35540280	Money's for veggie might
35540360	35542360	No, I don't have to try vegemite
35543000	35552200	I'll get vegemite then for the hand cam stream. Thank you reluctantly saying I'll get vegemite in freaking toast
35552200	35554760	I don't even buy bread. I don't even get buy bread
35555560	35558760	Skullfish is a good one. Thanks. I stole it from a reefling
35559960	35564200	Thank you for giving me that. Um, wait, do we need a membership on old school runescape to
35565240	35568600	Not necessarily for what we're gonna do
35568760	35573560	But I think if we I don't know yet like I don't know we're gonna do some quests
35573640	35579240	But I'm pretty sure like everything's behind a freaking lock and it's so expensive for old school runescape membership
35579640	35584520	I don't know. Maybe there's a rich reefling that's willing to buy bonds and gift it to reeflings
35584600	35587960	But that's not like my place to ask for
35588840	35591640	It's a bit. Hmm. I don't know if we have any
35592440	35595160	try hard reeflings on old school runescape like
35596120	35598760	I think I have about 12,000 coins in old
35600360	35602360	So I can't buy anyone a bond. Sorry
35603880	35609240	And I'm starting on a fresh account. I don't know. Maybe we can like pull our money together to buy bonds to like share to reeflings
35610280	35614520	Will there be you're looking on patreon? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're looking on patreon. It's not problem for me
35614760	35616760	Um, do what we want on patreon
35618520	35620520	The other place we upload wards
35621240	35624120	You asked that and I read that out and then I didn't even reply to you
35624840	35631240	No, well, um, the girls have been using twitter and like putting a go like a download link out
35631880	35635480	um, I don't think any of my content's gonna get taken down because
35637240	35639240	I know the rules
35639240	35641240	I know how to
35643560	35649720	Um, so I don't think we're gonna any any oilers in chat literally any old school runescape oilers. Uh, we summon you
35650680	35652680	I'd like to call upon you
35654040	35657640	My membership is still six dollars because I've had an active substance. Wait
35659080	35662840	You lock in the same subscription price because you did it all the way back then
35664040	35666040	But then you do that you're looking anyway
35666600	35668600	I can look this way
35669000	35671000	She knows the cheese
35672680	35678200	Never touch runescape. Unfortunately. It's like a really, um, it's not a hard game
35678280	35682040	It's literally point and click if you wanted to try it for the first time you can always
35682520	35687880	Start up with us. Um, but if it's not for you, you don't have to play along. It's okay. Please don't worry
35689160	35693880	I know you've been going for nine hours. That's crazy. Look, I'm just gonna yapping. Okay
35695080	35699480	I mean, I could check out marshmallow and we can make it to 10 hours if you want
35700040	35703240	Like I could put my little marshmallow link in the chat
35703480	35705480	He he he
35706680	35711720	Oh my marshmallows in the descriptions. Hold on. I even have I can't even see my screen right now
35712360	35715880	My my stream not my screen. I can't see my screen because it's right in front of me
35717720	35721880	Um, but hold on. How did I do this? How did I put it in chat?
35724360	35726360	I am about to sneeze
35726840	35728840	Boom, oh no
35728840	35735000	Oh, no, it'd be such a shame if you guys asked me questions to round this up to a 10 hour stream. Stop
35736360	35738360	Stop it
35738440	35740440	We're right on the verge of 10 hours. Oh
35741560	35743560	A little countdown to 10 hours, shall we?
35744040	35746040	Well, my four minutes left
35748040	35750040	Oh, I have a lot of marshmallows. Whoops
35751160	35755000	Someone says I'd love to spread your cheeks and lick every perfect. Oh
35755560	35762600	I wasn't supposed to read that part out loud. Hey, I'm glad you do
35765960	35770760	Uh, god, your salty gamer rage makes me want to have hard sweaty angry
35773880	35776120	I can't can't read that one either. Um
35776200	35778200	Um
35784440	35789400	Hi, scrawny, hopefully you're well. This is my first time using marshmallow glad I could pop your marshmallow cherry
35789640	35791640	I don't know if you
35792360	35794920	Read any of these. Oh, I read all my marshmallows
35795640	35797640	Hmm. I have a few questions
35798040	35804760	You stream so much that I'm wondering if you'll be taking a break from ASMR. No, I'm streaming ASMR in two days
35805640	35811400	No break from ASMR. I've got ASMR cards coming out as well. I just need to write the scripts and send them off
35811960	35813960	but it's gonna be good
35816760	35821160	Yeah, I've got time for ASMR all the time because yeah, I also got loads of managers in place
35821640	35827000	The only thing I need to do really is be the messenger owl that sends clips to editors now and
35827400	35833080	Upload stuff on behalf of the girls like Mercy just wakes up and she's like got new shorts on her channel. She has no idea
35833480	35836440	That's me doing it. Actually Emmy has another
35836920	35841880	Is that short? Yeah, Emmy has a short and she's like she's just gonna wake up and it's gonna be on her channel
35843320	35845320	Already tagged up and everything for
35846040	35848040	Yeah
35849880	35851880	Unless I didn't read that right
35855800	35858760	Yeah, I know I know how my ASMR is gonna be
35859400	35863480	I can also upload full videos to Twitter as well if anything ever did become an issue
35863560	35866760	Like if I did like a little ASMR video, so it's not a problem
35867400	35872920	The level organization is ascending as so the girls aren't stressed if the girls had to stream
35874360	35878120	And they had to run around and worry about trying to get clips out and shorts out
35879320	35882680	Not good combo. Not nice. Not nice. Um
35883240	35885240	Oh
35888360	35892280	No, wait, what hi strong you feel a bit embarrassed. We are not supposed to be there
35896840	35901720	Oh, no, it's okay someone says they feel embarrassed because they messed up in chat at some point
35901880	35907320	Don't be silly. You're allowed to mess up and chat all you want. I can't even I can't even write in English
35908120	35916280	I like don't worry like emmy emmy had to a script where she had to see a putty cat and I accidentally typed pssy
35917480	35920840	Like don't be afraid. I'm making embarrassment mistakes. They're not embarrassing at all
35921480	35925400	Actually, you only feel embarrassment if you let yourself feel embarrassment or something like that
35925480	35928280	It's something about psychology. Like if if you make mistakes
35930520	35932520	Yeah
35933480	35938440	View the girls trying to find a non-lid marshmallow read on stream and possible is honestly not that bad
35938520	35944280	I don't get that many. I honestly don't get that many like the girls show me what they get and I don't seem to get
35944360	35949880	But I haven't been using the other twitter. I think once I start using it properly them
35951480	35953480	Yeah
35954280	35959480	Question for you the other day we talked with casted greek brother hood about how you're the mother of the girls
35959480	35964840	And the reeflings are the father. Does that make emmy your daughter or sister or a daughter or sister?
35976200	35981320	If you're a reefling then technically daughter sister, but if you're not a reefling then it's just a little sister
35982200	35984200	Boom
35984600	35991000	New audio idea angry scots women mounts and rides you after being all day as a fellow scotton
35991000	35993000	I just were hotter than here and so on
35996680	36002200	So I listened to the assassin's creed stream and I was happy that you remembered me and give her the yeah
36002600	36005000	You're like the the main clipper
36006520	36010440	I actually didn't ask that question. I think there was someone else who made a few clips as well
36010680	36014280	I thought about making clips and posting them, but I wasn't too sure if I could use that
36014360	36017240	Oh, no, you can go brah. That's your channel. You own it
36018200	36024520	You make you make custom content. You you have made new creative content. Then guess what copyright is in your favor
36024680	36028360	Don't worry about copyright. Okay. You don't have to worry about copyright or are you joking me?
36028600	36030600	Clip the girls away. Have fun. Have that ye
36032440	36035000	I'm friends with the guy who's already itching to draw the fan art
36036200	36040040	Fan art of who what door what door is getting fan art? Please tell me I want to know
36041000	36043000	I love seeing them get fan art
36044120	36046120	They sound good
36048200	36052360	I like with the olympians better better not think about the family
36060920	36065320	Uh, what type of hypnotism is your favorite?
36070600	36074440	That's too hard to answer honestly
36075400	36077400	I like hypno loss
36077400	36079400	I really like hypno loss
36079480	36083720	Where I'm supposed to hypnotize you, but then backfires and I do as you say
36085080	36086680	So good
36086680	36092520	Any chance of a spiral? Let's play. Oh, I've never played spiral like that before. I would like to try it
36092520	36096200	I'm pretty sure they remastered them and they're like nice cam friendly casual
36096280	36101880	Seems like something that's like cameo-esque where it's like nice and simple to get through so I think yeah
36103960	36105960	You like fraction
36108040	36110040	I would say yes overall
36112600	36119640	It's the one where you go into like a difference or am I I'm I'm messing up for subspace. I might messing up for subspace. Hold on
36121240	36123240	I am
36123560	36127400	Hey, story. I'm probably being a dumb dumb and I haven't found them yet
36127400	36131400	But I was wondering if you could get reference sheets for all the girls chat mask. Oh, yes
36134840	36139560	Amy's chat mascot is in her debut stream you are
36141560	36148520	The light in my dark you are the beating in my heart. I showed you yesterday
36149320	36155080	I should get a reference sheet from them all put together. Maybe I'll get a tweet from the the bail on
36155800	36157800	mmm
36157800	36160200	I can't because Amy's is in a different art style
36164440	36166440	Hmm
36167160	36172280	I know what you're asking for. I don't know the best way to do it. Maybe the discord can post them
36172440	36180360	Maybe maybe the discord should have a reference sheet for all cart all the girls and their mascots
36180600	36183480	That might be the solution that we can come to
36184840	36187160	Would you like to come together on a solution?
36188280	36190280	Or would you like to come together?
36193960	36198200	I'm a little late but congrats on the debuts can't wait to see you and the rest of the girls have in store
36198200	36201320	And it was nice hearing her scorch moment again. Glad you're back
36201960	36207880	Sincerely a h little reddish boy. Oh, yeah, it's good to be back terrorizing you
36209160	36213480	He he he he he I cannot wait I cannot wait for days for us to even

36218920	36223400	I wish for you and the girls eternal success. Thank you for such kind words
36224200	36226680	That's so nice. I'm glad you somehow find me funny
36227400	36228600	Um
36228600	36229880	because
36229880	36231320	Yeah, literally
36231320	36235000	Yeah, it's not good. It's it's hard to make jokes. Okay, my first one
36237480	36243080	Oh, yeah, there's an official discord that has notification only none of the girls are in it. So
36243640	36246680	So remember remember what I said in debut 2.0
36247560	36249560	You don't groom us
36250040	36252040	We groom you
36252760	36256920	So none of us are in it, but if you want notifications for when we go live and all that
36259480	36263480	What does it say I need to push you against the wall holding both your hands above your head
36266760	36269880	Uh, I'm I supposed to say this that way
36271320	36273320	I don't know
36276040	36280440	By the way along with the zinc supplements I've started eating celery for you
36280520	36283480	Oh celery is minging though. Thanks for your sacrifice
36283720	36287160	They taste between boring and bitter and I don't like them by all parts are very
36288280	36295560	Are you sure you even I even I draw the line at celery. Sorry. It's so tasteless. I don't understand how it was even
36296920	36302440	And that celery has been genetically selected to produce like that
36303000	36309160	The only way celery is redeemable is in a soup because it's got stock and completely covers the taste of celery
36310840	36314840	Your dedication is appreciated because celery sucks
36316440	36320440	Celery is a peanut butter delivery device. Oh, like a spoon
36321560	36323560	Celials worse though. Mmm
36324520	36328280	That I'm gonna zail them up form down. That's what I remember about
36328680	36331480	That's it. Hold on. I'm just grabbing some water
36332120	36334120	I I I need some hydrate
36341160	36344040	I have been hydrated
36346680	36351480	Oh, no, it's 2 p.m. Already. Oh, it's my bedtime soon
36353640	36359720	Oh, no, wait. No, actually it's good that it's my bedtime soon because that means I get to be on old school rinse
36359720	36361480	game with you even
36361480	36365160	Wait, actually, I just realized we're doing a first freaking stream state game tomorrow
36365320	36367320	Oh
36367640	36372200	Oh my god, why did that not register? We've literally been talking about old school rinse game
36372200	36375080	We get to play our first freaking stream today, but I get to see you all
36376600	36382440	Oh my god. Okay. I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. Oh my god. It's tomorrow. I want to go to sleep, right?
36382520	36385080	I'm not I'm not gonna be able to sleep. It's like christmas
36386280	36388280	It's like christmas
36388520	36390520	I'm gonna be too excited
36391080	36396280	Are we all gonna like have code name? I don't know. Should we have theme names or we're all just gonna name our names like how we are
36398280	36399720	Five
36399720	36404120	I'm just gonna say this right now. Someone says hopefully you'll play five hours five hours
36404680	36408840	No, we're doing 12 hours. Okay 12 hours or go home
36409080	36413160	So I'm going to give everyone as much of a chance as possible to show up in old school rinse game
36413640	36418120	I will put the world we are on in the top corner or something
36418360	36420760	So you can see it any minute. What is runescape?
36421320	36423320	Runescape is an old
36424200	36427720	Web game. Is that a web game? I don't know if it's a web game now
36428760	36429960	um
36429960	36434360	Beget if you have trouble falling asleep just look at a mirror and hypnotize yourself true
36436600	36439160	I'm aware that's below your average
36440360	36443080	The most runescape players average on the game
36443560	36448680	Oh, do they they had enough after five hours me just like right. Let's do a fashion show
36448840	36453080	Everyone go to the grand exchange and get some pretty clothes on. I'm gonna write who has the best
36454120	36460440	Oh, wait, there's houses and can I bring you to my house and runescape? I'm right. I don't know
36461720	36465640	How membership works, but I'm pretty sure you can get house and runescape
36466520	36467320	um
36467320	36470680	Because I remember watching someone play hide and seek in runescape
36470920	36477320	And he was like chasing around like the people in stream. We can play hide and seek and taking runescape
36479240	36481240	Oh my god
36481320	36484680	Yeah, and it has this one's go. Oh my god
36485640	36487640	Oh my god, can we play hide and seek?
36488200	36493560	I want to be the seeker and I get to touch you all and if you're touched you have to like go in the corner
36493800	36496200	Until the winner is crowned
36496920	36498920	Really are getting screwed
36499720	36503640	I've never played runescape. Well, everything you're describing it sounds very close to ojicob penguin
36505960	36507960	Oh my god, I want to play tag
36509560	36514280	And I'll be like right run away from didi didi didi. Oh, no, who's that? Oh, no, but we won't be able to know who's that
36514360	36516360	So we can all play hide and seek. Okay
36517160	36519880	Shawnee if you phrase it like that everyone will like touch them
36521160	36523160	No, no, you're not wanting to get caught
36524120	36527480	What if we use our runescape beds next to each other ha ha jk
36529880	36534440	I sadly can't start a new game. I already have three games that take full time and one of them I play
36535800	36539480	Well world of warcraft someone was like, well, I say so
36540040	36542920	They were like, I'm no longer doing wow reads to watch your streams
36542920	36550120	I'm like, no, your girl's gonna be so annoyed at you. Like I've had the chance to play world of war. Ah, what was the expansion called?
36552840	36555560	It was like the second last expansion of wow
36556440	36561560	Um, I had a chance to play it and apparently people role play in this place called goldheim
36562120	36566840	And I'm like, should we play wow and just like be like really weird roleplayers that
36568040	36569320	I'd like
36569320	36572680	Shadowlands, I think it's shadowlands is why I played
36573400	36574840	um
36574840	36581320	No, not the battle not the battle of adedroff. Oh, okay brain needs to catch up. Hold on. Hold on brain needs to catch up
36581560	36583560	Not the battle of azaroth
36584520	36588840	Gold chart and something like that. Yeah, the gold chart and we should all go role play there
36589480	36593640	I would like make like make people really uncomfortable and we're all just like role playing
36595640	36598120	Wow ascension is a thing. I don't know what that is
36599720	36601720	The the elf and her dwarves. Oh
36604040	36606040	Wait, what would we be
36606680	36613000	Can I be can I be a cute night elf and then you guys could all be worgens for some unwritten reason
36613720	36615720	Mm-hmm
36617160	36620600	Pop tropica is still a thing too pop tropica
36622760	36624760	Hmm

36638600	36640600	Did that did that work
36641560	36648840	Oh, no, it doesn't work. Wait for some reason the sound works on my freaking game. Hold on. We're like wink wink
36654280	36658120	There we go, wait that played twice. I don't know why it doesn't do it on the screen. That's strange
36658760	36660760	It's the same instance. Oh, well
36661400	36663400	Sorry that took me so long to do
36663880	36667560	We should be orcs and you should be an elf for no reason at all
36668520	36670920	Oh gee, I sure wouldn't love to be overpowered
36672360	36675480	I take a drink of hydration of water to hydrate
36679400	36685000	Hi good morrow dear silly cuttlefish. I'm very sleepy. So I'ma be brief
36685640	36688360	I absolutely don't watch in here. That's okay. Shame and today
36689560	36695080	And it's been so unreal to watch you be all silly again. I absolutely adore you and hope all of you are girls
36696040	36702440	And what sorry I absolutely adore you and your hopes for the vealer girls and everything and I hope you all make it happen
36702520	36707480	For your happiness is mine and I'm always kicking my feet blushing tapping and stuff. Thank you for making
36709400	36711400	Thank you for such kind words
36712200	36716680	Got you twirling your hair and stuff. Huh got you twirling your hair and stream
36718040	36724280	Are you and the girls ever gonna play minecraft together? Yes, July is when the group minecraft server goes up
36725080	36726120	Amy
36726120	36730680	Definitely the most minecraft day out of us all. I don't know how the scale goes
36730760	36735720	But i'ma confidently say i'm probably the lowest on the scale of like minecraft knowledge
36736120	36740040	All I know is that apparently the mob votes
36741400	36742280	Are
36742280	36746120	They vote people voted for the freaking stealth phantom things
36746360	36749960	If you don't sleep for more than two days, they attack you through walls and stuff
36750360	36755320	And I know that was the mob vote and apparently the mod vote is also rigged because
36756040	36758040	It doesn't make sense
36759240	36764200	I don't know but I don't know if it's rigged. I think it's because people don't understand
36765080	36766600	like
36766600	36769240	kids will vote and kids don't vote for
36770040	36772040	things that are like
36773320	36778120	Good they vote for what kids want and maybe that's why the votes are always so skewed
36780600	36783880	Yeah mob votes terrible. I tried and voted for the crab
36784600	36786600	Wasn't there not like an alternative?
36787000	36790840	I can't remember. I assume mercy and her motion sickness might be a bit of a struggle
36791560	36792840	Yes
36792840	36794840	mercy
36795800	36797800	I would love
36798200	36803640	It's hard. I don't know if minecraft would set it off although she can she can change the camera
36804280	36806840	So it might not affect her motion sickness
36807160	36812840	I'll need to ask a bit more about it because because I don't have it. I don't know what kind of like sets are off all the time
36813640	36818840	Kids running around. I can't believe it kids reeling the way that kids game isn't used terrible
36819240	36821960	I hydrate again. Oh my voice is feeling it mr. Krabs
36824840	36829560	I'm pretty sure you can move out your camera angle. Can you not on minecraft or am I just making that up?
36830920	36832920	They look cool never stuck them forever
36833640	36836920	Yeah, I will agree the design of it looked cool
36837800	36840200	But its actual thing in game
36841000	36842520	is rubbish
36842520	36844520	like rubbish
36845800	36847800	um
36851560	36854360	What does that mean what are you asking me?
36855160	36862440	Forgot to send this. Thank you mommy for all your girls. So cute. Oh, I wanted to mention that so many people are like thanking me for like
36863320	36868280	The girls being the girls. I'm like, no you thank the girls. I didn't do anything
36869000	36875000	If you're thanking me for picking them again, that's the girls that did that. It was through either
36876200	36877720	their
36877720	36884120	Introduction or their con their own content like it's the girls. It's the girls you should be thanking not me
36884920	36886680	Goobers
36886680	36888680	It's the girls
36889080	36891080	So thank the girl
36891720	36898600	The reason people say that the vote is rigged is because Compton created tell people to vote for a certain more of their four effects and vote
36899720	36904760	Compton Compton who's Compton sounds like a town in London somewhere
36905640	36907800	Or a bottle sorry a bottle in London
36908680	36912200	You picked an amazing bunch though. They're all awesome. Ah, I'm glad you agree
36913160	36915320	There'd be nothing short of perfect
36916040	36920040	As in they are perfect. That's how that's how you say they're perfect, right?
36920360	36926840	They're nothing they're they have been nothing but perfect. Yeah, that's how you say it. Yeah, okay. Man of heat angles
36935080	36941080	Wait, oh no, right you guys are welcome to laugh. I think this is terminology. I'm not familiar with
36941800	36943400	if I see a
36943480	36945480	pace tripper
36947240	36952360	What's a hololive homo? Oh, what's a knee-gee male? What?
36955080	36959560	What's that? Am I being dumb? I don't know what that is
36961960	36963640	They're asking
36963640	36965640	Do I have am I able to shadow ban them?
36967480	36972200	All right, maybe maybe this no maybe this no, I don't quite understand it. Sorry
36973800	36975800	Hmm
36979960	36981960	Why is someone sending me
36983080	36985080	a detailed no
36986200	36990200	Is this is this far and on is this toilet bowl far and on
36991720	36999480	Oh ye gods how I wish for that most delightful of noise to curl into mine deprived ears with such intensity
36999560	37001560	I yearn to experience the sound of
37002200	37003560	straw knees
37003560	37005560	splutter gutter as it
37006280	37011000	Flaps a flutter the noise like a walrus burping up butter
37011880	37013240	the parps
37013240	37015080	and
37015080	37017080	It's like a chorus of
37017400	37018920	angels
37018920	37020760	unleashing their art
37020760	37022040	the pungent
37022040	37029400	Bay bass bass that can only be played alongside golden harps to shepherd the dead who has come and died
37029480	37035880	When hearing straw knees fart that is so toilet. There's no way you're not toilet bowl and on
37038760	37040760	Just for very quick lore
37040760	37044200	Someone ages ago sent me a thing and it's like I really want to hear you fart
37044840	37050600	On the toilet and I'm like what you want it to be amplified by echoing off the rim of the toilet
37050920	37055480	And from then he was crowned freaking toilet as bowl and on
37056440	37064040	I don't want to miss what cursed filth at the eye brought upon at the how brought upon these lands
37066360	37071240	Hi my love, I want to hmm and me right in front of you while you hold her hand
37072840	37075000	You may careful what you wish for you may be getting it
37075880	37079000	You may be getting it with all the girls actually possibly
37080440	37082440	There's
37083160	37085480	Hmm. Yes, I need to I need to see
37088760	37091800	He wants to hear the reverb full acoustics literally
37092840	37094840	What they wanted to hear that?
37096200	37098200	You're only allowed to hold hands
37101000	37103400	I have a plan for my own a song
37104040	37108200	But it requires a team effort and it's quite a lot to ask the girls like
37108760	37113400	Oh Dota songs are like you need to help each other out type them, but I'm gonna try my best to make it as easy as possible
37114280	37117640	but I would like to release a certain audio and
37119000	37121000	basically
37121240	37125880	In it, I give you a pill that negates any need for a
37127000	37129000	pause champ if you will
37129720	37131960	And then I take you daughter by daughter
37133320	37135320	It's so messed up saying out loud
37136040	37140760	But yeah, and I tell you like all the good things and encourage
37147480	37151720	But I don't I I need to I need to let it cook. Okay. I need to let it cook
37152360	37155720	And I need a donut on in the first place to even start cooking up
37156520	37159320	But wait in there. Yeah, we ain't doing that. We weren't even on the apart
37160840	37162840	That's a very silly pill
37162920	37167240	Lord grant me strength. Would you please give us a heads up for when it comes out so we can see?
37168680	37170680	Oh my god, mon
37171960	37173400	Please do that
37173400	37175400	She kicked a whole six course dinner
37176600	37178600	I'm a gourmet chef
37178760	37180760	Well, if I get 99
37180920	37184600	Um cooking on runescape, then yes, I am a chef
37185400	37186760	confirmed
37186760	37191080	Any plans for haptic support? Ah, I keep I keep getting asked, but I don't know what it is
37191160	37193880	I don't know what I need to do to the audience to make that happen
37194840	37199320	I don't know if it's like I run it through a data thing or whoa. I don't know
37201400	37203400	I'm too dumb
37204280	37208040	Hold on. I'm gonna fix my calibration and I'm wiggling a bit too much
37212280	37214280	Okay calibration calibrate
37215960	37219160	Are we cooking an own school runescape something? Yes
37219880	37224920	I don't know how to make money in runescape, but we're gonna be buying lobster so we can level up
37225480	37230760	If not, we'll use barbarian village and we'll pick up all the salmon that all the bots drop
37233960	37238120	Shawnee, do you reply to marshmallows privately? No, um, I don't
37239400	37242760	I reply on stream or I put together a mosaic
37243400	37247480	A mosaic? Is that the correct word where I put all the pictures together
37248440	37250120	I'm posting
37250120	37253720	But I've only done that once I should maybe do it again sometime
37254680	37257080	And then I can talk about all the naughty things
37258280	37260280	Wow
37261720	37266040	Here's a funny story about three medieval kingdoms. I'm scared to click as a piece but
37268920	37270760	What?
37270760	37276120	Hey, story. I love your work. Any chance to do a belly button counting? No, you don't like to see my belly button
37276200	37279000	Why would you want to see my belly button? I don't like my belly button
37279800	37281800	belly button
37281800	37283800	belly button
37284360	37286360	Is that your choice?
37286360	37288360	Is that your choice of finishing location?
37289160	37291160	Hmm
37291160	37293160	Your choice interesting
37295960	37298840	Good night, Shawnee. Just thought you'd want to know I'm gonna jet. Oh
37300360	37304120	I can't read the end of that. Uh, enjoy your night time routine. Sleep well
37304840	37307880	Uh, oh my oh my
37310440	37313400	Uh, hi, Shawnee. I want to hold your body again
37318360	37320360	Oh
37321800	37323800	I can't read any of these
37323800	37327880	There's a free game called fantasy star online too. I haven't played it in years
37327960	37331080	But every weekend there's a hatsunimiku con that's so specific
37331080	37334200	Why is there a hatsunimiku concert in the middle of fantasy star online too?
37335160	37337160	I'm thinking
37341160	37345160	You air blue eyes hiding in your wi-fi
37345960	37350920	Shawnee just want to let you know for old school runescape being on a members world is almost a requirement for any skill training
37350920	37356360	You can quest together with people and free to play but the gameplay is limited. Oh, but it's so expensive
37357240	37359240	Oh
37359640	37361640	Stop reading them out loud
37362200	37364120	By like reading them
37364120	37367000	It's only me or is it me saying a lot more
37369080	37371080	Things than she do
37372440	37376520	Hey, are they both on? No, they're not online right now. You mean in the ASMRs?
37377000	37379000	I don't know
37383160	37387400	People are bored bold on marshmallow. Yeah, that's the best part
37388440	37390680	They tell me everything they want
37391480	37394120	And I give them everything they want
37395160	37397160	That's a good exchange
37400040	37402040	Can you please say
37402600	37404600	um
37405000	37407320	What are you gonna use it for if I say it?
37409000	37411640	And you didn't tell me what tone to say it in either
37414120	37417240	You didn't tell me what tone to say the sentence in either
37418440	37422520	Hmm, I need to think how would you want me to say it?
37424680	37426680	Hmm, I lost the game
37427720	37429880	This is that the tone you wanted it?
37430280	37437400	If you want me to say something you need to give me tone. You need to give me the emotion. I don't know
37447080	37449640	Wait, strong enough wait what?
37453480	37457400	Wait, is that that giffy game where if someone says you lost the game
37457640	37459640	You've lost us
37460440	37462440	Wait, is that what it
37462760	37465000	Rip game players wait, what does that mean?
37465880	37471560	It's a silly game right where people say I lost the game and then you lose it until you win it on your streak
37472360	37474520	If you think about the game you lost, okay
37476520	37479640	The only objective of the game is to not think about the game. Oh
37481320	37487320	Okay, oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I just made you all lose. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking that
37488360	37490360	I'm sorry
37491080	37493080	I didn't think that forehead
37495240	37499160	Can I suggest something secret totally say so confession maros to read on stream?
37499240	37502120	Yeah, you can like you can literally type in the maros right now. Do I have
37503240	37505240	Can I can I send it like this?
37506280	37507880	Did that work it did?
37507880	37513320	Yeah, you can just put it in there and if you want me to say something just put the emotion and then like little quotation marks
37513720	37516120	I'll also take requests here in the ASMR stream as well
37516200	37522120	So if you ever wanted me to hear it kind of whispered a bit on on a different microphone because this is an asm b7. I'm using
37524840	37530120	At least we lost this drawing. I heard about this like 25 years ago an elementary
37531480	37536200	My discipline. I'm sorry. Okay. I distract you. I will say other things
37536200	37542440	Did you see the reefing zip-up hoodie design Mario? I send on their deer. What do we bear?
37543080	37546920	Oh, if you've got those if you've got those kind of pictures, please send on twitter
37547320	37550200	But I will say my twitter tags are freaking working
37550840	37552840	I'm trying to find
37552840	37559080	This freaking artwork on smuttle and it doesn't show up. I don't know why it doesn't show up
37562360	37565720	Uh, what's your favorite type of hypnotic induction to use?
37567000	37569000	um
37569160	37571160	I think
37572920	37574920	I like repeated pattern
37575240	37579480	Come to the ASMR stream and I'll show you what I like. Okay deal
37580760	37583320	Huh, are you gonna show up and I'll show you what I like
37584440	37588440	She went like and people are gonna judge me, but I like it
37589080	37590840	So I'll do what I like
37590840	37592840	Sometimes the stony is a good girl. Hell yeah
37593080	37595080	Yeah
37595400	37601960	You uh, I'm good at advertising. Okay. I'm in I'm in. Hey stony. Here's the soft safer work Mario. Do you have a throne?
37602760	37606360	I do but I've unlinked it because
37608360	37613320	I have everything I need now that I've got my reef links. I don't need a single thing else
37615400	37617800	Hmm and that's that
37617800	37619800	I
37620120	37622600	Don't need anything so I've unlinked my throne
37624120	37626120	I'm gonna say how many
37626360	37628360	Have you received so far? Um
37629400	37631720	Not a lot the girls are getting a lot more than me
37632840	37636120	I think the refunds are a little shy a little shy or a little scared
37637160	37641720	Well, you and the girls be able to mhm yourself and members streams. Uh, most likely yes
37643480	37646200	Stony doesn't make you happen people send you the spicy messages
37648200	37651160	Please let me please tell me all the scenarios you want to do to me
37657320	37661400	Are there any games where there's an alt path you haven't tried and would you consider them?
37663000	37665000	I can't think of any off the top of my head
37665480	37671640	I normally probably like game starts game ends. I never pick the bad team if there's a bad side
37672200	37674200	stinky
37674840	37677800	Unless you count the companions in Skyrim
37682440	37685080	Does anyone here like the companions in Skyrim?
37686440	37692040	Oh wait, I'm on the freaking wrong thing. Sorry. Hold on. Let me do that again. Does anyone here like the companions in Skyrim?
37695400	37698680	Yeah, exactly. That's what I thought that's what I thought no one likes them
37699640	37704760	Yeah, boo exactly
37706840	37708440	You think they're fine
37708440	37713320	I don't I never although the first time you play it. It's like wow really good, but
37714120	37716920	The freaking on xbox

37771560	37773560	Um
37773560	37777400	Oh my god, I love you and the girls so much. I created a twitter account just to follow the six year
37777400	37781000	I hate I had to turn into I know. Thank you for going through it
37781000	37784760	It's such a pain my account keeps getting freaking locked and it keeps making me prove
37784840	37787960	I'm not bought over and over and over and over and over and over and over again
37788440	37790440	Look, I just want to look at small fish. I want to
37791080	37793080	And then I want to go to sleep, you know what I'm saying
37793880	37797800	Hi Johnny. Oh, sorry. I don't know why I gave you that voice. I'm so sorry. I apologize
37798360	37804360	Hi, strongy. I woke up in a Euro time zone and found out the party was still going 10 hours in the avatar stream
37805160	37809240	Yeah, I really admire your energy and autism as you call it. Thank you
37809720	37813480	If you want to play old school runescape tomorrow, we are going to be live for 12 hours
37813800	37815640	Cheeky endurance stream
37815640	37817000	What's that?
37817000	37820760	I stream more in one week than the average wee chipper does in a month
37821400	37823400	I'll wear that with pride
37826280	37830920	Hmm, so I I don't I don't have snot coming out my nose. I'm drinking water
37835880	37837880	Yeah, wishes
37838520	37840520	Hi strongy. Thanks for being a butt so
37841480	37846200	Okay, you can you can finish the rest
37850840	37856120	Strongy guess what you just took my marshmallow marshmallow of engineering get plapped get plapped get plapped
37857080	37861640	Looking forward to the old school runescape. I also recommend final fantasy if you want more mmo's also
37861880	37865960	Would you accept script ideas family scripts? Yes, I would I don't have a problem
37866920	37873400	Um, there may at a later date not now not in this month things need to settle where um
37874680	37876680	We can take official script submissions
37876680	37882840	However, if veal or where to take like subscriptions it submissions for audios
37883560	37885000	purposes
37885000	37890520	Sadly, you have to fully hand over the rights. So we have the right to monetize. We have ownership
37890840	37892840	We're happy to give credit. Um
37893560	37899640	I think I don't know if there's gonna be a problem given credit. I haven't thought that far ahead at the moment, but
37900760	37903560	There's a lot of issues and it's quite a shame
37904040	37907000	And it's really hard to iron out at this point in time
37907080	37911480	But once the dust settles and things get a bit better wait get plapped. What are you doing to this?
37915000	37920520	Do you still have love for the big boy reeflings out there I couldn't help but notice a line in your lore video
37923720	37925720	Yes
37927800	37932040	And there's just something I've got to say you're as beautiful as the day I lost you oh
37932920	37934600	Thank you
37934600	37938440	That's the how to train your dragon. That's one of the only books I read as a child
37938680	37943160	I think I read like three books as a childhood and one of them was how to train your dragon
37944360	37947560	I don't know how I read a book honestly, but I did it
37947880	37949880	Hmm
37950200	37951560	She's
37951560	37953560	dunking us in the water
37954280	37957720	The books were so good. Literally one of the only books I read as a child
37957880	37962920	I've read more books this year than I have in my entire life, which is crazy
37963720	37965720	crazy
37965720	37968600	I'd pretend that I can do a book review. So I'm not even smart enough for that
37968680	37973000	I'm currently trying to get through the handmaidens tale. I actually am enjoying the handmaidens tale
37973240	37978040	I'm like a few chapters in but I I don't know if people find this cheating
37978440	37981480	But I have to have the book read to me or I can't read it
37982680	37986520	I this sounds really bad, but it takes up too much brain power to read the words
37987080	37991320	manually, so I read along whilst being spoken to by tts voice
37992760	37998120	And no and I can speed it up like super fast. Oh, thank you for the raid
37999240	38001240	How did your stream go?
38002200	38008600	How did your stream go rain? Oh, you might be tired. So don't feel forced to talk. Don't feel forced to talk if you're a tired little barbie
38010200	38014200	Hey barbie, I should have said background music. It's like really quiet in the stream. I don't know if it's
38014760	38016760	Maybe nice. I hope your stream was good
38017560	38022760	Endurance streamer creative director and so has time. I've not read any books since debut. I can show you that much
38023080	38027960	But hi raiders. I'm strong and cut loose from violour. I'm really inappropriate
38027960	38033160	So I do apologize if I know your cup of tea and I'm also Scottish so I'm super hard to understand but thank for hanging out anyway
38035320	38039160	Which is I hope your stream went fantastic. Please rest up after your stream
38039160	38044040	I'm sure you're tired and last thing you want to do is get bombarded with loads of questions from the person
38044040	38047560	You have kindly rated into so I thank you kindly rain cloud
38048040	38051400	And I hope you have a fantastic rest after your

38060680	38063560	Entry all in one breath. She's got lungs. Hey
38065320	38071160	Strongly looking to push 11 hours at this rate. Should we should we just yap and then make it another 12 hours?
38073080	38076280	Why is the raid message wait wait? I saw it as weight as well
38076520	38080520	Like I could hardly read but I had to scroll over. I mean if I make another cup of tea
38081320	38083640	We could in theory make it 12 hours again
38084040	38087640	And we just like and we can just talk and I can ask you questions
38087720	38090920	And then you ask me questions and then I'm going to ramble about something
38091560	38093560	And then you distract me
38093560	38095560	And then we're going to another ramble
38095880	38103000	Do you want that? Yes, please? Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Her favorite form of introduction is tying you until you can't help but fall asleep
38103400	38105160	They happen a
38105160	38109800	You feel yourself getting so asleep. They don't know what we're playing. Yeah
38111160	38113160	It's okay

38135720	38137720	I can't I can't get enough of you
38138280	38141320	And when we do Elden Ring, I am incredibly
38143000	38145000	I'm incredibly tempted
38145400	38147240	to possibly
38147240	38152680	Figuratively do a 12 hour and then raid into a six hour afterwards. I don't know
38154120	38157480	It's plausible. I'll be a tired bean. I don't know
38158600	38162680	I wish we could get 14 hours 14 is the like perfect slot of like I can
38163240	38165240	Still get a full night's rest
38166760	38172920	Lord inject the scottish lass lord if you can hear me right now inject the scottish lass into my veins

38220440	38227560	Okay, let me move my water out of the way. So I can at least attempt to do something mildly professional for once in my life. Okay
38228840	38231720	Once in my life I did something a little bit or maybe a little bit
38232440	38241080	It's okay to be sleepy

38275960	38284360	And your brain is quiet slow slow slow
38284680	38292520	Good night. That's what we've been waiting for. Until the morning
38298600	38300840	Did I do it did I do it right?
38302280	38304280	Slow slow slow
38305240	38307240	Into the slumber you fall
38309080	38311080	I don't know if I was too close because I'm like, oh
38314520	38317320	But I need to show up. Seems like you did
38320040	38323560	A little sleepy moment. Thank you so much. Good night

39163240	39169480	Ever since you've debuted I've gone from a man lost in the desert drying of thirst to one drowning in a flood of non-stop good times
39170200	39171240	Yes
39171240	39174440	And all I want to do is just close my eyes and let the waves take me

39196920	39198920	No other lower related reason
39200920	39205640	It was awfully cold in the depths, but now we're in warmer waters. I think you could say
39208600	39211400	Can you run from prime minister of Australia? So at least they're
39212280	39219000	If it's bad ideas, it sounds nice coming from me, but I've not even been granted rights into the country yet

39222360	39224360	Where I get rejected
39224440	39228040	And I can't I have to go back to Scotland and I can't run the business

39295080	39300520	Lost planet too. I should actually write down game ideas because I I trust your guys's like
39301400	39304440	Suggestions over anything that I could possibly come up with
39305960	39307320	Um

39311320	39313320	highly rated game

39330520	39334120	I don't know when it came out. Maybe it was still at the stage where like
39335160	39340120	So I used to get attached to one game and when Assassin's Creed brotherhood came out like I hardly got any new games
39340200	39342200	I've got skyrim. I got
39343160	39346280	Black ops ac brotherhood
39347480	39351080	The rate of like new games like went down astronomical
39351880	39354280	If it's probes of 2006 2008

39412520	39415960	To like stop them from jumping to the objective or whatever
39416440	39420040	And I used to have to beg I was so bad at the game
39420600	39422600	I would basically have to beg
39423240	39427800	To people would hold back to let me through the first level
39428360	39433160	Because I ended up losing it so many times that I wasn't playing the game
39433240	39437400	And I was spectating you guys play because I was that freaking bad at the game
39437960	39439960	That is so much fun
39440680	39446040	So yes, you will absolutely be playing that again. I will always do like a
39447480	39449480	A stream snip game every month
39449560	39451640	Um one that's like public and one
39452520	39455080	I do prioritize free to play games
39455560	39457560	Unfortunately, I've started off with runescoop
39458520	39462840	Which normally premium is the only way to play it. So I've picked a bit pearly
39463800	39467000	I do apologize, but I would like to get 99 cooking

39502840	39504840	And then the second panel was like
39505320	39508760	I was like throwing this scottish beam out of my mouth and it reminded me

39628840	39630840	Got tape on her
39631080	39634120	The only reason she's a vtuber is to give herself

39641640	39647480	No, the distracts. Yeah, that's right. You're in distracts again. Oh, I just punched my knuckle against the desk by accident
39649000	39655880	Someone says I kneel you are too powerful so much kneeling. I like it do it again
39657960	39661960	It is humbling to know someone like you exist. I've never dumped so much
39662440	39666600	Ink before within a span of a week
39667800	39673640	And from it so happy from watching you and the girls. I hope for your success and it's one of the few I feel that is deserved

39678280	39684040	I do like hearing about ink spilling like why yes, maybe I am a v sucky after all
39686280	39688280	Maybe there is sucky by blood
39689640	39691640	The pause after hearing
39692840	39699480	Where I live it smells like freshly baked cookies because I'm near a cookie factory and I'm and I'm already awake for today
39699480	39702920	I'm still going strong. Oh, that's dangerous for your health
39703080	39707320	It's dangerous to be awake for more than like 16 hours. I think is when
39708520	39714760	It's bad like it's your brain function. Your cognitive function goes down like big big
39714840	39716840	I

39754760	39756760	Uh
39756840	39763160	I'm so excited. I wonder if anyone could guess that I don't I think it's impossible to get there's too many variations like
39764440	39768600	Someone says is there a chance for a stream of a software game other than elden brain?
39769480	39774520	I don't think I can get any help in the other elden rings though. However, I think
39775640	39778680	She be as interested in blood-borne
39782840	39789480	But unfortunately, I'm not very good and the reason I like elden ring so much is because you guys can come in and help me
39790440	39792440	But I'm not good on my own
39792920	39794600	um
39794600	39798440	Three gens worth of tubers. I will become a husk
39799240	39801240	I'll become a husk honestly
39802360	39804360	Maybe we can guess after the second gen
39813160	39819640	Oh, no, you can't guess it because there's two secret words that aren't present
39820520	39823720	It it forms a sentence basically
39824760	39829400	All three gens perform a sentence that perfectly encapsulates won't be where it is
39832440	39834440	Indulge marionette and you're like nah
39835320	39839480	Yeah, you're no the secret words makes it impossible. Just wanted to drop one more
39839560	39842760	Mario I've watched all the velo girls and well, I like them a lot your mouse. Oh
39843320	39846040	Thank you. Are you sure? I'm your oh, she though like
39847000	39851000	I'm not gonna say anything but like emmy's teas and oof aces accent
39851000	39859880	And she sounds so fucking adorable in our accent. I wish I could copy it, but I can't why is she irish?
39860280	39862280	I see. Why are you irish?
39862600	39864440	I don't know
39864440	39866440	I just love the way she sounds
39866760	39869960	But I feel like I'm doing a terrible. That's terrible
39871720	39873720	You have your own accent power
39874040	39876040	power
39876520	39884760	Sure, well the sentence will look good, but what gen four? No, I am not. I am absolutely not doing any further
39885640	39891640	So there some people were like, are you doing a spin-off gen? Are you doing like a safer work variation? No
39892760	39899720	I've absolutely no interest. I am exhausted. I took so much hp damage getting gen one out
39900440	39904520	I am very thankful to say that if gen two and three do happen
39904920	39911400	The hp damage is reduced significantly because I learned so much. I learned so much
39911960	39913960	and
39914120	39918840	When you do the first time you do it, it's so hard, but anytime after it just gets easier
39919880	39924040	But I am I have no interest. I feel like absolutely no
39925000	39927800	Shade or anything to any other Vtuber agency
39928360	39931480	If you start throwing gen after gen it is very clear
39931640	39936600	You do not give an absolute rat's arse about the content for your girls
39937080	39941480	And it's just it's such a shame that those girls put faith in you as an agency
39941960	39946680	And your response is throw another gen out throw another. No, absolutely. No
39947400	39951080	No, very disappointing. I don't like that. That's just me
39951720	39957080	Uh, you like instantly became my Oshie. I don't have an endurance for long streamers
39957080	39962040	But I really enjoy stopping in on stream throughout the day. I'm glad I'm glad I can catch it

39983640	39989160	Human wave tactic based running strongy. Are there any ASMR stories based on your life?
39991160	39998200	Um, I have rambling ASMR coming out where I'm just kind of talking about stuff that's happening. No, that's me
40001400	40003800	If you mean the small peepee audio then
40003960	40011800	Uh, there's an anon that's very passionate about it and he sent me a prompt and
40012680	40016200	Well, he didn't he didn't actually even mean to make it into a script or anything
40016200	40021320	He just sent me a prompt of what he liked and I was like, you know what you know what I'll make it into something
40021960	40028680	So your guys are more than welcome to use marshmallows to put down your things because it unironically can inspire me to make like an entire script
40029400	40034280	Um, I am happy to take inspiration. I'll yank it. I like reading your deep dark fantasy
40035960	40040920	I want to hit them with a disc tracker. I know but also I don't want to go into them and be like public enemy number one in veilerland
40041640	40043640	I talk a lot of them
40043960	40045960	But I'm such a little teddy bear
40047080	40049080	No, it's all funny you
40049320	40051080	I have to admit something
40051080	40055080	I fall asleep to your voice during streams only for a little bit like 30 minutes to an hour
40055080	40058520	The volume doesn't matter your voice just knocks me out. I get so cozy from the yapping
40059160	40061160	Did I wake you up through the rage part?
40061880	40063000	against
40063000	40067800	Against the rda guy in section. I'm sorry if I woke you up with my screen
40071400	40075400	Hey, stroney, I'm glad to catch some of your lives. I've been recovering from
40076760	40080520	The unmentionable one and I'm finally feeling better. I hope to see
40081560	40084360	many more streams from you and the girls
40085640	40087640	I
40090520	40093000	Someone signed this with their name, sorry

40099480	40104200	I'm hope you're okay, and I'm glad you feel better. You're starting to feel more like yourself
40105080	40108680	Sorry, you've signed it and I don't know if I should see your name out. So for respect
40108680	40111400	I'm not gonna I'm not gonna think it but you guys are welcome to sign maros
40111400	40114120	But I won't see your name if you sign a marrow at the bomb. Okay
40115880	40120040	I'm glad you picked samwise the brave. I am so glad
40121320	40125000	You my refling gave me the courage seriously
40125800	40127800	Why the refling?
40127960	40129400	I don't know
40129400	40131400	Maybe it's because he gives me courage
40133880	40135880	Hi, stroney saying this is the scott
40135880	40139080	So when I say this, you know, it's not just because of the accent
40139400	40143400	I love your voice. Listen to you up on stream is my favorite part of your stream and when you talk
40143960	40148520	Gently it gives me tingles. I'm really looking forward to the ASMR. Wait, I can give you tingles
40148520	40150520	Just when I be a bit more gentler in the magic
40151240	40153240	That's interesting
40153400	40156840	Normally, I like I only happen in the the ting the tingy
40157720	40159720	Goodbye those who are sleeping
40161000	40164360	I gotta go finish up work. Have a good day. Yeah. Have a good day. Thanks for hanging
40165640	40166760	Uh
40166760	40168760	Thank you
40169080	40171080	Definitely not
40171240	40173720	Hmm. What are you saying?

40195240	40197240	I want to take full control
40198120	40200120	Hmm
40200520	40205800	The question is can I put you under though? I'm I'm a bit unskilled at the under part
40205880	40209560	It's scary to put you under because I'm not sure how good I am at it
40210120	40216520	And as well, I don't know if the accent is actually a debuff on putting you under a spell or the control type
40216840	40218840	Section of it. So I'm a bit worried
40219480	40223560	We'll see what happens. As I said, I'm learning and you guys have been fantastic and
40224200	40227560	Will be like you guys are always fantastic and give me like a lot of space
40228040	40230040	It'll take time to get

40736120	40739160	Love emmy's emmy aces frx wait
40739960	40742520	Wait, the reason why I get ac and emmy mixed up all the time
40742600	40747000	Is it because they both begin with I is because I used to call them the twins in development
40747320	40750520	They were called the twins in development. I know they're not twins
40750920	40756760	They I just called them twins. It just happened. Okay. So emmy and ac always get referred to each other by accident
40757560	40759560	Now this few propositions were a question
40761000	40763000	If you had a chance to change your oh

40788040	40791800	But there's something about you that makes you so easy to listen to
40792360	40796120	It's probably because you can tell how low IQ I am. So I make you feel safe
40798040	40800040	See mersey's a dork
40800040	40806760	So you lure your guard around her but me because I'm brain dead. Yeah, you can't help that. You can't help that

40882200	40885240	I like creepy pokemon. I like when they look cute and creepy
40886360	40893800	Uh, who wrote that? And you know, no, no subspace stop it. We're not going into subspace another another time
40893800	40895800	But not not no subspace
40896600	40898600	No subspace. All right
40898920	40900920	I bite it
40901640	40909640	Because if no the problem is if I go into subspace, I can't talk. I literally can't talk. How am I supposed to entertain if I can't talk
40911000	40913000	If I'm just here squealing like a little
40916440	40921880	Subspace emissary reference subspace emissary reference. No
40922760	40925160	subspace is a thinking a type
40926760	40929480	And it makes it really hard for me to freaking talk
40929960	40931960	Through it. It's really freaking hard
40933400	40935160	And I can't talk
40935160	40937160	And I need to be able to talk
40938200	40940200	You can't just stare at my face while I go
40942200	40948440	I'm so happy that I saw you on my Twitter feed. Oh, is that how you found me on Twitter? Oh, maybe I should actually start using Twitter then
40949880	40951880	Oh, I don't like using Twitter
40952360	40957160	All the girls have been so fantastic like I'm streaming in one hour. I'm doing this. I'm doing that
40957560	40960120	I literally have put nothing on Twitter. I can't
40960920	40961800	like
40961800	40963160	I
40963160	40965160	I've used Twitter to make ASMR
40965960	40972280	Collapse that's it. I can't do it. Okay. Please. Please. I can't do it. Twitter please. It's so
40976760	40982680	Can't could stare at your face for an age less you underestimate what you do at karaoke stream with the girls
40983320	40987480	I think latency is too much for me with the girls
40987560	40992120	However, the girls might be able to do it with one another because latency wouldn't be an issue
40993560	40998440	Um, I have to put your stream schedule on my desk to make sure I remember. I'm so bad
40998520	41001720	I apologize if people use twitter for notifications. I I just
41002280	41003720	I don't like it
41003720	41008040	I don't like it. I actually don't like it. I'm sorry. Well, I'm off to work. Good night. And don't for
41008600	41012360	Forget to wash you to brush my teeth. Yes. I won't forget
41012920	41017560	Uh, if it's been 30 minutes since I last drank. Yes, it will be. Okay. We'll brush your teeth right before you end
41017880	41021160	Twitter recently uh, officially allowed the content
41022760	41024760	And it's signal boosting the words mentioning
41025560	41031320	Is it I'ma make a a certain video then I've been needing to make a video as a thank you for ages
41031880	41034760	I'm stalling. I'm scared because maybe I should do it now
41035640	41037640	Maybe
41038280	41039960	Yeah
41039960	41042360	Shimmy shimmy. Yeah, shimmy. Yeah, shimmy. Yeah
41044600	41046600	I wonder what I could be playing
41047800	41051400	And I really strongly mean may have a good sleep schedule because I wake up early to watch
41052200	41053400	Oh
41053400	41058840	I'm glad. Ah, yes, the bits get upside down when they go to Australia. So it takes places long for computer
41061080	41063960	Uh, it's a bit squid me right now by the pope
41064760	41067400	Wow, you really are still online

41070840	41072840	Thank you, paginga. Yes
41073000	41078280	Um, we finished the game around the nine hour mark and then ended up rambling so much
41078280	41080280	We got to the 10 hour mark
41080360	41085880	And then I made a cup of tea and it just made sense that we're just gonna ramble until the 12 hour mark
41086280	41087800	Just because we can
41087800	41091880	Yeah, yeah, no, no, we're just having a good time. We just done our thing. But good morning
41092760	41097160	And I hope you're all ready for it happening again tomorrow because I'll be online all day
41098760	41101880	Hey, let me hear about these things. Why am I going so much?
41106760	41109400	I think I got everything
41111400	41115560	But yeah, I couldn't I couldn't pick a pokemon. I like creepy we pokemon. Oh, no
41116360	41118360	All right, I've refreshed again
41118840	41121160	And there's quite a few more questions. So hopefully I can get to
41122200	41124200	Stream warning. This is meant to me
41126840	41129160	Am I supposed to read it then or not?
41133800	41136280	Yeah, well, I didn't work it right it didn't work
41138520	41140520	He said kneel and submit
41140760	41142600	who bad
41142600	41144600	You're not getting me today
41144760	41148680	I've done see when I do a little bit of the a little bit of the
41149240	41151240	Gnosis when I do the noses

41154920	41156280	You know

41157640	41159640	another another day, baby
41161560	41164040	Good girls are entertaining what even stop right?
41167240	41169240	Scrolling past that stop it
41170920	41174440	You and the rest of the viewer are the first I ran into to lean
41175400	41176920	Into the other side of content
41176920	41179640	I wasn't sure how to take it at first because it's not my cup of tea
41179800	41184680	But you love being genuinely entertaining regardless wishing on but but thank you so much. Yes
41185240	41187240	There is a lot of information on the website
41187800	41191960	And like a lot of people didn't realize what the heck we were doing and it was like bro
41192040	41195240	We're self-beach over so we'll be playing games like of course
41195240	41200040	I'm still going to talk about satan creep brotherhood tune and stream snake and all that, you know
41201000	41204840	It just means we offer the goods on the other side and we're not a blue ball in you
41204840	41209480	I think because there's quite a lot of v-tubers that like to do the blue ball part and it's like well
41210600	41212600	If you if you want the goods then yeah
41213240	41219160	They're for free you can go on all twitters or if you if you want to support uh, then with your with your manis
41219480	41221480	Then you can just do it
41222760	41226680	Patreon or membership if youtube updates it stats tomorrow
41227400	41232040	Hmm you almost went into stuff. I'm not I'm not
41234680	41238360	But yeah, but you occasionally different at the thingy like in preview
41240760	41242760	That was to paint you all up though
41243800	41249320	I think everyone did a good job. We all we all collectively were like, you know that meme that's like
41250040	41252040	Let me hold on maybe I can find it
41252280	41254280	I
41257080	41260600	Put it on string. Oh, yeah, this was literally it
41264360	41266360	Basically this meme if I can see the image
41268360	41270360	This one
41273400	41277720	This was the meme so it was like chaos behind the scene setting up for debut
41278200	41282200	But like we all came together to discuss how we're like absolutely going to destroy
41282280	41285960	Everyone unanimously and like do all these like things to like get everyone pent up
41286440	41289240	I'm not even pretending. Otherwise like literally chaos
41290040	41295320	Is the top one all of us preparing for debut. But when it came to discussing like, okay, let's release the alt twitters
41297080	41298680	That was right now
41298680	41305080	By the pope. I admire your work strongy. You are fantastic. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you so much
41307880	41311880	Why senior in your title? Do I give you an accent? Thank you for the tip though
41312680	41314280	senior
41314280	41319240	I appreciate it. And yeah, I'm glad you enjoyed my work. It doesn't really feel like work. I just feel like I'm
41319880	41321880	You know a rainbow
41324280	41326280	Eight
41326680	41332120	I'm stressing out over nothing my butt said a marshmallow. No, I'm doom spiral. What?
41332600	41337720	Do you need a is it I think it's called a set or if you if you don't
41338520	41341320	Um, if you partake, I think it's called a Sarah like oh
41343240	41345240	You're evil
41345960	41348360	I know you gave us the most wholesome girl in existence
41349640	41352040	I've got a lot of those comments where people are like
41352760	41356440	The whole agency was based around like this alternative thing
41357000	41361800	And then like everyone's just like memeing along and having a good time and all that and it's like yeah surprise
41362440	41365000	Like we're we're here for enjoy ourselves
41365800	41369240	I think it can get quite tiresome of every breath in second. It's
41370360	41372360	you know
41373960	41376360	Are you squiddin me right now identify yourself
41377080	41385640	High strongly and reeflings from euro time zone. Good morning. Good morning. Oh, did you enjoy your sleep? Thank you, alessandro
41386760	41389080	I did enjoy your sleep. We made it. We made it
41390360	41394840	You girls are amazing at getting people in credit with first day
41396200	41402280	My girl's so first day. She a Lamborghini. That's not that song. Oh, what's that song my girl's so thirsty
41403800	41409560	Yellow lumber purple Lamborghini. I have absolutely not clue what that song supposed to be. Thank you for the tip, alessandro
41410920	41414440	Yeah, it could be everything but it makes a nice thing a bit of a male
41415160	41418680	Just curious. But are there any creators you would like to collaborate with outside the group?
41419480	41422920	sadly, I um, uh very
41424200	41426200	I don't know what the word is
41428200	41434840	If people reach out to me, I am more than happy to but I feel like if I reach out then
41435640	41437080	I'm
41437080	41443160	Bothering so like the yumi plus girls will be nothing but receptive to me. I absolutely adore them. So I'm I'm gonna try and
41444120	41447640	Get a collab going with them or something or ASMR or anything like that
41448280	41455000	Um, but like anyone basically the sentence if you f with me. I f with you, but because like
41455960	41457960	Oh strong ease from
41457960	41458840	um
41458840	41463240	Vila or like I don't want anyone feeling forced and I'm also quite
41465560	41470840	I'm appropriate with certain jokes and I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable during a collab. So I only
41471000	41474200	I don't know. I'm just shy like I really like Finn
41474920	41481080	But I would never ask for a collab because I just I I know for a fact like I would just make her uncomfortable
41481400	41486120	So I'm just gonna be like thumbs up from afar. Love your stuff. You know can't wait for the next song cover
41495320	41498760	Stop singing I'm trying to get secret tunnel on my head. Oh my god. That was like so fun
41500840	41502840	I've been a pie
41506840	41514840	Sadly most potential clubs speak English instead of scottish. Oh, they'll never understand me. Well, there was actually something really funny. Um
41515800	41520360	What's that azura in debut called me a fish and when we were doing the mock
41520440	41522760	I was with the girls like um
41523320	41527960	We were doing the mock so five of us were in the voice call and whoever was doing the mock went and did it
41528520	41530520	Um and azura called me a fish
41530920	41536280	And I was like a fish in my accent and the girls were like laughing up a storm over it
41536360	41539480	And I was like, oh, yeah, I freaking love it here
41539560	41542520	Like they're just so amazing and they they just get it
41543160	41548280	But like I feel like if I collabed with someone outside of viola like they're afraid to make fun of my accent
41548280	41551400	I'm like, no make fun of it. Are you joking me? I say words funny
41551720	41556600	Someone was saying like the way I say joe wheel there earlier in that like come on
41557320	41559480	Why is my freaking mouth wiggling?
41560600	41562600	I know
