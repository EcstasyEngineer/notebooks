12
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,400
however you feel like uh i am a technically

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,960
pre-debut uh vtuber but i have been streaming for about three years and i

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,120
am staroni's video editor so you know all those magnificent shorts that are

15
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,560
subtitled and edited out the wazoo that's none

16
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,440
other than arisa the complete mastermind behind those she takes off any

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,880
mental load that i need to think about contemplate

18
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:32,000
anything of that nature but arisa is a fantastic helping hand and now i am

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,640
very happy to see arisa is also someone i consider a friend

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,000
because it has been lovely we've been chatting away

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,680
for a cheeky 45 minutes having a giggle having a

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,000
a gander um now you may notice on my screen that arisa is a png at the

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,960
moment but she mentioned she's streaming i wonder maybe

24
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,640
little reeflings in the future uh we might be doing a watch along of

25
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,640
someone's debut that's coming very soon and

26
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,400
there is uh i mean i don't know how much i'm allowed to see

27
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,560
am i allowed to say anything i'm so bad at keeping secrets specifically

28
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,720
relating to my own stuff not only do i get to leak veal or secrets at

29
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,600
all times i now get to leak arisa's debut secrets okay

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,760
um arisa has successfully acquired all the assets she needs for

31
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,520
debut which is fantastic so there's only one more thing

32
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,280
that we were waiting on which is the model and rigging

33
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,640
um and please do not think that this will be the only time you will see arisa

34
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,760
because i'm forcing you to watch her again and i say i dare say if our

35
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,800
friendship isn't ruined over this video game of moving out to that i will i

36
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,520
would very much love to collab with her again at some point so don't don't be

37
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,840
shy give arisa some love actually you know what i'll link here twitter

38
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,640
unfortunately uh arisa has been downgraded to a v-tweeter because she's

39
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,720
not streaming right now so unfortunately it is over for her it's over

40
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:23,120
um i promise i'm a streamer i love me

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,200
but don't be afraid to follow she's a hoot in a holler

42
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,040
um so we we we we we we we aren't french for one but

43
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,160
we are playing a game called moving out to which was developed by a australian

44
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:44,480
studio unbelievably and we are going to give it a

45
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,600
shot neither one of us have played it at all so you're

46
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,520
getting a live reaction of the shenanigans that are

47
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,960
about to ensue and have no idea so the whole the premise of

48
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,960
this stream is i've run out of funds to pay arisa for the

49
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,240
shenanigans which isn't quite the truth but

50
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,080
um arisa you know she gave me a little nudge she gave me a little wink and she

51
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,600
said you know what come do come move furniture with me

52
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,640
and then i'll i'll edit some stuff for free so okay okay you got me so

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,480
can actually get a grant for developing your game

146
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,000
um i don't know if it's like sydney region only or something

147
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,640
i've got an achievement for that reach fart level one

148
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:06,960
oh wait i got it too um we were talking about the grant

almost too normal yes this job definitely isn't to lull you

183
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,760

honestly i was having it

280
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,800
when you like spend your whole life here we have so many like big spiders that

281
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,840
when you just see a little spider in your room like that's just my pal now

282
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,080
like that's a roommate it's fine he pays rent by eating the flies

283
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,040
yeah that's literally no it was horrifying so in skulls uh

284
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,800
cockroaches aren't a thing so i got to see my first cockroach as well

285
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:50,560
that really cockroaches are awful uh my cat hunted one and gave it to me as a

286
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,840
gift and then she ate it in front of me so that was lovely

287
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:01,120
lovely leveling up means going up a level right okay watch those stairs

288
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,480
ooh stairs i love stairs wait why am i american i don't know i love the feeling

289
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,080
the burn deep in my eyes okay we're getting a bird's eye view of the map

290
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,680
we're scanning we're scanning there's a few bits and bobs

291
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:21,200
i don't know how you're supposed to know what the secret object is

292
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,440
ready bust a move oh yeah break it down break it down break it down

293
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,520
break it down break it down yeah yeah yeah yeah

294
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,120
spank that door open boom oh it hit me oh it just hit me back i'm beating the

295
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,680
store how dare you wait how did i do this

296
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,440
this is the worst wait what if we hit the microwave is that how we do it

297
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,920
oh it must be it must be smack interaction but how do you know what the mission

298
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:53,040
objective is i'm just smacking everything well

299
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,760
my hands are there's cars bumping out of here

300
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,320
what a unique game honestly i'm here for i'm here for it right i'm bringing the

301
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,800
grill oh wait no no i can't i was going to say

302
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,280
do i need to like open the grill in order to put it away

303
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,040
aren't huntsman spiders good to have around they might be

304
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,480
that's something a huntsman spider would say i'm being i'm gonna be honest

305
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,560
that was awfully suspicious of you that was awfully suspicious behavior but

306
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,040
they are a good to have around because they deal with the bugs

307
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,200
but um they are rather terrifying because

308
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,440
they don't actually sit like a regular

309
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,800
spider they sit like almost like a love heart if that makes sense because their

310
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,000
wee leggies are all crossed in on each other

311
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,400
so it makes some extra menacing especially considering like the biggest

312
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,880
spider in scotland is probably like five centimeters or

313
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,680
something like i have never seen anything of that nature until

314
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,160
summer first huntsman and he was such a cheeky shite because

315
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,880
um i think i must have been in my rental for about a week before he decided to

316
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,960
show up and i'm like where did you come from because all the windows and doors

317
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,960
like have those screens for bugs yeah um because in

318
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,040
scotland we actually don't have them so i was like oh my god this technology is

319
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,760
so advanced my my scottish brain cannot

320
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,680
comprehend how advanced this technology is

321
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,280
when i was a kid i'd always seen like american movies when the kids just like

322
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,000
sneak out of the house and they just like leave through the window and then when

323
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,880
is your fly screen yes we don't we don't have that in the

324
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,400

327
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:54,400
scotland and icky oh my god this is so cannot

328
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,680
you're coming with me i'm so determined to find one of like the

329
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,920
hidden things if i press start is it gonna tell us

330
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:10,240
no oh your game continues even when i pause on that end oh yeah okay that's

331
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,680
actually kind of good because it could not tell you how many games they code

332
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,960
where it's like oh what's that one person paused i will now

333
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,760
stop all of you from being able to progress uh i'm trying so badly to stack

334
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,280
these because i know when it comes to the later stuff i'm gonna mess up so

335
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,920
badly we've got it we've got to get our our puzzle

336
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:37,200
brains on and no i i cannot for the life of me i never played tetris before

337
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,640
i have played tetris but i've never been good at tetris

338
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,560
i used to watch speedruns of it on youtube randomly like i'd never played

339
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,000
it myself but i find it fascinating watching people like break world

340
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,640
records or that in video games and i used to watch

341
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,240
how does someone's brain like process shapes that

342
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,840
okay this is not we didn't need to move this uh we can bring it

343
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,040
stolen this yeah don't tell them don't tell them don't tell them

344
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,640
we'll we'll steal the okay wait so what we do we do the pivot moment yep

345
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,120
surely this will go fine and not be a problem at all

346
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,360
hold on let me get out of the way okay okay pivot

347
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,880
it's actually happening it's actually happening hold on right there we go

348
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,880
okay okay yeah that was a somehow a lot easier than i first

349
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,920
imagined shortcut

350
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,200
right through their house right through their lovely windows

351
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,840
see it wouldn't it wouldn't have happened if they had a fly screen so

352
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,520
not that i'm victim blaming or anything but if they had a fly screen i wouldn't

353
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,080
be able to do that why can i not yeah what is

354
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,560
wait does this not fit through the door i don't do we have to take this through

355
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,640
a window through the window through the wall to the wall

356
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:57,760
oh no mommy did it yeah okay we're doing it we're doing it that car is a bump

357
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,360
in that one over there we just don't steal it

358
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,440
let's see what happens a little grand theft oh oh how do i get stuck in the

359
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,040
door not only are we stealing this beach chair but we

360
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,880
think we it can't be proved okay we're just doing what we need to

361
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,600
oh there's a there's a there's a barrier

362
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,640
stinky that's that i'm throwing a flamingo at it

363
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,480

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,520
the clients were sick of always getting actual sand in their sandwiches

406
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:03,360
so they're headed for the countryside oh yeah yeah pools

407
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,920
wow since inventing the jump throw oh i can read it

408
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,400
sniffing strone's microphone no there'll be no sniffing microphones after emi's

409
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,920
recent ban i still can't believe that i don't know if you

410
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,080
now because you're a rat arissa uh you're not allowed to sniff on the

411
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,920
microphone because youtube literally gave her a strike

412
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,800
because she brought her rat on the mic i'm still speechless like

413
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,920
we tried to escalate it with the the youtube help and all that

414
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,880
and in the monetization tab and all that and they were like we got to the

415
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,240
highest chain of command that we could get and they were like

416
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,240
we understand it's a rat we're not removing it and it was like what

417
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,400
what are you on about you literally admitted that it's a rat

418
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,080
on the microphone is the reason she's got us like oh

419
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,600
anyway i shouldn't get into it because i'll start my blood pressure is rising

420
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,120
just thinking about it okay now remember pigs can't fly but

421
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,520
boxes can okay throw things to save time

422
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,360
are you sure pigs can't fly i met one that had

423
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,680
a pilot's license the other day that no no i didn't

424
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,680

439
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,000
we're learning

440
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,280
smack that parasol open oh maybe i feel like we are supposed to put them

441
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,440
in the sea somehow yeah i feel like there's definitely something we have to

442
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,280
do with him go over there okay that didn't work

443
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,040
go over there into the sea no what the heck right i'll just let him do his thing

444
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,400
down there we should maybe oh it's a slight door

445
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,360
oh there oh my god there there look they could oh okay okay this has to be it

446
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,800
this has to be it there's no way that we are reuniting him with his family

447
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,800
no what no come on please oh i'm so sorry how did he close the door on the

448
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,280
smack up against the door and it didn't work

449
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,840
oh i don't i'm sure it refills you're gonna know it just keep the crab just

450
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,960
keep him as a pet we'll just take him with us in the

451
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,800
the thing all the time can we go through like the

452
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,600
backyard me can you breathe no they're not

453
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,760
damn the game's no having a hmm i feel like

454
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,960
i oh god that door keeps stop closing jeez

455
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,760
oh it does look like we're supposed to give him back over

456
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,360
and i bet you when we finish it that it would be like the secret side mission

457
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:56,800
reunite the family and we're like bro we literally tried we tried hard

458
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,720
i'm putting this i don't know maybe we're to cook him i know that sounds really

459
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,160
morbid but like if we're not supposed to reunite the crab then

460
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,560
you know in front of his family

461
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,280
i mean this is what happens when you get lost you get kicked alive

462
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,640
mommy can we keep it i don't think we can keep it i don't know how to look

463
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,680
after a pet crab

464
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,240
i've been when i go get food for gimli and vego

465
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,040
they sell like painted kermit no can't not kermit what they called

466
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,760
those crabs with no not crab ah what they called

467
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,040
their shells are like painted oh no it is a hermit crab shells i used to have

468
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,320
them oh you had them yeah when i was a kid i had

469
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,760
fed hermit crabs oh my god how was it like keeping them

470
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,960
were they easy or i think i think they were easy but

471
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,560
mostly because i was a small child and i didn't really have to do much of the

472
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,160
work so i honestly don't know is that i can't remember looking after them

473
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,040
they lived a happy life that's the main thing

474
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,400
um yeah whenever i go to like the paint stores they've painted the backs of the

475
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,840
of them and i'm like i don't know i don't know if it's unhealthy but then again

476
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:16,080
they don't eat like their shell or anything like that so it's not

477
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,800
what i imagine anything oh how did i drop them

478
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:28,000
um but yeah they're very very unique bits i had a hamster

479
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:35,840
um but that was a terrible idea because um i also had cats in my childhood in the

480
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,840
hamsters the cats used to like watch them all the

481
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,000
time like as entertainment but luckily nothing happened but

482
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,280

584
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:58,160
premise is that like you get fired from your job and then someone leaves like a

661
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,240
could say smooth move success hinges on it

662
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,960
okay this job is about moving in just do what you normally do but backwards

663
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:54,240
backwards speak do we sure as long as you move everything from the truck to the right spot

Let's go and know it by default.

672
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:54,720
Ow, I keep getting myself for that rake as well.

673
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,080
Ow, I just thought, let's see.

674
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,400
OK, I can't pull it that way then.

675
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,760
I've got you, I've got you.

676
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,960
Me, me, pivot.

677
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,440
How have I made it go sideways?

678
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,040
Wait, it can't come in this way?

679
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,120
Can we, like, slap it?

680
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,520
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, slap it, all right.

681
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,760
When and don't give it a good slap, OK?

682
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,200
Yeah.

683
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,960
Right, what is it?

684
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,040
Oh, it's a grandfather clock.

685
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,160
My grandfather?

686
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,360
Aw, I like how the stepping stones in the garden is like a...

687
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:35,440
Oh, no, I thought it was a keyhole, but I guess not, maybe.

688
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,320
Oh, no, the clock is counting down because we're moving in.

689
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,120
Oh, the game's so mean.

690
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,440
Why would it do that to it?

691
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,880
How do I open this door?

692
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,800
The paint.

693
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,480
Wait, do we have to unlock sections of the house?

694
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,040
Oh, maybe.

695
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,600
Oh, my God, it may be you have to finish it room by room

696
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,080
and then it'll open up because...

697
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,000
Wait, I'm stuck.

698
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,880
No, there's a freaking window.

699
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,520
I need, you need to go all the way around again

700
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:10,440
in order to get access.

701
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,000
Oh, my goodness.

702
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,560
Oh, my goodness, Carly.

703
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:18,000
This game is getting a bit harder, I know where.

704
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,720
I can't believe it, I can't believe it.

705
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,280
I see this rake, I can't even pick it up.

706
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,760
I can't even pick it up.

707
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,200
I'm making it ten times worse.

708
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,920
Is there a broken window here?

709
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:31,840
Oh, that's what it is.

710
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,560
It's a window you can break into at the back.

711
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:36,040
Oh, wow.

712
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,480
Oh, God, they did not make it easy.

713
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,480
Sorry about the beat this hard out of nowhere.

714
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,640
I'm not smart enough for this kind of stuff.

715
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,280
Give me, give me, give me.

716
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,160
Some doors can only be opened from the side.

717
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,000
Oh, there may be sideway doors as well.

718
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,720
Oh, that honestly makes a lot more sense.

719
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,920
Now that you've said that out loud.

720
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,440
And this is why I allow stream sniping personally.

721
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:58,920
That's fair.

722
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,640
Oh, no, our backseat game in, I think,

723
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,440
is the terminology as well.

724
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,800
Why, what are your rules?

725
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,160
Are you a backseat gamer or are you a lover or are you like,

726
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,880
or let me try and figure it out first.

727
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:13,880
OK, I don't know how I want air.

728
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,320
OK, the computer's in place.

729
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,400
I'm doing it.

730
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,400
I'm getting paid.

731
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,000
I think I'm stuck at this room.

732
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,040
The window?

733
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,520
Yeah, it won't let me move this box out of here.

734
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,800
To get out.

735
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:32,360
Yeah, like, I can't, like, I can't take it through the window.

736
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,400
But I also, wait, hold on, let me come in.

737
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,920
Yeah, no, I don't think it's full of this room.

738
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,400
Let me, if I can get this chair over here, I'm coming.

739
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,160
I'll help, I'll help.

740
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,800
Help is on the way, dear.

741
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,920
Help is on the way.

742
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,240
We got this, we got this.

743
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,200
Can I come out in this part?

744
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,080
Right.

745
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:55,640
Right, we're going to take it through the room.

746
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:59,520
I said we're going to take it through the room.

747
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:03,520
And then we need to take it weird down here.

748
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,200
There we go, there we go.

749
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,840
And then, OK, so it is like you can go out,

750
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,320
but you can't go in.

751
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:18,000
Oh, my God, this is getting redunctious.

752
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,800
I actually love how Arissa's VTuber model looks.

753
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,360
It's very cute.

754
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,480
Wait until you see the actual model.

755
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,520
I can't wait for it.

756
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,360
I've asked her to, again, with the ring.

757
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,640
I've asked her to leak it.

758
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,960
Wait, where does this go?

759
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,120
Up top left.

760
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,680
Oh, my God.

761
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,000
OK, it's top left.

762
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,280
Let's go around the ring.

763
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,720
Yes, round the dang thing.

764
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,040
Around the other way.

765
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,480
Getting close.

766
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:55,600
No, I'm not even started.

767
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,040
Bro, I can't.

768
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,360
Right, there we go.

769
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,640
And then let us in this way.

770
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,560
Yes, OK, we're in, we're in.

771
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,920
We're in.

772
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,080
This is what we wanted.

773
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,040
This is what we've been waiting for.

774
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:08,720
Yeah.

775
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,240
OK, that was moved out the way.

776
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,480
Where does this ring go?

777
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,720
Ow.

778
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,560
You see this ring?

779
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,800
I keep forgetting its existence and it's ruining my life.

780
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,920
Not to be dramatic, but it's literally ruining my life.

781
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,840
Not to be dramatic, but it's evil and should die.

782
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,920
Yes, it will perish.

783
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,080
No, not even jump in this window?

784
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,840
Maybe we can't up the two people because I

785
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,800
couldn't draw another window before.

786
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,560
Oh, maybe.

787
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,760
OK, let's run.

788
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,920
Why does my character?

789
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,040
My character like sweeps when I do it that way.

790
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,240
No, go in.

791
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,040
That does seem that does seem right, though.

792
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:47,920
Oh, we did it.

793
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,480
Oh, thank you.

794
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,320
Ow, I forgot about the rape.

795
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,160
The absolute deviant of society.

796
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,320
Who knew it would be our biggest enemy in this game?

797
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,840
Oh, right, a shell.

798
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,240
How have we only got two minutes?

799
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:07,120
Sorry, this level is so hard for no reason.

800
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,160
They're like, oh, here's the easiest game in the world,

801
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:09,640
by the way.

802
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,200
OK, now we're going to make it insanely difficult out

803
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,080
of nowhere, like, oh, thank you, I guess.

804
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,560
We're so glad you thought that our game was cute and fun

805
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,040
and easy.

806
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,320
How would you feel about it not being that right now?

807
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,200
I don't know if we make it stressful out of nowhere.

808
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,680
Oh my god, how?

809
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,960
Right, OK, these boxes we can run away with each

810
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,000
because they're singular.

811
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,800
One in here.

812
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,640
Where does this one go?

813
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,400
Oh, this way.

814
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,080
OK, bink, bink, bad boom, bad boom, pow.

815
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,000
No.

816
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,920
And then we've got a desk.

817
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,080
OK, this is going to be a bit.

818
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,240
This is massive.

819
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,960
Bruh, who needs a desk this size?

820
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:54,960
Wait, Danny, wait.

821
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,000
If I go inside, can I open the doors for you?

822
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Oh, baby.

823
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,360
Oh, right, there he is.

824
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,000
OK, it's coming together.

825
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,440
It's coming together.

826
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,160
We're doing it.

827
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:04,880
I'm so smart.

828
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,640
This is why we get paid the big bucks for this job, OK?

829
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,840
I know you're.

830
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,640
I know, Reeflings, you can't comprehend

831
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,760
that we're worth so much money, but I assure you that we

832
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,240
take away the stress of what you.

833
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,880
All $40 billion we get paid every year

834
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,160
is 100% worth your taxpayer dollars.

835
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:22,680
Exactly.

836
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,920
And our prices don't include the personal tax

837
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,520
that you have to pay us.

838
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,600
I think we're going to have to.

839
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,160
Can we throw this thing?

840
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:28,600
Yeah, exactly.

841
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,640
We're going to throw it.

842
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:34,360
Unless OK, OK, OK, hold on.

843
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:34,800
Let me go.

844
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,480
It's giving me the the vibrati buzz thing.

845
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:42,480
So yeah, one, two, three.

846
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,480
Oh my god, that was perfect.

847
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,040
OK, I just lawless.

848
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:50,240
I literally just need to wiggle it over here and we're done.

849
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,480
OK, we're missing one.

850
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,720
Are we?

851
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,560
I'm getting an arrow this way.

852
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:58,440
Ah, the rig.

853
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,400
Oh, there you go, there you go.

854
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:00,960
Oh, I'll go.

855
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:01,680
I'll go.

856
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,200
No, I won't, no, I won't.

857
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:03,840
Hold on, hold on.

858
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,520
On the end, I'll open the door, open the door.

859
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,520
My lady.

860
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,920
See, this is this is my lady.

861
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,360
I forget to move.

862
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,920
And they see chivalry is there.

863
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,160
Exactly.

864
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,840
I throw it.

865
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,680
That was there we go.

866
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,040
Please.

867
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,240
I'm going to buy.

868
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:29,040
OK, moving in, complete a moving in level.

869
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:29,760
No sweat.

870
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,160
That was terrible.

871
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,720
The doors, I love that.

872
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,440
I love the bed.

873
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,360
We just need we just need to break it,

874
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,360
break on through to the other side.

875
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,640
Exactly.

876
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,960
This house is adorable.

877
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,960
OK, that's enough puns for this job.

878
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,720
Oh, adorable.

879
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,280
Oh, get it.

880
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:50,480
Hardy, hardy, hard, adorable, hardy, hardy, hardy, hardy.

881
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,480
And this is chivalry.

882
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,240
OK, that was curious.

883
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,040
The key the secret is key when you

884
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,240
got a go on the move.

885
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,200
I'm allergic to sliding doors.

886
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,640
Oh, I'm guess you can get the table in that window, I guess.

887
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,400
Oh, yeah.

888
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,760
Shocking the movie.

889
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,040
Shocking the movie.

890
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:19,880
We go across the bridge.

891
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:20,960
Hello.

892
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,040
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

893
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,760
I think I prefer the removal jobs.

894
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,080
Unless they make the moving jobs easier.

895
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,000
This is all going smoothly.

896
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,080
A whole day without a single conspiracy

897
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,520
or supermaterial incident.

898
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,400
The next job should be a piece of cake.

899
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,120
Are we about to get haunted?

900
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,280
I love being haunted.

901
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,120
Shame we don't get lunch breaks.

902
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,960
Or do we not?

903
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:47,920
Or dinner breaks.

904
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,760
Do they not feed us?

905
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,320
But we do break a lot of things.

906
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,160
So it pallets us out.

907
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,240
It makes the difference.

908
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,160
It makes the difference.

909
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,200
Chalet la fière.

910
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,040
I'm not even going to pretend I know what that means.

911
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,240
No, no French for me.

912
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,440
Not today, anyway.

913
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:09,920
This place just sold for a fortune.

914
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,520
Pack more house prices have gone through the roof.

915
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,280
Since we got voted town least likely to have a sloth

916
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,960
infestation, everyone wants to live here.

917
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,920
It's not even possible.

918
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:26,120
But we had a sloth infestation last year.

919
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,520
Yeah, so it's not very likely now.

920
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,600
OK, that's true.

921
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,080
True.

922
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,160
Sloth is so cute.

923
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,960
True.

924
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,360
Remember that thing?

925
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,880
What is that Australian meme about the co-op?

926
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:38,960
Is it drop bears?

927
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:39,680
Yeah, drop bears.

928
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:40,920
Yeah, I got fricken.

929
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:45,160
I got fooled into thinking it was a real thing.

930
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:45,840
It is real.

931
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:46,400
100%.

932
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

933
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,560
Someone is actually in Australia right now.

934
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,920
Yeah, yeah, drop bears.

935
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,080
And so are haggis.

936
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:59,040
Haggis reveal animals that you can only hunt during June

937
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,080
and August because that's when breeding season is.

938
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,080
And there are numbers get out of control if you don't.

939
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,080
Exactly.

940
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:07,680
I will see.

941
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,800
Unironically, though, last night at D&D.

942
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,520
My game has.

943
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:12,960
There we go.

944
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,240
OK.

945
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,200
Unironically, last night at D&D, there

946
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,680
was a koala outside my friend's house at night.

947
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,200
And they make such a horrible noise that we were like, OK,

948
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,280
so the drop bears are real.

949
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,120
And they're right there.

950
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,040
Honestly, they're terrifying.

951
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:29,080
That picture you see of the drop bear, the meme,

952
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:33,680
so for those of you who are uninitiated, why?

953
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,480
I'm making it worse.

954
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,480
I'm standing on the furniture.

955
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,360
How is this not?

956
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,520
Right, there we go.

957
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:43,600
For those of you uninitiated, OK,

958
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:47,720
there's a picture of a wet koala that looks absolutely

959
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:48,880
horrifying.

960
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,880
It is like hanging off of a tree.

961
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,800
It is the most terrifying thing.

962
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,760
No, do not grab the pot.

963
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:57,200
And it is like the most mortifying thing.

964
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,560
So Aussies call it a drop bear.

965
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:03,040
And my dumb ass thought it was real.

966
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:06,040
I thought it was a real animal because there's tons of animals

967
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,160
I've never seen before.

968
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:11,600
Like, it's like a marsupial type.

969
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,560
It's not kangaroo.

970
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,560
It was a.

971
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,560
Does it begin with a Q?

972
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,560
A quokka?

973
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:20,560
Possibly.

974
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:23,560
There's, like, tons of stuff I've never seen before.

975
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,560
Yeah.

976
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,560
So, like, I didn't question it.

977
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:29,560
I put my trust in the Aussies.

978
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,560
I put my faith in the Aussies.

979
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:37,560
And how do I get repaid by having that trust abused?

980
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:41,560
And by abused, I mean, I just believe a little tee hee thing.

981
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:44,560
It's kind of like when don't ever let a Scottish person tell you

982
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,560
that haggis are animals, by the way.

983
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:52,560
Haggis is literally just sheep, lungs, and intestines

984
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,560
all mashed up with a few spices, OK?

985
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,560
It's not an actual animal.

986
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,560
But if next time you hear me mention haggis,

987
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,560
I will say it's an animal just for the heck of it.

988
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:08,560
So, yes, I may have been a fool to the Aussies' drop bear.

989
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,560
Clean.

990
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:12,560
The funniest thing about the drop bear thing is that, you know,

991
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,560
we love to mess with people and tell people that the drop bear is real.

992
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:18,560
But, like, we kind of, that's kind of, we don't have to

993
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:21,560
because we have animals that are just that weird and real life.

994
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,560
Yes.

995
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,560
Like, we don't have to lie about having weird animals.

996
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,560
Exactly.

997
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,560
Exactly.

998
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:30,560
Like, if you've ever seen a kangaroo, they are horrifying,

999
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,560
but not for the reason you think.

1000
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:36,560
They're horrifying because they balance on their tails.

1001
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,560
It looks like their little tail is going to snap off

1002
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,560
because they put all the weight on it.

1003
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:44,560
And it is just the most bizarre thing.

1004
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,560
If you've ever seen a kangaroo, like, fight as well,

1005
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:50,560
those things are mortifying.

1006
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:56,560
There's, like, a viral video of this kangaroo having a dog in its arms or whatever.

1007
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:01,560
And then the owner comes up to the kangaroo, like, fill-grown kangaroo,

1008
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,560
and wallops them in the face.

1009
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:07,560
And the kangaroo is, like, stunned that he's been walloped in the face.

1010
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:11,560
It's just the most bizarre thing ever.

1011
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:15,560
But, like, they have, like, claws on their feet as well

1012
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:18,560
to, like, open up the guts of their enemies.

1013
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:22,560
Like, it's just craziness, honestly.

1014
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,560
Absolutely craziness.

1015
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:27,560
They're scary little creatures.

1016
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,560
They are mortifying little things.

1017
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:35,560
And they do just, like, hang out, like, in the suburbs and stuff, too.

1018
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:36,560
They're not just out in the wild.

1019
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,560
Sometimes you always be at the shop, so there's just one hanging out.

1020
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:43,560
Yeah, like, I'm very lucky that I haven't had to deal with encountering the wildlife.

1021
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:48,560
The most wildlife experience I have is, literally, I feed magpies,

1022
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,560
so I've never been swept by a magpie.

1023
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:54,560
They're all super happy when they call on me and that.

1024
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,560
It's really sweet, I love them.

1025
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:59,560
But I have been swept by those fake magpies,

1026
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:02,560
like, the smaller black and white ones swept me,

1027
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,560
and I was like, eh, excuse you.

1028
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:08,560
But there's still quite a lot of funny videos online

1029
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,560
of, like, kids getting swept by a magpie.

1030
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,560
There's one kid, he's, like, screaming down a hill,

1031
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,560
because he's terrified, and I feel so bad for laughing,

1032
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,560
but it is a wee bit funny.

1033
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,560
It's a wee bit funny.

1034
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:24,560
A couple weeks ago, some of my friends and I played pommel party,

1035
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,560
none of them are Australian, they're American and Canadian.

1036
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,560
So I, there was, in the game, one of the cosmetics you can get

1037
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,560
is, like, a bike helmet with spikes on it,

1038
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,560
and I was like, oh my god, my culture.

1039
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,560
And they were like, what are you talking about?

1040
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,560
And I said, oh, you know, the magpie helmets.

1041
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,560
And they were like, what are you saying?

1042
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,560
And I was like, you know, the helmets that you put on

1043
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,560
so you don't get attacked by magpies during swooping season,

1044
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,560
and they were like, there's a season?

1045
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,560
Yep, there is, absolutely.

1046
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,560
No, I got to learn about that too often.

1047
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,560
Out of the way!

1048
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,560
We could probably throw this across.

1049
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:00,560
Could we?

1050
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,560
Yeah, okay.

1051
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,560
Oh, we should do the couch first, because it's in the way.

1052
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,560
Okay.

1053
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:09,560
No, like, the people put, like, just, oh no, okay,

1054
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:12,560
one, two, three.

1055
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,560
Ah, fuck it, just send it, send it, send it.

1056
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,560
Yeah, close enough, close enough.

1057
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,560
Send everything, everything.

1058
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,560
Ring the cards.

1059
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:20,560
Hold on.

1060
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,560
One and two, just on two.

1061
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:23,560
Two, two.

1062
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,560
There we go.

1063
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,560
Okay, we're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it.

1064
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,560
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

1065
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:29,560
We're yapping too much, we're out of time.

1066
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:32,560
We're getting, our pee's going to get docked.

1067
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,560
Is it docked?

1068
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:37,560
Yeah, six at one and two.

1069
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,560
Right, okay, one more time.

1070
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:40,560
Hold on, give us another chance.

1071
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,560
One and two.

1072
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,560
Okay, that throw thing is actually a really fair mechanic.

1073
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,560
Sorry, that is really well done, they've done that.

1074
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,560
I guess we just walk out the door with this one.

1075
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:56,560
Just the, we did it.

1076
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,560
Right, okay, I'm satisfied we didn't mess this one up.

1077
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:00,560
Yeah.

1078
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:06,560
And then the fridge, the refrigerator.

1079
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:14,560
But yes, in order for magpies to stop swooping,

1080
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,560
people put like plastic spikes on their helmet

1081
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,560
or you can put zip locks on your helmet.

1082
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,560
Yeah, the zip ties are my favorite strategy.

1083
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:27,560
Yeah, or you can get, find a missing employee.

1084
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:28,560
Huh?

1085
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,560
The rat on the boat.

1086
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,560
I don't know, I don't think I'm missing employee.

1087
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:36,560
It's fishing.

1088
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,560
Smashed it, I love doing our part to keep property prices down.

1089
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:43,560
We should start a window company too.

1090
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,560
Actually we should.

1091
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,560
And maybe a broom company.

1092
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:50,560
I can see it happening.

1093
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,560
Just had a 14-hour work day.

1094
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,560
Oh no, I hope you're okay.

1095
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,560
Break all the windows, keep your...

1096
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,560
The one time we didn't.

1097
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:01,560
Literally.

1098
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,560
Character create.

1099
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,560
Kaku to you too buddy.

1100
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,560
I don't know what we did.

1101
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:11,560
The missing employee, can you help me find the rest of them?

1102
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:17,560
I invested all their wages and pictures of monkeys burning money.

1103
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:18,560
What?

1104
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,560
Is that a reference to something?

1105
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,560
They are going to be so half...

1106
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,560
Wait, is that a reference to the NFTs?

1107
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,560
I don't know.

1108
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,560
Monkeys burning money?

1109
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:30,560
That's the only thing my brain can come up with for a reference.

1110
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,560
Yeah.

1111
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,560
Refrigerator.

1112
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,560
Yeah I thought it was the NFTs too.

1113
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,560
Hello, my name is...

1114
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,560
Ah, the little testers!

1115
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,560
Is something burning?

1116
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:42,560
Oh, it's just me.

1117
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:43,560
I'm looking.

1118
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:47,560
Hats, toast, waffle, pizza and a poster?

1119
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,560
Is that right?

1120
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,560
I can't wait to unlock the air fryer character.

1121
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,560
Okay, hydration check.

1122
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,560
I need some water.

1123
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,560
Yeah, I'll hydrate too.

1124
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:06,560
This is a very good game.

1125
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,560
I'm very happy with that.

1126
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,560
It was so fun.

1127
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:10,560
Money will spend.

1128
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,560
It's on Xbox Game Pass right now.

1129
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,560
If anyone's curious, play with us.

1130
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:21,560
Hello, we're here to do the mission.

1131
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:22,560
Yeah.

1132
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,560
They say never work with animals.

1133
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,560
Excuse me, this coefficient rat is very polite.

1134
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,560
We've been nothing but nice.

1135
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,560
We've been as respectful as possible.

1136
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:32,560
What are you on about?

1137
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,560
Unless the animals...

1138
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:34,560
We're so good at our job.

1139
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:38,560
Yeah, unless the animals pay 27.3% more?

1140
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:42,560
Hang on, half of the smooth movers are animals.

1141
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,560
How dare you?

1142
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,560
How dare you?

1143
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,560
Are we getting hate crimes?

1144
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,560
Do we need support for HR?

1145
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,560
Hold on a minute, where's HR when you need them?

1146
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,560
They say pigs can't fly.

1147
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:56,560
What?

1148
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,560
What is this?

1149
01:12:58,560 --> 01:12:59,560
Who's come?

1150
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,560
Chickens can't fly either.

1151
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:07,560
Chickens can't fly as they don't have the required ratio of wing area to body mass.

1152
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:08,560
This...

1153
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:09,560
Oh, sorry.

1154
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,560
Your turn.

1155
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:17,560
This lack of appropriate wing loading means they are not able to generate required lift

1156
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:21,560
to launch themselves more than a very short distance.

1157
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:24,560
They can only launch a short distance?

1158
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,560
We can change that.

1159
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,560
Let's throw the chickens.

1160
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:34,560
We are prevailing the animals, but we're the sheep dog this time.

1161
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,560
Right, this is going to be serious.

1162
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,560
Right, sheep.

1163
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:40,560
Where does sheep go?

1164
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,560
She'd go up here.

1165
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,560
Sheep, in here.

1166
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:44,560
Wait, what?

1167
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,560
I need to...

1168
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,560
Ow!

1169
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,560
There's a shovel there, don't step on it.

1170
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:52,560
Wait, how do I put them in?

1171
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,560
Hold on, you guys are going to...

1172
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,560
Do we both have to do it?

1173
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,560
Like, throw them in?

1174
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:58,560
Yeah.

1175
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,560
Try...

1176
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,560
No, I think because he's only one, it's not...

1177
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,560
Yeah.

1178
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:04,560
Oh!

1179
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,560
I can...

1180
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:06,560
Okay, sorry.

1181
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,560
That was kind of...

1182
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:08,560
Sorry, my bad, Chief.

1183
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:09,560
It's solidified.

1184
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,560
Oh, he's golden.

1185
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:12,560
Yeah.

1186
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,560
Come here, chicken!

1187
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,560
Come here!

1188
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:19,560
Oh, did you know that a chicken in Australia is called a chook?

1189
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:20,560
Yeah!

1190
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,560
What a funny word.

1191
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:22,560
So, the live ones do.

1192
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,560
We just call them all chooks.

1193
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,560
Aw, I didn't know the live ones were called.

1194
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,560
I thought it was only the food when they...

1195
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,560
Yeah.

1196
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:30,560
Where they're...

1197
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,560
Why can I not grab a chicken?

1198
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,560
Chief, stay in here!

1199
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,560
This is...

1200
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,560
That's just my life as a bird, I don't know.

1201
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:36,560
It's just like that.

1202
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,560
Oh, you want birds?

1203
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,560
Yeah, I have a little cognac called Bandit.

1204
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,560
Oh, my God, Bandit!

1205
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,560
Such a perfect name!

1206
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,560
We Bandit!

1207
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,560
That's precious.

1208
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:50,560
He's a little menace, but I love him very much.

1209
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,560
Aw!

1210
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,560
Does he make loads of noises in the background?

1211
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,560
He does.

1212
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,560
He's actually learned how to do a kissy noise recently, which is adorable.

1213
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:59,560
Oh, my God!

1214
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:00,560
I love it!

1215
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,560
You'll need to send me a wee picture.

1216
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,560
Where does this turtle go?

1217
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:04,560
Does this turtle go anywhere?

1218
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,560
Or is this a distraction?

1219
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,560
I think the turtle's a distraction because...

1220
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:10,560
Yeah.

1221
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,560
Okay, do we want to try grab this cow?

1222
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,560
Yeah, actually.

1223
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:17,560
Let's deal with the cows because they're awkward.

1224
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,560
Is this a...

1225
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,560
Right, how...

1226
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,560
Wait.

1227
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,560
Okay, maybe...

1228
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,560
Oh, right, okay.

1229
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,560
We're doing it, we're doing it.

1230
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,560
There we go.

1231
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,560
And then that opened the post here.

1232
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:34,560
It looks like a...

1233
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:35,560
Yeah, okay, there we go.

1234
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,560
Yeah!

1235
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:37,560
Right, cows in, cows in.

1236
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:38,560
Get in here!

1237
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,560
Hold on.

1238
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,560
Get in there.

1239
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,560
There we go.

1240
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:44,560
All right, I'm assuming we're going to have to shut the door or it might escape.

1241
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:50,560
No, I think if it turns gold and then it's considered done because that chicken can jump out.

1242
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,560
But I think the game is being rather kind to us.

1243
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:57,560
No, no, no, no, no.

1244
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,560
Now you stay here, Mr. Cow.

1245
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:00,560
Yeah, open.

1246
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,560
You're getting corralled whether you like it or not.

1247
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,560
We need you for grazing.

1248
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,560
Actually, I'm...

1249
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,560
Oh, no!

1250
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:08,560
I'm on...

1251
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:09,560
This sounds bizarre.

1252
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:10,560
I'm on sheep.

1253
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,560
No, I'm on goat TikTok.

1254
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:15,560
And now you might be like, what on earth is that?

1255
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:18,560
This guy runs a grass-cutting business.

1256
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:19,560
Amazing.

1257
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:20,560
Amazing.

1258
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,560
But wait, the chickens are escaping.

1259
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:24,560
How?

1260
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,560
Oh, no.

1261
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:28,560
Oh, wait, they're climbing out of the things.

1262
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,560
How can we prevent that?

1263
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:31,560
We can.

1264
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,560
Oh, there's no...

1265
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,560
I mean, there are less animals on the field, but...

1266
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:41,560
Yeah.

1267
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:42,560
I'm not sure...

1268
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,560
The pigs can push the gate open!

1269
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:48,560
Oh, do we need to put the beehives?

1270
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,560
Maybe.

1271
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,560
I think so.

1272
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:52,560
Yeah.

1273
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:57,560
They don't perfectly run away, like, instantly, so...

1274
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:58,560
Maybe...

1275
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,560
Okay, so if the beehives aren't grabbable...

1276
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,560
No, how strange.

1277
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,560
Stay in here.

1278
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,560
And then don't give up.

1279
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,560
I mean, we're trying!

1280
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,560
Like, you're making it...

1281
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:14,560
This isn't the easiest...

1282
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,560
I think I need to put hay bales in the way.

1283
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,560
And that's what stops them.

1284
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:22,560
Right, I'm gonna just shove hay bales everywhere.

1285
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,560
Can you grab that hay bale?

1286
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,560
Nope, the hay bale.

1287
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:26,560
Oh, you know what?

1288
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:27,560
Grab the trough.

1289
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,560
Why not?

1290
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,560
I'll just jump over the fence.

1291
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,560
Okay, there you go.

1292
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,560
No!

1293
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:32,560
What?

1294
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,560
Come here!

1295
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,560
No way!

1296
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,560
That just happened!

1297
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:36,560
No way!

1298
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,560
Right in front of me.

1299
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:38,560
That just happened.

1300
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,560
This little guy's a regular Houdini.

1301
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:44,560
That was cheeky as any hen.

1302
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,560
Like, get that...

1303
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:47,560
Pig!

1304
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,560
Get over here!

1305
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,560
I'm gonna turn you into bacon at this rate.

1306
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,560
Okay, and then I'm gonna put that hay bale on top

1307
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:58,560
so we can escape.

1308
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,560
Right, and then I'm gonna jump over...

1309
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,560
Cause I can jump over, but they can't.

1310
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,560
Right, and then I'm gonna grab this chicken

1311
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,560
and then that's it done.

1312
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,560
Oh, looks like we're still missing a couple.

1313
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:11,560
Uh...

1314
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,560
Mr. Chicken!

1315
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,560
Stop it.

1316
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,560
Or I'll make you KFC at this rate.

1317
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,560
There's a pig over here!

1318
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:20,560
Oh, no!

1319
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,560
I got it with the shapes!

1320
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,560
Oh, I didn't even...

1321
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,560
Stay in there and don't come out.

1322
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:28,560
Come here.

1323
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,560
Can you be able to jump over with them?

1324
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,560
Yeah!

1325
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:32,560
Is this the last guy?

1326
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,560
And maybe the last one.

1327
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:35,560
It should?

1328
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:36,560
Oh, there's still one.

1329
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,560
There's still one left.

1330
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:38,560
Isn't the turtle?

1331
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,560
I don't...

1332
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:42,560
I didn't see a pen for the turtle.

1333
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,560
Okay, what are we missing?

1334
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,560
Oh, there's a sheep's escape.

1335
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,560
A sheep's escaped.

1336
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,560
I see him.

1337
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:51,560
I see him.

1338
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,560
If I can kangly get over.

1339
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,560
See you!

1340
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:56,560
Stop it!

1341
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,560
Get over.

1342
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:58,560
Oh, my God!

1343
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,560
I don't know how we did that.

1344
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,560
That was a very unique map.

1345
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:07,560
I love the smell of animals in the morning.

1346
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,560
Sorry, I forgot to share it again.

1347
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,560
No, that's real!

1348
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:12,560
What the heck?

1349
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:14,560
I'm such a stinky streamer.

1350
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,560
Not the game calling me out.

1351
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,560
I'm so stinky all the time.

1352
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,560
The game knows.

1353
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,560
The game is enforcing you into the greasy girl stereotype.

1354
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,560
Oh, literally.

1355
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,560
Fair of one maxing.

1356
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,560
Your fart level is now number two,

1357
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:32,560
and I'm going to resist the obvious joke here.

1358
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,560
Not the bees!

1359
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,560
I don't know what the bee one was all about.

1360
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,560
Maybe we...

1361
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:40,560
I feel like if we...

1362
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,560
Maybe if we slapped the bee hive, they would attack us.

1363
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,560
I don't know.

1364
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:47,560
Yeah, I'd believe that.

1365
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:50,560
We're going to the farm next door.

1366
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,560
What's that?

1367
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:57,560
Right, I think this might be our cheeky last one,

1368
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,560
so we need to make a count.

1369
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:02,560
We're at the greatest of all time map, the goat map.

1370
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,560
Looks like we didn't use enough animal puns or facts yet.

1371
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:08,560
It's time for another animal move.

1372
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,560
Get moving!

1373
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:16,560
Let's go.

1374
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:17,560
Be careful.

1375
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:21,560
These goats think they are the greatest of all time.

1376
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,560
Okay, so...

1377
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:24,560
Oh, there's rams?

1378
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:25,560
Do we need to worry about...

1379
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,560
No, the rams aren't a part of it.

1380
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,560
Okay, this does not look easy.

1381
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,560
I'm not...

1382
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,560
I'm getting nervous.

1383
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,560
I'm getting shaky, okay?

1384
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,560
Me too.

1385
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,560
What are we supposed to do?

1386
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,560
Oh my god, these rams are perfect!

1387
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,560
Oh no!

1388
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:46,560
And then where do you go?

1389
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,560
Do we put the kettle over...

1390
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,560
Right, first piggy, go.

1391
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:54,560
No, go there and don't jump over.

1392
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,560
Do you understand me?

1393
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,560
Don't be a naughty piggy!

1394
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,560
Oh, I see, okay.

1395
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,560
Just everything, absolutely everything is thrown in here.

1396
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,560
It looks like they don't jump out, which...

1397
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,560
Oh, the rakes!

1398
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,560
They can't attack you if you grab them.

1399
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:12,560
Oh, the rams?

1400
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,560
Yeah.

1401
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,560
Oh, okay, okay.

1402
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:18,560
Not bad.

1403
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,560
Got it.

1404
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,560
I'll hold on to this guy and keep it away from you.

1405
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,560
Oh my god, yeah, literally.

1406
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,560
I do need him to ram me.

1407
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:30,560
Not ram me, but ram the fence.

1408
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,560
Oh, he's missing!

1409
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,560
No, you silly goober.

1410
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,560
Come here.

1411
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:36,560
Here.

1412
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,560
Judge.

1413
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:38,560
Aim for us.

1414
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,560
Judge.

1415
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:40,560
Literally, aim for us.

1416
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,560
Oh, damn it.

1417
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:42,560
Oh, okay, we got one.

1418
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,560
Well, the AI definitely stepped up to do that

1419
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,560
because he was not aiming for there.

1420
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,560
Thank you, AI.

1421
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:49,560
I appreciate it, Game Devs.

1422
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,560
Judge, out.

1423
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:55,560
We're so thankful for you being so kind to us.

1424
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:59,560
And this is why there's a moving out too,

1425
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:02,560
because the devs were so smart to do that.

1426
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:03,560
Yeah.

1427
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:04,560
Ow!

1428
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:05,560
There's a shovel there.

1429
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,560
Wait, the shovel's there too?

1430
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:08,560
Not just three?

1431
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,560
Yeah.

1432
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:11,560
I got hit by one before too.

1433
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,560
Oh, yeah.

1434
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:14,560
Yoink.

1435
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:15,560
Can you...

1436
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:16,560
Yoink.

1437
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:17,560
Here.

1438
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:19,560
Break this one, because we...

1439
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:20,560
Here.

1440
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,560
Mr. Ram.

1441
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:22,560
Come here, come here, come here.

1442
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:23,560
He literally walks away.

1443
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:24,560
He couldn't give less.

1444
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:25,560
Well, but...

1445
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,560
He does not want...

1446
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,560
He realized that ramming stuff is helpful to us

1447
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,560
and immediately decided not to do it.

1448
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:31,560
I've had enough.

1449
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,560
Come on.

1450
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:33,560
Come on.

1451
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:34,560
Okay.

1452
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,560
More?

1453
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:37,560
Oh my God, there's so many.

1454
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,560
One wasn't enough.

1455
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:41,560
Come here, come here, come here.

1456
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,560
I actually can't reach him.

1457
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:44,560
No!

1458
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:45,560
Ow!

1459
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:49,560
I was out of the way and then he spun and hit me anyway.

1460
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:50,560
I'm like...

1461
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:51,560
Can I smack him?

1462
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:52,560
Yes.

1463
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,560
Okay.

1464
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:55,560
Okay, okay.

1465
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,560
And then we need to do it one more time.

1466
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:58,560
Smack.

1467
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,560
Okay, if we smack him, it aggravates him.

1468
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:01,560
Oh, I didn't realize.

1469
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,560
Okay, wait, that's a slidey.

1470
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:04,560
Okay, spank.

1471
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:05,560
Come here, come here, come here.

1472
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,560
Okay, we can spank him to annoy him.

1473
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:08,560
No!

1474
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,560
Ow!

1475
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:10,560
Aw, freaking...

1476
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,560
Wake up, Mr. Ram.

1477
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:12,560
And then hit the...

1478
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:13,560
I'll hold the door open.

1479
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:14,560
No, Mr. Ram!

1480
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,560
Where are you?

1481
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:16,560
Come here!

1482
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:17,560
Right, if you hold the door.

1483
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:18,560
Spank.

1484
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:19,560
No, spank.

1485
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:22,560
All right, and then I am the red door.

1486
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:23,560
Oh, yeah!

1487
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:25,560
Come here, Mr. Cow.

1488
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:28,560
I like how he's eating that hot dog as we draw.

1489
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,560
That is so cute.

1490
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:33,560
No, Mr. Ram, not now.

1491
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,560
Some of us...

1492
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:36,560
No, Mr. Sheep!

1493
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:37,560
Ow!

1494
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,560
I've made a horrible choice!

1495
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:39,560
We've...

1496
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:40,560
Mistakes were made.

1497
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:44,560
Right, as long as the cow is getting in, we'll just toss the cow over next time.

1498
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,560
If we get another one.

1499
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,560
Okay, that's close.

1500
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,560
That's fine.

1501
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:48,560
All right, that...

1502
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,560
Okay, that's close.

1503
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:50,560
That's all that matters.

1504
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,560
Okay, I can grab the chickens over here now.

1505
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,560
You!

1506
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:54,560
Get over here!

1507
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,560
All accumulated in this corner.

1508
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,560
Knock it off.

1509
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:01,560
Some of us have a quota to meet.

1510
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:04,560
Some of us have business to do.

1511
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,560
Literally, trying to get business.

1512
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,560
Is that everything broken?

1513
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:15,560
No, you, Mr. Ram, come go there, get spanked, and then break this.

1514
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:16,560
There.

1515
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,560
Right, now go away.

1516
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,560
Mr. Cow, you're coming with me.

1517
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,560
I almost said speaking of Ram.

1518
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,560
Google Chrome is stealing my Ram.

1519
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:28,560
Honestly.

1520
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:29,560
Failed that.

1521
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:30,560
That's so real.

1522
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:34,560
You need to download more dedicated wham.

1523
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:35,560
Okay.

1524
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:39,560
Yeah, I thought of a name that Chad can call me.

1525
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:43,560
So, I saw some people saying Auntie, like Auntie Arisa.

1526
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,560
I think Aunt Risa is fun.

1527
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:46,560
Aunt Risa?

1528
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:47,560
Yeah.

1529
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:50,560
Aw, that's so sweet.

1530
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,560
Mommy and Aunt Risa.

1531
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,560
Ow!

1532
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:55,560
Sorry.

1533
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,560
Now Mr. Cow can come with me.

1534
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:06,560
We'll just toss them over the wee fence thing because he is going to be a nightmare.

1535
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:10,560
If we open up that patio thing again.

1536
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:15,560
All right, grab, and then hold, and then we'll grab that one.

1537
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:19,560
Why are all the chickens getting out of us and stop it?

1538
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,560
Come here, let's just take them.

1539
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:22,560
Put you together.

1540
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,560
Okay.

1541
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:24,560
Employee of the day.

1542
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:25,560
We didn't even do anything.

1543
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:28,560
I like how there's this crash spaceship to the right.

1544
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,560
That's your first day complete.

1545
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:34,560
We even had less complaints calls than usual.

1546
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,560
That's because we're working outside on a farm.

1547
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:41,560
This is the first day of the rest of our fart lives.

1548
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:42,560
Exactly.

1549
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:46,560
Should be smooth fart sailing from here.

1550
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,560
Fart sailing, that sounds fun.

1551
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,560
New game from SMG.

1552
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,560
That's the name of the studio.

1553
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,560
They're called SMG Studio, so this is good.

1554
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,560
Oh my God.

1555
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:02,560
Whatever happens, we're real farts, and no one can ever take that away from us.

1556
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,560
Exactly.

1557
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:04,560
Bring on Datu.

1558
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:10,560
I'm ready for literally anything, no matter how weird, bizarre, or supernatural it is.

1559
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,560
Good news, everyone.

1560
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:17,560
It's getting late, but head back to HQ without breaking anything for a surprise.

1561
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:22,560
Right, we'll go to HQ, see what's up, and then...

1562
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:23,560
I think.

1563
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,560
I mean, I think it's good.

1564
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,560
Pass time.

1565
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,560
Cows first.

1566
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:28,560
Oh no, bad goat.

1567
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,560
Don't let a goat stun you and deliver the goats.

1568
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:32,560
We did deliver the goats.

1569
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,560
We pulled the goats in the truck.

1570
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,560
Ah, we're so sleepy.

1571
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,560
Oh.

1572
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:47,560
Oh, okay.

1573
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:49,560
I mean, I guess that doesn't...

1574
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:57,560
Whoa, I've never been to the HQ at night before.

1575
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:00,560
I hope this means we don't have to stop working once it gets dark.

1576
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,560
Oh no.

1577
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:04,560
Why sleep when we can move?

1578
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:07,560
Quickly, now, unload the surprise from the truck.

1579
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:08,560
Okay.

1580
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:14,560
I found a way to make our lives easier.

1581
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,560
It's called a computer.

1582
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:19,560
Ah, it's a computer.

1583
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:25,560
This baby will make smooth moves 90% more efficient, with 90% less employees.

1584
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:26,560
Oh no.

1585
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:29,560
Careful, it's one of a kind.

1586
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:31,560
Okay, we're careful.

1587
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:34,560
You don't know how hard it was to find this.

1588
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,560
I feel like he's stolen it from somewhere.

1589
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:39,560
All you need to know is that we'll make moving anything a breeze.

1590
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:41,560
What could go wrong?

1591
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:46,560
Move it into position and let's get going.

1592
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:47,560
Oh my god.

1593
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,560
We have platforms now.

1594
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,560
This is...

1595
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:53,560
Sorry, this game is so adorable.

1596
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,560
I love this.

1597
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:58,560
I don't know, can I go...

1598
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,560
I think I can go up to four players as well.

1599
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,560
And just the floor button.

1600
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,560
Oh.

1601
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:06,560
Oh.

1602
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:08,560
Okay, good.

1603
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,560
Now to do some super high tech stuff.

1604
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:11,560
Ah, yes, it's working.

1605
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:13,560
I told them it'd be fine.

1606
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:14,560
Eh?

1607
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:16,560
Uh-oh.

1608
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:17,560
Oh no.

1609
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:18,560
Oh no.

1610
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,560
We're unlocking the campaign mode.

1611
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:23,560
No, no, no, no, no.

1612
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:25,560
Oh god, our boss got sucked in.

1613
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:29,560
How are we going to make money if our boss is so young?

1614
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:30,560
Oh no.

1615
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,560
We arranged all the jobs for us.

1616
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,560
We don't have to deal with anything.

1617
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,560
What did you...

1618
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:37,560
Why don't we get our paycheck?

1619
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:38,560
I know, I was actually...

1620
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,560
Did I still get my pension?

1621
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:41,560
What happened to that?

1622
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:43,560
What did you do?

1623
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,560
You've stolen our inter...

1624
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,560
No mention on Gateway.

1625
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:53,560
And littered the multiverse with burn at your boxes.

1626
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:54,560
Whoops.

1627
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:56,560
Our badge.

1628
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,560
You need to clean up this mess.

1629
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,560
And save our boss?

1630
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,560
Uh, sure.

1631
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:05,560
That too, whatever.

1632
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,560
Oh my god.

1633
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,560
That's so cute.

1634
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:16,560
You need to travel to each of these dimensions.

1635
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,560
Oh, I skipped something there by accident.

1636
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:19,560
Some are good.

1637
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,560
Some aren't that good.

1638
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:26,560
There's 12 reasonably skilled tech gnomes out there.

1639
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,560
Bro, to help you repair the portal,

1640
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,560
but you'll have to find them first.

1641
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,560
You'd love.

1642
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:33,560
They'll probably need it.

1643
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:35,560
Hey, while they're doing that,

1644
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:37,560
should we go get a hot dog or something?

1645
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:38,560
I'm starving.

1646
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:40,560
Oh my god.

1647
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:42,560
What an adorable little game.

1648
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,560
That...

1649
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:45,560
So cute.

1650
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:46,560
I literally can't get over that.

1651
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:47,560
And we've just...

1652
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:50,560
That's just gone past the tutorial mode, technically.

1653
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,560
Because we've unlocked the campaign,

1654
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,560
which is we need to save our boss.

1655
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:57,560
From inter-dimensional moving around.

1656
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,560
But I thoroughly enjoyed that.

1657
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:01,560
That was fantastic.

1658
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,560
That was lovely.

1659
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:06,560
Thank you so, so much, Erisa, for hanging out with me.

1660
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:07,560
That was a blast.

1661
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:08,560
That was so good.

1662
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:09,560
Thanks for having me.

1663
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:12,560
For you little reeflings that are lurking in the shadows,

1664
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,560
I have linked Erisa's Twitter.

1665
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,560
She is debuting soon to end.

1666
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:22,560
I don't have a date yet, but I've demanded.

1667
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,560
I said, Erisa, as soon as you get a debut date,

1668
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:26,560
you give it.

1669
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:27,560
I want on my table.

1670
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:28,560
I want on my table instantly.

1671
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:31,560
Because we are very much likely going to do a watch along.

1672
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:32,560
Or a readout.

1673
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,560
It's on Twitch.

1674
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:34,560
You use Twitch?

1675
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:36,560
I'll be doing it on YouTube,

1676
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,560
but then I'll be mostly streaming off of that.

1677
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:39,560
Okay, okay.

1678
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:40,560
If you do it on YouTube, then I can read out.

1679
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,560
I can also redirect at a later point.

1680
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,560
Or whatever.

1681
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:45,560
But yes, already following her.

1682
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:46,560
That's a good reefling.

1683
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:47,560
That's what I want to see.

1684
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,560
But yes, Erisa...

1685
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:54,560
Erisa is the mastermind behind all the shorts on my channel.

1686
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,560
She's absolutely fantastic.

1687
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:57,560
Lovely debut.

1688
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:58,560
Very soon to end.

1689
01:30:58,560 --> 01:30:59,560
All the assets are here.

1690
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:02,560
And I'll leak anything as soon as she leaks it to me.

1691
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,560
So don't you worry reeflings.

1692
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:05,560
I'll keep you up to date.

1693
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:07,560
I'll keep you up to date because I can't stop myself.

1694
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:10,560
I just get so excited for future stuff for everyone.

1695
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:11,560
Okay.

1696
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:12,560
I can't help it.

1697
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,560
I don't want to spoil the fun in that way.

1698
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,560
Yes, thank you so, so much.

1699
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:22,560
What I'm going to do, Erisa, is I'm going to leave the voice call.

1700
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,560
And then I'm going to wrap it up with my reeflings.

1701
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:29,560
And thank you so, so much for having a goof off with me on this game.

1702
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:30,560
It's so cute.

1703
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:31,560
Thanks for having me.

1704
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:32,560
I had so much fun.

1705
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,560
I had so much fun too.

1706
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:34,560
Is there anything you want to say?

1707
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,560
Or you want to plug yourself?

1708
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,560
Even though I technically just did it.

1709
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:41,560
Yeah.

1710
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:44,560
I guess all my socials, same ad as my Twitter.

1711
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:46,560
So you'll be able to find me.

1712
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,560
Erisa and Anish everywhere.

1713
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,560
And not to brag or anything.

1714
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,560
But I'm pretty sure when Erisa starts streaming,

1715
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,560
she's going to have the best shorts out there.

1716
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:00,560
Just my bias opinion, but it's kind of true.

1717
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:01,560
It's kind of true.

1718
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:06,560
But yes, I will leave the call and wrap up the stream.

1719
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,560
But thank you so, so much, Erisa.

1720
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:09,560
That was an absolute blast.

1721
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:11,560
Thank you for hanging out with me.

1722
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:12,560
I really appreciate it.

1723
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,560
And I'll talk to you later, okay?

1724
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:15,560
Yeah.

1725
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:17,560
Bye, Ani, Erisa.

1726
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:19,560
Bye, Erisa, bye.

1727
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:22,560
Oh, that was a hoot.

1728
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:23,560
Hold on, let me send a little love heart.

1729
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:25,560
Oh my gosh.

1730
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,560
That was so cute.

1731
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,560
What a lovely game as well.

1732
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:32,560
That was a hoot and holler.

1733
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:33,560
I'm so sorry, right?

1734
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:34,560
Hold on, let me...

1735
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,560
Thank you, tiny, spainy, anonymous,

1736
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,560
and blatant, riefling, senpai.

1737
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,560
My apologies.

1738
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,560
I didn't mean to...

1739
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,560
Ani, Erisa is gone.

1740
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,560
Yum!

1741
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,560
That was so fucking cute.

1742
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:51,560
I thoroughly enjoyed that.

1743
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:52,560
That was lovely.

1744
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:55,560
I passed out, basically,

1745
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:57,560
after my wee stream disease,

1746
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:59,560
and then I woke up,

1747
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:00,560
and we got into a voice call,

1748
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:01,560
and I was just blabbing away

1749
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:02,560
to her and being like,

1750
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:03,560
oh, what's going on, you?

1751
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:04,560
What's going on?

1752
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:05,560
Are you squiddling me right now?

1753
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:06,560
Brack...

1754
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:08,560
Brack...

1755
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,560
Bratchy strikes.

1756
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:12,560
That's it, you're getting

1757
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,560
assigned a new gamertag by me, okay?

1758
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:15,560
Your new gamertag

1759
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:17,560
is Pikachu eating a hot pocket.

1760
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:19,560
Okay, that's your new gamertag.

1761
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,560
Bratchy strikes.

1762
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:22,560
That's the only way

1763
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,560
my brain is reading it.

1764
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:25,560
I'm so sorry.

1765
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:26,560
Thank you for becoming a member.

1766
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,560
Please enjoy your emote as well.

1767
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,560
I'm getting new emote soon too.

1768
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:33,560
That was a hoot and holler.

1769
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:34,560
I love that.

1770
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:36,560
Please don't be surprised

1771
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:37,560
if you see me missing

1772
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,560
with Erisa again.

1773
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,560
My redirect didn't work.

1774
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,560
Shebe's playing Hayes!

1775
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,560
I can redirect into her twice

1776
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:49,560
technically, even though

1777
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:50,560
I don't think it worked

1778
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:51,560
the last stream for some reason.

1779
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:52,560
My redirects have been

1780
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,560
very broken as of late.

1781
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,560
I'm not sure what

1782
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:56,560
the dealio was that is.

1783
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,560
I really am not...

1784
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,560
causing a yep pass out for sure.

1785
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:01,560
I didn't!

1786
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:04,560
I promised I didn't do anything.

1787
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:07,560
I'm literally going to go for a bath,

1788
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:08,560
and then I'm going to get

1789
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,560
my tripod out.

1790
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:13,560
Enjoyed your walk after the first...

1791
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:15,560
I didn't do anything!

1792
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:17,560
I had a nap, okay?

1793
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:18,560
I had a nap.

1794
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:20,560
You should breath.

1795
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:21,560
I've been buggy today.

1796
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:22,560
Yeah, literally.

1797
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:25,560
It does save for me redirecting

1798
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,560
to Hayes part two

1799
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,560
for Shebe cutting bin,

1800
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:29,560
but whether or not

1801
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:30,560
it's actually working

1802
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:31,560
is a whole different story.

1803
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:33,560
As for tomorrow's agendination,

1804
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:35,560
we are playing a game

1805
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:36,560
called Vermintite 2.

1806
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:37,560
You can stream Snake Man.

1807
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:38,560
I'm going to have a

1808
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:39,560
throwaway steam account,

1809
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:41,560
which I use for stream sniping.

1810
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:43,560
So I will add you on it,

1811
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,560
but I highly recommend

1812
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:47,560
you do not add me

1813
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:48,560
if it has your actual name

1814
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:49,560
and details on it.

1815
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,560
Please use gamer tags.

1816
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:52,560
Please protect yourself.

1817
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,560
Please be super safe.

1818
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,560
And make...

1819
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,560
make do...

1820
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:01,560
If you need a gamer tag,

1821
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:02,560
literally just call yourself

1822
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,560
360 no scope default,

1823
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,560
most generic thing you can.

1824
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:07,560
Please be super safe,

1825
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,560
because I will add you on steam.

1826
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:10,560
And if you have your profile

1827
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:11,560
set to like,

1828
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:12,560
I can see your friends list

1829
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:13,560
or whatever, you know,

1830
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:15,560
I don't know, just be safe.

1831
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:16,560
I will be deleting everyone

1832
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:17,560
at the end of the stream.

1833
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:20,560
If you do not play

1834
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,560
Vermintite,

1835
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:24,560
you do not have to get

1836
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:25,560
the game to stream snake me.

1837
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,560
We will be playing

1838
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,560
plenty of other stream snake stuff.

1839
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:30,560
What do I need to do

1840
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,560
for Vermintite?

1841
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:33,560
One, open your wallet.

1842
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:35,560
Two, add me on steam,

1843
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:36,560
but I'm going to make a steam account

1844
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:37,560
for stream sniping things,

1845
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,560
because I personally

1846
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:41,560
really like stream sniping.

1847
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:43,560
And it's what I want to do, okay?

1848
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,560
I want to stream snake.

1849
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:46,560
I'm not allowed to stream snake.

1850
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:47,560
Why am I cut off?

1851
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:49,560
I'm not allowed to stream snake.

1852
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,560
I like stream sniping.

1853
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:54,560
But yeah,

1854
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:55,560
don't buy the game

1855
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:56,560
if it's not for you,

1856
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:57,560
just to stream snake.

1857
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:59,560
We will play plenty of more accessible,

1858
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:01,560
free to play shenanigans

1859
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:03,560
and stuff that we'll get up to, okay?

1860
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:05,560
The good news is,

1861
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:06,560
Darktide has crossed me.

1862
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:07,560
I know,

1863
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:08,560
I'm Darktide.

1864
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:09,560
I'm Vermintide.

1865
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:10,560
Vermintide.

1866
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:13,560
That's what we're doing.

1867
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:15,560
But yeah,

1868
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:16,560
that was a lovely, cosy stream.

1869
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:17,560
I'm now going to do

1870
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:19,560
inappropriate things,

1871
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:21,560
wildly inappropriate things.

1872
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:23,560
He he he he.

1873
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:25,560
But yes,

1874
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:26,560
I will redirect

1875
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,560
into she be...

1876
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:29,560
I'm not going to stall

1877
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:31,560
because I do have to make up

1878
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:32,560
to you,

1879
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:33,560
my little reefling.

1880
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,560
Is the wrist still in game?

1881
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:38,560
I'm checking

1882
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:39,560
if she's still in game with me.

1883
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:40,560
I'm going to ask her to...

1884
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:41,560
I'm honking the car.

1885
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:42,560
This is me.

1886
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:45,560
If she honks back,

1887
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:46,560
I'll laugh.

1888
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:47,560
No,

1889
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:48,560
I think she's dead.

1890
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:49,560
She's gone.

1891
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:52,560
How long do you plan

1892
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:53,560
to play Vermintide for?

1893
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:54,560
I can probably do

1894
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:55,560
like a solid

1895
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,560
five hours of Vermintide.

1896
01:36:58,560 --> 01:36:59,560
It will probably be

1897
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:00,560
my longest stream this week

1898
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:01,560
on Ironic Clue.

1899
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:03,560
I just adore stream sniping.

1900
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:04,560
I do.

1901
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:05,560
It just,

1902
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:06,560
it makes me so happy

1903
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,560
that I can play with you.

1904
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:08,560
And

1905
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:09,560
um,

1906
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:10,560
um,

1907
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:11,560
oh my God,

1908
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:12,560
Trani,

1909
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:13,560
you're such a simp.

1910
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,560
Yeah,

1911
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:15,560
so what?

1912
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:16,560
I'm a simp for reeflings.

1913
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:17,560
What are you going to do about it?

1914
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:18,560
I want to take your ink.

1915
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:19,560
I want to play games with you.

1916
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:20,560
And I want to have a good time.

1917
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:21,560
Psh,

1918
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:22,560
show me.

1919
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:23,560
Show me.

1920
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:25,560
So yes,

1921
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:26,560
I will do the thing

1922
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:27,560
where I write down

1923
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:28,560
everyone's name

1924
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:29,560
and then

1925
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:30,560
if we've cycled through

1926
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,560
everyone who is eligible to play,

1927
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:33,560
we'll just start up

1928
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:34,560
new lobbies, okay?

1929
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:35,560
So

1930
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:36,560
that's the plan.

1931
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:38,560
That's the plan, Batman.

1932
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:41,560
As reeflings are sent for you to a moment.

1933
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,560
Maybe we should kiss you

1934
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:44,560
or something.

1935
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:48,560
I can't join,

1936
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:49,560
sadly,

1937
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:50,560
to protect Momay from the rats.

1938
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:51,560
Reeflings?

1939
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:52,560
Oh, don't worry.

1940
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:54,560
Trani, let's do.

1941
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:55,560
By the way,

1942
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:56,560
Momay,

1943
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:57,560
if you're on a new account,

1944
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:58,560
you only have access

1945
01:37:58,560 --> 01:37:59,560
to the baby difficulty.

1946
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:00,560
Oh, no.

1947
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:04,560
I can't play legendary mode.

1948
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:05,560
Oh, dear.

1949
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:06,560
Oh, dear.

1950
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:09,560
Oh, such as a tragedy,

1951
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:10,560
little reefling.

1952
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,560
Oh, no.

1953
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,560
I have to play the easy mode.

1954
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:15,560
So we get to play

1955
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:17,560
and I don't get frustrated.

1956
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:18,560
I think,

1957
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:19,560
oh,

1958
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:20,560
shucks.

1959
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:21,560
I can't believe her.

1960
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:22,560
Oh,

1961
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:23,560
brass and brass and dictast.

1962
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,560
I'll,

1963
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:26,560
it's okay.

1964
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:27,560
I am going to try

1965
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:28,560
and play it a little bit

1966
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,560
offline after I have

1967
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:32,560
posted a few things

1968
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:33,560
and done a few things.

1969
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:36,560
Oh,

1970
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:37,560
it's such a tragedy.

1971
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:40,560
Mommy, no,

1972
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:41,560
Mommy, don't go.

1973
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:42,560
But if I go,

1974
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,560
you get pictures.

1975
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:45,560
I'm going to get a bath

1976
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:46,560
to relax

1977
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,560
and I'm going to get all

1978
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:49,560
hairless

1979
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:50,560
and smooth

1980
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:51,560
and oiled up.

1981
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:54,560
I mean,

1982
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:55,560
other things follow

1983
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:56,560
things.

1984
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:57,560
After the pictures,

1985
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:58,560
I'm going to wait

1986
01:38:58,560 --> 01:38:59,560
a whole 30 minutes.

1987
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:00,560
Okay.

1988
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:01,560
And whatever

1989
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:02,560
is in my marshmallow.

1990
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:04,560
Oh,

1991
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:07,560
yes,

1992
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:08,560
I'm going to redirect

1993
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:09,560
into Sheepsters.

1994
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:10,560
Please be

1995
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:11,560
deliciously

1996
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:12,560
kind to

1997
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:14,560
our beloved rabbit.

1998
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:16,560
As always,

1999
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:17,560
and I will

2000
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:19,560
see you

2001
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:20,560
very

2002
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:21,560
shortly.

2003
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:23,560
Hmm.

2004
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:25,560
Hmm.

2005
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:28,560
Love you,

2006
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:29,560
replay.

2007
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:32,560
Okay.

2008
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:33,560
You enjoy.

2009
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:34,560
You're not even

2010
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:35,560
let Riecklin shave you.

2011
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:37,560
I don't know if your

2012
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:38,560
technicals are too slimy

2013
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:39,560
to trust with a razor blade.

2014
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:41,560
I feel like

2015
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:42,560
you've got stab resistance

2016
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:43,560
because of the slime.

2017
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:45,560
Mommy,

2018
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:46,560
shave an ASMR.

2019
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,560
I mean,

2020
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:48,560
I'll record it

2021
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:49,560
if you want to shave

2022
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:50,560
an ASMR.

2023
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:51,560
Yeah.

2024
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:52,560
Okay.

2025
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:53,560
Right.

2026
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:54,560
I'm going to not stall

2027
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:55,560
because I'm going to

2028
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:56,560
relax in the bath.

2029
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:57,560
As I said,

2030
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:58,560
and then I'm a

2031
01:39:58,560 --> 01:39:59,560
like the coconut

2032
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:00,560
and Elden Ring.

2033
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:01,560
Let's get to it.

2034
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:03,560
Okay.

2035
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:04,560
Bye bye,

2036
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:05,560
Evelyn.

2037
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:06,560
Thank you for hanging.

2038
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:07,560
Will there be an audio?

2039
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:09,560
Yeah.

2040
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:10,560
That's why

2041
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:11,560
there's a 30 minute

2042
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:12,560
wait

2043
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:13,560
between the pictures.

2044
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:14,560
And then I'll

2045
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:15,560
make an audio.

2046
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:17,560
And whatever

2047
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:18,560
I get,

2048
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,560
I get.

2049
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:20,560
Thank you so much

2050
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:21,560
for hanging.

2051
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:24,560
I will see

2052
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:25,560
you goofy gibberish

2053
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:26,560
tomorrow on

2054
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:27,560
Valentine's.

2055
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:28,560
And then

2056
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:29,560
we can have

2057
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:30,560
lots of fun

2058
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:32,560
on the old

2059
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:33,560
Twitter too.

2060
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:34,560
Okay.

2061
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:35,560
Love you, Evelyn.

2062
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:36,560
I'll see you very shortly.

2063
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:37,560
Bye bye.

2064
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:41,560
Thank you

2065
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:42,560
for letting me

2066
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:43,560
double stream as well.

2067
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:50,560
Bye bye.

2068
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:52,560
See you in a second.

2069
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:56,560
See you in a second.

2070
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:57,560
Bye.
