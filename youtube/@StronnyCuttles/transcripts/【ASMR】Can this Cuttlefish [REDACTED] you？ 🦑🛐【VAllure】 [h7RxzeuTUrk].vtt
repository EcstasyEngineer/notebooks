00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
Hey, I was over for you before we even got started.

00:16.000 --> 00:28.000
Hello, are you there?

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
Can you hear this little call of it?

00:35.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello, my mouth is wiggling because I didn't put my lid on.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
I'm cooking, I'm cooking.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
So professional, so professional.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
My cats are currently play-fighting.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
So if you hear my cats play-fighting, it's going to be terrible.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
I made the mistake of giving my cats what's called a licky lick.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Wait, have I spelled permanent wrong?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
I'm not dead.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
So if you hear bumping about, my cats are going absolutely wild.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Hi.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
Now today is a very short stream.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
But I should really sound like this for you.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Good morning.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Good evening.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
And good afternoon.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
I have lots of fun things to try.

01:56.000 --> 02:05.000
Time to make myself louder or lower the background sound.

02:05.000 --> 02:13.000
Now I just want to say I'm not doing any permanent effects.

02:13.000 --> 02:20.000
So don't worry, you're in good condition.

02:20.000 --> 02:31.000
I will look after you as I hear my cat bumping against my door.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
Hi.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Have I spelled permanent but irrelevant?

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
Now you all know.

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
Make it permanent.

02:50.000 --> 02:59.000
Have to miss this stream, it's okay.

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
We're going nice and slow.

03:06.000 --> 03:17.000
I don't normally use these eyes, but I can't help it.

03:17.000 --> 03:26.000
It was always permanent.

03:26.000 --> 03:33.000
I can never hear my cats run behind my couch.

03:33.000 --> 03:41.000
Oh, there she goes.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Oh, and she's...

03:44.000 --> 03:52.000
Okay, I think she's just jumped on the cardboard box now.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
But take your time to relax.

03:56.000 --> 04:10.000
I think she's beaten up V-core right now.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
Of course, she's been so good.

04:16.000 --> 04:28.000
Literally, she's beaten up V-core right now, but it's okay.

04:28.000 --> 04:40.000
So slowly, you can feel yourself starting to drift.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
And that's okay.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Just like that feeling, come over here.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
No reflex, don't let go.

04:54.000 --> 05:04.000
Oh no, is this ear broken?

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Is this ear broken?

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Oh my gosh, wait, why is one ear stronger than the other?

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
Oh, okay, I just said right into your ear.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Sorry, I just whispered right into your ear.

05:20.000 --> 05:29.000
The ear works, but as less equal, I haven't thought of anything.

05:29.000 --> 05:38.000
I know why, because my focus rate isn't equal.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
It's such a professional stream there.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
No, I should say correct.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
It's okay if it's weaker.

05:48.000 --> 05:55.000
I like them weak.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
What's the best part?

05:58.000 --> 06:06.000
Hello.

06:06.000 --> 06:16.000
I have this gullfish laria to the depths.

06:16.000 --> 06:27.000
For no particular reason at all.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Oh, sorry, I did it twice.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
I have to make it twice.

06:35.000 --> 06:48.000
I'm just gonna brush over your ears to give you the feeling of a false security,

06:48.000 --> 06:56.000
as I'm sure I'm not planning anything else at all.

06:56.000 --> 07:04.000
Not one single thing.

07:04.000 --> 07:13.000
And we get to go down into the depths together.

07:13.000 --> 07:29.000
Just me, and you, and my voice, and you listening in.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
Yeah, gently.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
Brushing over your ears.

07:40.000 --> 07:49.000
And some cats, okay, maybe the catster.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
Wow.

07:55.000 --> 08:04.000
Gentle, gentle movements.

08:04.000 --> 08:14.000
I have some good news for my reflinks.

08:14.000 --> 08:22.000
The YouTube channel has been submitted for monetizing.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
Oh, the heat just came on.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
I need to go turn the heat off, I'm so sorry.

08:31.000 --> 08:43.000
I need to get back to work.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
Oh, see, I did it.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
Are you here?

08:54.000 --> 09:01.000
I'm so professional, let's go.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
Come on, it was me, I won't get all lost being professional, it's me.

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
Okay, when can I start being myself?

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
Or do I need to keep being professional?

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
The cat turned the heat on because it wants attention.

09:24.000 --> 09:34.000
Go, when I'm all of you, let me, okay, give me five more minutes, I'll be serious, okay?

09:34.000 --> 09:50.000
The noise is encapsulating you.

09:50.000 --> 10:04.000
And you feel may have a sense of belonging.

10:04.000 --> 10:17.000
You could even think to yourself, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

10:17.000 --> 10:38.000
If I gave up control, control to one particular girl and it wouldn't be so bad.

10:38.000 --> 10:45.000
What's the worst that could happen from this little gullfish?

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Is there a cat in my room?

10:48.000 --> 10:54.000
Okay, I literally thought Gimli sneaked in there.

10:54.000 --> 11:11.000
As I'm saying control yet, surely this gullfish means no harm.

11:11.000 --> 11:39.000
Even if it was for 24 hours, one day, one day, how much harm could you really be under or could be done in 24 little hours?

11:39.000 --> 11:44.000
No more harm at all.

11:44.000 --> 11:57.000
So slowly your mate wonders, what would this gullfish ask me to do?

11:57.000 --> 12:05.000
Only a few things, my dear refling.

12:05.000 --> 12:14.000
But some things can't be said, only guessed.

12:14.000 --> 12:30.000
You have to go into deeper parts of your mate to know and realize what this gullfish wants.

12:30.000 --> 12:53.000
And maybe my dear refling, you realize I want complete and total control of you.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
Would that be so bad?

12:58.000 --> 13:21.000
No, so maybe that 24 hours becomes 48 and then 48 becomes 72.

13:21.000 --> 13:34.000
And before you know it, this gullfish has had a week of you.

13:34.000 --> 14:02.000
Then two weeks, a month, or maybe just maybe this gullfish mate breaks you.

14:02.000 --> 14:12.000
That's just my things that I want.

14:12.000 --> 14:22.000
But you have to earn the things you want, so I need to bathe, don't I?

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
I need to do the right things.

14:28.000 --> 14:36.000
So you're encapsulated by me, yeah?

14:36.000 --> 14:46.000
So how about just for now, I'll be a good girl for you.

14:46.000 --> 14:57.000
And maybe, just maybe, you'll be a very good boy for me.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
Does that sound like a plan, my dear refling?

15:03.000 --> 15:18.000
Yeah, let's see how much we can bathe together.

15:18.000 --> 15:33.000
Let's be on our best behavior then.

15:33.000 --> 15:40.000
I'll tell you a way that I can be good for you.

15:40.000 --> 15:52.000
I'll allow you, refling, to take sentences you want me to say in chat right now.

15:52.000 --> 16:06.000
And I just might go from ear to ear and gain more favor from you as I say what you want to hear.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
Does that sound like a plan?

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
Because I'd love to do that for you.

16:14.000 --> 16:21.000
Gain your favor, huh?

16:21.000 --> 16:27.000
Say bye, means couple fish in Italian.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
Hi, honey.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
All lay on the reef.

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
You're such a believable little thing, aren't ya?

16:43.000 --> 16:50.000
That's why we have such fun together, isn't it, refling?

16:51.000 --> 16:59.000
I love you, refling.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
I'm proud of you.

17:03.000 --> 17:11.000
I'm proud of us.

17:11.000 --> 17:21.000
And I'm totally not hypnotizing you right now.

17:21.000 --> 17:29.000
Oh, you're not gonna be a loser, are you, refling?

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
You're not gonna lose to me.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
Don't tell me this is enough to put you under my spell.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
You have to make me work for it, refling.

17:41.000 --> 17:53.000
You do less work really, really hard.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
Here we go.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
You can look in my eyes.

18:01.000 --> 18:12.000
Just done the spiral.

18:12.000 --> 18:22.000
Dear.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
Do you like looking into my eyes?

18:26.000 --> 18:36.000
I think they're rather dandelizing, don't ya?

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
I can make my eyes open wide like this.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Staring right at you.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
I see you.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
And you see me.

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
And you see everything I'm doing to you.

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
Right at this very second.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
It's okay.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
You can blink.

19:07.000 --> 19:12.000
But don't look away for too long.

19:12.000 --> 19:19.000
Remember, we have to behave for one another.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
Do you like that?

19:30.000 --> 19:40.000
Just tap on your ears gently, gently, gently.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
You're more welcome.

19:44.000 --> 19:51.000
You're more than welcome to blink.

19:51.000 --> 19:57.000
And sink.

19:57.000 --> 20:09.000
I quite like that phrase, blink and sink.

20:09.000 --> 20:16.000
It's okay if your body starts to feel a bit weaker.

20:16.000 --> 20:23.000
And if your mind starts to wander, that's okay.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
You may even say little refling.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
That's by design.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
Yeah.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
I don't know.

20:38.000 --> 20:44.000
There's just something about you being a bit tired around me.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
Maybe you don't want to fade back.

20:49.000 --> 20:56.000
Not like you could by the time I'm done with ya.

21:03.000 --> 21:12.000
My little refling, why don't you come a little bit closer?

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
I promise I won't pay.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
No.

21:17.000 --> 21:32.000
In fact, you may blink what you faint as you go deeper and deeper with me.

21:42.000 --> 21:51.000
Deeper and deeper your thoughts are turning to confusion.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
What did you say?

21:54.000 --> 22:01.000
With only my voice remaining in your head,

22:01.000 --> 22:13.000
you don't have to focus on a single thing other than what this luring cuttlefish is saying.

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
There, there.

22:18.000 --> 22:25.000
Just look at me and forget.

22:25.000 --> 22:37.000
All you need to know, refling, is that you're safe and you're in good hands with me.

22:37.000 --> 22:51.000
And by the time I'm finished with you, you'll already want to be going under again.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
Your little refling.

22:54.000 --> 23:00.000
I'll give you a tingle break, okay?

23:00.000 --> 23:08.000
I'll say more phrases shortly, but have a little break, break, break, break.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
We need to take things slow.

23:13.000 --> 23:26.000
Think of it as an introduction to your induction.

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
But please don't worry.

23:31.000 --> 23:38.000
There will be no permanent effects in this dream.

23:38.000 --> 23:46.000
So you are welcome to go as deep as you like with me.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
Yeah.

23:49.000 --> 24:01.000
Although I do admit this good girl likes it when you go deep.

24:01.000 --> 24:07.000
Yeah.

24:07.000 --> 24:14.000
Thank you for the death, little refling.

24:14.000 --> 24:23.000
You like when I do ASMR streams on you, huh?

24:23.000 --> 24:35.000
Oh, I had plenty of time to think of how I could truly make you break you.

24:35.000 --> 24:42.000
This is one of many, okay?

24:42.000 --> 24:51.000
So to those who may be resistant, that's okay.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Because I'm coming for you.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
Do you understand?

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
I will get you.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
That is my goal.

25:04.000 --> 25:11.000
And have I failed any of my goals so far?

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
No, little refling.

25:15.000 --> 25:20.000
So heed my warning.

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
I am coming.

25:32.000 --> 25:39.000
Yeah.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
Relax.

25:47.000 --> 25:55.000
If you think my words are waking you up,

25:55.000 --> 26:05.000
they should be slowly bringing you down.

26:05.000 --> 26:12.000
Down, down, down, okay?

26:12.000 --> 26:21.000
That's why we need a little timer where we just listen in.

26:21.000 --> 26:30.000
And whatever our brain and body decides will do.

26:30.000 --> 26:38.000
But that doesn't mean this cuttlefish can suggest a few things to you.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Huh?

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
Yeah.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
Hey.

26:48.000 --> 27:03.000
Just let whatever happens happen.

27:03.000 --> 27:12.000
I won't be beating you purposefully in a trance, okay?

27:12.000 --> 27:20.000
But if you just happen to be so well-trained,

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
I welcome it entirely.

27:24.000 --> 27:34.000
I welcome my voice in encapsulating your mind.

27:34.000 --> 27:41.000
I welcome your full attention.

27:41.000 --> 27:54.000
So be good, little refling, and don't keep me waiting.

27:54.000 --> 28:01.000
Yeah.

28:01.000 --> 28:07.000
You might feel it starting from your head

28:07.000 --> 28:15.000
and slowly a sensation radiates downwards

28:15.000 --> 28:22.000
down to your neck, then your shoulders.

28:22.000 --> 28:27.000
And that sensation splits off.

28:27.000 --> 28:34.000
It splits going down your arms and chest at the same time.

28:34.000 --> 28:46.000
Slowly, slowly, slowly radiating its way through your body.

28:46.000 --> 28:51.000
Turn your stomach.

28:51.000 --> 28:57.000
Down, down, down.

28:57.000 --> 29:02.000
And past your hips.

29:02.000 --> 29:08.000
It's already gone through your fingertips at this point.

29:08.000 --> 29:17.000
And down your legs, your thighs, your calves, your feet.

29:17.000 --> 29:26.000
Until that sensation is all over.

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
There's nothing you can do about it, but that's okay.

29:31.000 --> 29:37.000
Because the sensation is pleasant.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
It's warm.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
It feels comforting.

29:44.000 --> 29:50.000
It's hard for you to describe, but that's okay.

29:50.000 --> 29:57.000
I will do the talking for the both of us.

29:57.000 --> 30:10.000
That sensation is you possibly entering a trance, and that's okay.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
It's nice when I'm in control.

30:14.000 --> 30:24.000
It's nice when you let me in control.

30:28.000 --> 30:33.000
Enjoy the feeling, okay?

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
Enjoy the sensation.

30:37.000 --> 30:42.000
We're both doing it together, aren't we?

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
Yeah.

30:46.000 --> 30:53.000
Yeah, good.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
For you.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
Are your limbs feeling heavy?

31:00.000 --> 31:06.000
It's okay, little reef-like, that's just a side effect.

31:06.000 --> 31:12.000
But over time, you'll may enjoy it.

31:12.000 --> 31:20.000
Because when your limbs feel heavy, that's when you know, that's when you know this kind of fish.

31:20.000 --> 31:26.000
As in control.

31:26.000 --> 31:34.000
And I'll keep you safe when you're with me, okay?

31:34.000 --> 31:40.000
Okay, little reef-like.

31:40.000 --> 31:45.000
For you.

31:45.000 --> 31:52.000
Very you, little reef-like.

31:52.000 --> 31:58.000
This is all by your choice.

31:58.000 --> 32:05.000
Although you might be too deep, should I bring you back up?

32:05.000 --> 32:14.000
Or are you strong enough to give me some braces you want to hear?

32:14.000 --> 32:21.000
Do you think you could do that for me, little reef-like?

32:21.000 --> 32:37.000
You tell me what you want to hear, and this kind of fish will be, will both be good for each other.

32:37.000 --> 32:46.000
Because I'm ready to obey you.

32:46.000 --> 32:51.000
You're doing such a good job.

32:51.000 --> 32:59.000
I'm so proud of how far you've come, little reef-like.

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
Back and forth.

33:04.000 --> 33:12.000
Ear to ear.

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
Yeah.

33:16.000 --> 33:34.000
You did good today, and I can see how hard you're working.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
Well done, little reef-like.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
Well done.

33:41.000 --> 33:48.000
You're a good boy, and I'm a good girl.

33:48.000 --> 33:56.000
Together we'll have lots of fun.

33:56.000 --> 34:01.000
Just surrender and let me take control.

34:01.000 --> 34:07.000
My little reef-like.

34:07.000 --> 34:12.000
I know it's hard right now, but you'll make it through.

34:12.000 --> 34:20.000
You always do, don't you?

34:20.000 --> 34:25.000
And I'm sure you will.

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
You always do, don't you?

34:30.000 --> 34:39.000
And I'll be there on the other side cheering you on.

34:39.000 --> 34:54.000
Oh, my little reef-like, would you kindly be a good little boy for mommy?

34:54.000 --> 35:11.000
Oh, you're so heavy and so deep and so happy to give yourself to me.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
Resistance is futile at this point.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
Just give in, give up.

35:19.000 --> 35:27.000
My strength is unrelenting, my stamina unending.

35:27.000 --> 35:33.000
One way or another, you are main.

35:33.000 --> 35:43.000
Got it?

35:43.000 --> 35:50.000
Okay, let's relax, relax, relax, relax.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
There we go.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
I'll bring you back up a little.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
I don't want you guys to get so deep now.

36:00.000 --> 36:09.000
This was supposed to be a very gentle and secret induction.

36:09.000 --> 36:18.000
I'll do some more little tingles.

36:18.000 --> 36:22.000
Oh, my reef-links.

36:22.000 --> 36:33.000
I don't know if I should bring you back up or if I should leave you in the trance if you're in one.

36:33.000 --> 36:39.000
You want to go a little deeper?

36:39.000 --> 36:44.000
I need to be gentle with you, though.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Don't you see?

36:46.000 --> 36:57.000
I've had so much time to think of how hard I was gonna...

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
What's the word, eh?

37:01.000 --> 37:10.000
How hard I was gonna go on you, and I need to be able to not break you.

37:10.000 --> 37:15.000
I don't want to break you, no more.

37:15.000 --> 37:25.000
I want to make you break you, but that takes time.

37:25.000 --> 37:31.000
We just need to spend a little more time together.

37:31.000 --> 37:37.000
And my stomach is making nice as I root.

37:37.000 --> 37:44.000
If you bring us back up, it makes dropping back down even better.

37:44.000 --> 37:54.000
Please, oh, bring you guys.

37:54.000 --> 38:06.000
Yeah, just relax and let loose all of those burdens.

38:06.000 --> 38:14.000
Because when you're under, I'll be supporting you.

38:14.000 --> 38:24.000
And I'll caress all over you, look after you.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
I can only say the right stuff.

38:28.000 --> 38:34.000
Over reef-links.

38:35.000 --> 38:43.000
Okay, I'm going to slowly bring you back again.

38:43.000 --> 38:50.000
And just take your time, slowly.

38:50.000 --> 38:55.000
You can feel yourself come up.

38:55.000 --> 39:01.000
That heavy feeling that's all over your body

39:01.000 --> 39:06.000
is lifting slowly,

39:06.000 --> 39:11.000
reversing from the path it once took,

39:11.000 --> 39:18.000
from your feet to your calves and thighs.

39:18.000 --> 39:24.000
Your thoughts are becoming their own again.

39:24.000 --> 39:33.000
That sensation coming back up, up, up your body.

39:33.000 --> 39:42.000
Past your hips, your stomach, your chest,

39:42.000 --> 39:47.000
your fingertips, your hands to your elbows,

39:47.000 --> 39:54.000
your shoulders slowly up, up, up.

39:54.000 --> 40:01.000
Until that sensation goes back to your collar,

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
your neck, your head.

40:06.000 --> 40:12.000
Until you're you again, little reef-links.

40:13.000 --> 40:19.000
Welcome back to the land of the living.

40:19.000 --> 40:26.000
Hi, reef-links. Did you have fun?

40:26.000 --> 40:33.000
Yeah, good morning. Good morning, little reef-links.

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
What's my tracking every such a sweet day? Hold on.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
You need to calibrate.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
Wow! Calibration complete.

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
Strawny returns, the mean lord herself.

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
My cup of tea got cold. I go really into that.

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
I'm sorry, I really go into that.

40:55.000 --> 41:01.000
But my cup of tea is cold, so I can have my cup of tea.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
Good morning, little reef-links, or afternoon, or evening,

41:05.000 --> 41:10.000
or good time zone.

41:10.000 --> 41:15.000
Oh, let me, uh, this is more me, I think.

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
Yeah, yeah, this is more me.

41:19.000 --> 41:24.000
Microwave the tea, reef-links, don't be so silly.

41:24.000 --> 41:28.000
Special thank you again to Anonymous for the tip.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.000
Anonymous said, holy moly, this case of our stream is so good.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
Thank you very much. Yeah, that was me trying hard in.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
But now you've got the mean lord me.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
Yeah, get rigged.

41:40.000 --> 41:45.000
It's very unlikely I will pull out off again in this stream,

41:45.000 --> 41:52.000
because I am fricking rubbish at being fricking, uh, what's the word, serious.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
Yeah, I should probably, uh, maybe we just calm it down.

41:56.000 --> 42:00.000
Hi, it's me. I'll leave the background as quite soothing, but it's me again.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
Hi, I'll be playing.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
That Kremlin's back, that's right, get dunked on.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Yeah.

42:11.000 --> 42:15.000
Are you enjoying AC's Anonymous?

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
I can't say Brian.

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
Oh, thank you for the tip, Anonymous.

42:20.000 --> 42:24.000
Anonymous says, trying to cute. Yeah, we cute up in her.

42:25.000 --> 42:32.000
Kremlin's back, little baby, so don't be expecting any serious to come out of my mouth for the rest of this stream.

42:32.000 --> 42:40.000
Right, if you're here, if you're here for that section we just did, sorry, the meme-er, the meme-er is back, okay?

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
My voice is right from Brunscape yesterday.

42:44.000 --> 42:52.000
But I do plan on doing weekly ASMR streams, which is why I do say please and like and subscribe for more.

42:52.000 --> 43:02.000
Uh, the fantastic news, my little wieflings, the fantastic news is my channel is being submitted for monetization,

43:02.000 --> 43:10.000
which means I can finally start uploading my ASMR videos for my 1000, so thank you.

43:10.000 --> 43:16.000
I'm already at 4000 subscribers, which is amazing, which means I owe you, yes you, listening in.

43:16.000 --> 43:21.000
That's right, this streamer owes you content.

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
So I have four ASMR videos getting ready.

43:26.000 --> 43:34.000
So we've submitted my channel to YouTube, and I'm sure they're gonna really like that, James Cameron's Avatar stream, yeah.

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
When I absolutely raged.

43:38.000 --> 43:44.000
But yeah, the meme-er is back, don't be expecting anything, but how good is this ASMR sound?

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
So how good is this?

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
Oh, I should maybe take off the hybnal background.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
Now you get to your most stomach even more.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Thank you for the tip.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
Oh, Irfan Biscotti, thank you for the tips.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
Thank you, Momay, very nice and relaxing.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
I'm glad you like felt that.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
Though returning to Kremlin mode is good too, yeah.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
That's more like me.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Best of luck on monetization.

44:10.000 --> 44:15.000
Thank you for the tip, and yes, um, for that kind of thing,

44:15.000 --> 44:21.000
I'm most likely gonna be doing free content on Twitter.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
Milk Katmas, thank you for the tip.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
That was amazing.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
Please, for the love of all, that is strong.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
Keep an eye out for all of this posted.

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
I never did anything wrong in this stream.

44:36.000 --> 44:42.000
I have done everything correct, but this, this is a sensory toy,

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
and this is my favorite ASMR trigger right now.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
Listen to it.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Ain't that amazing?

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
Thank you so much for that tip, Milk Katmas.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
But yeah, I didn't do anything wrong this stream.

45:00.000 --> 45:08.000
But if you didn't know, AC Snowballs is live right now doing a DJ session.

45:08.000 --> 45:15.000
So if you're needing this to be a bit more, if you're needing a bit more hype for your stream,

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
definitely check her out.

45:18.000 --> 45:23.000
M-A, Shabby, and Azura, I believe we're all going live as well.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
This is the shortest stream for me.

45:26.000 --> 45:30.000
We will be redirecting into Shabby Cotton Bomb.

45:30.000 --> 45:34.000
Sounds like a piece of rubber stuck to the surface.

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
Heck yeah, I was a good girl this stream.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
I did everything correct.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Yeah, it sounds like one of those squeeze stress toys.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Yeah.

45:53.000 --> 45:58.000
I just don't want to risk it, and also you only want to say the name, right?

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
I don't even know what I'm saying.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
I forgot.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Wait, you're going already?

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
No, I'm going to do Gremlin ASMR.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.000
I'm going to do ASMR like me.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Look, I even have this to put on your ears.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Are you ready?

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Look, look, look, look.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
I'm going to put this on your ears.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Ready?

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Look.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
You're almost home.

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
You can Gremlin ASMR.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Yeah.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
This has a name.

46:46.000 --> 46:50.000
I'm rubbing them all against your ears.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
I put winter earmuffs on your ears.

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
Wow, then I did stream with absolutely no ears.

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
What do you mean by cats fighting at the start of the stream?

47:10.000 --> 47:14.000
They're not going to leave a like, and then don't leave my sound.

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
Yeah, you're so fluffy.

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
Fluffy, fluffy, fluffy.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
You're so fluffy.

47:24.000 --> 47:30.000
First, I'm listening to ASMR.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
I'm going to come back for more.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Glad I could take it.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
You're in your ears.

47:36.000 --> 47:42.000
It's nice to have a short stream to recover from your infinite stamina.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
My voice is really broken,

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
but because I'm whispering, you can't tell it's broken.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Hippie.

47:48.000 --> 47:52.000
Oh, some people like chucking ASMR.

47:52.000 --> 47:56.000
I have lots of chucking water.

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
Have I been a good girl for you?

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Wait, wait, wait.

48:22.000 --> 48:36.000
Yeah, I forgot my tea.

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
I've got a cold cup of tea over here.

48:40.000 --> 48:44.000
But I was having a lot of fun doing that ASMR.

48:44.000 --> 48:54.000
And really, sorry, my throat's making rock noises.

48:54.000 --> 48:58.000
Yeah, but this is just going to be an easier stream,

48:58.000 --> 49:06.000
because I don't want to break my voice.

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
This is the closest I've ever been to me.

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
I'm usually so focused on trying to go under.

49:14.000 --> 49:20.000
See, but I think because I didn't plan any of what I was saying,

49:20.000 --> 49:24.000
because I was like natural, it made it easier to enjoy.

49:24.000 --> 49:30.000
That's probably why.

49:30.000 --> 49:34.000
Be a good girl and swallow what you...

49:34.000 --> 49:38.000
Reflings, we're trying to leave this up.

49:38.000 --> 49:42.000
Will you ever do a full hypno video?

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Yeah, definitely.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
I need to make sure I make it safe though.

49:46.000 --> 49:50.000
I need to educate myself a bit more,

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
because I need it all to be safe.

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
Which is why I'm not doing any permanent effects on this stream,

49:56.000 --> 50:02.000
because I may or may not have an interest in permanent effects,

50:02.000 --> 50:08.000
but I already have an audio recorded that undoes any effects that I may do on you.

50:08.000 --> 50:12.000
But I really like the permanent effects stuff.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
I'm sorry, it's just what I'm interested in,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
and I may want to break you a little bit, but just a little bit.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
It's not going to be bad or anything.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Like it's just going to be a wee bit of breaking, okay?

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Just a wee bit.

50:22.000 --> 50:26.000
Not a big bit.

50:26.000 --> 50:30.000
So yeah, I need to make sure I do it 100% safe.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Oh, bro.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Break me, mom.

50:34.000 --> 50:38.000
To keep up the buns, I just have to say,

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
you and your eyes were astonishing.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Thank you.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
I love it.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
70% break.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Take or leave it.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
And before we commit more crimes.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Effects like what?

50:54.000 --> 50:58.000
Oh, so there's like different kinds of like hypno,

50:58.000 --> 51:06.000
and so you can purposely make like trainer ones where like I train you,

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
like I literally path off your subconscious to react to me,

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
or to do something,

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
or react in a certain way,

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
and I need to make sure it's super safe,

51:20.000 --> 51:27.000
and I need, if I do an audio that basically states that like I don't have an effect on you anymore,

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
it tells your subconscious through everything that you learned out of the window,

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
and then it's all safe.

51:36.000 --> 51:41.000
Welcome to Stunny Cat's YouTube, where safety number one priority.

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
Thoughts already doomed.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Stunning her permanent effect.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
It would be like you will only donate your ink to me.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
Basically, kind of.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
It's the plan.

51:54.000 --> 52:00.000
I want to do like sessions that last two hours long.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
I can't wait.

52:02.000 --> 52:08.000
I know my voice is going to be fried, but yeah.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
Will there be lullabies for the replay?

52:11.000 --> 52:18.000
My voice is broken, but I know you are my sunshine.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
You are my sunshine.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
My only sunshine.

52:24.000 --> 52:29.000
You make me happy when skies are gray.

52:29.000 --> 52:34.000
You'll never know, dear, much I love you.

52:34.000 --> 52:39.000
So please don't take my replay away.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
Lullabies!

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
I don't know many other lullabies.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Um...

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
Freerejaka. Freerejaka.

52:51.000 --> 52:55.000
Dormefu. Dormefu.

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
Would be cool if you had a button that made the camera zoom in on your eyes.

52:59.000 --> 53:05.000
Oh, well, next stream, I'll have a tracker, so it follows my head around.

53:05.000 --> 53:10.000
So you can't escape my eyes, but I wanted to go very easy.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
Very easy on the first one.

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
Please don't take my sunshine away.

53:16.000 --> 53:20.000
Dormefu. Dormefu.

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
There's that cradle one.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
The cradle you will fall.

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
Rock, bye, baby, on the tree top.

53:29.000 --> 53:33.000
When the wind blows, the cradle will rock.

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
I don't know the rest.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
What were your inspirations for being?

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
I have no themed career.

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
I've always, always loved it.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
I've always loved it.

53:45.000 --> 53:50.000
But I have always known how deep the rabbit hole goes.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
And I've touched on surface level.

53:53.000 --> 53:57.000
But I was like, I want to go, I want to go rabbit hole.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
Sorry, the wire is spilling on the desk.

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
I want to go all in, baby, all in.

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
So, will the table at the top be fixed?

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
No, if you tell me, I have to spell the word.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
What's the word?

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Be'er me.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
Was it, was it?

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
Be'er me.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
Be'er me.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
I need.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
Be'er me.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
I need.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
Okay, there you go.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
Just like that, see, I can do it.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Okay, you even had to bring gremlin.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Gremlin.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
No.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Gremlin.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Wow, look at that.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Super professional.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Sorry.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
We're going down the heaven of the world.

54:41.000 --> 54:45.000
Yeah, there's like so much to it that I just knew I couldn't do it.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
Until, until it would stay.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
And now it's time.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
I'm going to be deppy.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
I'm gremlin-ized.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
Yeah.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
Don't be expecting anything serious from me.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
How did you like my head load?

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Obnoxiously load my keyboard?

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
Oh yeah.

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
It's so good.

55:10.000 --> 55:18.000
So I, for triggers, I like double finger-clicking.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
I like finger-clicking.

55:20.000 --> 55:25.000
For words or phrases, I want to do what you kindly.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
I want to do mehabs.

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
Because I say mehabs all the time.

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
Mehabs, refling, you want to go deeper.

55:36.000 --> 55:42.000
Which you kindly, refling, go deeper with me.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
Like, oh, those are such good trigger words.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
But yeah.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
Is Johnny susceptible to hypnosis?

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
Yes.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
My biggest enemy are mirrors.

55:55.000 --> 55:59.000
Unfortunately, I can fall to my own hypnosis.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
But it only lasts 24 hours.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
It's fain, it's fain.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Would you kindly, would be hilarious?

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
Yes, we're literally doing it off of BioShock.

56:11.000 --> 56:16.000
Look, look, um, we're gamers out here, okay?

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
We're gamers.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
We're here for the memes as well.

56:20.000 --> 56:28.000
But it doesn't mean we can't incorporate our favourite games into our other activities.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
Johnny drilling on the floor in front of a mirror.

56:32.000 --> 56:37.000
Stop, I want to order so much artwork about all these different plots.

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
And like, oh no, the reflings have found me.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
Just going to beat you into a mirror.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
We didn't, oh no.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
But we are doing hypnosis in general.

56:52.000 --> 57:00.000
But I've already done the segment because I need to be gremlin gamer mode right now.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
Because it's me, I can't help it.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
I'm just a freaking meme lord.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
It's hard to be serious, okay?

57:09.000 --> 57:16.000
Yeah, enjoy the memes while enjoying our, you didn't finish that sentence.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Why are you not finishing it?

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
We're not here gaming.

57:20.000 --> 57:25.000
We're only big gamers here, yeah, tons of games.

57:25.000 --> 57:39.000
Remember that a man, a man bleeds a slave obeys and reflings feel prey for the orders coming from the queue.

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
Yeah, put on a suit for your serious stream.

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
Oh, a man chooses, oops, sorry.

57:46.000 --> 57:51.000
A man chooses a refling obeys.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Oh wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Wait, pause, pause, pause the tunes.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Okay, hold on, pause the tunes, pause the tunes.

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
Oh hi, I see in berries, hold on, we're caught in bio shock.

58:07.000 --> 58:14.000
A man chooses a refling obeys.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Oh wait, why is my freaking calibration?

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
I was looking at the pollin.

58:22.000 --> 58:26.000
Hi, A.C. in snowberries, I promise I'm not trying to hypnotize you.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
We're in Kremlin hours, okay?

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Hi, A.C. girl, I was your rave.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
I hope your voice is okay.

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
I was watching you in the bath again.

58:36.000 --> 58:41.000
I take a bath every morning to try and steam my throat before stream.

58:41.000 --> 58:48.000
A.C. is live, so I was watching her and she dressed up as a princess the way Mercy Drew are.

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
If you guys didn't see Mercy Drew, I'll turn it off.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
It was amazing.

58:55.000 --> 59:03.000
Maybe at the end of stream, I will do, I will do maybe serious mode, okay?

59:03.000 --> 59:08.000
I'm actually gonna make sure I'm reading into Shibi.

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
Sorry, I'm reflecting to the screen right now.

59:13.000 --> 59:18.000
But yeah, let's just hold on.

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
Customization, redirect.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
We partied now.

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
All the snowberries are tired.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Little babies.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Shibi's playing call of the lamb.

59:30.000 --> 59:34.000
Oh my god, I think me and Shibi might be doing multiplayer call of the lamb.

59:35.000 --> 59:39.000
Is Shibi first and then Azura and then Mercy?

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
Who's coming online first, Azura or Mercy?

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Eh, Azura or Shibi?

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
She had a big mercy.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Uchi-san party?

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
Ah, it's tall, that's terrible.

59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Did the Uchi-sans have a good time or are you all ready for a nap after that?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Hold on, I'll just check.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Who comes online first?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Is Azura or is it Azura or Azura?

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Wait, where is Azura?

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I just don't know.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I'm sure the girl's on my screen.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:21.000
But yeah, I first Azura live and have a long Azura's live.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Oh, oh wait, in 5, 10?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Okay, no, it's definitely Shibi that comes up next.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Sorry.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
It was amazing.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Oh, Uchi-sans, time to pay you to sleep.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Come here, old man.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
You're too faint.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000
You barged so hard with Azura

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
and she showed you how much energy she has, yeah?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Oh, and you've used up all your energy, Uchi-san.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Time to pay you to sleep by a Kremlin.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I'm ready to chill for a moment.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Yeah.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I made a little induction at the end of the stream,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
but right now we're a Kremlin mode, okay?

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I can't be serious.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I laughed, I cried, I...

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
What?

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Am I supposed to even pronounce that?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Even in our ASMR streams, you speak fast.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Oh yeah, you think that's speaking fast?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Can you be serious?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Not for long.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Kremlin mode activated, yeah.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
We're real ASMRists out here.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
I'm speaking in an enchanted main craft table.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.000
It's pronounced U-O-U-O.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Surely you can be serious.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
But what was that?

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
It's called Ace Globes.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Because Ace finished her stream, I'm using the Ace Globes.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000
I fell farther in love with my cute and funny Uchi-san loving.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Oshii.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000
And this is why we don't have chat on screen during ASMR streams.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
What is that?

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
It's the unknown.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000
A.C. should introduce you to Igor.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Who's Igor?

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Ace Globes are so nice, yeah.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Mercy had some Ace Globes in her ASMR.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
And Emi Gopska must on Ace Globes.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.000
I don't know if she said the story yet, so I'll let her tell the story.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I feel better already.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
You and Igor will get along well.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I feel better already, yeah.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
There's no permanent influence on this stream, what does that mean?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:30.000
So some hypnosis ASMRists like to mark you and leave you with a present.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
And I'm not doing that because we are slowly...

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
...working our way.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:44.000
You have to take things slow and take your time.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.000
And I'm gonna take my time with you briefly.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
And get you all tired.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Oh, it's a reference to the polar bear game.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Would you ever use water next to a $2,000 microphone?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I don't know, this is the best water you're gonna get.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Permanent hypnosis is just a gift that keeps on giving.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Slow indoctrination.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Would you kindly rethink?

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Let me do what I want to you.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.000
It's time to come down from the party, Snowberry.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
You're under the sea.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
No need hypnosis for that.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Always.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Today was already a chill day for me, so this stream was really fun.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
I'm glad.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I'll try to do ASMR streams every week.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Yeah, my back hurts.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Okay, true OG suns for it.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
But yes, I will do ASMR every week.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Some more intense than the other.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Some plots as well.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Like, feel probably plots making life.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000
And I do, like, when I get you guys to talk and give me suggestions,

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I do apologize if you typed for me to say something.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I had to make sure it fitted with the theme,

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
which is why I brought you up so I can start being a gremlin again,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
because I didn't want you to be down and be gremlin mode.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Big Willy Wallace is morally wet.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
My back's gone after that DJ stream.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
That's so good.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
I break from my own mind every week.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Yeah.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Oh yeah, some good plots.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Oh yeah.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Some real deep thought-provoking plots.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Okay, let me see if this is freaking tracking.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I think, because I'm not sure.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Okay.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Okay, I think this better.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
My mouse tracking just kind of stops working after all.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
It's like, I think it gets confused with the ASMR mic.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
You like the background things.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
I made it myself.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
I did it.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
I'm not like it in Adobe After Effects.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Bass streamer and vealer.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
All my girls were bass streamer and vealer.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
They're all the best.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Yeah.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
No.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
You do you.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Strongly, we still love you.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Yeah.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
That background is amazing.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Yes.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I can also go faster or slower,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
but I'll do that another time.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
But just so that I can really make it intense, okay?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Like, I, this, this sound you hear,

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:22.000
this, I can also make it faster and more intense.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
So please don't think I haven't thought this through.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Wait, wait, wait.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
It's over for you.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Don't resist.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
There's no point in resisting.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Okay, love, rethink.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000
You are main.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Just give me some time.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Just let me kick.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Me kick.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Terrible.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
And then what?

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Oh no, all my money's going into your pocket.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
That's terrible, replay.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Yeah.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
That sin doesn't have any side effects.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
No, no, none of them have secret.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
I have no secret agenda.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Thank you, window for cracking during the ASMR stream.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
That window cracked like three times during my segments.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I was like, really, you're getting rude.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
I wasn't sure if I liked the background noise,

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
but I really like it all.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
If you don't like that noise, don't worry,

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I'll train you to like it.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Just stop resisting.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Your efforts are futile.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
You will not win against me.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I have unending stamina.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Are my streams not proof enough?

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Thank you for the tip.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Irwin Blair, thank you for the tip.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Yes, must give all money to feel it.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Thank you for the tip, Irwin.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Support my babies.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Support my babies so they can move out.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
And I can buy them a better internet connection.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Thank you so much for the tip, though.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I appreciate it greatly.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I need some hydration.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
You can hear some ASMR gulps.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
All gone.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
None left.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Thank you.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Wow.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Strani, does the Cuttlefish's rule perfect?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Only at one speed.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Yes, only one speed.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I didn't want people to think I'm doing a rave.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
I'll fight Mummy's unending stamina

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000
with my own.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Let's see how it comes out on top.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Me.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Oh, the cuttlefish is going to get...

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
This cuttlefish is going to get...

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Hey yo, I can't read that out.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Oh gosh, oh my money's going to skew, gosh.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
For those of you who did drain in a little late,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
my YouTube...

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
I'm going to burp, sorry.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
My YouTube channel's been subbed for monetization.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I'm actually getting a manicure and a pedicure today

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
in preparation for my monetization stream.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
So there's your hint.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Hopefully it comes through quickly.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
And I'm very excited.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Zero I didn't know how to...

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Yeah, I did it into my...

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
I'm wearing a hoodie.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
I'm wearing a hoodie.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
But yeah, I'm getting my first ever manicure and pedicure.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
I have no idea what...

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
I think they like, massage your legs as well.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000
So I'm going to like, get nice and smooth

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
and like, shave my legs.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Just to make sure they don't have to touch my like,

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
stubbly legs.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
But yeah, I will be interesting.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Maybe I should like, live tweet my experience

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
and being like, oh the person's doing this now,

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
they're doing this to my foot.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Because I've never had like, a pedicure

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
is when it's your feet.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Because pediatry is feet care.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
And then manicure, man,

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
manage the balls or your hands.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
And while the rest of the feet allergen

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
begin monetization too,

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
yes, they are being submitted today.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000
I believe we are waiting for the YouTube stats to update.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Because they're taking their sweet time.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
It took a week for the statistics to update.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
And then everyone is doing their monetization,

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
celebration, streams.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
And ooh,

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
everyone's eating good.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
That's all I'm going to say.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
It may as well be,

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000
oh no, it may as well be Thanksgiving.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
What the fuck?

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
My tech.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
What?

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
What the fuck?

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
My phone?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
My phone?

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
My tech talk?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I was so scared.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Oh my god.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I was so scared.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
My phone just,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
my tech talk just opened up on its own.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Bruh,

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
China's listening in.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
What the fuck?

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
I,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
what the fuck?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000
My phone just opened up on its own

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000
to play a freaking advertisement to me.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
What was that?

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I thought someone was outside in the garden.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
I was like, oh my god, there's someone outside my house.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
I need to end stream right now.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
That was scary.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Oh my god.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I was so scared there.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
I was like, what?

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
China, I'll prove to you, sir.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
My Chinese grade, it just went up by 100k.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
That was horrifying.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
I thought that was,

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I was freaking out.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I was like, what?

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000
What?

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
I should be the only thing making noise.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
What was that?

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
What?

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
My heart rate is exhilarated.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Literally my social credit just went up.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
What on earth?

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I think that was an ad,

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
because I opened tech talk.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
And then,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
like it loaded a video or something.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
We can hire her, she said again.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I'm not doing hypnosis.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I'm gremlin mode.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Read the top.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
That's what you get for having TikTok.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
That's what I get for brain run.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
That was scary.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Jeez.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Okay, what was I saying before that?

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Oh, monetization.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Wait, is monetization a trigger word

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
for the TikTok spice?

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
They want the money too.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
What is it?

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Do you want heart beat ASMR?

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I don't think I have

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
a ceiling on it.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
A member ceiling.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
The numbers may send, honestly.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Because I was talking about monetization

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
and then the hand.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
TikTok loves monetization.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
I said, yeah, give me some of that.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Jeez.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Okay.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Let's, let's drag you back into ASMR.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
That freaked me out.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
That was scary, because I was like,

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
hello, hello, who's there?

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Refuel yourself.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Refueling is like you.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Okay.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Just save money.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
I accidentally woke up.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
What happened?

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
My freaking phone started playing ads.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Even though I didn't touch my phone at all.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
I don't think I'm, I'm not bringing.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
I don't like that.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
That was scary.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
We're in your walls.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Oh my gosh.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Okay, let's see if we can do heart beat ASMR.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I need to put, I need to put you over my hoodie.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Okay.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000
But maybe a little loud.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
But this is my heart.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
I'll do, I'll do this side, because it's easier.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000
You have one.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Thank you.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Okay.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Can you hear it?

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Can you hear my heart at all?

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Yeah.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
That's my heart beat.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Is it fast or slow?

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
It might be fast, because I'm talking.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
That's why at the doctor's office,

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:58.000
they tell you not to talk when you take the pressure cuff on your arm.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Do you want to see how fast my heart can go?

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
We're going to mess around, okay?

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
I'm going to turn the volume down.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Okay.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:21.000
And that's just my heart.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
I'm hearing mummies.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
You hear my stomach sound?

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Stop.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
That's how fast my heart can really go.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Can I ruin a surprise for you guys?

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Because it's my content, I'm allowed to ruin the surprise, okay?

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
The stomach was louder than the heart now.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:05.000
I'm going to do an ASMR video, like a role play,

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.000
where you are pregnant and you're in my tummy

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
and I'm talking to you about how proud I am

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.000
and how excited I am for everything you're going to achieve in your life.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000
And I can't wait for you to experience the world,

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000
and it's going to have my actual heartbeat and stomach sounds in it.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.000
And I'm going to tell you all that you deserve,

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
all the good things in life that happen.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And I'm going to be your cheerleader.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000
And yeah, I need to get the artwork commissioned though,

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
because I need to draw me pregnant with you in my tummy.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.000
And I'll be wearing like a mummy outfit and everything.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:01.000
So yeah, and I'm going to tell you how excited I am for you to get to know you

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.000
and I get to see what your personality is like

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
and you're going to be perfect in every way,

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000
because there's no way that my little reef link can do any wrong.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000
That's strangely, yeah, and you're going to hear my tummy sounds on my heartbeat

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000
and my voice is going to be muffled, it's going to be like this, okay?

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000
This is what my voice is going to sound like, wow.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
And I'm so proud of you.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Now my voice is so broken.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I'm sorry I broke my voice, so this doesn't sound very pleasant.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
But I'm so proud of you.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
And I can't wait to meet you.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000
And I can't wait to watch you grow up

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
and do all the things you love

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000
and see what hope is you fall in love with.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000
And you're going to be so smart like your mummy.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Your broken voice sounds like sadness.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Oh no, no, I'm not sad.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
I'm sad that I didn't have my cup of tea,

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.000
but I had a lot of fun getting you very deep into the moment.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Who's the daddy?

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000
You, again, rifling.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Don't you not know the failure or the lore?

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.000
The reason why I have five daughters is all because of the riflings.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000
See, in order to make sure that no one rifling can claim that they're the daddy,

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:52.000
all of us got together, turned the lights out and just went for it,

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
okay, we just went for it.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000
That's why we have five daughters.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
We should do that again sometime.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Yeah, you want to find out what book it is?

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
We're both hired out.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.000
We've actually been confirmed that we are showing up to a convention,

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
but it's in 2025.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
But I think it's in California.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
I'm all the riflings on the daddy.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000
But yeah, very excited.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I don't know, it would be nice if we could all meet up at a convention,

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
but I don't know how the girls feel about her,

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.000
and I have absolutely horrific travelling say,

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000
so I'm going to be so high.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
I'm going to be high on medication.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I'm paying for that backstage, Max.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Honestly, I'm the father.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Oh, I'm the father, does a backflip.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Getting the VIP treatment.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Oh yeah.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
I wish I could go to the con.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
I don't know if I can go to the con.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
So please do not book any conventions,

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
like for this whole purpose, in case I show up.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
That's not how it works.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Mummies do weaknesses, travel and marriage.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
I mean, I'll tell it in another stream,

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:51.000
but yeah, it's a very unfun story,

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
surrounding the toilet.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000
My backyard would love to go next.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000
That would be really cute, yeah.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:11.000
I understood booking all conventions on the slim chance that you show up.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Oh my gosh, but then,

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000
stick an entire brief worth of people in a tumble dryer,

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
and you basically get all the feel.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000
If we basically ummed you with five dollars,

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.000
shall we do it again with another five?

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000
No.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
With another six.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Come on, mommy needs to cook.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Like 41 hours away from California.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I think it's in California, I don't know,

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
I actually know where it is.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Six, yeah.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Every gen and veiler,

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
in theory, has six girls,

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:07.000
and there should be one design of each that you gravitate towards.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.000
That's right, I may not be the smartest,

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
but I know what to do someday,

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000
but I like being dumb.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
I like reeflings doing all the thinking for me.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000
What if you gravitate towards all the designs?

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
I don't know, I feel like one has to speak to you.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
So you are the oven.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
I'm just an oven.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
I just need you to fill it.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Let's be dumb together.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
You're great except for the naming part, exactly.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000
What do you mean straw knee 365?

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000
I wonder if I called myself straw knee 365

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000
because my secret goal was to stream every single day for a year.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000
But, yeah, we're already going to blow that out of the water

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
unless I'm gravely ill.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Smooth out the brain wrinkles.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
This is something I could get by it.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000
What if I'm gravitated towards the accent instead?

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Then how's that going, mate?

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
I like this accent.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
That's what tickles your pickle.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Oh, then he might need me.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000
I'll tickle that pickle any day I will.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
What do you mean?

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
You will always be my Archie.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Oh, thank you.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
See, I'm here because fish,

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
who doesn't like fish, also embrace of Xbox,

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
game collection.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000
What's that?

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Yeah, he's been Xbox kid.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Oh, so cool.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000
I used to be one of those kids in the YouTube comments

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000
that were like,

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Xbox is so much cooler than PlayStation.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Yeah, and PlayStation sucks, yeah.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
That accent is good.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000
It's above.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
That accent's funny.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
It can be sexy when I put it on.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:24.000
I feel like if I want to do a voice that commands you,

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
I need to go deeper.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
I'm a console warfare, aren't ya?

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
See, I was bursted,

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000
and had to be asked from a car boot sale for a 5-hour.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
PlayStation died.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Yeah, PlayStation drills.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Strangely, I was on the right team for a day one.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Not beaten, they'd come get me or she get location.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
The Scottish accent is sexy.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
I didn't know how.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Like my actual accent when I'm monthly.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
I'm like, oh, who's it going lads?

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
I'm, yep, this is so as I'm laced.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000
We better have some backpipes at the convention.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
No, that's awful.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000
I double in 360, but I was a Nintendo kid.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Nintendo was so expensive.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
My dad got me a Nintendo TS,

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:32.000
but he was always happier to let me buy like secondhand

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Xbox 360 games over Nintendo's secondhand

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
because it was so expensive.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
We used to have this game shop in the UK

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000
called GameStop or Game.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000
I think they both went past, I can't remember.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
And basically,

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
wait, what?

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.000
They went past, but they used to sell secondhand games

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
and that's how I got all my games.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
They used to do what was called trade-ins

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
and I would have to trade-in my games to get new ones.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
I think Game Stations passed now.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Yeah, wasn't it called EB games?

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Now in the UK, not that I know of,

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000
you aren't wrong though about Nintendo being far too expensive.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Yes.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And they just shut down the eNintendo store.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000
I think GameStop is still a thing.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Did you ever go to CEX?

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
I don't think so.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
I think most game stores did a version of a trade-in model.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Yeah, that's how I got my games.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
It's been Game Stations.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Oh, maybe it's Game Stations that at GameStop.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
It might be Game Stations.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Just remember I was a weebap.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
I just looked at the covers of the games and went,

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Dad, I want that one.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
EB is...

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Wait, what? EB games was in the UK.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Oh, yeah, no.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
If it went bust in 2002,

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000
I never experienced EB games.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
I was Xbox for a long time then Switch

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000
because the Japanese make some fire games.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Game is still a thing in the UK.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.000
GameStop is still a thing in the US.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000
I'll go EB games.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000
We're just EB sleepy gamers.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
I miss choosing games by the cover now I Google them.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Things endlessly.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000
If you're ever one in a new game to completely time sync

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000
and you play PC for mods,

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.000
I recommend the painting of Isaac

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
and I'm not recommending it

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.000
just so you guys can all princess carry me through the game.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
It's a very big game.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Big and gay, big and gay.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Yeah, in the UK, this game is now a game station.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Go buy a buy-up.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Oh, go, go, go.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
EB games was absorbed by GameStop.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Oh my god, we're getting the lore.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000
We're getting the capitalism lore.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Ooh, yeah, painting of Isaac.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Yeah.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
The painting of Isaac doesn't work anymore

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
in your PC, huh?

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Yeah, I had an Xbox, just an Xbox.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Oh, the Xbox original.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
I wanted to get my 360,

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
but I think it's messed up.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:56.000
It's the latest console I own by a country male.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Here's a war hands down based story.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
I'm sure I've just misread that,

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000
but you actually made cameo.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Yeah, it's like a fantasy game.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000
It's really nice.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000
If you're talking about Xbox exclusives,

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
if you're talking about overall,

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
yeah, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000
yeah, sorry, you've just miss,

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
you've just misspelled Assassin's Creed.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:27.000
It's fine, you spell it as, as in, creed.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Yeah, no, it's fine, you've just misspelled.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Don't worry about it.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
I can read through what you're missing.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Any fellow guitar hero enjoyers,

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
tilly, tilly, tilly.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
I wish Army of Two was multiplayer,

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.000
but no, I don't think.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000
I would love to do Army of Two.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Oh, did you ever have a Game Boy?

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.000
I did, and I had like three Game Boy games.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:06.000
My dad, so if my dad bought the console,

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.000
he would let me play it, basically,

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
and he bought a Game Boy,

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.000
and he didn't like it, so he gave it to me.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.000
And I played Pokemon Ribby.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:26.000
I played Legend of Zelda Minish Cap,

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:32.000
and one more game that I,

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000
I'm sure there's one more game I probably played.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
I forgot.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.000
The Minish Cap is my only Zelda game.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Oh, my voice is breaking.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Legend of Zelda.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Mama Minish Cap.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Oh, sorry.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Oh, no, wait, no, sorry, tapping ASMR.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Little, little tappies.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Doesn't actually sound that nice.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
I don't know what 33 Immortals is.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I haven't heard about it, have we?

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
What's your favorite Pokemon?

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
And why is it Shantler?

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
I actually didn't mean Lightwick.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Lightwick is so cute,

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
but see, Pokemon have this thing

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000
where they make a really cute, adorable, creepy Pokemon,

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000
and then its evolution is Oakland.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000
I didn't want ugly, ugly evolutions.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Lightwick is adorable.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
It's an MMO.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000
We're knee-deep in RuneScape right now.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I took the console with me everywhere.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
It'd be the crap out of the paints worn out,

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
but it still works.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000
All old-school games, I don't see.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Literally think of, what is it?

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Joystick Drift?

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
No, that's not a gender name.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
It's a Joy-Con Drift.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Oh, that's a Joy-Con Drift on Nintendo Switch.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000
But, like, Game Boy advances that were made

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
how many years back still work.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.000
I'm catching up on old-school RuneScape vision now.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Did you all know there was a Pokemon card game on Game Boy?

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Nope.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
It's in the up-gaming.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Sorry, my voice is cracking.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Hello, I've got 25 minutes,

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
and then I'm required for an official vocal rest,

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
and we are reading into Shibi playing.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.000
If you didn't know, Cult of the Lamb is a 10 out of 10 game.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
I rate it very highly.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
I had a Game Boy card game.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
It was so fun.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Courtney was all, uh, it was Courtney.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000
The Game Boy card game was actually really good.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Sorry, can't go back to sleep.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
May as well cook something.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Oh, very good.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
And Jack and Kenabiana.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Huh?

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Ah, yo.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Cult of the Lamb isn't your first update.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Cult of the Lamb's multiplayer,

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000
so I'm gonna force Shibi to play it with me.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.000
I still have my Pokemon card game on Game Boy.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Yeah, gonna go to work, see you next stream.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Yeah, I'm ending.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000
We're gonna redirect into Shibi in 20 minutes, okay?

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.000
You should play with us as cultists, then starting.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000
I don't know how the multiplayer works,

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
but we'll see.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Cult of the Lamb is Twitch integration.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.000
I don't know if YouTube wants to do that kind of in-game integration or not.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Damn, it feels like the stream just started.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000
I mean, in terms of insurance, yeah.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Have you ever played War Thunder?

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Yeah, I saw it.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
It's local co-op. I could've sworn.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000
As all they said, I had multiplayer on my co-crazy.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000
What are you doing after stream?

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000
I'm gonna make a cup of tea to soothe my throat,

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000
and then I'm going to

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.000
message clippers

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.000
to go and check any clips that the girls might have had.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.000
And then I'm gonna get a manicure and a pedicure.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
I can't believe I'm saying that, but yes,

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000
I'm going to get a manicure and a pedicure.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.000
And then I'm going to edit some ASMRs

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000
in preparation of getting monetized,

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
so I can upload those 1k special videos,

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000
and I will probably write the script

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000
for the pregnant with you ASMR

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
that I want to make,

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000
and I'll most likely contact an artist as well

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
about it.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
But yeah.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Quite a few things I need to catch up on,

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
especially with the insurance streams.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.000
I'll probably be listening to Shibi in the background

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
as she plays.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
So whoever said War Thunder,

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
you only play that game if you hate yourself.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000
But yes, I have a big day, big day.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000
I don't know if I should show a picture of my feet

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
and hands afterwards,

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000
because some people don't like streamers

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.000
that do hand cam or whatever.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
I'm very sorry if, you know,

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
get filler, get filler, get filler,

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
but yeah.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Literally tomorrow you get to see my hands.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Wah, whilst I eat the American candy.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Wah!

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.000
I get to try A&W visages

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
as like a cream and soda I said,

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
but I don't normally drink cream and soda.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000
And what other?

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.000
I think there is Twizzlers.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
There is like Spacey Hall,

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Cheetos or something,

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
or Takis.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.000
I get to try Takis, the scrawny grippers.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Wait, do you want me to put the feet in the stream as well?

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
I mean I can do it.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000
I can put my feet in the stream if you want.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Okay.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
You wish is my command.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
You guys don't understand,

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
like you may be used to streamers out here

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
that don't do what you want.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
You do not understand,

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
I will do what you want.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Send me what you want.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Let me know.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Like as much as I am in command of you,

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
you are in command of me.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
I will think of a humorous way

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.000
to incorporate my feet into more stream, okay?

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Call us kid names.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000
My little baby replay.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
We need the scrawny thighs.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Can I put thighs?

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000
I don't know.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
I've not decided on my outfit.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
I think I'm just wearing fishnets, I'm sorry.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
I can't believe I actually have to put clothes on

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000
for a vacant stream.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
You guys are terrible.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Please don't put on my smile.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Right, I'm just going to check Marshmallow.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Just because we're actually getting really close to the end.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Oh, that's a lot of Marshmallows.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Oh my.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
That was a lot more than yesterday.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
What's mommy going to do to us?

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Mommy's going to do whatever she wants to you.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Oh, sorry.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
I love your hypnosis.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I get happy every time I go under someone else's influence.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.000
I'm so glad I did so well during that section.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Oh, go, go, go.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Yeah, sorry, I'm reading Marshmallows,

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.000
but pretty much none of them can be said on stream.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Yippee.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000
This is the part where I'm supposed to be like a business person.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:28.000
I'm supposed to be like, oh, but what does my ghost do it?

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Are you a bit of a me?

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
And then, as far as wishing marks.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000
I mean, I could try and do hypnosis again,

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000
but it's probably not going to be that good.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000
I need to be in the zone to corrupt you,

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.000
but because I've been allowed to me, I feel like myself.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000
And I'm just some goofy dork, like honestly.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Business strongy, yapper strongy, professional strongy.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
I wear so many hats.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Why is animus showing us a strange coat of full stone?

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Not enough time.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
You're error, goofy dork.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Yay, communist home.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
I've already prayed in obedience.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Jokes on you, how many of them?

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Uh...

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Hey strongy, after a year of waiting,

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
you've really surprised me.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Well, I'm just...

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
I have been afraid to die for a while

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000
and decided I'd support your project regardless of the quality,

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
but the girls are great and the content is stellar.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000
I'm glad.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.000
I usually just work at lurk and watch streams,

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000
but I felt like I had to tell you,

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000
I love mommy and I love when she's...

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:58.000
and I love what she's done with the place.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
I love you too, little refling.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.000
I'm so glad you love the girls as well.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000
I was really worried that,

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
like you guys would think,

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000
like go support them, you know?

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Cause I'm like that.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000
She said she wasn't in a hidden program

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.000
and hope you're having as much as a good time as the reflings are

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000
and in any case, thank you.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Oh, I'm having a good time.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
The only reason I ain't doing insurance...

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.000
That's my voice and this is how I'm talking.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
I'm a little broken,

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000
but I can bypass that by whispering at the moment.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:46.000
That's the reason why I'm not doing an insurance stream today or tomorrow.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
But don't worry, you can fix me.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
I just need some of your ink, okay?

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.000
So send me your ink and marshmallow right now.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Wait, we got a tip. I need to read it.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Let me read it.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Airwind player, thank you for the tip.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000
blown away today.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Thank you for the hypnosis.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Look forward to what's to come.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Really amazed at how good this is going.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Much love, thank you.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Don't strain your voice by whispering too much.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:24.000
It's really weird because I broke...

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
So my voice has broken

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
and whispering breaks your voice further,

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.000
but I can bypass my voice right now by whispering.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
It's crazy. I don't know how it works.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
We whisper.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Yes, very inkable.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:47.000
The urge to use my tongue right now is very high,

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
but I shan't.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000
I won't refrain from such sins.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I won't refrain, okay?

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Getting to getting to getting incredible.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.000
But yeah, I'll go on vocal rest for today.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Because I don't have to record anything,

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.000
and I need to send collab partner scripts.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Wow!

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Sly Saber, thank you for the tip.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
It says, thanks for the ASMR.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Here's your inking.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
My voice is so broken.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Dainy, spainy, thank you for the tip.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.000
I just got some iron bread delivered shop.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.000
So I'll try scotch soda for the first time tomorrow on stream.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.000
When you try corn stuff, yeah, let's go.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I have iron bread too.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Actually, I'll drink iron bread with you.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Oh, you made me ink.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Like, it's supposed to be good for the throat, okay?

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.000
I'm so professional, okay?

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:09.000
But yeah, I will definitely take a really good look at marshmallows shortly.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
A lot of them cannot be said.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Mayhaps in membership streams.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
You never know.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Nine out of ten doctors recommend, oh yeah, our refling's doctors.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Good for the throat, sure.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.000
I mean, want to find her.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
This is terrible.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Don't you want to help me?

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Help me feel better.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Come on.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.000
If you can do something to help me, I'll be good, okay?

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
But you need to be good in return.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Be good for me.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Give me what I need.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Give me what I need.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
That's terrible.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Okay, no going under.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000
No going under.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Stop.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.000
It's just me.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I'm still memeing, okay?

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000
I'm still memeing.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Not a doctor, but three years into a doctorate.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.000
If mummy asks refling's answer,

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
what, another tip?

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Everyone player, thank you for the tip.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Yeah, help strongy.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:43.000
I don't know why sometimes message displays and then it doesn't display.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
It's been so silly.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Can you make your background go a bit faster?

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Right now, I don't think so.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:56.000
But I do have alternate dingy mobobbers.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Oh wait, here we go.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Are you ready?

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Wait.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Yeah.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
I can do like this.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
It's going so fast.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Do we need to slow down or do we need to speed up?

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
That's terrible.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Isn't it?

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Just terrible.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
But that's as fast as I can make it.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
So hopefully that's faster now.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Speed up or slow down?

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Yeah.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Okay.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.000
That should be the correct settings.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000
I think.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Trucks on you are always under.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Yeah, I get to set the pace.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Just don't make it too fast.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Don't want anyone out here.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Nero, thank you for the tip.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
He says all my ink belongs to you strongy.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
You just need to ask.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Have I broken you already?

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Am I alleged to break you?

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Have I still got the effect on my voice or is it normal again?

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Wait, what?

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000
What?

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.000
What?

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
My pupils are broken.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000
It's normal.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Okay, you broke us a long time ago.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Can't break what's already broken.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000
I see a few of you are already broken in for me.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
You broke me at a low.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Your hair looks like the famous spiral candy.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
I forgot his name.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
I don't know what it is.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.000
My seashells are my hair.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
I'm going to be honest, I wouldn't take much.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
It's over.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:21.000
That's cheating strongy.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Like, I will get my way.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
I said an ending stamina.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
I meant it.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
He broke me at you.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000
It's too far.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Your voice is so entrancing.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Yeah, when it's not broken.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Hopefully, I will do better soon.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.000
And I can have much more ASMR.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
I am folding like a towel.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
No thoughts, brain melted.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.000
An ending stamina gives me every day.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Yeah, it does.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.000
It should.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Should I do vocal requests

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
for the rest of the stream?

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
And you guys tape what you want me to say.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
It's the software format.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000
I did that under a surface ASMR.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000
There's only so much better I can draw.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
I'm just scuffle brain, okay?

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
I'm just a bit scuffle brain.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:35.000
I'm already folded and put up in the linen closet

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
ready for use.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
You want to...

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Shhhh.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.000
You're asking for all you want me

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
10 to 0.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.000
With only got 8 minutes left.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.000
8 minutes.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
I don't even know if I'm allowed to do it.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
You're kissing.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
My tummy's making a noise.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Can you hypnotize us to be good dogs

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
for Shabby's stream?

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
I would love to do that.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Can we do that?

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Can we do that?

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Can we please do that?

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Please, let me hypnotize you

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000
to be a dog for Shabby.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Please, please, please, please.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Let me set up for this.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
I'm so serious.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
I need to set up for this.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Hold on, let me drink some water as well.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
I'm so serious.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Oh, I am so serious.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Okay.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Let me just decrymify myself

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
because we're going serious mode.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Wait, I'll do one last calibration

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:12.000
because this iPhone is killing me.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Okay.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Okay.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Okay.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Let's get to work.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Oh, no, that's not it.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Oopsie, split the wrong one.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
There, there.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
I'm not the only one

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
that can look after you this way.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
In fact,

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
I have five more

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
that I refer to

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
as my daughters.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
There is one

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
who will join you soon.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
She will look after you.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
But there's a catch.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
What a wifling.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
You need to be well-behaved.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Okay.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Almost like a dog.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
You know how to be a good dog, don't you?

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
You need to be malleable.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Follow commands.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Be told what to do,

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
what to say,

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
what to think.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
You are nothing

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
but a pup

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
for her amusement.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
And in her,

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
you will amuse me.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
So be good.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Don't worry.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
It'll wear off soon.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
After her stream.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
But for now,

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
good pup speak.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
And they go

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
park.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Don't they?

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Yeah.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
And then

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
they wait

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
on the command

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
of their owner.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
You are owned.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Do you understand?

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
You do not have

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
free will.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
You're a mutt.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Ready to do the bidding

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
of your owner.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
So let her have fun,

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
okay?

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
And in turn,

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
you will have fun.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
And you

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
will have

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
fun.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
So don't think

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
not until you're told otherwise.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Because in three minutes

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
I'm going to hand

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
the imaginary leash

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
over

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
to your new owner.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Don't worry.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
It's temporary.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
But you'd like that, wouldn't you?

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Get to play with a new owner

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
for a while.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Good pup.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
You deserve some head pads, don't you?

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Oh, you're a good boy.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Such a good boy.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
And it feels so rewarding

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
that you're praised, doesn't it?

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
In two minutes

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
you get your new owner

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
just temporary

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
for a little while.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
And she'll give you

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
all the attention

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
you need.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
All little love.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
And I'll reward you

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
extra when you come back

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
to me, okay?

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
So you'll be a good

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
one-year little pup.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
I've taught you well.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
You know how to behave.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
So be good.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
In one minute

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
your new owner

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
will take your leash

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
and build you along

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
with her.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Okay?

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Good little pup.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Such a good,

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
good boy.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Oh,

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
I hear her.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
She's coming.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
I hope you're ready.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Zero.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Good dog.
