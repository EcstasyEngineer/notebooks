1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,880
I thought I would do some rambling again, I was shocked and I would do something to happen

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:23,680
because my little recording area is full of stuff, like I'm not even kidding, I'll kick

3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:34,560
my foot out just to give you an idea of how much stuff is in here, yeah, I had to do it for you

4
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:48,400
so, I have, I literally have a painlet, originally I was actually gonna do nail tapping ASMR because

5
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:57,280
I have quite long nails right now, but I think because my nails aren't fake, like if you get fake nails it actually sounds so much better

6
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:11,520
but I've got the end of a pen and then I have a plastic pen and I was basically just gonna tap on lots of different things

7
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:33,360
um, whilst I'm rambling, I'm gonna go ear to ear because people's, the people's have spoken and you guys seem to enjoy when I'm, I'm just going off my note and going off on one and like, don't have a script or anything

8
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,720
I don't even know if you can hear the tapping of it, right, so I'm just gonna focus ASMR

9
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:49,600
well, it'd be tap, this is actually a nail failure that I'm tapping on

10
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:57,040
so if I move a little bit you can actually hear the like, the grit, and the grit

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:09,200
the sandpaper grit, um, actually I'm pretty sure, like, um, I might hit it in my throat

12
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:22,960
since whenever I swallow my throat goes like, like a frog and that's why my ASMR is like, takes so long to hit it because I'm just, I'm hitting it in all these like, tiny little things

13
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:30,160
oh my god right, this is like the same, does anyone remember playing Star Wars Battlefront?

14
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:38,320
the very first game and then when it was the loading screen the thing would go de-de-de-de-de-de-de video

15
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,520
whenever I do tap an ASMR it keeps happening in my head

16
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:52,520
But yeah, so that's the pen against it, and then it, no, yeah the pen, and then there's the pen lid

17
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:59,520
which sounds a bit more, a bit more hollow, not to be confused with hollow life

18
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm so funny, how'd you know?

19
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,520
Actually, you know what, I will tell you some, that's behind the scenes

20
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:15,520
So apparently there's like AI subtitles now which saves me so much time

21
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:23,520
But unfortunately due to one whispering and two being Scottish, the, oh, I'm not supposed to swear

22
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,520
I'll take that out, I just swore there, but I've taken it out, I'm a good girl

23
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,520
Aren't you two, please don't punish me

24
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,520
Right, I'll dab on something else

25
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,520
I've got like a little wooden stick

26
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,520
Oh, I just, let's make a lot of words about it, what was I saying?

27
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,520
I don't know if we're gone

28
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,520
I know I mentioned Star Wars Battlefront

29
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,520
And then I took out an edit of subtitles

30
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:59,520
The subtitles can never freaking understand me, because I'm whispering and I'm Scottish

31
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:08,520
It's a nightmare, like, maybe one day technology will get advanced to accept the Scottish accent

32
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,520
But it's not happening today

33
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,520
So I have to like manually fix all the subtitles and it's like I may as well just do it myself at this point

34
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,520
Because it takes so much time to fix them

35
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:27,520
But I really like doing subtitles because I think it's harder for a folk to understand me

36
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,520
So I'd rather, I'd rather make my content

37
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,520
I'd rather make it accessible, even though technically I'm speaking English, but...

38
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,520
I just realised, oh my god, I could do ear tapping as well

39
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,520
That's where I'm tapping your ear, what are you going to do about it?

40
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,520
You're doing, you're doing

41
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
Oh, you're doing the other one

42
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
Oh my god, I can tap them at the same time

43
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,520
Oh yeah, that's right

44
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,520
That's where you better tingle

45
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,520
Okay, I definitely know

46
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,520
I was going to say polydactyl

47
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,520
What's that thing called when you're good with both your hands?

48
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,520
Instead of re-hand-dominated or left hand-dominated

49
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,520
Polydactyl? No

50
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,520
Oh my goodness, what's that word?

51
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,520
Oh, that's going to annoy me

52
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,520
Okay, this next object I'm tapping on, as you hear me bend over and literally pick stuff off the floor

53
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Professional ASMR, by the way

54
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,520
There's no way you're going to guess what this is

55
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,520
It's a headband

56
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,520
Does that sound like a weird headband? No

57
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,520
I've got one anyway

58
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,520
That's saying something mildly important

59
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,520
This is terrible tapping ASMR

60
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,520
He wrote this video

61
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
Actually, no one wrote it

62
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
This is called acapella

63
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,520
Acapella means singing without any music

64
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
Why?

65
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,520
This is like such a hole, like a deep

66
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,520
You know what?

67
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
You better start sounding like tapping ASMR

68
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
I'm going to beat you up with a headband

69
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,520
As with my nail

70
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,520
And that's it

71
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
With the freaking pinlet, it's not working

72
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,520
But yeah, if what we're saying is that the more organic ASMR is, it'll be done for the next thing

73
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
I got my question wrong

74
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,520
The more organic ASMR, because if I'm inclined to agree

75
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,520
Because if things start sounding a bit too professional

76
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,520
It doesn't like

77
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:20,520
It's not to say that someone with a professional level of recording doesn't provide tingles or whatever

78
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,520
But I have to admit, I like doing stuff off the top of my head

79
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,520
Even though I get distracted really easily

80
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,520
This is supposed to be tapping ASMR

81
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,520
And I'm currently squishing the fucking balls

82
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,520
So maybe you need to get back on track just a wee bit

83
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Oh, that's my walls

84
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
Wait, hold on

85
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,520
Hold on

86
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,520
I need to pick up the pen again

87
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
I'm trying to make it work with the damn pinlet

88
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,520
But the pinlet doesn't even make any fake noise

89
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,520
Okay, the actual plastic pen makes noise

90
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
Oh yeah

91
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,520
Actually

92
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,520
Oh yeah, baby

93
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,520
Yeah, fuck we're saying the kind of like when I just do my own thing

94
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,520
And do it in the script

95
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,520
Like, I don't mind a roleplay, then you get me a role, me

96
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,520
I've got a good roleplay in my way to use the kitchen, the bathroom, the bedroom, wink, wink

97
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,520
But it's kind of fun just to do it off the top of my head

98
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
Because I don't feel like pressure

99
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,520
I don't feel pressure to perform like right now

100
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,520
I'm just memin'

101
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Once it's good to tap and noise, hold on

102
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Put that down real quick

103
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,520
As you hear me drop on the floor

104
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Yeah, like, I don't feel pressure

105
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,520
I feel like this is just more, I don't know, griffin' off

106
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,520
Some people really will enjoy

107
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,520
Professional use more

108
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,520
But it's just not for me because it just, I don't know

109
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,520
It's not that it feels lifeless or anything

110
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,520
That's completely not at all

111
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,520
What the situation is

112
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,520
But I don't know, it's just nice to meme about

113
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,520
Not take things so seriously

114
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,520
And definitely not either

115
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,520
Again, delay for me

116
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
Ooh, really fast and slow, it's more

117
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,520
I've always wanted to make a fast ASMR

118
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,520
But I feel like it sounds so bad, like

119
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,520
Yeah, you tingle in your fuckin' bamboo

120
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,520
I'm so, maybe you tripped it

121
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,520
Okay, it's fine, I'll leave it in because it was actually merely humorous

122
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,520
But yeah, like, I don't know how fast ASMR is for me

123
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,520
Because I'm like, isn't this supposed to be a sleep-lake?

124
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
Shouldn't it not just be like

125
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,520
And good night

126
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,520
And relax

127
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Well, you know, where like, I feel like fast ASMR is like

128
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,520
Like, I don't, I don't find that relaxing at all

129
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,520
But that shows me

130
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,520
And if it's not getting that, like, I'm ticked a

131
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,520
And what ASMR you get, like, all of a sudden you like that ASMR

132
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,520
You're not getting that ASMR

133
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,520
But now I have to request it

134
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,520
Like, honestly, I don't mind requesting ASMR

135
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,520
All it does not bother me, like, some creators don't like seeing it

136
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,520
Although I do understand, like, if a creator uploads something

137
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,520
And then, like, the comments are immediately like

138
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,520
All kias apart, all kias apart

139
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,520
And it's like, bro, I literally just spent so much time making a part one

140
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,520
At least let the video, like, I don't know, be birthed already

141
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Like, it literally just came out of the birth canal

142
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,520
Let it grow, like, arms and limbs and stuff

143
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,520
Wait, no, let it grow

144
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Let its freaking bones, like, I don't know

145
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,520
Get, get hard

146
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,520
If you didn't know when you're born as a baby

147
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,520
All your bones are like, wobbly and like, jelly and stuff

148
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,520
I've forgotten the word for when your bones get hard

149
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,520
It's like ossification

150
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,520
Oh, that's the word, it's ossification

151
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,520
And that's why, because you're born with, like, over 300 bones

152
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,520
But I think you end up with, like, 204

153
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
I think you're born with 314

154
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,520
And then you get, like, 204 by the time you're an old far

155
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,520
And, so yeah

156
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,520
Now you know, you've been educated against your own

157
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,520
Oh, I should do education ASMR because that stuff bids people to sleep, like, so quickly

158
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,520
Like, when you're getting forced to learn something

159
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
Your brain just starts tuning up

160
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
Okay

161
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
This is my favorite

162
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,520
Scottish fact

163
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,520
Well, it's not fact about Scotland

164
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,520
But it's a fact

165
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,520
Because I'm Scottish

166
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,520
Right, I'll just say the sentence

167
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,520
So if you think to yourself

168
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,520
What do seeds need to grow?

169
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,520
But you say it in that accent

170
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,520
W-O-T

171
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Or wet water

172
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
Right

173
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,520
And in order for a seed to grow

174
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,520
They need water

175
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
Water

176
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,520
And then the O is oxygen

177
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,520
The breath

178
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,520
And then T is temperature

179
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,520
Because they need to be able to germinate

180
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
At a suitable temperature

181
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
And for each seed it's different

182
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
Because, you know, you can get tropical seeds that come from a climate

183
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,520
Or you can get hardy plants

184
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
Like, for example

185
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,520
Potato

186
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,520
And onion

187
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,520
They're considered hardy plants

188
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,520
Because they can survive quite low temperatures

189
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,520
Without perishing

190
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
I think cabbage is one as well, actually

191
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,520
But again, it depends on the type of cabbage

192
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,520
Because of the way that humans have

193
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,520
Cultured

194
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
Cultured plants

195
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,520
That's not wrong

196
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,520
That's like, oh, we give

197
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
We give at the mouth

198
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,520
A guitar, now the guitar's part of this culture

199
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,520
I don't mean like that, like, cultivation

200
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,520
Oh, it's hard

201
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,520
To have been ASMR, by the way

202
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,520
I think I may have been used to

203
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Just doing these ASMRs

204
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,520
No one is asleep

205
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,520
I'm just

206
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,520
I'm just feeling myself, okay?

207
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,520
Hold on, can this stop?

208
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,520
Oh, yeah, you look that double

209
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,520
You want to guess what this is?

210
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,520
You will never guess, and others

211
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,520
What I'm currently mucking about with

212
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,520
It's a freaking, it's a wire

213
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,520
Protective plastic paper

214
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,520
You put the wire through

215
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,520
Like, I'm saying this ASMR can be resourceful

216
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,520
Yeah, okay, you don't need like

217
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,520
Fucking super expensive equipment

218
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,520
I should know I'm the one who spent

219
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,520
The one who owns expensive equipment

220
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
But anyway, yes

221
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,520
What was I saying?

222
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,520
Plants

223
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Oh, that's a bit high pitch

224
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,520
I like the deeper

225
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,520
Deeper tabs, yes

226
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,520
Deep

227
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Do you like the deep?

228
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,520
I mean, you don't like it deep, don't you?

229
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,520
What was I saying?

230
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,520
Oh, like

231
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,520
Yeah, like humans have evolved

232
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,520
Plants

233
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,520
I forgot the word

234
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,520
Where it's like you take the tomato

235
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
And it doesn't really look like tomatoes

236
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Until they do today

237
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,520
And it's like, obviously

238
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,520
Supermarkets only offer

239
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,520
Like certain kinds of fruit and veg

240
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,520
And all that, but there's so many variations

241
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,520
So there's absolutely beautiful

242
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
Like some people listening right now

243
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,520
I'm gonna pull your mind

244
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,520
Did you know that there's purple carrots?

245
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,520
But they don't sell purple carrots

246
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
In the supermarkets because the average

247
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,520
Jewel only knows that there's orange carrots

248
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,520
And purple ones are too stark

249
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,520
But there's so many beautiful

250
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
Crops out there that we're just not

251
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,520
Exposed to like corn, for example

252
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,520
You can get multi-colored corn

253
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,520
That's right, not yellow

254
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,520
You can get purple, you can get

255
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
Little red ones as well

256
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,520
It's absolutely beautiful and amazing

257
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
And nature can genuinely be so pretty

258
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
And it's such a shame that

259
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,520
It's like hidden away from us

260
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,520
And tucked away from us

261
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
Because you'd never know better until you like

262
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
Go out there and reach out

263
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,520
And get this information to you

264
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,520
Instead of the information

265
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,520
Like coming to you or being passed out

266
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,520
Now some people might have like

267
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Shifts out to their parents and maybe

268
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,520
They were exposed to like rich

269
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,520
A rich diversity of fit

270
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,520
And that's amazing

271
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Like that's actually bulk jumping all that

272
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
But it's like such a shame for the people

273
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,520
Who never get to experience it

274
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,520
Unless they like accidentally stumble

275
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,520
Like this is the fastest pace

276
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,520
More whispering before

277
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,520
Then you slow down

278
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
I should probably try and slow down

279
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,520
But I'm actually

280
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,520
Like genuinely passionate about it

281
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,520
And I think it's really important I'd love to do some

282
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,520
Educational stuff sometimes

283
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,520
I'm just not very smart myself

284
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,520
But like just because you're a bit daft

285
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,520
That doesn't mean you can't learn and it doesn't mean

286
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,520
Like you actually

287
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
Can't try and teach others as well

288
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,520
Because if you didn't know

289
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,520
The best way to learn something

290
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,520
Is to actually teach someone else about it

291
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,520
It's like an interesting thing

292
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,520
I think it's like if you write it down

293
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,520
You're like 5% gonna remember it

294
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
If you teach it to someone

295
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
You're like 70% gonna remember it

296
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,520
Or something that's quite fantastic

297
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,520
Like honestly human psychology

298
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,520
And the mind is like really fascinating

299
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Like we humans are such simple creatures

300
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
Like we crave

301
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,520
We crave like communication

302
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,520
We crave passing down knowledge to one another

303
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,520
No matter how big or no matter how small

304
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,520
Or

305
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,520
I just

306
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,520
It's beautiful, you know life's beautiful

307
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,520
If you look for the little things

308
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,520
And you know I think maybe

309
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Some people take things like literally

310
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
Like all these flowers are beautiful

311
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
This life is beautiful

312
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
And it's like nah come on

313
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,520
It's about the way you smile things in life

314
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,520
Like the things that make you giggle or post mail

315
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
On your face like

316
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,520
Again if you go for a wee walk

317
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
And there's a wee bird that's screaming inside

318
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,520
And it's like really annoying

319
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Like that bird's just calling out for

320
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
A wee mate or it's calling out for

321
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
His partner and being like I got some food

322
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Go get it and it's like

323
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
I can appreciate that, that's it

324
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
That's a word

325
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
We should appreciate

326
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
And it's like

327
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
You didn't just learn it

328
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,520
Well you do learn it, I appreciate things

329
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
And you have to practice it as well

330
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
Like you can't just wake up and be like

331
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
Oh I am pure thankful that

332
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,520
Of you know I can move my toes

333
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
Today or whatever

334
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
Like

335
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
You just have to genuinely practice it

336
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
And it takes time like

337
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
I used to take the train to work

338
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
And it was absolutely beautiful

339
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
Like the sights that I could see were so beautiful

340
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
And the architecture of the buildings and all that

341
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
And I used to say to myself

342
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,520
Like you know what

343
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
I'm actually so lucky that I get

344
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
To witness all of this

345
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
Through my own two eyes and I get to experience it

346
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
And I get to experience

347
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
The motion of the train

348
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,520
And I get to experience it

349
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,520
And good morning to the ticket conductor

350
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,520
And like showing them that I've bought my ticket

351
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,520
And all that and

352
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
Like there's people on the train

353
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
Just enjoying looking out the window

354
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
And seeing the sights as well and it's like

355
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Can what at the end of the day

356
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,520
We're actually really lucky

357
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,520
And yeah you know what

358
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
I do apologize, I apologize

359
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
For taking it for granted

360
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,520
That I take my everyday life for granted

361
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
And like literally

362
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
I'm sitting in a booth right now

363
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
My re-recorded booth that I was able to afford

364
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,520
Because people are so kind

365
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,520
And like they either support me monetarily

366
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
Or they support me just by watching my content

367
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
Because they're like okay

368
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
I'll give out my time and attention

369
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
And it's like

370
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,520
It's just kind of hard to wrap

371
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
And comprehend and pretend

372
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,520
And this is just turning to a big old

373
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
Fucking it's not Japanese

374
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
More we all know that by now

375
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
Come on, come on

376
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
But like it's just hard to conceptualize

377
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
Like there's so many people out there

378
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
Rootin' for me

379
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
And if you're Aussie, no not like that

380
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,520
But also if you are Aussie, yes like that

381
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,520
And it's just

382
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
It's all

383
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520
Bizarre and wonderful life

384
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,520
We get to live like right now

385
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
In this moment, in this day and age

386
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
Like just it's hard to please

387
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,520
I'm totally going to swap that

388
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
Different type of thing next

389
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
Um

390
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,520
Um

391
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
Yeah just

392
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,520
You know and like

393
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
Like listening to my stories

394
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
I'm like what you like listening to my stories

395
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
For I'm such a boring

396
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
Mobile

397
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
But you know what

398
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
If you think I'm entertaining

399
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Then you know color me blushed

400
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
What did I even try and say there

401
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,520
Color me blushed

402
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
Okay

403
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,520
Like yeah just

404
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
You know

405
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,520
As the content creator

406
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,520
Say thank you and I know

407
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
I know I know or me

408
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
I've heard folks say thank you all the time

409
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
Or they didn't appreciate it and all that

410
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
But what else am I supposed to say

411
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,520
Like genuinely what else am I supposed to say

412
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,520
Like obviously I say thank you

413
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,520
And I like to think of my level

414
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,520
I'm gonna burp

415
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,520
That uh you know what

416
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,520
I'm gonna burp right in your ear

417
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
You're welcome

418
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
What was I saying

419
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,520
I've completely forgotten

420
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
Alright thank you

421
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
I like to think

422
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
My way of saying thank you is like

423
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,520
Doing these week of the videos and being like

424
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Oh thank you for 1k

425
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
Like use an ASMR video

426
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,520
Like it's a special special thank you

427
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,520
For just saying thank you like

428
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
Like oh I feel indebt

429
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,520
Just because of everything

430
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
That's um

431
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,520
That's like

432
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,520
It's just actual meant on me like honestly

433
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,520
But meant on a good way meant on me

434
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
It's like crazy but in a good way

435
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,520
Although it can be meant on a bad way

436
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
Like always meant on you know what I mean

437
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,520
Woah

438
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
I'm teaching

439
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,520
I'm gonna try hard and actually

440
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
Put you in sleep this time

441
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,520
Some people like

442
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,520
Like humming

443
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,520
Like to sleep

444
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
But my voice is not very good

445
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
I can't maintain that

446
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
Cause my voice is like being a bit

447
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,520
Robish

448
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
I don't even mind singing

449
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
A wee bit of Zelda you know what I mean

450
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,520
Like da da da

451
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
Da da da da

452
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
Bo bo bo da da

453
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,520
It's like so fast

454
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
I need to research like slow lullaby

455
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
I wanna make lots of videos

456
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
I wanna make a lullaby one

457
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Where I play with your hair with my nails

458
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,520
Cause I got long nails right now

459
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
Don't know if you can hear me

460
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
I mean yeah you can hear that cause I can hear

461
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
But you like

462
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
Play with your hair

463
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
Well stop

464
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,520
Sing slow lullaby

465
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,520
It's about to unravel lullaby

466
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
I can't wait to sing

467
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
Again

468
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
Okay well actually

469
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
Let's just nail tapping

470
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
I'm just cheating

471
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
But yeah I'll do like a proper nail tapping

472
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,520
One

473
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,520
When I get fake nails

474
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
Cause they use like hard acrylic

475
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,520
Oh my god acrylic is such a good

476
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
It's more wonderful

477
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
Acrylic

478
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
Oh my god

479
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,520
I just tingled

480
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,520
I didn't

481
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
I like I tingled a lot of stuff

482
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,520
If I listen back to

483
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
If I'm not talking again

484
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,520
It's not that I don't like my voice or anything

485
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,520
But I just like I can't even hear my voice

486
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Like I'm so used to my voice

487
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,520
I'm so used to my accent

488
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,520
It doesn't like have an effect on me

489
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
But if I do a really ugly hair

490
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Please it's my favorite tingle

491
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
Like hair brush and anything

492
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
I just

493
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
I'll just generally scratch my head right now

494
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
Don't mind me

495
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
But like those are my favorite ones

496
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
Oh yeah

497
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,520
Actually I want to do a video

498
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
Where I do everyone's favorite trigger

499
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,520
For like one minute

500
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,520
And the video is like an hour long

501
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
But everyone's just gonna say

502
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,520
You're the wicked one

503
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,520
But it's still a cute concept

504
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
I think you're just a little bit

505
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
To do ear kissing this morning

506
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,520
I really should probably stop doing this

507
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
Round plan once I keep

508
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,520
I come in, I genuinely think I'm like

509
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,520
Oh I'm gonna ease that

510
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,520
I'm gonna do so much ear tapping this morning

511
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
And then I never freakin' do it

512
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,520
I just get too excited

513
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
Okay

514
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
Can't blame me, I'm like a little

515
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
Little puppy, too excited

516
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,520
Maybe

517
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
I'll just, I'll do some

518
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
Ear tapping and then we'll all pretend

519
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
That we fail to sleep at the end

520
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Of the ear tapping and I'll

521
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
Like just do it for a bit

522
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,520
And then we can pretend it's a real

523
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,520
ASMR video whilst literally

524
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,520
No one fell asleep to it honestly

525
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
I say that as I drop some more shade

526
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
On the ground, oh wait I'm not

527
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,520
Dropping pen ASMR

528
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,520
We've had new ASMR triggers

529
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,520
Just dropped essentially me dropping a pen

530
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,520
On the floor, you ready?

531
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,520
Three, two, one

532
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
Whoa

533
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
But yeah, okay

534
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,520
I'll do ear tapping, I'm not gonna talk

535
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,520
Or anything else, I don't wanna ruin that

536
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
And then we'll all unanimously pretend

537
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,520
That this is real ASMR, okay

538
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,520
You like that? Okay, well done

539
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
Thank you

540
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,520
Thank you, thank you for

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
Thank you for tuning in, thank you for subscribing

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,520
And liking, and you know

543
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
If you know where it is in the showbiz baby

544
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,520
But hi, right

545
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
I'll do some tapping

546
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,520
But good night, sweet dreams

547
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
And um, see you

548
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
Tingle you in the next ASMR video

549
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
Let's go

550
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,520
I'm really glad I chose

551
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,520
But for serious

552
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
Please, please rest well

553
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,520
Um

554
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,520
Or continue to enjoy your days

555
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
I know some people listen when they're just like

556
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,520
Playing video games or whatever

557
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,520
Oh my god

558
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,520
Oh my god you're messing up in your video game

559
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,520
He's behind you

560
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
Bye

561
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,520
See you next time, okay

562
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,520
I'll call you

563
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
Bye
