1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,320
As if I'm doing a fricking startin' scene screen.

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,720
Who do you take me for, huh?

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,480
Who do you take me for, a professional streamer, me, start loadin' startin' streams?

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,080
I've no idea how low this game is gonna be.

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,440
We'll find out in a minute.

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,160
I may need to lower the settings as well.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,600
Hang on, I think this is a bit too cumbersome.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,080
Speaking of busting, ehm, there we go.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,080
No.

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:45,440
I'm done.

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,840
I'm done.

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,880
Johnny, please read the brainworms' marrows from half a day ago and begging and tapping

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:05,680
forward until I hear an answer for them.

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Riefling.

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:13,520
I don't know what's eatin' you up.

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,520
I don't know what's happenin'.

17
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,920
I've been havin' brainworms all night and it hurts a lot and I can't get rid of them.

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,040
Can you tell me you love me and that you like the things I make for you?

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
I'm not a second fiddle riefling.

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,040
I don't know what that means.

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,040
Are you the riefling that was upset I reacted to that song?

22
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,040
Riefling?

23
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,040
I don't know what's goin' on.

24
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,040
What's changed?

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,040
What happened?

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,040
Of course I love you, Riefling.

27
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
What?

28
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:51,040
Yeah, seeing you reply to that riefling and hearing the song on stream hurts.

29
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
The AI song?

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
Yeah.

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
Yeah.

32
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,040
I don't know what I did or said to it.

33
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:15,040
I mean, I don't normally reply on Twitter, I've been trying to do it a bit more.

34
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:25,040
So I'm trying to collect my thoughts in terms of what I've done recently that would be bad.

35
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:34,040
I thought we were done really good.

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,040
You're not the stream riefling, although I'm sorry I requested a certain stream or video.

37
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,040
I'm not trying to make an excuse so I was high at the time.

38
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,040
Someone says, I thought you didn't want AI content.

39
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,040
No, I personally will not monetize AI content.

40
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,040
If you make AI art of me, I'm not gonna stick it on YouTube, hopefully.

41
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
Is mommy low?

42
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:05,040
No, sorry, I'm looking away from the microphone to read the thingies.

43
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,040
I'm just trying to figure out what I've done wrong.

44
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:19,040
I don't want anyone feeling bad when they watch me, you know?

45
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
Is it the latest drama?

46
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
Just ignore the brain one.

47
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
What's the latest drama?

48
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,040
Oh god, is it a drama?

49
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:32,040
I thought the drama was found, though.

50
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,040
Which turned out to be a nothing bowl, nothing burger.

51
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,040
Is it a drama I don't know about?

52
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,040
Does someone want to give me a heads up and wash my face?

53
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,040
Did I miss something?

54
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Shibirate!

55
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:55,040
Oh my god, did you enjoy the...

56
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,040
Some fresh, needy drama at the end of the year.

57
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,040
I don't know what that means.

58
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,040
Hi, here I'm.

59
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,040
Did you enjoy your Elden Ring?

60
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,040
Oops.

61
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,040
I think the brain worms ate that refund.

62
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,040
I'm just trying to think what I've done wrong recently and I don't really...

63
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,040
Okay, I love you.

64
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
Thanks, mommy.

65
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,040
I don't know what I've done wrong recently.

66
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,040
Hi, here I'm.

67
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,040
You're gonna get a bit of deja vu.

68
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,040
I've been in the sleaze before.

69
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Hire on the streets and it's out of my time to go.

70
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,040
We are gonna play Titanfall 2 campaign just as a...

71
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
Oh god, that's loud.

72
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,040
Just as a warning, warning question mark.

73
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,040
I have played Titanfall 2 before, the campaign.

74
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Round two, yee.

75
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,040
And just to warn you, I am completely skipping the optional map.

76
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,040
I didn't realise the fights weren't even necessary.

77
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,040
So it's getting completely skipped.

78
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,040
So yeah, so I hope you enjoyed the Elden Ring.

79
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Gorilla.

80
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,040
Hope you're doing well on my birthday.

81
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
Happy birthday!

82
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,040
As long as you don't have my little pony profile picture.

83
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,040
Happy birthday.

84
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,040
That's Matt Mercer?

85
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,040
That's McCree?

86
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:37,040
That doesn't sound like McCree to me.

87
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,040
I'm gonna go for the world record and the...

88
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,040
I fuck know.

89
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,040
McCree on stream.

90
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,040
During this era, he was every white guy male protagonist.

91
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Doesn't he play Dungeons & Dragons on YouTube now?

92
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,040
Cinematic.

93
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,040
He's an attack and Titan as well?

94
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,040
He's a dungeon master.

95
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:21,040
He's Jotaro and Jojo as well?

96
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,040
How is his voice getting any rest?

97
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,040
What the fuck?

98
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Who's McCree? I think he means Coleslaw.

99
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Casserole!

100
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,040
I saw Titanfall move my butt here as well.

101
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,040
Aw, thanks.

102
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,040
Yeah.

103
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Yeah.

104
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,040
J. Cooper.

105
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Congrats if your name's Cooper.

106
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Let's see how much I can remember of this.

107
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Ooh.

108
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,040
That was a good one.

109
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,040
That was a good one.

110
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,040
That was a good one.

111
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,040
That was a good one.

112
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Ooh.

113
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
Are we fucking a giant robot?

114
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,040
Call me, call me Freddy cos we five knights in this robot.

115
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,040
That's not even a sentence structure.

116
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,040
Good try though. Nice attempt.

117
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Ditch the Black Ops 6 beta.

118
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Oh my god! I saw in Black Ops 6, apparently you can grab people from behind and talk to them.

119
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,040
I'm R-warding all of yous in Black Ops 6.

120
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,040
From what I've seen from the beta?

121
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:41,040
I can grab you from behind and talk to you in-game.

122
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,040
Do you understand?

123
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,040
I can literally hump you.

124
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,040
Congrats if your name's Cooper.

125
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,040
First, let us put on the, uh...

126
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,040
What sponsor of sales?

127
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,040
Oh, hell.

128
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,040
Shit must have power-cycled the simpods this month.

129
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Oh my god. Is that a Kiwi, bro?

130
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Bro, it's a Kiwi.

131
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Bro.

132
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,040
My god, what sensitivity are we looking at?

133
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,040
We're a bit sensitive.

134
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,040
We're a bit sensitive.

135
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,040
I mean, I, yes, the controls are fine.

136
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Up is up and down is down.

137
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,040
You already do that one.

138
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Drops weapon. Oh no, mommy got me.

139
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,040
You could already do that.

140
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,040
I'll see how it is.

141
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,040
If it's well received, we might play it.

142
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,040
It's bloody expensive.

143
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,040
Jesus!

144
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,040
All right, okay.

145
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,040
Okay, now I've just got here.

146
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Right.

147
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,040
How fast?

148
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,040
Is this fast?

149
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,040
I don't know if this is too fast for me.

150
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,040
I'm analizing, I'm analizing.

151
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,040
Backup six is going to include an ex ghost game pass.

152
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,040
Are you squiddin' me right now?

153
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,040
Regarding the drama, sometimes you can do nothing wrong

154
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,040
and we viewers will get in our own heads.

155
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,040
It's happened to me a few times with the other blue girls.

156
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,040
But I realized I was the problem, so don't worry about it, mama.

157
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,040
Well, thank you for the super chat, Sarah.

158
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,040
I was trying to think what I did wrong.

159
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,040
I was like, is it the shortest stream?

160
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,040
But it's like, I've kind of said why I did shorter streams

161
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,040
because I'm thinking my Bulbert, you know?

162
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
Oh god, my model is too bright.

163
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,040
Hold on, let's take the reactive model off.

164
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Real!

165
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,040
I'm going to whisper all up in your ear.

166
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,040
I'm going to be very ink from a boy.

167
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Oh, it's a spitfire.

168
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
He's my best weapon.

169
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
Oh.

170
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,040
I was going to say, I was like, why can't I shoot?

171
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,040
I thought the whole point of this game was to shoot.

172
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,040
Thank you, Stashfur again.

173
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,040
Got an embalm.

174
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Nope, can't be bothered.

175
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Let's go over here.

176
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,040
I want to get NBT because BT is refling and BFling is safe.

177
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
Oh, no.

178
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,040
Right, fuck it, let's just go.

179
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,040
I can't remember what I'm supposed to do.

180
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,040
What am I to do?

181
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
Am I to shoot him?

182
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Oh shit, I guess I'm to shoot him.

183
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,040
Whoopsie.

184
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,040
Yeah, that's right, you can't need ease.

185
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,040
Hold on a minute, I need to roll before I get you.

186
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,040
Oh shit, my accuracy.

187
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,040
I'm trying to get through this.

188
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,040
Stop running.

189
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,040
I'm trying to get it through it because I don't want to run out of time.

190
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,040
But my accuracy is so ass.

191
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,040
Did I finish?

192
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,040
I don't know.

193
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
Oh, there you go.

194
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,040
New best time on my note, sure, whatever.

195
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Oh, gorgeous.

196
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,040
We got 15 targets.

197
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Average speed 20 kilometers.

198
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
Wait, you don't see the username on the mirrors?

199
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,040
I logged in with my name thinking you could see him.

200
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,040
No, I don't see.

201
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,040
You would have to say no.

202
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
Oh, it doesn't show me shebees.

203
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Even though she's...

204
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,040
Oh, because I'm not in steam.

205
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,040
This would have shown me shebees.

206
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,040
Man.

207
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,040
Are you squiddin' me right now?

208
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,040
Where'd you from behind?

209
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
I'm hoppin' you.

210
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,040
I'm hoppin' you when I grab you from behind.

211
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,040
Am I to go again?

212
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,040
Oh, don't make me go again.

213
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,040
Yes, I'm all done.

214
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,040
Yes, I'm ready.

215
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
Thank you, chair.

216
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
Thank you, internet basil fail.

217
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,040
I just want to grab you in game in Black Ops 6.

218
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
I just want to grab you from behind and be like,

219
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,040
hey, little reflin', you sure do look very vulnerable.

220
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
Is that a pistol in my pocket?

221
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
Or am I just excited to see you, you know?

222
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,040
Is that a fairness in your pocket?

223
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,040
Or are you just really happy to be grabbed from behind?

224
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,040
Beat me!

225
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,040
Reflee!

226
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,040
I'm trying to rhyme it.

227
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,040
One we didn't have to steal from the IMC.

228
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,040
Go ahead, rifleman.

229
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,040
Go on your first take.

230
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,040
Call and press Vector.

231
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,040
Vector for Vilt.

232
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,040
And then the babies.

233
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,040
Alright rifleman.

234
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,040
Sounds like it's about to hit the fan.

235
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,040
I know.

236
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,040
And now don't make me pull out mummy ass.

237
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040
That's what I imagined.

238
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,040
Oh my god, I should do a really cruel audio like that.

239
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,040
Oh my god, and then you have to plead with me

240
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,040
not to pull out until I'm satisfied.

241
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,040
There's custom lobbies in Black Ops 6 of members.

242
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
I used to play tempo too, but no one would play with me.

243
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
External drive collecting doors.

244
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,040
Oh, this is sad though.

245
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,040
I never played this game multiplayer.

246
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
I don't even know if it is multiplayer.

247
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,040
Well, if the servers are still up.

248
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,040
Thumbs up! Thumbs up!

249
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
Oh my god, thumbs up emoji.

250
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
Cooper.

251
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,040
Anyone here call Cooper for no particular reason?

252
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
Congrats have some.

253
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
Right, I'm going to recommend a difficulty.

254
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,040
Let's do master difficulty.

255
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,040
Okay.

256
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,040
I like a challenge when I play my games personally.

257
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,040
Some people prefer just to go with the narration of the game.

258
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,040
Obviously the dev team do put a good bulk story behind it,

259
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,040
but I want a challenge when I play.

260
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,040
Yeah, master difficulty.

261
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,040
Still up just for hardcore gamers.

262
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
Titanfall multiplayer was still fun.

263
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,040
I'm sure I'm going to regret playing it.

264
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,040
I played the first one.

265
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
I missed a lot of things.

266
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Such a pro game.

267
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,040
MLG pro.

268
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,040
Hold on, I'm just going to very quickly go with the volume.

269
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
Just a tiny bit.

270
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,040
Because I can't hear those at all.

271
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
Because of the volume difference.

272
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,040
Typical nation. Thank you for the tip.

273
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
I kind of want to build those ships in space.

274
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,040
Did you see me leak my Pokemon TCG card opening?

275
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,040
I picked the perfect box for my goth ass.

276
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,040
I'm one, you guys might guess which Pokemon card box I ordered.

277
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,040
We're going down.

278
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
Fuck hell.

279
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
Gengar.

280
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
Pick another creepy one.

281
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,040
Pick another creepy Pokemon.

282
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
It's been described as uncanny.

283
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
Jack!

284
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Sorry, I just like scaring refunds.

285
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
If your name is actually that.

286
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
The Mimikyu one?

287
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
Yeah, it's Mimikyu.

288
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
I got a Mimikyu box.

289
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
I don't know.

290
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
Right, okay.

291
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,040
Sorry, I'm jumping in my chair right now.

292
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,040
And it's making my mouse do this.

293
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,040
But it's because I'm moving up and down in my chair.

294
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Oh, I died to that the first time I played.

295
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,040
I remember now.

296
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,040
Oh my god, this is just what's that game called.

297
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,040
Warhammer.

298
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,040
No, hell divers knock off because look, these are robots.

299
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,040
How are we looking for audio settings?

300
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
Is it too loud?

301
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,040
Are we doing alright?

302
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Are you friendly?

303
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,040
Are you friendly?

304
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,040
Oh, that actually scared me.

305
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,040
Oh my gosh.

306
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,040
That actually scared me.

307
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,040
Bruh, it's first thing in the morning.

308
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,040
Yeah, I just got fucking cock stomp.

309
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,040
Oh my god, that's so cool.

310
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,040
I don't know if it's just because I watched Mech Assault when I was younger,

311
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,040
but I have to admit a good Mech fighting game is so cool.

312
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,040
Baby, no.

313
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,040
War is hell strong, it is.

314
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,040
Oh my god, we have to watch him die in front of us.

315
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,040
I'm currently drinking my tea, so sorry for my tracking business.

316
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Have you ever played Mech Warrior?

317
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
I have not.

318
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,040
Danger, danger, danger.

319
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,040
I can't believe the Kiwis are the baddie.

320
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,040
Oh wait, it sounds more South African.

321
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,040
South African.

322
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,040
I love her, we're still on top of Mummy.

323
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,040
Is it getting in the way?

324
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,040
I might have to take the reflins off with me if it's getting in the way.

325
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,040
I have not had a chance to play Armored Core.

326
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,040
Get away! Get off me!

327
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,040
Go and start fighting or something.

328
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,040
Is it like Thanatars from...

329
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
Oh, get off me!

330
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
BT, you saved me.

331
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,040
Oh my god, BT, are you still...

332
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,040
Oh my god, I'm limping, BT's limping.

333
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,040
BT, 7-2, 7-4.

334
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Hi replaying, are you okay?

335
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Hi baby.

336
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
What's wrong?

337
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,040
What's wrong?

338
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,040
Oh my...

339
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,040
Hey captain, are you doing alright?

340
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
Are you feeling a wee bit rough?

341
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
Last emotion?

342
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,040
Are you doing alright son?

343
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Nah, you're feeling a bit rougher.

344
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
Damn.

345
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Oh shit.

346
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
Oh shit.

347
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
Oh my god.

348
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
What a dramatic fucking start to the game.

349
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Logbook updated, escaped.

350
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,040
I like that we buried them.

351
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
As humans in our burying wills.

352
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,040
In the future everyone has a British-adjacent accent.

353
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
You're a McWizard, are you?

354
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
Free Titan though.

355
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
Hi BT.

356
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,040
Are you here to protect me, Refling?

357
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
New user found.

358
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,040
First name, Jack Cooper.

359
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
Hi.

360
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Hi, Refling.

361
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Hi, Refling.

362
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,040
Initializing pilot combat systems.

363
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,040
Personal cloak, okay.

364
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,040
Ordinance, okay.

365
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,040
Firearms, okay.

366
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
Hi, Refling.

367
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
Are you okay?

368
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Power level critical.

369
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Scanning for sources.

370
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Insides, not viable.

371
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,040
Not viable, not viable.

372
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,040
I think we have our objective, don't we, Refling?

373
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Curry.

374
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
Insufficient power.

375
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,040
Hi.

376
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Hi.

377
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,040
The first words you ever spoke to me is power low.

378
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Insufficient power.

379
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,040
Let me recharge your batteries then, Refling, huh?

380
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,040
You need your mummy meter filled?

381
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
I'll fill them up.

382
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
What gun are you?

383
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
I would like this...

384
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,040
Oh, that's a shotgun.

385
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
I'm not really fussed about that.

386
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,040
You can only have one of my primary at a time.

387
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,040
Protocol 3, protect Womi.

388
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,040
Fill your battery up.

389
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,040
I'll get you nice and strong.

390
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,040
As I said, I have played this game before,

391
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,040
so I do kind of know what's coming up.

392
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,040
I'm on legendary difficulty,

393
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,040
so if I do get any damage HP, that's perfectly natural.

394
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,040
That's what's going to happen.

395
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,040
Pilot Helmets Collected, one of two.

396
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,040
Half away.

397
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,040
Half away?

398
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
Half away.

399
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
Thank you for becoming a member.

400
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,040
I'm so sorry I can't read that.

401
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
The one reason I mentioned some of the enders

402
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,040
are fantastic, EDA, my beloved.

403
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,040
We may have to play a MET game

404
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
that I've never played for the first time.

405
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,040
Armored Core seems to come up a lot,

406
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,040
so I think I'm going to be a cheeky wee shite

407
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,040
and do that.

408
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
I'm pretty sure I used to die here a lot,

409
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
because I don't have double jump yet.

410
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,040
Jump kit starts calibrating to new pilot.

411
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,040
Acquire the jump kit.

412
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Oh, the wall!

413
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,040
Oh, thank goodness!

414
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,040
I was like, please don't die already.

415
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
That's embarrassing.

416
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,040
That's genuinely embarrassing.

417
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
Okay, let's try that again.

418
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
There is a mis-input.

419
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,040
Mis-input!

420
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Calm the fuck down!

421
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,040
Are you squiddin' me right now?

422
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,040
Are you squiddin' me right now?

423
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,040
Protocol one, being a pilot.

424
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Protocol two, uphold the scuff.

425
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,040
Protocol three, protect mama.

426
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,040
I'm out of a beat.

427
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,040
I'm tempted to order an artwork

428
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,040
where you're somehow in the mech.

429
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,040
Right, okay, I'm going to say something really bad.

430
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,040
Like, really, really bad.

431
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,040
Okay, so there's artworks of D.Va's mech,

432
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,040
or animations of D.Va's mech

433
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,040
doing certain things, okay?

434
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,040
And I'm tempted to somehow order you as BT

435
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,040
in...

436
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,040
I'm tempted.

437
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,040
So, the artist that I'm currently working with

438
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,040
is doing some behind the scenes stuff

439
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,040
that I can't talk about yet,

440
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,040
until I can reveal it, obviously.

441
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,040
But I'm going to get her to swap to...

442
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,040
So, first artwork I need,

443
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
I'm going to do the cryo pod.

444
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,040
Because we played Halo!

445
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
Sorry, there was a grenade.

446
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
There was a grenade.

447
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,040
Because we played Halo,

448
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,040
I'm going to do the cryo pod.

449
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,040
It'll be rather emotional, so you better...

450
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,040
I think I'm going to put sensitive media tag on it

451
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,040
because I think it might upset you

452
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
with what I've got planned in mind.

453
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,040
Where am I going?

454
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
No one's no one.

455
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,040
Yeah, you ain't holding nothing off.

456
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,040
You ain't holding nothing off.

457
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
Right, okay.

458
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,040
No more grenades, okay, right.

459
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
Let's ride.

460
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
Then I'm going to get the anime watch long done

461
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
for that one scene.

462
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,040
That totally doesn't happen.

463
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Bruh, someone drop the spitfire right now.

464
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,040
I'll hook two on that thing to get it.

465
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,040
Give me the spitfire.

466
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,040
Spitfire.

467
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
Spitfire.

468
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
Spitfire.

469
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,040
Target lost?

470
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
Or target locked?

471
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,040
I heard someone here.

472
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
Oh, there you are.

473
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
I found him.

474
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
Was he really obvious?

475
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
And I was just blind?

476
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,040
Oh, jeez, that scared me.

477
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,040
Sorry, that scared me.

478
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Oh, good thing.

479
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,040
I'm just so MLG that I can sponge the bullets

480
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,040
even though we're playing on really difficult hard mode.

481
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
Oh, I'm about to run out of ammo.

482
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,040
Fine, I'll just need to pick up a new gun.

483
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
Who are you?

484
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,040
DMR.

485
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
Oh, this is a sniper.

486
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
I don't want a sniper.

487
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
Oh, come on.

488
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,040
I can't do anything with a sniper.

489
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,040
It's me, to be honest.

490
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
That's all I have to do.

491
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
Hi, I'm you here.

492
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
Hi, new.

493
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
I'm strongy.

494
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
Wait, no.

495
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
I'm supposed to say I'm dad.

496
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Fuck.

497
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,040
But yes, the artist is currently doing some behind the scenes stuff,

498
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,040
so I can't ask her to do any of our stuff just yet.

499
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,040
But I believe by the end of September,

500
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,040
oh, this gun's actually really nice.

501
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
What's this gun called?

502
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,040
I would like to pick it up more, please.

503
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
Yeah, I like that rapid fire on it.

504
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,040
D, no, that was a sniper.

505
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,040
The recoil is a bit rough from a distance.

506
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,040
It looks like the bullet fall off as well as a rather...

507
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
Oh, that's why...

508
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,040
Oh, that's why they're offering me this gun right here.

509
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
Hold on.

510
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
Hold on.

511
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Yeah, that's why they're offering me the sniper rifle right now.

512
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,040
Wait, they're surviving my bullets?

513
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Oh, they're not!

514
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,040
Wait, there's robots and...

515
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,040
Am I the one who meant them?

516
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,040
If I was in Titanfall 2, they'd call me the spitfire.

517
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,040
That's why they gave me that gun,

518
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,040
but I would like the other one back because I like the...

519
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Oh, I'm already out of fucking balls on it.

520
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,040
I don't even want a shotty.

521
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:00,040
I know exactly a static at the thought of having a shotgun.

522
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,040
I'm gonna have to be all up in it.

523
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,040
Here?

524
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,040
There's robots too.

525
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,040
We're getting closer to the battery.

526
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
Okay, they are giving me guns to pick from.

527
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Are we picking the hemlock?

528
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,040
Sorry, that scared me.

529
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,040
It's only because I'm on legendary difficulty.

530
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,040
Oh, this is a three-bar-spire thing.

531
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
Here?

532
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Okay, here.

533
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,040
You don't want the shawty, you just want the shawty,

534
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,040
like a melody in mind that I can't keep.

535
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Rogue got me singing like...

536
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,040
Oh, no, no, no.

537
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,040
They're scaring me.

538
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
Can I get a flattler?

539
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,040
What's a flattler?

540
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,040
That's literally the gun I started with.

541
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
There it is.

542
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Okay.

543
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,040
I got your...

544
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
I got your mummy batteries.

545
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
Spacey game.

546
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,040
The shawty wants the shawty.

547
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,040
Wait, yes.

548
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,040
I'm very excited about all the fun little artworks

549
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,040
I'm going to get some PM.

550
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,040
I just need to be patient,

551
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,040
because you know how it is with me daughters.

552
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
Daughters come first,

553
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,040
and we come together.

554
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,040
I was trying to get verified on BlueSight.

555
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
I feel bad for killing the wildlife.

556
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,040
It's not really their fault.

557
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,040
They just want a food.

558
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,040
Can I just...

559
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,040
What was I supposed to...

560
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Wait, sorry.

561
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,040
Hold on a minute.

562
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,040
Giant refilling as BT

563
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,040
that also comes with bonus functions

564
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
on the Titanium is in control.

565
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,040
Okay.

566
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,040
We ink all over the place together.

567
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,040
Oh, I think I just spanked your bottle a little bit there.

568
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
Sorry.

569
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,040
Thank you, the bitty lord.

570
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,040
I never expected that someone like her would play Titanfall.

571
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,040
You're going to shit yourself when you look at my make-a-sult gameplay.

572
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,040
Okay.

573
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,040
Hi, refling.

574
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,040
You going to feel better if I give you this, darling?

575
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,040
There you go.

576
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,040
How'd you feel now?

577
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,040
You feel better?

578
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
Uh-huh.

579
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,040
Oh, careful.

580
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,040
Careful, careful, careful.

581
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,040
I'm okay, darling, but what about you?

582
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
Hi, BT.

583
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
Hi, refling.

584
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Hi.

585
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,040
Yes, I can go get you another one.

586
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Yeah, what do you need?

587
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,040
How'd I get there?

588
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
Okay, back on the ship.

589
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,040
Okay, you wait here and be super safe.

590
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
Yeah.

591
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,040
Okay, okay, you help me.

592
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,040
You talk me through things.

593
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,040
That's how you hold my hand through games.

594
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,040
You talk to me.

595
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Why won't you talk to me?

596
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,040
But you did talk to me in-game.

597
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,040
Are you going to shit me?

598
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
Are you going to shit me?

599
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,040
Thank you, BT.

600
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,040
Hmm.

601
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
Voice analysis.

602
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,040
Don't worry, BT.

603
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,040
I'm not going anywhere.

604
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
Don't worry.

605
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
What am I supposed to go?

606
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,040
Ooh, not that way.

607
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,040
Whoa, whoa.

608
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,040
I mean, I'm not leaving you.

609
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,040
Refling, you're very literal sometimes, aren't you?

610
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,040
Very, very literal.

611
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,040
I think I did that way too-

612
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,040
Yeah, I did the-

613
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,040
Okay, let me try again.

614
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,040
Sorry, I did that way.

615
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,040
I hesitated.

616
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,040
I hesitated.

617
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,040
I hesitated, okay?

618
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,040
Don't laugh.

619
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,040
I hesitated.

620
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,040
Am I going mental?

621
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,040
That's why you don't hesitate.

622
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,040
Can I make this jump?

623
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,040
Oh, goodness golly.

624
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,040
Why is gravity my biggest, like, issue in games?

625
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,040
It's just fucking gravity.

626
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,040
It's not even anything difficult.

627
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,040
It's just parkour.

628
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,040
This is why we're not playing Mirror's Edge

629
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,040
before anyone requests Mirror's Edge.

630
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,040
I'm not even kidding.

631
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,040
Like, fuck, we're getting a Mirror's Edge stream.

632
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,040
I can't even keep up with it.

633
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,040
Bruh, let me reload.

634
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,040
Hold on.

635
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,040
Let me reload.

636
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,040
Ref.

637
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,040
Where the fuck?

638
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,040
What?

639
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,040
You want to play Prince of Persia?

640
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
Isn't that not another parkour?

641
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,040
The rock.

642
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Now I'm too high up.

643
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,040
Call me Japanese because I'm too high up.

644
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,040
I'm sorry.

645
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,040
That doesn't even make any sense.

646
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,040
I'm smoking the good kush because I'm too high up.

647
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,040
What the fuck are you saying?

648
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,040
How long did you serve with Captain?

649
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,040
Bruh.

650
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,040
See this gravity.

651
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
See this gravity.

652
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
I'm going to shag it.

653
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,040
Bruh.

654
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,040
How about dying late at all?

655
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,040
That'd be terrifying.

656
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,040
It's your arch nemesis.

657
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,040
It literally is.

658
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,040
So I can see I'm supposed to go yellow, yellow, yellow.

659
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,040
Jump off this to get the gravity.

660
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
Jump.

661
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
Jump.

662
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
And then.

663
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
All right.

664
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,040
Okay.

665
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,040
Well, of course the one time that I start seeing it out loud.

666
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,040
The laws of gravity.

667
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,040
I'm out of pizza.

668
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,040
Thank you, peppermint.

669
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
Thank you.

670
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,040
If you don't follow my Twitter.

671
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,040
I may have leaked.

672
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040
I may have leaked my schedule.

673
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,040
Now my schedule is always subject to change,

674
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,040
but if you want to take a peek.

675
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:09,040
I actually plan like my stuff like months in advance.

676
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,040
Cause I just really like streaming.

677
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,040
I mean, hell on the fourth of May we're playing Lego.

678
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,040
Where is that?

679
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,040
I can see it.

680
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,040
But it's not dying.

681
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,040
Like we're literally playing Lego.

682
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,040
Star Wars Lego on the fourth of May.

683
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,040
That's like how far ahead I plan.

684
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,040
Cause obviously may the fourth be with you fourth of May.

685
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,040
I can hear someone down here.

686
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
Yes.

687
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,040
Where's that guy?

688
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,040
Oh, there you are.

689
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,040
Why are you hating?

690
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,040
Ow.

691
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,040
What just hurt me?

692
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,040
What just hurt me though?

693
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,040
Something just caught me.

694
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,040
I got my winky.

695
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,040
Ow, my winky already quitted.

696
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
Can I get a...

697
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,040
I only have 10 bullets.

698
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,040
I'm better going in with a freaking sniper rifle.

699
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,040
4 AM as well.

700
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,040
I've never had a good...

701
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,040
I can hear someone.

702
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
But I don't see anyone.

703
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,040
Someone's here.

704
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,040
Where are you?

705
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,040
So I can snipe your freaking head off.

706
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,040
Are you there?

707
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,040
I...

708
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,040
I heard...

709
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,040
Oh!

710
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,040
Am I going mental?

711
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,040
Yes!

712
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,040
I saw it.

713
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,040
I missed.

714
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,040
Come on!

715
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,040
I'm getting fucking edged.

716
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,040
Alright, let's see what we're dealing with.

717
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,040
I'll take this.

718
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
Hold on.

719
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,040
Much better, much better.

720
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,040
Ooh, spitfire?

721
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,040
No, not yet, not yet.

722
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
Getting edged in the...

723
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
No, no, don't go up there.

724
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,040
There we go.

725
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,040
There we go.

726
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,040
Oh, yeah, yeah.

727
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,040
Now you all want to come out.

728
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,040
But when I have a sniper rifle...

729
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,040
Ooh, we're so scared.

730
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,040
Thank you.

731
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,040
Press and activate clock.

732
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,040
Wait, the clock was like five seconds, BT.

733
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,040
You didn't warn me about that, darling.

734
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,040
The...

735
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,040
The clock was like two seconds.

736
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,040
BT, I think you maybe should have warned me about that.

737
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,040
Weed it.

738
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,040
Oh, my melee isn't on.

739
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,040
Hold on, I need to put melee on.

740
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,040
Uh, difficulty master, or yes, that's fine.

741
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,040
Controls, melee, melee, melee, melee, melee.

742
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,040
Me, me, me, me, melee!

743
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,040
Me, me, me, me, me, me!

744
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,040
Me, me, me, me, me, melee, me, melee, me, melee, I'm looking for melee!

745
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,040
Am I going mental?

746
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,040
Crouch, sensitivity, ADS, response curve, dazzling, invertebrate,

747
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,040
and thanks vote controls.

748
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,040
I said controller.

749
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
No, I want voice and keyboard.

750
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:07,920
Controls. What? That was a mental. Why am I on control? Yeah, but why is it on

751
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,260
controller? How do I get off controller? I'm not on a controller, nor is my

752
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:21,000
controller plugged in. Oh, right now. Under the tech? Under the tech. Ah! Why the

753
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:30,080
fuck would it be over here? Melee. Why would it? Huh? It doesn't register my mouse for?

754
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:40,840
Oh, there you go. Sure. Okay, there you go. It works. Okay, sorry, that's a mate.

755
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:47,640
She's been a true PC gamer. It has to go in my mouse, or I can't do it. Like, I

756
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:53,600
will not melee for the entirety of the game if it is not on mouse for. BT? Who's that

757
00:38:53,600 --> 00:39:10,120
boy? Uh-huh. Sarah Briggs. It's getting a bit hot in here. It's getting a wee bit hot

758
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,120
in this ship. I'll tell you that much. Fuckin' hell. I feel like I'm in Barcelona.

759
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:20,040
Why is that fucking steaming up in here? Man, let's climb to the vents. Oh, wee bit of a

760
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:26,040
barbecue. Oh, my little toesies are getting toasty. Melee. Wait, how'd you say it?

761
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:36,120
I'm not saying Melee wrong, right? Oh, yeah. BT, you'll never guess what I've found for you,

762
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:43,400
buddy. BT ignored again. I'm so sorry. I'm like Melee. No, you're saying it fine.

763
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,040
Melee? I'm still saying Melee. Any Melee? Whoa. Are we done? Okay, we're done. Oh, BT,

764
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:04,360
I've got a surprise for you. Mummy's got a treaty, okay? I saw that helmet. Oh, no, no, I didn't

765
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:17,880
expect to go on it. One day, I will play a game where I don't die to gravity. Today is not that

766
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,920
day, though. And that's okay. Are you? Oh, right, I have a double jump. Thank you.

767
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:37,560
By what? I only see drones. Oh, they see me. I didn't realize they saw my location.

768
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:47,640
Where did the drones go? BT? Oh, daddy. I can't put it in you yet.

769
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:59,800
I feel very, I feel very baby when you're like this, Reiflin. I feel very baby. Like you're looking

770
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:12,440
after me. All yours. Yes. Hi. Oh, my God, Reiflin, you're fucking massive.

771
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:28,840
Uh, it's time. It's time. Well, pilot time. Hydration check.

772
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:37,240
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

773
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,960
Ink to pilot. Got it.

774
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:55,240
I was green, though. Reiflin and Johnny Culls.

775
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:04,760
Are to resume special operation 217 with Major Anderson of the SRS.

776
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:13,480
I'm detecting incoming enemy forces. Okay, show time. Reinitializing critical systems.

777
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:22,280
Vortex shield online. The vortex shield catches incoming rounds and missiles. Release the button to

778
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,640
launch any captured objects back at the enemy. Okay, okay, okay.

779
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:38,760
I like that one. Bunk. I like like a magician like, oh,

780
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:47,640
press Q to paint multiple targets. The longer you hold down the button, the more locks you will

781
00:42:47,960 --> 00:43:02,760
achieve. Okay, I likey. I likey. Bunk. Bunk. Oh, I'm slow.

782
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:15,080
Bunk. Oh, come on. This is so good.

783
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:22,120
Oh, yeah. Oh, no.

784
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,960
Are you sure about this?

785
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:35,880
Yes. Trust me. I trust you, Flynn. Right. Let's analyze what he does.

786
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:46,120
What's that? Get right. Get right.

787
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,040
Not bad, but I like how we have comms to each other.

788
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:58,120
I know this is your topic, which is obvious cause it's coming from me. Did you also listen to

789
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:03,720
some kinds of rock or metal songs? I don't normally listen to music. I'm sorry.

790
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:12,040
The vocal nation. I just listened to whatever happens to like, come on, but I don't like listen

791
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,240
to the radio. Have I gone the wrong way? I think I've gone the wrong way. Sorry. Sorry, I've gone

792
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:23,320
the wrong way. Yeah, she kind of just counter. Mummy actually getting skilled. No, like I don't

793
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,800
listen to the radio or like anything that's popular. And the nicest way, actually, when we hear

794
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:33,960
songs from Tick Tock, not even Lincoln Park. Is Lincoln Park the crawling in my skin one?

795
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:47,880
Crawling in my skin. I love them. Like I've heard of them, but like I couldn't tell you stuff.

796
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,040
Blood and rust.

797
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,640
Okay, sorry. I need to stop shaking my foot. That's me shaking my foot when I move like this

798
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,320
and it's moving my whole body. Yes, my foot is pressed against me.

799
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:14,520
Wait, why did you send that as a reasonable target? Oh, we have allies.

800
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,360
Oh, let's go. Hell yeah, it's BT.

801
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,800
Fuck no. Fuck no, I don't know when to give up. Oh, hold on a minute,

802
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:35,960
I need reload. This is embarrassing. Hold on. This is embarrassing. Hold on. Hold on.

803
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:44,520
I'm not ready yet. Hold on. Wait, let me. All right, let me get you first. Who next?

804
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:58,200
Oh, interesting. Don't care. Don't care. Shield a little to the front. Don't care.

805
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,440
Walk a little to the sides. Don't care.

806
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,600
Tighten logs. Press V to burst core. My ultimate.

807
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:17,560
Okay, press vector for my ultimate. Did you come from? Come on then.

808
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,160
Show me what I'm working with. You pussy.

809
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,040
What form?

810
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,160
Custom animation for death.

811
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:55,560
Okay. Hold on, let me reload. Pardon my French, but fuck them up. Light them up, pilots.

812
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,440
I didn't exactly get much on them. God, this guy is slippery.

813
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,680
And something's shooting at me, but I can't see it. I think it's other than him.

814
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,680
I'm gonna wish you were someone else.

815
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,160
He's on fire.

816
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:34,680
You're welcome. Yeah. Oh, I love unlocking new weapons.

817
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:39,800
New tired loader. Come on. Is this the Gatlin? Give me the Gatlin. Give me the Gatlin.

818
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:47,800
So now we no longer go... We go... Somebody's in love.

819
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:56,840
Adoration. Attraction. Devotion. I've not got the sword tighten unlocked yet.

820
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,840
I just died with it.

821
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,440
Are you playing you love me? You admit you love me?

822
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:12,440
You're 50% in love. I must win my love. See, everyone thinks titan falls a mech game? No,

823
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,520
it's a game where I must prove my love to you. This is a dating simulator. I don't care what

824
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:25,160
anyone says. This is literally a dating simulator. Right, so that's shield. Then what's my Q? No lock.

825
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,240
That looks like a lock to me.

826
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,440
Oh my god, I love it. Ultimate time.

827
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:45,000
Oh, this is such a good Q. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it.

828
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,440
I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it.

829
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:57,480
No, the Gatlin's a bit... Oh my gosh, I'm gonna have to get out of you, BT, but I love it.

830
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,080
Oh, it's sniping, get away.

831
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:08,520
It's a rom-com. It literally is. Right, am I supposed to get out of you? I think I'm. How

832
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:16,280
did I get out again? I don't know how to get out. Disembark, BT. Oh god, I don't know how to get out,

833
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:25,240
though. I forgot. How did I get out? What button? Nope, not that, whatever that was. Don't do that.

834
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:39,480
Um, tab? Caps lock? Shift? No, shift is zoom. Tangle, Y, U, I, O, P, L, K, J, H, G, M, N, B, V, C.

835
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:48,120
What is it? Hold E. Oh, there we go. We got out of there. Oh, I'm burning.

836
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:57,400
Oh my god, I'm so sorry. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. Did I do the fight again?

837
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:07,240
I'm so sorry. Where am I to go? How am I to get up?

838
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:18,360
I assumed to. Okay, definitely over here. Dumbass. Okay, let me get up. Let me get up. That was

839
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:23,080
embarrassing. I'm sorry, that was genuinely embarrassing. I completely forgot the whole point

840
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:30,040
is BT can stand in it and it's corrosive to my human body. Sorry about that, old chaps.

841
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,640
Oh, I didn't even know you could get up here.

842
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,280
Oh, literally the announcement in the background says requirement of wearing a hazmat suit at

843
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:50,840
all times. Where are you? A caber, a creeper. Did I go down or did I go along?

844
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:59,480
I go along. Okay. I'm sure there's probably like a helmet in that room or something and I've

845
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:06,040
just walked past it, but hey, oh, I'm gonna need to pick up someone's gun because I'm a bit of ammo.

846
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,840
Hold on. Right, don't open that gate. Yeah, I've not got a gun. Hold on.

847
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:16,120
Right, here we go. Now you can open the gate. Now I give you permission to open that gate.

848
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:21,960
BT is controlled by chat when you're gone. Oh, dude, how cute. I want to play. I wish there was

849
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,600
games like, I know we did stream sniping, but I wish there was also games where you could like

850
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,000
make stuff happen and like help me in my game. You know how like some...

851
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:41,240
Hi, baby. I think we're okay. Well, let's activate this.

852
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,040
Okay, please be careful, BT.

853
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,680
Like crowd control, like remontage and twist. I don't know what happened in

854
00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:02,680
remontage and twist if I couldn't. Okay, yes. I can do this.

855
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,680
Split up. It sends risky, baby.

856
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:18,760
I need my BT. I need my Weflin. You got it, darling.

857
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,560
BT, you do the same. Copy that, Violet.

858
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:32,920
Firestar Wildcard. Sorry, that's the exact thing. I can hear the radiation noise. Yeah, I...

859
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,200
What do you have here, my love? Do you remember?

860
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:47,720
Can I go in the war? That's okay. That's okay to me. That's all.

861
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:53,160
Oh, shit. I should have probably expected some sort of jump. Who was that guy?

862
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:10,280
Narcotics user. Narcotics class. I'm going to Harbass. Narcotics cow.

863
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:20,440
Okay, what are you? What are you? No, why do you keep giving me snipers? Give me ammo.

864
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,000
Just give me ammo.

865
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:35,880
Cane, you're a bad man. I'm coming for you, Cane.

866
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:42,760
Oh, shit. That's what I'm saying. They didn't give me ammo.

867
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,760
Everything is snipers. A wheel needs a sniper.

868
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:59,320
Everything. K-bar, K-bar, K-bar, K-bar, K-bar, K-bar, K-bar, K-bar, K-bar, K-bar, K-bar, K-bar, K-bar, K-bar, K-bar, K-bar, K-bar.

869
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:03,000
I get it. There's snipers in the game. I have a terrible absolutely horrific

870
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:11,360
Factoid though. I didn't like Cavers. I didn't like snipers. Sorry. I've not got that. I've not got the accuracy for it

871
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,720
No, you do not see oh, it's me

872
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,380
I was like, how can you see some moving in the pipes that doesn't make sense. I am the pipes

873
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,200
She missed the Spitfire. Oh

874
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:34,880

1046
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,040
This is not the loadout for me if I can hurt myself with my own stuff

1047
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:15,200
Okay, that didn't do anything. What does G do?

01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,120
No, I can't even talk to you

1112
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,080
I can't even talk to you

1113
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:38,720
Even though that was like a maybe a 45 degree acute angle just go for it. I'm going for it

1114
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,720
Be careful pilot

1115
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,600
Where do I go?

1116
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:53,920
There's a gun offered to me here, but what's that called devotion?

1117
01:17:53,920 --> 01:18:01,240
I mean, that's a bloody good. That's pretty good name for us a bit of a cheeky devotion. Where am I to go? Oh

1118
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:10,440
There's a hole in one of them like when you don't know what to do just go down the hole

1119
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,280
Ah

1120
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,040
Over qualified more like over

1121
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,200
Dead

1122
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,880
Right where we're going

1123
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,240
Don't you dare

1124
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:40,200
Don't you dare destroy my baby am I gonna get

1125
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,240
Over penetrated by bullets

1126
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:54,600
Thank you, thank you, right I I'm like 98. Yeah, this is the mission where you don't even have to fight

1127
01:18:54,960 --> 01:19:02,560
Like you can just keep going and obviously because I'm so MLG the bullets aren't even gonna grieve my skull

1128
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,640
Cuz

1129
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,360
literally

1130
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:15,480
You do not have to do any of this fight and the first time I played this through

1131
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:20,280
I was like doing all the fakes and I was like, why does this seem like it's going forever?

1132
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:27,960
It seems like it's going forever because it is it is optional to muck about okay, and I'm just skipping it cuz

1133
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:33,840
it's not even if it was paratips to the level sure

1134
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:35,920
but

1135
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:39,160
Literally, we just get thingy dover and over again

1136
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,280
I'm doing something

1137
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,800
I'm doing something

1138
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:51,200
Geez almost got fucking laminated

1139
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,600
Almost became as flat as a freaking squid

1140
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,600
Okay, that's not that way

1141
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:01,960
Don't care. Oh, maybe a little bit here. I

1142
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,880
Need to analyze what I'm to do

1143
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,280
Okay, I think I'm okay

1144
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,280
Invisibility good

1145
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,960
It only lasts like a millisecond, you know

1146
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,400
The hell are they building

1147
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,440
Mass producing homes

1148
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:31,840
They said we're gonna area we're gonna end homelessness. We've had enough

1149
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:40,400
They are grass on a metal plate. I can't remember what the big baddie secret was behind it

1150
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,680
I'm gonna get a couch put on my head and die. Aren't I?

1151
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:48,360
Okay, close enough. Okay. No target dummy

1152
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:55,600
Hold on easy easy take it easy take it easy

1153
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:57,800
Oh

1154
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:03,600
I see him. No. No, I see him. I think I'm gonna need to stay on the production line

1155
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:12,520
Shit shit shit do not stay on the production line. Oh my god. Did you see the way my body dunked it down?

1156
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,920
Right, don't stay on it get off it

1157
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:23,280
Hello looks like you're out to rescue a kidnapped but that's exactly what I'm doing right now

1158
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:28,240
They put dirt on the plate like that was the first that I hear you can have your your agriculture

1159
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:35,800
As I said, I'm just skipping the section because they just infinite respawn and I'm no mucking about what infinite respawn

1160
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:42,000
I'll blow them up they freaking scare the soul out of me

1161
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:51,040
Sorry the robot height and the human height is very different

1162
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,280
Why why why why so many I?

1163
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,640
Assume this is what I'm supposed to go on I

1164
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:04,360
Really hope this is what I'm supposed to go on cuz I

1165
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:10,480
Didn't look ahead. I'm gonna be honest. I'm not to go left or it looks like I'm supposed to go this way

1166
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:16,960
For safety reasons. I'm going this way because I don't know if I'm about to be tipped upside down

1167
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,280
I look like it's something

1168
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:27,920
I'm not very interested in music on this map is like wham-wham-wham-wham-wham-wham for the horns. Oh

1169
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,200
Peace off ghost

1170
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:33,960
I'm not a fan of those spider

1171
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,560
Let's try that again shall we

1172
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,920
I

1173
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:51,360
Am I supposed to go yeah, if I got the wrong way am I supposed to be on the production thing?

1174
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:54,600
I'm starting to think I'm supposed to be on the production thing

1175
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:01,400
I've gone the wrong way I should have stayed on how

1176
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:09,240
Hold on let me reload I went the wrong way. Let me reload

1177
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,440
So I know it does tip it tips

1178
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,280
What does it do?

1179
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:22,520
See this is what I don't like about the map like I wish it was just linear, but it's not

1180
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,680
So I need to jump back on it

1181
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:38,480
The horns be hornin right now. Oh wait a minute. I'm supposed to jump on here

Come on, we may need to get on it or we're gonna be in trouble

1330

Don't know what I'm shooting out. I'm sure not everything I

01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:30,200

1335
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:32,840
Yeah, okay, let's go

1336
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:36,280

1337
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:42,380
Have you ever thought of selling leaflings merches? Yeah

1338
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:46,440
It takes time and I

1339
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:50,640
Want us all to come out with it at the same time

1340
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,320
I

1341
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:55,880
Just need to get a date confirmed

1342
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:59,120

01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:31,240
I

1348
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:34,720
Exit the facility

1349
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:44,520
Let's go let's go let's go let's get the heck out of here cuz I don't trust it

1352
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:56,160
Yes, I

1353
01:39:56,200 --> 01:40:02,960
Spoke to the girls about it, but they weren't ready for it yet because it requires a down payment to produce

1354
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,480
And they were in

1355
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,320
You know obviously shame them here

1356
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:12,040
We're gonna have to put a debt above your head type thing is not really the funnest thing ever

1357
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:16,200
Obviously, they would keep 100% of the merchandise produced

1358
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:20,960
But they have to put a down payment and it would be like hey everyone has to get we cheeky day on them

1359
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:25,160
They weren't fussed for it yet, so I'm gonna ask them

1360
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:28,880
Again and see what we're thinking and

1361
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:32,240
I'm also

1362
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,480
gonna ask the

1363
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:43,240
If it seems like oh my god, yes, I forgot yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

1364
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:49,480
Oh, I'm gonna be wise enough to be able to do this. I don't think I'm smart enough for this

1365
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:52,880
I don't think I this one. I've always struggled with

1366
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:02,680
No, my god a scratch and snow stoning which is happened

1367
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:21,480
Wow, okay

1368
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:32,600
Hello, I would like to give my lecture and today we are going to be talking about drugs and why cocaine gives people an ego

1369
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:34,600
It's a very strange and unique phenomenon

1370
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:40,500
That gives an artificial boost to ego when normally it cannot be created through

1371
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Socialization in any other context. Would anyone have any questions about this?

1372
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:53,680
I'm ready to give my presentation on my drugs

1373
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,960
I'm supposed to go up here

1374
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:04,680
And

1375
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:09,880
We'd give super munchies. Oh, let me be clear

1376
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:16,920
They've been mean to the ball

1377
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:21,480
I

1378
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:26,280
Rather big

1379
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:30,880
Can you repeat that part of the stuff we said all the thing yeah, you forgot

1380
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,320
How'd I come down?

1381
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:37,560
BT is this where you were born?

1382
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:42,360
What is this place

1383
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:52,440
I drew since you think

1384
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:59,720
How many of the facilities these facilities are there in the eight standard months prior to operation brought sort

1385
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:04,440
Or destroyed over 29 such installations

1386
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:10,840
Take any full damage

1387
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,400
Thank you crazy Jesse we have hydrated

1388
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:22,760
I don't want to take fault. Can you see full damage in this game? I'm unsure

1389
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:26,840
Okay, I'm going to BT and I hope these guys don't attack me

1390
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:32,760
Hello

1391
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:38,040
I'm detecting traces of a massive energy explosion throughout this facility

1392
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:42,120
However, the ground the data does not detect the same in the other timeline

1393
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:48,440
None of these remains match the genetic profile of major Anderson. He may still be alive

1394
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:51,160
Uh, I can't remember

1395
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:54,280
I don't think he is

1396
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:57,720
I'm trying to remember but I can

1397
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:06,360
You're chassis time to earn my keep

1398
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:18,120
Okay

1399
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:21,080
He's so big

1400
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:24,760
Is that true? I was like something out of Pandora

1401
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:29,480
I'm sure there's a dog in here that scared me last time

1402
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:32,760
That like jump scares you

1403
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:41,480
Where is it I know for a fact I'm about yeah, I knew it you little shit

1404
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:47,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I knew it you scared me and I remembered the jump scare

1405
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:51,400
Oh, yeah

1406
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:53,960
Oh

1407
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:57,400
It's grabbing onto his hand to get the helmet like oh

1408
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:01,640
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear

1409
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:07,000
You freaked it all out. This isn't BT. I found Anderson

1410
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:16,360
No BT

1411
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:21,160
It's cold BT

1412
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:34,440
Raiflin, I know you're a little old baby, but Raiflin come on. You can't even be saying that

1413
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:37,800
Why did these grenades that show?

1414
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:40,600
Okay, I'll take a that show

1415
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:42,520
What is this?

1416
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,520
Oh, it's c4

1417
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:47,480
All right, look at my keyboard

1418
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:51,720
I will analyze it. Okay. Here you go daddy. All yours

1419
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:59,640
With the death of Anderson command of special operation 217 now transfers to you

1420
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:06,760
Congratulations on your field promotion by the coober the following is anderson's mission briefing from commander sarah bridge

1421
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:09,080
Okay

1422
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:14,840
Major anderson two weeks ago. We intercepted imc comms. They found something on titan

1423
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:20,840
A massive blast of energy was discharged at this location creating time distortion. Yeah, uh, I would see it

1424
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:25,240
Looks like a big old blast the energy. I don't know about you, but something big happened here

1425
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:29,880
This risk-mounted device we recovered during operation grizzly should protect you

1426
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:35,240
We know the imc have contracted cuban blisk and his mercenaries to protect something critical there

1427
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:41,480
So watch your back and anderson. You know how much I love writing death reports. So don't go alone

1428
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:44,120
The srs is a team

1429
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:49,240
That was sarcasm. She doesn't like writing death reports

1430
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:54,040
Congrats on your promotion. Why thank you. It worked very hard for it

1431
01:46:55,080 --> 01:47:00,440
Recommend we locate anderson's risk-mounted device before proceeding. Okay. I guess I'll go

1432
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:06,680
I didn't see a device on them though. You can see any device on anderson. It must be on the other half of his corpse

1433
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:12,440
I have to reach in the security services building. I will provide access

1434
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:15,400
Oh, is he gonna

1435
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,440
Uh, yeah, no

1436
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:32,120
It's gotta be an easier way, right?

1437
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:38,760
Okay, see you on the other side darlin. Bye. Bye

1438
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:43,800
Don't get kidnapped. I'm tired of you not having access to you anymore

1439
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
I need full access

1440
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:55,160
Oh, no the robots are asleep, but they wake up

1441
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:11,320
Oh

1442
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:18,680
No, no no, no no no no. This is creepy. Please

1443
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:25,320
This is horrifically creepy. There's no way. I'm dying to this. Am I dying actually? Oh my god. They keep coming

1444
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:28,840
No, just run they keep coming. I'm off. Bye. Bye

1445
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:36,420
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I completely forgot, but that I'm just running running running running running

1446
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:41,960
Running, running, running, running, running, run.

1447
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:44,920
Running, running, running, running, running.

1448
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:48,800
Oh my God, this is so strange.

1449
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:53,240
Yeah?

1450
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:54,500
Oh my gosh.

1451
01:48:56,660 --> 01:49:00,580
Was Your 올래� portraits gone?

1452
01:49:00,580 --> 01:49:01,620
All right, all right, all right,all right,all right,

1453
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:03,220
all right, all right, all right, all right, all right,

1454
01:49:03,220 --> 01:49:04,380
all right.

1455
01:49:05,380 --> 01:49:07,560
I forgot about that four.

1456
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:08,500
Completely.

1457
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:11,500
God, it's the other half of Anderson on his wrist.

1458
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:14,340
Oh, dear.

1459
01:49:15,820 --> 01:49:16,660
Oh, there he is.

1460
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:18,220
Oh, my God.

1461
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:20,660
That's like, how?

1462
01:49:20,660 --> 01:49:22,180
That's even worse.

1463
01:49:25,460 --> 01:49:26,540
That is so bad.

1464
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:30,820
Average position you're left in

1465
01:49:30,820 --> 01:49:32,300
once I'm finished with you.

1466
01:49:34,060 --> 01:49:34,980
He wall hacked.

1467
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:35,820
Right, what did I do?

1468
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:37,740
Press N to time travel.

1469
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:38,580
Okay.

1470
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:46,140
Okay.

1471
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:55,340
Okay, if it's easier to just,

1472
01:49:55,340 --> 01:49:56,300
oh, please don't get it.

1473
01:49:56,300 --> 01:49:58,860
I can't even remember what I'm supposed to do.

1474
01:50:00,140 --> 01:50:01,140
Okay, okay.

1475
01:50:01,140 --> 01:50:03,700
It's coming back to me, kind of.

1476
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,460
Should have been a kiddo.

1477
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:15,260
Oh, my God, I like that it tells you

1478
01:50:15,260 --> 01:50:17,340
that there's like radio signals.

1479
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:22,180
Okay, okay.

1480
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:23,180
I can do this.

1481
01:50:26,420 --> 01:50:27,420
I'm not doing that.

1482
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:28,460
I can do many things,

1483
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:30,300
but that is where I draw the line.

1484
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:34,100
I draw the line at those guys.

1485
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:35,300
What's going on here?

1486
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:37,620
Oh, it's the elevator shaft.

1487
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:39,020
It's the elevator shaft.

1488
01:50:39,020 --> 01:50:40,860
Oh, yeah!

1489
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:42,460
What happens now?

1490
01:50:42,460 --> 01:50:43,860
Oh, my God.

1491
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:45,860
Oh, raid.

1492
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:46,860
What am I raiding?

1493
01:50:46,860 --> 01:50:48,740
Oh, there's something after me.

1494
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:51,660
Raiding, I'm raiding.

1495
01:50:51,660 --> 01:50:52,500
I'm raiding.

1496
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:53,340
There's something after me.

1497
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:54,420
I can hear it.

1498
01:51:03,300 --> 01:51:04,620
Oh, my God.

1499
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:07,620
I'm cute.

1500
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:12,620
Okay.

1501
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:17,620
Okay, okay, okay.

1502
01:51:19,620 --> 01:51:20,620
Help step, pilot.

1503
01:51:20,620 --> 01:51:21,620
I'm stuck.

1504
01:51:22,620 --> 01:51:23,620
What is this?

1505
01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:24,620
No killing, am I killing you?

1506
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:27,620
Like, I'm playing on master difficulty, okay?

1507
01:51:27,620 --> 01:51:29,620
Excuse me for not wanting to engage in every fight.

1508
01:51:29,620 --> 01:51:31,620
I get scared and nervous, okay?

1509
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:33,620
I'm on my own.

1510
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:35,620
I ain't trying to do this on myself.

1511
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:37,620
I'd rather have a need for that, so...

1512
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:39,620
Oh, no, not dealing with you.

1513
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:45,620
I don't have to go this way.

1514
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:54,620
Yeah.

1515
01:51:55,620 --> 01:51:56,620
What's this?

1516
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:58,620
Bump, bump.

1517
01:51:58,620 --> 01:51:59,620
Bump, bump.

1518
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:05,620
Well, I'm supposed to jump down and then go bump.

1519
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:11,620
Okay, what's going on in here?

1520
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:13,620
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see.

1521
01:52:13,620 --> 01:52:15,620
Let me enilize, let me enilize.

1522
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:17,620
Decoding calibrating helmet.

1523
01:52:17,620 --> 01:52:18,620
Okay, okay, okay.

1524
01:52:19,620 --> 01:52:20,620
Anderson's over here.

1525
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:21,620
Hi, Andy.

1526
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:22,620
Hi, Andy.

1527
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:25,620
Congrats for your names.

1528
01:52:25,620 --> 01:52:26,620
Master difficulty easy.

1529
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:27,620
No.

1530
01:52:27,620 --> 01:52:28,620
We took it.

1531
01:52:30,620 --> 01:52:32,620
This is the first time I've seen this game,

1532
01:52:32,620 --> 01:52:35,620
but I had very different ideas of what this story was.

1533
01:52:38,620 --> 01:52:40,620
This one's empty.

1534
01:52:40,620 --> 01:52:42,620
The arc must be somewhere else.

1535
01:52:42,620 --> 01:52:44,620
Anderson out.

1536
01:52:44,620 --> 01:52:46,620
The arc is not here.

1537
01:52:46,620 --> 01:52:47,620
Oh, no.

1538
01:52:47,620 --> 01:52:49,620
Oh, no, the arc is not here.

1539
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:50,620
Checkpoint reached.

1540
01:52:50,620 --> 01:52:52,620
I saw this jump down, so that's supposed to be where I'm going.

1541
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:55,620
Oh, it's even worse!

1542
01:52:55,620 --> 01:52:58,620
Oh, it's even worse, it's even worse, it's even worse.

1543
01:52:58,620 --> 01:52:59,620
It's even worse.

1544
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:00,620
What's going on?

1545
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:01,620
Fuck it's separate!

1546
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:03,620
Everything's getting worse, it's getting worse.

1547
01:53:03,620 --> 01:53:06,620
I don't know what to expect when I'm running ahead.

1548
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:08,620
Cause I'm running around.

1549
01:53:08,620 --> 01:53:09,620
Whoa.

1550
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:10,620
Give me that.

1551
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:14,620
What's that?

1552
01:53:17,620 --> 01:53:18,620
I can hear stuff.

1553
01:53:18,620 --> 01:53:20,620
No, I'm doing a map.

1554
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:21,620
No map problem.

1555
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:22,620
So there's no map problem.

1556
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:23,620
It's not in my paycheck.

1557
01:53:23,620 --> 01:53:24,620
I'm out.

1558
01:53:25,620 --> 01:53:27,620
I'm too scared when I'm not in BT.

1559
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:29,620
Like, I feel so overpowering BT,

1560
01:53:29,620 --> 01:53:31,620
but then I feel so squishy when I'm not in BT.

1561
01:53:34,620 --> 01:53:35,620
Nope.

1562
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:39,620
I'm not doing parkour either.

1563
01:53:44,620 --> 01:53:45,620
Oh, gosh.

1564
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:50,620
Oh, my God, I don't have enough brain power to be doing this.

1565
01:53:51,620 --> 01:53:53,620
This is a bit too much for me.

1566
01:53:54,620 --> 01:53:55,620
Oh, shit.

1567
01:53:56,620 --> 01:53:59,620
Oh, my God, I don't have the brain power for this.

1568
01:54:00,620 --> 01:54:02,620
I'm just so hard.

1569
01:54:02,620 --> 01:54:03,620
Okay.

1570
01:54:04,620 --> 01:54:05,620
Oh, my God.

1571
01:54:06,620 --> 01:54:07,620
That scared me.

1572
01:54:07,620 --> 01:54:09,620
I thought I was safe.

1573
01:54:10,620 --> 01:54:11,620
No, there's too many.

1574
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:13,620
So I'm going back to the past.

1575
01:54:13,620 --> 01:54:14,620
There's too many.

1576
01:54:14,620 --> 01:54:16,620
There's unironically too many.

1577
01:54:16,620 --> 01:54:18,620
Why is there so many dogs?

1578
01:54:18,620 --> 01:54:20,620
In the facility?

1579
01:54:21,620 --> 01:54:23,620
No, don't start with the bots either.

1580
01:54:23,620 --> 01:54:26,620
I'm going to have to fucking pick the lesser of two evils.

1581
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:29,620
Then he's start.

1582
01:54:29,620 --> 01:54:30,620
Oh, my God.

1583
01:54:30,620 --> 01:54:31,620
I don't know who to pick.

1584
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:32,620
I don't know who to pick.

1585
01:54:32,620 --> 01:54:33,620
Give me the weapons.

1586
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:34,620
Give me the weapons, please.

1587
01:54:35,620 --> 01:54:36,620
Just anything.

1588
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:37,620
Oh, fuck it.

1589
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:38,620
The dogs.

1590
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:39,620
I picked the dogs.

1591
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:41,620
I think there's less of them.

1592
01:54:42,620 --> 01:54:44,620
Oh, my gosh.

1593
01:54:45,620 --> 01:54:46,620
Oh, am I okay?

1594
01:54:46,620 --> 01:54:48,620
Okay, there was less dogs.

1595
01:54:48,620 --> 01:54:50,620
See in the prison.

1596
01:54:50,620 --> 01:54:54,620
The prison has less enemies that I have to deal with.

1597
01:54:58,620 --> 01:54:59,620
What did I do?

1598
01:55:02,620 --> 01:55:03,620
I fucked up.

1599
01:55:03,620 --> 01:55:04,620
See, right.

1600
01:55:06,620 --> 01:55:08,620
Did I do something?

1601
01:55:09,620 --> 01:55:10,620
Right.

1602
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:11,620
Okay.

1603
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:13,620
Hmm.

1604
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:19,620
Oh, my gosh.

1605
01:55:19,620 --> 01:55:20,620
Okay.

1606
01:55:20,620 --> 01:55:21,620
Right.

1607
01:55:21,620 --> 01:55:22,620
I can do this.

1608
01:55:22,620 --> 01:55:25,620
Gravity is my friend.

1609
01:55:25,620 --> 01:55:26,620
I am smart.

1610
01:55:26,620 --> 01:55:27,620
I am wise.

1611
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:30,620
I am so good at this game.

1612
01:55:30,620 --> 01:55:31,620
Bitch!

1613
01:55:33,620 --> 01:55:34,620
Right.

1614
01:55:34,620 --> 01:55:35,620
Again.

1615
01:55:35,620 --> 01:55:36,620
Let me try again.

1616
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:37,620
Let me try again.

1617
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:38,620
Let me try again.

1618
01:55:38,620 --> 01:55:39,620
Hold on a minute.

1619
01:55:39,620 --> 01:55:40,620
Now, hold on a minute.

1620
01:55:40,620 --> 01:55:42,620
We go off to a bad start, but that was me.

1621
01:55:42,620 --> 01:55:43,620
Okay.

1622
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:44,620
Right.

1623
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:46,620
One, two, run.

1624
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:47,620
Jump.

1625
01:55:47,620 --> 01:55:48,620
Spawn.

1626
01:55:48,620 --> 01:55:49,620
Jump.

1627
01:55:49,620 --> 01:55:50,620
Spawn.

1628
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:51,620
Jump.

1629
01:55:51,620 --> 01:55:52,620
Spawn.

1630
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:53,620
Jump.

1631
01:55:53,620 --> 01:55:54,620
Spawn.

1632
01:55:54,620 --> 01:55:56,620
See, it's simple.

1633
01:55:56,620 --> 01:55:57,620
Easy.

1634
01:55:57,620 --> 01:55:58,620
Simple.

1635
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:00,620
No problems.

1636
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:02,620
No issues.

1637
01:56:02,620 --> 01:56:03,620
No fuss.

1638
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:05,620
No things.

1639
01:56:06,620 --> 01:56:08,620
We did it.

1640
01:56:08,620 --> 01:56:10,620
Easy peasy lemon peasy.

1641
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:11,620
Right.

1642
01:56:11,620 --> 01:56:13,620
Let's see what I'm looking at.

1643
01:56:13,620 --> 01:56:14,620
Hmm.

1644
01:56:14,620 --> 01:56:15,620
Mm-hmm.

1645
01:56:15,620 --> 01:56:16,620
Ooh.

1646
01:56:16,620 --> 01:56:17,620
Ow.

1647
01:56:20,620 --> 01:56:22,620
The entire thing is a power grid.

1648
01:56:23,620 --> 01:56:25,620
One, two.

1649
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:27,620
One, two.

1650
01:56:27,620 --> 01:56:29,620
One, two.

1651
01:56:29,620 --> 01:56:31,620
One.

1652
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:33,620
Please let me in.

1653
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:34,620
Cambly.

1654
01:56:35,620 --> 01:56:36,620
Okay.

1655
01:56:36,620 --> 01:56:39,620
And then a little 360.

1656
01:56:39,620 --> 01:56:44,620
I'm okay.

1657
01:56:48,620 --> 01:56:50,620
How did I do that?

1658
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:54,620
How did I not die there?

1659
01:56:57,620 --> 01:56:59,620
I don't know how I did that.

1660
01:57:01,620 --> 01:57:03,620
I actually didn't get it though.

1661
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:11,620
Who's your pilot?

1662
01:57:14,620 --> 01:57:16,620
Oh, well, he couldn't have died here

1663
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:18,620
because his body's not here.

1664
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:21,620
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1665
01:57:25,620 --> 01:57:27,620
That was Major Anderson's final recording.

1666
01:57:27,620 --> 01:57:29,620
His thing, bro?

1667
01:57:29,620 --> 01:57:31,620
Send a recon of this facility.

1668
01:57:31,620 --> 01:57:32,620
I may have a plan.

1669
01:57:32,620 --> 01:57:34,620
Meet me outside.

1670
01:57:34,620 --> 01:57:44,220
outside. Yes, please. I want my BT and there's something in my way.

1671
01:57:47,900 --> 01:57:52,620
Ooh, what are you? Oh my gosh, we're playing Fallout. It's a ghoul.

1672
01:57:57,020 --> 01:58:04,140
There's news. Oh yeah. No, that's, you can't do that, both. Leave me alone.

1673
01:58:04,780 --> 01:58:11,260
That's cheating. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't start scaring me now. This isn't a horror game.

1674
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:16,540
This is a rom-com with some guns. Okay, it's a rom-com with some guns.

1675
01:58:16,540 --> 01:58:28,220
I recommend you meet me at the rings in order to scan me. Maybe at the rings. Time travel.

1676
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:31,820
Hi.

1677
01:58:36,860 --> 01:58:44,060
BT, what are you fainting, darling? BT's not in this version of reality.

1678
01:58:46,700 --> 01:58:52,700
Can I come in? Please? Thank you. Let me deal with it.

1679
01:59:00,380 --> 01:59:00,700
Yeah.

1680
01:59:07,020 --> 01:59:11,660
Oh, BT can come with me. BT can come with me.

1681
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:19,100
I love it. No. Oh, sorry, I was trying to use my shield. They've changed it. There's no shield.

1682
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:24,940
There's no shield. There's no shield. They changed it. Hold on. Let me get rid of the big boys first.

1683
01:59:26,780 --> 01:59:31,740
Okay, fuck it. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1684
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:37,180
No lock, no lock. Right, let's get you.

1685
01:59:37,260 --> 01:59:42,620
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1686
01:59:51,980 --> 01:59:56,620
I'm to do what? Extend the bridge, fold weapon prototype? I don't know what that means.

1687
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:02,860
Okay, right. Is this what I was supposed to do? Tighten load out.

1688
02:00:03,820 --> 02:00:09,180
God, just stunning. I'm sure it's good. Don't care. Don't care. Like, I like my rifle.

1689
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:19,020
I have to get out of BT. I don't want to be out of BT. What do you do?

1690
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:27,100
Oh my god, I like this hacking.

1691
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:38,540
Scan it. Scan it. Oh, BT? Oh, don't do that to me. You scared me.

1692
02:00:42,620 --> 02:00:43,580
Okay, then open.

1693
02:00:48,780 --> 02:00:52,060
Wait, so what? We're running into it? Scan the arc at the center.

1694
02:00:53,020 --> 02:01:00,300
I don't recall. I don't remember. Are they fighting? Oh, no, they are fighting.

1695
02:01:12,860 --> 02:01:13,500
Did I die?

1696
02:01:23,020 --> 02:01:28,380
Did I die? Oh god, not gravity again.

1697
02:01:32,620 --> 02:01:33,340
Holy shit.

1698
02:01:37,100 --> 02:01:48,380
Oh, gosh. Oh, I messed up so badly. I am in so much trouble.

1699
02:01:50,380 --> 02:01:51,180
Can I grab you?

1700
02:01:52,620 --> 02:01:56,620
Percy.

1701
02:02:05,260 --> 02:02:06,620
This is what we came for, the arc?

1702
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:33,180
We did it. Take that damn glove off. We ain't Michael Jackson here.

1703
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:42,780
Okay, we did it. It's because like I'm familiar, but I'm like, I don't remember this.

1704
02:02:42,780 --> 02:02:45,900
I don't remember that happening. You broke reality.

1705
02:02:49,180 --> 02:02:52,380
The arc exploded during the test. It's the reason my timing is like,

1706
02:02:55,340 --> 02:02:59,580
remember that timing got out of the P-word and people were like, no, his music's so good.

1707
02:02:59,580 --> 02:03:01,820
I'm going to ignore that fact. And it was like, okay.

1708
02:03:01,820 --> 02:03:09,100
Damn, you can claim? What the fuck? When you claim me like a monkey.

1709
02:03:12,700 --> 02:03:15,420
Why did you do that? Let's hope.

1710
02:03:22,220 --> 02:03:22,620
Okay.

1711
02:03:22,860 --> 02:03:29,740
Okay. Yes. Can I go?

1712
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:34,380
Reefland, let me ensave you.

1713
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:42,380
Reefland, I just want to be insane. There's some nice and cozy I want.

1714
02:03:52,620 --> 02:03:54,860
You appear to be programmed to attack the control room.

1715
02:04:05,820 --> 02:04:08,700
I detect traces of poisonous chemicals within the fog.

1716
02:04:11,580 --> 02:04:13,580
What is in the fog? What is this fog?

1717
02:04:14,140 --> 02:04:19,180
Scanning. The ground fog is a toxic byproduct of the beacon power grid.

1718
02:04:20,140 --> 02:04:24,780
I recommend you embark when operating in hazardous conditions than one PPS.

1719
02:04:24,780 --> 02:04:26,380
You wouldn't let me ensane.

1720
02:04:29,660 --> 02:04:31,580
Okay, now I'm allowed to ensane. I'm happy again.

1721
02:04:34,620 --> 02:04:36,220
Press F1 for new alert. Nope.

1722
02:04:40,460 --> 02:04:41,900
Reestablish contact with him.

1723
02:04:42,940 --> 02:04:43,260
Yeah.

1724
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:47,020
Yeah, I'm here.

1725
02:04:49,180 --> 02:04:50,780
We're getting overrun by stalkers.

1726
02:04:50,780 --> 02:04:54,460
I recommend we eliminate these stalkers.

1727
02:04:54,460 --> 02:04:54,780
Yeah.

1728
02:04:57,420 --> 02:04:59,820
Okay, let's get rid of them on the wall first.

1729
02:05:05,420 --> 02:05:06,620
I can stand on them.

1730
02:05:14,540 --> 02:05:15,980
Would you like to be stood on?

1731
02:05:17,020 --> 02:05:17,500
Yeah.

1732
02:05:20,140 --> 02:05:23,740
Well done. This victory has raised our combat efficiency rating.

1733
02:05:23,740 --> 02:05:25,900
Oh, combat efficiency rating.

1734
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:30,140
AT 7274 to the militia forces. All threats have been eliminated.

1735
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:33,660
Human grunts give a different crunch.

1736
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:37,180
If it's mech assault.

1737
02:05:40,940 --> 02:05:46,220
Hello. Hi. I'm glad we could be of service when you needed it.

1738
02:05:50,140 --> 02:05:56,460
Hello. Okay, I guess I'm safe here.

1739
02:05:58,460 --> 02:06:00,620
What is the status of the beacon?

1740
02:06:01,340 --> 02:06:02,460
The power is shut down.

1741
02:06:03,740 --> 02:06:05,180
The power is shut down.

1742
02:06:05,180 --> 02:06:05,820
Mech power.

1743
02:06:09,020 --> 02:06:14,860
Designation. Arc tool. Function. Generates power up to five megajoules.

1744
02:06:15,420 --> 02:06:16,940
Ooh, a whole megajoule.

1745
02:06:17,500 --> 02:06:18,460
Can you repair it?

1746
02:06:19,420 --> 02:06:20,300
We already tried.

1747
02:06:21,740 --> 02:06:23,340
Yeah, we already tried.

1748
02:06:26,140 --> 02:06:27,980
Mommy at our first convention.

1749
02:06:27,980 --> 02:06:29,260
Would you like to be stood on?

1750
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:37,500
Are you actually good at this game?

1751
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:38,220
I bet you aren't.

1752
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:42,060
Yeah, I'm playing legendary difficulty.

1753
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:43,100
I'm really good at this game.

1754
02:06:46,780 --> 02:06:47,820
Super good at this game.

1755
02:06:48,460 --> 02:06:49,740
Super energy boost.

1756
02:06:51,820 --> 02:06:52,540
What am I supposed to do?

1757
02:06:52,540 --> 02:06:54,460
I'm out of way without BT again.

1758
02:06:54,460 --> 02:06:55,660
That's it. I've had enough of this.

1759
02:06:56,300 --> 02:06:57,180
I've had enough of this.

1760
02:06:58,380 --> 02:06:59,260
I want it.

1761
02:07:06,300 --> 02:07:08,860
You'll be getting squished on.

1762
02:07:10,540 --> 02:07:12,300
They made gravity tool, Pete, literally.

1763
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:13,820
Believe it or not, she still hasn't died yet.

1764
02:07:13,820 --> 02:07:15,580
I know, and I'm on master difficulty.

1765
02:07:16,540 --> 02:07:19,100
Rapid fire, ACMD.

1766
02:07:21,980 --> 02:07:23,100
Activate an arc tool.

1767
02:07:27,260 --> 02:07:28,780
Oh, I'm Baptiste, apparently.

1768
02:07:32,620 --> 02:07:34,300
Curious, curious.

1769
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:36,060
Hello. Can I come through, please?

1770
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:40,780
Yes, sir. I understand.

1771
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:48,300
Open door, please.

1772
02:07:49,340 --> 02:07:50,140
To go this way?

1773
02:07:51,740 --> 02:07:52,460
Oh, OK.

1774
02:07:52,460 --> 02:07:54,620
I thought he was going to open a door for me.

1775
02:07:54,620 --> 02:07:55,740
I was like, open this?

1776
02:07:55,740 --> 02:07:56,220
Let me, bro.

1777
02:07:57,420 --> 02:07:59,020
BT, what's up with these walls?

1778
02:08:07,820 --> 02:08:08,620
Yes, BT.

1779
02:08:10,460 --> 02:08:11,500
Remind me what I'm doing again.

1780
02:08:16,380 --> 02:08:19,740
I'm still zero death, so.

1781
02:08:23,660 --> 02:08:24,460
Still zero death.

1782
02:08:30,220 --> 02:08:31,020
Still zero death.

1783
02:08:31,980 --> 02:08:33,900
See that MLG-ness?

1784
02:08:37,820 --> 02:08:39,420
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

1785
02:08:39,420 --> 02:08:40,620
I didn't mean to kill that bot.

1786
02:08:40,620 --> 02:08:41,660
He was an aggressive.

1787
02:08:42,220 --> 02:08:43,260
That was really mean of me.

1788
02:08:43,260 --> 02:08:43,740
I'm sorry.

1789
02:08:44,460 --> 02:08:45,820
That bot didn't mean any harm.

1790
02:08:51,660 --> 02:08:53,420
Jeez, a whole mag?

1791
02:08:53,420 --> 02:08:53,980
Or am I just...

1792
02:08:56,860 --> 02:08:58,060
Jeez, Louise.

1793
02:09:00,220 --> 02:09:00,940
What does that do?

1794
02:09:06,220 --> 02:09:07,980
I'm already out of munitions?

1795
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:08,860
Please?

1796
02:09:13,260 --> 02:09:14,860
Yo, got some ammo back here?

1797
02:09:15,900 --> 02:09:17,020
Can he be out of it?

1798
02:09:17,020 --> 02:09:17,820
What's this?

1799
02:09:17,820 --> 02:09:18,620
El Star?

1800
02:09:23,180 --> 02:09:24,540
Interesting, curious.

1801
02:09:26,620 --> 02:09:28,460
Mummy lasso run win?

1802
02:09:28,460 --> 02:09:29,260
What's lasso?

1803
02:09:38,620 --> 02:09:39,100
Oh.

1804
02:09:42,220 --> 02:09:43,340
You didn't see that either?

1805
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:46,780
You didn't see both of those bits in combination?

1806
02:09:49,980 --> 02:09:51,180
Stop!

1807
02:09:51,180 --> 02:09:52,060
Don't laugh.

1808
02:09:52,060 --> 02:09:52,380
Okay.

1809
02:09:53,580 --> 02:09:54,700
How deep does this go?

1810
02:10:04,700 --> 02:10:05,580
What is this place?

1811
02:10:07,980 --> 02:10:11,020
It details this location that has the power grid for an IMC.

1812
02:10:11,020 --> 02:10:12,060
Interest in ruby kip.

1813
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:20,460
Zero death.

1814
02:10:20,460 --> 02:10:22,140
I don't know what the number 14 is.

1815
02:10:22,140 --> 02:10:24,140
Well, you want to count down for ASMR or something?

1816
02:10:24,140 --> 02:10:24,780
What's going on?

1817
02:10:26,220 --> 02:10:28,140
14, 13.

1818
02:10:32,940 --> 02:10:33,420
16.

1819
02:10:34,140 --> 02:10:34,860
Oh wait, count down.

1820
02:10:34,860 --> 02:10:35,660
You idiot.

1821
02:10:35,660 --> 02:10:37,180
13, 12.

1822
02:10:38,460 --> 02:10:38,960
Oh.

1823
02:10:42,060 --> 02:10:42,700
Softball?

1824
02:10:42,700 --> 02:10:43,180
What do you need?

1825
02:10:45,820 --> 02:10:46,060
Oh.

1826
02:10:48,060 --> 02:10:48,540
Oh, sure.

1827
02:10:54,060 --> 02:10:55,900
You want me to go here, BT?

1828
02:10:57,900 --> 02:11:00,620
Yeah, I'm still using the jetpack because, geez.

1829
02:11:02,140 --> 02:11:02,620
Tool?

1830
02:11:02,620 --> 02:11:03,820
Arc tool required.

1831
02:11:04,700 --> 02:11:06,220
I'm somewhat of a tool myself.

1832
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:08,700
The numbers.

1833
02:11:08,700 --> 02:11:09,420
What do they mean?

1834
02:11:09,420 --> 02:11:10,220
I don't know either.

1835
02:11:15,420 --> 02:11:15,900
Huh?

1836
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:24,860
Are you squiddling me right now?

1837
02:11:26,380 --> 02:11:27,660
If that's the case,

1838
02:11:27,660 --> 02:11:30,700
the reef flings are forgetting a few extra zeros.

1839
02:11:30,700 --> 02:11:31,740
Underscored angle.

1840
02:11:33,900 --> 02:11:35,100
Thank you, starch power.

1841
02:11:35,260 --> 02:11:35,900
Perfect.

1842
02:11:37,580 --> 02:11:39,020
Thanks for hanging those hooking hands.

1843
02:11:39,020 --> 02:11:39,740
Please don't worry again.

1844
02:11:39,740 --> 02:11:41,020
This is the longest we...

1845
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:42,540
Wait, what?

1846
02:11:42,540 --> 02:11:43,100
Turn it off?

1847
02:11:53,420 --> 02:11:56,540
Oh, I'm supposed to run against the Zamas.

1848
02:11:57,500 --> 02:11:58,140
Zamas.

1849
02:11:59,500 --> 02:12:00,780
Right, and then I'm to backtrack?

1850
02:12:01,340 --> 02:12:03,180
Yes, and that's with Arc tool.

1851
02:12:03,180 --> 02:12:04,300
Arc tool one.

1852
02:12:05,180 --> 02:12:06,140
With that Arc tool.

1853
02:12:14,380 --> 02:12:14,780
Huh?

1854
02:12:16,140 --> 02:12:17,260
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1855
02:12:21,260 --> 02:12:22,460
I did not like that one.

1856
02:12:22,460 --> 02:12:22,940
Okay.

1857
02:12:27,740 --> 02:12:28,220
Hello.

1858
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:31,900
Hello.

1859
02:12:35,180 --> 02:12:36,540
Can the Arc tool hurt them?

1860
02:12:38,060 --> 02:12:38,460
Maybe.

1861
02:12:39,820 --> 02:12:40,860
You're not the Arc tool.

1862
02:12:50,860 --> 02:12:51,420
What did that do?

1863
02:12:52,620 --> 02:12:54,060
I let me get across again.

1864
02:12:59,660 --> 02:13:00,700
Am I going to bake it?

1865
02:13:02,380 --> 02:13:03,020
This one.

1866
02:13:05,100 --> 02:13:06,780
We'd sink cool down in progress.

1867
02:13:08,540 --> 02:13:09,980
Did I need to like undo it?

1868
02:13:09,980 --> 02:13:11,340
Because it's not going to be permanent.

1869
02:13:14,060 --> 02:13:15,180
No, the marvins.

1870
02:13:16,300 --> 02:13:17,900
You took Marvin's only purpose?

1871
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:20,060
Wait, is that the name of the ball?

1872
02:13:20,620 --> 02:13:21,340
We Marvin?

1873
02:13:22,540 --> 02:13:24,460
Oh, it permanently stays up now.

1874
02:13:24,460 --> 02:13:25,980
Oh, I thought it was the only temporary.

1875
02:13:29,660 --> 02:13:32,380
Going to be a bit fucking went out.

1876
02:13:32,380 --> 02:13:35,660
Could you imagine the art or pain you'd be in

1877
02:13:35,660 --> 02:13:37,260
getting smacked in like that?

1878
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:37,900
Holy shit.

1879
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:42,540
Does it kill them?

1880
02:13:46,060 --> 02:13:48,300
No, it just disables them.

1881
02:13:54,700 --> 02:13:55,980
It doesn't tell them.

1882
02:13:59,100 --> 02:14:02,140
Okay, let's just met Irvin.

1883
02:14:02,380 --> 02:14:09,100
Oh, yeah, piss.

1884
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:10,860
Oh, yeah.

1885
02:14:11,660 --> 02:14:12,540
Oh, I'm falling.

1886
02:14:12,540 --> 02:14:13,340
I'm slipping.

1887
02:14:13,340 --> 02:14:14,300
I'm slipping.

1888
02:14:14,300 --> 02:14:15,580
I'm slipping.

1889
02:14:15,580 --> 02:14:16,380
And no, the good kind.

1890
02:14:16,380 --> 02:14:17,020
No, the good kind.

1891
02:14:17,020 --> 02:14:17,420
Right.

1892
02:14:17,420 --> 02:14:17,980
This looks right.

1893
02:14:17,980 --> 02:14:18,620
This looks right.

1894
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:26,220
Oh, sorry.

1895
02:14:26,220 --> 02:14:26,540
Hold on.

1896
02:14:26,540 --> 02:14:27,180
Let me do that again.

1897
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:31,260
I kind of said just like Tom and Jerry.

1898
02:14:31,260 --> 02:14:33,500
You know when Tom gets whacked and he goes, yeah.

1899
02:14:34,700 --> 02:14:37,420
I can't just send it like that in my head there.

1900
02:14:37,420 --> 02:14:39,100
Okay, let's try that one again.

1901
02:14:40,140 --> 02:14:41,500
Let's try that again.

1902
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:48,060
Okay, one, two, three, and hi.

1903
02:14:48,060 --> 02:14:48,460
I'm back.

1904
02:14:48,460 --> 02:14:49,020
How's it going?

1905
02:14:50,140 --> 02:14:50,940
Thank you.

1906
02:14:50,940 --> 02:14:51,660
Thank you.

1907
02:14:52,540 --> 02:14:54,220
I'm glad you found it impressive.

1908
02:14:54,220 --> 02:14:56,220
Became a werewolf for a second.

1909
02:14:57,020 --> 02:15:00,620
It's when I mess it off.

1910
02:15:00,620 --> 02:15:01,580
I'm like, oh.

1911
02:15:10,380 --> 02:15:11,340
Aware squad.

1912
02:15:13,500 --> 02:15:15,420
Have I ever get a Halloween outfit?

1913
02:15:19,660 --> 02:15:20,620
I'll get a werewolf.

1914
02:15:21,260 --> 02:15:23,100
I'll have a little waggly tail too.

1915
02:15:27,100 --> 02:15:28,460
What did we do?

1916
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:33,820
I kind of need to pee, but I want to keep playing.

1917
02:15:39,180 --> 02:15:39,500
This?

1918
02:15:44,380 --> 02:15:45,020
Yeah, let's hope.

1919
02:15:50,620 --> 02:15:51,100
Okay.

1920
02:15:51,100 --> 02:15:52,300
Okay, I'll be quick.

1921
02:15:52,300 --> 02:15:52,860
I'll be quick.

1922
02:15:54,860 --> 02:15:55,580
I'll be quick.

1923
02:15:56,540 --> 02:15:58,140
I can't remember what's inside.

1924
02:15:58,140 --> 02:15:59,500
I can't remember what's inside.

1925
02:16:02,140 --> 02:16:03,260
Okay, I'm ready.

1926
02:16:04,140 --> 02:16:04,860
I'm ready.

1927
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:05,660
Promotion.

1928
02:16:05,660 --> 02:16:06,460
I'm ready.

1929
02:16:06,460 --> 02:16:07,260
Promotion.

1930
02:16:07,260 --> 02:16:08,060
I'm ready.

1931
02:16:08,060 --> 02:16:08,940
Promotion.

1932
02:16:08,940 --> 02:16:09,740
I'm ready.

1933
02:16:09,740 --> 02:16:10,620
Promotion.

1934
02:16:10,620 --> 02:16:11,740
I'm ready.

1935
02:16:11,740 --> 02:16:12,540
I'm charging.

1936
02:16:12,540 --> 02:16:13,020
Hold on.

1937
02:16:13,020 --> 02:16:14,940
I'm getting fucking radiated to filth right now.

1938
02:16:15,580 --> 02:16:16,220
I'm charging.

1939
02:16:16,220 --> 02:16:16,780
I'm charging.

1940
02:16:16,780 --> 02:16:17,260
I'm charging.

1941
02:16:17,260 --> 02:16:17,820
I'm charging.

1942
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:18,460
Is that everything?

1943
02:16:18,460 --> 02:16:19,020
Oh, sorry.

1944
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:20,220
I need to reload one second.

1945
02:16:21,980 --> 02:16:22,700
I think I'm dying.

1946
02:16:23,980 --> 02:16:24,700
I think I'm dying.

1947
02:16:27,020 --> 02:16:27,520
Agh!

1948
02:16:35,900 --> 02:16:37,100
I don't really feel that good.

1949
02:16:37,100 --> 02:16:38,140
I feel like I've got radiated.

1950
02:16:38,140 --> 02:16:39,340
Blurgh!

1951
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:39,820
Radiated.

1952
02:16:39,820 --> 02:16:40,300
Blurgh!

1953
02:16:42,780 --> 02:16:45,260
A little bit of radiation sickness never hurt anyone.

1954
02:16:47,020 --> 02:16:48,460
You can't die in the room.

1955
02:16:48,460 --> 02:16:48,780
No.

1956
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:53,660
Ooh, crazy.

1957
02:16:56,220 --> 02:16:57,340
Full detected.

1958
02:16:57,340 --> 02:16:58,460
Emergency shutdown.

1959
02:17:04,460 --> 02:17:07,340
Captain, the uplinked targeting module is offline.

1960
02:17:07,340 --> 02:17:07,740
Yes.

1961
02:17:07,740 --> 02:17:08,860
Not good.

1962
02:17:08,860 --> 02:17:10,860
I've got the IMC here on their way.

1963
02:17:10,860 --> 02:17:12,220
That is a reasonable assumption.

1964
02:17:12,780 --> 02:17:14,620
McCord, can we bypass the module?

1965
02:17:14,620 --> 02:17:15,500
McCord!

1966
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:18,380
God, I've not had a McCoy's Crisp in so long.

1967
02:17:19,340 --> 02:17:21,580
The beef-flavored McCoy's Crisp.

1968
02:17:21,580 --> 02:17:22,140
Oh.

1969
02:17:22,140 --> 02:17:23,340
The situation could use us.

1970
02:17:23,340 --> 02:17:25,100
Sorry to go completely off topic.

1971
02:17:26,060 --> 02:17:28,300
The beef-flavored McCoy's Crisp.

1972
02:17:28,940 --> 02:17:30,780
The rigid Crisp of the cut.

1973
02:17:30,780 --> 02:17:31,900
The beef-flavored.

1974
02:17:31,900 --> 02:17:32,220
Oh.

1975
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:33,900
Oh.

1976
02:17:36,700 --> 02:17:37,420
I'm so sorry.

1977
02:17:37,420 --> 02:17:39,260
That was such a big side note.

1978
02:17:39,260 --> 02:17:39,580
Oh.

1979
02:17:41,980 --> 02:17:43,900
Beefy McCroy.

1980
02:17:43,900 --> 02:17:44,780
Oh.

1981
02:17:44,780 --> 02:17:47,740
I need to order some unironically.

1982
02:17:49,820 --> 02:17:50,380
I need me.

1983
02:17:51,020 --> 02:17:52,700
I need me that givna.

1984
02:17:52,700 --> 02:17:53,980
I'm working on stuff on this one's back

1985
02:17:53,980 --> 02:17:55,980
and then all of a sudden my mommy screams at my ears bleed.

1986
02:17:55,980 --> 02:17:56,460
That's okay.

1987
02:17:56,460 --> 02:17:57,900
I'm mostly still here.

1988
02:17:57,900 --> 02:17:59,100
Lord, the volume.

1989
02:17:59,100 --> 02:18:01,260
I think I'm going to have to start shrooms by saying

1990
02:18:01,260 --> 02:18:02,860
don't listen to me loudly.

1991
02:18:03,500 --> 02:18:06,860
Because when I get excited, or when I get happy,

1992
02:18:06,860 --> 02:18:08,700
I get really, really loud.

1993
02:18:08,700 --> 02:18:09,900
And that's not going to hurt you.

1994
02:18:11,180 --> 02:18:12,460
What's the fracture?

1995
02:18:12,460 --> 02:18:13,660
This fracture.

1996
02:18:13,660 --> 02:18:16,540
Fracture was the code name of a major combat review

1997
02:18:16,540 --> 02:18:19,180
in operation, conducted by the militia on the planet.

1998
02:18:19,180 --> 02:18:20,140
Ooh.

1999
02:18:20,140 --> 02:18:21,020
I didn't help myself.

2000
02:18:21,020 --> 02:18:23,340
It sustained many casualties, but the fleet survived.

2001
02:18:24,940 --> 02:18:26,620
We need to hear you though.

2002
02:18:26,620 --> 02:18:27,180
Isn't that...

2003
02:18:27,180 --> 02:18:29,580
Doesn't that have the microphone placed well enough near my mouth?

2004
02:18:39,740 --> 02:18:40,300
Oh.

2005
02:18:40,300 --> 02:18:41,500
I forgot about that.

2006
02:18:42,300 --> 02:18:42,620
Ah.

2007
02:18:44,300 --> 02:18:44,700
Yeah.

2008
02:18:45,660 --> 02:18:46,060
Okay.

2009
02:18:49,580 --> 02:18:50,860
That's rather low.

2010
02:18:50,860 --> 02:18:53,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2011
02:18:53,020 --> 02:18:54,060
That's kind of low.

2012
02:18:56,940 --> 02:18:57,740
Three knots.

2013
02:19:03,660 --> 02:19:04,780
89 kilograms?

2014
02:19:04,780 --> 02:19:06,140
I thought it was like 60.

2015
02:19:08,380 --> 02:19:11,660
BT, you didn't tell me I was freaking doing parkour.

2016
02:19:11,660 --> 02:19:12,140
Jeez.

2017
02:19:12,860 --> 02:19:13,740
Fucking hell.

2018
02:19:13,740 --> 02:19:14,620
Good throw though.

2019
02:19:16,940 --> 02:19:17,420
Ah.

2020
02:19:18,460 --> 02:19:18,940
Weird.

2021
02:19:23,340 --> 02:19:32,780
I cannot make the distance you'll have to toss me.

2022
02:19:33,580 --> 02:19:34,300
Don't tell me.

2023
02:19:39,500 --> 02:19:39,980
Oh.

2024
02:19:41,740 --> 02:19:43,260
Are you spitting me right now?

2025
02:19:43,900 --> 02:19:44,620
I do dare.

2026
02:19:44,620 --> 02:19:48,460
I do defy like the last thing I hear to be you voice honestly.

2027
02:19:48,460 --> 02:19:49,100
Oh, no.

2028
02:19:49,100 --> 02:19:50,940
But then you'll get like tinnitus

2029
02:19:50,940 --> 02:19:52,780
and you'll get like ringing with it as well.

2030
02:19:53,020 --> 02:19:53,820
Crazy, JC.

2031
02:19:53,820 --> 02:19:54,940
That's not good.

2032
02:19:54,940 --> 02:19:55,820
I don't give you...

2033
02:19:55,820 --> 02:19:56,380
Oops.

2034
02:19:56,380 --> 02:19:56,780
Ow.

2035
02:19:56,780 --> 02:19:57,100
Sorry.

2036
02:19:57,100 --> 02:19:57,980
I'm...

2037
02:19:57,980 --> 02:19:59,260
The only thing that can hurt my...

2038
02:20:00,380 --> 02:20:00,700
What?

2039
02:20:04,940 --> 02:20:05,660
Oh.

2040
02:20:05,660 --> 02:20:06,300
Jeez.

2041
02:20:06,300 --> 02:20:06,620
Lo-

2042
02:20:06,620 --> 02:20:07,100
WEEE!

2043
02:20:10,940 --> 02:20:11,340
God.

2044
02:20:11,980 --> 02:20:13,020
Are these real?

2045
02:20:13,020 --> 02:20:14,300
Why are they fluffing?

2046
02:20:15,420 --> 02:20:16,940
Why do they become powder?

2047
02:20:16,940 --> 02:20:17,260
Hold on.

2048
02:20:17,260 --> 02:20:17,980
Let me reload.

2049
02:20:20,620 --> 02:20:22,940
Am I powdering these enemies?

2050
02:20:23,580 --> 02:20:24,140
Hold on.

2051
02:20:24,140 --> 02:20:25,180
You become mine now.

2052
02:20:27,420 --> 02:20:27,740
Oh.

2053
02:20:30,060 --> 02:20:30,940
Okay.

2054
02:20:30,940 --> 02:20:31,740
You're mine now.

2055
02:20:33,420 --> 02:20:37,740
I'm not sure this gun is my particular best friend.

2056
02:20:40,620 --> 02:20:41,020
Hmm.

2057
02:20:43,820 --> 02:20:44,300
Okay.

2058
02:20:45,340 --> 02:20:47,100
I don't need a rocket launcher.

2059
02:20:48,540 --> 02:20:49,340
I will take you.

2060
02:20:53,820 --> 02:20:55,020
I'll take you.

2061
02:20:55,020 --> 02:20:55,820
Right.

2062
02:20:55,820 --> 02:20:56,300
Okay.

2063
02:20:56,300 --> 02:20:56,700
Uh-huh.

2064
02:20:56,700 --> 02:20:57,660
Mm-hmm.

2065
02:20:57,660 --> 02:20:58,860
This is what I'm talking about.

2066
02:21:05,660 --> 02:21:06,140
I did not...

2067
02:21:07,100 --> 02:21:07,420
How?

2068
02:21:08,540 --> 02:21:09,260
Fuck you, bitch.

2069
02:21:12,460 --> 02:21:13,020
No.

2070
02:21:13,020 --> 02:21:13,980
You're not...

2071
02:21:13,980 --> 02:21:14,460
What?

2072
02:21:16,780 --> 02:21:17,420
Oh, yeah!

2073
02:21:23,260 --> 02:21:26,380
I just saw you pop up the recommended channels.

2074
02:21:26,380 --> 02:21:29,100
Most likely because you're playing Titanfall 2

2075
02:21:29,100 --> 02:21:29,660
and I loved it.

2076
02:21:31,340 --> 02:21:32,700
Titanfall, very good game.

2077
02:21:32,700 --> 02:21:34,460
I've played it through once before.

2078
02:21:35,180 --> 02:21:37,900
I'm playing on super hard difficulty, wink, wink.

2079
02:21:40,060 --> 02:21:42,700
But hi, Ray, Ayanna, me.

2080
02:21:42,700 --> 02:21:45,100
Thank you very much for the super chat as well.

2081
02:21:45,100 --> 02:21:46,460
But yes, I'm enjoying it.

2082
02:21:46,460 --> 02:21:47,260
I just suck.

2083
02:21:49,580 --> 02:21:51,020
Okay, I have a better gun at least.

2084
02:21:51,980 --> 02:21:53,580
Oh, God, it's a three-burst fire.

2085
02:21:54,700 --> 02:21:55,020
Um...

2086
02:21:56,460 --> 02:21:59,900
I'm totally wink, wink, playing Master's difficulty right now.

2087
02:22:04,300 --> 02:22:06,700
Okay, I got quite the distance to go.

2088
02:22:06,700 --> 02:22:08,460
I can go the distance.

2089
02:22:11,100 --> 02:22:13,980
I have to go left to go right.

2090
02:22:13,980 --> 02:22:14,380
Got it.

2091
02:22:16,620 --> 02:22:17,740
Zero deaths, by the way.

2092
02:22:17,740 --> 02:22:19,100
The sucking is the best part.

2093
02:22:21,340 --> 02:22:22,460
When I keep playing the game,

2094
02:22:22,460 --> 02:22:24,700
and I don't stop even though I'm sucking, wink, wink.

2095
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:28,460
I do need a pee though.

2096
02:22:30,620 --> 02:22:35,180
Actually, I'm waiting for Azura to, you know, pee allure allegations.

2097
02:22:38,220 --> 02:22:38,620
Uh...

2098
02:22:41,100 --> 02:22:41,420
What?

2099
02:22:45,100 --> 02:22:46,620
I assume that's what I'm supposed to do.

2100
02:22:47,180 --> 02:22:48,060
Helmet!

2101
02:22:48,060 --> 02:22:48,620
I see it.

2102
02:22:49,580 --> 02:22:51,340
If I can grab it easily, I'll go for it.

2103
02:22:51,340 --> 02:22:55,260
But if it's going to make me do stuff to get it, I'll pass.

2104
02:23:00,220 --> 02:23:01,420
Grapefruit audio when...

2105
02:23:04,700 --> 02:23:05,100
Clunk.

2106
02:23:06,860 --> 02:23:08,220
That's as far as it'll go.

2107
02:23:11,660 --> 02:23:12,300
Have I missed?

2108
02:23:13,100 --> 02:23:13,580
Fuck it.

2109
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:14,940
Fuck it!

2110
02:23:18,780 --> 02:23:19,280
Flee!

2111
02:23:21,100 --> 02:23:22,620
Okay, MLG.

2112
02:23:22,620 --> 02:23:23,180
ML...

2113
02:23:26,300 --> 02:23:28,300
Call me Michael Jackson, because I'm MLG.

2114
02:23:30,220 --> 02:23:30,700
Wait, what?

2115
02:23:31,580 --> 02:23:32,060
Is that it?

2116
02:23:34,140 --> 02:23:34,700
And hold on.

2117
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:36,140
Hold on.

2118
02:23:36,140 --> 02:23:36,940
Take it back.

2119
02:23:36,940 --> 02:23:38,300
I take my last comment back.

2120
02:23:38,300 --> 02:23:39,100
Let me, let me up.

2121
02:23:39,100 --> 02:23:39,580
Let me up.

2122
02:23:40,380 --> 02:23:41,660
All right, go around.

2123
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:44,540
Oh, I need to go around, like, in a...

2124
02:23:46,300 --> 02:23:46,800
What?

2125
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:48,400
What are you?

2126
02:23:51,360 --> 02:23:53,280
I'm supposed to go around in a circle?

2127
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:53,760
Yeah.

2128
02:23:58,160 --> 02:23:59,200
Got a arm!

2129
02:23:59,200 --> 02:23:59,920
Okay, jeez.

2130
02:24:00,560 --> 02:24:01,840
Shit, I've already fucked it.

2131
02:24:02,480 --> 02:24:03,280
I've already fucked it.

2132
02:24:08,560 --> 02:24:11,280
Oh, I don't know how I'm making this arm.

2133
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:15,760
Mummy, you're not certified for that equipment.

2134
02:24:17,360 --> 02:24:18,640
Go squeeze the lemon.

2135
02:24:18,640 --> 02:24:20,400
Yeah, sorry, I was just saying.

2136
02:24:20,400 --> 02:24:23,920
Azura is confirming her peeler allegation first,

2137
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:25,520
and then I'll join in on the fun.

2138
02:24:26,720 --> 02:24:31,360
I thought it would be funny to do a denial kind of thing for a bit,

2139
02:24:31,360 --> 02:24:33,920
but I'm gonna start begging real quick

2140
02:24:33,920 --> 02:24:36,480
if you guys are like, you need to hide, jeez, and all that.

2141
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:39,920
Bro, I'm not even sure I want to go over there.

2142
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:44,800
Well, they're coming to me, so I've got my freaking not wish.

2143
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:45,680
Yeah, they're coming to me.

2144
02:24:46,560 --> 02:24:47,060
Bruh!

2145
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:51,840
Why are they so aggressive?

2146
02:25:00,400 --> 02:25:00,960
Come on.

2147
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:03,120
Any munitions.

2148
02:25:04,400 --> 02:25:06,480
Any munitions for a soft lamb.

2149
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:08,000
Master.

2150
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:13,280
No, you shouldn't see anything at all.

2151
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:14,240
Hey, hey.

2152
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:15,120
Oh, what?

2153
02:25:16,240 --> 02:25:18,400
Ooh, I see a pilot.

2154
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:22,160
What's this, a secret?

2155
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:23,280
No.

2156
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:24,640
A crate.

2157
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:29,040
I can hear them, but I don't see them.

2158
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:33,760
Great idea. Hydration chain.

2159
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:36,800
I'm a weakling.

2160
02:25:40,800 --> 02:25:42,320
No, not hostile pilot.

2161
02:25:42,320 --> 02:25:42,960
I'm friendly.

2162
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:43,760
I'm friendly.

2163
02:25:44,720 --> 02:25:46,320
Friendly weapon billets.

2164
02:25:46,320 --> 02:25:48,320
I like to share, you know what I'm saying?

2165
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:50,480
Okay, I'm getting walled by a robot.

2166
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:56,880
I'm fucking out.

2167
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:01,040
Some things are about to take me.

2168
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:01,360
Ooh.

2169
02:26:02,720 --> 02:26:04,400
Did you respawn when you...

2170
02:26:04,400 --> 02:26:06,640
Oh, no, I just killed a worker, but I'm sorry.

2171
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,760
I'm not really a fan of this gun.

2172
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:10,240
What are you?

2173
02:26:11,120 --> 02:26:12,640
Ooh, you're the sprayer.

2174
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:15,360
I do like to be the sprayer.

2175
02:26:16,640 --> 02:26:17,280
What's this?

2176
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:23,760
Check your HUD.

2177
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:24,320
I'm checking.

2178
02:26:26,240 --> 02:26:27,520
Ooh, juicy.

2179
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:33,760
No, I'm not trying to transmit from anywhere.

2180
02:26:33,760 --> 02:26:34,400
I'm a good...

2181
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:39,840
I'm a good little soldier that infiltrated your facility.

2182
02:26:40,560 --> 02:26:43,200
I'm a well-behaved good soldier, I promise.

2183
02:26:44,720 --> 02:26:48,560
I'm the nicest soldier that's ever infiltrated.

2184
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:50,400
Promise.

2185
02:26:51,360 --> 02:26:51,920
I promise.

2186
02:26:59,120 --> 02:26:59,520
Okay.

2187
02:27:02,480 --> 02:27:03,520
All the way to the right?

2188
02:27:04,160 --> 02:27:04,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2189
02:27:04,880 --> 02:27:06,320
That platform there, I see it.

2190
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:11,840
He's not dead yet because I'm so rude.

2191
02:27:12,800 --> 02:27:16,080
She's so brave and not afraid.

2192
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:18,080
Real.

2193
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:20,320
Okay.

2194
02:27:21,520 --> 02:27:23,360
Ooh, sometimes...

2195
02:27:23,360 --> 02:27:25,280
Sometimes a little scared, you know?

2196
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:26,720
Sometimes a little scared.

2197
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:28,000
Thunderbolt?

2198
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:29,600
Yeah, I'll take the fucking thunderbolt.

2199
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:30,160
What the fuck?

2200
02:27:34,240 --> 02:27:35,360
I'll take that.

2201
02:27:35,360 --> 02:27:36,000
What about this?

2202
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,200
Not those are fine.

2203
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:40,080
What else is shooting?

2204
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:45,920
I'll shoot these guys from afar.

2205
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:49,200
Okay, BT's like in that general area.

2206
02:27:50,880 --> 02:27:53,120
I'm a gentle infiltrator.

2207
02:27:53,120 --> 02:27:55,600
I asked for permission before I thrash anuses.

2208
02:27:56,240 --> 02:27:58,480
That's a reference, by the way, before anyone's like,

2209
02:27:58,480 --> 02:28:00,160
why did you just even say that?

2210
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:01,120
It's a reference.

2211
02:28:02,720 --> 02:28:05,440
It's a really good reference that not many people seem to know.

2212
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:11,680
The projector of the dish, got it.

2213
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:14,560
Move something.

2214
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:18,720
I'll like to take this.

2215
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:20,960
That looks heavy.

2216
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:27,920
Oh my god, I once got sprung.

2217
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:29,680
I thought I just heard Brian talking in there.

2218
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:35,360
What is this maintenance?

2219
02:28:35,360 --> 02:28:36,480
What's that crap?

2220
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:37,600
Come on, Ryan.

2221
02:28:37,600 --> 02:28:39,040
Watch some toy food.

2222
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:45,840
Right, go back.

2223
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:46,320
Go back.

2224
02:28:46,320 --> 02:28:46,800
It's fine.

2225
02:28:46,800 --> 02:28:47,440
It's not over.

2226
02:28:47,440 --> 02:28:49,520
Go back and then come forward again.

2227
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:50,400
Okay, let's try that again.

2228
02:28:50,400 --> 02:28:50,800
Hold on.

2229
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:55,600
One, two, brah.

2230
02:28:56,400 --> 02:28:57,440
What am I doing?

2231
02:28:57,440 --> 02:28:58,640
How have I done that?

2232
02:28:58,640 --> 02:28:58,880
Right.

2233
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:08,400
Okay, one, two, three, four.

2234
02:29:13,120 --> 02:29:15,360
You're requesting assistance, BT.

2235
02:29:15,360 --> 02:29:17,440
I'm on my own doing parkour.

2236
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:20,560
I need all the assistance I can get back.

2237
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:23,760
I think you would give me a jump pack.

2238
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:24,080
Jeez.

2239
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:28,160
No, I don't need you to analyze the terrain.

2240
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:29,600
I assure you, I know what to do.

2241
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:33,120
I just, I'm having difficulties with gravity at the moment.

2242
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:34,960
Okay, it's getting a bit difficult.

2243
02:29:34,960 --> 02:29:36,880
Okay, yeah, give me more of those platforms.

2244
02:29:36,880 --> 02:29:37,760
Not these ones.

2245
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:39,920
Ah, I'm getting a cramp in my foot.

2246
02:29:42,560 --> 02:29:45,200
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

Random cramp in my foot.

Ow, ow.

I don't really want to get in trouble because they have that aimed-down sight thing in mobile

02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
But that goes around. I don't know. I

2376
02:45:29,480 --> 02:45:33,040
Wonder if they can kill themselves with their own damage

2377
02:45:33,240 --> 02:45:35,240

2494
02:57:28,040 --> 02:57:30,040
I

2495
02:57:32,160 --> 02:57:34,160
Interact with it or just clear it like that

2496
02:57:35,880 --> 02:57:42,040
Yeah, right, okay, okay? See this is what happens when you there's anyone on it

2497
02:57:46,160 --> 02:57:48,120

02:57:48,120 --> 02:57:51,840

Kill

2502
02:58:05,400 --> 02:58:07,000

2503
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:11,720
Okay, right. Okay. Okay again. Just stand I understand

2504
02:58:14,880 --> 02:58:21,200
The broadside of a barn, okay, that was a checkpoint and let me guess go to the end one

2505
02:58:22,040 --> 02:58:24,040
What's my check point I

2506
02:58:38,680 --> 02:58:41,320
Mean I can see more of the map over there. Oh

2507
02:58:44,800 --> 02:58:48,440

2508
02:58:49,320 --> 02:58:57,160
Get deployed in handshake. Yeah, good cover fire. Yeah, it's fucking shit. I never got one kill

2509
02:58:57,800 --> 02:58:59,800
You never go one kill

2510
02:59:19,240 --> 02:59:21,240

Time to fuck. How are you all lined up?

2515
02:59:39,280 --> 02:59:45,040
And this is why the spitfire is the best gun in the game because you can actually get kills without having to swap constantly

2516
02:59:48,680 --> 02:59:55,480
Actually, maybe we will play Call of Duty 6 together. I'm not I'm not gonna lie. I think I'd actually really enjoy that

03:27:35,760 --> 03:27:43,640
Where I have tears dripping down my face right now, I can't remember if BT's with me or not, but he jumped in the corner

2753
03:27:47,560 --> 03:27:49,560
Holy shit, we just destroyed that plan

2754
03:27:50,400 --> 03:27:52,400
And

2755
03:27:54,440 --> 03:27:56,880
BT you caused a lot of discharge I can't remember

2756
03:28:10,480 --> 03:28:15,800
Is this not like where they give you a little wink or something like at the industry where it flashes of it

2757
03:28:19,560 --> 03:28:22,160
Destruction of typhoon save the planet harmony

2758
03:28:23,320 --> 03:28:25,320
Militia calls this planet their headquarters

2759
03:28:26,160 --> 03:28:30,200
millions of others call it home waiting for B. E. Pope open the corner like

2760
03:28:32,200 --> 03:28:34,400
I genuinely can't remember the end

2761
03:28:38,760 --> 03:28:41,880
I don't know what that'll feel like to get a sign a new type

2762
03:28:43,440 --> 03:28:45,440
Kind of like the old one

2763
03:28:46,440 --> 03:28:51,040
This is pilot Jack Cooper signing off

2764
03:28:55,440 --> 03:28:57,440
Hmm

2765
03:28:59,240 --> 03:29:01,880
Did they actually kill fucking BT

2766
03:29:12,640 --> 03:29:14,640
Is that what we look like

2767
03:29:15,600 --> 03:29:17,600
I

2768
03:29:17,920 --> 03:29:19,920
Watch the credit

2769
03:29:29,240 --> 03:29:32,240
That's what you look like underneath the helmet reflin

2770
03:29:32,240 --> 03:29:34,240
I

2771
03:29:42,120 --> 03:29:45,600
Say thanks to the dev team, but I'm a bit distraught right now

2772
03:29:52,360 --> 03:29:59,720
There's no way they killed BT after that like there's actually nearly because why would you do that?

2773
03:30:03,240 --> 03:30:06,600
I must start writing emails to the CEO

2774
03:30:11,960 --> 03:30:19,520
Okay, but props to the dev team for putting like a congratulations like you finished the mission type thing but

2775
03:30:21,920 --> 03:30:23,920
Does it actually feel like it

2776
03:30:33,240 --> 03:30:35,240
And yeah about Titanfall 3

2777
03:30:43,240 --> 03:30:45,600
They be healing you a hero though

2778
03:30:53,360 --> 03:30:55,360
It is McCree

2779
03:31:02,240 --> 03:31:04,240
Who voices BT

2780
03:31:08,000 --> 03:31:10,000
Glen Stein beum

2781
03:31:22,880 --> 03:31:25,640
So German name or Stein bomb

2782
03:31:33,240 --> 03:31:36,680
Soldier 76. Oh really?

2783
03:31:47,320 --> 03:31:49,600
Weirdly the guys only voice just been to you

2784
03:31:53,080 --> 03:31:59,360
Sometimes the development team accidentally become the voice actors it's um it's happened before

2785
03:32:00,360 --> 03:32:02,360
It'll happen again

2786
03:32:11,360 --> 03:32:12,760
And

2787
03:32:12,760 --> 03:32:16,880
I'm like 99% sure that's who Anna is from overwatch

2788
03:32:17,800 --> 03:32:23,040
They were the person responsible for hiring was looking for

2789
03:32:24,040 --> 03:32:31,560
Aim someone to fit Anna's makeup and it happened to be the hiring person for Anna and they were like have it

2790
03:32:31,560 --> 03:32:33,560
We just use you

2791
03:32:35,400 --> 03:32:38,240
Although it could be wrong, but I'm like 99% sure

2792
03:32:44,240 --> 03:32:47,040
Yeah, Donkey Kong's VA is one of the deaths from rare. Yeah

2793
03:32:49,200 --> 03:32:51,200
Daddy favorite

2794
03:32:53,280 --> 03:33:02,040
Yeah, like a lot of background or in general voice lines in that or it can be done by the dev teams

2795
03:33:02,040 --> 03:33:04,040
Cuz obviously it's quite an exciting opportunity

2796
03:33:04,040 --> 03:33:09,960
Imagine like being like Jared Bell from like hey, can you scream in a mic for like death sounds in the background? Sure?

2797
03:33:15,520 --> 03:33:18,960
Most of the voice cast and Hades as members of the team. Yeah. Yeah

2798
03:33:19,720 --> 03:33:26,080
Yuri and my agency

2799
03:33:32,160 --> 03:33:38,660
What a cool name Matthew will fuck sake couldn't get a cooler name than that. Could you I wish your name mr. Wolf

2800
03:33:42,080 --> 03:33:45,720
It's spider-man. Oh was it did I miss it Peter Parker?

2801
03:33:48,960 --> 03:33:50,960
I

2802
03:34:11,360 --> 03:34:13,920
Imagine getting asked the morning grunt to finalize the pro

2803
03:34:13,920 --> 03:34:18,320
I mean you need death sounds you need like that. Oh, I'm under fire cover fire

2804
03:34:23,960 --> 03:34:30,200
Strongly we need five more hours and what I mean hurt sound effects. I think I said that I listened to a panel

2805
03:34:30,920 --> 03:34:34,080
of voice actors in a game and someone asked they were like

2806
03:34:34,080 --> 03:34:36,080
how do you differentiate between a

2807
03:34:36,320 --> 03:34:41,440
Victual moon and like being in pain and the voice actors was literally like you can't

2808
03:34:41,680 --> 03:34:45,000
Because it depends on how you take it when you hear it and

2809
03:34:47,160 --> 03:34:49,800
Type thing it's not really

2810
03:34:50,400 --> 03:34:53,600
You know the diff you can always take it out of context

2811
03:34:53,600 --> 03:34:57,400
You know what I mean like you know make a sound because I could pretend to get stabbed and I'll be ah

2812
03:34:58,600 --> 03:35:01,160
But like, you know you could take it

2813
03:35:02,520 --> 03:35:06,520
The other way instead if I do that, you know, it depends how you

2814
03:35:07,520 --> 03:35:12,520
I'm accidentally just walking the context is the main thing that differentiates that mmm

2815
03:35:14,600 --> 03:35:19,980
And they get the good stuff getting stabbed and I'm sure about that

2816
03:35:21,560 --> 03:35:23,560
The human mind is a beautiful thing

2817
03:35:24,920 --> 03:35:27,600
So much stronger for so much content

2818
03:35:29,240 --> 03:35:31,240
How do you take it mummy?

2819
03:35:36,840 --> 03:35:38,840
Hmm

2820
03:35:46,960 --> 03:35:52,280
Why couldn't it be both them well if you hired for a job to make hurt sound effects

2821
03:35:53,800 --> 03:35:55,800
Then I

2822
03:35:55,800 --> 03:35:58,340
Don't think they're gonna want it to sound a bit too

2823
03:36:00,880 --> 03:36:02,880
That pop she doesn't take she give

2824
03:36:03,640 --> 03:36:05,640
If I want to take

2825
03:36:05,920 --> 03:36:07,920
I take

2826
03:36:08,160 --> 03:36:10,160
If I want to move

2827
03:36:10,800 --> 03:36:12,800
If I want you to die

2828
03:36:13,560 --> 03:36:15,560
you die

2829
03:36:18,600 --> 03:36:20,600
That's an assassin's green brotherhood quote

2830
03:36:22,480 --> 03:36:24,480
Sounds a bit too posh for me

2831
03:36:26,440 --> 03:36:33,240
What cute song for a dramatic ending yeah, the internet has been placing grunts of pain zones for the R34 yeah

2832
03:36:34,000 --> 03:36:40,880
Can he deny that I've watched my fair share overwatch and I'm like, huh, that's a literally in-game son

2833
03:36:42,120 --> 03:36:44,900
Mortal Kombat has good pain zones, but not good enough

2834
03:36:47,440 --> 03:36:50,480
Man, I can't wait to see how the story continues in time for three oh

2835
03:36:51,760 --> 03:36:54,520
How about you do you ever think you send late you getting hurt by mistake?

2836
03:36:57,680 --> 03:37:00,320
I've definitely done more gruntier audios

2837
03:37:01,280 --> 03:37:09,520
Gruntier audios seem to be well received like received better than like more lovey-dovey, I guess

2838
03:37:13,400 --> 03:37:15,400
Ring fit noises for example

2839
03:37:18,560 --> 03:37:23,960
I think the devs don't know their target audience of that's a concern heavy breathing from Sprint and heavy breathing from

2840
03:37:25,400 --> 03:37:28,520
Refland's like the grunting confirmed. Yes, I

2841
03:37:29,320 --> 03:37:38,320
Was them using my alternative Twitter posts to see like what got the most popular in terms of likes to show me a

2842
03:37:39,320 --> 03:37:41,320
preference

2843
03:37:42,320 --> 03:37:45,800
I'll need to check out what the results are cuz I posted it yesterday

2844
03:37:45,800 --> 03:37:48,400
I don't know what's been going on because I've not got Twitter on

2845
03:37:50,440 --> 03:37:52,440
I've got regularly

2846
03:37:58,960 --> 03:38:03,440
Could you have calibrated to my helmet?

2847
03:38:07,160 --> 03:38:11,120
So I don't need to be sad okay, I don't need to be sad

2848
03:38:11,560 --> 03:38:16,720
That's Morse code, but what is remember BT uploaded himself into your helmet and that one mission

2849
03:38:17,960 --> 03:38:19,960
No, I don't remember

2850
03:38:20,680 --> 03:38:22,680
What is it hold on?

2851
03:38:23,360 --> 03:38:27,880
Titan fall to what is the Morse code in helmet?

2852
03:38:29,520 --> 03:38:31,520
I think what should we look up right now?

2853
03:38:32,240 --> 03:38:37,160
It says Jack question mark at the end of the credits you get a short cut scene of Jack's helmet

2854
03:38:37,160 --> 03:38:43,360
Sitting the visor lights up blue and a few short flashes flashes before the visor goes great and the screen fades out

2855
03:38:43,360 --> 03:38:49,760
These flashes however spell the spell this one word message in Morse code Jack question mark

2856
03:38:52,040 --> 03:38:54,040
He's waiting on me I

2857
03:38:54,360 --> 03:38:58,480
Guess cuz he can't see so he just has the Morse code fucking flash bang me

2858
03:38:58,520 --> 03:39:00,520
I

2859
03:39:05,400 --> 03:39:11,440
Just refresh marshmallow someone sent me the lyrics to butterfly. Where's my samurai?

2860
03:39:11,440 --> 03:39:18,720
I've been searching for a man all across Japan just to find to find my samurai

2861
03:39:19,360 --> 03:39:25,600
Someone who is strong, but still a little shy. Yes. I need I need my samurai

2862
03:39:26,600 --> 03:39:28,600
I

2863
03:39:29,680 --> 03:39:37,120
Have you little butterfly green black and blue make the colors in this guy. Oh, that's such a cute song

2864
03:39:38,920 --> 03:39:43,120
Mmm, well, we did it. I didn't expect to blast through the campaign

2865
03:39:43,120 --> 03:39:47,280
I mean, I guess because I knew what sections could have been ignored

2866
03:39:48,000 --> 03:39:50,000
and

2867
03:39:50,520 --> 03:39:52,520
Yeah, cuz

2868
03:39:53,520 --> 03:39:55,720
Because I could

2869
03:40:01,880 --> 03:40:05,760
Because I knew which sections weren't actually having to be fulfilled

2870
03:40:06,760 --> 03:40:10,120
It's more to go to reject BT may be alive out in space at his core

2871
03:40:10,120 --> 03:40:14,280
But it's just a theory a game theory literally. No, don't say that to me

2872
03:40:14,280 --> 03:40:20,840
We fun. I know he's alive in my helmet and I'm gonna upload on it's gonna take us gonna take a hot second to transfer him into a core

2873
03:40:20,840 --> 03:40:22,840
But he's in there. Okay, I

2874
03:40:22,960 --> 03:40:27,960
Want to see if she can do it. I'm a funny bear. I'm a funny bear. Yes. I'm a gummy bear

2875
03:40:28,040 --> 03:40:31,960
I'm a moving smoothing funny oney gummy bear. Wow

2876
03:40:33,000 --> 03:40:35,840
What would a bing bing? Uh-uh, what would a bing bing?

2877
03:40:37,000 --> 03:40:40,800
Six hours of mummae. I guess because I did that membership

2878
03:40:40,800 --> 03:40:46,040
I forgot about that. I'm never done a stream it to him again. That's all I'm saying

2879
03:40:51,560 --> 03:40:53,560
And

2880
03:40:56,800 --> 03:41:02,160
All right, well, we did a marshmallow reading is embers coming on today are

2881
03:41:02,760 --> 03:41:06,480
Sheep's up the sheepsters up. No, she be she be did

2882
03:41:07,240 --> 03:41:10,240
She did a pop-up, but is she doing a stream stream?

2883
03:41:11,600 --> 03:41:13,600
No, she's not there

2884
03:41:14,120 --> 03:41:16,120
What about

2885
03:41:21,120 --> 03:41:23,120
Oh, wait

2886
03:41:24,440 --> 03:41:29,480
She's done a collab with emmy Vivian and soul proud

2887
03:41:33,760 --> 03:41:37,400
I'm no like to say it, but yeah, I'm glad I'm glad

2888
03:41:41,200 --> 03:41:45,680
That's funny that's funny, I know who this girl

2889
03:41:45,680 --> 03:41:54,960
If you know, you know, if you don't know that's perfectly okay, not to know you're not missing out on anything later

2890
03:41:56,600 --> 03:42:00,320
Okay, we were redirected sheepsters in around ten minutes time

2891
03:42:01,520 --> 03:42:06,680
Did you sleep well? I got five hours

2892
03:42:08,800 --> 03:42:10,800
Cheeky five hours. Yeah

2893
03:42:11,560 --> 03:42:13,560
Mm-hmm

2894
03:42:13,880 --> 03:42:15,880
Did you sleep well five hours?

2895
03:42:16,240 --> 03:42:17,760
Should we read then? Yes

2896
03:42:17,760 --> 03:42:22,880
I will redirect at the start of her stream because I don't want to distract from the fact she's doing a collab and

2897
03:42:23,400 --> 03:42:27,240
Like I was watching Mercy's collab yesterday on my dad

2898
03:42:28,000 --> 03:42:30,820
my dad see of my dad and I

2899
03:42:31,360 --> 03:42:38,040
Just look noticed the least up. Yeah, I had to put you down there because it looks I couldn't really have you know

2900
03:42:38,040 --> 03:42:43,440
Like on my face and I didn't want to I thought it was six hours. I went to bed

2901
03:42:43,760 --> 03:42:50,200
So I went to bed at 4 p.m. But I couldn't sleep so I got back up again and leaked my schedule for the month

2902
03:42:50,200 --> 03:42:54,240
Oh, I was like, hmm. What can I do? I'll just leave my schedule. Why not and?

2903
03:43:00,240 --> 03:43:04,080
And then I was like listen to music I listen to my doomer music

2904
03:43:04,080 --> 03:43:09,360
I've been listening to like the blade runner playlist where it's like you can't fix that

2905
03:43:09,800 --> 03:43:16,160
One of the titles of one of them and a lot of dr. Kitty and stuff. I seem to have really sad errors

2906
03:43:16,160 --> 03:43:19,640
I'm not like greeting to myself right now. I just need to be like really moody at night. Um

2907
03:43:24,720 --> 03:43:27,400
Not the worst thing someone's leaked why is the leash

2908
03:43:27,920 --> 03:43:33,200
Reaffling frowning that'd be a big issue. You're not frowning. I think you're just like you don't know what to do next

2909
03:43:34,240 --> 03:43:36,240
As we are

2910
03:43:36,480 --> 03:43:39,880
I'm not listening up. It's illegal illegal. I'm not looking at

2911
03:43:41,640 --> 03:43:43,640
And

2912
03:43:45,720 --> 03:43:49,320

My heart may explode from it, but it's purely a happiness and love love you strong a water in my eyes writing that by the way

2956
03:47:51,520 --> 03:47:54,640
All right, I'll need to stop singing that bro. I'll need on the knock off

2957
03:47:55,760 --> 03:47:57,760

03:47:58,640 --> 03:48:00,640
Uh, please don't read this thing

2959
03:48:09,520 --> 03:48:12,720
I have read and understood. Thank you

2960
03:48:27,200 --> 03:48:30,160
Okay, I'm analizing I'm analizing. Okay, I understand

2961
03:48:33,200 --> 03:48:37,600
Oh my god, fellow feature retainful two lover I've already wrapped up. I'm so sorry

2962
03:48:37,840 --> 03:48:44,320
I've already wrapped it up. Shebe's got a vod out though. My gen mate. She'd be caught in bum. She's link in the description below

2963
03:48:45,360 --> 03:48:49,680
Uh, she played it for the first time. So if you want to see it through a new player's eyes

2964
03:48:50,000 --> 03:48:56,400
I definitely recommend her vod my void. I just skipped the parts that I know I can skip because it's the second time

2965
03:48:56,640 --> 03:48:58,640
No, I didn't cry. You can't prove it

2966
03:48:59,600 --> 03:49:03,360
I I didn't cry twice playing this game even though I played it a year ago

2967
03:49:03,760 --> 03:49:07,120
You never said the rating for titanfall

2968
03:49:07,760 --> 03:49:15,760
Um 100 out of 100 because bt is alive if bt genuinely fucking dies it becomes zero

2969
03:49:17,600 --> 03:49:19,600
It becomes zero

2970
03:49:23,600 --> 03:49:28,240
Oh, hold on. It's another one. I'm not supposed to read out loud. There's a lot of things I'm not supposed to read out loud

2971
03:49:34,240 --> 03:49:36,240
I

2972
03:49:48,640 --> 03:49:50,640
I'm sorry for worrying

2973
03:49:52,400 --> 03:49:54,400
It's okay

2974
03:49:54,480 --> 03:49:58,720
Sorry, I'm not very smart. I think that's the problem. I'm not very smart

2975
03:49:59,440 --> 03:50:02,640
I just tried my best. Don't sorry

2976
03:50:04,880 --> 03:50:09,520
I laid laner running for sure. I'm not crying. I got a bug in my a bug

2978
03:50:14,400 --> 03:50:18,720
I didn't like completely forgot all the sections. I forgot that last segment

2979
03:50:19,360 --> 03:50:22,320
I was like, wait, you can't do that to me. What the fuck?

2980
03:50:22,960 --> 03:50:24,960
I've been here since day one

2981
03:50:25,280 --> 03:50:27,280
You can't do this to me

2982
03:50:29,680 --> 03:50:34,000
I hate someone replied to the twitter post. You got four days off in a month

2983
03:50:34,080 --> 03:50:37,680
No, I had to censor what I'm doing on that day because it's gonna leak some stuff

2984
03:50:40,640 --> 03:50:42,640
No, that's funny

2985
03:50:43,200 --> 03:50:45,040
Um

2986
03:50:45,040 --> 03:50:48,560
That's funny. Yes, there's a left or dead stream snipe comment

2987
03:50:49,680 --> 03:50:51,680
I'm coming up

2988
03:50:52,080 --> 03:50:54,080
You gonna let me

2989
03:50:55,840 --> 03:50:57,680
Um

2990
03:50:57,840 --> 03:50:59,840
Yeah

2991
03:51:00,160 --> 03:51:02,160
Who's cutting onions? I'm not crying you are

2992
03:51:02,400 --> 03:51:05,440
Oh gee modern warfare to play through ghost death only

2993
03:51:06,240 --> 03:51:09,200
I was thinking about doing overwatch to

2994
03:51:10,000 --> 03:51:16,560
It overwatched to modern warfare to um campaign at some point. I'd probably spread it out a bit because we've been

2995
03:51:18,240 --> 03:51:21,040
Um very rooty mc2e shooty

2996
03:51:22,000 --> 03:51:24,000
babooty, um

2997
03:51:24,400 --> 03:51:30,480
And I'm trying to get like a good mix of stuff, but I don't know if I'm managing to do it

2998
03:51:31,040 --> 03:51:34,560
I'm like trying to make it so it's not like the same category every single day

2999
03:51:34,880 --> 03:51:40,160
I'm trying to like, you know, we do a bit of blast from the past. We do a bit of the future. We do a bit of theme

3000
03:51:44,480 --> 03:51:48,960
Thank you for all the effort and hard work you put into stream everything about you make me happy. You're a blessing

3001
03:51:49,680 --> 03:51:51,680
I'm a blessing on your life

3002
03:51:52,640 --> 03:51:54,640
Oh

3003
03:51:57,600 --> 03:52:00,480
That goes like this the fourth the fifth

3004
03:52:04,880 --> 03:52:06,400
Um

3005
03:52:06,400 --> 03:52:08,800
I think what else are we doing this week?

3006
03:52:08,880 --> 03:52:14,640
We're doing pikmin and then ismar and then we're doing we're watching an anime. I'm proving that I'm a weeb. We're watching vivi

3007
03:52:15,280 --> 03:52:17,280
fluoride ice

3008
03:52:17,600 --> 03:52:22,560
Wait isn't fluoride what's in toothpaste? Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute vivi flu

3009
03:52:23,200 --> 03:52:28,320
Fluoride ice song. What a name. What does it even mean? No one's got a clue

3010
03:52:28,880 --> 03:52:33,600
I've got castle crashers collab. I've got ring fit and shit. Okay, and then elden ring stream snipe

3011
03:52:33,600 --> 03:52:35,600
So it's just pure stream snipe

3012
03:52:35,600 --> 03:52:41,680
Uh, I've got three days of elden ring in a row so I can technically leak like tomorrow the day after the week

3013
03:52:42,400 --> 03:52:44,240
um

3014
03:52:44,240 --> 03:52:46,240
but yeah

3015
03:52:47,520 --> 03:52:49,520
It's also in the fresh water supply

3016
03:52:50,720 --> 03:52:56,560
Mommy you better ready the tissues though. No, don't make me put my guard up because we'll have another edith finch moment

3017
03:52:57,360 --> 03:53:01,760
Uh, I played edith finch. It was like this game. It was like a two-hour story game

3018
03:53:01,760 --> 03:53:04,160
It was just kind of like a walk simulator story time thing

3019
03:53:05,120 --> 03:53:07,840
And I got warned that it was really sad

3020
03:53:08,240 --> 03:53:13,120
And because it was because I got warned my like guard was up the entire time

3021
03:53:13,760 --> 03:53:15,760
And I was like, yeah

3022
03:53:15,920 --> 03:53:21,520
So don't warn me about it. Don't give me a warning. Let me go and blind. Okay. Let me go and blind

3023
03:53:22,640 --> 03:53:24,640
um

3024
03:53:25,040 --> 03:53:28,880
Let me have no clue what's going on. We'll find out on that day how I feel

3025
03:53:30,400 --> 03:53:35,040
Um, yeah, I would say it's actually rather tame this week. I'd say

3026
03:53:36,240 --> 03:53:38,240
the weeb watch along

3027
03:53:38,800 --> 03:53:40,800
is probably

3028
03:53:41,760 --> 03:53:43,760
Is it bad to say that I'm like

3029
03:53:44,480 --> 03:53:49,840
It would be my like not prepared stream. Obviously. I'm really biased because I get to play elden ring with you

3030
03:53:50,640 --> 03:53:55,120
Like any game I get to play with you. I'm like stream is 10 out of 10. I don't care

3031
03:53:56,800 --> 03:54:01,200
Um, uh, let me not be clear. Let me not be transparent

3032
03:54:02,080 --> 03:54:07,040
Game to try is before your eyes. We're just going to send you only heartbreaking enemies. You better not

3033
03:54:07,520 --> 03:54:09,520
so mommy like surprises

3034
03:54:09,840 --> 03:54:13,840
Say nothing at all even saying something is a spoiler is a spoiler

3035
03:54:14,720 --> 03:54:17,440
How about the dragon cancer game? What does that mean?

3036
03:54:19,920 --> 03:54:21,920
Skyrim

3037
03:54:24,640 --> 03:54:26,640
Dragon can't skyrim

3038
03:54:27,920 --> 03:54:29,920
Skyrim's good

3039
03:54:30,640 --> 03:54:32,640
She be gone live. Okay

3040
03:54:33,280 --> 03:54:35,280

3041
03:54:35,280 --> 03:54:38,000
Plop plop plop get love get love get love. No, you get love

03:54:48,560 --> 03:54:52,000
You're an edge runner watch along. I don't think my heart can take that

3045
03:54:53,040 --> 03:54:56,480
Dragon cancer is sick hero. I think

3046
03:54:57,600 --> 03:55:00,160
A dragon cancer is an actual game name. Oh

3047
03:55:02,560 --> 03:55:06,640
Do no don't let her play that dragon cancel edge on air

3048
03:55:08,880 --> 03:55:12,320
Yeah, where's the poll on twitter? I can't find either. There's no poll on twitter

3049
03:55:13,120 --> 03:55:16,560
You should try death road to canada. It's a fun little game

3050
03:55:19,120 --> 03:55:21,120
Uh

3051
03:55:21,760 --> 03:55:27,280
Right we're i'm not gonna stall because I don't want to redirect in the middle of she v's um play in the game

3052
03:55:28,240 --> 03:55:32,160
So, uh, it's actually been short. I thought we were gonna get a good five hours

3053
03:55:32,160 --> 03:55:37,920
But I'm afraid I may have girl bossed a little too hard. Um, I love you lots

3054
03:55:38,000 --> 03:55:44,400
I'm sorry. It was a bit shorter today than I anticipated tomorrow's Pikmin. I have no idea how long it's going to take me to go through

3055
03:55:44,960 --> 03:55:46,480
um, I

3056
03:55:46,480 --> 03:55:52,160
Played it in the hospital as a child. Um, and I don't remember anything

3057
03:55:53,280 --> 03:55:55,760
Of it. I never finished it. Okay

3058
03:55:56,480 --> 03:55:59,920
right, I'm a redirect into sheberton, um, and

3059
03:56:00,480 --> 03:56:02,960
Then I will

03:56:04,960 --> 03:56:06,960

3067
03:56:33,360 --> 03:56:35,680
Oh, hold on a minute. Hold on a minute

How many kisses how many missions are there and how many loadouts are there in this game?

3069
03:56:40,960 --> 03:56:44,080
I think there's like eight loadouts. So you get eight kisses one

3070
03:56:45,520 --> 03:56:46,640
three

3071
03:56:46,640 --> 03:56:47,680
one

3072
03:56:47,680 --> 03:56:48,800
five

3073
03:56:48,800 --> 03:56:49,600
Next

3074
03:56:49,680 --> 03:56:55,360
My name eight eight loadouts. I think how many deaths zero obviously

3075
03:56:56,720 --> 03:57:02,960
I actually don't know how many times I died to gravity, but it was all gravity literally gravity was my biggest issue

3076
03:57:05,280 --> 03:57:08,640
Right, please enjoy shebie and emmy and vivian and so

3077
03:57:11,520 --> 03:57:16,800
And I'll talk to you goofy goobers tomorrow for some Pikmin and you're gonna have to carry me through because I have no

3078
03:57:16,800 --> 03:57:18,800
clue what's about to happen. Okay
