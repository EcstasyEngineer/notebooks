0	9000	Wow, there we go.
9000	15000	Fall into your hand, I commend your spirit.
15000	18000	Oh, my God.
18000	20000	Testing, testing.
20000	25000	Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis.
25000	31000	I know it's kind of hard just to get off one, two, three.
31000	33000	He asked for a thirteen, yeah?
33000	37000	He drew a thirty-one, so he's trying to hard.
37000	42000	Good morning, good evening, good after.
42000	44000	Below the name.
44000	45000	Okay?
45000	49000	I am none other than Shony Culls and I am playing...
49000	52000	It took me a really long time to be able to screen capture
52000	55000	my legitimate Game Boy Advance that I own.
55000	57000	Oh, it's fantastic.
57000	60000	Really, really fantastic technology.
60000	63000	May or may not, I have just softlocked my PC
63000	67000	and that is why I had such trouble getting on fucking line.
67000	71000	But lo and behold, we are here.
71000	74000	I'm just gonna make sure...
74000	75000	Oh.
75000	77000	Okay, so this...
77000	79000	This thing.
79000	81000	Okay, we're good.
81000	82000	This thing.
86000	87000	Oh my god, oh my god.
87000	89000	I should become an opera singer.
89000	91000	I'm that bloody good.
91000	92000	What's that?
92000	94000	I have smoke up my ass.
94000	96000	Okay, my little reeflings.
96000	99000	Today on the agendination.
99000	100000	Are you doing okay?
100000	104000	Yes, I'm farting up a storm, so alcohol definitely makes you fart more,
104000	106000	if you want to know.
106000	108000	Um...
108000	110000	Uh, what's my sentence?
110000	113000	Um, in four hours time,
113000	115000	we're gonna do a membership stream,
115000	117000	which isn't actually up right now.
117000	119000	Cause...
119000	123000	I maybe didn't put it up yet.
123000	124000	Me?
124000	126000	I've been able to get something up?
126000	129000	Impossible, impossible.
129000	132000	Um...
132000	134000	Wait, what's our name in Zelda gonna be then?
134000	135000	Oh, sorry.
135000	137000	The legend of long.
137000	138000	Wait.
138000	140000	Was it AB?
140000	141000	Uh, right.
141000	142000	Ah.
145000	148000	Oh wait, the in-game character is gonna call us Anon.
148000	150000	No, call us Link.
150000	151000	Link.
151000	153000	We came to town.
153000	155000	We came to save.
156000	159000	Uh, yes, we are doing the forbidden tier list ring.
159000	163000	I am gonna need a kind reefling to send me the Link
163000	166000	and marshmallow, cause I actually don't even have the Link.
166000	168000	Uh, cartoffel of doom.
168000	170000	Thank you very much for coming to member.
170000	173000	Yeah, everyone's need to go and show the number.
173000	174000	Oh!
174000	176000	Why would you never?
176000	177000	Save file.
177000	181000	Do not touch the completely legitimate Nintendo.
181000	183000	Wow.
183000	185000	Damn plane.
185000	187000	The controls are a bit wrong, but...
187000	188000	Wah, I'll read it.
188000	189000	Don't worry if you can't read.
189000	191000	I'll read it for you.
191000	194000	A long, long time ago.
196000	200000	When the world was on the verge of being swallowed by shadow.
205000	212000	A tiny picori appeared from the sky, bringing the hero of men a sword and a golden light.
212000	216000	With wisdom and courage, the hero drove out the darkness.
222000	227000	When peace had been restored, the people enshrined that blade with care.
235000	237000	You've never played Minish Cap?
237000	241000	The funny thing is, Minish Cap is the only Zelda game I've actually played.
244000	246000	Look, it's Zelda!
246000	248000	This is what the entire series is named after.
248000	251000	This little pink pixel here.
251000	255000	The entire series is named after her.
255000	257000	Because everyone...
257000	261000	Ah, made the mistake of thinking that Link is called Zelda as well.
261000	263000	Good morning, meh.
263000	266000	Good morning, meh, meh.
266000	269000	Good morning, Princess Zelda.
269000	272000	Did you sneak out of the castle and come all this way alone?
272000	275000	The moon is so sure to be worried about you.
275000	277000	You know how he gets.
277000	281000	Oh, don't worry about him. He'll be fine. Where's Link?
281000	287000	The whole town is bustling for an annual picori festival.
287000	290000	I thought he and I might go together.
290000	293000	Would you mind? Terribly.
294000	296000	Oh, is that what you're here for?
296000	300000	Well, Link was up late helping me last night and he's still asleep.
300000	303000	But I don't have an errand at the castle.
303000	306000	Yes. Oh, but I do have an errand at the castle.
306000	308000	Yes, that should be fine.
308000	310000	Ah, yes, Legend of Zelda.
310000	313000	Kinks of Weakening, Ike, Void Sword...
313000	315000	Void Sword, sure.
315000	317000	Thank you for the tip. I don't think I was going with Void Sword.
317000	319000	But yes, that should be fine, yes.
319000	323000	Link! Time to get up!
326000	329000	Did I see Nintendo Direct today? No.
329000	332000	Link! Link, I said it's time to get up!
334000	336000	Eh?
336000	338000	Man, I was fapping.
338000	340000	Goddamn, got that morning wooden shit.
341000	343000	I just love these pixel games.
343000	352000	Oh my god, did you know in the VTuber community, someone is making a Legend of Zelda inspired like little fucking Cedar game?
352000	356000	Like, you're at a cafe and shit? I'm gonna be all over that stuff.
356000	358000	Hold on, funding it right now.
359000	360000	Huh?
361000	364000	Oh shit, my freaking tea.
364000	366000	Hey, Link!
366000	371000	Princess, then it lies how I should like to know if you'd like to join her at the festival.
371000	375000	Yeah Link, come on, let's go check out the festival together.
375000	379000	Master Sith already gave me permission to take you.
379000	382000	Well, handed off like a dog.
382000	387000	Yes, after all, the festival only comes once a year. God, have fun.
387000	390000	And while you're there, you can do me a favor.
390000	395000	I just finished making the sword for the minister at Hyrule Castle.
395000	398000	I'd like you to deliver it to him.
401000	405000	You, you accepted the sword.
405000	409000	Make sure you don't lose this extremely important delivery. I won't.
409000	414000	This is the blade that will be presented to the winner of the competition.
414000	419000	Don't lose it. And while the two of you may be childhood friends, remember...
419000	420000	Are you?
420000	423000	Remember, Zelda is the princess of Hyrule.
423000	427000	You watch over her, don't let anything bad happen to her.
427000	432000	Master Smith, quit worrying. I'll be perfectly safe.
432000	436000	Come on, Link, let's go. Check out the festival.
436000	439000	Hold on, let me take a little flip.
440000	442000	Friends owned. Are you joking me?
442000	445000	Do you remember that meme that went really viral?
445000	448000	And it was like, a knight. It was like a princess and a knight
448000	451000	and the princess was getting like booed by the crowd or something.
451000	454000	Now sell it. You can't sell a sword.
454000	457000	Oh, you called me a sell sword, exactly. I got you. 4k.
457000	461000	Check out the festival under her skirt.
461000	464000	Rifle ends. You're feeling it the day you knocked in Ellie's.
464000	468000	Now, if I'm not mistaken, if you're a snowberry,
468000	471000	there should be a membership ASMR going on right now.
471000	473000	Question mark. I have no idea.
473000	476000	I think that's from Aces schedule.
478000	481000	Mercy's off the day. I'm trying to use my autism.
481000	484000	Azura is also off today.
484000	487000	Emmy and Sheebie is on.
487000	491000	Sheebie has a collab and Emmy has a collab
491000	495000	and a day's time with people not in real life.
495000	499000	Thank you, question mark. I can't remember what they're playing today.
499000	502000	That's right. She had to reschedule.
502000	505000	She pushed it to tomorrow. It's delayed.
505000	508000	Oh, probably Aces' call. Alright, okay.
508000	512000	Je comprends, je comprends. Right, let me try and host this honey tea down.
512000	515000	Next week, we're going to write the honey tea plot together,
515000	518000	so I see exactly what you want me to say and I was so fucking excited.
519000	522000	Wow, listen to that music.
522000	525000	This is a Game Boy Advance game.
525000	530000	Oh, listen to that harp, that harmonious.
530000	532000	Wow.
532000	534000	It's so good.
534000	536000	I saw it.
538000	544000	I was going to actually consider making the songs for Jin to be still for this game.
544000	546000	I don't know.
546000	551000	The rules are, if there's any more background music that gets produced,
551000	554000	it has to be a childhood game or a game that I really like.
554000	559000	But Zelda is very peaceful, but I'm not actually sure we have any peaceful concept.
559000	561000	And Jin too.
561000	564000	So far, I don't think anyone is peaceful.
564000	567000	I don't think we have one peaceful person at all.
567000	570000	Azura. Azura is peaceful. She's peaceful.
571000	574000	This would do Azura with a harp.
574000	577000	I maybe should have gone with a harp.
577000	580000	I would be real. I don't even remember all from yesterday.
580000	584000	Turns out chugging a ball. Oh my God, you did not have a football ball.
585000	588000	Strony, what's your opinion on the new Zelda game?
588000	590000	Whatever your opinion is, because I've never played it.
590000	594000	This is the only Legend of Zelda game I have ever had access to and played.
594000	599000	What about Earthbound? I don't know what Earthbound is.
599000	604000	I'm sorry, I'm just getting used to the controls on my...
604000	606000	I'm not going to open this chest because it's got money in it,
606000	609000	and I don't want to waste that opportunity to have that money.
609000	612000	But look how freaking adorable this pixel art is.
612000	615000	Is this not freaking precious?
615000	618000	I'm going to give it to the princess like this.
618000	620000	Yeah, you take that.
620000	622000	Wait, can I do it over the bed?
622000	625000	Hold on. Oh my God, there's two beds for me in the print.
625000	628000	Yeah, you like that. Oh look, I'm making my bed.
628000	631000	Oh look, I need to get all the sheets all smoothed out.
631000	633000	I don't want any creases.
633000	635000	Oh yeah, you like that princess.
635000	638000	I need to practice and I need to get my practice in
638000	640000	for what happens after the festival.
640000	642000	Yeah, teach you that better lesson.
642000	644000	Yo, is that the master sword?
644000	647000	Earthbound is a game...
647000	649000	is a game Ness is from.
649000	652000	Might have seen it in Smash Bros. It's an old Nintendo game.
652000	654000	Oh, come with us.
654000	656000	Making the views.
656000	658000	Link, over here.
658000	660000	Oh, sorry, sorry, Zelda was just pumping.
660000	662000	Sorry, I was just having a cheeky pump.
662000	664000	Right, how's the roll button? Oh, there it is.
664000	667000	Link, hurry, let's go.
667000	670000	You moan in like every sentence.
670000	672000	Is that how you normally talk?
672000	674000	Over here. Come on, hurry up.
674000	676000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
676000	677000	Princess, what's going on here?
677000	679000	Well, here we are.
679000	681000	I'm trying to play.
681000	684000	Princess, princess, it's first thing in the morning, hen.
684000	686000	Wah!
693000	696000	Here we are, Link. Doesn't this look fun?
696000	699000	Come on, let's look around.
699000	702000	Wow, look all the free colors.
702000	705000	I'm getting stimulated.
705000	708000	Welcome to the PCORI Festival.
708000	712000	They say that every 100 years, the PCORI comma high rule.
712000	714000	And this is the 100th year to the day
714000	717000	since the last time the PCORI were here.
719000	722000	Wah, hello, princess.
722000	724000	Link, here's the storyteller here.
724000	727000	We should stop and listen to...
727000	729000	I wonder what's over there.
729000	732000	Jeez, you got ADHD, princess.
732000	734000	You don't need a little stimulant.
734000	735000	I can stimulate you.
735000	737000	So the PCORI are real.
737000	739000	My father always told me they were.
739000	741000	Oh, look at that.
741000	742000	I know.
742000	744000	As long as she's happy, that's the main thing.
744000	746000	Hey, wasn't there going to be
746000	749000	a sword fighting tournament at the castle?
749000	751000	I wonder who won this year.
751000	753000	Oh, wow, over here.
755000	757000	Oh, it is this.
757000	759000	Oh, pardon me.
760000	763000	We have a winner.
763000	764000	Oh my.
764000	766000	Oh my, Princess Zelda.
766000	769000	You won the grand prize in her drawing.
769000	772000	Wow, that's totally not rigged against everyone.
772000	776000	You get your choice of any of these wonderful prizes.
776000	778000	What will it be?
778000	782000	First, we have this lovely heart-shaped stone.
782000	784000	Next, we have...
784000	787000	This magnificent gem.
787000	792000	And finally, there's this tiny shield.
792000	795000	So which one will you like?
795000	796000	Let me guess.
796000	797000	The jewel?
797000	800000	Oh, but this heart-stone is very cute, too.
800000	803000	Choose whichever one you like.
803000	805000	This shield is so adorable.
805000	806000	I heard that.
806000	808000	She likes a small tiny.
808000	810000	I think I'll take it.
813000	815000	Following Strony around the convention
815000	817000	late to the school arts alley.
817000	818000	What?
818000	820000	I'm looking for Rebecca art.
820000	821000	What? Why?
821000	823000	Why would you want that ugly thing?
823000	825000	What about the heart-stone?
825000	826000	It's cute.
826000	829000	Oh, or this giant gem. It's pretty.
829000	831000	Honestly, they're both much nicer
831000	833000	than that nasty little shield thing.
833000	834000	Jeez.
834000	837000	Can I put this in a script?
837000	839000	Nope, I want the shield.
839000	841000	Can I have it?
841000	843000	What a strange princess you are.
843000	844000	Well, okay.
844000	847000	Here's your teeny tiny shield.
851000	853000	Here, I want to give you a present.
853000	856000	It'll match the size of your...
856000	858000	Doesn't the shield suit you perfectly?
858000	859000	Like...
862000	864000	Give you a small shield.
864000	866000	Hold the button to protect yourself.
866000	868000	It is a little embarrassing though.
868000	869000	It's so tiny.
869000	872000	What the heck is going on here?
874000	876000	Oh, he's stutting on him.
876000	878000	Yep, just as I thought.
878000	879000	You look great.
879000	880000	Now, if anything happens,
880000	882000	you can protect me with that shield.
882000	884000	Oh, I almost forgot.
884000	887000	We have to take Master Smith's sword to the castle.
887000	888000	Let's go, Link.
888000	890000	How do I do this?
890000	891000	What?
893000	895000	I will protect you, my lady.
895000	897000	My lady, come, come, my lady.
897000	898000	You must sugar fly.
898000	899000	My bunny, my heady.
899000	900000	That's not the words.
900000	901000	Oh, what the fuck?
901000	902000	Sorry.
905000	908000	This game explains your first outing on Patreon.
908000	909000	Come on, Link.
909000	911000	Let's hurry to the castle.
912000	914000	Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa.
916000	917000	Bonk.
917000	918000	Oh!
918000	919000	Hey!
919000	920000	Ouch!
921000	924000	Not to be the business scrub...
924000	925000	Business scrub.
925000	926000	That's me.
926000	928000	Business scrub.
928000	929000	Wait, that is the same.
929000	931000	It must be the business scrub.
931000	934000	I heard the soldiers talking about it.
934000	936000	They were just saying a dicky scrub
936000	939000	had been hassled in all the passages by...
939000	941000	Link, do something about it.
941000	943000	Otherwise, we can't get to the castle.
943000	945000	If only we had some way to defend ourselves
945000	947000	against those nuts of his.
947000	948000	Wait, what?
950000	952000	It's too early in the morning.
952000	954000	It's too early.
955000	957000	Please forgive me, sir.
957000	959000	I heard that was a festival
959000	961000	and I came to town helping my...
961000	963000	to hawk my words.
963000	966000	Unfortunately, we scrubs have a tendency
966000	968000	to spit nuts as we speak.
968000	970000	Everyone's got scared and ran away
970000	972000	and no one would buy anything.
972000	974000	This is a terrible place to do business.
974000	976000	I'm going back to my cave.
979000	982000	I actually feel a little sorry for that business scrub.
982000	984000	But that net hurt!
985000	987000	Oh well, he won't be hassling anyone now.
987000	989000	We better hurry to the castle.
990000	992000	Wow.
1001000	1003000	I'm getting Australia overload.
1019000	1021000	That's kind of the part of the plan, you know?
1021000	1023000	You see, we've not executed the plan yet
1023000	1025000	but there's many ways to main break them.
1040000	1042000	I'm sorry, Link, but I'd better go.
1042000	1044000	I have to prepare for the ceremony.
1044000	1046000	I had a good time at the festival.
1046000	1048000	Thanks for coming with me.
1050000	1052000	Since you're here, Link,
1052000	1054000	why didn't you join us for the award ceremony?
1054000	1056000	No point in going home, old chap.
1056000	1058000	Just join us.
1058000	1060000	Why not? You're here anyway.
1060000	1062000	Oh, look, it's me and the boy, Potho.
1064000	1066000	I do know about that sword, Link.
1066000	1068000	It is called the PCORI BLADE
1068000	1070000	and it looks much evil.
1070000	1072000	What?
1072000	1074000	And it locks much evil away in that chest.
1074000	1076000	Sorry, it's a bit early in the morning
1076000	1078000	to be talking about Gothic architecture.
1078000	1081000	The PCORI BLADE is sacred among the people of Hyrule.
1081000	1083000	The legend has it that, long ago,
1083000	1085000	the PCORI gave us this blade.
1085000	1087000	Whoever wins the competition
1087000	1090000	earns the honor of touching the sacred blade.
1090000	1093000	Would you let me touch your sacred blade?
1095000	1097000	Whoa, big daddy in the horse.
1097000	1099000	Fuck's it, he's truly twice the size of his elder.
1102000	1105000	Let the award ceremony commence.
1105000	1108000	Avati, champion of the competition,
1108000	1110000	you may approach the blade.
1112000	1114000	Was that Conqueror's Bad Ferdy?
1114000	1116000	It absolutely was.
1119000	1121000	King Chonk of Hyrule.
1124000	1127000	To think things would go this well,
1127000	1130000	the PCORI BLADE and the bone chests
1130000	1133000	spoken of the Hyrllian Reborn.
1133000	1136000	This chest must hold that which I seek.
1136000	1139000	I relieve you of its contents now.
1150000	1152000	Do not interfere with that.
1152000	1154000	Me?
1154000	1158000	As Victor, I earned this right to approach the PCORI BLADE.
1158000	1161000	I've been waiting for this moment.
1162000	1165000	I don't know why Scottish people are evil, but...
1165000	1168000	Oh wait, maybe they'd be British, like English.
1168000	1170000	I've been waiting for this moment.
1170000	1172000	Okay, okay, sorry.
1177000	1179000	Protecta Zelda?
1179000	1181000	Eh, yeah, no, let's do it.
1183000	1184000	Wait, what's the British voice?
1184000	1185000	Who are you?
1185000	1186000	Why are you doing this?
1186000	1187000	Oh wait, that's Zelda.
1187000	1189000	Who are you? Why are you doing this?
1190000	1193000	The princess with the mystic aura.
1193000	1196000	The power that was gifted to the people of Hyrule
1196000	1201000	still flows within the veins of that lady.
1201000	1204000	The veins of the ladies of its royal family.
1204000	1205000	Interesting.
1205000	1209000	If I leave you now, you will only cause me trouble later.
1209000	1211000	That will never do.
1213000	1215000	To stone with you!
1216000	1217000	Run now!
1217000	1219000	Ah, Zelda now!
1223000	1226000	All who stand in my way shall share this fate.
1226000	1229000	Now to find out what power awaits me in the chest.
1238000	1239000	Ete!
1239000	1243000	There is nothing in there but a rabble of monsters.
1243000	1245000	What's the meaning of this?
1245000	1250000	Well, I know the force and I'm after it's somewhere out there.
1250000	1252000	I'm in no hurry.
1252000	1254000	I can take my time searching for it.
1259000	1261000	Classic British stealing things.
1261000	1262000	Exactly, yes.
1262000	1265000	I thought Star Wars reference too, but I'm probably just...
1265000	1268000	Oh my god, we're in a castello!
1268000	1271000	Oh my god, this is the Borgia Castle, clearly.
1271000	1273000	Wake up, wake up.
1273000	1275000	Put on a little bit of makeup.
1275000	1277000	Oh, we need to make the bed for the maid.
1277000	1278000	Oh, I'm so sorry.
1278000	1279000	Oh, you want to take over?
1279000	1280000	Oh, hold on.
1280000	1283000	Oh shit, I interact with people when you do that.
1284000	1287000	I was gonna hump her, but I interact with people when you do that.
1291000	1292000	Erlink, you're awake.
1292000	1293000	Are you feeling alright?
1293000	1295000	Stand at my side.
1295000	1297000	The king of Hyrule is about to speak.
1298000	1301000	It is as you have all heard.
1301000	1307000	A sorcerer named Vati has cursed my fair Zelda and turned her to stone.
1307000	1312000	If we had the sacred PCORI blade, we likely could have broken the curse.
1312000	1315000	But Vati shattered the blade.
1315000	1318000	However, I have not given up hope.
1318000	1320000	What do you know about the PCORI?
1322000	1325000	Er, the PCORI, not much.
1326000	1327000	Beyond what?
1327000	1329000	Oh fuck, these both have the same voice.
1329000	1335000	Beyond what the fairytales say, they're supposed to be very tiny if I remember correctly.
1336000	1341000	It is the ones from the fairytales, but the PCORI are no mere legend.
1341000	1343000	They are certain exists.
1343000	1347000	No one outside of the royal family knows the truth about them.
1347000	1353000	The PCORI who forged the sacred blade lived deeper than the Minish Wars.
1353000	1359000	They should be able to repair the broken blade and reforge the sword.
1359000	1361000	What?
1361000	1365000	There must be dispatch the soldiers there at once.
1365000	1368000	No, soldiers will not do.
1368000	1372000	The PCORI do not show themselves to anyone but children.
1372000	1378000	Our soldiers could search for days and still fight no cycle.
1379000	1382000	I see.
1382000	1385000	That's the case, then why not send Link?
1385000	1391000	If Link has recovered then yes, I would like to ask him of this.
1391000	1395000	Please, turn my precious Zelda back to normal.
1395000	1400000	The PCORI should know how to create a new sacred sword.
1400000	1406000	It will be a dangerous journey, now that those monsters have been freed.
1406000	1412000	Please, take the sword with you along with the broken PCORI blade.
1416000	1419000	Broken PCORI blade!
1420000	1426000	This is part of the sword needed to be forged with sacred sword. Do not lose it.
1429000	1431000	Smith sword!
1431000	1434000	It's a sharp blade made by your grandfather.
1434000	1435000	Very well then.
1435000	1440000	Very well then. Send the soldiers to search for that in the world.
1444000	1449000	Deep within the Minish Woods you will find the place called Deepwood Shrine.
1449000	1454000	Once, humans and PCORI ship that shrine as a meeting place.
1454000	1459000	I think it would be best if you started your search there.
1460000	1464000	Take this map with you.
1464000	1468000	If you get lost on your way to the forest then please check your map.
1468000	1471000	Just press start and then this stuff.
1471000	1474000	And I've marked it on the location of the forest view.
1474000	1476000	Gluck and be careful.
1477000	1480000	You got the map of Hyrule!
1480000	1482000	Now you'll never get lost.
1483000	1484000	Bottom right.
1484000	1486000	You have to go bottom right, okay?
1486000	1489000	The child will learn to kill. Send the child.
1489000	1492000	The child and yearn for the mines.
1492000	1495000	I am counting on you, Link.
1495000	1498000	Only you can break Barty's curse of free princess.
1500000	1503000	Okay, let's unprofessionally roll out of this castle.
1504000	1507000	I like the game. What's the name of the country?
1510000	1513000	This is based in America? What?
1514000	1516000	The Chales will become a man.
1516000	1517000	Be a man.
1517000	1521000	You must be slipped as the Corsing River.
1521000	1524000	Man, you must just take off that dress.
1524000	1526000	Fire through the mouth.
1526000	1531000	Man, you must just take off that dress.
1531000	1532000	Miss...
1544000	1547000	You're in my way, you're in my way, you're in my way.
1547000	1550000	That's fine. I'll forgive you.
1573000	1581000	Oh, we got coins!
1582000	1586000	You've got one rupee. It's green. Don't spend all in one place.
1586000	1589000	You guys wouldn't spend me all in one place, would you?
1594000	1597000	I've not accidentally left reverb on, have I?
1598000	1600000	One coin, let's go.
1601000	1605000	You guys will have to remind me at the four-hour mark I'm to get off,
1605000	1608000	because we're playing the rest of the game tomorrow.
1608000	1612000	I'm doing the Forbidden Tearless, and I already didn't forget.
1622000	1626000	Yes, I have played this game in childhood a couple of times,
1626000	1629000	so I'm not too terrible.
1629000	1632000	Watch me eat my words in about an hour's time, but...
1632000	1634000	You can't do anything yet.
1634000	1636000	I'm not in one place, but I'm sure you can.
1636000	1638000	You're awesome.
1638000	1640000	Multiple, but multiple, please.
1640000	1643000	I know, I can't believe that I'm not finishing a game in one go.
1643000	1646000	It's absolutely crazy. It's terrible.
1648000	1650000	Help! Help me!
1651000	1652000	Ouch!
1652000	1654000	Want somebody stop him?
1654000	1656000	Ow! Ow! Help! Somebody!
1656000	1658000	Can't anyone hear me?
1658000	1660000	I don't want boys to get these guys.
1664000	1666000	No, it's definitely a guy-hat.
1666000	1668000	There are many hats in the world.
1668000	1670000	But this is a guy-hat.
1674000	1676000	Hey, kid, you there!
1678000	1681000	Hey, don't just stand there, do something!
1682000	1683000	Ow!
1683000	1685000	What's wrong with you?
1685000	1688000	Do you like watching me take this piss?
1688000	1691000	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
1694000	1696000	Well done, that was close.
1696000	1698000	Now that I couldn't handle that myself.
1698000	1700000	But that's beside the point.
1700000	1704000	What in the world is a lone child doing so deep in the woods?
1704000	1706000	I see.
1706000	1710000	The PCORI, you say, in Vati?
1710000	1712000	Vati's curse someone what?
1712000	1714000	The Sacred Blade?
1714000	1716000	Is that so? I see, I see.
1716000	1719000	Okay, you know, you know, I have quite a lot in common.
1719000	1722000	You see, I too am on a quest to break the curse of Vati's.
1723000	1727000	And you say they reforged the Sacred Blade can break...
1727000	1731000	That reforging the Sacred Blade can break his curse, eh?
1731000	1734000	Well, then you have found yourself a companion, my boy.
1734000	1736000	My name's Ezlo.
1736000	1739000	It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
1740000	1742000	Speak.
1742000	1744000	What? Is there something on my face?
1744000	1746000	Quit staring, it's rude.
1746000	1748000	Wait, wait, wait, I said.
1748000	1750000	You walk so quickly, too quick in fact.
1750000	1752000	Can you go any slower?
1752000	1755000	Certainly you've noticed that I have no legs.
1755000	1757000	Boy, take a good look at me.
1757000	1760000	Do you really think I can walk that fast?
1760000	1762000	Eugh!
1762000	1765000	If this isn't one thing, it's another.
1765000	1768000	You're a troublesome boy.
1770000	1773000	There, now you can't possibly leave me behind.
1773000	1775000	My, it's actually quite comfortable up here.
1775000	1777000	More comfortable than it looks, surely?
1777000	1779000	And much easier on me.
1779000	1781000	Hey, quit your squirming, can't you sit still?
1781000	1783000	See, there, there, there you go.
1783000	1784000	Yes, yes, yes.
1784000	1786000	That's it, much better.
1786000	1790000	Now, I suppose a boy like you still has much to learn about the world.
1790000	1793000	If ever you needed my insight, press select.
1793000	1795000	I'll be happy to help.
1795000	1797000	Eh, such a hopeless child.
1798000	1800000	Ta-da!
1800000	1801000	We have hats.
1801000	1802000	Look at the drip.
1802000	1803000	Read the drip.
1803000	1804000	Read it.
1804000	1805000	Read the drip.
1805000	1807000	Is it posing?
1807000	1809000	Is it starting on the floor?
1809000	1810000	Look at the drip.
1810000	1811000	Look at that hat physics.
1811000	1812000	Look at the physics.
1812000	1815000	When I go forward, the hat doesn't sing.
1815000	1817000	Hold on for a moment.
1817000	1819000	My boy will stumble across something important.
1819000	1821000	The world of the Minish is very small
1821000	1823000	and you're far too big to meet them now.
1823000	1824000	Eh?
1824000	1825000	Where's the Minish?
1825000	1826000	Ah, yes, silly me.
1826000	1828000	Allow me to explain.
1828000	1830000	You humans call them Bakori,
1830000	1833000	but they refer to themselves as the Minish.
1833000	1835000	Strange how, in the world of humans,
1835000	1837000	only this forest has kept the name.
1837000	1841000	Anywho, deep in the forest, they built a tiny village.
1841000	1844000	They were many who...
1844000	1846000	Oh, a good woman.
1846000	1847000	Live now.
1847000	1850000	But if they're where to enter the village,
1850000	1853000	we'll have to make you a touch smaller first.
1853000	1855000	Look at that.
1855000	1859000	At first glance, it appears to be a mere stump, yes?
1859000	1860000	No.
1860000	1863000	That stump is the portal used by people long ago
1863000	1865000	to adjust their size.
1865000	1868000	With my help, you can use it to shrink down to Minish size.
1868000	1871000	Just stand at the stump and press this button.
1871000	1874000	To return to normal, stand again and press the button.
1874000	1877000	Get me up there and we'll give it a try.
1879000	1882000	Humana, humana, humana, humana, humana, humana.
1883000	1887000	Oh my god, we're in a tiny...
1887000	1891000	Oh, look, we're doing butt bouncing on the wee mushrooms.
1891000	1893000	Always so pretty cute.
1894000	1897000	Welcome to the world through the eyes of the Minish.
1897000	1899000	Now, aren't you glad you saved me?
1899000	1901000	No need to thank me, though.
1901000	1904000	Portals that reduce your size are all around
1904000	1906000	in different shapes and sizes.
1906000	1908000	If you want to return to normal,
1908000	1910000	stand next to the portal and press N.
1910000	1913000	But there is one thing you must know.
1913000	1917000	Being Minish-sized is full of dangers.
1917000	1921000	With mere puddles at your normal size are bottomless pits.
1921000	1924000	And as your companion, if anything bad happens to you,
1924000	1926000	it happens to me, too.
1926000	1929000	So proceed with caution, my lad.
1929000	1931000	If not for your sake, then for my own,
1931000	1934000	why is the heck is he starting to scandinavian?
1935000	1937000	Anus bibanus?
1937000	1939000	What? Anus bibanus?
1939000	1941000	Thank you for the tip.
1941000	1942000	Wah! Oh, sorry, sorry.
1942000	1944000	Neat timing, neat timing.
1944000	1946000	Wah, wah, wah, wah!
1947000	1949000	Red voice speedrun?
1949000	1950000	Oh.
1950000	1951000	Ah!
1951000	1953000	Nando desu.
1953000	1956000	I was there, I was there.
1957000	1958000	Okay.
1960000	1962000	Look, it's an acorn.
1962000	1964000	Look, it's an acorn.
1964000	1965000	Look, it's a leaf.
1965000	1966000	Look, it's an acorn.
1966000	1968000	Look, it's a leaf.
1968000	1969000	Acorn.
1969000	1971000	And there's clover.
1971000	1973000	Minnish village.
1976000	1977000	Wow.
1977000	1978000	Hmm.
1978000	1981000	It appears we have found the minnish village.
1991000	1993000	We don't understand them yet,
1993000	1995000	so they're just gonna go...
1996000	2000000	I gather it's been quite some time since they last saw a human.
2000000	2001000	What's that?
2001000	2004000	You don't understand what they were saying just now?
2004000	2005000	Ah, yes.
2005000	2007000	That was the language of the minnish.
2007000	2010000	That's a little different from the dialect I'm most familiar with.
2010000	2014000	I'm afraid I didn't catch most of what they said myself.
2015000	2018000	But perhaps there is someone here who understands your language.
2018000	2020000	We should look around.
2020000	2022000	So we need to find the village elder,
2022000	2024000	which he should be up here for now.
2025000	2026000	Oh.
2026000	2028000	You got a heart.
2028000	2030000	They replenish your life a little bit.
2030000	2031000	I never played this.
2031000	2032000	It's so pretty.
2032000	2034000	It's a cute little pixel thing.
2034000	2036000	Good voice acting thing.
2036000	2037000	Fried my voice.
2037000	2038000	Ah, Denpa.
2038000	2040000	I finally recorded my side of the line,
2040000	2041000	so I need to edit it.
2041000	2042000	Soon.
2042000	2044000	Soon I will update you, Denpa.
2044000	2047000	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
2047000	2048000	Pick up the heart here.
2048000	2050000	You got a piece of heart.
2050000	2052000	Select four to make a new heart container
2052000	2054000	for even more life energy.
2056000	2058000	One of the best pixel art games,
2058000	2060000	they put their whole penussy in this.
2060000	2062000	That's what we see.
2065000	2067000	Right, we're now talking to the elder.
2069000	2072000	I've never seen an outfit like that before.
2072000	2074000	Are you a human?
2074000	2076000	Oh my, it's been some quite some time
2076000	2078000	since any human has come here.
2078000	2080000	My name is Faustari.
2080000	2083000	I watch the abbey as well as the shrine in the north.
2083000	2086000	You seem to be having some trouble with our language, aren't you?
2086000	2087000	Yeah.
2087000	2089000	You could use the jabbernut.
2089000	2092000	It will allow you to understand our tongue.
2092000	2095000	You should be able to find one in the barrel else,
2095000	2096000	just selfie.
2096000	2098000	I'll make them cockney.
2098000	2100000	I need to start using the cockney accent
2100000	2103000	because I'm starting to blend all the guys' voices together.
2104000	2106000	I think this is above or below?
2106000	2108000	I think it's below.
2111000	2113000	Oh, no. Don't climb that again.
2117000	2118000	Check.
2119000	2121000	Uh, like, this must be the jabbernut.
2122000	2124000	I don't know what voice I gave him.
2126000	2128000	This must be the jabbernut for Starry, told you about.
2128000	2132000	Well, you'd be better eat it if you plan on making any progress at all.
2132000	2134000	That's what I'm just making, I'm Scottish.
2134000	2137000	You ate the jabbernut, now you can understand the language of the Minnish.
2137000	2141000	I think I'm just going to have to make my hat Scottish
2141000	2143000	because I can't for the life of my mix of these.
2145000	2147000	Make sure it's all the...
2148000	2150000	Wait, what do I need dinner?
2150000	2152000	I can eat, do I go back to the abbey?
2155000	2156000	So you've eaten the jabbernut,
2156000	2158000	is you're eating the jabbernut yet?
2158000	2159000	And now you can understand us.
2159000	2162000	Yeah, sorry, but I know a little bit about the sewers.
2162000	2163000	I'm just the elder.
2163000	2164000	I'm sure the elder can help.
2164000	2166000	Yeah, yeah, head over to the elder.
2166000	2168000	Yeah, you're not my problem anymore.
2168000	2170000	Now you've got the jabbernut inside you.
2171000	2173000	Okay, to the elder.
2174000	2175000	Hello.
2180000	2183000	Bro, I'm out of accents.
2185000	2186000	Well, I'm making French.
2186000	2187000	Oh, you must...
2187000	2189000	You speak our language?
2189000	2193000	It's been quite a while since we've heard of outsiders
2193000	2194000	speak our tongue.
2194000	2196000	We have a little to offer you in these woods.
2196000	2198000	But please enjoy your stay.
2198000	2199000	Thank you for your...
2201000	2202000	Thanks for your offer,
2202000	2204000	but we have no time to relax.
2204000	2206000	My name is Ezlo.
2206000	2207000	This trial is link.
2207000	2209000	We need to break a curse
2209000	2212000	that has been cast on the Princess of Hyrule.
2212000	2215000	To do so, we'll need to reforge the broken PCORI blade.
2216000	2219000	Yes, you have come.
2219000	2222000	You're now hoping to have the blade reforged.
2222000	2223000	I will...
2223000	2225000	If that is what you are after,
2225000	2228000	you need firm mystic elements.
2228000	2229000	We...
2229000	2230000	Wait, wait.
2230000	2233000	These elements are the chrysaline
2233000	2236000	firms of the energies of this world.
2236000	2239000	Only by infusing the blade with these energies
2239000	2240000	can a new blade be forged.
2240000	2241000	Yes, so here.
2241000	2242000	Give me your map.
2242000	2244000	I can mark out where these three elements are.
2244000	2246000	Three elements can be found as three elements.
2246000	2247000	Oh!
2247000	2249000	Oh, these elements, not three.
2249000	2251000	I've not got my glasses on.
2252000	2255000	The earth element can be found in the shrine
2255000	2258000	to the enough of Fastari's army.
2258000	2260000	Speak with the Fastari.
2260000	2263000	He will show you the path to the shrine's entrance.
2263000	2265000	Go without caution.
2265000	2266000	Go with caution.
2266000	2270000	Evil creatures have a little middle home in our shrine.
2270000	2271000	Yes.
2271000	2272000	Wait.
2272000	2274000	Speak to me at once,
2274000	2276000	if you have found the earth element.
2276000	2277000	Okay.
2278000	2279000	As a French, that makes sense.
2279000	2280000	Perfect.
2280000	2281000	Forget it.
2281000	2284000	French people cannot stop themselves from going...
2286000	2287000	That's the only...
2287000	2290000	If you ever want to assimilate as a French person,
2290000	2292000	just go...
2292000	2294000	In between your sentences
2294000	2296000	and instantly you're French.
2296000	2299000	You used to go to the shrine very well this way then.
2302000	2304000	I will be settled in recently.
2304000	2305000	Just be careful.
2305000	2307000	It's a bit dangerous.
2309000	2311000	We need an Aussie accent somewhere.
2311000	2312000	Oh!
2312000	2313000	Oh, sugar.
2313000	2314000	I forgot to pick this up.
2314000	2315000	We'll pick it up.
2315000	2316000	We'll pick it up on the way back.
2316000	2318000	Don't let me forget this.
2321000	2322000	Equals French.
2322000	2325000	You can hug the upper right side of the tower for a heart.
2328000	2329000	Yeah.
2329000	2332000	I was talking about there being monsters inside, didn't I?
2332000	2333000	Hey, now.
2333000	2336000	There's no reason to be afraid of anything.
2336000	2337000	I'll be waiting right here though.
2337000	2338000	No, wait.
2338000	2339000	What am I saying?
2339000	2341000	I'm not letting you leave me alone out here.
2341000	2343000	No, because you're not being myself.
2343000	2344000	Right, I can't...
2344000	2346000	I don't have the sucky pot yet.
2346000	2347000	But there should...
2347000	2348000	There is a heart piece in here.
2350000	2352000	Can you guys see that fine?
2352000	2354000	Does the brightness seem fine?
2354000	2356000	Because I keep mentioning this.
2356000	2357000	My Crash Bandicoot stream.
2357000	2361000	The display was correct for me, but wrong on stream.
2361000	2362000	You've got a small key.
2362000	2364000	Use it to open lock doors and blocks.
2364000	2367000	You can use it only in this dungeon though.
2367000	2368000	It's all good.
2368000	2369000	Good to go.
2369000	2370000	Okay.
2370000	2371000	There's a lock door here.
2371000	2373000	See if you can find the key to...
2376000	2379000	I'm a few steps ahead of you, but it's okay.
2380000	2382000	Maybe just a little bit drop on you.
2382000	2385000	Honestly, I thought that was really creative.
2386000	2387000	Do you see that level?
2387000	2389000	I think you should be able to pull it.
2389000	2392000	Just stand in front of it and press and then grab it.
2392000	2393000	Then use...
2393000	2394000	Pull it.
2396000	2397000	Look at this detail.
2397000	2399000	If you keep pushing, the space turns red.
2399000	2400000	Like, come on.
2400000	2403000	I have to admit, Nintendo cooked a little bit for this one.
2405000	2406000	Mug.
2408000	2409000	Not today.
2411000	2412000	Wait, is this...
2412000	2414000	Yeah, if you want to do a little backtrack and just do that.
2416000	2418000	Well, they'll have a grunk.
2418000	2421000	Right, you cannot hurt these guys yet.
2422000	2425000	Whoa, look at the size of that barrel.
2426000	2428000	Yeah, how silly, but sorry.
2428000	2429000	It's not big, we're just small.
2429000	2430000	Sorry, sorry.
2430000	2432000	Forgot about that perspective and everything.
2432000	2433000	You know what I mean?
2433000	2435000	I mean, you've got to respect him.
2435000	2436000	Sorry about that.
2436000	2438000	You cannot hurt these guys yet,
2438000	2441000	but you have to like push them out of your way, basically.
2441000	2442000	Is there anything up here?
2442000	2443000	No.
2444000	2446000	I love the Game Boy Zelda games.
2446000	2447000	They're fire.
2447000	2449000	What's the other Game Boy Zelda games?
2449000	2450000	I might have to give it a try.
2451000	2453000	So don't mind us.
2453000	2454000	Just scoo...
2454000	2455000	scoozy me.
2456000	2458000	A little bit of scoochy cream.
2458000	2459000	Push it in.
2460000	2461000	That's the budget.
2462000	2463000	Push it real good.
2465000	2467000	So we have now unlocked the barrel,
2467000	2469000	so it can now rotate when we're inside.
2470000	2472000	So all we need to do is...
2472000	2474000	Oh, here, I think.
2474000	2475000	I think.
2477000	2478000	What?
2478000	2479000	Hey, be careful.
2479000	2480000	I'm allowed to barrel just moved.
2480000	2481000	Wait, maybe?
2481000	2482000	Is this one quick?
2482000	2483000	Is it?
2483000	2484000	No, I'm getting rabied.
2485000	2486000	Is this one first?
2486000	2487000	Is this one first?
2491000	2492000	Is it?
2492000	2493000	No.
2493000	2494000	Wait.
2494000	2495000	Ah, it was that one.
2495000	2496000	I knew it was that one.
2496000	2497000	I'm just thinking of you.
2498000	2499000	The link to the path.
2499000	2500000	I played the hiccup.
2500000	2501000	Link's awake.
2501000	2502000	Link's awake.
2502000	2504000	Maybe we should give it a shot.
2504000	2505000	Is it easy?
2505000	2507000	This is supposed to be a kids game,
2507000	2508000	but I have to admit,
2508000	2510000	the boss fight at the end...
2510000	2512000	God, it's three hits now.
2512000	2513000	The boss fight at the end?
2513000	2514000	No bueno.
2517000	2518000	So we just want to do...
2518000	2519000	I see the heart.
2520000	2521000	So we're going to push that out
2521000	2523000	so we have access to what was here.
2524000	2525000	I don't know.
2525000	2526000	No.
2531000	2533000	Ah, don't destroy this paw.
2534000	2535000	What we need now
2535000	2537000	is starting to hold down the switch.
2537000	2538000	Wait, I'm on it.
2538000	2539000	I'm on it.
2539000	2540000	Then you worry.
2541000	2543000	Just don't play Metroid Fusion.
2543000	2544000	10 out of 10.
2544000	2545000	I hate it.
2545000	2546000	What?
2546000	2547000	Oh, 10 out of 10.
2547000	2548000	You hate.
2548000	2549000	Wait, is this a shortcut as well?
2549000	2550000	Yeah.
2550000	2551000	I'm just going to make sure
2551000	2552000	we've unlocked all the way
2552000	2553000	shortcut things along the way,
2553000	2554000	because...
2556000	2558000	Once you take hold of Sotun
2558000	2559000	with mm-mm-mm-mm,
2559000	2560000	you can push a pill
2560000	2562000	that should be extremely important.
2562000	2564000	So I hope you take these pointers.
2564000	2565000	There you go.
2565000	2566000	I will.
2566000	2568000	I'm taking the pointers.
2572000	2573000	There we go.
2573000	2574000	Sorry.
2574000	2575000	I'm having a stroke there.
2575000	2576000	Hold on a minute.
2576000	2577000	Use it to unlock the doors.
2577000	2578000	Absolutely.
2580000	2581000	2D Zelda game
2581000	2583000	didn't really change anything.
2583000	2584000	I already...
2584000	2586000	I pushed that, but it reset.
2590000	2592000	They announced a new 2D Zelda game
2592000	2593000	where you play as Zelda.
2593000	2594000	Okay, wait.
2594000	2595000	Maybe I will have to check out
2595000	2596000	Nintendo Direct,
2596000	2598000	because if it's cute,
2598000	2600000	but it's kawaii-nee,
2600000	2602000	they've got me in a choke hole.
2602000	2604000	I can't believe the stereotype
2604000	2605000	of girls playing games
2605000	2607000	because they're cute is real.
2607000	2609000	You found the dungeon map.
2610000	2612000	Okay, let's go.
2614000	2615000	Now what?
2615000	2616000	Oh, we got...
2616000	2618000	Oh, did I just swap that around?
2621000	2622000	I'll survive.
2624000	2625000	It's Ogre, the new Zelda.
2625000	2627000	Literally, these gender norms have hands.
2628000	2629000	I can't believe it.
2629000	2631000	What do you mean I'm only going to play a game
2631000	2632000	because it's cute?
2632000	2633000	What do you mean that
2633000	2635000	Viva Pina is the most adorable thing
2635000	2637000	and they should remaster it?
2638000	2640000	They're just the perfect little...
2640000	2641000	Open...
2641000	2642000	Open...
2642000	2643000	Cuman.
2645000	2646000	What's the plan?
2646000	2647000	What's up here?
2647000	2648000	Is there something up here?
2648000	2649000	Is there something down there?
2649000	2650000	Is there something for everyone?
2650000	2651000	Right.
2651000	2652000	Will we go that way first?
2653000	2655000	We'll go down first since this...
2657000	2658000	I like how they were like,
2658000	2660000	no, you're not going to lose any health
2660000	2662000	for not being able to judge the...
2663000	2664000	the distance.
2668000	2670000	Nice to see you play a classic.
2670000	2671000	Yeah.
2671000	2673000	I'm like trying to do
2673000	2675000	one childhood game
2675000	2677000	so I can show you guys
2677000	2679000	like how I'm cultured.
2681000	2682000	Oh!
2682000	2684000	I actually lost some health for once.
2689000	2691000	So you need to move this one out of me.
2694000	2696000	Yes, I'm trying to do at least one
2696000	2698000	childhood game every week.
2698000	2699000	Did I say a month?
2699000	2700000	I think I might have said a month.
2700000	2702000	Every week type thing.
2702000	2703000	This is just exciting.
2704000	2705000	You...
2705000	2707000	The one thing I like about this game
2707000	2708000	is you can spam the sword
2708000	2709000	and nothing can hit you
2709000	2711000	because they have to bounce back.
2711000	2712000	It's actually a really good design.
2712000	2713000	I'm sorry.
2713000	2714000	I said it.
2714000	2715000	It's a really good design.
2715000	2716000	Okay, we've got Pina.
2717000	2718000	Any Halo players?
2718000	2719000	Absolutely.
2719000	2721000	So a Halo campaign
2721000	2723000	can be played multiplayer,
2723000	2725000	which I'm interested about
2725000	2728000	possibly grabbing some worlds for.
2728000	2730000	I don't know
2730000	2733000	if I'll need to hunt for each of them.
2733000	2735000	That play Halo or maybe.
2736000	2738000	Azura really surprised me.
2740000	2742000	Oh, there's a heart.
2745000	2747000	I got freaking jumped here.
2749000	2750000	See you, you wee bam.
2750000	2751000	Oh, fuck I missed.
2751000	2752000	Sorry, hold on.
2752000	2754000	See you, you wee bam.
2755000	2756000	There.
2758000	2759000	Right, I'm pretty sure
2759000	2760000	we get this weapon in here.
2760000	2762000	So I want to go in here.
2763000	2765000	It's Black Ops to the childhood game.
2765000	2767000	I'd say Black Ops one hour.
2768000	2769000	Oh my god, maybe.
2770000	2771000	So this wiggly worm,
2771000	2772000	he becomes enraged,
2772000	2774000	but don't worry.
2774000	2776000	You just need a boofy snoop.
2776000	2777000	I just got booped in.
2777000	2778000	Aha, you know that.
2779000	2780000	And you need to hit his butt.
2781000	2782000	Take this.
2782000	2783000	Take his spanking.
2786000	2787000	And he just runs around
2787000	2788000	like a wiggly worm.
2788000	2789000	And he spank his nose.
2790000	2792000	And then you go get his boinkins.
2793000	2794000	Spank that boink.
2797000	2798000	And now
2799000	2801000	we have the gust jar.
2801000	2803000	Hold the button to draw things in
2803000	2805000	and release to fire them out.
2806000	2808000	Set it to air B in the tail screen.
2808000	2810000	So the one thing that's a bit
2810000	2812000	hard about this game
2812000	2814000	is there should be a heart down here.
2814000	2815000	Yes!
2816000	2817000	I got a piece of heart.
2817000	2819000	I only need two more.
2819000	2821000	And I think there's one more in here.
2823000	2825000	I mean, I guess we could open up this,
2825000	2826000	but I just don't like doing anything.
2826000	2828000	Give him the souk jar.
2829000	2830000	Now
2831000	2833000	I don't know what one it is.
2833000	2834000	Oh, there it is.
2835000	2837000	Yeah, you can like find hidden things.
2837000	2839000	Ten mysterious shells.
2839000	2841000	We don't know what the shells are for yet.
2842000	2843000	Oh, I don't know.
2844000	2846000	So all those tiles that are like dusty
2847000	2848000	basically
2849000	2850000	we want to clean them up
2850000	2852000	because I think they give like hidden
2852000	2853000	rewarding stuff.
2854000	2855000	But we can just do it like that.
2855000	2856000	It's up.
2859000	2861000	Oh, we've unlocked a portal to that heart.
2861000	2862000	That's so good.
2862000	2864000	Okay, so when they have no dust on them,
2864000	2865000	they're vulnerable.
2865000	2867000	When they have no dust on them,
2867000	2868000	they're vulnerable.
2872000	2873000	Did we get anything
2873000	2875000	if we could perish them all in this room though?
2878000	2879000	No, we didn't.
2881000	2883000	I think there's a chest under this one
2883000	2884000	because look at the fireplace.
2884000	2886000	Yeah, look at the fireplace, man.
2886000	2889000	The game like literally screaming in your face
2889000	2891000	like there's something hidden here.
2891000	2893000	Please look for it.
2893000	2895000	Okay, I don't think we have to do them all.
2896000	2898000	I guess super suck.
2899000	2900000	Can I suck them?
2900000	2901000	Oh, I can.
2903000	2904000	Man, push it.
2910000	2912000	Now there's a puzzler.
2912000	2914000	I suspect there's not much more we can do here right now.
2914000	2915000	Let's press on.
2915000	2918000	Perhaps we can work this from another angle later on.
2918000	2920000	So the game, right, I got a bit...
2920000	2921000	Wait, wait, wait.
2921000	2922000	Can I touch that chest?
2922000	2924000	Sorry, let me touch that chest.
2924000	2925000	I never even tried.
2927000	2929000	The game is very nice.
2929000	2930000	Yeah, okay, we can touch it.
2930000	2931000	Listen here then.
2931000	2932000	I thought remember.
2933000	2934000	You got a compass.
2934000	2936000	Use it to find locations of hidden items.
2938000	2940000	I don't remember this in childhood.
2941000	2942000	Oh!
2943000	2944000	Wow, big.
2945000	2946000	Big, big, big, big.
2946000	2948000	Okay, head up back out.
2949000	2950000	Okay, just start again.
2952000	2954000	I almost certainly touched the chest.
2954000	2956000	A new hand touches the chest.
2959000	2961000	Do you want to touch the chest?
2961000	2962000	Wow!
2962000	2965000	Oh, I will say one thing about these older games.
2965000	2970000	It hurts my soul when you, like,
2970000	2974000	defeat the enemies, but they don't stay defeated.
2975000	2977000	That's the only thing that hurts me.
2978000	2980000	Okay, we've got our mysterious shells.
2980000	2984000	Oh, mysterious shells.
2985000	2986000	Wait, wait.
2987000	2990000	No, we need to fall down in here.
2993000	2996000	Are you ready for Lily Padling?
2999000	3001000	Can I hurt you from here?
3001000	3002000	I can!
3002000	3004000	The game actually registers as a different height.
3005000	3006000	No war.
3006000	3009000	Unless you find a way to travel by water,
3009000	3011000	we want to be going much farther.
3011000	3014000	We are now going down Lily Pad Lover's Lane.
3015000	3016000	And then I just pop it.
3020000	3023000	I'm actually surprised the game registers height like that.
3023000	3025000	I thought I could kill that, but I don't know.
3026000	3027000	I can't believe it.
3027000	3029000	They actually made a quality game.
3031000	3034000	I don't know how close they need to be.
3034000	3035000	Yeah, there we go.
3036000	3043000	Um, I think it's just a reward if we go this way.
3046000	3048000	Oh, no, it's not.
3048000	3049000	There's a key.
3049000	3050000	We need a key, but we don't have it.
3050000	3052000	Lover's Boatwright Destroyer.
3052000	3055000	Literally, we're on Lily Pad Lover's Lane or something.
3055000	3059000	All the raids are always called that Lover's Lane.
3060000	3063000	It comes to those romantical ones.
3063000	3065000	A bit romantical.
3066000	3068000	Right, this one.
3069000	3071000	Oh, I could probably actually use that one.
3071000	3072000	Oh, Lover.
3073000	3075000	We just need a classic pot on the switch.
3076000	3077000	Very good game.
3079000	3082000	Yeah, like, see how I wasn't even facing that enemy,
3082000	3084000	but the game was still like, yeah, you got him.
3085000	3087000	Have I got my blank?
3088000	3090000	Ah, my blank is not here.
3091000	3093000	I'm gonna have to come back.
3093000	3095000	I'm gonna have to go get him.
3096000	3097000	Because I'm hurting my leg.
3097000	3098000	I'm killing the circulation.
3098000	3100000	Oh, this is not looking good.
3101000	3102000	Got a small key.
3102000	3105000	Yeah, you don't have to specify it small
3105000	3106000	every time you talk about it, okay?
3106000	3108000	I'm starting to feel personally attacked
3108000	3110000	and I don't even have any in there.
3111000	3113000	And the game cannot stop.
3114000	3115000	Yay.
3116000	3117000	Set properly.
3117000	3119000	Literally, my legs are against the table
3119000	3120000	and it's caught in circulation.
3120000	3121000	I should take a picture of my legs
3121000	3123000	to show you how severe it is.
3124000	3126000	I'll maybe do that.
3128000	3129000	Oh!
3129000	3130000	Link.
3131000	3132000	Buddy.
3132000	3133000	Buddy.
3135000	3137000	Small key to go with that
3137000	3139000	embarrassingly small shield.
3139000	3141000	Literally, I was like, wait a minute.
3141000	3143000	This is the dialogue I was...
3144000	3145000	Oh!
3145000	3147000	I thought, I thought, I was just like,
3147000	3148000	have I done that wrong?
3148000	3150000	No, I can suck on this.
3153000	3154000	Oh, dude.
3156000	3157000	What did we get?
3157000	3159000	You got the big key.
3160000	3161000	Oh, thank you, game.
3161000	3162000	You're so nice.
3162000	3164000	Thank you for complimenting me.
3164000	3165000	I appreciate it.
3165000	3167000	Oh, we can get that other heart piece.
3170000	3171000	I think I got it.
3172000	3174000	Okay, let's grab that now.
3174000	3176000	See, if I grabbed that one at the freaking start,
3176000	3178000	we would have had a new heart container.
3179000	3182000	Link is the reason there's a main-the-gap scene.
3184000	3188000	I don't really remember if it's left or right.
3189000	3191000	Oh, oh, it doesn't matter.
3192000	3194000	We got 20 rupees!
3194000	3195000	We're rich!
3195000	3196000	We're rich!
3197000	3198000	Gold!
3198000	3199000	We're rich.
3200000	3201000	Okay.
3202000	3204000	That's an impressive amount of suction.
3205000	3206000	Thanks!
3208000	3210000	I'm sure if I was more awake,
3210000	3213000	I could probably do something right now.
3214000	3215000	Was that a joke?
3216000	3217000	Oh, wait!
3217000	3218000	Something, something, suck.
3219000	3220000	Oh, wait!
3221000	3223000	Oh, no, it didn't open up my little sound thing.
3223000	3224000	You guys can't hear it.
3224000	3225000	Hold on.
3226000	3227000	Hold on, hold on.
3227000	3228000	Let me open it up.
3228000	3229000	Sorry, sorry.
3229000	3231000	Something, something, suck.
3232000	3233000	Oh, thank you.
3233000	3234000	Thank you.
3234000	3235000	Thank you.
3235000	3236000	You're far too kind.
3237000	3240000	Right, you ready for first boss fight?
3244000	3245000	Wow, that was really funny.
3245000	3246000	Yes, exactly.
3247000	3248000	No, please laugh.
3249000	3250000	Wow!
3250000	3252000	It's a little slamer.
3253000	3255000	Right, you ready for first boss fight?
3256000	3257000	Can we do it?
3259000	3260000	Oh, no.
3261000	3263000	He's coming through into the temple.
3273000	3275000	So you have to suck his bottom.
3280000	3283000	And then he'll get a wobbly head like that.
3284000	3286000	And he'll follow you and like collapse on you.
3287000	3288000	And then you just...
3292000	3293000	Okay, and then he gets back up again.
3294000	3295000	That boss literally being...
3295000	3297000	Is that how I would defeat you?
3297000	3299000	Just give it a little cheeky.
3300000	3304000	And then he gets quite a bit strong...
3304000	3305000	Oops, sorry.
3305000	3306000	I pointed the wrong way there.
3307000	3309000	Okay, and then, yeah.
3309000	3311000	It's a really good boss fight.
3311000	3312000	I think it's really...
3312000	3313000	Oh!
3316000	3319000	I can't hit the button any faster.
3320000	3322000	I think he jumps for a bit now.
3323000	3324000	You don't want to...
3327000	3328000	Oh, wait, no.
3328000	3329000	I think he infinitely jumps.
3330000	3331000	Oh, no, he doesn't.
3331000	3332000	I lied.
3332000	3333000	He doesn't infinitely jump.
3333000	3334000	I don't know why I thought he did.
3335000	3336000	Oh, he's almost there.
3336000	3337000	He's so skinny.
3338000	3339000	Oh.
3340000	3342000	Now, if we have done it correctly,
3342000	3345000	he should be down when he foxes we had done.
3349000	3350000	There we go.
3350000	3352000	Spam, spam, spam!
3353000	3354000	Hey!
3354000	3355000	We did it!
3355000	3356000	Yippee!
3356000	3357000	First boss down.
3360000	3362000	He'll send it to the music.
3362000	3363000	Okay.
3365000	3366000	Danny turned the game up.
3372000	3374000	We have gained the earth.
3374000	3376000	You got the earth element.
3377000	3381000	The power of the earth is the source of all living things.
3381000	3384000	The earth element is the embodiment of that power.
3386000	3387000	Sounds like a lean acquire.
3388000	3390000	You got a heart container.
3390000	3393000	Your life energy has increased and has been replenished.
3397000	3400000	Pushybee, strongy shoots down the slime.
3400000	3401000	I just...
3401000	3403000	Right, I'm happy to discuss this.
3403000	3407000	No, there is absolutely no slime in development for Gen 2 or Gen 3.
3407000	3409000	I have no interest in the slime.
3409000	3412000	Slimes are incredibly hard to design.
3412000	3415000	Like, if you think of Sue from Monster Musume and all of that,
3415000	3416000	it's just...
3416000	3417000	There's nothing to it.
3417000	3419000	There's nothing fun about it.
3419000	3420000	Just any...
3420000	3422000	Now, for a Halloween outfit, sure.
3422000	3425000	The girls can go nuts if they all want to slime variations.
3425000	3428000	Sure, knock yourself out because there's going to be nothing to it.
3428000	3430000	Ah, we've got the earth element.
3431000	3433000	We've got the earth element.
3433000	3435000	You must go and tell the elder at once.
3437000	3441000	Unfortunately, I don't think we can come back and get this heart until later,
3441000	3442000	which is fine.
3442000	3444000	It's not actually a big deal.
3445000	3447000	But I know for a fact I'm going to forget it's there.
3447000	3448000	And then I'm going to be like,
3448000	3450000	Eh, where are all these hearts hiding?
3452000	3453000	That doesn't...
3453000	3455000	Okay, well, we'll have to do that then.
3456000	3458000	Yeah, so there's no slime in production.
3459000	3461000	So, you have found the earth element.
3462000	3468000	You are blessed with much courage and strength for once young.
3468000	3469000	If you are...
3469000	3472000	If you are conviction and strong,
3472000	3474000	head to Mount Crennel.
3475000	3480000	There, you will find a man named Meliari among all of the Minish.
3480000	3483000	There is no one more able to repair your sword.
3483000	3485000	If you ask him,
3485000	3490000	I am certain you will reforge your broken pecorri blade.
3490000	3493000	I shall send the world to him in advance.
3494000	3496000	Travel safely, you are brave,
3496000	3500000	but there are so many evil in the world.
3501000	3504000	I'm so sorry if there's any French.
3504000	3506000	Désolé, Français.
3507000	3508000	People.
3510000	3512000	If you screw the door here,
3512000	3514000	it will take you out of the forest.
3516000	3518000	Great Eldor, we are in your debt.
3518000	3520000	We shall head for Mount Crennel at once.
3521000	3522000	Oh, excuse me.
3522000	3524000	Sorry, excuse me.
3524000	3526000	Oh my God!
3526000	3528000	Oh my God, we need to...
3528000	3530000	We need to make our village like
3530000	3533000	hobbit and Minish related and
3533000	3535000	like this is so cute.
3535000	3537000	Imagine everyone had their own bedroom
3537000	3539000	and then like one by one I come and wake you up
3539000	3541000	and maybe not wake you up
3541000	3543000	but just in my room.
3544000	3546000	Alright, what's going on in this mushroom?
3546000	3547000	Hi!
3547000	3548000	Hello!
3548000	3550000	Green clothes
3550000	3552000	and a mystical eye.
3554000	3555000	Can we hear Brian?
3558000	3561000	I'm one of the reeflings you beat in Connect 4,
3561000	3562000	so I'm dumb,
3562000	3564000	but I'll catch up tonight either way.
3564000	3566000	Enjoy it strongly.
3566000	3569000	The members stream is a tier list.
3569000	3571000	It's not like any game player or anything.
3571000	3574000	Thank you, Tiny Spiny, for the tip.
3574000	3575000	I appreciate it.
3576000	3577000	Strongie is so anti-slim
3577000	3580000	because she wants to turn herself into a slim cutfish.
3580000	3583000	Just feel like reeflings look so slim now.
3583000	3585000	Green clothes and a mystical hat.
3585000	3587000	Sir, would you have a chance to be linked,
3587000	3589000	the one who found the earth element?
3589000	3590000	Surely you are.
3590000	3592000	I've heard so many tales about you.
3592000	3594000	I am Belary,
3594000	3596000	researcher of antiques.
3596000	3599000	I am also, oh well, a bit of an inventor.
3599000	3602000	You know, you won't be able to get back to your town
3602000	3604000	due to all the debris.
3604000	3607000	Here, I have something that might come in handy.
3608000	3611000	Bomb bag!
3612000	3614000	And it has 10 bombs in it.
3614000	3616000	Now you can blow up lots of stuff.
3618000	3619000	For free?
3619000	3622000	Let me know if you find it useful.
3622000	3624000	Sure, thank you so much.
3624000	3625000	That was so kind of you.
3625000	3626000	I appreciate that.
3627000	3629000	I now have Bomba.
3629000	3631000	The child now has access to C4.
3632000	3633000	We will check these.
3633000	3635000	Holder of the Sacred Powers.
3635000	3637000	We grant you the power of wind.
3639000	3640000	Well, it blew up.
3640000	3643000	Hey kid, look where that stone marker used to be.
3643000	3647000	There's some strange symbol on the ground.
3647000	3649000	Yes, of course, why this must be...
3649000	3652000	Well, I haven't the foggy, to be honest with you.
3654000	3656000	We will learn later what that does.
3656000	3658000	If I go up, what's up?
3658000	3659000	Minish stuff.
3659000	3661000	Minish stuff, don't mind me.
3661000	3662000	We are not ready.
3662000	3664000	So we're going to equip our Chicky Bomb.
3664000	3666000	Chicky Bomb de la.
3666000	3668000	We cannot use our sword against that,
3668000	3671000	so we're just going to have our freakin' C4 out.
3674000	3675000	Um...
3677000	3679000	Where did you come from?
3683000	3685000	I can't remember what's over here.
3685000	3687000	So let's go for it.
3689000	3690000	Oh, Bomba.
3694000	3696000	Okay, what's in here?
3698000	3702000	Thank you, Meat Man 53, for becoming a Mimble.
3703000	3704000	Hello.
3704000	3706000	Hey, look at this Kinstone piece.
3706000	3708000	Have you ever seen one like this?
3708000	3709000	What?
3709000	3711000	You don't know what a Kinstone piece is?
3711000	3712000	Well, I'll tell you what.
3712000	3714000	Why don't you come back and see me when you get one, okay?
3714000	3717000	Okay, we need to go into town
3717000	3721000	and unlock Kinstone pieces next.
3721000	3724000	And then we'll come back to this nice little...
3724000	3726000	Oh, there's a Bomba.
3726000	3728000	There's a lot of things that need bombs.
3728000	3729000	Holy crap.
3729000	3731000	They were like, yeah, you unlock bombs now?
3731000	3733000	Oh, there's bats!
3735000	3737000	I don't want it to hurt me.
3737000	3738000	I got 20.
3738000	3740000	Whoa.
3740000	3743000	Mysterious shells.
3745000	3748000	I don't want to fight those guys because they're stinky.
3748000	3752000	I will bomb this though, just so we have access to the path.
3752000	3754000	Oh, you know what?
3754000	3755000	Well, we're here.
3755000	3756000	We're actually at the start of the forest.
3756000	3757000	I'm going to pick up that other heart
3757000	3759000	because that will be our fifth heart container.
3760000	3761000	Sorry, sorry.
3761000	3763000	I know I'm backtracking better than I know.
3763000	3764000	I know, I'm sorry.
3764000	3766000	Hey, you forgive me?
3766000	3768000	Oh, I just made that fall off.
3768000	3769000	What was up here again?
3769000	3770000	I already forgot.
3770000	3772000	Did I even check?
3772000	3774000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
3774000	3775000	Can't swim yet.
3775000	3776000	Can't swim.
3776000	3777000	That comes later.
3777000	3781000	We'll very quickly grab the heart of...
3781000	3783000	Peter, Andre, Jumpscare.
3783000	3785000	Was that his song?
3785000	3786000	Like, Mysterious Girl.
3786000	3787000	I remember...
3787000	3789000	Right, this is just so British, yeah?
3789000	3792000	So if you have no idea who Peter, Andre, or Katie price is.
3792000	3793000	Ta-da!
3793000	3795000	We now have five heart stones.
3795000	3797000	That's magnificent.
3797000	3798000	Magnificent.
3801000	3804000	This game only has four dungeons, right?
3804000	3808000	Yeah, we are technically one fourth of the way through the game.
3808000	3810000	Because once you pick up all the elements,
3810000	3813000	things go very quickly after that.
3813000	3815000	Like, very, very quickly.
3815000	3818000	Okay, we are now going to hit the town, boys.
3826000	3827000	And now that we have a sword,
3827000	3830000	we can clear out any stuff that's in the way.
3830000	3833000	High rule town, so it's no longer in celebration mode.
3833000	3834000	Oh.
3838000	3839000	Come one, come all!
3839000	3842000	See how many kingstone pieces you can collect.
3842000	3845000	You never know what fusing kingstones will do,
3845000	3846000	but it's sure to be good.
3846000	3849000	Come on up and get your free kingstone bag
3849000	3851000	for holding your kingstone pieces.
3851000	3853000	Don't miss out on this incredible
3853000	3855000	once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
3855000	3859000	Yes, yes, you're here for your free kingstone bag, aren't you?
3859000	3861000	That's right, maybe you didn't hear me,
3861000	3864000	but they're free for all kids right now.
3864000	3867000	You got king, kingstone bag.
3867000	3868000	You can now carry kingstone pieces,
3868000	3870000	so we're going to go back to that other one.
3870000	3872000	This guy looks like a scumbazer.
3874000	3876000	Fitting two kingstone pieces together
3876000	3878000	is called kingstone fusion.
3878000	3880000	If you get two pieces to fit perfectly,
3880000	3883000	great happiness will come your way.
3883000	3885000	I'll put the kingstone pieces in your kingstone bag
3885000	3887000	so you can give it...
3887000	3889000	If I read kingstone one more time, you're done.
3889000	3890000	You're done.
3890000	3891000	Nah, I'm not reading that.
3891000	3893000	Anyone who's willing to fuse the stones
3893000	3895000	would look like how I do.
3895000	3896000	When you see that look in their eyes,
3896000	3899000	that's when you press the left trigger.
3899000	3902000	Use to choose the kingstone pieces
3902000	3904000	and press this button.
3904000	3905000	Did you catch all of that?
3905000	3907000	Yes, do not ever repeat that again.
3907000	3908000	Yes.
3908000	3911000	Then stand in front of me and press E.
3911000	3914000	Yes, yes, that's it. Press E.
3914000	3916000	What does it do?
3916000	3917000	The pieces fit together.
3917000	3919000	Maybe something good will happen.
3921000	3923000	Free kidney stones?
3923000	3925000	Wow, where's that?
3925000	3928000	I think that's bottom right of our house.
3928000	3930000	So we'll give it a little check.
3930000	3931000	We'll give it a check.
3931000	3932000	It is bottom right of our house.
3932000	3933000	I knew it. I knew it.
3933000	3934000	I recognise it.
3934000	3935000	A perfect fit.
3935000	3937000	That means we're both dudes for happiness soon.
3937000	3938000	I'll see you.
3938000	3939000	Okay.
3939000	3945000	Now, in order to acquire these pieces,
3945000	3949000	you basically just get them naturally
3949000	3952000	from cutting grass and stuff
3952000	3954000	and doing your chores.
3954000	3956000	They appear out of the bushes.
3956000	3958000	And you can buy them in a shop as well.
3958000	3960000	But of course, none of them are spawning.
3960000	3962000	That would be far too easy.
3962000	3964000	Maybe in the grass?
3964000	3966000	Hello, is anyone hating the grass?
3967000	3969000	Nothing is spawning.
3969000	3971000	I wonder if we have to progress again a bit more.
3974000	3976000	Not one piece in the grass.
3976000	3977000	Oh, spider!
3979000	3981000	We're fine, we're safe.
3982000	3983000	Bruh.
3983000	3985000	Nothing is spawning.
3985000	3987000	I mean, I'm not going to say no to the rupees
3987000	3989000	because we're going to have to end up buying them.
3989000	3990000	They're a rare drop.
3990000	3991000	Oh, we got a heart!
3991000	3992000	You got a piece of a heart.
3992000	3995000	Collect four to make energy.
4001000	4003000	I didn't think they were that rare.
4003000	4004000	Oh!
4004000	4005000	There we go.
4005000	4006000	These mystic stones bring happiness.
4006000	4007000	Yes.
4007000	4008000	I didn't think they were that rare.
4008000	4009000	I think they're relative.
4009000	4011000	Holder of the sacred powers,
4011000	4013000	we grant you the power of the wind.
4013000	4014000	Hey!
4014000	4015000	Oh, sorry.
4015000	4016000	You know what?
4016000	4017000	No matter how many times I see that,
4017000	4018000	it still rouses me
4018000	4020000	because he doesn't know what the symbol is.
4020000	4022000	Right, we're going to go back to that little guy
4022000	4024000	because he was really excited
4024000	4026000	to tell us about Kin Stones or something.
4027000	4028000	Where was he?
4028000	4029000	He was down here.
4034000	4035000	Hi, buddy!
4035000	4036000	We're back!
4037000	4038000	Just like you asked.
4038000	4040000	Right, what would you like to tell us
4040000	4042000	about these magical Kin Stones pieces?
4042000	4043000	Hello!
4044000	4046000	I just planted a big old bean.
4046000	4047000	It hasn't sprouted yet
4047000	4049000	but when it does, I'm going to be...
4052000	4053000	If it hasn't sprouted,
4053000	4054000	but when it does,
4054000	4056000	it's going to be a big sucker.
4058000	4059000	Don't say it.
4059000	4060000	Don't say it, chat.
4061000	4062000	Don't say it, refunds.
4063000	4065000	Okay, I guess he's telling us
4065000	4067000	that the bean stalks
4068000	4070000	will grow
4070000	4071000	via Kin Stones.
4072000	4074000	That's the only thing I can...
4074000	4075000	Shut up!
4075000	4077000	Wow, there's so many enemies in that area.
4077000	4078000	Right, I'm not bothering.
4079000	4080000	Oh!
4080000	4083000	That's what I get for not paying attention.
4083000	4085000	I'm just getting absolutely
4085000	4086000	blasted at what it was.
4086000	4088000	Is there anything else in town we can do?
4088000	4090000	We might be able to speak to the martial artists.
4090000	4091000	Do you know that?
4092000	4093000	Hello!
4094000	4096000	Oh my god, it's the wee chickadee!
4097000	4099000	Oh my god, he's so cute!
4100000	4101000	He's a thing.
4103000	4104000	Hello?
4104000	4105000	Speak.
4105000	4107000	I am Swiftblade,
4107000	4109000	finest swordman in all of Hyrule.
4109000	4111000	If you train with me,
4111000	4114000	I guarantee that you will increase your skills dramatically.
4114000	4116000	So, would you like to train here?
4117000	4118000	Yes, please.
4120000	4123000	We shall start with the most basic of all techniques.
4123000	4124000	I shall teach you
4124000	4126000	the spin attack.
4126000	4128000	First, press and hold your sword button.
4128000	4131000	Second, build up enough power.
4131000	4135000	Third, release your destructive might.
4135000	4137000	That's all, young swordsman.
4137000	4138000	Do you understand?
4138000	4139000	Yes.
4140000	4141000	Ha ha ha!
4141000	4142000	Very good.
4142000	4144000	You are a very quick student.
4144000	4147000	But you must feel the technique,
4147000	4148000	not just hear about it.
4148000	4151000	That's why I will now possess your body,
4151000	4153000	so as you demonstrate the technique,
4153000	4155000	I call this the
4155000	4158000	Swiftblade Position Technique of Training.
4158000	4159000	Watch this!
4162000	4164000	Position!
4170000	4171000	Yeah!
4171000	4172000	Phew!
4172000	4174000	Now you must try it yourself.
4174000	4176000	Press and hold your sword button.
4176000	4177000	Build up enough power.
4177000	4179000	Then release your destructive might.
4179000	4181000	That's all there is to it.
4182000	4185000	Yeah!
4186000	4187000	Yes, fine work.
4187000	4188000	You're a quick study.
4188000	4191000	I will now give you this Tiger Scroll.
4191000	4193000	If you ever forget this technique,
4193000	4195000	you can review it with the scroll.
4195000	4198000	You may view it at any time from the quest screen.
4198000	4200000	You learned the secret spin attack,
4200000	4201000	baiting technique.
4201000	4203000	This is the first sword technique
4203000	4206000	you've learned from Master Swiftblade.
4206000	4208000	Right, we're going to leave and come back in
4208000	4210000	because he might teach me something new
4210000	4212000	because I unlocked the Earthstone.
4212000	4214000	There are no more techniques I can teach you
4214000	4216000	with your current sword.
4216000	4218000	Okay, okay, when we upgrade your sword.
4218000	4221000	This guy is treating us like the kings
4221000	4223000	under a prana.
4223000	4225000	Aw, that's so cute!
4230000	4232000	Oh, I just remembered.
4232000	4233000	If you clear this up,
4233000	4235000	there should be a new guy that comes in.
4237000	4239000	Aw, I think it's a kinsome guy, actually.
4239000	4241000	Oh my god, there's a bakery?
4241000	4243000	Oh my god, reeflings!
4243000	4245000	What do you want to eat?
4245000	4246000	Sniffs it?
4246000	4249000	Mmm, doesn't that smell spectacular?
4249000	4251000	Perhaps they give you free samples.
4251000	4253000	I say, would you ask for me?
4253000	4255000	Do reeflings want sandwich,
4255000	4257000	a pie,
4257000	4258000	a croissant,
4258000	4260000	or a bread?
4260000	4261000	Sand.
4261000	4262000	Oh, you want sand?
4262000	4263000	Okay, sand.
4263000	4264000	Sand.
4264000	4266000	Good morning.
4266000	4268000	Uh, Ichi-sando?
4268000	4270000	Please?
4270000	4272000	Welcome!
4272000	4274000	You've come to the one and only
4274000	4276000	bakery of Wheaton & Pitter!
4276000	4278000	As in, Wheat & Pitterbread?
4278000	4280000	Wheat on Pitter!
4280000	4282000	Whoa, you don't need to jump on her in the bakery.
4282000	4284000	This tasty slice of cake,
4284000	4286000	which may or may not have something special inside,
4286000	4288000	it's a moist and cream filled
4288000	4290000	bargain. It's only 60!
4292000	4294000	I don't have 60 rupees on my...
4294000	4296000	I'm a child!
4296000	4298000	Jeez, how much is this then?
4298000	4300000	How much is the pie?
4300000	4302000	Welcome, you've come? Yeah, no, no.
4302000	4304000	A slice of her fantastic fruit pie,
4304000	4306000	which may or may not have something inside.
4306000	4307000	40!
4307000	4309000	I'm a child, lady!
4309000	4310000	Jeez, Louise!
4310000	4313000	Right, you guys are getting a croissant and taking it, right?
4313000	4315000	Yes, yes, yes.
4315000	4316000	Right, how much is a croissant?
4316000	4317000	Okay, it's there.
4317000	4319000	You guys can eat the croissant,
4319000	4320000	sit down, shut up, and eat it,
4320000	4321000	because I know you didn't want it,
4321000	4323000	but you can still get it.
4323000	4325000	Oh, you got a kid's stone face!
4325000	4327000	Thank you, refling!
4327000	4329000	Thank you for not swallowing it.
4329000	4331000	I didn't really want it if it came out long ago.
4331000	4333000	Hmm, hmm.
4333000	4335000	Must make deliciousness.
4335000	4337000	Aww, it's so cute.
4337000	4339000	Did you enjoy it?
4339000	4340000	I want its anger.
4340000	4342000	I'm too poor, okay?
4342000	4344000	Look,
4344000	4347000	you gave me an entire generation.
4347000	4349000	I have five kids to look after.
4349000	4351000	I have reflings to look after.
4351000	4353000	And I might currently be pregnant
4353000	4355000	with Gen 2.
4355000	4357000	I don't know yet what's happening.
4357000	4359000	Uh, right.
4359000	4361000	Is there anything else?
4361000	4364000	The dog's in the way, so that's locked off.
4368000	4370000	We can give you more generations,
4370000	4371000	but my pie!
4371000	4373000	I'm not money enough.
4373000	4374000	I don't have enough money.
4374000	4375000	What do you think?
4375000	4376000	Speak.
4376000	4377000	Well, if it isn't Link,
4377000	4379000	it is good to see you again.
4379000	4380000	The school is in session.
4380000	4382000	I'm afraid I can't let you in.
4382000	4383000	Oh my god, that's right.
4383000	4385000	He's like a literal child
4385000	4387000	going about the map health.
4393000	4395000	What are you?
4396000	4398000	Buggy buggy boo.
4398000	4399000	Did I scare you?
4399000	4400000	No.
4400000	4403000	Oh, there's like this silly chicken game.
4403000	4404000	Oh no, this is horrible.
4404000	4406000	My cocoons have gotten out.
4406000	4407000	Can you help me catch them?
4407000	4409000	Try to catch two of them, please.
4410000	4411000	Yoink!
4412000	4414000	Get back in the pen!
4414000	4416000	Okay, we only need two, so that's fine.
4420000	4421000	Is that making a weird noise?
4421000	4423000	It sounds like scratching.
4424000	4425000	Weird.
4425000	4427000	Oh, there's a golden one.
4427000	4428000	I got a golden ch-
4428000	4429000	Ah!
4429000	4430000	Get back here!
4430000	4432000	No, you're going back in your pen.
4432000	4434000	Naughty chicken.
4434000	4436000	Okay, time's up, that's it.
4438000	4439000	Thanks, here's your reward.
4439000	4440000	Ten seers-
4440000	4442000	What did I do with the shells?
4443000	4444000	Oh, she gave me 30 rupees.
4444000	4446000	Maybe I can get your sandwich.
4449000	4452000	A literal child being sent to just kill a wizard.
4453000	4455000	I love those memes that are like,
4455000	4457000	summarise the game in one sentence,
4457000	4459000	like completely out of context.
4460000	4463000	Child sent to kill wizard is pretty accurate.
4463000	4464000	Alright, what do I even need to do?
4464000	4465000	Sorry.
4465000	4468000	I am having a fun time just giving off
4468000	4470000	and enjoying this game for what it's worth.
4473000	4474000	Oh!
4474000	4476000	Sorry, I got a little excited looking at the water there.
4476000	4477000	Oh!
4478000	4479000	Bees!
4480000	4481000	I don't want to take them yet
4481000	4483000	because I don't have anything to put them in.
4485000	4487000	There was an enemy up ahead.
4491000	4494000	Next time we go back to town,
4494000	4496000	I will get your cake.
4496000	4497000	Even though-
4497000	4498000	Oh!
4498000	4499000	Well, we can't go that way.
4499000	4500000	Hold on.
4500000	4501000	We need to go up.
4504000	4506000	Every additional chicken gets you more money
4506000	4507000	even if it's for going on.
4507000	4508000	Ah, okay, okay.
4509000	4510000	So I should get going.
4510000	4511000	Oh!
4511000	4512000	He wants to do that thing.
4512000	4514000	You want to fuse Kinstone?
4514000	4515000	Yeah, but-
4515000	4517000	Ah, I don't have what you need.
4519000	4520000	What about you?
4521000	4523000	I don't have what both of them needs?
4523000	4525000	What are the odds of that?
4528000	4529000	Now we're getting there.
4529000	4530000	You fuse.
4530000	4531000	You fuse.
4531000	4532000	Come.
4532000	4533000	Ah, come.
4533000	4534000	But they aren't open yet.
4534000	4535000	Hmm.
4537000	4538000	Okay.
4538000	4539000	Hello, can I get that?
4539000	4540000	Ho, ho.
4540000	4541000	So you've learned to spin attack.
4541000	4543000	It's still dangerous, but maybe you can handle it.
4544000	4546000	Oh, I didn't even know I needed that to progress.
4546000	4547000	Yeah, that's the one.
4547000	4549000	But there are monsters out there, kid.
4549000	4550000	Please just be careful.
4550000	4553000	I think he blocks you from going anywhere.
4554000	4555000	Okay.
4555000	4556000	It's two hits.
4556000	4557000	That's fine.
4557000	4558000	What are these?
4558000	4559000	Can I break them?
4559000	4560000	I can!
4560000	4563000	Well, I'm not fucking picking them all up manually.
4563000	4564000	Just down here.
4567000	4568000	Oh, Bomba!
4572000	4574000	They have got some timer on them.
4574000	4575000	Hello!
4575000	4577000	Oh, this is a merchant.
4577000	4578000	Hold on.
4579000	4581000	You need a dinkum.
4582000	4583000	Okay, you got me.
4583000	4584000	Let me make it up to you.
4584000	4585000	You can have this.
4585000	4587000	Do you have lots of bottles for 20?
4587000	4588000	Sure.
4588000	4589000	Give me up.
4589000	4590000	You got an empty bowl.
4590000	4591000	Thanks a lot.
4591000	4593000	Yes, we needed the bowl for...
4594000	4595000	Actually, we need...
4595000	4596000	This was...
4596000	4598000	I didn't even remember it was down here.
4598000	4601000	We needed the bowl for...
4602000	4605000	If not, we'll just have to make do with your cake instead.
4605000	4607000	How the frickin...
4607000	4609000	How did you guys do that?
4611000	4613000	That's really coordinated.
4613000	4614000	I'm sorry.
4614000	4616000	That's really coordinated doing that.
4620000	4621000	Here.
4627000	4628000	No, literally.
4628000	4631000	The only time you guys are like mega-coordinated is...
4631000	4632000	What's that?
4632000	4633000	Which is actually really funny.
4633000	4636000	Okay, there's nothing up here that we can do yet.
4636000	4637000	Reefling?
4637000	4638000	Hive?
4638000	4639000	Main?
4639000	4640000	I can't believe it.
4640000	4641000	Main broken?
4641000	4642000	I'm not even spanked at the first one yet,
4642000	4645000	where I get you to rename yourself for an hour or so.
4649000	4651000	Okay, this is why we need water.
4653000	4656000	Because it grows the beanstalk!
4659000	4660000	And then we'll grab more,
4660000	4661000	because I'm like,
4661000	4663000	God, we're really low on bombs.
4663000	4665000	I actually don't know how to get more.
4666000	4667000	Sure, grab.
4667000	4669000	Put this one out for now.
4669000	4672000	We used our single brain cell for the forces to do.
4672000	4674000	Oh, I need it.
4674000	4677000	Sorry, there is a lot of menus, like, speak.
4677000	4678000	Okay, you got me.
4678000	4680000	I'll make it up to you.
4680000	4683000	A friend of mine in the cave just east of here in the Highlands
4683000	4686000	has an item if you're planning to ongoing.
4686000	4688000	It won't let you get to the top,
4688000	4689000	but it might just help you get started.
4689000	4690000	Okay, that's fine.
4691000	4693000	I need more Keith down peep heads.
4693000	4694000	What?
4697000	4698000	Hmm.
4699000	4701000	Right, we're gonna grab this money up here.
4702000	4703000	I guess like 20.
4703000	4704000	Oh, we're at 40.
4704000	4707000	I still don't have enough for your signage though.
4707000	4709000	Look up here, nothing.
4711000	4713000	Luckily, I already did that, literally.
4713000	4716000	I'm doing everything in the right order by accident.
4718000	4721000	Right, we can't grip the walls yet.
4721000	4723000	I might just...
4723000	4725000	Oh, wait, there's something hidden under these.
4727000	4729000	Whoa, they hardly get affected.
4729000	4732000	There's a lot of enemies in this area.
4732000	4734000	Geez, whoa, wait!
4736000	4738000	Is there not a hidden thing around here?
4740000	4741000	Is it this?
4744000	4746000	Wow, there's a lot of enemies.
4747000	4750000	Is this just a secret bomb place?
4750000	4752000	It looks like we should do something here.
4753000	4754000	I'll just stay here.
4755000	4757000	Yeah, I was gonna say, that looks so...
4757000	4760000	Like, there's totally not a hidden thing here.
4764000	4765000	Oh, jelly blobs.
4771000	4773000	There's a question about the mysterious shells.
4773000	4775000	I can't remember what they're for.
4776000	4778000	Geez, I have one bomb left.
4779000	4781000	Why am I going here?
4784000	4787000	I think I might need to put it in the bottle.
4790000	4792000	I hope you're having a good time.
4792000	4795000	I'm in the middle of the hammer, I need to play childing again.
4795000	4799000	Oh, I don't think jumping on a gem would feel that good on your butt, but...
4799000	4801000	I guess the smaller you...
4801000	4803000	So this perfectly normal looking...
4803000	4807000	So this perfectly normal looking stone was another portal of the Minish world.
4807000	4809000	There may be other rock portals.
4809000	4811000	Keep your eyes peeled, boy.
4814000	4816000	Increase your chances when going for a figurine.
4816000	4817000	Oh, okay.
4818000	4819000	Okay, I can't.
4819000	4822000	If the enemies aren't attacking me, there's no point in...
4823000	4826000	Okay, yeah, I definitely need this liquid.
4829000	4830000	Why is it...
4830000	4835000	You've got Mount Serial's mineral water in your bottle.
4835000	4836000	It's piping hot?
4838000	4839000	Hmm.
4842000	4846000	Right, I'm going to detach it because I don't want to accidentally use it
4846000	4849000	because I definitely have to use it for something coming up.
4849000	4850000	Green mineral water.
4850000	4852000	You've got acid, literally.
4855000	4856000	See you, Yibi.
4856000	4857000	I know you can.
4860000	4862000	I only have one bomb left.
4862000	4863000	I don't want to use it on...
4863000	4864000	Oh, I'm sick.
4865000	4867000	There's a lot of merches nearby.
4867000	4868000	Hello.
4868000	4869000	Okay, you got me.
4869000	4871000	I'll make up to you by selling your bombs.
4874000	4876000	Wait, I've only got one bomb left?
4879000	4880000	Right, right.
4880000	4882000	Give me the freaking bombs over.
4882000	4883000	Yeah.
4883000	4884000	Thanks a lot.
4884000	4885000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4885000	4886000	Oh, I'm confused.
4886000	4887000	I have it!
4888000	4891000	The two pieces fit perfectly together.
4892000	4893000	Yibi!
4899000	4900000	A chest?
4900000	4901000	Okay, that's fine.
4902000	4904000	We do not have access to that area.
4905000	4906000	Unfortunately.
4906000	4907000	That's okay.
4907000	4910000	I might have to start scraping by and trying to pick up coins
4910000	4911000	because it's not looking good.
4911000	4914000	Okay, I see they purposely put that bomb there
4914000	4915000	because...
4915000	4916000	Hey, that guy.
4917000	4920000	Yeah, literally, they put a nice bomb cellar nearby
4920000	4921000	in case you're out,
4921000	4922000	and I'm like, yes, think of it.
4922000	4923000	It's so smart.
4925000	4927000	Oh, I don't know how far this goes.
4931000	4933000	Either a lot of acid or that's plankton.
4937000	4939000	Oh, I think...
4939000	4941000	Once you've pulled off their iron mask,
4941000	4943000	those guys are no trouble whatsoever.
4944000	4947000	I think we'll just avoid them, to be honest.
4947000	4950000	We don't really need to fight everything.
4954000	4956000	Of course, I'm silly of me.
4957000	4958000	Hey, my boy.
4958000	4960000	Jump into that whirlwind over there for me.
4961000	4964000	I wonder, is this a great idea or a terrible one?
4964000	4966000	I'll beat the crap out of this one.
4969000	4972000	Okay, now this becomes the fun part.
4972000	4973000	We're really...
4974000	4975000	Oh, I can't go up.
4975000	4976000	Oh, there we go.
4976000	4977000	I can't go up.
4978000	4979000	What's...
4979000	4980000	Ow!
4982000	4983000	What's over here?
4984000	4985000	Where's some more?
4985000	4986000	Eh?
4986000	4987000	There's a path.
4987000	4988000	Oh, well.
4988000	4990000	Tell me a bomb doesn't belong there.
4991000	4992000	You can't...
4993000	4994000	What's in here?
4996000	4998000	Okay, I'm gonna bomb for that.
5003000	5004000	Wow!
5007000	5009000	It'll take us down to five bombs.
5009000	5011000	Getting this, but we're gonna do it.
5011000	5012000	We're gonna send it.
5015000	5018000	Oh, a special Kingston piece.
5018000	5020000	It was blue, so I guess...
5020000	5021000	I'm 50!
5021000	5023000	I can buy your sandwich even though it's a cake!
5023000	5024000	But it looks like a sandwich,
5024000	5027000	but it makes sense that it was a cake because it's a bakery.
5028000	5031000	Leave me be, fellow beast.
5035000	5037000	Okay, this one looks like a succumon.
5038000	5040000	Oh, that's where the deco's!
5042000	5043000	That's where the slain...
5043000	5046000	I knew something had to be sucked up over here.
5051000	5052000	Wow!
5054000	5056000	150 rupees for a sanda.
5058000	5059000	Oh, hi!
5059000	5060000	See that?
5060000	5061000	See how we just sucked it up,
5061000	5062000	but it's already spun back in?
5062000	5064000	I wish they didn't do that.
5064000	5065000	Oh, wait!
5065000	5066000	I can't do that yet.
5066000	5068000	I need to move it.
5069000	5070000	Oh!
5072000	5074000	Wait, do I need to go there then?
5075000	5076000	Into the hole!
5077000	5078000	Okay.
5079000	5081000	We're gonna do it!
5082000	5083000	Oh!
5083000	5085000	Sorry, I got a bit excited there.
5086000	5090000	My biggest downfall in video games is just gaps.
5090000	5092000	I can't do it.
5093000	5094000	Who is putting this kind of shit?
5094000	5095000	Wait!
5097000	5098000	Oh, no.
5099000	5101000	Oh, no, this can't be.
5104000	5109000	I think I have missed a very detrimental item question mark.
5111000	5112000	Oh, I'm done again.
5112000	5113000	Sorry, sorry.
5113000	5114000	There was a gap.
5114000	5115000	There was a gap.
5118000	5126000	I am 99.9% sure I need some sort of weight lifting thing here
5126000	5130000	to move the plant over.
5130000	5132000	Oh, sorry, I'm getting caught.
5132000	5135000	And I don't have a...
5137000	5138000	Where is it?
5138000	5139000	Lift!
5139000	5140000	Wait!
5141000	5142000	Link!
5143000	5146000	You can just straight up lift that?
5146000	5149000	I thought there was some sort of item.
5149000	5151000	Is that later in the game?
5151000	5154000	Fuck it now, he's at time!
5154000	5155000	Sorry.
5155000	5157000	Oh, well, I did what I needed to do,
5157000	5160000	even if I sacrificed some of my health for it.
5160000	5162000	I did what needed to be done.
5162000	5165000	I don't even know how he's this strong.
5165000	5166000	I can't believe it.
5166000	5168000	Sorry, I'm wasting all my health.
5168000	5173000	Right, the reason why we need the green is this.
5179000	5182000	And now we are on Mount Creronell,
5182000	5185000	not to be confused with Mount Serials.
5185000	5187000	I used to see as a child.
5187000	5189000	I'm so funny as a child.
5190000	5192000	Okay, this is definitely a bomb.
5193000	5196000	Sorry, my stomach's making funky noises.
5197000	5198000	Let's hear it.
5199000	5201000	Weakest wiefling.
5203000	5205000	Oh, no way that dodged that.
5205000	5207000	That was like really good timing.
5210000	5211000	I wasn't here.
5211000	5213000	Another piece.
5213000	5214000	Curious.
5215000	5216000	Curious?
5216000	5217000	Hmm, curious.
5217000	5218000	Another piece.
5218000	5220000	Is the game telling me I should probably trade?
5220000	5221000	Whoa!
5221000	5223000	New enemy unlocked.
5224000	5227000	Okay, yes, I would like that heart very much, please.
5231000	5233000	I should have done that in the middle.
5233000	5235000	I just realized I wasted that.
5235000	5237000	Bomb bomb!
5237000	5240000	Oh, of course they have it in here.
5245000	5246000	Oh, wait, no!
5246000	5248000	I should have picked up.
5248000	5249000	Silly Billy.
5249000	5250000	Great.
5250000	5252000	I wonder if they always won.
5252000	5253000	I'm curious.
5261000	5266000	Well, I still have nightmares of the snake enemies that suck your money.
5266000	5267000	Give me your...
5267000	5269000	Aren't those just called women?
5269000	5270000	I'm sorry.
5270000	5273000	I tried so hard to make that joke really quickly.
5273000	5274000	It didn't work.
5274000	5276000	I don't need the wool.
5277000	5281000	I tried so hard to do that quickly and it completely started over my words
5281000	5282000	because my brain was like,
5282000	5283000	Yes, yes, the joke's there!
5283000	5284000	Say it, say it!
5284000	5286000	And, yeah.
5286000	5288000	Well, I tried, I tried, okay, I tried.
5289000	5290000	L'Bomba!
5295000	5296000	Wah.
5296000	5298000	Is he gonna give me the ring?
5298000	5300000	Are you kidding me right now?
5301000	5303000	Okay, fine, no, my money's getting sucked.
5303000	5304000	Okay, you got me.
5304000	5306000	I'll give you a fabulous grip ring.
5306000	5308000	It is perfect for a young mountaineer.
5308000	5310000	Climb 48.
5310000	5313000	Okay, lucky we got money on the way.
5313000	5314000	Thanks a lot.
5314000	5316000	Okay, now we can climb the wall.
5316000	5317000	Oh, we got five bombs again.
5317000	5319000	Oh, this is perfect.
5320000	5321000	Thank you.
5322000	5324000	K.F.P. Spidey.
5325000	5326000	Right, what way?
5326000	5327000	Short cut to bomb.
5327000	5328000	No, so what's up here?
5330000	5331000	Oh.
5335000	5336000	Oh.
5337000	5338000	We can't do that.
5340000	5342000	So, this is not the right way to go.
5342000	5344000	Shawnee doesn't need the grip ring.
5344000	5345000	She has that cover!
5345000	5346000	It's the...
5346000	5347000	Lip set.
5347000	5349000	It's the R slash lip set grip.
5350000	5351000	I'm so sorry.
5351000	5352000	Wait, what?
5353000	5355000	So, where am I supposed to go?
5355000	5356000	Okay.
5363000	5364000	Huh?
5364000	5366000	Am I supposed to go to the left?
5367000	5368000	I don't want to go...
5368000	5369000	Okay, there.
5369000	5370000	This is it.
5372000	5374000	You know that subreddit?
5374000	5377000	Yeah, I'm featured on it right now.
5377000	5380000	I'm trolling before anyone fucking goes and knocks me in.
5380000	5381000	Like, oh my god!
5381000	5382000	No, no, really.
5385000	5386000	Right, definitely.
5388000	5389000	Ahoy!
5389000	5390000	It's Emmy!
5390000	5391000	Any embers?
5391000	5392000	Any pen pals?
5392000	5393000	Me.
5399000	5400000	Please talk to me.
5401000	5402000	Talk to me.
5402000	5403000	Why don't you talk to me then?
5404000	5405000	Wait.
5405000	5406000	No!
5406000	5408000	You put water in your bottle,
5408000	5409000	and then you give her water.
5410000	5411000	You take her water,
5411000	5412000	then you give her water.
5415000	5416000	Oh!
5418000	5420000	Welcome to the Adventure Spring.
5420000	5422000	Did you throw the golden bomb
5422000	5424000	into the spring or the silver bomb?
5427000	5428000	Neither?
5430000	5431000	You are honest.
5431000	5433000	I must reward such an honest adventure
5433000	5435000	with some of my power.
5435000	5437000	You got a big bomb bag!
5437000	5439000	Now you can carry more bombah!
5439000	5441000	Thank you, mysterious lady.
5441000	5443000	May light shine on your quest.
5444000	5446000	Oh, she's so ethereal.
5447000	5448000	I love her.
5450000	5452000	This song sounds so familiar.
5452000	5453000	Yes, it is.
5453000	5455000	It's like, pretty much the default, like...
5456000	5457000	Hey, Zelda.
5457000	5459000	Take her water, and give her water.
5459000	5461000	She was just happy to get a bubble.
5461000	5463000	They have a spring cone.
5463000	5465000	She just wanted to do a spring cone.
5465000	5466000	Ah!
5466000	5467000	Ah!
5468000	5469000	I can't believe I suck.
5470000	5471000	Why is this...
5472000	5473000	I got a cavern.
5475000	5476000	I have a cavern.
5477000	5478000	There's a cavern.
5479000	5480000	I have a cavern.
5481000	5482000	I have a cavern.
5483000	5484000	I have a cavern.
5485000	5486000	I have a cavern.
5486000	5500640	I'm the Cranel, I'm the Cranel Hermit! I left the world to pursue a life of quiet reflection.
5500640	5506400	You seem to be but a child and yet you climb this forbidden mountain alone. I must reward
5506400	5512240	your courage with information. I have not seen a s- have you not seen strange patterned walls
5512240	5518160	as you climb this mountain? No? Bombs, bombs are the- oh he's telling me to nuke the fricking walls.
5518160	5523920	Yeah that's fine. The two kinstom pieces fit perfectly together, maybe something good will happen.
5525280	5527360	I didn't know you could take the water from the fairy town.
5528480	5532320	You learn something new every time you replay a childhood game.
5532480	5537200	What? How is that good?
5539920	5543280	How is that good? You've just- you've just created problems for me.
5547760	5550160	Okay, those are aggressive.
5552080	5556640	Ah! I don't know if I'll be able to- no I'm not gonna be able to in time, hold on.
5557280	5559680	Okay, suck them off. Get in my P.O.B.
5561840	5568000	Let's go. We are very high up if the- the fricking mountain top isn't even there.
5569280	5574880	Oh my goodness. All right, we can't do anything, we have to go- man we gotta go small.
5575520	5579440	Gotta take all off. Money? Oh is that what the golden snakes are?
5579440	5583280	They got Mario and Marshmallow doing here.
5588640	5592000	Oh, mushrooms-y owned by Nintendo.
5595200	5598080	These raindrops are like folders of water tails kid.
5598080	5601600	Watch out! If one of them hits us, it'll sting something fierce.
5605280	5609120	I'm getting rolled! Another good kind, I literally need new hearts.
5609120	5614320	I've only got three hearts. I'm drying them- wait can I push these? No I can't, I'm too small.
5615920	5619920	I'm just a baby. I'm gonna do a marshmallow.
5622160	5623760	Right, what do I need to do with this?
5627280	5634240	All right, I definitely need to push it that way. Then up. Then up again. Then a cheeky.
5635120	5644400	Left. Then up again. Then up again. Then a cheeky left. Then a left. Then a left.
5644400	5649120	Then a left. Then a no- then a down. And then a straight ahead.
5651120	5659120	Keep her going, keep her moving. Come on Link, you're so strong! You can do it! Link, you came to turn!
5660080	5663120	You came to save the Princess Zelda!
5671920	5677120	He's so strong. Oh, there's enemies at the bomb. Yeah, I knew it. I knew it.
5682160	5683280	We'll go this way, I think.
5684240	5688320	Uh, right, can I do this? No, let's do that one.
5690800	5697440	Oh my god, I'm literally guessing the freaking designer there lay out before- I've even activated it.
5698480	5705760	SHIT! I messed up. Oh, then he got all the way back because I messed up the last one I did.
5706720	5717760	Unless? No. What? Wait, unless. Hold on, unless we're being misled. Unless we're being misled!
5720240	5726400	It's your maiden smash force. I've never played it before. Should I play it before? Should I play it?
5727440	5732480	Thank you for the five delay lovers. Don't think I don't know your bleeding heart.
5733040	5740800	It's not a club, true name. I just think it's blood. Yes. I've never played it. I think Bayonetta.
5742480	5746320	Hold on a minute. Yeah, I saw that. I saw the pots and I was like, hold on a minute.
5746320	5754880	Is there pots on the other side? I think Bayonetta's in it, so I would probably play her when I play smash.
5755840	5762480	Wait, why are you lip-biting to that? Is that a game? Is that a sexy game? I thought it was Nintendo.
5762480	5769920	I was saying that Nintendo produced Bayonetta, which is like the most bomb shell. Is there something special in here?
5771040	5776080	Why are you hiding these pots from me? Oh, there's like a bomb behind them. Okay, that's fine.
5777040	5779440	I guess we need a bomb up ahead.
5792800	5797120	You can manually throw bombs if you need to. Okay, I don't really want to fight because I'm
5797120	5803520	pretty low health and not new health is spawning. Oh no, not another one of these, right? Okay.
5806720	5810640	Down, two left, and then down.
5814400	5821840	Okay, okay, okay, we're getting there. We're doing it. Then one, then up one, then left,
5822800	5827600	then north, then west, then push! We did it!
5827600	5832400	A scrawny can use her brain? Something.
5841600	5845280	Sugar, I might start up. Hold on, let me try that again. Wait, no.
5846960	5851520	Yeah, I can do it though. Okay, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it.
5852080	5859440	Anagong, a special console piece. Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry. Easy as connect for my life,
5859440	5865120	honestly. Oh, we did it! Look, look, look, this is a Minish camp. We're going to the Dwarven Minish.
5866240	5870080	The Dwarves of Erebor. I may be a bleeding heart now, but after that carry on,
5873120	5879520	oh, you can be. I'm not like one of those streamers that kind of get uncomfortable. As long as you're
5879520	5883680	happy, I'm happy. You enjoy the content and enjoy the content, you know?
5887680	5892080	But yeah, you guys, guys, did you know you have an infestation out there? Yeah?
5893040	5900960	Thank you for the five again, Delay Lover. Hello! Ting-a-long, tong-a-long, dig-a-long,
5900960	5906960	fer-eye. Wait, they're actually Scottish? Ting-a-long, tong-a-long, dig-a-long, fer-eye,
5907040	5913360	and they're Scottish? Ting-a-long, tong-a-long, dig-a-long, dig-a-long, dig-a-long,
5913360	5920480	dig-a-long, fer-eye, and they're Scottish? In here? Oh my god, they have communal,
5921200	5927520	they have communal bedding. Reflings, this is what I want. Oh my god, they're Scottish!
5928560	5934080	Hi! Hello, everyone! Oh my god, it's the kitchen where I make all the fit for the
5934080	5939760	reflings. What's that? We're having chicken again tonight? That's right, I'll let you use chicken.
5942240	5948320	Are you Scottish? Wait, I think, wait, is it in here? No, this is just a smith's room.
5949280	5952960	Okay, I think it might be down in here. Okay, definitely not there, that's how to progress.
5952960	5955760	Hello! Hello, everyone!
5958240	5967680	Green Clays, and an old hat! Sir, may you be young Link? I am Mellari, Master Smith. I hear you want
5967680	5973840	me to reforge the sacred sword and help break a curse. I'll be needing that old sword, which holds
5973840	5981040	the power of the elements first. Show me that broken PCORI blades. I love all this adventure,
5981600	5991040	with what's with the rescuing of princesses and such. I'd be happy to reforge this thing into a
5991040	6000880	brand new sacred blade for you. It'll take me a while to rework that sword. In the meantime,
6000880	6005920	you should try doing the missing elements. One of them should be in the mind of the human
6006480	6012320	dog. It's not far from here. All right, let's get started. Bunk!
6013360	6018080	Eh, there'll probably be a wee while, Link. Let's leave him to it and find the element.
6018080	6022880	Oh my god, Scotland kind of mentioned, even though it's just in the dialogue,
6022880	6027440	but I'll take it Scotland mentioned. What? You're going to the mine? If you talk to the
6027440	6034320	boss, I'm no storm here, but just be careful, laddie. Who goes there? Samwise! What nice name!
6034400	6040480	Well, welcome to the members, gang. I'm so sorry about, please forgive me.
6041840	6046000	Okay, hopefully we can get a heart in the mine. Holder of the sacred powers.
6046000	6052800	We grant you the power of the elements. Wow! Hey, that stone marker crumbled,
6052800	6056880	and there's another one of those symbols! You know what? No matter how many times I see this
6056960	6062480	happen, it still rattles me a bit. Who's the 10 out of 12? That's a bit of a hi.
6065200	6070320	Whoa! It's hot in here. Come on, let's not stand around wasting time. Find that element so we can
6070320	6075760	get the heck out here. I'm going to smash these for heart. Yeah, normally the game is very forgiving
6075760	6081760	and gives you what you need before you go next. Bums! What happens?
6081760	6086960	Okay, hit them! Oh!
6090640	6092320	Oh, so they do blow themselves up.
6095120	6098240	Whoa, the bomb bag is there, eh? Where are you?
6101040	6104720	Your sword won't make a dent in their thorny. Flip them over before you strike.
6105520	6111440	With a shield? With a shield? I'm remembering! I'm remembering!
6111840	6113520	Oh, I need the money so I can get cake.
6117840	6121840	Okay, after this one, I'll call a break and I'm going to make another honey tea to help my
6121840	6129760	throat, okay? But we're about to get the second element, okay? That's right, we're just so MLG
6129760	6136320	poor. I knew it! He's humping me! He's humping me!
6137280	6142240	Jeez, Louise! That was sheebie and a half right there.
6145760	6148000	How is sheebie and a half? That's like sheebie doing it.
6150240	6154080	Dude, do I upset the bombs if I do? Oh, I don't even upset the bombs.
6156000	6161760	Okay, I upset the bombs when I do that. Okay, okay. Wow, more bomb back.
6162720	6165760	These snakes, I hate them, literally.
6170000	6178000	Oh! You know the Binding of Isaac, right? So Eddie McMuffin, the guy that made the game,
6178720	6187360	Big Eddie McMuffin, he said that he was inspired by Legend of Zelda and he also mentioned...
6187680	6192720	Oh! This might be where the humans who built the mines used to be around here,
6192720	6196560	maybe we should hop in. Wait, what, after all this? There's nothing to be afraid of here,
6196560	6197440	come on, let's go!
6204960	6212800	Um, sweet jumpin' jellyfish! That was awful! Hey, kid, what are you smiling about? I knew it was
6212800	6218320	madness to risk our lives in that rickety human contraption. From now on, let's just stick to
6218320	6228480	our feet. Well, I mean, your feet. Um, yeah, he said that he was inspired. Isaac was inspired by
6228480	6236400	Legend of Zelda and if you ever do the alt path and the mines and all that, this exactly reminds me
6236400	6245280	of it. Uh, it's very... Ah, you can't go behind me, that's cheating! Let me equip my bomb buck.
6246160	6250480	Just wanted to do it to get in here. I'll put my shield back on though, right, right over here.
6254560	6257200	The snakes are called like, like, more like...
6258160	6266960	Ooh! Wait, that bombies guys? I know I'm supposed to spank their butts, but they're kind of, they're
6266960	6276240	kind of winning. Okay, hold on. Okay, two hits and they're gone. What? You're not supposed to actually
6276240	6283040	charge me. I heard that roofie drop. Don't think I didn't hear that roofie drop.
6283040	6289600	I'm interested. So there was a portal heading away in here. Hmm. Whenever you want me to shrink
6289600	6293680	you down, just hop on there and press the button. You know the drill. Right, give me that. Oh, I
6293680	6301120	thought it was a roofie. It was a hot, it was a hot. You can suck their masks away. Oh, okay, okay.
6301840	6307200	Will we get an Isaac stream anytime soon? Like an Eden run? Probably Eden run, maybe on a shorter
6307280	6316320	day. My dad is coming to visit. I am so tiny right now. I can't go in that, can I? I think that
6316320	6324080	kills me. Okay, I'm not going there. My dad's coming home, my dad's coming home. So July,
6325760	6334400	first two weeks are going to be relatively, I say relatively short streams, depending on
6335040	6342160	how cool my dad is because I'm pretty loud when I stream, let's be honest. Jump down there?
6343200	6353120	That seems dangerous. I do see the thing though. Okay, no, it is done there. So yes, July is kind
6353120	6359840	of maybe like two to four hour streams for the first two weeks and then we just get straight
6359840	6366640	back into, again, straight back into Endurance. Don't mind me. We'll be careful at these fires.
6366640	6372640	They do restore health, so I'm not going to, I'm going to beat around the bush. Got a dungeon map,
6372640	6378640	so if I ever get a old discombobulated and where I need to go, right, these time out, oh,
6380160	6384400	I'm terribly, these time out, but they do come back. Hold on, let me aim this a bit better.
6385280	6389600	Probably keeping them with the blue ones. I think the blue ones must be a vent or something. Oh my,
6389600	6394560	it looks really, really hot in that lava. Trust me, me who'd literally just perish two seconds
6394560	6398160	in four. Trust me, falling into that would be a bad idea. I'm sure you'd agree.
6400400	6403760	Yeah, you'll find you'll be able to watch other lives consistent. Well, because I stream like a
6403760	6410400	normal streamer, like, okay, thank you. Thank you for the two hours. I'm all flying now.
6410400	6418160	I am. It does mean, I will say one thing, it does mean a lot of like Ace Marble plays in that.
6418160	6431280	It'll be easier to make. Wait, this crumbles? Well, I need to pick it up. Pick up the booze.
6432000	6437840	Oh, sorry. Oh, well, that worked out really well actually. I need to get rid of the fire.
6437840	6444880	Oh, I just spanked. I missed it perfectly. Oh my God, reflings, I can get your Sango.
6446160	6453040	Go away. Go away. Oh, no, I need money for a sign, bitch. Okay, then.
6454000	6456000	Um.
6461840	6467440	What did I do? I go all the way around? Oh, I must do. Okay, we use the worldwinds
6467440	6472240	for all the way around on a big U-turn. Did you see the new Zelda trailer? Not yet, no.
6472240	6478080	I would play it, but I'm pretty sure trailers get copyright. Like, I used to...
6478880	6488320	Wait, did I? Oh, right, I push it all the way over. I used to think trailers and like anything
6488320	6494240	gameplay related was like non-copyrightable because they like purposely make it not that way,
6494240	6502000	but I've got two false copyright notifications on my Skyrim stream and on my Assassin's Creed
6502000	6511200	Brotherhood stream. Oh. Um, but because it's a Skamas, I can't actually counteract it without
6511200	6518320	putting like the channel at risk. So like I'm not counterclaimed or anything. Um, it just is just
6518320	6527280	a bit sucky. Um, we are eating. Okay, we've changed the tracks' pathing now, so we're gonna get back
6527280	6535680	in the mine cart and I'm gonna explore the mineshaft. Oh, I saw that horrible. Oh, sorry,
6535680	6542000	I need shields for these guys. Yeah, yeah, yeah, take that muck. Triple... Well, double kill.
6542000	6543680	Not triple, because there's not three enemies.
6552880	6556400	Okay, definitely don't want to get pooped by the bats because the bats will shove you off that
6556400	6564960	map. No hesitation. Aren't these kind of strikes automatic because someone sampled it? Yes, I just
6564960	6569920	like, I looked it up like who claimed it because it looked like it looked like nothing from Bethesda
6569920	6575120	or anything of that nature. I was like, this looks so unofficial and then I found this reddit and it
6575120	6579520	was like filled with people saying that, oh god, we're hot. I didn't actually know it was down here.
6579520	6585520	Can I just one more? Okay, good, good, good. Um, yeah, it was just filled with this reddit and
6585520	6591280	everyone was taping the same thing. Like I was just casually playing this like game. Oh no, battle arena.
6593040	6599680	Oh no, it's the spakey cane. Oh, I'm scared. Oh no, please leave me alone. Can I get the
6599680	6604800	bill? Oh my god, I'm getting demolished. I'm just gonna spam. How about that? I'll just spam.
6605760	6611600	I'll just spam. Okay, I win. I win, no. I win, I win.
6616480	6622000	Okay, we did it. We did it, we did it. I didn't know I expected a freaking battle down there.
6622640	6630160	You've got the cane of a, I am not gonna say that. This mystical rod has the power to flip
6630160	6636320	things over. Use it to charge up energy and walls and fill it out. I don't, actually wait, I think I,
6637120	6646320	I think it's Passy, like pacifist and not the other word. If you are British, you know exactly.
6646320	6652320	Hey kid, why don't you take the cane of Passy and fire it at the hole? I mean,
6652320	6654080	you never know what'll happen until you try it, right?
6657280	6660880	These people living, why are you giving me a blue portal here?
6661680	6666480	Ah, we can flip this over. Let's go!
6668720	6671200	Oh, poor Link. He's so stressed.
6673200	6677840	Strony has found the rod. Everyone run. It's too late. It's too late.
6679760	6681680	I want to make sure I hit it from the right angle though.
6682560	6686080	Ah, okay, okay, okay, okay. Right, let's just go straight back then. Super easy,
6686080	6693200	peasy, lemon, squeezy. Oh, I tell you what we could do. We're gonna go back to the start to
6693200	6699120	pick up hearts and then come right back again. There should be, hearts always regenerate like
6699120	6705120	these. Yeah, let's play it nice and safe. I actually can't remember the boss fight in this one, you know that.
6708400	6712960	I always remember the slime one because I used to get stuck as a child all the time.
6716160	6724480	Am I supposed to flip this? No, there's no main shaft, crap. Okay, I'm to do this.
6729520	6738080	Okay, okay, it's fine. It's fine, relax. Well, on earth with those spiders though, I have no idea.
6740720	6745440	Or am I too small to activate them? I think I'm too small to activate the spiders, which is good.
6746560	6751360	We don't want to do that because I think they take some health. Time to get flipped with some
6752960	6756480	What? Oh my god.
6761120	6765680	Aye, those aren't spiders anyway. I can tell you that much. Let's get out of here.
6767520	6769760	Okay, and then flip the track and then let's go.
6770720	6778880	I love his little... Oh, sorry, I walked into it.
6785520	6791680	And then we just need to do this one like that. No.
6792080	6799680	Oh, I need... Can you come here? Oh, I've done it now, haven't I?
6801680	6805600	Okay, there we go, there we go. I was like, oh, we're gonna be stuck. Let's try a wee bit.
6805600	6807440	Beyblades, yeah, those Beyblades.
6808880	6814880	A horrendous evil nasty thing. Okay, let's get this switch in order and then we can
6815760	6822800	progress. I think we're almost at the boss. I feel like we've done enough.
6837200	6841920	Am I going crazy, but I can't do that because if I push that one, it blocks it.
6842320	6849760	I'm going mental, right? Oh, because I'm not to push it at all. I understand. I understand from
6849760	6854560	the other side. Sorry. I was like, my brain was like trying its best to figure out what on earth
6854560	6861200	the game was asking for me there. I was like, pretty sure this was impossible. Yay, we're getting so
6861280	6864400	many kinstones. Right, we can go this way.
6872320	6878080	My booty. Okay, we'll need to try that again. Sorry, a bit of a panic there. Let's let the game
6879360	6881360	do its thing, do its wee cheeky beeset.
6882160	6886640	Okay, it's just the...
6890000	6892640	You are wobbling a bit too quick for Malik and...
6897520	6900800	Oh, I didn't have time to react. I need to move the pots out the way.
6902960	6909280	Okay, let's go. There was a switch back there, which I didn't do. Hold on, I need to go back.
6909280	6911040	Oh no, I can't get this switch from that side.
6914800	6919120	If you could play one on one with a recently, what game would you absolutely beat as that Black Ops
6919120	6926080	one? Absolutely no contest. Absolutely not one of you has a Black Ops one skill like me.
6927920	6935520	Absolutely no contest. No hesitation. Oh shit, is this going to break by the time we get there?
6936080	6938560	No, I don't. Thank you.
6942960	6949840	Lies, you get smoke. Oh no, you do not understand. You do not understand. When I was peak like
6951440	6958160	try hard sweat on like S&D, Team Deathmatch domination, you do not understand. You have no
6958160	6962960	comprehension. And thank you for the tip again. What the fuck am I supposed to do? Sorry, I just...
6963520	6970080	Hold on. Oh, there wasn't even anything related to things in here. Thank you for the tip again.
6970080	6977040	But no, you genuinely have no comprehension how terrible you are at the game if you go against
6977040	6986800	me on it. So right now, smile. As for any other game that I'm good at, Black Ops 2, I was pretty
6986880	6998400	decent at. I'm pretty confident the MSC, that was pretty... I bloody enjoyed that.
7004960	7010640	Can I get up? Can I get up? Yes, I can get up. On PCS, I still think I destroy on an FES.
7011280	7019040	Halo terrible, halo. Oh goodness me, where am I supposed to go? Right, follow the wind. Follow
7019040	7029120	the wind and follow the rocks. The rocks are putting me here. Oh wait, there's like... Ah,
7029120	7035840	go back, go back, go back. There's a chest here. Cancel. Wait, oh, I can't get up there. Right,
7035840	7042640	sorry, my apologies. I was diamond in Overwatch. Oh, I was terrible. Wait, I definitely cannot go
7042640	7050480	past those rocks. So let's do this. I'm not very strong at Overwatch. It was... I just never
7050480	7060160	got good at it. I just played it for fun. I like being a heal bot on Mercy. But unfortunately,
7060160	7065440	Overwatch 2 happened and I completely fell out of love with the game, which is such a shame.
7065440	7070640	But I wouldn't mind doing like a... We all play it as refling. I wouldn't mind that just casually.
7070640	7075920	And I'll be screaming at you like, God, do this. Marvel, everyone was kind of dogging on it and
7075920	7082320	yes, yes, haha, funny. But Marvel rivals, I believe the game's called, actually looked pretty decent.
7082320	7092320	So as I did, I said it, it looked decent. I got a big key. Oh, I did it! We're here! Right, we're
7092320	7098160	going to go back and fill up our health. I just realized we did it. I was too busy rambling away
7098880	7101280	that we're actually at the boss. Right, we need to try hard.
7103280	7107680	The first Overwatch 2 trailer happened. Literally, we all should have seen it come in when Papa Jeff
7107680	7114720	left because Overwatch was his baby. Okay, whoa, I'm like a pixel off of getting Mars burnt.
7115040	7126240	Whoa, ready? Ready for a boss fight? I guess these are just hearts, yeah. Oh wow, okay.
7127600	7130000	I can't remember what happens in here.
7134480	7134960	Oh no.
7138000	7138480	Whoa!
7141360	7143680	Honestly, it looks like a really cool level of Pokemon.
7145680	7148880	Oh, you can throw fire at me? That's not very nice.
7150480	7155680	Take this! Okay, I missed. I think I'm supposed to flip his arse. No, no, clearly not.
7156880	7160000	I did! You are supposed to flip his arse. Okay, okay, okay.
7162560	7169760	Tapping his horn! Okay, that's the best I can do. Ow, I just freaking hurt myself.
7170640	7175520	Uh, I don't have a lava spell to save me. Hello?
7178800	7182800	Bruh, you better calm down with that lava spread. I don't know what you want from me.
7184880	7187920	Okay, boom! Get ready. No, okay, he's not vulnerable.
7187920	7190000	Have he's vulnerable? Vulnerable? No, not yet.
7190560	7192240	Vulnerable? Yes!
7195760	7196560	With all your might!
7199840	7202480	Yes! Okay, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it.
7204800	7208480	This is all fire. Wait, oh, ow, my freaking head.
7208480	7212400	Okay, I'll take that. Yeah, this is all fire, which is not good for us,
7212400	7216480	because we need to be able to have mobility around the map, or we're in trouble.
7220480	7223600	Okay, okay, vulnerable. Okay, through your fire, that's fine.
7223600	7230720	We are too early, we are too early, we are too not in the right direction.
7231680	7237280	Nope, he's already adjusted. Stop adjusting! Bruh, that's a bit...
7237280	7240320	Bruh, I literally have no nubut, no nubut. Take that.
7242400	7243440	Okay, okay, one...
7246240	7251280	Okay, wow. I like it to teleport me on the fire, like rain between it.
7252240	7253520	Appreciate that, please don't do it again.
7255840	7256800	Oh, we did it!
7260000	7262480	Hello? Oh, I thought my game paused there, I was like,
7263360	7265920	I think we have an encounter technical difficulties.
7268560	7271040	We did it! What's the element? The fire?
7271840	7277520	Heat element? It must be heat. It must be, surely it's heat element.
7277520	7282880	You got the fire element. Flames bring light to darkness and warmth to all.
7282880	7288880	The fire element is the embodiment of that power. Fire girl confirmed for Jintu?
7291360	7296800	You got a heart container, absolutely gorgeous. I love me a heart container.
7298320	7300720	So you must get a heart container every boss you dealt with.
7301680	7306400	Oh, that was so hot, and I, it was... Oh, that was hot. It was so hot,
7306400	7309520	I thought my fibers would catch fire. Ah, but it's over now.
7309520	7311920	I suppose we should get back and speak to Malari.
7313840	7316240	Like Malari, or should I say we Malari?
7322000	7324880	Hello? Hello? Americano?
7325040	7332720	Wow, that was fast work, but not so fast that I didn't finish your sword.
7332720	7336320	Here, take a look. I call this new blade the white sword.
7336320	7338960	Well, it's green clearly by the handle, but whatever.
7340320	7344320	You got the white sword. It's, you got the white sword.
7344320	7346800	It's beautiful white blade sparkles with light.
7346800	7349120	You can put away your grandfather's sword now.
7349120	7352560	Oh, once you infuse it with the power of the elements,
7352560	7358080	it will become a sacred blade. The forest elder no doubt told you this part,
7358080	7363040	but if you want to infuse the sword, you must go to the elemental sanctuary.
7363680	7367680	The sanctuary is a strange realm, sorry I keep forgetting the voices,
7367680	7373200	trapped between two worlds. It is the bridge between the Minish world and the human world.
7374800	7379440	The doorway to the sanctuary opens only once every hundred years.
7379440	7381840	You'll find that door hidden within the castle.
7382400	7386080	Once that blade has been filled with the power of the four elements,
7386720	7390400	you should be able to break the curse of the princess,
7390400	7394640	and I know that you can do it. After all, you made short work of that human mind.
7395200	7399280	Let me tell you about a shortcut that you can get down through the mountain.
7399840	7404640	You'll find it right in front of the entrance of the mine you just explored.
7405280	7408960	You'll follow, just follow that and you'll be down in no time in the park.
7409760	7413760	Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
7416080	7418480	Thanks for making the sword, I appreciate it.
7422560	7424080	I appreciate it, love good sword moment.
7425760	7428560	Short cut through the mountain, that's in through the mountain.
7429600	7432800	Secret, secret, secret, secret, short cut.
7434000	7436080	Short cut to the bottom, a little to the right, okay.
7439200	7441440	To reflink, well no.
7443920	7446400	Short cut to the bottom, no, it's not to reflink.
7448240	7454800	To, ah, to lovers, forbidden from one another.
7454800	7463120	I mentioned divides their people, and the day didn't end.
7463120	7464560	Oh wait, I've said that wrong.
7464560	7467200	Wait, post the lyrics, post the lyrics so I can say it right.
7468160	7469920	I've messed it up, I've messed it up.
7471040	7474000	To reflink, well am I technically a reflink?
7474960	7475840	Yeah, I think so.
7477840	7480000	I love the environmental kills, they're quite sad.
7481600	7483680	Right, we need to go to the castello.
7484400	7487840	Hydration check, no, because then I have to make a cup of tea and I'll be awake.
7489120	7491280	Straining herself is the shortcut to the bottom.
7491280	7500080	Um, we got loads of stones, do you guys want to trade?
7501440	7502320	Wait, none of them?
7504800	7507280	No one wants to do kingstone pieces?
7507280	7508560	You want a fuse, yes please.
7509520	7511280	Wow, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it.
7511280	7512720	The two fit perfectly.
7513440	7519040	Two lovers, forbidden from one another.
7519040	7530480	A war divides their people, and a mountain divides them apart.
7530480	7538480	Built a path to be together, and yeah, I can never forget the next couple of lines,
7538480	7552480	and then it goes secret tunnel, secret tunnel through the mountain, secret, secret, secret tunnel.
7555680	7558640	And then everyone clapped as a mule.
7560320	7561840	I'd like to go down the stream.
7563520	7564960	Wah, chest?
7564960	7566480	Chest, yes chest.
7567200	7569680	So green is like money rewards, I guess?
7572880	7574480	Oh my god, who are you?
7577200	7578960	How can they make pixels so sexy?
7579840	7583600	We hear all sorts of interesting gossip in here.
7583600	7585840	Stop by from time to time.
7585840	7589280	Hello lady, I want a fuse canstone.
7589280	7592720	Whoa, how am I miraculously having the pieces that they want?
7597040	7601120	That looks like the cow farm, because of that little pitch on the side.
7602320	7603120	And everyone too.
7604800	7609040	She's got a mule too sharp, did they pixelate a mule on her?
7609040	7613840	No way, they freaking pixelated the milk mule, that's hilarious.
7613840	7615200	Right, what happens if I go tiny?
7616000	7618640	Please shrink me down, please shrink me down.
7621040	7624000	I have been educated, I've now learned where secret tunnel comes from.
7624000	7626560	Yes, it comes from Avatar The Last Airbender.
7626560	7628480	Did Emmy get to that episode?
7628480	7629120	I'm not sure.
7630000	7630880	She might have.
7630880	7633360	That's right, even human objects are porous in the Minish world.
7633360	7635920	These Minish may not look like much, but they are quite crafty.
7637040	7639600	Unfortunately, I think I need something to push that.
7640480	7642160	Oh hello, hi.
7643200	7646720	This cafe is so busy, you can hear all sorts of stuff from the people here.
7646720	7650080	Oh my god, their bed is a freaking take off!
7650080	7652640	Ah, I can't handle how cute this game is.
7652720	7656000	It's hard not to get stepped on when there are so many people here.
7656000	7657920	Their posters are stamps!
7659600	7661520	So cute, and look at their little light.
7661520	7662800	It's a wee globey thing.
7662800	7664160	And they got like a little baby!
7664160	7665920	Oh my god, they have baby pottery.
7665920	7667680	Look at the tiny plates and everything.
7667680	7669680	Oh my god, the floor is a menu!
7671040	7674720	Oh come on, you cannot tell me this game wasn't a passion,
7674720	7677280	a project of love from the development team.
7677280	7678080	It's so cute.
7680160	7681280	It's so kawaii.
7682080	7683440	How am I supposed to...
7683440	7684880	How am I supposed to do this?
7685680	7686400	It's so cute.
7686400	7688640	Wait, hold on a minute.
7688640	7690160	Are you squidding me right now?
7691680	7694560	Look at your avatar then asked the question again.
7695120	7696320	If you can look sexy...
7696320	7697920	It's the pixel girl can do.
7698560	7699200	Thank you.
7699920	7701440	You like my watermelon hair?
7701440	7701920	Thank you.
7702640	7704240	Thank you very much for the tip.
7704240	7705600	All right, the super chat.
7705600	7708000	Sorry, I'm not supposed to get them confused.
7708000	7710240	Wait, I want to talk to the chickadee!
7710240	7710720	Hello!
7711840	7713360	Hi, little baby.
7713360	7713760	Hello!
7714960	7715440	Eep!
7715440	7716320	One of the menace.
7716320	7716880	Peep!
7716880	7718160	I'm not like my brothers.
7718160	7720000	I won't chase you around and pick you.
7720000	7722080	Not only that, I have some good info for you.
7722080	7723840	Somewhere in Hyrule, there's a great fairy
7723840	7725600	who helps honest adventures.
7725600	7729280	If you hear her, answer her every question truthfully.
7729280	7732320	You want to chit chit use kensun?
7732320	7733520	Oh, I'm so sorry!
7733520	7737040	Oh my god, look at this fucking wee icon!
7737040	7739440	That's the cutest thing ever!
7741280	7742560	Oh my god!
7742560	7743280	I'm so sorry!
7743280	7744640	I'll come back with kensun soon.
7744640	7745920	I'm so sorry!
7745920	7746880	Go menace, sorry!
7748640	7749600	All right, what's over here?
7750160	7751360	I don't know.
7751360	7752080	There's a bush.
7755360	7757760	We can go inside this building.
7759440	7759760	Oh!
7761840	7762560	What is this?
7764800	7766080	There's construction men.
7766080	7766480	Hello!
7767760	7768880	The boss makes him rough,
7768880	7770480	but he's a real softy at heart.
7770480	7771040	Aww.
7779840	7781920	Now this kid is trying to eat stuff, though.
7781920	7782640	Hello!
7782640	7783600	Oh, you want to trade?
7783600	7784720	Yeah, let's view it.
7784720	7786080	Oh, I don't have any green.
7786640	7787600	Sorry.
7787600	7788240	Listen up.
7788240	7789200	I'm a skilled carpenter
7789200	7790400	and I'm looking for a challenge.
7791280	7792080	Uh, okay.
7792080	7792400	Hi!
7793280	7797520	I'm really quite good at tracking down rare figurines.
7798240	7798560	Okay.
7798800	7799280	Hi!
7799920	7801360	Hello, puppy!
7801360	7801680	Hello!
7805040	7805920	What is all this?
7805920	7806320	I'm busy.
7806320	7806720	Don't you see?
7806720	7808080	Do not disturb my research.
7808080	7809520	If you have no business, be gone!
7810640	7811600	Sorry, please.
7813360	7815680	Can I get any green kensun from here?
7816800	7818160	One green kensun.
7818800	7819520	One.
7819520	7820000	Fine.
7820000	7820640	I'll get a rupee.
7820640	7821120	I'll take it.
7823520	7823840	Hello!
7824640	7825040	Speak!
7826320	7828080	I collected those mysterious shells.
7828560	7830080	Ah!
7830080	7831520	I collect those mysterious shells
7831520	7833280	you've been scattered all over the place.
7833280	7834240	If you bring these shells,
7834240	7836080	I'll trade you these figurines I've made.
7836080	7837920	Ah, what is that mysterious shell?
7837920	7839520	Hmm, I've got an offer I'd like to make you.
7840160	7841840	What do you say for trading it
7841840	7843360	for a chance of winning a figurine?
7843360	7843600	Sure.
7844640	7846640	How many shells would you like to use?
7846640	7847600	The more shells you use,
7847600	7848880	the more likely to have a figurine.
7850640	7851920	Probability, 100%.
7851920	7852960	Well, I'll just use one.
7852960	7854320	You're going to trade one of them?
7854320	7854720	Great.
7854720	7857760	Now just pull the lever on the figure dispensing machine.
7858560	7859600	I will pull the lever.
7861360	7862400	Ego de...
7862400	7863200	Oh no!
7863200	7863760	Gacha!
7864880	7866160	This is gacha pawn.
7866960	7867920	Pesto.
7867920	7869760	Appears in Minish Road's dungeons.
7869760	7871280	They are red and blue ones.
7872400	7873680	The blue ones are stronger
7873680	7875120	and throw things down on your head.
7876560	7877600	Congratulations!
7877600	7879280	I'll keep the figures in this case
7879280	7880240	on the left for you.
7880240	7881600	You can see them anytime.
7881600	7882400	Oh, that's so cute!
7882400	7883360	We'll come back and do that.
7883360	7885440	I think that's going to be quite time consuming,
7885440	7886000	to be honest.
7887200	7888400	Can I have a figurine?
7888800	7891120	Or is the answer no?
7891120	7892080	Hey, I can still.
7892080	7892640	Pardon me.
7894240	7896000	I don't think I'm allowed it.
7896000	7896320	Okay.
7897040	7898000	Let's jump on this.
7899520	7901840	This is mainly a same quest for 100%.
7901840	7902480	Okay, okay.
7904480	7905600	Uh, I might...
7905600	7906160	Oh, hello!
7907120	7907680	Oh, sorry.
7907680	7908160	Am I in the way?
7908160	7908800	I just wanted to...
7908800	7910160	Anyway, it's nice of you to say hi.
7910160	7910960	Sorry for the trouble.
7910960	7911520	Move now.
7911520	7911840	Aw.
7912560	7913200	Yeah, I want to...
7913200	7914480	Aw, don't have green!
7915360	7916080	I'm sorry.
7916080	7917120	I don't have green.
7918080	7918720	Wow!
7918720	7919680	What's going on here?
7920400	7921360	Well, we can't go up,
7921360	7922320	so we can go...
7922320	7922720	Hello!
7923520	7926160	Hey, do you know the clothes that reveal the location of treasure?
7926160	7928640	Cross the bridge that spans the rapid flow
7928640	7930320	through the land of the fearsome beast
7930320	7931520	until you reach the misty falls
7931520	7933360	where treasure sleeps on the other side of this bridge?
7935600	7937040	Um, okay.
7938960	7939360	Okay.
7942640	7943360	Wait a minute.
7944320	7945200	Wait a minute.
7945840	7948160	I am getting a memory.
7951760	7953200	Oh, I can't use the stairs!
7954800	7955280	Sugar.
7957280	7957600	There's...
7957600	7959600	So, there is a push ring item.
7960640	7960880	Um...
7962720	7963040	Wow.
7964400	7965920	Okay, so the dog moves now,
7965920	7968080	so we can, like, get access to this area,
7968080	7968800	which is good.
7968800	7969520	Hi, Popper!
7969520	7970080	You okay?
7970080	7972240	Oh, he's happy now, which is good.
7972240	7976640	Wait, so why can't I get into this guy's house?
7979520	7980240	What is all this?
7980240	7980880	I'm busy.
7980880	7981920	Do not disturb my research.
7981920	7983200	If you have no business, be gone.
7986880	7987760	Excuse me, doggy.
7987760	7989040	You're still in the way.
7989040	7990000	Excuse me, doggy.
7990000	7990720	You're still in...
7990720	7991840	Excuse me, doggy.
7991840	7992640	Thank you.
7993760	7994160	Hello?
7995200	7995760	Dev team?
7996560	7997360	Okay, there.
7997360	7998000	There, jeez.
7998720	8001680	I think we have to do a library quest,
8001680	8002480	or not yet.
8004880	8006560	But, sure, I'll use Ken's stuff.
8006560	8007040	Red!
8007680	8009440	I won't even have a red one.
8010800	8011920	I'll get the ring later.
8011920	8013120	Okay, that's fine.
8013120	8014000	Right, Reeflings.
8014000	8015200	Time to feed you.
8015200	8016320	Who's hungry?
8016320	8017200	Let's get the cake.
8018400	8019120	Hello.
8019120	8019760	Welcome.
8019760	8020240	You've come.
8020880	8022800	I have a pretty tasty slice.
8023360	8024560	60 rupees!
8024560	8025760	That's a bit of a rip off, hey,
8025760	8026800	and I'm gonna be honest.
8027600	8029360	All right, we did get a Ken's stone piece, though,
8029360	8030880	and we did get a Ken's stone piece.
8030960	8032640	Is that how you farm Ken's stone pieces?
8033680	8034400	Hello?
8034400	8034800	Howdy.
8034800	8035920	Come get your fresh veggies.
8035920	8037040	They're fresher than fresh.
8038080	8039040	Straight out of the ground.
8039040	8040160	Uh, what are you?
8041680	8042720	Ah, that's unfortunate.
8042720	8043280	They're not opening it.
8043280	8044000	We'll come back later.
8044000	8044800	Okay, that's fine.
8044800	8046080	Oh, excuse me, Mr. Postman.
8046080	8046880	You're in my way.
8046880	8048160	Oh, now you're both in my way.
8048160	8049280	Oh, okay, everyone's in my way.
8049280	8049760	That's fine.
8050880	8051600	The door's shut.
8051600	8052880	We can't open it from this side.
8052880	8053360	How bizarre.
8057440	8058880	Finally, a sandwich.
8058880	8059280	Yeah.
8060240	8062400	Well, we go get some food and...
8066240	8066640	Open.
8068720	8069840	Open sesame.
8069840	8073120	Right, we can't seem to do the ring yet.
8073680	8074800	This is the ring.
8074800	8076720	Oh, there's a child in one of you.
8077280	8079040	I don't have your pace.
8079040	8081360	Stop asking for pieces that I don't have.
8082480	8083520	Don't be so selfish.
8083520	8083920	Hello?
8084800	8085760	I really wanna play a game,
8085760	8086880	but this place isn't open yet.
8086880	8088080	Guess I got here too early.
8088080	8088880	Okay, that's fine.
8088880	8089600	What's this?
8092240	8095040	Oh, wait, I can make my shield bigger?
8095840	8096880	What's for you?
8096880	8097440	What are you?
8097440	8097920	Hello?
8097920	8098480	What is this?
8099200	8101520	For only 80 rupees for a wallet.
8101520	8102560	Oh, I don't have enough.
8103360	8105680	Oh, we maybe could have had enough
8105680	8107360	if I didn't spend it on the cake.
8107360	8108160	But you know what?
8108160	8109520	I'm happy I got to treat you.
8110160	8111440	And we already got five back.
8111440	8112480	It was like an investment.
8113120	8113840	Go in here.
8113840	8114720	Go in the well.
8115280	8116080	Go in the well.
8116080	8116640	In the well.
8116640	8117280	In the well.
8118400	8118880	Exactly.
8121280	8123040	Oh, why is it giving demon noises?
8123840	8125840	Oh, I can't swim yet.
8125840	8126640	I'm not good enough.
8127440	8129520	The snakes can also steal your shield.
8130160	8131280	So you have to get it back.
8135680	8136480	That's unfortunate.
8136480	8137440	They're not open yet.
8137440	8138480	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
8138480	8140480	I'm getting the picture that nothing's open
8140480	8142160	because I'm trying to do stuff a bit too early
8142160	8143920	in the sections.
8143920	8145360	Right, let's go to the castle.
8145360	8147600	We will infuse our lovely sword.
8149680	8152160	And then we will have a quick break
8152160	8153440	and I will make a cup of tea.
8154160	8157280	So my voice doesn't shatter into a thousand different pieces.
8157280	8158320	Is there something to the right?
8159280	8160320	Oh, I've not unlocked it.
8160320	8161600	Whoa, gammy.
8162720	8164160	Gammy's aggro.
8164160	8165440	Gammy, that's not it.
8165440	8167360	Don't be aggro, gammy.
8167360	8168080	It's bad.
8168720	8169520	It's bombless.
8169840	8175520	What's over here?
8176720	8177840	I can't swim.
8177840	8180560	Whoa, he's got a bomb in his hand.
8180560	8182480	Whoa, look at the size of that waterfall.
8182480	8184560	Beautiful, simply beautiful, my boy.
8184560	8186000	I'm glad he appreciates.
8186000	8187040	All right, we can't swim.
8187040	8188960	So there's absolutely nothing we can do in this area.
8192400	8193760	Don't forget the golden snakes.
8193760	8194560	So they got money.
8194960	8200080	Oh, it's like a little minch thing here.
8201200	8205520	Oh, I'm glad I picked that up for whatever future use I mean to have for it.
8206800	8209760	I know, gammy's feeling a bit possessed right now and it's fine.
8209760	8210720	What's this?
8210720	8211600	Royal Valley.
8212720	8215120	Well, bombless since we've got full bomb anyway,
8215120	8218480	so it's probably going to be a waste of a bomb.
8221040	8222560	What the heck is this place?
8223520	8226000	Whoa, I'll take it.
8226000	8227200	A piece of part.
8227200	8228720	Oh, we've got a new heart container.
8228720	8229680	That's fantastic.
8232800	8233680	Okay, we can't swim.
8233680	8234320	We can't swim.
8234320	8234960	So it's fine.
8236000	8237200	Fantastico.
8237200	8238720	We have a new heart container.
8239280	8240560	We love tea in this house.
8244800	8245360	Just got here.
8245360	8246560	What's happened so far?
8246560	8248560	We have got the earth element.
8248560	8250240	We've just picked up the fire element
8250320	8252720	and we're about to infuse the sword.
8254400	8256080	Are you sure I look all right?
8256080	8258480	I never know what to wear for formal occasions.
8258480	8259440	My guy, you're a hat.
8261360	8266800	We basically just need to go under the castle to find the secret room.
8269440	8273280	And then we can learn a new technique from the sword master.
8274800	8276080	But yeah, very beautiful.
8276960	8279200	Link, look, see that doorway goes?
8279840	8282240	Could that be the door that leads to the sanctuary?
8282240	8284240	Nobody in this castle seems to be able to see it,
8284240	8285200	but you and me.
8285200	8286080	Let's go quickly.
8287440	8289440	It's elemental sanctuary.
8290480	8291920	Wow, the music, the music.
8292720	8293760	The music, please.
8298560	8298960	Wow.
8304800	8306000	Okay, there it is.
8306800	8307920	Hmm.
8307920	8310320	So this is the elemental sanctuary then.
8310320	8313360	This is where we can infuse your blade with the power of the elements.
8313360	8316400	Yes, that seems to be the pedestal for it.
8316400	8317520	Let's shove it in.
8319040	8319280	Bump.
8321760	8322880	There we go.
8322880	8324240	Two element and some fears.
8325600	8326640	We're doing it.
8330640	8331520	It's perfect.
8332480	8336880	It glows.
8340400	8345120	The powers of earthen fire elements have infused your blade.
8352240	8355600	Let's see if I can read that tablet for you.
8355600	8358960	Fill your sword with the power and walk over the glowing tail.
8359520	8362880	Perhaps it refers to those flashing spots on the floor around you.
8362880	8364320	Well, what are you waiting for?
8364320	8365040	Try it, Link.
8367920	8368880	Oh, not yet.
8370880	8371600	There's two of us.
8373760	8375200	You just split in two.
8375200	8377200	So this is the power of the white sword?
8377760	8379520	I guess you can double yourself like that
8379520	8381040	anytime when you see those panels.
8383440	8387200	Okay, now we have a few more abilities, which is good.
8389360	8394720	Um, there was a few things back the way that we did overlook.
8394720	8396480	We're going to go back and hit the town
8396480	8400080	because I want to learn what the master possession will teach us.
8401600	8404240	Um, right, we'll run back into town
8404240	8406640	and then we'll run and get snacks and go for a pee.
8407440	8407840	Okay.
8409440	8410240	What dungeon?
8410240	8411600	This is the Castello.
8412240	8414240	We're getting the elements infused
8414240	8416000	and we're about to go for the third element.
8416080	8419280	Oh, wait, there's a snake to the right, isn't there?
8420320	8422560	Oh, I can't get access to it because of the guards.
8423200	8423680	I don't know.
8424560	8425440	I tried.
8425440	8426480	Um, oh!
8429680	8430480	Oh, they're English.
8430480	8431680	Wait, what's an English voice?
8432400	8433280	Interesting.
8433280	8436080	You're the last person I expected to find here
8436080	8438960	and just as I was wondering who could be behind this,
8438960	8441200	I find my old master.
8446640	8447140	Wow.
8449040	8449540	Vati!
8451120	8455920	Oh, and as always, you are dressed in the shabbiest of rags.
8456560	8458720	My curses are not to be mocked.
8458720	8461440	The one I cast on you is the most powerful.
8461440	8465600	No matter what power you wield, you will never break it.
8469040	8471520	You have me changed in the slightest, yabam.
8472080	8474240	I should never have created that cap.
8474240	8476480	It only fueled your insane desires.
8477280	8479760	Thank you for becoming a member, Sortar.
8479760	8481040	Sortar B'lain.
8483200	8483680	Fool.
8484480	8487360	A hat that grants the wishes of its wearer
8487360	8489600	as a spectacular creation.
8489600	8492720	Thanks to you, I have gone from being a meek miniscule,
8492720	8496080	nothing to the greatest sorcerer alive.
8496800	8500560	You cannot stop me now and I have you to thank for it.
8500560	8503600	Accept the small gesture of gratitude from me.
8504960	8508320	Wait, Vati, wait, you fucking bam.
8509600	8510080	Oh, yeah.
8510640	8511200	Oh, yeah.
8511200	8511920	Oh, yeah, bitch!
8513360	8516000	I'm just sp- I'm just spamming, I'm just spamming.
8517600	8518480	Okay, it's not that bad.
8518480	8519120	It's not that bad.
8521600	8522320	Okay, we're fine.
8522320	8524240	I wasn't as bad as I anticipated.
8524240	8525600	That foul Vati.
8525600	8526400	What could he be?
8526400	8526880	He?
8530080	8530880	He?
8530880	8531680	Question mark.
8534480	8534800	He?
8535680	8536720	Is it not a lady?
8537840	8539440	What could he be scheming now?
8540080	8544240	Link, I feel I owe you an explanation for what just happened.
8544240	8547040	You see, Vati and I are actually both menish.
8547680	8551920	I was once a famous sage and a renowned menish craftsman.
8551920	8553280	Vati was only a boy.
8553280	8554480	Okay, it's definitely a guy.
8555200	8558320	Vati was only a boy when it took him in as my apprentice,
8558320	8562480	but he became enchanted by the wickedness in the hearts of men.
8562560	8565120	One day, Vati took a hat I made for the humans.
8565120	8566480	My pride and joy.
8566480	8568400	It granted the wishes of its wearer.
8568400	8570240	He put it on without my permission, though.
8571360	8572880	Am I going to flashback?
8572880	8574240	Okay, it's a guy.
8576080	8577440	I thought Vati was a chick.
8578880	8580640	Vati, what are you doing here?
8581360	8582400	Oh my god, that's her hat.
8585440	8586160	Oh, yeah.
8588320	8591120	Oh, what a vile form you've taken.
8592720	8596000	Vio, I can't do an English male voice.
8596800	8599040	I need to sound like Phil from EastEnders.
8599040	8601360	Vio, I am a sorcerer now,
8601360	8603760	and my power is beyond compare.
8603760	8607120	No longer will I tire away as your apprentice.
8607120	8609760	Now, all shall call me master.
8611360	8613520	Wait, Vati, what are you plotting?
8614720	8617040	This year, on the day that comes,
8617040	8620640	but once a century, the portal opens.
8620640	8624720	And when it does, I shall claim the life force as my own.
8624720	8627200	I will be transformed, perfect,
8627200	8629360	and there will be none who can stop me.
8639520	8642400	Oh no, so that's who we have.
8642960	8647760	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
8647760	8651840	Tell me, how does it feel, why sorcerers kiss?
8651840	8653760	Do you see, Eslo?
8653760	8655840	I am truly your master now.
8655840	8659520	You cannot stop me, and with that, I must believe it.
8663200	8664560	And that's how Eslo came to be.
8665200	8666880	You know the legends, of course.
8667520	8670160	The gift the Pokori gave the humans.
8670160	8673200	What you call the Pokori Blade was the first of these gifts.
8673200	8676000	The second, well, you call it the light force,
8676000	8678720	but it is the source of limitless magic, power.
8679440	8683360	If Vati were to be able to get it now, it would be devastating.
8684320	8687760	I came to the world of men, hoping to stop Vati,
8687760	8689280	and I came to you in the woods.
8690560	8691360	You did want that?
8691920	8695200	But it seems we won't be breaking the curse any time soon.
8695200	8697040	However, with the Sacred Blade,
8697040	8699600	we can certainly restore the Princess Zelda.
8700240	8705600	I'm sorry, all that has happened has been due to my pride, my folly.
8705600	8710000	I must rely on you, on your power, until we put an end to Vati.
8712320	8712820	Monk.
8714960	8717920	Well, Link, enough fairy tales.
8717920	8720000	We must search for the next element.
8723840	8724720	I don't know where to go.
8726320	8728960	Right, we'll go into town, and then I'll have a little break,
8728960	8731200	and I'll go make a tea, okay?
8731200	8733440	And you guys can stretch your...
8733440	8733940	No.
8736080	8739520	Your legs to prevent any issues with your penis.
8739520	8740020	Okay.
8741520	8742160	Sorry.
8742160	8743520	Set that the wrong way around.
8743520	8746000	You're to stretch your legs so you don't have any issues.
8746000	8748800	I will leave the game running in the background,
8748800	8750880	whilst I go get my Koopa save.
8752240	8753200	Already lost.
8753200	8754720	We didn't even get started.
8756160	8757440	Stretch the tentacle.
8758320	8761280	Right, I'll leave the game so you guys can appreciate the music
8761280	8761920	for what it's worth.
8761920	8763520	This game is very adorable.
8763520	8765200	We are already two elements.
8765200	8766800	We are about to go for the third.
8768080	8770560	If I'm not mistaken, the shoe shop should be open,
8770560	8772640	because I've just remembered where we're heading next.
8773760	8776240	Please do grab a snack, get some hydration,
8776240	8777600	do go for a tinkle as well.
8777600	8779200	It's not good to hold in your bladder.
8779200	8780720	The only reason I don't need to pee a lot
8780720	8783600	is because I am severely dehydrated.
8783600	8784320	Let's go.
8784320	8785920	We love severely dehydrated.
8785920	8787680	I mean, you never have to go for breaks.
8789520	8791200	But yes, get some snacks.
8791200	8792080	I will get some too.
8792080	8793360	I will be a couple of minutes,
8793360	8794720	but I shan't be long.
8794720	8795760	Okay, I shan't be long.
8797360	8798800	T-minus warning for
8800560	8800960	Emi?
8802080	8802960	Question mark?
8802960	8805200	Emi coming on in one hour 20?
8805200	8806160	Question mark?
8806160	8806800	I think.
8806800	8807440	I'm not sure.
8810320	8811600	I should be able to redirect,
8811600	8813280	whichever issue it is.
8813280	8814880	I can't remember what game you're playing, Emi.
8814880	8816960	I know you've got a collab this week on...
8817920	8818800	No, don't talk.
8818800	8819680	Nobody explodes.
8822880	8824080	Yes, I'll be back in a moment.
8824080	8825440	Give me a few minutes, okay?
8964880	8967120	Are you squinting me right now?

9407360	9409360	Give me future
9409360	9411360	Give me future
9411360	9413360	You are too f**king thrown in a border
9413360	9415360	Where my god?
9415360	9417360	Gimli and Beato came flying around the corner
9417360	9421360	I was like ooo
9421360	9423360	I may or may not have forgotten to feed them this morning
9423360	9425360	Eps
9425360	9426400	Have back
9426400	9428400	Have back
9428400	9431720	So, I'm eating leftovers, and I was like,
9431720	9433680	hurry, hurry, hurry, the ruffles are waiting,
9433680	9436320	the ruffles are waiting, and I was pouring cheese,
9436320	9438000	like a wee bit of grated cheese on it,
9438000	9440040	the entire bag fell out on the meal,
9440040	9442280	and I'm like, are you effing kidding me right now?
9442280	9445160	Like the kettle's boiling, cats are body-me-amming.
9446240	9447680	I'm like, oh my god, the poor ruffles
9447680	9449880	are just sitting on this freaking title screen.
9451920	9453800	I didn't understand a single word by a gray,
9453800	9455560	thank you, thank you for agreeing.
9455560	9457600	Right, I'm saying something like that too.
9458720	9462640	Okay, T minus one hour 30,
9462640	9465760	and then part one of Minish Cap is complete.
9467560	9469920	I do have a warm, I've actually got a cola.
9472760	9475960	Love me cola, I do, I do.
9475960	9478800	I was so scared, well, because I was away.
9481600	9484000	Right, we need to check out the shoe shop,
9484000	9486480	because I believe this is where we're heading next.
9486480	9490960	Yes, hello, was that, oh, welcome,
9490960	9493280	welcome to Rem's shoe shop.
9493280	9494880	Lately, whenever I take a nap,
9494880	9496360	all my shoes are done when I wake up,
9496360	9498520	you know, if I can make shoes in my sleep,
9498520	9500400	I must be in the right job.
9500400	9504400	However, things are not as it seems, no, no, no.
9506360	9510120	We're gonna take out, oh yeah, piss.
9510120	9511800	Yeah, I can't reach it.
9511800	9514360	Okay, 70 AM cola, literally.
9517480	9520160	Actually, I can't believe I'm saying this.
9520160	9523280	I have to actually work after I finish the stream.
9523280	9524520	Well, the other stream as well.
9524520	9525880	Wait, is everything open now?
9525880	9526720	No.
9528320	9529400	Okay, it's not open.
9531520	9535640	Oh, right, is the library open now?
9535640	9536800	Question mark.
9538520	9540080	No, that's the school.
9540080	9541400	No, it's not open.
9542360	9547200	There's a little mini-pot up there, oh yeah.
9550080	9553800	Am I supposed to go down and discover the swamp
9553800	9556360	and then come back to the town, possibly?
9557840	9559320	Very probable.
9559320	9561120	So you don't consider streaming work.
9562120	9563720	This ain't work.
9563720	9566240	I thought this ain't work.
9567200	9568040	This is not work.
9568120	9570160	I absolutely, hello.
9570160	9572160	Oh, hello, my brother's at school, okay.
9573680	9577320	Failed the bench delt test or whatever the freaking thing is.
9577320	9580320	I can't remember what it was, but I was laughing my ass off
9580320	9583400	because Lord of the Rings fails the bench delt test.
9586720	9589160	And I was like, oh, it's still a good movie, who cares?
9590440	9593120	I was like, where the heck am I supposed to do it?
9593120	9594640	Right, I think we're just to go to the swamp
9594640	9596920	and discover that we can walk in.
9596920	9599880	The bench delt test, it's like a test
9599880	9604880	and it's like, if two lambs speak to each other,
9605360	9608560	but it's not about a man, then it passes.
9609400	9611400	And it seems like such a small thing,
9611400	9614000	but it never happens in movies
9614000	9616920	because obviously movies have to be centered around the plot.
9616920	9619720	Right, I guess I have to go all the way up and into the thing.
9621640	9623680	So it's quite humorous.
9623680	9625400	Don't take it too seriously.
9625440	9627640	People don't really take it too seriously.
9627640	9630200	It's fucking relax, it's not that serious.
9630200	9632760	Two named women characters talk to each other
9632760	9633800	something other than that.
9633800	9636280	Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like something funny like that.
9636280	9639760	And it's like, a lot of things fail it, which is hilarious.
9641080	9644000	Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, double drop.
9644000	9646760	Hello, is the game feeling nice?
9646760	9648360	Is there like more under here?
9649640	9652040	I'll start picking these up if I get a piece.
9653040	9656880	Is the game feeling bad for not giving me them?
9656880	9658480	Good, because it should feel bad.
9660480	9662240	Mummy, can we do a Lord of the Rings watch long?
9662240	9666000	Yes, you're actually doing it with me
9666000	9668280	on Christmas Day and Boxing Day.
9668280	9669640	We're doing Lord of the Rings first,
9669640	9671280	and then we're doing the Hobbit.
9672560	9676160	Just because I am aware that
9676160	9679520	Crumble Time can be a bit sore, a bit not fun.
9679520	9681360	Whoa, blue.
9681360	9684520	Whoa, you got those guys.
9684520	9687680	Wait, I'm cutting the grass, I'm cutting the grass.
9687680	9689040	Oh my God, oh my God,
9689040	9691600	the game's feeling so nice right now, what the heck?
9691600	9693040	I'm cutting the grass, I'm cutting the grass.
9693040	9695200	Hold on, let me cut the grass.
9695200	9698200	You don't understand, I need to cut all the grass right now.
9698200	9699600	I'll grab that shell though.
9701040	9702920	And we're getting money for doing it too.
9702920	9704160	I wasn't kidding when this,
9704160	9706400	this is literally grass cut simulator.
9708000	9710280	Oh my God, there's so many.
9710280	9713640	Hold on, we might actually have to go back to town
9713640	9715600	if it's given me that much.
9720400	9721920	What's in here?
9721920	9725240	A red piece, oh, someone wanted to trade us a red piece.
9725240	9727880	Oh no, but I can't remember the location.
9729840	9734840	Hey, it's me, it's the two-year reefing badge, no it's not.
9735040	9737600	Oh right, cause it's a, sorry, sorry, I was like,
9738440	9741320	I was like, that is impossible,
9741320	9743080	unless we've got time traveling here.
9744280	9745640	We're cutting the grass.
9745640	9748440	I assume if it stops giving us stones,
9748440	9751480	then it stops, right, what's in here?
9752720	9755520	Oh hello, hello, I am Percy,
9755520	9758120	poet literature of Hyrule,
9758120	9759920	and you are Link, sorry I skip that.
9759920	9761400	I travel all over the realm,
9761400	9763360	writing verses wherever I go,
9763360	9765720	but here I am, returning after a long absence,
9765720	9767760	only to find the road blocked.
9767760	9769320	It wouldn't feel like such a waste
9769320	9771680	if I hadn't lost half of my kinstone,
9771680	9773640	where misfortune rains down upon my head
9773640	9774960	at pores and torrents.
9774960	9776800	I think I may have dropped it in the inn
9776800	9778680	I stayed in last night.
9778680	9780280	I see no other course than to put
9780280	9782200	these tragic events to verse.
9782200	9784040	I see stars beyond the rainbow,
9784040	9785920	but I cannot reach them.
9785920	9788200	Through the stone, though the stone out,
9788200	9792120	I lost a small, large wizards placing my heart.
9792120	9795040	Okay, I need to go back to the inn.
9795760	9798320	Is that why it's giving me all these kinstone pieces?
9800200	9803280	Ah, looks like my drop rate's changed,
9803280	9806480	so I think I might have to go trade people.
9809320	9811600	Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.
9811600	9812920	Oh, sorry.
9812920	9815680	Sorry, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, pal.
9816880	9819240	Right, we're gonna unlock this route,
9819240	9821920	because that's literally in my way, it's in my way,
9821920	9822920	it's in my way.
9823920	9825640	Please, I need to pick up.
9825640	9826960	Maybe there's a hidden thing.
9826960	9830200	No, it was an old man.
9831640	9833880	All right, drop rate is definitely changed.
9835560	9839040	Oh, oh, we've got a little cutscene moment.
9839040	9840760	Eh, what a strange feeling.
9840760	9843440	I sense something from the castle's direction,
9843440	9844680	or was it just me?
9844680	9846640	Oh, we need to go back to the castle?
9847640	9852600	Oh, Phil from EastEnders, right, let's go.
9856080	9858160	Oh, who's there?
9859320	9862120	Eh, Vati, how did you get in here?
9863120	9865280	I don't know how to do an English voice.
9866960	9869440	Monka, instead of walking the teleport,
9869440	9870920	talk about being lazy.
9871920	9874000	Uh, what are you doing?
9874920	9878960	Eh, given that sloppy toppy, clearly.
9878960	9879800	Jesus.
9881320	9882400	What did he do?
9882400	9883240	Eh?
9885840	9888200	Oh, he infected the...
9888200	9889600	It looks like you're all here.
9889600	9892680	Very well, the king of Hyrule has words for you.
9892680	9895120	You all know the power of the Pokora gave to mankind,
9895120	9895960	do you not?
9895960	9898480	The golden light force of limitless magical power.
9898480	9900280	I want it, it's somewhere here in Hyrule,
9900280	9902040	go now and bring me this power.
9903040	9906640	Waste no time, go forth at once and bring me the light force.
9906640	9910960	Oh no, Vati made the king go crazy.
9910960	9913520	Fling anyone who refuses into the dungeon,
9913520	9915520	him and his family too, oh, North Korea.
9915520	9917600	I will tolerate no disobedience,
9917600	9920360	now search high and low throughout the lands of Hyrule.
9922360	9923440	What do they think?
9923440	9927200	Maybe it's just the wind, but I hope nothing bad has happened.
9927200	9929840	Anyway, we need to look for the next element.
9929840	9931920	The map says it should be around here somewhere.
9932000	9933840	Yes, it must be around here.
9933840	9935160	Pinstone pieces?
9935160	9936000	Nope.
9937160	9941120	Gami is getting poised to attack me and see...
9941120	9942800	Did they just keep flying or did they go...
9942800	9945640	Whoa, you don't even have to do anything to them?
9948360	9949960	Hold on, that's money.
9949960	9952800	Oh wait, I can get a new wallet if I get 80.
9952800	9954800	Hold on, let's see if I can get 80 coins,
9954800	9956600	that might go down quite well.
9957840	9960560	Okay, we're gonna go get a new wallet and trade the people,
9960560	9964240	because there was quite a few trades that I couldn't do.
9965360	9967560	Well, I think I'm not...
9967560	9968640	He's really unruly.
9970480	9972040	So the light force is some kind of treasure,
9972040	9974840	I can get anywhere, the king must be looking for it.
9974840	9975680	Right, not you.
9976600	9977760	You?
9977760	9978600	You.
9980120	9981200	Yes.
9981200	9983240	Can I have this one please?
9983240	9985040	Two pinstones, but carefully together.
9985040	9987040	Hold on, I'm gonna bring my food over
9987040	9989120	because I don't want it to get too cold.
9989120	9991920	Whoa, chest, just a chest, okay, that's fine.
9993400	9996560	Okay, I'm mixing in my stupendous amount of cheese
9996560	9998680	for the pasta, hold here.
9998680	9999680	It's not looking good.
10000960	10003680	Hey, they fit perfectly, I wonder what's gonna happen.
10003680	10004880	I get a chest.
10004880	10006080	Do you trade me?
10006080	10006920	No, you're done.
10006920	10007760	How about you?
10007760	10009280	Everyone still relies here, it's a good thing.
10009280	10012240	My ideal cafe is a place where everyone can just hang out, yeah.
10012240	10013080	How about you?
10014000	10015200	You wanna fuse pinstone?
10015200	10016040	Yeah!
10019200	10020680	Like a four-leaf clover,
10020680	10022680	where did you end up meeting a spaghetti?
10024120	10025120	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
10031560	10033640	That wasn't what we needed.
10035080	10036320	When he said N,
10038720	10040320	oh, the postman!
10040320	10044160	Oh, wait, wait, I'm not a Mr. Postman.
10044160	10048160	Baby, I'm a Mr. Postman.
10048160	10049000	Oh!
10049720	10050560	What's this?
10054920	10056800	I really wish I could do more to help people.
10056800	10059120	Wait, I've got it, I'll ask swiftly
10059120	10061480	to start up a newsletter for adventures.
10061480	10063320	That'll be a great way to create a useful service
10063320	10064320	for everyone, hmm.
10064320	10065600	It's going to be a lot of work though.
10065600	10067680	I should get Marcy to help me.
10069320	10070160	Marcy?
10071400	10073040	Help, a fish quiz.
10074040	10079040	I have no, I don't have no recollection.
10080760	10082960	Whoa, there's a new guy in town.
10084880	10086280	We've got so much fusing.
10088200	10089640	Hey, did you talk to your mage?
10091520	10093880	Oh, is a Wind Waker reference?
10093880	10095560	I don't know.
10095560	10096720	Another chess, okay.
10100600	10101440	Delicious.
10102440	10103680	I'm nutritious.
10105480	10108040	Hey, they fit perfectly, this will be good.
10108040	10109800	Hello, what do you sell?
10111240	10112640	Why, hello there, thanks for coming by.
10112640	10115320	I sell all kinds of pickle, like,
10115320	10117120	I just put in your bottle and get some patterns
10117120	10118040	when you drink it.
10118040	10121120	Hmm, I only drink stuff that reeflings give me,
10121120	10123160	if I'm gonna be honest.
10123160	10125120	Oh no, I don't have it, ugh.
10126880	10128880	Um, no, there was.
10129720	10130560	Oh man.
10133560	10136880	Ah, I don't have it, it's not that red piece, draught.
10138160	10139480	Ah, not you.
10140360	10143120	There was someone here that wanted to,
10143120	10145160	oh, I just put a bomb down in front of this guy's house.
10145160	10146640	Sorry mate, it didn't mean that.
10146640	10149280	Ah, do apologize, don't have it either.
10150680	10152480	It's not a change of heart.
10153480	10155960	I'm just committing war crimes, okay, geez.
10159040	10160640	Oh, can I fuse you?
10160640	10161640	No.
10161640	10163320	Oh wait, did I go back to the sword master?
10163320	10164520	Can I, was it you?
10165680	10167680	Well, I can fuse with them, so I'll take it.
10169520	10172400	Oh, the money bag, yes, sorry, I already forgot, geez.
10173720	10175600	Hmm, I'll grab that now.
10177440	10178960	Ooh, what's this, quite nice.
10181600	10182440	A chest.
10189000	10192240	Oh, oh, move on, move on, move on, move on.
10192240	10193680	They fit perfectly, time to celebrate.
10193680	10196040	I don't think these guys can do anything for me.
10196040	10198640	Right, we'll go get the,
10198640	10200280	sorry, I'm playing one handed right now,
10200280	10201960	I would go faster if I'm eating.
10205160	10207760	I'm trying to eat and progress the story at the same time.
10208600	10212240	Um, right, first get the rupee bag,
10213320	10216000	because then we can hold more rupees in general.
10216000	10217320	No, not that one.
10217320	10218160	No.
10219640	10223440	Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
10223440	10225240	Hello, may I please have this?
10226520	10228320	Only 80 rupees for a wallet,
10228320	10231760	it can hold a king's ransom by, yes.
10233320	10235720	Yo, now you can carry more rupees, perfect.
10235720	10237400	Much obliged, my good lad.
10238520	10241920	Much obliged, I have more, I do have more.
10241920	10245360	Whoa, I didn't realize you could even go and see
10245640	10246760	inside the bag.
10246760	10249960	The reason why I'm asking if I have water is this.
10252240	10254120	Literally, you'd never figure it out on your own,
10254120	10255120	it's impossible.
10257240	10258080	Do you want to trade?
10258080	10260560	My dog's real smart and a little spoiled too.
10260560	10262880	Aw, that's what you're supposed to do.
10262880	10264800	You're supposed to, let's go talk to the dog.
10264800	10268400	Hello, oh, you want to, the dog has a fricking,
10268400	10270520	aw, it's always the one I don't have.
10272840	10274440	Some might even take a swipe at you.
10274440	10276240	Okay, this dog's nice.
10276240	10277800	Oh, God.
10277800	10279920	See, this is why you're supposed to go like that.
10279920	10281200	Wait.
10281200	10282800	Oh, no.
10282800	10284440	Whoa, did you see that cat looking at me?
10284440	10285920	I know it wants a piece of me.
10286920	10289800	This is for a later quest, which we're not on right now
10289800	10292040	because I'm going too far ahead of the plot.
10292880	10293720	Oops.
10294720	10296120	He's a good boy.
10297040	10298360	Just like a replay.
10299800	10302360	You're such a good doggy replay, you're the one.
10303360	10305640	Can I go in now?
10305640	10306680	Finally.
10306680	10310800	Right, I'm to trade someone in the end.
10312400	10313640	Must be upstairs.
10319840	10320840	Is it you?
10322560	10325720	And you asked for the one I don't have.
10325720	10327160	Is it one of the children?
10328240	10330600	Stop asking for the ones I don't have.
10331480	10332320	Right now.
10335560	10336760	What's going to happen?
10336760	10338960	I need to inhale my food, it's getting cold.
10342400	10344160	Okay, that's a later platform.
10349680	10351440	Okay, is that...
10351440	10352280	Oh, you?
10354760	10356120	Okay, can do it, can do it.
10356120	10357320	I'm gonna have to go in the grass
10357320	10359240	and look for more pinstone.
10361600	10362440	Hmm.
10365160	10366280	A chest again?
10366280	10368440	Okay, it looks like green is all chest.
10369520	10370360	Oh, wait.
10372200	10375360	Some sort of monetary gain as I choke on my food.
10376280	10377120	Gah.
10377920	10379800	Okay, can't go out there yet
10379800	10381400	because we don't have a light, which is fine.
10381400	10383120	Is there anyone in here?
10383120	10384360	No, there's not, okay.
10385400	10387480	Right, we need to go get pinstones
10387480	10389400	so we can unlock this next section.
10391600	10393880	Because we can't frickin' progress.
10397480	10399320	I'm even sure what to do.
10399320	10401800	I'm pretty sure there's a tingle man down here.
10404840	10405680	What?
10405680	10406520	Yeah, there he is.
10407960	10409640	Let's go see this tingle man.
10409640	10410880	Hello, tingle man.
10410880	10412880	Yeah, I wanna fuse pinstone.
10412880	10415040	And do you want the one I actually have?
10415040	10416280	I like it here.
10416280	10417480	I'm like maneuver.
10419200	10420040	Oh.
10421440	10422280	Oh.
10423840	10425920	Okay, we'll definitely go investigate that
10425920	10426920	because that's cool.
10428920	10429920	They fit perfectly.
10429920	10430760	Thank you.
10433320	10436120	Right, we're gonna go get this.
10436120	10436960	What is it?
10436960	10438720	200 shells.
10438720	10440800	I better not be full with shells.
10440800	10441640	No, I'm not.
10441640	10442480	That's fine.
10442480	10444280	I don't wanna waste shells.
10444280	10445360	I'd rather go gamble.
10446320	10447640	Yes!
10447640	10448480	Right, okay.
10448480	10450120	I guess I'm just not allowed to have
10450120	10451680	a certain amount on my person
10451680	10453520	or the game is like that's too many
10453520	10455640	and not fun anymore.
10456880	10458800	Grass cutting simulator.
10458800	10461160	Grass cutting simulator.
10461160	10463960	Simulator, grass cutting simulator.
10465920	10469440	I don't wanna go back to the guy with only one.
10469440	10470880	That's so small.
10472840	10473840	That's so little.
10475280	10476440	What's over here?
10478960	10480720	Oh, we don't have access to it yet.
10485040	10487920	Did I go as far as I could back then?
10490520	10493080	Or am I gonna have to go to that area?
10493080	10494360	Just to cut grass.
10494360	10496960	Literally making my way over there just to cut grass.
10501120	10502440	Dingle, dingle, dingle.
10505160	10507920	Am I going extra crazy?
10507960	10509760	Oh my God, I'm going extra crazy.
10510600	10511960	This is where I'm supposed to go.
10511960	10513320	I don't need to do anything.
10516000	10517600	Ah!
10517600	10518440	Strat.
10519320	10520160	This is it.
10521160	10522600	So, this must be, sorry,
10522600	10525120	I'm burning myself with my whole war ball right now.
10525120	10526880	So this must be Caster Wilds.
10526880	10531880	It's a nasty dank place filled with swamp land and mirror.
10532200	10533840	Mirror, mire?
10533840	10536440	But we know there's an element waiting for us.
10536440	10537920	Come on, Link, let's go.
10544720	10547640	I don't think we can walk fast enough to cross the swamp.
10547640	10550400	We're gonna have to find some way to get across safely.
10550400	10553080	Okay, I think now that we've done that,
10553080	10556760	it means we can go to the shoe shop guy again.
10557720	10562480	Kingstone can be grander than RuneScape, honestly?
10562480	10566360	Right, now the shoe shop guy will entertain us.
10566400	10569880	Or the event will occur, like, that's supposed to happen.
10569880	10571200	Oh!
10571200	10573240	They dropped 20!
10573240	10575120	Parish right now, give me more money.
10577560	10578880	So then what was down here?
10582720	10583640	Did I just get to be?
10583640	10586640	I don't think I can go any further when I can.
10593080	10594920	Kingstone, kingstone, kingstone.
10595520	10596360	Is that?
10599080	10600000	Am I losing it?
10600000	10600840	Am I losing it?
10600840	10603960	Did I just think I couldn't go any further when I could?
10603960	10605400	Oh, my guys.
10605400	10607160	I'm not gonna make it.
10607160	10608600	Hello?
10608600	10609800	I planted it being near my house,
10609800	10611280	but it just doesn't seem to grow.
10611280	10614360	No, it won't, because I need to kingstone it.
10615360	10616520	Wow.
10616520	10618280	The mysterious shells are worse.
10620360	10622200	I'm almost there.
10622200	10624680	Doomsday, Dan, thank you for the tip.
10624680	10626400	You didn't put a message though.
10626400	10627400	Find and read out.
10628720	10630920	And delay lover, I don't think I said your name again.
10630920	10632360	Delay lover, be a lure.
10632360	10633920	I'll figure you identify yourself.
10637320	10638320	I'm almost there now.
10639400	10642160	You're gonna have to put up with my tune, okay?
10642160	10643000	I can't.
10644480	10645960	I can't do everything.
10645960	10646800	I don't know.
10650600	10651920	I just don't know.
10655320	10656320	You didn't go any further.
10656320	10657480	Just assumed you couldn't.
10657480	10659320	Oh, my God.
10659320	10660960	Talk about giving up, Mentale.
10663840	10664680	Wow.
10666400	10667600	Oh, it's like choke.
10668600	10671160	I'm swallowing, I'm swallowing, I'm choking, I'm choking.
10674160	10675000	You want a bite too?
10675000	10676080	You most certainly can have a bite.
10676080	10677640	Go, ah.
10677640	10679360	Here comes the airplane.
10684960	10687120	I've always done any itch, my eyelash.
10687120	10689680	It's always on my left eye, my first eyelash.
10695760	10696600	That's four.
10698400	10699560	All the food is gone.
10702280	10704640	We will now go back to the shoemaker
10704640	10708920	because we need the shoemaker in order to progress.
10708920	10710280	Oh, ow.
10710280	10712160	My butt, I was looking at chat
10712160	10714760	and that gammy sniped my butt.
10717720	10719280	Delicious, delicious, delicious.
10719280	10720680	Goodbye.
10720680	10721520	No.
10723960	10726920	Chewing the mic and you shall be forgiven.
10726920	10728520	No, people hate that.
10728520	10732120	It's like, there's something called like misophobia
10732120	10732960	or something.
10735800	10737360	Oh, here it is, this is the event.
10737360	10739080	Okay, we're doing it, we're doing it.
10743160	10746880	Oh, sleepy little, oh, yeah, I worked in too hard.
10748200	10749360	There we go.
10751000	10752240	Hello, hi.
10753600	10755280	Hey, hey, you're Link, right?
10755280	10758720	You're the one who brought the sword to Master Merlari.
10758720	10761480	You're on a quest to help the princess, aren't you?
10761480	10762760	I wish I could go on a quest,
10762760	10764760	but then who'd make Rem's shoes for him?
10764760	10767080	Notice how he's called Rem as in Rem's sleep.
10769000	10771760	Like that one beach it better from.
10771840	10775000	V4, Rem, yeah, Rem, get it.
10776280	10778080	Hey ho, is that Pegasus boots?
10778080	10780000	We just made a pair while Rem was sleeping,
10780000	10782840	but only Rem can put the finishing touches on them.
10782840	10784360	Ha ha, that sleepy head.
10784360	10785960	Rem is nearly impossible to wake up.
10785960	10786880	If you wanna wake him up,
10786880	10789320	you'll need to get an item from Syrups Hop.
10790360	10792080	It's a little bit of a trek,
10792080	10794920	but we'll mark it on the map for you.
10796480	10800840	So now we need to go up into the right.
10801880	10806680	Um, oh, I feel freaking detailed all this is.
10806680	10808160	Who is Rem?
10808160	10812440	From the other VTuber agency for V-Reverie.
10812440	10814280	I can, no, not reverie.
10814280	10815880	Not reverie, hold on a minute.
10815880	10817080	Not that one.
10817080	10820200	It's like V4 Mariaeus.
10820200	10824160	There, V4-Me-E-Ret-Ail.
10824160	10825360	Look, I'm gonna be honest,
10825360	10827160	I don't know how on earth to say it.
10828120	10830360	You guys are gonna have to spell it out for me
10830360	10832840	if you want me to say the name of that agency properly,
10832840	10834680	cause I ain't got a chance.
10834680	10835800	I ain't got a chance.
10836760	10837600	Okay.
10840400	10842600	My-Rae.
10842600	10844640	My-Me-Rae?
10845560	10846680	Mer-Rae.
10850240	10852160	V4 Mer-Rae.
10854360	10856440	It was supposed to be a V0 though.
10857440	10860320	It said like, me-er-ae.
10861920	10862960	Me-er-ae.
10862960	10864520	Me-er-ae.
10864520	10865840	Me-er-ae.
10865840	10866680	Hello?
10866680	10867520	Oh, what's wrong?
10867520	10869400	You wanna fuse Kinstone?
10869400	10870480	Sugar, I don't have it.
10870480	10872000	Oh, you wanna quit too bad.
10872000	10873840	Oh, just milked him.
10873840	10875040	I'm so sorry, sir.
10875040	10877160	Oh, I'm sorry, sir, sorry.
10877160	10879120	I didn't mean anything by it.
10879120	10881280	I lost my keys and I can't get inside.
10883600	10884420	What pain?
10884420	10887460	I think I'm going into town to serve Lon Lon milk.
10887460	10890540	Oh, well, I can get in the whooshed nae-ball there, didn't you?
10890540	10891740	Didn't you mind me?
10892980	10894980	Girls are so cute when they're a little,
10894980	10896500	when they're a little rere-ere.
10897820	10900180	Okay, we need to find the key.
10900180	10901540	Or just on the other door.
10905620	10906460	Oh, there is.
10908940	10910580	Okay, we got the key, so now we need to go back
10910580	10913140	and be like, hey, we touched my goats' thumb, but...
10915300	10916940	We totally found it.
10916940	10920980	And it wasn't through any, not nefarious.
10920980	10923820	We had didn't have malicious intent behind finding the key.
10923820	10926940	Hey, sir, here's your key, all yours.
10927860	10929860	Oh, our one and only spare key.
10929860	10931220	I don't know how you got this,
10931220	10932260	but I can't thank you enough.
10932260	10933860	Tell me your name, Sunny Jim.
10933860	10935500	Link, that's a great name.
10935500	10938220	If you ever need to go to Lake Hyalil,
10938220	10939700	feel free to cut through our house.
10939700	10942420	Yes, that's exactly what we need to do.
10942420	10943940	Thank you very much, Link.
10944860	10945940	Shut up, little man.
10945940	10946780	Hello?
10947780	10951540	Come visit us again at any time, lady.
10951540	10953820	I'm just a wee lad, are you?
10953820	10955620	But if a lady invites you in our house,
10955620	10957420	who am I to know a blight?
10960820	10962220	Hello, cow.
10962220	10963820	Yes, of course, this is me.
10963820	10966820	Wait, I'm not getting any more Kinstone drops,
10966820	10969220	so I think we're at the limit of orbit gains
10969220	10970060	when we give those.
10970060	10972580	Oh, I'll tell a lie, I'll tell a Feverruni.
10973940	10975300	If she needs milk?
10975300	10976820	No, she's the one with the milk.
10976820	10978140	We're just a...
10979140	10981420	How tranquil, and those cows look so delicious.
10981420	10985340	No, we're not eating the cows.
10985340	10986180	Here we go.
10986180	10987420	We're not eating the cows.
10987420	10988940	We're not eating the cows.
10988940	10990340	We're not eating the cows.
10990340	10992220	We're not eating the cows.
10992260	10993660	How...
10993660	10994420	How is it?
10994420	10995260	Islo?
10997100	11000260	If you can't see Mariah,
11000260	11003740	can you see purple burglar out or did it?
11003740	11006540	One day we'll get through a stream, one day.
11006540	11007780	That stream is not today.
11009860	11012420	Yes, I can see it, but if I put on a heavy accent,
11012420	11013260	I can't see it.
11015460	11016300	What is that for?
11017300	11023300	Uh, there is a teleportation.
11026100	11027100	Like, hiro.
11028180	11029980	I'm so sorry, by the way,
11029980	11032700	for the purple burglar alarm corne meant.
11032700	11035620	I'm sorry if I sounded like so defeated.
11035620	11038100	I'm not like upset or anything.
11038100	11039500	It's just...
11039500	11042100	You're not the only one who asks about such things.
11042100	11044780	Wait, can I not get up there already?
11044780	11045780	I think I can.
11047300	11049380	Astrony is adorable.
11049380	11050900	Astrony is adorable.
11052260	11053620	Thank you.
11053620	11054860	You know who else is adorable?
11054860	11056180	You, please.
11056180	11057020	Exactly.
11061940	11063660	There's a heart.
11063660	11064860	Oh, no, but we can't reach it.
11064860	11066220	We need some to...
11066220	11067380	Oh, we got a serious.
11067380	11069100	We got a red one, though.
11069100	11071100	Do we go in a tunnel and try and get up?
11077300	11082820	Now, I am 99% sure there is an event,
11082820	11084420	a tamed event that comes up,
11084420	11086100	and I really don't want to screw it up.
11086100	11087700	Wait, I'll just go straight down.
11091900	11095420	And it's to trade that guy back in the one
11095420	11097900	that I tried to explode his house by accident.
11099220	11100820	So we might actually have to go back
11100820	11102380	because it's a tamed event.
11102380	11104300	And if you don't do it properly,
11104300	11105820	well, you're done, so...
11107300	11109300	Where am I going with this?
11110300	11112300	There better be a secret down here.
11115300	11116300	Oh, wow.
11116300	11117300	But I hope this is the right way.
11117300	11119300	I've just gone off the map.
11121300	11122300	Lake Helio.
11123300	11124300	Please see.
11124300	11126300	It's like, this way to Mayor Hagan's
11126300	11127300	Lake State Cabin.
11128300	11130300	Have I gone the wrong way?
11130300	11131300	Oh, my God.
11131300	11132300	Oh, no.
11132300	11133300	I'm just going to have to play the game
11133300	11134300	even more with you.
11134300	11135300	Let's see it.
11140300	11141300	Okay, I have gone the wrong way.
11141300	11142300	I'm pretty sure.
11142300	11143300	No, that's not true.
11143300	11145300	That's not going to stop me.
11146300	11147300	Wait.
11147300	11150300	No, well, I did go the right way by accident.
11159300	11161300	Ah, welcome.
11161300	11166300	Care for some of Granny's homemade blue potion.
11166300	11168300	One sip and you're full of energy.
11168300	11170300	Please look around.
11170300	11172300	I need this mushroom, please.
11173300	11176300	Oh, yes, a fine choice, my dear.
11176300	11178300	That is a limited time article.
11178300	11180300	One worth and you're wide awake.
11180300	11183300	That is why it is called a wake-up mushroom.
11183300	11185300	Would you like to buy it for 60 rupees?
11185300	11186300	That's for you.
11187300	11188300	You got a wake-up mushroom.
11188300	11189300	It's a nasty stench.
11189300	11191300	She chases away the sleepyhead.
11191300	11193300	Just face the sleepyhead through that
11193300	11195300	and press the button and he'll...
11195300	11197300	and the little eyes will pop right open
11197300	11198300	right out of the skull, yeah.
11198300	11199300	Thanks, Granny.
11199300	11201300	Please don't ever interact with me again.
11201300	11202300	You're terrifying.
11203300	11205300	Okay, if we're going back to town,
11205300	11206300	I'll try and do that.
11208300	11210300	But I don't want to miss out on the timed event.
11210300	11211300	Okay.
11211300	11212300	If you don't do it,
11212300	11214300	a gentleman actually perishes
11214300	11215300	and that's true.
11215300	11217300	Would you drink my blue juice?
11219300	11220300	You would.
11220300	11221300	Admit it.
11221300	11222300	I know you would.
11222300	11223300	No, you don't even have to admit it
11223300	11224300	because I know you just...
11224300	11225300	Sorry, I said that.
11227300	11228300	Whoa!
11230300	11231300	Whoa!
11231300	11232300	What are you doing here?
11232300	11234300	We got another heartbeat by accident.
11234300	11235300	I forgot.
11236300	11238300	See, exploring pays off
11238300	11240300	when you play legends of Zelda games
11240300	11242300	like they're soon forgiven.
11243300	11245300	Lon Lon Ranch.
11246300	11248300	I really need a fart right now.
11249300	11251300	I don't know, I shouldn't...
11252300	11254300	But I'm going to hold in.
11256300	11258300	I assume this is where I was supposed to go.
11258300	11260300	No, I was supposed to go up!
11260300	11261300	No!
11261300	11262300	No!
11262300	11264300	How did I get back up there again?
11264300	11265300	Ow!
11266300	11267300	Let's do that.
11268300	11269300	Just me a...
11270300	11271300	Let it rip.
11271300	11272300	Very question.
11272300	11274300	Would you drink the 20s Aimee?
11275300	11276300	Um...
11276300	11278300	I don't know how easily I can master this.
11278300	11279300	I'll be honest.
11279300	11281300	What are you guys?
11281300	11282300	Hello!
11283300	11284300	You don't look aggressive,
11284300	11286300	but I don't feel like you're angry.
11286300	11287300	You're not.
11287300	11288300	You wanna fuse?
11288300	11289300	Sure!
11289300	11290300	Hey, go buddy!
11291300	11292300	What does it do?
11292300	11293300	It's a Goron!
11293300	11295300	His name is Goron.
11298300	11299300	Eh?
11303300	11304300	Oh!
11304300	11305300	No!
11308300	11310300	It's been a long time since the last time
11310300	11311300	I visited Hyrule.
11311300	11313300	I think I'll stay at this place
11313300	11315300	and I can sell my Kinstone.
11315300	11316300	Yes!
11316300	11317300	This is exactly what we need.
11317300	11319300	We need to throw our money into him.
11322300	11323300	Wow, hydration check.
11323300	11325300	I need to start slipping my tear.
11325300	11326300	It's gonna get cold.
11328300	11330300	Hmm, they fit perfectly.
11330300	11331300	That's so good.
11331300	11332300	Are you okay?
11332300	11333300	This is one solid wall.
11333300	11335300	I need a few friends to give me a hand.
11335300	11337300	I will get you those friends soon, TM.
11337300	11338300	But not yet,
11338300	11340300	because I need to do other things.
11340300	11341300	Hold on.
11341300	11344300	Let me just cut down your produce for you.
11344300	11345300	Hello!
11345300	11346300	Oh!
11347300	11348300	Riplings!
11348300	11349300	They're farmed!
11349300	11350300	There's no one here,
11350300	11351300	so it's ours!
11351300	11352300	Oh!
11353300	11354300	Cosmo.
11354300	11355300	I love working in the garden.
11355300	11356300	It makes me feel so close to nature
11356300	11358300	and sometimes I dig off a Kinstone.
11358300	11359300	Right, okay.
11359300	11360300	We know what we're doing.
11361300	11362300	Hee hee hee.
11364300	11365300	Please, CJ.
11365300	11366300	I'm drink tea.
11366300	11367300	I drink tea.
11369300	11370300	Oh my god,
11370300	11371300	we already helped them out.
11374300	11376300	I feel so much stronger now.
11376300	11377300	Here we go.
11382300	11384300	Sorry, I'm drinking my tea.
11384300	11385300	It's about time.
11385300	11386300	Looking good, though.
11386300	11387300	I'm going in.
11388300	11390300	That's what Ripling said.
11395300	11396300	Look at that.
11396300	11397300	A perfect fit.
11397300	11398300	Okay, what about you?
11398300	11399300	Do you have one?
11399300	11400300	You do!
11401300	11403300	One a few Kinstone pieces?
11403300	11404300	Let's rock and roll.
11405300	11406300	Yes, please.
11406300	11407300	Oh, hold on.
11408300	11409300	Wait!
11409300	11410300	What?
11410300	11411300	I did it!
11411300	11412300	I did it!
11412300	11413300	Sorry, sorry.
11413300	11414300	I'm trying to play one-handed.
11415300	11416300	It's not that kind of game.
11416300	11417300	That comes later.
11417300	11418300	Okay, that comes in July.
11425300	11426300	I do remember seeing that.
11427300	11428300	The wall.
11428300	11430300	Okay, we're not going to go back to the wall.
11433300	11435300	That is very far away.
11435300	11437300	Look, I'm helping you tail the soil.
11438300	11439300	Oh, there's a sneaky poo.
11440300	11442300	We will hurt the sneaky poo.
11443300	11445300	But I want to talk to the guy first.
11445300	11446300	Hello.
11447300	11449300	Hello, I'm at a client.
11450300	11452300	Oh, no, you need a new buddy.
11452300	11453300	This is a solid wall.
11453300	11454300	I'm going to need a friend.
11454300	11455300	Okay, okay, okay.
11455300	11457300	We need to just keep doing the Kinstone
11457300	11459300	to unlock more events.
11461300	11464300	And I just realized we unlocked something back here.
11468300	11471300	We will go and get it right now.
11471300	11473300	Wait, what's over here?
11477300	11479300	Veil falls.
11479300	11480300	I don't...
11480300	11482300	No, we're not to be here yet.
11482300	11483300	Rit.
11483300	11484300	I saw that.
11486300	11487300	Spelunking.
11487300	11488300	No, I can't run.
11488300	11490300	I want to escape the word spelunk.
11491300	11492300	And he fell.
11492300	11493300	Spelunk.
11493300	11494300	Wah.
11494300	11495300	Okay, hold on.
11495300	11498300	Is the games being kind and giving me them again?
11501300	11502300	What's it?
11503300	11505300	I'm a fellow spunker, I have to admit.
11506300	11507300	Spunks all over you.
11510300	11513300	They're top left one, I think we unlocked.
11513300	11514300	Sorry, I keep taking damage
11514300	11516300	because I'm like hardly paying attention.
11516300	11518300	But not in a bad way, just like...
11519300	11520300	Mm-hmm.
11522300	11523300	Okay, okay, okay.
11523300	11525300	There's something in that chair.
11526300	11528300	Oh, red, that's perfect.
11531300	11532300	Mm-hmm.
11537300	11540300	No, no, spelunking means cave exploring.
11540300	11542300	That's what we're talking about.
11543300	11547300	Right, can I finally trade the freaking guy?
11547300	11549300	Oh, we need to do this.
11550300	11553300	Wait, it does disappear and he gets a fright every time.
11553300	11554300	We get it.
11554300	11555300	It's the same dialogue.
11555300	11556300	The dialogue hasn't changed.
11556300	11559300	Oh, she's selling her milkies.
11559300	11562300	I'm selling creamy nutritious llama milk.
11562300	11563300	It's Azura.
11563300	11565300	Don't buy, sorry, I'm not that rich.
11565300	11566300	I'm a child.
11566300	11567300	Do you want a fuse?
11567300	11568300	Yes, please.
11568300	11571300	I don't have the freaking one you seek.
11572300	11573300	What about you?
11574300	11575300	Yes, I do have what you seek.
11575300	11577300	Finally, one that I have.
11583300	11585300	Oh, this is at the castle.
11590300	11591300	Goat milk, yeah.
11591300	11593300	I remember when I teased Azura,
11593300	11595300	everyone was like, a cowgirl?
11595300	11597300	I'm like, no, that's far too obvious.
11597300	11599300	What other thing produces milk?
11601300	11602300	Goat.
11602300	11603300	Um...
11604300	11606300	I thought it was clever anyway.
11606300	11607300	I thought it was good.
11608300	11610300	This one, yes, I want to fuse.
11610300	11612300	This is the time-gated one,
11612300	11614300	so we're going to do this right now,
11614300	11617300	so no one passes away due to my foolishness, okay?
11620300	11621300	Mm.
11621300	11623300	So this is right above our house,
11623300	11625300	we're going to go back to our house really quickly.
11625300	11627300	Goth boy, cleat at the castle.
11628300	11630300	Fusing stones with Malon.
11631300	11632300	Mm.
11632300	11634300	Wait, is she actually called Malon?
11636300	11639300	Is that supposed to be because of her melons?
11639300	11640300	How's your name, Malon?
11643300	11645300	Yeah, you can tell her names.
11646300	11648300	You know, I don't think I've ever tried goat milk before.
11649300	11652300	If Azura didn't have an upset tummy,
11652300	11654300	I think it would be adorable
11654300	11658300	to get her to try all the different milk.
11659300	11661300	But unfortunately, Azura has an upset tummy.
11664300	11667300	Okay, are you ready?
11668300	11672300	You have to do this, or else you perish on a fire,
11672300	11675300	and this poor gentleman passes away.
11676300	11677300	So, hi.
11677300	11679300	Goodness, we rarely get visitors.
11679300	11682300	Tell me, how did you get here via teleportation?
11684300	11685300	Are you okay?
11685300	11688300	Nobody believes me, but I saw a ghost that's taken over Granda.
11688300	11689300	Yes.
11689300	11692300	If you do not suck away the ghost,
11692300	11694300	he literally passes away.
11694300	11697300	I can't believe old Greggal is sick.
11697300	11698300	He was looking so healthy,
11698300	11700300	I guess something just took a hold of him.
11701300	11704300	Literally, if you do not do this.
11707300	11709300	Okay, now that thing's strong.
11711300	11714300	Well, well, well, look at how the colours come back to his face.
11714300	11716300	How can I ever thank you?
11716300	11719300	I still have a hard time believing he'd been possessed by a monster, though.
11719300	11721300	Well, I don't find it hard at all.
11721300	11723300	What, an evil spirit had taken a hold of me?
11723300	11725300	And you drove it away?
11725300	11726300	You might be right.
11726300	11728300	I already feel my energy returning.
11728300	11730300	I'll be able to get out of bed soon.
11730300	11731300	What's your name?
11731300	11732300	Link.
11732300	11733300	Thank you, my boy.
11733300	11734300	You saved me.
11734300	11735300	I'm a hundred shell.
11735300	11737300	If you do not do that,
11737300	11740300	before you unlock this area,
11740300	11743300	the non-teleportation way,
11743300	11745300	he is no longer in the game.
11746300	11750300	And you literally cause him to perish if you do not do that.
11751300	11754300	Now, all is good and we can go back to the main quest.
11755300	11756300	80% forehead.
11756300	11758300	But he's just an elder and he's smart.
11758300	11760300	Okay, where's he going to put all the knowledge and wisdom?
11762300	11763300	Exactly.
11763300	11765300	So you didn't think that far ahead, did you?
11766300	11768300	Oh, I forgot to do the wee bird.
11769300	11770300	Hello.
11770300	11771300	Are you going to teach me something?
11771300	11772300	A new sword.
11772300	11773300	Fantastic.
11773300	11775300	And you seem to have acquired new skills with it.
11775300	11777300	I'm going to train you again, young swordsman.
11777300	11778300	Will you accept?
11778300	11780300	Yes, we will.
11780300	11783300	I will now teach you a technique called the rock breaker.
11783300	11784300	So pay attention.
11784300	11787300	First, swing your sword to break pots.
11787300	11790300	Actually, that's all there is to it, young swordsman.
11790300	11791300	Do you understand?
11791300	11792300	Yes.
11793300	11794300	Yes, good.
11794300	11799300	If you had said you didn't understand, I would have serious doubts about you.
11799300	11801300	Yes, you must feel the technique.
11801300	11805300	But one must feel the technique, not just hear about it.
11805300	11809300	That's why I will now possess your body and do as to demonstrate the technique.
11809300	11814300	That is the secret of the swift blade possession technique of training.
11814300	11815300	Watch this.
11818300	11819300	Position.
11824300	11825300	Poof.
11825300	11827300	Now you must try it for yourself.
11827300	11829300	Break the pots with your sword.
11829300	11830300	That's all.
11831300	11832300	Yes, fine work.
11832300	11833300	Fantastic even.
11833300	11835300	I now give you the tiger scroll.
11835300	11838300	If you ever forget the technique, you can read it in the scroll.
11838300	11840300	Rock breaker fighting technique.
11840300	11844300	Shatter pots and pulverize boulders with a single blow.
11845300	11847300	Is there anything else I can do?
11849300	11852300	Come again when you learn to run like the wind.
11852300	11853300	Hmm.
11853300	11854300	I suppose.
11854300	11856300	Wait, how did I get to that chickadee?
11860300	11861300	I don't know.
11861300	11864300	I actually don't know how to get into the shuffle though.
11865300	11868300	There's a singing thing.
11868300	11870300	I don't know what that's about.
11871300	11876300	I want to do this, but I don't think we're there yet.
11877300	11878300	Hello.
11878300	11880300	Bring whatever piece you'd like to shape.
11880300	11882300	You're like a simple amount of personal taste.
11882300	11883300	Goodle.
11883300	11885300	Oh, he wants to do it again.
11886300	11887300	Get again again.
11888300	11890300	Okay, I'll see, I'll see.
11896300	11898300	Oh, unlock something in the room.
11901300	11902300	Hi, Jason, hi, Jason.
11903300	11904300	They fit perfectly.
11904300	11907300	Oh, I expect my sales will be tripled by this.
11909300	11913300	So did they, did they just go in order or what, they need it?
11916300	11918300	Oh, that's up north.
11920300	11922300	There might be life inside of that.
11922300	11926300	I think we'll go do that like right now because I think there's going to be an extra life in there.
11926300	11928300	Like a heart container, pardon me.
11929300	11932300	I know, I'm sorry for people who want me to just do the main quest,
11932300	11934300	but that's the fun thing about the Zelda game,
11934300	11936300	is you get to do all this fun side stuff.
11942300	11943300	Oh, it's a fairy.
11943300	11944300	Sure.
11945300	11949300	You found a fairy, a reliable ally to cleanse your health.
11949300	11951300	If you trap a fairy in a jar.
11954300	11956300	Not like that, Riflin.
11956300	11959300	Um, this wing friend will come to your aid.
11959300	11962300	Don't put the fairy in the jar for other reasons.
11962300	11964300	Do I make myself clear, Riflings?
11965300	11966300	Good.
11968300	11969300	The fairies are so cute in this game.
11969300	11972300	Yes, this is a very cute pixel game.
11973300	11976300	Is there, so can I just keep like Kinstone into the same,
11976300	11978300	I can, just over and over again.
11978300	11980300	I guess it mustn't really matter.
11982300	11983300	Oh no, I can't do you.
11984300	11986300	Is there anything here in here?
11988300	11989300	A boomerang?
11991300	11993300	Hello, how much is this?
11993300	11994300	300!
11996300	11998300	Oh, he's got a jar behind him.
11998300	12000300	Wait, how did I get here?
12002300	12004300	He's got a jar, I need two jars.
12006300	12008300	Ah, sugar, I can't do it yet.
12008300	12010300	I must be after this one.
12011300	12015300	You're going to need a lot more zinc tomatoes and pineapples.
12018300	12020300	Remember to have tomatoes.
12020300	12026300	This is good for you and your, your twins question mark.
12026300	12028300	Can I choose you because you're so cute.
12028300	12030300	You're so adorable.
12031300	12033300	What do you unlock, little trick-a-dee?
12034300	12038300	The other fountain in the, the...
12038300	12040300	Castello.
12042300	12045300	You can push it, you've got to be big.
12045300	12048300	No, I need a ring, it's like a special ring.
12048300	12052300	Bye-bye, I'm going to finish, I'm not like my brother so I'm going to look at it.
12052300	12054300	Okay, thank you.
12055300	12057300	Thank you very much.
12058300	12060300	Thank you very much.
12063300	12065300	Uh...
12067300	12071300	That's what it is, I need the library to open up and put me on the book quest,
12071300	12074300	but that's not yet, it's after the swamp break.
12074300	12078300	We'll go pick up our shoes because I have been dilly-dallying enough.
12081300	12082300	Wakey-wakey.
12082300	12085300	If I recall correctly, and I guarantee that I do, my boy,
12085300	12090300	I think syrup said to stand in front of the sleeping person and press the right bumper.
12093300	12095300	It was literally just the interactive key.
12097300	12100300	What is that terrifyingly bad smell?
12100300	12101300	It's just me, sorry mate.
12101300	12104300	I wake up mushroom, I should have guessed, so you woke me up.
12104300	12107300	Thanks, I just remembered I have something urgent I need to do.
12108300	12110300	Oh, what now?
12110300	12113300	There are more new shoes, you probably won't believe this,
12113300	12117300	but I have a strange habit of making shoes in my sleep.
12117300	12121300	So you must have come here because you want some of my shoes, right? Tell me.
12121300	12124300	What, because you're so nice enough to wake me up, you can have them,
12124300	12127300	hold on a second though, I just need the finishing touches.
12132300	12134300	And there we go, here, take these.
12134300	12136300	These are my special Pegasus boots.
12136300	12140300	They're so light, you'll feel like you're practically walking on air.
12140300	12145300	You got the Pegasus boots, hold the button to run faster than the wind.
12145300	12148300	Oh, I need to hurry up and get working on that special order,
12148300	12151300	the king asked me to make some shoes for Princess Del D.C.
12151300	12153300	Thanks for waking me up, come back if you ever need help,
12153300	12155300	or if you have any shoe problems.
12155300	12158300	Now we don't actually have any shoe problems.
12158300	12161300	But we're gonna go back to the swordsman,
12162300	12165300	because he will know teachers and new moves.
12165300	12167300	Got them Jordans on.
12168300	12170300	Ah yes, you have the Pegasus boots,
12170300	12172300	and you seem to have more skill too.
12172300	12176300	Yes, I am ready to train you again.
12177300	12179300	I got almost just one minute there, huh?
12179300	12182300	You will now learn a new technique called the dash attack.
12182300	12185300	First, equip the Pegasus boots, equip your sword,
12185300	12188300	third, run like crazy, that's all you need, do you understand?
12188300	12189300	Yes.
12189300	12192300	Yes, yes, you are my finest student.
12192300	12194300	Just equip the sword and the Pegasus boots,
12194300	12197300	and any button you like, but one must feel the technique,
12197300	12199300	not just feel about it,
12199300	12202300	that's why I will now possess your body to demonstrate it.
12202300	12204300	Watch this!
12204300	12206300	Position!
12208300	12209300	Bonk!
12210300	12215300	So now we can dash like crazy while having it out in front of us.
12215300	12217300	We don't have to do anything else.
12217300	12220300	Yes, fine work, you now take this tiger stroll.
12220300	12223300	If you ever forget, just reach the stroll.
12223300	12224300	We now know dash attack.
12224300	12226300	Run like the wind and attack.
12226300	12230300	Do you have anything more for me, or am I coming back?
12230300	12233300	Come again when you can jump further.
12234300	12237300	Got them jays on my feet.
12239300	12243300	I'm sure there was something we could do.
12243300	12245300	But I forgot.
12247300	12250300	Out my way, out my way, ya bam.
12250300	12254300	Wasn't there a special fairy tree over here?
12254300	12255300	No?
12255300	12258300	Yes, I knew there was!
12258300	12261300	Whenever you see a tree sparkle, do that.
12262300	12267300	And then become tiny, and then we can go explore.
12267300	12270300	We're just so good at exploring.
12270300	12273300	Garfunkel, thank you for coming a member.
12273300	12275300	You moved the rock for me, great.
12275300	12277300	I thought I'd never get outside.
12277300	12279300	Aw, poor little guy, we're stuck.
12279300	12281300	Look at his wee decorations.
12281300	12283300	Got wee knick knacks over here,
12283300	12285300	his wee cutlery set,
12285300	12287300	all alone in my room.
12287300	12288300	I love what you've done with the place,
12288300	12290300	with a little rope on the wall.
12290300	12292300	What you're into is fine.
12292300	12294300	A little leaf like this stuff.
12294300	12296300	I just want to play a cute little pixel game like this,
12296300	12299300	and I don't know, maybe it's like making the townspeople happy.
12299300	12302300	You know what, I'm just going to straight up develop it.
12302300	12306300	I think I've said, um, not a,
12306300	12311300	kind of after a reveal or, um,
12311300	12314300	maybe going into fucking games.
12314300	12317300	It's a game published in, where like, I pay a studio
12317300	12319300	and make my game.
12319300	12321300	Maybe doing that, basically.
12321300	12324300	Um, but I'm happy to show the behind the scenes.
12324300	12326300	I mean, fuck me, I can never be quiet
12326300	12328300	whenever I've got a project going.
12328300	12329300	I'm like, and this is what I'm doing right now,
12329300	12330300	this is how I'm doing it, right?
12330300	12332300	You guys do this, this is how I do it.
12332300	12334300	Um, literally, I can't even keep my gob shot
12334300	12337300	when I've got something going for me.
12337300	12340300	Um, I'll just see how it goes.
12340300	12342300	I do have an idea.
12342300	12344300	I want to work with a studio,
12344300	12346300	but the problem is that you need to get, like,
12346300	12348300	fucking lawyers involved and everything.
12348300	12350300	I had to, I felt so bad.
12350300	12352300	So the VLR game, I feel really bad.
12352300	12357300	I had to get a fucking lawyer's piece of shit contract
12357300	12359300	because of the game.
12359300	12363300	Like, because obviously I had to pay for it to be produced.
12363300	12365300	It's not out yet for anyone that's like,
12365300	12366300	huh, how are you talking about the game?
12366300	12368300	I'm not playing the game from VLR.
12368300	12370300	It's not out yet, it's not out yet.
12370300	12372300	It's been developed, we're in the last stages.
12372300	12376300	We're just waiting for the animation of the art to come through.
12376300	12379300	Um, which is taking a bit more of a,
12379300	12382300	um, it takes longer for that kind of side of production.
12382300	12384300	Um, but I've got a good deal.
12384300	12386300	Thanks to the developer I'm working with
12386300	12389300	because, uh, I cannot go that way.
12389300	12391300	Will it be on Steam?
12391300	12393300	No, it is an itch-y-o game.
12393300	12395300	It is wildly inappropriate for Steam.
12395300	12397300	Haha.
12397300	12399300	Ah, Sneaky's.
12399300	12400300	Go away.
12400300	12401300	Leave me alone.
12401300	12403300	Uh-uh-uh.
12403300	12405300	I don't want to hear it.
12405300	12407300	Where the heck did I go?
12407300	12409300	I don't know.
12409300	12410300	I will buy it.
12410300	12413300	Well, speaking of buying it, it's completely free.
12413300	12415300	You do not need to give me any money.
12415300	12419300	It was a developmental decision
12419300	12421300	in order to promote the girls,
12421300	12424300	and everyone can get a bit of a taste of the girls,
12424300	12425300	if you will.
12425300	12428300	Um, I opted to make the game free.
12428300	12430300	You do not have to pay for it.
12430300	12432300	It cost a pretty penny to produce,
12432300	12435300	but that, ultimately, was my decision.
12435300	12437300	Um...
12439300	12442300	It's definitely a good learning experience.
12442300	12444300	Oh, it's bugging me, sorry.
12444300	12447300	Meekoo's big fan, thank you very much for the 10 gifted.
12447300	12449300	Congrats to who gets that.
12449300	12451300	Yeah, it's definitely the girl.
12453300	12455300	Um...
12455300	12457300	Hello?
12457300	12459300	I am just a child.
12459300	12461300	Leave me alone.
12461300	12463300	Hello?
12463300	12464300	I don't...
12464300	12466300	Okay, I can hit his back if he does that.
12466300	12467300	Right.
12467300	12468300	Oh my gosh.
12468300	12470300	What if we want to pay for it anyway?
12470300	12473300	Um, just support any of the girls then?
12473300	12475300	Um...
12475300	12477300	The publisher can also be tipped
12477300	12479300	if you really like his work.
12479300	12481300	Um...
12481300	12483300	Oh, it's golden.
12483300	12485300	It's golden, why would it be golden?
12486300	12488300	Um, but yeah, it's free.
12488300	12491300	If you want to tip and be like, thanks for the game...
12491300	12493300	What if we want to pay for it anyway though?
12493300	12494300	Um...
12494300	12496300	If you ever felt so inclined, support any of the girls
12496300	12498300	or if you want to directly do it to me,
12498300	12501300	then do it to me, like on stream elements
12501300	12503300	is the best way to do it.
12503300	12505300	Or Patreon, to be honest.
12505300	12507300	Like, even if like...
12507300	12509300	Some people are like, oh, I feel really bad.
12509300	12511300	I've only got like five bucks to give.
12511300	12513300	You don't, like...
12513300	12514300	What's the word?
12514300	12516300	It's like such a cascade in effect.
12516300	12518300	I don't know where the heck...
12518300	12519300	I'm supposed to go.
12519300	12521300	I'm like rambling through the swamp section.
12521300	12522300	I'm so sorry.
12522300	12523300	Um...
12523300	12526300	Like, it adds up incredibly...
12526300	12528300	Oh, I'll take that, thank you very much.
12528300	12530300	Um, it adds up incredibly quickly.
12530300	12532300	Like, never be like, oh, I feel bad that I can't like,
12532300	12534300	give any money, I can't do this, I can't do that.
12534300	12536300	Like, don't ever feel like that because
12536300	12538300	the money like adds up so fricking...
12538300	12540300	Here's my pre-order in the game.
12540300	12543300	The game is free.
12543300	12545300	You don't need to give any money.
12546300	12549300	Right, I've got a golden piece.
12549300	12551300	Is it here, I'm supposed to go?
12551300	12554300	Oh, I'm getting all turned around now.
12556300	12558300	There's a cavern here.
12561300	12562300	Oh, how much do you want?
12562300	12565300	I want to sell you arrows, but you don't have a bow.
12567300	12568300	What was I saying again?
12568300	12571300	I've already forgotten my fricking subject!
12571300	12572300	Right.
12573300	12575300	I don't think so, at least.
12576300	12577300	Um...
12578300	12580300	Bro, where am I supposed to go?
12581300	12583300	I'm going like, all the wrong ways.
12586300	12589300	I assume this is a dead end until I get yours.
12590300	12592300	Oh, I don't know how I've successfully gone the wrong way.
12592300	12593300	Like, eight times now?
12593300	12595300	I've already been here.
12595300	12596300	You know...
12598300	12600300	Did I come down here?
12600300	12601300	I did.
12601300	12603300	Is there anything else here though?
12613300	12614300	I think I'm special needs.
12614300	12615300	Hold on.
12616300	12618300	Sorry, I need to try hard.
12618300	12621300	I don't know where I'm to go.
12625300	12629300	I've got a keystone piece that was golden, right?
12630300	12635300	No, that is one nasty looking statue that I had evil glower to.
12638300	12639300	Hold on.
12640300	12643300	Sorry, I'm genuinely unsure what to do.
12643300	12645300	I've already been down there.
12645300	12648300	I've already been here, and then this looks like a dead end,
12648300	12651300	but I don't go down it, so maybe this isn't a dead end,
12651300	12653300	and I'm just the top of the damn thing?
12656300	12657300	So it is a dead end.
12658300	12659300	Hold on.
12659300	12660300	Processing.
12660300	12661300	What?
12661300	12664300	It says get a bow, but I didn't have a bow.
12667300	12669300	The wee mushroom guy.
12669300	12670300	The business scrub.
12671300	12673300	Which is me, by the way.
12673300	12675300	Oh, idiot features!
12675300	12678300	Pegasus boots to get me across here.
12680300	12682300	Oh, not the water though, Link.
12682300	12683300	Not the water though.
12684300	12686300	Yeah, sorry, that...
12686300	12688300	That must have been painfully obvious.
12688300	12689300	I do apologise.
12689300	12691300	Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
12691300	12693300	Go across the swamp water.
12694300	12695300	Okay, what is this?
12695300	12697300	Ah, we're working this before.
12697300	12698300	Sorry.
12702300	12704300	Oh, look at the flowers.
12705300	12706300	What's beautiful.
12706300	12707300	Um...
12709300	12713300	Yes, I made the decision to make the game free for promotional reasons.
12716300	12717300	The game is not out.
12717300	12718300	Thank you for the money.
12718300	12719300	The game is not out.
12719300	12721300	I do apologise, the lay lover,
12721300	12722300	but thank you for the money.
12727300	12728300	I'm getting spanked about.
12732300	12733300	I'm spamming, I'm spamming.
12734300	12736300	Oh my god, is this a bow and arrow?
12738300	12739300	Oh, thank god, we've got a bow.
12739300	12740300	Right, we've got a bow.
12741300	12742300	The game...
12743300	12746300	It will be tweeted about from all the girls' accounts
12746300	12748300	and all of that jazz, so don't worry.
12748300	12750300	You'll know when it comes out.
12750300	12751300	It's still in development,
12751300	12753300	but the base is there.
12755300	12757300	Waiting on animated artwork to come back.
12757300	12759300	And then I just need to hand over the audio.
12761300	12763300	I need to break all the audios down.
12766300	12768300	But it makes the game cheaper if I do the work, so...
12769300	12771300	I'm not going to outsource the work,
12771300	12772300	but thank you again for the tip.
12774300	12777300	The name of it is a pun.
12777300	12779300	Is anyone surprised at this point?
12779300	12780300	The answer is...
12781300	12783300	Okay, let's go back this way.
12787300	12789300	Okay, okay, now that we have the bow,
12789300	12791300	we can poke them in the eyes.
12792300	12793300	Oh, that wasn't very nice.
12793300	12795300	I'm going to have to admit that wasn't quite mean.
12798300	12800300	Let's outsource the audio.
12800300	12801300	No, it's like more money.
12801300	12803300	I spent a lot of money on the game
12803300	12805300	to get it produced.
12806300	12807300	I think...
12807300	12808300	Oh, I don't know.
12808300	12810300	Should I say it out loud?
12814300	12816300	It's over 10,000 US dollars.
12816300	12817300	How about that?
12817300	12818300	It took me 10,000.
12818300	12820300	And I know someone's going to play
12820300	12821300	and be like,
12821300	12822300	this game's shit.
12822300	12823300	I can't believe you paid that much money for it.
12823300	12824300	And it's like, bro,
12824300	12826300	I'm going to just fucking relax.
12826300	12827300	Oh, yeah.
12829300	12831300	Game development isn't cheap.
12831300	12832300	It isn't easy.
12832300	12833300	It isn't fast.
12833300	12834300	It isn't this.
12834300	12835300	It isn't that.
12835300	12836300	What the heck is this?
12836300	12837300	Hello, Mr. Gravestone.
12843300	12844300	Two more.
12844300	12845300	10K.
12845300	12846300	Oh, it's a bit more than that,
12846300	12848300	but I'll say it's 10K.
12848300	12850300	Though my body may have perished.
12850300	12853300	Strongly be voicing by Chris Pratt.
12853300	12854300	No.
12854300	12855300	Someone was like,
12855300	12857300	I don't have a male voice in the game.
12857300	12858300	I was like,
12858300	12860300	why on earth would the male voice be in the game
12860300	12862300	if the entire point of the game is to
12862300	12864300	be allure?
12864300	12867300	Why would there randomly be a male voice?
12867300	12869300	Moment is too generous.
12869300	12871300	Though my body may perish,
12871300	12873300	I'm still a true swordsman of Hyrule.
12873300	12875300	Swiftblade, the first spirit of a swordsman.
12875300	12876300	If you train with me,
12876300	12877300	I will teach you skills that,
12877300	12879300	hmm, it seems you're not ready to train with me.
12879300	12880300	Come back when you have...
12883300	12884300	I'll come all this way in a swamp.
12885300	12886300	And you're telling...
12886300	12887300	Okay, I'm not that mad,
12887300	12889300	because there was a Kinstone piece outside the Gravestone.
12889300	12891300	I'll let it slide this time.
12895300	12896300	Bitches.
12898300	12899300	I already know
12901300	12902300	what game
12902300	12904300	I want to produce
12904300	12906300	for Gen 2.
12906300	12908300	Every generation is going to have a free
12908300	12911300	access kind of game.
12911300	12913300	And I already know what
12913300	12915300	the...
12915300	12917300	I'm drowning.
12917300	12919300	I'm drowning again.
12919300	12921300	I already know what the other game types
12921300	12922300	are going to be.
12922300	12924300	I hope people find it humorous,
12924300	12927300	because it's kind of a parody of...
12930300	12932300	Oh, that's what the golden...
12932300	12933300	Oh, we need to go back.
12933300	12934300	We need to go back.
12934300	12935300	We've gone too far.
12935300	12936300	We need to go back.
12937300	12939300	Wait, so there's going to be voice acting?
12939300	12940300	Yeah, by us.
12940300	12941300	By all the viewers,
12941300	12943300	the girls have already recorded their lines.
12944300	12946300	Now, I will say one thing.
12947300	12949300	The lines were very important
12949300	12951300	to be recorded first.
12951300	12953300	So, before you're like,
12953300	12955300	this person doesn't sound that confident.
12955300	12957300	Yeah, probably because it was very early
12957300	12959300	into knowing each other.
12959300	12960300	And I sent them the script,
12960300	12963300	and some of them have good experience.
12963300	12965300	Some of them are kind of new to it,
12965300	12967300	but are aware of the...
12967300	12969300	I'll push that down.
12972300	12974300	Does he come after me?
12974300	12975300	I don't know.
12976300	12978300	Is it an FPS stereo?
12978300	12979300	No.
12979300	12981300	It's not like a full, developed AAA title.
12981300	12983300	It's literally to play one-handed.
12983300	12984300	There's not much more to it.
12984300	12986300	Where am I supposed to go?
12986300	12988300	Am I supposed to go down?
12988300	12990300	No, I'm supposed to go over here.
12991300	12992300	Overwatch 3.
12992300	12994300	No, I did not produce Overwatch 3.
12994300	12996300	Literally, it's just a one-handed game,
12996300	12998300	but games are not easy to produce.
12998300	13000300	Easy or cheap to produce.
13000300	13002300	And I still need to pay the artist.
13002300	13004300	I forgot to pay the artist.
13004300	13006300	Is it other 50%?
13006300	13008300	Oh, right, we just need one more piece now.
13008300	13010300	That's fantastic.
13014300	13016300	We can go back up here.
13016300	13018300	Then we need to claim up.
13022300	13024300	If Blizzard had any sense,
13024300	13026300	Overwatch 3 would be a one-handed game too.
13026300	13028300	No, that's so good.
13028300	13030300	That's terrible, but that's not good.
13041300	13043300	Let's do this.
13043300	13045300	Okay, the Pegasus.
13045300	13047300	Probably see there's only one thing about this game
13047300	13049300	is we have to constantly go in the menus.
13049300	13051300	I need to push this down, actually.
13055300	13057300	Question mark, we did it.
13058300	13059300	Yes!
13059300	13061300	Okay, we can go straight back again.
13061300	13064300	And we don't need arrows from that guy,
13064300	13066300	because we're already full.
13066300	13068300	Yes, the Overwatch industry
13068300	13070300	is probably bigger than the playable...
13070300	13072300	Oh, I do not doubt it.
13072300	13076300	I'm sorry, they absolutely ran that game to the ground.
13076300	13078300	I'm like, hope it was worth it.
13078300	13080300	I genuinely hope it was worth it.
13080300	13082300	Although it's saying that...
13082300	13084300	What's that game?
13084300	13086300	Valorant?
13086300	13088300	All they do is sell...
13088300	13090300	It's a free-to-play,
13090300	13092300	but all they do is that skin stuff as well.
13092300	13094300	And they've found pretty good success,
13094300	13096300	so...
13096300	13098300	Maybe...
13098300	13100300	Is that what I should do?
13100300	13102300	I should put skins behind a paywall.
13102300	13103300	That's ridiculous.
13103300	13105300	Then what's behind here?
13107300	13109300	That noise.
13109300	13112300	Wait, don't he coax them to me?
13112300	13114300	Okay, now come this way.
13117300	13120300	He does look awfully venison.
13123300	13125300	Oh, it's just for a chest.
13125300	13127300	Oh, okay, it's blue.
13127300	13128300	Oh!
13130300	13132300	I'm too skilled.
13135300	13137300	I didn't trust that when they popped off.
13137300	13140300	I was like, they did not come out of the grass.
13140300	13142300	I knew they didn't come out of the grass.
13142300	13145300	Probably because Valorant was sold as a PvP.
13146300	13148300	So it didn't have hint for the camp.
13148300	13150300	Wait, you're still in my way?
13151300	13153300	Oh my god, stop for real, for real.
13154300	13156300	Can't go that way, which is...
13156300	13158300	Fane.
13158300	13160300	I've already forgotten how to get...
13160300	13162300	I think I need to go up again,
13162300	13165300	and then do that swamp route in order to get where I need to go?
13167300	13170300	Yes, I do need to do the swamp route, which is fine.
13176300	13178300	Huh?
13178300	13179300	I don't know.
13179300	13180300	I forgot.
13180300	13181300	Wait, how did I get up there?
13181300	13182300	Ah, okay, okay.
13182300	13184300	Stab them in the eye.
13184300	13186300	Yeah, honestly, I'd be pretty enraged, too,
13186300	13187300	if that happened to me.
13187300	13188300	I'd be mad.
13192300	13194300	Can I get any cannons?
13194300	13195300	Please.
13195300	13197300	This one, please.
13199300	13201300	Thanks for joining.
13201300	13204300	I say that as if I'm not about to go off in 20 minutes,
13204300	13207300	because I need to do my forbidden tier stream.
13207300	13211300	Whoa, I made that by a centimeter.
13212300	13213300	By a millimeter.
13213300	13216300	Wait, no, this isn't where I'm supposed to go.
13216300	13218300	But it's near here.
13218300	13220300	I just need to get done.
13221300	13223300	Okay, okay, we did it, we did it.
13226300	13229300	Two Kenstone pieces fit perfectly together.
13231300	13232300	Bunk.
13233300	13236300	And they're last, but certainly not least.
13237300	13239300	Don't forget to eat a set of me.
13239300	13241300	I absolutely will not forget.
13241300	13244300	I actually need to get the thumbnail to put up the member stream.
13244300	13246300	I'll put it 15 minutes past,
13246300	13249300	because I might need to squeeze out a loaf of bread.
13249300	13254300	I think the painkillers are making my loaf of bread
13254300	13256300	severely impacted.
13256300	13258300	That's terrible.
13259300	13261300	And a couple more hours of member stream.
13261300	13262300	No.
13263300	13266300	I'm going to redirect into Emmy when she goes up,
13266300	13268300	and then 15 minutes later, the member stream will be there.
13268300	13270300	Like, I'll put it up, don't worry.
13270300	13272300	The heck with you.
13274300	13275300	Ooh.
13276300	13278300	Oh, I don't like you.
13278300	13279300	Oh, I can perish you though.
13279300	13280300	That's fine.
13280300	13281300	Okay.
13281300	13282300	Yeah, just stay stuck on that.
13282300	13283300	That's fine.
13283300	13284300	You don't scare me.
13285300	13289300	Is the tier list at the same time as Emmy?
13289300	13291300	Yes, but it'll stay up.
13291300	13293300	Whoa, what was that enemy?
13293300	13294300	I saw that.
13295300	13296300	I saw that.
13297300	13298300	We'll grab it.
13298300	13299300	We'll grab it.
13299300	13302300	We need all the moonies and...
13308300	13309300	Ah, perfect.
13309300	13310300	We got a red one.
13310300	13311300	Hello.
13311300	13314300	These soldier statues here were built by the Minish ages ago
13314300	13315300	to help humans.
13315300	13316300	It's kind of a secret,
13316300	13319300	but there's a switch inside that turns them on or off.
13319300	13321300	A switch, you say?
13321300	13323300	Conditioning, you say?
13323300	13324300	So nice.
13327300	13328300	I was going to say,
13328300	13330300	I'm sure you can climb these guys.
13330300	13332300	Right, now that he's activated,
13332300	13335300	he will wake up and you just stole his stuff.
13335300	13336300	Literally, hi!
13336300	13338300	Opens chest first, doesn't even greet him.
13342300	13345300	Oh, he actually bounces me back.
13345300	13347300	He's that much of a talent.
13347300	13348300	Honestly.
13349300	13351300	I see that thing.
13352300	13353300	I see it.
13355300	13357300	I actually don't think we're going to have enough time
13357300	13359300	to do the freaking dungeon.
13362300	13364300	What's Emmy doing today?
13367300	13370300	Be honest, what game's Emmy playing?
13371300	13373300	Is she doing a two-hour stream?
13373300	13375300	Or is she doing ASMR?
13380300	13382300	Do you want me to do the member stream
13382300	13384300	two hours after Emmy starts?
13384300	13386300	Because Azur is off
13386300	13388300	and Mercy's off.
13388300	13390300	And I don't think Emmy would do ASMR
13390300	13392300	more than two hours because it gets a bit
13392300	13394300	really sore in the voice after two hours.
13394300	13397300	Brainwashing ASMR, yeah, it's my Emmy.
13397300	13399300	Shibuya's at eight.
13399300	13401300	Wait, I thought Shibuya was off.
13401300	13402300	Wait.
13404300	13407300	Oh, is Sheepster's a bit later?
13411300	13413300	As much as I would love to watch the member stream,
13413300	13415300	I want to watch Emmy.
13418300	13420300	If that's the case,
13422300	13424300	I can play this game for another two hours
13424300	13426300	and then whoever wants to watch Emmy
13426300	13428300	can go watch Emmy.
13430300	13433300	I don't know, this game is nasty looking.
13434300	13435300	We are so back.
13435300	13436300	What a name!
13436300	13438300	Oh my god, your icons!
13438300	13440300	We ace the call.
13440300	13441300	That's so precious.
13441300	13443300	I love when you guys have like
13443300	13445300	the girls'...
13445300	13447300	Let's get rid of the snakes first
13447300	13449300	because they are scary.
13449300	13451300	I love when you guys have the girls'
13451300	13453300	oh-she-marks or like their profile pictures
13453300	13455300	them or their name is there.
13455300	13457300	I'm just like, oh, my bye-bye.
13457300	13459300	I'm so glad you guys can enjoy it.
13459300	13461300	Draco, thank you for coming.
13461300	13462300	Remember?
13462300	13464300	Oh, I'm glad I caught that grass.
13464300	13465300	I didn't realize.
13465300	13467300	I thought it was going to restart.
13468300	13470300	I heart you very much.
13470300	13471300	Yes.
13472300	13474300	It was concepted that A.C.
13474300	13476300	So I've...
13476300	13477300	I haven't said it.
13477300	13479300	Obviously only the development team
13479300	13480300	could see the designs.
13480300	13482300	And A.C. by far was voted
13482300	13485300	the most well-liked
13485300	13487300	designer...
13487300	13488300	whatever...
13488300	13489300	whatever.
13491300	13493300	So...
13493300	13495300	we popped her
13495300	13497300	in my
13497300	13499300	lore video
13499300	13501300	and it was a cute little kind of like cameo.
13501300	13503300	I can even call it a cameo.
13504300	13505300	She would just...
13505300	13506300	she's the muse
13506300	13508300	because obviously my lore
13508300	13510300	was people had already
13510300	13513300	hypnotized themselves
13514300	13515300	to
13517300	13519300	be watching VTubers,
13519300	13521300	which was a quite like the...
13521300	13523300	the charisma
13523300	13525300	of the charisma.
13526300	13528300	We just turned everyone off.
13528300	13529300	It's that easy.
13530300	13532300	I think that A.C.
13532300	13534300	smart in gameplay capture
13534300	13536300	to different audiences.
13536300	13537300	Yes.
13537300	13538300	If you...
13538300	13540300	if you want to watch Immers,
13540300	13541300	my little Immers...
13542300	13543300	Wait a minute.
13545300	13547300	Wait, a diddly dying minute.
13549300	13551300	I think I need to perish those guys.
13551300	13552300	I don't know.
13552300	13554300	Maybe another time right now.
13554300	13555300	Let's just get there.
13557300	13558300	The Conqueror?
13558300	13560300	A.C. having a rough day?
13560300	13561300	Is she alright?
13563300	13566300	Oh, I can destroy these with my sword now.
13567300	13569300	Sorry, I'll just do some edging
13569300	13571300	on the grass.
13571300	13572300	If you didn't know that
13572300	13573300	is actually the terminology,
13573300	13574300	cheeky edging.
13574300	13576300	Wait, who...
13578300	13579300	Oh, I do have to defeat
13579300	13581300	the other guys right there.
13581300	13582300	Did I do it?
13582300	13584300	Am I going to come back to this area?
13584300	13585300	Probably not.
13586300	13587300	It is called A.C.I.N.
13587300	13588300	If you're a gardener,
13588300	13589300	it's called A.C.I.N.
13589300	13590300	That's called A.C.I.N.
13591300	13592300	Just a little...
13592300	13593300	no, literally like on the...
13593300	13595300	fortress of wind.
13596300	13597300	What is all...
13597300	13599300	Well, there's so many rooms
13599300	13600300	you can explore.
13602300	13604300	Okay, do not touch that.
13604300	13605300	Let's not do that again.
13607300	13608300	Hmm.
13608300	13609300	To think the rooms were hidden
13609300	13611300	within this cliff the whole time.
13611300	13612300	Watch your step, Link.
13612300	13614300	There may be traps in here.
13614300	13615300	Hmm.
13617300	13618300	Well, there might be traps here,
13618300	13619300	but what about the Fen Boys?
13619300	13620300	Okay, well...
13621300	13622300	I tried, I tried.
13622300	13623300	Geez.
13623300	13624300	Can't impress them all.
13627300	13628300	Hydration check.
13629300	13630300	Um...
13630300	13631300	Right, I will tell you
13631300	13632300	when Amy goes live
13632300	13633300	and YouTube mods you have
13633300	13634300	permission to talk
13634300	13635300	when Amy does go live.
13636300	13637300	Um...
13637300	13638300	And we will play...
13639300	13640300	Oh!
13641300	13642300	Oh, no, this can't be.
13643300	13644300	Oh, no, this can't be.
13645300	13646300	Oh, no, this can't be.
13646300	13647300	Oh, no, this can't be.
13647300	13648300	Oh, no, this can't be.
13648300	13649300	Oh, no, this can't be.
13650300	13651300	Oh, please don't touch me.
13657300	13658300	Wait.
13658300	13660300	So, what does the other lever do?
13663300	13664300	Jump on someone else's head.
13668300	13669300	Okay, there we go.
13671300	13672300	Okay, I'll take that.
13672300	13673300	Another keystone,
13673300	13674300	keystone.
13674300	13675300	Don't mind Father.
13676300	13677300	Oh!
13679300	13680300	Stop, please.
13681300	13682300	Sorry, a green chap.
13682300	13683300	Do you think Amy
13683300	13684300	has happen sizes?
13684300	13685300	No.
13686300	13688300	Whatever she does is completely
13688300	13689300	on her.
13689300	13691300	The girls make the content
13691300	13692300	they want to make.
13692300	13693300	They do what they want to do.
13693300	13695300	And that is the lovely
13695300	13696300	jiggly way we do it.
13697300	13698300	And...
13700300	13701300	An unnatural...
13702300	13703300	Well...
13703300	13704300	Ah!
13704300	13705300	I see what I have to do.
13706300	13707300	No!
13707300	13708300	I just got walloped
13708300	13709300	by freaking haunted skulls!
13711300	13712300	Fucking get up,
13712300	13713300	you lazybump.
13714300	13715300	I can't go that way.
13718300	13719300	You can deactivate those
13719300	13720300	electricity skulls
13720300	13721300	with a boomerang.
13721300	13722300	Oh, I never bought it.
13722300	13724300	It was 300 rupees.
13726300	13727300	I can't believe it.
13727300	13728300	Poverty strikes again.
13729300	13730300	I said get the tinfoil hat on
13730300	13731300	right now.
13733300	13734300	It's tiring.
13737300	13738300	Great.
13738300	13739300	Yes.
13739300	13740300	That would be the plan.
13740300	13741300	We'll play menace
13741300	13742300	for another cheeky two hours
13742300	13743300	because we're cheeky cheeky.
13744300	13745300	Also cheeky bricky.
13746300	13747300	And then
13747300	13748300	we shall...
13751300	13753300	do the forbidden members here.
13755300	13756300	And then that way
13756300	13757300	everyone's happy.
13758300	13759300	And everyone is happy.
13760300	13761300	Can I make everyone happy?
13761300	13762300	I don't know.
13762300	13764300	I sent from the Australians
13764300	13765300	because this is
13765300	13766300	probably the worst
13766300	13767300	time
13769300	13770300	we could have asked for.
13771300	13772300	A key!
13773300	13774300	Can I fall at the bottom
13774300	13775300	without taking fall damage?
13778300	13779300	Hmm.
13779300	13780300	Did someone just fall down
13780300	13781300	or was it my imagination?
13782300	13783300	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
13783300	13784300	Right.
13784300	13785300	Let's just take fall damage.
13786300	13787300	Speed things along a bit.
13788300	13789300	Emmy's going live now.
13789300	13790300	I don't know.
13792300	13793300	I knew...
13793300	13794300	I didn't know you could
13794300	13795300	do that with a boomerang
13795300	13796300	or something to do with a boomerang.
13798300	13799300	Hi.
13801300	13802300	What are you getting at?
13802300	13803300	Because I'm asked for showing up.
13803300	13804300	Wait, what's this?
13807300	13809300	Oh, there's so many stompers.
13810300	13811300	No, get away.
13811300	13812300	I'm no fighting you
13812300	13813300	as if you're just going to
13813300	13814300	keep respawning.
13816300	13817300	I don't have what...
13818300	13819300	That is so a rope snake.
13820300	13821300	I can tell.
13822300	13823300	No fall damage.
13823300	13824300	Nah.
13824300	13825300	Oh, these are happy.
13825300	13826300	Are they?
13827300	13828300	4am.
13830300	13832300	I guess it's maybe...
13833300	13834300	Oh, forget the stick.
13838300	13839300	Oh, I'm going to
13839300	13840300	freaking run out of health.
13840300	13841300	These don't have health.
13841300	13842300	Oh, for goodness.
13845300	13846300	I suck at this game.
13848300	13849300	But your mom swallows at it.
13855300	13856300	No.
13863300	13864300	Oh, no!
13864300	13865300	Did I?
13865300	13866300	Please tell me they're
13866300	13867300	not all going to respawn.
13868300	13869300	Okay, they didn't.
13869300	13870300	Thank goodness.
13871300	13872300	The one time where
13872300	13874300	clearing out stuff actually works.
13875300	13876300	I zoned back into that.
13877300	13878300	But don't zone out.
13878300	13879300	Are you going to...
13881300	13883300	Can I actually perish these guys?
13885300	13886300	Can I?
13887300	13888300	Oh, you can!
13889300	13890300	Wait, can I, like,
13890300	13891300	fully perish you then?
13895300	13896300	That was 2...
13896300	13897300	3...
13897300	13898300	4.
13898300	13899300	Okay.
13899300	13900300	I didn't even know that.
13901300	13902300	Hello.
13902300	13903300	Are you the compass?
13904300	13906300	You're the dungeon map split school.
13908300	13910300	Well, AC is really going through it now.
13910300	13911300	What?
13912300	13913300	Did I need to check the disc?
13915300	13916300	Did she tweak something?
13921300	13922300	Oh, no, she can't tweak.
13922300	13923300	She's got her can band.
13923300	13924300	One more.
13927300	13928300	Am I missing?
13929300	13930300	Yeah, she's got her can band.
13935300	13936300	My cat is not me on it,
13936300	13937300	so I better figure that out.
13940300	13941300	Oh, AC got it.
13942300	13943300	Damn.
13943300	13944300	Hold on, let me find her.
13946300	13947300	Oh, I follow so many girls.
13949300	13950300	Oh, Dr. Nova followed me back.
13950300	13951300	That was kind of her.
13952300	13953300	Hold on.
13955300	13957300	Is it, like, the Any End Stream?
13958300	13959300	Or...
13960300	13961300	I don't know.
13962300	13963300	I don't know.
13964300	13965300	I don't know.
13966300	13967300	I don't know.
13968300	13969300	I don't know.
13971300	13972300	I don't have the Discord account,
13973300	13974300	because I don't know anything.
13975300	13976300	She was showing me something.
13977300	13978300	Oh, it's just her filming.
13979300	13980300	Yeah.
13994300	13995300	I don't know.
14000300	14001300	Okay.
14010300	14011300	I think it's okay.
14014300	14015300	Okay, I think it's okay.
14015300	14016300	I think it's just...
14021300	14022300	Yeah.
14022300	14023300	Okay, I think it's...
14023300	14024300	All right.
14026300	14027300	The Uji-Sans will...
14027300	14029300	Oh, it looks like I'm moving on my health here.
14029300	14030300	The Uji-Sans will...
14034300	14036300	Gimli, I can hear you now.
14036300	14037300	Shut the fuck up.
14038300	14040300	There is not the time, darling.
14043300	14044300	Okay.
14045300	14046300	Phew, we barely made it.
14046300	14047300	I'm starting to run out of time.
14047300	14048300	I'm not trying.
14049300	14050300	I'm going to bed.
14050300	14051300	Oh, God, these are the hugger things.
14052300	14053300	Sorry, I might have to get Gimli in a minute.
14053300	14054300	She will not stop me on.
14057300	14058300	But I know...
14062300	14063300	He named your cat Gimli.
14064300	14065300	Am I going to call my cat Gimli?
14065300	14066300	So you're going to...
14067300	14068300	You're going to fart and clap?
14069300	14070300	Wait, no, that's not the same.
14070300	14072300	I think the same is like...
14072300	14073300	I'd rather...
14074300	14076300	go number two in my hands and clap
14076300	14077300	than do whatever...
14077300	14078300	or something fun.
14081300	14082300	It's a she, yes.
14084300	14085300	She's got a bit of ginger on her,
14085300	14086300	so I named her Gimli.
14088300	14089300	I know, so for you.
14091300	14092300	Ah, yes.
14092300	14093300	The floor masters,
14093300	14095300	or the masters, depending on you.
14097300	14099300	Just kind of go in here
14099300	14100300	and do something.
14101300	14102300	I don't know what,
14102300	14103300	but we're doing something anyway.
14106300	14107300	Wait, what?
14107300	14109300	Is that supposed to go somewhere?
14113300	14114300	Wait,
14114300	14115300	have I gone too far ahead?
14118300	14119300	I think I have.
14125300	14126300	Wait, have I gone too far ahead?
14128300	14129300	Have I done wrong?
14132300	14134300	I wouldn't mind getting a wee health bar.
14138300	14140300	I'm getting a wee cheeky heart.
14141300	14142300	I called my cat, baby.
14143300	14144300	Unlock the door.
14145300	14146300	I can't.
14146300	14147300	Oh, my God!
14150300	14151300	I'm not supposed to get killed for that.
14156300	14157300	Oh, no.
14157300	14158300	Close one.
14165300	14167300	Oh, I know, I know.
14167300	14168300	I comprehend, I comprehend.
14170300	14171300	No, don't.
14171300	14172300	Wait, what is this?
14172300	14173300	I don't know.
14174300	14175300	Oh, I need a zigzag.
14176300	14177300	Okay, I understand, I understand.
14177300	14178300	Sorry, it took me a...
14179300	14180300	a momento.
14180300	14181300	Right, if I do one there...
14183300	14185300	One, two, three, four, five.
14185300	14187300	Five, one, two, three, four, five.
14187300	14189300	Okay, up there and up there.
14189300	14190300	Right, okay, okay, okay.
14190300	14191300	Sorry, sorry.
14191300	14192300	It just takes me...
14192300	14194300	It takes me a moment to catch on.
14194300	14195300	It takes me a wee moment.
14195300	14196300	It's alright, it's alright, though.
14197300	14198300	It's alright.
14198300	14199300	It's alright.
14199300	14200300	We're here for doing it.
14200300	14201300	I don't need anybody.
14201300	14202300	I don't need anybody.
14202300	14203300	Um...
14204300	14207300	I was actually thinking of getting...
14209300	14210300	What's the game called?
14210300	14212300	Ah, that's exactly what I needed.
14212300	14214300	I was actually thinking of getting...
14216300	14218300	the buckshot roulette highlighted
14218300	14219300	just to show how dumb I am,
14219300	14221300	but like in a humorous way,
14221300	14222300	not like a...
14222300	14223300	you know, like pity party,
14223300	14226300	oh my gosh, who's brainless type of way.
14226300	14228300	And then I need to be small down here.
14230300	14231300	Okay, that looks correct.
14231300	14233300	It looks like I need to be small now.
14235300	14236300	And what is down here?
14236300	14238300	I'm curious.
14241300	14243300	If there's anything at all.
14244300	14246300	Amy just went live with brainwashing.
14249300	14251300	She has already got a warning,
14251300	14253300	so I'm nervous for that stream,
14253300	14254300	but hey, huh?
14254300	14255300	We're all adults here.
14257300	14258300	How'd I get up?
14258300	14259300	I can't use the stairs,
14259300	14260300	so I'll have to go all the way back
14260300	14262300	and shrink down an income.
14265300	14266300	I am getting very low health
14266300	14268300	and I don't like it,
14268300	14269300	and the game is currently refusing
14269300	14271300	to spawn one heart for me.
14271300	14272300	I do have a theory.
14276300	14278300	Yeah, I don't really need money right now.
14278300	14279300	I need a heart.
14279300	14281300	The game already needs a heart.
14282300	14284300	She's just following my misexample.
14285300	14286300	I just get so nervous.
14286300	14287300	I'm like, oh my god,
14287300	14288300	I wouldn't want them to jeopardize
14288300	14290300	their income or anything like that,
14290300	14292300	because YouTube makes up
14292300	14294300	such a big chunk of income.
14294300	14296300	As well as passive income,
14298300	14299300	because I almost made it.
14299300	14300300	I was going to go it,
14300300	14301300	but I don't have enough health
14301300	14302300	to be messing around.
14303300	14304300	But yes, Amy is live
14304300	14305300	for any pinpals
14305300	14307300	who are wanting
14307300	14310300	the tingly ASMR experience.
14310300	14312300	Please do check it out.
14312300	14313300	Um...
14315300	14316300	Um...
14316300	14318300	What happened from here?
14319300	14320300	Um...
14320300	14322300	I'm just a bit of an irritant, okay?
14323300	14324300	What did those do?
14330300	14331300	Right.
14333300	14334300	Again, my question is,
14334300	14335300	what did those do?
14337300	14338300	I dropped a key
14338300	14340300	that I can't get access to.
14341300	14342300	Ray...
14344300	14345300	Right, if I want to become big,
14345300	14347300	I can take a shortcut this way.
14348300	14350300	I am missing an item,
14350300	14352300	and I've gone the wrong way.
14356300	14358300	Okay, I've definitely missed an item,
14358300	14359300	because...
14365300	14366300	What was here?
14367300	14369300	Again, I need an item.
14369300	14370300	Right.
14370300	14371300	There must be another way.
14374300	14375300	Top ten times
14375300	14376300	Pastrani
14376300	14377300	shot herself with a shot
14377300	14379300	that I didn't believe number four.
14379300	14380300	What?!
14384300	14385300	Would you prefer to be punned
14385300	14387300	with Pastrami or something?
14387300	14389300	Friggin' Azura's accent is so funny.
14389300	14390300	She calls me Strani.
14392300	14393300	And I'm like,
14393300	14395300	are you calling me Minestrani Sue?
14395300	14397300	But it's just the way she says it.
14397300	14398300	Okay, this is exactly
14398300	14399300	what I needed.
14399300	14400300	This friggin' room right here.
14400300	14401300	Give me the heart.
14402300	14403300	She's a Gastroni,
14403300	14404300	and I'm like...
14405300	14406300	Oh my God, Azura.
14407300	14409300	I literally sound like Minestrani Sue!
14411300	14412300	That's very cute.
14412300	14413300	I like it.
14419300	14420300	That looks like Archery,
14420300	14422300	if I've ever seen something like that.
14422300	14424300	Yeah, and it gives you five in a...
14426300	14427300	Okay.
14427300	14429300	We will get the super secret item.
14433300	14435300	Right, I'm just gonna take the HP damage
14435300	14437300	because I know there's infinite heals.
14439300	14440300	Oh!
14440300	14442300	Do we have Invis frames when we spray?
14443300	14444300	One of them is a rope.
14447300	14448300	Yeah, fuck me.
14449300	14451300	Damn right, give me that coin.
14451300	14453300	Right, where is that electoral thing?
14455300	14456300	Is it the red one?
14460300	14461300	It is.
14465300	14466300	See, you can get me to this.
14466300	14467300	You got me before,
14467300	14468300	but you'll never get me again.
14472300	14474300	Azura's been absolutely killing it
14474300	14475300	on the Star Jew.
14475300	14476300	She is a dick.
14476300	14477300	It's eight.
14480300	14481300	What is this?
14485300	14486300	Oh!
14486300	14487300	True.
14487300	14489300	Oh, I need to go on that platform.
14490300	14492300	Oh, I need to do a little cheeky trickshot.
14493300	14494300	Oh, I missed.
14496300	14497300	Hey!
14500300	14501300	And then...
14505300	14506300	There we go.
14506300	14508300	Both sides are open, that's why I like to...
14512300	14513300	Yeah, see,
14513300	14515300	imagine if you drop more hearts consistently.
14515300	14517300	How easy would this game be?
14517300	14518300	But no, no.
14524300	14525300	If I push that,
14526300	14527300	doesn't that block me?
14531300	14533300	I'm a bit too scared to touch anything
14533300	14535300	in this room...
14535300	14537300	unless I'm going crazy.
14538300	14541300	She said she has, like, two key arrows in it.
14543300	14544300	That is...
14545300	14547300	Am I going mental or is that just going to block me?
14560300	14561300	However,
14561300	14563300	I think I dropped down onto it instead
14563300	14565300	because that doesn't seem right at all.
14566300	14568300	I'm actually losing that...
14569300	14570300	Game!
14570300	14572300	You knew exactly what I was trying to achieve.
14574300	14575300	Okay, let's go.
14582300	14584300	Well, I assume this is going to turn them on.
14585300	14586300	Hmm, gee Wilkers,
14586300	14589300	I wonder if standing on these buttons in this room full of two enemies
14589300	14591300	is going to activate enemies?
14591300	14592300	Surely it's a mystery.
14592300	14593300	Truly.
14593300	14594300	Truly a mystery.
14596300	14597300	I'm not stuck.
14598300	14599300	Oh, I missed.
14599300	14600300	Okay, now he's looking at me.
14601300	14602300	Wah!
14604300	14605300	I missed.
14607300	14608300	Right in your eyeball, bruv.
14611300	14612300	Ta-da!
14617300	14618300	No, wait, you got it.
14619300	14620300	Compass!
14622300	14623300	The heart's in here.
14623300	14625300	You know, there's ammo, though.
14628300	14630300	I'm full ammo, I didn't even get it.
14631300	14633300	It's correct, no push up.
14634300	14636300	Pegasus boots across the gap, no push up.
14638300	14639300	He gets trolling.
14639300	14642300	I'm pretty sure I have to drop down and it's a troll.
14644300	14646300	Nintendo are very trolly,
14646300	14649300	but this does not seem correct at all.
14649300	14651300	I think we dropped down.
14651300	14653300	I want to say we dropped down because...
14654300	14656300	Yeah, this doesn't look right.
14656300	14657300	Push!
14657300	14658300	Push!
14658300	14659300	I can only push.
14659300	14660300	I can only push again.
14661300	14662300	And then I can only push again.
14662300	14663300	I don't have a choice.
14663300	14665300	Like, I can push that back.
14665300	14666300	That doesn't do anything.
14666300	14667300	Oh, push it up!
14667300	14669300	Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
14669300	14671300	I'm so sorry.
14671300	14672300	I'm so...
14673300	14677300	Like, if I can't see the solution, then it doesn't work.
14677300	14678300	You know what I mean?
14678300	14679300	I'm so sorry.
14679300	14682300	The reason why you push it that way is so you can do them horizontal.
14682300	14683300	I apologize.
14683300	14686300	Literally never played this, so I can't offer any advice.
14686300	14689300	Well, I'm pretty sure you probably called out though.
14689300	14691300	I am so sorry.
14691300	14694300	Oh my god, I must be painful watching me do anything.
14696300	14697300	Okay, we have a key.
14697300	14698300	Let's go grab it.
14699300	14701300	Yeah, we're just going to go back down again.
14701300	14703300	You're so adorable.
14703300	14704300	Isn't it not frustrating though?
14704300	14707300	I feel like it'd be frustrating watching someone being like,
14707300	14708300	No, that's impossible.
14708300	14710300	And the solution is literally right there.
14711300	14712300	I feel like...
14717300	14719300	I get it, I get it.
14719300	14722300	Right, we finally have the second key, so we can just come up here
14722300	14724300	and go straight into the...
14724300	14726300	We would watch you...
14726300	14727300	Oh, this reset.
14727300	14729300	Oh, but I didn't reset those guys.
14730300	14732300	Watch paint dry.
14733300	14734300	Right.
14734300	14736300	Let's just do this.
14736300	14737300	Steady.
14737300	14738300	Easy. Steady.
14738300	14740300	Whoa, you've never seen anyone move faster.
14742300	14744300	Are these going to vibrate?
14744300	14745300	No.
14746300	14747300	Whoa.
14748300	14749300	Naughty.
14750300	14752300	Oh wait, that's like the enemies in Isaac as well.
14753300	14756300	He wasn't kidding when you said this game was inspired by it.
14757300	14758300	Oh, fight room, fight room.
14762300	14765300	It always scares other way, Link.
14765300	14766300	Jeez.
14770300	14772300	Okay, he needs to attack,
14772300	14774300	and then I can wallop his chest.
14775300	14776300	Wallop.
14777300	14778300	Wallop.
14779300	14780300	Wallop.
14780300	14781300	Oh, I missed.
14785300	14786300	Ah, there we go.
14786300	14788300	Take yourself out, mate, you suck.
14788300	14792300	Oh, we're already halfway through the dungeon, so just unlock the portal.
14793300	14794300	Okay, yeah.
14795300	14799300	Just a reminder to anyone that wants to watch ASMR,
14799300	14804300	Amy Bezu is live, her link is in the description down below.
14805300	14807300	Everyone's link is actually in my description.
14807300	14810300	Go subscribe to everyone, and go watch their shorts.
14810300	14813300	I spend money on their shorts, so please watch them.
14813300	14815300	Please watch them, please help the girls.
14816300	14820300	Actually, big news that I completely forgot to mention,
14820300	14824300	Sheeby is going balls to the wall.
14825300	14827300	She's full-time now, I feel her.
14828300	14831300	She had a job, on every hand, and she's full-time now.
14831300	14832300	Feels good now.
14833300	14836300	So definitely don't be afraid to sign up for the girls' picture-
14836300	14839300	Oh, that's what I was saying before I interrupted myself.
14841300	14842300	Because someone-
14842300	14843300	Ah, piss!
14843300	14844300	My rupees are full.
14847300	14852300	I didn't see a bag at that shot to increase my rupees.
14854300	14856300	Yeah, she quit, she's now full-time.
14856300	14857300	Yeah.
14860300	14863300	Oh, that's just how I progressed.
14865300	14866300	Yeah, she's full-time.
14866300	14868300	Definitely don't be afraid to support the girls I'm pretty on.
14868300	14872300	As I was saying, when I was mentioning that the game is free,
14877300	14879300	I was talking about people being like,
14879300	14883300	I only have five dollars to support.
14883300	14885300	I feel so bad it's not enough.
14887300	14891300	So, what's the word?
14892300	14894300	It comes together.
14896300	14900300	So you give five bucks, and then someone with your mentality gives five bucks,
14900300	14902300	and then someone goes on and on and on.
14902300	14904300	And that money adds up over time.
14905300	14906300	It's kind of like-
14906300	14909300	I don't know if you've ever heard of the OF Rhetoric where it's like,
14909300	14914300	Oh, you sell your do-do-do-do for pennies type thing.
14914300	14916300	But it adds up, though.
14916300	14919300	You don't need to charge 70 or four.
14919300	14921300	It's just not needed.
14923300	14925300	I'm going to get an exact-
14925300	14926300	I'm going to get-
14926300	14928300	Please let me out, jeez.
14929300	14931300	Wait, where'd I go with Keto?
14932300	14934300	But it all adds up and it adds to their income,
14934300	14936300	and it's stable income as well.
14936300	14938300	As long as I have told the girls,
14938300	14940300	I've been very serious with them.
14940300	14942300	Am I going to get-
14942300	14943300	Am I going to get touched?
14943300	14945300	I've been not in the business.
14946300	14951300	I have told them, like, it's of your utmost importance to give me these audios in time,
14951300	14953300	because if we have to pause your Patreon income,
14953300	14956300	then it's probably you're gonna be-
14956300	14958300	There's no point in picking up rupees.
14958300	14961300	Of course I get a red and two blues,
14961300	14964300	literally 30 rupees in one pop when I'm like full.
14965300	14966300	What are these guys?
14966300	14967300	How do I hurt them?
14967300	14969300	I'll just spam them in the corner.
14969300	14971300	Money compounds, yes, basically.
14971300	14972300	Can you come here?
14973300	14975300	Is that four hits, jeez.
14976300	14979300	Yeah, yeah, of course I get tons of money now.
14979300	14981300	In game.
14981300	14983300	Wah!
14986300	14988300	Nah, Sam's just skipping.
14988300	14990300	If you're not coming towards me, I'm skipping.
14990300	14992300	Ah, piss, left or right.
14993300	14994300	Left or right.
14994300	14996300	Whoever types left or right, I'll do your first-
14996300	14998300	Do your first saying.
14998300	15000300	Don't blow it yourself or not, then eat and come on through.
15000300	15002300	Don't be meanly, literally.
15002300	15004300	Alright, first one said left.
15012300	15014300	Mods, execute that man.
15015300	15017300	Left or right.
15017300	15019300	Left or right.
15022300	15023300	Left or right.
15023300	15025300	No, you know what?
15025300	15026300	You know what?
15026300	15027300	I'll do it myself.
15027300	15028300	I'm gonna time you out,
15028300	15029300	for giving me the wrong say-
15029300	15031300	I'm not even kidding, I'm timing you out,
15031300	15033300	because you gave me the wrong say to go on.
15033300	15036300	You will be timed out for a whole,
15036300	15038300	a whole minute.
15038300	15041300	For your, your dissatisfaction.
15041300	15043300	Where are you?
15043300	15044300	No!
15044300	15046300	Where is it?
15046300	15048300	Wait, I need to time them out.
15048300	15049300	I need to time them out.
15049300	15051300	Put user in time out.
15051300	15052300	Who was it?
15052300	15054300	Right, put user in time out.
15054300	15057300	For ten seconds, confirm.
15057300	15060300	There, you've been timed out for ten seconds.
15060300	15062300	Take that time out.
15062300	15064300	Your insolence towards the cause
15064300	15066300	will not be forgotten.
15067300	15069300	Don't ever cook again.
15069300	15070300	Teasing you.
15070300	15071300	So cruel.
15071300	15072300	One whole minute of no-
15072300	15074300	No, I said ten seconds.
15074300	15075300	I said ten seconds.
15075300	15077300	Is he back?
15077300	15078300	I'm gonna start panicking,
15078300	15080300	if a mod actually did ban you for real though.
15080300	15082300	Mods, whenever I say ban this man,
15082300	15084300	I mean in humorous way.
15084300	15087300	Where the heck is the dungeon thing?
15087300	15088300	Based AF.
15088300	15089300	Oh no, there you are.
15089300	15090300	Guys, it hurts.
15090300	15092300	Yeah, okay, he's back, he's back.
15092300	15095300	Right, where was the dungeon entrance?
15095300	15098300	I actually don't recall seeing the dungeon entrance.
15098300	15101300	Is it back this way?
15101300	15103300	Oh, they're dancing.
15103300	15104300	Oh, it must be this way.
15104300	15106300	Yeah, surely, surely.
15111300	15112300	Check them out.
15112300	15114300	Personal attention.
15114300	15115300	Refling.
15115300	15117300	This should have been me.
15117300	15118300	No, it shouldn't,
15118300	15120300	because you get timed out for doing that.
15120300	15122300	Wait, I'm gonna do it.
15122300	15123300	The chest spawns there,
15123300	15125300	not the statue has to go there.
15125300	15127300	Me making my thingy.
15127300	15128300	Doomsdaydan,
15128300	15129300	what if I wanna pay for it though?
15129300	15131300	I never read out your name.
15131300	15134300	God, it must be really weird
15134300	15136300	when I don't read out your name when you don't know,
15136300	15138300	and then 15 minutes later,
15138300	15140300	I'm like, oh my god,
15141300	15142300	Oh my god, Duly Lover,
15142300	15143300	thank you so much,
15143300	15145300	because I keep forgetting.
15150300	15152300	I wouldn't mind getting a full heal.
15152300	15154300	Do you have hearts?
15154300	15156300	Yeah, that's what I like to see.
15156300	15157300	That's what I like to see,
15157300	15158300	a video game that's stocked up.
15158300	15160300	Right, we're ready.
15161300	15163300	How long are you going today?
15163300	15166300	We have T-minus less than two hours,
15166300	15169300	and then we will continue
15169300	15171300	our Zelda shenanigans tomorrow.
15175300	15176300	I don't feel that.
15176300	15178300	I don't feel everything, honestly.
15192300	15195300	Shoot his hands with an arrow?
15195300	15196300	That looks correct,
15196300	15198300	so let's do that.
15198300	15200300	Oh, okay, let's not do that.
15200300	15203300	Oh, okay, let's just completely miss.
15209300	15211300	Ah, let me go, let me go.
15211300	15213300	I'm just a tiny boy from the pool.
15213300	15215300	Whoa, he took so much health.
15215300	15218300	That is an insane amount of health he just took.
15218300	15220300	Am I supposed to have more health by this?
15220300	15222300	I think I might need to do more side quests
15222300	15223300	than after this.
15223300	15226300	He took so much health in that.
15226300	15228300	Oh my god, oh my god.
15229300	15231300	He's got a little thing on his nose.
15231300	15233300	Oh god, what happens in here?
15238300	15240300	Oh, okay, we did it, we did it.
15240300	15241300	We're being extracted.
15241300	15242300	Any extractors?
15242300	15244300	Me, me, I'm being extracted.
15246300	15249300	Why did you take so much health though?
15250300	15251300	Oh.
15254300	15257300	Can you drop a heart maybe instead of arrows?
15257300	15258300	That'd be great.
15265300	15267300	I'm totally not strawwetting right now.
15267300	15269300	I'm getting a bit nervous.
15269300	15272300	Oh, what, there?
15272300	15274300	It's not that one, it has to be...
15274300	15276300	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
15277300	15278300	I can't do any harder.
15278300	15279300	I can't do any harder.
15279300	15280300	Alright, again, extracted.
15280300	15282300	It's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
15282300	15284300	We're gonna do it, we're gonna do it.
15284300	15285300	What's that?
15285300	15286300	I'm low health.
15286300	15288300	It's fine though.
15288300	15289300	Ow!
15289300	15291300	Alright, I said we're dropping the fairy.
15291300	15292300	Bring the fairy in.
15292300	15294300	Ring the guards, ring the guards.
15294300	15296300	The guards have been rang.
15299300	15301300	Oh my god, I'm like spamming so hard when I do that.
15301300	15303300	I'm not even kidding.
15304300	15305300	Can we do it?
15305300	15306300	Can we do it?
15306300	15308300	Can we do it in this perfect three or are we gonna have to do it again?
15308300	15310300	Because I don't have any more heals.
15310300	15312300	I don't have any more heals, bro.
15312300	15313300	Wait!
15313300	15314300	What are you doing?
15314300	15316300	Link!
15316300	15318300	Link, you're stressing me out.
15318300	15319300	We're under a timer here.
15319300	15321300	This guy doesn't stay down forever.
15321300	15323300	Sorry, sorry.
15323300	15325300	Ugh.
15325300	15327300	No!
15327300	15329300	Ugh.
15329300	15331300	Oh, we're gonna get extracted before we even...
15331300	15333300	Done a lick of damage!
15333300	15334300	No!
15334300	15336300	This is why I don't gamble!
15337300	15339300	This is why I don't gamble!
15339300	15341300	Oh, we did it.
15341300	15343300	Oh, we did it.
15343300	15345300	Don't gamble, home kids.
15346300	15348300	This is why we don't gamble.
15349300	15352300	Let's go free in a row.
15352300	15354300	And a healthup.
15354300	15356300	I don't know why I just turned Russian there.
15356300	15357300	A healthup.
15357300	15358300	Okay, we got healed up.
15358300	15360300	Now we go upstairs.
15361300	15365300	Oh my god, it's Gami's colourful family.
15365300	15366300	Hello.
15366300	15367300	Check.
15367300	15370300	We are the tribe of the winds.
15370300	15373300	Long have we lived with the winds.
15373300	15374300	We have mastered them.
15374300	15378300	Now we join them together with the great winds at our backs.
15378300	15379300	We head for the skies.
15379300	15384300	Those who come seeking our power must play the note Zafa teachers.
15384300	15386300	Zafa teachers.
15386300	15389300	May they lead you onward to the power that you seek.
15390300	15391300	Aw.
15391300	15394300	You got the ocarina of the winds.
15394300	15398300	North, south, east and west, they're all just a breath away.
15400300	15403300	I do believe this is where the tribe of the winds once lived.
15403300	15404300	Hmm.
15404300	15408300	So they've left for the heavens and taken their element with them.
15408300	15413300	It looks like the wind element is beyond our reach for the time being.
15413300	15415300	We have no choice but to press on.
15415300	15417300	Let's get out of here.
15418300	15422300	So we did all of that for fucking nothing.
15422300	15426300	The element was not here, but at least we now have a clue to its whereabouts.
15426300	15429300	You must use the ocarina of wind to open a new path.
15429300	15432300	Well, there's no point in standing around.
15432300	15434300	Get that last element.
15434300	15436300	Last element.
15436300	15438300	We only have two.
15448300	15450300	Are we?
15453300	15456300	Um, are we supposed to go to the graveyard now?
15459300	15460300	Yes.
15462300	15466300	Ah, so that mysterious mark we've been seeing is the crest wind.
15466300	15470300	If you play the ocarina of wind, Zafa comes to pick you up and fly away.
15470300	15474300	That means we can have Zafa carry us to any other wind crest that we've seen.
15475300	15477300	Are you following me, Link?
15477300	15479300	Don't hurt your brain thinking about it.
15479300	15482300	Just give it a try and you'll see what I'm talking about.
15485300	15486300	That's just the map from...
15486300	15488300	That's just the map from a link to the past.
15488300	15490300	Is that actually?
15490300	15492300	Right, no?
15495300	15497300	Do you wonder what's going on?
15497300	15499300	I wonder what's going on too.
15500300	15503300	Uh, right.
15503300	15505300	We never actually...
15505300	15507300	Hello?
15507300	15508300	Stamp, stamp.
15508300	15510300	Even if we hire more people.
15510300	15511300	Welcome.
15511300	15513300	I'm selling issues of a helpful, adventurous guide.
15513300	15516300	It's called The Swordsman's News, and it's full of device right now.
15516300	15517300	You can buy the latest issue.
15517300	15518300	It's only 200.
15518300	15519300	200?
15519300	15522300	That's extortionate for a piece of paper and a bit of ink, mate.
15522300	15526300	I'm not lying, but that's a bit much, don't you think?
15526300	15528300	I'm going to see if we can get a bigger...
15530300	15533300	A bigger money pouch.
15536300	15538300	Use the Ocarina to fly to the lake.
15540300	15541300	Ice temple.
15541300	15542300	Oh, you're right.
15542300	15543300	Ice temple.
15545300	15546300	Wow.
15547300	15548300	Money, money, money.
15548300	15549300	Oh, wonderful.
15549300	15550300	They fit.
15550300	15551300	I'm so happy.
15557300	15561300	Oh, I can just keep using these guys over and over again.
15563300	15564300	I've got two red.
15564300	15566300	I assume red is like a major math update.
15569300	15571300	Okay, money pouch.
15572300	15573300	Total.
15573300	15575300	It's a golden total.
15575300	15576300	I like totals.
15577300	15579300	Gears, the sh...
15579300	15581300	Oh, the arcade's open.
15581300	15582300	What happened to the arcade?
15586300	15587300	Netto?
15588300	15591300	I can buy a bigger quiver?
15592300	15593300	I don't know.
15594300	15596300	I'll buy the boomerang.
15597300	15601300	That boomerang is not a bargain, but I'll take it since I need it.
15601300	15602300	Yeah, you're...
15603300	15605300	Well, you're a big spender.
15605300	15608300	Wait, does the boomerang get replaced by a money pouch?
15610300	15612300	How much is the money pouch?
15613300	15614300	600?
15615300	15616300	Eh?
15619300	15620300	What about you?
15621300	15623300	I don't have this kind of money.
15623300	15625300	I can't even hold it on my persons.
15626300	15628300	Jeez, you're extortionate, mate.
15628300	15629300	I'm a child.
15630300	15632300	Surely I get some discount.
15633300	15635300	I want to play games too.
15635300	15636300	What's in here?
15637300	15638300	What do you do?
15638300	15639300	Ah, he's finally open.
15639300	15641300	I can't wait to get cracking.
15641300	15642300	I don't know what this is.
15642300	15644300	That's like four languages.
15644300	15645300	What are these inflation rates?
15645300	15647300	Yeah, real child labor.
15647300	15648300	Speak.
15648300	15649300	Oh no, a customer.
15649300	15651300	Why did I even start a treasure game shop anyway?
15651300	15652300	Alright then.
15652300	15655300	Well, welcome to the fascinating world of treasure, blah blah blah.
15655300	15658300	In this wonderland, you can test your luck and win big bucks, maybe.
15658300	15660300	I don't really recommend it myself, however.
15660300	15661300	It's your wallet.
15661300	15663300	It's 10 rupees for a try.
15663300	15665300	I don't even have that money.
15666300	15668300	I fell over because I don't have the money.
15668300	15669300	Oh, good, good.
15669300	15670300	It really is your lucky day.
15670300	15671300	You don't have enough rupees.
15671300	15674300	I'm telling you, this gambling nonsense is no good.
15674300	15676300	You're better off without it.
15676300	15680300	Wait, Nintendo kind of pitching the masses, huh?
15680300	15681300	Right.
15683300	15687300	Can I learn a new move because I can do this?
15688300	15690300	Come again when you can jump further than any other.
15690300	15691300	Okay, my bad.
15691300	15693300	It doesn't have 10 bucks, could you glad?
15693300	15698300	If you aren't playing on a Game Boy, you can scam this game?
15701300	15704300	Now, the implications of that just don't work.
15707300	15708300	I don't...
15708300	15710300	No, this isn't where I'm supposed to go.
15711300	15714300	Even though I'm supposed to technically make my way to the air temple.
15714300	15715300	Oh, goodness.
15715300	15716300	Yay, okay, right.
15716300	15718300	I'm not supposed to be here yet.
15718300	15722300	We will now go top right, but not too top right.
15722300	15723300	Like middle right.
15723300	15724300	How about that?
15724300	15725300	We do middle right.
15725300	15726300	Deal.
15726300	15727300	We now have Pegasus boots.
15727300	15728300	What is that?
15729300	15733300	I don't know what that changes over here if we have access to Pegasus boots though.
15734300	15737300	Oh, I just fucking ruled them.
15738300	15739300	Fucking hell.
15739300	15740300	Fucking hell.
15740300	15742300	There's too much going on here.
15742300	15743300	I can't handle it.
15743300	15744300	I'm getting ruled.
15744300	15745300	I'm getting ruled.
15745300	15747300	Jeez, would you perish already?
15748300	15750300	Gosh, galley.
15752300	15754300	Jeez, I'm getting absolutely obliterated.
15754300	15756300	I think you can use a Steve Star.
15756300	15759300	You can scan the game by saving and checking and loading and clicking right.
15759300	15761300	Wow, I didn't know that.
15763300	15766300	I feel like there's something I must have access to.
15768300	15769300	This?
15769300	15770300	Oh, this looks okay.
15773300	15775300	Reach go a little to the right.
15775300	15776300	Oh.
15777300	15778300	Or not.
15781300	15783300	Oh, a new fairy.
15783300	15784300	Hello.
15784300	15785300	Hello.
15785300	15786300	I'm Link.
15787300	15790300	And I'd like to link up with you, baby girl.
15791300	15792300	Hi.
15793300	15794300	Wow.
15794300	15796300	Welcome to the adventure spring.
15796300	15798300	I have need of many rupees.
15798300	15800300	Please throw all of yours into the spring.
15800300	15801300	Sure.
15801300	15802300	All yours.
15802300	15803300	I don't need it.
15803300	15804300	Really?
15804300	15806300	You know, I don't even have one rupee on my person.
15806300	15807300	You know that.
15807300	15809300	If you do this, you will have absolutely no rupees left, right?
15809300	15811300	Will you really throw them all in?
15811300	15812300	Yes.
15812300	15814300	You are most kind.
15814300	15816300	I do not really need your rupees,
15816300	15819300	but I must reward such a kind adventure with some of my power.
15820300	15821300	You got a big wallet.
15824300	15826300	Complain and you shall receive.
15826300	15828300	May light shine on your quest.
15829300	15831300	May light shine on your quest.
15831300	15833300	Complain and you shall receive.
15833300	15835300	I got exactly what I wanted.
15838300	15840300	Wallet upgrade.
15840300	15842300	Don't mind if I do.
15842300	15844300	Literally exactly what I was needing.
15846300	15847300	Sorry.
15847300	15849300	I'm going to have to get like Gimli in this room.
15849300	15851300	Because she's going to absolutely hate shit.
15853300	15854300	Sorry.
15854300	15856300	I need to get rid of the plastic in the room, girl.
15856300	15858300	Because she'll chew the plastic.
15858300	15860300	Won't you get more?
15865300	15867300	I can chew the room, Gimli.
15868300	15870300	Then I'll put it in.
15871300	15873300	No, there'll be inside by the money.
15874300	15876300	I'll be coming right now.
15876300	15877300	Sorry.
15878300	15879300	Oh, and now I'll open the door
15879300	15880300	all the time.
15880300	15882300	She'll be interested when we're coming in.
15883300	15885300	I'm getting out of here.
15887300	15888300	Why are you here?
15888300	15889300	I need to go.
15891300	15892300	Come on.
15892300	15894300	You need to push through the door.
15895300	15896300	Oh, hold on.
15896300	15898300	I'm going to open the back gate.
15898300	15900300	Garden 4, I'll be back for a sec.
15924300	15925300	Sorry.
15954300	15956300	See these cats, man.
15956300	15958300	See these cats.
15960300	15961300	Oh.
15961300	15962300	She's coming out of me.
15962300	15963300	Oh, do you want out?
15963300	15964300	No, do you want...
15964300	15965300	What do you want?
15965300	15966300	I've already fed you.
15966300	15968300	Obviously she wants treats.
15969300	15972300	So, I'm now reinforcing that behaviour
15972300	15974300	for her to come me out and annoy me.
15974300	15975300	So, she's not looking good.
15975300	15976300	She's not looking good.
15976300	15977300	She's not looking good.
15977300	15979300	So, I'm now reinforcing that behaviour
15979300	15981300	for her to come me out and annoy me.
15981300	15983300	So, she's not looking good.
15983300	15984300	She's not looking good.
15984300	15986300	Do you want to do pin stones?
15986300	15987300	No?
15987300	15988300	Oh, wait a minute.
15988300	15990300	We have the mitts.
15990300	15991300	No, we can do this.
15992300	15993300	Fuck.
15998300	16000300	That's just the money.
16001300	16004300	No, the game knows I'm too scared.
16007300	16008300	Well, there you go.
16008300	16011300	To keep out money for doing a wee bit of exploring.
16012300	16014300	Stranny new.
16014300	16015300	What?
16015300	16016300	What does it do?
16020300	16023300	Oh, she's going to start me on a hell of a lot more now.
16023300	16024300	Oh, well.
16025300	16026300	She...
16026300	16028300	Honestly, you can spoil a cat.
16028300	16029300	What's the worst of him?
16029300	16030300	Is it me?
16030300	16031300	I was a bit more...
16031300	16032300	There's none of them.
16032300	16033300	It's up or down.
16033300	16034300	I think I may actually be up.
16034300	16035300	You know what?
16035300	16036300	This way to the lake.
16036300	16037300	So, what's up?
16038300	16039300	Shhh.
16040300	16042300	Aw, I'm going the wrong way.
16043300	16046300	Mmm, I may have gone the wrong way.
16047300	16049300	I am going the wrong way.
16049300	16051300	I'm going to have to go all the way on.
16053300	16055300	Cats deserve all the treats.
16056300	16058300	I didn't mean to spoil them.
16058300	16059300	Weed gimmels.
16059300	16060300	Or we go.
16061300	16063300	My cat doesn't stop me at one.
16063300	16066300	Literally, I don't know how much you could hear
16066300	16069300	because I was away from the microphone and, like, standing at the door.
16069300	16071300	I was like, right, come in then.
16071300	16072300	Come in then, you win.
16072300	16073300	Come in.
16073300	16075300	And then she's looking at me like...
16076300	16077300	I'm like...
16078300	16079300	Bruv, you've literally won.
16079300	16080300	Wait.
16080300	16081300	No!
16081300	16083300	I thought I unlocked the shortcut there.
16083300	16084300	Oh, there it is.
16084300	16085300	There it is.
16085300	16086300	Okay, we're on the right track.
16087300	16089300	That ace thing, if you noticed it.
16089300	16090300	Whoa, whose house is this?
16091300	16093300	Oh, Tiddly Wings.
16093300	16094300	Let me dug here.
16094300	16096300	Oh, how's it going, wee man?
16096300	16097300	Rough, rough.
16097300	16098300	Oh, great.
16098300	16099300	Can I go talk to it?
16099300	16101300	You're right there, mate.
16101300	16104300	My master, Sokwell, has been coming home far too late to play with me.
16104300	16105300	I'm so lonely.
16105300	16107300	Okay, let's fuse these two.
16109300	16113300	Guys, I'm still recovering from the time that I forgot what duration was left.
16113300	16114300	My cat doesn't...
16118300	16120300	Minish Village?
16122300	16123300	No, not Minish Village.
16125300	16127300	Thanks for that, Tiddly Wings.
16127300	16128300	For that, we just...
16128300	16129300	Let me just find...
16136300	16137300	Can I run on water?
16138300	16139300	I don't think I can.
16140300	16141300	No, I can't.
16149300	16152300	The mayor's secret house, maybe?
16154300	16156300	I can't believe I forgot to freaking do that.
16156300	16157300	You know that?
16157300	16159300	Right, I'll remember this for now.
16162300	16163300	However...
16164300	16165300	Where the heck?
16166300	16168300	I'm a bit confuzzled.
16169300	16171300	No, you need to keep...
16171300	16174300	Left is the one that's not right, I think.
16174300	16175300	Now you go back down.
16175300	16177300	Right, I think maybe...
16177300	16179300	Is this the library quest yet?
16179300	16183300	I think the library quest is what needs to happen next.
16185300	16186300	Oh, sorry.
16186300	16187300	My apologies.
16187300	16189300	Oh, there's a staircase down there.
16192300	16196300	That mustache-y old guy strikes me somewhat unreliable.
16196300	16199300	There's something fishy about this room, too.
16202300	16205300	I hope I don't sound like I'm bragging, but I have a certain cabin in Lake.
16205300	16207300	It's a gorgeous little place where I go to enjoy my hot...
16207300	16209300	Okay, I think that's the hint.
16209300	16210300	You want to fuse?
16210300	16211300	Yes, I want to fuse.
16214300	16215300	Can I run on water?
16215300	16217300	Jesus, girl, confirm Gen 2.
16217300	16222300	Oh, your name's not Stroneys Remove Tornail, bro.
16224300	16227300	No way you called yourself that.
16228300	16229300	Holy sh...
16232300	16234300	Oh, my God.
16234300	16235300	Brutal.
16237300	16238300	Absolutely brutal.
16241300	16242300	The pick?
16242300	16244300	Is that my foot?
16245300	16247300	Is that a picture of my toe?
16249300	16252300	Have you got a picture of my toe as your profile picture?
16255300	16257300	No way.
16257300	16259300	That's funny as fuck.
16261300	16263300	That's amazing.
16265300	16268300	Yeah, I would talk about the experience.
16268300	16271300	This person loving here is the mayor, very important.
16271300	16274300	Doesn't it just sound also official?
16274300	16277300	The mayor, like, strange mask sometimes even makes his own.
16277300	16279300	There's a mayor evil.
16281300	16284300	Just for a week, okay, okay, okay.
16284300	16287300	I would talk about, like, what happened in that,
16287300	16291300	but if I'm going to be honest, it was pretty, like...
16292300	16295300	A rough experience, so I'd rather just...
16295300	16296300	It's TFE.
16296300	16299300	Oh, you about it, because I had a bad time.
16301300	16303300	But I'm okay, so you don't have to worry.
16303300	16307300	No doom, no doom, but it was pretty...
16307300	16308300	Not nice.
16308300	16310300	So I don't really want to talk about it.
16312300	16314300	Right, I think the cabin in the lake was a hint.
16314300	16316300	There's no way it was.
16316300	16319300	Under construction, digging, prohibited.
16319300	16321300	Oh, yeah? What are you going to do if I do this, then?
16321300	16323300	Yeah, you're going to fart and clap.
16327300	16332300	The bandage gets changed, I guess, technically, after this room.
16333300	16335300	There's, like, a chest here.
16336300	16338300	Ah, I'm actually so smart.
16338300	16340300	I'm, like, 10 out of 10 smart.
16341300	16343300	There's a spider there.
16343300	16345300	He humped me!
16346300	16348300	He wasn't even hurting me. It's just...
16348300	16350300	It's a huntsman!
16350300	16353300	They don't hurt, but they just, like, look terrifying and stuff.
16353300	16356300	Where on earth am I going?
16356300	16358300	This is under the town.
16359300	16361300	Oh, we're getting red pieces, though.
16361300	16363300	I'm not complaining.
16364300	16365300	And 100 rupees.
16365300	16366300	Hold on a minute.
16366300	16368300	Hold on a minute.
16369300	16371300	Oh, something's happening.
16371300	16374300	I don't know what the heck all this is, but I'll take it.
16375300	16377300	Looks like it's a team effort.
16377300	16380300	The library quests, by flying to the lake,
16380300	16382300	you can't reach the Minish house otherwise.
16383300	16385300	Let's fly to the lake.
16389300	16391300	Ah, that's really good.
16391300	16393300	This is a lot of digging.
16394300	16397300	I am a dwarf and I'm digging a wood.
16397300	16398300	Diggy, diggy, wood.
16398300	16400300	Diggy, diggy, diggy, diggy.
16402300	16403300	There's a chest.
16404300	16405300	Wow, three red pieces.
16405300	16407300	Don't mind if I do, honestly.
16411300	16413300	Under construction.
16413300	16414300	Yes, that's fine.
16414300	16417300	Oh, we can go into the back of the bakery if we get small.
16418300	16419300	Can I go in here yet?
16422300	16426300	But I can't access the thing.
16434300	16435300	I've already forgotten what I'm supposed to do.
16435300	16436300	I'm to fly.
16438300	16439300	I'm to fly.
16440300	16441300	I'm to fly.
16446300	16448300	Ah, I am.
16448300	16449300	What the heck?
16456300	16457300	Hello.
16457300	16458300	Oh hi, a visitor.
16458300	16459300	How are you?
16459300	16460300	But you have phoned me.
16460300	16462300	The wisest of the wisest of whys.
16463300	16464300	You...
16464300	16465300	What?
16465300	16467300	You want to enter the temple you can see in the lake.
16467300	16469300	They call that place the temple of droplets.
16469300	16473300	I've heard rumors that one Minish actually did find a way long ago.
16473300	16476300	That Minish is Elder Libri Rari.
16476300	16480300	And he is in semi-retirement in Towns Library.
16480300	16481300	Yes!
16481300	16482300	Okay, thank you.
16482300	16484300	Towns Library.
16484300	16485300	There we go.
16485300	16490300	Luckily we just picked up that piece because we can actually use it.
16490300	16492300	What does it do?
16492300	16495300	That is at the swamp.
16497300	16499300	We should go grab it.
16499300	16501300	Yes, we will go grab it.
16501300	16503300	Hey, they fit perfectly.
16503300	16504300	Yes they do.
16504300	16505300	What are the odds?
16505300	16506300	Can I trade you again?
16506300	16507300	No.
16507300	16509300	He lives in the Towns Library.
16509300	16511300	Towns Library.
16511300	16512300	Library.
16512300	16513300	Library.
16513300	16514300	Let's go.
16520300	16522300	I still have the best feet for me.
16522300	16523300	Oh, sorry.
16523300	16524300	I accidentally backed out.
16524300	16526300	I picked that up though.
16528300	16529300	Stop.
16533300	16536300	Travel to the library.
16536300	16538300	Absolutely.
16538300	16540300	Let's see what we're working with.
16540300	16541300	Yes!
16543300	16545300	We can get in.
16545300	16546300	It took us long enough.
16546300	16547300	Hello.
16547300	16551300	Who is blocking that entire town?
16551300	16552300	Oh look!
16552300	16555300	Oh look at all the wee baby footprints from the minnish.
16560300	16564300	Sometimes these books move on their own, I've seen it with my own two eyes
16564300	16567300	and don't tell me I'm crazy, I ain't crazy.
16568300	16570300	Oh he makes quite a unique noise.
16570300	16571300	Right.
16571300	16573300	Let us begin.
16578300	16581300	He was raging at them books honestly.
16581300	16582300	It was down here.

16811580	16814860	well cuz he needs to come back so the cat will swipe at you so if you get a bit
16814860	16821660	too close why dodged it correct what that really startled me everything's

16829860	16834060	around the cat look at it shaking his little butt they actually put so much
16834060	16838380	detail into this game they could have just done like swipe motion on cat but
16838380	16844940	no they like actually did the they did the nature of the cat correctly okay we
16844940	16849820	have obtained the first book you got a library book called the hurry on me

16868180	16877340	the cat under the book cats are really they're such a silly animal I don't
16877340	16881780	sense weird to say but they hate their pain and stuff so if there's something

19441520	19446360	shocking behavior and but like I just enjoy like playing a wee story and like
19446360	19450400	going through it I'll say that as if I didn't really enjoy Elden Ring with you
19450400	19456800	guys though and so but I only enjoyed Elden Ring because you guys can hold my
19456800	19462520	hand through it but like I enjoy like a kind of calm like fun experience it's
19462520	19466520	just casual and like you gotta be story and it's like so cute and you can admire
19466520	19473280	the the visuals you can admire the sound design the music all of that I just
19473280	19478120	think it's rather lovely you know I didn't want to be sitting you know
19478120	19484320	playing dark souls replaying I say that I'm kind of saying dark souls but I
19484320	19487560	just play Elden Ring and get carried through it so I can't really check anything

19597440	19603640	and oh I did manage to watch some more about true gameplay I think we can do a
19603680	19611040	about true gameplay so a full house is when you have three of any card and two
19611040	19618320	of any card and oh I'm gonna get hurt here my apologies oh I didn't need the
19618320	19628440	house okay stop geez and straight is when you have a missing one from a flush
19629040	19635000	no a flush is when you have a missing one but a straight flush is when you have
19635000	19642280	five that are correct in the sequence and then you can do like two doubles or
19642280	19649400	you can play quads and so I think I think we can successfully do a
19649480	19662200	about true stream without perishing too much what's this what's a royal flush when
19662200	19672520	the flush has King Queen and Jack in it I'm gonna get turds dropped on my head I
19672520	19679040	think I don't know I'm not sure but I have enough knowledge to try and win at
19679040	19683480	the game a ball true is one of those games where if you lose you lose but
19683480	19702360	it's fine I'm gonna slide in any I'm gonna sneeze sorry sorry and down Ray
19702360	19716560	south west go down Ray and then south and then west and then off okay flush is
19716560	19724200	seems to straight is in any sequence royal flushes a oops okay I got close
19724200	19733920	close to the answer was a perfect place to see what a wonderful scene yes also
19733920	19745600	I'm such a kawaii name game whichever huh I'm so kawaii name no short to scare
19745600	19748640	yes you're more than welcome you're more than welcome I'll sneeze in your open

19830400	19839640	bit of exploring after this because now once we are not whoa okay we're we're

19846720	19850840	after this one to get like fill hearts and all the items and stuff because I
19850840	19856760	think we're supposed to have more health by now and like do like more of the

19860720	19871480	so much more access to stuff unless we go get the last item of course sunlight
19871480	19876600	once we get some sunlight or melt the ice the element is as good as ours okay

20974920	20988360	is the second one. Okay, I can handle that. We already got them. Oh, things are falling
20988360	21009520	on my head. I don't like it. Easy. Take it easy, buddy. Oh, is he just spamming it? I'll
21009520	21020480	take it. If you're just spamming it, I'll take it. Is it a dry bite? Wow, we did it. We
21020480	21032600	have 10 minutes to spare for Shabby. Let's go. We get the element. What is it? The water?
21032600	21046080	It must be water. Ice element doesn't make sense. You got the water element. Water quenches
21046080	21051640	thirst, ends droughts and nourishes life. The water element is the embodiment of that power.
21051640	21060040	I love and a heart. Oh, we can go to that man. That will teach us properly. One, two, three, four.
21060040	21071600	Yeah. Yeah. Let's get the heck out of here. I won't be here anymore. Here we go. Shabby's live
21071600	21087240	right now. Wait, I thought it was a 10. Oh, it is 10 already. Oh, young one. Child who
21087240	21096880	seeks to aid the princess of Hyrule. My name is Gustaf. I was king of Hyrule countless ages ago.
21096880	21109000	Stand before me. Only then will the path be open to you. Huh, was that just a dream? He said he
21109000	21115400	was the king of Hyrule. Wait, look at your map, Link. There's something marked on it. Huh, I guess
21115400	21120760	that means it wasn't a dream? We should head there once we've infused your sword with that element.
21121200	21126640	To the elemental sanctuary at once. Okay, then it's graveyard, then it's
21126640	21137440	airtop, and then we're done. Yeah, we made some fast progress. Holy moly. I definitely think we
21137440	21152560	should be exploring now. Because we're definitely getting close to end game content. What time is
21152560	21161880	that? Okay, I am going to end there. And then for members, I am going to do a membership stream.
21162800	21169920	In like 10 minutes, I will put it up. You cannot see the stream right now because I've not put it up.
21169920	21178160	But don't worry, I will put it up. If you give me 10 minutes after I end the stream for any members
21178160	21186840	of the channel, we are going to be doing the forbidden, the forbidden tier list. I'm not sure
21186840	21201400	how long that's gonna take. We'll see, we'll see. As for any, any what? Any notes? I'm going to try
21201400	21213920	and upload my special 2000 thank you. Today, I'm also going to try and see if I tomorrow I can
21213920	21218120	upload the first collab with Mimosa. She has been waiting so patiently. I mean, Denpah's been
21218120	21224480	waiting patiently. And so is this third person that I haven't told yous who I'm collabing with. I
21224480	21233400	don't think. Your hint is like wolf. Right, customization, redirect, and to none other than
21233400	21240360	Shibi Quarrenboom. Oh, Shibi is doing smash her pass with Toma Keys. I actually don't know much
21240360	21247880	about Toma Keys, but if Shibi knows her, then we are in good company. Shibi has fantastic friends.
21247880	21253880	Right, in 10 minutes without strany. Yes, give me 10 minutes. I'm going to see if I can drop
21253880	21258240	a loaf of bread. I'm going to make a cup of tea and all of that. But give me a few minutes and then
21258240	21263200	the stream will pop up. Don't worry. For those of you who are unable to member, please don't worry.
21263200	21268400	I always have free content daily and not only are you getting the stream, you're also getting a
21268440	21274640	video today as well. That will come up on YouTube soon to you. Thank you so so much for hanging
21274640	21283640	and we will finish this fantastic childhood game tomorrow. Nothing, nothing but fantastic nostalgia
21283640	21292720	this stream has been. And I will see you, if I don't see you in 10 minutes, I will see you tomorrow
