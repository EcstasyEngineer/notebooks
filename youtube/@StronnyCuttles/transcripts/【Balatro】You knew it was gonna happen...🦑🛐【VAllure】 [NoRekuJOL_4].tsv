412960	417280	reeflings does person like you're my reefling like literally you're on my chest right now being
417280	426960	jelly i was for content for me i think i'm about to upload a ASMR early access and
429680	436480	that's it for today i don't have a collab coming out but i can't record anything oh my god your
436480	442160	profile picture is that the pregnant you is that you and my tummy with that profile picture don't lie
442240	451920	that reefling is literally being okay reeflings strung together it's the prego yes unfortunately
451920	459840	i can't record any new ASMR because of my dad but he's come down with a cold um he cannot
460400	466320	his scottish genes cannot handle the ozzy cold we went i think because we went out to the cafe
466880	471920	and he's picked up a cold so i don't know how he's doing um he's like all sniffily he had to
471920	476640	get medicine to go to sleep because he was so jet lagged and all that so i'm a bit worried about him
477760	484160	um but next week is like two hour streams and no more like it cut off two hour streams and
484160	489600	especially if my dad's not feeling well so yes we are gonna get stuck into it we have a hex
489600	495360	add a polychrome to a random joker and destroys all other jokers so we are gonna make sure we
495360	505440	remember we have this um um gain 25 bucks is a lot what's this one next is a joker and free
507920	516320	i'm all in i'm all in on the the rewards discard two random hearts pair cards pair hand okay so
516320	522000	it's been a hot second now we can do it by suit we could get a suit in theory but if it's gonna
522000	527120	discard what we play i don't know get rid of the
530480	535600	well i don't like this maybe go for a heart no of course because that would be too easy
535600	538400	what we got jack 10 98 7
539120	552080	I don't know what to go for a flush maybe we need a seven and we could get a flush going here
554000	557760	we've only got two more discards left so i really shouldn't be doing this but
557920	566720	oh dear oh dear oh dear i think i've absolutely twatted myself on this run
567920	570880	a one pair is all i can get away with right now
574720	579040	well we can't do a flush so just go for high cards
581520	586640	absolute pitch we can do a pair that's the best we can do we have no more discards i'm sorry
586640	590560	i got cocky okay oh wow i've thrown so hard
594640	600400	i'll do another pair shout out to all my pairs yeah i've thrown wow
602720	605600	oh that was such a good start as well with the offers
606320	616240	yeah drat i've absolutely abysmal this i can only play a high card here one pair
617360	618560	and what i'll get rid of these
621520	625200	one pair and play i'm so sorry curses upon the
626160	631840	aw throwing yeah full house i don't know if we're gonna make it though
632160	639360	drat just shy that honestly just shy let's try that again that was such good
639360	645360	planes though right we've got the polychrome doubles your money well we can't even do that
645360	650000	because we ain't got no money hi glad to see you playing the card game the gamble oh hold on sorry
650000	654560	my tracking my iphone is right in the way so i can't actually see what i'm doing hold on i need
655040	656080	need a recalibrate
660160	666000	okay recalibrate warm-up game it's real okay the house strong it's gone no we already lost the
666000	672640	house right i don't see a flush i see a triple though oh baby a triple okay we've got full house
672640	679680	already off the bat very happy with that and this is again just a shorter stream so please do not
680240	688080	uh don't get too comfy we can't go that way i really need that skip card again i love that
688080	694640	skip card for suits the high table wins again i can't believe it did you guys like that stream
694640	700080	where we were reviewing the other uh folks uh designs i thought it was so cute oh we do have a
700080	707120	suit sorry i saw a flush sorry a flush but it's all the same color there's no way i can't get
707120	715600	comfy here with you he loved it i thought it was a fun idea right add a polychrome joker it destroys
715600	722720	them the first hand of the round only has one card add a permanent copy of it could i just go out on
722720	734400	aces uh playing cards can be purchased from the shop what one dna is good super early dna right let's
734400	740720	go for it and then we're gonna use him right now okay then what we got a dollar so we can't do nothing
740720	747280	with that okay but we've got a multiplier we're gonna go next base edition joker is free and
747280	752560	becomes a foil but it's only 50 chips which i'm not that interested in is there an ace
755120	760480	well they're just upgrade suits after we've gone through five thousand nine and two just one more
760480	765600	round never seen any of the other videos to check them out they're pretty i know it was fun to see
765600	772080	other do i hope you get inspired for gentle i do you right i'm gonna sip my tea ah it's already
772080	779280	look warm well i do a king well i just do suit cards do king or should i save it for aces only i feel
779280	784000	like it was a waste if i don't play it though if i first hand around only has one card add a permanent
784000	791200	version of it let's just a kit let's do that here we go okay so king king king uh
793840	799440	i can get rid of these please the natural girl dog and the paw patrol we're pretty cute
799440	804000	and she's called the say so please which is so adorable absolutely adored it
804000	807760	my god duble v here and we'll just play that don't mind us
808480	819680	okay okay it feels good feels good feels good feels good right gains for consecutive hand
819680	823840	played without a face so we absolutely do not want that we're going out on faces
825200	832240	not interested and we have nothing that's really shaping our deck so i'm gonna hold on for economy
832240	842800	playing cards now where you all space cards are debuff that's fine okay i'm gonna oh am i gonna
842800	854640	regret this am i gonna regret doing this i'll duplicate it and save bucket okay we've got a pack
854640	860640	i've got a twin and we'll play that because it's debuffed we're going out on high cards we're going
860640	867200	all out what we've got queens and aces this is terrible hand let's get rid of all this nonsense
871600	880080	we do have a double here and then get rid of the low it's pretty debuffed though oh dear well i've
880080	886560	just absolutely ruined that run as well i'm really good at doing that like i'm really really good at
886560	895440	ruining runs what am i looking at double what do i need a full house maybe
899840	902080	ace king queen jack ten
905680	907920	yeah that looks right
908320	919600	oh we just made it we just made it we saved it we just made it okay we've got a stick
919600	922640	a straight random multiplier
927840	935040	do we hold on to economy or do we do misprint the chance of adding a 21 multi can come through though
937920	943120	her hat was great detail honestly i love seeing other vtuber designs see what they come up with
943120	948640	because obviously agency vtubers are signed whereas indie vtubers came up with a concept
948640	955920	theirself which makes such a difference um definitely like right next round we'll we'll stick
955920	962640	to economy we'll stick to economy gives five bucks per skipped blind gives five bucks no what are you
963360	970240	initial cards and booster packs are sorry who goes there um identify yourself right king we're
970240	977200	gonna activate playhand we're gonna double vr king so we've got more king we've got a full house
977200	982880	lovely lovely it was not a very good burp oh my god she be rated my burp so if you didn't know a
982880	990160	little behind the scenes for you um when you do a collab you all get in voice chat together one
990160	994480	hour before the collab and like i was drinking my team we were just talking away and all that
994480	1000080	and i burped and she be rated it and i was like oh god i feel so embarrassed of the girls but
1000080	1007840	she burps as well so it's oh no we've only got one hand to play oh i really don't want to end
1007840	1015040	this run already it's such a good one let's see if we can spawn in an ace
1019040	1027520	a full house 40 times four is like what and then plus the tens that's gonna that'll do it that'll
1027520	1034400	do it sorry this is it this is it there we go easy peasy and it's a 1.5 multi i need to remember that
1034400	1041600	so the the math is math and okay one six it's funny that you rate each other burps too honestly
1041600	1047360	sorry i'm like no don't worry this isn't my usual start start time please don't worry if you for any
1047360	1053920	vod watchers as well if you weren't here i purposely did not say that i was streaming after the
1053920	1061520	collab so more people would be going to azura's way um but yes um i realized like oh i need to
1061520	1069280	stream because uh if i don't i'm gonna break my little streaming streak 10 4 and a dna run
1070960	1080400	each played 10 or 4 gives chips and plus 4 when scored oh that's so unique it's not times 4 it's
1080400	1084160	plus 4 are we going pears
1087840	1089840	are we shaping it into a pear run
1093680	1101120	we might we might shape it into a pear run not economy i mean you can sell jolly whenever
1101200	1110480	it doesn't work on me i check your channel daily ah always do the two pear run we need jolly for
1110480	1121200	this next round though we need jolly who's jolly jolly joker uh these rounds have been

1139440	1146800	we're doing we're shaping the run for pears uh initial cards and booster packs are free
1147360	1151360	we have such low economy that might be good
1153520	1160080	because we have low economy it's plus not times i know but if we start shaping it for pears
1160640	1164880	don't worry about it i merely cried for one and a half hours because of serious straw name

1796560	1809200	yeah i do but do you do as well no that's not how it works for women
1812000	1819200	chalkboard is so good three times multiplier if all cards held in hand are space and clubs
1819200	1825520	the odds of me getting that is rubbish though that's awful that's like so hard to set up

1937360	1945200	and so doesn't mean gosh it is right go oh my god when i was at the cafe the guy behind the till
1945200	1950960	couldn't understand me i was like can i just get a regular cola please and apparently they say coke

1966720	1972720	i guess they call it coke in australia sorry sorry like oh gosh if i got a king i could have
1972720	1980480	actually done a sweep there you know that can i get a king please not really can i get a king
1981040	1988640	king that's a jack well whatever off you go no that i extend it i honestly don't
1988640	1993600	think my accent's that strong at all but apparently is right we got three bucks ooh
1993600	2006320	we're in the money i can't buy it i'm too poor are you serious
2007040	2015120	i'm too poor to set up the best run are you serious
2018960	2021840	right we're gonna take this 10 plus holographic
2023360	2030160	and hopefully win this one we need jokers like off the dang bat but we're not getting them
2030160	2041120	oh wait no that's not pair i've just wasted that so much are you serious i thought that was a pair
2045040	2050000	why am i so blank i've literally thrown this one i've thrown so hard bra
2050000	2060160	ah why do i suck so much today i'm so sorry all we're getting is red screen right stop
2060160	2064000	i didn't lose it there's just a new game i don't know my game glitched out i don't know why it was
2064000	2071520	happening something weird's going on with my screen i don't know what's happening
2072480	2079520	i'm like i don't know okay i don't know there a straight go for it
2082800	2085360	well i mean i've reached i only need 150 now
2087760	2092000	give me something a bit better than that though right sure give me that
2093040	2096560	shimmy oh wait no i should roll for a full house
2097440	2110160	i absolutely despise when the game i absolutely get i get triggered when the
2110160	2114240	game does that to me honestly right give me this free joker and it better be good
2115440	2118800	each king held gives a multiplier oh that's actually really good
2120880	2124880	adds the sale value of all other jokers owned to a multiplier
2127120	2133920	i mean i guess i kind of need to go all out on jokers like right at the start or else we're
2133920	2142000	not getting anywhere because we only have three hands right think about it logically
2143440	2150240	what should i do if a king is held in the hand i get 1.5
2151200	2153920	so
2158480	2167440	the scar each king so i want more kings in my hand club flush is available
2171200	2175520	fish for kings but don't play them keep clubs and king fish for a flush
2175600	2179200	get rid of them then
2185520	2188320	i hope that's what you're asking me to do refling
2191120	2195200	okay so we have a flush and we're gonna keep that king in the hand
2195600	2208000	oh okay okay oh yeah okay okay no let me get up gain three value at the end of a round
2208000	2217040	oh is that like a stock market egg that's all he wrote um right we're gonna keep should we buy
2217040	2224160	that and then just sell it spectral you want the spectral egg is pretty peak okay well we're
2224160	2230480	going to do it invest in our future by buying the stock market egg and then we'll get the spectral
2230480	2236880	pack to see what's inside why not add a blue seal destroy one random card in your hand
2237840	2242960	um add a purple seal to the selected card you creates a turret when discarded
2243680	2250080	create destroy one random right when discarded so put it on a low put medium on a low
2250960	2262000	because it says discarded so surely i discard the lower cards yes is that how it works yes okay
2262000	2267200	thank god i'm really out of it literally you don't you don't play a game for a little bit
2267200	2277440	ooh free joker free joker all diamond cards are debuffed but free joker though
2278400	2285520	yeah the more joker value also that goes up 25 bucks should i do should i do them both
2286960	2296160	no no give me the free joker okay now we'll have a suit unfortunately a king would get consumed in
2296160	2300400	that i'm not sure i want that
2303920	2309600	because that would give times three keep the kings could discard the ace in the three
2310800	2313520	and try and fish for another part
2317200	2324160	when discarded fuck you beach increase the rank of two selected cards
2326160	2331840	can i do what i think i can do and then wait level up the queen
2334480	2339760	strength the queen now that's a blush should i level up the queen in the jack
2341520	2346160	queen and jack increases the rank of up to two selected cards by one
2347280	2355040	yeah okay yeah all right i'm doing it really see what it comes out to if i do this
2355680	2358240	we've got 1.5 for every king held
2362640	2366560	oh we did it we did it we did it and our little egg went up in value
2367840	2374160	okay not bad what are you the first hand of round is a single is a single six destroy it and
2374160	2386480	create a spectrum oh curious curious curious it to double dip it's a multi put it after the pirate
2386480	2395440	yard okay we'll hold on to our economy again unfortunately we don't really have anything
2395440	2401280	that's actually shaping other than the kings might want to move your first joker to the end
2402240	2408080	to apply all the multis that come in my little egg is now worth five dollar e-dos
2409200	2411680	can use six cents to thin the deck out of that
2413440	2416880	well and get rid of the the weird ones and
2423440	2430400	destroy it and create a spectrum okay we're gonna hold on to our economy king maxing for real
2430800	2436160	yes now baron multiplies the thing yeah right we're king maxing let's see what we've got nope
2436160	2444400	don't do that right we've got two kings off the bat and let's see what we've got we've got a double
2445840	2452960	eight it's not the best if first hand of is a six well we don't actually have one could fish for a
2452960	2463520	six all right let's do that let's do that guess i'll go if myself right throw away these
2466240	2474240	uh and we'll get a turret creates a random joker a card must have room sure two chips for each
2474240	2482880	remaining card in the deck sure why not and knock yourself out right i think we're in trouble
2483520	2492000	we have one discard left six gaming wait can i keep doing it if first hand of round is a six no
2492560	2497040	just one six it only works on one six cents oh i just realized the card's called six cents
2498560	2501840	play the six alone wait have i played a hand yet no
2502960	2504560	uh play this one because it's useless
2505280	2516240	wow add a red seal re-trigger this card one time wait if i add a seal to a king is it gonna trigger
2517040	2518960	baron twice
2519440	2534560	oh my gosh oh my gosh now i am struggling to get anything to play
2539600	2544160	now we just need a copier card this is gonna be crazy it'll be what's left in the deck
2544640	2551360	hmm we're kind of looking at getting tens or aces to come in
2554160	2561600	spades flush could be an option and kids we only have one more discard left though
2564240	2571040	on average we wouldn't draw it though i'd be forced to play like an ace or a king or something
2572000	2580880	um diamond is the most likely suit you're right but diamonds are debuffed completely
2582720	2587200	through the joker as well i'm not doing anything
2590000	2596560	two plus chips and then egg or beloved egg i will sell egg soon oh he's four he's plus 14
2596560	2603040	the sell value i guess he swashbuckler and egg actually kiss each other very nicely i say we
2603040	2611280	look for tens and nine fuck it fuck it i've got a double here a double there and get rid of the two
2612160	2615680	i know these are debuffed i'm aware but i think we're okay
2616960	2623840	but the kings that are okay yeah we're fine the kings are having fun the kings are having fun don't
2623840	2626560	worry right whoo what's this
2628240	2636400	hmm that's big one times multiplier for each empty joker hmm we have no for me
2638640	2644160	the double kings are popping off choose one of three playing cards i mean loyalty cards
2645040	2649600	we can always sell something later like as i said the egg maybe we can sell later he's worth eight
2649600	2662640	bucks at the moment um king is carrying oh right hard hard hard okay choose two up to two
2662640	2669360	four spectral cards we use immediately right i'll do a loyalty card we can always sell it if we're
2669360	2677840	not feeling it you know it's not a big deal um let's see what we're up against though oh no
2678800	2685520	we're gonna have to get rid of something oh but we can't double skip the shop or else it's not
2685520	2691600	gonna play next based edition shop joker is free and polychrome it's a times 1.5
2697840	2703920	should i do it i feel like once we sell the egg it's fine to have low economy because the egg is
2703920	2708560	currently eight we might sell them next round you might want to look at the hands we can play
2713120	2720240	well i do spectrum the egg is buffing the pirate it is you're right
2725680	2729200	ideally we want a few kings our deck is five and we want to get more
2729920	2734960	hmm i don't know if the standard pack's gonna give me what i want no what's the spectral card do
2734960	2740400	you want spectral yeah sell the egg next round okay i'm gonna do the spectral in exchange of the egg
2740400	2747520	what are these destroy one random but give two enhanced aces i want king add a gold seal three
2747520	2754320	bucks earned when this card is played convert all cards into a single random rank one heart
2754400	2765440	upgrade every poker by one i mean it wouldn't take away or remove a king it would just have an
2765440	2771360	extra ace all levels is free black hole is always good all right let's pop black hole
2773520	2779760	what did that do oh we can have a second chance okay well we just do gold seal destroy a random
2779760	2784640	card in your hand but it gives you two enhanced aces i mean i feel like it's probably gonna attack
2784640	2788160	something we don't want right if a card is played so we'll shove it on a queen
2790000	2794880	if we make all cards the same rank we could get something nice though but it puts my hand size down
2794880	2805360	by one which scares me it scares me i'm scared i'll do the gold if i if i lose i right we're
2805360	2811440	gonna skip to get our times i assume if i skip again it's not gonna show them up is it
2813200	2817760	because i'm sure i played a game where i skipped and i only got offered one joker card
2823040	2830640	bad bad bad belt troll player honestly can anyone you'd get both for free i have to like oh i do
2830720	2837440	right okay fuck it fuck it we're going all out right we've got a king and he re-triggers
2837440	2842560	but he's debuffed so he's even gonna properly re-trigger all right let's see what we're looking at
2843920	2849360	let's see what we're looking at we've got a tarot card if we discard what we're looking at suitwise
2850160	2857200	we actually have a suit unbelievable king of clubs won't proc because he's debuffed unbelievable
2857200	2861040	i could have put it on any other king and i picked that one right we're gonna throw away
2861040	2866080	because we can get a tarot if we do this so well we just do a classic discard
2868320	2875680	and see what we can fish for i think if we fish for more are you ah i was debuffed
2878880	2883200	oh we're about to get a diamond flush i think we're gonna go for diamond flush

3835120	3839440	draft destroy two selected cards what like right now
3842240	3843120	i mean i guess
3846080	3850080	we can thin the deck out a bit okay i'll what destroy a two and an eight
3851040	3856640	could make a space flush right now artificially yes i can
3858080	3871120	so one two and three no three then make them speed prank them john and then one two three four five
3871360	3878480	sure yeah sure that'll work right
3881200	3886560	hey we did it we did it we did it do the card thing now no if i destroyed it i wouldn't have
3886560	3895200	been able to do the flush played cards with speeds wait whoa what's going on with the 1.5
3895280	3902400	oh wait wait wait re-triggers all played face cut oh no played not sitting in my hand
3903600	3907440	1.5 who would we give up the stone

3914880	3922080	okay yes we're in agreement okay i am so smart uh i'm gonna buy the blank because i i've still

3926640	3932400	it one playing card three i mean i'm like did we just spend our economy at this point
3934000	3936240	i must i must be patient i must behave
3939120	3943920	but i could add more kings to the deck though did you think about that
3944080	3953200	hmm take a standard and see i would spend to get the hologram off what hologram steel joker
3954160	3959680	we want space speed card will she be tempted by greed greed run
3962400	3968080	we have enough kings okay okay okay okay i will hold on to economy because we're gonna need to start
3968080	3975120	pumping up them numbers those are ricky numbers okay must play five cards in each hand that is fine
3975120	3981520	by me we can spade kings or steel we want to have three kings in hand and then play a spade flush
3983040	3985840	i'm not sure how good i can optimize the run like that
3987760	3995840	uh it might be worth grabbing this one to make sure we're fine in the psychic
3995840	4003040	bains the psychic of isaac whoa okay what room three bucks have played retrigger
4005040	4015760	um okay we have enough we have a double let's see how much we get and if i get a lower card

4187120	4191520	um choose one of five playing cards if we can get a steal
4194480	4194960	draft
4198080	4198560	draft
4202800	4209760	right okay queen is that was a bit of a waste of money i shouldn't have done that i failed for it
4210320	4217600	i fell for it right now this one four of spades is too good oh did i pick wrong
4220240	4228560	oopsies i picked wrong i'm sorry i forgot uh i think we should skip it says must play five
4228560	4235280	cards if we can roll the kings into our hand like instantly i think i think we're winning because
4235280	4242800	22k is a tall order are you guys okay if we skip who goes there i would skip too yeah we have
4242800	4252640	wrathful joker i'm very small brained i'm sorry oh whoa this is exactly what we were looking for
4252640	4260880	right hold on let's analyze the situation analyzing me analyzing what we got have we got a suit oh we
4260880	4264800	do we could do the suit
4268640	4275840	a spade flush should i play the queen right now for the extra three bucks just in case
4277840	4283520	a but high card and queen first right okay well so queen and then just take away all of this rubbish
4283520	4288960	as well so we can get our three bucks and then i'll do the flush deal deal okay we'll do that don't
4288960	4295840	worry oh no he's twitching oh no it's fine oh thank goodness okay it's okay you're allowed to twitch
4295840	4302480	it's fine it's fine you're allowed to twitch okay you did the king oh wait did i just throw away a king
4305520	4313360	oops you don't like it when it twitches oh sorry i don't know what's happened all of a
4313360	4316800	sudden i don't know how to play battle throw and it's only been like what how much
4319200	4321600	a loyalty card yeah no
4323520	4326880	a loyalty card came through earned money at the end of a round
4328480	4332720	do we want that i mean loyalty card would have to give it up
4335680	4341360	i'm gonna say something controversial i think get rid of loyalty card and then raise our economy
4341360	4348480	artificially so we can start really going and hammering into packs because we're needing help
4348480	4354640	let me just throw in for more content yes lose loyalty yeah i think loyalty is just it's only
4354640	4364080	coming in so i'm gonna go max out on economy one of four uh one consumable slot one of these up
4364080	4370080	here i don't really need that it only works one six at a time yeah it's not really coming through
4370080	4376480	okay destroy a random card creates a random rare joker but it sets your money to zero
4378560	4386400	i don't even have space for um i wish that was a negative joker but it's not destroy five but gain
4386400	4397280	money um add a gold seal i think add a gold seal add a gold seal yeah nice and nice and safe gold
4397280	4403040	seal a bit boring but we're going to try and artificially inflate our economy right we've
4403040	4410720	got destroy one random card in the hand but add four enchanted just converts all cards in hand
4410720	4421600	to a single random suit now if that paid off it would be 50 50 if we got clubber speed that is
4422240	4430640	one to consider destroy one random card no and creates a joker i think we're gonna risk it for
4430640	4441120	sigil i think we'll risk it for sigil yeah okay 50 50 we want club or spade
4443600	4450640	okay okay it's not the end of the world it's not the end of the world it's okay it's okay
4450640	4458240	it is a 50 50 if we got something it's not the end of the world okay it's fine it's fine
4459600	4464320	all right we're gonna hold on to the the money since we can't really spend anything else
4465680	4470400	upgrade four of a kind by three levels that's like such a good artificial inflation though
4471200	4481280	um initial cards are free next shop no i'm gonna try and play i've never we never played
4481280	4490240	four of a kind you're absolutely right we oh okay okay okay okay let him get up uh
4490640	4502400	um okay okay okay i definitely want to throw these out oh it has to score it has to score do
4502400	4511680	not be fooled play the queen of clubs and nothing else just her on her own right so that's an economy
4511680	4522240	shot and then we'll go for a spade flush okay happy with that and then we'll go for a spade
4524560	4532320	and then we'll go for a spade thank you we'll definitely play you do and then all of you
4532320	4537840	together and we get an extra three bucks on top go show me what i want to see
4540000	4548000	oh baby that's exactly what we wanted to see and we got an extra money so we made 10 bucks
4548000	4558160	that round well we made a bit more than 10 if we full house we won so easy great one all good
4558800	4563520	leave it to me uh right we never economies jumped up
4565040	4572880	money uh we don't need a consumable slot a tarot if we could transfer something into speeds
4577440	4580000	select two cards and convert the left into the right
4580800	4581600	uh
4584400	4587680	hmm we could maybe get another spade on our side
4590080	4592400	our emperor just go emperor
4595040	4603920	fuck it okay doubles money right i'll take it enhances one card into a glass
4603920	4614640	turn stone into a queen uh probably should all right we're gonna get money will we use a glass
4617200	4622080	it has a chance to absolutely destroy it though which is pretty high right we'll see if we've got
4623040	4624080	hmm
4631920	4640960	last space yeah i'm i'm clean too always do yeah yeah why did you go up this joker gains uh every
4640960	4648480	time a playing card is added to the deck i am a dumbass i understand okay we don't want these
4649120	4654560	these aren't good enough these are all given like 1.5s and stuff let's let's stick to the
4654560	4661600	1.5s hologram we will try and level up hologram now we can't get rid of the golden joker possibly
4665360	4669120	hmm uh yeah i'm kind of like golden joker
4669520	4678160	understand's brain has so many wrinkles put the joker on the right to the left
4679600	4684720	yes no don't get rid of them just yet okay well wait until something better comes up than
4684720	4693600	abstract joker it's not bad but it's not exactly mind boggling okay we never play four of a kind
4693600	4700160	so nice try game but we will not be tempted by your demon abilities right what we looking at
4701920	4707760	we could try and roll for a club's flush and play the queen
4710320	4714640	we could go for a club's flush what you feeling are you want to queen into inside
4716160	4720480	i can't even pretend to understand the game honestly i didn't understand it when i first
4720480	4727840	played but it's just like a chill little thing queen queen five five queen queen five five and then
4727840	4739200	get rid of the nine and now get rid of the six no get rid of the nine queen queen five five nine
4740640	4748560	i'm i don't know if i messed up i tried oh i got 10k for that hand okay i i would really love
4748560	4751280	if we could get the thing that gives us another hand because
4753600	4757600	it's getting a bit i'm getting shaky okay i'm getting a bit nervous um
4763120	4766720	now we can do a double get rid of the five
4767360	4779040	i'd fish for more kings double pair again i mean it has to make
4782320	4788320	i could just discard these two and see if we can get king from it well close enough
4790080	4793600	full house right i'll take a full house and we should get a king after this
4794000	4802720	we should get a few hits as well okay yeah we're fine we're fine smooth sailing smooth sailing
4802720	4809200	don't worry don't worry don't panic don't panic you're fine we have three more discards but we
4809200	4816160	need a hand we're not really there's two more jacks in an ace so yeah even if we play like a singular
4816160	4825840	here discard for more spades really that's enough space oh no we are the likelihood of
4825840	4837600	rolling a speed is very high okay we would have to get those are you fucking serious
4837600	4842000	speed
4845200	4849920	okay that's exactly yeah yeah okay one two three four five nice nice nice nice okay we're done

4876800	4880480	which i don't like gold seal enhances that bonus clubs
4881440	4888800	clubs and spades i think we're gonna have to change some things into clubs yo the flush joker
4890240	4895200	your record is still 2.5 million moon or yeah i'm thinking moon honestly
4899360	4901440	i think it's better to convert
4902400	4911600	make our spades into bonus i feel like it's because we have an artificial amount of diamonds
4911600	4921280	at the moment i want to even up the playing field and try and get more spades oh that would give us
4921280	4929280	clubs moon the hearts four
4932880	4936480	to get rid of even less chance of a heart yeah
4939040	4944400	we have more diamond than clubs we're better off just dusting off the clubs not going for balance
4944560	4945200	um
4948080	4954960	so then more multi-card select two into a multi-card right we'll do it into clubs

6832960	6839280	money we got money money we got 300 for that that's 100 tips plus 20 from the queens and the nine
6839600	6847280	there's no way you can do maths that good to know that's insane
6853040	6859600	quick king king 10 10 3 is this enough there's no way you can do the math that quickly that's
6859600	6865520	insane do you have autism how can you do the math that quick
6867920	6875280	all cards and packs in the shop are cheaper 100 chips this joker gains for each thingy
6879520	6885040	yes i have no diagnosis but i just like math and poker maybe it's maybe it's your special interest
6885120	6891040	what a question i just have this stuff i i cannot do the math like that okay i cannot add
6892400	6896480	don't know how you're doing it you underestimate autism all your tisms are belong to us
6897040	6902240	nearly 10k and it's not enough for her nearly 10k tentacles and none of what do the reeflings get
6902240	6908800	if we make you win i already owe you like two audios and then i owe even more audios on top
6909520	6918640	skip not even the clearance sale money for range balotro audio and i bag second in line are you
6918640	6923520	second in line okay thank you reluctantly saying thanks for the tip i'm so sorry if i scared anyone
6923520	6929040	with my rage but oh my god i start throwing things at the wall when i get ready to throw
6929040	6938640	all my cards get the hollow get the hollow clearance is good right wait do i have another round
6939360	6946320	up coming up coming what have i got i can skip for a rare joker for next i don't know if we should
6946320	6958160	do that wait early hologram is great if i buy clearance sale will it be cheap enough to get
6961520	6965360	strongly the rage draws more people in are you people actually enjoy rage streams
6966080	6973760	no it won't multi everything else clearance will be their next shop okay we will get the multi
6975200	6982160	and we have six bucks so we don't we'll just go next i love your range buying clearance would
6982160	6986640	take two dollars off okay we'll buy clearance next time because i think it does help overall with
6986640	6993360	economy that is kind of shy sense of bonus did we skip for the free joker is the question
6993360	6997120	we have six joker slots and we could get something that might shape a deck
6998960	7004080	we'll skip i think skip skip okay let's get our free joker we can maybe sell it for money for
7004080	7012720	really want okay okay let me analyze i'm analyzing i see jack jack three three and throw the two
7014720	7020240	and jack jack three three oh wait ignore that no don't skip if you want to buy clearance
7020240	7029280	okay jack jack three three and two so we have queen jack ten we need two cards for a straight
7029280	7033200	i mean we have the guaranteed two pair right now i don't know how much it's gonna give though
7034640	7043040	how much is the street in terms of a multiplier straight is a hundred times eight double is
7043040	7052480	20 times two i hate to say it we might be better off going for a place oh wait did i look at the
7052480	7055920	wrong one sorry i looked at the wrong one i said i looked at straight flush sorry sorry sorry sorry
7055920	7064240	sorry all right um it's really not straight is four i love when you read just not hot
7065520	7069440	don't aim for the low that's how you lose all the previous runs so looking for a club flush would
7069440	7074320	be the best but right now holographic joker gives you nothing because i've yet to add a card to the
7074320	7080720	dirt but he is lurking look at him lurking in the shadows getting ready flush is honestly the most
7080720	7087920	generally powerful hand in the game unless you get op builds yeah i'm i've won consecutively
7087920	7095680	jude so what throw away these four and throw away a jack and then get a king and a nine in
7095680	7106240	and go for like a king a nine an ace here jack jack three three two should score four hundred
7107200	7113920	it's a bit on the lower side keep the jack and throw away the wee ones
7116240	7122720	one forget backseat streaming you guys are the stream we want a flush look for clubs
7122720	7129920	look for clubs that makes my hand even smaller oh well we actually might get clubs
7132000	7140880	what am i looking at here that's kind of we're one off of a club but we've got such a strong hand
7142080	7148240	or layer for pin pals and harem shebe is live yes don't be afraid we'll probably redirect into
7148240	7154400	sheepsters if she's up you know you know who else is up my penis oh emi's in the stream too oh they
7154400	7160480	didn't impromptu stream together okay i'll redirect into them if we lose her when doesn't matter
7160480	7165600	i'll just put a big warning in the title and be like i failed shebe is collabing with emi oh what
7165600	7172880	are they doing i'm allowed to stalk them hold on i'm just gonna make sure i'm redirecting into them
7172880	7178320	because i don't want to i don't want to waste it okay i don't want to waste it redirect
7180880	7187280	shebe gorilla oh my god something something giggles stick with emi what are they doing are
7187280	7193200	they reading the scripts live i swear if they're reading the scripts live they're playing with
7193200	7200720	their giggles to stop we only have ace ace jack jack six should i do it ace ace jack jack six
7203600	7206400	i think we should i think we need to start getting points down
7208320	7210080	no wait
7212720	7215440	what is in our deck this is in our deck
7218800	7222240	that is exactly what they're doing okay well as long as they're having fun
7223840	7226320	as long as they're having fun that's the main thing
7228000	7232720	you want to aim for high multi you have to choose to either dig or play hands we can't do both
7233280	7239520	well you guys better start using your one brain cell that you share if i discard for non clubs nice
7239520	7247040	dick bro yeah yeah you like that i've got a big dick yeah it's a script that was red is real i'm
7247040	7252240	pretty sure it's the least costly i have no idea if they've gone and edited it to make it a bit more
7254160	7256400	if we go for club suit
7258960	7262480	if we want to win hard we need to get a straight or a flush
7264320	7266480	i would have to get rid of the ten the queen
7269200	7273520	and the jack and the ace and just go all out for a speed but that's terrible
7273600	7282880	a royal flush of clubs so is how you use that big thick what's left in our deck
7284240	7286560	it's not looking good that's all i'm gonna say
7291680	7294960	i would discard just the diamonds and leave these guys in
7303760	7306960	hmm
7317920	7325120	that was not supposed to work out but it did that was not supposed to work out by most certainly good
7325680	7335120	woo right okay unfortunately we've got rid of our tens really um right so if i do a jack is that
7335120	7349520	enough no it's not no no any hand wins that's it i don't think so wait blue joker blue joker
7349920	7358320	it will be with the plus chips take a look i will math i don't know how any of this right
7358320	7361680	i mean we've got another two hands so it's fine all you do win
7363680	7369040	i do okay okay okay right not as a free joker let me see
7370720	7378640	each played card with diamond suit gives 1.5 win scored suit will change at the end of each round
7378640	7382880	sure and you come knock yourself out right
7388240	7394480	do we want to buy i think we want to buy voucher now or we're gonna lose it yeah we're gonna lose
7394480	7401040	voucher now i know i know but everything's a bit cheaper i know our economy's low i know i know i
7401040	7408560	know right base chips and mullies have had we're not winning this bro we are not winning this
7408560	7416480	i'm so tired eight seven six five four which we don't have we have a double we're very close to a
7416480	7424560	suit as well go super hard for diamonds is that what it is it's diamonds right now
7427680	7432320	we have it what's our new joker ancient it wants diamonds
7432720	7442400	uh should i just throw for diamonds yeah diamond what take out the lower cards
7445200	7449200	new fish for diamond mommy about to lose and be really angry and the script master's gonna get
7449200	7450560	triggered and and he's
7455520	7460720	the queen too okay diamonds out all out on diamonds okay okay
7463200	7472080	what i'm worried about is if i don't discard this damn king we're gonna get rolled the king too
7474720	7480240	discard all non diamonds okay ying wait should i just go for i can't go for a flush
7481680	7487520	uh right level one flush surely this is gonna work surely
7488400	7497120	okay okay okay okay so he's now spades
7499200	7503120	okay okay we've got nine bucks do we want to do anything
7506400	7517360	i really think so i'd buy the standard pack since hologram standard pack okay that's two
7517360	7520480	if two of you say the same thing i'm just like yes yes
7521360	7526240	uh we could do money we could do money or we could do 10
7528640	7538000	up to you you want the queen yeah queen money okay darling right so that did upgrade our hologram
7538960	7542640	and then we go next next
7542640	7550000	stones are shite unless you've got a deck around them i think that'd be very specific okay next
7550000	7556800	it is re-rolls the next shop nope ooh we've got a 1.5 joker coming up though
7560960	7567760	uh right off the bat uh close to one wait what are you spades just throw for spades
7567760	7574160	spades you are my queen stony stop it refling what you want me you'll make kiss you take that
7574160	7579520	refling what you're gonna do about it well we throw for spades okay we throw for spades
7580560	7585840	in the name of the spades we throw i'm gonna that's spades
7588320	7590240	in the name of the spades we throw
7598640	7600640	uh huh
7607440	7612160	play the trash okay i'll play the trash i read play the trash i'm playing
7614080	7622080	yeah yeah oh wait okay i know this looks crazy but let me just play it for the money and then
7622080	7630400	we'll do a thingy we need that money don't worry we've got it we've got it go
7634640	7641680	ta-da see we got it see you are worried about nothing okay we definitely if we could get a card
7641680	7648960	that goes for like a flushes three of a canes no straight no we want flushes
7649280	7658960	what am i doing okay i think we just need a you want a standard pack okay
7661200	7670800	ooh fancy cards we've got a foil stone a planet if it's held money if the card is held
7671760	7674400	creates a turret when discarded
7676320	7680480	or we can use it as a multiplier in a scary situation
7682400	7685520	because three fours at the time won't discard any given card okay
7686240	7694240	so clubs ace of clubs may come in clutch for safety so he's now at 1.5 uh what's arena do
7694240	7696160	oh it's a turret anything else
7699600	7705840	kiki or dago next we can take the arcana you want it
7708880	7713280	what's our we've got hearts this round it won't cost us an interest this is true
7715600	7720720	uh could make our deck better let's see what we're looking at strength increase a rank
7721680	7729920	a wild card a two planet cards maybe we maybe doubles money which is not good enough at the
7729920	7736240	moment or a glass honestly i'm kind of like planet wild card wild card oh you want wild
7736240	7743760	cards sorry okay wild card on queen plant or wild card wild card is consistency
7744240	7748400	guaranteed joker proc wild or hermit i am all
7749840	7752880	i'd say ace but it doesn't matter that much at the end of the day okay
7754480	7760960	ace into a wild card okay and then we go next we're not doing that
7761600	7768960	uh i'm definitely gonna invest in any planet cards that are for flushes because this is
7768960	7777360	literally the only thing keeping us going right now we can skip for a 1.5 joker
7779440	7784640	yeah i agree okay let's see what we're up against discard two random cards per hand
7785440	7788000	ooh we can get a turret if we want right now
7790320	7797520	we don't have a suit so not oh wow we have a four of a cane that's rare
7799200	7803440	i don't like ever get that and then we'll just throw the the the six away
7805040	7811120	what is your joker asking for hearts and that's only playing one heart so we can roll for more hearts
7813440	7816960	i believe through you want me to play the ace leave the six
7821360	7827680	we want to hunt a heart flush i mean that's only removing one heart if we do four of a kind
7827680	7836240	60 times 7 times 1.5 times a little 1.5 here and it's 9k oh we're gonna make it
7838160	7845120	wait if it's 9k can i destroy it i want to discard it like right now what did i get increase the

8214400	8221760	really bothered about choose one of up to four joker cards and choose one of up to three playing
8221760	8229840	cards maybe the playing cards one um i mean we definitely could have had a better joker to hit
8229840	8234560	yeah but i mean we got an extra joker slot and we get a lot of bonus for pairs if we want
8235520	8245360	standard pack because it will upgrade hologram okay oh what are you you're so shiny hold on i'm
8245360	8251920	taking a little hydration please hydrate a little briefly splurge a little because you get no discounts

8273520	8284560	get a joker but we take as below the uh interest take the buffoon okay okay let's see what jokers
8284560	8292640	in stock come on oh right create a turret if you're poor earn two bucks if you don't use this card so

8318160	8325840	what are we looking at feed it upcoming okay start with zero discards this is going to be curious
8325920	8334240	but you never know i'm sure this will go fine we have to win three hands go for flushes okay
8335520	8340080	i can do it 10 000 no discards by the way
8344160	8350800	so i can throw out a pair and hope to get a flush back i'll speak oh wait no hold on sorry

8386720	8393920	them add double the rank of the lowest card no and no it's a suit so it prox everything that's
8393920	8401600	fantastic okay i assume standard is going to upgrade our lovely hologram so let's get a
8401600	8407120	little invest in my gating what's inside uh we have a wild card
8409840	8415760	very valuable i'm tempted to pick up the wild card yeah i agree i agree wild card and then

8825840	8835040	we have increased the rank enhances two selected cards have bonus clubs gives the total sell value
8835040	8841360	of all the jokers currently 17 bucks so 17 bucks i don't want that either so full no
8842720	8845680	temperance easy money i am inclined to believe
8847680	8853280	temperance yep okay we've got we've just raised our economy artificially i'm very happy we will go
8853280	8860000	next i may not be able to talk all the time but i'm always here oh don't worry you can always
8860000	8868480	lurk if you're busy and stuff i know some of you listen at work i'm on to you oh my gosh are we
8868480	8873120	going to do it in one i'm not going to play the four on purpose because it's a wild card and i can
8873120	8878480	play it on anything i think we've done it in one though boop
8883360	8891920	oh my god brah 159 for that that's so good and we got 12 bucks feels good man
8892160	8902640	oh we got blueprint hold on you sound good right um plus 17 a booster or blueprint get
8902640	8908800	blueprint okay unanimously we are getting blueprint right incompatible that's fine joker on the right
8908800	8921360	so what him i put blueprint to copy ancient joker i mean i'm here for it i think you're
8921360	8927520	giving me a wild card pt i'm so sorry yeah well we won okay i hope so right and then standard pack
8927520	8936880	again to level up um hologram he'll be times three uh he'll be times three which is pretty good both
8936880	8943360	packs mummy okay recline thank you for your help i know i might be frustrating to watch but thank you
8943360	8949200	for your patience when you watch me play games because i'm not very smart um but i feel very
8949200	8955120	accepted even though i am a dumb dumb so thank you okay back to the game i don't want to get too
8955120	8960240	emotional because i feel very accepted as a stream when i'm dumb dumb but yes i take this
8960240	8965760	okay and then uh you want me to check out the joker pack i feel like all our jokers are pretty
8965760	8971840	good unless like crafty joker can probably get swapped out for something else do you want me to
8971840	8979840	pick up jumbo i wouldn't check out just save for economy for a good role let's see what we're up
8979840	8986640	against what are we up against gives a copy of the next selected tag and then three plus lose a dollar
8986640	8996640	per hand plate that's fine right now economy doesn't matter it puts us a negative one okay let's just
8996640	9002080	go next then i think we're i think we're doing okay we're going to see what a blueprint and ancient
9002080	9007520	do together i think we have a good joker set i think it's fair to move on okay let's move on let's
9007520	9012320	just keep our our money's to ourselves right what are we looking at here what would you like
9012320	9023360	you would like hearts that is okay i am going to play uh the full house just to get rid of these
9023360	9027920	cards and out the way and then we will roll for hearts okay but we will get a little cheeky
9027920	9034800	a little cheeky dollar we do for this as well yeah and i think that is the correct play the
9034800	9045280	correct choice oh well we didn't need it but we got money though oh what are you earn a dollar
9045280	9053520	for each nine in your deck at the current round uh you know i'll take it right put a little hi cat
9053520	9062400	no uh i don't think we need anything and less cloud nine eat earn a dollar it says plus 10 multi
9062400	9067680	which is doing more than the crafty joker i'm tempted to sell crafty joker what do we think
9067680	9074640	sell crafty joker to get a little plus 10 multiplier you can hover over the left most joker
9075280	9084800	hovering although nine is money but what would we do the left you want blue joker gone
9085520	9089920	two plus chips for each remaining card in the deck i feel like blue joker does more than
9089920	9094720	what crafty joker wait no you're a flush i'm an idiot i thought that was pears for some reason
9095680	9098720	sorry i'm sorry if we want to keep playing lose the blue
9100160	9106560	okay we'll lose the blue oh okay maybe wait
9110000	9115120	i don't really need the money is the 10 plus multiplier i'm more interested in i feel like
9115120	9122080	that's doing more than chips is it not accidental overkill honestly
9125680	9130640	he's foil but cloud nine scales are multi better 10 plus multi doesn't matter
9131920	9135840	the amount of chips ain't worth it just leave it while i just leave it as it is right i'm gonna
9135840	9140960	open up my little celestial pack whilst we all have a discussion oh come on give me a flush
9141840	9147440	this game does not like me right now i mean i guess give us two pears as a
9149120	9156960	default right let's see what tarot's got in store for us hmm bonus cards hearts or select two
9156960	9161840	cards convert the left into the right this one into the left into the right
9161840	9171760	who has got the most cards clubs i could honestly probably get rid of a club
9174240	9183600	death death a two into an ace or you shoulda we don't need that much flat multi you want the
9183600	9193200	suits to be equal okay okay the base from our flush level and the ancient jokers all we need
9193200	9202400	okay so what do you do select two cards and convert the left into the right sure yay we go to aces
9202400	9208880	why not uh right we're gonna just get cloud nine i'm just gonna leave everything as is you guys are
9208880	9214320	saying we're we're good to go so i very much convert one into a bonus like i thought we were
9214320	9224320	going to do that but yeah you have too many clubs out right we are doing spades any spades
9225920	9233920	spades spades spades we love to see it unfortunately we do not have a natural you went to densi
9233920	9239200	i think the blue is worse than the nine but we'll we can probably come across something else
9239760	9245040	just throw away i mean just makes all discard at all and do speed run yes
9249280	9252640	we have a wild card so we will just play it on
9253520	9262560	mount i know it's not the flush we want but it's not the flush we want but let's play it
9263520	9271520	and we get a little penny on top 130 000 we got a penny we we got extra money we got 11 for that
9271520	9279200	what are you a steel card or spades i think our spades are really fine it's really thinking what
9279200	9286240	we don't like uh we could do a steel card i mean don't really see why not choose two the playing
9286240	9291440	cards to add okay so that's gonna level him up spade flush would cost us the clean money
9291520	9294640	who cares at this point actually yeah you're kind of right i feel like we've got enough
9294640	9301040	economy going on what are you you have a chance one in five chance for a plus 20
9301040	9307680	ah the queen money was better lucky money yeah take lucky money okay i'll take
9308720	9316000	zui 69 oh you stop oh can i take them both oh no it's like okay and then a nine
9316080	9321680	take this okay so now he's 3.5 and then he's what about to be four
9323600	9329280	we have a jack multi and a queen i assume is the the dream team
9331600	9337840	i'm going for it if it's wrong you may hang draw and quarter me okay and then i'll buy the steel
9339040	9344320	and i'll hold on to the steel and we don't really need a consumable slot to be honest
9346480	9351920	uh jack of clubs and money queen money right what are we up against is the question
9352640	9355920	upcoming lose a dollar every hand plays
9359680	9365760	i see a wild wild card what would you like you would like diamonds you most certainly can have
9365760	9371760	diamonds so i am going to purposely get rid of you to give us a turret and we are going to roll
9371760	9380640	for diamonds discard we've got the hermit doubles money i mean she i'll take it right
9380640	9384800	diamonds one two three four five let's go
9392240	9399360	that's that's silly that's silly one million for that hand that is so silly
9399360	9407600	it gives the total sell value so what spend two dollars to make 18
9411040	9416160	oh this is getting so silly i'm here for it right sure let's see what's in the standard pack
9417600	9424080	what are we looking at money or money right who is the weakest diamond oh
9424880	9428480	hearts is actually getting pretty far behind i might be better off playing him

9559280	9568560	all face cards work with smiley oh okay wait played face cards give five plus
9569200	9577200	but if it considers all cards are considered a face so smiley in parodolia not the blue joker sorry
9580480	9586800	these aren't good enough to swap out yet we have better chip sources than four joker that is blue
9588880	9592000	no blue prints too it will be when i get rid of blue print
9595680	9601440	they'll leave it that just leave it i mean we're winning we're literally doing like 100 a pot right

9626720	9629440	oh this is what i'm worried about when the game starts doing this to me
9634720	9640960	oh i don't like when the game does this to me you want clubs i have two clubs and no more
9641040	9646240	so i just keep throwing them away keep the queen we have to continue dig dig dig i'm digging a hole
9647040	9652320	i know but we'll have two discards left let's just keep fishing okay discard diamond queen and keep
9652320	9663200	digging discard diamond queen oh i really don't like the way this is shaping two is enough wait

9688880	9698640	didn't want to happen and it happened look how many spades are sitting in the deck 17 spades are
9698640	9706240	lurking in the shadows okay the odds of us not rolling is astronomical this has to work
9710000	9714480	this game has nothing but the audacity are you serious
9717040	9724640	16 spades sitting hiding in that deck and i have to play a fishy two appears
9728960	9735920	we have a full house play the trash i know you guys are saying full house but if we do a club we
9735920	9746320	win we do a club flush we win mommy you'll get 10k tomorrow really i've not been uploading any ace
9746320	9752240	smart though how i don't know how i'm getting traction i don't know i don't know if the full
9752240	9763840	house will be enough ace ace 4 4 4 no that's rub it sorry i uh i right let me just be bad we
9763840	9768800	have three rounds we can play let me just be let me be transparent let me be bad at the game okay
9768800	9778320	let me just submit that's what i want okay one two three four five i want to know
9780640	9783840	yeah you're gaining traction by being a cutey

9826960	9829520	choose a tarot card right we're gonna start using these
9831040	9837200	uh a steel card let's just shove it on anything i guess right there's less
9837760	9840800	uh the hearts and the spades have actually evened up what do you want next you want a
9840800	9846240	spade of course you want the the smallest one right bonus cards ace and a king become a bonus
9846240	9852560	focus focus you are a bonus that's fine uh chariot steel card what do we put the steel on
9852560	9860240	flushes really are okay great cards but hard to find it hold chariot for an emergency understood
9860320	9868560	right we have planets luck enhancing to two lucky cards i wouldn't mind luck luck is kind of fun
9871120	9875440	diamond we've already got enough diamonds on the deck mommy is our biggest hitter ever
9875440	9879920	but you're winning so hard you could just be one harder okay let's do luck forget if we roll a lucky
9879920	9887600	card i'm like although i'm here for it not steel glass that's not glass like steel
9889760	9895280	just use luck or we could roll for planet but we might not get anything we want that's the problem
9895280	9906080	with planet just do luck okay let's do come back okay and then re-roll three of a kind we don't need
9906080	9914320	three of a kind we don't need one in four chance no one more re-roll one plus hand size honestly
9914320	9925200	all flushes and streets can be made with four car reeflings reeflings is this the card we want
9928160	9935520	is this the card we won yes you want it we want it we don't need it we always get the flush
9935520	9938240	well only because we're throwing so much as such a way
9940800	9943120	follow your heart scrawny i feel like
9945280	9947440	um what would we trade for it though
9950560	9957040	i think crafty joker he only gives 80 plus chips you he gives more chips blue joker gives more
9957040	9963040	than crafty four card flushes also don't score as well not that you need to believe in the heart of
9963200	9967040	car
9968160	9973440	blue joker makes probably makes more than crafty crafty or blue doesn't matter both are shite
9973440	9981680	sell crafty okay thank you crafty you have been fantastic wait what am i being an idiot
9981680	9989600	all flushes and streets can be made with four cards let's see what are gonna happen because
9989600	9996320	that's very unique um okay next round what are you
9999360	10005600	okay what would you like you would like space you'll never guess i've rolled one space so if i
10005600	10013360	play oh i don't really want to play that what get rid of them because i don't want this is a 1.5 if
10013360	10021280	it stays in my hand can you show your deck all yours baby the four only gives you consistent
10021280	10024880	it could be a lifesaver ditch all but the seal
10027360	10034080	and queen yes agreed east guard we'll go for a diamond flush even though it's not exactly what
10034080	10043520	we want but so that work see it counts as a flush so what happens if i play a four only flush
10046480	10056800	oh it didn't like that it didn't like that um curious i'll keep that in mind it didn't like it
10056800	10063440	but it could save us in a in a very rough time oh well okay we should just go for the flush of
10063440	10071280	whatever card it's asking for that is insane retrigger each blade multi multi well we might be
10071280	10078080	able to get uh was it jupiter three of a kind two pair four of a kind this game really does not like
10078080	10084480	me i got a sport 5k well off which is pretty strong to be the suit with that ancient joker yeah
10084800	10092800	yeah oh just grab any old thing and then another one just because we can flush
10094480	10100160	wow black holes hidden in here but we play flushes because they're all the same colors
10100160	10105600	so we flush it down the toilet that's right that's how i remember what flushes oh no you guys are
10105600	10119040	saying black hole oh i'm sorry i'm sorry i got so focused on the thing that's fine we're doing
10119040	10125680	flushes anyway okay extra large veins let's go what would you like you would like diamonds today
10125680	10133120	oh you'll never guess what card i didn't pull some of the fucking diamonds i think just
10134400	10143280	what throw everything for diamonds wait no hold on what am i doing there's already a suit in here
10143280	10152640	should i just play the suit i still have three hands anyway club flush yeah i feel like we have
10152640	10159040	enough rounds for it i know i can get a turret if i discard him but me oh no destroy the ace okay
10159040	10166240	i'll destroy this discard the ace and these and see what happens when did i get temperance
10166240	10174640	gives me money okay this is what i didn't want we are getting the diamonds but yeah now we're up
10174720	10175360	Greek
10180720	10186800	nine how do you spot that that's insane what did you spot nine nine nine
10189760	10198000	queen and five player throw a player discard i don't know any of these words just enjoy the
10198000	10204400	accent let it let it flow through you how to see clubs in a scotch accent clubs discard them
10205600	10216480	could make some dosh i don't know but play them okay fuck it up now if we don't roll diamond
10216480	10221680	yeah i was gonna say this game's target and this one two three four five just a double check diamond
10221680	10228560	let's go let's go leave it to me i see someone's got real addicted to this game it's such a good
10228560	10236880	game i love it oh my god two million are you joking we made two million on that that's ridiculous
10239440	10244800	it does nothing no redeem it please i want it i've still not unlocked what's inside that

10251280	10259520	flush that's exactly what we want yes wait cells are for eight she redeemed literally all that
10259520	10267760	frustration and then it paid off oh fancy right what are we looking at we have we need a heart
10267760	10274400	or a spade to start even and stuff up so i guess a spade ten plus money creates a planet card for
10274400	10283680	final if it's hell sure oh you want you want spade you want spade two viewers are streaming their
10283680	10292160	addiction right now sad that they fell that i love that ace diamond ace diamond for the target cards
10293040	10299440	we don't have a flat multi either ace is fine i was gonna do the spade to try and even up because
10300240	10306240	uh spades are 14 in the hand which is a bit hard if the multiplier asks for it
10306240	10315680	it's last ante ace spade yeah we're at 4.5 um we trigger all cards for the next ten hands
10315680	10323040	well i don't have room for you but re-roll weren't you when blind is selected destroy joker to the
10323120	10331520	right and permanently double its value yeah re-roll none of these are good one more re-roll boom
10332880	10340640	judgment creates a random joker bonus card why not why not each played king of diamonds gives
10342640	10345520	keep rolling is this the last round i'm not going crazy
10345520	10355840	oh very large blind 300 we are we make that in one go i'm not sure i'm nervous for this one

10362480	10372400	four of a kind no discarded no right one more i'll come on oh flush very lucky fushy
10373360	10384240	okay well one more and no 29 and then four bucks some more we're to spend on okay wild cat oh

10464320	10470720	unfortunately not what we want to just shove on anything straight flush because the four
10470720	10474800	jokers honestly it's funny because it was a straight flush because you only needed four oh
10474800	10483920	oops i forgot how many we've got 14 we need another hearts and all honesty but i mean it's all right
10484720	10491600	we can just take it i'm not really too worried now that we have the other thing um now one more
