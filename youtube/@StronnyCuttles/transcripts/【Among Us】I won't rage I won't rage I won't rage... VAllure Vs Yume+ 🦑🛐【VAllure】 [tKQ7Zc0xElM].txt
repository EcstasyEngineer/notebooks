Oh my God.
Welcome to the Via Lour and Yuma Plus Collab
where we are scuffed even through the beginning,
even though we met an hour before
and set this all up.
It was more than an hour.
It's giving poopy.
Speaking of poopy, let me go.
Alright poopy, take it away.
Take it away, take it away.
Hi me, I am Yuma Plus Special Generation Remedy.
I'm a virtual playing doctor, nice to meet you.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
Hi.
Why do I feel like I'm an alcohol synonymous?
Oh.
Here we go again.
I'm rain and I'm the problem.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
But like seriously, who are you?
Now for Via Lour.
Hey, I'm Sterani, I'm Scottish.
You can't mix my voice up with anyone in this lobby
and I will not tolerate otherwise, thank you.
Yeah, Sterani.
Yay.
Yay.
Okay, I'll go.
Hello, my name is Mercy MoDeece from Via Lour,
gen one in gold.
In gold.
Yay, nice to meet you.
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.
That's it.
Lour, I'll go.
I'm a Lour Delay

I'll be a lour.
Yay.
Nice to meet you, mommy.
Yay.
What's up?
I'm Sheezy Cottonbum, but you can call me

Yay.
That was lit.
That was lit.
Okay.
Okay, now that introductions are done.
Wait, is introductions done?
Yeah, can we kill each other now?
Yeah, get out.
Bye.
Screw you guys.
I'm off to do the freaking alien thing.
No, I'm not.
Are you upset?
Did you hear?
Oh my god, she's good.
I need to do
the garbage shoot.
Hold on.
Are you guys okay?
You know, it's yourself, man.
I need the garbage.
Do you want to go do the
cars with me?
Three, two, one,
go!
Who's dead?
Can you hear them now?
It was Amy.
It was Amy.
Oh my gosh.
Amy's at the garbage shoot.
Amy's at the garbage shoot.
I literally just saw her.
I just came from communication.
And Amy is
standing over the body of rain.
Holy crap.
Holy crap.
No, don't even fucking lie.
I'm sorry, but you're into...
You didn't. Is that the best shot?
Sorry, if that's the best you've got.
That's the best you've got.
I walked in on it.
It's literally
Amy.
It's the Sonic Heroes.
Fucking Shadow Roleplayer.
Yeah, okay.
The only guilty thing I have
to admit is that I like Shadow,
but I didn't. I didn't do this.
I promise.
Can Strony set you up?
Yeah, absolutely.
Set you up? Are you fucking having a laugh?
Amy, are you joking?
I was literally at the gas canister
watching you as you got pulled over
and then fucking sniped
rain in half.
It's like left behind.
I'm sorry, but that was a cure...
Open up my stream.
Open up my stream right now.
I'm not being gas-lipped
by a Sonic...
a freaking Shadow the Hedgehog streamer
right now.
I am not being gas-lipped
by a Sonic the Hedgehog
stand.
You're getting done.
I will say that I did see
Amy stand over the body.
Amy immediately just being like
fuck you now, that's not fair.
I didn't do this.
I'm sorry, but you seem
suspicious.
Right now, believe me, my baby girl,
I would never, I would never
have to fly.
If it's not Amy, I'm voting
for Strony next round.
Wait, why am I getting in trouble?
Obviously, it's going to say imposter.
You're so passionate.
You're actually welcome for doing half of the work.
I'll go find the other imposter while you're at it.
I'll do it. I'll try my best.
Damn, Strony, I fucking love you.
Pigeonino?
I've heard the tune, but you don't give a damn.
See you in death, baby girl.
Wait, what?
Wait, you didn't do it!
You didn't do it!
Wait, she didn't do it!
Mother.
Mother.
Wait, wait, Mercy,
Mercy said she saw it.
Mercy reported.
I walked in.
I walked in.
I don't know about this.
What?
What? I just walked in.
I'm going to go do my shit.
If somebody kills me, it was Strony.
Wait, I'm not fucking doing it.
Mercy!
Mercy, no!
Guys, guys, I'm having a little issue.
You're cheating nasty whore.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I didn't see anything.
Hold on.
Can you guys hear me?
Yeah, can you use her?
I feel so betrayed, man.
Where are you?
My atoll.
We're so hurt by this development.
I didn't see anything.
In my defense, Amy, what kind of defense is I didn't do it?
You had no alibi.
Yeah.
The candlestick was in the lounge.
The billiard room had the freaking pool queue.
And it was like, what was that alibi?
I didn't do it.
Oh, we got a play pro punt on D mode.
Clue.
Clue reference.
That was horrible. I hated every second of that.
I love Shadow the Hedgehog.
Literally, I was like, I'm being accused
by a shadow the Hedgehog lover.
I don't know.
I mean, we can't let Sonic the Hedgehog
go down without fight.
It's not Sonic, it's Shadow!
Oh my god, please, get away!
Whatever the hell his name is, whatever the hell his name is.
They both begin with.
Oh, thank god.
Hopefully, this time, I'll actually be imposter.
I'm coming for you, Johnny.
If you're fucking coming for me, I'm coming up.
You, goodbye.
Oh, man.
I'll be a good little girl.
I'll do my test.
Okay, let's try it now.
Wait, where's the map?
Oh, where the fuck is the map?
I need to fix the wiring.
Why are they not highlighting it?
I need to do the asteroid.
Hey, Johnny.
You're pretty funny last round.
Ask the gun to move in that gaslight.
Right, we're playing gal.
Wait, why is the game sound so quiet?
Guys, I'm going to have to turn up the game sound, unfortunately.
Because that should not be making such a tiny little noise.
It's fine, it's fine.
Unlock manifolds.
A reactor, electrical, divert power to security.
Oh god, what is that?
Divert power?
Is he divert power?
Oh my god, I love the map.
The map, the map, the map.
Right, we're going to admin.
What do I report?
Oh, yes.
What the hell?
What the hell?
I was doing it.
I was doing it.
It shadowed the hedgehog.
Let me talk.
Okay, found the body.
Let the rabbit speak.
So I was doing electrical.
It was coming from electrical.
Actually, I don't know where the map works.
Hold on, let me look at the map.
You can open up the map.
I walked up near and in between reactor and security.
If that were the body.
I am going to vouch for Rhea in pink.
Because she was near me all the way in navigation.
I saw her go in the opposite direction.
So I think Rhea is fine.
Yeah, yeah, he coughed at me.
So Strony, Rhea and Mercy are vouching for one another.
Shebi is claiming she saw it.
So Azura, Mamosa and Rain, you all look in Suss's book.
What do you guys have to say for yourselves?
I have to say something.
I was in...
It was not me.
Because I saw...
How do we know?
How do we know it wasn't you?
Because I was with Strony.
Then I went to security and I saw what happened.
I didn't see who killed.
Well, it was in between security.
Yeah, but I...
It was in between security and Reactor.
No, I did see Rain and Admin.
So Azura and Mamosa are now the most likely suspects.
Unless Shebi, you're playing mind game.
So Azura, Mamosa and Shebi are all Suss now.
Unless Ventilation was taken in Electrical.
Which, unfortunately, I don't know.
I don't believe a word you say, Azura.
Well, I'm innocent.
I was sitting at the table.
I was sitting at the table because I'm having audio issues.
I can balance.
I can balance.
Okay.
I don't know who to vote for then.
I'm gonna vote for Mamosa.
Sorry, Mamosa, but you're the most likely target at the moment.
Okay.
Wait, who was the person that said they walked to security?
I'm gonna skip because I don't know who to vote for.
It was me.
Azura and Mamosa have abstained from voting.
How fucking curious.
I'm just wondering.
What do you guys do?
What do I do to you?
Right, let's find out.
Mamosa was an imposter.
Azura is the most fucking likely.
I'm keeping an eye on her.
It's impossible.
But they're no fucking getting me in these mind games.
I know how these games work.
I'm fucking energetic.
What happens is the lights are off and they don't work.
Wait.
Whoa.
One, two, three, four.
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Oh my god, I'm so smart.
Electrical.
More like, electricate my music.
Mommy's been so aggressive.
I think it's the lights.
Okay, look. Thank you.
Unless it's Mercy, I bet.
What?
Why?
It's not me.
It's not me.
It's not me.
It's not me.
She's getting nervous.
She's getting nervous.
It's not working.
I think it's rain.
Yeah, it's rain.
It's not rain.
So it's both.
Right.
We do kind of need to breathe oxygen.
Not going to lie.
We need a cheeky bit of oxygen.
Very fucking curious.
It wasn't.
Wait a moment.
Who was attacking you?
It's fucking Mercy.
Oh my god, guys.
Mercy walked by me and disappeared into the nether.
I do believe it might be her.
No, I was walking too.
What was the area on the left?
I was right next to you when you
I was alone
with Rain and Rea
and Strawny.
I was with
Rain. I think it was Rain.
Yeah, it was Rain.
It's Mercy.
No, it's not.
It's freaking you.
No, it's not. I can't believe you would do such a thing to me.
Oh, is there, I'm sorry.
Oh, okay.
It would make sense
why Mercy would vote.
Oh.
Oh!
Yay!
Yeah, let's go!
Oh, fantastic.
Game play, fucking flow.
I actually like to approve it
because the pressure of being a poster is hard.
I'm sorry.
I probably could have killed.
Mercy walked right past me
and I'm surprised you didn't kill me then
because I was just talking to myself
with a weirdo.
I just wanted to.
I wanted to let you all live.
I'm sorry.
Look at me being so kind as an imposter,
letting you live.
You're not kind.
I'm not accepted.
I'm red, not blue, goddamn.
Jesus.
I'm lying. I forgive you.
I can never be mad.
All right.
Do my task and shake my hand.
Hi, I'm with garbage shooters.
Garbage shooters.
I'm sorry about last time.
Please don't kill me.
We're doing the garbage shoot boys.
Taking out the garbage.
I don't know what any of this stuff is.
I'm going to be honest.
I'm scared.
This is closed. I'm so scared.
Oh, there you go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why are you...
You're fine.
You're fine.
I'm traumatized.
Hold on a minute.
Amy is in
fucking electrical
and who does something upon?
Who are we? Ria's dead body again.
Oh, no.
She's a victim.
I literally opened the door
because the door just got closed in my face.
Me and...
I'm fucking on the outside.
And then Amy comes out
and then I go in to the back of the vent section
and Ria's sitting dead with her retort.
No, listen.
Amy,
do you have to say for yourself?
Did you tell me to kill myself?
No, what do you have to say for yourself?
Not that.
I mean, if you want to...
I can't stop you.
I was doing electricals.
Yes, you were because that's where you killed her.
She just admitted.
She just admitted.
She was...
Strony, I think you're making money.
Strony, when you get like this...
Strony, when you get like this...
No, because I know...
Wait, no.
When Strony came and opened the door,
I screamed because you scared me.
No, listen to...
Listen to Amy.
She literally goes.
She literally goes.
I was in electrical.
It's like breaking her microphone.
She literally goes.
She literally goes.
I was in electrical.
I tell you, I find the dead body of Rhea in electrical
and you go, oh, it's Strony.
I'm abstaining.
All right, then.
All right, then.
She goes, I'm in electrical.
I like how nobody's questioning us.
I know it's Amy.
Wait, wait.
I don't know.
If it's Amy, it also might be Mamosa
because Mamosa was cornering me
and she saw them walking together.
I was chilling with you.
No, I have not seen Azura.
Where's her body?
Probably by the table again.
Probably by the table.
She got the table.
I saw Azura talking.
I saw Azura talking.
I saw Azura talking.
It was rain.
Excuse me, what was that, Marcy?
Wait, who?
Who the fuck is for me?
Marcy.
Marcy's voting for me.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my God.
Wait, Marcy's voting for me.
Marcy.
Marcy's voting for me.
Right, go do tasks if you want to win
or don't do tasks if you want to freaking die.
Oh, my God, Azura's we bit.
Pet over here.
Marcy's voting for me.
I'm voting for Marcy.
What for me?
Na na no.
No, Marcy's voting for me.
So when you see me floating in space
and I can't even play the game.
It's Marcy.
When it goes, oh, when
when床y is in Poster,
vote Marcy because she's gonna vote for me
last time it was Susie Baka.
No.
Wait, no, Marcy always
votes for the person that accuses her
when she's a posture
If you want to lose this crew mate have none, but I'm here at win and you guys
We know it's not she be
Right when I float away in space and it says
Ronnie was a wee crew mate everyone turned to merci and vote for her. Thank you very much. I rest my frickin case
I'm no having it
I
Because mercy will accuse someone and vote for somebody who is who is the imposter and accusing her
Back and then scrawny gets so defensive
Have a midget as a pet
Oh
I can't wait to murder
My god, why am I imposter again?
Oh my god
I like to I can hear
What's a buddy, so who wants my buddy?
I'm doing the garbage you desu
I'm gonna get absolutely ruled by Amy is gonna be gunning for me if she was an imposter
I'm glad we gonna for myself as well when my attitude is absolutely stinking in this game. I have to admit
I'm taking nothing but the pain
They legit are must be like so sick and screaming so you know what we're gonna do next then
We're gonna know and we're gonna be calm and we're gonna laugh
Okay, they're tickling each other behind over here they're tickling each other behind the bin
I
Sorry, I'm getting chased by mercy halfway across the canteen. I'm just here for a scoop of food
I'm not I'm not gonna lie. I'm just here for a wee bit of food. You just leave me alone
I actually you know what if you're imposter you should come for me first cuz I'm gonna figure out who the
Right who's dead as there came from here. So there's a dead body in here. It's a zero
Right, but there's no dead body
So we can't approve we can't actually prove
Right check in Azura did come from here. We're actually gonna be a cheeky we that and pop on cameras, right? Okay. Okay, we're motion
Right Amy and Azura together right, but my motion here. Oh, everyone's fucking cleaned up
Right Azura and Amy can get a kill on each other right now if they're feeling confident enough
They're having a wee giggle. They're having a wee laugh. Azura is holding back not really doing any tasks. I don't like what I'm seeing
We are going to do the last oh, sorry, I can count numbers one, two
Six of them eight nine ten
Okay, lovely. We're gonna go back on cameras because these imposters think they're gonna get the better of me absolutely fucking
Right, we see it Azura and Amy together again
Interesting interesting they two seem to be hugging one another
Mamosa has come out come out rails now coming my way I repeat rea is now coming my way
Not the good way rea is not coming. Oh shit. Oh, you're pissed. Oh, you can't
What I'm fucking are you going for me? Be honest. I think I think I think I think you're going a little skit
I'm actually gonna get done by real. She's so cute. She's gonna be done. I'm gonna say thank you by the end of it
She'd be
Hold on right and I'm Amy again are on their own
I kind of trust Strelny
My task someone comes I'm a little scared of she be
I'm observing my my elf eyes are open camera. Oh god. She's going down into I believe med bay
She be out of med bay
Incredibly quickly timing on she be coming out of med bay almost as if uninterested in any test meriskay is fucking over me
I'm getting nervous
Me
Only rain I found rain dead in the back of electrical nobody was nearby
But I have a feeling it might be rea and Azura because they like to sit what with each other
They like a whole pants cuz they're go
And rea together no, I saw yeah
And then I was with Azura and then she became a mocked in on us
Well, that doesn't mean they couldn't have vented from electrical to
Mercy are very
Lately I've had to do the time in order to do electrical unless Mercy vented from below
But I actually wait did I see you come on cameras from I don't think that would make any sense. I think it's Azura
I'm sorry
I'm going
We fucking cams together for half the fucking round. Are you joking? I've already done on my time
I'm about to get ruled by rayon
Yeah, cuz I've already done on my task. They don't take that long. I mean I saw my tasks, but I'm really scared
No, I don't do that. I'll stay on count. Oh, Mary's is gonna fucking wallop me
I don't trust me either. She's fucking larkin and we can talk
She was the imposter and so I was like bye
Amy's actually going to save
Mamosa is following Amy so whatever happens in that room Mamosa and Amy are confirmed to be together. Yeah, piss off
I knew it was you
I knew
I
Did you run so slowly
You know
It doesn't take five seconds to type in a code
Okay, well, I guess we'll see I'll guess we'll see
Mosa if it's if it's not her
The person that's trying to kill you
Maybe you guys are both
Posters, I don't trust either one of you now
Like a sassy vodka social beat
Only people I trust here
I'm gonna stop accusing

Okay, okay, let her say her piece
Dude she be looking right man, dude, no, I think it's rain
Different it's a pitch lower
I'm skipping my boat. I'm I can't I'm upstanding. I'm upstaining
Lily walked away not knowing where I was going
Listen if the imposter wins you guys are gonna lose okay, all right, that's all I have to say
I
Know mercy mercy didn't know where she was going
That was such a quick fucking round like bro, but I didn't even have time to gather any information
We downloaded this like proximity chat thing so we can like only hear each other when we get close
Obviously it means we can like scream at each other when we're playing the game. It's just really fun
Or I think it's funny. I thought it was cute
Maybe yeah, I'm talking about proximity chat to the reeflings
Yeah, I was gonna say the hover and around I didn't really
Call it
She was she comes and does need any hand. I'm like
Did you get
No, I got killed by rain. It's raining. I'm me. Oh
My god, of course they get put together
Oh, yeah, I'm hot in you. Oh

But mercy was in the hallway
I had walked all the way from weapons through cafeteria and then found her body there
Where Rayo, Rayo, where did you come from? I went from so I went in the circle
I went from admin to down and then through I think it's
So you were the last one to see mercy
Yeah, I was I think actually
I'm voting rain because she's a sure yes
Voting rain
Listen, I'm pretty sure it's rare
Okay, I was shooting asteroids as her you saw me sit in there and walk by sitting there

I don't think it's I I don't know anyone that I know it's I me is one of them
Yes, I freaking know I I me had every chance to kill me. We were alone so many times
I watched her do the oxygen
Maybe
Rain cannot lie. I think she's grooming you. I think it's a Zura and rain
I
I did I did see you walk past me, but you could have looked back around you might have been waiting for your moment
Because I literally ran past
A rain and no, it's not I don't think it's I think it's actually I me
I don't think it's a Zura at all. I think it's I me and rea. Oh shit
Get out of here

Now we just gotta get
Okay, then who's it gonna be who's gonna be
I mean, I mean
Uh, if they kill one of us

Gas is abuse

I really cannot hear. Oh, well, you don't need audio to play this game. Are you're sitting? Of course not
Someone echoing
Who is echoing?
I would need it. One's game is echoing. Oh, what's my joke? What's my ta- oh, na na

When I actually have the chance to actually like pay attention.
What is her up to?
What did I have?
Cause I spent the entire game fucking with other shit.
And now I get to finally play.
Yeah.
Yes.
If Azura is in the posture, I'm really going to commit.
I'm smart.
I'm not a postage.
No, she wasn't.
You can tell by the tone of her voice.
Yeah, they weren't going to double us.
Yeah.
They weren't going to double us.
Thank God, Azura, you saved us.

Yes, she was.

I forgot
She has like an actual place to live
And doesn't live in her basement like me
I like how her kitchen is right next to her desk
That's cool
I want food right next to me all the time
Honestly Rhea was too good
I like believed her
I believed her
Rhea you're so freaking innocent
She's such a good liar
You're capable of anything
She doesn't even like change the tone of her voice
You're just so innocent
You didn't change your tone of voice at all
When lying
Oh why is my peeing dancing like that
You see that I went all the way up to 300
Mane's at 200 by default
Never trust Rhea
I can't tell
She's one of the few people I can't tell
You can tell really good mercy
You caught on to me
My mouth is dry
I'm sorry Rain
I just noticed your voice
Thank you Shibbe
My mouth is dry
I believed her to the end as well
Get ass I believed Raina to the end
I can never tell if she's a fanatic
Is she ever lying or not
I can never tell if she's lying or not
I can tell because she's real defensive
Every time you don't let someone finish
It feels like you're being defensive
And not letting the person speak
So you're deflecting
So I assume that you're the
You gotta let me
You gotta let me explain
Because you're lying
Fight fight fight
You gotta let me explain why
And then you have to tell me why I'm wrong
Honestly if you listen to what I know
I'm gonna go through it that way
Because you voted too quickly
So let me
Well yeah because you didn't let me speak
Honestly I wanted to
I wanted to
I thought scrawny was suspicious anyways
It just feels good
It's super sad
What am I gonna do?
Right, scrawny is suspicious
I see how it is
That's it, you'll get that
That's it, I'll be your member
It's funny
It's suspicious
It's a 40 days, no pain
It's what they deserve
A 40 days
What they deserve
40 days, 20 nights
You make push scrawny
You're a really good guy
You're the cold suspension
We're not gonna lie
You're really good at gaslighting
So I'll say one thing
The girls have never seen me
At any other type of motion
They're more than happy
And proud of their work
So playing among us
When I'm screaming down the make
Being like, it's fucking da
Is probably quite a surprise for them
It is
I was just like
Honestly, yeah
I expected it
Nice and refreshed, Daniel
Trouble from school
I wanna
I wanna see Azura and Rhea
Or scrawny and Rhea team up
That's what I wanna see
That'd be funny
Scrawny and Rhea
I haven't gotten imposter once
You've not been imposter?
Yeah, guys, let's give Azura a chance
Okay
Let's give Azura imposter
The statistics of Azura being imposter
Are very high now
Just to keep that in mind
Yeah
Probability statistics
Just for everyone
Don't do that
See, look, she's gaslighting
I'm gonna get killed
She says things like this
See, they're funny
This is how I get killed
They're all fine to mess with
I'm eating goldfish
I'm eating goldfish
A snack that smiles best
That's a regular kind of goldfish
She says scrawny
Because she says the suss is shit ever
Her names are Rhea
She's a screw
Oh no, my hair is thick
Again
I'm sick of being a crewmate
I'm gonna be
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Who said that?
Clean the leaves out of the filter
What are you looking for
There's nothing here for you
Alright, I'm talking to my cat
Nice, Ronnie
Okay, sorry
I'm like, are you doing any tests, Shuby?
Or are you just like pulling me right now?
No
Oh, take your time
I'll protect you
Go someplace
Wow
Okay, I did it
Yay
I'm a shiny safe
I did swipe card
We just did the swipe card
Yeah
Right, okay
Electrical, please
Excuse me, my lovely wife
I have to go to
Electrical too
Okay, okay, be safe in here
Safety in numbers
Safety in numbers
Wait, where's the body?
Where is the other body?
Oh my god
Oh my god, holy shit
What happened?
I was about to report
Wait, where was everyone?
I was about to report
Wait, where's my...
Shuby, Shuby, Shuby
Where was she found the body?
Raya was literally with me
And Strani as well
I saw Strani
I passed by those two
I was in electrical
There was a body there
Wait
Well
First of all
Wait
Excuse me
Secondly
I was shooting asteroids
And I walked down
And there was a body at oxygen
And it was Mimosa
She was probably doing like a little shoot
Is anyone being a navigation
Or to our weapons?
Yes or no?
No
Yes
No
I was in cafeteria
I was about to do electrical
Wait, who was cafeteria?
I know it's Strani
I just know it's Strani
I just know it's Strani
Bro, you fucking...
Wait, hold on a minute
Hold on a minute
I say who's been near weapons O2 navigation
Because you have reported the body
And where O2
And you automatically go to Strani
Sorry
I know you love playing these mind games
Being like, Strani, Strani, Strani
But get to...
No, no, no, no
You're the only one
It's Strani
It's fucking she
I mean, hold on
It's Strani
No, no, no, no
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Wait, hold on
Notice how I'm nice and calm
And she's freaking out
And that's all I'm gonna say
I'm reaching on me when you
Self-reported the body
When you're the only person
Who's been witnessing weapons O2 navigation
Fucking rain
Clearly because the body was there
For a lot longer
Yeah, it could be both
The body must have been there for a while
Because no one else has been there
No one said anything
I was feeling the cafeteria
Talking to my cat
Literally all of them
And then I went and shot some asteroids
It could be Imi
Hold on, hold on, hold on
I mean, who were you with again?
I was with Reia and Strani
Was in the room with us
When we swapped the cards
Yeah, I was with Amy
In the admin room
Yeah
Did you see Reia's body?
No, I didn't
No, I didn't
No, because she was alive
And then when she walked off
And then that's...
And then I was singing a song
Going somewhere else
Aw
And then...
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I was walking to the med bay
And the round goes fast
It's Strani
Because Strani kills fast
What do you mean?
You're not...
Right
No, she could not see
I don't even know that
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Oh my god
Don't ever fucking...
Anyways, we're...
I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm scared
Now she's shooting at us
Okay, goodbye
Imi is lost
Hi
Hi
What did I say?
She's a gas voter
She's a gas voter
Can we ban her, please?
She's a gas voter
Damn you
I thought she banned her
I'm a gas voter
I'm a gas voter
Damn, I'm a gas voter
I'm a gas voter
Why does it keep making me blue?
The moment she starts getting defensive and loud
She is the impostor
She's the blue nation
Sheebie, give me the benefit of the day
You're the only person in that area
Oh my god
I killed her long ago in that area
No, that's what I mean
I'm like, I had to have happened long ago
I can't believe mommy would do this
I'm sorry about that, love
I can't believe
I wasn't planning to kill you
I didn't know
Look, look
Listen, listen
Are you serious?
Are you serious?
Are you serious?
Are you serious?
Are you serious?
Are you serious?
I wish you guys could see all the gesturing
that I'm doing right now
I knew it was you twice
I did it
Honestly, you did
I will know
She'll eat a bowl of fish
You are evil
No, I'll never be the next one
I didn't cover up
I gave you some of my chances to run away
but you kept running
I mean, a gas-riding car
When the killing goes fast
and when she gets defensive
you know what's wrong
You said that we'd double all
You said that we'd double all
No, to be fair
you were the one
I'm sorry. Press the button. Thank you. Rain starts accusing her own teammates. It's rain.
Please, I want you to feel like craved blood. I'm not fighting each other. Craved blood and death.
I tend to accuse my teammates all the time. That's just her strass to kill her teammates.
I'm going to get blamed this round as well. She's hanging about over here.
Oh no, don't die. You're so hot.
I'm doing the card. I don't have anything here. I'm scared.
Are you needing pals just to get through the game? Because it's too scary.
I'm probably going to get double gold.
That's terrifying.
They keep targeting me.
It's so accusatory.
Hello, press the button to start.
Did I just close that?
And you've got all the way to freaking electrical mode.
Who the frick is talking? I can hear someone but I don't see anyone.
I'm losing out.
Did I not just hear someone?
This kid's friendly. I need my medication.
I literally am seeing no one.
It's not either of us.
I want everyone to tell me their location right now.
I was sniffing Shuby.
She was. I was doing the beds or whatever it's called.
It's not Azura. I promise you.
Open up the map and tell me where you are.
It's Mercy. I saw her run off with Rhea.
Why did you just say that right now Amy?
I just remembered because I was laughing about sniffing Shuby.
I saw her rain.
It's not me guys.
Are you kidding me?
I'm not saying it's you. I'm saying it's rain.
Let me vouch for people. It's not Azura or Shuby.
I'm vouching for people right now.
It's definitely because Shuby was following me and then I was following Azura.
Then Amy was sniffing my ass.
I was doing the leaves.
I don't want to ditch my gen.
I don't want to accuse my gen.
You're a little bit quieter than you usually are.
Johnny, why are you so quiet?
It's rain. It's rain.
It's rain. It's rain.
Everyone has ignored my question.
Everyone identify your location on the map right now.
I'm in storage with my fellow cafeteria.
We're on our way to cafeteria.
Someone's in cafeteria.
Me and Shuby.
I was in storage with Amy.
Me, Amy.
So then Mercy and Amy then?
No.
I was literally with Shuby.
I will only say that I was not with rain the entire time.
But then Shuby was with me the other half.
The other half I was not with rain.
I don't know if it's rain or Amy.
I don't know if it's rain or Amy.
I don't know if it's rain or Amy.
I don't know.
I think it's Mercy.
Why?
I think it's Mercy and Amy.
Trust me.
Trust me.
I'm voting rain.
I don't know.
I swear to God.
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
I'm going to hold your hand the whole time.
I would like to also mention
Mercy did not defend herself
once during that execution.
Please keep that in mind.
It's Mercy.
It's Mercy and Amy.
I don't know.
It's freaking Mercy and Amy.
I don't know, man.
I don't know, man.
I don't know, man.
I am not.
My mic is not picking up as normal.
Maybe I was listening to it wrong.
Get to fuck you.
Get to fuck you're an electrical.
Get to fuck!
I knew it.
Anyway, I can complete my task as a ghost.
I was like, yeah, right.
You're an electrical.
I freaking doubt it.
I'm going to defend Ezra.
Trust.
Trust.
You need to pop that button.
Unless it's Ezra, just doing a big switch.
I'm going to...
Oh, my God.
What is going on?
What is going on?
You can follow it.
Yeah.
I'm going to Mercy.
I'm going to Mercy.
I'm going to Mercy.
I love you a little, but I knew it was Mercy, too.
I had a feeling.
I won't continue to gas like you!
When Stronny said that Mercy was quiet, that's when I knew, I was like, oh, oh, look who's low-toed now.
I knew it was no octave.
I didn't get a chance to save you.
If I get changed to blue one more time.
I saw Mercy, Mercy was the last person.
About to kill.
Mercy, I'd like to abide my time.
I knew it was Mercy because Mercy was the last one with Rhea and I was trying to tell you guys that.
No, I know you're sipping the ass of a killer.
She was following me, following Azura.
You were following me, following Azura, makes sense now.
Because I was hoping that Mercy would read my mind and we would do a double, but it didn't happen.
Sorry, my mind play was to make my sound look more suspicious than everyone else.
I don't trust the rabbit guys, man.
Well, I don't trust the, what are you, a princess?
I'm a rain cloud, man.
This is straight up rain cloud!
What is a different rain cloud called? A cumulative member?
Oh, actually, I didn't mind that task.
That was rather cute. I found that one rather.
No, it's hot.
Okay, it's hot when I'm actually screaming and rage.
Oh, nothing does my, nothing really inverts my nipples.
Like being falsely accused of being impulsive.
I don't trust Rhea, but still.
Like, it literally, oh my god, it doesn't mean so much.
So I was actually going to do, I'm just going to trust that everyone else goes and does that.
Because I think everyone's quite altruistic in the team.
So I'm going to just focus on getting the task done like ASAP so I can get the,
and before we run out of oxygen because of my lack of judgement.
She's pretending! She's pretending to do it!
Is no one doing oxygen or whatever the task is?
I was trying to do oxygen!
How come no one's doing the freakin' challenge, you guys?
Why don't no one do the other one?
What? Are you shitting me?
What? Are you okay?
Reed, are you literate?
What are you doing?
Hello?
Are you okay?
Are you?
Dude.
Legally, being legally blind is a skill issue.
Yeah, sabotage. You're supposed to fix it.
Dude, that was good.
Not as skill as you.
I just assumed everyone else was going to do it and I can't work in to be honest.
Keep yourself safe!
I sabotaged nothing.
I thought you were pretending to do it.
Wait, we don't have our 8th! We don't have our 8th!
Are we all here?
Are we good?
Yeah, we're here now.
We got our 8th.
Oh my god.
Alright, that scared me. Sorry.
All of it here.
I don't want to be a monster anymore.
Bro, please! I want to be a monster!
Dude, I've been a monster like what five times already is crazy.
Tell me about it.
Where do you go?
Oh, Midway.
Okay, Rhea now has a plausible motive because
she corrected her course.
So, perhaps not too sassy for Latuvia.
That worked you.
You were about to vent.
Swear to god.
I have a scan.
I have a scan. Who wants to watch me do a scan?
Watch you do a scan, Rhea.
Yeah, I have.
Who wants to watch me do a scan?
You have to.
Who wants to watch the scan?
I don't want to get the power.
Anyone want to watch a scan?
Only three people.
I'm doing security then.
I don't want to be mercy.
I don't want to be any kind.
I haven't seen Mercy.
I don't know if anyone's got eyes on Mercy.
The serial killer of Viola.
Maybe she died.
I actually don't see her.
I've not seen her.
Okay, there's five of us. It's fine.
There's five of us. It's fine.
I'm scanning.
Is she scanning?
Okay.
Mercy just kills her.
She just kills her.
She just kills her.
Rhea, wait.
Hold on.
Rhea, why did you walk right past that?
Because I was coming out of the scan.
I was coming out of the scan.
No, no, no. Rhea's fine.
I watched your scan.
I watched Mercy kill.
After we all came out of bed.
I was on the scan.
I was on the scan.
I saw Azura coming out of the scan.
I killed Strawny.
She made kills.
Why would you do that?
She just made kills.
Where did you find Rhea?
She was in Med Bake.
I watched her do a scan.
With Strawny.
And then Mercy kills.
It's not Azura. I'm just vouching for her.
I saw Azura walk in that direction.
I'm gonna ask her whatever it's called.
It's the navigation. I think she's fine.
Think...
It's Mercy.
I'm gonna be really upset because I-
Why did you report her body?
You walked right past it Mercy.
I did it.
Mercy you're terrible.
It's Mimosa and Mercy.
I don't know. I think it's you
in the body. I was I was the
one who reported it. I wasn't
there. Yeah. No, Mamosa's fine.
Mamosa's fine. I did it. I
did it. I did it. I did it.
I did it. I ran to Mamosa in
fear. Yeah, you vote for
how does it fatal mating
girly Pop that's why she's
Nothing's is going on. We
don't have to worry about a
Are you sure I mean you were
forgive you because you didn'
your collaboration.
Your collaboration to figure it out is Rhea.
Rhea is a you.
No, but I skinned.
Your pitch raised a little bit when you said that.
If I was lying, my pitch wouldn't change.
And she'd be watching me skin.
Yeah, Rhea is fine.
Rhea is cool.
I mean, Red Bay, um,
I have no idea who the other person is, I'm not skilled enough to know, but I'm glad everyone's enjoying my gameplay.
Yeah, I'm sorry to say I haven't sabotaged.
She's focused, she's locked in.
It's not me, I promise. I'm just sussing you out a little bit.
I don't know.
Hopefully.
Listen, it's one of the joes, it's Mercy Rosa, I bet.
One of the joes.
Mercy, go call and just retake me.
Mita!
It's not me!
It's just one of the joes.
Wait, is it rain?
No, it's not.
Oh my god, no, it's not.
Alright, go on.
Shibi, it's not.
Do it, do it, do it.
It's not me, it's not me.
It's Imi, she's gonna do it.
It's not!
Wait, what if you do it in the other person's report?
Fine, go do it rain, go on.
No, you do it, you do it, it's you.
I can't kill other people's stuff.
Go on then, show what you mean.
I'm gonna check on Azera and Rhea then.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
I've been on fuck.
Just meant to kill someone.
No, look, it's Azera or Rhea.
Look, the three of us will stick together, promise.
Where's Azera?
That's what I'm saying.
Oh, I gotta go back to Midnight, just FYI.
What?
Whispering to yourself, Azera.
Yeah, yeah.
See it?
No way.
Why were you whispering?
You sounded weird.
You said, where did she go?
Where did she go?
That's what I said.
I asked Rhea, where did she go?
Amy, are we killing?
Or did she actually go, it might be like...
No.
No.
Oh, I don't need that.
Hi, Mims.
We're not talking?
We're not talking?
I don't know about that.
I just don't know about that.
I don't know, I don't know.
I haven't checked Electrical in a while.
Maybe somebody died.
Maybe somebody died in Electrical.
Let me check it out.
Honestly, Momosa's pretty smart, though.
If anything, you're probably gonna die in there.
No, dude, can somebody fucking kill somebody damn?
If it's you, Azera.
It's ending.
Probably Mims, I don't know.
I'm just accusing everyone.
It's a double take, but then she realized somebody was nearby.
Hmm.
You could tell somebody this information.
Okay, I'm gonna tell you something.
In case I die.
No.
It might be Momosa, because she did a double take,
but then she saw Rhea was nearby.
Oh, my God.
It's Amy.
It's Amy.
Yes, Amy.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Okay, well, it's not Momosa.
I just have an act for these sort of things.
What can I say?
Because she didn't accuse me even though I was seen on the TV.
Oh, no.
Rain was with me.
Rain was with me.
Yeah, I was with everyone.
Rain over to Rain to tell her that I thought it was Momosa.
It's not.
Because she's dead.
Momosa did a double take, and I thought she's gonna kill me.
Momosa did a double take, and I thought she's gonna kill me.
Momosa did a double take, and I thought she's gonna kill me.
I didn't see her.
I didn't see her killer though.
Listen, if it's not Amy, it's Rhea.
Trust me.
No, it's not Rhea.
I saw her do a body scan.
But she's the one that she might not have killed that round.
Sorry, Amy.
It wasn't Rain.
It wasn't Rain.
She accused me.
Stop killing me.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
Wait a second.
It's not me.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
Listen, I can't believe it's not me.
I can't believe it's not me.
Rhea, we're the only ones we can trust.
We have to figure out
if it's Azura or Rain.
I think it's Rhea.
It's not Rhea.
What does Rain not understand about medbay scan?
What does she not understand?
It's not me.
It's not me.
It's not me.
No, but that was just the first time.
Old people should not be a lot of play among us.
Rhea, we need to
in the shoot room.
We have to be good on this.
We need to think about our steps.
Okay.
What if it's Sheebie?
Because Rhea said that Sheebie never scanned.
So I didn't have a scan.
Sheebie could be...
How are we going to know that?
Sheebie could be
marinating Rhea.
Yes, it's a smelly smell.
Okay, okay.
Rhea, I've been nothing but defend you.
I'm the most.
Each one of you.
It was with Rain.
You were at admin.
Sheebie had like five opportunities to kill me
and she never did.
Unless she's trying to gaslight.
Yes, because if we got rid of one
and my B is gaslighting you
because if Mercy was the imposter
and it's only one
imposter left.
You think me and Mercy are going to be imposter together
three times in a row?
Yeah.
Shroney was literally imposter like four times in a row.
I wouldn't believe it.
Rhea, you have to...
I have to vote as Rhea.
No, it's not me.
Who do you want to vote for?
I will vote for whoever you want to vote for.
It's over.
Alright, love, just vote me off and win.
Is that what you want? I'm not the imposter.
Okay, I'm going to vote for Rhea because
Rain always points to you even when she's not.
Oh, thank god.
Yippee!
Yeah?
I'm sorry, is there if it wasn't you, I apologize.
Yippee!
Yes!
Yes, yes!
Easy, easy.
You did it. I told you.
I'm sorry, is there a...
I should have let you win, damn.
Bouched for you.
Yeah, I had your back.
Don't forget that.
Man, is there a... I'm so sorry.
Where's my story, Rain?
You keep accusing me of doing anything.
Okay.
Listen, once you're out of the game,
I can...
I'm sorry.
I'm back. I'll just stop playing the game.
I was getting nervous because I didn't know how to defend myself.
I was running around the map, which is crazy.
I'm just teasing, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm not sorry.
I'm not sorry because you were so sorry.
Where's your back from pissing?
Yeah, sorry, I...
The piss girl.
The piss.
You'll see all by yourself.
I'll find we've been imposter at least once now.
I'm gonna stop pissing.
Well, at least Azura got to be imposter.
Yeah, one time.
Well, maybe you're imposter again.
Right now.
I need the coconut prattle and that...
Oh!
Mercy DC?
Mercy? Why did Mercy leave?
I don't know. I don't know if we're gonna reset.
Hold on, I'm going in the middle.
Okay.
Hang out with you.
Should I just call a meeting?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, what?
What happened?
Mercy left, so we're just concerned.
Oh, okay.
Is her internet down?
She didn't die. We didn't know what happened with her internet.
Oh, she just got disconnected.
Oh, yeah.
Rain.
Is it rain?
It's not me. It's not, guys.
I know, but it's getting her back in.
Oh, okay.
Alright, it's...
Imposters come forward.
Oh, my God.
Wait, who is it? Rain or Reo?
It was Imi?
Yeah, Imi and Azura.
Imi and Azura?
Oh, I fucking knew Azura got it twice in a row.
Oh, you called it.
I feel bad for her.
The way that she said how she denied it, how she was like,
yeah, imagine.
I was like...
We heard that flick during your voice.
Yup, yup, yup.
Wait for me.
Ready to stand on the side of the table?
Alright, I'll press the button.
I like pressing buttons.
Press the button, girl.
Two more, and then we will...
We will call it.
Yay!
It's not really much of a conclusion other than us all accusing each other
and never talking again.
I know, it's so cute.
Wait, is Azura calling me?
Azura, what do you have to say for yourself?
Is that your mic?
Is that someone's mic or something?
That sounds like popcorn.
I was muted for a second.
Yeah, it sounds like popcorn.
Is that me?
Wait, you guys hear that? No, I hear that.
You guys hear that?
Something's crunchy.
Who's kissing?
Who's frying some chicken?
Is it me?
Someone's frying...
I don't know.
I hear static.
I'm going to turn my voice chat dial down.
I still hear it.
Okay, let me turn my dial down.
Hershey's back!
Yippee!
Yippee!
Definitely not me, it's not me.
Is that a game?
Pretty cool.
Wait, we can only one at a time.
I'm going to mute right now, hold on.
No, you can still hear it.
Okay, it's not me then.
Someone's talking to me, alright.
Someone in the middle, come to the edge if it's not...
If you don't...
I'm going to mute, hang on.
Wait, if you hear it all...
It's gone, it's gone.
I didn't mute.
We're getting a guy...
Who's got a Geiger counter for radiation?
I know, seriously.
Are we ready?
Are we ready?
I'm ready.
I'm in a voucher, I want you to be a voucher.
They're gone?
Okay, thank you.
I believe in other ways.
All your problems might be me.
It's fine.
I would like for Mimosa to be a voucher.
Second last game, baby!
Make it carry.
This is the last game?
Second last game.
And then we call plain because we're the winners.
Gorge?
For a girl's 50th grade.
Sixth?
Sixth, the wiring.
The ones that are like the double ones
where you have to go to a second location
are the ones that like trip you up the most.
Like in terms of like
oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
That's sick.
Two or what is going on in here?
Absolutely nothing.
Sacrifice material.
Oh no, there's an imposter coming my way.
Sure would be a shame if you
absolutely callywacked me for one.
Where the heck is everyone?
This is like the main room.
I don't like this one but I've got a med beta.
Inspect sample.
Lovely.
Whoa!
Hold on, let me put my sample on first.
Let me put my sample on first and then I'll
then I'll do it.
Okay, report.
Hey Mercy!
Self report, self report.
Okay, it's not Shebi or Rea.
Mercy's dead on the med base scanning pad.
Oh.
I wasn't near med bay, I was all around the perimeter.
I saw me doing the leaves.
Rain and I.
And I was on cams.
Who was on cams?
Wait, sorry.
Hold on, hold on.
Who just said scrawny, scrawny, scrawny three times?
Say it one more time for me.
Is it Azura's mic?
Yeah, it's Azura, yeah.
Who said scrawny three times in a row?
Do it again.
I dare you.
Strawny, scrawny, scrawny, scrawny, scrawny,
scrawny, scrawny, scrawny, scrawny.
Self report, self report, self report.
It's a self report!
You are fired!
Let her here!
Let her, let Ramosa talk.
Ramosa, where were you?
It's a self report.
Rain and Rea were together.
Shebi, Rain, Rea were together.
I don't know who to pick.
I don't know if it's scrawny or Ramosa.
I don't know if it's scrawny or Ramosa.
I don't know if it's scrawny or Ramosa.
It's scrawny and Azura.
I will make you sweat later tonight.
We'll talk about it later.
I think it's scrawny and Ramosa.
Oh no!
I will let you sweat later tonight.
I don't have anything to say.
Goodbye.
I'm done, baby.
You didn't hear that too?
Is it me?
No, my turn.
The person who reported the dead body.
Yeah, Ramosa.
Bye.
Open your mouth!
Your coochie smells like trash!
Oh shit!
It's scrawny!
It's not me! She fucking voted me!
So I thought she was sus.
Dude!
It's literally not me. She fucking voted me.
Shebi then. Fuck you.
What the fuck? Why would she so aggrieved?
Wait, no. I'm not being funny.
Everyone's actually ganging up on me.
Because they can't even believe for a second
that I might be a wee bit nice in this game.
Like, so they just instantly get...
Oh, it's a self-report. It's a self-report.
Oh, go get to fuck, man.
Go get to fuck, man.
It's a self-report.
It's a self-report.
I'm sorry. I couldn't...
I just kept hearing...
I just kept hearing Mercy's ghost.
I know, I heard it, too.
it too because I knew if I voted I feel like I would have tied it
you did the same thing to me
listen to people I was about to like say food I was like
it's not about story being nice or not it's about me being dangerous which has
been proven in previous rounds so now none of you you scare me yeah it's true
and every time every time we start you always say that it's probably always
gonna be someone or you say that we're gonna be someone or you say that we're
I don't even know if they're gonna believe that I'm just I'm gonna fuck up the game
they're gonna blame me for everything whenever I'm crewmate I'm just gonna fuck
up the last game and they're gonna have to play low-main games with me and I'm
gonna claim that I am a naughty naughty boy okay this is just my task I did it
up to them to fucking figure out excuse me every round well no it's not I was
actually just with Johnny you're talking to the wall talking to your chat and
it was quite cute so I was just standing at you so wasn't you I was with
mims and
Is that the two of you?
I mean, it's not me, I was trying to find my toss.
Yeah, it's right, I believe.
It's right.
As soon as it's her, as soon as she blames me, I know it's right.
I know it's right.
Dude.
She always blames me and I haven't done anything.
Dude, what the three?
No.
Hold on, hold on.
Her accent.
Yes!
Wait, what's the dealio?
So Mamosa found the body wear.
We found side of reactor.
It was two of them.
Side of reactor.
I was with menzen.
I was with menzen.
Rea and Mamosa.
Rean, sorry.
I was bouncing for menzen.
Wait, I was bouncing for menzen.
I don't know why she's slipping.
I'm not bouncing for rain.
I'm not bouncing for rain because I didn't see.
I don't know.
I was just swiping a card.
Yeah, to be honest.
And I told you guys to go worry about that.
Is it Rean and Mamosa?
Whatever, man.
Was it Pinkerton?
Yeah, it's me.
Vote me.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, it's Rean's being too quiet.
Rean's being too quiet.
Thanks for voting me.
You're welcome.
It was very kind of you to think about me.
The other one is obviously Strani.
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?
Strani killed me.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I think Strani.
Open your mouth.
I'm Strani.
I have to do a bad bay.
I have to do a scan, Strani.
Are you doing scan?
Go watch.
I'm doing fucking 60 seconds.
Countdown, spot the difference.
Oh my God, look at that.
Oh my God.
Oh my God, you're like, you're doing your thing.
Huh?
Well.
Well, it's not us anyway.
Oh yeah, it's not me and Strani.
We're busy there.
What's going on, guys?
You already know my card swipe.
Mama's on my fifth try.
Come on.
No, that's true.
Because before Rea, was it Rea or Shibi was trying to...
Well, it's between Amy and Momosa.
I already did my card swipe.
It's between Amy and Momosa.
Yeah, because me and Strani were hanging out in Med Bay.
I believe Rea's claim on the fifth card swipe.
Momosa, what are you...
Yeah, Rea is...
Momosa, say your piece.
No.
Goodbye.
See you later, ma'ams.
I don't...
I know who it is.
You will rue this day.
I don't...
Oh, I don't know who to vote for.
I'm with Strani.
Okay, yeah.
I was with Strani in Med Bay.
It's Momosa then, because literally Shibi and Shibi have been touching each other all game.
Goodbye.
Yeah, we were touching Rea in Med Bay.
She was doing a full body scan of my delicious bod.
Not Momosa.
What?
Momosa!
Why would you ban them like me then?
Momosa!
Momosa!
Momosa!
Wait, when I was...
Momosa!
Wait, when I was with Momosa, she could have killed me at any time.
And it could have been like...
Well, now we can't hit them.
Well, now we can't hit them.
Rea, because she just stood still and activated the fucking thing.
Aw.
Yes!
You scared me!
Okay.
Wait, what?
I'm so confused.
Wait, can you activate sabotage's whilst on the move?
Can you activate sabotage's while moving?
I don't know.
I honestly don't know.
If you can activate sabotage's while moving.
I feel like...
Can you activate sabotage's while moving?
That sabotage came on while Rea wasn't moving.
Aw, are you serious?
What the fuck?
Wait, wait.
No!
I was only about to hit the button!
Is it aim?
Wait, what?
I'm gonna hide and trigger the button if you want to do the lights.
Please do the lights.
They killed a mother with a baby.
Did somebody leave?
I actually pulled a clutch that's actually crazy.
I'm so proud of her, oh my god.
Wait, what happened?
Wait, what happened to everyone?
You guys don't clear the sabotage.
No one ever clears the sabotage.
Oh, it's the lights!
It's the lights, so if you don't fix it...
Dude, no, not the lights.
The lights doesn't...
Yeah, I said that we won.
It said crew won.
Okay.
Crew won?
Oh, crewmates won?
Yeah.
Oh, I thought we won.
Oh, did you finish out your tasks?
Nice.
Oh, nice, nice, nice.
Are we satisfied?
I don't know, man.
I'm satisfied.
I'm happy.
I'm happy.
I want one more!
I'm not satisfied!
I'm down, man.
One more!
One more!
One more!
One more!
We need a good finish!
One more!
One more!
One more!
I don't know what to expect.
Alright, Rhea, Rhea!
Rhea, clutch that round, because Mim's members...

so I just looked at the bar.
I was so close to...
the other imposter was it was the other imposter it was rain oh it was rain okay she pulled a
stretch she pulled a classic remedy
gonna be honest actually kind of wish i was imposter uh yeah it's a little tip but you know
how to say like one more for luck uh in the behind the scenes are like lord of the rings in the
whenever he like does the scene like it obviously is the director and the actors
you need multiple renditions of the scene to be recorded out um and one and he always goes one
more for luck one more for luck which is him asking the actor to give one more scene even though
oh my god oh my god mercy killed mercy killed rain i saw mercy killed rain mercy killed rain
right in front of me no no it was it was it was azura oh someone got disconnected and that's why
the game ended that's why oh one of the hair and electric so it was not we have an alibi so it was

it's so fucking hard it's hard when they don't give like clear info or that so azura said it was
what wait azura claimed she watched mersey kill her which is obviously never lie so it's so it's
azura azura claimed she saw mersey kill that person well let's kill that man but we now know

into that bush chat we're the heck thank you very thank you so much
okay i got i got both of them unfortunately my game on screen chat freaking died
i don't know why but hey we tried bro that was so fucking fun i don't think any of them expected me
to be like that they so um a bit of a behind the scenes was um the first game we ended up playing
at viola just to like get the girls used to each other was um among us and i was so tame and calm
um oh but i'm fucking good at gas
evil women god you destroyed them i really like listening see what people say um to see if i can
catch them didn't realize i've much of a mastermind i could be yeah baro thank you for the five
me right there ryan colon underscore love love your strongy colon underscore love colon underscore
love colon underscore love um literally that was like so fun and crazy sorry about chat not working
on screen i think i broke it because i just had a membership stream um you cyberbillie the you
you mean the girls so much in the beginning poor i me literally she got freaking wrecked and decked
by me closed the door in her face killed her gen mate and went oh my god what have you done
bro that was awful i feel so bad for doing that but hopefully it was fun and not like
oh my god i hate this um yeah other than the audio issues someone said that a zura for some
reason couldn't hear me even though i'm loud in scots like um me got a awful thought honestly i
me any time it's not any i i me like that uh got hit with a scots rage i don't think you guys
know i was capable of that but i warned you i warned you and and everyone climbing for one more game
means you can be confident that they had a lot of fun good i'm glad that was so fun and it was like
i actually felt a bit nervous like starting up but i feel so comfortable with the yumi plus girls
like they just i don't know all of us seem to be on the same page like we were all in a group
called one hour before figuring it out and like i started doing like a veal or meeting like kind
of recapping on some stuff and i'm like oh you guys couldn't listen in as well like it's just a
few notes so i was like oh everyone's reached 5000 subscribers so we've got an artwork to celebrate
post and all that um it was hilarious yeah i'm ready for uh the after game stress relief honestly
scrawny rage was that rage in that badly i kind of remember i think my rage is basically me going
uh so the other person stops talking so i can say my piece i think that's what my rage is hopefully
it's not too bad uh might have been taking the piss a little bit the whole stream was great yeah
you like that i'm so glad the only you only rage on someone accuses you and you're innocent
oh it annoys me like it was funny don't get me wrong it was so funny but as soon as they go it's
scrawny and i'm like i literally have not done a single thing like i haven't spoken i haven't
claimed anything oh it's scrawny i'm like okay just because the scottish person is like get at the
game like come on i do i have to admit my favorite thing was the double kills um when like there was
four of us but two of them posture going three two one oh it was so satisfying and one oh one
and one of the kills rea was so slow to respond she probably could have reported the body in time
um but she was so slow that she got yoinked um oh honestly on the mention of five came
Paul of scrawny is getting forceful because you aren't eating your tomato
uh scrawny you're too good at the game it's actually i'm aware there's another map um i'm not
really familiar with it at all um and i have spelt modus terribly wrong in the second description
of that um the serotonin from the double kills oh my god it was so sat satisfying especially
with the close proximity just like oh hi and then like i just go three two one and they're both gone
oh and we just like split in different ways oh and that one game i can't me and mary say
didn't even get the round to voting because we had killed so perfectly at different sides of the map
oh he's so good literally can you handle it oh it's so can you handle it
this is so unbelievably good i'm gonna see if there's someone we can read i write it
