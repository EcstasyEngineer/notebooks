00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:31,500
dollar reduced 25 for each cheek well like I was trying to take the photos and

25
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,020
obviously I didn't have any armor on me so it was really hard to take I was like

26
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:47,540
oh my god this is just straight up my my clam is out have any tributes been I

27
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:58,300
learned something new today did you know that ink comes out really fast it can

28
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:04,140
select and deselect things on your phone screen because it happened to two

29
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:12,140
every flings which is not a lot but it's quite common I learned that today

30
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:21,420
yeah let's let it know and so some of yous are on the side of caution and use

31
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:27,100
like wrap over your instruments and then other ones were like fuck yeah I'm

32
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:36,100
there's nothing else okay so we're playing vermin tied to so the reason why we

33
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,060
have to stream snipe this way is because of this certain type of game does not

34
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,860
have like use a code and you can play online thing so I have created a steam

35
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:51,580
account purely for the stream sniping capabilities okay so I'm gonna show my

36
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,780
stream name or code I don't know if the name does if you can't find me because of

37
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,060
the name I'll put in my code and then I'll write down who's played with me and

38
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:07,520
then we'll go next so you wanted ink anything I seem to be really biased for

39
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,660
audios for some reason and and not just because you make audios but like I don't

40
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:19,820
know are you squiddling me Ryan that ain't a cake that's the whole

41
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:30,620
okay thank you the beauty lord 96 real and I like every mommy stream by shooting

42
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:41,820
my ink on the like button stop that's so funny that's how I leave like a smash

43
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:50,780
that like button yes okay so my steam stream snipe account hold on hold on

44
00:05:50,780 --> 00:06:00,220
I'll get there it's called scrawny snipes okay and so I'm just I don't know if I

45
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,540
need to give you my code or if you can search that on steam right now and add

46
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,060
me that way and then I'll write down who our first team is second team is third

47
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:14,900
team and then at the end of stream I'll delete everyone so it's all fairer and

48
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:21,780
I'll see if it works or not I was expecting to be strong is but you think

49
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,780
I put my butt as my profile picture on steam I put beef laying as my profile

50
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:36,860

144
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,980
this is why I wanted to make a steam account because there's so many games

145
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:44,940
that we can play together and that I would like to be next to my reef wings I

149
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:20,100
steam that isn't stream snappable unless you add me which is why I've made this

150
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,140
steam account so we can have a goose on a carry-on or vermin tide and these

151
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,940
kind of steam games together I actually lost a bit of health

152
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:35,500
what are you doing who are you looking at because it's no me it's no me I'm

153
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:46,340
popping this I think 100% orange juice would be a nightmare deep glad rock

154
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,500
galactica you want to play that we can do that literally like cuz we've done

155
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:56,180
this we've unlocked so many games that we can play together for the Empire for

156
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:06,540
this it's the door I might have to play the elf on ironically because she's

157
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:14,460
got oh no I probably annoy me if I keep hearing her we voice we found a door the

158
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,820
southern axe bay garrison but yeah this game is apparently humongous I don't

159
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,060
remember it being this humongous walk but it probably came out this big and I

160
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,820
castle crushers don't play that together I don't know much about castle

161
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:35,900
crushers is it a good party game yeah we can play together

162
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:44,620
are you squiddin me right now just pretend the rodents are non-subscribers

163
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:54,500
trying to get free content what the thank you bleeping reaping senpai you're

164
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:01,660
an amalgamation you said you name your full chest I love it the cannon might be

165
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:10,180
just waiting are you kid in there get past the gate can I run no wait there's

166
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:17,260
no run in this game I mean again that makes sense and unless I'm misunderstood

167
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,380
what just pretend the buddhants are non-subscribers trying to get free

168
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:32,900
content I just broke up you're still forced to subscribe and I'll show up

169
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:37,140
in your your algorithm for a while because whenever you interact with a

170
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,260
new content creator on YouTube their algorithm gets pushed to you so much

171
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,740
like literally if you like and subscribe on a new person once or look up their

172
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,980
name once like if you type strongy cut was on YouTube right now and then

173
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,440
refresh your page it will probably start spamming that 15k celebration ASMR

174
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,540
stream which I still haven't even streamed but I keep recommending it all

175
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:05,220
the time it's got like tons of leaks on it compared to any other like pre done

176
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:15,060
live stream like the stream yeah but you have to like the stream via your ink

177
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:21,140
only you have to aim it right so if this stream has more ow if this stream has

178
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,700
more dislikes than usual I'll know why okay it's true it's been recommended to

179
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:30,340
me for days I know someone sent me a marshmallow and they're like I don't know

180
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,380
what you did to that stream but it keeps getting recommended to me even though

181
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:41,420
it's not like done I'm hydrating I've finished my tea I'm gonna play one

182
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:48,540
hand or not because we're about to get rats unless you guys want to protect

183
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:54,820
me I'm hydrating oh shit oh god the replay please we're so thick of the

184
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:01,540
oh my god but I do fucking later bomb

185
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:12,820
I'm just afraid every winning or losing I don't know

186
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:23,100
okay I think that went really well considering that friendly that's not

187
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,380
friendly

188
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:34,500
oh there's sorcerers in this game okay they seem really weak though what

189
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,780

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:50,120
is it possible to play left or dead two together I think so like as I said there's

234
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:57,080
so many games that being opened up to us now that we can play together and so we

235
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:02,960
can definitely look into what kind of games you guys would like to play because

236
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,200
I don't want to pick all the games like I mean I fucking pick for tonight

299
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:11,200
game talks to me like that and then basically what happens is I come into

be able to survive follow the trail of corpses I have a lever to pull pulling

329
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:50,880
the lever pulling the lever while questing with the reef flings pulling

330
00:39:51,280 --> 00:40:03,320
pulling the lever with my weak little wrists look as go wrong lever I wish I

331
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:11,280
had Washington I guess it's another adjourn stream look I'm sure I can get

332
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:17,720
one green attribute because that reef I'm freaking stole them all asking I'm

333
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:23,320
on to you there we go down there

334
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:34,480
oh guess he gets the ball okay I don't know what I'm doing I'm just I'm just

335
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,320
slicing I'm spawn killing I'm literally spawn killing right now there's

336
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,000
nothing they can do about it I'm just so MLG for right I'm definitely to go

337
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,280
downstairs

338
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:54,960
wow get that rat okay I just fall on the reef land and I'm swiping oh okay I'm

339
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,480
definitely not a gun specialist I didn't even know they had weaponry like

340
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:11,760
that I thought it was merely only I think I did it I'm helping I'm helping

341
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:20,280
oh wait wait push the suspicious bricks is there something we're supposed to do

342
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,720
or are we just going in circles until we can figure out what happens I'll just

343
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,480
let the reflings guide me you get off your pop guys you do your thing you do

344
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,440
I'm just having a good time oh it's bug me how inaccurate games portray the

345
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:42,160
great sword move it's so damn clunky okay I'm gonna just follow this reef one

346
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:49,840
I don't know what I'm doing he's pushing the buttons on the wall

347
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:59,680
take this take this take this hmm I wonder if Warhammer have any more games

348
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,840
like this speaking of following the trail of corpses I was in a DND campaign

349
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:11,360
once where we infiltrated at Colton the sewers but got captured so a powerful

350
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:16,840
NPC bartender came to save us saying he just follow the trail of bodies to find

351
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:25,240
us oh you play D&D you little nerd thank you tiny spiny yeah Aristo was telling

352
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:30,400
me about D&D games and she told me like one of our sessions got cancelled and

353
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,720
all that and I'm like I'm gonna pretend I know what any of this means okay I think

354
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,200
the reflings are working together I don't know I'm just following this one

355
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:45,340
I'm following I'm following I'm following look I have a leash on me the

356
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:56,300
reflings are gating me strongy you would love D&D nerd the audacity no nerd

357
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:00,900
isn't a nice way is nerd still an insult these days I feel like nerd is a

358
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:09,240
compliment to people like us like we love being there I want to get into D&D but

359
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,400
don't have friends okay we're just gonna have to do a D&D together that's the

360
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:19,880
only option okay there's plenty of these so I'm gonna be cheeky and he'll like

361
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:25,480
two XP I said what I said nerd is not a badge of honor yeah I feel like nerd

362
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,080
means like oh you're you're like me and like we can play games together making

363
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:35,760
hang out and meme and stuff whereas like if you're not a nerd it's like how on

364
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,000
earth am I supposed to explain to you which give it a toilet like why it's so

365
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,840
funny to a brain roll sometimes an insult usually it's honorific it depends

366
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:53,040
on the context yeah if I called you a nerd would you find it an insult it's not an

367
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,520
insult when you say it okay okay it's all about the tone in the tent

368
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:04,480
here's my little noon who knows all about warhammer lore is you darling sorry

369
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,400
there's a refling under attack and I hate when they get under attack cuz I don't

370
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:13,280
want them I'm just here for you to oh you're not refling go away I wear these

371
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:20,800
fun and everywhere okay I think I'm okay there's a lot of blood on my screen I

372
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:29,800
think maybe next game I'll put it on normal difficulty I mean super hard

373
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:35,120
difficult I wonder which kind of refling strong he likes to eat more the strong

374
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:41,360
and confident settler parts for the blushing nerdy guys I don't think I

375
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:48,880
really mean cuz either way either way it's like I can I can mold you into what

376
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,240
I want I can hypnotize you to be what I want you know in the moment because it's

377
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,240
not like I'm not just like I 100% want this this thing always and there's no

378
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:06,760
variation whatsoever like no I like the variation who is whispering in my

379
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,800
name thank you anonymous for the tip no I think it's good like I like the

380
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:18,360
variety so it's like even if you're like well I'm actually 100% don't there's no

381
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:26,600
way that strongy would change that nice try mate nice try you're funny you're

I'll ink myself stop it you're turning me off I'm just following this I can't

392
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:53,880

393
00:46:53,880 --> 00:47:01,520
know I don't know I'm swinging I'm swinging though oh I'm absolutely

394
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,720
swinging my heart out I don't even know if we're supposed to go this way but I'm

395
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:12,120
doing it anyway he looks like the the guy that's gonna decapitate you in

396
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:26,240
Shrek that's all you got go on oh good I I think I'm going the right way I'm not

397
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:39,240
sure not again not yet I think I think we're accidentally far away from the

398
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,960
oh god they're fighting as well okay okay hopefully I don't mess up hopefully

399
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:51,040
don't mess up but we're doing our best that's the main thing even though the

400
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,400
game is coded to have okay they're coming I think we're okay but I'm

401
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,040
defending it they're getting secrets and stuff but we're doing the main quest

402
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:07,360
okay okay behind the altar is a book behind the altar is a book there is

403
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:15,400
yank I've taken it I have the book I'm the bookkeeper see who said whole bags

404
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:22,400
can't be a librarian oh my god sexy librarian did it oh I never said I

405
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,680
never leaked that I originally wanted a schmaksy librarian but and that got

406
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:33,280
changed in development I couldn't make it work I couldn't make it work I had to

407
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:40,880
be a librarian paired with some sort of Neko and it's not Neko Mimi Kim Kimono

408
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:51,360
Mimi the animal words animal use I'm just swinging swinging all day long yeah

409
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:58,600
I was submitting for it but wasn't happening oh I like whatever that

410
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:07,080
ultimate is Kimono Mimi yes if we did librarian it would have to be paired

411
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:15,960
with something like that but obviously she be was formed and it's just a bit

412
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:30,800
too close to the cons just wrap the ritual what's that just wrap the ritual

413
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:42,840
what we supposed to do we're to go inside stay inside the circle okay we're

414
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:47,720
not gonna leave man I hate this ritual I'm just I'm so disruptive of this

415
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:54,160
ritual was stinky ritual yeah that's what I think about this ritual I will girl

416
00:49:54,160 --> 00:50:05,560
sexy librarian oh honestly that's not bad I will do you okay don't let it hook

417
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:15,280

clicking right now that's how good at this game I am what do you mean all I'm

419
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:26,600
doing is swinging and not aiming whoa I did it I actually killed something with

498
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:30,080

499
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:42,080
yes of course reeflings oh so stoic so strong chair sit oh my god it's so quick I kneel my reef I

500
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:50,080

501
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:57,760
against the wall oh I'm going to be sick oh I'm motion sick okay I kiss this replaying

502
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:03,120
and then I kiss this replaying and then I kiss this replaying if the reefling wants to kiss I

503
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:10,880
don't think so already we're all ready for battle into the main this level is very dark okay

504
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:19,200
now I may have put my gamma off a little bit okay that's because I'm blind we didn't get any kisses

505
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:25,680
you don't get I give you kisses when the stream started I went oh shite so

506
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:33,680
okay that that almost went terribly wrong I almost died to fall damage I'm not even pretending

507
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:40,400
to throw any chunders honestly chanda

508
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,680
I wonder how well the skeleton MCC's do

509
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:53,760
I think there is only five playable characters so you will see

510
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,640
um a lot of characters that you like you'll see the same ones

511
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:06,480
but I don't know if there's DLC characters or if they rounded if they polish the game off

512
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:18,480
a rather well and did it that way a blight stormer oh my god did you know I'm part Irish by the way

513
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:27,520
that's a terrible joke don't laugh at that uh don't laugh at that where are we going I'm following

514
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,760
five characters but 20 classes strong enough

515
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,480
is it a bottom I don't know

516
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,440
I'm doing it I'm doing it I'm winning

517
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:54,560
I totally know exactly what we're doing but yes we're exploring we're trying to find the black

518
01:02:54,560 --> 01:03:01,520
powder cache so it makes me think the next mission is blowing something up to smithereens and beyond

519
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:09,680
I'm not sure what other games we could if you guys went left or did to 100 we'll do it I'm not

520
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:18,720
familiar with it did you see that block though oh my god did you see that block

521
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:24,880
oh my god sorry that was the most perfect block I will never do that for the rest

522
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,560
of the gameplay please admire it but that's your heart's content because I will not do

523
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:37,680
I will not be recreating that I'll take it I'm killing I'm killing

524
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:50,160
I am I'm see the temporary HP I'm getting though I'm really happy with that that's going to keep

525
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:56,240
me alive longer maybe maybe medium difficulty not so scary okay maybe it's not so scary

526
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:05,040
left or dead is the only cop game I can afford but there are three more free games like I know

527
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:09,920
people like the dog on vtuber's for playing apex and all that but it's like it's free anyone come

528
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:18,800
play it you don't have to you just have to you know give up your personal data oh oh oh no I can't

529
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:27,280
go insane oh my god refling you can't fit can you that's such a shame you're just gonna have to

530
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:38,480
ram it terrible that's not terrible 10th HP is a game changer I'm done for some left or dead to

531
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:45,520
only under what mods are amaz I've never even played the vanilla at least let me play vanilla

532
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:52,880

537
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:42,240
ignite us all and send us into orbit vanilla left for dead is amazing the atmosphere is great

538
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,640

541
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:07,360
to protect you but I'm rubbish and very slow to respond to anything that occurs in this game

542
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,080
I've got two extra barrels

543
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:18,320

552
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:21,840
I'm the only one that seems to be dying in this game that takes hp damage even though I'm swinging

553
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:26,640
all the time it's that picture of strony with x-tona and now hold on a minute

554
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:34,400
warhammer used to be cultured but then they stopped letting the dark elves have their bities out

557
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:53,280

558
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,400

01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:57,760
not only am I a gamer princess I'm also a passenger princess in games if only I could jump on it but

569
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:36,880
I was like the idea of hypnotizing you and then just absolutely fucking destroying you

570
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:47,040
I need to make that audio I just really like the idea of it like I'll make it so it seems

571
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,720
oh my god I can't actually see

572
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:55,120
uh I cannot see I'm legally blind

573
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:03,040
I I'm just taking the L on this one holy holy moly I

574
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:10,960
I'm losing it I'm actually losing it I'm swinging in the dark I can't see nothing

575
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,600
if you can't see nothing at home folks please don't work because I can't see none either

576
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:21,280
I then again what on earth I'm supposed to do right now I'm gonna just stay I'm gonna heal up

577
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:28,160
and then I'm gonna grab this because it looks like the reef ones are fine some of the selfish

578
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:35,440
and take the healing I literally am I supposed to be able to say

579
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:41,520
where did I miss what audio she's talking about no I'm talking about making one I knew audio

580
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,600
don't tempt me with a good thing they did not get this home

581
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:54,240
at least the scary boys are giving us some light I mean oh I can see

582
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,000
strongly with the ink would come out so fast it'd bring me like a button

583
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:07,120
it would I was thinking like if I did the audio I would premise it like oh I'm gonna be like a pillow

584
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:13,040
princess and it's like surprise I'm gonna be fucking feral on you

587
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:38,880
the piddle size from your little piddle of ink I think I maybe make it a bit more obvious okay I

588
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:44,080
can see again so that's the good news um actually speaking of seeing I'm putting my glasses on

589
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:52,480
sorry my cute little glasses that are for literal children because my head is so small for some

590
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:58,400
reason I have an abnormally small fucking head I just have a quick rundown on the lore I've never

591
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:05,200
had glasses um and then when I went to get them I got sized um and I was like pick oh sorry I just

592
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:09,760
punched the mic I was picking out what glasses I wanted and I had to pick from the child section

593
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:16,320
because my head is like small I don't know why I think it may explain why I'm dumb because my head

594
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:22,000
is like small and considered a child size head which makes no sense because I have a big forehead

595
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:30,560
well it doesn't make any sense easier to head pat or like fucking head smack like bonk

596

618
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:23,920
is going on with me I'm getting a bit a bit fucking tired of it but being honest like no

619
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:28,800
it's nothing to do with you like you've not done anything wrong if anything like I'm super happy

620
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:38,800
because like I get to be a tease um like I was nervous posting the picture and oh my god right

621
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:45,360
if you've seen the picture please open up my alt twitter right now and look at the picture I brought

622
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:53,040
the two like backwards and I was like I literally cannot do anything better than like what I've done

623
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:59,200
and I just had to accept that like it just looked awful I just I was like no I can't do any better

624
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:08,480
than that so it didn't work and then I used the coconut oil for a photo it looks like yo no I did

625
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:16,320
no I'm not a pirate I didn't write you on my butt no I just thought there's a number two in the

626
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:24,720
picture you can't see it I drew 20 on my cheek and one is on my drew pink and then on the other

627
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:35,360
I drew green because of my hypnosis colors but it was so hard what I don't have a bomb

628
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:42,720
um I'm helping I'm helping beat them up beat them up make them regret being born

629
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,480
oh my god I'm knocking them over oh

630
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:56,640
is that all you got those were numbers yeah at least the zero was impossible to get back

631
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:05,040
well like you know the worst thing was I practiced before I wrote it like I did it

632
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:13,120
in like my finger in the air um I did it with my finger in the air and uh yeah I messed up

633
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,800
so that's even worse I laughed a lot when I saw the backwards too but then I got a bit distracted

634
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:24,240
we need to work on mommy's like abilities to do well I didn't uh so I couldn't sit on anything so it

635
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:29,120
wasn't like I could sit on the floor it was in like one leg behind my head type thing a bit

636
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:39,440
oh we just nuked that place I deserved um you practice writing numbers well to write it on

637
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:43,840
myself I like did it the right way but then it came out the wrong way and I don't know how I did it

638
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:51,920
and I just I had been um like I wasn't feeling very well but I did want to do it so I was just

639
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:58,400
like right that's it oh we're done oh my god we're gonna complete act one

640
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:08,080

642
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:22,160

751
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:58,000
I'm coming are we feeling

752
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:05,560
I didn't even know that was a thing okay is that bear or the health bar where

753
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:15,560
this yeah no I did it you're what I'm coming me at the end of the street

754
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:21,240
yeah I want to play lots of games with you today and then after I finish playing

755
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:27,520
yeah I'm gonna do something I'm gonna post the meme I'll make the meme and then

756
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:33,520
I'll post an audio and then I'll take it a bit easier unfortunately me fucking

757
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:39,080
stress levels are back I'm so annoyed I was feeling so de-stressed and it's all

758
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:42,360
kind of come back again

759
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:56,160
but it's just one of them things like a cycle honestly I'm doing fine though but

760
01:32:56,160 --> 01:33:00,680
it's like one of those frustrating things because I'm quite like logical with

761
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:06,000
well I'm not I'm one of my wounds so my graphics so I stop that's not funny you

762
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:13,360
can't say stuff like that and so that completely lost my train of thought

763
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:18,640
cuz I said that out loud and what I meant to say is like when I have a bomb I

764
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:21,680
know what's up I know what the reason is I know what the purpose of it is I know

765
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:24,880
why it's been caused I don't know I don't know why it's happening right now

766
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:28,360
and it's making me very sick to the point where I can't eat normally at the

767
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:32,120
moment which is really annoying like I'll take a few bites and then and then I

768
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:37,520
get dumped with adrenaline and I'm like do you mind does that stop I mean

769
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:41,880
honestly yes I'm not even gonna argue yes the puppy needs stress relief I'm

770
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:48,560
not even arguing for one like that is a that's why we're gonna be a cheeky

771
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:57,160
audio but thank you for the legend kind of real answer why you stressed I don't

772
01:33:57,160 --> 01:34:04,040
know I can't figure out I'm gonna take some medicine I don't want to be a

773
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:08,440
weirdo I don't want to like make anyone feel weird but if you guys are

774
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:14,800
comfortable I'll take some medicine and I'll go get something in my tummy and

775
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:28,000
then we'll keep playing that's okay let's do it let's get to get right get

776
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,760
right get right get shredded get shredded get shredded what's that what's

777
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:39,760
that food that you shred beef no it's not beef jerky brisket I'm shredding them

778
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:44,200
like brisket or something no peeled pork column pork cuz I'm shredding them

779
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:52,360
you know I'm trying I'm trying so do we need to do yeah it's just a medicine I

780
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:56,560
don't I've never streamed well on the medication that's the only problem

781
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:02,760
because it's diazepam which puts your brain to sleep so you stop overthinking

782
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:08,120
and freaking out basically and I don't know if it's gonna inherit my ability to

783
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:21,480
stream you can find out live here folks yeah I think I'm probably gonna have a

784
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:25,680
manager come in a bit quicker than I originally anticipated I'm gonna see if

785
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:32,360
I can streamline it to next month because I'm needing to like just step away

786
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:36,320
from having any responsibilities other girls sorry I thought you're an enemy

787
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,360
because of the whisper in my ear

788
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:59,000
and you don't come in to get Benzo what's Benzo like bozo what's Benzo no filter

789
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:09,080
nice to take some responsibility yeah like I'm needing to just completely step

790
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:17,480
away from anything basically cuz it's I don't know why see the thing is my

791
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:22,520
responsibilities have less and I have less to do but I've never felt more

792
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:28,200
worse and you know and before anyone's like oh maybe take some days off of

793
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:34,200
streaming my relief is like I don't have to think of anything right now I'm

794
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:38,880
playing with my refunds we're goofing off killing rats in the game and we're

795
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:44,400
just getting to the next location I'm swinging my sword we're playing on easy

796
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:52,200
mode because I'm actually too underleveled I can't do a thing the

797
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:56,920
responsibilities now have a lot of your control yes that was actually an

798
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:01,680
interesting talking point if anyone's kind of curious about like the behind-the-scenes

799
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:13,240
stuff and the whoa and we have a bomb bomb coming in

800
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:22,560
and it's giving up control to other people when it's like I wouldn't do it

801
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:26,360
that way that was a big thing that comes into it like I have to give up that I

802
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:30,400
can't do everything myself and I'll have to rely on other people and if they

803
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:34,440
don't give me stuff on time well who does it affect does it affect my growth

804
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:39,040
no because I deal with my own stuff but does it affect their the girls growth

805
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:44,640
and it's like yes like and we had like shorts people like people who edit

806
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:49,520
shorts applied to the website they came on board and they're like I can't give

807
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:54,280
you a short until two weeks away and it was like I'm not being funny but can you

808
01:37:54,600 --> 01:38:00,000
like the gift no no if you're a shorts editor I promise you I really do

809
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,600
appreciate you what you do for the girls and all that but like I can't give you

810
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:09,640
anything for two weeks and it's like why did you apply right now then why

811
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:13,880
didn't you apply in two weeks when you're available there's a refund down now

812
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:20,920
I just got twad I'm getting twad I don't know why sorry was a horde

813
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:25,440
nothing will get in the way like literally unless I have food poisoning or

814
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:31,360
I'm literally in the hospital sorry but you're even if I get food poisoning I'm

815
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:36,760
gonna boot up for five minutes have a giggle and then go off like I need to be

816
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:44,680
in the hospital and or and then that'll break my streak it's tough taking your

817
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:49,200
hands off the wheel yeah definitely like it means kind of spoken about how it's

818
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:52,800
hard because she's like a bit of a perfectionist and I can really appreciate

819
01:38:52,800 --> 01:39:00,760
that the point of view because it is a bit like oh we need to heal Lenny you

820
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:07,800
should heal oh you did heal everyone's healed I'm gonna heal my missing three

821
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:17,040
HP don't mind if I do I applied right now because most of these things are

822
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:22,800
limit times Johnny not limits just join us next week or never yes so we're

823
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:27,400
trialling the clipping program to see if it's like gonna be worth it I mean

824
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:33,720
fucking I'm so happy for me and if you didn't know me had a short that fell

825
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:41,480
into the algorithm program and oh my god I'm so happy like I'm so freaking happy

826
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:47,480
first that like 30,000 subscribers which is insane I'm just I couldn't be over

827
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:52,480
the moon and I couldn't be over the moon what I couldn't be happier for her I'm

828
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:56,960
over the moon for her and like the girls have got new shorts back coming out

829
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:08,160
like after the stream once I've finished in can see you I'm gonna upload like

830
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:12,600
more shorts and basically just hope one of them falls into the algorithm for

831
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:18,000
each of the girls that's all we can do really it's all you know the management

832
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,160
can do is make sure it's like we pay for the shorts they just tell us what they

833
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:28,080
want to be made not everything is what on earth am I supposed to do I'm I'm just

834
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:33,200
shooting okay I don't know if I'm supposed to avoid the fart cloud why

835
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:44,200
did you do that yeah is that 215 KVS like literally if that happened if one

836
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:48,240
short popped off for each of the girls that's all I could ask for like I'm so

837
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:52,560
happy that we as management get to pay for it and it doesn't come out of their

838
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:58,040
income it doesn't come out of you know it's not like we reserve like more than

839
01:40:58,040 --> 01:41:03,440
20% like it's not 20% goes into the agency the agency pay for their shorts

840
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:11,280
with it all that jazz all that goodness and I can't tell who he's looking at

841
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:17,880
replay no oh why do I keep drinking every time I want to help a replaying

842
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:24,920
why did I just give up and start drinking oh I'm out of ammo I don't know

843
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:32,960
what Luke that is but I got it I love how you girls

844
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:37,240
Johnny has a drinking problem straight to the I'm like refland's gone what's the

845
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:43,000
point gives up and starts to be flown about to die cheers I'll drink to that

846
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:48,200
no it's cuz I'm so distraught are you drinking to cope with the stretch of it

847
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:54,120
with the stress of watching the refland suffer I think so mommy can't stop

848
01:41:54,120 --> 01:42:00,920
drinking to escape our problem exactly I'm out of ammo I don't know if that's

849
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:05,400
gonna be a problem hopefully nothing grabs me or a refland that needs to be

850
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:14,320
shot from afar we fling panic response vomit a strong ease but drinking oh we

858
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:06,800

885
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:56,760
good for accessible stream sniping wise yes I thoroughly enjoy it I don't think

886
01:45:56,760 --> 01:46:00,040
we're gonna finish the campaign I really wouldn't mind booting up this game

887
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:07,360
again for stream sniping reasons okay what would our team be called DCR

888
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:22,560
RCD R CDR DCR disser disher okay our team name is this her with an

889
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:28,080
exclamation mark no with three exclamation marks okay this team name is

890
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:36,000
disher spelled d-i-s-s-h-e-r with uh capitals all over disher I hardly even know her

891
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:47,280
exactly yes I literally write that as you type that okay we are official in these DLC downloadable

892
01:46:47,360 --> 01:47:00,720
content kill yourself in mancraft act one of no act two I sell yin lui the bridge of

893
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:06,440
shadows has been a boon but it seems our enemies have gotten wise oh lesia says

894
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:11,720
there's interference in the winds of magic centered around an old elf temple

895
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:16,840
nearby take a wander have a gander and put a stop to whatever they're up to with

896
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:20,920
a lot of work to do and we won't stand a chance if we're left marching up and

897
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:26,720
down the countryside right okay I can't do any I can't increase the difficulty so

898
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:31,240
no one complain about playing on easy mode thank you

899
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:39,360
sorry if this appears like a question but I was curious about when someone who

900
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:43,720
applied to the clip of program might expect a responsive accepted I think is

901
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:50,800
getting processed either today or tomorrow by management if you don't hear

902
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:56,800
anything please don't take it personally I am trying to min max exposure for the

903
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:01,920
girls and obviously I think it's fair to say the clipping program is rather

904
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:08,560
generous and so there's a lot of like we need to obviously we get 20% from the

905
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:17,040
girls and but we need to min max a we need min max a fucking feature for

906
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:20,800
agency simulator game in real life though and so if you don't hear anything

907
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:24,560
back please don't be insulted that that doesn't mean we hate you or anything like

908
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:30,520
that it just means we are trying to find like the best possible thing and I

909
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:36,940
believe we're also going to display those who are a part of the program on

910
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:44,140
the website just to kind of be like you also kind of the girls may oh my god

935
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:36,980
on YouTube I can't believe it I'm gonna force you guys to watch the scheme with

936
01:51:36,980 --> 01:51:44,660
me okay so here's a bit Scotland lore and there was a TV show that filmed the

937
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:50,140
real lives of people that lived in a scheme scheme is a location where the

938
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:55,380
government pay for your housing because you know poverty and strife and you know

939
01:51:55,380 --> 01:52:00,380
not got job etc blah blah blah blah but the problem was this was real people's

940
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:07,820
lives that they were broadcasting and it got cancelled in terms of they couldn't

941
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:14,060
continue film production because it was like wildly inappropriate now we have

942
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:20,060
shows called like Jeremy Kale or we had it the equivalent is like Jerry Springer

943
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:29,300
but Jerry Springer is people's lives like enhanced or you know standing actors

944
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:34,820
that kind of thing no this this stuff is real people's lives they're fighting

945
01:52:34,820 --> 01:52:40,180
drug addiction they're fighting poverty they're fighting like all these

946
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:48,900
attributes I have the art art art art and all that kind of thing and basically

947
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:54,180
the scheme got was about Scotland I'm gonna make you watch it I'm forcing you

948
01:52:54,180 --> 01:52:59,340
to watch it to be like just so you can see about what what Scotland is actually

949
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:06,460
like because a lot of people picture Edinburgh and like oh it's Harry Potter

950
01:53:06,460 --> 01:53:13,060
s because it's like all tiny buildings there's like we have a nation that's

951
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:20,060
addicted to methamphetamines we have heroin problems in Scotland

952
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:30,420

Need percentages. I need fractions. Is it three fourths? Is it one half? Is it one thirds?

1259
02:30:04,120 --> 02:30:08,280
Where these medkits do why wouldn't you let mommy touch you exactly?

1260
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:11,120

1261
02:30:12,360 --> 02:30:14,360

02:30:15,880 --> 02:30:20,040
On higher difficulty here's are so rare get into the habit of not using them

02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:48,200
He looks like Kratos

1269
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:51,480

02:31:21,440 --> 02:31:23,440
My god, you fell off the map

1277
02:31:24,440 --> 02:31:26,440
Oh

1278
02:31:29,400 --> 02:31:34,360
I'm swinging and swinging. Okay, we take no gravity deaths today

1279
02:31:35,800 --> 02:31:37,800
Destroy the belt. Oh

1280
02:31:38,760 --> 02:31:40,760
The hordes are infinite

1281
02:31:41,680 --> 02:31:48,480
So when I started the game the tutorial thing was like there's never peace

1282
02:31:49,160 --> 02:31:52,440
So are we just fighting to stay alive really?

1283
02:31:53,440 --> 02:31:55,440
Over anything

1284
02:32:05,760 --> 02:32:09,320
That was really easy, I'm quite glad with that one. I have a bomb, too

1285
02:32:13,360 --> 02:32:15,920
Even need me I guess I do

1286
02:32:17,880 --> 02:32:22,880
The world is like mid-apocalypse so it never gets better trying to stop rat armageddon

1287
02:32:23,560 --> 02:32:25,560
What unique story

1288
02:32:26,760 --> 02:32:28,760
Ratmageddon

1289
02:32:28,760 --> 02:32:33,080
You will not succeed. So is it helpful like we never make it better

1290
02:32:37,400 --> 02:32:39,400
I'm cleavering

1291
02:32:39,920 --> 02:32:41,920
I'm cleavering

1292
02:32:42,040 --> 02:32:46,280
Got a side swipe all three of them. Oh, that's friendly. Sorry

1293
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:49,280
I

1294
02:32:49,680 --> 02:32:52,240
Maybe need to put like an outline marker on you guys

1295
02:32:57,400 --> 02:33:00,800
Warhammer universe is actually a really dark place. Oh, that's such a shame

1296
02:33:04,240 --> 02:33:08,840
There is no happy ending at all. Oh, no, that's such a shame

1297
02:33:09,080 --> 02:33:10,400
I

1298
02:33:10,400 --> 02:33:16,060
Was like when like we defeat the evil and we get to live happily ever after that thing

1299
02:33:17,400 --> 02:33:23,480
Her warhammer fans wait, so when like a new installment or storyline or whatever comes out in Warhammer

1300
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:29,320
Does everyone just unanimously accept it's gonna be like the most depressing literature they've ever read

1301
02:33:39,480 --> 02:33:42,120
Yes, it's always about I mean technically the gods

1302
02:33:42,840 --> 02:33:47,880
Decided forget this and then they went and made new iterations of the world, which is worth in the current

1303
02:33:48,720 --> 02:33:53,080
Orcs disagree universe plundered into chaos and ended battles their idea

1304
02:33:55,280 --> 02:34:03,120
Basically, yeah, but occasional moments of badass or something. Oh, that's GGs. That's such a shame. That's the lore

1305
02:34:04,120 --> 02:34:07,840
Like you just agree

1306
02:34:10,360 --> 02:34:17,280
In warhammer 40k suffering is your happiness and death is your only solace wait, so is death scene like

1307
02:34:18,320 --> 02:34:23,840
Is it very like oh you're very honored if you like got a lot of kills before you died type thing

1308
02:34:25,560 --> 02:34:29,400
It's called grim dark for a reason honestly though

1309
02:34:30,400 --> 02:34:32,400
Thank you stash power

1310
02:34:33,400 --> 02:34:37,960
See I'm getting educated about warhammer because he's a thing like oh you know warhammer whatever

1311
02:34:38,480 --> 02:34:44,000
But like if you make it sound oh, I actually did something I killed the most elite

1312
02:34:44,520 --> 02:34:46,520
Agro melee kills

1313
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:50,240
Yes, I use a melee weapon and most revised

1314
02:34:51,440 --> 02:34:52,880
Oh, yeah

1315
02:34:52,880 --> 02:34:54,720
I'm so good

1316
02:34:54,760 --> 02:35:01,520
Thank you again stash power for that too much us the deeds will be called the emperor's finest as a quote

1317
02:35:03,960 --> 02:35:10,960
And warhammer 40k humans have to sacrifice themselves by millions a day for the survival of the race is that dark

1318
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:17,880
Are pregnant people even a thing everything the deed not deep oh

1319
02:35:18,320 --> 02:35:27,000
The dead will be called the emperor's finest because they gave their lives for the empire

1320
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:36,600
Grim dark no happiness or shining light there's only one small step forward and 20 back because of that one small step

1321
02:35:39,440 --> 02:35:45,440
No one mentioned dread not sir mungus death isn't even great because you automatically get sent to heck

1322
02:35:46,440 --> 02:35:47,960
Why?

1323
02:35:47,960 --> 02:35:53,400
That's so bizarre. Thank you Evelyn. Thank you. Thank you. I am gonna go

1324
02:35:54,200 --> 02:35:55,880

Then

1328

We'll get the next group in and we'll do the next mission

1329

02:36:15,560 --> 02:36:22,160
Did you guys see that bird tick tock where the bird goes coca-cola and maybe money thing in war hammer

1332
02:36:22,160 --> 02:36:25,480
The best and you can hope for is one on your own terms

1333
02:36:26,200 --> 02:36:32,320
Also, most story lines end in blazes of glory or depending on what writer is on deck

1334
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:39,040
Fucking stupid shine killing a whole bunch of nuns for fighting demons too. Well. Oh

1335
02:36:39,400 --> 02:36:41,400
Thank you, Chris

1336
02:36:42,840 --> 02:36:46,680
For the tip it's really funny hearing Brian say Scottish slang

1337
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:53,280
What did you say really fucking stupid shy? Hold on. I'm getting Brian to say that again. That was really funny

1338
02:36:56,920 --> 02:37:01,400
In war hammer the best and you can hope for is one on your own terms

1339
02:37:02,120 --> 02:37:08,200
Also, most story lines end in blazes of glory or depending on what writer is on deck

1340
02:37:08,360 --> 02:37:10,360
Really fucking stupid

1341
02:37:16,400 --> 02:37:23,640
No good guys because even the art really good guy emperor meet like million souls a day to stay static

1342
02:37:25,240 --> 02:37:29,480
Whoa, I didn't realize how dark war hammer was

1343
02:37:32,080 --> 02:37:34,080
That's crazy

1344
02:37:34,200 --> 02:37:37,760
Enjoy the rest of the game and stream and proof when he says it rest well sleep well

1345
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:43,080
And right I'm gonna quickly grab some food and then we'll bring in the next batch of hooligans

1346
02:37:44,480 --> 02:37:50,440
And and we'll have more streamstaping shenanigans. I didn't say we might actually be

1347
02:37:50,760 --> 02:37:54,600
Hold on. I'm just gonna check out the missions really quick to see what we're looking at

1348
02:37:55,560 --> 02:38:00,400
But I think we could definitely finish we may be able to finish up the first map

1349
02:38:01,080 --> 02:38:03,080
and

1350
02:38:03,680 --> 02:38:08,240
There's four maps, okay, so what we're already halfway

1351
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:14,160
So it take me what four hours to get to here. Maybe five hours not a big deal

1352
02:38:14,880 --> 02:38:17,880
So then the next time we stream snipe it would be

1353
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:22,800
There's only four levels

1354
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:29,240
Wait we can finish the whole multiplayer theory

1355
02:38:29,240 --> 02:38:31,240
And

1356
02:38:31,480 --> 02:38:37,800
Not to yeah, okay, I think we're playing the whole damn game man, okay curious

1357
02:38:40,880 --> 02:38:45,400
Yeah, there is a race that has to do the most sadistic stuff to people

1358
02:38:45,400 --> 02:38:48,200
Like making people on the front you're keeping them conscious

1359
02:38:49,240 --> 02:38:51,240
Chaos God is a music

1360
02:38:53,080 --> 02:38:57,320
Burn the witch purge the heritage suffer not the Xeno to live

1361
02:38:57,680 --> 02:38:59,680
Yeah

1362
02:39:00,240 --> 02:39:02,240
Thank you so much very large

1363
02:39:03,080 --> 02:39:05,680
I'm guessing that's a quote from some other game

1364
02:39:10,280 --> 02:39:18,280
Everyone in all has iterations of Warhammer's fantasy 40k age of Sigmar isn't a but hold on

1365
02:39:19,320 --> 02:39:21,320
What do we burn apart from witches?

1366
02:39:22,680 --> 02:39:25,000
Wait, aren't we the Xeno? I don't know

1367
02:39:25,400 --> 02:39:26,520
Oh

1368
02:39:26,520 --> 02:39:32,320
Can do all map one now and then the two three four next time. I'll see how it goes. Okay, right. I'm gonna

1369
02:39:33,160 --> 02:39:36,160
Take a Pog's champus and I'm gonna go for a tinkle

1370
02:39:36,160 --> 02:39:39,960
I'm gonna heat up leftovers and we'll get some food and then we'll bring the next team in, okay?

1371
02:39:40,680 --> 02:39:42,680
and

1372
02:39:42,680 --> 02:39:44,680
But yeah, oh Xeno's are alien

1373
02:39:45,400 --> 02:39:47,640
There's aliens in this game as well

1374
02:39:48,520 --> 02:39:52,080
Okay, I will be a moment. Give me a couple of minutes, please

1375
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:55,760
And please do hydrae and stretch and

1376
02:39:57,040 --> 02:40:00,840
Get some food as well and do a tinkle because it's not good to hold the lock

1377
02:40:04,880 --> 02:40:06,960
Do it do it now

1378
02:40:11,160 --> 02:40:17,640
Okay, I'm very bad. Give me four minutes four minutes pee and microwave stuff. I don't know, okay

1379
02:40:22,160 --> 02:40:25,200
How so sienna and neither the witch salt fire

1380
02:40:26,160 --> 02:40:28,720
Nor the disciplined wizard my tutor hopes to show

1381
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:30,640
Well, that's

1382
02:40:30,640 --> 02:40:37,680
Good I used to think so but if I can't be one I must be the other that's what I was taught

1383
02:40:52,080 --> 02:41:02,560
Looks like the twin-tailed comics return salt spire, what do you make it speaks to dire time to have

1384
02:41:02,960 --> 02:41:10,400
But promises victory record old sigmo more might actually pitch in certainly if we deserve

1385
02:41:22,320 --> 02:41:24,320
You

1386
02:41:40,160 --> 02:41:42,160
You're an engineer now

1387
02:41:42,960 --> 02:41:44,960
Always was sudden in my heart

1388
02:41:45,440 --> 02:41:51,760
Just letting it shine if that's all good repression is bad for the spirit. I never repress anything

1389
02:41:52,080 --> 02:41:54,400
I have noticed

1390
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:24,080
You

1391
02:42:52,080 --> 02:42:54,080
I

1392
02:43:00,720 --> 02:43:01,520
Thought in

1393
02:43:01,520 --> 02:43:05,360
We won't take a look at the action or more repeating handgun. It's sticking something fierce

1394
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:08,160
Oh, so this is how it's going to be. Is it

1395
02:43:08,800 --> 02:43:12,960
Fixing all the people's weapons for you engineers love fixing things

1396
02:43:13,600 --> 02:43:20,000
Not sure about how the rest of us mistreat them. I've got a large part of that getting the complaining in the front

1397
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:24,080
I

1398
02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:54,080
I

1399
02:43:54,080 --> 02:43:56,080
I

1400
02:43:56,080 --> 02:43:58,080
I

1401
02:43:58,080 --> 02:44:00,080
I

1402
02:44:00,080 --> 02:44:02,080
I

1403
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:05,040
I

1404
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:07,040
I

1405
02:44:21,040 --> 02:44:23,040
I heard loner speak of your father

1406
02:44:24,720 --> 02:44:27,120
He sounds like a stolen soul

1407
02:44:27,760 --> 02:44:31,280
I he was certainly that rigid inflexible

1408
02:44:31,760 --> 02:44:33,760
Certain of everything you see

1409
02:44:34,800 --> 02:44:38,000
Precisely the proper role model in this wicked world

1410
02:44:38,800 --> 02:44:42,800
He's all that too. I can't say he was wholly right about it

1411
02:44:43,040 --> 02:44:45,040
Hi, baby

1412
02:44:45,680 --> 02:44:49,520
I got cola I got water. I've got my chingney

1413

02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:59,680
Why are you gifting bro? I wasn't I was yeah, I'm okay. I'm not even on the pc

1415
02:45:01,280 --> 02:45:03,280
I'm amt

1416
02:45:03,280 --> 02:45:08,960
I'm literally half way across the room right now. I'm gonna open the door because the pc heats the room up

1417
02:45:09,520 --> 02:45:12,720
But the like the actual coast is full for the cat

1418
02:45:18,080 --> 02:45:19,920
Thank you so much

1419
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:21,920
There's a gifted membership. Holy crap

1420
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:26,560
What's going on? Is this because I posted my ass be honest?

1421
02:45:27,440 --> 02:45:29,440
What's going on?

1422
02:45:29,920 --> 02:45:32,160
Did anyone puke while I was away be honest?

1423
02:45:33,120 --> 02:45:36,560
Money ritual to summon mummy knows how it works for me

1424
02:45:37,440 --> 02:45:42,960
Not a part of my interest right? Who have we got on this beloved mission?

1425
02:45:44,240 --> 02:45:48,080
We have quests. We have callie

1426
02:45:48,880 --> 02:45:51,520
And we have gar funkel

1427
02:45:51,520 --> 02:45:54,560
I'm tempted to go back to karak gnawn and join the engineers

1428
02:45:56,720 --> 02:45:58,720
I'll be hold on I need to

1429
02:46:00,080 --> 02:46:02,080
Holds off. Excuse me real quick

1430
02:46:03,040 --> 02:46:05,040
And we're in like this like

1431
02:46:07,440 --> 02:46:13,200
Was too hot so I'm using it as a blanket. I picked a little bit but I cleaned it up like a big boy. Yeah

1432
02:46:14,320 --> 02:46:18,160
That's cute. I'm glad I left to get dinner and come back and spinny's left those

1433
02:46:19,120 --> 02:46:21,120
That's it. I'm never eating again

1434
02:46:21,280 --> 02:46:26,160
The people who have the most power within the empire have a code innocence proves nothing

1435
02:46:26,480 --> 02:46:28,480
Uh-huh

1436
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:32,160
The people who have the most powers in the empire have a code innocent

1437
02:46:35,200 --> 02:46:38,240
Sticky shred, thank you for the super chat

1438
02:46:40,160 --> 02:46:43,600
Um, we didn't know that wait pearly

1439
02:46:43,600 --> 02:46:51,840
Pearly and more why why are you giving me so much money? What's going on?

1440
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:55,600
Did I do something special to

1441
02:46:56,480 --> 02:46:58,480
earn this

1442
02:46:59,040 --> 02:47:01,760
It's not clicking. Why are you giving me so much money?

1443
02:47:04,960 --> 02:47:09,120
So my favorite war hammer 40 k lore is the orcs power of belief

1444
02:47:09,520 --> 02:47:15,520
If they believe in something no matter how broken or stupid it actually is it somehow just works

1445
02:47:16,080 --> 02:47:20,720
For example, the color red somehow makes them go faster. Are you squinting me?

1446
02:47:20,720 --> 02:47:22,720
Oh cars go

1447
02:47:22,880 --> 02:47:24,880
How much for my name to be written on that?

1448
02:47:25,360 --> 02:47:27,360
Brian

1449
02:47:27,440 --> 02:47:29,440
You can't ask questions like that

1450
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:33,600
Um

1451
02:47:34,560 --> 02:47:36,560
Hold on

1452
02:47:38,400 --> 02:47:41,360
Uh, thank you stash power for the super chat and the booty lord

1453
02:47:42,320 --> 02:47:47,840
Favorite war hammer lore is the orc power of belief if they believe in something no matter how broken or stupid it is

1454
02:47:47,840 --> 02:47:48,880
It is

1455
02:47:48,880 --> 02:47:50,880
Momolo, what the fuck are you?

1456
02:47:51,200 --> 02:47:57,760
Please tell me you have no debts to your name. You're saving your money. You're eating well. You're eating steak every night

1457
02:47:58,320 --> 02:48:00,320
caveman eat meat like

1458
02:48:01,120 --> 02:48:07,360
Thank you so much for the gifted memberships. Please make sure you're looking after yourself first though. I promise you

1459
02:48:08,400 --> 02:48:14,640
Things are going very well a velar headquarters. Please don't worry. You don't have to do that. I'm very supported. Thank you

1460
02:48:15,680 --> 02:48:20,880
Holy shaito is is it war hammer that everyone's excited about?

1461
02:48:20,880 --> 02:48:22,880
Oh

1462
02:48:24,560 --> 02:48:30,400
My gosh, momolo cast get loved stony stony flails around at it. I'm like

1463
02:48:33,600 --> 02:48:39,120
Orc spaceships are just junk wait, there's space battles in this game. I thought it was

1464
02:48:40,080 --> 02:48:42,080
I thought it was medieval lore

1465
02:48:43,120 --> 02:48:45,440
Why it's not medieval is it?

1466
02:48:46,560 --> 02:48:47,920
at all

1467
02:48:47,920 --> 02:48:49,920
How much to get my name written on the cake?

1468
02:48:50,320 --> 02:48:52,080
uh

1469
02:48:52,080 --> 02:48:55,760
Oh, we're gonna discuss my doughnut thong shortly

1470
02:48:57,040 --> 02:49:00,960
Because I wanted to make sure that no one's gonna hate me or anything

1471
02:49:05,440 --> 02:49:09,920
A vermin tate is kind of because it's an apocalypse, but actual warhammers that sci-fi

1472
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:15,040
Okay

1473
02:49:16,240 --> 02:49:18,240
Hmm

1474
02:49:19,920 --> 02:49:21,920
I'm a bit of a sucker for

1475
02:49:22,480 --> 02:49:24,480
Sorry, I'm choking. Excuse me

1476
02:49:25,360 --> 02:49:27,360
I think I'm a sucker for

1477
02:49:28,160 --> 02:49:30,560
medieval kind of sentence and sci-fi

1478
02:49:31,360 --> 02:49:33,360
um

1479
02:49:40,960 --> 02:49:42,960
Sci-fi fantasy

1480
02:49:44,400 --> 02:49:47,920
He don't okay. I'm eating right now. I'm so sorry. Uh

1481
02:49:48,880 --> 02:49:52,080
I need to refill for the battles ahead

1482
02:49:53,680 --> 02:49:58,480
Because how am I supposed to do all these fights with no energy in my body?

1483
02:50:02,880 --> 02:50:05,760
I saw I'll take the tentacle everyone

1484
02:50:07,200 --> 02:50:11,680
You're so direct today. I wonder why are you squiddling me right now?

1485
02:50:12,560 --> 02:50:14,560
Oh

1486
02:50:16,720 --> 02:50:19,920
Okay, that was good. I'll give you home. Thank you

1487
02:50:24,880 --> 02:50:28,240
4k is a spin-off in the year 40

1488
02:50:29,440 --> 02:50:32,960
Is it in it's not in the same world where you be and I'm eating

1489
02:50:34,160 --> 02:50:37,120
My chinese aunties noodles and they're delicious

1490
02:50:41,760 --> 02:50:45,440
For the butt of his job the butt of his job

1491
02:50:49,520 --> 02:50:56,400
Kinda same gods and similar story, but different same world before it doesn't use in the future. So humans did prevail

1492
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:07,360
I know you guys have you know, I'm getting a hungry for cake right now. How odd you guys

1493
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:15,840
It's funny because you're trying to summer up summarize something so expansive and vast for me to like comprehend

1494
02:51:17,360 --> 02:51:21,520
So it's like good good for me to take things at face value and be like

1495
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,960
Okay, different universe, but kind of the same but later and there are gods

1496
02:51:24,960 --> 02:51:29,520
But I don't know what happens to the gods in the sci-fi part like it's good to take things at face value like that

1497
02:51:30,400 --> 02:51:36,400
I'm quite hungry for cake too now that you've mentioned it

03:01:13,860 --> 03:01:19,940
Oh my god, I'm gonna sound tired on stream and the reeflings are gonna think I'm not interested when it's not

1611
03:01:19,940 --> 03:01:21,540

And you're suggesting left for dead and I'm like well now that we can stream snipe each other

1657
03:05:03,780 --> 03:05:05,780
It's not a problem. Um

It's me. It's not just verbally like of course. I appreciate it. I just find

1661
03:05:20,020 --> 03:05:21,620
That there's

03:05:21,620 --> 03:05:24,100
It's not that it's empty to say. Thank you

1663
03:05:24,660 --> 03:05:30,580
But for my personal preference, I just want to offer something a bit more. I want there

1664
03:05:31,220 --> 03:05:34,180
To be like so obviously if you support me

1665
03:05:35,140 --> 03:05:41,060
You know it helps out with the success of the girls as a whole basically

1666
03:05:42,500 --> 03:05:48,580
Like obviously we've got something exciting coming up, which I doubt anyone's gonna guess to be honest. So get fucked. Um

1667
03:05:51,620 --> 03:05:56,580
Type thing and then it also like helps with the success of me because um I

1668
03:05:59,140 --> 03:06:00,740
With my

1669
03:06:00,740 --> 03:06:03,380
Come once the you know the company

1670
03:06:04,580 --> 03:06:06,580
Um has made return on investment

1671
03:06:06,660 --> 03:06:11,380
I can start looking at my income and being like well, I think I can afford like an all outfit that maybe looks

1672
03:06:12,020 --> 03:06:16,340
Sorry, I'm burping up my foot. It looks like a bit more like me type thing and like

1673
03:06:17,700 --> 03:06:22,420
With that like I would do new role plays and new things and like the hypnosis streamer

1674
03:06:22,500 --> 03:06:28,420
Aren't really well. So I want to do more hypnosis stuff like I mean I always wanted to do hypnosis stuff, you know

Who goes there and you guys are finishing the length for me. You've got strong a brain roll. I'm sorry, but you've got level

1676
03:06:36,900 --> 03:06:41,620
You've got tier three strong a brain wrong. Sorry. You had to find out this way

1677
03:06:42,740 --> 03:06:44,740

Okay, let's go

1679
03:06:48,340 --> 03:06:50,340
Oh, that's the bomb

1680
03:06:51,700 --> 03:06:54,500
I do like the bomb mechanic in this game

1681
03:06:55,460 --> 03:07:00,660
But wait, is that a bomb a reference to the hit video game the binding of Isaac?

1682
03:07:08,580 --> 03:07:11,220
I can't see him. How did you snipe him? What the heck?

1683
03:07:12,020 --> 03:07:14,340
You must have been a college

1684
03:07:14,340 --> 03:07:17,220
We are gaining the strong to them. I'm rubbing off on you

1685
03:07:17,940 --> 03:07:24,020
I'm rubbing off. I've got my chair spinning on its own. I literally were sideways playing on my seat there

1686
03:07:24,660 --> 03:07:26,660
Where are we going?

1687
03:07:26,980 --> 03:07:30,980
Where are we going? No one's knowing although it looks like it's down here if I've ever seen a place to go

1688
03:07:31,780 --> 03:07:34,740
And before I've done this and I'm just dead on my own because I'm a dumb dumb

1689
03:07:36,900 --> 03:07:39,860
River ale I don't think I was supposed to come here

1690
03:07:41,380 --> 03:07:43,380
I don't think I was supposed to come here

03:08:15,940 --> 03:08:18,100
Not to be confused worse the sire trout

1697
03:08:19,700 --> 03:08:22,180
Oh my gosh, I hope that other reefing's okay

Whoa, what's this?

1703
03:08:51,620 --> 03:08:53,620

03:09:17,140 --> 03:09:19,140
He's all stitched together

1710
03:09:19,860 --> 03:09:21,860
I'm mutated or

1711
03:09:23,300 --> 03:09:25,300
Light work

1712
03:09:25,540 --> 03:09:29,780
Rat brothers rise stony calls for aids the reeflings will answer real answer

1713
03:09:30,500 --> 03:09:33,220
I follow the green outline. Follow the green

1714
03:09:34,260 --> 03:09:36,260
Follow the green outline

1715
03:09:37,300 --> 03:09:40,580
Some magic stuff going on over there or something I can hear a lot from the face

1716
03:09:42,340 --> 03:09:45,060
Ambience more hammer to ambient face more

1717
03:09:45,700 --> 03:09:50,420
No, I'm just following you. Don't don't look at me for directions. You're the one who's played this game. No me

1718
03:09:51,300 --> 03:09:55,220
Don't look at me. No, you go find the way you go. You gotta show me where those reeflings are

1719
03:09:55,860 --> 03:10:01,860
Is it this way? I'm standing guard. Okay. Okay. That's fair. Well, so I still have to figure out what the goal

1720
03:10:04,580 --> 03:10:06,980
Oh, wait, you guys were doing like a wrap around

1721
03:10:08,980 --> 03:10:11,300
The cake is posted stony calls for aids

1722
03:10:11,620 --> 03:10:16,900
Bro, I felt so brain dead like typing because I knew the numbers were wrong on my butt

1723
03:10:17,620 --> 03:10:23,540
So I was like typing and I was like I literally couldn't figure out how to like write it on myself

1724
03:10:24,740 --> 03:10:26,740
and

1725
03:10:27,220 --> 03:10:33,540
Like I just couldn't do the two and like my brain was short circuiting because I was like oh wipe off and do it again

1726
03:10:33,780 --> 03:10:38,100
But it's like I just never did it. I just like went for it. And I'm like, what was I thinking?

1727
03:10:38,180 --> 03:10:40,180
Oh

1728
03:10:40,420 --> 03:10:47,220
I'm just no very smart. I'm just no smart. Honestly. Oh my god. Wait, we're playing hard difficulty. Whoopsies

1729
03:10:48,260 --> 03:10:50,260
Who is brain like that?

1730
03:10:53,380 --> 03:10:55,380
Okay, I'm just fighting demons right now

1731
03:11:01,860 --> 03:11:05,060
Get out of here get out of here you stinky man

1732
03:11:05,380 --> 03:11:10,180
No one was focusing in on the numbers. Thank god

1733
03:11:12,340 --> 03:11:13,620
Thank god

1734
03:11:13,620 --> 03:11:18,820
Because it's really awful when I when I mentioned it and you guys were like there was numbers and I'm like, yeah

1735
03:11:19,460 --> 03:11:21,460
I drew on my

1736
03:11:23,460 --> 03:11:28,980
God, you guys were not kidding when you said there's literally no heels whatsoever as soon as you go up in difficulty

1737
03:11:30,100 --> 03:11:32,100
I'm trying to get some heels for you

1738
03:11:35,780 --> 03:11:37,780
Oh

1739
03:11:38,900 --> 03:11:40,900
Are we okay

1740
03:11:43,940 --> 03:11:46,740
I'm trying. Oh shit

1741
03:11:49,860 --> 03:11:52,900
Hopefully that works right a hipfire works in this game surely

1742
03:11:56,260 --> 03:11:58,980
If there's a spider on me right now, I think I'm going crazy

1743
03:12:06,020 --> 03:12:10,820
I was focused on something else the male brain is simple some may say

1744
03:12:12,100 --> 03:12:17,620
We playing there's a healing there. I think the I think the dwarf needs to heal in the most right now

1745
03:12:23,060 --> 03:12:26,260
Uh, I guess I'll hold on to the medical supply

1746
03:12:29,300 --> 03:12:31,300
Yes, thank you

1747
03:12:32,180 --> 03:12:38,820
I mean, I didn't notice the numbers. I mean, I love your honesty about it though. Like, yeah, I was focusing on something else

1748
03:12:39,860 --> 03:12:41,860

I'm happy to take up strings if you're anything. Are you watching my butt?

1752
03:13:06,500 --> 03:13:08,500
Thank you for the gift

1753
03:13:11,140 --> 03:13:13,140
We flings we're making a ring

1754
03:13:16,180 --> 03:13:23,140
Mummy you're rubbing off of me my thoughts or voice in my head. Have a Scottish accent now. Oh, stop. That's so cute

1755
03:13:23,460 --> 03:13:25,460
I love that so much

1756
03:13:26,980 --> 03:13:30,660
Oh my god, wait, I need to do like a heavy Scottish accent

1757
03:13:32,100 --> 03:13:35,780
Uh, what would your internal thoughts be? I have no idea

1758
03:13:37,140 --> 03:13:40,020
Actually, what is the average internal thought of a refling?

1759
03:13:41,300 --> 03:13:43,300
Please do not say puke

1760
03:13:44,180 --> 03:13:46,420
I'm here so you can't say puke. That's not allowed

1761
03:13:49,700 --> 03:13:53,620
I wasn't paying attention. I'm sorry. Uh, I think I'm gonna have to chug jug

1762
03:13:54,100 --> 03:13:59,140
Oh, dear. That was silly. Sorry. I should have paid more attention

1763
03:14:00,420 --> 03:14:07,700
I literally just got jumped. I don't pay attention for one second and vermin tight. I'm starting to understand why the lures like this

1764
03:14:10,420 --> 03:14:16,820
Get right get right get right. I'm reaching the inner courtyard. I'm reaching the inner courtyard so hard right now

1765
03:14:18,900 --> 03:14:20,900
Oh

1766
03:14:21,860 --> 03:14:23,860
I don't know if I hit him or not

1767
03:14:25,220 --> 03:14:27,940
Wow, I'm swinging

1768
03:14:30,820 --> 03:14:32,820
There's supplies here

1769
03:14:34,100 --> 03:14:41,780
What is it one mid kit? I'll carry it for oh, no, no, no, no. I need to heal you. I need to heal you

1770
03:14:42,660 --> 03:14:44,660
Oh

1771
03:14:46,900 --> 03:14:51,700
Oh my god, uh, this is hard with the totems on regular difficulty

1772
03:14:53,940 --> 03:14:58,820
This is not easy like we're already lower health than usual because of the totem

1773
03:15:00,100 --> 03:15:02,100
But the heels are non-existent

1774
03:15:03,380 --> 03:15:06,260
I thought you guys were being dramatic saying like oh

1775
03:15:06,260 --> 03:15:08,260
Okay

1776
03:15:09,220 --> 03:15:12,820
Oh my gosh, it's just an onslaught

1777
03:15:15,060 --> 03:15:20,580
They're never ending. How fast do they breed? Oh give me three of a hold on

1778
03:15:22,260 --> 03:15:26,100
Oh, I need to be able that was embarrassing. Oh, no, just

1779
03:15:27,460 --> 03:15:29,620
Took on so much unnecessary damage

1780
03:15:29,940 --> 03:15:38,100
Are we even going the right way? Yeah, we have to be what's the other leafland doing back here? Is he timed out?

1781
03:15:43,780 --> 03:15:45,940
Is he popping fireworks in there?

1782
03:15:49,380 --> 03:15:56,820
Is that a sound effect going wrong pick up a tone shisa right dad drink this

1783
03:15:59,620 --> 03:16:01,620
And confusion to our phones

1784
03:16:02,340 --> 03:16:04,340
Okay, okay, okay

1785
03:16:04,740 --> 03:16:06,740
They breed almost as fast as you

1786
03:16:09,460 --> 03:16:12,660
But it took me a year to birth my daughters, okay

1787
03:16:13,460 --> 03:16:15,460
There are five of them just dating in there

1788
03:16:16,420 --> 03:16:18,420
We gaming now

1789
03:16:18,900 --> 03:16:23,380
I think that I don't know if there's a sound effect that's misfiring right now. It sounds like fireworks popping

1790
03:16:24,420 --> 03:16:27,060
Sorry if you can hear that I can I can definitely hear it

1791
03:16:30,340 --> 03:16:37,220
If you alternate between heavy and light attack you can combo only sweep that's good against hoarders

1792
03:16:38,820 --> 03:16:42,500
I was not bluffing when I said the heels get rare. No, you weren't literally

1793
03:16:43,540 --> 03:16:45,540
I thought it was

1794
03:16:45,620 --> 03:16:47,620
this is like really bad

1795
03:16:49,380 --> 03:16:51,380
And the music's getting tense out of nowhere

1796
03:16:56,420 --> 03:16:58,420
Leave me alone

1797
03:16:59,780 --> 03:17:01,780
Take the ammo

1798
03:17:03,940 --> 03:17:10,900
Who defend the gate how to what's the point of defending anyone? There's no one here. No one's alive

1799
03:17:11,700 --> 03:17:14,260
It's just us and the onslaught

1800
03:17:15,940 --> 03:17:17,940
This spawn camp the gate I guess

1801
03:17:20,740 --> 03:17:22,740
I gotta cheat no one's one second

1802
03:17:30,580 --> 03:17:33,140
Fire the cannon at the cat poles, okay

1803
03:17:37,700 --> 03:17:42,740
Hold on. I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm coming to help. I'm coming to help. No, no, no, no, no

1804
03:17:48,100 --> 03:17:53,220
We're helping we're helping I don't have a heel unfortunately. I don't know where they're hiding any

1805
03:17:53,940 --> 03:18:00,740
Do we need to drop these totem things I don't know

1806
03:18:03,460 --> 03:18:05,460
I'm helping

1807
03:18:11,140 --> 03:18:12,660
Oh

1808
03:18:12,660 --> 03:18:14,740
You did it

1809
03:18:14,740 --> 03:18:15,940
aim

1810
03:18:15,940 --> 03:18:17,220
Aim at wall

1811
03:18:17,220 --> 03:18:21,700
I have no idea. I'll protect you. I don't know what I'm aiming at. I'm I'm just I'll

1812
03:18:22,660 --> 03:18:24,980
I'll pretend to freaking help

1813
03:18:26,420 --> 03:18:33,380
I'm spamming you aim it. I'm spamming. Don't worry. I'm fighting. I'm really good at shadow boxing. I promise

1814
03:18:34,340 --> 03:18:36,340
It's actually one of my favorite hobbies

1815
03:18:42,100 --> 03:18:46,820
They're not gonna give up their tomes they are loot boosters. Did I get more XP for them?

1816
03:18:47,780 --> 03:18:52,260
I mean, it definitely does make it harder since it steals all our HP

1817
03:18:57,220 --> 03:18:59,220
Oh

1818
03:19:04,500 --> 03:19:07,540
I'll get scared. I don't know if I'm gonna survive

1819
03:19:07,700 --> 03:19:09,700
Oh

1820
03:19:13,780 --> 03:19:17,140
Something bumped me in my butt something poisonous

1821
03:19:19,540 --> 03:19:24,260
Loot the cannon we're trying there's so much going on

1822
03:19:27,700 --> 03:19:32,820
Uh, I guess every time we get revived and picked up we have some of our health back

1823
03:19:33,540 --> 03:19:37,380
Oh my god, the cannon ball is all the way over there

1824
03:19:42,980 --> 03:19:49,700
Uh, uh, maybe I can take aggro. Is that even a thing in this game? I don't know

1825
03:19:52,580 --> 03:19:57,620
Oh my gosh, I don't know how to do the cannon ball. I assume it just bring over

1826
03:19:58,420 --> 03:20:02,740
Oh my god, there's so much growling. There's so much

1827
03:20:07,140 --> 03:20:09,300
Oh my goodness, is that you?

1828
03:20:12,020 --> 03:20:18,660
Are we winning? I think maybe I don't know. Oh no, we need to protect the reflin. They're really low

1829
03:20:20,820 --> 03:20:27,220
They're really low. I'm protecting. I'm shadow boxing so hard right now. They're not even spawned in and I'm already swinging on

1830
03:20:28,580 --> 03:20:34,500
I'll try no refling. Oh my god. I thought you dropped it

1831
03:20:35,700 --> 03:20:39,460
Did you do it? Is it done? Is it over? Is it over?

1832
03:20:40,260 --> 03:20:42,260
I destroyed the cat vault

1833
03:20:44,580 --> 03:20:47,540
Break the siege what we need to do that again

1834
03:20:49,380 --> 03:20:52,340
I don't think any of us have enough HP for doing that again

1835
03:20:53,300 --> 03:20:56,260
It reminds me of shibali and this is shibali

1836
03:20:57,860 --> 03:21:00,660
The growling is just the feral reflin

1837
03:21:03,380 --> 03:21:05,380
What are you doing nothing just swinging around

1838
03:21:07,300 --> 03:21:09,300
Follow the reflings follow the reflings

1839
03:21:10,100 --> 03:21:14,180
Help the reflings help the reflings stay with the reflings stay with the reflings

1840
03:21:14,740 --> 03:21:17,700
Escape through the bridge of shadows. I'm trying

1841
03:21:18,740 --> 03:21:20,900
I'm needing to adjust to my little gamer chair

1842
03:21:21,140 --> 03:21:30,980
His tentacles too slippery. He's dropping his balls. That doesn't work at all. Oh, we did it

1843
03:21:31,700 --> 03:21:36,820
We won our first veteran difficulty or whatever difficulty. We did it

1844
03:21:37,540 --> 03:21:43,140
We did it. We did it. We did our first victory on a hard mode on a hard mode

1845
03:21:43,940 --> 03:21:45,940
That was a bit more stressful

1846
03:21:46,420 --> 03:21:53,300
I didn't enjoy that there was less health. I I actually prefer the health being everywhere. I can't believe it

1847
03:21:53,940 --> 03:21:56,100
so

1848
03:21:56,100 --> 03:21:58,100
Grim wars gave us an extra 200

1849
03:21:59,060 --> 03:22:01,060
level up

1850
03:22:01,140 --> 03:22:03,140
Her a foot knight

1851
03:22:03,780 --> 03:22:08,420
I'll a sword and shield if I wanted to do that. I don't know. I quite like the big sweepy

1852
03:22:09,140 --> 03:22:11,140
the sweepy action

1853
03:22:11,380 --> 03:22:14,580
Let's start blocking and pushing. I don't even know I could push

1854
03:22:16,900 --> 03:22:19,380
Spoils of war chest upgraded

1855
03:22:22,420 --> 03:22:25,540
We get like a a chest every time

1856
03:22:27,940 --> 03:22:31,220
I'm observing the system. So depending on how well we do

1857
03:22:32,500 --> 03:22:37,780
We can upgrade a chest into like an ultimate one. So it means we get really well

1858
03:22:38,740 --> 03:22:40,740
We've saved

1859
03:22:42,820 --> 03:22:44,820
The foot knight

1860
03:22:45,780 --> 03:22:47,780
Did I get one thing? I didn't

1861
03:22:49,540 --> 03:22:54,980
Bra, I didn't get one thing. I got 69 headshots though. So nice

1862
03:22:56,180 --> 03:22:58,180
nice

1863
03:22:59,060 --> 03:23:03,060
Higher difficulties give better chest that tomes just multiply it

1864
03:23:03,780 --> 03:23:07,380
Okay, I mean are you playing against other people?

1865
03:23:08,500 --> 03:23:13,380
Uh, I'm playing with refling. I made a stream sniping account

1866
03:23:14,580 --> 03:23:17,380
So not anyone can add me but stream sniping adventures

1867
03:23:19,620 --> 03:23:22,180
The fortnight metal pan

1868
03:23:23,700 --> 03:23:25,140
I just

1869
03:23:25,140 --> 03:23:27,140
Emma

1870
03:23:27,300 --> 03:23:29,300
And I booted up my PC

1871
03:23:29,860 --> 03:23:35,140
Because I need me to get that fortnight battle

1872
03:23:39,380 --> 03:23:41,380
Oh, yeah

1873
03:23:41,700 --> 03:23:46,580
Things and stuff. Let's go open one, please since there's only one

1874
03:23:49,060 --> 03:23:55,140
I'm in the battle pass kicks and I can't stop I can't even stop singing that. I need to give that rest. Yeah rest. Yeah

1875
03:23:55,140 --> 03:23:57,140
All right

1876
03:23:59,220 --> 03:24:01,220
Uh

1877
03:24:02,180 --> 03:24:04,180
That one's a big boy

1878
03:24:04,580 --> 03:24:10,420
Got a big meaty swing tom. I'm sorry. It's it's not even it's not even closely. Did I even name us?

1879
03:24:10,500 --> 03:24:14,660
I didn't even name that team. I'm so sorry, right? What would quest cali

1880
03:24:15,380 --> 03:24:17,380
gir funkel

1881
03:24:19,140 --> 03:24:21,140
What would I even call that team

1882
03:24:22,100 --> 03:24:24,340
Wait, what's the name of the difficulty?

1883
03:24:25,300 --> 03:24:27,300
Veterans I'm just gonna call

1884
03:24:27,380 --> 03:24:31,140
As the veterans because we that was the first time we ever won on there

1885
03:24:32,340 --> 03:24:34,340
Thank you

1886
03:24:35,220 --> 03:24:41,780
Thanks for the game. Thank you call us the disconnectors. Okay, I'll put veterans and then underneath I'll put the disconnectors

1887
03:24:43,380 --> 03:24:49,860
Because we did have a few connection issues the neglected studio and the lost ones unarmed

1888
03:24:50,980 --> 03:24:52,980
Okay, you have moat on me

1889
03:24:55,300 --> 03:24:57,620
You're fun time's dead ahead

1890
03:24:58,340 --> 03:25:00,340

03:25:00,900 --> 03:25:04,740
Okay, I put the verns the disconnectors and then the forgotten as well

1892
03:25:06,260 --> 03:25:10,340
No, wait the forgotten is like so negative. It's a sinky. Bye. Bye

1893
03:25:11,700 --> 03:25:16,500
Do you not miss the army life sergeant comrade and army comrades?

1894
03:25:18,020 --> 03:25:20,020
Comrade

1895
03:25:20,180 --> 03:25:23,620
I know we've got harsh actions. Let's get it on the verns. Okay

1896
03:25:23,860 --> 03:25:26,740
Tiger site, you haven't played with us before

1897
03:25:27,460 --> 03:25:29,700
No, you haven't okay tiger site

1898
03:25:31,060 --> 03:25:34,900
I will put your name down. Is there any other reef ones that haven't had a chance?

1899
03:25:36,420 --> 03:25:38,740
Dash power you haven't been in

1900
03:25:41,860 --> 03:25:46,900
And then who's gonna make up the third member that was fun. You enjoyed it

1901
03:25:46,900 --> 03:25:52,580
Yeah, you liked carrying me through the game and I didn't have to do anything because I'm I'm a weakling

1902
03:25:54,100 --> 03:25:57,220
Call me a weakling because I'm I'm weak and terrible like me

1903
03:25:58,100 --> 03:26:03,300
And I have awful reaction time as well. Is there any reefing that wants to invite themselves into the load?

1904
03:26:04,180 --> 03:26:08,500
I've added all friend requests. So yeah, if you've not had a chance yet

1905
03:26:09,700 --> 03:26:16,260
Dear strongy, I'm thinking of growing a mustache to see if it looks good on me. Can I borrow your your clam curls?

1906
03:26:19,540 --> 03:26:22,100
Does that mean fanny flaps be honest

1907
03:26:24,260 --> 03:26:26,260
Clam car rolls

1908
03:26:28,740 --> 03:26:30,980
Are we out of reeflings is everyone played?

1909
03:26:32,980 --> 03:26:37,860
If everyone has played oh, no, is that someone who hasn't played yet? Okay, no, there you go

1910
03:26:38,980 --> 03:26:40,980
You've not played

1911
03:26:42,580 --> 03:26:44,580
Written in the wrong color pen

1912
03:26:45,460 --> 03:26:47,460
Do the

1913
03:26:47,540 --> 03:26:50,980
Okay, we have tiger site. We have stash power and we have dodomo

1914
03:26:51,220 --> 03:26:53,220
On the right

1915
03:26:58,740 --> 03:27:04,980
I got my wisdom tooth pulled out because it was pushing on my other teeth and

1916
03:27:07,380 --> 03:27:12,580
They gave me kakora mod never had it before hold on wait, I'm gonna put my hoodie back on because I'm getting a bitch

1917
03:27:13,940 --> 03:27:15,940
I'm getting cold

1918
03:27:21,300 --> 03:27:23,300
On

1919
03:27:24,820 --> 03:27:30,580
She wrong is all right, I don't have the theme landing strip if you will. Oh, right. No

1920
03:27:32,420 --> 03:27:34,420
You didn't see the picture yesterday

1921
03:27:35,300 --> 03:27:40,100
Oh wait, I understand now. I get it. I get it. Oh my god. I'm so dumb

1922
03:27:40,260 --> 03:27:45,380
I understand what you mean by saying I want to test out a mustache. Okay, that makes sense

1923
03:27:46,180 --> 03:27:52,260
Okay, but the reason why it doesn't make sense with me in particular is because

1924
03:27:54,020 --> 03:27:56,020
I'm hairless

1925
03:27:58,100 --> 03:28:05,060
Okay, right played 400 vermin tide one, but only three hours of two. Oh no is vermin tide one better

1926
03:28:05,300 --> 03:28:07,300
Oh

1927
03:28:08,820 --> 03:28:10,820
People need to warn mommy

1928
03:28:11,540 --> 03:28:14,420
Yeah, so I've got my wisdom tooth taken out

1929
03:28:16,820 --> 03:28:18,820
And

1930
03:28:18,980 --> 03:28:22,180
Shawnee's confused because you asked for here she doesn't have basically I was like, hmm

1931
03:28:23,780 --> 03:28:25,780
Uh, I took kakora mall

1932
03:28:26,340 --> 03:28:27,860
I felt

1933
03:28:27,860 --> 03:28:35,220
Violently ill like so ill right we're gonna try vermin, but if I mess it up then we we'll get off it. Um

1934
03:28:36,660 --> 03:28:43,620
For about like 45 minutes like nausea sickness illness and then it just dissipates

1935
03:28:44,820 --> 03:28:48,580
Out of nowhere and like you feel so euphoric because

1936
03:28:49,540 --> 03:28:56,820
Like you don't feel sick anymore and like the pain kicks in and I was like, oh, I see why people are addicted to this now

1937
03:28:57,300 --> 03:29:03,460
Um, so I I didn't take it anymore after that. I was like, fuck. I'm not touching that shit again. Um

1938
03:29:05,460 --> 03:29:07,460
It made me

1939
03:29:09,300 --> 03:29:11,300
Sounds like an allergic reaction to

1940
03:29:15,380 --> 03:29:19,380
While strong is fat eager lass is indeed quite a burden to bear

1941
03:29:19,540 --> 03:29:24,900
I don't think there's a refling among us that would complain about carrying it. It was a pleasure

1942
03:29:25,300 --> 03:29:28,100
Oh, I didn't enjoy it. Thank you coif

1943
03:29:29,300 --> 03:29:31,700
Yeah, you guys like carrying me all the time

1944
03:29:32,580 --> 03:29:35,140
I'll maybe uh, you know how like the

1945
03:29:35,860 --> 03:29:42,260
The whenever it's like pharaohs that are depicted there. It's like cleopatra like on those like, um

1946
03:29:43,220 --> 03:29:46,020
It's like a platform that's held up by four people

1947
03:29:46,500 --> 03:29:50,580
Instead of that. It's just me being like touched on my butt and picked up by

1948
03:29:50,580 --> 03:29:52,580
Oh

1949
03:29:52,820 --> 03:29:54,820
My three reeflings in a war

1950
03:29:55,540 --> 03:29:57,540
and vermin type too, so

1951
03:29:58,260 --> 03:30:00,260
um

1952
03:30:00,500 --> 03:30:02,500
A pagoda

1953
03:30:03,300 --> 03:30:05,300
A pagoda is the platform

1954
03:30:06,660 --> 03:30:08,660
A palikin

1955
03:30:10,420 --> 03:30:14,980
You guys are giving me new vocabulary. I've not yet unlocked

1956
03:30:15,860 --> 03:30:17,860
Although we're in a dwarven mine

1957
03:30:18,660 --> 03:30:25,460
Back in the mine done and done your pickaxe from side to side side side to side

1958
03:30:31,540 --> 03:30:34,020
Palak palak palan king

1959
03:30:35,700 --> 03:30:37,700
Prince palakine

1960
03:30:39,300 --> 03:30:41,300
I'm

1961
03:30:41,540 --> 03:30:43,540
Enjoy learning new vocabulary though

1962
03:30:44,100 --> 03:30:46,100
It's funny

1963
03:30:46,820 --> 03:30:50,260
Well, I'm not sure I could live in a dwarven mine

1964
03:30:50,420 --> 03:30:57,940
I'd need to I need like a little nature strip in a patch and I feel like it'd be so cold and especially it would get so dark so quick

1965
03:31:00,500 --> 03:31:02,100
Who is

1966
03:31:02,100 --> 03:31:04,100
Garevelin

1967
03:31:04,100 --> 03:31:06,100
Oh, that's why

1968
03:31:06,340 --> 03:31:08,340
No, ow, I can't

1969
03:31:08,980 --> 03:31:10,980
Okay

1970
03:31:11,860 --> 03:31:13,860
You

1971
03:31:15,380 --> 03:31:17,380
Right, no

1972
03:31:20,100 --> 03:31:22,100
What are you

1973
03:31:22,820 --> 03:31:29,380
Okay, I need to be careful with my hp because we're not playing easy mode anymore. It must remember not an easy mode

1974
03:31:30,660 --> 03:31:32,660
Not an easy mode not easy mode

1975
03:31:32,660 --> 03:31:34,660
Don't be any worse than me

1976
03:31:34,900 --> 03:31:40,500
Me pray me praying that all the reeflings I'm playing with actually don't know where the

1977
03:31:43,060 --> 03:31:49,220
Okay, this is like a back off kind of thing. So if I block okay, I can like block and push back. Okay. I'm learning

1978
03:31:49,940 --> 03:31:54,180
Only been playing this game for three hours and I've discovered that I can do that. How lovely

1979
03:31:56,820 --> 03:31:58,820
Okay

1980
03:31:59,620 --> 03:32:01,620
Something took me long enough

1981
03:32:02,740 --> 03:32:04,740
I held off a heart on mine

1982
03:32:05,380 --> 03:32:07,380
How far away are you?

1983
03:32:07,620 --> 03:32:09,620
She's looese reefling

1984
03:32:10,260 --> 03:32:12,260
On the other side of the map

1985
03:32:13,780 --> 03:32:17,060
Are we playing legendary we're playing veteran right now

1986
03:32:17,860 --> 03:32:19,860
Actually, I've not named this team

1987
03:32:21,540 --> 03:32:24,020
You're all wearing green except green

1988
03:32:25,620 --> 03:32:31,380
Just instead of duck duck ghost is green green red. Okay. That'll instead of duck. Okay green

1989
03:32:32,340 --> 03:32:35,540
Green red. That's what we're called

1990
03:32:40,580 --> 03:32:44,340
Oh, I never even checked if the game was making my stream like have I been lagging

1991
03:32:46,580 --> 03:32:50,660
Have I been lagging this whole time and I've not paid attention

1992
03:32:53,220 --> 03:32:58,420
Could have almost now you're good. Okay. I'm glad uh, I'll pick this up for

1993
03:32:59,060 --> 03:33:02,420
Now, I guess and then I can heal a reefling if they go

1994
03:33:03,620 --> 03:33:07,700
I don't think so. It's okay. Okay. Literally. I got so excited to play with you guys

1995
03:33:07,780 --> 03:33:10,980
I forgot to do the old test that it's not lagging anything out

1996
03:33:11,540 --> 03:33:15,940
because sometimes um games will like lag out the

1997
03:33:19,060 --> 03:33:22,580
Beach of her model wait am I going great? Are we supposed to go here?

1998
03:33:25,940 --> 03:33:27,940
Oh, it's so bright

1999
03:33:28,500 --> 03:33:31,700
It's making me yawn. It's fake sunlight brain

2000
03:33:33,300 --> 03:33:35,300
It's fake sunlight

2001
03:33:37,060 --> 03:33:38,980
My brain

2002
03:33:38,980 --> 03:33:42,340
I've not been outside in so long. I just yawned at fake sunlight

2003
03:33:43,540 --> 03:33:46,660
That that's when you know, it's bad. That's when you know, it's bad

2004
03:33:50,740 --> 03:33:53,780
What yeah, because when you get exposed to the sun for some reason you

2005
03:33:58,900 --> 03:34:00,900
I'm trying

2006
03:34:02,500 --> 03:34:05,620
Vampires Johnny you're into the sun suck ink

2007
03:34:05,620 --> 03:34:07,620
Oh

2008
03:34:26,340 --> 03:34:28,340
Spamming

2009
03:34:35,620 --> 03:34:37,620
I

2010
03:34:42,980 --> 03:34:44,980
Don't know where I can't see anything

2011
03:34:48,580 --> 03:34:54,820
It's like chaos one minute as soon as that goes down. Oh god, that's so hypnotic though and making me sweepy

2012
03:34:58,100 --> 03:35:00,740
Kill the vermin before it throws

2013
03:35:01,540 --> 03:35:04,260
Okay, I got the ragged art. That's you know, we're doing good

2014
03:35:06,020 --> 03:35:08,900
Can you like sneak up on that you can't

2015
03:35:11,460 --> 03:35:16,580
No, oh he said fresh me. Oh he wants to eat me

2016
03:35:18,580 --> 03:35:20,580
Oh apparently it was board day the other day

2017
03:35:21,620 --> 03:35:24,740
I redirected into serenity from being here

2018
03:35:25,380 --> 03:35:28,740
And she was like in her mouth and I'm like, what if I just redirected into

2019
03:35:29,300 --> 03:35:31,300
I have no idea what's going on

2020
03:35:32,260 --> 03:35:38,420
I need to heal that reef one that's half health. I will heal you don't take one. Do I heal him? I don't know

2021
03:35:42,900 --> 03:35:47,620
Uh, uh, uh, I don't know. Hey, no, he's half health. That's dangerous

2022
03:35:49,540 --> 03:35:53,860
Okay, it only heals 50% so it wasn't always he has a potion

2023
03:35:55,460 --> 03:35:57,620
Well, someone has to be the heel slag of the team

2024
03:36:02,020 --> 03:36:04,020
Spank even though it was dead

2025
03:36:06,340 --> 03:36:09,620
It's funny trying so hard to be a pocket mirth. They were digging into the ego

2026
03:36:13,380 --> 03:36:18,900
I want to play overwatch together, but I don't think I'm allowed to because it's so boring

2027
03:36:20,260 --> 03:36:24,180
I think it's so boring. I'm not allowed to make it the stream snipe game

2028
03:36:24,900 --> 03:36:29,620
Because they released a new character called Juno who does healing and damage

2029
03:36:29,700 --> 03:36:34,020
Like from the same gun like Anna and I was like, oh, okay, I don't want to play

2030
03:36:34,580 --> 03:36:37,220
But I don't want to bore. I don't want to pick born

2031
03:36:40,340 --> 03:36:42,340
Oh, where you going?

2032
03:36:43,140 --> 03:36:45,300
Uh, what did I do? Did I just stand here?

2033
03:36:47,700 --> 03:36:51,220
Okay, I'm gonna just follow the reeflings. They seem convinced to go down this way. I'm a foal

2034
03:36:52,100 --> 03:36:54,100
I'm following the reef

2035
03:36:56,580 --> 03:36:58,580
A healing draw

2036
03:37:00,500 --> 03:37:05,220
That's actually quite scary when the game whispers randomly

2037
03:37:06,900 --> 03:37:07,700
Oh

2038
03:37:07,700 --> 03:37:10,500
Reefling no, I did nothing to help but hope you're okay

2039
03:37:11,700 --> 03:37:14,660
Right, let's get on this lift type thing

2040
03:37:16,420 --> 03:37:18,420
Everyone on the elevator

2041
03:37:26,900 --> 03:37:28,900
What did I just do

2042
03:37:29,300 --> 03:37:31,300
We're not are we moving

2043
03:37:32,820 --> 03:37:34,820
Did we

2044
03:37:35,860 --> 03:37:37,860
That was not a platform, okay

2045
03:37:42,100 --> 03:37:44,900
Oh, why is that reefling going that way? I don't know

2046
03:37:46,820 --> 03:37:52,740
Might as well grip up. I'd see no reason not to all things considered

2047
03:37:53,300 --> 03:37:55,300
Oh

2048
03:37:58,660 --> 03:38:00,660
Mr

2049
03:38:03,860 --> 03:38:10,260
Uh, I'm just following the reeflings. They want to go this way so follow the reefling reefling reefling follow the reefling

2050
03:38:10,900 --> 03:38:12,900
There's another boot

2051
03:38:14,020 --> 03:38:16,020
No big the lords are HP

2052
03:38:16,180 --> 03:38:18,180
We

2053
03:38:19,700 --> 03:38:23,300
Wait, you're going back haven't we already been here

2054
03:38:27,700 --> 03:38:33,780
Oh, what? Uh, this looks a little dangerous

2055
03:38:42,020 --> 03:38:45,940
Okay, how do we get back up we have to go around

2056
03:38:46,980 --> 03:38:48,980
Ah

2057
03:38:49,220 --> 03:38:52,820
Oh, that's why you went underneath because this is how to come out of it

2058
03:38:54,180 --> 03:38:59,060
It's not real there honestly. Hmm. This is clearly a lift because there's a platform and a lever

2059
03:39:00,100 --> 03:39:02,100
Why yes of

2060
03:39:06,580 --> 03:39:09,540
Okay, I'll the dwarven mains are very detailed though

2061
03:39:09,860 --> 03:39:13,300
I almost not too many believe them

2062
03:39:15,620 --> 03:39:17,620
I miss

2063
03:39:18,260 --> 03:39:20,260
She seems to stab pretty quickly

2064
03:39:20,820 --> 03:39:22,820
There's ammunition if someone wants to

2065
03:39:24,020 --> 03:39:29,540
I think those are basically all the books. I remember. Okay. That means we can have health this time

2066
03:39:29,940 --> 03:39:31,940
Maybe

2067
03:39:37,300 --> 03:39:39,940
Okay, it seems like to hit maybe I can get another

2068
03:39:40,660 --> 03:39:48,260
Oh, I never checked if I could upgrade my weapon after buying that batch like a open in that loot box batch. What's that? Okay

2069
03:39:53,140 --> 03:39:57,780
Hydrate moment. I can't believe it. I can't believe you're looking after me better than I am. Okay hydration check

2070
03:39:59,860 --> 03:40:01,860
Oh

2071
03:40:05,540 --> 03:40:08,580
There is a healing car do you guys want it more than me?

2072
03:40:12,580 --> 03:40:18,260
Our dad take it now. Okay. Let's let's not stall. Let's not stall. All right, let's go. Let's go

2073
03:40:21,220 --> 03:40:23,220
Last one is in the main car

2074
03:40:23,380 --> 03:40:31,540
How did that miss that was terrible right no one saw that I was embarrassing

2075
03:40:33,460 --> 03:40:35,460
Whoo, that's a lot

2076
03:40:36,580 --> 03:40:43,300
The names of the I like how the areas of the map all have different sections as well. It's not just like welcome to map

2077
03:40:43,460 --> 03:40:45,460
That's it

2078
03:40:47,140 --> 03:40:51,060
I may have to watch some vermin tide one gameplay because

2079
03:40:51,300 --> 03:40:53,300
I mean if this is

2080
03:40:54,580 --> 03:40:57,860
It but but just older then I don't see why

2081
03:40:58,820 --> 03:41:01,860
We couldn't be cheeky swords and try that game as well

2082
03:41:05,700 --> 03:41:11,700
Oh my goodness gentle gentle easy easy

2083
03:41:15,060 --> 03:41:17,060
Easy easy

2084
03:41:17,060 --> 03:41:19,060
Easy

2085
03:41:19,220 --> 03:41:22,580
That's a lot. That's enough slices

2086
03:41:24,900 --> 03:41:26,900
Oh my goodness

2087
03:41:27,380 --> 03:41:29,380
They don't need heels

2088
03:41:30,180 --> 03:41:34,580
They all need heels but me because I'm selfish and I keep chugging everything along the way

2089
03:41:34,580 --> 03:41:36,580
Okay

2090
03:41:42,980 --> 03:41:46,980
Don't think there's anything to go back on the original floor. Okay, right if it's one of those games

2091
03:41:46,980 --> 03:41:49,480
Or it's like well you played too. There's no much of a

2092
03:41:56,740 --> 03:42:02,100
Good, I wonder what our kd ratio is because this this is never end in fate

2093
03:42:04,580 --> 03:42:08,740
Neither reasons on the floor getting nervous when they like hold back. I'm like, am I going the wrong way?

2094
03:42:09,860 --> 03:42:12,260
Up the stairs to the right is a main for

2095
03:42:15,940 --> 03:42:18,900
In here, ah, I see

2096
03:42:21,220 --> 03:42:25,380
Okay, there's a healing draw in this main car for someone

2097
03:42:29,460 --> 03:42:31,460
They don't have it

2098
03:42:35,300 --> 03:42:39,540
Okay, there so some got here though

2099
03:42:41,380 --> 03:42:43,380
You've played too. Would you like to play

2100
03:42:44,260 --> 03:42:49,540
A wish a worst eight version worst graphics worst quality of life in a harsher grind full

2101
03:42:50,820 --> 03:42:52,820
Now when you put it like that

2102
03:42:53,060 --> 03:42:55,060
Play dark tide is dark tide a game

2103
03:42:55,860 --> 03:43:00,260
I've literally never heard of it. That sounds there. I don't mean it isn't like I've never heard this game

2104
03:43:00,260 --> 03:43:02,260
I'm not gonna bother. I mean like I just

2105
03:43:02,820 --> 03:43:05,140
Haven't heard of dark tide would be

2106
03:43:05,780 --> 03:43:08,180
Hick for something similar but different. Oh

2107
03:43:09,700 --> 03:43:11,940
God those things are like so freaking

2108
03:43:12,660 --> 03:43:15,620
Fourth coming they don't even like winding down your first

2109
03:43:16,740 --> 03:43:18,740
They start shredding you. Um

2110
03:43:19,620 --> 03:43:21,620
Mr. Mann. Yeah, you need drink

2111
03:43:22,500 --> 03:43:24,100
Oh

2112
03:43:24,100 --> 03:43:26,100
I can't even I'm literally

2113
03:43:27,060 --> 03:43:32,100
Oh, no, I'm stout grieflings. I can't do anything. You're just gonna have to come and save me

2114
03:43:32,900 --> 03:43:34,900
Hmm

2115
03:43:34,900 --> 03:43:40,900
Dark tide is like this but sitting so it's very untied but with guns. Okay. Okay. I might consider it. I might consider

2116
03:43:41,460 --> 03:43:43,460
Let him get up

2117
03:43:44,820 --> 03:43:50,180
I'll look at gameplay a vermin type one just out of curiosity and then I'll look at dark tide

2118
03:43:52,740 --> 03:43:57,300
Um when that game came out, um

2119
03:43:59,460 --> 03:44:01,460
Hell divers

2120
03:44:02,980 --> 03:44:04,980
Sorry, I need to

2121
03:44:09,620 --> 03:44:11,140
You know what

2122
03:44:11,140 --> 03:44:13,780
You know, it would be funny if I was a cheeky shit

2123
03:44:14,740 --> 03:44:17,860
I would mute the stream and two but then

2124
03:44:18,900 --> 03:44:21,380
Far down the mic to the reeflands in game

2125
03:44:22,100 --> 03:44:24,100
And no one would believe them

2126
03:44:24,740 --> 03:44:26,740
No one would believe them. Why would they?

2127
03:44:27,700 --> 03:44:32,580
Um, I don't know if the elf elf. Do you want to heal on that just so we don't leave it behind?

2128
03:44:33,620 --> 03:44:38,100
No, how we didn't they couldn't prove it. I still have your stream open. You know, yeah

2129
03:44:38,820 --> 03:44:41,300
That's fine. But what I'm saying is

2130
03:44:42,100 --> 03:44:44,100
Would anyone believe you?

2131
03:44:44,580 --> 03:44:49,060
That I muted and then farted and the make in game audio. It's not like you're recording it

2132
03:44:49,860 --> 03:44:51,860
Why would you record it?

2133
03:44:52,260 --> 03:44:57,860
Revolting could be worse. Don't me it right. Shall we take shall we go?

2134
03:44:59,620 --> 03:45:01,620
Shall we shall we shall we shall we?

2135
03:45:03,860 --> 03:45:05,860
Reach the top and don't stop

2136
03:45:06,900 --> 03:45:10,820

Oh, no way it turned around just as I was lining up the shore

2142
03:45:46,260 --> 03:45:51,300
The fiend is down. Oh, I hear him. I hear the grabby boy. The grabby boy is coming

Okay, oh hook route that's what you told

2160
03:47:48,740 --> 03:47:50,740
Even your fire

2161
03:47:57,540 --> 03:47:59,540
Okay, we did it

2162
03:48:01,300 --> 03:48:07,220
I can't believe the if he stayed up there that would have hit but that bomb was absolutely awful

2163

03:49:44,580 --> 03:49:49,540
Ooh, I picked up some ravaged art

2182
03:49:55,220 --> 03:50:00,420
Unfortunately those glows aren't healing but I'll deal with it

2183
03:50:05,460 --> 03:50:07,460
Healing

2184
03:50:09,540 --> 03:50:11,540
Another witch hunter got it nice

2185
03:50:13,060 --> 03:50:15,060
Shawnee later insane

2186
03:50:16,660 --> 03:50:20,740
I don't know why whatever like a lemon says the word dry. My mind is just like

2187
03:50:22,580 --> 03:50:24,580
Oh my god

2188
03:50:26,020 --> 03:50:27,620
Oops

2189
03:50:27,620 --> 03:50:31,860
Okay, I need to stop getting distracted. We're not playing on easy mode

2190
03:50:32,660 --> 03:50:36,980
Stop getting distracted. Oh, no. I messed that up so badly

2191
03:50:37,940 --> 03:50:39,940
Oh, no, no, no, no

2192
03:50:41,860 --> 03:50:43,860
Okay, oh

2193
03:50:47,700 --> 03:50:49,460
Okay

2194
03:50:49,460 --> 03:50:53,700
Okay, I need to try hard. I need to try hard. I can't go down the reeflings need me

2195
03:50:54,340 --> 03:50:58,020
They'll start puking down the make-and-game if I end up dying

2196
03:50:59,300 --> 03:51:04,740
I could heal myself. I don't want to be selfish though. She won't I might let you heal myself or do someone else want the skill

2197
03:51:05,300 --> 03:51:07,300
Hmm

2198
03:51:08,820 --> 03:51:11,300
If no one picks it up, I'm gonna heal myself

2199
03:51:12,580 --> 03:51:18,820
Okay, yeah, okay. I got it. Okay. Someone wants potion of concentration

2200
03:51:19,860 --> 03:51:21,860
No

2201
03:51:23,540 --> 03:51:27,860
Shawnee if I refilling without that HP, would you want to keep them to heal? Yeah

2202
03:51:28,820 --> 03:51:30,100
So I can do too much

2203
03:51:30,100 --> 03:51:34,100
But it's more valuable if the reeflings are alive than me because I don't know what I'm doing

2204
03:51:34,100 --> 03:51:36,740
I'm literally just swinging and tingling in right now

2205
03:51:39,140 --> 03:51:41,780
There's more healing at the boss boss

2206
03:51:45,620 --> 03:51:47,620
There's no more

2207
03:51:48,900 --> 03:51:50,660
In this level in particular

2208
03:51:50,660 --> 03:51:55,460
There's no more me. I don't I think I need to heal this reef one. Hold on. You don't need help

2209
03:52:01,060 --> 03:52:03,060
There we go

2210
03:52:06,500 --> 03:52:08,500
Mommy has low self esteem

2211
03:52:09,140 --> 03:52:14,020
I don't have much confidence in my video. I wouldn't say it ruins my like self esteem or anything

2212
03:52:14,340 --> 03:52:20,020
But I'm aware. I'm just not a very strong gamer. I just enjoy games though. Like I enjoy gaming have fun

2213
03:52:22,420 --> 03:52:25,860
Why am I getting a black reared? Am I missing something?

2214
03:52:26,340 --> 03:52:33,380
What happened I just lost all my HP for like nothing

2215
03:52:37,300 --> 03:52:42,660
No, if you want to go for mass insecurities, uh, you need to go for

2216
03:52:45,460 --> 03:52:46,500

I can't I don't have any insecurities and hypnosis anymore because you guys were so nice to me about

2218
03:52:51,300 --> 03:52:58,020

2219
03:52:58,900 --> 03:53:00,900

2220
03:53:01,780 --> 03:53:03,780
Like I'm not

2221
03:53:04,260 --> 03:53:07,220
Yeah, I don't have low self esteem. Like I know I'm bad at games

2222
03:53:07,540 --> 03:53:09,540
Like if I know I'm bad at something it doesn't

2223
03:53:10,180 --> 03:53:13,140
Why am I in a ditch? I literally just fell in the water

2224
03:53:14,260 --> 03:53:15,780
um

2225
03:53:15,780 --> 03:53:17,780
I don't even like insecure

2226
03:53:21,540 --> 03:53:23,540

Try to think of anything but you guys are so reassuring like I just feel good about everything

2228

Yeah

2230
03:53:39,380 --> 03:53:43,380
You guys look after me so well. I don't really have any insecurities anymore

2231
03:53:43,940 --> 03:53:45,940
Like maybe at the start of streaming. Yeah

2232
03:53:46,580 --> 03:53:51,940
Uh, but now it's just like, I don't know we're having fun. We're giving off. There's not really anything at all

2233
03:53:56,340 --> 03:53:59,620
You're loud stinky parts. Yeah, sure. I'm I'm so embarrassed about them

2234
03:54:00,420 --> 03:54:06,100
I'm gonna be honest. If it wasn't taboo, I'd be fucking farting down the mic. All I please

2235
03:54:06,820 --> 03:54:08,820
I said what I said

2236
03:54:09,700 --> 03:54:12,740
Um, but because it's taboo, I don't do it

2237
03:54:13,140 --> 03:54:15,140
I

2238
03:54:16,020 --> 03:54:18,820
Cause it's been made embarrassing. I get embarrassed

Insecurities you can secure ease knots exactly. Thank you the beauty lord, but it's truly

2241
03:54:35,300 --> 03:54:38,100
I thought that was music starting up. That sounded like the

2242
03:54:39,060 --> 03:54:41,060
Mm-hmm

2243
03:54:41,540 --> 03:54:43,540
Spirit of the sky

2244
03:54:43,620 --> 03:54:45,620
That's where I'm gonna go

2245
03:54:46,660 --> 03:54:48,660
When I die, right

2246
03:54:58,340 --> 03:55:01,540

03:56:06,420 --> 03:56:09,380
I'm no scared of this boss fight

2258

I'm terrified

2259
03:56:13,620 --> 03:56:17,380
I assume we can't hurt him. He's called the spain mangler

2260
03:56:19,220 --> 03:56:22,900
Well, we did it now. Who's got a bomber?

2261

Why are you going for me? Oh my god, he doesn't get stun locked when I do my ultimate

03:56:36,820 --> 03:56:40,180
Oh my god, he doesn't take damage

2263
03:56:48,980 --> 03:56:50,980
Oh my god, I don't know if we can do it

2264
03:56:54,500 --> 03:56:56,500
What

2265
03:56:57,620 --> 03:56:59,620
No, no, no, it's not happening

2266
03:57:00,980 --> 03:57:02,980
No, no, no, no, no

I'm fucking trying. Oh my god, wait, so I only have temporary health

2270
03:57:33,540 --> 03:57:37,060
Okay, how do I heal them?

2271
03:57:39,620 --> 03:57:42,420
Escape. Did we just run to the end before we die?

2272
03:57:48,420 --> 03:57:51,460
Oh, no, that's like the first time we've almost perished

2273
03:57:54,500 --> 03:57:56,500
Is this the way?

2274
03:58:03,780 --> 03:58:05,780
Uh, okay

2275
03:58:07,300 --> 03:58:09,300

One day I'll learn about blocking. I don't know what you're talking about

2278
03:58:18,740 --> 03:58:20,980
I don't know what the armor is. Can I upgrade my armor?

2279
03:58:23,140 --> 03:58:25,140
You know, do we? I'm not quite

2280
03:58:25,780 --> 03:58:29,300
Uh, is there a mage about to go down because of lack of heals?

2281
03:58:33,380 --> 03:58:35,380
Look see

2283
03:58:51,300 --> 03:58:54,020
I'm trying. I'm trying. I don't know. Oh, there's the stone

2284
03:58:54,980 --> 03:58:56,980
Are you gonna make it?

2285
03:58:57,140 --> 03:59:03,060
Imagine if you really needed revive just before we enter. We did it. Oh my gosh, Tisville flesh then

2286
03:59:04,180 --> 03:59:06,340
Striking back complete act two

Okay, we can still maintain veteran difficulty

2289
03:59:21,300 --> 03:59:23,780
Okay, I'm gonna unlock me lootie box

2290
03:59:24,740 --> 03:59:26,740
And then

2291
03:59:27,060 --> 03:59:29,060
I'm gonna upgrade my thing

2292
03:59:29,300 --> 03:59:32,260
And then we go for act three

2293
03:59:33,940 --> 03:59:35,940

Okay

2299
03:59:57,700 --> 04:00:00,980
One day I will not be the weakest member of the team

2300
04:00:01,780 --> 04:00:04,020
Today is still not that day

2301
04:00:04,820 --> 04:00:07,060
Did 3000 damage?

2302
04:00:11,380 --> 04:00:12,980
One two

2303
04:00:12,980 --> 04:00:18,180
Are we gonna play this again another time? I'd like to if we don't like finish the full campaign

2304
04:00:18,580 --> 04:00:24,740
I think what we'll do we'll do like is it chapter one we're doing right now chapter one acts one to four

2305
04:00:25,540 --> 04:00:27,540
and

2306
04:00:27,940 --> 04:00:29,940
And then

2307
04:00:30,820 --> 04:00:36,020
We'll come back to it another time like as I said now that I've got a steam account for stream sniping

2308
04:00:36,580 --> 04:00:40,100
You have one hour and it will be tomorrow to try and be a different day

2309
04:00:42,420 --> 04:00:44,740
It's 8 a.m. It doesn't work like that for me

2310
04:00:46,020 --> 04:00:48,020
um

2311
04:00:48,180 --> 04:00:52,980
But yeah, no, I'm definitely I'm happy with this game. I enjoy it thoroughly. I'm having a good time. I believe

2312
04:00:53,540 --> 04:00:55,540
It's not putting you to sleep so much

2313
04:00:56,580 --> 04:00:58,580
Let's do the other chapters in another stream

2314
04:01:00,180 --> 04:01:04,580
Oh, but I was gonna finish like this first this one here. Wait, hold on. Let me show you

2315
04:01:06,580 --> 04:01:08,580
Sun's going down

2316
04:01:08,740 --> 04:01:13,460
Dark deeds away. Thanks for the game. Thank you for playing. Yeah, we'll do this one

2317
04:01:13,460 --> 04:01:16,580
So we're going to finish act three and four and then that's that one done

2318
04:01:16,980 --> 04:01:22,420
And then we'll do these three together. I don't know. Do we buy the dlc or not?

2319
04:01:23,300 --> 04:01:25,300
Get out here. Jesus

2320
04:01:25,300 --> 04:01:27,300
I'm trying to give me a heart attack

2321
04:01:27,380 --> 04:01:31,620
Just wanted to see what was actually inside not fucking that

2322
04:01:33,940 --> 04:01:37,860
It's still on saturday you finished the first two chapters already. No these

2323
04:01:38,820 --> 04:01:44,900
We'll do act three and four today because that's only one two three four five

2324
04:01:45,860 --> 04:01:47,860
Five five new

2325
04:01:47,860 --> 04:01:49,380
guys

2326
04:01:49,380 --> 04:01:52,180
Mommy it says two new friends of class. Yeah, sorry

2327
04:01:52,820 --> 04:01:54,820
Right, hopefully you guys can carry me

2328
04:01:56,260 --> 04:01:58,260
Let me get you in

2329
04:02:00,660 --> 04:02:02,660
Okay

2330
04:02:03,140 --> 04:02:05,140
Who's not played

2331
04:02:06,020 --> 04:02:10,340
Uh, I don't know if the reeflings are starting to go to bed. I'm not sure

2332
04:02:11,540 --> 04:02:12,580
If you

2333
04:02:12,580 --> 04:02:17,380
You can literally just join my lobby once you accept it on my friends request list

2334
04:02:17,940 --> 04:02:19,940
singing my barber

2335
04:02:19,940 --> 04:02:21,940
and if you've not played

2336
04:02:22,180 --> 04:02:27,220
Then come join in if you have played with me not yet save the dlc for if you really enjoy the game. Okay

2337
04:02:28,260 --> 04:02:30,980
Yeah, but only hell. Yeah, only the first one to do

2338
04:02:31,860 --> 04:02:33,860
Um

2339
04:02:42,020 --> 04:02:44,020
I don't know how to say here in japanese

2340
04:02:45,380 --> 04:02:47,700
Thanks for the stream strong bond

2341
04:02:48,900 --> 04:02:53,220
Strong boom has everyone had a turn yet. I don't possibly

2342
04:02:55,380 --> 04:02:57,860
Goodbye to those who go thank you

2343
04:02:57,860 --> 04:02:59,860
Hang in

2344
04:03:04,500 --> 04:03:09,140
Wait, no, wait, that's not one there's a one one here. Thank you brain

2345
04:03:14,500 --> 04:03:18,820
Are we running out of reeflings? I think I might have successfully stream sniped all the reeflings

2346
04:03:19,300 --> 04:03:24,180
That want to play. Is there anyone in chat that hasn't played and is added but it's not happening

2347
04:03:24,980 --> 04:03:28,660
That's not had a chance. I haven't been in yet. Are you all my friends was?

2348
04:03:31,700 --> 04:03:33,700
Are you are you broke?

2349
04:03:35,620 --> 04:03:39,860
Is it not working because sometimes there's a glitch apparently just says you're on

2350
04:03:42,820 --> 04:03:46,260
Playing other games monster world, you nerd

2351
04:03:46,740 --> 04:03:53,140
It speaks to dire time. Wait, there's a warhammer three. No, no, sorry. I thought that said vermin type three

2352
04:03:53,700 --> 04:03:55,700
I misunderstood

2353
04:03:56,820 --> 04:03:58,820
It says it's full it's not

2354
04:04:00,180 --> 04:04:02,820
It can't be there's only two of us in here

2355
04:04:08,500 --> 04:04:13,700
I was trying to see your eyes. I believe you. Oh my god. You're like pirated out the weather. Oh, you have like

2356
04:04:14,260 --> 04:04:17,540
I can sign you up with a minimum of procedure and paper

2357
04:04:20,420 --> 04:04:23,620
The connections timing out check that game chat if someone's trying to join

2358
04:04:27,220 --> 04:04:29,220
No, only two have registered

2359
04:04:32,820 --> 04:04:34,820
You gotta try hell diver

2360
04:04:35,780 --> 04:04:39,060
You guys don't need to carry me in hell divers. I did play it

2361
04:04:39,700 --> 04:04:45,220
But I struggled to get into it, but I only played it when it first came out. There's only two people

2362
04:04:47,220 --> 04:04:49,220
I need to remake the lobby

2363
04:04:54,660 --> 04:05:01,380
Sometimes if you're offline invisible doesn't work. I'm not offline. I'm online. It says there's four people in my lobby. What the heck

2364
04:05:03,940 --> 04:05:06,100
How is there four people and I'm online?

2365
04:05:06,100 --> 04:05:08,100
I

2366
04:05:08,500 --> 04:05:11,620
Just to say there's four people in my lobby. There's only two

2367
04:05:13,700 --> 04:05:16,020
It's bugged. I can't join. Okay. How do I

2368
04:05:17,220 --> 04:05:20,980
Quit I mean exit to main menu. Are you sure?

2369
04:05:22,100 --> 04:05:24,100
Right, okay, we'll get the

2370
04:05:27,620 --> 04:05:29,620
Sorry

2371
04:05:32,740 --> 04:05:34,980
No, no, don't give me cut scenes

2372
04:05:35,940 --> 04:05:39,620
Okay, gazillionaire and ta'odomo you both come in

2373
04:05:41,300 --> 04:05:43,700
Because you were like already in if that makes sense

2374
04:05:48,100 --> 04:05:51,380
I feel weird about hell divers after what that sony situation

2375
04:05:52,660 --> 04:06:00,260
Yeah, and then the worst part is they made the development team take all the flak for their decisions, which I cannot stand for the life of me

2376
04:06:01,300 --> 04:06:03,700
Is that a galleon gun? Did I just unlock a galleon?

2377
04:06:04,260 --> 04:06:06,260
I think I think it is

2378
04:06:07,300 --> 04:06:09,300
What we got 50

2379
04:06:10,420 --> 04:06:15,620
Power mean fast attacks wide sweeps cloud crowd to put cloud control

2380
04:06:16,660 --> 04:06:19,700
Wait, that's only that's just a wee mallet thing

2381
04:06:20,500 --> 04:06:23,780
Yeah, I want like a big two-handed like f you equipment

2382
04:06:25,060 --> 04:06:28,820
Hold on head empty. No thoughts just the third

2383
04:06:34,660 --> 04:06:38,020
And together we will make

2384
04:06:41,540 --> 04:06:45,860
I don't know gazillionaire ta'odomo head empty. No thoughts

2385
04:06:47,540 --> 04:06:49,780
Speaking of head empty. No thoughts clearly me

2386
04:06:51,540 --> 04:06:53,540
Cloud control silver nitrates

2387
04:06:54,980 --> 04:06:56,980
Real answer this

2388
04:06:58,100 --> 04:07:00,740
Sure, I'll try whatever this is one. Oh

2389
04:07:04,660 --> 04:07:07,940
Oh, I love that. I'm here for that

2390
04:07:08,980 --> 04:07:15,700
My stamina my 28 percent push block angle. I think that actually sounds really good though

2391
04:07:16,820 --> 04:07:18,820
But time feel

2392
04:07:18,900 --> 04:07:20,900
increase the duration of potions

2393
04:07:21,700 --> 04:07:28,260
I don't even mess with potions. I hate the temporary stuff. Lucky rat skill. It's Demi's rat skill from her design

2394
04:07:28,740 --> 04:07:32,260
16 percent stamina recovery. Sure. I'll sit down

2395
04:07:33,700 --> 04:07:35,700
Strongest

2396
04:07:35,940 --> 04:07:37,940
Try holding

2397
04:07:45,380 --> 04:07:49,140
So that's what my stamina bar is this little thing with the gun

2398
04:07:53,220 --> 04:07:55,220
And just forever

2399
04:07:55,700 --> 04:07:57,700
Oh my god, ASMR

2400
04:07:58,660 --> 04:08:00,660
ASMR

2401
04:08:01,620 --> 04:08:05,940
Oh, yeah, you feel the tingles. Are you feel the tingles? However you like happen

2402
04:08:09,540 --> 04:08:12,180
We are going to play against the grain

2403
04:08:12,980 --> 04:08:18,660
Rot to blood raiding parties are cutting loose and the fields are browned us then again

2404
04:08:19,300 --> 04:08:22,660
I don't need to tell you what that means for the poor

2405
04:08:23,620 --> 04:08:24,980
That live in their path

2406
04:08:24,980 --> 04:08:31,140
You're heading to morgan's loft biggest farm in the area if there are survivors

2407
04:08:31,220 --> 04:08:35,700
And I hope there are you'll find them health captive do what you can every prisoner freed

2408
04:08:36,260 --> 04:08:39,060
Is one less slave used by the enemy and repay

2409
04:08:39,860 --> 04:08:41,860
the dead in kind

2410
04:08:42,580 --> 04:08:44,580
if you follow

2411
04:08:44,660 --> 04:08:48,820
And we pay the dead in kind if you follow

2412
04:08:49,780 --> 04:08:55,380
What does that mean? I don't know. I don't understand

2413
04:08:58,020 --> 04:09:01,780
And the trinkets lock and try equipping something with curse resistance

2414
04:09:03,860 --> 04:09:05,860
And I don't have anything

2415
04:09:08,980 --> 04:09:10,980
I'm too much of a baby

2416
04:09:14,180 --> 04:09:16,180
Level

2417
04:09:19,060 --> 04:09:24,100
In we go take one of them out for everyone they took out

2418
04:09:26,660 --> 04:09:28,660
She actually has a denial

2419
04:09:31,940 --> 04:09:37,780
Where did that come from am I being dumb? I don't need to tell you what that means for the poor bastards in their path

2420
04:09:38,260 --> 04:09:41,540
You're heading to morgan's loft shoot while holding the right click

2421
04:09:42,180 --> 04:09:45,620
If there are survivors, oh hold right click and then shoot the gun. Oh

2422
04:09:46,500 --> 04:09:50,260
You read the gun up in the fire. Oh, I thought you were showing me that I could wind it up. Sorry

2423
04:09:56,100 --> 04:09:58,100
Oh, I just realized

2424
04:10:03,220 --> 04:10:08,180
Maybe I should be the elf if I like the fire we should he make to eat in the background

2425
04:10:08,980 --> 04:10:10,980
I'm read love the gun in the fire

2426
04:10:15,620 --> 04:10:17,620
I

2427
04:10:24,420 --> 04:10:26,420
Didn't pretend to be scarecrows

2428
04:10:28,500 --> 04:10:30,500
Oh my god, I love this

2429
04:10:31,860 --> 04:10:34,740
Okay, maybe I should be a gun specialist

2430
04:10:35,700 --> 04:10:41,540
Hold on a minute that that 40 key warhammer game doesn't sound so bad now that I'm playing with guns

2431
04:10:42,420 --> 04:10:44,420
Hold on a minute

2432
04:10:44,500 --> 04:10:46,500
Maybe we'll be getting that one in

2433
04:10:47,300 --> 04:10:49,300
Not instead as well as

2434
04:10:50,740 --> 04:10:52,740
That's fun. I like that

2435
04:10:53,380 --> 04:10:56,260
Oh my god, is there a little farm head together?

2436
04:10:57,380 --> 04:10:59,380
Oh

2437
04:11:03,620 --> 04:11:05,620
Okay, let's go

2438
04:11:09,780 --> 04:11:11,780
Swing swing swing

2439
04:11:15,220 --> 04:11:20,580
Are you proud of me? I use bloke for the first time. I didn't even know there were more of them

2440
04:11:24,260 --> 04:11:28,340
No, no, no, no leave me fling alone stop it. Are you alive?

2441
04:11:38,260 --> 04:11:40,260
I'd rather just swing on the wee one

2442
04:11:41,140 --> 04:11:48,500
I'm proud of my streamer. I'm did it. I blocked I'm sometimes walking

2443
04:11:52,420 --> 04:11:54,420
Something's dribbling

2444
04:11:58,660 --> 04:12:00,660
I'm swinging

2445
04:12:01,460 --> 04:12:03,460
The little pickaxe that then

2446
04:12:03,620 --> 04:12:05,140
Wait, hold on

2447
04:12:05,140 --> 04:12:08,900
Is my heavy attack a big sweep or is I like that? What's this?

2448
04:12:09,620 --> 04:12:11,620
A bomb bar

2449
04:12:16,500 --> 04:12:20,180
Uh, uh, you need it more than I do. How do I give the healing drop to the elf?

2450
04:12:22,180 --> 04:12:25,060
The elf requires a healing drop. Where's that? How do I give it to you?

2451
04:12:30,740 --> 04:12:32,740
We've done the wrong way

2452
04:12:33,860 --> 04:12:36,260
Uh, oh no, we just claim over

2453
04:12:39,700 --> 04:12:45,140
Ha, ha, sorry. I had to stand on them now that I'm using the block. Can't let them know

2454
04:12:46,020 --> 04:12:48,020
Can't go go let them hook up

2455
04:12:52,500 --> 04:12:56,420
It only took me what four hours to learn how to block properly

2456
04:12:58,420 --> 04:13:03,620
Oh my god, absolutely just raking and dakin

2457
04:13:05,940 --> 04:13:07,940
You mean I could have blocked from the start

2458
04:13:08,900 --> 04:13:10,900
I mean

2459
04:13:19,060 --> 04:13:21,060
Oh wait his armor protects them

2460
04:13:24,500 --> 04:13:26,500
Oh, I do thoroughly enjoy

2461
04:13:27,620 --> 04:13:28,900
Hey

2462
04:13:28,900 --> 04:13:30,420
That gun

2463
04:13:30,420 --> 04:13:32,420
Thoroughly enjoy that bad boy

2464
04:13:34,660 --> 04:13:37,140
You can push by attacking while blocking

2465
04:13:37,140 --> 04:13:41,140
Mm-hmm. Oh dear. I believe they've killed the townspeople

2466
04:13:42,740 --> 04:13:48,260
Strangely, I say this unironically. There are folk that get up to legendary difficulty without ever learning a block properly

2467
04:13:48,820 --> 04:13:50,820
Honestly me if we kept going

2468
04:13:52,340 --> 04:13:57,220
I'm wondering if we could test out a difficulty like ramp it up

2469
04:13:57,620 --> 04:14:04,100
And only my best warrior reeflings are allowed to show up and we'll see if we can we won't do any of the tomes though

2470
04:14:04,180 --> 04:14:06,180
I don't want any tome problems

2471
04:14:08,100 --> 04:14:10,100
Oh

2472
04:14:10,820 --> 04:14:12,820
Wow, I love this

2473
04:14:18,980 --> 04:14:26,420
Okay, I don't know where the poison one is but I have to admit this is mighty satisfying this gun

2474
04:14:29,060 --> 04:14:32,180
Wow, wow, I'm loving this

2475
04:14:32,180 --> 04:14:34,180
Oh

2476
04:14:35,620 --> 04:14:40,660
Next you need to learn how to dodge. Oh god. What is it left jump?

2477
04:14:45,300 --> 04:14:47,300
Assassin

2478
04:14:50,020 --> 04:14:55,380
Oh, did you see that embo right on his freaking head? Oh, there's a healing if someone needs it

2479
04:14:56,340 --> 04:15:01,380
Hmm, I'll take the med kit so I can heal someone manually and then someone can take the potions

2480
04:15:02,500 --> 04:15:04,500
There's a potion back there

2481
04:15:06,340 --> 04:15:13,620
How are you liking vermin tide any possible dark to you awesome saying a dark date check her pc. She's bought

2482
04:15:15,060 --> 04:15:17,460
How dare you these are my me fling

2483
04:15:18,340 --> 04:15:23,300
Yeah, we're in the game with me earlier. What are you talking about bought and I can't be bought in

2484
04:15:24,260 --> 04:15:27,060
The religion doesn't even match together

2485
04:15:29,300 --> 04:15:32,660
And if the game literally is like this

2486
04:15:33,620 --> 04:15:38,820
Like dark tide but with guns. I'm gonna watch some gameplay of dark tides

2487
04:15:40,740 --> 04:15:45,860
Because I'm loving this gun. I didn't realize you had like such a variety on the weaponry

2488
04:15:48,260 --> 04:15:50,580
I'm very nice very satisfying

2489
04:15:53,460 --> 04:15:59,460
It's far more gun focused. It's adorable how you love healing us wait until we play over watch if you like me

2490
04:16:10,100 --> 04:16:14,900
Though the horns are scary because I know that means like it's gonna be bad

2491
04:16:18,500 --> 04:16:22,660
They're good at doing like the music tension like the string kind of island

2492
04:16:24,020 --> 04:16:26,740
Type bill there's enemies approaching type stuff

2493
04:16:29,300 --> 04:16:34,660
Uh, it's so satisfying when like all four of us come together and just like swipe swipe swipe

2494
04:16:35,540 --> 04:16:38,500
They can't even get a hit in because of how much we're decimating them

2495
04:16:44,180 --> 04:16:48,020
I'm wondering if I actually aimed it would do anything different, but I don't think so

2496
04:16:48,900 --> 04:16:50,900
Oh

2497
04:16:52,020 --> 04:16:56,180
I had to I had to I had to give him the false impression that he could swing on man

2498
04:16:59,460 --> 04:17:01,460
There's an enemy inside

2499
04:17:11,300 --> 04:17:13,300
There's an enemy there's a mage

2500
04:17:15,380 --> 04:17:17,380
Oh

2501
04:17:18,980 --> 04:17:20,980
What

2502
04:17:22,020 --> 04:17:26,900
There's a mage doing something but we're not interested. Sorry don't come to the door

2503
04:17:27,780 --> 04:17:29,780
Is this a dead end? No

2504
04:17:30,260 --> 04:17:33,940
Oh, it is a dead end. I thought we were climbing through that hole you can fit in it

2505
04:17:34,660 --> 04:17:36,660
Can't you dwarf?

2506
04:17:38,820 --> 04:17:41,300
Uh, right so that was a dead end that's okay

2507
04:17:42,100 --> 04:17:50,100
Dark tide is fun, but you have a preference for vermin tide. You can bomb the end of the barrel to open it. Oh

2508
04:17:51,940 --> 04:17:53,940
Oh, did we mess up the barrel by accident?

2509
04:17:55,540 --> 04:17:57,540
Was there a secret that way?

2510
04:17:59,060 --> 04:18:01,060
And we got a bit too excited

2511
04:18:03,220 --> 04:18:05,220
Oh, he can take three hits

2512
04:18:12,020 --> 04:18:14,020
Hmm what

2513
04:18:14,980 --> 04:18:16,980
No, I'll loot that. Why not?

2514
04:18:18,100 --> 04:18:20,100
I've got a key

2515
04:18:22,900 --> 04:18:24,900
Oh

2516
04:18:25,220 --> 04:18:27,220
Uh, would you like

2517
04:18:29,540 --> 04:18:34,980
That sorry it took me so long to register something bad was happening there. I was like, yes. Yes

2518
04:18:35,940 --> 04:18:41,460
What am I doing? Unlock and go through the barn. Okay to the barn to the window

2519
04:18:42,660 --> 04:18:44,660
to the barn

2520
04:18:44,660 --> 04:18:46,660
so the heads fall off the

2521
04:18:47,300 --> 04:18:48,660
vermin tide

2522
04:18:48,660 --> 04:18:53,380
Is that the name of the enemies or just like this section of the world?

2523
04:18:55,220 --> 04:18:57,220
Let me in knock knock

2524
04:18:57,620 --> 04:18:59,620
Knock I

2525
04:19:06,340 --> 04:19:08,180
Am

2526
04:19:08,180 --> 04:19:10,580
I don't know why my gamer senses weren't tingling

2527
04:19:10,580 --> 04:19:14,820
There that was probably the most obvious thing because like why did the doors not open right away?

2528
04:19:16,180 --> 04:19:18,180
I'm trying

2529
04:19:18,660 --> 04:19:20,660
I'm trying I'm taking agricultural. I'm about

2530
04:19:23,140 --> 04:19:25,140
Oh

2531
04:19:25,140 --> 04:19:27,140
Oh my goodness

2532
04:19:28,180 --> 04:19:33,800
Okay, who needs heels the most I think I might now actually need heels for

2533
04:19:34,860 --> 04:19:36,860
I'm being selfish. I'm sorry

2534
04:19:37,740 --> 04:19:43,040
Go on without me. I've disgraced you from my gameplay. The rats are called Gavin

2535
04:19:44,100 --> 04:19:49,060
Vermintaid is like an army of the Ratman. Okay, we will destroy the Vermintaid

2536
04:19:50,340 --> 04:19:54,900
The army we would we will destroy the army. We will destroy the Vermintaid

2537
04:19:55,140 --> 04:19:58,580
We will destroy. Yeah, it can't be. Ah, that doesn't make sense

2538
04:20:01,740 --> 04:20:06,020
Claiming the letter claimy claim. It's pronounced gave in

2539
04:20:08,580 --> 04:20:10,580
Yeah, they're all hanging

2540
04:20:17,260 --> 04:20:19,260
That's your ultimate

2541
04:20:19,620 --> 04:20:22,620
I'm just falling. Oh, there's a bookie

2542
04:20:23,620 --> 04:20:28,620
He got it home. A Vermintaid is what happens when the scaven don't back stab each other for a week

2543
04:20:28,660 --> 04:20:31,660
You mean they actually learn to cooperate and now they may

2544
04:20:33,020 --> 04:20:35,020
Oh my Vamo, I can't shoot them

2545
04:20:37,060 --> 04:20:39,220
Okay, that was good cuz I literally was over

2546
04:20:44,460 --> 04:20:46,460
Me fly

2547
04:20:49,780 --> 04:20:51,780
Reload smooth

2548
04:20:53,620 --> 04:20:55,620
I

2549
04:20:55,900 --> 04:20:59,620
Can't I don't I don't even know how to ping in this game. I don't think they have a ping system

2550
04:21:00,780 --> 04:21:05,820
Vermintaid is their world for the apocalypse season of vermin maxing. Okay

2551
04:21:06,380 --> 04:21:12,060
It should be the main one getting healed as you skills, which you should use more gives temp health

2552
04:21:12,060 --> 04:21:15,780
I think I'm so low level. I'm not at that bit yet

2553
04:21:23,380 --> 04:21:25,380
They're so dramatic I

2554
04:21:26,180 --> 04:21:31,940
Like how they're just hanging out. They're like, yeah, I was on patrol yesterday. The boss didn't give me a raise

2555
04:21:38,140 --> 04:21:43,980
Oh my god, I like slicing them in half rather satisfying when limbs and heads start

2556
04:21:45,980 --> 04:21:47,980
Your all gives you and everyone else

2557
04:21:53,100 --> 04:21:55,100
I don't know the music

2558
04:22:04,620 --> 04:22:06,620
But I don't think

2559
04:22:07,580 --> 04:22:12,020
Spooky scary vermin tape with all the rest of plunder

2560
04:22:12,020 --> 04:22:15,180
I don't know the lore, but I don't have to know

2561
04:22:15,740 --> 04:22:19,460
As you feel there's so soon a pom-pom spooky

2562
04:22:20,420 --> 04:22:28,580
I'm swinging hard as I can. I'm using my ultimate to gain temporary HP

2563
04:22:31,540 --> 04:22:34,460
I'm trying I can't do that the same time it's like picking up

2564
04:22:36,740 --> 04:22:38,740
What happens when he sucks me

2565
04:22:40,020 --> 04:22:43,780
No leave my replaying alone don't do that again

2566
04:22:43,780 --> 04:22:45,780
I

2567
04:22:48,820 --> 04:22:52,260
Don't have any I still don't have any munitions does anyone have anything

2568
04:22:54,260 --> 04:23:00,540
Okay, right we do have some ammunition at least as I'm really listening to any song exit. I got you

2569
04:23:01,420 --> 04:23:03,420
I'll start singing Mary season

2570
04:23:05,980 --> 04:23:07,980
I won't you

2571
04:23:14,780 --> 04:23:18,820
I was a really difficult song for her to sing that was probably

2572
04:23:20,300 --> 04:23:27,260
If I had to rank all the songs for the difficulty levels Mercy got the most difficult assigned to her

2573
04:23:30,220 --> 04:23:32,220
Defo-defo-defo

2574
04:23:36,260 --> 04:23:41,860
Me I was just shitposting so I don't count. Oh, look at that dodge. Oh

2575
04:23:42,340 --> 04:23:48,480
Oh my god, this reference so good. Oh, you're blocked. Oh

2576
04:23:51,860 --> 04:23:55,220
My gosh, that's all them schmooze

2577
04:23:56,860 --> 04:24:00,340
Johnny that was ammo behind you. Well, I am special needs

2578
04:24:01,060 --> 04:24:03,060
I

2579
04:24:05,900 --> 04:24:11,740
Strongly if you ever have a moment I'd strongly recommend listening to the doom of carbs our short story

2580
04:24:11,900 --> 04:24:13,900
Is that a warhammer story?

2581
04:24:14,380 --> 04:24:22,020
Do people is it like okay? This is gonna sound really bad, but in the scp world and people can

2582
04:24:23,620 --> 04:24:28,140
I'm suck so badly. I suck so badly. I'm so sorry

2583
04:24:28,140 --> 04:24:32,060
Um, I'm so sorry again just whacked it

2584
04:24:34,380 --> 04:24:36,380
And

2585
04:24:36,540 --> 04:24:43,980
The NACP people can like voice stories about the world is like warhammer like that. That was that is thank you

2586
04:24:45,100 --> 04:24:47,300
Craig guardsman

2587
04:24:53,180 --> 04:24:55,960
Push attack on great stars. I'm gonna

2588
04:24:58,420 --> 04:25:02,540
Breaks their poise as well. Take that. That's what I think about your poise. Oh

2589
04:25:04,580 --> 04:25:06,580
I don't like that

2590
04:25:07,580 --> 04:25:09,580
Free all the prisoners

2591
04:25:18,180 --> 04:25:20,180
I'm trying

2592
04:25:22,300 --> 04:25:25,580
Yeah, the more hammer fan base has tons of folks that do that kind of content

2593
04:25:25,780 --> 04:25:31,220
Okay, okay, okay, I understand it. I'm learning more and learning more so people can like also do there. Please let me in. Oh

2594
04:25:32,100 --> 04:25:38,140
What are we doing in here? Are we having a moment? No, are we not supposed to be in here? Oh

2595
04:25:39,340 --> 04:25:43,220
Okay, okay, we were just taking a moment to recover that's all

2596
04:25:47,940 --> 04:25:54,440
Hold your attack while blocking it said downward it does a downward slash

2597
04:25:56,100 --> 04:25:58,100
Yes, I see it

2598
04:26:02,460 --> 04:26:04,460
We're definitely low on heels

2599
04:26:08,540 --> 04:26:10,540
I

2600
04:26:14,700 --> 04:26:16,700
Don't like this

2601
04:26:18,580 --> 04:26:23,620
And just hope they can save back far enough some left on my own devices

2602
04:26:24,300 --> 04:26:29,340
Did any writer on lyrics for the song? I've never heard of that version. No, I'm

2603
04:26:31,540 --> 04:26:35,060
Gotta only know her current performance name. She's uh, um

2604
04:26:38,180 --> 04:26:45,100
Since hour since hour was the both AC and me covered a sins song

2605
04:26:45,980 --> 04:26:47,980
and

2606
04:26:48,740 --> 04:26:56,460
What I tried to do was cover a popular song that was similar to the theme of the girl so

2607
04:26:57,220 --> 04:27:02,580
And Amy did a song about pumpkins because she's a little pumpkin if you haven't figured it out yet

2608
04:27:02,580 --> 04:27:05,340
She has a voodoo doll, but she's also an adorable little pumpkin

2609
04:27:05,860 --> 04:27:10,220
And I see as a polar bear and she's totally not a furry

2610
04:27:10,220 --> 04:27:14,380
So she did a song cover that's called like him for that furry ship

2611
04:27:16,100 --> 04:27:24,380
Mersey did why won't you notice me senpai because she's a yandere she be did doing your mum because she's like a milf and

2612
04:27:25,540 --> 04:27:33,100
Azura did boobs in the thumbnail just because she has absolute fucking massive honkers really and then I did

2613
04:27:33,100 --> 04:27:39,740
I'm just a memer but like obviously I could kind of choose it's not like there's a popular song about cuttlefish out there

2614
04:27:39,740 --> 04:27:44,660
That's like really well-known and mean if I so I tried to make them related to the girls because most

2615
04:27:46,100 --> 04:27:51,420
Agencies like they want like a super try hard song and you know

2616
04:27:51,580 --> 04:27:56,380
Maybe like a Japanese cover of a really popular song type thing and it's like just

2617
04:27:57,900 --> 04:28:01,200
Just some you know if the girls want to do any other song covers that's fine

2618
04:28:01,200 --> 04:28:05,500
But that's what I asked them to do for debut and if anyone wants to go further. They're more than welcome to it

2619
04:28:05,500 --> 04:28:09,540
It's not a problem an issue anything like of that need. I'm so down here. I'm so dead

2620
04:28:09,900 --> 04:28:11,900
I

2621
04:28:13,300 --> 04:28:15,300
Give everyone that temporary HP

2622
04:28:16,140 --> 04:28:19,620
No, I'm getting I'm not gonna survive this little thing. I

2623
04:28:21,060 --> 04:28:23,060
Don't think I'm

2624
04:28:28,140 --> 04:28:31,900
Gives up it's probably better every fling has at the me because I have self-heals

2625
04:28:33,660 --> 04:28:37,460
Yeah, you guys take the healing because I have my temp stuff as well

2626
04:28:38,220 --> 04:28:41,460
So I can constantly pick myself up with that rubbish

2627
04:28:43,460 --> 04:28:45,460
That I heal

2628
04:28:46,820 --> 04:28:48,820
As there is close to ten thousand

2629
04:28:50,380 --> 04:28:54,500
Everyone and then I can release the artwork. I'm so excited for you all to see it

2630
04:28:54,500 --> 04:28:57,740
I want to see everyone's reaction to it in the comments on Twitter

2631
04:29:00,140 --> 04:29:06,140
There's a cost a pretty penny and it was kind of like a start of course that I didn't have to do

2632
04:29:06,140 --> 04:29:09,340
But I wanted to do it because I wanted to see us all together and it's very cute

2633
04:29:10,460 --> 04:29:12,580
Those are human. Sorry. Those are humans

2634
04:29:15,300 --> 04:29:19,300
Every fun war I've also had to the old world war

2635
04:29:20,620 --> 04:29:25,060
They have this thing the cancel of 13 and the one seat is left empty for their god

2636
04:29:25,060 --> 04:29:31,740
Oh, I like that kind of stuff where they have like symbolism and all that. Oh my god. Are you okay?

2637
04:29:36,900 --> 04:29:38,900
I

2638
04:29:39,340 --> 04:29:41,340
Was he not dead?

2639
04:29:42,300 --> 04:29:45,700
He's just fucking going apeshit in there. Oh

2640
04:29:47,020 --> 04:29:49,020
My god, are you?

2641
04:29:49,940 --> 04:29:51,940
How I

2642
04:29:55,060 --> 04:30:01,700
Just got absolutely mental he was a whirlwind and world-winding through that

2643
04:30:02,540 --> 04:30:05,540
I'm trying to like catch the ones that get stuck behind us

2644
04:30:15,140 --> 04:30:17,140
You stop that

2645
04:30:18,500 --> 04:30:23,500
God they keep coming. Oh, it's the end of the map. Sorry. I'm holding this up. Sorry. It's the end of the map

2646
04:30:25,220 --> 04:30:27,220
Wayward stone wayward stone

2647
04:30:31,860 --> 04:30:33,860
And I shoot from in here

2648
04:30:36,140 --> 04:30:38,140
Are we in

2649
04:30:42,180 --> 04:30:45,500
Return me to the soil as opposed to what the strats we are darling

2650
04:30:50,180 --> 04:30:53,980
He's a slayer his whole thing is going apeshit berserker to war honestly

2651
04:30:53,980 --> 04:30:59,620
I just turned around and look at the the pathway out of the barn and there's like 50 surrounding

2652
04:30:59,620 --> 04:31:01,620
I'm just whirlwind and through them

2653
04:31:01,900 --> 04:31:08,140
We did it because I didn't name the team. I'm struggling to name teams now. I'm being so dumb

2654
04:31:09,580 --> 04:31:13,420
Asking not to be cremated. I don't know what to name the

2655
04:31:15,260 --> 04:31:17,260
What do we do?

2656
04:31:17,580 --> 04:31:19,580
What do we do?

2657
04:31:21,660 --> 04:31:25,300
That was how don't move okay, I'll say don't go

2658
04:31:26,300 --> 04:31:28,980
And then the answer is

2659
04:31:29,700 --> 04:31:35,060
I'll put doko equals cocoa because you can't ask me where I am when I'm here every day

2660
04:31:35,820 --> 04:31:37,820
every day

2661
04:31:38,340 --> 04:31:40,340
I got an accolade

2662
04:31:41,380 --> 04:31:48,900
Look I got saved. I have to boot any move myself at the way, but look I got saved. I

2663
04:31:49,260 --> 04:31:53,780
Have an accolade one save. I did it. I'm the healer

2664
04:31:54,780 --> 04:31:56,780
I'm doing all

2665
04:32:00,980 --> 04:32:08,180
While many people do narrate the stories unlike SCP the whole Warhammer universe isn't public domain

2666
04:32:08,460 --> 04:32:11,540
So performance rights aren't necessarily guaranteed

2667
04:32:12,180 --> 04:32:17,100
Also, hooray for stroneys horde shoot a rock. We'll have her on deep rock before long

2668
04:32:19,180 --> 04:32:21,180
Deep rock galactica has guns

2669
04:32:21,420 --> 04:32:23,420
Thank you

2670
04:32:26,900 --> 04:32:28,900
Thank you for playing

2671
04:32:29,700 --> 04:32:32,460
How many mission I don't think we have hardly any mission

2672
04:32:35,100 --> 04:32:39,540
I know you're trying to be curious and say thank you. Thanks mom. Thanks

2673
04:32:40,780 --> 04:32:43,780
What are we go? I think we're like hardly anything left

2674
04:32:44,980 --> 04:32:50,260
Empire and flames. We've got one two three four maps left and then we're done

2675
04:32:50,620 --> 04:32:52,300
We have done

2676
04:32:52,300 --> 04:32:54,300
Part two one. Okay

2677
04:32:55,220 --> 04:32:58,420
Is there any refling he would like to play that hasn't been able to play?

2678
04:33:03,820 --> 04:33:09,220
Who's the next bunch of refling let's find it I'd play deep rock any day

2679
04:33:09,660 --> 04:33:13,020
There is a means of Moria game that we could play together

2680
04:33:13,340 --> 04:33:18,020
I was gonna try and find Veeja Bruce to the but I think we'd get to bored of it cuz it's Lord of the Rings

2681
04:33:19,020 --> 04:33:24,380
And I'll fill up with it cuz it's Lord of the Rings even though I think the mechanics weren't that good or something

2682
04:33:24,380 --> 04:33:29,380
I can't remember what the feedback was on that game, but it's like mechanics are a bit okay

2683
04:33:30,660 --> 04:33:32,740
I've played already so I'll wait until we know

2684
04:33:33,740 --> 04:33:35,740
Anybody else who hasn't gone yet

2685
04:33:36,180 --> 04:33:40,500
Speak now in the YouTube chat or forever hold your peace. Okay

2686
04:33:40,940 --> 04:33:47,460
How does one join so you can add me on steam because I have a streamsnaping steam account called

2687
04:33:47,620 --> 04:33:52,900
Strony snakes and if you have vermin take two don't buy it just to play with me because I'm really sure the game and

2688
04:33:54,300 --> 04:33:59,740
Just as a disclaimer and but it means we can play streamsnap games together and I

2689
04:34:00,500 --> 04:34:02,500
Wait to since I did

2690
04:34:04,380 --> 04:34:07,380
Yeah, I still haven't gone in but it's looking like my connections when I love it

2691
04:34:10,940 --> 04:34:15,140
Join your game, haha, no, I can get you in my game

2692
04:34:24,540 --> 04:34:30,740
I'm going to buy it so I can play with you next time buying four copies. No, that's not how you're supposed to do

2693
04:34:31,260 --> 04:34:35,140
The Lord of the Ring games with Dorf was like a survival gathering game, but had fun parts

2694
04:34:36,060 --> 04:34:38,060
Yeah, I think it was like

2695
04:34:38,660 --> 04:34:44,740
When a dwarf disgraces themselves so bad they have to go into exile they become a slayer

2696
04:34:44,980 --> 04:34:50,820
They swear off armor and turn their hair into orange mohawks. Oh, they're not killing shit

2697
04:34:50,820 --> 04:34:53,940
They're depressed about not being dead yet and drinking

2698
04:34:54,660 --> 04:34:56,660
That's a very

2699
04:34:57,180 --> 04:34:59,180
specifically I

2700
04:35:00,580 --> 04:35:03,500
Think we ran out I forgot to install the game on you

2701
04:35:03,500 --> 04:35:07,780
Oh, okay, peppermint you've not played have you?

2702
04:35:11,940 --> 04:35:13,940
Bro

2703
04:35:20,900 --> 04:35:22,900
Gotta eat copies

2704
04:35:24,900 --> 04:35:28,740
You gotta buy double-digit amount of copies of nice anything else

2705
04:35:33,940 --> 04:35:35,940
Oh

2706
04:35:42,940 --> 04:35:47,660
No one has a claim to the game that everyone's played that wants to pay

2707
04:35:49,580 --> 04:35:51,580
Then

2708
04:35:54,580 --> 04:35:57,900
Did she say I had to buy it to all the reasons stop it

2709
04:35:58,740 --> 04:35:59,980
to

2710
04:35:59,980 --> 04:36:05,140
What getting 10 copies of vermin tide 10 of dark tide are we running it back with old reasons?

2711
04:36:05,140 --> 04:36:05,820
I

2712
04:36:05,820 --> 04:36:11,220
Unless someone wants to make a claim that they're trying to get in doctor. No shame. Thank you for coming to memba

2713
04:36:11,940 --> 04:36:16,700
I appreciate it. Is anyone claiming that they've not had a shot yet and

2714
04:36:17,460 --> 04:36:19,780
They want in but they can't get in or something

2715
04:36:20,860 --> 04:36:25,780
As everyone added me that can add me I'm called Stony Snipes and I'm on Berman tide

2716
04:36:26,620 --> 04:36:37,420
No one's claiming so I guess any reefing that would like to flee I claim to have a shot but no environment

2717
04:36:38,420 --> 04:36:43,420
Can't wait for the strong and call sponsored vermin time to string into your arms. I'm really enjoying this

2718
04:36:43,420 --> 04:36:46,660
I think I might force you to play overwatch with me

2719
04:36:48,460 --> 04:36:50,460
Okay peppermint

2720
04:36:51,580 --> 04:36:54,180
Is it lit and okay stash

2721
04:36:55,780 --> 04:36:57,780
power and

2722
04:36:58,260 --> 04:37:00,260
Then have fun

2723
04:37:01,060 --> 04:37:07,300
Have fun and have fun like my clothes. Damn. I was too slow. I can't in the moment. I'm cooking dinner

2724
04:37:09,860 --> 04:37:11,860
And there's four of four

2725
04:37:14,300 --> 04:37:17,580
Glacier alright, this is team. Glacier. Oh my god

2726
04:37:18,460 --> 04:37:23,220
Glacier the way to spell that way like it team. Glacier. All right

2727
04:37:24,220 --> 04:37:30,340
I'll get an exit. Yes. Oh my god, your skin is actually rather terrifying

2728
04:37:33,220 --> 04:37:41,260
The fire is burning you alive in there seems like an old mate of mine has been whispering in balthas are guilty

2729
04:37:43,220 --> 04:37:45,220
Emporium of wonders. Oh

2730
04:37:45,380 --> 04:37:46,500
Oh

2731
04:37:46,500 --> 04:37:48,260
Kill yourself

2732
04:37:48,260 --> 04:37:49,980
Sorry, that was a bit dramatic

2733
04:37:49,980 --> 04:37:56,860
I kind of be arsed when games do that when they put something in it looks like something you should interact with and then the games like

2734
04:37:59,740 --> 04:38:05,540
Party does not meet the requirement. Okay, we're going back down to recruit. Thank the fucking maker. I can go back down to recruit and

2735
04:38:06,220 --> 04:38:08,220
Minecraft and

2736
04:38:08,220 --> 04:38:09,620
So you buy cosmetics

2737
04:38:09,620 --> 04:38:12,540
That's what I'm saying. Look if you take this room into consideration

2738
04:38:13,060 --> 04:38:18,420
If you look around the room what sticks out most do you if you ignore what they've actually outlined

2739
04:38:18,500 --> 04:38:23,740
It's like oh the pay the pay stuff is the most highlighted and it's like so well then what's this?

2740
04:38:23,740 --> 04:38:28,300
I don't even know what this is to be honest. I'll figure out later do but you know

2741
04:38:28,820 --> 04:38:32,020
You can make custom lobbies and overwatch so both any man friends

2742
04:38:33,460 --> 04:38:38,940
Fun fact they added that to the game years after release. Okay. Maybe it's not as bad as I once thought

2743
04:38:39,940 --> 04:38:41,940
Oh

2744
04:38:42,260 --> 04:38:46,820
Thank you origin for the tip and quest as well

2745
04:38:46,820 --> 04:38:48,660
I

2746
04:38:48,660 --> 04:38:53,540
Would like to remind you guys you can't say things for free and

2747
04:38:54,020 --> 04:38:56,020
Okay

2748
04:39:08,220 --> 04:39:10,220
Yeah, you heard me

2749
04:39:11,620 --> 04:39:16,180
Right, we only have like four missions to go and we're done though ready

2750
04:39:16,180 --> 04:39:20,580
I'm gonna be extra cocky this game because I know we're on the easy

2751
04:39:21,380 --> 04:39:25,020
And there's gonna be health everywhere I get to be a healer

2752
04:39:29,020 --> 04:39:35,940
Shark fish games can sometimes be greedy dark titan example for the PC players. That's all the gammy wait. What does that say?

2753
04:39:37,540 --> 04:39:41,020
Us an elm heart, okay

2754
04:39:44,380 --> 04:39:46,900
Really broly legend a really

2755
04:39:47,340 --> 04:39:49,340
Really

2756
04:39:49,740 --> 04:39:51,860
Reminder that super chats are free for now

2757
04:39:52,980 --> 04:39:55,860
No, what that that's not free if you charge yourself

2758
04:39:56,660 --> 04:39:59,220
You know, I'm starting to think you guys are in a fin dome

2759
04:39:59,900 --> 04:40:03,260
Cuz it's something going on here something's no cotton. I

2760
04:40:04,420 --> 04:40:06,700
Hear the enemies, but I don't see the enemies

2761
04:40:06,700 --> 04:40:08,700
A

2762
04:40:14,380 --> 04:40:20,820
Wide ber a wide ber under the development team. I really like the way they speak in this game

2763
04:40:23,180 --> 04:40:28,660
You just realized hypno fendom the worst combo

2764
04:40:30,060 --> 04:40:32,060
What combo is worse?

2765
04:40:33,100 --> 04:40:35,100
Hypno

2766
04:40:35,420 --> 04:40:37,420
Specification or

2767
04:40:39,860 --> 04:40:41,860
Mobile that isn't even a message

2768
04:40:45,780 --> 04:40:47,780
Now I don't mind

2769
04:40:48,620 --> 04:40:50,620
Specification, I don't mind it

2770
04:40:50,820 --> 04:40:54,620
But some of the stuff I've seen on it is so fucking predatory

2771
04:40:56,100 --> 04:40:58,260
And it's like fucking with people I

2772
04:40:58,860 --> 04:41:00,860
I

2773
04:41:01,220 --> 04:41:07,980
Like that the enemies that are highlighted that they're actually sorry, I just tried to beat them up with a potion

2774
04:41:09,780 --> 04:41:11,780
Both are equal

2775
04:41:11,780 --> 04:41:14,540
I don't mind it like I would give it a fucking shot

2776
04:41:14,540 --> 04:41:21,020
I don't mind it and but this stuff that I consumed like I consumed a lot of hypno content at one point

2777
04:41:21,220 --> 04:41:27,460
to see what other people were making and what I would enjoy making my version of or my

2778
04:41:28,260 --> 04:41:29,900
thing of

2779
04:41:29,900 --> 04:41:31,900
Oh my god

2780
04:41:31,900 --> 04:41:35,420
So much is like fucking with the mind of the person. I'm like

2781
04:41:36,500 --> 04:41:39,900
So when I say I like to mind break you

2782
04:41:40,660 --> 04:41:43,740
What I mean when I say that is I think

2783
04:41:44,460 --> 04:41:52,020
Personally it would be H word if you were like if you tried to fire work to someone else

2784
04:41:52,020 --> 04:41:57,100
But it wasn't as satisfying because it wasn't me now obviously that's gonna wear off

2785
04:41:57,100 --> 04:42:01,220
That's not like a permanent actual mind break thing, you know

2786
04:42:03,260 --> 04:42:10,860
But some of the stuff I consumed I was like, oh my god, you need to be locked up like what the fuck some of the stuff was like

2787
04:42:12,860 --> 04:42:15,740
Fucking with like gender identification and I'm like no

2788
04:42:20,340 --> 04:42:24,140
It's just me for some of it. Oh, there's a ladder

2789
04:42:28,100 --> 04:42:30,100
When I see like

2790
04:42:32,580 --> 04:42:34,580
No, there's definitely cute

2791
04:42:37,780 --> 04:42:44,200
But the language it obviously used in the majority of it is like pretty like oh my

2792
04:42:47,700 --> 04:42:54,420
Yeah, no, that's what it is. It's literally verbal abuse layer. Just like some sort of like audio that you want to

2793
04:42:55,300 --> 04:42:59,660
And it's like and like a lot of it is like

2794
04:43:03,940 --> 04:43:05,940
You can ping stuff with tango

2795
04:43:08,300 --> 04:43:10,300
Help

2796
04:43:12,820 --> 04:43:14,820
Helping

2797
04:43:15,140 --> 04:43:17,380
Hypno's the best when you're like the person doing it like

2798
04:43:18,260 --> 04:43:24,140
I don't like any of it. Oh, you don't like hip-no-all or did I misunderstand?

2799
04:43:25,860 --> 04:43:28,220
Are you just mean that kind of that cat grave?

2800
04:43:32,540 --> 04:43:35,700
Where am I going? Sorry, I'm a bit confuzzled

2801
04:43:42,980 --> 04:43:44,980
I don't

2802
04:43:45,100 --> 04:43:47,100
You don't like have no oh no

2803
04:43:48,180 --> 04:43:56,780
Do you find like the the ASMR stream that I did hip-no like cringy or is it just kind of like soothing cuz I'm like being chillin

2804
04:44:00,940 --> 04:44:06,060
Consumable some debris. I don't like hip-no-self in general, but I I mean, it's all right

2805
04:44:09,940 --> 04:44:12,180
I've messed up I shouldn't have come here

2806
04:44:13,180 --> 04:44:15,180
I

2807
04:44:17,660 --> 04:44:19,660
Famine

2808
04:44:20,660 --> 04:44:25,180
You're going to the Michael that's still counts as one

2809
04:44:26,460 --> 04:44:32,780
Ha ha get it. It's the Lord of the Rings reference cuz cuz I like Lord of the Rings and stuff. Yeah

2810
04:44:35,460 --> 04:44:37,460
What's going on

2811
04:44:42,180 --> 04:44:44,180
I

2812
04:44:46,460 --> 04:44:55,100
Do love the hacking and slashing it's very satisfying. I wonder how much the time the dev team had to put into like

2813
04:44:56,100 --> 04:45:00,740
We put this like the core mechanic. It's like we have to be able to

2814
04:45:01,460 --> 04:45:07,580
Where the heck did he go? It's like we have to make it satisfying and warden for players to hack and slash

2815
04:45:07,980 --> 04:45:09,980
We

2816
04:45:10,580 --> 04:45:17,580
Spent eight months on perfecting the head being cut off by the weapon because there's more than one weapon. I

2817
04:45:18,900 --> 04:45:20,900
Don't know where that majors

2818
04:45:22,100 --> 04:45:24,100
I'll try and get these guys

2819
04:45:26,860 --> 04:45:29,900
Okay, I'm getting these guys as they come in or not

2820
04:45:31,340 --> 04:45:33,340
Refleens get doing a do my job

2821
04:45:37,700 --> 04:45:39,700
Bomber someone's dropped the bomb

2822
04:45:40,860 --> 04:45:42,860
And I was in the toilet

2823
04:45:43,140 --> 04:45:45,980
Okay, I'm pushing them off of us because there's too many I

2824
04:45:48,220 --> 04:45:52,180
Will use block I would remember to use block sometimes

2825
04:45:55,100 --> 04:46:02,980
Out out out my organs, please I need those I actually need those I know it's hard to believe but I need those organs

2826
04:46:08,140 --> 04:46:10,140
Ah

2827
04:46:14,300 --> 04:46:16,300
Yeah, I think maybe I'll force

2828
04:46:17,700 --> 04:46:20,900
Maybe try overwatching a membership stream

2829
04:46:21,780 --> 04:46:26,340
And then you guys can't believe me for just plain really basic cuz I'm not like play

2830
04:46:28,340 --> 04:46:30,340
Now that Juno's out

2831
04:46:31,060 --> 04:46:33,060
I

2832
04:46:34,660 --> 04:46:40,020
Trust me darling. Oh, are you posing on us? Wait, how did I join you in that pose?

2833
04:46:40,900 --> 04:46:46,740
Wait wrong one. No wrong one. Hold on. Don't look. This is embarrassing sit on a chair. There we go

2834
04:46:47,460 --> 04:46:49,460
You didn't see that

2835
04:46:50,140 --> 04:46:53,540
Mommy and reason for hanging out. Can you do it, too?

2836
04:46:55,340 --> 04:46:57,340
It's someone coughing

2837
04:46:58,340 --> 04:47:02,980
I this body's still alive. No, they can't be there dead

2838
04:47:06,340 --> 04:47:10,340
Look guys pose and we're just done. Maybe I've called us glick it

2839
04:47:10,340 --> 04:47:14,940
Maybe we should I just call us the posers because we're just so we're literally soccer team

2840
04:47:15,860 --> 04:47:19,140
There's a grim rebar there. I don't know if we should get it. Can we grab it?

2841
04:47:19,140 --> 04:47:22,180
I don't know. It's too much. It's too much distance being made

2842
04:47:27,340 --> 04:47:29,340
Oh

2843
04:47:41,220 --> 04:47:43,860
Stop it. I was aiming for the bad guys

2844
04:47:44,540 --> 04:47:49,140
Well, they're all bad guys. Right. Are they going back for the book? I don't know what they're doing

2845
04:47:49,140 --> 04:47:51,900
I don't know where the book is. I'm just following you

2846
04:47:53,540 --> 04:47:55,540
Look at them dodging skills. I'm so good

2847
04:47:56,460 --> 04:48:03,140
Gremors are the ones that eat up your HP. We are on easier mode. Do I state that?

2848
04:48:03,420 --> 04:48:08,440
Because I'm so MLG and I'm so used to veteran difficulty that will be okay

2849
04:48:08,440 --> 04:48:10,440
Oh

2850
04:48:20,920 --> 04:48:27,960
I'm staring straight at the post. Okay, we did it. Do you know isn't it? Wait, she's not even out yet

2851
04:48:29,040 --> 04:48:34,200
I've been lying to I thought she was out because they came out with a trailer over something

2852
04:48:34,760 --> 04:48:40,880
There was a time that I knew every book location. Definitely don't remember most of them anymore

2853
04:48:41,200 --> 04:48:47,400
You little vermin tide in brackets affectionately. Okay. I'm ready

2854
04:48:49,760 --> 04:48:55,520
We made it we're in the cellar. This is actually Mercy's dungeon

2855
04:48:55,960 --> 04:48:57,960
I

2856
04:49:02,120 --> 04:49:04,120
I'm swinging

2857
04:49:04,800 --> 04:49:10,800
No, they revealed her and did a spotlight. They do that about a month before. Oh, well, I'm in no rush to play

2858
04:49:13,680 --> 04:49:16,480
I won't force you to download it just yet. Sorry

2859
04:49:25,880 --> 04:49:27,880
I

2860
04:49:29,560 --> 04:49:34,980
Was gonna say these wine barrels are humongous. They're fermenting some crazy

2861
04:49:39,480 --> 04:49:45,880
They've still got the wax on they're like massive baby bells, I don't know if you have baby bell. Oh, no, I think you do

2862
04:49:47,280 --> 04:49:52,440
Baby bells are like a wee ball. Well, we wheel of cheese like a really tiny wheel of cheese

2863
04:49:52,480 --> 04:49:58,200
And they have a red wax on them and you peel them off and it's quite satisfying to peel off to be honest

2864
04:50:00,040 --> 04:50:04,240
Okay, I made it out. I'm swinging. I'm swinging

2865
04:50:06,760 --> 04:50:14,480
Okay, I will use the block button when I need to but I think I'm swinging so successfully against these enemies

2866
04:50:14,480 --> 04:50:16,480
I don't need to block them

2867
04:50:16,880 --> 04:50:18,880
Maybe in a harder difficulty

2868
04:50:22,760 --> 04:50:26,880
Okay, are we okay Danny to do something?

2869
04:50:38,440 --> 04:50:42,680
Yeah, they're real two weeks more until general drops juice

2870
04:50:42,680 --> 04:50:48,200
I know they have to like hype up a character to get people like come back to play in it, but

2871
04:50:48,880 --> 04:50:51,840
It just feels so rubbish now

2872
04:50:52,440 --> 04:50:57,160
Why are you go okay? I'm getting nervous when you trying to explode next to me. Oh

2873
04:50:59,200 --> 04:51:01,200
No way I accidentally send that

2874
04:51:04,560 --> 04:51:06,560
I'm swinging

2875
04:51:08,440 --> 04:51:11,480
How do you just swap between them so quickly I

2876
04:51:13,440 --> 04:51:16,040
Feel like it takes me so long to swap to you something

2877
04:51:17,600 --> 04:51:21,480
Okay, let's get just like me for real for real

2878
04:51:22,080 --> 04:51:24,080
Baby bells and dearie Lee

2879
04:51:33,120 --> 04:51:35,600
Oh, I didn't mean to do that. Sorry, I think I ruined that

2880
04:51:37,080 --> 04:51:39,080
There's another barrel here, okay, I

2881
04:51:42,440 --> 04:51:44,440
Love that gun so much

2882
04:51:45,880 --> 04:51:49,840
Dark dark tape. Oh, no

2883
04:51:51,920 --> 04:51:53,920
I

2884
04:51:54,360 --> 04:51:56,360
Got killed in his own home

2885
04:51:59,840 --> 04:52:03,240
Hear that rat. Oh, there's tons of heels up here. I

2886
04:52:06,360 --> 04:52:08,360
Could hear

2887
04:52:10,280 --> 04:52:13,400
Hold on hydration check. I'm drink that cola. Come on caffeine

2888
04:52:13,400 --> 04:52:15,400
I

2889
04:52:17,080 --> 04:52:21,440
Might get a nap I think well do is on that way up to stream and then I wake up and

2890
04:52:28,360 --> 04:52:35,000
We can have a lovely day together and then we can search for the black powder

2891
04:52:37,800 --> 04:52:42,200
That's a lot of enemies, but they are getting slain slain your enemies

2892
04:52:43,400 --> 04:52:45,400
I

2893
04:52:49,400 --> 04:52:51,400
Die will you

2894
04:52:51,800 --> 04:52:54,120
Take this and this

2895
04:52:55,880 --> 04:52:59,320
Okay, maybe I should start paying attention to the floor a wee bit more

2896
04:52:59,320 --> 04:53:01,320
Oh

2897
04:53:08,200 --> 04:53:10,600
Then enemies up here they're hating in the garden

2898
04:53:11,320 --> 04:53:14,280
They're just lurking in the shot. What are you doing like treatment?

2899
04:53:14,680 --> 04:53:18,680
They just that was the the vermin tight empire. What do you do?

2900
04:53:22,040 --> 04:53:27,160
I just hear gravel and everywhere it makes me so nervous

2901
04:53:30,200 --> 04:53:33,640
Oh my god, that's brutal the guy on the door

2902
04:53:35,800 --> 04:53:37,800
They do not hold back in this game

2903
04:53:45,000 --> 04:53:47,000
I

2904
04:53:47,000 --> 04:53:50,520
I can't okay. I'm pushing it along very slowly. I'm coming

2905
04:53:50,520 --> 04:53:52,520
Being

2906
04:53:52,760 --> 04:53:56,680
Nap after she I wake and polish my bean

2907
04:53:57,960 --> 04:53:59,960
That's such a good mole

2908
04:54:01,320 --> 04:54:05,880
That's such a good mole. Is that fire spill her ultimate?

2909
04:54:09,560 --> 04:54:13,800
I'm pushing the car. I'm pushing the car pushy pushy car

2910
04:54:16,920 --> 04:54:18,920
Are we

2911
04:54:21,400 --> 04:54:27,720
Oh my god, I love how much range the weapons have in this game like I feel sorry. I missed that but I knew what to do

2912
04:54:28,520 --> 04:54:33,240
Like it feels so satisfying like actually being able to reach the enemy

2913
04:54:34,520 --> 04:54:37,560
It doesn't feel like I'm having to do anything

2914
04:54:38,440 --> 04:54:41,240
Will you ever play scp secret lab? Is it multiplayer?

2915
04:54:43,880 --> 04:54:48,280
I know about scp a little bit what I need to do sorry. I've got an edge

2916
04:54:50,760 --> 04:54:53,800
You need to fill it. Okay, let's go get the bits and bobs

2917
04:54:56,280 --> 04:54:58,280
Uh

2918
04:55:02,440 --> 04:55:04,440
I can't even reach on

2919
04:55:06,680 --> 04:55:10,200
To complete that game motherfucker. Oh shit and to pop that

2920
04:55:11,560 --> 04:55:13,960
Kills them instantly has a drink to celebrate

2921
04:55:14,920 --> 04:55:20,760
I'm just getting absolutely scheming this game right pick up a barrel down there somewhere. Okay, I assume it's this way

2922
04:55:22,040 --> 04:55:24,040
Uh, that's just a heal

2923
04:55:26,040 --> 04:55:31,320
Uh, it's up to get down. I know that sounds silly, but sometimes games do that on purpose

2924
04:55:31,800 --> 04:55:34,440
Where they're like, oh, do you want to go up? You have to go down

2925
04:55:35,800 --> 04:55:37,960
Okay, it's not in here. That's embarrassing. Maybe it is

2926
04:55:38,840 --> 04:55:41,800
Back below just protect your mage. They know what they're doing

2927
04:55:42,520 --> 04:55:44,520
Who can pick up a bomb?

2928
04:55:45,320 --> 04:55:48,920
Okay, okay, I followed me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry the perry flint's waiting on me

2929
04:55:51,400 --> 04:55:53,400
Okay, now we

2930
04:56:00,200 --> 04:56:05,240
As if you survived the I refuse. How are they survived?

2931
04:56:06,600 --> 04:56:07,960
Okay

2932
04:56:07,960 --> 04:56:09,720
Defend the basement

2933
04:56:09,720 --> 04:56:12,680
I'm a big strong slammin

2934
04:56:13,800 --> 04:56:18,040
Oh, I need a scottish. I'm not strong anymore. Please don't leave me. I'm gay

2935
04:56:20,360 --> 04:56:22,360
It's a lot of cheese

2936
04:56:23,240 --> 04:56:26,280
It's 24 players to an scp map

2937
04:56:27,320 --> 04:56:32,440
Oh, we might have to give that a shot if it comes if it comes on kind of game

2938
04:56:32,440 --> 04:56:45,640
It's 64 players it's free and it's communications on okay

2939
04:56:47,240 --> 04:56:49,240
It's a high risk high reward stream

2940
04:56:53,960 --> 04:56:58,760
Push in a light push, okay

2941
04:56:59,960 --> 04:57:01,960
Owie

2942
04:57:02,440 --> 04:57:07,080
No, you're not allowed to do that. I was about to push the car and you ruined it

2943
04:57:13,240 --> 04:57:20,120
Uh, yeah, I need a little bit of protection on the cart, please. I'm pushing. I'm pushing

2944
04:57:22,920 --> 04:57:24,920

04:57:25,480 --> 04:57:27,480
I

2946
04:57:29,240 --> 04:57:31,240
So I want to do to the high table

2947
04:57:47,160 --> 04:57:49,960
Oh, I don't have my ultimate so I can't push them off of us

2948
04:57:52,120 --> 04:57:54,120
No

2949
04:57:55,160 --> 04:57:59,400
I'll revive you get up reefing you can do it. I believe in you

2950
04:58:00,440 --> 04:58:03,560
Don't give in. All right, we can't go that way, but this has been open

2951
04:58:05,320 --> 04:58:08,120
It has cons with proximity. Oh, that's funny though

2952
04:58:08,280 --> 04:58:13,480
I like games that have proximity chat because like if someone screams all you hear is like

2953
04:58:14,680 --> 04:58:16,680
Like in the distance type thing

2954
04:58:16,680 --> 04:58:18,680
Now that

2955
04:58:21,400 --> 04:58:23,560
She's delivered. I brought the boots

2956
04:58:34,040 --> 04:58:40,120
Something's killing me. What's oh my gosh, I can't reach you replaying

2957
04:58:40,280 --> 04:58:42,280
Oh

2958
04:58:44,200 --> 04:58:46,200
No, oh no

2959
04:58:49,560 --> 04:58:51,560
Got it

2960
04:58:54,120 --> 04:58:59,080
Stop right, I think we're getting stuck here. There's a heal here for anyone who needs the major heal

2961
04:59:05,880 --> 04:59:07,880
No

2962
04:59:10,200 --> 04:59:17,320
He's like killing me. Okay, we're just getting him up. Okay. There we go gang violence

2963
04:59:20,600 --> 04:59:25,640
And it's trying to do like the whole like oh, I can go to the left a little to the right, but I wasn't working

2964
04:59:27,000 --> 04:59:30,200
Because I was panicking and I forgot how to do it in the moment

2965
04:59:30,920 --> 04:59:32,520
But we did it

2966
04:59:32,520 --> 04:59:38,120
Are we letting repeats join now? I think so if no one claims that they've not like had a chance to play

2967
04:59:38,840 --> 04:59:40,840
Then yeah

2968
04:59:43,480 --> 04:59:45,480
Oh, well, I tried

2969
04:59:48,920 --> 04:59:53,000
Hey, but if you haven't played you're allowed to claim that you've not played it's fine

2970
04:59:53,160 --> 04:59:58,120
I don't mind at all, but we did let repeats in this round just because

2971
05:00:00,360 --> 05:00:03,400
I think I have I've either out

2972
05:00:04,120 --> 05:00:10,120
Uh, I'll walk in the reeflings because they are getting a bit tired, especially for time zones stuff

2973
05:00:11,080 --> 05:00:13,080
and

2974
05:00:13,160 --> 05:00:15,160
Oh, he's like literally a loot goblin

2975
05:00:15,960 --> 05:00:18,920
An incinerate bomb. I don't even know there was different kinds

2976
05:00:20,680 --> 05:00:22,680
They're all bombs to me

2977
05:00:23,400 --> 05:00:27,160
Oh, are we done it says escape. Oh my god. We're actually so good at this game

2978
05:00:30,360 --> 05:00:32,360
Uh, escape through the wall

2979
05:00:34,040 --> 05:00:36,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, skip through the wall

2980
05:00:36,760 --> 05:00:38,760
We did it

2981
05:00:40,040 --> 05:00:44,040
I'm just installing it now corner jump is to get the last bit

2982
05:00:45,000 --> 05:00:48,120
You power and doors can't grab it. Oh, I'm asked to go back

2983
05:00:49,880 --> 05:00:52,920
I mean we're this far now. It's not big deal if you don't get it

2984
05:00:54,920 --> 05:00:58,680
Spamming dodge isn't good though because it won't work. Oh, they all got it

2985
05:01:00,040 --> 05:01:02,040
Not the beard

2986
05:01:04,360 --> 05:01:08,680
Victoria's empire and flame

2987
05:01:09,640 --> 05:01:11,640
good

2988
05:01:12,440 --> 05:01:13,960
Oh, wait, no

2989
05:01:13,960 --> 05:01:16,760
The empire's us. We won the empire to succeed

2990
05:01:18,200 --> 05:01:21,320
I'm almost level 15 and then I get another skill point

2991
05:01:23,160 --> 05:01:26,920
I'm level 15. I get another skill point. Oh

2992
05:01:27,000 --> 05:01:29,000
Oh

2993
05:01:29,240 --> 05:01:33,880
I received a chest for my accolades because I'm just so

2994
05:01:35,080 --> 05:01:37,800
Hi, sorry. I hope you're having a good time. I had worked today's on the neighborhood

2995
05:01:37,880 --> 05:01:40,280
Oh, please don't worry. I always do more stream sniping pain

2996
05:01:40,840 --> 05:01:45,880
I have been putting the stream sniping stuff on the weekends, but I don't know some people work weekends

2997
05:01:45,880 --> 05:01:47,880
So maybe that's not the smartest idea

2998
05:01:49,320 --> 05:01:52,120
I'm going to try some stream sniping stuff

2999
05:01:53,240 --> 05:01:55,240
uh

3000
05:01:55,480 --> 05:02:00,920
Maybe for members as I said, maybe when overwatch update comes in regional

3001
05:02:02,120 --> 05:02:04,120
Should be able to change my subclass

3002
05:02:05,320 --> 05:02:07,000
Make me

3003
05:02:07,000 --> 05:02:11,000
I got accolades get the heck out of the way. You're ruining the picture

3004
05:02:12,760 --> 05:02:15,480
No, get the heck out of the way there

3005
05:02:19,240 --> 05:02:21,240
Accolades

3006
05:02:21,960 --> 05:02:23,960
Ah

3007
05:02:24,360 --> 05:02:31,640
Why did I keep frog? Oh, it's my fringe. I was like, why does it keep saying my other eyes and bling? It's my fringe

3008
05:02:32,040 --> 05:02:34,040
I must be emo

3009
05:02:38,200 --> 05:02:40,200
Okay, next friend

3010
05:02:41,480 --> 05:02:42,760
Hitchhots

3011
05:02:42,760 --> 05:02:46,200
I don't know. I can't remember how big I was that uh like this big. Yeah

3012
05:02:47,240 --> 05:02:49,240
Return to the keep soon TM

3013
05:02:49,480 --> 05:02:50,600
Um

3014
05:02:50,600 --> 05:02:54,840
More melee kills more head clicking most revised. I'm just so good

3015
05:02:56,200 --> 05:03:03,000
And most damage taken. Oh wait. No, actually, I wasn't the most damage taken surprisingly considering all things

3016
05:03:04,760 --> 05:03:07,240
239 melee kills

3017
05:03:10,840 --> 05:03:16,440
Anyone can join now or new people, uh, is there any new people? I think I've got one new friend of course

3018
05:03:17,320 --> 05:03:19,320
I don't know if you have the green yet

3019
05:03:23,480 --> 05:03:28,920
I'm not opening up my chest, but thank you for playing and we'll see if there's anyone new you

3020
05:03:31,720 --> 05:03:34,760
If you're on my friend's list you can literally just button when someone

3021
05:03:37,800 --> 05:03:40,840
Soldiers coach she gone. Oh, yeah

3022
05:03:41,640 --> 05:03:44,760
That's right. Give me more of that coach gun business. I'm all about it

3023
05:03:45,720 --> 05:03:47,720
A maincraft server would be fun

3024
05:03:49,080 --> 05:03:52,600
I thought about a member's maincraft server, but I don't know if that's weird

3025
05:03:53,640 --> 05:03:56,920
I don't know if that's weird behavior or if it should be a like

3026
05:03:59,000 --> 05:04:01,000
Because obviously you didn't want greeks and going on

3027
05:04:02,600 --> 05:04:05,560
Uh, right inventory great Sarge

3028
05:04:07,800 --> 05:04:09,800
I've got something better now

3029
05:04:09,800 --> 05:04:11,800
Oh

3030
05:04:12,680 --> 05:04:20,520
Alec fresh off the boat rapid fire piercing full middle alchemist full minute

3031
05:04:22,520 --> 05:04:29,320
Power versus gavin up power versus monsters up. I'm not and then my trinkets the same

3032
05:04:29,960 --> 05:04:31,960
Yeah

3033
05:04:33,560 --> 05:04:35,560
Wow, I love it

3034
05:04:37,800 --> 05:04:40,680
Back to a row server would be nice paywalls and okay to

3035
05:04:42,920 --> 05:04:48,600
That's common. I've seen a few people do members. I just need over a minute to finish installing

3036
05:04:49,160 --> 05:04:51,160
Sort as on game me

3037
05:04:51,480 --> 05:04:53,480
cost a bit of mid and ball back in the day

3038
05:04:53,960 --> 05:04:56,200
It's on the ground. Fine boys. I'm kneeling

3039
05:04:57,080 --> 05:05:00,200
Hey, so why did you stop now couldn't face it off to the

3040
05:05:01,880 --> 05:05:03,880
No, that's a big

3041
05:05:04,520 --> 05:05:07,800
Now I reckon some enterprise in sort cut the cables on the lift

3042
05:05:10,040 --> 05:05:12,040
From the foush leg

3043
05:05:12,600 --> 05:05:16,760
Gone in a flash and me asked some very pointed questions

3044
05:05:17,720 --> 05:05:19,720
Okay, let me write down

3045
05:05:31,160 --> 05:05:34,200
There is game chat. Yeah, I can talk to them like this

3046
05:05:35,320 --> 05:05:40,440
And there's invoice game chat as well as like they can hear me through stream if they want to listen to at the same time

3047
05:05:40,600 --> 05:05:45,240
I don't know if it's disorientating watching stream at the same time and playing in game at the same time

3048
05:05:47,240 --> 05:05:48,760
It's like

3049
05:05:48,760 --> 05:05:51,880
It's only because of the the background game noise

3050
05:05:53,000 --> 05:05:55,000
Oh my god, Deutschland

3051
05:05:57,320 --> 05:05:59,320
I'm just i think he's the german

3052
05:06:00,120 --> 05:06:05,400
I don't I don't know if he's german or not. Oh, his name is literally badder. Oh for fuck's sake. Of course. He's german

3053
05:06:06,520 --> 05:06:08,520

I don't know any spanish. I don't know any of it

3061
05:06:34,360 --> 05:06:36,360
Mail and stream shopping

I don't know it's omni. Do you want in it's technically it should be omni first if you mind. I don't know if you mind though

3084
05:08:09,000 --> 05:08:11,000
Shawnee ironed her brain out for sure

3085
05:08:11,800 --> 05:08:17,160
Oh and listen. Oh, well, then you're both getting kicked out if that's a new leaflin that hasn't had a chance to play yet

3086
05:08:23,240 --> 05:08:25,240
We're happy you're here. Yeah

3087
05:08:25,640 --> 05:08:27,240
That's all good

3088
05:08:27,240 --> 05:08:29,240

Outlasted all these

3094
05:09:02,360 --> 05:09:04,360
I already got a chance to be fair

3095
05:09:05,560 --> 05:09:17,640
Okay, I think any repeats may be out of those what they're wanting them because those are new

3096
05:09:19,400 --> 05:09:25,320
You're adding me, but you're not on the game. You're trolling me. I'm being trolled by my recoil

3097
05:09:27,880 --> 05:09:29,880

This is the name of the team. I'm sorry. Dad's lucky citrus. How about that citrus?

3122
05:11:31,320 --> 05:11:36,440
What a fucking name. I'm not named. I can't be named anymore. This is getting terrible. Oh my god. Check this

3123
05:11:41,080 --> 05:11:43,080
You know people charge for that. Oh

3124
05:11:45,560 --> 05:11:47,560
Damn

3125
05:11:47,560 --> 05:11:53,160
She really said you get a preview and nothing more you get a preview and nothing more

3126
05:11:54,840 --> 05:11:56,840
Gone

3127
05:11:57,720 --> 05:12:05,560
And what makes me people happy not at the feet you got paywall. We literally got the teas and we got promised the future content

3128
05:12:08,120 --> 05:12:10,120
Where did you go?

3129
05:12:12,520 --> 05:12:14,520
No, wait, are you still online?

3130
05:12:14,600 --> 05:12:16,600
Sentimental garden lemon

3131
05:12:19,320 --> 05:12:22,760
You got bad connection you actually offline are you pulling me?

3132
05:12:27,960 --> 05:12:29,960
Lemon

3133
05:12:30,760 --> 05:12:37,400
Did you're fucking PC and you could sell it to the stratosphere? I couldn't handle it. I got too scared to connect to me

3134
05:12:39,000 --> 05:12:41,960
It's really nice of you to make sure we can get a fair chance to say yeah

3135
05:12:42,440 --> 05:12:45,160
I don't want anyone feeling like that except kind of fuck

3136
05:12:46,760 --> 05:12:50,440
And try and make it as fair as possible plus we're getting very close to the end of the campaign

3137
05:12:51,160 --> 05:12:54,280
So the next uh if we finish the campaign

3138
05:12:54,840 --> 05:12:56,200
um

3139
05:12:56,200 --> 05:12:59,240
The only other thing we can really do is try

3140
05:12:59,800 --> 05:13:02,520
Literally one two three. We've got three more to go

3141
05:13:03,480 --> 05:13:05,480
um

3142
05:13:06,440 --> 05:13:12,120
Go go we can play veteran go

3143
05:13:14,120 --> 05:13:16,120
Go

3144
05:13:16,520 --> 05:13:20,600
Go I I don't want to play veteran, but I guess we can play veteran

3145
05:13:21,720 --> 05:13:26,440
Sure, have you done the jump puzzle in the castle? No, we got this we got this

3146
05:13:29,720 --> 05:13:31,240
You could replay on cataclysm

3147
05:13:31,240 --> 05:13:36,200
That's what I was going to do. I was going to replay the missions on a harder level and then anyone can jump in

3148
05:13:41,160 --> 05:13:43,160
It's hard

3149
05:13:44,040 --> 05:13:46,920
So am I right now

3150
05:13:49,720 --> 05:13:51,560
You can do it

3151
05:13:51,560 --> 05:13:57,160
Okay, here me and the boys me and the boy. I want a glowing sword. Why do you get a glowing sword?

3152
05:13:57,160 --> 05:13:59,160
No, I don't

3153
05:13:59,560 --> 05:14:01,560
No, I'm going to go inside

3154
05:14:03,240 --> 05:14:06,200
Right world forest locate the

3155
05:14:07,480 --> 05:14:09,160
Gull

3156
05:14:09,160 --> 05:14:10,520
site

3157
05:14:10,520 --> 05:14:12,040
rough

3158
05:14:12,040 --> 05:14:16,360
The name of some of these places is like I good luck being able to say it

3159
05:14:16,360 --> 05:14:19,160
Why can't it not just be like I go to Costa Rica?

3160
05:14:20,520 --> 05:14:22,520
Like that's easy to say

3161
05:14:23,240 --> 05:14:25,240
I

3162
05:14:29,400 --> 05:14:33,320
Wonder if I should give the major try or the bone arrow lady

3163
05:14:40,760 --> 05:14:42,760
We've got scaly boys on our team

3164
05:14:44,920 --> 05:14:50,920
Just call it the gluck got you know what that actually crossed my mind and I went to myself

3165
05:14:51,000 --> 05:14:54,120
No, that's too much brain rot and didn't say it out loud

3166
05:14:54,760 --> 05:14:59,480
I held myself back from saying it and then you're telling me that you come up with it anyway

3167
05:15:00,920 --> 05:15:02,920
Or as bad as each other

3168
05:15:03,480 --> 05:15:05,480
Was me that way in in there

3169
05:15:06,040 --> 05:15:11,960
A bonkin goes just because you haven't paid two thousand us dollars to obtain the sword in game

3170
05:15:13,160 --> 05:15:15,160
Stop is that the actual reward?

3171
05:15:15,960 --> 05:15:17,960
I

3172
05:15:19,640 --> 05:15:21,640
Chat reflects the streamer exactly

3173
05:15:23,160 --> 05:15:25,160
You're absolutely done though

3174
05:15:25,560 --> 05:15:30,520
Right, I must remember we're not playing on easy mode. I'm not playing on easy mode

3175
05:15:35,320 --> 05:15:37,320
I'm not

3176
05:15:37,560 --> 05:15:39,240
Wait, could I not

3177
05:15:39,240 --> 05:15:45,800
Level up a perk point and then I forgot to do it. I have a terrible feeling I forgot to level up a perk point

3178
05:15:48,680 --> 05:15:50,680
Um

3179
05:15:52,120 --> 05:15:57,560
Oh my gosh, this doesn't sweep the way the other weaponry does

3180
05:16:00,360 --> 05:16:02,360
I'm trying I'm trying I'm trying I'm trying

3181
05:16:06,680 --> 05:16:08,680
Ever

3182
05:16:09,320 --> 05:16:11,320
Why so many coming from behind

3183
05:16:13,720 --> 05:16:15,720
Literally

3184
05:16:19,400 --> 05:16:21,400
I don't even have a heal for you

3185
05:16:23,560 --> 05:16:25,560
Fetch me their soul

3186
05:16:26,760 --> 05:16:28,760
By your sale

3187
05:16:32,600 --> 05:16:37,000
It's like a push forward type thing for the heavy attack on this weapon

3188
05:16:37,880 --> 05:16:39,880
Yeah, wait

3189
05:16:40,840 --> 05:16:49,400
Did you know that a passive insult in oh, I might wait you where's the witch? I need to give this to the witch

3190
05:16:50,440 --> 05:16:52,440
I need to give this to the witch

3191
05:16:53,960 --> 05:17:00,680
Because the witch it doesn't feel good. I will give it to the witch now. It's the witches and she can heal

3192
05:17:01,960 --> 05:17:03,960
And it goes

3193
05:17:04,760 --> 05:17:07,560
Well, guess cleave is limited on halberd

3194
05:17:08,280 --> 05:17:10,280
They heard about your

3195
05:17:11,000 --> 05:17:13,000
Cod zombie rare. Oh

3196
05:17:13,000 --> 05:17:15,000
We can play cod in all of that

3197
05:17:15,720 --> 05:17:19,960
Oh, wait. No, I think there's ip issues if you play cod on pc

3198
05:17:22,760 --> 05:17:28,040
I need think there's some games where it's like it's too dangerous because the ip reveal or whatever

3199
05:17:29,480 --> 05:17:31,640
and

3200
05:17:31,720 --> 05:17:38,840
I think call of duty was on the list for like one of the games you absolutely do not do because it's like a big major mistake

3201
05:17:39,720 --> 05:17:42,520
Oh my god, I need to start using block please

3202
05:17:48,360 --> 05:17:50,360
Fuck sake I've got a bomba

3203
05:17:51,560 --> 05:17:53,560
I'm getting scared

3204
05:17:53,640 --> 05:17:55,640
I'm getting the gatlin out

3205
05:17:55,640 --> 05:18:00,280
I'm getting the gatslin out. Sorry brain. Oh, shit. Absolutely brain rot

3206
05:18:01,720 --> 05:18:07,880
Bomba I'm throwing a bomb. I'm throwing a bomb. Goodbye. Not my problem. Not my problem. Oh

3207
05:18:08,520 --> 05:18:11,160
Maybe a little bit my problem. I don't even know how I'm alive

3208
05:18:12,600 --> 05:18:17,400
Oh, I'm falling down. I think I've activated the next freaking attack. I'm so sorry if I have

3209
05:18:18,680 --> 05:18:21,000
I think it's like location base

3210
05:18:21,960 --> 05:18:24,360
Oh, no, starting will find our ip's and visitor how

3211
05:18:25,080 --> 05:18:27,080
Common

3212
05:18:29,240 --> 05:18:33,080
You all know what these gaven are in real life. What do you mean?

3213
05:18:35,640 --> 05:18:37,640
I'm gonna sneeze

3214
05:18:39,480 --> 05:18:43,320
No, I'm not maybe I'm I might it's coming and it's going

3215
05:18:45,080 --> 05:18:47,080
It's shy

3216
05:18:48,120 --> 05:18:50,120
Oh

3217
05:18:55,320 --> 05:18:57,320
Oh

3218
05:18:59,000 --> 05:19:01,800
Florida people hi on craig we got what?

3219
05:19:03,480 --> 05:19:08,280
I thought you were gonna be like oh the development team like made the noises of them

3220
05:19:09,080 --> 05:19:15,880
Through this like unique animal type thing. I didn't expect that. I'm gonna be honest. I didn't expect those lower notes

3221
05:19:16,360 --> 05:19:18,360
But there you go

3222
05:19:20,440 --> 05:19:23,560
What I remember there was like that bath bath

3223
05:19:24,360 --> 05:19:26,360
Bon salt sniffing

3224
05:19:27,240 --> 05:19:29,240
Media that came out about

3225
05:19:29,720 --> 05:19:31,720
everything

3226
05:19:31,720 --> 05:19:34,920
Which was rather interesting that people were sniffing back on

3227
05:19:37,160 --> 05:19:39,160
I don't know the bath salt

3228
05:19:46,920 --> 05:19:52,920
I don't know what were to go what we did we come from I'm so turned off and so turned around I'm not turned off

3229
05:19:53,880 --> 05:19:58,440
Well, I'm not turned on either in the middle of the game. You know what I mean, you know what I mean, okay?

3230
05:20:02,200 --> 05:20:05,560
I can't I can't see him fucking pulverize and rats

3231
05:20:06,280 --> 05:20:08,280
We're beating

3232
05:20:08,760 --> 05:20:10,760
I messed up with him so badly

3233
05:20:11,320 --> 05:20:13,320
I messed up so so badly

3234
05:20:15,400 --> 05:20:17,400
Turned off

3235
05:20:17,880 --> 05:20:19,880
Stop it. You're turning me on

3236
05:20:20,840 --> 05:20:22,840
Of course, we know what you mean

3237
05:20:26,600 --> 05:20:28,600
Okay, I might deal with these one

3238
05:20:31,880 --> 05:20:35,320
No strongy you can't just keep swinging at the enemies without aiming

3239
05:20:37,160 --> 05:20:39,400
Okay, what happens if I did though?

3240
05:20:40,760 --> 05:20:45,080
I'm gonna take this one because I suck but everything can take

3241
05:20:46,040 --> 05:20:51,000
I need to put it on I need to put on the mage right. I'm gonna heal up the mage when I catch up

3242
05:20:54,360 --> 05:20:59,720
So do you do you cleave on halberd by doing a little one into block

3243
05:21:09,480 --> 05:21:11,480
I need to heal the witch

3244
05:21:16,040 --> 05:21:18,040
I did it. I am a healer

3245
05:21:19,560 --> 05:21:21,560
I am not allowed to reward myself

3246
05:21:21,720 --> 05:21:26,520
30 seconds of vibration. I don't know if you guys have ever seen that stuff. Maybe I'm gonna

3247
05:21:27,080 --> 05:21:30,840
Tee hee about a lair dude. It's the funniest thing ever. It's like

3248
05:21:31,720 --> 05:21:33,720
When you when you heal

3249
05:21:34,520 --> 05:21:36,520
you're allowed to

3250
05:21:36,840 --> 05:21:41,640
Like put it on or something or I it's just bizarre. It's the most bizarre thing. You should

3251
05:21:45,080 --> 05:21:47,080
Oh

3252
05:22:07,720 --> 05:22:12,440
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. Everything's fine

3253
05:22:15,400 --> 05:22:17,400
I'm on my own

3254
05:22:17,640 --> 05:22:19,640
But I'm gonna be okay

3255
05:22:20,360 --> 05:22:23,320
Okay, I'm fine. I'm safe safe and real and true

3256
05:22:26,520 --> 05:22:29,880
Are you running it with old reasons yet? They're still new. This is a new

3257
05:22:30,840 --> 05:22:32,840
Law, I don't know if anyone's wanting to claim

3258
05:22:34,600 --> 05:22:36,600
They're new after this one

3259
05:22:38,360 --> 05:22:43,480
We did have one last run but then we got a few I don't know if people are downloading the game or not

3260
05:22:45,080 --> 05:22:47,080
Bonk

3261
05:22:49,000 --> 05:22:51,000
Wow, okay, there is a heal

3262
05:22:55,560 --> 05:22:57,560
Fetch me there though

3263
05:22:58,120 --> 05:23:01,400
You know about lingering hitboxes. Yeah. Yeah, of course I do

3264
05:23:02,360 --> 05:23:04,360
What the fuck is he on about

3265
05:23:08,280 --> 05:23:13,400
Is that a little thingy? Oh, I can't reach him. He stole her thingy my bobbers

3266
05:23:14,680 --> 05:23:20,040
I don't know. It feels like competitive gaming and aren't something to be mixed feels like it's less

3267
05:23:20,920 --> 05:23:24,360
I feel like I would get and I'm not being funny if we did a blue stream like that

3268
05:23:24,680 --> 05:23:29,400
I feel like I would get so fucking competitive that I wouldn't even like I wouldn't even be able to enjoy

3269
05:23:30,040 --> 05:23:32,040
the activity, you know

3270
05:23:33,160 --> 05:23:37,480
Because I'm just too competitive. I'm like, no, I want to win and then when I start seeing defeat on my screen

3271
05:23:37,480 --> 05:23:41,080
I'll be rage. I'll be like reeflands. Why are you why are you letting me lose? Like what the fuck is going on?

3272
05:23:41,320 --> 05:23:46,280
Why are you not bringing me the best? I need 10 out of 10 gameplay. What's going on here?

3273
05:24:00,200 --> 05:24:05,800
I don't know how I knew he was there about

3274
05:24:13,320 --> 05:24:15,640
I'd like to see you try and get an Isaac clear without

3275
05:24:18,040 --> 05:24:23,720
I'll need to test if I'm comfortable enough to sit for a long time like that

3276
05:24:24,440 --> 05:24:26,440
So I know for a fact

3277
05:24:27,160 --> 05:24:28,360
Um

3278
05:24:28,360 --> 05:24:31,000
That the clam can't handle something like that

3279
05:24:31,960 --> 05:24:33,960
There is a possibility

3280
05:24:35,000 --> 05:24:37,000
Of the

3281
05:24:38,280 --> 05:24:40,280
But it would be

3282
05:24:43,320 --> 05:24:46,680
I don't know if there's a way to set it up that it can be done for free

3283
05:24:47,800 --> 05:24:49,800
Like I don't know

3284
05:24:53,720 --> 05:24:55,720
I

3285
05:24:58,600 --> 05:25:03,720
Fetch me their ink honestly me and apology. Fetch me their ink

3286
05:25:09,880 --> 05:25:15,160
Lumber foot lumber foot. Oh, yes, because the runes are the lumber foot since Scotland

3287
05:25:17,160 --> 05:25:22,840
Sorry, I'm being a little heater. I like her character. It's cute and all but it's just every time without fail

3288
05:25:24,680 --> 05:25:28,360
Oh my god, is that a Scottish person in a video game? Let's make them

3289
05:25:31,240 --> 05:25:34,440
I hope no Dutch people are watching. Don't read the screen goddamn

3290
05:25:34,440 --> 05:25:36,440

Whoa, what's the little inklings are coming at me? Well, why would we have any reason to dodge?

3295
05:26:12,040 --> 05:26:15,080
I see she's still going. Yeah, I'm playing with my replay

3296
05:26:16,600 --> 05:26:21,800
I'm enjoying this game. This is a good stream snipe game. It's very different as well

3297
05:26:25,160 --> 05:26:31,240
Bonk bonk bonk bonk bonk bonk bonk bonk bonk

3298
05:26:33,000 --> 05:26:38,920

3299
05:26:40,120 --> 05:26:42,120
Yeah, I like this game

3300
05:26:42,840 --> 05:26:45,800
Find the entrance to the excavation site. I guess it's not that

3301
05:26:47,240 --> 05:26:49,240
Ray feeling do you need assistance?

3302
05:26:50,280 --> 05:26:54,440
Do you need an evac site? No, we're good. Come on this way

3303
05:26:54,840 --> 05:27:05,000
If you want to do it for free you could post the controlling a variant link and then post new link

3304
05:27:06,280 --> 05:27:08,280
Oh

3305
05:27:08,280 --> 05:27:10,280
Wait, so I can give like a minute

3306
05:27:11,240 --> 05:27:13,240

That's force not healing

3311
05:27:37,480 --> 05:27:39,480
I got ammo at least

3312
05:27:41,000 --> 05:27:46,280
I don't know if I come across another healing thing I might just pop this med kit on me

3313
05:27:48,360 --> 05:27:50,360
And then

3314
05:27:52,120 --> 05:27:54,120
Infections cleanse

3315
05:27:54,680 --> 05:27:56,680
Are they set?

3316
05:28:00,360 --> 05:28:03,800
I didn't even know the monsters could get sick in this game, but

3317
05:28:05,800 --> 05:28:07,800

Honestly, I definitely want to try out that witch character. She seems to be like scary dude

3345
05:30:41,800 --> 05:30:48,760
I can't remember if she can't be used like if you use her too long you start taking damage yourself

3346
05:30:49,480 --> 05:30:51,480
Or maybe like when she's fire only

3347
05:30:53,880 --> 05:30:55,880
My memory is big

3348
05:30:57,560 --> 05:31:04,040
Escape to the surface. We're escaping. We're escaping, but will we turn? Okay

3349
05:31:07,400 --> 05:31:09,400
The whole place is coming down

3353
05:31:33,560 --> 05:31:35,560

My god, I'm getting scared the screen is rumbling is this pain?

3355
05:31:43,560 --> 05:31:45,560
I'm getting nervous. We actually when we go

05:31:48,440 --> 05:31:50,920
Rattling where I just see regular one

3360
05:32:09,480 --> 05:32:12,440
I love it. I need more Gatlin and Molly

3361
05:32:13,720 --> 05:32:17,560
We did it another one. We're actually gonna finish the campaign

3362
05:32:19,160 --> 05:32:20,680
Easy

3363
05:32:20,680 --> 05:32:21,880
Good job

3364
05:32:21,880 --> 05:32:27,640

More like the pestering ground

3371
05:32:55,880 --> 05:32:59,400
Do you prefer a Gatlin over a leaflin?

3372
05:33:00,360 --> 05:33:04,120
I mean after the videos that I saw today. I feel like

3373
05:33:04,920 --> 05:33:12,360
With the strength if you will of how fast one can shoot one leafling can shoot in theory is the same

3374
05:33:12,920 --> 05:33:15,400
If not more dangerous than the Gatlin

3375
05:33:16,040 --> 05:33:19,240
The only thing is you're one pumping done. I think

3376
05:33:20,120 --> 05:33:22,120
so

3377
05:33:22,120 --> 05:33:24,120

3381
05:33:44,280 --> 05:33:46,360
Lemon, how could you do this to me?

3382
05:33:46,360 --> 05:33:48,360

05:38:12,680 --> 05:38:14,680
Who you you can join

3438
05:38:15,240 --> 05:38:20,520
You need to snipe in through the lobby. So what we'll do we'll finish the campaign and then

3439
05:38:21,320 --> 05:38:23,880
we'll muck about um

3440
05:38:25,320 --> 05:38:31,000
And see if we can do a hard mode, but don't pick up any tones or I'm gonna cry no more tone picking up

3441
05:38:33,080 --> 05:38:37,480
Okay, uh, there's no way I even have a clue what your name says it could be much the most

3442
05:38:37,960 --> 05:38:40,040
Unsupported, I'm just gonna put russian

3443
05:38:40,760 --> 05:38:42,760
Russian refling

3444
05:38:47,880 --> 05:38:50,600
So the team is hydro russian

3445
05:38:52,840 --> 05:38:54,840
And together we make

3446
05:38:59,160 --> 05:39:01,160
What do we make

3447
05:39:01,960 --> 05:39:03,960
Uh

3448
05:39:04,360 --> 05:39:05,800
We make

3449
05:39:05,800 --> 05:39:07,800
love

3450
05:39:08,040 --> 05:39:14,520
A team love. Sorry. It's such a shit name. I can't think of anything off the top of my head

3451
05:39:18,680 --> 05:39:22,120
Okay, I was like the mission and we will go in because we

3452
05:39:22,840 --> 05:39:25,160
Bruh, we're literally about to finish

3453
05:39:26,360 --> 05:39:28,360
Party doesn't meet requirements. Oh, oh

3454
05:39:28,920 --> 05:39:33,880
Oh, no. Oh such a shame that the party can't did you buy the game? Did you buy the game?

3455
05:39:33,960 --> 05:39:37,800
Just a stream snake. Why are you level one? Be honest? You're making me nervous

3456
05:39:38,920 --> 05:39:44,280
I get nervous when you guys buy games just to play with me for the first time in case it's a disappointment

3457
05:39:45,160 --> 05:39:47,160
Oh, I didn't do a skill point

3458
05:39:50,280 --> 05:39:52,280
I'll keep for you

3459
05:39:54,040 --> 05:39:58,040
You've had mobile level one don't buy games just to play with me

3460
05:39:58,760 --> 05:40:02,520
It makes me worried that you're not gonna enjoy the game

3461
05:40:04,600 --> 05:40:09,240
I would buy any game for you. Oh, yeah. How about you buy this?

3462
05:40:13,880 --> 05:40:15,880
On the house

3463
05:40:18,280 --> 05:40:22,040
They might be playing on a new character if they have to swap off their main, yeah

3464
05:40:24,040 --> 05:40:29,240
Okay, we're playing easy mode here's the plenty so i'm gonna be extra cocky and never use block at all

3465
05:40:29,320 --> 05:40:31,320
Even though I hardly use block at all

3466
05:40:33,880 --> 05:40:35,880
Buy that how much it's free

3467
05:40:36,920 --> 05:40:38,920
On the house

3468
05:40:39,000 --> 05:40:41,000
Love is free

3469
05:40:42,600 --> 05:40:44,600
Okay

3470
05:40:45,240 --> 05:40:50,040
Swinging my thingy my barber. I'll take your whole stock. Oh

3471
05:40:51,480 --> 05:40:54,600
Then maybe I should make a cute little video game about low

3472
05:40:55,320 --> 05:40:59,800
And that'll be the currency and then they'll be like how much is the love and then by the end of the game

3473
05:41:00,200 --> 05:41:02,200
You realize that it's not about

3474
05:41:02,440 --> 05:41:04,040
Uh

3475
05:41:04,040 --> 05:41:08,040
Oh my god. Oh, I can make an any cap. Oh my god. I can make any game. I want

3476
05:41:09,240 --> 05:41:11,800
Well, I will make it. I'll hire a dev team

3477
05:41:13,800 --> 05:41:15,800
I'll hire a dev team deal

3478
05:41:16,760 --> 05:41:18,760
Deal. Oh, yeah

3479
05:41:19,080 --> 05:41:21,000
Thank you

3480
05:41:21,000 --> 05:41:23,000
Really legend and don't oh me

3481
05:41:25,480 --> 05:41:29,720
I'll take 14 don't worry. I've had this game for years. Just haven't played it in a bit. That's why I

3482
05:41:30,040 --> 05:41:32,040
I explore too much about him

3483
05:41:33,480 --> 05:41:35,480
How much magic my stuff is

3484
05:41:40,360 --> 05:41:47,560
God I love the guns. They're so effective in this game. Sorry. I'm getting distracted. I don't think I'm supposed to be here

3485
05:41:48,920 --> 05:41:50,920
Are you squiddin me right now?

3486
05:41:51,960 --> 05:41:55,800
Tbh I already had vermin tied to but hadn't played it yet

3487
05:41:56,360 --> 05:42:01,000
Thanks for the excuse to play warhammer fantasy game instead of dark time long

3488
05:42:01,640 --> 05:42:07,000
Did I bring him back over to the more fantasy side of it instead of the the guns and

3489
05:42:07,800 --> 05:42:09,800
futuristic

3490
05:42:10,520 --> 05:42:18,760
It never occurred to me that it was called warhammer 40 because k because it was 40 the year 40,000 like

3491
05:42:19,880 --> 05:42:21,880
I'm a dumb dumb. It didn't occur to me

3492
05:42:22,840 --> 05:42:25,480
Thank oh my god, no, I forgot how to stay there

3493
05:42:28,280 --> 05:42:31,720
Leave me alone, please social distancing, please

3494
05:42:34,840 --> 05:42:36,840
Oh my god, are you okay?

3495
05:42:39,800 --> 05:42:45,160
You can absolutely wall it but I'm getting walled too actually speaking about taking a ball looking on a wall of it

3496
05:42:47,800 --> 05:42:49,800
Um

3497
05:42:50,760 --> 05:42:59,320
Darkened reaper surely that's how I see it kopium. I think that's it. Yes. It's actually a different universe. Ah, okay

3498
05:43:05,400 --> 05:43:10,760
This music is going 10. I don't even know instrument that is so I don't like it

3499
05:43:13,640 --> 05:43:17,160
Deal I have heels for anyone that's

3500
05:43:20,200 --> 05:43:22,200
Oh

3501
05:43:26,360 --> 05:43:28,360
I'm placing in Dyson

3502
05:43:29,800 --> 05:43:33,080
It's a stress instrument. I just please stress honestly

3503
05:43:33,240 --> 05:43:39,800
It's the same one for the tamed missions in assassin's street brotherhood whenever there's a tamed mission. It always goes

3504
05:43:44,120 --> 05:43:46,120
Rip and tear for me

3505
05:43:49,800 --> 05:43:51,800
Hydration check

3506
05:43:52,280 --> 05:43:54,280
I have a little

3507
05:43:56,600 --> 05:43:59,560
Oh, no, we've gone for toms. I know we're on easy mode, but

3508
05:44:05,160 --> 05:44:13,080
I love this. I wish I could use this gun all the time. It wasn't like, uh a wee bit of ammo

3509
05:44:13,320 --> 05:44:15,320
Oh

3510
05:44:16,920 --> 05:44:21,080
Maybe jangle in middle. It's giving her so cute with her christening arm

3511
05:44:24,840 --> 05:44:26,920
I'm with clan

3512
05:44:26,920 --> 05:44:28,920
Skyrim

3513
05:44:29,160 --> 05:44:31,160
skirt ryer

3514
05:44:31,160 --> 05:44:37,880
Death to the man man thing. Wait, you're on the enemy team. Why would you be on the enemy team?

3515
05:44:37,880 --> 05:44:39,880
Why would you be on the enemy team?

3516
05:44:47,880 --> 05:44:55,880
It's starting to give me how many rats you've killed. I think you will enjoy engineer. Get the real gatlin done

3517
05:44:57,880 --> 05:44:59,880
And

3518
05:44:59,880 --> 05:45:01,880
The dwarf mining game

3519
05:45:03,880 --> 05:45:05,880
Deep world galactic

3520
05:45:08,840 --> 05:45:11,880
I used to play tourbjorn in overwatch

3521
05:45:12,920 --> 05:45:14,920
Tourbjorn ready to twerk

3522
05:45:15,640 --> 05:45:17,640
I can ditch the grim

3523
05:45:19,720 --> 05:45:24,280
No in this the gun. Oh when he jerked his pincers

3524
05:45:29,560 --> 05:45:35,080
Trust me. I'm an engineer. What's the heck just happened here? Trust me. I'm an engineer

3525
05:45:35,640 --> 05:45:40,280
Well, if they're not drinking it, I'll drink bottoms up

3526
05:45:49,720 --> 05:45:55,320
Stony's gonna be so confused with the warhammer 40k faction

3527
05:45:57,400 --> 05:46:01,880
Oh, no, I can hear the grabby one. Hold on

3528
05:46:05,880 --> 05:46:07,880
I

3529
05:46:08,440 --> 05:46:10,440
Tooted

3530
05:46:11,320 --> 05:46:14,920
Maybe so quiet that it wouldn't even been picked up in

3531
05:46:16,280 --> 05:46:20,360
In deep rock. It's the soldier that has a gatlin. Yeah

3532
05:46:22,360 --> 05:46:24,360
Yeah, I gotta play that game

3533
05:46:26,280 --> 05:46:32,680
I'm you know, she's not oh, you don't have to tell me twice. I don't know how to highlight that stuff you guys

3534
05:46:35,080 --> 05:46:37,080
I don't know

3535
05:46:39,400 --> 05:46:42,920
Hey, no, you're a rock star. Get your game on. Let's go

3536
05:46:58,680 --> 05:47:00,680
Why we're at straight swamp

3537
05:47:01,640 --> 05:47:07,480
Oh, I just realized I'm doing an ASMR stream tomorrow with I can like my webcam

3538
05:47:07,480 --> 05:47:12,120
Oh, I'm getting a wee bit burn. Wee bit chilly everyone back off at back off

3539
05:47:12,280 --> 05:47:16,840
That's why I use my ultimate when you all start getting a bit too close. Um, I

3540
05:47:20,040 --> 05:47:23,080
Will show my schedule right at the start of stream

3541
05:47:23,080 --> 05:47:28,360
But then I'll like take off the screen and you know show the juicy thighs because that's what people be here for

3542
05:47:29,000 --> 05:47:31,000
And I respect it and then I'll talk about it

3543
05:47:31,480 --> 05:47:34,120
Because I've got a membership stream where I'm writing scripts

3544
05:47:34,840 --> 05:47:40,840
I am praying I get enough sleep that I'm cool use of enough because um, you guys gave me a script idea

3545
05:47:40,840 --> 05:47:42,840
I wanted to do for this month

3546
05:47:42,840 --> 05:47:44,840
I can't remember what it was

3547
05:47:45,240 --> 05:47:49,160
But I really wanted to do it out. Thank you. Um

3548
05:47:51,240 --> 05:47:55,240
Oh, you gave me a plot I really wanted to do and I forgot

3549
05:47:56,120 --> 05:47:58,120
Oh

3550
05:48:09,800 --> 05:48:12,440
The doughnut stacking one no, that's a youtube one

3551
05:48:13,480 --> 05:48:18,520
That one is more that one can't really be written into a script like it has to be done in the moment

3552
05:48:19,080 --> 05:48:21,080
Because if if I read it from a script

3553
05:48:21,320 --> 05:48:23,320
Like

3554
05:48:23,640 --> 05:48:27,320
Haven't you noted like eight of them down? I didn't note the last one down that I wanted to do

3555
05:48:29,960 --> 05:48:32,360
I decided the park bench is out of my

3556
05:48:33,720 --> 05:48:40,840
Abilities right now to do it justice, but there is a plot you guys gave me that I really like and of course I've forgotten it

3557
05:48:43,000 --> 05:48:45,000
Pretty sure it's the kissing one

3558
05:48:45,160 --> 05:48:52,120
Hold on a minute my brain my the electricity of my brain is starting to

3559
05:48:53,160 --> 05:48:55,160
move a little bit between

3560
05:48:55,800 --> 05:48:57,800
brain cells and wrinkles

3561
05:48:58,600 --> 05:49:00,600
I think

3562
05:49:01,960 --> 05:49:03,960
It was a kissing one

3563
05:49:05,240 --> 05:49:08,360
And I tie you down

3564
05:49:09,720 --> 05:49:11,720
And make you

3565
05:49:15,240 --> 05:49:17,240
Oh, I dry. Yes, I dry

3566
05:49:19,240 --> 05:49:21,240
You

3567
05:49:22,440 --> 05:49:26,280
I dry bump you and keep kissing you until you

3568
05:49:28,040 --> 05:49:30,040
Do your thing

3569
05:49:30,920 --> 05:49:32,760
Yeah

3570
05:49:32,760 --> 05:49:35,960
Because I've not been doing any kissing because I'm really bad at writing it

3571
05:49:35,960 --> 05:49:40,120
So I wanted to do a whole dedicated script to it because I thought that would be very sweet

3572
05:49:45,000 --> 05:49:47,000
Oh

3573
05:49:51,080 --> 05:49:57,800
Sorry, I oh sorry. I thought I just let that keg on fire, but it's your hair. I literally

3574
05:49:59,560 --> 05:50:01,560
Thought I let your fire in here there

3575
05:50:04,440 --> 05:50:12,440
Okay, uh, that's what we I hope to write about tomorrow if I'm not too tired. I just need to sleep

3576
05:50:13,400 --> 05:50:18,120
Like as I said after the stream I'm gonna sleep and then I'm gonna wake up

3577
05:50:19,000 --> 05:50:21,560
And do something and push something

3578
05:50:22,520 --> 05:50:24,760
And then put the shorts on the girls channels

3579
05:50:26,120 --> 05:50:28,120
And then order some emotes

3580
05:50:42,680 --> 05:50:44,680
What

3581
05:50:45,000 --> 05:50:47,000
That was a good game

3582
05:50:49,960 --> 05:50:51,960
Stop it

3583
05:50:51,960 --> 05:50:55,720
There's med kits here, which makes me think that is the boss fight

3584
05:50:57,640 --> 05:51:01,400
Have a great rest of the stream. I'll check out the what after sleep well rest well

3585
05:51:02,600 --> 05:51:04,360
or

3586
05:51:04,360 --> 05:51:11,000
Deal with adult responsibilities. Well, thank you for hanging again. Anyone that needs to rest, please don't worry

3587
05:51:11,080 --> 05:51:15,880
Um, you're not gonna miss out on much. This is the second last mission

3588
05:51:16,760 --> 05:51:18,760
And then we do the last mission

3589
05:51:19,400 --> 05:51:21,400
and then

3590
05:51:23,480 --> 05:51:25,480
Uh, we're gonna

3591
05:51:25,880 --> 05:51:26,440
That's it

3592
05:51:26,440 --> 05:51:32,440
Like we're gonna muck about and see if we can maybe do one of the levels higher than they are in difficulty

3593
05:51:32,920 --> 05:51:36,600
Or maybe we'll try like insane difficulty. I don't think it's possible

3594
05:51:37,240 --> 05:51:40,120
If you're on easy says what we're making it. Oh, maybe I should heal

3595
05:51:41,960 --> 05:51:43,960
Getting tired darling

3596
05:51:49,560 --> 05:51:51,560
Okay, I'll pop this

3597
05:51:53,560 --> 05:51:57,320
That's so blinding you didn't have to do that. No, no really don't blame me again

3598
05:51:57,320 --> 05:51:59,320
Um

3599
05:52:06,440 --> 05:52:11,160
Let me use the grind for higher level power. I am so she can even do legendary. Oh, I forgot about that

3600
05:52:11,720 --> 05:52:13,400
draft

3601
05:52:13,400 --> 05:52:19,480
I think I could go to the next level whatever comes next. I'm sure I've probably got enough right copium

3602
05:52:19,720 --> 05:52:21,720
I

3603
05:52:22,280 --> 05:52:30,360
Actually quite, uh, I admire that leveling up system where you can't just do hard right away because you need to

3604
05:52:30,920 --> 05:52:32,920
um

3605
05:52:33,560 --> 05:52:35,560
I believe yeah, baby

3606
05:52:37,720 --> 05:52:43,800
Um, I like that kind of thing where you have to work your way up before you even get the rewards for doing the hard stuff

3607
05:52:44,200 --> 05:52:46,200
and

3608
05:52:46,200 --> 05:52:48,200
It's rather satisfying

3609
05:52:50,120 --> 05:52:52,680
As champion 200 or 300

3610
05:52:53,400 --> 05:52:55,400
and

3611
05:52:56,520 --> 05:52:58,520
You'd know better than me unfortunately

3612
05:53:09,560 --> 05:53:13,480
Oh, we're going to do a defy. Are we ready reeflings?

3613
05:53:13,480 --> 05:53:15,480
I

3614
05:53:17,000 --> 05:53:19,800
They let us over cage just like the animals we are

3615
05:53:33,560 --> 05:53:35,560
That did nothing

3616
05:53:36,360 --> 05:53:38,360
Oh

3617
05:53:39,960 --> 05:53:41,960
Okay, that was rich

3618
05:53:43,240 --> 05:53:46,120
So does this not penetrate his armor it doesn't

3619
05:53:46,920 --> 05:53:48,920
Ow, stop it

3620
05:53:49,960 --> 05:53:51,960
I don't have a bomb

3621
05:53:52,440 --> 05:53:56,920
Stop why does he keep throwing us halfway across the map? That's so stinky

3622
05:53:57,880 --> 05:53:59,880
Stop it

3623
05:54:00,280 --> 05:54:02,280
I'm

3624
05:54:03,960 --> 05:54:06,520
Why are we supposed to do he keeps doing this away?

3625
05:54:09,000 --> 05:54:11,720
Oh, I hit him in the head okay his head took it

3626
05:54:14,200 --> 05:54:16,200
Over teabagging him, okay

3627
05:54:17,240 --> 05:54:19,240
Mummy see mummy do

3628
05:54:19,560 --> 05:54:21,560
Your gun has low penetration

3629
05:54:24,120 --> 05:54:27,320
What did you why am I getting gun shamed?

3630
05:54:28,040 --> 05:54:30,540
My gun has low penetration

3631
05:54:33,400 --> 05:54:35,400
Shocking

3632
05:54:35,800 --> 05:54:40,360
Okay, actually good night then. Okay. Good night. Thank you for playing and hanging

3633
05:54:41,640 --> 05:54:44,760
Rest well little reeflings that need to sleep. Okay. Good night

3634
05:54:46,120 --> 05:54:48,120
See you in your dreams

3635
05:54:48,360 --> 05:54:52,440
Because I'm going to be nothing too and I'm going to come haunt your dreams. I'm gonna high

3636
05:54:53,400 --> 05:54:58,920
My accent's back again right anyway, and now to teach you some real scots. So canny cannot

3637
05:54:59,480 --> 05:55:02,440
Denny do not well any will not

3638
05:55:06,360 --> 05:55:11,800
Your gun is good for bumping damage into unarmored targets only oh, we're done

3639
05:55:14,120 --> 05:55:16,120
Oh my god

3640
05:55:16,120 --> 05:55:18,120
Deep fried chaos warrior

3641
05:55:18,520 --> 05:55:23,880
We did it. We did it. We're on the last mission. We did it. We did it. We're on the last

3642
05:55:26,440 --> 05:55:28,440
Can I shoot out of the bowl?

3643
05:55:31,880 --> 05:55:33,880
Oh, I can't shoot

3644
05:55:34,680 --> 05:55:37,080
Oh, I've got an achievement complete act three

3645
05:55:38,040 --> 05:55:40,040
right glend rumble

3646
05:55:40,040 --> 05:55:42,040
The war camp gg

3647
05:55:43,320 --> 05:55:45,160
Okay

3648
05:55:45,160 --> 05:55:49,720
Last mission we're doing it now. Does anyone have claim to the throne?

3649
05:55:51,400 --> 05:55:55,640
That they've not played with me yet any claimers any pro claimers

3650
05:56:00,840 --> 05:56:02,840
I'm going to do a few more rounds

3651
05:56:03,080 --> 05:56:05,080
Anyway, I'm just mucking about

3652
05:56:05,400 --> 05:56:07,800
Shawnee and her dreams come here and let mummy hear for you

3653
05:56:08,680 --> 05:56:11,160
Come here and let mummy care for you

3654
05:56:11,720 --> 05:56:12,920
That's right

3655
05:56:12,920 --> 05:56:17,480
Claim your spot now or forever hold your peace amen. I got a strong hold but

3656
05:56:23,720 --> 05:56:25,720
Right

3657
05:56:27,240 --> 05:56:29,640
You know what this is starting to feel targeted now

3658
05:56:31,160 --> 05:56:35,160
This feels targeted. How not one accolade to my name

3659
05:56:35,960 --> 05:56:37,960
I

3660
05:56:39,640 --> 05:56:46,280
500 milk mummy's gun doesn't need it reefland's handle the penetration around here. Oh, oh that's smooth. I like that

3661
05:56:48,200 --> 05:56:51,880
I'd like to hop in for a higher difficulty. Yes, you can more than certainly try that

3662
05:56:52,760 --> 05:56:54,760
Yeah, you did good. Nobody died

3663
05:56:56,200 --> 05:56:57,960
Did somebody die?

3664
05:56:57,960 --> 05:57:01,480
I feel like I'm at a few. I cannot wait to watch the hobbit movie with you

3665
05:57:02,120 --> 05:57:03,720
Okay, right

3666
05:57:03,720 --> 05:57:06,200
Inventory talent points finally

3667
05:57:06,920 --> 05:57:15,080
Deal 40 more damage to staggered enemies each hit against the staggered adds to the count of stagger bonus

3668
05:57:16,840 --> 05:57:19,800
The first enemy hit always counts as staggered

3669
05:57:20,920 --> 05:57:22,120
Right

3670
05:57:22,120 --> 05:57:27,160
Increased total power level by seven. This is calculated before other buffs are applied

3671
05:57:27,160 --> 05:57:32,200
It's targeted I think

3672
05:57:34,440 --> 05:57:36,440
I don't know if there was like a

3673
05:57:45,000 --> 05:57:48,920
I'm like no, I don't okay. I have 217 hero power

3674
05:57:49,960 --> 05:57:51,960
and

3675
05:57:52,360 --> 05:57:54,520
Okay, I don't there's no new friend request

3676
05:57:54,600 --> 05:57:59,880
I don't think there's anyone in here. A lot of people didn't like hobbit bandrate it. No, I don't think there's any claimers. I think

3677
05:58:01,240 --> 05:58:05,240
Wait, hold on. Not yet. I just want to see highest obtainable

3678
05:58:08,040 --> 05:58:10,040
Okay, whatever

3679
05:58:10,200 --> 05:58:12,200
uh

3680
05:58:12,280 --> 05:58:15,000
Yes, anyone can come in almost come in

3681
05:58:16,120 --> 05:58:18,200
Because there's no claimers to the throne. Okay

3682
05:58:19,640 --> 05:58:22,520
It's that a deed deed of valor

3683
05:58:24,840 --> 05:58:29,080
God, that's what everyone used to call valor when it first came out. They were like saying it like that

3684
05:58:37,400 --> 05:58:39,400
Hello any increase

3685
05:58:40,200 --> 05:58:45,960
hydration food check uh eight earlier. Don't worry. I promise I've not been going

3686
05:58:46,760 --> 05:58:50,840
Six hours. We've been playing together for this fantastic

3687
05:58:51,880 --> 05:58:53,880
aim

3688
05:58:54,280 --> 05:59:00,920
I already got some warm tuna and you go to sleep. Good night. Good night. I look forward to seeing what you do after stream when I get up

3689
05:59:01,960 --> 05:59:04,680

3691
05:59:08,600 --> 05:59:10,360

3693
05:59:13,480 --> 05:59:15,480
Uh, what do I click?

3694
05:59:17,000 --> 05:59:19,000

You need to clean chair

3703

06:00:04,440 --> 06:00:08,040
Okay, I will put on anything that says upgrades

3705

Another one that levels me up. I'm at hero power two to eat. That's not bad

06:00:30,840 --> 06:00:36,360
Oh, no, my gatlin isn't my gatlin. Sorry. Yatlin you're out. I want my gatlin back

So, let me get this straight. You're not

Wait, did you shorten your name so it comes on screen?

3723
06:01:34,840 --> 06:01:37,400
I think you did because now it fits on screen

3724
06:01:39,160 --> 06:01:41,560
Lanny boy and cali

3725
06:01:42,680 --> 06:01:45,960
I'm gonna call us the experience. Okay

3726
06:01:49,080 --> 06:01:53,160
Ta-da, experience team. No, I switched character

3727
06:01:57,000 --> 06:02:01,400
Okay, I've done that. I guess this is the last mission we did it

3728
06:02:03,720 --> 06:02:06,120
We will play the rest together

3729
06:02:06,200 --> 06:02:15,400
Thank god. Sorry. Thank god. Someone's on a low account. I don't want to play the hard one. Um, we will play

3730
06:02:16,280 --> 06:02:18,780
the three other chapters

3731
06:02:20,600 --> 06:02:23,000
Together at a later date. Um

3732
06:02:24,360 --> 06:02:27,000
Just I would like to get some variety on the stream side game

3733
06:02:27,960 --> 06:02:32,520
My shell is still the same. It's okay. It doesn't matter what color your shell is

3734
06:02:33,640 --> 06:02:35,640
As long as you let me rub it

3735
06:02:37,080 --> 06:02:40,680
I'm gonna cook dinner later strunnion. The what?

3736
06:02:45,800 --> 06:02:47,800
Why did you call my reeflings?

3737
06:02:53,560 --> 06:02:55,720
Uh

3738
06:02:55,720 --> 06:02:58,440
Any chance of dark tide? Actually, yes

3739
06:02:59,560 --> 06:03:04,680
Oh wait, did someone lag out? Oh someone lagged out. Hold on. Let me cancel someone lagged out

3740
06:03:05,640 --> 06:03:09,400
Head out cancel. I've tend to cancel. Right. Popo. I broke

3741
06:03:10,600 --> 06:03:12,600
a reefling DC

3742
06:03:14,120 --> 06:03:17,320
Surely he meant rappers and m&m

3743
06:03:19,400 --> 06:03:21,400
Surely

3744
06:03:23,480 --> 06:03:25,480
Just know he missed one later on crap

3745
06:03:27,240 --> 06:03:31,640
Probably because we like hip-hop around these parts. Why yes, of course

3746
06:03:32,360 --> 06:03:34,360
Sure sure

3747
06:03:36,200 --> 06:03:39,720
Not to be confused with thank you and mandarin which is sure sure

This is a prank

3759
06:04:30,680 --> 06:04:35,800
How right go and come down and show me what you did come down and show me what you did, right?

Oh for fuck's sake, right

3761
06:04:39,400 --> 06:04:44,040
Right. No, that's just cheesy doodling. I'm getting pushed by something the game just hates me

3762
06:04:44,680 --> 06:04:46,680
Okay, and now it does it

3763
06:04:47,080 --> 06:04:49,080
Right, and then how'd I get up here?

3764
06:04:49,880 --> 06:04:51,880

06:04:54,440 --> 06:04:56,440
Mysterious tunnel

3767
06:04:56,840 --> 06:04:58,840
You don't have to tell me twice

3768
06:05:00,440 --> 06:05:02,440
This there's a hidden tunnel

3769
06:05:07,720 --> 06:05:09,720
Castle up in here

3770
06:05:11,720 --> 06:05:13,720
I'm sorry

3771
06:05:13,720 --> 06:05:16,280
There's a hidden tunnel. You're there. What'd I come out?

3772
06:05:18,600 --> 06:05:20,600
Is this is this hidden lower

3773
06:05:24,680 --> 06:05:31,240
What am I supposed to do in here? It's a bed. Are we humping? Is that what we're doing? Are we all humping here?

3774
06:05:33,320 --> 06:05:35,880
Oh, is there something to do is it lower?

3775
06:05:37,560 --> 06:05:39,560
There's ink on the canvas

3776
06:05:39,560 --> 06:05:44,520
Is that is that why we're here? We're humping on the bed. Are we humping beyond it?

3777
06:05:49,160 --> 06:05:51,880
I don't know if we're humping or not. Is that why I'm here

3778
06:05:52,760 --> 06:05:55,880
I'm not gonna question that I'm just here for a good time at the end of the day

3779
06:06:00,200 --> 06:06:07,240
I don't I mean, I don't know why I'm here. I don't know why I've been brought here. I don't exactly brought against my will

3780
06:06:11,160 --> 06:06:16,200
I mean, it's a tower what you're supposed to rescue me from it

3781
06:06:16,280 --> 06:06:24,200
Nothing else. Oh, right. Okay. Okay. Sorry. I thought there was like some like something I have to touch or interact with

3782
06:06:24,840 --> 06:06:27,800
Just showing you there's a little little hidden thing. Okay

3783
06:06:31,560 --> 06:06:33,560
Okay, we're doing it

3784
06:06:34,760 --> 06:06:37,880
The we're doing the last mission the

3785
06:06:39,320 --> 06:06:45,720
Skitter gate. Okay. The time has come people the gate guards have been thinned

3786
06:06:46,360 --> 06:06:49,640
The raw blood forces lack leadership and dear old

3787
06:06:50,840 --> 06:06:52,840
Rat

3788
06:06:55,560 --> 06:07:02,040
Uh is some self congratulatory victory speech. This is our chance to destroy the gate

3789
06:07:02,440 --> 06:07:06,120
Now just let me finish before you start screaming bloody murder

3790
06:07:06,200 --> 06:07:10,360
You must go through the gate and travel to north sea

3791
06:07:10,920 --> 06:07:15,080
It's the only way so listen carefully if you don't do exactly as I say you won't be coming back

3792
06:07:17,160 --> 06:07:19,160
That's rather scary

3793
06:07:20,360 --> 06:07:22,360
Okay, let's go

3794
06:07:23,400 --> 06:07:25,400
The final mission is a big one

3795
06:07:26,360 --> 06:07:28,360
I think it was supposed to be fun

3796
06:07:37,320 --> 06:07:40,600
It's loners to be believed the skitter gates no longer guarded

3797
06:07:40,600 --> 06:07:42,600
It's

3798
06:07:43,400 --> 06:07:45,400
I'm not yawning because I'm bored. I'm yawning because I'm tired

3799
06:07:46,760 --> 06:07:48,920
There'll be no peace until we destroy the track

3800
06:07:51,000 --> 06:07:58,920
I was gonna try a harder difficulty like we just muck about for like maybe another half an hour or whatever

3801
06:08:00,280 --> 06:08:03,640
I don't know how long this mission I assume because it's the last one

3802
06:08:11,320 --> 06:08:13,320
I

3803
06:08:25,320 --> 06:08:30,600
Nothing over there. I thought that was the way that's not that he's not doing it. Just the fake way

3804
06:08:31,960 --> 06:08:33,960
This is the way

3805
06:08:34,040 --> 06:08:36,040
Okay, pull the lever refling

3806
06:08:36,920 --> 06:08:38,920
Correct lever

3807
06:08:40,600 --> 06:08:42,600
She's bored of it. No, stop it

3808
06:08:49,480 --> 06:08:53,160
What's that? Oh, it's a loot wrap

3809
06:08:54,920 --> 06:08:58,840
We're what stop it. You do nothing. Do we rather fix me?

3810
06:09:00,440 --> 06:09:04,920
I'm not bored. I'm falling young if I was bored

3811
06:09:05,880 --> 06:09:07,000
I'd

3812
06:09:07,000 --> 06:09:09,000
fucking walk

3813
06:09:09,720 --> 06:09:11,720
I'll stream for two minutes and be like

3814
06:09:19,560 --> 06:09:21,560
I do love that gun

3815
06:09:23,480 --> 06:09:31,000
My compliments to the chef that designed it truly a satisfying weapon get me on dark tide right now

3816
06:09:33,480 --> 06:09:37,080
I'll see what it's about as I said, I'll look up a video. Um

3817
06:09:38,040 --> 06:09:42,280
Is it this it's not the same gameplay in the future what guns is it?

3818
06:09:42,360 --> 06:09:47,080
I mean if it is sorry different universe, but we in a different timeline

3819
06:09:48,200 --> 06:09:51,240
I mean, I wouldn't hate it at all

3820
06:09:55,320 --> 06:09:58,200
I'll eat the blunt force attack is enough to just do them in

3821
06:09:58,920 --> 06:10:00,920
I

3822
06:10:05,960 --> 06:10:10,920
Don't know why I felt so sick at the start of stream, but I feel fine now that was really bizarre

3823
06:10:10,920 --> 06:10:14,040
I don't know why I felt so ill. I feel fine now

3824
06:10:15,560 --> 06:10:21,640
I'm just an I'm unhealthy being my hp bar is rather low in real life, which is strange because I've not

3825
06:10:22,200 --> 06:10:24,200
Really had to deal with it too much

3826
06:10:24,920 --> 06:10:27,160
I'm pinned. I'm pinned because of this freaking thing

3827
06:10:28,680 --> 06:10:30,520
Um

3828
06:10:30,520 --> 06:10:36,840
Okay, we're fine. We're fine. I got a bit panicky. I got a wee bit panicky, but it's okay. I dealt with it like a big girl

3829
06:10:37,640 --> 06:10:39,640
Oh, there's something going for me. What?

3830
06:10:40,280 --> 06:10:42,280
you

3831
06:10:51,400 --> 06:10:55,800
Maybe it was a rooflings withdrawal symptoms. We have too much of a pool on each other

3832
06:10:56,760 --> 06:10:58,760
I'd imagine that

3833
06:11:03,720 --> 06:11:05,960
We're needed to get used to that again after yesterday

3834
06:11:05,960 --> 06:11:07,960
Oh

3835
06:11:21,640 --> 06:11:24,680
Wow the game literally tells you not to heal small wins

3836
06:11:27,880 --> 06:11:31,160
Oh my god, do you guys want to do the honors or?

3837
06:11:31,400 --> 06:11:33,400
Oh

3838
06:11:35,240 --> 06:11:38,680
It's like a pool mechanic. Okay, I'll do the honors even though I didn't get us here

3839
06:11:41,320 --> 06:11:43,820
Okay, so they have access to electricity

3840
06:11:46,920 --> 06:11:48,920
This is rather uh

3841
06:11:51,880 --> 06:11:56,040
Rather intricate for the rats to come up with I have to admit

3842
06:11:58,040 --> 06:12:00,040
Go through the gate

3843
06:12:01,880 --> 06:12:03,880
Oh

3844
06:12:04,200 --> 06:12:09,240
Why does this seem like a terrible idea? Oh, by the way, go through the gate of the enemy

3845
06:12:10,680 --> 06:12:12,680
Drop it you hurt me

3846
06:12:13,800 --> 06:12:15,800
Mummy has the honor of filling the lever

3847
06:12:18,520 --> 06:12:20,520
Oh, is it magic?

3848
06:12:21,880 --> 06:12:27,320
That's getting really bright. So motherfucker am I in? Okay. Jeez. That was so bright

3849
06:12:28,040 --> 06:12:29,320
I

3850
06:12:29,320 --> 06:12:34,520
Couldn't even look at the damn screen there. I forget again and I'll go off. We're gamers. We're in dark rooms

3851
06:12:35,400 --> 06:12:41,240
Development teams, please understand who's playing your games. It's not people playing in broad sunlight. What the fuck?

3852
06:12:42,280 --> 06:12:48,120
Knock it off. Well, if I become president, that's the first thing I'm changing. I'm out

3853
06:12:49,160 --> 06:12:51,160
I'm banning freaking flash and

3854
06:12:52,600 --> 06:12:54,600
That's

3855
06:12:58,040 --> 06:13:00,040
I

3856
06:13:03,080 --> 06:13:05,080
Showing for president

3857
06:13:08,840 --> 06:13:16,040
Oh, I'm gonna go against the boss. That's right. Oh, I learned so much. I'm blocking and staggering

3858
06:13:18,440 --> 06:13:21,080
Make light mode illegal I'd vote for you for that. Yeah

3859
06:13:21,080 --> 06:13:23,080
I

3860
06:13:23,320 --> 06:13:26,440
And game dev teams hate her because she spoke the truth

3861
06:13:28,360 --> 06:13:30,360
Just because you don't want to admit it

3862
06:13:32,680 --> 06:13:39,400
Scaven lore wise are the most intelligent species in this universe that makes me insane machines that can rival magic

3863
06:13:39,400 --> 06:13:44,040
But they are back stabby so they always kind of cause their own downfall

3864
06:13:45,080 --> 06:13:47,240
For being silly billies basically

3865
06:13:48,040 --> 06:13:50,040
I think he's like stanley parable

3866
06:13:50,760 --> 06:13:57,880
I've never played it. I see vtuber's play it. So I don't I don't know if it's an access like an easy accessible game

3867
06:14:08,440 --> 06:14:10,440
You would love stanley parable

3868
06:14:11,400 --> 06:14:13,400
Oh

3869
06:14:16,280 --> 06:14:22,520
It's a single player store game it's accessible you walk around and it's just a cracking joke

3870
06:14:23,800 --> 06:14:25,800
Hi, today's my birthday

3871
06:14:27,080 --> 06:14:29,880
Where's your my little pony profile picture? What the heck?

3872
06:14:32,520 --> 06:14:36,360
Only one person's gonna get that straight for it's also so happy birthday by the way

3873
06:14:37,320 --> 06:14:39,320
Um

3874
06:14:39,720 --> 06:14:41,720
Um

3875
06:14:41,720 --> 06:14:47,720
Stanley pario is very weird but funny especially if you go and blame very okay. Okay, right no more spot

3876
06:14:47,720 --> 06:14:52,840
Maybe we'll give that a check. I don't is it like I can finish it and wrap up and get all achievements

3877
06:14:52,920 --> 06:14:55,320
Or is it just kind of like one of those games like

3878
06:14:56,120 --> 06:15:00,200
Suica where you put it on for like a couple of hours to entertain yourself and

3879
06:15:01,480 --> 06:15:03,880
You can get into it as much as you desire or not

3880
06:15:07,000 --> 06:15:09,000
My little pony birthday boy

3881
06:15:09,160 --> 06:15:11,160
Come on. Good thing

3882
06:15:11,160 --> 06:15:18,440
It's a casual narrative game. So there's no real loose. Okay. Okay a game. I can't loosen is easily accessible

3883
06:15:19,080 --> 06:15:21,400
Oh my it's got me written all over it

3884
06:15:23,400 --> 06:15:27,960
You mean I don't have to try hard. I mean even I'm not sure I call this gameplay tryhard

3885
06:15:27,960 --> 06:15:29,960
Oh

3886
06:15:40,360 --> 06:15:42,360
That didn't work good

3887
06:15:43,960 --> 06:15:48,600
I know it's not penetrating but I can't help but want to scream free

3888
06:15:49,720 --> 06:15:52,600
I'm burning alive and becoming human jerky right now

3889
06:15:52,600 --> 06:15:54,600
I

3890
06:15:56,200 --> 06:16:01,320
Got the squadron they're carried out. I really want those purple weapons back. I'm not allowed thumbs

3891
06:16:03,320 --> 06:16:10,760
Okay, I yanked it because obviously it's very important for me to have ammo even though I'm not the gun specialist

3892
06:16:12,680 --> 06:16:18,280
I thought you meant easily accessible. It's like infinite engine. It's like no spoilers, you know

3893
06:16:19,240 --> 06:16:23,720
If you got all achievements, you have to change your PC's time setting. Oh, no. All right, okay

3894
06:16:23,720 --> 06:16:28,840
We're not going for full achievements, but I'll I'll muck about on it. Oh, I didn't realize I was one of the grabbers

3895
06:16:28,840 --> 06:16:34,280
I'm sorry. I got a jump here. Okay reach the southern gate. Okay

3896
06:16:35,640 --> 06:16:37,640
We are now in the tundra

3897
06:16:38,520 --> 06:16:40,520
Because look at how much ice is here

3898
06:16:44,280 --> 06:16:46,280
Not again, okay

3899
06:16:46,360 --> 06:16:48,360
Stop it. I'm mucking about

3900
06:16:48,600 --> 06:16:53,160
No, right. That's what you're getting altered right now. Everyone's getting a spank spank spank spank

3901
06:16:54,120 --> 06:16:56,120
If you're staggered you're getting spank

3902
06:16:56,920 --> 06:17:00,840
Twice as hard actually. I think I have like 60 spank on the stagger

3903
06:17:04,600 --> 06:17:08,920
There's just grips at enemies everywhere. They're just being shitting

3904
06:17:11,400 --> 06:17:13,400
You know what I'm glad they can enjoy the scenery

3905
06:17:13,400 --> 06:17:17,720
I'm gonna enjoy the scenery too. Mm beautiful. Not one plant in existence in the tundra

3906
06:17:19,640 --> 06:17:23,400
I'm sat there ever for a minute. Okay, you know what? I wish this was a game

3907
06:17:24,200 --> 06:17:26,440
It's just a uh slashy

3908
06:17:27,080 --> 06:17:32,680
It's not a shooter. Where the heck did my refunds go? Oh, there they go. Okay. Thank you for your uh escort

3909
06:17:33,560 --> 06:17:36,840
Yeah, you like that. You like it. You're my escort. Are you squidding me right now?

3910
06:17:38,360 --> 06:17:43,240
This game can be pretty tough. Some of these reflames are just very good at this game

3911
06:17:43,800 --> 06:17:45,800
I myself am just average

3912
06:17:46,760 --> 06:17:49,560
That's okay. You don't have to be mlg pro just to play it

3913
06:17:50,440 --> 06:17:51,240
Hey

3914
06:17:51,240 --> 06:17:53,240
Stash power. Thank you for the support

3915
06:17:55,400 --> 06:17:57,400
No, I'm having fun just looking about

3916
06:17:58,120 --> 06:17:59,880
Oh

3917
06:17:59,880 --> 06:18:01,880
Oh my gosh

3918
06:18:01,880 --> 06:18:03,880
Let's not fall off the map. No darlin

3919
06:18:07,080 --> 06:18:09,080
I was big big boom

3920
06:18:10,760 --> 06:18:12,760
I start I might start another one

3921
06:18:13,640 --> 06:18:15,640
Ah

3922
06:18:15,880 --> 06:18:17,880
Wrong don't do that again

3923
06:18:20,040 --> 06:18:22,040
Portion don't waste it

3924
06:18:23,160 --> 06:18:25,160
Don't waste the potion

3925
06:18:25,720 --> 06:18:30,040
No, you don't want to waste the potion. Are we about to do a battle dumb?

3926
06:18:37,880 --> 06:18:42,600
No, I like easier games though. I'd say I'm definitely average gamer too. I just like clean

3927
06:18:44,360 --> 06:18:46,360
Oh

3928
06:18:58,600 --> 06:19:03,960
Like if that feels that it's like the restocking on supermarket simulator

3929
06:19:04,120 --> 06:19:07,000
It's satisfying and I'm not going to argue against it. I'm

3930
06:19:07,800 --> 06:19:09,000
I

3931
06:19:09,000 --> 06:19:16,440
Although I have to admit this sword is so big that I sometimes think I've accidentally got a bro and arrow out like in skyrim

3932
06:19:17,800 --> 06:19:19,800
Sure, I'll pick up one of you. Oh, no, I didn't do that

3933
06:19:20,680 --> 06:19:22,680
I want that one. I'm just picking it up. I'll pick

3934
06:19:26,840 --> 06:19:28,840
We're at a blood camp

3935
06:19:30,040 --> 06:19:34,520
But are we going to survive is the question drum roll

3936
06:19:37,000 --> 06:19:42,200
Games are way more fun when you don't take them too few. Yeah, I've definitely been enjoying that

3937
06:19:44,680 --> 06:19:49,240
That's right. I did a 360 drink the ale pick up the

3938
06:19:51,720 --> 06:19:53,720
All right, where's the boss fight bring him on

3939
06:19:55,240 --> 06:19:59,960
Bring on the boat. Oh, no right in front of me though. Well, that was cheeky don't do that

3940
06:20:00,200 --> 06:20:02,200
Let's go

3941
06:20:05,000 --> 06:20:08,360
How did you spawn that freaking tree and honestly

3942
06:20:11,720 --> 06:20:15,720
I don't know what I'm supposed to whack at everything saying he's armored up the wazoo

3943
06:20:16,360 --> 06:20:20,360
That just keeps going for it. Or is there a weak spot I need to go for?

3944
06:20:21,480 --> 06:20:23,480
He's not got a head

3945
06:20:30,120 --> 06:20:32,120
He didn't have it

3946
06:20:34,280 --> 06:20:38,680
Yep, if you guys are happy, I'm happy. I don't understand what occurred in that fight

3947
06:20:40,120 --> 06:20:46,280
I think the best thing about this game is that every class is viable even at higher difficulty to get to a lot of different play styles

3948
06:20:47,960 --> 06:20:49,960
I just see

3949
06:20:50,840 --> 06:20:57,320
They yelled out for wasting supplies. I'm sorry. Oh, we know I need to take this one so I can heal the reasons because I can't heal them with a drop

3950
06:20:57,880 --> 06:21:06,120
All heavy attacks pierce armor. Okay. I'm blunt blunt blood bludgering him today

3951
06:21:09,080 --> 06:21:12,760
I don't ever use that word. So that was that that was hard on the tongue

3952
06:21:15,000 --> 06:21:17,000
What's whispering

3953
06:21:19,000 --> 06:21:21,000
Sassy bucka. Oh, I found the stairs

3954
06:21:21,000 --> 06:21:23,000
Let's go across

3955
06:21:24,520 --> 06:21:28,280
I'm going up the stairs. I'm exploring up the stairs

3956
06:21:29,560 --> 06:21:34,520
We're supposed to return to the gate now, but there's no aggro to it's just

3957
06:21:41,800 --> 06:21:43,800
Blood joining yeah

3958
06:21:44,760 --> 06:21:46,760
Like when it's a blunt attack

3959
06:21:47,880 --> 06:21:50,200
Like a hammer is considered blunt, right?

3960
06:21:51,400 --> 06:21:53,400
So

3961
06:21:53,800 --> 06:21:55,800
He is so weak to

3962
06:21:55,880 --> 06:21:57,880
shoot in attacks like that

3963
06:21:58,520 --> 06:22:00,120
Where we're going?

3964
06:22:00,120 --> 06:22:02,120
Don't this me

3965
06:22:02,760 --> 06:22:04,760
And is it through a game?

3966
06:22:08,920 --> 06:22:10,920
Enking him to death

3967
06:22:11,160 --> 06:22:13,160
I

3968
06:22:16,120 --> 06:22:21,880
Wonder if I had a if I was in a video game that would be my attack because I'm a cold fish

3969
06:22:21,960 --> 06:22:23,960
So obviously I can ink like that

3970
06:22:24,360 --> 06:22:31,480
Uh, I get and like if you upgraded my ink, I guess it would be like it takes over your mind and breaks you type thing

3971
06:22:32,600 --> 06:22:34,600
Oh

3972
06:22:35,560 --> 06:22:39,800
I get stronger and stronger until you like can't resist it every time you level it up

3973
06:22:39,960 --> 06:22:43,800
And then like at the point there's like no enemies that are mean to me because I'm so

3974
06:22:44,600 --> 06:22:46,600
I'm so

3975
06:22:46,600 --> 06:22:51,080
I'm so ink. Okay. That's my sentence. Thank you everyone. I'll wrap up the stream there. I'm so ink

3976
06:22:51,880 --> 06:22:53,880
I'm so ink

3977
06:22:54,280 --> 06:22:56,760
Baby, you stole my heart up. I'm so

3978
06:23:00,040 --> 06:23:02,040
We can go back to the gate

3979
06:23:04,600 --> 06:23:06,600
And

3980
06:23:09,400 --> 06:23:11,400
Aggressively inked on you

3981
06:23:12,760 --> 06:23:16,440
Why do that in game when you can do it and realize me first me first?

3982
06:23:17,720 --> 06:23:19,880
Okay, I line up one by one. You're all getting inked on

3983
06:23:22,520 --> 06:23:26,600
Oh, we beat it up. Oh, I like that. I want to beat up all of them

3984
06:23:26,840 --> 06:23:28,840
I

3985
06:23:31,880 --> 06:23:37,720
Actually like the lore that they can't like come to an agreement and they're so smart that they sabotage themselves

3986
06:23:38,760 --> 06:23:40,760
Over like silliness. I quite like that

3987
06:23:41,800 --> 06:23:43,800
That's good

3988
06:23:50,920 --> 06:23:52,920
I'm helping I'm helping

3989
06:23:56,600 --> 06:23:59,720
Uh, am I getting gas?

3990
06:24:02,200 --> 06:24:04,200
Whoa, what's going on?

3991
06:24:08,120 --> 06:24:10,120
Okay, everyone close your eyes

3992
06:24:14,520 --> 06:24:16,520
Uh, are they stuck?

3993
06:24:17,080 --> 06:24:19,080
I'm

3994
06:24:24,600 --> 06:24:26,600
I'm protected

3995
06:24:27,400 --> 06:24:31,240
I'm pretty abandoned them a lot of enemies spawn behind

3996
06:24:33,160 --> 06:24:37,800
I'm not gonna abandon the people the only reason I got this far into the game

3997
06:24:39,160 --> 06:24:44,120
Ready, let's go right close your eyes though because it's so blending to the same thing

3998
06:24:44,840 --> 06:24:46,840
I didn't even notice there was like

3999
06:24:57,240 --> 06:25:02,600
Wait, whoa, why did she sound so slow? Did the voiceline mess up?

4000
06:25:09,160 --> 06:25:11,160
I refuse to close my eyes

4001
06:25:14,840 --> 06:25:16,840
Oh, it's the rat from the star

4002
06:25:26,920 --> 06:25:34,360
Oh my god, they're a jewel. Oh, that's not good. How are you supposed to win? I look like uh, I um

4003
06:25:36,840 --> 06:25:38,840
Oh

4004
06:25:44,600 --> 06:25:49,640
Oh my gosh, that's like annihilation

4005
06:25:54,200 --> 06:25:56,200
Ow

4006
06:25:56,200 --> 06:25:58,840
I literally can't even get close to him to wall of him

4007
06:26:00,520 --> 06:26:02,520
Ow

4008
06:26:05,480 --> 06:26:09,240
Uh, oh, I'm getting pushed. I'm getting I'm

4009
06:26:09,400 --> 06:26:11,400
Oh

4010
06:26:11,720 --> 06:26:15,480
What's going on? I literally can't do anything. Okay, you're up

4011
06:26:20,440 --> 06:26:25,720
Uh, sorry, I suck right now. I'm like doing so bad. I don't really

4012
06:26:29,000 --> 06:26:36,440
Okay, okay, okay, it's fine. It's fine. Everything's fine. Go panic. Did we kill him? I'm just spanking him

4013
06:26:39,560 --> 06:26:43,400
I am kind of fuzzled. I think

4014
06:26:50,840 --> 06:26:54,520
Can I melee him? I can okay, so get rekt, bro

4015
06:27:01,640 --> 06:27:04,600
Uh, I don't even know if I can reach him in time

4016
06:27:05,400 --> 06:27:07,400
I'm impressed

4017
06:27:08,920 --> 06:27:10,920
What is going on

4018
06:27:15,400 --> 06:27:18,840
I'm trying. I don't know if he's even taken any damage

4019
06:27:22,200 --> 06:27:23,880
Ow

4020
06:27:23,880 --> 06:27:30,120
Okay, thank goodness I have heals, but I have a terrible feeling if we weren't playing on easy mode right now

4021
06:27:30,200 --> 06:27:32,200
I'd be a goner

4022
06:27:33,160 --> 06:27:40,520
Okay, I'm staying in this corner because he keeps teleporting to every other corner. I this is my corner. I'm gonna attack him when it shows up

4023
06:27:43,000 --> 06:27:45,000
He's literally going mental

4024
06:27:46,360 --> 06:27:49,800
Every corner but the one that I want to attack him in basically

4025
06:27:52,040 --> 06:27:54,200
You have to dodge while blocking

4026
06:27:54,440 --> 06:28:01,800
Everybody's staying one corner. I agree with that

4027
06:28:06,840 --> 06:28:08,840
Uh

4028
06:28:17,320 --> 06:28:20,360
Oh, and he spawns in my corner the moment I look away for five seconds

4029
06:28:21,240 --> 06:28:25,400
I see how it is. I see how it is. You wait for I'm one of you

4030
06:28:28,360 --> 06:28:30,360
Watch out

4031
06:28:32,840 --> 06:28:38,200
Yeah, higher difficulty a single poke from a random rat is like 50 HP. Bruh, I don't know why

4032
06:28:39,160 --> 06:28:42,760
I'm a bit nervous to play the harder modes after this

4033
06:28:45,000 --> 06:28:47,000
This is my corner you may not like it

4034
06:28:51,080 --> 06:28:53,080
I

4035
06:28:57,400 --> 06:28:59,400
Did it I did it I hit him

4036
06:29:09,640 --> 06:29:15,640
The back stabbing and legendary mode is here I'd imagine so literally like if you can't even see

4037
06:29:20,680 --> 06:29:22,680
Oh

4038
06:29:23,000 --> 06:29:25,560
Okay, I like how they're that's his finishing move

4039
06:29:39,960 --> 06:29:41,960
We did it

4040
06:29:45,720 --> 06:29:47,720
We destroyed one enemy

4041
06:29:50,680 --> 06:29:54,440
Okay, things are blowing up not to be dramatic, but let's get move on

4042
06:29:55,640 --> 06:29:57,640
Am I going the wrong way?

4043
06:29:57,640 --> 06:29:59,640
No, I'm not

4044
06:30:01,080 --> 06:30:03,080
Getting too bit too hard

4045
06:30:05,320 --> 06:30:08,040
I hit from the 7 of 40

4046
06:30:10,200 --> 06:30:15,960
I've no idea how the HP values work. I guess I'm like what 100 HP

4047
06:30:16,840 --> 06:30:21,960
I almost fell off the map there. He's feeling poor

4048
06:30:24,360 --> 06:30:29,000
A little to the right a little to the right. I like to move. I like to

4049
06:30:33,000 --> 06:30:35,000
Hey, okay

4050
06:30:35,400 --> 06:30:37,400
You

4051
06:30:45,640 --> 06:30:48,040
Okay, we can do it we can do it

4052
06:30:51,800 --> 06:30:57,320
Oh my god, we did it your character class is 125

4053
06:31:00,200 --> 06:31:03,000
I'm not winning on any other level

4054
06:31:05,960 --> 06:31:07,960
Or did I just miss it?

4055
06:31:14,440 --> 06:31:21,560
Oh, there's more oh, I just said escape, okay, uh the wayward stone would be nice

4056
06:31:26,600 --> 06:31:29,400
Uh, we're putting a lot of faith into this

4057
06:31:30,360 --> 06:31:32,360
That which was

4058
06:31:32,840 --> 06:31:34,840
Get me on that wayward stone

4059
06:31:35,960 --> 06:31:39,240
Oh my gosh. All right, hold on. Let me let me hit him. What pose?

4060
06:31:41,320 --> 06:31:44,600
I did it. I got an achievement

4061
06:31:46,680 --> 06:31:50,600
Yay, we finished it. We destroyed this getter gate

4062
06:31:52,680 --> 06:31:58,760
Oh my god, I get anything special for it. Come on. Give me something special. Did the main boss come on. Give it to me

4063
06:32:00,200 --> 06:32:03,240
You know, I deserve it. You know, I did it

4064
06:32:08,200 --> 06:32:11,080
Peasant box my spoils of war

4065
06:32:12,680 --> 06:32:14,680
You chest up

4066
06:32:17,480 --> 06:32:20,280
Ran Ranold's gift who's ran old

4067
06:32:22,520 --> 06:32:24,520
And why is he giving me again?

4068
06:32:25,480 --> 06:32:28,760
That's a good pup throwing it. No, I'm getting out not yet

4069
06:32:31,320 --> 06:32:33,880
I did it. I did something

4070
06:32:37,880 --> 06:32:45,240
No way on my last friend I did something to actually help my team. I wasn't an anchor

4071
06:32:47,400 --> 06:32:52,440
Oh, yeah, I wasn't an anchor. I wasn't an anchor

4072
06:32:54,600 --> 06:32:58,200
MVP most valuable player. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be here all day

4073
06:32:59,240 --> 06:33:01,240
Uh, right. Okay

4074
06:33:02,520 --> 06:33:05,640
Okay, here's the agendination. We're gonna keep playing

4075
06:33:06,680 --> 06:33:10,280
Uh, we're gonna muck about on harder difficulties

4076
06:33:10,680 --> 06:33:15,240
Not for too long though, because I'm a bit sweepy, but I'm gonna quickly go for a pee. Is that okay?

4077
06:33:15,480 --> 06:33:22,040
You're the real MVP moment. I carried that game. Oh, yeah. Uh, I carried that game

4078
06:33:25,400 --> 06:33:31,240
Okay, I'm gonna very quickly go for a peep. I recommend everyone else also goes for a peep as well

4079
06:33:35,000 --> 06:33:37,000
It is so good head pass

4080
06:33:38,920 --> 06:33:40,920
Uh, yes, yes, yes. Um

4081
06:33:41,720 --> 06:33:45,800
I goodnight moment. Are you gonna bed rest well refling? Thank you for hanging

4082
06:33:46,280 --> 06:33:51,480
I'll go for a quick pee and then we'll muck about on harder difficulties whether or not something

4083
06:33:51,880 --> 06:33:54,760
You know, we actually get anything, but it's not gonna be for too long. Okay

4084
06:33:57,720 --> 06:34:01,000
We might be able to redirect. Oh, no, Mercy's not here

4085
06:34:01,960 --> 06:34:04,040
Is there a coming on

4086
06:34:04,040 --> 06:34:06,040
in 30 minutes?

4087
06:34:06,200 --> 06:34:07,240
Um

4088
06:34:07,240 --> 06:34:11,480
Good night. Mommy rest well those who sleep. Thank you so much for hanging and watching the campaign

4089
06:34:12,840 --> 06:34:17,800
Uh, we will do the later mission at another stream sniping team

4090
06:34:19,400 --> 06:34:21,400
um

4091
06:34:21,480 --> 06:34:23,480
Yeah

4092
06:34:23,480 --> 06:34:30,600
Okay, I very quickly go pee and use can squabble amongst yourself among those in but uh

4093
06:34:31,320 --> 06:34:34,120
New refling cycle and and I'll be I'll be right back. Okay

4094
06:34:35,400 --> 06:34:38,520
And nope, you can once I go pee the toilet's literally right there

4095
06:34:38,520 --> 06:34:40,520
Mwah

4096
06:34:49,480 --> 06:34:54,920
Do not miss the army life sergeant comrades in arms instead of us

4097
06:35:08,520 --> 06:35:10,520
You

4098
06:35:38,840 --> 06:35:40,840
Oh

4099
06:36:00,360 --> 06:36:04,120
So what's it like having actually heard sigmar's voice

4100
06:36:09,000 --> 06:36:11,000
You

4101
06:36:23,160 --> 06:36:25,160
No

4102
06:36:27,560 --> 06:36:30,920
I went for a pee I tangled in the toilet

4103
06:36:31,800 --> 06:36:37,160
It's going dark. What do you mean? It's going dark. I peed

4104
06:36:39,480 --> 06:36:43,800
Reflin darling my sweet pee you're okay

4105
06:36:45,400 --> 06:36:47,080
What's this?

4106
06:36:47,080 --> 06:36:49,800
Okay, I've got night refling. I don't think I've had

4107
06:36:50,600 --> 06:36:52,600
Oh, no, we haven't had you

4108
06:36:54,200 --> 06:36:56,200
Uh right

4109
06:36:57,080 --> 06:36:59,240
Callie you never had to

4110
06:37:01,640 --> 06:37:05,480
Deus we had you in the last game. Do you want to give another refling a shot?

4111
06:37:05,480 --> 06:37:07,480
Oh

4112
06:37:07,720 --> 06:37:11,720
Oh him in the pose. Oh, oh, oh, he fucking turned around

4113
06:37:13,000 --> 06:37:20,680
It's dark because you peed on us. What my acid pee like took away your optic ability. I said all that matters the first time

4114
06:37:22,520 --> 06:37:24,520
You were gone for so long

4115
06:37:24,760 --> 06:37:26,760
Uh

4116
06:37:30,840 --> 06:37:32,840
Days

4117
06:37:33,640 --> 06:37:40,040
Is anyone okay tell you what move out days, but if no one moves and come back in again the off

4118
06:37:43,880 --> 06:37:45,880
So long

4119
06:37:45,880 --> 06:37:47,320
We'll move back

4120
06:37:47,320 --> 06:37:53,160
Um, I don't know. I forgot as there is actually not that well right now. So I don't know if we'll be redirecting them to

4121
06:37:54,920 --> 06:37:59,400
Um, but we're gonna give hard mode a shot. Whether or not we get her in

4122
06:38:04,760 --> 06:38:07,480
Whoa, that's like way better than what I've got right now

4123
06:38:10,600 --> 06:38:12,600
I don't know that's even there

4124
06:38:14,600 --> 06:38:16,600
Charm

4125
06:38:17,560 --> 06:38:19,560
Power

4126
06:38:21,800 --> 06:38:24,520
I'm sure this probably isn't the best in sports stuff, but

4127
06:38:25,880 --> 06:38:27,880
I'm just I'm the best

4128
06:38:28,360 --> 06:38:30,360
Sorry

4129
06:38:30,360 --> 06:38:32,360
Right and then first dead you've not been in

4130
06:38:35,640 --> 06:38:37,400
Okay, now

4131
06:38:37,400 --> 06:38:38,840
What we are going

4132
06:38:38,840 --> 06:38:41,960
I can do champion easy once the rust is off

4133
06:38:42,920 --> 06:38:46,520
Right, so I was basically going to take us to the start

4134
06:38:47,400 --> 06:38:50,600
And then we're going to attempt champion difficulty. Okay

4135
06:38:53,320 --> 06:38:57,720
And if I get obliterated there's friendly fire and champion

4136
06:39:01,640 --> 06:39:03,640
If there's friendly fire

4137
06:39:04,520 --> 06:39:06,360
That means

4138
06:39:06,360 --> 06:39:08,360
That the biggest threat to

4139
06:39:08,440 --> 06:39:13,960
Like to you guys is me you do realize that right because I'm an idiot and I just swing all the way time

4140
06:39:22,280 --> 06:39:26,680
I'm so gonna absolutely annihilate some leaflings. I'm so sorry

4141
06:39:29,480 --> 06:39:32,120
Only range weapons have friendly fire

4142
06:39:33,800 --> 06:39:35,800
Okay, so maybe it's okay

4143
06:39:39,320 --> 06:39:41,320
Let's see what happens

4144
06:39:50,360 --> 06:39:52,360
I'm getting nervous

4145
06:39:53,560 --> 06:39:55,560
I'm getting nervous

4146
06:39:56,440 --> 06:39:58,600
Okay, it's not easy mode

4147
06:39:59,320 --> 06:40:01,800
Pay attention use blocks

4148
06:40:03,000 --> 06:40:05,400
They put it in the game for a reason. Okay

4149
06:40:06,200 --> 06:40:09,320
They put block in the game for a reason

4150
06:40:11,880 --> 06:40:13,880
They put it in the game for a reason

4151
06:40:14,280 --> 06:40:17,880
So use that reason that the dev team put it in the game

4152
06:40:19,480 --> 06:40:23,480
Okay, and we're not to get lost. Okay. I'm not to get lost

4153
06:40:27,560 --> 06:40:30,360
I'm not lost. I'm not lost the leaflings are here

4154
06:40:31,320 --> 06:40:33,000
focus

4155
06:40:33,000 --> 06:40:35,000
Use the block if you need it. Oh

4156
06:40:36,760 --> 06:40:38,760
I'm so nervous

4157
06:40:39,640 --> 06:40:41,880
No, no not happening

4158
06:40:48,120 --> 06:40:50,120
Oh shit, I'm shooting at you

4159
06:40:53,080 --> 06:40:57,080
Okay, I'm helping I promise I'm helping

4160
06:40:57,800 --> 06:40:59,800
I

4161
06:41:04,920 --> 06:41:07,480
I don't know. I'm so nervous

4162
06:41:10,840 --> 06:41:17,640
I'm like both locked in and not locked in at the same time because I've just accepted that I'm rubbish at this game

4163
06:41:18,840 --> 06:41:20,840
I think we're okay

4164
06:41:21,080 --> 06:41:25,960
I'm not fully leveled up. So if we lose I'm gonna blame it and not being fully leveled up game

4165
06:41:27,560 --> 06:41:29,560
But we are if we're together

4166
06:41:29,800 --> 06:41:31,800
leaflings strong together

4167
06:41:32,520 --> 06:41:35,880
And relax the leaflings are within but actually though

4168
06:41:36,840 --> 06:41:38,840
I just intimidated by the game

4169
06:41:41,480 --> 06:41:46,040
I seem to be doing okay, and I have to remember we don't have to deal with the totem as well

4170
06:41:47,480 --> 06:41:50,600
Out well, I just got walloped that was being done

4171
06:41:52,920 --> 06:41:54,920
Oh

4172
06:41:55,800 --> 06:42:02,840
Uh, I'm guessing healing is so scarce. There's like don't even use it until you're like first home here

4173
06:42:03,000 --> 06:42:06,120
No, hike too. We're not we're not doing tomes

4174
06:42:08,280 --> 06:42:12,040
We're not doing tomes because I can hardly keep myself alive. Okay. I'm too dumb for this

4175
06:42:14,040 --> 06:42:17,000
Being rubberous or something is the first step to almost being good at it

4176
06:42:25,880 --> 06:42:27,880
Good thing I have good thing

4177
06:42:29,800 --> 06:42:31,800
Sure, I'll take it if they aren't

4178
06:42:39,400 --> 06:42:45,960
Oh my god, I don't know how you took that down. He was there once saying don't go on the next you can do it

4179
06:42:48,120 --> 06:42:52,600
Have no fear we've seen fear that was a nice block until I immediately messed up again

4180
06:42:53,560 --> 06:42:57,000
Okay, okay. Reeflings have taken that. That's good

4181
06:43:00,040 --> 06:43:02,040
Shit don't mind if I do

4182
06:43:09,400 --> 06:43:15,000
I'm missing all my shots. Okay, let's get the weapons out. Let's get the melee out

4183
06:43:16,520 --> 06:43:19,320
Use the block when you need to

4184
06:43:20,120 --> 06:43:22,680
Use the block when you need to

4185
06:43:27,160 --> 06:43:29,560
I assume I was supposed to do that

4186
06:43:30,680 --> 06:43:33,320
Stop taking out a potion to attack an enemy

4187
06:43:41,160 --> 06:43:47,000
Oh, I'm just trying to say swipe them the now. Oh, they have so much more hp

4188
06:43:50,120 --> 06:43:52,120
Oh

4189
06:43:53,160 --> 06:43:56,200
I'm side swiping. I'm side swiping. I'm side swiping

4190
06:43:58,200 --> 06:44:03,880
Oh dear, I'm getting a bollocking in the back. Hold on. Are we done here?

4191
06:44:05,560 --> 06:44:11,400
Are we to go up survive until the gate opens? Okay, the gate hasn't opened yet, so I can just stay here swinging

4192
06:44:12,760 --> 06:44:17,800
Where the gate gets here or do we want to sit by the gate? I'm sitting by the gate. Is that allowed?

4193
06:44:20,120 --> 06:44:22,120
Oh

4194
06:44:27,880 --> 06:44:29,880
No

4195
06:44:35,000 --> 06:44:37,000
Come on

4196
06:44:38,920 --> 06:44:43,480
Right, put that gun away. Put it away. Stop it. Stop it. Stop this medicine

4197
06:44:44,120 --> 06:44:50,680
Ah, I was gonna pick you up. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I suck so bad

4198
06:44:51,720 --> 06:44:54,520
I can't even get to you right. I can pick you up now

4199
06:44:57,160 --> 06:44:59,820
Okay, up the stairs which go up the stairs

4200
06:45:03,880 --> 06:45:08,440
Okay, where'd you go up the stairs up the stairs you guys can use voice chat by the way

4201
06:45:08,920 --> 06:45:10,920
Are you guys have better comms than Oliver?

4202
06:45:13,560 --> 06:45:15,560
I was distracted by the blight storm

4203
06:45:21,080 --> 06:45:24,440
Not the brap tornado. No, because it actually is as well

4204
06:45:26,280 --> 06:45:28,920
If you press left down or right you dodge

4205
06:45:43,480 --> 06:45:46,840
Bombs here, let's hope the black powder inside is

4206
06:45:49,000 --> 06:45:57,800
If I die, is it like ogre ogre or is it just like the three of them have to continue without me?

4207
06:46:07,160 --> 06:46:09,160
They can rescue you later, okay

4208
06:46:14,280 --> 06:46:16,280
Ooh, I don't like the look of him

4209
06:46:24,360 --> 06:46:26,360
Okay

4210
06:46:26,920 --> 06:46:28,920
Whoo

4211
06:46:29,080 --> 06:46:31,080
Rather scary

4212
06:46:32,600 --> 06:46:36,280
I just hope my blunt attack isn't off. I do I really do

4213
06:46:39,240 --> 06:46:41,240
Fucking get me up there and I'm faking it

4214
06:46:43,480 --> 06:46:45,480
You respawn after about okay

4215
06:46:46,440 --> 06:46:50,120
I wondered that because one of the trinkets was like yeah, but a faster respawn

4216
06:46:50,200 --> 06:46:53,480
But I was like it's not like fortnite when you can call in the wee battle bus

4217
06:47:03,480 --> 06:47:05,480
Wow

4218
06:47:06,680 --> 06:47:11,640
Uh the dwarf reflin is currently berserking right now. He's on his own

4219
06:47:13,800 --> 06:47:15,800
Okay

4220
06:47:18,120 --> 06:47:23,480
Okay, it's fine. It's fine. We're doing okay. Honestly all things considered

4221
06:47:25,640 --> 06:47:29,080
Uh, I think this really needs to be cushioned

4222
06:47:30,360 --> 06:47:35,240
If you want to take it from me. Oh no, you've got you've got a book on them

4223
06:47:39,240 --> 06:47:41,240
Oh no way that didn't kill him

4224
06:47:44,440 --> 06:47:46,440
Yeah

4225
06:47:48,120 --> 06:47:50,120
Wow

4226
06:47:55,000 --> 06:47:57,000
Grabbing

4227
06:48:02,760 --> 06:48:05,080
Uh grab our room there's a book here

4228
06:48:05,160 --> 06:48:07,160
Oh

4229
06:48:11,720 --> 06:48:16,360
Wait that reflin's gonna get one. Is he gonna be okay?

4230
06:48:20,120 --> 06:48:22,120
I don't know if he's gonna get overrun

4231
06:48:23,800 --> 06:48:26,280
My blunt attack is when I smoke and blow that's okay

4232
06:48:29,240 --> 06:48:32,760
It's normal to die on higher levels don't worry too much about it. Okay

4233
06:48:35,400 --> 06:48:37,800
I'm just swinging in case something happens, you know

4234
06:48:39,720 --> 06:48:41,720
You seem to have got it

4235
06:48:43,000 --> 06:48:45,000
She be

4236
06:48:45,000 --> 06:48:47,000
She sent us to scrawny you fools

4237
06:48:47,800 --> 06:48:52,840
I said she be stream go. What was she up to madam the deceiver?

4238
06:48:58,440 --> 06:49:02,440
All right, what does she say we've been lied to by madam was that mistake

4239
06:49:05,640 --> 06:49:07,640
I

4240
06:49:08,360 --> 06:49:14,440
She be in her room. Thank you for the reader. Right. She smacked her Tamagotchi chair give it a spanking

4241
06:49:16,440 --> 06:49:18,760
I remember my Tamagotchi died and pretty much

4242
06:49:19,400 --> 06:49:24,520
Thanks to take it and then I used to say the teacher. I need both the toilet and I'd go feed it during school

4243
06:49:26,600 --> 06:49:28,600
That's a cheeky thing oh

4244
06:49:30,200 --> 06:49:32,200
I almost got done I almost got done in

4245
06:49:35,080 --> 06:49:37,080
Okay, that's why you swing

4246
06:49:49,400 --> 06:49:52,440
We're currently playing a game called vermin tight 2

4247
06:49:53,240 --> 06:49:55,240
And for stream sniping

4248
06:49:55,800 --> 06:50:01,800
Uh, I've made a new steam account so we can play a ton of more games together without having to worry about anything

4249
06:50:02,760 --> 06:50:04,760
Um, let's skip the grims for today

4250
06:50:06,120 --> 06:50:10,440
Yeah, I think for this map, um, we finished the first campaign mode

4251
06:50:10,440 --> 06:50:16,200
We are going to be playing vermin tight 2 at a later date to finish finish all the default content

4252
06:50:16,760 --> 06:50:18,920
Obviously, they've got dlc content

4253
06:50:20,760 --> 06:50:23,720
Which I'm not going to be buying because I already bought the base price of the game

4254
06:50:24,680 --> 06:50:26,680
but um

4255
06:50:26,760 --> 06:50:31,720
Yeah, I've just been playing my refunds for almost seven hours. I'm talking about we're playing

4256
06:50:33,160 --> 06:50:36,920
I didn't save properly. I'm sorry. Runs away in tears

4257
06:50:38,280 --> 06:50:40,280
Save what? I'm so confused

4258
06:50:42,760 --> 06:50:45,000
Did the Tamagotchi profit sweet cloth?

4259
06:50:48,200 --> 06:50:50,200
Oh, right I'm not doing that

4260
06:50:53,000 --> 06:50:55,000
No, I'm blocking

4261
06:50:55,400 --> 06:50:57,960
No, I don't think I have the stamina for this

4262
06:51:00,200 --> 06:51:02,760
You can play dlc as long as the host owns that

4263
06:51:03,720 --> 06:51:06,360
That's okay shibi. We love you no matter what. This is true

4264
06:51:10,200 --> 06:51:13,240
You only played the first campaign, there's still three others on yes

4265
06:51:13,400 --> 06:51:17,240
I'm going to play them with uh, the next time we stream snipe

4266
06:51:17,320 --> 06:51:20,840
I'll pick a different game, but like in the future we'll play this game again. Um

4267
06:51:21,000 --> 06:51:23,000
Um

4268
06:51:23,320 --> 06:51:25,320
You'll get there

4269
06:51:29,000 --> 06:51:30,440
Wow

4270
06:51:30,440 --> 06:51:33,560
We're playing champions mode, which means everything's a lot

4271
06:51:34,200 --> 06:51:36,200
meaner and not as nice to us

4272
06:51:37,160 --> 06:51:39,400
and I am trying to

4273
06:51:40,120 --> 06:51:45,080
Not die basically, but everyone's really not feeling well. Do you want this healing potion?

4274
06:51:45,880 --> 06:51:48,440
I can give you it. I don't know how to drop it

4275
06:51:49,400 --> 06:51:51,400
Oh, I just used the ultimate

4276
06:51:52,840 --> 06:51:55,640
I'm a wasted ultimate. Have fun reeflings

4277
06:51:57,000 --> 06:51:58,840
You get them

4278
06:51:58,840 --> 06:52:01,320
Right, someone take that and then someone heal with that potion

4279
06:52:04,520 --> 06:52:07,800
Okay, I have the book

4280
06:52:12,280 --> 06:52:14,680
I've got a go and I have a fun hang out. Good luck. Thank you

4281
06:52:18,920 --> 06:52:21,320
I don't know why I didn't react to that at all

4282
06:52:25,160 --> 06:52:27,160
Thank you, thank you

4283
06:52:31,720 --> 06:52:35,400
He won't trouble us no more. Yes, I will whack them with the book. Why not?

4284
06:52:38,600 --> 06:52:40,600
Me

4285
06:52:41,560 --> 06:52:46,600
It's our treachery finale of pelish on champions. Wait the ending to this one

4286
06:52:48,760 --> 06:52:50,760
Have I picked the worst map to do this?

4287
06:53:02,120 --> 06:53:09,560
I mean I gave him a wall at the best I could. All right, there we go. I guess we just keep going we keep moving

4288
06:53:11,080 --> 06:53:13,160
I'm moving I'm going

4289
06:53:21,480 --> 06:53:23,880
Look at all that temporary HP P though

4290
06:53:25,240 --> 06:53:27,240
I'm absolutely getting it

4291
06:53:28,440 --> 06:53:31,960
Terror of treachery is another map. Okay, tiki. Thank god

4292
06:53:33,000 --> 06:53:37,640
Surely the first game is the easiest to win on champions

4293
06:53:41,160 --> 06:53:43,160
I

4294
06:53:48,760 --> 06:53:54,440
I'm chopping I'm chopping I have extra damage against those who are knocked down

4295
06:53:59,000 --> 06:54:01,000
Oh, sorry

4296
06:54:01,640 --> 06:54:07,480
I forgot I can't shoot through teammates. I'm sorry. I just walloped him

4297
06:54:08,280 --> 06:54:11,880
I was like, oh that's strange. I've never heard him say that voice line before

4298
06:54:12,680 --> 06:54:17,960
That check your aim one. Yeah, because I literally just shot right through your like flesh and bone

4299
06:54:19,960 --> 06:54:23,960
She V did some turret reading. Mummy is carving a path

4300
06:54:26,920 --> 06:54:28,920
I'm so sorry. I don't know what turret guards mean

4301
06:54:28,920 --> 06:54:39,240
Maybe I shouldn't have opened this right away

4302
06:54:41,880 --> 06:54:46,360
Yeah, it was very nice. Oh, I'm glad you have fun together here. Um

4303
06:54:47,720 --> 06:54:53,080
That's cute. Uh, I don't know if there are as well enough to

4304
06:54:53,800 --> 06:54:55,800
And

4305
06:55:06,280 --> 06:55:10,040
Your weapon does really little friendly fire you would run out of I'm we're killing

4306
06:55:12,200 --> 06:55:14,200
Check your aim

4307
06:55:15,160 --> 06:55:18,440
Like from the painting of well that very I don't want to be mean

4308
06:55:19,160 --> 06:55:22,680
Because if she be genuinely likes that stuff, I'm not gonna be like a thinker about it

4309
06:55:22,680 --> 06:55:24,920
It's just like my only experience is balutro

4310
06:55:25,720 --> 06:55:33,080
And the the binding of Isaac and I went, oh my god, the lover's card. Oh two two red hearts to replenish my health. I'll use it

4311
06:55:33,880 --> 06:55:35,720
Like oh the hermit card. Oh my god

4312
06:55:35,720 --> 06:55:40,520
I can go into the shop for free without using a key the access unless I'm on the first floor like

4313
06:55:43,240 --> 06:55:45,240
Unfortunately, I don't know

4314
06:55:48,440 --> 06:55:54,440
Oh my god, this is a lot I'm trying

4315
06:55:58,120 --> 06:56:00,120
We're half health, that's not bad

4316
06:56:06,520 --> 06:56:12,680
Okay, they're coming behind as well just the one year wee bit. Oh my god, I need reload

4317
06:56:13,480 --> 06:56:15,800
Sorry, that was the worst reload time ever

4318
06:56:18,520 --> 06:56:22,120
Oh, fuck. I don't know where we win

4319
06:56:32,520 --> 06:56:35,880
Okay, right everyone heal up if you need to heal up

4320
06:56:37,880 --> 06:56:41,800
I will hold the book and then someone can hold a med kit

4321
06:56:42,760 --> 06:56:44,760
I really need it

4322
06:56:45,080 --> 06:56:48,920
It's so much more fun when more enemies are on the screen. Did I not just turn into a pixel?

4323
06:56:49,480 --> 06:56:51,880
Because the bitrate can't keep up with all the movement

4324
06:56:56,360 --> 06:56:58,360
She got the lover's card. Oh did I?

4325
06:57:01,240 --> 06:57:07,480
So what I get is my HP gonna go up now because I've not got good HP in real life at the moment

4326
06:57:08,440 --> 06:57:11,160
I love this card. A wild card. Sorry

4327
06:57:12,040 --> 06:57:14,040
A wild card isn't a thing. It's fine

4328
06:57:15,560 --> 06:57:17,800
The bitrate starts to tank when you swing

4329
06:57:19,400 --> 06:57:22,200
Does it? Oh my god, are we staying in this corner?

4330
06:57:22,920 --> 06:57:27,720
Oh my god, they know the strats the reflins know the strats. We're supposed to be in the storm in the corner

4331
06:57:29,880 --> 06:57:33,800
You have two hearts down main angels. Oh, that was so sweet reflin

4332
06:57:34,760 --> 06:57:37,480
All right, hold on. I need to wait. No

4333
06:57:40,600 --> 06:57:42,600
I might protect me my

4334
06:57:45,800 --> 06:57:48,300
Oh, no way we get that no way

4335
06:57:53,960 --> 06:57:55,960
Okay, I'm knocking them on their arses

4336
06:57:58,840 --> 06:58:01,880
Are we supposed to like move up and down here or not really?

4337
06:58:04,280 --> 06:58:06,280
Oh

4338
06:58:08,600 --> 06:58:10,600
I'm stuck in that. I don't know about you guys

4339
06:58:19,480 --> 06:58:21,480
Uh

4340
06:58:22,200 --> 06:58:24,200
Male stress male stress

4341
06:58:25,640 --> 06:58:29,480
Are we not supposed to be in here anymore? I don't know you guys you're moving out. I'm just copying what you do

4342
06:58:30,680 --> 06:58:33,240
You know you're back in here. Okay. I'm back in here too

4343
06:58:33,800 --> 06:58:35,800
I

4344
06:58:36,120 --> 06:58:40,200
We're fine. Just turtle up all like that terminology just hurt a lot

4345
06:58:43,720 --> 06:58:48,280
You haven't saved from it until you see shade milk, uh, chaos form

4346
06:58:50,120 --> 06:58:52,120
What does that mean?

4347
06:58:54,840 --> 06:58:57,880
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, uh, something's happening

4348
06:58:59,480 --> 06:59:01,960
I can't read I can't see I can't see

4349
06:59:04,120 --> 06:59:07,240
I can't see I can't help. I can't do anything

4350
06:59:09,080 --> 06:59:11,400
It's all coming apart. I need my replays

4351
06:59:15,720 --> 06:59:17,720
Oh my gosh, please

4352
06:59:18,520 --> 06:59:20,520
Oh, thank god, you guys don't suck

4353
06:59:22,440 --> 06:59:26,200
Thank god, you guys are actually good at this game because I know what sure is heli

4354
06:59:26,920 --> 06:59:28,920
I

4355
06:59:31,880 --> 06:59:34,200
I'm just staying underneath. Okay. I can't

4356
06:59:40,600 --> 06:59:48,200
I'm just staying underneath. I'm a good little streamer. I listen to what they're gonna tell me

4357
06:59:56,280 --> 06:59:59,720
I can't see him

4358
07:00:02,760 --> 07:00:04,760
You can't see any of the enemies for that

4359
07:00:09,160 --> 07:00:11,720
Shit they all have shielded up

4360
07:00:16,440 --> 07:00:18,440
Okay, every look nice

4361
07:00:19,560 --> 07:00:25,400
How long is this section? I don't want to survive, but I'm getting nervous because

4362
07:00:26,840 --> 07:00:28,840
I

4363
07:00:29,240 --> 07:00:31,720
The beacons are lit scrawny poles for eight. I

4364
07:00:36,360 --> 07:00:38,360
Oh

4365
07:00:41,080 --> 07:00:45,800
Uh, I'm going back in the corner. I think I don't know

4366
07:00:47,720 --> 07:00:49,720
Is that up yet?

4367
07:00:50,680 --> 07:00:52,680
Am I going in the corner? I don't know

4368
07:00:53,480 --> 07:00:59,000
Ah, they're spawning in our corner. What the heck? Oh, do we prevent them from spawning right there for here?

4369
07:01:00,120 --> 07:01:02,120
Hey, we were here first

4370
07:01:02,520 --> 07:01:06,440
Literally kids game. We were first back off. This is our spot, man

4372
07:01:10,360 --> 07:01:12,360
I assume that's it done

4373
07:01:12,680 --> 07:01:14,680
Since you guys are out here

4374
07:01:14,680 --> 07:01:16,680
Oh

4375
07:01:22,120 --> 07:01:28,760
My god, we did it that was so stressful never again. That was so stressful. I'm just working to like

4376
07:01:32,040 --> 07:01:35,400
Oh my god, we did it gambasie

4377
07:01:37,560 --> 07:01:42,860
It's like halo reach survive until you die that was terrifying

4378
07:01:45,640 --> 07:01:52,200
Crazy I was crazy one. I was in the corner a rubber corner fell to scaven and scaven's made me crazy crazy

4379
07:01:54,040 --> 07:01:56,040
I might fell so badly

4380
07:01:56,680 --> 07:01:58,440
Thank you

I think I have time

4384
07:02:10,120 --> 07:02:13,240
Wait unless the zero is up. I think the zero is not well

4385
07:02:24,840 --> 07:02:30,120
Oh, she's up. Okay. No, I take it back. I think this is oh, did I do anything?

4386
07:02:31,080 --> 07:02:37,720
Headshots 183 by accident. Okay. We did it. We completed one champion and all of that

4387
07:02:38,520 --> 07:02:43,560
Right, so what I'll do I'm now going to unfriend you all live right in front of your face

Oh, come on. I'm not that bad at steam. I'm uh

4418
07:05:02,840 --> 07:05:04,840
Right click

4419
07:05:06,680 --> 07:05:08,680
Congratulations

4420
07:05:09,480 --> 07:05:16,280
Congratulations little seaweed on beating the game and becoming a blooming tide champion trophy more

4421
07:05:17,000 --> 07:05:20,120
You know, why the heck is my why are my

4422
07:05:22,280 --> 07:05:24,280
My little

4423
07:05:27,640 --> 07:05:29,640
Why are my stuff I was gonna cut off?

4424
07:05:30,760 --> 07:05:36,600
I'm cutting them off. Thank you tyrian chain. It was so good. I really enjoyed it

4425
07:05:37,560 --> 07:05:39,560
Oh my god, this is taking me forever

4426
07:05:48,920 --> 07:05:50,920
You profile

4427
07:05:51,320 --> 07:05:55,880
Loading click the three dots unfriend remove friend. Okay close

4428
07:05:57,080 --> 07:05:59,080
Open view profile

4429
07:06:00,040 --> 07:06:04,520
I'm like, oh my god, if it's a through the account, can I just not do this?

4430
07:06:04,520 --> 07:06:07,640
But uh, I don't want to create any brain worms. So I respect

4431
07:06:09,080 --> 07:06:11,580
I'm all about the respect

4432
07:06:12,840 --> 07:06:18,120
It's just taking a bit longer than I entered feed. I will redirect into azura

4433
07:06:19,400 --> 07:06:25,640
Um, so just give me a moment and you will be redirected into actual gameplay and not just a black screen and a feature with model

4434
07:06:27,000 --> 07:06:30,840
Don't get me wrong. That can be content, but me

4435
07:06:31,800 --> 07:06:33,800
I'm not like that. I'm born

4436
07:06:34,520 --> 07:06:36,520
Do do do

4437
07:06:41,880 --> 07:06:48,840
Okay, I've almost removed everyone that's offline and hopes that everyone that's online removes me makes this process faster

4438
07:06:50,360 --> 07:06:52,200
um

4439
07:06:52,200 --> 07:06:53,720
Almost

4440
07:06:53,720 --> 07:06:59,240
I unfriended strong different friends the less in the scene have been unfriended. No, don't cry. We flin

4441
07:07:00,200 --> 07:07:04,840
We'll do more stream snipe stuff. As I said, we'll probably do left for dead together because

4442
07:07:05,960 --> 07:07:11,560
Well, you know how I always like oh, I want to play borderlands with vtubers that are endurance

4443
07:07:12,280 --> 07:07:13,480
well

4444
07:07:13,480 --> 07:07:15,480
In the most respectful way

4445
07:07:16,360 --> 07:07:19,480
It's not a problem if I play it with you guys

4446
07:07:20,200 --> 07:07:22,440
because like I can just set a timer

4447
07:07:23,560 --> 07:07:28,280
And then we'll play like an hour and then we swap out and that kind of thing, you know

4448
07:07:29,480 --> 07:07:33,640
So then we can play like all the harder games that I wouldn't originally have like

4449
07:07:33,720 --> 07:07:36,760
It would have been really awkward to play with like other vtubers. You know

4450
07:07:39,480 --> 07:07:45,000
You know, you know, this makes me mummy's gone from projectile vomit. Oh dear

4451
07:07:46,360 --> 07:07:48,360
Um, no dear

4452
07:07:51,000 --> 07:07:54,440
That'll go in right I'm now doing the people who are afk

4453
07:07:54,680 --> 07:07:58,200
So all the people that weren't online and now unfriended now i'm doing afk

4454
07:07:59,000 --> 07:08:02,440
And then i'm doing whoever's in the game because they're highlighted to me right now

4455
07:08:05,960 --> 07:08:07,960
I wonder can your account

4456
07:08:07,960 --> 07:08:13,080
Yeah, no, uh, surely steen wouldn't ban your account because you add people play with them and then remove them

4457
07:08:13,480 --> 07:08:17,960
At the end of the playstation. That doesn't sound like something they would report as like suspicious community

4458
07:08:18,280 --> 07:08:20,360
suspicious like activity on an account, right?

4459
07:08:20,520 --> 07:08:22,520
So

4460
07:08:22,840 --> 07:08:24,280
Um

4461
07:08:24,280 --> 07:08:31,560
Someone's called super awesome friendable reef link. Did you just change that stuff when from maybe as a friend

4462
07:08:32,360 --> 07:08:38,680
As there is like yes, she is I am redirecting into her successfully on a moment. That's really funny

4463
07:08:39,880 --> 07:08:41,880
and

4464
07:08:42,520 --> 07:08:44,760
But yes, I think we'll be able to

4465
07:08:46,120 --> 07:08:48,120
and

4466
07:08:48,280 --> 07:08:54,280
Play more difficult games like I think borderlands 2 is much better for stream sniping than it is like play a series of

4467
07:08:55,240 --> 07:08:57,240
are kind of

4468
07:08:59,640 --> 07:09:04,920
I am aware that when you watch a collaboration stream, it's it's hard to

4469
07:09:06,040 --> 07:09:08,040
interact to talk to

4470
07:09:09,640 --> 07:09:11,640
You know be a part of it because you're kind of

4471
07:09:12,920 --> 07:09:14,680
You're watching it more than you are into

4472
07:09:14,760 --> 07:09:19,560
Well, like when it's like a one-on-one stream a more personal stream type thing that is

4473
07:09:22,600 --> 07:09:23,880
Like

4474
07:09:23,880 --> 07:09:25,880
Obviously, I can like you jail the time and

4475
07:09:26,520 --> 07:09:30,280
me monia and all of that whereas like when it's a collab it's

4476
07:09:31,080 --> 07:09:33,080
harder

4477
07:09:33,480 --> 07:09:39,880
Okay, I think I did it. I think I think I did it. Hold on. Let me let me boot the game back up

4478
07:09:40,680 --> 07:09:42,680
Okay, now i'm too big for the game

4479
07:09:45,640 --> 07:09:49,080
Okay, I made myself small but just uh proof

4480
07:09:50,280 --> 07:09:55,400
Uh, I said like two or four people are in here, but I don't know who the hell's in this room because it's just me

4481
07:09:56,040 --> 07:09:58,600
Uh, other than the ghost of Christmas past

4482
07:10:00,120 --> 07:10:02,360
Come on. She unfriended me. Yeah

4483
07:10:03,400 --> 07:10:06,520
But as far as i'm aware that means like no one's

4484
07:10:07,480 --> 07:10:09,480
On the friends list. I don't see anything

4485
07:10:10,600 --> 07:10:12,600
That's the specialist search friends

4486
07:10:14,680 --> 07:10:16,680
The

4487
07:10:18,280 --> 07:10:23,000
The ghost of inking pass. I mean in collabs the chat is a bit left out because it's obviously you have to communicate. Yes

4488
07:10:23,800 --> 07:10:25,800
and like

4489
07:10:25,880 --> 07:10:30,920
I'm probably like after this month. I'm probably just gonna stick to like collabing with the girls. Um

4490
07:10:32,200 --> 07:10:37,560
We all kind of seem to be on the same page for the most. I said she was she was fantastic and there is quite social as well

4491
07:10:38,280 --> 07:10:40,600
Um, she even got rid of the superdifferent

4492
07:10:41,560 --> 07:10:43,240
None of us

4493
07:10:43,240 --> 07:10:49,560
Unfriended again. Nobody loves me. But yeah that just a poof. I ain't doing anything weird in the background

4494
07:10:50,200 --> 07:10:52,200
um

4495
07:10:52,360 --> 07:10:55,400
It was probably me because I left a message on the chat

4496
07:10:59,560 --> 07:11:04,840
I'm unfriended. I'll be back for the next playstation. Yes, we will play this game again. Please don't think

4497
07:11:05,640 --> 07:11:07,640
I'm not playing this game because it

4498
07:11:07,800 --> 07:11:12,040
Uh, I thoroughly enjoyed that. I genuinely did not expect to

4499
07:11:12,680 --> 07:11:18,760
Enjoy it as much as I did and I am so glad that um, I've figured out a way to enable us to stream

4500
07:11:18,760 --> 07:11:20,760
Snipe on these kinds of games as well

4501
07:11:21,160 --> 07:11:27,880
because I have to admit if we were just left to the stream sniping games that are um

4502
07:11:30,040 --> 07:11:32,040
How you call it that are

4503
07:11:32,760 --> 07:11:35,640
Like the lobby code only or like good luck

4504
07:11:35,720 --> 07:11:40,600
We'll all just enter this lobby at the same time and hopefully we all connect like that's it's not easy

4505
07:11:41,000 --> 07:11:43,000
It's not easy doing it that way

4506
07:11:43,560 --> 07:11:47,080
Um, sorry the last group is called the champions. Okay

4507
07:11:48,760 --> 07:11:51,160
Right in order of appearance

4508
07:11:53,640 --> 07:11:58,760
Uh, please don't feel bad if you can't you can stream snipe this time. Are we just having fun? We're having a good time together

4509
07:11:58,760 --> 07:12:00,760
Okay. Oh wait, hold on

4510
07:12:01,400 --> 07:12:04,600
Uh, hold on. What's my layout? Oh, no

4511
07:12:07,800 --> 07:12:09,800
Nope, that's my background theme

4512
07:12:12,360 --> 07:12:14,360
Uh

4513
07:12:15,320 --> 07:12:17,320
Okay, that looks more put together

4514
07:12:18,600 --> 07:12:22,600
Okay, why is the chat messed up at the top thing? Whatever. Um

4515
07:12:23,720 --> 07:12:27,720
Okay, uh, I'll say special. Thank you for everyone that stream sniped if you couldn't stream snipe

4516
07:12:27,720 --> 07:12:32,600
Please don't worry. I like to do stream sniping every week for the most part depending on the situation in case something

4517
07:12:32,600 --> 07:12:39,560
You know comes up. I might not have time. Um, but just to recap on who was helping me through the campaign

4518
07:12:39,960 --> 07:12:41,960
and frog on toast low key

4519
07:12:42,840 --> 07:12:47,400

sama

4540
07:13:39,640 --> 07:13:44,760
I've scribbled out gaping the big wet cave. Oh the splunkers

4541
07:13:44,840 --> 07:13:51,240
Okay, it was the big wet cave and then it became the gaping wet cave and then it became the splunkers that makes more sense

4542
07:13:51,320 --> 07:13:53,320
Okay, um

4543
07:13:53,720 --> 07:14:00,840
And then quest callie and garfunkel were the veterans and then the disconnectors and then they're forgotten because I didn't name these very well

4544
07:14:00,920 --> 07:14:05,160
I'm sorry. Okay, then tiger site stash power

4545
07:14:05,800 --> 07:14:06,600

Uh, the green green red gang because you guys were literally green green and red. She forgot I named them

07:14:18,680 --> 07:14:23,160
Um, and then gazillionaire child demo head empty no thoughts

4551
07:14:23,640 --> 07:14:31,320
You guys were called doko equals coco exclamation mark because mommy doko mommy coco

4552
07:14:32,440 --> 07:14:34,040
Yeah, I'm right here

4553
07:14:34,040 --> 07:14:38,600
Then peppermint stash power and half in you guys were called glake it

4554
07:14:38,600 --> 07:14:41,640
But then you turned into the posers because we all start posing at one point

4555
07:14:42,280 --> 07:14:42,840
um

4556
07:14:42,840 --> 07:14:44,520
vader pt

4557
07:14:44,520 --> 07:14:47,800
lucky moe and salty lemon were called

4558
07:14:49,160 --> 07:14:51,160
dad's lucky citrines

4559
07:14:53,320 --> 07:14:56,360

07:14:56,920 --> 07:15:02,840
Um, it's just called love because I couldn't really figure out anything else. Um, and then deus eggs

4562
07:15:03,240 --> 07:15:04,760
uh, mima sama

4563
07:15:04,760 --> 07:15:06,440

4564
07:15:06,440 --> 07:15:10,680
I've called lenny. Was it lenny? Well, it was lenny. Wasn't that it was

4565
07:15:11,480 --> 07:15:14,840
I'm sure it was am I going crazy? I hope your name done wrong. Um

4566
07:15:16,440 --> 07:15:20,360
And salty lemon no wait wrong wrong

4567
07:15:21,880 --> 07:15:27,640
Lenny and head empty were the experience and then last but certainly not least

4568
07:15:28,520 --> 07:15:34,280
Nate rifling cali and first dead were the champions because you literally made me win as a champion

4569
07:15:34,920 --> 07:15:36,920
And that was our streamstaping event

4570
07:15:37,640 --> 07:15:39,640
We have successfully

4571
07:15:40,520 --> 07:15:42,520
So

4572
07:15:44,680 --> 07:15:52,440
Um, we have successfully done helm guard and next time we play this game, we're gonna play these ones

4573
07:15:53,240 --> 07:15:55,960
Because they're all really super small

4574
07:15:56,840 --> 07:16:01,720
So we could do it all in one go again, and then that'll be our streamstaping adventures on this game

4575
07:16:02,680 --> 07:16:07,000
Unless shot like these dlc's are recommended, but

4576
07:16:08,200 --> 07:16:13,000
I am a bit me if it's dlc like if it ain't in the base game

4577
07:16:13,960 --> 07:16:15,960
okay

4578
07:16:15,960 --> 07:16:19,400
Personally, I like the team that had strongy in it. Thank you rifling

4579
07:16:19,400 --> 07:16:25,080
I enjoyed that team too because all the dreams all the dreams all the teams were a dream to be with

4580
