juicy and dripping and red gushy right excuse you gushy oh i'm like i got two things she can
gush on right now every one says it's very sweet they helped with the watch along
and now they're helping them with a big concert they like to scratch our back we scratch yours
that's why we do it from around these parts you know
memos is a good singer yeah that's actually the most is so talented she is actually got
them lungs on her just hidden you wouldn't realize don't be fooled by the outfit there's
lungs under those straps i know

like i never got girls anything that's okay i was just like that was so it sounds terrible i was
like if i'm not going to use it i'm not giving it to them because i would have showed my end
in screen for like the first time and literally since debut i showed my end in screen and everyone
was laughing which is terrible why do you hate the ending screen so much i i don't like she just
ends she just leaves i don't like star screams that literally if you open up one of my vods i'm
just like me i don't know i literally spent so much money on it i'm just never used the thing
i've never even seen the stingers i never even used stingers on debut that's so much i hate them
as well so i'm showing them the damn god this is fantastic what this is beyond my expectations
my most is amazing she's like an amazing amazing singer multi multi multi talented
extremely things streams uh freaking makes all her own charts as well
thumbnails you name it she does it she does them all you didn't know she sings well i'm supposed

the thing things are jiggling on the screen i don't know if what you guys are looking at but
things are jiggling for me two things are jiggling

thought at the concert let me get let me get two pen lights out i don't have different colors i only
have blue i have so many questions for them that how long this took this is insane i know right
they should just like take the the soundtracks here and just post them as song covers too
honestly that's a smart idea they should i think they will do and that seems
you think they will help so because it's really good they shouldn't just leave it here on the
stream no i want to i want full song covers let those hear your lungs this tiny jellyfish got
lungs on her too god dang
as zura is singing along wiggling my pen lights zura knows the words

very long toes and i'm like sorry you stubbed your toes so much that they're like fucking nubs
but excuse me i have regular toes if you didn't know you're supposed to be able to walk on them

i know same the scenes
oh don't hurt them no don't hurt them no
i also have long toes nothing long i can't wait you can really grip it with those long
toes you know yeah grip what
group songs are much harder to mix together too i mean i feel like it's not hard to mix anything
when it comes to these girls because they just naturally sound perfectly literally the mix
they're speaking voices they're singing voices
stony can clap real good
grip in the grippy stick with my grippers

i don't even know how 3d concerts work i've got a clue how do you gotta ask v4 mariah about that
yeah i need insider knowledge come on lads put in come on reflin's pool or break one break
stuff together let's go do the work go on reflin's go on well there was this company
that helped uh utano pandora to do her 3d concert and it's an upcoming company and i was like
oh my god insider knowledge too i met utano pandora before she debuted and before i debuted
no that's so cool yeah it's so i mean she doesn't know that all right she doesn't know that we met
before but i know that we met before oh my god that's so cool that's cool though she was so nice to me
i was um she's so lovely but i don't like interact with her anymore because she doesn't know who i am
smile um but she smile she's so so lovely grin yeah and her goal was to have a 3d concert
and she achieved it oh she achieved it that's so sweet we love girlies get her dreams achieved
achieve those goals uh you're only holding yourself back
just look at rayo bobble
bobble dee bobble dee bobble bobble i love seeing how like they move their models
i wonder what
not uger yet
on core come on get the fuck get back on that stage god damn we even finished it
oh an idol song we want an amazing song together
is that a is that a zora is that a zero can you hear is this thing
are you enjoying it
are you having fun is there uh
yeah
i didn't know really it's a reactive mimosa's ears are they are yeah they are they're all well
rigged um and her boobs too i know i can't stop sharing everyone's boobs
i don't understand in comparison they're actually i have like really bad eyes though so sometimes
mimosa's arms look like a part of her hair yeah she looks like a little nuggie i love it
her arms are very thin so they tend to kind of disappear into her hair for sure
her she's she's our little nugget my little nugget now i want chicken nuggets
oh my god i had really good chicken nuggets yesterday i know this is completely off topic
but it's fucking delicious i was like oh i always eat you i have bad eyes this is not an
excuse to stare at boobs let me alone oh get it get it get it get it this is so hate
yeah mimosa's voice
dinner her mouth tracking is really good
nothing wrong with wanting some strawberry milk get out of here
so
my question is are they doing a five-man song at the end i bet i hope they do yeah i'm getting
i wonder if they'll do like an original song yeah that would be crazy some people we should
do an original song yeah they're like why did veeler not do an original song oh i brought
it stressful and i was trying to debut last thing i want to do is give them a custom song that
like to try and do but if you guys want to like we should all have an original we should have an
a group song that's an original okay i'll do the male part of the song because my voice can have
that i'll do the rap part of the song i'll do the backup vocals that leaves azura and mercy
and icy perfect we're good yeah they can carry us through the through the actual vocals exactly
i'll just do the yeah oh adlibs oh he was adlib everything let's get it veeler
mommy right now taking notes honestly bro i'm spamming their dms i'm like how long did that
fucking take you're supposed to take a week we maybe even months honestly maybe this has been
cooking since day one you never know i know i want to ask the girls after
i want to eat the strawberries on her head i want to eat her
oh look at the little saucy wink she ended up she's like and she knows what she's doing
oh she knows it not to not to make you guys jealous but
please five man five man song come on
moving on
i know i just got scared i'm like what's happening
oh i feel that
oh my god i mean
really big
i'm ready oh it's a fireman oh let's fucking go let's go
oh that's amazing what song is this original question mark is this a k-pop song is it k-pop
yeah what song is this i'm wondering it makes sense that they picked like a k-pop group
because they all have like girl singers of different parts it's a twice song it is a twice song
i feel like i would recognize it if it was a
twice song but i guess i'm a fake twice fan name this particular members grandmother's
maiden name right now oh i'm getting tingles this is awesome
oh my god
can someone tell me what song this is it's kda apparently okay that makes more sense
oh it's kda yeah it's kda i mean why did somebody say it was twice why are you lying
oh it's i'll show you by kda and twice okay my cat oh okay what are you doing
what song for league of legends oh well that's azura fucking happy uh
she's probably geeking out right now hold on i want to go to her stream
i'm lying too she's gonna be saying all the words
well listen to azura singing too yeah she's probably harmonizing with them
oh she's not singing sing for me for me azura sing

i'm saying sing
i'm singing
wow my muscles voice

i like how azuras is like in the corner
that chair is eating heart
her voice
no on core give us more more i want more i want more

really dumb thing i did okay uh but let me make sure i i'm gonna redirect into this
after party we are all ears tell us i'll see if one of yous can guess it but
that was a very dumb move on my part what did you do now you're making me curious do you know
okay you don't tell what i did wrong oh if you can't tell then maybe i won't see anything oh hold on
a minute if you can't eat fail does it involve the script tired no oh okay i guess it's not obvious
