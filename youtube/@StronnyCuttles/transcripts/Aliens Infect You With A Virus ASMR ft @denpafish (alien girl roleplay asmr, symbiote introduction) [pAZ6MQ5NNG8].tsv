0	15240	I think our patient is waking up. Now you better be gentle with them. Last time you made
15240	26040	the specimens heart rate go to 160 beats per minute which is outrageous. All while they
26040	35800	were lying down made I add. Humans are resilient but not perfect. They have obvious limitations.
35800	44600	You should make better notes when working directly with them. It also lowers aggressiveness
44600	54680	overall. There was that other incident where you resorted to using your tentacles to restrain
54680	61720	them and you were left with a nasty mark for a while until you're newly married to heal it.
61720	68800	No they missed out often but there is a reason I ask you to be a part of this particular humans
68800	76920	induction. In the case report here it says they didn't even resist. Looks like they are a deep
76920	87360	sleeper. Or some kind of insomnia. Or if they do find you get to sleep. It's so deep. They have no clue
87360	95080	what's going on around them. How fascinating. They can't just turn it on like a switch or a timer.
95080	102760	What intricate little things they make for their daily lives. It can't seem to fix themselves.
103400	112520	A shame. Well hopefully they will soon learn our ways are superior. Oh they're awake now.
113800	121720	Hello dear specimen. Please do not pull on the first strange. That is fuel that will just
121720	131080	allow you to your heart rate. Relax. You are safe and in a serialized lab for lack of better words.
132040	138840	We are just running some boring guinea pig test on you and then from there you will be infected
138840	147800	with our virus and back to mingle with your own. Oh don't worry we are testing how rapidly humans
147800	155400	can be infected so if it doesn't go too well it's not like you failed. If anything the results are
155480	165160	very valuable or well they are to us anyway. With a little bit more bedside manners that
165160	171960	wasn't bad I think you will be fined to conduct some of these experiments on your own.
173400	180440	First human we do have to take some samples so that we have a baseline from when you started
180440	189160	and where you are in a month's time. Oh yeah we do have to recapture you but don't worry
189160	197640	you already have a tracker in you. We will be watching over you the whole time almost like an
197640	207240	angel. You humans do love the idea of something watching over you even if they are powerless but
207320	220520	this time well something very strong and powerful is caring for you. Who comforted and
220600	226440	trained you think? Let me just check over you real quickly.
233480	237800	It looks pretty alright to me.
237800	255080	Let me just prepare them for you.
255080	272360	Okay it's time to infect them. This one turned one bit I promise.
272920	281560	Our technology is unsprisingly a lot more advanced than you think. However the side effects are
281560	291960	rather curious. Most humans explain it like a weird lucid dream but it's rather favorable
291960	298280	due to the fact not a single soul will believe you when you explain this experience in detail.
298280	307000	How amazing.
