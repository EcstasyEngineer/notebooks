420000	424280	I feel so so inspired.
424280	428720	I mean, my people used to do that, that's so cool.
428720	431680	I mean, I've never fed on a human before,
431680	434840	and the smartest thing I've ever hypnotized is a seal.
434840	440560	But learning that my ancestors used to eat humans by the literal boatloads was amazing.
440560	442960	I couldn't wait to grow up and eat my fill.
442960	447200	Fat ones, tall ones, skinny ones, even hairy ones.
447200	452800	Though I learned our people aren't as feared by humans as they once were.
452800	461680	My ocean, my home, humans defile it with their presence, worse still, they toss their filth into it,
461680	468160	further insulting us. How could this have happened? How were we brought so low from our past?
468160	473760	They used to tell legends on every port that made even the most straight-laced superstition scoffing
473760	479200	marines keep on the back of their minds. They would dedicate figureheads of their ships in respect
479200	487600	to our beautiful yet delicate bodies. They put us on every map, but now? Ugh, disgusting humans.
488800	494880	One night, I envisioned a genius plan, the first strike in my crusade against the human world.
497120	502400	I would infiltrate in hijack a fishing vessel and use it as my own pirate vessel with a crew of
502400	508240	hypnotised thralls. I was going to wage a once siren war against all of humanity.
508240	515360	It was going to be perfect, and I definitely would have won. That was until I envisioned a plan
515360	522640	that was even more perfect. Er, well, at least more time efficient. Making my way below deck,
522640	531360	I made a strange discovery. The humans were hypnotised by their own choice. I couldn't believe it.
531360	538800	I looked at boat after boat. These humans charmed like a siren's spell, even dedicated their
538800	547600	lives to their chosen idols. These idols they fawn over were these sirens too. That's it. That's
547600	552720	the secret to defeating the humans. I'm going to find the secret to their magic and harness this
552720	559680	power myself and bring power back to my people. I must gather fame, fortune, scandals, anything
559680	565120	and everything to grow my influence over mankind to bring sirens back into the minds of the people.
566320	571360	But I'm not just going to tip the scales. I'm going for complete domination.
573200	579120	Every human will bend to my will. All will be cheering for their own demise. I will be the
579120	585120	instrument of karmic justice. The world will worship me and praise my name as I bring about their
585120	591680	end. I will march every human under my control into the ocean and my people will chant my name as they
591680	602320	have a feeding frenzy that has written into legend. Though that's a very long term goal.
603520	611200	With every big venture, whether business wise or lifestyle, every big undertaking starts small scale.
611280	621280	Right? Hmm. So, I think I'll start with you.
634400	639280	You wanted a feral kusugaki? I gave you a feral kusugaki.
641200	644320	You wanted a doten hag? I gave you a doten hag.
647680	651200	You wanted a dorky yandere? I gave you a dorky yandere.
654880	658960	You wanted a masochistic brocon? I gave you a masochistic brocon.
661680	665680	You wanted a milk dominatrix? I gave you a milk dominatrix.
665680	678160	And now, I bring you the vichu bird that no one asked for. A god damn nutty cuttlefish.
696160	706160	No copyright. No copyright. No copyright intended, bros. Come on, come on, come on. Relax, relax.
707760	719360	Did I kick or did I fucking kick, ladies and gentlemen? Have you enjoyed your evening so far?
719360	723360	Have you been warmed up by my girls?
723360	733360	Who stole your heart the most? Was it A.C., the feral polar bear, or was it Azura, the literal definition of mommy milkers?
733360	743360	Or what about Mercy, the yandere that can never love right? I mean, she got plenty of love to give, doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna be alive at the end of it, okay?
743360	751360	But hey ho, you know, you still get love done at the end of the day. Or was it Emmy, the most controversially created character of all time?
751360	759360	But hey ho, look, we're just gonna skip past that. You know, if you ignore the lore, everything else is fine. It's fine. It's fine. Stop worrying.
759360	765360	You guys are such a blurry war, honestly. Or was it Madame Shuby herself?
765360	775360	Because, you know, gonna be honest, didn't really get many requests for a hypnotic cuttlefish, that's Scottish, but hey ho, hey ho, that's how it goes, that's how it goes.
775360	785360	There's something made me, let me formally introduce myself. Look at these sleighs, they're so pretty, they're so pretty.
786360	795360	I, ladies and gentlemen, am Strony Cuttles. Please, Cuttles, the surname is because I'm a Cuttlefish.
795360	804360	Oh, shock of any. And Strony, because I am Strony, the daughter of the gamer Strontyum.
804360	810360	My dad's gamer tag is Strontyum. No, it's not actually Strontyum, before you're like, oh my god, you just dox your dad.
810360	817360	No, relax, it's not actually literally really, you know, Stronyum, but I'm Strony, Cuttles, I'm named after my dad.
817360	821360	My dad's gamer, and I wouldn't be here without him, you know, because he came from his ballsack.
821360	829360	Anyway, age, age, ladies and gentlemen, oh, yet again, I have failed the VTuber challenge of tell us your age.
829360	833360	It's not really looking good, okay, it's not looking good.
834360	841360	Cuttlefish normally live to a year, so time's ticking, time is ticking.
841360	848360	Anyway, my birthday is October 10th, which is actually National Squid and Cuttlefish Day.
848360	854360	They're both cephalopods, so I don't mind sharing that birthday with the Squid VTubers if there's any of these out there.
854360	865360	My height is 162cm, which makes me 5'3", because I forgot to update the slide like Adapte, but hey, hold, we're here now.
865360	880360	For my languages, turns out, if you're born in Scotland, the British government recognises Scottish slang as its own language, so in your face, I can speak two languages, so...
880360	882360	It's fantastic with that.
911360	912360	Show us your plaster.
912360	913360	No!
913360	914360	Oh God, can you see it?
914360	916360	Wait, you're not supposed to see that part, yeah!
917360	920360	Like, I had to censor myself, my design's a little saucy.
921360	922360	Anyway, what was I saying?
922360	928360	A-Smart, if you like A-Smart, me and my gen mates are all literally A-Smart out of the wazoo.
928360	932360	So don't be shy to like or subscribe on any of them.
934360	936360	I'll give you a bigger hint than that, but hey, hold.
936360	942360	I like seeing victory on my screen, because I could use any tiddly wink of serotonin possible.
942360	947360	And, you know, you get it from playing multiplayer games, and you're in the same boat as me.
947360	949360	And I also like plasters and band-aids.
954360	956360	For no nefarious reason, of course.
956360	962360	For my dislikes, grrr, you know, hate is a strong word for my dislikes instead, grrr.
962360	964360	I don't like bullies in video games.
964360	968360	Your teammates aren't often a magically beat MLG pro, so relax.
968360	971360	You don't have fun, it's a multiplayer game, it's a game.
971360	972360	Just enjoy yourself, okay?
973360	974360	I don't like serious people.
974360	975360	I don't like seriousness.
976360	984360	I think my gen mates can all pray for each boutch that I am the most un-serious and ridiculous.
987360	988360	I can't be serious.
988360	989360	It's terrible.
989360	992360	I'm the most unprofessional person they've probably ever worked with in their entire life.
995360	998360	And I don't like Mongolian throat singing.
998360	999360	I'm so sorry.
1000360	1004360	People seem to really like it, but I don't.
1005360	1006360	It doesn't sound nice.
1007360	1011360	So, I apologize to the one Mongolian throat singer that's watching right now.
1014360	1015360	I just can't.
1015360	1017360	Okay, I'm nice and generic.
1017360	1019360	Sorry, there's nothing interesting about my taste.
1020360	1023360	Movies, Lord of the Rings, best as we come.
1023360	1026360	Animes, nice and generic again.
1026360	1027360	Books.
1027360	1028360	I actually started reading books this year.
1028360	1032360	I know it sounds crazy at the end because people read books in general.
1032360	1033360	Me?
1033360	1035360	However, I started this year.
1035360	1041360	I really like dystopian books that talk about human nature and how humans are stinky poo poo heads.
1041360	1043360	For some reason, they just really capture me.
1043360	1045360	I like being depressed after reading a book.
1046360	1050360	For my music, Hatsune Miku and Atarashi Gako,
1050360	1052360	I want to see them live if it's possible.
1053360	1055360	Yeah, sorry, it's like choking my spit.
1058360	1059360	Oh, yeah.
1059360	1061360	Just a wee bit of a gamer.
1061360	1062360	A tiny bit of a gamer.
1063360	1064360	It doesn't mean I'm good at games.
1064360	1066360	Now, before there's that one person that's like,
1066360	1068360	eh, you've played all these games.
1068360	1069360	That means you're an MLG pro.
1069360	1071360	No, relax, relax.
1071360	1074360	I've played games full stop, okay?
1074360	1076360	These are the games that I remember playing
1076360	1078360	or just kind of like have a good,
1078360	1080360	yeah, play them type thing, okay?
1080360	1083360	So, you might have a few things in common.
1083360	1085360	I could, you know, move out of the way.
1085360	1088360	There's some Lego games, I still love my Lego games.
1088360	1091360	But yeah, these are all the games that I remember playing.
1091360	1093360	There's tons that I've obviously missed out on
1093360	1095360	that are like so tiny that it's kind of hard to mention.
1095360	1097360	But there's a big old square red for you
1097360	1100360	as we see it was about an Xbox gamer to apologize.
1100360	1102360	The old Call of Duty days.
1103360	1104360	Yeah.
1105360	1107360	For my goals,
1107360	1109360	I want to get monetized on YouTube.
1111360	1113360	So, feel free to subscribe
1113360	1115360	because we have been called like crazy
1115360	1117360	since announcing ourselves.
1118360	1119360	And we need watch hours.
1119360	1122360	So, don't be shy to rewatch anything
1122360	1124360	that is offered on the channel to you.
1124360	1126360	I want to stream so much
1126360	1130360	that you can basically read everything in my voice.
1130360	1132360	And, you know, you'll be Scots yourself
1132360	1134360	and you can apply for citizenship
1134360	1136360	and all that good stuff.
1137360	1140360	I also want to create a mega Ace more collab
1140360	1141360	with my gen mates,
1141360	1144360	which I've already got quite a few on the way.
1144360	1146360	So, don't worry, it's coming.
1146360	1148360	You just got to wait, okay?
1148360	1151360	I have a childhood dream, actually,
1151360	1153360	of a 100,000 gamer score.
1153360	1156360	And it's actually possible now with Xbox Game Pass.
1156360	1158360	I would absolutely love to explore
1158360	1160360	a heken amount of
1162360	1163360	childhood games.
1163360	1164360	And I would love to play
1164360	1166360	like your childhood games as well,
1166360	1168360	because obviously I was kind of at the mercy
1168360	1171360	of what my dad would buy me for childhood games,
1171360	1173360	so it doesn't quite count.
1174360	1177360	So, here's a little fun factoid about me.
1177360	1180360	I'm a wee bit of a workaholic.
1180360	1183360	So, I would like to say that for every 1000 subscribers
1183360	1185360	I get on my YouTube channel,
1185360	1187360	I'm going to upload a celebratory
1187360	1189360	really hard to say that if you're Scottish,
1189360	1190360	celebrate it already.
1191360	1194360	Ace more video, pair 1000 subscribers.
1194360	1196360	I've already got like tons
1196360	1199360	ready to go, so don't be shy.
1199360	1202360	You know what to do, wink, wink.
1203360	1206360	I also want to challenge myself.
1206360	1207360	I want to collab.
1207360	1209360	I want to make Ace more collab
1209360	1212360	with over 100 different beatubers.
1212360	1214360	And I'm actually so much of a workaholic.
1214360	1216360	I already have three confirmed
1216360	1218360	with beatubers outside of VLR, so...
1220360	1222360	I'm very serious about that.
1222360	1224360	If you ever have a 3DO, you're a beatuber,
1225360	1227360	I'm coming to find you in your DMs.
1228360	1231360	I would love if we could read Lord of the Rings together.
1231360	1233360	I think it would be so fun.
1233360	1235360	I'm not a very strong reader,
1235360	1237360	but I think it would be really cute to do like a little
1239360	1240360	before the end of stream.
1240360	1243360	We read one chapter or something like that.
1243360	1246360	And last, but certainly not least,
1246360	1248360	I would love to get stream sniped.
1248360	1250360	I absolutely adore it.
1250360	1252360	I love playing multiplayer games
1252360	1253360	where you can join me,
1253360	1254360	and you can have an amazing time,
1254360	1255360	and have so much fun.
1255360	1257360	It's just one of my favourite things, okay?
1257360	1259360	So please do not be shy.
1259360	1261360	Every week I plan on playing multiplayer games
1261360	1263360	where you can join me at any point.
1263360	1265360	I will try to make them free and accessible
1265360	1266360	as I can, but yes, yes, yes.
1266360	1268360	These are my goals. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
1269360	1270360	I'm dumb.
1270360	1271360	Okay, I'm really dumb.
1271360	1273360	I don't know how to come up with tags.
1273360	1275360	I'm not funny. I'm not good with puns.
1275360	1279360	So I am more than happy to take any suggestion.
1279360	1282360	We can figure it out very soon.
1282360	1284360	Don't worry, okay?
1284360	1286360	My Oshi marks are squid,
1286360	1288360	but I'm a cuttlefish,
1288360	1291360	but squids and cuttlefish are cephalopods,
1291360	1293360	so I don't mind sharing the emoji.
1293360	1295360	And then the second emoji
1295360	1297360	kind of looks like a man bowing.
1297360	1299360	Hmm? Hmm?
1299360	1301360	Maybe that is a hint to what I might
1301360	1303360	try to make content-wise.
1305360	1307360	And for fan names,
1307360	1309360	there is only going to be one option.
1309360	1312360	Come on, let's not beat around the bush.
1312360	1315360	You are my refling.
1315360	1317360	You will always be my refling.
1317360	1319360	And thank you so fucking much for waiting.
1319360	1321360	I have bloody missed you.
1324360	1326360	Special shout out to
1326360	1328360	Nari
1328360	1330360	and Squishy Girl.
1330360	1332360	You may have noticed a bit of a
1332360	1334360	trending pattern, right?
1334360	1336360	A bit of a trending pattern.
1336360	1338360	Squishy Girl,
1338360	1340360	conceptualized us all
1340360	1342360	and now I helped out
1342360	1344360	and made us come to life, which is beautiful, beautiful.

1360360	1362360	So thank you everyone who came together
1362360	1364360	to make this fantastic gen
1364360	1366360	of indulge.
1366360	1368360	Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.
1368360	1370360	No, no.
1370360	1372360	Most people get to do
1372360	1375360	Oh, this is my gen mate's impression.
1375360	1377360	Okay? Gen mate's impression.
1377360	1380360	Me, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1380360	1382360	I picked
1382360	1384360	my gen mate's. Do you understand?
1384360	1386360	I picked them, okay?
1386360	1388360	They're all going to tell you why I picked them.
1388360	1390360	You ready for this?
1390360	1393360	Mercy's determination.
1393360	1395360	She was going to make it no matter what.
1395360	1398360	A little determining, like,
1398360	1401360	the definition of mercy in the dictionary
1401360	1403360	if you look it up, it just says determined, okay?
1403360	1406360	There was no way and heck she was not going to get in.
1406360	1408360	That's all I'm going to say on that one.
1408360	1410360	And then Emmy
1411360	1414360	I'm going to have to be
1414360	1416360	Emmy
1416360	1418360	say to someone
1418360	1420360	who's being rid to her
1420360	1422360	to keep themselves safe in Minecraft
1422360	1424360	and then she instantly got the part, okay?
1426360	1428360	I say, I say, oh, I say
1428360	1430360	has fantastic
1430360	1432360	experience
1432360	1434360	in history and she's such a hard worker.
1434360	1436360	She gives her best, okay?
1436360	1438360	She gives everything 100%
1438360	1440360	and it was absolutely beautiful.
1440360	1442360	And she actually, she had the most
1442360	1444360	professional application
1446360	1448360	even though English isn't her first language
1448360	1450360	and I'm like, god damn, A.C.,
1450360	1452360	you're fucking impressive.
1454360	1456360	Then Azura,
1456360	1458360	okay, I describe Azura
1458360	1460360	as my little diamond in the rough.
1460360	1462360	Now hear me out before you're like,
1462360	1464360	isn't that an insult? Relax.
1464360	1466360	I'm not told the full story yet, my goodness, you're jumping the gun.
1466360	1468360	I
1468360	1470360	was going to
1470360	1472360	cross off Azura's
1472360	1474360	stream as I was reviewing her
1474360	1476360	because she wasn't talking, she wasn't interacting
1476360	1478360	and she wasn't really doing anything
1478360	1480360	and then she said three words
1480360	1482360	in that voice.
1484360	1486360	Azura!
1486360	1488360	She instantly became Azura.
1488360	1490360	She said three words and she got the damn part
1490360	1492360	and she was like, in that voice, in that part.
1492360	1494360	I can't mimic her voice, okay?
1494360	1496360	But
1496360	1498360	I need gold.
1498360	1500360	Rosyksu!
1500360	1502360	Rosyksu.
1502360	1504360	And Sheevee. Sheevee is everything
1504360	1506360	I should have been in another life, okay?
1506360	1508360	She is going very far.
1508360	1510360	I'm very happy, absolutely.
1510360	1512360	I could not have asked for
1512360	1514360	better gen mates. I am blown away
1514360	1516360	that these girls even have
1516360	1518360	fucking applied to such a crazy idea.
1518360	1520360	And here we are,
1520360	1522360	debut and you guys have shown
1522360	1524360	nothing but love and support
1524360	1526360	and we are all so thankful.
1526360	1528360	I'm sure I speak for all of us when we were like
1528360	1530360	holy fuck, thank you.
1530360	1532360	Because we didn't expect any of this.
1532360	1534360	We're just like, yeah, we're just going to be my bird.
1536360	1538360	Ray, let me take you to
1538360	1540360	Zabbe.
1540360	1542360	Oh, I forgot
1542360	1544360	to pull you. It's for decoration, okay?
1544360	1546360	The tentacle in the back is for decoration.
1548360	1550360	I won't, no questions.
1550360	1552360	Let me do the full body.
1552360	1554360	Let's start with the full body.
1554360	1556360	May have a bandaid on for
1558360	1560360	reasons.
1560360	1562360	But as you can see, I got some
1562360	1564360	swivelly hips, thank you.
1566360	1568360	We'll start from the bottom.
1568360	1570360	You know how it is, okay?
1570360	1572360	So if you didn't know, I actually
1572360	1574360	have what's known as a French manicure
1574360	1576360	and pedicure.
1576360	1578360	So you can see my little
1578360	1580360	toenails.
1580360	1582360	This is French manicure pedicure.
1582360	1584360	And then you go up my face.
1584360	1586360	And
1586360	1588360	don't even be careful at my thighs because of the bandaid.
1590360	1592360	Is this smart? Is this white?
1592360	1594360	Okay, okay, I don't think that's white. Okay, check it out.
1594360	1596360	See look, I've got
1596360	1598360	oh, my voice is cracking.
1598360	1600360	I've got a French pedicure
1600360	1602360	manicure. See?
1602360	1604360	We're just going to skip past the bottom part, okay?
1604360	1606360	And as you can see
1606360	1608360	if you look really close to the elbows
1608360	1610360	I have pearlescent
1610360	1612360	to my outfit. My outfit isn't white
1612360	1614360	it's pearlescent.
1614360	1616360	So I shimmer as I move about.
1616360	1618360	It's fantastic. And so there's my
1618360	1620360	seashells at the top too.
1620360	1622360	If you look at real close
1622360	1624360	you have to really look for it.
1624360	1626360	But look, I'm a shiny little seashell.
1626360	1628360	What do you think?
1628360	1630360	It's good, no?
1630360	1632360	Yeah, I'm in the Yukata
1632360	1634360	because
1634360	1636360	it's a homage to Japanese culture
1636360	1638360	because without Japanese culture, let's be honest
1638360	1640360	maybe trippers would be here
1640360	1642360	so
1642360	1644360	you know, go a little bit catagona.
1644360	1646360	Okay, let me
1646360	1648360	let me get real close. Hopefully this isn't uncomfortable.
1648360	1650360	I know some people aren't like
1650360	1652360	the best with eye contact
1652360	1654360	but look, don't, it's me. It's me, okay?
1654360	1656360	I'm a brain.
1656360	1658360	Oh, the star.
1658360	1660360	I
1660360	1662360	I like
1662360	1664360	if I open my eyes
1664360	1666360	it opens
1666360	1668360	I love you so much.
1668360	1670360	Oh and I'm sad
1670360	1672360	I'm sad please.
1672360	1674360	Better not upset me, go subscribe
1674360	1676360	to my gem me. You upset
1676360	1678360	me.
1678360	1680360	I have pupil restrict like
1680360	1682360	what did you say?
1684360	1686360	I'm unamused.
1686360	1688360	You failed me.
1688360	1690360	I don't know, I can't do it.
1690360	1692360	I can't do it the way she does it.
1692360	1694360	She's just off the top of her head and I'm like
1694360	1696360	These are my heart eyes. I love them.
1696360	1698360	And like, okay
1698360	1700360	this is just my opinion but do you see how
1700360	1702360	my neck is doing that thing where
1702360	1704360	in the chin area and it disappears?
1704360	1706360	Oh, I love it so much
1706360	1708360	in beach of remodels when they do it.
1708360	1710360	Oh, I love it.
1710360	1712360	I love it.
1712360	1714360	You're good.
1714360	1716360	You're trying to make me blush,
1716360	1718360	would you?
1718360	1720360	Have you ever seen a blushing coffee before?
1722360	1724360	Oh, actually this is a very good point.
1724360	1726360	Some people don't like
1726360	1728360	backseat gaming.
1728360	1730360	I'm the opposite.
1730360	1732360	I'm very dumb.
1732360	1734360	I'm very happy for you a backseat game.
1734360	1736360	So you're probably going to see this one a lot
1736360	1738360	if you care to watch me at any point.
1740360	1742360	I got
1742360	1744360	I don't know
1744360	1746360	I swear
1746360	1748360	I'm looking at my jammies all day.
1748360	1750360	Like, come on, the designs are good.
1750360	1752360	Don't lie.
1752360	1754360	Oh, oh
1754360	1756360	I might have spoiled it there
1756360	1758360	but you know how
1758360	1760360	cuttlefish have hypnotic patterns?
1760360	1762360	May I please
1762360	1764360	do this for you? Are you ready?

1770360	1772360	We're going to be using this for a lot of ASMR.
1778360	1780360	You wouldn't fall for my hypnotic
1780360	1782360	capabilities.
1784360	1786360	But if you're really struggling
1786360	1788360	like if you're really struggling

1806360	1808360	I mean, how can you resist?
1808360	1810360	How can you resist this little Scottish accent?
1810360	1812360	Right
1812360	1814360	Right, right attend
1814360	1816360	Schedule time
1816360	1818360	So

1820360	1822360	debut 2.0
1822360	1824360	which is fantastic
1824360	1826360	Me on the other hand
1826360	1828360	I'm exposing the damn company
1828360	1830360	I've had enough of VLR
1830360	1832360	I'm exposing every little
1832360	1834360	dirty secret they have
1834360	1836360	So if you're excited
1836360	1838360	to know the ins and outs of what it's like
1838360	1840360	to run a VTuber agency
1840360	1842360	to create one, to fund one
1842360	1844360	to know what goes on behind the scenes
1844360	1846360	that's right
1846360	1848360	and you can show up to my stream the more
1848360	1850360	So
1850360	1852360	Obviously
1852360	1854360	I'm playing the greatest game of all time
1854360	1856360	in my first week
1856360	1858360	Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
1858360	1860360	I will not be taking any statements
1860360	1862360	any questions
1862360	1864360	and any threats about claiming
1864360	1866360	that Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is not the
1866360	1868360	greatest game of all time
1868360	1870360	So sorry, not sorry, but yeah
1870360	1872360	We also have needy streamer overload
1872360	1874360	James Cameron's Avatar
1874360	1876360	which is such a niche game
1876360	1878360	2 people who are watching this right now
1878360	1880360	probably played it
1880360	1882360	The multiplayer game of the week is old school runescape
1882360	1884360	if you'd like to do some co-esting with me
1884360	1886360	I'm also doing an ASMR stream
1886360	1888360	and
1888360	1890360	a hand cam stream
1890360	1892360	where I'm trying foreign sweets
1892360	1894360	or can die
1894360	1896360	if you're American
1896360	1898360	or if you're Australian
1898360	1900360	you say lollipops
1900360	1902360	So yeah, we did a little
1902360	1904360	cheeky hand cam stream
1904360	1906360	I think there's
1906360	1908360	a few hand cam streams coming up from
1908360	1910360	my gen mates already
1910360	1912360	Someone was surprised I was doing hand cam
1912360	1914360	and I'm like
1914360	1916360	I mean
1916360	1918360	we're not like
1918360	1920360	I don't know what part kind of tips you off that
1920360	1922360	we're not like other agencies unironically
1922360	1924360	like was it the 80-20 split
1924360	1926360	maybe did that tip you off
1926360	1928360	or like the 100% marriage sales got the talent
1928360	1930360	was it that part that tips you off that
1930360	1932360	we're not quite like any other agency
1932360	1934360	but yeah
1934360	1936360	let's go to
1936360	1938360	Chewatt
1938360	1940360	that's a lot of movement
1940360	1942360	but yes, that is my first week
1942360	1944360	I'm pretty much an endurance streamer
1944360	1946360	so good luck keeping up with me
1946360	1948360	okay
1948360	1950360	Emmy Dookie
1950360	1952360	Emmy
1952360	1954360	right
