0	6000	Dancing if she says there's no audio in-game.
9000	12000	What goes up must come down.
30000	40000	Let me do a live chat.
40000	42000	Hold on, let me do a live chat.
42000	43000	Wait, there we go.
43000	45000	It felt tough, but it wouldn't work.
45000	47000	Good morning!
47000	48000	Good morning.
48000	50000	Good evening, good afternoon.
51000	53000	I'm Strony Cuttles.
53000	55000	I'm supposed to be the hypnotist.
55000	59000	And I've produced nothing hypnotist-wise, except that one live stream.
61000	63000	I've only slept two fucking hours.
70000	71000	What a good song.
71000	73000	That's a good song and that's a good show.
74000	75000	That's not gonna stop me, okay?
75000	77000	That's not gonna stop me.
79000	83000	I'd like to apologise to any bleeding hearts who may be lurking.
85000	87000	Oh my, what's this sayfile?
87000	90000	Hmm, looks oddly familiar.
90000	93000	If I click start, is it gonna remember that I did...
93000	95000	Did I do Sonic?
100000	101000	Does it remember?
101000	103000	Oh wow, it did.
105000	110000	I only slept two hours, cracks the can of cola for the fucking any ounce of the thingy.
112000	113000	I can't believe this, remember?
113000	114000	Holy crap.
114000	117000	So we've actually done Team Rose and Team Sonic.
117000	119000	Never done Team Chaotic.
119000	124000	I've never done Dark, but we may actually have 100% sayfile, which I didn't expect.
124000	126000	So we are playing Team Chaotic.
130000	132000	Now I know it's really weird setup.
132000	136000	There's like a big black gap in between me, but it's fine.
137000	140000	We're just painting, don't you mind, painting.
143000	145000	But we're jumping straight into...
145000	146000	It's here, it's here.
146000	148000	We've got work.
149000	151000	It's here, it's here.
151000	153000	I've heard good things about you.
153000	156000	I would like to order your detective services.
156000	158000	Yeah, detective services.
160000	161000	34 aspect ratio.
161000	164000	I actually have a layout that's 34.
165000	166000	Don't be silly.
167000	170000	We never turned down work that pays.
170000	176000	So I've never actually completed these guys past the power point, power station map.
178000	180000	Could you just show the whole abstract?
180000	181000	You want me to be full body?
182000	184000	I missed the first minute of stront is over.
184000	186000	Oh no, I started early.
187000	188000	See.
191000	193000	So this is Team Chaotic.
193000	196000	I'll talk a little bit in the background.
196000	199000	Hold on, how about I do my yapping?
199000	203000	I actually went back in the binding of Isaacs dream because it was so good.
203000	206000	I team stamped it myself so people can enjoy me.
206000	207000	Freaking playing the loss.
207000	211000	I can't believe I did that and I don't know for any of you who didn't watch the binding of Isaacs.
211000	213000	I don't know why I'm frog blinking.
213000	215800	I promise I'm not frog blinking in real life, okay?
216680	224680	Frickin, I pulled the holy mantle card at the last possible second before delirium got me, okay?
225640	228600	Before delirium zapped my butt cheeks.
229160	235240	Um, you can literally hear me pull the card and then the crack on delirium.
235240	239240	I didn't, I didn't realize I did it because it went so, it went by so quick.
240200	241960	Three whole timestamps there.
243160	248120	Um, but yeah, I, oh my god, fantastic.
248120	251080	I cannot believe that Binding of Isaac Run happened.
251800	257880	I don't know what streamer luck I'm getting and Beltrow and Isaac and all of it.
257880	261400	Such a gamer honestly, an accidental gamer.
261400	263880	Me like, should I break up Brimstone?
263880	266840	Just waiting for you guys to tell me what to do.
266840	269320	I was barely able to sleep after the excitement.
269320	273160	I genuinely couldn't even process, like I looked back on it and I'm like,
273160	278200	Stranny, Stranny for fuck's sake, you just, you just did delirium by accident.
279720	283080	Like when I was lucky enough to even get access to the delirium portal.
283080	287480	Um, I have my first Patreon audio upload this month.
287480	290840	The next one is going to be coming out in two or three days.
290840	295640	Bleeding Hearts, Azura's first one is going to come out after asleep.
295640	297160	I'm so sorry for the delay.
297160	300920	There's a lot of shit happening behind the scenes, but there's a fantastic, um,
302120	305400	news that's going to be broken soon-ish.
307080	310600	I can't break it yet, but once it gets broken,
310600	313880	you'll understand like, oh, some stuff had to happen in the background.
313880	317880	Oh, and, um, so yes, I am very excited about that.
317880	319480	Sorry for the delay.
319480	323640	Get it, delay, because it's French and you say, doodly.
323640	324120	Yeah, that's right.
324120	325720	I named them after French stuff.
325720	327960	No, I'm not naming any other gen after them.
327960	332040	So I'm sorry, but Fond de la Buzum will never be recreated and you'll never get it back.
332840	335160	Um, huge news puns.
335160	337640	But then again, yes, the stream went all according to the script.
337640	338360	Well done, everybody.
338360	339320	Stop it!
339320	342600	People are going to think this is pre-recorded reflames.
343400	350600	Um, I have a, I accidentally slipped into another ASMR collab with someone.
350600	351800	I'm terrible.
351800	353240	I've, I was going to announce,
353240	357800	I've finally caught up with all scripts with all my ASMR collab, collab partners.
357800	360920	And I, I fricking slipped and stumbled into another one.
360920	362600	I don't know how I keep happening.
362600	367960	Um, but, uh, I've got, I actually have collabs in August.
367960	371080	I think with people outside of violour.
371080	374120	Oh no, I have to be, I have to be social.
374120	379720	I have to, I have to understand what people want and be nice and stuff.
380600	380920	Yeah.
380920	381880	Oh, we started early.
381880	382760	Yes, I apologize.
383000	384760	For any snowberries that might be lost,
384760	387080	I just realized there was no background in game audio.
387080	391000	Um, YouTube, please stop prompting me to insert ads.
391000	391880	I'd appreciate it.
391880	393480	Speaking of YouTube and ads,
393480	395960	uh, all my streams are getting limited all of a sudden.
395960	398840	And I'm like, I don't think I'm saying anything that outrageous.
398840	401400	And I might be overly swearing because I do swear a lot.
401400	403320	Mm, I do mean, um,
404600	407000	mommy's normal now, honestly.
407000	407720	Be gentle with yourselves.
407720	409080	You've been top tier streaming for a while,
409080	411640	luncheon and top tier company, company.
411640	412920	I'm personally helpful in lots.
412920	414680	You deserve all the praise and slack.
414680	415960	Oh, give me that slack.
417240	419160	Give me your slack refund.
419160	419880	Oh, also me.
419880	421560	I wonder why I keep getting limited ads.
421560	421880	Hmm.
421880	422280	Curious.
422280	424360	Uh, curious, curious.
424360	425880	Is there some sort of correlation?
425880	426360	Hmm.
426360	427080	Who knows?
427640	428200	The Ys.
428200	428680	Good morning.
428680	429160	Good evening.
429160	430040	Good afternoon.
430040	431400	I'm Stewanyi.
431400	434360	My voice is broken because I've overused it too much.
434360	435960	My dad actually made a comment.
435960	438440	He was like, your voice does not sound like your voice.
438440	441800	But on stream, it sounds actually relatively fine.
441800	444200	The microphone is covering how damaged my voice is.
445000	449160	Um, I, yes, a Patreon audio came out.
450120	450920	It's helped me.
451480	454440	I mentioned this a little bit the other day
454440	459320	on how good my accent is for ignore popcorn.
460200	466360	Um, I have, I have a very good voice for ignore slash free use.
467080	469720	And I've only just realized it.
469720	472280	And I'm like, maybe I should dip into it a bit more.
472280	474360	Because like, I have a really, uh, just do what you want.
474360	476040	Let me just keep playing Sonic Heroes.
476040	476440	Come on.
477400	479400	I literally, it's terrible.
479400	482040	But I'm like, oh no, I have a really good voice for it.
482040	483800	Like, that's the thing I would have had to pick.
483800	486280	Because I've been struggling with my accent.
486280	489320	I feel quite, I feel quite self-conscious with my accent
489320	491000	when I'm recording that kind of stuff.
491000	492200	Because it sounds rather odd.
492200	494120	I'm like, oh, a refline, were you then?
494120	495560	Oh, do you like how that feels?
495640	497800	Like, I'm struggling a wee bit.
497800	500040	But, you know, nothing we can't overcome together.
501480	504360	So I'm not going to try and get into my head too much.
504360	505560	Because at the end of the day,
505560	507320	we're making Shakespeare out here.
507320	509160	We're making things to Shakespeare out here.
510280	511240	Me and the boys.
511800	513560	Um, quite unique, yes.
514680	519240	Um, so I actually thought my dad was here longer.
520120	523160	Um, than our original, I thought it was three weeks.
523160	525320	Unless the days have gone by so quick.
525320	527880	But he's actually getting shipped out in two weeks.
528680	531320	Technical is dead if Johnny doesn't join the audio though.
531320	532520	Your voice and accent are very cute.
532520	533720	I love it. Oh, thank you very much.
533720	534520	That's very kind.
535480	537080	The music is a bit loud, by the way.
538040	538760	What music?
539400	540840	You shouldn't hear anything right now.
540840	541800	Everything should be muted.
541800	543640	It should be my voice and nothing more.
544600	548200	Do you mean Sonic Heroes at the start when I was singing?
548200	550040	I meant, I'm inclined to believe you.
550040	550440	I am.
550440	551000	It's true.
551560	553400	I hear no music shipped out, bro.
553400	554360	Yeah, he's getting shipped.
555000	557960	As a Scot, I'm happy to have more Scot audios.
557960	558920	That one bit him.
558920	560840	That one was bit him, Swerdy.
564040	564520	Thank you.
564520	564920	Thank you.
565560	566600	Wait, why is that?
566600	568360	That is echoing.
568360	568760	Hold on.
568760	569560	What was the joke?
570600	571640	Take what joke I said.
571640	572360	Hold on.
572360	573640	What was the joke?
573640	574120	Go back.
575800	576840	It was schizophrenia.
576840	577880	I had another tab open.
577880	579080	It started playing music.
580840	581560	Oh dear.
581560	583000	The refunds are losing it.
583000	584200	Wait, what was the joke?
584200	585640	I forgot what I said.
585640	586520	The Shakespeare one.
588840	590680	You know, we're not out here to make Shakespeare.
590680	592760	We're just making stuff to shake your spirit.
595480	596600	Oh, and it didn't play.
596600	596840	Okay.
597480	598280	It didn't play.
598280	599000	Wait, why no?
599000	599960	Why did you get?
599960	601240	I got stage fright.
601240	601960	Oh, there we go.
601960	602360	Okay.
602360	603320	It's fine.
603320	604520	I got stage fright.
604520	605960	Are you okay, little guy?
605960	607080	Little stream deck.
607080	607880	Are you all right there?
608920	610600	He got shy.
611160	613000	Oh, poor guy.
613000	613400	Oh, great.
613400	614680	I'm like, come on.
614680	615320	Where's my cue?
615960	616280	Okay.
616280	617320	I'm going to slurp my tea,
617320	619160	and then we'll get into shanic heroes.
619160	621000	I've already lost the speed run.
621000	625320	We're already 1 second, 0.98 miller or something.
629480	632040	I'm a sleepy boy, sleepy baby,
632040	633640	but I'm going to have fun.
633640	635000	We're going to play Team Chaotic.
635000	637560	I have never successfully as a child
637560	638920	played Team Chaotic.
638920	641640	The only team I played successfully
641640	644040	was Rose, Team Rose,
644040	645560	which is the easiest team.
645560	647400	Now Chaotic's a bit different.
647400	650440	They have the same map pool, etc.
650440	654520	However, they do little side funny missions
654520	656600	where you don't necessarily have to
656600	658040	reach the end of the lobby.
659400	660600	So we'll have a little...
660600	662360	I never ended up playing most of the Sonic games.
662360	663080	Neither did I.
663080	663720	Please don't worry.
663720	665320	This is literally the only...
665320	666040	I played this.
666040	667240	I played Sonic Unleashed,
667240	670440	but I got stuck as a child in Sonic Unleashed.
671080	672600	I don't know how young I was,
672600	675400	but I was too young to comprehend
675400	676600	what I was supposed to do,
676600	679560	and I got stuck in the first 10 minutes
679560	680600	of Sonic Unleashed.
680600	682600	That's how young I was when I played it.
682600	684040	I don't even know what year it came out,
684040	686360	but I couldn't even figure out the freaking thing.
686920	688440	You never finish this game as a child.
688440	691080	Apparently it's a secret ending if we're 100% it,
691080	692520	so we might return,
692520	693880	because I do have a save file.
694440	695400	I love Sonic Unleashed.
695400	696840	I beat it like 2 years ago.
696920	698200	Ah, Unleashed, Kino.
699160	701400	Wait, so you never saw the final level,
701400	702920	and it has the best OST ever?
703960	705640	In Sonic Heroes?
706360	707320	No, I've not.
708920	711560	The only one I played was the worst one
711560	712760	with all the loading screens.
713320	714120	I don't know what that...
714120	715880	I played Sonic 06.
715880	717080	Small, strong, all we need.
717080	718360	Little, baby, small and so.
719880	721160	Yeah, you have to beat it all the teams.
721160	721720	Oh, okay.
721720	723800	Maybe we'll have a little visit back.
725160	726680	I can't vouch for it.
726680	727880	Yeah, right now, but...
727880	729480	Hold on, let me slurp my tea again.
732200	733320	You got all the emeralds?
733320	735240	I purposely skip the keys.
735240	736520	I don't even pick them up.
736520	737640	I skip them,
737640	739720	because I don't want to do those bonus levels
739720	741400	with the freaking balloons.
741400	743320	They annoy me so much.
744680	746120	Oh, I think it was 2006.
749480	750920	Big nostalgia time.
750920	753560	Yes, Imi from Yumi Plus
753560	756280	is also going on an absolute Sonic boonage.
756280	757560	So if you're a Sonic fan,
757560	758360	I kid you not,
758360	761000	type in ImiYumiPlus.
761800	762440	You're welcome.
762440	763320	That's all I'm saying.
763320	764680	Literally, out of the floodgates,
764680	766600	and she's obsessed with Shadow,
766600	768280	the hedgehog, bless her.
772200	774120	She fucking goes,
774120	775720	Coconuts for Shadow.
775720	776360	Hi, woman.
776360	777480	Hello, we playing.
777480	778920	Sorry for starting early.
778920	780280	I might have jump-scared somebody out.
780280	781720	Whoa, you're too early.
781720	782040	Look.
784360	785320	If I remember correctly,
785320	785960	when you get here,
785960	788120	you aren't allowed to get one hit,
788120	788920	or you perish.
790280	791400	She's totally not down bad
791400	792520	with Shadow for real, for real.
793800	795640	Imi was so nice to me in the end.
796200	797960	So if you didn't know,
797960	799640	Imi is Ozzy.
799640	800360	And I was like,
801000	802040	please for the love of God,
802040	803240	tell me you're in my city.
803240	805320	I will literally do an off collab with you.
805320	807160	You'll be the first person I off collab with.
807800	809880	And she names the wrong bloody city.
811320	814200	I'm like, bruv, it was a 50 fucking 50.
814200	815720	And she's in the wrong one.
817240	818680	She's in the wrong one.
818680	820040	It was a 50 50.
820040	821080	So I'm on the hunt
821720	822520	for a freaking
823240	823960	Melbourne
825400	826200	bloody
826200	828040	a streamer VTuber
828040	829240	that's comfortable with me.
829960	831560	Well, uncomfortable, you know,
831560	832760	lead tubers in general.
833960	834920	Who is Imi?
834920	836520	Imi is from Yumi Plus.
836520	838040	I collabed with her on Among Us,
838040	839880	and I framed her twice in a row.
839880	841000	I'm sorry about that.
841000	841800	I do apologize.
842440	843880	You were very easy to pick on
843880	844520	in my defense.
847160	848840	Hello, Momay reflinks.
848840	849480	Good morning.
850440	853480	Did you miss the chow garden?
853480	855400	I never played that mini game.
855400	856760	You know, never lucky.
858280	861240	So I'm sure there's a Melbourneian VTuber
861240	861960	that's crazy enough
861960	863400	to let me come over to their house.
864840	865560	I'll get it.
866360	867240	I'll get there.
867240	867880	Don't you worry.
867880	874040	Imi is the plague doctor one with red and white.
875080	877880	And I basically gaslit everyone
877880	879560	into thinking it was her.
879560	883000	And she got so she got so taken aback
883000	884440	because no one's heard me.
885240	887160	No, no one's actually heard me
887160	889080	be aggressive or blamey.
889080	890360	Like I've always come.
890360	891400	I'm always chill.
891400	892680	I'm always being chining.
892680	893000	That's all.
893720	895960	So I think everyone was like stunned
895960	897800	that I came out of the gates on Among Us
897880	899160	like it's her.
899160	900280	Here's the here.
900280	901240	It was the candlestick
901240	902920	in the the ball yard room.
902920	903480	Get her.
903480	903800	Okay.
904920	906120	And then we did because I got
906120	907880	a wave that twice in the same lobby
907880	909560	and then she be caught on
909560	911080	to what the deal was going.
911080	913560	So I had to start reversing it and stuff.
915720	917480	Angry Strony was scary but hot.
918680	920440	Well, I don't think anyone expected it.
920440	921800	And I think I took everyone off guard.
921800	922680	So everyone believed me
922680	923880	for like the first two rounds
923880	925000	and then everyone started to get
925000	925960	real sussy of me.
928760	929560	Mmm.
930520	932520	The Scottish Cutfish Reacher for Bean Camp.
934120	935800	Well, sometimes, okay.
936600	939480	But yeah, I think I took everyone off guard
939480	940120	by Among Us.
940120	942600	But I'm currently working on a four-man
942600	944840	collab with people outside of Vealur.
944840	946360	And I'm like, I have to be social.
946360	947240	I'm so scared.
947240	948920	But at the same time, literally no one
948920	950360	has rejected me so far.
950360	952440	So I'm like, hi, I'm Strony.
952440	953320	Do you want a collab?
953320	954840	Here's the time and date.
954840	955320	Show up.
955320	956440	I'll show up in an hour early.
956440	956760	Smile.
957320	961400	Like, people, the way Veach over Twitter
961400	962920	portray everyone being so shy
962920	964200	and scared to talk to each other,
965240	966920	it's actually stopping people
966920	968680	from just straight-up collabing.
968680	969960	You know, you don't have to know
969960	972200	absolutely everything about each other to collab.
972200	974040	I tell a crazy concept.
974040	978280	I know absolutely earth-shattering news.
978280	980920	But every time I've collabed with someone,
980920	982920	they're like, yeah, no one asks me anything.
982920	984440	And I'm like, oh, okay, well,
985240	986920	I'm glad I could break the curse,
986920	989240	because literally you just DM and be like,
989240	991960	hi, I'm Strony from Vealur when I hang out.
991960	992360	Smile.
996120	998200	Need more Vealur Umi Plus collabs?
998760	1001400	Well, hold on to your hat, because August.
1002920	1005080	Unfortunately, I can't really do any collabs this month
1005080	1007080	because of Matt Dad situation.
1008680	1010120	But once he goes home,
1010120	1013880	I am then in a deficit of membership streams.
1013880	1016200	Please don't think I'm neglecting membership streams.
1016200	1017800	There's probably going to be like daily ones.
1019160	1022680	Strony, you have just tremendously metaphorical ballbags.
1022680	1023240	That's all.
1025000	1025800	Oh, who goes there?
1025800	1028440	That's exactly how I get all of the juice.
1035080	1036120	Almost threw up there.
1036120	1037960	If that was lovely first thing in the morning,
1037960	1038760	let's not do that.
1040040	1040520	Tisker.
1041480	1042920	I also have a community post.
1042920	1045480	If you have any words you want me to say in an ASMR,
1045480	1047480	that's going to get recorded like first thing
1048040	1049240	when my dad gets shipped,
1049240	1051000	because when I get sad,
1051000	1052280	I'll just throw myself into work.
1052280	1054440	So don't be surprised when you see a bunch of ASMR
1054440	1055640	come out right at the end of the month.
1057080	1058280	A burpee ASMR.
1058280	1059880	I've already made a burpee ASMR.
1059880	1061000	It's on Patreon right now,
1061000	1062520	but I can't put on YouTube yet,
1062520	1064200	because I have a warning,
1064200	1067160	and I don't know if YouTube is going to give me a strike for it.
1067160	1069320	So I need to wait until the old strike is gone.
1070120	1070920	Anonymous.
1071160	1072280	Nine tenths.
1072280	1074680	Why did you give me $30 for a burpee?
1075240	1077640	Thank you. $30 Anonymous?
1077640	1078440	Nine out of 10.
1078440	1079160	How is that not...
1079160	1081480	Did it need more base for you, sir?
1082200	1084600	Sir, do you require more base with your burps?
1085560	1086760	Sure, anything for you.
1087320	1087560	All right.
1087560	1087800	Okay.
1087800	1088760	I'll finish my teeth.
1088760	1100760	Okay.
1104440	1106280	There are dollars based.
1107320	1108440	Lol, restart my phone.
1108440	1110040	I immediately agreed to a 10 out of 10 bell
1110040	1111640	that you're going to wake up your dad for that one.
1112200	1112600	Lol.
1114200	1116440	A burp that transcends the mortal coil.
1116440	1120120	Mm. Okay.
1122040	1125640	Oh, I just remembered I was going to write a script for Sheebie,
1125640	1126440	and I didn't.
1126440	1126680	Shit.
1128680	1129560	Is she ongoing?
1133800	1137240	Oh, I just remembered I was supposed to do that right now.
1139320	1140200	Okay, it's fine.
1140200	1140840	I have time.
1141960	1142760	I have time.
1143720	1146120	I will teach the girls how to make scripts at a later date.
1146200	1148200	For now, I will do it on their behalf.
1148200	1149320	I will teach them their way.
1149320	1149560	Okay.
1149560	1150840	This is going to get loud.
1150840	1153080	Jumpscare warning for the game sound.
1154200	1154920	There we go.
1161560	1162280	Oh my god.
1163880	1165240	Wait, I can't control the camera.
1166360	1166840	Let's go.
1168200	1169560	Script writing stream instead.
1169560	1171560	No, I can't seem to do it live anymore.
1171560	1172600	I don't know what's going on.
1172600	1176680	Look, it's a little hermit crab.
1177640	1179800	And we're to collect 10 hermit crabs.
1181400	1184200	Um, no louder please.
1187640	1191000	Oh, I'm a bumblebee, so I pollinate the flower.
1191000	1191240	Sorry.
1191240	1191720	I saw.
1191720	1192360	Oh, right.
1192360	1192600	Okay.
1192600	1193480	It's first thing in the morning.
1193480	1194120	Be nice to me.
1199160	1200040	You get the last one.
1200840	1202200	No.
1205000	1208840	I need a level up because so in Sonic Heroes,
1208840	1212040	you have your strength type, you have your flying type,
1212040	1214280	and you have your sneak for speed.
1215160	1220760	I am a bias towards the flying one because this game,
1220760	1224440	you can seriously like, oh my god, look at the hair of it as eyes.
1225720	1227320	That's terrible.
1228200	1229560	I love it more.
1231000	1234840	The pollination mentioned on a little.
1236200	1238520	What's that do a bubble?
1239560	1239800	Right.
1239800	1240760	We're not going for the key.
1240760	1241800	I've had enough key.
1241800	1243480	Why does Gator sound like Uncle Ruckus?
1244200	1245160	Who's Uncle Ruckus?
1245160	1245800	Am I being dumb?
1247960	1248280	Wow.
1249240	1252680	So we are literally our mission isn't to like kill all the robots,
1252680	1253240	get to the end.
1253240	1256120	It's to collect these little adorable hermit crabs.
1257160	1259080	Hey, so let's get to it.
1259560	1260360	Is the cook?
1260360	1264440	Oh god, I've forgotten what button the ultimate is.
1264440	1266520	It says press Z, but there's no Z.
1267640	1268840	I must be a bumper.
1268840	1269880	Surely it's a bumper.
1272440	1274200	There's a little army club.
1274200	1274600	Hello.
1277320	1278440	I have no idea.
1280600	1281800	Oh no, I can't be.
1281800	1282360	All right.
1282360	1282860	Okay.
1289400	1291320	Oh god, I love this game so much.
1291320	1293160	If you didn't know.
1293160	1295960	Wait, was there?
1295960	1297560	No, there wasn't a hermit crab on that one.
1297560	1298040	That's fine.
1299960	1303320	Um, probably right bumper.
1304440	1305560	Oh, not vector.
1310600	1312200	Oh wait, those are level ups.
1312200	1312440	Okay.
1312440	1313160	That's good.
1313160	1318360	Um, but yes, I apologize if this is just absolutely trash string
1318360	1320040	because I can't string a sentence together.
1321000	1322520	The truth is I didn't sleep.
1323240	1325560	I, so my dad took me to Bunnens.
1326360	1329080	So I've got a, I'm going to change the cats.
1330120	1331480	Oh, there's a wee hermit crab.
1331480	1334840	I need to change the cat litter box after this strum.
1335880	1336920	Oh god, I go up.
1337560	1338520	What happens if I go up?
1340760	1341480	Is that up here?
1341480	1343320	There is there a hermit crab up here?
1343320	1343800	Be honest.
1343800	1348520	No, go and get the rest.
1349560	1352680	Hey, so yeah, if I'm quiet, please don't think it's big.
1352680	1353720	Are you okay game?
1354760	1355080	Okay.
1355880	1359880	Please don't think it's because I'm like being a stinky streamer
1359880	1361000	and don't want to talk.
1361000	1364280	It's because I don't have, I didn't know you had a flamethrower.
1364280	1366600	It's because I'm dumb and I didn't sleep,
1366600	1368280	but I'm going to get loads of sleep very shortly.
1368280	1368840	So don't worry.
1371000	1371640	Run.
1373800	1374600	Where's the strong stream?
1374600	1375640	How could it be trash?
1375640	1376600	You're too nice to me.
1378920	1380920	Oh, we have super fast speeds.
1382680	1383080	Wow.
1385320	1385560	Oh.
1387640	1391320	Oh, you didn't see that.
1394840	1396040	That is terrible.
1396840	1399000	You think I was being new to this game or something?
1399560	1401480	No, I'm no, I'm just rubbish.
1401480	1402840	Did you enjoy your steak dinner?
1402840	1406440	No, I didn't end up having it because my dad took me to a cafe
1407480	1409240	and I had like avocado and toast.
1409240	1411480	I know make it more Aussie kidney if I tried.
1412680	1415640	And then we ended up no having the steaks because both of us were full.
1417560	1420760	So we're having chicken instead because we marinated chicken.
1421320	1421880	Right.
1421880	1423720	Wait for the platforms to load.
1423720	1424840	Don't be silly.
1426760	1427080	Okay.
1427080	1427640	There we go.
1427640	1428120	Hold on.
1429000	1429640	Hold on.
1430440	1432440	I need to wait for these platforms to load.
1433720	1435160	Okay.
1436040	1436760	What did we do?
1436760	1437800	We didn't do anything.
1439560	1441160	Oh, there's a we fly there.
1445240	1447000	How is the world domination going?
1447000	1447960	Absolutely terrible.
1447960	1451640	I'm supposed to be the hypnosis and I don't have one hypnosis freaking role play out.
1451640	1453640	But I promise, I promise I will cook.
1453640	1454440	Just let me cook.
1454440	1454680	Okay.
1454680	1455720	I just need some time.
1456600	1458120	I just need some time.
1458120	1458280	Bye.
1458280	1458680	Welcome.
1461080	1461480	And we.
1463800	1464440	No.
1464440	1467640	I thought we were a I thought the map had reset there.
1470120	1470440	Whoa.
1471640	1473080	Are you serious?
1473080	1473960	Oh, okay.
1473960	1476600	I thought that was bad news, but it's actually not that bad news.
1477320	1477560	Right.
1477560	1480360	We just need one more little hermit crab wherever they are.
1481480	1482520	Is there one under here?
1483800	1484360	There it is.
1484360	1484840	I can see it.
1484840	1485320	I can see it.
1485320	1485720	I saw it.
1485720	1486520	I saw a pixel.
1487880	1488520	It's here.
1488520	1489560	I see it.
1489560	1490200	Give me it.
1490840	1491400	We did it.
1492360	1493080	Yeah.
1493080	1493400	See it.
1493400	1494520	Mission one's already done.
1495800	1497720	Avocado on toast is an Aussie thing.
1497720	1499160	So there's been a stereotype.
1499160	1503080	Well, they say like that's why you folk can't afford a house is because they're eating avocado
1503080	1503960	toast and it's like rub.
1505080	1507320	Mummy likes her hypnosis role plays like her steak.
1507320	1507960	Well done.
1508520	1512120	Well, I actually have a four part series that's going on Twitter.
1512120	1516120	I'm need to buy premium Twitter.
1516120	1518680	Elon's got me and bent over a barrel right now.
1519640	1520120	Okay.
1520120	1520600	An E.
1522440	1523880	Stop fooling around.
1523880	1525320	I like the bumblebee's voice.
1525320	1526600	Stop fooling around.
1527400	1527720	Um,
1529640	1530920	it's a four part series.
1530920	1531160	Yeah.
1531160	1532040	I was just going to.
1532040	1535160	So originally it was to go on Patreon, but it's against us.
1535160	1536760	So it's not going on Patreon.
1539000	1539240	Okay.
1539240	1541400	We need to rescue a chocoto.
1543960	1546200	Reeflings forced Johnny to eat a medium steak.
1546200	1547640	No, no.
1547640	1548520	Why?
1548520	1549400	Why not well done?
1550360	1552840	I didn't want, I didn't want it moving.
1553800	1557720	And I didn't want the thought of like little worms in it either.
1557720	1562040	So I said what I said, but if you cook it well done, the worms can't survive.
1562040	1563560	The we eggs can't survive in it.
1564360	1566120	If it's a contaminated.
1569480	1573640	I said what I said, I don't know why well done steak is so controversial.
1574840	1578120	I love when there's a risk of having worms in my steak.
1578120	1578600	No.
1578600	1579400	Said no one ever.
1579400	1580680	No one wants that.
1580680	1581000	Okay.
1581000	1583480	Our objective is just to get to the chocoto.
1583480	1584520	Chocoto?
1584520	1585880	Chocoto.
1585880	1586840	Chocoto.
1586840	1587400	At the end.
1587400	1587800	Oh my God.
1587800	1588120	Cream.
1589320	1591000	Speaking of cream, I cream up.
1591000	1591880	The no stop.
1591880	1592520	That's not funny.
1597640	1599800	How pink does she think medium is?
1599800	1601480	Well, it's still pink in that.
1601480	1603000	So that means it's fucking raw.
1608440	1611960	Okay.
1613160	1615000	I'm starting to catch on to the game.
1615960	1621160	That like helps you level up if you look for the balloons.
1622440	1626600	Only took me how many places to finally get that point across.
1631160	1631720	Stunning.
1633240	1634280	I love the poses.
1635160	1636520	Starting wrong with some pink.
1637240	1639240	I know that shit bubble gum pink.
1639240	1641640	Do you remember when that was fucking everywhere?
1641640	1642680	Oh my God.
1643320	1644840	I know that's bubble gum pink.
1646520	1650120	That's like, I know your knobs are different color than your skin.
1650120	1650760	What the fuck?
1651400	1653800	Because what would the equivalent for a guy be on that?
1656760	1658840	Steak doesn't have parasites, that's fish.
1659880	1661160	Yeah, you want my parasites?
1663880	1665400	Wait, I can't reach.
1665400	1666680	Oh, I was gonna say I'm too tall.
1667960	1668520	Stunning.
1668520	1671240	That pink is my glove in.
1671240	1671800	Munkos.
1674840	1675880	Oh, I'm sorry.
1675880	1676760	I wasn't paying attention.
1676760	1677400	Hold on.
1677400	1678120	I'm popping my...
1681880	1682360	Thank you.
1683720	1684360	Oh my God.
1684360	1685800	I loved the little bumblebee's voice.
1685800	1686280	Sorry.
1686280	1687960	Is it because I can kinda mimic it?
1687960	1690200	In my head, I sound like the bumblebee when I do that,
1690200	1691880	but I bet you I sound nothing like it.
1692840	1695560	No, but I want to taste your fish regardless.
1696120	1697400	I don't think there's a mimic...
1697400	1701640	Well, I thought guys was a...
1701640	1704120	Oh, I just used my ultima.
1705160	1707240	And you're like...
1709320	1714120	Your skin, wink, wink, is like slightly different color?
1715320	1717480	Like it's darker than what your skin color is?
1717480	1719720	Am I going crazy or is that not real?
1719720	1720680	Did I make that up?
1722840	1724920	I'm like trying to be like...
1725800	1726440	I'm like...
1726440	1727480	Okay, no, it's real.
1727480	1728200	Okay, it's real.
1731400	1732040	Okay, okay, okay.
1734520	1735400	No, that's true.
1735400	1735800	Slightly.
1735800	1736600	Huh, I never know if...
1737480	1738280	Yeah, it's darker.
1738280	1741800	Everyone unanimously getting their tentacle art right now
1741800	1743000	just to confirm or deny.
1744760	1746040	We're milling and milling and...
1748360	1751160	Okay, we're already in two missions.
1751160	1753240	We're already on Dr. Eggman.
1756120	1759160	It's darker because it's shrinkable.
1764440	1766760	Shony, you're the first person I've ever had in 20 players
1766760	1768200	two years of being an Islamic fantasy.
1768200	1769320	They like Charmy's voice.
1769880	1772120	Oh wait, the bee's called Charmy.
1772120	1773560	Bee, bee, bee, Charmy.
1776040	1777080	It's so cute.
1781720	1789880	Oh no, he didn't come down here.
1789880	1790280	Oops.
1791080	1791720	Oh, he did.
1792840	1793560	No, he didn't.
1795080	1795800	Please don't hit me.
1797320	1798280	Oopsies.
1798280	1800120	I thought he was supposed to slow down.
1801480	1804040	Now, I missed that one up.
1804040	1805560	Sorry, I went too far ahead.
1806200	1807320	I'm a silly bee.
1807560	1813560	A bumblebee for Gen 2 confirmed purely on the basis of the Sonic Hero character?
1813560	1813800	Yes.
1815640	1816600	And what are you going to do about it?
1816600	1816760	Huh?
1816760	1817560	Are you going to fart?
1817560	1818200	Are you going to cry?
1821400	1824200	Oh, I'm getting smoked.
1824200	1824760	Hold on a minute.
1824760	1825800	I'm getting smoked here.
1825800	1826760	Hold on a minute.
1826760	1827400	Right, here we go.
1828200	1828840	Hey, here we go.
1829640	1830280	We camping.
1831880	1832840	Get him, boys.
1832840	1833320	Get him.
1835400	1836200	Do not move.
1836680	1837320	What are we doing?
1837320	1837800	No, no, no.
1837800	1838200	Don't move.
1838200	1838920	I'm not done yet.
1838920	1839720	I'm not done yet.
1839720	1840120	Hold on.
1841000	1843320	Oh, oh, he's spraying.
1843880	1844840	Don't be so rude.
1844840	1845240	Hold on.
1845240	1845640	I'm not.
1845640	1846200	Hold on.
1846200	1846600	Hold on.
1846600	1847640	I'm too slow.
1847640	1849080	Yeah, I was going to say I'm too slow.
1849080	1850760	Oh, he throws a little ninja star.
1850760	1851880	I never even noticed that.
1853080	1853800	All right, hold on.
1853800	1857400	Wait, come stop here so I can beat you up again.
1858200	1859320	No, I've done it again.
1859320	1860520	How did I keep doing that?
1860520	1860920	Draft.
1862040	1863640	I'm being a silly belly, clearly.
1864200	1865720	Oh, wait.
1865720	1867480	I can attack them while he's moving.
1867480	1868440	Hold on a minute.
1868440	1869160	Hold on a minute.
1869160	1869960	We can do damage.
1869960	1870920	I repeat, we can do damage.
1873320	1875320	Can I do this and they'll attack him for me?
1875960	1877320	Oh, what?
1877320	1878120	I don't know this.
1878120	1880600	Wait, why am I such a silly belly?
1880600	1881960	What happens if I use my ultimate?
1883480	1884200	Can I use it now?
1884840	1886120	Can I use it right against him?
1887160	1888120	I'm not.
1888120	1889080	I'm going burst.
1893720	1894440	Did that work?
1905080	1906200	Did I block the game out?
1908360	1910520	Oh, okay.
1910520	1912280	Maybe don't use your ultimate against them.
1912280	1914440	I'm not sure it's going to make the game go funny.
1914440	1915880	So many things confirmed from Gen2.
1915880	1917320	It's going to be a big gen.
1917320	1919880	Bruh, I cannot wait until you guys actually see
1919880	1921240	what did get accepted.
1921240	1923160	I have been messing around with you guys
1923240	1925640	so much being like, this got accepted in Gen2.
1925640	1926200	This didn't.
1926200	1926920	This got denied.
1926920	1928200	But this got accepted.
1928200	1929640	Oh, I'll take this suggestion.
1929640	1930120	I'll do this.
1930120	1931320	I'll further develop that.
1931320	1933560	I cannot wait for you guys to be strong
1933560	1935160	and you absolute troll.
1936040	1938440	I've literally said no to stuff that isn't.
1941080	1942520	We have here waiting for the trailer.
1944840	1947320	Transformer in Gen2, you stinker.
1947320	1948040	Oh, come on.
1948040	1949000	You have to let me troll.
1950600	1951320	Let's go.
1953400	1954120	What's the mission?
1959640	1959960	Okay.
1961000	1963160	We're to destroy all the enemies in the safe.
1963160	1963800	We can do that.
1969400	1971400	Oh, is there any other?
1971960	1973800	I can't control the camera at all.
1973800	1976440	So if there's an enemy behind me and I've missed it,
1976440	1976840	my bad.
1977880	1979080	Gonna be honest, chief.
1979080	1979640	It's my bad.
1984120	1984680	Here we go.
1984680	1986680	I don't know how to tell if I've done all the enemies.
1986680	1988600	So we've got a number at least.
1988600	1989400	Oh, I don't want bubble.
1989400	1990200	I want level up.
1993160	1994920	So we can...
1998200	1998520	Wait.
1999800	2000280	Oh, no.
2001000	2002200	Are they going to go back up?
2002200	2004520	I need to use espion to get up there.
2005480	2007080	I think his name is espion.
2007080	2008680	Are those things going to come back up?
2008680	2008920	Okay.
2008920	2009240	They are.
2009240	2010440	They are very slowly.
2010440	2011480	They're coming back up.
2011480	2012280	Pfft.
2016280	2018280	We know you well enough that you're lying
2018280	2020520	and we let you get away with it.
2021080	2023000	It wasn't buggering thin fly transformation
2023000	2023640	thundershot.
2023640	2025800	Just doesn't do direct damage at 0 or 1.
2025800	2027640	They'll find enemies still take damage.
2027640	2028840	I don't know.
2028840	2029320	Okay.
2029320	2032760	One, two, three, four, five.
2034040	2034360	Okay.
2036440	2036840	Wah.
2037480	2040840	I don't like those tanks.
2040840	2041640	They scare me.
2048600	2048920	Wait.
2048920	2050920	Does that count as destroying them?
2050920	2051880	That does not count.
2051880	2053240	It's just frozen the guys.
2054280	2054680	Oh, no.
2054680	2054920	Wait.
2054920	2055560	Hold on.
2055560	2056680	Did the number just go up there?
2056680	2057560	Am I making that up?
2058840	2061480	I am pushing against the current as hard as I can.
2062040	2064680	I think I'm going to have to wait for them to fly back up.
2065640	2067000	Are they actually down there?
2067800	2068200	No.
2068200	2069320	They must have been destroyed.
2069320	2069880	There's no way.
2070520	2072280	If we messed up the game,
2073320	2075480	so this is where I got stuck as a child
2075480	2077240	and I've not gone any further than this.
2080760	2081240	Fly.
2081240	2081880	So it's fly.
2081880	2082120	Okay.
2082120	2082680	I'll fly.
2082680	2083320	I'll trust it.
2085560	2090040	I'm going to level up the B fully just because.
2090040	2094840	Oh, there's two enemies here.
2095560	2096840	I just want to make sure I get them.
2096840	2098680	I don't want to like move on by accident.
2102200	2102680	I'm stuck.
2103320	2103720	Oh God.
2103720	2104600	I'm so bad at this.
2104600	2105320	I'm so sorry.
2107640	2108680	It's because there's a pit.
2109720	2111000	If it wasn't Haram,
2111000	2114520	I would bet $100 that Gen 2 includes a slime or a horse girl.
2114840	2115320	Mm.
2118120	2119960	Is it because I've made such a deal
2119960	2121800	about like not liking slime girls?
2121800	2124440	I wonder if that's why I think that.
2124440	2125400	Is there anything in here?
2125400	2126200	No, there's a switch.
2126200	2127320	What does the switch do?
2127320	2130120	Oh, it lets me access to the level up.
2130120	2130600	I'll take it.
2136120	2136680	Okay.
2137320	2139080	One, two, three, four.
2140840	2142360	31 out of 85.
2142360	2144200	Wait, we've actually still got quite a bit
2144680	2144760	to go.
2144760	2145560	Is that a yes?
2146120	2148040	No, I'm not confirming anything.
2148040	2150840	I'm just saying that I've been an absolute troll
2150840	2152760	and I've said yes to stuff that isn't happening
2152760	2156360	and I've said no to stuff that is happening.
2158520	2159480	Oh, I didn't mean to do that.
2159480	2161000	I should have done that on SP1.
2161000	2161480	My bad.
2164760	2165800	Ext interact.
2166440	2167560	Slime cinch.
2169240	2170600	Okay, hold on a minute.
2170600	2172040	I'm not sure how much I can actually
2172040	2174360	hide my real disdain for some of the suggestions.
2174920	2177400	We are going to have a carry on next week
2177400	2179560	and I'm going to draw your gen 2 suggestions
2179560	2184920	because I'm about to get all the concepts given,
2185720	2186680	which by...
2189080	2190440	Oh, they're falling from the sky.
2191480	2192760	Oh, yeah, from the sky.
2195320	2195560	Oh.
2198360	2201320	Okay, don't, no, don't, don't attack.
2201320	2202360	I guess...
2202360	2204120	Wait, SP1 just...
2207000	2208520	He just turned it on his arse?
2211000	2212040	Oh, I didn't mean to do that.
2212040	2213000	No, go back.
2213000	2213800	No, go back.
2214360	2215560	Go back right now.
2215560	2216360	I saw that.
2219240	2220120	What am I shooting at?
2222040	2223160	Wait, how do I get back up?
2224200	2225080	Ah, okay, okay, okay.
2225720	2226200	Let's...
2226200	2226520	No!
2227960	2228360	Ah.
2229880	2230680	Okay, hold on.
2230680	2234360	If I hover and then shoot, surely.
2234360	2234680	Yes.
2236040	2236520	One more.
2239240	2240840	M-m-more skills.
2241640	2243480	Level 3, honing attack.
2244040	2246280	Homing attack is the tornado.
2246280	2246600	Wow.
2247960	2249000	Is there an enemy down here?
2249720	2249960	No.
2251080	2252280	I'm just getting trolled, right?
2252280	2255080	Bumblebee time, sweet little bumblebee.
2255080	2257160	I know what you want to be.
2258040	2261160	I'm out of range.
2261960	2262520	Oh, man.
2264520	2266840	I'm being super safe with the bumblebee.
2266840	2267640	I love him.
2267640	2269960	And it means I can do damage from...
2269960	2271960	Oh, well, that looks like a hymn.
2278680	2280040	Oh, I almost missed it.
2281640	2282760	Oh, no, I didn't.
2282760	2285000	Right, so can you destroy the tank now?
2285880	2287080	He can do it on his own.
2287080	2288440	He doesn't need, like, health.
2289160	2290440	That's amazing.
2290440	2292120	All the girls will be muppified.
2292120	2293960	Toma keys, count your days.
2293960	2294520	Toma...
2294520	2298600	If you didn't see it, Toma keys did it to Zura.
2298600	2300680	I have never interacted with Toma keys,
2300680	2302680	but count your days, my girl.
2302680	2303560	I'm coming for you.
2304360	2305880	You muppify in my...
2305880	2308760	Do you know how much money I spent on Zura's design
2309800	2310920	in her model?
2310920	2312600	And you come along and muppify?
2315560	2317880	Oh, it's absolutely hilarious.
2317880	2318600	I love seeing it.
2319720	2321160	Tea bag in the crap out of it.
2321160	2322200	Please drop down.
2322200	2322840	Drop.
2322840	2323000	Drop.
2323640	2324200	Drop down.
2324200	2324760	There you go.
2326920	2328520	Muppet strongy win.
2328520	2329640	Toma, you better not.
2331720	2332360	A muppet?
2333000	2334600	Why do I look like a muppet to you?
2335720	2337880	Two seconds later, it's muppified.
2339640	2340120	Right.
2340120	2342760	It's telling me to use him to aim.
2342760	2343080	Okay.
2345560	2347960	So, no, that was X.
2347960	2348440	I was wrong.
2350920	2351240	What?
2353400	2354680	Does that don't work?
2354680	2355880	How does that shoot?
2355880	2357400	Are you squidding me right now?
2357400	2358680	I said I'm working.
2358680	2359080	Tiny.
2359080	2360520	Sorry, I'm late, strongy.
2360520	2362280	How's it going so far?
2362280	2363400	It's going good.
2363400	2364680	We are playing...
2364680	2366360	Don't apologize for being late.
2366360	2368200	I actually started 10 minutes early,
2368200	2369400	which you're not supposed to do,
2369400	2371800	but I did it because I'm such a naughty VTuber.
2375080	2376760	We're playing Team Chaotic.
2376760	2380200	We're doing ones that I'm not too familiar with.
2382600	2385240	I've never won on him before on this team.
2387640	2389320	But I'm trying my best,
2389320	2390840	and that's the most important thing.
2393160	2394840	But thank you for the tip, Tiny Spine.
2396600	2397640	Muppet allure.
2397640	2398200	Stop it.
2399400	2400680	Stop saying such thing.
2400680	2402360	Are you trying to upset me on purpose?
2402360	2406600	Power is control of the canyon.
2409400	2409960	Ah!
2409960	2410680	Did I just hurt?
2410680	2411880	Oh, I didn't hurt myself there.
2413080	2416120	I didn't have fun with the later levels in this game mode.
2419160	2419640	Oh well.
2420440	2423240	Okay, we're at 73 of 85 enemies.
2423240	2424280	Okay, okay.
2424280	2426280	I have no idea if we've missed any.
2426280	2427720	I have a feeling we probably have.
2430280	2431480	Team Chaotic hurt me.
2431480	2433720	Oh no, that picked like the most awkward team.
2435960	2438520	I have no idea if there's like secret enemies behind me.
2438520	2440840	I feel like there probably is.
2444200	2445160	I'll handle it.
2449400	2450040	Okay, there we go.
2451960	2452440	Wow.
2454520	2457000	Right, we'll do this so we can shoot at the guy.
2457640	2458840	Use the X button.
2459960	2461320	Use the X button.
2462520	2465080	Do we need to turn back for the railings?
2467320	2469960	Surely they wouldn't put an enemy on the railings,
2469960	2471560	like down the other sides.
2471560	2474760	No, this game is very friendly.
2476040	2477480	Oh wow, we just killed three.
2477480	2478520	Wait, we've got four more.
2478520	2479960	Please tell me there's four at the.
2479960	2482360	Whoa, I see a little hidden thing to the left.
2483160	2483960	Did you see that?
2485240	2486760	Team Sonic is normal mode.
2486760	2487240	Oh no.
2488760	2490200	Have I missed two?
2492840	2495640	We got a complete Peer League before we get map attack.
2495640	2497160	You're not getting it.
2498200	2499880	Chaotic is mission mode.
2499880	2501880	Thank you for the tip, Broly legend.
2502600	2504040	Oh, thank goodness we did it.
2505640	2506760	I actually have come.
2506760	2508120	Oh, right.
2508120	2508440	Hold on.
2508440	2509160	Let's just nuke them.
2511240	2513000	I think we're actually going to do it.
2513000	2514920	I've never gone past this point
2514920	2516920	because I got stuck on this one in childhood.
2516920	2518280	I don't know what I got stuck on though.
2518280	2519720	That seems really straightforward.
2524920	2526200	I think Emelur.
2527960	2530280	Emelur sounds like custom manure.
2531240	2534120	The P and Peeler stood for puppets this entire time.
2537080	2538280	It's up to Azura.
2538280	2540280	The Peeler allegations are complete.
2541320	2542280	It's not up to me.
2542280	2543240	It's up to Azura.
2544200	2546840	I'm just on standby, okay?
2546840	2547880	I'm on standby.
2552040	2553080	Now you're not child anymore.
2553080	2554440	You can fight your inner demons.
2555560	2557720	Right, there are the Golden Turtle robots.
2557720	2559640	The turtles control the system.
2560760	2563160	Sorry, I'm talking over the literal commentary.
2563160	2566040	We're to find and destroy Golden Turtles.
2570360	2572600	Okay, Hydration Tech replays.
2574200	2575800	That's not a Golden Turtle though.
2577880	2578840	Okay, I don't want a key.
2580440	2580840	Let's go.
2582760	2583800	If you do it, I'll do it.
2583800	2585080	Type of friend.
2585080	2585880	Pretty much, yeah.
2587400	2591480	I was so surprised by the girls when we handed over the Twires.
2591480	2592440	But I'm like, hold on a minute.
2592440	2593480	You guys are onto something.
2596840	2597720	Use thundershoot.
2600040	2601320	What team did you like best?
2601320	2604280	Rose, because I'm rubbish at games.
2604280	2606840	And it's a girl team.
2606840	2609960	And I might be a girl.
2609960	2610600	And I don't know.
2610600	2611640	I just kind of...
2611640	2613320	Oh, why is that locked up?
2615640	2616920	Why is that locked up?
2620360	2622520	Oh. Charming.
2623720	2625000	Oh, someone leveled up.
2625000	2626680	A crocodile leveled up.
2626680	2628440	I need another one though.
2628440	2630120	I need it for the flight.
2630120	2631480	My charming bumblebee.
2631480	2632840	I love my charming bumblebee.
2635400	2636280	Come on.
2636280	2639080	No, he's like shocking them as they come down.
2639080	2640680	Estrani's a girl.
2640680	2641560	I know.
2641560	2643080	It's absolutely horrifying.
2643800	2646360	Is there like a secret level up over here, please?
2646360	2647800	Wait, there actually is.
2648520	2649720	Oh, no.
2649720	2650680	I thought there was a level up.
2650680	2651800	Okay, we've been lied to.
2652680	2656040	Unconfirmed being a girl allegation.
2656040	2657000	Shock and behavior.
2658120	2659000	Shock and behavior.
2660200	2661720	No, go for the other guy.
2661720	2662760	No, the other guy.
2662760	2663800	He's right there.
2664680	2666520	Oh, they take damage if they fall down.
2668440	2669880	Why does he keep getting the level up?
2669880	2671080	Give it to the flight.
2671080	2673160	Stop giving it to the strength guy.
2678520	2679400	How do I kill it?
2681480	2681960	You know what?
2681960	2683960	I'm gonna just kick and then get my ultimate
2683960	2684600	and then do this.
2684920	2689640	Look, it's a little bit cheesy doodling,
2689640	2691160	but it works.
2691160	2691560	Okay.
2693640	2695720	And if it works, who am I to complain?
2695720	2696200	Thank you.
2698440	2699880	Am I supposed to do the stripy?
2699880	2701400	Oh, it's a switched open up.
2702200	2702920	Oh, right.
2702920	2703160	Okay.
2703160	2705560	That makes a lot more sense than I was like, hmm.
2707960	2709720	Death by bad singing.
2712360	2713400	Am I supposed to go up?
2713400	2714600	Is this one of them hidden things?
2714600	2715800	Oh, it bloody is.
2719480	2720760	I hate when there's like a path
2720760	2722280	and you're not sure which one's the right one.
2722280	2723240	Oh, well, there you go.
2723960	2724200	Wait.
2726280	2727640	Is he gonna get me?
2727640	2728920	Can you aim for the...
2728920	2729240	Can you...
2730840	2731800	God, right.
2731800	2732360	I'm just gonna...
2735800	2736200	Hello?
2739880	2740120	Yeah.
2740120	2741560	No wonder you fell off the map.
2741560	2742280	What was that?
2743800	2744760	What was that?
2744760	2746680	I mean, what even was that?
2746680	2749880	I think the game kicks Charmin
2749880	2752120	all the way in place of like Vespion
2752120	2753800	when I threw him or whatever his freaking name is.
2754440	2755400	That was bizarre.
2756680	2758040	I'm just gonna fly and...
2758920	2760840	Oh, no, I lost all my charge.
2763960	2764360	I don't...
2765240	2766360	Do you want to kick those?
2767800	2769880	No, I'm scared to like kick,
2769880	2770680	but he's here.
2771640	2772120	Right.
2772120	2774280	I'm literally just camping on top and kicking.
2775080	2777240	The game hates Vespion.
2777240	2778200	Oh, come on.
2778200	2779320	I don't know the names.
2779320	2779560	Right.
2780120	2782840	Write the names of my team in Chaotic.
2782840	2783480	I don't know.
2784200	2785640	Charming is one.
2785640	2786760	The game's slippery.
2787560	2788920	Stoney, you can't hit them from there.
2788920	2790520	Well, I need to be up at them.
2790520	2792600	I'm just gonna farm my ultimate.
2792600	2794440	You see that blue bar at the top, right?
2798120	2798840	Whoa.
2798840	2799800	Well, I did something.
2800440	2801080	Okay, we got it.
2801640	2803560	Charming could have saved themselves,
2803560	2805160	but they should have stayed with friends.
2805160	2805480	Oh.
2806360	2811240	Okay, we've got two turtle doves and a partridge and a pear tree.
2811240	2811720	And then what?
2811720	2813480	I'll just go back down here again.
2813480	2814520	Oh my god, camera angle.
2814520	2815480	Please work with me.
2816280	2817640	It really is...
2817640	2820040	I don't know why it's not letting me manipulate the camera.
2821800	2822680	I'll stick to it.
2822680	2823480	We charming.
2824120	2825160	Vespion.
2825720	2826680	Vespion.
2827640	2828920	Charming in the power guy.
2829000	2829880	You know what?
2829880	2832280	You've literally given me nothing to work with.
2832920	2838120	And you will be punished for your sins against me.
2840200	2841240	Oh, there's a railing.
2843320	2844840	I'll collect coins.
2846120	2847480	Do not read that.
2847480	2847720	Yeah.
2849080	2850440	What does that mean?
2850440	2851000	I don't know.
2853240	2854440	Okay, one, two.
2855240	2857000	Oh, I lost all my level ups.
2857560	2858040	Man.
2859880	2860840	Charly...
2860840	2861720	Oh, no.
2861720	2863240	Vector the crocodile.
2864200	2866840	Espio the chameleon.
2868200	2869160	And a bumblebee.
2869160	2870680	Charmybee the bumblebee.
2870680	2872280	Sweet little bumblebee.
2872280	2873160	I do like him.
2877480	2878120	Wow.
2880120	2880600	Right.
2880600	2885480	We just need one more golden little turtle enemy.
2885880	2886680	All right.
2886680	2888600	I sense gold.
2889800	2890280	Okay.
2890280	2891400	And I sense nothing.
2894920	2895640	Ah, sorry.
2895640	2897400	I love this flower teleport mechanic.
2897400	2899080	This is the cutest thing I've ever seen.
2899800	2900520	I don't care.
2900520	2901960	I'll take 12 more of them, please.
2903800	2904040	Okay.
2904040	2905000	You, Peri.
2905000	2908120	If I slam down around them, do they become attack balls?
2908120	2909080	I think they do.
2909800	2912760	Because he's getting hurt, but I'm not actually doing anything to him.
2913400	2914920	I can't see the enemy.
2915560	2916120	Where is it?
2916120	2916840	Oh, there is.
2916840	2919960	I found the enemy right in front of my face.
2920920	2922360	It was on the lower floor?
2922360	2923640	Oh, don't see that.
2923640	2925000	Have I just done a circle?
2926360	2927480	Oh, no.
2927480	2929240	Is this the start of the map?
2930360	2931400	Fua!
2931400	2934040	How was your first YouTube stream?
2935320	2936840	Hi, Fua and Gain.
2939080	2940680	Fua, if you didn't know,
2941560	2946440	Fua, if you didn't know, had her first YouTube stream very recently.
2947400	2948680	But hi, Raiders.
2948680	2949880	Amstwarnica...
2949880	2950200	I...
2950200	2951800	You do not have a wrench and hammer.
2951800	2952440	Hold on.
2952440	2953320	Can I do it?
2953320	2953720	Hold on.
2953720	2954120	Hold on.
2954120	2955240	I know the music just cut out.
2955240	2956120	Wait, I need to give...
2956120	2957080	Must give wrench and hammer.
2957080	2958040	Must give wrench and hammer.
2959720	2961000	Whoa, whoa, hello.
2961000	2961400	Hi.
2962200	2964360	Just for the Raiders, Amstwarnica,
2965560	2966440	from Violaure.
2967000	2968680	That's right, the porn company.
2968680	2969000	Sorry.
2969160	2969800	All right.
2972760	2975160	And we're playing Sonic Heroes,
2975160	2976040	a little childhood game,
2976040	2977240	but yeah, if you didn't know,
2977240	2978520	for the Reeflings, actually,
2978520	2980520	Fua just had her first YouTube,
2980520	2981640	a little stream,
2981640	2983160	and she was really nervous for it.
2983160	2983640	What's that?
2983640	2984440	I watched it.
2984440	2985240	Yes, I did.
2985240	2985640	I know.
2985640	2986520	I can't believe it.
2986520	2986920	I haven't...
2986920	2987640	I have many a time.
2988360	2989320	Boom, like that.
2989320	2990600	Just like that, you stand it.
2992120	2994040	Get wrenched, get wrenched, get wrenched, honestly.
2995720	2996680	Okay, how's that?
2997640	2998360	That look good?
2999640	3001160	I'm just making sure the stream
3001160	3002440	isn't playing in the background,
3002440	3004440	and then it doubles up on audio by accident.
3004440	3004920	There we go.
3005480	3007640	Okay, we sadly have missed the turtle.
3009000	3010440	So I think we have to replay
3010440	3011880	through this entire section again.
3014280	3015240	Maybe, possibly.
3016280	3017240	The audio's fine.
3019240	3022680	I need one golden turtle.
3022680	3023880	I can't find it.
3025480	3027400	Okay, I do love the game for that.
3027400	3029320	I hope your stream has been going well.
3029320	3030680	It's been amazing, honestly.
3030680	3033080	I've been spoiled by my reeflings.
3035400	3038760	So I couldn't have asked for a better streaming time,
3038760	3039080	honestly.
3039080	3040520	It's only been a month, but well,
3040520	3041800	actually, nope.
3041800	3043160	We're getting close to two months.
3044680	3045640	Can I do army?
3045640	3047240	Oh, we're almost halfway through July.
3047240	3049960	Yeah, almost one and a half months.
3049960	3050680	Let's fucking go.
3050680	3052040	Oh, I love streaming.
3052040	3052920	Oh my god.
3052920	3053720	I love my life.
3057720	3060600	Oh god, I'm so out of it right now.
3063400	3065160	There's one up ahead.
3065160	3066440	Someone's waiting for me right now.
3066440	3066920	Whoa!
3068040	3069160	Not from Veiler.
3069160	3070360	That was not supposed to happen.
3071240	3072360	Hi, Broly Legend.
3072360	3073400	Thank you for the tip.
3073400	3074600	I said hi, Broly Legend.
3075560	3078120	What do you use the not the Veiler for Peeler?
3078120	3078680	Damn, already.
3078680	3080280	It feels like a debut just happened.
3080280	3081800	Time goes by so fast.
3081800	3083800	It's not even possible to keep up.
3085560	3087000	I hope there's a guy here.
3087880	3088600	Is he here?
3092280	3093960	Okay, maybe I'm starting to understand
3093960	3096440	why this is like such a long game.
3098600	3100200	I didn't think they were bad.
3105080	3106440	Man, Fletcher and Gage are really good.
3109560	3110840	Am I going in circles?
3110840	3111640	Did I miss it?
3114280	3115320	Oh, we found them.
3115320	3115960	We found them.
3115960	3117800	Literally, all we have to do is nuke them.
3122920	3124360	Ah, we did it, we did it, we did it.
3125000	3125560	Let's go.
3125560	3126520	Next level.
3126520	3127480	He was back there.
3127480	3128680	Oh, well, I found another one.
3128680	3130760	I guess they must put multiple on the maps
3130760	3132360	in case like you get stuck
3132360	3133560	because no one wants to be stuck.
3137320	3139960	Slonic hero stages are notoriously big.
3139960	3142520	That took me eight minutes to kill three things.
3143320	3144360	That's how long that took.
3144360	3145800	That's shocking behavior.
3145880	3146360	Shawnton.
3149400	3151720	Okay, stop fooling around.
3151720	3154200	Okay, stop fooling around.
3155400	3158920	Yeah, no, maybe I was the voice actor
3158920	3160680	for Charming, maybe?
3161400	3162600	A little Charming roleplay.
3163640	3166920	Look at them pixelated yetis.
3166920	3168760	I don't know how pixelated it comes across
3168760	3173080	on your screen, but I can feel the pixels on my end.
3173080	3176120	Who's this broad?
3177320	3179160	You mean the bad guys?
3179160	3180840	You mean the bad guys?
3183960	3186680	Team Darkseid just taking like 16 minutes long.
3186680	3187160	Oh, god.
3189160	3190360	I don't know how to fight.
3193320	3194200	What am I doing?
3194200	3194840	Oh, my god, stop.
3196120	3197800	Give me the freaking B level up.
3197800	3198040	Go.
3198680	3200040	I'm freaking scared.
3200600	3203480	I'm scared.
3203480	3203960	I'm scared.
3203960	3204520	Give me the B.
3204520	3205560	Okay, we've got the B level up.
3205560	3206120	That's all we need.
3206120	3207080	We're level two on the B.
3207800	3208840	Get off the map.
3208840	3209800	Get off the map.
3209800	3210520	Off the map.
3210520	3211240	Off it.
3211240	3211960	Off it.
3211960	3212360	Off it.
3213480	3214760	No, they got me.
3218200	3219240	Get off the map.
3219240	3219960	Get off the map.
3220920	3222920	Okay, we got rid of the bat apparently.
3226760	3227560	I'm scared.
3228520	3230760	Okay, they're just like a pair of stunlocks right now.
3230760	3231320	I'll take it.
3232760	3233720	Get off the map.
3235640	3236360	Get off it.
3236360	3238200	He's just got nuts down there.
3238200	3238840	Where is he?
3241800	3242600	Oh, there he was.
3242600	3243000	He's there.
3243000	3243400	He's there.
3243400	3243880	I see him.
3244920	3245800	Go away, Shadow.
3246360	3247240	Get off the map.
3248760	3249560	Oh, I'm freaking sick.
3250520	3252120	I don't know how to do this, honestly.
3254040	3254840	Okay, hold on.
3254840	3256200	He's actually annihilating me.
3256200	3256840	I'm using my ult.
3256840	3257560	I'm using my ult.
3260200	3262360	I don't know how to throw him off the map though.
3263480	3264840	I'm just going to spam with...
3264840	3265880	We charm in.
3265880	3266600	Okay, there we go.
3266600	3267400	Okay, we ulted.
3267400	3269160	Giving them the silver treatment.
3269160	3271480	Wait till Shadow uses his special technique.
3271480	3272040	A gun.
3274440	3275480	Okay, yeah, I did that.
3275480	3275960	That's right.
3275960	3276520	Give me an A.
3278840	3279960	And why was that a C?
3279960	3281800	I did it in under two minutes.
3281800	3282280	A C?
3282280	3283640	Shouldn't that not be a B then,
3283640	3285160	if it's supposed to be under a minute?
3286760	3287640	I want to play!
3296920	3298280	Yeah, if anyone is like...
3299640	3302280	Just spam tornadoes to speed character
3302280	3304680	and you win in less than 10 seconds.
3304680	3306440	They weren't walking in moe tornadoes.
3308360	3311000	Thank you for the tip, tiny spiny.
3311000	3312120	Quite literally with the game.
3312120	3313320	Right, what was the objective?
3313320	3314360	I wasn't paying attention.
3316520	3317960	Oh, get coins.
3317960	3319880	Look, top left, it says get coins.
3327080	3327560	I don't know.
3329080	3329400	Whoa.
3330920	3332520	The triggers are reversed.
3332520	3334040	They're on the wrong side.
3334040	3334280	What?
3335160	3336920	When I do left and right, it's wrong.
3338440	3339000	Okay, hold on.
3339000	3340440	I need swaps of one of the others
3340440	3341240	because I'm getting nowhere.
3342920	3344200	Okay, did that help?
3344200	3345080	Is that where I want to go?
3345880	3347400	Oh, that level up feels good for me.
3349480	3350920	I need to get what?
3352280	3353880	I'm trying to get up, I am.
3353880	3354840	I'm trying to get up.
3354840	3355880	Okay, we did it, we did it.
3358280	3359400	200 rings.
3359400	3361560	Okay, wait, this is like straight gamble.
3369000	3370120	Well, if we just need coins,
3370680	3371960	did I kill that guy back here?
3371960	3372280	I did.
3375160	3376280	Oh, no, I picked up the key.
3377560	3379720	Oh, I really don't want to do any of those missions.
3380520	3382120	I accidentally got the key.
3382120	3382520	Oops.
3384440	3385480	Oopsie, whoopsie.
3394200	3398920	Yeah, for anyone that wondered why I base off the OSTs,
3399800	3403080	just listen to the music and appreciate what it's like.
3403080	3405720	It's just so beautifully crafted.
3405720	3406600	Maybe not this part,
3407480	3409880	but it's supposed to show falling into descent.
3416920	3418760	Whoa, no, come on.
3418760	3419560	I was doing it.
3421320	3426360	I can't, it won't let me select the guy that's stuck in the machine.
3426360	3427880	I could have gambled that, come on.
3434040	3435240	Casino.
3435240	3436280	I can't get inside.
3438040	3438360	What?
3441160	3442520	Okay, no, go in.
3443240	3443480	What?
3445480	3447480	He is bugging out on that thing.
3447480	3448840	I can hear it from over here.
3452680	3454280	I'm so sorry for that noise.
3454280	3456120	The game, he's stuck in here.
3457240	3458520	I can't even push him out.
3459320	3463080	Oh, I pushed this out somehow.
3463080	3464040	I don't know how I did that.
3465560	3467640	$2, give me more coins.
3470440	3472360	No, I'm trying to get out of this section.
3473240	3474600	Yes, there we go.
3474600	3475880	Okay, let's go in here.
3475880	3476280	Jeez.
3480680	3481880	Okay, we did it.
3481880	3483640	I hate when I can't get inside too.
3483640	3485720	I was freaking so stuck there.
3486840	3487560	Try my best.
3489240	3492040	Uh, we've apparently lost Speedy Gonzales.
3498120	3501960	We've just straight up lost someone up for the speed character.
3504040	3505800	Nope, how much do we need?
3505800	3507160	We need 70 more coins.
3509880	3511480	We've like straight up lost him.
3511480	3512600	He's not even respawning.
3513960	3515800	Now she'll lose the house to Gamba.
3516680	3517720	Espo dead.
3517720	3519080	He's literally popped his clogs.
3519080	3519720	He's had enough.
3520600	3522120	I mean, I hope we can progress.
3527400	3527720	What?
3528920	3531320	I really hope we're not going to get a section
3531320	3533640	where we need him because hello.
3538920	3540440	Oh, I did not mean to do that.
3541080	3547960	I'm going to be the bumblebee in case we get put into a very unique situation in a minute
3547960	3552360	because why is it not spawning him back in?
3556440	3559160	With him gone, you will know smell the cold.
3559880	3561240	He got lost in the Gamba.
3561240	3562840	That's exactly why I didn't show up.
3562840	3563400	See kids?
3566040	3566280	No.
3567400	3567640	Whoa.
3570760	3571720	Okay, we did it.
3571720	3572920	I don't know how, but we did it.
3575480	3577480	Is this not a jump against the wall one?
3579560	3580520	Okay, it's this one.
3582120	3582920	What are we looking at?
3582920	3583240	Come on.
3583240	3584440	We must be close by now.
3587000	3588520	I need to destroy these guys.
3588520	3589160	Let's just do that.
3590200	3590920	Espo back.
3590920	3592680	He paid his Gamba debts back.
3593960	3596840	Actually, I wanted to ask you about the...
3601000	3601240	What?
3602040	3603480	Why did we win?
3603480	3605320	Because we destroyed enemies?
3605320	3606840	I mean, I guess you get money.
3607480	3609080	I had to wait to say five minutes.
3609080	3610040	Oh, I'm so sorry.
3610040	3611800	I apologize to any Fuwa.
3612920	3613400	Enjoy.
3613400	3614040	I'm so sorry.
3614040	3615480	I'm probably butchering her name as well.
3615480	3618600	My accent, Fuwa the Neko Vtuber.
3619400	3621720	Thank you to anyone who's binchening.
3621720	3624040	She had a fantastic first little YouTube stream.
3624040	3627320	You got 218 rings from that fight.
3627320	3628920	Okay, I'll remember that.
3628920	3631480	If there's another money mission, I'll try and remember that.
3633480	3635480	That Yakuza game.
3635480	3637960	Is the Yakuza games good to play on stream?
3637960	3640120	Like, am I going to be able to play them on stream?
3640120	3641880	Because I am interested in them.
3641880	3642760	I'm not going to let...
3642760	3645240	No, I don't want to play the freaking...
3645240	3646760	I accidentally picked up the key.
3648760	3649640	Forgive me.
3650840	3652280	Oh, see, that's what I don't like.
3652280	3653960	I randomly yank your momentum.
3656440	3658120	Oh my god, but it's so Kawaii-ne though.
3658120	3658760	Hold on a minute.
3658760	3659960	The music cannot be jamming.
3661640	3662120	Oh my god.
3663880	3665000	Oh, it's so Kawaii-ne though.
3666200	3667720	What am I supposed to do?
3667720	3668280	I don't know.
3672520	3673320	Okay, okay.
3674120	3674680	Okay.
3674680	3675640	Don't hurt him now.
3675640	3676440	Don't hurt him now.
3677480	3678920	Oh, sugar rush.
3681480	3681880	Wow.
3683880	3684360	I assume...
3685720	3687800	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
3687880	3689160	Okay, yeah, I'm sorry.
3690040	3691240	I couldn't do it.
3691240	3691880	I suck.
3692680	3692920	No!
3694760	3695240	Are we done?
3699320	3700040	Hydration check.
3700040	3701640	I'm currently hogging the microphone
3701640	3703800	because I freaking picked up the thing wrong.
3706040	3706440	Okay.
3708680	3709000	Oh.
3710280	3711640	Sorry if you get motion sick.
3711640	3713400	This probably isn't the scene for you right now.
3713400	3714680	Oh no, not the bombs.
3715240	3718280	Oh wait, I'm running out of time at the bottom?
3719560	3721080	Oh my god, I have to get through this level.
3721080	3721640	What the heck?
3729640	3732280	Oh, I'm out of speed boosts.
3732280	3733320	I'm out of speed boosts.
3733320	3734040	Oh, we made it.
3734040	3734520	It's fine.
3734520	3735160	Plenty of time.
3735160	3735720	Jeez.
3735720	3736040	Right.
3736040	3737480	Do not let me pick up a key again.
3737480	3738840	I do not like that.
3738840	3740200	I'm literally hogging the microphone.
3740200	3740600	I am.
3740600	3741480	I've got a big man.
3741480	3742280	Not I'm something.
3744680	3747000	Team Chaotix blasts give tons of rings.
3747000	3749240	I wonder, I guess maybe because it's their thing.
3749240	3750680	Oh, we got two lives out of that.
3750680	3751240	I mean, sure.
3751240	3753400	I'm probably going to throw myself off the map somehow.
3755640	3756600	Bingo highly.
3757560	3757960	Uh-huh.
3761320	3761720	Uh-huh.
3764920	3768040	This is the song that my theme song is based after.
3770600	3772360	Notice how it goes ear to ear.
3772920	3775400	My background music goes ear to ear.
3775400	3776760	If you listen, nice thing.
3776760	3779000	Oh, let's try it again.
3779000	3779320	Hold on.
3783880	3785960	I think I wasn't supposed to do it that way, but we did it.
3788600	3792440	Strony's panic when she realizes Sonic games want her to go fast.
3797800	3798120	Okay.
3799080	3799800	Oh, dear.
3799800	3801560	That's not the best outcome for that.
3807400	3808280	Oh, I love this.
3812840	3814280	A very important chip.
3816440	3821320	Oh, I'm so sleep deprived, but this song is so good.
3825080	3825560	No.
3825560	3830200	Oh, I need to level everyone up.
3832680	3832920	Okay.
3832920	3833560	What does this do?
3836760	3838280	Well, hold on.
3838280	3840200	I need to give you your motherfucking wrench.
3841320	3841960	I show you, Ms.
3843000	3846360	You're being punished by becoming a moderator.
3847960	3849000	Yeah, you have been punished.
3849000	3849800	Congrats.
3849800	3850600	Do not resist.
3852040	3853240	Well, it's running.
3853960	3861400	How the last time we saw Mismar was, um, give me a wrench and I'll get right or
3861400	3865640	to work on open VTubers to work POV.
3867080	3869320	Honestly, that's terrible, but it's kind of true.
3875320	3876120	How are you doing?
3876120	3877160	Don't miss my last.
3877160	3879320	I knew you were on Pokemans.
3880760	3881240	Whoa.
3881240	3881480	What?
3882440	3883000	I can't.
3883000	3884520	It won't let me swap to be.
3884520	3884840	Okay.
3884840	3885240	Now go.
3887560	3888200	Oh, there we go.
3888200	3888840	Bingo highway.
3893400	3895000	Not those kind of chips.
3895000	3895400	Silly.
3896120	3896760	Oh, okay.
3897320	3900440	Oh, I guess I didn't want to get that.
3900440	3901000	What?
3901000	3902600	That like completely bugged out.
3904840	3905480	Bingo.
3912200	3914280	Oh, that wasn't paying attention.
3914280	3914600	Hold on.
3914600	3915480	I was supposed to.
3915480	3915720	All right.
3915720	3916200	There we go.
3916200	3916520	Sorry.
3916520	3917720	I'm supposed to hit.
3917720	3920120	There's a bit of a strange delay going on.
3921640	3922680	Is there a chip up here?
3923640	3924760	I mean, it must be down here.
3924760	3925080	Hold on.
3925080	3927320	Let me get my team back since they all despawned.
3929640	3934520	Uh, I'll just use my own pure laziness.
3935800	3938680	Now not only the other mods can ban me, but VTubers as well.
3938680	3939480	Exactly.
3941720	3943000	The DH Charmy.
3943000	3945240	In the original game, he's married with kids.
3945960	3947320	The little bumblebee.
3947960	3949400	Who's he pollinating?
3951800	3953160	Married with kids?
3953160	3956520	Well, I had a divorce in the retcon of the lore.
3956520	3957320	Like, what?
3959800	3960520	Oh, I see it.
3961720	3963400	I want the chip, please.
3964520	3965320	4 out of 10.
3969000	3970680	What happens if I pollinate, huh?
3970760	3971640	What are you going to do?
3971640	3972280	Nothing's happening.
3972280	3973480	I won't let me go in.
3973480	3974200	Go in, please.
3974840	3975160	Yay!
3977480	3978200	He was so very...
3978200	3979480	What's playing Pokemon got very sad
3979480	3983720	because there was one I really wanted to catch trying to cast.
3983720	3984840	He stopped that.
3984840	3985320	Oh, gosh.
3986120	3987080	Oh, I was so lucky.
3987080	3987480	Hold on.
3989480	3991480	He's pollinating every queen out there.
3991480	3992280	He's like that.
3992280	3993960	Pollinating every sunflower, you can find.
3994760	3996200	Conquer is bad for a day's style.
3997080	3997400	Wow.
3999000	3999560	You're okay.
3999560	4001000	5 out of 10 for Chiep.
4003080	4003560	I think.
4006920	4009640	Ms. Margell has an ASMR stream coming up
4009640	4010920	if I'm not mistaken.
4011640	4013800	If I've not been taking a cheeky peek at you,
4013800	4014440	I think you do.
4016280	4017480	Enemy's up at home.
4018120	4018680	Whoa.
4018680	4019560	Can I get?
4019560	4020280	Yeah, I need him.
4021240	4021720	Yeah, I need...
4022520	4023080	Are we out?
4023800	4025640	We did not just out of bounds.
4025640	4025880	No!
4027800	4028280	Hold on.
4029560	4030200	Okay.
4030200	4030760	I think we...
4030760	4031960	Okay, we can get back in.
4031960	4034360	I have never done that in my life before.
4035400	4036120	Okay, let's go.
4037640	4038280	I didn't...
4038280	4039160	I haven't...
4039160	4039880	Oh, whoa.
4041880	4042520	Hold on.
4042520	4043240	I think...
4043240	4045320	I think maybe...
4045320	4046040	Yeah.
4046040	4047720	Yeah, I was going to say that's a little bit too sad.
4048600	4049320	Ultimate time.
4051000	4052520	Yeah, fun fact about that, ASMR.
4053160	4054200	When it happens,
4054200	4056360	I'm banning everyone on YouTube except you!
4058200	4058840	This is the way...
4059560	4060600	How dare you?
4061560	4063720	You wouldn't ban my reeflings, would you, though?
4064360	4065240	Come on, we're just here.
4065240	4065880	Oh!
4065880	4066520	I missed!
4066520	4067240	I missed!
4067240	4068600	Oh, I didn't realize...
4068600	4069480	How is that supposed to know
4069480	4071640	I was going to be chilling there?
4071640	4072200	Seriously.
4073400	4074920	Oh, my God, I'm going so fast.
4074920	4076360	Please, I just want this.
4076360	4076680	Okay.
4078440	4079880	Okay, do not fall off the mat.
4080680	4081080	Oh, no!
4081080	4082520	There was one back there!
4082520	4083080	How...
4083080	4083320	How...
4084360	4086040	How am I supposed to see him?
4087480	4088440	How many do I need?
4088440	4089320	I need two more.
4089640	4090680	And I've passed two.
4090680	4092120	Oh, but one more!
4092120	4093000	One more, one more!
4094840	4096120	Okay, we've got a bingo though, poggers.
4097800	4098920	There are more than 10 chips.
4098920	4100200	Okay, thank goodness, because...
4102440	4103800	I can see the rest of the map there.
4104440	4108280	I'm glad I will see good map design and stuff.
4108280	4110200	Like, if you're going to make me aim for like...
4110200	4111400	I can see a chip up there.
4111400	4111880	Can I get it?
4111880	4112680	Oh, no.
4112680	4114280	I cannot because I've fallen...
4114280	4114680	There, right.
4114680	4115160	Oh!
4115160	4115960	Ta-da!
4115960	4116440	We did it!
4117400	4119960	I like how friendly they have been in this game.
4119960	4122280	They could have made this so difficult if they wanted to.
4122280	4124920	And yet, they've like put extra stuff then, so...
4124920	4127240	Thank you, development team, for many a year ago.
4127240	4128520	You did fantastic.
4128520	4131240	And I think you should give yourself a pat on the back
4131240	4133720	because you have made the game not frustrating
4133720	4135160	by doing these kinds of things.
4135160	4135560	Thank you.
4137400	4139480	We're just a couple of little guys.
4139480	4142360	Stroney, you're such a good gamer that you're breaking the game, honestly.
4143400	4144200	I'm a little bit...
4144200	4145960	No clip to game by accident.
4146440	4147160	Awesome!
4147160	4149000	Totally awesome!
4149000	4149880	Awesome!
4149880	4151960	Totally awesome!
4151960	4154200	I fucking love charm...
4154200	4154680	Charm.
4164360	4164840	A fight?
4167960	4170520	I can't remember how many levels there are
4170520	4172440	or if it's the same for everyone, but...
4173800	4175400	I think it's like Haunted Mansion.
4176440	4177160	And then...
4178440	4179240	An airship?
4180840	4181240	Wow!
4186200	4186920	Can I get...
4186920	4188840	Okay, we've got one level up on Espeon.
4193160	4193720	Oh, there's...
4193720	4194200	Give me that!
4194200	4195400	No, go to him.
4195400	4195720	Yes.
4197480	4199320	No, do not spawn in the enemies!
4199960	4201000	No, go for him!
4201000	4201720	Okay, there we go.
4202600	4204760	He's leveled up to two, surely.
4205720	4206280	Surely.
4209000	4210280	Stop bouncing on that.
4210280	4212280	Wait, I saw those air birds though.
4213400	4216280	14 for Dark, which is the one with all levels.
4216280	4216520	Okay.
4217960	4219640	She's gonna become a bee.
4219640	4220680	Bee, bee, bee.
4220680	4221800	Charming bees.
4222520	4223800	I just loved it.
4223800	4225080	I just think he's cute.
4225720	4226680	And neat, okay.
4228920	4230360	Oh wow, wait, we don't have...
4230600	4236040	I guess we need level three in order to get these guys in one shot.
4239080	4240680	I'm just sending them to go do it.
4241320	4243000	Sorry, I'm sorry, okay.
4244280	4246280	It's the real cannon level, the forest level,
4246280	4247640	and then Haunted and then airship.
4247640	4248840	And then we're done already!
4250920	4251400	We're out.
4253000	4253640	We're out.
4253640	4254280	No, bitch.
4258360	4259160	Not, bitch.
4260120	4262840	Stop bouncing on this freaking jump pad.
4262840	4263800	I can hear it.
4264680	4266840	You're getting distracted, teammates.
4268200	4268680	I just...
4270840	4272040	No, go attack.
4273480	4274680	Oh, there's one more.
4274680	4275640	Okay, we got it, we got it.
4279240	4280760	The silver ones are armored.
4280760	4283240	Only power and falling does damage them.
4286120	4288680	I do admit I love the safety of the flying.
4288680	4292360	I'm sorry, cream carried last time and our tails did.
4300920	4302760	Oh, that's an ultimate if I've ever seen one.
4308200	4309960	Oh, they do get tons of money.
4315240	4316440	I like it, I'm here for it.
4319640	4321720	I got more money for those kills?
4322760	4324600	Wait, we already have Team Blast again.
4325960	4328520	Okay, let's just ultimate since there's a turtle, guys.
4328520	4329000	Hold on.
4335560	4338600	You need to replay the bridge mission on Microsoft to balance this game.
4338600	4341560	So, my dad was, as I said yesterday,
4341560	4343000	but my dad was legit laughing at me.
4343000	4348280	I'm like, bro, I'm beating him up.
4349160	4350520	Okay, that's an ultimate again.
4350520	4351320	We're on...
4351320	4353720	Wait, can we just keep repeating the alls if we get coins?
4357880	4358360	Hello?
4360360	4362520	Can we just keep going like this?
4365320	4367000	Those were easy ones.
4367960	4371400	Okay, I'm learning the strats about Team Chaotic.
4371400	4372280	I'm here for it.
4373400	4374280	Money farming.
4375640	4378440	You can chain them together as Chaotic if you defeat enough.
4379560	4380360	Wow.
4383320	4385560	Wow, there were a lot of them.
4386760	4387240	I'm here.
4388200	4389000	I'm getting it.
4389000	4389720	Real Canyon!
4393240	4394680	Oh, it's our mission objective.
4402360	4402840	Ooh.
4402840	4408520	I like when you hold eggs, they all look backwards.
4408520	4409400	It's so cute.
4412920	4414520	I wasn't paying attention to the mission,
4414520	4415560	so we're just going for it.
4415560	4415960	Let's go.
4417320	4419160	I assume need for speed.
4419160	4421080	Get up to 200 miles per hour,
4421080	4421720	and then the game...
4422520	4423480	That's the mission done.
4425480	4426120	Let's go.
4433480	4434120	I'm not just...
4434920	4436120	Why am I going so slow?
4436120	4437240	Am I going crazy?
4437240	4438760	I feel like I'm going really slow.
4440840	4442440	I even want to press X.
4442440	4444120	Am I supposed to tap it rapidly?
4445160	4445880	I'm tapping.
4445880	4446520	I'm tapping.
4447880	4449880	I needed to be the bumblebee.
4450520	4451880	Right, I'm being the bumblebee,
4451880	4452840	but I know what to do.
4454280	4457080	If you turn into the lane that goes faster...
4461080	4461580	Ooh.
4462840	4464840	Oh, I don't like that.
4464840	4466840	Oh, my God, that makes my...
4468840	4474840	I've not been funny, but that falling makes my clean shot,
4474840	4478840	because I literally can see the fall distance.
4482840	4484840	I'm going, I'm going, and...
4488840	4490840	I am so slow.
4490840	4492840	I don't think I'm supposed to be doing it this way,
4492840	4494840	but I'll just send it.
4496840	4498840	I'm going, I'm going.
4502840	4504840	Okay, we did it.
4504840	4506840	Level up bumblebee.
4510840	4512840	He certainly looks like it to me.
4512840	4514840	I don't know about you, but...
4514840	4516840	Do not pick up that key.
4516840	4518840	Do I make myself clear?
4518840	4520840	Yes.
4520840	4522840	Nope, not that. This one.
4526840	4528840	Taking Strony on a roller coaster ride.
4528840	4530840	I'm scared of roller coasters.
4530840	4532840	I don't even know how you guys do it.
4534840	4536840	People are like, oh, I'm so glad I got to go on the upside down curvy.
4536840	4540840	Why is the camera locking like this?
4540840	4542840	Fly, okay. That is why.
4544840	4546840	The camera said I've had enough of your shenanigans.
4548840	4550840	No, no, no.
4550840	4552840	Camera, please work with me.
4552840	4554840	I'm begging.
4554840	4556840	Okay, there we go.
4556840	4558840	We're doing it.
4558840	4560840	And maybe a really awkward way to do it,
4560840	4562840	but we're very slowly doing it.
4562840	4564840	Okay, look.
4564840	4566840	The rabbit or the hare?
4566840	4568840	Wait, no, that's not it.
4568840	4570840	The turtle or the rabbit?
4570840	4572840	Oh, this sounds so badly.
4572840	4574840	So badly.
4578840	4580840	They must.
4580840	4582840	And this is why we're the fricking
4584840	4586840	Bumble Beach.
4588840	4590840	Oh my gosh.
4590840	4592840	I'm not well enough to be having heart attacks like this.
4592840	4594840	Come on, let's send me, please.
4598840	4600840	What's this?
4600840	4602840	Push me back. Don't do that.
4604840	4606840	I guess we fly over.
4606840	4608840	Wait, we can't fly over.
4608840	4610840	No.
4610840	4612840	Put me back.
4614840	4616840	Why even?
4616840	4618840	Why? Why even?
4620840	4624840	Why even place such a thing there?
4626840	4628840	What even is that?
4628840	4630840	So only the middle one sends you back.
4630840	4632840	And if you're dumb enough to pick the outer ones,
4632840	4634840	then that's on you.
4634840	4636840	Please, camera angle.
4636840	4638840	I am begging you.
4640840	4642840	Sweet little bumblebee.
4642840	4644840	I mean, he did try and save us,
4644840	4646840	but we didn't do it.
4646840	4648840	Hard clench.
4648840	4650840	Rail canyon is such a buggy level.
4650840	4652840	The only time I die in this game
4652840	4654840	is legit due to,
4654840	4656840	like, the camera not being nice
4656840	4658840	or
4658840	4660840	the mapping going funny.
4660840	4662840	Like, it shouldn't do that.
4668840	4670840	Again?
4670840	4672840	Okay. I'm not to be the bumblebee,
4672840	4674840	I don't think, when I'm on these,
4674840	4676840	but he's the safest.
4676840	4678840	He's literally the safest thing in the game.
4678840	4680840	Because you can pick yourself up
4680840	4682840	when you drop fall off.
4682840	4684840	Right.
4684840	4686840	And then the other rails.
4686840	4688840	Right.
4688840	4690840	Now destroy that.
4690840	4692840	Right.
4692840	4694840	Oh, there's something in here.
4694840	4696840	Oh.
4696840	4698840	Okay. I thought it was going to, like,
4698840	4700840	a switch or something.
4700840	4702840	The rails are so scary.
4706840	4708840	Okay.
4708840	4710840	And now I'm too low level to do anything
4710840	4712840	from a distance again.
4712840	4714840	No. Bumblebee.
4714840	4716840	Okay.
4716840	4718840	And then press the button.
4718840	4720840	And then I guess, jump aboard.
4720840	4722840	Are you squid me right now?
4724840	4726840	Something I think we've learned
4726840	4728840	is that all we need to do is drive
4728840	4730840	strongly around at high enough speed
4730840	4732840	and that instantly makes her woozy enough
4732840	4734840	to be in subspace.
4734840	4736840	I'm so confident on her bike,
4736840	4738840	but not in the car.
4738840	4740840	Why would you want me to be a nosy
4740840	4742840	then? That's so mean.
4742840	4744840	I was so ill because of that taxi.
4744840	4746840	Thank you tiny spin.
4746840	4748840	But I was so ill.
4748840	4750840	Why would you want me to be a nosy?
4750840	4752840	I had to, it literally was so bad
4752840	4754840	it didn't go away after, like, a sleep.
4754840	4756840	Oh, there was a bomb.
4756840	4758840	I'm sorry. I see it now.
4758840	4760840	I see my ignorant ways.
4762840	4764840	I'm just going to play it safe.
4764840	4766840	Drive her around.
4766840	4768840	Just pick her up and spin her.
4768840	4770840	Get the siph.
4770840	4772840	Is it the siphon-trypical force?
4776840	4778840	Yes, this looks correct.
4782840	4784840	Stay on one of the buttons.
4784840	4786840	I'm being trolled.
4786840	4788840	I'm actually refusing.
4790840	4792840	Just carry her. 10 hour car, right?
4792840	4794840	I wouldn't even make an hour.
4794840	4796840	I am so terribly
4796840	4798840	bad.
4798840	4800840	The siphon-trypical...
4800840	4802840	I can't even remember the fricking word.
4802840	4804840	It's like siphon-trypical force.
4804840	4806840	Oh, and a level up.
4806840	4808840	Oh, we can finally destroy.
4808840	4810840	Please do not perish me and begging.
4810840	4812840	Against my greater judgment
4812840	4814840	I will go
4814840	4816840	we espion-vespion
4816840	4818840	because
4820840	4822840	I think they've only made it
4822840	4824840	with these height
4824840	4826840	hitboxes in mind and that's why
4826840	4828840	I keep getting perished.
4830840	4832840	I really don't want to lose.
4832840	4834840	I run now.
4834840	4836840	I'm moving, I'm moving.
4836840	4838840	I promise.
4838840	4840840	I'm going, I'm going.
4840840	4842840	The sound effects are actually
4842840	4844840	bugging out a little bit.
4844840	4846840	Wee!
4846840	4848840	Any movie shows
4848840	4850840	watch along the streams
4850840	4852840	coming up
4852840	4854840	not until two weeks
4854840	4856840	away.
4856840	4858840	When
4858840	4860840	Meeda goes home
4860840	4862840	I am going
4862840	4864840	to do a ton of back to back
4864840	4866840	to back to back streams, okay?
4866840	4868840	To make up for all the missed membership streams
4868840	4870840	like I'm talking like daily membership streams
4870840	4872840	I'm like public streaming
4872840	4874840	to make up
4874840	4876840	for all the streamies that I miss.
4878840	4880840	But for the next
4880840	4882840	two weeks, no, there's no ASMR
4882840	4884840	and there's no
4884840	4886840	did I just miss?
4890840	4892840	Okay, I think I'm supposed
4892840	4894840	to go this way. Hold on.
4894840	4896840	Okay, that looks right. Yeah, that looks right.
4896840	4898840	Now that you mentioned
4898840	4900840	Siphonchic Focal Force, did you know
4900840	4902840	that you can use it to scramble eggs
4902840	4904840	without breaking the shell?
4904840	4906840	That's cool, I like that.
4906840	4908840	I like
4908840	4910840	there is, hold on, what's in here?
4910840	4912840	Money!
4912840	4914840	Well, I don't need it, but thank you.
4914840	4916840	Someone else might need it. I'll take this one though
4916840	4918840	because it's okay, I won't take this one.
4918840	4920840	Are you squiddling here or what?
4920840	4922840	Freakin' in a...
4922840	4924840	Having your head spin from car rides
4924840	4926840	gives a wonderful excuse to plan in X-Tress
4926840	4928840	stops on a road trip to make your head
4928840	4930840	spin in other ways.
4930840	4932840	Eh?
4932840	4934840	Tim Shull, what did you say?
4934840	4936840	Having your head spin from car rides
4936840	4938840	gives a wonderful excuse to
4938840	4940840	plan in X-Tress
4940840	4942840	stops on a road trip
4942840	4944840	to make your head spin in other ways.
4944840	4946840	Is this
4946840	4948840	refling asking for head?
4948840	4950840	Yes or no?
4950840	4952840	Be honest, what did you just ask for?
4954840	4956840	I'm too, I am
4956840	4958840	so sorry, I'm so sleep deprived
4958840	4960840	right now. I am fighting
4960840	4962840	for my life trying to speak English to you.
4962840	4964840	I
4964840	4966840	am fighting for my life.
4966840	4968840	Okay, let's go
4968840	4970840	him again.
4970840	4972840	I was supposed to go up?
4972840	4974840	Why
4974840	4976840	jump?
4976840	4978840	Don't make me jump.
4980840	4982840	Wait, did I just do a circle?
4982840	4984840	I think I may have just done a
4984840	4986840	circle?
4986840	4988840	No.
4988840	4990840	Oh, actually I've
4990840	4992840	miraculously appeared where I need to be
4992840	4994840	at the right moment.
4994840	4996840	And now go for it!
4996840	4998840	Wait, there's something
4998840	5000840	in the middle there.
5000840	5002840	Shawnee doesn't even speak English
5002840	5004840	honestly.
5008840	5010840	Oh shit, hold on.
5010840	5012840	Stop, camera please.
5012840	5014840	Wait, that wasn't even a
5016840	5018840	This is just for monies?
5018840	5020840	Oh no, it's not.
5020840	5022840	Wait, I've done it, no.
5022840	5024840	Okay.
5024840	5026840	Assume
5026840	5028840	this?
5030840	5032840	Okay, it worked.
5032840	5034840	It worked.
5034840	5036840	We're doing it, we're progressing.
5036840	5038840	Hi.
5038840	5040840	Thanks for joining me.
5040840	5042840	I don't know when I think Shibi is.
5048840	5050840	What?
5054840	5056840	Was I supposed to do
5056840	5058840	something there?
5058840	5060840	Shibi and Azura are collabing here, it's
5060840	5062840	Audra.
5062840	5064840	I don't think I'll be able to redirect, I don't
5064840	5066840	know. Maybe.
5066840	5068840	What is happening?
5068840	5070840	This is making my head
5070840	5072840	stand.
5074840	5076840	I'm trying, I promise, I'm trying my
5076840	5078840	best.
5078840	5080840	Oh, we did it!
5082840	5084840	I didn't expect that.
5084840	5086840	Another endurance stream.
5088840	5090840	I don't even know if I'm going to last two
5090840	5092840	hours, I'm going to be honest.
5092840	5094840	I'm not kidding when I said I haven't
5094840	5096840	slept.
5096840	5098840	So I did Isaac with you
5098840	5100840	and then
5100840	5102840	I went out with my dad
5102840	5104840	and I did all this stuff and we
5104840	5106840	found my mom,
5106840	5108840	found my granddad.
5108840	5110840	I got a two hour nap
5110840	5112840	after the cafe.
5112840	5114840	I woke up
5114840	5116840	and I was like, I don't need to stay because I'm
5116840	5118840	full.
5118840	5120840	And then I've been up freaking
5120840	5122840	working doing all this behind the scenes stuff
5122840	5124840	and I still didn't
5124840	5126840	raise Shibi's script, which I need to write.
5126840	5128840	It's just
5128840	5130840	a simple ear cleaning script
5130840	5132840	that I forgot.
5132840	5134840	I'm to
5134840	5136840	okay, I'm to destroy these
5136840	5138840	little egg capsule design
5138840	5140840	things.
5140840	5142840	If you don't feel well, take a break. No, no, no,
5142840	5144840	I know, I know.
5144840	5146840	I think maybe we could probably
5146840	5148840	do a Sonic Heroes marathon
5148840	5150840	though. I wouldn't mind trying
5150840	5152840	100% this game.
5152840	5154840	In terms of doing all the
5154840	5156840	gang stuff.
5156840	5158840	I don't know about collecting all
5158840	5160840	the emeralds, that's something
5160840	5162840	even I'm not sure I've got
5162840	5164840	what does this do?
5164840	5166840	Nope, nope.
5170840	5172840	Have you considered
5172840	5174840	a sector or other sports stuff?
5174840	5176840	It's just
5182840	5184840	I don't know
5184840	5186840	how I had the brain power to even do anything
5186840	5188840	about that.
5188840	5190840	It's just things need to calm down.
5190840	5192840	That's it, there's so much going on
5192840	5194840	but things aren't calming down just
5194840	5196840	quite yet. That's what I'm waiting on.
5196840	5198840	But essentially
5198840	5200840	I'm about to have no
5200840	5202840	major
5202840	5204840	role
5204840	5206840	at all. I'll just be full
5206840	5208840	strummer.
5208840	5210840	Please actually
5210840	5212840	perish this so he doesn't get caught.
5212840	5214840	Okay, there we go.
5214840	5216840	Oh gosh,
5216840	5218840	I don't know if I'm going to get all these.
5218840	5220840	I hope to police tons around the map.
5220840	5222840	But yeah, sorry
5222840	5224840	I'm really not able to articulate
5224840	5226840	quite well at the moment.
5226840	5228840	Do you apologise?
5228840	5230840	Turns out if you didn't get enough sleep
5230840	5232840	it affects your ability to communicate.
5238840	5240840	Weflin love, thank you.
5240840	5242840	I think
5242840	5244840	I might call it at the two of remark.
5244840	5246840	I'm trying my hardest
5246840	5248840	to even speak. I is so
5248840	5250840	hard right now.
5250840	5252840	But thank you for understanding. Thank you for the tip as well.
5252840	5254840	She
5254840	5256840	No, she
5256840	5258840	apparently doesn't know that
5258840	5260840	she's not supposed to stream every single day.
5260840	5262840	No, I think I like
5262840	5264840	it. I like the consistency. I like
5264840	5266840	the idea of you being like
5266840	5268840	you know, like oh
5268840	5270840	you know
5270840	5272840	I fucking come on
5272840	5274840	a sentence
5274840	5276840	please. Oh the consistency is nice
5276840	5278840	because like oh
5278840	5280840	it's this time, Strong's was going to be on.
5280840	5282840	I like that. I like the familiarity
5282840	5284840	being like oh you know what
5284840	5286840	I'm bored or I want to listen to something
5286840	5288840	in the background while I work.
5288840	5290840	Strong's was online, right? I'll have a
5290840	5292840	we listen in type thing. I like that.
5292840	5294840	There's like 6
5294840	5296840	or 80 on the map. Oh thank goodness.
5296840	5298840	If there's that many on the map
5298840	5300840	I'm not stressed. Right. We'll level up.
5300840	5302840	That's what I want to see.
5302840	5304840	Sleep fun. No, no.
5304840	5306840	Don't give me my money.
5306840	5308840	I'll go off it too. How about that?
5308840	5310840	Thank you Doomsday Dan
5310840	5312840	for the tip. I'll
5312840	5314840	go off it too. How about that?
5314840	5316840	2 hour mark. I feel like 2 hours is fair.
5316840	5318840	And then
5318840	5320840	we'll do a Sonic Heroes
5320840	5322840	Marathon
5322840	5324840	and we'll finish it.
5324840	5326840	Don't think I didn't spot this one.
5326840	5328840	I might be delirious
5328840	5330840	but I spotted that a mile off.
5330840	5332840	It's nice
5332840	5334840	being here with you every day. Well it's nice having
5334840	5336840	you every day. I'm very lucky
5336840	5338840	that
5338840	5340840	you know even
5340840	5342840	you know even though I'm a bit
5342840	5344840	special I'm a bit different. You know what I'm saying?
5344840	5346840	Can I go in please?
5346840	5348840	Okay there we go.
5348840	5350840	Strong's standard time
5350840	5352840	honestly.
5352840	5354840	That's nice.
5354840	5356840	I don't feel
5356840	5358840	pressure streaming.
5358840	5360840	Oh I need to do this.
5360840	5362840	Oh I messed up.
5362840	5364840	I don't know. It's just such
5364840	5366840	chill and pleasant
5366840	5368840	time.
5368840	5370840	I do speak on it often but I don't
5370840	5372840	feel
5372840	5374840	streaming daily is taking too much
5374840	5376840	out of me. What it is
5376840	5378840	is that
5378840	5380840	things haven't calmed down
5380840	5382840	because
5382840	5384840	a new thing pops up and I'm like
5384840	5386840	oh crap that's right.
5386840	5388840	I
5388840	5390840	said it a wee bit but
5390840	5392840	the girls got a little
5392840	5394840	sidetracked
5394840	5396840	and the audios weren't really recorded
5396840	5398840	in time for the editors to pick it up
5398840	5400840	so then I had to kind of pick up a bit of it.
5400840	5402840	Oh I see it.
5402840	5404840	I see it.
5404840	5406840	I was up editing
5406840	5408840	my stuff and I've got zero stuff to do
5408840	5410840	and
5410840	5412840	the girls have over Emi, Mersi, Shibi
5412840	5414840	and Asi should all have at least one audio
5414840	5416840	up for this month but it's kind of
5416840	5418840	those things where like I kind of really
5418840	5420840	planned for it. The girls were having fun.
5420840	5422840	Of course they got distracted. They're only human.
5422840	5424840	I'm not going to be a weirdo and be mad at them
5424840	5426840	or whatever like the fuck.
5426840	5428840	Oh!
5430840	5432840	Can I destroy it?
5432840	5434840	No I can. Okay just be nice
5434840	5436840	and careful.
5436840	5438840	And then it's like yeah I had
5438840	5440840	this stream plan come on
5440840	5442840	and why am I flying?
5442840	5444840	This is a fan!
5444840	5446840	Oh my god wait
5446840	5448840	the games
5448840	5450840	registering me is falling
5450840	5452840	no.
5454840	5456840	Yeah this is the only place
5456840	5458840	where I see it. I was here for a month
5458840	5460840	I was actually here for a month.
5460840	5462840	Feels good man. Sorry I just fell off the map there
5462840	5464840	and just about did it again.
5464840	5466840	Game?
5468840	5470840	Game doesn't like me.
5470840	5472840	I keep it.
5472840	5474840	I've never had so much issues playing Sonic Heroes
5474840	5476840	but Chaotic I think that's what
5476840	5478840	three instances now where it's been about
5478840	5480840	hmm.
5486840	5488840	And destroy it. That's 18.
5490840	5492840	And then we've got 19, 20
5492840	5494840	and 21 up ahead.
5498840	5500840	Okay I was
5500840	5502840	worried I wasn't going to reach that but I did.
5504840	5506840	21.
5506840	5508840	Put charming thing thank you to the donation.
5508840	5510840	Thank you.
5510840	5512840	I'll just get myself.
5514840	5516840	Oh what was the audio theme?
5516840	5518840	I might have been the writer for it.
5518840	5520840	I'm so sad when
5520840	5522840	August happens because
5522840	5524840	August means I didn't write
5524840	5526840	everything
5526840	5528840	so I can't get the credit for writing something good.
5532840	5534840	It was the weird girl one.
5534840	5536840	There was two weird girl ones
5536840	5538840	that month for her.
5538840	5540840	But thank you for the five bully legends.
5542840	5544840	Was it the one where the neighbour needs
5544840	5546840	a liquid
5546840	5548840	or was it
5548840	5550840	Oh I wasn't paying attention. Jump.
5552840	5554840	I can't
5554840	5556840	sue.
5556840	5558840	Hold on I need to actually
5558840	5560840	use aimbot because I've only got two lives.
5560840	5562840	What the heck is that?
5564840	5566840	I'm holding.
5566840	5568840	But yeah basically
5568840	5570840	once August starts
5570840	5572840	up like the August audio is coming out
5572840	5574840	I didn't
5574840	5576840	game.
5578840	5580840	Hey game you know how you were supposed to
5580840	5582840	propel me halfway across the map?
5582840	5584840	Did you forget
5584840	5586840	that detail or
5588840	5590840	I
5590840	5592840	have never perished so much in Sonic Heroes
5596840	5598840	I'm all the way back here
5598840	5600840	on the games test
5600840	5602840	and me.
5602840	5604840	It's literally test and medicals
5604840	5606840	I'm all the way back here
5606840	5608840	Game is asleep
5608840	5610840	deprived of strong so I don't know
5614840	5616840	I can
5616840	5618840	skip these ones.
5618840	5620840	Oh I'm gonna say it.
5620840	5622840	The game is not game in.
5622840	5624840	Todd wouldn't say
5624840	5626840	it just worked.
5626840	5628840	We do a little teasing
5628840	5630840	we do.
5636840	5638840	I still write all my
5638840	5640840	own stuff but that's because
5640840	5642840	I've lost them your honour.
5642840	5644840	I'm gonna stay on like this
5644840	5646840	I don't know why the beating would propel me forward.
5650840	5652840	This is freaking
5652840	5654840	adorable.
5654840	5656840	Oh yeah for marriage you need to kiss me right now
5658840	5660840	Thank you boy
5660840	5662840	for the tip.
5662840	5664840	And Brian for announcing
5664840	5666840	I appreciate Brian in these parts.
5666840	5668840	Maybe I can get the one that's up ahead
5668840	5670840	Whoa.
5670840	5672840	Yay!
5672840	5674840	Please do not throw me off the map this time
5674840	5676840	I'm begging
5676840	5678840	Don't throw me off the map
5678840	5680840	Boom
5680840	5682840	What's going on?
5682840	5684840	Why are you putting me on him?
5686840	5688840	It keeps putting me on the B
5688840	5690840	I entered that
5690840	5692840	as the crocodile and it keeps
5692840	5694840	putting me on the B
5696840	5698840	I think because I keep losing
5698840	5700840	Speedy Gonzalez
5704840	5706840	Honestly the game could throw me on any other day
5706840	5708840	I'm like please not this day
5708840	5710840	I've had no sleep over I think it's
5710840	5712840	I don't know how long
5712840	5714840	It must be over 30 hours at this point
5714840	5716840	I've been awake
5718840	5720840	Because a two hour nap unfortunately
5720840	5722840	is not enough to replenish the
5722840	5724840	the old juices the old brain waves
5724840	5726840	It took me actually I edited
5728840	5730840	a bonus
5730840	5732840	like a subscriber special audio
5732840	5734840	but
5734840	5736840	again I don't know if I can upload it
5736840	5738840	to YouTube right away until the warnings
5738840	5740840	await purely because
5744840	5746840	purely because because because
5746840	5748840	because
5748840	5750840	the audio
5750840	5752840	is me sitting on the mic
5752840	5754840	I'm like repeatedly sitting on the mic over and over
5758840	5760840	I cannot see
5760840	5762840	right okay this time he is fully
5762840	5764840	on me we have all
5764840	5766840	three of us together if this glitches out
5766840	5768840	one more time I'm gonna cry because it really
5768840	5770840	shouldn't
5770840	5772840	I'm not sure what to do
5772840	5774840	if it doesn't propel me forward I might
5774840	5776840	can't be a framerate issue
5776840	5778840	can he be
5780840	5782840	it's a speed thing as well
5782840	5784840	there there there oh we did it oh my god

5790840	5792840	place of my head

6538840	6540840	I didn't even notice that I like him
6540840	6542840	he's so annoying
6542840	6544840	even though hardcore sonic fans
6544840	6546840	tend to find him annoying

6679840	6681840	and putting me to sleep because I'm fucking dying
6681840	6683840	not to be dramatic or anything
