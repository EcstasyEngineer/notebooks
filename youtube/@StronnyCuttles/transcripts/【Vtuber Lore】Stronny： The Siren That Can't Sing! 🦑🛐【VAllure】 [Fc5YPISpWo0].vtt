Growing up in the open seas, there are stories told of the monsters that lurked below,

00:07.200 --> 00:15.440
deadly Leviathans, monstrous serpents, yet no giant could hope to match the lethal efficiency

00:15.440 --> 00:26.480
of one such creature, equal in elegance incarnate, so alluring yet so deadly, so hypnotically fatal

00:26.480 --> 00:36.400
as the siren, the succubi of the sea, the witch of the waves, the black widows of the, uh, black sea,

00:37.120 --> 00:43.680
a maiden with a hypnotic gaze that warped the wills of even the most salt-seasoned captains,

00:43.680 --> 00:47.920
and a song that commanded the crews of even the most loyal sailors.

00:48.560 --> 00:54.880
My mother would read me these tales before bed, tales of aquatic femme fatales that lured men to

00:54.880 --> 01:02.640
sail themselves to their blood-soaked watery graves. These horrific tales of nautical nefariousness

01:02.640 --> 01:12.080
would keep me up at night. They made me feel so, so inspired. I mean, my people used to do that?

01:12.080 --> 01:18.480
That's so cool. I mean, I've never fed on a human before, and the smartest thing I've ever hypnotized

01:18.480 --> 01:25.440
is a seal. But learning that my ancestors used to eat humans by the literal boatloads was amazing.

01:25.440 --> 01:31.360
I couldn't wait to grow up and eat my fill, fat ones, tall ones, skinny ones, even hairy ones.

01:32.240 --> 01:40.960
Though I learned our people aren't as feared by humans as they once were. My ocean, my home, humans

01:40.960 --> 01:48.080
to fail it with their presence. Worse still, they tossed their filth into it, further insulting us.

01:48.800 --> 01:54.640
How could this have happened? How were we brought so low from our past? They used to tell legends on

01:54.640 --> 02:00.160
every port that made even the most straight-laced superstition scoffing marines keep in the back

02:00.160 --> 02:05.360
of their minds. They would dedicate figureheads of their ships in respect to our beautiful yet

02:05.360 --> 02:12.560
delicate bodies. They put us on every map. But now? Ugh, disgusting humans.

02:13.760 --> 02:19.920
One night, I envisioned a genius plan, the first strike in my crusade against the human world.

02:22.080 --> 02:27.360
I would infiltrate in hijack a fishing vessel and use it as my own pirate vessel with a crew of

02:27.360 --> 02:34.080
hypnotized thralls. I was going to wage a once siren war against all of humanity. It was going to

02:34.080 --> 02:41.200
be perfect, and I definitely would have won. That was until I envisioned a plan that was even more

02:41.200 --> 02:49.360
perfect. Er, well, at least more time efficient. Making my way below deck, I made a strange discovery.

02:50.080 --> 02:58.240
The humans were hypnotized by their own choice. I couldn't believe it. I looked at boat after boat,

02:58.240 --> 03:05.920
these humans charmed like a siren's spell, even dedicating their lives to their chosen idols.

03:05.920 --> 03:14.400
These idols they fawn over were these sirens too. That's it. That's the secret to defeating the humans.

03:14.400 --> 03:19.840
I'm going to find the secret to their magic and harness this power myself and bring power back

03:19.840 --> 03:26.720
to my people. I must gather fame, fortune, scandals, anything and everything to grow my influence over

03:26.720 --> 03:32.800
mankind to bring sirens back into the minds of the people. But I'm not just going to tip the

03:32.800 --> 03:41.920
scales. I'm going for complete domination. Every human will bend to my will. All will be cheering

03:41.920 --> 03:47.920
for their own demise. I will be the instrument of karmic justice. The world will worship me and

03:47.920 --> 03:54.400
praise my name as I bring about their end. I will march every human under my control into the ocean,

03:54.400 --> 03:59.680
and my people will chant my name as they have a feeding frenzy that has written into legend.

04:03.520 --> 04:12.640
Though that's a very long-term goal. With every big venture, whether business-wise or lifestyle,

04:12.640 --> 04:30.880
every big undertaking starts small scale, right? Hmm. So, I think I'll start with you.
