1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
I'm not big enough. Hold on. Give me a boonie.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,440
Also me and my dad's wife.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,400
You know that?

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,240
But what should you know that meme that goes I for real think I just got a virus?

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,480
Me with his background music right now.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,400
Randomly has like the best background fucking version which is rather odd and unexpected.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,040
Which I didn't.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,720
Did not expect from Dungeonclawler.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,160
Wait hold on.

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,760
Just making sure.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,640
I like wrote my little notes on it and stuff like a little nerd.

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,720
I was like I want to talk about this game.

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,360
I'm on my high rate plan.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,840
Good morning. Good evening.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,640
Good afternoon.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,680
I for real think I just got a virus.

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,680
Can you hear the loading like menu in the background?

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,160
Randomly has like the coolest bdm randomly.

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,160
Also why are you gifting me memberships offline?

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,320

24
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,760

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,880
But thank you and I hope congrats to those who caught up with your play.

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:53,360
So this game is called so instead of what's called a dungeon crawler it's called it's a claw type

27
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,280
machine game lgf get the fuck on out of here with that profile picture.

28
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,080
Thank you for the 10 gifted memberships and congrats to those who caught up with your face.

29
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:15,280
So instead of a dungeon crawler game it's a claw machine game called dungeon clawler.

30
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,600
Was that even loud enough?

31
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,080
I can't actually hear the sound effect.

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,280
I don't know if that played.

33
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,600
Did you hear bdm please be honest.

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,960
Be honest did you hear bdm?

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,000
I never heard it.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,680
It's too loud.

37
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,960
Okay that makes sense.

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,600

00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:06,000

of it love you momo love you remember that time I got the thunder waffle stomper and black ops one

68
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,920
right I have two more notes so I actually wanted to do this thing where we gave like new games or

69
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,800
indie games a bit of a spotlight before anyone's like why are you like absolutely just slurping

70
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:46,000
off the knob of the same relax um I'm not being sponsored I ain't been nothing like that um I've

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,960
always wanted to do a bit like either an indie game thingy a smaller dev team or something of that

72
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,840
nature um reverse thank you for the extended membership love you all get the dub strongy as

73
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:09,920
always we get the w's in this house um yes I if I was if I was a young little seed a little developer

74
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:17,440
seeds you know all it takes is one person to get shine a little light on your game and you know

75
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:27,840
it's kind of like um it's just kind of like be you know do what you want for others what you

76
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,760
would want done to you so I saw someone play this game as I was falling asleep and I was like

77
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,040
Ken what it's in the demo it's coming out this quarter four this year so it's already on its way

78
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,720
and the demo's pretty wrapped up people have racked up 10 hours in the reviews and I'm like

79
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:52,640
oh I don't know if we're actually gonna do a run or not but um long story short Stray Fawn Studios

80
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:59,280
is both the developer and publisher and they have 24 games under their radar roughly I think they

81
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,760
have a few bundle packs that Steam might have counted as its own game like put published on its

82
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,400
own but that's not quite right they've dipped their finger into many pies but it seems that they

83
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,160
prefer strategy games and you could definitely confidently say they actually specialize in

84
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,240
strategy games um I don't care what you play I'm just happy to be here I'm just happy to be here

85
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:27,360
yeah so I'm gonna see if monthly we can try and do an indie spotlight or small studio spotlight

86
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,880
um and I'll kind of talk a little bit about teeny tiny bit about the game of the dev team and

87
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:39,760
then we'll just get into it and see what our impressions are um I personally personally

88
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,040
actually really interested see how the game developers like do do because the gameplay

89
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:53,840
of it looks really fun and user friendly you know me if the game looks like I don't have to

90
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:01,360
think much to play it oh I'm all over it like a damn rash um fake gamer by the way uh so we'll

91
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,080
do a run we're gonna see how it goes I think the only feedback that I saw was that they might not

92
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,200
have sound effects that like give off the reward system when you when you you know to hit your

93
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,440
dopamine receptors when you pick up stuff but we'll see I don't know maybe they won't do that since

94
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:28,640
that but um yeah we'll go for it so it's like a cute kind of you know I'm gonna say controversial

95
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,840
the art style actually reminds me of Mugenics which is what

96
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:44,080
um Ed McMillan is doing the creator of Isaac right now binding on but the head video game

97
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:53,360
binding on Isaac yes um he is doing a game called Mugenics and it has this kind of art style um

98
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,600
it's not right on the thing but anyway so choose your character sir bunalot sir bunalot

99
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,360
used to be a knight but he gambled away all of his coins and he fell from grace there's a space

100
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,680
between coins and oh games unplayable sorry devs I need to give you that feedback right now games

101
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,920
unplayable he is now on a quest to reclaim his lucky paw which was chopped off by the evil dungeon

102
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,960
lord okay so we have a quest to get back what was once ours

103
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:36,160
so our deck if we pick up a sword attacks an ear's enemy for five damage blocks damage by five blocks

104
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:44,880
by ten double the amount of block when picked up alone does 10 damage or 20 if picked up alone

105
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:52,400
which is rather things well just default because I've never played it there's no point how to play

106
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:01,280
collect items using your qualified enemies however your mouse cursor over wait oh however no however

107
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,480
your mouse cuss shit wait hold on let me drink this let me take a slurp of a tea do you really

108
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:15,360
like strategy games um I like games that look easy like I think that's why I don't mind a good

109
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,040
routine make sure you because it's like just shoot your way out of the problem

110
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,320
just throw a few grenades here and there's like I will get over here it's fine

111
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,200
would you like recommendations for other indie games I absolutely would love recommendations

112
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,640
for indie games I as I said I would like to maybe monthly we take a look at an indie game

113
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,240
like we purposefully take a look at an indie game and we become game journalists and forget how to

114
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:54,480
double jump um for the day just for the for the the heck of it for the tea and right use

115
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:04,640
WASD to move on the map use the A and D to move the claw space to drop the claw space to close the claw

116
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,880
back space to skip your turn when would it be advantageous to skip a turn you can change the

117
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:20,240
game speed and settings got it right so it was a bit slow right w got it right okay so

118
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,480
so as we see okay I don't want to be too big for this hold on maybe I should be like

119
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,040
skinny tall you know I'm saying skinny tall right so this is our juicy claw that's controlled by

120
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,840
my WASD this is all our deck but we'll see our deck um 100 percent of the time um it's always

121
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:48,160
exposed to us the deck is always exposed yeah yes it is three points um so there's little

122
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:55,280
squidgy slimes and we attack the baddies down here we can see their health bars 27 27 we're 110

123
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:03,760
with the uh five block buffer I guess your health has increased by 10 start each turn with a block so

124
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:12,000
we know these swords do 10 so if we could get three swords in a go we'd be able to whack out this

125
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,280
little slime but yeah and the slime also gives your heads up that you're going to be walloped for

126
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:29,600
nine but uh that's it oh shoot and then there you go that that's that's the gameplay there's a oh wait

127
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:37,440
am I an idiot I did another 10 oh it's five the long sword is the other one right okay well we're

128
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:44,160
picked up a lot of me sword we picked up a lot of blocks so I think that's actually not that bad but

129
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:52,800
as I said one of the feedbacks was there's no like which which went fatang but I think that's just

130
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:59,120
because it's obviously a demo this isn't a finished although I would argue from the looks of it on

131
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:07,920
the surface it is rather finished um uh we just came the I don't want to accidentally hit the claw

132
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,960
over here you guys can see my cursor right right and but yeah it's like a turn base oh that was all

133
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:23,520
defense that's rubbish well he's not gonna hurt us that's good news and as the pray polish them

134
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,720
honestly they could easily have just been like no I don't want to right please get the sword or I'll

135
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:37,360
cry okay there we go is that enough to get on no but yeah that's it that's literally I just saw it

136
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,480
it looked simple um and I saw it was like new on the come up if you want to argue it's on the come

137
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:53,360
up and they're definitely gonna add a specific but yeah meet us as in from the video game binding

138
00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:01,920
of Isaac converts all fluff inside a small rate no increase your block by three and gives you five

139
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:09,840
spikes so if something hits me it'll get hurt so every time we finish our rounds successfully

140
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:15,360
I just said floor one of five on this one um attacking the nearest enemy deals three damage

141
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:24,720
plus one damage for each 10 gold coins you have what the heck we're deck building like balutrol

142
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:34,000
I mean that's my best game uh I don't even have that much money right now though so I don't even

143
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,440
think we're gonna get much benefit from that that was actually really good though oh you can move it

144
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:47,680
whilst I'm there he's doing the attack stuff I did not realize that um go that meet us touch

145
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:56,960
literally from the video game binding of Isaac I think it's always better to just go for the juicier

146
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:04,160
sword because it literally does 10 which is equivically I'll maybe get these three oh no it

147
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:14,800
still wouldn't be enough actually to get it but yeah this is giving slay the spire vibes wait am I

148
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:24,080
gonna enjoy slay the spire because of this but yes as I said this game comes out in this this year

149
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:30,240
and we're in the q4 they said but um literally just build your own deck and let it go you can

150
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,160
re-roll with mooney but I guess because we picked a money one then best keep it max what is this

151
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:45,360
you have statistics oh my lord okay brass knuckle attacks the first enemy for two and gives you one

152
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,280
dodge interesting the mama are attacking the nearest enemy what by shoving it up his arse

153
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:57,920
dealing 0.5 damage for missing health you have deals three damage to yourself no wait these are

154
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:06,240
terrible re-roll that don't give me that get one block every time you use an item I mean this is

155
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:14,960
highlighted so it makes me think I'm supposed to get it I'm just gonna get it and it it was highlighted

156
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:21,440
okay there but yeah there's like more gambas section so as you like go through the map if you will

157
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:28,560
you can like roll stuff question mark I'm not really sure what this part is I didn't understand it

158
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:36,400
much when I was watching the reviews but uh yeah what's this you remove three poison at the end of

159
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:45,360
each turn or you heal five after each fight that's really small whereas poison I think vaccine

160
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,960
there is like poison elements I don't I can't remember what the other elements are

161
00:16:50,960 --> 00:17:00,480
so we're grabbing the gauntlet and I run a little but sometimes the games mean and I'll do that I'll

162
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:08,720
like shove you off of something that should have been yours I didn't get one I got one golden sword

163
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:17,760
one of the resource but I do have 20 oh they're just poking up okay so enemies can increase their

164
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,920
defense and stuff like that why did you ping the knife halfway across the map don't be so rude

165
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:36,960
I just think it's neat I think the dev team's done a good job of this in my in my humble opinion

166
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,960
you know I think the dev team's done a good job uh I'll be very interested to see how they would

167
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:50,720
develop it further because because of the gameplay I have seen and like the gameplay we're doing now

168
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,200
you know we're being introduced to new enemies we're being introduced to new items into the deck

169
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,560
the only way that I can see expansion is just like updates in terms of new items and new stuff and

170
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:12,080
either nerfing or buffing stuff like for a demo you're already pretty polished like you're already

171
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,920
kind of sparkling uh dev team I think you did a good job but that's just my that's just my biased

172
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,880
opinion because it's a super easy game to play and then doing my humble opinion converts all

173
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,240
blocks into strength at a 4 to 1 ratio I'm not sure about that attacks the nearest enemy for 1 to 5

174
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,960
applies 5 poison to the last enemy in the lineup I'll take that I'll take that

175
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:50,240
oh you can go for health if you need it and just random coins right we'll go for the piggy bank

176
00:18:50,240 --> 00:19:01,520
midas's touch any meters hashtag any meter that couldn't have gone worse that couldn't have gone

177
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:09,440
worse okay our first boss in his name is prick wood the the dev team is not brash you can't tell me

178
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,280
the dev team is brish for real for real um absolute tragedy

179
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,640
oh no wait he's oh no just because I have one anyway so he's still gonna have poison damage so

180
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,720
we now have like introduced tick damage if you will which is really good what is he gonna do this

181
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,960
enemy intends to buff itself or other well he's on his own some so I think he's gonna buff himself

182
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,560
deals one damage to the attacker when being attacked right so I'm actually gonna get hurt for once

183
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,840
it took me to the boss to get hurt so I think I don't know maybe they'll balance the game a bit

184
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,640
less in the players favor to make it I don't know if they wanted like a binding of Isaac

185
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:02,000
experience where you can like fucking lose um because that's all that game is just absolute misery

186
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:12,080
I am absolute misery I spewed on me I've lost health um there's not been any updates that I've seen

187
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:19,200
by the developer that's handling multiplayer for binding of Isaac I'm just patiently waiting um

188
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,680
I thought that was gonna get either of the sword or the shuriken but that didn't work

189
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,320
I spit back on him

190
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:41,920
yeah we'll go for the big sword bigger isn't always better but for some reason it is in this game

191
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,400
I can't believe this this game aged terribly and it's not even aged oh it's not even a baby but

192
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:53,600
yeah they have like 22 reviews I'm so tempted to like put a review just to like help them out the

193
00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:01,120
devs because I think they say reviews really help out um because people want like opinions of those

194
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:08,480
who've played it before and you know you're the first time you consume a game is really important

195
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:15,760
because like you might see something that you don't like and it can sway your opinion before

196
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,400
you've even touched the game so I don't know if we should like write a review together at the end

197
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,560
as well just to make it super nice and then you can see it on steam it just says like scrawny calls

198
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:34,160
I got to play this game um on stream and together we were having a blast like mucking about a wish

199
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,120
listing it and review it makes or breaks wish listing it I didn't know about the wishlist thing

200
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:46,800
I do I do see creators being like please wishlist this but I never understood like why is it because

201
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,400
it gets like pushed advertised more like more sales if it's been in the wishlist like percentage

202
00:21:52,400 --> 00:22:02,160
wise instead of just like watching as a dev a hundred a cabillion percent agree with this

203
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:11,120
trying to get solid feedback is invaluable and super hard to get yeah wishlist helps the algorithm

204
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,720
on steam holy shit we're breaking the steam algorithm with this one and we're hacking it we're

205
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:23,200
in boys the steam algorithm I never even thought about that but yeah like so because the name of the

206
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:32,400
game is dungeon crawler every time you search it up sadly google is like did you mean dungeon crawler

207
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:39,760
you dumb peasant and it's like no there's actually a game so I hope I hope that they don't run into

208
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:46,640
too many issues with it and like it took me a hot second to get the title right for the stream

209
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,800
um I think it took me like three attempts to spell the game correctly and I just gave up and

210
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,800
looked at someone's review and copied the title from the review because I was like I can't even

211
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:02,960
figure out I'm having a stroke um right junk jet deals one damage to a random enemy each time

212
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:13,040
an item is added to the machine after the first turn interesting you heal five increase critical

213
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:20,080
hit chance by five why do critical hit why not reward these crack for the floor will break when

214
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:26,880
walking and develop will prevent you from going backwards so fight fight fight fight and then it's

215
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,040
either potential machine use your coins to gamble no I need the much money use coins to

216
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,880
upgrade weapons okay that one's definitely what we're doing we're going down but again

217
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:48,000
introduce to new enemies uh a whiz club uh cloppers in my game we're likely leaving you think

218
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:56,320
they can heal and then little slime boy uh wants to block and but yeah we're definitely

219
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:04,640
needing to get our damage up because I think we're about to take a wall of thin slightly uh or I'm

220
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:15,600
starting to worry we're about to take a wall of thin um yeah maybe moment you can make a steam

221
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,800
curator page where you have a list of recommended games you've played I didn't know that my profile

222
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,480
is private though I don't think it would work which is a shame did I get walloped oh no I didn't

223
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,480
take it I don't know how I didn't take any oh they're all hitting for 15 and eight

224
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,360
okay let's do the poison one as well I wouldn't mind a cheeky bit of poison on the last guy so

225
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:49,680
it's not too hard to defeat okay that okay this we're about to take a uh oh dear yeah we're needing

226
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,480
damars would anyone like to offer us damars

227
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:03,520
I hate that I know what cloughing is wait I thought a cloffer was someone who's in a my

228
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,000
little pony and the popcorn that goes with it does that mean something else

229
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,440
have I been using that incorrectly and everyone's like oh my god you're such a

230
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,160
my little pony fan I'm like I don't even know what it means

231
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,400
no you understood that right okay right yeah

232
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:30,160
little pony sonas you can never look at me the same again after her pony sona streamer so cute

233
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,800
though no it's my little pony

234
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,320
isn't it right call machine in real life very so fun I want to try the full machines in Japan

235
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:53,920
Japan seem to have amazing like arcades and stuff um they know what the hook is I don't

236
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:59,200
know if you watch that series where it's like a day in the life in Japan and it's like and today

237
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:06,400
we're gonna watch what like a 22 year old casino worker does and I don't know if you saw that episode

238
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,240
it was fucking blaring oh my god it was like inside the parlor was just like

239
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,920
because it was so loud um

240
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,240
and it was like a constant noise I remember I watched aki dearest I don't know if you've

241
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:34,000
ever seen aki dearest um she's a youtube content creator for the girlies um and she did like a

242
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,760
video just talking about it in general and she ended up winning like the jackpot and she was like

243
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,600
she literally asked the people there like did you purposefully do that because they had to get

244
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:52,000
explicit permission to record first um and she was like and like she couldn't believe that she

245
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,840
hit the jackpot on it because she was like that set up but I'm pretty sure casinos like face track

246
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:04,480
you and stuff like they have insane face tracking and they'll identify if you are her new you're like

247
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:11,760
a new customer and like they can artificially up the win rate and stuff to get you hooked like it is

248
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:21,520
minor it is a minor um like don't gamble as much as I like to tease about balutro and like oh you're

249
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:29,680
gonna 99 percent of gambas quit before they win big they the manipulation is insane like I was

250
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:37,280
watching this documentary on a poker match that got uh rigged um and like it was showing you the

251
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:43,600
behind the scenes footage of what they can see and it's like just everything everything is monitored

252
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,880
everything is in the house's favor like call me a follow new vegas achievement because the house

is that the phase connect manager my is it I don't want to hurt him I thought he did good for his

292
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,680
talent am I going crazy I don't know maybe I've just not heard anything but I thought he did all

293
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:06,000
right for his talents I'm sorry phase connect there's nothing personal does anyone tend to add

294
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:19,440
items into the machine okay let's pick up the hammer please kindly right so 15 okay that was it though

295
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:29,600
it's so big um it's probably not even worth it to pick that up no no phase connect in the game

296
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:38,240
manager versus manager no I'm not a manager anymore you take five damage while it spikes

297
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,160
I've not healed either as is it actually I probably should have warned you before we watch this

298
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:51,440
there's a very high percentage we don't make this out alive I just want you to know okay I'm not

299
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:58,640
eh I've never played it before I was just going through it and before the only reason I caught

300
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:06,720
my cogs is because I ended up hurting myself I believe it I guess we'll go with poison damage

301
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:13,520
build up with the shurikens I feel like that's getting quite effective which I'm quite happy about

302
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,800
I maybe should have buffed the sword actually that's what I should have done see how this is too

303
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,160
big I should have buffed the we longer swords um

304
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,880
not me saying them joking then the first thing I read as an Irish man

305
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,320
hi Oregon I'm sorry what did you say as an Irish man I hear by Grant Stroni the

306
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,680
I word pass which entitles her to joke about Irish alcoholism and domestic terrorism with

307
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:47,520
a repercussion no you're not to give me permission for that song

308
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:57,840
I'm terrible eh okay I'm sorry face connect I did what I scuba had to do I can't remember

309
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:05,760
I was like I had to do what had to yaba daba do attract all metal items

310
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,840
that sounds OP

311
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,240
that sounds OP

312
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,720
oh my god it's so cute it looks like an axolotl oh it's called spookle hole that's so cute

313
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:29,360
and then a thorn but yeah so they're starting to get big because they can do two attacks now

314
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,880
oh wait what oh I thought the magnet went on the claw

315
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:43,760
what I thought the magnet went on the claw no no come on

316
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:53,360
hmm I was like mimic your mudkits hi little baby oh I'm so excited before come on I got um

317
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,080
we're gonna play are you sit right I hate this hammer so much I've learned my lesson I'm not

318
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:07,600
picking up the hammer again um cheap two dollar ass magnet honestly

319
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:19,120
and so we're gonna get stroney all the past no no why is that glowing what did you do

320
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:27,440
dodges one attack what they're haunted do you like hunt stuff why are they moving

321
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:35,040
I mean I'll just go for it but I think there's a ghost in my game

322
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,400
that's so spooky spooky maybe it's a buff for the first time right

323
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
that was trying to help me literally it's going halfway across the map

324
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:55,440
and the enemy perished that's cool small sword for attack attacks an

325
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,040
enemy for five damage and applies three poison yeah I like I like tech damage I've always enjoyed

326
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:08,240
poison in video games who are you night commander of the order of defender lot this enemy's gonna

327
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:15,840
buff itself well if he's not gonna attack me we can go all out on attack hopefully and just

328
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:28,320
kind of get a few 300 oh no oh no man I've got a bomb here I mean in video game in video game

329
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,040
in video game I'm sure the youtube AI knows when someone's playing a video game surely copium

330
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,280
surely the stream isn't gonna be deleted copium

331
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:51,840
no I think the youtube AI is rather curious at the moment so if you do live asmr it reacts

332
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,640
differently we've got wall up at 13 coming in

333
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,960
and oh my gosh that actually did hurt me I don't know if I should go all out and poison

334
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:09,200
not as dying on the second boss sorry I'm so bad at taking the wheel

335
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,560
can I like grab a ton of these

336
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,600
please I would very much like to win we've gotten by 100 down

337
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:26,320
195 health remaining I was 66 health remaining but he is taking tech damage block

338
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,160
does not reset you're cheating right I said get another bomb no

339
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:47,920
mommy you're the bomb I think they changed something cross the words yeah so if you do an asmr

340
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,800
live stream you'll be judged more harsher than uploading a video fail of asmr

341
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:02,960
I don't know why the AI would be different when it comes to the same content but that's why I've found so far

342
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:16,560
um so I'm not sure like I'm obviously I've actually my warning is about to expire on the 19th of

343
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,240
September when there was a time in September

344
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,680
um

345
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:33,520
but yes uh it's going to x I'm 32 health I'm out bro there's no way I'm gonna make it

346
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:42,320
onigai shimasu um it's ogre there's no way I thought this game was being easy to me

347
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,680
I don't want to start a new run because I suck

348
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,960
all right just give me all this damage please no

349
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,320
oh my gosh sorry wait hold on a minute wait why is he just absorbing everything

350
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,800
where's my poison blade it's down here are my shuriken I think I can't there's no way I can hit

351
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:13,360
the shuriken oh see you you freaking bam going halfway across the map you think you've been funny do

352
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:19,360
yeah all right the the poison's the only thing that's literally taking him down right now

353
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:27,520
I'm just trying to stack on it I really am I'll just grab all these what does this buff say

354
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:33,920
block does not reset between turns so like I'm having to do other things

355
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:43,520
and the claw takes half the things off I mean at least they got the game realistic when you play

356
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:51,360
the vending machine games in real life the the claw be wide open I couldn't give less of a oh my god

357
00:40:51,360 --> 00:41:00,320
the full poison damage saved us each attack applies one poison I love poison weaklings no you're my

358
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:10,240
strengthlings no no you're my strengthlings you're not my weaklings at all my poor babies

367
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:25,280

369
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,600
between floors so if I'm playing it a bit risky by the boss fight that's okay I get fully healed up

370
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:47,760
it's really rested hmm I some is a little too good worry talking about hey shit his bridges

371
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:56,000

372
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:07,440
we do gardening work callers weaklings we feel exhausted after a lot of physical labour callers

373
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:19,840
weaklings we what does the word make mean me okay I forgot more than I just picked up

374
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:26,400
all those freaking spikes what is that the enemy intends to attack you reflex reflex wet

375
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:37,920
we're working bomba let's get some defense going I think make means quiet and shy flirt

376
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:50,560
with refling make him a meekling okay thank you what other words we read let we observe literature

377
00:43:50,560 --> 00:44:03,040
together callers readlings oh um what other words gonna think of rate of this very moment in time

378
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:18,720
we enjoy playing video games callers geeklings there's a sniper down main callers peaklings

379
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:26,560
we like sucking mummy's toes callers freaklings

380
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,040
attack the first enemy for two damage then damage is multiplied by strength I don't know

381
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:41,520
what strength though is as few reasons your strength by two attack the first enemy

382
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:50,640
right let's just put a strength okay okay what's mystery room uh ooh

383
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:58,240
a part of the room is occupied by a small pond the air feels moist and warm what do

384
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:04,560
you do drink from the pond bottle some pond water sure you filled the pond water and receive

385
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:12,960
poison flask well I'm glad I didn't drink it jeez um okay let's upgrade some stew

386
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:20,400
we like eating mummy's food callers eatlings callers architectlings right what did I get

387
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:29,920
doubles the nearest enemy's poison because you're poison I wouldn't mind because this is small

388
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,120
yeah seven damage and six poison yeah I'm happy with that what about

389
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,520
were you 10 yeah you're worth it because you're worth it

390
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,240
we do a bit of pondering callers thinklings

391
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,000
we discuss our special interests callers kinklings

392
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:05,440
um it's becoming quite a nice deck yeah each attack applies one person

393
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:12,880
start each fight with three strengths I don't I don't know what strength does but I'm going

394
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:19,680
all out on it I said what I said right we'll do the fight because let's see what we're enolizing

395
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:25,760
whoa that would have been such a good I would have been able to see what the poison kind of

396
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:32,320
does there whoa poison's the way to go

397
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,800
and upgrade in the attacks or the way to go because

398
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,160
he's already down

399
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:53,680
stab a gator he must be British we haven't showered in a week cause thinklings no not

400
00:46:53,680 --> 00:47:02,560
pheromone links holy moly we are shredding okay we definitely need to um do our thing

401
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,720
attacks the nearest enemy for 15 decreases the damage by five each time it's used reset after each

402
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:17,760
fight so in theory that would be useless if we accidentally get picked it up okay poison I just

403
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,320
want to I just want to go out on poison sorry I always find poison in games so satisfying like

404
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,720
I remember playing darkest dungeon and I wanted to just use poison all the time and then I got to

405
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:32,080
the poison spore like sewer's area and it was never working and I was like what's the point

406
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:38,400
it's literally the best thing in game I feel so personally attacked oh you can reroll oops

407
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,840
yes I can but I'm going to keep my money for upgrades because that literally has like thrown

408
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:50,960
his head and I buy it crazy am I seven poison

409
00:47:50,960 --> 00:48:03,360
uh let's just grab the him yep I suppose the magnet definitely does actually pay off as much

410
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:09,360
as I want to be a little hater all right that's definitely paying off the beeflings

411
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,640
feed my reflexly puts weight on calmer beefling

412
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:21,760
you'd love the silent and sleigh the spire then she poisons everyone then blocks all their hits

413
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:30,000
in the meantime wait I get to play as her or a man trouble and I go against her oh that looks like

414
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,160
tell me the shape of this little poison I know it's rather small on your screen

415
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,760
tell me it doesn't uh oh you get to play as her okay we're on it

416
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:51,520
attack the nearest enemy dealing 0.5 damage for each missing health attack the nearest enemy for

417
00:48:51,520 --> 00:49:00,880
five damage increases damage by five each time it's used wait what increases damage by five each

418
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:11,760
time it's used 10 15 20 25 attack the last enemy for three damage and shrink three items

419
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,840
to make them smaller to put in the

420
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:24,480
fit a refill and up my call on my plug link that sounds like drugs though plus

421
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,240
heat gun seems okay yeah to shrink three items to make them smaller to come inside the claw

422
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,920
heat gun or skip look at heat gun not you guys already have an experience with this game

423
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:43,760
right let's try and grab more money this time four to ten or actual one singular fun

424
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,240

right so okay I like super shrinks them so definitely can pick up more let's grab a big

429
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:24,800
healthy hearting of items we like gambling calls gambling no you're not to gamble reflects the next

430
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:34,320
attack our default back to the channel oh I didn't mean that no I meant to press

431
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:42,480
oh a waste of a turn I meant to press the like over a bit and that was a waste of a turn as well

432
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,800
you know what I'm actually throwing you know what enemy turn

433
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,680

438
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:37,760
uh I don't even know what to do because I'm gonna pick up like literally four here and four here

439
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,440
you poisoned yourself literally I don't think there's anything I can do

440
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:56,000
other than just take the L oh wait oh it went against me because of his little silly

441
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,200
redar buff thing but in general it would go against him

442
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:05,680
huh

443
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:13,040
just gamer problems when you play game for the first time and I've completely effed that round

444
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:23,440
up okay so poison damage if I could get the the the plug link then if he's got 42 does

445
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:32,400
that make it 84 I'm gonna see if I can get it and we're gonna test if I can get 84 because

446
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:39,680
that would be pretty wild 84 oh Ken wet Ken wet

447
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:54,480
oh no oh go away go away is that why is that why I would want to skip the turn because he's got

448
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:02,080
that horrible thing on him what a rubbish turn what is he gonna do this enemy tends to modify items

449
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:14,000
in the machine I'm just getting shacked this is the it's not looking good

450
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:24,080
I don't want to so he's got that reflects the next attack or debuff back and he's gonna hit me for

451
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,440
20 and have 44 health oh

452
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:39,440
the shaggy suit what is gamba name is this it's called dungeon clawler and I think I've just

453
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,800
perished myself because I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do yeah I'm taking damage for that

454
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,840
that is an insane debuff like actually batshit insane

455
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:01,040
I don't know what to do about it like other than maybe just go for hell yeah like that

456
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,760
what was the button to skip a turn

457
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:12,400
uh hold on I don't know the button to skip the turn was

458
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,640
shies can anyone remember backspace

459
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:26,000
oh my god I actually saved myself because I was smart enough if you only pick a single item it

460
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:33,840
turns no reduced price for all services whenever you take any damage one remaining item from your

461
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,840
deck is added to the machine

462
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,480
maybe

463
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:52,240
gotta go work have fun I'll catch up all day I have fun at work me plan

464
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:59,280
call him he has to go to work call him work link I have to go to work right so that's the boss there

465
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:09,520
fake fake fake fake mystery room I guess we could just do the whole place I just like hit more time

466
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:21,440
right okay I'm fully healed up I have no health getting items that's my only concern about doing

467
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:32,880
this full dungeon is that I have nothing to protect like to reheal before the boss fight

468
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:40,240
if I start going about shagging everything in this I'm already taking damage

469
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:48,960
also how did I end up with two claws I thought you had to unlock that that was a freaking

470
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,120
steal that round though holy moly

471
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:01,520
right we literally just need one more thing to attack I think we got it that was a really good

472
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:09,280
one it's a jobby someone who goes to work no a jobby means a shite in scores attack the nearest

473
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,520
enemy for five increase block by 10 when picked up double

474
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:21,920
just keep doing poison all in baby an ancient looking chest sits in the middle of the room

475
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:29,280
what do you do open it hit the chest walk away open it was a mimic chest

476
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:39,920
bro I trusted you a little mimic chest and how do you repay my efforts

477
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,040
don't shuffle you always have two turns before the enemy does something

478
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:54,160
uh I don't actually want to waste an attack in quotation mark on that first enemy because he's

479
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:59,200
about to pop his wee clogs but I guess that comes with this kind of gate turn based game

480
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:04,960
mechanic you gotta fight who comes up first you can he just be fighting anyone can he just be going

481
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:15,120
through it just say you hate me honestly just say you hate me it's easier it's easier okay that was a

482
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:24,640
weird shot oh just and no more I think we actually might lose which is unfortunate

483
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,720
we'll go to the blacksmith and upgrade what we can

484
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:39,680
uh body armor attack hammer rewarded yeah I want to do that okay one more fight and then

485
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:46,000
we can go upgrade were you oh my god you're like those pokemon in like generation seven that I never

486
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:54,080
kept up to date with I'm sorry the new pokemon I can't keep up with it back in my day there were

487
00:57:54,080 --> 00:58:03,360
literal pixels on a screen because it was pixel art um I think we're gonna do pokemon ruby but

488
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,760
actually I was thinking instead of pokemon ruby we might do pokemon white or black just because

489
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:15,040
that was like a highly rated one um and I think people might like it more like because of the

490
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:22,480
art style and stuff but oh my god how just pick up what's

491
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,480
I'm just we being trolled right now because what's going on

492
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,840
like I'm actually about to lose just pick up what's there

493
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:47,600
it's not that hard how did you have eight I mean at least it's not attacking right I said

494
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:57,120
we're gonna learn poison on this or so okay poison poison poison uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah

495
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:07,440
straight build up that poison make a regret being born yes I'm not losing it I'm not gonna

496
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:16,720
I'm gonna get normal ruby or a mega ruby oh maybe we should do a mega ruby I completely

497
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:24,080
forgot they did that taxineers enemy fuck it we'll do a lucky stick we might roll big

498
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:29,600
right I would like to buff

499
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,800
poison for 21

500
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:49,600
uh-huh and then upgrade my but for triple damage that's pretty crazy

501
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:56,960
strength and all that I don't have enough to do anything else I'm wondering if they had

502
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:04,000
for these crazy kinds of gamble gamble try to collect different awards from the small machine

503
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,840
I honestly don't even know if we're gonna make it to the boss fight

504
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:18,240
uh honestly dinny can add dinny can because I keep messing up poison maxing literally it's

505
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:25,280
my favorite type of attacking game like if we're talking on skyrim terms obviously it's

506
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,720
two handed then it goes bow and arrow but I would do poison if it wasn't so tedious which

507
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:40,960
sounds terrible oh my god I'm gonna game over no right we're doing another one wait oh no well

508
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:49,600
it's a demo so I wouldn't save but yeah that is the core mechanic of the game I definitely need

509
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:58,480
to pick a heal because that was a bit silly a bit silly willy a bit silly belly a Skyrim stealth

510
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:08,880
archer I've always wanted to try it to be a stealth archer in Skyrim but I just can't stick it out I

511
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:15,200
get so annoyed when the enemy's like two centimeters from my face and I literally have a bow and arrow

512
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:23,440
like sticking out um like right in their face like how's it what you're doing please do not

513
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:28,240
the strong tingle seller I'm going to bed I need your strongest tingles I have good news for you I

514
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:36,640
have another rambling ASMR on the way so for 5k it was supposed to be me tapping on stuff but

515
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:44,240
you know me I was getting distracted so it's like 25 minutes of like rambling ASMR

516
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:51,120
and then I've just got a no talking one coming out after that back to back um I did

517
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:59,600
uh two collab scripts and I sent them away uh one collab partner already responded the other

518
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:09,840
needs time to cook um yeah I've got a bit of work done um scrappy sir buns a lot strange

519
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:15,680
cousin who's obsessed with metal probably cuz he grew up in a scrapyard oh reward for completing a

520
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:25,440
run oh they already have the the first claw next turn will be a big magnet that attracts all metal

521
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:34,640
sounds pretty cool oh my gosh is she be Felina Felina was always made fun of because of her love

522
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:39,520
of carnivores she swore that she would one day tame a tiger but so far she's only managed to tame a

523
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:47,920
house cat that's so she be she literally has her wee a kiddies the booty lord thank you for the

524
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:52,960
super chat you never intend to come to stealth art it just happened I tried to do it and then I

525
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:59,040
always end up two-handed heavy armor like without fail or actually two two-handed light armor because

526
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:05,360
of the thief's guilt armor literally I love your latest patreon audience for me oh I thought they

527
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:13,760
were a bit um how many characters have they got you regenerate one health when you deal damage

528
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:20,080
oh that might actually be better for me though cream puff fights at your side for three turns

529
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:27,600
oh I think I'm gonna dolly no one really knows where dolly came from one day they just showed up

530
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:33,680
in the dungeon most assumed that dolly is a discarded pin it's embers literally look you've

531
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:39,040
got your little heart at the front as well for the bleeding heart hey not the bleeding heart the

532
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:48,400
pin pals is that the fight of 87 or deal 20 damage to yourself in one term to unlock it

533
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:58,640
she increases strength by three bad stress falls bent whoa what they have so many

534
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:07,920
characters right well please forces your pet as much as I want to play as she be I feel like

535
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:15,120
I'm only gonna win on the vampire fang I'm sorry she be forgive me forgive me there's a lay

536
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:21,920
mmm it's a make she be they're kissing right now the billy audio was great gonna listen to

537
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:30,000
the click this one I thought I hope you enjoyed it um as I said we're gonna write the next one

538
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:37,360
together because I always find them more rewarding right so our deck is very small right now so

539
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:43,040
we're really just gonna blast through it but yeah we're getting a little little green number ones

540
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:50,640
hey yeah I think I think this game's got a lot of potential it'd be very interesting to see how

541
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:57,280
it transpires how it evolves as I said the only thing I can imagine that the dev team really

542
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:02,800
need to do is just update more items maybe more characters I don't know if they want to deal see

543
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:12,320
it um fills the machine with water no removes all stacks of poison now attacks the last enemy for

544
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:17,200
five and heals your health wait why didn't I not unlock that in the other one that seems so much

545
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:21,360
better literally right we're health maxing this game I'm not even kidding we're health maxing

546
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:28,400
can't wait to see the scrawny characters are going on could you imagine if the devs are sitting

547
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,400
watching this right now and they're like yeah yeah you know what we're gonna we're gonna put a

548
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:40,320
slag in it fuck it we'll put a slag in it hi dev team how's it going easy it's not small it's at least

549
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:50,160
average I'm sorry your decks only got three to it that's right I'm deck shaming different

550
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:54,720
characters get different items yeah speaking of different

551
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,080
I tried to turn but I got too shy and it never came out

552
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:13,040
right we're health maxing sudden tentacle call girl oh could you imagine little slimy girl I get to

553
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:24,400
play I want to be all slimy and tentacle yonk yonk yonk and then drop it down

554
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:33,520
and then we did it and we didn't take any buzzes free that's an improvement credit card

555
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:40,080
attract the first enemy for one dart what oh attacks the first enemy for one damage

556
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:44,480
spend five points and permanently increase is that mixed by two

557
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:56,320
what like two to four to eight no that's broken I feel like it would be highlighted if it was

558
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,040
super rare attack the nearest enemy for 10

559
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:13,760
slamlings rise up considering the size of the reefland three is a big comparison body size

560
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:24,080
honestly I was reading my my special interest and it was the one I remember and it was so cute

561
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:31,120
and I love it here's five coins time to power up thank you momo honestly turns water into poison

562
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:37,120
water but I'm not poison immune there must be a poison immune attack the nearest enemy for 20 but

563
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:49,440
lose five health fucking hell right we'll do that only because we make health back right get

564
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:57,040
thank you momo for the super chat we're powering up small thanks I want the sword to be small

565
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:02,960
because if it doesn't fit in the claw swamp there's always 20% water I don't know why you don't like

566
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:09,760
can if you kill a poisoned enemy apply apply it's poison stacks to the other enemies oh my god this

567
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:18,560
is a game for me I'm sorry I love loved me poison love me damage simple us we do need just need to

568
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:29,120
get poison weapons though because we don't have any poison at all right now um we're trying enemy

569
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:38,080
turn oh we have no defense actually took me how many rounds to figure out we have no defense I'm

570
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:44,880
going to see if I can get that healing wand um have a good nap yeah the game too cozy you can't

574
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:29,040
wrinkly parts of my brain and it's just AC going a true gentleman and then a gong gets hit actually

01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:33,200
I might be able to have it because I've been putting in the discord like I don't really like it hold on

581
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:14,160
attacks the enemy with poison yes that's what we want we want a poison max because we have

582
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:17,920

two gentlemen gong okay that was good money that's the first time we've actually got that

584
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:35,600
right let's do poison and every time I do an attack I get a bit of health back

585
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:43,600
see I got four for that round and then we can grab the magic wand which does five damage as well as

586
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,240
heal for four on top of what the wand will offer yeah

587

590
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,800
I don't have to put on the stem board I can pick something else from icicle

591
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:25,200
I keep hearing a stem board oh my god actually it is a stem board

01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:23,360
I've watched your ASMR now I'm autistically info dumping about hypno to my girlfriend

01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:28,800
your special interest isn't contagious I just think hypnosis is really neat I just

602
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:37,920
like when I was doing research a lot of the same subjects kept coming up and it was kind of like

603
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:46,480
safety was a massive one like some people were just going absolutely green eggs and ham on it

604
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:52,640
throughout history is my is Brian working have I heard Brian all day at all today

605
01:12:53,200 --> 01:13:02,480
I just fixed it I just fixed Brian hold on let me replay that I just fixed Brian

606
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:08,960
I was like I've not heard Brian all day throughout history a lot of female killers preferred weapon

607
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:20,080
was poison care to explain yourself mama I don't know maybe because we're not as strong so it's

608
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:27,600
easier to just kind of be like oh fancy a shag and then stab them poison

609
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:36,640
I see if that's how it works right okay we can get shield I think we're gonna have to do shield

610
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,280
so it was seduction the art of seduction

611
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:49,920
um okay Brian's back I'm sorry Brian got scared thank you the beauty lord for the

612
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:57,520
thingy stab with poison spiders do it too the widow spider

613
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:09,120
oh my gosh we should get a puppet girl and then her motto will be stuff me

614
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:15,600

616
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:30,320
yeah that'll be her I'll make you a deal if I make a puppet girl that'll be her her code

617
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,520
sentence on the website is why don't you stuff me wink wink or something like that wink wink

618
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:42,480
and we're like um a puppet girl I love creepy little girls I've already said this before I just

619
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:50,960
find the design like 10 out of 10 um attacks and heals yeah I'm I'm good to double down on healing

620
01:14:50,960 --> 01:15:03,680
this run and give it a good shot right poison get it up heals maybe should have invested a little

621
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,880
bit into that but hey ho

622
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,280
like a floggle a groke at cuckoo

623
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,160
I love when I upgrade the poison and there's like one

624
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,800
that would actually be great a sea slug gen mate sea slugs can be so creepy

625
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:30,400
uh I'm open to anything for the most part as much as I joke about like no Zee Broker

626
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:35,680
why is it so big did that click that frog did that on purpose

627
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:46,080

628
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:53,280
so would we be puppet masters I think they are okay slime girl

629
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:58,880
which don't say those words around me again

if there's a chicken nugget can our website thing be did somebody say can see that's awful

631
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:18,000

632
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:27,600
so no slime puppet girl no no slime I've said dark sword deals 25 damage to news

633
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,560
anime lose to health for each item that gets picked up in the same town

634
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:40,080
is it bad that cuz we're a vampire I'm making it bad I feel like 25 is so OP like it's worth it

635
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:47,920
um watch me get like a I was joking all right there you go literally the perfect role

636
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,960
wait why did I get hurt you're such a wee thiber we already have a girl that's a slacker

637
01:16:54,960 --> 01:17:02,880
named a strong what I have dare you are you squiddling me are you dare you level five would

638
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,840
L happy one month strong he's still gunning for the mouse train girl conductor to be honest

639
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:13,120
that is definitely a choo choo who wants to run a train on me type type uh

640
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,960
oh I've poisoned myself straight uh

641
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:29,920
I still think we're okay but no did I just get stuck up there I guess maybe when we drift oh

642
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:37,360
oh we did it block attack the nearest enemy for 15 and remove its block that sounds good to me

643
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:44,800
so is what it does um thank you again for the extended membership the mouse girl was a very

644
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:52,080
interesting it's just because she's a bit uniform and I don't want sheepster's toes being stepped on

645
01:17:53,920 --> 01:18:00,640
especially if you're taking like a core design element like if you boil everyone's like designs

646
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:01,920
down into something

647
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:11,280
you gotta boil you gotta boil my daughters to to see what honestly I kind of missed that magnet

648
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:18,720
I'm not gonna lie that magnet was kind of kicking uh right so he's got like an infinite block so if I

649
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:31,440
use the war hammer on him is he gonna still have a block he is but it appears I can boil the

650
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:36,240
daughters to get to the broth I'm so excited to make my next move already I'm gonna give my

651
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:45,040
leftover soup to the birds and Gimli and Vigo have been loving loving watching me feed the birds

652
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:52,080
um I just put leftovers outside like I don't put leftovers in the bin because in Australia they

653
01:18:52,080 --> 01:19:01,280
don't have so like compost bin like in Scotland the council like takes it away it's like this

654
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:06,640
wee fucking shitty plastic half not plastic bag and it's fucking shitting fucking shitty pissy

655
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:12,800
fucking thing and you put your food scraps in it so it doesn't go in the main bin um

656
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:19,840
but I put all any and all food outside so either the bugs get it or the birds get it and it's the

657
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:27,360
circle of life and uh Gimli and Vigo lose their shit when I start putting food outside because

658
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:33,760
they're so adorable they know what's coming and like all these different types of birds come down

659
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:39,840
and it's so nice to see like the diversity of bird types as well because like I feel like in the UK

660
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,880
it's like either seagull or pigeon pick your poison if you're lucky you might see a robin I

661
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:50,240
actually got to see a few robins which I was really happy about they're so beautiful um with

662
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:59,440
like the red crest on them um I just find it stunning do you have magpies I do they're very

663
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:09,920
friendly um I've named them strony and strony's dad basically that was shite try again um

664
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:17,280
because there's a dad magpie and a daughter the mum doesn't seem to like me that much

665
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:27,360
um she seems a bit more hesitant whereas the dad magpie's like so close to eating out of my hand

666
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:33,600
like so so close I'm not even kidding um I like birds I just think they're neat

667
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:43,680
but today I'm gonna get a big boy nap and then I think I might be reading a book to

668
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:51,200
no no weaklings again I don't know maybe we should lower that seems really OP if you think about it

669
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:59,120
increase maximum health by two no no by pets you can have pets no I think we'll do weakling

670
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:07,520
unironically um mystery room blacksmith perco mat and then Ben pushing cook now we'll go up

671
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:17,600
um a big boy nap mail on stream it's me I'm the mail all along you thought I was gonna get a

672
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,400
butter appendage I already got it

673
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:35,040
how about a harpy girl I'd be down for that um if you're asking if one's being developed then

674
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:44,640
no one hasn't been developed and I love pappy from monster misumi I don't care what anyone says

675
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:50,400
peak design harpies with the wings and everything peak design gorgeous design

676
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:57,600
one of the best designs um oh so he's slimy oh it just got slimy

677
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:03,920
all these weapons are getting rather big

678
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,920
hmm

679
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:16,640
hmm they're getting a bit okay what about the egg laying aspect of harpies

680
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:28,320
so I'm happy to discuss it if you are I sent off some notes um and for the for the birthing bros

681
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,880
I had you in mind

682
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:40,320
and uh but the lord did not it it didn't work out and I didn't get what I wanted

683
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:45,200
doesn't mean it might not be developed in the future but uh that one of the traits was you

684
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:53,600
need to help her pass an egg and I was thinking about you birthing isn't birthing an egg I don't

685
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:58,480
know I don't know what it's what it's called if it's like a wee thing

686
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:08,320
honestly I think we're fucking tearing them up mystery room you see a small spring in the middle

687
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:13,200
of the room the water meets the faint goal what do you do take a bath you shoot and regain 10

688
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:19,920
health that's not bad do harpies have a cochella isn't that a music please

689
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:31,520
uh right 25 damage if I pick that up 35 damage oh 35 though

690
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:37,840
see that would turn that up to seven and 20 health regain potentially

691
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:43,440
we are not struggling with health oh we can do two

692
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:56,240
hmm I'm going to do the weans because they show up more in the

693
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,920
they show up more in the wee thing reminds me of the episode

694
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:10,480
of interesting years cloca cloca I think it's called obvi no obvi poses what I do when I've

695
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:22,240
got an attachment my my income's out like bubba are they called like tapioca balls or something

696
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:30,160
like that like tapioca ball and critical hit chance remove three poison yeah I think we'll

697
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:36,560
move through poison we're kind of need to never have got our health and poison thing under we can

698
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:42,400
just max out on the damage platypus vtuber just kills you with poison loving bloom

699
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:56,240
bless her she she doesn't mean that holy moley that is incident as if you did a cheeky 20 on

700
01:24:56,240 --> 01:25:02,720
me get to fuck man yeah I'll show you a chance I'll show you a 20 cheeky damage get right I ask

701
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:08,640
a fault that's a fault applies five damage yeah we're going to start doing the poison arc because

702
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:24,320
we're needing it oh please please be nice to me oh my gosh that was so worth it okay you you fucking

703
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:32,800
moth bastard right I've got heels I've got shields I've got everything that I could possibly need

704
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:50,080
just say you hate me just say you hate me it's fine not how I lost my poison as well right

705
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:59,360
how do I deal with the poison thing does enemy tends to modify iron reflects the next attack or

706
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:04,800
debuff so what I should only do like a wee bit like

707
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:10,800
like does that work if I only do shield

708
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:19,600
or should I only do like one basic ass sword and then I only reflect a wee bit on me

709
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:23,120
eight times

710
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:33,360
did I die on him last time no I made it by the skin of my teeth

711
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:39,280
what a fucking job he honestly I'm dead holy

712
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:51,280
holy shit I'd need the magic staff to recover what I can

713
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:02,640
I do get vampire bite health but he does 20 in a go

714
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:12,720
oh right we need magic staff for heels like straight I don't know maybe the vampirism

715
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:20,640
can bring it back yeah I think the vampirism can bring it back and we'll grab this heel as well

716
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:25,760
okay the vampirism definitely can keep us up

717
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:31,120
oh my gosh okay vampirism OP

718
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:35,600
heal eight health if you kill an enemy with a critical hit

719
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:40,960
the first item each turn is used twice

720
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:46,080
heals one damage to a random enemy maybe critical

721
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:54,320
it's just because of his bullshit mechanic I don't think any other mechanic gives us problems like

722
01:27:54,320 --> 01:28:00,960
that great success every every time you see a job he I think of the of that

723
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:06,480
wait is it a job he makes you think of a

724
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,120
is that he's not possible is not possible

725
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:22,160
is the enemy turn oh I got a new short I got a short batch a AC has a new short batch on the way

726
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:33,280
so the sheepsters um uh AC's been cooking so snowberries and her harem

727
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:42,800
harem um have been uh turns water into lava why would that be advantageous

728
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:51,600
attacks sure 10 health is not to be snuffed up you see a small spring you should take the bath

729
01:28:51,680 --> 01:29:02,560
restore okay I'm making stuff don't again jump in the AC with a hand job oh that makes sense when

730
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:07,760
you rate it like that job be job right okay that makes sense hydration check

731
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:14,880
um but yes I've got new shorts on the way in that

732
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:19,920
uh icicle has some sheepsters has some

733
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:27,360
uh but yeah thank you for clipping the girls as I said it helps hunt down like stuff that

734
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:32,640
should be turned into shorts like Amy's been going freaking green eggs and ham on shorts

735
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:37,360
she's been churning out insane ones as well like the scripted shorts she's been doing are

736
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:43,360
absolutely like fucking golden they're so good and like they all have the potential to like

737
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:51,120
seriously get trending like that voice one no um the one where she did her voice

738
01:29:52,240 --> 01:30:02,720
um I thought it was really good like uh I think it has insane potential and the thing is even if

739
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:11,600
you upload a short and it doesn't get like trending right away um it can still um like get picked up

740
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:18,720
in the algorithm later that is the nice thing about YouTube that isn't quite possible elsewhere

741
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:24,880
you can always get picked up in the algorithm like my thigh cupping video that did really well

742
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:32,400
um it wasn't picked up in the algorithm until like day five statistically after 40 hours

743
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:38,480
if you've not been picked up then it's like done so but it is possible although rare I will say

744
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:44,880
it's incredibly rare like I've not really had it done to me much at all YouTube still has that

745
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:55,200
ability to kind of do that and so it is a bit interesting her real voice thing

746
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:58,320
ac clip with the penguin was cute weird game though

747
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:07,120
um her I was really surprised what ac's car nail exam

748
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:12,000
short doing so well but I think it was just maybe it was just like

749
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:20,240
it's adorable like hearing someone else's accent and then getting it tee he wrong a little bit

750
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:26,880
like I think people just found it adorable um but I'm so glad because ac was like really happy with

751
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:40,320
and her freaking tango ASMR stream so is to see it so blatantly oh my god oh my god um yeah you guys

752
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:48,960
have been absolutely cooking right poison seven damage yeah we'll do that shurikens yeah

753
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:52,720
um magic wand

754
01:31:55,760 --> 01:32:00,880
uh I guess we can actually explore because we have the ability to heal

755
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:07,040
we don't have to panic she's gonna get a lot exposure with the high

756
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:13,600
side game or something oh did it come out did it finally come out

757
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:24,560
there was the opportunity for one girl's thighs to go up and it was sheepster's thighs

758
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:31,440
that was decided the most recognizable um so sheepster's gold it

759
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:42,000
and I'm so glad very cute yeah she nanced it today oh that's cute I'm glad

760
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:50,240
um it was a very surprising opportunity I didn't expect I was like what do you mean

761
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:59,280
uh bomba uh and uh just like you know you got this opportunity I'm like fuck okay right uh put her

762
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:07,440
in um because basically it had to be who has the most recognizable thigh design and it was shebe

763
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:12,880
and obviously this took a lot away on the makin so she wasn't tan at this point

764
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:25,760
um or however you want to say it so I I'm really glad for her sorry if I sound a bit tired I haven't

765
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:35,520
had the best um but I'm gonna get a nap and then I might read I might be selfish and read a book

766
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:42,880
and uh make something smart uh energy drink no that's gonna make my heart explode I'll do it

767
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:54,880
do we roll doubles your block in general no spaky shield and gives you five spikes

768
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,400
and gives you five spikes

769
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:02,400
give me five

770
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:12,080
let's do that why not were you

771
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:24,560
oh no we we don't do we don't do that here we don't do that here

772
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:28,160
mm-hmm uh let's try and grab these two

773
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:34,000
you don't have blocks skip those oh do not

774
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:38,080
right we're not gambling get over that

775
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:44,720
geez they really give you a hard fight right before the boss fight I'm glad we have magic wand

776
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:50,480
like leveled up so much I definitely think that's gonna save her booty cheeks quite well

777
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:56,320
uh oh blocking doesn't work on this character at all

778
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:01,120
you think I would have noticed I'm like hmm

779
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:06,000
shan't be investing in that shit anymore

780
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:11,120
the more attacked I get and the more health back so

781
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,360
uh

782
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:18,640
you know I'm actually wanting smaller

783
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:28,080
oh I hit the side right when I said I wanted smaller weaponry I didn't mean like that 22

784
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:31,360
relax relax right give me the freaking heels

785
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:34,880
I hit the side again

786
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:38,720
hopefully that's enough

787
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:48,800
oh I really wanted a bit more health before going yeah um I hope this boss thing right I

788
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:55,600

792
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:25,680
bend over it was in the character description you think I would have noticed that you think I

793
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:30,960
would have noticed that start each fight with block while I cannae and no I don't want I don't

794
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:39,200
want water in the damn machine anyway so oh it's a moth again wait am I going mental

795
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:47,840

796
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:57,440
and then we'll grab the mirror no we won't talk to you I I was just being cheeky I was just

797
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:05,280
being cheeky oh oh do you want to do reflect attack you know what I want to do reflect right back

01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:25,040
right right I'll take the ale I'll take the ale and grab all this

801
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:41,040
shite basically so then his stupid eight mirror attack in piso how much damage do these do

802
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,040
fucking how much damage

803
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:53,040
I thought they weren't even gonna do that much

804
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:02,240
I would very much like this golden heel but I don't want to hit the side

805
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:13,840
oh please give me something good with that holy moly okay we're at 37 41 if I can get this heel

806
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:21,760
and the mirror I'll appreciate it oh my gosh that was like I can't even seem to figure out how to

807
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:28,320
like counter whatever that pitch was increase the amount of fluff in the machine no increase critical

808
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:35,120
hit chance retain well camp blocks it has to be what oh wait if we win this do we win this

809
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:47,760
we may win this right what are you reward reward upgrade do we purposefully go past the blacksmith

810
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:54,560
to get more money for upgrade who said we can't do that

811
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:00,160
okay I'll take it I'll take it I'll take it I'll take it

812
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:07,040
I think if we do this we may win win

813
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:12,000
do you see the upcoming balutro cloud what's happening

814
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:22,960
are they are all the playable characters some kind of rabbit uh it did look like that from the menu

815
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:29,760
I think you maybe look we ain't winning if I keep getting pills like this I don't know what

816
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:39,360
can I catch up on I'm on right now this is shit I'm gonna take a wall of pin okay we need to go

817
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:46,320
back to the blacksmith and upgrade our shit like right now I'm not laughing I'm not he horn

818
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,360
I would very much like that heel

819
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,600
and very much like that heel

820
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:58,000
heel for six

821
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:04,000
can't use it sure

822
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:14,480
I don't know if I'm gonna regret going like so early

823
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:18,640
what do you do

824
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:26,720
increases its damage by 10 so it actually doesn't increase its base damage gives you the bomb

825
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:34,080
buff explodes after two turns for theory okay I'm gonna go one more thing I can upgrade

826
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:41,440
types of nearest enemy for three increases your base strength to four

827
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:53,600
that's big that's too big I guess base damage bucket I don't know that's the thing about playing

828
01:40:53,600 --> 01:41:02,160
a game for the first time you can mess it up props on rain we've got bomb bar so we've got like

829
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:13,360
long term came to like damage coming up and I'm sure there's a much more whoa that was a

830
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:19,040
really good grab I thought that was all gonna come tumbling down to be on it wait how am I half

831
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:30,000
health already I would very much like those heels can I keep them both please you fried fish

01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:35,920
honestly I don't know why you thought that was good please heal

833
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:45,360
68 doubles your strength attack the nearest enemy no doubles your strength right let's do a little

834
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:55,440
detour I might just pick up the healing ones honestly they're like carrying me I know I

835
01:41:55,440 --> 01:42:00,880
know I have vampirism but I'm strueckle in I'm strueckle in

836
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:11,680
balutro and witcher balutro vampire balutro Dave the diver balutro among us

837
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:14,160
huh

838
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:21,520
wish I could stay longer no don't worry thank you so much for lurking in the shadows please don't

839
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:28,000
worry short us doing day and all that deep fried reefing

840
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:41,360
balutro went wild with a collapse I mean is a good game I saw there is another game it's called

841
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:50,160
like I can't remember it's about poker though it's kind of pixel like I think it was just bad timing

842
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:56,880
or something because you know but I might take a look into it's like really mischievous though

843
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:57,520
and different

844
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:06,640
I guess we roll because we don't have a use for money

845
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:08,000
fuck it

846
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:16,640
oh well we have money now I'll see if I can grab some cheeky health in that

847
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:22,160
reefing falls into the deep friarism that's horrible I would hate making that

848
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:30,640
I don't make normally like the funny hee hee right we're gonna clear a path to the boss by

849
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:36,480
taking out these two and then we're gonna go back and get fully healed up at that reward thing

850
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:42,080
that's you strength potion all right let's just grab some stuff

851
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:49,760
um mummy turning us into salt and pepper no I would never eat you except in the war

852
01:43:50,800 --> 01:44:03,520
I forgot to reply to that artist oh my god I feel so bad I'll try and reply after I've rested

853
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:11,120
we didn't salt shrivelers I think so I think you're like slugs if you put salt on it like

854
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:14,160
hurts that's not nice

855
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:24,640
we're just gonna be poisoned attacks the nearest enemy deal and 100% of your block is

856
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:31,360
damn it I don't have these I don't hear block the damage

857
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:38,560
I'll do the dagger the reason

858
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:48,400
is because the smaller the weapon like the more chance I can get more of it and get my vampire

859
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:54,640
health uh-huh but as I said we'll get this reward that's behind these little slimes

860
01:44:54,640 --> 01:45:04,080
yum yum yum yum yum yum enemy turn that purse slimes trying his best it's gonna annihilate

861
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:11,680
why did that go sideways I just had an image of us hanging out in the spot only for it to

862
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:17,040
the mountain we're in the large part in the sun no that's so mean it's like there's that artist

863
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:20,880
on Twitter that does that where it looks like a whole bunch of things that I feel like in the

864
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:29,280
details it's like absolutely atrocious oh I'm actually gonna skip yeah I know

865
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:35,440
bomba like bomba right rewards and then we're going to do the boss and then that's it

866
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:45,840
we'll see if we can do it uh I'm not sure how streaming friendly that's

867
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:55,600
ready melemon this enemy intends to add out into the machine and he's gonna do a block

868
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:04,080
curious can I start early on the bombs and reflect right I've got a bomb brewing in the

869
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:14,560
background and then should I do the strength portion maybe should do the strength portion if

870
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:28,560
I can get it though he's got 375 what are these melee bomb exposing deals 10 damage if it's not

871
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:32,240
removed from the machine deals 20 damage to the nearest enemy

872
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:47,600
what I don't understand that but when we grab this bomb here as well there's two of them

873
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:55,200
it's explosion city out here geez let's just like a free bomb stick in

874
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:10,960
he hits for 15 I need that like motherfucking healing right now he hits for 15 don't you think

875
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:17,360
that's a wee bit dramatic mate honestly I'm gonna see if I can grab this other heal that

876
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:24,720
was incredibly lucky I think we might have done it we'll whittle them down a half right he's put

877
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:39,280
bombs in I'm gonna heal I'm poison if it stayed but it didn't unfortunately no way we did it our

878
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:44,960
first one well it was in our first try but you know what I mean you know what I mean the first

879
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:55,440
try on the vampire we did it oh we did it against congrats you have beaten the demo against all odds

880
01:47:55,440 --> 01:48:02,800

895
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:19,280
and review it okay I thoroughly enjoyed the claw machine gacha aspect to this game I would never

896
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:31,520
have expected that a rogue like would be able to incorporate such a unique mechanic

897
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:41,760
um the even by a demo standard

898
01:50:44,240 --> 01:50:56,720
seeing the weapons unlocks and characters it is very clear the development team put a lot of

899
01:50:57,680 --> 01:51:08,000
love a lot of love and thought into this game I cannot wait for its release and to see what

900
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:18,560
else is inside yeah plop plop plop plop plop the dev team I enjoyed the game is like action

901
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:34,320
yes um only note which seems to be shared among other reviews and opinions is that SFX would

902
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:45,680
be a fantastic addition and I'm sure it's already being worked on it was just not pushed with the

903
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:58,000
demo not to not to uh also must not forget must not forget to mention the background music is

904
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:07,440
an absolute banger yeah that'll be a review I like the phase and be a little reference is

905
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:14,960
plop plop plop get the sprites overall were very cute um okay we compliment also

906
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:26,560
well maybe shouldn't say also the um the right design was what did you say was rather cute

907
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:37,680
and it was an enjoyable uh casual gaming experience in the terms of not having to

908
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:47,040
sweat it's literally uh I need to rephrase that but I want it to be like this is a nice casual

909
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:52,480
game also the sprite design was rather cute and it was an enjoyable casual gaming experience in

910
01:52:52,480 --> 01:53:04,720
the terms of not having to try hard I can see myself sinking many hours into this game once full

911
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:18,560
release happens so I can obtain all the unlocks I know for a fact they've got stuff unlocked so

912
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:26,400
review links we are we're reviewing can you read it or is it too small hold on let me make it bigger

913
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:33,280
so you can read it easier there you go much easier review I thoroughly enjoyed the claw machine

914
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:40,640
gacha aspect to this game I would never have expected that a rogue like with a K would be able

915
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:47,280
to incorporate such a unique mechanic even by a demo standard seeing the weapons unlocks and

916
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:52,880
characters it is very clear the development team put a lot of love and thought into this game

917
01:53:52,880 --> 01:54:01,520
I can't wait for its release but why is that wrong it is release it's release ah to and to see what

918
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:07,120
else is inside also the sprite design was rather cute and it was an enjoyable casual gaming experience

919
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:12,480
in the terms of not having to try hard I can see myself thinking many hours into this game once

920
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:17,600
full release happens so I can obtain these unlocks only note which seems to be shared among other

921
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:21,760
reviews opinions is that it's effects would be a fantastic addition I'm sure it's already being

922
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:26,160
worked on it's just not pushed with the demo also must not forget to mention the background

923
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:36,800
isn't absolute banger yeah it's like cute by scrawny and the reeflings what no that's cringe the dev

924
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:46,800
teams don't want to read that the dev teams want to read feedback that's cringy reefling

925
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:56,000
slam their paint is hard oh we're happy okay I'm gonna put that review on steam let me just

928
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:18,240

938
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:29,920
really hope she enjoys titanfall don't I don't know if I should DM her and be like there's a section

939
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:34,640
where you can skip by the way I guess really tedious if you don't know you're allowed to skip it but I

940
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:40,880
don't I'm not gonna spoil it I'm not I'm not gonna message her that or anything um I have titanfall

943
01:56:56,400 --> 01:57:01,680
funny moments in that I wonder I wonder if she's gonna make the same mistake I did where I thought

944
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:07,120
I was running up to BT and it wasn't BT at all I was like ah I don't know you leave me alone

945
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:13,040
um so that titanfall and line has come back a little bit let's go to multiplayer

946
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:18,320
and we ask you to forgive us for your cringe as we forgive those who cringe against us

947
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:23,440
if I shake the dev team hands which tentacle should I give them not your front right tentacle

948
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:33,920
ask your pintosh I think I'm like 99 percent sure a front facing tentacle what tentacle is the

949
01:57:34,240 --> 01:57:36,400
the on a cuttlefish

950
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:45,120
yeah it's your front two wow you have two what

951
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:48,880
and you have two

952
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:54,720
I think your front two arms do the thing

953
01:57:54,880 --> 01:58:04,240
you're front two arms have the ability to ink the rest don't but your first two do

954
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:09,440
I thought you knew I didn't know you had two winkeys

955
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:14,080
I mean that's why I've got two holes

956
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:22,480
one for each one literally no I said it first get wrecked I said it first I said it first

957
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:26,960
oh my god I didn't know you had two winkeys this whole time

958
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:35,840
what a strange little thing we are what's up with being cuttlefish honestly

959
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:43,600
hey we got two for double trouble here's our winky and take it double yeah that's right

960
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:48,640

961
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:51,360

962
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:59,200

969
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:50,800
with fire and then a member's ASMR where I'm actually gonna write a script and do ASMR

970
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:57,680
what a christmas miracle that's all I'm saying an absolute christmas miracle

971
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:11,360
and can't wait for the gas station it will say I don't want to set the world on fire

972
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:18,560
I bet she just yaps and says well I'm gonna like purposefully do ASMR and like trigger words

973
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:26,960
and stuff oh I can't believe it I can't believe the person that does ASMR does ASMR oh it's terrible

974
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:32,800
did I just flash my fanny I think I did I'm gonna I'm gonna pop myself down a little bit okay

975
02:00:33,680 --> 02:00:36,800
uh I'm uh I'm gonna pop myself who are you

976
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:44,960
I'm going to do it again and no don't cheer what you've done Mr. Ronnie I just feel bad I feel like

977
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:50,160
if you're handing money over for like membership ASMR it shouldn't just be me that divulges

978
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:53,600
I'll do I'll do one serious stream a month how about that

979
02:00:55,840 --> 02:01:00,160
I'm not sure if you did you better do it again for good measure you should be shamed for that

980
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:14,720
sigma sometimes we get tingles as a treat world on fire cake links oh she has a fat ass call us

981
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:19,600
cake click don't worry strong it's very easy for you to identify the inking

982
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:25,680
technical it's the one that's inside you oh that's good that's good I'll give you that I'll give you that

983
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:32,400
um you know I have to be shamed or the impromptu actually that reminds me the last two membership

984
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:37,680
streams and swapped because one was a yap and then the other one actually divulged into a script

985
02:01:37,680 --> 02:01:44,080
right and somehow but I passed that script on to the person that I'm collabing with a and another

986
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:49,600
girl also got it and she was having a blast reading it she was really receptive to which was

987
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:56,720
really nice and sometimes I feel like I'm bothering people I asked another girl for a collab I can't

988
02:01:56,720 --> 02:02:02,880
freaking stop but she was like oh I just ordered a 3d microphone and I'm like collab with me please

989
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:10,000
please I'll write the script I'll end it I'll upload it please it's really funny because some

990
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:15,600
vtubers that have agreed to collab they're like strongy I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I'm not recorded

991
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:22,000
it yet me who's like so far behind I'm like no no it's fine please delay it more so I have more time

992
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:31,360
um yeah you didn't ask me for a collab as if one of you own a 3d or in the first place

993
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:36,400
mommy's suddenly a pleasantly surprised you have two tentacles honestly

994
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:45,760
I'm be lining for the debut go yeah I want to wrap it up in a year basically um

995
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:51,360
I don't want to be a year into streaming and I've not achieved muggles the only goal I don't

996
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:59,520
think I'll achieve is the 100k gamer score unless we did like a marathon very close to the end

997
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:07,760
did I I didn't tell you my halo achievements popped up like yesterday whilst I was writing my scripts

998
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:15,440
I don't know what happened but it was like uh welcome uh 5g for the pillar of autumn or whatever

999
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:20,000
it was called and I'm like why are the achievements popping up now why didn't they pop up I literally

1000
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:28,080
played halo how long ago um so I do have some gamer score I know we played viva pinata and cameo

1001
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:34,160
uh we played skyrim but I didn't finish it but if the achievements are fixed we might jump back

1002
02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:40,080
in to get 100 skyrim although I'm a bit resistant to it at the moment because you know when you step

1003
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:45,200
away from a game too long you don't really want to get back into I don't know a controversy

1004
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:50,480
Todd Howard is not gonna like that I'm gonna have to whisper that one

1005
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:57,840
um Microsoft is slow at times I feel that yeah um

1006
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:14,160
he's still can't oh you can't remember where you were and feel like you should start all over

1007
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:19,520
yeah basically it's like oh I don't even know what stage we're at or I think we made it to rifton

1008
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:24,000
because I was talking about the house and rifton and that but yeah Microsoft about as slow as my

1009
02:04:25,120 --> 02:04:26,240
you can't even say that

1010
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:38,640
babe um skyrim is easy enough to jump back in yes I can I've 100% in skyrim before and like

1011
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:45,040
under 48 hours that includes the dlc in stores time stores time it's not stores time

1012
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:53,600
it's stores time stores time something like that something like that close enough close enough

1013
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:58,400
honestly call my technical the demo the way you're beating it what does that mean

1014
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:06,400
oh I get it I thought you were talking about demo man from team fortress I was like hmm I'm

1015
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:13,280
trying to put the pieces together how tnt beats you I'm sorry give me a stick goddamn those are my

1016
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:19,680
my hips um you got 13 year old save you jump back in

1017
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:28,400
moment I'm sorry I'm my brain okay I looked up the cult of the lamb gameplay and apparently it's

1018
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:34,320
like bang on 12 hours so I'm gonna purposefully play easy mode so the cult of the lamb stream

1019
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:42,400
might be our endurance but I have a dentist appointment to get my teeth cleaned uh so

1020
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:49,200
it's not on that day I'll need to look at my schedule because I actually don't know what my

1021
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:55,600
schedule is for next week I've already filled that out though um but yeah

1022
02:05:56,400 --> 02:06:04,640
as I said I'm gonna rest and then I'll leave that review and then you can publicly see my

1023
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:14,480
my little steam account uh bring the task down for some teeth cleaning ASMR they put like a sweet

1024
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:18,240
substance like on your teeth to protect them once they've finished cleaning them

1025
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:22,960
um and I'm always like hmm banana flavor or something like that I'm like in

1026
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:26,480
teeth things yeah I get my teeth cleaned every six months

1027
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:34,000
oh you don't get the paste it's like flavored paste and they put it on your teeth

1028
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:41,440
and then like they make your rinse and stuff mummies pearly white teeth no no my pearly yellow

1029
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:47,440
teeth unfortunately I was born on the mainland of the united kingdom which means my teeth

1030
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:53,600
unfortunately did not come out the way as intended let them bother me nun

1031
02:06:54,400 --> 02:07:01,520
yellow teeth tea drinker real Andrew some people are like really bothered about like

1032
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:08,560
having white teeth in that and I'm just like I don't know I don't even care I don't even care

1033
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:17,040
I think there there's them what is it called uh veneers there's been like a lot of problems

1034
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:23,600
with veneers because people have felt pressure to have like perfect like uniform white blinding

1035
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:28,560
teeth and it's like you know your teeth aren't actually supposed to be neon white right like

1036
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:34,240
you know they have enamel and stuff going on and on right I'm not saying they should be like

1037
02:07:34,240 --> 02:07:41,440
fucking orange or anything like that but uh banana tasted like bubblegum your spell

1038
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:45,440
reminds me of the stars not because it shines so bright because your teeth are yellow it's just

1039
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:50,320
the stars we could always do what Americans do and destroy their teeth with sugar and put in fake

1040
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:57,120
veneers oh no apparently the veneer they put it like on top of your shave down tooth uh

1041
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:03,600
I'm a big believer in like keeping your teeth unless you were born unlucky some people spawn in

1042
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:12,640
terribly unlucky terribly terribly unlucky and they you just straight up have like shit dental

1043
02:08:12,640 --> 02:08:19,600
genes and like your teeth are just shit they'll just randomly die off and give up and so don't

1044
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:23,760
like that's different but like veneers are so

1045
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:32,160
scary weary you should just get grills you want me to get veal or grills I don't know

1046
02:08:32,240 --> 02:08:36,000
they would fit my teeth because I don't have symmetrical teeth can you get grills if you

1047
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:43,760
have asymmetrical teeth or do they need to be symmetrical can you get grills if your teeth

1048
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:53,440
are throwing up gang signs okay that can you get your teeth aren't straight okay how about that

1049
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:58,160
we'll change it if you have crooked front teeth they fit because of the molding oh okay

1050
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:06,480
custom made I think they get fit yeah they're custom made in America though absolutely look

1051
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:12,400
custom depression debuff my teeth that too you can also depression debuff them apparently

1052
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:17,760
grills are very painful I wouldn't bother that oh it doesn't be damn my girl has grails new

1053
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:25,280
donathan no can you do my wait hold on how much how much for grills in Australia I was gonna say

1054
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:38,400
America but I would not put that on my teeth me if I had straight teeth I think vampire ones

1055
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:44,800
would look cool as fuck but I don't have straight teeth so they would just be like shit just like

1056
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:52,320
shit um I know it sounds weird but I kind of like girls with braces no no I get you um

1057
02:09:54,320 --> 02:10:02,240
yeah I never got offered braces because there is so my teeth aren't right but they're not like need

1058
02:10:02,240 --> 02:10:08,560
braces to be fixed wrong if that makes sense like my teeth just came out a wee bit a wee bit funky
