Development can be rough in a VTuber agency and yellow was no different.

00:04.480 --> 00:09.440
I knew from the beginning I wanted a hypnosis theme and it took quite a few

00:09.440 --> 00:12.640
attempts to become the cuttlefish you know and recognize today.

00:12.640 --> 00:16.640
Yes you are allowed to laugh, this was literally my first draft.

00:16.640 --> 00:22.320
I quickly was developed to be a cuttlefish early on but I took a very splatoonly

00:22.320 --> 00:25.120
vape which wasn't quite what I wanted.

00:25.120 --> 00:29.280
Then from this outline you can actually see my shape and pupils are already in place

00:29.280 --> 00:31.280
which is amazing.

00:31.280 --> 00:36.240
Then a big switch-up happened and I was drawn in a yukata with permanent swirl eyes

00:36.240 --> 00:39.920
which was later changed into my classic cuttlefish pupil eyes.

00:39.920 --> 00:44.480
Then finally we arrived at my pearlescent design and I am none other than

00:44.480 --> 00:46.960
Strony Cuttles at your service.
