0	5000	Good morning sleepyhead!
5000	10000	Good morning good evening good afternoon!
10000	15000	Good morning sleepyhead!
15000	20000	Good morning sleepyhead!
20000	25000	Good morning sleepyhead!
25000	30000	Good morning good evening good afternoon!
30000	35000	Are you ready to play puzzle game with me?
35000	39000	You can already see the first one.
39000	45000	Okay, so in order to link to it,
45000	48000	I'm going to have to constantly close the game,
48000	51000	well close it from stream, so actually close.
51000	55000	Okay, but I will link you this website.
55000	60000	It should have a little insert, so you can name yourself if you like.
60000	63000	You can do something humorous.
63000	66000	But we're just doing a test.
66000	71000	This is testing 250 pieces an image.
71000	77000	We'll just take a moment...
77000	79000	Yeah, that's not even names!
79000	83000	You're just spamming!
83000	87000	That was so quick!
87000	95000	So we're just testing if you guys are able to
95000	99000	figure out the 250 pieces.
99000	102000	I've got some cam music on in the background.
102000	104000	It's just a chill day today.
104000	107000	I've got a few funny images, but this is just the start,
107000	111000	so I just wanted to see how you guys do.
111000	113000	I'm going to put Azura together,
113000	115000	because Azura's got teal in her hair.
115000	117000	I can see AC's got blue over here,
117000	121000	so I'm just going to drag her over here.
121000	124000	Hello! Good morning good evening good afternoon!
124000	127000	I'm having to play Super Dipper safe.
127000	131000	My dad has fully come down with a cold.
131000	134000	Not me in the middle with my little scored eyes!
134000	136000	Um...
136000	138000	Mumme!
138000	140000	Um...
140000	142000	My...
142000	144000	Yeah, my dad's unfortunately come down with a flu.
144000	148000	I actually had to go to the pharmacy yesterday for him.
148000	151000	And like I explained what's wrong,
151000	153000	and they were like if he's not...
153000	154000	If he still...
154000	155000	He felt dizzy,
155000	158000	but he took some strong sleeping medication
158000	160000	that he got from the pharmacy,
160000	163000	and they warned him like they don't use too much of it.
163000	167000	But I don't know, he like phoned me after stream,
167000	168000	like I was only in the other room,
168000	171000	but he was too weak to like come out.
171000	173000	Um...
173000	175000	And he was like I feel dizzy,
175000	176000	so like I ran,
176000	179000	I got ready, went to the pharmacy,
179000	181000	and the lady behind the counter was like
181000	183000	unfortunately we can't do anything for that kind of thing,
183000	185000	if it's not better in 24 hours,
185000	187000	like go with the doctor.
187000	190000	So I'm currently quarantining myself from my dad,
190000	192000	but the problem is we're sharing a space
192000	194000	and I really don't want to get sick.
194000	196000	Um...
196000	197000	So I had take away,
197000	199000	and he's had subway.
199000	202000	Just to fill his tongue.
202000	205000	Oh, there's the top of my peril.
205000	207000	My head, please.
207000	210000	I can see that's my shell,
210000	212000	but it's not fitting anywhere.
212000	214000	Wait, that's my shell, is it not?
214000	217000	Oh no, that's my hair piece.
217000	218000	These are my two shells.
218000	219000	Where did I go?
219000	221000	I had my eyes here so I couldn't go.
221000	222000	Oh, there's me.
222000	225000	Okay, my shell goes here somewhere.
225000	229000	And then this is my other shell over here.
229000	231000	I'm gonna move these out of the room.
231000	233000	I'm not sure that they are.
233000	234000	Oh, sorry, sorry.
234000	236000	I'm stealing pieces from people's hands.
236000	237000	I'm sorry.
237000	238000	Right, this is a zero sleep,
238000	241000	because I can see that purple from anywhere.
242000	245000	But it's just a really chill day.
245000	247000	Um, nice and easy.
247000	249000	Um, I am...
249000	251000	Oh, you can't see,
251000	253000	because I'm a big hair, hold on.
253000	256000	Above, because I want to redact it,
256000	258000	you're redacted, redacted.
258000	260000	Thank you for censoring yourselves, Reeflings.
260000	262000	You guys are very smart when it comes to streaming.
262000	264000	You guys don't give yourself enough credit
264000	266000	for how smart or cool you are.
266000	270000	Um, I can see Mercy's head is being formed up here.
271000	274000	Right, someone has gone for the old top method.
274000	277000	So if we can drag a zero up here and Mercy up here,
277000	279000	we might be in somewhere.
279000	282000	Right, I can see that's a part of my shell.
282000	285000	Someone popped that up here.
285000	287000	Oh wait, I'll move a little bit.
287000	289000	I'm the dumbest Reefing love mummy.
289000	291000	Wait, maybe I should go this side today.
291000	293000	I don't normally go this side.
293000	296000	Or did I just need to be a wee bit smaller today?
296000	299000	Yeah, you can talk in game 2 if you want.
300000	303000	But yeah, I think he's going to get better soon.
303000	306000	He says he feels better, but he coughed up like phlegm
306000	308000	or something.
308000	310000	I can't remember what it's called.
311000	313000	Surprised we didn't have a mate,
313000	316000	a mate hunt or a mate ox, huh?
317000	321000	I don't know, you guys play so well in games together.
321000	323000	I think someone said a way of the go,
323000	326000	they were like, normally like whenever a streamer
327000	330000	does something multiplayer that could be easily ruined,
330000	333000	like the autism gets a bit of a chat,
333000	336000	but someone said something along the lines of
336000	339000	like, oh mummy's just so happy to play
339000	342000	and see us that it never comes out.
346000	349000	I feel very loved when we can do goofy things like this together.
349000	352000	Why is my eye out of alignment?
353000	356000	Oh you guys forget, it's 250,
356000	359000	it's 250 pieces too easy.
359000	363000	The next unlock is going to be my schedule for next week.
364000	367000	So you have to figure out what my schedule is.
368000	370000	Let me get really clear.
371000	373000	Yeah, you can see the goods.
376000	379000	I can't wait for the 10k stream.
379000	382000	Strony's bathtub, yeah, yeah, yeah, but
382000	384000	I'm done with the re-
384000	387000	message deleted by Strony's followers.
387000	390000	Family portrait, oh, oh dear.
391000	393000	Someone accidentally did it.
394000	397000	This is emi's hair, oh sorry.
400000	403000	We have a few issues, we have a few technical errors,
403000	405000	don't worry we're getting there in the end.
405000	407000	It's so efficient.
410000	413000	But yeah, the next one you're going to unlock,
413000	415000	I'm going to have to hide the screen,
415000	418000	because you're going to unlock my schedule for next week.
418000	421000	But should I make it 500 pieces?
423000	425000	I don't know.
428000	431000	It keeps moving the puzzle your mum's just like.
435000	437000	Okay I'll do 500 for my schedule
437000	440000	and then I will talk over what we're playing next week together.
443000	445000	Are doing next week.
446000	448000	Why is this music so emotional for no reason?
448000	451000	I just typed in copyright free Zelda.
453000	456000	Whoever's moving the puzzle please stop doing that.
456000	458000	You're making it a bit harder to complete
458000	461000	and we've got quite a few images to get through.
461000	463000	I have behind the scenes images
463000	466000	that have never seen the light of day before.
466000	469000	So I'm very excited to show that.
476000	479000	So I don't know what you guys are going to react to.
485000	488000	Use control to lock it in please gang.
488000	490000	What?
495000	497000	What and then release?
499000	500000	Why you did it?
500000	503000	Okay so this was just an easy one to get you started.
503000	505000	These are the emotes of eyes.
507000	509000	You guys have put in the worst thing.
509000	511000	I'm in the way of it.
511000	513000	I just made it nice and easy.
518000	520000	I can't join because I'm on phone.
520000	522000	I'm sorry.
522000	524000	It's just a casual stream snipe.
524000	526000	This isn't intense or anything.
526000	528000	We're literally sitting making puzzles.
528000	530000	Right let's replay.
530000	533000	What's the replay going to look like?
533000	536000	Okay so this is me when I load it in.
545000	547000	I'm not jumping away from us.
547000	549000	Oh that was so fast.
549000	553000	Okay I think you guys are going to need like 500 pieces.
553000	556000	Because that was far too easy for you.
556000	558000	I don't want to sit on chat.
558000	560000	Sorry I'm sitting on chat if I'm over here.
560000	561000	Sorry.
561000	562000	Excuse me.
562000	564000	Just coming through.
564000	566000	Okay you want a thousand pieces?
566000	568000	Oh I'm not sure about that.
568000	569000	Hold on.
569000	571000	I think I need to...
571000	572000	Oh no.
572000	574000	Do I need to do a new room every time?
577000	582000	I think I need to give a new room every time.
582000	584000	Room settings.
585000	586000	Oh dear.
592000	593000	Oh dear oh dear.
593000	595000	I think I need to create a new room darlings.
595000	597000	I'm so sorry.
603000	604000	Okay.
604000	607000	Next one is my schedule.
607000	610000	And we can do a thousand pieces?
611000	614000	Are you sure you want a thousand pieces?
617000	620000	I don't think we can because of the background on it.
620000	622000	I'm going to do 750 pieces.
622000	626000	Okay 700 pieces a schedule test.
626000	628000	I think...
628000	631000	Oh it's already just made the thing.
632000	635000	Oh this looks difficult.
635000	637000	I'm not sure.
637000	640000	50 pieces might be too much for us reeflings.
640000	641000	I know.
641000	643000	Look I'm really testing.
643000	648000	Pet pie says 750 pieces puzzle.
648000	652000	Puzzle and it's my schedule.
652000	654000	Rollie legend.
654000	659000	Thank you for becoming a member for over a month.
660000	663000	I was able to...
663000	665000	Did that work?
665000	667000	I swear if it does.
667000	669000	He's not.
672000	674000	This one's not the easiest.
674000	676000	I'll just make sure you guys are joining me.
676000	678000	Or did I link the wrong thing?
678000	681000	I think I linked the right thing.
684000	687000	Yeah this one's 750 pieces.
688000	690000	I'll wait until you guys are in in.
692000	694000	Or is it not working?
695000	698000	I don't see you guys able to join the list.
700000	704000	If we all work together it'll be fine.
704000	706000	I'm in?
706000	708000	That doesn't display anyone.
708000	710000	It just says me the big fish.
710000	712000	We're in?
714000	716000	Is mine broken?
718000	721000	Is it moving?
721000	723000	Is it moving for anyone?
726000	728000	We're dragging pieces.
728000	729000	Refresh?
729000	730000	Oh.
731000	732000	Huh.
737000	738000	Oh.
739000	740000	Oh are you in?
740000	741000	You're here.
741000	742000	Yay!
742000	744000	Okay good luck figuring out my thing.
744000	745000	I will give you a hint.
745000	749000	The ginger goes to the left of the schedule because that's what the photo is.
749000	754000	Any skin colour goes to the left because again that's what the photo is.
755000	757000	I don't know why they didn't like that.
760000	761000	God my joke wasn't seen.
761000	763000	I'm sorry wait what was your joke?
763000	764000	We're in let's go.
764000	766000	Oh wait hold on let me get out of the way of the chat.
766000	768000	I'm always in the way I think I'm gonna have to...
768000	770000	I can't believe it but I'm standing to the side.
770000	773000	Are you guys okay if I cover up chat a little bit?
774000	776000	We're in let's go.
776000	778000	End the stream straight up.
780000	781000	And it...
781000	783000	Well let's just see.
783000	784000	My pintas.
784000	785000	My saw.
785000	787000	That's actually really good.
787000	788000	Oh I wish that was the tail.
788000	789000	I don't know what the tail is.
789000	790000	Let's go.
790000	792000	This puzzle is long like a reflexant.
794000	796000	Oh why am I getting smaller?
796000	797000	Don't be shy.
799000	802000	Oh my god how have you put together an eye already?
802000	803000	That's insane.
804000	806000	You guys are too good at this.
806000	808000	Like unironically you guys are too good.
810000	812000	And then you get to figure...
812000	813000	Oh!
813000	816000	Not you guys already figuring out plop plop plop.
816000	818000	Is it in my schedule?
820000	822000	All I see is plop plop plop yeah.
823000	825000	Oh hold on I've not got live chat on.
825000	826000	It's horrible.
827000	829000	Quality mate viewers are discussing a game idea
829000	831000	where multiple people collaboratively solve
831000	833000	a very large jigsaw puzzle.
833000	836000	That is the most accurate one I've seen so far.
837000	838000	No?
838000	839000	Look how efficient you guys are.
839000	841000	Really color coding down here.
841000	843000	What color coordination of the purple?
843000	845000	The edge pieces?
845000	848000	Someone's going to absolutely ham on the edge pieces.
850000	852000	Of course that's the first discernible thing
852000	854000	that comes together.
854000	855000	Oh!
855000	857000	And more of the words are coming together.
859000	860000	What do you think it says?
860000	862000	It says get educated.
862000	863000	Get educated.
863000	865000	Plop plop plop.
867000	870000	Refling's the master of edge truly.
870000	872000	We live in a society.
873000	875000	I can see my belt coming together.
875000	877000	Am I supposed to be doing this with you guys?
877000	879000	Or am I allowed to like commentate
879000	881000	as if this is like a super MLG game?
881000	883000	And the reflings are coming in clutch.
883000	884000	We have the border of the south.
884000	886000	We have a border north and left.
886000	887000	Oh, okay.
887000	888000	Hold on a minute.
888000	890000	We've got a whole quadrant.
890000	892000	We have the shape over here.
892000	893000	And of course I'm covering it up.
893000	894000	I'll go in the middle.
894000	897000	As we can see to my right.
897000	898000	Well, it's my right.
898000	900000	Your left, I guess.
900000	901000	Look at me.
901000	902000	It's in there.
902000	903000	And we're getting...
903000	904000	It's all coming together.
904000	906000	There's like no good area to go.
907000	909000	Isn't that amazing?
910000	913000	I hate navigating.
913000	916000	I'll just be all the way down here.
916000	917000	Okay.
917000	918000	Thank you for all your hard work.
918000	919000	Refling.
924000	925000	Hi.
925000	926000	Hi, Johnny.
926000	927000	Hi, Refling.
928000	929000	Good morning.
929000	931000	We're playing a ridiculous game
931000	933000	where we put puzzles together.
933000	935000	But the reward for doing the puzzle,
935000	937000	you'll never guess what it is.
937000	940000	As you get to see what my schedule is.
943000	944000	For this week.
945000	947000	Oh, I see it.
947000	948000	I see one.
948000	950000	Epic Gamer, thank you for coming
950000	951000	to member and to support.
951000	952000	Oh, no.
952000	955000	My freaking stream elements isn't up.
955000	959000	So I can't see the history.
960000	962000	Oh, and I'm just really big.
963000	965000	It's one of those streams where things
965000	968000	aren't working the way they ought to be.
969000	970000	Thank you, Gamberly Legends.
970000	972000	I made the month membership today.
972000	973000	Congratulations.
973000	974000	Thank you.
974000	976000	And then Epic Gamer, thank you for coming to member.
976000	977000	I appreciate it.
977000	981000	All membership streams resume on the last week.
981000	983000	And I will make up for any missed streams.
983000	985000	I promise.
985000	987000	Oh, it's all coming together.
987000	988000	Oh, sorry.
989000	990000	Wait, how to...
991000	993000	Check it out.
994000	996000	You can see it coming together.
996000	997000	We've got weekly here.
997000	998000	Oh, someone had it.
998000	999000	It was like that.
1000000	1002000	I don't want to interfere too much.
1002000	1004000	I feel like I'm going to sabotage it.
1004000	1005000	Oh, no.
1006000	1007000	Oh, no.
1007000	1009000	Is this game what I think it is?
1010000	1012000	Is this game what I think it is?
1012000	1013000	Hold on a minute.
1013000	1014000	Oh, no.
1014000	1015000	Okay.
1015000	1016000	We've got the games together.
1016000	1018000	Oh, the games are coming together.
1020000	1022000	Oh, we've got get educated, get educated,
1022000	1023000	get educated, get educated.
1023000	1024000	Plop, plop, plop.
1025000	1027000	We've got a supermarket simulator.
1027000	1029000	What remains of Edith Finch?
1029000	1030000	That was a recommended game.
1030000	1032000	Are you squiddin' me right now?
1032000	1033000	Kent Quispy.
1033000	1036000	I'm blue, diva, diva, diva.
1036000	1038000	Wait, why'd I forget the tune of that?
1038000	1042000	I'm blue, abadi, abadi, and I'm blue.
1042000	1045000	I would die if I would beat off a guy.
1046000	1048000	Thank you for the membership extended.
1048000	1049000	I have no idea.
1049000	1051000	I still want to say
1051000	1052000	about that.
1052000	1054000	I'm like, yes, membership extended.
1054000	1055000	Oh, what do I see?
1055000	1058000	Ring for adventure with a heart rate monitor.
1061000	1064000	Well, I've got a collab with someone.
1064000	1066000	Who have I got a collab with?
1069000	1071000	Oh, I'm sorry, Refling.
1071000	1073000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, down here.
1073000	1075000	Yeah, yeah, chase each other.
1075000	1076000	Chase each other.
1076000	1077000	Yay, you did it.
1077000	1078000	You did it.
1079000	1081000	Thanks for subscribing again.
1081000	1083000	And subscriptions all over you.
1083000	1085000	If I were green, I would die.
1085000	1087000	If I were green, I would die.
1087000	1089000	Hey, Stony, we can see the finished puzzle
1089000	1091000	in the top left corner.
1095000	1096000	Oh, no.
1096000	1098000	No, don't cheat.
1098000	1100000	It's supposed to be a surprise.
1101000	1102000	Oh, no.
1103000	1106000	Oh, no, it's a cheat sheet at all.
1106000	1107000	Oh, no.
1109000	1112000	It's supposed to be a surprise.
1113000	1114000	No.
1115000	1117000	Wait, you guys hear the whole time?
1117000	1120000	You just let me be happy in my ignorance?
1120000	1122000	Okay, I'll be happy in my ignorance.
1123000	1125000	Like it's me.
1125000	1128000	And I'm going with my little heart pose.
1128000	1129000	I love that pose.
1129000	1132000	I might unironically ready to commission that pose.
1132000	1135000	Like with my hand forward and then the other one like...
1137000	1138000	Yeah.
1141000	1143000	The only problem is this bit here,
1143000	1145000	it gets impossible.
1145000	1148000	That's why I was worried about doing a thousand pieces.
1148000	1150000	Because in it, it's just darkness.
1150000	1153000	There's literally no logic to this section whatsoever.
1155000	1158000	I mean, the best I can do is like just try and force it.
1158000	1159000	Oh, sorry.
1159000	1161000	I don't know who that was, but sorry.
1162000	1164000	Wait, what, Mummy?
1164000	1166000	You will play Sukiya?
1167000	1168000	Maybe?
1169000	1171000	So every beat you were hit,
1171000	1173000	like remember when Sukiya came out
1173000	1175000	and everyone was going fucking...
1175000	1177000	Oh, oh, ah, ah, ape shit over it?
1178000	1180000	And I was like, you know what?
1180000	1182000	I want to see what the big deal is.
1182000	1184000	And apparently it's just a short and sweet game.
1184000	1186000	There's nothing too hard about it or nothing.
1186000	1188000	Whoa, Sukiya?
1188000	1189000	Isn't that Sukiya?
1190000	1191000	Suka?
1191000	1192000	Se'u?
1192000	1193000	Eka?
1194000	1195000	Um...
1196000	1197000	Mods...
1197000	1198000	Saw his...
1199000	1200000	Jiggle his soul.
1201000	1202000	Suika!
1204000	1205000	Se'u...
1205000	1206000	What did I say?
1206000	1207000	Se'u-kiya.
1207000	1208000	Sukiya.
1209000	1210000	Danlos by the Ring Fit...
1211000	1213000	The Ring Fit Adventure Squad record?
1213000	1215000	You know it, boo-boo!
1216000	1218000	I don't know what the endurance thing is, but...
1220000	1222000	Right, we do have a lot of...
1223000	1225000	No, this is where it gets difficult.
1225000	1226000	Right, we have a date.
1226000	1228000	We've got the 18th, so...
1229000	1231000	Uh, what's the day's date?
1232000	1233000	15...
1233000	1235000	So it'd be 16, 17, 18.
1236000	1237000	Um...
1240000	1241000	So...
1242000	1244000	Uh, oh no, it says Wednesday.
1244000	1247000	Okay, so we need to find Monday.
1248000	1249000	That's Tuesday.
1249000	1251000	Alright, we've got Monday here.
1252000	1255000	Um, so we can start with Monday and Tuesday,
1255000	1258000	and then we can start putting the games in the order...
1258000	1259000	that they...
1259000	1260000	start in.
1261000	1263000	I've got a date with Momaya, later, Virgin.
1263000	1265000	Are you holding on to a date?
1266000	1267000	No, you know.
1267000	1268000	No, there it is.
1268000	1269000	Look, it's on the move.
1269000	1271000	So Monday needs to go, like...
1271000	1272000	somewhere here.
1272000	1274000	I don't know where, but somewhere here.
1274000	1275000	Sorry, Strontium.
1275000	1277000	My pre-order can't handle the puzzle website,
1277000	1280000	so I can't play along without your stream lag and heavy.
1280000	1281000	I'll have to spectate.
1281000	1282000	I'm so sorry.
1282000	1283000	Aw, don't worry.
1283000	1285000	I'm sorry that, um...
1285000	1287000	I thought this would be a relatively easy one
1287000	1289000	to, like, stream snipe on.
1291000	1293000	But I know not all PCs are built equally.
1293000	1294000	That's okay.
1295000	1298000	Now this one, the time and then the dates
1298000	1300000	is gonna be a really hard section
1300000	1302000	because I always stream at the same time.
1303000	1305000	I'm not sure how easy it's gonna be.
1305000	1307000	I'm just trying to see if there's anything obvious.
1307000	1309000	Now there is a bit of pink text.
1309000	1310000	Ooh, sorry.
1310000	1312000	There is a bit of pink text.
1317000	1320000	Where do I need some sort of purple hue on this side?
1321000	1324000	Is there anything with a purple hue?
1324000	1325000	Oh, here!
1325000	1327000	This is the very piece I've been needing.
1327000	1328000	Ta-da!
1328000	1330000	I'm just so smart.
1330000	1331000	See, I helped!
1331000	1333000	I did one!
1334000	1336000	Turn off GPU rendering.
1337000	1338000	Stony please.
1338000	1339000	Suki again.
1339000	1341000	Call it Suika.
1341000	1343000	Suika.
1343000	1344000	Oh!
1345000	1346000	Aw.
1346000	1348000	You found it out now.
1349000	1351000	Drawing gen 2 suggestions.
1351000	1353000	I kept my word.
1354000	1355000	Oh no!
1358000	1360000	Did I just take my meds?
1360000	1361000	Hello?
1363000	1365000	Hello, reflings?
1367000	1369000	Did I just take my meds?
1372000	1374000	Oh no!
1375000	1376000	Hold on.
1377000	1379000	Did I need a refresh?
1380000	1381000	Refresh?
1381000	1382000	There's no refresh.
1382000	1383000	Oh no, we're back.
1383000	1384000	We're back.
1387000	1389000	I was like,
1390000	1392000	still there.
1392000	1393000	Okay, we weren't real.
1393000	1395000	No, don't say that.
1395000	1397000	I think it's sad enough in Elden Ring when we finished our boss
1397000	1400000	and then you guys despawned instantly.
1401000	1403000	A repopulation.
1403000	1405000	Whoa, did I just take my meds?
1407000	1409000	I don't take my meds for you.
1412000	1414000	Right, we've got Monday.
1414000	1416000	So Monday has to go.
1416000	1417000	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
1417000	1418000	Okay, I guess not.
1418000	1419000	Oh, there's a Wednesday.
1419000	1422000	Well, we can bring Wednesday under Tuesday.
1422000	1423000	Oh, sorry.
1423000	1424000	No?
1425000	1426000	I'm trying to help,
1426000	1428000	but I think I'm making a worse refling.
1428000	1430000	Right, where's Tuesday?
1430000	1432000	Tuesday's here.
1432000	1434000	I'm gonna bring...
1436000	1438000	I think the lag isn't helping.
1438000	1439000	Oh no, wait, what?
1439000	1441000	Where's Wednesday?
1441000	1443000	Where's Wednesday not just here?
1443000	1444000	I'm gonna go crazy.
1444000	1445000	Oh, there's Wednesday.
1446000	1447000	No?
1447000	1449000	No, there's more wait now.
1449000	1452000	There's Friday if I'm Friday.
1452000	1454000	I'm helping, I'm helping.
1454000	1457000	Right, where's the rest of Friday though?
1464000	1466000	He took my piece and left.
1466000	1468000	No, I'm here, I'm here.
1473000	1474000	Where's my thigh?
1474000	1475000	Look for a really...
1475000	1476000	Oh, there's Friday.
1476000	1477000	I found Friday.
1477000	1480000	Oh, so wait, someone's doing something down here with it.
1481000	1482000	Where's my thigh?
1482000	1484000	There's like a big chunk of my thigh missing.
1484000	1486000	I'm gonna go look for it.
1486000	1487000	Hold on.
1489000	1492000	Look for a really pale piece.
1493000	1494000	I don't see it.
1494000	1495000	Oh no.
1498000	1499000	I lost it.
1499000	1501000	Someone's holding on to my thigh piece.
1501000	1502000	I'm eating the thigh.
1502000	1504000	I'm sucking on it right now.
1507000	1508000	Right.
1508000	1510000	Hold on, what's going on here?
1511000	1515000	Oh, this is a bottom section of one of these.
1515000	1516000	I can see it.
1522000	1523000	Where is that thigh?
1523000	1525000	I genuinely can't find that thigh piece.
1527000	1529000	It would be so bright compared to all the others.
1531000	1532000	Eclan.
1538000	1539000	What?
1541000	1542000	Hold it.
1542000	1543000	Who's holding that in red?
1543000	1546000	You know I can kick whoever is trolling.
1550000	1553000	If you just trolling, I am going to kick you.
1553000	1554000	I'm not.
1554000	1555000	I'm not here for the troll.
1555000	1557000	I just want to have fun and play puzzle.
1558000	1559000	They chopped too hard.
1559000	1560000	It's not missing.
1560000	1562000	What, you guys saw it?
1562000	1563000	I can't see it.
1564000	1565000	Okay.
1565000	1566000	One second.
1566000	1569000	I don't know what it's going to come up with when I block someone.
1570000	1572000	Sorry, but please don't troll, darling.
1572000	1574000	We're just here to have fun.
1580000	1581000	I am blocked.
1581000	1584000	I will kick from games.
1584000	1585000	Please don't troll.
1585000	1587000	I'm just trying to have fun, goobers.
1589000	1592000	Oh, someone found the thigh piece.
1592000	1595000	Wow, look at my juicy thighs.
1595000	1596000	And look at this.
1596000	1598000	I've got like a little armpit here.
1598000	1603000	And I've got my eyes and my little shells.
1603000	1605000	And my little spikes here.
1605000	1606000	I love my little spikes.
1606000	1612000	I love my spikes that come like here because it's very, very cuttlefish-esque.
1612000	1615000	And then my little spikes here, which is also cuttlefish-esque.
1617000	1618000	Is it that?
1619000	1620000	Hmm.
1621000	1623000	Sorry, I think I keep accidentally moving it.
1623000	1624000	I'm not sure.
1628000	1630000	I see the shells.
1630000	1631000	I see all the-
1631000	1634000	It's going to be so hard to do these ones.
1634000	1638000	They're like impossible to decipher from one another.
1641000	1642000	I'm so sorry.
1642000	1644000	I just heard my dad blow his nose.
1644000	1646000	Sorry, I just heard my dad blow his nose.
1648000	1650000	He's not very well.
1651000	1653000	Mummy's left ball?
1653000	1655000	What are your names?
1655000	1657000	Stronny's armpit?
1661000	1662000	You guys are ridiculous.
1662000	1664000	Stronny's building?
1665000	1667000	Building what?
1667000	1670000	What am I making?
1671000	1673000	Building what?
1673000	1675000	It's my question.
1675000	1676000	Hi, everyone.
1676000	1677000	Hi, replay.
1677000	1679000	Good morning.
1681000	1683000	Oh, well, you guys are doing it.
1683000	1685000	You put together my schedule.
1689000	1694000	Yeah, these color pieces are going to be a bit more difficult.
1701000	1702000	Oh, I did it.
1702000	1703000	I helped a little bit.
1703000	1705000	Oh, hold on.
1706000	1709000	I'm just going to try it in all this space.
1709000	1711000	Oh, I just connected two pieces together.
1711000	1713000	Oh, I think I saw where it matched.
1713000	1714000	Yes.
1715000	1716000	We're doing it.
1716000	1718000	Reflings, we're doing it.
1718000	1723000	If we just force it, then it works.
1723000	1725000	It just works.
1725000	1730000	I know you shouldn't really force things in a tight small hole,
1730000	1733000	but yeah, I think it works.
1737000	1739000	Reflings strong together.
1739000	1742000	I'm excited to get slapped this week.
1742000	1746000	Best part of the art is the drawing being out, yeah.
1749000	1753000	Let's see what I was doing.
1753000	1755000	Maybe one up here.
1760000	1762000	Yeah, I ain't got that.
1762000	1765000	I don't have the reaction time to see who's doing that to ban them.
1769000	1773000	I feel like you guys are all getting frustrated with one another.
1773000	1775000	Mod's a precious man still.
1777000	1779000	Right, we do have like one...
1779000	1780000	Oh, no, I lost it.
1780000	1781000	Oh, I found it.
1783000	1785000	I was worried about that.
1786000	1787000	Oh, sorry.
1787000	1789000	I'm touching the same piece as someone else's.
1789000	1791000	Sorry, refling, I just...
1791000	1793000	Me and this refling just held hands.
1793000	1794000	Later.
1794000	1795000	Later.
1797000	1798000	Here?
1798000	1799000	No, not there.
1799000	1801000	Maybe that one?
1803000	1808000	I'm starting to feel that we might be getting frustrated at one another
1808000	1810000	and shaking the puzzle a little bit.
1810000	1812000	I'm just getting that slight indication.
1813000	1817000	I'm not sure if my theory is founded at all.
1819000	1821000	But I think, perhaps...
1823000	1825000	I've locked this thing seven times.
1826000	1828000	I can't focus.
1828000	1829000	Oh, my connection!
1829000	1830000	No!
1830000	1832000	My connection's gone again!
1832000	1836000	I think if you move around too much, it's killing the thingy.
1836000	1838000	Hydration checked.
1839000	1842000	We are so cool.
1842000	1844000	I mean, you can tell what I'm doing, right?
1844000	1846000	I think we know what we're doing.
1851000	1852000	What should I...
1852000	1855000	Maybe, wait, next time I'll make it, I'll see if I can like lock it or something.
1855000	1856000	I don't know.
1856000	1858000	Oh, no, my connection.
1859000	1861000	It's trying its best, refling.
1861000	1862000	Oh!
1863000	1864000	Oh, it's back.
1864000	1865000	Ta-da!
1866000	1868000	Oh, look out.
1868000	1870000	I'm helping, I'm helping.
1870000	1871000	Did you do it?
1871000	1872000	Oh, sorry.
1874000	1876000	Well, guys.
1876000	1877000	Yay!
1877000	1880000	It's my schedule for the week!
1880000	1882000	That's right, I put you to work for it.
1882000	1885000	When other VTubers hand it to you so willingly,
1885000	1889000	I raised your IQ levels by doing the puzzle.
1889000	1890000	Yatta!
1890000	1893000	Okay, so for next week's schedule,
1893000	1898000	I'm drawing your nasty Gen 2 suggestions.
1898000	1900000	I already know I'm going to get a slim girl.
1900000	1903000	I'm going to have to sit and actually develop her.
1903000	1907000	And we get to name them as well.
1907000	1910000	I asked Mercy.
1910000	1912000	I'm going to give her a sister.
1912000	1914000	I had five hours sleep,
1914000	1916000	but speaking of less sleep,
1916000	1918000	is her still awake, I think?
1918000	1919000	Hm.
1919000	1920000	Monk is.
1921000	1923000	Or maybe she's asleep, I don't know.
1923000	1926000	She might be asleep and it was an old message I read, but...
1927000	1933000	Yes, we are going to draw Gen 2 together.
1933000	1935000	I have to do your suggestions.
1935000	1936000	Mercy was very kind.
1936000	1937000	I asked her,
1937000	1939000	Oh no, we got kicked!
1940000	1942000	Okay, we got kicked, that's fine.
1943000	1944000	Scores!
1944000	1947000	Oh my God, let's see who does the most.
1948000	1951000	Hostrooms can't be kicked now.
1951000	1954000	Force anonymous restrictions, game mode.
1954000	1956000	How autistic are you?
1956000	1958000	Pieces will be neatly arranged,
1958000	1960000	appeasing the autists?
1964000	1966000	We got kicked, that's rude.
1966000	1968000	I think I did self destruct,
1968000	1970000	that's why I just in case.
1970000	1971000	Oh wait,
1971000	1974000	now I need to actually put up my schedule on screen
1974000	1977000	to talk about, hold on.
1977000	1980000	Wait, I need to put my schedule up one second,
1980000	1981000	I'm sorry.
1988000	1989000	One moment,
1989000	1991000	okay, I need to talk about my schedule.
1994000	1995000	Boom!
1995000	1997000	Oh, well, yeah.
1997000	1999000	It's a bit bigger than I was anticipating.
1999000	2001000	Okay, there we go.
2002000	2005000	This is my schedule for next week.
2005000	2006000	So yes,
2006000	2007000	tomorrow,
2007000	2011000	Mercy gave me the basis of what she used
2011000	2014000	on her alternative design and stuff.
2015000	2018000	And then the day after,
2018000	2022000	I am making a PowerPoint presentation
2022000	2024000	on my special interests,
2024000	2027000	and you're getting educated along the way.
2027000	2028000	Okay?
2028000	2029000	Yes,
2029000	2032000	I'm going to teach you things
2032000	2033000	and stuff that I like,
2033000	2035000	so you're being forced to get educated.
2039000	2041000	And then we're going to try Supermarket Simulator.
2041000	2044000	It seems like a small two hour game.
2045000	2048000	I'm going to watch Azura play it
2048000	2050000	because I don't know what the game is about.
2050000	2051000	I've never played it,
2051000	2053000	but I've seen a lot of Etubers play it.
2053000	2055000	If it's not short,
2055000	2058000	it might get substituted for this like road
2059000	2061000	game where you have to try and get the car
2061000	2063000	to go as long as possible.
2063000	2064000	But,
2064000	2065000	you're like,
2067000	2069000	Strongly Restrictions Disabled Image Preview,
2069000	2071000	so it's a surprise.
2071000	2073000	Yes, sir.
2074000	2076000	Okay.
2079000	2081000	It might be the long drive.
2081000	2083000	Yeah, I don't know if Supermarket Simulator
2083000	2085000	can kind of infinitely go on,
2085000	2087000	and I need to wrap it up.
2087000	2089000	I've got Ring Fit Adventure
2089000	2090000	with my heart rate monitor.
2090000	2092000	My heart rate monitor is here.
2092000	2094000	So I wanted to give it a shot.
2094000	2097000	See how I do in my fitness levels.
2098000	2100000	Probably shite, let's be honest.
2100000	2102000	And then we're playing
2105000	2107000	If that's how you guys want me to pronounce it.
2108000	2110000	Oh, Supermarket Sim can be easy endurance.
2113000	2115000	A lot of clapping in that stream.
2115000	2118000	I mean, if you want it to be, yes.
2122000	2125000	Oh, it's an infinite game, Supermarket Simulator.
2128000	2130000	You won't overdo it on this time on Ring Fit.
2130000	2132000	No, it's like two hours and done,
2132000	2134000	maybe even an hour and done.
2134000	2136000	Like, I don't want to be too loud for my dad.
2136000	2138000	He really does not feel well right now.
2138000	2140000	After stream, I'm going to check on him,
2140000	2142000	and I think I'm making him food.
2142000	2144000	I don't know if I'm about to do the old chicken soup.
2145000	2147000	Chicken noodle soup for him, I don't know.
2150000	2153000	But we're playing Ring Fit for two hours,
2153000	2155000	and then the next thing we're playing,
2155000	2157000	I'm not going to say it right, ever.
2157000	2159000	It says,
2159000	2161000	for two hours,
2163000	2165000	and then I'm going to go offline for a little bit,
2165000	2168000	and then at Azura's usual stream time,
2168000	2171000	me and Azura are going to play We Were Here.
2172000	2175000	It's like a free puzzle game,
2175000	2179000	so I'll be curious to see if we can get through it or not.
2182000	2185000	I have played it once before,
2185000	2189000	but I don't really remember too much of the details.
2191000	2193000	Wow, thank you for becoming a member.
2194000	2197000	Like, Lux, you get me educated, get me educated,
2197000	2199000	get me educated, blah blah blah.
2200000	2202000	Yeah.
2203000	2205000	The goats.
2205000	2207000	Suica.
2207000	2209000	Suica.
2213000	2216000	Then the stream snipe game is Mario Kart 8.
2216000	2217000	Now, before you're like,
2217000	2220000	oh, I can't wait to ruin you in the video game.
2220000	2224000	I promise you, I have absolutely nothing to offer in the video game.
2224000	2225000	You will win.
2225000	2228000	I will be pleading with you to wait at the finish line.
2228000	2231000	Fiendish, thank you for the extended membership.
2231000	2233000	Mummy up...
2233000	2236000	Mummy Square 2? Up 2?
2236000	2238000	Mummy Up 2.
2238000	2241000	What does that mean, Mummy Up 2? What are you up to?
2241000	2243000	But Mario Kart is a stream game,
2243000	2245000	and I picked it on a weekend.
2245000	2248000	I was very dumb and didn't pick a weekend
2248000	2251000	for the Jelly Bean game,
2251000	2253000	but we do it on weekends.
2253000	2257000	Mario Kart's subspace game, then no!
2257000	2259000	Stop the press!
2259000	2261000	Oh, God, we got a score.
2261000	2263000	The Sunday Driver, honestly.
2263000	2264000	My dad's asking me.
2264000	2266000	He's like, are you going to learn to drive?
2266000	2268000	I'm like, no, I like my bike.
2268000	2271000	And then a game that was recommended to me by you,
2271000	2275000	The Reeflings, is What Remains of Edith Finch.
2275000	2277000	Apparently, it's like,
2277000	2281000	super-sure two-hour game type thing.
2281000	2285000	So everything is planned for two hours this week,
2285000	2290000	except for the We Were Here collab,
2290000	2293000	because that's like a go-off,
2293000	2295000	and then a comeback on again.
2295000	2296000	Didn't Amy play that?
2296000	2300000	I couldn't tell you if she played Edith Finch.
2300000	2302000	I'm not sure.
2302000	2307000	Okay, let me get rid of the schedule.
2307000	2311000	And then let me do the next puzzle.
2311000	2314000	What do I make you do?
2314000	2319000	Would you rather Strony and Mercy, AC or Amy,
2319000	2322000	or, wait, sorry, Strony and Mercy,
2322000	2326000	or AC and me, or Azur and Sheeby.
2326000	2329000	What would you prefer for this forbidden artwork
2329000	2331000	that has never seen the late a day?
2331000	2334000	Strony and Mercy, okay.
2334000	2335000	I can't believe it.
2335000	2338000	Okay, Strony and Mercy.
2338000	2343000	I'll do 450 pieces, I think.
2343000	2355000	I think this is what I was supposed to do.
2355000	2358000	Now, I have hidden the artwork.
2358000	2359000	So before you're like,
2359000	2361000	oh, I don't know what it is.
2361000	2365000	You ain't supposed to.
2365000	2370000	You're not supposed to know what the artwork is.
2370000	2373000	So it's an actual challenge.
2373000	2377000	And I thought you were going to be a challenge.
2377000	2380000	Good luck.
2380000	2383000	So there isn't a background,
2383000	2388000	so I had to add a green and purple hue into the background
2388000	2393000	to make it even more challenging for you.
2393000	2396000	Now, I don't think any of these artworks were posted.
2396000	2399000	As far as I'm aware, they've not been posted.
2399000	2401000	For one reason or another,
2401000	2403000	we'll not go around to it.
2403000	2406000	It's not really been a moment to annoy each other with it.
2406000	2409000	I must go stay strong for the plot-plot-plot roofling.
2409000	2411000	Oh, thank you for hanging.
2411000	2413000	Please don't worry.
2413000	2416000	Is there an option for two pieces only?
2416000	2419000	A wee bit of a cheat sheet at all.
2419000	2422000	Take the edge pieces to the respective edges.
2422000	2425000	Oh, we've got the tactics coming in.
2425000	2427000	There is no way.
2427000	2431000	You already have a corner of green.
2431000	2433000	That's insane.
2436000	2439000	I think they've already figured out that I'm on the left side.
2439000	2442000	I don't know. I'm getting the indication the rooflings have figured out
2442000	2445000	I'm on the left side. I repeat.
2445000	2448000	I'm a professional edging. Don't worry.
2448000	2451000	Oh yeah, it's edging time.
2451000	2453000	Well, you post the artwork there.
2453000	2456000	Of course, I'll maybe get Mercy to post it
2456000	2459000	so she can get the Twitter interactions for it.
2459000	2462000	Because I'm not fussed for Twitter.
2462000	2464000	Honestly, on Twitter, I'm like,
2464000	2468000	I'm making prego ASMR. Here's the picture.
2468000	2472000	And then like, oh my god, thank you for 10,000 subscribers.
2472000	2475000	We got in a debut highlight
2475000	2479000	from a previously established clip channel.
2479000	2483000	And oh my god, everyone's blown ahead in subscribers.
2483000	2486000	I actually do have good news about anyone who does clipping
2486000	2488000	and has an established channel.
2488000	2492000	We, on August 1st, the Allure
2492000	2494000	are going to...
2494000	2496000	the Allure.
2496000	2497000	Alluring.
2497000	2500000	Are going to release a clipping program
2500000	2502000	where you get paid for posting clips
2502000	2506000	if it, you know, like $1 per 1000 views type thing.
2507000	2510000	Oh my god, why is it so tiny?
2510000	2512000	Hold on.
2512000	2514000	Is that the bottom of it already?
2514000	2517000	Well, you can kind of see Mercy and me coming together, huh?
2520000	2522000	It was such a well put together cut.
2522000	2523000	Did you see it?
2523000	2526000	It literally propelled us ahead so much.
2526000	2527000	And I'm so thankful.
2527000	2529000	So I'm very ha...
2529000	2533000	Oh my god, the puzzle's tiny compared to how many pieces are on the damn thing.
2533000	2534000	Hmm.
2534000	2537000	Maybe I've made this too easy?
2538000	2541000	I mean, you can see me here.
2542000	2545000	Excuse me, you're doing what together?
2545000	2547000	I don't know, you're going to have to do the puzzle.
2547000	2550000	You're going to have to do the puzzle to figure out what we're doing.
2554000	2556000	But yes, thank you for $10,000.
2556000	2559000	I'm very excited to see how the ASMR stream's going to go.
2559000	2561000	I feel like I'm going to, like, rub the bathtub
2561000	2562000	and everyone's going to be like,
2562000	2563000	oh, my ears!
2563000	2566000	And I'll be like, yep, that's kind of what happens when you're in a bathtub.
2569000	2572000	Could you imagine it's an alternative puzzle?
2572000	2575000	As much as I would adore to do that?
2575000	2576000	No.
2579000	2581000	Oh, look at me!
2581000	2582000	Hi, me.
2582000	2586000	Oh, you can see one of my side details and stuff.
2586000	2588000	Oh, there's my abdomen.
2589000	2591000	I can see Mercy's belt here.
2591000	2594000	This is like Mercy's belt.
2594000	2597000	Oh, my God, Mercy has a belt, yes.
2597000	2601000	I know you're normally looking at her bowl area.
2601000	2604000	Oh, look, see, this is Mercy's collar here.
2604000	2607000	They do such a casual thing.
2607000	2610000	They are holding hands!
2610000	2612000	I showed that video with the clips on my friends
2612000	2614000	and he subscribed all together.
2614000	2618000	Literally, when we finished the AC collab,
2618000	2622000	she hit 6,000 subscribers.
2622000	2625000	And I think, like, she's blown past that.
2625000	2627000	I mean, I celebrated 10k.
2627000	2629000	It says I'm at 10.7.
2629000	2631000	I'm like, oh, my God, the ASMR debt increases.
2631000	2633000	I'm like, hmm.
2634000	2636000	I think the scoring might be skewed
2636000	2639000	because the points are going to the slotted thingy.
2639000	2641000	Oh, yeah.
2642000	2644000	Okay, see, Mercy's...
2644000	2647000	Oh, I apologize for y'all, I'm high.
2647000	2649000	I got five hours of sleep today,
2649000	2650000	but I'm going back to...
2650000	2652000	I'm going back to bed.
2652000	2654000	Oh, no, I've got the Yumi watch along.
2654000	2657000	Yumi plus have a concert today.
2657000	2660000	I could maybe get a nap before it.
2660000	2664000	I mean, what happens if I had a nap on you, Refland?
2664000	2667000	You're just so hot and warm to lie on.
2667000	2670000	And then you pet my hair and I fall asleep
2670000	2672000	and then you can violently wake me up
2672000	2675000	for the Yumi plus concert watch along.
2677000	2679000	I think that would do quite...
2679000	2680000	Oh, what are me and...
2680000	2681000	Oh, what's going on?
2681000	2684000	Me and Mercy, what's going on here?
2684000	2686000	Hmm.
2686000	2689000	There's a finger being pointed at Mercy.
2689000	2692000	Wait a minute, there's a finger being pointed at me.
2692000	2695000	What is this artwork all about?
2695000	2696000	A concert of what?
2696000	2697000	Is it heavy metal?
2697000	2699000	I don't think they've done heavy metal.
2699000	2701000	I don't know what they've done.
2701000	2704000	But...
2704000	2706000	That's a cosy tube.
2706000	2710000	Is cosy tube fucking stream sniping right now?
2710000	2713000	Is someone ERPing is cosy tube?
2713000	2714000	Be honest right now.
2714000	2716000	What?
2716000	2717000	Key signal.
2717000	2720000	Thank you for the 50 gifted memberships.
2720000	2723000	What the heck?
2723000	2724000	Are you serious?
2724000	2728000	We're playing a puzzle game.
2728000	2730000	Thank you for the 50 bomb.
2730000	2732000	Holy moly!
2732000	2733000	What?
2733000	2734000	Thank you.
2734000	2737000	Congrats to those who caught it with your face.
2737000	2739000	Thank you for the 50 bomb.
2739000	2742000	Big massive balls doesn't say anything.
2742000	2746000	Key signal, absolute Chad.
2746000	2747000	Thank you.
2747000	2749000	Congrats to those who got it.
2749000	2751000	Have you seen the Shibi stream?
2751000	2754000	I saw the start where they read the first script
2754000	2758000	to say that the script master got an absolute bollocking
2758000	2762000	as an understatement.
2762000	2766000	Yeah, he got an absolute bollocking.
2766000	2775000	Don't get me wrong, it was funny and it made good, hilarious clips.
2775000	2784000	But I paid, you know, substantial money.
2784000	2789000	I don't, yeah, so don't worry, don't worry.
2789000	2790000	Glorps your giggles.
2790000	2792000	No, don't start it off again.
2792000	2793000	I don't even want to know.
2793000	2798000	I listened to Emi and Shibi do it, like,
2798000	2799000	and then it's the thing.
2799000	2801000	Oh, Stronys chair.
2801000	2802000	That was so good.
2802000	2803000	Mummy's left ball.
2803000	2804000	I don't.
2804000	2806000	Stronys gaggle stick.
2806000	2807000	Are you serious?
2807000	2808000	I just read that.
2808000	2811000	No.
2811000	2812000	Oh my God.
2812000	2815000	Congrats on everyone who's catching the membership, by the way.
2815000	2816000	You have emotes.
2816000	2818000	The more emotes are coming.
2818000	2822000	I repeat, more emotes are coming.
2822000	2827000	Shibi, I had to go on her account and Shibi has, like,
2827000	2829000	20 missing emotes slots right now.
2829000	2832000	She's got so many emotes she can commission.
2832000	2834000	Hi.
2834000	2835000	Hi.
2835000	2836000	Thank you for joining.
2836000	2837000	We're playing a puzzle game.
2837000	2840000	If you click the link below, not only do I get your IP address
2840000	2842000	so I can come to your house late at night
2842000	2844000	when I need to take my frustrations out on you
2844000	2846000	after losing Valtro,
2846000	2852000	but you guys have done it.
2852000	2856000	What do your elf eyes see, little reeflings?
2856000	2857000	Real.
2857000	2858000	No.
2858000	2861000	Okay, you may just get access to the puzzle game.
2861000	2865000	Oh, sorry.
2865000	2866000	Wait a minute.
2866000	2869000	Why are me and Mercy fighting?
2869000	2871000	Do you want to know why we're fighting?
2871000	2874000	Because I want to kill you because I'm a siren
2874000	2877000	and she wants to kill you because she's a yandere
2877000	2880000	and we're both fighting over who gets to kill you.
2880000	2884000	That's why I commissioned this artwork.
2884000	2891000	Because we're fighting over who gets to kill you.
2891000	2892000	I'm not even kidding.
2892000	2896000	That's the context of why I commissioned this.
2896000	2898000	I'm like, no, I want to drown him.
2898000	2900000	And she's like, no, I'm a yandere.
2900000	2904000	I have the right to perish him.
2904000	2905000	Oh, my God.
2905000	2907000	So that is that one.
2907000	2908000	Did you like it?
2908000	2909000	It's us together.
2909000	2912000	This was very early access.
2912000	2918000	Before we had nail polish and bandaid designs and such.
2918000	2921000	But yeah, no, no, no, it's true.
2921000	2922000	That's true.
2922000	2926000	Very kawaii ne.
2926000	2927000	Reconnecting.
2927000	2928000	Okay.
2928000	2929000	Next one.
2929000	2930000	You're not allowed.
2930000	2931000	No peeking.
2931000	2932000	No peeking.
2932000	2933000	Right.
2933000	2938000	You can have AC and Emmy or you can have Azura and Chibi.
2938000	2941000	What's your choice, darlings?
2941000	2943000	Do not giggle sticker puzzle thing.
2943000	2944000	Honestly.
2944000	2946000	Kawaii Disney or something.
2946000	2947000	Yes, exactly.
2947000	2948000	Kawaii Disney.
2948000	2951000	Thank you again for the 50 gifted memberships.
2951000	2955000	That was an incredibly kind key signal.
2955000	2959000	You absolute Chad comes in, gives memberships, doesn't say a thing, walks away.
2959000	2961000	You want to do who...
2961000	2963000	Oh, you guys are actually split.
2963000	2965000	Oh, but I've got Azura.
2965000	2966000	Okay, okay, okay.
2966000	2968000	No.
2968000	2970000	You guys are going to like this one.
2970000	2972000	I'll do 450 because I don't want to...
2972000	2975000	I don't want to take up all your room, you know,
2975000	2977000	blaze it and all that jazz.
2977000	2980000	I don't want to take up too much of your time.
2980000	2981000	Because we've actually...
2981000	2983000	It's already been an hour and we've done two puzzles.
2983000	2984000	Wait.
2984000	2987000	Have we only done two puzzles?
2987000	2989000	Are you squidding me right now?
2989000	2992000	Bubba the Great, thank you for the extended membership.
2992000	2993000	We survived the first month.
2993000	2994000	Let's go.
2994000	2995000	Yay.
2995000	2997000	Thank you.
2997000	3000000	Okay, new puzzle, puzzle time.
3000000	3001000	Boom.
3001000	3004000	Boom, boom, boom, boom.
3004000	3006000	I want to double boom.
3006000	3007000	And you come.
3007000	3008000	And you come.
3008000	3012000	So this is a sheebie and Azura artwork together.
3012000	3015000	The preview has been disabled.
3015000	3020000	So please have fun with what happens next.
3020000	3022000	Oh my God, look at you go...
3022000	3023000	Oh my God.
3023000	3025000	Actually, can I say something really weird?
3025000	3028000	I really like watching ant videos.
3028000	3030000	You know those people that have ant videos
3030000	3032000	and show the colonies going to work
3032000	3034000	and how well in that they do?
3034000	3036000	I think it's really fascinating.
3036000	3038000	And I really enjoy it.
3038000	3040000	And I'm kind of getting those vibes.
3040000	3042000	Oh my God, you guys are doing really well.
3042000	3048000	I wanted for my doughnathon to maybe have an ant habitarium.
3048000	3050000	But I don't think I can do it.
3050000	3054000	Let's start edging, bros.
3054000	3057000	Ant eater girl for Gen 2.
3057000	3063000	Well, tomorrow is when I do all my goofy Gen 2 streams, okay?
3063000	3066000	If you guys want to continue to do puzzles
3066000	3068000	after my planned ones are done,
3068000	3072000	I can do the thumbnails if you want.
3072000	3074000	They're not the most exciting thumbnails.
3074000	3076000	Can't win them all.
3078000	3080000	Also, hey, I just got here.
3080000	3081000	Hi, hi.
3081000	3082000	Don't worry, don't worry.
3083000	3085000	We're just ants.
3085000	3087000	No, reflings, that's not what I meant.
3087000	3091000	I mean, just look how efficient you are.
3091000	3095000	This is actually really pleasing to my brain to watch.
3095000	3098000	Literally, they're so well coordinated.
3098000	3100000	It's proof that you share a brain.
3100000	3104000	Oh, we've got Azura in Shibi's face.
3104000	3108000	I was going to say, I'm going to give you a hint.
3108000	3111000	Azura is on the, I've colored, the background is colored
3111000	3112000	to what their color is.
3112000	3116000	So yeah, Shibi's on the red and Azura's on the purple.
3116000	3117000	Purples.
3119000	3121000	I like the taffy sounds a lot.
3126000	3129000	I have to go for now, but I'll try and come back later for now.
3129000	3130000	Bye bye.
3130000	3131000	Thank you for hanging.
3131000	3132000	Please don't worry.
3134000	3137000	I can't believe she hates us and wants to be a parent.
3137000	3138000	Oh, it's my lore.
3138000	3140000	You forgot my lore.
3140000	3144000	I want to end all of humanity via hypnosis.
3144000	3149000	No, that's me who has yet to freaking upload a serious hypnosis video, bruh.
3149000	3151000	I need to do it.
3151000	3156000	I'm not beating the accusations of how rubbish a hypnosis is,
3156000	3159000	but I said, like, when my dad goes home,
3159000	3164000	I am going to be glued to that recording booth.
3164000	3165000	I'm not even kidding.
3165000	3168000	I have so much to catch up on.
3168000	3170000	I have so many...
3170000	3172000	Sorry, I'm just putting this back to the start.
3172000	3176000	I have so many ASMR collabs to finalize
3176000	3179000	because I do not want to accept any more.
3179000	3182000	Oh, it's coming together.
3182000	3186000	But what is Azura and Shibi doing?
3186000	3189000	What are they doing in this picture?
3189000	3193000	I just remembered the hypnosis in the bagpipe short, honestly.
3193000	3197000	We're going to be under a spell.
3197000	3200000	It's inevitable.
3200000	3202000	They're hugging something.
3202000	3204000	What are they hugging?
3204000	3208000	What are they hugging?
3208000	3210000	They're going to figure it out.
3210000	3212000	Who knows?
3212000	3215000	The reeflings are working hard and diligently.
3215000	3218000	Well, I just realized how awkward it is to do Shibi's hair in a puzzle
3218000	3222000	because it's just like the wippy lanes.
3222000	3228000	The look they're giving me making my jiggle song.
3228000	3230000	Shibi, you're done.
3230000	3233000	I'm not reading any more of that.
3233000	3235000	Whoopsies.
3235000	3237000	I mean, you guys are getting there.
3237000	3241000	I think you're going to be able to figure out what happens next.
3241000	3243000	You're getting close.
3243000	3245000	Now, to give you a help in the background,
3245000	3247000	the Veiler logo is in the background.
3247000	3249000	Just to give you a helping hand.
3249000	3251000	So there's a text in the background that says Veiler,
3251000	3253000	just to make it a bit easier.
3253000	3256000	It is, yes, copyright free Zelda music.
3256000	3259000	How dare you identify my peaceful.
3259000	3261000	My peaceful.
3261000	3262000	Oh, it's stalled.
3262000	3263000	I don't know why.
3263000	3264000	Oh, there we go.
3264000	3265000	That was strange.
3265000	3266000	I don't know why that broke.
3266000	3267000	Okay, it's back.
3267000	3268000	I'm sorry.
3268000	3269000	I'm sorry.
3269000	3270000	Your peaceful music is back.
3270000	3271000	I apologize.
3271000	3273000	She thinks she still needs to spell it and chance me.
3273000	3275000	Oh.
3275000	3278000	Is it supposed to be us?
3278000	3279000	I don't know.
3279000	3283000	I don't have to come on in and help the puzzle.
3283000	3286000	I see a lot of blue for his hair.
3286000	3287000	Yes.
3287000	3288000	When feet.
3288000	3291000	I didn't have a feet picture in mind.
3291000	3295000	I was going to show a heavily censored artwork I got on myself,
3295000	3297000	but it was pretty outrageous.
3297000	3298000	I have to admit.
3298000	3301000	There's three brief ones were jumping me.
3301000	3303000	Let's just say that's what the artwork was.
3303000	3308000	They were jumping me.
3308000	3311000	Both their hair is a puzzle on their own.
3311000	3312000	Honestly.
3312000	3315000	So when are you going to release puzzles?
3315000	3318000	Oh, you went like an actual physical puzzle.
3318000	3323000	Honestly, a micro puzzle would be adorable.
3323000	3324000	I don't care what anyone says.
3324000	3327000	I think a micro puzzle would be adorable.
3327000	3329000	Jumping you affectionately.
3329000	3330000	Yes.
3330000	3332000	Very affectionately.
3332000	3337000	Very, very, very engaging, if you will.
3337000	3339000	A word by that marriage.
3339000	3341000	I think it would be cute.
3341000	3346000	Maybe I can order custom puzzles and be like, hey, I have like 100.
3346000	3353000	I mean, you guys are getting there.
3353000	3354000	You're getting very close.
3354000	3359000	Now, a remainder that Azura has weight on her ears.
3359000	3360000	She has gooped ears.
3360000	3364000	So maybe that's a bit of a hinge.
3364000	3371000	As always, Madame has her lovely suit.
3371000	3374000	Throughout Heaven and Earth, we are the jumping ones.
3374000	3378000	The reeflings are me, myself and I.
3378000	3380000	I cannot wait to write that pregnancy script.
3380000	3382000	It's going to be the most wild thing.
3382000	3384000	And before I get so passionate about it,
3384000	3387000	it's like a one hour long like sleep aid audio,
3387000	3390000	but like I talk for the first 30 minutes.
3390000	3393000	And then like we have a nap together whilst you're in my tummy.
3393000	3396000	I can just see me getting so passionate when I write about it.
3396000	3397000	I'm not even kidding.
3397000	3401000	I'm so happy I get to fucking make pregnant with you ASMR.
3401000	3404000	Like, ah, this is exactly what I want to do.
3404000	3405000	I don't want to be serious.
3405000	3407000	I don't want to be trihard.
3407000	3409000	Double heartbeat ASMR.
3409000	3411000	Boom, boom.
3411000	3416000	A bit too affectionate maybe.
3416000	3419000	Hydration check reeflings.
3419000	3421000	I'm having to drink water.
3421000	3422000	No tea.
3422000	3425000	I'm having no tea today because I need to...
3425000	3426000	Oh!
3426000	3428000	Oh, reeflings.
3428000	3430000	What do you see?
3432000	3435000	We're getting edged with the last piece.
3435000	3442000	Any Azura and Shibi fans?
3442000	3445000	Is that you?
3445000	3447000	Be honest, reeflings.
3447000	3451000	Is that you in the middle and enjoying the embrace?
3451000	3455000	The big embraces?
3455000	3457000	Yeah?
3457000	3459000	Yeah, you enjoying the embrace?
3459000	3461000	I'm glad.
3461000	3463000	That's me.
3463000	3465000	Hmm.
3465000	3467000	Where's Azura's hand reaching to?
3467000	3469000	You don't worry about that part.
3469000	3470000	Okay, that part comes later.
3470000	3472000	I'm being hugged by the wrong woman.
3472000	3475000	The outline makes me think it's throwing me.
3476000	3478000	Hmm.
3478000	3480000	Four big personalities collide.
3480000	3483000	Being spoiled by Madam and Mama is the best.
3483000	3485000	Yeah.
3485000	3488000	Okay, now last but certainly not least.
3488000	3494000	Once this expired is a Emmy and AC together.
3494000	3496000	Being so adorable.
3496000	3502000	Let me just hide my screen so you guys don't get any spoilers to what's ahead.
3502000	3504000	But here is AC and Emmons.
3504000	3507000	Again, we'll just do 450 please.
3507000	3509000	Because it's a good...
3509000	3512000	Or I think it's a good number.
3512000	3514000	It's not too difficult.
3514000	3516000	It didn't take too long.
3516000	3519000	And the room can be found.
3519000	3522000	Pe-A-Z-Z-L-A.
3522000	3524000	Ta-da!
3533000	3536000	Now this is a Emmy and AC.
3536000	3539000	So orange and blue.
3539000	3541000	Yeah.
3542000	3544000	Let's get...
3544000	3546000	On your marks.
3546000	3548000	Get set.
3552000	3554000	Spoiler, there's a screen.
3557000	3560000	I must unfortunately decline the offer of that embrace.
3560000	3563000	You can be hugged by any member of your luring.
3568000	3569000	Cheeky young.
3569000	3574000	Okay, I think I might be really cheeky and after the stream go for a nap before the Yumi Plus stream.
3574000	3575000	Is that bad of me?
3575000	3576000	Is that naughty?
3576000	3578000	I think it is naughty.
3579000	3582000	I'm a sleepy baby.
3582000	3584000	I got five hours.
3584000	3585000	Orange and blue.
3585000	3586000	Florida colours.
3586000	3589000	No, movie poster colours.
3589000	3595000	Remember that post that broke down that all movie posters are blue and orange hue?
3596000	3598000	It's only not if you don't wake up in time.
3598000	3600000	We gotta quickly fin...
3600000	3602000	We gotta finish quickly to get her rims.
3602000	3604000	Oh no, don't worry about it like that.
3604000	3606000	It's not like that.
3606000	3608000	Oh, I see Emmy.
3608000	3610000	Emmy's being made.
3614000	3615000	But where's AC's face?
3615000	3617000	I don't see AC.
3617000	3618000	Oh, there she is.
3618000	3620000	She's starting to form over here.
3620000	3622000	You guys are doing it.
3627000	3629000	Okay, we've got a border on AC's side.
3629000	3631000	It's coming over.
3631000	3635000	I'm just gonna plop it down there, but Emmy is thoroughly...
3635000	3638000	Well, I can see AC's cold in here.
3638000	3640000	Is that AC's belt, maybe?
3640000	3641000	Oh, I see Emmy's belt.
3641000	3643000	See, Emmy has a belt like this.
3643000	3645000	This is the wee piece here.
3646000	3648000	Oh god, I misunderstood me.
3648000	3650000	Said Emmy's being made.
3650000	3652000	No, I have to...
3652000	3654000	That's an ASMR booth.
3654000	3659000	No, in theory, the girls were conceptualised...
3662000	3664000	with us all together.
3665000	3667000	No, you'll be full of energy.
3667000	3671000	So you can cheer as loud and proud for Yume Plus, honestly.
3671000	3673000	I'm so excited to see there.
3673000	3676000	Me asking them for notes like, hey, how did you do this?
3676000	3679000	By the way, not asking for no particular reason.
3679000	3681000	Like, hey, what did it cost?
3681000	3683000	How did you do it?
3683000	3685000	I just need to know so I can do it for my girls.
3685000	3688000	That'd be great if you can give me some insider knowledge.
3688000	3690000	I'd appreciate it.
3690000	3692000	Okay, what's going on?
3692000	3694000	Emmy, Emmy's coming together.
3696000	3698000	I see Emmy's tummy.
3699000	3701000	And she's got her hands together.
3703000	3706000	I know what's happening here, but I can see...
3706000	3710000	Oh, look at the smugness on AC.
3710000	3712000	What's going on here?
3712000	3714000	Veiler concert win?
3714000	3716000	I don't know, it depends.
3718000	3720000	But look at the...
3720000	3722000	Emmy's brought to tears.
3722000	3724000	Why would my daughter...
3724000	3727000	Why would my darling daughter be brought to tears?
3727000	3729000	What is going on in this image?
3729000	3731000	What is going on in this image?
3732000	3734000	Emmy with brown hair?
3734000	3736000	No, she's ginger, I promise you.
3736000	3737000	She's ginger.
3737000	3739000	I was so confused why she thought she was blonde.
3739000	3742000	I'm like, in what universe, my damn?
3742000	3745000	You are not blonde, my dearest.
3745000	3747000	AC stealing her big bro?
3747000	3749000	No.
3750000	3752000	But you're putting the image together.
3752000	3754000	I think you'll be able to tell shortly.
3756000	3758000	I think you'll be able to tell shortly.
3758000	3761000	What do you mean again, AC's big bro?
3763000	3765000	Emmy fake cries all the time, I'm not filled.
3765000	3767000	She's probably on his pack.
3767000	3769000	She still insists she's dirty blonde.
3769000	3771000	She's ginger.
3774000	3777000	If she wants to say she's dirty blonde, I'm not arguing.
3777000	3780000	As long as she's happy, I'm happy.
3780000	3784000	But the concept is that she's a ginger.
3784000	3787000	She's in denial, that's what she is.
3790000	3792000	Someone just guessed it.
3793000	3796000	AC being taller.
3796000	3798000	So if you didn't know,
3799000	3803000	Emmy is 140 centimetres.
3803000	3807000	But AC is 142 centimetres.
3807000	3810000	So what is this artwork portraying?
3810000	3811000	Hi, Elf.
3811000	3814000	Elf Jeff, what kind of profile picture is that?
3814000	3818000	Is that Doctor House is like a telly tubby?
3818000	3821000	What is your profile picture?
3821000	3824000	Elf Jeff, thank you for becoming a member.
3824000	3827000	But oh my god, is that Doctor House
3827000	3830000	is a telly tubby?
3830000	3834000	Yeah, oh my god, that was off.
3834000	3836000	Emmy Burley, no.
3836000	3839000	Emmy's not the Burley in this one.
3839000	3841000	This is very...
3843000	3845000	Thank you for becoming a member, I do appreciate that though.
3845000	3848000	Thank you for the support.
3848000	3850000	Hugh, Larry as Tinky Winky.
3850000	3852000	House, I get.
3852000	3854000	But I don't see the telly tubby.
3854000	3856000	That means they don't look...
3856000	3859000	Do not look like Tinky Winky nor Dipsy.
3859000	3863000	What if it's AC with heels?
3863000	3866000	I don't know, I think AC is taller.
3866000	3867000	What's this?
3867000	3870000	I was gonna say, I recognise this.
3870000	3873000	Right, this is AC's tummy, I can tell.
3873000	3875000	Oh sorry, sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to.
3875000	3877000	Oh no, no, no, no, the meds, not the meds, not the meds.
3877000	3879000	Don't get digested yet.
3879000	3882000	Slow release capsules, slow release capsules.
3882000	3885000	Do not digest the meds, okay?
3885000	3887000	Do not digest the meds.
3887000	3889000	Old hair colour.
3889000	3891000	She was sponding as a junior.
3891000	3895000	My ex would say 2cm mirrors isn't that much.
3895000	3898000	Do we laugh?
3898000	3903000	Or is this kind of like a therapy confession?
3903000	3907000	Wait, what do we do in response to that refling?
3910000	3912000	Hello Bobbi, I apologise.
3912000	3914000	No, no, don't apologise for being late, don't worry.
3914000	3916000	Point and empathise.
3917000	3919000	Oh boy.
3919000	3922000	We pour one out for the whole year.
3922000	3926000	No, don't worry about being late, we're literally just like giffing off doing some puzzles.
3926000	3928000	Point and cry.
3930000	3934000	Head pat the refling, head pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat.
3934000	3938000	Okay, we're putting AC together, we've managed to do ME,
3938000	3942000	but I guess because AC's face is sideways, you guys are struggling a wee bit.
3943000	3946000	Oh is someone trolling?
3946000	3948000	Hold on, I think someone's trolling.
3948000	3950000	One second.
3951000	3953000	Oh, that's not very nice.
3953000	3955000	Here we go.
3959000	3961000	Ta-da!
3965000	3969000	Ooh, pat, pat, pat, pat, put AC together.
3969000	3972000	Pat, pat, pat, pat, put other pieces together.
3980000	3983000	That is terrible.
3983000	3985000	Tiny, spiny, that is terrible.
3985000	3987000	Thank you for the tip.
3987000	3989000	No, we're not doing that.
3989000	3994000	Oh, okay, I'll put the last one on myself then.
3995000	4000000	I think everyone disconnected, so technically I put the last piece on myself.
4002000	4004000	Ta-da! Look!
4004000	4008000	So this artwork, now this was before I had the girls.
4008000	4013000	Again, this was before I knew who the girls were and how they're enjoying themselves.
4013000	4017000	But AC is two centimeters taller than me.
4018000	4027000	And AC has very wide hips and thigh ratio, whereas Emmy's quite plank-like.
4027000	4031000	But I don't mean that as an insult, I mean like true to Patan.
4031000	4036000	Like she's not very curvy, whereas AC is rather curvy.
4036000	4039000	And she does have a little bit of something.
4039000	4041000	Ta-da!
4041000	4043000	Very important detail for future collaboration.
4043000	4048000	The two little babies arguing over who's taller, even though they're both totally, honestly.
4048000	4052000	It gave me one moment.
4052000	4055000	Right, what have I got next?
4057000	4061000	Right, this one's going to be a super fast one because it's not the most exciting.
4061000	4070000	This originally was going to be an artwork used for an ASMR video, but I can't use it because...
4073000	4079000	Because ASMR on YouTube is rather odd at the moment.
4079000	4083000	I'm not really sure.
4083000	4086000	I'm not really sure.
4086000	4088000	Um...
4088000	4091000	Wait, hold on, let me pin it.
4091000	4092000	Okay, there we go.
4092000	4095000	Patreon won't lay- oh no, Patreon will, but um...
4095000	4098000	Yes, good luck with the artwork.
4098000	4105000	Now the artwork, I will give you a hint, is very awkward for the background.
4105000	4108000	Because the background is a spiral.
4108000	4114000	So I've made this 240 pieces, so I've made it a lot less.
4114000	4116000	Image of lungs breathing?
4116000	4120000	Yeah, breathing, basically.
4120000	4122000	You'll see it once you put it together.
4122000	4125000	Oh, you've already got my face, hold on.
4125000	4127000	No way, you're that fast.
4127000	4129000	You've never even seen the image before.
4129000	4133000	How are you so fast?
4133000	4137000	Hello, it's me Anonymous.
4137000	4139000	Hmm.
4144000	4147000	How are you so fast at making it?
4147000	4149000	There's a 3D art.
4149000	4154000	No way, you guys are that fast.
4154000	4160000	As high as the background is really difficult because it's like...
4160000	4162000	Everything's no mummy.
4162000	4164000	Oh, mummy's looking at the video.
4164000	4169000	No, you can't prove it, no.
4169000	4171000	There's no proof.
4171000	4175000	There's only proof once you've finished the image.
4175000	4178000	That Anon me, everyone in this lobby is me, I am Anon.
4178000	4181000	Wait, hold on, let me get out of the way, I'm in the way.
4181000	4183000	It's strong in time, I love strong calls.
4183000	4185000	Hello, it's me Anonymous, there's the 3D art.
4185000	4187000	Anon me, everyone in this lobby is me, mummy.
4187000	4189000	Your tongue is...
4189000	4191000	I can do it twice.
4195000	4197000	I made this pose.
4197000	4199000	Hypnotizing as if you're licking.
4199000	4202000	I don't know, you're gonna have to find out, you're just gonna have to do the puzzle.
4202000	4204000	Anon, we are replaying.
4204000	4208000	I'm gonna see if I can lurk here so you can still see the in-game chat if you wanted to.
4208000	4210000	You're licking us.
4212000	4214000	This.
4214000	4216000	Okay.
4220000	4222000	I never got a custom 3D or asset.
4222000	4225000	I'm not really that fuss for like custom assets.
4225000	4228000	I hope the girls aren't disappointed with me because I never really did that.
4228000	4235000	Like some feature agencies like, oh here's a custom, like game and set up, custom microphone, custom...
4236000	4241000	Like, nail asset and I'm just like, I can't really be arsed with that.
4241000	4243000	If the girls want it, they can get it in their donor thoughts.
4243000	4248000	Which sounds terrible, but I'm like, I've never been fussed for it.
4248000	4251000	It's terrible, I really shouldn't do it that way, but...
4251000	4254000	If I'm no fussed for it, the girls then they get it.
4254000	4255000	What's this?
4255000	4257000	Oh, you cut my hair together.
4258000	4262000	I don't know how I did that on the first go, but I did it.
4262000	4266000	So this is called a jigsaw, yeah.
4266000	4269000	And you can join in and have fun.
4273000	4276000	We'd let you hypnotise us and destroy humanity.
4276000	4281000	Yeah, I don't know if maybe my hearts have been softened by the reeflings
4281000	4284000	and I have been redeemed, if you will.
4287000	4290000	And that I no longer wish to perish humanity.
4290000	4300000	I'm starting to think that I definitely am having a change of heart to my lore.
4304000	4308000	So the reeflings have changed me for the better.
4308000	4312000	Their tentacles made all the difference and now I don't want to kill everyone anymore.
4313000	4316000	All thanks to your tentacle reefling.
4316000	4320000	Yeah, I don't want to perish humanity anymore.
4324000	4326000	Maybe just hold us like cow.
4328000	4334000	Right, now this is where this gets really awkward because there's so many hues.
4337000	4341000	So many hues and my hair really doesn't help either.
4342000	4347000	My hair makes this so awkward.
4348000	4353000	Pen up frustrations and wanting the world to end a timeless combo.
4362000	4365000	Stop, I will make that canon.
4365000	4369000	Stop, that's such a good lore edit.
4369000	4371000	Thank you tiny spiny.
4371000	4375000	I don't know how you guys feel about that, but maybe the reeflings softened my hearts
4375000	4378000	and I realised the problem wasn't humanity.
4378000	4381000	The problem was the high table.
4381000	4383000	I am so down.
4383000	4386000	And instead of using my hypnosis to take them down,
4386000	4389000	I hypnotise you to take them down for me.
4391000	4393000	I would abs strongly wick.
4393000	4397000	Honestly, down with that, yes, update your lore.
4397000	4399000	I just got timed out.
4399000	4402000	I think, I don't know if it's like breaking a bit.
4407000	4410000	Not all of humanity, just a handful of people.
4410000	4412000	Yeah, you use us.
4412000	4415000	Well, after you've taken down the high table,
4415000	4418000	I have all the time in the world to our word yet.
4419000	4427000	Oh my lord, it's like a dosion where the hero smashes the villainess into not being evil anymore.
4427000	4429000	Yeah, basically, I will commission that.
4429000	4431000	Please do not think I will commission that.
4431000	4434000	Maybe I could get like a proper dosion spread.
4434000	4436000	I don't know how much they cost though.
4436000	4442000	So one shot dosions I think can run like, depending on how many panels you have,
4442000	4445000	shy of a thousand, but like a full on spread.
4445000	4448000	I don't even know where you'd commission that honestly.
4453000	4455000	Did I see that?
4464000	4466000	Is it moving your positions?
4466000	4469000	Is it actually telling me who's picking up and dropping out?
4469000	4471000	Okay.
4474000	4476000	Is it our word?
4476000	4478000	If we like it, who knows?
4478000	4479000	We don't know yet.
4479000	4482000	I know an artist who does 50 per page with four panels a page.
4482000	4485000	Yes, I think when it comes to Donothon.
4485000	4488000	So, oh, I can't say that yet.
4488000	4490000	I can say it tomorrow.
4490000	4492000	I think I could say it tomorrow.
4492000	4494000	Right, I can't say it just yet, but I'll say it tomorrow.
4495000	4500000	A screenshot when someone keeps moving it.
4503000	4505000	Oh my God, what is that?
4518000	4521000	This is giving me a stroke and not a good count.
4521000	4522000	That's me.
4522000	4523000	That's my thing.
4523000	4526000	I think it's lagging out, unfortunately.
4527000	4529000	How do you even move the puzzle?
4529000	4531000	It's not moving.
4531000	4533000	Let me just fix over here.
4539000	4544000	I'll take the high score off because I don't even see the score.
4545000	4550000	The mods turned that wifling into Tokoyaki.
4550000	4552000	I came back to Crazy Talk.
4552000	4555000	It's not Crazy Talk if it's my lore, okay?
4555000	4557000	I'm allowed to have lore.
4557000	4559000	No, that doesn't sit there.
4561000	4562000	Oh, I dropped my piece.
4562000	4563000	Oops.
4563000	4564000	Oh.
4565000	4568000	Yeah, we're lagging a little bit.
4568000	4570000	Mods, deep fry that wifling.
4570000	4571000	We're breaking the site.
4571000	4572000	It's taming out.
4572000	4574000	It's the site taming out.
4577000	4579000	Oh, something about our wording.
4579000	4580000	It was a mis-
4580000	4581000	It was a mis-input.
4581000	4582000	It was a mis-input.
4588000	4590000	We're breaking the website stop.
4590000	4591000	That's actually so funny.
4591000	4592000	I feel so bad, though.
4592000	4595000	I'm sorry, Mr. Website owners.
4595000	4598000	We're just having fun making puzzles.
4598000	4599000	That's all.
4599000	4600000	They're going to be like,
4600000	4602000	who on earth is this weirdo licking the mic?
4602000	4605000	Because they can see the images as it's getting made.
4605000	4607000	They'll be like, what is going on here?
4607000	4612000	So, originally, this artwork was going to be a subscriber milestone,
4612000	4617000	but all of them are going to have to go on Twitter instead for free
4617000	4622000	because YouTube is stinky and it sucks.
4623000	4624000	Hello, I'm back.
4624000	4625000	Oh, my.
4625000	4627000	Yeah, look.
4627000	4629000	So, I was originally going to use it,
4629000	4631000	and the artist was really good
4631000	4632000	because I was like,
4632000	4634000	oh, can you just like make-
4634000	4636000	can you do something with a microphone
4636000	4638000	just so it's a bit more unique than a default?
4646000	4648000	Don't hold it.
4649000	4651000	So, it was going to go on YouTube,
4651000	4654000	but it failed because YouTube is stinky.
4657000	4660000	But that's my artwork, and it's me.
4660000	4661000	And I'm so cute.
4661000	4664000	And then I asked for like some custom stuff on it,
4664000	4666000	and they just like put me sticker on it.
4666000	4668000	I'm like, yeah, I'll take it.
4668000	4671000	I don't think I had your model yet.
4671000	4673000	I don't think I had your model yet.
4673000	4675000	I don't think I had your model yet.
4676000	4678000	I don't think I had your model yet,
4678000	4681000	but if I do get a custom 3DO asset,
4681000	4682000	I'm going to get you on it,
4682000	4683000	and I'll be like,
4683000	4685000	I'll get a little sticker here,
4685000	4686000	and then a little speech,
4686000	4688000	and it says, I was R-worded,
4688000	4690000	and you're all happy about it.
4690000	4692000	There's something like that.
4692000	4693000	I don't know what.
4693000	4695000	And then that's me with my little squiggly,
4695000	4697000	wiggly eye.
4699000	4701000	I like the way it does.
4702000	4703000	Okay.
4703000	4706000	Now I do have...
4706000	4708000	Hold on, I'm from my dad's birth.
4708000	4709000	I'm so weird.
4710000	4711000	Okay, let me hide it,
4711000	4713000	and then we'll make a new puzzle, okay?
4714000	4715000	It's so cute.
4715000	4716000	It's so cute.
4716000	4717000	Thank you.
4717000	4719000	Okay, what's the image?
4722000	4726000	Okay, you have a choice of a meme or a comic strip.
4726000	4728000	Both involve all the girls.
4728000	4729000	Meme?
4729000	4731000	Or comic strip?
4731000	4732000	Your choice.
4732000	4734000	Dayler's choice.
4734000	4738000	Comic strip, meme, comic, meme, meme, meme.
4738000	4739000	Oh, meme one.
4739000	4740000	Okay, meme one.
4740000	4741000	Meme one.
4741000	4742000	Hold on.
4742000	4746000	I am going to do 450 pieces for this one,
4746000	4749000	because it's got all of us in it, okay?
4750000	4751000	So don't be shy.
4752000	4753000	Do some more.
4753000	4754000	Let's see.
4755000	4757000	Let's see, let's see, let's see.
4757000	4758000	Generating puzzle.
4760000	4761000	You ready?
4763000	4765000	I know it looks confusing.
4765000	4767000	Hold on, I'm putting the puzzle in chat right now.
4767000	4768000	Puzzle.
4770000	4773000	This one slightly more difficult,
4773000	4774000	but have a show?
4774000	4775000	Have a show?
4775000	4776000	Have a goal?
4776000	4777000	Have a show?
4777000	4778000	Have a show?
4778000	4779000	Have a show?
4779000	4780000	Have a show?
4780000	4781000	Have a show?
4781000	4782000	Have a show?
4782000	4783000	Have a goal?
4784000	4788000	I like that idea of being hypnotized is me to feel it.
4789000	4790000	Good luck with this one.
4791000	4793000	This is not an easy one.
4794000	4795000	My fingers is hard.
4795000	4797000	I love Johnny Cuddles.
4797000	4798000	I love Reefling.
4799000	4800000	Are you Reefling Cuddles?
4800000	4802000	Is that your full legal name?
4802000	4803000	Reefling Cuddles?
4806000	4808000	Yeah, Reefling Cuddles would be your full name.
4808000	4809000	Yeah.
4810000	4811000	By the Pope.
4812000	4814000	Now remember, this is a meme.
4815000	4817000	This is not an easy one.
4818000	4822000	Oh, some's already got the bottom corner credit for the artist.
4823000	4826000	We'll take on your last name if you want us to.
4826000	4827000	Yeah.
4828000	4830000	Are we taking your last name?
4831000	4832000	Reefling Cuddles?
4832000	4834000	Pipe Jim, we could get a comic for the girls.
4834000	4835000	That would be rad.
4836000	4837000	Yeah, of course.
4837000	4838000	I would never say no to that.
4838000	4840000	If the girls want comics, I'll make them.
4840000	4844000	Someone out there is going to get a legal name change to Reefling Cuddles now.
4845000	4847000	That would be pretty badass, sorry,
4847000	4850000	but they would get my used panties in the mail or something,
4850000	4851000	because that's so badass.
4851000	4854000	No, do not actually legalize me for your name.
4855000	4856000	We'd be taking your last name.
4856000	4857000	We have no full name.
4857000	4858000	We have the title, though.
4858000	4860000	Reefling the Ink Supplier!
4861000	4862000	Reefling the Plentiful,
4862000	4863000	Reefling the Bountiful,
4863000	4865000	Reefling the Unending Ink...
4865000	4867000	Ink...
4868000	4869000	Reveal her dosion.
4869000	4870000	Let's go.
4870000	4872000	I would never say no to that.
4872000	4873000	Never say no.
4874000	4877000	Making a fake person a name in a mania?
4877000	4878000	It's too late.
4878000	4879000	I've set it in stone.
4879000	4880000	You've already contacted...
4880000	4881000	Oh!
4881000	4883000	I see Azura forming.
4884000	4885000	I see Emmy.
4885000	4888000	I see I see I see Azura on me.
4888000	4890000	Sorry, I'm punching the mic right now.
4891000	4892000	My apologies.
4893000	4894000	Oh, the bottom.
4895000	4897000	The bottom is starting to show hints.
4898000	4899000	Emmy.
4900000	4902000	I will very quickly move over
4902000	4904000	just so you can see the bottom is showing hints
4904000	4906000	of what this content is.
4908000	4909000	Punch again.
4909000	4910000	I'm not punching the mic.
4910000	4911000	Fade the mic.
4911000	4912000	Boom, boom, boom.
4912000	4914000	Resisting the urge to change the name change.
4914000	4915000	The name change...
4915000	4916000	No!
4916000	4917000	Elden Ring Boss Drop.
4917000	4919000	Reefling the Bountiful.
4920000	4923000	All the Vela girls have their own pills.
4923000	4924000	Nice.
4924000	4925000	Oh!
4927000	4929000	But wait, there's more.
4929000	4931000	There's more to this meme.
4934000	4935000	Oh.
4936000	4938000	Oh wait, why does it...
4938000	4940000	Well, I got bigger.
4940000	4941000	Yeah.
4942000	4943000	Again there.
4945000	4947000	Oh, what's this?
4947000	4948000	Oh!
4948000	4949000	Oh!
4949000	4951000	Reeflings cracked the case on Azura.
4951000	4954000	I repeat, the Reeflings have cracked the case on Azura.
4955000	4958000	What is this artwork all about?
4958000	4959000	Oh!
4959000	4961000	Reeflings are doing it.
4961000	4963000	They're doing it.
4963000	4964000	They're doing it.
4965000	4968000	They're cracking the case wide open.
4970000	4973000	What is this meme all about?
4977000	4979000	So is it for Gotham?
4982000	4984000	Alright, we got Azura packing up.
4984000	4985000	Rep it up.
4986000	4989000	Stream idea for fstreams?
4989000	4991000	Literally this, except...
4991000	4993000	Yeah, no, I'd be done for that, that's hilarious.
4993000	4998000	Oh my god, we should do a puzzle on Bansley.
4998000	5001000	And then we have to all squeeze one out to it.
5001000	5006000	And then we wait 15 minutes and then we have to go next!
5007000	5013000	I'd be so down for that, that's hilarious.
5013000	5017000	Would you change your legal name for a Reefling snack?
5018000	5019000	I have to do it?
5019000	5021000	We have to like force ourselves?
5021000	5024000	By the third one all of us are like, we can't go on.
5024000	5025000	Go on without us.
5025000	5028000	There'll be one Reefling that's like, you guys are struggling?
5030000	5032000	Different kind of endurance stream.
5033000	5038000	Oh, the case is getting cracked wide open.
5044000	5052000	Oh wow, completely just sealed off the lower section of this meme.
5056000	5059000	I'm loving this, I'm so sorry if it's like low entertainment.
5059000	5064000	I am adoring this, like revealing artwork via making you do logic puzzles.
5064000	5068000	It is hilarious, I'm sorry, but it is.
5070000	5074000	Like, you will be rewarded with new artwork that you haven't seen before,
5074000	5076000	but first you must do this puzzle.
5079000	5082000	That's absolutely ridiculous.
5082000	5090000	Guys, can you solve a little sorority of rest, honestly?
5090000	5093000	It's like why old wizard riddles?
5093000	5097000	Astority, this one needs to be poster wall art.
5097000	5098000	Oh my god.
5103000	5104000	No.
5107000	5109000	Which one of these pills is piagra?
5109000	5110000	Stop!
5110000	5112000	Why do they ask for which one?
5112000	5114000	I think piagra's blue.
5119000	5120000	Surely.
5120000	5124000	I mean, you guys have done so well, that was not an easy one.
5126000	5128000	You guys keep doing so well, I can't believe it.
5129000	5132000	This is peak iPad entertainment.
5132000	5134000	Stop is actually.
5137000	5139000	I'm taking the strony fell.
5139000	5141000	Yes, so this meme concept.
5141000	5145000	So I ordered artwork of everyone stepping on the viewer.
5145000	5152000	Now, this was before Azura was finalized with her reference sheet.
5152000	5158000	Azura is a lot more chocolate in her concept art, and this is what the artist had to use.
5160000	5164000	And she's a lot, and she's not even got her markings and stuff.
5164000	5166000	You know, this is older.
5167000	5168000	But yeah.
5168000	5175000	And you can tell this one's older for me, because I have brown, like, apparel things that come out the back.
5175000	5177000	That's when you know it's not my design.
5177000	5181000	Again, Shibi has lines instead of ropes, the classic.
5181000	5183000	Mercy, no nail polish.
5183000	5187000	No one has nail polish at this stage of development when I ordered this,
5187000	5190000	but I was like, yeah, I want to step on new artwork.
5193000	5195000	I'm so red-pilled.
5195000	5197000	Skinny Azura jumpscare.
5197000	5201000	I cannot tell you how many times I have to go to an artist and be like,
5201000	5203000	make her plump.
5203000	5204000	She's a mummy.
5204000	5207000	Literally, she has birthed all of humanity.
5207000	5209000	She got them birth in hips.
5209000	5211000	She got a tummy.
5211000	5212000	You know?
5214000	5216000	What are you doing?
5216000	5219000	AC censored me live in a society.
5219000	5221000	It was very, there we go.
5221000	5222000	You did it.
5222000	5224000	You unlocked the meme.
5224000	5226000	Check it out.
5226000	5228000	Steps on you.
5237000	5240000	Okay, I believe I have one more artwork.
5240000	5242000	But yeah, it was like, pick your pill.
5242000	5245000	The purple, the green, the red, the purple.
5245000	5247000	Oh, we didn't think that.
5247000	5248000	Wait, what?
5248000	5251000	The light purple, the lilac, I guess.
5251000	5253000	And then the purple, the orange, or the blue.
5253000	5255000	Purple and purple.
5255000	5256000	Hmm.
5256000	5257000	Yes.
5257000	5258000	Maybe we should have done pink,
5258000	5260000	because Mercy does have a bit of pink in her design.
5260000	5262000	That probably would have been wiser, but hey-ho.
5262000	5264000	Pink, but yeah, I would say pink as well.
5264000	5265000	I'll take all six.
5265000	5267000	Are you going to half them all?
5269000	5271000	An ironically great advertisement?
5271000	5272000	Oh, really?
5272000	5273000	You like that?
5273000	5275000	Wait, I'll get this changed to pink,
5275000	5279000	and then we'll put it on the main viewer, kind of, or that.
5280000	5281000	And we're done.
5281000	5282000	Wait, hold on.
5282000	5284000	Let me just double check my files.
5284000	5286000	Oh, no, there's...
5286000	5290000	Okay, there's an ASMR collab artwork with all of us together.
5290000	5292000	It could have made you pink in her teal.
5292000	5293000	Yes.
5293000	5295000	Hi, Fua.
5295000	5297000	There's an ASMR collab artwork,
5297000	5302000	or there is a meme comic strip.
5303000	5306000	ASMR or meme comic strip.
5306000	5310000	I didn't see the other image that I had lurking in the shadows.
5310000	5311000	Hi.
5311000	5313000	We need to see the art collab.
5313000	5314000	ASMR, ASMR.
5314000	5317000	Meme, comic, comic, comic, ASMR.
5317000	5320000	Oh, you guys are like 50-50 split, ASMR.
5320000	5322000	All right, we'll do the ASMR,
5322000	5325000	but I'll do 250 pieces.
5325000	5327000	250 blazes.
5327000	5328000	Great.
5329000	5332000	This one has the Veiler logo in the background,
5332000	5334000	just for simplicity's sake,
5334000	5338000	because again, it's one of those ones where it's rather on the odd side.
5338000	5339000	Puzzle.
5339000	5342000	Oh, I like this game where you put it in your own image.
5342000	5343000	Yes.
5343000	5345000	I highly recommend it for streams.
5345000	5349000	I'm currently leaking artwork that's never been seen before via puzzles.
5349000	5353000	I'm making them do logic puzzles in order to access it.
5353000	5356000	It's the most bizarre thing Fua.
5356000	5358000	So you should consider it.
5358000	5361000	Rustic, thank you for the gen...
5361000	5363000	Try again.
5363000	5366000	Thank you, Rustic, for the gentifted mentorship.
5366000	5367000	What?
5367000	5368000	Hello, Rustic.
5368000	5371000	Thank you so much for the gifted 10 memberships to the channel.
5371000	5372000	Thank you.
5372000	5373000	I really appreciate that.
5373000	5375000	And congrats to those who caught it with your face.
5375000	5377000	What was that?
5377000	5379000	I'm taking a drink of water right now.
5379000	5381000	Oh my gosh.
5381000	5383000	I'm taking a drink of water right now.
5386000	5387000	Oh my gosh.
5387000	5388000	I'm taking water.
5388000	5389000	I need to...
5389000	5391000	I think I'm having a nap after this one.
5394000	5396000	Thank you for the gifted memberships.
5396000	5397000	Oh my god.
5397000	5399000	I think I need a good sleep.
5399000	5401000	But I'm okay.
5401000	5404000	I could not get that out there.
5406000	5408000	Gentifted memberfish?
5408000	5410000	That's not what I said.
5410000	5411000	Nice.
5411000	5413000	It's only just having a stroke.
5413000	5416000	I'm thinking about the bands these streams a little too much.
5416000	5420000	But yes, Fua, I highly recommend leaking artwork
5420000	5422000	via making puzzle streams.
5422000	5424000	It's absolutely hilarious.
5426000	5428000	Because I'm showing stuff that's not been shown yet.
5428000	5430000	And it's just so fun.
5431000	5432000	Oh, we already have our canvas.
5432000	5434000	Now, it did make it a wee bit easier.
5434000	5436000	I didn't do too much.
5438000	5439000	Oh yeah?
5440000	5442000	Okay, I'm having the time of her life.
5443000	5445000	The gentifted member.
5445000	5448000	How did you jumble those words in perfect sequence?
5448000	5450000	I do it quite often.
5450000	5452000	I can accidentally swat.
5452000	5454000	I take the first letter.
5454000	5456000	Oh god, I'm supposed to say that.
5456000	5458000	Knee die, Julie.
5458000	5460000	Thank you for the 20 gifted memberships.
5460000	5461000	That's right.
5461000	5462000	I said it right this time.
5462000	5463000	What are you going to do about it, huh?
5463000	5464000	Are you disappointed?
5464000	5466000	Knee die, Julie.
5466000	5468000	That I said it correctly.
5468000	5470000	20 gifted memberships.
5471000	5472000	Okay.
5472000	5473000	Thank you so much.
5473000	5474000	I appreciate that.
5474000	5476000	You guys are going to end up getting me another emoji slot.
5476000	5477000	You know that, right?
5477000	5479000	I'm like, people are so fast.
5479000	5481000	I'm trying to get a single piece.
5481000	5483000	That reflins are on it like a blood type.
5483000	5486000	I did pick out 250 pieces for this one
5486000	5487000	because I didn't know.
5487000	5489000	Strongly struggling.
5489000	5490000	Strongly is struggling.
5490000	5493000	But congrats to those who caught it with their face.
5494000	5496000	And you have access to all the emotes.
5496000	5497000	There's more emotes on the way.
5497000	5498000	I promise.
5498000	5500000	I have 13 more emotes.
5500000	5502000	And give Mercy some room.
5502000	5504000	Please excuse me.
5504000	5507000	Mommy, the reflins are hogging the shared brain cell.
5507000	5508000	Oh, it's okay.
5508000	5509000	Sleepy Phoenix.
5509000	5510000	Thank you.
5510000	5511000	Thank you for the tip.
5511000	5512000	But yes.
5512000	5514000	I don't know what happened there.
5514000	5515000	I took a drink of water
5515000	5517000	and now I can speak all over again.
5517000	5518000	So that's good.
5518000	5519000	That's good.
5519000	5520000	We should make a thousand.
5520000	5524000	It only goes up to 700, I think.
5527000	5528000	So this is the next group.
5528000	5530000	ASMR collab.
5531000	5533000	What do you think it is, reflins?
5533000	5535000	What do you think is happening in this collab?
5536000	5537000	I got one!
5537000	5538000	Yippee!
5538000	5540000	Are you squidding me right now?
5541000	5543000	Wait, that is so delayed.
5545000	5546000	That is so delayed.
5546000	5548000	Thank you again, Sleepy Phoenix.
5548000	5549000	Are you okay, YouTube?
5549000	5550000	You took a sec.
5550000	5552000	I read that quite a moment before.
5554000	5557000	Do 1,000 rotated pieces
5557000	5559000	blowing air into our ears?
5560000	5561000	Not air.
5561000	5562000	Not blowing.
5563000	5565000	A different kind of ASMR.
5567000	5568000	A group kiss?
5569000	5571000	We're sniffing you ASMR.
5571000	5574000	All six of us are sniffing you going
5574000	5577000	but it's binaural sniffing.
5577000	5580000	So six binaural layered sniffing
5580000	5584000	and you're going to be pheromone maxing for us, okay?
5585000	5589000	So that's what the next group ASMR collab is with us.
5590000	5593000	It's all about pheromone maxing.
5593000	5595000	I hope you're ready for it.
5595000	5597000	The full sniffing experience.
5600000	5603000	That's 12 nostrils to smell every little piece of you.
5603000	5606000	No shower for a month, God, at the big sniff.
5606000	5609000	God, I hope she likes my pheromone stink.
5612000	5616000	With me, everything will be ready for it.
5616000	5618000	But yeah, look, are you humping?
5618000	5622000	Are you? Why are you gyrating the image?
5622000	5625000	Why are you doing this sexually?
5625000	5626000	Briefly.
5626000	5627000	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
5627000	5628000	Fucking steady.
5628000	5630000	I need a bit of fire play.
5632000	5633000	Okay, yeah.
5633000	5635000	Oh, there is 1,000 pieces.
5635000	5637000	Okay, I don't think I'm going to do it on this image.
5637000	5640000	There's images too difficult to do 1,000 pieces on.
5641000	5645000	We'll do 450 pieces.
5649000	5651000	Let's see, 450 blaze it.
5651000	5652000	Great room.
5652000	5654000	Comic time.
5654000	5659000	So originally, I was going to release a monthly comic on Villalour.
5659000	5661000	Like, for the pro, I'm going to sneeze.
5665000	5667000	Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
5667000	5668000	That was really weird.
5673000	5674000	Puzzle.
5675000	5676000	Sorry, I'm sorry.
5676000	5678000	Sorry, that was a weird one.
5679000	5680000	Bless you.
5680000	5682000	Thank you, Bill.
5682000	5684000	Aggressive sneeze, yeah.
5684000	5685000	I'm afraid I'm not.
5687000	5690000	Get out of my nose kind of sneeze.
5690000	5693000	Okay, now, originally, I was going to do a comic
5693000	5695000	every month kind of Villalour.
5695000	5696000	Fun.
5696000	5698000	Damn, she busted me sneezes.
5698000	5700000	Apparently, it's one-tenth of it.
5700000	5702000	Be aggressive on me however you prefer.
5703000	5706000	Yes, but the plan kind of failed through
5706000	5709000	because it wasn't going to work out.
5709000	5711000	I need like a specific artist type for it
5711000	5713000	and I couldn't get a hold of one.
5713000	5716000	And then I got so busy with all the other issues.
5716000	5718000	Like I've kind of said, like debut was,
5718000	5722000	the month of May was absolutely horrific.
5723000	5725000	Everyone went past deadlines.
5725000	5729000	Everyone, like when, even when I was getting sent stuff
5729000	5731000	that was complete, it was like,
5731000	5735000	it was like a joke because there was so many obvious edits
5735000	5738000	and fixes and subtitle issues or whatever
5738000	5740000	and it was just horrible.
5740000	5743000	So yeah, this plan got put on the back burner.
5743000	5744000	I'm not really sure.
5746000	5748000	I want to do unspeakable things with Strony Cuttles
5748000	5751000	or do you want me to do unspeakable things to you?
5751000	5752000	What one is it?
5752000	5753000	Quick.
5755000	5756000	The Wheel of King.
5756000	5757000	What?
5758000	5763000	There's no way you can see that.
5765000	5766000	What?
5767000	5769000	Have I shown this before?
5769000	5771000	How could you have guessed that?
5771000	5773000	Amy, is that you on and all?
5773000	5774000	Is that one of you guys?
5774000	5776000	How could you have guessed that?
5777000	5779000	It's been a tough year at Commission Art.
5779000	5780000	It's not their fault.
5780000	5781000	I think everyone has taken a lot of work
5781000	5783000	because things are getting more expensive.
5784000	5787000	Well, yes.
5787000	5791000	Some artists unfortunately do over-promise on deadlines.
5791000	5794000	How could you have fricking guessed that?
5794000	5795000	I don't know. Zoom in.
5795000	5796000	We can read Mummy.
5796000	5797000	Oh, okay.
5798000	5799000	Yes.
5799000	5802000	No, there was a lot of developmental issues
5802000	5803000	with Veilor behind the scenes.
5803000	5806000	I commissioned stuff well in advance
5806000	5810000	and then it was announced that Veilor's debut was on June 1
5810000	5813000	and collectively, I kid you not,
5813000	5815000	every single artist that we were working with
5815000	5818000	saw that and then all of a sudden,
5818000	5821000	my commission that was on track was getting delayed
5821000	5824000	past the deadline I had given
5824000	5827000	and it just became an absolute nightmare.
5829000	5831000	So don't be surprised that Gen 2
5831000	5833000	don't have an announcement date
5833000	5835000	until it's actually all ready to go
5835000	5838000	because I am not going through that stress again.
5838000	5841000	I literally almost developed a stomach ulcer.
5841000	5843000	It was that bad.
5844000	5847000	I like Sheeby's chest has been put together.
5847000	5848000	Have you put her?
5849000	5852000	You've put together Sheeby's booba.
5853000	5857000	But yes, this was just kind of like a test sample
5857000	5861000	for the comics.
5861000	5864000	This was a draft, a sample, if you will.
5864000	5866000	I will give you a hint.
5866000	5871000	Mercy is talking to me in the first panel at the top.
5871000	5874000	That is your hint for this puzzle.
5874000	5877000	Mercy and I are having a conversation.
5877000	5878000	I'm sorry it was so stressful.
5878000	5880000	I'm still amazed at the amount of what you did
5880000	5882000	to prepare for debuting yourself.
5882000	5883000	Yes!
5885000	5888000	Everything got put on the back burner for me
5888000	5891000	to make sure the girls and everything was correct.
5891000	5892000	Oh, you've already done it.
5892000	5894000	Holy shit, you've already got a little scared.
5894000	5895000	Well, there you go.
5895000	5896000	You got the comic outline.
5896000	5897000	Ta-da!
5897000	5898000	Oh, it's gone.
5899000	5900000	But I worked it in the end.
5900000	5902000	That's the most important thing.
5902000	5907000	I am absolutely not telling any artists.
5909000	5911000	I'm just giving deadlines that are fair.
5913000	5915000	Anyway, lessons learned.
5915000	5917000	It was a massive learning curve.
5917000	5919000	Honestly, anything new you do in life
5919000	5921000	is a massive learning curve.
5921000	5923000	So I'm glad that I had the opportunity to do it.
5925000	5927000	It was a hoot and a holler.
5929000	5932000	If curiosity, which of the girls can draw,
5932000	5937000	all of them have some sort of drawing experience but me.
5938000	5941000	I am the only one that has zero skills.
5942000	5945000	Literally, my only skill is licking a microphone
5945000	5947000	and I stand by that proudly.
5947000	5949000	That's all I got going for me.
5949000	5952000	That and my addiction to reeflings.
5952000	5954000	That's what I got going for me.
5954000	5955000	Life's good.
5955000	5956000	That's all I need.
5956000	5957000	That's all I need.
5957000	5958000	Life is good.
5961000	5964000	All her skill points went to specific games
5964000	5966000	and her tongue game, honestly.
5969000	5970000	You're a great entertainer.
5970000	5971000	Oh, you stop.
5971000	5973000	Yeah, you're gonna make me blue.
5974000	5976000	Oh, that's not gonna stop you.
5976000	5977000	Your voice is hoot too.
5977000	5979000	My actual voice?
5979000	5980000	I don't know.
5980000	5982000	I feel it in my eyes.
5982000	5984000	That's what I feel like I sound like.
5988000	5990000	That's what I sound like in my head.
5990000	5992000	Who said Farky?
5992000	5995000	Oh, it's in the comic strip.
5995000	5998000	Sorry, it's in the comic strip.
5998000	5999000	A master assassin.
5999000	6002000	I am a master assassin in Assassin's Creed.
6002000	6005000	The best game of all time, which we get to play
6005000	6007000	on December...
6007000	6010000	December, October 10th.
6013000	6015000	That's your actual voice?
6015000	6017000	Voice, I can't believe it dropped through.
6017000	6019000	October 10th, we're playing Assassin's Creed
6019000	6021000	all over again and I'm so excited.
6021000	6024000	I'm so excited.
6024000	6027000	I just can't hide.
6027000	6031000	And on October 8th, we're playing Assassin's Creed 2
6031000	6034000	and then the next day, we're doing 100% feather run
6034000	6037000	and then we're playing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
6037000	6041000	on my birthday, which I'm so excited about
6041000	6042000	when I get two days.
6042000	6045000	Well, it's gonna be a 40-hour event.
6049000	6051000	It's crashing again.
6052000	6053000	Oh my god.
6053000	6055000	Am I allowed to fart? Excuse me.
6056000	6060000	Actually, I just want you all to know
6060000	6063000	that...
6063000	6065000	Amy...
6065000	6068000	I'm gonna out her right now.
6068000	6070000	Amy sent me two clips of her farting
6070000	6073000	to be highlighted into a short.
6073000	6075000	I did not go seek them out.
6075000	6076000	She sent them because she was like,
6076000	6078000	oh, this is kind of funny.
6078000	6081000	I had to send a...
6081000	6084000	a new person that is working with Veal
6084000	6088000	or two clips of Amy farting.
6088000	6091000	I'm like, you know, I had to type up a message.
6091000	6092000	I'm like, hi.
6092000	6095000	Thank you so much for waiting on your first batch of work.
6095000	6098000	Here's a link to the clips
6098000	6102000	that the talent Amy has requested to be made into shorts.
6102000	6104000	You have full editing rights.
6104000	6106000	We're not gonna dictate it.
6106000	6109000	And the last two clips were her farting.
6111000	6112000	Did they think you were joking?
6112000	6114000	She took it on stream.
6114000	6116000	Oh, she took it. She took it twice.
6116000	6118000	She forced it out.
6118000	6120000	I had to sit and review the clip
6120000	6122000	to send away to make sure it was acceptable
6122000	6124000	to be turned into a short.
6124000	6127000	So I had to listen to Amy go...
6127000	6129000	and then a little took came out.
6129000	6131000	And then she's like, did you hear it?
6131000	6133000	Did you hear it?
6133000	6134000	I did it!
6134000	6136000	Like, she was so proud of herself.
6136000	6140000	Expelling that air from her guts, honestly.
6141000	6143000	That editor, happy as Larry.
6143000	6146000	No, the editor came back and was like,
6146000	6148000	crass humor like that doesn't normally land.
6148000	6150000	Amy not beating the allegations.
6150000	6151000	That's so funny.
6151000	6153000	She even made a face to...
6155000	6157000	Where did you even find these girls?
6157000	6159000	The girls found me!
6159000	6160000	That's the best part.
6160000	6161000	I'll be here.
6161000	6164000	They were crazy enough to be like,
6164000	6165000	yeah, I want to be a part of that.
6165000	6167000	And I'm like, oh, don't mind if I do.
6168000	6169000	So anyway, again, as I said,
6169000	6172000	this is just a draft concept of a comic strip
6172000	6174000	that we may or may not do.
6174000	6176000	That's so funny.
6176000	6178000	She's giving us a real girlfriend experience.
6178000	6180000	I feel sorry for the guy,
6180000	6182000	but I love my little sister that, honestly.
6182000	6183000	It's a crass noise, alright.
6185000	6186000	I don't have my...
6186000	6188000	I don't have my set on board open.
6188000	6190000	I'm just gonna have to do it myself.
6191000	6192000	Eh...
6193000	6196000	Shawnee is a master reefling wrangler?
6196000	6197000	Oh yeah.
6198000	6200000	Ooh boo, tomato, tomato.
6200000	6201000	How about speaking out?
6201000	6203000	Why am I all too ill all of a sudden?
6208000	6210000	Oh, that one was a whistle note.
6210000	6212000	Her LLE came out with me there.
6213000	6214000	No one noticed yesterday,
6214000	6215000	Azura's horns and shebe's chest
6215000	6217000	with the little paper on top
6217000	6219000	give birth to the seventh...
6219000	6220000	What?
6220000	6221000	No one noticed, but yesterday,
6221000	6223000	Azura's horns and shebe's chest
6223000	6225000	with the little paper on top
6225000	6227000	give birth to the seventh secret member of your...
6227000	6229000	What are you saying?
6233000	6235000	I don't know what you're saying.
6235000	6237000	What does that mean?
6237000	6239000	Now we just need a Shawnee to enclet...
6239000	6240000	No!
6240000	6243000	Well, for my doughnut song, yes!
6243000	6245000	But in general, no!
6249000	6252000	During the VTuber review collab or something?
6254000	6255000	Am I going crazy?
6257000	6259000	The paper above a head?
6260000	6262000	And there might be ways.
6267000	6268000	Who is...
6268000	6271000	You don't need to move the thing anymore,
6271000	6272000	Reefland.
6273000	6275000	Or is it just lagging out completely?
6275000	6278000	It may be lagging out as well, so...
6278000	6280000	Someone keeps shaking it.
6280000	6282000	I think it's definitely lagging out
6282000	6285000	because we've overloaded their wee servers.
6286000	6288000	The lag makes me feel like...
6290000	6292000	Ooh, so this is the first comic.
6292000	6295000	I don't know if it's entertaining enough.
6295000	6297000	Maybe I'll get it professionally ironed out.
6297000	6300000	But this was, again, before I knew the girls
6300000	6302000	and the designs and all that jazz.
6303000	6304000	American Idol.
6307000	6308000	Ta-da!
6308000	6309000	So the comic goes,
6309000	6312000	So, if Vila doesn't do suspensions,
6312000	6313000	how do you punish us?
6313000	6315000	And I say, oh, I just spin the wheel.
6315000	6316000	The wheel?
6316000	6318000	If you misbehave,
6318000	6321000	I commission artwork on whatever lands the wheel lands on.
6321000	6323000	And it's like all these, like, stuff
6323000	6325000	that you don't normally do.
6325000	6326000	And everyone goes,
6326000	6327000	Well, babe!
6328000	6331000	Because we don't do suspensions at Vila.
6331000	6333000	I have absolutely no desire to do it.
6333000	6334000	I think it's disgusting.
6335000	6337000	So, yeah, that was my meme on, like,
6337000	6338000	this is what happened.
6338000	6339000	This is what I do.
6339000	6341000	And then that's my face all serious.
6343000	6345000	That was my first draft of a meme.
6345000	6347000	I thought it was rather humorous,
6347000	6349000	but, yeah.
6349000	6350000	Oh, StrayPube.
6350000	6353000	Bro, when I figured out what StrayPube was,
6353000	6355000	I was like, is this for real?
6355000	6356000	But it's a real tag.
6356000	6357000	It's funny.
6357000	6360000	Um, yeah.
6361000	6362000	Serious?
6362000	6365000	More like psychotic reaction image of StrayPube.
6366000	6368000	If you misbehave, Reeflings.
6369000	6373000	Um, I think that's all the images I had to share.
6373000	6377000	Now, I could do my thumbnails.
6377000	6379000	If you want, very quickly,
6379000	6381000	we could do my thumbnails for the week.
6381000	6383000	They're not too exciting.
6384000	6387000	Um, would you like to do that before I go offline, yeah?
6388000	6391000	That's the one in the corner of the mouth, right?
6391000	6392000	I hate it.
6392000	6393000	It depends.
6395000	6397000	I'm in the corner.
6397000	6398000	Yes, you want to do my thumbnails.
6398000	6400000	Okay, one second.
6400000	6403000	I'm just pulling them up now.
6405000	6409000	Shimmy, shimmy, yeah, shimmy, yeah, shimmy, yeah.
6410000	6411000	Drank.
6412000	6414000	How many thumbnails have I got?
6415000	6417000	Now, I will make these smaller.
6417000	6421000	I think I'm actually going to go back on the Mario Kart one before.
6422000	6425000	Anyone's like, I'm really disappointed in that.
6426000	6427000	That was my PC.
6427000	6428000	That wasn't you.
6429000	6434000	My PC takes like a whole five seconds to comprehend that it's just downloaded an image.
6434000	6437000	It has such a hissy fit over it.
6438000	6443000	I'm definitely going to go back in the Mario Kart one and add you guys in it because...
6445000	6446000	Right.
6447000	6448000	I'll try.
6448000	6450000	I'll test what 50 pieces looks like.
6450000	6452000	I don't know, 50 is like far too easy though.
6454000	6455000	Okay.
6456000	6459000	No, I feel like 50 is just...
6461000	6462000	Fuck it, fuck it.
6462000	6463000	We'll try 50.
6463000	6465000	Okay, we'll try 50.
6465000	6469000	It's not a big deal because we have other ones to go through if we want, if we so desire.
6470000	6472000	Oh my God, this is far too easy.
6472000	6474000	No, sorry, this is what I see.
6474000	6476000	Just so you know, this is what I see.
6476000	6477000	That's far too easy.
6478000	6480000	No, we're not doing that.
6480000	6482000	We'll do 250, believe it.
6482000	6483000	My apologies.
6484000	6485000	I thank you guys.
6486000	6489000	My PC hates putting input.
6489000	6490000	Oh my God, it hates me.
6490000	6491000	Just so you know.
6492000	6493000	Only 50...
6493000	6494000	The wiefling is drowning.
6494000	6496000	Everyone does one piece each.
6496000	6498000	We have to be organized like that.
6498000	6500000	Okay, these are the last...
6500000	6503000	There's seven more to go, but these are the last puzzles.
6505000	6506000	And then we're done!
6506000	6507000	We did it!
6508000	6510000	We did all the puzzles.
6511000	6513000	So you can see a little bit of text.
6513000	6515000	You can see there's a red stop sign.
6515000	6517000	Maybe some sort of red stop sign.
6518000	6520000	I'm glad Mummy did this to me.
6520000	6522000	She likes to do puzzles for other reasons.
6522000	6523000	Are you enjoying it?
6523000	6524000	I'm glad.
6524000	6527000	I feel like it's so fun doing little insider stuff.
6527000	6529000	I definitely want to do this in the future
6529000	6532000	when I get more artworks for the girls and stuff.
6532000	6535000	Me leaking gen 2 via puzzles!
6535000	6536000	Stop!
6536000	6537000	Stop!
6537000	6539000	The reason I'm saying stop is because I'm dumb enough
6539000	6540000	to want to try and do that.
6540000	6542000	No, I'm not leaking gen 2 designs.
6545000	6547000	Via a fucking puzzle game.
6550000	6552000	So this is my first stream tomorrow,
6552000	6554000	which is
6554000	6556000	drawing
6556000	6558000	your gen 2 suggestions.
6558000	6561000	So what would I put inside the big red sign?
6561000	6563000	Alright, I'm lurking for the rest.
6563000	6564000	Kisses!
6564000	6566000	Thank you for hanging and be playing.
6566000	6568000	Yes, I will wrap up the stream,
6568000	6570000	and we will redirect into Shibu!
6570000	6572000	Cotton bomb!
6573000	6575000	Sorry, I'm having a big stretch.
6577000	6578000	But this was so fun.
6578000	6581000	This was such a little goofy stream.
6581000	6582000	Bye-bye!
6582000	6584000	Bye-poo-ah!
6586000	6587000	Thanks for being chinny,
6587000	6588000	thanks for hanging.
6589000	6592000	Alright, I'll zoom in a little bit more.
6594000	6595000	She hates slime girls.
6595000	6598000	Yeah, the sign says no slime girls.
6598000	6600000	But I already know I'm going to have to draw one.
6600000	6603000	I already know I'm going to have to draw one.
6604000	6606000	Oh yeah, has anyone said Shibu
6606000	6608000	said she wants to try a G-mod?
6608000	6610000	Oh my god, I need to buy the thing.
6610000	6612000	I need to buy the game for real, for real.
6613000	6614000	Bye-bye-poo-ah!
6614000	6615000	Thanks for hanging.
6615000	6617000	Thanks for completing the puzzle with this as well.
6617000	6618000	It was fun.
6618000	6619000	Please do a puzzle stream
6619000	6621000	and link inside your art of your stuff.
6621000	6622000	Your content is so fun.
6622000	6624000	I so recommend it.
6626000	6629000	Oh yeah, I really want to see the beat of a prop one.
6629000	6630000	I already,
6630000	6633000	I hate the feeling of being chased,
6633000	6635000	and I already know I'm going to be screaming
6635000	6637000	and excitement being chased,
6637000	6639000	but if I'm like hating as a prop
6639000	6641000	and like one of them susses me out,
6641000	6643000	thank you for always being so nice and comfy to watch.
6643000	6646000	Oh thank you for, what the heck, that's so kind.
6647000	6649000	I've returned the compliments to you.
6650000	6652000	You're always a cozy streamer too.
6653000	6654000	I saw your post on Twitter
6654000	6656000	with all your nickel variations and that,
6656000	6658000	and I was like, damn, you got some,
6658000	6660000	some alternatives.
6660000	6662000	You got loads of stuff that you can do, which is fantastic.
6663000	6665000	Mum is screaming because of us.
6665000	6667000	No, I'm not screaming.
6667000	6669000	But the feeling of being chased
6669000	6671000	gets me like so excited and giddy,
6671000	6674000	and if one of the girls was chasing me in Gmodor,
6674000	6675000	they know I'll be like,
6675000	6677000	like I'll be like burst out laughing
6677000	6680000	because I get nervous laughter with chasing as well.
6680000	6681000	I don't know,
6681000	6683000	there's just something like primal in me
6683000	6685000	that gets activated.
6685000	6686000	Sorry, the red hue,
6686000	6689000	I just realized how awkward the red hue is making this.
6689000	6690000	There's so much red hue.
6691000	6693000	Actually, for an ASMR I'm working on,
6693000	6694000	it's gonna be interesting.
6696000	6698000	ASMR, you say?
6698000	6700000	3DO, you say?
6700000	6702000	Is that a collab on the horizon?
6702000	6704000	No one will know.
6704000	6706000	Teasing, teasing.
6706000	6708000	Mummy, you should look into primal play.
6708000	6709000	Wait, is that a thing?
6709000	6711000	Stop, hold on.
6712000	6714000	Am I about to get educated?
6715000	6717000	Primal play.
6717000	6719000	Primal play centers around the raw feeling
6719000	6721000	and actions and natural impulses,
6721000	6723000	especially urges.
6723000	6726000	And while I understand you are the sub in...
6726000	6727000	What?
6728000	6730000	Oh, this is like an article.
6731000	6734000	Some people who do primal play switch roles
6734000	6735000	and chase them instead.
6735000	6736000	What the fuck?
6737000	6738000	Mummy's a primal play girl.
6738000	6740000	Stop, is that what I am?
6740000	6741000	I just want something new.
6741000	6742000	What do you think?
6742000	6744000	Drawing Gen 2 suggestions.
6744000	6746000	No slime girls!
6747000	6749000	No, who said 3DO, that's gonna...
6749000	6752000	I mean, you know, I could just teach me how to do it professionally.
6752000	6754000	Oh no!
6754000	6756000	Alright, I'll hit you up in the DMs boob and grill them
6756000	6758000	where I got you.
6758000	6759000	And Neko this.
6759000	6761000	Neko needs...
6761000	6763000	Neko needs pamper you to sleep.
6763000	6765000	Gotta make it rain.
6765000	6766000	Over like a window.
6766000	6771000	Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
6773000	6775000	Viscous liquids girl.
6776000	6777000	She smells fresh meat.
6777000	6778000	Article trying to call it.
6778000	6780000	Literally, I typed in primal prey.
6781000	6783000	Can I speak here anymore?
6783000	6785000	Insight girl and goblin girls?
6785000	6786000	There's a lot of bang girls.
6786000	6788000	You can ask for what you want.
6788000	6790000	I will actually force myself to draw it.
6790000	6791000	You're welcome.
6791000	6793000	Yeah, the DVD screensaver.
6793000	6795000	Artificial sea war girl, what does it mean?
6795000	6797000	Right, I'm hiding it, I'm hiding it.
6797000	6799000	Right, next thumbnail.
6799000	6802000	After slime girls, I've completely forgotten.
6802000	6806000	Oh, I'm educating you in my special interests.
6806000	6808000	Which you're not ready for.
6808000	6811000	Which I'm gonna have so much fun making.
6811000	6813000	Like I need to do like a big powerpoint presentation.
6813000	6815000	That stream is gonna be so long.
6815000	6818000	If I get carried away, that stream's gonna be so long.
6818000	6820000	Okay, next one.
6823000	6826000	Making her successors in Gen 2.
6826000	6829000	The goblino reefling girl.
6829000	6832000	A reefling girl version?
6832000	6835000	I feel like you guys are a reflection of me though.
6836000	6839000	I was gonna get a model update so I can lift up my bangs,
6839000	6843000	my fringe, and then reveal the nicotine patch on my head as well.
6843000	6845000	I love strony calls, I love strony calls.
6845000	6847000	Thank you, I love reefling.
6847000	6848000	Cuddles.
6848000	6850000	Cause that's your surname.
6850000	6852000	Strony, what kind of...
6852000	6854000	No, my autistic special interests.
6854000	6856000	Not those kind, not those kind of special interests.
6856000	6858000	The autism kind.
6858000	6860000	I'm gonna talk about seat dispersal.
6860000	6864000	I'm gonna talk about digestive tract.
6864000	6868000	I'm gonna talk about
6868000	6871000	socialization.
6871000	6877000	I'm going to talk about what life was like before capitalism.
6877000	6880000	I'm gonna talk about region locked capitalism,
6880000	6882000	which is feudalism.
6882000	6883000	I can never say it right.
6883000	6886000	I'm also gonna talk about Freud.
6886000	6890000	You know, because he was kind of right
6890000	6893000	and people shunned him.
6893000	6899000	I'm gonna talk about what mother's special interests are.
6899000	6902000	The other special kinds are in a different stream.
6902000	6905000	Feudalism, that's a feudalism.
6905000	6907000	What kind of seats?
6907000	6909000	I'm gonna teach you about seats in general,
6909000	6910000	so you can learn.
6910000	6912000	I'm gonna teach you about how farming works
6912000	6914000	and agriculture and that kind of thing.
6914000	6918000	Freud was ahead of his time, honestly.
6918000	6921000	That man was onto something and they shunned him
6921000	6925000	all because he had a cocaine addiction, okay?
6925000	6927000	What else are we gonna talk about?
6927000	6930000	Probably
6930000	6934000	world war accounts.
6934000	6938000	Some information that you might not have known.
6938000	6941000	I'm gonna talk about the farming.
6941000	6944000	How farming at home has disappeared.
6944000	6947000	Planting at home and growing your own veggies
6947000	6950000	at home has disappeared.
6950000	6953000	More like Sigma Freud.
6953000	6954000	Sigma, I mean.
6954000	6957000	Freud had a big speech on how he took coke before
6957000	6960000	and then the only thing that mattered was he seemed smart.
6960000	6962000	Well, cocaine gives...
6962000	6964000	Oh, I really like drugs as well.
6964000	6966000	No, I don't take them.
6966000	6970000	I'm interested in the effects they have in the addiction
6970000	6975000	and the social perception of addicts.
6975000	6978000	Now, this is a conversation for the stream,
6978000	6980000	but I will touch on it now.
6980000	6982000	So, you know when someone says,
6982000	6984000	oh, that person's so addicted
6984000	6987000	that they couldn't give up the drugs for their kids
6987000	6990000	and then they're like, oh, that's disgusting, XYZ.
6990000	6992000	No, motherfucker.
6992000	6996000	That shows you how unbelievably,
6996000	7001000	like, the grip that the narcotics has on that person,
7001000	7003000	it shows you they have...
7003000	7005000	They are unable to reason.
7005000	7008000	It shows you how strong and dependent their body is
7008000	7010000	on this substance, motherfucker.
7010000	7012000	Listen up!
7012000	7014000	That's not how it works.
7014000	7017000	Literally, people be like, oh, she couldn't beat...
7017000	7020000	Like, you know, when you hear stories like, oh, he couldn't beat the addiction.
7020000	7024000	She couldn't beat the addiction for, like, his son, her son or whatever.
7024000	7026000	Oh, they're weaker-weaver.
7026000	7028000	No!
7028000	7032000	That shows how un-the-vice-like grip
7032000	7036000	that does not even give them an inch to breathe
7036000	7038000	that the narcotics has on them.
7038000	7041000	But anyway, I'm gonna get into that conversation
7041000	7043000	in my special interests.
7043000	7045000	So yeah, you're getting galaxy brain
7045000	7048000	because you're getting educated in my special interests.
7048000	7050000	What if we're addicted to you?
7050000	7054000	Um, hopefully I'm not detrimental to your health.
7054000	7055000	I hope anyway.
7055000	7057000	But look, it's me!
7057000	7059000	Hey, listen!
7059000	7061000	Listen to my special interests.
7061000	7063000	You will get to hear them all.
7063000	7064000	Where are you going?
7064000	7068000	You're wiggling away like a little worm.
7068000	7070000	Mmm.
7070000	7075000	But yes, I also talk about how to reverse, like, the effects of addiction
7075000	7077000	and how it should actually work and, like, how you do it.
7077000	7078000	Good night, mommy.
7078000	7079000	Gonna ink and go to sleep.
7079000	7081000	I love your honesty, Reefling.
7081000	7083000	Have an amazing inking session.
7083000	7087000	Please remember to say my name when you ink, okay?
7087000	7088000	Just a little stronger.
7088000	7089000	Okay, that'll do me.
7089000	7090000	Thank you.
7090000	7091000	Thank you. Good night.
7091000	7092000	Okay.
7092000	7093000	How many...
7093000	7095000	Wait, have I spelled it wrong?
7095000	7102000	Get educated in my special interests.
7102000	7103000	Oh.
7104000	7105000	Oops.
7105000	7107000	Should I leave it in?
7107000	7108000	Should I leave it in?
7108000	7113000	Because it makes it more like me?
7113000	7114000	Me.
7114000	7115000	Okay.
7115000	7116000	Next thumbnail.
7116000	7117000	Right.
7117000	7121000	So then after you've been educated in my special interests, Reefling,
7121000	7122000	next, we are...
7122000	7124000	I actually don't know what we're playing.
7124000	7125000	Hold on.
7125000	7126000	Let me pull up my whole thing.
7126000	7128000	We're playing supermarket simulator.
7128000	7131000	That might get exchanged if I am dumb.
7131000	7135000	And it's apparently a long game, which I had no idea about.
7135000	7136000	Oopsies.
7136000	7137000	That was a mistake.
7137000	7138000	Genuine mistake.
7138000	7140000	It was a mistake.
7140000	7142000	It was a mis-input.
7142000	7143000	Mis-input.
7143000	7144000	Puzzle.
7144000	7145000	Secret puzzle.
7145000	7146000	Secret puzzle.
7146000	7147000	Revealing my thumbnail.
7147000	7148000	Secret, secret, secret, secret puzzle.
7148000	7149000	Wait.
7149000	7150000	Where are you doing a collab with Azura?
7150000	7151000	I am.
7151000	7163000	But you're not seeing the thumbnail yet.
7163000	7165000	It's a secret.
7165000	7168000	So this is my supermarket thumbnail.
7168000	7171000	No, you guys honing in on the text.
7171000	7173000	You guys are so smart.
7173000	7175000	They're like going straight for the text first.
7175000	7177000	That's so wise.
7177000	7180000	This is a really cool way to post your schedule.
7180000	7181000	Yeah.
7181000	7185000	I think I'll do a puzzle stream again maybe once I've got more behind the scenes art
7185000	7190000	work and stuff to show off because I think it's quite exciting doing it that way.
7190000	7192000	So I'll need to get ordering.
7192000	7193000	Chop, chop, scrawny.
7193000	7195000	Get ordering some more things.
7195000	7197000	So I gave my lecture to date.
7197000	7202000	Despite my lack of preparation, I spoke well and I ascribed to the cocaine I had taken
7202000	7203000	before and I told.
7203000	7208000	So cocaine is really interesting because it gives you an ego.
7208000	7213000	I know that sounds crazy because you know, you know people that are unconfident, you
7213000	7216000	know, we've all experienced something like that.
7216000	7217000	A mis-input.
7217000	7220000	I'm going to, I'm going to put something in this mess.
7220000	7221000	All right.
7221000	7222000	Okay.
7222000	7223000	That's actually really good.
7223000	7227000	You get, you have been awarded the comment of the day.
7227000	7228000	Congrats.
7228000	7230000	That was actually a really good comment.
7230000	7232000	I know I sound so sarcastic.
7232000	7234000	It's so funny that I can't laugh.
7234000	7235000	It's that good.
7235000	7236000	Okay.
7236000	7237000	What was I saying?
7237000	7238000	Oh cocaine.
7238000	7239000	It gives you an ego.
7239000	7244000	So when you're unconfident, often you will hear things such as, oh, you know, fake it
7244000	7245000	until you make it.
7245000	7247000	Say positive affirmations to yourself.
7247000	7251000	The substance cocaine gives you an ego.
7251000	7254000	It is the most bizarre side effect.
7254000	7255000	Truly.
7255000	7257000	Sam, thank you for the rose.
7257000	7260000	Why is your profile picture a pan?
7260000	7262000	Wait, that's not even a pan.
7262000	7263000	That's a walk.
7263000	7265000	Why is your profile picture a walk?
7265000	7266000	That's so specific.
7266000	7268000	Thank you, Sam, for the rose.
7268000	7270000	You're giving me flowers.
7270000	7274000	I appreciate.
7274000	7275000	Are we super chats?
7275000	7276000	I won't call it super chat.
7276000	7277000	There we go.
7277000	7280000	The booger sugar, honestly.
7280000	7282000	Freud was kind of cute, but it was a bit too much.
7282000	7283000	It was a bit much.
7283000	7284000	He did.
7284000	7287000	I think he did a really messed up experiment with someone's kids at one point.
7287000	7289000	And I was like, oh, Freud, steady on.
7289000	7291000	It's a skillet.
7291000	7293000	Isn't that a walk?
7293000	7295000	Oh, sorry.
7295000	7307000	He did.
7307000	7311000	And a lot of times the thing's not really scientific.
7311000	7313000	Yeah, I think there's a lot of things with Freud.
7313000	7314000	I'll do a deep dive.
7314000	7322000	I might also talk about Guy Fox because on the 5th of November, a guy called Guy Fox.
7322000	7324000	Yeah, his name was literally Guy.
7324000	7331000	He planned to blow up parliament on the 5th of November, but his plot got foiled.
7331000	7339000	So on the 5th of November, the UK set of fireworks for it.
7339000	7350000	But England celebrate it because his plot got foiled, but Scotland celebrate it because they...
7350000	7356000	Yeah, you know what I'm trying to say, right?
7356000	7360000	So fireworks on the 5th of November in Scotland.
7360000	7364000	Yeah, we were rooting for him.
7364000	7368000	He had the right idea.
7368000	7371000	It's a memorial day in Scotland that day for funny reasons.
7371000	7374000	For me, it ends up being microbiology and diseases.
7374000	7376000	Ooh, I could talk about diagnoses.
7376000	7378000	I quite like them too.
7379000	7386000	The only problem when you talk about diagnoses, especially when it's genetic disorders or whatever,
7386000	7389000	I don't want to use actual pictures of people because that's not very nice.
7389000	7395000	Maybe I can get medical drawings to be respectful to the identity.
7400000	7406000	I can at least forget Freud because he was the one of the early researchers in the field that was prey.
7406000	7408000	This is my supermarket simulator.
7408000	7410000	I say, bag your own shite.
7410000	7413000	So, I'm going to tell you one thing I don't like about you Aussies.
7413000	7415000	Ooh, that's right, Australians.
7415000	7418000	I'm calling you out at 6am in the morning.
7418000	7424000	No, the Australian etiquette is you do not bag your own items.
7424000	7426000	In Scotland, you bag your...
7426000	7428000	Put scrawny in the bag.
7428000	7432000	In Scotland, you bag your own items.
7432000	7437000	When I came to Australia and saw that people do not bag their own items,
7437000	7439000	I was mortified.
7439000	7444000	I watched the most impatient woman ever get her stuff bagged.
7444000	7445000	And I'm like...
7445000	7447000	And she was like, can you hurry up?
7447000	7448000	I'm on a time crunch.
7448000	7451000	And I'm like, just if you...
7451000	7459000	If you bagged it yourself, you would already be in your car driving away to your house.
7459000	7460000	Okay?
7460000	7461000	Are you squinting me right now?
7461000	7462000	Reflin for a month.
7462000	7469000	Thank you, little kawakami for the extended membership.
7469000	7471000	I appreciate it.
7471000	7472000	You're doing it.
7472000	7474000	Right, what comes after?
7474000	7475000	Keep forgetting my schedule.
7475000	7478000	As if I'm not the one who freaking made it.
7478000	7481000	And...
7481000	7482000	I'm doing ring fit.
7482000	7483000	Right, ring fit next.
7483000	7485000	Okay, this is a bit of a...
7485000	7488000	It's rather familiar, so don't be too surprised if you recognize it.
7489000	7492000	It's not much of a different layout, okay?
7492000	7493000	I confess.
7493000	7495000	I must confess.
7495000	7497000	I still believe.
7497000	7499000	Still believe.
7499000	7504000	Right, one more, one more, one more.
7504000	7505000	Oh.
7505000	7509000	Oh, okay, that was a little bit...
7509000	7510000	One more.
7510000	7513000	Thank you for the extended membership again.
7513000	7514000	Ritto!
7514000	7516000	I probably said your name horrifically wrong.
7516000	7519000	Bro, that was one thing about that collab stream with the girls.
7519000	7521000	I was saying everyone's name wrong.
7521000	7523000	Like horrifically wrong.
7525000	7527000	Bags are cashier exclusive where I live.
7527000	7529000	The bag, the stuff, I'll scan it.
7529000	7530000	Yeah.
7530000	7533000	It's a different everywhere, but I bag my own stuff.
7533000	7535000	Thank you, ladrian.
7535000	7538000	You sound like an elf from Lord of the Rings.
7538000	7539000	Ladrian.
7539000	7541000	Thank you for becoming a member.
7541000	7543000	I appreciate it.
7544000	7548000	Yeah, I bring a backpack, so I pack my own stuff.
7548000	7551000	And whenever I say to the person that's attending me,
7551000	7554000	I'm always like, oh, good morning.
7554000	7556000	I'm just going to pack it myself.
7556000	7558000	They're always like, oh, thank you so much, dear.
7558000	7560000	And I'm like, ooh.
7560000	7564000	And then I always explain, yeah, in Scotland you do it yourself.
7564000	7567000	Now, you can't ask for help in Scotland.
7567000	7568000	Don't get me wrong.
7568000	7571000	But if you want to be in and out of that shop,
7571000	7576000	as quick as can be, then I want more of the collab stream.
7576000	7577000	It was so funny and cute.
7577000	7579000	Well, let's review another girl.
7579000	7582000	I think we're probably going to do a tier list,
7582000	7584000	like an actual tier list at some point.
7584000	7588000	Now, and before fucking VTubers get their feelings hurt
7588000	7590000	because we're actually ranking them,
7590000	7593000	I'll do a meme-y to you, a bit of a meme side, OK?
7593000	7595000	And it would be like, would slap in between your thighs,
7595000	7598000	would lick them or something like that,
7598000	7602000	would put like chocolate cake on them or something.
7602000	7604000	I just want all the girls together.
7604000	7606000	Aw, you like when we hang out together?
7606000	7607000	I find it so fun.
7607000	7610000	I already know what the collab is in August,
7610000	7613000	but I'm not going to tell you because it's inside your secrets.
7613000	7617000	You're not allowed to know what the collab is in August.
7617000	7618000	Howdy.
7618000	7620000	Hi, Evelyn.
7620000	7622000	We're currently doing puzzles
7622000	7626000	and I'm making you unlock my thumbnails for the week via puzzles.
7626000	7627000	I love Stony Cuddles.
7627000	7630000	I love, I love Evelyn Cuddles.
7630000	7632000	Alright, keep your secrets, honestly.
7632000	7635000	Alright, then keep your secrets.
7635000	7638000	Was actually my night elf, George's name and wow.
7638000	7641000	Ah, and I told you it was Elvin.
7641000	7643000	And the USA.
7643000	7644000	I don't know.
7644000	7645000	Brian.
7645000	7647000	In the USA, if you want to bag your own stuff,
7647000	7649000	you just use self-checkout machine.
7649000	7651000	Same if you have social anxiety.
7651000	7653000	Ah, that's cool.
7653000	7654000	I like that sound.
7654000	7657000	Are you squinting me right now?
7657000	7659000	Uh,
7659000	7661000	Maurizio.
7661000	7664000	Did you forget to send a message?
7664000	7666000	You could have typed in that super chat.
7666000	7669000	Thank you for giving me your super chat, Cherry.
7669000	7671000	Right now.
7671000	7673000	How did I say that?
7673000	7677000	Maurizio Rosetti.
7677000	7679000	Okay, I can say that part good.
7679000	7680000	Thank you for the super chat.
7680000	7681000	I appreciate it.
7681000	7682000	And Sam too.
7682000	7684000	You know, there's self-checkout,
7684000	7686000	and if you want to do your own thing,
7686000	7688000	you can use self-checkout,
7688000	7690000	but it depends how much I've got,
7690000	7692000	but I put everything in my backpack,
7692000	7694000	because I rate a bake.
7694000	7698000	What are you doing?
7698000	7700000	Alright, this is the first time I think USA
7700000	7702000	have a good thing going,
7702000	7703000	sweaty mummy.
7703000	7705000	I hope you're ready for it,
7705000	7708000	because I'm going to be a load of anything.
7708000	7710000	I'm digging the background music.
7710000	7715000	It is a Lo-Fi Elden Ring?
7715000	7716000	No.
7716000	7718000	Legend of Zelda non-copyright.
7718000	7719000	Ta-da!
7719000	7721000	Ring Fito Avento de...
7721000	7722000	Where did it go?
7722000	7723000	Where did it go?
7723000	7724000	I didn't find myself.
7724000	7725000	But that's it.
7725000	7727000	And look at my heart rate.
7727000	7729000	It's 1,380.
7729000	7731000	Oh no, it's 138 beats per minute.
7731000	7732000	I'm at the last.
7732000	7735000	I was like, how, 1,388?
7735000	7737000	No, 138.
7737000	7739000	I have no idea what my heart rate max
7739000	7740000	is going to be on the stream,
7740000	7741000	but we'll find out together.
7741000	7745000	Mummy in those thighs makes me want to ink.
7745000	7747000	Steady on.
7747000	7749000	Copyright Lo-Fi Zelda beats to make puzzles.
7749000	7750000	No, not copyright.
7750000	7751000	Non-copyright.
7751000	7752000	Non-copyright.
7752000	7753000	Non-copyright.
7753000	7754000	No copyright, okay?
7754000	7755000	Please don't perish from the heart rate.
7755000	7758000	No, I will look after myself.
7758000	7759000	Gamer chop.
7759000	7761000	My resting heart rate is like 90 and 100.
7761000	7764000	Damn, are you me?
7764000	7765000	But yeah.
7765000	7766000	Mummy looks cute in that outfit.
7766000	7767000	You like it?
7767000	7768000	You like my little headband?
7768000	7770000	I need to stick on her.
7770000	7772000	I like the way you do.
7772000	7774000	I'm like, there, there.
7774000	7776000	There's thighs though.
7776000	7778000	Okay, how many more thumbnails do we got?
7778000	7779000	Will it do a fit?
7779000	7780000	Right.
7780000	7785000	I will challenge you to 150 to see how unbelievably easy it is.
7785000	7788000	Eh, who is next?
7788000	7789000	Sakura game.
7789000	7790000	Okay.
7790000	7791000	Oh, this is ridiculous.
7791000	7794000	This is going to take like no time at all.
7794000	7798000	As long as you guys are having fun though, that's all that matters.
7798000	7799000	Right.
7799000	7800000	I need to lake.
7800000	7803000	I don't even think I'm going to have time to pin this.
7803000	7804000	Are you ready?
7804000	7805000	Okay, boom.
7805000	7808000	I don't even think I have time to pin it before you guys finish it.
7808000	7809000	There we go.
7809000	7810000	Replace pin.
7810000	7815000	Yeah, this is what 50 pieces is.
7815000	7823000	This is Suika and not Tsukiyo.
7823000	7831000	No, this is too quick.
7831000	7839000	I am Watamera.
7839000	7840000	Mummy's Melons.
7840000	7842000	Would you play with Mummy's Melons?
7843000	7844000	There you say.
7844000	7845000	You did it.
7845000	7846000	Replay.
7846000	7847000	Oh, almost.
7847000	7848000	Oh, we're getting edged.
7848000	7851000	We're getting edged with an edge piece.
7851000	7852000	Coco Melon.
7852000	7853000	No.
7853000	7854000	There you go.
7854000	7855000	Tsukiyo.
7855000	7856000	One big stretch.
7856000	7857000	Tsukiyo.
7857000	7858000	Wow.
7858000	7859000	Okay.
7859000	7860000	I switched.
7860000	7862000	I'm jumping up and down.
7862000	7863000	Boing.
7863000	7864000	I'm up on the top corner.
7864000	7865000	I'm down on the top corner.
7865000	7866000	I'm up again.
7866000	7867000	I'm down.
7867000	7870000	I'm hovering over gently in the middle.
7870000	7871000	Oh, I'm in the other corner.
7871000	7872000	What am I going to do?
7872000	7873000	Oh.
7873000	7874000	Oh.
7874000	7875000	Oh, I'm jumping in them.
7875000	7877000	I am diagonal out here.
7877000	7881000	Call me Diagon because I'm Diagon Alley Moving.
7881000	7883000	That's absolutely awful.
7883000	7885000	You won the last one to be a thousand pieces.
7885000	7887000	I don't even think something else is that good.
7887000	7891000	If you want it to be a thousand pieces, sure.
7891000	7894000	I'll do as you command my refling.
7894000	7898000	Your wish is my command, truly.
7898000	7899000	Okay.
7899000	7901000	Next we have Azura collab.
7901000	7902000	Okay.
7902000	7903000	Thumbnail.
7903000	7905000	A thousand pieces and random rotation.
7905000	7908000	Are you mad?
7908000	7909000	Okay.
7909000	7910000	How about next time?
7910000	7911000	No.
7911000	7912000	Maybe we wouldn't do it this time.
7912000	7916000	How about next time we do...
7916000	7918000	What does that say?
7918000	7919000	Azura.
7919000	7920000	Azura.
7920000	7921000	Azura.
7921000	7922000	Azura.
7922000	7931000	The servers are like pleased for the love of God.
7931000	7932000	Oh, Azura.
7932000	7933000	What the heck?
7933000	7935000	Oh, we're doing a call.
7935000	7940000	I'm making the reflings see the thumbnails via puzzles on stream.
7940000	7944000	I know it sounds crazy, but it's true.
7944000	7946000	I'm putting them to work.
7946000	7947000	Hi, Azura.
7947000	7948000	Azura, you have not slept.
7948000	7954000	I have not slept, so I know for a fact you have not slept.
7954000	7955000	Bad gateway.
7955000	7956000	Is this the wrong link?
7956000	7960000	I was secretly doing the two other puzzles, were you?
7960000	7962000	Azura, you have not slept at all.
7962000	7964000	You did such a long stream.
7964000	7965000	I don't even know when you went to bed.
7965000	7969000	I went to bed and I think you still kept going.
7969000	7972000	It worked, but we overloaded it for a second.
7972000	7976000	I love refling cuddles.
7976000	7977000	16 hours of league.
7977000	7980000	You broke the vod and then some.
7980000	7981000	Jesus.
7981000	7983000	I took a three hour nap.
7983000	7986000	You are going to be perishing during the Yumi Plus concert.
7986000	7988000	You know that, right?
7988000	7993000	You're going to be a piddle, a little piddle on the floor.
7993000	7995000	You're not going to make it.
7995000	7998000	This is me and Azura's thumbnail.
7998000	8000000	Azura and I, sorry.
8000000	8002000	It's not me and person.
8003000	8007000	Person and I is the proper English.
8007000	8009000	Sorry, I know it bothers some people.
8009000	8010000	I apologize.
8010000	8012000	I was raised in a barn, okay?
8012000	8015000	I don't know your customs and your ways.
8015000	8017000	Can I drink her?
8017000	8020000	Well, if she melted into a puddle.
8020000	8022000	I mean, if you want.
8022000	8025000	The pot's kind of calling the kettle black, here's the lures.
8025000	8027000	No!
8027000	8030000	I don't get sleep because...
8031000	8033000	Well, yeah.
8033000	8034000	Okay.
8034000	8035000	You know what?
8035000	8036000	Sometimes you're right, Riflin.
8036000	8039000	Sometimes you're maybe on to something.
8039000	8043000	I want scrawny curls to R word me so I can cry in the shower afterwards.
8043000	8044000	Hang on.
8044000	8047000	I don't think you can say that.
8047000	8050000	Before anyone says where did I spawn that from?
8050000	8051000	It's in the chat.
8051000	8052000	It's right there.
8052000	8056000	Before anyone says where did that spawn from?
8056000	8057000	Hang on.
8057000	8060000	You can say that, I lied.
8060000	8061000	Real?
8061000	8063000	No, you're not supposed to agree.
8063000	8064000	Why?
8064000	8065000	No.
8065000	8066000	Why would you cry?
8066000	8071000	He did, so it must be legal.
8071000	8073000	Twilight Princess music?
8073000	8076000	Yeah, you have good ears.
8076000	8078000	That Riflin speaks the truth.
8078000	8079000	Cry?
8079000	8081000	Cry because it's over?
8081000	8083000	So, baby?
8083000	8085000	When it comes to using me or I,
8085000	8088000	you just have to remove the other person from the sentence
8088000	8091000	and whichever one sounds natural is correct.
8091000	8092000	I don't know.
8092000	8093000	What?
8093000	8094000	Tiny Spiny?
8094000	8095000	What?
8095000	8096000	Thank you for the tip.
8096000	8097000	Are you sure?
8097000	8101000	No, because it's like Azura and I are playing...
8101000	8104000	We were here.
8104000	8106000	I...
8106000	8107000	Hmm.
8107000	8108000	What?
8108000	8110000	We only cry because we stopped.
8110000	8113000	You think the devs read this at any point?
8113000	8116000	They're currently looking up what Strony Cuddles is
8116000	8120000	and they're being introduced to the world of V-Tubing.
8120000	8123000	Love my cuddlefish wife.
8123000	8126000	Aww, such a cute nickname.
8126000	8130000	I just want Strony Cuddles hugs her peak.
8130000	8132000	Yeah, so this is the thumbnail.
8132000	8134000	I've colour-coordinated it.
8134000	8137000	It looks green, orange, like my hair,
8137000	8139000	and then blue and purple.
8139000	8141000	Someone said Azura's hair is green,
8141000	8145000	but it's like a teal blue, is it not?
8145000	8146000	That Strony lover?
8146000	8150000	Me, for real, for real.
8150000	8151000	Why are you booing him?
8151000	8153000	He's right.
8153000	8155000	They probably have a bunch of resource usage
8155000	8157000	and they'll check later and wonder.
8157000	8159000	It's Meku colour.
8159000	8162000	So it's blue, right?
8162000	8164000	It looks cyan to me.
8164000	8165000	Is cyan blue?
8165000	8166000	It's definitely not teal.
8166000	8168000	Well, people were saying her hair was green
8168000	8171000	and I'm like, no, my hair is green.
8171000	8173000	Closer to green than blue?
8173000	8175000	I don't...
8175000	8176000	I see blue.
8176000	8177000	I see blue.
8177000	8178000	I see blue.
8178000	8180000	I see blue.
8180000	8182000	That was my old account, by the way.
8182000	8185000	All of that, me, for real.
8185000	8186000	Oh, shit.
8186000	8188000	I think we're timing it.
8188000	8192000	I think I broke the servers.
8192000	8193000	I think I broke the servers.
8193000	8195000	Hold on.
8195000	8196000	Wait, no.
8196000	8198000	Is it still...
8198000	8199000	Am I going crazy?
8199000	8200000	I thought this one.
8200000	8202000	It's like a sea foam green.
8202000	8203000	Sea foam blue?
8203000	8205000	Yeah, I thought it was blue.
8205000	8206000	I don't know.
8206000	8207000	Maybe it's my eyes.
8207000	8209000	But like, if you look at me, you can be like,
8209000	8211000	yeah, Strony's got green in her hair.
8211000	8213000	But if you look at Azura, it's like,
8213000	8217000	she's a kind of a blue-purple palette.
8217000	8218000	I want the Vealer Girls...
8218000	8219000	The R word, me.
8219000	8222000	Reflames!
8222000	8224000	You want us to run a train on you?
8224000	8227000	One by one.
8227000	8230000	Or we'll just take a plop at a time.
8230000	8231000	That's terrible.
8231000	8232000	I shouldn't encourage it.
8232000	8233000	I'm encouraging it.
8233000	8234000	I shouldn't.
8234000	8235000	I shouldn't.
8235000	8237000	It looks close to Aquamarine.
8237000	8239000	Aquamines blue water.
8239000	8241000	So, surely.
8241000	8243000	Surely.
8243000	8246000	Okay, and then after we've done Azura's stream,
8246000	8249000	we have Drumroll, please.
8249000	8253000	Mario Kart, which I am going to add you guys into it
8253000	8256000	because it's not got you in it,
8256000	8257000	which I don't like.
8257000	8258000	I want you in it.
8264000	8265000	Nope.
8265000	8266000	That didn't work.
8266000	8269000	That did work, however.
8269000	8270000	Puddle!
8270000	8272000	This is the second-last one,
8272000	8274000	and then I'm going off and redirecting.
8274000	8276000	I'm slightly blue-colorblind,
8276000	8277000	so I don't know, a fuck room.
8277000	8280000	We're as bad as each other right now, god damn!
8281000	8283000	Now, this is Mario Kart.
8283000	8285000	Are you squidding me right now?
8285000	8286000	Broly legend.
8286000	8289000	So, Strongly does the carpet match the drapes.
8289000	8291000	No, there's no carpet.
8291000	8292000	Oh, here.
8292000	8293000	Oh, wait, no.
8293000	8294000	It's carpet in my head.
8294000	8295000	No.
8295000	8296000	Yeah.
8296000	8297000	Wait, I get so confused.
8297000	8299000	This is an American term.
8299000	8302000	What does it mean again?
8302000	8307000	Carpet is below because curtains are above.
8307000	8308000	Right.
8308000	8309000	No, it doesn't.
8309000	8312000	I don't have anything.
8312000	8313000	Carpet's other one.
8313000	8314000	Sorry.
8314000	8316000	It's like an American sentence,
8316000	8321000	and I'd never hear it until I entered the internet.
8321000	8323000	Shocking, baby.
8323000	8326000	Are you posting it again, Anon in the chat?
8326000	8328000	I can see it right above me.
8328000	8332000	Orange Anon will call you because your text name is orange.
8332000	8334000	Love, Strongly cuttles, do I?
8334000	8336000	I do.
8336000	8337000	Love me, cuttles.
8337000	8339000	Love me, cuttlefish.
8339000	8341000	Love me.
8341000	8343000	Love me, Momay.
8343000	8345000	Love me, Dominatrix.
8345000	8347000	Love me, Yandere.
8347000	8351000	Love me, little sister.
8351000	8353000	And love me.
8353000	8354000	What was it?
8354000	8355000	Mezugaki.
8355000	8357000	Kuzugaki.
8357000	8359000	My Bratipolar mirror.
8359000	8360000	My Bratiprincess.
8360000	8361000	Is she your princess?
8361000	8362000	Is that that?
8362000	8364000	I see princess now.
8364000	8368000	Instead of Brat.
8368000	8371000	Thank you for the tip, frilly legend.
8371000	8373000	Well, speaking of wax,
8373000	8376000	you'll never guess what one of my Donathon rewards are.
8376000	8378000	Wahoo!
8378000	8380000	Himagaki.
8380000	8387000	No, kuzugaki means like shit-talking brat.
8387000	8389000	No way.
8389000	8390000	Yeah.
8390000	8393000	I was going to go to a parlor.
8393000	8398000	That would wax me and give me permission to record the audio.
8398000	8406000	I'm obviously going to tip the girl because not only does she have to look at my clam,
8406000	8413000	if you didn't know, when you get a Brazilian wax, you also have to present your derriere as well.
8413000	8416000	They do your derriere.
8416000	8419000	So I think I have to literally bend over on this table.
8419000	8421000	I don't know what's going to happen,
8421000	8426000	but I'm going to ask permission to record it for a Donathon reward if we reach it.
8426000	8430000	So that would be a very interesting audio to put out there.
8430000	8434000	Once again, I misunderstood when you said record.
8434000	8436000	It's going to be great.
8436000	8439000	I'd literally be like, wah!
8439000	8441000	I have no idea what it's going to be like.
8441000	8445000	Apparently it's super painful though, like the first time.
8445000	8447000	No, I'm not going to bring the 3D.
8447000	8449000	Oh, I'm going to freak her out with that thing.
8450000	8454000	The audio, not the visuals.
8454000	8457000	The audio.
8457000	8459000	Good thing I can do this puzzle one-handed.
8459000	8461000	Stop! No!
8467000	8469000	How can it not be painful?
8469000	8477000	Well, they say if you do it over time, it's not as painful like it isn't sore as sore.
8477000	8479000	The audio is more than enough.
8479000	8481000	Stop! That's terrible.
8481000	8487000	They say the more you do it, the easier it is for the hairs to be pulled out from the root,
8487000	8489000	because that's what you're doing when you wax.
8489000	8491000	You're pulling it from the root.
8491000	8495000	But the first time you do it will always be the most painful.
8495000	8498000	So I'm rather nervous, I'm going to be honest,
8498000	8505000	but I was going to get like a full wax like my legs, my armpits,
8505000	8508000	and then my clam and all that.
8508000	8511000	So I don't know how long the audio is going to be,
8511000	8514000	but I think it's literally going to be me going like...
8519000	8523000	So over time, you get an iron clam.
8523000	8526000	No! You're upgrading my clam.
8528000	8531000	Also, can you post pictures afterwards?
8531000	8535000	What? You want to see my hairy armpit before and then after?
8535000	8538000	I don't think that's very cheeky.
8539000	8542000	I maybe do a cheeky armpit picture, I don't know.
8542000	8544000	I'd be kind of down for that.
8544000	8552000	I was going to do a foot photo shoot where I do every interest for imaginable,
8552000	8559000	like wrinkly foot, oiled up, dirt outside, spread toes.
8559000	8565000	Like I was going to do a mega collage of everything and anything you could have wanted.
8565000	8570000	Like of, I don't know, more about the taco and the peach for me.
8570000	8573000	No! I'm putting them in a picture of a peach.
8573000	8575000	Well the more you do it the rarer it gets.
8575000	8579000	Imagine an adamantium clam.
8579000	8580000	It's so op.
8580000	8582000	It's a bit, don't ask them that.
8582000	8584000	They're going to say yeah.
8585000	8587000	My poor reflex.
8588000	8591000	Can that be considered a tazadivel?
8591000	8593000	Waxing speaks to me because it ingrown hairs.
8593000	8595000	Post pics of the wax strips.
8599000	8600000	I feel it.
8600000	8603000	Oh, I'm not sure about that one, Chief.
8603000	8609000	I mean, if you want to, I guess it's natural but I'm not sure about it.
8610000	8614000	The clam will be strong and tight enough to snap tentacles.
8615000	8617000	Oh, just inked his pants somewhere.
8617000	8618000	Praise be to Talos.
8620000	8623000	You'd be surprised how many, like the pheromone pet.
8623000	8624000	Let me go snap.
8625000	8631000	Right, I'm going to edit this so that's you and that's you and that's you.
8631000	8633000	Okay, deal.
8633000	8637000	So this one's you and this one's you and this one's you.
8637000	8639000	And then my accord with you.
8640000	8641000	Cute face.
8641000	8642000	Yeah, you're like my...
8643000	8647000	I can't get around the bend because I still don't know how to drift in that game.
8647000	8651000	I'm probably going to have to look up a tutorial unironically on how to do that game.
8651000	8652000	Can you also run me over?
8652000	8654000	Why would I run you over?
8654000	8658000	I'll run a train on you but I will not run over with you in an automobile.
8658000	8660000	All those racers, me.
8660000	8661000	Literally me.
8661000	8662000	That'll be me.
8666000	8668000	Blue shell coming at you.
8668000	8669000	No!
8669000	8671000	You want me to edit a blue shell?
8671000	8672000	Reflink coming at me?
8672000	8673000	That would actually be really funny.
8673000	8674000	Hold on.
8674000	8676000	Hold on, you're giving me oil up.
8676000	8677000	Who said oil up?
8677000	8679000	I've just caught that.
8679000	8681000	I want her to outward me.
8681000	8687000	No, don't use the interactive chat in a puzzle game to state your claims.
8687000	8691000	Okay, last thumbnail if I'm not mistaken.
8691000	8693000	It's not the most exciting.
8693000	8696000	I don't know what this game contains but you guys were like,
8696000	8700000	Oh, it's a sad game.
8700000	8705000	Okay, so you'll never guess what I did with the thumbnail.
8705000	8711000	At last but not least, please can I buy the wax strip?
8711000	8715000	Funny you mentioned that because I could have sworn I saw a tech talk about a girl that
8715000	8718000	made a hundred dollars because she used to sell her wax strips.
8718000	8720000	I don't think you're joking.
8720000	8724000	I don't think that Reflink's joking.
8724000	8726000	I'm getting nervous, okay?
8726000	8728000	I'm getting shaky.
8728000	8730000	The intimidation music shift.
8730000	8733000	Oh no, sorry, I'm not showing the screen.
8733000	8736000	Whoopsies.
8736000	8739000	Next thing you know, people are asking about Johnny's bathwater.
8739000	8743000	I wish I could do that but I feel like I'm like so nasty.
8743000	8745000	I want her to outward me.
8745000	8747000	No, don't use the alternative chat as well.
8747000	8749000	You both can't be started on both sides.
8749000	8751000	That's terrible, Reflink.
8751000	8754000	So I have to enter a puzzle chat to save by all things.
8754000	8757000	No!
8757000	8761000	This is terrible.
8761000	8763000	Alright, we're going to meet them while you're at it.
8763000	8765000	Alright, enough, enough, enough, we're getting too far.
8765000	8767000	I'm going to get this going to be limited ads.
8767000	8770000	I'm going to end up being demonetised.
8770000	8772000	Johnny being nasty and more like tasty.
8772000	8773000	I love this woman.
8773000	8775000	Love you, Terry Reflink.
8775000	8776000	Hi!
8776000	8777000	Join the queue for...
8777000	8778000	Okay, you're done.
8778000	8779000	Cutie.
8779000	8781000	Now you're in cutie.
8781000	8782000	What I need to do for mom...
8782000	8784000	No!
8784000	8787000	No, no more.
8787000	8790000	Filling the database with all these comments.
8790000	8793000	Honestly, they're going to be like one error that's going on.
8793000	8795000	Gennlain.
8795000	8798000	Johnny could probably make bank sale and use...
8798000	8802000	Used what?
8802000	8804000	Absolutely not.
8804000	8805000	Use pads.
8805000	8807000	Are you serious?
8807000	8810000	Are you guys vampires or something?
8810000	8812000	Absolutely not.
8812000	8814000	Reflink's kind of freaky.
8814000	8815000	Chat restraints.
8815000	8818000	Reflects the streamer through and through.
8818000	8822000	That's terrible.
8822000	8824000	Fine, no R wording.
8824000	8826000	Just go to town, though.
8826000	8829000	I'm going to hug this woman until she falls asleep and go flying.
8829000	8831000	Funny you mentioned vampires.
8831000	8833000	Is that going to be a teabag?
8833000	8835000	Is that going to be a teabag?
8835000	8837000	What?
8837000	8839000	Funny you mentioned vampire.
8839000	8842000	Is that going to be a teabag?
8842000	8845000	The pad is going to be a teabag for a vampire?
8845000	8847000	Ewww!
8847000	8848000	Stop!
8848000	8850000	Right, you've won the gross comment of the day, Reflink.
8850000	8851000	Congrats.
8851000	8852000	Don't...
8852000	8854000	Queeflings?
8854000	8857000	No.
8857000	8858000	No.
8858000	8859000	Absolutely not.
8859000	8863000	You guys are not referring to yourselves as fucking queeflings.
8863000	8866000	Do I make myself abundantly clear?
8866000	8869000	Listen to the tone of my voice.
8869000	8875000	You are not referring to yourselves as queeflings.
8875000	8878000	Absolutely not.
8878000	8880000	Absolutely not.
8880000	8882000	Why not?
8882000	8886000	Why not?
8886000	8889000	It is so cursed.
8889000	8890000	Don't worry, mummy.
8890000	8892000	We will always be your queeflings.
8892000	8893000	We love you.
8893000	8894000	I'm a queefling now.
8894000	8897000	Azura, don't encourage them!
8897000	8899000	Azura, no!
8899000	8905000	Azura, you're going to encourage them!
8905000	8908000	How many subs for a queefling meme ASMR?
8908000	8911000	I don't know how to queef.
8911000	8913000	I don't know how to do it.
8913000	8917000	Mods, panasura, mods, timasura.
8917000	8919000	Kidding.
8919000	8922000	Mummy being staring gets us going.
8922000	8925000	Call ourselves worst things?
8925000	8926000	No.
8926000	8927000	Queeflings...
8927000	8928000	No!
8928000	8929000	Right, I'm not reading that word.
8929000	8930000	If I see that word, I'm not reading it.
8930000	8931000	Do you understand?
8931000	8932000	Start practicing.
8932000	8933000	I don't have a word.
8933000	8934000	Yeah.
8934000	8935000	Name of...
8935000	8936000	Oh, that game.
8936000	8937000	Yeah, it's a tearjerker.
8937000	8938000	Absolutely not.
8938000	8939000	Oh, I'm jerking all right.
8939000	8940000	Sort of way.
8940000	8941000	I don't know what's in it.
8941000	8943000	You guys just told me it was really sad.
8943000	8945000	So I was like, okay.
8945000	8946000	Mods, panasura, Azura.
8946000	8947000	She has the wrench.
8947000	8948000	Only you and your admins can.
8948000	8949000	Oh.
8949000	8950000	She's immune.
8950000	8952000	Oh, you guys are fucking...
8952000	8953000	Oh, that...
8953000	8954000	Azura created the mods.
8954000	8955000	You can't ban her.
8955000	8956000	I'll literally...
8956000	8957000	Azura is your mummy.
8957000	8959000	How are you going to stop us?
8959000	8961000	Going to pin us down and force it out of us?
8961000	8962000	Okay, we're back to our word.
8962000	8963000	And that's more like it.
8963000	8964000	That's more like it.
8964000	8969000	If Strani became a muscle mummy, would we switch to beeflings?
8969000	8970000	That's actually kind of humorous.
8970000	8972000	I'll give you that one.
8973000	8976000	Strani after running a train on the reeflings.
8976000	8977000	She's a queer...
8977000	8978000	We're queeflings now.
8981000	8982000	Shut the fuck up.
8982000	8983000	Sorry.
8984000	8985000	Beeflings?
8985000	8986000	Wait, what else is going to mean?
8986000	8987000	Meaf...
8987000	8988000	Meaflings?
8990000	8991000	Beeflings?
8993000	8997000	When the reeflings are thrown pests on each other,
8997000	8999000	they become beeflings.
9000000	9002000	Because it's beeflinging.
9003000	9005000	Oh my god, what other words?
9005000	9006000	Eaflings?
9010000	9011000	Weeflings?
9011000	9015000	See, I'm looking at my keyboard to go through the alphabet.
9015000	9016000	Eaflings?
9016000	9017000	C-flings?
9018000	9019000	C-flings?
9020000	9021000	C-fling you across...
9021000	9023000	I see you and I fling you across the room.
9024000	9025000	D-flings?
9026000	9027000	Beeflings?
9027000	9028000	G-flings?
9029000	9030000	G-flings?
9031000	9032000	He-flings?
9033000	9034000	G-flings?
9035000	9036000	G-flings?
9037000	9038000	Sneeflings?
9038000	9039000	When the reeflings are sick,
9039000	9040000	I talk them in the bed
9040000	9042000	because they're my little sneeflings.
9045000	9047000	Oh, that's so cute.
9047000	9048000	With mummy numbs my ears,
9048000	9050000	I become a tingling.
9050000	9054000	Wait, isn't a tingling the things in Legend of Zelda?
9054000	9056000	Aren't they called tinglings?
9058000	9059000	If we get too cheesy,
9059000	9061000	are we called brieflings?
9061000	9063000	Oh my god, that's so good.
9064000	9066000	Fun reeflings go wee flings.
9067000	9069000	Sorry, that one was bad.
9069000	9071000	They hold short, they hold swords.
9071000	9073000	We call them sheathlings.
9074000	9075000	When reeflings are upset,
9075000	9077000	they're grieflings.
9077000	9078000	I'm loving this, sorry.
9078000	9080000	When the reeflings are gassy,
9080000	9081000	we become que-
9081000	9082000	No!
9082000	9083000	No!
9083000	9084000	No, not that one.
9084000	9085000	Everyone else, everything good.
9085000	9086000	Not that one.
9086000	9087000	GG.
9088000	9089000	Your tight climb syndrome
9089000	9090000	made me queefing.
9090000	9091000	Yeah, I've never,
9091000	9092000	I don't know how to do it.
9092000	9094000	So, I'll look up a tutorial.
9096000	9097000	I'll look up a tutorial
9097000	9098000	and I'll do it.
9099000	9100000	Oh my god.
9102000	9103000	Oh my god.
9103000	9105000	That was so good to end on.
9105000	9106000	Holy crap.
9106000	9108000	That's all my thumbnails for the week.
9108000	9110000	I hope you enjoyed that.
9110000	9111000	That was hilarious.
9112000	9113000	Oh.
9115000	9116000	That was so good.
9118000	9119000	Alright.
9119000	9120000	When mommy post audios,
9120000	9122000	we become stifflings.
9122000	9125000	Oh no, I have to edit the audios too.
9128000	9130000	I need to edit one of my audios
9130000	9132000	and one of Azuras today.
9133000	9134000	I forgot about that.
9134000	9135000	Right.
9135000	9136000	First, nap.
9137000	9138000	Second,
9138000	9139000	Umi plus.
9140000	9141000	Third,
9142000	9143000	maybe nap again
9143000	9145000	depending on how tired I am.
9145000	9147000	No, I got signed out on my YouTube.
9147000	9148000	Are you serious?
9149000	9150000	Oh, for god's sake.
9150000	9151000	Hold on.
9152000	9153000	I don't know why.
9153000	9155000	I seem to get signed out on my YouTube so much.
9158000	9159000	Hold on.
9160000	9161000	Hold on.
9161000	9162000	I need to look into the old.
9166000	9168000	I need to look into it.
9169000	9170000	No way.
9170000	9172000	Why does it keep signing me out?
9172000	9174000	I'm not doing anything against the law here.
9177000	9178000	Oh my god.
9178000	9179000	I don't think I can redirect.
9179000	9182000	I think I'm going to have to go on my other PC
9182000	9183000	because I have two PCs.
9183000	9184000	That's right, baby.
9186000	9188000	And redirect via the other PC
9188000	9190000	then come back here and wrap up stream.
9190000	9191000	Does that make sense?
9191000	9193000	Or should I wrap up now and disappear?
9193000	9194000	No.
9194000	9196000	Because I need to be on in order to do the redirect.
9197000	9198000	Man, this is fun.
9198000	9201000	I don't know why I get signed out on YouTube so much.
9201000	9202000	I don't know.
9202000	9203000	It's bizarre.
9203000	9205000	We are reeflings in strontiae.
9205000	9206000	Our words are...
9206000	9207000	No, no, no.
9207000	9209000	That's not why I called you reeflings.
9210000	9213000	I called you them because of the halflings
9213000	9214000	from Lord of the Rings.
9215000	9216000	You're not called reeflings
9216000	9218000	because I are a word you on a daily basis.
9219000	9221000	When in doubt, just assume YouTube hates me.
9221000	9222000	Yeah, honestly.
9223000	9224000	Oh my god.
9225000	9227000	I don't even think I have my outro asset.
9227000	9228000	I'm not even kidding.
9228000	9230000	I do have an ending screen.
9231000	9233000	Do I dare to use it?
9235000	9237000	I actually have an ending screen.
9238000	9239000	I think we're going to use it
9239000	9240000	for the first time ever.
9241000	9243000	Wait, so we're all our word halflings?
9243000	9245000	No, that's not why I called you.
9246000	9249000	Well, okay, ending screen it is then.
9249000	9250000	I've literally not used it.
9251000	9253000	I think I used it once for debut and never again.
9255000	9257000	A once in a lifetime event, I dare you.
9257000	9258000	Okay.
9259000	9260000	Thank you so so much
9260000	9262000	for having such a carry on with me.
9262000	9265000	I hope you enjoyed the artwork reveals
9265000	9268000	and the fun things that I did have behind the scenes
9268000	9272000	as well as my thumbnails and my schedule.
9272000	9273000	I thought that was really fun.
9273000	9274000	Please don't be.
9274000	9276000	I might do that again in the future
9276000	9278000	because it was like no download, no hassle,
9278000	9279000	no fuss, no nothing.
9280000	9283000	Thank you for puzzling with the puzzles all over you.
9284000	9286000	My puzzle league flings, I tried.
9286000	9287000	I'm sorry.
9288000	9289000	I love Winston.
9289000	9290000	I love you.
9290000	9291000	Love you.
9291000	9293000	Thank you for enjoying stream.
9293000	9295000	I might do that again.
9295000	9296000	If I get more behind the scenes stuff
9296000	9298000	that I can kind of leak via a puzzle
9298000	9300000	because I find that absolutely hilarious.
9300000	9301000	I don't know why.
9301000	9303000	It's tickling my pickle in a very good way.
9303000	9304000	Okay.
9304000	9305000	That was so fun.
9305000	9306000	Thank you for hanging out.
9306000	9309000	Next week's stream snipe game is Mario Kart.
9310000	9313000	I am going to be going live again today.
9314000	9316000	To watch the Yumi Plus concert.
9316000	9319000	I'm just going to make sure.
9321000	9324000	I'm just going to make sure what time it's at.
9324000	9325000	Okay.
9325000	9326000	It's at 10 a.m.
9326000	9328000	So if I go to bed right now,
9328000	9330000	I can get a cheeky two hour sleep.
9332000	9335000	Can I tickle your pickle and push the naughty over?
9336000	9337000	No.
9337000	9338000	Two weeks.
9338000	9339000	Give me two weeks.
9339000	9341000	And then all the thought already begins again.
9341000	9344000	You give me two weeks and I'll start cooking all over again.
9344000	9346000	But yes, that was so fun.
9346000	9347000	Thank you for hanging.
9347000	9348000	Thank you for lurking.
9348000	9349000	Thank you for doing puzzles.
9349000	9352000	Again, Azura came in and did puzzles at one point as well.
9352000	9356000	I'm going to use my ending screen.
9356000	9357000	I cannot believe it.
9357000	9359000	And then I'm going to run and boot up my PC
9359000	9361000	and then actually redirect into someone.
9361000	9363000	Is she be live right now?
9364000	9366000	She better be.
9367000	9368000	She be cotton bum.
9368000	9370000	You better be live right now.
9370000	9372000	I'm going to spank you.
9376000	9378000	Is there no VR lure girl live?
9384000	9385000	Oh no.
9385000	9387000	This can't be.
9387000	9388000	Oh.
9388000	9390000	Well, if there's no VR lure girl live,
9390000	9391000	I'll just...
9391000	9392000	I'll go live.
9392000	9393000	Are you going live?
9393000	9394000	What are you going to play?
9394000	9395000	Don't say legal legends.
9395000	9398000	I've redirected into legal legends too many times Azura.
9398000	9399000	You're getting spanked for it.
9400000	9401000	What are you going live with?
9401000	9402000	You want that too?
9405000	9406000	DEMPA's doing a...
9406000	9407000	I can't...
9408000	9409000	Don't do it.
9409000	9410000	She's going to play League again.
9410000	9413000	Azura, you were showing off your skins at one point
9413000	9417000	and you were telling us about your favourite character.
9417000	9419000	I've forgotten their name.
9419000	9421000	But they kind of looked like you.
9421000	9422000	And I was like...
9422000	9423000	Oh.
9423000	9425000	Because they had like big blue hair.
9425000	9426000	DEMPA's live right now?
9426000	9427000	One, two inches.
9427000	9428000	One, two inches.
9428000	9429000	DEM...
9429000	9430000	I went to bed this morning.
9430000	9431000	Azura's still going.
9431000	9433000	She is addicted.
9433000	9435000	Coming for my endurance title.
9435000	9437000	How dare you Azura.
9437000	9439000	Are you actually going live?
9439000	9440000	Or will I redirect into DEMPA?
9440000	9444000	If it's DEMPA's birthday, I'll go redirect into DEMPA.
9444000	9445000	Azura's legalings?
9445000	9446000	Honestly.
9446000	9447000	No, no, I was joking.
9447000	9448000	No live.
9448000	9449000	I was going to say,
9449000	9451000	you need rest before this little watch long.
9453000	9454000	I'm teasing, I'm teasing.
9454000	9456000	Right, I'm going to go redirect into DEMPA
9456000	9457000	because it's her doughnathon.
9457000	9459000	You'll need to give me like two minutes to run
9459000	9461000	and put up my computer and get it set up.
9461000	9463000	Is this fucking...
9463000	9465000	I have no idea.
9466000	9467000	I have...
9467000	9468000	Oh, wait, hold on.
9470000	9471000	Hold on, we have a...
9471000	9473000	Oh, pause, pause.
9473000	9475000	We might not need the ending screen at all.
9475000	9477000	I repeat, ladies and gentlemen,
9477000	9479000	we might not need that ending screen at all.
9480000	9482000	It will remain a mystery.
9482000	9483000	You have even...
9483000	9485000	You have yet to see...
9486000	9488000	You have yet to actually see
9488000	9490000	my stingers as well.
9490000	9492000	I was accessing my files yesterday
9492000	9495000	because I was having to send stuff to my editors,
9495000	9498000	Arisa, and I was looking at the files
9498000	9499000	and I saw my stinger and I'm like,
9499000	9501000	I have yet to show my actual stingers.
9501000	9503000	I have credit on the website
9503000	9505000	for the people who made my stingers,
9505000	9507000	but the actual stingers...
9509000	9511000	Are you trolling me?
9511000	9513000	Did you say DEMPA is live?
9513000	9514000	When she...
9514000	9516000	No one is live!
9516000	9517000	Upcoming, upcoming.
9517000	9519000	I don't see one live person
9519000	9520000	that I'm subscribed to.
9520000	9522000	I think they said DEMPA was live.
9522000	9523000	Is she live on Twitch?
9523000	9525000	Did you think I could redirect on Twitch?
9525000	9527000	Are you trolling me?
9528000	9529000	Oh, she is live.
9529000	9530000	What the fuck?
9530000	9532000	Why did that not show up?
9532000	9533000	That's so dumb.
9533000	9535000	Sorry, it never showed up for some reason.
9535000	9536000	You were telling the truth.
9536000	9537000	I'm so sorry.
9537000	9539000	Okay, do you actually want to see
9539000	9541000	the ending screen, to be honest?
9543000	9544000	Okay, I'll show you the end.
9544000	9545000	She is though.
9545000	9546000	Sorry, it wasn't displayed.
9546000	9547000	I don't know.
9547000	9549000	There are a lot of things displayed at once.
9549000	9551000	You think we're that dumb?
9551000	9552000	Well, I'm dumb
9552000	9554000	and sometimes chat's the reflection
9554000	9555000	of this dreamer,
9555000	9557000	so what does that make two of us, huh?
9560000	9562000	Okay, I'll show it.
9562000	9563000	Thank you so much for hanging out
9563000	9564000	with me, Reeflings.
9564000	9565000	Tomorrow, we will be drawing
9565000	9567000	your stinky gen 2 suggestions.
9567000	9569000	So please keep that in the back of your mind.
9569000	9572000	You're welcome to submit it via Marshmallow,
9572000	9574000	or you can do it live in the chat.
9574000	9575000	But if you do Marshmallow,
9575000	9577000	I can probably mentally prepare a bit better
9577000	9578000	for what I'm going to draw.
9578000	9581000	So don't be afraid to use Marshmallows.
9581000	9582000	Thank you so, so much.
9582000	9584000	I'll see you good for givers tomorrow
9584000	9586000	and I'll put up all my wait rooms and all that.
9586000	9589000	No, I'll see you in Yumi Plus Concert.
9589000	9590000	Give me two...
9591000	9592000	Three hours.
9592000	9594000	Three hours, I'll see you in Yumi Plus Concert.
9594000	9596000	Okay, I'll be singing and stuff, okay?
9596000	9597000	And then we're going to take notes
9597000	9599000	and then I'm going to ask Yumi Plus and be like,
9599000	9600000	hey, how the fuck did you do that concert?
9600000	9602000	Because I want to do it for my girls.
9603000	9605000	Okay, thank you so, so much.
9605000	9607000	I'll see you later today, Reefling.
9607000	9608000	But please enjoy Dampock
9608000	9610000	because it's her little birthday.
9610000	9612000	Even just lurking in the shadows is helpful, okay?
9612000	9613000	Bye-bye!
9613000	9615000	Time to use my end screens.
9615000	9616000	Oh, who goes there?
9616000	9617000	I need to...
9627000	9629000	Alright, can you hear me?
9629000	9630000	Okay, you can.
9630000	9633000	This is my actual streamer's ending scene.
9634000	9635000	Ta-da!
9635000	9636000	I did it.
9636000	9638000	I had to censor it because...
9638000	9640000	Yeah, it's very...
9640000	9642000	It's very OP.
9642000	9643000	Now, let's meet and look at you on my head
9643000	9644000	with your nicotine patch
9644000	9646000	and we both have hypnosis toggles
9646000	9650000	because you can technically hypnotise me too, Reefling.
9650000	9652000	Did you not know that about your lore?
9652000	9655000	That you're naughty and you hypnotise me sometime?
9656000	9657000	Hmm?
9659000	9660000	Yeah.
9661000	9664000	Yes, I have Butt Fangs and I have Booba
9664000	9666000	and I had to cover it.
9667000	9669000	Don't forget to like and subscribe
9669000	9670000	for the other industry.
9670000	9671000	She's actually...
9671000	9672000	It's true, it's real.
9672000	9674000	Okay, I'll test out the stingers
9674000	9676000	at another date, okay?
9676000	9678000	Need to give us a hypno-ending streamer.
9678000	9679000	Yeah, you like it?
9681000	9683000	Well, we're listening to...
9684000	9687000	Lea Jean de Zelda, but yeah.
9688000	9689000	We usually don't have to
9689000	9691000	since you prefer the backfire scenario.
9691000	9693000	Honestly, I love it.
9693000	9694000	Shove a mirror in my face.
9694000	9696000	I'm going to be right back
9696000	9698000	writing a new marrow right now.
9699000	9700000	Okay.
9700000	9701000	I don't want to go yet.
9701000	9703000	I'm really enjoying today's stream.
9703000	9704000	That was really fun.
9704000	9705000	I enjoyed that.
9705000	9706000	I don't know.
9706000	9708000	I like when we do stuff together.
9708000	9710000	Does that make me a weirdo?
9710000	9711000	No.
9711000	9714000	It makes me in love with you.
9716000	9717000	Thank you.
9717000	9718000	That was a really pleasant...
9718000	9720000	I know you can't see my model right now,
9720000	9722000	so I'm just trying.
9722000	9724000	That was an incredibly fun stream.
9724000	9725000	I thoroughly enjoyed that.
9725000	9728000	I really like when we can hang out like that.
9729000	9731000	And I look forward to doing it more.
9732000	9734000	Yes, I'll get going.
9734000	9736000	I'm going to go for a little chicken nap.
9736000	9738000	Maybe squeeze out a little chicken,
9738000	9739000	a little for bread while I'm at it.
9739000	9741000	And then we can watch Yumi Plus together
9741000	9742000	and take notes.
9742000	9743000	Love you too, dismembered voice.
9743000	9745000	Literally, you can't even see my wee model.
9745000	9748000	Spends like a ridiculous amount of money on model.
9748000	9750000	Doesn't even use it and just chats on the end and screen.
9750000	9752000	But yeah, it's a really good loop.
9752000	9756000	The loading screens were made by YumiYumiWorks.
9756000	9757000	They were fantastic.
9757000	9760000	They were such a good sport about everything.
9760000	9764000	I was like, it is paramount that reeflings are with me.
9764000	9766000	Because at first I was going to be the only one
9766000	9768000	that had their mascot in their loading screen.
9768000	9773000	You're not giving me money because I used my...
9773000	9775000	I will send you...
9775000	9777000	I will do the stingers tomorrow, okay?
9777000	9778000	I will do them tomorrow.
9778000	9781000	I need to send them to this PC because they're on my other PC.
9783000	9786000	I will show you what my stingers look like tomorrow.
9786000	9788000	Don't give me money for that though.
9788000	9793000	Thank you, Murizyo for the five.
9793000	9797000	Don't give me money for doing stuff that an average streamer does.
9798000	9802000	What's that letter in the middle?
9802000	9803000	An O?
9803000	9804000	Strong E?
9804000	9807000	Stip, writ, awe, knit, net, eh?
9807000	9809000	Unless I'm not understanding.
9810000	9813000	It feels like I can still hear her voice.
9813000	9814000	Pepe hands.
9814000	9816000	No, that was really fun.
9816000	9817000	We'll try Mario Kart.
9817000	9818000	See what's going on.
9818000	9820000	We'll know the world is truly ending when a stream starts
9820000	9822000	and she's using the starting.
9822000	9824000	That's when you know, literally,
9824000	9827000	censor hate is always hypnotizing us.
9827000	9829000	Stranny.
9829000	9831000	I wonder what's behind the veal or what.
9831000	9832000	My butt fangs.
9832000	9834000	You're not really supposed to be showing butt fangs,
9834000	9835000	but I have butt fangs.
9835000	9837000	So does Mercy actually.
9838000	9840000	She's broken as I hear her in my head.
9840000	9841000	Stranny.
9841000	9842000	Stranny.
9842000	9843000	Stranny.
9843000	9844000	Stranny.
9844000	9845000	Stranny.
9845000	9847000	Stranny Gonzalez.
9847000	9849000	Forget speedy Gonzalez.
9849000	9850000	Stranny Gonzalez.
9850000	9853000	One minute fifty-six beat my record right now.
9854000	9855000	Hello.
9855000	9856000	Hello.
9856000	9857000	I'm about to go.
9857000	9858000	Stream's ending.
9858000	9860000	I'm just trying to shake.
9861000	9863000	Bansley give butt fangs, yes.
9865000	9868000	I'm gonna see, maybe Nari might work on a nude model for me.
9868000	9869000	I'm not sure.
9870000	9872000	I haven't been drawn nude.
9872000	9874000	But maybe Nari'll entertain me.
9874000	9876000	Entertain me.
9877000	9879000	Stay with me.
9880000	9882000	La la la la la la la la…
9882000	9883000	feeling.
9883000	9885000	And those are not the words at all,
9885000	9887000	I have no idea what the words are.
9887000	9889000	Um, actually funny you mention stay with me
9889000	9891000	that song by the way?
9891000	9894000	That, I'm making a short about that song.
9895000	9897000	The, I don't know how you did that,
9897000	9898000	but anyway.
9898000	9900000	The thought of that making me unwhysed.
9901000	9902000	Yes.
9902000	9905000	And we're probably at the karaoke where Dad goes away too.
9905000	9909020	I think I'll do ASMR, bathtub is my first stream.
9909020	9911760	And then I'll do membership karaoke
9911760	9914360	just to really give my voice the wham bam
9914360	9916040	so I have no voice at all.
9916040	9917000	You have butt fangs?
9917000	9917840	What coincidence?
9917840	9920120	I also have fangs and they should meet your butt.
9921320	9923200	Congrats again on 10k, thank you.
9923200	9926240	That video propelled us ahead.
9926240	9929480	That person, that clip, did that highlight reel?
9929480	9930720	Like fucking threw us ahead.
9930720	9931880	I'm not listening, right?
9931880	9934720	I'm going offline, I'm going offline.
9934720	9939640	Thank you for the very kind and super chat
9939640	9942120	if it's on YouTube or still a tip, okay?
9942120	9943800	Thank you for your tip.
9943800	9947920	Maurizio, I'm absolutely butchering your name, Maurizio.
9947920	9950120	Okay, I'm going to go for a nap.
9950120	9951540	I will see you in three hours, okay?
9951540	9953080	Too many is three hours, okay?
9953080	9953920	Enjoy your nap.
9953920	9956360	If you want to nap with me, you can nap with me.
9956360	9957680	I'm not going to say no.
9959840	9962800	Bye-bye, strongy, bye, reef flings.
9962800	9964960	I read that, but I'm not saying that.
9964960	9966640	He's distracted by something.
9966640	9968120	Mods, get that man.
9968120	9971080	Okay, good night, I, no, no, good night.
9971080	9973280	Later, three hours, for goodness sake, woman.
9973280	9975080	Three hours, enjoy denpa.
