that woman instead of either naming her and addressing her by saying i did not have a like her

getting ignored i'm playing black ops with the refluence we're all jerking each other sorry

76
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,480
um did my chat break no did mine

77
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,680
we're being held at gunpoint a wee bit only cousin love this did you get rest at least

78
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:58,480
so i have my soup ingredients i have i got red is it red split pea lentils

79
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,040
or they look like carrot a little bits of carrot but they're not um so i got that i got i don't know

80
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,520
why i forgot about onion the staple of a freaking soup and then i went to go buy chicken bouillon

81
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,280
and couldn't find it and then i ended up buying the wrong thing and and i know what the right one

82
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,800
looks like now and i'm so mad at myself because i second guessed it because in australia we're closer

83
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:33,360
to um like uh china there was a chinese bouillon like chicken bouillon but it was in chinese but

84
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,680
it looked like the right thing and i was like maybe maybe but then i decided not to go with it

85
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:47,040
and i went home and i looked at uh i watched like um cooking videos and someone pulled out the very

86
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:55,520
freaking chicken bouillon and i'm like no a second guess so the long story short don't second guess

87
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:05,840
yourself or you're gonna mess it up have you tried stockpots i would i think bouillon is actually

88
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:12,080
better than stockpots i got like a different thing i'm so sorry if no one cares about a soup let me

89
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:20,560
just talk about my soup okay i'm passionate about it i got mushrooms i got carrot onion potatoes

90
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,560
garlic uh and then the base is going to be the chicken because i got willy's chicken but

91
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:35,040
the magpies never came out to see me i normally feed the magpie some chicken when i get it but

92
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:44,400
gimley and vego had some chicken uh um so i need to pick the chicken off of the actual bones and

93
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:51,440
then i need to boil the bones in the uh like two liters of water for like two hours and that'll

94
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,280
make the base and it may not need too much flavor after that because like the flavoring comes from

95
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,040
like out of the like it oozes out the bones and stuff i don't know if it's called collagen

96
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:09,440
but um i just need to cut up all the vegetables and i was going to roast them in the oven boy

97
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:16,320
your mama like that kind of roast um and put like all the season and stuff then whack it in

98
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:25,840
then whack some chicken back into the liquid and then if it goes nicely i'm gonna freeze it all

99
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,560
and then it means i have healthy soup for the next few days and if that goes super well put

100
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:41,280
um then i can it's my no my makes it looks like my makes the lid a little bit like it's not instant

101
00:13:41,280 --> 00:14:00,560
um that sounds more like a stew to me um probably um i want more me soup

102

121
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,240
mental health issues that come with it but about two months ago i took heart and started

122
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,680
to get my life together the reason i'm writing this is because your overwhelming positivity

123
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,440
sparked this flame of change in me the way you take these issues serious and how you foster

124
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,000
a healthy relationship to adult content in your community has really helped me understand a few

125
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,920
things about myself also i'd rather just do the deed along your page for subscription than see

126
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:43,600

00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,520
feeling of giving it all you're all for other people and putting the effort in and the positive

130
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:05,040

134
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:34,320

185
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,200
you don't want to wait every 15 seconds for five seconds to load over and over again

186
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:09,840
so we're playing with that m16 it's a three burst fire weapon all the weapons i know in

197
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:12,880
i remember playing black ops one then when you a baby you never know maybe i wrecked you in public

i don't know if that technically makes you an elite gamer for putting up with that oh no the intel's

207
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,480
in this room

208
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:22,880
but yeah this game is very highly rated it's very good um they did remaster it if i'm not

209
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,960
mistaken where is the intel i swear it's in this room i'm losing it

210
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,800
i swear the intel the intel is on a crate on this level and it's like in a room that goes like this

211
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,840
i'm going for you i swear i swear it's in here

212
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,480

213
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,600
right fine i'll pretend that i don't know where the intels are it's on the barrel

214
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,200
it's yellow and tiny

215
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,000
i'm gone is this a fresh save i don't know maybe it's not maybe it remembers the last thing i've

216
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:14,320
played it a very long time ago now um maybe it remembers and i have picked it up

217
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,600
well velar cod zombies would go hard

218
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:26,560
was she be she be um is getting an interest in sure games and i'm like

219
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:35,760
and azura said she also played um what was it was it called or something something that surprised

220
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,440
me i wouldn't pick her out for the game because uh obviously when i first met her all i knew it was

221
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,240
legal age and so i'm getting absolutely twat in this whole week um right what's melee um

222
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:54,400
hold on hold on let me put melee on my uh me me me me mostly for

223
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:06,320
er um aim both enemies jeez yeah you're going to build them i can hardly see like the color

224
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:16,560
difference is really hard to see past. Oh, I'm on fire. What was that? B-26? We only

225
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:22,600
stand B-52s out here. No one's dropping a Famous. I'm starting to think this is personal,

226
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:32,160
buddy. Sorry, I'm trying to get kills through the furniture. There's another one in here.

227
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:48,520
Merda putana. I've been looking and loving and thinking and drinking. Is there only two?

228
00:28:48,520 --> 00:29:01,320
Is there anyone else? Gears this. Why no, Gears this. This is the RPK with an ACOG.

229
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:11,080
Now, did I like ACOG personally? I'm not much of an ACOG-er. Oh, no, not the pistol.

230
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:21,240
Okay, so we kill him, right? And then she... I forgot about the holy music that randomly plays.

231
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:29,720
And then she goes for you as well. She's got quite a little darts, eh? So I've got an ACOG.

232
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:35,800
She still protects him. She still protects him.

233
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,600
All right, back to the campaign. Me who's taking the campaign is so super serious right now.

234
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,920
I'm so serious. An MLG bro. Jeez, the recoil on this was harsh. I don't put burn on B.

235
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:05,000
I just want a Famous. Is that too much to ask? Famous Jewel Wheel. You walked past the enemy!

236
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:13,960
Oh, that's Bowman. Sorry, sorry, Bowman. Look, can you wear a different color from the enemy?

237
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:25,080
I'm needing support. Why are we all the same color as the enemies? Can't we not wear something

238
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:31,320
that clearly... Bro, I can't even see. Am I going crazy? Am I not hitting the targets?

239
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,800
No, I'm going down the stairs. No, leave me alone.

240
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:44,040
This is too many enemies for a level. This is the intro. Come at work, grand Geneva suggestion.

241
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:53,800
I think the Famous wasn't invented in this year. Wait, this is historically accurate too. No,

242
00:30:53,800 --> 00:31:02,840
I know they did a lot of Gucci stuff. Who just fired an RPG at me? Own up to...

243
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:11,640
Own up to who just literally fired an RPG at me. That's a bit dramatic, even by my standards.

244
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:21,560
Who did it? Own up to it. That's not... Ow! How are you spawning behind us? We've done a new checkpoint.

245
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:30,040
Right, who's therapy? Is it you? No. Who did it? Own up to it. I'm looking for you.

246
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:38,840
I can't see over the fire. I can see these guys shooting though. Hold on. Hold on.

247
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:48,360
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Yep. Mm-hmm. Take that. And this. And this. I think there's someone there.

248
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,640
The muzzle flashes are literally given all other positions away.

249
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,760
Calphish down. I don't know who's throwing the RPGs though.

250
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:06,120
I'm getting like... I actually have a freaking cover fire. Which one of you was it? Seriously,

251
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:13,880
that RPG thing was insane. Wait, did they keep respawning in the same place? I just said support.

252
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,640
It's okay, you're doing a great job. I'll support you.

253
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,640
There's too many of them.

254
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,360
But what am I... Oh, are we moving up? I thought...

255
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,760
Carlos, what's happening?

256
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,120
Carlos, what's happening?

257
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,120
Carlos!

258
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,120
Carlos!

259
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
Oh, Granada!

260
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,120
Luges!

261
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
Okay.

262
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
Ow!

263
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
They're high.

264
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,120
What do you mean I can't just sponge billets through the entire campaign mode?

265
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
Ooh!

266
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,120
Look at those.

267
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,120
Those are B-52s.

268
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120
Those are carpet bombers.

269
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,120
They go do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

270
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,120
And wipe out massive areas.

271
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,120
They are!

272
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,120
What am I supposed to do?

273
00:32:51,120 --> 00:33:06,120
I'm like on Mino, which is this game, like, a lot harder than I remember.

274
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,440
I don't remember being like this at all.

275
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:16,120
Someone spawned behind me?

276
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,320
Maybe you're just Mino.

277
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,320
All right.

278
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,800
Just let me be patient, my games.

279
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:26,200
I'm having a good time, having a good time, having a good time, committing war, crimes

280
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:34,120
across the country, and I won't be, what's the word, when you get done for it in court,

281
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,120
and I won't be...

282
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,120
The rebels are getting the asses kicked.

283
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,120
I can't.

284
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,120
What's...

285
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,120
What's it called?

286
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
I won't be prosecuted.

287
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,080
No, I won't, because I serve my country.

288
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:54,880
For the billion-dollar contracts, because they're coming through the stocks, yeah.

289
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:03,960
A hundred degrees, that's against the law, but don't stop me now, because I have a flame

290
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,960
woofer.

291
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,880
Don't stop me, because I'm having a flame woofer time.

292
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,680
Tomahawk is the best weapon.

293
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,680
Really?

294
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,240
I never used Tomahawks in this game, the Baylor.

295
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,240
Thank you.

296
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,240
Mummy's up.

297
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,240
Ah!

298
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:26,480
No, it's only funny when I do the weapon destruction and stuff.

299
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:33,200
Can't wait any longer, will.

300
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,080
So we're just going to spray and pray down everything.

301
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,160
Like I kid you not everything.

302
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:46,480
It doesn't matter who or what it is, it's getting done.

303
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,480
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

304
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,720
Like, laddo, go to hell.

305
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:02,480
They're going to call me the new Bluetooth, the way I'll be connecting these bullets to

306
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
your forehead.

307
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:10,560
We didn't know Bluetooth was actually a Viking that connected large regions together that

308
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:17,880
were once thought like, oh, XD, impossible, because they hate each other, but then the

309
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,840
Viking named Bluetooth.

310
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,840
What's the problem?

311
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:33,320
Am I about to get, okay, they'll chew you up at them.

312
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:40,720
I'm spraying, but nothing's happening.

313
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,720
Okay, there we go.

314
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:51,320
Okay, time to get captured.

315
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,320
Can I not hit the, ah!

316
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:00,200
I'm just an innocent little mason, I didn't hurt anybody, I may have committed one or

317
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,200
two war crimes, but that wasn't my fault.

318
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,200
I had to do it.

319
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,200
I didn't kill you.

320
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,200
No, you killed a double.

321
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,200
His name wasn't Bluetooth, no.

322
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,600
Vikings are normally named after either their wisdom or physical attributes, so he most

323
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:20,200
likely had a rotten tooth, and that's why he was called Bluetooth.

324
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Well, the suffering beyond his darkest fears.

325
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,200
Mommy now gets to go to the ink dungeon.

326
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:33,200
I hate planes, but you win, baby.

327
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:50,200
I don't know how much Vikings are named like Argonians in Skyrim, the main break about

328
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,200
to commence.

329
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
I'm on my high way, sir.

330
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
To Incutor?

331
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
That's so good.

332
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:14,200
Crazy, there are like 117 attempts on Castro and all we wanted to do was be a dictator

333
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,200
and breathe.

334
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,200
The perfect cow.

335
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Wait, is that real?

336
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,200
Like an actual cow?

337
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:30,200
Or he meant like Breda as an insult towards...

338
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,200
Doesn't the pod scream if safe you have the intel or not?

339
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:39,200
It definitely was in that second place, so because it was registered that I picked it

340
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,200
up, it might remember the last time I played on this computer.

341
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
Oh my god.

342
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:53,200
I was watching as there was a birthday stream.

343
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,200
This is completely off topic and not related.

344
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,200
Right, hold on.

345
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:03,200
Let's do the cutscenes first and then I'll see the other thing.

346
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,200
Rest off.

347
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:22,200
There's a man on me, I don't know if he's a reflinger.

348
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,200
Is there a speedy...

349
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,200
Is it related to the fuckup?

350
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
Yeah.

351
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Oh no, we're getting in trouble.

352
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,200
I'm sorry.

353
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,200
Obliet.

354
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,200
No.

355
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:43,200
Leave him alone.

356
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,200
Monk.

357
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,200
Hi, rest off.

358
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,200
Hi.

359
00:38:48,200 --> 00:39:03,200
That's me.

360
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,200
Secure the keys.

361
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,200
Secure the keys.

362
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:12,200
Secure the keys.

363
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,200
Warcoota.

364
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,200
War is step two.

365
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,200
Ascent from darkness.

366
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
Three.

367
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,200
Right.

368
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,200
Fire.

369
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
I rang fire.

370
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
I missed that one, sorry.

371
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
I got attacked there.

372
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,200
Five.

373
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
Four.

374
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,200
Five.

375
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
Four.

376
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Four.

377
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
Five.

378
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
Four.

379
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,200
Five.

380
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
Four.

381
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,200
Five.

382
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,200
Four.

383
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,200
Six.

384
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,200
Five.

385
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
No.

386
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,200
Five.

387
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,200
Five.

388
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Oh, I'm sorry, we're supposed to...

389
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
Look at him.

390
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,200
Okay.

391
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,200
Okay.

392
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,200
Friend.

393
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,200
Pri distributation care.

394
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,200
caring care care care care care care care care care care care care care care care care care

395
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,200

398
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
Oh, we're in a cutscene?

399
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:17,120
No, we're not the horde and warcraft. We're the goodies. We're the alliance, for the alliance.

400
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Abandoned.

401
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Hydration check.

402
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,560
Send from Fart?

403
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Is it really bad I farted on Gimli?

404
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,520
Right. I've said this the other day,

405
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:47,600
but Gimli likes to bite my butt to wake me up when she wants attention and I'm like, no, I'm

406
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:52,160
sleep- wait, why can't I pick this up? I'm like, no, I'm sleeping Gimli, leave me be. I got really

407
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:58,880
annoyed at her and I just farted on her and she just took it. Like, she didn't do anything. She wasn't

408
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,880
like anything.

409
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,760
For Gimli, honestly. Right, so they're getting right in-dict, unfortunately, and then we are

410
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,760
going to move there. I'm going. I'm coming. I'm going. I'm going.

411
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,920
Okay.

412
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,160
Oh, those are prisoners. Silly me.

413
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,440
Is there any dominance through a fart? Honestly, though.

414
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
Um,

415
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,120
leave him be.

416
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:40,480
We would all take it from you. It would- I would like a bite of cake. Oh, she doesn't like to wake me up and I'm like,

417
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,440
um, I purposely, like, I let her in a vehicle outside

418
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:51,760
for 30 minutes before I go to sleep and I play with them, I feed them, I make sure they're all sorted

419
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,640
and she's just still trying to bite me and I'm like, Gimli, please.

420
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,680
I have such a little sleep as it is. Please be nice to me, darling.

421
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,120
I can't even keep up with you.

422
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,400
Um,

423
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:15,120
but she's a cootie buttootie. I love her to smithereens. I really do. I love- I got, like, so blessed having

424
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,120
me be going Gimli in my life.

425
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,120
Um.

426
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,200
Ah!

427
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,720
Right. Were we doing it? Were we doing it? Were we going in?

428
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,720
Uh, as I was saying about Azura's birthday stream,

429
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,440
I haven't- so she- she's gonna do origami, like, handcam origami, which is adorable.

430
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,600
Um,

431
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,400
and she goes, I have tons of computer paper

432
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:55,440
and my brain was like, wow, like, I got warped into a different dimension because I've not heard that term

433
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,280
since my grandparents called it computer paper, not just paper.

434
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:08,480
Like, isn't paper and computer paper the same thing? Or am I going mental? Mental, like, Oriental.

435
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,160
Am I not supposed to up here yet? Okay, yeah.

436
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,600
Now, the intel is supposed to be up here.

437
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,720
Okay, it's taken. Right. Okay, the game seems to remember when I picked it up before.

438
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,840
Uh, right, let's go, let's go.

439
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,440
Uh, sure. I'm gonna guess the distance.

440
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,080
Now, if you get these three in a row perfectly, you will get an achievement. Ah!

441
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,280
I missed it. I'm getting out of this time.

442
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,480
Hermit, thank you for becoming a member. Please enjoy the emotes.

443
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,000
Um, yes, as I said, AC, Emmy, and

444
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:55,520
Mercy's emote batch is coming up first. Then, Sheebie is going to get- oh, fuck that one, I don't know.

445
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,200
Um, Sheebie's is gonna get- oh, I'm getting sick. How can I miss this up so much?

446
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:08,960
Sheebie is getting updated completely to, um, make it reflective of her.

447
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,920
Right, sorry, I shouldn't look away until I can look away.

448
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,600
Thank you again, Hermit, for becoming a member.

449
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,080
Up a bit! I wasn't paying attention. Sheesh.

450
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,880
Um, I don't know how I'm doing so bad. Thank you.

451
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,920
Right, well, and then super tall for this one because it's far away.

452
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,960
Too tall, somehow, even though that looked correct.

453
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,400
Thank you! Jeez!

454
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,400
Sergei had more than enough time to open that weapon, Kashi.

455
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,120
Yeah, sure, yeah.

456
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,560
Thank you very much. I'll take this KS.

457
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,520
Don't need boltcars!

458
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,200
Right, where are you? You're about- wait, what?

459
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,320
Why did that say prisoner on his name?

460
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,800
Who has a farmers? You have an AK-47.

461
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,040
Did you know the AK-47 is the most produced assault rifle in the world?

462
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,560
I don't really know why.

463
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,840
I don't know, maybe it doesn't jam as much as other assault rifles or something.

464
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,280
I like- I'm 99% sure this is the most contracted assault rifle in the entire world.

465
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,800
Aye! Why am I getting RPGs so much?

466
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,080
My biggest thing here is cheap and reliable.

467
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:24,800
Ah!

468
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:34,400
But yes, and then myself, Schuber, and- is there- am I supposed to spray this?

469
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,280
What? No?

470
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,280
Yo, what am I getting wrecked by?

471
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,600
Bro, I'm on the Triton recruitment mode, please!

472
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,920
Oh, that was an- that was an accidental aim down sight.

473
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,960
That wasn't supposed to happen.

474
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,440
Now, normally the AI is actually pretty fair in this game,

475
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,400
and if you're not looking at it, there's any Giza.

476
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,600
Give me what's this?

477
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,720
A harpoon to take down a chopper?

478
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,000
Does that really mess up helicopters that badly?

479
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,560
I wouldn't really think to use a harpoon to take down a chopper,

480
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,040
but maybe it would mess it up so badly.

481
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,800
Curious.

482
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,320
But yes, Azura showed her what she's doing,

483
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,840
and her move out goal and everything.

484
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,600
I hope you guys found it enjoyable.

485
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:40,960
She worked very hard on it, and she's really excited to do it,

486
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,800
and I hope it goes well.

487
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,200
She's been keeping me updated about, like, the-

488
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,520
Would you stop it?

489
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,560
How are you spawning there?

490
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,160
You weren't even there a second ago!

491
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,600
They're spawning on me!

492
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,480
You're cheating!

493
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,160
I'm going to-

494
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:04,000
I'm going to release her birthday trailer,

495
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,000
and then I'm going to ask management to put, like, money on it ad-wise,

496
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,080
so, like, more people will come aware when it is.

497
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,880
But as I said, we're all doing, like, a collab on her channel right away,

498
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,480
and I think it would be really fun to be like,

499
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,720
oh my god, thank you for the t-

500
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,160
thank you for supporting Azura!

501
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,120
Like, all of us are, like, going nuts over your name,

502
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,360
because she has support Azura.

503
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,120
I just find that really cute and sweet,

504
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,880
like, all six of us, like, oh no!

505
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:32,400
You know?

506
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,400
Yes, and then she's going to have-

507
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,920
Ah, he got shot at!

508
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,240
No sticky!

509
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,480
It's over, Sergei!

510
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,120
No, I'm so sorry if you named Sergei what you did.

511
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,040
You-

512
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,880
Yeah, it was a worthy sacrifice.

513
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,120
He has made the motherland proud.

514
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,200
Yeah, you're not hiding behind these little panels that much, are you?

515
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,320
Step six.

516
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,040
I watched a bit of her stream, and then she cried.

517
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:13,520
Oh no!

518
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:15,840
What did I-

519
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,320
What is it about her-

520
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,640
her pudding?

521
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,400
Someone gifted an artwork with her little pumpkin spice,

522
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,600
and I felt really, it was very sweet.

523
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,680
We never got to tell them how much we loved them,

524
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,720
but I'm so sorry!

525
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,360
Like, how they messed up my boy.

526
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,840
Do I have to leave now?

527
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,400
I thought- No!

528
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,800
No, you're fine.

529
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,480
Oh my goodness, he has so much armor!

530
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,640
I shall announce that I should have pre-

531
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,720
love you, have fun, and have fun fellow-

532
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,480
Love you too, love you too!

533
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,720
Thank you for the super chat, Momolo.

534
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,000
Please don't worry about it!

535
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,120
Wait, why am I to protect him?

536
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:15,680
From what?

537
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:18,960
How are they-

538
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,480
I don't even think I've ever-

539
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,000
Oh, checkpoints being reached!

540
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,720
Bro, I can't tell the difference between the enemies.

541
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,880
I'm really bad for it.

542
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,600
I guess the ha, but I don't know.

543
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,760
I always feel like whenever I played Call of Duty,

544
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,760
I always questioned if I was colorblind.

545
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,160
I found the saturation on the colors really hard to, like, differentiate.

546
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,760
Like, I think it's just the way that they've done,

547
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,920
aim, like the game-style type thing, stylistic.

548
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,560
Obviously, it's not exactly supposed to be my little pony,

549
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,880
where it's all sunshine and daisies,

550
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,280
but I just feel like the saturation could be like,

551
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,800
can I have a bit of a couple more color?

552
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,240
Hmm.

553
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,120
Bro, I felt guilty for noticing,

554
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,280
but I know how to be silly, silly closest.

555
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,120
Oh, ow!

556
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,240
Ow!

557
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,160
Don't do that.

558
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,440
That's cheeky doodle.

559
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,520
You're gonna make me fart.

560
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,720
You're gonna make me so nervous.

561
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,920
Whoa!

562
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,400
For me?

563
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,000
When the game calls it the death machine,

564
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,960
rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!

565
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,560
Where's Mason?

566
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,120
Oh, sorry.

567
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,320
Where's Red Snow?

568
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,800
My sensitivity's a bit higher than I anticipated.

569
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,040
Oh, no, you were a prisoner, sorry.

570
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,440
Not him being so close to freedom and I fuck it up because I can't tell the difference.

571
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,100
Why, yes, I'd love to carry the death machine.

572
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,220
Say no more!

573
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,700
For Mother Russia!

574
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:10,740
this is so satisfying wasn't this not a reward streak I think this was a reward streak I

575
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:17,060
kill streak and multiplayer if I'm not mistaken but I could be mistaken I could be a dumb

576
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:25,580
dumb god who was driving that that thing was ready to go outside down just a small bump

00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:16,660
and it and it has auto aim but which I love they hate us literally we're just

592
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,700
two prisoners oh I guess we're prisoners of war though so it makes us a bit more

593
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:26,900
valuable than like your average target basically which is understandable good to

594
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:38,460
know that I have some value me really living up to the stereotype about women

want to shoot the sign I mean I know the scientists are the baddies but

792
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:03,180
sometimes you know people the soldiers here are just here for a paycheck you

793
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:08,060
know they've got mortgages and stuff and kids and how home in that and I'm just

794
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:14,220
a bullet early in them although actually does the army recommend you not to have

795
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:22,300
a partner am I going mental no I wouldn't say that's a mental thought sorry I'm

799
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:44,780
been aiming properly this whole time and I could have just been spamming him from

800
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:50,780
my hip what was in here you just chilling in there that's right aim down

801

803
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:11,540
how good the things that even this late in the fire he's decided to throw

804
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:16,740
himself out he literally could have hid and we and walked away but he was like

805
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:22,620
nah I get paid enough to deal with us it's common for military men to have

806
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:32,620
relationships weren't down cuz of Jody and his wife back home what's Jody

807
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:35,900
mommy's hips is strong

808
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:39,260
I curious he goes out the window hip fire and choirs

809
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:49,360
rise aim optional literally the aim is optional in hip fire and I say for

810
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:58,480
place sabotage the show we it's space program any show me it's dim hip shots

811
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:06,100
don't miss I remember running a niki aki and

812
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:14,380
firing was so fun I found a family to be the most desirable gun spoke to me on

813
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:18,340
another level so what you are saying is we should don't know to you as to a

814
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:26,100
seara just like the others so Azura hasn't as I spoke about this before on

815
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:30,100
stream so I think I'm okay to repeat the message thank you gaming kids in a

816
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:37,220
aim she obviously finds it very difficult to make content cuz she lives

817
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:41,740
with her family type thing and they make it a bit difficult so obviously I spoke

818
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:49,460
to her I'm like when when we did the interviews with the tips don't lie in

819
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:55,580
that hip fire don't miss I mean if we're gonna compliment my aim like that

820
01:21:55,580 --> 01:22:02,340
sure sure hey thank you the baby Lord Jody is slang for a dude who takes

821
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:05,980
advantage of the fact that the military members always only on deployment to

822
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:13,460
sleep with a spouse a Jody is a guy who takes care of your wife while you're

823
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:19,420
deployed geez that creates some brain worms in a half if everyone's on about

824
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:28,340
that in the military bunker Jody this Jody that Jody gonna go for a job Jody's

825
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:36,860
again it's basically oh no that's even wait imagine going away serving your

826
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:43,940
country and then I know it's copyright I don't give a shit we're enjoying this

827
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:54,940
people we're enjoying this one but it's gonna get copyrighted don't care it's

828
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:59,540
fine for any military personnel to have a partner slash family but they have to

829
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:02,940
understand it's difficult for them because if the call is made there is a

830
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:09,580
chance they may not return yeah that's what I thought an ono maybe good to see

831
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:19,380
you Jason Hudson CIA wait why is the music so quiet hold on a minute get that

832
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:35,980
shit oh it's not that much larger to be honest on my head set

833
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:53,180
back to 64 CIA gave a control of corporate operations it's still really quiet yeah

834
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:57,100
it's quite for me as well well time to say goodbye to the board after this dream

835
01:23:57,100 --> 01:24:03,820
no no no the bottle just get copyright and well it's not gonna get taken down

836
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:09,740
some yapping over and everything and we can prove that it was licensed by the

837
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:19,580
video game technically video games are not supposed to be claimed and because

838
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:25,380
they've been licensed by the producer like the publisher of the thing game so

839
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:32,340
Vods for game shouldn't be claimed but YouTube hasn't caught up with that it's

840
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:37,740
just a guy we ran over sorry bud about that didn't mean that sorry old chap let's

841
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:40,980
get you into the bunker shall we

842
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:48,140
alright alright alright did you know that a kitchen desktop in Scotland can be

843
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:56,700
called a bunker like when you ask like if the fruit balls on the bunker and you

844
01:24:56,700 --> 01:25:03,340
like put a board down and cut on it that's the bunker no like I was we ran

845
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:09,660
over someone else yeah I think they say there's a lot of like in friendly fire

846
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:13,740
in real life in the military but they kind of cover up because obviously no

847
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:19,500
one wants to be known for the one who got by

848
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:28,420
she's no one shot me only me with the the knife

849
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:41,580

857
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:42,700
I can't reverse under the tank what that's such a random detail you're not

858
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:46,020
allowed to reverse and wait not a replaying does that mean we get to go

859
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:50,540
on top of it yeah if you are replaying you get to go on top of me if you're not

me out just yet I know I'm your worst asset but don't

943
01:37:49,260 --> 01:38:03,380
carno carno hi carno ashite mashite what okay okay who driving this you need

944
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:08,540
to stabilize this I've not taken my anti sickness meds come on did you know

945
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:17,660
that in the Vietnam War a lot of soldiers came home with opioid addiction

946
01:38:17,660 --> 01:38:24,020
because in war they give like a lot of opioids and stuff to give people sorry

947
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:32,900
hold on hold on wait where's the other one where's the other one and they give

948
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:36,700
them to like deal with their nerves and stuff and or like drugs in general like

949
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:40,140
I think there's there was a report on like heroin like a lot straight up on

950
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:43,780
heroin because it's so nerve-racking to go into war but I think they used to do

951
01:38:43,780 --> 01:38:46,780
that in the past as well like everyone be like drugged up in somewhere or

952
01:38:46,780 --> 01:38:51,740
another I was rather interesting honestly maybe if I do my drug education

953
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:55,180
stream we could talk about it

954
01:38:59,780 --> 01:39:07,340
there is morphine in their med kit spamming the valkyrie rockets look I

955
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:10,220
don't know how much I just cost the government spamming that amount of

956
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:17,020
rockets and missing but sorry looks don't count break the siege in the

957
01:39:17,020 --> 01:39:19,860
battle of case

958
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:30,220
hydration check yeah crystal man so Vietnam was a war on drugs but the

959
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:40,180
wait that's why I don't think it is that what they made the Vietnam war

960
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:45,620
about they pretended it was about brown ice running chat how are you doing we're

961
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:52,220
putting your tinfoil hats on about the Vietnam war I don't I think that hard

962
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:59,980
to believe the it was more of a proxy war with the Soviet Union we would like

963
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:06,220
to congratulate drugs for winning the war on drugs round of applause to drugs

964
01:40:06,220 --> 01:40:10,580
the war on drugs was unrelated is that how they framed it though no it was

965
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:16,100
because of the feeding I mean didn't we go in because of a domino theory the

966
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:21,180
factor no name is a proxy warbook

967
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:28,540
we're here to yank a defector with vital intel on drug addiction action that's

968
01:40:28,540 --> 01:40:34,820
right and today we're gonna rate cocaine versus heroin all right cocaine

969
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:39,020
instantly I feel an ego boost

970
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:50,420
could the tear ranking live as terrible anyway anyway I'm actually I'm

971
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:53,900
Scottish I'm allowed to make jokes about drugs okay if you didn't know

972
01:40:53,900 --> 01:41:01,420
Scotland has the highest drugs deaths in Europe I think we're all predispositions

973
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:06,620
due to depression oh my god it's the gun name that you're not allowed to say in

974
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:12,580
Britain oh you're not allowed to say this gun name in Britain because it's an

975
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:17,540
insult but I'm gonna say it because I'm talking about the gun and I don't use

976
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:33,180
this terminology oh my god we have we have flame ammo incinerate ammo that's

977
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:42,780

geez this gun is feral monk oh what drink can we get oh this is cigarette

981
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:12,580
well we won't use the British terminology for cigarettes either cuz that

982
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:17,300
would get me done for me I'm actually surprised I've not slipped up on stream

983
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:24,940
cuz that my obviously it's just normal in Britain and my mom smokes and like we

984
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:33,420
use that terminology but you know let's say it because everyone thinks oh yeah

985
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:38,940
according to the US dragon breath is still Kobe wait dragon breath is still

987
01:42:48,180 --> 01:42:52,220
that real dragon breath is the actual name of the ammo type and it's not against

988
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:54,780
the convention

1149
02:02:42,540 --> 02:02:48,580
why I'm walking on rooftops in the city of Kowloon that no longer exists because

1150
02:02:48,580 --> 02:02:53,020
they tore it down but it was the most densely packed populated area ever

1151
02:02:53,020 --> 02:03:03,220
recorded in history and I don't think they're ever doing it again because I'm

1152
02:03:03,220 --> 02:03:06,460
so glad I have like the ability to sponge so many bullets because it would be

1153
02:03:06,460 --> 02:03:10,540
over for me if I was playing there and I never did look up gameplay of Halo and

1154

Oh my god.

Well, we know why he doesn't like all that much, huh?

1444
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:32,160
Thank you for the, uh, Super Shadow Boogaloo.

1445
02:42:32,160 --> 02:42:34,160
That was so sad.

1446
02:42:34,160 --> 02:42:39,160
So we got in here, and now we have to frickin' battle.

1447
02:42:39,160 --> 02:42:42,160
Are we against the bridge?

1448
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:45,160
Who? You.

1449
02:42:45,160 --> 02:42:50,160
The British are coming. The British are coming.

1450
02:42:50,160 --> 02:42:51,160
Monk, monk.

1451
02:42:51,160 --> 02:42:52,160
Ah!

1452
02:42:52,160 --> 02:42:59,160
What?

1453
02:42:59,160 --> 02:43:05,160
What? So like they slipped away with the, the, the billet as a...

1454
02:43:05,160 --> 02:43:07,160
The recipe to make Nova 6.

1455
02:43:07,160 --> 02:43:10,160
Stop dropping down! Go home!

1456
02:43:10,160 --> 02:43:15,160
Go home! Go, go back to whatever part of London you came from.

1457
02:43:15,160 --> 02:43:16,160
Jeez.

1458
02:43:16,160 --> 02:43:18,160
Go away.

1459
02:43:18,160 --> 02:43:20,160
Oh! There's a timer now! Goodbye!

1460
02:43:20,160 --> 02:43:22,160
I'm not dealing with any of this. Bye.

1461
02:43:22,160 --> 02:43:24,160
Where'd I go? Where'd I go? Where'd I go?

1462
02:43:24,160 --> 02:43:25,160
The pipe! The pipe! Ah, by the way.

1463
02:43:25,160 --> 02:43:26,160
Yes, of course I climbed the pipe.

1464
02:43:26,160 --> 02:43:28,160
Let me up the pipe. Let me up the pipe!

1465
02:43:28,160 --> 02:43:30,160
Let me up the pipe.

1466
02:43:30,160 --> 02:43:33,160
How'd I get up the pipe? What?

1467
02:43:33,160 --> 02:43:34,160
Okay. Okay.

1468
02:43:34,160 --> 02:43:35,160
Okay, I figured it out.

1469
02:43:35,160 --> 02:43:36,160
Let's figure it out.

1470
02:43:36,160 --> 02:43:38,160
Right, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1471
02:43:38,160 --> 02:43:40,160
This place is going to blow. You guys don't want to be here.

1472
02:43:40,160 --> 02:43:41,160
I promise you, I'll just lead C4.

1473
02:43:41,160 --> 02:43:44,160
Guys, please evacuate at the next possible moment.

1474
02:43:44,160 --> 02:43:46,160
I planted C4 and I admit it.

1475
02:43:46,160 --> 02:43:49,160
I have planted C4. I have planted very severe.

1476
02:43:49,160 --> 02:43:51,160
Big boom. Boom.

1477
02:43:51,160 --> 02:43:53,160
I don't know if that translates into English

1478
02:43:53,160 --> 02:43:55,160
because I'm speaking Russian right now technically.

1479
02:43:55,160 --> 02:43:57,160
Big boom.

1480
02:43:57,160 --> 02:43:59,160
Big boom. Boom.

1481
02:43:59,160 --> 02:44:01,160
Boom.

1482
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:08,160
You all want to get off the ship.

1483
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:11,160
Evacuate the ship at the nearest exit point on the ship.

1484
02:44:11,160 --> 02:44:13,160
You would like to evacuate.

1485
02:44:13,160 --> 02:44:15,160
I'm away. Bye. It's your problem now.

1486
02:44:15,160 --> 02:44:16,160
Whee!

1487
02:44:16,160 --> 02:44:18,160
Can you do that by hand if the rope is frozen?

1488
02:44:18,160 --> 02:44:21,160
I suppose he has gloves on so it doesn't count.

1489
02:44:23,160 --> 02:44:25,160
Oh, are we going alright?

1490
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:33,160
I planted it from falling into the hands of the British.

1491
02:44:33,160 --> 02:44:35,160
Bunk!

1492
02:44:35,160 --> 02:44:37,160
Right on my forehead.

1493
02:44:37,160 --> 02:44:39,160
It was only after I was captured.

1494
02:44:39,160 --> 02:44:41,160
Oh, let's translate it for the brief.

1495
02:44:41,160 --> 02:44:43,160
Big ship is going to...

1496
02:44:43,160 --> 02:44:45,160
Big boom in it. Yeah?

1497
02:44:45,160 --> 02:44:47,160
Get me now, fam.

1498
02:44:47,160 --> 02:44:49,160
I'm going to get up and run at that point.

1499
02:44:49,160 --> 02:44:51,160
I'm going to get up and run at that point.

1500
02:44:51,160 --> 02:44:53,160
I'm going to get up and run at that point.

1501
02:44:53,160 --> 02:44:55,160
I'm going to get up and run at that point.

1502
02:44:55,160 --> 02:44:57,160
I'm going to get up and run at that point.

1503
02:44:57,160 --> 02:44:59,160
Man.

1504
02:44:59,160 --> 02:45:01,160
I'm listening.

1505
02:45:01,160 --> 02:45:03,160
Yeah.

1506
02:45:19,160 --> 02:45:21,160
Give me a tin foil hat.

1507
02:45:21,160 --> 02:45:23,160
There's no...

1508
02:45:23,160 --> 02:45:25,160
I will be one with you.

1509
02:45:25,160 --> 02:45:27,160
Steiner.

1510
02:45:27,160 --> 02:45:29,160
Man.

1511
02:45:29,160 --> 02:45:31,160
Must die.

1512
02:45:33,160 --> 02:45:35,160
Someone's never healed.

1513
02:45:35,160 --> 02:45:37,160
Escape the pair.

1514
02:45:37,160 --> 02:45:39,160
Should I keep panting like that?

1515
02:45:39,160 --> 02:45:41,160
What the...

1516
02:45:41,160 --> 02:45:43,160
Did you know when you get a military exam?

1517
02:45:43,160 --> 02:45:45,160
If it's a lady and you get a bonbon

1518
02:45:45,160 --> 02:45:47,160
she'll flick your tip out of nowhere

1519
02:45:47,160 --> 02:45:49,160
to stop the blood full gun from there.

1520
02:45:49,160 --> 02:45:51,160
You're welcome, Nino.

1521
02:45:55,160 --> 02:45:57,160
Yo, that PNG ready? Huh?

1522
02:45:59,160 --> 02:46:01,160
If America ever got their hands on a weapon like that

1523
02:46:01,160 --> 02:46:03,160
you know they'd use it.

1524
02:46:05,160 --> 02:46:07,160
Oh, that's such a good way to say it.

1525
02:46:07,160 --> 02:46:09,160
What?

1526
02:46:09,160 --> 02:46:11,160
Cucumb...

1527
02:46:11,160 --> 02:46:13,160
Is that a pickle or a cucumber emoji?

1528
02:46:13,160 --> 02:46:15,160
Cucumber spank, basically.

1529
02:46:15,160 --> 02:46:17,160
Stop it!

1530
02:46:17,160 --> 02:46:19,160
It's turning me on!

1531
02:46:19,160 --> 02:46:21,160
Nah, we're playing Call of Duty.

1532
02:46:21,160 --> 02:46:23,160
Don't get turned on.

1533
02:46:23,160 --> 02:46:25,160
Maybe I can palvel of you to get

1534
02:46:25,160 --> 02:46:27,160
blood flow if I pan.

1535
02:46:31,160 --> 02:46:33,160
Please excuse me for being a ghost.

1536
02:46:35,160 --> 02:46:37,160
They ain't loaded in yet.

1537
02:46:39,160 --> 02:46:41,160
You've already done that.

1538
02:46:43,160 --> 02:46:45,160
What's happening?

1539
02:46:47,160 --> 02:46:49,160
Congrats for your names, David.

1540
02:46:53,160 --> 02:46:55,160
My leg! I'm bleeding!

1541
02:46:55,160 --> 02:46:57,160
I need some help here!

1542
02:46:59,160 --> 02:47:01,160
They're coming!

1543
02:47:09,160 --> 02:47:11,160
Can you open up? Wood's a bit faster?

1544
02:47:11,160 --> 02:47:13,160
I think you have to be fully submerged

1545
02:47:13,160 --> 02:47:15,160
in order for doors to be open under water.

1546
02:47:17,160 --> 02:47:19,160
Come on, Woods.

1547
02:47:19,160 --> 02:47:21,160
Waitin' on you, buddy.

1548
02:47:21,160 --> 02:47:23,160
Can you take over? Alright, Dad London,

1549
02:47:23,160 --> 02:47:25,160
you mind me?

1550
02:47:25,160 --> 02:47:27,160
I'm spammin' it!

1551
02:47:27,160 --> 02:47:29,160
I'm spammin' it!

1552
02:47:35,160 --> 02:47:37,160
I like how the first time I played this game

1553
02:47:37,160 --> 02:47:39,160
I never noticed the numbers every time he showed up.

1554
02:47:41,160 --> 02:47:43,160
Okay.

1555
02:47:43,160 --> 02:47:45,160
Time to perish!

1556
02:47:47,160 --> 02:47:49,160
I love hipfire!

1557
02:47:49,160 --> 02:47:51,160
Oh, no, I don't...

1558
02:47:55,160 --> 02:47:57,160
Well...

1559
02:47:57,160 --> 02:47:59,160
Where are we going?

1560
02:48:07,160 --> 02:48:09,160
Where am I going?

1561
02:48:11,160 --> 02:48:13,160
I don't know what to do.

1562
02:48:13,160 --> 02:48:15,160
Am I supposed to go where he is?

1563
02:48:15,160 --> 02:48:17,160
I think so.

1564
02:48:19,160 --> 02:48:21,160
Oh my god, underwater ragdoll physics?

1565
02:48:23,160 --> 02:48:25,160
Okay, yeah. I'm to go up, River.

1566
02:48:25,160 --> 02:48:27,160
Got it.

1567
02:48:27,160 --> 02:48:29,160
The bullet went invisible.

1568
02:48:29,160 --> 02:48:31,160
Anima bullets!

1569
02:48:31,160 --> 02:48:33,160
Anima bullets!

1570
02:48:33,160 --> 02:48:35,160
Me when I miss all my targets.

1571
02:48:35,160 --> 02:48:37,160
Anima bullets!

1572
02:48:37,160 --> 02:48:39,160
Anima bullets!

1573
02:48:39,160 --> 02:48:41,160
Anima bullets!

1574
02:48:45,160 --> 02:48:47,160
No, no, no. I want the AK.

1575
02:48:47,160 --> 02:48:49,160
I prefer the AK. I like it.

1576
02:48:49,160 --> 02:48:51,160
It's a staple in any war zone!

1577
02:48:51,160 --> 02:48:53,160
That's terrible!

1578
02:48:53,160 --> 02:48:55,160
But it is.

1579
02:48:57,160 --> 02:48:59,160
Sometimes you can't just see things that way.

1580
02:49:09,160 --> 02:49:11,160
Got my knife, yeah.

1581
02:49:17,160 --> 02:49:19,160
RPGs, AK on steroids.

1582
02:49:19,160 --> 02:49:21,160
The recoil is too much for me.

1583
02:49:21,160 --> 02:49:23,160
I'm like a baby recoil.

1584
02:49:23,160 --> 02:49:25,160
The AK!

1585
02:49:27,160 --> 02:49:29,160
No noise, got it.

1586
02:49:29,160 --> 02:49:31,160
Got it.

1587
02:49:33,160 --> 02:49:35,160
Swimming in the rain.

1588
02:49:39,160 --> 02:49:41,160
You want to do it or am I doing it?

1589
02:49:41,160 --> 02:49:43,160
Am I doing it? Fine. I'll do it.

1590
02:49:43,160 --> 02:49:45,160
Jeez, since you want to...

1591
02:49:45,160 --> 02:49:47,160
I don't know how we're doing this.

1592
02:49:47,160 --> 02:49:49,160
I hope I don't drown by the time I get there.

1593
02:49:51,160 --> 02:49:53,160
Oh my god!

1594
02:49:53,160 --> 02:49:55,160
Oh my god, eel vtuber confirmed for Jentu.

1595
02:49:57,160 --> 02:49:59,160
Surprise!

1596
02:49:59,160 --> 02:50:01,160
See, I win when we're in the water.

1597
02:50:01,160 --> 02:50:03,160
Because I am a water vtuber.

1598
02:50:03,160 --> 02:50:05,160
Who's that vtuber type?

1599
02:50:05,160 --> 02:50:07,160
It's a water type!

1600
02:50:09,160 --> 02:50:11,160
Fuck!

1601
02:50:11,160 --> 02:50:13,160
Okay, where now?

1602
02:50:13,160 --> 02:50:15,160
Oh, I see him.

1603
02:50:15,160 --> 02:50:17,160
Eels creep me out.

1604
02:50:17,160 --> 02:50:19,160
You wouldn't want an eel girl

1605
02:50:19,160 --> 02:50:21,160
to wrap her tail around it.

1606
02:50:23,160 --> 02:50:25,160
And then...

1607
02:50:25,160 --> 02:50:27,160
Because she can ear lick it at the same time.

1608
02:50:33,160 --> 02:50:35,160
Wait, where am I going?

1609
02:50:35,160 --> 02:50:37,160
Give me my mom.

1610
02:50:37,160 --> 02:50:39,160
Uh...

1611
02:50:41,160 --> 02:50:43,160
Yes, yes.

1612
02:50:43,160 --> 02:50:45,160
Croft gen.

1613
02:50:51,160 --> 02:50:53,160
The hornets.

1614
02:50:55,160 --> 02:50:57,160
It shocked me today.

1615
02:50:57,160 --> 02:50:59,160
That would be epic.

1616
02:50:59,160 --> 02:51:01,160
Oh, you have a point.

1617
02:51:01,160 --> 02:51:03,160
Pachinko! The head Japanese Gamba game!

1618
02:51:03,160 --> 02:51:05,160
Did you know?

1619
02:51:05,160 --> 02:51:07,160
It's illegal to Gamba in Japan.

1620
02:51:07,160 --> 02:51:09,160
So in order to get your earnings,

1621
02:51:09,160 --> 02:51:11,160
you like get a gold token

1622
02:51:11,160 --> 02:51:13,160
that's worth money or something to get around it.

1623
02:51:13,160 --> 02:51:15,160
Rather strange, honestly.

1624
02:51:15,160 --> 02:51:17,160
Destroy the ZPU,

1625
02:51:17,160 --> 02:51:19,160
place C4,

1626
02:51:19,160 --> 02:51:21,160
mission of...

1627
02:51:21,160 --> 02:51:23,160
Don't mind me boys, I'm all for this one.

1628
02:51:27,160 --> 02:51:29,160
See, I'm in my element in the water.

1629
02:51:29,160 --> 02:51:31,160
You guys, you have to hold your breath and stuff.

1630
02:51:31,160 --> 02:51:33,160
Me?

1631
02:51:35,160 --> 02:51:37,160
Did I start drowning there?

1632
02:51:43,160 --> 02:51:45,160
Wouldn't you be glad to see me or something?

1633
02:51:45,160 --> 02:51:47,160
I don't know, she's got fun with the same.

1634
02:51:49,160 --> 02:51:51,160
I've been bitten so hard by an eel,

1635
02:51:51,160 --> 02:51:53,160
I had to go to the hospital.

1636
02:51:53,160 --> 02:51:55,160
How are you in a...

1637
02:51:55,160 --> 02:51:57,160
situation

1638
02:51:57,160 --> 02:51:59,160
that an eel got to you?

1639
02:51:59,160 --> 02:52:01,160
I'm too scared to swim in open water.

1640
02:52:01,160 --> 02:52:03,160
Why are they still drowning in a Nuzlocke stream?

1641
02:52:05,160 --> 02:52:07,160
I'm doing Pokemon soon.

1642
02:52:07,160 --> 02:52:09,160
Pokemon's on the roster.

1643
02:52:09,160 --> 02:52:11,160
And then Pokemon will be...

1644
02:52:11,160 --> 02:52:13,160
I know...

1645
02:52:13,160 --> 02:52:15,160
Generation 3 born.

1646
02:52:15,160 --> 02:52:17,160
Okay.

1647
02:52:21,160 --> 02:52:23,160
I don't need a small amount of war crimes.

1648
02:52:23,160 --> 02:52:25,160
I recommend it.

1649
02:52:25,160 --> 02:52:27,160
Although, I feel like everything becomes...

1650
02:52:27,160 --> 02:52:29,160
a little bit more...

1651
02:52:29,160 --> 02:52:31,160
Although, I feel like everything becomes like...

1652
02:52:31,160 --> 02:52:33,160
permissive in terms of like...

1653
02:52:33,160 --> 02:52:35,160
Oh, that's dangerous.

1654
02:52:39,160 --> 02:52:41,160
Silently take out three...

1655
02:52:41,160 --> 02:52:43,160
VCs.

1656
02:52:43,160 --> 02:52:45,160
Voice chat.

1657
02:52:49,160 --> 02:52:51,160
I won't let me in the water?

1658
02:52:51,160 --> 02:52:53,160
Oh, because I don't have to go in the water.

1659
02:52:55,160 --> 02:52:57,160
Achievement.

1660
02:52:57,160 --> 02:52:59,160
Let me open this gate.

1661
02:52:59,160 --> 02:53:01,160
A water gate.

1662
02:53:01,160 --> 02:53:03,160
Terrible.

1663
02:53:03,160 --> 02:53:05,160
Let's hide.

1664
02:53:05,160 --> 02:53:07,160
I'm hiding in the water.

1665
02:53:07,160 --> 02:53:09,160
They don't see me sneaking.

1666
02:53:09,160 --> 02:53:11,160
Ooh!

1667
02:53:11,160 --> 02:53:13,160
I mean, I am safe in the water.

1668
02:53:13,160 --> 02:53:15,160
Dandan.

1669
02:53:15,160 --> 02:53:17,160
Dandan.

1670
02:53:17,160 --> 02:53:19,160
Dandan.

1671
02:53:19,160 --> 02:53:21,160
Dandan.

1672
02:53:21,160 --> 02:53:23,160
Chickens!

1673
02:53:23,160 --> 02:53:25,160
Over on the farm.

1674
02:53:25,160 --> 02:53:27,160
Hi, chickens!

1675
02:53:27,160 --> 02:53:29,160
Would you like to...

1676
02:53:29,160 --> 02:53:31,160
Oh, no, your roosters.

1677
02:53:31,160 --> 02:53:33,160
The roosters don't lay eggs like hens.

1678
02:53:37,160 --> 02:53:39,160
It's time.

1679
02:53:39,160 --> 02:53:41,160
I have the fire skin on the commando.

1680
02:53:41,160 --> 02:53:43,160
I'm not that I'm showing off a multiplayer skin.

1681
02:53:43,160 --> 02:53:45,160
So you can get...

1682
02:53:49,160 --> 02:53:51,160
How do you guys always have RPGs?

1683
02:53:51,160 --> 02:53:53,160
Aren't those...

1684
02:53:53,160 --> 02:53:55,160
Aren't RPGs expensive to manufacture?

1685
02:53:57,160 --> 02:53:59,160
How does everyone afford weapons?

1686
02:54:01,160 --> 02:54:03,160
Okay, let's play it a wee bit more safe.

1687
02:54:03,160 --> 02:54:05,160
As much as it pains me

1688
02:54:05,160 --> 02:54:07,160
to hold back from Rootie2e

1689
02:54:07,160 --> 02:54:09,160
shooty aimbot.

1690
02:54:09,160 --> 02:54:11,160
Oh, no, this is survivor.

1691
02:54:11,160 --> 02:54:13,160
Sorry. I didn't realize there was...

1692
02:54:13,160 --> 02:54:15,160
villagers.

1693
02:54:15,160 --> 02:54:17,160
Okay, let's not hurt the villagers.

1694
02:54:17,160 --> 02:54:19,160
The villagers...

1695
02:54:19,160 --> 02:54:21,160
Oh, I got the RPG guy.

1696
02:54:21,160 --> 02:54:23,160
That was him. He was the one...

1697
02:54:23,160 --> 02:54:25,160
No, we had to start walking

1698
02:54:25,160 --> 02:54:27,160
in front of my bullets.

1699
02:54:27,160 --> 02:54:29,160
I swear.

1700
02:54:29,160 --> 02:54:31,160
That's all they want to do.

1701
02:54:31,160 --> 02:54:33,160
See, you just did it again.

1702
02:54:33,160 --> 02:54:35,160
And then you're going to blame me.

1703
02:54:35,160 --> 02:54:37,160
Why am I getting the blame?

1704
02:54:39,160 --> 02:54:41,160
I'm a good...

1705
02:54:41,160 --> 02:54:43,160
war person.

1706
02:54:45,160 --> 02:54:47,160
I try and give people the benefit

1707
02:54:47,160 --> 02:54:49,160
of the doubt when they're springing and preying, okay?

1708
02:54:53,160 --> 02:54:55,160
Also me who walks right in front of the E.I.

1709
02:54:55,160 --> 02:54:57,160
Ooh! Ooh!

1710
02:54:57,160 --> 02:54:59,160
I'm not throwing it back.

1711
02:54:59,160 --> 02:55:01,160
Sorry, I'd rather let it explode.

1712
02:55:01,160 --> 02:55:03,160
What am I to do?

1713
02:55:05,160 --> 02:55:07,160
Charlie on the right!

1714
02:55:11,160 --> 02:55:13,160
Give me this. Give me it.

1715
02:55:17,160 --> 02:55:19,160
You see it? 1-0.

1716
02:55:19,160 --> 02:55:21,160
Next is empty. Objective clear.

1717
02:55:25,160 --> 02:55:27,160
This seems like overkill

1718
02:55:27,160 --> 02:55:29,160
for a wooden bolt.

1719
02:55:29,160 --> 02:55:31,160
Come on. This is overkill.

1720
02:55:31,160 --> 02:55:33,160
Isn't it?

1721
02:55:35,160 --> 02:55:37,160
Isn't this just a way back to...

1722
02:55:37,160 --> 02:55:39,160
Oh, this main?

1723
02:55:39,160 --> 02:55:41,160
Here is clear.

1724
02:55:45,160 --> 02:55:47,160
Okay, okay.

1725
02:55:49,160 --> 02:55:51,160
What am I doing?

1726
02:55:51,160 --> 02:55:53,160
I'm going this way. Why yes, of course.

1727
02:55:53,160 --> 02:55:55,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1728
02:55:55,160 --> 02:55:57,160
Something's pushed me forward.

1729
02:55:57,160 --> 02:55:59,160
Who's pushing me forward?

1730
02:55:59,160 --> 02:56:01,160
I got pushed into that gunfire.

1731
02:56:03,160 --> 02:56:05,160
I got pushed.

1732
02:56:05,160 --> 02:56:07,160
That doesn't count as a death animation.

1733
02:56:07,160 --> 02:56:09,160
Ow! I've been freaking spawned in properly.

1734
02:56:13,160 --> 02:56:15,160
Fuck you, bitch.

1735
02:56:17,160 --> 02:56:19,160
Only 15 deaths.

1736
02:56:19,160 --> 02:56:21,160
Come on, you so saw me getting pushed forward, right?

1737
02:56:21,160 --> 02:56:23,160
I'm not going crazy.

1738
02:56:23,160 --> 02:56:25,160
Because you think I'm crazy.

1739
02:56:29,160 --> 02:56:31,160
Because you think I'm crazy.

1740
02:56:31,160 --> 02:56:33,160
But I'm actually...

1741
02:56:33,160 --> 02:56:35,160
Just a war killer.

1742
02:56:35,160 --> 02:56:37,160
What?

1743
02:56:37,160 --> 02:56:39,160
I'm getting obliterated.

1744
02:56:39,160 --> 02:56:41,160
Do not block that grenade, I'll cry.

1745
02:56:43,160 --> 02:56:45,160
Right, how about what do you use to it?

1746
02:56:45,160 --> 02:56:47,160
Who's always me?

1747
02:56:47,160 --> 02:56:49,160
Sorry, how is it always me?

1748
02:56:49,160 --> 02:56:51,160
They wonder, they're like,

1749
02:56:51,160 --> 02:56:53,160
oh, Mason, you're the best soldiers we've ever had.

1750
02:56:53,160 --> 02:56:55,160
I am the only one aiming,

1751
02:56:55,160 --> 02:56:57,160
that's why you cheeky.

1752
02:56:57,160 --> 02:56:59,160
Cheeky bam.

1753
02:56:59,160 --> 02:57:01,160
Cheeky wee bam pot, honestly.

1754
02:57:01,160 --> 02:57:03,160
Look at that hipfire aimbot, come on.

1755
02:57:03,160 --> 02:57:05,160
Cut, you think Bowman has that hipfire aimbot?

1756
02:57:05,160 --> 02:57:07,160
No, he doesn't.

1757
02:57:07,160 --> 02:57:09,160
No, he doesn't. Cheeky.

1758
02:57:09,160 --> 02:57:11,160
Absolutely cheeky.

1759
02:57:11,160 --> 02:57:13,160
Right, we're going in the whole reeflings.

1760
02:57:13,160 --> 02:57:15,160
Time to loop up.

1761
02:57:15,160 --> 02:57:17,160
And before you, like, what are you on about?

1762
02:57:17,160 --> 02:57:19,160
We're going in here, okay?

1763
02:57:19,160 --> 02:57:21,160
We're going in here.

1764
02:57:21,160 --> 02:57:23,160
We're going in here.

1765
02:57:23,160 --> 02:57:25,160
Right, oh.

1766
02:57:27,160 --> 02:57:29,160
Now when I say,

1767
02:57:29,160 --> 02:57:31,160
I wanna, like, annihilate your hole.

1768
02:57:31,160 --> 02:57:33,160
I don't mean it that badly.

1769
02:57:33,160 --> 02:57:35,160
Our grenade is a bit much.

1770
02:57:37,160 --> 02:57:39,160
Whatever.

1771
02:57:39,160 --> 02:57:41,160
Into the tunnels.

1772
02:57:45,160 --> 02:57:47,160
Oh, the numbers.

1773
02:57:51,160 --> 02:57:53,160
Okay.

1774
02:57:53,160 --> 02:57:55,160
Did you...

1775
02:57:55,160 --> 02:57:57,160
No, press shift

1776
02:57:57,160 --> 02:57:59,160
to turn on the flashlight.

1777
02:57:59,160 --> 02:58:01,160
I have.

1778
02:58:03,160 --> 02:58:05,160
Ooh.

1779
02:58:11,160 --> 02:58:13,160
Oh wait, this glitch happened

1780
02:58:13,160 --> 02:58:15,160
last time as well.

1781
02:58:17,160 --> 02:58:19,160
Not fair with the little.

1782
02:58:19,160 --> 02:58:21,160
The, the shaders

1783
02:58:21,160 --> 02:58:23,160
break.

1784
02:58:23,160 --> 02:58:25,160
They, like, completely break.

1785
02:58:25,160 --> 02:58:27,160
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1786
02:58:27,160 --> 02:58:29,160
Like, he's not...

1787
02:58:31,160 --> 02:58:33,160
I don't know.

1788
02:58:33,160 --> 02:58:35,160
I don't know what broken he...

1789
02:58:35,160 --> 02:58:37,160
It's coming.

1790
02:58:37,160 --> 02:58:39,160
It's with dad. We got V.C. calling all over.

1791
02:58:39,160 --> 02:58:41,160
Amen. Amen.

1792
02:58:41,160 --> 02:58:43,160
Did I get him killed? Cause I was mucking about with my flashlight.

1793
02:58:43,160 --> 02:58:45,160
Do you monitor?

1794
02:58:45,160 --> 02:58:47,160
Whoopsies.

1795
02:58:47,160 --> 02:58:49,160
He's a skinwalker.

1796
02:58:49,160 --> 02:58:51,160
Honestly, at least it's with us.

1797
02:58:51,160 --> 02:58:53,160
Sorry.

1798
02:58:53,160 --> 02:58:55,160
I can't...

1799
02:58:55,160 --> 02:58:57,160
I actually have to play with the flashlight off

1800
02:58:57,160 --> 02:58:59,160
to see them better than with the on.

1801
02:58:59,160 --> 02:59:01,160
I mean, I don't even mind.

1802
02:59:03,160 --> 02:59:05,160
Hi, Rizzo.

1803
02:59:05,160 --> 02:59:07,160
Can you guys still see those?

1804
02:59:11,160 --> 02:59:13,160
I can... No, I think he's...

1805
02:59:13,160 --> 02:59:15,160
They lost their textures.

1806
02:59:17,160 --> 02:59:19,160
Dead and lost his texture?

1807
02:59:19,160 --> 02:59:21,160
That's even worse.

1808
02:59:21,160 --> 02:59:23,160
Okay, I'll help you move it.

1809
02:59:23,160 --> 02:59:25,160
Oh, sorry, I'm on the floor.

1810
02:59:29,160 --> 02:59:31,160
Yeah, we can still see.

1811
02:59:31,160 --> 02:59:33,160
As long as you can see them.

1812
02:59:33,160 --> 02:59:35,160
I guess that's all but marry.

1813
02:59:39,160 --> 02:59:41,160
I was gonna say, damn, he took a shot in the hip.

1814
02:59:41,160 --> 02:59:43,160
I mean, he took a shot in the hip.

1815
02:59:49,160 --> 02:59:51,160
Rather efficient, Rizzo.

1816
02:59:51,160 --> 02:59:53,160
Very good technique.

1817
02:59:53,160 --> 02:59:55,160
Yes, yes, 10 out of 10.

1818
03:00:07,160 --> 03:00:09,160
Did he take a different path?

1819
03:00:11,160 --> 03:00:13,160
I see you.

1820
03:00:15,160 --> 03:00:17,160
I see you.

1821
03:00:19,160 --> 03:00:21,160
Sorry, this is like a horror game right now.

1822
03:00:21,160 --> 03:00:23,160
I'm reloading after every shot so I can spam

1823
03:00:23,160 --> 03:00:25,160
in case I muck up.

1824
03:00:31,160 --> 03:00:33,160
I wonder if they can't see me either in the tunnel.

1825
03:00:33,160 --> 03:00:35,160
I remember seeing an account

1826
03:00:35,160 --> 03:00:37,160
of tunnel warfare.

1827
03:00:37,160 --> 03:00:39,160
Oh, I shot off his leg perfectly.

1828
03:00:39,160 --> 03:00:41,160
That's really gross.

1829
03:00:41,160 --> 03:00:43,160
That ain't the most dying solid team.

1830
03:00:53,160 --> 03:00:55,160
Hello, daddy's home.

1831
03:00:59,160 --> 03:01:01,160
I can't stand up now.

1832
03:01:01,160 --> 03:01:03,160
The pysons are bad.

1833
03:01:03,160 --> 03:01:05,160
Gasp, gasp, gasp.

1834
03:01:07,160 --> 03:01:09,160
Quick, grab the documents.

1835
03:01:09,160 --> 03:01:11,160
Can we grab the documents?

1836
03:01:13,160 --> 03:01:15,160
Aren't we supposed to grab the documents?

1837
03:01:25,160 --> 03:01:27,160
I'm crawling as a main chef.

1838
03:01:27,160 --> 03:01:29,160
Crawly, crawly, crawl.

1839
03:01:37,160 --> 03:01:39,160
Come on.

1840
03:01:41,160 --> 03:01:43,160
Press V.

1841
03:01:43,160 --> 03:01:45,160
I'm digging a hole.

1842
03:01:45,160 --> 03:01:47,160
I'm digging out the hole.

1843
03:01:47,160 --> 03:01:49,160
We made it, we made it.

1844
03:01:49,160 --> 03:01:51,160
No, no, no, I don't like that.

1845
03:01:51,160 --> 03:01:53,160
Oh my god, that activated the actual thing in me.

1846
03:01:55,160 --> 03:01:57,160
I get tunnel vision when I play games.

1847
03:01:57,160 --> 03:01:59,160
I'm not kidding.

1848
03:01:59,160 --> 03:02:01,160
Oh thank god.

1849
03:02:01,160 --> 03:02:03,160
Bring us close.

1850
03:02:03,160 --> 03:02:05,160
I was like so well done.

1851
03:02:09,160 --> 03:02:11,160
Did the shadow people try to kill you in Vietnam, Mason?

1852
03:02:17,160 --> 03:02:19,160
I don't know what section in the campaign we're in,

1853
03:02:19,160 --> 03:02:21,160
but I feel like we're kind of getting there.

1854
03:02:21,160 --> 03:02:23,160
I don't know how many levels.

1855
03:02:23,160 --> 03:02:25,160
I know there's one level and it goes,

1856
03:02:25,160 --> 03:02:27,160
we're on a boat and it goes down,

1857
03:02:27,160 --> 03:02:29,160
down, down.

1858
03:02:33,160 --> 03:02:35,160
Listen to me carefully, Mason.

1859
03:02:35,160 --> 03:02:37,160
Hydrogation check.

1860
03:02:37,160 --> 03:02:39,160
I've almost finished my bottle of water.

1861
03:02:39,160 --> 03:02:41,160
I'm so hydrated.

1862
03:02:41,160 --> 03:02:43,160
No matter what he tells you.

1863
03:02:43,160 --> 03:02:45,160
No matter what he tells you.

1864
03:02:45,160 --> 03:02:47,160
No matter what he tells you.

1865
03:02:47,160 --> 03:02:49,160
He gave us the Darcy Ion Clark.

1866
03:02:49,160 --> 03:02:51,160
He let us to Nova 6.

1867
03:02:51,160 --> 03:02:53,160
If you thought that was time.

1868
03:02:53,160 --> 03:02:55,160
He's my friend.

1869
03:02:55,160 --> 03:02:57,160
He helped me escape.

1870
03:02:57,160 --> 03:02:59,160
Are you squiddin' me right now?

1871
03:02:59,160 --> 03:03:01,160
Time to head back to work.

1872
03:03:01,160 --> 03:03:03,160
But I hope you enjoy it.

1873
03:03:03,160 --> 03:03:05,160
Thanks for spending your break with me.

1874
03:03:05,160 --> 03:03:07,160
Thank you.

1875
03:03:07,160 --> 03:03:09,160
Who the fuck are you anyway?

1876
03:03:09,160 --> 03:03:11,160
Make sure you hydrate at work.

1877
03:03:11,160 --> 03:03:13,160
Make sure you rest after work.

1878
03:03:13,160 --> 03:03:15,160
And make sure you prepare for your 30 minute

1879
03:03:15,160 --> 03:03:17,160
decompressed job after work.

1880
03:03:17,160 --> 03:03:19,160
When you get home.

1881
03:03:21,160 --> 03:03:23,160
I've been brainwashed.

1882
03:03:23,160 --> 03:03:25,160
I don't know the numbers mean something.

1883
03:03:31,160 --> 03:03:33,160
Wow.

1884
03:03:49,160 --> 03:03:51,160
Oh, this is literally the mission I was thinking of.

1885
03:03:55,160 --> 03:03:57,160
They're the next lottery numbers.

1886
03:04:01,160 --> 03:04:03,160
Okay.

1887
03:04:03,160 --> 03:04:05,160
This is literally the mission I was talking about.

1888
03:04:05,160 --> 03:04:07,160
Are you ready for some music?

1889
03:04:11,160 --> 03:04:13,160
As they start to realize.

1890
03:04:13,160 --> 03:04:15,160
Realize.

1891
03:04:15,160 --> 03:04:17,160
Realize.

1892
03:04:17,160 --> 03:04:19,160
Okay.

1893
03:04:19,160 --> 03:04:21,160
Enough with the white backgrounds.

1894
03:04:21,160 --> 03:04:23,160
Okay.

1895
03:04:23,160 --> 03:04:25,160
I can hardly see them.

1896
03:04:25,160 --> 03:04:27,160
I'm like looking in my eyes.

1897
03:04:27,160 --> 03:04:29,160
Oh, I hear the numbers.

1898
03:04:29,160 --> 03:04:31,160
They're becoming a lot more prevalent.

1899
03:04:31,160 --> 03:04:33,160
Mason in 1968.

1900
03:04:33,160 --> 03:04:35,160
Did you know the men landing

1901
03:04:35,160 --> 03:04:37,160
was 1969?

1902
03:04:41,160 --> 03:04:43,160
Wait, is this not the mission?

1903
03:04:43,160 --> 03:04:45,160
Could've sworn it was.

1904
03:04:45,160 --> 03:04:47,160
Hello everyone.

1905
03:04:47,160 --> 03:04:49,160
Hello, good job soldiers.

1906
03:04:49,160 --> 03:04:51,160
Well done.

1907
03:04:51,160 --> 03:04:53,160
Well done, soldiers.

1908
03:04:53,160 --> 03:04:55,160
Well done.

1909
03:04:55,160 --> 03:04:57,160
Resnovas with us.

1910
03:04:57,160 --> 03:04:59,160
But notice how no one interacts

1911
03:04:59,160 --> 03:05:01,160
with Resnovas.

1912
03:05:03,160 --> 03:05:05,160
A pinup.

1913
03:05:05,160 --> 03:05:07,160
Well, if you're in the need for a pinup.

1914
03:05:07,160 --> 03:05:09,160
Yes, but Azura got a pinup.

1915
03:05:09,160 --> 03:05:11,160
Mousepad design.

1916
03:05:11,160 --> 03:05:13,160
If you're in the business for a mousepad.

1917
03:05:13,160 --> 03:05:15,160
Use WASD to move and mouse to look

1918
03:05:15,160 --> 03:05:17,160
and aim.

1919
03:05:17,160 --> 03:05:19,160
Oh, it's rather

1920
03:05:19,160 --> 03:05:21,160
not insanely responsive.

1921
03:05:21,160 --> 03:05:23,160
I'll allow it.

1922
03:05:23,160 --> 03:05:25,160
We have to drive and fire.

1923
03:05:25,160 --> 03:05:27,160
Are you ready?

1924
03:05:55,160 --> 03:05:57,160
I don't know this song that well.

1925
03:05:57,160 --> 03:05:59,160
That was different.

1926
03:06:07,160 --> 03:06:09,160
I don't know this song that well.

1927
03:06:09,160 --> 03:06:11,160
That was different.

1928
03:06:15,160 --> 03:06:17,160
I'm just smiling.

1929
03:06:17,160 --> 03:06:19,160
I'm just smiling.

1930
03:06:19,160 --> 03:06:21,160
I'm smiling.

1931
03:06:21,160 --> 03:06:23,160
I'm just smiling.

1932
03:06:23,160 --> 03:06:25,160
I'm smiling.

1933
03:06:25,160 --> 03:06:27,160
Hold on, I must go back.

1934
03:06:39,160 --> 03:06:41,160
What was that?

1935
03:06:47,160 --> 03:06:49,160
Song is sympathy for the devil.

1936
03:06:49,160 --> 03:06:51,160
Oh, really?

1937
03:06:51,160 --> 03:06:53,160
Jeez.

1938
03:06:53,160 --> 03:06:55,160
I'm sorry, I just got annihilated by something.

1939
03:07:17,160 --> 03:07:19,160
That wasn't me.

1940
03:07:19,160 --> 03:07:21,160
You can't prove it.

1941
03:07:21,160 --> 03:07:23,160
That wasn't me.

1942
03:07:23,160 --> 03:07:25,160
That genuinely wasn't me.

1943
03:07:25,160 --> 03:07:27,160
I don't know why they have

1944
03:07:27,160 --> 03:07:29,160
friendly fire on.

1945
03:07:33,160 --> 03:07:35,160
That wasn't my fault.

1946
03:07:37,160 --> 03:07:39,160
They were killed in action.

1947
03:07:39,160 --> 03:07:41,160
That's technically not wrong.

1948
03:07:41,160 --> 03:07:43,160
They did get killed in action.

1949
03:07:43,160 --> 03:07:45,160
I can't.

1950
03:07:47,160 --> 03:07:49,160
Can I break the bridge?

1951
03:08:00,160 --> 03:08:02,160
I'm trying.

1952
03:08:05,160 --> 03:08:07,160
I may die on an ironic level, but can I

1953
03:08:07,160 --> 03:08:09,160
see?

1954
03:08:13,160 --> 03:08:24,920
ship on fire can someone like splash some water on the hull that would be

1955
03:08:24,920 --> 03:08:47,280
great now I'm no one want to put some water on the hull I can see thank you

1956

1959
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:29,840

1960
03:09:29,880 --> 03:09:41,480
ram I swear to God the woods was crying but he never let us see no tears nothing

1961
03:09:41,480 --> 03:09:47,360

1963
03:10:05,240 --> 03:10:13,080

1965
03:10:14,580 --> 03:10:16,580
I

1966
03:10:18,580 --> 03:10:20,580
Feel

1967
03:10:21,860 --> 03:10:23,860
Say again

1968
03:10:24,740 --> 03:10:27,860
Drift Chanko, we must be near fucking hope so

1969
03:10:31,380 --> 03:10:34,020
Whoa confirmation ground zero

1970
03:10:37,700 --> 03:10:39,700
Beep beep beep

1971
03:10:40,420 --> 03:10:45,540
Everyone let me rotate is it like oh i'm on a disneyland park right it's moving on its own now

1972
03:10:46,260 --> 03:10:50,500
They don't trust me a park. Jeez. So you trust me to drive the thing, but you don't trust me a park

1973
03:10:50,820 --> 03:10:52,820
On that disneyworld experience

1974
03:10:57,700 --> 03:11:00,260
Speaking of disneyland. Whoa, what happened?

1975
03:11:03,460 --> 03:11:08,900
What's the news i don't i don't listen to like i don't have time to even consume the news if i'm honest

1976
03:11:09,140 --> 03:11:11,140
Did something happen

1977
03:11:12,660 --> 03:11:14,660
Splash man has a lot more

1978
03:11:15,300 --> 03:11:17,300
Explosions than i remember it really

1979
03:11:18,900 --> 03:11:22,660
You can't spawn in front of me. That's the spawn render distance. That's not it

1980
03:11:23,860 --> 03:11:26,340
You're supposed to obey the rules of the spawn render

1981
03:11:26,340 --> 03:11:28,340
Now

1982
03:11:35,620 --> 03:11:39,140
The biggest women moment these are just so far i can't believe it

1983
03:11:41,460 --> 03:11:43,460
Where

1984
03:11:43,540 --> 03:11:45,540
Can you elik if you

1985
03:11:46,820 --> 03:11:51,780
I promise you if i ever make a video game that has allies they will actually shoot and kill

1986
03:11:53,060 --> 03:11:55,060
This is redonkulous

1987
03:11:56,980 --> 03:11:58,980
Not to be confused with

1988
03:12:00,420 --> 03:12:05,060
Where who's sniping in the tree? Oh

1989
03:12:06,260 --> 03:12:08,260
That's creative

1990
03:12:08,420 --> 03:12:11,300
Oh, i must have like a safety vest to keep him in the tree

1991
03:12:13,380 --> 03:12:16,100
Oh, well we're under we're under fire under fire

1992
03:12:17,780 --> 03:12:19,780
Tangles tangles to get down get down

1993
03:12:21,300 --> 03:12:23,300
Oh, that's the smart with a little lightbulb

1994
03:12:24,260 --> 03:12:30,020
To show that he's sniping from there me where what tree there's so many around us

1995
03:12:31,380 --> 03:12:35,140
If you guys can see him in the tree, why don't you shoot him instead of doing a call it up?

1996
03:12:35,220 --> 03:12:37,220
He's in the tree controversial

1997
03:12:37,220 --> 03:12:39,220
No

1998
03:12:48,580 --> 03:12:52,740
Could you imagine doing warfare and oh you hear the enemy goes

1999
03:12:54,900 --> 03:12:57,140
All your allies go down one by one

2000
03:12:59,140 --> 03:13:01,220
So they'll freaking that's my internal

2001
03:13:02,100 --> 03:13:04,100
My external dialogue

2002
03:13:04,500 --> 03:13:07,220
I like have a tannoy just to wind them up

2003
03:13:08,420 --> 03:13:12,980
Um, and i'm like allowed to speak on the tannoy. It's like a massacre

2004
03:13:14,260 --> 03:13:18,100
Hello guys, don't be afraid. It's your device. Just me

2005
03:13:22,740 --> 03:13:26,900
Very unprofessional, I feel like maybe it would take you so off course

2006
03:13:26,900 --> 03:13:32,980
Would it make you on would you make it on nerven because like I know war tactics. They play like drone sounds or like

2007
03:13:33,620 --> 03:13:34,740
um

2008
03:13:34,740 --> 03:13:36,740
Like droning music sometimes

2009
03:13:41,540 --> 03:13:46,900
A good thing i'm only 123 pounds, please don't fall off mason and your fellow

2010
03:13:48,180 --> 03:13:53,780
Please don't fall off. Where am I supposed to go? I sit down here. I'm gonna go down here

2011
03:13:53,940 --> 03:13:57,460
I'm going to go into the fuselage to find out what I need

2012
03:14:00,340 --> 03:14:03,140
What's inside the box, I guess I need the

2013
03:14:04,100 --> 03:14:06,500
Yeah, I was gonna say I think I need one of them to help me

2014
03:14:08,980 --> 03:14:13,380
Imagine if death makes for a thing in real life. There's a blast heavy metal from minor

2015
03:14:14,420 --> 03:14:16,420
Mocking the enemy always slower than

2016
03:14:16,980 --> 03:14:18,980
This guy's enjoying the killing

2017
03:14:19,380 --> 03:14:22,740
So Disney finally backed down. Oh, that's I ever call

2018
03:14:36,180 --> 03:14:38,820
Yeah, if you didn't hear the news about Disney

2019
03:14:40,180 --> 03:14:44,100
A man's waist passed the way due to severe allergy

2020
03:14:44,820 --> 03:14:46,660
at the restaurant

2021
03:14:46,740 --> 03:14:54,340
And disney cleaned that because he signed up for disney plus and because of their fishy terms and conditions that aren't realistic

2022
03:14:55,300 --> 03:14:56,260
um

2023
03:14:56,260 --> 03:14:59,940
That he's not allowed to do them for mal

2024
03:15:01,060 --> 03:15:03,060
Practice or whatever it's called

2025
03:15:03,940 --> 03:15:05,940
and

2026
03:15:07,620 --> 03:15:12,980
Because they said like hey, no allergy that's fine and then served her and she like literally perished

2027
03:15:13,940 --> 03:15:15,940
Um, but they dropped it

2028
03:15:15,940 --> 03:15:18,020
So I don't think it's going to court anymore

2029
03:15:18,020 --> 03:15:22,180
But everyone's like no it should go to court because this should set a president

2030
03:15:22,740 --> 03:15:29,380
That terms and conditions are absolutely I have a sniper that terms and conditions are just like absolute nonsense

2031
03:15:29,940 --> 03:15:31,380
and shouldn't

2032
03:15:31,380 --> 03:15:34,180
be ever like abused like that

2033
03:15:36,020 --> 03:15:37,300
Um

2034
03:15:37,300 --> 03:15:42,180
But I think because they because disney gave up and you want to know the worst part

2035
03:15:42,500 --> 03:15:44,500
You know the settlement

2036
03:15:44,500 --> 03:15:48,180
The guy wasn't even asking for much like, you know how

2037
03:15:49,060 --> 03:15:50,580
when you like

2038
03:15:50,580 --> 03:15:55,300
Get compensation for loss of life for that. It's not like he was one. I want

2039
03:15:56,020 --> 03:16:00,020
17 billion dollars. No, he literally

2040
03:16:01,300 --> 03:16:08,900
Um asked for like a super reasonable amount to continue his life without his loved one

2041
03:16:09,460 --> 03:16:13,620
I mean, of course he's going to take time off working and have loss of income and all this jazz

2042
03:16:14,260 --> 03:16:15,380
like

2043
03:16:15,380 --> 03:16:19,540
The money isn't to compensate for like the actual literal death

2044
03:16:19,620 --> 03:16:22,900
It's to compensate for the loss of quality of his life

2045
03:16:23,380 --> 03:16:26,500
and he could have obviously have um

2046
03:16:27,620 --> 03:16:30,340
Asked for a lot more and he was like no, I just

2047
03:16:30,980 --> 03:16:35,460
This is apparently how much I need to live and that's what I'm going to ask for

2048
03:16:36,260 --> 03:16:42,820
Um, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, put it down mason mason. You're not a boy

2049
03:16:43,620 --> 03:16:46,180
Oh, wait. No, these are the baddies. I take it back mason shoot

2050
03:16:48,580 --> 03:16:50,580
They found

2051
03:16:51,300 --> 03:16:54,980
We must make up for lost time. No, no, no, no, no ow

2052
03:16:56,820 --> 03:16:58,820
Naughty

2053
03:16:59,620 --> 03:17:01,620
You never get off the boat

2054
03:17:02,580 --> 03:17:04,580
Off the boat get off the boat baby

2055
03:17:06,740 --> 03:17:10,580
What does disney plus have to do with a restaurant basically they had like a

2056
03:17:11,220 --> 03:17:14,260
clause thing and signing up for disney plus

2057
03:17:15,060 --> 03:17:17,060
that or

2058
03:17:17,780 --> 03:17:21,620
A you can't sue us or something and everyone was like, huh?

2059
03:17:21,860 --> 03:17:25,860
And once it made the news obviously disney got bad press for it

2060
03:17:25,860 --> 03:17:30,260
So they dropped it but it was only because it made the news if it didn't make the news

2061
03:17:31,060 --> 03:17:33,220
Uh, it wouldn't have been dropped

2062
03:17:34,500 --> 03:17:37,140
They would have taken it to court, which is absolutely discussed

2063
03:17:38,820 --> 03:17:41,300
I want mommy's film me just like that. Hear me. I want to pass it

2064
03:17:42,900 --> 03:17:47,620
Oh, I'm not ordered the artwork yet for oh, I'm silly. Oh my god

2065
03:17:48,340 --> 03:17:54,980
I can I can contact the artist to make that scene from uh, the honey happy sugar life

2066
03:17:56,340 --> 03:17:59,700
And then I'm going to do a little dodging strip and I'm going to be black

2067
03:18:04,660 --> 03:18:09,300
I'm very happy finding that artist. I got very lucky finding her. She's a dream to work with

2068
03:18:10,180 --> 03:18:11,380
um

2069
03:18:11,380 --> 03:18:13,380
She did a zurra's mouse pad

2070

exchange goods and services for money with each other

2078
03:18:41,460 --> 03:18:43,460

2081
03:18:49,620 --> 03:18:51,780
I remember this mission. It's like birds. I be an embodiment

2082
03:18:52,500 --> 03:18:54,500
mommy blacks million due into

2083
03:18:55,300 --> 03:18:59,460
Whipping it out for her to see how you self carry some more

2084
03:19:02,500 --> 03:19:05,000
I'll write that I'll write that

2085
03:19:08,660 --> 03:19:15,780
Um, who's idea was it to give us or a toggle to take our horns and ears off because it was genius. Um

2086
03:19:19,220 --> 03:19:21,140
Uh

2087
03:19:21,140 --> 03:19:28,660
She did it. You can take the vtuber model and like hide stuff. Like, you know how I did the 10k subscriber milestone stream

2088
03:19:29,540 --> 03:19:32,500
I had to take my toggle clothes off for that. Like

2089
03:19:33,140 --> 03:19:36,980
Uh, you can go into the layers in vtuber studio and hide and remove stuff

2090
03:19:37,700 --> 03:19:43,140
That's how she was able to do that human version because she went into our model and like hide them and made it a toggle

2091
03:19:43,140 --> 03:19:46,340
We're getting indicated to find kilo one. I'm attacking. Yeah, like when we get it all. Yeah

2092
03:19:46,500 --> 03:19:51,140
So it wasn't like a toggle that like was purchased or anything. Oh my god. I'm so sorry. Right. I need to focus up

2093
03:19:51,860 --> 03:19:53,860

2095
03:20:05,860 --> 03:20:08,660
Okay, kilo you need to move east

2096
03:20:09,220 --> 03:20:11,220
Press space

2097
03:20:13,940 --> 03:20:15,940
Okay, I press space

2098
03:20:18,340 --> 03:20:20,340
Okay, they're moving

2099
03:20:23,220 --> 03:20:24,340
Get into the

2100
03:20:28,740 --> 03:20:30,740
Yes, yes, yes

2101
03:20:31,300 --> 03:20:36,260
Okay, safe house. Good. Good. Good. No tangles inside. You guys just see passing by the house

2102
03:20:37,220 --> 03:20:40,740
Wait, no enemy has stopped in front of the house. Oh

2103
03:20:41,860 --> 03:20:46,180
I'm oh, this is okay. This is such a cool mission. This may be one of the best missions. I don't know

2104
03:20:47,540 --> 03:20:51,060
I don't know call me bias. This is a pretty cool mission

2105
03:20:53,860 --> 03:20:55,860
Would it be my favorite?

2106
03:20:55,860 --> 03:20:57,860
Oh

2107
03:21:11,460 --> 03:21:13,460
This things are diabolical

2108
03:21:18,180 --> 03:21:20,180
Okay, I think we're okay

2109
03:21:20,740 --> 03:21:22,740
Kilo you are clear

2110
03:21:25,700 --> 03:21:28,340
Okay, the road is hot exit through the rear of the building

2111
03:21:29,380 --> 03:21:31,380
Go

2112
03:21:35,620 --> 03:21:40,020
Okay, so first exit through the building and then beat him up

2113
03:21:40,980 --> 03:21:42,980
Two target sighted kill him

2114
03:21:43,220 --> 03:21:45,220
Oh

2115
03:21:46,740 --> 03:21:50,820
Good nice work kilo one now you can make it over here safely

2116
03:21:53,380 --> 03:21:58,500
Flashbangs really do be flushed. I can't believe the sole purpose of a flashbang is the flash and it's working

2117
03:21:58,500 --> 03:22:00,500
The objective is inside

2118
03:22:09,140 --> 03:22:11,140
Kilo stop and drop

2119
03:22:11,860 --> 03:22:13,860
Confirm kilo one you're out of sight

2120
03:22:17,300 --> 03:22:19,300
Oof

2121
03:22:19,860 --> 03:22:21,860
I think you're gonna discover that building

2122
03:22:22,660 --> 03:22:27,860
We're gonna discover something wrong with that building you guys don't need to get a move on

2123
03:22:29,460 --> 03:22:31,460
All clear kilo one

2124
03:22:32,820 --> 03:22:39,220
Okay, attack the barracks multiple targets inside reaching clear kilo one. Oh, they're gonna know

2125
03:22:40,340 --> 03:22:42,340
They're gonna know

2126
03:22:44,260 --> 03:22:46,740
A story of the calls what is thy wisdom?

2127
03:22:47,060 --> 03:22:52,420
Famous that's my wisdom. Famous is the best gun in black ops one

2128
03:22:53,700 --> 03:22:55,700
The recoil is really fair

2129
03:22:56,500 --> 03:23:01,940
And the hip fire is really fair and it's such a good gun. That's my wisdom to do

2130
03:23:04,820 --> 03:23:10,180
It's the best gun ever and if you have joe mac the reload time is really good

2131
03:23:11,300 --> 03:23:14,580
That's my words of wisdom and I will not argue otherwise

2132
03:23:15,060 --> 03:23:19,140
Everyone must agree that this is the best gun in this game

2133
03:23:23,860 --> 03:23:26,500
Famous I see such good wisdom. Thank you. Thank you

2134
03:23:28,420 --> 03:23:33,460
Kilo move north move north. Okay space bar

2135
03:23:38,500 --> 03:23:40,500
Space bar

2136
03:23:41,220 --> 03:23:43,220
On our way over

2137
03:23:43,300 --> 03:23:45,300
Kilo one we have infantry inbound

2138
03:23:45,300 --> 03:23:48,660
Accountably six targets too hot stop and drop stay out of sight

2139
03:23:48,740 --> 03:23:52,580
They really made me do a cutscene for that gave the squad to the Soviet oposite again

2140
03:23:54,420 --> 03:23:56,420
Huh

2141
03:23:57,700 --> 03:23:59,700
No, my game did you crash?

2142
03:24:02,980 --> 03:24:04,980
Hmm

2143
03:24:04,980 --> 03:24:06,980
I act as like it crashed there

2144
03:24:07,940 --> 03:24:11,700
He was still talking to me in the cutscene and I never cooked anything

2145
03:24:12,500 --> 03:24:13,620
What about the galeo?

2146
03:24:13,620 --> 03:24:19,940
I'll give you the galeo galeo surprise was actually really good as well for the extra ammunition at 35 in the chamber in the mag

2147
03:24:22,740 --> 03:24:26,900
Everyone went and their mother used the famine it just was a well-rounded gun

2148
03:24:28,180 --> 03:24:30,180
I'm so juicy

2149
03:24:31,140 --> 03:24:33,140
Well, this is rather terrifying

2150
03:24:36,980 --> 03:24:38,980
I ain't touching the thing

2151
03:24:47,300 --> 03:24:50,900
We are quite the teamer for that freaking invisible, honestly

2152
03:24:51,700 --> 03:24:53,700
I

2153
03:25:05,300 --> 03:25:11,220
Almost messed up because I was going to run to the door like hi. I could completely be spawns

2154
03:25:13,540 --> 03:25:17,060
Sneaky time the galeo or is that called the galeo?

2155
03:25:17,620 --> 03:25:20,580
Big guy this is galeo one. We still have some tech. I live in

2156
03:25:21,220 --> 03:25:25,460
Famous visibility has improved. We're starting out in search of moving to the substation

2157
03:25:27,460 --> 03:25:31,780
Big eyes for combat centering the structure over. Roger that big guy. We're going in

2158
03:25:33,140 --> 03:25:37,300
I hate this mission because of the dogs. Yeah, unfortunately, but a dog. Go to the but

2159
03:25:38,500 --> 03:25:40,340
Ready

2160

2162
03:25:45,860 --> 03:25:47,860

2170
03:26:06,020 --> 03:26:09,460
I think I promise I clicked it. I promise I did

2171
03:26:13,220 --> 03:26:16,420
Let's go. Oh, you need to hold it. Oh

2172
03:26:19,780 --> 03:26:23,460
I didn't realize how dangerous uh descending was

2173
03:26:34,740 --> 03:26:36,740
Okay, there we go. Oh, we did it

2174
03:26:37,700 --> 03:26:41,620
Okay, I'm dumb. Okay. Oh, no, we need another sequence again. Oh no

2175
03:26:43,220 --> 03:26:47,940
Dead's 18. There's no way I've died 18 times. You would think I've never played this game before

2176
03:26:48,980 --> 03:26:50,980
Ready when you are

2177
03:26:51,140 --> 03:26:53,140
He's right mouse

2178
03:26:53,220 --> 03:26:55,220
Wrong one. I was left or right, honestly

2179
03:27:01,540 --> 03:27:03,540
I can't see

2180
03:27:04,500 --> 03:27:06,500
Uh

2181
03:27:09,460 --> 03:27:14,260
Oh, sorry. Oh, sorry weaver my bad and my defense you're in front of my bullet

2182
03:27:18,580 --> 03:27:23,460
As much as I want to find this it's not silent. Where does this make sense for the stealth mission?

2183
03:27:23,620 --> 03:27:27,060
so I'ma be it and behave and

2184
03:27:28,980 --> 03:27:31,460
I'ma behave and listen to the game

2185
03:27:32,180 --> 03:27:38,980
The r word stands for repel exactly the one over six thunder gun section was a lot. No

2186
03:27:41,780 --> 03:27:47,940
No, wait, I got it first time. I knew exactly I already knew about that Easter egg and I did not learn about it today

2187
03:27:49,620 --> 03:27:55,380
Why is Hudson getting cool emissions than mason? I think mason's like wrap up and look at the end though

2188
03:27:55,380 --> 03:28:01,860
Okay, gently tip-tap tip-tap tip-tap tip-tap. We're tipping tapping down the hill

2189
03:28:02,340 --> 03:28:05,460
With the tip-tap in case the game's gonna tell us to drop and roll one a minute

2190
03:28:06,260 --> 03:28:10,180
Wow, I'm ready. I'm ready. Come on. Come on. Bring it to me

2191
03:28:16,180 --> 03:28:18,180
Kilo one approaching the objective

2192
03:28:18,820 --> 03:28:20,820
That big guy we're going in

2193
03:28:20,900 --> 03:28:27,860
Okay, after this one we get a drink and stretch and get some food seeds

2194
03:28:45,860 --> 03:28:47,860
Can you do this killing them both?

2195
03:28:51,380 --> 03:28:53,380
Oh

2196
03:28:58,900 --> 03:29:08,340
Okay, they're actually helping me a Christmas miracle. Oh, I did it correct

2197
03:29:12,900 --> 03:29:14,900
Why would I

2198
03:29:15,780 --> 03:29:17,780
Oh

2199
03:29:17,940 --> 03:29:20,180
Well, I tried I thought I did really well

2200
03:29:20,500 --> 03:29:25,060
Didn't quite because they were helping me kill like the other person that came with them, you know

2201
03:29:25,860 --> 03:29:27,860
Ow

2202
03:29:31,940 --> 03:29:33,940
I think I have to walk through to this part

2203
03:29:36,340 --> 03:29:38,340
There's a door here, but

2204
03:29:39,300 --> 03:29:41,300
Oh

2205
03:29:43,140 --> 03:29:45,140
Maybe

2206
03:29:48,900 --> 03:29:53,540
This no candy beef. Oh is I was like

2207
03:29:58,020 --> 03:30:04,180
Damage drop off maybe go loud. Oh shit. Sorry. Sorry. I'm talking to the reef lens. Okay, geez

2208
03:30:08,580 --> 03:30:10,580
I can't move over the

2209
03:30:11,060 --> 03:30:15,940
In coded when they have coded things like this you can't go around them. They're like blocking the air

2210
03:30:18,260 --> 03:30:20,260
Let me in

2211
03:30:21,620 --> 03:30:23,620
Uh, who am I shooting not the scientists?

2212
03:30:26,020 --> 03:30:28,020
There was one over there

2213
03:30:34,500 --> 03:30:36,500
Sorry, I shouldn't have fired

2214
03:30:37,140 --> 03:30:42,900
Don't kill the scientists. They're just trying to forget pretty sick. Yeah, they're doing diabolical things against humanity

2215
03:30:43,780 --> 03:30:46,500
Or manufacturing the diabolical things, but

2216
03:30:48,740 --> 03:30:53,780
I don't know. Maybe maybe we should look into some scientists. I wouldn't be down for that. I would be

2217
03:30:55,460 --> 03:30:57,460
Sorry, I'm getting a blurt rate. Hold on

2218
03:30:58,500 --> 03:31:03,460
I'm getting a blurt rate. Hold on. Let me be a fish. I'm just a busy. I'm just a busy on the floor

2219
03:31:06,660 --> 03:31:08,660
Oh

2220
03:31:12,740 --> 03:31:16,660
Oh, what how are they coming in we came from there

2221
03:31:18,340 --> 03:31:20,340
We literally came from above

2222
03:31:20,580 --> 03:31:22,180
Move weaver

2223
03:31:22,180 --> 03:31:29,940
Please sorry. I lost my temperature. I apologize. Please may we progress to the next mission objective?

03:31:30,020 --> 03:31:34,500
So I can make a cup of tea. Thank you. I would like to make a cup of tea

2225
03:31:35,460 --> 03:31:40,660
And I would like I certainly was gonna disable are you joking? You should rip it out the whole thing

2226
03:31:45,540 --> 03:31:50,660
It's gonna take them so long to replace those wires. I'm sure they don't have replacements at all

2227
03:31:52,500 --> 03:31:54,500
Where

2228
03:31:57,620 --> 03:32:02,980

Pick me pick me

2231
03:32:11,380 --> 03:32:13,380
I can't see anything

2232
03:32:13,540 --> 03:32:19,940
Although I need to lock in gamers. I cannot see I am slipping and I think I'm about to slide off the edge of the avalanche

2233
03:32:22,100 --> 03:32:24,100

We're clear

2237
03:32:35,940 --> 03:32:37,940
I'm not being teased

2238
03:32:37,940 --> 03:32:39,940
Was that to jump off of that?

2239
03:32:41,060 --> 03:32:43,060
Don't say 19. Damn it

2240
03:32:44,180 --> 03:32:46,740

I'm running I'm running I'm running I'm running

2246
03:33:09,380 --> 03:33:11,380
I'm jumping off the uh

2247
03:33:11,380 --> 03:33:16,660
If you if your comrades would jump off a cliff would you yeah, yeah, I would I'm gonna do it right now

2248
03:33:16,660 --> 03:33:18,660
You ready ready to see this in 4k?

2249
03:33:19,300 --> 03:33:21,300
No, are you ready to see this in 1080p?

2250
03:33:22,740 --> 03:33:25,460
Okay, three two one

2251
03:33:29,300 --> 03:33:31,300
I'm getting frostbite

2252
03:33:31,300 --> 03:33:37,220
Do you want to maybe go forward a bit so we don't hit the cliff edge press F

2253
03:33:41,940 --> 03:33:51,620
We're in an enemy calm. Ow my ankles. That was a very fast descent. Okay. Is that the cliff I jumped on? Maybe

2254
03:33:52,020 --> 03:34:03,780
Are we quiet yet or is it quiet time or

2255
03:34:06,020 --> 03:34:11,860
I mean they look pretty ready for a fight. I'm gonna be honest. Yeah, I think I don't think it needs to be quiet here

2256
03:34:14,420 --> 03:34:21,220
I guess they probably would have heard the explosions on top of the hill, you know, maybe maybe the loud explosion

2257
03:34:21,460 --> 03:34:26,100
Yeah, I might have tipped them off that there's something going on in the compound. That isn't quite right. Hmm

2258
03:34:26,980 --> 03:34:31,460
Our radio. Yeah radio was pretty big back then so communication

2259
03:34:32,820 --> 03:34:35,140
Yeah, now that now they're taking to consideration

2260
03:34:38,260 --> 03:34:43,940
Yes, that was rather rather small brained of me don't mind me though. I love the small

2337
03:41:11,700 --> 03:41:18,900
Oh, hold on a minute. I can't believe it when you go to Vietnam. There's Vietnamese people. It's shocking

2338
03:41:21,780 --> 03:41:23,780

Okay, sorry

03:41:41,700 --> 03:41:45,620
Got machete. I like how you paused to let me kill him. That was really a polite of you

2343
03:41:46,500 --> 03:41:51,460
Let's bless you what happened. I'm like really tickly sneezes that make me go like

2344
03:41:52,100 --> 03:41:54,580
But then sometimes I scare it away when I do that

2345
03:41:55,460 --> 03:41:59,620
So I still got the relief of sneezing. Shoot him. Fuck you, bitch

2346
03:41:59,620 --> 03:42:01,620
You got him

2347
03:42:04,260 --> 03:42:06,260
Let's go when you got time to waste

2348
03:42:09,300 --> 03:42:15,700
I wasn't supposed to that just startled me. Did I scare you? I'm coming again

2349
03:42:15,700 --> 03:42:18,500

03:43:42,900 --> 03:43:46,340
Oh, wait, he's doing it. Oh, like I think he's doing it. I think I think we're safe

03:44:48,420 --> 03:44:50,420
Okay, there we go

Give me my

2375
03:45:00,020 --> 03:45:05,140
Wait for the reload it's taking forever and I've had terrible aim

2376
03:45:08,260 --> 03:45:13,860
I'm getting shredded out here. You need to this machine needs to reload. Oh my god. I'm gonna like crash into our rock

2377
03:45:15,140 --> 03:45:20,420
I'm not even gonna die because of the enemy. It's literally my driving like why are we like tilted

2378
03:45:20,980 --> 03:45:22,980
Like why are we tilting?

2379
03:45:27,060 --> 03:45:31,220
I don't know even though this is gonna like I think I'm spraying

2380
03:45:34,740 --> 03:45:36,740
I'm spraying

2381
03:45:36,740 --> 03:45:38,740
Good job

2382
03:45:45,300 --> 03:45:52,420
Is that enough bridge destruction? Yeah. Yeah, that's right. That's why it's a big convoy. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not sure I get right

2383
03:45:54,660 --> 03:45:59,380
Mommy I'm gonna be sick. Oh, no, I never even thought about the motion sickness. I'm so sorry. Please close your eyes, Brooklyn

2384
03:46:00,660 --> 03:46:02,660
I'm gonna make you so sick

2385
03:46:03,140 --> 03:46:05,140
Is that it?

2386
03:46:05,460 --> 03:46:09,460
Can I go higher up? I don't know. I feel like it'd be a bit safer mason to go a bit higher

2387
03:46:09,540 --> 03:46:11,460
I don't know. What do you think?

2388
03:46:11,460 --> 03:46:13,460
What do you think son?

2389
03:46:13,780 --> 03:46:16,580
Do you think we should be higher up in the fucking stratosphere?

2390
03:46:17,060 --> 03:46:22,420
Instead of two feet off the ground, I can harvest the freaking race crops from here. They're right below me

2391
03:46:23,060 --> 03:46:26,740
Go up. Why are we so scared of going a bit higher?

2392
03:46:30,260 --> 03:46:32,260
Come on

2393
03:46:33,620 --> 03:46:35,620
Um

2394
03:46:37,620 --> 03:46:44,820
I see um, but you need to reload a bit faster. I don't know. I'm spraying but nothing's happening. Okay, that one exploded

2395
03:46:50,420 --> 03:46:56,660
I just can't eat thank you. Jeez right and we're destroying the homes as well. Sorry, but

2396
03:46:57,220 --> 03:46:59,220
I

2397
03:46:59,780 --> 03:47:01,780
Must be another bridge

2398
03:47:04,820 --> 03:47:09,220
That's what I think about your infrastructure as well. Yep destroy the infrastructure

2399
03:47:13,380 --> 03:47:16,580
Wait, why did I hear random rushing in the background? Is that supposed to be?

2400
03:47:16,580 --> 03:47:18,580
Or

2401
03:47:25,140 --> 03:47:30,580
Is the way oh, is it from Russian military or something like all the assets?

2402
03:47:36,100 --> 03:47:43,700
I think I've just backed up on the hill. Uh, I'm on fire not to be dramatic or anything, but I am on fire

2403
03:47:44,660 --> 03:47:46,660
It's no letting it

2404
03:47:48,420 --> 03:47:52,420
Oh, thank goodness. I finished that sequence you took their chopper

2405
03:47:59,060 --> 03:48:06,420

Are you okay?

2455
03:52:38,420 --> 03:52:44,740
No, I don't think so. I don't think Mason's doing so good

2456
03:52:51,860 --> 03:52:53,860
Look at the symbolism on that picture

2457
03:53:01,460 --> 03:53:04,100

03:53:27,860 --> 03:53:29,860
Resmond is in there

You went to rebirth island and death's orders. Why Mason?

2463
03:53:40,820 --> 03:53:48,020
Steiner was there. We had to kill Steiner and Wilson and the CIA. We're already on their way to get Steiner and Revers

2464
03:53:48,500 --> 03:53:54,100
Why did you have to go to Agovitch Kravchenko Steiner? They all had to die

Oh

2469
03:54:52,900 --> 03:54:56,020
I like the idea that they're interrogating me and then they keep passing out and I go

2470
03:55:01,460 --> 03:55:04,580
And they're like, oh, we need the numbers. What are you doing?

03:55:51,400 --> 03:55:53,400
There's nothing here

2478
03:56:13,640 --> 03:56:15,640

Oh my god, have I done it for the first time without messing up?

2496
03:58:00,280 --> 03:58:04,040
Peepies peeping mummies and shivers down a spine

2540
04:02:27,640 --> 04:02:29,640
Rrraah!

2541
04:02:29,640 --> 04:02:31,640
Brrraah!

2542
04:02:34,640 --> 04:02:36,640
Hi, Strony and Chat, I'm here!

2543
04:02:41,640 --> 04:02:45,640
20 minutes earlier on the south side.

2544
04:02:46,640 --> 04:02:48,640
Strony Wick.

2545
04:02:49,640 --> 04:02:51,640
Wait, Miss Strony, when did you get a gun?

2546
04:02:51,640 --> 04:02:52,640
I always had one.

2547
04:02:52,640 --> 04:02:54,640
I see straps, like CD.

2548
04:02:54,640 --> 04:02:56,640
In that one short.

2549
04:02:57,640 --> 04:02:59,640
Inking squad, we're moving!

2550
04:02:59,640 --> 04:03:01,640
Top squad, let's roll!

2551
04:03:01,640 --> 04:03:03,640
Copy that, we're on the move!

2552
04:03:14,640 --> 04:03:17,640
Okay, so while Mason's sneaking around,

2553
04:03:17,640 --> 04:03:20,640
we are in massive ass tanks,

2554
04:03:20,640 --> 04:03:24,640
alert in the whole neighborhood to our tank clap.

2555
04:03:27,640 --> 04:03:30,640
I like the contrast, I like the contrast of like,

2556
04:03:30,640 --> 04:03:32,640
still, still, still.

2557
04:03:32,640 --> 04:03:34,640
And then these two are like, Rrraah!

2558
04:03:34,640 --> 04:03:37,640
Big tank, big tank.

2559
04:03:43,640 --> 04:03:46,640
Big tanku desu.

2560
04:03:46,640 --> 04:03:48,640
Oh, they got the water power.

2561
04:03:48,640 --> 04:03:51,640
That's like an Olympic thing, like you're late on fire.

2562
04:03:51,640 --> 04:03:53,640
Oh, that's the enemy.

2563
04:03:53,640 --> 04:03:56,640
Sorry, I thought I maybe had bombs or something,

2564
04:03:56,640 --> 04:03:58,640
but I was like, nope, just zooming in and out.

2565
04:03:58,640 --> 04:04:01,640
Just casually zooming in and out, sorry.

2566
04:04:02,640 --> 04:04:03,640
Where are we going?

2567
04:04:03,640 --> 04:04:04,640
We're going a little to the right.

2568
04:04:04,640 --> 04:04:06,640
Okay, I'll take the right.

2569
04:04:09,640 --> 04:04:11,640
This tank has a lot of overheat though.

2570
04:04:11,640 --> 04:04:14,640
It's happening very quickly.

2571
04:04:15,640 --> 04:04:18,640
How does the car blown up next to you not kill you?

2572
04:04:18,640 --> 04:04:21,640
But when a car blows up like eight feet away from me,

2573
04:04:21,640 --> 04:04:23,640
eight feet, no, eight miles away from me,

2574
04:04:23,640 --> 04:04:25,640
the game's like, nice try.

2575
04:04:25,640 --> 04:04:27,640
You want to go in your try again?

2576
04:04:27,640 --> 04:04:28,640
Nerd.

2577
04:04:28,640 --> 04:04:29,640
My tank is on fire.

2578
04:04:29,640 --> 04:04:31,640
I'm just going to pretend it's shrapnel

2579
04:04:31,640 --> 04:04:33,640
that's on fire at the front of the tank,

2580
04:04:33,640 --> 04:04:35,640
but I think I may actually lose

2581
04:04:35,640 --> 04:04:37,640
and my gun is overheating.

2582
04:04:39,640 --> 04:04:43,640
The panther definitely is overheating.

2583
04:04:44,640 --> 04:04:45,640
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

2584
04:04:45,640 --> 04:04:47,640
It's not on fire, it's overheating.

2585
04:04:47,640 --> 04:04:48,640
Yeah, there's a difference.

2586
04:04:48,640 --> 04:04:50,640
Yeah, yeah, there's a difference.

2587
04:04:52,640 --> 04:04:53,640
What, this?

2588
04:04:59,640 --> 04:05:00,640
Oh, did that die?

2589
04:05:00,640 --> 04:05:01,640
No, that was scripted.

2590
04:05:01,640 --> 04:05:02,640
Okay, good.

2591
04:05:07,640 --> 04:05:08,640
They're in novices.

2592
04:05:08,640 --> 04:05:10,640
Oh, we're in novices.

2593
04:05:12,640 --> 04:05:13,640
Oh, no.

2594
04:05:18,640 --> 04:05:19,640
He didn't make it.

2595
04:05:19,640 --> 04:05:20,640
He had like a crack.

2596
04:05:23,640 --> 04:05:24,640
Oh!

2597
04:05:27,640 --> 04:05:29,640
Okay, right.

2598
04:05:29,640 --> 04:05:31,640
This, curious, interesting.

2599
04:05:32,640 --> 04:05:34,640
Oh my God, it's like, oh,

2600
04:05:34,640 --> 04:05:37,640
they're literally cannot see through the thickness.

2601
04:05:39,640 --> 04:05:41,640
I can, like, hardly see a thing.

2602
04:05:41,640 --> 04:05:42,640
I can see a thing.

2603
04:05:46,640 --> 04:05:49,640
I don't ever remember using this site in multiplayer.

2604
04:05:51,640 --> 04:05:52,640
I feel like it's too awkward,

2605
04:05:52,640 --> 04:05:55,640
like, just open your eyes to see the enemy.

2606
04:06:00,640 --> 04:06:01,640
I said something,

2607
04:06:01,640 --> 04:06:03,640
I shouldn't have made fun over there, but...

2608
04:06:07,640 --> 04:06:08,640
Any intel?

2609
04:06:08,640 --> 04:06:09,640
No intel.

2610
04:06:10,640 --> 04:06:12,640
I feel like whenever they design something

2611
04:06:12,640 --> 04:06:14,640
that you can kind of, like, do a U-turn on,

2612
04:06:14,640 --> 04:06:16,640
that's where they're secretly putting the intel.

2613
04:06:18,640 --> 04:06:20,640
Right, I guess my suit doesn't heal

2614
04:06:20,640 --> 04:06:22,640
and it'll crack until I'm dead,

2615
04:06:22,640 --> 04:06:26,640
so I'm, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah, that, that!

2616
04:06:28,640 --> 04:06:29,640
That's what I don't want,

2617
04:06:29,640 --> 04:06:31,640
so I'm gonna try and play a bit safer than usual.

2618
04:06:37,640 --> 04:06:38,640
Uh-huh.

2619
04:06:40,640 --> 04:06:41,640
That was...

2620
04:06:42,640 --> 04:06:44,640
What are you, a civilian?

2621
04:06:47,640 --> 04:06:49,640
Oh my gosh, I'm trying to play careful,

2622
04:06:49,640 --> 04:06:51,640
but somehow I'm actually playing worse

2623
04:06:52,640 --> 04:06:54,640
to try to be careful

2624
04:06:55,640 --> 04:06:58,640
than I am if I was just guns-ablezin'.

2625
04:07:01,640 --> 04:07:03,640
Okay, I need to out of this section,

2626
04:07:03,640 --> 04:07:05,640
like, ace up, how about that?

2627
04:07:06,640 --> 04:07:08,640
Can we go upstairs in the fire?

2628
04:07:10,640 --> 04:07:12,640
As if I wouldn't melt the suit.

2629
04:07:12,640 --> 04:07:14,640
The suit's not, like, invincible.

2630
04:07:15,640 --> 04:07:18,640
As much as I have a temperature to, you know...

2631
04:07:19,640 --> 04:07:21,640
Okay, can I make it across?

2632
04:07:22,640 --> 04:07:24,640
Let me, at least.

2633
04:07:24,640 --> 04:07:26,640
I'm trying to be...

2634
04:07:27,640 --> 04:07:30,640
I'm so dainty, I'm such a skinny soldier.

2635
04:07:31,640 --> 04:07:33,640
I'm so skinny that you can't shoot me

2636
04:07:33,640 --> 04:07:35,640
and you don't know where I am.

2637
04:07:36,640 --> 04:07:38,640
I blend in with the walls.

2638
04:07:42,640 --> 04:07:43,640
Okay.

2639
04:07:43,640 --> 04:07:44,640
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

2640
04:07:44,640 --> 04:07:46,640
There's a frickin' Huey!

2641
04:07:46,640 --> 04:07:48,640
How am I supposed to go against the Huey?

2642
04:07:51,640 --> 04:07:52,640
Where is it?

2643
04:07:52,640 --> 04:07:53,640
Oh, there is.

2644
04:07:53,640 --> 04:07:54,640
Hold on.

2645
04:07:54,640 --> 04:07:55,640
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

2646
04:07:55,640 --> 04:07:56,640
Gimme.

2647
04:08:00,640 --> 04:08:01,640
That...

2648
04:08:03,640 --> 04:08:05,640
One more? That wasn't it?

2649
04:08:05,640 --> 04:08:07,640
Hold on, let me refire inside this house.

2650
04:08:07,640 --> 04:08:08,640
Are you joking?

2651
04:08:08,640 --> 04:08:10,640
I think I'm about to perish.

2652
04:08:11,640 --> 04:08:12,640
Okay.

2653
04:08:14,640 --> 04:08:16,640
I don't, I'm getting nervous.

2654
04:08:16,640 --> 04:08:18,640
I'm getting nervous.

2655
04:08:20,640 --> 04:08:22,640
I've lost my little gun as well.

2656
04:08:22,640 --> 04:08:23,640
Drap.

2657
04:08:23,640 --> 04:08:25,640
Hopefully it's a bit clearer.

2658
04:08:28,640 --> 04:08:30,640
This thing's about to crack.

2659
04:08:30,640 --> 04:08:33,640
It looks like cobble wobbles on my screen.

2660
04:08:35,640 --> 04:08:36,640
Okay.

2661
04:08:36,640 --> 04:08:38,640
I'm allowed a regular gun now, so...

2662
04:08:39,640 --> 04:08:41,640
Make it through Novo without dying.

2663
04:08:41,640 --> 04:08:43,640
I've got a mini achievement for that.

2664
04:08:43,640 --> 04:08:44,640
Thank you.

2665
04:08:44,640 --> 04:08:46,640
I feel so accomplished.

2666
04:08:46,640 --> 04:08:47,640
I'm so...

2667
04:08:47,640 --> 04:08:48,640
Ow!

2668
04:08:48,640 --> 04:08:51,640
So, we're not doing this RPG shit already.

2669
04:08:51,640 --> 04:08:52,640
Leave me alone.

2670
04:08:53,640 --> 04:08:55,640
My biggest enemy, RPG.

2671
04:08:55,640 --> 04:08:56,640
Oh, that's an enemy?

2672
04:08:56,640 --> 04:08:59,640
His gun was so low down, I thought he was the head.

2673
04:09:01,640 --> 04:09:03,640
No, don't throw nades at me.

2674
04:09:04,640 --> 04:09:06,640
Only ammo to do it.

2675
04:09:07,640 --> 04:09:08,640
But we're getting there.

2676
04:09:08,640 --> 04:09:10,640
I actually think we're about to finish.

2677
04:09:10,640 --> 04:09:13,640
I was gonna go get like tea and water and food and that,

2678
04:09:13,640 --> 04:09:15,640
but I'm like, honestly...

2679
04:09:15,640 --> 04:09:16,640
I...

2680
04:09:16,640 --> 04:09:17,640
My...

2681
04:09:17,640 --> 04:09:20,640
If we're about to kill the second guy...

2682
04:09:20,640 --> 04:09:24,640
Doesn't that mean we're literally around the corner from finishing

2683
04:09:24,640 --> 04:09:27,640
and cracking the case with Mason's numbers?

2684
04:09:28,640 --> 04:09:29,640
Um...

2685
04:09:30,640 --> 04:09:32,640
Because, yeah...

2686
04:09:34,640 --> 04:09:36,640
We can have a little yap after.

2687
04:09:38,640 --> 04:09:39,640
Hold on.

2688
04:09:40,640 --> 04:09:41,640
Oh, do not blow this car up.

2689
04:09:41,640 --> 04:09:43,640
Don't make myself clear.

2690
04:09:43,640 --> 04:09:44,640
Don't be selfish.

2691
04:09:46,640 --> 04:09:47,640
Um...

2692
04:09:48,640 --> 04:09:50,640
I think you should get some water.

2693
04:09:50,640 --> 04:09:53,640
I'm gonna see if I have the energy to make my...

2694
04:09:54,640 --> 04:09:56,640
I'm gonna focus on my...

2695
04:09:56,640 --> 04:09:58,640
Patreon audio.

2696
04:09:58,640 --> 04:10:00,640
I don't know...

2697
04:10:00,640 --> 04:10:04,640
If I should try and stay up and get big boy sleep,

2698
04:10:04,640 --> 04:10:05,640
or...

2699
04:10:06,640 --> 04:10:07,640
If I should...

2700
04:10:07,640 --> 04:10:09,640
Sorry, I have a really itchy thumb.

2701
04:10:09,640 --> 04:10:11,640
Gimli clawed me earlier.

2702
04:10:11,640 --> 04:10:13,640
I swear if I got infected, I'm right down.

2703
04:10:13,640 --> 04:10:14,640
Oh!

2704
04:10:14,640 --> 04:10:17,640
Oh, did that nade feel nice, yeah?

2705
04:10:17,640 --> 04:10:19,640
He just ate that fucking nade.

2706
04:10:20,640 --> 04:10:21,640
And I did get me wrong.

2707
04:10:21,640 --> 04:10:23,640
I love a good architect moment, but eating a nade,

2708
04:10:23,640 --> 04:10:25,640
that's where I draw the line.

2709
04:10:25,640 --> 04:10:27,640
Yeah, you're crossing stuff.

2710
04:10:27,640 --> 04:10:28,640
That shouldn't be happening.

2711
04:10:28,640 --> 04:10:30,640
Oh, let's hack into the mainframe.

2712
04:10:30,640 --> 04:10:31,640
People, people, people.

2713
04:10:36,640 --> 04:10:38,640
Wiggly, wiggly water.

2714
04:10:39,640 --> 04:10:40,640
Get rested.

2715
04:10:40,640 --> 04:10:42,640
What, and then...

2716
04:10:42,640 --> 04:10:44,640
Get rested, get rested, get rested.

2717
04:10:44,640 --> 04:10:45,640
Nap, nap, nap, nap, nap.

2718
04:10:45,640 --> 04:10:46,640
True.

2719
04:10:46,640 --> 04:10:47,640
Here.

2720
04:10:52,640 --> 04:10:55,640
Okay, we're decontaminated.

2721
04:10:55,640 --> 04:10:59,640
Oh, we're trying to talk to Mason from this POV.

2722
04:11:00,640 --> 04:11:02,640
Oh no.

2723
04:11:02,640 --> 04:11:04,640
I think it's too late.

2724
04:11:04,640 --> 04:11:08,640
I don't know, something tells me to leave it too late for Mason.

2725
04:11:10,640 --> 04:11:12,640
Someone called at a pineapple moment,

2726
04:11:12,640 --> 04:11:14,640
someone got hungry and ate an onion refill

2727
04:11:14,640 --> 04:11:16,640
and you fell for peppers.

2728
04:11:20,640 --> 04:11:22,640
Oh, we're frying them up.

2729
04:11:22,640 --> 04:11:25,640
Make a Simon just super too much right now.

2730
04:11:25,640 --> 04:11:27,640
I'll be very interested to see how it turns out.

2731
04:11:27,640 --> 04:11:29,640
I'm really excited to use lentils.

2732
04:11:29,640 --> 04:11:31,640
I know, I know, I've been talking about it for days now.

2733
04:11:31,640 --> 04:11:33,640
But look, I just get excited, okay?

2734
04:11:33,640 --> 04:11:36,640
So he's already killed everything in the lab.

2735
04:11:36,640 --> 04:11:38,640
Almost everything.

2736
04:11:38,640 --> 04:11:41,640
Yeah, it's like just straight up a trial.

2737
04:11:43,640 --> 04:11:44,640
Oh, wait, hold on.

2738
04:11:44,640 --> 04:11:47,640
There is a few left behind, but yeah, this makes sense.

2739
04:11:47,640 --> 04:11:49,640
Mason cleared it out.

2740
04:11:59,640 --> 04:12:01,640
He was on the phone to us?

2741
04:12:12,640 --> 04:12:14,640
This door?

2742
04:12:15,640 --> 04:12:17,640
I don't like I died with them.

2743
04:12:17,640 --> 04:12:19,640
Beep boop beep boop, are you gonna let me in?

2744
04:12:20,640 --> 04:12:22,640
I have to open the door, okay.

2745
04:12:24,640 --> 04:12:26,640
We're on the wrong side of the...

2746
04:12:31,640 --> 04:12:35,640
Oh my gosh, yes, I remember.

2747
04:12:39,640 --> 04:12:41,640
Oh.

2748
04:12:43,640 --> 04:12:45,640
Mason, no.

2749
04:12:49,640 --> 04:12:51,640
Let it go.

2750
04:12:51,640 --> 04:12:53,640
Stop it, go to sleep.

2751
04:12:54,640 --> 04:12:55,640
Go to sleep.

2752
04:13:01,640 --> 04:13:03,640
Yeah, there's none to check there.

2753
04:13:03,640 --> 04:13:05,640
There is absolutely none to check.

2754
04:13:13,640 --> 04:13:15,640
He's sleeping.

2755
04:13:20,640 --> 04:13:21,640
Wow.

2756
04:13:31,640 --> 04:13:34,640
I was gonna say, someone gonna pick Mason up.

2757
04:13:34,640 --> 04:13:36,640
Now we're just gonna watch him pass out.

2758
04:13:36,640 --> 04:13:38,640
Oh right, okay, no.

2759
04:13:38,640 --> 04:13:40,640
Wait, so why did he randomly fire there?

2760
04:13:40,640 --> 04:13:42,640
Is there an enemy in this one?

2761
04:13:42,640 --> 04:13:44,640
That's what I'm saying, what did he shoot?

2762
04:13:44,640 --> 04:13:48,640
He just wanted to be like, okay, Steiner's definitely dead.

2763
04:13:49,640 --> 04:13:51,640
Maybe he's reasonable along.

2764
04:14:11,640 --> 04:14:13,640
They must be stopped, Mason.

2765
04:14:22,640 --> 04:14:25,640
Yeah, well, we only got like two more to go?

2766
04:14:28,640 --> 04:14:31,640
That I felt like better on Resnord TV.

2767
04:14:31,640 --> 04:14:33,640
Damn.

2768
04:14:33,640 --> 04:14:36,640
Did that mean he's dressed in press rub off on you?

2769
04:14:36,640 --> 04:14:38,640
He was in for a coup d'etat, he knows how to translate.

2770
04:14:38,640 --> 04:14:40,640
He got strewn and snapped on the kids game.

2771
04:14:42,640 --> 04:14:43,640
Yeah, two more missions.

2772
04:14:43,640 --> 04:14:45,640
Yeah, okay, let's just lock in.

2773
04:14:45,640 --> 04:14:50,640
Seriously, I would take a break in that if there was long ahead,

2774
04:14:50,640 --> 04:14:52,640
but we're really nailing it.

2775
04:14:55,640 --> 04:14:57,640
Okay, I finished my bowling, voilà.

2776
04:15:03,640 --> 04:15:05,640
He's so dramatic.

2777
04:15:07,640 --> 04:15:10,640
Hi, Hudson.

2778
04:15:15,640 --> 04:15:17,640
I thought it was going to be a friendly reunion.

2779
04:15:29,640 --> 04:15:31,640
I've been brainwashed.

2780
04:15:36,640 --> 04:15:38,640
Yeah.

2781
04:15:42,640 --> 04:15:44,640
Rim Nain.

2782
04:15:44,640 --> 04:15:46,640
Alex Mason.

2783
04:15:46,640 --> 04:15:48,640
What are they saying?

2784
04:15:56,640 --> 04:15:58,640
I'd push myself on that.

2785
04:16:01,640 --> 04:16:03,640
We're spiraling.

2786
04:16:07,640 --> 04:16:11,640
The average refling when Momay isn't streaming.

2787
04:16:11,640 --> 04:16:13,640
Where's Bubba?

2788
04:16:13,640 --> 04:16:16,640
I can hear her voice, her accent.

2789
04:16:19,640 --> 04:16:21,640
Oh, it's good, slow-mo.

2790
04:16:21,640 --> 04:16:23,640
It's good, slow-mo.

2791
04:16:25,640 --> 04:16:27,640
Is that for Mason to go even more?

2792
04:16:27,640 --> 04:16:29,640
Oh, I was just holding there.

2793
04:16:29,640 --> 04:16:31,640
Oh.

2794
04:17:00,640 --> 04:17:02,640
He's unusual.

2795
04:17:02,640 --> 04:17:04,640
Atypical.

2796
04:17:04,640 --> 04:17:08,640
Few men possess such will.

2797
04:17:08,640 --> 04:17:12,640
Our other test subjects have been far more successful.

2798
04:17:12,640 --> 04:17:14,640
Why not use them?

2799
04:17:14,640 --> 04:17:16,640
If he was not only one of those intelligent adults,

2800
04:17:16,640 --> 04:17:18,640
then he is of no use to me.

2801
04:17:18,640 --> 04:17:20,640
Aw.

2802
04:17:20,640 --> 04:17:22,640
Take him back to his cell.

2803
04:17:22,640 --> 04:17:24,640
Oh, my God.

2804
04:17:24,640 --> 04:17:26,640
Oh, my God.

2805
04:17:26,640 --> 04:17:28,640
What do you want to say?

2806
04:17:28,640 --> 04:17:30,640
That's all I want you to say.

2807
04:17:30,640 --> 04:17:32,640
Oh, my God.

2808
04:17:35,640 --> 04:17:37,640
This is the target.

2809
04:17:42,640 --> 04:17:44,640
Huh?

2810
04:17:44,640 --> 04:17:46,640
Oh, my God.

2811
04:17:58,640 --> 04:18:00,640
Oh.

2812
04:18:14,640 --> 04:18:16,640
Open the door.

2813
04:18:16,640 --> 04:18:18,640
Open the door.

2814
04:18:18,640 --> 04:18:20,640
Open the door.

2815
04:18:20,640 --> 04:18:22,640
Open the door.

2816
04:18:24,640 --> 04:18:26,640
That's a slimy zone.

2817
04:18:31,640 --> 04:18:33,640
Oh.

2818
04:18:41,640 --> 04:18:43,640
Oh.

2819
04:18:45,640 --> 04:18:47,640
Oh.

2820
04:18:49,640 --> 04:18:53,640
He is crumbling, like, paper.

2821
04:19:00,640 --> 04:19:03,640
You want me on Sunday feeling?

2822
04:19:04,640 --> 04:19:06,640
Oh, sorry.

2823
04:19:08,640 --> 04:19:10,640
Why on Sunday would I be like that?

2824
04:19:10,640 --> 04:19:12,640
Wait, what does that mean?

2825
04:19:12,640 --> 04:19:14,640
Thank you, boy.

2826
04:19:14,640 --> 04:19:16,640
What happened on Monday?

2827
04:19:21,640 --> 04:19:23,640
Oh.

2828
04:19:23,640 --> 04:19:25,640
Oh, Hudson Gauze.

2829
04:19:28,640 --> 04:19:30,640
That slimy zone was just me and Ken.

2830
04:19:30,640 --> 04:19:32,640
Don't worry about it.

2831
04:19:35,640 --> 04:19:37,640
Reznor came to brainwash me.

2832
04:19:43,640 --> 04:19:45,640
Who else is there?

2833
04:19:59,640 --> 04:20:01,640
He was never there.

2834
04:20:12,640 --> 04:20:14,640
No, he wasn't there because I couldn't see him.

2835
04:20:24,640 --> 04:20:26,640
One man, Mason army.

2836
04:20:29,640 --> 04:20:31,640
It's like the game got really quiet all of a sudden.

2837
04:20:42,640 --> 04:20:44,640
Oh, my God.

2838
04:20:47,640 --> 04:20:49,640
Oh, my God.

2839
04:20:59,640 --> 04:21:01,640
One man was there.

2840
04:21:12,640 --> 04:21:14,640
He wanted revenge for all the Dragovich stuff.

2841
04:21:14,640 --> 04:21:17,640
Dragovich, Krakchenko, Steiner, three new victims.

2842
04:21:17,640 --> 04:21:19,640
There are gaps in your memory.

2843
04:21:19,640 --> 04:21:22,640
Periods where you went MIA and we couldn't account for you.

2844
04:21:22,640 --> 04:21:24,640
But now that the brainwashing's been broken,

2845
04:21:24,640 --> 04:21:26,640
all that lost time will come back.

2846
04:21:26,640 --> 04:21:28,640
We need to leave.

2847
04:21:28,640 --> 04:21:30,640
The Nova 6 strike is imminent.

2848
04:21:30,640 --> 04:21:32,640
Hundreds of sleeper agents hidden in every state capital

2849
04:21:32,640 --> 04:21:35,640
are about to unleash this poison on your own countrymen.

2850
04:21:35,640 --> 04:21:37,640
When Steiner died, we lost our key

2851
04:21:37,640 --> 04:21:39,640
to unlocking the location of Numbagrodna.

2852
04:21:39,640 --> 04:21:42,640
You were programmed to conclude to translate the number code.

2853
04:21:42,640 --> 04:21:45,640
Only you can tell us what the codes mean.

2854
04:21:45,640 --> 04:21:48,640
Nova 6 was just one of the sleeper operations.

2855
04:21:48,640 --> 04:21:51,640
But I'm sure there were others, ones we didn't even know about.

2856
04:21:52,640 --> 04:21:54,640
We have the broadcast.

2857
04:21:54,640 --> 04:21:56,640
We played them to you over and over again for hours,

2858
04:21:56,640 --> 04:21:59,640
but we haven't been able to break through your programming yet.

2859
04:21:59,640 --> 04:22:01,640
Mason, this is our last shot.

2860
04:22:01,640 --> 04:22:04,640
Listen, for God's sake, listen again.

2861
04:22:04,640 --> 04:22:14,640
21, 7, 21, 4, 2, 14, 3, 14, 7, 18, 13, 6.

2862
04:22:15,640 --> 04:22:17,640
Do what you wish, General.

2863
04:22:17,640 --> 04:22:20,640
This might give to you an honourable relationship.

2864
04:22:25,640 --> 04:22:28,640
You don't know what we did to you.

2865
04:22:30,640 --> 04:22:32,640
The subject has been successfully implanted

2866
04:22:32,640 --> 04:22:35,640
with the knowledge to translate the number sequences.

2867
04:23:02,640 --> 04:23:06,640
Plan to strike at the very heart of the West is now in motion.

2868
04:23:06,640 --> 04:23:09,640
Await further instructions.

2869
04:23:12,640 --> 04:23:13,640
We know.

2870
04:23:13,640 --> 04:23:15,640
Do what you wish, General.

2871
04:23:15,640 --> 04:23:18,640
This might give to you an honourable relationship.

2872
04:23:18,640 --> 04:23:20,640
An honourable relationship.

2873
04:23:21,640 --> 04:23:25,640
Permanent broadcast station within their portals.

2874
04:23:25,640 --> 04:23:29,640
All these questions will be broadcast from the radio station.

2875
04:23:32,640 --> 04:23:34,640
Would the numbers mean?

2876
04:23:34,640 --> 04:23:35,640
It's a ship.

2877
04:23:35,640 --> 04:23:37,640
I saw it a long time ago.

2878
04:23:37,640 --> 04:23:38,640
The Rosalga.

2879
04:23:39,640 --> 04:23:40,640
Where?

2880
04:23:40,640 --> 04:23:41,640
Cuba.

2881
04:23:44,640 --> 04:23:45,640
I hit it!

2882
04:23:45,640 --> 04:23:48,640
Not the guitar riff in sunglasses.

2883
04:23:50,640 --> 04:23:52,640
Oh my God, that was funny.

2884
04:23:52,640 --> 04:23:53,640
Sorry.

2885
04:23:55,640 --> 04:23:58,640
I probably would have had a laugh and fit over that if I wasn't tired.

2886
04:23:58,640 --> 04:23:59,640
I'm not even gonna lie.

2887
04:23:59,640 --> 04:24:01,640
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

2888
04:24:01,640 --> 04:24:03,640
Sunglasses.

2889
04:24:10,640 --> 04:24:12,640
Wait, they put Mason back in the fight?

2890
04:24:18,640 --> 04:24:19,640
That was badass.

2891
04:24:22,640 --> 04:24:24,640
Aw yeah, guitar riff.

2892
04:24:29,640 --> 04:24:33,840
I'm here to kick ass and chew bubblegum

2893
04:24:39,520 --> 04:24:43,100
It's time to fuck ass and chew gum I'm all over what

2894
04:24:48,600 --> 04:24:52,680
Wait, is that a different what wait you both said the same meme

2895
04:24:54,440 --> 04:24:57,760
This I mean, I don't know about I'm out in the means here

2896
04:24:59,640 --> 04:25:01,640
Alpha we got

2897
04:25:01,880 --> 04:25:03,880
Golf of Mexico

2898
04:25:04,400 --> 04:25:08,000
Viva la Mexico, hola come as a

2899
04:25:10,560 --> 04:25:12,560
Hola

2900
04:25:13,880 --> 04:25:20,980
So I can drive sorry, I didn't realize I was driving

2901
04:25:22,360 --> 04:25:27,120
Sorry about that old chap that was me didn't realize I could drive this. That's a rather embarrassing

2902
04:25:27,760 --> 04:25:33,280
Do excuse me. Let me go around the outside around the outside of the bow of the boat

2903
04:25:38,320 --> 04:25:45,000
Something's getting me. Oh dear. Oh dear. I'm being a I'm being wrecked as the young and sending wrecked

2904
04:25:54,760 --> 04:25:56,760
One more

2905
04:25:58,000 --> 04:26:05,120
We secured the landing zone protect and attack. No protect. Okay. Just protect got it. I

2906
04:26:09,000 --> 04:26:11,000
Mean I'm spamming

2907
04:26:12,360 --> 04:26:14,360
I'm spamming I

2908
04:26:17,160 --> 04:26:22,360
Keep overheating though. I think that's a me problem with the way I play this game

2909
04:26:23,360 --> 04:26:30,680
Bruh, there's no way you would even dare to exit if there's three Huey's above spamming. I

2910
04:26:31,920 --> 04:26:36,200
Shant I shan't believe it. I shan't believe such risk-taking

2911
04:26:41,680 --> 04:26:46,800
I'm trying to hit him I'm doing a terrible job

2912
04:26:49,360 --> 04:26:51,360
What do you mean get you closer

2913
04:26:53,360 --> 04:26:57,000
Am I didn't cover fire for a ground unit that way

2914
04:27:00,480 --> 04:27:06,040
Okay, did we do it? I think we did it. We're doing it. We're on Rosalga

2915
04:27:09,760 --> 04:27:12,200
Wow, I can't believe they actually tagged me in though

2916
04:27:12,840 --> 04:27:18,440
Like I'm not being funny if you were found to be an agent and like doing all this stuff

2917
04:27:18,600 --> 04:27:20,920
They would null you back on the team, right?

2918
04:27:23,280 --> 04:27:25,280
I

2919
04:27:29,520 --> 04:27:32,640
Stop moving stop resisting

2920
04:27:34,600 --> 04:27:39,160
The thing went in my way well, hopefully it saved all that progress

2921
04:27:42,240 --> 04:27:48,720
Right do you you're the baddie know that the freaking ally choppers and like right in my face I

2922
04:27:49,440 --> 04:27:51,440

04:27:51,640 --> 04:27:54,560
Are you doing it again go away?

2924
04:27:56,640 --> 04:28:02,800
If you're just gonna be a detriment get out of my face my frickin teammate

04:28:18,000 --> 04:28:20,000
No, you're getting rammed. Sorry

04:28:20,960 --> 04:28:23,560

Oh

2938
04:29:07,880 --> 04:29:12,480
Now all I'm gonna see is that we have caused a heck of a lot of destruction

2939
04:29:12,480 --> 04:29:14,480
I can't imagine how many men were

2940
04:29:14,880 --> 04:29:21,680
Manned on the ship, but I feel like we've already decimated a lot of their numbers. It may be controversial, but I

2941
04:29:22,960 --> 04:29:24,960
Feel like they should oh have two

2942
04:29:26,320 --> 04:29:32,000
Editions on this one. I have a red dot say and Joe what's mag which means my reed old times is super fast

2943
04:29:32,800 --> 04:29:34,800
I

2944
04:29:37,760 --> 04:29:40,000
I'm trying to get that red barrel to blow up

2945
04:29:42,360 --> 04:29:44,360
That's shit

2946
04:29:46,000 --> 04:29:48,000
Wow, I'm not touching it

2947
04:29:50,240 --> 04:29:55,120

Don't have to tell me twice don't have to tell me twice. This is my favorite kind of mission. No

2949
04:30:02,800 --> 04:30:04,800

04:30:05,080 --> 04:30:07,080
I love a bit of destruction

2951
04:30:15,720 --> 04:30:20,120
Sometimes the attachments actually change how spread works as well, so maybe doesn't spread

2952
04:30:23,040 --> 04:30:25,040
It usually does

2953
04:30:26,000 --> 04:30:28,000
I

2954
04:30:28,560 --> 04:30:35,620
Know now now I don't I'm going to pretend that the spread is different, so I'm gonna have to use ABS now

2955
04:30:41,880 --> 04:30:43,880
We're doing it we're doing it

2956
04:30:49,440 --> 04:30:53,740

2961
04:31:14,560 --> 04:31:17,440
Instantly my crosshair goes on to the the allies

2962
04:31:18,520 --> 04:31:23,960
That's why I am a combat medic and nothing more. I have no more no more of an asset

2963
04:31:25,360 --> 04:31:27,360
Oh

2964
04:31:28,880 --> 04:31:36,200

Nutty boy. Oh, you so naughty. Oh, yeah, naughty boy. Oh, you get spanking

2967
04:31:50,840 --> 04:31:52,840

04:31:53,080 --> 04:31:59,720
Wonder if it will be verbal deck. Hi weaver. Where are you? You're Hudson your sergeant edwards

2969
04:32:00,640 --> 04:32:02,640
station it's beneath us

2970
04:32:05,480 --> 04:32:07,480
Not certainly broadcast

2971
04:32:09,280 --> 04:32:13,240
Come on, this is alpha wood. We have confirmed the result is the broadcast source

2972
04:32:13,760 --> 04:32:20,080
Combat paper for moral support. I'm here. Not a boy. Not a boy. Not a boy. Oh

2973
04:32:20,960 --> 04:32:26,640

2974
04:32:29,160 --> 04:32:31,160
Yeah, not a boy

04:32:35,960 --> 04:32:38,680
We're gonna finish this you are both nutty and

2976
04:32:51,240 --> 04:32:57,000
Overdivers, whoa, this is amazing. We built this

2977
04:33:04,720 --> 04:33:09,680
I feel like we need to decompress a bit, you know before we why what's going on

2978
04:33:12,160 --> 04:33:17,920
How's that was strange, I don't think I was actually supposed to like fall there or something I

2979
04:33:20,560 --> 04:33:25,440
It's not really letting me steer him like I can't go up or down. I'm just pressing W right now

2980
04:33:25,440 --> 04:33:28,480
So I think I think I'm being Disney raid parked

2981
04:33:29,560 --> 04:33:31,720
And I'm secretly on a track

2982
04:33:33,880 --> 04:33:37,400
The compression is more important for ascending

2983
04:33:38,720 --> 04:33:43,240
The like mushrooms way, yeah, I've got mushrooms for my soup

2984
04:33:43,440 --> 04:33:52,280
Okay, this is dangerous, I see why this game became so popular just for how much oh

2985
04:33:52,880 --> 04:33:55,380
I assume we're a lot of fire, right surely. I

2986
04:33:56,360 --> 04:34:01,760
Don't know if I was supposed to be a bit quiet like if we had suppressors or what but

2987
04:34:02,680 --> 04:34:04,680
I'm going in guns ablaze and

I

3011
04:36:30,000 --> 04:36:32,240
Okay, it seems like they have weakened the hedge

3012
04:36:36,000 --> 04:36:38,000
Fight me so I'm gonna just leave them

3013
04:36:43,000 --> 04:36:45,000

Can we put our disc goodbye diving gear on again?

3023
04:37:47,800 --> 04:37:54,320

3049
04:41:17,760 --> 04:41:19,760
And it makes me scared so

3050

04:44:22,040 --> 04:44:26,400
All right, I'm making stuff up. I'll make stuff up. Don't think I won't make stuff up off the top of my head

3092
04:44:26,400 --> 04:44:28,400
I'll just make stuff up if I want all willy-nilly

3093
04:44:28,800 --> 04:44:35,680
Musicians you made the coolest like little background doonoo and that that was it city of Kowloon

3094
04:44:36,000 --> 04:44:41,160
That background music and that one. I'm I'm I'm popping that bad boy up, okay?

3095
04:44:41,920 --> 04:44:45,920
That was good additional original music composition Kevin ten out of time

3096
04:44:46,600 --> 04:44:48,600
gorgeous, stunning

3097
04:44:48,600 --> 04:44:54,720
Fantastic special thanks and to you the player. I don't know if they do that, but it would be cute if they did it

3098
04:44:55,440 --> 04:45:01,720
Additional writing Howard thanks Howard for your writing military and historical consultants

3099
04:45:01,720 --> 04:45:03,120
Don't think we weren't thinking about you

3100
04:45:03,120 --> 04:45:07,600
We like the historical accuracy of the flashbacks, especially Victor Reznov's flashbacks

3101
04:45:08,040 --> 04:45:15,240
Using time period gun relevant things. We love it here. We appreciate that attention to detail keep that up game studios

3102
04:45:15,240 --> 04:45:17,840
I understand you get paid in pennies

3103
04:45:18,240 --> 04:45:20,960
So we are thankful when you go above and beyond

3104
04:45:21,280 --> 04:45:24,320
We do not expect that and yet you still go for it

3105
04:45:24,320 --> 04:45:29,280
Even though the masses have yet to learn and acknowledge that it is not your studios that are the problem

3106
04:45:29,280 --> 04:45:32,680
It is the big guys breathing down your neck

3107
04:45:32,680 --> 04:45:36,560
We thank you for your sacrifice in both your health and your

3108
04:45:38,440 --> 04:45:45,960
Your personal life to make others happy and one day just know that the masses will understand that you are not the problem game

3109
04:45:45,960 --> 04:45:47,960
Studio it never was you it was always

3110
04:45:48,920 --> 04:45:50,920
the big

3111
04:45:52,120 --> 04:45:54,120
The publishers and

3112
04:45:55,080 --> 04:45:58,400
Slowly the masses will come to learn and hate

3113
04:45:59,880 --> 04:46:01,880
the correct

3114
04:46:04,520 --> 04:46:07,920
They were brave to show the real assassination or two I

3115
04:46:08,880 --> 04:46:12,760
Was like rather out there you live a touchy subject

3116
04:46:12,760 --> 04:46:16,120
No, but I mean I guess a couple of years have passed by that point

3117
04:46:17,120 --> 04:46:25,680
Certain affinity more like certain quality. Thank you for your contributions to black ops one activision

3118
04:46:27,760 --> 04:46:29,760
Again, don't hate the team

3119
04:46:30,760 --> 04:46:32,680
Hate the publishers

3120
04:46:32,680 --> 04:46:41,400
So head of production Steve you did fantastic SVP Dave. Thank you. Yeah global brand management more like global gold

3121
04:46:41,560 --> 04:46:43,560
You can

3122
04:46:45,080 --> 04:46:49,160
What is this random music from the game

3123
04:46:54,120 --> 04:46:56,120
What

3124
04:46:59,760 --> 04:47:01,760
That's Eminem

3125
04:47:05,000 --> 04:47:07,000
They got an Eminem song

3126
04:47:08,000 --> 04:47:13,160
DMCA I don't I think we'll be okay that I don't have to take down the board

3127
04:47:13,160 --> 04:47:16,840
I think it'll just be like I can't monetize it or anything. We're just fighting

3128
04:47:18,880 --> 04:47:21,280
He said this word he said

3129
04:47:23,920 --> 04:47:29,720
It was cool in 2010, I didn't know he was that I remember like

3130
04:47:31,120 --> 04:47:33,120
Did the zombie one

3131
04:47:34,120 --> 04:47:36,960
Did you want to punch lines

3132
04:47:38,880 --> 04:47:40,880
Shake it like a donkey will park

3133
04:47:41,960 --> 04:47:47,440
We're gonna crash gets to monetize. Yeah, basically. I think this one's for the game

3134
04:47:47,440 --> 04:47:53,920
Yeah, like custom he made a song for cod ghost as well. Did activision cough up the goods? I

3135
04:47:54,840 --> 04:48:00,200
Know that call the duty's been advertising on like drink brands in the UK

3136
04:48:00,200 --> 04:48:02,960
Which they don't normally do but this was years ago now

3137
04:48:02,960 --> 04:48:08,160
I was just very surprised seeing it like they did they did it with Doritos and they did it with this

3138
04:48:09,120 --> 04:48:11,200
energy drink to advertise cod

3139
04:48:13,200 --> 04:48:15,200
I division has pockets

3140
04:48:18,520 --> 04:48:24,320
Marketing communications. Thank you Susan. See it's all chicks. That's when the chicks come in

3141
04:48:25,320 --> 04:48:31,600
All the chicks come in when it comes to like advertise and to know that but like that's a dead site of things

3142
04:48:31,600 --> 04:48:33,520
It's like nothing

3143
04:48:33,520 --> 04:48:35,320
traffic coordinate or

3144
04:48:35,320 --> 04:48:37,320
Sheila Sheila

3145
04:48:40,080 --> 04:48:42,600
Can you believe they're trying to cancel Eminem

3146
04:48:44,400 --> 04:48:47,720
Eminem getting it trying to cancel me bruh Genzini bruh

3147
04:48:48,400 --> 04:48:50,400
I

3148
04:48:52,000 --> 04:48:54,320
Yeah, he made survival of the fitters for college

3149
04:48:55,400 --> 04:48:58,200
How am I being so daft that I can't remember any of this?

3150
04:48:58,200 --> 04:49:02,800
I'm sure I probably knew it and I'm just like completely like bended it. I'm like not really relevant

3151
04:49:02,960 --> 04:49:05,520
I'm gonna say I like ghost a lot when we play campaign

3152
04:49:07,800 --> 04:49:12,120
I like alien modding ghost is the best go media

3153
04:49:18,720 --> 04:49:21,440
I think she must yeah alien

3154
04:49:28,120 --> 04:49:31,280
I'm Genzi and even I love it. I don't wanna him cancel whether one

3155
04:49:32,520 --> 04:49:37,040
No, do you know no it's a meme no one's trying to cancel anyone Eminem no one gives a shit

3156
04:49:38,480 --> 04:49:43,120
The joke was like Eminem comes out and it's like they're trying to cancel me

3157
04:49:43,120 --> 04:49:47,640
They're trying to Genzini bruh and everyone's like what are you on about no one's talking about you

3158
04:49:49,240 --> 04:49:51,240
Because he's always been like

3159
04:49:51,920 --> 04:49:57,760
But you don't have to like like I hate to be that person's like but if you look past the lyrics like he is actually

3160
04:49:59,960 --> 04:50:05,640
Ghost was a decent game multiplayer. I didn't enjoy ghost multiplayer. No, I remember the credit

3161
04:50:06,640 --> 04:50:08,240
I

3162
04:50:08,240 --> 04:50:13,800
Was about to say I was like why the music just go down and it goes why'd you turn me down turn me up?

3163
04:50:14,200 --> 04:50:20,240
They got me they got me. I got pranked. I was like oh a bit to have like a voice over

3164
04:50:21,400 --> 04:50:27,640
I thought technical requirements got I did not realize how much it takes to make one freaking game. This is crazy

3165
04:50:30,360 --> 04:50:32,840
Considering like they had assets from

3166
04:50:33,680 --> 04:50:38,440
Well, I think they had assets from world at war like

3167
04:50:44,600 --> 04:50:49,360
Guards they ring the guards ring the guards. They're making a mockery up. Yeah ring the guards

3168
04:50:52,240 --> 04:50:54,240
Black Ops is cool if you just scream

3169
04:50:55,200 --> 04:51:04,160
Please no more copyright music you're really limiting my chances black ops if this actually remain enough

3170
04:51:04,160 --> 04:51:09,960
I'm gonna cry if this doesn't remain up. I will literally have to like manually yank my own board and then like

3171
04:51:10,160 --> 04:51:15,960
Download it and cut out all the DMCA sections because I am not having this break my freaking stream streak

3172
04:51:15,960 --> 04:51:18,920
I will go off stream and if it says like

3173
04:51:19,920 --> 04:51:27,000
Copyright blocked and I can't do anything about it. You bet your ass. I'm gonna boot up a yaps stream for like an hour

3174
04:51:27,000 --> 04:51:32,080
I'm not having my stream streak broken due to it. He's she copyright because

3175
04:51:32,840 --> 04:51:36,280
because the developers Activision like

3176
04:51:36,800 --> 04:51:43,240
Publish the rights to use the song in the game any gamer that plays the game in streams that should be protected

3177
04:51:43,240 --> 04:51:45,960
But they're not I don't know why this isn't a thing. Okay

3178
04:51:46,760 --> 04:51:48,760
five-minute yaps stream

3179
04:51:49,120 --> 04:51:54,640
I will I'll go off stream. I'll make a cup of tea and I'll do a yeah, don't think I won't

3180
04:51:55,600 --> 04:51:57,440
Don't think I won't

3181
04:51:57,440 --> 04:52:02,680
Is there any just the other girls online right now that I can redirect into?

3182
04:52:04,320 --> 04:52:08,200
I'm gonna let it run until it tells me about cold zombies. I'm gonna cry. No

3183
04:52:19,600 --> 04:52:21,600
Okay

3184
04:52:28,040 --> 04:52:30,040

He lost as I always say to give your enemies, but remember their names

3188
04:52:47,800 --> 04:52:49,800
And he's on a membership

3189
04:52:59,760 --> 04:53:01,760

3190
04:53:11,280 --> 04:53:15,400
I like it zombies that's it Phil stop zombies no explanation zombies

3191
04:53:17,440 --> 04:53:19,440
I

3192
04:53:22,240 --> 04:53:24,240
Gentlemen lock it down

3193
04:53:32,320 --> 04:53:35,400
Why did they make president Nixon's little monkey like

3194
04:53:40,760 --> 04:53:43,920
Okay, but seriously though Rahi look like

3195
04:53:48,020 --> 04:53:50,020
No

3196
04:53:51,120 --> 04:53:55,280
No, I ain't doing this. I would eat energy. We need power

3197
04:53:56,200 --> 04:53:58,720
We need power more power

3198
04:54:00,200 --> 04:54:05,660
Hanoi, Moscow, New York, Hong Kong the Pentagon. We're at Defconn one

3199
04:54:09,840 --> 04:54:16,880
Right no, we're done. I was gonna muck about until they started but I'm like now you're done. We're not doing that

3200
04:54:17,040 --> 04:54:23,120
I'm too scared. I'm too scared. I'm too scared. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it

3201
04:54:23,120 --> 04:54:25,120
I'm scared deep and oh

3202
04:54:29,080 --> 04:54:34,040
No, you don't know what you talk about it's not a stick up anymore. It's just me

3203
04:54:35,880 --> 04:54:42,240
Right, it's that young study on you just stay over there. You just leave yourself. It's not a stick up. I promise. I'm behaving

3204
04:54:43,120 --> 04:54:45,720
I'm behaving fake arms. No

3205
04:54:46,480 --> 04:54:51,040
No, that's not him. Well, I said some beat you first work like that

3206
04:54:54,200 --> 04:54:56,200
a

3207
04:54:56,800 --> 04:55:02,040
Did you end up feeding the birds on the way back from the shop with a the soup chicken?

3208
04:55:02,720 --> 04:55:07,880
No, they never came to me. Although I met a nice lady on a walk

3209
04:55:08,200 --> 04:55:13,720
Like on the walk back and she was just feeding the magpies in general, but not my magpies

3210
04:55:13,720 --> 04:55:19,480
I don't know those aren't my magpies and I kid you not there is nine magpies around her and I was like

3211
04:55:19,480 --> 04:55:23,640
Oh, fuck. Yeah, I'm like having a flash into like my retirement even though I get to do it now

3212
04:55:23,640 --> 04:55:26,640
So that doesn't really make sense at all truly

3213
04:55:26,640 --> 04:55:28,640
Um

3214
04:55:44,000 --> 04:55:46,000
One round

3215
04:55:46,160 --> 04:55:50,000
No, I don't give me money to be scared. That's different

3216
04:55:50,960 --> 04:55:52,960
I

3217
04:55:55,120 --> 04:55:59,040
Can I show you guys can I leak something I'm just gonna I'm just gonna tell her

3218
04:56:04,400 --> 04:56:10,000
Uh, I'm just gonna leak it. I'm just gonna I've literally put I'm gonna show it on stream. I hope that's okay

3219
04:56:12,160 --> 04:56:15,280
Oh, please don't get mad at me. I love you

3220
04:56:15,920 --> 04:56:21,040
Love you, please don't get mad at me for leaking everything because I can't hold back anything from the replay

3221
04:56:22,240 --> 04:56:24,720
And that's okay. Sometimes that's okay

3222
04:56:26,400 --> 04:56:28,400
Sometimes it's okay

3223
04:56:28,400 --> 04:56:30,960
Are you ready? What happens tomorrow?

3224
04:56:32,080 --> 04:56:34,080
Oh

3225
04:56:34,080 --> 04:56:36,080
It's tainate. No go back

3226
04:56:37,600 --> 04:56:39,600
Oh, shit she beats the wrong color. Fuck

3227
04:56:40,400 --> 04:56:42,160
Okay, this was before

3228
04:56:42,160 --> 04:56:44,160
This was before

3229
04:56:44,240 --> 04:56:50,000
Sheepster's got our tan. Okay. This is before but we all go humanized. Look, we're all humans

3230
04:56:50,640 --> 04:56:52,640
We're gonna be your maids

3231
04:56:53,280 --> 04:56:57,200
But who are we collabing with? Well, if ain't other none other

3232
04:56:58,080 --> 04:57:02,720
Then baby pink ASMR. Hey, I will tweet about it. So don't worry. You're not gonna miss it

3233
04:57:03,280 --> 04:57:06,960
Hey, but look, we're all humanized. We'll have human eyes as well

3234
04:57:07,280 --> 04:57:12,160
Um, I see doesn't have her bare ears and she got hair like tied back and

3235
04:57:12,640 --> 04:57:16,480
Mercy still has her eye patch though, because you know, she still wants to do the yandere thing

3236
04:57:17,280 --> 04:57:19,280
but like emi's little um

3237
04:57:20,560 --> 04:57:25,760
We pumpkin things are gone because she's all hicks out the wazoo as her ears are gone

3238
04:57:26,000 --> 04:57:30,640
Shebe's bun bun ears are gone. I'm human too. Look. I ain't got my teeth like she

3239
04:57:31,920 --> 04:57:33,920
Now now my teeth you

3240
04:57:34,400 --> 04:57:37,280
Hey, I see without ears. It's weird, but neat

3241
04:57:38,000 --> 04:57:40,480
It's very cute. I think it's very cute

3242
04:57:40,880 --> 04:57:45,440
But yeah, like like emi's eyeballs don't have crosses or anything. No one has like

3243
04:57:46,080 --> 04:57:49,920
Specialized eyes. We all got human eyes for the maid camp campaign campaign

3244
04:57:50,720 --> 04:57:52,320
for the Mead collab

3245
04:57:52,320 --> 04:57:56,640
Yeah, so that's from baby pink baby pinks channel tomorrow

3246
04:57:57,440 --> 04:58:01,760
Um, and then there's one more big old collab like that

3247

3481
05:26:17,520 --> 05:26:26,240
low branches stands on climb tree up a tree you are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among

3482
05:26:26,240 --> 05:26:32,320
some large branches the nearest branch above you is above your reach beside you on the branches

3483
05:26:32,320 --> 05:26:37,120
of the small bird's nest and the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels

3484
05:26:37,120 --> 05:26:46,320
apparently scavenged by a childless songbird what is this this egg is covered with fine gold in lay

3485
05:26:46,320 --> 05:26:53,280
and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother of peril unlike most eggs this one is hinged

hacker so i could see equipment and like a suppressor um and i did the the uav shoot down thing

3570
05:37:33,520 --> 05:37:38,320

3577
05:38:19,840 --> 05:38:23,600
bit since journal got released they were saying their servers are dead i don't know how true that

3578
05:38:23,600 --> 05:38:29,360
is obviously i'm not played overwatching like yon's um maybe didn't know i used to be a bit of an

05:38:29,360 --> 05:38:39,680
evil over overwatch overwatch fiend um and i used to like i used to game okay i have a stupid

3580
05:38:39,680 --> 05:38:43,600
