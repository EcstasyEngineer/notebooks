Look at me doing baby puzzles, let's go. Maybe I can do the soft or all maybe I can

43
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
There's hope

There's a shortcut for collecting items for the get 10 balls

45
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,320
What happened to the music? Um, what the fuck?

46
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
To the music

47
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:04,280
Your music died, why can't I hear anything? Hello, you hear me music?

48
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,260
Yeah, I don't know what happened. I couldn't hear anything

49
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,260
Oh

50
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,100
Just randomly I couldn't hear anything

86
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,740
Okay, mysterious toy. Oh, there's another piece

87
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,340
The puzzle piece that I can put in this thing

88
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,940
Oh, sorry, I'm sorry. Oh, sorry. Sorry. I just stream sniped her. I just stream sniped her. I'm so sorry

89
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:13,620
I say I literally just stream sniped that. Oh my god. Oh my god. I don't know if I lost the piece

90
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Did it not go in?

91
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,580
I don't know if I lost the

92
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:23,780
The puzzle piece. Oh, no, we're not wait. Oh, no, it's so over. Wait if it no, no, no

93
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,020
It must have went on is in your inventory scroll with your mouse wheel to check out your inventory

94
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,300
Uh, I don't have anything. Oh, there's another one

95
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,980
Oh, you see if you find any baby manual things we go on this little board here

96
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,180
Oh with now we just need two more

97
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
One two more puzzle pieces

98
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,380
That doesn't look like a puzzle at all. I've done it

99
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
Yeah, okay

100
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,860
I'll investigate this plant to the best of my ability

101
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,300
I love how cute this room is

102
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,580
The game's actually a really cute one overall

103
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,460
All right

104
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,860
I'm trying my best to find like

105
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,780
The other puzzle pieces right now. That's what I'm focusing on. We need a cord. It's

106
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,020
It's got a badge and a plus sign. I don't know if that means anything

107
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,980
Have you found what?

108
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:28,340
The this like lock here has like a badge and a plus sign on top of it. I don't know if that means anything

109
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,980
I really need to stop picking puzzle games for collab games now that I think about it. This is getting out of reach

110
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,060
Okay

111
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,060
Okay, I thought maybe there's a puzzle piece in there, but I guess not

112
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,580
A ball

113
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,660
I hope you find your way home always yours. Una. Who's Una?

114
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,940
I have no idea

115
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,740
It's not part of your puzzle, but it's a part of something. All right

116
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,100
Do you I'm going to put it on the table

117
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:14,500
But if you have an inclination of where the heck this piece goes, that's so random

118
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:20,820
Which piece that the tape misty. It says mysterious key, but it doesn't look like it fits on anything

119
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,700
Oh

120
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,700
I guess I put it here for now

121
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,900
Can I do anything with the cat? Let me see

122
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,700
Is there anything hidden?

123
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:37,140
Is it a little hole? The plan is sus. Is it? And I'll interrogate it. I don't think I won't

124
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,100
Everything looks like distortion, but it can't be

125
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,780
I

126
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,460
Token found you found a secret trick and look around to find more you found it

127
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,140
I did not find it. I found a secret token, but I don't know

128
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,580
I don't know what it's on the ship

129
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,420
It means does that take a look at your legs by accident?

130
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,780
Okay

131
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,100
Oh

132
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,580
Is there anything in here you got pinged again better not

133
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,820
Anything in you can bend stuff in the dress

134
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,740
Bro, I'm so sorry, but we're actually stuck on the tutorial level

135
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,660
Look, I found another puzzle. Oh, oh, is it the last one? Oh, no, there's one more. No, no, no, no

136
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,140
No

137
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,340
One more I need one more

138
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,420
Wait, wait, hold on zero seven

139
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,380
It says a badge, but there's no such thing

140
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,580
Viller in puzzles the literal enemy, bro

141
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,940
Oh

142
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,940
Where's do you have the cage?

143
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,300
Uh, I think it's back outside

144
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,300
I brought it in

145
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:17,140
On the bed but it's gone. Oh, where'd you find the cage? It was just on the bird's nest. I guess it's not there

146
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,220
Wait, can we go back in the trash?

147
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,820
I don't know it says it's empty. Oh, I have it. I have it. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

148
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,060
Let me see

149
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:36,420
Uh, oh, I see it. Whatever it is. Can you touch it? Let me grab it

150
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,020
I was trying to figure out the control but we're stuck at the tutorial

151
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:50,660
I can't open it or nothing press spacebar when it's in your inventory

152
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,780
You should be able to interact with it

153
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,300
Yeah, I'm trying to interact with it, but like

154
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,020
Oh, okay, okay

155
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:09,460
Oh, I uh, oh, no, it's fine. I got the right thing. I'll put it around. There you go. Esteban. I bet you it was you Esteban

156
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,380
I bet you it was you

157
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,380
Oh, Esteban has a thing in his ear

158
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:20,580
I just find the secret look in what was in the birth key. I don't I don't think that does anything

159
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,260
Huh, I thought I thought maybe putting in the birth

160
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,300
birth

161
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,340
In the birth cage would do something

162
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,380
What's this mysterious key nothing in this room looks like it needs a key like that

163
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:49,380
There's a hint button beside the door. Oh, is there actually why am I pinging? What the hell is this thing?

164
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:56,420
There's no right. Okay. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. Can I push the hint button or do you want no hints?

165
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,780
Give hints. There was never a tutorial. I'm too embarrassed

166
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,140
Oh, what's the hint? Are you joking?

167
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:13,780
It's literally just a picture of the chest and nothing else. Yeah, we know the chest is locked. You don't need to tell us

168
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,780
That's it. Wow. Thanks for nothing. Literally give us another one

169
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,060
Right. Okay. So the hint is a police badge and the plus thing

170
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,860
This on the map

171
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:37,300
Five go to the police station to the hospital. Hold on a minute. Wait five

172
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,060
Five six four

173
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
But the block is

174
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,740
Bruh

175
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,620
What nine five six four. Fuck it. I'm guessing I'm guessing nine. Oh, sorry. You were just

176
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,180
Tell me about you. You do it. You do it. Wait. I'll say nine five six four

177
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:13,620
And before it's not it's not that damn what the heck bro, you need to give us a better hint than that. I'm not kidding

178
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,740
What zero at the end then

179
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:29,380
Okay, it's five six four zero or something like that or zero. I wonder

180
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,540
I can't believe five six four zero

181
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,220
I didn't oh, I don't know. Why did you I didn't even do that, right? But we

182
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,300
Yay, we did it. Yay

183
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,660
Mummy there's blocks

184
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,780
Oh, we did it. We're out. Oh my god. We did the tutorial. Let's go

185
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,660
Oh my god, we did the freaking tutorial. Oh my god

186
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:10,820
Really? My god camera. That's kind of scary. Look at us dancing. That's you in my head. Look at that

187
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,700
Oh my god, you're biggie. You should be in there

188
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
This oh my god

189
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,060
I can't believe we actually escaped the room

190
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,900
I thought we're gonna be stuck here for two hours. Oh my god, you're breaking this. Wait, you can move

191
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:33,060
All right. Yeah, oops. No, no, don't worry. All right. We're gonna go to egypt. You've been to egypt before

192
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,580
No

193
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,300
So and now we're gonna be stuck there forever. We're gonna die like we're gonna die

194
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,220
Oh god, why is there a timer? I'm never gonna be able to swim again

195
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:55,940
There's a timer. Literally. What the heck? I think we're about to get like encased in tomb in sand here

196
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:03,860
Are we? I don't know. Uh, I think I'm gonna be there. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm opening something. Oh, oh

197
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,660
Something inside

198
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:14,900
Okay, I will give me the thing. Hello tools. There's something inside the flask, but I can't take it out

199
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,180
Really click on it or

200
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,340
Like

201
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,740
Oh my god

202
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,700
Oh my god, I'm cleaning so hard right now. Oh, I'm such a woman

203
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,500
Oh, you're right. See there's the thing inside but like I can yeah, it keeps like

204
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:47,620
Moving wait, what the heck stay still. Yeah, we'll let me click it because it keeps bouncing off

205
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,220
You get put in the corner of shit

206
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,940
Is there anything else that can stand it? Uh

207
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,340
Is that wood? Oh look found something

208
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,460
Inside the vase

209
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,300
I don't know what that is, but I assume we will need it

210
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,460
Because there's like there's another piece. Look, there's two pieces of these

211
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,740
Oh

212
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,780
Oh, you did it ac

213
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,660
Wait, what did I do in the middle here?

214
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,860
Oh

215
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,820
Now what oh

216
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,380
They're together

217
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,020
We put the sphinx back on

218
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,260
No, we don't we don't

219
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,580
I wonder how to use the shower

220
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,220
I'm investigating

221
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:03,700
I'm uh, I need to look at the boot. Oh you found something. Oh

222
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,060
I wonder what the numbers are

223
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,020
Wait, I need to actually translate a book

224
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,740
Egyptian alphabet, is this real?

225
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,980
Oh

226
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,100
I wonder if like you need to like translate this thing. Oh, no

227
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,340
Oh

228
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,820
Oh

229
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,260
Wait, is there a book in that suitcase? Oh wait, I've got a freaking suitcase

230
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,100
Right, hold on. Give me that book

231
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:50,740
Give me that I need to start putting stuff down when I'm not using it because I'm not letting you investigate if I'm holding it in my inventory

232
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,100
How do I put that down? It's okay place

233
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,700
Oh

234
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,860
So what this I'm really oh here we go right. Okay. Okay

235
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,580
Can I write?

236
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:10,980
Oh my god, wait, I'm simple. Oh, right. This code is for the dominoes here, but from the boot. Right. What is it?

237
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,620
A girly skirt

238
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,180
One thousand

239
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,740
Okay

240
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:25,140
I'm supposed to put those numbers together without a piece of paper. Oh my gosh. Wait, so there's three thousand

241
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,540
Oh

242
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,700
My god, this is I'm I think I'm over complicated in this because

243
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,540
Is this

244
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,260
I'm just like picking up random items and I don't know what the fuck to do with it. Oh, you did it

245
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,540
Oh, you got an achievement. I got destroyed with an inventory for breaking it. Yeah, I'm doing like

246
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:51,220
Fucking nothing. Let's go. Oh my god. Wait, so this spiral is a hundred

247
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,340
I like the most useless. Do you make me happy like a game like this?

248
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,740
Let mom let mommy do all the work while

249
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,540
Fucking doing nothing

250
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:11,140
Egyptian higher verse system of numerals was represented by various everyday objects

251
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,940
I didn't realize we were going to actually learn in this game

252
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,900
I just wanted to play a cute puzzle game with my daughters. That's so much to ask like what the heck

253
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,980
Why am I looking at numbers?

254
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,140
History, right

255
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,060
Individual symbols are stacked together or form numbers their value is

256
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:32,020
Their values added as you can see in the following example one two three and four

257
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,860
Combine the same symbol when using more than one kind of symbol

258
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:46,660
It's 2 a.m. Please put it to rest count each symbol and multiply it with its value

259
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,380
to summon

260
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:57,620
Or reflins one a years are gonna have to just give us the code. What is 2 a.m. I'm not

261
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,380
What

262
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:09,220
What does that even mean so three and then like so that means 10

263
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,660
A dash is a one

264
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,740
Fuck what

265
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:21,940
What three thousand and um six and ten and whatever

266
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,860
It's so over it literally is

267
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,780
I open something here. I don't know what the fuck. Is there anything inside there?

268
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,940
I don't see anything. I also can't oh

269
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,940
Oh

270
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,940
vernaculars

271
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,940
Did you put it there?

272
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,940
Yeah

273
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,940
It's because you said it's you're like, oh, there's nothing there and I'm like, okay, I'll put some on there

274
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:57,060
Right reflins. Oh my god, right. Thank you. Someone just let us cheat. Thank you. I'm so sorry. There was absolutely no way in heck

275
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,140
I was getting that I would be up to ac

276
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,780
Unless you want to take a crack at it. So here you go. What is it? I'll put it right there. There you go

277
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,220
You take a crack. Let me see. I'll I'll just invest the game

278
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,580
Oh

279
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,380
Jesus

280
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,540
Um

281
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
Um

282
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,580
Forming numbers

283
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,140
Individual symbols are stacked to get up to form numbers

284
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,180
Okay

285
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,740
Um

286
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,500
That's why I cheated that's why I asked the reflins. Um

287
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,380
You definitely keep opening the book and look

288
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,500
Um

289
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,380
So we have

290
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,500
Uh

291
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,260
We have

292
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,260
1000

293
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,100
Uh-huh

294
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,100
We have

295
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
The

296
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,780
Three

297
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:29,300
Yes, yes, we have three thousand. Oh my god. No way you're doing it

298
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,940
You're great

299
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,020
Yeah, then we have

300
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,940
Uh

301
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,260
The

302
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,380
200

303
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:48,340
How many spiral ones like did we spiral ones for hypnosis?

304
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:57,700
Well, there's two at the bottom and then yes, we tally them together and two at the top

305
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,060
So there is

306
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
I don't know how to count four

307
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,260
Oh my god, that's so good. Okay, and I think you're actually gonna do this

308
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,460
I was like what I thought you left the call and I was like

309
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,380
Is the I'm I wish you can't count I'm done

310
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,700
No

311
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,140
um

312
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,140
and then

313
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,060
And then we have 10

314
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:49,700
And and then we have like the others two spirals, which is another 200

315
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,740
and then 10 and then

316
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:58,020
So 3400 and then there's two horseshoe ones

317
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,660
so that's two

318
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,180
And then it it ends it ends with

319
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,300
2000 like the

320
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,540
symbol that looks like a lady in a dress

321
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:19,140
That's a thousand. Yeah, so there's 3000 see how you tally up the thousands because there's three of the lady in a dress

322
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,820
And then me explaining that as if I didn't get the answer

323
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,060
Because I was too dumb to figure out myself. Um, and then there's four spirals

324
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:31,860
Which goes in the hundreds column and then in the tens column. There's two horseshoes

325
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,260
And then in the individual column, there's

326
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,420
3426

327
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,220
I don't

328
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,620
Oh

329
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,700
You actually did it on ironically though

330
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,340
You actually did it because I didn't get it

331
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,940
I mean, you're the one who calculated everything like I don't know what the actual numbers

332
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:02,420
To be honest with you. All right, so you did the calculating. I don't know what the fuck I was doing, but

333
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,860
Uh, okay something to put a key in

334
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,580
I'm going to put this key back here

335
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,380
I might be able to do

336
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,780
You actually

337
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,460
genius

338
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,980
Oh, it's what I think you're just because like you actually calculated all that's like

339
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,860
I do not I did not know like what the actual numbers are

340
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:30,420
Wait, oh, oh, what did we open? Oh, the new girls got me

341
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,220
Oh, it's a pyramid. Oh, we're making a pyramid to get the room

342
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,340
I see. Okay. So there's an extra pyramid part

343
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,860
And then there's so much coins. What do we do with them?

344
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,700
I have no fucking clue. Like what is the point?

345
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,420
What am I supposed to do with these coins? Hello? Wait, so do I offer them?

346
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,820
Oh

347
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,780
Well, actually, what do we do with this random dark? Oh

348
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,060
I just shove that in there. Oh

349
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,820
Wait, wait, I made it golden. Why? What the heck?

350
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,060
Oh, we can dig in this game

351
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,100
Why it says it's a key

352
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,060
I don't look like one

353
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:36,340
This thing says a key if there's no puzzle symbol, but say the name of an item is because it's not part of the puzzle

354
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:41,620
Speedrunning. Okay speedrunning. We're about to get the record

355
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,820
I don't know about that like I literally don't know what the fuck to do

356
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,820
Uh, how do we use the shovel?

357
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:56,420
It's apparently not part of the game if it has a

358
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,780
Key next to its name, then it's a part of it, but if it doesn't so then

359
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,100
We unlock all these coins for what? We put them in the water

360
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,780
Oh, wait, this is probably gonna

361
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,140
I just found it there

362
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,180
Right, we're washing the coins to offer why not

363
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,220
Okay

364
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:36,580
We literally have like two minutes left. We're fucking dying. We're we're gonna die

365
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:44,500
Wait, how did you find that hidden panel? Did you just touch the wall and it opened up? Is there more hidden panels?

366
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:51,540
Uh, I don't see anymore. Like that was like a sign of like a hand or something like that and that's

367
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,820
What I collect

368
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:04,020
Is there two minutes in this audio? We're bro, we got stuck on the tutorial like it is so hard for no reason

369
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,260
Okay, give me nothing

370
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:19,860
So I feel like we're just wait what the waves mean the waves don't even mean anything

371
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,780
Is that put it back that put it in the water? No

372
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:32,660
I don't think putting it in the water. Oh goodness. Why does he need a bath? Who or what did what did that do?

373
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,740
Oh

374
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:41,700
Why did we have to give him a bath off his mistake it worked. Oh, okay

375
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,780
Okay

376
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,860
Not me losing my fucking frames

377
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,660
Are you? Oh, no

378
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:02,580
Oh great more fucking puzzles wait, why aren't these easy? I thought this game was like accessible

379
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,460
What even is this

380
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:11,060
We're literally about to die like how much time do we have? No

381
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:22,020
Both of us low turn into the timer being like, yeah, we have a time. Um, oh my god

382
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:36,100
The bird right wait, okay, we enter the maze

383
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,180
And we touch a lion

384
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:45,460
Uh house a square and a cactus on the wheel. What the heck?

385
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,260
A lion

386
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,580
Uh a house. Oh

387
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,980
Nothing happened the timer is up, but like we're

388
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:05,140
Fine, it's for an achievement. I thought it meant you died. Oh, okay. That was actually rather easy. Okay. We'll figure that one out

389
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,820
Sorry, what do we do? Oh, is that the

390
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,540
No

391
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,780
Another one

392
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,260
A what

393
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,980
How do you do these

394
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:30,260
Wait, do we have to start with a particular one? Is it not telling us what to start? Maybe maybe the bird maybe start

395
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,580
Can you start with the bird?

396
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,700
I don't see a bird in the map

397
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,420
Wait, it's maybe it's the only ones that can reach the center

398
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,500
Uh

399
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,980
Okay, the beetle can't reach the center

400
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,140
The wasp can

401
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,940
I'm supposed to read that bird. Oh my god

402
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,740
Oh

403
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,740
I just come open and your legs are spread behind me. I'm like, uh, oh

404
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,180
Can I help you?

405
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:24,500
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I nearly died. This game was a mistake. I'm so sorry

406
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:31,140
I keep I'm like, oh these puzzle games. They look so easy and accessible and then we go play them

407
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,700
And it's like asking for so much like oh my god. It's

408
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,020
It's too much. We can't even do that. Oh wait, look

409
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,500
I have I have cheat. Oh my god. Yes. I love cheat

410
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,060
That's the only thing I'm good for for clicking on the cheat button

411
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:58,580
It's the the base wink wink the base. Here you go

412
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,140
So then what does that change? Uh

413
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,580
What's the change right? I need this foot clearly the eye

414
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,820

415
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:22,100
Wow, the beetle is a beetle. Wow. The bee is a bee

416
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,500
Oh, wow

417
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:30,180
That means water that symbol in front of this thing meant water by the way. I just figured out because I opened this book

418
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,900
Okay, okay

419
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,900

Uh

421
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,460
It's so boring even

422
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,460
Why are we trying to write?

423
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,220
Okay, I think we have the book I get I trust you. Yeah, what even is this?

424
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:52,340
What are we even like trying to do in this puzzle? I'm just looking through the symbols and looking for the best

425
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,380
I

426
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,380

00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,860
I'm pressing the button

429
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,620
The bee can make it. Yeah, I know the bee can make it. But what is that?

430
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,580
What is that? What do we do with the bee making it?

431
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,900
A different symbol the thing I'm trying to understand like what are these three

432
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:26,820
Like what are we trying to achieve? I don't know. This is the worst part

433
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,100
Like I don't understand

434
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,100
What were the bees?

435
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,700
What?

436
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,700
Right

437
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,700
So

I mean it's not bad honestly

487
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,700
Come on me. Let me restart it

Oh, okay

00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:20,260
Have we been trolled is this like an impossible puzzle how did you get into the same answer?

493
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,940
Uh

494
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,220
I

495
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:34,660
Feel like is this a troll puzzle and it can't be done and we're like wasting our time on it

496
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,020
Imagine another ring like

00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,780
He says it needs to be lit up it may oh

498
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,620
I'll go explore the room a bit more

499
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,700
Apparently we're not supposed to do what we think we're trying to do

500
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:58,660
What do you mean, but that's supposed to do this puzzle then and we're not supposed to light up

501
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,300
We're supposed to make an image of something. I don't know what

502
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,380
Ha, bro. We would I'm not gonna lie. We probably would mean oh

00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,300
Where is uh, where's the heart?

536
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,100
It's in that red jar on the floor

537
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:48,100
Oh, it's a weight puzzle. Oh, I like weight puzzles. Hold on a minute. Oh, hold on a minute. Just put my fat ass

538
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,060
Oh my god, I'm real

539
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,780
Okay, so the wiggly worm

541
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,900
No, head five is heavier than the wiggly. Oh, look

542
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:07,940
Oh, he wants some I don't know what he wants. Maybe put your butt cheek on where his hand is

543
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:14,340
That's called a piece the egyptian gods. I'll put there is a note on the floor. I'll put it in front of me. Okay

544
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,060
Oh

545
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:22,180
Oh, okay, that's equal. So this is worth two and then we take this one

546
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,980
Put it back. Oh

547
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,300
Snake is heavier

548
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,620
Look, I I was able to give him the thing

549
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:36,980
What did you give him the heart thing? Oh, and his hand moved lower

550
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:43,380
But he I guess he needs another thing. Which is this we have the baboon head. Oh, no, he doesn't want to

551
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:48,100
What is the thing like the second thing here? Does he want this?

552
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,580
You want a crowbar?

553
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,460
Nope, hold on. Oh

554
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,860
So it has to be four

555
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,700
Okay, it's worth four because

556
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,340
By a process of elimination

557
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,940
I have three fours and then we just need the bird

558
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:34,020
That bowl is heavier than two but heavier than three heavier than eight

559
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,900
Man none of these haven't

560
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,860
They break them

561
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:49,620
Oh my god, okay, I actually enjoyed that puzzle sorry about that. I said what I said I enjoyed that puzzle

00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:01,860
Right, so we have the oh wait, we have all the heads. Where do we put them?

565
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:05,060
I'm not sure

566
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:11,780
On top of the jars. Oh idiot. Oh my god. Oh, that's what the note is. Where's that note?

567
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,060
It's that something about the north

568
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,620
And

569
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,620
If you've got that note, we'll know what these are

570
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,700
North

571
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:34,180
You have the note. Oh wait, sorry. It's still on the floor. Hold on. I get it. Okay. The lungs are north. Hold on right

00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,540
Oh, no, no, it's not

00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:50,420
That was a brain or something. Okay that one goes there

577
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:54,020
And then open it up

578
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:55,780
and then

579
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:59,860
The stomach is on the south. Okay, right and then we just need to put the heads on the thing

580
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,540
The baboon we know the baboon head is north

581
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,260
The baboon head is north. Okay

582
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,020
And then where's the birdie?

583
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,180
The jackal headed east

584
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,660
And then

585
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,860

Oh, I could give it to him. Oh, that'll be what he wants. Oh, yeah

607
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:12,340
Oh, wait, why is someone so much faster than the freaking tutorial?

608
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,140
That was so fast

609
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:22,420
Okay, we actually did this one. I don't did we dare for another that went so quickly compared to other ones? Let's try. Let's

610
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:26,100
Okay, let's try. Let's see. This one was more

611
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:31,620
That was great doable. Yeah, that was pretty easy and obvious whereas the other ones were like

612
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:36,180
Good luck and finding what you need and it's like, uh, okay. Thanks. I guess like

613
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,100
Yeah

614
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:40,100
Could you figure it out?

615
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:45,860
Right, right. Let's let's hope this isn't gonna be a repeat of the tutorial. We're gonna be dead drag

616
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,020
Okay, what's in the chest?

617
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,980
Oh

618
00:53:55,620 --> 00:54:01,380
No, all right. Okay. Hold on. Let's just first analyze the the location. We need to use her. Oh

619
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,100
Uh, the anubis

620
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:07,780
Can you see this lever? Can you put it on like this? Oh

621
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,420
How could you do that so quickly?

622
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,380
I broke it. I wonder if that's the key

623
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,660
No, it's not

624
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:21,300
That's the key. Hmm. That's not can you pull this lever all the way down and hold it?

625
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:26,180
Which one this one just hold on. We don't just keep yeah

626
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,340
We're doing it. Oh my god. Wait, why is that?

627
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:37,060
Like, okay, we're just not we're doing so good

628
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,260
Oh, maybe we need to melt this

629
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:44,740
Oh

630
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,660
Maybe

631
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,140
Maybe some of these

632
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,380
I

633
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:03,780
Okay, but as much as you're like, oh, I'm only smashing things it actually helps because things come out of the stuff

634
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:12,100
I'm having the time of my life just smashing everything in this room. That's what I'm good

635
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,500
Oh

Oh, there's the baby. There's three gems. Hold on. There's three red gems. There's five

671
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:03,700
A pig and then two blue ones and then that's that one. Oh my god, we're speaking

672
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,140
Let's go

673
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:14,100
Is that is it one more item?

674
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:18,660
Whatever in this trip right had to open this one. I thought we put all of them

675
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,380
I think there's one more

676
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:28,740
How do I open this chest? Oh, I don't know. Oh wait. Wait this key movie gets used in it as well

677
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:31,060
Oh

678
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:35,300
What? Oh, no, it doesn't oh right. I thought I was gonna let me use the same key twice

679
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:40,580
These are came out. I wish literally this one's a tutorial harder than

680
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:47,060
Um, but we've interacted with everything on the walls and stuff

681
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:59,860
Why don't we do with this pyramids that was the puzzle for how much how many blobs were inside the thing

682
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,500
Uh

683
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:12,740
Um, I'm I think I can't figure out what we need to do to open this chest. There's nothing on it

684
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,620
Um

685
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:22,660
As you go in same and then hit in the hint button as well turn it around with the sheet. What do we need there?

686
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,260
There's a compartment underneath

687
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:35,060
What that was the key underneath? What? Oh my god

688
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,980
Oh my god

689
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:46,180
Wait, what that's done. Oh shit. Oh my god. It's just calm. Oh

690
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:54,740
It's gonna be like behold the gold is flowing into the lands of Egypt. I say look at the calm

691
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:00,580
Oh my god, wait, why is it getting so much easier? What's going on?

692
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:04,500
Everything is easier. Meanwhile, I can't do like

693
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:13,780
And you do like all of them. Okay. I won't I won't make you play anymore. I won't make you play anymore. Um

694
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,260
That

695
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:18,100
Honestly, that was an all right game

696
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:23,140
I didn't I have to admit when you can't even figure out what you need to do. It's like bra

697
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,620
Help us please

698
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:29,620
But like that would I don't know if some of it's starting to visually get a lot easier

699
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:31,620
Did they like purposefully?

700
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:37,460
I don't know. I see getting princess carried and it was my pleasure. I see

701
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:42,580
Real the princess carry is my pleasure. Um

702
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:47,220
Under the chest would have taken forever if we didn't use the hint

703
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:52,980
Honestly, I would not spot that. I'm not even kidding. I was like we've interacted with everything on the wall and stuff. So

704
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,660
Yeah, um, I

705
01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:05,380
I'm gonna thank you. I see for collabing with me. Um, I am gonna do a wee bit more of zatsu

706
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:06,740
Um

707
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:12,020
On my own to complain about this game, but thank you so much for having me. I seen snowberries. That was lovely

708
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,580
We got there in the end. We got there in the end

709
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:21,700
Him right. I will jump out the call and then I'll disconnect the little vtuber thing, but thank you so so much

710
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,500
I love you. I'll talk to you later. Okay. Bye

711
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,660
I

712
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:34,100
That's favorite thing is when you end a collab and they're just sitting in the

713
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,900
Hold on hold on

714
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:45,780
That honestly that honestly, oh shit everything and it all just fades too

715
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,900
Okay, I know this isn't my usual steam stream time

716
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:57,860
But we did it. We actually did it. That wasn't that horrific that could have been worse that could have been

717
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:01,060
A heck of a lot worse. I'm not even kidding

718
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:08,020
But I enjoyed that. I started to click at the end there. Um, I don't know if I used to enjoy that

719
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:15,300
I'm like, I need to stop picking puzzle games. Let's stop picking puzzle games. It's absolutely killing my gen mates

720
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:19,860
Um next time choose another a different type no more puzzle

721
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:25,140
Literally, I forced Azur to do a puzzle game with me. I forced Marisa to do a puzzle game with me

722
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:27,220
And then I do what I say. I'm like brah

723
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,500
I need to start. I need to switch things up

724
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,580
Because I've got Emmy and she be on the way soon tm

725
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:39,380
And the game I had picked out for she be is a freaking puzzle game

726
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,780
um

727
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:48,580
Because she be was like, oh, I've never played um portal 2 and I'm like, you've never played portal 2

728
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,220
Please play portal 2 with me. I love it

729
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:53,460
Uh

730
01:03:53,460 --> 01:04:00,260
You don't like puzzles on your gen makes like puzzles. Why do you keep doing this? I actually don't mind puzzle games. I just suck

731
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:05,700
Um, but yeah, apparently portal 2 is fun to oh, she was like, I've not played I'm like

732
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:08,340
What do you mean you've not played portal 2?

733
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:13,300
Like what would you mean and I'm like brah oops all puzzles

734
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:17,380
Literally, I'm like, well might as well keep up the streak now because if I'm gonna do a puzzle

735
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:19,380
I might as well do a puzzle with Emmy

736
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:25,300
Um, okay portal 2 is different. That's a fun path that your gen mates do need more stimulation in their brain

737
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:28,500
Bruh, I'm not even kidding. I got added onto it. So

738
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,220
I see tweeted that she's streaming with me

739
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,940
and then a freaking um

740
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:40,340
A snow very fucking ass and goes don't forget to set your target, but I'm like I say oh, what does this mean?

741
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,500
Hmm

742
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,980
Watch looking forward to you playing the witness

743
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:54,340
Wait, you've never no I've played portal 2 she be told me she's never played portal 2 and I'm like brah get me on it

744
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:56,340
Let me be your first

745
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:58,340
um

746
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:00,340
So I'm gonna message her

747
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:04,740
And see if she's um, okay. The only problem is

748
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:08,020
um

749
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:12,740
Portal 2 and 1 sit and takes five hours. There is no

750
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:17,620
Way I can ask she be to sit with me for five hours

751
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:21,300
So it may be two hours the first stream and then two hours the next one like two and a half

752
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:25,140
Mummy teaching her daughters how to play puzzles one at a time

753
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:28,420
I mean kind of because I'm familiar with all the games I've picked

754
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:31,380
It's just been a very long time. So I've forgotten everything

755
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:33,140
Um

756
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:38,100
The witness gave me a headache. Oh, no, I don't want to give because it would be in me that would play the witness

757
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:41,940
Surely there's

758
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:46,020
Being her first in portal 2 bags am her first

759
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,740
bags am her first

760
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:55,140
The portal to multiplayer does have some test level segments. So it's not

761
01:05:55,780 --> 01:06:01,460
One long thing. Yeah, the witness is a solo game. Oh, you want me to play a solo

762
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:04,740
Puzzle game now hold on a minute

763
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:09,940
That's getting a bit outrageous with these these behaviors. That's outrageous. You can't do that. You can't do this to me

764
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:15,940
Literally green goblin. You can't do this to me expect to me to play a puzzle game on my own

765
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:20,020
And you don't give me any just any club is just play Minecraft

766
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:23,060
I think we're actually gonna get a Minecraft server at one point

767
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:29,300
Originally it was supposed to be this month, but as always things get delayed and there's plans and the works and that I'm

768
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:36,580
Like that. Um, I have a fantastic announcement for clippers. I finally did it yesterday

769
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:40,820
I wrote out the terms and conditions if you want to be a veiler

770
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:47,940
Established clipper. Um, and we're gonna see what happens if people apply or not or

771
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:55,300
If we go to bed, I'm so sorry. I'm not normally awake right now. I'm right now. I am

772
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:00,900
Gimli is um currently well

773
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:06,260
Normally when I sleep for gimli is like a heat seeking missile, okay?

774
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:08,820
And I am warmest at my crotch

775
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:12,900
So gimli is attached to my crotch whenever I lie down

776
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:17,220
Um, like cats are just heat seeking missiles. Honestly

777
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:19,380
um

778
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:23,300
I twitch a lot so vego doesn't like to sleep next to me. Um

779
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,740
Nah, strawney a Hongshuo

780
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:28,740
ah

781
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,740
I'm not like a

782
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:37,540
Um, my mum my mum used to say I was quite a freaky super in terms of like

783
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:40,020
ah

784
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:45,220
I'm like a jiggle about a lot and I grained my teeth in my sleep apparently

785
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:52,900
Like I should probably get like one of them plastic protectors to sleep with I had them somewhere but I lost them

786
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:58,180
Gimli just like me for real for real attached to the the hip

787
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,660
um

788
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,660
Attached to the groin honestly

789
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:06,260
I request to treat places with gimli immediately vealers

790
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:12,020
Those are I don't know who the sleepyhead of ealers. I think obviously if I go

791
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:17,540
Yeah, I woke up at 2 a.m. For this collab literally no one's gonna be like. Oh my god

792
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:19,460
strawney

793
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:23,060
You know like Dennis said I grained in my sleep. I needed that

794
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:26,420
I'm

795
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:32,500
Wait, do you mean grained as in like the night if I like you grained work, you know what one you're done two

796
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:36,580
You're done. Okay, strawney. No lie. My parents once described me as breakdowns into my sleep

797
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:42,020
My gran I had a sleepover with my gran and I woke up and I was like

798
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:45,940
Uh, like I shared the bed with her in that and I woke up and I was like

799
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:52,740
I'm shattered. I don't feel like I slept at all and she she turns around you. She's like strawney

800
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:57,780
You literally woke up like a demon in the middle of your sleep like you she said

801
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:03,620
Apparently I sat up and like in the middle of my sleep at like 2 a.m. The morning possessed

802
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:05,620
um

803
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:13,140
And my eyes were wide open and then I've I've fell back asleep again type thing. Um, so yeah, um

804
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:19,620
If if you're wanting to sleep with me reflin, just be warned. Apparently I do a lot of freaky stuff. So

805
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:22,420
You know, just be careful

806
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:25,380
There I might do something freaky with you

807
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:32,100
No, my mum's always made a comment about how I sleep as well. So

808
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:35,380
I'll most just be up your bow

809
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,500
I'll look at marshmallow

810
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:45,380
First marshmallow. Mummy. I gave myself blue balls. Okay. Maybe we don't read marshmallows. Maybe we read them another time

811
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:49,860
I actually thought about what I wanted to do from my first bandsly stream

812
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:53,160
Um, and it's absolutely deplorable

813
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:56,900
But I want to play the coffin of andy and lay lay

814
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:01,140
And enjoy it and it's full glory

815
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:04,820
Aim and what happens happens

816
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,100
That was my first one

817
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,500
Aim, that's my first idea

818
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:14,740
I don't I'm not gonna promise that anything happens afterwards

819
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:22,660
But all I'm gonna say is that's my number one. I'm like I'm like a hundred percent sure that's my number one

820
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:25,700
Aim interest

821
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:30,340
Okay, so I wanted to play it and then we can all comedically

822
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:33,620
afterwards

823
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:35,780
um

824
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:37,460
We go for the only

825
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:40,260
There's only one ending as far as I'm aware in that game

826
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:47,140
Then and oh my god, acy showed me this commission. She's been teasing a commission to the snowberries on twitter

827
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,140
and

828
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:54,980
She showed me the update and oh my god snowberries are in for a treat. She's so good at picking out that stuff

829
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:57,860
um

830
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:10,980
Uh, sorry

831
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:16,820
Yeah, if you didn't know what the big massive update is emmy got a freaking stripe because her rat sniffed

832
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,940
a

833
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:22,820
Um

834
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:30,580
Um rim rimmy. Oh my god. No, there's no rimming at all going on. I assure you. Sorry, right

835
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:36,660
I'm gonna stop looking at discord for it because this is what happens when emmy's rat

836
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,380
okay, um

837
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:43,940
emmy's rat came on the mic. It was probably estaban

838
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:46,580
in

839
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:47,940
and

840
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:52,340
Sniffed in the mic and youtube was like banable. That's that's popcorn

841
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,820
um, and I'm like

842
01:11:54,820 --> 01:12:01,300
No, so we're asking youtube to undo it because she is like she can't interact with the account for a week

843
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:07,780
Like can't do anything can't submit this can't get the strike removed can't stream can't upload videos

844
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:11,700
Can't do a thing on youtube and that's literally her income source and I'm like

845
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:17,380
You need to relax, okay two rats were on the mic

846
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:20,740
spitting down the beat

847
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:26,900
She made that joke before her signature move would be a rim job. What wait, why did she come up with that?

848
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:29,700
What happened? What about me missing?

849
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:33,380
Came on the mic. It came on the mic. It went on the mic

850
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:40,660
Oh, do you not use sentences like that? Honestly, it's a little bit. Seriously, youtube has to fix their thoughts

851
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:45,220
Bro, I literally if you go on twitter and see the ridiculousness

852
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:49,940
You can literally hear her walk over to the cage bring the rat over then the little rat's like

853
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:53,780
Okay, I don't know what noises rats make but I was like

854
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:56,660
um

855
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:58,100
and it's like

856
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:03,620
They couldn't even say that the ear licking was wrong or when she was literally chomping on the ears

857
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:07,220
But then the rat the rat no get over here. I'm gonna have that

858
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:10,180
Um, absolutely no, haven't it

859
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,860
Um

860
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:21,780
Well done youtube keeping kids safe from rats sniffing the mic ASMR. Honestly. She posted the moment

861
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:26,100
Yeah, like the timestamp was messed up like the timestamp for my booty clap

862
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:30,100
No, sorry my round of applause ASMR audio

863
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:35,540
Em was me breathing in the mic like in the ear. Um

864
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:41,140
Strony the joke her rats came on the mic. What the rest?

865
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:52,420
I never uploaded big clap ASMR. You can't prove it. That was clear. No, the truth hasn't come out. Put it back inside right now

866
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:55,060
um, that was

867
01:13:55,620 --> 01:14:00,420
ASMR clapping with my hands ASMR with my hands. Let's see

868
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:05,300
That's my hands. That was me spanking my back

869
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:08,260
um

870
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:11,860
But yes, um, I finally put up the schedule for this week as well

871
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:16,100
And I know I should probably be using a background right now and background music

872
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:18,100
But you just have my raw vocals

873
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:22,820
And it's a very short stream today. I do apologize

874
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:26,820
And clearly the claps are from jumping jacks. Honestly

875
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:30,500
Do you do jumping jacks on the D?

876
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:33,940
Anyway, um

877
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:40,820
Clap them with our hands without our hands. Exactly. You have some powerful hands looking forward to the celebration stream

878
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:49,220
The the psych the psychoping one. I'm excited for it too. I just hope I can set up the camera a bit better

879
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:52,740
But unfortunately I'm like really limited in the angles

880
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:59,540
I can like do stuff without like the risk of the the camera dropping because I'm going to be honest. Um

881
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,620
I'm cutting my hair. Um in the in the

882
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:10,740
In the microphone soon for sound effects. Um because I need more hair cutting ASMR sound effects

883
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:15,780
I'm going to come out of that recording booth looking like a fucking turnip. I'm not even kidding

884
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:20,340
Um, don't drop us. I have to be somewhat of a booty expert. Oh, yeah

885
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:27,060
Um, show us some big hands to make this sound. I literally I should play basketball

886
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:30,740
I have big enemy hands. Um

887
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:34,420
But yeah

888
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:36,980
Um

889
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:40,820
Also, we reached 20,000 subscribers. I don't know that's kind of base

890
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:46,340
Kind of base. So thank you everyone who's like like subscribed hung out lurked in the shadows

891
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:52,980
Um, that's incredibly kind of you. Um, the reward and quotation marks or the celebrate

892
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:56,340
celebrate your story stream is

893
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:59,060
um one hour of

894
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:07,300
Workout on ring fit ASMR and then I will take the microphone into the shower with me

895
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:09,860
um

896
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:11,460
Uh

897
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:13,780
And we'll have a shower together as well

898
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:21,860
But it's somehow going to be ASMR, but I need to turn I'll definitely test out the microphone and stuff this time because the bathtub

899
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:26,340
I'm so upset the bathtub thing. I'm going to die again. No one hour

900
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:32,420
Of ring fit basically. I mean do like what 45 minutes and bring you into the shower and then

901
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:38,660
No pheromone max please. No, I need to do this shower gonna heart rate one or yeah, I'll do the heart rate one

902
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:41,220
um

903
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:47,060
Make sure it's not extremely difficult. Yes, I will lower the the settings or whatever, but yes, we're going to do

904
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:53,140
That where we did a little shower and stuff. I don't know if acce is gonna keep yapping

905
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:54,900
um

906
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:58,980
If acce keeps yapping I might actually redirect entire and then I'll get ready for my

907
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:02,260
Does it feel like

908
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:04,420
Are

909
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:08,660
I'm gonna end this stream. Oh fuck. I'm gonna see you again tomorrow

910
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:11,620
At the same time

911
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:17,780
I'm gonna redirect into acce. She's yapping a bit. Uh, anyway, I'm ending stream

912
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:21,940
Little sleepy acce. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll wrap it up. Wrap it up

913
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:26,420
Um, I'll see if there's someone else on that can redirect into because I don't think she

914
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:30,020
Sheepsters may be

915
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,700
strumming later

916
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:36,900
Um, I do have a membership hercules watch long. I'm gonna get a little sued in the couple

917
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:40,660
Um

918
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:52,180
Wait what

919
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:58,820
She be streams in four hours. Oh, there's no way I'm sending right. Okay. I'll just I'll redirect into someone. That's why

920
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:01,620
that ain't me

921
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:02,900
um

922
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:09,780
Nanny is streaming. I'll uh redirect into nanny because she was nice to me as soon as nanny was nice to me. I'm like, oh my god

923
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:11,780
I love you. Thanks for being nice to me

924
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:14,900
um

925
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:18,900
She hasn't waited 4.7 hours is a diabolical way, so yeah

926
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:28,500
But uh redirected to nanny. Oh my god. Did you hear the news uh about that gen 2 hololiver reason?

927
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:31,620
Oh my god. She had such a fantastic run

928
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,900
Anyway, sorry. That was just general

929
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,460
That was just general. Um

930
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:45,220
Take care. Um, what I'm going to do is I'm going to redirect into nanny. Okay. Watch me whip. Watch me

931
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:49,300
Um, and then I am going to

932
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:54,580
Make a cup of tea and get some food and then for those of you who are members

933
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:56,900
We'll do a members watch along

934
01:18:56,980 --> 01:19:00,100
Um, again, I do apologize for the different start of time

935
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:05,460
I wasn't gonna make icy randomly wait 2 extra hours just to stream on mad time

936
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:09,700
So I'd rather make it as easy as possible for the girls to like so then we can be like, yep

937
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:15,620
Well collab and the girls are also planning collabs among each other

938
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,180
um

939
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:20,900
But yes, um a lot of collabs are coming

940
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:24,820
For me anyway, I'm trying to be a bit more social. Um

941
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:30,100
I'm a bit I'm a bit of a I get like so zoomed in on work that I don't have time to

942
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,780
kind of

943
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:34,500
You know burst out the bubble, but I my goal is

944
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:42,900
Hopefully by the end of this month. I'll have streamed at least with everyone in violour and then at least with a couple of other folk as well

945
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:45,700
I have another collab that I might be able to say up

946
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:49,460
If the girls want me

947
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,100
I don't know

948
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:54,340
You mean hunky leaves

949
01:19:54,660 --> 01:20:00,980
Still a fun stream. I don't really enjoy. I don't know. I got I got a serotonin boost when I figured that out instantly

950
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:02,660
What I needed to do

951
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:07,540
But it was really annoying just standing about being like what an error that we need to do like it's not obvious

952
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:15,300
Um, but yes, I I'm gonna go offline. I will see you tomorrow. Um, and if I don't see you through the week

953
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:18,580
I'll see you through the window or something like that that used to be a burst then I can't remember

954
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:20,420
Um

955
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:22,420
Tomorrow we're doing

956
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:29,460
Answering questions. You are too afraid to ask. Oh my god. I was delirious when I put up all these rooms by the way

957
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:34,980
Everything was spelled horrifically wrong. Like I spelt my community posts wrong

958
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:39,460
I spelt I was spelling everything wrong. I was delirious when I put up all these weight rooms

959
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:45,380
So I I do apologize if you're like, uh, why is everything so messed up?

960
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:48,340
And because I'm dumb

961
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:56,420
Um, what kind of questions do you anticipate? So I oh, yeah, we also have the 15k celebrations. I can later on

962
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:03,300
Um, what's different than usual honestly though, but like something I messed up

963
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:09,860
It was in the community post and I put the wrong like can is it connective or whatever the word is

964
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:12,180
and it was like

965
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:17,140
Uh, I was like this week is a smaller length of streams, but that doesn't take away from how much fun

966
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:22,420
I have spending every last moment from you and I was like from you

967
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:24,180
It's with you

968
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:29,620
And I was like, oh my god, the reflosers are gonna throw up if they read that so I had to change it really quickly

969
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:34,260
I'm like, oh my god, they're gonna project a vomit if it makes it sound like I'm like trying to be away from them

970
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:36,260
What the fuck what the fuck

971
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:40,980
All right. No, I do like you. That's my stream every single day

972
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:44,820
I'll the only time I get pieces when I'm with you

973
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:51,060
Um, she hates I know I'm done. I'm just really dumb and small-brained

974
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:54,980
Um, but yes tomorrow is a zatsu type stream

975
01:21:55,460 --> 01:22:02,580
I'm I'm slowly testing zatsu in terms of having like a mission objective and then doing it

976
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:09,860
So I'm gonna answer questions like how are bridges built because you're obviously too afraid to ask

977
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:15,220
You only like it when we give you money stop. I will literally cry people genuinely think that

978
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:21,140
Um, I was gonna answer questions like oh, how are bridges built or like why do onions make humans cry?

979
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:25,620
Like they also make cats cry like mammals and that so like let's take a look into it

980
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:29,540
I was gonna do like giffy questions like that where it's like, oh, that's how you get like

981
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:32,580
I only realized that you know the little

982
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,700
Water on the side of the street

983
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:38,980
I always say this because it's so mind-blowing to me

984
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:44,180
I used to be like, oh, there's like loads of random water puddles on the side of the street

985
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:48,660
Yeah, that isn't water. It's dog piss like it never occurred to me that that's dog pee

986
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:52,980
Um, for some reason. I just thought it randomly rained or something leaked

987
01:22:53,460 --> 01:23:00,500
Like from a pipe or something on the side like I on the pavement. I don't know why it took me years to figure that out

988
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:05,220
I like it doesn't taste like I didn't taste

989
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:10,340
Um, it's something in the root part if you don't cut it you don't have any tears

990
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:13,380
See, well, we're gonna discover it tomorrow

991
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:20,100
But if you guys have any giffy questions you want to ask in marshmallow, I'm all ears. I will happily answer. I'm all ears

992
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:26,580
Um, real life streamer rain. Hi mommy. I'm sorry. No, don't be sorry. As I said, this was an awkward stream time

993
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:33,140
Um, I am gonna get prepared for the member stream. Um, I don't know how many

994
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:36,820
Music so many songs are recognized, but

995
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:41,060
Um, yeah nice kind of easy week

996
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:48,260
Nice general week on me. Um, the veal or clipping program is getting announced today. I did the work yesterday

997
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:54,900
Now I need the website to be updated because I don't handle that stuff. That's management that deals with that. Um

998
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:59,300
So once the website's updated the

999
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:02,180
Twitter the veal or twitter

1000
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:03,860
will have

1001
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:05,140
a

1002
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:12,260
Advertising post and then I'll get the girls to repeat it. Then we'll see what people's reactions are

1003
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:16,260
I mean, I think it's fair if you get one viral clip you get

1004
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:20,820
210 bucks from it. So I think it's yeah, but that's just me

1005
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:26,420
I'm trying to be as fair as possible and I'm trying to, you know, get garr gather in Torre

1006
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:29,940
How about advice questions? I need some advice. I'll change my life

1007
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:35,620
I'm not sure I have it every single song gonna be bombarded with questions. How cute and lovely you are

1008
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:42,980
Oh my god, my marshmallows got so inkable yesterday. I was like, what happened? Why did we both get so

1009
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:45,940
You know

1010
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:48,820
Um, is lava a solid or a liquid?

1011
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:53,780
Oh, I like that question. I would say it's a solid

1012
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:58,340
But maybe it is a liquid

1013
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:00,020
I don't know

1014
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:04,660
Well, did you know but the clip the clips the um

1015
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:10,420
One question doesn't clap absolutely any day of the week. I do it right now, but

1016
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:13,700
It's an exposed me

1017
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:15,780
So I can't do it right now

1018
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:22,580
Um, gotta give my me some material for stress relief. Honestly though, I think I'll probably I'm not gonna lie

1019
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:27,140
There's probably gonna be an all audio after I post the photos because if you guys send me audios of you

1020
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:30,180
I'm gonna go feral. I'm gonna be

1021
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:36,020
Nam a liquid I say I would say a liquid. I it does flow like a liquid

1022
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:41,940
I suppose lava liquid, but magma solid. Yeah

1023
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:43,940
Yeah

1024
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:51,700
Paying the I'm preparing the material as we speak honestly the golem side take over her

1025
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:56,100
If I can drink it it's liquid

1026
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:02,820
I hope you're not drinking liquid in lava in your free time getting ready

1027
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:09,780
Bro, I'm so excited to do it. I'm so excited to be such a fucking tease. I love being a little tease

1028
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:12,340
I don't know why I find it so satisfying

1029
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:13,940
I find it

1030
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:20,740
There's something that activates all my neurons of like, yeah, you can't stop yourself from inking into this

1031
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:23,540
Oh, I've already got the oil ready for the picture

1032
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:26,900
Got my little thigh

1033
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:32,660

Okay, I'm gonna love you. I leave you and I'll see. Oh, good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon. By the way

1037
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:47,220

01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:48,420
