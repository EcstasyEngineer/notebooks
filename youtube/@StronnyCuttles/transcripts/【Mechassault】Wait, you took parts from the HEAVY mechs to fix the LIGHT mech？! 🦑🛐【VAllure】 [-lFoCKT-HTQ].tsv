0	2000	Okay.
8000	12000	Focus on your life so you can let your dreams come back to you.
12000	14000	No, I don't want to play any more.
16000	18000	Go back real.
22000	24000	Save your dreams.
24000	29000	It took 1,000 years to perfect the battle machine.
30000	34000	But it's only a second to pull the trigger.
43000	45000	Good morning.
45000	48000	Last morning, you got the Atlantic Sea?
48000	50000	You don't watch the sea?
50000	52000	You don't watch the sea?
52000	54000	Yeah.
66000	68000	Well...
69000	72000	Sorry, game's still out, game's still out.
72000	74000	Return back to the...
74000	76000	To what? To speak?
76000	79000	Oh my god. Make phones in my arms.
82000	84000	Okay. Well good morning.
84000	86000	Good evening. Good afternoon.
86000	88000	Have fantastic news.
88000	90000	I slept.
90000	92000	Oh my god.
92000	94000	I slept.
94000	98000	The fucking Christmas party.
98000	100000	Uh...
100000	102000	I also...
102000	104000	Also give him an animal.
104000	106000	Give him an animal. Oh.
106000	110000	So now I no longer have the belly of someone that has 5 days old.
110000	112000	Uh...
112000	114000	Shit.
114000	116000	Basically...
116000	118000	Can we finish the Yumi camp?
118000	120000	Sorry, this was a disgusting thing I could probably ever see.
120000	122000	And it's first thing in the morning.
122000	124000	Um...
124000	126000	Basically started after the Yumi...
126000	128000	Um...
128000	130000	Oh yeah. Oh no, this can't be.
130000	132000	Put me on easy. Come on.
132000	134000	Current levels. Suffer the silence.
136000	138000	I can't pick anything else.
138000	140000	Oh no.
140000	142000	Oh no, this can't be.
142000	144000	Creatin' you? Oh no.
146000	148000	We can only pick make warrior.
148000	150000	We have to do normal difficulty.
150000	152000	We can't just do camp.
152000	154000	Right, anyway.
154000	156000	Very quickly summarized what happened.
156000	158000	After the fantastic Yumi plus collab,
158000	160000	which was an absolute hoot and holler,
160000	162000	turns out we all love each other.
162000	164000	Um...
164000	166000	I basically passed out
166000	168000	for six hours.
168000	170000	And then I woke up and I was like...
170000	172000	Ugh, my stomach, my stomach.
172000	174000	Ugh, I can't do this anymore.
174000	176000	So I give him an innermot
176000	178000	and I did that.
178000	180000	And I ended up...
180000	182000	I ended up passing out
182000	184000	again after that.
184000	186000	And I woke up with five minutes to go.
186000	188000	So all in all,
188000	190000	I ended up sleeping 12 hours.
190000	192000	I woke up with a massive headache.
192000	194000	That's not gonna stop me. I'm taking painkillers.
194000	196000	Turns out I am...
196000	198000	I freaking...
198000	200000	But I accidentally hydrate
200000	202000	via my fucking ass.
202000	204000	Because it didn't come out at first.
204000	206000	And I was like, excuse me?
206000	208000	Water? Where did you go?
208000	210000	Hmm...
210000	212000	Um, so that was actually taking room.
212000	214000	No.
216000	218000	Uh...
218000	220000	The good news is...
220000	222000	We're playing...
222000	224000	It's technically a childhood game,
224000	226000	but I was actually too weak
226000	228000	to play this at any point.
228000	230000	So I know of,
230000	232000	you know, all the mech
232000	234000	types and all of that.
234000	236000	Because I watched my dad play this game, basically.
236000	238000	So I don't even know if we're gonna successfully
238000	240000	get through it, but it doesn't matter.
240000	242000	Because we're gonna try our best.
242000	244000	I do have a ASMR
244000	246000	membership stream planned.
246000	248000	As well, at the end of this.
248000	250000	Now, if we do get hard stuff,
250000	252000	uh...
252000	254000	My plan is to throw mech
254000	256000	assault out the window, and then
256000	258000	I'll just do my membership.
258000	260000	Eh...
260000	262000	Take time for your health.
262000	264000	Literally,
264000	266000	I kid you not, I should have played this
266000	268000	when my...
268000	270000	When my dad gets here.
270000	272000	Because he could unironically...
272000	274000	He plays...
274000	276000	Uh, you know what?
276000	278000	I'll remember the map when we get on it.
278000	280000	The last map, as Atlas,
280000	282000	he absolutely adores
282000	284000	and the other one, he absolutely adores.
284000	286000	There's one where you can, like, level all the buildings.
286000	288000	And...
288000	290000	So, my dad...
290000	292000	He's a wee bit, like,
292000	294000	mean, he's a wee bit autistic, but he doesn't realize it.
294000	296000	And he used to play the same map
296000	298000	over and over again, and did the exact same thing.
298000	300000	Same thing, over and over again. It's rather adorable.
300000	302000	Can you change the difficulty
302000	304000	if you're creating your profile?
304000	306000	No.
306000	308000	It's just, like...
308000	310000	Oh my god, axes!
310000	312000	Viva la France!
312000	314000	Eh...
314000	316000	Yeah, it doesn't want to do anything.
316000	318000	Just stay back facing them.
318000	320000	I mean, I guess...
320000	322000	Yeah.
322000	324000	Whoa! Okay, I guess I just...
324000	326000	Oh wait, current levels
326000	328000	suffer this silence.
328000	330000	It's not much of a sufferage.
330000	332000	I'm guessing this is, like, corporal
332000	334000	ranks, because in this mecha game
334000	336000	you are...
336000	338000	Um...
338000	340000	You'll never guess what.
340000	342000	You're piloting a mecha!
342000	344000	Ah!
344000	346000	Ah!
346000	348000	What are the odds?
348000	350000	Um...
350000	352000	But yes, sorry, I'm just waking up a wee bit.
352000	354000	Oh, aces!
354000	356000	Snowberries!
356000	358000	No, I'm piloting a mecha!
358000	360000	Mech asshole!
360000	362000	Oh my god!
362000	364000	This is both their fault.
364000	366000	Shut up, Isla.
366000	368000	I'll jump in it right now.
368000	370000	Hi!
370000	372000	Snowberries!
372000	374000	Guten Morgan!
374000	376000	I'm currently slurping on my little teeth.
376000	378000	And then we're going to jump into this game
378000	380000	called Mech Assault.
380000	382000	It is an Xbox original!
382000	384000	Not even Xbox...
384000	386000	Not even Xbox 360!
386000	388000	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
388000	390000	This was an Xbox
390000	392000	No...
392000	394000	Wait!
400000	402000	Wait a minute!
402000	404000	This is the early...
404000	406000	The first mission!
406000	408000	Ooh!
408000	410000	It has a lady pie!
410000	412000	Hi, AC!
412000	414000	I think she's going to be resting.
414000	416000	And then hi, Snowberries!
416000	418000	We're playing Mech Assault, we're about to go speak to
418000	420000	the lady!
420000	422000	Now, you might notice my title is the most bizarre thing
422000	424000	you've ever fucking read out of context.
424000	426000	We took part from the heavy Mechs
426000	428000	to fix the Cougar Scout Mech!
428000	430000	Um, well, yeah!
430000	432000	Wait, what time?
432000	434000	I'm going to drink my tea.
438000	440000	Hey, sport, you ready?
442000	444000	I've got our orders.
444000	446000	The invasion still steps off as planned.
446000	448000	We're not paying us to be late.
448000	450000	But the best part is that we get to go in first.
450000	452000	Just like old times.
452000	454000	The Intel boys say the enemy is powering up
454000	456000	a set of nasty, ground-to-orbit guns.
456000	458000	If those are online when the rest of the dragoons arrive,
458000	460000	everyone dies.
460000	462000	And we blow our bonus.
462000	464000	So our little team gets to make a covert landing
464000	466000	outside the range of the existing guns,
466000	468000	sneak across half a continent,
468000	470000	and take them out before our dropships show up.
470000	472000	I think it's Loki, we play first.
472000	474000	I think it's Loki, we play first.
474000	476000	Me?
482000	484000	Wait, is that Logan?
484000	486000	That makes me call Logan.
494000	496000	Wait.
496000	498000	Wait, so that's the intro.
500000	502000	So then, eating dirt is the first mission.
504000	506000	All systems normal.
506000	508000	We're in the pipe. Touchdown in two minutes.
508000	510000	Oh my god. It's like a pixel on my screen.
510000	512000	We've been scammed.
512000	514000	Weapon fire inbound.
514000	516000	Lieutenant Foster, how did they detect us?
516000	518000	Alpha, Bravo landers.
518000	520000	Prepare to hot-drop.
520000	522000	I want you out of this grave now.
522000	524000	Brace yourselves, boys. We're going in.
524000	526000	Is this the first mission?
526000	528000	Or am I picked the wrong one?
528000	530000	Wait, these are...
530000	532000	Wait.
532000	534000	Why does it say select mission,
534000	536000	and I keep getting fucking...
536000	538000	The operation is off to a bad start,
538000	540000	but the Icarus is not granted.
540000	542000	Our job will be much harder.
542000	544000	Why do I keep getting cutscene?
552000	554000	Okay, this is the first mission.
558000	560000	Here's a quick status report.
560000	562000	Alright, it's Cougar Scout Mac.
562000	564000	I knew it was Cougar.
566000	568000	I knew it was Cougar Scout Mac,
568000	570000	because of this voiceline coming up.
588000	590000	Oh.
590000	592000	Oh, my God.
592000	594000	Holy...
594000	596000	Holy moly.
596000	598000	Holy moly.
598000	600000	Oh, my God.
600000	602000	Oh, my PC's ready to catch fire
602000	604000	because it's kind of...
604000	606000	weird thing.
606000	608000	Okay.
608000	610000	So, there's a hidden multiplayer...
610000	612000	So, this game used to be multiplayer,
612000	614000	and there's a hidden function in it.
614000	616000	Oh, yeah, be safe.
616000	618000	There's three baddies.
620000	622000	Oh, my God, my PC's ready to catch fire.
622000	624000	If I randomly go offline,
624000	626000	you know exactly what.
626000	628000	Right.
628000	630000	Oh.
630000	632000	Are they so brave?
632000	634000	Why are you coming up against them, then?
634000	636000	Look at the size of me.
636000	638000	Oh, my goodness.
638000	640000	Right.
640000	642000	So, the thing about NCT 2
642000	644000	is you can just walk on it.
644000	646000	Oh.
646000	648000	Oh.
648000	650000	I don't know if you can hear that.
650000	652000	They're going up.
652000	654000	Oh.
658000	660000	Right.
660000	662000	Next.
662000	664000	Why...
664000	666000	Why changes?
666000	668000	Okay.
668000	670000	Okay.
670000	672000	Next.
672000	674000	Is that a ship?
674000	676000	I think he's glitched out.
676000	678000	Oh, right.
678000	680000	It controls the ammo type by X, Y, and Bravo.
688000	690000	A trained mech of work.
692000	694000	Destroy it.
694000	696000	Weapons. Use your left trigger
696000	698000	to cycle through the weapons,
698000	700000	or just...
700000	702000	It's official.
702000	704000	They know we're here and they will be coming for us.
712000	714000	Coming back for more?
716000	718000	Oh, my God.
718000	720000	Be sure to secure any sound that you find.
720000	722000	The game audio is so loud.
722000	724000	Ah.
724000	726000	Right.
726000	728000	So, we want music down
728000	730000	and we want sound down,
730000	732000	so you guys can actually hear the in-game ending.
732000	734000	How's this?
736000	738000	I don't know why my mic is acting
738000	740000	all quiet all of a sudden.
740000	742000	It's normally like, I'm so freaking loud into it.
744000	746000	I'm feeding it through the thing.
746000	748000	How's that?
750000	752000	Kind of.
752000	754000	How's that louder?
754000	756000	Well...
756000	758000	I see a max gain right now.
758000	760000	Filters.
760000	762000	Gains.
762000	764000	Okay, this is up by 14 decibels now.
764000	766000	Testing.
766000	768000	Test tickles.
770000	772000	Testing the tickles.
772000	774000	Repeat, testing the tickles.
774000	776000	Oh, see, these are health pads.
776000	778000	See that green box?
778000	780000	That's for health.
782000	784000	Maybe we were destined
784000	786000	for the longest collab.
786000	788000	Okay, it sounds much better.
788000	790000	Much better.
790000	792000	Test.
792000	794000	I can't remember what blues for my ultimate.
794000	796000	No.
796000	798000	So, if you lose health,
798000	800000	you can pick up one there.
800000	802000	And then, I guess,
802000	804000	that must be for this.
806000	808000	Again.
808000	810000	Oh, the blue must give infinite.
810000	812000	Oh, almost.
812000	814000	A new...
814000	816000	Attackable one.
816000	818000	Yeah, you literally step on them.
818000	820000	God, this game is actually kind of brutal for its time.
820000	822000	When you...
822000	824000	Yep.
824000	826000	Fucking supply convoy.
826000	828000	Oh, my God, my aimbot.
828000	830000	They never told me this game didn't come with aimbot, okay?
830000	832000	I'm trying not to get hit by it
832000	834000	because it's in the necklace.
836000	838000	I'm spraying.
838000	840000	Oh, that's the supply convoy already?
840000	842000	Holy crap.
846000	848000	Oh, my God.
848000	850000	I can't beat him.
850000	852000	I'm getting rules.
852000	854000	I'm getting rules.
854000	856000	Wait.
856000	858000	Why was my dad so much better at this game?
858000	860000	No, this can't be.
860000	862000	Fuck the rules.
862000	864000	Okay, there we go.
864000	866000	There we go.
866000	868000	Like, I was like, way ahead of me.
868000	870000	Hold on.
870000	872000	No, there's more.
872000	874000	Hold on, there's enemies.
874000	876000	Oh, no, I'm like half health already
876000	878000	because I'm getting too ahead of myself.
878000	880000	Wait, there is aimbot on this one.
880000	882000	Okay, I'm staying on this one then.
882000	884000	Like, aimuses.
886000	888000	The AI in this game is brutal.
888000	890000	Let me heal up.
890000	892000	Don't make me a bad mech warrior.
892000	894000	Come on.
894000	896000	Come on, let me heal up.
896000	898000	There was the turret.
898000	900000	Come forward.
900000	902000	Bro, I'm trying evasive maneuvers.
902000	904000	They're actually not working.
904000	906000	I'm not being funny.
906000	908000	I can't evasive maneuver and aim at the same time.
908000	910000	Can you not destroy these?
910000	912000	You must. Okay, I was going to say you must.
924000	926000	Bro, forget.
926000	928000	They're leveling me. This is the tutorial.
928000	930000	My mech is sparking.
930000	932000	It's actually ogre.
932000	934000	It's so ogre when I started.
934000	936000	My mech is sparking.
938000	940000	Yeah.
940000	942000	No.
942000	944000	My audio is on.
944000	946000	I don't know what the fuck the among us collab did.
946000	948000	I don't know why I'm so quiet.
948000	950000	I can't fly.
950000	952000	I'm literally sparking.
952000	954000	Bro, we're already doing the fucking ace of marching
954000	956000	before I knew it.
956000	958000	Whoa.
958000	960000	You?
960000	962000	Okay.
962000	964000	Well, something just shot.
964000	966000	I was going to say something just shot.
966000	968000	Wait, hold on.
968000	970000	I want to use my summer heal.
970000	972000	Thank you, jeez.
972000	974000	I've got more rocket.
974000	976000	Oh, it's just swapped me a rock.
976000	978000	Oh, and you pick up the ammo tape.
978000	980000	It swaps you.
980000	982000	Fuck.
982000	984000	Stop it.
984000	986000	Oh my god, I'm actually going to lose.
986000	988000	I'm actually going to fucking lose.
988000	990000	Um, this is the tutorial.
990000	992000	I'm not even kidding.
992000	994000	Why are freaking video games so brutal?
994000	996000	They did not care about anyone's feelings.
996000	998000	Honestly, they were like,
998000	1000000	no, you either win or you lose.
1000000	1002000	Fuck you. You have to use this thing again.
1002000	1004000	Like, where's most of these fucking things?
1006000	1008000	Sending a scout unit
1008000	1010000	and a frontal attack.
1010000	1012000	Absolutely genius.
1012000	1014000	And Diego.
1014000	1016000	Thank you for coming to member.
1016000	1018000	I'm to level this city.
1018000	1020000	I hear a chopper.
1024000	1026000	Why do I hear a chopper?
1028000	1030000	Oh, it's you.
1030000	1032000	Oh, this is mean.
1032000	1034000	People are just trying to either.
1034000	1036000	Can you aim for that?
1036000	1038000	Whoa.
1038000	1040000	Who do you think you are?
1040000	1042000	Okay, we're going for the health here.
1042000	1044000	Fuck. I knew there was a man.
1044000	1046000	No, these are...
1046000	1048000	I think these are looking.
1048000	1050000	Oh, no.
1050000	1052000	Oh, no.
1052000	1054000	Give me the fucking health right now.
1054000	1056000	Where is it?
1056000	1058000	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1058000	1060000	Don't do this to me.
1060000	1062000	I'm actually going to lose this tutorial.
1062000	1064000	Don't do this to me.
1064000	1066000	Hold on.
1066000	1068000	Oh, my God, yes.
1068000	1070000	Oh, my God.
1070000	1072000	There's auto lock on this fucking gun type.
1072000	1074000	Oh, my God, please.
1074000	1076000	Oh, my God, I'm scared.
1076000	1078000	No, fuck it. If you fly, I'm flying.
1078000	1080000	Fuck you.
1080000	1082000	How many rockets? I've got two more rockets.
1082000	1084000	Oh, we got one. We got one.
1084000	1086000	Hold on. You're next.
1086000	1088000	Okay, we're out.
1088000	1090000	Are we? Wait.
1090000	1092000	We have infinite aim bomb.
1092000	1094000	We have infinite things and I wasn't using it
1094000	1096000	the entire time.
1098000	1100000	We have infinite aim bomb.
1100000	1102000	Missiles.
1102000	1104000	And I haven't
1104000	1106000	been using them.
1106000	1108000	Right, I need one.
1108000	1110000	Oh, my God.
1110000	1112000	Sorry, that guy was literally trying to do a
1112000	1114000	freaking development job.
1114000	1116000	What do I need to destroy?
1116000	1118000	Head cores.
1118000	1120000	Man, fuck head cores.
1120000	1122000	I think there's a hidden item
1122000	1124000	in one of these buildings, maybe?
1126000	1128000	I'm starting to be in blame to the UI.
1128000	1130000	Literally, I suck.
1130000	1132000	You have infinite ammo for all weapons.
1132000	1134000	Wait, we're just using this one, then.
1136000	1138000	Fuck up this building.
1138000	1140000	Shut up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up.
1142000	1144000	Jesus. You've actually got some
1144000	1146000	decent HP. I'll give you that, Mr.
1146000	1148000	Buildings.
1148000	1150000	There's something shooting at me.
1152000	1154000	Bruh.
1154000	1156000	Am I not...
1156000	1158000	Who the fuck is...
1160000	1162000	I love the love of what...
1162000	1164000	Ah!
1164000	1166000	Ah!
1166000	1168000	Oh.
1168000	1170000	Just...
1170000	1172000	Ah!
1178000	1180000	Wait, and just like that.
1180000	1182000	Ah, right.
1182000	1184000	So we did that one.
1184000	1186000	Never doing last transmission.
1208000	1210000	Lieutenant, can you get that back?
1210000	1212000	I can't, Major. There's nothing to get back.
1212000	1214000	I see.
1214000	1216000	Any sign of the rest of Alpha Lance?
1216000	1218000	No, sir. Captain, get back
1218000	1220000	to the Icarus.
1220000	1222000	For now, it's just you and that scout mech,
1222000	1224000	but this operation continues.
1224000	1226000	Like I said, Dragoons
1226000	1228000	improvise.
1230000	1232000	Right, so we're getting our...
1232000	1234000	Oh, sorry, you can see that we missed it.
1234000	1236000	It's okay, suffering silence.
1236000	1238000	Military Defender's ability to
1238000	1240000	repel the impending invasion
1240000	1242000	by raising
1242000	1244000	their...
1244000	1246000	Home Center.
1248000	1250000	Again.
1250000	1252000	And again.
1256000	1258000	The loudness difference in this game
1258000	1260000	is crazy.
1266000	1268000	Uh-huh.
1276000	1278000	Right.
1278000	1280000	Simple.
1280000	1282000	Right, so we've unlocked the Puma,
1284000	1286000	but I don't know if it has
1286000	1288000	rockets like the other one.
1290000	1292000	Right, we'll try with the Puma.
1292000	1294000	And if we...
1294000	1296000	Puma pants,
1296000	1298000	because I do so badly with it.
1298000	1300000	We'll pick another one, thank you.
1300000	1302000	Sorry, I took way too long
1302000	1304000	on to hit the brim there.
1304000	1306000	I took way too long
1306000	1308000	to do that when I came in that joke,
1308000	1310000	so I literally just went shite myself
1310000	1312000	and then that was the joke. Right, okay.
1312000	1314000	They do seem to have some auto-lock type turret.
1314000	1316000	I'm so sorry.
1316000	1318000	I'm so sorry.
1318000	1320000	But I do like this game because you can like walk into stuff
1320000	1322000	and destroy it. Like...
1322000	1324000	Excuse you!
1324000	1326000	I'm just trying to enjoy the spawn area.
1326000	1328000	That's what I'm saying. These older games are brutal.
1328000	1330000	Like, there's no such thing as like
1330000	1332000	spawn area safety or nothing.
1332000	1334000	I really strongly...
1334000	1336000	Oh.
1336000	1338000	That one just killed his own guy there.
1342000	1344000	Oh, there's a brook floor.
1344000	1346000	Oh my god,
1346000	1348000	he like fires fast.
1348000	1350000	Okay, so here's a thing
1350000	1352000	that a lot of people didn't know about.
1352000	1354000	You might notice that
1354000	1356000	I've got a heat bar on the left.
1356000	1358000	If you stand in water, your mech cools down.
1360000	1362000	And a lot of people didn't know this in the multiplayer.
1362000	1364000	So my dad used to wreck
1364000	1366000	and deck in the multiplayer
1366000	1368000	like far beyond anyone's...
1368000	1370000	like, isn't knowing
1370000	1372000	you how he was winning.
1372000	1374000	And so this was back when Xbox
1374000	1376000	headsets, like, were things
1376000	1378000	who could communicate with the enemy team
1378000	1380000	all points in the game. There were some such things
1380000	1382000	like rounds where you can smack top.
1382000	1384000	No, the entire game
1384000	1386000	someone was blasting music down the mic.
1386000	1388000	Someone was like spamming the N word
1388000	1390000	all of that stuff.
1390000	1392000	And my dad used to wreck and deck
1392000	1394000	on these bit in multiplayer.
1394000	1396000	And everyone used to be so raging at him.
1396000	1398000	They're like, hey, he's cheating. How is he doing that?
1398000	1400000	And it was because he was sitting in the water
1400000	1402000	on Alice, which is like
1402000	1404000	there's really damage in mech.
1404000	1406000	Oh.
1406000	1408000	It's like this really
1408000	1410000	damaging
1410000	1412000	a mech, but
1412000	1414000	his cooldown is like pretty
1414000	1416000	aggressive.
1416000	1418000	Oh, god, I'm gonna shut up.
1418000	1420000	All right, there. I know, those are people.
1420000	1422000	I don't really need people right now.
1422000	1424000	Where the heck did they go? Were they in the air?
1424000	1426000	I'm in the air. Fuck you.
1426000	1428000	All right, there we go.
1428000	1430000	So basically,
1430000	1432000	my dad used to wreck and deck on multiplayer.
1432000	1434000	And
1434000	1436000	the reason why I obviously like, oh, my mom
1436000	1438000	was the first E girl.
1438000	1440000	I'd say that is a joke, by the way.
1440000	1442000	Because my mom used to go and
1442000	1444000	headset and just like have a talk
1444000	1446000	with anyone. Like just like,
1446000	1448000	a lot of folks that like played mech,
1448000	1450000	had Xbox Originals at the time.
1450000	1452000	You were a working person.
1452000	1454000	You had to have internet.
1454000	1456000	You had to have the actual console,
1456000	1458000	which is quite rare in itself. Then you would have to have a game.
1458000	1460000	So it was a mature
1460000	1462000	fan base
1462000	1464000	that opted for this game.
1464000	1466000	And my mom used to go and headset
1466000	1468000	pretending like she,
1468000	1470000	so my dad used to play the game in fucking silence.
1470000	1472000	And my mom
1472000	1474000	used to like be like, oh, I just got
1474000	1476000	here.
1476000	1478000	And
1478000	1480000	my dad would be like, every morning
1480000	1482000	I'd wake up to like a billion pals
1482000	1484000	requests on Xbox.
1484000	1486000	And it makes me laugh my ass off every
1486000	1488000	time they tell me the story.
1488000	1490000	I'm like, my mom was the first fucking
1490000	1492000	girl being like,
1492000	1494000	oh, I just got you.
1494000	1496000	Like all of that down the make
1496000	1498000	and like fucking laugh.
1498000	1500000	It's such a shame.
1500000	1502000	My mom and dad made pals with
1502000	1504000	this guy from Canada.
1504000	1506000	But
1506000	1508000	it's a shame because like obviously
1508000	1510000	they never got like any contact
1510000	1512000	details of Xbox. So they never spoke.
1512000	1514000	But basically he used to get
1514000	1516000	high every day and he didn't have a job.
1516000	1518000	And my mom and
1518000	1520000	dad love talking to him because they were like,
1520000	1522000	what do you mean you don't have a job?
1522000	1524000	And there's like, oh, no, I don't need to pay
1524000	1526000	taxes and he would like tell them about Canada.
1526000	1528000	So
1528000	1530000	Grizzly, if you're out there, my mom and dad
1530000	1532000	absolutely adore you still and they still talk
1532000	1534000	to you to this day. They still remember
1534000	1536000	your game or tag Grizzly.
1536000	1538000	So hopefully you're still getting high
1538000	1540000	as hell and telling funny stories
1540000	1542000	to people in video games.
1542000	1544000	Doing Canada
1544000	1546000	proud literally.
1546000	1548000	So if you ever think like, oh,
1548000	1550000	I don't have an impact
1550000	1552000	anywhere on anyone.
1552000	1554000	Literally, there's a
1554000	1556000	Scottish man and wife that still
1556000	1558000	to this day talk about their old gamer
1558000	1560000	buddy from 20 years gone by.
1560000	1562000	It must be. I don't know how old this game is
1562000	1564000	when they were, wait, can I not?
1564000	1566000	I doubt you're flying. Coming in boys.
1566000	1568000	So yeah, don't ever be like, oh,
1568000	1570000	my life doesn't have any impact.
1570000	1572000	Like there's a
1572000	1574000	nostalgic man and woman in
1574000	1576000	Scotland that still think about you.
1576000	1578000	So, oh shit, I'm overheating. I can't
1578000	1580000	fire.
1580000	1582000	Hold on, let's get this tank
1582000	1584000	first because they're the
1584000	1586000	humans.
1586000	1588000	Yeah, when you overheat you
1588000	1590000	literally can do no damage, which is
1590000	1592000	a bit unfortunate.
1592000	1594000	Wait, what did I join into?
1594000	1596000	What's the context?
1596000	1598000	I'm just saying that even if your life
1598000	1600000	doesn't feel like it's impactful or anything
1600000	1602000	like that,
1602000	1604000	my parents
1604000	1606000	used to play
1606000	1608000	meccosal with this
1608000	1610000	random guy from Canada. They don't have this
1610000	1612000	contact information or anything, but his
1612000	1614000	gamer tag was grizzly and I'm just saying
1614000	1616000	even if you feel like your life has
1616000	1618000	no positive impact, there is
1618000	1620000	a sweet Scottish couple to this
1620000	1622000	day that still talk about this guy
1622000	1624000	that got high and played meccosal
1624000	1626000	every single day from Canada and
1626000	1628000	it doesn't, like your life
1628000	1630000	doesn't have to amount to anything
1630000	1632000	at all. That's not how it works.
1632000	1634000	And it's just very
1634000	1636000	I think it's just
1636000	1638000	Oh, there's a mecc.
1638000	1640000	Yep. Oh, I'm
1640000	1642000	seeing a battle mecc. I don't know about reading
1642000	1644000	a mecc. I just saw him.
1644000	1646000	I see him. He's coming at me like a freaking
1646000	1648000	spoon.
1648000	1650000	Oh.
1650000	1652000	Whoa, hold on.
1652000	1654000	Hold on. Is he crippled?
1654000	1656000	So mecc animations are actually
1656000	1658000	pretty decent. You can get crippled mecc
1658000	1660000	animations. Oh, fuck. I'm
1660000	1662000	overheating and there's no water nearby.
1664000	1666000	Oh, there's no water nearby.
1668000	1670000	I'm out. I'm overheating.
1672000	1674000	Hold on. Let me hide behind this building. Hold on.
1674000	1676000	Hold on, darling. Let me hide behind this
1676000	1678000	building. Okay. Okay, darling. Thank you.
1678000	1680000	Right. I've got a, I can shoot again.
1680000	1682000	Okay. He's crippled. See how
1682000	1684000	he's sparking? That's when you know that mecc
1684000	1686000	is getting weak. Yeah. He's literally on fire.
1686000	1688000	But you ready for this sound when it dies?
1688000	1690000	I'll shut up when it dies.
1694000	1696000	Oh, come on.
1696000	1698000	Whoa.
1698000	1700000	I'm one health. I'm one health in a dream.
1700000	1702000	I'm one health in a dream. I'm one health in a
1702000	1704000	dream. I wasn't paying attention. Oh, my god.
1710000	1712000	Holy. There.
1712000	1714000	Oh, my god.
1714000	1716000	Oh, my god.
1720000	1722000	I wasn't paying attention because
1722000	1724000	I was typically yattin'.
1726000	1728000	Make Grizzly only the most famous
1728000	1730000	YouTuber. Wait,
1730000	1732000	YouTuber, shut up. Imagine if it was him and
1732000	1734000	he's a YouTuber now and I'd be like,

1736000	1738000	your old best pal
1738000	1740000	that you used to talk to daily on Xbox.
1740000	1742000	What the fuck up? Could you imagine?
1742000	1744000	Is there actually someone called Grizzly on
1744000	1746000	YouTube that please make games to shut the
1746000	1748000	fuck up? Imagine. And he's the Canadian
1748000	1750000	and he gets high all the time.
1750000	1752000	So I've got some news from my dad.

1762000	1764000	Oh, no.
1764000	1766000	Whoa.
1770000	1772000	Wait, are you the real Stony?

2461120	2463120	Something

2624720	2628480	I don't see yeah, okay, that's why I don't want to lose health
2634400	2636400	I'm trying to play super safe
2637280	2639280	Because I don't want to
2640880	2645360	Although we could always try a different make if we if we messed up on a mission. I mean the game really isn't the
2646160	2650640	I don't think it's too punishing the missions don't actually seem that long until I'd assume that
2652000	2654000	As if I got hit by
2655040	2657040	There's something coming off of me
2657440	2659440	Right we get it

3298640	3302680	Oh my god, she said honestly slayed you were lucky that the
3304200	3308280	Strategically left mek hearing I am forever and hmm. Yeah
3309120	3311620	The dialogue in this game is like a
3311620	3313620	Oh
3313660	3318540	Captain our objective has always been to disrupt the word of Blake and disable the orbital guns
3318540	3324780	I cannot believe I almost lost the top about right weren't you just telling me that last night cowboy
3325700	3327700	Sirs the job is this
3328420	3333540	Are the commentators, you know make it out to see working each other for the orbital guns
3333540	3336340	So this is critical. The problem is going to be the terrain
3336340	3339940	Hold on a minute. I'm just gonna slow you down. So keep an eye out for shortcuts over dry land
3340100	3342700	What madman would ask Johnny Keese that make
3345740	3350180	Get to it mek warrior time to get wet. Yo, we don't need to know you're like
3352060	3353940	Whoa
3353940	3356100	Lial
3356100	3362740	Billy L a variant of the Ozil is built to field up here or formidable
3364060	3367700	Gossas rifle and I never use rifles, you know that I
3368580	3371380	Don't I don't think I don't think he's the one I
3372540	3374540	Don't think he's the one
3374580	3382860	Now is he'll against a mech is like pretty OP. I'm quite I'm quite biased to zeal right now
3386380	3388900	He is not the one pronounced like
3398300	3400300	I
3402140	3404140	Have no idea what mission
3404460	3408300	So I looked up and they were like this game takes the average to play but I'm like
3408300	3415700	I think it I don't think it takes eight hours. I'm not under the impression. It actually is the ever matter to show
3416780	3421100	Don't have to tell me twice. Fuck it up. Fuck it up. Fuck it up. Oh, you've got a whole breach
3421100	3425460	Oh, no, you're taking water on board. Oh, no, I don't get your life jacket on
3425940	3429060	Oh, it's too late. No, there's not enough time for the life jacket
3434700	3442100	Eight game journalist hours, okay, maybe eight for a hundred percent. I don't I don't think there's any hundred percent
3442100	3444100	There's no like collected or anything
3444460	3446460	Oh
3454620	3460260	That's creative putting a freaking turret on a bridge, I did not expect that you know what video game
3463700	3466540	Yeah, that's what I thought honestly, but do that again
3467740	3470580	Don't even make me regret being so nice
3471580	3473580	I'm missing on purpose
3475380	3482700	Oh, I've done it. That's I just pretty satisfying when it's one shot. It feels like this is a shotgun in terms of late
3483900	3485660	Oh
3485660	3488060	Wow, I'm just destroying the entire river
3494660	3496660	Sometimes
3500580	3507460	Whoa, sorry the controls are a bit funny. Please remember this game is back when
3508740	3510740	Whoa, what was that?
3513380	3520940	Oh, thank God back in the day when they were like made things invisible they weren't actually invisible so they were like being nice to you
3521660	3523660	I
3525300	3531980	Remember playing a similar mech assault game, but on the Xbox you're gonna shit yourself when you find out this next piece of information
3532580	3536060	This is mech assault from the Xbox original
3538460	3540460	Very good game
3541020	3545140	My it's probably one of the first games I was a child
3547940	3549940	Just when it comes to
3550940	3552940	Stuff
3555420	3559220	Can you play that? Yeah, I feel like a
3561980	3563980	Who's gonna love you
3568300	3570300	Destroy the drawbridge
3572620	3575680	Now the townspeople can escape you're welcome
3577180	3579540	Go home are you parish? Do I meet?
3581940	3583940	Oh
3585780	3592780	Did I feel oh, sorry, I was person about sorry lads may just feel this mission cuz I've been having a Katie on
3595780	3600740	Hurry up, I'm sorry. I was freaking role-playing. Okay. I was letting the townspeople escape
3601420	3605180	You need to play with that beggar. I don't know how those
3606580	3610220	Obviously like back in the day. Yeah, those controllers thought
3611300	3613300	I
3615980	3617980	Don't like that
3618860	3623020	Big big coming I see big big on the map
3629340	3631340	Nope, that was just a tiny human
3640940	3643100	You are not giving me a chance
3645740	3647740	Sorry, I did not
3649740	3653100	He's stuck if he's stuck I'm leaving. I'm sorry if the if the game might
3658860	3664060	You didn't even give me a fucking second you didn't even give me a fucking second even I
3664340	3670220	Pissed the ball. I pissed about for like 50%. Oh, yeah. Oh, sorry. My wee Xbox is good
3670220	3674460	It's got dust in the fans. Sorry. My Xbox has dust in the fans. If you saw that my apologies
3677020	3681220	I messed around and that we towned for how long I
3683900	3689420	Literally destroyed am I going crazy. I destroyed a drawbridge and then that was it I was done
3692580	3694580	Bro these games are brutal
3701220	3702100	I
3702100	3704100	Ain't exactly making much
3705620	3711940	Just focus on the river every second you stop to do anything the boat. Yeah, literally timed mission. Hey
3712780	3716660	Honestly, is it all getting done for it? I don't know why video games
3720140	3723300	At least I know was coming up ahead so I can kind of deal with it as a
3724860	3726740	as
3726740	3728500	I
3728500	3733860	That's not what that meant in French. I meant as I arrive
3735500	3739500	That means something else in French. It means fireworks in French
3739500	3744820	So I do apologize the one French person listening in right now my bad. She's sorry
3750780	3752780	Right don't stop
3752780	3754780	Moving down the river
3772220	3774860	Ten shots, please do not pair a friend
3776420	3778420	Well, he's limping
3782780	3784780	Wow
3785660	3787660	He'll point
3791780	3793780	We're just gonna have to keep her going
3795060	3798540	Keep her going that make one some of this you can come get it
3799700	3801700	Let's get some I
3803260	3806700	Hate timed missions. They always suck. Thank you. I'm glad you guys freaking agree
3806700	3810220	I don't know why they insist on them. I hate a cheeky time mission
3810580	3815180	Like even in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, they have like those missions where you have to like
3819660	3821660	Hold on, let me get my game
3822820	3826820	I'm getting a bit more. I'm not gonna lie. I'm getting a wee bit more than I'd like
3830860	3837540	Wait, this is the end of the math if I go in the wrong way. No, I couldn't have the boy
3841180	3846620	I'm trying to chase a ship. I'm trying my best. I really am
3849820	3854900	I'm ready to spank something that comes in my peripheral have I gone the wrong way
3857860	3861460	Because I'm about to start getting the ships we're getting away
3862060	3867460	And then the cutscene is like every like five seconds like oh, thanks. Yeah, I really caught up to that ship. He got me
3870220	3872220	Oh
3878940	3881740	Sorry, I think I'm gonna have to pick up the tail. I really am
3889700	3894180	Okay, let's get a fucking move one. I need to tell sorry I do
3896740	3898740	Here we go here we go here we go
3901220	3903220	Oh
3906220	3908700	That's what I missed. Okay. Okay. Oh
3909780	3913300	That makes much more sense. I was like, where the heck are they going?
3914580	3916580	Disappearing on me like that. I love the air
3917740	3921180	I remember when you need to kill three war generals in
3922140	3924140	Five minutes in a feature
3930220	3933020	Infidel brethren watch and learn
3960500	3962500	You
3966540	3968060	Here's our situation
3968060	3972900	We're landing in what we hope is a secure location, but it looks like the enemy may have spotted us
3973020	3975260	There's several enemy units in the area and
3975900	3980540	Towards our position as soon as we learn you'll need to secure the landing zone
3981340	3985380	More interesting. It looks like the word is transporting a new mad cat
3985660	3988780	We need more firepower. So I want that heavy mech
3989020	3995700	It's against my better judgment, but once you capture the mad cat lieutenant Foster will pilot it back to the Icarus
3996300	3998980	Try and make sure that breathing boy doesn't kill himself
4002140	4007980	Right, I'm I'm sorry, but Ooziel is kind of getting me good. I have to admit that double
4008780	4010140	and
4010140	4012140	That double
4013100	4015100	Will be on the ground momentarily
4017420	4019420	That double
4020300	4023660	Destroying mech so quickly. I'm very biased
4024860	4029060	Double PPC. Hmm. Defend it
4037260	4040900	They know what help they ain't gonna know what help give me
4043020	4045020	Hey
4045820	4049260	Is this their soul is he gonna come through the trees?
4050540	4052860	No, he's actually using hold on a minute. He's using
4053900	4058060	Whoa, you take four heads. Well, maybe I should have gone quicker because he
4067980	4071340	Wait, why this doesn't do any heat damage
4072380	4074380	No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm the only
4075580	4078380	I'm the only one that's supposed to do this. I make myself clear
4083260	4089020	Wait, okay, hold on hold on and then one more. No
4090620	4092620	Shit, I'm over here
4097660	4099660	No
4102940	4104940	Okay
4111260	4113260	I don't know how much health this thing has
4114620	4116620	Oh
4116780	4121980	They really require for god this game got me stressed. This is a I thought gaming was supposed to be freaking
4122380	4124380	What role am I playing the victim?
4125020	4131180	There's one over to the right. I can see on the HUD and he's fucking getting take damage and fuck you you little shit
4131740	4133740	Oh my god, it's like literally on fire
4134700	4136540	Oh my god, stop
4136540	4138540	Stop, I think I'm actually gonna lose the section
4144060	4147020	No more I can't take anymore. Oh, thank god
4148860	4151340	Okay, oh my god
4152700	4158700	Reflings are either baddies. No, we're rebel. Wait, are we the baddies in this game? I was like, we're really goodies
4159500	4161980	Right, I'm staying out the water until I know it's not too
4162780	4166220	That makes go so much colder than the rocket's permanently negative. So that ppc
4167820	4169820	Well, that's why I like camping in the water
4170300	4174540	But as I learned from that other round, right, there's an enemy there, but I don't even think you can
4181820	4184700	He does an awful lot of what's in you in the works
4185500	4190060	Is this I have gone the wrong way, please forgive my ignorant
4193260	4196860	We are the neutral third party that the locals picked to fight with
4198780	4204860	If if if the lower class picks us then surely we're the goodies
4206700	4208700	Sure
4209500	4211500	That's how it works, right
4212380	4217500	I love the tanks taking like a bit of side damage there. That was kind of funny like it almost flipped on its side a little bit
4222140	4225420	The aim control goes different when you're like inside that week two days
4227340	4229340	Hey, you ain't getting me
4229500	4231500	Something here that is getting me though
4238460	4240460	What is that just uh
4242460	4248700	Just a wee tank off you pop off you pop see and you know my problem anymore off you pop
4250220	4255660	Whoa, whoa. Oh, I'm trying to reach out. Give me a freaking say. I see a health though
4258380	4262940	I'll take it. I'll take it. I see health. Oh sugar that went right on me
4264860	4267500	Now's not the time in film trade now's not the time
4267740	4269740	Ah
4270140	4272140	Okay, I need to cool down
4278700	4280700	I'm gonna
4286620	4288620	At least you're gonna have health on this
4289980	4294620	Fuck you. Oh my god. Oh get away. Get away. Did anyone take damage?

4765980	4767980	Oh
4771340	4773340	Bro, you're kind of cramping my sail with your aim
4777180	4783260	Wow, it takes a while to load that for a math admit that's like it's not instant. It's like a
4784780	4786780	Reload
4787340	4793020	Oh my god, but this is so I'm doing like so much damage that things aren't like alive long enough to even hurt me
4793420	4799580	I'm looking at what the AI is trying to do something's sponding because look I'm going for it. He's even
4801180	4803580	Where is it? Where's it? Oh this guy can't fly
4808380	4810380	Is that take reduced damage
4811740	4813740	I think that may be reduced damage
4814780	4817580	Lieutenant has been given your make now you're having the magical
4817740	4818860	Ah
4818860	4823020	Heavy makes can't fly too big. Okay. I like that detail. I assume my little
4824540	4826540	Is there something out here about me?
4827900	4829900	I think something's stuck. Oh, here we go
4835980	4837980	Can't see the fight for the trees
4838540	4840540	Oh
4845340	4850220	That's got hurt. Yeah, we what six maybe six

4859580	4861580	I mean, that was too less
4862300	4866460	So still definitely heavy cat. I'm a fan of a heavy make
4868940	4872380	It won't be more another one. There's choppers inbound
4873500	4875500	more like choppers out of
4876460	4878460	Order instead of inbound
4881580	4883580	Go that one
4885260	4887260	I can see that there's a mech approaching
4888940	4894300	Oh, did I get you? I did not get you. What did get you? Hold on. Let me deal with the mech or something
4898460	4900460	All right, you next and then you
4902700	4905580	All right, let's take the aggro off of the fucking
4912460	4917500	I that missed again. Okay. Wow purple is like putting them on glass
4918460	4919900	Wow

4935420	4939820	Okay, we've got the word of Blake's attention. So now we hurt them
4940780	4946460	One of their key tactical command centers is a nick of everything. We're ever gonna have a chance to get those global guns
4946700	4951180	We've got to take it out. We can't hit them head-on. So we're gonna turn out the lights
4951580	4954140	I like is so large. It has to try to attack
4956700	4961820	We're gonna blow that plant and I take ten beech ever make a soul and I don't think anything came up of the original
4962460	4965260	And I'm like, oh, am I making reach of her history the only mech?
4965260	4967260	We've got powerful enough to handle this is the magic
4967500	4972700	Don't make me making each of your history the first person to make a soul. Oh, you don't have to ask me twice. Oh
4974140	4977260	Um, you're a unique gamer. Yeah
4981420	4986220	Okay, first official mission is the mad cat bright lights dark sea
4987820	4991100	It's a lot for battle tech rare for beachable is that touch battle tech game?
4992140	4995020	Um, doesn't Titanfall 2 count as a battle tech?
4997020	4999020	Right, hold on
4999020	5001020	I'll write that down somewhere
5002780	5004780	Thanks
5006140	5011900	Yeah, literally bro, as I said these games do not follow the etiquette when it's in the tree to fall in
5012620	5015900	You're supposed to like be given like five seconds. Whoa
5017660	5024060	You're supposed to be given some abbreviation to the enemies like shooting at yeah, this game does not give life to the rats
5024300	5031180	Oh, wow, it splits up the aim as well. So, okay, that's really good if it splits up the aim
5031340	5033340	It's technically like less to do
5034540	5040780	Right mad cats can't fly must remember mad cats cannot fly because I'm gonna get confused when I'm in the middle of my fight
5040860	5042860	And I'm like get up get up get up

5675900	5679020	patient for something you know in advance will take a long time and not be
5679020	5682260	stuck on something that you think should be easy I guess yeah like if you know

7502160	7504160	Oh
7509440	7516280	Here's the score the Icarus sitting duck we need to set up another base so we can finish the job and take out those orbital
7524040	7528240	Towers the enemy and I just made my tea there, and I'm like I can read from our own sense
7532560	7534560	So I'm about to figure out
7540320	7543840	Thor on the rocks are we already on Ragnarok are we getting close?
7545600	7548800	Sorry, did someone say oh, thank you. Don't stay down for the
7549760	7551760	Super chat
7552560	7556320	Bro, I just the Oreo just all in my bed extra protein. I mean
7556880	7560080	Uh, cat food isn't fit for human consumption, which I don't like
7560800	7562800	I'd rather
7563680	7565680	Oh
7565760	7569520	How many missions Thor on the rocks are being in close? I'm getting nervous
7570720	7576160	Timberwolf, who are you a variant of the successful mat the timber wolf has suited for any
7577200	7579200	battlefield role
7579600	7581600	I don't
7581600	7587040	I don't use the pew-pews, but I use the shoulder thing below. Is this eight shoulder things?
7587360	7589760	They're faster though
7591680	7595040	Timberwolf right fuck it. We'll give Timberwolf a go. Yeah Timberwolf. Let's go
7597440	7599440	Make sure wonder what they put in the cat food. Yeah
7601440	7603440	I'll fucking out just fondant
7606560	7611200	Forgot how it play like in five seconds. Um, oh it comes to snow
7613840	7615840	Uh
7615840	7620720	Yeah, do you if you want to hear how dumb I was as a child are they gonna come from the top? Oh, yeah, they are
7621840	7623840	Oh, no, they only have super um
7625840	7627280	They are
7627280	7628800	um
7628800	7632080	So this is probably the most disgusting story you're gonna hear all day
7632960	7639440	Um, I used to eat cat food when I was like four years old because I was convinced it would turn me into a cat
7640480	7642000	um
7642000	7648800	So I could have a very vivid memory of uh under the kitchen sinkers where the cat food who was uh like in her house
7649440	7656160	And I used to take a spoon fill out of the tin and eat it because I thought it was gonna turn me into a cat
7656640	7658960	And yeah, it's not my brightest moment
7660160	7662160	Uh
7662880	7670320	I don't know why in my head it was gonna turn me into a cat. It just was like, yeah, that makes perfect sense if I eat this cat food
7670800	7674160	So I I know what cat food tastes like
7674800	7681680	Uh, I could tell by the smell if a cat's gonna enjoy it or not because of this dumb thing I did as a freaking child
7682400	7687920	Um, but it's like I can laugh at it now, but oh my god
7689600	7691600	Yeah
7693360	7696320	My my shock and horror that I just wake up with cat ears
7697120	7699120	I
7699520	7704640	And it and that behavior went on for quite a while. I'm not even gonna lie. I think it was probably a solid month
7705120	7708000	I would just wonder the cupboard a bit. Oh, I need a little snack
7709280	7711600	And if my mom didn't give me a snack, I just wonder
7713920	7717680	And the thing is all cat food labels like have a thing on it
7717680	7721520	That's like not fit for human consumption because of like the guts that they usually like
7721680	7722800	Oh
7722800	7727280	And the worst thing is it's not like it was refrigerated like it was open
7728800	7730400	Oh, hold on. Sorry
7730400	7736560	Sorry video game. I'm telling this really disgusting story. The worst part was it wasn't refrigerated. It's like open canned
7737120	7738160	a
7738160	7740160	Like cat food
7740400	7744800	How old were you at the time four? I was like four not 13. Stay on
7745600	7749520	What if I told you you're not the first person to tell a story like this? Oh, thank god
7749760	7750960	I
7750960	7753520	Feel a bit better now then if that's the case
7754320	7757360	Was it wet? Yeah, it was like the wet jelly in the can
7757760	7762400	I still remember the noise the spoon made as I took it out of the can like that
7763680	7768880	Um, it's absolutely mean. I know I'm so sorry. I don't have any excuse
7770000	7772000	But that's hilarious that someone else told me
7772640	7778160	I don't know. It just makes perfect sense. Like of course cat food people as if that just kamikaze into that
7779760	7783200	I can't see this chopper. He's out of range. But he is there are there is
7784480	7786480	You're next buddy
7788800	7791600	Find and destroy the wobb sense or net
7792560	7794560	Wait, so I need to go back again
7795600	7799040	I get eaten kivel, but jeez. Yeah, like that's why
7800080	7802960	So I'm a bit passionate. I'm like, no, I don't want uh
7803840	7808800	I'd rather cat food said it's fit for human consumption. Not because I want to eat it
7809520	7812000	And turn into a cat. But because
7812800	7819360	I don't think that you should be giving your pet something that you the human aren't fit to consume
7820080	7822080	um
7823280	7829680	Lack of nutrients for humans, but it's generally safe in an emergency the furry arc. No, I'll pass
7830320	7832240	AC's like
7832240	7834240	in development
7834240	7837440	AC was like as far as we'll go
7838160	7840160	Right
7840800	7844400	Um, because we did entertain the possibility
7845520	7849440	But we decided it would be far too much of a
7851520	7854800	I can see so much red, but it's not like giving me one thing to shoot at
7855520	7862320	Um, but we decided it was far too much of a like negative thing. Holy crap. Something is like obliterating me
7867600	7869600	You you're obliterating
7872160	7877840	Right, I'm going the wrong way. Hold on. I guess we have to come back that way. Gee, there's like so many countries though
7880480	7882880	I think there's one in the rocks, maybe
7885280	7890640	Anyway long story short, I'm a special child. Is there one hiding? I'm so confused. It says there's something there
7891280	7893280	There's an enemy back out there
7906000	7912800	You can spam with a wildcat though. What is get you? Yep. I knew you were right there. I can see you on the hot
7914400	7916400	Well, what are you?
7917280	7920640	Okay, so this is the mad cat egg
7933760	7937760	Whoa, something's getting me from behind as well. Holy shit. You pop off
7938480	7943760	I hate when the game does that when these bombs aren't behind you because look how long it takes to freaking do a 180
7943760	7948320	I'm half out as well. I don't like that at all
7956640	7961440	Oh my god, please perish. What's going on?
7964000	7966000	Wow, don't do that again
7966160	7971840	Holy moly, you almost got me. Something up here? Com tower?
7974800	7976800	What's this then?
7977440	7979440	Whoa
7983040	7987120	Oh, it's cool. She's our special boomer on the floor
7989520	7993920	When it was a child, I played with stuffed animals until they just have an even two in the school and they need honey
7994240	7997760	And donate them all to cousin. That's what I'm holding. Oh, that's fucking sad as fuck though
7999600	8002720	I remember my time. I got she got stolen at school
8002800	8008080	I was raging because I knew exactly who did it and then the next year the freaking
8009120	8012720	B-Och came back to school with it a year later
8013200	8018000	And she's like, oh, I ran out of battery and I'm like, yeah, could you stole it off me and it's been a year you fucking
8018640	8020640	bought
8020720	8022720	Um
8024160	8030480	How is the cat tea by the way? Okay before I forget but before the game starts like flashing us
8032000	8035200	Hold on. I'm just gonna run in circles so the game doesn't like flash
8035760	8038240	I don't know why stuffing makes it like panic
8040640	8045840	Did I beat her up? I was like six years old. I did not beat her up. Um
8046880	8048880	I basically I
8048880	8055440	Knew she stole it. I told the teacher but the teacher like obviously didn't have the right to pat down a child or check through their bag
8056080	8057120	um
8057120	8062560	And basically the teacher was like, yes, Ronnie. Sorry, but you shouldn't have like you shouldn't bring
8062960	8069520	Stuff into school that you can lose type idea. Hold on. I'm drinking my tea. I can't I don't I don't sense any cat
8069920	8071920	Uh cat like um dusting
8072720	8074720	In it
8075040	8081520	If I read slime girl one more day, I see slime girl more than purple burglar alarm at this point
8082800	8089200	Name air name air asking for slime girl. That's everyone's getting bent over anyone that types slime girl's getting bent over
8089200	8091200	And I'm absolutely taking a bollican
8091680	8093600	Because I've had enough
8093600	8100800	I'm putting my foot down the scottish vtuber gets asked for a fucking slime girl more than bloody purple burglar alarm
8100800	8104000	Which everyone's obsessed by asking scottish people about
8105120	8107120	Don't tempt them honestly
8109200	8114400	A slime boy remember that time I was entertaining a male branch and then it like completely dissolved overnight
8114800	8116800	I have no interest now
8119680	8120960	Oh
8120960	8122960	Yeah, but what about you know, slime
8124480	8128960	Can you see squirrel eye? It's the french that can you see squirrel they go squee well
8129760	8131760	Who a little squee well
8132480	8134480	Just kidding a squee well
8135200	8138960	Someone needs to make a compilation of every time someone asks about slime girl, bro
8138960	8140480	They'd be at it for months
8140480	8145040	You'd get more content out of people asking me for a slime girl than I do burps in general
8147840	8151280	Yeah, french people go squee well wait, how did you say it's girl?
8153040	8156080	Why a squirrel oh like there goes a squirrel
8156960	8162400	Sounds like a short side deal actually I need to make a short. What was it?
8163200	8167040	Oh fine. I guess you add my wee pog champ. Yeah, it was like something like that
8167040	8171360	I need to make that I also need to make a song cover. So honestly if this game if we
8172160	8177680	Do the opposite of game journalists this game that actually might come in fantastic and I can get even more work done
8178560	8183760	I I my goal is to get a 2k. Thank you audio out
8184720	8186000	Am
8186000	8191520	Though I'm going to do the ear cleaning one because it has a funny little joke at the start. I think that one's the best
8191920	8196080	I'm sorry. I keeping this dream buried for now slowly stewing in fermentin
8196400	8200000	Look if one of the girls say they want a halloween slime variation
8200880	8207200	Fine, okay. It's a whole new model. It's a whole new artwork. It's a whole new design fine. They can have it
8208720	8210720	But no one is asked for one
8210880	8216800	Game journalists or game regroup just a short shawnee shaming us for ideas. No, I don't I'm not shaming
8216880	8218880	but like there's some stuff that's like
8219520	8222800	If you don't know you don't know and like one of the unwritten rules are
8223600	8228560	You know like don't have a cyclops. It's offputting people don't like it as a design debuff
8229040	8229920	and
8229920	8236400	You know someone being green again design debuff unless you made them only a tinge of green and said they were a halfling
8236800	8242560	But she's like a muscle mummy in comparison to the average human sure fine. Let it happen multiple eyes
8242800	8247840	Insect these are kind of unwritten things that are against the the norms and I'm happy to talk about it
8248000	8252160	But I get nervous when I talk about it people take it like oh, she said insect girls
8252720	8259520	Bad that means she hates and it's like no motherfucker. That's not how design works. You have to appeal to the masses
8260160	8264720	The masses and you need to give a model to someone that isn't a debuff
8264960	8269920	That isn't something that makes it even harder for them to succeed as a feature creator
8270640	8272640	hey
8273680	8278240	Oh, the shadows are back in full force. I'm slamming the desk. That's when you know, I was hardly slamming it
8278240	8279920	I gave it a little bump
8279920	8282880	Yeah, yeah slam sly cops. You're done
8283680	8285680	Someone's gonna be like a slam
8286240	8290720	praying man to cyclops that's green. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
8291120	8300000	Give it a little bug pincers as well. Yeah, mommy doesn't hate a single thing. Have you checked her work? She seems to try everything
8300320	8307120	We're looking to hit every demographic not a niche. Yeah, I mean do we need a halfling when we have a cuttlefish that needs a steps
8308720	8316560	I'm not that small. I'm sorry, but five two is not that small. I'm literally bang on average height for the women in the world. Am I not?
8316560	8321760	Am I not as to if five point two not bang average on height
8322960	8324960	Just a slain blob. That's it
8325680	8330160	Every day you push me to form an insect slain cyclops feature agency
8332400	8335120	You just call it like I don't know what you should call it
8336160	8337360	just be like
8337360	8341200	V success and then the the point is to prove that you can have a
8341600	8349120	Successful beat of her as like this design. I think the average five four. Oh fuck me man V slimy. Okay, dude
8349520	8351520	Freaks Incorporated
8351680	8354240	V repel and they do the opposite repel
8357520	8360240	I've almost finished my thing V cute short
8364320	8369280	I'm starting to imagine that brain meme when you go to sleep saying that you have made a slime girl then
8370160	8375520	Oh, imagine if that was the biggest turnaround of the century that there's already a slime girl design approved
8376160	8379680	Hey, and I'm just pretending there isn't and I'm like, oh, I hate slime girls
8384160	8386160	See it
8387280	8389280	Can you tell me twice
8392800	8395440	Wouldn't that not be the the ultimate debate
8396400	8400400	I mean if I pulled that off I'm gonna make if I pulled that off I deserve like all the whole
8411440	8414560	Right, there's a lot of supplies in these barracks, which makes me think
8426160	8428160	I
8432240	8439120	Little bit hold on I need to lure the thing that would be such a dirty move five two is the global average in China
8439840	8442800	Oh my god, I can't believe you guys find out. I'm secretly Asian right now
8444400	8447600	Uh, I wasn't kidding when I said I had a Chinese and a
8448560	8450560	I
8466560	8472560	I really like her voice. I wish she voiced more video games. Maybe she has and I just don't know about it. Her voice is very
8477840	8479840	Well, I could not even see that in bed
8484880	8488720	No, just a few resupplies, okay, okay
8492320	8494320	I love it when she calls you sport
8494480	8498800	Oh, you're such a good sport little reflin even though I know you said that for the commentator
8498800	8500800	But I don't I've never like I've ever called the reflin
8501360	8502480	sport
8502480	8506720	Oh, you're such a good sport watch me play these games that absolutely no one cares about
8508000	8511040	Literally apparently I've made vtuber news by playing mech assault
8511040	8515920	I'll need a check if there really hasn't been a vtuber that's played mech assault. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa bring it back
8515920	8517920	Bring it back. Bring it back. Bring it back now. Yeah
8521200	8523200	Everybody
8524080	8526080	Oh, there's an
8526960	8529520	Okay, I forget that I can hold down a on this guy
8533600	8535840	Oh, I don't have an ultimate on this character
8536800	8538800	Wow, I don't there's no ultimate
8539520	8541840	There's no like defense or anything
8542640	8544960	Uh, I think I'd rather just found this
8546400	8548400	Oh, I'm taking a bit of damage
8549360	8552000	Oh my god, please stop. Oh my god, please stop
8554880	8556880	Stop. Oh my god, did you see those drinks?

8565040	8568480	Okay, hold on. I've got purple on this but it's pretty leveled up to me
8570160	8572160	And it doesn't turn towards my
8575200	8578880	Are you just taking that? Yeah, are you going to take that? Oh, fuck. He's actually getting me crazy right now
8581120	8583120	Okay, and he puts that. Okay. Yeah. Good fuck me

8602880	8607840	Yeah, you never heard of this. It was probably because my old school game knowledge is limited to nintendo
8607840	8609840	Watch it collapsing tunnel
8619280	8622560	Whoa, I didn't even know the game did things like that
8624000	8628480	That's cheeky. That's cheeky. No, you know how to do that only I'm allowed to do that
8630640	8637760	Damn that was loud was it? I'm so sorry the the game volume balance control. I actually might pin a comment
8638400	8640400	uh

8832160	8833200	special
8833200	8838480	Healing around the corner. No, okay. I guess we're not at that stage in video game development when we put like little secrets

8859200	8864080	You're mostly male that ain't going nah guys hate giant robots. No, I'm not like that. Just like
8865440	8870160	I don't know. I feel like some v-tubers normally try and pick the most popular flavor of game
8872160	8874320	Or am I being daft when I say that unknown case?
8878720	8881040	An annoying helicopter squadron is this
8882240	8884240	Oh

8919840	8923760	I hear a chopper. I don't see. Oh, I see it. I see it. I see it. Yeah, sorry
8929920	8932880	Haha, wouldn't it be so funny if you had help or like anything?
8937120	8939120	Having a good jolly time jolly good show
8939760	8944400	I don't care about popular games robots shooting each other. It's like popular to me

9211440	9217200	It's a score. Okay. Oh, you'll never guess why this mission was called Thor. You'll never get
9220880	9223680	Hydration check. Oh my god. I almost lost that. I'm not being funny
9224720	9226480	I'll handle this briefing
9226480	9229840	Captain will have to restrict yourself from engaging the enemy
9230400	9234240	I know this goes against everything you big tough mech warriors are taught
9234560	9237120	Oh, it's an atlas. Oh my god, it's an atlas
9238720	9244000	From inside we should be able to add to their comm center and see what information we can acquire about the orbital guns
9244880	9248160	Then comes the part I haven't figured out how you get back
9249360	9256480	Suddenly I'm glad I'm not a mech warrior. Oh, no, it's an atlas atlas is our tanky is anything
9259120	9263840	My dad actually found a soft lock on this mission. He was so proud of himself when he showed me it
9265040	9267040	Um, oh
9267680	9269680	I'm actually getting nervous
9271200	9278160	I'm getting nervous the Thor successfully blends heavy firepower with maneuverability and a heavy mix chassis
9280640	9283920	Atlas casually doing what it does in lore making people shit their fans
9285120	9288080	my my dad's favorite mech was atlas and
9289680	9292240	Captain you're just outside of the base perimeter
9292400	9294400	So
9296000	9298000	Okay, don't shoot
9298000	9306160	Anyone and don't run over any tank either or a gentleman. Oh my god, they're tea posing. Look. I'm going. Look. I'm we tea posing
9307600	9313680	Oh, he's animated but the other guy isn't yeah, so do not stand on anyone or you get obliterated to the moon
9313680	9316320	So I'm literally not moving until this convoy goes away
9318800	9320800	Okay
9323200	9327680	Okay, I'm satisfied my aoe is not going to upset any of this
9329760	9335840	Steady easy easy. No, I am a friendly

9361440	9363440	Hold on Ray was safe to move
9364240	9367920	We're going to take the the right side because there's nothing other right side
9368640	9371760	Take it easy. Yes. We're friendly. Oh god
9372720	9375600	Oh, I thought I was going to bounce me on his head. Oh, yeah

9422960	9427600	Oh my god, please leave me alone a I please they may suspect something play it cool
9428800	9431920	I'm playing it cool. I'm getting ready to fucking gear up
9433040	9435040	But I need to get near the comm center
9436240	9438240	There should be like five clicks
9439200	9444240	Stop AI is already targeting me. It's already targeting me
9446400	9448400	Oh, no, what is the countdown for?

9464400	9468480	We do not have the information yet to stay inside the base until we get the intel
9473200	9476240	Again friendly Thor, please transmit the code
9478000	9482240	Captain hang tight. We're almost there get ready to move out fast
9483200	9485200	Where do I move out to?
9486480	9487680	Almost
9487680	9489680	Where
9490480	9498720	I fucking wasn't ready. Is that the door? Hold on. I think the door is over here. Please let me out. Please let me out
9498720	9502960	I don't want to go against an outlet. I'm scared. Oh, I'm gonna get some Alice. What did I do?
9504240	9509840	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, like this not like this. How'd I get out? Oh, wait, I can fly I can fly
9511520	9517040	No, I'm hay-bound. I'm hay-bound. Oh, no. I don't know where I'm supposed to go
9517680	9520140	Alice that he go back over the Alice came from
9522080	9526320	Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, wait, I'm supposed to destroy those. No, no, no
9528480	9530480	I can get it
9535760	9544020	We just supposed to go the way the atlas came in okay restart
9544020	9557740	Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's get to it. I'm sure I can
9557740	9567620	outpace everything. It implied the gates were going to open. It bloated, didn't. Was that
9567620	9573420	supposed to go out those gates? Anyone here put Mexico? Either pass the atlases or blow
9573420	9580780	up the generator to open the other gate or go back and... If I go out the atlases thing,
9580780	9587620	I assume they want to fight me. I just want to make sure I don't upset any little ground
9587620	9595340	soldier unit. I think the door... Oh my god, you have to... Right. At least not over the
9595340	9602660	generator's located, but... Did I even have the health to get out of there? Is my question...
9602660	9614460	Okay. So... Okay. No alarm is raised. So begin... So go there and then I'm going to aim at the
9614460	9619500	freaking generator and then I'm just gonna go for it because there's not much I can do.
9620460	9628100	Okay. Right. Okay. And then the generator was around this corner. Okay. Okay. You don't need to tell me
9628100	9634980	that there's enemies. I know there's enemies. Are you winning? We got rigged. We got really
9634980	9639180	badly rigged. They fight you either way. The atlas is gonna hit you with so many bullets for trying
9639180	9653340	to get away. Yeah. Oh god. What's my B? Oh god. Yes. Yes. Friendly. I'm friendly. I'm friendly. I'm
9653340	9663260	friendly. I'm so nervous and scared. I'm freaking trying. I'm in position four, three, two, one.
9669820	9677020	Uh-huh. Okay. I'm hiding behind this for now. Open. Please open. Please open. Please open. Please
9677020	9688780	open. Please open. Are you fucking serious? Open! I'm going, but I'm so slow. What does this mean?
9690780	9697260	I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. Oh god. Please close the gates behind me. Please close the gates
9697340	9702620	behind me. I beg of you. Be close the gate or something. I don't know. Ring the guards.
9702620	9712620	Anything. Please. There's too many of them. I can't do it. Oh my god. This is getting worse. There's
9712620	9717260	an enemy ahead. Oh, but there's health on the road. Okay. Okay. The guards have been rang. The guards
9717260	9726780	have been rang. Fight. Fucking gone. You didn't have to tell me twice, darling. I'm fucking gone.
9727740	9735420	I'm with the wind. I'm with the sky. I hate these kind of omissions. Oh god. Right. We're getting
9735420	9739100	farther. We're getting farther. That's the main thing. Okay. Across the bridge. Across the bridge.
9739100	9743500	Surely, I have to get across the bridge. There's only one way through. The only way out is through
9743500	9749660	a heavily breamed port to be ravine. Follow this in an actual application point. Down there. Oh,
9749660	9756540	shy saw. I'm one HP in a dream. How is I supposed to win this? I'm going to have to look up a tutorial.
9757980	9766140	Whoa. I'm dead. Whoa. Is that supposed to go down the river? I think I'm going down the river.
9773660	9778300	Wait. All I have to do, I don't actually have to do anything. I just have to reach the extraction
9778300	9786140	point. Hmm. Curious. Curious. The trucks dropped the hill. You've made good progress.
9786300	9789340	That was a good attempt. I think I'm to go bottom right at that river.
9791100	9795100	Oh, the trucks dropped health. The trucks. Okay, trucks. Look for a truck.
9797820	9801260	I think that path was right. There was a natural cover around the bend. Okay.
9803740	9809740	Just around the river bend. Strony, maybe time to ask your dad what he did. Honestly,
9809740	9813180	I don't remember him playing this mission a lot, so I don't think he enjoyed it.
9816700	9823500	Which I'm not even trying to agree with his taste in mission because WTF, mate.
9830620	9834140	We need mission control. Papacult is mission control. Right, let's go.
9836140	9842780	That took so long for the gate to open. I'm going to hide behind the generator this time,
9842780	9849740	so I don't take any damage at all. Counter started. I'm going to go behind the generator this time.
9855500	9860700	There is a health pack right there. Can I shoot? I'm wondering if I should take that off on the way out.
9860700	9864220	Okay, right side, there's a health pack when I leave. Oh, this truck has health.
9865020	9873660	ID code. What do you mean comply? Get ready to move out. Okay, green trucks have health in it.
9873660	9882540	Who do you think, huh? Okay. Three, two, one, go. I'm fucking trying. I'm trying. I'm trying.
9882540	9887660	I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. Fucking hell, this is
9887740	9892940	generator. Have someone come see. Oh, come on. Break already.
9896140	9900380	Oh, is it broken? Okay, okay. So what, do you give me health?
9902140	9909260	You're a lie. Okay, okay. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine that there's two atlases locked onto me.
9910140	9914460	It's not a problem at all, as if that building could support the weight of my mech.
9914860	9920780	Sorry, my mech is far too heavy for it. Oh, no, it just takes so much damage because I walked into
9920780	9924060	that structure. Oh, my God, there's three heal stations.
9928860	9933180	Wait, do you have health? Or is it the other ones that have health? Who the fuck is sniping me from
9933180	9941740	the sky? I can't get a break, bro. I don't think I can actually do this. You, you, give me the health.
9942700	9950860	Give me the health. You don't understand. You don't understand. You are mine. You are mine. Give
9950860	9956540	me the health right now. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. Great. Okay, health on the bridge.
9962220	9967180	The only way, oh, I got stuck on that turret again. Oh, God, I'm like one health already. I'm half
9967420	9971500	health already. Please stop shitting me. Oh, there's a green truck ahead. Get the truck.
9971500	9975820	Get the truck. Beat it up. Give me that truck. Give me that HP right now. Give me that health.
9976940	9981180	Fuck you. Beach. Fuck you, beach. Fuck you. Just think I won't do it.
9982780	9987420	God, that thing has some health on it. Wait, I'm supposed to go down. Wait, I'm confused. No,
9987420	9992220	up. Go up. Go up. Wait, give me a truck. Give me a truck. I'm half health. Give me a truck. Come on.
9992220	9996460	Come on. Let me get a range. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
9997820	10001900	I'm so good at this health. There's health. I see it. I see it. I see it. I see it. I see it.
10001900	10008780	Shit. Shit's a base. Shit's a bomb car. What are you doing? Oh, my God. Oh, there's another one.
10008780	10013340	Oh, we're going to make it. We're going to make it. I have hope. I have hope. Fricking shoot it,
10013340	10017420	though. Oh, wait, sorry. I'm flying. Wait, that's why I can't shoot it. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm
10017420	10024300	panicking. Panicking. Right. You. Fuck off. Oh, God, there's a new makeup ahead. No,
10024300	10031420	you're not supposed to do that. Stop. Stop. You're making me so stressed. Oh, I see health. I see
10031420	10038540	health. I see. I see green. I see green. I see green. I see green. I'm doing great. Yeah. Yeah,
10038540	10043900	I'm not panicking at all. I'm not panicking at all. It's fine. It's fine. No, I'm MLG at this game.
10044780	10050860	It's fine. Oh, God, the HUD is breaking. The HUD is breaking. Why? There's so much. Okay, I see green.
10050860	10055500	I see green. I see green. I see green. I see green. I see green. I see green. I see lots of green. I
10055500	10060540	actually quite like seeing this much green. I have to admit, this is pretty cool. Yes, you better
10060540	10067900	have a plan to get me out. Okay, okay. Destroy the bridge when I'm on the other side. Oh, that's a
10067900	10075420	freaking atlas. It's an atlas. It's an atlas. But break the bridge. Break the bridge. Break the bridge.
10075420	10082060	I'm on the other side of the bridge. The bridge. The bridge. The bridge. The bridge. Destroy the
10082060	10091660	bridge. The motherfucking bridge. Oh, you suck so bad. Why do you suck so bad? Oh, no. Oh, no, it's
10091660	10100700	all coming. Oh, why are you not destroying? No, don't lock onto the atlas. Fuck it. No, not like
10100700	10106620	this. Not like this. Oh, no, I have to destroy the bridge to progress. Why? Why would you do
10106620	10114540	this to me video game? Why? The bridge was hardly breaking. I was so close to dying. I was so close.
10115900	10126220	No, I can't 1v1 a fucking atlas. No, why does the bridge die? Why does the ace have so much
10126220	10133420	damage? Why does the bridge have so much HP?
10136060	10143500	Because the rocket did very little damage? Yeah, well, your mom. I did it. I won the game.
10144380	10152300	I won that fucking mission. You suck. You stinky game. You know I blew up that bridge.
10152940	10154700	Freakin' have to use something else.
10157980	10164620	This make only fires two at a time. So much for having make superiority with this one. It sucks.
10172300	10175740	Stony, your spam flying is slowing you down a lot and overheating you.
10175740	10179500	Oh, but I feel like if I fly, they don't hit me as much.
10179500	10184620	Shoot the bridge as you walk across it because it has so much. Okay, I agree with this
10184620	10191020	sentence. I approve of this message. Oh, excuse me. Sorry, you didn't see that. I promise I'm
10191020	10194380	trained in this make and I haven't just put it on for the first, I haven't been inside it for the
10194380	10200700	first time. Great. I will use X in zero.
10201020	10207900	Oh, let me reset.
10213420	10218940	I freaking bumped a building. I'm in a massive make. Fucking give me a chance. How did I get
10218940	10223820	even worse? Literally, I kicked it. If you hit every health pick up along the way and just run
10223820	10230380	serpentine, it'll be enough to get you there. Okay, okay, okay. We can do it. We can do it.
10230620	10234140	We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We want.
10235500	10238700	Yeah, missiles have the least damage against these. The laser works better.
10240540	10245900	Great. I can do it. I have faith. If there's any doubters,
10247500	10254220	then doubters will be recommended to go watch V-Slammy V-Tubers instead of
10254220	10261980	Viller Beach. Oh, that's so stressful. Right, stop flying. It slows me down.
10263340	10266620	Okay, I can do this and I can not hit a building on the way there.
10268300	10272140	All I have to do is not spank a building and then I just need to run.
10276300	10281340	I'm sure someone's probably done this where he has killed everything before. I'd actually
10281420	10289020	be very curious to see if someone's got gameplay of that. Okay. Stop AI locking onto me. You smell.
10289900	10291660	I know what you're doing. I know what you are.
10294220	10295660	Oh, hold on. Okay.
10298620	10303820	Right, we're hacking into the comms unit. Slime arachnid V-Tuber with only one eye and a green
10303820	10309900	skin, surely. Would we be able to do this mission on the first try? I said mods. Take that man out
10309900	10319740	for 10 seconds. How dare he speak like that to me. How dare. Okay, we can do this. There's a
10319740	10324620	little green truck here. If I really need it, then there's also a green one.
10327260	10333980	I'm so terrified about it. You have got this, I believe in you. This is it. This is the run.
10334940	10337340	This is the run because I'm using my X now.
10347260	10355020	Okay, that was so much quicker. Right, don't use your fly. Stop panicking. Stop flying. Use it.
10355020	10359980	Okay, I can do that. I can do that. Right, hold on. We'll get some coverage going through here.
10360460	10366300	Pardon me, coming through. Okay, and then there's a health station to the left as I come out here.
10367500	10372860	Oh my gosh, did I just mess up again? Oh, I think so.
10374700	10375740	Oh, I'm running.
10378380	10383260	Why did they have to make such a stressful mission? You! Give me, oh wait, there's one here too.
10384220	10386380	Right, and then you're next. You're next.
10388300	10396140	I'm fate. What fate? I'm fucking getting annihilated. There is no fate. There's only death and
10397020	10402220	stinkiness. Is there even a health station? There isn't. Oh, you're the health pack. Okay, I found you.
10402940	10408460	Right, I can shoot the bridge as I go along it because, no, not this one, the next bridge. Sorry.
10409420	10415020	Next bridge, next bridge. Oh, something just splattered me for heavy. I don't know what it was, but it got me good.
10415740	10417340	Okay, okay.
10419100	10429180	Oh, ow, ow, that actually took a decent considerable chunk of damage. Ow, please stop, please stop.
10429180	10433580	Please, I'm such a good feature, I'm such a good feature bird. Please, please,
10434300	10437820	God, stop taking tick damage. It's all I ask, please.
10439340	10444060	Stop it. I don't even know what the pylons do when they spot you. Oh god, there's one there.
10444060	10449740	Wait, well, why did all the other freaking mechas time out? Okay, one's on, one's hot on my R-Streets.
10450540	10454300	I don't even know if I can pick this up. You can't even beat over Healed Canyon in those games. No,
10454300	10459580	you can't. I'm full health. Okay, take it as a blessing. I'm full health. I'm full health. Take it as a blessing.
10459580	10462620	Oh yeah, I'm full health. I'm full health. I don't fucking care.
10464300	10469420	Go away. I don't know what the wee towers do, but I'm going for it. I'm going for it. I'm trying my best.
10470460	10481660	I'm a good little mate, and I am doing great. Thank you. Okay, where the fuck do I go?
10481660	10486940	Hello? Should I fuck up? I'll weave it. I'll weave it. It's okay. Back on course, back on course, back on
10487260	10492220	course. Let him get up. Let him get up. Let him get up. Okay, I see it. I see the hell.
10492220	10500060	Ah, no game. Don't break now. I'm almost there. Don't do that to me. Don't be so selfish. Okay.
10501740	10514380	Okay. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm breaking free. I'm solving. I'm trying.
10515260	10524060	There's not a bridge. There's gaining. Freaking. Come on, mate. Come on, mate. Pop already.
10525980	10534220	Come on. Come on. Yes. Fucking shove up your ass. Atlas. Fucking bam.
10534220	10539500	Can you get this one too? I don't know if I need to do this one too, but I think I'm okay. Okay.
10539740	10548220	Okay. Oh my god, we did it. We just need to destroy this one, which I can do. Oh my god,
10548220	10556380	we did it. Yeah. Okay. That's fine. That's fine. Oh, we did it.
10559100	10559900	Oh.
10559900	10565340	Wait a second. Holy crap. Sirs, I know what the word of Blake is doing on this planet.
10565340	10571340	They found some sort of lost technology cache and something called Ragnarok.
10571340	10579660	No. I'm going to signal the other dragoons. Ragnarok is even scarier than Atlas.
10581180	10584940	Oh, no. We know where the guns are. Now we need to stop them before the invasions of the
10585180	10589180	dragons are on. Wait, isn't the dragon the name of Dokey Bird?
10591900	10597340	Oh, she got a new outfit. And a familiar model.
10602540	10606700	Work your way towards the orbital gun any way you can and then destroy the gun.
10607340	10609740	Oh, it's letting me pick.
10612460	10617260	I'm going to say I didn't actually enjoy Thor that much, but Timberwolf.
10619020	10625180	Timberwolf has so much spray and pray though with those things. I'll try with Timber,
10625180	10629420	if not, I'll take on the other one. You don't remember the Ragnarok? Okay,
10629420	10631580	so think of Thor and then change everything by two.
10636780	10638380	I like how they cut coms on him.
10643340	10645260	Right. Again, we might lose it.
10645900	10649740	Sir, you're going to face stiff defense. You may be able to skirt around the worst
10649740	10653900	of it with a maneuverable mech. I don't care what you do, Captain. Get those guns.
10653900	10659180	We have a tamer. If they eat the worst, well, well, well,
10659180	10663420	if there's in the worst kind of game, well, they can give you a fricking tamed mission.
10664380	10667500	Right. I can't fly. Maybe I should.
10671740	10673260	Shit. Nothing's open. Huh?
10675340	10682060	I can't fly. Wait. I softlocked myself because I have something that can't fly.
10682940	10685020	Stop. Wait, can I destroy these walls?
10685980	10693900	Can I open this door for Mimi? I'd appreciate that.
10699420	10703340	I think I, unironically, think I need to start with the new mech.
10704700	10708140	Right. Okay, hold on. Quit mission. Yeah.
10709500	10713100	And then, okay, it was under the guns. We know where the guns are.
10713100	10717580	Right. That's fine. And then give me mad cat, I guess.
10717580	10721580	Mad cat. Well, Thor can fly as well.
10721580	10724300	Sir, the new tool we're receiving is the heavy firepower.
10724300	10728620	Straight through with one of our big gun mechs or take a jump capable mech and skirt around
10728620	10733900	the edge of the base. Your call. Time is of the essence. The other dragoons are counting on you.
10733900	10737340	I'll try mad cat. See behind. Wait, mad cat can't fly.
10738140	10745580	Oh, right. Sorry. Sorry. Let's try that again. Mad cat can't fly. Thor can fly.
10746220	10749580	We will pick Thor. Dumb. Dumb, dumb, dumb.
10750380	10753900	We know where the guns are. One more time for the, one more time from the top.
10753900	10759980	Thor can fly. So we can fly over. Wow. You didn't think it was that hard.
10761100	10764860	Don't forget, lasers are the structure busters. You can break the door.
10767500	10772300	I didn't know that. Right. Hold on. We're using the laser beam. I'm a fire on the laser.
10772300	10777340	Right. I'm going to all lock onto the retanks because it's just so much easier all alone.
10777340	10783180	Whoa. This hardly does any damage on the all alone. Man, I want a mad cat so bad. They do so much
10783180	10793260	damage like all alone. I mean, I like not having to try sometimes. Is that, is that so hard?
10794060	10801420	Yes, you're a dumb, dumb, but you're a dumb, dumb, affectionately, affectionately, affectionately,
10801420	10805180	though. Okay. So there's a health pack. I know a mad cat comes in. There's actually two health packs.
10806460	10812300	That's a lot of resistance. Wow.
10812940	10823660	Oh, here. I mean, this is, this is all locking on him pretty quickly. I have to say, I have to say,
10823660	10829740	it's not, oh, that was some juicy damage he just did there. I don't know what my ultimate is,
10829740	10838300	but I'll use it anyway. Wait, he's even sparking yet. I feel like I've done, who the fuck is shooting
10838540	10841420	that? Fuck off! Honestly, doing my fucking hits in.
10844540	10852620	Hold on, let me please redeem his ass. Oh, sugar. I'm out of, um, oh, he's limping?
10852620	10856860	Is he limping? I think we're doing it. I think we're doing it. Okay. God, this is taking far too
10856860	10861980	long. I think I'm wasting so much time doing this. Like, game-wise, I should not be doing,
10861980	10867260	oh my God, he's literally about to get, about to get each other. We're actually having like a decent
10867260	10875500	break, yeah. And there's an enemy behind me. What the heck? What am I supposed to do? Oh,
10875500	10884460	I'm supposed to go north? Oh, fuck off. Right, you, fuck you. I don't, uh, I don't know if I should
10884460	10890060	send it or not, but given you a timed mission, surely the game devs wouldn't be so evil to give
10890060	10894060	you a timed mission and then give you a billion mechs in front of you for the past, so you're
10894060	10897740	perfectly run out of time and you have to redo the whole 15-minute mission again.
10898460	10904460	Surely. Surely for an old ass, I don't even know when this game came out. I probably wasn't even
10904460	10918380	born when I came out. No, I can't do it. Maybe. Because I never played it when I watched my dad
10918700	10925580	run out of time. Can a mech be left alone to do their job exactly? Is this the right way?
10927980	10930300	No, this is just a fiber.
10932940	10942220	Me. How do I, do I fly? Oh, I can fly. Oh, it's fantastic.
10943100	10950540	Uh, yeah, I think I've taken some kind of shortcut to the mountain. The good news.
10953420	10956060	Uh, okay, okay, okay.
10961900	10964060	I am a little bit sparky.
10964380	10979100	Okay, okay. Okay, I know there's a mech down there. Hold on. Hold on, you're next, mate. Hold on.
10980620	10986380	Oh, are you freaking serious? Uh, can't be arsed when the AI is like hiding. Oh, and I just took a
10986380	10992940	direct hit off something. Lovely. Oh, I don't know if I should be fighting you or not. Oh no.
10994620	11000700	Right, you're just backing off. I don't know why. Sorry, mate, it was not working.
11003820	11010300	I think the laser's on when you put that down. Sorry. Please just take these direct hits, please.
11010940	11019660	I'm begging, please so I can pick up your freaking health. I need it. I need it. I need it. Give me
11019660	11028460	your health. Okay, we're just kind of, yeah, okay, we're just gonna do this, yeah? I'm trying.
11029340	11038380	He's not perishing. Okay, there we go. Give me that health. Give me that health. Okay, I'll pick it.
11038380	11045260	Yeah, and you guys are fucking next. We're slowly getting damaged in the middle of that fight.
11047740	11051900	Uh, we're doing the wrong way. I'm supposed to be going this week. Can you take fall damage?
11051900	11058700	I'm getting nervous. I'm getting shaky. Uh, literally, uh, the guy knew it was inevitable.
11058700	11065260	Right, another mech, but I can see the cannon. Okay, there you are. Fuck me. That's not good.
11066220	11070940	You guys are so cheap. Like, why do you guys get two, but I only get one?
11075500	11081500	The boys? Captain, help me out, question mark. The mad cat is currently going around me to
11081500	11086380	sandwich me. Can you see it on the hard bottom left? The mad cat is going around to freaking
11086380	11089660	sandwich me. I'm not even kidding. Sorry, I think I'm gonna have to move into this health part.
11091980	11097260	Yeah, the mad cat is getting me from behind. I'm not happy with that. I don't know.
11100700	11109500	No, do not randomly swap fucking magazines for that. Oh, come on. Call the weak guy at least.
11109660	11118140	Sir. Oh, I'm running out of time. Oh, I'm completely out of fucking. Oh.
11120860	11127660	Oh, face of maneuvers. A face of maneuvers. That's so loud behind me. Please stop. Please stop.
11128460	11135420	Hold on. I'm over the edge. Oh, but when I jump, right, blow them up. No, I didn't do any
11135500	11141500	freaking environmental damage against them. I would very much like to win this mission in one go.
11141500	11144060	I do not want to replay this mission. I'm going to be honest.
11152060	11159580	I took, like, so much direct damage there. I'm so, the overheat is, like, punishing me so hard right
11159580	11165500	now. And, of course, I never made it. I was a waste of time. Oh, right. Hold on. He's smoking.
11165500	11171420	He's smoking. That's what you get for smoking. Oh, my God. I think I'm gonna have to jump this
11171980	11178620	chicken wall to not get hit by this fight again. Hold on. Oh, I need to get over. There we go.
11179500	11185260	Fuck you. Fuck you. I need to kill. Oh, I'm going to get direct hit off the spam.
11185980	11191500	How much have I got? About eight minutes to destroy this and the next one. I don't like mods.
11192140	11196780	Yeah, you better start limping. You have, you have, limping, limping, limping.
11200060	11202940	Fucking destroy this. I've got seven minutes to find the last one.
11204540	11212140	Oh, sorry. Right. Hold on. Where is it? Where? Where? Where? Where? This way? It says this way. Hold on.
11213100	11217180	If I go up. Oh, there it is. Oh, my God. There it is. It's right there. Holy crap. We can do it.
11217180	11222060	We can do it in one. We can do it in one. Now, let it spawn eight billion mints all at once for me to
11222060	11225980	perish. Sorry, you're going down. You're actually going down. I don't care what you're shooting at me.
11225980	11231580	You're going down first. Whoo. The orbital guns were our primary mission, but we got another one from upstairs.
11231580	11237500	So they aren't our yet. The Icarus isn't fixed enough to get us off-planet, but it can move us around.
11238060	11242780	Command wants us to figure out what this Ragnarok is and seize the lost technology
11242780	11247740	while the rest of the vehicles are at the word of Blake here. So we're off to a hellish wasteland
11247740	11254620	of lava and dust storms. Once more into the breach, A-Tiger. Once more. I'd rather be. We did it.
11256540	11261260	Whoa, we did it. Oh, they give you like double the time. Okay. The new case of our mission.
11261980	11266460	What's the name of this mission? Size Mars? Gambling, whatever floats your boat.
11266540	11272380	Size Mars. We did it. I'm so glad. If you just need the last one, you can take your
11272380	11276700	odds and bomb us. As you know, we are en route to the wasteland. We have received some intel that
11276700	11283180	got me thinking, and I have a plan. Oh, great. First, we have an old two-power armor in
11283180	11288540	hold. Captain, you are just the right size. That added to the fact that we've learned that
11288540	11293660	a number of word of Blake dignitariers are having some sort of celebration during an invasion.
11294620	11300460	Remember that time I actually did the plan. In this power armor, their sensors won't pick you up.
11300460	11306140	The bad guys won't go on full alert. You will face defenders just not their whole force. Get
11306140	11310860	through their base and find their mechs. Steal one, and then you'll be inside their defenses,
11310860	11314300	giving them hell before they know it. Steal a mech. Move through the small city,
11314300	11319420	demolish the regional palace, and crash their little party. What can I say? Brilliant.
11320380	11327660	Steal a mech. Can I steal an alice? Elemental, a suit of powered... Oh, that makes me want to play
11327660	11334060	cameo. Sorry. A suit of powered battle armor. An elemental is no match for mechs in single...
11334060	11339580	Who goes out? Combat. Hmm. Hmm. My size matters.
11339580	11343260	Let me defense should be minimal, though I recommend you stay away from combat.
11343260	11356540	Whoa, I'm so cute. Oh my god. I'm so cool. Oh, look at me go. Oh, I'm so fast. Holy crap. Like,
11356540	11363900	but I don't have much thrusters to me. Oh, I'm so cute. Oh, sorry. Wait, what are you...
11363900	11373740	What even armor? Is something shooting me? There is. Whoa, I can hear it.
11383100	11383660	What did I do?
11383660	11388460	What sort of scraps do I...
11391500	11395660	I hear. Whoa, I have so much lift.
11399660	11406220	Scissors and enemy over here. Whoa. Okay, thank goodness fall damage in a mech suit isn't a thing,
11406220	11411660	because... There's something red over here, so I assume that's where I'm supposed to go.
11411900	11423820	Whoa. Whoa, who, who, who, who? Oh my god, so this is what it's like to be like a tiny
11423820	11433740	big round unit. Okay, we got him. Who next? Wait, I didn't get him. It's so rich.
11434540	11435740	Wow.
11443740	11444380	Up here?
11447500	11451340	Sorry, I don't really have much of a recollection of this at all.
11451340	11455340	Oh.
11460620	11468460	Am I going too fast for you? Too bad. Plop, plop, plop, plop. Oh, there's a wee baby one.
11468460	11477180	That's what we're fainting. Okay, hold on, wait, wait, hold on, let me get into the fight.
11477900	11481420	Geeze, is this Out of Bones? Is that why? I think this might be Out of Bones and
11481420	11486300	he's like an invisible wall. Well, I got a lick off on someone. Oh crap, how'd I get around?
11487900	11494460	Sir, I'm reading an incoming mech. Somewhere. It must be using no sig. Captain, you can't fight him.
11494460	11501020	Get a move on. No, no, don't give me a run and map again. I get too stressed out when you give me
11501020	11510780	run maps. Wait, what the heck am I supposed to...? Something's dying behind me. I'm so confused
11510780	11519420	where I'm supposed to go. I'm so sorry, guys. This door? Okay, is this like maybe a generator
11519420	11524940	to open a door? There's two mechs after me now. Whoa, whoa, whoa, I can hear it freaking
11524940	11529660	charging up against me. You just relaxed me. What am I supposed to do?
11532380	11537980	Sorry, I'm probably gonna die, but it's too too confusing rather than being bad.
11538620	11543260	Well, I am bad, but I don't... Is there something back there?
11546620	11548700	Was I supposed to kill a generator?
11548860	11559100	Huh. There's three. Just run, but run where? Oh, shit.
11562700	11567180	Oh, my, my gear is on for registering now. Oh, okay, it's registering again. Hold on.
11568620	11573900	Am I just wee enough that they can't shoot me? Well, they can shoot me a wee bit, but where am I?
11574700	11580860	Sorry, sorry. Let me just focus on the map detail, because they wouldn't put sections in the map
11580860	11587580	if they weren't supposed to go near it, kind of. Right, so it is that gate, but how do I get over it?
11589260	11590540	All right, I'm low health, that's all.
11593740	11596780	You mean you're confused because of how good I am at the same exact...
11597660	11602620	Is it... And before it just opens... Oh, for fuck's sake! Come on!
11606940	11615020	As if that was the solution! I was joking! Oh, of course it was. I wasted so much health,
11615020	11620060	no. I don't know if I'll make it run through. Yeah, they don't even drop health because we're so
11620060	11631500	Chinese. Oh, well, oh well. Okay, we'll try again next run. At least we know the gate opens.
11632380	11636300	Good job, sir. Had me sweating. You were sweating, briefing boy.
11643660	11646220	Let me guess, this break, it kind of looked breakable.
11648300	11652700	Or not. Oh, it's a shame they don't give you a health pack anywhere.
11654060	11656940	Right, we'll know much better than for next time.
11661500	11666380	Hmm. Okay, so come down the lava path, they take a little lift.
11666380	11670460	When in doubt, just walk out. Once again, Stroney assumes she can't go somewhere without trying.
11670460	11675020	I mean, every other part of the game has been like, you can't go there, you must destroy
11675020	11689340	something in order to do it. So, XK is... So, as I was saying, XK is me.
11690300	11693900	For, um, assuming otherwise.
11700300	11703420	I am definitely getting Kablamo's, like, right now by that guy.
11707580	11715980	In a cavern. Secret cavern. Secret cavern. Fly away from the loofy.
11716940	11721180	The Cougar. Secret, secret, secret, secret cavern.
11723260	11726780	How am I doing this on one HP? Seriously, drop me at least one HP.
11726780	11729820	Like, don't be shy, game. Don't be shy. Drop me one HP.
11738220	11743420	All of it? All of it feels good, man. Have I cornered myself? Be honest.
11745980	11748860	I haven't cornered myself. I need to keep going. Keep going.
11749580	11751980	We're breaking free. We're so good.
11755820	11757500	There's no a-me-king.
11759820	11763500	Uh, a tank. I can handle a tank in my wee baby armor.
11763500	11766940	I can handle a tank. Look, Zia, just scream free.
11768620	11771500	I'm praying. I'm praying. I'm praying. I'm praying. I'm praying.
11772140	11777420	See? All is good. This game, I ain't got nothing to worry about in my little elemental guy.
11777420	11782540	I'm so tiny and cute, okay? I need to stop flying. I need to destroy these guys.
11782540	11788700	Wait, there's someone behind me? It's Zia! Naughty. You're not supposed to go behind me.
11791020	11793500	Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. I don't have infinite health.
11794220	11798700	If you could all just group up and stop and start missing your shots, that would be great.
11798780	11801820	Please, group up and start missing your shots. Thank you.
11803260	11807340	This has been... Oh no, the cougar is coming up to me.
11808380	11810540	Better get a move on. The cougar is chasing me.
11813340	11818620	P.O.V., you're a college boy in the classic American popcorn film.
11818620	11820300	The cougar is coming for me.
11822780	11826860	See? See? They said blast the building because the gate is controlled by it.
11829260	11833180	Does that actually mean that, or did it not mean that? Oh, this, sorry.
11834380	11839420	The comb's coming. Let me in. What's in here? Other than...
11840540	11847900	Jackpot, kid in a candy store. Captain, um, Captain, stop window shopping. The Atlas will do fine.
11849900	11853740	Atlas time! Let's see how we do with this stop, boy.
11854700	11861100	Whoa. Hello. Daddy's home.
11869900	11873740	Okay, let's see. Oh, next mission.
11873980	11880460	No, still same. Still same.
11886220	11887260	I remember.
11893420	11895580	Okay, I don't want to waste too much ammo on that stuff.
11896460	11897900	Okay.
11901980	11903500	Oh, one hit, baby.
11908220	11909820	Well, I bet he regrets it now.
11913740	11916060	Show em' this. Size max.
11916060	11916940	Whoa, it's probably the...
11919660	11920780	Wait, hold on. How do I aim?
11921100	11925500	Okay. Holy. Holy schmooze.
11926300	11928940	Holy schmooze. No, back up. I hate when they do that.
11934700	11935900	Stop. Hey, dang.
11937980	11942940	I'm overheating. Oh, my God. The Atlas has very limited mobility.
11942940	11946700	Holy crap. Like, even turning to look at him? Very limited.
11947660	11949260	Okay. Enough out of YouTube.
11951020	11953020	Jeez. Let's see what we got here.
11955980	11959100	Okay, there we go. Yeah, the mobility is like,
11959100	11960940	whoa, it's rough trying to do it.
11960940	11963260	But I actually like that detail being like,
11963260	11966220	oh, I almost fell into the lava. You didn't see that.
11966220	11969660	And I like that it feels like, oh, you know.
11970380	11972860	The only thing about that was we caught him napping.
11972860	11974700	Punch through that weakened wall section.
11974780	11976700	We caught him napping? Sure.
11979980	11981820	Right, let's see what we're up against.
11981820	11984140	Right, it's a few tanks. Nothing that I can't even do.
11985180	11986700	Whoa, there's...
11986700	11988940	You take forever to shoot for how...
11990060	11990540	Please.
11994060	11998540	Nope, you do not need to start destroying the natural rock foundation.
11999740	12002380	As fine as it is.
12003340	12004620	Here's the next.
12005660	12006620	That's a barrier.
12009500	12010860	I complete this game all day.
12013340	12015580	Has everything just got more HP all of a sudden?
12015580	12017420	Oh, wait. Oh, it's just a cougar.
12019260	12022700	Uh, I'm scared.
12022700	12025740	I don't like the lack of mobility.
12028540	12030860	I'm talking about... Where is it? Oh, it's down there.
12030860	12032380	Okay, he's in the lava? Hello?
12032380	12033260	Are you hurting yourself?
12035260	12037420	Oh, make it rain hell.
12038220	12039980	Oh, please.
12041100	12044860	Okay, I'm completely comprehend why the Atlas was my dad's favorite mate.
12044860	12046300	Because, oh my goodness.
12047900	12049100	Literally make it rain.
12051100	12051600	Yeah.
12054300	12054940	Oh, gosh.
12056620	12057420	Oh, hold on.
12058380	12059260	What's this one?
12061580	12064140	Oh, wow. That's actually really overpowered as well.
12064140	12066460	Is there any health pack for troops during this one?
12067180	12069740	You look like... Yeah, we got it.
12070940	12074540	Lack of mobility makes up for the HP, the armor,
12074540	12077020	and then the four death rays attached.
12077020	12077980	Also, real guns.
12079100	12080300	Yes, I quite agree.
12080300	12081180	Wait, am I going down there?
12083180	12085740	I came from there.
12087260	12088700	Yeah, question mark.
12089100	12094220	Was this the one that got him all the wins on multiplayer?
12094220	12094620	Yeah.
12095180	12095740	Wait, I must be...
12097420	12099100	I didn't say I must be supposed to go through the lava,
12099100	12100140	but I didn't see it, right?
12103180	12103580	Right.
12105180	12105820	Oh, I see it.
12106620	12107900	Can I get it before it gets me?
12109420	12110140	I can.
12110140	12110700	You too?
12113100	12116860	Oh, it's so nice being able to reach the enemy before the enemy gets you.
12117820	12118460	Oh, shit.
12119580	12120940	See something in the distance?
12120940	12121900	It's very blurry.
12121900	12123420	I don't know how blurry it is for you, but...
12124700	12125500	The mech just...
12126220	12126780	The mech.
12126780	12128060	The enemy just like...
12128060	12128380	Whoa.
12129100	12129740	Look at that.
12129740	12130380	That's so nice.
12132940	12134380	Right. Hold on.
12135980	12137100	Okay, let's go.
12137100	12137740	Mech time.
12137740	12143180	Who are we against in this lovely enemy?
12143980	12149180	I think because of his health being so low,
12149180	12150780	we're just gonna blow this guy down.
12152220	12152940	Easy, easy.
12152940	12155740	And actually, we could probably drop the bridge on him.
12155740	12156300	You know that?
12157420	12159980	Oh, I want his health outside the lava though.
12159980	12160940	Yeah, there we go.
12160940	12162060	No, don't go in the lava.
12162700	12163100	Sugar.
12163820	12165020	He fell back and...
12165020	12167500	Well, it's not like we need a major HP.
12167500	12167820	I don't know.
12167820	12170060	Maybe we can touch it gently.
12170060	12170540	Easy.
12171100	12172140	Just tip two.
12172220	12173260	Hey, we go.
12174700	12175260	Right, we're dead.
12179340	12182060	I'm gonna break the bridge so the lava isn't a problem.
12182060	12183660	Because I don't want to lose health the lava.
12186860	12187500	I can't...
12187500	12188460	I see nothing.
12188460	12191340	Yeah, it's a very cloudy game.
12192220	12192460	I...
12193340	12194300	I guess we did.
12194300	12195500	It's kinda a bit cloudy.
12195500	12196380	Is this not gonna break?
12196380	12196940	Can you break it?
12199580	12201020	Lasers will break it faster.
12201020	12202380	I'm gonna hold it off for the mech.
12204220	12204700	I assume...
12206140	12208140	Well, I assumed completely wrong.
12208780	12211100	I am actually gonna have to walk in the lava a little bit.
12213020	12213900	Oh wait, no, no.
12213900	12215180	Oh, wow.
12215180	12215420	Okay.
12216780	12219180	I just love making things harder for myself,
12219180	12222380	clearly, because spending the time to do that
12222380	12225260	only to yield absolutely nothing is pretty good.
12225260	12225900	That's not good enough.
12227020	12229020	Right, I've been given special services.
12231180	12231980	Partygoers?
12231980	12232300	Where?
12233340	12233820	Oh, here.
12236220	12237020	Uh...
12237020	12237580	In here?
12238860	12239660	Whoa!
12239660	12241980	That's the lava in me that came out of nowhere.
12242620	12243420	Are you these guys?
12243420	12243820	One...
12243820	12245180	Oh, there's a mech on the battlefield.
12245180	12245740	Hold on.
12245740	12246300	Mech first.
12247500	12248140	Oh, hold on.
12248940	12249260	Two!
12250060	12250540	Atlas!
12253900	12255340	Is that an Atlas or a Magiskun?
12255340	12256060	Scoot's Freddy.
12257020	12257500	Okay.
12260700	12261420	Is that an Atlas?
12262620	12262940	No.
12262940	12264060	It's just tangible.
12264060	12265420	No, it is an Atlas!
12265420	12266620	Oh, dear.
12266620	12267180	Oh, dear.
12269980	12270860	Oh, dear.
12270860	12271580	Oh, dear.
12271580	12272780	Little Atlas moment.
12272780	12273260	Tee hee.
12273980	12274220	Great.
12274220	12275020	So what do I need to do?
12275020	12276300	Take my one by one,
12276300	12278620	and then just hook up all their insides.
12280460	12281180	And then your neck.
12282780	12283180	Wah.
12284780	12285500	Wah.
12285500	12286300	Not good, not good.
12286300	12287420	I can't see nothing bumping.
12287420	12288380	Pick it up, whatever it is.
12289100	12291580	Okay, we're just gonna do this on the Atlas.
12292540	12293420	It's the best we've all.
12293420	12294620	Right, Atlas down first.
12294620	12295020	Hold on.
12295820	12296860	Is he smoking yet?
12298220	12300540	I'd rather you smoke first than me, buddy.
12300540	12301180	To be honest.
12301900	12303100	Nah, let's rubbish that.
12304620	12305340	Right.
12305340	12305820	See you!
12306940	12307660	Oh, sugar.
12307660	12308700	I'm low health.
12308700	12309980	Not good, not good, not good.
12310860	12312940	Oh, it would suck if I had to restart.
12312940	12314060	Come on, one big chug!
12314060	12315340	One big chug on him!
12315420	12317100	No, stop flying, mate, stop flying.
12317100	12318540	Give me your health, give me your health.
12318540	12319740	Give me your health, give me your health.
12319740	12320300	Oh, right.
12320300	12321340	Give me your health then,
12321340	12322460	if you're gonna go down first.
12323100	12323820	Please!
12324380	12325500	I'm on my knees!
12327580	12328220	Oh, sugar.
12328220	12330220	I have to literally walk into this guy's bullet.
12331100	12333180	Oh, that was so lucky I managed to cut that health.
12333180	12333820	Holy crap.
12335660	12336060	Wah.
12337740	12339980	Wah, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.
12339980	12341020	Sorry, it's not luck at all.
12341020	12342700	It's skills, complete and utter skills.
12343660	12346700	I'm the daughter of a meccosalt prodigy.
12346700	12348780	I will not have anything else.
12348780	12351180	Right, I'm gonna look for any green buildings
12351180	12355740	through the absolutely smoky haze that is this game.
12355740	12357100	Holy, holey moley.
12357100	12358620	I cannot see for the life of me.
12360620	12362140	Any green at all.
12362140	12363900	Like, seriously, any green at all.
12363900	12367980	Or any hidden green, no.
12367980	12368460	Am I okay?
12369180	12369980	That was worth it.
12369980	12373740	What is that off the head?
12376380	12376860	What is?
12379980	12381900	Oh, I upset something.
12381900	12383020	Hold on, how do I get around?
12385180	12386620	Just firing, I'm just firing.
12386620	12387900	How do I get around?
12388780	12389580	Is there no around?
12389580	12390460	Is there only through?
12391660	12395020	Sorry, my mobility's so slow that I'm trying to...
12395020	12396540	Oh god, this looks like the path though.
12396540	12398300	Oh, dumb ass, there's a path right there.
12399260	12401340	I hope that there's something that's able to shoot me.
12401340	12405180	Yeah, lucky shot, not lucky shot at all.
12406300	12409420	As, eh, right, hold on.
12409420	12410780	And then there's one over there.
12410780	12411740	Can I see it?
12411740	12413340	Nope, but you can see me or not?
12415740	12416460	Nope, I missed.
12417420	12418860	Something blew on my HUD.
12418860	12421020	Bottom left, top left.
12421020	12424460	Sorry, I'll let him bolt for health or something.
12425260	12428380	Destroy this.
12430540	12431500	I'd rather...
12431500	12433260	Oh, I want to save my other ammo.
12433260	12435100	Whoa, it makes the team out.
12435100	12435740	I can't see him.
12437980	12440060	Okay, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
12440060	12442780	I can moan down, I can moan down, I can moan down, it's fine.
12443740	12444620	Oh god, he's got...
12445740	12447420	I'm overheating like hell on there.
12448780	12450540	Hold on, mate, can you just pause the fight?
12450540	12452460	Pause the fight, I need a heal.
12452460	12453020	Sorry, I need a...
12455180	12459660	Not good, not good, not good.
12459660	12461260	Oh god, he's burning though.
12461260	12462300	That's what I want to see.
12462300	12463980	That's what I want to see, not me though.
12466860	12468780	We're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it.
12468780	12469340	We're doing it.
12469980	12472140	True protégé, momento.
12472140	12473500	Right, what's going on here?
12473500	12475660	Did I not successfully destroy that?
12477020	12478140	I don't really want to...
12480540	12481020	I don't want to...
12481180	12482300	All is quiet.
12482300	12484780	The Blake brass has been eighty-six years fled.
12484780	12486380	All combat forces have been in the way.
12486380	12487420	Okay, okay.
12489180	12492380	Wow, that's why I want to hold on to the ch-ch-ch-ch-amel
12492380	12493260	because it's soon.
12495260	12498140	Was it too much to ask that that lunatic was at the party?
12499420	12501900	Captain, we are en route to your current position.
12501900	12505180	The Major has decided to bring the Icarus down right where you are.
12505180	12507740	Foster, let's try not to crash this time, eh?
12511980	12514220	Okay, a little slo-mo, a little slo-mo.
12514220	12514540	Okay.
12516380	12519100	We've obtained information that more suspected rebels
12519100	12522460	are being made to work in factories reinforcing the word of Blake.
12522460	12522860	Uh-huh.
12522860	12524620	We can kill two birds with one stone
12524620	12527180	by freeing the prisoners and destroying the factories.
12527180	12528860	We're going to hot-drop you in, sir.
12528860	12530940	Destroy local forces between you and the camp.
12530940	12531420	Secure escape, bro.
12531420	12534780	Take the camp towers out and, as always, flatten any hostile troops.
12536300	12538540	Okay, I'm gonna take a hydration.
12538540	12540140	Everyone please do hydrate.
12540220	12544300	Shawnee destroys your mech and takes you as a trophy ASMR win.
12549260	12551580	How rich do you have to be to build a mansion in a volcano?
12551580	12554140	I mean, why would you even want a mansion in a volcano?
12555500	12556060	Ugh.
12556060	12557100	Okay, I've hydrated.
12558860	12559900	Uh, right, let's see.
12560780	12561100	Okay.
12562060	12568220	Well, an assault class mech, the Atlas is an offensive force rarely matched.
12568300	12568940	Yeah, sorry.
12568940	12569980	I'm picking Atlas.
12570540	12572140	If we're gonna get a lot of this,
12572780	12575500	game does a good job of making these bad guys seem bad.
12575500	12576700	I hope I'm not the bad guy.
12577260	12579340	Well, we're already on mix fight.
12579340	12580620	Hold on, there's a wee guy there.
12581180	12582380	Can you all lock on him?
12582380	12582780	Thank you.
12585820	12587420	Did we chop her as well while we're at it?
12587420	12588140	Hold on.
12588140	12588380	What?
12588380	12588860	Nope.
12588860	12590060	That's not gonna attack me.
12590460	12590960	Okay.
12594060	12598460	That's currently installing mods to give me extra XP to use.
12598460	12599740	XP is XP, is that it?
12601260	12603580	Wah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
12607260	12607820	Okay, hold on.
12607820	12611580	I think this might, oh wow, that shotgun blast definitely is the one.
12613180	12616700	Get out of the lava so I can at least scavenge your dead parts.
12620300	12620940	Come on.
12620940	12621420	Yeah.
12622940	12625580	Oh no, I can't pick it up.
12626300	12627900	It broke the magma.
12629500	12630620	Ah, draft.
12631340	12632860	Okay, it's fine, it's fine.
12634300	12635980	Racing for racing, but it's fine.
12637660	12638940	Can't pick up the supply.
12638940	12640780	Okay, the magma breaks.
12640780	12643100	I assume it will break under the weight of my mix.
12643100	12646860	You know, all things considered, I probably weigh how many tons?
12647980	12648780	On ironically?
12650540	12655660	I don't want to waste too much of the shotgun.
12655660	12658220	The shotgun seems so effective against the enemies.
12659580	12660780	I can see you guys.
12660780	12661980	I can't target you.
12661980	12664220	I wonder why it's not enjoying the targeting as much.
12665580	12666080	Hmm.
12667980	12670860	Oh wow, that's actually a decent chunk, so I mean, hold on.
12672220	12673180	Stop it, stop it.
12673900	12675580	No, no, no, don't hide from me now.
12675580	12676780	You started the fight.
12676780	12677900	I'm gonna end it.
12677900	12680700	Do you understand your actions have consequences?
12680700	12681820	You're gonna find out now.
12681820	12682300	Goodbye.
12683180	12684940	And I'm here if you were following orders.
12684940	12685580	You're done for.
12685580	12686540	How much have I got?
12686540	12688620	Oh wait, I've got infinite bullet ammo as well.
12689340	12690380	But I've only got...
12690380	12692380	Oh wow, okay, sorry, I'm just gonna use the...
12693660	12694220	Who have I got?
12694780	12697180	Okay, let's get rid of you and then let's get started on you.
12698700	12701500	But you'll need to come down so I can pick up your supplies, okay?
12705180	12706780	Yeah, that's exactly what I want.
12706780	12707420	Okay, perfect.
12708300	12708860	I...
12708860	12711100	No, no, no, no, you're gonna...
12711900	12713820	Can the game kill itself in lava?
12715740	12716220	Hold on.
12717500	12719740	I need you to pick up your stuff.
12719740	12720620	I'm not even kidding.
12720620	12721820	Please, just perish.
12721820	12723500	Come on, please, game.
12724540	12724940	Wow.
12725900	12727980	100 tons of Atlas, I believe it.
12729100	12730060	How much health?
12732380	12733100	How much heal?
12733820	12734300	Like that.
12735900	12736380	Like that.
12736380	12736780	Right, yeah.
12736780	12737580	We're just shotgun.
12737580	12738220	You're totally crap.
12738220	12739900	The shotgun on the Atlas is something else.
12742780	12744620	You know, I didn't even tell my dad I'm playing this game
12744620	12746540	because they are probably filming after the stream
12746540	12747420	if it's not too late.
12751980	12752380	I'll be like,
12752380	12753020	stop!
12753020	12753980	I think it's an outpost.
12753980	12755740	You're right to the outpost comm tower.
12755740	12756460	Dust it.
12756460	12757820	It'll be kicking me off the PC
12757820	12759420	so you can play it, actually, when it gets here.
12759420	12759900	But now...
12763180	12763900	Come on.
12763900	12764540	Stop it.
12764540	12765820	There's so many wee ones.
12766620	12767820	But their damage adds up.
12767820	12769660	Like, that's the problem with it.
12769660	12770380	I add up.
12770380	12771100	Where's that?
12771100	12772220	Oh, my God, I see it.
12772780	12774060	No, and it saw me.
12774060	12774540	Drap.
12775900	12776940	What's going on here?
12776940	12777820	I don't...
12777820	12780700	Why is there so many health stations?
12782140	12784620	Why is there so many health ups?
12785740	12787820	There are, like, six around me.
12787820	12788300	Hold on.
12788300	12789020	How many am I?
12789020	12789660	I don't know.
12789660	12790220	I don't know.
12790220	12790620	I don't know.
12790620	12791260	I don't know.
12791260	12791980	I don't know.
12792140	12792860	How many am I?
12794460	12795260	Oh.
12795260	12796060	That's why.
12796060	12797740	Because there's a new mech coming in the way.
12798460	12799260	Where are you?
12802220	12803180	I'm using my ultimate.
12803180	12804140	Don't worry.
12804140	12804460	Ow!
12806460	12808140	But you're not even on my side of the map.
12808140	12808940	Wait.
12808940	12810300	Who or what is shooting me?
12810300	12811900	There's, like, something tiny shooting me.
12812700	12813580	I can hear it!
12815420	12815660	Oh.
12817740	12818220	Hold on.
12818780	12819340	Hold on.
12822460	12822940	Hold on.
12823740	12824060	Oh, wait.
12824060	12826780	That doesn't do anything against the new repellent thing.
12826780	12827500	I wish we were there.
12829580	12830060	What?
12831100	12832060	Are we going to do it?
12836620	12837420	Oh, my gosh.
12839420	12841500	I feel like, because we've got Atlas unlocked,
12841500	12843900	we actually might be close to finishing the game.
12843900	12844620	Right.
12844620	12845340	You!
12845340	12846300	Fuck off!
12846300	12847100	Holy crap.
12848620	12849100	Uh.
12850220	12850780	Oh, no.
12851420	12851980	Hold on.
12854060	12855820	Did I just unlock a memory?
12857740	12858460	Uh.
12859820	12866300	We may or may not be in for an absolute heck on earth fight coming up.
12867340	12870380	With an intense amount of enemies.
12870380	12871660	Do you think we can break these doors?
12873900	12876780	I just realized I think I remember this map,
12876780	12878460	and this might be the second blast.
12878460	12878780	Oh, wait.
12878780	12880140	There's a control room.
12880140	12880620	Sorry.
12881580	12881980	There.
12883900	12885980	My dad loved playing this.
12885980	12886220	Is it?
12886220	12888380	If this is the map I think it is,
12888380	12894140	we're about to enter, like, an eight mech fight later on down here.
12895100	12896940	If this is the map I think it is,
12896940	12899020	we're, like, on the second last mission then,
12899020	12901260	because that was his favorite one.
12902140	12903740	I am getting nervous.
12904940	12906140	Have I just remembered?
12906140	12906380	Oh, wait.
12906380	12907820	There's something I'm to destroy back there.
12907820	12908700	My apologies.
12908700	12909100	Sorry.
12914460	12915420	Oh, no.
12915420	12917900	I actually think this may be the second last mission.
12919820	12921180	Uh.
12921180	12921500	Oh, wait.
12921500	12921660	Sorry.
12921660	12922620	I wasn't paying attention.
12923260	12923660	Sorry.
12924460	12925420	Oh, no.
12925420	12926220	I think it is.
12926940	12927260	No.
12927260	12927820	I think it is.
12927820	12928620	It's not sorry.
12928620	12930060	I think it should be done.
12930780	12931660	Am I even going to hit?
12933020	12933260	Nah.
12933260	12934380	It's going to go out of range, bro.
12936700	12937580	Oh, no.
12939340	12941260	If this is the one I think it is,
12941260	12943020	this is going to be a challenge.
12945660	12947660	If I was my dad's favorite map,
12947660	12949820	so surely that means I can do it.
12949820	12950700	My dad's favorite map.
12953180	12955100	I've all the standing spirit this time.
12956540	12956860	Oh.
12957900	12959020	I'm getting ready to get.
12959020	12960380	So, of course, it wouldn't do that.
12961260	12961740	Oh, no.
12964860	12965740	Games hate hate.
12965740	12969900	There's a special there.
12971580	12972460	I think the enemy.
12976060	12976540	Wow.
12978140	12979820	You're the only one that can shoot with that.
12981500	12982860	Oh, another make another make.
12990620	12994700	Oh, that's not.
12994700	12996140	I keep using that again.
12996140	12998300	But that's actually not what I'm supposed to do.
12998300	13001420	See these fucking me bam over the fucking tanks.
13001420	13001900	Oh, my God.
13001900	13002940	They like come out of nowhere.
13002940	13004380	And look at the situation.
13004380	13005180	Like I can't even.
13005900	13009500	I cannot avoid these attacks unless I get lucky like that.
13015260	13015500	Sorry.
13015500	13016380	I'm just using shotgun.
13017900	13019180	You know, don't hit me.
13019180	13019740	Don't hit me.
13019740	13020460	That's so rude.
13020460	13022140	Honestly, it is right there.
13025820	13027740	Members a smart sooner than expected.
13027740	13033260	I mean, if we do it, then yeah, I'll take a cup of tea.
13033260	13034780	I'll get some food, actually.
13034780	13035500	Because I don't want to eat.
13040060	13042060	We got him with their panty loons down.
13042060	13042700	That's right.
13045340	13046620	Getting that lava.
13046620	13048540	I think they can hurt themselves in the lava.
13049980	13052780	Unless it's only me because I'm classic video game.
13053740	13055580	Oh, that's okay.
13055580	13056060	There we go.
13062780	13065580	Well, the good news is you're super close to me.
13068220	13070460	The bad news is I'm overheating like no one's.
13071500	13073420	Oh, they might actually get me.
13073420	13075180	But sorry, I need to play safe.
13076300	13077100	Oh, for goodness sake.
13077100	13080460	He gets so close that I'm like getting cut cut.
13082140	13084860	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
13086860	13087420	Come on.
13087420	13088300	Get that one first.
13088300	13089420	Oh, maybe a double kill.
13092940	13095500	He got damaged so much from that mech blowing up.
13095500	13096300	Feels good, man.
13097420	13098380	Feels good, man.
13098380	13099580	Feels good, man.
13099580	13101020	He got damaged so much.
13103180	13103660	Okay.
13104620	13106300	Much mutual happy.
13106300	13108380	Mutual happy with how that occurred.
13108380	13109580	That came out so well.
13110380	13111020	Oh, okay.
13111020	13111340	Okay.
13111340	13111820	Okay.
13111820	13112300	You ready?
13112300	13112700	You ready?
13118060	13118300	How?
13121340	13123100	No, you're getting sprayed, bro.
13123100	13124700	You're getting sprayed just because of the...
13127020	13127420	Okay.
13128540	13130460	Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
13131740	13132700	Good work.
13132700	13134060	Let's free those villains.
13134060	13136060	Get out of here and find Ragnarok.
13136300	13137420	Calm down with you.
13137420	13138540	Marked and on radar.
13140540	13140860	Okay.
13142140	13143820	I think we're doing a good job.
13147980	13148300	Wow.
13149580	13150780	Good job, man.
13151900	13157260	That's always very satisfying getting a double whammy like that.
13157260	13157580	Right.
13157580	13160460	I'm like getting full up on like all this special stuff.
13161180	13161580	Right.
13161580	13162780	Full health.
13162780	13163900	I'm full on everything.
13164860	13165980	You know, I'm not until...
13165980	13167340	Wait, I need that one.
13171820	13172300	Hold on.
13173580	13173900	Sorry.
13173900	13176220	A little bit bigger than I anticipated.
13178780	13183580	It's too easy for such a gamer pro like me, honestly.
13183580	13185020	You can't, you can't hand...
13185020	13186620	Oh, I'm full on that.
13186620	13188300	Oh, that's the ammo type.
13188300	13188940	Sorry.
13188940	13189660	Is it this one?
13190540	13191580	Am I being a dum-dum?
13192140	13200540	Okay, I re-stocked eight more bullets, but that's okay.
13202140	13203340	It's the energy coil.
13203340	13204300	Is that why they're called?
13205420	13207180	Because you guys are such a nerd.
13208380	13209340	Oh, sorry.
13209340	13210060	This is the one.
13211580	13212300	Whoa.
13212300	13213260	You survived that?
13213820	13214540	I'm surprised.
13216300	13218060	Pleasantly surprised.
13218060	13219660	Not particularly surprised.
13222140	13223020	Wow, I wish that...
13226700	13228060	So this is the map I think is.
13228060	13229740	I'm nervous for what's up ahead,
13230300	13232220	but if it's my dad's favorite map,
13232220	13234460	then truly it can't be that bad, right?
13235340	13237900	Even though my dad was like pretty much number one on this game.
13237900	13239100	Incoming bombers.
13239100	13239820	Watch yourself.
13243900	13244860	What do they do?
13244860	13246780	Oh my god, they're literally fucking...
13246780	13248060	What, are they B-52s?
13248620	13249340	Jeez.
13249340	13250940	You coming back for more or not?
13252540	13254300	I hear a chopper now.
13257340	13258140	You're a chopper.
13259100	13260460	I don't like it.
13260460	13262300	I'm gonna do some of these from afar,
13262300	13264700	because there's a lot of noise ahead.
13266300	13267900	I don't think I'm gonna be doing myself
13267900	13269260	any favors just running in.
13271660	13273580	I'm gonna break that just in case.
13273580	13274380	I'll break this.
13274380	13275020	That's fine.
13275580	13276140	You're fine.
13276540	13283020	I think those are what communicate the hail attack.
13283020	13284140	I'm gonna try that.
13286860	13288140	Oh wow, hold on.
13289500	13291100	Man, I can't destroy everything all at once.
13291100	13292300	Give me a second.
13292300	13293100	Give me a second.
13294380	13294940	Something.
13295820	13297580	I think I just hurt myself by accident.
13298460	13299260	I'm gonna build in.
13299260	13299660	Drat.
13300940	13301660	Drat, drat, drat.
13301660	13302780	That wasn't part of the plan.
13305100	13305580	Oh.
13306380	13307660	That hurt infantry.
13308300	13309340	Imagine being like, oh yeah,
13309340	13311340	by the way, your job is to go against an atlas.
13311340	13311980	An atlas?
13311980	13313500	Call me a deserter.
13313500	13315180	Freaking call me, I don't know.
13315180	13317500	What's the type of deserter?
13317500	13317820	Call me...
13320140	13322220	Wait, why can't I think of one deserter right now?
13324380	13325900	Call me chocolate pudding,
13325900	13327340	because I'm a deserter.
13327340	13327980	Get me out of here.
13328780	13329900	Sorry, that took me so long.
13333260	13334620	I don't know why that was so hard.
13335740	13337820	Watch out for what?
13337820	13339020	Oh, great.
13339020	13341020	I assume there's something special in here.
13342540	13343900	If it was behind a wee paywall,
13343900	13346380	I'd say that as if it wasn't just literally one thing.
13348300	13349500	A strawberry flan.
13349500	13350300	Ice cream.
13350300	13351020	A flan?
13351020	13351420	What's that?
13351420	13352380	A flan?
13352380	13353260	Pancake or this?
13354140	13354940	Oh, sorry, I missed.
13361340	13362460	Yeah, that's what you wrote me.
13363180	13364620	Imagine surviving that back.
13364860	13365340	Cute.
13367260	13367820	Yeah, sorry.
13367820	13369900	I'm going to take every heal I get,
13369900	13372060	because I do not have enough health.
13372060	13372300	Ow.
13373820	13375100	Are you a deserter?
13375100	13376860	Because I terrimis-
13376860	13377900	terrimis-
13377900	13378540	you!
13378540	13379020	Hold on.
13380300	13380620	Oh.
13386060	13387180	I wonder if that does damage
13387180	13388300	if it hits me on the way down.
13391420	13392300	For goodness sake.
13395580	13398540	These tanks are absolutely calling me.
13399820	13401340	Bro, I can't even avoid them.
13402380	13403260	Is that geyser?
13403260	13405180	Is that water geyser to cool me down?
13406380	13407660	I'm not sure how much I cost it.
13407660	13408620	I don't want to stand on it
13408620	13410460	in case it's just a steam cloud.
13413420	13413820	I don't know.
13413820	13415020	You seem like water to me.
13415900	13416380	Oh, my God.
13416380	13417260	Sorry, I'm going to have to swap.
13417260	13420860	These guys are not taking the shotgun shells very well.
13425580	13426460	That's what I'm talking about.
13428220	13428620	Crap.
13429580	13431500	I'm taking some HP damage.
13432540	13433500	I don't think the game-
13434140	13435660	maybe the game does let you go all the way back
13435660	13437100	because your instant's in the map.
13437100	13439500	Like, it's one big map that's been unlocked.
13442940	13444620	Sir, to clear the way for the prisoners,
13444620	13446300	the turrets ahead need to be destroyed.
13446300	13446860	Yes, sir.
13446860	13448940	I've seen so many fixed defenses in one place.
13448940	13450140	Are they pointed the wrong way?
13451660	13453740	I don't know if they're fighting the wrong way.
13453820	13455340	They're seemingly pointed at me.
13457660	13458700	Oh, I can see it.
13459740	13460860	Okay, we got it.
13460860	13461660	Feels good, man.
13461660	13462460	Okay, there's a health.
13468700	13469740	Okay, I think I can see-
13469740	13471900	I was going to say I'm pretty sure that can see me.
13471900	13472380	Oh, no.
13473740	13474380	Thank you.
13474380	13475660	And another one.
13475660	13476300	Thank you.
13478780	13480700	Mech warrior, you should be able to see the camp
13480700	13481500	from where you are.
13481500	13481900	Yeah?
13481900	13483420	Sir, looks like a very light,
13484220	13484940	should be cake.
13486540	13489340	No, that is bait, if I've ever seen it.
13491660	13493500	I do not trust that at all.
13493500	13495100	There is one more thing over there.
13497340	13499500	Yep, there's another, another thing over there.
13499500	13500860	Wait, so what's that supposed to-
13502220	13502860	I can like-
13503820	13505980	Am I supposed to go all the way in a circle?
13505980	13506700	Like, around?
13509660	13510780	Please don't worry if you're-
13510780	13512380	Like, I cannot see what you're shooting at.
13512380	13514220	I promise you, I can hardly see either.
13514220	13515580	The crosshair is going red,
13515580	13517580	which means the AI is locked on,
13517580	13518380	so I'm just-
13519340	13522220	I am just taking it as it comey come comes.
13523100	13524780	Yeah, it's literally a trap.
13524780	13525420	I'm sorry, but-
13526300	13527740	There's only a light thing.
13527740	13528780	Yeah, I don't believe it.
13532380	13534220	Oh, I thought I should be able-
13539180	13540780	Take it easy, easy.
13542620	13543100	I'm even-
13545580	13546220	Yeah.
13546220	13547340	Okay, we made it down.
13549020	13550860	Nice and safe, nice and friendly.
13550860	13552540	There's no more turrets coming at us.
13553900	13555660	Um, we'll maybe take a few-
13555660	13557180	Oh, of course.
13557180	13559900	Oh, of course the HUD was telling us the truth.
13559900	13562060	Open the gates and defend the civilians.
13562060	13562620	Oh, yes.
13565180	13566460	I look very much like you.
13570060	13571900	I'm to defend civilians.
13572860	13574460	Why did that give me three?
13576060	13576540	Fuck.
13578140	13579420	Why did that give me three?
13584460	13584960	Oh.
13586460	13586960	Oh.
13595180	13596460	Atlas, okay.
13596460	13597500	Okay, where?
13597500	13597980	Where?
13597980	13598300	Where?
13598300	13599900	Right side, right side, right side on the HUD.
13600860	13602860	Scream down, scream down.
13602860	13604140	I have heavy ammo.
13609180	13610620	It's fine, it's fine.
13610620	13614060	We are over-keying, but we're just going to keep on at it.
13615740	13617100	Okay, we're just going to keep on at it.
13618300	13620300	Why is that Atlas got special moveset?
13622780	13623740	Okay, okay.
13625180	13625820	Cool down.
13627100	13627740	Cool down.
13627740	13628220	Let this-
13628220	13629500	Let this Atlas cool down.
13630460	13631340	We're going to go next.
13632060	13633020	We're going to pick up the health.
13633020	13634060	We're full health again.
13635500	13636780	Sir, watch yourself.
13636780	13639180	The drop ship's returning and it's hot-dropping another mech.
13640220	13640860	Uh-huh.
13640860	13643260	Please be another Atlas, because I can handle an Atlas.
13644060	13647580	I think it's a Ragnarok, considering how long this cutscene is going for.
13649180	13649500	No.
13650140	13651980	It's too Atlas-y!
13651980	13656620	Oh my god, when two Atlas do together, they become Atlas-y, like, uh, stuff.
13656620	13659100	Oh, oh lord, I do not like this.
13660780	13662460	And there's so many bunkers in my way.
13662460	13664220	Okay, that's why they gave me two health.
13664220	13668060	I'm going to slowly worm my way back to the two health bits,
13669180	13670780	as I destroy all the buildings in the way.
13670780	13671500	Sorry, my bad.
13672140	13673500	My bad, I'm just healing.
13673500	13675500	Okay, there are two health to my left now.
13675500	13676300	I feel okay.
13677100	13679900	I feel like we're melting this guy pretty adequately.
13679900	13680940	He is getting low.
13681980	13685180	And maybe we can get a double kill if he goes down and hurts him.
13685740	13686780	Oh, come on, hurt him.
13687740	13690300	Oh, shit, I did not need to take that one.
13691020	13691500	Okay.
13692860	13695100	Did he take any damage for that?
13695100	13696380	Oh, I don't think so.
13696940	13698620	Okay, we can't shoot each other over the wall.
13700700	13702620	He's, you're not shooting this.
13702620	13703820	Okay, now you are.
13703820	13706780	So, I can't shoot over the wall, but he can shoot over the wall.
13706780	13707740	Yeah, sounds a bit rude.
13708620	13709580	Have I got any extra?
13709580	13711260	No, I accidentally picked up both of them.
13711260	13713260	Oh.
13713660	13719660	Oh, he's limping.
13719660	13720860	Oh, I'm gone.
13726860	13728140	Look at the goods, though.
13730140	13731660	Look at the goods, though.
13734220	13736940	Eh, look at the goods, though, that drop from atlases.
13737900	13738780	Or atlasi.
13739500	13740700	Any atlasi, enjoy.
13742140	13742700	Hey, back.
13743660	13745660	A high-ranking, oh, sorry.
13746860	13747740	Prevent escape.
13751980	13752940	I think we're doing it.
13757500	13759660	Did I win the e-mech fight without realizing?
13761100	13764060	When you two atlasi come together to make a baby atlas.
13765020	13767500	Does this count now as three or is it more like a wasting?
13767500	13768380	I have no idea.
13769100	13770940	It was the repair yard.
13770940	13772140	We're on payback.
13772220	13773900	What's payback?
13773900	13776860	Is it like, this isn't the last mission.
13776860	13778860	I remember the look of the last mission.
13779500	13781900	Shawnee, they sat with extreme prejudice.
13781900	13783260	You know what you must do.
13787180	13789180	Random questions, you still want to hold it?
13789180	13790060	Naturally.
13790060	13792140	I can't believe that freaking got 50k views.
13792140	13792780	That's insane.
13794380	13795820	Honestly, I didn't expect that.
13797020	13799660	Shawnee taking on eight guys without breaking a sweat.
13799660	13801820	All I'm seeing is that recording booth.
13802620	13803980	The ASMR booth, sorry.
13805340	13809660	Payback, a high-ranking war of battlefields.
13817020	13819180	And one of the vehicles in the convoy.
13820540	13822860	Okay, this might require a few attempts.
13822860	13826940	I don't recall that magma gonna break and hurt me.
13832780	13834460	Don't be distracted.
13834460	13835580	Only one thing matters.
13836380	13837340	Watch school for it.
13842860	13845020	This convoy, this entire convoy.
13846140	13848300	Wait, I don't have enough HP for this.
13850220	13851180	Am I being silly?
13854620	13855500	Am I being silly?
13855500	13856060	Am I being silly?
13857340	13859820	Now you can have it up to you to fly into the lava.
13859820	13860700	That would be great.
13860780	13863340	They're all in catapult heavy mags.
13863340	13864860	To be sure you get the second to command,
13864860	13866380	you'll need to knock them all out.
13866380	13867980	Okay, so I'm to kill them.
13869740	13870780	First mag down.
13871900	13874460	Take up his health and then spray spray.
13876860	13877900	Uh, sure.
13879980	13881260	That's not even locking on.
13881900	13884060	Wait, I'm getting a blary is...
13885740	13886380	Hold on.
13886380	13887820	What are the tactics for this?
13888780	13890060	Is there tactics?
13890060	13891420	Is there really healing up here?
13893180	13893500	Huh?
13896780	13897740	I basically...
13897740	13898540	Well, I need to...
13898540	13899420	Oh, wow.
13899420	13899980	Holy crap.
13899980	13902300	The AI is, like, ready to lock on.
13903660	13904140	Oh, dear.
13904140	13905500	I think we're gonna need a strategy.
13909260	13909580	Oh!
13913420	13915100	I think this might be the strategy.
13918780	13920300	Uh...
13920300	13920780	Oh, yeah.
13924620	13924940	Okay.
13926140	13926860	We've got one.
13928460	13929740	Oh, there's health down there.
13930780	13932220	I don't want to get too greedy now.
13933340	13934460	I can let them pass.
13934460	13934780	Oh!
13937340	13938060	Did we do it?
13938940	13940060	By accident?
13940060	13941100	I think we did.
13941100	13942780	Okay, let's go get some health.
13942780	13944700	I think that would be the way to move right now
13944700	13946300	is to grab all these boobies.
13947820	13949980	Thank goodness I stopped, like, try hard on the target.
13949980	13951180	Right, let's catch up a bit.
13951180	13952220	He's a wee bit ahead.
13958620	13960860	Sir, the word of Blake is in full retreat.
13960860	13963260	Like amateurs, they've probably left something useful.
13963980	13964220	Yeah.
13965260	13965660	Oh, yeah.
13967180	13967660	Hold on.
13971980	13973180	Is this fine?
13973180	13973820	Yeah, okay.
13973820	13976220	They do not have much health against an atlas like this.
13977820	13979260	Bro, just accept it.
13979260	13980140	You're getting wrecked.
13982140	13983580	Oh, there's something going for me at the left.
13983580	13984300	I don't know what it is.
13984300	13985100	It's not amazing.
13988860	13991420	Sirs, I'm reading multiple signatures.
13991420	13993740	It looks like another convoy.
13993740	13994300	Oh.
13994300	13996700	Foster, when you looked at the sensors the first time,
13996700	13999580	you missed a group of massive walking tanks.
14000860	14002540	Get a move on and stop that other group.
14002540	14004940	I love how cheeky they are to each other.
14004940	14007500	You missed a group of walking tanks?
14007820	14009900	I mean, honestly, she's pretty justified
14009900	14011020	for saying it like that.
14011020	14013580	Like, what do you mean you missed a group?
14013580	14014540	One of those mechs.
14014540	14015340	Keep after them, sir.
14015340	14015580	What?
14015580	14016620	There's so many enemies.
14017900	14019500	Is there supplies up here?
14019500	14020060	Is that why?
14021180	14022620	I think there may be supplies.
14022620	14023420	Let's see if we can get them.
14026540	14028620	Oh, of course they take these pretty much.
14029420	14031260	They're silly of me to assume other guys.
14032460	14033100	Okay, boom.
14034380	14037020	And then let's find all the good things in here.
14038780	14039580	Quite a few.
14044540	14046460	You, actually, I don't use rockets.
14050220	14051340	I think we're doing it.
14051340	14055740	I don't want to drink it, but I think we're doing it.
14058300	14059580	Okay, we've got full health.
14061260	14063100	That's B. Your target?
14063100	14064220	This is tamed.
14064220	14065500	You stop that right now.
14065500	14066140	You stop that.
14066140	14066940	You're trolling me.
14067020	14067820	It's not tamed.
14067820	14069020	Don't say such horrible things.
14070380	14070700	Oh, wait.
14070700	14072140	It must be supposed to be up or down right now.
14072140	14072620	I don't know.
14072620	14073100	Oh, fuck it.
14073100	14073820	It says go this way.
14073820	14074460	I'm going this way.
14075740	14076700	They're getting away.
14076700	14077500	Stop!
14077500	14077980	Stop!
14077980	14079020	You're scaring me.
14079020	14079820	I'm in an atlas.
14079820	14080380	I'm so slow.
14080380	14081820	I can't even fly.
14081820	14084060	No, it's another get the convoy for the getaway mission.
14084060	14084380	Drat!
14084940	14085180	Right.
14085180	14086780	At least we know to destroy the bridge.
14087420	14089580	And then I'll pick up whatever they drop.
14090700	14091900	Okay, there is a fight.
14091900	14092780	That's what I want to hear.
14092780	14094140	That's exactly what I want to hear.
14095180	14096460	I actually want a fight
14096460	14098300	because I need my stuff a little bit.
14099740	14100140	Okay.
14100780	14101260	Okay.
14102540	14103500	You're flying.
14103500	14105100	You're flying.
14105100	14105900	You're flying.
14107500	14108300	You're flying.
14115180	14116380	You get too close,
14116380	14118060	but I want to pick up the kiddies.
14119980	14121420	Okay, then we go next.
14122380	14123500	Next convoy.
14123500	14124460	Are they up there?
14124460	14125820	Oh, please tell me they're not up there.
14126700	14128380	Why would you do something to me like this?
14128380	14129500	How am I supposed to get off?
14129500	14130220	I'm not going back.
14133100	14135900	I haven't even unlocked Wild Card and Bind and Avis.
14135900	14137260	Like I'm like 99% sure
14137260	14139420	because I've never had, came across one yet.
14139420	14141020	I'll show you what my save file looks like
14141020	14141900	in the Bind and Avis.
14144060	14145820	You guys can be the judge.
14146780	14147820	That's why in November,
14147820	14149020	you guys are actually going to help me
14149020	14150060	fill the unlocks I need.
14150620	14153420	I think we might do one Eden run
14153420	14155180	on the Bind and Avis stream.
14155180	14157500	And then I want to play Lilith's read mode.
14157500	14161020	Some people absolutely despise read mode.
14161020	14162620	I actually quite like it.
14163420	14165180	I find it quite fun,
14165180	14167580	but only if it goes well, obviously.
14167740	14171500	Mercenaries, you will force me to abandon this world
14171500	14173020	and all it hides.
14173020	14175420	For that, you will face death.
14176460	14179180	Foster, can the Icarus get us off this rock yet?
14179180	14179820	No, sir.
14179820	14181260	Just local hops.
14181260	14183020	Captain, return to the Icarus.
14183020	14183420	We're going to-
14183420	14183900	Was this?
14183900	14185260	Oh, I almost lost.
14185260	14186380	This is the end of the map.
14186380	14187100	Holy crap.
14187100	14187660	Oh, my God.
14189500	14189980	Whoops.
14191500	14193420	I honestly don't mind read mode.
14193420	14195980	Who despised read mode is really hard.
14196060	14198540	Begin our best interest to capture whatever lost technology
14198540	14200140	is being evacuated with him.
14200140	14201660	Assault space port.
14201660	14202860	Someone has to go into a heavily guarded space port,
14202860	14204140	blow the Blake drop ship,
14204140	14206140	and kill or strand straighter.
14206140	14207580	Guess who gets the job?
14207580	14208300	Not it.
14208300	14209980	Right, you are a briefing boy.
14209980	14211260	Good luck, Captain.
14211260	14212620	Foster, your job.
14212620	14214300	You need to get the drop ship fixed
14214300	14216940	so we can get off this planet and enjoy our R&R,
14216940	14218780	after our esteemed captain gets done.
14218780	14219980	That has like a billion enemies in it.
14219980	14221500	As soon as you unlock the Atlas, Lilith,
14221500	14224140	it's not too, it's not too tricky.
14224140	14225020	Two more missions.
14226140	14226620	Oh, my God.
14226620	14227980	We're beating the game journalist.
14231660	14233020	We're beating the game journalist.
14233020	14233420	Let's go.
14235980	14237420	Is the game sent me the wrong way?
14238620	14239100	No.
14239100	14239900	I'm being pranked.
14241340	14241740	Clearly.
14246380	14247740	You're blowing it right now.
14247740	14249580	Can I get across this one first, please?
14254460	14255340	Okay, now.
14256140	14257740	I saw my life flash before my eyes.
14262380	14262940	Oh, my God.
14265020	14266540	Is this another timed mission?
14266540	14267100	Yes or no?
14268060	14269500	That would have time to be fucking around
14269500	14270460	and destroying stuff.
14271820	14272940	Oh, they have full health.
14273580	14275100	Man, this game is short.
14275100	14277020	Older games tend to be like that,
14277020	14278780	although I think Conker's Bad Party
14278780	14281340	is the only game that was like old AF,
14281340	14283260	and it was like took so long to do.
14283260	14285020	I mean, I've never completed it.
14285020	14286780	I used to play the same mission as a child
14286780	14288620	and then get stuck at the exact same spot,
14288620	14291340	which honestly, that game was wildly inappropriate for me,
14291340	14293340	inappropriate for me to be playing as a child,
14293340	14296780	but hey, it gave me a personality,
14296780	14300060	so I can't actually say anything bad against it.
14302460	14304380	I'd actually be so boring if I didn't game.
14305020	14307740	I don't even think I would have anything to say to them.
14307740	14310780	I'd probably be like a mukbang type of person
14312940	14314460	and just watch people eat food all day.
14314460	14317820	I'd be like, oh yeah, this is time for it again.
14321820	14323420	You're so in my face.
14327500	14331500	No, no, okay, let's go again.
14332940	14335580	Oh, okay, let's go again.
14335580	14336940	Again, again, again, again, again, again.
14336940	14339260	That was my humble mistake.
14339260	14340700	That was my humble mistake.
14340700	14341820	I do apologize.
14342380	14344540	Literally went for a cheeky dip in the thing.
14346380	14349260	The only thing that can kill me is myself.
14349260	14350700	I am back to the video game.
14351580	14353580	Okay, I need to sprint across the bridge
14353580	14355180	because they're going to blow it up.
14355180	14357100	I cannot believe I just did that.
14357100	14359260	Into the flaming hot Cheetos.
14359260	14360780	Literally, what an air.
14362620	14365820	I can't believe I successfully managed that as hilarious.
14367820	14369100	I'm so energy-honored.
14369820	14373340	I don't know how I'm not in some e-sports team.
14373340	14373820	Is that good?
14375340	14377180	Not only am I terrible at the game.
14381340	14382220	Let's try that again.
14382780	14384860	This time, no perish.
14386540	14387180	I'm pretty cheeky.
14387180	14389260	Speaking, talking about hot sprang.
14391020	14392620	Yeah, Conqueror's had Inuit on it.
14392620	14396780	I, the childhood memory for me playing Conqueror's Bad Friday
14396780	14398620	is bouncing on that sunflowers.
14399500	14400300	Nothing else.
14400300	14402860	I used to do it for minutes at a time.
14402860	14405340	And then whenever I could hear my mom or dad come into the room,
14405340	14409020	I'd get off them because I'd be scared they'd be mad at me.
14409020	14411020	And they'd be like, what are you doing, strongy?
14416140	14417180	Right, do not fall.
14417180	14418380	Whoa, you idle.
14419740	14421020	They had a funny little ha-ha.
14425020	14425660	Oh, jeez.
14426220	14428220	Everything's got an HP up there.
14430300	14432220	You're not actually supposed to get stronger.
14432220	14433180	You should get weaker.
14435980	14438060	Right, do not fall off the map with time.
14438060	14440540	Even if the mix gets all the way in my face.
14442380	14445020	Oh my god, it's so fast compared to me.
14445020	14447740	I think, oh my god, such a fast mix.
14447740	14448380	Please stop.
14449020	14449900	Please, I beg you.
14450540	14451180	Give me a gun.
14454140	14455980	Yeah, I don't think going invisible at this stage
14455980	14457500	won't do anything for you, buddy.
14457500	14459260	Please do not drop your guns on them.
14461980	14463340	Is there anything else here?
14463340	14464540	Or is this just like a...
14468540	14470380	I am the great mate even.
14472860	14473980	Oh, is this a dead end?
14473980	14475420	OK, so I have to go that way.
14475420	14477340	Maybe we can get a few licks in though.
14477340	14477980	Yeah, we can.
14478940	14479820	Look at that.
14479820	14480540	That was a good lick.
14481980	14483020	That was a good lick.
14483020	14484300	Something, something red there.
14484300	14484780	Let's get it.
14486780	14488220	I love doing stuff from a distance.
14489580	14490940	I'd save some of our HP.
14492140	14493900	I hate the Dracula.
14494780	14496940	I never got to that stage as a child.
14496940	14498540	I unlocked the Sunflower,
14498540	14500540	and then I think after that I was just like,
14500540	14502460	I couldn't progress because I didn't know what was going on.
14503980	14505260	OK, there's a lava flume.
14505820	14507500	I guess I will love it.
14508140	14510140	I will allow a lava flume.
14510140	14510780	Just one, though.
14511580	14514700	There shall be no other lava flumming near me.
14514700	14515260	Oh, OK.
14515260	14516540	Well, that's illegal to do that.
14519020	14520460	Am I to destroy this?
14520460	14522220	Gain access to the spaceport.
14523900	14524460	OK, is it?
14525980	14526860	Aren't you at me?
14529420	14529980	Space...
14530700	14531260	Space...
14531260	14533020	I want to do a cheeky U-turn.
14534780	14535820	Cheeky U-turn moment.
14538540	14539100	Nah.
14539100	14540700	I hate when they get a lick on me when I'm...
14543340	14544620	The 80s, what do you mean?
14545740	14547820	Way too distracted by Sunflower Booba.
14547820	14550700	I did the pitchfork in Bunker's...
14550700	14552060	Bunker's Kites for...
14553100	14554780	Conqueror's Bad Ferdy.
14554780	14557180	I did the pitchfork inside the hay bale.
14558060	14560860	I did the Booba Sunflower,
14560860	14562620	and then after that I just kinda...
14562620	14563660	Like, I did the wasp.
14565260	14566220	I did the bull,
14566220	14567260	and then after the bull,
14567260	14568620	I think I got stuck in the bale.
14568620	14569900	I actually don't know how to progress,
14569900	14571180	so you guys don't have to hold my hand
14571180	14572780	when we get that game shot.
14573500	14575420	I don't know if we can get achievements for it,
14575420	14576940	because it's on rare replay,
14577820	14580540	but I don't know how the achievements work in that game.
14581340	14585500	Obviously, this is made before achievements really were a thing.
14587020	14587980	Entertuality.
14588540	14589020	Hold on.
14590940	14592940	I'm trying to, like, rotate between both...
14593820	14594320	Eh.
14595660	14598060	The missiles and the shotgun.
14598060	14599580	It seems to be very efficient,
14599580	14600700	which I'm quite happy with.
14605260	14605760	Take...
14607820	14608320	Woah!
14609100	14610220	Those are low keys!
14611100	14612620	They're so fucking skinny!
14613660	14615740	And, oh god, they have such high mobility.
14615740	14617260	This shouldn't be awful.
14617260	14618380	But they have low health.
14618380	14619340	That's my benefit.
14619340	14620060	They have low health.
14623900	14625580	I love when they just take it,
14625580	14626860	like a good little mech.
14626860	14628300	Honestly, you're such a good mech.
14631020	14632700	They double killed each other!
14634540	14635500	Oh my god.
14635500	14637020	I love when they take it, sorry,
14637020	14638860	but, like, literally,
14638860	14640220	this is the best feeling ever.
14645020	14645900	Two for one.
14645900	14647660	Yeah, their HP is literally so low.
14653020	14654300	Okay, blow up the tunnel.
14654300	14655100	Got it.
14655100	14655740	Or the bridge.
14655740	14656460	I don't know what one.
14657740	14658380	Then the bridge?
14661100	14662140	I just waste this one.
14662140	14663660	I know it doesn't do as much damage,
14663660	14664540	but I don't want to, like,
14665900	14667580	waste my good ammo on it.
14673180	14674460	If you like more old games,
14674460	14675180	and then good game,
14675980	14676860	good old games,
14676860	14677580	it's, like, for steam,
14677580	14678940	but some obscure stuff.
14678940	14679580	Mmm.
14679580	14681500	Their problem is I can only play games
14681500	14683260	that I've had experience before,
14683260	14684220	or seen be played,
14685740	14687660	which is why I play games like Mech Assault,
14687660	14688940	because I've seen my dad play it
14688940	14690460	like a million times over.
14692460	14693420	Oh, there's health there.
14695500	14697420	Oh, and there's a helicopter coming.
14697420	14698140	Oh, there.
14698140	14698460	Sorry.
14699500	14700380	I'm using the HUD,
14700380	14701500	and then looking at the same time,
14701500	14702780	which is the cause of me being there.
14703340	14703580	Oh, no.
14709580	14710300	Gee.
14710300	14711660	I just picked the health up.
14711660	14712860	Give me a second to do that.
14713980	14715980	And your dad's in school.
14715980	14717740	He plays mostly mobile games.
14717740	14720380	He tried to get into Starcraft for a bit.
14720380	14721340	He got in the floor,
14721340	14722860	so he doesn't game that much,
14722860	14724540	but we're going to play another game
14724540	14725980	called Halo Wars.
14725980	14728380	He was fucking addicted to that shit.
14728380	14729740	Holy crap.
14729740	14730940	He can get enough of it.
14731900	14734620	And the difficulty can increase,
14735260	14738220	and he got to a stupid, silly number
14738220	14739100	and difficulty,
14739100	14740220	which is honestly insane.
14741020	14742540	Oh, my God, Halo Wars.
14742540	14744780	Yeah, you guys have played Halo Wars, too.
14746780	14748540	I'm not going to lie, Reefland.
14748540	14750140	You'd get along with my dad very well.
14752460	14753580	He was addicted to it,
14753580	14755420	so we're definitely going to give Halo Wars a bash,
14755420	14757100	but it's quite long.
14757100	14758380	If I remember correctly,
14758380	14759260	it's a long game.
14759260	14760460	It's not like a...
14760460	14762060	I think it may even be a two-streamer.
14764620	14765420	Nope, I missed.
14769260	14769820	No!
14770860	14771420	I got him.
14773180	14773580	Uh...
14775100	14776460	Okay, there is a health spot.
14776460	14777020	I think...
14777820	14778780	I don't need it right now.
14778780	14779660	I'm actually still health.
14779660	14780300	I mean...
14781420	14785180	My dad has quite literally taught me
14785180	14787020	everything I needed to know about this game.
14787900	14790540	Okay, the doors are open.
14792540	14793420	Is this a fight?
14793420	14794620	If I've ever seen one,
14794620	14796140	it certainly looks like it.
14799100	14800140	I think we'll try and talk.
14801580	14803500	There's something going on over here.
14803500	14804300	I don't like it.
14805180	14806060	Is it a plan?
14806780	14807820	There's quite a few...
14807820	14809340	Oh, it's that building there.
14809340	14810620	Okay, I see it.
14810620	14811260	Hold on.
14811260	14812220	Let's get rid of it now.
14813340	14814940	We don't have problems.
14814940	14816860	Okay, that's what we want to see.
14817980	14818860	Take your time.
14818860	14819500	Take your time.
14820540	14821660	Time is on our side.
14821660	14822540	Health is on our side.
14822540	14823340	We don't need to be...
14824460	14826700	Going absolutely fast as far as I'm aware.
14828220	14829820	Unless maybe we do have enough.
14829820	14830380	Oh, there is.
14832620	14834620	We are over keeping quite nasty.
14837260	14840780	Did my dad ever try Warcraft?
14840780	14842620	I don't think so.
14842620	14843740	He tried Starcraft.
14843740	14845340	He got into a wee bit,
14845420	14847420	but I wasn't saying he went MLG crazy.
14851580	14854140	But he doesn't really game that much these days
14854140	14855180	because of his work,
14855180	14859500	but I'm hoping I can retire him next year.
14860060	14862060	So, obviously,
14862060	14864700	I've got quite a lot of motivational factors.
14864700	14867740	Like, the girls motivate me to work hard.
14867740	14869660	Like, my dad motivates me to work hard.
14869660	14871820	But like, in the nicest way,
14872780	14875580	like, if my dad wasn't cool with me gaming,
14875580	14877820	like, you guys tell me stories about your parents
14877820	14879180	kind of being a bit obtuse,
14879180	14882060	like, when you like, game or whatever.
14882060	14886140	If my dad wasn't like, cool enough to get into Xbox
14886140	14887820	and like, get online and all of that,
14887820	14889100	like, I wouldn't be a gamer.
14889100	14890460	I'd probably be like,
14890460	14892220	Ew, ew, makeup!
14892220	14892780	Ew, ew!
14893660	14896300	Oh, I love going out to nightclubs
14896300	14897980	and grinding on people.
14897980	14899020	Oh, like,
14899740	14902140	So, I do feel like, oh, my dad or whatever,
14902140	14902780	how it came up.
14902780	14903820	Like, my mom as well,
14903820	14905580	she never had any issues with gaming
14905580	14906540	because my dad's game,
14906540	14907980	so my mom was like, well, I don't,
14907980	14908780	I couldn't get to...
14911260	14911760	Oh?
14921980	14922480	Uh...
14924620	14925660	I don't remember that.
14929580	14930080	Okay.
14933260	14935260	Take it, take it, take it.
14935260	14935980	Yep, that's right.
14935980	14937100	Ooh, ooh, ooh.
14937100	14938220	Give him everything I got.
14939580	14940060	Come on.
14940780	14941820	Come on, buddy.
14941820	14942300	Parish.
14943340	14944140	That's all we'll see.
14944140	14944700	Right, you're next.
14947420	14948460	Okay, that's all I want to see.
14948460	14949260	That's all I want to see.
14950220	14950780	Come on.
14952220	14953020	Oh, look.
14953020	14955180	Yeah, if you have an invisible guy,
14955180	14955740	if you shoot,
14955740	14957740	he becomes less invisible in the multiplayer.
14957740	14958380	Whoa!
14958380	14959580	Not what we want to see.
14959580	14960060	Hold on.
14960700	14961980	Let's get rid of this building.
14961980	14962780	Not what we want to see.
14962780	14964620	We don't want him to respawn on enemies.
14966140	14966620	Come on.
14967180	14967980	There we go.
14967980	14968460	There we go.
14968460	14969180	We don't want that.
14969180	14969660	We don't want that.
14972140	14974540	Unfortunately, I'm very, uh...
14976140	14976780	Overkeating.
14978540	14981180	And these guys move left to right so quickly.
14981900	14983100	Oh, God, please hurt him.
14984140	14984380	Oh!
14985820	14986940	Oh, that's a...
14986940	14988860	I need to change that to my donal sound.
14988860	14990460	The sound of them exploding
14990460	14992380	is just like such a good sound effect.
14992380	14993100	Like, shaw.
14994700	14995420	That is so good.
14995980	14996620	Let's get rid of you.
14997980	14999260	Uh, looks like...
14999820	15000700	Oh, there we go.
15000700	15000940	Right.
15002380	15003340	Mama Dad gamed a bit,
15003340	15004780	but he stopped less the time going on.
15004780	15007100	Oh, my mom was like a Lara Croft e-girl.
15007100	15008140	She loves Lara Croft.
15008940	15010140	She loves the movies as well.
15010140	15012060	We should watch Lara Croft movies for my mom,
15012060	15014540	because I feel at home with it like I don't.
15014540	15015500	I need to do what again?
15016460	15017260	Shit!
15017260	15018300	I spoke over it.
15019100	15019660	The doors?
15022700	15023260	I don't know.
15023820	15024220	Oh, shit.
15025660	15026540	What am I to do?
15026540	15026940	Hello?
15027580	15029580	Then you make us all players a little bit of attention.
15030540	15030860	This?
15032220	15032620	Shit.
15035180	15036220	Doors can't be blown.
15038380	15039820	What, you calling yourself a door?
15039820	15041340	Calling yourself a challenge for me?
15041340	15041980	Am I being dumb?
15046460	15048460	Camera pan to the generators.
15048460	15049420	Find another way.
15049420	15051820	Okay, as long as we're not on a timed mission, right?
15052460	15054540	Haha, what if we're on a timed mission right now?
15055500	15056940	I was fucking around trying to look for...
15060380	15063420	Lara Croft and Joy are in a multiplayer mech assault smack talker.
15066300	15067020	When you guys are like,
15067020	15068140	uh, is your dad single?
15068140	15069180	Is your mom single?
15069180	15069500	No!
15070380	15071660	They're a gaming jewel!
15072460	15075900	And they have happy marriage.
15077100	15078780	And they have happy daughters.
15079580	15080860	And all is good in the world.
15080860	15081900	Oh, I see the generator.
15084380	15086780	I wonder if I, if I broke that before.
15087660	15089100	Would it have standard?
15090380	15091980	Is there a daughter single?
15092780	15094060	Do you want to meet my parents?
15094780	15096940	Would you be nervous if I brought them on stream?
15099340	15100700	Okay, now let's go fuck them up.
15102140	15103420	Bring my parents on stream.
15103420	15103980	Go to the...
15106060	15108140	We officially cannot hit on stories.
15108140	15110060	Do not hit on my mom and dad!
15111020	15111740	Honestly.
15113820	15115580	Do they want to be adopted?
15115580	15116860	Do you want to be my stepbrother?
15117820	15121420	Do you already know what kind of things I'm into?
15121420	15123100	Are you sure you want to be my stepbrother?
15125980	15127660	Yeah, I'll have you know what I created, I mean.
15128060	15131500	I don't think it happened.
15131500	15133580	Things would happen if you became my stepbrother.
15135820	15137420	Oh yeah, okay, okay.
15138540	15139740	All right, let's see what's going on.
15139740	15142140	Okay, the base doors just closed, which I don't like.
15142140	15144460	I'll bet that plane is loaded with goodness.
15144460	15147580	Destroy the drop ship or it can take off.
15147580	15151900	Well, considering you've locked me into a cut scene,
15151900	15153900	you know, it's really getting away, I have to admit.
15154620	15155660	It's really getting away.
15158620	15159900	Okay, I think that's it.
15159900	15160940	I didn't have much for it.
15161500	15163100	I'm like, hold on, there's an enemy.
15163740	15164620	Hold on, base.
15174540	15175420	Okay, hold on.
15175420	15177100	I think we're going to have to try hard a little bit.
15178700	15180700	Maybe we do a little bit of sweating.
15180700	15182540	Hold on, hold on, a little bit of sweating.
15183260	15184060	Just a wee bit.
15185020	15187100	Maybe, oh no, that's a terrible good one again.
15187100	15188060	Oh, and a clue.
15190780	15192060	I feel like he's so weak.
15192620	15193740	Oh, no, he's weak.
15193740	15194780	He's freaking glowing.
15197820	15200460	Wow, okay, that was good.
15200460	15200860	Bye.
15204380	15205820	Hot heals, I got the H.
15207500	15209340	There seems to be something up here.
15209740	15210220	Oh, hi there.
15213340	15214380	Whoa, the texture.
15215020	15216060	I don't know what it is.
15217500	15218460	I'm shooting at it anyway.
15224060	15225660	Definitely not having a lever.
15229660	15231180	Let's see if he can do the bit.
15232620	15236220	In the Disney music scene, I can do the bit.
15236860	15238300	Right, so this is just an end.
15238300	15240300	Okay, I am definitely not good at it.
15241660	15243100	What is going on over here?
15245580	15247180	I'd be nervous to meet my gran.
15248540	15249900	No, they shouldn't send love to you,
15249900	15251660	but I feel like she would be the protective one.
15253180	15255660	My gran's dead, so you don't have to worry about my gran?
15257740	15260300	Yeah, you don't need to worry about her approval.
15260300	15262860	She popped her cogs, so you're fine, Riflin.
15265180	15266860	Oh, that's funny as fuck.
15269180	15273580	Oh, honestly, it was just like, I'm like,
15273580	15276140	did I see it or did I just let it go?
15276140	15277740	I'm like, nah, that's actually kind of funny.
15279500	15281100	Oh, shit, here we go, here we go.
15281900	15282700	Oh, I'm so sorry.
15282700	15283660	Nah, don't worry about it.
15284940	15286460	It's not as painful.
15286460	15287580	Oh, shit, I'm going to miss it.
15287580	15288700	There's the dropship.
15288700	15289100	Kill it.
15289100	15289900	Wait, what?
15289900	15291020	What you saw, straighter?
15292380	15292780	What?
15295660	15297980	Nah, it was like Solar's fuck to talk about it.
15299100	15301420	Mercenary scum, you'll die now.
15301420	15303100	You'll face Ragnarok.
15304300	15305340	What is that?
15305340	15307420	That's not in any of our technical readouts.
15307420	15309100	Oh, my God, it's the Ragnarok.
15312220	15313660	Oh, my God, that's right.
15313660	15315340	His ultimate is invincibility.
15317260	15318380	Oh, my God.
15318380	15321020	Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
15321020	15322300	I completely forgot.
15322300	15322940	I forgot.
15323580	15324380	Holy shit.
15324380	15325420	I forgot everything.
15325420	15326140	Just send everything.
15326860	15327660	Call the guards.
15327660	15328300	Call the guards.
15329180	15330700	Oh, my God.
15330700	15333500	Oh, my God, he's fucking annihilating me for another day.
15334460	15334940	Oh, my God.
15337100	15337820	Show mercy.
15339260	15340380	Show mercy, Modis.
15340380	15341500	Show me mercy, Modis.
15341500	15344380	Oh, my God, his ultimate is that freaking three rocket attack.
15346140	15347660	I know he's got technology.
15347660	15348060	We haven't.
15358380	15359980	See you in hell, strainer.
15361340	15362060	Sorry, sirs.
15362060	15363580	Couldn't help myself.
15363580	15364940	Well done, Captain.
15364940	15367820	At least now we know what Ragnarok is, or it was.
15368460	15372460	Sir, too bad we couldn't capture it and analyze it.
15372460	15373980	Sir, what?
15373980	15375420	Look at the feet from the cameras.
15376060	15377180	Whoa, they had two?
15377820	15379180	Foster, send in the tech.
15379180	15381100	Oh, I thought I had to do a double fight there.
15381100	15381980	I was getting scared.
15381980	15383740	We need to stop the Stoom's Day device
15383740	15385180	and save this world.
15385740	15386460	Oh, thank God.
15391260	15391980	Oh, my God.
15393980	15395900	I thought we were going to have to do a second fight.
15395900	15397900	I was like, I'm wasting 50% health.
15402940	15403660	Ready to roll.
15415180	15417820	Oh, man, all of us are depending on you.
15417820	15419020	Got anything to add, Foster?
15419660	15421580	Drinks on me when you get back?
15421580	15422140	Good man.
15424860	15427180	OK, Ragnarok.
15427180	15429900	The Ragnarok is a unique prototype
15429900	15434780	built using Loth Tech to provide massive stopping power.
15436860	15437260	Wow.
15441100	15442540	Look at that swagger.
15445260	15446860	OK, let's see what we're dealing with.
15447900	15450700	OK, we've got sniper bullets, rockets.
15455580	15456620	Wait, and then...
15458700	15460060	Wait, then how do I get big...
15461580	15462220	How do I do the...
15464860	15465980	Wait, how do I do that?
15465980	15466460	Do that again.
15472700	15473660	What's the red?
15476060	15477900	I don't know what the red is.
15478700	15479900	But I didn't like it.
15482060	15484380	Have I had to secret Abeliae in all these mix
15484380	15485340	that haven't used before?
15490460	15491740	It's down on its arse.
15494140	15494620	Yeah.
15495820	15496380	Hold on.
15498540	15499660	OK, what the fuck?
15500860	15501340	Oh, OK.
15501340	15501820	Of course.
15501820	15503260	OK, let's see what we're dealing with.
15505180	15505740	Why would we...
15508140	15509180	All right, let's destroy that.
15510700	15511500	Holy shit.
15512220	15514220	I forget I have nothing to level with.
15514220	15514940	I'm not getting hit.
15516300	15518460	Now, I don't have as much health as the Atlas.
15521500	15524060	It's not letting me select that one.
15526860	15529020	Red is how long it takes to wield it.
15529020	15532700	I don't know if you know it or working with people.
15536140	15536940	Quick.
15537500	15539020	I'm fucking trying, hen.
15541500	15543420	Oh, my God, he's already on fire.
15543420	15544300	It's fantastic.
15546780	15547260	Wow.
15549500	15550300	Wow.
15551660	15552300	Oh, it's...
15552300	15553100	I'm going to sneeze.
15553100	15553900	It's so lovely.
15554780	15555980	It brings a tear to me.
15555980	15558140	Oh, how fucking easy it is with a regular ult.
15560140	15564300	OK, let's get right into this.
15565180	15566460	Wow, you can't do that to me.
15566460	15567260	That wasn't very nice.
15568300	15569420	Oh, this is a fuck up.
15574220	15575180	OK, get fucked.
15575180	15576220	Great, you fuck off.
15577340	15577980	Holy shit.
15581580	15583420	Yeah, I definitely do not have as much health.
15583420	15584060	Can you...
15584060	15587100	As if there's a wee bam up there shooting me as well.
15587100	15587500	Hold on.
15589580	15590060	Hold on.
15591020	15591980	Yeah, yeah.
15591980	15592940	Take that, bitch.
15594540	15595020	Hold on.
15595500	15595980	Inbop.
15599660	15601100	Sorry, I'm trying so hard.
15601100	15603500	I would actually love to do this in one.
15603500	15605820	Because the only time I totally lost
15605820	15608140	was that crazy runaway mission,
15608140	15609660	which you had to have known the layout
15609660	15610700	to even know what to do.
15612060	15614620	And I jumped off the map like a dafty.
15616220	15617100	OK, that's fine.
15618940	15619420	Ooh.
15620860	15624220	Oh, this is what I remember my dad doing all the time.
15624220	15625180	I think it was me.
15627020	15627500	Hold on.
15628220	15629020	I'll just fuck him up.
15629900	15631420	Look at the thing in the background.
15631420	15636380	I'd really rather not have infinitely spawning enemies.
15636380	15637420	I don't know about you guys,
15637420	15641420	but infinite spawning enemies is not my sound of fun.
15642060	15643100	My sound of fun?
15643100	15645980	Gee, I can hardly speak and play at the same time.
15645980	15646540	I'm so sorry.
15647900	15650940	I think my dad used to perfectly not destroy the buildings
15650940	15653260	so he could collect all these items and leave them there.
15653260	15654060	I'm actually sorry.
15654060	15655900	I'm legit calling him after my aim is done.
15656940	15657820	Because I need to know.
15658620	15659420	I think it's true.
15660460	15661580	Oh, come on.
15661580	15662300	I got you.
15662300	15663100	Bear in square.
15663740	15664220	Oh, shit.
15664220	15664860	I'm low health.
15667820	15668460	Hold on.
15668460	15668940	Hold on.
15670140	15670540	Hold on.
15670540	15671820	I'm getting my dad on the phone right now.
15671820	15673580	He fucking walks me through this damn game.
15673580	15673980	Hold on.
15673980	15674620	There must be like...
15675900	15677020	Oh, come on.
15677020	15677900	Not another one.
15678860	15679980	OK, I'll just talk about that.
15679980	15682700	Where are these freaking supply bases?
15683020	15683500	Hold on.
15684220	15684940	Yeah, yeah.
15684940	15685660	No, no, no.
15685660	15687180	Why did the fillet go up?
15687180	15688300	I don't know why it is up.
15688300	15689580	I don't know why it is up.
15689580	15691260	Right, I just tried that one last week.
15692860	15693340	Are you?
15694700	15695420	No, he's not.
15695420	15696540	It's not reloaded yet.
15698860	15699740	Can I get you first?
15701100	15703180	Whoa, I need to start doing that whole crap.
15703180	15703820	Please.
15704620	15705340	Aim.
15705340	15705820	Please.
15705820	15706700	I'm begging you.
15706700	15707020	Aim.
15707980	15709500	Why aren't you freaking going off?
15709580	15710220	Yeah.
15711900	15712860	Oh, come on.
15712860	15713260	Freak.
15715100	15716380	Oh, come on.
15717740	15718780	Please, I'm on my knees.
15722380	15723580	I was far too early on that.
15723580	15724060	That's fine.
15724060	15724860	I can pick up the goods.
15727500	15727900	Wah.
15731100	15731740	OK, here we go.
15732380	15733180	Here we go.
15733180	15733740	Where is he?
15734300	15735340	Oh, fuck, I missed him.
15735340	15736380	I don't know where the fuck he was.
15737340	15738460	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
15738460	15739260	Oh, he's limping.
15739260	15740140	That's what we want to see.
15745660	15746700	Oh, thank goodness.
15749020	15749500	Crap.
15750940	15752620	I'm starting to feel the struggle.
15752620	15754620	I'm not sure how much confidence I've got.
15754620	15755660	I'm going to be honest.
15755660	15756540	I'm getting a bit nervous.
15756540	15757580	I'm getting a little shaky.
15757580	15758300	I'm getting nervous.
15759340	15761340	I'm going to grab this little guy over here.
15761340	15762060	Hail's bar.
15762060	15762780	I know.
15762780	15763260	I know.
15764620	15766140	Right, I can't grab that.
15766140	15766860	I got this.
15769820	15770940	Are these even possible?
15772700	15774700	I just destroyed my health bar for that.
15774700	15775260	Crap.
15775260	15776460	OK, OK, it's fine.
15776460	15776940	It's fine.
15777980	15779900	OK, I need to use my ultimate.
15779900	15780460	Holy crap.
15780460	15782300	It like respawns so quickly as well.
15783900	15784940	I'm still going to get to see you there.
15784940	15785340	Hold on.
15789420	15790940	OK, use my ultimate.
15790940	15791420	Wham.
15792860	15793420	Wham.
15794140	15795580	It's ultraviolet.
15796620	15796940	Whoa.
15797900	15799900	Please do not glitch out on the last mission.
15799900	15800700	I appreciate that.
15800700	15801260	I appreciate that.
15801260	15802220	I appreciate that.
15802220	15802460	Hold on.
15802460	15803420	I'm going to dream far.
15803420	15804940	Sir, Atlas inbound.
15804940	15806140	OK, OK, I can handle it.
15806140	15806860	Atlas is gone.
15806860	15808540	Let me just get the other things that are kind of
15808540	15809580	to plant me up with this.
15812140	15812860	Oh, here he comes.
15813740	15815100	Right, ultimate, ultimate.
15817100	15817580	OK.
15819020	15821020	Uh, how often?
15821020	15821420	OK.
15822540	15824140	Am I just kind of the mercenary?
15824140	15825420	I have a prolonged escape
15826380	15827180	to real life.
15827180	15827660	I am.
15827660	15829180	I'm happy to be the mercenary.
15829180	15830380	Hmm.
15830380	15831180	I don't like that.
15832460	15833580	OK, ultimate's ready.
15834780	15835580	Please.
15835580	15836700	OK, yay.
15836700	15837820	We hit nothing.
15837820	15838620	Let's go.
15838620	15839500	I love hitting nothing.
15840620	15841500	OK, he's on fire.
15841500	15842700	He's on fire.
15842700	15844700	I'm also in trouble equally, though.
15848460	15850780	Please drop pieces of health I beg of you.
15850780	15852780	Whoa, those rocks are also falling.
15853740	15857100	Let's destroy a few buildings while we're at it.
15861420	15863500	Yeah, I'm going to need the ability to see if there's going
15863500	15865260	to be more enemies about to spawn in.
15865260	15866940	I'm going to need the ability to see if this thing's
15866940	15869660	going to be great instead of, like, playing hide and go seek.
15871740	15874540	Zero aim assist on the health fire.
15874780	15875260	Yeah.
15882220	15885660	It's the field of view in this game is absolute.
15885660	15887260	Hey, it's all shadows.
15887260	15888940	I'm going to be fighting shadows right now.
15889580	15890380	Give me that.
15890380	15891180	Give me that.
15891180	15892220	As if I missed 20.
15892220	15892620	Hold on.
15896300	15896940	All right.
15896940	15899020	Let's hope there's some health on the route
15899020	15900540	because I'm sparking a little bit.
15900540	15902060	My little ankles are sparking.
15902060	15903740	It's just not a good sign at all.
15903820	15906540	You need to traverse these lava fields to get to the drill.
15906540	15907580	Yes, that's fine.
15909340	15910060	Who's that?
15910060	15911420	Oh, it's a mech.
15914460	15917180	OK, well, that was completely overheated for that,
15917180	15918060	not to get a look in.
15920140	15921420	Oh, god, there's two of them.
15922380	15922860	Sorry.
15922860	15924700	All you're going to hear in this is, um,
15925340	15928620	because I'm literally just spamming the button to activate it.
15928620	15929260	I'm so sorry.
15929260	15934380	I mean, it's working.
15935260	15936380	Oh, is he in the lava?
15940380	15941180	If you're right in front of me,
15941180	15942540	you're getting ultimated right now.
15943980	15947340	Oh, hey, that didn't quite work in the end, so that's OK.
15949260	15949980	Come on.
15949980	15952220	I'm so heavy.
15953020	15954460	I'm so hot.
15955260	15957260	The mech is like running on fire.
15959260	15960300	Bro, you aren't going to give up.
15964460	15966460	We'll get two health back from those two,
15966460	15968540	which should take me back to full health.
15968540	15969820	Oh, just under full health.
15972300	15973420	He's not going to lie.
15973420	15975980	I think that's how you're supposed to play this mech.
15975980	15976700	Just constantly.
15979100	15981020	Oh, wait, the lava plume.
15981020	15982940	I'm supposed to walk through the lava plume.
15984220	15987020	Is it possible to do it as little damage as possible?
15990140	15992540	OK, hold on.
15992540	15992940	Oh, no.
15996060	15997100	Oh, shit.
15997100	15997660	Oh, shit.
15997660	15998140	Oh, shit.
15998140	15998620	What have I done?
16004140	16005180	OK, OK, OK, it's fine.
16005180	16008380	It takes a hot second for it to actually register you're in lava,
16008380	16010780	which I'm quite glad about.
16012620	16014380	Wah, OK, that was a bit silly of me,
16014380	16014940	but we did it.
16014940	16015420	We did it.
16015420	16016300	We're fine.
16016300	16016780	Kind of.
16017740	16019020	We're fine.
16020860	16021660	OK, big one.
16022540	16024140	It might take a little bit of damage.
16025340	16026860	We better, we better, we better, we better.
16026860	16027420	Could have been worse.
16027420	16028060	Could have been worse.
16030860	16031340	OK.
16032540	16032860	OK.
16033980	16035580	OK, ultimate time, I guess.
16036700	16037900	Oh, completely missed.
16037900	16038540	No, I hit.
16039340	16041660	Wah, I hit, I hit, I hit.
16044220	16046620	Now, if this mech could just calm down a bit.
16047260	16050060	Whenever I hear something aiming at me.
16052060	16054060	The gate ahead will take you to the drill approach.
16054060	16054780	Hurry.
16054780	16055420	I see him.
16056380	16056860	I see him.
16057500	16059420	Oh, there's fucking Atlas as well.
16060140	16060940	Oh, shit.
16061740	16062620	Shit, shit, shit.
16062620	16063340	Do not like this.
16064140	16064860	Hold on.
16064860	16066380	I need to pick them off.
16066380	16067660	Oh, my God, I need to pick them off.
16068300	16070540	OK, Atlas has really low mobility,
16070540	16072300	which I'm going to use my damage.
16073420	16074940	One is taken down.
16075020	16077420	Maybe the Atlas can take some fucking damage.
16078940	16080220	OK, he's limping.
16080220	16081100	That's what I want to see.
16082940	16083740	That's what I want to see.
16083740	16085180	I want to see you limping, darling.
16085180	16087260	No, you want to limp for me, don't you?
16088140	16088860	Oh, yeah.
16089900	16090540	OK.
16090540	16091420	And then, ultimate.
16092380	16093260	And then, receive.
16094140	16096460	I'm going to spam you down until you're nothing.
16097660	16098620	OK, perfect.
16100060	16100620	Perfect.
16100620	16102780	I don't know if I can grab that.
16102780	16105260	I may be able to grab that with my invincibility shield.
16105260	16105980	Holy crap.
16106780	16108060	I think we're doing it.
16108060	16109420	I don't know what mission we're on.
16109420	16110940	I don't know if we're at the end of the game or not,
16110940	16111980	but I think we're doing it.
16113020	16113980	OK, perfect.
16113980	16116700	Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect.
16116700	16117500	Perfect.
16118540	16120460	Stony, leave me limping for real.
16120460	16123020	These fights are getting kind of heated.
16128300	16130300	Look, the map's covered in lava.
16130300	16131740	I'm overheating as a mech.
16131740	16134700	It's not a bad joke if you put two and two together.
16134700	16135180	Jeez.
16136780	16138540	These guys are terrible.
16138540	16139420	Whoa.
16139420	16140140	Next section.
16141980	16143580	Ready to rock number two.
16147420	16147660	Oh.
16149260	16151820	Sir, the trail isn't far down this path.
16151820	16154380	I am leading a number of large mechs defending it.
16154380	16155900	I wonder if they even know what they're guarding.
16156540	16158060	Captain, good luck.
16158060	16159100	We're depending on you.
16160060	16162700	Yeah, you keep saying the whole world is depending on my shoulders.
16162700	16163420	That's quite a lot.
16163420	16164220	I'm not going to lie.
16164220	16165980	Like, you know, not a lot gets to me,
16165980	16167820	but saying that the whole world depends on me,
16167820	16169500	like right now, right at this very second.
16169500	16170220	Yeah.
16170220	16172620	Sorry, I was just checking if there's like any secret behind me.
16173580	16175020	Stony, you always huggy here.
16178780	16181500	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
16181500	16181740	Right.
16181740	16182380	OK, wait.
16182380	16183980	If they've given me eight minutes,
16183980	16185820	this round can be done in four.
16185820	16186540	I am OK.
16187500	16188300	Holy shit.
16188300	16189500	I'm getting obliterated.
16189500	16190300	I'm not the good thing.
16191260	16192540	Like, actually obliterated.
16193420	16194860	I've not even started.
16196940	16197500	Oh, my God.
16197500	16199580	And I'm so slow to turn around.
16200460	16201500	Oh, I got him though.
16202460	16203340	OK, I got him though.
16203340	16203980	I got him though.
16205260	16205740	Oh, my God.
16205740	16205980	Right.
16205980	16207820	It only takes four minutes to finish this mission.
16207820	16208860	That's how it works.
16208860	16209580	That's how it works.
16209580	16210380	It's four minutes.
16210380	16211020	That's all.
16211020	16212060	And I'm already over here.
16212060	16212620	That's safe.
16215180	16215980	Oh.
16215980	16217020	What am I supposed to do?
16219980	16220940	I don't know.
16220940	16222220	For a man.
16223820	16224380	Four minutes.
16224380	16225820	And I can't even get around the corner.
16226940	16227580	Four minutes.
16227580	16229180	I'm already lost the frickin' minute.
16230220	16230620	Please.
16231740	16233260	Video game work with me here.
16233260	16233900	Yeah, that's right.
16233900	16234380	You better be.
16235420	16236620	Yeah, you better give me real quick.
16237180	16238940	I don't know if I'm fucking good.
16238940	16240380	I'm sorry for grabbing this stuff.
16240380	16241740	But if they gave me eight minutes,
16241740	16244860	that means I have four minutes to fuck all the show.
16246380	16247180	Are we already here?
16249580	16251340	Or did I have eight minutes to come here?
16251340	16252140	Whoa.
16252140	16253340	You perished.
16253340	16254860	Am I supposed to perish you?
16254860	16255580	I feel like it.
16259820	16261900	Uh, what?
16262860	16264540	I just wasted everything on that ship.
16264540	16265900	And that wasn't even my target.
16268060	16269180	Please, Atlas.
16269180	16270060	Not now.
16270060	16270620	Please.
16271660	16272220	Surely.
16272220	16273580	Oh, I've actually fucked that
16273580	16274620	because I went for that ship.
16274620	16276700	And it wasn't even my target.
16276700	16278460	It wasn't my target.
16278460	16280380	I've actually pulled that up so badly.
16280380	16280700	Okay.
16280700	16282540	We'll need to restart because I messed that up.
16282540	16283180	But that's okay.
16283180	16283660	Oh.
16285580	16286140	Hello.
16293820	16295500	Oh, because I aimed at that ship.
16295500	16296780	I got annihilated.
16297820	16298300	Holy.
16299900	16300300	Hmm.
16301580	16302460	Holy moly.
16303420	16304060	Okay.
16304060	16304300	Okay.
16304300	16304620	Yes.
16304620	16305820	I understand.
16305820	16307180	The drill isn't far down this path.
16307180	16307420	Okay.
16307420	16307900	Right.
16307900	16309420	Let's go to the choppers first.
16309420	16310540	We know there's choppers ahead.
16312540	16312620	Okay.
16312620	16313260	Here they come.
16317500	16320140	I don't really understand what I'm supposed to do.
16320140	16321020	I'm going to be honest.
16322540	16323420	It's tough to rule.
16327420	16327900	Hold on.
16333100	16334700	Holy moly.
16336700	16338860	I'm wondering because of the environment as well.
16338860	16339340	Oops.
16339340	16339820	Sorry.
16339820	16341740	Oh, and I just damaged myself.
16341740	16342380	Lucky me.
16345180	16349100	Um, because obviously I'm just so good at that.
16349100	16352700	Uh, it's actually my best winning strategy in this game.
16353980	16355900	Let's see if my snipe is better than this one.
16358540	16359980	Tanks are going to come around the corner.
16359980	16360700	Okay.
16360700	16361740	We already know that.
16362060	16363100	Oh, one's down already.
16363740	16363980	Okay.
16363980	16365980	We're doing a much better run already.
16368620	16370700	I need to keep using my ultimates.
16371980	16372860	Give me full health.
16375020	16376380	Do not shoot at the ship.
16376380	16378540	The ship is not the objective.
16379500	16381580	Shabby and harem.
16382940	16383980	What the heck?
16383980	16385500	I was about to redirect it to you.
16386780	16387740	Don't be selfish, Shabby.
16387740	16388460	Get back online.
16390140	16390540	Right.
16390620	16391260	Okay.
16391260	16391980	Take a breather.
16393020	16393500	Let's go.
16394620	16395100	Let's go.
16396460	16396940	Let's go.
16399180	16399980	Okay.
16399980	16401100	Atlas is on fire.
16401100	16401660	I repeat.
16401660	16402780	Atlas is on fire.
16402780	16403740	That's what we want to see.
16403740	16404620	Atlas down first.
16404620	16406300	Atlas is the biggest issue.
16406300	16406940	Hi, harem.
16406940	16408140	We're playing mech assault.
16408140	16409900	It's not the easiest game.
16409900	16411020	It's a very old game.
16411900	16413180	Very much an older game.
16413180	16415420	I am doing absolutely dog ass right now.
16415420	16415980	Holy crap.
16415980	16417580	I'm messing this up so badly.
16417580	16417980	Right.
16417980	16418460	Got one.
16419660	16420300	We've got one.
16420700	16421660	We've got one.
16421660	16422460	We've got one.
16422460	16423340	That's all we need.
16423980	16425660	My Ragnarok flame is a fact.
16425660	16426220	That's fine.
16426860	16430300	The second Atlas is now fucking up my ass.
16431340	16432300	I'm not the good way.
16433900	16436060	I am using my ultimate so much.
16436060	16436780	I really am.
16436780	16437660	I'm trying my best.
16437660	16438540	I am darling.
16438540	16439500	So I'm trying my best.
16439500	16439980	Hi, harem.
16439980	16441100	Hi, Shabby.
16441100	16441980	What was the...
16441980	16442540	What was the...
16442540	16445500	On the agendination for the stream today for sheepsters?
16445500	16446860	Actually, there's underwear.
16447660	16448700	What one it could be.
16449580	16451180	Oh, forgive me for sake.
16451180	16452780	I'm going to get a couple ammo.
16452780	16454140	I'm going to need to pick this up.
16454140	16455980	This fucking Atlas with his real gun
16455980	16457660	is going for my cooter.
16458300	16459340	And not the good way.
16460780	16461020	Okay.
16461020	16461980	Let's get rid of him.
16461980	16462380	Whoa.
16462380	16463340	That's not Atlas.
16463340	16464460	It's a different floor.
16465660	16466140	Right.
16466140	16466620	Get you.
16468380	16469500	Can you take some damage?
16469500	16471180	That would be great if you could have taken some...
16471180	16473340	Like, honestly, don't be so selfish.
16473340	16474860	Take some freaking damage.
16474860	16475260	Hold on.
16475900	16476620	Oh, please hit.
16476620	16477180	Please hit.
16477180	16477420	Okay.
16477420	16478060	We've got two hits.
16478060	16479340	We've got two hits from our ultimate.
16479340	16480300	I'll take it.
16480300	16481100	He's on fire.
16481100	16481740	He's on fire.
16481740	16482940	That's all I need to see.
16482940	16483660	That's all I need to see.
16484540	16484940	No.
16484940	16485900	Sorry, mate.
16485900	16486700	I'm getting more and more.
16486700	16487100	Fuck you.
16488300	16488700	Get right.
16489340	16489740	Get right.
16490380	16490860	Get right.
16492380	16492940	He's limping.
16492940	16493580	He's limping.
16494140	16494380	Oh, yeah.
16494380	16496060	I'm going to pick up the stuff that dropped over here.
16500140	16500380	Okay.
16501340	16501820	Oh, shit.
16501820	16502140	Hold on.
16502140	16503740	There's like a few things on the map.
16503740	16504060	Hold on.
16504060	16504380	Hold on.
16504380	16504780	Hold on.
16504780	16505740	There's a few things on the map.
16505740	16506140	Hold on.
16508540	16509020	Hold on.
16509020	16509660	Give me a second.
16510860	16512540	You guys need to relax.
16512540	16513100	Relax.
16513100	16513580	Relax.
16514940	16515180	Wait.
16516060	16517180	Relax.
16517180	16517660	Oh, my God.
16517660	16518620	What's the problem?
16518620	16520060	I'm just trying to destroy everything.
16520060	16521580	What's the problem?
16521580	16522380	Sheesh.
16522380	16523420	You guys don't have any fun.
16525420	16527340	Are they infinitely respawned?
16527340	16529180	Or am I misappropriated?
16531420	16532060	Holy crap.
16532060	16533580	Are these guys infinite respawned?
16536300	16537500	She's falling for the bait.
16538780	16539660	Here's the drill.
16539660	16541900	The grunt spam is probably to waste time.
16542460	16543740	Fuck you, old bitch.
16543740	16544780	Fuck you, bitch.
16544780	16545500	Fuck you, booty.
16545500	16546140	Fuck you, bitch.
16555020	16557020	Am I supposed to sacrifice myself?
16557020	16558860	I actually don't remember how this game ends.
16563500	16564620	Uh, I'll listen.
16565580	16566220	Self-destruct.
16566220	16569020	You must confirm triggering the self-destruct sequence
16569020	16570220	in order to blow up the drill.
16570220	16571820	Press the A button to self-destruct.
16578780	16580140	Am I going to get a cutscene?
16580700	16581980	That was so chaotic.
16584060	16585660	Okay, I sacrifice myself.
16585660	16585980	Okay.
16590220	16592060	Wait, we save all of humanity in the door.
16592060	16592780	You can get this.
16592780	16593820	Wait, did that survive?
16597180	16599100	The drilling device is going critical.
16599100	16599980	Keep in it.
16601420	16602700	Any chance our boy made it?
16604140	16604620	Unknown.
16606780	16608380	There's a secret escape pod?
16609660	16611820	Hey, Tiger, you're finally awake.
16611820	16612460	Oh, right.
16612460	16613980	So Lieutenant Foster and the Tex
16613980	16615420	have been looking at your little toy.
16616220	16618140	We thought you were taking the dirt nap for sure.
16618700	16619500	Nice trick.
16619500	16619980	Sirs?
16619980	16621820	Your cockpit carried you out of that inferno
16621820	16623660	and straight back to our loving arms.
16624220	16624620	Sirs?
16625340	16626860	You really need to see this.
16626860	16627260	Oh, no.
16627820	16629900	This is technology that we have never seen.
16630460	16631660	And this is just the start.
16632300	16634460	We're not sure yet what all it can do,
16634460	16635420	but it saved your life.
16636300	16637100	I wonder if the enemy...
16641660	16643100	We handed it to the word,
16643100	16644220	saved everyone's butt,
16644220	16646380	and in the process definitely got the prize.
16647100	16648460	The other Dragoons are still down there
16648460	16650540	mopping up the remaining fanatics.
16650540	16651980	Most of them started running after you,
16651980	16653180	86, their commander.
16654140	16655420	We beat them on this planet,
16655420	16657260	but I have a feeling this war is just beginning.
16657980	16659660	The problem is a lot of them got away
16659660	16661100	and they'll spread like a virus.
16661980	16663340	So congratulations.
16663340	16664540	We've earned our pay
16664540	16665500	and a permanent place
16665500	16666620	on the word of Blake to the list.
16666620	16667580	Yay, the framerate's fucking dying.
16667580	16668860	They'll be coming for us.
16668860	16670940	And I'm damned if I'm going to give them your toy back.
16671500	16673900	Question is, are you ready for this sport?
16674460	16675820	Sure.
16675820	16676620	I'm ready.
16680620	16681580	We did it.
16682380	16684780	And the video game journalist lied.
16684780	16685420	This game...
16685420	16686140	Oh, sorry.
16686700	16687180	Hold on.
16687180	16689180	My Xbox's dust issue.
16689180	16689660	Hold on.
16690700	16691660	Oh, my God.
16692300	16693500	What the heck just happened?
16695740	16696860	Jeez, Louise.
16697740	16698300	Oh, yeah.
16698300	16698620	Sorry.
16698620	16701660	The dust is really building up.
16701660	16702300	Holy crap.
16702300	16703180	We actually did it.
16703180	16703820	I'm so surprised.
16703820	16705660	I better just play that game.
16705660	16706140	Hi.
16707420	16708860	Hi, I'm Strawny.
16708860	16710620	I don't even have a chat in slide.
16710620	16711100	Hold on.
16712460	16712700	Nope.
16712700	16713420	That's just...
16713420	16714460	That's just my...
16716620	16718700	Where the heck am I supposed to be on this?
16719980	16720860	This?
16720860	16722140	Oh, I'm hiding.
16722140	16722940	Oh, okay.
16722940	16723980	Hi.
16723980	16725980	Oh, let me turn off reactive model.
16725980	16726700	We did it.
16727740	16728540	I said, let me...
16728540	16729660	Is that reactive model?
16729660	16731180	Is that how bright I normally am?
16731180	16732300	Jeez, that's so bright.
16733260	16734780	Hi.
16734780	16735900	Hi, Hirom.
16736940	16738780	Thank you for joining.
16738780	16739820	And thank you, Sheepsters,
16739900	16741900	for redirecting into me.
16741900	16743180	Wait, are you straining?
16743180	16744220	The cold fish?
16744220	16744860	Heck, yeah.
16747980	16750220	I don't know if you can hear my little background music
16750220	16751180	should be in right now.
16751740	16753420	But we freaking did it.
16753420	16755020	I didn't realize Sheepy was gonna finish,
16755020	16755420	to be honest.
16755420	16756940	I was gonna redirect into her,
16756940	16758700	but I don't know if anyone else was coming on.
16763260	16764300	Where is it?
16767340	16769580	Is there anyone alive at all?
16770300	16771580	Will you play the second game?
16771580	16773580	I didn't even know there was a second game.
16773580	16774780	Oh, Mamosa.
16774780	16775420	Yes, okay.
16775420	16777180	I can happily redirect into Mosa.
16778060	16778380	Right.
16779260	16780060	Just so you know,
16781180	16784140	I'm going to do my membership ASMR stream early,
16784140	16786940	because I genuinely thought it was gonna take
16786940	16789180	like a couple billion hours to do this.
16789820	16792540	And every single Veloer model has so much detail.
16792540	16794460	I don't even think the girls know this.
16794460	16796620	Oh, well, I spent a pretty penny.
16796620	16797500	Yeah, but we're like,
16797660	16799340	your models look like shit.
16799340	16800780	And it's like, try again.
16800780	16801660	Good luck with that, mate.
16801660	16802140	Good luck.
16803340	16804700	Like, I'm sorry,
16804700	16806460	but we got designed out the wazoo.
16807500	16808780	And starting remember,
16808780	16809980	you have a bedroom scene.
16809980	16810700	I forget.
16810700	16812620	Oh, somewhere.
16812620	16814700	Yeah, I'll set up for the ASMR.
16815660	16819340	Um, I didn't know Mekosal even had a second game.
16819340	16820860	I don't even think my dad played it.
16820860	16821900	Hold on a minute.
16822780	16823900	Your phone, I'm gonna be like,
16823900	16826300	dad, do you recommend the Mekosal 2 game?
16826300	16828060	And he'll be like, why, Strony?
16828060	16831340	And I'll be like, I may or may not have played it on stream,
16831340	16832380	the first one anyway.
16833420	16835580	Um, oh, I didn't know.
16836220	16838700	It has spectacular lighting.
16838700	16840380	Yeah, oh, your phone.
16843020	16844460	And the start in street.
16844460	16846700	Oh, you guys haven't even seen my singers.
16846700	16850220	I don't even have my singers that are like activated.
16851100	16852220	I don't even use it.
16852220	16854620	The dad, and dad will watch the whole vlog.
16854620	16857420	Honestly, he'll start giggling if I send him the link to that.
16858140	16860860	Um, but he's busy with work,
16860860	16862540	which is why I'm trying to get him retired,
16862540	16865260	because I don't want him to like work himself
16865260	16867180	until a heart attack or something like that.
16868140	16869260	Does dad play anything?
16869580	16873340	Um, I would say no.
16873340	16876460	However, when he comes over,
16876460	16878700	I'm gonna download Halo Wars for him,
16878700	16879980	and he can play Mekosal.
16879980	16882940	I'll keep this installed if he wants to play it.
16883580	16887900	Um, dad gaming channel when?
16887900	16890780	Are you more interested in my dad gaming than me?
16892620	16894300	Strontium Games.
16894300	16897900	Call the channel Strontium Plays Games or something like that.
16899100	16901020	Quick, donate to the dad retirement fund.
16901020	16901820	No, no, no, no.
16901820	16902700	Let me earn it.
16902700	16903580	Let me work for it.
16903580	16904940	Let me upload ASMR.
16904940	16907020	Let me do an exchange for goods and money.
16907020	16907900	Let me do that, okay?
16909020	16911260	Hey, you should do Halo Co-op.
16911260	16912140	I think we will.
16912940	16913820	I think we will.
16913820	16915820	I'm like, I don't know how much patience
16915820	16917660	and how long he'll play it for,
16917660	16922860	and the problem is if I ask him questions during the game,
16922860	16924540	he's probably gonna be like,
16925580	16928060	Shawnee, shut the fuck up and try to play the game.
16929500	16930460	He'll probably be like,
16930460	16932620	wait, you talk and play through the game the entire time.
16932620	16935260	I'm like, yeah, that's how it works when you stream.
16935260	16937660	You can either talk to chat
16937660	16939020	and like respond to what they're saying.
16939020	16940700	You can commentate the game.
16940700	16943260	You can go on a tangent and that kind of thing.
16943260	16945100	But he'll be like, look, I'm here trying
16945100	16947260	to like defeat the covenant, like shut up, Shawnee.
16947260	16948540	And I'll be like, okay, thanks, dad.
16948540	16949820	Okay, I'll try my best.
16950700	16953820	That's my only thing if I did try and do Co-op with my dad.
16955740	16957020	But maybe I could record it
16957020	16959980	and like put it into like a funny highlight video instead.
16959980	16963820	Because I was gonna do like my dad guesses VTuber names
16965100	16968380	or my dad renames VTubers for the heck of it.
16969100	16972700	Cause if you thought Fondle of Boozom was bad,
16972700	16977340	my dad's gonna start naming VTubers like after Celtic players
16977340	16979980	and be like, oh, that's Nakamura.
16979980	16984540	Oh, that's, is it John Elton was the manager?
16984540	16987980	Someone called John dad and dad, dad names Jen too.
16989420	16991580	Honestly, that'd be funny.
16992540	16993660	He plays the game.
16993660	16995020	I commentate over it.
16995020	16997500	Oh, possibly that would work out.
16998460	17001660	Um, would he call Azura tits McGee?
17001660	17002940	Oh, absolutely.
17002940	17005580	He, my dad is like absolutely hilarious.
17005580	17008620	Like one time we went into the Co-op together
17008620	17012060	and they sell these like frog cakes and he gasped
17012060	17015180	and he went, oh, Shawnee, it's Peppy.
17016060	17017260	Like Peppy the frog.
17018940	17021900	Is it true your dad is a fucking slime VTuber?
17021900	17026220	No, Shawnee on stream would have 30 second delays
17026220	17027580	so that Shawnee can censor it.
17027980	17031020	Oh, honestly, I'm like, my name is Shawnee.
17032380	17034700	Shawnee is not helping chat when he's being on stream.
17034700	17035260	My mom.
17038460	17041660	But yes, John Elton right now.
17043180	17046060	The manager that used to be for Celtic.
17046060	17047020	Oh, Jock Steen.
17047020	17048700	Sorry, not John Elton.
17048700	17052060	I don't, as Jock Steen was a previous manager at Celtic.
17053260	17055260	We need him to operate a Cyclist VTuber.
17055260	17058220	I think he'd rather stab himself in the Cyclops eye
17058220	17059980	than become a Cyclops VTuber.
17060860	17062460	Peppy the frog is my religion.
17063100	17067980	My favorite animal is Peppy the frog.
17069500	17073420	Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, yes, yes.
17073420	17074860	I bet your dad would like a slime.
17074860	17075580	You know what?
17076380	17077260	I'll ask him.
17077260	17079820	I'll, when, when he gets here,
17079820	17083020	I'll show him a picture of the gen two concepts
17083020	17085980	and I'll stick a slime girl in between one of them
17085980	17089100	and I'll get him to rate them one out of 10.
17089100	17092060	And I bet you he'll agree with me and I'll be like, that looks,
17092060	17095580	he'll be like, that looks like piss but colored blue.
17095580	17096700	That's what he's gonna say.
17098460	17100620	He's gonna forget Shawnee the second, the stream blue.
17100620	17102460	I know that's why we're not, we're not doing live.
17102460	17103340	No chance.
17103340	17105420	Shawnee and dad ain't, ain't coming live.
17107020	17109500	If he says yes to slime, there has to be one.
17109500	17110940	Okay, I'll make you a deal.
17111660	17116220	If the slime girl outranks any veal or concept that we have,
17116860	17119100	I will give someone a slime toggle.
17119100	17119740	How about that?
17122060	17125420	You can tell she be chatting here with the slime girl propaganda.
17125420	17127740	Honestly, your propaganda is useless.
17129660	17131500	Not all slime girls are blue.
17131500	17133580	What, you want, oh, so you don't even want
17133580	17135980	the traditional blue slime girl.
17135980	17139740	It has to be an alternative color of slime girl on top.
17139740	17142300	Wow, I see your priorities.
17142300	17143820	I see your priorities.
17143820	17144940	Shocking behavior.
17145660	17147660	Shocking, honestly.
17149740	17150700	Paint, purple.
17150700	17152220	You want a purple slime girl?
17153500	17153820	No.
17154860	17156620	Shawnee is immune to boob again though.
17157420	17158940	Shimmering orange.
17158940	17160300	Shimmering orange.
17161100	17163980	What, so she's fucking neon pea color.
17163980	17166780	Orange, tangerine slime girl.
17166780	17168860	I'll call her, I'll call her tango
17168860	17170140	because she's tangerine.
17170140	17170700	Why not?
17170700	17172220	White slime girl, all right, you're done.
17172220	17173500	You're done, mods, get that man.
17174140	17175820	Jump on, jump on mods.
17177260	17178620	Slime girl is the lowest tier.
17178620	17180140	It's like McDonald's of slime girls.
17180140	17182860	I have to admit, I agree with that sentiment.
17184140	17185740	I agree, I agree.
17185740	17189740	Nuclear yellow, white jar slime girl.
17189740	17191900	You're done, you're getting timed out as well, right?
17191900	17192780	You're all getting timed out.
17193580	17195580	If your pea is orange, you need to go to a doctor.
17195580	17196780	Are you squirming me right now?
17197340	17198620	I swear if you're asking for slime.
17198620	17199820	I'll take that BT.
17201020	17202220	Yeah, good luck.
17202220	17204860	Thank you for the tip, Rilke Cadmus.
17204860	17206940	You take that bit because I know for a fact
17206940	17208300	my dad couldn't give less of a,
17209580	17210540	about slime girls.
17211100	17214780	He, in a lineup of Gen 1's designs,
17215420	17218300	I already know he's gonna like she be the most
17218300	17219820	because they, because they're blonde.
17220860	17224060	I do know her, her chest is out.
17227020	17233900	It'll be she be he likes first, then Azura,
17233900	17237420	then Mercy, then Icey, then Amylast.
17238220	17239100	I can already tell.
17239820	17241500	I can already tell.
17243340	17245900	He's gonna be scared of the lollipops
17245900	17248060	because he doesn't consume anime.
17249100	17251740	If you don't consume anime or like any of that content,
17251740	17254140	it can be a bit startling seeing lollipops.
17256860	17258940	ASMR, Amy turns Strony into a slime girl.
17258940	17259660	I believe her.
17259660	17260460	Honestly.
17264140	17267580	Yeah, my, this man likes them big.
17267580	17269500	Yeah, he's definitely like,
17272380	17273900	he's not gonna be interested in,
17273900	17276620	I am not getting my dad to rate my beach ever model.
17276620	17279260	That seems a bit, other than like, I'll tell,
17279260	17281420	like he already knows that I'm Strony,
17281420	17283100	like after and such thing.
17283980	17288060	Understood, but we are in anime world.
17288060	17289740	Lollipop covered slime girl.
17289740	17290460	You know what?
17292220	17292940	You know what?
17292940	17294620	If I look back and chat one more time
17294620	17295660	and see the S word,
17298060	17300780	I'm going, I'm going, I'm going scorched earth.
17300780	17301660	I'm going nuclear.
17301660	17302700	Do I make myself clear?
17304940	17306540	So I'm not looking at chat right now.
17306540	17308380	I'm getting ready to redirect into mimosa
17308380	17311100	because she's about to reach the watch time.
17311100	17313260	So please do consider watching her.
17314060	17316380	I am going to take a five minute break
17316380	17317660	and then we are going to boot up.
17320700	17321500	I like them.
17324220	17325180	Scorched earth.
17326220	17330540	Scorched earth is a saying where,
17331500	17332380	you know what?
17332380	17333660	We're in the information age.
17333660	17336780	Scorched earth meaning, let's search it.
17337740	17341180	Scorched earth.
17341180	17343500	Used to describe a military policy
17343500	17346220	in which all houses, crops, factories
17346220	17347420	in the area are destroyed
17347420	17349740	so that the enemy cannot utilize them.
17351580	17353020	And in layman's terms,
17353020	17356300	scorched earth means that you're all in trouble
17356300	17357660	if I read slime one more time.
17359100	17362140	I don't know why you guys are like so interested in slime.
17362140	17363020	It's not.
17363020	17364380	Why are you, why?
17364380	17364780	Why?
17365580	17367420	It's not going to work in each of her.
17376140	17377260	Yeah, that's scorched.
17377260	17378140	What's scratched?
17378140	17379180	Oh, did I say it wrong?
17379180	17380620	Did I say scratched earth?
17382460	17383820	Scratch my arse earth.
17383820	17385260	I'll scratch the earth's arse.
17385260	17386700	Stronium will burn viola to the ground
17386700	17388220	before having a slime grow.
17388220	17390620	Now, if one of the girls wants a slime toggle,
17390620	17393180	sure, knock yourself out just to upset me.
17393180	17394380	I don't care if they want that.
17394780	17395820	They can get it.
17395820	17396380	They want it.
17396380	17396940	They could get it.
17396940	17399340	I'm not stopping them from any goals like that.
17399340	17402780	But if you are asking me for a straight up slime girl,
17402780	17409180	default outfit, default position, no, I don't care.
17409740	17410460	I don't care.
17411340	17414220	So any muscle mummy concepts, that's called leaks.
17414220	17415500	I'm not allowed to leak that yet.
17417420	17420460	All I can say is that there's been progress
17421660	17422540	behind the scenes.
17423260	17424060	That's all I can say.
17424060	17424940	I'm not saying nothing more.
17426300	17427580	Everything's under NDA.
17427580	17428780	No, there's no NDA.
17429900	17431900	Everything's under NDA though, but there's no NDA.
17432540	17433740	I can't be also NDA.
17433740	17434620	I fucking can't stand them.
17436780	17440140	An elemental girl, like a flaming raccoon and that.
17440140	17440860	You know what's funny?
17440860	17442860	I sent away a spring in Skyrim,
17442860	17445660	and I did not get back a spring in Skyrim at all.
17446460	17447340	But I sent it away.
17447340	17449100	So I tried my best.
17449740	17451340	You are the NDA.
17451340	17453420	I'm an NDA's worst nightmare.
17453420	17455980	I am literally loose lip sync ships.
17455980	17459580	I cannot shut the fuck up about all my interests.
17459580	17461660	We've got the first animation back
17461660	17465180	for the alternative video game, and it looks good.
17465180	17465900	It looks good.
17467020	17469180	I just don't know how long it's going to take.
17469180	17473900	I still want to say July, end of July.
17475740	17480620	If not very early August, incredibly early August,
17480700	17484060	there's no way it's going past halfway through August.
17485020	17486780	We're just waiting on the animations,
17486780	17487740	and then everything,
17487740	17489660	all the puzzle pieces can be put together
17489660	17491580	once the animations are finalized.
17491580	17494700	I saw a preview of Icy's animation,
17494700	17496060	and you're welcome.
17496940	17498620	I saw I'm going to say you're welcome.
17500620	17502700	We only bring up some stuff to tease.
17502700	17504380	Yeah, I know you teasing.
17504380	17505980	I wanted to make a joke about our lips,
17505980	17507500	but the Japanese one wins.
17507500	17508140	I know.
17508140	17509420	You need to be quick.
17509500	17511340	You need to be quick,
17511340	17513420	if you want to make a joke on something I said,
17513420	17515180	because I'll be off it real quick.
17516460	17517900	As the human race has proven,
17517900	17521820	anything can be at this point.
17522460	17523180	You want us quick?
17523180	17524940	Are you kidding me right now?
17524940	17526300	I swear if this is a slime girl.
17526300	17529180	Strongly, if you're up for a scary game,
17529180	17533340	a few days ago a game called Still Wakes the Deep came out.
17533340	17536940	It takes place on a Scottish oil rig and has a great story.
17536940	17537900	Oh, does it?
17537900	17538620	Is it?
17538620	17540780	Oh, I need to get a heart rate monitor.
17540780	17541580	I don't.
17541580	17541900	Hold on.
17541900	17543500	Let me put it in my notes right now.
17543500	17544540	Like right this moment.
17566380	17566780	Hold on.
17566780	17567820	Let me write my notes.
17567820	17568380	Write my notes.
17568780	17570860	Heart rate monitor because I need it,
17570860	17572460	and then I need a new shot caller,
17572460	17573660	or actually hold on.
17574300	17577820	Sin sister, shot caller, cold smile.
17578620	17580700	Her problem now, not mine.
17581900	17583580	Yes, I might give it a shot.
17583580	17585740	Also, actually Scottish voice actors,
17585740	17587260	not Americans try to be Scottish.
17587260	17588860	Oh, praise the fucking Lord.
17588860	17591660	It's not that hard to find Scottish actors.
17591660	17595660	It's that thing like Junkrat and Overwatch as an American,
17595660	17596780	and it was like, oh, come on.
17596780	17599740	You're telling me there wasn't one voice actor available
17599740	17601900	that could do Maniac Australian?
17601900	17603340	Yeah, I find that hard to believe.
17604620	17605660	Mentioning the heart rate monitor,
17605660	17606540	did you get the burner phone?
17606540	17609100	No, I'm going to ask Sin sister
17609100	17611020	if I could just use her phone number.
17611020	17612060	Yeah, oh, well, yeah.
17612060	17614300	Okay, well, we both just answered each other's question there.
17617020	17620540	He's getting the feeling for having a shield generator.
17621980	17624300	Is the Australian guy from Siege voice finals?
17624300	17624860	I have no idea.
17624860	17626540	Name two Scottish voice actors.
17631340	17632860	Strony Cuttles and Sin sister.
17632860	17633180	Thank you.
17633180	17633420	Thank you.
17633420	17634140	I'll be here all day.
17634940	17635500	Anyone else?
17635500	17635980	Anyone else?
17638780	17642780	I promise you it's not that hard to find actual a Scottish.
17643420	17645180	Well, actually, Sin sister doesn't count
17645180	17645900	because she's not.
17647980	17649340	She's honorary Scott.
17649340	17650140	You know what I mean?
17650140	17651660	Okay, look, you know what I mean?
17652700	17653820	No, Sin isn't Scottish.
17655580	17656940	You thought I was Welsh?
17656940	17657740	What the fuck?
17659260	17660060	Are you trolling?
17660060	17661420	You did not think I was Welsh.
17662940	17663900	Isn't Welsh like,
17665500	17668220	I'm the only gay in the village that's Welsh?
17669340	17673580	No. Sin is honorary Scott,
17673580	17674860	which not actually is not.
17676460	17678460	No one can do a good fake Scott accent.
17679260	17683180	It's like there is no Welsh and Strony now.
17685740	17687100	Someone thought you were Welsh or anything.
17687100	17688780	Oh my God, Sheep Girl, Gen 2 confirmed.
17689580	17694060	And then POV, you're supposed to be a Sheep Shagger.
17694060	17694860	Oh, that's awful.
17694860	17695980	I'm sorry for even saying that.
17696860	17698060	It's funny in the moment,
17698060	17699340	but now that I've said it out loud.
17699340	17701340	Oh, thank you for the tip anonymous as well.
17701340	17703020	But yes, I'll definitely,
17703020	17704460	once the heart rate monitor comes through,
17704460	17705820	I will be messing around.
17705820	17710540	I want to do that fitness Nintendo game Ring Fit,
17710540	17712300	but again, I need a heart rate monitor
17712300	17714540	to show you how quickly my heart is about to explode
17714540	17716540	because I'm needing to get some exercise in
17716540	17718060	and because I'm streaming all along,
17718060	17719580	I'm not really getting that exercise.
17720780	17722300	I'm being a naughty girl.
17723340	17725260	I'm not getting that exercise.
17725260	17726540	I'm going to do it with you.
17728940	17730140	But yes, I'm going to be doing that.
17732780	17737180	No, I've got my first limited ad stream.
17737980	17740700	No, this cannot.
17740700	17741820	No, what?
17741900	17743660	I've got, no.
17743660	17745820	More things have been hit with limited ads.
17747100	17747980	No way.
17750860	17755020	My freaking, my RuneScape stream.
17756860	17760220	My RuneScape stream where I got Wrecked and Connect 4
17760220	17761740	got hit with limited ads.
17761740	17763020	Don't you dare, YouTube.
17764220	17765500	Stop it, YouTube.
17765500	17766780	You're so stinky.
17768460	17771180	Okay, but all my other stuff is fine.
17771420	17774780	Literally the RuneScape is probably because of the tinfoil.
17774780	17776540	We spoke too much about BlackRock.
17776540	17777180	They got me.
17777180	17777740	I can't believe it.
17777740	17778940	They're killing my income source.
17779820	17781340	Right, I just,
17781340	17783820	I'm going to redirect into mimosa in a second.
17783820	17787500	I do want to say tomorrow,
17789580	17792700	if I'm not mistaken, is Valtral, okay?
17793740	17794700	But hear me out.
17795580	17801020	It is two hours after my usual stream start time.
17801740	17802060	Okay?
17802780	17804140	It's going to be a shorter stream
17804140	17806940	so I can focus on some ASMR work as I always do.
17807660	17810380	In Valtral, oh, sorry.
17810380	17812300	Ballatral or Valtral.
17815100	17817740	It starts two hours later
17817740	17819900	because Veeler having a meet-in.
17819900	17822780	I need to make sure the girls are all good and even fine.
17822860	17824060	Catch them up with them
17824060	17825980	because I really had a chance to talk to them all.
17827260	17828540	Obviously, Emma doesn't count
17828540	17830380	because she's not even at her PC.
17830380	17831580	She's not even in the company.
17832940	17835260	But yeah, we're going to have a nice little girl group meeting
17835260	17838380	and the best time zone for it was my start time
17838380	17841500	because American, Europe, mashed together.
17841500	17842620	And what do you get? A pancake.
17845100	17846700	So I'm going to be two hours.
17847260	17848460	No, I'm not going to be late.
17848460	17849820	The stream is two hours later.
17849820	17851820	So just keep that in mind for Valtral.
17851820	17853660	The stream is two hours later than usual
17854300	17856540	just because I'm catching up with my girls,
17856540	17857900	making sure everything's okay
17857900	17859580	and everyone's having a good time.
17860940	17863740	Because it's all fine and well,
17863740	17865980	like sending a message or a DM and being like,
17865980	17866700	oh, are you good?
17866700	17868860	But when you hear someone in voice chat,
17868860	17870060	they can bring up concerns
17870060	17872940	or they can bring up things they maybe hoped
17872940	17874700	would be better or have gone better.
17874700	17879260	So yeah, too early.
17879260	17880860	I don't really think it's going to be that long
17880860	17881820	unless we girls can.
17883020	17884780	You know what happens when girls get together?
17884780	17885740	Can't shut the fuck up.
17886940	17888940	But yeah, two hours extra sleep.
17888940	17889500	Nice.
17889500	17891820	Yeah, it's literally for the folk
17891820	17894460	who are like absolutely exhausted.
17894460	17895740	You get two extra hours.
17897580	17900140	God, my French tip nails are growing.
17900140	17902140	The fuck is actually getting pretty gross now.
17902140	17904060	I'll have to admit, yeah.
17905420	17906620	Yapping intensifies.
17906620	17908780	Yeah, basically it's just going to be a big old yap fest
17908860	17910300	and I'll be like, I hope you guys are okay.
17910300	17911500	And everyone will be like, yeah, you're okay.
17912700	17915500	And I completely forgot to do that 5K celebration
17916220	17917500	because everyone hit 5K.
17917500	17921020	So I'm going to see if I can get the social media manager
17921020	17925420	to post the artwork I got for it as a celebration.
17925420	17928380	I cannot wait for you guys to see the 10K celebration
17928380	17929580	on everyone.
17929580	17931340	I got a really good artwork.
17931340	17932300	Sorry, but it's like that.
17934140	17935820	It's a beautiful 10K artwork.
17936700	17941100	You VLU girls are running your purr fans' ragged.
17941660	17943660	Are you drained like that one meme?
17944860	17945580	Don't mention it.
17945580	17946620	How's your heart doing?
17946620	17947580	A lot better.
17947580	17954940	It's still like blood underneath the skin.
17956940	17959100	That's what it is at the moment.
17961500	17963180	A video or a picture.
17963180	17964700	An artwork.
17964700	17967660	I got a special artwork for 10K,000 subscribers.
17967660	17971180	For like, when everyone reaches 10,000 subscribers,
17971980	17975180	it will go live and it's a beautiful piece of artwork.
17975980	17977260	I absolutely adore it.
17977260	17986140	I think we might try and work on free access rewards at Milestones.
17986140	17991740	So you know how I'm kind of doing one ASMR video per 1,000 subscribers?
17992460	17996140	I obviously am in a bit of a deficit and need to start uploading them.
17996140	17996540	But I will.
17996540	17997100	I'm getting on it.
17997100	17998140	I promise I'm getting on it.
17998140	18006380	I am going to see if the girls might consider doing,
18006380	18008940	even if it's like a voice pack, for example,
18010460	18014220	or like a thank you audio on the alternative account,
18014220	18016380	something like that when they reach Milestones,
18016380	18018380	just to make things like a bit sweeter,
18018460	18021900	like any support you are clipping or tweeting or retweeting,
18021900	18023980	or you know, any support like that.
18023980	18028060	It just, it feels a bit sweeter and that you are getting rewarded for it.
18030060	18031740	I think the problem is more YouTube you already made.
18031740	18033980	I definitely did make the 2K one,
18033980	18036700	but I'll go back to the drawing board.
18036700	18037660	It's not a problem.
18037660	18040300	I'm going to do a tapping one with my fake nails,
18040300	18043020	because fake nails sound awesome when it comes to tapping anymore.
18043980	18044540	And strong.
18044540	18046140	Your feet are still hot listening.
18046140	18046780	Oh, don't.
18046780	18048140	Oh, don't say it like that.
18048940	18049900	Don't say it like that.
18051740	18055580	And I'm basically that Mexican alien.
18057580	18063100	And but yes, I am going to let you guys get redirected into mimosa.
18063100	18068540	Please do consider hanging about for a couple of cheeky minutes or so,
18068540	18071500	because she is very close to being monetized.
18071500	18073660	She just needs to watch ours.
18073660	18076540	So she's pushing herself for an endurance stream,
18076540	18084780	which has made her a perfect target for my Borderlands 2 gameplay that I want to sort out.
18084780	18086940	I want to see if I maybe get it done in July.
18088620	18090620	Mimosa seems like a good candidate.
18090620	18094620	I'm wondering if I could grab an endurance stream from VNU,
18094620	18098300	and then an endurance streamer from Mythos.
18098300	18101580	And then it could be like a really cool four way like get to know each other.
18103580	18106540	There's been fucking VTubers are so nice to me, by the way.
18106540	18107100	Holy shit.
18107100	18109100	I've got another ASMR collab on the way.
18110380	18113580	Turns out VTubers like are so kind and give you the time of day.
18113580	18117900	Like I redirected into AcoNono.
18117900	18121420	Did you see her little fucking call saying it was so good?
18121420	18122060	I don't know.
18122060	18123100	Sorry, not AcoNono.
18123100	18123740	I don't know.
18123740	18124540	With the bouquets.
18124860	18129100	And she was like, I think Strongie is a cult fish and stuff.
18129100	18131020	And then she followed me on Twitter and I'm like,
18131020	18133260	Gee, Willy, Curse, you've got me blushing now.
18133260	18133740	Stop it.
18135500	18137180	But yeah, VTubers are so fucking nice.
18137180	18138300	Sorry, I don't care where anyone says.
18138300	18139420	I'll defend VTubers.
18140060	18140940	Yeah, alias.
18140940	18142380	Literally VTubers are so nice.
18142380	18142940	I said it.
18142940	18143580	I said it.
18143580	18144060	They're nice.
18144060	18145180	Everyone seems so nice to me.
18145180	18145740	What the fuck?
18145740	18147820	They're not like, oh sorry, that was my controller.
18147820	18148780	They're not like, oh you whore.
18148780	18149900	I don't want to interact with you.
18149900	18151260	They're like, oh my god, it's you.
18151260	18152860	Yeah, I'd love to do an ASMR collab.
18152860	18154460	And I'm like, oh, it's so freaking cute.
18154460	18155260	The yes chant.
18155260	18155980	Yeah, it's for him.
18157660	18159580	We love VTubers around these parts.
18159580	18160620	Let's go.
18160620	18161100	Yes.
18161100	18161980	Okay.
18161980	18165740	I am going to go offline and give me 15 minutes.
18165740	18167180	I'm going to get some food down my gullet
18167180	18168540	and I'm going to get a cup of tea
18168540	18172220	and then I'll come back for a membership ASMR stream again
18172220	18173980	where we can just babble away to each other.
18175420	18176780	If you an alias collab.
18176780	18179020	Oh, I've not even, I've not, it wasn't alias.
18179020	18182220	I was actually someone else who I've never interacted with before.
18182860	18186700	They agreed to that collab, but I don't know.
18186700	18188620	Maybe I should be a cheeky shite and ask alias.
18189580	18189900	I don't know.
18189900	18191340	I feel like it's getting really cheeky now
18191340	18194060	because I think that would be my 10th ass collab
18194060	18195500	and only one is up right now.
18195500	18196780	But it's because I need time to do it.
18196780	18198300	And I don't, as far as I'm aware,
18198300	18200380	I don't think any VTuber is like, oh my god,
18200380	18202540	you've still not done, you've still not sent me your script.
18202540	18204460	You've still not like edited it together.
18204460	18205740	I don't think anyone's being cheeky.
18205740	18208460	I'm like, I think they can see like how hard I'm trying elsewhere.
18209500	18210620	And I'll get there slowly.
18210620	18212220	Things will, things will go slowly.
18213420	18217900	Um, V4, well, I was actually gonna start getting on at them
18217900	18220540	because Dr. Nova was so nice to me as well.
18220540	18222460	She was such a cutie, Batuti.
18222460	18225020	She did like the spit thing with Shibi's mouth
18225020	18226860	and I was like, that's honestly so creative.
18226860	18228780	My brain could not even figure out how you did that.
18229660	18230780	A perfectionist.
18230780	18232300	Oh no, I'm not a perfectionist.
18232300	18235020	It's because I've run out of time and I'm mentally exhausted.
18235020	18237500	Like yesterday, I had a complete like,
18238540	18241260	um, my body finally broke down,
18241340	18243500	but in a good way that allowed me to sleep.
18243500	18246060	So basically I finished the Umi Plus collab
18246060	18247500	after my three streams that day,
18247500	18250380	just, just feeling like a little bit of an overachiever there.
18250940	18258940	Um, and then I did, um, I went straight to bed.
18258940	18260540	I went straight to sleep.
18260540	18263660	I slept for about five hours, woke up.
18263660	18267260	I was like, I need to birth this loaf of bread right effing now.
18267260	18271740	Did that, had a shower, ordered takeaway as I do normally.
18273500	18275740	And then I passed out again until Microsoft.
18275740	18278060	I woke up 10 minutes before Microsoft,
18278060	18280300	but I've finally had a rest.
18280300	18282540	Like, I don't feel that exhaustion
18282540	18285180	that was looming over me for so long.
18285180	18286620	Like, I don't feel it right now.
18286620	18287660	I'm so freaking glad.
18288380	18289260	How's the loaf?
18289260	18292140	The loaf, um, yes, it's gone.
18292860	18293660	The loaf is gone.
18294940	18296460	Well, the spit in the air, she's crazy.
18296540	18298220	There's a lot of very unique stuff apparently.
18298220	18300220	Oh, right.
18302060	18304540	No, no, finally taking care.
18304540	18307420	It's, things are so, it's because there's so much chaos
18307420	18308540	and start in the first month,
18308540	18310860	but now that the first month like is over,
18311740	18315180	um, we can actually do it.
18317340	18318540	We can actually do it.
18318540	18320460	We can actually like achieve all our,
18320460	18323100	uh, missions and objectives and all of that.
18323100	18326380	Like, oh, and like fucking hell,
18326380	18327740	it's been like, well, hold on.
18327740	18329500	I'm going to open up my YouTube stats right now.
18330620	18333260	It's been a month of streaming
18333260	18338060	and I have made 300,000 views on my content.
18339340	18341020	And the month hasn't even finished.
18341020	18343500	I mean, hell, maybe even be more to it, you know?
18345420	18348380	Literally, I am over a quarter of a million views
18348380	18350380	and I'm a new VTuber and it's been a month.
18350460	18352860	Like, y'all know, y'all know.
18353900	18356220	Uh, what does it say for subscribers?
18356220	18358780	8,600, like it's the first month.
18358780	18359660	This is insane.
18359660	18360700	This is insanity.
18361420	18364300	Um, so I definitely want to start pushing those ASMR videos
18364300	18366220	out consistently because I don't want to,
18366220	18369260	I don't want anyone thinking I'm taking like the PS
18369260	18370220	when I'm doing it, you know?
18371500	18374060	I thought she was about to say 300,000 dollars.
18374060	18376300	Well, if I make 300,000 dollars,
18376300	18377820	I'm happy to say that, yeah,
18377820	18379260	Gentoon through your end production
18379260	18380860	and no, I do not need to do a donathon.
18382860	18385020	But yeah, for my birthday donathon,
18385020	18386460	which is October 10th,
18386460	18392700	my goals are pretty much set up to be agency-orientated.
18393900	18394300	So yeah.
18395740	18397580	Strangely, if you don't care yourself,
18397580	18398540	you'll be mad.
18398540	18399020	P.S.
18399820	18401500	Considering it's you, I mean, that's surprising.
18402060	18403420	It's because you put out four times
18403420	18404460	the average amount of content,
18404460	18407260	you get tons of views from your consistent viewer base.
18407260	18408460	For again, I was getting worried,
18408460	18409580	you guys aren't going to like stuff,
18409580	18410540	but you always do.
18410540	18414620	And I'm like, is this what unconditional love feels like?
18414620	18415980	Oh, my heart.
18415980	18418460	Oh, it made me cry.
18419660	18422620	Um, I can't wait to see the birthday
18422620	18424700	just to play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood again.
18424700	18426940	Honestly, I'm so, I'm so ready.
18428060	18429580	Such a hard worker.
18429580	18432060	I work hard because you guys won't beat me, okay?
18433900	18435180	Did you see the Sheevee clip
18435180	18438300	where she talked about all your fan bases,
18438300	18439100	my wee wifling?
18440380	18442060	All your wiflings are belong to us.
18442780	18445020	You're a pretty likable person, thank yous,
18445020	18446780	because I used to wipe ass in care homes.
18447500	18449340	I mean, it humbles you very much
18449340	18451900	when you wipe old lady ass, I have to admit.
18451900	18455980	Or an old man gets a bone bone
18455980	18457660	because you're having to change his diaper,
18457660	18458380	so that's really fun.
18459340	18460140	It really humbles you.
18460140	18463020	It really gives you a very unique, strong personality, you know?
18465980	18468940	Um, you could do a stream of watching paint dry
18468940	18469980	and I'd probably watch it with you.
18469980	18471260	Hey, let's do it.
18471260	18472700	Shawnee, you need to learn that we love you.
18472700	18473740	We love everything you do.
18473740	18475420	Darling, that'll be nice to me.
18476140	18478460	If we miss one stream, we miss a week's worth of yeah
18478460	18479980	when it's compared to others.
18479980	18483020	Well, you guys were telling me that people that do,
18483020	18484460	that have membership,
18484460	18487100	some people like do one membership stream a month.
18487100	18491580	I'm like, this is an exchange of goods and services.
18491580	18494620	You have to make the exchange of goods and services worth it.
18495340	18495900	Don't you?
18496620	18498300	All right, don't people move away
18498300	18500620	if you don't make it worth their time, worth their whale?
18503660	18504540	I wouldn't get humbled.
18504540	18506780	I'm more like boosted, to be honest.
18507500	18509820	I, I don't know if it's because I grew up
18509820	18511900	looking after like cats and all of that.
18512620	18522460	Um, that basically any puke cat or shat,
18523100	18524380	it doesn't really faze me.
18525020	18527580	And like, yeah, the thing,
18527580	18529420	probably the thing that grosses me out
18529420	18531260	is like a decomposing corpse.
18531260	18533500	That's probably what would gross me out
18533500	18535980	in terms of like body fluids and stuff.
18535980	18538460	Like, I don't, this is kind of off topic,
18538460	18539500	but um, you know,
18539500	18542140	if you have a dementia patient in your care,
18542140	18546700	it's actually quite common to do brown smearing,
18547420	18549500	brown painting, if you will.
18549500	18550940	It's actually quite common.
18551740	18552940	Because when you have dementia,
18552940	18554780	you lose, you don't understand what you're doing.
18555660	18556780	And it's just a wee shame.
18556780	18559020	And like when, you know,
18559020	18561020	for example, when I entered the room,
18561020	18564060	you know, you go, you get shocked at first
18564060	18565180	and then you're like, wait,
18565180	18567980	if I don't clean up this, this person,
18567980	18569500	you know, they're going to be,
18569500	18571180	you know, sitting in this situation
18571180	18571980	and it's not nice.
18571980	18573340	So you do the right thing
18573340	18575500	and you know, you put your protective gear on
18575500	18577820	and you get to work and make sure they're all showered
18577820	18579580	and fresh sheets and all that.
18579580	18580700	And you just get to it.
18580700	18582060	That's, it's just how it is.
18582140	18583180	It's very straightforward.
18583180	18584220	I know it can be quite,
18586860	18588060	quite daunting, I guess,
18588060	18590220	maybe if the first time you're ever tasked with it,
18590220	18593340	but it makes you realize like, look, yeah,
18593340	18594380	okay, it's a bit gross.
18594380	18595580	Yeah, it doesn't smell nice.
18595580	18597900	No one's expected it to smell
18597900	18599500	like marshmallow fluff or whatever.
18599500	18601740	But yeah, you know, you just,
18601740	18602460	you just go for it.
18602460	18604460	You do the right, you do the best you can.
18608460	18611660	Yeah, dementia decline has actually tried it.
18611660	18613740	Yeah, it's, it's pretty fucking rough.
18613740	18614380	I have to admit.
18615340	18617740	Maui, Maui Gran had a fall
18617740	18619580	and a lot of sickness followed.
18619580	18621020	I don't know what it is.
18621020	18622460	Well, I don't know what it is.
18622460	18626620	Basically, old person has fall deteriorates rapidly.
18626620	18628940	More news at three is the most common way
18628940	18630620	that an old person pops or clogs.
18630620	18631100	I don't know.
18631100	18631980	Well, I don't know why
18631980	18633580	because it's like a shock to the system
18633580	18635020	and the body can't repair.
18635020	18637100	I think they say after the age of 30,
18637100	18639180	your body no longer is growing
18639180	18640220	and becoming a new.
18640220	18643180	It's just focusing on repair and maintenance
18643180	18644220	beyond like 30.
18646380	18648220	Did anyone paint anything cool?
18648220	18649420	One, that's funny too.
18649420	18650140	Shut the fuck up.
18653420	18655340	The fact that you could do it is commendable.
18655340	18656380	I've seen the bad parents.
18657260	18659580	Like honestly, if you ever like have to be the caretaker
18659580	18660700	of someone with dementia,
18660700	18662860	don't ever feel bad if you have to put them in a care home.
18662860	18664860	Like I know there's so many stories
18664860	18667420	that come out about care homes being bad at this and that.
18667420	18669980	I promise you at the forefront of care homes,
18669980	18672300	there are people who genuinely have the willpower
18672300	18674460	and the care, like they do genuinely care
18674460	18675660	and try their best.
18675660	18677980	The problem is the greedy corporations
18677980	18680700	that purposely understaff entire units.
18680700	18683340	I think my worst ever shift was like
18684380	18688540	to people to over 50 residents on one floor.
18689100	18692060	Like, no, it's not possible.
18693020	18694460	It's not possible.
18694460	18695420	So, yeah.
18696380	18700060	Yeah, as you age, you get worse at healing
18700060	18701340	and in the case of the elderly,
18701340	18703260	falling loss of balance is like just,
18703260	18704620	yeah, like fricking straight up.
18705420	18706620	Hey, strongy, you done with gaming?
18706620	18708700	I'm so sorry, MLG did it.
18708700	18714220	The Microsoft was supposedly supposed to be eight hours,
18714220	18716220	but that was a game developers assessment.
18716220	18717500	So they were wrong.
18717500	18718300	They were wrong.
18721420	18723660	I've seen nurses in care homes mistreat the elderly.
18723660	18725180	I would never have put my parents in one.
18725180	18726620	It's like such a hard balance
18726620	18728860	because to get at home health is not easy.
18728860	18729500	It's not cheap.
18729500	18732700	It's not even viable for a lot of people.
18732700	18736060	However, I think with the rise
18736060	18738700	of multi-generational households,
18739340	18743500	I think that is going to be a very lovely solution.
18745180	18749500	I would very much like to see in my lifetime
18749500	18752860	the rise of multi-generational households again
18752860	18755020	or very close-knit communities again.
18755580	18757100	Gardening, I'm going to see that picked up
18757100	18759340	so we start relying on the big supermarkets.
18760140	18762300	But anyway, before I put my tinfoil hat on,
18762300	18764380	how about we redirect into mimosa?
18764380	18765900	I'll get some food in my tum tum
18765900	18769100	and I will put up my membership ASMR stream
18769100	18770460	in 10 minutes time.
18770460	18771420	Give me 10 minutes.
18773260	18775660	Make a salt was, it was good.
18775660	18778700	I may have perished in the lava by accident.
18779500	18783660	And I also bumrushed the last mission, which didn't work.
18786300	18787180	Did you get your game?
18787180	18790300	No, the way I type in game and then how long?
18790300	18792220	So I literally type in mech assault, how long?
18792220	18794140	And I'm pretty sure if you type it in Google right now,
18794140	18795420	it says eight hours.
18795420	18797260	Oh my God, what happens if we type the same thing
18797260	18798620	on Google at the same time, right?
18798620	18801500	Mech assault, how long Google?
18803820	18807660	Main story, seven hours and 44 minutes.
18809660	18811340	Uh-huh, that's right.
18811340	18814620	And I did it in five, I think, roughly five.
18817420	18820220	There's a site called how long to be, exactly.
18820220	18821980	It's gonna be a membership tinfoil ASMR.
18821980	18823500	Honestly, it does may take me long.
18823500	18825180	It does may take me long to get started.
18826060	18828860	Okay, she's a gamer.
18828860	18830060	Oh my God, wait, what's this?
18830060	18831260	What's the speed run?
18832140	18836460	Mech assault, speed run, world, world record.
18837420	18840940	Let's see if my, can I be the first person to submit for it?
18844460	18847900	No, wait, I can be seventh place, shut up.
18849980	18853260	How can someone defeat the game in 59 minutes?
18854300	18857180	Whoever the fuck you are, elite two heroes,
18857180	18859260	I'm coming for your British ass.
18859260	18862380	Fucking 59 minutes, it took me five hours.
18862380	18863660	Right, I'm going for seventh place.
18863660	18865660	I'm gonna submit myself for mech assault, thanks.
18866860	18869820	And ironically making strongy cuttles right now on speedrun.com.
18872460	18874140	Speedrunners are insane.
18874140	18876860	Seventh place gamer, yay, I'm seventh place.
18876860	18878300	Let's go, seventh place.
18879660	18880860	I'm just glad we did it.
18881500	18882300	Let's go.

18888220	18889100	I'm gonna be annoyed.
18889100	18891900	She's in the top, I'm top seventh on mech assault.
18893420	18895580	I'll tell my, I can tell my dad that.
18895580	18896300	Where's my phone?
18896300	18897500	Oh, my phone's not here.
18898060	18900860	I'll tell my dad that I got the seventh world record
18900860	18902700	on mech assault purely on the basis
18902700	18904380	that no one has submitted for it.
18906540	18908220	And then he'll be mega proud of me.
18910460	18911900	I just checked and it's seven.
18913900	18915100	Yeah, hell yeah.
18915740	18919100	Okay, right, before I continue yappening
18919100	18920380	all your ears off again.
18920380	18921980	So yeah, literally top 10, same top,
18921980	18923900	maybe I won't say seventh, I'll say top 10.
18923900	18926540	I'll be like, I'll talk, I'm top 10 speaker on record me,
18926540	18927340	but what do you mean?

18931020	18933980	I'm gonna watch him take first place tomorrow, honestly.
18934700	18936860	He would probably do that way faster than me.
18938220	18940780	Right, as I said, I'm gonna end stream.
18940780	18942620	It's gonna redirect you into mimosa.
18942620	18946220	For those of you who are a member of Strony Cottle's channel,
18946220	18948860	I am about to take a 10 minute rest
18948860	18950380	to get some food in my belly.
18950380	18952940	And then we're gonna do membership ASMR.

18967340	18969900	a childhood game, so childhoody,
18969900	18973340	that I actually wasn't even able to play it at the time
18973340	18974780	because I was so small and tiny.
18977100	18981180	Okay, imagine checking the speed runner list
18981260	18984940	and finding you lost to a watermelon cuttlefish, honestly.
