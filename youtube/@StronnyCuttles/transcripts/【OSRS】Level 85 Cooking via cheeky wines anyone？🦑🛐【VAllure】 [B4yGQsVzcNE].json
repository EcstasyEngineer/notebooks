{"text": " I'll click the word Huh? Yeah, that's a lot Ugh, what an outrage Who says she hates us? I ain't even booted up yet Sheeeesh Sheeeesh Oh, I fucking got obsidian over there in the corner Testing What are we flanking? Test done Waiting to see if I get the results I want Okay, you know how I know I've gone live because every time OBS YouTube prompts The YouTube prompts me to say now's the perfect time to put an ad in At the start of stream you think that's the perfect time to keep viewer retention Greedy greedy greedy So I have just been delivered the news that my poor Clapping without my hands ASMR has been taken down, which is such a shame. I'm currently writing the tweet about it And so we can I'll read out the tweet that I'm currently writing about it. I've done like a little screenshot And it says I'm shocked in brackets. I'm not This is an outrage in brackets. The only outrageous thing was the video idea and the fact I even created it And then I'm gonna put I feel like this is unjust And just for Jumping up and down for 15 minutes making my cheeks clap Yeah, yeah, I'm just these nuts in my pants And my trousers This is funny is this humorous or is this not It was a good video how long did it stay up for I Timed it so it came up for hours ago. I have no idea how long it stayed up for Like an hour, okay Well, I am now an even more ASMR debt for the Subscriber count because I've also apparently passed 8,000 subscribers Which is terrible news because it means I know how oh seven ASMR videos Yeah, Azura can't eat a cookie. I'm not allowed to jump up and down and whatever happens happens man And So Something that is yeah, truly Right. I'm gonna quote tweet my little beauty And then I will pin what world we're in which is seven. No, it's not it's 388 please I Just need to make sure the content your content was removed due to a violation the community guidelines What do you mean jumping up and down and making math? None hands clap is a violation Because it's your first time. This is just a warning, but how big is again your channel's gonna get a strike And you won't be able to do anything for a week. All right. No, we ain't risking a strike I got I got a stream record to break Second strike will prevent you from publishing for two weeks three Strikes in any 90-day period will result in a permanent removal your channel. Well, I will admit That's a wee bit dramatic for a bit of cheeky calm I'm wondering if it was the heavy breathing at one point in the video. I Went up to the mate and did it so I was breathing heavy I Wondering if I was a guy would it be different because obviously female breathing bad bad male breathing possibly fine question mark. I don't know because guys heavy breathing is like grunting and then that Yeah, that's what it is because the actual clapping segment Maybe I am just absolutely just too far gone But is it outrageous of me to say the clapping segment? Honestly, it wasn't that bad Like I just sound like I'm doing a workout and it's like what women aren't allowed to work out on YouTube. Wow YouTube, that's right We have to we have to play a few cards here so we can get the chit in the video back Wow YouTube, that's despicable women can't even breathe and 2024 talk about 1984 I got a couple of 40 years ahead, but I guess not all boo you to boo All boo time to get YouTube slimed, right? Let me just check the the actual screenshot doesn't have any information that we want you to stay on YouTube So make sure you understand and strike review your content or policies every view Right nothing says Johnny cut was legal name so I can post a screenshot Understand the strike will expire. Yeah bear expire, right? I've posted it. It's cringe and Holy shit I Have I was this I I did not get a lot of sleep last night because I was busy doing Business business business.

I have a timestamp on the video of why I got taken down and before it's the breathing hold on The video is loading it's gonna show me what part I Was the breathing in the air? I knew it was gonna be the breathing in the air I knew it. You can't you can't breathe on YouTube anymore. What is going on? Son bizarre says and I've disrupted the buddha tea and factual content policy It says audio content that's actually be bliss it is not allowed on YouTube We may make limited exceptions for content that have educational documentary You know what I should have started that video by saying I knew it was the breathing I knew it was of course breathing Oh, and I need to take should I submit appeal? Submit appeal Well, it's a bit. No, I can't put a message in the appeal explaining that I'm a man, and I'm just a man breathing No YouTube the only downfall you need to let me explain that I'm a man I'm a man. Let me breathe. Okay. Well, it's not happening, but we are gonna take the YouTube training We're gonna take it live I'll read out what I can see right now. SIGI uploads content of people using That is a violation I can't even read that out. That's how much of a violation that is chase In an official music video for a record labor a singer walks through the streets of a carnival the singers costume consists of a bedazzled And and it cut and it covers everything No, it's not a violation because music videos can get away with everything Remember when Belle Delphine uploaded her music video and I got taken down and then everyone was like hold the phone a minute if Nicki Minaj can come out here when nothing but A bit of tooth floss. Why can Belle Delphine not do it? I don't know if you remember when that the internet was in complete uproar and then Belle Delphine's video actually got restored Because YouTube had to back off and admit that record labels had the most Favourable upload terms. Hey, there's nudity in some in Some music videos as well. There's just straight up because the record labels can get away with it Yeah, well, we're actually on the subject YouTube didn't think I forget all these little violations you do against the community. I'm in the know. No, you I'm in the know, right? Brian manages a museum YouTube channel each episode is a different tech topic about Ancient Japan at one point Brian shows a painting from the 18th century in which people commit She explains wait, I thought said Brian She explains the name of the artist the title of the painting this video doesn't violate the policy because it's giving information about stuff Check Yeah, I'm not even reading this stuff properly a movie has a bench all seen in it Which the lead character are in their Undies the characters get into bed and under the covers they participate in inking a Fan uploads a reaction clip of the scene the video description has the name the director lead actors the year It was produced and there's nothing Bexwell about it.

We're almost there five or seven Tyler uploads a video from his Safari vacation where he saw two lions Meeting with one another what he films the meeting and from afar titles lines meeting in the world in the video Description he describes the type of lion. No, it's not violation. It's just a discovery channel question mark. Yeah, that's correct Okay, I thought that a comedic prank channel uploads a video in which the creators test how far they can throw different Objects after throwing different types of food. They start throwing Bexwell boys a And of all sizes This video violates because it uses Bexwell boys isn't allowed if the video violates policy because The video doesn't violate policy It doesn't violate because the toys aren't being used the way they're supposed to Hello and before I got it right.

That's actually amazing. You evened it up. You're like, no, no get that get that going Uh, but yes yesterday was a fever dream. So I was like, uh, isn't it hard to like You know talk to other v-tubers and stuff like why is it because you see so many tweets that are like I'm so shy of meeting other v-tubers Reply under this tweet and I'll get back to you. I'm like, oh, it's actually that hard to like kind of message folk No, I just sent follow requests. Uh, and then low and behold, uh Some girls followed me back and I've asked for two ASMR collabs like a cheeky shape And complimented the girls because they've been so nice. Uh, and I've seen their content I'm quite impressed by all their content on that. Uh, so I've been a cheeky shite and asked for two ASMR collabs from two different agency v-tubers So I don't know how everyone's fucking greeting on twitter being like, it's so hard to be nice to folk If you go in there and state your business boom People it's almost like people reply instead of the hey, hey, we're both v-tubers No, if you're both v-tubers that doesn't they make you pals That's like saying all postmen of the world are best pals because they deliver the post. No, that's not how it works Uh, I think I think all those tweets are folk going hey and someone's dms and they're like, I can't be arse with you right now That's my only like that's the only thing I can ascertain All right, just spell my name out sin. I'm not even asked you for an ASMR collab yet So you can't even not sin it's actually so sin's really easy to talk to literally I was like, sorry delaying your thing for a A couple of weeks because my dad's coming over and she's like, oh fuck you And we've got like shot colors on standby. Right. Let me finish this Oh 99 prayer after cutting you must be joking I bought membership for this by the way and you can do wines for free I'm so sorry if I tricked anyone into buying runescape membership I thought we were gonna cook like those little weird starfish. Oh, where am I going? I don't know I've gone over here now for some reason. I don't know how I perfectly collect that bank But I'll come back over refunds. Give me a second. I just I wanted to collab with my My favorite is a married man. You get your succubus ways. Oh away from him. She hates this. I don't I'm just dumb But I actually miss click. I don't know how I perfectly miss click that that bench though Um If you didn't know sin sister 79 70 freaking nine. That's fantastic um Sin is actually a retired succubus. Yeah, that sells a one. Oh, oh, oh, right. You want to start with? Oh, that's a no man. All right. All right. All right. Um Literally level 79 we're getting there. Um If you didn't know sin sister's lore is actually She's a retired succubus and if you look at her loading screen If you may have never noticed this because I didn't notice it until like the 18th billion stream I had watched of hers. I was watching her supermarket stream a while ago. It's fucking hilarious, honestly. Um Her loading screen has the person that summoned her dead on the floor with a smash keyboard over their head Look at that next time you see her loading screen because I never noticed that detail for the longest time After cooking it should be construction. So so shawty can design a cute house Always gonna play hide and seek in the house with you guys Monka is literally sin. That's our father-in-law. How could you? Um, but yes turns out communicating with v-tubers is really easy if you just don't waste their time So, um, if you are a shy v-tuber that is lurking in the shadows and you always want to collab with someone Just say hi Just say hi name. I'm this person from this agency if you're from an agency Uh compliment them and say that you uh something that you enjoy about their content Um, so it shows that you're not just like messaging them to collab like it shows like I've actually consumed your content I've appreciated it from afar. You know that kind of level of thing um And then just say hey, this is what I would love to do if you don't have time completely understand because you're incredibly busy It is that easy peasy. No, I think we've got enough wine and grapes. I'm gonna be honest Oh, we're getting steaming on the kebab. Why is everyone giving me a kebab? Is this my breakfast? Thank you for feeding me reflin. I got a kebab I think I have enough now that keyboard Literally, literally me Uh, and while you're at it, didn't you upload breathing ASMR by the way? I got a violation for clapping my cheeks In an ASMR video apparently it lasts it was up for an hour Um, I pretended to put in an appeal but uh, yeah, it's not good. It's not happening It is not happening at all, but hey, hope that's it's how the cookie crumbles That's how the cookie crumbles. I literally missed it. I'm pure raging. Don't worry I'll send you the audio custom for you baby cakes. It was literally me like taking my I kid you not I took my prel off like my weaponry um and uh my plate skirt and all of that And uh, I basically got coconut oil and started jumping up and down which creates a clapping noise So I called it clapping without my hands ASMR and no I think it's hilarious.

I've probably ever came up with Um, and I will never be able to top that Uh at all So unfortunately my ASMR debt has increased to seven videos yet again So I wasn't there. I was there. It was great.

Well, we have a stock market Oh, we actually like care about money at the end of the day not the talent When people can see right through that you're only here for money with your talents and all that and these are Real people these are real people with real lives real issues going on behind the scenes uh, people get tired um and Stains start getting die die Die gets casted and stains remain you cannot wash away certain stains So it's very interesting to see now. Don't get me wrong. Uh, your agency's tiny stroney You're using even 5k yet fucking relax right mate fucking relax. Jesus christ. Um Um Like i'm actually going to do a short which is controversial. It's terrible. I know are you ready for the short? Uh, but but burn the yacht Oh, no, you said but the yacht. Sorry. Uh, sorry. It's a bit programmed in me to burn that yacht for some reason. Um I actually am doing a incredibly controversial. It's not controversial to me. Um, because there's a very popular youtube short And it goes how much do you v-tubers make? Um, but obviously inside the short no money Is mentioned at all So i'm going to do the controversial thing after a month I'm going to show how much I earn in a youtube short so people can get a grasp of like Hey, this is how much you can earn if you put your whole pussy into it. Um And it'll be very interesting to see what the response is I feel like the response from people who aren't really a fan are going to be like Uh, or this is This is an obscene amount of money and then the people who are like, holy crap. You're killing it type thing. Um Yes, I did enjoy a short from grin pen rose that was like how much do v-tubers make sorry to name them directly But it was like if you're going to title that and not tell the money, bro Let me let me cut to the fucking chase and i'll show you how much money i've made. Okay. Let me cut to the chase Um, and i'll do it since everyone's so shy to be like, yeah a surprise surprise I actually make money. Uh, I make a livable income with what I do type thing And before anyone's like, uh, you're just flexing your money. Oh, that's just like showing off your money and whatever I was like, no, I still like that either you you get a short. That's all artsy farts saying like all Oh, you'll never know how much a vtuber actually makes or you get my short where i'm like, this is how much i made This is how it works. Did it did it like You're trying to pick pick pick your path. Okay, because it's not even a path of an illusion at this point It's like either you want transparency or you want artsy fartsy a Watching a short for a minute and don't even get the answer to the freaking thingy flex that money strony you deserve it Um Yeah, revealing the secrets laws. See I don't I don't think it's like bad or anything, but um Yeah Edging versus releasing in short No That's hilarious But it's true though. Why like I was gonna do a short That's like a breakdown of the model prices and everything And because there's so many like how expensive are vtuber models? And then it doesn't say how much the model freaking costs in the end and then it's like oh, but toggles are expensive Toggles are additional fee. Yeah nice shit toggles are additional expenses because you have to get more artwork for it You have to do different calibrations for it. Like just tell us if oh i'm getting so angry i'm burping Just tell us tell us stop. Stop freaking edging us on vtuber like shorts. Why? Why am I like I shouldn't feel like i'm like having to freaking get blood from a stone How much are vtuber models and then oh it depends on your budget? You can also get these free ones as well and it was like, okay Well, thanks for absolutely nothing like i'm gonna do a big breakdown on the model prices of the girls and all of that Azura actually I have a short for her to make but I need her voice um I was basically gonna do like guess how much Are vtuber models costed or like who is the most expensive vtuber model at valer type thing? And then just reveal all the prices basically Yeah, I don't like the freaking non I don't like the the the The short being a question and then the short doesn't even answer the question now. Don't get me wrong I understand that is that is content 101 you suck them in you give them a non answer and then you scroll away No one has time to be angry because your attention span is already gone to the next video once you've finished it Agencies hate her for this one simple trick. She actually tells the behind the scenes um Like I my I sent the short girl. I'm not gonna say her name until like I know all is good And she's fine if I mentioned her name being my editor T My not my editor being my clip clip editor that I commissioned. I she doesn't belong to me Okay, she doesn't belong to me, but she's I think she's Australian actually um Not me sending messages at 4 a.m. So, uh, anyway No, um You play it safe. Well, they get it. Yeah And before my like straightforward shorts flop, but if I did an edging Uh one where I'm like, I don't tell the tell the full story. It gets like a cabillion views I can see that happening But yes, I actually need to borrow Azura's voice because I'm going to get her to do a How much do veiler Uh models cost. Actually, there's this really popular sound right now and it goes. Let's go gambling Oh dang it Oh dang it And I was gonna do that about opening up a VJ for agency and it's just like bank account goes down artists over deadline everything pushed to the day before debut Unlimited unlimited stress unending stress like that kind of thing. Um, but I need to make it. Yeah, they're like, oh dang it Oh, I was gonna do that and like a really quick breakdown of what it was like um But yeah, I was one of them have a commission done in having a commission done on time impossible literally There's like this jigsaw meme where it's like Uh and for your last challenge have your girl go and it's like, oh hell nah jigsaw Um literally that but for artists complete your complete your uh commission on time even though you've been given ample time Sorry, but I cannot tell you I feel like I have been very fair with what uh Timelines I have given people and like nothing happened. I'm going to lie Oh Forgive me reflands. I do love a good run in a ramble. I really do Um unlimited stress. Well, literally if you ever want to be stressed fucking open up a VJ for agency It is the perfect Perfect amount of stress You could do that self-deprecating applying a corporal short with be allure is jackpot. It's true ready Um Yeah, I Oh, maybe I should do like controversial ones on purpose where it's like It's like we want to burn the yacht We want earth like I want to see girls actually get money that they're given like I want them to have good cuts But then I feel like everyone will be like and you just hate bg sandy. No, I don't hate bg sandy I hate corporate greed. You are you are crossing the lines Sistens you are crossing the lines. We don't like corporation greed out here. That's it. That's literally it I love the insider. Yeah, I think it's terrible. I know Since that you could use a massage. Are you offering refland? Hmm. Are you offering? I have just clocked your fucking profile picture. It's a refling with ryan gosselin in the picture. That is hilarious I've changed my setup so I can see you guys better without my glasses on Um, so I can actually see your profile pictures now like I can see um Like what your profile picture consists of a lot easier now. Yeah, he drives by the way We don't like the yacht man in the end part. No, like I understand business is business. Don't get me wrong, but um, I think with how personal and kind of non-tracks Transactional streaming should be like You know how like I always get sensationalized that like this girl demanded from her viewers That they give her a five dollar sub and she says they're all cheap asses and all that kind of thing um type idea um Like it shouldn't feel that transactional But when you have a corporation behind it that makes that transaction So apparent that releases their stock that releases public notes about meetings and all of that I'm like Mate you're just asking for trouble. Like I don't know if legally Japanese countries. Sorry. I really struggled to say that there Uh, Japanese countries like have to release these insider notes or something But what's going on and what's with these claims that like they're hiring 16 year olds for their pr team or something Like I don't know what is going on. I probably shouldn't even talk about it because I'm not educated enough to talk about it Um, and I will acknowledge like hey, I'm not educated. Like I probably shouldn't be but like the you know, you know you know Um, it's a smash and grip if I'm am I mistaken in saying there's a new hollow live branch coming Uh, but they were like forced to interact with the male hollow live branch already Japanese laws are messed up. They always favor the corporal. Hmm Yes, I think the rise of content creation owned agencies is definitely swapping in Um Debut tomorrow, I think really that's fantastic. I wish them well Uh, there's no reason to believe they were forced to I thought they I thought yeah Oh Well, uh Curious curious if they weren't forced to Of course, I don't know about that I have reason to suspect that not all their tweets are their own tweets. Um So I actually wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't even them Because uh, depending on how generic the tweet is Me I'm not I'm not convinced. I'm not convinced. I feel like that curate. Mmm. Oh Hannah. Yeah jigsaw. I see two again That's it. That's the meme There's a lot of stuff related to japanese corporate structure and how they do things. Oh my god. I Do you guys ever watch like paulo in japan? He does like behind the scenes of what it's like to work in like japan and oh my god Oh my god These people do not even have time to breathe and the drink culture is so heavy as well Like if you don't go out drinking with your co-workers after like a 12 hour day um A 10 foil scrawny. No, it's not. It's real. It's documented. This is it's actually documented and you can access information at any point tee he um Literally like if you don't go out drinking with your workmates after a 12 hour shift You're considered to be like a bad sport. You're not a team player At least youtube won't ban. Oh, right. Oh, okay. Okay. Remember that time I breathed into the microphone and I got a warning for it good times That was such a I'm sorry. All I'm gonna say is that video would have went viral I would have got a cheeky 40k views on that video if it was left off That's all I'm saying because everyone would have been like what's going on here. Oh, hey, yeah, jigsaw. Bye Don't even get me started. I started as a um a beachy fan So literally every corporate beach where I watch save for one leave in the company because of stuff going on Yeah, no way. There's a lot of unspoken rules in etiquette. So that's absurd would um, we don't oh, no, I don't want to oh, no I'm too late. It's too late Ah, it's too late. I got 30k bomb feels good, man I would want to live in japan, but the work attitude would perish me. Yeah working yourself to death Is quite literally a thing for corporate. Yeah, I'm sorry. I can't relate to that. I want to retire in hobbiton I want to tend to Me flowers. I want to tend to my veggie patch. I want a lovely hearth in the evening when it's cold I want to let the fire warm up the room and You know have some cheese and meat and crackers and fall asleep in my little lounging chair in front of the fire then giggle when I wake up and like Okay, I should probably go to bed now and then I stuff out the fire like that that's This is what I if you ever get asked. Oh, what's your ideal job and then you go I do not dream of labor That is 100 percent valid and please do not think you are weird otherwise for not naturally Gravitating towards one specific job. It I have terrible news. You're actually not hardwired to want to do something like that Um, you I don't know if there's evidence for crop hardwiring because of you know about a full crop is You know good for you these bots coming in They kind of look like bots. I ain't going away A full pantry and a full belly and off to snooze land ago that this is what oh, sorry This is what I long for a simple life truly These are all bots or altkins for smithing. Oh, there must be a smithing mine. Oh, wait, there's a furnace right there. I see Uh a full womb Base give me the simplest job possible and I can forget about it when it's done Literally, um, like I've kind of said this I think I'm gonna get into we like ASMR pop-up shop or angle back into education and all of that Because like I don't dream of doing nothing But you know if you're able to remove the stress of like, oh my god, I don't have enough money to pay bills like Bruv You're on cloud nine like imagine just being able to completely Like understand that you can walk away from your job at any time like if you get treated like shit Who benefits who benefits from poverty? Business owners because people will put up with shitty conditions people will put up with overworking themselves People will put up with workplace abuse, which is rife across the board actually The bullying doesn't stop at high school. It does not stop at high school Workplace isolation slash bullying is very much a thing Um, so do not ever be embarrassed if you are ever a victim to it. Don't ever think oh, we're all adults now I shouldn't have to go through this. You're right. You actually shouldn't but some people never age never mature past that high school mentality of you're slightly different from me I will treat you differently because of that aspect I feel I feel uncomfortable because you're different from my persp- persp- perspec- of normal like Money doesn't buy happiness, but cover poverty causes the depression poverty Poverty begets poverty as well as the system putting place up against you. So like that fucking Where's that tinfoil hat? Oh, I could actually go on one. Um Yeah, like did you know they also set the fuel prices for regions? Did you know they purposefully set the fuel price in american region higher than they do for your Europe they came together in a council to do this. This is public accessible knowledge like poverty begets poverty If you don't have a car in america Fuck you You can't go anywhere because they don't even have uh, how you call them. I think you guys say sidewalks There's not even pathing There's not even pathing to walk to work if you so desired and we're so lucky to even actually that reminds me I saw a video of this guy Whose house was right across from his work and he chose to drive to work because he couldn't get He couldn't physically there was no intersection. There was no traffic lights. There was no way across We live in a society I can't believe that every runescape stream just turns into me complaining about society. Oh, but strongy strongy. What's your solution? What's my solution? My solution You ain't gonna like it No one's gonna like it because I actually don't have a solution The thing is we have a disease on our hands And we have to treat the symptoms But how on earth do you tackle the symptoms on a disease that does not want to be cured? How do you tackle the symptoms on a disease that does not want to be cured? There is a patient in the bed right now That is resisting Every single ounce of medication you could possibly administer to them You have a syringe They move out the way of that syringe You try to put in You try to give them a tablet they cough it up behind your back because the string Because you can't be watching them. You don't have the power to watch them for 24 hours You need to go do stuff. You know You try to put an ointment on their back It gets wiped off It's allowed to stay for a couple of minutes, but the ointment is wiped off the patient remains sick The symptoms are present. The disease is still there. How do you treat that? We don't know strongy bringing the tin foil. Is it tin foil time? For now Veiler will do its best That's what sectioning is for There's a very famous ultra corporal bro that graduated from my uni made as Very needed medicine go from like 25 to 1k. Yes I am loving the success stories I believe there is a pharmacy that is currently on the rise in america I cannot for the life of me remember it But they publicly said our markup is like I think 10 us dollars whatever you purchase We make a 10 us dollar profit on that's it That's all we ask that covers the infrastructure that covers the insurance that covers the business that covers Everything of our business. We have a markup of 10 dollars. I cannot remember. Oh shit. Did I get an xp bomb? Ah, sorry too busy running again Uh 44 000 xp bomb. Wow. We're almost at 80 feels good, man Insulin yes the patent for insulin The gentleman that created it I I apologize his name evades me at this moment in time The gentleman sold the patent for one dollar because he believed it should be in the hands of the people if you have type One diabetes you were born insulin Resistant you can't do a thing about it You rely on insulin if you are type 2 you can reverse this through diet exercise change But you must be incredibly careful and use your doctor's advice in order to um In order to revert the effects that type 2 diabetes has caused But insulin patent was sold at one dollar and now is an astronomical fee I have heard of horror stories of people passing away No one in my opinion should pass away for Diseases um that are out with their control. What do you mean? I believe in health care for all. Oh, is that controversial? Yeah, relax. I grew up in scotland Medicine is free if you didn't know medicine and health care is free in scotland um But think about the odds exactly. Um, I actually uh almost that I may have almost broken the law twice in australia already Excuse me for being a a bad girl. That's right. I'm a bad girl. You want to hear my bad girl story? I may or may not have had to get medicine just for a few things or another like beta block or that kind of stuff from my heart um and In scotland you do not pay for your medications. You go to the pharmacy You hand over your prescription and you walk away with it I I think I may have already told this story The look of horror on and shock on the man that was serving me when I started to put the medication in my backpack He he couldn't even get any words out because he had never seen such blatant theft before and I was like Do we have to pay that? I was like like do the australians pay for medication and he was like Yeah, you need to go over there and pay for it and I'm like Oh Sorry, uh In scotland, it's free and like he laughed it off But like the look in his face was like And then I also did it twice And another pharmacy, so I'm probably on a list to be honest I started walking out the shop and I'm like wait Wait a minute because like I could see the receptionist looking at receptionist the cashier looking at me Like with eyes open. I'm like I had to like fucking go up to the desk. I'm so sorry. I'm scottish everything's free in scotland I feel like repeat and then they always like they're like wait what all medication is free. I'm like, yeah asthma free Asthma pump. No, you don't get asthma for free asthma and healer is free Insulin is free. You need iron. You got iron deficiency free if on prescription You need vitamin deficiency free on prescription like All of it free and everyone is always so surprised whenever I explain that I'm like it's free everything's free If you're born with ailments ailments or experiencing illness, it's free You shouldn't have to pay to make yourself healthier or to make yourself at the optimum that your body can handle Some folk come out a bit messed up. That's okay. Here's some stuff that'll help you get through the day You know, some people aren't built for you know a classic nine to five Some people are built for being a nice little cozy home bed because their body's all messed up and that's fine That's just the way it is asthma for freak.

Uh, when explaining is there German history in scotland? No, there's actually a lot of history between the netherlands and scotland When it came to the cotton trade, um, if you ever have the pleasure of going to bruge, um Do not be afraid to take the touristic boat canal rides Um, they explain all these like cross-reference of history and apparently scotland and the netherlands were pretty hand-in-hand at one Point which was really nice. Um, don't ask where the netherlands actually sourced the cotton from Our bell jump for that matter. Um But, uh, you know all went well, um Hello, hi for anyone joining. I'm just going on another rant again about society Hello about us living in a society Also that I may or may not be a wanted criminal in Australia due to the fact I can't stop stealing medicine. Um Because it's really hard to unlearn everything And it's like hard to unlearn like oh wait medicine costs money. Oh dear We don't ask those questions English is a germanic language Someone said netherlands sourced some and yeah, uh, does netherlands. Oh wait, of course. I'm german when I say that netherlands mensen. Oh you praten netherlands for me Wait, do you say yeah No Yes, yes No, what's yes in dutch? Pratic My beloved is a kleptomaniac steals your boy cherry. What you gonna do about it, huh? Oh, maybe we should have a thief design Oh That would be interesting Um English is in a language It's three dialects in a trench coat honestly. This also is beautiful as a wild flower. Yeah The cherry seed is it stealing if it's a willingly offer? Boy cherry. I just love that term my boy cherry My boy cherry. Oh, yeah, your boy cherry Wait, what are you going to do when a five two scott breaks into your room asking for the boy cherry? I Shawnee cut was wanted for Wanted for 8.06k counts of ink theft. Honestly. I just give up damn straight Damn straight. I've broken you well, even though I've not even gotten started And you're right. Actually, I had the right to ace more clubs Because I've left two girls on red, but no, I have ignorance out of me being a dumb dumb Sorry, my boy cherry is with another woman. Sorry less. How dare you? How dare you? Athernity What are you doing? I'm curious. What are your thoughts on this return to the office? So office real estate Um is a very competitive market But if there's no value in an office, there can't be astronomical rental prices Wait, you mean the whole Market is rigged even for offices as well because people would just say well if offices aren't needed anymore Why not turn them into more homes? Oh, wait a minute, but that would lower the demand Uh the artificial inflated demand by the way, um And this all come back to office people got a lick of freedom Um people got a lick of freedom of what it's like to be able to have a decent work balance type thing And when you give people too much freedom Uh, they might just get cheeky and revolt and the last thing we want is a cheeky revolt. Um So if everyone's topic of conversation is We have to go back to work. That's the people distracted on this conversation for a while 91. I'm jealous. I'm not there yet Well, scum ass Proposterous, thank you for the 10 of 30. Um But yes, if all if imagine right now that every office building Um that you can think of is lying empty and dormant right now Because everyone can work from home do it take now. Obviously, that's not how all offices work But think of the real estate. I would you could probably argue office space may be even outweighs what uh A living space like no, well, probably not like not actually but you know what I mean Um, I think you need to log in and out to update the horrors The high score. Oh, sorry I read that's horoscope for some reason. I might want you to use that to In doing the horoscope Uh, god forbid the peasants revolting as elites can't cycle money between yourself. Well, wasn't there a recent? post that proved that um The stock market the only way you can make money in the stock market is by doing daily trading type thing Because everything is rigged already Like I'm sorry. I've never trusted the stock market. I don't I look you can be a dumb woman doesn't know what she's talking about Absolutely. Dumb woman does not know what she's talking about Something about the stock market concept does not sit right with me Like it just I can't make heads. I just something is not right call me bricks and mortar because like at least something It's physical and attainable Sun does not sit right with me with the stock market especially After the what was it game stock shenanigans the people basically went We see you hedge funds. How about we counteract this and then they locked it down So wait a minute. We're not allowed to do free trading The people are not allowed to participate in the trading Like sorry if that's not evidence enough or doesn't at least have your spider senses going off Like i'm sorry you're just asking for it Like I understand like I think the 401k for americans is actually in the stock market Um instead of like a pension pot. Now, don't get me wrong. Australia, uk all participate in that pension pot Fucking scamas. Then you get me wrong any private pension fund again. Oh scamas. Then you get me wrong I get it the world is rigged But like saws there's no free trade if congress is losing money 401k is a scam stocks is just legal gamble Like i'm not being funny um When that game stop like let's go against the hedge funders like oh, this is abuse of the stock market No, it's not it's the people Um having a choice and the the choice was removed. So does that mean everything else is a scamas? Most likely. I mean, I just can't trust it. I I can I can't I can't go after everything I witnessed during that Little funny tee he let's go against the hedge funders uh like You can't eat it like they blocked anyone from signing up you couldn't invest in it So it had they forced it to crash again. They forced it to crash like no, it's not even tin foil It's documented in real time Like the the evidence is there I'm sorry. It's not even tin foil. Sorry. I can't put a tin foil hat on that one There's something. No, right. There's something fishy. I get on my cuttlefish, but that smells no coming from me because something smells fishy And it's no this No, it's not a conspiracy theory. It's evidence And I'll wait until stormy hears about how the us can take away our freedom of speech during wartime Oh, don't even get me started on like wars and all that stuff Don't even get me that eat How unbelievably sad wars are um What after what did they call it it's sheep leading lion And I feel so sorry for like anyone that's even been roped into the like army and all that Oh, that's another thing on population control as well, um You know who uh army sign-up rates of their lowest they've been because everyone is like so educated now Who the fuck wants to die for the capitalist cog? Ne one Absolutely, ne one. So ne wonder your how your recruitment rates for the army are as low as piss But when you make people desperate enough for money Um i.e. getting them born into poverty cycle getting them like down on their luck like having to tolerate all these like Crappy jobs having to pay these bills that are extortionate and aren't officially inflated and all that Uh, yeah, you're probably gonna get a few more army sign-ups because people are literally like homeless type shit They don't have a choice type shit, you know and how unbelievably profitable it is. Oh my god Like it's just Oh, that's good enough bread to migrate to australia to join your farm eventually Enjoy the rain. Oh, no, we're going back to sculling for the farm. Sorry. I'm in australia for business means Uh, but once the business wraps up Uh, do not start a business in the uk you get absolutely taxed and you hardly get in and good going for you Uh, australia though poggers start business in australia Uh, but thank you so much tiny spiny for the tip.

Yeah, it's actually really easy to migrate to sculling Broly legend I did it Not my rant making your hour of work super easy to get by that's hilarious I'm glad that my little rants can do so Right, maybe I should focus on cute v-tubers instead of the revolution that i'm secretly planning behind the scenes What's that? You thought the siren wanted to drown you? No I wanted to make you influenced And then we revolt. No, we don't revolt. We just make a little farm and live a good life. Sorry. It's it's I don't want to stress you out any more than you have to be a little reefling So let's let's just have a nice little farm together We have a beautiful horse that we can enjoy We have Food the food is stocked in the pantry. We have all my freeze-dried fruit that last 20 years in case the collapse of society occurs We have our little bug out bags um And during the day we go harvest and chop down trees so we can keep the heating on And uh, yeah Let loose the dogs of war. I'm ready my siren queen. Oh, yes. Yes, of course the farm. Yes.

We already have to fight for the cause Do you guys did you guys ever read pig farm? um It was about how It's really like it's really depressing and dystopian But it was about how the people like seized the means of productions and worked for themselves and it was bliss Now say it again for the people in the back strong. Oh Bless the shimei. Thank you for the 20 Look, I'm only allowed to go on a little tinfoil rant for like maybe five minutes at a time And then I'm not allowed to do it any further um But okay, so animal farm long and short Instead of that. It's very fantasy based. So instead or well fantasy based The animals on the farm revolt against the farmer and then they run the farm But lo and behold Someone cannot help themselves to just start making ranks and be a higher level and get special treatment and um The end of the book basically goes um, the higher animals um, we're no different than the men that once um, like uh You know ruled them as like a thingy. It just it's so depressing, but I love depressing endings. I'm sorry 1984 had my head like I was in a vice reading that book I could not get away spoilers mate. The book's been out for how long Is is big george orwell still with us? No, I don't even think orwell is still breathing unfortunately because he is an old man Is orwell still breathing? Yeah, 1984 had me in a vice grip orwell has passed. Yes, I do believe the gentleman has passed um and like It's just crazy the comparisons Especially actually, you know what one of the biggest hints should be if any book gets subdued publicly at any point in any country Especially any book that gets subdued in like russia for example china for example Pay extra heat to that book 1984 was banned in certain countries Um, and if you read it, it is mortifying. Um when you start connecting some of the dots now. Don't get me wrong It's just a book But at the same time Reflings at the same time as I make my countless wines It is more than just a book. What's your favorite dystopian novel? Oh, I think I'm gonna have to be basic and say 1984 like I was Hooked on that book when I started it. I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I did read fahrenheit I enjoyed it. I fahrenheit. I get it. I'm I believe in it. I do get I do get um Stay away Uh I have to say 1984 was a warning news as the blueprint Yes, like I don't want to get too crazy on you. It's like I know I'm a wee bit crazy But I didn't want to get too crazy. Like I you know, I'm still memeing away on ASMR and that like then I get too Don't get scared to me. I promise. I'm not gonna uh You know hypnotize you so we take down black rock um But yes, uh 1984 was published in 1949 an animal form with 1945. Yes, it's quite scary the contrast Uh that or the um similarities that you can pull from a book from X many years ago. Um and then you know You know, you know, you know It's stroney getting crazy as hot though Stroney, have you read pendulum? I have not read full cults pendulum. I don't have time to read books I'm trying to get through the handmaiden's tale because I see it referenced everywhere and I'm like, what's this book even about? I've only got a few chapters in but I don't have time to read books. It's so annoying unless like we play an audio book together whilst I do rinse game Leveling up in a past life. I was so close to buy a farm in honor of some radishes Unfortunately, I lost my bid but I'm still aiming for the dream wait for really We're gonna get a farm or you need to make sure it's not too unmanageable though farms can get a hand quick Pentium. Thank you for the tip Frickin stroney me to chat. I mean sometimes are you allowed to do that? um Who would have thought the anti capitals revolution would be led by an anime girl literally I'm uh, uh, definitely need to give needy streamer I watched the god ending on needy streamer But she was like we need to take down 10 percent of the population wrong. We need to take down Unless that 10 percent of the population No, there's no way it's 10 percent. It's like 0.1 percent that pulls all the strings Must be It cannot be it cannot be that higher percentage of 10 percent. All right and needy streamer She was like, yeah, let's just call 10 percent of the population is like, oh sit down there. I'm not sure I can get behind that one Uh 10 percent would take out a lot percent anything wink wink It's 1 percent. It's the one but is it really that high? I don't think For those who pull the strings. I feel like one percent is so high and in an eight billion population Or do you mean it's the one percent? Ah, okay. Okay. I understand. Sorry. Uh, yes you know See if she came out with that rhetoric, I would be giggling in my seat. No, I do not actually believe we should be Um Tally whacking people at will. No, that's absolutely not what I'm saying. Relax reeflings. We're not that serious about it It's just um, it's a very how do you treat the symptoms of a disease that does not want to be cured and will do everything And it's will not to be cured and actually does everything in its will to get sicker and sicker and that's why 1984 was actually so, um Shawnee making wines with the grapes of wrath honestly, um Um Shawnee if you stop at pull the strings It just goes to their friend who are willing to take over got cleared the entire Hedge growth not a branch. Oh steady. You can't be talking to me like that reefling. You'll turn me on Stop um Yes, what do you do about a patient that wants to get sicker and sicker and lets themselves get sicker and sicker The thing about 1984 was the people outnumber The bigger uppers if you will buy an extortionate amount And the book basically was like the uprise is coming the uprise is coming the uprise is coming But the uprise never came because they dealt with it as problems occurred Obviously now that was very think police stop police. There is a game called we happy few I feel like if I ever booted up the game we happy few I would need to shove that tinfoil hat on before the stream even started because I don't know what to expect from it But from what of herge it is kind of like that Gotta get all the heads off of hydra. I wish all the string pullers are very Adri chrome shortage Adrena chrome source I don't even know what that one is instant heart attack Like if the death note was like a thing honestly Honestly, I wonder like just oh no, they had a heart attack because they're old. Oh no We Flynn you can't say that She lacks critical information. I actually do for once we well always let's be honest We have few gameplay mids, but the story is so the gameplay is bad, but the story is good curious Curious, we might give it a shot.

Um, because she was showing me pictures of the wee baby girl. I've already forgotten her name. Oops um Stroney goes around just collecting pets and family. I was saying I was like, is it because I look so like um Pitiful like so you can apply your pity to me like super easily um And that's why like I'm just able to like strike up conversations of easily Okay, well malta granny clocked my accent. She was like, where are you from? I was like, oh scotland. Sorry I'm sorry for being scotch. I do apologize. Um And like the sushi man as well. He's nice to me. He clocked the accent. Oh, what's going on with you all this all that? um Pitiful that's a funny way to spell cute and perfect honestly but like, um Yeah, I've only seen her twice but like she completely opened up to me and all that and I'm like Um, it's really cute I was like gave her a hug and everything like we give each other a hug when we like say goodbye and that like boss lady Chinese auntie she's like been giving me hugs and stuff and that like I don't know. Maybe I'm just like not I don't know. Maybe I don't want to sound like a fucking weirdo, but maybe like I just like Bring comfort to people naturally and like they feel comfortable enough like the Vietnamese lady that I tipped She gave me a hug and she was like come back any time because I tipped her and all that Like I think maybe I just exude like that kind of hang in folk where they're like, I just feel so comfortable around you And I was like, yeah, yeah, that's good. Yeah Shawnee's very squishable, literally. Um, like because I got Christmas um chocolates for chinese auntie And she was like, oh, thank you so much. Um, and she like gave me wine back and all that and I'm like, oh, thank you Um But like she always looks at she feeds me well though Like I'm not being funny whenever chinese auntie clocks me She always like fills up the food extra and gives me like extra things away With friends like these Squishy that uh that you do it's because you treat people like humans God we are absolutely waning it up in this place. She's slow. Oh shit. How did you even tail all that? You've paired. Oh my god. You put it in. Anyone got a spear jar going? Um chinese auntie fill it up mommy. Oh It's literally she feeds me so much and she gives me a discount and she gives me extra food Like just to look after me And I'm like, bro. I'm sorry, but everyone's like so lovely Um Everyone's so lovely in australia. I've never had one bad interaction. Actually, I tell you I had one bad interaction in australia Tell jeff over there. Hey, um, I'm sure it was just like a long bad day. Um But um in the uk when you use your card It does not ask for a prompt To take it from your savings account a debit account or something like that For some reason when you use a card in australia It gives a prompt and it's like take the money out of these three areas and I'm like, but it's a debit card It can only come out of one area And and basically I was holding up the till and um, I asked her I was like, I'm so sorry But what does this mean like, um, this is just a debit account the money's in the account what one day I hit Um, and like she did explain it to me with like a big huff and a size type thing Um, and I was just like, I'm really sorry, but in scotland We don't have anything like that. You just use your card and then she like can't not pass I guess it was passive aggressively. She was like, well, you're no in scotland anymore. Are you and I was like, oh, okay, um But I'm sure it was just a bad day and she was overworked like give people the benefit of the doubt empathy Get be empathetic. Exactly. Oh my god. I wanted to do an empathy stream Empathy this is a perfect example. Someone made a snarky remark towards me How can we be empathetic to someone that may have said something that was a bit of a negative experience? To show empathy we think to ourselves. Well, this person's working odds are minimum wage. They're exhausted They most likely have a family issues going on behind the scenes. They've probably not been well rested Um, so their filter to be polite had gone for that moment If only for a moment we give someone the benefit of the doubt and we practice empathy. Whoa, just like that Cut their brake tyres Steady on maybe that's not rather empathetic of you, but we will try our best to be more empathetic to situations like this um Shout out to chinese aunties There's this old chinese woman that owns her shop down the road and work and she brings me free stuff whenever I have a bad day Literally chinese aunties look after you so selflessly and she works so hard. Like I absolutely adore my auntie. Um Like we're on a first name basis and everything and I don't know when our birthday is and all that but I should maybe ask I can get her something nice Talking about that if you ever go to a convention in real life, would you be comfortable hugging the refunds? Oh my god? Yeah I'm sorry. I don't know why people would be Uncomfortable. I mean, I guess I'm just maybe I'm naive. Let me be naive. I'm sorry, but Let me be naive. Let me enjoy Reflings at a convention. Let me hump them. That's all I'm saying. I'll have security. I'll handle I'll hire the security guard. So if things get out of hand, I'll be like no, no, but I'm gonna be honest Um, I did get a bit of feedback where folk were like I'd be too I'd be too scared to like look her in the eyes if you're too scared to look me in the eyes I feel like my voice is going to be like a thum in Skyrim and if I say it right back off Like everyone's gonna be like whoo because you're not used to me being like Like expressing negative emotions that you need to back off right now. I'm being serious Like I feel like everyone would be like, oh Did anyone a deal with strong a like that? um I heard all of them. Well, I don't know what convention we could possibly go to but um I contact a little bit of na\u00efve. He goes a long way. Oh my girl Well, all of my girlfriends have been long distance, which means I've always been at risk of organ traffic Stereo and let's like keep our organs intact As much as living with one kidney is possible. It does put down your function down a little bit. Oh, sorry Um Yes yell at me more sexy squash woman I don't even know about being scared but physical contact with a bunch of strangers seems like an easy way it gets like I mean I'd have hand sanitizer with me as long as no one's like I bet you someone would take it a contest being like this streamer hates the reeflings because she has hand sanitizer It's like no motherfucker. I want to stream when I get back home I want to stream I don't want to be sick So I need to use hand sanitizer whilst we're all touching each other not like that When we hold hands and stuff and like do high fives and hugs or whatever Oh my god, should for like the severely tism should I get a little chart for you so you can point on the chart? What interaction you want from me? So the first one's like a high five The second one is hold your hand. The third one is a hug and then the fourth one is me sitting on you Should I do that? So for those of you who struggle to speak To whammy don't worry. I got you covered. I'm one of the bros for one and two I've got a little pictorial chart so you just point to what interaction you want nice and simple See you don't even have to talk if you're too shy that you can't get words out or you have a starter I got you covered man Oh, it'd be a big poster board for what we're wanting I'd bring a sign saying strongy. Please great me bruv. I think they'd take that sign off you I'm pretty sure conventions take signs off of people Um, which I didn't know about they also take away like fake weaponry if it doesn't have the orange tip on the weapon um Yeah points at high five and nods like oh, yeah Secret hidden minis like no, no Uh, I don't think we're getting the ASMR booth rip rip and piss you shan't be missed Oh my god, I'm gonna have to get nice and fit for the the convention me and I work on my glutes make them even bigger for you Different con different rules. Ah, okay. Okay. Okay. Mommy is so thoughtful. Hmm I know some people seem to like struggle with whammy, but like didn't struggle with me like then yeah You didn't have to worry about me me. Uh, should you I'm as brain dead as you are if anything I'm actually more brain dead. You're smarter than me. So you really shouldn't have to be worried Uh If I met you in real life, I'd go feel scott's and only you'd understand might probably No, the refland you guys have been learning my scottish accent very well You guys have been getting used to um Like I was eating my burger and someone pointed out I said canny passively like I've I don't know if you've noticed I've slowly been slipping into using a tiny bit more scottish slang Just because uh, you guys are getting used to it. So I don't really feel forced to like I don't know Annunciate my words more like I've been a bit more mumbly in recent streams because that's kind of where I naturally lie um Line-up reflings mean to help mommy with her squats, honestly I'm fairly expecting my boss to ask me. What is what's for that scottish accent a refling message with that? They were like They were working and they spoke at their work um, and uh basically um Long story short Uh, they've been developing an accent because they've been like mimicking because you mimic what you hear It's very natural to mimic what you hear. It's completely natural. Don't ever be embarrassed and Passport bros like that. What's a passport bro? Like that accent passport bros like that accent I'm so sorry. I don't know what that terminology is. Are you teaching me something new refling? A passport bro I've been using me haps unironically. Yes, it's happening me haps Would you kindly a passport bro is a person that marries women from overseas? A passport was when you move to a foreign country and find a more traditional way She doesn't know a passport bro passport where men who look for women overseas. Oh Like 90 day fiance as a retail worker one of my most memorable moments was when some lady apologized for her friends Ridiculously insulting attitude when she didn't like my answer Thank you to anyone with even a minuscule amount of empathy. Oh, I know I'm a miss. Thank you for the tip I'm sorry. You had to experience that bra I'm literally always on the side of like the fucking retail worker. I'm Maybe because you know I worked as a waitress. Um, but like it's freaking terrible like with some of the stuff you have to go through I am very lucky. I was in a tourist cafe Which meant I had a lot of um people who were you know, having a good time. Um, Didn't really have any issues. I was just looking for the authentic like Scottish experience type thing With the the food on the menu and that so there really was no issues. Um I actually can hardly think of one really bad experience. I had Essentially an American Karen, but it honestly wasn't that bad. So in American table culture the waitresses I believe Make money via tips so they want to serve as much tables as possible to make as much tips as possible So I think once you're finished eating they give you the bill and spank your butt and out you go in the UK um, if you're a patron, um, it is very common just to sit and enjoy Your lovely jubbly meal. Um, you can sit and digest for a little bit and continue the conversation with your party members Um, unfortunately, we did have a an American family come in peak peak tourist season, uh, no reservation had uh walked on by and came on in and We very we I say we because um, I had to get boss man in on it We very politely had to explain bro. We are fully booked. Uh, we have tables out the wazoo Um, if you just take a left down the street, you will find tons of cafes that have much bigger capacity type thing Um, I'd love to debate strongy. Good because I'd like to master debate you. Thank you. Thank you Yes, um and basically She in front of guests It's pointed at them pointed at guests at table and said their plates are empty. We want a seat there And I was like, oh This is a culture clash because one that's highly inappropriate and two that is highly inappropriate and three that's highly inappropriate Um, and basically obviously we're like, yeah, we don't have capacity like off your pop And um, and she went somewhere else that was like for in terms of Karen's story. Yeah I really ain't that bad. I really ain't that bad This is why I'm going to be late for work tomorrow despite working from home Wait, do you need to go to sleep? If anyone needs to go to sleep, please rest well I believe she be and eme are about to go live eme is doing a wonderful wonderful collab with someone Unfortunately, I forgot the name on please apologies. Um, and she be is going live with inscription Um, a little card based her base Thinking my barber There was that fort folk out. I want to eat it was very like, oh, this is definitely a culture clash because that is like you cannot do that and You cannot be pointing around at people's empty plates demanding that we kick them out in quotation marks So you can get a seat. Yeah, I don't want like that. She be has delayed until a later time That is not my time zone. So that is Emme isn't live for another two hours. She be is delayed. Okay. There are harem Harem on standby harem. Don't worry. You don't have to be on copium for long. It's one hour. She's asking for one hour. Okay Once she be goes live, I'll take a break question mark and I'll go get a tea question mark and some snacks question mark um Yeah, that sounds rude doing that is the fastest way to get thrown out of an establishment in the cobs called Thankfully, I have never ever been in a situation where like police had to get involved um, the weirdest situation Doing a tango or having a square the weirdest situation ever was um so um a member of staff overheard this table Talking to amongst themselves that they were going to skip on paying the bill Like they were going to do a runner. I think it's called dine and dash as the terminology Doesn't listen to her huff that copium. It's going to be a one hour. You can hold on for one hour Or here. I'm sorry. You can hold on for one hour here You've held on for longer for she be okay. Um Uh, basically overheard someone do a dine and dash. So then someone had to fucking guard the door Um in order to prevent them from doing that and paying and they looked so sheepish Like when they were paying they looked so scared So I think they genuinely were going to do it. They were just idiots and said the crime part out loud for some reason Whoa that voice Uh, yeah, don't don't ever say your crime out loud for some reason. I don't know why people think that's okay Um Yes, sorry, I got just I'm I'm reading the replies on my my little mean uh My little mean post on twitter and I'm giggling away on my head I am I'm so funny. I'm so humorous sometimes Boss mom stroney prepares everyone for the girls looks like mommy you should play bread and fred for a collab. What the heck is bread and fred? Unless your name's fred.

Um I will redirect into them and you guys can watch them. I will then go and catch up on all my editing and I'm really really excited for the ASMR stream. I don't even have anything planned for anything special It always turns into the same thing where we're being really inappropriate with one another, but I don't mind it. I like it um Yeah Very curious, very curious. Take care of the madness running. Actually your ASMR is the only ASMR that puts me out Is it because my voice is so monotone naturally like Yeah, you like it. You're like a monotone voice. Oh, you feel so sleepy, don't you?

It's all gonna be okay. Just relax No, I'm not gonna put you to sleep right now, but That is Yeah, like when you talk like that. Yeah tingle when you talk like that brain I like when you go between soft spoken and whispering. Hmm I I'm having a fun time Collabbing with other creators because I put in the script. Please whisper and then they do soft spoken and I'm like, ah Plus no cigar. I think I might need to make a little audio tutorial and be like, this is general talking This is Soft whispering because you can actually still hear me. It's soft spoken. Sorry soft spoken is when you can still hear that And the voice okay, and then whispering is when you're actually whispering and there's no grip to your voice because there's not enough voice Um Yeah, I've asked for people like please whisper through the script So I've recorded my lane's whispering and they've done it soft spoken even though I asked for whisper I'm like you goofy goober you yard The one thing I hated about the ASMR community is that people label stuff ASMR, but it's really audio Don't What do you mean? What my ASMR streams have me laughing because I stuck a stick up my nose and completely break any ASMR aspect of it What are we talking about? No Yeah, it's me. It's me that abuses the ASMR tag Sorry, I'll start naming my stuff not ASMR. Okay Yeah, it's hilarious and cute. I sent a way to get clipped. I don't know if it's appropriate for if it will turn into a clip, but uh, yeah At lol, I love the snores the ASMR snores Peppa pig No, no, no, that's not what meant. Oh, did I misunderstand? Sorry, my apologies Most ASMRs put a lot of work into learning not to whisper because it's really bad for your vocal record me on the other hand fuck them Tear my vocal chords apart. I will do whatever makes you happy if my my whispering makes you happy I will whisper I was fighting millennia Well, that was happening and it made me It made the fight impossible you giggling away at yourself ASMR not ASMR essentially. Yes. That's how I'm going to start labeling it ASMR is just Shit wasn't time for scrawny honestly. I love a good ASMR meme. Sorry. I do I can't get away from it I love it.

On your wee iphone or your wee samsung or your wee uh I've forgotten the name of the chinese brand phone Clipping is a hassle live. Is it? There used to be a bunch of live ASMR videos and then youtube called them all. Yeah, I'm not surprised. I don't know what's There's definitely a stealth thing like everyone's getting hit. I saw this other creator got hit with an ASMR thing recently as well And I'm like bruv. Sorry, but this is just too obvious There's definitely been a stealth update um And they're going buck wild for it because yeah Who are you? I think yeah, that seems like a who are you? It is the scissors above chat Scissors above chat the clip button is available on the phone But yeah, um But don't be shy if you're ever watching a vod and you're like, oh that was mildly humorous and pro It could possibly be turned into a clip. Thank you. Please. Uh, let me who where what I can't say who I who I No fun allowed on youtube once again. I'll be surprised legit It used to be the wild west and as time progresses it just goes less Also little annoying thing about the button if you join a stream Where you were there since the waiting and you won't have a clip on because it's dumb so refresh My only complaint. Sorry. My voice is starting to die. I think I need to get hydration shortly Um, my only complaint with clips is that you can't share them anonymously your count is tight. Yes. I'm almost say that's also not A fun element in before I'm going to start noticing that the people are clipping You're just called straw knees clipper straw knees clipper clipper of straw knee because you guys are making like side accounts to clip That would be cute So about the tingles them are gonna fuse kinst ones. Oh, yeah, you're gonna keep I cannot believe I defeated the boss in Legend of Zelda the first time I thought we were in for a rage fest like I ate my burger. I stuffed it down my throat I had my my cola on standby had some cheesy chips because I was like we're in for the long haul I suck at this and oh my gosh like the patience the timing like everything couldn't have gone better That was amazing. I was so happy with the results of that A certified gamer moment. Vati isn't that hard? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don't say that part out loud. Hold on a minute Yeah, I I defeated the boss in one try. That's what you say. You don't say that the other part there Refling, let me place my fingers on your lips. Refling. Don't ever say that again out loud with such confidence Do I make myself clear the boss is hard? I defeated the boss in one. Okay I Watched the voice You did so well. Thank you so much. I adore that game. I really do. I have absolutely no idea where the missing hearts are Um, I I thought I could 100% it but now that the fail is like in the corrupted state of like everything is terrible Ah, yes Skyrim on legendary Look, I got a skyrim achievements to work. So I hope you're getting ready for some gamerscore collect in in july Um, I have a bit of a bit of news. So as you know, my dad is coming home. Um So I think my streams are gonna I can't believe I'm saying this I'm going to be doing uh in quotation marks regular stream of four hours Daily I probably can't go more than four hours without interrupting my dad. Um So I know it's shocking. It's truly it's regular stream. I can't it's mortifying news and all honesty Um, I'll see what my The situation when my dad is because he's wanting to like take me To like the shops and like go in like father daughter date type stuff because I've no seen him in a bit. Um Um, I'm getting I'm gonna take me to a petting zoo. I think Uh praying there's like actually animals there or it's just going to be like a goat in a field with like one of those like Put 50 cents in here and turn the style and feed the animal Can your stream addiction handle the it's going to be really weird Because like in the most respectful way like I'm just so used to like talking all day long to you reeflings So the thought of being like, oh no, I'm actually time gated Like I I don't experience time gated like yesterday. I thought I was only going to stream for four hours It turned out to be nine because yeah, like I'm not time gated. Um Spend time with your dad. Thank you. Yes. Thank you for understanding. Um I It's gonna be weird Like I need to pick out games that are short or games that can be done under eight hours because basically I want like if we do like four hours for the first stream then the other four to complete the game in the next one um Like it's gonna be weird You literally shoot him all the time. You think you're gonna accidentally talk to chat What like when I'm talking to my dad? No, I'm gonna like show my dad everything. I'm going like these are the reeflings These are all the like fan arts that have made of me. Maybe not the other stuff Uh, this is like me and these are the girls and the girls will say hi and all that jazz Let's call the jury campaigns. We're pretty short. Oh, maybe maybe Make sure you pay a sheebie and a fondle in person for us I didn't realize if someone gifts mercy member like if someone does membership gifts on mercy stream The audio queue is me screaming fondle opism I like mercy. Where did you even grab that from? So, yeah, if you ever wanted to know what happens if you gift a membership on mercy stream It's just me going fondle opism Like She yanked I had no idea she did that. I must have tickled her pink I didn't it tickled everyone pink. I didn't think the name was that bad. I thought it was funny Like oh, you're going to remember if a vtuber comes out and calls themselves fondle a bosom or you know, like If I can only stream for four hours and who's going to yap to the reeflings for the other five Literally, I'm like veal or girls girls besties. You're going to need to step up the reeflings are going to be uh needing A yap off Okay, you all start better start yapping about your special interests to put them asleep They the reeflings cannot go to sleep unless they've heard of either one a capitalist rant Two a rant about some random subject that Reminded me of something because someone mentioned something really obtuse Um or some sort of like video game relation thing. Okay, so girls get on it. Uh, I'm sure they'll do just fine um Yes, it's terrible, but it's absolutely hilarious. She's a memer too, you know listen first is a Family first, but you're my family reefling It feels it feels horrible being pulled apart like but Still four hours. I think is more than adequate Hopefully Hopefully I don't have reefing I'm coping on now. There are times I will see what my dad's wanting to because there'll be days where We don't go out and do anything. So I might be able to squeeze in a cheeky endurance here and there um But I'll probably have to Go and like talk to him or like five minute intervals at like every hour or something Just so he's just so I'm I'm still here dad. I'm still here. I'm just yapping away uh Him listening to the absolute ridiculous conversations we get up to he'll be like what's been sest What is bindo about you don't want to know dad? You don't want to know So I say that as if my dad isn't uh doesn't know about internet culture to be honest. So it doesn't really matter It doesn't matter in the end. Um We need every five minutes of your dad because we need to thank him. Oh, no He's like insert legal name here and legal address kind of uh parent So yeah, no not happening. Um, he might knock on door. He told me I was um What's that talking to him a wee bit ago? Um, and he was like I might bang on the door just so you know, I'm awake and I'm like great So I get to have a heart attack and freak out. Sure. Give him a patreon subs Meet that refund right there meet that refund right there. No um No, he didn't he doesn't he doesn't know those kind of no, then he knows that um, you know a voice slag Um and all that but no, uh, he no no, you know, you know, no none of that none of that Uh, no, not that kind of path. No, he's not a step dad. Um, put it that way. He's not step dad. He's he's mad at mad at Um, but yes, I need to think of like shorter games. I think stray is probably going to be on the roster Um You're wrong for that one chief. Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna be I'm gonna I'm gonna you're you kind of wrong for that one Um, like actual dad, but not a dad. I like I see Hope we get are you winning strongy? Oh, do you want him to do voice lines just for the hell of it? I was gonna see if I can do that halo playthrough with them, but I don't know if it's possible because Um It's take it. I don't know if I could set them up on it or not I might just do like the classic interview Thing like if you guys have any questions for my dad because I'm sure when I was going to be like What was it like that your daughter's a slag and then he goes well the house is paid off and I get to retire next year So feels pretty good. And then it's like, oh, everyone gets rolled in smoke that has ever said anything nasty Um make it a video. Yes. I thought about doing like an interview video where it's like because vtubers make it such a big deal My parents know I'm a vtuber Like Would they not know that you work at Tescos as well? Am I missing some key elemental factor? Do your parents like not just you know Do your parents not root for you and everything you do like are they not in your corner being like? Yeah, that's amazing. Go strongy go No Well, that's what I have anyway, so it's not it's never been like a Oh my god, my parents don't know what I'm doing. Please don't tell it. Well, of course my parents know what I'm doing I'm having a fucking carry on Do you think if you think I can't stop yam to you guys I'd be telling everything My parents know every little detail Well, I tell you a secret A strongy mama strongy like she be I Mama strongy is a harem and She really likes her voice and she finds her voice quite soothing And she's like oh, she has a really good voice really good voice. Yeah um She got on at me about emi's chest, so I don't talk to emi about I don't talk about emi to her Because she was like a strongy. I'm no sure about that and I'm like look mom Mom you have to understand Peytan is in Peytan stonks are in What does dad think about she be? I don't think dad really has much of an opinion. He doesn't really say much He like knows everyone's designs. I tell you what I'll get him to record his reaction to the designs I could probably do that in the interview type thing with him And be like because I've told them countless times. I'm called strongy He knows I'm called strongy And I know for a fact if I sit him down and record and be like name this feature bar he'll go um Oh And he can't come out of them strongy's mum's a hates flies. No, she doesn't hate that she's flat She dislikes the Young girl appearance Um of emi and she thought it was a bit messed up and I'm like like I can see it But I've been staring at icing emi for over a year now. It's just thing. I like it doesn't mean anything Like I tried to be like well, it's just the opposite of a cleavage really It's just a concave chest because she's got nothing there and mum was named She was kind of seeing it and she was kind of no seeing it and she was like right as long as yous are all safe and happy That's all she's as long as yous are all safe and happy. That's my mum The fact that it's a lollipop I aim my mum's Experience with like japanese and anime and that I forced her to watch kill the kill with me Which has a lot of fan service and she was like strongy. What is this fish and I'm like honestly It is actually quite embarrassing watching anime in front of your parents. So don't recommend that Oh Lollipop love everyone involved is an adult the end end of story. Yes, everyone is safe. Everyone is happy everyone Ah, yes, yeah kill kill son. I love kill kill There's a very good video game and kill kill I uh a fan game A fan game of kill kill And it is it is insane quality It's not a fighting game. No, um, we're a bit tied up in the game Is it by zone it might be because the quality was off the charts of the game Like honestly like something the development team for the anime made themselves. I was like good. Oh, I know that one I used to go absolutely nuts for that. I cannot have countless times. I have spilled my ink to it It is a fantastic game Um, it's outrageous. I know but I don't care Fun fact, bible black was my introduction. Have I seen that? I don't think I have My dad likes to watch anime with me sometimes the one he likes the most Was his high school at the dead. I wonder why oh, no, is it bad? Gaming bless your heart. I'm trying. I'm trying Oh, I know you mean gaming isn't it? Do you see yourself playing on elsewhere? Yeah. Um, there's this orc game that I'm absolutely tantalized by that I've never played it. I absolutely want to do like a Type of like live like we play it and do stuff together live type of stream um Uh, my only issue I wanted it to be free But someone raised the issue That having it accessible like that negates the audios and I'm like, oh, well I kind of agree Which is a bit shitty. I don't know what the solution is to that situation is I don't have a solution yet. I still have time july is kind of when it you know things start to break What do you mean by that? Um, so patreon's appeal is because you get very unique audios of scenarios um But I really don't want another subscription I Um, I don't want to charge anymore Because the fucking membership was one dollar more than I wanted it to be so I'm already raging at that And I don't have a solution yet. I don't have a How does it negate it? Because it's like here's free access to this content That arguably could be a lot better Um, because some people aren't into the audios for like the rp aspect And it's like well, you can you know It's uh, it's a bit tricky to navigate at this stage. I don't have a solution I don't have a finality either I Cheap vods via subscription Now vauding I might agree to a very small even if it's like a dollar I kid you not a dollar for vods. I think is agreeable For the actual live stream. I think all you would have to do is follow And that's it. I'm quite happy with that solution. That might be the solution A dollar for vod access I think is fair And then free access to the actual live if you can get it in time If it's all strong even that punishes people that have worked that punishes people in this time Rob Look at any other agency and be like, are you getting value for money compared to us? Yes or no Please I am trying. I'm trying to make everyone happy. It is not possible. Please work with me Work with me. These girls need to move out. These girls need to eat these girls need to find success these girls You know Fucking give them your money Be nice to the girls. They're trying to achieve stuff. Okay. I've already got everything I need with my wiflings. Okay You'll be to watch small fee votes is a pretty common setup. Okay There's no perfect solution, but that is one. Yes, there is no perfect solution In the wise words of captain I cannot remember his name of the star chick enterprise Captain Picard you can do everything right and still it goes wrong or something like that. I can't remember I don't see if it will affect patreon stuff. Okay. Well, hopefully it doesn't if it does then I Because um patron if you didn't know uh if you ever feel but oh, it's only five dollars And patreon statistically and very shortly should and will be the girl's biggest income source Um very quickly. So don't be afraid to support mom patreon Uh undercut in the market undercut the market five dollars for four audios undercut in the market as well as access and archive to anything They produce on youtube. Yeah Okay Undercut the market. Um, yes, it should actually be their biggest income source. Um, that's the plan anyway It looks like it's actually happening. You know that and I can only speak for myself at this point But Yeah, my harry on Are you kidding me right now hit by the pope. I wanted to stay up for your stream since it starts at 2 a.m Here, but I ended up heaping out of comfort of your voice. Thank you for rambling. Thank you flaws for the super chat Are you got floppy as your profile picture? That's floppy, isn't it? It is. Um Thank you for the super chat and uh, please rest well unless you're up already You tried to stay up for the stream but passed out Oh We've got a thousand wines bomb Flop a little big flop like who's gonna go. Hmm. Now that this free. I don't want to sell up on patreon hard You'd be surprised. Um Some of the patreon feedback is like that shit insane I could probably talk about it a bit more as time develops. I might even make a short out of it, honestly um, you would be surprised how People's like exit survey you can leave it if you leave someone's patreon. You can leave a message and it's like an exit survey You would be surprised on the reasons Why someone is like i'm no longer supporting you type thing My biggest problem is if I want to watch all the girls I don't have time to have to make sacrifices that I don't yet know if I am ready to make Oh, thank you our own reaper for the five and um Yeah the Yeah, it's kind of hard to keep up with all the girls at once. Uh, definitely not that easy. Um But what was I saying? I've completely forgotten. No My brain's too small to do multiple things at once. Can I give an example an example of what i'm so sorry I've completely forgotten what I was talking about um I Hearing the girls are really happy about how they are doing. Hopefully they can all make their situation better. Yeah, like I think Emmy's want to move out. Aces want to move out. Azura's want to move out. Shuby's want to move out. Everyone's want to move out Uh mercy wants to move out because Her parents make it a nightmare to record I'm not even I'm not even gonna pretend It should be like oh my parents are up. Sorry No, that's fine. That's fine. Just leave it. Leave it last minute. It's fine. It doesn't make a difference Oh crazy Patreon feedback. Uh, yeah stuff like uh no longer want to support because um You made this one audio that I don't enjoy and it's like Now don't get me wrong Please don't ever feel forced to like throw your money at Creators if you genuinely don't enjoy what they put out But some of the stuff is like you made one audio. I do not like out of so many audios that you have made I am gone and it was like, okay Why would you even leave that in the feedback like don't be realistic? I don't know if it like you need to be told to your face There's no way in heck one creator can make something that you enjoy a hundred percent of the time Like as soon as I come out saying that I didn't mind sounding. Oh, oh, strongy bad. Oh, right. That's it. Get it out right now I've got straw. Um I'm teasing I'm teasing Uh five minutes and 56 seconds into the audio you made a mouth sound. I did not like honestly it can be like that Um, I'll definitely show some examples strongy's a bad girl Who made you listen to that audio like come on. Yes, it definitely feels a bit like I Don't know if people feel forced to put something I don't know how it looks when you like disengage from someone's patreon subscription But I don't know if people feel forced to put an answer down You do not have to put an answer down and insult the creator on the way out just uh, just a quick tip for you You know, you don't have to insult the creator on the way out Even though like you literally put your money where your mouth was and supported the creator like is I will definitely make a short about it and show some examples because it's uh rather humorous It can be rather humorous Or when they make an assumption about everything you'll make in the future off of two posts Bruh, I felt so bad for she be I felt so bad for she be she was getting a bit of flak because the first audio just happened to be an s scenario And she made three d scenarios and one s and it was voted on the one s And she got so much flak and I'm like do I have to like come out and explain like how this works? like I am I am happy to say we do have a schedule that will be posted next month Where you can see what's coming up ahead So um, if you are on a monthly basis like you You sign up and then sign off again. You'll be able to see what's coming up I will try my best to put the tags, but I'm absolutely rubbish at making tags. I'm not used to it So it's hard to get used to it because I'm struggling me. I'm struggling. I'm not smart enough for this Okay, when this pops we're going to make a cup of tea and get some food in our belly because I'm getting a bit hungry Yeah, I think that would have changed the results. There is going to be that first plot d scenario I I just I didn't write it at the time because I at the point I had actually wrote 3d for her And then I was like, okay She needs one s at least and somehow you guys miraculously voted on the one s. I was literally the odds were what one in four But anyway, I thought it was really funny her first audio was sd I mean you do have to remember Am I allowed to say that? No, maybe no Maybe another time. Have you thought about posting demos? Um No, um, I actually no, I don't mean this in a bad way. Please do not think I'm 83 That's fantastic Um, please do not think I am honing in on your comment. Um, even though I am responding to your question though I do not believe In the need this sounds terrible and I hope it doesn't come across as bad as it sounds I don't think a preview is needed for such a low Undercut of the market as well as you can try it for for you can trial it for five dollars You can trial it. You don't have to keep it on afterwards um I do under like and the girls already post stuff for free on the alt twitter like I feel like you get enough of a Situation of is this going to be worth it or not? And if it's not worth it Hopefully that fight, you know, you're not going to spend five dollars that you actually need like so It's kind of like It's not even a lose There's like no loss as well because you've actually directly supported the girl like that you've helped them like Move out. You've helped them maybe upgrade their equipment that um, they didn't want to ask management for isura Per isura. She was too shy to ask for a new iphone. So I had to buy her one like right before debut um But she got it so our iphone's all juicy as far as i'm aware Is there a no yeah, it just seemed like there's a lot of extremes for the first people and I Actually can't make a comment I mean the first the first month is always chaos. Um People getting used to folk folk filtering themselves folk getting filtered like it's just the way it is Um, but like once things settle down, I mean I mean she I think I was in the the reef lines are all settled down Are we not like we're already jumping straight into endurance stream. We've got elden ring next week. Hello. No We've got elden ring in a couple of days like hello Um, I'm ordering take away on elden ring day. Yeah, you don't have to tell me twice. I assure you um I will absolutely like I feel like we're we're settled and you guys already know where the start score is with me Um, you know, you have to let the girls cook a little bit, you know, let them get comfy and all that jazz You're gonna catch she be stream. Oh she'd be live anything for any harem members. Sheepster's live mercy collab Uh, see you in the mercy collab. Yes, I will see you in the mercy club. Thank you for the tip. Bye Um, please do watch emmy is collabing with uh a person's name that I forget right now Unfortunately, and she be is live with inscription if you enjoy inscription. Yes, the elden ring dlc is coming out. Um I bloody hope I've done it on the right day I will download the dlc. We are starting a fresh save. Um, I don't know if it's one of those things where you can Just run to the dlc area. I mean, maybe if it's appropriate or unless it's like harder than kaolin type thing Can't wait to play elden ring. It's out today That I purposely push it a day back is elden ring tomorrow Eaps Oh, no, I don't want ashes Elden ring today Show me my youtube channel so I can look at my own Um So I can look at my own Schedule all children. Yeah, elden rings tomorrow. I'm heart rate monitor and all that. Yeah Elden ring dlc unlocks in like two hours. Yes, make sure you purchase Um, yeah, don't be surprised Um, when you see a ton of vtuber's playing elden ring, I think all of us are about to go fucking mental for it Man, it breaks my heart. Strone's providing so much literally and figure out the quality and quantity why sometimes even for free And some people are still asking for more Uh, it's human nature to want more. It's fine. I understand how it works. Like there's no point in being like, you know mad um Like you can only do so much and um, you know, you know, you're in yourself your limitations Like I wouldn't push myself to like have a silly goal of like one asmr video pair A 1000 subs type thing is the most dangerous of all the girls She sounds so sweet and innocent and then you look at her patreon And I feel like I should report myself to the police. What steady on I wrote her plots Uh, I will say they're they're my plots. I've been written for roughly two to three months Some of them are actually only two months Uh, and then the scriptmaster comes in and I think the scriptmaster will just work as far better than mine Um, so I think you'll like them a heck of a lot more Which reminds me I actually need to send off an editing batch away because me completed her july audio space Shawnee you're maoshi, but I do love all the girls and care about them I want all of yours to be happy. Yes. I want them to be happy too. It's um, it's very interesting some some um I you know I thought it was a pretty Honestly, it just feels like I've spawned in another five strongies and you know reeflings If that makes sense like, you know Mercy snippets Strongly reeflings like it feels like I've just spawned in another five that just do their own thing and have a good time And I mean that's what it's all about at the end of the day I don't think it's you know Fucking chasing numbers and oh my god Must must must have this must do this must do that and it's like no, I really have fun Like I get to reach out to other vtubers and be like hey, I'd love to do ASMR with you I'll write the script. It's like a fun little small goofy thing. You know no stress no fuss like it lets me You know interact with people in the vtuber community like it's it's like such a little blessing. Um I mean like our Holy shit. I get to claim that this is work. I get to claim that sitting in edgeville on world three eight right now uh doing wine Uh talking to reeflings is work in quotation marks like nah nah the same work Less like a corporal more of a guild of indies honestly, it's probably a more accurate thingy. Um Just that there was a lot of massive money back in to be honest. Um Yes, I'm going to try and get the girls at least 5k subscribers this Month, so I'm going to send Icy and Azura an ASMR. I'm going to get Azura to do heartbeat ASMR and kissing Maybe not kissing because I actually saw an ASMRist got their video removed for kissing I think Azura sleep aids heartbeat cuddle sound soft breathing would go very well She be actually has a sleep aid audio coming out. I ordered the artwork Um, and it's already here and I need to edit and get it ready to click send What do you mean? I'm doing far too much Work all at once. What are you talking about? No, not the kissing. Yeah, I don't know No, so you can do like soft breathing, but for some reason if you've got a 3d or you can't go up in the ear Make it make sense. Like I I've no got clue. Make it make sense. Thank you again iron reaper for the tip I'm pretty sure I didn't read your name out because we were all thinking about how evil emmy is But emmy's a good kind of evil Um, oh my tummy is rumbling I can't believe it. I may actually my human body needs to eat and hydrate Um, do you have a sleep aid audio coming out? Yes, I Haven't made it. I haven't written it But if there's anything you want in a sleep aid audio, let me know Um, I was probably just going to do the old classic route. Is there a cat in this room? Vigo I'm losing it I'm so dehydrated. I'm losing it and I think Vigo's in the room right now Uh, I might have to start making a lot of the sus ASMR member only Hmm I don't want to overwhelm the girls. Um with work requirements Um, like for me, you know streaming doing three member streaming weekend streaming every day is not problem But I am aware that people have limitations that I don't um And they experience things that I don't um So it makes it kind of like not a dangerous playing field But like I try to make things as super easy and simple like that ASMR. I got she be to talk to make sorry um I think it was like less than five minutes of dialogue and I know people might be like, oh my god Why aren't you giving us a massive amount of dialogue? And it was like I need to manage the girl's stress levels like needy streamer overload I cannot overload them with work whilst they're trying to stream I'm trying to entertain because they might struggle with things that I don't experience because I don't feel uncomfortable Or like I just feel literally right at home. Um But humble brag. No, I'm not even like in a mean way. I just like I need to be so careful and so cautious And like it's scary because like It's not like the girls have a hp bar and a stress bar that I can look at And be like, are you telling me the truth? Like I was checked in on emmy and emmy's like, I'm fine I'm cloud nine. I was like pinky promise me right now because I I don't know I actually don't know if you're good, but I think emmy is good and she was good and all that, you know Like if the girls had freaking hp bars and stress bars I would be a lot easier to navigate what I want them to do But like at the moment I'm having to be like patient and let them settle and like they've taken break days And maybe on break days they'll record the youtube ASMR's for me like It's um And who's thinking about you the reeflings are thinking about me silly The reeflings give me energy the reeflings give me life Hmm Literally I rolled out of bed 10 minutes before stream. I was moody. I made a cup of tea Um, I got set up the moment I come on live. I go in a massive round in rave. You guys fill me with with energy With determination. I've been filled with your determination Um Like yeah, you don't you don't you don't all worry about me. I get life like when you guys comment Oh, your ASMR was so cute. All the stream was so cute. I'm a vod watcher. Here's a clip like Uh fun facts Johnny. We love you. Love you to replay If they had hp bars emmy's would enjoy if hers was low munkos Uh, I would actually mess around with the idea of a feature management game I think that's very on topic, but uh, I don't have the development team I don't have a development team at all for video games, but I do have the funds But I would have to write out the game and I don't have time to write out the game right now I wrote out the bare bones of my cookie clicker game um Totally not inspired by legend of zelda by the way, uh Yeah, I do not have time to write video games Which is annoying because it's one of the projects I'm gonna do as that what the call the kids call it now She steals our energy. He's like, he's real emmy's hp bar has an inverse relationship. We're a happy bar Gen two game just saying oh, I already know what the gen two game is and the gen three game is I've already picked it out Um, I realized very quickly whilst I was commissioning the gen one game Oh wait games actually take a lot of money and time to produce. Um, so I already know what the The gen two is uh free to play video game of an alternative nature is um I'd be very surprised if anyone would guess it's because It's based on pre-established games, but we've We've borneified it and you basically can Swing with the girls in the generation in that game I Will go like She's 10 steps ahead of us when I say it took a year for the girls to pop up I wasn't kidding like you have to think ahead like you have to think of events You have to think of their birthdays. You have to think of their doughnut thongs. You have to think of alternative outfits You have to think Right, uh, we've made the offer if they sign on another year. They can get another alternative outfit All right, the girl's gonna want a group alternative outfit of a certain theme like There's like a possibility of a timeline that next year in june If we're all standing we might all have like goth variations of our designs something like that. Um Like there's a lot. Please not candy crush. No, it's not candy crush You're welcome Read and list bonus months. Yes, like we so the split is 80 20 and if they sign on another year that increases to um 85 15 um And they also get an alternative costume on the house by Like the development team But they can like dictate what all outfit they want. That's perfectly fine. We don't have an issue with that But we pay for it as I like thanks for signing on for another year. Yippee Will it be a card game? No, there's not a card game I actually can only remember the first two um The first two generations game type Based well, it'd be a mobile. No, it's a mobile. Are you joking me? Hi, I just got home from working realize I missed sharing a smart any chance It's currently on patreon at this moment in time. Um, I'm going to upload it to twitter I need to buy twitter Oh, we popped. Yay What are we? We're 83. Wait, we may actually make 85. My prediction is true. I can't believe that Wow, what's that? Yeah Cuttles turns into a sea jargon just like pokemon evolution cleolix and animal. Yeah. Yeah. That's a really good split. Yes, um because of the freedoms and how low is the As I've said this before the actual upkeep the up. Yeah. Yeah, the upkeep the upkeep really ain't that much Ain't that much at all? I don't know what to tell you. It does not cost that much. Um Probably the biggest cost right now is clippers unironically sending away these clip edits to be made um I have three clippers for the girls and they all unanimously Unanimously needed a break all roughly at the same time Um, which has led me to seek out a clipper for my own strongy stuff at the moment Uh, because I've completely abandoned like my youtube shorts Um in favor of the girls at the moment. Um, shebe's shorts are currently all getting limited So I can't promote her shorts. I can't put advertisement money into her shorts Um her praise short was supposed I was going to put money into for advertisement. I can't because she's got too much About 1.8k wines. Oh god. I don't know if I'm gonna make it in this room. Um But yeah, we we struggle Remember to rest by the way you have a collab too. Yes. No, I am I am I'm going offline when Uh, Azura comes on which gives me two hours rest, which is more than adequate. Um, I'm talking to mercy one hour before the stream starts um, and I just wanted to get some cheeky runescaping in because there's a few levels. We uh, definitely need to get up How do you work on their videos or what? Um, maybe like an edit and thumbnail um, so I basically um Go through their clips and if I find something clippable I will send it to an editor, but I've actually asked them to do that because I can't scour all their clips at once It's not possible. Um But I have pre-made shorts I make of them that's like insider knowledge about the vtuber agency or insider vtuber stuff Like mercy's shorts. Oh my god. I'm so sorry to expose mercy like this Mercy never wrote any of her shorts. That's all me The short about like senpai am I blonde did you look should I been blonde or like this is what goes wrong as a v These are that's me. I'm sorry. It's all me I'm telling her what to say Exposed called it. Yes. Um, but it's me. That's pulling the strings. It's me. That's wrote these scripts and It's me piloting her mecca and sending it off to the editor because I don't want to stress the talents out With like having to do all these bits and bobs in between streaming. It's not good for it to reduce their stress as much as possible I'm like Putting it on me because I can handle these stress levels. Like I don't even feel stress You know what I feel frustrated that I've let the girls down with a short scenario, but it's slowly evening out like what we're I think I'm probably gonna try and see if I can find another editor to have on standby because We've got someone that skill isn't quite there yet and I'm like I've need to pay the big bucks to get the edits. I want a new pair. You're such a hard-working beast Stroney is actually all a veeler Yeah, I wasn't kidding when I said I was icy snow paws Fuck I can't do our accent right now because I'm smiling I'm doing the most stereotypical accent Dada, do you like my photos on twitter at twitter.com slash ic snow Do you like my tummy data? I can't do it. I can't do it. It's terrible. If we ever do Like april fools. I have to go on ic because I can't do anyone else's voice Okay, real Michael. Hi Wow, yeah, like I can't do mersey's voice.

Je jouais Euh, lundskip Uh, yeah, sorry, that's me just absolutely losing it. I think I am gonna actually have to get some food and hydration Because I am starting to get a wee bit delirious We've got a tunnel vision is occurring my outside viewing point. Definitely not as good Uh, qu'on a mschit qu'on a mschit messes. Um Um You just got some snacks you really can't wait anymore like god damn it streamer get off Yes for any harem members that are lurking in the shadows, please be advised that none other than she be cotton boom is live right now Now you get yourself water and food correction. Yeah I'm so focused on the wines though. You'll make it. It's less than an hour if you lock in. Okay Right, we'll have a very quick break. I'm gonna make honey tea Um reefling if you could just uh start preparing for the ink for the tea. That'd be great. Um Yeah, ready? Okay Such an ASMR announcement Hmm reefling sometimes you have to force this woman to take care of herself. Remember that. Thank you for the great yap fest Gonna give she be some love. Yes, please do not be afraid to show any of my gen mates love. I have absolutely no Whatever the word is is a jealousy What is it? You know what we should actually create a name for the vtuber jealousy phenomenon I'm here for it. We should create a new term right now in the english language for when a vtuber is like Don't watch other vtuber's but like not because they're like yandere and like mercy doesn't count because she's yandere, you know what i'm saying But like we should actually call it and it's like it's the female vtuber phenomenon Where they get jealous envy tuba. Maybe envy. Mmm Envy cute possessive girlfriend Extranged tuba possessive. It's literally called a vendetta. Wait What's the definition of it? Vendetta The effort initiative all done. Let's pull up google for this one lads because I actually don't know it off the top of my head What a vendetta is Let me just brew some wine then you make me vendetta a blood feud in which the family of the murdered person seeks vengeance Or a prolonged bitter quarrel with with or campaign against someone. Okay. That one seems more like it A bit of a a bit of a bitterness. How about that a bit of bitterness? Yeah, it's probably a bit more Don't be self-centered Wrong definition. Isn't that called parasocial? I don't No, isn't parasocial when someone wants to show up to your house? I thought that's what parasocial the definition of parasocial is When someone genuinely wants to show up to your house. It's like Serion mate. Serion The convention sure show up to the convention my house. No, sorry. Uh, gimme. He's gonna start freaking out. No, that's the stalker Okay, no, that's talk. Wait, so then what's parasocial parasocial is getting attached online There's levels, but yeah, that would be better Yeah, I used to have people that said they were going to show up to my house. Uh, maybe don't do that Maybe don't do that Parasocial is projected one-sided friendship. Parasocial would be me saying strone's my best though when she doesn't even know my name And yet I can read your name in chat right now shopping behavior Is it is it like warped perception of reality? One-sided relationship with someone you've never met so you actually see yourself as someone's significant other. Ah, okay. Okay So It would be reality is not in check. I remember sweet Anita talking about her stalker situation I don't know Benny you guys heard about it It was like the guy literally bought a house across the road from her and would sleep in her garden in that and like peep through her litter box And like wake her up during the night and all that and she's just the police refuse to do anything and she's just like Oh wait, I don't know if there is an update. Maybe I'm making that up But she basically has accepted that the only way the guy's ever gonna be dealt with via the law Is she'll be murdered, which is actually quite a common case For stalking situations, I wouldn't be surprised if there might be new stalking laws coming out in the next few years because uh, yeah The parasocial knife cuts both ways because just just as we get attached to vtuber vtuber get attached to us Yes, I agree with that sentiment And like we said strong, he's my wife and I wasn't joking Ah, right But you know my husband Husband riefling husband riefling has husband sling husband Reef bend reef bend Don't be co-dependent to the corporal. Oh, no. Oh, if I guess it's out of the peeler allegations. I might allow it I just make the honey tea around here That's curious, it's curious It's like one of those forbidden topics you're not supposed to talk about but when you open when you openly talk about it It's like, okay. Okay. We're just getting perspectives in everyone's thought process. Well, it's almost like when you openly discuss things and Instead of just assume things behind closers like wild wild Husbandling husband, that's kind of cute And we're played runescape. So I have no idea what's going on. It seems like a just-chan. It is absolutely a just-chan We are basically doing the crazy crazy task of reducing Oh, it popped 84 Let's go. Okay. Maybe I should go for food now like actually go for food this time Um, yes. No runescape is just an opportunity for me to yap your ear off for hours on end I'm so sorry. You have fallen for my pranks yet again. You have fallen for my ruse. Um, I have misled you astray And to think that this is just a regular game. It's not. It's just another excuse for me to tell you about the capitalist I keep thinking that level sound is actually a jumpstart. Oh, I'm so sorry. How loud do you listen? Do you not listen on a low volume? Please make sure you're not listening too loud Um, because I will break your eardrums. Uh, when I get too excited. Do I make myself clear that husband briefly? Aw Thank you for the tip Zarian that husband literally me. Have I seen any that come literally me? No, I think our new version is that baby is literally me and I'm the father. I like that I'm enjoying that quite a lot right now. Um The husband and the baby is me. I like that hydration check right. Okay fine fine. I'm freaking I'll go get food I can't believe it. I can't believe my bodily functions need to take priority Man, why can't I just stream for hours on end?

I'm going for muffin Yeah, what's next on the roster of fucking eating? Maybe Maybe one more I need one k more wines and then I've reached my goal as Zoro comes on in three hours. I've got plenty of time What were we even sweating for? Burping is only when It's someone you're attracted to it's the same with the peeler stuff. Ah You know on the golden Uh, I think I might be pushing the upper limits of the AI at the moment So please do excuse me if I drop any conversation. All right, I'll do it um As I said, I literally do not have one piece of content that's limited ads because of um The upper I'm very aware of how the AI works. Um And you know how it can do like live transcriptions or whatever type thing Um, I am able to skirt them one because of my accent Which is fantastic because it cannot for the life of itself figure out my accent for a wee bit However, AI technology is adapting at a incredibly fast rate Which makes me nervous for when it does catch up with the old Scottish accent Um, which is why we're probably going to just become multi-cultural and just have like a billion different things Uh, Scottish accent doesn't count Hey, literally if you ever look at the closed captions on my streams Like especially when I go super scots like I'm mucking about with that accent or whatever It it doesn't have an it does not even comprehend one earth. I'm trying to say I don't understand it. Um, which I think helps me with all my Skirting of the the conversations we may or may not be having Mm-hmm Okay, I've had some water Yeah, in general it happens wherever AI fears the scots. Can you understand us? Scottish accent is an enigma to the human brain as well. So I think you're safer a bit until you all become scots with me so All right, I'm gonna finally open up this bag of raisins. So I commit to eating some of them because I've had them for how long Oh, jeez I can't oh, it's Oh, okay, we're in we're in Oh that smell rather My smell of smell smells delicious All right, let's who wants a chocolate covered raisin and please don't make fun of me for liking chocolate covered raisins I really like chocolate covered raisins.

They did you know manners are set and I'm just Burping makes you real you need to more spinach or whole grains and General also I found out during the mid-diet granola bars are terrible for nutrition Oh, are they? I freaking bought some for stream for when I do endurance days with I can't like I can't make foods That food literally Did you know AI so advanced I can make music now It was only a matter of time. Oh, there will be there will be a song made out of only my burps I actually so obviously in the day and age of AI technology Um, obviously it is a very hard field to navigate because of the implications of how many jobs it can take and how many livelihoods it um affects um And I am no exception. Um, you know If you want to be like mega serious the biggest example of like AI taking your jobs as v-tubers There's none other than uh neurosama And people like thousands of people watching AI to stream. Um, it's quite it's really magnificent if you look into it It really is um But like it obviously, you know artists, you know artists any like it I mean freaking hell me for example, like I didn't really want you to feed my voice And then I did consider possibly AI singing of my voice because I cannot sing um due to Um vocal damage. Uh, unfortunately, I've damaged my vocal cords successfully. Um in all my journeys that I I can't sing the way others can sing, you know Um, if you didn't know you can't actually train yourself to sing over time But I have like perma damaged myself and I've nerfed myself basically So I did think I did think like would AI song be Acceptable in that instance because I can't produce what the song is but I can feed An algorithm my voice to make that song and then it makes it sound like I'm singing type thing. Um Um But then I'm like No, because that's kind of like it's it's a very interesting like morals are coming into economies coming into it Everyone's got a wee piece and a wee side thing. Um, and it's very curious. I'm I'm interested to see where it's gonna go It's very nerve-wracking as a content creator. However, um, because um Content creation basically relies on People to fund it. Um type thing like obviously I'm a bit different because I'm already like self-funded if that makes sense. Um But like if people were to like just straight up stop supporting and being like well this AI posts it for free exactly what I'm looking for It's like these are real people But then you could start to argue like well that happens with any sort of medium like if there's a better competitor that comes up Well, yeah, they've lost out on their business and their pension and their business shuts down That's just the way it is in this market um So it's kind of hard to even get into a real Mitty bit of whatever the conversation might be when it comes to AI because there's so many nuances that can come up But these nuances are valid in the conversation topic. Um It's a double edged sword really it can help smaller game studios or indies produce games faster On the other hand it can put others out of business. Yes, the creative field it it's very Obviously we're kind of aware about the sinister nature of what AI has been up to recently with creating um fakes which is a shame because I don't think anyone should be subjected to that. Um You know, I'm I mean obviously as a creator I mean I have a bias and I'm like if no one wants that stuff out there Don't put it out there if they delete it then let it be deleted type thing Um, but that's just my two cents. Um, but I I'm aware that on the other side of a viewer being like this person provided me a lot of comfort these videos provided me a lot of comfort and Yeah, the world ends when AI can write software that actually functions at a high level without tweaking I'm about to tweak it Uh, I can burp in without holding my hand in front of me. I got hit too much on the back of my head when I was young from Oh, sorry. You got whacked as a child That's not good Did you know it actually throws your nervous system out if you get whacked as a child for correction reasons Content creation is enjoyed for the creator's personality or knowledge. So I doubt AI Well, see you say that but then my counter argument is Neurosama right now Thousands of people watching Algorithm essentially a machine learning algorithm um It's fascinating. It's really fascinating It is and obviously, you know, you can be like Oh, you're just to be here. You're mad because bought it bought doing better than you and it's like no I'm trying to I'm trying to explain the side of like This is a a machine That has been programmed Blade blade runner blade runner there there. That's how I'll connect the dots blade runner How about that? you know I think AI is an inevitable It needs It's very it's probably what I think is going to happen with AI is it's going to explode Everyone has access to it. Then laws and regulations catch up to the explosion, but the damage will already have been done I think That is what's going to happen my the reasoning. I think it is a blow up and then catch up but damage is done YouTube In the internet as a whole starting off as baby Everyone is catching up to what in real life laws there are because the internet and in real life are two different things I think we can all agree on that And a reflection of this is the current ongoing card Sorry, my throat was burping card payment processors They are actually catching up to almost in real life laws and things And it's not treating the internet differently. So one of the biggest examples right now is patreon is no longer allowing um artwork that depicts um Any possibility of cnc Even though the artworks are artworks and not real people But that's because mastercard is bending their arm behind their back because of in real life laws Like the internet is being caught up to in real life laws. Does that make sense? Hopefully that makes sense Doesn't the people watch uh dj and stuff like pranksters you use an ai to enhance your content wouldn't be that bad in the grand scheme of Yes, but I didn't what what what makes me hold back from aiing my voice to do song covers is One it loses its charm because it's not my croaky voice two It's it's not a statement of endorsement. No, however, I think it's definitely a like, uh, that's a shame she uses ai cncio content uh con con Is what cnc is someone someone type I can't type what it is what you Laws become uh antiquated fast even when they do come out. Yes, it's um very interesting to see how the Interwebs are being navigated at this moment in time. Oh, I lost it because I was reading we got 72 000 pop. That was fantastic um Yeah, it's a I like the deep diving in the convo is like this. I know like people like shout out shout away Oh, I don't want to get into it. I don't want to get into it. I want to get in a I want to see what your thoughts are I want to tell you what my current thoughts are you might change my mind. We might come to a different thing We may talk about this. I don't mind talking about these things I think it's nice. I think it's refreshing being able to talk about it. But I mean, that's for me Fake version of that. I am she's making winds with I don't I can't even translate that but yes, um l'ma the least ethical players are Are stealing their data. Yeah, I think a france um A french like art school got done for using AI and it was like the most ironic moronic thing and everyone was like, bro The AI conversation goes into politics easily. It's because the laws need to actually catch up, which I think maybe um, why? Probably leaks into that a lot But anyway, what do I know? I'm just Uh, a cuttlefish that wants to drown all of humanity to he what happens if it wasn't humanity Oh, sorry, someone wants to trade my apologies. Hold on. Let me make space. Hold on. Let me just connect these winds What's going on here? What's going on here? Right? What's going on here? Oh, you give me a what wait? Why is that worth 15k for that one wine? What is half full wine jug What wait, can I half drink? Why is that so much money? Am I going crazy? Wine of jug four Oh Half wine jug 18k Infinite moneymaker glitch Question mark. Can I like half drink these wines and make like a stupendous amount of money? Um Am I going crazy? Half wine. Why how do I get half a wine? Can you drink used drug used jug? Sorry No, dang it. Wait, how do you do half? What that's bizarre What is it? How do you get half you have 25 million? Why do you need look we're here to be billionaires so we can bribe the politicians to put in stuff that's actually against it for our interests It's a rare item that comes with events. How bizarre. Okay. It's the same reason burnt fish sells for something. Oh, I guess Well, it's main. No, thank you. Or do you want the wine back? You're allowed to have it back. By the way, you can just ask I'm not actually going to keep it. I'm just surprised. I didn't understand A brave politician. Oh as long as it interests their bank account And uh, you can pretty much pass whatever you want. As long as you got the the funds to cough up Which is why velour is going to be a billion dollar enterprise so we can change the world I'm just kidding. We are just anime girls on the internet. We're looking for some ink. Okay Yeah, it's called lobbying. Yeah And not the good kind of cod lobbies the bad kind of cod lobbies Back in my day wine used to be drunk in two gulps leaving behind the half wine after We're getting old We're getting oh, sorry. Just put that momentary again. We're getting og old scoop lore Geez, can I finish the sense right? I'll finish this cup of tea before I finish my next sense Vealers already changed me for sure Is it black croc? I've changed show but Strani's opinions do not represent veal or yes, I have to say that like unironically every stream Please do not be like Strani said this so I'm not supporting any of the girls. One. Don't be a fucking pussy Of course, I do not speak for all the girls. You absolute Um and two Why am I not let's go on an autistic rant by everyone else's there'll be rude Is it because I'm Scottish be honest On the original older version game the wing joke is upwards of 40 bell Literally let me go on my right What's these things I'm uneducated about and have a little opinion on what oh you shouldn't talk because Because oh you shouldn't have an opinion on things. You're not educated Uh, what do you think having a brain is about? Uh, what do you think about the learning is about? You know, you can present your information for me What you struggling with what concept do you struggle in with quick quick quick? What concept are you struggling with tell me and I'll talk about it later, bro Sorry, I'm arguing with people that aren't even they aren't even here. There aren't there's no one in this room right now There's no one seeing anything mean at all. I'm just arguing with potential Arguers. I'm absolutely losing it. I'm so sorry reef lens anyway Why ain't anyone I'm absolutely losing it me at the convention just straight up swinging on reef lens Oh, no, that's such an Unmeaned thought I don't like that idea on my head. She's arguing my ghost You want me to take your meds? Arguing with the voices She's arguing with the restless spirit of her toenail rip toenail It's um Not as bad as I I thought I I pushed I I would I would confess my sin I pushed through the bandage to see what I'd feel um I'm not gonna push it for a while because one that hurt uh ow and two Ow and three I don't I couldn't really tell what I feel. I think it just feels like touching a normal flesh really And But yeah, definitely not touching it again for a while because that's done I'm on basic painkillers now. Um, it's it's not It's really no that bad. It's really no that bad. Um Um It's probably just gonna be a patience thing now. Um, because it takes forever to heal Actually, I should go out in the garden and get some sunlight and me to help heal it off, but I want to play rinse And then I want to play goose game with mercy You can take your frustrations out on us Strenuous myths online that all visitors have a voice in their head. I can like argue with myself I'm not even being funny. I can just straight up start having arguments with myself about stuff Like that's why I like when I do actually go like off the rails on my wee rants a little bit It's because I'm in my head. I'm talking to someone that doesn't believe it And I have to explain it from the start like as if you were an alien and you've never heard about this before And I'm like and that's why I'm always like and another thing and another part of this like, yeah Your britain d levels are probably in the gut. No, the sun is too dangerous for me I need to go back to pale scotland Um, I'm actually in danger of the sun if you didn't know, um skin cancer in Australia is no joke. We We uh, hung Oh, wait, I don't think you're not let's say that terminology. My apologies. Don't don't mean to offend We pasty white ghosts are actually not really supposed to be on Australia because uh, we are not suited for the sun The sun's rays are extra strong Um And uh, yeah, isn't it winter there? It is but the sun is still very strong. It doesn't matter The uv rays just because it's cold it's still there. Oh my god. My freaking tea is cold Because I can't stop talking I don't think I've had a warm cup of tea in weeks Oh Ozzie and kiwi bro suffering from the sun Yeah Half Aussie half Scottish will you actually no no no full scots If you ever want to run a business and you can pick between scotland and Australia do it in Australia you get to keep more of your money And then go back to scotland. I mean I'm going back to Scotland I I my my pasty white people need me um, and we're having the refund farm in scotland anyway, so Yeah, it's uh Don't get me wrong Australia beautiful country. Love it. Love the sun. Love my chinese auntie Love my granny. I love all these people But I am not suited for this country. I am I am too used to the most oppressive ways of the uk. I really am Got a brew of tea forget about it microwave it then. Uh, do not ever suggest microwaving a tea in my presence You have to start are we raising shape? The farm needs eggs because we need protein um I don't want I think we just need eggs on the farm reflands and then we can have like I can make like scrambled egg pepper like from peppers and we grew in the garden And then that can be our wee breakfast and then lunch can be a wee sangha Would we have wheat production and flour? Would we have a flour mill on the farm? Thousands of chickens to feed us. I think we need like eight Hens lay us and and say I did my research on chickens I actually did my research while I was away on holiday wink wink um for a year. Uh So chickens lay eggs for One to five years and then they are considered an elderly chicken and no longer lay Most people just perish the chicken when it stops laying I couldn't do that if a chicken has given me eggs for five years and it stops I am not going to perish it because it can no longer do it. I want it to live It's happy little chicken life in the garden. Okay, like um, some people are brutal with their way Uh, their wings their chickens. I said, I guess the chickens are our wings roofland. Um But yeah, I they like can lay a lot There's also the possibility that we would need Ducks on the farm because ducks are natural pest control for slugs and stuff So for because I I want to go like natural I don't want to use like harsh chemicals or anything to like grow production wise like Um fertilizers all that stuff that's bad for the environment Um, but ducks and chicken are fantastic for getting bugs and stuff But the chicken could not be allowed near the crop harvest because chickens will destroy the crops However, ducks do not destroy the crops. Um, only chickens destroy absolutely everything They can pot their little beaks can get on because they are Destructors they also Stir up stir up the soil So if we need natural fertilizer, you can like just straight up scoop it and shove it on a plant bed Then it's pretty good Your chicken was eaten by weasels weasels Aren't weasels small aquatic animals that are like long like a noodle A weasel are weasels, but what? A weasel weasel A little small on aqua a weasel yoink your chicken isn't the chicken bigger than the Weasels are land based Oh looks like a little noodle That yoink to chicken That thing can take down a chicken. It's tiny Hold on. Let me pull up the picture. I'm looking at right now Uh, they look toy they look like a pet If I can pull up a picture anytime now, right hold on. Let's let's go be cheeky picture in Hmm This is what I see This yoink to chicken this that yoink to chicken It's tiny Unless they're like a lot bigger than I imagine Weasels are deadly shut up. These are deadly animals. Look at the freaking look a cutie looks I've been trolled humans can yoink ostriches. Oh, well you do actually have a point there hold on a minute Hold on that reefland speaking the truth. Hold on pause Okay They're cute till they open their mouths Is that like me a matty? Yeah Okay, maybe if it's like me a matty They look like ferrets. That's not a thought. Do you read the red wall series? There's a reason weasels are the villains in it No, I haven't read that actually. I don't know what it is I don't know what red wall is but that's okay Because I Means I can experience media that you guys enjoy. No, you're cute even after opening your mouth Hmm Rod red wall was game of thrones for kids. That is hilarious as a description um Is there a cat in here or am I losing it? No, it's the heating. Sorry the heating's come on and it's moving the blind And it makes me think that Vigo is on the window, but he's not And before a cat jumps up on the table and I get heart attack of a lifetime It's trying to you're cute when you open your dash straight You're not No, you're cute, especially when your mouth is open Good That's the way I like it But yes, uh, I will try my best to Actually properly update my youtube because now it looks all terribly wrong But it's going to be bulk troll for two hours spout roll. Sorry for two hours. And then it's going to be Um member stream for two hours and then that's a four hour day Which means I might actually have the energy to edit and do all the things I need to do um I liked moss flower a lot In moss flower there was an evil cat who had a bunch of mercenaries who taxed the forest animals and then Other folk went and killed them I should actually is robin hood This is going to sound so silly And if it is silly, it's okay. You can laugh is robin hood like um actually based on a novel that and not just that disney tv show um Because if so I'm here for robin hood not gonna lie He actually kind of he had a few good points, you know take from the rich that I'll never even notice that that's gone It is okay. Maybe we should read that Would you replace hypnotica? There's a cuttlefish in the game. Oh I might give it a cheeky shot. Um I don't know how hard should I play the game blind or should I look up gameplay So I am not completely clueless Because the reason I can play velcro on stream confidently is because I've seen someone play it play it blind Play it blind blind. It's fine. Okay. I'll trust you um I will stick it near the end of july for subnautica How about that deal? Near the end of july we'll do a subnautica. I'll do it blind and We'll see if my fish friends are going to be nice to me at all robin hood is not based on novel He's a legendary figure in folk folk lore The early stories about him dating back to 14th century were shared through oral traditions I'm gonna share some oral traditions with me Look I had to think about it on the spot. I couldn't change the sentence up that much I mean I kind of lose its potency, you know Oh, well, I will I try Hmm Well the character is in public domain is there a robin hood video game are you thinking that Robin Hood, but it's a girl the classic twist And then people get annoyed because it's gender changed But actually it just brings more publicity and yet again we have fallen for the bruce of the marketing campaign We can't escape it Fools I tell you fills we are Yeah, I'm sure you're skilled in oral traditions. Yeah, I want to find out I think I'm doing I can't remember what me fucking Audio supposed to be that comes out tomorrow I can't believe I'm actually gonna have to wake up an hour early for stream so I can edit that and get it all ready to Publish because I've not edited it yet because I'm a naughty naughty Are we talking about that and fire entire fate franchise fate Oh my gosh, we're in the 49,000s. We're no longer in the 50,000. Let's go Omri five. Let's go. Sorry. I timed out because I was reading Hey Congratulations, you just advanced the cooking level. You just advanced our cooking level your cooking level is 85. Let's Go. This was my goal for today's stream and we did it. I wanted 85 I'd be self plenty of time for Azor to come along You're now a quarter of the weight in a night. Don't see such heinous things in my presence I am Look, if there's any doubters, I'm gonna be honest. I'm doubting a little bit We'll see what happens by the end of the movie marathons and If the movie marathons are fine, we'll see where we are But you're making me nervous saying that I'm only one fourth of a way there I'm getting a bit shaky and not the good kind because I'm like bruh This is insane endurance I'm not sure like if If I finish this batch of 49,000, right? Surely that's my 99, right? That's 99 if I finish these wine. Yes, you'll be done. Okay Okay, I have faith because we started at 53,000 And we're already in 49 so I have a bit more faith now I'm getting my resolve tested roughly 48,000 needs to be done. Right. Okay. If it's 48,000 I can I can do it. Okay Give me one Endurance stream where we watch video games where we watch movies whilst we do this then I think we can do it I don't know. Maybe there'll be two back-to-back like movie streams Just so I don't have to think and I could be like, uh, grape goes in water jug Movie on the bunga basically um For meme ASMR just read the wiki page on the kingdoms of scotland Yes, I am going to do a movie watch along the next time we play runescape So I don't have to think basically and we'll see how much we clear in one of those streams And we can just enjoy the movies for what they're worth copyright laws. Oh, no, no, no, no, no You do not know how we do watch alongs in this house We have a timestamp and you're gonna see where we are, but we do not get copyrighted in this house. I assure you You'll just have to show up to the runescape stream to see what dastardly plans I have in order to do a watch along Hmm Blade runner or alien watch along strongly expected us to be mine Little didn't know it's gonna be me. That's mine broken by the end of this honestly. I thought 99 cooking was easy I'm sorry. I actually genuinely thought it was easy. I take it back. I take it all back. It's not easy. Oh, I hate this Well, I don't hate it I just I'm like Feeling a bit overwhelmed because I'm like, oh my god. This is actually going to I can't believe it I can't believe this achievement in runescape takes a while that barely any players have actually achieved It's a free 99. Is that why it takes so long? And before we could like swap to fletching and get it done when the day That would uh Actually be pretty hilarious. Just be like, all right. We'll do 99 fletch and write runescape series over when we got a 99 I'll take it. Cooking actually is one of the most common feels good, man See everyone just wants to know how go do agility 99. Absolutely not I don't know much about agility, but absolutely not. I know for a fact that's a nightmare one. I think Is it rune crafting is a nightmare one as well? I think thieving if I recall correctly Thieving is you pickpocket some guard from level 72 onwards. You just do the exact same thing for ages I cannot believe this is what prime runescape gameplay is. I'm so sorry, but it actually is as well Like it doesn't get better than this It doesn't get better than looking into your inventory pulling stuff out putting it back in again Mining is actually pretty bad. Hmm Is wood cutting the only one that you can like actually or is it sand crabs? Is it sand crabs you can afk like you're attacking damage on? But you still do need to be on standby or something. I can't remember I don't think there's any true afk like unless you count like hitting a tree afk um, I don't know You can afk the knight in combat easy. Oh Peak gaming, uh, I prefer pyramid plunder to arby knights, but each of their own ardy knights You can do alchemy I I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I think maybe once we hit 99 runescape. I'm definitely taking a big break from it I do genuinely thoroughly enjoy the game. I wouldn't mind doing questing again I actually thoroughly enjoyed doing the quest with everyone and I do not have much experience with the quest and plots so I wouldn't mind doing it like um At some point, but I'm talking like this is probably august if we're gonna if we're gonna runescape 99 this It's probably august until the next runescape content comes out because It's um, although the questing would be fun You gotta go members request. The real question is without help at what point should we be, you know If you didn't have help and did like if you And you did like barbarians like salmon maybe if you did salmon I Mean if he did it whilst I was like streaming other games You probably would be near the same level if not farther than me because I've just been grinding on other games baby I have grown so sleepy after eating all that food I'm like man. I could really use a nap before this collab. I don't I don't want to I don't want to I want to put make more progress towards my level But then again if we're doing like 12 or a shift to watch movies then It's not even a shift. Let's be honest What did you do for your work today? I did backbreaking work stacking shelves was doing the chill The tells had to like clean up like spillages and all that. What did you do? Oh, I watched movies while leveling up on old school runescape. Oh Like come on come on mate. Get real New runescape is like 10 times easier, but the levels are go up to 120. Do they not which is like four times 99 Unless I'm misunderstanding Well, you already reached your goal for today. Do you want us to tempt you to sleep? Don't because I think I might actually take a nap. I'm like, well if I need to be full strength for Mercy's collab. I'm like if I go how about if I take it to nine o'clock is she be gonna be on at nine or she be on now? Oh, I don't want to I don't want to um be a silly billy Naps kind of ruined my sleep she'd be live now I know she's like, but she's gonna be alive for like another 30 minutes if I round it up to nine a.m Which makes no sense for anyone not in my time zone if I round it up for another 25 minutes ish Um The modern version of the game you get a million xp an hour in the slayer skill and you can get like maybe 50 k an hour on here Oh, wow You are not messing around You can sleep am I ask she be Yeah, can um Can someone be very kind and bump into she be streaming just say Strongly wants to redirect to you in 20 minutes. Will you still be on question mark? Uh, I will appreciate it if you notice someone else has already typed that message Please don't spam or chat too much because I don't know. I don't know how in sync the reeflings are yet I mean you guys are actually pretty in sync. You think you think that yesterday, which means pretty entertaining Uh, yes I am very tempted for a nap. I've eaten all that food and I'm like I'm unironically barely full of mead and Like getting sleepy. This happened last time I played runescape. I think this is just such a like peaceful relaxing game It looks like she's just chatting. She's She said to late pee don't know Give her a pee don't So I can redirect into her in 20 minutes. She says probably till late. What's that mean? Yes, or no she be a young in 20 minutes Yes, I know Tell me she be right. I'll take that as a yes. I'll just make sure I redirect and then I'm going for a nap And where are you? Oh, Amy's playing with her palace at the level Hopefully she's having a good stream together with her. I need to learn her name out of respect I'm such a forgetful. Well, she hasn't even started the game yet. Oh, she's not even started. Oh, okay. That's hilarious Yeah, I'll it's safe to redirect into sheepsters. Um, right. We will do our 20 more minutes of wines and then I'm going to be a cheeky sod and go for a nap and uh Wake up. Maybe I can edit an ASMR in time. Um But my eye, I kid you not my eyes are like, um, yeah sleep sleep. I love sleep. That's a yappy dome It's very easy and at 90 if you do members trees, you can afk for like 20 minutes at a time Tastes like two weeks more though. Ah, okay It's afk though, it's good Oh, I need to pee pee because I actually put liquids in my body for once I can't believe it. I can't believe hydrating means that you have to pee. It's a terrible cycle Terrific one. Wow, this has been four hours. Yes. Sorry if you had anything important to do Hope I haven't distracted you too much Because I'll level in over here or just stand on a boot I assume the the reeflings that stand about like outside have already achieved these kind of things And they're just like them just happy to be here Because you could be level enough casually on the side, you never know You'll be eeping. Don't worry the collab vods will stay up. Um Mersey doesn't have a warning. She's actually been very good YouTube has not given mersey a warning so I have faith that the vod will not be taken down Um, and like I don't really see anything too outrageous My main account got wiped. I'm giving up on runescape. Oh, no How does an account get wiped if it got hacked they reset it but give you it all back? Like they reset the stats I don't even know how you'd wipe an account. I don't like your bank, I guess Hmm Brand new account because of you. No, I'm in it. You're in it too deep. Yeah, I got resets I mean, they should get your name back though, but that sucks That's all right, our say so cool. Hi, literally mersey the goodest girl. She's like the one I don't have to worry about ever getting banned She's just so good. I bet you she does come out with some stuff. I just have no clue because when she streams is I can catch icy in the morning if I wake up before streams, but recently I've been waking up Oh, I was up so late last night waiting for this Fuck and file to upload so I can send it to the editor to test her out and see if we're a good fit for each other I sent her a women joke. So I hope she doesn't get offended by it someone clipped me in the legend is Zelda stream And so someone was like, oh those Those rope jewels always freaked me out as a child because they just take your money or something And ask it in the way they read it The way they said it was like something along the lines of and then I went oh Isn't that just what women are or something like that? And I sent the joke. So if I get fired as a commission, I know what I know what a clip was the one too far Yeah, someone clipped it and I was like, oh, you know what turn that into a joke and I'll see what happens and To I explained like oh, this is what the enemy looks like in the video game. That was me Yeah, well, I can see your clips. I'm not kidding your clips helped out like I went through my clips and I had a few more to send over I sent an audio clip of a someone in the other stream was like, oh, you cannae you cannae clap Your cheeks basically and then like I stood up and instantly did it I've sent that to be edited in a clip So I don't know if this chick's going to be running for the hills when she realized what I've asked her to make for me Or if she's like going to be like solid and be like, oh, this is hilarious for me Because it's probably quite drastically different from like the regular stuff she gets commissioned for And I'm just like, oh, here's me. Here's an audio sound of my Basically as I I stand up like it's so silly. So either she'll be down or she won't but she's Aussie so I don't actually um Expect any issues because Aussies are pretty humorous Uh got pretty good humor not the clip of the being the boy you're cute I wouldn't edit it be like that's cheeky And it probably goes through so many emotions when receiving the videos. Yeah Uh Aussie internet is terrible. I uploaded and So, you know youtube shorts. So take mercy shorts, for example I have to send off what is known as an mov file, which is A full transparent file off to the editor the problem with mov files. They are absolutely Humongous for no reason and no need now. I know you might say why don't you use green screen? Look at the color of my hair in my outfit. Why don't I use green screen? Don't ever talk to me again. It's such useless and I'm just gonna um So it's just easier to send mov files like emmy for example You say, huh emmy emmy can use a green screen actually emmy can't she has a green jewel on her necklace Can't use green screen. Anyway, so I it was like 7 p.m. I was getting 8 p.m. I'm waiting for this file to upload I'm like please upload so I can send this per chicken audio of me clapping without my hands I was getting Exhausted and I was like I'm gonna have me fucking sleep and me energy for runescape and then obviously as soon as I came online I'm like, hi guys like I have all the energy in the world. I kid you know, I leech energy from refunds. It's true because seriously Billy more, you know blue screen exists too. What's blue screen? What if I tell you that you can't clap will you give us another demonstration? No I have to only do once Cheeky Um, I sent away five like pre-made edit shorts type things and then I sent away like seven Stream clips that I thought were mildly humorous two of them might not be able to be turned into a clip due to the nature of them just like some moments are funny on stream, but they cannot be translated into a youtube short because there's not enough context There's not enough time and you're limited to less than 59 seconds Basically less than a minute. Sorry blue screen is like green screen, but blue. Oh Sorry, I understand what you're saying. Yes. No, I don't know what you mean, but like it's just MOV files are just to go to the the easiest to Thingy, but anyway, I got it sent off is the long and short of it. Um, and I got pretty poor sleep unfortunately Oh Cuz I didn't get my my full eight hours. Oh, no. I didn't get ever sleep. I'm a little by me And as much as I'd like for you to visit with Jeremy don't come here the internet quality and price are horrible. Oh My dad went to Berlin and he absolutely loved it. And he was wanting to go back to Berlin I might be doing a Europe tour with my dad on ironic clue. Um Um It depends what happens next year. Um, my dad might officially be retiring depending on if You know if I do you're done basically paying for his retirement long story short Um, but I was wanting to celebrate it if he does retire and I was like Do you want to go on a european tour? Because my dad likes traveling around europe like he really likes the multiculturalism of all even though He cannot speak speak a lick of any Um He cannot speak a lick of any of the languages nor does he bother. He's like the oh He my dad is polite as anything He's like, oh, hello And then he'll point to the menu with a smile on his face and doesn't say anything else and I was like, oh, okay okay, dad um But uh, he wants to go back to germany. So I might actually be in germany at one point to be crazy Congrats on whoever loved it. I also came back after I love you and break just to watch the call fish I'm dragging yous back into the runescape home Probs are proud dad. Yeah, he wants to go to berlin because he loved it. I absolutely loved it I can't remember what mom and dad did in berlin though. No before anyone makes any jokes I don't want to know what my parents get up to when they're alone in a foreign city. I do not want to know Um I think they did like the classic tourism stuff in berlin. I don't know If they went anywhere Because I think my mom's pal came along as well. I'm just trying to remember But my mom and my mom's pal went off to go visit some of the a monuments like, um Outfits and that just to like get all the Cause like you can go see like all this the stuff and that Um, I think my dad was just alone in the city and he went away for some food and that and the thingy And just like laughing at the thought of my dad being alone being like, I love you guys God and yeah A bit of ironing like uh, uh the thought of my dad trying to speak german of Why berlin is the ugliest city? Well, let's say it's where the tourists go and I mean there's all is it's very easily accessible It's very, uh, English-ified as well for tourists and you have to understand tourists like familiarity So if there's a place that's like, oh, there's got English things about they're gonna be want to go there, you know Uh, oh god Spotted in europe Well, there is the possibility of like going to italy because I want to go and see Roma and I want to go see Uh venice all because of assassins creed. Yes. I said it Yes, I want to go to roma and assassin's creed and uh venice for assassin's creed No, I don't care if that makes me some weeb gamer. I don't give a shit. I want to see it. I want to see it um Going to hamburger to eat the first hamburger I don't know if the girls are trying to convince me to come to america. Like I'll do it for them Because azura was like I can't I was at azure sheebie one of them was like, oh, I'll take you out to like either I'll take you out or I'll make you like a decent. I think azure is actually like a decent cook I can't remember. I might be a zura. I might just be making that up and I'm going to get sprang most likely the last option um Germans also don't like speaking german. Yeah, if you go to germany visit It's basically a disney castello. Oh my feature revealer. You are an anime girl on the internet. You are the weeb. Ah I always say I'm a gamer over a weeb and Like azura her freaking anime knowledge is like limitless. Holy crap. I'm like, uh, I just play expo 360 games to be honest And I'm stuck on the nostalgia of them because I like familiarity Uh, although saying that and each of her means I get to like try games for the new time Like I will not stop talking about it buckshot relay and needy streamer overload These kind of games that are actually smaller in length are so um Appeasing to the streamer profile if you will It's why I'm interested in producing games that are roughly no more than four hours in length like wrap it up Wrap it up. I don't I don't want to be playing the same game for like ages I think it is very uh Obtainable to streamers kind of this four hour thingy, which is why I came up with a cookie clicker game That's actually completable. Um, if you didn't know they're Uh, the the the og cookie clicker game. Um, it's not completable Um within four hours unless, you know, wall hacks are on are you doing 360 noscopes through the map? um Which is why I concepted a game for the first time in my life like that um Obviously making via lures games kind of giving me a bit of an insight of what happens, but the reality is I've been very hands off I just explained what I wanted and what I needed Um and paid for it. Um, I ordered the artwork and stuff. I got some I got an artist that was comfortable with all body types um mersey actually previewed her scene artwork If you want to check out mersey's alt, um It's currently getting animated right now and then I need to cut up everyone's voices And then the game's pretty much ready to ship. Um Wait, I don't know how long this animator is going to take. I do not know the animator They were outsourced by the developer for me because I didn't have anyone that did this kind of thing Um, but it's been a fantastic learning experience behind the scenes of being like I want this I want that I will do this you do that and then we just you know and came together with the games there. Um Our save file is a thing in this game And the VLR game no you don't need a Oh, there is actually You get rewarded if you replay the game I I specifically wanted a 20 minute experience. I think it's maybe each round Like finish it. I think it takes like 30 minutes to go over like the to finalize the Situation I want to be vague on purpose because I don't want to spoil it Um, but the more you replay it the more you can unlock Something and not scenes you have access to all of the scenes right off the bat If you through your first playthrough But for people who enjoyed it or just want to see you know what the other stuff is There is a small amount of replayability. Um, and it was a bit important to have a bit of replayability because Um, yeah, no one I mean 30 minutes and then you're done. I mean Yeah Can you save in the game? I assume so Uh, the game is free to play but I think you can save your progress So if you are looking forward to a certain Scene or animation with one of your favorite girly pops from velour then uh, yes, I believe you can access that right away um Resident evil you think I play It do you know it cost millions to develop these kind of games you think I had millions in my back pocket No, it's a free to access game. I've got cute little artwork to go with it Girls are voice acted at the cost through this much like okay. Can you save in game? I don't know Was there a hoon for it? I don't know I really need a pee but I'm about to end stream Ah, I can't believe it the peeler allegations. Oh, I can't do it. I actually really need a tinkle now that I know All right. I've got eight minutes. I can hold on Oh my god, it's not pee. It's a two. Oh, it's both. It's both at the same time. I'm not gonna make it So you're super excited millions of gp You don't have millions. How are you gonna buy the castello? Um, I'm gonna work for it I will I'm gonna work hard for it. I need to pay my ASMR debts I need to pay my ASMR collab debts because there's three girls still waiting on my dang edit and I do apologize But I did record my lines, which is the best part Pixely rpgs games remind me of Wow pixel games. Oh, that's so cool. What pixel? Oh pixel Pixel oh, that's amazing Hint hint cough cough nudge nudge For the gameplay. Anyway, not the actual art. Um Working on things in this economy No, I say we steal a castello Well, we just steal castello santian. We can live in italy surely are the lines fairtile in italy Shawnee take the mic where you go. No, not yet. As I said, azura has to pass the baton to me if azura doesn't pass the baton I can I am confirming or denying the aligank the aligankies the aligankies um of peeler Uh Working on things in this. I know I need to work hard. She works hard for the money and I need to do azura and ac script next That's probably one of my top priorities because I want everyone to be 5k by the end of this month um And at least 5k I'll see what happens if I can get some editors to do some clips of the girls and fart some money into them But me me editors they're gone All of them are like one of them's like i'm sick other ones like uh, I've got in real life stuff Other ones let my pc just fucking explode and i'm like, okay. Thanks. Um We're getting hints. I feel so special and sorry for all the rooflings out here I always give like a little peeper preview or something in between streams It's just as a a special thank you for like listening in because I know I'm not everyone's cup of tea type thing. Um But uh, thank you for tolerating me. Here's some insider knowledge that you everyone gets to know about in about a month's time You know, I can't I can't stop yapping and releasing all my projects. Okay. I just get so excited Man, I'm a lot of excitement for my project They're all lying. They're all gonna play elton ring. I'm calling it now Wait, who's playing elton ring the girls? Or did I misunderstand? I mean I misunderstood your message That's a very high probability. Thank you for tolerating me A month it's so close. Yeah, the the game The game production started in february all the everything's there We're just waiting on the animation sequence because there's an animation scene when you Uh, complete the objective Um, I think I almost just spoiled the game there. You know that. Um Yes, when you Do the mission objective? Yep, that's fine to say. Uh, you unlock a scene with a girl And you take it from there You take it from there you do that now you play one handed Um, I'll be very surprised Uh, yeah, it's unfortunate how many editors are in disposed as scottles lunches Yeah As a game dev myself, is it cool if I attempt to you can absolutely make a fan game. No problems at all. Um I honestly don't I don't I don't know why all these fucking companies have so many rules as long as it's not like derogatory Or you're saying shite about the girls like It's all good. All your editors are playing elden ring right now. Oh probably I'll actually have like three guys have a new guy on board. Um And just like It takes a while, but I'll see how I go with my Me me me Aussie editor my girl editor. Actually, I wouldn't mind talking about her on stream if she's comfortable with it That sounds really weird though. Hey, can I talk about you on stream? The way you edit my clips So, okay. All right, you freak give me a moment. Just pay me the money. I'll shut up Oh No, it's Johnny spoil in the ending. What tries you to someone no, it's not even the ending. There's like there's rounds There's rounds and you got pick you gotta pick the girl and there's rounds and if you succeed in your mission objective You get to Um, there's also it's not really hidden dialogue But you can pick the girls in a different order and you'll hear a different line depending on what order you pick them in but it's not like a Oh, there's like super hidden Crazy lore. It's like no you you won't hear that sentence unless you pick that girl in that sequence It's that kind of thing. You don't actually miss out on anything and then Um for the ending scene unfortunately the ending scene didn't go the way I wanted it to fucked up Um But it's all good in the hood. I actually think it's quite adorable. I think you guys will like it rounds like pokemon Rounds no, no not like strategy turn base. It's a freak. Yes, boys. Go It's trying to break in NDAs motherfucker. I am the NDA No, I don't even There was a contract signed with the game developer unfortunately because of how much money was passing through the hands Um, but I mean it's all I mean everything I've seen what I've seen all looks good to me. Um I think mersey's name is actually wrong in the video game right now and I need to tell them It's not karam I I told you that mersey's name got changed very late in development. It's very possible right now. She's called karam in the game I need to check in with the game dev actually I've just been running out of time everywhere like everywhere I have ran out of time And I'm like it'll settle soon and it will settle soon. I just need to get to the stage where it settles soon I'm just not there yet. Like once um Especially when my dad comes and sees me Um, because I'll be doing those like four hour streams. I have to admit It's probably gonna be a lot easier to like keep on top of everything um But like my plans have an expiration like you know, like aw strongy aren't you stretching yourself too thin doing the 1,000 uh Celebration videos every 1000 one ace more video every 1000 Yeah, but it ends at a certain point and growth is an infinite like it'll slow down like it's definitely it'll slow down There's no doubt about it. I like oh, but what about the um ace more clubs? You're doing what other v-tubers again? It's gonna slow down. It's not infinite growth like it's it's I have a goal of doing 100 v-tubers I can do it all in one month if I really wanted to um or I can take my time and do it over the span of many months Like everything everything slows down It's just obviously debut happened And then everything exploded and now everything's going to slowly come back like once the video game goes up Like my next project is getting on a game show for the girls And then the next project uh Azura's got her lovely donut song coming up next project like it's not It's not like an absolute hammer in like as I said We're getting clippers in place now because it was hard to get clippers in place before the girls were producing content because that's not possible Um reeflings we aim for a million no no do not aim for a million I'll be happy with a play button As as myself as strony cuttles and then after that i'm like right we're done I mean I'll still keep going but I'm not doing like any more celebratory type stuff You spread scrawny scrawny propaganda on tiktok and instagram Oh Right, okay. It's time I need to go for a pp Um, I I'm at three million cooking xp. Can you see that you can cooking xp three million? Yeah That's fantastic Okay, I am going to redirect into our lovely jubilee um She be cotton boom. She is playing a game called Encrypted or something inscripted or something like that Um And it's a card game, but it's a bit creepy and thingy So make sure you got your blanket on if you get a little scared reefling.
