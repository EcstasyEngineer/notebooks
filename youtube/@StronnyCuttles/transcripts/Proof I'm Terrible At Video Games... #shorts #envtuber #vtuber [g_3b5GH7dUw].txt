Alright, what do we actually need?
Trap the shopkeeper in the garage!
Wait, she's going in the garage now.
How do I trap her in?
Oh, we pull it down.
We pull it down.
Oh no, I was...
Oh no!
Help me lady, I'm stuck in your gate!
I'm in the garage mate!
Have I just softlocked us?
No, I don't think so.
The objective, get her stuck in it.
Me instantly get stuck in it.
Wait, until she gets inside.
Hello, come in.
Wait, unless I steal an item and run in with it.
Chase me into the garage.
