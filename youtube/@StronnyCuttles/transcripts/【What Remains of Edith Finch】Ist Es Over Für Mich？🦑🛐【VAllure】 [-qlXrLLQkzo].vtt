00:00.000 --> 00:01.040
Oh!

00:04.540 --> 00:10.540
I need to wait for it to go up, but I need to test if when I click live it instantly, like you can hear me?

00:10.540 --> 00:13.700
Or if the thing is having a natural...

00:15.280 --> 00:16.340
Oh...

00:18.200 --> 00:20.200
I'm smelling away right now.

00:21.460 --> 00:22.500
Good morning!

00:22.500 --> 00:24.340
Good evening!

00:24.340 --> 00:28.500
Good afternoon, you little fucks. That wouldn't let me win a Mario Kart.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.900
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen!

00:33.900 --> 00:35.900

00:35.900 --> 00:36.900
How are ya?

00:38.400 --> 00:39.100
How are you?

00:41.900 --> 00:42.600
Hi, mommie.

00:42.600 --> 00:43.200
Mommie?

00:43.200 --> 00:43.700
Huh?

00:43.700 --> 00:44.300
Mommie?

00:44.300 --> 00:44.900
Hi, strongy.

00:44.900 --> 00:45.300
Cha.

00:45.300 --> 00:45.700
Mommie?

00:45.700 --> 00:46.300
Hi, mommie.

00:46.300 --> 00:46.900
Hello.

00:46.900 --> 00:47.500
Hi, strongy.

00:47.500 --> 00:48.800
I missed you, strongy.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.100
Missed you too, Riefling.

00:50.100 --> 00:50.500
Hey, wait.

00:50.500 --> 00:51.300
Time to cry.

00:51.300 --> 00:52.300
I probably hope not.

00:52.300 --> 00:53.200
Hi, mommie.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.100
Hi, Riefling.

00:54.100 --> 00:54.700
I'm fine.

00:54.700 --> 00:55.400
How are you doing?

00:55.400 --> 00:55.800
I'm good.

00:55.800 --> 00:56.500
Love, Riefling.

00:56.500 --> 00:57.200
I hope you're doing good.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.200
I'm glad you're doing fine.

00:58.200 --> 00:58.700
Hi, mommie.

00:58.700 --> 00:59.300
Hi, Riefling.

01:00.300 --> 01:03.800
Well, I pleaded I was drunk at a friend's house and not there.

01:04.800 --> 01:05.300
Hi, mommie.

01:05.300 --> 01:05.800
Hi, Riefling.

01:05.800 --> 01:06.800
Hey, strongy.

01:06.800 --> 01:07.800
Hi, Riefling.

01:07.800 --> 01:08.300
Hi, mommie.

01:08.300 --> 01:08.800
Hi, Riefling.

01:08.800 --> 01:09.300
Hello, mommie.

01:09.300 --> 01:10.300
Hello, Riefling.

01:10.300 --> 01:11.800
Hello, Riefling.

01:11.800 --> 01:12.300
Hello, mommie.

01:12.300 --> 01:13.300
Hi, Riefling.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.800
Yeah, this is over for you.

01:16.800 --> 01:17.300
Hi, girls.

01:17.300 --> 01:19.800
Hi, Riefling.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.800
Hey, mommie and Riefling.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.300
Hi, Riefling.

01:23.300 --> 01:23.800
Hi, mommie.

01:23.800 --> 01:24.300
Hi, Riefling.

01:24.300 --> 01:24.800
Strongy.

01:24.800 --> 01:25.800
Riefling.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.800
I missed you and I haven't been able to watch you live.

01:27.800 --> 01:28.800
It's been so depressing.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.300
Aw, don't worry about it.

01:30.300 --> 01:31.300
We're your busy bee.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.300
Hello, strongy.

01:33.300 --> 01:34.300
Hi, Riefling.

01:34.300 --> 01:35.300
Hello, mommie.

01:35.300 --> 01:35.800
Hi, mommie.

01:35.800 --> 01:36.800
Hi, Riefling.

01:36.800 --> 01:37.300
Hi.

01:37.300 --> 01:38.300
Hi.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.300
Strongy, love.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.800
Riefling love.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.300
Thanks for the seratonin.

01:42.300 --> 01:43.300
You're welcome for the seratonin.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.300
Hello, mommie.

01:44.300 --> 01:45.300
Hello, Riefling.

01:45.300 --> 01:45.800
Hello.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.300
Hello.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.300
Are you squidding me right now?

01:47.300 --> 01:48.300
I've got my daily counter.

01:48.300 --> 01:49.300
I am burning rage.

01:49.300 --> 01:51.300
Gonna try writing this in your accent.

01:51.300 --> 01:56.300
Hopefully, Brian, I'm nor being funny when I say I love your voice so much.

01:56.300 --> 02:02.800
Whether ageing, sleepily mumbling, yapping, or sensually whispering are just wanna hear

02:02.800 --> 02:05.800
it all the time, nay exceptions.

02:05.800 --> 02:09.800
Wait, that Brian actually kinda spoke a bit of Scots there.

02:09.800 --> 02:14.800
Now, oh no, no men there, Brian.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.800
You got a bit twang to your accent there.

02:17.800 --> 02:18.800
Thank you, Brian.

02:18.800 --> 02:19.800
Kindly.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.800
Thank you, tiny spiny for the tip.

02:21.800 --> 02:22.800
Hi, strongy.

02:22.800 --> 02:23.800
Hi, Riefling.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.800
Thanks for babysitting me while she's being gone.

02:25.800 --> 02:26.800
Hi, harem.

02:26.800 --> 02:27.800
Hi, harem.

02:27.800 --> 02:28.800
I'm in a car.

02:28.800 --> 02:29.800
Hi, y'all.

02:29.800 --> 02:30.800
Hi, harem.

02:30.800 --> 02:31.800
Shebe's coming back soon.

02:31.800 --> 02:32.800
Don't worry.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.800
And then she's gonna milk you.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.800
Did you get some sleep, mommie?

02:38.800 --> 02:41.800
I got drumroll, please.

02:41.800 --> 02:49.800
Seven hours, and I had a dream, and I've already forgotten the dream, but I do have an update.

02:49.800 --> 02:56.800
I did the dad, I did my dad name's VTubers, and you're not ready, okay?

02:56.800 --> 02:59.800
You're not ready for the stuff my dad came out with.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.800
Oh my god, I did not expect it.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.800
Is YouTube messing with your title or is it German?

03:05.800 --> 03:09.800
No, it is a German meme where a guy goes, is it over for me?

03:09.800 --> 03:14.800
But because of the way it looks in German, it's quite readable in English, so the sentence

03:14.800 --> 03:18.800
is over for me, because apparently I'm gonna cry a lot in this game, so yeah.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.800
Not the fully hours, but something, yes.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.800
I did it with my dad.

03:25.800 --> 03:29.800
Do you want to know what my dad's first comment about Azura's model was?

03:29.800 --> 03:32.800
Because obviously I got him to react to my gen mates.

03:32.800 --> 03:38.800
Just as a bit of a spoiler, my dad called Azura two fried eggs.

03:38.800 --> 03:47.800
Now, we all know what he's referring to, because she has gold shielded plates on her front, right?

03:48.800 --> 03:51.800
So he went, he went, her name's two fried eggs.

03:51.800 --> 04:00.800
I was like, I did not fucking conceptualize Fondle of fucking Bism for two fried eggs.

04:00.800 --> 04:05.800
I think I can't, off the top of my head, he called my model.

04:05.800 --> 04:12.800
He obviously didn't recognize me, even though I've shown my, like I'm sure we've sat and watched me stream together.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.800
And like we watched the Microsoft stuff and all that.

04:15.800 --> 04:22.800
And he called me like a pink, pink knickers knee pants, and I was like, alright.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.800
And then, and I was like, alright.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.800
And she's also named after her dad's gamer tag anyway, Shonium.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.800
And I'm like, yeah, I'll take it, Shonium, Shonium, yep.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.800
I think, and then Mercy was the second one.

04:35.800 --> 04:40.800
And he was like, he was like, Mercy, Mercy, Mercy.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.800
Well, he never said Mercy, because he doesn't know anyone's name.

04:44.800 --> 04:50.800
And he was like, oh my God, she's not got any knickers as well.

04:50.800 --> 04:51.800
What's going on here?

04:51.800 --> 04:56.800
And I was like, uh, I was like, no one's got a scar, no one's got knickers.

04:56.800 --> 04:57.800
But you know what?

04:57.800 --> 04:59.800
I was surprised about it.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.800
He called Amy cute.

05:01.800 --> 05:05.800
I was like, are you, are you fucking, are you nailed her design?

05:05.800 --> 05:08.800
She's the most adored, knee knickers, literally knee knickers McGee.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.800
And he went, oh, Amy's really cute.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.800
And I went, damn straight, Amy's cute.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.800
So, dad's a cunny Vtuber confirmed.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.800
That's my little sister, yeah.

05:24.800 --> 05:25.800
So cute.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.800
And she's funny too.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.800
It literally sounds like you're saying the M bomb.

05:30.800 --> 05:31.800
Oh shit.

05:31.800 --> 05:38.800
In Britain to say, uh, uh, under where we say that word.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.800
And it probably sounds a bit funny in my accent.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.800
I promise I ain't saying none of them.

05:45.800 --> 05:46.800
That shit.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.800
We don't tolerate that shit for around these partners.

05:50.800 --> 05:54.800
Uh, is this a, is this a controller game?

05:54.800 --> 05:55.800
What is this?

05:55.800 --> 05:56.800
Right.

05:56.800 --> 05:57.800
Right.

05:57.800 --> 05:58.800
Before we get into the game.

05:58.800 --> 05:59.800
Boom.

05:59.800 --> 06:00.800
Tell me what you think.

06:00.800 --> 06:01.800
Let me know.

06:01.800 --> 06:02.800
Right.

06:02.800 --> 06:03.800
No.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.800
Are you squidding me right now?

06:05.800 --> 06:06.800
Anonymous.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.800
Anonymous says papa cuttles is becoming an Oni-chan.

06:10.800 --> 06:11.800
Honestly.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.800
He absolutely nailed AC.

06:14.800 --> 06:15.800
Oh my God.

06:15.800 --> 06:16.800
He went, she looks cold.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.800
And I was like, yes.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.800
And then he went, she looks like ace.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.800
And I was like, yeah.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.800
Like I was going, I was flipped.

06:24.800 --> 06:25.800
I was doing backflips.

06:25.800 --> 06:29.800
Cause there's no way that my dad would actually physically, you know, come up with the actual

06:29.800 --> 06:30.800
names of the characters.

06:30.800 --> 06:31.800
It's not possible.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.800
But I got him to react to some other people as well.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.800
I got him to react to project melody.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.800
And oh my God.

06:39.800 --> 06:43.800
So I showed them their reference sheets that has their names on them.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.800
But my dad didn't know that that was their name.

06:45.800 --> 06:46.800
So they didn't count.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.800
And on her reference sheet, it said 69.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.800
And he went, he went futuristic 69 girls.

06:52.800 --> 06:53.800
For project melody.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.800
And I was like, oh my God.

06:55.800 --> 06:56.800
Yes.

06:56.800 --> 06:57.800
Like, oh my God.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.800
He like, we looked at Poseidon.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.800
So if he didn't know Poseidon from Mythos just got a new model.

07:03.800 --> 07:04.800
And I showed that off.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.800
And I was a bit of a twat.

07:06.800 --> 07:07.800
I actually said her name.

07:07.800 --> 07:11.800
I was like, oh, she's based after the mythological God Poseidon.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.800
And then he went, oh, X rated Poseidon.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.800
And I was like, yeah, yeah.

07:16.800 --> 07:17.800
I'll take that.

07:17.800 --> 07:18.800
I'll let her name slip.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.800
But I literally futuristic 69.

07:21.800 --> 07:26.800
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to get mock logos for whatever he said.

07:26.800 --> 07:31.800
The girls finalized names are like, miss me from being you.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.800
Oh, sorry.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.800
Anonymous.

07:34.800 --> 07:35.800
Thank you for the tip.

07:35.800 --> 07:36.800
Hi, strong.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.800
Have you been keeping up with work since you passed out?

07:39.800 --> 07:42.800
Um, not quite.

07:42.800 --> 07:43.800
But so right.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.800
Let's go over the.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.800
Let's go over the schedule.

07:48.800 --> 07:49.800
Okay.

07:49.800 --> 07:54.800
So again, there's three short streams, a little to the left, two hours, roller coaster, tycoon,

07:54.800 --> 07:57.800
two hours, little kitty, big city, two hours.

07:57.800 --> 07:58.800
And then hold on a minute.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.800
What's going on on the 25th?

08:00.800 --> 08:02.800
ASMR is back.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.800
Memberships are back.

08:04.800 --> 08:07.800
ASMR streams back on the 26th.

08:07.800 --> 08:12.800
Then we've got a watch along of a mysterious video.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.800
I'm going to say it as a friend.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.800
We are going to watch a friend that is debuting.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.800
And I said to do it for free.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.800
So we're going to support a friend.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.800
And if you like her, please.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.800
You're more than welcome to give her a cheeky subscribe.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.800
Don't be surprised.

08:29.800 --> 08:34.800
I might, I might see an exchange for me watching you live on stream, my friend.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.800
You have to do ASMR with me.

08:36.800 --> 08:38.800
No, ifs ands or buts.

08:38.800 --> 08:39.800
Okay.

08:39.800 --> 08:41.800
When is the debut?

08:41.800 --> 08:44.800
On the 26th at 10 p.m.

08:44.800 --> 08:45.800
E.D.T.

08:45.800 --> 08:46.800
Nope.

08:46.800 --> 08:47.800
That's life of Brian Watchlong.

08:47.800 --> 08:48.800
Sorry.

08:48.800 --> 08:49.800
Try again.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.800
On the 26th of Friday at 8 p.m.

08:51.800 --> 08:52.800
E.D.T.

08:52.800 --> 08:53.800
Mystery Watchlong.

08:53.800 --> 08:54.800
And you don't get to know who it is.

08:54.800 --> 08:55.800
No.

08:55.800 --> 08:56.800
No, you don't.

08:56.800 --> 08:57.800
Why do you?

08:57.800 --> 08:59.800
And then next is who wants to be a millionaire.

08:59.800 --> 09:00.800
But hey ho.

09:00.800 --> 09:01.800
What's up?

09:01.800 --> 09:02.800
What's up?

09:02.800 --> 09:03.800
What's up?

09:03.800 --> 09:04.800
What's up?

09:04.800 --> 09:05.800
Who wants to be a millionaire?

09:05.800 --> 09:06.800
But hey ho.

09:06.800 --> 09:07.800
What?

09:07.800 --> 09:08.800
Wait, wait, wait.

09:08.800 --> 09:09.800
What's the catch?

09:09.800 --> 09:13.800
You get to see my heart rate monitor and I'm wearing my shock collar.

09:13.800 --> 09:19.800
So every time I lose a round on who wants to be a millionaire, I get to shock myself.

09:19.800 --> 09:20.800
Okay.

09:20.800 --> 09:26.800
And then that gets followed into a member's ASMR where you see my heart rate and I shock

09:26.800 --> 09:30.800
myself in the ASMR member's room as well.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.800
And then old school RuneScape 99 Cooking.

09:33.800 --> 09:39.800
Potentially we might be able to do it in one big 12 hour robot, okay?

09:39.800 --> 09:41.800
Is it a little tight around the thigh area?

09:41.800 --> 09:46.800
What do you mean you don't like my big fat lips?

09:46.800 --> 09:48.800
Oh, the perfect.

09:48.800 --> 09:52.800
We might be able to finish 99 Cooking, okay?

09:52.800 --> 09:58.800
I am going to watch my gen mates in the background because I don't have time to watch them live.

09:58.800 --> 10:03.800
So I'm going to pick two hour streams from each girl.

10:03.800 --> 10:08.800
I'm going to do a little marshmallow thingy and that is our endurance beginning.

10:08.800 --> 10:09.800
It is.

10:09.800 --> 10:12.800
And what happens when we hit 99 Cooking?

10:12.800 --> 10:14.800
We'll probably do some...

10:14.800 --> 10:19.800
We'll give it a little break and then we'll come back and we'll actually just do some

10:19.800 --> 10:24.800
questing because I've never actually properly done questing.

10:24.800 --> 10:29.800
I did it with you guys for the first time properly and I want to do it again.

10:29.800 --> 10:33.800
It was so fun questing and making sure like, come on, you know what it feels like?

10:33.800 --> 10:37.800
It feels like I'm a teacher on a school trip with like a high vis vest on and like, come

10:37.800 --> 10:38.800
on everyone.

10:38.800 --> 10:39.800
No one gets left behind.

10:39.800 --> 10:40.800
Make sure you've got your buddy.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.800
Come together right next step.

10:43.800 --> 10:44.800
I really enjoyed that.

10:44.800 --> 10:48.800
So I'd like to do that again for the multiplayer game.

10:48.800 --> 10:53.800
That is what's going to be considered the multiplayer game this week.

10:53.800 --> 10:57.800
But yes, I'll have a bit of an update tomorrow.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.800
About a few things behind the scenes.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.800
We do love a few updates behind the scenes.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.800
A few spoilers of the agency.

11:03.800 --> 11:06.800
What do you mean agencies should hold freaking secrets?

11:06.800 --> 11:08.800
I can't believe it.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.800
You'll never get me.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.800
You'll never take me alive.

11:13.800 --> 11:14.800
Okay.

11:14.800 --> 11:15.800
Right.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.800
One thumbnail to show you.

11:18.800 --> 11:23.800
Just one.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.800
This is one thumbnail.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.800
Spoilers from scrawny.

11:27.800 --> 11:28.800
No way.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.800
We're all open here.

11:31.800 --> 11:35.800
When we get in her quick, her quest.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.800
You know the answer to this one.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.800
Are you sure?

11:39.800 --> 11:43.800
What was as original and I've got phone a friend.

11:43.800 --> 11:44.800
Let me see.

11:44.800 --> 11:45.800
She be M.A. Marisa.

11:45.800 --> 11:49.800
I could phone a friend for this question.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.800
What was as original name?

11:51.800 --> 11:54.800
Whole lot cleavage.

11:54.800 --> 11:59.800
Grab them by the daddy.

11:59.800 --> 12:00.800
We'll find out.

12:00.800 --> 12:01.800
I love the news so much.

12:01.800 --> 12:05.800
Answer Z.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.800
I thought you guys would get a little giggle over that thumbnail.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.800
Let me slurp my tea.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.800
Has everything been going good?

12:12.800 --> 12:16.800
I was quiet on the eastern front from my POV.

12:16.800 --> 12:22.800
You guys haven't blown anything up while I've been away.

12:22.800 --> 12:26.800
Someone says favorite game series you played on steam.

12:26.800 --> 12:34.800
And are there any games you want to play but can't?

12:34.800 --> 12:38.800
Any games I want to play but can't?

12:38.800 --> 12:40.800
If you mean like from lack of skill?

12:40.800 --> 12:41.800
Yes.

12:41.800 --> 12:46.800
There's an insane amount of games that I want to stealing sea from my future YouTube career.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.800
Do not call that.

12:48.800 --> 12:49.800
That's terrible.

12:49.800 --> 12:50.800
Fondalovism.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.800
I'm such a good fucking name.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.800
Everyone's rippin' into me for it.

12:54.800 --> 12:59.800
Someone sent me a nexus mod for Skyrim but I'm too scared to open it.

12:59.800 --> 13:00.800
Hey strongy.

13:00.800 --> 13:01.800
I perceive this.

13:01.800 --> 13:04.800
I hope that I don't have to explain why I'm showing this mod to you.

13:04.800 --> 13:05.800
You want me to mod my Skyrim?

13:05.800 --> 13:06.800
How dare you.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.800
You don't want me to play vanilla Skyrim?

13:09.800 --> 13:10.800
Okay.

13:10.800 --> 13:11.800
Hi strongy.

13:11.800 --> 13:12.800
Hi rippling.

13:12.800 --> 13:16.800
Wanted to let you know your streams give me something to look forward to every day.

13:16.800 --> 13:21.800
I feel like there's no amount of support that I can give that would adequately reflect a happy.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.800
You do not have to give me anything.

13:24.800 --> 13:28.800
Streaming isn't an exchange of goods and services okay.

13:28.800 --> 13:34.800
I get to play my goofy games and then you get to be tormented by my goofy games.

13:34.800 --> 13:38.800
And then everything is awesome.

13:38.800 --> 13:43.800
We really are on the best timeline to have you look back after all that's happened.

13:43.800 --> 13:44.800
I love you unironically.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.800
I love you unironically too.

13:46.800 --> 13:49.800
I'm glad you can enjoy what I put out.

13:49.800 --> 13:57.800
I know I know I'm a bit special but my mummy caused me special too so it's fine.

13:57.800 --> 14:01.800
Can't wait for the fangfully degenerate Skyrim theme.

14:01.800 --> 14:05.800
I've been pondering the best way to say this so it's not too stupid.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.800
This is the best I got.

14:07.800 --> 14:12.800
I am not doing that short after the feedback I got.

14:12.800 --> 14:13.800
So please don't worry.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.800
I'm not going to do the short.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.800
I didn't explain myself very well but long and short of it was basically.

14:18.800 --> 14:19.800
Get tipped.

14:19.800 --> 14:20.800
Get tipped.

14:20.800 --> 14:21.800
Get tipped.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.800
Thank you Spidey.

14:23.800 --> 14:24.800
Not tiny Spidey.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.800
You took infusion me.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.800
What do you need to kiss because you both have the same name.

14:29.800 --> 14:30.800
Well hold on a minute.

14:30.800 --> 14:31.800
We ain't pin pals out here.

14:31.800 --> 14:32.800
Hold on a minute.

14:32.800 --> 14:33.800
Hold on a minute.

14:33.800 --> 14:34.800
Thank you Spidey for the tip.

14:34.800 --> 14:35.800
I appreciate it.

14:35.800 --> 14:36.800
What a short.

14:36.800 --> 14:37.800
Okay.

14:37.800 --> 14:41.800
I will explain it in a bit more detail because my thoughts weren't very straightforward.

14:41.800 --> 14:42.800
Okay.

14:42.800 --> 14:43.800
Now here's the facts.

14:43.800 --> 14:52.800
The Vealour announcement trailer has 100k thousand views on the Vealour YouTube channel.

14:52.800 --> 14:53.800
Okay.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.800
Now originally it was trending.

14:55.800 --> 14:56.800
It was doing quite well.

14:56.800 --> 15:00.800
I put some advertisement money into it but then we didn't actually need to have that much.

15:00.800 --> 15:10.800
We had to, we could cancel them because a VTuber news covered us and then the video went trending

15:10.800 --> 15:12.800
up to 100k views.

15:12.800 --> 15:19.800
I was going to discuss a short about why the VTuber you watch might go absolute apeshit

15:19.800 --> 15:24.800
if they make it on the VTuber news and it's because there's a correlation between new

15:24.800 --> 15:27.800
eyes on you, new subscribers, new views, etc.

15:27.800 --> 15:28.800
Okay.

15:28.800 --> 15:35.800
I didn't explain it very well because my worry is that the channel you know is ran by a guy

15:35.800 --> 15:41.800
and we follow idol culture but the focus wasn't about the guy.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.800
The focus was like this is insider knowledge.

15:43.800 --> 15:47.800
Like I was going to show you the graph from we got mentioned on this date and then you

15:47.800 --> 15:50.800
see the graph and it just jumps right up type thing.

15:50.800 --> 15:51.800
You know.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.800
I've got nothing to have.

15:53.800 --> 15:56.800
Oh I thought you were talking about making a short.

15:56.800 --> 15:59.800
Yeah so that was what the short was about right?

15:59.800 --> 16:05.800
And then I said please use Marshmallow for anonymous feedback because I know that not everyone,

16:05.800 --> 16:09.800
you know you can't all reflect the shumer in one go type thing okay.

16:09.800 --> 16:14.800
Hold on let me, let me slurp my teeth it's getting cold hold on.

16:14.800 --> 16:19.800
But I've decided against doing it because I don't want to upset anyone and I know some

16:19.800 --> 16:23.800
of you might be like oh that's perfectly fine because the focus isn't on that.

16:23.800 --> 16:27.800
I don't want to alienate or upset anyone so I'm not going to.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.800
So please don't worry okay.

16:30.800 --> 16:34.800
Less than 20 minutes in and don't regret staying up for strong eight.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.800
Oh that's so kind of you.

16:36.800 --> 16:40.800
I'm gradually, me who's literally just rambling about Q&A stuff.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.800
I'm not even freaking played the game.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.800
I'm not even started.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.800
Yeah.

16:46.800 --> 16:51.800
Someone says I have an unexplainable desire to hear your voice through a phone mic maybe

16:51.800 --> 16:53.800
a Twitter space or something.

16:53.800 --> 16:54.800
Is that weird?

16:54.800 --> 16:58.800
Maybe there's just something endearing about unprofessional quality.

16:58.800 --> 17:02.800
I'm going to put an iPhone headphone up my butt.

17:02.800 --> 17:08.800
Does that count for your unprofessional quality in the audio?

17:08.800 --> 17:10.800
I mean it may.

17:10.800 --> 17:14.800
It may.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.800
Wait I thought you guys were seriously about wanting that.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.800
I was going to do it.

17:19.800 --> 17:23.800
I mean what did she say?

17:23.800 --> 17:26.800
Can't get more unprofessional than that.

17:26.800 --> 17:30.800
Turns into an iPhone mic.

17:30.800 --> 17:35.800
Hold on let me slow it with you.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.800
That 360 mic that you could use.

17:37.800 --> 17:38.800
Do it for science.

17:38.800 --> 17:39.800
I'm with the science team.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.800
You mean an AirPod?

17:41.800 --> 17:47.800
No like it would be on the strings because I don't want to get lost up there you know.

17:47.800 --> 17:48.800
Are you squidding me right now?

17:48.800 --> 17:50.800
I would like talk to you while sitting inside you.

17:50.800 --> 17:54.800
To be fair you could just ramble and I'd still love the stream.

17:54.800 --> 17:58.800
I'm not like a Zatsun streamer.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.800
I need like a mission objective.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.800
Thank you Broly Legends for the super chat.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.800
I need like a mission objective or else I can't do that.

18:06.800 --> 18:12.800
When I was playing the Watamelin game this week or however you say it.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.800
Why is the title German?

18:15.800 --> 18:17.800
Hello, what's up?

18:17.800 --> 18:20.800
Or did you not know I am German VTuber?

18:20.800 --> 18:23.800
I love the schnitzel.

18:23.800 --> 18:29.800
I like game spelling.

18:29.800 --> 18:30.800
What's that?

18:30.800 --> 18:33.800
You're just saying Dutch in front of German words.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.800
I'm substituent.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.800
Oh my god yes.

18:37.800 --> 18:40.800
How did you not know that with my accent I am German?

18:40.800 --> 18:43.800
Sorry I have fooled you.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.800
I play prank on you.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.800
Not Scottish at all.

18:47.800 --> 18:49.800
You have been pranked.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.800
That's right in your face.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.800
You've lost your job.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.800
Oh my god.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.800
Oh my god.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.800
Okay.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.800
Have a confession.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.800
When you were making strange sounds and teasing me right now.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.800
I was joking.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.800
Okay well I'm not going to read that one out loud.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.800
Sorry.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.800
Broly legend.

19:13.800 --> 19:15.800
Thank you for the super chat.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.800
Mission objective survived as that.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.800
I didn't know where that was going.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.800
I didn't know where that was going.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.800
I apologize as soon as I said that.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.800
I'm sorry.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.800
I always find VTubers in an accent so pleasant.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.800
I listen to ASMR side.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.800
The streams make me so sleepy.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.800
Oh no.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.800
Oh wait.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.800
What's my harsh accent?

19:37.800 --> 19:39.800
Oh no you're falling asleep aren't you?

19:39.800 --> 19:41.800
Go to sleep.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.800
Go to sleep.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.800
My weedy friend.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.800
Go to sleep.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.800
Go to sleep.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.800
Go to sleep.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.800
Go to sleep.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.800
Oh!

19:57.800 --> 19:59.800

28:13.400 --> 28:17.640
one odd game i didn't know what to expect i thought this was going to be like one of them pixel

28:17.640 --> 28:25.560

28:54.760 --> 28:58.200
i thought it was gonna there's this sad game that the truth is

28:59.480 --> 29:06.520
even after i inherited the house i never thought i'd come back to it so everyone's dead in my lineage

29:07.400 --> 29:10.920
but now i had questions about my family but only the house know the answers to

29:13.800 --> 29:20.840
curious the house was exactly like i remembered it the way i'd been dreaming about it

29:23.480 --> 29:27.480

29:28.120 --> 29:37.000

29:51.800 --> 29:55.000
i was afraid of the house what

30:00.600 --> 30:03.960
i hope the key might unlock the front door it didn't

30:08.360 --> 30:11.800
looking in i felt like the house itself had been waiting for me

30:13.400 --> 30:17.000
what's that movie where the house was alive monster house

30:17.960 --> 30:21.080

in years i felt like i was home all refunds imagine if we had a lovely picture but instead of a

31:08.360 --> 31:18.840
family there were just memories of one that's a lot of fish wait um and it spins as well it's

31:18.840 --> 31:25.000
like a captain's reel and oh look at the hob this is big money hob this big might be money

the table was still a wreck from the night we left

32:50.200 --> 32:56.360
the night you live my mom was the only one of us who could imagine it was like a bomb had gone off

32:56.360 --> 33:00.120
killing everyone but sparing the furniture what

33:00.840 --> 33:01.560
it's

33:04.440 --> 33:08.360

34:05.560 --> 34:07.960
well like the corpse was just being chilling or

34:08.360 --> 34:15.160

34:24.760 --> 34:31.560
the dates are how long they survived greggory was one calvin was a living what

34:31.800 --> 34:33.800

34:45.400 --> 34:48.360
we still have a key but we need a room to go inside of

34:50.120 --> 34:55.400
whenever people ask me about my family the first thing they always want to know about is barbara

34:55.400 --> 34:58.840

45:20.840 --> 45:23.560
here

45:33.400 --> 45:37.720
this passenger i was still hungry and across the water

45:37.720 --> 45:42.760
he swam to me and it's something i had to have so i swam towards it

45:45.320 --> 45:48.680
i'm not gonna lie i don't really see where the parm's supposed to start crying out

45:48.680 --> 45:52.600
i slithered onto the sand and the good smell went into an old pipe

45:57.640 --> 46:00.120
pov me after the reef ones have ran a train

46:01.880 --> 46:07.080
that's not funny don't laugh at that that was a terrible joke terrible tent to humor and stop

46:07.080 --> 46:11.400
i was literally toilet humor but i'm right i'm in a bathroom

46:12.120 --> 46:14.120
okay

46:16.280 --> 46:22.440
i got closer and closer oh she's gonna eat herself well metaphorically her body

46:22.440 --> 46:29.400
ate itself i guess is the i literally cannot see her i assume she's on the bed

46:31.160 --> 46:39.320
all my stomach all my stomach started growling her body ate itself i assume it's what

46:42.120 --> 46:46.120
i held my breath for a long time but i couldn't hear anything

46:47.080 --> 46:52.200
i think it's waiting for me to fall asleep but it's not going to wait much longer

46:52.200 --> 47:05.320
found it needs to be and we both know i will be delicious

47:12.360 --> 47:23.320
i'm not sure if i believed all of that but i'm sure edie would have

47:24.280 --> 47:29.240
uh

47:34.520 --> 47:39.480
how bizarre this would be obvious later but my mom never told me any of these stories

47:41.000 --> 47:43.560
edie would have but mom didn't like bringing up the past

47:45.240 --> 47:49.960
though when we adopted a stray kitten uh-huh she was the one who named it molly

47:50.760 --> 48:01.000
but okay let's go in the window i spent a lot of time in great grandma edie's room

48:04.680 --> 48:05.960
her room was like a museum

48:10.360 --> 48:15.800
for 500 years the finches have been famous throughout norway for their over norwegian and

48:15.800 --> 48:16.520
misfortune

48:19.880 --> 48:25.880
odin finch buries the latest victims of the family curse his wife inga borg and their newborn son

48:26.440 --> 48:26.920
yohan

48:29.720 --> 48:37.480
on january 7th 1937 he set sail with his family and his house hoping to leave the curse behind

48:39.560 --> 48:45.160
but 40 foot waves off the coast of washington send the house and odin to the bottom of the sea

48:46.520 --> 48:53.160
um odin's daughter edie with husband spin and baby molly step ashore on their new home

48:53.800 --> 48:54.680
orcas island

48:56.520 --> 48:59.880
odin finch is the first to be buried in the new family cemetery

49:03.160 --> 49:05.720
his daughter edie is already dreaming of a new finch house

49:06.360 --> 49:14.040
um i'm not sure what on air oh sorry i meant to like

49:59.880 --> 50:07.080
i just keep press s how did you know that reefland oh my god literally saved me what the

50:07.080 --> 50:14.760
fuck whatever's wrong with this family it goes back a long ways okay that you actually saved us

50:15.240 --> 50:19.320
you unironically saved us thank you reefling can i unlock from this side

50:20.520 --> 50:28.440
no i can't curious right we've got an oxygen supply we've got our monday meds Tuesday meds

50:29.320 --> 50:36.920
remember to take your med lewis died a week before we left but edie had already started to memorialize him

50:37.800 --> 50:38.600
oh

50:40.120 --> 50:46.120
what does he call edie knit me a new pair of gloves every year just in time to replace the old ones

50:46.120 --> 50:47.640
that's why she's got gloves on

50:52.600 --> 50:59.000
all f4's ultimate cure to the games one summer they evacuated the island but edie refused to go no

50:59.000 --> 51:05.880
because then you'll this is what that's she was a celebrity i'm will edie won't go 72 year old

51:05.880 --> 51:14.120
woman refuses to vacate because of a little boy a little forest bar never heard anyone built 1937

51:15.080 --> 51:21.960
ovin fiends yaw ovin he told people spen was killed by a dragon she could also have said he

51:21.960 --> 51:26.600
was building a dragon shaped slide that collapsed she could have but she didn't

51:27.960 --> 51:36.520
no i'll wait to go out dragon kills bench tragedy strike so it's a no way even in your 90s

51:37.080 --> 51:43.960
sometimes edie seemed a lot younger than my mother and my mother oh is that carpet

51:43.960 --> 51:49.960
oh carpet in the bathroom

51:54.200 --> 51:58.920
oh poor thing she couldn't sit in the bathroom the only trace grandpa sam's first wife k left on

51:58.920 --> 52:00.760
the house was the pink bathroom

52:01.640 --> 52:06.600
no it was a pretty big trace

52:09.080 --> 52:11.320
oh wait the key unlocks everything

52:15.880 --> 52:20.040
imagine having books walked around the house and no having an inclination there might be something

52:20.040 --> 52:28.120
there the real good open i'm there's a secret in this bathroom uh-huh it's in the last place you

52:28.120 --> 52:39.080
would look it isn't in the cupboard it's hidden in this book okay how curious i'm still not sure

52:39.080 --> 52:44.680
what to make of this game have the majority of you played this is this like one of those games

52:44.680 --> 52:48.680
gave sam an old camera he'd refurbished he never put it down

52:50.520 --> 52:54.040
he developed photos red light

52:57.480 --> 53:00.520
no i'm not doing exactly what you think i'm doing

53:06.200 --> 53:08.520
never seen it no only watched a video on it

53:09.240 --> 53:14.360
explore the universe

53:18.680 --> 53:22.280
it's just a story we feel visuals don't you agree is there anything over here that's

53:22.280 --> 53:25.160
supposed to do is this like i do not cross does he pop his bogs

53:30.440 --> 53:34.440
oh i was gonna jump down on it but i guess not uh right there's something i knew grandpa sam had a twin

53:34.520 --> 53:39.800
and that he never talked about him so the command center

53:41.880 --> 53:44.760
i guess my grandpa didn't like history anymore than my mom did

53:52.840 --> 53:59.560
how i want to remember my brother by sanfinch the thing i remember is that one he made up his

53:59.560 --> 54:05.000
mind that was it i broke his we foot

54:09.800 --> 54:13.720
my brother said he'd die before you another mushroom and he did

54:16.600 --> 54:21.960
at barbara's funeral we swore he'd never be afraid again and he wasn't

54:22.520 --> 54:26.440
i think calvin always wanted to fly

54:36.920 --> 54:40.360
that day he finally made up his mind to do it

54:42.840 --> 54:44.840
i told him going around was impossible

54:48.680 --> 54:50.040
maybe if i hadn't said that

54:52.920 --> 54:54.840
forget are we going to do a circle let's go

54:56.680 --> 54:58.200
maybe it's the one time i'm picked up

55:00.440 --> 55:02.920
tell the one i can do the circle and maybe

55:05.960 --> 55:09.960
oh shit i'm about to kill him wait a moment he's already made up his mind

55:13.880 --> 55:15.800
that's why i remember about my brother

55:17.240 --> 55:20.600
i think i'm about to pop his bogs if he does a circle hold on

55:22.520 --> 55:26.520
this

55:26.520 --> 55:28.520
hey

55:39.080 --> 55:40.280
did he know learn to swim

55:46.120 --> 55:46.440
what

55:46.440 --> 55:50.440
it calvin's story felt strangely familiar

55:50.440 --> 55:53.400
when i was younger i remember trying to do the exact same thing

55:55.800 --> 56:01.640
a stony there's rocks below okay okay sorry okay i'm too slow for this game i think

56:04.680 --> 56:08.520
okay right okay i may have just perished that child but you can't prove it

56:09.240 --> 56:12.680
okay oh he's got to be plaque thing in here like that wife draws

56:12.680 --> 56:18.600
after the funeral oh eddie roped off calvin's house the room

56:19.480 --> 56:24.840
oh roped off okay i understand the company mom said grab a sam enlisted at 18 and

56:24.840 --> 56:28.600
never set foot in the room again oh i went into the army

56:35.160 --> 56:38.840
the hungry caterpillar or something

56:39.640 --> 56:44.840
oh what is that i looked a bit too

56:49.800 --> 56:50.040
made

56:56.040 --> 57:01.000
wait all the finches have popped their clogs but me the passages were a pretty tight fit

57:02.280 --> 57:04.840
they'd obviously been built for smaller hands and bellies

57:09.240 --> 57:15.320
okay that's the hallway right that's fine you're the last finch alive i believe it

57:20.120 --> 57:23.400
growing up i always thought of barbara as a child star

57:25.240 --> 57:29.560
okay i never thought about how hard it must have been for her afterwards

57:30.200 --> 57:39.160
i hear that some people get a very unique complex after stardom is over

57:41.560 --> 57:47.320
the thing moldy do not eat that she can't even eat yeah like stardom can cause like

57:47.320 --> 57:49.720
you some you know very strange

57:53.720 --> 57:58.040
of all the stories people wrote about barbara's death i'm surprised eddie saved this one

57:59.000 --> 57:59.960
why is it real

58:05.400 --> 58:14.040
old jack here with another ghastly tale inspired by america's most unfortunate family

58:14.840 --> 58:20.840
i'm calling it the surprise ending of barbara rich

58:21.320 --> 58:28.360
as a child star barbara was famous for her screen

58:31.320 --> 58:35.800
now at 16 she was all washed up her has been

58:37.400 --> 58:44.120
but in a lucky break she'd been asked to perform her signature scream at a local convention for

58:44.120 --> 58:47.720
monster movie fans it was just the boost

58:50.680 --> 58:54.840
unfortunately her scream hadn't aged where

58:58.520 --> 59:03.800
me i think you just need the right motivation her biggest fan

59:06.280 --> 59:09.560
either or was about to demonstrate when

59:09.560 --> 59:20.440
now that is that will help it was barbara's father saying he'd slipped into a table saw

59:20.440 --> 59:27.400
and had to be rushed to the emergency room so barbara that stuck babysitting her youngest

59:27.400 --> 59:32.120
brother walter a convention comeback was cancelled

59:32.840 --> 59:41.640
okay i'm hearing frustration but i'm not hearing terror what if i tried a gang of hoodlums

59:41.640 --> 59:45.480
in halloween mass have been terrorizing orca's island tonight police are urging residents

59:47.480 --> 59:52.440
that came from the basement you're right i came for the basement i loved your delivery on that

59:53.000 --> 59:58.040
why is your basement door locked because my dad likes making puzzles and secret passages

59:58.760 --> 01:00:05.080
there's a key hidden in the music box the secret is to keep winding and winding

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:10.360
until finally the key pops out thanks babe i'll be back in a sec

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:19.880
and we know what to do rick hadn't returned so barbara remember that story i'm writing it down

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.240
right on q

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.800
she reached for the music box

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.440
am i doing an encomic

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:49.720
they really want to tell you where the key is

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:55.720
she found a mix scratch and imagined the worst

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.560
the gang's leader is the infamous hook man killer dr carl hamlin who unveiled in an eight

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:13.720
his family 10 years ago tonight

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:25.720
okay

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:42.040
barb relax i was just trying to scare you to help you find your screen well i'm not scared rick

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:49.880
i'm furious then act furious all i'm getting from you now is that you're hurt and confused

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:59.000
she threw him out but you kept the little something to remember him barb crutch have

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:05.080
you seen my other crutch and she was still holding it when she fell asleep watching the

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:13.720
late late picture show hours later barbara walter what's going on up there

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:20.520
okay i'm coming up but if this is a trick we're dead

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:29.480
uh continues all right we'll be walking

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.480
a roller plate

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.480
let's care of the

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.480
halter are you there

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.280
wow

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:49.080
vanished

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:49.480
huh

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:56.920
orca's island police describe the man as six feet tall with a steel hook for a hand

01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:02.040
resident search of all doors and windows and notified the police of any suspicious activity

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:05.320
oh i'm getting drunk

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.320
this is how she pops her clothes

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:32.600
oh he went like there's gotta be another way out of here he went like crazy

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:37.080
she played our part beautifully

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.800
well is this our last rule type of idea

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.760
right that's a bathroom

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:54.520
oh sorry forgot sorry wait

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:57.720
let me go out

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.240
beam the fuck up

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:12.200
yeah

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.680
right we need to beat him up literally gang violence him

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:25.400
the the rules are off i don't care if he's passed out we're beating him in smithereens

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:29.720
i want to see brain matter i'm not finished until we see brain matter did i make myself clear

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:31.480
no

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:41.000
no

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:48.280
okay who's at the door we don't see you

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.120
i'm inside the house

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:04.520
oh we're getting oh dear oh dear

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:10.680
what

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:14.680
what

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:27.480
she saw what kind of monsters they were and she realized what was about to happen

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:40.680
i know brandy Barbara Finch gave the performance of her life

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:54.040
i wasn't there myself but i hear Barbara was magnificent

01:05:55.080 --> 01:06:03.800
poor girl she had a taste for stardom but unfortunately so did her fans

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:10.680
of course the police blamed it all on poor rick who disappeared the same night

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:19.480
and little walter hiding under his bed the whole time he took it all pretty hard

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:28.520
but that's another story as for Barbara tucked inside the music box is all they ever found of her

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:30.520
her

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:37.640
oh now that's what i call a real fear retail

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:47.160
oh that was good

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:56.440
that was very unique that one he told me all Barbara wanted was to be remembered

01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:01.240
as absurd as that comic was maybe what edie saw was a happy ending

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:04.440
how

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.880
okay so we know we need to go to the music box

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:16.920
but we can't unlock these doors we need to go back in the ear on the back the end

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:20.840
boo that joke sucks i guess now i know my mom doesn't like me playing with the music box

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.120
what oh what rub an eerie tale

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:34.520
there we go we got them in 40 i've already forgotten what the box unlocks uh oh the basement

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:40.440
the basement the basement i remember it's all about reading between the lines of this game

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:48.600
what is your guess and how she died um i need to read oh god i have to think wait a minute i

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:56.520
thought i didn't have to think in this game keep going keep going keep going keep going hey big

01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:03.000
hey we uh she died a ligma you know what that's funny but you're not allowed to say that

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:13.080
okay we're in the boss mints any basement dwellers i dwell the basement in fact i am the biggest

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:18.920
basement dweller of law i was like a bit the idea of a basement but they're not a thing

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:25.160
mom said the basement was off limits unless i wanted another tetanus shot

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:33.000
sudden not living disease the shift oh these are the bases of where we put our dead family

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:39.400
members faces on hmm what were you making you were making a dragon concept of the sleigh they guess

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:44.760
that's where he messed up his hand i saw eddie sneak down to the basement once

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:50.360
carrying packages what kind of packages right let's see what's in the fridge she was hiding

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:59.160
presents what's in the fridge oh turned out she was hiding a lot more than that can i go in please

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:05.000
i can hardly see nothing don't worry if you can't see nothing i can't see nothing either

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.400
we're in the same boat here because my name i remember asking mom once about where walter had

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:15.400
gone we have a main shaft under the house he got as far away as he could

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:24.840
we got folly bunker oh this is kind of cool stories down here wait one

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:32.040
anonymous careful i think mercy's hating the dead senpai's down here you leave mercy out of

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:39.000
she made i think it's that none of us has gotten very far wait this is so cool though sorry this

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:50.440
is cool yes walter walter white i like everyone just have a goodbye everyone oh i can't believe i've

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:59.160
been down here for 30 years he just rolled on that first day after the shaking started i didn't

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:02.280
think i survived

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:12.760
oh i lived as a hermit but after a few days i settled into a routine that's what kept me sane

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.920
having a stable living for today

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:24.280
mm mango they always expected to be dead tomorrow

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:29.000
January 1976

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:40.040
here i was rumbling they're tumbling but let me adjust on my chair and putting my feet up

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:45.000
even a monster on the other side of the door starts to feel normal

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:51.960
almost friendly did he have agriphobia and you couldn't go outside

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.040
and then one day everything just

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:10.440
2005 yes whatever that thing was it was gone maybe you got tired of waiting

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:14.600
he thought maybe i just got tired of being afraid

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:23.320
ate too much peaches and died of confusion got botchers and via cans it's been a week now

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:35.960
the longest in 30 years uh-huh i'm done waiting i have to leave well i still can okay okay let's

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:39.320
this let's do it let's do it

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:47.640
play easily easy we're an old man i don't call much exercise in this

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.400
i know it's out there somewhere

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:01.000
whatever killed barbra

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:07.160
murder the cat

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:24.840
any break the wall maybe this is all a mistake with sleigh time or no shovel

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:31.880
but i need to stop living the same day even if it kills me

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:42.280
whatever's out there i want you to know i'm ready for it

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:47.880
this is a train track so that explains the shaking i'm going to appreciate all of it especially the food

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:56.120
i don't mind if i only have a year left why have we got a timer for a month

01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:59.320
maybe we should get up a train track

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.320
yeah i can already imagine the sun

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:15.240
i mean

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:20.360
yeah

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:27.880
walter died when i was six i can't believe my mom never told me he was down here

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.760
a truly a cursed family honestly

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:42.200
i'm sure my mom was trying to protect me

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:49.400
is this like a window yeah i was actually really smart sorry that's really smart

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:55.560
little plywood behind there you could say he followed his train of thought

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:05.160
oh okay i mean look i'm just trying to bring light to the game like relaxed

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:12.440
do we use the letters dolti

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.120
maybe she was afraid i'd end up like walter

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.320
he went a little off the rails

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:26.120
but if she might call me about an uncle under the house

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.680
i can only imagine what else she was hiding

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:33.800
it's like all his supplies just been showing me i guess

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:36.120
i don't want to make the same mistakes she made

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.360
trying to bury something that's still alive

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:50.840
i think that i have the only one of us left or maybe two i think i have the emotional

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:57.720
intelligence of like a jellyfish because am i supposed to be crying no i wonder i think if

01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:00.680
you because you told me i would be sad

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:08.120
yeah i found out what happened to everyone else i think you just told me it was sad my

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:11.880
brain's like proper prepared but now i'm worried the stories themselves might be the problem

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:19.880
i know my brain is over prepared maybe we believed so much in a family curse we made it real

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.560
oh it's just me memorial

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.440
kind of like later or anything

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:34.920
just experience but okay okay okay i i know over i don't know if i should even be writing this

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:37.560
you can write what you look

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:41.160
light head

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.800
maybe it'd be better if all this just died with me

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:53.080
me a bit more bits a bit more of a silent a bit more bits but i thought you should know about

01:15:53.080 --> 01:16:05.000
your family who i'm a finch and the history you're a part of the monka family curse the

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.200
monka one to be honest i feel as lost as you probably do right now

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:21.080
i think the people in these stories believed them for what that's worth

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:31.960
me

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:43.880
okay i can look at the house yeah that history of imagination and stubbornness and madness

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.160
any of it seems possible

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:55.080
i was gonna say that game keeping anything out it's for accessory

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:05.080
i think we've been surrounded by death for so long we've just gotten used to it

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:11.320
i am going to do one thing what kind of family finishes building a cemetery before starting the

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:20.040
house no is that real oh that's rough it's embarrassing for me to admit this but

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:26.120
that's rough the cemetery may be more uncomfortable than the human one

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:31.160
three of the gerbils are mine and two had been my fault

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:40.360
zui's derpy lurpy furpy chirpy burpy derpy derpy junior lucid easy charlie tucker co-co-rip

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:45.480
and bailey of course oh wait is bailey a person i think bailey may be a person

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:50.920
oh there's another one bob shadow oliver christopher

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:55.320
what

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:02.200
spend up the house but it was edie who designed the cemetery

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:14.120
oh i get you i was a look in the past the cat was a past

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:25.480
oh that's adorable wait did they all have that no they don't hey you be

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:35.160
ah i'm not smart enough oh right she got her own star i'm sure odin's monument had been edie's idea

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:40.440
my mom was always trying to move on but three the past never went away

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.480
she's thinking how

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:49.480
she could see it poking out of the water at low tide

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:55.960
that's the previous house

01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:04.440
magalek's one edie said she dreamed about the old house every night

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:09.880
oh it's got a caution boy that goes in the water

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:12.600
did anything else

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:19.000
was this supposed to be anything hope not

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:24.040
the old house and all that was wrong

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.320
edie's side was always easier for me to understand

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:31.000
yeah

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:36.600
but the older i get the more i can see where my mom was coming from

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:43.320
her dad had been pretty strict but it wasn't enough to save her brothers

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.240
she was just trying to do better

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:54.200
she lost two of her brothers just like i did i get why she tried so hard to protect us

01:19:54.840 --> 01:20:01.720
got so far we never found melton's body so my mom insisted we were putting up a monument

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:10.600
not a tombstone we never found a body aren't we about to come across the skeleton

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:17.880
there's so many things i wish i could ask my mom now part of me thinks this is what she wanted

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:24.360
all along for me to come back someday and find everything out for myself

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:32.360
this wood is fantastic they don't make wood like this anymore

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:39.640
this has been years in the making and it's still stable and all but looking back on it now

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.400
if she told me there was going to be so much climbing

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:49.400
i never would have come when i was 22 weeks pregnant

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:56.040
oh is she your prego you're 17 and 22 weeks pregnant hold on a minute i thought you were 17

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:09.240
the book is to the child that she's pregnant with she's telling the family history to the

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:15.400
wane and her bailey i never met her as him but i think he and my mom had a lot in common

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:20.120
well it chilled up for a very short lifespan

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:24.600
they were both pretty intense

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:33.880
whoa my oh she caught me was she so smart so they aren't cursed they're just stupid honestly i

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:35.560

all these stories that's the one i wish most that my mom had told me

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.440
the revenge of nature

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:20.840
traumatizes daughter in 4k literally Sam spent his life shooting photos but mom said he got

01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:24.360
nervous being in front of the camera i guess we're all afraid of something

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:28.760
see that we door there i'm just gonna check instead of hiding from dad

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:32.680
sam seemed to go out of his way to meet it god

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:42.680
mitten's worth his attack in the foot out of that squirrel oh my god he'd be in it he'd be in his

01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:44.680
ass

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:47.480

i have just mom and eddie oh my god they shat

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.440
sorry i'm just seeing how it is

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:38.200
Gregory you're in the vents you're acting so

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:45.240
oh the baby oh no the baby popped its clogs so young what happened

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.280
and the baby got taken in the divorce

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:55.800
dear k do you remember the way Gregory used to laugh when he thought he was alone

01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:01.720
like something funny was happening but only he could see it schizophrenia and childhood

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:06.920
i got barbie oh he drowned

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:09.640
i think there's some things the rest of us don't

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:24.920
the child drowned

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:37.320
oh the child drowned you're never to leave a child unattended in a bar

that was a bit brutal i have to admit

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:48.440
cool that was brutal

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:54.280
oh

01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:58.200
never leave a child i can't imagine my mom ever writing poetry and yet

01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:07.000
i had a an acquaintance she wasn't a friend like i didn't know her like that and she had a five-year-old

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:11.640
and he was having a bubble bath on his own and you think five-year-old would be fine

01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:18.120
don't worry nothing happened um but she went away she literally that's that's exactly what

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:22.040
happened she went away on a phone call and she came back and he went mummy almost drowned

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:25.320
and she's like what do you mean pull yourself up because you know there's handlebars on the

01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:32.520
side of the bathtubs and he was like i just couldn't the bath was too slippery and uh yeah

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:36.360
she was like really freaked out because he was five years old you thought he was old enough to

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:40.840
like have a bath by his own but it just goes to show like that stuff's dangerous like it's so

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:48.760
dangerous i'm so serious about that so you can't even um a poem for gus who always said the wedding

01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:55.560
was a bad idea our father never hit us kids at least not very hard before the day my brother said

01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:59.720
with teenage disregard that he'd be dead before he'd see a wedding in our yard

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:00.600
so

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:11.960
people can drown in an inch of war yeah like there's there's no frame or reason why someone

01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:18.360
my father made him come of course but gus stood far apart just flew his kite and bottled up the

01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:19.640
storm inside his heart

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:30.680
it's like a co-sleeping with a baby

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:36.360
we don't need a stepmom or the words

01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:41.160
i now pronounce you husband and wife you make him cry

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:49.160

right look for the secret gray layers

01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:31.800

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:33.720
oh there they are

01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:38.120

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.280
thunder sounded much too close and full of angry power

01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:20.120
but all my father said to this was make the music louder

01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:24.920
oh this can be

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:31.880
so

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:42.040

louis was born a year later oh they fell in love and they kissed me

01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:11.080
when my dad died i don't think mom knew where else to go i'm sure eddie was happy to have her back

01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:19.960
the house had to get a little can i impregnate you where did that come from

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:21.400
um

01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:31.800
and for a while lots of school things were good almost normal great job

01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:39.560
analyze objectively never stop learning assume nothing which make criticism as

01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:45.320
oh this is like a proper oh there's a gerbil cage

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:49.560
too a medurable put it in last

01:39:52.360 --> 01:40:02.200
scientific method observation question research hypo sun hypothesis experiment data conclusion

01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:09.400
to teach and to learn don't think

01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:18.920
speak your truth brother beginning of the end was melton's 10th birthday when eddie gave him a castle

01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:27.080
we're looking the people melton there's no death the only thing he left behind was a room full of

01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:31.560
paintings there's no death notice that there's no death number

01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:37.720
so

01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:39.000
you sure got us with a lock

01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:44.200
who's that so nice oh they're very nice

01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:52.280
i think eddie was happy to finally have another painter in the family

01:40:53.000 --> 01:41:07.560
i do not have that kind of strength i'mma tell you that right now i do not have that kind of strength

01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:14.840
okay

01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:16.120
it's a story

01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:19.960
melton finch in the magic paintbrush is a flip book

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:23.560
it is

01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:29.160
painting he's gonna sneeze

01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:31.240
at you

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:38.840
and he draws with the paintbrush given and never doing fourth wall breaking

01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:46.200
he's painting he's painting he's painting a door that's the door that's downstairs i saw that

01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:49.960
the door opens and he says adieu

01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:55.000
curious what we're gonna find downstairs then

01:41:55.560 --> 01:42:01.480
wait up that's just as we story i was four when melton disappeared

01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:09.080
i'm getting nervous

01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:20.600
let's go down mom spent months searching for my brother and she sealed the doors

01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:27.800
is there anything there's nothing special about it

01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:45.800
i mean whatever melton had found in the house mom didn't want it getting out

01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:50.920
they're rather strange

01:42:55.400 --> 01:43:01.800
these are just to be in my way classic it's a metaphor in it oh don't i need that i

01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:04.600
honestly need logic to understand how to stuff in the game

01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:13.160
it's fine we'll just lift you up you don't need playing okay thank you because i have no upper body

01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:20.200
strength any lake challenge give me a lake to be blamed eddie but i think louis blamed himself

01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:27.240
after he graduated he just spent more and more time in his room until mom got him a job at the cannery

01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:35.720
i mean some jobs can give you purpose everyone always told me to stay out of louis's room

01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:37.400
except louis

01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:44.120
i'm curious oh we cannot go that way don't don't think we can go that way

01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:50.920
oh we're in a boat they used to live in a boat

01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:59.080
it's heavy but we're doing it

01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:03.960
he used to get high in a boat honestly

01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:13.000
louis's room smelled very very familiar that part of him lived on past the weed past the liquor

01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:19.000
louis spent a lot of time doing zaza i can't remember but he was surprisingly bad at them

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:20.520
he died a lot

01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:27.800
you got high school diploma oh wait do you actually get that do you guys get an actual certificate

01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:30.120
when you finish high school like this

01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:34.360
uh we don't have this

01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:42.120
he was so proud of being indian i think for him it was a way to oh you do all this fantastic

01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:46.600
just a pinch oh that's cute how cute adorable i love it

01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:49.720
oh here we go

01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:51.800
uh

01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:59.000
psycho institute psychology

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:04.920
as louis's psychiatrist i can understand your desire for an explanation as i see it the trouble

01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:09.960
began in january shortly after we convinced your son to seek treatment for substance abuse

01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:15.080
newly sober i believe louis first noticed the monotony of his daily life

01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:22.440
he kept working at the canon

01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:29.320
but he withdrew part of himself in our sessions i saw the same behavior

01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:32.520
his mind began to

01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:36.600
do substance abuse

01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:39.320
i can't reach it

01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:48.760
can't reach i shoved my hand in this oh yeah no you can touch it it's fine i'm telling you wonder

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:51.320
oh

01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:56.920
i asked him to describe it

01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:04.200
he said he started small imagining a labyrinth

01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:07.160
he'd feel his way about

01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:13.480
then something moved that's

01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:16.520
and turns

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:17.080
it's

01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:24.680
we've got a cape like magic to gathering

01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:28.600
and things that have not names

01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:32.920
he knew it was all in his head

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:44.040
but he took it very seriously i had hoped he'd find himself

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.160
a cheeky bit of psychosis

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:50.920
i can't believe playing winscape mid-game sorry guys

01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:52.120
but he found something more

01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:54.200
the drugs

01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:57.960
i worried about him then

01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:00.920
they were dreaming at the canary

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.200
i spoke with his boss

01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:08.760
but he said louis had become a model employee

01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:12.200
methodical tires focused

01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:17.160
but he secretly daydream in like all the time a whole new louis

01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:22.760
so i let him go on

01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:25.880
is that our first mistake

01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:31.160
i even encouraged him

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:35.240
it seemed very promising at first

01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:40.600
psychosis means we can't he told me he'd made a new friend

01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:49.240
on the edge of a city he named louis topia

01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:53.480
he built city up slowly brick by brick

01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:57.400
then he made musicians

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:07.880
and songs for them to play

01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:13.720
he talked about starting a band

01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:18.920
and he was always humming

01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:25.000
every day his imagination grew stronger

01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:32.120
he no longer spoke at the canary

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.200
everything was in his head

01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:37.480
his chopping was as reliable as ever

01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:40.680
then one day it struck him

01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:43.720
it struck him

01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:45.320
at all the cheering crowds

01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:47.560
even the stones under his feet

01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:51.640
more desirable than reality

01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:55.080
so he could do whatever he wished

01:48:57.400 --> 01:48:58.440
and he became king

01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:02.040
he held an election for me

01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:06.280
and he won

01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:09.960
mario reference

01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:11.880
they begged him to stay

01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:13.640
but his mind was already wandering

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:17.320
it became a game for him

01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:24.680
now you can see a life of the

01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:26.760
conquer city then immediately push on

01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:31.960
new louis

01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:37.080
notice how the chopin's choir as well

01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:37.800
saint louis

01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:43.400
he started drifting away from our reality

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:49.800
a little bit of a crash but it's okay

01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:52.600
no i didn't expect the wind

01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:55.560
until one day he forgot to go home from the canary

01:49:57.880 --> 01:49:59.640
even as his mother pleaded with him

01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:02.040
part of louis kept sailing on

01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:19.080
in louisburg he heard rumors of her

01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:26.920
handsome queen wait hold on a minute

01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:30.920
hold on a minute a pretty queen

01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:34.200
no i'm a messed up did i do the wrong choice

01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:38.360
the queen was on her own quest for

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:41.880
radiant rainbows

01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:51.960
sorry let's try that again

01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:56.440
sorry i ain't got that kind of action you know

01:50:58.440 --> 01:50:59.720
he followed the sound of her

01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:01.640
silver heart

01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:06.200
silver heart

01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:08.360
we are literally just doing middle

01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:10.040
earth right now sorry i said it

01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:20.280
i'm coming my queen

01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:26.520
his chase led him to a golden palace east of the sun and west of the moon

01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:30.120
yeah what's inside the palace

01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:32.360
even then his logic remained sound

01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:34.280
we can't see nothing now

01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:36.520
oh

01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:40.520
there's my world was all in his imagination

01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:51.960
i'm trying i'm trying to get rid of the difficulties on screen

01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:53.400
proud of having created it

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.280
in his own eyes he becomes something greater than a king

01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:08.520
that's a lot of servants or warriors

01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:13.240
for someone who'd never known success in the real world i think it was overwhelming

01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:21.000
and then it struck him that the real louis was not the one chopping salmon

01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:24.200
but the one climbing the steps of the golden palace

01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:25.880
i'm marrying his queen

01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:27.960
hmm

01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:34.680
my imagination is as real as my body

01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:37.960
he told me it was hard to argue with him

01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:47.160
so what happened

01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:51.240
do you wonder which walker is his

01:52:56.760 --> 01:53:00.360
why he took too much ellis

01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:01.960
began to forget the world we know

01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:12.600
i think it pained him to remember louis the cannery worker

01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:21.960
did he self end the game question mark

01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:28.040
he began to despise the man with a royal contempt

01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:38.040
did what happens if i interact i don't know

01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:42.200
does he sell

01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:46.680
i still thought i could save him

01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:49.640
oh he ends the game

01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:53.160
even after he said he was being crowned king over all the lands of wonder

01:53:55.080 --> 01:54:00.120
uh oh maybe the palace would be packed with his companions

01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:06.600
maybe he doesn't

01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:13.320
i don't i don't know how likely he doesn't but

01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:17.000
including the wise calico and his sister don't advise him

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:27.000
molly

01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:30.680
i'm enjoying the wind

01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:41.320
his queen waited holding his crown

01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:46.280
that guillotine

01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:50.680
that's a guillotine

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.680
oh

01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:12.680
oh my god

01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:19.480
on the west i think you know

01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:24.680
mrs finch your son was a kind man who will be missed by all of us who knew him

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:32.680
um

01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:44.680
my brother was really cool i wish you could have met him

01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:54.120
is that because of the psychedelics i heard psychedelics um ruin your brain

01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:57.880
like they make it so you can't go back to before

01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:05.000
the yeah i don't want her to have a baby either i don't know why she was like let's get pregnant

01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:09.080
no maybe don't my mom told me to start packing

01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:17.000
she waited until the day before we left to tell edie i'm not sure if she wanted to make it easier or

01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:18.680
harder

01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:34.680
i wish we'd stayed but i understand why we left

01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:43.080
my mom ended up leaving everything behind

01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:45.400
she didn't care for it

01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:59.640
is that our father oh okay no what happened that night had been coming for a long time

01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:05.640
what happened that maybe it should have come sooner did she hang herself

01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:09.320
did she hang herself

01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:13.240
i'm a little bit nervous

01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:17.880
but it had to end one way or another

01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:22.840
what did you do all that's left now is to tell you about that last night

01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:28.680
wait those are the statues that come in for me

01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:33.320
i'm scared i don't

01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:38.360
i don't want to see my prego belly

01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:52.200
that whole last day edie just watched his pack and didn't say a word

01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:56.200
until supper when she raised her glass and said

01:57:57.160 --> 01:58:06.120
to our final night together and all our final nights apart grandma you know what i said about alcohol

01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:13.000
some of your medications are very specific i left a present for you in the hallway why don't you go open it

01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:20.920
the grown-ups have to argue now i'm sorry you're right we're all leaving tomorrow let's just enjoy our laps

01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:24.040
i'm not leaving edith you're excused

01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:33.160
are you squidding me right now

01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:42.280
the power had been shut off that morning but edie always had plenty of candles

01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:46.920
when my mom said the library i don't think she knew about the other entrance

01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:49.720
or that edie had a key to it

01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:54.040
i don't think i'm gonna like what i'm saying

01:58:56.680 --> 01:58:58.040
i'm nervous

01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:04.680
i think you're afraid of isn't going to end when you leave the house

01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:16.040
edith has a right to know these stories my children are dead because of your stories

01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:19.400
i think it's best if edith and i leave tonight

01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:26.600
we'll have the nursing home spend a van for you in the morning okay

01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:43.080
dear edith there's so many stories i wish i could tell you but there's only time for one

01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:46.840
this is about what happened on the night you were born

01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:52.680
hmm that night the tide went way way out

01:59:55.240 --> 02:00:01.000
it was the first and last time i ever saw the old house aground

02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:06.200
there'd been an earthquake out in the middle of the ocean

02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:12.280
they called it the lowest tide in a thousand years

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:21.800
god it smelled awful you know i've seen that house every day of my life

02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:29.800
but i never thought i'd go back to it

02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:37.480
when the fog rolled in i lost my way

02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:47.480
i got turned around

02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:00.200
for a while i wondered

02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:09.480
i started seeing things

02:01:12.680 --> 02:01:18.840
things i'd forgotten had ever existed

02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:32.360
but when i saw them they felt like old friends that night a lot of things came back to me

02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:36.360
or maybe i came back to them

02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:43.960
i like the detail that is settled on the house because of the water

02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:53.480
things i can't explain but that i need you to try and edith what are you doing in here

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:57.720
it's mine edith mom you're gonna rip it let go

02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:05.000
i kicked in screen but mom's driving a car

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:11.080
so we're about to finish it i never saw a great grandma edie again

02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:19.320
me the next morning the van came to pick her up but she was already gone

02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:24.440
gone is in after that we moved around a lot

02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:38.440
we both tried to make the best of it

02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:44.440
a few years went by

02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:00.040
my mom didn't like to talk about it

02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:05.160
but she started getting sick a lot

02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:09.640
the rest happened pretty quickly

02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:15.720
yeah shit she got better for a while

02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:19.640
she didn't

02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:25.240
and then i was alone

02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:31.960
the last inch left alive

02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:38.520
until i found out about you

02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:44.520
her egg was prego i'm still not sure what to tell you about all this

02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:51.160
if we lived forever maybe we'd have time to understand things

02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:56.520
but as it is i think the best we can do is try to open our eyes

02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:02.920
well your family appreciate how strange and brief all of this is

02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:07.720
is that her cervix

02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:14.200
this journal was supposed to be for you

02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:17.560
are we in utero

02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:26.440
it's better not be the birth canal

02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:33.640
it's the pregnancy is more for real

02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:40.440
i just want to meet you and tell you all these stories myself

02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:43.800
but i guess if you're reading this now

02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:48.360
things didn't work out that way

02:04:56.840 --> 02:05:01.320
she died this is where your story begins i'm sorry i won't be there to see it

02:05:02.040 --> 02:05:08.600
it's a lot to ask but i don't want you to be sad that i'm gone i want you to be amazed

02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:12.360
that any of us ever had a chance to be here at all good luck

02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:14.780
you

02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:20.360
oh my boy

02:05:44.120 --> 02:05:44.520
you

02:05:57.640 --> 02:05:58.120
that's it

02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:03.160
i guess he really is what remains of edith's finch

02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:14.920
um i'm sorry

02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:25.400
right i think i think for future reference if i'm ever gonna play a sad game don't tell

02:06:25.400 --> 02:06:32.280
me it's a sad game because i mentally shielded myself from like greeting my eyes out

02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:39.240
and i think i over shielded myself to the point where i was like yeah i guess

02:06:43.640 --> 02:06:45.640
is there a disgust about you

02:06:49.160 --> 02:06:56.280
that was curious i'm not sure what i think because i have the emotional intelligence

02:06:56.280 --> 02:07:01.720
of a camel that it didn't really hit i'm not the demographic like

02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:09.080
but is it objectively bad no not at all not at all

02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:13.800
and the achievement says thanks johan

02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:23.720

02:07:49.080 --> 02:07:59.160
and actually you want my sweaty hands and feet on your face that was very creative very curious

02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:07.400
um you couldn't tell literally listen to the brotherhood stream and tell me what you

psychedelic or not everyone wants to be seen as special yes and then just think of it

02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:29.000
uh yes uh psychosis is such a dangerous thing to even like comprehend because what you see is

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:34.680
reality that other person has absolutely no perception of it is it's fascinating if you get

02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:42.680

taken a day off since debut question mark i really enjoy streaming um and i enjoy having a first

02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:21.560
time and streaming enables me to play games for the first time like i got to play suica for the

02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:27.640
first time yesterday i got to play supermarket simulator for the first time in july i got to do

02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:33.400
what other games did i get to play for the first time okay those were the only ones i got to play

02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:39.800
spiral technically but i was very sick that stream so that doesn't really count um the day she takes

02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:46.760
a day off is the day she hates us exactly balochro doesn't count no because i've got to play that

02:14:46.760 --> 02:14:52.440
before please don't overdo it you see girl was really entertaining reminding me why the game

02:14:52.440 --> 02:15:00.280
was injured really i thought it was about but that's just that's just my two pennies

02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:04.760
that's just my opinion i'm getting blinded

02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:13.800
i'm getting actually i can blinded yeah damn yeah damn right okay i've just put the dark mode on

02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:21.560

02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:41.480
ten hours straight oh wait until i tell you about the freaking weirdest part about skits for any

02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:47.560
medication if you stop taking the meds they will never ever work for you again it's it's bizarre

02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:52.680
if you use them and then you get off them because you're like i'm better now i don't have

02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:56.600

so if you need to focus on a spiral you can you can focus on the bigger one whilst the

02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:02.360
background one does it for you

02:18:05.640 --> 02:18:10.680
and then there's me i'm a call fish i'm a siren that can't sing and i'm a call fish

02:21:01.480 --> 02:21:06.440
hey strongy i just wanted to be a weeb itselfish go for it when you watch your gen mate's vods can

02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:10.680
you only share with us the timestamp the same way i would greatly appreciate not seeing the

02:21:10.680 --> 02:21:17.960
board restreamed on your stream thank you very much for your consideration can i do that

02:21:21.240 --> 02:21:32.280
okay i think i can do that i yeah yeah i think i can do that okay good thing you asked because

02:21:32.280 --> 02:21:39.080
i was going to just straight up put it on my stream in the corner um it would give the girls

02:21:39.080 --> 02:21:44.600
more views as usual yes okay mod's put the reefling in the timer box wait what did you do

02:21:46.120 --> 02:21:51.400
Scottish and then you pronounce the t inkling language wow you do something like

02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:58.200
you owe me 40 000 bells how are you gonna repay a reefling

02:21:58.280 --> 02:22:05.640
i'm confused by the request oh i think it just means like it doesn't go in front of the

02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:10.760
gameplay and stuff because i would have to layer it on top of the gameplay and then i can like

02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:14.520
pin what the vodas were watching and like you can see the timestamp so anyone who comes in can

02:22:14.520 --> 02:22:19.080
literally just join in you don't need to download anything because all the streams are there i get

02:22:19.080 --> 02:22:28.520

the mechas um i had already known ic me sheebie mersey isra for many months actually i have an

02:33:11.480 --> 02:33:18.440
idea for a puzzle stream i made really cringy cringy memes of the girls that they could post

02:33:18.440 --> 02:33:26.280
on twitter they're all pre-made but i made them before the girls came in and if we do another

02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:34.680
puzzle reveal stream like a stream snipe thing once i get a few more things then um i might show

02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:41.480
off the cringy memes they're so bad like they're like the worst like bitposting memes that you

02:33:41.480 --> 02:33:49.960
could imagine um like i saw one of them yesterday in ic's file and i was like why did i make this

02:33:49.960 --> 02:33:57.880
it's so bad um cringe memes signed me oh literally i made everyone like five memes each

02:33:57.880 --> 02:34:02.040
and i was like you can just put this on twitter if you have nothing to say on that day and you're

02:34:02.040 --> 02:34:11.240
not streaming um i don't it's cringe oh no it's cringe like the the fucking demon core stuff

02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:14.680
and all that was made by me on ic's shorts and all that it's just so

02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:23.640
um if i if you're fine with game suggestions i enjoyed fire watch and i would say only

02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:29.400

much for hanging out on such a unique game that was that that was an interesting experience that

02:39:10.280 --> 02:39:16.040
was definitely very friendly for people who might not have had much experience in video games and

02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:23.080
just wanted quite a good narrative as well it was a very unique narrative um i would say that was um

02:39:23.960 --> 02:39:30.600
a good game personally i wouldn't replay it so i can't rank it too high wait no i need to take

02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:36.120
out my bias sorry i forgot whenever you review games you have to take out your personal bias

02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:42.840
and actually look at what's going on on the game and it was like straightforward gameplay

02:39:42.840 --> 02:39:49.720
impossible to get stuck truly impossible to get stuck um very unique narrative where you need

02:39:49.720 --> 02:39:55.080
the emotional intellect higher than a camel to understand so which is like literally the average

02:39:55.800 --> 02:40:04.680
um uh i think it was you know good game um i'd give a what would i give it an eight out of ten

02:40:05.400 --> 02:40:12.040
