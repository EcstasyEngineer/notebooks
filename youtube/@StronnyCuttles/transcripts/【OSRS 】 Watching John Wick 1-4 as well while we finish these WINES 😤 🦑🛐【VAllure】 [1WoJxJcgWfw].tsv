0	25000	I haven't really messed up the settings for this, but I'm having a stroke.
25000	54000	I think that's the timestamp for the movie.
54000	67000	Good morning, good evening, and good afternoon to all the Reflings from all across the world.
68000	72000	I can hear myself. Stop talking a moment. Stop it.
72000	75000	Closing all my tabs and...
75000	77000	Oh right, I've closed everything off.
77000	78000	Right.
78000	81000	No.
81000	84000	You may be sent yourself.
84000	85000	Strongly!
85000	91000	Wait, my mic is delayed?
91000	99000	Is my mic delayed?
99000	101000	I think...
101000	106000	I think my microphone is delayed as shit right now.
106000	108000	I just...
108000	109000	No?
109000	110000	It's a...
110000	116000	Hmm.
117000	121000	Could you raise the gain?
121000	122000	Out of sync a bit?
122000	126000	Yeah, I see that too, what the fuck?
126000	131000	Why, Mr. SMB, what's wrong with you today?
131000	133000	You're on the correct sentence.
133000	137000	Of course, like, oh my god, Mercy couldn't have spoke true words when she said,
137000	144000	everything you do, you can change not a single thing from the last thing you did yesterday.
144000	147000	And the ting's having a stroke.
147000	152000	And all the good time.
152000	155000	I don't really want to reset it because it's got filters on it.
155000	157000	I've had fucksack!
157000	159000	Yeah, the model's looking a bit odd.
159000	162000	Leave my out of sync model alone, okay?
162000	164000	The pilot...
164000	168000	The pilot and the mecha aren't cooperating, okay?
168000	171000	I can't believe it.
171000	172000	Testing.
172000	174000	What, what the fuck?
174000	177000	The SMB's delayed by, like, a second.
177000	180000	I don't want to delete it because I don't know what filters are on it.
180000	181000	Wait, I do.
181000	186000	I've got de-noise and gain on it, and I'll need a read.
186000	187000	How much gain?
187000	189000	Oh, for fuck's sake.
198000	200000	Testing.
202000	206000	Why are you delayed?
206000	208000	You're stressing me out.
208000	211000	Why?
211000	217000	I'm literally doing ventriloquism.
217000	220000	I'm watching it be so delayed in 4K.
220000	222000	What the heck?
222000	224000	Can you forgive me?
224000	226000	Can you forgive me if we...
226000	230000	Because to be honest, I'm going to be pretty quiet whilst we're watching the movie anyway.
230000	233000	Hi, good morning. I'm so sorry.
233000	236000	Right, you're just going to have to forgive me.
236000	240000	I think it might be clashing with everything I've got with the movie set up.
240000	242000	That's my only guess.
242000	243000	It's my only guess.
243000	246000	I'm not smart enough for this.
249000	250000	Let's see.
250000	252000	I mean, technically watch the movie.
252000	258000	Yeah, if you guys can forgive me practicing my ventriloquistic sensibilities,
258000	263000	then I'm just going to pretend like I'm not a second out of sync for some reason,
263000	265000	because SMB's delayed for a second.
267000	269000	Today, we are playing Grinscape.
269000	272000	I have a sugar ton of wine to level up.
272000	274000	I don't even know what world I'm in.
274000	277000	Probably not in a free world, so we can all hang out.
277000	280000	380 blaze it, please.
283000	285000	Here you go.
286000	288000	Switch world, please.
289000	291000	So me and the reflins can hang out.
291000	293000	You're so cute as a vent.
293000	294000	Can you raise the gain?
294000	296000	Of end game or me?
297000	298000	End game.
302000	304000	Assume you mean end game forever.
305000	306000	Hi.
306000	308000	Okay, my reflins are here.
308000	310000	Or do you mean the microphone?
310000	312000	Because the microphone was cool, huh?
312000	313000	Oh, wait, hold on.
314000	315000	I'm a fucking idiot.
315000	316000	How's that input?
317000	318000	Oh, that's...
318000	319000	Sorry, I'm bursting your eardrums.
319000	321000	How's that for input?
321000	323000	Oh my god, my gain was set to so low.
326000	327000	Oh, oh no.
327000	330000	My gain on the focus rate was...
330000	331000	I'm so sorry.
331000	332000	I'm so sorry.
332000	333000	I'm so sorry.
333000	334000	Sorry.
334000	335000	That's cut out.
335000	336000	No, sorry.
336000	338000	I just realized all I had to do was turn the knob.
338000	341000	You wouldn't believe how many problems in life
341000	343000	can be fixed by turning the knob.
345000	347000	Oh no, this can't be.
347000	348000	Right.
349000	351000	Right, right, right, right, right, right.
351000	353000	Let's get a cheeky update on everything
353000	355000	that's happened since I last saw you
355000	357000	in Balatro yesterday, okay?
359000	360000	Hear ye, hear ye.
360000	362000	For those of you who are a member
362000	364000	and wrote a membership script with me,
364000	367000	that audio is now live on Patreon.
367000	369000	You can hear...
369000	371000	So you can literally watch the script
371000	373000	being made in an hour,
373000	375000	and then you can listen to how...
375000	377000	It took an hour to write the damn thing,
377000	379000	took an hour to edit the damn thing,
379000	381000	and it came out to less than 15 minutes.
381000	382000	Arrest my case.
382000	385000	It literally is redonkulous
386000	389000	how long it takes to make these kind of things.
390000	393000	But yes, that audio is now out on Patreon.
393000	396000	So all four are technically five in my case
396000	399000	because I did have a demo reel to test my voice
399000	401000	because I was very confident.
402000	406000	So I technically have five audios on Patreon as well.
406000	408000	It looks like your model's behind the audio,
408000	409000	which means your model...
409000	410000	No, the model's not out of sync.
410000	412000	The SMB's out of sync.
412000	413000	This fucking thing is delayed.
413000	419000	I can see it not being in sync with me right now.
419000	420000	It's the SMB.
420000	421000	It's not the model.
421000	423000	The model's in sync.
424000	426000	And I don't know how to put a one-second delay
426000	429000	on the model input, so I can't do it.
429000	431000	It's not V2B Studio.
431000	432000	It's fine.
432000	434000	We're gonna watch John Wick.
434000	435000	It's not gonna be that bad.
435000	439000	However, however, I just don't open my model's mouth at all.
439000	442000	And then it's less frustrating for everyone watching.
444000	446000	Yeah, you didn't think about that, did you?
446000	447000	There we go.
447000	448000	Okay, next update.
448000	450000	This is fucking awful.
451000	452000	Next update.
454000	459000	My 2000 celebration subscription and video is out,
459000	461000	where I clean your ears.
461000	463000	The video almost got limited ads
463000	465000	because of my opening sentence.
469000	472000	This is the silent mouth technique, honestly.
474000	476000	So, the...
477000	478000	Aventure?
478000	482000	I can't believe Johnny got a mouth wipe shot, honestly.
482000	485000	But it's the same when you get done for your teeth.
485000	487000	My 2000 celebration is out.
487000	492000	The next audio, if you're interested in ASMR or audios,
492000	495000	is a collaboration with a wolf.
495000	498000	That's your hint, and that's all you're gonna get.
498000	500000	Teeth clenching ASMR, let's go.
500000	503000	Literally, yay, it doesn't look like I'm out of sync
503000	505000	because my lips aren't moving at all.
506000	507000	Um...
510000	512000	The viewer isn't being the eventual because of my accusations.
512000	514000	Oh, no, no, I don't know why it's not...
514000	517000	I don't know why it's delayed.
518000	522000	Anyway, I just want to preference this stream by saying
522000	525000	I'm gonna give up my all to watch all four John Wick's with you,
525000	528000	even though there's apparently a fifth one,
528000	531000	which defeats the purpose of trying to finish a series together.
532000	536000	Um, I just want to say the likelihood of tomorrow's
536000	542000	runescape endurance stream being swapped for something else
542000	546000	is astronomically high, okay?
546000	550000	I'm back to feeling sick, I'm back to feeling stressed,
550000	553000	I am back to being constipated,
553000	556000	and it happens right before the endurance stream.
556000	559000	So don't think I'm not going on to you, body.
559000	561000	I know exactly what you're doing.
561000	564000	My body is rejecting endurance streams,
564000	566000	but I'm saying no, okay?
566000	570000	Aren't you supposed to practice mental fortitude or whatever?
570000	574000	Well, mental fortitude, these wines in Edgeville,
574000	578000	I'm gonna mental fortitude so hard all over these wines.
578000	580000	Um...
580000	583000	So I'm not really sure what's going on with my body.
583000	585000	Um...
585000	589000	But my dad is coming over very soon.
589000	592000	So don't be shocked when you see streams are like
592000	594000	no more than four hours a day.
594000	597000	Like, I'm having to break up cameo in two streams,
597000	600000	which is crazy, because I can do it in one.
600000	602000	I can do it in one.
602000	605000	And like, Viva Pignata's getting broken up into two streams,
605000	607000	like all this kind of stuff.
607000	611000	I had to delay Shadow of Mordor.
611000	613000	Um...
613000	615000	Stress does wild things.
615000	618000	Literally, why the fuck does my stress manifest
618000	620000	that it clogs me full of shit?
620000	623000	Like, I'm sorry to be nasty with the details.
623000	625000	But why does mine go...
625000	627000	Oh...
627000	628000	Oh...
628000	630000	Right, we're a bit stressed, right?
630000	631000	Mmm...
631000	633000	Okay, enema, enema, give them an enema.
633000	636000	Literally, like, why does mine have to go that way?
636000	639000	Why can't I just be the, oh, I'm exhausted kind?
639000	642000	Like, yeah, I'm a wee bit tired right now.
642000	644000	I guess, yeah.
644000	646000	And I'm not sleeping properly.
646000	648000	Like, yeah, I guess.
648000	651000	But, oh my God, don't be so selfish.
651000	654000	Honestly, did you guys, like, man,
654000	656000	you were short as well about, uh,
656000	658000	not one in a VTuber agency?
658000	661000	I will put the movie on in a second.
661000	664000	Uh, A.C. picked a great time to read.
664000	666000	Oh, please tell me you didn't, A.C.
666000	668000	Snowberries, I'm so sorry.
668000	671000	Hi, A.C. and Snowberry berries.
671000	673000	Um...
673000	677000	I'm so sorry if you caught the tail end of that conversation.
677000	679000	Hopefully not.
679000	682000	Well, I'm currently having to be a ventriloquist
682000	685000	because my, uh, microphone is broken.
685000	688000	We're about to enjoy John Wick together,
688000	691000	so if you want to join in, you most certainly can.
691000	694000	There's a timestamp as well as you'll be able to see on screen
694000	696000	what we're doing, okay?
696000	699000	Uh, I just need to make sure...
699000	703000	you guys can also hear...
703000	706000	Snowberries? Snowberries?
706000	707000	Snowberries?
707000	710000	What? Would you still love A.C. if she was Southern?
710000	712000	Well, how do y'all Snowberries?
712000	716000	Oh, gee, sons, what are you talking about?
716000	719000	What do you mean we can't get the hand-jerking off Booth?
719000	721000	Yeah, that's right. I saw that tweet, A.C.
721000	724000	I saw what happened.
724000	727000	Oh, my little old, my old, gee, sons,
727000	730000	you guys are such perverts.
730000	731000	Yee-haw!
731000	733000	Yeah, we just all love A.C. if she was...
733000	735000	Oh, I'm just putting all the wings in.
735000	738000	Southern A.C. can't hurt you, she's not real.
738000	741000	Southern A.C.
741000	745000	That's right, old, gee, sons.
745000	748000	The other management's a man.
748000	750000	Whoa, wait, wait, wait.
750000	753000	So, A.C. is not allowed to jerk off station,
753000	755000	but I'm allowed the ASMR booth,
755000	757000	where I just straight up R-word reflins, right?
757000	758000	Something's not going on.
758000	759000	Something's not right.
759000	761000	I'm calling out injustice when I see it.
761000	762000	Something's not...
762000	764000	Something's not on.
764000	767000	Right, I'm gonna hit play on the movie
767000	768000	because I've got a cup of tea.
768000	770000	I love all our daughters regardless.
770000	771000	Okay, understood.
771000	775000	We'll hire a Southern A.F. for a Gen 2.
775000	777000	Okay.
777000	779000	We'd love A.C. no matter what.
779000	781000	Alabama A.C.?
781000	783000	You want Alabama A.C.?
783000	785000	We got Alabama at home.
785000	787000	In Canada, in particular...
787000	789000	Well, she's not in Canada right now, she's on holiday,
789000	792000	but yeah, we got Canada at home.
792000	794000	We got Alabama at home.
794000	796000	Her name's Emmy.
796000	798000	Strongly paid-off management.
798000	801000	Probably the physical contact aspect.
801000	802000	Yee-hee.
802000	804000	Can we get a Mongolia?
804000	806000	Wow, and we are not getting a throat singer
806000	807000	for Gen 2.
807000	808000	Absolutely not.
808000	809000	Could you imagine?
809000	810000	I swear to God.
810000	813000	Actually, you know how I've said all this stuff out loud?
813000	815000	What do you think the odds are?
815000	817000	There'll be one little shitposting girl
817000	818000	that's gonna tickle me f-
818000	820000	that's gonna tickle me ivories
820000	822000	and make me laugh by coming out with
822000	824000	doing Mongolian throat singing.
824000	826000	What do you think the odds are of that?
826000	828000	I would be...
828000	830000	I'd be very shocked.
830000	832000	But I feel like there's one that's shitposting
832000	833000	enough to do that.
833000	834000	You're telling me there's not one girl
834000	836000	shitposting enough to be like...
836000	839000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
839000	841000	That's my impression.
841000	842000	10% chance.
842000	845000	AC just wants to do ASMR to another part of the body.
845000	848000	Oh, yeah, you want pee-pee tingles?
848000	851000	I'd be glad to tell you because I'm boss.
851000	853000	For coming to visit me.
853000	857000	Oh, gee, souls, I'm gonna tingle you myself.
857000	859000	I'm gonna tingle you right here.
859000	860000	That's right.
860000	863000	Don't even need your ears for tingling.
863000	866000	Okay, shall we start with John Wick?
866000	868000	Right, are we ready?
868000	870000	Is everyone got John Wick open?
870000	874000	That's a lot to unpack.
874000	878000	Please don't listen to my crazy rambles.
878000	880000	Right, and before there's like eight slime girls
880000	882000	that apply to be in Gen 2,
882000	884000	but in their condition is I'm not gonna be
884000	887000	if I'm not slime.
887000	890000	Get your snacks.
890000	891000	Is it?
891000	896000	I've got one hour, 41 minutes and 13 seconds.
896000	899000	Everyone ready?
899000	904000	Three, two, one, go!
904000	906000	Fuck, I messed it up.
906000	909000	I'm sorry, I was gonna do the fucking ghost thing,
909000	911000	but then I fucked it up.
911000	913000	There you go.
913000	915000	It's blinding me.
915000	918000	Okay, so basically I'm gonna...
918000	920000	We're gonna enjoy the movie together.
920000	921000	Can you guys?
921000	925000	You guys can't hear the movie.
925000	926000	They're not be able to.
926000	929000	I'm gonna be nervous.
929000	932000	Oh my god, we're doing roller coaster,
932000	935000	a role play, Thunder Road.
935000	936000	Wow, that was...
936000	938000	You need to update that so badly.
938000	939000	I'm not being funny.
939000	941000	When was that made?
941000	945000	I feel like I could do better in any of these.
945000	947000	Right.
947000	950000	I've got scrawny the only snack I need.
950000	952000	Thank you, Rolly Legend.
952000	954000	And Brian.
955000	958000	I'm so out of sync.
958000	961000	Okay, you can't hear it good.
961000	962000	Oh my god, it...
962000	966000	Oh!
966000	969000	See, that's sometimes when you get your driver's license
969000	971000	at like 16 or something.
971000	972000	Oh!
972000	973000	I take it back.
973000	977000	I take it back.
977000	981000	Hold on, let me turn the game sound.
986000	990000	Are we not?
990000	991000	Is this the end of the movie?
991000	993000	Hold on a minute.
998000	1000000	Am I on the wrong movie?
1012000	1014000	Oh, they're kissing.
1015000	1017000	They're kissing.
1033000	1035000	It's been many a year.
1035000	1036000	What the fuck?
1036000	1038000	I don't remember this.
1045000	1056000	Fuckin' Elements in a mansion!
1056000	1058000	Oh my god, he's a 1%.
1058000	1059000	Get him!
1059000	1060000	No, I'm just kidding.
1060000	1062000	That's not what 1% looks like.
1062000	1064000	I assure you.
1064000	1065000	Eww!
1065000	1068000	I was the drip from the coffee cup.
1068000	1070000	That wasn't correct.
1075000	1077000	Oh, that's actually really sad.
1077000	1079000	What the fuck?
1083000	1084000	POV me.
1084000	1086000	We were nervous away for a year, Kirkin.
1086000	1087000	Oh no!
1087000	1093000	She had a brain aneurysm!
1093000	1098000	No!
1098000	1101000	Fuck!
1101000	1104000	That shit will strike.
1106000	1108000	Sorry, I might...
1111000	1113000	Holy shit, this is why we can't watch up
1113000	1115000	before anyone requests up.
1115000	1116000	No, I will start crying.
1116000	1118000	I don't want to cry.
1118000	1120000	Hold on a minute.
1132000	1134000	Oh my god.
1136000	1139000	Bro, am I going to start crying?
1139000	1141000	What the fuck?
1141000	1143000	Why is this movie so sad?
1143000	1146000	It's supposed to be about guns and pew pew!
1146000	1147000	What the fuck?
1147000	1149000	I'm like literally tearing up.
1151000	1154000	Do you mind video game movie?
1154000	1156000	Holy crap.
1158000	1160000	No, for fuck's sake!
1160000	1162000	There's still short scenes.
1162000	1164000	And don't worry, it gets worse.
1164000	1166000	Stop.
1166000	1168000	Am I allowed to cry?
1168000	1169000	I'm like crying.
1169000	1170000	But it's okay.
1170000	1172000	I'll smile in a minute when these scenes go over
1172000	1174000	and then we can talk about the pistols
1174000	1175000	and stuff that they use,
1175000	1176000	because I like the guns.
1176000	1178000	They always use MPKs.
1178000	1180000	I don't know, I don't know.
1180000	1181000	I don't know.
1181000	1182000	I don't know.
1182000	1183000	I don't know.
1183000	1184000	I don't know.
1184000	1185000	I don't know.
1185000	1186000	I don't know.
1186000	1187000	I don't know.
1187000	1188000	I don't know.
1188000	1189000	I don't know.
1189000	1190000	I don't know.
1190000	1191000	I can't take the guns.
1191000	1193000	They always use MP5 Kifs and movies
1193000	1194000	for some reason.
1195000	1197000	Oh,
1197000	1200000	Who picked this fucking movie?
1200000	1202000	It's been like 10 seconds.
1209000	1212000	Oh yeah, pys, it's the green Goblin!
1220000	1220500	Oh.
1232360	1233020	Oh, sorry.
1235040	1238600	Oh my god, I'm actually waping away my tears. I can't handle this shit.
1238600	1239360	Ha ha!
1250800	1251800	Oh.
1252320	1255280	I can't drink my tea. Now my throat's closed up.
1255280	1258720	I don't know if you get it when you get teary, your throat closes up.
1259520	1261760	I can't freaking drink my tea.
1270920	1275680	No, wait, this is even sadder because didn't this happen to him in real life?
1276040	1279240	And he never remarried or dated anyone else?
1279240	1283240	Ah, where the fuck did I pick this? I'm in shambles right now.
1284520	1287160	I'm snot coming over now.
1288480	1289480	Oh.
1291240	1292040	Oh.
1292840	1294840	I can't even handle this.
1295800	1297800	I'm like laughing but...
1300040	1303320	Oh, I don't remember this phone being so sad.
1305160	1308120	I just need to drink my tea before it gets cold.
1309240	1311240	Oh.
1318200	1320200	Oh my god, what is it?
1320760	1323720	It better be a breather. It's good and not bad.
1324920	1327240	What breed is it? If I...
1328040	1330040	It better not be a pug.
1331880	1333080	Oh, no.
1334680	1336680	No!
1339480	1341480	Oh, wait, what?
1354520	1359480	What is that? I don't know. I don't know what kind of dog that is.
1362680	1364680	Oh.
1365400	1369400	You'll feel better once the killing starts, unironically, yes.
1372680	1377400	Okay, I'm gonna start telling you about the Makarov and then the invention of the M7-11.
1379400	1385400	And the utilities of the AK-47, why it's the most popular assault rifle crafted and created.
1385400	1387400	Oh, hi, poppers.
1389400	1391400	Oh, hi, sweet thing. Oh, it's so tiny.
1394920	1400280	Oh my god. Wait, the fact that she knew that he would need something to love on.
1401160	1403160	No, I can't fucking...
1403160	1405160	Daisy, no!
1406680	1409400	This is even worse than you could make it.
1410360	1412360	Not perfect. It's called...
1417080	1419080	Absolute shambles.
1421960	1423960	Who picked this?
1424280	1428280	Fucks sake, please tell me two isn't like this either. I can't even handle it.
1431880	1437080	Oh, we popper. No, the popper goes on the bed, you daffodil. Sorry, I don't know.
1437080	1439720	Yeah, let it on the bed right now. No!
1441480	1444760	Exactly, that's what I thought. Oh, it's so tiny and wee.
1444760	1446760	Oh.
1452280	1455480	Happily ever after fans and shambles at this movie.
1455480	1459160	Right, I'm gonna try and drink my tea without choking on it and he's stop crying.
1459880	1464680	Oh, it's like waking in a mop and stuff. Oh, he says, don't...
1464680	1466680	Daisy goes, don't rot in bed.
1467400	1469400	Oh.
1473640	1481960	Well, okay, my tea's called anger-resuming natural emotions reinstating.
1488600	1490920	Oh, it's got a wee collar and everything.
1496680	1503800	Oh, he's not got our dog food yet. Yeah. Oh my god, this movie's so real though.
1508600	1516840	Oh, look at our ee. Look at our wee floppy ears around the bowl. Oh. Sweet.
1516840	1524920	Oh my god, what a smart puppy for a film crew, honestly.
1525960	1532920	She's like, I know my spot, I'm getting my treat, I'm gonna go right here. Oh, you're so smart.
1533080	1543000	Oh, transformers. I'm fucking with you.
1547240	1551880	Filling up that gas. She said, hey, mama, let me get you a number.
1551880	1566840	They really said, put the most freaking... Obliette.
1566840	1586040	Sorry, but Russians are as they've shown us as a bad guy. It's either Chinese or Russian.
1587320	1593800	Wait, he got his willy chopped off in Game of Thrones.
1596840	1607800	See you on Greyjoy.
1613160	1621800	Not for sale. She, ooh, the girl's she, the car's a she. My little puppy.
1626920	1641640	That guy has 83 in the 86. Close enough. Same number, honestly. They both start with an eight.
1645160	1651000	Wait, is the young Greyjoy actually a previous speaker or did they just know the lines?
1651560	1657720	You'll see the Italians in a second, don't worry. Oh, okay. Right, 86 cooking.
1664440	1668120	Wait, is the puppy in the car when he's going this fast? That thing's sweet,
1668120	1669960	ears are going to be flapping in the wind.
1669960	1680920	No, look at the pup.
1700760	1712520	The truck's almost kissed.
1716200	1720920	He was using the driving as an emotional outlet for his emotions.
1720920	1730280	Hi Daisy. No, yes, finally. Dogs belong on the bed. They're so cute and they want to be a part
1730280	1737400	of the family and they want to be part of the pack. You're supposed to let dogs sleep on the bed for
1737400	1744360	you because if you don't, it means they're not a part of your pack and it hurts their feelings.
1744360	1746680	That's right, animals actually have feelings.
1752760	1755320	Hi Daisy, weezy. Oh, bleat.
1768280	1770200	Oh, fuck.
1774840	1787480	I see you.
1787480	1794480	Brrrr.
1794480	1801320	Brrrr.
1801320	1802320	Over this?
1802320	1809320	Over 69 mustang?
1809320	1816320	Holy shit.
1816320	1823320	No.
1823320	1826320	That's so sad.
1826320	1828320	What the fuck?
1828320	1833320	Did the fuck put this shit on?
1833320	1839320	No, don't touch her.
1839320	1845320	I hate it here.
1845320	1852320	Oh, what the fuck?
1852320	1857320	I can't even do that.
1857320	1862320	I can't even do that for them.
1862320	1866320	Those are such precious wee things.
1866320	1872320	No, for fuck's sake, don't call her next to her necklace.
1872320	1877320	I can't even handle this spell.
1877320	1888320	Oh my god.
1888320	1899320	Oh.
1899320	1907320	Bro.
1907320	1910320	I'm needing cuddles off your reflins after this one.
1910320	1914320	What the fuck?
1914320	1940320	I don't remember any of that, I just remember the guns.
1940320	1947320	And then in the second movie there's like a sauna scene with cool light in it.
1947320	1950320	That's all I remember.
1950320	1955320	I don't remember any of this sad shit.
1955320	1962320	I would have picked this if I knew how sad it was.
1962320	1991320	I just make my wings like a good little RuneScape player.
1991320	2000320	Hey wait, my cat.
2000320	2001320	Did I read that right?
2001320	2003320	My cat's son stole the car?
2003320	2005320	We go?
2033320	2062320	Okay, at least that guy in the suit seems to actually have some tact.
2063320	2068320	Oh my god, it is my cat.
2068320	2091320	Sad parts over our body, hope so.
2091320	2100320	Take that drink.
2100320	2104320	Shit, it's on the house.
2104320	2109320	Oh my god, it's that GT map and Grand Theft Auto IV.
2109320	2115320	And that little underbridge near the taxi depot.
2115320	2132320	Actually we should play GT4.
2132320	2137320	Oblivious.
2137320	2143320	Oblivious.
2143320	2160320	Ow.
2160320	2163320	Holy shit.
2163320	2165320	He's not happy.
2165320	2167320	Oh my god, I have tears on my blanket.
2167320	2181320	I can feel them.
2181320	2185320	Congrats.
2185320	2192320	He's got other business to attend to.
2192320	2198320	Theon's been summoned by my cat.
2198320	2202320	He's gonna go around.
2202320	2209320	You know shit is real when it's just a singular O, honestly though.
2209320	2214320	Oh pardon.
2214320	2220320	Sit down son.
2221320	2224320	Is he about to get glassed?
2224320	2242320	No.
2243320	2259320	Oh.
2259320	2288320	He's not here.
2288320	2291320	Per Theon, he always gets beaten up in his roles, honestly.
2291320	2293320	They're like, oh you're perfect for beating up.
2293320	2309320	And you're hired.
2309320	2327320	He's got a punchable face.
2327320	2335320	Shit.
2335320	2341320	Holy fuck.
2341320	2344320	Baba Yaga!
2344320	2365320	I forgot they called him the boogie man.
2365320	2389320	Phew.
2389320	2406320	Oh my god.
2406320	2409320	A hag witch, eater of men.
2409320	2420320	Okay, Baba Yaga for Gen 2 confirmed.
2420320	2433320	And yes.
2450320	2479320	Here a dead man walking.
2479320	2501320	Holy shit.
2501320	2504320	He does say Gigi literally.
2504320	2527320	He said, oh fuck he's about to bake him.
2527320	2554320	Oh shit.
2554320	2579320	He tried it's ogre for his son.
2579320	2586320	I just got tattoos for this fortune.
2586320	2604320	Fortuna.
2604320	2611320	I don't know what his back tattoos said.
2611320	2640320	Enough goes hard when he didn't say a word.
2641320	2657320	Oh.
2657320	2674320	What's happening?
2674320	2700320	He's got home advantage.
2700320	2727320	There's the layout.
2727320	2740320	No his balls.
2740320	2742320	Actually yes his balls.
2742320	2763320	Yes everything, they deserve it.
2763320	2790320	Oh my god that would be terrifying.
2790320	2819320	We don't want to hurt civilians.
2819320	2820320	One.
2820320	2837320	Don't get him involved, it's a messy clean up.
2837320	2862320	He's in on it?
2862320	2888320	Police interaction to be honest.
2888320	2914320	It's like the idea of an underworld currency that the people don't know about.
2915320	2918320	Oh clean clean clean.
2918320	2923320	Sorry waste disposals in the background.
2923320	2925320	Okay okay waste disposal.
2925320	2927320	I was like 8k 47 time?
2927320	2943320	No no cleaners cleaners.
2943320	2958320	They're just in gimp suits, it's fine it's fine.
2958320	2960320	They just like being in gimp suits.
2960320	2982320	What is harem?
2982320	2984320	Ah.
3013320	3020320	I swear that was literally me in the bag for real for real.
3020320	3021320	Your cat also talks Russian?
3021320	3037320	I know I have such a talented little cat honestly.
3037320	3038320	Thank you well.

3643320	3664320	Before she was AC she was the DJ at the continental.

3677320	3704320	Whoa.
3704320	3724320	He is scared he's pretending.
3724320	3753320	I'm having a good time I cried my eyes out.
3753320	3763320	I like when they give a chance for someone who isn't involved in the business to get out.
3763320	3766320	I can't wait for the fifth movie.
3766320	3776320	I don't even know what three or four consists of I think I've seen two but I thought this scene was in two but I think I'm mistaken.

3959320	3985320	Fuck we missed.
3985320	4003320	Fucking AC is good at this holy shit.
4003320	4032320	I suppose because of how loud clubs are there is a possibility you wouldn't hear the bullets.
4032320	4043320	Wow.
4043320	4047320	You know if you ignore all the death the club is banging.
4047320	4076320	They have no in the background AC and strongy DJ collab honestly I'd be so down.
4076320	4086320	Fuck.
4086320	4097320	No civilians remember no civilians.
4097320	4105320	I didn't know we're in Glasgow.
4105320	4115320	Go again go again.
4115320	4122320	I'm pretty sure you can get internal damage even with a bullet per vest on.
4122320	4129320	So if you guys are like oh get up John get up no like that shit is impactful as fuck.
4129320	4154320	This club's still banging I'm glad they left the music on AC is really dedicated she said
4154320	4166320	I paid for my shift I don't care what happens.
4166320	4178320	No no no no no.
4178320	4186320	I would be so winded a kid you're not.
4186320	4195320	I would be me down and out not gonna lie.
4195320	4201320	True DG let's nothing stop their set.
4201320	4210320	Oh.

4215320	4221320	Just like I'll make you swallow them.
4221320	4223320	Oh we're so fucked up.
4223320	4228320	Do they have health kits at the continental?
4228320	4230320	You have a medic?
4230320	4233320	Medic please.
4233320	4250320	Thank you.
4250320	4259320	All the pain.
4259320	4263320	Oh that was a nasty gas.
4263320	4276320	That takes time to heal.
4276320	4279320	Oh the wee ice pack on his shoulders adorable.
4279320	4298320	I've never seen those.
4299320	4306320	Bourbon is alcohol that much of a pain suppressor?
4306320	4308320	This cannot be true.
4308320	4310320	Have you been stabbed?
4310320	4317320	I think I'd rather reach for a boot profan over a wee cheeky vodka.
4317320	4319320	A nasty gas.
4319320	4321320	Oh you want to see my nasty gas.
4321320	4323320	You're making it too easy.
4323320	4327320	If you're drinking off I guess if you get bit faced.
4327320	4330320	Oh.
4330320	4335320	No.
4335320	4344320	Let this poor man rest please give him 24 hours at least.
4344320	4356320	My boss dinner's night my boss please let me keep him.
4357320	4367320	Wait.
4367320	4370320	That was a warning.
4370320	4372320	Green Goblin's still friendly?
4372320	4377320	That was a warning.
4386320	4396320	Can I say something really bad?
4396320	4413320	I like how the only way that they can go hand in hand is when he's severely damaged.
4413320	4431320	She's only equal when he's 70% dead.
4431320	4435320	Reflins you can't say that.
4435320	4438320	I can't get a clear shot.
4438320	4444320	Fucking hell she like doing maneuvers on him and stuff.
4444320	4450320	I can't even imagine the pain.
4468320	4475320	Fuck you can't see the shot at all.
4498320	4502320	Oh he's going to finish the job.
4502320	4514320	Oh you made a mistake lady.
4514320	4527320	Leave my cat out of this.
4528320	4544320	Oh color me surprised.
4544320	4556320	You're just...
4556320	4560320	Oh.
4560320	4565320	No.
4565320	4583320	Why don't we convo?
4583320	4586320	Fuck I hope they managed to close up his body.
4586320	4593320	He just got the damn stitches in place.
4593320	4596320	Yeah the director did a great job.
4596320	4599320	I kind of keep coming back to the dead in the lobby.
4599320	4602320	I like his voice.
4602320	4605320	Can I get you some bourbon?
4605320	4613320	I can't say it though I don't know how to do it but...
4613320	4617320	Oh!
4617320	4621320	You shot a holy man.
4621320	4628320	Oh he's one of them.
4628320	4641320	He really put the holes in the holy man.
4641320	4659320	And you think he won't?
4659320	4665320	Wait what gun is that?
4665320	4670320	M16?
4670320	4681320	It's not ACOG.
4681320	4684320	M4.
4684320	4688320	I was going to say M16 didn't quite look great.
4688320	4697320	I blew all the fuck.
4697320	4702320	He just helped the economy.
4702320	4704320	We love casting spells.
4704320	4706320	Shadow Wizard Money Gang.
4706320	4713320	We love burning money.
4713320	4715320	John is a refling.
4715320	4717320	He understands.
4717320	4720320	Blackrock headquarters.
4720320	4741320	He understands.
4741320	4759320	There you go free mustache wax.

4823320	4825320	I'm helping.
4825320	4845320	I'm putting down cover fire.
4845320	4847320	I'd get over there too.
4847320	4861320	I'm not going to pretend.
4861320	4866320	He goes for headshots.
4866320	4868320	Oh that was actually kind of smart.
4868320	4874320	I wouldn't have thought that myself.
4874320	4881320	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
4881320	4889320	I think we've been captured.
4889320	4904320	Come on, no, I don't like the look of this.
4904320	4932320	We're hazy as well.
4932320	4958320	I don't know, I feel like people change.
4958320	4987320	Just one comment Vigo, sorry to interrupt.
4988320	5012320	This is a battle rank.
5012320	5037320	With love.
5037320	5064320	We ain't doing the, this person died because it was in God's plan.
5064320	5093320	She was my wife.
5124320	5153320	She died because it was in God's plan.
5154320	5181320	Oh, I'm 87 let's go.

5265320	5282320	Man's tied up and still manages to, he was so pleased with himself.
5282320	5293320	See the way he licked his finger there, like yeah, yeah, I did a good job there.
5293320	5316320	Whoa, I don't recognize the shotgun.
5316320	5338320	What's going on?
5338320	5351320	Uh-uh-uh.
5368320	5384320	Oh, he's him.
5384320	5399320	Is that one of the, I don't recognize it.
5414320	5423320	Oh, he's already in.
5423320	5450320	He doesn't like being kept up in the safe house.
5450320	5461320	That actor is so good, I don't know how my cat is so good at acting.
5461320	5474320	Breh.
5474320	5480320	Can't believe I adopted a mafia cat, it all makes sense now.
5480320	5509320	It wasn't a hoarder cat's home.
5510320	5539320	I don't know how my cat is so good at acting.
5539320	5566320	A car.
5566320	5587320	It looks like the same as the other one.
5587320	5588320	It's another one!
5588320	5589320	Wait, am I being pepega?
5589320	5594320	Is that his car?
5594320	5597320	Am I being dumb and it's not the same car?
5597320	5599320	I can't tell the difference between cars.
5599320	5600320	No, it's the new one.
5600320	5611320	Okay, my apologies, my apologies.
5611320	5619320	An ally.
5619320	5630320	I thought he said something else there and I was like, oh, in this kind of movie?
5630320	5636320	Oh, please, give her a rest, woman.
5636320	5661320	Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
5661320	5676320	Oh.
5676320	5680320	No!

5830320	5857320	Oh, you're fucking done at no.
5857320	5872320	You've been a bad kitty.
5872320	5878320	Yeah, you need to get out of the country fast because this man's on you.
5878320	5879320	No!
5879320	5884320	Are we gonna walk in on his body?
5884320	5903320	No!
5903320	5909320	No, no, no.
5909320	5914320	I'm crying again. Why do I cry so much? It's supposed to be like an action game.
5914320	5918320	Why? Every friend and ally he makes.
5918320	5936320	Why can't this man have anything?
5936320	5957320	You broke the rules.
5957320	5964320	If they were all in a diagonal, point at each other?
5964320	5969320	Anyone? Anyone? If they were all in a diagonal, point at each other?
5969320	5973320	Uh, no question mark.
5973320	5986320	I'm pretty sure you can get a double kill with one bullet.
5986320	5989320	With friends like these.
5989320	5995320	With friends like these. Come on, we've still got friends in the city.
5995320	6000320	With friends like these. Come on.
6000320	6015320	We can do it, we can do it, we can do it, we can get there.
6015320	6018320	Aw.
6018320	6027320	The contrast from earlier film where it was like almost cathartic for him to be driving the car?
6027320	6039320	I mean, I guess it still is.
6039320	6043320	Hotel bro's coming clutch.
6043320	6046320	Oh, he's got his V.
6046320	6058320	He's paid his road tax. I saw that in the front of the car. It had the V paper. He's paid his road tax, lads.
6058320	6068320	Oh, he's not half him.
6068320	6083320	He said get off the road.
6083320	6088320	What is it called when a police car does a tactical takedown?
6088320	6105320	Like that, that, that, that, that.
6105320	6110320	A pit manoeuvre.
6110320	6122320	Oh my God, his senses.
6122320	6127320	It's always an oozy with a Russian.
6127320	6148320	There'd be higher pitch.
6148320	6160320	Baba Yaga.
6160320	6180320	He's fucking around, he knows he's dead.
6180320	6206320	Oh wait, we see the Matrix guy?
6206320	6213320	Ah.

6243320	6252320	Holy shit, the thunderclap of the car. I know it's raining.
6252320	6263320	No, come on, aim.
6263320	6269320	Manoeil Manoe?
6269320	6282320	Ah fuck that, I'm sorry, you're getting popped.
6282320	6286320	No.
6286320	6310320	He's like had so many drinks in his system.
6310320	6331320	Now you want to talk, now you want to talk.
6331320	6345320	I'm fucking cheating.
6345320	6355320	No.
6355320	6375320	Ah fuck, we just took organ damage though.
6375320	6393320	Please be the kidney, we have to.
6393320	6399320	Oh my God.
6399320	6410320	Is he gonna bleed out, did he get an artery on my cat?
6410320	6419320	Oh my God. He did.
6419320	6442320	Oh my God.
6442320	6464320	We did it.
6464320	6476320	He's not done? He did it, John, it's all good.
6476320	6490320	Where are you? What more business does he have?
6490320	6503320	Fuck, he can't make it to the con and then offer heals, can he?
6503320	6509320	Okay, med supply, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, go, go, stuff the wind, stuff the wind.
6509320	6513320	Pack it in, pack it in.
6513320	6523320	Oh that's gonna stink.
6523320	6535320	Oh yeah, oh my God.
6535320	6539320	We don't mean to stress you out little buddies, it's okay.
6539320	6557320	We're just visiting, we needed the med supplies.
6557320	6564320	We're going again? No. Why is this movie so sad?
6564320	6573320	No. Oh I can't fucking handle this movie, he's going again.
6573320	6583320	Even though he was so heartbroken and that's the scene where she passed away under the fucking Brooklyn bridge.
6583320	6588320	No, he has enough love in his heart to keep going.
6588320	6595320	Okay, what the fuck, these are supposed to be PMP movies.
6595320	6603320	Okay, what the fuck? Why would you read this?
6603320	6609320	Oh my God, he has enough love in his heart to keep going.
6609320	6619320	And he got a new popper.
6619320	6625320	I don't even know if I'm avoidable, what the fuck?
6625320	6630320	Okay.
6630320	6634320	Alright, hold on, if I've done this, if I've set it up right.
6634320	6640320	Is there any secret scenes in these movies? No, it's just credits.
6640320	6647320	Alright, I'll let the main credit roll. Oh my God, he has enough love in his heart to go again.
6647320	6653320	The badass music play and he looks away stronty and absolutely shambles.
6653320	6659320	Honestly.
6659320	6668320	Are you squirming me right now?
6668320	6675320	Sorry, I don't mean to make you greet at work, thank you fully legend for the tip.
6675320	6680320	Bruh, what the fuck, I don't remember any of the sad parts.
6680320	6686320	I just remember being like, haha, cool guns, okay, let's watch John Wick.
6686320	6694320	Don't I fucking regret it? Well, I don't regret it because it was a bloody good movie, but oh my God.
6694320	6698320	Right, if I've done this right.
6698320	6703320	Oh shit, okay. Does it see chapter 2 now?
6703320	6711320	Okay, hold on, wait, I need to pause so it's at the start. Does it see 2 on my thing if I've set this up right?
6711320	6717320	Which along with the t- yeah, so the movie, there shouldn't be a timestamp, but it doesn't see what the movie is?
6717320	6721320	Or does it only see what the movie is when I click play again?
6721320	6726320	Oh, I cannae handle this.
6726320	6736320	We're also watching, does it say John Wick too? Because I'm smart John Wick.
6736320	6741320	One piss. Shit, I never did that in time, hold on.
6741320	6745320	Can I change it?
6745320	6751320	I'm, hold on, it should be text, text, text, text, text, text, where's text?
6751320	6758320	Show me the text foil, where's the text file? Sorry, there's like tons of files.
6758320	6761320	Okay, hold on.
6761320	6767320	We're watching John Wick too. Okay, yeah, sorry, I don't know why I thought that was going to happen.
6767320	6773320	Take a breather? Okay, I'll take a moment. I'm going to get, I think I'll get some food.
6773320	6776320	I'm going to make another cup of tea.
6776320	6783320	That movie? Oh my gosh, that emotional turmoil in that movie.
6783320	6789320	What the heck? I don't, I think I'm such a cry baby which doesn't help at all.
6789320	6796320	Cause like, anything, like, I'm fucking crying just thinking about poor wee John.
6796320	6800320	But like, he had this happily ever after. I got yanked from him.
6800320	6803320	I got a puppy that gave him condolence. I got yanked from him.
6803320	6806320	And then he had enough love in his heart to get another puppy.
6806320	6808320	It is so sad.
6808320	6811320	Thank you Dim's doodam for the tip.
6811320	6817320	Ah, oh my god, it's a picture of a dog. I can see the tip has got a dog in it.
6817320	6821320	Literally, I can't watch any cry baby films.
6821320	6826320	Literally, this is supposed to be an action film and I'm greeting my solo.
6826320	6830320	You cried the entire movie, honestly.
6830320	6833320	I can't handle any like, things that.
6833320	6836320	So before anyone says, oh, strongy, watch up.
6836320	6842320	No, we are not watching up. I will be distraught the entire film, okay?
6842320	6850320	Ah, right, if I go get some food and a cup of tea, at least my throat won't be as closed up, okay?
6850320	6853320	Dogs are kind of a cheat code to the tear duct.
6853320	6858320	Actually, anything with like pets or like the happily ever after gets taken away.
6858320	6861320	I can't handle it. It's so sad.
6861320	6865320	But like, I'm okay. Like, I know I'm greeting my eyes out right now, but I'm okay.
6865320	6867320	I promise I'm okay.
6869320	6871320	Oh, it's just going fucking there.
6871320	6873320	Oh, right, I'm fine. I'm fine.
6873320	6876320	He got a new puppy. Life is good.
6876320	6880320	I'm sorry if I'm making anyone upset by my crying.
6881320	6886320	The feature was crying makes everyone unanimously upset. Sorry.
6886320	6890320	Oh, right, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.
6890320	6892320	It's an action movie.
6892320	6895320	Didn't we not appreciate all the guns? Oh my God.
6895320	6900320	And did you see the way they reloaded and there wasn't too many bullets in the magazines
6900320	6906320	that didn't make any sense, like some other movies, like literally every other movie that has like infinite ammo, infinite clips.
6906320	6909320	So I do appreciate the detail that went into this film.
6911320	6916320	I have to admit, they casted Big Kenny Reeves perfectly.
6916320	6919320	I can't believe they casted Makat as the freaking mafia boss.
6919320	6926320	Like, sorry, but Makat Vigo, his backstory was that he came from a hoarder home.
6926320	6930320	It wrong. He came from the Russian mafia and he has to now hide out.
6930320	6938320	He's now a fugitive in my house as I feed him nibbles and give him those lucky lick pouches that I like.
6939320	6942320	Oh my God. But that's like such a good movie.
6942320	6945320	I forgot, I completely repressed.
6945320	6952320	The only part I remembered was the bath house scene because of the light and was like nice neon.
6952320	6957320	I literally had forgotten all the other aspects of the movie.
6957320	6962320	So I don't, I am now unsure if I've actually seen John Wick 2.
6962320	6965320	I know for a fact I haven't seen 3 and 4. I didn't know they existed.
6966320	6973320	I thought I had seen 2, but I only remembered the bath house and that was in 1.
6973320	6977320	So I have a sneak in suspicion. I've actually not seen 2, 3 or 4.
6979320	6982320	So I have no idea what I'm going up against.
6982320	6985320	Who the new enemy is.
6986320	6989320	As for wines, yep, we're whining away.
6989320	6992320	I briefly got 95 cooking.
6992320	6995320	So I was at 94. Why are you guys ahead of me?
6995320	6998320	You've been playing offline without me, huh?
6998320	7002320	Bath house had some but literally I got hired, but then they, I went to a casting,
7002320	7005320	but then they denied me because I only have 9 toenails and they were like,
7005320	7007320	oh we can't cater to that.
7007320	7010320	We can't cater to that. That's disgusting.
7010320	7012320	I'm like, oh okay I guess.
7012320	7014320	Like I tried, I tried.
7014320	7016320	Sorry, I did some off-screen. No, you're not in trouble. I'm teasing.
7016320	7019320	Anyone's welcome to level up off-screen.
7019320	7023320	1 was, number 1 was 2014. 2 was 2017.
7023320	7028320	Oh, I don't, um, I, because of that bath scene in the colour scheme,
7028320	7032320	I thought that was in 2, but it wasn't.
7032320	7036320	So I actually don't know what's up ahead, I don't think.
7036320	7038320	Nothin' yell, pedicure.
7038320	7040320	Actually.
7040320	7043320	Ah, astronomy's who says the continental confirmed.
7043320	7047320	Literally, a new business, eh, we VEGO, no havin' it.
7048320	7050320	Oh, right.
7050320	7053320	And I thought it was your butt because it wouldn't fit on the camera.
7053320	7056320	Hey, I like that, I like that.
7056320	7060320	Um, right, I'm gonna take a very quick pause champ.
7060320	7063320	I'm gonna get some food. I'm gonna make a cup of tea.
7063320	7066320	I'm gonna go my little empty teacup here.
7066320	7068320	Oh.
7068320	7070320	But again, it'll be the same setup.
7070320	7072320	There'll be a timestamp for anyone that comes in.
7072320	7076320	I do apologise to any refunds that may have joined at any point and said hi,
7076320	7078320	and I was too busy crying.
7078320	7084320	I was too busy crying to be like, oh, I'm so glad you joined us.
7084320	7090320	As for who's streaming today, I don't have a singular clue.
7090320	7094320	I'm too busy, absolutely devastated over that movie.
7094320	7096320	VEGO is cooler than a mafia boss.
7096320	7100320	Literally, I'm about to commission my cat in a suit for the heck of it.
7100320	7105320	But yes, I'm gonna get a snack, I'm gonna heat up some leftovers.
7106320	7111320	I got a kebab, but I have some pasta left over.
7111320	7114320	I got a chicken kebab and it has, like, lettuce and onion in it
7114320	7116320	and a low lettuce and onion.
7116320	7117320	Red onion.
7117320	7120320	Hey, mome, can you mute RuneScape music?
7120320	7121320	Oh shit, sorry.
7121320	7125320	I actually left that in so it wasn't just, like, singular me talking.
7125320	7127320	Okay.
7127320	7129320	Okay, wait, wait, wait.
7129320	7132320	Everything's muted and I've muted in-game audio capture,
7132320	7134320	so it's literally just my voice.
7134320	7135320	That's all you're getting in the stream.
7135320	7136320	Oh, that's weird.
7136320	7138320	I mean, that's what an ASMR stream is, really.
7138320	7140320	Just give it a few more steps.
7140320	7143320	Sorry, I didn't think to do that.
7143320	7145320	Don't forget to blow your nose.
7145320	7150320	No, I'm gonna suck up all the snot to keep the nutrients inside my body.
7150320	7152320	I need every bit of hydration I've got
7152320	7155320	because I have no idea what I'm up against with these next movies.
7155320	7162320	And I swear to God, if that fucker that the Weeper Popper perishes,
7162320	7167320	I'm gonna be, I'm not even gonna be able to eat for the rest of the day
7167320	7169320	out of distress of this movie.
7169320	7170320	I swear.
7170320	7171320	Right.
7171320	7174320	Astroni can get 92 today.
7174320	7175320	She'll be halfway there.
7175320	7177320	Wow, please don't say that thing out loud.
7177320	7179320	I thought this was so much faster.
7179320	7180320	I'm ready to swap to Fletchen.
7180320	7183320	We could literally do Fletchen in four hours.
7184320	7187320	These, these wines are taking their sweet time.
7187320	7188320	Honestly.
7188320	7191320	Astroni, I thought the point of movie streams was to save your voice.
7191320	7193320	No, you need to narrate through them.
7193320	7196320	No, I'm not gonna be dead silent watching it.
7196320	7197320	Like, I'm gonna be like,
7197320	7199320	Why are this is cool?
7199320	7201320	Um, type thing.
7201320	7203320	I don't know if it was like a movie watch along
7203320	7204320	and you don't say nothing.
7204320	7207320	I feel like that's like taking the,
7207320	7209320	Yes.
7209320	7211320	Um, clutch out cooking.
7211320	7214320	You already came this far.
7214320	7216320	I asked Gimli and Vigo to help you,
7216320	7218320	but I think you need some head pads, honestly.
7218320	7220320	I wonder if Gimli's being me.
7220320	7221320	I don't at all.
7221320	7222320	I have no idea.
7222320	7224320	I like messed up my fingers so badly.
7224320	7227320	Uh, recording my Patreon audio.
7227320	7229320	I don't know if any of you are on my Patreon,
7229320	7232320	but I use my finger to do it
7232320	7234320	and I've messed up so badly.
7234320	7237320	I've got a big nasty scab on it right now
7237320	7239320	because I, I use my teeth.
7240320	7243320	I use my teeth so, my wee fingies for.
7243320	7245320	Um, the audio was good.
7245320	7246320	Like, thank you.
7246320	7249320	I was, I was jamming that thing down,
7249320	7251320	but to be honest with you.
7251320	7253320	But the problem is I have very sharp teeth.
7253320	7257320	Like, unironically,
7257320	7259320	sharp teeth.
7259320	7260320	Oh, sorry.
7260320	7261320	I need to vent your orgasm.
7261320	7264320	I forgot my microphone isn't synced for some reason,
7264320	7267320	so I'm doing vent your orgasm right now.
7267320	7269320	How are you able to hurt yourself so much?
7269320	7270320	Is that a kind of challenge?
7270320	7271320	It just, it just happens.
7271320	7273320	Literally, kind of,
7273320	7274320	Shawnee's a biter.
7274320	7276320	You want to find out?
7276320	7278320	Sharp teeth, Shawnee, honestly.
7278320	7279320	I'm a wee cuttlefish.
7279320	7282320	If you've ever seen a cuttlefish's mouth before,
7282320	7284320	or like a cephalopod's mouth,
7284320	7286320	my teeth make sense.
7286320	7289320	I, I just, I'd say finger me,
7289320	7291320	but I don't need that scab there.
7291320	7293320	Honestly, you'd probably take the scab off
7293320	7295320	from how hard you're puckering.
7295320	7297320	I'm willing to lose the tentacle.
7297320	7300320	I mean, you need sharp teeth to dig your fangs into humans
7300320	7302320	while we're in the water.
7302320	7303320	The cuttlefish attack?
7303320	7305320	I don't think cuttlefish attack, really.
7305320	7308320	I think, I think cause they're so deep seed,
7308320	7311320	it's really hard to even come across one naturally.
7311320	7314320	Remember that time that video went viral?
7314320	7317320	Cause someone who was visiting Australia
7317320	7319320	found a blue-ringed octopus
7319320	7321320	and was like touching it and playing with it.
7321320	7322320	Cause they were like,
7322320	7324320	oh, what a bright and colorful octopus.
7324320	7327320	Not knowing it's like literally 100% kill rate
7327320	7329320	if it wants to end you.
7329320	7331320	I remember that going viral
7331320	7333320	and everyone was mortified.
7333320	7336320	Just as a rule with human,
7336320	7338320	with human, with nature,
7338320	7341320	the brighter the more of a warning it is
7341320	7343320	to leave me alone.
7343320	7346320	You ever wondered why chickens are so bland in color?
7346320	7349320	Because they can hardly do a thing to you.
7349320	7351320	You want to know why tiger stripes
7351320	7353320	are such a warning sign?
7353320	7355320	Jesus.
7355320	7357320	How cute parishes did he live?
7357320	7359320	I can't remember if it was a chick
7359320	7361320	and it was a tourist
7361320	7363320	and she recorded a video of her playing with it
7363320	7365320	in the water
7365320	7367320	and it was straight up a blue-ringed octopus
7367320	7369320	and it never hurt her or anything
7369320	7371320	but if it wanted to,
7371320	7373320	so I'm going to throw up from crying so much.
7373320	7375320	I've not even had any liquid
7375320	7377320	so that burp doesn't, that burp's literally
7377320	7379320	just straight up I'm going to throw up
7379320	7381320	so upset watching John Wick.
7383320	7385320	With nature, if you don't know what it is
7385320	7387320	leave it alone, pretty much.
7387320	7389320	A ten out of ten?
7389320	7391320	I didn't even eat or anything for that.
7393320	7395320	Right, I'm going to go get some food
7395320	7397320	before we go again.
7397320	7399320	I'm going to get a cup of tea so I'll be four minutes.
7399320	7401320	I think, I don't really need to think
7401320	7403320	because I completely forgot to hydrate
7403320	7405320	and I'm dehydrating via my eyeballs right now.
7405320	7407320	I'm so...
7407320	7409320	I will hydrate when we get back.
7409320	7411320	Please, I'm going to say the S-word.
7411320	7413320	No you're not.
7413320	7415320	No you're not.
7415320	7417320	You want to know why cairns die their hair pink?
7417320	7419320	It's a warning so stop!
7419320	7421320	You can't say that stuff out loud
7421320	7423320	but why is it so true though?
7423320	7425320	Wait, hold on a minute.
7425320	7427320	Are you allowed to say it out loud
7427320	7429320	if it's the truth?
7429320	7431320	Hmm?
7431320	7433320	Now I don't mean to be a weirdo
7433320	7435320	but I'm allowed to say it out loud
7435320	7437320	if it's the truth question mark.
7437320	7439320	Yes? No?
7439320	7441320	I've got yes and a no.
7441320	7443320	Hmm.
7443320	7445320	Hmm.
7445320	7447320	Sus, sus, I don't know.
7447320	7449320	No, there's some truths that you can't speak.
7449320	7451320	Okay.
7451320	7453320	Then we will do the...
7453320	7455320	we will practice the non-speaking.
7455320	7457320	How about that?
7457320	7459320	Always speak your truth even if the world ain't right.
7459320	7461320	And they hated Strone, for she spoke the truth.
7461320	7463320	I did that meme real quick.
7465320	7467320	Honestly.
7467320	7469320	I don't know if I should say it
7469320	7471320	but we're already here.
7471320	7473320	I remember watching the YouTube channel
7473320	7475320	a couple of years back
7475320	7477320	and it was like freak out videos
7477320	7479320	of people with multi-coloured hair.
7479320	7481320	And the channel got taken down for hate
7481320	7483320	but it was just compilations
7483320	7485320	of what people had produced.
7485320	7487320	And someone was like in an atrium
7487320	7489320	swinging their arms back and forth
7489320	7491320	and it looks like they were about to fly away
7491320	7493320	but she was like screaming back and forth
7493320	7495320	with her arms. I just remember that.
7495320	7497320	Don't censor yourself, my little seaweed assassin!
7497320	7499320	Oh my god!
7499320	7501320	Assassin!
7501320	7503320	That would be my name if I was a wee assassin.
7503320	7505320	I'd be no... call me C.
7505320	7507320	Seaweed.
7507320	7509320	Why do they call you Seaweed? Oh, weed
7509320	7511320	because I'm a bit shite, to be honest.
7511320	7513320	I'm not the best. And then C because
7513320	7515320	well, the enemy kind of sees me
7515320	7517320	because I'm not very good at stealth as well.
7517320	7519320	Yeah, call me Seaweed, the assassin.
7521320	7523320	The truth is
7523320	7525320	Black Rock can't stop us now.
7525320	7527320	No, we're learning.
7527320	7529320	We're getting the information.
7529320	7531320	A danger to us even.
7531320	7533320	I was snotting the back of my nose.
7533320	7535320	You want to hear it?
7535320	7537320	Ew.
7537320	7539320	Open your mouth. That's disgusting.
7539320	7541320	I'm sorry. I just filtered one person
7541320	7543320	by doing that. I know that for a fact.
7543320	7545320	Okay.
7545320	7547320	I'm going to go make a cup of tea
7547320	7549320	and get some food. I highly
7549320	7551320	give it the hot toe.
7551320	7553320	Oh my god!
7553320	7555320	Sick GF
7555320	7557320	gives you a...
7557320	7559320	Instead of doing like her spit, she goes
7559320	7561320	like that
7561320	7563320	and then
7563320	7565320	and it's all snot.
7565320	7567320	That's disgusting. See, this is why
7567320	7569320	you can't let me come up with the ideas
7569320	7571320	and execute them because I end up
7571320	7573320	being such disgusting things.
7573320	7575320	Literally, I come out with stuff that no one
7575320	7577320	would ever think.
7577320	7579320	I legit gagged. I'm so sorry.
7579320	7581320	Disgustingly hot.
7581320	7583320	I'm so sorry. This is why you can't let
7583320	7585320	me like execute things I want
7585320	7587320	to do.
7587320	7589320	Try not to be disgusting challenge coming
7589320	7591320	up with my... No!
7591320	7593320	Try and come up with one normal ASMR idea
7593320	7595320	challenge. Literally, my first opening
7595320	7597320	line on my most recent ASMR was
7597320	7599320	the STD clinics down there.
7599320	7601320	Right, okay.
7601320	7603320	Be normal for five seconds challenge,
7603320	7605320	Ronnie. Let's go.
7605320	7607320	Right, I will be a moment.
7607320	7609320	I'll just give me a second to tingle.
7609320	7611320	I highly recommend everyone, please get
7611320	7613320	up, please get a drink, please tingle
7613320	7615320	or tingle, tingle
7615320	7617320	or please
7617320	7619320	at least stretch your legs so
7619320	7621320	you don't become absolutely clogged
7621320	7623320	like me. I think I'm already baking
7623320	7625320	a two day loaf of bread at the moment
7625320	7627320	and it's not looking good.
7627320	7629320	I'm going to have to start
7629320	7631320	sending
7631320	7633320	reeflings up there because something's not going
7633320	7635320	on. Where's Kaka and on when you need
7635320	7637320	him? He's gone far
7637320	7639320	toilet bowl and on is gone
7639320	7641320	when you needed him most.
7643320	7645320	Yeah, that first line maybe tickle.
7645320	7647320	Is this the movie marathon stream?
7647320	7649320	Yes, so we're about to do
7649320	7651320	chapter two.
7651320	7653320	We're going to start it after I go get a wee break
7653320	7655320	by a break.
7655320	7657320	I mean literally just get food to nourish
7657320	7659320	my body because I didn't eat
7659320	7661320	before stream because I don't eat before
7661320	7663320	stream because I wake up and then I stream
7663320	7665320	and then I eat.
7665320	7667320	So I'll be literally a minute
7667320	7669320	and by a minute I mean four minutes
7669320	7671320	because the kettle takes four minutes to fricking boil. I don't know why it takes so long.
7671320	7673320	I feel like my British kettle was way better
7673320	7675320	but my Aussie kettle
7675320	7677320	hooked to it.

9560760	9564760	Oh there's an enemy lady, did you catch that?
9564760	9567760	Looks like an enemy lady back there.
9567760	9573760	Normally they shy away from showing any violence against ladies in movies.
9573760	9578760	But that looked like a lady enemy in the back.
9578760	9585760	Ehh?
9585760	9590760	No, are you joking?
9590760	9595760	A fucking grenade launcher?
9595760	9599760	You have to be kidding me.
9599760	9603760	Oh my god, please tell me the dog lives.
9603760	9618760	Are you serious?
9618760	9623760	Please tell me the dog's just chilling in the kennel in the back garden.
9623760	9636760	Oh thanks.
9636760	9640760	Oh thank god!
9640760	9642760	Didn't he do that to me again?
9642760	9648760	John Wick development team and writers and all that.
9648760	9653760	The thing just chilling- oh no!
9653760	9659760	The necklace and everything is gone!
9659760	9670760	This man can't have shit!
9670760	9674760	Oh my god, at least he's got his pupper!
9674760	9677760	Holy fuck, he's becoming a monk!
9677760	9680760	He's letting go of everything he loves, fuck.
9680760	9683760	I'm trying to give it a positive twist so I don't cry.
9683760	9685760	He just wants to practice being a monk, okay?
9685760	9687760	And he's getting rid of everything he loves,
9687760	9691760	because that's the monk way or something like that, I can't remember.
9691760	9707760	Tell me?
9707760	9713760	I can't answer him.
9713760	9719760	Oh my god!
9719760	9725760	He knows he's working.
9725760	9730760	Oh look at the dog!
9730760	9732760	Okay, I finished my thingy.
9732760	9733760	Jimmy's a goat, literally.
9733760	9742760	Jimmy's like, alright, alright, alright.
9742760	9747760	Oh we went to the continent, oh!
9747760	9750760	Oh my god, that dog is constantly looking for his cue.
9750760	9751760	He's so cute!
9751760	9758760	Look at it looking at his hand for a treaty when he does the right cue.
9758760	9761760	Don't say no pets, I'll cry.
9761760	9775760	Don't say no pets, I'll actually greet.
9775760	9778760	Now the dog can come into the conversation.
9778760	9785760	It needs to know too why it's who's just got blown to smithereens legs.
9785760	9791760	Okay, what's this?
9791760	9797760	The cement didn't even have time to dry before people started picking fight skin, literally!
9797760	9812760	Okay, what's going on here?
9812760	9815760	Good afternoon, hotel owner, Mr. Winston.
9815760	9817760	Big Winnie-Billy.
9817760	9821760	Winston!
9821760	9824760	I'm having my tea, please remember to hydrate, Riflin.
9824760	9827760	If you cried like me as well during the scene a little.
9827760	9829760	I didn't cry, I may have cried a little.
9829760	9831760	But I didn't cry though, because I'm a big girl.
9855760	9861760	Dad's giving us some smack talk.
9861760	9863760	Sorry dad, we messed up.
9884760	9913760	But he was a different person back then, he's not the same big Johnny boy, he's different.
9913760	9925760	I'm a big girl, you said later me or Asa.
9925760	9932760	Okay, daddy's telling us what's up.
9932760	9937760	Okay, our options have been laid out before us.
9937760	9944760	What a smart pupper, honestly.
9944760	9950760	Can you make an exception?
9950760	9953760	Thank you! Yes, yes, yes, please!
9953760	9963760	I trust him in your hands wholeheartedly.
9963760	9967760	Aw, I trust him with the wee pupper.
9967760	9970760	I'll be back soon, don't worry.
9970760	9984760	I need to go on a badass mission against the Italians.
9984760	9988760	That's right, I'm just going to say random Italian phrases I picked up from Assassin's Creed.
9988760	9990760	What are you going to do about it?
9990760	9993760	Oh, it's the enemy lady.
9993760	9996760	Don't think, oh my god, yeah, yeah, you're feeling those pecs.
9996760	9999760	That's right, you like my pecs, don't you? Yes.
9999760	10004760	Actually, your hair's short, this might indicate a different kind of interest.
10004760	10007760	Hey, what team do you bat for? What's going on here?
10007760	10010760	Whoa, whoa, whoa, a little sheebie move right there, what the heck?
10010760	10012760	That was my back door. Back off! Back off!
10012760	10014760	You foul beast.
10014760	10016760	I have a wife, you know.
10016760	10031760	She's in either, but I'm going to her very soon.
10031760	10040760	Fucking miscoosie, that was my arsehole chick.
10040760	10055760	Accidental prostate exam whilst you're getting patted down for guns, like, or eight of them.
10055760	10066760	And yet you did.
10067760	10079760	Yeah, probably.
10079760	10091760	With a fucking pencil.
10091760	10095760	Ooh.
10095760	10115760	I should dance, huh?
10115760	10128760	Who is it?
10128760	10137760	He wants in.
10137760	10143760	Never for the Italian.
10143760	10172760	Oh, well, I mean, isn't there a reason that the father thought?
10173760	10188760	Oh, she in Roma? I'm getting flashbacks to Assassin's Creed.
10189760	10198760	To say ghost in French, you say Lufantum, repeat.
10198760	10202760	I'll correct, say a Borgia, a big chisory Borgia going on here.
10202760	10212760	Oh, she's in Rome. I love my sister, but I can't kill her.
10212760	10217760	Everyone's in their own world.
10217760	10220760	Everyone's doing their own thing, got their own problems, that was a good shot.
10220760	10228760	I like that train shot, or subway cart shot.
10228760	10257760	Mm-hmm.
10257760	10266760	Man, he really likes his Balenciaga, like, he's like, no, so I can't be the boogeyman if I've no got my nice and tidy wee shirt and shoes on.
10266760	10270760	He's got, look, he's got a method, all I'm saying, he's got a method and it works.
10270760	10283760	Oh, okay, I take it back. I apologize. That was kind of really obvious, it wasn't just clothes, I'm sorry, I'm dumb.
10283760	10290760	He doesn't want to do it, he's angry. I got scared there.
10290760	10295760	It's because he's angry, he doesn't want to do it.
10295760	10298760	That actually don't scare me, I'm gonna lie like this.
10298760	10302760	Rome, it was not built in a day.
10302760	10306760	Alright, what's the first bank we blow up?
10306760	10311760	The people cannot owe debts if there's no one to owe the debts to.
10311760	10317760	And remember, the banks are just entities at the end of the day, they are concepts.
10317760	10322760	Is that her?
10322760	10326760	I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that out loud, I'm getting a bit too carried away.
10326760	10335760	I'm sorry, John Wick's going through me, I shouldn't have said that.
10335760	10353760	So is this...
10353760	10362760	Of course it seems Julius, they didn't even try.
10362760	10370760	The YouTube transcript's probably going wild, true.
10370760	10384760	This stream is going to be a limited ads, I just know it.
10384760	10390760	No. No. No.
10390760	10398760	No, no, we're not here for the Pope.
10398760	10412760	Why would there be a head on the Pope?
10412760	10414760	Thank you.
10414760	10416760	I wonder what's inside the room.
10416760	10420760	Is there gonna be pew-pews?
10420760	10424760	God, everyone freaking knows us, we're so popular, Reflins.
10424760	10427760	How are you so popular?
10445760	10449760	You miss the word why? I mean, the Pope should be on the...
10449760	10458760	I mean, if there's religious tax exemptions, why don't the people get it?
10458760	10460760	Curious.
10460760	10462760	Do we not believe in ourselves?
10462760	10468760	Do we not have hope in ourselves? Do we not have souls?
10468760	10473760	You.
10473760	10486760	Thank you very much, Lady, for leading us to the...
10486760	10495760	How does he speak so many lingos?
10495760	10514760	Curious.
10514760	10519760	I need to do a suit measuring ASMR for you guys.
10519760	10525760	When I get down to the area, you already know I'm going to be hovering.
10525760	10540760	Oh, inseam, that's what it's called, inseam on the suit.
10540760	10543760	I need to wear wear.
10543760	10554760	All the economy and monetary traffic behind that in Italy is another way to talk about the mafia.
10554760	10559760	11.5 inches, how's anyone supposed to fit that?
10559760	10562760	Teasing.
10570760	10581760	A badass sweatshop lady, hello?
10581760	10586760	She's a trained assassin?
10586760	10596760	Yeah.
10596760	10600760	Manila and foils.
10600760	10607760	Oh, I've not seen that.
10607760	10610760	Am I?
10610760	10615760	My hands get wet at the end of an evening too.
10615760	10618760	It's just too easy, I'm sorry.
10618760	10621760	Oh my god, it's Mercy Modest!
10621760	10634760	I hate myself, I hate myself, why did I come up with that?
10634760	10637760	Next, so we fondle abysm.
10637760	10640760	Late epic joke.
10640760	10643760	Oh, sorry, my wee chair clip just came off.
10643760	10649760	Anyone else? Happy hunting.
10649760	10654760	He has a bit more tact with it.
10654760	10661760	I might need to burp a little.
10661760	10665760	Fortune's Fortuna means good luck or something.
10665760	10669760	Fortuna, bonafortuna is good luck.
10669760	10672760	What does this back tattoo say?
10672760	10674760	Someone googled it for me right now.
10674760	10679760	What does John Wicks tattoo say?
10679760	10683760	Type that in right now, go.
10683760	10686760	Something fortune, fortune favors the bold.
10686760	10689760	I knew it was fortune.
10689760	10691760	I knew it, I knew it.
10691760	10694760	Fortuna, Fortuna means fortune.
10694760	10697760	Oh, it's Latin?
10697760	10700760	Oops.
10700760	10704760	I remember my mum said she took Latin in school and I was like, ain't that lingo dead?
10704760	10711760	And I was like, well, dead spoken but or something, I don't know.
10711760	10716760	Oh look, he's gone up the cobblestones where the horsies used to clop-a-dee-clop up.
10717760	10725760	Oh, did you hear they found a new room in Pompey with blue wallpaper paint?
10725760	10727760	Like blue paint on the walls.
10727760	10729760	I'm so sorry if that's really boring.
10729760	10735760	But Pompey is the, I don't know, Ashen site of the volcanic in Italy
10735760	10738760	and they discovered a new room that used blue wall paint
10738760	10740760	and there's something about the paint that's really specific
10740760	10744760	because it got phased out in culture or something
10744760	10750760	and they don't know what the connection is with Italy having access to this blue paint.
10750760	10752760	Whoa, AC again!
10752760	10756760	Come on, AC, have you got the blue going for her?
10761760	10763760	Oh, come on, AC, take it away.
10763760	10766760	You look nothing like AC but it's close enough, close enough.
10767760	10773760	Okay, maybe AC is on the DJ stand and not the singer.
10773760	10774760	Because...
10777760	10779760	Il Colosseum.
10785760	10786760	Oh?
10787760	10790760	Target acquired.
10790760	10792760	Target acquired.
10793760	10795760	And the wise words of...
10850760	10863760	Look how low the bass player's, the guitar guy's legs were.
10863760	10866760	He was like squatting playing the guitar there.
10866760	10868760	I'm so sorry.
10870760	10873760	Italy taking a little, little ducky.
10880760	10905760	That's a man, so that ain't AC on it.
10906760	10909760	Look how low his wee legs are getting, sorry.
10909760	10911760	It looks very strange.
10911760	10915760	I think maybe because he's wearing skinny jeans, he looks like a little stick.
10916760	10919760	He looks like a praying mantis playing the guitar.
10921760	10923760	Where's wee legs going then?
10925760	10926760	Oh, I'm so sorry.
10926760	10928760	I think I'm delirious from all the crying earlier.
10928760	10932760	He's literally going to end up then just playing the guitar.
10932760	10933760	I'm so sorry.
10933760	10935760	Honestly.
10944760	10946760	I need a fur.
10951760	10953760	I almost popped a blood vessel.
10954760	10956760	Try and get that one out.
10962760	10971760	The praying mantis confirmed absolutely not.
10971760	10992760	Oh, cutthroat business women.
10992760	10994760	Maven Black Briar, clearly.
10994760	10997760	That's a Skyrim reference for you, if you want.
11008760	11010760	Oh, I'll refresh in your makeup all right.
11010760	11011760	Glup, glup, glup.
11011760	11013760	Oh, wait.
11013760	11015760	What is this little paper?
11015760	11017760	What is this little paper?
11040760	11042760	Are we in here with her?
11045760	11047760	No.
11048760	11050760	That was so cool.
11070760	11072760	I have a lot of friends.
11073760	11075760	Oh, no.
11084760	11086760	I like the way they've done subtitles.
11088760	11090760	Your brother.
11091760	11093760	You have to tell her who.
11094760	11096760	Your brother.
11101760	11104760	She knows, she knows, she knows, she knows.
11106760	11109760	Now for a seat at this table.
11109760	11111760	My way.
11111760	11113760	My way.
11136760	11138760	Yes.
11139760	11143760	She understands, no.
11152760	11155760	She's not even mad, like she understands.
11169760	11171760	We can't win.
11177760	11180760	She understands, she's not going to fight or anything.

11359760	11362760	John, she asked to go pretty.
11362760	11364760	That's why she did that.
11364760	11367760	She didn't want a big blast on her freaking cranium.
11371760	11374760	For fuck's sake, men don't understand.
11375760	11379760	She wanted to be a pretty corpse on her own terms for fuck's sake, John.
11380760	11383760	AC, you better turn them tunes down, I'm region.
11385760	11387760	John, you dance.
11387760	11389760	Oh, no.

11392760	11394760	Ah.
11407760	11410760	Oh, she didn't know.
11410760	11412760	Good night.
11423760	11425760	Oh.
11441760	11444760	She did get to go out on her own way.
11444760	11447760	I know John has to confirm the job, but...
11448760	11450760	Oh, I guess team is of the essence.
11450760	11452760	You can't be messing around.
11453760	11455760	Fucking AC, get it.
11461760	11463760	On stage?
11463760	11466760	Wait, they think it's a plot?
11466760	11468760	Like a...
11469760	11471760	Okay, okay.
11471760	11475760	Uh, high civilian casually, right?
11501760	11503760	What?
11509760	11511760	What?
11519760	11522760	A good blood detail on the kills.
11532760	11534760	Yeah.
11539760	11541760	Oh, she's gone.
11544760	11547760	Damn, they must have had to edit the Krammer crew out of that mirror shot.
11547760	11549760	I just...
11556760	11558760	Oh, it hurts.
11558760	11561760	A bullet just dropped off of him, that's actually such a good detail.
11561760	11564760	I wouldn't even consider that, but yeah, if a bullet gets stopped,
11564760	11567760	it could just be attached to the core of him.
11575760	11577760	I think we just got the patchy.
11577760	11581760	I'll actually just pop him off like a bit ASMR,
11581760	11586760	but like bullets like popping off of a bullet thing.
11588760	11592760	Well, I can't even see shit, I don't even know about you, lads, but...
11592760	11595760	Fuck it, I'll need my glicks on for this scene.
11595760	11597760	It's a bit cloudy.
11599760	11601760	It's the lady.
11611760	11614760	He double-crossed us?
11619760	11622760	We were double-crossed?
11626760	11629760	Well, now we can't let him take the throne at all.
11629760	11632760	He is not getting a seat at the high table.
11632760	11636760	If anything, I'll take over for the Italians myself.

15967880	15976040	We have been excommunicadoed and now all assassins worldwide have a 14 million
15976920	15978920	us dollar
15978920	15980040	bounty
15980040	15986280	On the head of beloved john wick or it also known as refling also known as me because

16000760	16007320	Your horrendous fight in the why is it called a restroom if I'm fighting for my life in here?
16009800	16011480	Okay

16037000	16044040	No, thank you so much for the stream because I just get to fucking goof off and edge myself and edgeville with wines
16044600	16046760	I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that part out loud
16047160	16048760	um
16048760	16056200	I'm starting to lose the filter slightly. I I think because of the emotional turmoil that was the first, um
16057320	16062520	Movie I have to admit. I did not recall any of those sad scenes
16063400	16064520	and
16064520	16071160	I only cried a little bit in the second one. So surely by the third movie. I'm not shedding any tears
16071720	16076520	Surely there shall be no tears shed. I'm a big girl. Okay
16077480	16082920	Um, I have two hours 10 minutes and 46 seconds. You can actually see it up top
16083000	16085800	It's loaded one second in how cheeky of this

19882940	19887020	Think that dog got confused it's supposed to go in the same window as the other one, but it's fine. It's fine
19889020	19892700	Even up a tree can't save you from your boss getting bitten off honestly
19894300	19898700	Right, so are we unironically going on a constellation quest?
19903180	19912940	You tell me the elder of the high table is sitting about in the desert
19917580	19922540	Just hanging around the back satellite surveillance can't even find them
19925500	19927500	There you go poppers
19933260	19935260	Oh
19946780	19948780	Are you sure about that?
19950700	19954940	Oh, what bird tonight is tetanus, sorry the other one

19962700	19966700	Know the three fly on his suit I saw that don't think I didn't notice the fly on his suit
19968220	19971180	It's sucking up all them the moisture off of you every fun
19982220	19984220	Really
19990060	19992060	You
19995020	19997020	Really
20009180	20014060	Really did we not just save her daughter and hide her and keep her safe
20014860	20016860	Oh
20017420	20020620	My god, we actually are just going on a random desert quest
20021260	20023820	My brother you are going to perish so quickly
20024940	20030460	And no drinking your pee in the desert doesn't work. You're filtering out urea, which is the
20031180	20034940	Like basically the straight poison your body can't handle it is why it's a byproduct
20035980	20037980	so no
20038380	20040380	Better drink your own
20040700	20042700	doesn't work
20042700	20046060	And at night in the desert I get sub below temperatures
20050620	20054540	Oh my god, there's gonna be a sandworm for dune coming out of nowhere in a minute
20061260	20063260	Okay
20063980	20067500	Well, this is where the quest ends clearly because we've just perished
20069260	20071260	Mummy can you do that too? Oh
20072780	20075180	You may spit water out and make you drink it
20077500	20079500	Seven days

20085980	20087340	No
20087340	20093340	Oh my god, right saws, but the yakuza is taking the mic. This is a soup kitchen
20095100	20100380	We feed the homeless fur just a human right shock and behavior honestly
20103340	20110540	Wait, is he is he gonna die? No, no, no, no, no, no wait, is Winston gonna die as well?
20113260	20115260	Oh my gosh

23431900	23435500	Oh my god, we're doing it. Yeah
23439740	23444460	John's becoming a real reflin type of put down the high table wink wink
23445180	23448700	Okay, that's gonna be our codename the high table
23450540	23452540	I'm real
23455420	23459260	Oh my goodness, ah, I'm loving this
23461580	23464860	Oh my god, are you to and we in part five isn't even out
23466220	23468940	But we're gonna have to watch part four. We have part four now
23469900	23473900	Healyberry wait, isn't Healyberry an X-Men?
23477420	23480060	John wakers against the world

23489580	23494940	Oh, she is she is she is oh my god. We're going against the high table replays
23495500	23499660	Yatta, she was the Casablanca lady
23502780	23509900	Oh my gosh, we're doing it. We're doing it. Oh my gosh
23513820	23516380	Okay, let me change it the title to four
23517500	23519500	And then we'll get a quick break
23520060	23522060	So I can
23523020	23526060	Uh, right pause and then go next one
23527900	23529900	You know like next
23530060	23532060	That's it and pause
23532940	23536940	Does that display? Yep, it does. What? How long is this movie?
23540460	23543660	Okay, I'm going to heavily recommend
23544300	23548700	Um, everyone get a snack and a stretch and a toilet and a
23549020	23552300	Yes, uh, I did not realize
23553500	23555900	How long this one is
23558220	23563580	So maybe chapter five doesn't play off of four because this is so long
23564780	23567500	Maybe we do all of the high table in one go
23568300	23571900	Because for a three-hour movie, I feel like you can take out a lot of
23572940	23577740	First the lady in the cloak the cloak goes first surely surely
23579340	23585100	Well, what do we do about Winston? Do we understand that Winston didn't actually want to kill us?
23585100	23591260	Or was he forced to? Is he still an ally? I'm not really sure what because he wasn't like
23591260	23596700	Oh, yes, I will destroy John Wick right now. So I'm a bit uh, a bit curious about
23597980	23603820	What Winston's arc is I keep bringing out those gloves, but I'm not trying to do a boxing match
23604780	23607740	Uh, right, we're gonna find out we're gonna find out no spoilers
23607740	23613980	Please the only time I ask for no hand-holding and no spoilers is we're gonna watch John Wick 4
23614380	23619660	And I've never seen it. Uh, I don't think I saw it there. I don't really recall any of that
23619980	23623100	I'm so glad the concierge got a little bit of a scene
23623660	23627580	Um, I wish there was a bit more badassery coming from him
23627660	23635900	I feel like the concierge is like the the doting kind of gentle until it's like time to call in the arms
23636460	23638460	like that kind of thing
23639260	23640860	um
23640860	23645180	He shot my bulletproof vest, so I don't know if he meant to keep him alive
23645740	23647900	I feel like he would have known he was alive
23647980	23651580	But like y'all didn't put like a little crash mat down there for him
23651980	23655740	You know, you could have could have moved it away by the time she went down the elevator
23655740	23661180	And that's all I'm saying. Okay, the lift takes you know, I'm not saying you've got the fastest lifts in the continental
23661260	23666540	But a little crash mat wouldn't have gone amiss. Uh, definitely would have helped out. Um
23668380	23670380	But hey ho
23670380	23675660	We are alive reefing willing is alive and reefing has been sent into take down the high table
23675740	23679660	Which I'm very curious to see how this goes. Um, I also didn't mention
23680700	23684140	We're officially in the 30 thousands for our wanes
23684540	23686940	um, I believe a
23687500	23695100	A lovely reefing has done the maths and they said that my wanes in my bank if I do them
23695180	23696780	I am 99
23696780	23700220	uh, we are at 36,000 so
23701580	23702620	They're
23702620	23704620	Maybe if I can get it down to
23705260	23707260	20,000
23708460	23710620	Oh, I don't know if I have time for 20,000
23711020	23715980	Maybe then tomorrow's endurance stream. We might actually do it
23717100	23724620	Um, what level of cooking am I now? I am 90 um 100 xp off of 91
23726300	23731500	Um, but we are cooking by gas. We're getting there. We're getting close

23772540	23775340	I don't know if anyone was called sam, but we watched um
23776540	23777660	Um

24293580	24294620	Wow
24294620	24300140	Thank you. Doomsday damn for the tip and do lay lover via lure for the five
24300780	24304060	Would you do another members karaoke stream? Absolutely. Yes. Um
24305420	24307420	I think I have like
24308460	24313260	I actually don't think it'll be a problem all from my voice because I've already worked it to be honest
24314060	24316060	the what right so
24316540	24320140	I've permanently damaged my voice, which is fine. It's not a big deal
24320780	24322780	but the actual
24323580	24325580	The actual
24325900	24327900	positive of it is that
24328700	24333180	I can keep going now if that makes sense now that is damaged like I can keep going
24334540	24341180	And the damage was just singing which doesn't really make much of a difference to me because I don't like I don't have an interest like
24341580	24348060	Some vtubers like absolutely have like a full interest in singing for me personally. I couldn't give less about
24349020	24351020	Um
24351340	24354620	Mum is back. Yes. Oh no the runescape. Yeah
24355500	24358060	Still down runescape. You're stuck with me
24359100	24364460	Um, right. I've got a cup of sorry. You didn't see that. I've got a cup of tea
24365340	24371900	Um, I actually didn't see any snacks that I was interested in so I literally have tea cola and water
24372220	24373580	um
24373580	24378940	To last me through these three hours. I keep forgetting to boil new eggs so I can just grab them for stream
24379020	24379740	but
24379740	24384060	It's fine. It's fine. Um as for tomorrow's stream
24386140	24389260	It's a 50 50 if it gets changed for something else
24389340	24393420	I don't know if I can do two back-to-back endurance streams without absolutely annihilating my health
24393500	24395500	I'll see what kind of sleep I get
24395740	24402380	But I'm just warning you now. I don't know if we're gonna be able to finish off the wines tomorrow. Um
24403260	24405340	because I might be
24405900	24407900	um
24407900	24413740	Just doing something smaller because I've got a few things to do for the girls. Um, they've been absolutely fantastic. So the
24415020	24419420	The editors that work for veal were um, they're getting put to work
24419500	24421500	We're gonna see what the kind of price return
24422060	24424060	Etc is and then
24424780	24428380	Yeah, don't be surprised if you see a hell of a lot more consist
24428860	24433100	Short consistency now that the the dust is settled. Um
24433900	24437900	We currently have four clippers. I have my own personal clip editor
24438380	24444700	Um, but I might hit get her to do some her names are rissa. Hi rissa. I doubt your your but
24445100	24450380	Um, she's such a nerd. She plays dnd and she's like oh my dnd cancelled
24450460	24453420	I can do some more editing for you and I'm like, oh, that's so adorable
24453580	24456220	Are you sure you want to like not take the day off or whatever?
24456780	24463340	But um, yeah, rissa's really cool. I like her. Um, and she's Australian. So it makes me even cooler. Um
24464380	24469580	I might I'm gonna see if I can get one more clipper on board. Um
24471340	24473340	Cause
24474060	24477420	Uh, I'm starting to want to get highlight reels of the girls
24478780	24481420	And shorts coming out a bit more consistently
24481660	24487020	I'm gonna aim for three shorts per week and see how that works out because obviously
24487580	24491820	You guys have been fantastic clipping the girls. By the way, I see sent me
24492220	24498620	I like instructed the girls on how to how to show me the clips that they want turned into a short on youtube
24499100	24504300	And I see came through she was like scrawny. I'm so sorry for all this
24504540	24508300	I like do not be silly. You have literally like saved me so much time
24508380	24515100	You've given me such high quality clips. Like don't be silly. So thank you special. Thank you to literally anyone who is
24515340	24517340	mucking about clipping
24517740	24525580	Like any funny ha ha's of any of the girls you help out so much with these shorts that we're gonna start making and posting and all that jazz
24525900	24527900	like mercy, um
24528300	24532860	Had like a hilarious short. I don't know if you've seen it. Oh, sorry. My cats are going nuts. Um
24533820	24536300	I just fed them. So they're probably going to actually not
24537020	24539020	Breaking my door. Um
24539260	24541420	Mercy had this like hilarious short
24542220	24546620	Someone asked her like, oh, are you going to do a cooking stream? And she told the story about a time
24546860	24552620	She freaking was cutting upside down with a knife and I'm like, oh my god
24553660	24557580	I thought like I thought we were kind of memeing that mercy is like the pawn one
24557980	24560540	No, mercy is the pawn one
24561020	24566140	Like it was the most it was the funniest short I've ever seen in ages. I absolutely adore it. So don't be afraid to like
24566940	24573020	I think if you click subscriptions, you can like scroll down like two and then it shows like shorts of who you're subscribed to
24573100	24576940	So don't be afraid to like look at whatever the girls are like posting if you've subscribed to us all
24577340	24581500	Which I know you have subscribed to us all haven't you?
24582620	24584620	Yes, good
24585580	24591580	Let's see if you want to get 99 crafting at some point the typical trading method is minus 30 million
24591660	24593660	I wonder what the time is in crafting up
24594140	24600860	I'm getting addicted a little bit to runescape, but not as addicted to balochro balochro. Uh, yes. Yes. Good. That's all I'd hear
24601340	24602940	I demand
24602940	24604940	unification, okay
24605180	24608460	That's funny. Like bro the pawn levels are so high upside down now
24608620	24613740	Literally a yandere that doesn't know how to night hold a knife properly is the funniest story
24613820	24615820	I think I've ever fucking heard in my life
24616060	24622140	Um, and it was edited so well like that editor like was above and beyond he does fantastic. Um
24623420	24627580	40 hours. Oh shit. How much is cooking? How many hours have I put into cooking?
24627980	24631580	Well, the first stream didn't count because I was getting distracted mucking about with you
24631980	24635580	We were doing questing so the first runescape stream doesn't actually count
24636540	24637740	Um
24637740	24641260	I wasn't able to clip yesterday stream. No, no, no, don't worry. Don't worry if you can't do it
24641260	24647260	But like for any like literally for anyone who goes back and is like, oh that moment made me blow air out of my nose
24647260	24653820	A little bit faster. Hmm. It helps out so much. It really does. Uh, azer gave me a bunch as well. I am gonna
24655420	24660700	Um, see if I can get some going for sheebie. I was having problems with sheebie shorts. Um,
24661260	24665820	I think I mentioned this the other day. She's so boobalicious that um
24666700	24672940	YouTube basically limited pretty much everything which sucked. Um
24673740	24678300	I couldn't put advertise like you can put youtube ads to like make her
24679020	24683260	Like their shorts show up in the algorithm more, but because she'd be so boobalicious
24683260	24689980	I wasn't having it. Although Azura's it let through and I'm like, I think we can all agree. Azura's got bigger oranges than
24690540	24694700	Sheepsters, so I'm not really sure how they determine it one minute
24694700	24698300	They're discriminating against Azura the next minute. They're like, ah, that's fine
24698940	24702380	Cookin's 30 hours. Why am I taking so long then honestly?
24703980	24708380	I find I tend to clip a lot more when watching vods. Yes, especially
24708380	24714140	Thank you to any vod watchers that like go back and clip or timestamp like funny moments as well
24714220	24721020	I am able to see that on my end. Um, but I have asked the girls to take on that responsibility because uh
24721580	24725420	If you didn't know most VTuber agencies don't
24725980	24731100	Actually create like thumbnails or they tell their girls to like make shorts
24731660	24736460	Themselves or out of pocket and I'm like no if you guys just give me the clip
24736540	24740300	I'll send it off to a clipper and pay for that and then I'll pay for promotion as well like
24740940	24742220	um
24742220	24747980	It's quite outrageous what some of these VTuber agencies ask of their talent in my opinion
24748060	24751980	But and that's just how it is. So hopefully over time things can change like, um
24753180	24758780	Sock VTuber agency looks like it's going to be different, which I'm very happy and excited about um
24759820	24761420	I
24761420	24762540	um
24762540	24767660	I'm very happy to see the rise of new agencies and learn the behind the scenes. Um
24768380	24773260	Obviously, we've been incredibly friendly with the yumi plus girls and the behind the scenes
24773260	24775740	I got to learn a bit more about them and I am
24776300	24781900	Uh, very happy with the direction they're going. So I'm happy to obviously muck about with them. Um
24782860	24790540	And hopefully the girls find prosperity under prosperity prosperity prosperity not prosperity
24790620	24796860	I think that's a different word. Uh prosperity, uh, pros the good one the good one live long and prosper that one
24797580	24804380	I yes live long and prosper for the girls and um, I'm very excited for what the future holds for yumi plus. Um
24805020	24809740	I do genuinely think these kinds of VTuber agencies, uh
24810700	24812380	definitely
24812380	24813980	more of a
24813980	24815180	What's
24815180	24819660	More of a more and poor vibe. I think is very nice
24820300	24826060	Is posterity boobs or something? I don't know as there has more but there's more ropes on yeah
24826860	24829500	I mean it pays for itself investment is visibility
24830300	24831500	Um
24831500	24837980	Yes, and no the reason I say no is because the books haven't been done for the first month of peeler yet
24838300	24844780	And I don't know if I've I've spent like way much in like advertising watch along. There's a few hidden things as well
24844780	24846140	That was paid for
24846140	24851180	Um, the shorts are being paid for so I need to do I need the books to be done
24851260	24853820	I don't do the books because obviously I'm number dyslexic
24854220	24859900	Um, I'm waiting on the bookkeeper to do their part once the first of july rolls around
24860300	24863580	And then I'll be able to see what the agency earned
24864300	24871580	And then that means I can maybe talk about my donathon goals. We're a bit far away. We're still
24872220	24876620	We're still not even clear. We're you know, october's my donathon
24876620	24882140	But as I said, my donathon is related to the agency. It's not related for myself
24882460	24891740	Whereas the girls donathons are related to potentially moving out or doing more content or having the availability to do certain things. Um
24893900	24897820	Posterior is your rear. Wait put posterior
24898540	24900380	Why is that?
24900380	24901900	Why is that?
24901900	24905340	Oh, we're also gonna have to watch monty python at one point
24907020	24910060	And before actually we ran out of money collapse. Oh, no, I
24911020	24914220	For me personally, um from what I've seen
24915100	24918060	No, the company is not running out of money. Uh
24919020	24920460	I
24920460	24927020	When it comes to ROI, which is return on investment. Uh, yeah, let's just say I'm no worries
24928140	24931980	You guys have been incredibly supportive incredibly generous
24932220	24939580	Um, the patreons are popping off the merchandise. Thank you for anyone that buys from uwu market because that
24940140	24942940	profit margins all go to the talent. It is the we
24943580	24948620	We vealor do not get cut. We it doesn't even go through our hands. They own like the accounts and everything
24949180	24950700	um
24950700	24953500	And we hopefully have some very exciting news soon to him. Uh
24954700	24959180	Posterior meaning behind posterity meaning past. Well, I got it completely wrong
24959260	24965820	Yes, we're gonna watch the life of brian because you freaking fanies keep taunting me with fondle of bism
24966380	24970700	And it's like, is there something wrong with the way I say
24971500	24973500	fondle of bism
24974860	24977820	She has a what she has a yandere, you know
24979100	24980860	karam
24980860	24982700	Karambit
24982700	24989580	Basically is how that's gonna go. Um, so you guys are so done when we watch that together. Um, absolutely done
24990300	24993820	Um, because Lucas is fondle of bism
24993820	24999100	Look, it was a good name. It wasn't a bad name. I actually like the name
25000220	25003180	I don't know. Maybe I'll I'll get her to have a halloween outfit
25003740	25007500	um, and then like she has a tag on her head that says fondle of bism
25008620	25010220	and
25010220	25013340	Just as long as we don't watch the holy grail. Wait, what's wrong with the holy grail?
25013980	25015980	Have I seen that? I think I've seen
25016860	25018540	life of brian

25070060	25072460	Remember that time I clipped mercy not whistling
25073020	25079020	Remember that time I'm getting a short produced of mercy of being unable to whistle
25082300	25084300	It's coming out soon

27226380	27233180	I really hope this enemy is defeated quickly because the gimmick is pretty bad
27235180	27238700	I know that's not nice, but that gimmick is a bit too strong
27240140	27242140	I hope he perishes quickly
27243340	27245580	I swear if he makes it through the three hours
27247820	27249820	Like I get it don't get me wrong

27261820	27263820	I really enjoyed
27265820	27268380	The other concepts they put forward, but this is a bit
27271020	27275900	Like the old sensey thing she hates the school of blind fury. Wait, is that a movie or something?
27276780	27278780	Bro, he's literally using the force
27280460	27283580	Okay, I like the ding dong aid assists, but

27360540	27363500	like a lot of those who are diagnosed with it still have some sort of like
27363980	27365660	light
27365660	27367660	perspective and
27367660	27369260	and
27369340	27374780	Extreme prescription that kind of thing. It's not necessarily like straight up knee nothing going on at all
27375980	27377980	So yeah, just thought you should know
27378860	27380860	There's also degenerative um

27717900	27720940	Don't do the fancy whipping around it's not that hard to not get hit
27721340	27723900	I don't know. I feel like I'd be like that with a whip as well
27723980	27726780	Like those kind of weapons that can horribly backfire
27727020	27731740	I'd probably have like the worst scar on my face after whipping the crap out of myself
27732700	27734700	And because whip scars don't heal
27755900	27759180	Just a simple swinging trapping it under your arm against
27759820	27762300	Requires a high dexterity score

28086540	28088540	I
28095900	28099660	I'm starting to understand why this movie is three hours long. I think we've legit had no
28101900	28106300	Fucking plot for like the last 30 minutes it's all been fighting
28108940	28110940	Hey

28160940	28167260	What he just wants the bounty until it's bigger and then he can disappear
28173980	28175980	Yeah, damn

28251420	28253420	Modes take this man's dry row away
28254380	28257900	Actually about one person probably understood that reference
28260140	28265660	Dry row is the disability paycheck you get if you're legally like disabled or the the doctor
28266300	28269260	Deems you unfit for work. So that was a very poor joke, but
28271820	28277260	I just want this guy gone. I don't like the plot surrounding him. I don't I'm sorry. I said it
28278220	28280300	Please John Wick pop out of the water and just
28281100	28283100	And let it be done

28313420	28315420	You
28343980	28345980	You
28354140	28356140	All right, I was most stomach as you heard that

28381340	28383340	Is he not bleeding out
28387100	28389100	What I don't understand
28395020	28397020	Wait so he could have survived the injuries
28397260	28403980	And he was gonna leave the daughter alone
28415660	28419900	I'm not even crying from upset. I am getting frustrated now
28423820	28425820	Uh
28425900	28430860	Can we can can we get timestamp when blind man die dies
28444060	28449180	I'm gonna say the script rewires are definitely different in this bloody movie because the
28450540	28453740	The vibe and the change is
28456780	28458780	So
28467180	28471260	Well, it seems like she's gonna get him at least later date
28478620	28479820	Wrap it up
28480460	28482380	I'm not spoiling it
28482380	28488060	That last indication and the shot made it seem like she will be the reason the man perishes at least
28488620	28495020	So my i'm allowed to predict or is that really annoying if the person predicts a street like the how the movie's gonna go
28496220	28499020	I'm uh, yes to predictions or no to predictions
28499980	28501980	You
28507740	28509740	Can always predict okay, just don't answer
28510300	28513260	Because of that last shot being like i'll be waiting for you
28514300	28520540	What's gonna happen is wait, wait, wait, they're actually becoming a jewel stop. I guess that the star
28521260	28523260	I
28525020	28530140	Was gonna say she'll slip in just as he's about to lose the fight and perish the blind man

30636260	30642260	Yay, 92. Did they just get married? Something like that.
30645260	30648260	Don't try this at home folks, no definitely not.
30648260	30650260	Level 92.
30653260	30660260	You're challenged.
30668260	30674260	Winston is gonna be your nominee.
30675260	30680260	Don't remind me, Emmy.
30683260	30688260	I mean, we're at 33,000 jugs, honestly we're getting there.
30688260	30695260	We really got 45,000 or something at the start, like we're gonna be in the 20s I think.
30698260	30700260	You're welcome, LeMau.
30701260	30704260	And game, Emmy.
30706260	30708260	It's not the real Emmy.
30713260	30716260	You're peeing as my daughter, are you?
30723260	30725260	Hmm.
30731260	30733260	Hmm.
30737260	30741260	You're coping with a two week vacation.
30741260	30743260	Hmm.
30761260	30765260	Exactly, we have to deal with it.
30772260	30774260	Hmm.
30784260	30786260	Lance, who's Lance?
30788260	30790260	Winston is Lance?
30792260	30794260	Or Concierge is Lance?
30801260	30813260	Oh, yeah, yeah, Concierge is. Sorry.
30831260	30833260	Hmm.
30841260	30843260	Hmm.
30843260	30845260	Hmm.
30857260	30860260	They're fun to the bosoms, right?
30873260	30875260	Hmm.
30894260	30897260	There it is, one man do it.
30903260	30905260	Hmm.
30916260	30918260	What?
30918260	30920260	Hmm.
30932260	30936260	I'll take my odds with Baba Yaga, I'm gonna be honest.
30940260	30942260	Hmm.
30943260	30946260	Winston is happy with the terms.
30949260	30951260	Hmm.
30953260	30957260	Important, Meaton, Ethel Turd in the background.
30958260	30961260	I'll take those odds, yeah, I'm with you there.
30967260	30969260	Nice and fresh.
30970260	30973260	And I'm with the Triple Lusky.
30974260	30976260	Hmm.
30977260	30983260	Wait, it's a card, wait, Winston the Jewel, I thought it meant of combat, hold on a minute.
30989260	30992260	It's a game of chance of chords?
30993260	30998260	I thought it was physical combat, that's why I picked Baba Yaga.
31003260	31005260	Hmm.
31024260	31026260	What?
31033260	31045260	Oh, they're picking and whoever has the highest number gets their choice.
31045260	31047260	So is it combat?
31057260	31059260	Blades.
31064260	31066260	Pistolate.
31067260	31069260	Ooh.
31084260	31087260	Right, just paw of greed.
31088260	31094260	Oh, cause you never change right, we get it, fourth installment.
31094260	31099260	Ray, we get it, wrap it up, wrap it up, we get it, John Wick never changes, wrap it up.
31099260	31102260	This is a fourth film in a row.
31102260	31104260	Wrap it up.
31104260	31106260	Ah.
31115260	31117260	Four, why never changes?
31127260	31129260	No quarter.
31134260	31136260	Cain.
31144260	31146260	Okay.
31149260	31152260	I guess we aren't on an ally streak.
31164260	31166260	Okay.
31194260	31196260	Okay.
31225260	31227260	Yes.
31236260	31240260	He just wants to play Hotel Simulator, leave him be.
31255260	31260260	Not like this.
31271260	31281260	Unless, unless last minute we kill him, I don't know.
31285260	31290260	In life last minute we kill him, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
31292260	31294260	Oh, I don't know.
31294260	31297260	I don't know how this film's gonna end.
31297260	31303260	I originally thought we were literally going around the high table, getting all seven and going for it.
31303260	31306260	But obviously that's not how you're supposed to do it.
31306260	31307260	Pardon me.
31307260	31309260	He wants to revive Havel Hotel.
31309260	31312260	Apparently they came out with Old Havel Hotel.
31312260	31315260	And everyone was like, yeah, you see it groomed on that website?
31315260	31319260	Which is actually shot on, to be honest.
31330260	31334260	Lighting a candle for our wife, Helen.
31339260	31341260	Okay.
31369260	31371260	Um.
31380260	31382260	Kill's closed.
31399260	31401260	No.
31429260	31431260	Okay.
31431260	31433260	Okay.
31455260	31458260	I urge you to reconsider.
31461260	31463260	Yeah.
31474260	31476260	I miss you too, buddy.
31482260	31484260	Goodbye, King.
31492260	31498260	Uh, level 92.
31500260	31506260	We're getting almost to 20,000 left over grapes and wine, so we're getting there.
31521260	31523260	Okay.
31546260	31549260	He says such ominous stuff.
31549260	31553260	It's almost like that old man's not written for him, even though...
31563260	31565260	Bonsoir.
31565260	31567260	Salut. Bonsoir.
31567260	31569260	Bonsoir.
31577260	31579260	Merci.
31579260	31581260	Merci. Bonsoir.
31585260	31587260	Excuse-moi.
31587260	31591260	Where is the man?
31592260	31595260	That's how he does bro.
31595260	31600260	Honestly, I feel like that old guy doesn't actually like the new kid.
31600260	31603260	Like he wants the old ways.
31603260	31605260	Bonsoir.
31623260	31625260	Bonsoir.
31627260	31629260	Salut.
31634260	31636260	Salut.
31649260	31651260	Where is he?
31664260	31667260	Uh, any devours?
31667260	31669260	Nope.
31669260	31672260	He's got the glares- whoa, what's this?
31674260	31676260	The math of the city?
31693260	31705260	Uh, uh, he's wrong about that.
31711260	31718260	Okay, maybe the blind man has more cars, but John Wick wants to kill so he can keep the memory of his wife, okay?
31718260	31721260	So you're not correct, technically.
31721260	31723260	Stinky Frenchman.
31723260	31725260	P.E.U., go take a bath.
31725260	31727260	You know?
31727260	31733260	Put some odour toilet on, mate. You're absolutely giving me the book.
31733260	31739260	Are we having a battle on the Eiffel Tower? On the big Eiffel Tower?
31739260	31742260	Oh, inside the tower?
31742260	31745260	Seek and destroy?
31745260	31747260	Oh.
31751260	31755260	We are making the high table sweat, holy crap.
31781260	31785260	Hired for Gen 2 confirmed.
31812260	31814260	P.E.U., go take a bath.
31814260	31840660	That's called Psychological Warfare.
31840660	31866260	Incinerate Armour?
31866260	31894180	The movie's thrown me, I can't predict what's going to happen, it's all going to be over
31894180	31924020	in an hour, then we're going to know.
31924740	31946820	Fiberoptic internet on that thing, that thing does not hold 21 bills, I can tell you that
31947140	31963300	right now, how few words does he actually say in this plot, he's using a heartbeat sensor, cheater,
31963300	31969860	cheater, cheater, pumpkin ear, no we're taking a romantic stroll on the river, sea, was it
31970580	31975460	sea air, sorry sea air, that's the accent on,
31978660	31981300	I was a bit late for that, oh
31992100	31993300	Mr. Concierge
32000820	32006820	mm
32023140	32025940	white right
32029860	32036860	Good bye and good luck, Mr. Wick.
32036860	32043860	Mon chance.
32043860	32054860	No miss you.
32054860	32068860	I'm not going to cry.
32068860	32069860	Too frustrated.
32069860	32070860	I'm not going to cry.
32070860	32072860	Because I have no idea where this film is going.
32072860	32074860	But I'm not going to cry.
32074860	32087860	That was very sweet.
32087860	32110860	No no, no cry, no cry.
32110860	32118860	Wait, so how are they allowed to still go from even though he has a fight with a high table?
32118860	32147860	All fades are black.
32147860	32172860	I'm not going to cry.
32172860	32199860	I'm not going to cry.
32199860	32224860	I'm not going to cry.
32224860	32226860	I'm level 96 now, strongy.
32226860	32232860	Give me your account right now.
32232860	32243860	Just a few more levels.
32243860	32247860	Oh, they're actually thinking about shutting down the traffic because it's so bad here.
32247860	32249860	Yes, mummy, here's my account.
32249860	32253860	Stop.
32253860	32259860	Oh my god, they wanted to shut it down because the John Wick's driving.
32259860	32260860	What's that mean?
32260860	32271860	I had a drink of cola.
32271860	32272860	Wait, nice noise.
32272860	32275860	What?
32275860	32279860	Is my camp young?
32279860	32281860	Did I fart and not mute?
32281860	32282860	Hold on, what noise?
32282860	32283860	You're making me nervous.
32283860	32289860	Did I fart and not mute?
32289860	32291860	You made a funny snorty noise.
32291860	32294860	Did I fart?
32294860	32296860	Oh my god.
32296860	32302860	I did drink of cola.
32302860	32304860	You made a funny noise?
32304860	32305860	I don't even remember.
32305860	32306860	I drank cola.
32306860	32309860	Maybe it got stuck on the way down.
32309860	32311860	It wasn't a breath.
32311860	32313860	Close, close no cigar.
32313860	32315860	I didn't even know what noise I made.
32335860	32356860	If you've seen it and you've seen it and you know you want to go to Tokyo.
32356860	32371860	I can't.
32371860	32378860	Well, we're actually getting praised in real time.
32378860	32399860	Me, mommy, me, I'm the big winner.
32399860	32425860	Is this Skrillex?
32425860	32429860	And maybe my stomach making a noise because I've not eaten since the past though.
32429860	32435860	But I'm not really that hungry.
32435860	32464860	My spine.
32464860	32492860	My stomach.
32493860	32502860	Are you okay, sir?
32502860	32503860	Oh, then again, they have guns.
32503860	32509860	I wouldn't get out of the car if someone's got guns and I ran somewhere and saws.
32509860	32521860	Can't stop, won't stop.
32521860	32534860	Friend or foe, question mark.
32534860	32536860	I don't, I don't get the angle.
32536860	32539860	I think he's going to turn into a friend.
32539860	32566860	Because they don't pay him and he's pissed at his hand.
32566860	32571860	You know the classic Citroen car, I've forgotten the name of it.
32571860	32580860	Oh, it might have been my feet on the seat.
32580860	32587860	He wants the bounty so he's going to keep him alive.
32588860	32592860	There's a French saying, I actually forgot the word.
32592860	32600860	Is it bullion? No, bullion soup.
32600860	32603860	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
32603860	32604860	Okay, yeah, yeah, that's right.
32604860	32605860	Walk off, walk off.
32605860	32607860	Walk off, you're fine, you're fine.
32607860	32610860	God, these movies cannot get away from like harm and animals.
32610860	32611860	Like relax.
32611860	32614860	I don't know who wrote the scripts, but y'all need to calm down.
32614860	32638860	So someone needs their like hard drive check for like some weirds going on at John Wick headquarters.
32638860	32641860	That dog literally build different for real.
32641860	32642860	It's a cyborg.
32642860	32660860	And that's why it's fine.
32660860	32661860	Oh, I like that.
32661860	32662860	That was unique.
32690860	32707860	Dude, you just shot that guy in the dick, dude.
32707860	32709860	Dude, what's wrong?
32709860	32717860	You just shot that guy in the dick.
32717860	32719860	What the fuck?
32719860	32720860	What the fuck?
32720860	32721860	What the fuck?
32721860	32722860	What the fuck?
32722860	32723860	What the fuck?
32723860	32724860	What the fuck?
32724860	32725860	What the fuck?
32725860	32726860	What the fuck?
32726860	32727860	What the fuck?
32727860	32728860	What the fuck?
32728860	32756860	What the fuck?
32756860	32757860	Hey, Kigtmin.
32757860	32758860	Is that you?
32758860	32760860	Any get, dude?
32760860	32763860	Oh, what's the deal?
32763860	32774860	Yeah, that was before you stabbed me in the hand weirdo.
32774860	32789340	Oh, it's backpack spiller proof!
32789340	32792540	Ehh!
32792540	32799660	Okay, that was cool.
32800620	32804620	Ehh!
32804620	32808620	Oh my god, it's about to background.
32808620	32814620	God, I have so much brain roll with that game right now.
32814620	32822620	Qua.
32823580	32829580	Daco.
32829580	32837580	Okay, so now he's not friend blue.
32838540	32854540	I love how he now has to use a wireless old timey phone, literally.
32854540	32862540	Oh, how else would they make the servant get their money's worth out of the servants?
32862540	32878540	BOO! Incider amul!
32882540	32886540	Wuuohhh!
32886540	32894540	Oh my god visually that's insane but I guess it highlights the pellet spread
32894540	32897540	against the shotgun.
32903540	32909540	I'm liking this like perspective as well.
32911540	32915540	This definitely feels different.
32916540	32934540	You know what, uh, Hotline Miami.
32939540	32942540	Hotline Miami, that's why.
32946540	32962540	Even the soundtrack, hold on a minute, did they just kinda go Hotline Miami this soon?
32971540	32974540	Right, no fall.
32976540	32978540	You know what I'm saying?
32978540	32980540	You know what I'm saying?
32980540	32982540	You know what I'm saying?

32994540	32996540	You know what I'm saying?
32996540	32998540	You know what I'm saying?
32998540	33000540	You know what I'm saying?
33016540	33018540	Okay.
33020540	33022540	Okay.
33022540	33047120	What, the Doug's not hostile anymore?
33047120	33050880	The Doug's occupied, alright.
33050880	33052880	He's away for a wee snack, breaking a wee water.
33080880	33082880	The Doug's not hostile anymore.
33082880	33084880	The Doug's not hostile anymore.
33084880	33086880	The Doug's not hostile anymore.

33226620	33230780	bit we get it can we get to the location to do the plot we're kind of
33231180	33238540	quest continuously right now so our last side quest unlocked a secret ally that was
33238540	33244300	originally wanting to get us okay I understand but can we you know get to the location I get it
33244300	33250780	we're under attack but come on I was still got another half an hour that's fine because the
33250780	33259900	plot I guess is gonna pick up but yeah damn I don't know if it's a woman moment but
33260860	33266220	you know you gotta get me something to bite into other than pew pew I will admit the hotline
33266220	33283580	Miami scene was good because they did something very different but now don't get me wrong I
33283580	33287500	understand it's explaining that he's such an unstoppable force
33292300	33292540	but
33295660	33299500	and the henchmen ain't gonna perish themselves I know but I'm like come on
33301660	33305820	if you're gonna be like oh he's under a timer let's not do a billion side quest then huh
33305820	33312060	oh
33335820	33338820	Uuughh.
33359820	33362820	Killing my patience as well.
33362820	33366820	Like, I do get the emphasis that he's like such a bad un-
33366820	33369820	like, you just kinda kill him type thing.
33370820	33374820	Please, get into that. Just teleport there at this point.
33374820	33379820	Just no clip through the damn walls and stuff at this point. Please.
33379820	33383820	I am on my knees. Give me a bit more plot. Give me a bit more of a plot.
33383820	33385820	Go on, give me a plot. Yeah-
33385820	33389820	Aaaaaaah! Please! Yeah!
33389820	33391820	Awww.
33393820	33394820	Oh, for-
33398820	33402820	I am sure this is supposed to be a humorous gag, but...
33419820	33426820	I get it's supposed to be a humorous gag. It would be humorous if the scenes weren't-
33426820	33430820	had- the combat hadn't gone on for like a solid 40 minutes.
33430820	33433820	Oh, and of course he doesn't make it in time. What a surprise.
33433820	33436820	So they cheated.
33436820	33442100	weren't had the combat hadn't gone on for like a solid 40 minutes oh and of
33442100	33445540	course he doesn't make it in time what's prize
33452940	33456060	so they cheated
33456420	33468740	wait Kane isn't there either it's up but Kane
33472060	33477780	wait they're both lay on he's lay on purpose or something
33487060	33495780	yes mr. Kane thank you mr. Kane
33502700	33508620	that stunt double I hope he got paid his weight in gold for that staircase scene
33508620	33513580	because those are like so dangerous and especially with the outfit that John
33513580	33519180	Wick is assigned he's so skinny Malinky in such an outfit that the padding the
33519180	33523620	stunt double receives has to be
33544580	33550540	I am so confused where this movie is going
33552620	33558660	like aren't they about to fight each other in literally two minutes time
33558660	33575060	mmm co-op mode literally they've just swapped from single-player to co-op
33579140	33584620	and they're very odd friends indeed
33588720	33590720	I
33596600	33598600	off
33598600	33621640	Kiana raced at all his own stuns?
33621640	33622640	Is he crazy?
33622640	33629640	Oh for fuck's sake the poker table allies are all coming together.
33629640	33638640	The dog's judging him, the dog said come on he saved me.
33638640	33656640	I'm not, but he can.
33657640	33684640	Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
33684640	33691640	I wondered why they focused.
33691640	33698640	Hi Popper.
33698640	33701640	You're one of them aren't ya?
33701640	33730640	I thought it was a girl puppy.
33730640	33735640	Oh did he just work me?
33735640	33736640	You mind?
33736640	33740640	How long it took me to get here?
33740640	33745640	That hurt.
33745640	33748640	That was my shooting hand.
33748640	33761640	You imagine a random tourist walking past being like drunk as shit, what, seeing this?
33761640	33769640	Peeler, the Peeler dog honestly.
33769640	33782640	We made it somehow, every just little.
33782640	33784640	Aw.
33812640	33833640	Ha, no way, consequences.
33833640	33854640	Hey, I like that billet detail.
33854640	33864640	More billets coming off of them.
33864640	33869640	I thought it was a girl cause she went oh good girl like way earlier.
33869640	33873640	Or she, maybe I just made that up.
33873640	33875640	Me, I'm the dog all along.
33903640	33906640	You
33933640	33935640	You
33963640	33965640	You
33993640	33995640	You
34007640	34012640	Everyone hates the high table.
34012640	34019640	What if we agreed to shoot each other in the shoulder and no one dies?
34019640	34029640	Wait what if we can't just ever do this shit?
34029640	34041640	Can we can't just ever do this like really quick?
34041640	34043640	Wait how many, we only have two billets.
34043640	34044640	How many guards?
34044640	34046640	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
34046640	34058640	I have hope and then nine for the bad guy cause the old man doesn't want this.
34058640	34066640	No, he missed on purpose.
34066640	34074640	They both missed on purpose.
34074640	34080640	Fuck.
34080640	34086640	Okay, give us another cheeky billet then.
34086640	34089640	Cause you only gave us one.
34089640	34094640	Thank you.
34094640	34096640	Please, Katniss, everything this.
34096640	34113640	I'm gonna go fucking way older so you can't, Katniss, everything this.
34113640	34115640	One, nine.
34125640	34132640	No.
34146640	34150640	Come on, King.
34150640	34162640	No, he can't walk steady.
34162640	34169640	Your enemy is my enemy.
34169640	34171640	Your enemy is my enemy.
34171640	34184640	Come on.
34184640	34186640	And who is him?
34186640	34188640	Come on, who is him?
34199640	34217640	Come on.
34217640	34219640	Oh man, please.
34247640	34273640	Come on.
34273640	34275640	They're finishing me with the final moves.
34275640	34304640	Oh, come on.
34304640	34308640	Anyone.
34308640	34317640	He never saw.
34317640	34327640	Wait, the guards don't care.
34327640	34347640	The guards to the elder guy, I guess?
34347640	34349640	All he had to do was shoot, I guess?
34349640	34357640	That was in the rules of the marathons and...
34357640	34362640	Oh.
34362640	34369640	A still illegal move?
34393640	34397640	Can we get like an ambulance or something?
34397640	34401640	You know, should you give it a medical assistance here and there?
34401640	34407640	A few gauze if you've got it.
34407640	34413640	You know, maybe a pump of O-negative blood if anyone's got O-negative.
34413640	34416640	Yeah.
34452640	34461640	Again, you persist, Mr. Wick.
34461640	34476640	Against all odds.
34476640	34479640	Oh.
34479640	34483640	He doesn't think he's gonna make it.
34483640	34487640	Spoilers, there's a five in production, thank god.
34487640	34490640	Oh wait, no, sorry, he just means like actually take me to New York.
34490640	34493640	Sorry, sorry, forgot what country they're in.
34493640	34495640	Hold on a minute, they're in France.
34495640	34499640	Hold on a minute, didn't think that one through.
34499640	34501640	Wait.
34501640	34502640	Oh no, he does think he's dying.
34502640	34507640	Hold on, I spoke too soon, but thankfully there is John Wick 5 in production.
34507640	34512640	Okay, my apologies, not only did I ruin that, reversed it, then did it twice.
34512640	34516640	Okay, I take it back, there's a John Wick 5 coming.
34516640	34519640	But he thinks he's dying, but he can't.
34519640	34522640	There's a John Wick 5.
34522640	34528640	And if you're telling me that Osaka chick is John Wick 5, no, no, no, no.
34528640	34529640	Not at all.
34529640	34530640	Not at all.

34569640	34571640	John Wick 5 is a thing.
34571640	34574640	You're not him, bro!
34577640	34581640	Absolutely rigged and dirty.
34581640	34585640	Thank God you guys spoiled. There's a whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
34600920	34601920	Question mark.
34605400	34607480	For once in my life, question mark.
34611880	34612380	Huh?
34614080	34614580	Huh?
34617320	34620040	Motherfucker, you said there was a five.
34623560	34624060	Hello?
34638800	34640000	That's fake, right?
34642240	34642740	What?
34645840	34646340	What?
34649440	34649940	Whoa!
34654840	34656240	No, he's still alive.
34669080	34669580	Whoa!
34671640	34681640	No, he's like, hidden behind a tree, right? And he's not really dead.
34683240	34686040	You said there was a John Wick five.
34688540	34691240	I know he's buried beside his way.
34695440	34698240	You told me there was a John Wick five.
34699240	34701840	He's like behind a tree, right?
34704840	34706840	Is he not behind a tree?
34711040	34714840	Wait, whoa! Why would you do that to me?
34714840	34717440	There's no, like, after-sync credit.
34719840	34723440	There's no evidence that he actually died!
34724440	34725440	No!
34725440	34726440	Whoa!
34728840	34729840	Whoa!
34731040	34733440	I'm, like, laughing and crying.
34733440	34736440	He actually fucking died!
34738440	34739640	He fucking-
34740840	34742640	Wait, are you serious?
34744840	34748640	Why is he actually dead after all of that?
34750840	34751840	Wait, whoa!
34754640	34757240	No, he's gone into the credits.
34758640	34761440	I don't think there's a posting credit!
34761440	34762840	Is he dead?
34765440	34766840	Is he actually dead?
34767440	34770440	Oh, wait, there's a posting credit! What the fuck are you doing? Stop!
34770440	34771840	Skip to the end!
34771840	34774640	Skip to the end! There's a posting credit!
34775440	34779040	I'm gonna throw up! I'm gonna throw up!
34779040	34780440	There's a posting-
34780440	34781040	Wait, go-
34782840	34784040	Go to the end!
34785840	34786840	Stop!
34788440	34793240	No, I don't think Sol is in the fact that he can see his daughter again!
34793840	34795240	No!
34797240	34798240	Stop!
34799840	34801640	Why did you kill him?
34806040	34810440	No! The fucking Osaka bitch killed him! No!
34811040	34812240	Why?
34812240	34815240	No, no, no, no, no, no!
34816240	34819440	No, no, it makes it so much worse!
34819440	34821440	No!
34824440	34827440	I can't believe we're in Skip anymore!
34828840	34831440	What the fuck is this?
34833440	34836440	You told me there was a five!
34836440	34839440	I believed you!
34839440	34843440	And he doesn't get to see his daughter!
34843640	34845640	I'm fucking distraught!
34845640	34848640	How am I supposed to make way?
34848640	34850640	An edge mill!
34852640	34853640	Oh my god!
34854640	34856640	What the fuck?
34857640	34861640	I'm fine, I'm okay, I'm sweating, but what the fuck?
34865640	34867640	He actually dies!
34867640	34870640	I thought I was being so fucking cocky in this scene!
34870840	34875840	He's fine, just get him some O-negative blood, he's fine!
34876840	34881840	Oh yeah, just taking me back to New York, I can't be arsed driving the plane myself!
34883840	34890840	And then fucking Kane McGee doesn't even get to see his daughter!
34892840	34895840	Who the fuck wrote that script?
34896840	34900840	What a horrible person you are to lay waste to that!
34900840	34903840	Why would you create something like that?
34905840	34907840	Why?
34907840	34910840	Why can't we have happy endings?
34910840	34914840	Is it too much to ask for happy endings?
34917840	34919840	Do we know what's in John Wick 5?
34919840	34926840	Please tell me they fucking cloned him, and he's the first human clone, and he's still him.
34926840	34929840	And they clone his wife, and then they go on dates and stuff.
34929840	34936840	I would just watch that to be honest, they catch up and do the work and stuff together.
34938840	34941840	Nothing is known about fire, okay?
34942840	34944840	Is that a prequel?
34944840	34947840	I'm fucking cheating, hold on, I'm looking up the prequel.
34947840	34951840	I'm looking up on ID, NBM, Elemental P or whatever the fuck it is.
34956840	34959840	Oh my god, what one is it? What one's the game?
34960840	34962840	I don't know, hold on.
34962840	34966840	It's like a fucking browser source or something.
34967840	34969840	Oh, I'm gonna be sick!
34969840	34978840	I don't know, is John Wick in the fucking ID Elemental P website where it's like, oh this is who this actor is in this?
34981840	34985840	They are thinking about how to revive him, they fucking better.
34985840	34988840	Sorry, they better put a defibrillator on his corpse and dig it up and shit.
34988840	34993840	But tell me he's behind a tree right now, and they just had to do that for sure.
34995840	34997840	He actually dies.
34998840	35000840	Why the fuck did we watch that?
35000840	35004840	Why did I put that on? I thought he was, he can't be killed.
35006840	35018840	Keep in mind we just saw him collapse, he was like, well, I don't know, considering the gravestone said what he wanted the gravestone to say, like, saw us, but I'm a doubter.
35022840	35023840	I'm a doubter.
35024840	35026840	He actually dies, what the fuck.
35028840	35032840	He's not behind a tree, he's actually in a farm. That makes no sense.
35034840	35037840	The ending just teases what happens with Cain.
35037840	35039840	Oh, I don't care about Cain.
35039840	35048840	I mean, I do that he sees his daughter, but I don't have the patience to go through another movie to be like, I finally get to see my daughter.
35052840	35055840	They are keeping, yeah.
35058840	35061840	And he gets to be with his wife and Daisy.
35063840	35068840	I was being so fucking cocky because she told me there was a five that he couldn't die.
35068840	35073840	I was like, yeah, no, he can just take all the damage because it's fine, he's coming up in five.
35076840	35078840	Oh my god.
35080840	35082840	All I do is cry.
35083840	35095840	All I do is cry, these are supposed to be action pu pu movies, and I put them on because I'm like, oh, it's gonna be like Transformers, all cool and stuff, yeah, let's do that, they're so cool, yeah, action movies.
35099840	35106840	They can't even call it John Wick 5 without Big Johnny Boy being there, so he is hiding behind a tree like a fanny, honestly.
35107840	35112840	Literally, he's away grinning to himself being like, they got a wee gravestone of me.
35114840	35118840	He's actually just raising an army, clearly.
35119840	35121840	Can we watch Cool Family?
35121840	35125840	Yeah, next time we watch something, it's gonna have to be something easy.
35125840	35131840	My body's literally shaking right now because I'm so emotionally distraught after that.
35132840	35143840	And before the fifth one's a prequel, I think it's probably gonna be because, yeah, I don't see why he would be hiding behind a tree, Avengers style.
35147840	35149840	Bring him back like Robocop.
35149840	35157840	It could be him after four, it could be a prequel about his tale of how he became, that's probably the...
35158840	35160840	Because, yeah.
35161840	35163840	Because why would you show a gravestone?
35163840	35166840	And it literally had the words on it.
35166840	35170840	And fucking Big Winston said goodbye to us and shit.
35172840	35176840	Is there John Wick 5 stars and he's sitting on a bench eating a sandwich?
35176840	35178840	Literally I'd sit and watch that, so I would.
35179840	35186840	John Wick tries to get back into a regular 9-5 and he's working at Starbucks and he can't handle the rush orders.
35186840	35193840	And he doesn't understand when someone orders 12 sugar pump how much they're killing themselves with the drink.
35193840	35201840	And he gets really mad because every time someone orders a drink, that one drink alone is his one hour wage because of how bad wages are.
35202840	35204840	Mm, okay, yeah, I'd watch that.
35204840	35211840	Okay, I take solace in the fact that I can see him in a Starbucks apron right now in a little Starbucks hat, repping it with his long hair.
35211840	35213840	Mm, yeah, okay.
35213840	35215840	Copium, copium.
35215840	35217840	Counterpoint Palpatine.
35217840	35222840	That was rubbish in Star Wars, well, am I right?
35222840	35227840	Um, I'm gonna need a big old sleep after that one.
35227840	35229840	Oh, no, that's wine.
35229840	35231840	Oh my god.
35233840	35237840	I can't believe that, why would anyone write that?
35237840	35239840	Why would anyone do that?
35240840	35251840	Is the IBDM or whatever that website up for John Wick 5, if it is, can you say if the female Helen is in it?
35251840	35258840	If the female Helen is proven to be in the cast, we know it's a prequel because she isn't supposed to move.
35258840	35263840	She doesn't move in the picture, so she doesn't get credit for being Helen.
35263840	35270840	It's, here is 6am, how am I supposed to sleep?
35270840	35274840	They could do a cop out and have it be someone else's funeral.
35274840	35277840	But why, what would that do?
35277840	35287840	That's the worst point, is that he got completely pardoned and could go back to the life, well, he had in quotation marks.
35289840	35295840	But that was the whole point, he had just achieved that life and then he perished right after it.
35297840	35299840	Bro, what?
35300840	35307840	Bro, I'm going to have to play Belchow tomorrow to cheer me up, because what the fuck?
35307840	35315840	There's no official cast list yet, man, I hate that website, elementopimbdm.com or whatever it is.
35315840	35321840	It doesn't say anything about the plot or the actors.
35321840	35328840	The Continental is a series about Winston from 2023, any chance we're going to watch that?
35329840	35334840	Is this after 4? Like, the Continental has been restored?
35334840	35341840	Every time I say Continental, I think of Ice Age Continental Drift, I don't even think I've watched it, but yeah.
35341840	35345840	And we need some Gamber to cheer up my brain again.
35345840	35347840	I didn't realise he...
35347840	35359840	I think 5 is a prequel because it was so successful that they want to milk it for more pennies, which is fine, because it goes to Keanu Reeves and I'll eat him, so...
35362840	35370840	Next movie is called Ballerina with Keanu Reeves, sorry, I can't speak, but he's not the main character.
35370840	35372840	Nah, it's from before.
35378840	35383840	I'm gonna need some emotional break after that, I was not prepared for that.
35383840	35388840	Oh sorry, there's a bird literally hanging out right outside my window, oh my god.
35389840	35391840	I was so freaking cocky!
35392840	35394840	I was like so cocky.
35395840	35398840	Sorry, my voice is going...
35401840	35403840	I've got a wee bit of game audio in the background for you.
35413840	35422840	I had a feeling you'd have this reaction and none of you has warned me, you'll let me fall into the sensibility of main character can't die because...
35423840	35433840	Because there's a fifth movie coming out, no, I'm literally sweating, I'm gonna have to get a shower before I go to bed, I'm sweating that much from my emotional distraught.
35434840	35436840	Unbelievable.
35436840	35443840	No, spoiler, sorry, no, thank you for not spoiling it, but at the same time, Reflins!
35443840	35447840	Why did you not warn me how unbelievably sad John Wick is?
35447840	35451840	I don't even remember the first one being so sad.
35452840	35458840	Fucking, I'm such a cry baby, I literally just proven I'm like the cry baby out of all of us at VLOG.
35460840	35463840	I hadn't seen any of them, I never expected, is it gonna be so emotional?
35463840	35465840	Fucking, look at that!
35465840	35466840	Pew pew!
35466840	35468840	Transformers!
35468840	35470840	Like, oh so fun, let's go!
35470840	35474840	And then I've got Iron Man next, thank god, I don't have to watch that.
35475840	35484840	We're not watching anything further than Iron Man because I cry my eyes out at freaking, how you call it as well, like Marvel series.
35484840	35487840	Maybe Avengers assemble, I quite like that.
35487840	35489840	Are you squiddin' me right now?
35490840	35492840	To be fair, you said no spoilers.
35493840	35497840	I know Brian, and Broly Legend, thank you for the tip.
35497840	35502840	I know I said no spoilers and thank you for respecting it, but at the same time, oh my god,
35502840	35511840	I was watching that being so, pardon me, being so cocky, like mm, mm, yeah, yeah, there's a John Wick 5, yeah, yeah, yeah, right, wrap it up, wrap it up.
35512840	35518840	But then it didn't, like as it progressed, it didn't make any sense because he literally got pardoned by the guy.
35521840	35523840	And just...
35524840	35525840	Ugh.
35528840	35529840	Ugh.
35533840	35538840	I knew the first one was intensely sad, but I didn't expect that.
35538840	35542840	And I always thought John Wick was just a pew-pew, literally a bamboozled.
35542840	35544840	Would you have liked it if we had actually spoiled it?
35544840	35550840	No, if you spoiled it, it wouldn't have been the same if I knew what was coming up.
35551840	35558840	Like, literally as he walked down the flipping church, I was like, ah, he's fine, he's fine.
35558840	35566840	And then the scene fades and it says gravestone and I'm like, uh, what?
35567840	35572840	What? What? What?
35574840	35576840	Like, it doesn't make any sense.
35579840	35584840	I thank you, thank you impossible, you couldn't die made it even worse, honestly.
35584840	35591840	I was like, wait, he's literally, I don't know what, it must be a Marvel film, I'm thinking of.
35591840	35597840	There's one where they're all at a gravestone for someone, but they're not actually dead, they're like hiding behind a tree, watching over.
35597840	35604840	Which is exactly what I thought, I was like, oh, he's behind a tree, but then the camera didn't do a big wide shot pan.
35604840	35609840	I'm like, uh, hold on a minute, hold on a minute.
35610840	35616840	Uh, to be fair, it was the first time I watched the movie, okay, you're not being punished.
35617840	35635840	Oh my god, sorry, the next few movie choices, bruv, I'm gonna have to pick familiar movies that are like funny or ha ha, because bruv, bruv, I'm distraught, I am distraught, okay?
35636840	35646840	Um, so we did good, yes he also did, Hollywood rules, no dead, no body, no death, the whole blind guy stick didn't make any sense.
35646840	35662840	I have to admit, I probably would not, um, I would say the first one was my favourite, and then the second one and then the third and then the fourth is, I would, personally I would not rewatch the fourth.
35662840	35675840	No, not just because of the emotional turmoil right at the end for me, but because I didn't really, stuff felt so extended and it felt very gimmicky.
35675840	35684840	Um, I wish, perhaps, it was not like so, but it was at the end of the day.
35684840	35690840	I wish like the enemy to allies type thing came a lot faster as well.
35690840	35701840	I liked the scene when they were at the poker table in particular, and it was like, hold on a minute, we're all against this German guy and it was like, well, keep up that energy, like, keep it going.
35701840	35712840	Um, because the guy with the dog doesn't, so he clearly wanted the bounty for John Wick, one big bounty and then he's done,
35712840	35715840	but he's very clearly a skilled assassin.
35715840	35724840	So, really, what's the dealio about him not just going for like, really simple targets other than, you know, Baba Yaga himself?
35724840	35734840	Nah, I know you could say, but the money was so much for him over anything else, but like, I feel like that ally arc could have happened hell of a lot quicker.
35734840	35748840	And then Kane at the end, like, just fucking going up those 222 steps, I was like, fucking hurry up, man.
35748840	35755840	Like, there was a few scenes where I'm like, hmm, I wasn't exactly digging it.
35755840	35759840	Klaus was funny though, I am Klaus.
35760840	35769840	Yeah, I don't, I think, I think maybe, I don't know why the fighting scenes don't really seem to do it as much for me.
35769840	35771840	I felt like they just went on too long.
35771840	35784840	Now, I like when they're like, oh, look how cool he's doing this and that, but I don't know if maybe because I can't appreciate the choreography the way maybe someone else can, um, that it looks very seamy.
35784840	35797840	I think the reason why I appreciate the, um, the bird's eye view scene, so much Hotline Miami scene, if you will, was because it looked completely different.
35797840	35803840	And it gave you a perspective of like enemies from all sides and he just keeps mowing them down.
35803840	35812840	Whereas like the jump cuts and the other battle scene, battle scene, well, I guess they are battles technically, just felt like, okay, okay, we get it, we get it.
35812840	35814840	But as Baba Yaga, okay, we get it.
35814840	35817840	Wrap it up, wrap it up.
35817840	35820840	Keanu Reeves is 59?
35820840	35825840	No, he needs to stop doing his own stunts like right now.
35830840	35833840	He needs to stop doing stunts right now.
35833840	35835840	He is, he is beyond like repair.
35835840	35839840	He's probably done some serious damage during those shoots then, if that's true.
35839840	35841840	Holy crap, 59.
35842840	35846840	They were cool at first, but yeah, after the fourth one is starts to look a bit seamy.
35846840	35854840	Yes, I'm sure if like we were choreography people, we would be able to be like, ah, this tactic and this was used and that was used.
35854840	35866840	But fortunately, I do not have an eye that can appreciate that type of art, so I can only apologize through my ignorant eye that, um, it did look a bit seamy.
35866840	35868840	Well, he's dead, so he doesn't need to do any more stunts.
35868840	35870840	Thank you for rubbing that in, Reefling.
35870840	35872840	Just for you, here's the timeout.
35872840	35874840	Oh, hold on, need to open up.
35874840	35876840	Oh, for fuck's sake, I can't.
35876840	35878840	Wait, I need to close my...
35878840	35880840	Where's the heck is my wee window?
35883840	35885840	Hold on a minute.
35885840	35888840	Right, put that away because we don't need it.
35888840	35891840	Put that away because we don't need it and put that away because we don't need it.
35891840	35895840	Okay, and then I open up YouTube.
35895840	35897840	No, Mod, did you just take it?
35897840	35898840	I'm supposed to do it.
35898840	35900840	No, Mod, you ruined it.
35900840	35901840	I'm supposed to do it.
35904840	35906840	You didn't actually ruin it, Mod, by the way, I'm just teasing.
35906840	35912840	Um, what was I saying before I got wildly distracted there?
35912840	35914840	Uh, needing to time out anyone?
35914840	35915840	Rip that one Reefling.
35915840	35916840	Mod, span that, Mod.
35916840	35918840	Mod, time out that, Mod.
35918840	35919840	What's going on?
35919840	35922840	Um, but yes.
35926840	35928840	It's a, what?
35928840	35932840	Wait a minute, is this a culture clash?
35932840	35935840	Someone says what's half-a-living.
35938840	35941840	Reeflings, what time is half-a-living?
35943840	35945840	Is this a culture clash?
35945840	35947840	Do you guys not use this freeze?
35949840	35951840	What's half-a-living?
35952840	35954840	See one.
35954840	35956840	Whoa.
35956840	35959840	Okay, hold on.
35959840	35962840	You don't say that in America.
35968840	35970840	Okay.
35970840	35973840	Half-a-living means 1130.
35973840	35977840	Like half past 11, half-a-living.
35977840	35980840	Half past 10, half-10.
35980840	35981840	Who says half-a-living?
35981840	35982840	British folk apparently.
35982840	35986840	Someone's just commented on my most recent ASMR roleplay.
35986840	35988840	They're like, what's half-a-living?
35988840	35991840	Uh, wow, I did not know that.
35991840	35993840	You learn something new every day.
35993840	35995840	Hmm.
36005840	36007840	Whee.
36007840	36009840	Yes.
36009840	36014840	Someone says, I hope Stronea isn't actually a 43 foot giant squid using a voice changer.
36016840	36018840	Well.
36019840	36021840	Half-a-living, no.
36021840	36028840	Half-of-a-living is 5.25 or something.
36028840	36029840	Wait, no.
36029840	36030840	5.5, yeah.
36030840	36032840	Sorry, we don't speak EU.
36032840	36033840	Britons are wrong.
36033840	36034840	Britons are wrong.
36034840	36035840	Steady on.
36035840	36036840	Didn't we make the English language?
36036840	36038840	And by make, I mean steel parts of the French,
36038840	36039840	and then steel parts of the Germanic,
36039840	36041840	and then steel parts of the Latin.
36041840	36043840	She might be.
36044840	36046840	If Stronea's that big, imagine how,
36046840	36048840	imagine how much ink we should.
36048840	36052840	Oh, wow, we're actually about to get 29,000 on the wings.
36052840	36054840	Hmm.
36061840	36062840	Hmm.
36062840	36064840	5.25.
36064840	36065840	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
36065840	36067840	I've just had an emotional breakdown.
36067840	36069840	Thanks to John Wick 4.
36069840	36073840	I need to know, like, right now what the heck happens.
36076840	36078840	Still a level 92.
36078840	36083840	I, um, should we try and get 93 before I go off?
36083840	36086840	Now, I know I said I was going to do an endurance stream.
36086840	36088840	I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.
36088840	36090840	I am emotionally distraught right now.
36090840	36093840	My eyes are bulging out of the skull from how hard I was just crying there.
36093840	36097840	I'm not even going to pretend like I'm a crybaby.
36097840	36100840	Yeah, but we Britbongs shorten things sometimes.
36100840	36101840	I get what you mean.
36101840	36102840	Steal this, steal that.
36102840	36105840	How about you steal back the tea we dumped a mile?
36105840	36107840	Horny horny hor.
36107840	36108840	Oh my god.
36108840	36112840	Remember that one time the Americans revolted against British taxation
36112840	36114840	by putting the D into the harbor and it worked,
36114840	36117840	which is actually pretty crazy because normally,
36117840	36121840	actually, I tell a lie, you don't normally get taught
36121840	36123840	when revolution works.
36123840	36126840	It's, um, purposely not taught that often.
36127840	36130840	Unless it's done via memes, which is why everyone finds,
36130840	36132840	ha ha, dumping tea in the harbor funny,
36132840	36135840	but it's actually a form of revolution
36135840	36140840	and you're not really, you don't get many examples of it working.
36140840	36145840	Now you don't name another example of a revolution working.
36145840	36148840	It's okay, you can rest and we'll continue tomorrow.
36148840	36150840	What a waste of good tea.
36150840	36153840	Our little cuddly seaweed.
36153840	36155840	Tenors is an endurance stream.
36156840	36160840	And hospital and hospital.
36160840	36163840	Yeah, you get, yeah, you skip the duck
36163840	36167840	because, you know, you're still at the hospital either way.
36167840	36169840	Our little cry baby.
36169840	36170840	Yeah, you can do that.
36170840	36172840	You can make me cry again.
36172840	36175840	What if I cried and then you put me on your lap
36175840	36177840	and then like pet my hair and stuff
36177840	36180840	and rocked me back and forth,
36180840	36183840	reinsuring me that John Wick was a good man.
36183840	36188840	Um, I mean, yeah, yeah, I'll do it.
36188840	36192840	Damn, no chance of getting you to watch my queer
36192840	36194840	when the promise flower blooms
36194840	36197840	then that movie will make you call your mom crying your butt.
36197840	36202840	Stop, no, I'm not touching any film that has any...
36202840	36204840	Someone said how to train your dragon
36204840	36206840	and I'm pretty sure I got a warrant.
36206840	36209840	Someone else commented as a warning being like,
36209840	36210840	do not put that on.
36210840	36212840	And I'm like, ew, okay.
36212840	36215840	I thought it was just a cute show about a dragon.
36215840	36219840	A cute movie because the first movie I did watch
36219840	36223840	where he gets the dragon
36223840	36226840	and they become friends and they can both fly
36226840	36228840	but they need each other and stuff.
36228840	36233840	Um, but yeah.
36233840	36236840	You're as beautiful as the day I lost you.
36236840	36238840	Mmm, I've seen that a lot.
36238840	36240840	I don't know what it's from, but...
36240840	36241840	But no, sorry.
36241840	36243840	I know it's from how to train your dragon
36243840	36245840	but I don't, like, I've not seen that.
36245840	36247840	Mmm, maybe it's in the second one.
36247840	36251840	I think there's three how to train your dragon.
36251840	36254840	How come how to train your dragon is nice?
36254840	36256840	I don't know, someone warned me saying
36256840	36258840	that there's something emotionally distraught in it
36258840	36260840	and I'd probably be an absolute blubber and mess.
36260840	36262840	I need to recover and do some, like, funny ha ha,
36262840	36267840	like, um, the Monty Python type stuff.
36267840	36270840	Funny ha ha, Iron Man again, it's got good music in it
36270840	36273840	and we can look at the cool weapons and stuff.
36273840	36277840	Like, I need to recover from what I've experienced today.
36277840	36279840	Cocky just...
36279840	36281840	Oh, there's a John Wick 5.
36281840	36284840	Obviously he can't perish and he perishes.
36284840	36287840	Ugh, now watch the second one.
36287840	36289840	The second movie, is it okay?
36289840	36291840	Gotta cry every time I have to train your dragon too.
36291840	36293840	Okay, so that's what's making me...
36293840	36294840	I'm getting nervous.
36294840	36295840	I'm getting nervous.
36295840	36296840	I'm getting shaky about that movie.
36296840	36298840	We'll come back, I wouldn't mind watching it
36298840	36301840	because it was, like, the only book I read as a child.
36301840	36303840	Um, oops.
36303840	36305840	Um...
36305840	36307840	But I need time, I need time to progress
36307840	36308840	what I've just went through.
36308840	36310840	Okay, I don't feel well.
36310840	36312840	I don't feel well.
36312840	36314840	I want to wrap myself up in a burrito.
36314840	36316840	I want to nuke myself on TikTok.
36316840	36317840	I would actually like to see more movies
36317840	36319840	slash shows that would make you cry
36319840	36323840	so that us leaflings can take care of you afterwards.
36323840	36325840	Okay, that's different.
36325840	36326840	That's different, then.
36326840	36327840	I'll allow it.
36327840	36328840	Um...
36328840	36329840	Oh, I forgot.
36329840	36331840	I'm ventriloquism right now.
36331840	36332840	I completely forgot that.
36332840	36334840	Is this still broken?
36334840	36337840	Hold on, let me close.
36337840	36340840	I don't know why it's lagging behind,
36340840	36342840	but I'll just ventriloquist.
36342840	36344840	Thank you for the tip, Anon.
36344840	36345840	Anonymous, sorry.
36345840	36347840	I need to see your full name.
36347840	36349840	Anonymous, that's right.
36349840	36351840	You want me to cry more?
36351840	36352840	I mean, shit, let's just build up
36352840	36354840	how to train your dragon tomorrow, fuck it.
36355840	36356840	You want tears?
36356840	36358840	I'll show you tears.
36366840	36368840	Usually when I'm sad or go through
36368840	36370840	is when I watch shows that are sad
36370840	36372840	and jokes I knew I was already sad.
36372840	36374840	No, I would never do that.
36374840	36377840	When I'm sad, I try my best to like...
36377840	36379840	Well, work, I guess.
36379840	36381840	I just work through everything, to be honest.
36381840	36383840	Hold on a minute.
36383840	36386840	My own secret, I've cracked my own secret.
36386840	36390840	Yes, I just work through sadness.
36390840	36392840	I don't know, this sounds a bit silly,
36392840	36395840	but I don't really have time to be emotionally upset.
36395840	36398840	I have half work to do, sorry.
36398840	36403840	Earlier when I was editing the Patreon audio,
36403840	36406840	I say it earlier, it was probably 24 hours ago,
36406840	36409840	I guess I was doing it, maybe, I don't know.
36409840	36411840	Or 12 hours?
36411840	36413840	You know what I mean.
36413840	36416840	When I was editing it, I was like...
36416840	36419840	I was getting really tired of editing,
36419840	36422840	I feel frustrated because I have all these plans
36422840	36426840	and three more VTubers have agreed to do ASMR with me
36426840	36429840	and I feel like I'm letting them down type thing.
36429840	36431840	And I was getting frustrated and I was like,
36431840	36434840	I just want to lie down and rot, basically.
36434840	36439840	But then I was like, no, the reeflings need their inking session.
36442840	36446840	Yeah, but it's funny you always work too much, I don't know.
36446840	36449840	But I felt frustrated, but then I was like,
36449840	36451840	I don't have time to be frustrated,
36451840	36453840	I need to just keep going.
36453840	36457840	Who's that guy that's condemned to push that rock up the hill
36457840	36459840	and it always falls down at the end?
36459840	36461840	A bit dramatic of a comparison,
36461840	36465840	but I'm very late.
36465840	36468840	We have finished all four movies, there's no more movies.
36468840	36471840	It's just me explaining how distraught I am.
36471840	36474840	Please do not watch the John Wick series
36474840	36479840	if you find yourself to be a crybaby like myself, okay?
36479840	36482840	If you right-click the XP circle near the mini-map
36482840	36485840	and do set up, what does that mean?
36485840	36488840	XP, show XP drops.
36488840	36491840	This? You want this?
36491840	36495840	Okay, I put it on.
36496840	36498840	I think we'll get to level 93.
36498840	36500840	Wait, why did you go away?
36500840	36501840	Is that the right thing?
36501840	36503840	If you right-click, right-click.
36503840	36505840	Set up.
36505840	36507840	Whoa, what does it mean?
36507840	36509840	Do cooking, please.
36517840	36520840	Yeah, that looks right.
36521840	36524840	And then this blue, what the fuck?
36524840	36526840	Sorry, hold on.
36526840	36528840	Hold on, I'm being Papaga.
36528840	36529840	Wait, did I just level up?
36529840	36530840	No, it didn't.
36530840	36532840	What?
36533840	36534840	What?
36534840	36536840	Wait, people can see it.
36536840	36538840	Hold on.
36538840	36540840	Why does that not keep displaying?
36540840	36541840	Right-medium default.
36541840	36543840	Duration, perma.
36543840	36544840	Okay.
36544840	36545840	And what?
36545840	36546840	It stays up?
36546840	36548840	You stay up?
36548840	36550840	You stay up?
36550840	36553840	Okay, I think it stays up now.
36554840	36556840	Eh.
36557840	36561840	The reeflings need their incincision to take me out through for all.
36561840	36563840	Look, I get motivated in many ways.
36563840	36566840	Some ways are...
36568840	36572840	What the heck happened to my inventory to achieve that?
36572840	36574840	Hope you aren't getting too stressed.
36574840	36576840	No, things are like definitely coming down.
36576840	36580840	It's because I'm doing that thing where I give myself too much work at once.
36580840	36582840	That's what stressed me out.
36583840	36589840	I need to edit my Patreon audios for July.
36589840	36591840	I've not done that.
36591840	36594840	Because I've been focused on getting the girls set up with shorts now.
36594840	36600840	That's the next thing is trying to do shorts and getting them up-tick in subscribers.
36600840	36604840	Because I would love to get them play buttons at the end of the day.
36604840	36606840	I'm going to try my best.
36606840	36608840	I'm going to try my best.
36608840	36610840	I'm going to tell them everything that I'm doing.
36610840	36613840	And I hope for the best.
36613840	36616840	But it would be lovely to get them a play button.
36618840	36620840	Should we clip watch-alongs?
36620840	36625840	What, the part with me when I'm just crying uncontrollably?
36626840	36627840	Syphilis?
36627840	36628840	What?
36628840	36630840	Oh, Sisyphus.
36630840	36631840	Sorry.
36631840	36635840	I completely missed when you guys said the Rolling Stones guy name.
36635840	36638840	Where he shoves a stone up the hill.
36638840	36642840	I literally thought you were all seeing Syphilis and Unison at once.
36642840	36646840	And I'm like, what on earth did I see to get you guys to see that at the same time?
36646840	36648840	That was...
36648840	36650840	That was confused there.
36651840	36654840	There's GD clinics down at the left, love, honestly.
36654840	36655840	Honestly.
36656840	36658840	Wait, let me...
36658840	36660840	What do you call it, a sheebie like that?
36660840	36663840	It was a sheebie's internet that was dial-up.
36664840	36666840	It was Azura's internet.
36666840	36670840	I'm gonna try and get her moved out so I can buy her better internet.
36672840	36673840	Sort of PC.
36673840	36674840	Yeah, or PC.
36674840	36675840	Internet can keep up.
36675840	36677840	I clipped the part after the movie.
36677840	36679840	She said a really cool line.
36681840	36683840	Yeah, the leader sang into the Rolling Stones.
36684840	36686840	Mom, is it like 5 a.m.?
36686840	36688840	It is 2 p.m.
36688840	36690840	For me.
36691840	36694840	Because I run a business in Australia.
36694840	36696840	That's not even a joke.
36696840	36698840	There's no booms at the end of that.
36698840	36701840	It's like, it's a bridge, honestly.
36703840	36704840	But yes.
36705840	36707840	Remaining XP.
36707840	36708840	64.
36708840	36710840	Wait, why isn't it showing a big bar like that?
36710840	36712840	I've done that bar wrong.
36712840	36713840	Hmm.
36714840	36715840	Hold on.
36715840	36717840	I've done this wrong.
36717840	36719840	Set up.
36720840	36721840	What?
36724840	36727840	Just disable the current character.
36734840	36735840	Like...
36737840	36738840	Whoa!
36738840	36739840	I am smart.
36739840	36740840	I am so smart.
36740840	36741840	SMRT.
36743840	36745840	Is that what I was supposed to do?
36745840	36747840	Set the top line?
36747840	36749840	Set the top line?
36749840	36750840	Oh.
36750840	36751840	I mean, does this not work?
36751840	36753840	Technically this works?
36753840	36755840	And you can see I'm like right about to get it.
36757840	36759840	7 hours of driving.
36759840	36760840	Holy shit.
36760840	36763840	I would be bored out of my mind, I think.
36763840	36765840	I'd be a menace on the road.
36765840	36766840	That works.
36766840	36767840	Yeah, close enough.
36767840	36768840	We got there in the end.
36768840	36769840	That's the main thing.
36769840	36771840	It's just showing you the next level.
36771840	36775840	Yeah, we are gonna finish 47.
36775840	36778840	I don't think there's any other...
36778840	36779840	Brian!
36788840	36789840	Oh no, I'm okay.
36789840	36790840	I just...
36790840	36794840	Why the frick is this not going out of my inventory?
36794840	36796840	No, don't worry.
36796840	36797840	I'm honestly fine.
36797840	36799840	Thank you for the tip again.
36799840	36800840	Thank you for the 5.
36800840	36801840	Broly legend.
36801840	36802840	I promise I'm okay.
36802840	36803840	I'm just a cry baby.
36803840	36805840	That's the problem.
36808840	36809840	Yes.
36809840	36810840	I should think about lunch.
36810840	36812840	I have work in one hour.
36812840	36813840	Monk guys.
36813840	36814840	Monk guys.
36814840	36817840	I don't think there's any Villarra girl on right now.
36820840	36822840	So we'll be redirecting into someone.
36822840	36824840	I don't know who yet.
36825840	36828840	I was gonna bring my iron here and get 9-9 Kirk and Mesa.
36828840	36829840	Oops.
36829840	36831840	What does that mean?
36831840	36834840	Right, let's see if I can find someone to redirect into them.
36834840	36836840	Maybe there's a Yumi plus girl up.
36836840	36839840	They kinda do it a bit later than us.
36843840	36845840	Oh, they're playing Apex together.
36845840	36846840	That's...
36846840	36847840	Oh no, Azura's on League!
36847840	36848840	Oh, hold on, hold on.
36848840	36853840	Can someone bomb Azura's chat and ask her if she's going a bit further?
36855840	36856840	Can someone...
36856840	36861840	Any bleeding hearts want to ask if Azura is staying up a bit longer?
36862840	36864840	Get yourself some good takeout.
36865840	36867840	I actually need to boil my eggs.
36867840	36871840	I've bought eggs and then I've wasted 2.
36875840	36878840	Azura is addicted to League, sadly, yes.
36878840	36880840	It's ogre for her truly.
36887840	36891840	I've been stuck with lots of work and it doesn't help that outside of that
36891840	36894840	I've been feeling espresso-depresso.
36894840	36895840	I get you and I hope things...
36895840	36897840	Oh no, things get easier for me.
36897840	36899840	I like reset after I sleep.
36899840	36902840	Like, if I ever have the worst day of my life, I just need to sleep
36902840	36904840	and then I'll wake up and I'm like, oh, okay.
36904840	36906840	Okay, let's go again.
36906840	36908840	I'm like, okay, let me get it.
36908840	36910840	Let's see what edits I can do.
36910840	36912840	She's deep in the League minds.
36912840	36913840	Is she?
36913840	36914840	Direct into her then?
36914840	36915840	Right, hold on, let me...
36915840	36917840	Save changes.
36919840	36920840	Okay.
36922840	36923840	Right, we're almost there, oh my god.
36923840	36929840	And we're in 50, 29,000 wains.
36929840	36930840	So we're getting there.
36930840	36932840	So how many did we do today?
36932840	36934840	Like, over 10,000?
36934840	36937840	So what, that's two more endurance streams?
36937840	36942840	I just want to warn you, the odds of tomorrow's stream being changed are quite high.
36942840	36943840	Okay.
36943840	36945840	Do I think I'll be able to re...
36945840	36946840	Oh, easily.
36946840	36948840	We just need another...
36948840	36952840	Tomorrow I was going to watch my gen mate's content,
36952840	36957840	but I think I might be too emotionally upset for a longer stream.
36957840	36958840	Me.
36958840	36960840	Oh, I reset after I sleep.
36960840	36962840	Also me, I'm so emotionally upset over John Wick.
36962840	36965840	I cannot, like, have an endurance stream tomorrow.
36965840	36967840	I need to give myself a break.
36968840	36972840	Because I'm actually withering away.
36972840	36974840	What does it say?
36974840	36979840	You can make around 2.4k wains an hour if you're curious how long it'll be.
36979840	36983840	So if I've got 29, divide by 2...
36985840	36988840	Okay, let's do 20, divide by 2 instead.
36988840	36994840	Another 14 hours, so technically 2 endurance streams and then I'm good to go.
36994840	36995840	We did it.
36998840	37000840	So, Veltro then.
37000840	37002840	Possibly.
37002840	37006840	I do, I'm really, I'm thoroughly enjoying Veltro.
37006840	37009840	I want to see if I can get a win on every deck.
37009840	37011840	Whether or not we'll get it or not,
37011840	37015840	but our little trouser pants thing is just so OP.
37015840	37020840	And we're unlocking new cards as well for interesting, like, combinations and stuff coming up.
37020840	37021840	Combination.
37021840	37024840	So 11 hours if you're perfect.
37025840	37028840	No, I've got 29,000 wains.
37030840	37033840	What, 2.4k? Oh no, there's no way.
37033840	37036840	Didn't manage to drop my fire-making cake.
37036840	37038840	Cake, not cake, sorry.
37038840	37041840	Don't drop the cake, don't drop the cake, baby.
37041840	37045840	If you wanna feel free to play it, I think everyone will love it anyway.
37045840	37050840	Yeah, I think maybe the odds of me doing endurance runescape tomorrow are...
37051840	37053840	Not quite there, not quite there.
37053840	37056840	Well, not feeling like it, to be honest, not feeling like it.
37056840	37058840	Where are you, 9 million xp?
37058840	37060840	Well, I'm 7 million xp, get wrecked.
37062840	37063840	Wah.
37063840	37067840	I'm surprised there's not a faster way of doing cooking.
37067840	37070840	Is there really no faster way than wine?
37070840	37073840	Or is the burn rate too high on items?
37073840	37074840	Must be.
37075840	37076840	Mmm.
37076840	37077840	Mmm.
37077840	37079840	Shock and behavior.
37079840	37084840	I like hearing you play Belcher on the background, it helps me finish a bit.
37084840	37086840	What? It helps me finish it.
37086840	37090840	No, it helped me finish that bit for you yesterday.
37090840	37092840	What?
37092840	37099840	I like hearing you play Belcher on the background, it helped me finish that bit for you yesterday.
37099840	37101840	A meme? A meme?
37104840	37105840	The...
37105840	37109840	Oh, I commissioned myself pregnant, did I say that yet?
37112840	37114840	There's a faster way, but it's very quick and...
37114840	37115840	Oh, okay, okay.
37118840	37120840	Hearing her in the background will do them work.
37120840	37122840	Makes it less insufferable?
37122840	37124840	Yeah, you like that little Scotch accent?
37124840	37128840	Mmm, yes, you love this voice in your ears while you work away.
37128840	37130840	Mmm, that's right.
37130840	37135840	Do the most menial tasks while your boss makes a dollar and you make a dime
37135840	37138840	and that's why you take a fat shite on company time.
37138840	37140840	Oh, man.
37140840	37141840	No, the art bit.
37141840	37143840	Congrats on finding the game pregnant.
37143840	37145840	Thank you, it was really hard.
37145840	37148840	You know, the lights were off, there was a lot of reef lens,
37148840	37151840	there was a lot of slippery wet tentacles.
37151840	37155840	I'm going left and right, but hey, I commissioned it.
37155840	37160840	It's two weeks to get here, we'll write the script together, how outrageous.
37160840	37165840	The artist was actually a bit worried about me getting in trouble with YouTube for it,
37165840	37169840	but I'm like, I'm pretty sure YouTube doesn't ban pregnant people.
37169840	37173840	It's just me being like, oh, I can't wait to meet you little reef lens.
37173840	37179840	I'm going to be like, I've named you and you're going to be my baby boy
37179840	37183840	and I'm going to say all the exciting things that I...
37183840	37186840	I'm going to talk to you about your grandparents.
37186840	37190840	Me, Mon, Paul, I'm going to tell you that they're gamers
37190840	37193840	and I'm a gamer and I hope you might be a gamer too
37193840	37197840	and I'll show you all the fun things and I'll never be cruel about your hobbies.
37197840	37200840	I can't wait for you to share your hobbies with me.
37200840	37203840	It's now illegal to be pregnant on YouTube.
37203840	37205840	It was really hard.
37205840	37206840	What was us?
37206840	37207840	Exactly.
37207840	37210840	The baby and the father, both me for overall.
37210840	37212840	Getting pregnant, sure, but how could you be pregnant?
37212840	37216840	I think just because of how ridiculous YouTube is being right now,
37216840	37220840	they need to come out and say that your licking isn't allowed anymore
37220840	37223840	or they need to take a step back and be like,
37223840	37226840	look, women can breathe again in a three-deal
37226840	37229840	because it's getting a bit ridiculous.
37229840	37231840	You think you'll get away with that?
37231840	37235840	Well, I had a really good short made about ear licking
37235840	37237840	and I think it would...
37237840	37239840	Oh man, this is going to do numbers.
37239840	37241840	I thought it was going to do really well
37241840	37242840	but I'm too scared to upload it
37242840	37244840	because I've currently got a warning on the channel
37244840	37247840	and I'm like, hmm.
37247840	37249840	And I want to re-upload the clapping one
37249840	37251840	but like cut out the breathing section
37251840	37253840	where I breathed in the ear basically
37253840	37257840	because everything before the ten-minute mark was fine
37257840	37260840	but after the ten-minute mark, which was the inner ear breathing,
37260840	37261840	that's when they pulled it off.
37261840	37263840	They're like, that's what violated the terms of service
37263840	37266840	and I'm like, okay then.
37267840	37272840	So I might just cut off the end and re-upload it
37272840	37278840	and at a later date, like once the 90-day punishment is up.
37278840	37280840	So there's like another 80 days on the punishment.
37280840	37282840	They are not kidding around.
37282840	37285840	Three months punishment for like...
37285840	37288840	I mean, I get that they can't moderate everything all at once
37288840	37293840	because they're like, how insanely busy the website is both.
37293840	37294840	I was kind of worried about the same thing
37294840	37296840	before I posted the fan art to Twitter.
37296840	37297840	Hey, what are you trying to do?
37297840	37298840	You want to meet me cry again?
37298840	37299840	Yum.
37301840	37302840	Stop breathing, woman.
37302840	37304840	You're taking up all the MasterCard.
37304840	37306840	My favorite thing is like, I consent.
37306840	37308840	I consent and then it's a picture of MasterCard
37308840	37313840	and it's like, but do I consent or something like that?
37313840	37315840	If it works, use it as a 3K video.
37315840	37316840	Oh no.
37316840	37321840	So the next video upload is going to be a collab
37321840	37323840	and then it's going to be the 3K
37323840	37326840	and then it's going to be a collab and then it's the 4K.
37326840	37328840	I'm doing it like that because I've got a few people
37328840	37331840	waiting on content.
37331840	37333840	They've been waiting patiently for me.
37333840	37335840	And I'm taking my sweet time.
37335840	37337840	Is there someone you forgot to ask?
37337840	37339840	Yes, that's it.
37339840	37344840	The next 3K audio I think might be...
37344840	37346840	I don't know.
37347840	37351840	I've edited a burping audio, which is disgusting,
37351840	37353840	but I'm scared to upload it because I'm like,
37353840	37355840	well, I had the audacity to burp in the ear
37355840	37357840	as YouTube is going to be like,
37357840	37358840	ah, that's breathing in the mic.
37358840	37361840	Here's a strike and you can't stream for a week.
37361840	37365840	The rules are getting so arbitrary.
37365840	37366840	Arbiter.
37366840	37368840	As I said, we're playing Halo right now.
37368840	37369840	Arbiter.
37371840	37373840	I only wanted to ease your job.
37373840	37375840	I guess you like it though.
37375840	37376840	What is it?
37376840	37378840	It's an easy job.
37378840	37380840	What is this?
37382840	37386840	Stony is going to filter her audience before we do it.
37386840	37388840	I already did it.
37388840	37390840	I think I've told you guys this plan before,
37390840	37393840	but because I'll upload ASMR role-play videos,
37393840	37398840	no one is going to watch the live stream unless it's ASMR.
37398840	37400840	Because I only do ASMR once a week.
37400840	37404840	We're naturally more of a tight-knit community,
37404840	37408840	which I prefer because I feel like I can see what I want to do.
37409840	37413840	Whereas if I had a lot of eyes on me and I'm like,
37413840	37415840	I'm not sure you guys are like,
37415840	37417840	riefling rieflings, you know?
37417840	37420840	And it makes me nervous and it makes me scared.
37420840	37423840	But, you know, all as good as the,
37423840	37427840	all as good for the Dutch people.
37427840	37429840	Get fillered, get fillered, get fillered.
37429840	37432840	And the holding it in one didn't get any flak.
37432840	37433840	Nope.
37433840	37437840	It was limited ads and I on a whim sent a judgement thing.
37437840	37440840	And they let me put ads on, please let me hold it.
37440840	37443840	And I literally say, let me hold your Pintas at one point.
37443840	37445840	And they're like, yeah, that's fine.
37445840	37449840	But me breathing in the mic is a violation of terms of service.
37449840	37453840	So they have straight up, they have updated the terms of service.
37453840	37458840	And they are not, they've not publicly said it.
37458840	37463840	And it's resulted in people's entire channels like being deleted.
37463840	37466840	Like ASMR people's channels is like the straight up deleted.
37466840	37469840	Nay, nay warning, just a,
37469840	37471840	sorry my stomach just farted if you heard that.
37471840	37473840	Nay warning, nay none.
37477840	37478840	I'm still a tight note,
37478840	37480840	but you're already getting close to the 10K subscribers.
37480840	37485840	I need to test if my iPhone can work in the bathroom then.
37485840	37489840	Because I need to do my 10K special bath stream.
37490840	37493840	Doing ASMR in the bath.
37493840	37496840	Let's turn it into a bubble bath.
37498840	37501840	You say that, but the thing I'm looking forward to the most is the hypno stuff.
37501840	37505840	It's bizarre, hypno stuff is perfectly fine on YouTube.
37505840	37510840	I'm literally gonna reprogram your brain temporarily to forget your name
37510840	37514840	and respond to refling and YouTube's like, yeah, that's fine.
37514840	37517840	But breathing in your ear every just...
37520840	37524840	Even if I'm watching it two, three times speed.
37524840	37527840	Oh my God, I must yap so fast on times three speed.
37527840	37529840	It's not even real.
37529840	37530840	It's fine, just don't breathe.
37530840	37531840	Just don't breathe.
37531840	37533840	Five hands, just don't breathe.
37533840	37536840	I love the way I don't breathe.
37536840	37538840	Yes, baby.
37538840	37541840	No matter what I need, I need breath.
37541840	37543840	Right, once this pops,
37543840	37548840	I'm redirecting into lovely jubbly
37550840	37551840	Let's see.
37554840	37555840	I'm just checking everything's fine.
37555840	37557840	Everything looks good to me.
37561840	37564840	I got some shorts coming out soon, the girly.
37564840	37566840	Which I'm excited about.
37566840	37567840	I think I've already said that, sorry.
37567840	37569840	I always repeat myself because I keep forgetting.
37571840	37575840	I don't think the algorithm really uses what a creepling is.
37575840	37577840	Just have some rest.
37577840	37578840	I think you need it though.
37578840	37580840	Okay, I'm going to sleep after this.
37580840	37582840	I'm going to get a shower because I literally was sweating so much
37582840	37586840	when I had my little cry over at John Wick.
37586840	37589840	And then I'm going to go sleep.
37589840	37596840	I'm going to wake up and I'm going to edit an audio of AC and Emmy together
37596840	37600840	and pray that they both know what whispering is.
37600840	37605840	Not naming names, but I've sent a few scripts away.
37605840	37607840	And when I send a script,
37607840	37610840	I put in big bold letters and highlight it in red
37610840	37613840	and it says, please whisper through the whole script.
37613840	37617840	And sometimes I get back soft spoken or talking.
37617840	37621840	And it's actually very common.
37621840	37623840	It's not just like the viewer who I'm collabing with.
37623840	37624840	It's like really common.
37624840	37626840	I'll put it in big letters, please whisper.
37626840	37630840	And I'm like, so this is talking.
37631840	37633840	This is soft spoken.
37633840	37638840	You can still hear the thim in my voice while I'm speaking gentler to you.
37638840	37640840	I'm whispering.
37640840	37642840	Wow!
37642840	37644840	We got 93.
37644840	37647840	But whispering is when there's no thim to your voice at all.
37647840	37648840	There's no...
37648840	37649840	Uh-huh.
37649840	37651840	Okay.
37651840	37652840	Yes, but now you know.
37652840	37654840	Okay, 93.
37654840	37655840	Wait.
37655840	37657840	Why are you like that?
37657840	37659840	Oh fuck, there's not so much.
37659840	37660840	I'll just hide it.
37660840	37662840	I messed up so much.
37662840	37665840	I'll fix it tomorrow.
37665840	37667840	I'll fix it tomorrow.
37667840	37668840	Please forgive me, right?
37668840	37669840	What were we on?
37669840	37670840	93.
37670840	37672840	So, what is it?
37672840	37676840	Next level is just shy of 8 million XP.
37676840	37677840	That's quite a lot.
37677840	37679840	I'm not gonna lie.
37679840	37680840	I'm not going to lie.
37680840	37681840	Congrats, Momay.
37681840	37684840	You guys are gonna finish cooking faster than I am.
37684840	37685840	Congrats.
37685840	37686840	Now go to sleep.
37686840	37687840	Soon, soon, soon.
37687840	37688840	Like right now?
37688840	37689840	Right this side?
37690840	37691840	Okay.
37691840	37693840	Hopefully my microphone...
37693840	37695840	I'm actually gonna completely reset it tomorrow
37695840	37697840	because I don't know why it's lagging, but...
37697840	37699840	It is...
37699840	37701840	I'm just gonna ventriloquist
37701840	37705840	so my model doesn't react to my mouth at all.
37705840	37708840	Actually, I don't even think I've set up my model
37708840	37711840	to react to the microphone, which I should.
37711840	37714840	You reach your level, so now you have to change the parameter.
37714840	37715840	Exactly.
37715840	37717840	That's just how it works.
37717840	37718840	It just works.
37718840	37720840	Call me Todd Howard, because it just works.
37720840	37721840	Right.
37721840	37723840	I will actually go...
37723840	37724840	I'm gonna redirect into his work
37724840	37726840	because I don't want to waste the opportunity
37726840	37728840	in case she has had enough.
37728840	37729840	Right.
37729840	37731840	Thank you all so much for keeping me company
37731840	37734840	through my absolute distraughtness.
37734840	37736840	We're going to Night Night Cooking on this account too,
37736840	37738840	but I don't want it to be my untrimmed.
37738840	37739840	I have no idea what that means.
37739840	37740840	But good luck.
37740840	37741840	Yes.
37741840	37744840	Thank you so, so much for hanging out with me.
37744840	37745840	I appreciate it.
37745840	37747840	Thank you for anyone that joined me in world
37747840	37748840	3A free play.
37748840	37750840	I do do the 3A.
37750840	37752840	Unfortunately, I did recommend buying membership.
37752840	37755840	I didn't understand that I didn't need membership to do cooking.
37755840	37756840	That was on me.
37756840	37758840	I was being a silly Billy,
37758840	37762840	not thinking with my head and thinking with my willy.
37762840	37763840	Thank you.
37763840	37768840	Thank you so much for comforting me
37768840	37771840	during the absolute pain that is drawn wick.
37771840	37774840	Whoever said it is an action thing,
37774840	37778840	liar, distraught, cannot comprehend.
37778840	37779840	Okay.
37779840	37783840	Cannot comprehend how distraught that movie has made me.
37783840	37785840	How much did she cry?
37785840	37787840	If you want to skip her back a little bit,
37787840	37791840	feel free to listen to the moment where I realize that
37791840	37797840	John Wick 5 is most likely a prequel and not a sequel
37797840	37801840	because I was aware that John Wick 5 is a thing
37801840	37804840	and I was like ha ha ha ha ha,
37804840	37808840	but the ha ha ha ha ha part backfired horrendously.
37808840	37810840	But yes, thank you so so much.
37810840	37812840	I'm going to redirect into this error.
37812840	37813840	She's currently playing League of Legends,
37813840	37815840	so I'm sorry to expose you to that.
37815840	37817840	I don't know what's so bad about League.
37817840	37818840	I've never played it,
37818840	37821840	but I guess it's a bad game question mark
37821840	37824840	because everyone seems to complain about it question mark.
37824840	37825840	I guess it's like Apex.
37825840	37826840	Everyone's like,
37826840	37827840	I don't want to see Apex.
37827840	37828840	I don't want to see Minecraft.
37828840	37831840	And I was like, well, I jumped on Microsoft for you.
37831840	37833840	So how about you make a salt,
37833840	37835840	let me make a salt you.
37835840	37837840	That's absolutely awful.
37837840	37838840	I'm going to go to sleep.
37838840	37840840	No, I'm going to shower.
37840840	37841840	I'm going to go to sleep.
37841840	37843840	I've literally cried through all of the movies.
37843840	37845840	I think the third one, what,
37845840	37846840	maybe I peered up a little.
37846840	37848840	Was the third one the only one I didn't really greet at?
37848840	37850840	It looks like Azura's ending.
37850840	37852840	Oh, well, I'm glad I caught that.
37852840	37854840	Hold on.
37854840	37856840	Hold on, Positunes.
37856840	37857840	Hold on.
37857840	37862840	We need to raid into someone.
37862840	37864840	I'm going to shove you on Yumi plus.
37864840	37865840	I'm going to go ask Yumi plus.
37865840	37867840	Are you still playing Yumi?
37867840	37868840	Yumi, are you still playing?
37868840	37869840	What?
37869840	37873840	Oh, my Yumi's went offline.
37873840	37876840	I, me, is coming up.
37876840	37877840	Right.
37877840	37878840	I, me, is.
37878840	37879840	If Azura's going offline.
37879840	37880840	Yeah, she is.
37880840	37881840	Okay.
37881840	37882840	Thank you so so much for the little reeflings.
37882840	37883840	I'll see you tomorrow.
37883840	37884840	Please do not be surprised
37884840	37885840	if I'm not doing an endurance runescape tomorrow.
37885840	37887840	I will see how I feel when I wake up
37887840	37892840	because emotionally distraught as I said.
37892840	37894840	We might swap to Beltral
37894840	37895840	because I'm absolutely addicted
37895840	37897840	and I love it and I have so much fun
37897840	37899840	with you guys telling me what's up.
37899840	37902840	So thank you so, so much.
37902840	37904840	I will talk to you tomorrow.
37904840	37905840	Please look after yourself.
37905840	37906840	Please hydrate.
37906840	37907840	Please shower.
37907840	37908840	Please do not strain
37908840	37910840	when you go for a poopy
37910840	37911840	or you'll hurt your butthole
37911840	37914840	and hydrate and have more fiber
37914840	37916840	that'll help with your little poopies.
37916840	37919840	I don't know why I'm doing that.
37919840	37920840	Why am I like this?
37920840	37922840	But yes, I love you very much, reefling.
37922840	37923840	Please do look after yourself.
37923840	37924840	I will see you tomorrow
37924840	37927840	and I'm going to redirect into Amy from Yumi Plus.
37927840	37931840	As always, when I redirect into another strummer,
37931840	37934840	they are not always at the same comfortability as me.
37934840	37935840	Let's go.
37935840	37936840	Okay.
37936840	37937840	I will see you tomorrow
37937840	37939840	for most likely Balletro, okay?
37939840	37940840	I said it.
37940840	37941840	I said it, okay?
37941840	37943840	I mean, although we are actually
37943840	37946840	like what, 11 hours away?
37946840	37947840	Soon, soon.
37947840	37948840	Right.
37948840	37949840	I will see you at Giffy Givers tomorrow.
37949840	37950840	Please hydrate.
37950840	37951840	Please get snagged.
37951840	37952840	Please brush your teeth before bed
37952840	37954840	if you're going to sleep with me at the same time.
37954840	37959840	And then we'll see what happens tomorrow, okay?
37959840	37960840	Bye-bye.
37960840	37961840	Bye, reeflings.
37961840	37963840	Please look after yourself, okay?
37963840	37964840	Bye-bye.
