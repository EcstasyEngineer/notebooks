{"text": " I think I'll go in the corner today as if there's some sort of exiled beach over here. It doesn't really matter if I'm in the corner or not. I think I'll accidentally hide my runes in the bottom right widget if I go onto the that side so we're not going to go right in the corner for once. A Christmas mirror, honestly, I don't know. Right, I've just been prompted that I can put YouTube ads on, which I think means a stream's up, first of all. Hello, America, hiya, hello. You know the funniest thing about being a little bit late to streamers? Is that no one goes, oh no, she's cancelled because it's not even conceivable that I'm not streaming. That's my favourite concept, instead of like, oh, she's late, she must be sick, she has to cancel type thing. It's like, nah, she gambled away the house. She hates us, she does, like, it's actually rather entertaining. Good morning, good evening, and good afternoon, do we have some good fucking use of yellow headquarters a day? If I'm not mistaken, and I don't want to spoil it, so I need to go look for it to make sure it's there, and T, yes, it's there, and T minus four hours. None other than Azura Dooley has been successfully monetised on YouTube, bips out in awe, round of applause for Azura's milky titties, she's been monetised, and now I'm allowed to talk about what the fuck happened with Azura's monetisation, she got denied monetisation, and I had to make poor Azura read a script, and she, in the script, she was like, hi YouTube, well, in her voice, hi YouTube, I am Azura Dooley, a creator from America, I am a YouTuber, so I did not show my body, I can't do her voice, but poor Azura had to like, do this super serious freaking video for me, and I had to like, screenshot her channel, and she had to be like, and I play video games, and it was so annoying, because obviously you had to use normie terms, so poor Azura had to be like, and my fans are so excited to enjoy my membership stream, and support me via super chat, because we were trying to go for like, if you monetise her, you'll be in the money, because you had money, money, money at the end of the day, so Azura did that, and we had to send in the appeal all behind the scenes, because obviously I didn't want to be like, one of the talents who'd been freaking denied monetisation, that's awful, an entire month for her to get monetised, no, bad, however, I do have a slight announcement about that Azura stream, you read it right, it is handcam, and she's also taking doodle requests, that money is gonna help her move out, don't I make myself clear, that money that she makes, yeah, is gonna help her move out, okay, so I don't want to see one fucking gritty day comment, I don't want to see it, it's gonna help her move out, and what happens if mummy Azura moves out, mummy Azura is free to make even more content, okay, so anyone that, oh Azura, you don't do ASMR, no plays on your channel, oh, so you don't, you don't, I'm doing enough ASMR, guess what, if she moves out, what do you think happens, hmm, hmm, right, put two and two together, what do you think happens when she moves out, she makes more content, put your money where your move is, hmm, hmm, that's what I thought, that's what I thought, that's terrible, my voice is broken beyond repair, unfortunately it is cracking, the original plan was none other than 12 hours of Elden Ring, I can't believe I'm so sorry to announce this refling, she moves out, my cock goes up, honestly all the bleeding hearts agree with that, is that a new mantra for the bleeding hearts, she moves out, my cock goes up, that's terrible, I'm hilarious, hmm, are you getting a roommate, funny you mentioned that, I actually said Azura, she can come with me if she wants, and, and she was like down for it and I'm like, well there is a problem of migration, you know that tiny little problem of like packing up your whole life and moving country, she can live with me, oh live with me if you want to come, Streamer House is real, we, I've not been funny, it was discussed at Vail or Headquarters, the possibility, however, the money you need and able to run a Streamer House, you basically have to accept there's a deficit debt already on top of how to run the company, now very thankfully the way that this company's structured, there's really not much overhead at all, again, it's free to produce thumbnails, the girls can stream what you want, it doesn't cost me $5 for Azura to put up an ASMR stream, you know what I mean, obviously the models cost a lot of money but that deficit gets paid over time, like I'm going to have ASMR role play come out and a lot of them are going to pay off some of the things, imagine all the months from now, literally could you imagine us banging on each other's door like, I'm trying to record ASMR, stop, well I was going to say something highly inappropriate there, stop banger-basting yourself for Twitter audio, I'm trying to record ASMR right now, yes, imagine if she moves it, well she actually did message me, but you didn't hear this from me okay but this is Inside Our Secrets, she messaged me and she said I'm really looking forward to doing YouTube role plays, which I'm really glad about because I'm worried about overworking them but she's on the same page, she's got her July audios to record first, which she should hopefully, well she's fucking getting steaming the night, I see steaming right now, she's getting steaming on box shot roulette, you guys are going to, I don't know if she's played it before but whoa that game's kind of hard to wrap your head around a little bit, but would I say that to them honestly, I don't think you understand that being under the umbrella of a slang makes you really comfortable with people, like it just does, like I feel really comfortable around the girls, I feel like I could show a picture of my floof and be like just something to look right here and the girls would be like mmm I ain't you need to get that checked out, like I think that's the degree of comfort, like if I had the wee hang on my wee bit and I'd be like ahhh, so yeah, for me anyway, yes I am not comfortable, how does it, how does it freaked out please with you, oh no, oh no, this can't be, oh no, we're at 8000.2 subscribers, oh no, this can't be, you can't do this to me, oh no, right, one pound free food, right, all looks good in the neighbourhood so I think we can get started, is there anything that I missed whilst I was passed out asleep, anything, oh I need to be able to see, now I know brightness 10 bad but so if it was barely visible, I can actually still see that at the one but I feel like the stream can't you see it so obviously for stream reasons, no don't discard that, I like it, I just say hi, I don't wanna spoil a good game here, so we have played the base game before and we've just never played the DLC, actually don't know how it gets activated, oh no, I think we did Samurai last time, why is Wretch need to, I confess there uses, see I need a two handed heavy hitter, a warrior is a two handed heavy hitter I think, you have to defeat this character to IS, I'm going to totally remember, I think warrior, I want to do two handed like wha bam, slow down, are you squidding me right now, no you're not, just tuning in, are we actually shocking strongy, I thank you for the five delay lover, I feel you'll be fucking ecstatic cos there was monetising during our celebration stream today, I bought this fricking shocker and in order to connect the bluetooth, it wants my phone number, not gonna be nasty but it's, I mean I know things already have my phone number, blah blah blah blah blah, I like tick tocks in a container on my phone, blah blah blah blah, but it's like no you're not allowed to progress without giving us your actual number cos we're gonna send you a verification code, I'm like a verification code to shock myself, I don't trust it, I don't, I don't think it's right, and it's actually really fucking weird cos that's not how technology should work, yeah I already bought the software, oh sorry I already bought the hardware, but the software is behind a verification code, why do I need to verify with my personal phone number in order to shock myself, so sitting on my desk fully charged to the left, literally shock caller wants to know your location, I'm like why the fuck do you need to know my location for me to go like, I'm sorry to anyone that's severely disappointed, I might buy a burner phone unironically just to fucking use it, right we're gonna go warrior, I like it a bit, what body type bravo is a waman, yeah I'm a waman, wait why is she two-handed, wait her dexterity, her intelligence is ten, wait I want like a warrior beast, do I want a warrior is a dual wheel dexterity built, didn't that samurai, wait so is that vagabond, strength fourteen, but dexterity's not really high, I just want a tank, vagabond is heavy armour, I came from that let me hold the ASMR, you're in for a rough ride mate but thank you for watching I do appreciate it, I do appreciate it, buying a cheap burner phone is it, yeah literally, hero, I want a hero, I can be a hero, oh there we go, I don't want a shield though, I want dual wheels, we'll change it later type, what is her name, oh is my controller dies already please don't do that, my name is, if I'm a two-handed warrior it sounds like I'm really good at giving, guys I'm a two-handed warrior, fondle abyssum, do you guys actually want fondle abyssum, fondle these two-handed, yeah we'll do fondle, we'll make sure you rip and piss, it was a good name, I don't care why I know it's fondle abyssum, right that was a good name, that's what I thought, I have terrible news, whoa, you close it, keeps it, oh that's correct you can get a wee extra cheeky thing, the golden seed enhance sacred flas, imps to do thy bidding, a cracked pot that somehow mends themselves a container for thrown items, wait you can have infinite items, what did he say, someone said get the seed, you would want me to get the seed wouldn't you, I see how you do, I am inclined to believe that gold seed is actually the best thing, five sacred branches charged with the euling power said to originate from the demigod maquela, that's right, not the seed you brought in girl, wait is it not, see, yeah the golden seed, no see, see, he said golden seed, right, base template and appearance, are we even bothered about this stuff, what's that, honestly that's like the color of me, just make the hair black, that's actually me like right now, cause I don't know, let me sip my tea to see if it's cold enough here, okay, oh actually me, a reef lander, a face from a far away isolated land of reefs, wink wink, I know it says reeds but I'm just gonna say reefs, where blood is a familiar say, reef flings, I think that's uh, check it out, whoa, we need to make it a bit bigger, we need to make sure it claps, it was destiny, pale women jump here, how dare you, right, we'll do it, we'll be a reef lander, it'll literally be for real girl, right, and then detail the appearance, what's my voice, are we really bothered about any of this, some folk are bothered, I'm not really that bothered, cause literally the first thing we do is slap some armor on us, so yeah, Fondula has been created even though she's in my image, but look, this goes out to Fondula, you were a fantastic name choice, I'm sorry I couldn't make it happen, okay, sorry Fondula, couldn't make it happen, no, before anyone else, yeah, anyone in Gen2 have a funny name like that, no, no, I didn't, oh can you hear, the fallen leaves tell a story, so crying the great Elden Ring was shattered in our home, across the fog, the lands between rise ye tarnished, I still remember that, rise ye tarnished, now queen marica the eternal is nowhere to be found and in the night of the black knife, god win the gold, who's first to perish, I just start swinging violently, run, soon marica's offspring, demigods all, Stacey Milken, I thought Stacey Milken was funnier than Fondula bosom to be honest, I mean, I guess it is Fondula bosom, I hardly even know her the mad taint of their newfound strength, sorry we're dropping the lore, triggered the shattering oh Keran beat is so good if I had a cs go player, all the names are reserved so, if I get a cs go player I'm calling her Keran beat, I already have all the assets oh

uh mercy's assets rise now, you tarnished, rise now, you dead, who yet live the call of long lost rich speaks to us all oh why the games insist on white freaking screen or a loom, chieftain of the

one, one mage versus like three Rannas, like that kind of thing, it was like three Rannas versus like 18 Elden thingies and like you know like I don't know if you've seen those videos, I just used to watch them and be like huh I'm so entertained right now, it was complete brain rot, Elden Ring brain rot what was your cheat code, hold y and then press the right bumper oh there we go, I was holding the left bumper, wow, oh my god I'm actually a one-handed, well two-handed warrior, oh my god right I've almost finished my tea and then the weathlands, oh I need to get a piece of paper to make sure I make it as fair as possible now before I'm going to start fighting with the accusations in my head, before someone goes favoritism would you rather a streamer that doesn't interact with you, does they play video games with you and does they make an effort to have you on stream, yes or no, no you don't want that, so if I accidentally let someone in when that someone else hasn't even been in, has anyone any fucking accusations, right and I even got a piece of paper I'm actually gonna have to go get a piece of paper, do excuse me for a moment little everything, I don't have the paper well I don't even know so and actually the piece of paper has uh it's actually an old piece of paper that I used to use to track the girl's scripts, do you want me to leak some content because I'll do it right now I'll do it right now oh there's like I could only leak Azur's apparently I only wrote Azur's on this for some reason uh oh hell oh I don't need to okay I gotta live strong anyway she yells please stop shouting I'm getting all hot and bothered yeah it depends on the leakage I've got a plot theme when in August Azur has a giant test audio apparently I don't know if I wrote it or not yet um September she has a reach around for she has bulk worship as well in September hopefully that was well well this little piece of paper says this is a big uh leg bump bumping leg bumping holy shit I

everyone's name in it don't throw that away keep it no it's got information of people that weren't even talents this is old is your uh hyper fixation is cooking do you get favorism that's so specific no no one gets favorism my reeflings are a little squid like looking thing and everyone's the same and you all look the same and no one has any difference and that's the way it should be shouldn't it yeah veal or history is worth millions I'm not so sure about that you give me a bit too much fake now if oh my god that was so cool right so if I use left trigger I use my auto right we are gonna get

hi don't worry torrent fortune is on her side we found her here after all wow that's my one of her kind is sure to seek the elden ring wow even if it does violate the golden order um my personal conspiracy the horses named torrent to make it harder no I'm pretty sure that I'm pretty sure they got proven dev team was like yeah nah cuz we spent too much time on this and love and effort and I mean sorry this game quality well then again Japanese work history everyone works overtime for free so that kind of but hopefully maybe the soft form uh soft form soft wear wear form soft form wear something something like that um okay down on the d-pad to heal uh tutorial area is down here just the like spin on the camera is actually rather strange brave tarnish take the plunge of learning and remembrance recall the art of war and your words but yes I absolutely am going to take this because it's switching items use egg oh my god like the camera's rather old form soft I said everything but what it's called said everything but what it's called catchphrase right wait have I got a man I look badass I go away hold on barbarian women for gentoo and oh my god it's one hit because of the two-handed boss feels good man oh my god yeah yeah yeah garden sure sure sure I ain't garden nothing garden's nuts she's swinging wait hold on I missed I missed I missed honestly Azura kind of already covers that I got a third concept back um which I'm quite pleased with materials and every corner one you'll find fruit and flowers mushrooms and butterflies and various other materials these materials can use for crafting I cannot for the life me remember if I crafted anything is there something back there I think there's a bad guy back there oh no it's a two-handed big boy parry this you little shite oh I love two-handed what the heck what the heck it's so easy you just break everyone's stance and my toes are out this is the best why was that bothering where samurai sorry last time I'm a samurai and a warrior in one I'm a strong samurai oh I'm good to get in bud oh my wait whoa oh sorry I thought I still had a bit of health there oh my god I love two-handed skills and habits

don't please don't think uh me going through where the enemy is at this enemy please do not think that me uh success success but doing the tutorial is actually an indication that things are going well for me and I'll be all right it is not stance breaking charge right trigger uh and right trigger while jumping that's my favorite oh my god oh my god I love it here oh my god oh my god the stake of marica upon dying you will be revived at the last side of grace that you visited however if there's a stake of marica near where you died you can just be revived so if you tell me I'm excited to play

yeah yeah yeah yeah blocking sure sure blocking ah you're not actually supposed to freaking oh yeah yeah yeah you can kill me first time okay maybe two-handed warriors literally always for me because why was that so easy okay I should have been two-handed from the start is the game a bit loud sorry maybe in the fights it gets loud let's let's have a little invest immigration of the audio said that put it is quite loud okay it's now five this is the talking whilst combat and things are being enabled strutting wants to hold it two-handed can I I mean I already shrug it my hands and you know generic length strength oh how do I do gestures again I can't remember is it off on the d-pack no it can't be the d-pack that has to be something else wait I can hold that oh that's how I look I don't have enough for two-handed no refling are you sure my hands are actually pretty small I'm not gonna win in start menu on the right oh is this just oh my god oh my god our journey begins all over again it's amazing isn't it unfortunately we don't have a key to explore this yet but don't think we won't let me put my headset off of it because I think my headset's quite low actually I've got a clip to gesture can I do it already can you guys already come in my game will we take on the horse guy oh rise up my little reef flings oh my god we're gonna see yes oh my god it's been so long it's been so

you are fated it seems to die yeah yeah sorry your words mean nothing to me funny man right where's can I right we're going to go to the church uh but we need to avoid the horse guy because I look all the dead blood as opposed to live blood but I guess blood's only live if it's inside the user that created the blood no actually that's a lie because you can you can put blood in other people that's your blood as long as you're all negative or you're sure the same blood type do you know if you're all negative yeah you have the most valuable blood type and oh wait I forgot wait hold on hold B to run yeah hold B to run yes yes I have a rune flag go to the right go to the right where is he oh right we're in the church see here is the church and here is the people something else and it rains so

replenish your flasks I do like that mechanic adding skills with a waystone knife you can use ashes of war that grants a new skill add affinity with the knife you can use ashes of war to grant affinity to your armor this way you can alter interest curious I'm not smart enough to understand half of the things going on but it doesn't matter because I get to play with the replay and we get to experience when you see her she'd be so in a brothel sorry I said that greetings traveler from beyond the fog I am melana hello wow look at that for the course I offer you an accord have you heard of the finger maidens they serve the two fingers offering guidance and aid to the tarnished hmm but you I am afraid are maidenless no I've got my weapons they're literally all around you women look behind you turning rooms into strength to aid you in your search for the elton ring you need only take me with you yes my lady to the foot of the earth tree I accept then it settled summon me by grace to turn rooms into strength ah another matter yes madam I bequeath to use this ring yes I use it to traverse great distances it will summon a spectral steed named torrent torrent has chosen you treat him with respect yeah I see as I accidentally fall off glass all the time so now I turn my rooms to strength oh my god we're gonna touch my hand rest upon I got my feet and everything for this for a better moment share them with me okay your thoughts your ambitions so what happens if I do strength the principles you would follow strength is just straight up attack and that so what I want to put it in strength we bit of vinegar and a wee bit of day that's pretty little with arcane that's magic faith is low endurance and I need 10 dexterity if I want to upgrade the weapon okay I can do that I mean I can do quite a lot considering how much runes the refunds gave me you need 10 and fit it all into strength I don't mind getting my xp bar a bit bigger the reason for higher xp so I don't fuck it up and then keep de-sinking and then we have to keep calling in more refunds for more reinforcement and bigger bigger yeah strength and dexterity are both attacked just on different weapons okay so I'm strength because of the way I'm handling that yeah okay yes please um what a blast add a blast uh yes add a blast add a blast yeah I don't have enough those things right so now I can pop everything oh no oh whoa whoa whoa it's getting too much from pouch in the main menu you can equip six items to your pouch four of those items can be used without opening the menu just press y in this

I need to get good at the game with you guys, honestly The shock collar is requiring me to give me its phone number to use the software and I'm going to have to buy a burner phone to get it operational Um, or I'm actually probably just going to buy a new brand of shock collar because there is actually no reason why I should have to give personal information to click that on a freaking button of our shock collar Um, are these birds aggressive? No Uh Are we going the wrong way? Honestly. Oh wait. Oh wait. Pick up the thing. Pick up the thing. Sorry. There's a thing there that you pick up That's like, but thank you bro.

I was gonna see I'm wondering. I think you guys might be at the next grace site. Okay. We'll do the next grace site I see your future. I predict you will in three two one Are you spewing on me? What is why does it not hurt me? It puts me asleep Sleep wait, but sleep didn't even put me asleep. It just like did explain Uh, I'm gonna have to sit down because I need to replenish all my class V tripper that's really into divination. Yes. I'm definitely open for that. That's stuff like Right level up wait Wait, did I crack all those rooms? I uh, I did not crack all those rooms. This is gonna be ridiculous. I did not crack Are we ready? You can't get banned for this stuff. It's not that kind of game where they're like, we're gonna ban you, right? Surely not Surely it's not that kind of game that gets you banned for this silly stuff. Yeah, I didn't think so. Oh, no A million a million of pop No, we're gonna be so But it's perfect because that's exactly what I want Oh, this is fantastic. Oh, no, sorry. I didn't mean to use a singular one I don't think it's gonna make much of a difference in the grand scheme of things. All right, let's try that again Use an event Forms so severely deals with hackers in their full game Hmm I guess if you're really into like the multiplayer aspect of like, uh, 1v1 in someone I can see how it might be annoying Are we about to hit 10 million? I think we are Wait, is that 11 million? Hold on, let me do the Wait, am I being Papaga? Uh 11? Oh my god, 11 million runs on our person Bruh Bruh Oh my god, that's like that's insane That is insane. Thank you so much Um, yeah, I think we can go up a few more levels Right, so what did someone say 60 vigor and then strength and then what a few in dexterity, maybe Endurance, I wouldn't mind because I like swinging my sword. This is fucking ridiculous. We're still going 80 strength Oh, we can get 82 strength 40 endurance get that 60 Endurance faith and mind Faith isn't too handed. Am I mistaken? Are you trolling did I read it trolling? And the rest on whatever you plan on the put all the points into faith. I'm lying. Please don't do this Okay, one hit Malena. Hopefully I I think we're gonna one hit her but if strength is Right stamina is gonna go up quite a bit, which is good because I'm kind of like oh my god. Wait I How much can I it keeps going? It keeps going we can max out 40 endurance is a soft cat, okay, so just do that A More endurance Don't get 40 on that Vigor soft calf is 60. Is it? 80 is a hard cut for things. This is the highest level. I've seen someone have Brov literally now didn't even earn any of it You have 15 million you can max out everything. Okay, I giggled it. Yeah soft cat on 60 Okay So we'll do that and then what put in endurance. Oh, no, you said endurance is also got soft cat when I'm like, sorry someone said um 60 and 80 strength So there's not really I have 106 hours on my character in your higher level than it already What can I say the reeflings love support in me?

I don't know like it looks like it's giving up Come on. We need one more world to invade right. Let's admire the nasturtians The reason my nasturtiums are so awesome is they can actually grow in really poor soil quality Something so beautiful can start from uh, even without the best conditions just like a weekend As no one is perfect and you don't have to be You get nasturtiums are like that too And they have lots of big green leaves to get all the nutrition for their pollen Their seeds are actually really interesting.

I thought friday Um, we have aqua the wise and you come we have a mage Interesting interesting interesting Um, and then we have throngler. Have you had a chance at this lovely boss? You have not had a chance at the boss boss yet and you come for rongler We have a clear we have jewel wield mage runny And oh, we've got a little pirouette. Oh nice to meet you. How elegant are you? And then we have second refling that's loading in right now Oh, we have even a polite little bow And then we have throngler the jewel wield melee. Okay. We're gonna see how magic and melee complement each other Oh, you don't need to pray to me. I assure you I will bless you with everything you need in a second Okay, let's see if our reflings can complement one another with two different strategies one with magic One with jewel wield melee. Let's see how it goes. I've got 13 minutes left of saturday. That'll do that'll do Okay Reflings have entered the battle dome magic is taking Some elements. We're doing the moon beam runny approach melee Oh, we are getting sprayed down for a nasty hit. We are locked on to mage until melee refling takes The aggro sort I'm gonna move to the egg But just keep fighting you guys are doing great. Just keep it up speed. You're doing great Uh, we do have Okay, okay. Well, there's not gonna give me anything is it? No, I didn't have anything. Okay We do have are they complementing each other? Can the melee refling keep aggro so the mage Refling can keep it up and just keep blasting and doing that tick damage is the question We are on the second ring of the aoe n i l m n o p attack um So we do have to mentally prepare for what comes next. We are doing tick damage over time We are already close to 50 damage of the boss Is melee magic the way to complement one another? Reflings? We will find out that strategy live We do have a I may have just killed us, but don't worry. I may have just killed us I may have just killed us because I don't have enough class Okay, no, it's fine. It's fine. Oh our mage refling is down is up to melee refling that has all of the aggro at the moment He is debuffed because he is helping me in my game. He does take a dodge for the aoe Oh the area of effect of these flames that are left over is just Overwhelming the power the power of the lord of blood is a bit too much, but that's okay. We're trying our best Take it Okay, I'm out stamina. Well, I tried Completely out of stamina. There we go Okay, not bad not bad it was interesting This is gonna hurt very that was interesting. I think maybe A magic and a melee might be most complementary because if the melee takes the fill aggro In theory should I be doing magic right now? Oops, sorry wrong one. Okay, let's go again Okay, who have we got um, I don't recognize you Ezra income Ezra income And we did just how are you already in there? Uh thigh lord, we did have you have an attempt.

You better say you're getting blessed get blessed get blessed get blessed Okay pre-war ritual complete let's go I'll just leave I'll leave the sword on there's no way I'm finishing the boss off we appear to have a Shield and sword reefling and then a two-handed reefling No, we I see some magic stuff going on hold on Uh my small brain cannot comprehend that if you look like melee That they might have some magic spells up. Uh, there is a gray bar on the H Uh, there is a gray bar on the enemy already not sure what that means But is that going to stop the reeflings? Absolutely not Uh, we do have a pressure Downfall magic that holds an enemy in place momentarily Curious we are at 50 hell max hp reduction. Wow That must come at a pretty price a pretty price of mana indeed Well, the reeflings are going for it. We're raining blood But it's not enough to hurt the reeflings extra careful extra cautious Hardly any damage done to the reeflings at all and yet lord of blood is down on his luck He is below 50. He is doing now To try his best to get any smidgen back But he does not understand as just as Strongies stamina is unending. So is the reeflings for they have the fortitude They have the insight one reefling does go down We are remaining on our two-handed reefling shit Not good Maybe joining the fight I can't i'm out of hp Can it's on your reeflings. He does get a few blood strikes in the enemy is very low. I'm tempted I'm very tempted to swap to the the second grace or just in case all I have to do all I have to do is the tiddly wing Don't fuck it up.

Hmm? Did you think I forgot to ceremony you do you not have lie down? You don't want it? I'm afraid it's not optional. You will take what you get You have been ceremony eyes Uh, yes, all reeflings are helping. Please don't ever feel bad if you mess up or have a little mistake You should use a blessing to get your hp back Maybe maybe I should Now let's see we have a magic sword and play by another and high pre-stess which makes exact sense Considering the name oof is going for the close combat already picks up the aggro from Mog But are is this reefling joe enough to mug mug himself?

No, I can't be a pup tuber and be too h word all the time I can't I can't be a puppy I'd literally just go so silent every stream Right, let's go. Let's welcome boys. Why don't do that? Okay, I forgot I need to level up these a little bit, but that's okay. We can do that in the end Did we just run past or we just perish on everyone? What if it's what the masses well if you guys vote for it then I ain't gonna say no I've got plenty of tails, but I can plug in with the uh be uh streaming out here Um Yeah, if you guys want, I ain't gonna Uh, but I would like vote. Why are you just hating in the bushes? Is that the boost to do that part? Yeah, I'm very open to like an alternative costume that you guys pick just like, you know what you want to see Wait, I need to hold this Wait So then what's that one? Okay, and what's that? Ah, right combination. Sorry Sorry Gamer girl outfit I mean, I've not got it concepted. Uh, maybe only talk about it if I got a concept But I'm definitely gonna stick to like my main Like for a lot. I really like the yukata. I'm sorry if anyone Uh, I'm sorry if anyone's like, you can't, that's weird. I'm like, plus No, no, no. Niveichuber would be here without a little homage to Japan. So I think a yukata makes perfect sense Um but Didn't like it I have to have a bikini only toggle if that's what you're wanting. I mean, yeah Are you and all it uh, that's a very alternative outfit indeed Wait, if you don't come near. Oh, no, they they always attack. I was gonna say he unsheathed his sword I was like, oh, does he not attack if they, like, they hit you? You can't, if it's a great though. Yeah, like, I just thought it was a really good thing. I definitely gonna develop some of my concept art because there's a few... There's a hidden design in one of the con... It's not hidden, but it looked really good and I want to see it develop just slightly further. I think it's very complementary to the hip-hop theme. Um... As well. So I'd like to see that. We are traversing limbry for this. This is getting pretty... We adventuring. I thought you couldn't draw. I can't. We're getting... I get concept art. Concept. Just a hidden... Again? Worldwinds, wolves from the sky? I have to admit are probably the weirdest thing. Wait, what? Is that an enemy? Whoa. Is that an NPC? Oh my god, I thought that was a rifling dressed up. I was like, oh, careful honey, you're hurting me. Careful, darling, you didn't mean to swing on me. Hypno from Pokemon Sun? Okay. Ooh, we're at a new place. Is this where I'm supposed to be going? Whoa, there's literally a growing granada. Whoa, there's a rat! Is that a rat? No, it's a dog. That dog has main cheese with that bit right now. Serious? I got a short sword. I was supposed to have a long sword. Oh jeez, you guys are glittering. Fin beast. Sorry, but you got two heads in. I'm really sorry to say it's because a lot of people put a lot of effort into it, but the clothes are almost useless for now. Oh yeah, no, definitely. I do agree with that sentiment as well. You literally only get to see my face and my hair. Pretty much like 100% of the time. I went reeflings. When v-tubers do just chanting streams and stuff, and they show half their body there, I'm like, yeah, no, that makes sense. Isn't Alexander up there? I know he's up a cliff to the right. Up a cliff. Did I just say what I think I said? Sorry. There's so many of you, it's got me overwhelmed. Oh, I'm to come up here? Wait, let me clean. Are you fighting a dragon or something? Why are you fighting on the bridge? If you think those doggos are bad, you should have seen the Dark Souls one. Wait, Pumpkin wants us to go up here? Am I going crazy? No. Oh, Hypno from Pokemon Cosplay soon. Sorry, I thought you were asking for a roleplay. I was like, why would I roleplay a Pokemon? Are you giving up Pumpkin now, Matt? Do I really want to be a pumpkin? I like my little tentacles. I think that was on the head. Alexander was up that cliff, I thought so. Congrats if your name's Alex, by the way. I just said your name. God, Alexander the NPC. It's kind of a trade-off between copper and shrink and more in the game. Nah, I'm teasing. You're teasing, I'm but- Oh, no. These are the ones where you have to whack the bones. I'm getting out of here. I hate the ones where you're like, there's one and done. I think that's why, even though it's probably more expensive, each of Models and sitting and reclining poses look great. Hmm. We actually, in development, I did entertain that and I would, like, have a, is it dynamic pose? Each of us at one point. Each of us at one point. But then I realized, like, the appeal is, you know, the girls are going to be streaming on YouTube. And depending on what they wanted to do, I didn't know if there was going to be someone who wanted to exclusively just do ASMR streams, because I know some creators are like that. And it was like to get, like, to spend even more on top of what the base price of the Models is for, like, some sort of dynamic pose. I definitely am open to the idea of it, but, like, for me, for example, I probably wouldn't use it because I'm like, I'm a shit VTuber in terms of, like, not using toggles, not doing this, not doing that. So I really would only invest in, like, an all-outfit, maybe. Like, um, Emmy's interested in, like, a straight-up 2.0, which is fine. Um, but, like, for me, I personally had it. Like, I really like my model. Nari made me so expressive as well, like, seriously. I feel like I'm not, like, stiff or anything. I love how, like, I do think, sorry, my hands are starting to sweat. I need to wipe my hands on my hoodie. Ta-da! I'm a sweaty boy. We're going to Radan next to get DLC stuff. Sorry, I'm doing one-handed. I'm trying to hydrate because I didn't realize how much I'm sweating and I'm getting a bit worried that I'm going to be dehydrated. Well, what are you doing? Oh, sorry, my trigger got caught on the table. Wipe your hands on me. Oh, you're pointing. Oh, no! Wait, huh? Am I about to do a boss fight? Why can't I progress? No! Boss fight, because the reeflings can't be with me! Sugar. Oh, no. I don't want to use any stamina. Oh, no, this can't be. I've not leveled up my weapons or anything. Or got more flasks. Or got more seeds. I don't want to upset anyone. Is it in here? Where? Where are they? Oh! Come here, you bum. Come here, you bum. Just because I've not got my reeflings doesn't mean I'm not going to fucking give you everything I got. I'm out of stamina! Both of us are fucking stamina handy. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, let me get the... Hold on, let me cheat. Hold on, let me cheat! Hold on, let me cheat. Let me cheat. I see that fucking thing. I see it. Let me cheat right now. GAN! GAN and save me! Unable to summon. Oh, mother... I need heal. We are both Wacken, but not staggering each other. That's quite funny. Speaking of staggers, take this. Oh, I'm missing. Hold on, hold on, hold on! Thank you. Thank you. Don't ever come around these parts again. Me and the Reeflings rule this neighborhood. That make myself clear. Woman. Cookbook. Of course you got Cookbook flying around. We've beaten them. What is your name? Well, in you come. Jeez, what a name. Is there anyone here who hasn't been in before? I did grab you. You look like an Edgelord McGee. Okay. And you come, Edgelord McGee. See, that's what I shouldn't have named. If I had a Scottish VTuber that I applied, I'll name him McGee something. Or something McGee, sorry. Is there any invaders? Anyone... Interesting in invading? I strongly say for you to get to the DLC station. I hope you're ready for some hard bosses. They have been wiping my ass. Oh, yeah, no. I have been doing very well. If you don't know, I'm actually a very skilled Elden Ring player. I'm actually really happy to announce I did a speed run of it one time. And I placed top 80. It wasn't the best speed run, but I'm actually pretty strong at the game. And I actually do not use the Reeflings at all in order to help me progress the storyline. Salad. I've actually been kind of abusing you a bit, Salad. I want strongy to invade my mind. Okay. Let me bless all three Reeflings that once the Invader Summer comes in. Oh my god, my notes are getting so scribbly. I can't even like... I'm trying to put tabs on like who's been coming in on that. But I have to admit, I've been fucking up really badly. Okay. All three Reeflings are ready. It's... I don't know what hole you're going to get. It's going to be over before you know it. That's all you need to know. Okay. Ready? He went first. He went first. Okay. Let's go. Yahoo. We will now follow. Wait, isn't there a dragon up here? Whoa. I didn't even see them. I'm so blind. Drawstring. Lightning greets. But not to be confused with grease and lightness. Keyleth. Any Keyleth enjoyers? What? Whoa, you look kind of scary. You're not going to lie with your weapons. Look at the freaking distance he has on his. Jeez, I don't want to go in a fight against you. Are you going to whip? Is that a whip? Wait, I need to whip. I can whip you guys. Sheevee sends her regards. Basically. Okay, we're going. Following the Reeflings. Reeflings are following the Reeflings. So we complete the DLC. It costs an extra $60. $60. It costs an extra $60. But apparently it's really good. The Reeflings are kind of splitting a bit. Oh no, we're avoiding that little army there. Who enjoys Keyleth? Question 1. More if you're feeling especially daring. Five? I mean, if you want to get technical six on a Waman. For maximum maximum maximum uh Holy I can't believe I'm saying that. Yeah. For max efficiency is six. If you want to min max a woman six. Okay. I'm just letting magic deal with these dogs. They're terrifying, honestly. They do look like T-Rex people. I do have to give off my hat to the game design. Seriously, like all these different aspects. This game development must have been very long. Six. Yeah, but I feel a difference in quality between the best and worst through astronomical. What about pit? It's not a hole though. It would be nose ears, mouse babina booty and then that's what nose and ears will take another anything. She Oh, they blew up. I thought it was one of you guys doing magic on me. Sorry, the reeflings like leading me on this quest or something like contemplating the uh the true ultimate number was a hole again. Yeah, but the pits aren't uh and it's like a it doesn't have an end to it if you will. I actually thought when AC was actually getting concepts with I'm so sorry to bring this upon you. Um I actually thought about commissioning the ear artwork for her like of her but I was like I don't want to do that if that would make her uncomfortable because I didn't know at the time like what the comfort level of the girls are as far as I'm aware everything fucking goes. Everyone's like on the same page of like if I don't like it, I just won't interact so don't be surprised if I don't interact type thing and then that's it. Ear artwork have you not oh no are we about to show a reefling one of the most cursed things ever? So there's this really famous Neco animation and it's like a Neco girl which has got Neco ears and how am I getting ashes of war? I'm done it. Life steal fits oh you can yank HP as you fist someone that's my kind of doctor your math ain't mathin oh are you talking about ear smashing? yeah I think that's what it's called I guess oh wait, mumbling hold on, hold on I have to take my glycol the ears aren't designed for that no I know but I thought I would beat someone to the chase and do it for icing and if she found it funny she can post it if she didn't she didn't have to do the artwork the concert artists of me and AC together it's not like a major thing it's just like AC is but you guys just think it funny I won't post it yet cause I guess I need to ask her although she's already seen it and she laughed at it she found it funny um tell that to the R34 oh someone messaged like a week back and they were like congrats you

usual and out of nowhere using the front door yeah how dare you I do like the idea of the old bandage the old bandage I like those underwear as well that cover up that section but don't have a section for the back door of the house those underwear are really good one's a crusty bus station something like that there's a good mark of grace over here hold on I'm going to grab it everyone asks howardens but never whyardens oh so when the reefling tapes it's funny but if I see it out loud it's not funny you guys have some attitude on you tonight you know that I'd like to perish okay okay let's go again what are you doing what are you doing to that tree a bandage yes so there's this act of hooting and an empty apple and the apple like you take the guts out of the apple and then you fill it with this toffee sticky toffee like a candied apple and then you put the lid back on or the lid could be a plaster of the sticky apple what thunderbolts and lightning very very frightening oh wait these are the thunderbol flowers oh they attract thunder thunder thunder sorry I was probably terrible I tried oh my god the way Brian said ponzu bit of ponzu thank you broly legend a bit of ponzu I mean I wonder if I could get away with doing a donut thunder word with it see oh this thing's terrible I don't mean a brag or anything but um the cake is so big that you actually even if I

that enemy you killed and it's perfect some weapon when you view it from the front looks like it's the structure of a woman oh I love a bit of fanny inspiration as well not bad I'm sorry I don't know why I thought that was going to be funnier if I said that out loud but that wasn't funny that was just weird I'm sorry I delivered that really bizarrely it was supposed to be a joke but I think my voice was a bit too monotone to explain that I was joking during that I'm sorry that was good where do we no one knows where it goes something's supposed to happen if we're all literally exploring oh no you're going over here right we have a torch that means you actually know where you're going we'll do that I'm fricking too short I'm too small I can't reach wow like robes can I climb the robes

have a torch then it means we're just sending it okay I vote for the clueless squid to leave well the first time I played this game I ended up wandering in a kaolin it felt like part of the section you're fricking mad time I got not resist okay a little bit of parkour in the town don't mind I love what you've done with this place honestly none of you has told me you were stone masons but look at this architecture I mean look at the love and the detail that's been put into this what's happening you guys really don't give yourself enough credit for how much you do I mean look at all the detail

just because we can it's an all weapon am I going crazy I saw that you're a fricking pulp behind me wait am I going crazy is it not like an actual weapon I just wanted to check it out oh it's a talisman my pardon raises attack power after each critical hit but it would put me on heavy load I need this talisman what are you jump attack I do be jumping a lot a critical hit I don't really hit

friendly in this game are you praying to the wiggly worm oh wiggly worm oh my god look at it oh no it's face oh it was going so well for your design that's unfortunate that face is unfortunate the cuteness factor may not have gone down after that aoe a little thingy sorry I'm getting distracted looks like a fight would occur here yep there's definitely a fight because look at this statues and stuff well oh we're getting blessed up okay okay it's a fight in the DLC our first proper fight let's see what happens it's a crypt it's a crypt we've done crypts before it's just a knight I'm pretty

I hate to admit it, but As soon as I get decent weapon I'm literally getting rolled by No We're fine. I'm out of stamina, but we're fine Unlocking your flask upgrade would probably be most important right now drop 99 armor refling can't do that It's a shame, but we can't do it. I was saying that you guys like dropped me so many weapons and armor like I don't even question. I'm just like, oh Refling first What does that mean? Is that unfriendly?

It would have been over I've mained and my tentacle. That's the same you guys are have mained in How you doing it? Honestly, I have to admit this is gonna sound really weird It's actually really funny and like a dog errands. I don't have to think or do anything. I'm just happy to be here Like this is so fun.

The bench between asleep people Handholding is the most fun and best way literally You said it was a noise that you wouldn't want us to hear. No You're not allowed Because once you do it, you can never go back once you brap you can never unbrap Honestly for me, it's not that serious that really What Wait Why can't I progress? They're going for it. I can't progress. Why would I need you guys not to be here? I'm about to do another boss fight I bet or not It's the wall again, I can't believe it three year old be sure to hit the wall at three year old What no refling you can Because you're crossing a boom boundary Uh Uh, I'm gonna get on torrent. I don't trust this at all There's a thing right Can I wait can I just summon you guys like right here? I can so why did it even make you this with the because it's like a new loaded area? That's Pretty plausible explanation That it's a new load in area Grass ahead no enemies. He was just a wee fellow Oh Yeah, background load in shenanigans. Okay. I understand that then that makes sense Because if it wasn't then I'm angry because I want maybe something but if not, then fame I'll allow it to get there. I'm gonna do a little cheeky little cheeky head and load in the screen Um I love Yeah, it's just new can any other leaflings come in Or is it because of something too far so doesn't I don't mean to be an adversary, but I'm gonna need some help. Okay. I'm gonna need some backup I'm wondering I think I'm gonna be honest I think a lot of people might just sleep or they can't stream Because the before the pool was massive But you guys are allowed to break okay, he's don't ever feel bad if you like can't join me or can't get in or anything like that Hmm You can stream snake. I keep putting my sign down, but does that show up? Hmm Sorry, I'm addicted to playing the dlc. Honestly, maybe if there's leaflings that are playing the dlc Maybe that's wiser for when we go back to the dlc I actually don't mind that concept. So maybe keep going ahead for me if that's possible Yeah, the further you go because the difficulty gap is getting massive Okay, no, don't worry about joining. Please don't worry like we just been chilling. Don't you want being chilling? Are you all red so I can spot you? Okay, let's go Oh, I need the blessing. I forget every time that I need to bless you guys when you come in Do you have to lie down? Okay ready steady And I've led you into temptation Wow hold y bumper 200 Pretty sure I just beat the main part of the dlc. So we'll be good. Okay Yeah, we didn't some exploring Is level 42 anywhere enough to help you um in where I am? Yes, actually. Hello Hello Is somebody there? Yes me? Yeah, of course. My name is arena I've escaped from castle mooring to the south Servants there have rebelled I I can't be sure what it is My eyesight's been weak since birth, you see, but I swear I heard frightful howling from all over My good father secreted me at the castle, but decided himself to stay He says it's his duty As commander The accent sounds familiar. Is that a ba we know? I I fear for father's life The servants are full wrath Filled with hatred for every one of us. They've since come for every one of the companions I escaped with They haven't spared a soul. I fear it's no different at castle mooring. Please I implore you Would you mind taking a letter to my father At the castle and my soul wishes that he escaped Even if his honor should be the price, please I just want him to be safe Of the region I'll deliver the layer Dearly then please Take this. Yeah, we'll deliver a letter. Come on. Let's go. Okay Deliver it to my father who remains in the castle if you please. Yeah, sure Ray. Let's go find your dad The castle's done here. What are you? Are you spelling out a word or is this just a pose in particular? She needs some yummy grapes. Don't think so. I mean like the regional accent, but I can't put my finger on it Um, a lot of the voices are actually Welsh Um, I'm hearing Welsh voices a lot in this game Um, which is nice. You don't really get to hear the Welsh accent at all It's kind of like one of those forgotten accents. It's very strong Very very strong Wait, does he not even attack? I'm gonna have to get that pose Uh, this should be re-grapes Are they nutrition? They're looking for me here A morning star and it's literally, uh Jack is me I think I Yeah, believe it's a Welsh pronunciation. Oh blaz Am I beating this up fucking come here Take this No, you're gonna win I've got matey shot. I don't think I've ever seen a crossbow run of this game. I'm gonna be honest It's an I've never seen it if you read the description of weapons and gear these things have a wee hidden buff as well Honestly, don't mind buzz Let me grab this little phone ring here The morning star can get you after every hit. It can heal you after every hit Uh, if my memory serves me correct, there's a horse guy that's ready to attack behind this Uh, bang. Do you have any stone? You do. I'm sorry to see Do you have anything else that we use? I guess if you want to do like a hundred percent Collection, uh being interesting I mean, I have so many souls I can just buy out the shot I Only at night they're called night riders. Okay, we're safe for now I do love a good hidden status It's kind of like Um, I don't know if you guys have ever played this game called darkest dungeon. I've never managed to finish it always gets stuck But I've always thoroughly enjoyed the game when I've played it for like my two hours before getting absolutely gridlocked I'm just stuck at it The game's like, oh your characters are supposed to die. Don't worry about it. And I'm like But if they die, how am I supposed to progress? Because like they're my strongest character type thing And I just find it really hard and like, I know I don't know if I should like mod it or get or if you guys want to vulture it You guys tell me like the best thing to do. I'd probably need to watch a YouTube tutorial though On it because I wouldn't want to play a stream game that I completely mess up like I kind of learned my lesson not to be silly and I was like picking a game that like I have my doubts that I'd enjoy and then play it anyway like Boutro was interesting because I could hear a shot And like it just went amazing like I genuinely cannot wait to play Boutro with you guys again Um, and it was like so nice being able to be like, is this the right move? Yeah, no, that's the right move. Like don't don't worry about it. You're doing great. Like that was so lovely I'll really enjoy that And like I love how you guys are like so non-judgmental about how dumb I can be. Is that a church back there? I think I'll need to oh these things won't happen here. Have I been here? No, I haven't been here Have you thought any more of them? No, we backed off Unfortunately, I've come back because I need to upgrade my my flasks and pouches and stuff because I'm just at a terrible just truly in wholeheartedly terrible Um So we're now back in the limb group area. We're just hunting for sacred tears for seeds Just so I can get a few more pouches Because I am basically getting completely princess carried. I have not done one proper thing Like on my own. I genuinely haven't. We've been here since the moment in and I wouldn't have it any other way I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm literally going. I feel like a dog on a walk That just gets to have all the excitement of showing up at the destination like oh, what are we doing now? Oh, that's lovely. Okay, let's go That is exactly what you want You sold a guy in the belfry well That's debatable considering how many levels I got shoved up to thanks to rieflings putting all their stonk. There's there's soul stonks into me and Donna Donna has some darkest dungeon mechanic and it's a colorful alternative version and the streamer mode has That survived on youtube It's very strange what things will fly and not fly Like one game would do it with a different art style and it's fine. But another game is like not as to work Um, it really is this massive great area at the moment, which is a shame because like I'm sure Now obviously company wants to make money, but that show people behind it I'm sure like they never want their the people that create content to ever be unsure of what the rules are like the people behind the scenes that actually care about like creators and like I understand like hey, this is your income source. This is serious like um, obviously as there is just on her Monetization celebration stream. Hopefully it went well actually. I had no idea how it went because you know I've been going crazy over here for a little bit. Um, but like Basically azura got rejected for monetization But youtube now has an appeal system in place and we appealed it and to my surprise They monetize her and now she has an like an income source now. She Is like genuinely like a full content creator now. She has an income source. She has these avenues like But if youtube denied it then like azura can't even like plan to move out at all like she just has the She would have had to wait a whole other month like type thing. So I have to admit there are doing changes in that Like I don't hate YouTube as a whole because it is a good platform It discover abilities really good as well Not for a live stream discover ability of the live streamer isn't good But if you produce alternative content like asmr short for example that discover ability is so valuable Whereas if you want to compare it to like switch for example, it's just no the same like it's just not hanging Very uh uncharacteristic of youtube too much alleviation. Well, actually I was like, um Uh azura's goobies are like what stopped her but the problem was her appeal rejection actually didn't mention actually gratifying content um So I was like wait, this must be a mistake then because when youtube don't actually give a reason I don't know if it's possible We got reviewed like her channel got reviewed by someone that doesn't like anime Look, I wouldn't be surprised it's plausible And but the appeal went through that's the main thing azura now has a another income source on top of patreon on top of uwu market and And hopefully there'll be something else. How do you guys remember where the churches are literally straight led me straight to a church I don't know how you do that Is this like when I'm like here's all the strats in viva finata you guys like here's all the strats in elden ring I don't know how you do that Oh, they're on the map. Oh Another sacred tear Everyone should be monetized. Yes, everyone is monetized officially on youtube. Um, I think uh Management are gonna do like About it at some point, but I'll definitely like Oh my god, congrats girls like pat them all on the back like Yeah, they did it. They did it There's steps to being a content creator Sorry, I feel time content creator. Oh that yellow fish Wait, where we going? Do we know Follow the light It's just like you in Assassin's Creed brotherhood really impressive So you just shoot off all that info about the game Okay, I'll take it that way then because I'm like there's no way on earth I could remember where the locations or churches are that have sacred tears inside Her voice is so good. They thought it wasn't real Literally, I had to write the cringiest script for her. Maybe she'll find it funny Um, and we could like show it on twitter or something because uh, zura is such a good sport Like she's so down for anything. I'll like suggest something to her and she's like, yeah. Yeah I like she's so that is such a good sport. Fantastic. Um She might find it funny if I show her the wee video that we had to appeal the monetization with Oh, I can put up Azura's meme ASMR now Oh my god, then all of her meme ASMR's are up. Oh, thank the heavens. Right. I'll need to keep that in the back of my mind Oh, jeez. Sorry. I was both listening to her Um Yeah, I can put up her Oh Sorry, I'm getting yawning because I had something a winged size. Oh, that's what that crazy weapon is. You guys are so coming with um Only need to remember 12 churches and forget how many seats along the way I mean, we're definitely freaking getting are you joking? I Wondering why Azura didn't have any ASMR uphills that were in line. Yes. So those meme ASMR's those originally were actually supposed to go up in order to get the Watch time for monetization However, the debut went so well that everyone reached the watch time after debut YouTube just took an entire week to update the stats And then like one after one we did our celebration But Azura behind the scenes actually got denied and we're having to make this like silly appeal of video. She's like It's so cringe. They're like explain how you make content And I had to like type of sense for her to say I am a live streamer I make my content live you can see via the evidence of all my live streams I play video games live like it just got really silly and arbitrary But the silly and arbitrary work. So I'm not even mad um Like I'm just glad they genuinely that appeal process actually works Like as much as youtube bad warning for kind of meme stuff or whatever a great area on ASMR now I'll I have to I have to put my hands up. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean that. Um, I have to put my hands up and say, you know what? We're What's that? Oh Where are we going? I don't think Anyone knows where we're going. Oh, he's okay. He's down there. He's down there Go down go down um I have to put my hands up and say, you know what youtube put this appeal system in place for things that happen and it actually did help us out Whereas old youtube didn't have an appeal system. So Azura would have had to have waited 30 days on top of Uh, what she had already streamed at that point um So yeah, sorry. I have to admit youtube definitely won there. Um With that one, I do appreciate the appeal process actually working The bell tolls for the a better not I need to keep my voice I'm actually a bit worried about my voice breaking a little bit. Where are we at? Oh, no We're almost at nine hours and I'm like, is my voice gonna break before then Oh, no I can feel it breaking though, which is not only Slight problem. I need to maybe not The thing is I don't want to stream like completely monotone But the completely monotone is what helped me not break my voice Hydrate how about I make a cup of tea in 10 minutes? That sounds like a deal Um And we'll get some water bottle and all that Whole ass family, but me's got COVID can I get a good look like it? Yeah, you're gonna catch this shit. I'm sorry Unless you're like unless you have like a separate bathroom And you can just grab like take away food without them like being in the kitchen or interacting. Sorry, you're getting COVID Uh Oh, no enemy you Reslin, I don't think you have to do anything Every slim you didn't have to jump Why are you pointing into it? You're the one who's to go get them It's you two that needs to go get them. Not me. I'm too scared Okay, let's see if we can do it Oh my gosh golly Oh, I love it here. I love it here. What we're sweet. What was that attack? Oh my god You literally said like banquish in the name of the Oh my god, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, not the freaking light don't Oh Sugar right, how'd I get you back?

Is this a portal? Examine the seal. To the left, there's a save. Yes! I remember! Ah, I remember the person. My hair was crazy. Oh no, my scars on my legs are gone. I thought it looked pretty cool. I like that AC has scars. Oh, there's two enemy reflexes. Who's not being around me? Oh man, I don't think I'm being around you. Okay, we are now at East Raya Lucaria State. Raya Lucaria. I would skip for you to do it. I love being like, come to the convention. My A-Bone will prevent me. There's only two that I've actually shown off. I don't know if the loading symbols aren't working for everyone, so I do apologize if you're trying, but you don't keep displaying. I'm not really sure what the deal is. Although I have a slight inclination, and I'm not saying that just because I'm a cuttlefish, that the servers are probably overloaded like crazy right now and are barely surviving. So just bear with me. As I said, I'm going to be playing this a lot until we're satisfied. Would you like to all cower before me? Time for your blessing! All done! You have been left. Now I put the sword on. Then right bumper. No, sorry. Why right bumper? He's whimpering in response. You have an inclination. Literally, I'm like, oh, inclination is such a good word. I think it's a good ASMR as well. Inclination. Yeah. I'm going to do some trigger words that are all related to cuttlefish or whatever. Inclination. I like when ASMR sounds like they're beatboxes and then they do trigger words. It's really funny. I'm not going to beatbox before anyone's like, why would you beatbox? Come this way. Are we just going the same way anyway? If that's your inclination. Do you feel ever that we're so inclined? Your car transaction has been inclined. Wait, that's not even funny. That doesn't even work in a sentence. Pardon. Are you guys in here? Oh, you are in here. Imagine a convention with 100 people in the floor like a starfish waiting for a girl to stomp on them. Sounds like a rifling convention of me or something. I feel like it would be funny though. But it's a wail day and appropriate. I don't know. Aren't you tired? Aren't you tired of everything being the exact same? Aren't you tired of never having the excitement of something new? Admit it. What is this? Why did the tree fall though? Is the tree bad? I would love it. What is launching at us? Something is going for us. I don't know what. Whoa. Am I missing something? Oh my god. What are they called? Trunchions or something. I've completely forgotten what these freaking things are called. But they're bad anyway. A trebuchet. Oh, a trebuchet. It's trebuchet. Not a truncheon. Oh my god. No, I can't hit him. His butt is so exposed to me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't know how I'm perfectly avoiding you by accident. Truly by accident. I'm not even putting effort into trying to avoid him. He's doing it all himself. I don't want to spank the horror. Something is wrong. Oh, that's Gideon's magic. Gideon does that in the Borscht. Aw, I don't think having to compare the thing. Oh my god. You're gone. I'm going to regret that. I'm going to ruin you, buddy. I'm trying to fade off the tiredness right now. What do you mean streaming for nine hours makes people tired? What are you talking about? This isn't even possible. In fact, the improbable occasion three. We're going to the right. Why are we going to the right? Is there a thing here? We're going to the right. Spank the horse. I've got reflexes by accident. I don't know how. I was like walking away from his attacks. I wasn't even rolling out of them. I'm just like, ooh, streamer luck. It'd be funny to say the least seen thing so many lean down. I don't know. I feel like that kind of like fun is like, what are those like once in a lifetime, like fun things? Like, I don't know. Like, I need to try and think of all the arguments before I start arguing. Like, what would someone say about it? Oh, that's behaviors inappropriate. We're all consenting adults. So annihilated. Wait, why am I getting madness? Oh my god. It's the Lord of the Rings tower. How did I do this last time? I'm pretty sure I did do this successfully because I died. And then like, someone would be like, oh, that's so tacky. Like, oh, she's just a Lutuber. I never said I was going to fucking praise the Lord in the middle of the stream. I'm only going to praise him as a leaflin's tentacle. So I don't know why you're getting cheeky. How is this not seeing me? It's so vague. Well, their arguments could be made. I can't think of anything. Are we, okay. We're just walking away. The Eye of Sauron Tower. Yeah. I couldn't think. I was like, where's that madness coming from? Nothing's attacking me. I am apparently getting life or something. I don't know. Reflexes. Oh, I like that. I need to look up all the words that go R-E. And then, like, insert fling into it, basically. Oh, me goes. Well, I think there may be a painting in a shack here. Maybe. I could be a terrible mistaken. I can't remember. It may be some other thing. Oh, this is the Madness Village. I don't know. And it's nothing fun. I hate this section so much. I mean, we don't have to hurt the eye. We don't have to hurt the eye of Sauron, so we should be okay. Where's the other replay? Is he ahead? Have we lost the other replay? I don't see him. I'm trying to wrangle my children. Don't he put collars and leashes on you? Where are you? Are you lost? Am I going crazy and he's there? I'll give you just spread waiting. Hold on. I'll wait right here. I don't know where the heck he is. Oh, he's down there. Oh, you made it. Okay. We found you. What are you? What even is that? Is that that dragon spear that does that thing on the snake? What is your fit? How do you get giffy or looking every time we see you? Oh, my goodness. You look like an elf. Okay, let's keep going. Let's keep going. Oh, you got more clothes. How do you swap a pearl so quickly? How do you know? Maybe you've got it. Or maybe you're just MLG at this game. MLG inventory. Church of inhibition. We'll definitely go do none of that around here. Touch. Great. Thank you. Oh, no. What's in the lady's arm? She didn't make it. Are you alive? Thank you. Oh. Oh, it's my wedding cloak. I think I used to marry Rihanna. No, Rihanna. I know it's another maiden, but the maidens are good, but we don't know this one. Okay, let's go next. The invader needs to leave real quick. The Church of Innovations. I thought we were going to do another prayer again. Wait, is this a fight? The Minish Cap NPV, honestly. Oh, no. I need to fight on my own. I'm so brave. I'm so brave. I can do it. I can do it. I'm so brave. I'm going to sit right here. You should summon in now. Even with reeflings with me? Can reeflings do the honors on spit-roof- reeflings? Spit-roost this man. Reeflings? Get out and spit-roost this man, won't you? Where? Here. Did I walk back up to the church again? Okay, yeah. Here he is. Reeflings destroy this man. Unless I do it for you. Yeah, yeah, nice fight. Okay, that was perfect. Couldn't have asked for a better thingy. I've got a fingerprint. Great. Did you win for her? All right, how do I get an evil reefling in again? Is evil reefling at the church? Wait, spit-roost that man, maybe. Oh, sorry, spit-roost that woman. Okay, let's see. Sorry, but we chairs go again. Whoa, you scared me doing that. I thought we were reinvading that woman. Do I need a tingling? No, I don't need a tingling. No enemy reefling? Oh, where are we? I don't even know where we are. We're in the church of inhibition. If an enemy reefling wants to be naughty, naughty. Are you burying? Or do you have to go? Or are you just burying in general? I have-hello? Hey! Hi! I have-I have yippee! That is a-did you even get any lift with that? Yeah, I really did not get that high up their lap. Oh, enemy reefling. Okay, we're safe to get again. We need not to worry for we are safe. That had big colon ambulance, but not for me. Okay. Wait, you didn't come in? Oh! I'm unable to summon you. Whoa! Whoa! Am I being-am I losing it? This schizophrenia is kicking in. It's not looking good. Are we being invaded? I think they both disappear. It gave me an error. I think you're invaded. No, reeflings. I need to kill her. I need to pretend to be a piece of furniture. I think I am being invaded. I can't see anyone's thing. Ah, same. So... Oh! Oh! I heard it! I heard it! I heard it! I heard it! Sorry, someone's getting-getting right now. I do not want to be fricking dumb. Wait, turn into furniture. Chair. Table. Elden Ring knew my funny prank and said no. Oh no, are you doing a prank? Okay. I'm going to test- I'm going to test the tea. Okay. Are you doing this? No. Okay, I'm having some water first though. Hydration check, please. A reefling. Wait, did I have that? Did I even have that? Or did I not pick it up? I don't really know what it is. This? No, I didn't pick it up. Oh, it's for you. Good night, rest well, both of you. Oh, I've not blessed you. Okay, hold on. Let me bless you. Do you want to come over as well to be blessed? I can't even roll out the statue. Now I'm getting mad to do- I was going to say, did you want me to do it on the crystals? I think that might be out of my expertise range. Perfect. Perfect. Where are we heading to next? Do you know where you're taking me? Does anyone know? Oh, I just straight up killed this one. Sorry, reefling. It wasn't supposed to be like that. But he went out doing what he wanted. That'd be pretty painful. Oh, yeah. Did you not see the fake taxi? I would take the guy, like, tried to jump on the car and slide in, but he, like, completely messed up and, like, really hurt himself. Crystals might be stretching it, literally, and figuratively. Just no one know where we're going. Oh, hold on. Let me open up the map. Oh, I can't because the game thinks I'm fighting. I'm not fighting reefling. I can't even open up the map to see where we're going. I'll let you go. I don't think there is anywhere to go here. You've got to move. Hmm. Is that everything I can pick up? I've sold in, I guess. We're going back to the DLC. No. I don't think I saw that one. Oh. Oh, no. You didn't have to go, though. Is that everything? Um, we would have to do a campaign to get up on top. I think. And we did all of that down there. Caleb has one or two. Did we do Caleb? Not the top part of Caleb, we haven't. Do I have all four talisman slots? No, I only have the two. The crotch bone is the strongest bone on the body for a reason. And that reason is strong, eh? Stop. That's so good. I thought you were actually going to educate us there. I'm like, yeah, yeah. What is it? I don't. I only have two talisman. I can't recall how to unlock more. Go to the church where you find the physics. There's a teleporter behind it. Um, yeah, I know exactly what church you're talking about. It takes you to the top of the Caleb. Wait, that remains. I don't know if I should go and then. Talk to the finger lady at the round table and she gives you one. Okay. We go talk to the lady at the round table. Am I listening to that instruction? How does it feel being able to instruct me to do stuff? Does it? Oh, hello. I don't believe we've met. We haven't. I don't know you. I'm taking a sipping tin of pee. What are you on about? Honestly. Oh, it's you. Hello. Oh, she levels up. Spirations. I recognize. My name is Roderica. I should have told you sooner. Isn't this place impressive? Where the domes for all the little in control. Covert quarters of the two fingers. Whip. Did you know that women actually have 206 bones in their bodies? Would they like another one? Oh, wait. Oh, what? Snow flakes. Relax. Snow flakes. It's called a joke. Right. What am I to do? I'm still looking for my own purpose. Okay. What am I doing here? I'm talking to the furled fingers. I'm going to get your fingers. Your fingers. I just remembered that right now. Wait. No. Wrong area. Furled fingers up here. The two fingers. Hiya. America. Hiya. Oh, you don't want to interact with my thing. I had my doubts. But my look at you. Can you even see me? I've only once before have I seen two great runes together. Look there. The fingers shudder with exuberance. Fine work, brave tarnished. The greater will is pleased. You have earned the right to become Elden Lord. Oh. Now, seek the Earth Tree and an audience with Queen Marica to become Elden Lord and restore the Golden Order. We can do that. Farewell. Farewell. Why? Oh, thank you, darling. Go forth. Become Elden Lord. I like Elden Ring the Bushkush. She's very nice. Thank you, Elden Ring the Bushkush. Hmm. Raise this equipment loads. Raise this holy tack but Lord's Damage Mediation. Raise this attack power after a critical hit. I mean, where are you? Constantly attract enemy aggression. Why would you want that? Or should I put that on so you guys can just go crazy on any boss? Do you guys use that? Is that why he's so... Whenever we do a boss, it's like such a swampy boss. With the power of remembrance menu, you can draw out the power of remembrance magic. Once that power is claimed, it will be lost. I'll just leave it. I don't know what I'm doing. Teehee. Teehee, sorry. The reflings make all the decisions for me. Teehee, thank you for the Talisman pouch. So, yeah! Um... Uh, right. Will we go get spoken down upon by Gideon? Are you ok mate? Jees.

we go all done I had to do a running start on that one uh where are we heading follow the lake follow the lake what the heck is that we're not to be confused with the hit anime monster misumi that was the most ridiculous anime was gonna happen the uh the theme for monster misumi really uh pushing the upper oh no oh this is so hidden you're gonna have to do sponges in only a booties out I don't even know where I'm going you never saw monster misumi long story short solo protagonist adds animal girls to his harem and one of them lays an egg and her name's pappy and I love her hey I was so frustrated during that episode though oh my god wait a minute yeah I knew this was where I thought it was oh my god is there even a save point is there a save point to the right in here if my brain is the guy gonna attack me don't wake the beast behind us and hopefully this guy doesn't attack either it awoken many to lamia I suspect many of the lamia is more because of that you don't fight me when I first talked to you right no you only go a bit crazy later on I don't have a death route okay he doesn't talk to me until I have a death route I'm scared of that gargoyle outside is this can I get you guys to come in okay I can pappy best girl oh the freaking episode that pappy lays an egg in is so frustrating it was like so some guys like trying to exploit her for like being different type thing and like the protagonist wouldn't just kick him out I'm like brav I remember being so freaking frustrated being like just kick him out like I know it's an anime plot and there has to be like some give or give or pull give or pull or whatever in the plot I just remember I'm on a PC you can come join me on PC I'm playing controller because I don't play mouse and keyboard ready steady need to need a little wind up just to really get it going good yeah I've been blessed I like how the music gets all intense and I was like no no you don't understand I'm popping them see he was trying to sell that material hook your head oh I just frustrated maybe are you going are you going for it oops where so you didn't mean that yeah I'm watching you are you are you going for it wait he doesn't get activated until what until I whack him are you gonna whack him first or do you don't want to whack him at all oh he doesn't interact if you don't and oh it's just news to me I thought he always

more like we thought make me extra we got another flask how many flasks I have I have well I have seven eight and I'll wonder but yeah not monster misumi's was kind of like a goofy although I could have sworn about the dvd collection and there's like a hidden scene with pappy at the doctor or something and I remember being pretty shocked but it was because I had never seen like that kind of stuff before I don't know anything I can't remember if he showed her chest or not are we missing raid reefing right he's coming he's just he needs a moment to catch up his little legs are trying it's not fair because you guys are technically on eight are you shadow stepping you are okay no wonder wait so it's not the anim an anime but uh I I think it's called itchy if it like kind of blurs the line not maybe you hear that oh god it's going to be easy oh wait I've got the other cord out ow ow ow it burns it burns it burns okay my flasks actually heal so much who said fight a dragon on a bridge I have to admit this feels very one-sided I can't even get to the enemy and tame okay the wacky little leg I'm doing a hundred pair swing I'm helping I'm helping I promise I'm not going to make

there not gonna lie I'm tired just thinking about it come on okay we're gonna take your time because we don't know how quickly aggro swaps and we're gonna mess it up that's fine look any damage is good damage a whole hundred and fifteen damage okay okay we're gang violence we're gang okay okay we're gonna do it we're gonna do it we're just getting to be a little you know a little move around oh smoke the destroyer apparently over here I'm helping I'm helping fail this I will be wow why is magic so strong that magic felt like it was good is there anything that's even resistant to magic at all? I still move around every day you were so brave in the fight you don't need to move for it all okay let's go grab some refling now that we've done that we don't need to worry about any d spawn you have 19 strength how come how does it come that you don't do any damage I think my weapon's like next to useless is my guess I think I don't I'm I'm I'm slightly unsure yeah after I've made a movie I'm sure yeah okay here we go wait you can come in I think it may be bedtime soon for us you know that we can or do you want me to go for the 10 the full 12 hours or 11 hours and 55 minutes since the vault literally explodes at that mark 10 range we have something to prove we do up to you I'm here for the rage exhausted I'm listening in the same voice all day I think if you want to sleep you can't sleep hmm I think I'm gonna have to change my sleeping time it's the only problem what I'm needing to do is basically sleep as soon as I finish stream and then that means I'm awake and I can record like ASMR and edit a couple of hours before I stream I think I'm gonna have to do it like that because um because the current way I'm doing it is I wake up before stream but I'm so tired after stream so I think I just need to do all my work before stream that's the best thing you lying down got a second layer down here you are yawning maybe sleeping might be on my person a tune hope make sure you're full mass because if you're semi I'm gonna do something that's really gonna hurt we should all go get that whimper coconut he was semi oh that's why he took some damage yeah did you know your pinches can actually break that's just terrible I suppose yeah I don't even know how you fix that can you even put it in a cast I don't think so no impress me then literally it's so funny that we cooked enough why wait sorry I always forget to to have my weapon oh was that full mass I'm even dead in it oh oh you sound like those those vain birdie there's no bone it's just muscle potentially I feel like you I don't even how do you manage that it's a muscle can in theory could a reefing cling flap so hard he'd hurt himself whoa whoa that brani beam she's holy moly magic magic okay as I'm saying I was really interrupted literally if we can keep like if we can keep the boss off of like the magic player I think that's like the perfect job you have what I knew you can't whimper after you want to pay opaline hard tear storm barred cracked here these are elements I think next part solo go behind the tree go behind the tree come on torrent there's something behind this tree we have to explore is it cavern no oh blue stone did the rager reefing do that oh sorry I missed it wow that's kind of scary where are we there's a grease back down here to the left eat get the grass here in some sorry sorry somewhere around here to the left huh um sorry I'm looking out for something towards oh I was perfectly hidden from sight I'm gonna rest because I need to reset my things oh no the first sleepy dragon I didn't I kind of want to leave the dragon he doesn't hurt me or anything and he doesn't mean any harm he just wanted to sleep okay I can't level up that's fine do I want anything new here temporary boost or damage make attack more likely to break enemy's dance move that honestly seems pretty good for my 200 build instead of the deadly restores I mean am I even gonna remember to use it sure probably not probably not like there's no way okay uh sniffling were you my enemy a second ago ah I'm getting all turned around wait like anything coming wow I'm so sorry if I go over you but you've not been in recently I got a bit confused come puzzle to talk to me like I've been I've been memeing for 10 hours now let me make mistakes wow that wants to put me asleep like that nice

blessing so I do I do it right above you sleepy tame blessing and then press what is this it's frost if you're eating a tanker I need to go to bed enjoy the rest of the stream rest well I'll try and do a bit more I actually don't know what we're doing to be honest lead the way we flings I'm really unsure but tomorrow I think we'll definitely get into the meat of the DLC so I guess today was just a speed run of getting set up for it which I'm happy with because I did want to do a fresh save I think tomorrow we actually do the DLC but for now we're just going to try and level up and get ready I see a level up I'm already leveled up can we go down are you hurting those can I jump down here it's kind of an emergency can I jump down here uh you guys aren't budging which makes me think no uh oh

someone was threatening to me creep right now maybe get me people oh it didn't work odd I think the servers might be freaking just an ankle bit there's also different gimmicks that you can speaking of things breaking I'm about to have a coughing fit if I don't hide the movement is the camera it's the camera angle huh is there another refling Hayden oh there is a refling Hayden starting if you need

don't want anyone getting hurt in this uh little arrangement we've got going on hold on thank you you're right thank you for coming join uh coming to member since they're joining membership but it's becoming a member welcome to the membership here thank you very much for the uh appreciate it oh you're offering me stuff oh this is to craft oh I can't do crafting right now because the game thinks I'm in a fight but yes ear mech thank you not the lamb the lamb isn't doing any well I guess they roll and hurt but they don't hurt too much I don't know how you guys are hanging literally I'm ready to pass out I already know I'm gonna try and flip flip my sleeve so I sleep right after stream and then I can do work when I leave off that night shift life helps and hurts me chat is the reflection of a streamer that's my word that word I'm not allowed to say oh that burn arc the reefing endurance finally passed like I like being able to say that yeah I'm a cheeky endurance viewer well it may I get fucking tired too wow that's a lot of enemies up ahead does someone have like an eoe magic spell or fun oh it's a chariot that's why okay hold on why oh let's forget that not magic oh you can't open it if the guys are still moving the carriage interesting I think it would be funny if you could like rob them without them knowing I feel like we're putting them out of their misery because we look at literally how they're it goes through them sorry we're putting these guys out of their misery sometimes it's time to move so on and start working five words before you stream until you move to the phone when you need to move around oh my gosh I mean it's going to be very weird when my dad comes over because the streams are literally going to be like what I consider like a regular stream time um are you good just infinite horse you okay you give the horse a little kiss you make him feel better shrodinger's horse he's neither dead or alive because he doesn't need to move oh are you scared of the horse he's just chillin yeah like it's going to be so weird being like a normal streamer like two ever streams four ever streams what what am I supposed to do so I need my background noise at work hopefully I make more tasks like on that one and just like come out with like the most inappropriate thing ever oh I'll completely miss that no one saw that no one saw that I was so embarrassed for no reason I'm gonna hear them horses doing mannequin challenge I remember that ASMR streams during work you'll have more time to work on your ASMR collabs I suppose yeah basically if I flip my sleep on purpose I can get so much stuff done before stream starts and then also the fun part about that is I can start stream and be like I did this and this and this and this and you've got this to look forward to whereas now it's like I've got all of this to do after which is like causing a lot of yes not major issues like issues for me because I'm supposed to do the ASMR audio like the audio upload today but I'm gonna be honest I think it'll be tomorrow but I think reeflings are like super understanding if it's like a day late all right well I think I think everyone like understand whereas if I flip my sleep now wow if I flip stop if I flipped my sleep now I would be able to do it since I wake up and like guarantee the fails like they're uploaded and I'll be like all the fail ups you know uploads at 9am my time like it's there it's waiting to go I am getting tired but I can do it I can do it wait what about what about the future in audio uh it's gonna be tomorrow I think instead of today is that okay I'm not really like that I'm not allowed to do that unacceptable unsubscribe unless you're reported honestly most inconsistent streamer streamer content crew oh hello you're that big giant that crap hello uh am I talking to your coach right now hold on hmm it's only been a few hours since your last ink what about you you oh you need to get those numbers up that's been two days come on you don't want to be pennant EG hi EG an old codger who refuses to retire is running check your shop so here perhaps you'd like a display yes purchase oh but what one or all of them there's all of them um oh these are infinite ish who did it not snare who's in video did I sniff you I think I sniffed you who didn't ask no but uh is it you right now you're doing it right no refling I can smell it on you geez Katztran even failed reflens in the dlc spot yay man's they even ink and toys per day shocking okay no I ask him to strengthen me I can't do this in multiplayer what do you mean I can't do in multi today watch out there when I'm absorbed in my smithing I lose sights of all else if you come too close I'm up to cause you harm I am after all terribly large compared to you don't know how hard it is not to break anything while I look because you're a giant okay I what are those you got peanuts a weapon did I upgrade my weapon or do I not need to gentle giant are we not doing the castle am I upgrading my weaponry or I'm taking cues from you guys you guys are controlling the stream you're telling the streamer what to do not the other way around we uh we appreciate back back see and then these parts surrounding parts upgrade and then do the castle okay wait something so I can't upgrade but okay uh these things that I can kindly ask you to leave and then I'll summon you at that grace that's over there and then I'll get uh oh no I keep fighting yonza keep fighting on something else strength two three four and I can't do any more but that like

for my oh wait can you guys summon in here so I need the eps the eps we appreciate the back I don't think I can spawn you guys in here but possibly oh wait no I heard that it really takes a whole second to show up the eps soldier of them all oh oh no wait no that looks fine may just look like nothing happened they're only used for multi so craft away okay there's nothing else I'm becoming an eps soldier I don't know if I'm gonna make it I'm not gonna make it read links I'm gonna make it a little bit but I'm not gonna make it oh is that thunderclap you on thunderclap you don't have to ask

we're just traveling reeflings we're ain't dropping no eaves sir that was a quote from Samwise Gamgee from Lord of the Ring well let's take this woman to bed and tuck her in you know you want to plop me in bed after all this screaming she's randomly recording Lord of the Ring she's done for it's ogre well there's an end there's an end there's a merry old man beneath the old gray hill and there they brought a beer so brown the man and the man himself came down one night to drink his so oh hey diddle diddle played their wiefling on the fiddle a jake that would wake the dead as he squeaked in his floating egg within this trend and the landlord tricked the man on the mid oh it's this creepy woman village oh i missed we all miss unanimously our bad chief our bad always in greece starting with on the bright side if you go epitome now you can read into us or if you wait longer wait is the zero still up this land oh well i'm looking at the time it says i've only got one more hour to go so wait we've got a split one's going up here is there a grace point up here yeah she's still alive she's working hard she works hard for the money so hard for the money okay uh and then we go back down oh sorry i forget my flask is like super strong now i don't need to like chug them like glug glug glug glug glug as there's an instrument as long as you have today three streams back to back to back as they're the endurance uh the hidden endurance streamer actually and you as long as she's happy that's the main thing i've been fighting with the copyright system in azura azura actually sings so well when you know how she just like her random humming and all of that she actually sings so well she's uh got been caught by the copyright system who the who's doing this who reveal yourself at once oh trebuchet's are back another seed oh my god there's so many seeds here okay make sure you don't get hit by trebuchet though right i think there's a safe station up here i want to say there is oh no you're leading me this way sorry you're leading me this way and there's something here and they're invented singing so they're actually just yanking it from her so there's an instrument hope her monetization stream went well i don't know what happened but i hope it was good and she was having good time i don't even know what diddle she made she sent me like a little preview like this is what the setup will be like because i was like please be super safe and please don't show anything and please be this and please do that and she's like yeah don't worry i'll show you and then she uh put a she'd made a little love heart with her hand when she showed me the preview of the hand cam and i'm like oh how cute she's such a wee sweetheart on the phone little roma boy oh no what's wrong he's covered in it's okay we won't hurt you it's okay you don't have to be brave all the time me damage bar is coming on i'm getting scared she's too good for you ships to handle she posted the diddles on swear oh nicole tried it oh uh it's a very quick twitter and then i'll talk to myself in a bit to the back her stream was awesome oh i'm so glad she even did me i wish i could have been there to annoy her and be like and i want to request a new happy on the beach in the Bahamas i'd be like that's not doodle that's a whole extra mission i'm like yeah you're right i'm sorry you're right i'm sorry it's your profile pic wait did she like proper doodle at the wazoo i said to her you you might need to be careful like kind of zoom in past something um but i would absolutely love to see more doodle streams i'm probably gonna watch her monetization stream if i have time uh because i i don't know about you guys i absolutely love doodle request streams i find them like so adorable oh look it's a reefling putting me to bed look there it's you see my sword pointing to us for real for real that's what you look like when you pull me to bed uh anyway i'm a simp for a little doodle stream oh i got lightning ram did you beat a ram up with lightning um sorry my brain's shutting down only i'm gonna pretend otherwise running diagnostic three issues found critical failure in the butthole critical failure in the brain i'm enjoying being a bit free unless i have to admit wait where's my third critical failure oh there's a yes hello oh you're oh i just oh look look look look apparently i'm for a reefling right now nightly a reefling well yours uh where are we heading to next i might confess a little bit to the tiredness slowly coming into me i don't remember feeling as tired on other stuff on this and just wait you've got a torch that means i follow you if you've got a torch but you know where it goes you both know where it goes where's the other reefing i'm missing a reef i found the other reefing i think the last years are in the realm of the giants so you'd have to clear marg yet to get there if only i had some mlg pro reeflings uh if only truly okay so then once all my flaws are not our level dot we shall do the dlc and we'll see if we can go back to that guy that's absolutely well within us at least i can heal no that's probably the biggest thing i was gonna be mean in clip i am insent out of my face but i didn't ask you on me did i say that was she in kaolin uh yes we did kaolin we're now moving on to the giants realm maybe true you seem a lot more set up now than i did a few years yes so maybe we could quickly sneak into the dlc just to see what's ahead of us i can't remember even what we got stuck on and we're just getting walloped in general oh i think i'll grab that on the way oh he's so tired we're claiming the mountain plain well we're in a fight apparently oh what's this who or what why are we fighting oh it's you and for the reefling whoa no it's not oh we're not bothering you so don't bother us how about that i wonder what the originals games were like is it the same development team i would be curious i don't know if any franchises ever lasted like that even have the same developers like on multiple editions it's sorry multiple renditions or storylines of the game unless it's like indie owned that's probably the only instance 11 hours did you know memory loss is one of the signs of insomnia just saying not really into anything yeah i don't have insomnia okay there we can't progress because we're looting into a new area but i can see uh site ahead of me you're thinking why why must they go something maybe hunting us then look at the longer sword it's so pointy as well that's dangerous good it's jaggy too so as well i see them just summoning you then some summon them let's discover this and maybe let's upgrade into another class if someone wins some day i have no idea what you're talking about no i don't have insomnia i just i have bad rest asleep at the moment just a little hmm so many things but it will come down to tm oh we can talk to millenials my lady spoken echoes of queen marica linger here as well shall i share them with you yes please and marica's own words hear me demigods my children beloved make of themselves that which he desire be it a lord be it a god but should he fail to become awed at all you will be forsaken amounting only to sacrifices so basically if you don't become something big you're gonna be meat for the tarnished um curious there's a difficult boss up ahead oh yeah if only i had some backup but who have i not had them you weren't in last thing no where's panini in last time you're getting called panini hi i'm getting delirious but we're gonna do it we're gonna oh i'm not had you in a hot second either oh no there was a new one here sugar i don't know if that was someone who's not being in for a while but thank you for your patience at east we are all getting incredibly delirious at this stage i think however we're leveling up my flasks and stuff so we can actually do the dlc area because we may or may not have got absolutely whacked uh oh hydration check actually so i don't break my voice wow what i dropped my voice don't overdo it i've literally got 50 minutes i got less than 50 minutes now okay and first we do our righteous ceremony should it have i got a run up i do have a wee bit of a run up just a little one though oh good i wish i could turn that thing so cool it almost like the base and it's like okay where are we heading follow the stuff like like time to take a new one oh oh i didn't realize there was enemies all over here jeez there's so many lovely flowers though i love it who's that who are you and who do you think you're talking to by an attitude like that honestly being scared of a tarnish are you honestly then you then it even be disrespectful the guy from the braided up here i want medallion greatly raises maximum stamina but come on game team one point look at our sacrifice oh good good good no i'm not yawning it's it's actually just an audio a sensory process and issues oh there's another thing oh there's two golden seats here that's pretty cool uh we're heading over here i'm following the flame they're truly yawning simulation yeah it's just like because of the whole hypnosis thing it probably sounds like yawning but i'm actually just straight up rewiring your brain to do my bidding at any point in time um and i'm actually getting so good that you can't even tell when i'm tapping into your cerebral cortex like i'm already in there the reason why i'm telling you this right now is because you're not even going to remember me telling you so any emotions that you feel of shock of despair there's no point because you're you're not going to remember or feel it again in about 15 minutes time it's a relaxed battle cry that's actually really creative is that why i'm watching you all day every day recently i'm already in we're even done the hypnosis for you well i've done a little someone really complimented my like asmr hypnosis i did by accident when i wasn't like yawning on it whoa two golden seats i guess the game's like yeah you gonna need this touch three stony keeps saying she hasn't done any hypnosis yet but that's all we remember truth is we were hypnotized before debut are you clicking your fingers for hypnosis okay we're a little bit against the clock so i'm gonna have to be good and get going i get going and be good i think this is around the point when you need like six beats for a plaster song i don't know what she's on my head why do you think you're so selfless towards me huh how are we playing why do you think you're so selfless to carry me through the game carry me through of the stuff i want to explore the other reason it's like we got in a i just did three really good what is going on i braped for one second and oh sorry sorry what is you i don't remember going against this did you guys carry me through him last time oh my goodness i do not remember going against that and a golden seat from him too to hike this entire area is a gold mine a golden seat mine there's a pun there somewhere but it's not gonna work in zen structure of english we didn't kill any of these yeah i don't even remember him can't wait for more hypnosis i think on the writing stream we're gonna get a lot of work done on the writing stream but like good work not like boring work like the work you want to hear hopefully it's not boring if it is obviously i don't have to do a stream like that again i don't want to like bore you you don't need every golden seat to max out class you need 30 to get 14 okay that's fair oh you got a 14 flat right however we pick up the next and then we'll go back in the dlc and see what we're looking at what the situation in hand is because i don't know if it's going to be as bad as i remember but maybe we go for smithing stones next or if we just focus and behave and see what happens i'm not going that way i'm never born as always a good thing i feel like when i get sleepy though i ain't i ain't doing my best you know i ain't beating everything out the way i should or like being a gift ball and coming up with like all my my little tangents like disappear because my brain's like i'm too tired to even connect one one real reference or something similar to what you've just read good night wow who's that is he just contemplating like we'll leave him to contemplate make you thinking about jumping don't do it it gets better oh the battlefield wait are we just on a massive u-turn i think we might have the press giant i almost killed that boss but he's still beating me up maybe i should raid into your guys's games and be the fighter although that'd be really hard to stream but it no it's a wagon i remember wagon whoa and air since that attack i'm gonna just keep running you turn to wow life has ups and downs you just have to remember the ups and downs can't be good all the time okay fuck that i'm not even saying these guys i'm too scared i'm too scared i'm just running oh is there a painting in the shot or or anything in the shot oh there's a trader i see him hello is someone there yeah me customer yes well money money money money money no no uh um you get me anything i don't think so thank you hello little horsey i wish you could tell really oh you do a great job i'm working so hard oh the healing and feel the healing and breathe get this score oh oh oh got it oh you don't like my little my little hip lamp look at that boom you're like that come on that's cute where are we heading at uh okay the cookbooks are always worth it even for dumdums like me that don't cook oh that's rude how are you even aim ball and i'm moving about the play it's a quest time for later in the game oh i didn't know that uh right jeez you're going really far ahead when you're gonna go out of bed i just run past them all honestly some sections are like that actually this is controversial and no one's gonna like it uh do we have to make sure we don't freaking congle line into an arrow hold on wait i might actually have to use my brain not to perish here oh he's he's doing deforestation no no no that's the one that's the one mate wait why are we skipping him why are we skipping him is it better to do the arrow guys wait arrow guys first question mark right arrow guy first because that's ridiculous let me re let me get my stamina back and take this and that and this he's going over sorry okay i'm okay wow uh sages cave has one in the altos bless you thank you oh sugar okay we have buffs we have buffs we have buffs so third guy can't even get ahead and he's getting staggered beyond belief it's hard to tell him to listen at all that's the only thing we're all ganging off on an enemy that's right take it uh uh uh that's right take it uh uh look good look good what do you mean we're super over leveled and shouldn't be surprised that we win these phase don't mind don't ruin my buzz we're just having a goofy goober fun i've torn on speed dial okay no there's a save station gotta do the inside for the last palace man squad oh okay we're getting upgraded okay do i get to summon or do i not get to summon those questions oh we don't someone's here okay i'm totally not supposed to a little bit but we'll be nice and quiet so no enemies locked on oh he's very quiet here's an author he's gonna pick this up clearly yeah i would like to call in the reef lens robin in my face i think we're in trouble we can't go back all right there's a few enemies let's just keep our going can't call torrent because that would be too easy no they don't go there oh my god be laying in it be laying in it okay we're safe i'm gonna go like we're making dinner okay continue keeping moments safe don't burn yourself making sure it's so dangerous archive yourself when you're talking to this one no go to this is the castle rampart is this no go through oh wait should i rest i should probably rest again oh hi melena my utmost thanks for bringing me to the base of the urd tree you can come to the base of my urd tree any time thank you thank you still got it i shall depart to ascertain the purpose i was given farewell i shall leave torrent right and the power to turn into strength one here i'm actually i don't have a clap i wish you luck in realizing your ambition you have fought long and hard i have no doubt you will become elden lord yeah you believe in me may you take the throne okay last we can have one more two more flasks from i'm unstoppable i'm just a hp chugging machine the soundboard audio is doubled oh it comes out of desktop and stream thick thing there's only one reefling that can able to do this at the location did i miss the map i've i'm not discovered it yet it must be up ahead wherever the heck i am i can go i'm gonna just wait okay i wait put away put away i don't have any interest in i'm gonna change what do you want is it nice i like polite by both to be my sin if you're at disadvantage anything the girls do it's all me it's all me oh nothing oh i guess people at the end game can't get some in here wait really i just woke up and you're so going god you're so precious stop it reefling you're precious do the reason why i have strength oh sorry wrong one i think you're the only there's only one more reefling that can make it it's because the city changes after the realm of the giant it's not looking good i put down a sign is your password every time look i gotta bless the reeflings before i send them in oh no i think the game's really limited you're gonna have to carry everything reefling like no pressure if you're the only one that can load in you have to carry this entire section i guess if we burned the tree we would actually be in a different area oh no okay we have a second reefling i don't know if any invaders can make it i don't think so i think everyone's cooked so we need to try and get through this area as fast as possible without being invaded somehow i'll literally we need to do as fast as possible are we ready oh wait no there is a reefling there's a reefling that can be the invader oh my god we don't have to like panic thank god i'm getting nervous i'm getting shaky this is the east coast patrol rampart look at my cloak honestly i need a quilt creature right now i'm so down for our quilt oh we're safe we're safe we don't have to worry about people beating us up right are we ready reefling i don't know where we're going or what we're doing but let's do it let's do it a quick adventure try a minute adventure reefling i'm guessing if we go this way open the door it does not do a single thing like that okay we're beating up snowmen we said global warming rid of them snowmen right now i got 10 no i got one 10 i can't bring which is easy oh he's a chicken nuggy he's got knee arms knee legs and he looks in the castle oh my gosh this room's gorgeous look at all the plants it's just like the farm food thing i'm gonna have all these plants around and then when you come home tired from work i'm going to tell you all about my plants and you're gonna be like god she's so dumb i want to fight her and it's the good life for her oh oh no reefling reefling quickly quickly so you don't take fall damage okay that was good reefling the sea collection grows capital area so i think because it shows like mild civilization in between like all this death and decay uh possible because i always wonder i'm always like how how do people travel in the roof and stuff in this game because isn't it too dangerous for the average person because if we're having to do all of this stuff or is it the average person like everyone has to learn like some sort of skill or craft and in order to like go anywhere there's no cities oh sorry sorry but it's oh sorry am i gonna just wall try something oh i think i'm not very uh this is magic unfortunately that's happy being those games are always basically supposed to pull off everything's falling apart not to stay for anymore um okay i'm gonna say like how do you people eat like i don't see any farms the carrot is growing aren't you guys hungry like who sits up the food does anyone even eat does anyone even need to eat maybe it's like a car okay you guys have split one reefling two reeflings are gone oh there's a fight hold on are we fighting or are we okay we're fighting we need to help that reefling don't wait you carefully dodge that uh i will say i pressed b but i was already locked into the big boy animation okay i'm sorry i just blocked you okay when they're taking a critical you actually can't there's a guy on the stairs as well over to him where are you going oh this grace had a lot of problems i don't think i can summon you guys properly after that i feel like run through this whole area on my own it's not even in some big on my own i had to run through this whole area i'm scared there's actually a lot of areas in the like later game that you can't hit anything wait oh there's an enemy there oh no sorry they weren't even attacking me oh i feel bad for them hold on i need to get my stamina back stop it stop it i need my stamina back before i can start swinging you understand oh i need my stamina shit oh wow stagger time that was awesome pillage corpse yeah i will pillage the corpse we made it oh we're going up okay let me grab something something here the rag and wind oh i remember oh my god how do i not even see that when we entered did they like perfectly hate to view this i feel like when you look up you'd notice like a dragon's empire like it's got the old scale you've already rune art that helps me in fate oh no we're running out of time hmm i've laced in 25 minutes when it seems like i'm going to be dead please don't fall off the map do you mind don't hurt my wraithlings don't give them jump scares either that's not nice i think we can keep going okay there's a bit of a fate do you not have kills okay oh i see the seed i see the seed right let's go wait do i take the seed i don't fuck let's go flying it's going for my bullsack have you gone no it's targeting me and i'm in a corner this is a terrible idea i i just healed the undead i like welcome welcome welcome oh wait it's a week i'm so happy here okay we go to seed there we go uh whatever do seamless co-op mod um i would have to do it with one of the girls because i think there's ip issues if i did it like that whereas when doing it this way it is through and it's through the servers which keeps me safe as strummer oh they can jump i was like haven't seen you over here they can jump it's not i think it's not a crazy concept that any of you can jump but you did see here it's we are beating up these plant men i suppose it's mushroom if it's the score it's not plant them oh no is there not a save point no there's only a save point after the fight is this a solo fight seamless yeah i was going to do seamless with sin oh no right i don't know if you guys can come in i hope you can oh thank god i get so nervous um i actually like his attack pattern because i have enough brain power to like respond a little bit now i know i'm getting walloped don't get me wrong but do i need to bring him in the open i think we need to bring him in the open a bit he's like really swinging weirdly in that way which i think they're like hitting us so well okay it's rolling pit okay hold on oh he changes like the last second oh wow i feel like that's going to when he's lost on the ground is pretty cool play safe and heal again oh i said i'm gonna play a safe and heal again oh my gosh okay god free has been banked there we got it i got poachers thank you replays okay what can we put on we just put on the critical hit one because it probably got gone right now are you coming out no the game's just yeah i was gonna say the game's just slowly kicking you out the spawns you're tanking i'm literally just tanking all the hits it's a lovely ds on this sheening i just connected to the very last second i mean it worked out um can't what what do we do now did i just talk for the last bit i don't think we have enough time to like achieve anything do you have time for margot only if you guys can like fucking bum rush them do you want me to go is it this way i'll go to get margett up on those stairs i don't go there oh no my bavish goes up past the way up to you i guess and i can't spawn you guys at this one up the tree branch this tree branch right here let's see if we have time i don't want to corrupt the vod though that's the only thing it annoys me so much all the babushkas there's a wee bastard ahead i remember him do i have enough IQ to kill him right now i don't know i don't think i have enough is that great can i ignore him wait i can summon you why corrupt the vod um for some reason if it goes at over 11 hours is that all you've got um for some reason after the 11 hour mark the thing 11 hours and 55 minutes the vod becomes corrupted even though you can still stream appropriately i could keep streaming past it and you guys would see it fine but if someone comes to watch it it doesn't like it like at all wait is it is that someone over there riefling why are you all the way over here is that you it is lol why are you all the way over here okay you think google would have done something about it so many years ago okay okay you guys are gonna have to like wipe him out we've probably got a few attempts maybe what three max does the other person get in where's he not bringing you in i think the loot doesn't work saw the blood on me depends on how fast i die that's my secret cap i don't go anywhere near the enemy unless i have to okay there we go two reeflings it's time you need to prove thyself youtube already a huge money thanks for google and the stores were told our vod would make it even worse for them well we need to specifically request that we need to be like hey are you guys ready let's see what happened oh wait am i going to get cutscene oh yeah i was gonna say i have not unlocked the cutscene yet because i've not done this guy yet graceless tarnished oh is it his voice our hair that was so disapproving of me what is thy business with these thrones become elden lord ah god rick the golden the twin prodigies michela and millenia general bradarn prytor righard luna princess runny willful traitors all thy kind are all of a piece we're all the same pillagers emboldened by the flame of ambition have it rid upon thy meagre grave f felled by king morgott last of all kings uh hi i've forgotten everything you do and your taming i've forgotten your taming okay the reflins are coming in clutch i've completely forgotten his timing and everything okay i wouldn't mind going for a cheeky wallet though okay make the rain make you stun us in oh i missed it i missed it oh wait i only have one healing cost wait did i not i forgot to lie down uh reflings you might have to do it between you i'm sorry i'm just gonna cover behind the chair but mind me i forgot i i i'm i'm gonna cover i forgot to heal hitting him what orbel and moon okay that went really well that went insanely well freaking first attempt thank you reflins that was fantastic right oh he he's drinking to the occasion are we celebrating okay that went freaking fantastic um is there like a i don't know if there's like an interaction that comes up well literally reflins coming in clutch right i think we interact with this and then we get a safe station down touch the wall of thorns impenetrable thorns refuse all none may enter the urge tree i don't know i have red eyes i'm watching you i've probably got blood in them to be honest okay i can't do anything about it i think melena is going to tell me what's up and i need to basically i will sit down because i think she needs to talk you know or i need to talk to her hi darling hello again old friend allow me a moment to converse with you you are unable to enter the urge tree no you're prevented by the mantle of bars the thorns are impenetrable a husk of the urge trees being that spurns all that exists without the only way to stand before the elden ring and become the elden lord is to pass the thorns my purpose serves to aid in that very act so i'd like you to undertake a new journey with me to the flame of ruin far above the clouds upon the snowy mountaintops of the giant so i can't remember i can set the urge tree a flame she still stays with me after the burn to becoming elden or am i being dumb she doesn't say with me after the burn uh shall i turn your rooms to strength maybe let my hand rest upon you now for her to wait a moment share them with me your thoughts your ambitions the principles you would follow you have to like chaos take the world and burn the tree that way but she's unhappy if you do i don't want her to be upset with
