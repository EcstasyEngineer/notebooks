0	12000	so
15440	20000	someone goes about a vice of i'm my reaper with my conflict
20000	34640	Of course I see one she hates comment as I'm in the the click go live section whenever I go live
34640	36640	There's like a
43040	45520	Oh my short went up
48040	50720	Oh, Moe short went up. Oh my god
55800	60940	Hold on a minute hold on a minute. I just approved the release. Let's call me and hold on a minute
64720	66720	I wasn't supposed to have
70200	77600	Good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon. I'm currently in my YouTube comment section. I think I just had approved in a sus comment
78360	80360	That I may need to get rid of
84920	90360	Sometimes I actually approve a comment and I'm don't worry like I'm not insulted about it
90440	94160	But they mentioned another time that I was green and I'm like
95240	98440	I'm strong equals. I'm green. Let's leave it at that
100360	106120	Give one and get even good afternoon. How are you? You will give a rebee debris. We know we be you know
110760	112760	I did it
112760	114760	I
122160	127800	Had a short that came out. Oh my god, congratulations to me
129600	131600	And I
131960	133960	fricking
134560	136560	Finally I
136920	144080	Finally have a short and then I have a short coming out in four days and guess what I've finally edited the most a collab
144640	146640	I did I
146960	151760	Finally edited the most of the collab. I just need some title it and then I get up load it
152560	153760	and
153760	159320	As there is meme ASMR should be up right now if I'm not mistaken if I schedule that properly now
159320	164120	I do have absolutely horrific news and it's bad news for everyone across the board
164400	168320	So for those of you who weren't in the stream yesterday, please don't worry
168320	173760	It's absolutely ridiculous for a streamer to ask for 12 hours of your time. I am not insulted if you do not know this I
175600	177600	purposely took
178600	181960	Medicine to put me to sleep as soon as I went off stream I
183440	187920	Ended up staying awake another like what four hours
188760	193880	Maybe even five so I'm back to being exhausted didn't fix the problem
194120	197560	I woke up ten minutes ago. I'm shattered
198360	200920	But I think I can make it happen
205880	208600	Did you like the meme plot for and
210040	217480	If you haven't seen as there's meme audio is up and she keeps you dry with her boobies in the rain
217800	220200	And
220200	227800	Right today we're doing Elden Ring part two and then next week when next week starts. It's Elden Ring part three
228840	234080	However, I don't know if there's gonna be a pushdown and stuff if so
235560	239400	Baltro will be an Elden Ring stream most likely and
239960	246200	Mecha salt will be wrecked as well to make way for Elden Ring because I don't actually know how much
246280	254280	Contents up ahead so when the game says DLC my brain goes. Oh, it's something. That's 50 percent shorter than the main game
254880	260400	But some people are saying no this thing is who you mongous you mongous what?
264680	268960	So yes, it goes Elden Ring part three and then I do an AS the more stream
277160	280600	That's not my thing yeah, I
282720	285040	Fuck up that's not right
286280	291040	The ASMR stream should be for you. Why does it say 2 p.m?
292240	294240	Unless that's EDT
294680	299040	Sorry, I'm gonna have to change that and my my delirium. That's not right
299760	304960	So it should be 4 a.m. ASMR stream at the usual time then two hours later
304960	309080	We're gonna do two hours of script writing. I'm gonna gauge interest
309080	314440	I'm gonna gauge if people like it if people like it. We'll come back to it another time and then
315160	321240	I've been among us collab with Yumi plus and it's gonna be a zero mercy
322120	326440	She be and me versus in quotation marks Amy Mamosa
327440	331080	Rainy what the fuck that's about her name wrong. I
331840	339040	Have oh my god, this is what I see this is why you can't fucking make anything creative when you're like delirious
340440	342440	and
342480	349400	And then the next day supposed to be mech assault campaign mode mech assault is an old ancient xbox game and
350400	358240	It apparently is eight hours long and then I'm gonna make a membership ASMR after the eight hour stream
358640	362920	The time zones are right. They're in EST like the rest of your schedule
365320	372160	But where does it say that it doesn't say that is an EST that's the problem
372160	374160	I
375640	379240	Shouldn't know have like yes 9 p.m. EST and brackets
380200	381920	anyway, and
381920	390120	So if Elden Ring is complete then we're playing about row if we're not playing about row and mummies gamble in the house
390640	394240	Wait, yeah, if we don't if Elden Ring is finished
394720	399120	Then we're playing but we're gamble in the house. Look at the right side of your schedule
403160	408920	All right, but there's three different time zones mentioned on it
409640	411520	so
411520	413640	So people are to go the first one
416000	421480	Am I missing where it says all times displayed at EST I literally cannot see it
421480	424680	I'm looking everywhere that you can see my freaking pupils
425280	429160	Looking around I see there's three time zones in the right column
429360	432840	But then in the actual schedule is just picked a time
433960	435960	Where?
438120	441360	You know what the fun thing is you guys are never gonna know what the offline
442000	446760	Ed it looks like of my schedule. I was giggling away
447520	450920	Cuz em Emi was being a cutie pie and
451600	457560	Then I was like wait no one's ever actually seen the offline mode of what my schedule looks like
460160	466600	Ed no starting right binding of Isaac for two hours. I doubt it. Well, I
467680	470800	I'm gonna need no because the problem is
471600	476880	Runescape part wait runescape part four doesn't tell everyone to download the movie
478640	484840	Right, so runescape part four and part five. I'm gonna try and finish cooking in those two
484840	486840	I don't know if it's possible
486920	490520	But in runescape part four we're watching the John Wick series
490520	495560	I know I said I didn't want to watch it, but I had to basically I
496120	499120	Couldn't find any other trilogy that I wanted to watch
499560	504080	So then I said no we'll do that and then in runescape part five
504360	506920	We're actually gonna sit and just watch
507520	511440	The girls is live streams because I can't keep up with them
511440	515920	However, I can keep up with them if we can watch them whilst we do runescape wine
516600	522800	So on the last day, I'm literally gonna sit and watch all the streams that I wanted to watch from the girls
522920	527280	Okay, each girl I'm gonna pick a stream where I'm like, I'm I want to watch that. I'm I want to watch that
527280	529280	I'm I want to watch that and
531040	538040	Cuz like I really want to watch as there is monetization stream. I don't have fucking time like when I finish this
538480	539680	Um
539680	542800	What is it called when I finish this um um?
547000	553840	Endurance stream, I'm literally gonna go and put subtitles in the mimosa collab so then it uploads
554760	556760	Before I stream tomorrow
558360	559640	Oh
559640	564840	Yes, John Wick is one two and three wait. No is the fourth movie already
568160	570160	Oh
570440	575920	Right, I'll edit that before I tweet it because I just want to watch John Wick one two three
575920	583080	I unless for I don't know how long they all are sometimes movies are like two and a half hours and I can't do that
584120	591520	He shoots his pufusal. Oh my god. It's already out. I can he keep up the fourth one
591920	594520	You said there's a fifth one in production
594600	601560	Bro, he that man a break let that man retire wasn't that the whole plot line that he's fecking retired?
603920	606880	Oh some of yous have got a cheat honestly
607600	613600	Making same one after same one after same one nothing but a cheat around you. Oh wait. No, I can't go in the middle
613960	615960	I go here
616960	622160	Whoa, yeah, I always forget that I
623400	625400	Always forget that
627280	629280	Force one is
630240	636160	169 minutes long, so it's two and a half hours and they didn't wrap it up in two and a half
636760	638760	I
643640	651780	What's the plan of action I've no got a clue I think we're going back to the DLC I have a tonne of flasks that actually heal me now
654920	659880	The irony that you speak about break for what force is the last one all right
660640	662640	I
662720	664720	Spoilers
665040	668800	Right, okay, we will watch John. Wait, I thought someone said John with fibers in production
668800	675020	I'm like what fucking like hands is gone to like some some kid and be like take take on my legacy
675020	681000	Where I just annihilate everyone and I actually only shoot how many guns are physically possible in the chamber
681760	683760	I
684200	686560	Did you upgrade your weapon not quite?
687240	692400	But I do have to acknowledge that the refunds are carrying me through everything
692640	699200	It's just something like that. There's a bit. No, that's how the fifth minute. There's five offer fucks thing
699200	704360	I'm gonna have to change my movie choice. What is a trilogy or some sort of movie?
705120	707800	scenario that all from the same thing
708720	710720	That'll give us like ten hours
712000	714000	roughly I
714320	719160	Need ten hours so we can just fucking wine out max wine out
719840	726360	No, I can someone said spider-man. I might just do spider-man so we can all laugh at the dancing scene
726880	740520	We should watch one piece. Are you John? I'd never be off stream for how long?
741520	746380	Yeah, Toby McGuire's big Spidey man. I might do that. I
747560	752800	Would say shrek one to three, but I didn't like the third installment. I think it's shite. I hate it
753040	755040	and
755360	756640	Fortune load
756640	763280	The reason why Lord of the Rings is out of the question or the Hobbit is because I'm doing it on Christmas and I'm doing it on
766160	771400	My brain won't hold on let me drink my tea. Hold on. Let me drink my tea cuz I'm clearly not awake right now
783800	789760	Christmas what you plan that forehead? Yeah on Christmas day. We're watching Lord of the Rings and then on Boxing Day
789760	791760	We're watching the Hobbit
793280	800120	Maybe the final destination I have a really big fear of flying and I can't really watch
800720	802720	Oh
806920	812640	Blade is through movies is play those vampire ones. I don't think I've seen that
815400	822520	Boxing day is the day after Christmas. So the 26th of December so 25th Christmas 26th is
823120	825120	Called boxing day in the UK
825720	830320	It's where you put on gloves and you're supposed to box someone that you have
831000	836440	Like negative feelings for but it's supposed to be done in a comedic way and then after I'm fucking with you
836440	840720	That's absolutely not what boxing day is but boxing day is on the 26th of December
840720	844240	I think it's a retail shopping thing
845840	847840	Blade yes
848840	854080	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I couldn't help it. No boxing day is a thing
854080	859680	I think you're in what statistically what I recall is that it's supposed to be everything's on sale
859680	862840	So it's just another way for the
863240	868600	Capit the cogs in the machine to spend all their hard-earned money
871840	877160	So boxing day yeah, just like so you can start the new year fresh. You just have a little go at each other
878720	880720	That's terrible
884080	889360	What if shadow of the earth tree it was shadow of the freak tree and instead of playing the DLC we just
889800	891800	Played with each other and go
893560	894960	Okay
894960	896960	Very interesting
897160	900520	Are you gonna reimburse me for the DLC then if we do that?
905080	907400	I have no idea what I'm doing
907920	909920	Ah
911480	913600	Who's leading me who's what we're doing
914280	917760	When you get picked up by cops tell them strong I told you so
918320	920800	Everyday is boxing day. They should have seen this
921560	927520	Sweeper pulled off yesterday a TKO double on shorty. All right then all right then sirion sirion
928040	934400	Actually, it was a servants Christmas the people were who were on staff for Christmas parties and fees
934400	940360	But actually exchange them on boxing day. I think Poland do it. Is it Poland do it the day before as well?
944360	947120	That could just be making utter pish up. I really
950080	953840	Um oh my god, I don't have live chat on no
954400	960760	Didn't miss how many messages. I swear. Why is freaking talk chat even a thing on YouTube?
960760	964840	I want to see all the all the terrible remarks
966080	969920	Right, I'm gonna be honest my socks are full
969920	971920	Oh
985800	992220	My souls are just being cheating don't you want right where we're going stage front? We're gonna see
992720	994720	You're ignoring us. No
996320	998320	I'm supposed to go around part. I
998840	1004400	Didn't even know there's a difference so basically it goes like wait a minute
1007360	1009360	Can I hear the enemy?
1015680	1017680	Hear the enemy I think
1022680	1025240	I don't know why I can't remember why I turned it down
1029040	1031040	Are we deciding on a challenge?
1034120	1036120	I can't do it right now
1037480	1039480	Are you squiddling me right now?

1226880	1231440	Wait, what I've looked at or generate as men golds audio is very loud
1231440	1233440	Which is causing some of the viewers to just

1408380	1413540	My gosh, I think I'm gonna have to get some sort of magic spell so I can
1413740	1420260	Commentate and help briefings instead of like I wanted to do a two-hand. I've never done a magic bill before
1420260	1422260	I
1425220	1427220	Didn't know he had lightning
1429060	1431060	Honestly, it's kind of frightened
1433100	1435940	Leave that refling alone shit
1437220	1440900	How am I running him? I don't know. I'm just outpacing him gently
1441260	1443260	I
1447940	1449940	Think the enemy honestly
1451740	1453740	Okay
1454060	1456940	Wait, that was just things
1459300	1462420	Hit from a distance oh my god
1464220	1470340	Bruh, okay, I thought I'm starting to understand why people may or may not have done the DLC
1470900	1472900	That was like hard
1473940	1477300	Who wants to try it the reef oracle
1478660	1480660	reforeacle
1480700	1482700	Foreacle me mommy
1484300	1488380	Now please don't worry, I'm not actually putting your name down for any
1489020	1496360	Main game stuff like when we go adventure in this your name does not get tallied against any like a walk around stuff with me
1496360	1498360	I'll finish this piece
1499240	1501040	Oh
1501040	1503040	Lovely
1505440	1507440	No, did you not come in
1508200	1514120	Yeah, but you clearly have better connection right we have a bleed build from the looks of it skinny Molyneke late
1514800	1518040	Bleed build and then we have a and second
1520280	1525560	Maybe we have some sort of magical staff you guys want a little pre-war ritual moment
1525960	1527960	Can't send you in a battle now without
1528680	1530600	getting your rewards
1530600	1533160	surely if you're gonna defend the house of
1534600	1537440	Strony you get what's going to you
1541800	1544940	Well, oh cuz I was in the jump animation it didn't like that
1547160	1553360	Guys don't look I'll die immediately. Thank you. Right. You're ready. Yes, steady
1554360	1559080	You be have to do some clips. I'll literally just like my IQ
1564400	1568240	Okay, he like loads up quite a bit
1571000	1572120	Sorry
1572120	1575880	I'm just trying to like get a feel of his attack pattern
1575880	1581320	He seems like slight delay, but he can definitely like do a back kick into stuff
1581720	1583720	Which is quite curious
1584440	1588360	Yeah, but he can turn so quickly as well. This is I
1589480	1597640	Must say this is a fantastic boss. This really is the design his capabilities. I've only seen phase two, which is lightning
1598640	1603440	Yeah, this as well. This is a nasty amount of work nasty nasty
1604280	1612880	But I love it. I have to admit. I love it. It's like a whirlwind type of whack again
1613040	1616920	Yeah, see the effects of that is fantastic
1618200	1624160	Don't worry lads. I helped for 200 damage. I really did. I really did. I cannot imagine
1625080	1629200	Anyone playing this solo. Oh my god. It's cheeky little spank on his butt
1629880	1634480	He it's because of his a bit he's free and he's free and
1638040	1641840	He's a male he's a Tom cat. He's a male Tom cat he's free and
1643160	1646640	Okay, I got 400 on them there. I'm so good at this game honestly
1650840	1653040	Wow, wow, wow, wow
1660040	1661280	Oh
1661280	1664760	Dear that was a fantastic attempt. So
1665560	1670440	Just trying to see it. So it seems to do a dive down and then a back sweep
1671960	1674440	Just trying to tame off accordingly
1675440	1682520	Yeah, he yeah, he can react instantly as soon as the tackle changes. He will swipe you and oh, sorry. Sorry didn't mean to do that
1684640	1686640	Okay, oh
1686680	1688680	That was for me
1690040	1694480	Rats, sorry, I thought he locked back on to the other replant. I do apologize
1695080	1698200	Some may find solo easier for the boss fight
1699440	1704040	Well, no one said that some may find solo easier actually because of more flash
1706200	1710360	Does everyone have I'm sure I think everyone's got the fast we'll give it a few good tries
1710360	1715360	If not, I'm actually fine to explore elsewhere. Like I went past all those scorpion places
1715480	1720920	And I wouldn't mind backtrack into all the scorpion places and because I feel like this
1722520	1731120	And this DLC Russian on my dick. Thank you. And this DLC is got so many areas to go like so many a doubt
1731120	1734640	We're actually stuck here so quickly and to explore in the DLC
1735160	1739240	And so we can do some adventuring and I'll just take you for walkies
1739240	1744240	Unironically solo can be a bit easier because the boss is more predictable predict all over
1744840	1747240	Predict all over your butt, but predicts of all
1747960	1749960	Okay, ready
1749960	1751960	Daddy
1751960	1759000	You guys have the lie down a mo always blessing us. Oh, we're getting play. Good man. Do you guys want you at my blessing?
1760960	1764000	There we go bless bless to impress
1764720	1768220	There we go bless bless to impress
1769600	1771600	Okay, let's get it
1772200	1776840	Get it. Let's get it. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Got bit. Got a bit. Hey, got a bit excited there
1778360	1783120	Okay, okay, I'm picking up my soul. Oh, wow. He never does that first
1783840	1789080	Holy shit. Give me that. Oh, I missed my souls. Wait, I can't see anything
1794200	1795360	Oh
1795360	1803520	Reflings get a little bit rolled off the bat, but that's understandable happening say wait, you know aggro change. See it's so hard. Oh
1804240	1807080	I rolled I should have rolled into right
1808240	1810240	Do a whack do a roll
1811320	1815040	Wow that aggro is so unforgiving. I
1815840	1817920	Can't even be mad though. It's so good
1818920	1824080	Wait, what's that glass? I don't even know what my wondrous physics the deep flask is
1824240	1827240	I'm just shoving it on though. We all just have a good time out here
1828080	1831560	Okay, that was actually really lucky with it. I would even get that spanking
1833720	1840320	I'm wondering. Oh, that was a big tally whack. Honestly, that was a lot of damage there
1841320	1843680	It came to cornering him, but he doesn't like it
1848440	1851280	Did I get electrocuted if I spank a car a
1852640	1857960	We bet wait you can't hit on money electrocuted or am I going crazy making that up?
1864000	1867120	What are you doing tonight? No, I can't help
1868280	1871080	No sugar that was the rolling some twice
1871600	1873600	Oh
1873960	1875960	No, we were actually doing so good
1876720	1878720	I'm so sorry
1878760	1884200	We were actually doing so good. It's that it's that second bait. He does against me
1884200	1889280	I need to roll into him, but my instincts are like roll away roll away enemy enemy. Oh
1890000	1892000	He got me in two hits
1893600	1897720	Oh my god, I've killed all the refunds with two left there. Okay, and come Clarissa
1901080	1903080	a

1919920	1923320	Why am I born like this it's a fucking MPC
1924040	1927520	The MPC is a reflin to know she started hitting
1928080	1934320	The invader reflin. Oh, she looks straight up follows you around. Wait, how far does she do you follow me down here? Oh

1952280	1954280	Go kill scorpions I
1955200	1961040	Didn't know that in-game MPCs would do that. How do we join scrawny BPC be

1966880	1971960	Yeah, she go go kill that MPC go kill that

1982400	1984400	Don't know how I dodged all of that
1987120	1991520	Sorry, I'm probably making this week for the boss attempt. I'm just so curious
1993840	1998920	So she does that's curious. I didn't know in-game MPCs would walk around. Yeah, that is
2000000	2001840	Fascinating sorry
2001840	2004000	The password is reflux. Yes
2004240	2011360	So in multiplayer if you do your password and then you'll use what's called a tarnished furled finger at the
2011400	2015240	Same location I'm at and then you'll be able. I'll be able to summon you in and
2015600	2022560	I can only summon two good reflins at a time in one bad one, but I can't summon bad ones right now. Are you ready?
2024000	2028000	No pressure since only ones are refling and the others an MPC
2029800	2031800	No pressure at all
2031800	2033800	I
2039840	2041840	Fucking
2047080	2049080	Oh, she's doing magic

2061800	2063800	Oh
2068280	2073880	You've done something to me, I don't know what I'm magic. Why is this a thing? The thing just changes
2074880	2080280	It just changes. I wasn't doing it right. I didn't count. I didn't count no one no one should be embarrassed
2080280	2084680	I didn't count I didn't count because there was one end of you. Well, this is starting well
2084680	2086920	Well, we're gonna give it a few times if it doesn't work
2086920	2088920	We're gonna go exploring cuz I like exploring
2089080	2092800	Cuz we've got so much of the map to go as well like tons of the map
2095560	2097560	Okay, here we go
2100480	2102480	Will you not had a shot
2106040	2108480	Is that wolf the fridge or my just hungry
2109760	2111760	So

2130280	2134120	There's so if you didn't know there's no like voice chat in the game or anything like that
2134120	2136120	But there are coconuts in the game
2136920	2141960	Which is hilarious because there's one coconut that's crying, but it sounds like whimpering
2142640	2144640	So the reflins come in and they go
2148000	2150240	Okay, the ritual has been
2151360	2153680	The reflings are safe yet again
2155000	2157800	Hello. Yes, you look he held a coconut and the coconut goes
2159160	2163440	That kind of locking onto the boss might be detrimental to the crazy movement
2163440	2169320	That's what I think like whenever I go against the wee dragon or whatever it keeps locking onto its chest
2172040	2175960	Can you stop going for me one this is feeling very targeted
2179040	2181040	We didn't even get an attempt
2194440	2198920	It's because I'm going for the souls I think I'm gonna have to hold back. I can't believe it. Oh
2216440	2218280	That was
2218280	2224080	Okay, I'm starting to understand why people are like, bro, what the heck no one can even play this unless you and

2514600	2516760	The repeating fires a weapon are
2518360	2519880	Okay

2585480	2588200	Any melee player? Oh wait, wrong one

2601880	2603880	refling
2604160	2607960	Not sure I'll try and pick up my souls because I quite a lot
2610960	2613760	Finally home from a week of camping without signals
2613760	2618080	So got a week of screams to catch up on still 25 minutes behind
2618080	2624480	But how to train your dragon is a good trilogy candidate for a watch a lot. Oh it is but it makes me cry
2626080	2630480	I remember like ball in my eyes at my grand's house watching that
2631480	2633480	I
2638040	2642640	Really not understand in the inventory system. I have tons of arrows selected
2646320	2648720	Whatever bear with me bear with me
2650160	2653200	Thank you so much for the tip a milk cadmium
2653920	2659600	I'll be able to fight hit that and actually respond in just a moment. You see I'm doing what's called
2661480	2663480	You look away for a second
2665400	2671120	Hold on don't zap me. I'm swapping. Um, I don't get it. I really get all collected
2674520	2677640	Why are you doing that now I just put what I
2678480	2680480	Just put that on
2681280	2686800	It's a great ball. It has to be a ball ball. I'm so confused
2687800	2694160	Why doesn't it not all put like our own chamber? I mean, I guess I know our

3292820	3299500	I don't think any briefly I don't think anyone plays with a crossbow. So no one actually has like crossbowls to go

3349980	3353260	Through my brother
3357100	3361040	Look at that 36 damage, you love to see it ladies and gentlemen
3361740	3367420	36 that okay, I will say as humorous is that is to land like 40 damage
3367420	3371860	I am actually it adds up. Okay. It's like a numbers game
3372460	3376060	Number goes higher the more time I hit this crossbow. I
3376620	3378620	Can not believe that. Oh
3379940	3381940	My god, I
3382340	3384340	Mean he is reacting
3385060	3388820	And I I think I do take our group wait a few times to chill
3390540	3394500	Like even that small agro there, yeah, and then I'll go agro again
3396020	3398020	One two
3402100	3404100	Wow
3410620	3413140	Oh, it does three rotations geez
3415340	3417340	Wow
3420500	3422500	Oh
3423580	3428800	I'm keen to get in the attack pattern just a little bit like when he does a big sweep
3428820	3432340	He does a delete second one, which is what always gets me
3434140	3437260	Oh, he said I see your lava. I'm taking off the board
3437260	3439260	I
3440220	3445180	Got agro again one swipe pause, maybe no
3447260	3454780	Didn't quite understand that I guess he's in a different face, so he'll react differently and do different
3455900	3459020	So it's a bit okay back to me
3459580	3466460	Which is fine happy with that. Oh, he's asleep. Sorry. I think I just fucked up your special attack on him there
3467260	3469260	It was an honest mistake
3474140	3476860	I'm doing it. I'm he's not giving me agro
3478060	3482620	Yeah, the reflins are just bouncing between the agro between them both
3483900	3486620	I mean, maybe it's kind of good that it's done like that
3488940	3490940	I'll maybe try and lure him away
3491180	3493900	Right keeps moving so much. I'm missing all my shots
3494860	3495900	Oh
3495900	3502220	Some heavy damage one reflin is down. No, we've so got this. Sorry, but we're actually getting so close
3502460	3504780	We are a hundred percent getting so close
3505100	3511660	I'm gonna see if I can take that agro a bit. Let him jump into me. I'm afraid I'm not familiar with this wind phase that much
3512140	3514140	I don't really know what he does
3514620	3516540	He does that
3516540	3521260	Learning learning not good. Not good. Okay. He blocks his lightning phase
3521820	3529420	So he has he has different elemental phases. No, he doesn't because he just used winter and ice and oh, shit
3531100	3532940	Oh, well
3532940	3539420	There is we did fantastic. I'm not even mad. I'm not even mad. I don't have enough time to swap to my other weapon
3541180	3543180	I don't have time
3543660	3550300	Okay, that's not bad a hundred percent. We have this fate. I'm not leaving. We have this fate. I'm satisfied that we
3550860	3558540	Definitely have oh wait, dad. Can I not do spirit ashes? Oh, no, I can't do spirit ashes because I have it as a crossbow upgraded
3558700	3560700	I think it's probably level one
3561340	3562780	um
3562780	3566620	We a hundred percent can do this. I have faith. I'm sorry. I have faith. I believe
3567500	3569500	I believe in a thing called love
3571340	3573340	Yeah
3574140	3576140	A hundred percent have oh
3576540	3578540	Why did they do that?
3579100	3581100	They know full well what they're doing when they do that
3584060	3586060	You can put your sword in another hand
3590140	3592140	Like that
3593660	3595660	And how do I get it out?
3597420	3605420	Oh, sorry. Sorry. I'm just practicing. Oh, we've got blood bone bolts. Let's check them out
3605580	3607580	Uh
3607900	3609260	Causes
3609260	3613980	Blood blood loss build up so it has less damage, but it goes for
3614860	3617500	Like critical build up. That's curious
3618540	3620540	Perfumers bolts
3620620	3625500	Uh flame balls black key balls. Okay. The reef one. So you want it right?
3626940	3628940	That's your ritual
3631420	3633420	Uh a hundred percent think we'll go there
3636380	3639900	A whole 45 that seven damage
3641100	3644700	All right, let me quickly get my thingies my thingy my bobbers
3646380	3648940	I yeah, I'm making a hundred percent of this fight. I have faith
3652220	3657260	I don't know when you learn the enemy too too silly damage
3658380	3664060	That was one that was two. Yeah, I did it too early. I know I'm getting it now though. I did it too early
3664220	3666220	I get it
3667260	3673180	I don't know if I'm going to get like a notification that he just gets to bleed out damage. I don't think so
3673740	3675740	I've taken the aggro. They can get a few hits in
3678460	3680940	I know I'm not taking the aggro
3683820	3685820	Holy holy
3688300	3692620	I'm helping I'm helping okay, we're in lightning phase. That's good
3693420	3696860	When we get into the wind phase, that's when we know we're the
3698140	3705100	I think it's lightning then wind and then ice elemental phases and then that's when we know we're in the money or not
3712220	3718060	We're getting there we're getting there 50 percent 50 percent delayed jump. No
3718140	3720140	Oh
3721180	3724940	We got a critical we did get a critical
3728780	3737340	But only okay, we've got we've got ice we've got ice. I repeat there is ice on the board
3738220	3740220	One refling does go down
3741020	3743180	However, he's he's getting so low
3743420	3745420	Oh

4004940	4010140	Oh my god, two hands the sword women. No two hands the sword. Oh for fuck's sake
4012540	4014540	We tried the freaking
4014780	4015900	Oh
4015900	4022300	Wait, why am I not getting any hit registration does he have invincible invisible frames when he perishes someone?
4023180	4025180	Yeah, sorry. I'm not making this out alive
4025900	4027900	Hold y lb. That was miserable
4029340	4031340	Damn this line got hands literally
4032860	4034860	That rifling got eaten in a bite
4036540	4040060	Since when does he do hand grabs it must be his ultimate if you're low enough
4040220	4046220	All right, I'll maybe we'll do crossbow
4047420	4053820	I want to do that. Right. So that's fire to put them on fire and then that ludge
4056620	4058620	How's his blood loss build up we'll do that
4060060	4065980	And then poison build up. Yeah, that does take damage. That's how the game works, right surely
4066940	4069420	I mean I didn't I didn't twice taterally
4071660	4073660	You're actually being in
4076060	4078060	I'm just gonna check there's no one
4081340	4087740	A mage rifling, okay, let's see if mage melee and crossbow might work. I'm not sure
4089420	4093020	Just by the way, if it's not obvious, this is literally just two guys in a costume. Look
4093900	4096940	If they want to do it in their free time, that's fine as long as they just don't
4098620	4100620	I'm trying to make one of those jokes. We're just like
4102860	4105660	Terrible joke no one's laughing
4107740	4109740	Right, let's see
4109740	4112300	Are we ready a little a little pre-work is
4114060	4115580	And a little
4115580	4117580	Okay pre-work is let's go
4118060	4119580	I know we can do this
4119580	4123180	Sorry, but I'm not budging from this spot until we do it because I know we can do it
4124860	4126860	Okay, I'm gonna let him go for me
4129660	4133180	Not like this not my half a million souls not like this
4136940	4138940	Okay, now we can help
4141260	4144540	I've got poison on over bleed sugar I put them the wrong way
4145260	4147260	Wait, why would you take that first?
4147980	4153340	It's strange. Okay, there we go. Oh, I miss. I'm too far away
4158380	4160380	Uh, I'm helping question mark
4163580	4167420	He doesn't even know who to aggro well me clearly
4174460	4176460	Me clearly
4177660	4180700	He can move like so far
4182860	4184860	Blood and poison works in his case
4187660	4191900	I I can't react to anything. I'm so sorry. I'm like half asleep right now
4193180	4197260	I'm absolutely nothing going for me. I'm spanking himself with these crossbow bolts
4200060	4202060	Oh, no
4202700	4204700	Nah, this can't be
4205660	4209900	Oh, no, we're both we're both long range. I don't want him to take the aggro
4213020	4219580	Yeah, what are you doing? Oh the lightning. I can even react to the lightning if I wanted to
4223660	4229420	Ah sugar, uh, why left bumper? Yeah, I did it. Why left bumper?
4229580	4237740	Wow, okay, only to get absolutely decimated with poor reaction time. It's fine. It's fine. I'm not gonna win against fucking half
4239660	4242460	Wait, how did I dodge that? I didn't even roll or anything
4243340	4246700	We replays are also two people in a costume to make up the height
4247500	4251020	bleeding does 15% of the max hp. He's not used to
4251980	4253980	mage replays. That's why he's so confused
4254940	4259980	My story I'm late. How's the game so far? So we're back at this boss in the dlc
4260140	4267180	I know for a fact reeflings can do it because I you missed it. I got one hp in a dreamed
4267740	4269740	and
4269740	4273420	You've been in I'm just checking. Oh, you've not had a shot yet today
4274700	4276460	um
4276460	4278460	I'm just
4278460	4282140	We we can do it. So I refuse to walk away basically
4282780	4285820	I genuinely refuse to walk away because I know we can do it
4287660	4289660	You're ready to start so yeah
4291820	4295740	Weapon art is max hp tick damage
4296940	4300060	Leave some face to use the black knight
4302460	4306860	Put me in coach I just woke up and I got caffeine in me a yellow caffeinated
4307180	4311100	I might have to make another cup of tea like so fucking early into the stream. I'm sorry
4311420	4315580	I'll actually only played like what for 20 minutes and I'm like I need another cup of tea and dine
4316300	4318540	Okay, uh the pre how do I?
4319980	4321980	Oh, okay, we're doing the pre-war
4322780	4324780	As always I don't mind
4325500	4331100	Okay, we have been doing kisses just to speed things along a bit because I may or may not have been dying all the damn time
4331660	4333660	Right you're lying down
4334380	4340940	Okay, wait, let me do a run and start for this one. This is the run. This is the run. I bless. Oh, wait. Hold wait. What?
4342540	4345660	Oh freaking sake. Sorry. Sorry. Hold on. Hold on. I've got a bit over the else
4346060	4349500	This is the run. This is the blessing. Mine push gives you
4353260	4356780	Man shall feel no tighter clam in you humanity
4357340	4358460	right
4358460	4360460	I'll do it take damage
4360460	4363500	Is there even a point in putting my wee sword on? I don't know
4365900	4369820	I feel like I feel like I just messed things up if I put a second thing
4370860	4374220	I'm sleep deprived but I can still fight honestly when you said that
4377820	4381660	Not to brag or anything but I did 15 damage there smile
4386060	4388060	Why does it not lock to the bottom?
4391100	4394140	Well, someone poisoned them. I saw that that wasn't me that poisoned them
4404780	4406780	Oh, whoa
4411180	4413980	That rifling getting chomps, I didn't know you were in a war
4413980	4415980	I
4420300	4422300	Get cheeky bleeds
4422380	4428780	Whoa, I think that was the bleed there. Did you see that? I think that was me. I'm helping. I'm helping. I'm actually helping
4430700	4434300	I'm sorry. I was I was a pain attention. Sorry. Hold on
4435820	4437820	I think I actually did the bleed
4439420	4441420	Only took me how long
4442220	4450300	Oh, he's got his aggroed on me. Don't get distracted. Oh, nice walk. That's the problem. He keeps swapping angry
4456700	4460460	Come on right we're in phase two officially
4463020	4465020	Oh, we've got a lightning spray
4465420	4471180	Okay, aggroed that's fine unaggroed that's fine
4472780	4476060	That's not only complain. It's so freaking hard to tell
4477020	4479020	Like it feels so quick
4479340	4481340	of him coming into you
4481980	4486780	Oh, okay now. I can't dodge all these attacks. How are you supposed to?
4492380	4494380	Oh, thank god
4495020	4501180	How are you supposed to do this solo? That was like what six barrage of an attack in one go
4504460	4508620	Oh, I was too late. I can see it coming but I think because of his phase one
4508620	4513660	I think in his phase two he's actually faster when he does that attack and it messes me up
4518300	4520300	Oh
4521260	4523260	What's that move? What is it?
4523980	4525980	It's like an ace song
4530700	4536140	Oh, is this it? I don't want to jinx it, but we're all pretty high health
4537980	4540940	I'm doing cheeky tick damage with my weak crossbow
4545340	4550380	Unless I twat it up manually twat it up anyone any manually twatters
4553820	4555820	Oh my god, we're doing it
4556460	4557980	Oh my god
4557980	4564380	Oh my god, I need I need to aggro off him right go right now. No, that's what didn't want. I needed to take aggro
4569820	4574220	I'm trying to like not cross over. Okay. I have aggro. That's good
4575900	4578220	No, I don't I've lost it. I've lost it
4579180	4586060	Oh shit, this sounds like a world of warcraft grade dps. Can you slow down you take an aggro off of me?
4587740	4589740	Okay, okay
4591980	4594220	Oh that ace stomp is so big
4596300	4601900	That ace stomp is so big. Okay. Okay. That's fine. I can handle it. I can handle it. I can handle it
4608220	4610220	Ah
4610380	4613100	You so hard that oh, maybe not
4617660	4623740	I know we can do it. I know we can do it. I'm sorry. I'm not leaving. I know you replants can do it
4623740	4627580	I'm so proud of you like you guys are putting in so much effort
4628380	4631020	You guys so have this like you really do
4631020	4633020	I
4635580	4639020	Apparently I already have a tally. Do you mean harm you don't have a tally?
4639900	4645020	I know you replants can do it. I really do. I believe in you wholeheartedly. You're doing fantastic
4645020	4650860	I know it's frustrating getting in the game and I know there's like and I know you've been debuffed and everything
4650860	4652860	But use use of got it. I'm so
4653660	4656860	I'm I know use of got it either so strong
4657820	4663340	I might need to do it this way if you want the blessing blessing. Oh again. All right. Oh shit. We're going for it
4663340	4666380	We're going for it. I think are we going for it? Okay. I think we're going for it

4681660	4683660	You
4686620	4688940	Okay, we're just gonna go for bleeds
4693340	4697660	I wasn't paying attention not gonna lie. Ma. Oh, yeah, okay
4698780	4700380	It's okay
4700380	4702060	Let him get up
4702060	4706780	And maybe when he goes up, I maybe actually oh, I think I just applied fleek damage
4706780	4712140	Or maybe one of the reasons that actually those melee weapons do look a bit bleed effect ish
4713100	4715100	So
4717740	4723420	Really the challenges we just need 10 bleed effect hits. That's it right because if it does
4724220	4726220	10% of the full health of the enemy
4728540	4730540	Oh shit, I'm not in position
4731420	4735740	Okay, okay, go a little cheeky special
4736540	4738540	So stagger
4740220	4742780	Strongly be a good girl and cover your ears
4743500	4749020	I want to thank all of my fellow reeflings for being such good fellow reeflings. I'm still love
4749580	4752620	Why would I need to cover my ears for that? They're so awesome
4752620	4754620	Um

4771180	4773500	Oh, I was freaking spam and be
4775340	4777100	No
4777100	4779100	That was the fucking run
4779500	4781500	No, wait, I'm alive
4787820	4790380	Oh, no, this can't be I was alive
4791580	4795420	This whole time I was alive. I thought he died. I just gave up
4797820	4800460	I don't know if that other reefling gave up for the fairest
4803740	4805740	Oh my god
4806700	4810860	Relentless that was literally one HP
4814140	4818540	That was one HP in a freaking ring. Why why do I have a notification on youtube?
4819660	4821660	Congrats
4822620	4823980	Oh
4823980	4830140	YouTube says new copyright match copyright match found. Yeah, I'm just lost the game TV

4859820	4865980	That's that's called a highlight of it. Hey, jeez. Anyway, anyway
4867900	4872060	This crossbow will create the heavens at bear
4873100	4874620	right
4874620	4876620	Russian you've been in twice. I think
4878300	4880300	shame
4881660	4886460	Oh my god, I'm gonna sing my ears because I'm having to wear a headset all day well
4887020	4892540	Having to wear is a bit of a dramatic chair. Your name is chair
4894940	4896940	Chair chair has come into the pre
4899260	4901260	YouTube when their own system
4901660	4907100	Literally, I don't mind clipping at all. I remember people like we're like, what's the rules about clipping the girls?
4907100	4911500	I'm like, uh, do you realize how much it supports the girls if you like
4912220	4916460	You know, if you have the free time and you find yourself like you've not
4916940	4919440	I've got anything to do but you watch the girls
4920140	4926140	Seriously become a clip channel. Not only can you monetize those clips and make money for like all the time you put into it
4926300	4931660	You can hone a craft which is editing skills, which is always needed. I cannot tell you how much editing skills are needed
4932060	4934060	Okay, we're doing the ritual
4934780	4935900	um
4935900	4939100	Like don't be afraid to click we're not like I don't know if there's other
4939500	4943180	Vita agencies are like, we're gonna copyright you. No, we don't do that
4943340	4950060	Like as long as you're not derogatory or anything like well, I mean the guess is just ignore anyway if it's derogatory
4952220	4956780	She will never play my name is chair. Uh, wait this other refling time out
4959340	4961660	Other refling I think your connection might be do-do
4961660	4963660	Okay
4965180	4970060	Don't worry fellow reflings every tribe will tire the boss out. He'll die eventually
4970460	4973980	We know why his name is chair. What because of this reason?
4976300	4978300	I think those are refling might have timed out
4978860	4980860	There you are stand right there
4982540	4984540	Okay
4984860	4988220	You get done as soon as you come in right let me get my weak crossbow
4992620	4994540	Okay, we're ready
4994540	5001580	Are we steady? Do we have any blessings or anything? No, just oh shit. I think I think maybe that was a slight blessing back there, but it's okay
5003180	5006220	Oh, yeah, that's right. Take that seven damage, baby
5008700	5011260	One and then one two three
5011980	5016780	Yeah, so on phase one his oh god, I don't like that. I don't like that. I'll do that again
5018780	5020780	Don't do that again
5022380	5024380	I'll get lit. Oh, baby
5024460	5026460	All right, let me take arrow
5027020	5029020	Wait, I'm empty
5029260	5031260	Why am I empty?
5031340	5033340	See this game actually so confusing
5033740	5040060	I've selected both arrows. Sorry. If I select both arrows, it should just indiscriminately use some once one
5042700	5044700	Let's see if I can get poisoned down. I don't know
5048460	5050460	Hold on hold on
5052540	5054540	Oh
5054940	5058780	Okay, hold on. I might just fuck up really badly there. Hold on
5066700	5068700	Recovered that one
5068700	5070700	Okay
5072860	5075820	You want to see the concept art of how these came up with this one
5077820	5079820	Honestly
5081660	5083660	You're supposed to take down me
5090460	5094620	I'm not gonna lie. I was baiting my lips there but not on the good bait in the lip as in the
5094940	5100220	Munkai is baiting the lips. I don't even know what this wonder is fully done. I don't remember what I put in it
5101820	5106780	How you randomly? Well, I mean at least that roof needs to peel, but you randomly changed target
5106940	5108940	I can't give up
5109900	5114700	I do like that attack though, like they're getting up and doing a spray around the circle
5118780	5120780	Oh, I need to heal. What am I playing at?
5121660	5123260	Oh, no
5123260	5125660	Every fling is down. I repeat every fling is down
5126940	5128940	We are on winter fiend
5139740	5145580	So when he stomps it's a three chicken leg leg, uh pattern
5147420	5149420	No
5150220	5156060	I'm not gonna waste any more ammo. I'll just melee him today. Come here. Wait, that's not really
5159820	5161820	Why does chair sound like a cat?
5162780	5164780	Huh
5165180	5167180	Oh my squeaky chair
5167420	5169420	Or did I misunderstand
5170060	5173180	Right bumper and right trigger fire with left or right bolt
5175820	5177820	Why
5177980	5179980	Why would they have it set up?
5181820	5183820	I mean
5185420	5187420	I get it
5187740	5189740	But why
5191100	5193100	They mean chair's character
5193420	5195420	Uh
5195740	5202460	Pineapple you've known how to show make sure to eat your pineapple. No, actually you guys eat tomato

5355420	5360860	Okay, that was really fucking sin. It's not even in the lobby. Did she get stuck?

5431100	5434780	Surely and if sin sold this boss just as a warning though
5434940	5441420	There's severe lag and you are severely debuffed. Okay, I don't know why you weren't allowed in though right now
5442220	5444220	and
5444220	5446220	And then traverse limits

5468460	5472540	Okay, let's try it again, and you come sentin'.
5472540	5473540	How?
5473540	5478540	He's so mean, he needs to stop lockin' onto me.
5478540	5482140	Right, no, we need to see the capabilities of Sin.
5482140	5485100	I know she's gonna go absolutely berserk.
5485100	5489020	We need to wait for Sin to show up, because seriously, I know she's gonna fuckin' rip
5489020	5492020	up on my new one.
5492020	5496020	Wow, wow, wow.
5496020	5500020	El Bereth, you've not had a shot.
5500020	5507020	Who, Ty, Lord, I do apologize, you just got millisecond and then I completely balls up.
5507020	5509020	Where is she?
5509020	5511020	Where is she?
5511020	5514020	I can smell her.
5514020	5515020	Oh.
5515020	5518020	Oh, it's you for music.
5518020	5523020	Okay, we have our champion, don't blow steam up Mars like this.
5523020	5526020	If you soloed this boss, you're actually insane.
5526020	5529020	Did you start on a new account or anything?
5529020	5534020	She's gone gollum.
5534020	5536020	Honestly.
5536020	5537020	Honestly.
5537020	5540020	Right, okay, we're ready to see.
5540020	5545020	I am gonna, well, it doesn't matter now, I don't need the souls, so I don't really need to do anything.
5545020	5549020	I'm gonna let him target someone.
5549020	5554020	Uh, uh, one.
5554020	5557020	Oh, I was far too early on that one, I'm not gonna lie.
5557020	5559020	Okay, Sin is in the battle dome.
5559020	5562020	I repeat, Sin is in the battle dome.
5562020	5563020	Oh, I've taken aggro.
5563020	5565020	That's okay though.
5565020	5567020	I'm allowed to take aggro.
5567020	5570020	And he doesn't fuck with me.
5570020	5575020	The other reefling is stuck outside the battle dome, unfortunately.
5575020	5577020	Oh no.
5577020	5579020	Oh no, I need to heal.
5579020	5581020	I need to heal, I'm already throwing.
5581020	5586020	Okay, the second reefling did make it inside the battle dome, all is good, all is wise.
5586020	5589020	We have a lot of aggro going on.
5589020	5591020	Okay, we have magic reefling.
5591020	5595020	There's gonna be a lot of aggro switching, she says, as the aggro has been swapped.
5595020	5599020	The guards are to be wrong, the aggro has been swapped.
5599020	5606020	There is gonna be a lot of aggro switching.
5606020	5609020	Wow.
5609020	5610020	Do I need taunt?
5610020	5617020	I'm like, do I need to put on that taunt trinket and just run around like a crazy person?
5617020	5620020	Because only crazy people can run.
5620020	5623020	You know that's how it works.
5623020	5626020	Okay, Sin does heal up.
5626020	5629020	We're about to hit phase two lightning.
5629020	5633020	Need to be careful, need to be careful.
5633020	5636020	Okay, I hate when he's up because he doesn't do it.
5636020	5642020	Okay, her person is taking all of the fucking aggro.
5642020	5646020	He's not even looking at me, I'm gonna regret saying that.
5646020	5655020	I literally hook, lane, and sinkered myself to do that.
5655020	5665020	Okay, again, it's so hard to see who he's charging the attack up for.
5665020	5670020	Okay, let's see if I can take aggro off them, I don't want to get hurt too much.
5670020	5677020	We are below 50% health.
5677020	5684020	I am going for the Scarlet Mortuce!
5684020	5689020	That was a fucking Christmas miracle, I dodged those other two attacks.
5689020	5694020	Oh, I got caught up in that one but it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
5694020	5697020	I still have some...
5697020	5703020	I think maybe I need to poison, I don't know.
5704020	5713020	They're flippin' about so much, it's like making my crossbows like undoable.
5713020	5715020	Okay, I need to be careful here.
5715020	5719020	I said I need to be careful here!
5719020	5724020	Okay, okay, okay, take your time.
5724020	5730020	Let's go for poison damage now on our crossbows.
5730020	5740020	I have aggro, that's okay, that's okay, that is okay.
5740020	5749020	I'm poppin' my physics, don't know what it does, but I'm poppin' it anyway.
5749020	5753020	How do you even come up with boss music, dude?
5753020	5757020	Not good, I'm down to one health to seek.
5758020	5764020	God, I think we're all weak, I think we're out of heals.
5764020	5771020	This team is tired, this is the best I got.
5771020	5775020	Oh, wow, how did I even dodge that? That was by accident.
5775020	5781020	I'm not even gonna pretend otherwise, I dodged that by accident.
5781020	5789020	Oh, no, not like this, not like this.
5789020	5792020	Didn't that cheeky poison damage?
5792020	5798020	I'm out, and for that reason, I'm out.
5798020	5801020	Not the light, man.
5801020	5807020	Holy shit, me and fuckin' Senna in sync, we're doing the exact same thing as each other.
5807020	5810020	Holy fuck.
5810020	5814020	Me, like, it literally means Senna's fucking synced up there, did you see that?
5814020	5816020	The way we were moving around the battlefield?
5816020	5819020	You didn't even know what I was doing from behind.
5819020	5825020	Holy crap, if you still had Bleedbolt, I think I'm out.
5825020	5832020	Got Flame, I got Poison, I got Ritusei, I got Lightning and Fire.
5832020	5836020	I don't know what he's resistant to.
5836020	5839020	Sorry, resistant to.
5839020	5841020	Okay, let me see, sure.
5841020	5843020	Is Senna wanting to go again? I think so.
5843020	5845020	Could you imagine if we do it a bit?
5845020	5850020	None other than the hit streamers, Senna.
5850020	5860020	Uh, you even know how to show, actually, Tyler, do you need Senna to do a show?
5860020	5864020	I love it when Senna knows she dies, it still goes in.
5864020	5869020	Literally, she's the bravest of us all.
5869020	5876020	She's probably ready to whack me being like, what are you doing, not helping in the fight?
5876020	5878020	Yeah, we're done.
5878020	5887020	After this, you should have a refling take cue to sign Ciclida's fragments to basically help you get scaled up with the bosses.
5887020	5892020	Oh no, is Sen region? Does she need a moment? Avenge me.
5892020	5894020	Oh no, is Senna, is that all the time you had?
5894020	5896020	Rip, rip, rip, rip. Okay, okay, okay, okay.
5896020	5899020	Thank you for hanging reflings.
5899020	5902020	Thank you for hanging Senna, that was absolutely fucking amazing.
5902020	5909020	I was like, wait, there's like a high likelihood that actually is her, because you're so fucking good at Elden Ring, honestly.
5909020	5913020	Okay, we're giving you a six, you can't rip.
5913020	5915020	Is Senna certified refling?
5915020	5918020	Well, I'm a certified imp.
5918020	5920020	So, yeah.
5920020	5923020	I'd say we're pretty on par for one another.
5923020	5926020	She almost carried, no, she did carry, joking me.
5926020	5928020	Right, mwah, mwah.
5928020	5931020	We've got a spell, oh, another one.
5931020	5933020	Another one, and we go.
5933020	5935020	And we go, I say we go.
5935020	5939020	I'm sorry, mummy, I was late to the last one.
5939020	5941020	Don't worry.
5942020	5948020	The good news is, well, someone took Agil instantly.
5948020	5958020	Let's build up the rotisserie, and then we'll do build up the poison.
5958020	5966020	Big wall lips, big wall lips all around, not gonna lie.
5966020	5968020	Mwah!
5968020	5971020	Someone got a bleed off.
5971020	5973020	Right, we're gonna swap to the other one now.
5973020	5979020	We're gonna swap to poison, see if that even does anything.
5979020	5985020	Doesn't feel like poison's really doing too much.
5985020	5987020	That's okay.
5990020	5992020	We're getting twerked on.
5992020	5994020	Literally, that refling literally just got twerked on.
5994020	5996020	I'm sure you all saw that.
5996020	5998020	In real time, in real time.
6002020	6005020	Well, someone got ultimate, Eldritch.
6005020	6008020	Can he not take damage when he's in that state?
6008020	6011020	Oh no, he can't be.
6014020	6017020	Strongly imps in refling, honestly.
6022020	6026020	I'm, like, smiling and, like, biting my lips.
6026020	6028020	Because it's, like, just so good.
6028020	6030020	Like, I'm not even mad.
6030020	6035020	I'm, like, it's just, like, in awe of this boss thing.
6042020	6045020	Did you stagger him there?
6046020	6051020	Okay, I don't, I don't know if he's even afflicted.
6051020	6053020	Mwah!
6053020	6056020	I'm not even sure he's afflicted with rotisserie.
6058020	6065020	I'm trying to make sure there's not so much aggro on the other refling at any one point!
6075020	6081020	Uh, sorry, I feel like literally focused to see what cues the game was giving me to let me...
6084020	6086020	To let me get away with it.
6089020	6092020	Oh no, no, no, not like this!
6092020	6094020	Not like this, refling!
6097020	6102020	Uh, I don't even have an excuse why I didn't respond in time to that one.
6105020	6107020	Hey!
6110020	6112020	Hey!
6119020	6121020	Oh, the lightning got me!
6123020	6126020	Oh no! Right, okay, okay.
6127020	6131020	Oh, I can't even, I will actually want to let him kill me.
6131020	6135020	And I can't even get close to him, from the Nile he is.
6135020	6137020	Wow, we can do it, we can do it.
6137020	6140020	I'm sorry, I don't care if the stream turns into 12 hours of this.
6140020	6143020	I know for a fact we can do it.
6144020	6148020	She's suffering, but she likes it. Damn, guess I'm still too easy from waking up.
6148020	6150020	Bro got eight.
6150020	6153020	You're allowed to be eaten with it, boss.
6154020	6162020	It's been a couple of hours now, and little coachwoman still hasn't yet defeated Big Matt.
6162020	6168020	Well, if you want to come defeat him for us, you're more than welcome to.
6173020	6176020	Just to tell you, you did get a second chance.
6176020	6179020	Um, I'm very sorry, I cannot recall.
6180020	6182020	F, no, that's MPP.
6183020	6191020	I can't recall if you had a good attempt or not, and you're one.
6191020	6194020	You were recent, you're like very recent.
6195020	6199020	Rushing on the 6th, you've had a few 10s.
6199020	6203020	Major refund, I think you only had one attempt, you did, you've not had a second.
6204020	6206020	I'm trying to make it as fair as possible.
6206020	6208020	You know the rules, you know-
6237020	6241020	They're never gonna leave me.
6241020	6243020	That's the sentence.
6243020	6247020	Lightning, let's get fire and lightning, thunder bolts and lightning.
6247020	6249020	Very, very frightening.
6249020	6251020	Galileo, Galileo.
6251020	6253020	And bolts too.
6253020	6256020	Oh wait, we got bleed bolts, hold on, we got bleed bolts.
6257020	6261020	And we've all been dying.
6263020	6267020	Not gonna lie, I don't think this is the game that wants me to be summoned.
6267020	6269020	Are you on PC?
6269020	6274020	And are you using the code Reef in the multiplayer section?
6274020	6280020	Right, we'll do raw and we'll do fire, cause he doesn't use fire.
6280020	6286020	So by video game logic, but the multiplayer password up there is just Reef in capital letters.
6287020	6289020	And you should show up.
6291020	6294020	Oh, more bleed, tons more bleed.
6294020	6296020	Well, I guess we're bleeding this guy's to death.
6296020	6298020	Okay, pre-work is-
6301020	6303020	Okay, let's go.
6304020	6307020	I'm playing on PS5, oh it's not cross play.
6308020	6311020	Well, Reefland is not cross play.
6311020	6315020	You have been misled, you've been led astray by the lies.
6318020	6321020	Okay, let him get up, let him get up.
6321020	6324020	Big dive, big dive, big double dive.
6324020	6326020	Hit me with a triple dive.
6326020	6331020	Okay, triple on the dives, I repeat, triple on the dives.
6331020	6336020	Magic Reefling is swapping that aggro but does get picked on.
6336020	6338020	Are we all far away?
6338020	6340020	All of us are far away.
6340020	6344020	Oh no, this can't be, all of us attack from far away.
6345020	6348020	I mean, he's already down to lightning phase.
6348020	6351020	Did we not just enter this battle, Amina?
6353020	6356020	But I'm getting there.
6357020	6360020	I'm taking aggro, big jump.
6360020	6364020	Second attack, third attack with a butt swipe or something.
6364020	6368020	Posting off the butt swipe, lightning bolt, same thing.
6368020	6372020	Oh, he's got raw, I think I just saw raw effects on him.
6372020	6375020	I don't have bleed on him but...
6377020	6380020	Is that for me? No.
6381020	6384020	It's so hard to see who he's wanting to look onto.
6384020	6387020	Looks like it's on Mage Reefling.
6388020	6391020	Oh no, it's me, my turn.
6392020	6394020	My turn.
6394020	6397020	Good, good, good.
6399020	6403020	Not good, this one is not good because it's so fucking hard to dodge.
6404020	6406020	I think we're being rocked from the floor.
6406020	6409020	Again, one, and then...
6410020	6412020	A whirlwind swipe?
6413020	6416020	No, aggro changed.
6416020	6418020	Aggro changed.
6419020	6422020	Aggro changed to Mage.
6424020	6427020	No, I always fucked that one up.
6428020	6431020	Holy shit, you guys did it, you knocked him down.
6432020	6435020	All it took was three long range reeflings.
6438020	6440020	Holy shit.
6440020	6442020	I believe.
6442020	6447020	I believe, I believe, I have faith in the reeflings, I have faith in their hearts.
6448020	6450020	Deep down they know they can do it.
6450020	6456020	They have the strength, I believe, I believe, I believe.
6456020	6460020	Got reeflings, oh my god.
6460020	6466020	Remembrance of the dancing lion, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe.
6466020	6469020	Thank you reeflings, thank you.
6469020	6471020	Wow, what did the boss draw?
6471020	6473020	His head.
6473020	6475020	Up with his head.
6475020	6478020	Does this give me better stuff?
6482020	6485020	Wow, that looks very scary.
6488020	6491020	Yeah, that's what you get for making this take so long.
6491020	6494020	Oh, I don't like it, it's actually kind of scary though.
6498020	6502020	Bro, the major reefing put in unholy work, really?
6503020	6506020	I can hardly tell, because it's getting very well.
6506020	6509020	Can I, I can't ride horsey through here.
6509020	6511020	Oh, it's an elevator, okay.
6511020	6516020	Wait, hold on, let me get my sword out, you know, like the actual thing that I swing about.
6516020	6517020	Where is it?
6517020	6518020	Where is it?
6518020	6519020	Here I am.
6519020	6521020	And then hold.
6526020	6527020	Let's explore.
6527020	6532020	Because I can't have this spell he uses OP.
6532020	6534020	What, the moon beam?
6534020	6536020	What a good boss fight.
6536020	6538020	Ooh, that's fire.
6538020	6540020	Ma, thank you for the gifted membership.
6540020	6543020	Congrats to those who caught it in your face.
6543020	6545020	Thanks again, Ma.
6545020	6551020	Wait, if that was celebration for the boss fight, why I didn't do any other work?
6551020	6554020	I didn't do a single bit of the work.
6557020	6558020	Ooh.
6564020	6565020	Okay.
6565020	6567020	Oh, there's a remembrance here.
6567020	6569020	I need to go back and get that one.
6569020	6571020	Reverence spirit, I shall live.
6571020	6574020	Is this bowling ball alley?
6574020	6579020	Or is the game actually going to give us a section with no enemies?
6579020	6582020	Or am I giving the game too much faith for you to let me do that?
6582020	6585020	That's madness that's coming out of the urge tree.
6585020	6588020	It looks like it anyway.
6588020	6591020	A house of thorns, I guess?
6591020	6593020	Overgrown roots.
6593020	6594020	Hello?
6594020	6597020	Are you okay?
6597020	6600020	Oh, tower of ours, hidden in shadow.
6600020	6603020	Oh, lofty spiral piercing the heavens.
6603020	6608020	Lead him safely unto greater godhood.
6608020	6611020	And in divinity, grant our salvation.
6611020	6613020	Curious.
6613020	6615020	Curious.
6615020	6617020	You actually did take a bit of aggro off the last fight.
6617020	6619020	Did I actually?
6619020	6622020	I just fucking...
6622020	6625020	I'm just firing my laser.
6625020	6627020	And by laser, I...
6632020	6635020	Why is there so much blood here?
6635020	6637020	Tower of shadow message.
6637020	6639020	We'll just read it.
6639020	6650020	The gate of divinity lies in the tower sealed by shadow.
6650020	6655020	That is truly where Khaind Mekela is headed.
6655020	6658020	We are no MP...
6658020	6663020	MP Reans, but we must locate the path that we deserve.
6663020	6666020	And follow the process...
6673020	6675020	Is it a fake wall?
6675020	6677020	Not fake wall.
6677020	6679020	What?
6684020	6687020	I've been dumb and I'm just to cut the...
6688020	6693020	Wait, did I interact with the front?
6697020	6699020	Huh.
6699020	6702020	Sealed and obscured by a shadow.
6702020	6705020	You have to proceed elsewhere.
6705020	6707020	Okay.
6707020	6714020	We can't progress at this castle area.
6714020	6718020	So we will...
6718020	6723020	We'll go across the bridge.
6723020	6725020	We've not gone across the bridge.
6725020	6727020	Go to the three path cross.
6727020	6730020	And then we'll go across the bridge and all that.
6730020	6734020	Same for the reefling flattening.
6734020	6739020	Oh, hello. Do you talk to me?
6739020	6741020	If you've yet to do so.
6742020	6745020	Okay, I have a reefling.
6745020	6748020	Okay, I do my little explore list.
6750020	6753020	Because boss fights don't really count.
6753020	6757020	Because it's just like a whack after a whack.
6757020	6760020	But exploring is like you get to do a lot.
6760020	6764020	Arrow delivery? No way.
6765020	6769020	That's funny as anything.
6769020	6771020	Arrow delivery.
6771020	6773020	Oh, I need an enemy reefling to come here.
6773020	6777020	If anyone's at the three path cross.
6779020	6782020	Reefling flattening, more like reefling,
6782020	6785020	flapping in, am I right fellas?
6787020	6788020	Thank you.
6788020	6790020	Thank you. Oh, thank you.
6790020	6792020	Okay, I got an enemy reefling too.
6792020	6796020	I don't really know if I should put down the enemy reefling.
6796020	6798020	But I'll just try.
6798020	6800020	Because I guess you get to still adventure.
6800020	6803020	Just because you're like a whack.
6803020	6805020	Boo.
6805020	6807020	Oh, you want pre-ritual?
6807020	6810020	Does arrow delivery want pre-ritual?
6815020	6819020	That arrow delivery guy just like actually.
6819020	6823020	Holy, Rainbow Stone Shattered Bloodborne Fletch.
6823020	6825020	Did we do Fletching up in here?
6825020	6827020	4000 Fletch.
6827020	6829020	Oh, someone actually said that.
6829020	6832020	They were hoping I'd do more RuneScape after.
6832020	6834020	Okay, we got the pre-ritual down.
6834020	6836020	Oh my God.
6836020	6837020	Did you just...
6837020	6840020	I've got a Gollum Great Boat Crab.
6844020	6846020	Look at me.
6846020	6848020	You want to lie down too?
6848020	6850020	Reefling?
6850020	6852020	Oh, you're dropping stuff for me.
6852020	6854020	More bones.
6854020	6856020	So many bones.
6856020	6858020	Eh, bones.
6858020	6859020	Sorry, not bones.
6859020	6861020	Sorry, one of them has bones in the tail.
6861020	6862020	Ready?
6862020	6864020	Let's do a big run up.
6864020	6866020	Because we did fantastic on that boss fight.
6871020	6873020	Perfect.
6873020	6875020	I will just hold on to...
6875020	6877020	Oh, he went for it.
6877020	6878020	A fire dra...
6878020	6880020	Oh, talisman.
6880020	6882020	Hold on.
6882020	6888020	Are these talisman go together and...
6888020	6889020	Wait, hold on.
6889020	6890020	Equipment.
6890020	6891020	Talisman.
6891020	6895020	Are these complimentary to the bolts?
6895020	6901020	Nay fire and nay magic against me.
6901020	6902020	That...
6902020	6905020	Honestly, that seems pretty good at the line.
6905020	6906020	Oh, more.
6906020	6909020	Oh, an arrow talisman for when we do bosses.
6909020	6911020	I'll swap when we do bosses.
6911020	6914020	Okay, we need to...
6914020	6918020	go across the bridge, which Reefling's already done working with.
6918020	6921020	I have to get some drinks next, actually.
6921020	6923020	Didn't expect so many clips from yesterday.
6923020	6925020	Azura's wanting to lick your face.
6925020	6928020	Bruh, I was like, how steaming is she?
6928020	6931020	But I think everyone's good to go.
6931020	6935020	Speaking of everyone being good to go, how dare they?
6937020	6942020	Oh, okay, hold on.
6942020	6945020	Hold on, I have something funny to show you.
6945020	6946020	Are you ready?
6946020	6947020	Sorry for your...
6947020	6948020	I'm fucking charred.
6948020	6950020	I'm not even going to pretend.
6950020	6951020	I'm not even going to pretend.
6951020	6953020	I'm absolutely dying.
6953020	6955020	But like, the good came to die and not the bad came.
6955020	6957020	Like, I want to be here came to die.
6957020	6958020	Are you ready for this?
6958020	6963020	You know how we're playing Belcher next week?
6963020	6964020	Yeah.
6967020	6968020	What do you think?
6968020	6971020	I'm going to get those assets and use them.
6971020	6974020	What would you think for a thumbnail?
6974020	6976020	Mummy's betting the hoot.
6976020	6981020	My poor little Reeflings are going to either be in a cardboard box or not.
6981020	6984020	It's time to...
6984020	6986020	Well, it's time to...
6986020	6987020	Belcher.
6987020	6988020	Belcher.
6988020	6990020	Belcher doesn't really work.
6990020	6991020	Belcher.
6991020	6992020	Any Belcher?
6992020	6994020	I'm a Belcher.
6994020	6996020	That's pretty good.
6996020	6999020	Mummy's going to be spending all the milk money.
6999020	7001020	Let's go.
7001020	7002020	I like that.
7002020	7004020	Come back because you dodged.
7004020	7005020	Dome.
7005020	7006020	Dome.
7006020	7007020	Dome.

7041020	7042020	Dome.
7042020	7046020	Maybe it's a warning to not actually come here.
7046020	7050020	Lost ashes of war.
7050020	7060020	Okay, we appear to be doing a bit of pillaging.
7060020	7064020	There's actual things with humanity.
7064020	7070020	I'm helping, I'm helping, I'm not even gonna hit yet, I'm helping, I'm helping.
7070020	7076020	I'm putting my great sword on right now.
7076020	7080020	It has so much more reach.
7080020	7084020	Scottish English seems to be its own language.
7084020	7088020	I have such good news for you.
7088020	7092020	No, the British government acknowledges it.
7092020	7096020	Fire spark perfume bottle.
7096020	7098020	Someone's getting hurt.
7098020	7102020	Wait, Arrow Delivery is getting hurt. Where's Arrow? Help Arrow!
7102020	7108020	Why? Okay, he's dead.
7108020	7110020	Oh, another item.
7110020	7116020	Ooh, a skadoot leaf fragment.
7116020	7118020	What, when did this game get to French?
7118020	7122020	Skadoot leaf.
7122020	7126020	How did I manage to claim that when you were so close?
7126020	7128020	Oh no, you're getting boring.
7128020	7132020	Anyone want some calamari?
7132020	7134020	Perfume bottles are weapon?
7134020	7138020	Oh my god, this is such a girl's game.
7138020	7144020	Oh, no, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
7144020	7148020	It's just a harder one that's in the main area.
7148020	7150020	He's got armor.
7150020	7152020	Why is he looking at me? I'm getting nervous.
7152020	7154020	Okay, that's what I wanted to see.
7154020	7156020	Oh no, you made him fall down.
7156020	7158020	He's embarrassed.
7158020	7164020	He's going to think about this moment for the rest of his life because he fell down in front of us.
7164020	7168020	Wah.
7168020	7170020	Wah.
7170020	7176020	I'm out of stamina. Hold on, let me get to it.
7176020	7180020	Wah. Oh wait, we got a critical?
7180020	7182020	Oh, we got a critical, alright.
7183020	7185020	Wah.
7185020	7186020	He's so stumpy.
7186020	7188020	Okay, we did it, we did it.
7188020	7192020	Woah, that's not friendly.
7192020	7199020	I got a somber smithing stone from his body.
7199020	7204020	Wait, you can actually farm crafting heroes now?
7204020	7209020	A shadow realm rune.
7209020	7212020	Yeah, so grossly the bosses claim weird personality.
7212020	7214020	I regret ascending that.
7214020	7216020	Honestly, true.
7216020	7221020	When have we never regretted a few cheeky comments?
7221020	7222020	Then you overthink it.
7222020	7224020	When you go to bed tonight, we be fun.
7224020	7231020	Then you'd be like, remember that time I did that cringe message in Stony's chat.
7231020	7234020	Then you worry.
7234020	7238020	And then when you do think of it, just giggle because I'm giggling with you.
7240020	7242020	Oh my god, a stagger timber there.
7243020	7245020	Woah, woah, woah!
7245020	7247020	Am I going crazy?
7248020	7252020	I need better armor yesterday.
7256020	7259020	Wait, so you can finally farm crafting heroes?
7259020	7261020	Is there something up here?
7261020	7262020	Oh my god!
7262020	7265020	The name's McCree, Jesse McCree.
7265020	7267020	It's Harmu.
7267020	7268020	I'm playing Fatball.
7268020	7271020	Sorry, sorry, I'm playing Fatball, a weed dust thing that are real.
7271020	7273020	I thought those things weren't real.
7273020	7274020	Is it tumbleweeds?
7274020	7275020	Yeah, tumbleweeds.
7275020	7277020	I thought tumbleweeds weren't real.
7280020	7282020	What's inside?
7282020	7283020	What?
7283020	7285020	Inside the box.
7287020	7288020	Milady?
7288020	7290020	Oh, that's so cool.
7291020	7292020	Milady.
7292020	7294020	Come, Milady, come, come, Milady.
7294020	7296020	Give me a sugar flat.
7297020	7299020	Then a McCree, right?
7299020	7300020	Jesse McCree.
7301020	7303020	Wait, no, the meme!
7303020	7307020	I don't have a hat that will go dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk on the thing.
7308020	7310020	Oh well, we tried.
7313020	7315020	Tips for Dora, Milady.
7315020	7320020	The lion head is cool and it gives like five strength and dexterity, but it debuffs here.
7320020	7321020	I don't know that.
7322020	7325020	What's the naughty thing that it does to you?
7326020	7327020	Why?
7327020	7329020	I thought that was an enemy.
7329020	7331020	I thought that was a cheeky enemy, not going to lie.
7332020	7334020	It's coming from an ankle.
7335020	7337020	Are you squiddin' me right now?
7339020	7344020	Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go on to do look more like?
7346020	7347020	What?
7348020	7351020	What did he say?
7352020	7353020	Is that true?
7353020	7354020	Has anyone...
7354020	7356020	Is that an acronym?
7357020	7360020	H-A-R-B-E
7360020	7362020	Part of the...
7362020	7364020	Okay, so it's not an acronym.
7365020	7367020	Are you havin' a stroke?
7368020	7370020	Thank you for the 20s, ask the question.
7370020	7371020	Are you okay?
7372020	7373020	Oh yeah.
7374020	7376020	Carved words.
7376020	7378020	I abandon here the flesh of my body.
7380020	7384020	Oh, I guess that fragment is her body.
7384020	7386020	She's giving body, ary, ary, ary, ary, ary, ary.
7386020	7387020	Yeah, I didn't know that.
7387020	7389020	A lot of people hear that.
7390020	7391020	Yeah, you like that.
7391020	7392020	You like the way I...
7392020	7395020	I have my slave reeflings.
7395020	7397020	They're all the work.
7398020	7400020	They're just so perfect and submissive
7400020	7403020	and carry me and let me hold their hand
7403020	7405020	and praise them and call them a good boy.
7405020	7407020	Yeah, oh, whoa.
7409020	7410020	It's really a...
7410020	7411020	It's like getting the whole...
7411020	7412020	What?
7412020	7415020	I don't know, application, you don't need to be off, it's okay.
7417020	7418020	What?
7418020	7419020	Okay, I think we're safe.
7419020	7421020	Hold on, let me put my wee light on.
7422020	7423020	There we go.
7424020	7425020	He's not having a stroke.
7425020	7427020	Wait, is that an actual sentence structure?
7427020	7428020	It's a really old meme.
7428020	7429020	Oh.
7431020	7432020	What are we?
7432020	7433020	Not this way?
7433020	7434020	Oh no, the reeflings are split.
7434020	7435020	What way are we going?
7435020	7437020	Oh, that's the animal.
7438020	7440020	Right, someone's just gone on the waterfall
7440020	7441020	and another one's gone there.
7441020	7442020	Which way is it?
7442020	7444020	Right, he's got a fire.
7444020	7446020	He says, come this way, he's got a fire reefling.
7446020	7448020	Come reefling, he says he's got a fire.
7449020	7450020	Which way is it?
7450020	7451020	Oh!
7451020	7454020	There's a jump ahead reefling back there.
7454020	7456020	Don't forget to jump, please.
7456020	7457020	Seriously.
7457020	7459020	Oh, to get an item?
7460020	7461020	What is it?
7461020	7463020	I got a starlight shard.
7463020	7465020	Okay, it was just a wee thing.
7465020	7466020	Wee.
7466020	7467020	Wee.
7467020	7469020	Okay, I got it, I got it.
7469020	7470020	One at a time.
7470020	7471020	Single fail, people.
7471020	7472020	Single fail.
7472020	7473020	This is a cliff face.
7473020	7474020	What makes you think we should go
7474020	7476020	three by three on the side?
7476020	7477020	You know what I'm saying?
7478020	7479020	Single fail.
7479020	7480020	Easy.
7480020	7481020	Easy.
7481020	7482020	Easy.
7482020	7483020	Take it easy.
7484020	7485020	Easy.
7486020	7487020	Easy.
7487020	7489020	This is more dangerous than the time we went
7489020	7491020	in the coffin down a waterfall.
7491020	7493020	Oh, there's a wee turtle.
7493020	7494020	Hello.
7494020	7495020	Hello.
7495020	7496020	I pet the turtle.
7496020	7498020	I pet it, I pet it.
7499020	7500020	So cute.
7500020	7501020	Okay, sorry, sorry.
7501020	7503020	Okay, we're doing a Legend of Zelda movement.
7503020	7505020	We're going behind the waterfall.
7505020	7506020	I'll go over there.
7506020	7508020	There is some sort of item here.
7509020	7511020	Why has a...
7511020	7514020	Drawstring Royal Magic Hickory?
7514020	7517020	Not to be confused with fake magic.
7517020	7518020	Peasant?
7519020	7520020	Wait, why is there a fake?
7520020	7521020	Oh, it's because of me.
7521020	7522020	Sorry.
7523020	7524020	Doll.
7524020	7525020	Doll.
7525020	7526020	I pet the doll.
7527020	7528020	As in the turtle.
7528020	7529020	I pet the doll.
7530020	7532020	I need to not do like combat actions,
7532020	7533020	because that accidentally triggers
7533020	7535020	aggressive music.
7536020	7538020	Could you imagine?
7539020	7540020	If...
7540020	7542020	If I could turn off and reading.
7542020	7544020	Wow, what a bizarre concept.
7544020	7545020	Truly.
7545020	7547020	I'm so sorry the dev team didn't even
7547020	7548020	think of it until now,
7548020	7549020	but I had to...
7549020	7551020	Someone had to break the news to them.
7551020	7553020	Well, we're looking at that.
7553020	7554020	That's a hassle.
7554020	7557020	Oh my god, we're making flower.
7557020	7558020	Push it.
7560020	7562020	Oh, you guys don't want to help.
7562020	7564020	You're making it heavier.
7566020	7568020	Oh my god, it's like a real cal...
7568020	7569020	Wait.
7569020	7571020	Why did we open it and then go up here?
7574020	7576020	I don't know who the fuck I'm beating up.
7576020	7578020	I'm beating the shit out of everyone.
7578020	7580020	Leave my replay alone.
7582020	7583020	I love the delay.
7583020	7585020	Like, I do it and then he's like...
7586020	7588020	A few seconds later.
7589020	7591020	That's a good order.
7596020	7597020	Wow.
7598020	7600020	Oh, not magic in him, but magic.
7602020	7603020	Oh, come on.
7603020	7605020	That makes me come out and around.
7605020	7607020	Not even Wednesday, though.
7607020	7609020	No, wait a minute.
7610020	7612020	Gotta wait for the stream delay.
7615020	7617020	This is what you guys are playing with.
7617020	7618020	Whoa, whoa.
7618020	7619020	What?
7619020	7620020	What?
7620020	7621020	What?
7621020	7622020	What?
7622020	7624020	This is what you guys are playing with.
7624020	7625020	Whoa, whoa.
7629020	7631020	Did I miss something?
7634020	7635020	Did I miss something?
7635020	7636020	Was I not full health?
7636020	7638020	Was I like 1 HP or something?
7640020	7643020	Or is he all attack, no health?
7643020	7645020	Did I miss something?
7645020	7646020	Was I weak?
7652020	7654020	I just got one shot?
7658020	7659020	Um...
7660020	7661020	What?
7662020	7663020	I got one shot?
7663020	7666020	Where the fuck are we on the HUD?
7666020	7668020	We're on Castle Enius checkpoint.
7669020	7672020	Are you guys okay if I make a quick cup of tea?
7674020	7676020	There's 80% health on a single...
7676020	7678020	Literally, I blinked when I was dead.
7678020	7680020	I was like, oh, there's an enemy.
7681020	7682020	Um...
7682020	7684020	Got absolutely fucking rolled.
7685020	7686020	Um...
7686020	7687020	Me...
7688020	7690020	You were actually the enemy.
7690020	7692020	Whoa, no, no.
7692020	7693020	Sorry.
7693020	7694020	Uh...
7694020	7695020	When you do this on a movie,
7695020	7697020	don't do three books at the same time.
7697020	7700020	Alright, you've not done a main quest with me.
7701020	7703020	Just rushing around...
7703020	7705020	For somebody to...
7711020	7713020	You've not had a main quest.
7713020	7715020	Ooh, lollygagging with you.
7716020	7718020	We're doing lollygagging with you.
7719020	7721020	Arrow, you were just with us.
7721020	7722020	Oh wait, no!
7722020	7723020	Idiot.
7724020	7726020	Well, you were both with us.
7726020	7728020	But now you're with me again.
7729020	7730020	Oh my god, mommy, you did it?
7730020	7731020	Yeah?
7731020	7733020	I killed the lion.
7733020	7734020	I did it solo,
7734020	7737020	because the reflins were holding me back.
7737020	7738020	They were being...
7738020	7741020	They just got so distracted by the view, you know?
7741020	7744020	So I had to do it all by myself.
7745020	7748020	And I'm totally not telling you fibbers.
7748020	7749020	At all.
7750020	7754020	I'm telling you the biggest fib I have ever fibbed.
7754020	7757020	Lying women needs immediate refling correction.
7757020	7758020	I didn't see some,
7758020	7759020	I'm just gonna take a word for it.
7759020	7761020	Do not take my word for it.
7761020	7764020	Alright, I'm gonna very quickly make a wee cup of tea.
7764020	7767020	And I'm actually gonna clean out my ears,
7767020	7769020	because I can fucking seal them.
7770020	7771020	The view?
7771020	7774020	That means some refling can see from the back.
7774020	7775020	No, you can see...
7775020	7776020	No, this...
7776020	7778020	This is the view!
7778020	7780020	This right here is the view!
7781020	7783020	Then you can still kinda see it.
7785020	7787020	Right, I'm gonna very quickly make a cup of tea,
7787020	7789020	and get some food.
7789020	7792020	I'll be a four whole minute.
7792020	7794020	Hey, please do get a snack.
7794020	7795020	Please do get a...
7797020	7798020	Get a what?
7798020	7801020	Get a drink and a snack and a stretch.
7804020	7805020	I'll try and wake myself up.
7805020	7806020	I do apologise.
7806020	7808020	It's on my sleepy bambino,
7808020	7810020	but I had terrible sleep last night.
7812020	7816020	Yeah, it turns out I'm trying to like do a few things at once.
7816020	7819020	From Zoom 12 I restreams might not be that viable.
7819020	7823020	But who am I to say no to a cheeky stream?
7823020	7824020	Let's be honest.
7824020	7825020	Who am I to say no?
7826020	7828020	Right, I'll be back in four minutes, okay?
7828020	7831020	Give me four minutes.
7831020	7832020	Okay?
7849020	7851020	Okay.
7879020	7880020	Okay.

8059020	8067020	Are you squiddin' me right now?
8067020	8070020	Are you squiddin' me right now?
8070020	8088020	Are you squiddin' me right now?
8088020	8090020	Are you squidding me right now?
8118020	8120020	Are you squidding me right now?
8128020	8130020	Are you squidding me right now?
8138020	8140020	Are you squidding me right now?
8148020	8150020	Are you squidding me right now?
8178020	8180020	Are you squidding me right now?
8208020	8210020	Are you squidding me right now?
8232020	8234020	I have so much food to serve and really greedy got this.
8234020	8242020	Oh, why are you giving me money? Stop giving me money when I go and, like, friggin' pee and stuff.
8242020	8254020	Thank you, Zarian, I poor. 10 and... 10 and... 10 and... Why do you have a T in the middle of your name?

8264020	8271020	Not Alessandro... Misacabes in chairs. Stop giving me fucking money for doing that and...
8271020	8276520	At least let it be an exchange of, like, you get I get, you know? I like that.
8276520	8281020	Right, my refund's good to go. Where the heck is the other refund? Is he hiding in his...
8281020	8284700	Hey, are you are you the other refund is he hiding it as an item? I
8285900	8289640	Knew you were freaking hiding as an item. I knew it
8290340	8294720	You're so silly. You're so predictable a lot of people and we're on the same wavelength
8296220	8298220	right um, I
8298860	8306220	Don't know how we on earth we defeat that guard. Do we just keep trying at the guard or?
8308500	8310500	What's the story about him
8311020	8315020	Oh my god, they drop Smith it you can literally farm smithing stones. Oh
8317260	8319900	I mean, I guess that makes sense why they introduced a new
8322220	8325860	Like smithing mechanic in this DLC area because you guys told me it's
8331860	8335700	Never learn it's because it's freaking out the piano
8335700	8341860	If you want to hear it in Scott because you're super chatted
8342740	8346940	It's pen in in scots. Yes pronounced pen in
8348180	8353240	All right, what's going on? We're not going up to him right fuck on me. We're going around here. Oh
8354980	8356740	Okay
8356740	8360380	Are we rethink predictable or my program do that? Well?
8361100	8367240	What programming you don't remember any programming because I made sure you wouldn't remember any programming
8375140	8377860	Oh, this guy has like no poise whatever
8378980	8384700	He cannot take this absolute thrashing wait, why am I thinking so much damage?
8385220	8388900	Are these not easy enemies am I gonna I'm not I'm losing it
8389700	8391700	I'm genuinely
8393700	8400620	Oh, he dropped bolts, I guess you can farm them for bolts if you ever needed them right now. We're going for the night. Oh
8405300	8411700	No, no, this can't be right. He's one hit. So how the fuck do we do this?
8419020	8421020	I
8429100	8433340	Does one hit leaves doesn't explain that friendly fire
8436660	8440020	Fuck he like wallops me when I'm trying to get a lick in
8442580	8445740	Okay, we're okay. We're okay. We're okay. We're okay. We're okay. We can do it
8446700	8449540	Right he doesn't have poise against a great sword that's good
8450420	8452420	We things are just sleeper agent
8453780	8455780	What's that black rock head
8456940	8458940	We shouldn't jump
8458940	8464580	But then again, oh you need intelligence to hold a sword. Yeah, I don't think so
8470300	8474260	Maybe not hold on maybe not hold on there's some fighting going on out here. We need help
8475740	8477740	Okay, I helped I helped the fight
8479340	8481340	Wow, I love

8740740	8742740	I
8744420	8750460	Will sometimes they give you a really pitiful size bite and you're like, bro
8754980	8761260	My saying doesn't seem to show up. Are you got multiple your reef link and your own PC at reef? Sorry and your own PC
8761460	8763460	I
8767740	8769740	Will give you a pitiful size
8773140	8775140	Oh, I don't think they like that
8780180	8782180	Yep
8785180	8789500	Oh my god, have you ever had apple coleslaw the homemade apple coleslaw is so good
8791780	8793780	I
8795580	8801580	Mean as fast as cat it'll be a lot faster than the naturals I had yesterday. I promise actually I've only got a few bites
8805820	8807820	And the naturals are so messy
8821260	8823260	Oh
8829180	8831820	Person size should make you fat or sad
8835540	8837540	I don't know why
8837580	8839980	But fried chicken absolutely made them
8840820	8847660	Like American fried chicken though. I cannot wait to try it. I don't know. I like I watch a lot of food videos
8848500	8854220	And there's something about American fried chicken that just looks crazy. Did you say apple coleslaw? Yes, I'm not kidding
8854220	8856220	It's so nice and sweet
8859660	8861660	He's got meal and for friends
8864660	8867500	We have another 18 hours this time
8867500	8869500	I
8876780	8882380	Surprisingly the burger lasted I don't know how they do it, but
8883820	8891740	This is another conspiracy non-conspiracy, I don't really actually mind and I'm like convinced they somehow figured out that heating up
8891740	8896140	Take away makes it taste worse, but having a fresh makes it better
8898500	8905020	Your mouth animation. Yeah, like if my jaw goes down too much because I'm chewing my jaw goes down
8905020	8908540	So when I eat my mouth is closed, but my model's like
8916300	8918300	A little big paper
8919460	8923700	First food taste better. No say it's not real. I can't be true
8928500	8930500	No way, I know
8932540	8938180	But why can't it why can't it taste as good?
8941620	8943300	Hmm
8943300	8945300	That's a good point
8945300	8948180	So food can marinate and taste better the next day
8948420	8954340	One of the biggest examples is like just your average spaghetti dish or like a pasta dish
8954580	8958540	The next day because the flavor like infuses better with the pasta
8967540	8969020	Oh
8969020	8975180	No, you can tell when I stuff my mouth too big because I go like the model makes the face
8978420	8980420	Instead it's just the regular
8980780	8983140	Okay, I'm halfway through the burger. I'm almost done
8984340	8986340	Oh
8990380	8992380	My teeth are so full
8995940	9001660	Thank you to friends on how the degradation of works in the chemical reactions of the food in the boss
9009140	9011460	Spaghetti always tastes better the next day
9015340	9017340	I
9021780	9027740	This is the thing with tomato dishes deep in the flavor look guys get it all sharing our not wait
9027740	9033060	Why are we lying out on the table? What's going on here? Is this the dungeon? Are we in a dungeon right now?
9034780	9036780	That kind of dungeon
9040780	9042780	Cute hamster women
9045340	9050820	Want to see how much I can fit in my mouth want to see it again
9065700	9067700	And our behind-the-scenes question
9068700	9072060	But does watching a ball at times to impact the watch that?
9072060	9074060	I'm
9074300	9076300	negligible
9076700	9078500	negligible so
9078500	9082300	The YouTube if it's a two-hour bot and you watch it on times two
9082660	9088740	YouTube will give you will give me one hour of watch time for that even though you consumed at all
9090820	9097340	But it's better that you did that right then not watching it at all like it doesn't make a difference in terms of thing
9097340	9103940	The only thing it would make a difference in is ASMR content for some reason the way the ads work on ASMR content
9105500	9110580	And how it gets recommended I was a bit different. I don't know why I'm gone
9112540	9120500	The longer someone watches an ASMR video from start to finish the more it's gonna get recommended because YouTube go
9120500	9122820	Oh people watch this from start to end good
9123260	9125260	I
9129420	9133820	Hamster girl for gender. No, I have recent agency came out where we hamster
9152820	9154820	I
9169060	9171540	Watching ASMR in times to speed would be weird
9179060	9181060	That's basically what times two is more
9183620	9185620	I get any further known
9189900	9191900	Get to know fad for this
9193620	9198100	All meat slime ASMR times to brah that would go for a while
9201820	9204820	Gentoo these girls we are strong accent to
9206740	9208740	And
9208740	9210740	No
9212060	9218020	This is where things get a bit interesting because accent are in a major appeal
9218700	9222620	Are I wait once one more bite my burger and I finished it
9239500	9241500	I
9244940	9246940	Reef on doing out there
9248780	9255220	Wow, okay on the topic of accents and feature birds. Yes
9256620	9261700	It's very good at any moment. You can differentiate any girl
9263220	9265220	There's a slight
9265660	9271560	You may argue although this is completely my opinion, but
9272900	9279140	Who goes there identify yourself? I said identify yourself by the Pope and
9280140	9287860	There is possibly an American accent debuff in terms of if they cannot be distinguished
9288660	9290660	now
9290660	9296320	Obviously Azura and she be sound completely different. They have two very distinguishable voices
9298980	9300660	But would
9300660	9307540	Would I want to fill Gen 2 with all Americans? I would be cautious. I would be cautious. I
9308340	9310340	Want a Filipino I
9311140	9314640	Want an English or Welsh possibly? I
9315240	9317240	Want
9317640	9319640	I want
9319680	9321680	Satin of other in Europe
9323360	9325360	Possibly Japanese-speaking I
9325760	9330240	Want but the variety it did did it just burp you unconsciously okay
9331080	9336000	But just because I want does it mean I'm gonna get and please do not if you're lurking in the shadow
9336000	9342600	Please do not think as anyone you cuz I've just said that that's not how it works. I am just saying that I
9343480	9345480	Think accent differentiation
9346840	9348840	specifically in I
9351400	9356600	Guess a vtuber company corporation where we want to call it it's very important
9357800	9359800	Because if someone goes
9360280	9364640	If someone goes all that talent sounds like that talent you're up Shite Creek
9365600	9367600	That's not good
9368600	9370280	And
9370280	9376560	Good morning. Good afternoon or good evening. Oh, it's good morning. Good evening, and then good afternoon in the mess

9386680	9390480	Oh, that's when you put pranks down I was like what the frick is that word again?
9392480	9394480	What European accent in particular
9395240	9396760	I
9396760	9404160	Honestly couldn't be a rat or what country maybe an Espanol maybe a Latina
9405560	9409240	Or a Mexico I wouldn't mind that on the team
9411600	9416000	But if I'm gonna get it who knows it doesn't know fucking

12643120	12645620	Oh, you did fantastic
12648640	12653200	I didn't know when it was gonna drop. I thought I could react in time for the drop
12653280	12656560	But as soon as I see it, I'm just gonna start doing jumping jacks. Okay
12657520	12660480	Oh, that was a fantastic attempt
12663120	12668000	Rishan, were you not just in that? How do you think you're signed down? About time, right? You too had your sign down
12668960	12670960	Major Evelyn can't get a shot
12673520	12675520	Oh, that was such a fantastic
12676160	12680400	Go that was so good. I know you guys can do it like because we got down to there
12680720	12682000	I know
12682000	12684640	For a fact you guys can do it. Phoenix, have you had a shot?
12685600	12687600	I don't think so
12688320	12690320	Jess, did you get a shot?
12691520	12693520	I don't think Phoenix had a shot
12693760	12695760	Let's try it
12697040	12702480	I'm so sorry if you have had a shot and I'm like doing it wrong. I cannot tell you her unbelievably scribbly
12703120	12705280	Where where is the summoning pool?
12706000	12708960	It's not a summoning pool. It's it's this
12709600	12711600	This is where I pick you up from
12712320	12714080	The rest site
12714080	12717840	You put down your marker on the rest site at castle lords chamber
12718400	12720560	And then multiplayer password is reef
12721120	12725920	And then I can see your summoning sign because we share the same multiplayer thing
12732480	12736880	There is none we rate it at the grace yet the mark of grace
12738160	12740960	As long as you're on pc and you have the dlc
12742160	12744560	It cast the lords chambers the enemy
12746880	12748880	Okay, uh, do you want kisses?
12749280	12756160	What kind of oh you no way you both perfectly. Oh, I thought you both perfectly amoted to sit down together. That's funny
12758000	12760000	Are you sitting down?
12760160	12761760	Oh, yeah
12761760	12764640	Oh, yeah, okay. Let's see. Oh, you just want to fit
12766000	12768000	Okay, you have to be blessed
12768080	12774720	To war we go my reef flings. We still have this so I refuse to leave. I know we have this I refuse I refuse
12776400	12779440	But I'm stealing me moves not to drink but down straight
12780400	12783840	Okay, you ready? Okay, no one needs a blessing. We're not blessing
12785280	12787280	Hey, oh, that's nice. That's nice
12791360	12796800	One two third strike, which is delayed, but that's only in phase one
12797040	12800640	Wait, where the fuck are my arrows? Oh, sorry. I suck
12802000	12803680	Oh, no
12803680	12805680	Oh, no, hold on
12806720	12810400	Uh, I am burning through these like nothing on air. Oh crap
12814080	12820160	That's my fire. That's my fire. Don't worry. That's my fire. It's me me doing it
12820800	12823520	Hold on. I'm trying not to get us too close
12823600	12828480	Like I'm trying to give an angle that's opposite of her coming like if she becomes aggro
12828480	12835360	I want her to back away from the reef flings to give them breathing space to heal or to swallow a potion or something
12837200	12841680	But she is not having it. I actually can't I'm covering up her attacks. I think
12842320	12845600	I think I'm stopping you guys from being able to see her
12846160	12848160	Big swing one swing and then a swish
12849040	12851040	Oh, and I jumped right into
12851760	12854800	Of course, I jumped right into it. That'd be too easy
12858640	12862240	I'm wondering should I swap to the other crossbow ball? I feel like I'm like
12863920	12867680	I feel like I'm missing so many I need to be this close to her to do it
12870320	12876960	Okay, that was funny as fuck. Okay phase two phase two jump when you see the snow blue
12877680	12879680	Oh
12880080	12882080	No reef laying
12884000	12887680	Wait, am I empty? Oh my god. I'm empty. Oh my god. I'm empty. Hold on
12889360	12891360	Oh my god, I'm empty
12892320	12894880	I'm freaking burning through everything so quickly
12896720	12898720	I'm trying I'm trying I really am
12900720	12902720	Oh god, no
12907760	12909760	Okay, she's not in her
12912160	12914160	Fuck
12919760	12922160	Hold on give me aggro
12930080	12932080	Fuck you
12937680	12941680	Jump fuck fuck fuck
12945280	12950960	No, my baby reef link didn't make it. No my poor baby
12953360	12957520	Okay, I'm just gonna let her kill me. I don't want to do it without my reef links
12957920	12961760	But we did successfully avoid the ace globes for once
12962400	12966000	I thought I did it way too early, but I guess just jump and go for it
12967440	12973040	Oh my god, we are so gonna do it. I'm sorry. We're like getting so close
12982960	12986640	We're so close we're getting so close but no more arrows
12989440	12995040	Good try. Yeah, listen to the jump smile has everyone who's here had one attempt
12995680	12997680	I don't even see
12998240	13000240	What are you saying?
13001120	13006160	I don't know. I'm just gonna call you say I don't think says had a shot. How are we looking over here?
13008000	13010320	I don't think you've had a shot of this one
13013840	13017680	I mean, I don't think in general what face and what a name
13019760	13022080	I'm wondering I don't want to go to heavy
13022800	13024320	Without
13024320	13026960	Wait, how is that better for me than what I'm wearing?
13027840	13029840	what
13029920	13032420	Am I wearing like absolutely terrible ropes?
13038800	13043360	I'll oh it's turning my poise down. Wait, that puts my poise up
13048800	13050800	But my immunity goes down
13052800	13060240	Wait, hold on. I don't know how clothes work in this game. Okay, that's the best gloves over the best trousers I can have
13061680	13064080	I'm still a medium loads putting these on
13066880	13068960	Point up but look at the weight. Yeah
13072560	13076640	What was the negative thing this beast head did? I can't remember I can't recall
13078400	13081120	I mean everything I have is better than that
13081680	13085360	It's sorry the beast head is the best but I can still I'm still medium and stuff
13087440	13089840	Yeah, I've got you posing
13091840	13094580	That's what my whole looks like after the convention
13099360	13102080	Freel quick. Oh you you have items for me
13102960	13104160	Oh
13104160	13110820	Okay, I'll use my other crossbow this time. Are you ready? Three two one
13111280	13113280	Yeah
13113600	13116640	All right, let's see about using these more
13118080	13120080	Uh crazier
13120640	13122640	Ballista, let's try a ballista
13124720	13128240	I have 99 bird causes
13129200	13131200	Bird fair bar
13131920	13135920	Okay, that causes a loss of blood. Oh wait, is it this one I want to do with it?
13137360	13139360	Uh
13141920	13143920	Huh
13146160	13152400	I mean I'll try it. Well, give her a light one. Give her a bone. You're my bone
13154080	13157040	I already did it. Yeah, goober. I'll already uh
13158960	13163760	You can get kissing sit and you kiss it. Are you ready?
13163840	13171440	Uh the ballista needs great bolts. Okay. I have great bolts one surely surely. That's why I just go on. Yeah
13172880	13174880	Are they both these great bolts?
13176240	13180320	Why do video games give you items that are scarce if you never want to use them?
13181760	13183760	Because they are so scarce
13184160	13186160	Oh
13191600	13197600	I missed aha take that I missed. Hold on. Let me grab my tools
13202480	13204480	Uh
13205440	13209440	Okay, I am very tempted to go back to me crossbow
13210160	13213280	Okay, there we go. Did they even do any damage?
13214720	13216720	I don't even think they did anything
13218720	13220720	This is doing nothing
13222480	13224480	Am I going mental?
13225600	13228080	Hold on. Well, let me try to look at the HP bar
13230240	13232240	That's 400 it does
13232560	13238800	Sorry. Yeah, I'm like losing all mobility trying to use this ballista. I'm sorry. I'm losing all my mobility
13239760	13242880	Hold on. Let me swap out. You're doing great sweetie. Keep it up
13243760	13245760	Keep going darlin
13245840	13252320	Um, I don't want to use the rapid fire, but I have so much more damage. I'm not going arrow. It's actual bow and arrow
13252400	13254400	How do I use this?
13255280	13260080	No, I don't have bows. Hold on. I do have bows like one of these
13261520	13263520	Some of these that one
13264080	13266160	No
13266160	13268160	Oh, it's fucking purple
13269120	13278720	It's why did it you aim for her head? Oh, come on
13282960	13284960	Does that even do anything?
13288880	13290880	Uh, I'm definitely getting off of her
13293520	13295520	I feel like this is just the best way to go
13295520	13297520	Oh
13297600	13302320	I'm like not I'm not wasting as much ammo as well because if I miss I'm into
13306320	13308320	I rolled into it
13309680	13311200	He rolled twice
13311200	13316960	Right here, and I'm like not taking any aggro right now if I'm not fucking them. Yeah, sorry. I just completely
13317840	13321040	I was experimenting. I didn't experiment very well
13326240	13328240	Okay
13331200	13333200	Okay
13336080	13339680	I was far too early on that one. I knew exactly what I did wrong
13341600	13344000	Ah, are you dead? No, you're alive
13347920	13349920	How did that hit me?
13350240	13352240	Oh
13359200	13361200	I've used my wonders to beat
13366320	13374160	Oh, whoa, whoa, see that aggro swap is what I can't keep up with one hold on let me heal
13375040	13377040	Oh
13380480	13383040	Ah, okay, okay, okay about the souls are gotten that up
13387840	13389840	I think the shotgun
13389840	13392960	Crossbow the one that goes like it does a lot
13393760	13395760	Finally gets attached around you
13397520	13399520	Let's go
13401120	13403120	Solid fight not bad
13403600	13408000	They aren't that scarce. You just can't carry a lot at once. There's a lot less than your bleed though
13409040	13411040	So just focus on
13411600	13414720	Right spray bleed. That's all I need to do spray bleed
13416720	13418720	I'm still very um
13420480	13424640	Leap, leap, leap. The replant has given me tons of bleed. Literally all the bleed
13426240	13428800	Oh wait, I'm using a bow aren't I not an arrow?
13429920	13431920	That's an arrow. I need
13432480	13434480	I need what barbed bolts
13435120	13437120	Yeah
13438560	13442400	Uh, I'm not poison as well. You guys have oh that one has it
13445920	13448560	Okay, I'll do I'll do
13450320	13452560	This is really cool boss. I look forward to hating
13453600	13457280	Facing her. Wow. Oh good. The reinforcements are here
13458400	13460880	Uh, you is there anyone here who hasn't had a show?
13462720	13464720	Barrette?
13466720	13470800	Barrette hasn't had a show. I don't think I can't see
13477520	13480720	Suru you did have a show. Phoenix he says
13482560	13485200	Taku? You've not had a show
13485920	13487920	Oh
13490720	13492720	We'll drop you bolts. Don't you worry. Okay
13494000	13498640	Not only do I get in-game currency and game this and game that I also get in-game bulk
13499760	13501760	Are you a dom?
13502400	13504800	Something domey somethings mommy
13505760	13507760	Look at their tables
13508560	13512080	I don't like that. No kings. All weaklings are easy
13515280	13518640	Okay, we do kisses
13520080	13526240	Oh, oh, that's exactly what I needed. Let's go. All right. We're ready to do the boss
13531360	13540000	Oh, okay, that's exactly what I needed not even telling me. Okay. Let's do it. Let's go. Do you guys need to do any spells or incantations?
13540880	13543200	I don't think so you guys look like melee boys
13543760	13549920	Okay. Oh, no. Wait. We're getting praised. I missed it. Oh, wait. Did that hit me? It hit me. I still got it
13559360	13561360	Is there no way to zoom in on that?
13564720	13568400	Well, I guess it's closer I get and the more I can spray into her
13568800	13575040	But the more she can also do such a thing like that
13590560	13594400	Right into right into I seem to always go into that sword now
13594560	13596560	Oh
13596880	13598880	This is a bit like it's scary
13601280	13604080	When she can just do that
13608400	13613680	Phase two warning phase two warning. I can't take aggro without
13616160	13618160	Okay, phase two warning achieved
13618160	13620160	I
13628320	13630320	I'm trying to take aggro. I'm I'm
13631920	13635760	Oh, shit. I'm taking too much aggro. I took too much aggro
13636640	13639520	I wasn't prepared for that like left off there
13640240	13642240	Ah
13645040	13647680	That's so much bleed it's working though
13648560	13653760	Shotgun cross will burn both so fast. I think I should just do the singular one
13654960	13656960	I think you're right
13661840	13664560	But it's doing so much like we're getting so close
13666320	13668320	I don't know. Let me go again
13669120	13671120	Let me go again. Let me go again. All right, hold on
13672000	13674320	Can you feel like you had a shot of this by four?
13675520	13677520	Now don't think you had a shot of her
13681440	13685440	Anyone here who hasn't had a shot about fucking time
13687040	13689040	Hi lords, did you get a shot of this guy?
13690320	13692320	I'll read your name
13693280	13695280	I
13698000	13700000	Think
13708640	13714480	Watching you play the cross will makes me want to play a cross will build the cross will hardly does any damage at all
13715360	13718640	Oh, do you want to princess carry me through the game? Sure? You can
13723200	13730720	Yeah, the hit probability is higher which is causing the bleed if bleed does 10% full health damage
13731280	13733280	It just seems so worth it. You know
13734080	13736080	Are you guys ready?
13736160	13738160	up
13741760	13743760	Well, we get to it
13744400	13746400	Wait, I am convinced
13746400	13750320	With my reeflings anything is possible and I know for a fact we can do this
13752560	13755360	You're running out of bolts and landing

15142160	15144880	Just to see if we can maybe hear cues a bit more
15145440	15149840	She summons imps only for the scorpions. I believe that because
15150640	15154480	Sen cannot stand like bugs, insects, all that kind of thing
15155360	15157360	Yeah, and we're doing a gluck gluck circle
15161520	15168640	I'm doing solo, but oh my god, the scorpions in that castle tried to get imps to clear them out because it wouldn't work because the lion boss was dead. Oh

15191600	15193600	Let's
15194000	15200160	Let's get her bowl bear. I said, let's get her bowl bearings. Right. Hold on. Let's just
15200960	15203360	I say what's going on and then we can start firing
15209840	15211840	Okay
15212960	15215840	Okay, bleach seems to be the way to kill this night
15216720	15221840	Oh, wait, sorry, I was freaking loading
15226880	15228880	The acres on me
15231280	15236320	We're gonna go for the cheeky bleeds. Oh, we got bleeds. We got bleeds. We got big bleeds there
15237520	15239520	Oh fantastic
15240240	15245840	Okay, bleeds is the way to go against this character. There's um, I cannot be
15248640	15254560	Why are you getting so full right jump wait in odd? Why did I jump?
15256320	15260080	I don't know why I jumped I meant dodge and then wait and then jump
15260880	15262560	And if we know
15262560	15264560	I know what I mean. I can't say it right right now
15265120	15267120	Who's she looking at?
15267200	15269200	She's looking at me
15270240	15272240	And one more for luck
15277360	15282160	Okay, let's see if we can get another bleach soon tm. Oh, not on me though
15283920	15285920	Oh, not on me though
15286880	15291200	Yeah, see that change it's so volatile that change in aggro is just
15291760	15295760	It's almost unpredictable because it looks like she's not even gonna charge off or dude
15296320	15301600	How does that always hit? Do I need to roll into it or like roll directly forward into it possibly?
15302240	15304240	Or roll directly backwards
15305920	15307920	I'm gonna feel like he oh
15308880	15311280	Okay, okay. Okay. We're cooking
15313760	15315760	We're cooking
15316080	15319040	Let's see if I can get a bleed for these fucking bow and arrows
15320240	15322240	So I'm not the useless
15322240	15325600	Well, I'm pretty useless, but you know what I mean, you know what I mean
15340800	15346800	That was it that was the fucking run and all I had to do was dodge some blue lights
15347360	15350720	Man, all I had to do was dodge some blood and legs
15353040	15359120	I like bugs in real life, but the ones in gains are overkill. The scuttle says bro. I ran past that entire section
15359120	15363680	I missed off a stat. I was to pick up something out of statue and I completely like ignored it
15366400	15369840	Uh, Jess did I get you Henry? I don't think I get Jess back in again
15371840	15375120	Uh, Taku and Jess you're gonna be my joy this time
15375520	15377520	I
15377920	15384160	Hope everyone's got a bleed build brought back the images of how those baby scurfs playing to their mama and whores
15384560	15387040	It's kind of weird that you wouldn't think instinct
15387760	15391280	Like instincts and bugs kind of have that thing going for them, but uh
15393920	15397440	That is good gotta roll through it anything else you just don't clear
15397520	15401440	Yeah, it's like I got a roll like right forward into that big swipe. She does
15402400	15405600	So we know we now know her biggest weakness
15406320	15408320	buzz
15408320	15410320	with our bug
15412160	15414400	Okay, hopefully you two are on
15415440	15417440	bleed
15420800	15422400	Uh
15422400	15425760	What's he doing? He's gonna be crying chan. What does this say?
15426640	15428640	Freeze the pincer attack
15429760	15432880	Over again blast. We have been blessed. Let's go
15434400	15439680	Let's do it. Let's do it 20 minute adventure reeflings
15443040	15450240	Right, I'm fucking falling asleep clearly. I've had enough clearly. I've had enough because I'm falling asleep getting attacked by the easy
15456480	15460400	I take aggro to give that reefing some space
15466160	15468960	Yeah, they get locked into that attack which is fine with me
15476560	15478560	Right heel heel mother
15486560	15488560	You know
15488880	15492080	Oh, we got a hit we got a hit that was a big chunk whatever that was
15492240	15495520	I don't know if that was a bleed or not. I see frost damage though
15496720	15498240	My game crashed
15498240	15500240	My game crashed. Hello
15501120	15503120	My game literally just crashed
15503600	15505600	I'm back though. I like just pause
15506640	15508640	Did you guys see that?
15509520	15511520	Are you teabagging?
15511840	15513840	Oh my god, did you see that though?
15514800	15520400	I'm surprised we're even still here. I thought that the thing was gonna explode. Sorry. I'm not paying attention
15521040	15523040	die
15523680	15529520	Oh god, I the one I would have died if I didn't dodge that. I'm not gonna lie. I think I would have been born
15535840	15542320	Oh, yeah, oh, sorry, I was uh, I never pay attention to that attack. Honestly. Sorry, my dumb ass fall asleep
15542560	15544800	I am I may as well be asleep right now
15547200	15550960	I'm gonna feel health. I just don't like having more health
15552000	15555840	Considering how easy it is to get one shot if I am
15556640	15557600	well
15557600	15559600	Two in a wee bit of short
15565840	15567840	Oh
15572480	15578720	See when I can take aggro like that, it's fantastic for the reason we need to like move in and just have our ease
15580640	15582640	If I can keep aggro
15583600	15587840	Okay, one swing wait swing again. Oh, we finally did it
15590000	15592000	Finally
15593520	15596400	Oh, no, no, no, no, no
15597920	15600980	Are you both dead? Oh, don't be so selfish
15602480	15604480	Don't be so selfish
15607600	15610000	You haven't managed to live long enough to run out of healing
15611040	15613040	So you're good to keep going
15613600	15616400	It's a ration healing when the problem is restrained easy
15617040	15621920	Did you know that performance drops after the four hour mark? It doesn't matter if it's physical or mental
15622640	15624160	I am
15624160	15628880	But if I don't have to perform when the reef links are carrying man, it doesn't count
15629840	15634880	And we go again, right? How about that? I'm not allowed to go to sleep until we went against this boss
15635200	15639920	That seems like a fair go. I'm trying to remember who I've not had in the longest
15641120	15643120	I'm trying I'm trying
15644640	15649200	I think you and you haven't been in the longest
15652560	15654560	It's all our fault no
15654880	15658160	The internet killed me. Literally my fucking thing
15659120	15662080	So today was the first time I got summoned in this game ever
15662160	15664000	I didn't know I would have
15664000	15670320	Half my heels and I guess it kind of scales the damage of the boss. It's also kind of hard even missing it. Oh, no, it is like
15671600	15677440	I suck at the game and I basically have two reef links that are nerfed into the ground to help me
15678400	15686000	Okay, if there is a big gigger Chad Elton player come now so she can go to sleep. Oh, you send me a bed
15688400	15695760	Are you ready? Are you ready? Oh, you're here to carry me like literally and figuratively in the game
15697920	15704400	Boss gains 20 damage and 50 health per extra player. Wait, am I really nervous am I making a words for myself?
15708080	15710080	Someone get let me solo her
15714000	15716000	Okay, just felt
15717280	15722640	Wait, why did that go through me? Am I going crazy? I did nothing to dodge that and it didn't hurt me
15724480	15726480	I think I'm losing it
15726880	15728160	unless
15728160	15729920	sorry
15729920	15733360	My performance is going down. I repeat my performance is going down
15734240	15738320	We have hit the performance mark
15741120	15743760	Holy crap, just throwing knives. Is that throwing knives?
15746160	15748160	You're making me want to use throwing knives
15749680	15756640	Okay, avoid wait avoid. Okay. Avoid wait avoid. That's all I have to do. I'll start start
15756640	15758640	Oh
15761760	15763760	Again they go for me. I didn't expect that
15766400	15772000	That's how to get you don't expect that. Oh, we need to help her. Give me aggro. Give me aggro
15775520	15777520	Wow
15778880	15780880	Give me aggro. I know like this
15780880	15782880	I
15784640	15786640	Was just one
15786640	15789760	It wasn't a five-phase swing. No refling
15790960	15792960	I can't take aggro
15793600	15798640	It's not giving me aggro. I ain't go aggro. Successfully. It's exactly
15806800	15808800	Oh
15810880	15814880	The bluetooth device as uh
15829840	15831840	Oh piss I didn't expect that
15832080	15834080	Oh
15836880	15840720	You guys are doing so well though, you guys are getting so close
15843520	15845520	You guys are doing so well
15848160	15850880	Every time she slips behind me and trashes me
15851840	15856000	Just not just in game, but also out of the carriage into her farm
15857200	15859600	She hits like a truck. Oh, she does like
15860320	15865680	The buffs and the the combo in the second phase is just unforgiving. It really is
15866640	15868640	Mushroom man not had you about
15871920	15873920	Uh russian
15875600	15878720	No, I'm not writing down names anymore. I'm just trying to guess on my head
15879600	15881600	Which is a probably a terrible way to do it
15882320	15889120	Right you two have not seen any of me that edge and ring would fuck. Please. Let me have it this sweet release
15889840	15891840	Honestly though
15897040	15900800	There's no need for this guy for half of your carry story on the farm
15901520	15905520	With all the chickens and the ducks that eat the piss and all the plants that we have
15906560	15908560	The amazing
15908880	15912720	Meanwhile me parrying the black knight downstairs for an hour on y'all
15913440	15915440	Right. Are you ready? Mwah. Mwah
15916080	15918880	We'll see if we get all you carry you offer to carry me
15919440	15925680	Let's see if your actions speak louder than your words. No, no, let's see if your remote speaks louder than your
15926640	15928640	implications
15928800	15932960	Because either it's gonna happen. Are we getting blessed? Oh, we got blessed
15933840	15937360	Blessed to impress forget dressed to impress. We are blessed to prevent
15939680	15941520	Give me these souls
15941520	15942960	Wait, whoa
15942960	15944960	I lost aggro as soon as I came in
15945440	15947440	Oh
15971440	15973440	Oh my god that bleed though
15974000	15976000	Oh my god, I couldn't get her awful
15980320	15987520	Okay, so even though my crossbow doesn't do much damage if I get up leading it's almost like it makes up for the missing damage
15988400	15990400	Does that make any sense whatsoever?
15997760	16002480	We flings remove this woman right now from my game eliminate her
16004080	16006080	She's so hard for no reason
16009440	16011440	Is there anyone that's male?
16014640	16016960	I react far too late
16020960	16024400	The bleed is the prop where your damage is hidden. So you just got to build it up
16025200	16028080	You could also drop her could could this
16029440	16031440	The poison bills might do the trick
16034320	16038560	I haven't been in for a single time. What's your name?
16041360	16043360	In game
16044000	16046000	I'll try and get everyone in
16046800	16048800	Oh, sorry
16049760	16051760	Shadow realm blessing
16053840	16058160	Oh, I don't know why any of that pushes but he will
16058560	16060560	Uh
16063920	16069360	Partially I'm running out of effects. I just have like default bolts, which is fine. It's not problem
16072560	16074640	Upgrade it. Oh my apologies. Sorry
16077200	16079200	Shadow realm blessing sacred tree
16079520	16086400	Consume sacred tree fragments to bolster your blessings the blessing bolsters the acceptance ability to deal and negate damage
16086400	16088880	But has no influence outside of the realm
16089680	16091680	sure
16093920	16095440	For you
16095440	16103360	Reverend spirit the reverence fillet blessing bolsters both summon spirit and spectral speed ability to deal and negate damage
16104880	16109200	Wait, so they were like, okay, we know the game's too hard. So we're going to introduce this
16111520	16113520	That's quite humorous, honestly
16117040	16119040	Uh, it increases damage
16120640	16123200	My name in game is Bella. Hold on
16127280	16133520	Uh, there we go stream sniped you from across the room. I had you
16137280	16139280	Fennec's been in on the whole
16140000	16145200	Yes, you have had in the tent. I think fennec's is the one who's not had a shot in a wee while
16146000	16148000	Unset probably fennec set
16149920	16151920	Okay, fennec and then set next
16152160	16156000	He's not had a hot check and don't turn it back to everyone has had a chance
16157200	16159200	I might hop in and try and parry her
16160320	16166480	I don't know how you guys have the reaction time for a parry. I think the last time I did like a reaction time test
16166560	16168560	I was like 162
16169360	16171360	ms, which wasn't the worst
16172160	16175920	But it wasn't exactly like I'm an elite gamer. I'll need to see what it is now
16175920	16178960	I feel like it's probably going way down like I'm just a tired bean
16179840	16181840	Are you ready?
16182640	16184640	Are you ready?
16184880	16186880	Are you steady?
16191120	16193680	Oh, no, fennec's is suck. Oh, no, he's giving me so
16195680	16197360	Poison
16197360	16200240	Because you're poison. Oh, you give me balls
16202400	16205280	You are giving me bolts. I can put these on bolts
16206560	16207840	bolts
16207840	16209600	and then
16209600	16214000	Poison so we're going to do blood loss and poison on her. Yeah
16214800	16219920	Hell yeah, thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, you got the design mouse for being my sugar daddy in game
16221920	16226720	Ready anyone doing a blessing? No, we look mainly players. So I don't think anyone's done any blessings out here
16228320	16230320	Okay, give me these first
16237680	16239680	Let's try poison
16242960	16245440	Okay, it's not working. That's kind of it
16247040	16250800	I'm going for maybe bleed dammit. No, no poison first
16251680	16253680	and bleed the brick out of her
16254640	16256640	Mate mods
16257360	16260720	Reflings make it to my tomato ketchup seeds inside this woman
16262640	16264640	Hold on. Why does it run flat out?
16267600	16269600	I was just
16275760	16280320	Okay, we've got frost right I'm going for bleed now if I see frost I'm going for bleed
16281120	16283520	I don't I don't know how to confirm. She's poisoned
16284880	16287680	And poison doesn't last neither just scarlet
16289600	16293600	Okay dodge wait dodge. Oh my god
16295680	16300480	I can't believe it. I'm actually getting good at the attack. Well. No, let's not jinx it now
16301280	16303280	I'm being wise enough to
16305120	16307120	Remember
16308080	16310080	The way the attack
16312480	16314480	Okay, I don't like that one
16316720	16320000	Okay, that's definitely poison I think so I'm doing blood now
16321200	16323200	I'm doing
16325360	16329360	Phase two activated look out for snow globes. That's all

16348560	16350560	I'm going for bleed
16351760	16357600	I don't know. She's gonna swap. I exactly what I thought she was gonna do. Hold on. I need to heal
16357600	16359600	She's gonna attack me
16366080	16368080	Okay, here we go I'm back in the fate I'm back in the fate
16384080	16386080	Who did I do that?
16387680	16389680	How did I do that?
16397440	16400400	Sorry my mouse is the gate trying to stay alive right now
16402640	16404640	Just a singular
16407280	16409280	It's not over until it's over
16417680	16419680	Oh, it's not over until it's over
16423120	16429600	I do not understand how some people can do no hit runs. I my mind jump
16430880	16432880	Fuck
16434880	16438000	Oh, wow, I actually survived that I didn't know I could survive that
16439120	16441120	That's why I was too early anyway
16442160	16445040	Oh my god, I didn't even know how to survive that
16445760	16448960	Um, that was fantastic
16450400	16455920	So but I had a few good dodges in there. Sorry, but like I need a few headhats for those dodges
16456000	16459360	Do you see some of them in there like a dodged a whole sequence?
16461040	16463040	I actually getting good
16463680	16469040	The upgrade works. So now I don't actually perish if I'm full health. I don't perish from the ASMR rifles
16470240	16472240	It's okay every field attempt is a lesson
16475120	16477120	Right. Say it. You've not been in
16477520	16478640	Who are you?
16478640	16480640	Jennifer yourself at once
16480880	16485200	I feel like I've let you in a few times now russian. Takun hasn't been in. I need
16485760	16489520	Bleed wherever he is. His breath did get a chance
16490320	16492880	His bleed away. I think bleed isn't here anymore
16498480	16503760	I can have plenty of arrows. Yeah, I do. I'll have like tons of poison and blood so
16505360	16507360	You did great good girls
16508160	16510160	Okay. Yeah
16510720	16514640	Those dodges are scary, but like when you have confidence
16515360	16520320	That you know, you can dodge it in time then it becomes like quite easy. Are you a bleed build?
16523040	16525360	Uh, that sword looks like a bleed to me
16526720	16530080	I think it'll work. Oh, oh wait. I am I am
16530320	16532320	What
16532640	16537520	What you got more balls. Thank you. Are you ready?
16538880	16542400	Oh, are you going to your inventory? We didn't my beloved
16542960	16547440	No, you need to whimper right. We're all gonna do we're gonna get the whimpering coconut soon
16547440	16553360	I promise you we're getting the whimpering coconut after we do this boss. We're gonna get the whimpering coconut
16553360	16556560	I don't know where it is, but everyone needs to get the whimpering coconut. Where's my
16560960	16568240	So you actually can just outrun that
16569760	16573280	You can outrun that. Oh god, we're all stacking. Sorry. I'm trying to get a different angle
16574640	16579760	In the plain field. Oh wait, that's oh no, I don't want poison build up. Sorry. Let's do poison first
16581040	16583200	Stop moving lady so I can hit you
16584400	16586400	I need to get you poisoned
16591040	16593040	Is
16595120	16603200	Is it like those twins in the original game? Oh, oh, we got poisoned. We got poisoned right. We're doing blood now
16604960	16606960	We're doing bleeding effect
16607840	16611120	If I notice the poison goes off, I will go back to poison
16612080	16616160	I wonder if poison and drop would be like even deadlier combo
16616400	16618400	Oh
16618720	16620720	Possibly
16622560	16625520	I knew that was coming from me had my damn name on it
16628480	16630480	Oh
16632560	16637600	Oh the poison's still like doing tick damage the poison's doing 50 tick damage
16639920	16643600	50 is gonna add up over time real quick holy crap
16644560	16649200	I think it is is this poison last the entire fight
16650800	16658560	If poison and rot together, I might be better put myself into poison and rot and then swap them back to bleed
16661440	16665280	Because it is going down face to face to
16666080	16668080	Oh
16670080	16673840	Shit delay. Yeah, sorry. I messed up a lot of them, but I knew I was doing
16676240	16678240	Another stagger
16682480	16687840	Please no, please no ASMR ice wolves. I'd appreciate it
16691920	16693920	Yeah, I knew it was still coming from me

17646400	17650480	Oh, is it like a magic school again? Like a rail car. Yeah
17651760	17656720	I don't even know what we're going to do against that fire giant. He's terrifying. Oh, we have a map
17657840	17659840	Oh piece candy
17661680	17663680	The map
17671360	17675440	I'm not yawning. I'm not yawning. What do you mean? I was perfectly well rested
17676320	17679200	Although this is wait, did you activate him?
17682560	17684560	He activated him
17687200	17689200	Oh, he's ready to fight
17689440	17691440	I think can we avoid him?
17692240	17694240	Hold me refling. I'm scared
17695120	17700320	Okay, let's just keep running past. How about that? Wait, where did he come from? I'm just running. Bye. Bye. I'm running
17700400	17705200	I don't care. Don't look back. Just keep going refling. Just keep going. Don't turn back. Follow the purple refling
17705360	17708880	Follow the purple light. You can do it. You can do it. We don't need to fight
17710000	17712000	Not that we can't anyway. I suck
17713360	17715360	Oh god, they're everywhere
17716800	17718560	Uh
17718560	17722800	That big fire guys are gonna aggro to us, right? Surely surely he's an aggro dude
17723040	17728000	Surely that big massive guy that I'm totally have no weaponry or armor for
17728480	17731520	Is going to turn around and like spit flame all over. Surely not
17731520	17733520	Oh
17734400	17739280	We don't see the enemies and the enemies don't see us. We keep our eyes close
17740560	17746560	We do not see we do not see we are safe. We are not overrun at all
17746800	17748800	Oh
17759680	17766320	Somewhere a great ruin has broken and so too has a powerful charm
17768640	17771280	What does that mean so
17773120	17775120	What does that mean
17777280	17779280	That charm has broken
17783280	17786320	It's new so there's literally no wiki stuff. Oh
17788240	17790240	Shadow keep
17791440	17793440	And there's a space
17794400	17797520	And you're gonna love oh, there's like a temple of dibella
17799600	17801600	Okay, is our refling here
17802400	17806960	Oh, no, is there no refling here at all? Wow the map goes so much bigger
17808080	17810080	Whoa, there's the tree
17810880	17814880	That looks like a looky look we can go to the bottom right and we can go top left
17815040	17817840	We have kind of discovered the diagonal of this map
17819280	17821280	Is there no
17822640	17828560	You can talk with the npcs at the grace to understand what's happening. Don't go. Are you saying don't go?
17828800	17830800	I
17831280	17833280	Don't know what that means. I mean don't go
17834080	17836080	Should I wait for a refling to come help?
17837280	17840320	Tea bag if that means wait for a refling to come help
17846160	17848640	Please no, don't go wait for another refling
17851120	17853120	Please help
17854240	17857680	Uh, is there any refling at all at this area?
17859040	17863600	Checking in from work. How's it going? We progress
17865120	17869440	We're waiting on another refling to spawn but I think we might have a bit of a problem on our hands
17869760	17874480	Where we're all coming at the same bit. I'm at shadow keep main gate
17875600	17879360	Oh, here we go. Everything's are helping. Is there anyone who's not had a chance to be in?
17880480	17884880	Oh, pineapple. You were the one that was healing me and then it went terribly wrong because you were healing me
17884880	17888080	And I did hardly any damage. We'll give you a shot again

17939280	17946160	It doesn't have to be this way refling you can just use the pearl finger. It doesn't have to be so dramatic
17947440	17949440	You're so dramatic refling
17952480	17953600	Oh
17953600	17955440	Oh, no, this can't be
17955440	17962640	Literally why why you just had to use the pearl finger. Oh, I got some runes for that even though I didn't do anything
17963200	17967520	Infinite rune glitch just get reflings to come in all the same and then commit Senpai
17968640	17974560	Okay, are we ready? Are we steady? I'm not sure you guys seem to be stuck behind the door
17976080	17978080	It's a rhino
17979280	17981280	Okay, big launch
17983520	17990480	Um, I'm trying to analyze the attack pattern. Can I melee him is the question

18039040	18044160	I might have ammo. Hold on. Hold on. I'm very small brain
18052160	18054160	Ah put me down put me down
18058640	18060640	Oh

18078480	18084640	I don't do even I don't even know if we have we can do this
18085600	18087600	I
18088000	18093840	Colossal porcupine. Is that his name half porcupine half rhino half dug
18094640	18097280	It's a porcupine. It's head to Potomac
18099280	18102240	It's not only a hip or a golden missile. Wow
18104880	18106880	Hmm
18108000	18110000	Mm-hmm
18110000	18113840	Um not very confident
18115440	18118240	But you know what sometimes it's okay to say you're not confident
18119040	18121680	Right. No, I'm you didn't get a chance to do that one
18123040	18125040	I did just have you in
18126160	18130640	You guys really are quite far ahead if you're able to help me this far into the dlc
18132000	18135120	You haven't finished is anyone finished the dlc?
18135520	18137120	I
18137120	18140320	Don't know if you set the grace. You can pull more balls out of my storage
18142400	18149360	Because people gave you too many other in store. Actually his name is golden has a lot of potomace, but porcupine otomace is an interesting one
18151360	18155440	I had fun warning strontia that I'm going boss. Are you ready?
18156560	18163440	My lady. My sir. Mmm. My sir. Mmm. Are you ready?
18164080	18167200	Are you stay? I'm gonna wait till like oh, he's dropping me. So
18169360	18171360	Oh
18178960	18182240	Wait, what how is that crossbow better than a plus nine?
18185280	18188400	Huh or is it because it's spread that's why
18190240	18192240	Curious, okay
18194080	18198160	Accusations aren't true. Are you ready? Are you steady?
18201280	18205040	Okay, can I get a free hit and at the start let's find out
18209200	18211200	Instantly
18212400	18218640	Holy crap because he's such a long boy as well. He can go so far
18219440	18221440	I
18222000	18224000	Don't know right. We'll do poison damage first
18226000	18231680	Although he already looks like he's infected. So I see poisoning just to be honest
18232560	18237440	Oh my gosh. I'm not even successfully dodging a single thing from him
18239440	18241440	Oh
18248720	18250720	I don't
18252000	18260320	Oh, that's so beautiful. So that part isn't that was my freaking final column. I'm gonna heal or I'm down and out
18261840	18267200	Okay, we're fine. We're fine. I'm gonna take my wonders for last because she probably actually did something with it
18268400	18270400	I still don't know what it actually does
18273440	18275680	Okay, I don't think you take poison damage
18276640	18278640	I've been whacking them for a bit now
18294400	18298080	I like the warning that he's charging up. I don't like that
18299840	18301840	Oh
18302640	18308240	I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I think we might have it. Oh, I say as the reefling gets chopped to pieces
18311040	18313040	Okay, okay
18314880	18317520	Please help is the closest part I could find
18318800	18320800	This area is torture. Do we need to go by?
18322560	18325040	We got 50 percent on the second attempt
18325120	18327920	I'll see if we can get below 75 percent
18328400	18334080	Then I think we might be on to something who's not had a thrombler. You've not had a shot on this ball
18335200	18338080	About f in time. You've not had a shot on this ball side there
18343040	18345040	Is this what this is
18346320	18351120	Uh, help me so to only if I had a friend of her buddy
18353760	18355760	Friends oh
18356640	18358800	That was so loud for no reason
18360000	18364320	Okay, one managed to make it in hopefully no DC. I guess it was easy
18366160	18369520	Oh, it's about time. I thought it was about f in time
18371200	18373200	Is that my swear word?
18375360	18379200	I didn't know Sam was a swear word. Okay kiss and kiss
18380560	18382320	Are you ready?
18382320	18384320	Are you starting?
18384880	18386880	Adrenaline is pumping
18387840	18389840	Adrenaline is pumping
18391760	18393760	Killing machine
18395520	18398560	Over can you click on to the enemy for once?
18401840	18403840	We just go for bleeds
18404080	18406560	I feel like that man did not get any
18407840	18409280	I'll do bleeds
18409280	18416320	The poison I think he's poisoned in this one because of his he's already got like something going on on his wee back
18422640	18424640	Why is he going for me?
18428800	18430800	Oh
18431760	18433760	I
18438000	18442720	Why are you going for me? I'm literally doing the weakest damage on you. I'm not being funny
18444080	18450640	I literally what a hundred pair of freaking bull relaxed. I'm really not doing that much here. Oh some go crisp
18454240	18457520	Oh that bleeds that was a bleed
18457520	18459520	Okay
18461680	18465600	Less than 50. Uh, I'm ready to just go all in on bleep. Holy crap
18468080	18472640	This is insane. I think everyone just needs to spec bleep
18483840	18486880	Uh, I don't want to fuck up not to be honest
18488080	18490080	I
18492880	18494880	I'm trying
18495840	18500320	If I could get a bleed oh that would be grand
18505440	18507940	Don't get bored refling don't get bored
18508660	18510660	I
18514980	18518580	Need to fill hell because if he does that really fully into me
18525300	18534500	I'm fucking corner I fucking can't get out I can't get out I fast thankfully I'm allowed to get out
18538660	18540660	Oh
18544100	18546100	Too early far too early
18550900	18556580	I'm low. I'm low on fucking heels. I've got one more health. I just need to pop it if he does that really fully into me
18556580	18558580	I'm gone
18568900	18571700	No, I rolled into his freaking gob
18572820	18576260	Okay, we 100% have this look at that. That's less than 10%
18577460	18579300	100% have it
18579300	18582660	I literally needed one more bleed to pop off that would have been a
18583300	18586740	Lesson enemy is immune to bleed like bleed is super
18587300	18591300	Powerful it's what made the black tank wife is that the powerful woman
18592260	18593300	I
18593300	18599220	We can 100% do it. People just these same things over there much of misinformation. Oh about the game

18653860	18656820	Special delivery. What do you need to make?

18668980	18670980	Oh, we got the health as well ready
18674980	18688820	Okay, okay, if you hold your nerve you can actually get over that. It's just a bit nerve-racking seeing the open mouth of your enemy

18956820	18959460	Like if a game is eight hours or less

19398820	19400820	What do you mean you are the vtuber news?
19401780	19408660	I provide the news by just telling everyone like this is actually how it works to operate a vtuber agency behind the scenes
19409220	19411220	omegalo
19411220	19414580	Hey, we love vtuber news. Wow, these ones guys are tiny
19415460	19419620	Oh, they're taking a wallop in and they're poised. They're not actually not getting broken that badly

19423540	19427220	Now behave behave. Hello. Thank you for the redirect
19427780	19436180	I am strony cuttles. Um, I am the hypnotic cuttlefish of vealor and I also cannot stop yapping about any and all plans about vealor
19437060	19441460	Because I am a wee bit of the spring solar just a slight bit of it. But thankfully
19442420	19444260	All my jobs are
19444260	19448580	Getting less and less and I'm just gonna be a full-time streamer that gets to do the fun stuff
19449380	19452580	Um, and I don't have to plan a billion different things
19453300	19459060	I love it. I love losing my job and just getting one job and keeping it. You're the entire news
19461700	19463700	What in one episode
19464740	19469380	I did a veal or exposing stream which was really fun because I think people were like
19470340	19474260	How is it possible? And I got to like be like, um
19475140	19478500	Actually the reason why any of this is even possible
19479380	19481380	Is because uh, there's no
19481540	19488420	Fucking stop from the company. It's self-owned. It's been seated. There's no debt and also, uh, corporate grief bad
19488500	19491300	Like, um, actually like I was so into that line
19491940	19494580	Is this a back short door a shortcut door?
19495460	19498100	To the right. I think this might have been the shortcut door
19499060	19501060	Okay, that way wait
19506900	19508100	Huh?
19508100	19509780	I mean
19509780	19514420	Right, we've unlocked the shortcut. It must just be two different sections. We unlock the shortcut. It's fine. We're fine
19514900	19520260	Strongly going over through capitalism using her agency. Wait, what do you mean that?

19532900	19534500	What if we do that?
19534500	19540500	But then we don't we don't do the bad thing and artificially raise prices so people can actually just exist
19540580	19544580	Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. We can't be saying these things out live. We're gonna get in trouble
19545780	19548180	What if we become the billion dollar company?
19549060	19551060	so we
19551380	19552820	Can
19552820	19557060	You know make sure the world doesn't artificially inflate because it's not real inflation
19557540	19563460	That's the kicker. But anyway enough of the tinfoil hat. We need to we need to be respectful. We're all about the respect

20105940	20108740	How are you supposed to get that item up there? Do you see it?
20111780	20113780	That's impossible
20114900	20123300	You'll get it later. Okay. Are you both healing me up? Okay, right? There's gonna be enemies ahead. Unfortunately. They've all reset, but

20243540	20245540	Okay, let's go
20246820	20249300	Oh, I miss that's okay. You don't have to hit everything
20250580	20255300	You miss 100% of the shots you don't take but it doesn't mean you're gonna hit 100% of the shots you take
20255700	20257700	That's not how probability works. Okay
20258420	20260420	Long as you try your best

21222020	21224020	Oh
21227220	21229220	Yeah
21235300	21236420	Uh
21236420	21240020	Sorry, I zeroed with like are we supposed to play ads here in streams and I'm like, no
21240660	21244340	No, it ruins the viewer. She just doesn't know better, but um
21248580	21253380	And I said no interrupts the viewer experience far too much
21254340	21256340	And
21256420	21261220	We're learning out of here. We're getting better. She was doing leak rage as much
21263940	21271300	And no, and we are not going to play ads during spain some people like, you know, some agencies can I completely get it
21271300	21272660	It helps pay for yourself
21272660	21278340	I would rather value the viewer's experience now some don't get me wrong some folk are like, oh, I'm away for a pee
21278500	21281140	Like I'll go run and add but I feel like it's just too intrusive
21281140	21287300	Like I'd rather you sat and looked at my little snot bubble and my hypnotic hair than sit through like some ads
21287300	21290740	That you couldn't give less of a rat or something like I'm sorry the way the internet is going
21290900	21295700	It's like you can't even access an internet page other than wikipedia
21296020	21299460	Without being advertised to like you can't even search up mothers
21299700	21305700	I want a uh apple pie recipe without getting some fucking essay full of buzzwords to try and get higher up and like
21306020	21308020	So it's on to
21310900	21316180	I'd honestly consider dropping youtube if I couldn't block ads on it. Oh boy. Do I have an update for you?
21316580	21321620	Um, they're actually going to integrate ads into videos if that makes sense
21322180	21325060	So it will not register as an advertisement
21325140	21329700	It will register as a streamed part of the service of youtube when you click on a video
21330180	21333060	I don't know when that's gonna happen, but it has been announced
21333380	21338980	So I don't know what's going to be the result of that nonsense, but uh, yeah
21340900	21346580	I don't know. I don't know how they're going to do it because I
21350340	21356260	Unfortunately, I'm too uneducated and how like legal advertisements work and how
21357540	21359540	and how
21360260	21366100	People should have a right to not have advertisements shoved down their throat every two seconds
21367380	21374340	I don't know enough education about advertisements and all that jazz, but I very strongly feel like as
21375620	21378020	Give me the tinfoil hat before I borrow this cup of tea
21379300	21381300	If you go outside
21381380	21384820	Try and make a note of how many advertisements you see
21385620	21389780	Whether that has been normalized like having a car brand
21390900	21391860	Advertisement
21391860	21399220	You go shopping and you get a bag free advertisement the clothes you wear free advertisement because it's what'll be logo on it
21399780	21402580	like the bombardment of
21403620	21409700	Advertisement you experience when you go outside is batch and say hey look at your come look at your setup
21409700	21411620	Look at your computer right now
21411620	21415460	What do you see you can see the logo of your monitor right now?
21415700	21418820	Look on your keyboard. You can see the logo of your keyboard right now
21418980	21422980	Look at your mouse. You can see the logo of the mouse the heads that everything is like little
21423700	21429060	Little advertisements to just feel useless useless like I'm looking at my 3d. It's got a 3d. I'm looking at my focus right
21429060	21431860	It's got focus right on it. I'm looking at the bottom of the water. It's got like
21432500	21433540	um
21433540	21434740	Now don't get me wrong
21434740	21438580	I understand putting the company name or brand on something
21438980	21442500	But when you start to consider everything as an advertisement
21443460	21445460	Nothing is sacred
21446260	21448260	Nothing is sacred everything
21448740	21455140	Everything has their brand on it. Everything has their logo on it. There's like what who is it?
21455220	21460020	There's someone that just wear like plain white t-shirt knee tag on the back say and
21461300	21464100	But I all have to be done with that. This rant is sponsored by rage
21465700	21467700	I don't know what they pay you
21468420	21471620	I heard raid shadow legends like when streamers stream it
21472260	21474260	I don't know if they pay good for stream
21474500	21477220	Time to make our own flows the reefling way
21478100	21479460	exactly
21479460	21486820	Wait, it's all advertising always hasn't think of how normalized it is though. Imagine what 200 years back
21487380	21489380	the most advertisement you got
21490260	21492100	Have you I've actually got an
21493060	21496260	I've actually got an interest in old glass bottles
21496820	21499220	from like before before like
21499780	21503780	You know the big thing and like they it used to be like this is
21504580	21506660	um produced by
21506660	21513780	This family for this bottle type thing of medicine type thing and it was just fascinating because it wasn't like a faceless corporation
21514100	21519460	It was like no, this is a family lineage like, you know when a company's like, oh, let's celebrate
21519460	21524980	We've been in business for a hundred years. There's no soul to you. All you care about is the stock market
21525140	21531540	All you care about is your ceo getting his pockets fat or else he can get so type thing because of the way the system's set up
21531860	21533860	like it feels like no one
21534180	21535380	no
21535380	21539620	Entity that makes a stupendous amount of money has any soul to it
21540020	21543380	And like you shouldn't have any loyalty to like your workplace either
21543460	21548900	But who benefits when inflation goes up and you're forced to work or else you're homeless type thing who benefits?
21549940	21555460	And who suffers? Hmm. Yeah, again. That's the same. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, right?
21555460	21562260	I'm gonna go make a cup of tea before I put a tinfoil hat on. I'm so sorry. I can't stop as soon as I get started
21562740	21566180	I genuinely can't stop right. I'm gonna make a cup of tea. Oh, I don't need the toilet running
21566500	21569000	I'm just making a cup of tea. I'll be a minute. I'll be a minute
21579460	21581460	You
21609460	21611460	You
21639460	21641460	You
21662020	21664020	Are you squidding me right now
21669460	21671460	You
21686660	21688660	Are you squidding me right now
21699460	21701460	You
21729460	21731460	You
21752820	21754820	Right, I'm not being funny
21755380	21757940	The kettle's still boiling so I can't make my tea yet
21758020	21765300	I'm currently having a fucking one-sided argument talking to myself looking at the kettle pointing my finger at the kettle being like
21766100	21767620	like
21767620	21774020	Because someone was like oh, she's a communist and I'm like actually communism can't work because a fucking greedy bastards in society
21774020	21777540	Always trying to get themselves up. I'm like fucking arguing with myself right now
21778020	21784260	I'm like no communism would work if there was nice members of society that all unanimously had the right thought process
21784340	21787460	It can't fucking work because it's some greedy fucking arse hat at the top
21787700	21789460	Like they can't even bloody help themselves
21789460	21791780	They can't help themselves trying to get a one-up trying to get better
21792100	21798500	So it can't work because there's members in society that do not belong in societies that create such utopian environments
21798500	21802740	Okay, it's not fucking possible. Okay. I'm actually going fucking mental on one, right?
21803140	21806900	So then what's the solution? Oh, strongy, strongy. Oh, you do this complain, but what's the solution?
21807140	21810820	I can't give you a solution. I'm not educated enough to give a solution
21811220	21817380	All I know is that I can point out the problems and make you aware of it to shift society's views
21817540	21824900	Even just slightly even if a few reeflings want to come along and just understand that if you're ever down and out in life
21825060	21829540	It's not your fault. The system is built up against you. I'm fucking raging. I'm
21830820	21835620	Anyway, right. I'm gonna make my cup of tea. I'll be back in a second. Just let you should know I'm having an argument with myself
21840820	21842820	You
21870820	21872820	You
21900820	21902820	You
21930820	21932820	You
21960820	21962820	You
21990820	21992820	You
22005700	22010180	Right, I'm back. I have tea and I have my raisins that opened up the other day because they're probably gonna get me
22010980	22012980	I have water
22013220	22019700	How did I do that? I have water inside my hoodie sleeve when I wash my hands. Oh my god, I'm gonna put the video off so I hold on
22020820	22022820	Oh, it's like freezing cold enough my sleeve
22032260	22038420	I don't know how I managed that. My elbow is no way. I have bruising on my arm. Why do I have bruising on my arm?
22038980	22042180	You can breathe as you see then take two
22044340	22050260	No more hoodie what's left? Oh, it's been put through frozen. I actually haven't even closed it yet
22052980	22057540	Oh, thank you. I poor in times to have to
22058660	22060660	You have to leave it
22060660	22078660	I'm not running anymore. I'm a well-adjusted streamer. I love society. I love how everything
22078660	22085700	works out in the end. Nope, it never does. Until the people rise up. I'm bruising a
22085700	22090940	whole lot. I have bruises on my arm, which I'm not used to. I get bruises on my leg when
22090940	22097940	I ride my bike because I always kick the back pedal off the back of my leg and all over
22097940	22104140	my knees I get bruises and stuff. Oh my controller's going to sleep. Wake up. I'm going to have
22104140	22117940	some reasons. It's my energy for this fight. I'm starting to feel like I love you so much.
22117940	22123640	Obviously. Yeah, do you like the thought of me waiting for a kettle to boil and pointing
22123640	22130340	at it and arguing with it? Like an absolute mad woman? How do you get rug bar in your
22130340	22141140	knees? Do you wear shorts? Yeah? Yes? Okay. I actually started arguing with the kettle
22141140	22150580	whilst I'm pulling the milk out of the fridge. Oh my god. I'm so used to my pedal hitting
22150580	22165380	my shin and all that. I'm doing the same thing. That's what I've always wanted. I love doing
22165380	22179020	abstract arguments in my head. Who dare opposes me? Fuck you. I'll slice you down. A snake
22179020	22187340	man mesmer? I know you're going to win this time. Oh yeah? Sorry, I'm just going to have
22187340	22193980	a few raisins and put it back in the fridge. I'm eating them, but I'm not hungry. I just
22193980	22202820	need a little bit more energy on. Mm-hmm. I thought it was normal to argue with your
22202820	22210740	kickwear. Oh no, reflingers get to me. Wait until you develop your nape personality disorder.
22210740	22231340	I'm going to put you through with him. You're going to run a mill. Oh, also, rain me. I let
22231340	22242940	you out. I'm swinging the door right now. I don't know if you can hear it, but I'm swinging
22242940	22254940	the door to get the fricking meat out of the room. It's just that piece of meat. It's
22254940	22265140	probably, I shouldn't actually hear that horn. How long until we remind you? An hour, 30 minutes?
22265140	22271460	I don't know. 30 minutes just to make sure I still have two cats. Right, who have we
22271460	22277780	gotten the line up to do? We have Ty Lord and we have Ruchin. I am going to shove on
22277780	22289500	my meat fucking crossbow. No, that's going to statically do much, but that ultimate from
22289500	22300540	the crossbow, if he stands still, honestly, might be the way to do it. Honestly. I'm going
22300540	22306700	to give it a try and see if I can rapid-fire ultimate on him. Are you guys ready? Are you
22306740	22313460	ready? Okay, you're moving closer. Edging. We're edging. We're edging. We're going. We're
22313460	22330460	going. He doesn't stand still. Fuck! Wait, what? Why is it not letting me do my ultimate?
22330540	22337420	I don't know. I don't know why it's not letting me do my ultimate. Is he poisoned already? No,
22337420	22349180	he can't be. Is that you guys? Oh my, oh my. Oh my gosh. I'm absolutely spamming trigger.
22349180	22357740	I'm so sorry if you can hear my little controller go off. You have to two-hand it. Wait, what?
22357780	22364020	I just put it away. Hold on. Wait, what am I doing? Sorry, am I having a stroke replant?
22364020	22381260	No. Oh my God. Is that even hit? I mean, it's alright. Does that work? God, that's too
22381260	22402260	easy. Hey, Lee. No. I mean, okay, reflings. Hold the four. Hold the four. Hold. I need
22402260	22409900	to put it back on this one. Yeah, I do. Okay, that's fine. Oh no, no, no, no, no, my refling.
22409900	22416820	Oh no. Oh no. I don't like this.
22432260	22441380	I don't like it. No, mother. Forgive me.
22448740	22450580	Darkness? He's going to darkness?
22462260	22483700	He's going to eat his own. No, okay, sorry. He's doing madness? Flame and madness?
22483700	22492540	I'm getting a bit nervous. I'm getting a bit shaky. I didn't like what I was doing.
22492540	22500500	Is he going to be a basilisk? Soon, tarnished.
22500500	22520580	Wilt thou be taken in the jaws of the abyssal serpent, Shorn of Light?
22531060	22532580	Refling.
22542580	22544580	Oh, I'm on show.
22544660	22560660	Oh, I can't even get a moment to respond.
22568660	22570660	Oh, my dear.
22574660	22586660	Why? Why are we supposed to defeat that?
22588660	22596660	Oh, my dear. Oh, my dear. Why are we supposed to defeat that?
22596740	22609140	I don't. That's the fun part you're doing. I think we're going to have to come back.
22616020	22619860	Oh, hope is lost when the French comes out. Literally the only time I can consistently
22619860	22627060	speak French is to ask why. Why am I forsaken? ASMR's littlest warrior versus a big snake.
22631860	22635140	This is the final boss of the DLC. He's a guy from the cover.
22637620	22647220	Grinding for runes? Are you joking? Grinding for runes? I'm level 210, boosted. And you want me
22647220	22655220	to go looking for weasels? The guy on the cover is never the final boss. There's some optional
22655220	22659300	stuff you can do right now. Oh, this isn't, I was going to say this can't be the final boss.
22659300	22666420	Everyone's like, oh, do you see massive, do you see massive? You need, you don't need runes,
22666420	22671700	you need the fragment. Okay, there is a scorpion rune I ignored because I couldn't spawn you guys
22671700	22679460	in. About two scared. I think I need to bring you back down. Okay, I need to bring you back
22679460	22682900	down these stairs because I missed one back here because I was too scared. But no, that
22682900	22692660	have you guys, I'm not scared anyway. Okay, do the gate before the lion. It's the one at the scorpion.
22693220	22706180	Okay, we're at seven for blessing and then the revered ash blessing. Okay, I need to take you
22706180	22719540	guys down the stairs here. This is just exploration. Okay, and come back briefly. God, you were quick
22719540	22729060	on that. You could also put more smithing stones in a way. I guess because I picked up so many,
22729060	22737460	right? I mean, mate, I feel like the crossbow's the only way that's keeping me alive. Azuridule
22737460	22741540	is most likely streaming live right now. I'm about to go best to look everyone
22741540	22749380	about damn time. Oh, you did amazing. Thank you for all the carries. We things we are at stage
22749380	22760100	front in the DLC. It's to the left stage front in front of the lion. You can't call up here.
22761860	22762980	Why do I hear boss music?
22763860	22772900	You can't summon after the boss back and summon an enemy. How am I supposed to get you guys to help me?
22776100	22781860	Who fucking wrote this book honestly? Right, wait, hold on. Okay, I guess we need to backtrack.
22781860	22785620	Refling, can I ask you to kindly leave pretty please? I'll take your name out because I didn't
22785620	22797140	realize. Thank you. No, no, you can't leave me. There's too many enemies. I need reflings to help me.
22799220	22803940	There's scorpions everywhere. I need to go, I need to go two thingies away and then the
22803940	22812340	refling is leaving. Are you sure? I'll trust your judgment, but if I die, it's up to you.
22814340	22818580	Okay, okay, okay. Thank you. Thank you. I need the reflings to help me through the scorpion pit.
22819540	22829460	Right, so do we, is it this one? The private altar. It may be the private altar.
22830420	22836900	We can go for the scream and coconut as well. Oh yeah, we need to do that. Yes, we'll do that.
22836900	22839780	Okay, I need to get this missing one by the scorpion.
22848020	22855380	Can I not fucking get anyone in? And all the castles doesn't work at all. All pieces. Right,
22855460	22860820	we're doing the coconut then. Where's the coconut? You can only do red tier though,
22860820	22867140	the boss of the Legacy Dungeon is dead. Whoa, that's so silly. I can't believe they saw my
22867140	22872500	gameplay from a year ago and then prevented it from happening again. Yeah, I already tried
22872500	22877460	all that. It's the white wall preventing from coming inside. Don't you dare leave Strone
22877540	22886420	alone. What is the name of the coconut? A pudimmi? No, that's all right.
22888180	22894340	That's me. Coconut is at the very bottom of the map. We're down here. We're here
22895700	22903860	at the fourth church of Mersa, the moaning one. Oh, there's a boss at the Black Gate. It's
22903940	22909940	walking like four or five. Actually, it's a few areas that we can travel. The moaning one is in
22909940	22920980	the DLC map. Wimpering coconut is in DLC map? No. No, this cannot be.
22924660	22932180	Say you're having a giggle. Oh, right. Okay, we're going to go to High Cross and we're going to take
22932180	22937620	a right down to whatever this is because there's something here, okay? So High Cross
22939460	22944980	and then we'll take a right down the path. We'll go north and then right. North and east.
22948820	22956900	Billy, game. Do you talk to me now? No, sorry. Hello. Hi. Did you feel it? But while my devotions
22956900	22963780	are chiming by my trust, I know it. I can wield my sword to call the undeserving,
22964420	22969860	those unfit to bask in tenderness. This is so cult, Prathen. Be careful. I should have thought of this
22969860	22976580	earlier. But me? I'm allowed to be your prophecy. Oh, prophecy. Prophecy.
22978580	22985940	What remedy do you presume us allies even now? Don't make an aspen is newly broken. I must profess
22986980	22993780	the spell mattered little. Uphold his covenant, make an ashell. Then America and vilest our tree,
22993780	23002820	both. And surely I contended I will be. No, I don't think so, bro. I think you're going to be upset.
23005060	23009380	There's only one exit. Okay, thank god I can get you guys in, right? Who's not being in?
23010340	23015940	You were my enemy. Well, I just reset the...
23019380	23024980	Wait, I can't... Oh, I can't be doing it. I'm doing this all in the wrong order,
23024980	23027380	so I can't tell if it's like being the last one that came in or not.
23028820	23031460	Hey, mage. And then you become my enemy, other refling.
23032020	23036180	Make sure you guys can actually connect first.
23037300	23042740	But not connect four in the classic. There's either an ash or fragment at the tip of the lake
23042740	23049220	directly north of the rims along the road. I'll put my ash on your tip.
23050020	23054980	Right. The north of the... like here?
23056580	23060820	At the loop? Or do you mean at this lake? I mean, that's...
23063380	23074500	Who made it in? Mage made it in. Mage Reef made it in. Jess made it in. And so did M.
23074900	23078260	Okay, why does that not...
23079700	23083300	Always get worried if it doesn't lay in automatically. Right, I'm trying to drink the thingy.
23083300	23085140	The road that goes south of your location.
23096020	23099700	I'm not smart enough to swallow your directions. Do you mean something like here?
23099940	23105940	I'm too much of a daft. Bam.
23108420	23113700	Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Right, we're going to go north and then there's going to be a right
23113700	23118100	in the road, okay? Oh, wait. Oh, do you want me to follow you? Do you know what to do?
23119060	23125220	You have a light, so it means I follow you? If you don't, if you have a light on, I follow.
23125220	23129220	If you don't have a light on, I don't follow. Oh, wait. Oh, you also have it.
23130660	23133940	Okay, we're just going to explore in a bit. Oh, let me put my sword on again.
23133940	23136820	We're just going to be exploring because I...
23138980	23143220	I would like to. That's my sense. I'd like to explore. Go to the castle,
23143220	23146420	front side of the grace, and then head south on up to get the coconut.
23147220	23152180	This way is long and arduous. What do you mean? It's about the journey.
23152900	23158420	It's about the journey and how we did it. Where the heck are we going?
23160740	23165780	Never been here before. It's like another settlement. There's a naughty horse.
23167220	23170260	We're just ignoring everything, I think. Oh, there's two naughty horses.
23170260	23180260	Um...
23183700	23188180	Just trying to make sure... Well, I'd say we're going to be out of bounds, but we're not.
23189540	23191540	No such thing as bounds in this game.
23193940	23197540	I think you get... I'm just walking some enemies around the corner. I repeat,
23197540	23201300	I've just walking some enemies around the corner. Oh, dear lord.
23202420	23207700	I'm not going to make it. This fuck is the site. There's some enemies that have been activated.
23207700	23211540	Please look out, Reflings.
23218660	23219860	You don't talk much, do you?
23220180	23233860	Okay, we did it. We're now fucking out.
23238660	23241540	Holy crap. Like, frost magic? That was cool.
23243780	23248180	I can't wait for the next deal seats coming, and then I'll do a full magic spec. I've never done magic before.
23250340	23254740	Uh, who am I following?
23257060	23260660	Okay, light on. I follow. Hold on, let me try and finish my tea when it's warm.
23264500	23268660	No, you can keep going. I've just fought... I'm playing one handed, so you need to protect me. That's the only thing.
23274260	23276020	Pass is going to pass me, because...
23276020	23286580	I see a horse. Have we aggroed him? We have. Okay, you absolutely walloped him with that magic.
23290580	23293460	I can dodge. Don't worry, I can dodge. I'm dodging. I'm dodging.
23298580	23304500	Oh, we had a critical hit. Is it critical hit or critical kill?
23306820	23309140	Okay, where are we heading?
23313220	23313860	Are we healing?
23315940	23320580	You look like a bird. You look like a puppy. Honestly, ready to yank that for Jen too?
23320580	23322820	Like a wings on the arms? I'm here for it.
23326980	23334020	But would she have human hands? Oh, would she have human hands? Or would she have, like...
23334020	23341140	We count. Would she just have, like, the wing end? Because I wonder what she would do.
23341140	23343700	Okay, I'm all healed up. I'm all healed.
23345060	23349620	Harpy, Jen too. I'm open for a fucking harpy. I don't care. I'm so open for a harpy.
23352260	23357620	Like, proper harpy with wings, knee hands. I'm down for it. I'm so down.
23358020	23370420	I don't know if she's gonna be in Jen too. I see. The Jen too concept, like, not concept art,
23371060	23375860	but the concept of their appeal has been created, if that makes sense. You know my little cringe
23375860	23384340	paragraph on the exposing stream where I was like, the paragraph about me was like, I don't
23384340	23389300	understand, like, that's where the rest of the story started from. If it's like, I don't understand
23389300	23394900	guys, sorry, but there, I don't understand guys. If only there was some way to, like,
23394900	23403060	truly know them, like, that cringe bit has been done. And if all the designs come out good, then...
23403620	23415700	Hmm. Then, uh, there's, there's no room at the end for a harp, for, for patting Jen too,
23415700	23421060	for harping. Where are we going this way? I'm late. I'm taking your guys' lead. Do we know where
23421060	23430740	we're going? Are we all confused? If we're just, if we're just going and venturing, I was just gonna
23430740	23436820	follow this path down to wherever this is over here. Uh, so we would need to go like south. Oh no,
23436820	23442980	we've got a torch. We have a torch. Boys, we have our heading. Then landing, then landing. Underground.
23446260	23447860	Fancy underground.
23451780	23456260	Harpy girl, do it. Yeah. No hands, just little wings, I think so.
23457060	23461780	For me, it's a harpy. That'd be dumb.
23464100	23469700	I like how we all agree the torch carrier leads the way. It's like the best way to do it. Just be
23469700	23473460	like, right, whoever gets the torch knows exactly where they're taking me. Whoever doesn't, like,
23473460	23478100	if you don't have one, then we're all just kind of following. I hear a cry.
23478980	23488020	That poor guy. Is he in torture? Oh, well, you put him out of his misery, didn't you?
23491540	23500740	Reefling, no! What did you do? I got a shattered stone talisman. Wait, so we're not to go that way.
23500740	23506180	Reefling, no! Did you just launch yourself off the map?
23510180	23516260	Make the harpy to chop it fly. Um, we've got a new body tape and...
23518020	23519780	Well, I've asked for it.
23524820	23525540	Are you done here?
23530740	23537300	Whoa. Oh. Oh. You went out of bounds so the game didn't let you.
23540180	23540980	All my ankles.
23544980	23550580	Huh? None of us can go down. Oh, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave to get me down.
23551140	23557940	And yeah, there's a new body tape in Gen 2 that you ain't really at.
23558980	23563940	Wait, so, does other refling have to leave as well? I think so.
23568980	23571300	Okay, other refling, sorry, you're gonna have to leave too.
23571460	23573460	Hmm.
23578900	23588820	Sorry, other refling. The game's a bit funny like that. I slipped. Okay, now I can progress.
23588820	23593780	Any problem? Let's see.
23604580	23609540	I feel like human, whatever that is. I'm not touching a dime is not worth it. I need to think.
23611460	23612020	I hear it.
23612020	23621300	I hear something looking. I'm just trying to figure out where to go. Have fun. It's a long way down.
23621300	23623220	Well, I hope you're ready for a freaking marathon.
23626180	23628900	I'm just trying to see if I can find a save station before we go down.
23630740	23632660	Are you squidding me right now? I...
23633780	23638980	Doctor just diagnosed me with a terminal case of strontism. There's no cure,
23638980	23642820	but I was told watching your streams will ease the pain in the meantime.
23643460	23649220	So really, it all works out for me. Thank you, tiny, tiny. Thank you for the tip as well.
23652980	23656980	First off, east, then west.
23665620	23666420	Enemy ahead.
23666660	23668660	Enemy ahead. No enemy ahead.
23677060	23683060	You get appraised. You are good. No enemy ahead. Good. Thank you for telling me.
23683060	23690900	Yeah? You get appraised. Good. What do you say? Yes, good, good, good. Everyone be nice.
23690980	23694100	Good, good, good. Seek behind, so to speak.
23695940	23700340	It's so interesting how cryptic we have to be. Oh, you can raid Torrent here.
23709300	23713620	We have to be quiet. No cure, but why would we want one?
23713620	23724660	I don't need no cure. I should stay a flicker if I can't for sure.
23726340	23726980	Don't you dare.
23727780	23729780	Oh, the good.
23752340	23755860	I am there, so I actually don't want to go there. I want to drop down
23756980	23760500	and run away like mad, and then come back.
23764100	23768980	Okay, I can do this. I can...
23771540	23774020	Yeah, talk about the AI knowing where you are.
23776260	23781140	If you're coming over, poke me. They look really tall as well.
23781140	23790180	Okay. Okay, let's do it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. At least let me go. At least let me go.
23790180	23797460	At least let me go off. It wasn't even off. My Pintas. My Pintas. My Pintas has been jorking.
23798820	23802660	My Pintas is jorking. Oh, please, a safe site.
23803620	23810180	No. No safe site. No safe site. No safe site. Where is the safe site?
23810820	23814980	Oh my god, something's going to bite my ass. She's climbing up this. Oh my god.
23816900	23821300	Moeheart's pumping. I honestly can't play. This is literally a horror game without
23821300	23825620	Refling. I'm sorry. This is like, oh, why don't you play horror games? This is a horror game.
23825620	23830260	Whenever a Refling has to get like, freaking despawned out. Sorry, this is a horror game.
23831060	23839220	I can't do it on my own. I'm too scared. Oh, thank god. That's what I want to see, baby.
23839220	23845380	Bonnie Village. I mean, let's see, look at that Bonnie. It's a bit rundown if you ask me.
23846500	23856820	Poke me. Wait. I can't summon. I can't summon. I genuinely won't let me summon you.
23856820	23863380	Of course, I can't summon here. There must be a fucking boss fight or some fish.
23869620	23875140	There's gonna, there's a lot of death here. You? Is that why there's a lot of death? Because of you?
23875780	23882100	Yeah, you're like an actual NPC. You've been named into- The bridge is a lie. The bridge is a lie.
23882900	23888820	Why is the bridge a lie? Poke me. Okay, this bridge isn't a lie. Get me out here. I'm gone.
23889380	23893620	Then you have to ask me twice. I'm outie. I'm outie 5000 or whatever.
23894580	23900580	Not the clock fluff and the wood of the bridge. Then you have to ask me twice. I'm no hanging
23900580	23905780	a boot. I've got no business around these parts when I've no got my refunds with me. I've got
23905780	23920500	a knee business all. Please tell me. No, I don't want to go back in a cave. Please tell me. Please tell
23920500	23929300	me. Oh, please. Why would it be a cave? Because Torrent can't be in caves. Why would it be a cave?
23929540	23937220	Oh, for goodness' gravy. Oh, I'm sitting the fuck down so Scorpion's gonna come back. Like,
23937220	23945300	are they literally gonna come flying down that entrance? I see. We bam. No. Get away. Get away.
23945300	23950180	Let me sit down. Let me sit down. Let me reset them. Oh, the coconut's in here. Wait, I accidentally
23950180	23954900	came to the coconut cave? Honestly? Yeah.
23962180	23965460	Isn't that one footsteps right here and I keep thinking it's an enemy? Okay,
23965460	23973460	we flings. We're in a cave called Bonnie Goal. If you accidentally stumble upon it,
23973460	23979220	you do it by accidentally being in Bonnie Village and then panicking and going across the bridge.
23979940	23984980	And then go past the two scorpions and you get to go. Oh, the map's getting bigger.
23988500	23990740	Okay, I got one refling to come help me.
23993460	24002580	I put you on the explode. Oh, I heard a new one. Oh, wait, I didn't come. I got set. Oh,
24002580	24007300	no, I didn't come in there. I'm gonna sneeze. Mom, if you're gonna have to ask
24007300	24013380	you to fill, well, fill this. Is that? Wait, I think I'm gonna sneeze.
24037380	24043620	Oh, she can sleep in the garden where she can come in there and listen to me ramble
24043620	24047380	with a magazine. She cries and then she doesn't come in the room. Hold on.
24047380	24075940	Are you lying down? Are we doing the blessing even in the covering?
24077460	24077940	Ah.
24083460	24088260	I need that coconut. Wait, let me do my little ritual. Not the nine and a half second.
24097300	24101700	Got you whimpering. Got you quivering. Oh, did you get the pull back?
24102580	24109940	What? Okay, who's in? Set us in and slump and go in. And then pineapples and add...
24112100	24117540	Is that your, you know, your firework? And then pineapples and adversary.
24119780	24121540	It doesn't really count if you're an adversary.
24125460	24130100	Okay, let's just go exploring though. We're not gonna stop us exploring the world together again.
24130340	24138260	Oh, have I got my light on the hip? I do have my light on the hip. Okay, let's go. What is in here?
24141940	24145460	Danny across will bolt those guys so they like explode.
24149620	24152340	They look like exploders. Are you gonna blow off the map?
24152340	24161380	Holy moley. Whose item?
24164980	24172180	Is it too much whimpering? There's an item up there. Read message. If only I had a horse.
24174580	24179060	So I've just been through it. Well, Gimli's inside. That's all the mouse. I'll let her go
24179060	24186740	back outside again. Come push me to change the line. I spank you. Oh no, I'm sorry I let you
24186740	24192900	get hurt. Oh no, my replaying. Get away, you weirdo. Only I'm allowed to kiss them like that.
24194100	24202980	Sheesh. Open this door. I'll open this door. Oh, I got bolts though. Opening.
24203780	24211940	What? Oh my god, I'm getting freaking grabbed. Oh my god, they did some mad damage.
24216580	24222900	Oh, let me heal. Let me heal. I need to heal up a little bit. I need whimpering all through the cavern.
24223620	24225620	Hmm.
24229860	24231620	Oh, I was gonna say, I can hear that guy whimpering.
24235220	24237140	Here are whimpers. What's down here?
24238820	24240820	Hi!
24241060	24248180	Hey, you guys are taking me this way. I can't do anything about it.
24254900	24261220	I was gonna say, something's gonna drop. It just feels like a drop. Whoa, their health, they're so big.
24263460	24265700	Is there even a point of whack in these guys?
24265860	24278340	Will we just move on? Oh, sorry, replaying. Bruh, these guys are so strong. I need to put
24278340	24289700	bleed damage on my bleed, I think. I can't believe it. I need to level up. My weapons have been
24289700	24291700	proven right.
24296020	24298500	These things are weird looking. What are they called?
24302180	24307860	Will we just move on? This is terrible. Right, move on. This is taking too long. I give up.
24309780	24316100	I give up. They're taking too long. Oh, there's more of them. Right, turn back, turn back. Oh no!
24316980	24328340	Oh my god. Are you gonna make it? Are you alive? Hold on. Don't let them grab you. Whatever you do.
24329540	24335140	We must go back. Oh god, was it this way we came? I can't. I don't know. Oh, there's more. There's more.
24336500	24337940	Watch out, replaying. Watch out.
24338660	24346420	Uh, whoa, whoa, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow. What's this? Is this a boss fight?
24349060	24355700	Oh, we've lost our other two, refling. Hold on, we need them to come. There you are.
24355700	24358740	Oh, there's an item back there. Oh, that was the item.
24360980	24363300	Right, right, we're jumping down the waterfall, I think.
24363460	24374100	Ready, steady, uh, oh wait, am I not to go there? You're blocking me.
24376260	24381620	Is that a no? I don't know if it's no. If you jump down, I'll jump down.
24386020	24388660	All right, you moan one more time. I'm taking that coconut off you.
24389620	24395140	Hey, give me that coconut. I'll be careful of the things from the ceiling, I guess.
24396500	24405220	I don't know. I'm looking around. Okay, there's Alexander, Alexander's cousin.
24406900	24416020	Do we need to? Oh, they break quite easily. Low poise. There's a lot of Alexander's in this room right now.
24419620	24422820	There's a little baby Alexander's too.
24426580	24428820	Take that, you aggressive stinky.
24431220	24437540	Oh, we're just absolutely obliterating them, to be honest. Oh my god, I love when they have
24437540	24445300	little poise so I can just keep planting them. My people. What, the paw? You're a paw? Are you
24445300	24453060	trying to tell me you're a pottery paw? A living jar-tard. He's just really emotional around you.
24453060	24460900	I kind of get it though. Yeah, I kind of feel that. Okay, let me grab this. I lost Ash of War. I know what
24460900	24462420	that does. I don't.
24469060	24479060	Okay. Look in their mind. I see an I am here. I'm, oh, it's those guys. What do they do? Oh,
24479060	24483540	what does he do? Oh, there's a light come. There's a guy over there.
24484260	24491940	Is he, so he doesn't explode? He just runs at you? Oh, like, there he is there in that paw.
24493780	24496900	There's something in it. Well, if he's asleep, we'll leave him.
24500820	24507380	This is a tough day for a pension. It's a jar warrior without his jar.
24508340	24517860	Oh, that's what Alexander looks like on the In-Saint. That is strange. I won't kill him. He's not aggressive.
24521140	24528980	Oh, they torch her dumb in here. Oh, that's not very nice. He's locked up. The jar lord now gets
24528980	24537540	kind of gross. Yeah, there's like an actual human inside it. Wait, is that harvestable? It is.
24547060	24556740	Yeah. Oh, you got spanked as well. Okay. I think Alexander has a handsome, powerful warrior inside
24556740	24565460	him. Hey, strange. I don't get it. Oh, honestly, the lore goes so deep in Elden Ring, but it's like
24565460	24572900	so nice that they made the thing, like, it's just so nice to get involved in such a strange lore.
24572900	24577540	I would say it's probably the strangest lore I can wrap my, like, try to wrap my head around.
24578500	24580500	Dianne?
24583780	24588580	Uh, we'll take the next one. You guys go on with that one.
24591620	24593540	All right, are you ready to read every one?
24595780	24597780	Wait.
24598180	24600180	Uh...
24600180	24602180	Oh.
24612580	24617620	Okay. I was like, oh, we done messed up. We done...
24620260	24624500	I think there's three different types of jars, prisoners, warriors, and like an actual jar.
24626420	24628420	Hello.
24629380	24631380	Mr. Jar?
24636580	24638580	Is it the weight of jumping on it?
24643460	24646260	Huh? You want to jump down on it?
24648660	24650660	Maybe like, we as bones?
24653380	24655380	What?
24656180	24658180	Huh.
24658420	24660420	Let's try that again.
24664900	24671940	Oh, no! Reefling! I'm sorry! Okay, you need to do a big jump on it, uh, Raider Reefling, and then it'll let you on.
24677860	24681140	Oh, god, it goes so high when it does. I can't even see it when it goes that high.
24681940	24683940	I need to like, back off and like, look up.
24684500	24687940	Okay, Raider Reefling. Okay, it's coming back down.
24688900	24693060	Just do like, a big jump on it, and then your weight should carry it down. Oh, you're already on it!
24701140	24702660	Reefling?
24702660	24704660	Invader Reefling, did?
24704820	24706820	Did you mean that, or...
24707380	24709380	it forward jumped me?
24710340	24712900	I wonder if because your instance is an anime.
24714340	24716340	Oh!
24716740	24720500	What would be my version if I had a coconut? What would I make my coconut say?
24721940	24723940	If I could get one in-game?
24724900	24726900	I'd just look ink on me.
24726980	24730020	Ink for me, and everyone's like, what?
24732260	24735220	Wow! I'm beating them up! I'm beating them up!
24740260	24742260	Good, Reefling.
24742500	24744500	Like this?
24745460	24748740	Wait, we were gonna have to do this whole dungeon if we mess this up?
24750500	24755860	It's not exactly a fast dungeon to get back. Oh, there is. Sorry, here is. Okay, we're gonna be using this a lot.
24757300	24759300	Are you ready?
24760100	24762820	Are you steady? Do you need a kiss of courage?
24763380	24768100	Kiss of courage. Kiss of courage, right? I don't know what's behind us. Let's find out.
24768500	24772500	Okay, okay, okay.
24779940	24781940	Huh?
24782100	24784420	My auto lock doesn't auto lock onto the enemy.
24784980	24789700	I'm gonna start swinging. I'm gonna start swinging off in this bitch. I'm gonna start swinging! I'm swinging!
24790660	24792660	I'm doing it!
24793380	24795380	How the fuck can you see them?
24796180	24798180	Oh, I...
24802180	24808180	Am I going crazy or is it just my screen? I'm losing it. What the fuck?
24813140	24818500	Oh, I hit it! I actually got hit! Oh, I'm dead! I'm dead! Hold on. Sorry, I'm getting overzealous.
24826100	24831940	Uh, how are you guys doing this? Are you just guessing? They must be guessing.
24833940	24838020	They go in this... Okay, right. As long as I wasn't absolutely losing it, I was like,
24838020	24841460	how do you guys know where to swing? Because they were just hitting, hitting, hitting, constantly.
24846740	24853940	We did it! We did it! So, is there like any secret for them? Or is this just one of them bosses to do?
24854740	24859300	I remember some sister actually did a series where she kills all the Elden Ring bosses.
24859300	24864660	I'm curious if she'll do the DLC run as well. I don't know if she'll do it anytime soon, but
24866180	24870180	uh, that was the lamest boss, which I can even see her!
24871140	24876660	I'm gonna start swinging my sword around like, I can swing my sword, son! You cannot afford sword!
24877620	24882260	I can't call you the not Bonnie Village.
24882820	24888420	Did I need to kill that red NPC? Or was there something I could do?
24889140	24900180	Right, so that's where I've been. Let's run.
24907300	24911460	I do like how Torrent is so down. He's like, what? You want me to ride this house? Sure.
24912420	24915060	Like Torrent, you're actually like, listen to me so well.
24919540	24927700	Me keeping myself safe from enemies like, right. Oh, well, close enough. And of course they all get
24927700	24934180	activated. Wait, so can I not, is that bridge open for business or not?
24934180	24934900	Oh.
24939060	24946020	There we go. Right, now what? Oh, I'm still not over. Wait, what? Am I just taking a really obtuse
24946020	24951380	way to try and get Kroa? Wait, I was a little too right in there.
24956260	24957460	Oh, it's a dead snip.
24957620	24970580	Sick. There's something here. Oh, mother. Sweet mother, sweet mother, send your child
24970580	24976500	unto me. The sins of being worthy must be cut. I look like the bridge was broken. I might be
24976500	24983380	fucking right. See, the bridge isn't broken and I'm just blind. Why did I think it was broken?
24987540	24998020	I don't know. For some reason I thought the bridge was broken. No, it's not. Wait,
24998980	25004100	I think I might have just like completely had a, I don't know, loss of focus then because I
25004100	25012900	could have sworn this was like both. Silence, my brother. Hello. I can't tell you.
25013860	25022980	For pity's sake, your place is in the jar. Night, sainthood itself awaits you within.
25022980	25028260	For shamans like you, this is your lot, life where you accorded for this alone.
25031460	25034420	The whipping. I can whip my refunds.
25034500	25042260	Which, I'm curious. It's still not a save station. Is that one over there though?
25043540	25050340	Oh, cheeky little summoning. The jar was made for me. You're going in the jar.
25051060	25056580	Oh, my freaking every market stuff is on the way. I'm so excited. I can't wait.
25056580	25059940	I can wait. Safety, yes.
25064100	25067380	Heard her getting the draw refund. Is there anything I can do to level up the line?
25069300	25069620	No.
25072340	25078580	Uh, no. Okay. There is one thing important. Again, I can't summon.
25078580	25088740	I'm not going to fucking make it. I'm not going to make it. Actually, not going to make it unironically.
25090740	25095860	Freaking plain horror game simulator out here. Okay, there's an enemy there. That's fine.
25096500	25100980	Keep her going. Keep her going. Hey, thank you. Great. Selfish.
25101940	25105540	Okay, just follow the road and I will do a natural.
25107540	25113300	Why? Why did it make that noise? What was that noise? Am I going crazier? Did I just hear like a squeal?
25118820	25127700	No, I grew. No, I grew. No, I grew. No, I grew. No, I grew. Get up, Torrin. Get up right now.
25131380	25140500	Torrin, what are you doing? This is just a cliff. This cliff doesn't provide safety, Torrin.
25141700	25150420	Torrin, you lied to me. Torrin, please. No. Oh, well, you know that's good enough.
25150420	25152180	Good enough. Good enough. Get up by hell. Get up by hell.
25153140	25157940	And heal. And get up by hell.
25157940	25166180	Oh, Torrin. Oh, Torrin. Oh, Torrin. Oh, you came and you gave me a ride.
25167460	25179540	Away from the fire demon. Oh, Torrin. Oh, please tell me I can summon you here.
25179620	25185540	My heart can't take much more of this. Okay, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down,
25185540	25189700	sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, not the fire. No, do not heal.
25189700	25196020	Sit down at the fire. I can see them literally in the distance approaching. Everyone reset.
25197860	25207460	Everyone reset. Again, no fucking summon. Okay, if I take a left, I come to this area.
25208420	25215780	Um, sure. If I take a left in this arch, I come to a house. Surely I can spawn the
25215780	25229380	reeflings in a fucking house. Why are you blue? What is wrong with you? Oh, it's gravestones.
25229380	25239860	Okay. Oh, no, those are those guys that do those rapid succession attacks.
25241780	25245300	Oh my god, it's like an actual church.
25246020	25261620	Why did you please for the love of god do not spawn a boss like right now? Please just let me
25261620	25269060	get the grace. Please just let me get the grace. Please. Okay, I don't think anything's attacking me.
25269940	25276580	The church doesn't allow summon again. I'm not going to make it my heart.
25277620	25281940	Literally not going to make it right. So what's so important about this church if there's no enemies
25281940	25286580	here? Is it lower? Please be a lower church. So I don't actually have to think.
25287300	25294340	A resource gathering church?
25299300	25300660	I hear an enemy that's something.
25302900	25310420	Put marker on the black castello. This? No. Oh, this? I'm about to do like a massive underground
25310420	25311460	right turn to this.
25317300	25317940	To the left.
25324340	25327540	I'm not being fucking dumb. This thing down here, you want me to go down?
25332020	25334020	Me listening to the enemy get closer to me.
25336420	25340980	Don't go right. Just go down and take a left and then whatever happens in here happens.
25341540	25343140	I assume just go dead ahead then.
25345780	25347940	No reefing for five minutes and she's Parisian.
25349620	25352660	I can literally hear an enemy stalking this type of thing.
25355620	25357700	I'm just going to go north and let the wind take me.
25361620	25364260	What's patrolling the church is my question.
25364260	25378580	Is it a turtle? Did I get scared by a turtle?
25380580	25383700	Honestly, probably. Dog. Behold the dog.
25395220	25397620	Oh, it's frogs in the water.
25401460	25405460	Oh, something perished. I don't know what, but no problem there.
25407780	25414660	Wow. Is it a downward path and everything? Oh, is it that I'm supposed to take? Like all the
25414660	25417140	way down here and then get up to here? I'm so dumb.
25418740	25420260	I am so dumb.
25421220	25428740	Okay, don't go down there. Okay, just go straight ahead. I go north and let the path take me.
25430340	25431860	Take me path. Take me.
25437700	25439860	Oh, Tarn, you're such a brave boy.
25441540	25443380	You are. You are my noble goat.
25444340	25448420	Turn left once you hit a wall. Hard to hit the wall, I'm afraid.
25451220	25456020	I'm going for it. Like a wall down here? Take a lift.
25463860	25465140	This buddy looks like it.
25470500	25472420	I'm fucking terrified.
25476020	25478020	I'm not going to lie. I'm shitting myself.
25480660	25489860	The fact that I'm actually allowed to raid Torn and then inside. Oh, it's happening.
25492180	25497300	Oh, thank God. Oh, please, please let this be the one.
25498660	25506980	Oh, thank the maker. I can't do that anymore. It's called Church District Entrance.
25507460	25511460	God, I feel like I need to pee myself in fear.
25512820	25517940	Jace, Louise, what are we looking at? I'll show you guys come in.
25519300	25521860	There's crabs on the roof. It's flooded.
25522820	25536660	I hope it's all. Oh, refunds. I've never been happier to see you in a nightmare.
25538100	25543380	The peeler allegations. Literally, I feel like peeing in fear. I cannot handle this game alone.
25543380	25548340	It's too scary. Everything coming at me at once. I can't handle it.
25552580	25560420	Okay, I've got my rival in already.
25562740	25568260	Wait, you got this? Okay, and then any con? I don't know how many reeflings are here.
25568260	25572100	I feel like we're getting caught with the DLC with each other.
25572660	25577140	I gave you a 24-hour head start. I won't hear any allegations. I didn't give you guys help.
25577940	25581620	She says that she has like a billion rinses her name.
25584980	25587380	It's not gonna be scared about except scary monsters.
25587380	25590340	Wait, strongy, join the peeler allegations.
25590340	25592900	No, the ball is in Azur's court.
25594100	25597540	The ball is in Azur's court. I'm actually going to go for a tenkel very quickly.
25597540	25599860	The toilet's right there. I'm literally going to be like a millisecond.
25697140	25713860	Are you squidding me right now?
25727460	25756500	Okay, good news is both babies are still in.
25756500	25761540	The bad news is I'm gonna have to leave the door open because...
25761540	25762900	Are you squidding me right now?
25764100	25768100	I think, oh my god, I tinkled all these kidney stones. It's not looking good for me.
25768100	25769300	Oh no, did someone time out?
25770740	25774420	Anya, what happened? Thank you, Dimsey Dan, and look...
25775380	25779380	Logo Dogo, I assume. Sorry, here's not being in.
25780020	25782500	Alessandro, you've just joined this area. I haven't, yeah.
25783460	25786580	I think Pineapple had two moments ago.
25787140	25789700	How did you guys disconnect? Did I do something wrong?
25791060	25795940	Yeah, I don't know what's gonna happen if they're gonna start screaming when they come in the room,
25795940	25800020	but don't be surprised if you hear some background yelling.
25803060	25805540	The AFG don't know who or just can't keep getting away with it.
25805540	25807780	I feel bad. I feel like I'm still getting exchanged.
25807780	25812100	I'd rather like an exchange of money and being like, ah, I've spent my money on this valuable
25812500	25816980	thing. Like, I get something out of it, and it's just like, oh, I went for a pee and I had to mute.
25816980	25821540	Like, I didn't do anything. What? I guess it was a disconnection.
25824580	25829140	Uh, right, what were the... Right, we've got Torchbearer, which is the good news.
25830900	25833220	Okay, big boy jump.
25837220	25837860	Big boy jump.
25843220	25849380	Riefling. We didn't even get started.
25852740	25853700	Riefling.
25856180	25861140	The amount of time gravity is... It's probably the lag, honestly.
25861140	25863700	Wait, what did I do? Jump off this bit.
25864420	25880580	Wow. Okay, uh, ignore enemies, I guess? Oh, do you need help? Oh, they just, like,
25880580	25883940	asked the load. Okay, it's fine. Wow.
25884100	25889700	Are they gonna explode? I'm pushing boost.
25891460	25895540	Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. What are you doing?
25897620	25901860	I guess I can just ignore them. Right, I'm ignoring them. Don't grab me when I walk past you.
25901860	25909620	Don't make myself clear. If enemies don't get me, they just want to... Oh, God, it's one of these guys.
25910500	25913540	No! Enough!
25917780	25920100	Fuck your poise, you're a shit poise, honestly.
25922820	25924020	As if that hit me.
25932900	25935300	I'll stand here to heal very much, so here, here, here.
25935860	25940500	I like those enemies over there are active on us, and they're like,
25940500	25942500	what do we do, man? I can't reach them.
25944740	25947540	If the cats aren't coming in the room, I'm actually gonna force them to.
25947780	25949780	Okay.
25957780	25961780	Right, you can eat inside by cat the same.
25961780	25963780	Wow.
25963780	25967780	He looks really good, don't you look, you're moving all the way out there.
25967780	25971780	He looks like all the way out there, my odd-eaten.
25972580	25974580	Wow.
25974580	25979700	And if we're again, if you're still in this room and I have no idea not to get up again, you're being
25979700	25988820	perished. Right, gentlemen, we have our heading. Anyone been to the cat combs yet? No.
25991140	25994180	Uh, right, okay, we just run. There's no jump needed here.
25996820	25998820	There.
26002500	26006820	Why did the ground start shaking? We're supposed to make that jump.
26010500	26012580	I was gonna say, are you sure, but...
26016340	26019780	There's an item here. Hey, is that summoning thing?
26022180	26026100	It is. Wait, you guys can summon ahead like this?
26026900	26029620	I thought it had to be a summoning, am I being gummy?
26032660	26037540	I didn't know I did that. I thought it had to be like...
26040020	26042660	Well, I don't know.
26046740	26051220	The trees are shattering in the water. Why? Environmental things?
26057940	26059460	Is there something in the water?
26062660	26065060	Oh, god, am I gonna make it?
26066740	26072660	Oh, okay. I don't know if the leafling can spawn. I don't think you timed out.
26077220	26086660	What is making that noise? Is it just ambience and it just sends a bit? Oh, god. Oh, okay.
26092420	26102100	As long as the boss is in defeat, I can get you guys in. Man, who made the DLC? They literally,
26102100	26104500	whoever made that decision, made the wrong choice.
26111300	26113220	Wait. Oh, no, I can't get you in.
26116420	26117940	There is a symbol right here.
26118500	26127940	No head ahead. I mean, I guess. There is a symbol right here and it's gone.
26132340	26136420	Need you to... You need another summon thing to summon the red...
26136420	26142260	Oh, I keep forgetting that. Sorry. I keep going like, oh, I don't want invaded, so I'll just get
26143220	26146580	the invader in first, but I keep bringing out races, basically.
26148900	26150100	Oh, no.
26156260	26162900	That looks right, right? Okay, that looks right. And then jump.
26164820	26166820	I don't even know how we did that. I'm gonna go on a...
26169140	26172820	A little bit full damage. What are you? Oh, yo, we have crustacean.
26173700	26177220	I like how the crabs don't bother you, really. Yeah, do we want...
26178420	26180500	It's over there. I don't know. There's a door over there.
26185460	26194740	Whoa. Oh, it's one of these bams. Fuck you. Shit poise. Take that. Yeah, you ain't got no poise.
26197220	26200420	Me, when the enemy has absolutely no poise, I can't stand a chance against my
26200980	26202260	two-handed blade.
26204900	26208660	Me, fuck. What was that?
26221300	26224020	Wow. I even had jambon to light the way.
26224020	26230340	Okay. I almost didn't jump. I'm gonna be honest. I got so distracted.
26233540	26234340	I'm helping him.
26242340	26246980	Actually, give me them hefty bones. I think we're going up.
26247300	26253540	Well, not in the water, since we can't swim, apparently.
26254420	26257700	Oh, a lever. Do you want me... Do you want to both go on it, and then I can push it?
26258820	26263300	And then you can see a woman's lifted you. I'm so strong, I can lift you both.
26266260	26268740	You really don't want to go on it? That was a long word.
26268820	26276900	Okay, I had to use all my strength for that one.
26278980	26279700	Causing.
26287460	26291380	A temple rises up from the water? Oh, no, a dream. Sorry, a dream.
26291620	26296980	Okay.
26304900	26314180	Just happened in dark circles one. Kind of a draining
26314180	26324180	This happened in Dark Souls 1, kind of a draining burn in the city.
26324180	26332180	I like when it changes the environment, I have to admit.
26332180	26343180	The astronomical environmental changes are so good.
26343180	26345180	Wow!
26345180	26349180	Okay, so we can get this now?
26349180	26352180	We can go like down there.
26352180	26359180	Ah, it's drained, it's drained, okay.
26359180	26368180	It's gonna be funny if there's like a weight limit to these, and by the time the third reflin hit it, I would break and we're all like, uh...
26368180	26370180	It's charged!
26370180	26373180	Okay, we now have a church.
26373180	26375180	Here, yeah.
26375180	26380180	Yippee! We're safe, we're safe, we did it, we did it!
26380180	26384180	I don't know if anyone has unlocked this place.
26384180	26389180	Oh wait, I can't open up my menu because of the reflin, the radar reflin, hold on.
26389180	26391180	Ah, it really not letting me open up the menu.
26391180	26394180	Dude, I'm trying to show them where we are.
26394180	26396180	On the map.
26396180	26401180	Stop thinking I'm fighting, I'm not.
26401180	26404180	Ah, it won't let me open up the map to tell you what church I'm at.
26404180	26407180	Oh, but there's someone here that made it.
26407180	26410180	Shining!
26410180	26415180	It's because of Jewelfinger.
26415180	26420180	Had to drain a town to fight a boss called the Four Kings, and Dragonsouls won.
26420180	26424180	On it, Dragonsouls, Dark Souls won.
26424180	26429180	Honestly, I wouldn't mind watching like a lore, like someone playing the game.
26429180	26433180	It's definitely one of those games where I can't watch it.
26433180	26435180	Eh, sorry, I can't play it, but I can watch it.
26435180	26438180	Okay, I have two reflings now, so we're good to go again.
26438180	26440180	Where are we going?
26440180	26443180	Where are we going?
26443180	26445180	Let's check another one.
26445180	26449180	Any secrets, like big secrets or items that we've been needing?
26449180	26452180	I'd love to join, but I've got to prepare for work tomorrow.
26452180	26454180	I think this is the last spot I can access to the group.
26454180	26456180	Yes, no one, please don't worry.
26456180	26460180	If you need to rest, if you guys need to catch up on some stuff to do, please.
26460180	26469180	Uh, please do, sorry.
26469180	26482180	Please do your best to look after yourself and make sure you get your business sorted out.
26482180	26486180	Very good to get your business sorted out.
26486180	26492180	I will be streaming this tomorrow again.
26492180	26496180	I don't know how enjoyably we're going to make it.
26496180	26504180	Um, I'm starting to feel alright though, like I didn't feel the sickness I was earlier.
26504180	26507180	Oh, I don't know what the plan is with me.
26507180	26509180	Honestly, I'm falling apart.
26509180	26513180	The scenes and reforms you're just going to have to put me together again.
26513180	26520180	Fire Nate, you know, let's see what it says.
26520180	26526180	Um, what are you?
26526180	26532180	What are you?
26532180	26536180	Raises potency of kicking and stomping.
26536180	26539180	I mean, considering it being shared, that's the one point.
26539180	26541180	Wait, what did I just do?
26541180	26543180	Did I not put?
26543180	26545180	Is it like a, like anything?
26545180	26547180	Sorry, I think it's gone.
26547180	26549180	Sorry, it's called a regression.
26549180	26552180	If you pitch yourself past a safe limit, your body is all, this must be life or death.
26552180	26554180	You start feeling better, but I'm totally damaging your health.
26554180	26555180	Are you sure?
26555180	26557180	I mean, I'm just like fucking, oh no.
26557180	26559180	Does that mean there's a boss fight ahead?
26559180	26563180	Fight ahead if you're giving me a bolt?
26563180	26566180	Thank you very much though.
26566180	26569180	I might feel a little better.
26569180	26572180	We'll put you back together as many times as you need to.
26572180	26576180	We break each other beyond our limits, but we patch each other up after.
26576180	26579180	Oh my God, the medic reach of her?
26579180	26581180	When?
26581180	26583180	I guess in that door is locked down there.
26583180	26586180	Or is it a fake door?
26586180	26589180	Ooh!
26589180	26592180	Battlefield priest cookbook.
26592180	26595180	How many gems do you have?
26595180	26597180	You're going to make a blinding.
26597180	26602180	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
26602180	26605180	Are you giving my mummy a heart attack?
26605180	26609180	This is literally what gave my mum a heart attack age for it.
26609180	26613180	Okay, well, I have incredibly good news about my age.
26613180	26619180	I know V-triple rule is not to reveal your age, but I have fantastic news about my age.
26619180	26625180	Um, and...
26625180	26628180	Yeah, I...
26628180	26630180	Oh no, is everyone on? Is everyone on?
26630180	26633180	Okay, okay, good, huddle up, huddle up, refling.
26633180	26636180	I'm glad we're all close.
26636180	26639180	What happens in the elevator stays in the elevator.
26639180	26642180	Or the lift, you see the lift.
26642180	26644180	She's a hag, it's so over.
26644180	26648180	I am not actually a hag age.
26648180	26652180	Um, I am...
26652180	26654180	I'm not, so...
26654180	26659180	I assume hag age is fairy.
26659180	26661180	When he's thin, she's not over the...
26661180	26664180	I can't believe she's not to that 300,000.
26664180	26668180	I mean, Azura is four...
26668180	26673180	Is Azura four billion years old? I can't remember.
26673180	26677180	Azura is like above four billion years old or something like that.
26678180	26682180	Because I'm a cuttlefish, I'm technically as young as I started,
26682180	26685180	because cuttlefish only lasts two years normally.
26685180	26691180	I don't know what in captivation...
26691180	26695180	Focus me, I don't know what the word is, cuttlefish live to.
26695180	26700180	I have a feeling because you guys look after me,
26700180	26704180	I'll be better than two years than the average cuttlefish.
26704180	26707180	I'll last a bit longer than the average.
26707180	26710180	In captivity, oh that's a word.
26710180	26712180	Iris of Grace?
26712180	26714180	Oh, I like that one.
26714180	26718180	As long as the woman is older than me, I'm okay with that.
26718180	26720180	Yeah, you like older women?
26720180	26722180	Okay, hags are in, got it.
26722180	26724180	I'll keep that in mind for gentle.
26724180	26726180	Hags are in.
26726180	26730180	Ooh, look how the graces were discovering.
26730180	26732180	Marica's rune.
26732180	26736180	Oh my god, one of you guys gave me two of those.
26736180	26738180	Oh no.
26738180	26740180	Oh no, this can't be.
26740180	26742180	This looks like a boss fight.
26742180	26745180	This looks like a boss fight.
26745180	26747180	Getting my kisses out.
26755180	26756180	Oh, they're stuck.
26756180	26759180	I've not activated the cutscene, they're stuck.
26762180	26766180	I don't want to go that far away without them.
26769180	26770180	Is it the heart?
26770180	26772180	It looks like a witch's heart on the tree.
26772180	26774180	Is that what it is?
26774180	26777180	Touch the bloodstain.
26777180	26779180	Oh no, I'm getting scared.
26779180	26782180	Is it the heart, right?
26782180	26784180	It's a plant.
26784180	26789180	It's a plant.
26789180	26792180	I'm stuck on a freaking vine.
26792180	26795180	I saw a deadly sunflower.
26798180	26801180	Oh my god, an Astartian beach over wind.
26801180	26804180	Purely made in my image.
26804180	26806180	Did that do it?
26806180	26809180	Not only did 200...
26809180	26819180	Oh my...
26819180	26822180	Hold on, hold on, pause the tunes, pause the tunes.
26822180	26824180	Pause the fight lads.
26824180	26827180	I've not got my wee cross, so pause it.
26827180	26831180	Alright, I'm holding it, I'm holding it.
26831180	26834180	Okay, he holds in place though.
26834180	26835180	That's the good news.
26835180	26837180	Oh, I did a sick damage.
26837180	26838180	Oh, sick damage.
26838180	26840180	Oh, 29 damage.
26840180	26845180	Oh, I'm really showing him right now.
26845180	26848180	Oh, I'm showing him.
26848180	26850180	I'm showing him right now.
26850180	26852180	Don't you think I'm...
26852180	26854180	I have fire bolts, be honest.
26854180	26855180	Fire?
26855180	26856180	Yeah.
26856180	26859180	Why are you looking at me?
26859180	26862180	Don't look at me.
26862180	26865180	I'm just a little...
26865180	26867180	Wait, was that fire or am I being dumb?
26867180	26870180	Oh no, I've got a crossbow on, not a fricking...
26870180	26873180	How big is the AOE?
26873180	26875180	What is this?
26875180	26876180	What the heck?
26876180	26878180	We're against the Elden Lord again?
26878180	26880180	You're a sunflower, relax.
26880180	26884180	You cannot harness the fricking power of the sun.
26884180	26886180	Oh no, I can't hold it.
26886180	26887180	Oh, fricking sick.
26887180	26889180	Can I do poison damage on a flower?
26889180	26892180	Oh my god, that couldn't have gone any worse.
26892180	26895180	I'm sorry, that couldn't have gone any worse.
26895180	26898180	I couldn't have fucked that up harder if I tried.
26898180	26901180	I'm so sorry.
26901180	26907180	If you hit the head, it does 7 times damage on the sunflower.
26907180	26910180	I thought it was a witch's hat, honestly.
26910180	26912180	It looks like a witch's hat on the tree.
26912180	26914180	Fire and spiral shard.
26914180	26916180	Wait, fire?
26916180	26919180	Do I have a fire crossbow?
26919180	26921180	I have cold.
26921180	26923180	Would cold fuck up a plant?
26923180	26926180	I think cold should absolutely destroy a plant, to be honest.
26926180	26929180	Can plants take blood loss?
26929180	26931180	I think scarlet rot.
26931180	26936180	Scarlet rot and ice would really hurt a plant.
26936180	26941180	Are you guys here?
26941180	26945180	Okay, I see one here.
26945180	26948180	I'm just a fellow.
26948180	26952180	I'm just a girl in the world.
26952180	26955180	But yes, Azur Deli should be live still, question mark.
26955180	26957180	I don't know what I scooby-doo.
26957180	26959180	I told them.
26959180	26962180	I told them I said I'm playing with my refund.
26962180	26963180	Okay, set.
26963180	26966180	Unable to summon cooperator.
26966180	26969180	I didn't even accept.
26969180	26971180	Are we changing order or something?
26971180	26974180	Oh, there's quite a few of you guys at this stage.
26974180	26976180	Holy moly.
26976180	26979180	Thanos and set for the boss?
26979180	26981180	Wait, what boss is this?
26981180	26985180	The sunflower?
26985180	26987180	Who we got with this?
26987180	26989180	We've got...
26989180	26993180	Set and we've got...
26993180	26997180	My brain just blanked there.
26997180	26999180	Who did I just summon in?
26999180	27000180	Oh, Thanos.
27000180	27003180	Okay, that's why my brain blanked.
27003180	27004180	Oh my god.
27004180	27007180	There's no way you're fighting the sunflower Nikki.
27007180	27008180	Hi.
27008180	27011180	Are you actually fighting the sunflower Nikki?
27011180	27014180	I mean, I am not going to judge it as long as you're happy.
27014180	27015180	Okay, Azur is live.
27015180	27016180	There you go.
27016180	27020180	They need a holy moly coconut.
27020180	27023180	Okay, he comes out instantly now.
27026180	27031180	I wasn't even in the playable fucking battle zone.
27034180	27039180	Look at the distance.
27039180	27045180	That is just beyond reasonable.
27050180	27053180	Okay, the head is definitely taking damage though.
27056180	27059180	Okay, I don't know how I dodged that, but I'll take that.
27059180	27064180	Right, I can't dodge this because he's going to do something.
27064180	27068180	Okay, he's dropped target.
27068180	27070180	I'm just going to aim at the head so he's quite slow.
27070180	27073180	He lets me and he's quite exposed.
27073180	27075180	Although he does absolutely...
27075180	27080180	Oh, for fuck's sake, I tried to walk out of that.
27080180	27083180	Why me?
27083180	27085180	You have all the wraithlings on the hut.
27085180	27088180	I mean, it's probably better that he goes for me.
27088180	27090180	I'll just attack from afar.
27090180	27092180	I'll keep it up.
27092180	27094180	No, no, go for the head, the head, the head.
27094180	27096180	I don't miss though.
27096180	27097180	Don't waste...
27097180	27099180	Ah, fuck it, I'm going for the big one.
27103180	27105180	Hold on.
27105180	27107180	Did the mate do his thorns?
27107180	27109180	AoE thorns, possibly?
27109180	27111180	I don't know how he does it.
27111180	27112180	Or how he chooses?
27112180	27115180	Yeah, okay, that is what I don't know.
27115180	27117180	Again, I can't get out in time.
27117180	27119180	Holy crap, the AoE.
27119180	27122180	There's so much distance on it.
27124180	27130180	I'm too busy trying to recover from the fey in order to fucking get his arse.
27132180	27135180	I will say I like that his thorns do bleed damage.
27135180	27137180	I like that detail.
27141180	27143180	Oh, no.
27143180	27146180	Okay, I don't think we're going to struggle too much.
27146180	27149180	I'm not going to waste any more ammo.
27149180	27152180	Take me, Mr. Sunflower, take me.
27152180	27154180	I want to win with my...
27154180	27155180	Oh shit, my souls!
27155180	27157180	Oh shit, my souls!
27157180	27159180	Oh well.
27159180	27161180	You win some, you lose some.
27164180	27167180	I'm too scared to do the boss on that one.
27167180	27168180	I can't handle it.
27168180	27170180	My little heart can't handle it.
27171180	27173180	Okay, let's try that.
27176180	27179180	Time to wake up for your daily milking session.
27180180	27181180	Here we go.
27181180	27183180	We've got Shlumping, you're coming in.
27188180	27190180	And then we've got...
27195180	27197180	Okay, you have to tell me the reason.
27198180	27201180	Whoa, whoa, whoa!
27204180	27207180	Did I pick up anything else?
27207180	27211180	Right, I've not picked up anything that set our head where for what...
27212180	27215180	Other than if I wanted to like lighten myself.
27216180	27217180	Maybe...
27218180	27220180	Yeah, maybe this works.
27221180	27222180	What?
27222180	27224180	Tired of me?
27224180	27225180	Should be asleep right now.
27225180	27226180	What?
27226180	27227180	No, me?
27227180	27228180	No?
27228180	27230180	Okay, my reflings are ready.
27230180	27231180	Let's try it.
27233180	27236180	Can this Sunflower perish us?
27236180	27237180	Okay, no.
27245180	27247180	Bra, he is so...
27248180	27251180	Bra, he is so aggressive.
27252180	27257180	What do you mean this Elden Ring boss is hard and they didn't make him...
27257180	27259180	Oh, sorry, I just punched the mic with my headset.
27259180	27262180	I try to get comfy in my chair and I mess that up.
27268180	27270180	I'm doing a hip registration right now.
27273180	27276180	I'm trying to get frost damage on his head.
27278180	27280180	Okay, I'm actually just...
27280180	27283180	Excuse me, social distancing please.
27284180	27286180	I don't know how I avoided that.
27286180	27287180	Boom, headshot.
27288180	27289180	Boom, headshot.
27292180	27296180	Oh wait, there's a talisman for my crossbow efficiency.
27298180	27301180	Whoa, someone did massive damage.
27301180	27304180	Can you go bleed on a freaking Sunflower?
27304180	27306180	Where is he going for me?
27310180	27312180	Oh my god, you did it!
27314180	27315180	Come on, come on.
27317180	27319180	You did it, you did it, you did it.
27320180	27321180	Yes!
27323180	27325180	You did it, refling, you did it.
27325180	27326180	You did it.
27326180	27327180	You did it.
27327180	27328180	You did it.
27328180	27329180	You did it.
27329180	27330180	You did it.
27330180	27331180	You did it.
27331180	27332180	You did it.
27332180	27334180	You did it, refling, you did it.
27334180	27335180	You did it.
27335180	27337180	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, refling!
27337180	27338180	Refling!
27339180	27340180	You didn't...
27340180	27341180	What?
27341180	27342180	What?
27342180	27343180	What?
27344180	27346180	Does he perish himself?
27346180	27347180	Hello?
27350180	27352180	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
27358180	27359180	Oh my god.
27363180	27365180	Oh my god.
27365180	27368180	None of you told me I wasn't ogre.
27369180	27370180	Oh.
27372180	27374180	Oh, please let me heal.
27374180	27377180	Oh, I don't know if I got the right thing collected.
27377180	27378180	Why would I?
27381180	27382180	Oh.
27389180	27390180	Okay.
27392180	27393180	Okay.
27402180	27404180	I'm hating behind the tree.
27408180	27410180	Oh no, not again.
27411180	27413180	It didn't go for me, so I'll take it.
27413180	27417180	As if you changed aggro last second, you're such a liar.
27418180	27420180	And the duty hit.
27423180	27425180	I'm actually starting to get a bit...
27425180	27427180	Bleed filled up.
27435180	27438180	Oh, you're like looking at me, don't you?
27443180	27445180	I'm trying to take aggro.
27445180	27447180	I know I'm hardly doing any damage,
27447180	27448180	but like the...
27448180	27450180	If I can take aggro, like...
27451180	27454180	Not like that, not like that.
27462180	27464180	What are these?
27465180	27467180	Demons!
27467180	27469180	Absolute demons!
27471180	27473180	Oh no.
27474180	27478180	Heavy attacking him to the head
27478180	27481180	does three times more damage than normal.
27482180	27484180	I need milk three times a day.
27484180	27486180	The absolute contrast with some of this.
27486180	27488180	It's still going.
27488180	27491180	I'm still getting walloped and getting carried the way I like it.
27492180	27495180	If I have fire, I might be better than born arrow.
27495180	27496180	You know that.
27497180	27498180	I'll try fire.
27498180	27499180	Right, who came in?
27499180	27501180	Pineapple, you've not had a shot.
27504180	27507180	Mage, you've not had a shot at this boss either.
27516180	27520180	I like this guy because he's more like a traditional boss
27520180	27523180	compared to all the other bosses who just spam attack.
27523180	27526180	They actually give you a second to think and be like...
27526180	27527180	Oh...
27530180	27531180	Oh!
27531180	27532180	Oh, thank you!
27532180	27534180	Okay, yes, we're trying to fire.
27534180	27537180	I assume burn damages is a fricking weakness considering
27537180	27540180	it's literally a plant that I could put in a pot
27540180	27542180	and put in my window edge, you know?
27543180	27544180	Yeah, fire...
27544180	27546180	Oh, well, I just got fire bolts.
27546180	27547180	Hold on a minute.
27547180	27548180	Wait.
27548180	27549180	One...
27549180	27550180	Two...
27555180	27557180	I'm wondering if I do the ultimate on that.
27558180	27559180	And then just fire bolt.
27561180	27562180	See what happens.
27562180	27563180	See what happens.
27564180	27566180	Boneball, any boners?
27566180	27567180	Oh, sorry, sorry.
27570180	27571180	Black key...
27572180	27573180	Oh, wow!
27573180	27575180	Okay, talk about delivery.
27576180	27577180	I think I'm going to have to send a need.
27577180	27579180	I think I'm going to have to go into my inventory
27579180	27581180	in the lightning thing.
27584180	27585180	Okay.
27585180	27586180	ATR bolt.
27587180	27588180	How many?
27588180	27590180	Are you just giving me everything?
27591180	27593180	To keep bone...
27593180	27594180	bolt.
27594180	27595180	I literally haven't even discovered that yet.
27595180	27597180	You've given me something...
27597180	27599180	that I've not even discovered.
27599180	27601180	Step boneball.
27601180	27602180	Is that a table?
27602180	27604180	Holy shit.
27605180	27606180	Thank you, refling.
27606180	27608180	Okay, I think we'll stop.
27609180	27610180	Are you guys ready?
27611180	27613180	I didn't even know the plant had a second phase.
27613180	27615180	That's what we were going to.
27616180	27617180	Okay.
27618180	27619180	Here goes.
27620180	27622180	Okay, it's going to swipe for me.
27622180	27624180	I need to dodge right away.
27625180	27626180	Dodge.
27626180	27628180	And then another swipe could be for me.
27628180	27631180	Okay, I know I'm learning though
27631180	27633180	that it does go for me twice, which is fine.
27634180	27636180	I'm going to lock onto the head, not the B.
27638180	27639180	The head.
27639180	27640180	The head.
27640180	27641180	The head.
27641180	27642180	The head.
27644180	27645180	Okay, close enough.
27646180	27648180	It's not really beef in the middle.
27651180	27653180	Oh wait, hold on, I'm fucked up.
27663180	27665180	I really fucked up there.
27665180	27666180	Thank you.
27673180	27675180	If I can get his head to look at me again,
27675180	27677180	I can spray it down.
27677180	27678180	What's this?
27694180	27697180	I'm out of mana, so I'll try and do that bonus thing.
27703180	27704180	I don't have an...
27705180	27707180	How are we supposed to be...
27708180	27710180	Oh god, he's going to do that run thing.
27710180	27711180	You need to be careful, okay?
27711180	27712180	Thank you.
27712180	27714180	He's going to come up again.
27715180	27717180	I don't know where.
27718180	27719180	I found where.
27720180	27722180	I don't know who he's going to run at.
27722180	27724180	You, it looks like.
27726180	27727180	He's not having it.
27727180	27728180	He's reaching.
27729180	27732180	Okay, well, I'm too slow to even react to that.
27736180	27739180	Whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't just change enemy.
27746180	27747180	Oh my...
27749180	27751180	Oh, but when I do blood loss on an enemy,
27751180	27753180	it's a tiddly wank.
27758180	27760180	I'm not going to make it.
27760180	27762180	I'm not going to make it.
27765180	27767180	I'm not going to make it.
27772180	27773180	I think we need...
27773180	27775180	I think we need to replant up
27775180	27777180	in order to do the second phase.
27777180	27779180	It's so aggressive.
27779180	27781180	It's so aggressive, I can't keep up.
27783180	27786180	The distance to close as well
27786180	27788180	is just astronomical.
27792180	27794180	I'm missing everything.
27795180	27797180	My first replant is getting annihilated.
27801180	27803180	Hey, look at me, buddy.
27803180	27804180	There we go.
27809180	27811180	Nice change already.
27820180	27822180	I don't know how I missed that first one.
27828180	27829180	Fuck, Nail.
27829180	27832180	Even the planet, like, the sun magic?
27832180	27834180	I don't know.
27835180	27838180	That's right, I'm doing 12 damage.
27838180	27840180	You're welcome.
27840180	27842180	Ah, I haven't got it.
27842180	27846180	That second phase is just crazy.
27846180	27848180	Strony, sorry, boys.
27848180	27850180	I don't suppose we should do the same thing, but...
27850180	27851180	Yeah.
27851180	27854180	I'm going to pull them out of my inventory on the fire
27854180	27856180	because someone said I'm supposed to do that.
27856180	27858180	That is a brutal plan.
27858180	27860180	Baruto.
27860180	27861180	Ran out of stamina.
27861180	27863180	No, don't worry about it.
27863180	27865180	I'm off for the night. Good luck, everyone.
27865180	27867180	And don't forget to drink, Strony.
27867180	27869180	Water?
27871180	27873180	Let me hide you. Hold on.
27873180	27875180	I did get a glass of Cuda.
27875180	27877180	A glass of Cuda.
27880180	27883180	Statistically, I'm going to sleep bloody well tonight.
27885180	27888180	Because exhaustion has to result in a coma at some point.
27888180	27891180	So I might as well just keep fucking going.
27892180	27893180	Oh, sorry.
27893180	27895180	Sorry, my inventory.
27895180	27897180	My inventory.
27897180	27899180	Remember I spell...
27899180	27900180	Sort.
27900180	27902180	Chest.
27902180	27903180	Yes.
27903180	27905180	I would like to...
27905180	27908180	In my chest, I have rune.
27908180	27910180	I need vaults.
27910180	27912180	Can I only have 99 in a category?
27915180	27917180	Um...
27917180	27919180	Okay.
27919180	27921180	Store, know, the moon?
27921180	27923180	How do I access the chest?
27932180	27934180	Switch back. Switch to chest.
27934180	27936180	Why?
27936180	27938180	Take out...
27940180	27942180	It only took a thousand years.
27942180	27944180	Your inventory's full.
27945180	27948180	Like, if I put other shite in it, like this shite...
27952180	27954180	Like you, store.
27954180	27956180	You, store.
27956180	27958180	I can't even use you.
27958180	27960180	Like...
27960180	27962180	What's that?
27962180	27964180	You store all this to kind of use it?
27975180	27977180	Keep the whip.
27977180	27979180	And then go here.
27979180	27981180	And then I'll let me bring it out.
27981180	27982180	Ah, fuck off.
27982180	27984180	Right, whatever.
27985180	27988180	Nah, if you have 99 in both, you can't play any more music.
27988180	27990180	Man, that's it.
27990180	27993180	Rob, all the things this game lets you do, that's where they draw the line.
27993180	27994180	Like, yeah.
27994180	27996180	Say, have you had a shot of it?
27996180	27998180	And you have...
27998180	28001180	Slumping, you had a shot.
28002180	28004180	Just the fella...
28004180	28007180	Hasn't had a shot of the sunflower?
28010180	28012180	Alright, let me write that down.
28014180	28017180	Paying off what you did, have a wee shot.
28017180	28020180	Of net, you had a shot.
28020180	28023180	Can't you ever see if you've not had a shot of them?
28025180	28026180	Okay.
28027180	28029180	Mmm.
28029180	28032180	Netmer's ever seen collection coming to life.
28032180	28033180	Bro, literally.
28033180	28035180	I've never seen Little Shop of Horrors,
28035180	28038180	but apparently it's about a plant that can talk or something.
28038180	28041180	I've been recommended to watch it so many times.
28041180	28044180	They're like, oh, it's the classic, it's the classic.
28044180	28046180	You need to watch Little Shop of Horrors.
28046180	28048180	And I'm like...
28048180	28050180	I'm too tired.
28051180	28053180	Okay, are we ready?
28056180	28058180	Are you ready to carry me?
28058180	28061180	Please stay true to your emotes and carry me.
28061180	28063180	Carry me.
28064180	28066180	Oh wait, is that double-fisting?
28066180	28068180	Hold on, I'm here for it.
28068180	28069180	Hold on.
28069180	28071180	Hold on, I purposely put all my inventory away
28071180	28073180	so I can do this really quickly.
28077180	28079180	Alright, let me get my bow out.
28080180	28083180	I'll do the rapid fire, then I'll just swap
28083180	28085180	to the actual one that's there.
28085180	28087180	Are we ready?
28087180	28089180	I wanna help Mommy out and get a smith,
28089180	28091180	but I'm way too far behind.
28091180	28093180	Bro, I'm literally...
28093180	28095180	The only reason on my head is because
28095180	28097180	Reflins are carrying me.
28097180	28098180	Oh, he changed.
28098180	28100180	Normally he always goes through me.
28100180	28102180	That's the first time he has...
28102180	28104180	The trees are in the way.
28104180	28106180	Okay, let's see.
28106180	28108180	My ultimate, how do I move it?
28110180	28112180	That one, nope, that's just healing.
28116180	28119180	Okay, woo!
28120180	28122180	That happens every time.
28126180	28127180	Ouch.
28127180	28130180	Ouch, I missed both dodges.
28133180	28135180	Uh, I gotta do this again.
28136180	28138180	I keep healing by accident.
28138180	28140180	I'm wasting my heal, sorry.
28141180	28143180	You didn't even...
28143180	28145180	Pull it!
28145180	28147180	Bro, sorry, I'm getting very tired.
28147180	28149180	Oh, I'm so sorry.
28151180	28153180	I'm getting baby brains.
28153180	28155180	I'm getting baby brains.
28155180	28157180	I'm getting so tired.
28157180	28159180	Are you squiddin' me right now?
28163180	28165180	Use manual.
28165180	28167180	Thank you, Apple and Vox for the set.
28167180	28169180	Manual, baby.
28170180	28172180	Uh...
28173180	28176180	Sorry, I'm definitely starting to lag a bit.
28176180	28178180	I'm like, not lag in game.
28178180	28181180	I mean, lag fall asleep, so I do apologize.
28181180	28184180	It's just making you cringe out your boots.
28184180	28188180	Phoenix, you've not had a shot at this boss yet.
28192180	28194180	Maino spelling mistake.
28194180	28196180	You'll be obliterated for such a thing.
28196180	28198180	Brian, I'll let you know.
28199180	28201180	Uh...
28201180	28203180	We had a shot.
28203180	28205180	Who's up next?
28205180	28207180	Come on.
28207180	28209180	If we do it in order of who's come...
28209180	28211180	Who's up here?
28213180	28215180	Oh.
28215180	28217180	Sorry, just our cure off it.
28217180	28219180	I completely forgot we came that way.
28222180	28224180	Your favorite edgy girl.
28224180	28226180	Oh, is that how you...
28226180	28228180	Can I bend over it?
28230180	28232180	Mm.
28233180	28235180	Okay, I'm done.
28237180	28239180	Are we ready?
28239180	28241180	Ready to carry me?
28244180	28247180	Okay, let him lock onto me and break some trees.
28249180	28251180	Oh, the tree stops it?
28251180	28253180	I can't see the other.
28253180	28255180	Whoa, I just missed that no more.
28255180	28257180	Oh, he didn't.
28257180	28260180	It's very hard to see where he's looking,
28260180	28262180	or I'm just dumb.
28262180	28265180	That's a very acceptable answer.
28266180	28268180	Oh, my God.
28268180	28270180	A whole 300 damage?
28270180	28272180	Oh, I'm out.
28275180	28277180	I completely missed that one, but...
28278180	28281180	When he licks at me, it's so scary.
28287180	28290180	Actually, you know what I've just been reminded of?
28290180	28292180	Hold on.
28295180	28297180	Hold on.
28297180	28299180	I'm pretty sure I need to do this.
28300180	28302180	Someone gave me a ranger's talisman.
28302180	28304180	Yeah, okay.
28305180	28307180	That might make a difference over time.
28307180	28309180	You never know.
28311180	28313180	Aw.
28318180	28321180	I mean, they're kind of burning him down.
28325180	28327180	I wish I could take aggro.
28327180	28329180	I don't like that, though.
28331180	28333180	Okay.
28333180	28335180	Okay, he's gonna come back.
28336180	28338180	Don't want to run over.
28338180	28340180	You can't equip at this time.
28340180	28342180	Oh, that would be too...
28342180	28345180	Let's just fucking shove any old arrow on it.
28348180	28350180	What?
28350180	28353180	Why would you come after me?
28353180	28356180	I did the least damage on you.
28356180	28359180	And you've done the most damage on me.
28363180	28365180	I'm way too drunk to play the boss.
28365180	28367180	Are you steaming right now?
28367180	28369180	Try to help me win this game.
28373180	28375180	Oh, what is this?
28375180	28377180	Can you aim for the head?
28381180	28383180	Oh, I can...
28383180	28385180	Oh, I just got out of a ranger no more.
28392180	28395180	I'm trying not to cross over on the path of leaflings
28395180	28398180	in case he does a long arm against me
28398180	28400180	and then I end up hurting the leaflings.
28401180	28404180	Oh, I'm getting really out of range.
28404180	28407180	I don't want to get close either.
28407180	28410180	Holy shit, we're like 50% though.
28413180	28415180	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
28417180	28419180	No.
28420180	28422180	Oh, you're...
28422180	28425180	No, no, no, like this.
28425180	28427180	No, like this.
28428180	28430180	No, like this.
28430180	28432180	No, I just did.
28432180	28435180	I just threw so badly.
28435180	28438180	I just said, oh, we got 50%.
28438180	28440180	I think we can do it.
28440180	28443180	If you guys are able to get 50%,
28443180	28445180	I think you can do it.
28445180	28447180	50% on phase two.
28451180	28455180	I believe, I believe in the leaflings.
28455180	28457180	No way.
28468180	28470180	Didn't expect Elden Ring
28470180	28473180	in the hit video game, Elden Ring.
28473180	28475180	Okay, fan up for income.
28481180	28483180	That was a really good attempt though.
28483180	28486180	I think we'll do...
28486180	28488180	We'll finish this boss.
28488180	28490180	Oh wait, does that not work?
28490180	28492180	We'll finish this boss
28492180	28494180	and then I think I might have to go
28494180	28496180	and try and get a focus boost.
28496180	28499180	So, I'm not going to do...
28499180	28501180	There's just a few in.
28501180	28502180	I'm having them.
28502180	28506180	I mean, there's only one other summon in that I can have.
28507180	28508180	Hmm.
28512180	28513180	We'll defeat this boss
28513180	28517180	and then I think I need to try and get a big focus boost.
28519180	28521180	I can't believe I'm taking HP damage
28521180	28523180	just from existing.
28523180	28525180	It's often.
28525180	28527180	I mean, what HP damage?
28527180	28528180	Are you kidding me?
28528180	28529180	Fucking 5% debuff?
28529180	28530180	Are you kidding me?
28530180	28532180	Okay, good luck kisses.
28532180	28535180	Okay, let's go.
28536180	28538180	Just a brisk 8-hour stream today.
28538180	28542180	Yeah, casual stream, unfortunately.
28542180	28544180	I can't see the others coming in
28544180	28547180	but that tree just blocked them, so...
28547180	28549180	I'll take that.
28549180	28553180	Whoa, someone just cast Spell and worked them.
28553180	28554180	Whoa!
28554180	28557180	What are you casting?
28557180	28559180	Oh shit.
28566180	28567180	Okay.
28577180	28578180	Ipsies.
28578180	28579180	It's a little tired.
28579180	28581180	Ipsies.
28581180	28583180	Ipsy pipsies.
28585180	28587180	This can be the tired.
28588180	28589180	Okay.
28590180	28591180	Okay.
28591180	28592180	Origin.
28592180	28595180	Pretty good considering that was phase one.
28595180	28597180	Eight hours, I'm about to work.
28597180	28598180	You will be on your phone in bed
28598180	28600180	for two more hours, right?
28600180	28602180	I'm literally going to lie down
28602180	28605180	and put Binding of Isaac gameplay on
28605180	28606180	and go to sleep.
28606180	28608180	I'm not very well.
28609180	28610180	I can be...
28610180	28611180	Holy shit!
28611180	28614180	How are you doing that kind of damage?
28615180	28617180	I don't understand.
28620180	28621180	Oh, shit.
28621180	28622180	Ow!
28623180	28625180	It's spanked by a plant.
28628180	28629180	I want to keep my HP high.
28629180	28630180	I do not want to...
28630180	28632180	Thank you, thank you, sorry.
28632180	28634180	I want to keep it high.
28641180	28642180	Brats.
28642180	28644180	See, I didn't want to be in the path of another refling.
28644180	28645180	That's the problem.
28645180	28648180	We might end up accidentally hurting each other.
28648180	28651180	How the fuck is that Madden and Strike doing so much?
28653180	28657180	Oh my god, I'm doing like nothing to help at all.
28657180	28660180	Other than perishing, clearly.
28661180	28662180	Okay, that's fine.
28662180	28663180	I've got heals.
28663180	28665180	I've got plenty.
28665180	28666180	Okay.
28669180	28670180	Is it going to swipe?
28670180	28671180	What's he doing?
28671180	28672180	Is it going to swipe?
28672180	28673180	Okay.
28681180	28682180	Okay.
28685180	28686180	Okay.
28686180	28688180	Okay, I can get shot in.
28688180	28691180	And then he does cut in really big and annoying here.
28691180	28693180	That's exactly what I thought.
28693180	28694180	I've got a blast.
28694180	28695180	It's okay.
28695180	28697180	I'm okay, I'm okay.
28697180	28699180	I don't have blood loss just yet.
28699180	28700180	I've got a heal.
28700180	28702180	I've got one more heal in the tank.
28703180	28704180	One more heal.
28707180	28708180	I'm helping.
28709180	28710180	I'm losing.
28710180	28711180	I'm losing.
28711180	28712180	I'm going to die.
28712180	28713180	I get hit again.
28713180	28714180	I think I'm dead because I've got blood loss.
28715180	28717180	Oh, by a bow here.
28717180	28718180	By a bow here.
28718180	28719180	Oh my god.
28719180	28720180	Refling.
28720180	28722180	I think I need you to kill him like right now.
28723180	28724180	I can't do anything.
28724180	28726180	I'm going to suffer from blood loss.
28727180	28728180	Oh, no.
28728180	28732180	But when the fucking aim is on you, it gets worse.
28733180	28734180	Oh my god, did you do it?
28735180	28736180	You did it.
28737180	28739180	Oh my god, you did it.
28740180	28741180	Fuck me, man.
28742180	28743180	Oh, no, it's dead.
28743180	28744180	Sorry.
28744180	28745180	Sorry.
28745180	28746180	I didn't have any HP remaining.
28746180	28747180	Oh my god, you did it.
28747180	28749180	You've vanquished the beast.
28750180	28752180	Wait, does that mean I have to go offline now?
28754180	28755180	What?
28757180	28758180	Ah!
28763180	28764180	Ah!
28771180	28772080	Um
28772180	28773180	Um
28774180	28775180	Um-um-um.
28775180	28776180	Um.
28776180	28777180	Um-um-um-um-um.
28778180	28779180	Em-imm-imm?
28783180	28783680	Ah.
28786180	28789060	Why is the music so sad for the sauce fight?
28798260	28799060	What's this?
28802020	28806580	Is he- is the music sad because he's killing himself to try and win this fight?
28808420	28809620	Is he getting weaker?
28810180	28812340	I'm shooting his weak fucking face.
28813540	28814100	Now?
28816980	28819540	Embrace the shadow sunflower.
28820980	28823220	What on earth was that?
28825780	28827380	Jeez, I don't know how you did that.
28827380	28829380	Was he getting weaker and weaker?
28830660	28835620	If the music is sad and the school's saying you're either the villain or the boss of fighting for the fight.
28835620	28840660	If the music is sad and the school's saying you're either the villain or the boss of fighting for the long reason.
28840660	28841620	Oh no.
28841620	28843220	Literally, I heard a violin.
28848660	28850500	Oh yeah, totally first try.
28850500	28852580	Yeah, it seems like he got weaker and weaker.
28853140	28856020	Double madness seal for-
28857940	28859460	Oh, tarnished well done.
28859460	28862660	Double madness seal for 50% damage increase.
28863540	28867060	Jeez, that was insane.
28869060	28871540	Oh fuck, I'm actually supposed to- is this just a dead end?
28874900	28875400	What?
28876420	28876920	What?
28878340	28879860	I got a seal though?
28879860	28881380	Thank you for grabbing the aggro.
28882180	28884820	That strat won't work if I didn't go and get it.
28886180	28888500	It's my billions of gold, as I said.
28888500	28890100	No, it's fine, we won!
28891220	28892340	Where's the next boss?
28893220	28893720	Oh yeah.
28894900	28896020	Where's the next one?
28896020	28896740	Where do we go?
28899700	28900900	So I came all the way-
28900900	28903460	So I'm like underneath this section here.
28905540	28909220	Um, I don't think there's anything I can do back here.
28910900	28914420	So I need to sleep a little bit, but take her to Bale.
28916100	28917060	Dragon Mountain?
28918180	28921620	I thought the next boss was actually getting a good night's rest, honestly.
28921620	28922100	Got him.
28922900	28925460	We were going to bed after the boss.
28925460	28927380	How about- how about one more boss?
28928260	28928760	So...
28931780	28935300	I can't progress at the castle because I'm too rubbish.
28936740	28937700	I vote Bale.
28937700	28939300	Bale will humble us.
28939300	28943380	There's two boss- no, there's one boss, the snake boss we're stuck at.
28944740	28946180	But we did the sunflower.
28949300	28949800	Where?
28950120	28950840	Strony!
28950840	28951320	Re-flang!
28951320	28953240	You had 99 cookies, thank you Strony!
28953240	28961240	No, I'm 85, we're doing a two back-to-back endurance runescape stream, just to see if we'll get there.
28962600	28965080	Strony says one more boss, like it's easy peasy-
28965080	28968600	Oh, it's easy peasy because you guys are carrying me through it.
28970520	28971640	How do I get up here?
28971640	28973400	I don't know, I want it.
28973400	28976680	I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
28976680	28977720	How do I get up here?
28977720	28979320	I don't know, I want it.
28980200	28981560	Anyway, maybe this?
28983240	28985160	Hmm, doesn't really look like that though.
28987640	28992520	I think I could probably take a horse and take it down here to this area.
28995720	28996520	We've got this.
28996520	28997400	Right, where am I heading?
28997400	28998360	Someone says Bale.
28999640	29000760	I don't know where Bale is.
29002680	29004520	We're on Cathedral's morning.
29004760	29006520	I don't think I've ever walked the Blue Cove Bale.
29007720	29009480	And I'm stuck in this castle.
29010680	29016840	I did get this here as a divine beast, but I could go up here.
29018440	29019640	That looks like a dead end though.
29021080	29022920	Unless I can go down in the water.
29024200	29026760	Come back down into the water and go up the water.
29028600	29030680	Far so for Bale, far so.
29031240	29038040	I've got grief, like, fleeing.
29039880	29041160	There's a ghost over there.
29042680	29043880	I thought you were going to bed.
29043880	29045080	Oh, I just needed more.
29047400	29050040	Stony, some of these bosses can take hours to go to bed.
29050040	29052840	Well, at least let me know what we're up against tomorrow.
29053640	29054520	I let me know.
29056680	29057720	I just need to know.
29058280	29059720	Right, so what if I take a...
29061000	29063000	I keep going this way.
29063000	29063320	Whoa.
29067480	29067880	La.
29070360	29071640	It's red.
29071640	29073400	I can see enemies down there.
29075800	29077880	Whoa, I see a fire giant too.
29080520	29081000	Whoa.
29083560	29084840	How did we get there?
29084840	29086040	It must be a cavern.
29087320	29090520	Oh, it must be, because that's just the freaking bomb of the map.
29091560	29096200	The morning coconut is by the red flower.
29101560	29103240	Whoa, fuck me.
29103240	29104440	Oh my god, that made me jump.
29106360	29108360	They've left that in as a body dump too.
29108920	29109720	It's working.
29110520	29111640	What is that?
29113960	29115880	Oh my gosh.
29116760	29121240	We've hardly even explored a fraction of this one.
29123240	29124520	Right, scour.
29124520	29125240	Make your noise.
29131480	29132840	Oh, it's a dead dragon.
29132840	29134360	Oh, four dragons.
29136440	29139400	Oh my gosh.
29140280	29142760	I like how the enemies are like spawned in the area
29142760	29144920	and they're just waiting to interact with something.
29145880	29147000	I find that pretty cool.
29152200	29153160	All right.
29154920	29157640	Let's just follow this path and see what happens.
29157640	29159240	I'm not actually sure what happens,
29160040	29162520	but as long as Torrent can carry me through the wind,
29162520	29163160	I'll be okay.
29164040	29166200	She says with her crossbow bolt out.
29168120	29171000	Oh, there's definitely some sort of bridge thing going on over here.
29171000	29171560	Hold on.
29172440	29179720	See if I can get a marker along the way I'll call you guys in.
29180840	29182280	You can explore and foot in.
29183080	29185080	There's safety in numbers, I assure you.
29186600	29188680	Right, so I discovered that church,
29188680	29189880	but I didn't go right.
29191800	29193160	If there even is a right.
29195720	29197240	Very plausible and going the wrong way.
29199240	29200920	But that's never stopped me before.
29200920	29202200	Wait, is there a fire giant there?
29204360	29206040	No, but there's some sort of settlement.
29207880	29210680	If I was a settlement on the cliff edge.
29212920	29214920	Oh, whoa.
29214920	29215240	Okay.
29215960	29217480	I'm definitely not down there.
29218600	29219400	Huh.
29219400	29223560	Oh, I mean that is the bridge though.
29223560	29224120	Is this it?
29224840	29225640	I don't want to lose.
29231080	29234040	To get down there, you need to head south east along the path.
29245720	29247480	I don't think I've unlocked it then.
29249880	29251880	Really go down into this watery bit.
29253080	29254600	How would I get down there?
29255480	29258840	I'm possibly, it looks like there's a,
29259720	29261080	yeah, there's a road here.
29262440	29263720	How do I get there?
29265720	29269320	If I take a right, it looks like I,
29269320	29271560	if I take a right and stick to the left or the right,
29271560	29272920	then I think it'll be fine.
29275800	29276760	There's dragons in.
29277320	29278680	Wait, let's see how wrong I am.
29278680	29279160	Hold on.
29279880	29284120	If I take, if I go this way,
29284120	29286120	follow the path but hug the left.
29287800	29288360	Let's see.
29289320	29291800	If I get horribly wrong, at least we can have a giggle.
29293800	29296760	I'm already, wait, this path?
29297960	29301080	Okay, that path apparently leads me somewhere.
29305560	29306840	They're interested in fighting.
29307400	29310840	You growl at someone else, you bunch of furries.
29316840	29318280	No way you almost hit that.
29321400	29323160	If I hug the left or the right.
29325320	29327960	Oh, oh, oh, five head.
29329640	29332520	I'm so smart, you could call me a cartographer.
29332520	29336040	We did it, we did it.
29336040	29337800	Okay, this is where we're supposed to go.
29344840	29346040	That's it, that's it.
29346040	29346840	Dangerously.
29347480	29348840	Okay, to the vats, to the vats.
29350520	29353000	Careful, buddies, and then you hurt yourself.
29354680	29356440	Don't aggro them too much now.
29358680	29361400	Uh, yeah, okay, I see it, I see it.
29362360	29365880	Gentle, gentle.
29368520	29371720	There, there's a big old cross station down there,
29371720	29372520	but that's the thing.
29374120	29374920	Gentle.
29376840	29378280	Yeah, so gentle.
29379560	29381160	We're all friends here.
29382920	29383720	Okay, so.
29385720	29387160	See, is that cavern?
29388120	29389880	There used to be some sort of cavern.
29391880	29398120	But if I go up here, there might be a rest spot.
29399080	29401880	Whoa, whoa, careful, baby, don't get poisoned.
29407160	29408520	Wow, I see them.
29408520	29410680	Wow, this is Poison Avenue.
29410680	29411320	Oh, dear.
29411880	29412920	Torrent, can you claim this?
29413640	29414920	Torrent, claim this cliff right now.
29414920	29416520	Oh, God, Torrent, you're so smart.
29417320	29418280	You're like a wreathling.
29420120	29425880	Okay, I don't see any implication of a safe site.
29427000	29428600	And that's how something is there.
29433640	29434140	Huh.
29438040	29440280	Ah, wait, if I keep going this way,
29440280	29442280	there'll be something ahead.
29442280	29444520	Just need to try and avoid the poison.
29445160	29447640	But there also is, like, there's something over here.
29451240	29452520	But not a safe site?
29455960	29456920	Maybe a cavern?
29460840	29463240	Okay, well, yes, we're just looking for one safe site.
29465240	29468600	Uh, I think that's a path up.
29471880	29473640	Torrent is immune to poison?
29474360	29474860	Oh.
29476680	29478680	Torrent, your shoes are green.
29480440	29481320	Wait, what?
29481320	29481800	Am I just-
29483240	29484840	Oh, I'm just freaking going backwards.
29484840	29486280	Right, sorry, pardon me, excuse me.
29486840	29489160	It looks like there's more than one way to get to this area.
29490040	29491080	My apologies.
29491080	29495080	But it's per hoops are green for a baby.
29495080	29496600	I didn't mean to paint them green.
29498440	29499240	Can you paint?
29499240	29502120	You must be able, yeah, because horses, shoes,
29502760	29504600	horses' nails are, like, the same thing.
29505480	29507720	So in theory, you can give a horse a pedicure,
29507720	29509640	which is hilarious if you think about it.
29517640	29520440	Oh, they must do it for sure, horses, actually.
29521400	29522840	There's a wind current.
29525560	29526680	I want to go up.
29527080	29531080	Uh, I am...
29532440	29534440	I can almost come back down a wind current.
29534440	29536680	Wait, it's not a wind current?
29538920	29540120	Am I being vagus?
29540120	29540920	It's not a wind current.
29542120	29544520	Why are you- I have no idea.
29544520	29545020	Okay.
29548520	29550360	You just have to care for me.
29550520	29556520	Because we have adapted the animals for our knee.
29556520	29559080	Yeah, so now they require special care.
29561080	29562520	Thousand of dread.
29562520	29563640	That sounds pretty cool.
29563640	29564280	Not gonna lie.
29571400	29571880	Then...
29573160	29574920	Raise this potency of magma.
29576680	29578200	Magma is dread, please.
29578200	29578680	Oh, hello.
29579320	29580040	Is this your house?
29581000	29585320	Bubble, thank you for coming, a member.
29586600	29588600	Enjoy this, me, the memory page.
29590680	29592840	Old Baal, Tyrant Drake.
29593720	29595240	Uh, it's a dragon.
29596840	29599960	Is your fury still yet to crest its zenith?
29600680	29602520	Hurry, hurry, and lay it all to waste.
29602520	29605160	Lay waste to the proud, the conceited,
29605160	29607640	each every last one of that arrogant law.
29608600	29616600	Huh, no, this is definitely a dead end crossing, right?
29623480	29624680	So how do we keep that?
29629560	29630760	Thank you for coming, a member.
29630760	29631240	Bubbles!
29633320	29634200	Are there any bubbles?
29635160	29635800	Who are you?
29636760	29639000	I didn't expect his tongue.
29640360	29641560	Try attacking.
29642680	29645160	I mean, yes.
29649400	29649880	Where y'all?
29655480	29657960	Oh, somewhere.
29659640	29660440	Oh, wait, sorry.
29662120	29663960	I don't think any of you are gonna be here by...
29663960	29665400	Wait, there's nothing here.
29666760	29669000	Okay, there's nothing here but we mushroom.
29670440	29671240	That's fine.
29671240	29673640	And then we take the skywind up.
29675160	29676520	Legend of Zelda style.
29678280	29680040	And then we go upsy-pupsy.
29683160	29685080	And then we go upsy-pupsy.
29687560	29688360	Whoa!
29690200	29693000	Tyrant, Tyrant, don't you get a little,
29693000	29695160	like, feel a little sick doing that?
29695240	29698200	No? No, that doesn't faze you at all.
29704920	29706200	Feel like anything special?
29706200	29706600	No.
29707480	29708440	Upsy-pupsy!
29710360	29711800	Jeez, Lois!
29718840	29720040	I'm in a castle.
29721640	29722680	I'm in a castle.
29723320	29724440	Oh, wait, is anyone here?
29725720	29726280	No.
29727480	29731160	We have unlocked a fort of Reprimands.
29732360	29733720	That's where you go when you misbehave.
29733720	29735720	You go into Shibi's fort of Reprimands.
29736440	29737720	Hydration check.
29737720	29738280	I'm a...
29739160	29741720	Tyrant just jumping entire mountains like it's nothing.
29742760	29743240	Mmm.
29748920	29749240	Okay.
29751560	29752920	We're in fort Reprimand
29752920	29757240	and the teleportation is called behind the fort of Reprimands.
29757240	29759640	I'm allowed to call you guys in because I've not defeated it.
29761000	29762840	My face turned out one leafling is here.
29762840	29763240	Um...
29764440	29766200	Oh, I just burped out of nervousness.
29766200	29766840	Um...
29766840	29767640	Oh, wait, it's because...
29768360	29769320	No, it's that because...
29770360	29771320	So it should show up.
29773160	29774600	Wait, Beel's not in the fort.
29774600	29775640	Oh, am I going the wrong way?
29776760	29778600	Well, we did bit of exploring that we did today.
29780760	29781960	We'll be there, give us a second.
29782040	29783480	Give us a second, let us show up.
29783480	29784760	Okay, there we go, there we go, there we go.
29785240	29786360	Uh, right, I've got...
29787800	29790680	I think we're all limited to have any reefing to come in.
29791480	29792840	Is there any enemy reefing?
29793560	29794520	I've got enemies.
29794520	29795960	Got a lot of enemies.
29795960	29796760	Got enemies.
29796760	29797880	Yeah, a lot of enemies.
29799880	29801560	I've been main being mummies.
29801560	29804760	And mummies for a reprimandation, honestly.
29806200	29808680	I think it's just called a panini press, to be honest.
29810280	29811720	The fort is cool, yeah.
29811720	29814920	Maybe we'll do the fort, and then I'll see if we want to keep going or not.
29815560	29816920	I'll gauge interest.
29816920	29818520	I've got an enemy reefing.
29818520	29819400	I've got enemies.
29823400	29824600	Okay, let's hope you get it again.
29824600	29826760	Okay, we've got one reefling.
29826760	29828840	We've got two reefling.
29828840	29830360	And for the third reefling.
29830920	29832120	Behold!
29832120	29833800	The third reefling!
29833800	29835080	Right now, spawn in...
29835080	29835560	Right now.
29836520	29838280	Spawning right before me.
29843160	29845400	Rise, ye reefling!
29845400	29846040	Rise!
29847080	29848120	Are you whimpering?
29849880	29850760	Goat, goat, goat, goat.
29852360	29853160	Goat, goat, goat.
29853160	29854520	When she keeps talking.
29857800	29859640	Okay, let's see what we're dealing with.
29861560	29863000	One's whimpering, one's got...
29863000	29864520	You are beautiful.
29864520	29865880	We do need to get all the coconuts.
29865880	29867080	We can all talk to each other.
29875400	29876600	You are beautiful.
29881000	29882120	Wah!
29882120	29883560	Some bell stone.
29885240	29887240	No, just no more sinking stone.
29887800	29889720	I still need to see some bell stone.
29894520	29896120	I like how the coconut's done so evil.
29896120	29896600	But he's like...
29898120	29898440	Eh?
29900680	29901320	Eh?
29901320	29902440	That reefling needs help?
29903160	29903400	Oh.
29905320	29908920	Can anyone catch some sort of distance thing from here?
29912440	29912760	Woah!
29914840	29915560	Yeah, yeah.
29917880	29919720	Oh, he's making it rain lightning.
29920440	29921640	He is raging.
29921640	29922680	Is that a giant?
29925160	29926600	We're in the middle of a fight.
29928680	29929880	He is raging.
29929880	29930600	Is he okay?
29931960	29932680	He's...
29932680	29933160	Woah!
29933160	29933640	Careful!
29935080	29936280	Oh, now we need to jump him!
29936280	29937080	Jump him!
29937080	29938040	Make him regret it!
29938040	29938920	Make him regret it!
29939480	29940680	Okay, we're good.
29940680	29941160	We're good.
29943080	29944200	We jumped him.
29944200	29945400	A broken room.
29947080	29948520	Okay, we managed to jump him.
29950120	29950680	Reeflings.
29952120	29953160	Spit rows that man.
29955480	29956520	Oh, he didn't touch me.
29957800	29958760	I have touched...
29959560	29960840	I have touched you, okay.
29962680	29965240	Flirting with straw and he's biting enemies right next to you.
29966360	29966920	What were you?
29966920	29967880	You see?
29967880	29968840	I go the wrong way.
29973560	29975480	You guys have only had access to this...
29979320	29980680	What's going on in there?
29982520	29983400	Oh, there's a knight!
29983400	29984040	There's a knight!
29984040	29984440	Careful!
29984440	29985080	There's a knight!
29985080	29985560	There's a knight!
29987000	29987240	He's...
29988040	29988440	Stop!
29988440	29989560	I'm whimpering too!
29989560	29990360	I'm scared!
29991640	29992520	Oh my god.
29992520	29993640	Woah!
29993640	29994760	Oh my god, he's got a jewel!
29994760	29995800	It's a freaking...
29995800	29996360	What's it?
29996360	29997480	Darth Maul?
29997480	29999720	When he has two sides of his lightsaber?
30002040	30002920	Oh my god!
30004760	30005640	Fuck him up!
30006520	30008280	Don't let him breathe!
30008280	30009720	He has terrible points!
30010520	30011720	He should be ashamed!
30013480	30016440	Call yourself a knight and you can't handle three on one?
30016440	30017080	What do you mean?
30017080	30018280	It's not fair!
30018280	30020040	I will not listen to your pleas!
30020040	30021640	I will not listen to your ignorance!
30024520	30025080	Oh shh!
30026520	30027560	He's a phoenix!
30028280	30030920	You little stinker team!
30030920	30031960	Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!
30031960	30033240	Hold on, mummy needs to heal.
30034120	30035480	And rest her stamina.
30036840	30037480	Okay, there we go.
30038440	30039800	Black knight, yeah.
30040840	30041400	What's it?
30041400	30041960	Edridge?
30043480	30044120	Jumping.
30045640	30046360	Enemy fell.
30046360	30048200	You guys aren't going to despawn through his enemy.
30048200	30049720	It wasn't a god, it was enemy.
30051160	30052440	Please tell me you guys don't despair.
30053640	30054680	Please tell me you don't despair.
30054680	30055240	No!
30055240	30055880	Wait, I'm going back.
30055880	30057000	Sorry, sorry, sorry, don't care.
30057000	30057640	Don't care.
30057640	30058680	I actually don't care, I'm going back.
30060360	30061800	Oh my god, streamers too scared to play games?
30061800	30062040	Yeah?
30062760	30063560	What happens next?
30064520	30066760	What happens next if streamers too scared to play games?
30068520	30069560	That was the boss.
30071320	30072200	In this castle?
30074360	30075720	Wait, so I can't...
30076840	30079160	More like, black and bruised knight?
30079160	30079720	Am I right?
30085080	30086520	So what was my reward?
30088440	30089960	Oh, other than failing an enemy.
30098600	30100040	No, my ears can hear that.
30100040	30101720	No, sorry, I have hearing.
30101720	30102120	I'm not.
30103080	30103880	I ain't doing it.
30104600	30106600	I don't care what's up there, it ain't that important.
30107720	30109000	There's a chest up that ladder,
30109000	30110760	there's also something creeping around up there.
30110760	30111480	I'm not risking it.
30113880	30115960	I can feel my soul leaving my body.
30115960	30117160	What, because I have bad?
30117160	30118600	Go back to the castle front.
30120520	30121400	Castle front.
30126280	30127160	Castle front.
30129960	30131160	I've got a shadow key.
30133000	30135320	I don't have a castle for fun.
30135320	30136440	Am I being perfectly good?
30136440	30138200	The grace castle front.
30138200	30139720	The grace castle front.
30143800	30145080	Castle front.
30145080	30146280	Ming deep further.
30146280	30147640	Is this the castle front?
30150040	30151240	Castle you fought really?
30151240	30152120	That doesn't help me.
30152120	30153480	You need a name to say.
30153480	30154200	That doesn't help me.
30154200	30154840	I'm useless though.
30154840	30155320	I don't know.
30157480	30159960	That was the lion, so it's not this one.
30160520	30162680	Oh, got it.
30164120	30165160	I got it.
30165160	30165720	Sorry.
30165720	30166840	Take me a second there.
30168760	30169800	I'm bad, okay?
30169800	30171880	I'm tired, I'm tired.
30173080	30173960	I'm tired, baby.
30181080	30183240	You guys better be coming in and saving me.
30183240	30184680	Oh, sorry, sorry.
30185800	30187160	Go back side to sit down there.
30187960	30189960	In come.
30191640	30193160	Save me from the enemies, I guess.
30194520	30195960	There's an enemy, isn't it?
30195960	30197560	I can hear something like through the wind.
30200280	30202600	Faultfish in the bad direction, honestly.
30204200	30205000	Waman moment.
30206760	30208200	Good luck everybody else.
30208200	30209000	I'm turning left.
30210920	30212840	Well, there's a few more reeflings in this section.
30212840	30214360	Who's not had a shot to clean a bit?
30215320	30217400	Uh, Alessandro...
30217400	30219000	Oh, crap, you've not had a shot, has it?
30220200	30220760	And then...
30223000	30227160	I want to find Pineapple and...
30227160	30229400	I think Shalamping was last, and then Pineapple, your next.
30231560	30233000	It's cute when you get lost.
30234040	30234840	Not frustrating.
30240120	30241320	The rituals, okay?
30241320	30243320	Even though it's exploration, so I guess
30244040	30245160	it's not much.
30245160	30247400	As soon as you come in, hand me your best shot, boom.
30250520	30253000	Hand me your best shot, as soon as you come in, boom.
30254440	30255000	I kneel.
30256120	30256600	I kneel.
30256600	30257960	Allow me to carry you.
30257960	30259960	Yes, I give you permission to carry me.
30260680	30261960	Okay, where the heck are we going?
30264360	30265480	Do I stop that whimpering?
30265480	30266520	Right, we're to go west.
30268040	30269880	Ooh, I see it now.
30269880	30273080	I see it, I see it, I see it, I see it.
30273080	30274280	This map is getting big.
30275880	30276920	Okay, we have a light.
30276920	30277880	Follow the beacon!
30289640	30290840	I thought we had to go west.
30292360	30293240	I meant south east.
30293240	30293800	Ah!
30293800	30295240	South was the jargon.
30296280	30298440	Just run past any enemy.
30298440	30300120	Got a lot of enemies.
30300120	30301080	Got enemies.
30301720	30303400	They well fistrode at you.
30305000	30307080	But I just ignore them.
30309480	30310920	Move it ahead for me, even more.
30311960	30313480	Okay, keep a move on, Reefland.
30315160	30316200	They're jumping us!
30323160	30323560	Ah!
30326840	30327720	Oh, man, it's coming.
30329480	30330280	Oh, flowers.
30331720	30332520	Are you guys okay?
30332520	30333640	Yes, how much you guys are okay?
30334920	30340360	I need to get those glowstones that do something.
30342520	30343240	Are they scared?
30345400	30346440	Is it gonna run away?
30349560	30350360	I'm so fine.
30352440	30353880	Take her to the priest there.
30355400	30358040	I just want to know who the next thing...
30358040	30358360	Whoa!
30359320	30360680	Something's after me.
30360680	30361720	I'm not looking behind.
30361720	30363080	I've got enough stamina to keep going.
30364360	30364680	Oh, wait.
30364680	30366040	One of the Reeflings are half health.
30366040	30367560	Wait, I think the Reeflings are getting jumped.
30372280	30374520	Both the Reeflings are getting jumped like holy hell.
30375480	30376440	I think maybe...
30376440	30377960	I think maybe we should have teamed up.
30379480	30380120	And four.
30380120	30381320	Are you guys gonna make it?
30381320	30381880	I'm scared.
30383960	30384360	I don't know.
30384360	30385480	Okay, we've got one healed up.
30385480	30388920	Are you guys...
30388920	30390120	Are you not able to run past?
30391880	30394360	There's an enemy to your right coming up.
30396440	30397080	To your right.
30397080	30398280	Just run past if you can.
30401720	30402840	Wait, the worms are...
30402840	30403800	Have health bars?
30403800	30404840	Oh, don't hurt the worms.
30404840	30405320	They're cute.
30410040	30410360	Ah!
30411000	30411960	I hear you healing.
30415480	30417480	Ah!
30417480	30419480	Ah!
30419480	30421480	Ah!
30421480	30423480	Ah!
30423480	30425480	Ah!
30425480	30427480	Ah!
30427480	30429480	Ah!
30429480	30431480	Pain.
30431480	30433480	Pain.
30433480	30435480	My arms.
30435480	30437480	My legs.
30437480	30439480	Each light a bloody ruin.
30441480	30443480	Bail!
30443480	30445480	Bail Bail.
30445480	30449480	Oh, terror incarnate.
30449480	30453480	There is life in me yet.
30453480	30457480	I will soon feast upon your heart.
30457480	30459480	Mark my words.
30459480	30463480	You too shall know fear.
30463480	30467480	Ah!
30473480	30477480	Oh, the pain.
30481480	30483480	The exquisite pain.
30489480	30491480	Okay, we're in dialysis.
30491480	30493480	That, I was like,
30493480	30495480	I'm pretty sure it's not that kind of game,
30495480	30497480	but that's how I want you guys to win for him.
30499480	30501480	That's what I want to be hearing.
30503480	30505480	Oh!
30505480	30507480	Oh!
30507480	30509480	Oh!
30509480	30511480	Mommy, are you in thrall?
30511480	30513480	Am I allowed to be?
30515480	30517480	She wants us to send.
30517480	30521480	Other than the pain part, I don't want to cause any pain.
30527480	30529480	Okay.
30529480	30531480	It seemed rather safe.
30533480	30535480	It's rather dark around these parts.
30535480	30537480	Let me pop a wee light on,
30537480	30539480	just so we can see what we're doing.
30543480	30545480	Okay.
30545480	30547480	Statue's coming alive, that's fine.
30547480	30549480	Jump on.
30549480	30551480	Are you squidding me right now?
30551480	30553480	But stomp my face, anime woman.
30555480	30557480	Yes, awesome.
30557480	30559480	Thank you for the two.
30559480	30561480	Oh, butt stomp!
30561480	30563480	I thought you meant butt.
30563480	30565480	Is that like a question?
30565480	30567480	Yeah.
30567480	30569480	You're more than welcome.
30569480	30571480	Oh no!
30571480	30573480	But then you can come back.
30573480	30575480	That's my face!
30575480	30577480	Oh my god, look!
30577480	30579480	It's my face as player model!
30579480	30581480	Check it out!
30581480	30583480	I got eyes, but aren't eyes?
30583480	30585480	Oh!
30585480	30587480	Wow!
30587480	30589480	It's kind of cool to see the inside mechanics
30589480	30591480	that we lost in the first place.
30593480	30595480	Thank you for you.
30595480	30597480	I can't progress unless all gone.
30597480	30599480	If you click multiplayer and then press Duff Finger,
30599480	30601480	it's like multiplayer
30601480	30603480	and then hit the finger saber.
30603480	30605480	I don't want to kick, I feel like...
30611480	30613480	Let's see.
30613480	30615480	What's behind cave number one?
30615480	30617480	Dragon's Pit.
30617480	30619480	Okay.
30619480	30621480	I don't know if I got reason to use this one.
30621480	30623480	Ain't it nice?
30623480	30625480	Ain't it just grand?
30625480	30627480	I need some.
30629480	30631480	Wait a minute.
30631480	30633480	We're in a place called
30633480	30635480	Dragon's Pit today.
30635480	30637480	Norm, have you had a show?
30637480	30639480	I don't think...
30639480	30641480	I think Norm and then Oz.
30641480	30643480	Again, if I forget the order,
30643480	30645480	I'm really sorry.
30646480	30648480	Can't summon in there.
30648480	30650480	At least I couldn't.
30652480	30654480	They may have done some quiet
30654480	30656480	hot patches, possibly.
30656480	30658480	I don't know.
30658480	30660480	For like quick fixes like that.
30660480	30662480	I assume the area...
30662480	30664480	He's not the thinker!
30664480	30666480	Nice job, Lazer.
30666480	30668480	One step closer to getting a screaming coconut.
30668480	30670480	So I need to say she's got a bit of diamonds, so...
30672480	30674480	Yeah?
30674480	30676480	What are you gonna do? You fart?
30676480	30678480	I need to kiss other leaflings.
30682480	30684480	Wait, I'll call up to you. Get ready.
30684480	30686480	And then I need to kiss you.
30686480	30688480	No! Oh, there's enemies everywhere!
30688480	30690480	Hold on, I'm trying to kiss the leaflings.
30690480	30692480	Don't be so rude.
30692480	30694480	Whoa, there's one behind us!
30694480	30696480	Chase!
30699480	30701480	Are we okay?
30701480	30703480	Everyone okay?
30703480	30705480	Oh, there's a fake wall here.
30705480	30707480	Oh wait, that's not a fake wall.
30707480	30709480	Dung ahead, as in nothing ahead?
30711480	30714480	Okay, soothing stone level one.
30714480	30716480	Yeah, maybe it is dung ahead.
30716480	30718480	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! He's back?
30718480	30720480	Does he infinitely spawn?
30720480	30722480	Oh, you need to whack him again.
30722480	30724480	If they have the little ghost thingy,
30724480	30726480	you need to be whack.
30726480	30728480	She's allergic to rest.
30728480	30730480	This sounds terrible, but at this moment in time,
30730480	30732480	I can't sleep properly.
30732480	30736480	So my logic is that I might as well...
30736480	30740480	Because if I go lie down and I can't sleep,
30740480	30742480	I will be so annoyed that I went offline
30742480	30745480	when we could have played some more together.
30745480	30747480	So instead of doing that, I'm like,
30747480	30750480	well, I'm probably guaranteed to pass out instantly.
30750480	30752480	Oh shit, I missed.
30752480	30754480	Because if I pass out instantly,
30754480	30757480	then I'll get more than enough sleep.
30757480	30758480	Does that make sense?
30758480	30760480	That makes terrible sense.
30760480	30762480	But it's kind of the truth.
30763480	30765480	Have you tried ASMR?
30765480	30768480	I watch video games to sleep too,
30768480	30771480	like people playing video games that have an interest in.
30771480	30774480	I currently watch Binding of Isaac gameplay.
30774480	30776480	I'm not very good at it,
30776480	30778480	before anyone's like,
30778480	30781480	oh my god, AMLG Pro, no, I'm just...
30781480	30783480	I just watch, like,
30783480	30785480	because I've been watching Boutro to sleep,
30785480	30787480	I've been watching Binding of Isaac to sleep.
30787480	30789480	I've been watching Civ 6.
30789480	30791480	I can't understand it.
30791480	30793480	But I've been watching people play it,
30793480	30795480	and I think it's probably one of those games
30795480	30799480	that I'll play when I retire, basically.
30799480	30803480	Holy shit, he's putting magma everywhere.
30806480	30808480	Is he supposed to do that?
30808480	30810480	Ow, like, it burns.
30810480	30812480	It burns, everything burns.
30812480	30814480	Oh my god, this whole cave is burning.
30815480	30818480	Like, I don't think I could play Civ 6
30818480	30820480	to make it fun without having, like,
30820480	30822480	actual game time in it.
30822480	30825480	There's just some games that aren't good for strumming.
30827480	30830480	And I would say
30830480	30832480	Civ 6, when you're not
30832480	30834480	experienced with it at all,
30834480	30836480	is one of the...wait, am I being done?
30837480	30839480	He's still up, wait, what's his health?
30839480	30840480	Oh no, he's going down.
30840480	30842480	Wait, hold on, I need to restore my stamina.
30843480	30845480	I need my stamina.
30846480	30848480	Oh my god, he's stuck.
30848480	30850480	That's a cool design.
30850480	30852480	Honestly, I'm so down for a dragon.
30852480	30854480	Actually, I need to mention that
30854480	30856480	to the concept artist.
30856480	30858480	I'm really interested in developing
30858480	30860480	a lollipop dragon
30860480	30863480	with a very unique color palette.
30863480	30866480	Ancient dragon smithing stone, yeah.
30867480	30869480	I wish that worked for me,
30869480	30871480	even if I'm disgustingly ghosted.
30871480	30872480	I can still be up.
30872480	30874480	No, like, my brain will be like,
30874480	30876480	you've had enough.
30876480	30878480	And I think I'm going to hit it
30878480	30880480	if I keep going,
30880480	30881480	which is what I want.
30881480	30884480	So this is, like, tactfully streaming.
30884480	30886480	Like, I don't want streamers like,
30886480	30887480	oh, you're going to rest.
30887480	30889480	I'm so tired, you're going to rest.
30889480	30893480	Me, like, now let's push the fucking limit.
30893480	30894480	Like, let's push one.
30894480	30896480	Okay, we're going down this time.
30897480	30899480	Fucking hell, man.
30903480	30906480	But if I caught any of the vealer girls doing this,
30906480	30908480	no, they're getting spanked and put into bed.
30908480	30910480	I'm coming to their hooses.
30911480	30912480	I'm going to their hooses.
30912480	30914480	I think they can get away with this.
30914480	30916480	Only I'm allowed to do this.
30918480	30919480	Ooh, there's a bull.
30919480	30920480	Oh, look!
30920480	30922480	It's the sip bull that I kicked.
30922480	30923480	Oh!
30926480	30928480	Was I supposed to do that?
30928480	30931480	Oh, my God.
30934480	30936480	I didn't know we were supposed to do that.
30936480	30938480	I was so happy about the sip bull
30938480	30942480	that I was going to cook for everyone on the farm.
30942480	30946480	Oh, my God, I had a damn heart attack.
30946480	30948480	Right, Ian's ready.
30948480	30949480	Are you steady?
30949480	30950480	I have no idea what's behind.
30950480	30952480	But let's do it!
30952480	30954480	Oh, shit, I don't have my crossbow out.
30954480	30955480	Oh, shit.
30955480	30956480	Okay, melee.
30956480	30957480	Whoa, wait.
30957480	30958480	You're...
30960480	30963480	Okay, it looks like bleed damage, athletic build.
30963480	30965480	Super skinny Malinky.
30966480	30968480	Terrible poise.
30968480	30970480	That's what we like to see.
30970480	30971480	Unable to resist.
30971480	30973480	Hold on, I need to recharge my stamina.
30977480	30978480	Oh, my God.
30978480	30980480	This is my kind of fight.
30981480	30982480	Yeah!
30982480	30983480	That's right.
30983480	30985480	Get a staggered, get a staggered, get a staggered.
30985480	30987480	Oh, that's my kind of fight.
30987480	30988480	I love it here.
30988480	30989480	Hello.
30989480	30990480	Hello.
30990480	30992480	Dragon Hunter's great katana.
30992480	30993480	Yeah, definitely.
30993480	30995480	Me look like a samurai build type thing to that.
30995480	30997480	Do you guys always have to go...
30997480	30999480	I said, I'm installing a mod right now.
30999480	31002480	That means you guys get to, like, hang around after you do a boss fight with me.
31002480	31005480	Strony, are you telling me I need to spank you
31005480	31007480	when I need to look after you?
31007480	31009480	It's the only way I'll listen.
31009480	31011480	If he looks after you, Strony, then we sling.
31011480	31013480	And we spank me as well.
31014480	31016480	Three stack on it is easy.
31016480	31018480	Plop, plop, plop, get staggered, get staggered, get staggered.
31018480	31020480	There's a head coming.
31020480	31022480	Did I unlock a...
31022480	31024480	Did I unlock anything?
31024480	31025480	No.
31025480	31026480	Yeah.
31028480	31031480	I swear if an enemy pops out, it's one of these things.
31031480	31033480	Oh, thank goodness.
31033480	31035480	Oh, thank you.
31036480	31037480	Touch me.
31039480	31042480	Can I summon the Duman?
31044480	31046480	It's not a punishment if you enjoy it.
31046480	31050480	I don't think I can summon you guys at Dragon's Fit Termina.
31050480	31052480	Go outside, okay.
31054480	31057480	Streamer gets told to go outside and touch grass.
31057480	31058480	Yeah.
31066480	31069480	Analysing foot of the jagged peak.
31073480	31075480	Hmm, I wonder if there's a dragon fight ahead.
31075480	31077480	I don't know, I just have some weird inclination.
31077480	31079480	There might be a dragon fight ahead.
31079480	31081480	No idea why.
31081480	31083480	I think there might be a dragon fight ahead.
31087480	31089480	Oh, there's that flame guy.
31091480	31093480	Go to the cave's entrance, link back.
31096480	31098480	Can you guys put it down here?
31108480	31111480	Okay, if you guys go to Dragon's Fit Termina,
31111480	31113480	you can really come outside.
31113480	31116480	Why is there only 50 areas?
31117480	31120480	Map required ahead, therefore, water side.
31125480	31127480	Sorry, I didn't realize it wasn't active.
31127480	31128480	I thought it was the map.
31128480	31129480	Oh, there you are.
31129480	31130480	Okay.
31130480	31132480	There wasn't any pineapple.
31132480	31134480	We knew an ally.
31134480	31137480	Oh, my brain's getting marshed.
31137480	31140480	I can't remember who was who
31140480	31142480	and who wasn't who.
31142480	31144480	I'm trying my best.
31144480	31146480	I'm so sorry.
31146480	31149480	I can't remember anymore, my brain.
31149480	31151480	I'm trying, I'm trying.
31151480	31153480	I promise I'm trying.
31156480	31159480	Can't grab the map in this area, so it's blind.
31159480	31161480	Or just run past the dragon to the right.
31161480	31162480	Not, I need to say.
31162480	31163480	Okay.
31164480	31166480	I'm well very...
31166480	31168480	Oh, sorry.
31169480	31171480	There's so many allegations.
31171480	31172480	Might be found in the...
31172480	31174480	Oh, no, who doesn't come in?
31174480	31176480	Is it DC?
31176480	31179480	Unable to summon 4 partners.
31179480	31180480	Someone's got...
31180480	31183480	Someone's internet does not like me.
31191480	31193480	I like how you have a staff to point the way.
31193480	31195480	It's pretty good.
31196480	31199480	Remember that thing that Wiefling blocked me from falling?
31199480	31200480	Oh, no, sorry.
31200480	31203480	All three Wieflings blocked me from falling to my death
31203480	31205480	because you all knew fine well.
31205480	31208480	I would have kept walking because I was blabbing away talking on stream.
31208480	31209480	That was very cute.
31209480	31211480	I like that moment.
31211480	31212480	I'd be...
31212480	31216480	Maybe I should get a commemorative doodle for that as well.
31216480	31220480	I want a commemorative doodle of you guys carrying me through Elden Ring.
31220480	31223480	And then maybe I'll just get like a doodle meme.
31223480	31225480	One of those colored doodles in memes.
31225480	31227480	And it's like, stop, don't go.
31227480	31233480	And then like I'm saying something like some capitals ran as I usually do.
31233480	31238480	And like you guys are like blocking me from walking forward.
31238480	31241480	That would be funny.
31242480	31244480	Mm-hmm.
31251480	31252480	Wait.
31252480	31254480	Oh, no, the dragon is alive.
31254480	31255480	Hold on.
31255480	31256480	What do we do?
31256480	31259480	Are we just avoiding by going right?
31259480	31261480	I think we're avoiding by going right side.
31261480	31263480	I can do that.
31264480	31270480	That's a very sleepy dragon.
31270480	31272480	Very, very sleepy dragon.
31272480	31273480	Okay.
31273480	31275480	If he's a slumber, he doesn't have to.
31275480	31281480	Three Reflings carrying Strony on a palanquin.
31281480	31285480	Oh Reflings, what's a palanquin?
31285480	31288480	Is it the Egypt chair?
31288480	31289480	Like you...
31289480	31290480	Whoa.
31291480	31292480	Yeah, damn.
31292480	31294480	What are they feeding you?
31294480	31296480	You guys still eat GMO food?
31296480	31298480	This is what's happening to your GMO...
31298480	31303480	Yes, it's also something called a litter.
31303480	31305480	I'll unsummon you.
31305480	31306480	Fuck that.
31306480	31307480	Isn't it your bedtime?
31307480	31311480	5 p.m. is my actual bedtime, but I'm trying to flip my sleep.
31311480	31314480	So I fall asleep right now.
31314480	31318480	5 p.m. is my actual bedtime, but I'm trying to flip my sleep.
31318480	31322480	So I fall asleep right after stream.
31322480	31324480	So I can wake up at 1.
31324480	31327480	So if I do fall asleep right now,
31327480	31330480	I'm gonna be like after the end of stream.
31330480	31332480	If I fall asleep instantly,
31332480	31335480	I will have done my sleep the way I want it to be.
31335480	31337480	What is banging and thrashing about?
31337480	31338480	I can hear it.
31338480	31343480	Who making all that damn noise?
31343480	31345480	Oh, I hope he's dead.
31345480	31349480	I don't want his furry body to be...
31349480	31350480	suffering.
31350480	31352480	Oh, that is a flame?
31352480	31355480	I can see him.
31355480	31360480	No, I think he definitely gone, the fur guy.
31360480	31363480	Oh, it's the dragon's heartbeat?
31363480	31370480	I see a stone dragon, but his heart still pulses?
31370480	31372480	The noise is ugly on a farm.
31372480	31373480	Are you getting your stuff?
31373480	31378480	Did I touch it?
31378480	31380480	Oh, examine.
31380480	31384480	Communion with bail.
31384480	31390480	Additional items required, okay.
31390480	31393480	Virtual dragon communication.
31393480	31395480	Offering a dragon heart, ghost breath.
31395480	31399480	Channels, dragons, just use a flame.
31399480	31403480	Right, so I don't need to do any of that.
31403480	31405480	Okay.
31405480	31408480	We claimed the dragon?
31408480	31412480	Like in the other one?
31412480	31413480	Wait, what?
31413480	31415480	Oh, there's someone here talk to.
31415480	31417480	Oh.
31417480	31419480	Eject yourself.
31419480	31422480	Feasting upon a dragon's essence.
31422480	31423480	Yeah.
31423480	31425480	On the throbbing heart of the oldest,
31425480	31429480	violent dragon of them all.
31429480	31433480	It would be the purest form of communion.
31433480	31436480	The fullest sating of your hunger
31436480	31440480	and your consummation as a dragon.
31440480	31441480	She wants to become part dragon?
31441480	31442480	Oh, she is?
31442480	31447480	Look at her hands on the devourer?
31447480	31453480	Eat?
31453480	31455480	Eat or no eat?
31455480	31461480	Eat wagon or no eat wagon?
31461480	31465480	Hmm.
31465480	31466480	Oh, it's a sin.
31466480	31467480	Do not partake.
31467480	31470480	You have yet to be a true one.
31470480	31472480	I am patient.
31472480	31475480	There will come a day when hunger knocks.
31475480	31476480	I don't know, man.
31476480	31478480	You don't look like this.
31478480	31479480	You don't look like this.
31479480	31480480	You look like this.
31480480	31486480	Okay, let's go.
31486480	31490480	I wonder if it gives you like a special thing you can do.
31490480	31493480	Yeah, the airtree don't like when you start messing with dragons stuff.
31493480	31496480	Okay.
31496480	31499480	The sound of standing on the scales
31499480	31507480	almost gravel-like.
31507480	31509480	It sounds like cabbage, honestly.
31509480	31511480	I'm wondering what foley sound they use for it.
31511480	31518480	It sounds like cabbage.
31518480	31521480	Okay.
31521480	31524480	Oh, is this the red flowers?
31524480	31525480	Oh, my God.
31525480	31529480	No, that's putting me to sleep because of the hue.
31529480	31532480	I need to get out of here.
31532480	31533480	Oh, no.
31533480	31537480	New area load.
31537480	31539480	New area load.
31539480	31541480	I'm afraid we fling.
31541480	31543480	It's the same.
31543480	31546480	Where are we on the map?
31546480	31547480	Yeah.
31547480	31549480	Damn, this map just keeps getting bigger and bigger.
31549480	31550480	Oh, we are on the red.
31550480	31556480	We're about to do a big U-turn to that blue thing, I thought.
31556480	31559480	Is that all the blue things?
31559480	31561480	Oh, no.
31561480	31565480	Shadow is hitting three.
31565480	31575480	I feel blessed to show the beauty of this human coconut tunnel.
31575480	31576480	Lord ahead.
31576480	31581480	Okay, I'm not going down there, then.
31581480	31595480	I'll go up and pray that there's something up here.
31595480	31597480	Bruh.
31597480	31599480	You've never been mean to me before.
31599480	31601480	Why are you being mean to me now?
31601480	31604480	The moment my refunds disappear, the game's like,
31604480	31608480	let me just go absolutely eat on you.
31608480	31614480	No, I'll go to the marina.
31614480	31615480	Not secure anymore.
31615480	31616480	No, I think I'll back.
31616480	31618480	Honestly, try to terrify me like that.
31618480	31620480	It's working.
31620480	31623480	I don't really want to get attacked by a marina because they have distance magic,
31623480	31625480	but I'm just going to go for it.
31625480	31630480	And then get past real quick.
31630480	31631480	I'm here.
31631480	31633480	I'm casting off a little spell.
31633480	31638480	Sorry, can't reach me.
31638480	31640480	Okay, I'm happy with this.
31640480	31641480	I'll take this.
31641480	31642480	I don't know what it is.
31642480	31643480	What it does.
31643480	31645480	I don't know where it is.
31645480	31647480	I'll take it.
31647480	31649480	Give me a...
31649480	31653480	Okay, this is called...
31653480	31655480	Rest well, those who need to sleep.
31655480	31657480	Yes, please don't feel bad about needing to sleep.
31657480	31659480	I feel you.
31659480	31661480	I feel you.
31661480	31662480	This is called...
31662480	31667480	Shadows Hidden Grieve.
31667480	31670480	I think I can come here.
31670480	31672480	I'm pretty sure it just has cute...
31672480	31673480	No, my cute worm does.
31673480	31675480	Literally, the worms are so nice.
31675480	31677480	Oh my God, worm and gentoo?
31677480	31679480	Question mark?
31679480	31687480	Worm beach ever?
31687480	31690480	Wait, why are you smacking me?
31691480	31694480	I'm sure I heard it.
31694480	31696480	I went to do...
31696480	31703480	Would you still love a beach over if she was a worm?
31703480	31704480	Possibly.
31704480	31712480	I wonder where the reviews are so far so good.
31712480	31715480	Wait, is that the bottom of the map?
31715480	31722480	Or is that you can go even further down?
31722480	31727480	I don't see any enemies though.
31727480	31735480	If I spot an enemy, it means you can go down there.
31735480	31737480	You can go even further down?
31737480	31742480	Oh my God.
31742480	31744480	Oh, there's a statue...
31744480	31746480	Oh no, there's a church there.
31746480	31749480	I have terrible news, Reeflands.
31749480	31754480	I don't think...
31754480	31759480	I don't think you guys can come in.
31759480	31766480	You get there's that ravine there that I just completely avoided down the street.
31766480	31768480	It's a shite of heads.
31768480	31770480	Strong, poor heads.
31770480	31773480	Why can't I get Reeflands in them?
31773480	31777480	If I've not done it.
31777480	31778480	Oh, for goodness sake.
31778480	31780480	It's just that stupid thing where it's like, cancel.
31780480	31781480	Okay, that makes a lot more sense.
31781480	31784480	I was like, oh, you've not been in for a bit.
31784480	31787480	I was like, oh no, is everyone like unable to...
31787480	31788480	to get in?
31788480	31791480	But it says there's a nullify effect thing.
31791480	31796480	I didn't find out what you're using.
31796480	31798480	Thank you, gay Disney.
31798480	31801480	Did you not...?
31801480	31803480	Again, I'm so sorry.
31803480	31804480	I'm forgetting.
31804480	31808480	I'm not even able to write English anymore, seriously.
31808480	31810480	This list is getting out of hand.
31810480	31811480	Oh no, wait.
31811480	31813480	I did it wrong.
31813480	31815480	Oh no, did someone time out already?
31815480	31818480	How did you time out that fast?
31818480	31820480	Okay, we've got evil.
31820480	31822480	No, whoa, everyone's timing out.
31822480	31824480	What's going on here?
31824480	31825480	Can anyone...?
31825480	31830480	Okay, we've got one in.
31830480	31837480	It's like timing the fuck out.
31837480	31840480	I haven't done this yet, Montoya.
31840480	31843480	For evil reason.
31843480	31849480	I think it's just the neck.
31849480	31852480	I don't know what kind of fate we got ahead of us.
31852480	31862480	So we're going to do it.
31862480	31865480	Got hit by a connection sign or something.
31865480	31866480	Oh, there we go.
31866480	31868480	You both come in the same thing.
31868480	31870480	Are we ready?
31870480	31874480	Are we ready?
31874480	31880480	Wait, are you telling us to go that way?
31880480	31881480	I realize we're going this way.
31881480	31882480	My bad.
31882480	31883480	I thought we were going to go where?
31883480	31890480	Where's the other one?
31890480	31904480	Where is the mariner guy?
31904480	31921480	Oh, no, I have to fucking respawn you.
31921480	31923480	Oh, yeah, couldn't, right?
31923480	31927480	We just got together.
31927480	31931480	Oh, Reeflings, I ask you kindly please leave so we can move to the next bit.
31931480	31932480	Hold on.
31932480	31937480	I'm going to readjust my cosy cover.
31937480	31939480	I'm getting ready to sleep.
31939480	31943480	We're doing a sleep stream, you guys, so listen to me for it.
31943480	31946480	I'm literally just people cosy and moat now.
31946480	31948480	It's over my head and everything.
31948480	31953480	Oh, I'm getting nice and calm.
31953480	31958480	Mommy's yawn.
31958480	31965480	I need to put it over me so I'm all nice and cool.
31965480	31974480	You need to charge my controller.
31974480	31978480	Can you guys come down here and then I summon you here?
31978480	31979480	Can we be that cheeky?
31979480	31983480	Can we be that deviant?
31983480	31999480	Okay, I'll see you at the bottom.
31999480	32002480	She says she doesn't see a summoning site.
32002480	32005480	Is this a boss site?
32005480	32007480	There's a grass, okay.
32007480	32009480	Are you disabled again?
32009480	32022480	Ah, fuck, let's see.
32022480	32030480	Don't you need to be on top to get the spoon?
32030480	32031480	I'm like trying to look.
32031480	32036480	I can see an enemy at the gravestone.
32036480	32039480	Where did I go? Up there?
32039480	32042480	Oh, if I go there to head, I'll knock them out.
32042480	32053480	I assume there's going to be a safe community there.
32053480	32063480	Oh, Torrent, how you keep me so safe?
32063480	32068480	That's too little bit of architecture.
32068480	32070480	Oh, did I pass it?
32070480	32072480	I'll tell you what, we'll go to the next one.
32072480	32075480	I think there must be something over here because the map's over here.
32075480	32079480	And the worms are friendly again.
32079480	32080480	Yeah, that's right.
32080480	32082480	You better be friendly again.
32082480	32083480	You stinky stinkerkin.
32083480	32085480	I like how their face is red.
32085480	32092480	Just show that they're not friendly.
32092480	32095480	Okay, let's see what we're looking at.
32095480	32098480	Okay, okay, so we are heading to the dead end.
32098480	32102480	So I assume that means like, oh, there's going to be a boss.
32102480	32105480	Let's see if we can get a save.
32105480	32109480	I do want a save site at this point.
32109480	32111480	Okay, at least there's one right there.
32111480	32115480	And then there's some angry worms over there.
32115480	32119480	Okay, let's go to this save site.
32119480	32124480	I can see this crab.
32124480	32127480	I need to get the map so I can continue to build.
32127480	32131480	Wow, the game doesn't let you progress.
32131480	32141480	Are these nectar blood virgins?
32141480	32146480	Okay.
32146480	32147480	How do I get to level up?
32147480	32148480	I actually have quite a lot.
32148480	32151480	I've got a new lesson.
32151480	32153480	Right, and then level up.
32153480	32154480	Okay, I do.
32154480	32156480	There's not too many of them.
32156480	32159480	The first six HP is rough.
32159480	32163480	Does someone say...
32163480	32169480	Is it arcane?
32169480	32172480	Is it intelligence to spray my crossbow?
32172480	32173480	I can't remember.
32174480	32179480	Or is it faith to spray the crossbow?
32179480	32180480	I don't know.
32180480	32184480	I mean, maybe just endurance.
32184480	32186480	Okay, I'll go back to Bale.
32186480	32190480	I didn't know about that drop down from up top.
32190480	32192480	No, no, no.
32192480	32194480	Arcane?
32194480	32195480	Maybe not arcane.
32195480	32197480	Alright, I'll just do endurance.
32197480	32199480	Why not?
32199480	32202480	Oh, someone says intelligence.
32202480	32204480	Magic.
32204480	32206480	That's not magic, defense up.
32206480	32207480	That's main.
32207480	32208480	Main does...
32208480	32211480	Oh, main does just like the do-do-do-do-do-do.
32211480	32214480	Okay.
32214480	32216480	Does shove in endurance then?
32216480	32219480	Does it really matter at this point?
32219480	32222480	No, when I go my reasons to look after me.
32222480	32223480	Okay, sorry.
32223480	32225480	Someone says teleport.
32225480	32227480	Go to the grand altar.
32227480	32230480	Now that we have the map,
32230480	32235480	we can grand altar of dragon communication.
32235480	32238480	Oh, communion, sorry.
32238480	32242480	Main is mana, so it's good for everyone,
32242480	32246480	not just me, just when I do my little ultimate.
32246480	32248480	I have no idea where you guys are taking me,
32248480	32252480	but dragon altar.
32252480	32257480	Come, come, come.
32257480	32260480	I'm just gonna pretend that's a good sound
32260480	32263480	and not at all the most dangerous sound ever,
32263480	32266480	like something like stomping around that's so humongous.
32266480	32270480	It takes like 20 seconds to stomp its other foot.
32275480	32277480	Wah.
32283480	32286480	Wait, you disconnect?
32286480	32288480	Right there.
32288480	32291480	Put away, look, put away.
32291480	32294480	I've actually got quite a few new ones there.
32294480	32295480	Let's switch it out.
32295480	32299480	I want to do the new one.
32299480	32301480	Uh...
32301480	32303480	Mm-hmm.
32303480	32308480	Mm-hmm.
32308480	32309480	I want all mother.
32309480	32312480	What does all mother look like?
32312480	32315480	Oh, refling, oh, refling.
32315480	32318480	Please forgive me for being so bad.
32318480	32320480	Mm-hmm.
32320480	32322480	Okay, let's get enemy.
32322480	32323480	Shlumpling, were you in last?
32323480	32326480	I think Shlumpling, you came with us last time.
32326480	32328480	Okay, light the way.
32328480	32331480	Where the heck are we supposed to go?
32331480	32334480	But once...
32334480	32335480	I don't like that.
32335480	32336480	That sounds so ominous.
32336480	32338480	Wait, once the enemy refling comes in,
32338480	32340480	are we going up this way?
32340480	32341480	Okay.
32341480	32343480	Enemy refling's spawning in.
32346480	32347480	Oh, yes.
32347480	32349480	No way.
32349480	32351480	Let's go.
32351480	32357480	Right, follow the glowing refling in the distance.
32357480	32359480	Follow him.
32359480	32361480	Follow him.
32361480	32366480	For he's gonna lead us to success.
32366480	32370480	And he's gonna lead us to the end of me.
32370480	32371480	Oh.
32371480	32373480	That was definitely not to the song.
32373480	32376480	I would stay with me.
32376480	32381480	Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.
32381480	32383480	Oh my god, I completely forgot
32383480	32387480	I was gonna try and do parody songs.
32387480	32391480	Holy shit, I've like completely forgotten them.
32391480	32395480	Oh, I don't have the fail on me.
32395480	32398980	I'll leak my files on the members' stream, how about that?
32400780	32403080	I wanted to do a parody song
32403780	32407880	because last time we played Elden Ring, I got killed by One Thrust
32408280	32411780	and I was like, One Thrust is all it took
32412280	32415480	but you know that song is One Kiss is all it takes
32416280	32420580	and I was trying to write a fucking dumbass parody song of it
32420580	32423080	and I was like, One Thrust is all it took
32423580	32427980	and all the possibilities, it was so bad
32427980	32433980	but I came up with another one for Azura and Sheeby
32435480	32438180	and I don't know if it's gonna come out shit or not
32438180	32441080	it's like the most simple basic parody
32443280	32444180	but do you know the song?
32444180	32445380	Do You Like Waffles?
32445380	32446580	Do You Like Waffles?
32446580	32447780	Do You Like Pancakes?
32447780	32448980	Do You Like Pancakes?
32448980	32450180	Do You Like French Toast?
32450180	32451280	Do You Like French Toast?
32452280	32455380	It's Gonna Wait To Get Enough Of Waffles
32455880	32459680	Basically, I wrote a parody of that and it's hags
32459680	32461380	and it's like, Do You Like Hag Lips?
32461380	32462580	Do You Like Hag Lips?
32462580	32463880	Do You Like Hag Hips?
32463880	32465780	Do You Like Hag Hips?
32465780	32466980	Do You Like Hag Hips?
32466980	32468280	Do You Like Hag Hips?
32468280	32471380	It's Can't Wait To Get Enough Of Hags
32471380	32474480	basically, but I've never recorded it or none
32476380	32478880	and I was gonna have it
32478980	32483980	that the music video has Azura and Sheeby fan art in it
32489280	32492280	Hag Love basically is the hook
32492280	32493380	so I need to make that
32493380	32499980	so I've been secretly pervading any Sheeby and Azura fan art
32499980	32501780	because I want to make that
32501780	32504380	and like I want like all the fan art to be shown off
32504380	32505680	and like oh special thank you
32505680	32508780	like we'll put like all the credit in the video and all that
32508780	32510580	I thought that would be really sweet
32513080	32514080	that would be so cool
32514080	32516080	Yeah, I had another one
32516080	32520280	and it was like a schizophrenia parody
32520280	32522780	that sounds really bad saying it out loud
32522780	32524480	but you know how like oh you have schizophrenia
32524480	32526080	because da da da da da
32526080	32528780	and then obviously I was like okay what's
32528780	32531680	oh I can't remember what the song parody is
32533780	32535380	oh it's that it girl
32535380	32538080	I T G I R L
32539380	32540880	it's an it girl parody
32540880	32542580	oh what does the song go like
32544480	32550880	A T I G I T G I R L
32553680	32557480	basically the song spells out a six letters
32557480	32560680	and then I was going to change it to get so like yeah
32560680	32562980	she's get so oh fuck I can't remember it though
32563880	32565380	what we're gonna have to manually claim
32565380	32566780	or do you guys have to get out
32567780	32571080	so I like I'm not kidding like I plan so much stuff in advance
32571080	32574580	I was gonna do like one parody song per month
32574580	32576080	just for the shits and giggles
32576080	32579080	and that hag one is probably the only one
32579080	32582480	that's actually even plausible for me to record at this point
32582480	32585680	the other what the fuck are you doing
32585680	32588580	what did you do to the shade
32588580	32590580	okay I need to go up
32590580	32592080	okay I understand I understand
32592680	32596580	and so I've got like one thrust is all it took for the reef
32596580	32599980	line I've got a hag love song
32601580	32605180	and and before someone like listen to this and steals it
32605180	32607180	and uploads it and be like no you can't prove it
32608380	32609980	you have to try again try again
32612380	32615380	fuck it up fuck it up
32616580	32618880	what a fucking view that was honestly
32618880	32620480	where are we at bridge
32621480	32624680	oh my god
32626180	32629680	um what an earth are we like walking towards
32630780	32633680	I can't remember any of the other parody songs I am
32635280	32636680	I am I made
32637980	32640380	I say made is basically someone else's
32640380	32643380	and like the melodies all there
32643380	32645180	I just swap out the words to whatever I want
32645180	32646680	but I guess that's what a parody is

33304480	33306480	oh my god

33312480	33314480	Brooklyn
33314480	33316480	oh no I think we might be out of our
33316480	33318480	depth I'm like
33322480	33324480	oh my god he's only got one leg
33324480	33326480	he's like a wee amputee
33326480	33328480	of a dragon and every
33328480	33330480	wait does he only have one leg
33330480	33332480	or am I just making it up
33332480	33334480	he does
33334480	33336480	his wee per leg
33341480	33343480	oh my god
33354480	33356480	you know I'm actually doing pretty well
33356480	33358480	taking a whack from a dragon outside man
33358480	33360480	right his tail is in my face
33360480	33362480	of course I'm gonna hit it
33362480	33364480	not miss it
33364480	33366480	oh my god I'm way out of my depth here
33366480	33368480	Reefland
33372480	33374480	it's like impossible
33374480	33376480	to predict what he's gonna do
33383480	33385480	okay so he gets a bit
33385480	33387480	stuck when he does the fire
33390480	33392480	I can't even reach his little
33392480	33394480	meaty gammy leg
33394480	33396480	oh my god
33396480	33398480	literally disabling
33398480	33400480	disabling
33400480	33402480	bullying a disabled dragon
33402480	33404480	that feels so bad right now
33404480	33406480	I'm not sure how I feel about this
33406480	33408480	it seems awfully ableist to me
33411480	33413480	oh I'm getting cornered
33417480	33419480	well
33419480	33421480	I'm not sure we're gonna get past him
33421480	33423480	he's a dragon that tore
33423480	33425480	off
33428480	33430480	haven't seen gammy for a long time
33430480	33432480	he's grown this much
33432480	33434480	why is she so mad at ya
33434480	33436480	I have terrible news
33436480	33438480	I think we might have to do
33438480	33440480	something else cause
33441480	33443480	there's no way my pitiful
33443480	33445480	crossbow ball is gonna do a thing
33445480	33447480	maybe if I do blood damage
33450480	33452480	I'll just do bleed and then
33452480	33454480	if it's a dragon I guess I'll use
33454480	33456480	ace against the dragon
33456480	33458480	maybe that's how it works
33458480	33460480	that's how it totally works right
33467480	33469480	we can do it are you sure
33471480	33473480	I don't mean to be a doer
33473480	33475480	but that dragon
33475480	33477480	are you sure
33477480	33479480	I think it would be easier
33479480	33481480	to kill the bucket fire guy
33481480	33483480	honestly we got
33483480	33485480	bucket fire face to half
33486480	33488480	I mean I know that was just her first attempt
33488480	33490480	and I did pitiful but
33492480	33494480	I'm a bit insimidated ok
33494480	33496480	I'm a bit insimidated
33496480	33498480	we'll see what we can do
33498480	33500480	we'll see what we can do
33503480	33505480	does anyone have spiral shard
33506480	33508480	what does that do
33509480	33511480	what does spiral shard do
33511480	33513480	let's see
33513480	33515480	I can't go in
33515480	33517480	we don't know if we can
33517480	33519480	I
33532480	33534480	didn't even hit him
33534480	33536480	nope but he's hitting me
33540480	33542480	ok maybe aim for his body
33544480	33546480	I'm not safe
33547480	33549480	easier just do this
33550480	33552480	manually aiming
33556480	33558480	it is I'm actually hitting him
33558480	33560480	more like this
33560480	33561480	oh for fuck's sake I'm in
33561480	33563480	I'm aiming for his butt
33563480	33565480	go to sleep go to sleep
33565480	33567480	tranquilizer tranquilizer
33567480	33569480	serpentine serpentine
33572480	33574480	does he even have sleep damage
33578480	33580480	I
33581480	33583480	is he going for me
33583480	33585480	I think he might have been
33588480	33590480	is that a glitch
33590480	33592480	what happens if I do A
33592480	33594480	I don't know
33595480	33597480	don't look at me
33601480	33603480	oh shit they're just doing ultimate
33604480	33606480	oh his wee legs
33608480	33610480	uh
33613480	33615480	ok ok hold on a minute
33617480	33619480	we're in the 60s
33625480	33627480	uhh
33627480	33629480	um
33629480	33631480	um um um um um um um um um um
33637480	33649320	Um, I think I've lost question mark.
33649320	33662920	Um, gonna be honest, we'll try it a few more times.
33662920	33670640	I think we're better going back to, um, little snake man.
33670640	33673520	I think our odds are better with snakes.
33673520	33675000	Everyone just exploded.
33675000	33680000	Yes, I definitely agree with that thing.
33680000	33683520	I think we're in trouble.
33683520	33692480	Let's see, let's see, I'll keep doing my bow and arrow bleed effect.
33693480	33696640	Um, I don't mind doing that.
33696640	33699120	Maybe do some dungeon exploring.
33699120	33706320	Yeah, I think if we can't do this, I wouldn't actually mind going back to, um, limb grave
33706320	33711080	and getting like loads of different coconuts and stuff so we can all talk.
33711080	33715520	I think Bailey and the 18 inches of mesmer are equal in terms of difficulty.
33715520	33717400	Oh, oh no.
33717400	33719720	Oh no, this can't be.
33719720	33725520	Um, if that's the case, I might be more tempted to do some like caverns and stuff.
33725520	33727360	Elsewhere.
33727360	33729840	Although, what do I need to do?
33729840	33733480	I just need to level up my stuff.
33733480	33734480	Oh, wow.
33743320	33745320	I need to go on fire resistance.
33750720	33756040	I didn't even get a moment to breathe.
33756040	33762920	Remember when that one guy said, really, la, na, la, was similar in difficulty, honestly.
33762920	33765600	How far into the DLC?
33765600	33768040	We've somewhat uncovered everything.
33768040	33773440	We're stuck at a few bosses, so don't think you're out of your depth.
33773440	33777600	We're currently trying to, I don't want to spoil it, so close your ears if you don't
33777600	33791280	want to spoiler, but, um, mesmer halt progression, bail is just optional.
33791280	33797560	Okay, wait, hold on, who, where or who is mesmer, where is he?
33797560	33805360	Where are you mesmer, you little shit.
33805360	33807600	Dark chamber entrance?
33807600	33808600	Maybe?
33813800	33814800	Dark chamber?
33814800	33815800	Okay.
33815800	33818440	We're going to see what we can do at dark chamber.
33818440	33823960	If this is like the story of like, oh, you're supposed to do this next, um, I don't even
33823960	33830600	know if I have the reaction time to be able to, um, move out of his way when he's the
33830600	33837600	one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the
33837600	33842600	one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the
33842600	33851600	one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the
33851600	33859600	one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the
33859600	33869600	one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the
33869600	33878420	one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the
33878420	33883300	one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the
33883300	33886800	one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who she's
33886800	33900320	He is just rapid fire I'm going for bleep sorry I accidentally did ace for a bit there that's
33900320	33927920	I like all the arrows staying in and I was actually kind of funny.
33927920	33937920	I dodge. Someone got a bleed on him. I don't know who it is but it's a team effort.
33937920	33954760	It's a team effort. Pincushion boss one and three. Right okay okay okay. He needs a minute
33954760	33982080	to get back off the ground. Okay we're not watching this. Why does he hate me so much?
33982080	34010780	I can't even comprehend what's going on I'm sorry I genuinely can. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no.
34010780	34024240	okay I think we can do it I think we can do it I think we can do it I have I have
34024240	34035200	faith I think you did go into his house and attack him I have faith I think we
34035200	34041720	can do it I just won't absolutely walk myself and myself right so I do have
34041720	34044360	the lead
34047520	34054680	this place is supposed to change I'm wondering
34055440	34062000	oh it's a dwelling arrow it's not easy oh I'll do poison and bleep
34064360	34067360	I'll do poison and bleep
34070360	34074800	we just in norm did you have a chance
34074800	34078840	men's room probably actually easier than bail with three people but all the
34078840	34083640	space one attack small space are relatively small and no area yeah I think we
34083640	34096520	can do it flinch files flinched flies what's this raises stamina boost fire
34096520	34102080	damage negation yeah I'm gonna put on that just because it's how unbelievably cruel
34102080	34109520	that guy is ready wow let me get out of the way so we just corner me with that
34109600	34112120	fireball

34124880	34131920	wait I'll go for poison first I guess oh wait snake be poisoned I don't know if
34131920	34141360	snake are considered poisonable we'll find out shortly is he green
34144360	34148360	that is so terrifying that move
34154520	34157520	maybe we're to see
34162920	34170920	oh my god he just hammers and hammers and hammers
34177920	34186600	the fact I am still moving after that shows how tarnished or so OP
34191920	34193920	I
34200640	34205040	tried to bleed oh yeah you got it
34208160	34211560	it's not moving
34213800	34220200	just be careful I will skip the animation
34220200	34224360	okay I'm gonna skip the animation
34224360	34233080	oh and the attack stage of course the stage
34234080	34239760	hey we fling I can sure
34248280	34253360	there's an MCC helping us as well
34258760	34261960	trying to get bleak damage
34263080	34265080	I
34270600	34274840	and PC do you want to do anything
34281560	34287960	are the NPC no one rare which we fling had the dark moon
34288700	34292860	I think they may have gone asleep no
34294980	34299300	yeah Russian is your turn
34308300	34310300	I survived a party
34317960	34321960	He's not got a face on there, more hands to the love pick, even his mum and her despises.
34323960	34325960	Right, we're going for it.
34325960	34327960	We've got champions and stuff going on.
34327960	34331960	Right, let me move to the side and dodge this, should be the chart.
34331960	34335960	So, dodge it and then run away.
34337960	34339960	I can't do...
34339960	34342960	I actually can't do it, lol.
34343960	34346960	Fuckin' hell.
34350960	34352960	He's actually pretty...
34352960	34356960	Taking a decent chunk of damage from a weak book.
34356960	34358960	Can you not...
34358960	34360960	Can you not change enemy at the last second?
34360960	34362960	It really messes me up.
34364960	34366960	Sorry.
34373960	34379960	I think this might be the old, we need a mage type thing and then I'll try and take the aggro.
34379960	34381960	And then melee can try and stun.
34385960	34388960	Fuckin' hell, blind us in the middle of battle.
34388960	34391960	But in a humorous way.
34391960	34403960	Oh, he just changed up on that third refling.
34412960	34414960	Wait, am I alive?
34414960	34417960	Holy shit, I thought I was gone.
34421960	34434960	Oh, man.
34434960	34436960	Oh, I got crit!
34436960	34439960	Oh, shit, he got crit on me though.
34439960	34443960	Oh, no, he got me, I don't survive this.
34444960	34447960	Oh!
34447960	34449960	I think we can do it.
34449960	34453960	I think we can do it, we just need to compliment each other a bit more.
34453960	34457960	Oh, your hair's looking great today.
34457960	34459960	Oh, he switches so quick.
34459960	34467960	Literally the 5 M blow he does, he like swaps between 3 of us at one point.
34467960	34470960	I don't think he takes poison damage.
34471960	34475960	Back from my work and I say I believe in mommy and the refling.
34475960	34478960	I think this is the last one in me, like unironic.
34478960	34480960	Oh god, I can't remember, I didn't have...
34480960	34482960	I definitely didn't have you.
34485960	34488960	I feel like I had you in either, yeah.
34488960	34490960	This is definitely my last one.
34490960	34494960	My eyes are like fuckin' falling out of the sockets right now.
34494960	34497960	I'm sure we can bend from any direction too.
34497960	34500960	But I think we can do it, I think we can do it, we just do it.
34500960	34502960	Hiya!
34502960	34505960	I think we need any blessings?
34505960	34507960	Is that a blessing on us?
34507960	34509960	Any more blessings?
34509960	34511960	Let's do it, let's do it.
34511960	34513960	Let's do it, let's do it.
34513960	34515960	Did I just need a run this time?
34517960	34522960	Oh, I need to wait like a millisecond before I do the next roll.
34523960	34525960	Okay.
34526960	34528960	What are you doing?
34532960	34535960	I'm not focused enough for this.
34535960	34538960	Mommy's time.
34538960	34540960	Unironic then.
34540960	34543960	Oh frickin' just think I just healed up.
34543960	34546960	I need just another one and then...
34546960	34548960	Okay, there we go.
34548960	34550960	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
34553960	34557960	I'm trying to take the aggro, but it ain't happening.
34565960	34567960	Okay.
34570960	34572960	Azze, azze.
34575960	34579960	So I ain't gonna make it to the snake-flicking tier.
34579960	34583960	I don't know how I dodged that with no attempt to dodge that.
34583960	34586960	No, no, no, not like this.
34587960	34590960	Not like this, not like this.
34591960	34596960	I don't even think there's a Wikipedia on like, is he poison immune?
34600960	34603960	I don't think he's a poison immune as far as I'm aware.
34610960	34614960	Although I haven't seen poison go on him, so I'm gonna make a stop.
34615960	34618960	Maybe time for the crossbow.
34620960	34623960	Hopefully you aren't having nightmares of him.
34624960	34629960	It's interesting to see their attack pattern when you don't fight back.
34632960	34634960	Hopefully you aren't not.
34634960	34636960	Check.
34636960	34638960	Mm-hmm.
34639960	34641960	What are you saying?
34644960	34647960	Well, maybe use my crossbow bolt instead.
34648960	34657960	If I do my rapid-fire blood crossbow bolt, it causes rapid-fire crossbow, and then...
34658960	34662960	And I do... I can do scarlet rot, and do frost.
34663960	34666960	I think frost and baked shrilly.
34666960	34671960	I honestly thought it sounded like an alternate word, so I'm gonna be honest.
34672960	34674960	I didn't have you in the last fight.
34676960	34677960	Right.
34677960	34682960	I didn't have you in the last fight, and I didn't have you in the last fight, I'm pretty sure.
34683960	34685960	I'm a 9% sure.
34685960	34686960	Maybe 8%.
34686960	34688960	I messed up, I'm sorry.
34688960	34689960	No, don't be sorry.
34689960	34691960	We're just giving up playing him.
34691960	34692960	I'm having a good time.
34692960	34693960	I may sound tired.
34693960	34694960	Don't get me wrong.
34694960	34700960	I may sound exhausted, but it's nothing to do with the game, and it's nothing to do with these things.
34700960	34705960	It's just I've been having lack of a deep sleep.
34706960	34711960	And then I took medication to try and force myself to sleep, and it just was the nightmare.
34712960	34715960	Okay, dodge, wait, dodge.
34715960	34717960	Yeah, okay, dodge, wait, dodge.
34717960	34718960	There we go.
34719960	34721960	Okay, we're gonna use the ultimate.
34724960	34727960	We're gonna miss everything in the ultimate, but that's okay.
34729960	34730960	Okay.
34733960	34734960	Okay.
34734960	34735960	Okay.
34740960	34745960	I'm wondering if everyone needs to wear the fire talisman to negate more of his attack.
34747960	34749960	Okay, we're gonna...
34754960	34756960	Miss all the walls.
34758960	34760960	I just did the bleed.
34761960	34762960	Oh.
34763960	34765960	And just like that.
34765960	34767960	And then there should be another attack and another.
34770960	34771960	Oh.
34773960	34774960	Oh, shit, the NPC.
34774960	34775960	Maybe I should bring them in.
34775960	34776960	Sorry, hold on.
34776960	34779960	Let me bring in the NPC to take the heat off of everyone a bit.
34781960	34782960	It's such cold summon.
34782960	34783960	Oh, I can't.
34786960	34788960	Only when a frickin' refland is down...
34791960	34792960	Okay.
34806960	34807960	Too early.
34821960	34822960	I'm missing.
34826960	34827960	I'm actually gonna heal.
34828960	34829960	Did we get sneak fees?
34833960	34835960	I did not expect that switch.
34841960	34843960	Oh, no, skipping.
34844960	34846960	Please, thanks for not getting me.
34851960	34852960	Crazy.
34874960	34875960	Sorry, I'm trying.
34875960	34876960	I'm trying.
34879960	34880960	I'm trying.
34885960	34888960	I just need to apply a few bleeds, so that's all I need.
34893960	34894960	Yeah, they're trying me.
34894960	34895960	Okay.
34904960	34907960	It seems like the snake, when the snake goes up, you need to delay your dodging.
34908960	34910960	This part, I don't know about dodging.
34910960	34911960	Okay.
34916960	34917960	I need to heal.
34923960	34926960	We just can hardly do any damage on them.
34926960	34927960	That's the problem.
34930960	34931960	Oh, I'm out.
34931960	34932960	Jesus, I'm out of bleeds.
34933960	34943960	I'm applying cross, whether or not it's gonna achieve anything is a different story, but...
34946960	34948960	Fuckin' hell.
34950960	34951960	It's a barrage.
34951960	34953960	This has to be his ultimate.
34953960	34955960	This has to be the ultimate.
34956960	34958960	There is nothing more he can do.
34958960	34960960	That's ridiculous.
34963960	34966960	He cannot have another ultimate in him.
34966960	34967960	Oh, but he does.
34967960	34969960	Oh, but he does.
34970960	34972960	He's summoning them at will.
34977960	34981960	Yeah, I don't think I can apply cross to this guy.
34986960	34989960	Okay, let me go up and dodge.
34989960	34991960	Oh, wow, I thought I had that.
34993960	34994960	I thought I had that nailed.
34994960	34995960	Maybe not.
34995960	34997960	Oh, he's still going for me.
34997960	34999960	Shit, sorry, I thought he was gonna change.
35010960	35012960	Seems like cross damage is applied on him.
35012960	35014960	He's just bleeding.
35017960	35019960	Wait, did we tell her?
35020960	35022960	What, he doesn't...
35023960	35025960	That was a good attempt.
35027960	35029960	Can someone give mommy a physical shield?
35029960	35031960	You can do a shield and crossbow.
35037960	35040960	Wait, hold on, I might need to pull it some equipment.
35050960	35053960	It's apparently so, but I don't believe you.
35058960	35060960	I couldn't land full on everything.
35062960	35063960	No, I'm not.
35066960	35069960	I don't seem to think I have a stroke.
35074960	35075960	Mm-hmm.
35079960	35082960	Yeah, crossbow works one-handed down this part.
35083960	35085960	But the EI becomes so weird with the part.
35088960	35090960	Chat, what'd I get from Willy?
35090960	35093960	You eat an entire chicken to yourself?
35093960	35094960	Honestly?
35096960	35098960	Willy's chicken to all of us.
35099960	35100960	I don't think he even...
35100960	35102960	I've never seen him get fucking...
35103960	35105960	I can see him get blood loss.
35105960	35107960	I've never fucking seen him get bloody frostbite.
35107960	35109960	Well, I'll just try anyway.
35110960	35112960	I don't think he can get frostbite.
35113960	35114960	Willy's...
35116960	35118960	There's fire on them.
35120960	35122960	Meteor has...
35123960	35124960	Attack power magic.
35124960	35126960	Is he susceptible to magic?
35127960	35129960	He's like, skinny...
35129960	35131960	He's skinny mainly.
35132960	35135960	And he's magic himself, so why would he?
35138960	35141960	I'm trying my Willy Ricans, I'm trying.
35145960	35147960	I'll look if I have a shield to go.
35147960	35149960	Yeah, crossbow's gonna let the shield go down.
35149960	35151960	I have a shield to go down.
35152960	35154960	Okay, I have a shield, hold on.
35155960	35156960	Maybe a little bit?
35156960	35158960	I'll let him do that one.
35159960	35160960	Uh...
35161960	35162960	Maybe a little bit?
35162960	35163960	I don't know.
35163960	35165960	There's some dirt that we have.
35167960	35169960	Wait, so what happens if I shield?
35172960	35173960	Oh wait.
35173960	35174960	I don't think I'll do that, sorry.
35174960	35176960	I'm just gonna put that one in there.
35180960	35182960	What'd that do?
35184960	35186960	Okay, the Ricans are trying to help.
35186960	35187960	He's not had a shot.
35187960	35188960	Or is everyone...
35188960	35190960	Oh, you've not had a shot.
35192960	35194960	It boosts my damage.
35194960	35195960	Okay.
35196960	35197960	Okay.
35198960	35200960	Honestly, I'm tempted to...
35201960	35203960	Do you have to try this one?
35204960	35206960	I don't think it's gonna work.
35208960	35209960	Radar Arrow is good.
35209960	35211960	Radar Arrow?
35213960	35214960	Radar, yeah.
35217960	35218960	Hi!
35218960	35219960	This is Radar?
35221960	35223960	But, who read that wrong?
35225960	35226960	Radar Arrow is so good.
35226960	35227960	I'm so sorry.
35227960	35229960	I'm losing my ability to read and speak and think
35229960	35231960	and do anything pretty much at the same time.
35232960	35234960	Okay, are we ready?
35236960	35237960	I don't know about the shield.
35237960	35238960	Okay, like that.
35238960	35239960	Wow.
35239960	35241960	I've never used the shield before.
35241960	35242960	I'm gonna be honest.
35242960	35243960	Oh, Radar's Arrow.
35243960	35244960	Oh my God, sorry.
35244960	35246960	You're correct in yourself.
35246960	35248960	Right, let him come in.
35249960	35251960	Oh, I was fartily on the pause there.
35256960	35257960	Uh...
35259960	35260960	What the fuck?
35261960	35264960	Wait, I can't rapid fire over the crossbow now.
35265960	35267960	Uh, I mean, I guess.
35270960	35273960	Oh, this guy is not getting around.
35275960	35276960	How about I stop?
35279960	35280960	Another lie.
35280960	35282960	That kinda hurt.
35282960	35283960	That kinda hurt kinda.
35285960	35287960	Oh, I'm getting things off.
35287960	35288960	Oh, blue crab.
35292960	35293960	Yeah, I'm healed up.
35302960	35303960	Fuck me.
35303960	35305960	I don't know how to manage that one.
35305960	35306960	Oh, wait, sorry.
35309960	35310960	Flash me.
35315960	35319960	The only reason I'm putting that away for now is to fucking...
35321960	35322960	Oh, shit.
35325960	35326960	I missed everything.
35326960	35327960	Okay.
35334960	35335960	Ah.
35343960	35345960	I don't know what to do.
35346960	35348960	Got hurt, weaselings.
35350960	35351960	I think mommy's all it is.
35351960	35352960	Stop fucking with me.
35352960	35354960	She about lasted me again.
35356960	35357960	Oh.
35362960	35363960	Oh, shit.
35366960	35367960	Wait.
35370960	35372960	Wait, we tried to miss.
35372960	35375960	You have to buy them, but they're only good to go with.
35379960	35382960	Wow, is there any way we can explore, maybe?
35387960	35389960	Maybe we go explore instead.
35389960	35391960	There was that weird bit down here.
35391960	35392960	This!
35392960	35393960	I wanna...
35393960	35396960	I see purple on the map, so I'm gonna go down here.
35396960	35397960	How do I go down here?
35398960	35399960	I can't remember.
35399960	35401960	I don't think there's a safe safe here.
35401960	35402960	I don't know.
35402960	35403960	Oh.
35404960	35405960	I discovered all of that.
35405960	35407960	I think they need it.
35408960	35409960	Um...
35413960	35415960	Am I gonna go down this way?
35417960	35418960	It looks like there's a little path.
35418960	35420960	If I somehow make my way down there,
35420960	35422960	if I somehow go there...
35422960	35423960	Why not really?
35424960	35425960	There's some.
35425960	35427960	I hide in a clutch shield that needs strength.
35427960	35428960	Do you want it?
35428960	35430960	I don't know if I'm gonna use shields.
35430960	35432960	I'm absolutely married with them.
35432960	35434960	Or does it just boost my defense overall?
35434960	35436960	Like, I don't have to do anything special with them.
35437960	35438960	Or, like...
35438960	35440960	I've never parried an attack.
35440960	35442960	That's what I'm trying to say.
35442960	35444960	I've never parried an attack.
35444960	35445960	So...
35448960	35449960	I'll tell you what.
35449960	35451960	I might go here,
35451960	35454960	and then raid my wee horse all the way up this river,
35454960	35456960	and see what's going on over here.
35463960	35465960	There's a ladder you have to get down there.
35465960	35467960	It's on the bridge before the storehouse.
35472960	35474960	There's a secret coffin in the castle
35474960	35476960	that fast travels through to the desert.
35477960	35479960	The castle we've already cleared.
35481960	35484960	Go to storehouse first.
35486960	35487960	Do you think?
35487960	35488960	One second.
35489960	35490960	Oh, alright.
35493960	35494960	Wait, horse.
35495960	35496960	First floor.
35498960	35499960	Storehouse first floor.
35499960	35501960	I don't know if I can call you guys in there.
35503960	35506960	I don't know if I can tell you in there.
35507960	35508960	I'm sure I can.
35511960	35513960	Like, fucking God, I can.
35514960	35516960	I don't want to be undone the Samoan.
35516960	35518960	I don't want to be undone the Samoan.
35519960	35523960	Okay, we're in storehouse first floor.
35524960	35526960	And you guys are going to get...
35535960	35536960	Samoan.
35538960	35539960	Is that you?
35541960	35542960	That's you.
35542960	35544960	Okay, okay, it's you.
35544960	35545960	Hold on.
35545960	35547960	There's a coffin in the storehouse.
35550960	35552960	I think it might be your turn.
35553960	35554960	I don't know.
35556960	35558960	How are you making even more noise?
35562960	35563960	I think.
35565960	35568960	I'm so sorry, I can't remember the order anymore.
35574960	35576960	Puddlefish and asparagus.
35576960	35577960	Wait.
35578960	35580960	Is that a South Park?
35581960	35582960	What do you want me to eat?
35583960	35586960	Puddlefish and asparagus or something like that?
35590960	35591960	Are we ready?
35591960	35593960	Hello, thank you for coming to my service.
35593960	35596960	Okay, let me put my sword on.
35596960	35600960	Sit wet all over the house with sword if you're not sure.
35606960	35608960	Okay, let's go.
35609960	35612960	I'm on my way.
35612960	35616960	Sit wet all over the house with sword if you're not sure.
35618960	35621960	Sit wet all over the house with sword if you're not sure.
35621960	35623960	Why is he keeping that?
35624960	35626960	Okay, you perish.
35626960	35627960	We're not having anything.
35627960	35629960	Get your poise out of here.
35629960	35631960	Let's not pretend you didn't have any poise.
35632960	35633960	Break him.
35633960	35635960	Break this man.
35636960	35638960	Okay, I'm out of stamina.
35638960	35640960	We're going to break him now.
35654960	35657960	Whoa, get in jump with the reef.
35660960	35662960	Get in jump with the reef.
35662960	35664960	Get in the reef.
35669960	35671960	Okay, they don't have much.
35671960	35674960	Like hold the rope.
35674960	35676960	Still a rip pickle.
35676960	35678960	Check and see if we can move.
35679960	35681960	We man ready to jump me go.
35688960	35690960	Oh shit.
35690960	35691960	Whoa, why?
35691960	35693960	God, he's actually so small.
35693960	35695960	I can't even hit him.
35704960	35706960	I wish I had that helmet.
35709960	35711960	Don't fall in the water.
35713960	35715960	Careful when you put a light on.
35715960	35718960	If you darken this cistern.
35719960	35722960	You don't need to get that hat.
35725960	35727960	Oh my god, this is so fun.
35727960	35730960	You should make a game about going deeper into the earth.
35730960	35732960	And you just get to slide around and stuff.
35732960	35734960	Oh, picture.
35734960	35735960	What do you do?
35735960	35737960	Hello, Mr. Picture.
35737960	35739960	Domain of dragons painting.
35741960	35742960	Curious.
35742960	35744960	Fake wall.
35745960	35747960	I'm just so good at it.
35749960	35751960	Could you guys see that that was open?
35751960	35753960	Because you've already been here before?
35753960	35756960	I'm just checking there's nothing behind us.
35756960	35758960	I don't trust this game.
35758960	35760960	Oh, we do the coffin again.
35760960	35763960	Oh my god, it's the coffin of Ali, Andy and Lily.
35763960	35765960	The hit tool.
35765960	35766960	Wait.
35766960	35769960	Oh, it doesn't let me interact when you guys are here.
35770960	35773960	I was going to say let's all fit in at the same time.
35774960	35776960	And whatever happens, pass it.
35777960	35779960	But we can't open it.
35783960	35785960	Oh, I've got a little mantat.
35786960	35788960	Rest in the coffin.
35788960	35791960	The one bit of sleep I've had this entire journey.
35792960	35795960	I did enjoy it in the game though.
35795960	35807960	I assume the tarnish knew it was going to fall and the tarnish wasn't just like,
35807960	35809960	oh, I'm going for the wee nap, right?
35809960	35810960	Surely.
35812960	35818960	Surely the tarnish knew it was going to fall down and not just be like, oh, where am I?
35819960	35822960	I mean, I'm probably that daft, but...
35826960	35831960	Let's start some.
35831960	35833960	See him a mile off.
35833960	35835960	I don't exactly what the model does.
35839960	35840960	Yeah, I know they've returned to their world.
35840960	35842960	You boot them out, you twats.
35842960	35844960	All right, there's a suit thing here.
35849960	35850960	Wow.
35851960	35853960	Wait, I'm heavy rolling.
35853960	35854960	What did I change?
35855960	35856960	Wait, am I going crazy?
35856960	35858960	Why am I heavy rolling?
35859960	35860960	Oh, because of the shield.
35860960	35861960	Get that one.
35861960	35862960	Get that shield.
35863960	35864960	Okay, there we go.
35866960	35869960	Wait, I can't come on the new area.
35872960	35874960	What do you just mean to do?
35874960	35876960	Oh, we're right in front of the thing!
35878960	35881960	We try to make it if there's an enemy over there.
35882960	35884960	Well, let me put a finger down here.
35885960	35890960	Put a finger down if you sucked my boyfriend out at the back of Denny's or whatever that
35890960	35892960	by room was, I can't remember.
35896960	35900960	I have just discovered what the boss fate is here.
35911960	35916960	Um, this...
35918960	35923960	I mean, can I scoot past and get to a safe point under his crotch?
35936960	35939960	Oh, look, it's like that fire giant destroyed.
35941960	35943960	Oh, sorry, I thought that was where to go.
35943960	35945960	I promise I'm not just being a weirdo.
35945960	35947960	I genuinely thought that was where I was supposed to go.
35948960	35952960	A furnace visage, which means fire face.
35952960	35954960	A visage just means face in French.
35965960	35967960	I can hear a few cries.
35967960	35972960	I don't know why they're crying though.
35972960	35975960	I'll give them something to cry about.
35976960	35978960	Something's attacking me.
35984960	35986960	Something's stomping about.
35990960	35993960	And a cave? Oh, is it dragons up there that are fighting?
35997960	35999960	Oh!
36001960	36003960	What was that?
36008960	36010960	I don't know what that was.
36012960	36016960	Sorry, I got such afraid. I'm sorry if I scared anyone in that.
36016960	36028960	There's savings like that building?
36035960	36037960	I will give you something to cry about.
36037960	36039960	It's just like my mama.
36040960	36042960	Oh, there's another...
36043960	36045960	Give me that. Fuck out of this area.
36045960	36047960	How'd I get out? I'll just go straight down.
36047960	36048960	Bye!
36048960	36051960	It was lovely visiting. No, really, it was.
36051960	36053960	I had a fantastic time.
36053960	36057960	It was gorgeous. Scenery 10 out of 10 would recommend for a tourist spot.
36057960	36059960	Do not mind at all.
36059960	36062960	You were literally submerged in water.
36062960	36063960	You're not telling me.
36063960	36068960	You're like Charimander, sorry, but as soon as you're retail, doesn't it work?
36068960	36070960	You know, your clogs are popped.
36070960	36073960	I didn't make the rules, mate. I didn't make the rules.
36078960	36080960	I still can't summon you guys.
36083960	36085960	Me when I can't follow you.
36086960	36090960	And so that Ryan Gosling meme where he's got his like hand or fist or whatever.
36092960	36096960	And then put my wee hair on it and just feel like when...
36096960	36101960	...Strony can't spawn in the reefing to carry her through every single game ever.
36102960	36104960	Through every single game she ever plays.
36106960	36108960	Where are you from, okay?
36112960	36113960	Yeah.
36114960	36116960	I'm sort of a weird, creepy boo.
36118960	36120960	Come on. Am I just exploring the reefing?
36120960	36123960	What am I doing? I don't actually know if I'm achieving anything.
36123960	36125960	I'm mucking around here.
36127960	36128960	What the?
36130960	36133960	Mercy when she plays a fucking third-person game.
36133960	36135960	Right, she was such a good spot. Holy crap.
36135960	36137960	I'm glad she wasn't sick though.
36137960	36141960	If you didn't know, I played an untitled duck game.
36142960	36144960	A goose game with a mercy.
36145960	36151960	But she has severe motion sickness and the camera angle would not stop twisting.
36151960	36152960	It was such a shame.
36152960	36154960	We almost finished it.
36154960	36159960	But she did this burp and you could tell it was an ono kind of burp.
36162960	36164960	That was definitely an ono.
36166960	36171960	Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit, sit, sit, sit.
36171960	36173960	I'm getting fucking...
36173960	36176960	I'm actually gonna die. I'm ironically gonna die.
36176960	36178960	Why can I not sit down?
36178960	36181960	Because there's fucking enemy... I'm actually gonna die.
36183960	36186960	I'm actually gonna die because I'm so bad at this game.
36186960	36187960	Sit down.
36187960	36189960	You have to be kidding me.
36190960	36192960	Oh my god.
36194960	36196960	Don't ever.
36197960	36199960	Right, what we're doing here?
36199960	36203960	I don't know what we're doing here, but I'm just happy you guys can come.
36203960	36204960	Oh my god.
36204960	36207960	I'm already sitting, literally.
36207960	36212960	Sean is gonna be at the store and get into an awkward position and try to summon some reflin to help her.
36212960	36216960	I'm actually not that awkward in person.
36219960	36223960	So because I have an accent, people actually strike up a lot of caught...
36223960	36225960	Wait, is this a reflin?
36225960	36226960	That was a reflin, right?
36226960	36227960	It wasn't an MPC.
36228960	36232960	Sorry, we're at a place called Reclusus River Dunstrin.
36233960	36235960	Oh there you guys are.
36235960	36237960	Who hasn't been in...
36237960	36240960	Yeah, you've only recently came on, I think.
36241960	36242960	I'm not sure.
36242960	36243960	I'm so sorry.
36243960	36244960	Again, I'm sorry.
36245960	36246960	I've had naysleep.
36246960	36247960	I've had about what?
36249960	36251960	Five hours of sleep?
36251960	36253960	No, not even five hours.
36255960	36259960	I'm being a cheeky cheekerton, doing back-to-back Elden Ring because I want to.
36260960	36261960	Like, I wasn't...
36261960	36263960	Yesterday, I was like...
36263960	36265960	I don't feel stressed when I stream.
36265960	36266960	I feel so happy.
36266960	36268960	I don't have to worry.
36268960	36270960	Or anything.
36270960	36271960	Or on stream.
36271960	36273960	As soon as I click offline, it's like...
36273960	36275960	Oh my god.
36275960	36277960	Is there any enemy reflin?
36277960	36278960	Oh sorry.
36278960	36280960	Obviously better tonight.
36280960	36287960	I suspect I am most likely gonna do what's called a crash.
36287960	36289960	And I'm gonna get all my flops in.
36290960	36292960	Oh, can I not get an enemy reflin here?
36292960	36293960	Oh, I can, I can.
36293960	36294960	I heard it, I heard it.
36294960	36295960	Who's not been in...
36295960	36297960	Norm, I think...
36297960	36299960	Is it Norm?
36301960	36303960	Oh no, I can't remember.
36303960	36306960	Norm, did I have you in recent life?
36306960	36308960	Oh, I can't remember.
36310960	36312960	I like the path in here.
36312960	36315960	It's fun that enemy reflin is most of the time the torch car.
36315960	36317960	It literally tells me where I go.
36317960	36319960	I'm happy when you stream.
36319960	36320960	Yeah, it feels good, man.
36320960	36321960	Five hours is no sleep.
36321960	36323960	I've been average 4.5.
36323960	36326960	That must be an insomnia diagnosis.
36326960	36328960	Because there's no way...
36328960	36331960	If you have insomnia diagnosis, that's different.
36331960	36334960	I normally have 10 hours sleep.
36334960	36338960	Unfortunately, I have not been getting that, but...
36338960	36339960	Let's just go.
36339960	36341960	Meh, weh, weh, weh.
36341960	36342960	Boo-hoo.
36342960	36344960	Can't get 10 hours sleep.
36344960	36345960	I'm fine.
36346960	36347960	Oh, wait, no.
36347960	36350960	I thought that was a reflin that just went flying there.
36353960	36354960	Okay.
36354960	36355960	Nice and slowly.
36355960	36357960	Easy does it now.
36357960	36359960	Easy does it.
36359960	36361960	No one's trying to be a hero.
36361960	36363960	We don't need a speedrun.
36363960	36365960	Nice and easy.
36370960	36371960	Nice and easy.
36371960	36373960	Hey, kiddies!
36373960	36375960	Man, mosquitoes.
36375960	36378960	I've never fricking had problems with mosquitoes.
36378960	36382960	Because there's no such thing as a mosquito in Scotland.
36382960	36384960	They don't even...
36384960	36387960	They can't handle the climate.
36387960	36388960	Alright, let's just move on.
36388960	36390960	This thing going fucks up.
36392960	36394960	I'm irresponsible sleepers,
36394960	36397960	so I usually get sick the most every night and weekend.
36397960	36400960	I'm so jealous of people that...
36401960	36403960	Oh, Jean, that lets them get by with two...
36403960	36405960	Oh, well, it's really bad for their health,
36405960	36407960	even if they don't feel it.
36409960	36411960	Dry leaf roll.
36411960	36413960	Oh, what does that look like?
36414960	36417960	I assume it's all going to be worse for me.
36418960	36421960	Oh, I'm going to look like Melinda.
36424960	36427960	Me, listening to the reflin spite in the background.
36430960	36432960	What got me?
36432960	36435960	Oh, these biggest slugs have so much HP.
36435960	36436960	Hold on.
36436960	36437960	Right, let's move on.
36437960	36438960	Sorry, let's move on.
36438960	36439960	Let's get out of here.
36439960	36441960	The slugs are too much.
36441960	36442960	The slugs are too much.
36442960	36443960	That's too much HP.
36445960	36447960	I'll change my weapon a second.
36448960	36451960	Oh, look like the oogie-boogie man.
36452960	36453960	Oh, I missed.
36454960	36455960	Wait, don't disappear, Mr. Beetle.
36455960	36456960	I need you.
36456960	36457960	Stop it.
36457960	36458960	I need you, Mr. Beetle.
36459960	36461960	Oh, I'm not that handy.
36462960	36464960	Oh, somber something.
36466960	36467960	Okay.
36467960	36469960	Once we're out of here, I'll change my outfit back,
36469960	36473960	because this is not quite what I'm looking for.
36473960	36475960	That looks pretty cool, though.
36476960	36478960	That looks exactly like one of them.
36482960	36484960	There's no such thing as a Miss Ketwin Scotland.
36484960	36486960	This reflin looks in Louisiana.
36486960	36488960	It's going to be bumped up on the list.
36488960	36489960	Of reflings to import?
36489960	36491960	That's hilarious.
36494960	36497960	I wonder if you've got enough bones to bump your sword to ten.
36497960	36498960	I probably could.
36498960	36499960	Oh, okay.
36499960	36500960	It's a boat.
36500960	36501960	Hold on.
36501960	36502960	Let me put my good stuff back on.
36504960	36509960	I was a lion's head with armor.
36509960	36511960	That scares me.
36512960	36514960	I don't know what's ahead.
36514960	36515960	You're freaking me out, right?
36515960	36517960	I'm doing a medium roll.
36517960	36518960	Let's go.
36518960	36520960	Oh, I can't get past her.
36520960	36524960	Okay, let's see what's behind door number one.
36524960	36527960	Okay, it's a crypt fight.
36527960	36531960	Okay, it's a skinny blood katana.
36531960	36548960	But when I'm on skinny blood katana, I do a tiddlywinker damage.
36555960	36557960	I do a wee tiddlywinkle.
36557960	36561960	Is that a button?
36564960	36566960	A fucking tiddlywink, honestly.
36566960	36570960	Right, I don't need fire resistance at the moment.
36570960	36573960	Just give me a stamina, I guess, one more.
36579960	36581960	There's a refling on standby.
36582960	36587960	I can't believe you would underestimate the skinny.
36587960	36593960	Honestly, I saw the long katana and I was like, okay, skinny bleed build, bruv.
36593960	36598960	They were not kidding when they were like, ah, by the way, this game's a wee bit harder.
36598960	36601960	Did I just have you both then?
36601960	36602960	Norm?
36605960	36607960	Look at me.
36608960	36611960	Sorry, I'm just going to push right now.
36611960	36615960	I hope the boss doesn't have poise, damn straight.
36615960	36617960	You better not.
36619960	36621960	Okay, here's the thunder.
36624960	36626960	Are you ready?
36626960	36628960	Are you steady?
36628960	36629960	Oh jeez.
36629960	36630960	Good luck.
36630960	36634960	See, that charm, that was actually me, that wasn't the thing.
36634960	36638960	Okay, let's try that again, the same as the apps again, bloateroo, the upgrade.
36640960	36641960	Hold on.
36642960	36643960	What's the plan?
36643960	36644960	What's the plan?
36644960	36645960	Abracadabra.
36645960	36646960	Swinging.
36646960	36648960	You're allowed to swing.
36648960	36651960	I'd rather you didn't, but that is the bit.
36652960	36653960	Poise.
36656960	36658960	Refling, no.
36660960	36662960	Okay, the poise is breakable.
36662960	36665960	I think we all need to go in heavy, but I'm out of fricking...
36667960	36669960	I'm out of stamina, holy crap.
36672960	36675960	I'm like completely out of stamina when I'm trying to...
36682960	36683960	Oh, at least.
36684960	36685960	Okay.
36685960	36689960	Hardly any poise, which is good, but I need to back off because I'm out.
36691960	36693960	I need to back off because I'm out.
36695960	36698960	I need to recover the stamina.
36702960	36706960	Alright, so when I slam down any other time, she gets close chance,
36706960	36709960	but when I do it that one time, she doesn't aim right, okay.
36709960	36711960	Better scratch her a minch and fucking take a sniff
36711960	36714960	because she's got bigger fish to fry than fucking me, hen.
36716960	36717960	Raging.
36717960	36718960	Actual raging.
36719960	36722960	I'm too tired to have my angry voice on me.
36723960	36726960	I'm too tired to have my angry voice on me.
36729960	36731960	Okay, are we got heavies?
36732960	36734960	Okay, I need you to back off.
36735960	36737960	Okay, are we got heavies?
36738960	36740960	Okay, I need you to be heavy.
36742960	36745960	That was a good try, though, now. Like, we're 100% gold.
36745960	36747960	I'm just fucking being straight, so...
36748960	36751960	We don't really have many cork brooches in most places in Scotland, either.
36753960	36757960	Yeah, I've never actually seen a cork brooch in Silicon to Australia.
36758960	36759960	Not fun.
36760960	36763960	That Scottish trash talk was actually kind of crazy.
36764960	36767960	Literally, she's got a badly packed kebab, fucking axe wound looking ass.
36767960	36769960	Honestly, it's trailing halfway out the door, hen.
36772960	36775960	If she jumps up and down, her fanny flaps clap.
36775960	36777960	Like, fuck off, honestly.
36780960	36782960	Okay, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's do it again.
36782960	36783960	Let's do it.
36784960	36785960	Let's do it.
36790960	36792960	Alright, I have points. Fuck your points.
36792960	36793960	You're shit.
36793960	36795960	We're just fucking going for it.
36800960	36801960	No, I need...
36810960	36814960	And don't get me started about your family tree. It's a fucking circle, mate.
36815960	36816960	That doesn't make any sense.
36817960	36818960	Maybe it does.
36819960	36820960	No, wait.
36821960	36823960	Why is it your family tree looks like a...
36824960	36826960	Is it? Your family tree looks like a circle?
36827960	36828960	If it's all been...
36830960	36832960	Hey, that's what I meant. That's what I meant.
36833960	36834960	And...
36838960	36839960	And I'm...
36842960	36845960	Did I not just summon you, or am I getting memory loss now?
36846960	36848960	I think I'm starting to get memory loss.
36849960	36851960	Oh, your family tree is a fucking reef.
36851960	36852960	Ah, that's what it is.
36857960	36858960	Someone put some...
36863960	36864960	You're found.
36865960	36866960	I'm dead.
36871960	36872960	Alright, let's try it again.
36872960	36874960	Alright, how about we... We've got our own fucking...
36874960	36876960	Weakening Kitana, but we...
36876960	36877960	Like, don't you mind those?
36878960	36879960	Okay, you're blessing yourself.
36879960	36880960	That's fine. You're allowed to bless yourself.
36887960	36888960	Fuck you. No poise.
36888960	36889960	No talent.
36889960	36890960	No skill.
36890960	36891960	Shit.
36891960	36892960	Masterful blade.
36892960	36893960	Bastard.
36893960	36894960	Honestly.
36896960	36897960	No way!
36898960	36901960	Okay, I think I'm gonna try and upgrade this sword next.
36901960	36902960	Cause...
36902960	36904960	I think I have what I need for it.
36907960	36908960	Oh my god, I'll...
36910960	36912960	I literally cannot be hit twice.
36912960	36913960	That's insane.
36922960	36925960	I literally cannot be hit twice in a row, or I'm gone.
36927960	36929960	No way she has heals!
36929960	36931960	That's against the fucking rules!
36935960	36937960	Alright, I need back walls on boots.
36942960	36943960	Okay, hold on.
36947960	36949960	Fucking get cornered, honestly.
36950960	36951960	Ah!
36956960	36958960	Ah, as if she's healing.
36959960	36961960	Is that even a heal, you really?
36964960	36966960	Ah, I'm out of stamina. I'm gone.
36966960	36968960	I don't even think I can dodge.
36969960	36972960	I can hardly even dodge to heal!
36973960	36974960	Fuck me, man.
36976960	36978960	I need to heal!
36979960	36980960	I need to heal!
36985960	36987960	So when I jump, she hit...
36987960	36990960	Oh, cause she's bloody faster than me by a pixel.
37001960	37002960	Good news.
37003960	37006960	Strongly, my sister is pregnant. I'm gonna be the father.
37010960	37012960	No, no, you're not supposed to do that part.
37012960	37014960	That part isn't supposed to happen.
37016960	37018960	He cleaned us up with an ash of war.
37019960	37023960	When he does the stomp, he goes into super armor and can't be staggered.
37023960	37024960	Is that what it is?
37025960	37027960	You've not had a shot.
37028960	37030960	I placed my Sane, but I don't know...
37030960	37032960	I don't even think it's a Sane.
37033960	37036960	Have you had a shot? If you've not had a shot, I think...
37036960	37038960	Okay, these guys have had a shot.
37039960	37042960	I know we can do it like sauce. We can like a hundred percent do this.
37042960	37045960	Are you telling me like we can take down like incredibly massive bosses
37045960	37049960	and this wee skinny rat sitting in a fucking cat comb,
37049960	37054960	like a somewhat weird and festive little scurry and about.
37054960	37057960	We can't deal with that. No, sorry, I don't believe it.
37057960	37058960	I don't believe it.
37059960	37060960	I didn't believe it.
37064960	37065960	Let's try again.
37066960	37068960	I just have had more infinite stamina.
37068960	37070960	Honestly, I'm like, if I shove it all in your...
37070960	37072960	Do you use the light snows? Okay, we've been blessed.
37078960	37080960	Mate, you... fuck you.
37080960	37081960	I missed.
37084960	37086960	I missed horribly wrong.
37086960	37088960	I'm actually really wrong.
37094960	37097960	Careful of whatever her freaking Ash of War is,
37097960	37100960	so don't all get too close or else we're all gonna get walloped.
37100960	37103960	Oh, that was a good one. I like that. Do that again.
37113960	37115960	I'm actually gonna still heal because I don't trust it.
37116960	37118960	How does that man...
37118960	37122960	Holy shit, I don't know what you're doing, but yeah, damn.
37125960	37127960	I'm gonna make sure I'm full health because I do not trust.
37132960	37134960	Neatly...
37134960	37135960	I don't know about stamina.
37146960	37147960	I don't know.
37163960	37166960	Sorry, I'm very low stamina. I'm trying.
37168960	37171960	Fucking not regenerating because I'm jumping about the place.
37171960	37173960	Like a kangaroo.
37173960	37176960	Oh, that was bloody good timing that.
37178960	37180960	I'm worried about her sword art. I don't know when she does it.
37180960	37182960	Like, I'm getting nervous.
37183960	37186960	Oh my god, you're like fucking nothing at all about the thing.
37186960	37188960	That's actually kind of funny.
37188960	37191960	She's like just trying to get one looking.
37191960	37193960	I hope I make back off the wall.
37193960	37206960	Okay, she's out of heals. She's just showing us she's out of heals.
37212960	37214960	I don't know how I did that one, but I'll take it.
37214960	37215960	I'm young.
37223960	37224960	Nice.
37237960	37241960	Okay, I need to back off the wall because it's not gonna fucking hit if I'm against the wall.
37241960	37245960	That candlestick is unironically the candlestick is in the way.
37247960	37251960	Dude, I was gonna jump and attack, but who's gonna win?
37251960	37253960	Oh, I knew we could do it.
37255960	37256960	Thank you.
37260960	37262960	Did we even get anything to that?
37264960	37267960	Oh, we got armor. Holy crap. What kind of armor?
37268960	37269960	Check it out.
37270960	37271960	Shit.
37275960	37279960	Is it like a lay armor? It must be samurai armor, I guess.
37282960	37284960	I mean, I guess.
37285960	37289960	You took two turns to smash her? Yeah.
37290960	37293960	See, Kenneth is like actually mildly fair.
37293960	37296960	Then it's like, yeah, I'll put my time until like actually dodging and shit.
37296960	37303960	But Ken, when it's just like, or you need to like hack a billion diamonds, it's like, bro, you only got time for that.
37303960	37304960	Oh, okay.
37309960	37311960	I'm literally getting the more benefit than this.
37311960	37313960	Right, so we're done.
37314960	37317960	Is there more? No, wait, there's a giant out there.
37321960	37324960	Oh no, I have eye strain in my left eye. Are you kidding me?
37327960	37329960	Sorry, I'm looking around right now.
37329960	37331960	I have left strain in my left eye for some-
37331960	37334960	It left strain. I have eye strain in my left eye for something.
37335960	37337960	Are you joking me? Come on.
37337960	37340960	Where is it? Where are they? Oh, come on. We've only got one fucking hour left.
37340960	37342960	I'm just gonna relax.
37342960	37344960	I need to put a little plaster on my eye.
37345960	37346960	I need to do a mercy. Hold on.
37356960	37358960	When you soap the boss like that, it's kind of hot.
37359960	37360960	Okay, angry.
37366960	37368960	Oh, I just got all of them.
37369960	37372960	Right, so that was something.
37373960	37375960	Where else did you check in?
37377960	37379960	Okay, that was that, but I couldn't summon you guys in.
37379960	37387960	I assume if I summon you in here, there's no way the game's gonna let his wolf all the way to that giant to try and get the giant?
37404960	37406960	You ever wish you could like fake angry?
37406960	37409960	I feel like there's a word for it too, but I'm too interested in-
37413960	37415960	Like be an actual angry person?
37419960	37422960	I think it's just within your personality, I guess.
37425960	37433960	I always grew up like, you know, you're polite, you're quiet, you keep to yourself, like that kind of thing.
37433960	37436960	Can't summon us anywhere near there.
37436960	37439960	Oh, bro, why would they give such a big fight then?
37440960	37441960	The game's so rude, right?
37441960	37446960	I'm just gonna go here and then take my- oh no, the horse doesn't go up there, it in.
37451960	37453960	The best I can do is the water.
37454960	37457960	No, it's kind of- I think I'm stuck.
37458960	37460960	Recruits?
37461960	37463960	River downstream grade.
37464960	37466960	Someone take her behind the cat.
37468960	37472960	Well, act angry if they're actually being angry to get whole angry thoughts in.
37472960	37473960	Oh!
37474960	37475960	Act in it, yeah.
37476960	37478960	She says it's her voice size.
37479960	37484960	Um, yeah, like, no, I can like, if you want to give me a sentence, I'll try my best to say it.
37484960	37489960	I might be cringe because I'm exhausted right now, but yeah, I can definitely act angry.
37489960	37491960	Like, oh, I'm fucking reasonable.
37491960	37499960	It sounds so sarcastic because, like, it's not me saying it right now, but you know.
37499960	37503960	If you want to take the map, you have to go to the ruins of the North.
37509960	37514960	I'm taking what holds the benefit of low-energy angry mummy.
37514960	37516960	I'm at your region.
37517960	37519960	You will be looking after yourself.
37520960	37525960	I'm not even at the point of anger where I'm shouting at you, Reefling.
37525960	37533960	I'm at the point of disappointed anger where I have told you over and over again to look after yourself.
37533960	37541960	And yet, you keep coming back to me and you keep explaining to me that you don't feel well and something's not working out.
37541960	37545960	Like, that's probably emotionless as a tag for a reason.
37545960	37548960	Oh, I can definitely do emotionless right now, so I'm exhausted.
37548960	37549960	Sorry.
37549960	37552960	There's a boss in Six Sacred Fragments behind the castle.
37552960	37554960	This castle?
37554960	37555960	No, that's a room.
37556960	37558960	The shadowy castle?
37564960	37565960	Mmm.
37568960	37571960	Yeah, probably do emotionless right now.
37571960	37574960	Having someone disappointed at you is so much worse than just being angry.
37574960	37576960	Bro, tell me about it.
37576960	37586960	When I started my job at my cafe, I accidentally left a bin's out, but I didn't close them.
37586960	37591960	And Seagull's fucking ripped the bag open in the back door.
37592960	37595960	And my boss was like, strongy.
37595960	37596960	I'm not mad.
37596960	37599960	I'm just disappointed because you knew better.
37599960	37601960	And I was like, I'm so sorry.
37601960	37603960	Like, I completely forgot.
37603960	37606960	Somehow disappointed anger is way worse.
37606960	37610960	I thought I'd try my best to take you back to yourself, but when you're disappointed in me...
37612960	37614960	When she's not angry, she's disappointed.
37614960	37615960	Yeah, shadow keep.
37615960	37617960	There's a wall in the store room you can go through.
37617960	37619960	Shadow keep.
37619960	37621960	Shhh, shhh, shhh, shadow keep.
37621960	37625960	There's a wall in the store room you can go through.
37625960	37628960	Maybe for score, high, high, high, high, high, high, high.
37629960	37631960	Strongy, you just perfectly imitated my mom.
37631960	37632960	That was funny.
37632960	37633960	It's probably uncomfortable.
37634960	37635960	Hello, strongy.
37635960	37636960	Hello, cha.
37636960	37637960	Hello.
37637960	37638960	How's it going?
37639960	37640960	I'm very low energy.
37640960	37644960	We're just talking about how I can be like a scorny mother, basically.
37644960	37648960	But instead of being angry because I'm like low energy,
37648960	37651960	I just sound like a disappointed mum.
37651960	37653960	So how's force floor?
37653960	37655960	I would guide you, but I'm not.
37655960	37656960	Oh, I'm no home right now.
37656960	37659960	Oh, does anyone know what he wants me to do?
37662960	37667960	Maybe if we do some exploring, we'll find a way.
37668960	37672960	If you want to go out to get that boss, you need to go to the sun center.
37673960	37675960	I'll sink your church.
37676960	37677960	I'll be your church.
37677960	37679960	You can sink in my church.
37681960	37685960	If you want to go to that boss, you need to go to the sun center.
37685960	37686960	Wait, this one?
37686960	37687960	No, wait.
37687960	37688960	The ruins of...
37692960	37693960	I know, I'm sorry.
37693960	37695960	Or is this the sun center?
37695960	37697960	Or is this the red...
37697960	37700960	No, this is a fucking castle.
37707960	37713960	Shadooke, shadooke, shadooke, there's a shadooke,
37713960	37719960	There's a shadooke, shadooke, shadooke, shadooke, shadooke.
37719960	37721960	Shadooke Mingi.
37721960	37730960	Actually, would seagulls be considered our enemies or natural enemies because we're calamari?
37730960	37732960	Thank you.
37732960	37741960	Oh, is this one of them boxed with things where I kind of call you then?
37741960	37751960	Was it this way?
37751960	37756960	If I'm getting it wrong.
37756960	37758960	Bruh!
37758960	37763960	Imma wait for my reference for a freaking millisecond, please!
37763960	37766960	Have some mercy!
37767960	37773960	Go to church district entry gate.
37780960	37783960	I'm so sorry, I don't know this.
37783960	37785960	I can't believe it.
37785960	37794960	Go to church district entry gate.
37794960	37798960	Right, I'm fucking doing a complete wrong place.
37798960	37802960	See, this is what you have to put up with when you're a streamer.
37802960	37807960	Church district high road.
37807960	37811960	Church district entrance.
37811960	37813960	Sunken chapel.
37813960	37816960	Do you want me in the end?
37816960	37819960	I'm so sorry, I'm absolutely losing the floor.
37819960	37822960	I'm sure I'll wake up tomorrow and I'll be completely on board.
37822960	37824960	Exactly what to do for right now.
37824960	37827960	Oh, you want me to go to sunken chapel?
37827960	37828960	Sorry.
37828960	37829960	Sorry?
37829960	37832960	No, what are we doing in sunken chapel?
37832960	37834960	What will we do with sunken chapel?
37834960	37836960	What will we do with the sunken chapel?
37836960	37840960	What will we do with the sunken chapel early in the morning?
37840960	37844960	He won up, he rises, he won up.
37844960	37847960	I swear to God if you say I can't spawn anyone in.
37847960	37851960	Imma ask for a refund at it and I'm not actually.
37851960	37853960	I'll just be a big girl.
37853960	37855960	Oh, and you can upgrade my sword as well actually.
37855960	37858960	I need to thanks you for saving me.
37858960	37861960	Alright, now that I'm here.
37861960	37865960	There's some sort of exit.
37865960	37867960	Is it?
37867960	37869960	What is this?
37869960	37871960	I don't know what this is.
37871960	37880960	Wait, there's a fucking summoning thing.
37880960	37890960	Strony, when you're in the, if you press Y, you bring up the list of the...
37890960	37896960	Oh my God, that's a good spot.
37896960	37898960	What am I doing here?
37898960	37902960	I don't know.
37902960	37909960	Can you switch that?
37909960	37911960	How many DLC both of you?
37911960	37914960	Have you perished too far too many?
37914960	37918960	I'm absolutely terrified when the reflins can't help me.
37918960	37921960	Come on, you have to tell me there's like an enemy in here.
37921960	37925960	There's no way.
37925960	37927960	Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.
37927960	37929960	No, I don't have my reflins.
37929960	37931960	No.
37931960	37932960	Should I just grab the items?
37932960	37934960	You know, I'm just grabbing the items.
37934960	37935960	No, no, no, no.
37935960	37937960	Can I even grab the items?
37937960	37945960	I can't even grab the room! I'm pillaging the remains! Any pillagers! I'm a pillager! I'm pillaging for sombers with worms!
37945960	37948960	Oh, there's two psalms. Get me out of here.
37948960	37952960	He's too big to fit through these doors. Close the doors. Close the doors behind me.
37952960	37954960	Ring the guards. Ring the guards.
37954960	37956960	Fuck me. Is there enemy?
37956960	37961960	Oh, fuck me! It gets worse! It gets worse! It gets worse! It gets worse!
37961960	37965960	When the reeflings aren't around, it gets even worse!
37966960	37967960	Okay.
37967960	37970960	You should seek to find a safe location.
37973960	37974960	Safe.
37974960	37975960	Safe?
37976960	37978960	Do these doors safe?
37981960	37985960	Okay, safe enough. I can just hide here. Right. What am I doing?
37986960	37990960	In the building with the flaming zombies, there's an elevator if you hug the right.
37990960	37991960	This?
37991960	37993960	Did I find it suspiciously?
37993960	37995960	Did I find it by accident?
37997960	37999960	I think I found it by accident.
37999960	38002960	No, that's not it. Okay, my apologies.
38004960	38007960	Wrong one. It was a 50-50.
38014960	38015960	Woah.
38016960	38018960	I'm so brave. I can do it.
38018960	38023960	Just go dead ahead. Surely just dead ahead and I don't have to think.
38023960	38025960	I don't have to say anyone.
38026960	38028960	Excuse me, pardon me, come through.
38028960	38030960	Excuse me, pardon me, come through!
38032960	38035960	Hug the right? You're not the right. Hug the right?
38035960	38037960	You're a statue. Hug the right?
38037960	38040960	Wait, what the heck? Why are you doing it like that?
38041960	38043960	Hug the right?
38045960	38047960	If you go past them and then to your left.
38049960	38052960	And then there's an elevator to the right.
38069960	38071960	You're right! Oh my god.
38071960	38073960	Oh my god.
38075960	38078960	Safety, safety. We go there in the end.
38082960	38084960	Motherfucker.
38092960	38093960	Fuck!
38094960	38096960	Fuck! I'm actually gonna have to do a fight?
38096960	38098960	Or can I just, like...
38099960	38102960	Can I just run ahead and there's like a thing or something?
38118960	38120960	Just keep running.
38120960	38122960	No button.
38122960	38124960	Shh, shh, shh.
38127960	38131960	If I make a break for that. No, there's an empty wall. There's no jump.
38131960	38133960	There's no fucking jump.
38134960	38136960	You went too far.
38138960	38140960	Shh.
38142960	38144960	There is a red enemy back there.
38145960	38147960	I can handle it. I can handle it.
38152960	38154960	Fuck.
38172960	38174960	I hate gaming on my own.
38174960	38176960	Oh my god, I can't do it. Holy shit.
38176960	38179960	I think I did it. Please no more surprises.
38179960	38182960	I can't handle it. I can't handle any more of that.
38186960	38189960	I knew I could get a damage bonus if I sneak that.
38189960	38191960	Which I'm glad I got it.
38192960	38194960	Oh my god.
38194960	38196960	Is there a safe thing and you guys can come in again?
38196960	38199960	Holy crap, this map. Why is this game so big?
38199960	38200960	Seriously.
38200960	38203960	Normally it's like, oh, why is this game so small?
38203960	38205960	There's not enough content.
38205960	38207960	Look how high, what elevated we are.
38207960	38210960	I cannot imagine the elevation difference.
38215960	38217960	What the fuck am I doing here?
38217960	38219960	Okay, where now?
38221960	38225960	Go left, and what happens when I go left?
38225960	38228960	Then up the ladder. Left and up the ladder.
38229960	38231960	Ladder, ladder, ladder, ladder, ladder, ladder.
38231960	38234960	Oh, the relief.
38234960	38239960	The fucking relief that watches over me seeing this.
38239960	38241960	Oh lord.
38242960	38245960	Oh lord, the relief.
38246960	38248960	Why can't I just have that all the time?
38249960	38252960	Why can't you just give me that all the time?
38252960	38255960	Goodness, gravy. How can he handle that?
38255960	38256960	My wee heart.
38257960	38259960	Oh, literally, an assassin is creeped up here.
38259960	38262960	Do not be detected by any nearby enemies.
38264960	38266960	Is there any other reefling that has this one?
38266960	38269960	It's called the storehouse back section.
38273960	38275960	Oh, don't let it happen again.
38287960	38289960	Oh, there's just moustaches in there.
38289960	38291960	They're back together.
38292960	38294960	Good morning.
38294960	38296960	Wakey, wakey.
38298960	38300960	Dude, lovers.
38300960	38302960	We're bitten from one another.
38302960	38306960	Our people face them.
38309960	38313960	And the mountain debates them apart.
38313960	38315960	I said that wrong.
38317960	38320960	Is there no other reefling that can join in right now?
38320960	38321960	It's okay.
38321960	38323960	If not.
38323960	38325960	Stranny, I don't like seeing you scared,
38325960	38327960	but you're actually giving me one.
38327960	38330960	Damn, it's fucking terrifying.
38330960	38332960	Why is there a mark on this right here?
38332960	38333960	I don't know.
38333960	38335960	My sign is done.
38335960	38336960	I'm not sure where I am.
38336960	38337960	Have you done something?
38337960	38339960	Are you in New Game Plus?
38339960	38341960	Are you in New Game Plus?
38342960	38346960	And the mountain fights them apart.
38348960	38349960	I'll give it.
38349960	38351960	You have 20 more seconds, Mr. Symbol,
38351960	38354960	to show up, or we're claiming that ladder.
38356960	38358960	I'm hunting for the symbol.
38363960	38364960	Do you think?
38364960	38365960	Right, hold on.
38365960	38366960	Let's do this.
38366960	38367960	Oh.
38367960	38372960	You smell like you need food.
38372960	38375960	And I'm the only one that can give you food.
38380960	38381960	What?
38381960	38382960	I got a katana.
38382960	38384960	Well, I don't like her katana.
38388960	38391960	The lift gets a real gunner.
38391960	38392960	Wow.
38395960	38398960	Didn't you want to go to sleep like six hours ago?
38398960	38399960	Maybe.
38399960	38401960	After moaning about a coconut?
38401960	38402960	Oh, right.
38402960	38403960	The moaning coconut.
38403960	38405960	I don't know why I can't see.
38407960	38408960	Oh, is it your turn now?
38408960	38409960	Okay, okay.
38409960	38410960	Hold on.
38410960	38411960	Let's do the test.
38411960	38412960	Hold on to the test.
38415960	38419960	A bit sway, rather pungent, but that'll do.
38421960	38433960	Um, I don't know why I need the symbol to show up, but it's not having it, right?
38433960	38437960	Let's claim these ladders and maybe something a little better.
38437960	38438960	Why is it blue?
38438960	38439960	Why are you blue?
38439960	38440960	Is it any blue?
38440960	38445960	Right, there's one enemy there, but I think he likes it a lot.
38445960	38448960	Wait, do you guys want to go first?
38448960	38450960	Please, gentlemen, first.
38453960	38457960	If the others know the way they can show you that pelvis along the table, demolish.
38457960	38459960	How does she know?
38463960	38465960	Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.
38465960	38467960	Oh, we're still one.
38467960	38468960	Are we still one?
38468960	38469960	Yeah, we are still one.
38469960	38475960	Sorry, I thought it was one of those ones where it's like, it's optional to get off here if you want to grab some weird obscure item that no one knows about.
38475960	38478960	And it does some weird obscure thing that no one knows about.
38484960	38486960	Oh, something's going on up here.
38500960	38502960	Are you not two holding the handle?
38502960	38503960	Oh, it's the handle?
38503960	38506960	Okay, let's go.
38512960	38513960	Oh, stagger.
38514960	38516960	Low toys, don't care.
38516960	38517960	Don't talk to me.
38517960	38518960	Go home.
38518960	38520960	Back to the urge tree to you.
38520960	38521960	What's that?
38521960	38523960	You need a mile lower of the game?
38523960	38524960	Kind of.
38524960	38526960	Sometimes, not on the plane.
38528960	38530960	We can't jump up on that.
38530960	38531960	That's okay.
38532960	38535960	Are you getting ready to slap those two there and all?
38537960	38540960	I'm picking up fire serpent.
38543960	38545960	There is a window there.
38552960	38554960	Is this dangerous?
38556960	38558960	There's a window.
38561960	38562960	MGA?
38562960	38563960	What's MGA?
38563960	38565960	Metal Gear Solid?
38566960	38568960	I've actually never played this series.
38568960	38569960	Is it good?
38569960	38571960	I just thought people memed on it a lot.
38576960	38577960	Here.
38580960	38582960	Okay, I'm not jumping that way.
38584960	38585960	Wait, you'd love it?
38585960	38587960	With the politics in the game?
38587960	38588960	Stop!
38589960	38591960	Would that, actually?
38594960	38596960	You'd love that game, why?
38596960	38597960	Because of the politics.
38597960	38598960	Oh, okay.
38599960	38600960	It's nonstop tinfoil.
38600960	38601960	Stop!
38601960	38603960	Can I put tinfoil hat if you play it?
38604960	38606960	Is there any reefling that can come here?
38607960	38608960	Oh, no.
38608960	38609960	What?
38609960	38610960	Can't even open my map.
38612960	38613960	Oops.
38614960	38615960	I missed my rage.
38615960	38616960	Oh, no.
38616960	38617960	Oh, no.
38617960	38618960	Oh, wait.
38618960	38620960	My other right is there.
38620960	38622960	I don't know why I don't know.
38623960	38625960	You're lucky I caught it that time.
38625960	38628960	And before there's symbol appears back there.
38628960	38630960	I don't think there is one.
38631960	38632960	My lady.
38635960	38637960	Wow, this is big.
38638960	38640960	It's literally about a secret shadow.
38640960	38642960	Shadow government that runs the world.
38642960	38644960	Oh, I like that.
38647960	38649960	I hear something.
38657960	38658960	Gentle, gentle.
38658960	38660960	We need to be careful.
38662960	38665960	Call me a rabbit because I need to be near here.
38670960	38672960	Um, um, um, um, um.
38672960	38674960	Wait, isn't it like that?
38674960	38677960	Um, the magic place and the main map.
38677960	38678960	What do you mean?
38678960	38679960	It's a mildly the same.
38679960	38680960	Okay.
38680960	38682960	Does anyone have long range other than my shitty crossbow?
38682960	38684960	I don't think I count.
38685960	38686960	But I need these guys.
38686960	38689960	These guys are going to like sonic rumors off the damn thing.
38689960	38692960	I need, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
38692960	38694960	There's like, there's an enemy like right there.
38695960	38697960	Where are you going?
38699960	38701960	I don't know why the enemy did that.
38701960	38702960	Are we to turn back?
38703960	38705960	No, there's an enemy over there.
38705960	38706960	How did you do that?
38706960	38707960	Did you jump?
38707960	38708960	Be honest.
38712960	38714960	Oh, I didn't like that.
38714960	38717960	I don't know, but don't let me do that again.
38723960	38727960	Uh, uh, hold on.
38727960	38730960	I need to get this thing.
38733960	38734960	No!
38735960	38737960	Are you fucking serious and getting wall banged?
38737960	38739960	Aren't I ironically getting wall banged?
38741960	38743960	Aren't I ironically getting wall banged?
38743960	38744960	Are you joking?
38744960	38745960	I need...
38746960	38747960	Hi.
38750960	38752960	I'm so sorry, Reflin.
38753960	38754960	Oh.
38756960	38757960	Well, someone's mad.
38758960	38760960	I need to be careful.
38760960	38762960	Oh, they can see me from here.
38762960	38763960	I need to be careful.
38764960	38766960	Oh, Reflin, I don't...
38766960	38768960	That's exactly what I was worried about.
38769960	38771960	That's exactly what I was worried about.
38771960	38772960	Tell you who.
38773960	38775960	No, Reflin, you're in the way.
38775960	38776960	Oh, darling, you're in the way.
38776960	38777960	Careful.
38778960	38780960	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
38780960	38781960	Sorry, darling.
38781960	38783960	You were to just leave at once.
38783960	38785960	You were to just leave at once.
38786960	38789960	I have no idea what this item is, but yeah, damn.
38789960	38791960	It better be worth the heart attack.
38793960	38795960	I'm not sure what you are, darling.
38795960	38796960	What are you?
38797960	38798960	Oh, right.
38798960	38799960	Okay, I'll hold on a minute.
38799960	38801960	Am I still getting wall banged by that wizard?
38801960	38802960	Is he losing at me?
38803960	38804960	Wait, where'd you go?
38805960	38806960	Reflin?
38806960	38808960	Did you go down the ladder?
38808960	38809960	Reflin?
38809960	38810960	Hello?
38810960	38811960	Hello, gay?
38811960	38812960	Reflin?
38812960	38813960	Reflin?
38813960	38814960	Hello?
38814960	38815960	I literally cannot see you.
38815960	38816960	Where are you?
38817960	38819960	You did go down the water, didn't you?
38820960	38821960	What the fuck?
38821960	38822960	Did he despawn?
38823960	38824960	Am I blind?
38824960	38825960	Hold on.
38825960	38826960	I think I'm going schizophrenic.
38826960	38829960	Did I not have a Reflin literally gating me that entire time?
38829960	38830960	Where is he?
38839960	38841960	I can't see you.
38841960	38842960	Whoa!
38843960	38844960	They're pissed.
38845960	38846960	Did you see that?
38846960	38848960	God, they're still locked onto me.
38854960	38856960	Okay, I might need to be a bit quick, Reflin,
38856960	38858960	just because I've got that enemy target in me
38858960	38859960	and they can probably...
38859960	38860960	All right, go down.
38860960	38861960	Get in.
38861960	38862960	In, in, in.
38864960	38865960	No, go.
38867960	38869960	You've been alone this entire time.
38871960	38873960	I really do need to pick up my...
38874960	38876960	Wait, the Reflin can spawn here.
38878960	38880960	There must be something weird going on.
38880960	38881960	He was never there, mommy.
38881960	38883960	Don't say such things.
38884960	38886960	That bat, literally that bat was like,
38886960	38888960	now this ain't worth that amount.
38888960	38889960	Have respect.
38889960	38890960	Okay, now that we've done that,
38890960	38892960	what did we achieve?
38892960	38893960	What did we achieve?
38893960	38894960	Was that what I was supposed to do?
38894960	38895960	Did I achieve what I was supposed to do?
38895960	38896960	Huh?
38896960	38897960	Huh?
38897960	38898960	Huh?
38898960	38899960	We achieved.
38899960	38901960	We need to go back up again.
38902960	38903960	I'm beat.
38903960	38905960	Oh, you're getting me back up.
38909960	38912960	The real Reflin where the friends can go down.
38913960	38915960	If they are, real question mark.
38930960	38933960	Oh, yeah.
38933960	38936960	We just did a, like, massive view turn.
38937960	38939960	When we could have done that the whole time
38939960	38941960	and we didn't have to do parkour.
38943960	38945960	Wait, we're going back.
38947960	38949960	Holy shit, they're pissed.
38949960	38951960	They're on the same level right now.
38951960	38952960	The freaking...
38952960	38955960	The witch is literally over there.
38955960	38956960	I'll go.
38957960	38960960	Um, should I cross?
38960960	38961960	Hold on.
38961960	38962960	Hold on.
38962960	38963960	Let's see what happens.
38965960	38966960	Hold on.
38968960	38969960	Oh, wrong one.
38973960	38974960	Oh shit, you didn't...
38974960	38975960	Oh, my bad.
38975960	38976960	I'm helping.
38976960	38977960	I'm helping.
38977960	38978960	I promise I'm helping.
38979960	38980960	See, look, I'm...
38982960	38983960	I'm helping.
38983960	38984960	I'm helping.
38985960	38988960	I think absolutely nothing should use me for a reason.
38989960	38990960	Okay, okay, I can do this.
38990960	38991960	I can do this.
38991960	38992960	I think we'll go a little bit away.
38994960	38995960	Skills.
38995960	38996960	Skills.
38996960	38997960	Do you see that input skill?
38997960	38998960	Okay, now we go down.
38999960	39000960	Descent.
39004960	39006960	Is that not a dark go-short one?
39006960	39007960	We've seen it before.
39008960	39009960	Ha ha.
39013960	39014960	Oh, are we going the wrong way?
39016960	39017960	Oopsie doopie.
39017960	39019960	We may have made an itchy doopie.
39020960	39021960	Okay, okay.
39021960	39022960	Okay.
39038960	39039960	We're in.
39039960	39040960	Can we all fit?
39042960	39043960	Are you coming in too?
39043960	39044960	Oh, no, he says come this way.
39047960	39050960	Oops, we're getting a little turned around in this area.
39050960	39052960	There's a lot to be honest, so it's fine.
39055960	39056960	Oh, there's an item down here.
39059960	39061960	It's missing school and eat.
39062960	39063960	Come, come, come.
39063960	39064960	Go down, he says.
39065960	39066960	Down we go.
39067960	39068960	There's a bat down there.
39068960	39069960	I will destroy this bat.
39071960	39072960	What?
39072960	39073960	Yeah!
39074960	39075960	Next right, not happening.
39078960	39079960	What is this?
39081960	39082960	Hmm.
39088960	39089960	Okay, now.
39090960	39092960	This, like, the map just gets the ground.
39092960	39093960	There's only one at a time.
39094960	39095960	No.
39096960	39097960	Can you fit?
39097960	39098960	Okay.
39098960	39099960	I don't want to push you off by accident.
39104960	39106960	We have trained Johnny wrong as a joke.
39106960	39107960	Oh, I'll bite you.
39111960	39112960	Did you launch yourself?
39112960	39113960	Were you on top of that?
39115960	39116960	I think we're on top of that.
39120960	39121960	Easy, easy.
39121960	39122960	Wait, open this?
39125960	39126960	Oh, you don't have the right.
39126960	39127960	You don't have the right.
39127960	39128960	You don't have the right.
39128960	39129960	Okay, and then take this down.
39132960	39133960	Okay, we can do it.
39134960	39135960	I don't know what we're doing,
39135960	39137960	but we're doing something already.
39141960	39143960	We have the old mother remote.
39143960	39144960	Yes.
39144960	39145960	Old mother.
39151960	39152960	Old mother.
39157960	39158960	I might just pick it up.
39159960	39160960	Whoa!
39163960	39164960	This is new.
39165960	39166960	Is it?
39166960	39167960	I think so.
39168960	39170960	In the room to the right by the statue,
39170960	39171960	use old mother.
39174960	39175960	I'm curious.
39179960	39180960	Old mother.
39180960	39181960	Old mother.
39196960	39197960	I'm curious.
39199960	39200960	What does this tablet do?
39200960	39203960	Have mercy for the start of the game.
39203960	39205960	Okay, sadly you have to leave,
39205960	39207960	but I assume there's another one.
39208960	39209960	Oh, that's so cool.
39209960	39211960	I love when games do that thing.
39215960	39217960	How on earth is anyone supposed to figure this out?
39217960	39218960	Naturally, though,
39218960	39219960	without being told what to do
39219960	39221960	or the dev team explaining what to do.
39222960	39224960	Oh, flowers!
39225960	39226960	Oh, my God.
39230960	39232960	There's so many!
39232960	39233960	Oh, my God.
39233960	39235960	How do you even perish here?
39237960	39238960	Oh, my God.
39240960	39241960	How do you?
39241960	39242960	How do you?
39244960	39245960	How do you?
39249960	39250960	Oh, my game crashed.
39250960	39252960	Oh, no, it survived.
39262960	39264960	You have to do parallel thinking,
39264960	39265960	looking up games on Google.
39265960	39267960	Yes, I can't have you guys here,
39267960	39268960	because the area is here.
39269960	39270960	Word of mouth,
39270960	39272960	people try random things in the first one,
39272960	39273960	but how?
39275960	39276960	Someone saw the statue and said,
39276960	39277960	Mom,
39277960	39279960	you just nullified it again up.
39282960	39284960	Is there anything coming up?
39284960	39285960	Oh, there is.
39288960	39290960	I think there's only C2, so...
39290960	39291960	I'll put C in.
39292960	39294960	Following the flow,
39294960	39295960	where is the flow?
39295960	39297960	Let's see if we can identify these flowers.
39302960	39303960	Oh, it's a recolor.
39309960	39310960	I don't know any of them.
39310960	39312960	I feel like it's a hibiscus
39312960	39313960	for the purple one.
39315960	39318960	The orange is just a generic coffee, honestly.
39319960	39320960	Or is it lavender?
39320960	39321960	No, that's not lavender.
39325960	39328960	Alright, link from Legend of Zelda again.
39330960	39332960	Is there any evil reeflings?
39332960	39334960	Or are we all perished at this point?
39338960	39339960	Okay.
39339960	39340960	Well,
39341960	39342960	no time like the prison,
39342960	39344960	we get to go through all these pretty flowers.
39344960	39345960	I can't believe it.
39346960	39347960	Oh, no.
39349960	39350960	Why is...
39351960	39352960	Why is that here?
39353960	39354960	Isn't that the thing
39354960	39356960	where an enemy comes out of nowhere?
39358960	39359960	Hmm.
39359960	39362960	This area is amazing.
39362960	39363960	It's so pretty!
39363960	39365960	Like, oh my god, dark souls actually
39365960	39366960	make like a really pretty ear.
39366960	39367960	Oh, eyes are so much blood.
39369960	39371960	Someone's getting walloped by something.
39373960	39374960	Ah, well, say no more.
39376960	39377960	Is he going for me?
39377960	39378960	I think so.
39379960	39380960	No, he's not going for me.
39380960	39381960	Yeah!
39381960	39382960	Okay, but...
39384960	39386960	Whoa, I can't even get it close.
39386960	39389960	I think I'm going to have to do baby stabs on him.
39389960	39391960	I'm too slow.
39391960	39393960	I think we're all too slow.
39395960	39397960	Can the horse even get staggered?
39408960	39409960	Oh!
39409960	39410960	We did stagger him.
39410960	39411960	Oh, no.
39411960	39413960	Sorry, I think I messed up.
39420960	39421960	I think we're doing all right.
39422960	39423960	Hello.
39423960	39424960	Well, thanks for the replays.
39424960	39425960	We're doing all right.
39438960	39441960	Oh, that stamina.
39441960	39442960	Ooh!
39447960	39449960	Oh, I'm getting freaking...
39454960	39456960	I think we're going to do it.
39462960	39464960	Whoa, that was a big swing.
39464960	39465960	Big swing.
39468960	39469960	Oh.
39470960	39471960	Wow.
39473960	39475960	That was fantastic.
39476960	39479960	Blessings of Marica, be upon me.
39479960	39481960	Do you guys despawn?
39482960	39485960	Or do we get to stand because it's...
39486960	39488960	Are you guys despawning or saying?
39488960	39490960	I don't know how it works here.
39491960	39493960	Grab it and twist his thoughts.
39493960	39494960	Grab it.
39494960	39496960	Grab it and twist his thoughts.
39496960	39497960	Grab it.
39497960	39499960	Okay, let's see what you guys get to say.
39500960	39501960	Okay.
39501960	39502960	See?
39502960	39503960	Exactly.
39503960	39504960	This is why...
39504960	39505960	Whoa.
39505960	39506960	Who not?
39506960	39511960	Enemy tangles spotted on 9 o'clock.
39512960	39514960	But we're not going to bother them,
39514960	39516960	so they're not going to bother us.
39517960	39518960	What's the tree sent another one?
39518960	39519960	They said,
39519960	39520960	Oh, is the tree sent another one
39520960	39522960	not hard enough for your new area?
39522960	39524960	Let's just add another one and buff them up.
39527960	39528960	Oh, my God.
39528960	39530960	See, this is where we're living.
39530960	39532960	A shaman's village.
39532960	39533960	Aw.
39535960	39537960	Look at all the flowers.
39539960	39541960	We love pretty flowers in this place.
39541960	39543960	Oh, is there a golden seed here?
39543960	39545960	Or is there no such thing as golden seed here?
39546960	39547960	Uh...
39551960	39552960	Straight to jail.
39554960	39555960	Teasing.
39555960	39556960	I'm teasing.
39558960	39559960	Whoa.
39559960	39560960	Is that noise?
39560960	39561960	I'm getting trolled.
39565960	39566960	Hello?
39568960	39569960	I heard something.
39571960	39572960	Knock, knock.
39572960	39574960	Okay, no one's home.
39576960	39578960	That's where I've been.
39578960	39580960	Not the music being the most peaceful music
39580960	39583960	I've ever heard in the entire series as well.
39584960	39588960	Just like a very quiet, low-toned heart.
39588960	39591960	Not giving off any emotion of excitement or...
39593960	39595960	I'm fucking losing it.
39598960	39600960	There's something here, guys.
39602960	39603960	Is it me?
39606960	39608960	I think it might be background noise,
39608960	39611960	but they're, for some reason, made it...
39613960	39614960	Is it me?
39614960	39615960	I'm going...
39615960	39616960	Sorry, I'm losing it.
39616960	39617960	I'm actually losing it.
39617960	39618960	I need to go to bed.
39618960	39619960	Holy crap.
39619960	39620960	I'm just straight up still spinning.
39620960	39621960	Okay.
39621960	39624960	We've got a golden lock of hair.
39624960	39627960	We've got Galadriel's lock of hair.
39627960	39628960	Holy.
39628960	39629960	Yes.
39630960	39631960	Good morning, woman.
39631960	39633960	I hope you're feeling better.
39633960	39635960	I fell asleep while I was...
39636960	39637960	What are you talking about?
39637960	39638960	There's nothing here.
39638960	39640960	Literally, I'm going crazy.
39641960	39643960	There's noises being made.
39652960	39653960	Attuded.
39653960	39655960	What are you going to do about it?
39658960	39659960	Oh, my God.
39659960	39662960	And I can't believe I complained
39662960	39665960	for a peaceful area where things don't attack you.
39665960	39667960	And I actually got it.
39667960	39672960	I actually got a peaceful, beautiful, nature-esque area.
39672960	39673960	Wow.
39673960	39675960	10 out of 10.
39675960	39676960	DLC.
39676960	39677960	Good.
39677960	39678960	Very recommend.
39684960	39686960	You've been going for 11 hours.
39686960	39687960	All this craziness.
39687960	39688960	Oh, did we hit 11 hours?
39688960	39689960	Well, there we go.
39691960	39693960	Honestly, every time Miya starts,
39693960	39695960	I'm like, I'm only doing six hours.
39695960	39696960	It's going to be shorter.
39696960	39697960	Oh, I'm only doing eight hours.
39697960	39699960	Oh, it's going to be shorter.
39699960	39700960	And then it's just like...
39700960	39701960	But after the eight hour mark,
39701960	39703960	I'm pretty sure we all just accept,
39703960	39706960	like, yeah, we're going for another four hours.
39706960	39708960	Are we going for them?
39709960	39711960	I don't have much heels,
39711960	39713960	but we can go for them.
39719960	39721960	Okay, we're doing it.
39721960	39722960	Jump them.
39724960	39726960	Regalings, stop this man.
39730960	39732960	He took half my health.
39734960	39735960	Oh, no.
39749960	39750960	It's his?
39750960	39751960	Oh, I'm out of stamina.
39751960	39752960	I'm sorry.
39755960	39757960	Miya, why am I not whacking him?
39757960	39759960	I literally have no stamina left.
39765960	39767960	Oh, I don't want to get perished.
39769960	39770960	I might get perished.
39772960	39773960	Oh, I missed.
39773960	39774960	I missed.
39777960	39779960	I have terrible news briefings.
39779960	39780960	I'm out of flash.
39780960	39783960	I think you guys are going to have to take over.
39784960	39785960	Hold on.
39785960	39786960	Let me get my board.
39786960	39787960	I can help.
39787960	39788960	I can help.
39788960	39789960	I promise I can help.
39789960	39790960	Nope, wrong one.
39790960	39791960	Shit.
39791960	39792960	Hold on.
39792960	39793960	Hold on.
39793960	39794960	Hold the line.
39794960	39795960	You're doing great.
39795960	39796960	You're doing great.
39796960	39797960	Mom's proud.
39797960	39798960	Oh, my God.
39798960	39800960	Please, man, you go away so I can actually help.
39803960	39805960	I've done a whole 75 damage.
39805960	39807960	Don't you worry, Reflins.
39807960	39808960	I've got you.
39810960	39812960	Is this guy missing on purpose?
39817960	39818960	Oh, God.
39818960	39819960	Where are the-
39819960	39820960	Hello?
39820960	39823960	Did he just go invisible or did I just, like,
39823960	39824960	go out of bounds?
39824960	39825960	Because what was that?
39829960	39831960	I'm trying to give him bleed arrows.
39831960	39833960	Trying being the main freaking-
39834960	39836960	Yeah, forget your silly damage.
39837960	39838960	Whoa.
39844960	39845960	I'm trying.
39845960	39846960	I'm trying.
39846960	39847960	My crosshair's on him.
39847960	39849960	I just freaking do it, okay?
39850960	39851960	I'm-
39855960	39856960	Um...
39856960	39857960	Um...
39860960	39862960	Oh, what did he do?
39862960	39865960	I didn't even know he could do that.
39865960	39867960	You're carrying so hard.
39867960	39869960	Yeah, you're, like, my 75 damage.
39870960	39871960	Bruh.
39874960	39876960	How did I use this?
39878960	39879960	Oh, is that it?
39882960	39884960	Is it, like, unlimited use?
39884960	39886960	Trying to just, like, fire everything?
39887960	39889960	Oh, it's not even taking any stamina or anything.
39892960	39894960	Fuck it, I'm gonna try that.
39894960	39896960	Okay, let's try this again.
39897960	39900960	Rope hop to literally halfway across the map.
39900960	39902960	Who was an adventure?
39902960	39903960	Oh, you weren't an-
39903960	39904960	No, where-
39904960	39906960	You weren't an adventure.
39908960	39910960	You weren't an adventure.
39910960	39912960	Were you an adventure?
39913960	39914960	I'm moving up.
39914960	39915960	I'm- I'm gonna try the fire.
39915960	39916960	I don't know what the heck it is.
39916960	39919960	It's also dual wield if you get two.
39920960	39921960	Damn.
39925960	39926960	Oh, reflings.
39926960	39929960	It's time to get put to work.
39929960	39931960	Get back on the farm.
39931960	39933960	Weat those potatoes.
39933960	39936960	We are going to have a delicious supper tonight.
39938960	39939960	And...
39940960	39942960	No, no, no, I wouldn't do that.
39943960	39944960	I'm gonna try the flame.
39944960	39945960	I don't know.
39945960	39946960	I thought it was gonna do much,
39946960	39948960	but it's, like, literally three, so...
39952960	39953960	Let's get to it.
39953960	39954960	To it.
39954960	39956960	Let's get this party started.
39956960	39959960	You hit Y and right bumper to dual wield it.
39959960	39960960	Y and right bumper.
39962960	39963960	That was a left bumper.
39963960	39964960	Left bumper.
39968960	39969960	Oh!
39974960	39976960	Hi, cast pyro!
39980960	39981960	The fire?
39981960	39982960	Wait, wait, wait.
39982960	39983960	Set it on, set it on.
39985960	39986960	Please, what?
39986960	39987960	I'm sorry.
39987960	39988960	I feel like it would hurt.
39989960	39991960	I would, uh...
39991960	39993960	I am not sure...
39997960	39999960	Right, what happens now?
39999960	40000960	Achoo!
40000960	40001960	Achoo!
40001960	40003960	Oh, my God, it does nothing.
40003960	40004960	It does nothing.
40004960	40005960	I mean, I'm not surprised
40005960	40007960	considering it didn't specialize in it or anything,
40007960	40008960	but...
40008960	40010960	Yeah, let's just, uh...
40010960	40011960	Get this out.
40014960	40015960	What?
40015960	40016960	What?
40021960	40023960	Whoa, we are doing stuff.
40023960	40024960	Stuff to him.
40026960	40028960	Oh, I always knock him out of that.
40028960	40029960	I'm so sorry.
40029960	40030960	I knocked him out of the special attack there.
40030960	40031960	Am I bad?
40031960	40032960	Oh.
40032960	40033960	I moved a little to the left
40033960	40035960	and managed to avoid his attack.
40035960	40036960	That was funny.
40039960	40040960	Hey, leave him alone.
40042960	40043960	Leave him alone.
40043960	40044960	Jeez, change, change.
40044960	40045960	Look at me.
40046960	40048960	He does not want to change off of you.
40049960	40050960	Jeez.
40052960	40054960	Okay, have it out.
40054960	40055960	Shit.
40058960	40060960	Okay, I actually have heals this time,
40060960	40062960	so not too much.
40072960	40073960	Oh, I knocked it.
40075960	40078960	Okay, that horse jumped over me.
40078960	40079960	Oh.
40079960	40080960	Not good, not good, not good.
40080960	40081960	Give me that.
40082960	40083960	Give me a good chip.
40089960	40090960	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
40090960	40091960	I need a cheeky heal after that one.
40091960	40092960	Hold on.
40100960	40101960	Jeez.
40101960	40103960	Get further and further away from me.
40106960	40107960	I'm trying.
40107960	40108960	I'm trying.
40109960	40111960	Is there any damage to help me?
40111960	40112960	Oh, and of course,
40112960	40114960	I get a hit when I'm out of stamina.
40119960	40120960	We're almost there.
40121960	40123960	Take your days, horseman.
40127960	40128960	Oh.
40128960	40129960	Oh.
40129960	40130960	Oh, come on.
40130960	40132960	The physics were going nuts there.
40133960	40134960	Oh.
40134960	40136960	Gee is a shot, mate.
40136960	40137960	Gee is a shot.
40142960	40143960	Oh, my God.
40143960	40145960	He just turned to face me last second.
40150960	40151960	Oh, goodness me.
40151960	40153960	Does he do some damage?
40153960	40155960	He's stuck on the hill.
40162960	40164960	If he does that holy shield thing,
40164960	40166960	by the way, don't let him actually...
40166960	40167960	Oh, no.
40168960	40169960	Oh, no.
40171960	40172960	Hold on.
40173960	40175960	Oh, he took one HP in a dream.
40178960	40180960	Whoa, who's gonna die now?
40181960	40182960	Oh.
40183960	40185960	Whoa, the final blow.
40187960	40189960	I'm truly blessed that there's actually...
40189960	40190960	Oh, my goodness me.
40190960	40192960	Bro, are we where it's built?
40192960	40196960	I actually don't know if there's another one.
40196960	40198960	Right, well, we'll go back and pick up a refill
40198960	40199960	and really quickly.
40199960	40200960	Hold on.
40200960	40201960	I'm coming.
40203960	40204960	Real finger.
40204960	40205960	Wait, you let...
40205960	40206960	Oh, you...
40206960	40207960	Oh, because I...
40207960	40209960	Wait, that kind of just a boss as well.
40210960	40211960	It's starting to if you whip me
40211960	40212960	every more than half of it,
40212960	40213960	and I can explain.
40213960	40214960	Bro, but it's staying.
40214960	40216960	Like, whips are serious.
40217960	40219960	If you mean like a Raiden Crop,
40219960	40220960	I think that's okay,
40220960	40221960	but I couldn't imagine
40221960	40223960	like actually inflict some damage on a refund.
40223960	40225960	I just feel like I'm so sorry.
40226960	40228960	Then again, also me, like,
40228960	40230960	with literal acquisition.
40230960	40231960	Get up.
40231960	40232960	Wait, where is it?
40232960	40233960	Is there no...
40233960	40234960	Oh.
40237960	40238960	I've got one refill.
40239960	40241960	I've got two refill in here.
40242960	40243960	And let's go.
40244960	40245960	Follow the path then.
40245960	40247960	You can use part now.
40247960	40248960	Yeah, I've got my refunds
40248960	40250960	to help me follow the path then.
40251960	40252960	I'm the horse.
40252960	40253960	They can ride me.
40259960	40260960	That scared me.
40260960	40261960	Don't make that...
40261960	40262960	Oh, you're mean.
40262960	40264960	Aw, they had to put me...
40266960	40267960	Oh, you're healing me.
40267960	40268960	Thank you.
40270960	40272960	As long as you're trying your best.
40273960	40274960	Remember that time I said
40274960	40276960	I was gonna subtitle the mimosa video?
40277960	40278960	The mimosa ASMR flop?
40280960	40282960	She is so patient with me.
40288960	40290960	Wow, the boar's coming to get me.
40293960	40295960	It's a good thing.
40296960	40297960	I think there's a thing
40297960	40299960	and then there's like, ow.
40300960	40302960	I feel like that would be ow.
40305960	40307960	Stone bell bearing.
40307960	40308960	Mmm.
40308960	40310960	I do need to upgrade this sword.
40311960	40313960	I keep falling for like, exploring and like,
40313960	40314960	ooh, what's next, what's next?
40314960	40315960	Instead of like, okay,
40315960	40316960	maybe I should upgrade my base stuff
40316960	40318960	so it'll actually hit a bit harder.
40319960	40320960	Instead of being like, wow,
40320960	40322960	I'm only doing 100 damage every turn.
40322960	40323960	Hmm, what a surprise.
40323960	40324960	Does anyone even shop?
40326960	40328960	Is my tummy rumbling for food?
40329960	40330960	I ate.
40330960	40331960	I had a burger.
40331960	40332960	I'm chicken.
40332960	40333960	What are you eating?
40334960	40336960	Wow, there's a thing.
40336960	40337960	Oh, maybe I should have done that
40337960	40338960	and called you guys in
40338960	40339960	instead of making you go for
40339960	40341960	a jogging exercise routine.
40342960	40343960	Left foot, right foot.
40343960	40344960	Left foot, right foot.
40344960	40345960	A thing.
40345960	40346960	Oh, there's an enemy we've learned.
40348960	40350960	Oh, there's two enemy we've learned.
40350960	40352960	So there's not been none forever.
40354960	40356960	Have you been in for a while?
40356960	40357960	I don't think so.
40359960	40360960	What's that?
40360960	40361960	Did you just drop a turd?
40361960	40362960	What did you just do?
40364960	40366960	It's called first love students, do you know what?
40366960	40367960	If you upgrade your weapon,
40367960	40368960	you'll deal massive damage.
40368960	40370960	Okay, maybe we should try that tomorrow.
40372960	40373960	I didn't stop.
40374960	40375960	I didn't take forever.
40375960	40376960	I didn't take forever.
40376960	40377960	I didn't take forever.
40377960	40379960	That tree looks very menacing.
40381960	40383960	And I'm dead.
40384960	40385960	Whoa.
40387960	40389960	You're a bit too excited being spawned in.
40389960	40390960	What's going on here?
40390960	40391960	Yeah, okay.
40391960	40392960	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
40392960	40393960	Okay, we forgive you.
40393960	40394960	We forgive you.
40394960	40396960	You don't have to exile yourself.
40396960	40397960	We forgive you.
40398960	40400960	It's got a little excited being coming back in.
40401960	40402960	Okay.
40402960	40404960	Two of the bell bearings are unfortunately
40406960	40407960	Azula.
40407960	40409960	Not to be confused with Azura.
40409960	40411960	Which is right before you finish the game.
40411960	40412960	Oh.
40413960	40414960	That seems a bit silly.
40414960	40415960	Do you know where you're taking us,
40415960	40416960	enemy recently?
40416960	40417960	Reeflings?
40419960	40420960	Does anyone...
40420960	40421960	Wait, we need a group huddle.
40421960	40422960	Reeflings, we need a group huddle.
40422960	40423960	Come.
40423960	40424960	Come.
40424960	40425960	Reefling, come down.
40425960	40426960	Come down.
40426960	40427960	We need a group huddle.
40427960	40428960	We need a group huddle.
40428960	40429960	Okay, let me just...
40429960	40431960	Where the fuck are we going?
40431960	40432960	I'm so lost right now.
40432960	40435960	I've never seen this place before.
40435960	40436960	Where are we going?
40441960	40442960	Okay, we have a torch.
40442960	40443960	We have a torch bearer.
40443960	40444960	Okay.
40444960	40445960	Okay, let's go.
40445960	40446960	Okay, we're ready.
40446960	40447960	We're going back.
40447960	40448960	We're going up a hill.
40448960	40450960	Okay, I need to go to bed and fall.
40450960	40451960	Let me put up my desk.
40451960	40452960	Rest well.
40452960	40453960	Sleep well.
40453960	40454960	Sleep dream.
40454960	40455960	Have dreams of Karen,
40455960	40456960	Mayo, and Elvin ring.
40456960	40457960	Thank you.
40458960	40459960	That's all I need.
40459960	40460960	That's all I ask for.
40460960	40461960	Oh.
40461960	40462960	Oops.
40463960	40464960	Hmm.
40465960	40467960	There's two sacred tears
40467960	40468960	in the realm of the giants.
40468960	40469960	We're better off.
40470960	40471960	Hmm.
40472960	40473960	Yes.
40473960	40475960	If anyone needs to go to sleep,
40475960	40476960	please don't worry.
40476960	40477960	You may go to sleep.
40477960	40478960	I...
40478960	40479960	Unfortunately,
40479960	40480960	we're actually against the clock
40480960	40481960	and we've got around 30 minutes
40481960	40483960	now before the vod explodes.
40484960	40485960	Right, on the classic
40485960	40487960	11 hours and 55 minutes.
40487960	40488960	Ka-blamel.
40490960	40491960	Wah.
40492960	40493960	Where are these?
40494960	40495960	Oh, they're alive?
40496960	40498960	Well, I don't like that one bit.
40498960	40499960	No, sorry.
40502960	40503960	Night night,
40503960	40505960	I will have dreams of just Karen.
40507960	40508960	Another refling
40508960	40510960	that couldn't last as long as a memory.
40510960	40511960	A tale is all this time.
40512960	40513960	Only 30 minutes.
40513960	40515960	Shoot, I'll crash after that then.
40515960	40517960	Oh no, if you need to go to sleep,
40517960	40518960	don't stay up
40518960	40519960	just because like,
40519960	40521960	we're only going to be 30 more minutes.
40522960	40524960	Over the fingering place.
40524960	40525960	Out of context.
40525960	40526960	Oh, right.
40526960	40527960	Okay, I get it.
40527960	40528960	I get it.
40528960	40530960	The creepiest enemy
40530960	40531960	in the game
40531960	40532960	had to have had its own
40532960	40534960	literal massive maze.
40534960	40535960	Oh.
40535960	40536960	I'm not a fan.
40536960	40537960	Well, we just run for it.
40537960	40539960	I think we can just run for it, right?
40542960	40543960	I'm just running.
40543960	40545960	I'm just running
40545960	40547960	faster than I ever had.
40548960	40550960	I've already lost the lookout.
40550960	40552960	Okay, I found the lookout.
40552960	40554960	He's over here a little to the right.
40554960	40556960	Head south side, refling.
40556960	40557960	South side.
40557960	40559960	We're still running.
40559960	40561960	Faster than we ever could.
40562960	40564960	Let in our little feet.
40564960	40565960	Run.
40565960	40567960	South side.
40567960	40569960	Our main plan.
40569960	40571960	We're still running.
40572960	40574960	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
40576960	40577960	Where the heck?
40577960	40579960	I blink and gauge refling
40579960	40580960	always disappears.
40582960	40583960	Apparently the morning shift
40583960	40584960	is pretty quiet.
40584960	40585960	What did I miss?
40586960	40588960	Um, we're in a,
40588960	40590960	the fart zone apparently,
40590960	40592960	because everything's green.
40592960	40594960	I'm not sure if that,
40594960	40596960	is that supposed to happen?
40596960	40598960	We're now in the finger location
40598960	40599960	in the DLC.
40599960	40600960	No idea what it is.
40600960	40602960	There's something in the distance.
40602960	40603960	There is no way that is attacking us
40603960	40605960	from the distance.
40609960	40610960	Hello?
40614960	40616960	Reflings absolutely annihilate
40616960	40618960	that figure.
40618960	40620960	It wishes there's nothing but harm.
40621960	40623960	And we will punish it
40623960	40625960	for its transgression.
40625960	40626960	Oh my God, they can do it
40626960	40628960	all from halfway across the map.
40628960	40629960	Hello?
40629960	40630960	Oh!
40632960	40633960	Okay, take that.
40633960	40634960	No poise.
40634960	40635960	No stamina.
40635960	40637960	No nothing going through it.
40637960	40638960	Don't,
40638960	40640960	from halfway across the map.
40640960	40641960	Right, do be careful.
40641960	40642960	Be vigilant.
40642960	40644960	I don't know what the purple does.
40644960	40646960	Oh, there's two more group top over here.
40647960	40649960	Did we just keep running?
40650960	40652960	Honestly, your side step is pretty good.
40652960	40654960	I won't, I won't admit.
40654960	40656960	Your side step is pretty good.
40656960	40658960	Okay, it's like a purple bomb.
40663960	40665960	Oh my God, it's spit-file.
40665960	40666960	It's spit-file.
40666960	40667960	Of course it's spit-file.
40667960	40668960	Why wouldn't I spit-file?
40668960	40670960	Oh, I'm out of stamina.
40671960	40674960	Okay, thank goodness.
40674960	40676960	They can just get staggered beyond belief.
40676960	40678960	Sorry, but this DLC,
40678960	40680960	everything seems to be staggerable
40680960	40681960	for the most part,
40681960	40683960	which just makes it so worth it
40683960	40686960	to be like two-handed heavy.
40686960	40688960	Alright, feels like that anyway.
40688960	40690960	That's just me, honestly.
40690960	40691960	I've just made,
40691960	40692960	oh jeez Louise,
40692960	40693960	something got me good.
40693960	40694960	I don't know what,
40694960	40696960	unless it was that one.
40696960	40699960	My brain literally couldn't process it.
40699960	40702960	We've got a finger mimic.
40706960	40708960	But what point in the DLC are we at?
40708960	40709960	That's the fun part.
40709960	40711960	I know nothing of the DLC,
40711960	40714960	so I can't even accurately give anything.
40714960	40715960	This is what the map looks like.
40715960	40718960	We're now in the fingery part of the map.
40718960	40720960	That's the best I've got.
40720960	40722960	This used to be some sort of
40722960	40725960	totem type thing.
40725960	40727960	I'll touch it in a teleport maybe?
40729960	40731960	Read the message.
40731960	40732960	What did I do?
40732960	40733960	Read the message.
40733960	40734960	I did it.
40734960	40736960	Time to finger.
40742960	40744960	I'm not built like I wanted to
40744960	40747960	draw for like a bug or something.
40747960	40748960	No, you can.
40748960	40749960	You are free to lurk,
40749960	40750960	you're free to chat,
40750960	40752960	and whatever is your comfort level.
40752960	40755960	Can I not interact with you guys here?
40755960	40758960	Or do I need to do something?
40759960	40761960	Do I stick my...
40761960	40763960	Well, you know, what on earth?
40763960	40765960	But rest well for those who need to sleep.
40765960	40768960	You need a special item for a quest.
40770960	40771960	Word of warning,
40771960	40773960	if you ever go to the church of eclipse,
40773960	40774960	you will be jumpscared.
40774960	40776960	Okay, thank you for letting me know.
40780960	40783960	I need an item of some kind.
40784960	40787960	Is that my fingy?
40787960	40790960	Did you talk to the guy in a church on a throne?
40790960	40793960	No.
40793960	40795960	I don't think so.
40801960	40803960	Am I supposed to?
40812960	40813960	Go get an item.
40813960	40814960	I gotta go.
40814960	40816960	Thanks for this yappies.
40816960	40818960	You're more than welcome, please rest well.
40818960	40820960	Do what you gotta do.
40820960	40821960	It's a finger.
40821960	40822960	I think you don't stick something in it.
40822960	40825960	You must likely do the opposite.
40825960	40830960	Back to manage my tire with you.
40830960	40831960	Okay.
40844960	40845960	Oh wait, sorry.
40845960	40846960	Everyone taught me.
40846960	40848960	Was it mana?
40848960	40849960	Me.
40849960	40851960	Wait, mo?
40851960	40854960	Wait, I don't have it?
40854960	40857960	Left of where you are in blue.
40858960	40860960	Ah, that's right.
40860960	40862960	Wait, I can't.
40862960	40863960	Oh, sorry.
40863960	40865960	Reefling is okay if you leave.
40865960	40867960	That can go teleporting.
40867960	40869960	To the left, there's a...
40869960	40871960	I don't think I need to fight though.
40871960	40873960	Wait, am I gonna have to come all the way back here then?
40873960	40875960	Am I just gonna come back here and horseback the first time?
40875960	40877960	Do that then.
40878960	40880960	Oh, it's been a pleasure.
40880960	40882960	Woo-hoo!
40886960	40887960	No?
40887960	40888960	Okay.
40888960	40890960	There's a man in here to speak to.
40890960	40892960	And there's no fight in here.
40892960	40893960	Don't...
40893960	40894960	There's no fight.
40894960	40895960	I know the area is safe.
40895960	40899960	I don't have to be absolutely terrified.
40899960	40901960	Fucking hell it's dark in here.
40901960	40904960	I'm fucking breaking it.
40904960	40905960	Okay.
40906960	40908960	Please don't be a fight.
40908960	40910960	Please don't be a fight.
40910960	40912960	Please don't be a fight.
40912960	40914960	Please don't be a fight.
40914960	40916960	Please don't be a fight.
40916960	40918960	Oh, there's blood everywhere!
40918960	40919960	Reefling!
40922960	40924960	There's literally blood everywhere.
40924960	40925960	No!
40925960	40927960	No, you can't do this to me.
40927960	40930960	I'm exhausted and you want me to fight?
40931960	40933960	Oh, there's blood everywhere.
40933960	40935960	Where's the enemy?
40935960	40939960	It's not all a lock and onto an enemy.
40939960	40941960	You gotta fuck up his shit.
40941960	40942960	Fuck up his shit.
40942960	40943960	Fuck up his shit.
40943960	40945960	Please, let me speak to you and give me a finger or something.
40945960	40946960	Hello?
40946960	40948960	Well, we don't often receive visitors.
40948960	40951960	No, apparently you killed them all the way down the floor.
40951960	40953960	Welcome to Manus Meta.
40953960	40955960	It is a pleasure to have you.
40955960	40957960	Oh, give me your finger or whatever.
40957960	40959960	You are so forsaken as these.
40959960	40962960	Chance encounters are precious indeed.
40962960	40965960	Seeing that we have convened here on this day,
40965960	40970960	allow me to mark the occasion with a modest offering.
40972960	40973960	Okay.
40977960	40979960	Okay, get me the hell out of here.
40981960	40983960	Why is there death in there?
40985960	40987960	Why are people dying in there?
40987960	40989960	Did they attack him?
40989960	40991960	And he absolutely walloped them?
40991960	40992960	Right.
40992960	40995960	I'm just going to speed run through this area because
40995960	40997960	we've already checked if we're clear to that.
40998960	41000960	Oh, it's a mama finger and all her little...
41000960	41002960	Oh, and it's Papa's finger.
41002960	41005960	God, you guys fucking breathe like nothing on Earth.
41005960	41006960	You need to get our tubes shot.
41006960	41007960	Holy shit.
41008960	41010960	Do you know like after the third child,
41010960	41012960	it gets really irresponsible?
41015960	41016960	They're just going to school.
41016960	41018960	Okay, they're just going to school.
41019960	41022960	Wow, I can't see nothing.
41028960	41031960	I guess you could see the finger bit.
41033960	41034960	Oh, thank you.
41034960	41036960	Oh, I just dropped my piece of paper that has
41036960	41038960	everyone's name on it over here.
41048960	41049960	Okay.
41054960	41057960	Aw, Reflin's leave me for literally five seconds
41057960	41060960	and I'm in an utter, like utter disarray.
41060960	41062960	Utter disarray.
41062960	41064960	Utter dis, the fucking...
41072960	41075960	I will call you guys in and you can hold my hand
41075960	41077960	down to where I need to go.
41079960	41081960	Oh, of course.
41081960	41084960	Oh, of course, I can't just walk down.
41085960	41087960	Oh, I'm looking so bad at the game.
41089960	41091960	Oh, sorry.
41091960	41093960	Serves you right for your lame joke.
41093960	41095960	It was one of your jokes.
41096960	41098960	A Reflin joke.
41099960	41102960	Literally, the one time I don't get my hand held down,
41102960	41105960	I immediately get fucking...
41106960	41109960	And absolutely obliterated in the skyline.
41110960	41112960	Why do they always put something weird in these games?
41112960	41115960	Oh, they can't even handle it, honestly.
41117960	41120960	It was my joke and it was funny.
41120960	41122960	Yeah, that's why I stole it.
41125960	41128960	Is there any other Reflin that's able to guide me
41128960	41130960	through fingerstone hell?
41131960	41133960	Fingerstone hell?
41133960	41135960	Barely even nor.
41135960	41137960	Sorry, fingerstone?
41137960	41139960	That's hardly even.
41139960	41141960	Doesn't make anything.
41141960	41143960	God, they're so pretty.
41144960	41146960	Why are they getting closer to us?
41146960	41148960	Reflin that spawned in?
41148960	41150960	Just be careful, they're getting a bit close.
41150960	41152960	It's locked onto you, Reflin.
41154960	41156960	I think it's locked onto you.
41156960	41158960	I think we're about to get pummeled by this.
41158960	41160960	Okay, he's ready.
41160960	41163960	With the powerful aura of the Reflin,
41163960	41166960	they retreat for his stamina,
41166960	41169960	his menacing aura is just far too much
41169960	41171960	for the game to handle.
41173960	41175960	It checks out, it's checking out.
41175960	41177960	Look at him, he's sizing up the Reflin.
41177960	41178960	What does he say?
41178960	41180960	He's thinking about it,
41180960	41182960	he thinks about challenging the Reflin,
41182960	41185960	but is he going to make a mistake of his life?
41185960	41187960	He's going to make the mistake of his life,
41187960	41189960	he couldn't help it.
41189960	41191960	It's too much.
41191960	41193960	It's overwhelming, truly.
41195960	41198960	Oh, he regretted it, he regretted it.
41198960	41201960	He underestimated the Reflin,
41201960	41203960	and now he's gone.
41203960	41205960	Back to the urge tree with you.
41205960	41207960	Finger papa is dead.
41207960	41209960	Sorry, he was asking for it, that's for Hansy.
41210960	41212960	Can you have too much testosterone,
41212960	41214960	you think you rule the world?
41215960	41218960	Right, how the fuck do we get past them?
41218960	41220960	Oh wait, we can run past these ones, can't we?
41220960	41222960	They can't keep up.
41223960	41225960	I think we can just run past.
41225960	41227960	Are we just destroying the entire bloodline?
41227960	41229960	Okay, nah, just walk past them.
41229960	41231960	My weapon's too shit.
41232960	41235960	I need to help with the wiggly worms, really.
41236960	41238960	Oh shit, the Reflin's getting gang banged.
41238960	41240960	Oh no, he's getting Reflin run.
41240960	41242960	Do you have enough heals?
41242960	41244960	Yeah, you're good.
41245960	41248960	It's the worms that we need to be worried about, honestly.
41248960	41252960	Look at that little fire barrier.
41252960	41255960	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, see that hand?
41255960	41258960	Just run past, just run past, we have stamina.
41261960	41263960	Because the mummy...
41263960	41266960	This Reflin said nah, it's personal,
41266960	41269960	you don't ever do that to me, you jumping me like that?
41270960	41273960	Hands, F around and found out, what's going on?
41273960	41276960	I remember the first time I found a finger hand monster,
41276960	41278960	I think my neighbors also remember that.
41280960	41283960	Right, this is the part where I got fricking jumped
41283960	41286960	by like a whole gang of worms.
41287960	41290960	I need to be careful of those fricking pulsing bombs.
41290960	41292960	I wish I had like the lightning strike magic,
41292960	41294960	where you can like fire...
41294960	41296960	Is it like Zeus? I think it's Zeus.
41297960	41299960	Yeah, that...
41300960	41303960	Basically do it for like how far away?
41303960	41305960	That's not even for me, I'm getting nervous.
41307960	41309960	I don't know if I just need to do the magic one.
41310960	41313960	I need my Glyx one, I thought that was coming for me.
41313960	41315960	Really got handed to the Reflins?
41315960	41318960	Well, from how good they are at like holding my hand.
41318960	41320960	I'll get you out of there.
41320960	41322960	Whoa, they spawn in on you!
41322960	41324960	No, I'm just going to save you!
41327960	41330960	What happened?
41330960	41333960	How did we do it so perfectly last time?
41337960	41340960	If you get caught by that fucking pink thing,
41340960	41343960	these ones can just spawn over to you?
41344960	41346960	Oh no, I got caught!
41346960	41348960	Wait, I can still roll though.
41349960	41351960	Oh my god.
41352960	41354960	That's outrageous!
41355960	41357960	So hard for no reason.
41357960	41359960	No, didn't you bother me?
41359960	41361960	Fucking cheeky wee shit.
41361960	41363960	Honestly, I'm out of stamina on everyone.
41363960	41365960	Grab someone else you wee fucking wee.
41365960	41367960	Weirdo.
41368960	41370960	I better go right through me.
41370960	41372960	I'm not having that.
41373960	41375960	Oh, it's a Paralysm scale.
41375960	41377960	It's me! I'm Paralysm.
41377960	41379960	Oh shit, are we healing?
41379960	41381960	Oh no, I'm not healing.
41381960	41383960	Okay, let's be up these worms and then we're there.
41384960	41387960	I think this one's already locked on to us.
41387960	41389960	It is. It's just been a wee liar.
41389960	41391960	Yeah, they're both locked on to us.
41391960	41394960	It's just pretending to not be locked on.
41399960	41401960	There we go.
41401960	41403960	A liar.
41403960	41405960	Is that one locked on to us?
41405960	41408960	It looks like it. Yeah, it's locked on.
41408960	41410960	Time to go at nine o'clock.
41411960	41413960	There we go.
41416960	41418960	Look at my survivability percentages.
41418960	41420960	Go up when I've got refunds.
41420960	41422960	It's amazing.
41422960	41424960	I did this all myself.
41424960	41426960	Smile.
41426960	41428960	I've never seen them do it.
41428960	41430960	I love how we're doing that harder.
41430960	41433960	Hands in this area is a bit touchy.
41433960	41435960	Finger ruin is finger ruin.
41435960	41437960	Either way, it's getting done.
41437960	41442960	Okay, now I can do what I need to do at this area.
41442960	41444960	Can I do it while you guys are present?
41444960	41446960	Yes, I can.
41448960	41450960	Oh, it's a horn.
41452960	41454960	What does that do?
41455960	41458960	A cerulean seat talisman.
41458960	41460960	I don't know.
41465960	41467960	You don't...
41467960	41469960	Why am I not being told my stats?
41469960	41471960	What does it do?
41471960	41473960	I don't know.
41475960	41477960	These are where all the fingers that get lost go.
41477960	41479960	Well, at least they have a horn.
41479960	41482960	Wait, why is it that it's not telling what it lost?
41482960	41484960	How strange. Am I going crazy?
41484960	41486960	A little bit.
41486960	41488960	Greatly boost magic.
41488960	41490960	Oh, well...
41497960	41499960	Right, so we got our finger talisman.
41499960	41502960	We've been through the flowers.
41502960	41507960	We've also been through this incredibly crazy path.
41511960	41514960	Oh, there's another finger city?
41517960	41519960	Oh, I thought we did it.
41520960	41522960	There's more fingers?
41524960	41526960	Hey, when you go back to the church,
41526960	41529960	there's another NPC leaning up against the pillar to the right
41529960	41531960	that you should go back to the same church.
41531960	41533960	Okay, Riesling, thank you for insisting me all this way.
41533960	41537960	I don't know why I got so banged up, like, going on my own,
41537960	41539960	but honestly, just proof that I need you guys.
41539960	41542960	Thank you so much for helping me get here.
41542960	41543960	Hope that helps.
41543960	41545960	Dangerous again, honestly.
41548960	41550960	Okay, and then there's someone...
41550960	41553960	Go back to the church, there's an NPC leaning on the right
41553960	41556960	that I need to talk to in order to...
41556960	41558960	How much time have I got?
41558960	41561960	I've only got less than 5 minutes.
41561960	41563960	We're responding.
41563960	41566960	NPC to the right in this room?
41566960	41568960	Okay.
41572960	41574960	Man, I can't see shit, I need my glakes on.
41574960	41576960	Oh, crap.
41576960	41577960	Oh, there you are.
41577960	41579960	Sorry, couldn't see you there again.
41579960	41580960	Hi.
41597960	41599960	Anything else?
41602960	41604960	Are you sure?
41606960	41609960	Hey, I got, like, this talisman thing, do you want it back?
41609960	41611960	It's not really mine.
41627960	41629960	It's like a thing.
41641960	41643960	Oh, I did it the wrong way.
41646960	41648960	Wait, man, idiot, did I get the wrong...
41651960	41653960	Am I a dum-dum?
41654960	41656960	Ask about the name Black Armor.
41670960	41673960	Do they have time to do the other thing, you rune?
41673960	41675960	You think?
41675960	41677960	Okay.
41682960	41684960	Okay.
41684960	41687960	Okay, I'll move on, how do I get there?
41687960	41689960	This one?
41690960	41693960	Why would it give me a map?
41698960	41700960	It's not even highlighted.
41700960	41702960	Why go through these animals to school?
41702960	41704960	Ooh, enjoying it.
41704960	41707960	I'm exhausted, but, like, I can't get enough.
41707960	41710960	I was, I said, like, fucking, at the start of the stream,
41710960	41712960	I was like, this isn't going to be an endurance stream.
41712960	41714960	At six hours in, I was like, am I going to go off soon?
41714960	41716960	Eight hours in, am I going to go off soon?
41716960	41718960	We need to actually go off in 20 minutes
41718960	41720960	because the board's going to explode.
41720960	41722960	Check the papers from the inventory.
41735960	41737960	Examine using X.
41737960	41739960	Well, I can't fucking see it.
41739960	41741960	So, do you want to try again?
41741960	41743960	Switch view.
41745960	41746960	Switch display.
41746960	41748960	Are you trolling me right now?
41754960	41755960	Will you start a second stream?
41755960	41757960	No, it's my bedtime for me, sadly.
41758960	41760960	Um...
41760960	41761960	Am I being trolled?
41761960	41763960	No, that's fine.
41763960	41765960	I'm being trolled, and I'll literally not look at that figure.
41765960	41767960	Surely I can.
41767960	41769960	Select an item to interact with it.
41769960	41772960	A, use leave discard.
41772960	41774960	Okay, now make it bigger
41774960	41776960	so I can actually read the damn thing.
41778960	41780960	Are you fucking joking?
41780960	41783960	Like, I know it's down there, but, like, are you serious?
41783960	41785960	Are you trolled?
41787960	41789960	That's all you can see.
41789960	41792960	The game won't even, like, I know it's here,
41792960	41794960	but...
41794960	41795960	Wait, how do I get down there?
41795960	41798960	Can you just put a bridge here?
41798960	41801960	So, really, in close?
41801960	41803960	What? Go...
41806960	41808960	Okay.
41809960	41812960	We may have to explode operations, however,
41812960	41815960	because I don't know how much time's going to take.
41815960	41817960	Gee, I wonder where it's close.
41817960	41819960	Ah, truly a mystery.
41820960	41822960	I'm out on my own.
41822960	41824960	You'll see such things.
41824960	41826960	You'll see such horrible things to me.
41826960	41828960	Does that have to do with someone who's a big girl?
41828960	41830960	I assume, what, if I go around,
41830960	41833960	and then there's a walk, walk, and then...
41833960	41835960	a walk?
41837960	41839960	I'd have watched what I've been playing all day.
41839960	41841960	Honestly, me, though.
41841960	41843960	I've got my thing down.
41843960	41845960	Oh, no, I can't lose you then.
41845960	41847960	Tomorrow's Elden Ring, yeah, tomorrow's another Elden Ring,
41847960	41851960	and then I don't know what we're going to achieve tomorrow.
41851960	41853960	Um...
41853960	41854960	Oh, there's a bee weeping.
41854960	41856960	Uh, Rusyn...
41856960	41858960	Who's...
41858960	41859960	Who's been...
41859960	41861960	Who's the last time?
41861960	41864960	Shilinfin, did I have you in at the horror?
41864960	41866960	I don't know, though.
41867960	41870960	Um, I'm so sorry if I'm, like, avoiding...
41870960	41872960	by accident.
41872960	41875960	Rusyn, I've been seeing you at the floor.
41876960	41878960	I can't remember until...
41878960	41880960	Are you playing on PC?
41880960	41883960	Yes, it's PC, and then you can stream snipe, uh, technically,
41883960	41886960	due to, um...
41888960	41891960	holding my hands to the game.
41891960	41893960	Uh...
41895960	41897960	I'm itching my face.
41897960	41899960	I'm itching my weeping.
41899960	41901960	Uh, actually, I'm going to have to thank someone to redirect.
41901960	41903960	Thanks for the second.
41903960	41905960	You guys are going to take me to the worms.
41905960	41907960	We're going to do the worm, go back to the church,
41907960	41909960	and we're going to do it in under 10 minutes,
41909960	41913960	so I have enough time to redirect into, uh, a lovely strumming, okay?
41913960	41915960	Maybe someone from Yumi Plus is on right now.
41915960	41917960	Go ahead.
41917960	41919960	It's tomorrow stream, the last time you play Elden Ring.
41919960	41922960	I don't know when the DLC ends,
41922960	41924960	like, because we're...
41924960	41927960	I'm kind of getting my hand held through, like, everything at the moment.
41927960	41931960	Um, tomorrow I'm going to upgrade weaponry, um...
41931960	41933960	and just keep going.
41933960	41935960	I don't know what we're doing.
41935960	41937960	I've never played the DLC before.
41937960	41939960	But I'm just enjoying it.
41939960	41941960	Like, it's so pretty,
41941960	41943960	and it's so nice, like, being able to enjoy it
41943960	41945960	and not be like, ah, I can't move.
41945960	41947960	What the heck?
41950960	41952960	We'll pick you up later.
41952960	41954960	We'll pick you up later.
41954960	41956960	What the heck?
41957960	41962960	Hello?
41962960	41966960	That just electrified you alive in your metal armor.
41966960	41968960	Oh, my gosh.
41970960	41974960	Why is this game so unforgiven?
41974960	41976960	Oh.
41976960	41978960	Whoa, there's a rolling ram, by the way, by the...
41978960	41980960	You just got annihilated.
41980960	41982960	You poor thing, you.
41982960	41984960	Yeah?
41985960	41987960	Ah.
41987960	41990960	Okay, up in the air is fine, better than, I know.
41992960	41993960	I know a lot.
41993960	41994960	Oh, right, no.
41994960	41995960	Nah, I'm still playing.
41995960	41996960	I doubt we're gonna...
41996960	41999960	I don't know if we're finishing it in 12 hours, though.
42002960	42004960	Um, if we don't finish it,
42004960	42006960	but you guys tell me I'm close,
42006960	42008960	we'll do about, eh, we'll...
42008960	42010960	we'll delete.
42010960	42012960	Can we not go through?
42014960	42016960	Oh, is that a fake down?
42016960	42018960	Oh, it is a fake down.
42018960	42019960	Oh.
42019960	42020960	Um...
42020960	42023960	The Baltral stream was kind of a question mark.
42023960	42025960	Is this actually happening or not?
42025960	42027960	Cause I don't know...
42027960	42029960	How can you guys so...
42029960	42030960	How can you jump so tall?
42030960	42032960	Can't even get up.
42032960	42033960	Breath.
42033960	42034960	Oh.
42034960	42036960	Get down here.
42040960	42042960	Man, I love pretty...
42042960	42043960	Pretty...
42043960	42045960	They should honestly do pretty areas,
42045960	42047960	and I know soul games are supposed to be like,
42047960	42050960	depressing, like, world ending type stuff,
42050960	42052960	but I mean, like, come on,
42052960	42054960	if you're gonna put flowers and deer in the game,
42054960	42056960	like, you know.
42056960	42059960	Well, who was the last boss you fought?
42059960	42063960	Eh, unsuccessfully, the snake guy is the best I've got
42063960	42065960	for his description.
42065960	42067960	Eh, we defeated a sunflower,
42067960	42069960	and...
42069960	42073960	We, like, boxed the crap out of a sunflower,
42073960	42076960	which I actually kind of enjoyed its mechanics.
42076960	42079960	Whoa, sorry, did I just jump into you?
42081960	42083960	Wait, what?
42086960	42088960	Is this granny a weepling boss?
42089960	42091960	No?
42091960	42093960	Weeplings?
42094960	42096960	Huh?
42100960	42103960	Is everyone just DC, or am I really dumb,
42103960	42105960	and I can't follow?
42107960	42108960	They're done?
42108960	42110960	Are we not going this way?
42111960	42112960	There were never any weeplings.
42112960	42114960	Wait, did they jump down?
42114960	42115960	No, they couldn't.
42115960	42117960	Wait, they just...
42118960	42121960	Someone do the hey-a-mo, where are you?
42123960	42124960	Oh.
42124960	42126960	Okay, sorry, I'm here.
42129960	42131960	There's a hand in there.
42131960	42133960	Oh, we are to go down, okay.
42135960	42137960	Okay, sorry, sorry.
42140960	42142960	Don't stream and drive at the same time.
42142960	42144960	And by stream and drive, I mean,
42144960	42146960	Clay, Elden, Ring, and Co.
42152960	42153960	What?
42153960	42155960	You're halfway done, then.
42155960	42157960	Oh, maybe we can't finish it tomorrow.
42164960	42166960	Miss Mer is a halfway point.
42166960	42168960	Is that the guy I can't kill?
42168960	42170960	The one that pulls out his wee eyeball?
42170960	42172960	The one that pulls out his wee eyeball?
42174960	42176960	He's a wee rude one, if that's him.
42179960	42182960	I'm gonna elabel up my sword and get huge for it.
42187960	42189960	Come on.
42191960	42193960	Do we make an error? All the refills here?
42197960	42198960	Oh, no, one fell down.
42198960	42200960	That's what's wrong, one fell down.
42200960	42202960	One fell off and bumped his head.
42204960	42206960	But that's okay, we're gonna get him back.
42206960	42208960	Okay, we got another thing in my bowl.
42210960	42212960	Thank you, Mr. Boo.
42212960	42213960	Oh.
42213960	42215960	That wasn't a good thing.
42215960	42216960	Well.
42216960	42218960	Good is objective.
42218960	42220960	Oh, it wasn't what I thought it was.
42220960	42222960	I thought it was one of them figure things.
42222960	42224960	Oh, we did it!
42224960	42226960	Okay, we're in another finger's room.
42229960	42232960	Is there a leafling here at this grace site?
42233960	42237960	Oh, I can't look, check the map to tell you what grace site is.
42237960	42240960	Have a good night, I'm gonna wake up and listen for it.
42240960	42242960	Oh, you should definitely get some sleep.
42243960	42244960	Alright, here's the last.
42244960	42246960	Gav, I think I...
42248960	42250960	I think Gav is next.
42250960	42252960	And then it's gone.
42254960	42257960	The helmet you're wearing reduces your healing ability.
42257960	42259960	Why would that even be a thing?
42263960	42265960	Let's put this on again.
42266960	42268960	Oh, wait, that's the matching helmet.
42274960	42275960	15 minutes, no?
42275960	42278960	If you have 15 minutes for me to blow this horn.
42279960	42281960	Where is it?
42283960	42285960	Okay, let's try it, let's try it.
42285960	42287960	We're on the clock.
42287960	42289960	We need to perfect this.
42291960	42293960	Surely we can perfect this.
42296960	42298960	Fuck that, keep running, keep running!
42299960	42302960	Keep running, you're gonna get absolutely rolled.
42303960	42305960	If I'm in, they're spawning in.
42308960	42310960	Oh my god, there's more of those worm bastards.
42310960	42313960	We need to stick together for the worm.
42314960	42316960	Just in case one of us gets in trouble.
42317960	42319960	Is the other refling coming?
42320960	42322960	Just be careful.
42325960	42328960	Yeah, be careful, the worms are merciless.
42329960	42331960	Those wiggly worms, they're terrible.
42332960	42336960	We said this like six hours ago, but I guess you are too trashy, Gav.
42338960	42339960	I didn't realize I had the help.
42339960	42342960	I know, someone said like it had something wrong with it.
42342960	42347960	And I think I asked like what it was, and then of course I never read it, but like read every other message.
42347960	42356960	Okay, we're against the worms again, but we can charge, destroy the worms, teach them a lesson, make them regret being born.
42357960	42359960	What are worms?
42360960	42362960	What's their category?
42362960	42374960	Call me Ashley, because I'm Colfin of Andy and Lily.
42376960	42377960	Thank you, thank you.
42378960	42380960	I didn't have time to hit a button.
42386960	42388960	That's where you take it, you take it like a good worm.
42388960	42392960	Oh God, oh God, I'm getting jumped, they're jumping me, they're jumping me.
42396960	42399960	Okay, they didn't quite jump me, but whatever.
42401960	42402960	Okay, we did it, we did it.
42402960	42404960	I got saved from being jumped.
42406960	42408960	Worms and floods are not insects.
42409960	42410960	What are worms?
42413960	42415960	Okay, that one was alright, thank you, thank you.
42416960	42417960	Moment.
42424960	42425960	Okay, we did it.
42426960	42431960	We did it, we're gonna blow it, we're gonna go to the church, and then we're gonna redirect successfully because there's blood blowing up.
42432960	42435960	Okay, Reeflings, thank you so much, please leave, please leave, thank you.
42435960	42436960	Why are you naked?
42436960	42437960	Why are you naked?
42439960	42440960	What the heck?
42441960	42442960	Are you transforming?
42445960	42447960	You can become a dragon?
42450960	42452960	You're like half-dragon then.
42453960	42456960	Okay, I'll very quickly go to the church and talk to this man.
42457960	42458960	Wow.
42465960	42468960	Okay, talk to the man in the church and then I'm done.
42468960	42470960	Is anyone on you need me to flip on?
42471960	42473960	If not, be in you, you're next.
42473960	42477960	Unfortunately, my thoughts don't actually stream on.
42480960	42482960	Hello, I did what you asked for.
42482960	42485960	I'm not really sure what it was, but I did it anyway.
42485960	42486960	Hello.
42488960	42489960	Hi.
42496960	42498960	Thanks for the stream, you're more than welcome.
42498960	42501960	See you tomorrow, same time, same endurance.
42502960	42503960	Is the door still up?
42504960	42506960	Oh, I assume she's all flamed by now.
42520960	42522960	Ruins map, interesting.
42523960	42527960	Yeah, I don't know who's beaten up stuff in here, but it's not me.
42527960	42528960	Okay, we did it.
42528960	42530960	We did a heck of a lot of questions.
42530960	42532960	I hope you guys remember my progress.
42532960	42534960	I have no idea what I've done, what I haven't achieved, what I haven't achieved.
42534960	42536960	Oh, is there still up? Hold on.
42536960	42539960	Let me just message her real quickly.
42539960	42543960	And by message her, go into her live stream and ask if she's still on me.
42544960	42547960	But is there a stream for her?
42547960	42550960	Oh god, she's playing League, no wonder she's a fucking streamer.
42550960	42551960	Dragon?
42552960	42553960	Anyone?
42553960	42557960	Are you streaming streaming for longer?
42557960	42561960	This game is not fucking horrible. This game is weird.
42561960	42562960	Are you left?
42562960	42564960	Oh my god, there's almost 5k.
42564960	42566960	Anybody want to help me?
42566960	42568960	Anybody want to help me get dragon?
42570960	42571960	Anyone?
42575960	42578960	This game is not fucking horrible. This game is weird.
42579960	42580960	Are you left?
42580960	42582960	Oh, coward.
42583960	42586960	Coward, are you streaming for longer? Yes.
42586960	42587960	Okay.
42587960	42588960	I am.
42588960	42589960	You're getting a cheeky wish.
42589960	42590960	I am.
42590960	42591960	You are.
42592960	42595960	I am. You're sending them in here to be tortured?
42595960	42596960	Yeah, exactly.
42598960	42600960	I welcome them with open arms.
42600960	42602960	Are you squidding here, though?
42603960	42607960	Stronny, I love you and I wish I could have stayed the whole stream,
42607960	42609960	but my brain isn't wired to do so.
42609960	42610960	Oh man.
42610960	42612960	Keep up the grind, crazy lady.
42612960	42614960	Oh, I love you too, little reaper.
42614960	42615960	Thank you for the tip.
42615960	42616960	That was very kind of you to say, boy.
42616960	42617960	You heard it.
42617960	42619960	As there is a welcoming...
42619960	42621960	She wants to torture you, but in a nice way.
42621960	42622960	With League of Legends.
42622960	42624960	I have no idea what the game is about.
42624960	42626960	As long as she's happy, I'm happy.
42626960	42628960	She's doing fantastic.
42628960	42630960	I think all the girls are about to hit 5k.
42630960	42631960	You know that.
42631960	42632960	Hold on.
42632960	42633960	Let me check.
42633960	42634960	Hold on to me.
42634960	42635960	Check, ladies and gentlemen.
42635960	42636960	Are you okay?
42636960	42637960	Are you happy?
42637960	42638960	Hold on, let me...
42639960	42640960	Let me see.
42641960	42644960	Most of the ICN is 0 and 4.9k.
42644960	42645960	They're fantastic.
42645960	42647960	They're about to both hit 5k.
42647960	42650960	And then everyone will hit 5k in less than a freaking month.
42650960	42652960	The month isn't even over.
42653960	42654960	Oh my God.
42654960	42656960	Thank you so, so much, little refunds.
42656960	42659960	It has been an absolute pleasure to do it yet again.
42659960	42660960	Another endurance stream.
42660960	42662960	Thank you so much for carrying me.
42662960	42665960	Your advice, your patience through the highs and lows
42665960	42669960	of my energy levels going skyrocket into being quiet
42669960	42672960	to just going nuts and starting to sing so hard.
42672960	42674960	I don't know what I was doing, honestly.
42675960	42678960	Thank you all so much.
42678960	42682960	I will see you tomorrow at the same time.
42682960	42684960	And for more endurance,
42684960	42687960	we may or may not actually finish the DLC.
42687960	42691960	If we do, then the schedule is still confirmed
42691960	42694960	if I have the image of the schedule.
42696960	42700960	Which I will re-show you a question mark, maybe?
42703960	42704960	Is it successful?
42704960	42705960	That would be successful.
42705960	42706960	There we go.
42707960	42709960	So tomorrow is Elden Ring.
42709960	42711960	That counts as the Monday stream.
42712960	42715960	And then at 2pm, no, sorry.
42715960	42718960	It's not adjusted to my time zone.
42718960	42720960	At the normal time,
42720960	42721960	I stream.
42722960	42724960	At the normal time, I stream.
42724960	42725960	It's ASMR.
42725960	42727960	And then 2 hours of ASMR, public.
42727960	42731960	And then a private membership-only script write-in
42731960	42732960	where we do stuff.
42732960	42734960	And if it gets good reception,
42734960	42735960	I'm happy to do more.
42735960	42737960	If it's not really what people are looking for,
42737960	42739960	we'll kind of maybe just do it
42739960	42742960	like in an odd every one, every three weeks or something.
42742960	42745960	And then I have an Among Us collab with Yumi Plus,
42745960	42746960	Veealer versus Yumi Plus.
42746960	42748960	Please don't think we're actually versing each other
42748960	42751960	because it's not possible, because the game is randomized.
42753960	42755960	But if you ever wanted to hear me get angry,
42755960	42758960	because nothing makes me more enraged
42758960	42759960	when I'm telling the truth
42759960	42762960	and someone's like trying to pin something on me,
42762960	42764960	I never get so loud in my life.
42764960	42765960	So look out for that.
42765960	42770960	We are playing Mech Assault, the Xbox original game,
42770960	42773960	which is going to be scaled up beautifully.
42773960	42777960	And then there's going to be a membership ASMR stream as well.
42777960	42783960	Roughly eight hours later, because the estimation,
42783960	42788960	estimation is, is what?
42788960	42791960	Eight hour gameplay time.
42791960	42793960	A very old game.
42793960	42795960	Played it, I say played it.
42795960	42796960	I watched my dad play it.
42796960	42799960	I was probably too young to even fucking hold the controller
42799960	42800960	to be honest.
42800960	42803960	Boutro is a go.
42803960	42804960	And then RuneScape part four,
42804960	42806960	I'm going to release all the thumbnails,
42806960	42808960	which tells you what movies we're watching.
42808960	42811960	But RuneScape part four, we're doing a movie marathon
42811960	42812960	alongside it.
42812960	42814960	And then RuneScape part five,
42814960	42816960	we're doing a Veil or Marathon,
42816960	42819960	because there's so many streams from the girls I want to watch.
42819960	42822960	And what better excuse to shove them in the corner
42822960	42827960	whilst I make wines than doing that.
42827960	42832960	And then to have a wee bit of a shorter ending of the week.
42832960	42836960	We had two hour binding of Isaac Run.
42836960	42843960	And then it's normally one hour per successful run.
42843960	42844960	We're going to do Eden.
42844960	42846960	I don't know if we're going to win or not.
42846960	42849960	And then I actually wanted to watch the original Iron Man.
42849960	42855960	I've not seen it in many a year.
42855960	42859960	And I wanted to see if I sort of remember it being like this.
42859960	42861960	So we're going to watch Iron Man.
42861960	42864960	I don't know if it's a bad taste, but I wanted to try it out.
42864960	42865960	Did you figure out the movies?
42865960	42869960	We're going to do John Wick for the movies.
42869960	42876960	I couldn't find anything else that I was interested in
42876960	42877960	or was in the mood in.
42877960	42880960	I want to watch something that's pretty cool, high action.
42880960	42886960	I'm not really wanting to watch anything that's not really for the masses.
42886960	42887960	So I picked John Wick.
42887960	42890960	I think John Wick is the good balance of everything that I want.
42890960	42893960	Because at one point I was like fast and furious.
42893960	42896960	I'm like they're fast and furious to the moon.
42896960	42899960	Oh no, we're past the 11.55.
