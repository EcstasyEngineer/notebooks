06:57.360 --> 07:02.240
fun those boats mommy I bought your deodorant I can smell like you well the

07:02.240 --> 07:07.560

08:41.080 --> 08:46.080
around with a dude a do-deck a blue deck we're gonna try yellow because it

08:46.080 --> 08:51.200
already gives us such high economy seated run oh I thought it said speed run I

08:51.200 --> 08:56.400
was like sure let's speed run this and but I would tell my dad my dad gets here

08:56.400 --> 08:59.320
in a week so I'm probably just straight up show him that I don't think I said

08:59.320 --> 09:03.040
anything to an appropriate in this room although he doesn't really do shit it

09:03.040 --> 09:15.560

14:52.040 --> 15:00.240
talk about it yeah but I want to tell you everything right three plus multiplier

15:00.240 --> 15:05.800
for every Joker card that's just a straight-up dub first played face so

15:05.840 --> 15:13.320
face or King Queen and Jack first played gives a multi and another one I don't

15:13.320 --> 15:21.080
want to spend too much economy but at the same time I want to go all in I want

15:21.080 --> 15:27.520
to go all in and get because of this Joker card what played car oh it's a

15:27.520 --> 15:33.720
1.5 each King held in the hand gives a multiplier played cards with a heart

15:33.720 --> 15:39.000
suit gives three wins scored and it has an overall multiplier and you come when

15:39.000 --> 15:45.600
you come holy hell both of those are great three of a kind oh are we shaping

15:45.600 --> 15:54.800
our deck yeah I think we're shaping our deck 12 multiplayer if a three of a

15:54.800 --> 16:03.360
kind I think we have shaped our run we do not need what we are who are you

16:03.720 --> 16:12.800
12 multiplayer 1.5 12 if it's a three of a kind and if it has a face on it okay

16:12.800 --> 16:19.440
okay okay well we already have a royal flush which is fine let's go for that

16:19.440 --> 16:32.200
face card yeah fantastic cheese a suit plus three of a kind is that viable not

16:32.240 --> 16:40.080
quite but we're here to do it one plus hand size curious one plus hand size

16:40.080 --> 16:48.520
that would enable us to get our three of a kind more I know this has a chance to

16:48.520 --> 16:52.840
be destroyed I don't want to spend economy now to get destroyed so I'm

16:52.840 --> 16:59.240
gonna buy and then we want to enhance three of a kind I know I'm spending

16:59.240 --> 17:03.880
economy I know I know right three of a kind has now been maxed up so it's also

17:03.880 --> 17:11.000

20:55.040 --> 21:00.360
behave I'll behave okay a mega standard pack I'm not really fussed for that okay

21:00.360 --> 21:03.880
let's see what we've got what's what we've got double evades we've got tons of

21:03.880 --> 21:09.920
doubles I need that half written one I'm sorry there's so many doubles kind of

21:09.920 --> 21:15.000
multiplayer whoa the multiplayer is so counted anyway I don't even need to fish

21:15.000 --> 21:24.080
for triples when blind is selected gain three hands and lose all this hard a

21:24.280 --> 21:27.480
celestial pack

21:28.680 --> 21:33.320
actually here we're it doesn't matter if we spend the four we're only getting

21:33.320 --> 21:37.880
two dollars interest anyway we're getting we're only getting two dollars

21:37.880 --> 21:46.240
DJ and doker and Uranus a straight and a high high card as straight I feel like

21:46.240 --> 21:51.680
might actually come up more than well two pairs is kind of a Hail Mary for us so

21:51.680 --> 22:00.080
I'll go Uranus he's a troublemaker right next round all diamond cards are

22:00.080 --> 22:05.600
debuff that's fine I don't really think that's a problem right we did just

22:05.600 --> 22:13.880
double up pairs a upgrade pair so we're gonna send it and we unlock to Joker

22:13.880 --> 22:19.520
don't mind me don't mind me at all okay and we got our interest that's

22:19.640 --> 22:26.080
fantastic so now what we got foil holographic cars appear twice as often

22:26.080 --> 22:30.760
what are you when small blind or big blind is selected gain a multiplier

22:30.760 --> 22:38.880
destroy a Joker right around Joker we win in the house pack with this one the

22:38.880 --> 22:48.400
Joker gets more money through more hands oops wait what over wait what this one

22:48.400 --> 22:56.960
this one not this Joker oh sorry the last one we ain't gonna live on the

22:56.960 --> 23:00.640
streets the criminal one the one from before all my apologies I was familiar

23:00.640 --> 23:05.040
with it I'm gonna redeem the foil holographic so we're back down to two

23:05.040 --> 23:09.200
economy pair round but that's fine that's fine we're still cooking discard

23:09.200 --> 23:19.600
$1 pair use card what will give you 12 bucks sorry I don't understand if I

23:19.600 --> 23:25.240
don't understand I'm not doing it because it doesn't make sense to me I'm gonna

23:25.240 --> 23:29.440
need this half Joker because let's be honest I'm just playing doubles again

23:29.440 --> 23:36.880
the triples really do not come out to play much a $5 orange net four times

23:36.920 --> 23:46.360
multiplayer every six hands played wait hold on hold on I want rid of you then

23:46.800 --> 23:54.760
four times multiplayer wait five remaining it says remaining it paid you

23:54.760 --> 24:00.560
for every discard this one shit that was a really good one then I apologize I did

24:00.560 --> 24:05.680
not read that properly but look this is why we learning on screen I was wondering

24:05.680 --> 24:09.920
if I should record solo runs of me playing this and upload it as actual

24:09.920 --> 24:14.760
like video content like oh this is the best one I've had but I don't know if

24:14.760 --> 24:22.000
that's weird you can triple to occur so you play so you play five hands with

24:22.000 --> 24:26.480
one times and one oh no okay that's not for me

24:27.440 --> 24:37.680
spectral card spectral card I have no idea what's a spectral card is that the

24:37.680 --> 24:42.960
one where it turns the card gold in that and no that would actually can kill

24:42.960 --> 24:47.920
fee free to make some videos yes some people try it you know what try I will

24:47.920 --> 24:55.720
try it what's going on here creates the planet card for final player poker hand

24:55.720 --> 25:02.600
it's been held okay that's what we'll see create a tarot card if discarded I will

25:02.600 --> 25:07.280
shove a discard because it's easier to discard than have it sitting on your hand

25:07.280 --> 25:14.360
rotten away okay I like it I like it next round let's go what are you three

25:14.360 --> 25:22.480

26:00.920 --> 26:06.960
take it okay we've got nine dollar he does sell this card to disable the current

26:06.960 --> 26:14.280
boss blind wow that's unique each played ten or four gives an extra and for

26:14.280 --> 26:20.480

27:02.880 --> 27:06.640
down the value okay but we're fine we're absolutely fine we are smooth sailing

27:06.640 --> 27:10.560
and before we actually have a successful run as good man and we got live in our

27:11.120 --> 27:17.560
10 multiplier played face cards have a one-in-two chance to give money as well

27:17.560 --> 27:24.880

convert up to three selected cards the space planet cards appear more

27:38.280 --> 27:46.720
frequently in the shop mmm I want to invest in planets if I'm being honest I

27:46.720 --> 27:56.560
think we're gonna need to start doing it before we get in trouble so a flush give

27:56.560 --> 28:02.960

28:02.960 --> 28:12.520

on even though three of a click kind yeah yeah yeah this is should I invest in

28:27.600 --> 28:38.120
planet cards should I should you like Nicki Minaj what that's such a very

28:38.120 --> 28:44.640
specific question what happens do you want me to start rapping this one's for

28:44.640 --> 28:49.840
the boys with a booming system top-down AC with a cooling system when they come

28:49.840 --> 28:54.080
up in the club I'd be blazing up they got stacks on stacks on decks like they

28:54.080 --> 28:58.520
save it up is that what you wanted to hear to be honest

29:01.400 --> 29:05.360
okay I finished my tea I actually finished my tea and I'm hydrated think

29:05.360 --> 29:10.360
of the economy I know it's in shambles because people are paying off their debts

29:10.360 --> 29:16.360
in society is built for you to be indebted and sleep planet cards appear more

29:16.360 --> 29:23.840
frequently played face cards have a chance to give me money

29:23.840 --> 29:35.480
I'll take it you have to tell me twice I'm wondering oh right if I do this I get

29:35.480 --> 29:42.800
$3 if I do this I get $1 in interest which is really greedy but I kind of

29:42.800 --> 29:50.920
want planets or what saved the run I'm sorry but mummy's gambling after

29:50.920 --> 29:58.760
defeating the boss gain 25 extra hmm next-based addition there's a free thing

29:58.760 --> 30:12.160
a extra large blind soon made the strongy man come to bring us reef flings soon

30:12.160 --> 30:17.320
made the strongy man come to bring us reef flings peeing tongue I don't have a

30:17.320 --> 30:21.120
managed to figure out what you were putting there strongy I forgot to

30:21.120 --> 30:24.240
mention that girlfriend also hit different did you like the girlfriend I

30:24.240 --> 30:30.360
thought it was so bad sounded just like her honestly I'm actually Nicki Minaj

30:30.360 --> 30:38.320
for real for real you need to store money because there's a 20k wall and all

30:38.320 --> 30:42.240
that's why I'm trying to invest in planets because the bonus that planets

30:42.240 --> 30:47.280
give is just insane I only have full house and three of a kind levelled up

30:47.280 --> 30:54.720
I'm needing to invest in planets oh I'm needing to invest in planets

30:54.720 --> 31:03.400

31:03.400 --> 31:09.040
money okay you have to tell me twice I'm a good girl I need the money I need the

31:09.040 --> 31:21.440
money I'm wondering that I try and get a fucking what do you do if I play a face

31:21.440 --> 31:26.080
card I have a chance to get money right go for it played face cards have a one

31:26.080 --> 31:33.200
and two chance to give money when scored right give me money now do it yes it

31:33.200 --> 31:38.640
popped we got an extra two dollars let's go let's go it popped it popped I heard

31:38.720 --> 31:45.960
it went okay because of that factor oh we're actually went off from a flush you

31:45.960 --> 31:54.200
know that I really don't want to throw these away but I want to play face

31:54.200 --> 32:07.040
card okay okay okay pop again do it oh we go six doll hairs because so much

32:07.120 --> 32:11.080
bonus wait and the bonus counted because we've reached the bonus so we're

32:11.080 --> 32:19.760
gonna when blind is like to destroy Joker to the right and permanently add

32:19.760 --> 32:28.160
double it's that's a member getting paid please straw me moan quietly I have you

32:28.160 --> 32:33.640
on speakers oh there we go nice and quiet the gulping in the burps made me

32:33.640 --> 32:38.000
think of Emmys Pandario I listened to that for the first time yesterday I was

32:38.000 --> 32:41.400
actually too scared to listen to it and I listened to it and I was like oh wow

32:41.400 --> 32:49.720
I actually don't mind we're losing her to the gambon yeah move the polychrome

32:49.720 --> 32:55.960
Joker to the far right it will give you most mullies in that position see I

32:55.960 --> 33:00.880
don't know how you guys know that but it's so good you guys are so smart right

33:00.920 --> 33:06.480
this is useless we're gonna keep economy keep economy choose one of three

33:06.480 --> 33:15.200
playing cards to add to the deck oh wait hold on what a waste of fucking money

33:15.200 --> 33:26.480
were you next base it becomes a polychrome 1.5 multi what the sigma first

33:26.520 --> 33:33.640
played face card gives to multi I might skip in order to get this 1.5 multi one

33:33.640 --> 33:38.280
because you're starting to you're starting to grind my gears and you're

33:38.280 --> 33:45.240
not really doing too much I can't reroll the boss if I decide to 20k wall is a

33:45.240 --> 33:52.600
risk are you sure I feel like I make so much money I'm like doing this in one

33:52.600 --> 34:00.280
round I have four hands personally played up to purple steak with a few

34:00.280 --> 34:07.200
deck oh do we do it jokers activate left to right yeah if you wanted the audio

34:07.200 --> 34:11.560
it'd be more realistic there'd be a kiss if you need gulp and burping

34:11.560 --> 34:18.800
photograph but can't photograph is kind of weak yeah if you skip you go straight

34:18.840 --> 34:23.360
to the boss though purple steak is doable if you've got the good jokers

34:23.360 --> 34:30.480
you will have to fish for the full house to save the wall shit okay what does it

34:30.480 --> 34:38.440
mean right I'm gonna trade out this for a 1.5 multiplier I can't play my last

34:38.440 --> 34:45.680
town my my last hand so what do you play

34:48.840 --> 34:52.720

40:35.840 --> 40:40.400
roll for a heart though it was risky and it didn't pay off but it's fine because

40:40.400 --> 40:46.280

distribution Philly but hovering much easier I'll hover over your stuff right

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:07.760
not that what are you one plus multiply for each empty Joker slot no that's

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:17.880
terrible maybe at the start of the game but no mega celestial let's go let's go

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:26.240

what the more the odds in this showed up again oh let's see what you look like

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:53.220
now 240 times 13 that's like a big number that's 2000 to 400 and then the

01:05:53.220 --> 01:06:02.200
30 is like an extra what 27 something 2700 something around that area okay

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:07.380
we're gonna grab the turret we love you to have it around here yes we do

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:16.500
convert into space initial cards and booster packs are it's tempting oh no

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:26.100
repeat hands types in the round okay it's not worth it 3k before Joker a

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:33.860
little over 2k yeah last year level the pants okay understood level the pants

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:41.660

sausage and punished me for it why can't I be a silly sausage in peace what

01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:08.380
do you do use to a turret card immediately okay but what happens if we

01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:15.620
did the wheel of fortune on okay an exchange an exchange for wearing a

01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:23.740
plug during a string no I'm joking but what but what if come on use your cards

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:32.300

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:58.740
wheel let's go for it come on I own one stream where I'm full no come on I can't

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:07.060
win it's a one in four Uranus get in here oh my god Uranus is getting out

01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:12.660
control hold on wait two six say by 14 I think this is getting like wildly out

01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:19.140
control this run okay no repeat at hand type so make it count what do you do a

01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:26.460
multiplier while it stays in hand okay so we'll do our first double that's fine

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:30.860
play hands that's fine that's not problem and then we'll see where that break

01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:41.220
takes us up oh we did it we didn't even need to like do anything oh my truth

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:47.980
there's the ROP play cards as a spade now four of a cane not really permanently

01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:54.140

01:08:54.140 --> 01:09:00.020
tarot card I didn't use that again classic me never use my fucking tarot card

01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:17.780
what do you do take select two cards and convert the left into the right I don't

01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:25.140
know what to convert convert the two of heart convert the two of heart into a

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:33.500
steel diamond oh yeah baby and I got 10 for that okay what we're looking at here

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:41.700
well gold card spades double money which would take me up to 28 another steel

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:51.900
card or a wild card some of this temperance turn a second one into a

01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:57.420
steel nope it's gain 20 not double money oh it gives the total cell value

01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:03.420
currently 20 oh that's quite a lot to mess around with and I'll get a lot of

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:11.940
interest I think I'm gonna go with the 20 because then I can get more interest

01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:17.740
because it goes up to 50 my max ceiling is 50 hermit is double the money yes

01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:22.140
temperance and hermit I keep I keep messing up right we'll do money we'll do

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:27.940

01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:20.540
pluses and the times differently and it's not all the same I've just discovered

01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:33.140

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:56.760
mode and see how far we get now I do know endless mode things get out of

01:30:56.760 --> 01:31:00.640
control like so quickly and

01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:10.440
spectral sure I know I spent all my economy we're not try hard and don't

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:18.200
worry we're not try hard and add a foil effect to a selected card convert all

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:23.960
cards into a single random one convert all cards in hand to a single random

01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:35.080
suit sure we'll do we'll do you why not we're not gonna last long in unlimited

that don't think I don't remember how I had you say oh anyway I know exactly how

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:55.400
I say look okay we're gonna do that as well yeah why not

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:59.040
skip blame no there's no playing skip and we'll just play every round but what

01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:04.160
do you do enhances to selected cards to a multi-card sure show views on you to

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:12.480
them multi-card and then look wow yeah

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:21.320

01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:32.160
god he's twitching he's ready oh oh okay let's do this and then you already

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:38.320
know what we're doing I don't even know how high this can go 21 yeah we can get

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:46.200
to 30 before the game ends I don't know that card is rubbing right I'm not

01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:53.280
looking at the skips anymore I don't want okay I see nine

01:32:54.880 --> 01:33:02.640
everything has well I don't know how that worked out but it did oh no I could

01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:08.880
it in a full house and that would have no not two pairs way more effective

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:24.000
oh oh this is the big most insane run ever I'm sorry but hello oh my gosh I

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:30.480
think his urinus is keeping up with the things planet cards appear more

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:34.960
frequently I'm tempted I feel like because we're going all in on doubles

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:39.060
I'm sorry if that was the bad choice I feel like cuz we're going all in on

01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:43.400
doubles all heart cards are debuff does not make a difference to me I sure you

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:50.520
may like it's just one insane

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:59.080

01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:14.880
fives remain and there's only two sixes nine there's a very high chance of a

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:24.360
nine showing up queen can't these are the luck I need the king what's the jack the

01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:34.760

nine there's two more 10 there's two more Jack there's such a high chance of a

01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:25.520
five games trolling you what I would say yeah okay 10 has to go we want the nine

01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:30.240
in hand Jack has to go your debuff

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:47.880

feeling it I'm feeling myself right now shit I never thought that far ahead hold

01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:45.240
on a minute I've I've I've severely didn't think that through and what do

01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:57.160

01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:13.160
that actually worked out really well somehow I don't know how but yeah that

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:21.160
went really well um I'm just gonna keep doing this okay and then we're gonna play all five

01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:31.080
four of a cane yeah I was a bit overkill for that one I'm not gonna lie it worked look it worked

01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:40.680
what defeat the boss blind wait oh 25 dollars I forgot already okay and you're free sell this

01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:50.600

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:58.440
I don't know when this is gonna unlock uh right we're gonna need to start shaping our deck I would

01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:00.120
like to shape it please

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:09.000
doubles all listed probabilities is that good I've not discovered it

01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:14.920
scammed yeah honestly take the blank but yeah

01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:25.880
doubles all listed probabilities I think run a flush deck this time okay let's try flush

01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:34.440
all the same color flush it down the toilet that's how it works three of a cane

01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:39.640
is that what we want

01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:46.680
more just cards it's easier to find a suit okay all the same color

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:50.840
you're starting to get a bit me

01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:54.680
it's free it's free

01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:02.200
flush and three of a kind is very hard to work with flush five my beloved yes sir

01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:11.880
any as long as you call me your little seaweed and then anything for you okay all the same

01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:16.360

01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:31.800
okay

01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:38.760
yeah that's what I thought that's what I thought

01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:49.480
yeah that's what I thought freaking getting trolled you can sort by suit okay I will remember that

01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:58.760
uh don't need tariffs and stuff sorry I would I just want to save my economy I don't know

01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:06.520
I want to get 50 economy I'm not I'm I don't feel very confident about our run I'm being honest

01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:17.640
unless unless unless unless the tarot cards I can start swapping deck to like one deck color

01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:23.560
shit you only get five interest right now anyway

01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:39.960
I guess it's wheel of fortune who do I want to on though like

01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:41.020
me

01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:49.480
please the last tire or planet card use none so it's not gonna do anything

01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:55.480
either stencil or bluish the hanged man destroy

01:51:56.680 --> 01:52:03.880
fuck it the wheel fuck it I love a good gamble oh oh I'm gonna get rid of that if I'm in trouble

01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:14.040
oh well I tried okay let's see what's going on here create two random tarot cards sure

01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:23.720
what we got two planet doubles money sure don't mind if I do create up to two random

01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:32.360
planet cards okay I'm going for a flush I tried doesn't mean I got it but I'll upgrade these just

01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:39.000
in case I find myself in a rough spot when blind is selected destroy joker to the right and

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:45.160
permanently I double itself out I don't get that at first hand of round has only one card no

01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:50.680
okay knife will get stronger both destroying jokers and will enhance stencil

01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:51.260
so

01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:57.880
they won't paramount enhance stencil

01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:03.560
I'm gonna end up leaving stencil behind

01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:13.320
and wait hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on let me think let me think let me think

01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:22.600
if I actually sell these two no they have temples multi oh I can't do math

01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:31.080
oh my head is spinning stencil needs sell yes that's what I'm thinking get rid of stencil

01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:36.360
for better stuff that comes in okay we're getting rid of stencil I'm sorry I'm sorry if it's the wrong

01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:41.720
choice but I want rid of stencil right if it's all the same color flush it down what we got

01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:46.840
we've got three hearts and we've got three jacks

01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:51.560
and the deck is equal as it can be

01:53:57.240 --> 01:54:01.800
oh I need to commit to one color what do you want heart

01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:12.440
think hard think hard me think hard are you joking I'm a dumber okay we got another heart

01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:17.240
okay we got no heart

01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:23.320
finally one two three four five go

01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:34.680
okay that's good that's good we are ahead but we're gonna need to get some juicy upgrades

01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:41.160
what do you do 10 multiplier if you click no uh face face cards give a

01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:46.120
they are not making this one easy really crap

01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:54.120
select two to convert the ray creates a random joker must have room what we do random joker

01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:56.200
our emperor again

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:03.080
I don't know I like doing the wheel just for the hell of it if this flush could grab the wheel

01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:12.680
that'd be great wheel move wrestler in front yes sorry sorry sell stencil fuck you bitch

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:15.800
that's right I'm good at listening

01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:21.400
so stencil can't pick up the wheel okay so I want to sell locador

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:29.560
I'm leaving him to win because if he picks up the wheel again I'm gonna be pissed

01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:34.520
okay no one got the wheel that's fine um

01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:35.900
um

01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:42.040
I honestly I'm needing something to help with these fluffy

01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:50.120
nothing's kind of helping me have pick up smells sure

01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:56.360
wow nothing's really helping me though we're not really getting shaped

01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:01.080
I don't give a fuck oh wait shit I do

01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:12.600
I'm sure I'll hit something fuck that was awful

01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:20.120
fuck it ah right what color diamonds I've got three

01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:31.720
okay did I just lose like so many diamonds in that pack am I going crazy

01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:41.880
so there's hardly any diamonds in the pack that three are on the board that's why and I used to

01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:51.320
oh you know what all these and then go for clubs clubs have a higher chance

01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:58.920
and not clubs the other one no one two three four

01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:07.240
right so I just need one more then oh my god I'm so sorry I'm just joking right it's hard

01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:13.480
couldn't actually you know what we're never doing flush again because we

01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:22.840
right about time go I swear this game loves trolling like it genuinely loves trolling

01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:28.360
okay we got 12 that's good

01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:35.160
played cards with suit gives a fucking three plus no one consumable slot

01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:41.160
this is specific I'll show you my consumable slot I'll have you know adds double the rank

01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:48.040
uh pick that up and go for spade flush spade flush okay

01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:54.840
okay whatever we can say because I'm too dumb to figure out how the freaking flushes work

01:57:55.480 --> 01:57:59.480
the only thing I'll be flushing is myself down the toilet because I remember what I'm playing

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.640
uh actually good hello actually good hello hello hello hello

01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:13.880
hello actually good okay then what are you

01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:20.280
all right as much as you want to find the arena packs and convert the space as much as possible

01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:25.960
literally wow are you oh a tarot card when destroyed

01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:29.480
I'm tempted

01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:38.120
I'm tempted I think the tarot gamble use that and convert it to a spade

01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:44.920
yeah I know exactly one consumable slot this thing up here

01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:50.760
I mean do I need it not really

01:58:53.960 --> 01:59:01.880
maybe if I accidentally redeem the um not the hyrule fan the one that gives to right spade

01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:08.120
and a spade looks like this yeah goodbye everything

01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:16.120
goodbye everything goodbye everything goodbye everything I want a spade card

01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:24.120
spade and spade yeah goodbye okay one two three four five let's go

01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:35.400
not bad but we are gonna need some planetarium upgrades because it's not

01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:41.560
wait wait wait wait I had this splash card in another run is this not op is anything

01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:48.680
is this not op is anything splash isn't great on flush though

01:59:49.640 --> 01:59:58.600
oh no say it's not true hold on hold on say it's not true not good with a flush build

01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:03.080
no how fucking how many times have you guys played this game how do you move so well

02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:12.360
um right okay spade a face card a flush and then I can sell that when I panic

02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:19.000
actually what's ahead of me playing cards played against with that air debuff that's fine

02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:23.560
I I'm gonna be honest I don't think this is a winning run I've maxed out a deck in this game

02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:29.080
and all difficult okay now far too much never played it I have like 60 plus hours that's decent

02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:37.080
you gotta start putting face uh face cards yes that will be very nice

02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:45.320
right my lovely spade you're not spade you're not spade you're spade you're not you're not you are

02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:46.840
goodbye

02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:55.640
can I just do that though

02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:03.880
I know it's not a face card but I think it gives me enough

02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:07.080
hold on let's test it how much does it give me

02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:13.880
oh no oh no that's actually not good

02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:24.680
sorry buy suit yes sorry I said I was gonna do that and then I'm not doing that okay so

02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:29.000
I guess we're better going for clubs now

02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:37.400
I said we're better going for cut loves now thank you

02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:43.320
okay uh I will be admit I don't think I'm that confident

02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:52.120
we have such high economy but we have nothing decent to spend it on right what are you

02:01:53.160 --> 02:01:58.680
15 plus multi not times plus because there's a difference if you didn't know like don't

02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:03.800
worry if you're new to the game don't be embarrassed if you're learning but you know some

02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:10.440
some classic noobs don't know the difference between plus 15 and times multipliers there's

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:18.360
such goofy cubers you know right what are you a flat four multiplier you're just plus four you're

02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:19.560
not times four though

02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:26.440
I don't think we've won this run

02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:34.120
so goofy I know it's okay you don't need to be embarrassed though like it happens

02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:37.640
create a copy of a joker destroys all other jokers oh

02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:40.440
oh

02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:50.600
converse all cards in hand to a single random suit

02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:58.200
there's too many clubs here to sacrifice into something else

02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:01.560
gamble or do you want me to gamble it

02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:05.000
fuck it

02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:11.640
wait is that the right one was that the right one I didn't see it

02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:18.360
oh my god it was the right one

02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:27.640
wait it wasn't wait oh it wasn't it was club sorry they're both the same color so I can hardly see

02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:33.720
the difference oh sorry I get confused between these symbols I feel like they're so similar

02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:38.360
because they both have three points on them like do you know what I mean like point point point

02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:44.440
flat point point point flat like they're the same thing I don't know if that sounds silly but

02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:49.000
they're the same they're different but the same turn on high contrast mode you don't have to tell

02:03:49.000 --> 02:04:00.600
me twice setting and before this is gonna be like so obvious now someone tears okay basically just

02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:09.640
run in black suit flush now okay I mean I might as well just add a random freaking thing yeah

02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:12.600
sure it's not gonna over discard it yeah

02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:23.800
I'm needing I'm needing something better than what we've got I don't I do not believe I'm sorry I don't

02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:32.840
believe I'm so oh it's blue abadi abadi right we have more blues than oh wait so yeah no already

02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:41.000
I don't actually want to discard these too much though ah I don't like this run

02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:46.440
I don't like this run at all

02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:56.200
okay that was incredibly lucky because now we're gonna try and get spades one

02:04:56.200 --> 02:05:02.760
which we are very close to getting a spade flush oh but I don't like this

02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:10.120
discard creates a turret when discarded that's what I want that's what I want to see baby what

02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:16.680
do you do two planet cards fuck it give me it yeah give me a street flush what do you do yeah

02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:20.120
give me a flush that's actually what we needed okay one two three four five

02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:23.400
why do you

02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:39.640
fine then geez why is that so it's so pernicki it doesn't like me oh for gonna see great

02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:45.320
creates a turret card when discarded well you're out what we looking at

02:05:45.640 --> 02:05:48.360
there's actually quite a lot clubs right let's just

02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:55.560
let's just throw everything into the wind what are you enhances multi-card

02:05:56.760 --> 02:05:59.240
unbelievably we actually did it

02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:04.600
and oh wow it removed their debuff as well how interesting

02:06:06.840 --> 02:06:13.800
well that was considerable that Empress came in clutch I think we're gonna have to definitely

02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:20.120
utilize turret cards a bit more re-rolls cost two bucks less well that's rubbish uh no that's rubbish

02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:23.480
we are we are out here

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:32.040
we're doing what's called a flush not a straight a straight's when it's in a roll oh my god

02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:39.320
a straight flush is the best we got like didn't even need Luke Kador I don't know

02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:43.720
that interaction existed thanks for teaching me something what did it what did I do

02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:48.040
you played them earlier that's why they're except okay

02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:55.800
you need jipper or no straight flush is still technically a flush literally none of these options

02:06:55.800 --> 02:07:03.480
right you I don't want you anymore you don't do anything what's the blind anyway

02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:06.520
decrease of level played full for hand well sure sell you

02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:13.240
oh one free re-roll I'll pop them on right now like I don't know

02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:20.120
I don't like it I feel like we're like we're gonna lose and I'm putting on my

02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:25.000
my time and effort and my love wait who has more

02:07:25.960 --> 02:07:32.680
I have more clubs so I'll add another club and you come

02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:40.840
did I re-roll for a better joker fuck earn five bucks for each discarded number three

02:07:44.200 --> 02:07:44.920

02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:54.840
I feel like if we don't do something now we're in so much trouble

02:07:59.480 --> 02:08:07.320

spades I'm happy to turn something into a spade right you can all become spades

02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:53.560
oh someone says wheel no no wheel we need we need to go all in and then I need levels up on

02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:59.320
fucking flushes but the game is refusing to give me a fucking flush

02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:12.520
I swear god if I go for this and his shit I'm gonna be raging I'm gonna be raging

02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:18.360

that oh right okay okay okay okay okay okay okay let me get up let me get up let them get up

02:11:56.120 --> 02:12:00.280
I've only got five hearts left and seven diamonds I can't even

02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:13.800
I need a blue okay literally literally by a ball here we will make this if I get

02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:26.840
and what the sigma I need I need I need speed

02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:32.520
okay that's all you had to do that's all you had to do I think I believe

02:12:36.040 --> 02:12:41.160
wow please let me level up flush this is awful

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:48.040
re-triggered re-triggers all cards played for the next 10 hands

02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:55.400
man I can't take this shit no more we're freaking

02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:01.560
due to your selling the dude early the boss's auntie still applies

02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:09.240
no flush and only log you just unlabeled flush I mean it's free

02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:31.640
this is the worst I think we've ever had flush finally took you long enough to show up don't

02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:38.040
be shy to show up again I'm gonna need a permanent hand if we want to even have a slim chance of

02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:46.360
winning right who is my most I've got clubs give me more club and club club money or club

02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:51.960
sitting in the hand if it sits in the hand it's a lot more valuable

02:13:53.640 --> 02:14:00.360
we're just splashed it's splash it's splash terrible pick up the voucher it's basically

02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:06.680
a lifeline yes I actually agree uh do we want oh my god sorry if I go bug bite on my leg

02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:08.680
refling what if you just bit me

02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:15.000
reflames did one of you just bite me on my juicy thighs what's going on

02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:23.880
all right okay splash does nothing sorry splash is good if your hand doesn't have less than five

02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:29.560
cards okay it was me no I thought I literally just thought bug bite that's probably the only

02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:34.280
scary thing no fuck off I don't believe it's gonna be any good Ardua

02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:39.320
oh my god I think I'm gonna have to double skip

02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:48.680
I need I'm like struggling to win but if I can have three hands in a round without having to discard

02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:55.480
oh fuck it fuck it we're we're hardly gonna win so let's just go bigger go home

02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:57.480
um

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:05.880
gee willikers I wonder what that card is hmm it's a mystery well good luck I sure hope I don't mess

02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:10.600
this one up okay I love sorting by suit okay

02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:14.280
okay

02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:21.640
there's so little hearts in the deck you guys are not worth having around

02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:31.320
diamonds again you're rare but we're only one off oh I wonder what that one is

02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:38.600
chucks the game almost got me I don't think I'm gonna make it maybe

02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:43.480
right if I hold you in my hand I'll hold you

02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:56.680
oh wow I actually did it holy crap that paid off I don't know how about I did

02:15:57.640 --> 02:15:59.160
okay right what is my joker

02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:09.480
wait hold on copies the joker ability to the right hold on hold on hold on hold on

02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:15.320
right you're about to perish anyway

02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:28.840
what do you do speed okay yeah blueprint but with what

02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:39.080
I think blueprint and then joker and then get rid of photograph

02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:43.560
and that's gonna expire naturally which is fine

02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:51.320
so get rid of joker because he only does it once

02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:59.560
first played face card gives the times two multi win scoring I get that it's big but

02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:10.600
yeah just get rid of photograph okay sell you copies the ability the joker to the right so buy

02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:22.680
you put you here and then sell spritz because it's gonna expire anyway I understand I just get rid

02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:32.360
of straight joker um what crafty joker you want rid of him it is only 80 chips if it's a flush

02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:42.120
yeah no I'm um what do I need to sacrifice I feel like that's gonna expire so there's no

02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:43.320
point in keeping it around

02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:49.320
mmm the 80 chips

02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:59.880
I feel like you're doing nothing bro I do right so copies the ability to the right and it's compatible

02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:10.920
so it's giving me 15 multi plus 10 multi for an extra 25 multi flush isn't worth it yeah

02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:20.840
have blueprint next to seltzer for now okay I will agree with that and then when it perishes

02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:31.960
we will move it in front of him rip chips stop have a mess up please give me joker oh my god this

02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:32.760
game hates me

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:43.640
none of these are useful for me right now unfortunately well I'll go with planet earth

02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:49.800
because why not right we're gonna do playing card because I want to keep adding to my clubs

02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:50.600
basically

02:18:55.800 --> 02:19:02.520
yes please get in that it so we're 22 clubs 18 space only 10 hearts and 10 diamonds

02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:10.600
definitely want to start getting tarot cards that override these hearts and diamonds would be best

02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:11.320
honestly

02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:19.000
what do you do no fuck off you rubbish offer

02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:23.160
whoa okay you you you you you go

02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:38.920
that was a lot of movement for me not comprehending create a tarot card when discarded

02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:47.000
okay so diamonds and hearts you're out because you guys I don't have enough of you what do you do

02:19:47.640 --> 02:19:54.440
enhances something into a steel card I mean sure just sit right there I doesn't really matter

02:19:55.880 --> 02:19:58.120
like I can still get a value out of it than I

02:20:00.120 --> 02:20:04.920
oh wait I put it should have put it on a lower one sorry sorry sorry it's fine it's fine it's fine

02:20:04.920 --> 02:20:11.240
okay okay okay okay okay maybe we've recovered a little bit if we can get a few jippers to get

02:20:11.240 --> 02:20:14.040
more stupor uh

02:20:18.280 --> 02:20:21.880
I know I should try and keep economy I know

02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:31.640
I know right please jipper is all I ask thank god and it is a flush all the same color

02:20:32.520 --> 02:20:38.760
it's all the same color flush it down the toilet okay and then we're gonna add

02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:44.680
uh another club from this pack that we're a hundred percent gonna get

02:20:50.280 --> 02:20:57.240
oh no I mean the odds of a the tarot card is so valuable though I know that gives 50 chips

02:21:02.280 --> 02:21:05.320
hmm what do you say

02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:12.840
DNA can help you make some face cut boil is a good one because you want to play the clubs I know

02:21:13.800 --> 02:21:16.600
the tarot card might just save my arse cheeks you're right

02:21:19.320 --> 02:21:25.240
can I see if I wait oh right okay now uh if first hand on round only has one card

02:21:25.240 --> 02:21:30.120
our dependent copy to deck and draw it that's a joker

02:21:31.880 --> 02:21:36.280
another time another time we'll come back to you we'll come back to you another time right you

02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:42.920
enhance two cards into a lucky card I mean I can do that for literally anyone sorry I keep

02:21:42.920 --> 02:21:51.720
forgetting it's clubs blue okay so we can get rid of these because we can't have them

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
okay that was lucky ish

02:21:58.360 --> 02:22:02.520
I definitely want to eliminate any hearts and diamonds at this point

02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:08.600
if I can get a tarot card to bless us spritzer little spritzers getting a bit weak now

02:22:09.560 --> 02:22:13.000
right one two three four five what do you do

02:22:15.160 --> 02:22:20.360
I'll keep you for now I'll see if my lucky cards pop off

02:22:25.640 --> 02:22:27.560
okay could be worse

02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:36.520
create a tarot card when discarded okay against my best interest what do you do

02:22:37.240 --> 02:22:38.440
say

02:22:40.760 --> 02:22:45.960
okay whatever whatever right we're gonna have to do these unfortunately

02:22:47.320 --> 02:22:51.720
I'll pop that in the oh wait I can't pop wait can I pop it in the shop I think I can't pop it

02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:57.640
oh I'm getting nervous when we spritzer goes away though because it's ogre

02:22:58.040 --> 02:23:07.800
no I'm need I'm needing jupiter's like I'm needing jupiter's bad that's what's gonna resurrect this

02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:14.520
you can use it in shop okay that's good doubling money doubling money but actually this time not

02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:25.640
scamming yay right what's going on here not you not you your ship I ask I pray I ask for jupiter

02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:27.560
to get more stupider

02:23:31.880 --> 02:23:38.600
I am being troll and that's okay jupiter I call upon you

02:23:39.800 --> 02:23:46.600
no thank goodness gravy I am desperate I am on my hands and knees jupiter what are we looking at

02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:49.640
not full house flush

02:23:56.440 --> 02:24:03.080
oh we're literally have more in full house I can do it again right sure straight three of a cane

02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:12.840
straight flush is the best I got next round I don't have the economy to be messing around how many

02:24:13.880 --> 02:24:15.640
oh no he's about to break

02:24:16.040 --> 02:24:26.760
full house is giving more than flush honestly because it's cheeky bad pause

02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:30.120
yes it's just worth more

02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:39.640
lose a dollar per car plate that's fine our economy's bad anyway does it mean oh we're

02:24:39.640 --> 02:24:42.760
gonna keep that in hand hopefully one two three four five go

02:24:46.600 --> 02:24:53.320
I took five bucks from me am I gonna go in debt I thought this was a fantasy game why is

02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:59.640
they putting realistic aspects into gamble give me my money back what are you doing

02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:06.840
give me that shit back great let's get rid of these give me my money back

02:25:07.720 --> 02:25:14.360
what the heck is realistic okay now move blueprint to the left

02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:25.560
so blueprint abstract and then if I play a face card and if I play a spade it's just

02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:32.280
can we play cards when we run out of money I don't know I'm going to discard the tarot

02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:39.880
because I want to see if it gives me a tree I gave me a tree literally taxes

02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:47.640
literally got tax playing a freaking a gamble game thank you boy for the tip literally what the

02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:57.160
heck right I want to keep that ace I want to keep the ace very badly because it's giving me a

02:25:57.160 --> 02:26:03.960
multiplier here we go right 10 10 9 7 5 go have fun do something

02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:22.600
I don't like that no the chances of me rolling another club is high I'm sorry I'm going to

02:26:22.600 --> 02:26:29.640
have to sacrifice the ace I'm sorry I have to sacrifice the ace I didn't want to

02:26:30.600 --> 02:26:37.000
no we lost we actually lost for realsies though the fuck do you do

02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:46.840
no we actually I knew it I knew it freaking

02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:54.680
as I have clubs clubs I need clubs

02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:57.800
oh my god

02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:08.520
not good not good

02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:18.120
no wow that was so rough that was like a terrible don't play the scene

02:27:18.120 --> 02:27:22.280
whatever you do don't play the scene you know what they say the house always wins

02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:27.800
yeah you were freaking making sure I was losing that was terrible honestly

02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:31.480
create a tarot card when blame just like this okay

02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:39.640
I see you little card oh I was actually minus money as well that's quite funny

02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:45.640
just so you know strong either it's a joker you unlock after you get three wild cards in your

02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:51.480
deck that make your hearts and diamonds count as one suit the same for cotton space oh okay

02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:58.920
right is there any easier deck at the end um these all look really hard okay sorry these

02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:05.000
all look too hard let's just keep doing one extra discard we just need a joker to be kind to us okay

02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:15.960
I'm here for it that's useless um right okay I can see a bit better now because of the different

02:28:15.960 --> 02:28:22.440
clothes okay everything we remember throw out the window because

02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:33.240
uh because I said so smile would I need a king a king and then we have a flush

02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:44.120
fine doubles then jeez I just want to get the joker that's in the shop waiting for me

02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:50.440
oh and there's the king yeah yeah yeah up my arse what does it say yeah um

02:28:53.240 --> 02:28:56.680
I don't have a particularly high chance of rolling a flush

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:05.080
but might as well might as well go for it

02:29:05.160 --> 02:29:14.120
I see this game see this game how dare this game make me so addicted to it but absolutely

02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:22.120
clueless on what to do honestly right I can't believe I'm actually doing maths in a freaking

02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:26.200
video game right just get rid of the lower number sorry I'm not counting fuck that how dare this game

02:29:26.200 --> 02:29:32.920
make me actually use my brain honestly it has nothing but the cheek and the audacity to make

02:29:32.920 --> 02:29:39.240
me use my brain all right we've got a full house surely full house will do it oh god

02:29:40.840 --> 02:29:46.280
okay thank goodness right what's my real joker uh right

02:29:49.160 --> 02:29:55.560
uncommon jokers give a multiplier right you know what's crazy I don't have any

02:29:56.200 --> 02:30:06.600
right do we spend right we're only going to get one dollar interest anyway so we might as well go

02:30:06.600 --> 02:30:15.880
for it uncommon uncommon and they're both common why because why wouldn't they be I'm losing it when

02:30:15.880 --> 02:30:25.640
blind is selected to create two common jokers 12 three of a kind okay are we already shaping our

02:30:25.640 --> 02:30:37.000
decks any deck shapers I'm shaping mine right now three of a kind three of a kind you'll never

02:30:37.080 --> 02:30:41.160
guess what I got and a full house let's go three of a kind give me a baby

02:30:45.080 --> 02:30:51.400

02:30:52.680 --> 02:31:00.120
which is good okay and we've got clearance sale to lower the price of everything

02:31:00.120 --> 02:31:07.400
oh if I do that I can only buy one pack

02:31:11.240 --> 02:31:15.800
if mmm because you got free jokers you could just sell them I don't

02:31:19.080 --> 02:31:27.480
if I get more rare that 1.5 gets out of control pretty quickly right what's the deal

02:31:30.920 --> 02:31:40.360
okay this stays so if I keep my economy

02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:48.360
I will get two dollars interest and then I'll buy it next round I'll keep my economy

02:31:49.480 --> 02:31:52.600
oh you skipped the first yeah spectral is worth it usually

02:31:52.600 --> 02:31:58.920
I only get one dollar interest if I go for it though I might as well just

02:31:59.960 --> 02:32:09.960
fuck it go for it spend all create a random rare joker but sets money to zero you'll never

02:32:09.960 --> 02:32:17.880

02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:45.640
obelisk is dying is it I'm so sorry obelisk I'm not even paying attention to you I don't

02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:50.280
like it because I can't like comprehend it strength is nice if you use it on 10

02:40:51.080 --> 02:40:59.160
that's a brutal five of spades literally get money or a 50 foil as well

02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:04.360
that wait that thing's stacked it's got the circle on it the gold and a seal

02:41:05.160 --> 02:41:11.080
when I saw the bellel voucher I read that it's something totally different what balanese

02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:17.000
if you have a blue seal at the end it's a free planet creates a planet card for final play

02:41:18.840 --> 02:41:24.600
sell the first joker and obelisk what for it wouldn't aid me would it

02:41:25.320 --> 02:41:27.240
want bat and just roll for a new joker

02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:35.880
yeah yeah yeah okay wait if I just start I don't want to tire it I want to plan it

02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:42.600
okay obelisk I agree with selling she still has a joker slot oh have multiple

02:41:46.840 --> 02:41:51.800
you know what fuck you I literally don't have one uncommon

02:41:55.560 --> 02:41:57.960
I'm going out on three of a cane

02:41:58.200 --> 02:42:06.040
the two pairs can re-roll buy that and then re-roll

02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:13.720
this joker gains two plus multiplier for every real roll in the shop well good thing I have

02:42:13.720 --> 02:42:19.480
freaking economy are you joking is that a joke is that real

02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:25.720
go for full house yeah

02:42:28.520 --> 02:42:36.360
that's bizarre and it's uncommon right so you finally compliment you you mean bam

02:42:38.200 --> 02:42:44.280
and then what you two are like card and then what are you just a random thing and you're random as well

02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:51.240
you need to be at the end though so it's like active and then you

02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:54.600
sell two pairs and buy a new joker

02:42:54.760 --> 02:43:01.480
sell two pair and buy a new joker and now sell the first joker

02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:04.440
Gigi should be at the end

02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:14.760
why sell two pair yeah because my triple will get counted in a two pair if I do full house angle as well

02:43:14.920 --> 02:43:25.320
fill house will trigger both of those yes that I re-roll to get a multi activity

02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:31.880
I mean one re-roll can't hurt yeah he literally got it well

02:43:33.880 --> 02:43:37.720
four of a cane no hi hi no

02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:44.600
um yeah this is another rough looking one I'm gonna be honest

02:43:48.680 --> 02:43:51.480
oh wait did I just fuck up did I just fuck up

02:43:57.160 --> 02:44:04.040
I hope I didn't mess up no okay right so you're gonna activate when a double goes

02:44:04.040 --> 02:44:06.760
you are gonna help you

02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:16.040
I see aces so get rid of all of this oh I'm so close to a flush

02:44:18.840 --> 02:44:22.520
honestly four of a kind apart you have to sell some jokers in New York yeah

02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:31.160
right two pair three of a kind so I need a right I need to fill house

02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:36.920
how am I so proud of this girl can I get a king or an ace please

02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:46.760
I'm just gonna have to play something

02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:52.200
two pair go for it and the ace should trigger on that at least

02:44:52.600 --> 02:45:03.880
what do you do oh piss it's always too late increases the rank of up to two cards by one

02:45:06.760 --> 02:45:14.600
right so I'm gonna make some nine some tens I know I suck you don't have to tell me

02:45:15.560 --> 02:45:24.040
it's silly compare up to three selective cards to clubs sure let's make everything clubs

02:45:24.040 --> 02:45:29.400
like it makes a difference to this point I can do a flush if I want to

02:45:30.840 --> 02:45:36.360
uh just do two pairs again for how strong are you better than giving to me I'm getting

02:45:36.360 --> 02:45:42.840
rolled and is this deck is like so hard for no reason hold on I want a double

02:45:49.000 --> 02:46:00.600
there's more three four and six and eight can go three four six and eight can go and then I can get

02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:14.040
I know for a fact I'm reading these odds correctly and being trolled out the wazoo

02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:24.200
I know I am reading these correctly and can get a full house I am being trolled so hard

02:46:24.200 --> 02:46:32.120
with odds right now holy holy holy holy holy holy right eight can get to fuck

02:46:32.520 --> 02:46:34.920
six can get to fuck

02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:41.640
I can I'm getting trolled so bad looking at the odds honestly

02:46:45.880 --> 02:46:50.600
well where are you when your room begins add a random playing card with a random

02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:58.920
feel to your hand well that's kind of cool four of a kind I don't really have that choose a joker

02:47:02.440 --> 02:47:04.920
well it's gonna have to be better than anything I've got on my persons

02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:11.320
every played card counts in scoring

02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:19.960
gain 15 chips if it's a straight times four multi if played hand contains four of a kind

02:47:19.960 --> 02:47:29.160
that's so rare I don't have any played it it's an uncommon the rare you want splash

02:47:29.160 --> 02:47:35.240
is splash good with my current thing baseball jokers like having a laugh at me just sell them

02:47:41.640 --> 02:47:50.280
no wait splash is bad oh the one in the shop is uncommon my apologies okay just skip these

02:47:50.680 --> 02:48:03.400
I don't think I'm going to get rid of what eight chips or 12 plus

02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:17.880
what one sell the two of a kind pair two of a kind okay I'll take your advice

02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:24.040
and you come right so now you are giving me multiplier for that as well when round begins

02:48:24.040 --> 02:48:32.280
add a random playing card with a random seal in your hand or or a seal in in your hand more likely

02:48:32.280 --> 02:48:41.000
than you think okay add a playing card make it good make it a tarot or something oh right

02:48:41.080 --> 02:48:47.400
we roll so I can boost him boom right what do you do a joker a tarot a planet and a

02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:54.760
spectral card may appear multiple times what does that mean this joker gains three plus

02:48:54.760 --> 02:48:59.640
chips paired discarded club card new card with a seal

02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:10.120
two parts is in the Fibonacci sequence he's better than scholar is he I mean I'll take

02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:16.840
him he's uncommon so he's gonna hit with him fuck you scholar and you come you

02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:27.640
we now have 1.5345 and then six times six multiplier because of all these guys

02:49:28.840 --> 02:49:32.680
surely that's how it works surely I'm gonna re-roll again to give him a little boost

02:49:33.640 --> 02:49:40.440
I know I shouldn't but each played queen of diamond gives a two times malt that's a bit much

02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:46.680
I mean you could get like multiple of the baseball jokers yeah I feel like a bit of that

02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:51.640
that was like a dog and not a seal or or wait moose

02:49:55.720 --> 02:50:01.640
am I good pup for you so many uncommon literally that's uncommon as well

02:50:03.560 --> 02:50:11.160
that one's far too specific though yeah what do you mean my seal sound isn't good or

02:50:11.160 --> 02:50:19.720
or you know you you buy upgrade high card by three levels well I'm not playing high far

02:50:20.440 --> 02:50:28.120
first hand is drawn face down that's fine well why did you shake when discarded

02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:38.200
I've got three discarded not discard me I don't really want to discard these either

02:50:41.400 --> 02:50:44.680
you're always good to stand straight right discard for attire

02:50:46.280 --> 02:50:55.320
the lovers into a wild card oh my god it's so wild why is the card wild we'll never know

02:50:55.320 --> 02:50:57.320
I want to keep that 10 because of that the thing

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:03.560
uh what the fuck am I supposed to play three of a kind

02:51:11.560 --> 02:51:15.560
okay

02:51:16.120 --> 02:51:23.560
three of a kind speed and then holy shit that's it that's all I can do

02:51:25.800 --> 02:51:34.200
I mean it did something something was popping off I don't I don't exactly know what but it was

02:51:34.200 --> 02:51:40.360
pop a lock and choose playing cards or choose playing cards

02:51:44.040 --> 02:51:50.120
cool house I live for the wild I do love a dapper moustache

02:51:50.520 --> 02:51:54.680
noodles yes you are a good little seaweed I love that fucking nickname

02:51:54.680 --> 02:51:59.080
let's just get a little seaweed tell you I'm a little seaweed I'll be flowing in the water

02:51:59.080 --> 02:52:01.960
sell the first joker and reroll for an uncommon really

02:52:06.760 --> 02:52:12.920
fuck it give me an uncommon shit

02:52:13.240 --> 02:52:24.120
I would have to completely change up my plan I think it's too late to change a strategy like that

02:52:29.560 --> 02:52:31.720
is it too late for fancy pants

02:52:34.520 --> 02:52:39.240
it's trusors nope it's worth it trusors works with a full house

02:52:39.320 --> 02:52:47.720
right uncommon uncommon uncommon and I can't get rid of that guy because he lets me hold

02:52:47.720 --> 02:52:52.520
the or everyone um

02:52:56.760 --> 02:52:59.160
put the pants first sorry I always forget that part

02:52:59.720 --> 02:53:09.960
uh 7.5 on uncommon isn't bad maybe if we can swap to the two pair angle it's not too bad I

02:53:11.400 --> 02:53:12.120
I'm gonna buy

02:53:14.600 --> 02:53:15.800
right what are we looking at

02:53:20.200 --> 02:53:21.640
chance to win money though

02:53:22.440 --> 02:53:30.920
chance to win money or double the point I feel like money because when we reroll

02:53:30.920 --> 02:53:37.080
this little guy's getting stronger every time we're gonna next round it first hand is drawn

02:53:37.080 --> 02:53:46.360
face down that's fine uh unless that one isn't so we know by rank that we've got pretty low batch

02:53:46.360 --> 02:53:52.440
of cards I have four attempts to get 10k

02:53:54.920 --> 02:54:00.600
hmm don't buy so many cards a slung deck is more reliable

02:54:06.280 --> 02:54:12.520
wait no fuck it hey we got a double in there

02:54:13.320 --> 02:54:16.680
okay oh that was such a waste I'm sorry

02:54:26.120 --> 02:54:26.920
I've done it now

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:34.200
I've done it now

02:54:34.520 --> 02:54:44.120
okay I have a lot of 10s I don't have a lot of 9s 8s I'm waiting on showing up 3 and 2 you

02:54:51.800 --> 02:54:59.560
7 and 3 you can both perish 10 uh 8th and jack I mean I don't want you to perish but

02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:10.280

strats I have fancy pants I need to do him oh I'm so sorry

02:55:35.160 --> 02:55:40.280
I don't need triples I need doubles we're going back on the doubles wow I have one discard

02:55:43.160 --> 02:55:47.400
uh ace I've got rid of too many you too I've got rid of many

02:55:47.400 --> 02:55:51.000
five I'm very likely to show up nine and ten

02:55:51.800 --> 02:55:57.000
and queen all equally oh fuck this is a terrible truck oh I paid off though

02:55:58.600 --> 02:56:04.200
wait no I didn't yes I did I tell the lie go doubles go multiply do your thing

02:56:07.080 --> 02:56:11.000
wow right must remember fancy pants I have fancy pants now

02:56:12.040 --> 02:56:16.920
are you guys okay if I go get a snack after we lose this one I need a wee snack

02:56:17.640 --> 02:56:24.840
full house was also an option was it okay no was it full house oh yeah yeah yeah

02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:31.000
full house would activate two pair anyway okay another uncapped well we can't really

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:36.280
change up anything uh sell this card to create a free double card I don't know what that is

02:56:37.240 --> 02:56:40.280
uh no I need the rounds when blind is like no

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:46.120
turret card oh please oh please what's two pair I've forgotten

02:56:48.200 --> 02:56:54.200
oh Uranus in you come we're doing two pair strategy we might be able to do it in time

02:56:55.960 --> 02:57:06.520
to save the run to swap now would I need delete spades that I don't think anything happens spades

02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:15.800
maybe turn turn stuff into spades fuck it turn stuff into spades sure everything comes spades

02:57:19.880 --> 02:57:25.800
we're gonna reroll to increase our little buddy there add one stone to deck when blind is selected

02:57:25.800 --> 02:57:29.800
one and two chance to create a turret card when any booster pack is open

02:57:29.800 --> 02:57:39.960
wow that seems pretty OP but I would lose out on something

02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:50.920
yeah I would lose out on a multiplier it's good at the start it's too late now okay agreed agreed

02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:58.760
um I'm gonna reroll no I'm not I'm gonna go next shit okay what are you initial cards and

02:57:58.760 --> 02:58:09.960

eight do I want eight eight your odds are up ten your odds are not as high as eight

02:59:03.320 --> 02:59:08.760

03:03:17.560 --> 03:03:26.280
wait no geez that almost oh I don't really want to use it but if it means I can level up my things

03:03:26.280 --> 03:03:34.600
then keep the space this isn't actually a very good discard range

03:03:35.400 --> 03:03:38.600
you need to keep and not use the other five delete the other lows

03:03:40.280 --> 03:03:41.400
well delete that one

03:03:43.800 --> 03:03:48.360

03:15:06.040 --> 03:15:08.280
discard two random cards every time you play a

03:15:11.160 --> 03:15:13.240
