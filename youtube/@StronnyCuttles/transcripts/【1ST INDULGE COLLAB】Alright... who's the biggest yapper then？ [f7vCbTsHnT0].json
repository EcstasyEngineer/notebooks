know if she's gonna make it i don't know i'm like dad going to zura for her cringiest memory all right zura don't know either i don't know i mean i can do my we can start in a different order well wait all right how about she be first then we'll go from she's like oh my god all right i'm a sucker for pain as well as dishing it out so i'll start with my cringiest memory every night i lay awake because once when i was a little girl playing tag as a wee bun as a we lost as uh strawney would say yeah we were uh playing tag we're running around and my friend goes to tag me and we're just standing there and i just full on piss my pants mind you i was like above like the age for that i was like 13 you know at that age you think you and you call me a bed wetter my mom had to come pick me up oh that's bring me pants she was so mad at me she was so mad my mom is also a very important ceo bunny and she had a lot of stuff to do come pick up a little piss pants stop you know that's me that's why i don't wear underwear anymore i mean hey you just let it slide down my way okay and me mark my territory okay okay okay my cringiest memory was uh when i was like around five years old my dad would always pester me about getting a boyfriend he would always be like oh your friend your friend ashley has a boyfriend why don't you have a boyfriend and so one day he asked me again and i got really really fed up so obviously i didn't have a boyfriend so what i told him he asked me again like oh do you have a boyfriend in me i said the name of the only boy that both me and my dad knew and do you want to know whose name i said who i said what was my boyfriend your brother i said my cousin's name i told my dad i was dating my cousin kastin a little too good over here what the heck mersey my cringiest moment my entire life is a cringe oh so it's hard to pick out one so i guess my most cringiest moment i can think of is like oh i really was tuney like real tuney back in like middle school and elementary school i would refer to myself as like third person and then i would be like yes yes i can control the wind oh i can control the wind and i was born in a family of like i don't remember what i fucking said i think i was like you know it was like a phoenix a phoenix angels or something i was so cringe hell yeah azura oh no i relate a lot to mersey just kidding sorry oh no look all right hear me out all right i'm sure everyone has a moment when they were a kid you know i used to pretend to be an animal and i would run around on all floors in an empty park oh that's normal for a kid yeah but some kids my school caught me oh no it's all right i barked at people okay i think i think i can finally speak now okay so my uh cringiest and most embarrassing memory is when i was in elementary school at the end of the year we had like this uh thing where we did a lot of different dances and everyone's parents would show up to like a big like area to see that so we would practice the dances and stuff and i was like so confident and sure that like i remember my dance moves and everything and so we're all like sitting down uh and there is like a certain like specific part in the song when we need to get up and like start the actual dance mm so the music starts and then you see me the only one who gets up to a fucking early and starts dancing and then i realize that it's too fucking early and i'm just looking at everyone around me it's so fucking embarrassing like and like slowly sitting back no this little sit down of defeat yeah it was so embarrassing well let's see if i can beat all of their cringe stories lads so i've always been uh sleeping during the day and up during the night and i had a dentist appointment i was incredibly delirious because of the time it was at was actually in my bedtime and if you didn't know the tongue is an exploratory muscle that you have so for around 15 minutes while i'm getting my teeth cleaned i essentially used i was really tired okay to be fair but i essentially sucked and licked on this old man's fingers at my dentist and i didn't even realize i did it until i got home because i was so delirious so this per man was like trying to oh he liked that no he was like trying to help me get my teeth clean he was like oh yeah no everything looks good and i'm just like like it haunts me to this day so that that's my reduced memory no he totally liked that he jorked off to that later right right right right on a more positive note how about we share what happy memories you have any any happy memory it doesn't matter what it is well we start with ac this time and work our way back up okay um my happiest memory is from when i was a child and basically my grandpa had this summer house that he had built and my grandma and grandpa they had like a small farm in that house and so we would go there a lot of times so that happy memory happens there because there's this one time when me my mom and my grandma we went to sit on the tall grass outside and it was very cloudy and my mom was like reading like a book story to me and then it started raining so we went inside and i remember just my mom like making me tea and my grandma getting some fresh strawberries that she picked up and giving it to me and just you know the nice scenery of the rain and the clouds while meeting like fresh strawberries looking at my Barbie magazines just i don't know there's something about that memory that is like the happiest i've ever felt in my entire life really so beautiful that's so my uh-huh has there well uh well last year my my cat did pass away um but my happiest memories were of us chasing each other around the house uh i'd play you know hide and seek with him i'd hide and he'd look for me and sometimes he'd also hide and wait to scare me and then we'd later duke it out my cat is the same memory um i guess when i was a kid um mama and papa would uh we we didn't have a lot so the most distinct memory is of me receiving my first gift from them um which was a vhs a vhs uh movie of pokemon the first movie and i was so happy because that was the first time i've ever realized like what gifts were you know all day oh okay well a happy memory of mine is um i used to have this rat called medkip uh she died a couple months ago but um she was my oldest living rat and she lived for almost three years and that's really long for a rat they they don't live long so before she died i took her outside of the house on a walk to the park and she stayed on my shoulder the whole time and and we just sat um on the grass at the park and we watched the sunset together oh that's so precious and i carried her in my sweater on the way home and she pooped all in my sweater um so as i mentioned in my debut i really love fantasy and um when i was younger my grandparents took me to a renaissance fair and i got to dress up as like a little little renaissance girl little princess and when i went they had the joust and i was selected to give my favor to this lady knight and so she won her joust and then i got to give her a little like favor on her um lance and i just felt like all of my dreams had come true like i was a part of a fairy tale it was just i loved it so much it was so wholesome uh for my happy memory um so my dad takes me game shopping as a child it's all childhood all of us were like childhood childhood um so i couldn't read at the time like i was very young so i would go to the game shop with my dad and look at the covers on the games and then present it to him and then he would judge if the game was worthy enough for me to play or not so it was like some judgment of like um is this quality enough for strawney a player or not um but it also led me to getting into a lot of like cooler games that i wouldn't have had access to like mech assault or halo these kind of games so i'm very thankful for my dad um it's just like such a goofy little memory of being like please dad can i get this game and be like no no that's not good enough for you strawney okay and then that's adorable now we do need chat participation for this next one okay we're playing two truths and a lie chat do you think you're able to detect a lie from these girls hmm yeah hmm we'll find out we'll find out so you know what i'm gonna start this game i need to need to open up chat so i can do a little thing okay and then oh my hypnosis is on it shouldn't be on stop it it's not hypnosis sometimes i'm getting sleepy against my will my poor babies are so tired right okay i will do

this person came in and they're like i'm definitely allergic to red onion oh my that's fine we don't serve anything uh turns out we did and i served it to her and basically her instincts kicked in when she smelled what i served and then my boss came over and basically look all i'm saying if you're deathly allergic to something don't show up to to a freaking cafe it just stresses us out okay
