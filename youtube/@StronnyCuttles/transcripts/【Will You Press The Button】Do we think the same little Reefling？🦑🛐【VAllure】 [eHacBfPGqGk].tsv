0	5000	This? Okay.
5000	8000	Wow.
8000	15000	Me prancing and going sick.
15000	20000	Where are my wheels?
20000	24000	That was a stretch.
24000	28000	That was like a random dinosaur noise I wanted to make.
28000	32000	Hi. Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.
32000	36000	Turns out I can actually be a lot louder than I first anticipated.
36000	41000	My dad had no idea I streamed.
41000	45000	So I finished the stream and I went back down.
45000	47000	And I got off again.
47000	50000	And obviously he was off at that point.
50000	54000	And I was like, oh yeah, no, I enjoyed my stream.
54000	56000	Sadly I was motion sick.
56000	59000	And he was like, huh?
59000	60000	He streamed.
60000	61000	And I'm like, yeah, you didn't hear me.
61000	63000	I was like having a carry on and stuff.
63000	65000	But apparently he never heard nothing.
65000	70000	So, well, I guess I can be a hell of a lot louder.
70000	74000	And I will because yesterday I was like, I was ill as anything though.
74000	75000	Thank you for understanding.
75000	80000	I was so freaking ill.
80000	83000	Yes, we're going to play this little silly goofy thing.
83000	85000	It's called will you press the button?
85000	90000	Basically, apparently it gives you scenarios and either you press it or not.
90000	98000	And then it'll give you statistical percentages of who pressed it and who didn't.
98000	100000	Is he a heavy sleeper?
100000	111000	Yes, I thought because of the flight he basically passed out for ages.
111000	117000	But yeah, we went to the shops and we got food.
117000	122000	He was so mad at me for the food that I had in my fridge or the lack thereof.
122000	124000	He was pissed.
124000	128000	And I showed him the short that I made of Sheebie.
128000	130000	So on my channel there's a short.
130000	135000	And I'm like, if I had a willy, I know that Sheebie's design is a 10 out of 10.
135000	137000	And I showed it to him.
137000	143000	And he was like, oh, I didn't want to hear you talking about a willy.
143000	148000	And I was like, damn, Papa Cuttle said no to food.
148000	151000	Which is absolutely mean and both funny.
151000	153000	But I showed him Amy's rats.
153000	155000	I was like, all right, this is Amy.
155000	158000	She has rats and they're adorable.
158000	160000	And he found them quite funny.
160000	163000	Esteban is his favorite rat for yanking all this stuff.
163000	166000	Because there's a one point like Amy's doing something.
166000	168000	And I think it's the burger one.
168000	172000	And he's like, OK, we have a burger here and then Esteban yanks it.
172000	175000	And she's like, we have half a burger.
180000	182000	Please tell your dad to try and force you to enjoy.
182000	184000	Oh, but he's cooking me steak.
184000	189000	We went to the shops and he's like, right, you're eating better.
189000	190000	What do you need?
190000	192000	And I was like, well, I kind of need a steak, I guess.
193000	195000	And we've got chicken to marinate overnight.
195000	197000	I've never marinated a chicken before.
197000	199000	That sounds like a marinate chicken.
199000	201000	Like, no, I've not got time to marinate chicken
201000	203000	and put it in a Ziploc bag.
203000	206000	I had to buy Ziploc bags for the first time.
206000	208000	I was like, what do I even need these for?
210000	212000	The less he knows the better.
212000	214000	Oh, no, he finds it hilarious what I do.
214000	216000	Oh, my hell, yeah.
217000	218000	Marinate.
218000	220000	It's good to see you having a good time with your dad.
220000	221000	Yeah.
221000	225000	I was telling him about how you guys call him father-in-law.
225000	232000	And he was like, oh, I don't know if he's going to write a letter for me to say on stream.
232000	235000	I'll see if he wants to do it.
235000	237000	He mentioned leaving you as a message.
237000	239000	And I was like, do you mean like a physical one?
239000	240000	Or like, what do you mean?
240000	242000	Like, I need to take down the transcript.
244000	246000	But he was like, no, no, I'll write.
246000	248000	Oh, he approves of you guys.
248000	250000	Oh, he approves of you all right.
252000	257000	I was basically like, oh, so they're called Reflings.
259000	262000	Because he still says Radish Boys, which is an old name.
262000	265000	But yes, he's definitely three weeks of real food.
265000	266000	Your body isn't going to know it.
266000	269000	Literally, I'm going to have so many bill movements.
269000	271000	But yes, today's just a chill stream.
271000	273000	I'm just meming away.
273000	278000	We're going to enjoy just, just chatting, doing our thing.
278000	280000	There's no major rush for anything.
280000	282000	And I believe Sheebie is on today.
282000	283000	So we'll redirect into her.
283000	284000	It's nice and chill.
284000	287000	And then I'm going back to Charlotte.
289000	291000	He's going to invite us for a mission next week.
291000	294000	Oh, my dad's know the camping tape.
294000	297000	Just say, what is my dad?
299000	300000	Maybe I'll walk.
300000	302000	Maybe a bit of the foodie.
302000	305000	She's doing a member streamer for a regular streamer.
305000	308000	Okay, well, someone else is getting redirected, isn't it?
308000	310000	And it's not Sheebie.
310000	312000	I'm sure there's someone we can find.
312000	315000	I need to buy some more bait and tackle.
317000	319000	What's this gamer tag?
319000	321000	Oh, my God.
323000	327000	Oh, he was talking to me about gaming because I was telling him,
327000	329000	like, oh, I got to play cameo again.
329000	331000	And he was like, you know what?
331000	333000	Cameo was hitting my dad's got stronger accent.
333000	336000	So he's like, oh, by the Pope.
336000	339000	Mama, I vanquished a possum last night for you.
339000	342000	He lived by the saying, you are what you eat.
342000	344000	And he was eating roadkill.
344000	345000	Strong enough.
345000	347000	Are you kidding me right now?
347000	348000	Oh, you eat?
348000	349000	Wait, you killed a possum?
349000	350000	I'm glad to hear he approves,
350000	353000	but I'm going to work so not going to be interacting for now.
353000	355000	Oh, don't worry if you have to work.
355000	356000	Enjoy work.
356000	357000	Make sure you hydrate.
357000	359000	Thank you, Broly Legend for the tit.
359000	361000	Orvon Biscotti.
361000	363000	Thank you for the super chat.
363000	365000	You killed a possum?
365000	367000	You didn't have to perish him.
367000	369000	He was just freaking doing it.
369000	372000	Papa Cuddles is going to get stream sniped, honestly.
372000	373000	Nah.
373000	378000	Are possum bad in America?
378000	380000	You're not supposed to perish the wildlife.
380000	382000	You're supposed to feed it.
382000	386000	I had, I fed the birds yesterday.
386000	387000	Wah.
387000	388000	I kid you not.
388000	392000	There must have been a hundred birds in that garden.
392000	394000	Listen, during work.
394000	397000	Well, I'm not going to be acting up too much, so you probably can.
397000	400000	This is probably the most say so I'm going to be for the next three weeks.
400000	401000	Although I do have bad news.
401000	404000	I don't think I can do that ASMR stream.
404000	406000	That's planned tomorrow.
406000	411000	I don't think I can actually do any ASMR stream for three weeks.
411000	416000	I can literally hear the walls reverberating right now from my dad snoring.
416000	422000	So yeah, I really don't want my dad's fart while he sleeps memorized.
422000	424000	Clipped and shipped.
424000	427000	As hilarious as that would be.
427000	429000	That's rather weird to explain.
429000	432000	Like, oh, dad, by the way.
432000	437000	Someone clipped your fart whilst I was like streaming ASMR.
437000	440000	Yeah, I don't really want that to go down in history.
440000	444000	So I think we're going to pause on ASMR for three weeks.
444000	445000	I know how boring.
445000	448000	Oh, and the complete sabotage.
449000	453000	But obviously I will make it up when my dad goes.
453000	456000	I will keep you up to date when we're going to do it.
456000	457000	It's all good.
457000	460000	But seriously, okay, if you can't do it, it must have been the wind.
460000	468000	Honestly, the freaking walls are vibrating from how intense his snoring is.
468000	470000	Old man fart ASMR.
470000	473000	Honestly, imagine me try to be all cute in that.
473000	477000	And then you just hear like meh in the background like, okay, you're done.
477000	480000	Make sure you hide all your figures well.
480000	483000	Oh, I fucking made sure that was done.
485000	488000	The perfect set up for don't wake up appearance.
488000	489000	My dear sibling ace.
489000	493000	Hey, yo, you thinking like a pin pal here?
495000	499000	Chill three weeks and then endurance marathon after marathon after marathon.
499000	500000	Yeah, pretty much that's the plan.
500000	501000	It all looks good to me.
501000	507000	Well, surely that was a lot of stuff that even the thought of it is like, oh, no.
510000	512000	I'm having me cup of tea.
516000	518000	Wait, you need to try and be cute.
518000	522000	Well, so whenever I do like ASMR, I feel a lot of pressure.
522000	526000	Actually, like when I do it live, I don't know how to explain it.
526000	529000	I don't get like stage fright or anything.
529000	533000	But I feel like with ASMR, I can't really be my goblino self.
533000	537000	It normally does end up me just straight up talking to you by the end of it.
537000	542000	But I feel like I have to try and choose my words carefully to not ruin the ambiance
542000	544000	or what's going on type thing.
544000	545000	I'm not a pin pal.
545000	546000	I'm loyal to my mate.
546000	547000	Okay, I'm sorry.
547000	548000	I'm sorry.
548000	550000	I never doubted you for a second.
553000	554000	What?
554000	557000	ASMR, your Scottish girlfriend brought you to meet her parents
557000	560000	and she's trying to relax you while her dad snores louder than a motorcycle on the net.
560000	562000	No, because it's true.
562000	563000	It's actually true.
563000	566000	Like, I was gonna play Ring Fit next week.
566000	568000	Next week, I'm playing a lot of Nintendo games
568000	571000	because I found my Ildeado.
573000	574000	I'm gonna...
574000	579000	I don't know what kind of choke hold that Sakuya game,
579000	582000	the fruit game on Nintendo has on VTubers,
582000	585000	but I'm joining the ranks and seeing what that game's all about.
585000	587000	I swear to God, if I'm about to spend,
587000	589000	I don't know how much it costs,
589000	593000	if I'm about to spend a ridiculous amount of money on this little Nintendo fruit game
593000	596000	and it's absolutely the most piss-borne thing I've ever played,
596000	600000	all VTubers unanimously are getting bent over my knee and spanked
600000	603000	because you all make that game look so addicting.
603000	606000	Everyone in their nan was playing that game
606000	608000	and you all made it look so addicting.
608000	611000	So I swear, I swear.
612000	615000	If I pay three quid, three whole quid,
615000	618000	someone says in that game's piss,
618000	620000	everyone's getting spanked.
620000	622000	Everyone unanimously, okay?
622000	625000	Johnny's 100% getting addicted to it as much as Belchro.
625000	628000	Is that actually becoming a VTuber right now?
628000	631000	Okay, I'll spank the VTubers,
631000	634000	but I'll ink you guys from behind
634000	637000	if it was you guys that said that it was a good game, okay?
638000	641000	I never got the sucker hype.
641000	643000	I don't even know how to say it.
648000	650000	Three quid to US dollar.
650000	652000	I don't, er, fucking six dollars.
652000	655000	I think, well, the old conversion rate was great,
655000	657000	British pounds to dollars was two,
657000	660000	the other way about one to two.
660000	662000	I always said it like,
663000	666000	Get that watermelon.
666000	668000	Aye, so we're going to play that next week.
668000	671000	The Streams Dave game's going to be Mario Kart.
671000	673000	Who goes there? Identify yourself.
673000	676000	And then I was going to do Ring Fit as well
676000	678000	because I need some exercise.
678000	680000	I walked to the shops with my dad.
680000	682000	Motherfucker, I was telling him to slow down
682000	684000	and I'm like, fucking hell, I'm a gamer.
684000	686000	You need to relax, dad.
686000	688000	Like, relax, I'm in no rush.
688000	690000	I got to show my magpies
690000	693000	and there's also a crow I am now feeding.
693000	695000	So I got to show him that and he was like,
695000	697000	oh, damn, that crow's pretty badass.
697000	699000	And I'm like, yeah, me and dad both have the bird autism.
699000	701000	We're like, yeah, birds are cool.
701000	704000	I'm like, yeah, yeah.
704000	706000	Honestly, we're the same damn person.
706000	709000	We were like, watch Star Trek last night
709000	712000	and I have something very adorable.
712000	714000	I'm going to cry if I think about it too much.
714000	718000	My mom found my childhood toy
718000	720000	and I'm going to take a picture and you can all see it.
720000	724000	It needs a big wash, but his name is Charlie
724000	727000	and he's a wee monkey and I absolutely adore him.
727000	733000	So, yeah, I was like, oh, did you bring me any books?
733000	735000	Because last time my dad visited me,
735000	737000	he brought me books all my family.
737000	740000	I asked my family, like, oh, if you have any favourite books,
740000	743000	please just give them to my dad and he'll give them to me.
743000	745000	And he was like, no, sorry, no books this time.
745000	747000	And I'm like, oh, no, that's fine, that's fine, don't worry about it.
747000	750000	And then he's like, oh, but there is one thing though.
750000	752000	And he whips out Charlie from behind them
752000	755000	and I was like, you know if I wasn't so violently motion sick,
755000	758000	I'll right now, I would burst out in tears.
758000	762000	I have not seen my childhood Teddy since I was about 12 or something.
762000	767000	And I sent my mom a text and I was like, you found Charlie
767000	770000	and she's not replied to me yet, but oh my God,
770000	773000	I've got my childhood toy and I love them to smithereens.
773000	778000	And I remember he's got a little toy, he's got a speaker in him
778000	782000	and he goes, because he's a monkey.
782000	785000	They love monkeys. I love gorillas.
785000	790000	Shout out to any viewer named Charlie right now, literally.
790000	793000	Charlie's not a cat. Charlie's a monkey.
793000	795000	Return to monkey.
795000	798000	But I'll take a little photo of him
798000	801000	and I can show you my childhood toy.
802000	806000	Maybe someone from the UK might have a Charlie too.
806000	807000	It's Charlie on your bed.
807000	812000	No, I have to put Charlie away in case Gimli and Vigil destroy him.
812000	815000	I don't want any trouble. I don't want any trouble.
817000	820000	My uncle did a funny, he gave me a toy monkey as a kid
820000	822000	and told me his name was Spank.
822000	825000	You guys spank the monkey.
825000	827000	Oh wait, no, that's, you guys taught me,
827000	830000	that doesn't mean what I think it means.
830000	834000	Monka? Monka? Are you okay?
834000	837000	I feel that passing down a childhood bear to my kid.
837000	840000	Oh, honestly, I'm so happy with Charlie.
840000	842000	I was like, honestly, if I didn't feel so violently sick,
842000	844000	I would have burst out crying there.
847000	849000	Yes, I remember what it means though,
849000	851000	but I forgot what I meant yesterday.
851000	853000	I'm sorry, I didn't know.
853000	855000	I didn't know any better.
855000	857000	Okay, great.
857000	860000	I actually played this game before I end up just turning into a rant,
860000	863000	a rant, a ramble about everything and anything.
863000	865000	Pardon me, boys.
865000	867000	Right.
867000	874000	Oh, I can also make that short about how much money I earn.
874000	877000	I was explaining to my dad, like, oh,
877000	880000	I'm going to make this short because I'm showing him what,
880000	881000	he knows what YouTube shorts are,
881000	884000	but I was just showing him like, oh, because I'm a,
884000	888000	I was like, all right, you're getting dusted upon the world of VTubers,
888000	890000	and I showed him like Rin Penrose's stuff,
890000	892000	and I was like, see how it's all like insider knowledge.
892000	894000	Like, people are genuinely interested in the ins and outs
894000	896000	of like, how being a VTuber is.
896000	900000	And I was saying to him, like, I'm going to show my income for the month,
900000	901000	and he was like, is that wise?
901000	903000	Like, aren't people going to think you're bragging?
903000	905000	And I'm like, no, it's not for bragging.
905000	910000	It's to show like, this is how much you, you know, you can earn.
910000	913000	Fucking put your head down and, you know,
913000	915000	work your booty off type thing.
915000	918000	And I was like, a lot of it is also, you have to remember,
918000	922000	YouTube generates like free money when people watch VODs back
922000	924000	and the ASMR videos, for example.
924000	926000	But anyway, shut the fuck up, Johnny.
926000	927000	No one cares.
929000	932000	You'll get a short soon about how much I earned in my first month of it all.
934000	936000	I've a Gen 2 update.
937000	939000	Five.
942000	945000	One of them is a very unique design.
948000	950000	A female concept artist.
950000	956000	The chick concept artist is giving me her batch by August 1st.
956000	959000	We've just received the second one from her.
959000	963000	And we are looking fucking solid.
963000	964000	That's all I'm saying.
964000	967000	Sorry, I just sucked my finger because I opened up a can of cola.
967000	969000	But five designs have been...
969000	971000	What is going on with my cola?
971000	973000	Is there all exploding recently?
978000	979000	Unique in a good way?
979000	980000	Oh, unique in a good way.
982000	986000	I don't think there's like absolutely nothing where someone's like,
986000	988000	this person looks like this person.
988000	989000	No, get to fuck.
989000	991000	And then two, there's no one that's got the same bloody lore.
991000	992000	I can tell you that much.
992000	994000	Coca-Cola for Gen 3.
995000	999000	Although the concept artist was fucking pranking me, man.
999000	1001000	It goes horse.
1001000	1003000	I'm like, no, absolutely not.
1003000	1004000	And it goes unicorn.
1004000	1006000	No, absolutely not.
1006000	1009000	Do not fucking turn around and give me a bloody unicorn.
1009000	1012000	I swear, God, I was getting raging.
1015000	1018000	But the female concept artist, she's giving me too.
1019000	1021000	I look very adorable.
1021000	1022000	I'm just waiting.
1022000	1025000	No, no fucking horse confirmed.
1025000	1026000	No horse, no unicorn.
1026000	1027000	Donkey.
1027000	1030000	Mule, you guys are such trolls.
1030000	1032000	I'll spoil a stream that's coming up.
1032000	1036000	I'm drawing your shitty suggestions for Gen 2 live on MS Paint.
1036000	1041000	We're doing that not next week, but the week after the first one.
1041000	1046000	So you guys can literally write what you want and I'm going to draw it live.
1047000	1049000	And then I'll show you what your line-up's going to look like.
1049000	1051000	I'm going to take a screenshot.
1051000	1054000	And then next year, when they actually come out, I'm going to be like,
1054000	1056000	hmm, I wonder whose suggestions were better.
1056000	1057000	Mine are yours.
1057000	1059000	Who goes there?
1059000	1060000	Pegasus.
1060000	1062000	Oh, no.
1062000	1066000	But show me a roly-poly vetiver.
1066000	1069000	She's going to draw a million slime girls.
1069000	1072000	Honestly, I'm going to be like, what color do you want the slime girl?
1072000	1074000	Pick a color.
1075000	1076000	Emu.
1076000	1077000	Emu.
1077000	1080000	She'd have to be Aussie if it was an Emu.
1082000	1083000	We get to comment on your drawing.
1083000	1085000	Oh, you can annihilate my drawing skills.
1085000	1086000	I don't have any.
1086000	1090000	Literally, the title of the stream is like drawing Gen 2 suggestions,
1090000	1092000	but I never learned to draw.
1092000	1094000	I never put those down.
1094000	1096000	Although that would be a fun idea.
1096000	1099000	All the other girls have like fucking capabilities to doodle or doosh it.
1099000	1101000	I'm going to have to tell them like,
1101000	1105000	hey, go have some fun streams.
1105000	1108000	Emu couldn't be Aussie after the war.
1108000	1109000	Cephalopod.
1109000	1111000	Vetiver when?
1113000	1116000	Kangaroo girl on Alpaca.
1116000	1118000	And Alpaca, no.
1118000	1120000	Right, when we actually do this,
1120000	1122000	the whole reason we're here today,
1122000	1124000	your doodles are cute.
1124000	1126000	Did you like the DEMPA birthday card on Twitter?
1126000	1128000	Oh my god, I can be a real streamer.
1128000	1130000	Please remember to like and subscribe,
1130000	1133000	even though I've not done the thing I said I was going to do.
1133000	1134000	Smile.
1134000	1135000	A honey badger.
1135000	1137000	Honey badger, don't give up.
1137000	1139000	Giraffe with that long neck?
1139000	1140000	Absolutely not.
1140000	1144000	Okay, you can change your physical appearance in any way at any time,
1144000	1146000	including swapping genders,
1146000	1150000	but you will never be able to look the same way twice.
1150000	1153000	I feel like that is like so minuscule.
1153000	1154000	Like it could be like, yeah,
1154000	1156000	I want an extra freckle on my butt cheek.
1156000	1158000	Like, I feel like that's so minuscule,
1158000	1160000	it's not even necessary.
1160000	1162000	I'd press, yeah, I'd press the crap out of that.
1162000	1164000	Do you know how much money I could make on only fans
1164000	1166000	with this ability?
1168000	1171000	Literally, I'm pressing the shit out of that.
1172000	1178000	Yeah, I was, I think these people have overthunk it by far.
1178000	1180000	27% have overthunk it.
1180000	1182000	Literally, you could be like, yeah,
1182000	1184000	I want a freckle in between my toes.
1184000	1186000	That's different, okay?
1186000	1188000	They played themselves.
1188000	1190000	Okay?
1193000	1196000	100% would press, no brainer.
1196000	1200000	This could be exploited to basically rule the world.
1200000	1203000	You have the ability to cure cancer with touch,
1203000	1205000	but you will die of cancer.
1205000	1208000	See, now, there's no...
1208000	1209000	Oh my god, I can...
1209000	1211000	Oh my god, that's a white one, guys.
1211000	1213000	I can open them up.
1214000	1216000	So, it says you'll die of cancer,
1216000	1218000	but it doesn't give a timeline.
1218000	1219000	And I'm not being funny.
1219000	1221000	Odds are, you actually do perish from cancer
1221000	1222000	the older you get.
1222000	1224000	Other than Alzheimer's.
1224000	1226000	Alzheimer's will fucking grab your brain
1226000	1228000	and shake it real good and make it full of protein
1228000	1231000	so it doesn't function and you stop eating, basically.
1232000	1235000	Yeah, see, because it doesn't specify die immediately,
1235000	1238000	I'm like, I could probably get a good solid 80 years
1238000	1242000	on this planet before the microplastics just annihilate me.
1243000	1247000	Until it's over for me and all the lead and the clothes and that.
1249000	1253000	I think sacrifice for the gain of others as well
1253000	1255000	is quite a noble thing.
1255000	1259000	Like, you know, my life is never going to amount to anything,
1259000	1262000	so if I could just cut about in the hospitals for a bit,
1262000	1265000	sure, fuck it, press that shit.
1266000	1270000	Oh wow, 40% said no.
1273000	1275000	St. Strawny, let him know.
1277000	1278000	Whatever comforts you, okay?
1278000	1280000	Whatever comforts you.
1283000	1286000	Altruistic question.
1286000	1288000	Cure everyone else but die a few years later.
1288000	1292000	Yeah, I feel like, because my life ain't going to be, you know,
1292000	1295000	about on general modification.
1295000	1299000	Delicious lead and microplastic lunchables.
1299000	1301000	Okay, sandy clothes is real.
1301000	1305000	Every other holiday, you know, never get celebrated again.
1305000	1308000	If, okay, that's definitely not the dad's up,
1308000	1310000	I guess I'll open them up.
1310000	1313000	I mean, like, oh, my dad sleeps through everything.
1313000	1315000	My dad who's literally slamming the cupboards right now.
1315000	1317000	Okay, Santa Claus is real,
1317000	1320000	but every other holiday, you know, does they get celebrated?
1320000	1322000	What are their other holidays?
1322000	1325000	Valentine's Day, you could be romantic any day of the week
1325000	1327000	to me, Refland.
1327000	1330000	Santa spawns capitalistic.
1330000	1336000	Santa Claus is actually just a capitalistic front
1336000	1339000	to part with more of your money and put yourself in debt
1339000	1341000	to the credit card companies.
1341000	1343000	I will not press that button.
1343000	1345000	Fuck you.
1346000	1348000	Damn straight.
1348000	1350000	That's right, my people rise up.
1350000	1354000	We identify against the capitalist pigs of society.
1354000	1356000	How dare you?
1357000	1360000	Okay, all food tastes twice as good,
1360000	1363000	but you're permanently constipated.
1363000	1366000	Oh, no. Wait a minute.
1366000	1369000	I really like food though.
1369000	1373000	Oh, no.
1373000	1380000	Did I get to relieve myself with my booty?
1380000	1384000	My wee douche, my wee pot douche?
1384000	1387000	No, it's not worth it. I mean, you're always constipated anyway.
1387000	1391000	Yeah, I was going to say, like, I mean,
1391000	1393000	this is literally me right now.
1393000	1397000	I really enjoy food, so I think I already have enhanced taste points.
1397000	1400000	And then, like, if ever, you know, get constipated,
1400000	1403000	I'm just like, oh, just squish some water on my boot.
1403000	1405000	That's as simple as.
1405000	1407000	Time to break out the colossal thing.
1407000	1411000	Wait, don't you just implode you would die out of the food?
1411000	1413000	I don't think I need it, actually.
1413000	1415000	I think food's already enhanced for me.
1415000	1417000	I will not. I will refrain, because I don't want to be full.
1417000	1418000	Oh, wow. Okay.
1418000	1420000	74% agreed.
1420000	1422000	Mmm.
1422000	1424000	Damn straight.
1424000	1427000	You save the world and make it a better place,
1427000	1431000	but you go down in history as a bad person?
1431000	1434000	I mean,
1434000	1438000	if you save the world and make it a better place,
1438000	1442000	again, this is the nation and good of the people,
1442000	1445000	but if you go down as a bad person in history,
1445000	1448000	I mean, think of how much history gets lost to time.
1448000	1452000	Like, name one fact in the 1300s.
1452000	1455000	Go. Like, you cannae off the top of your head.
1455000	1459000	History continues to develop,
1459000	1462000	and people are forgotten, and that's just how life is.
1462000	1464000	It's not a big deal to be forgotten,
1464000	1466000	and if you're remembered as a bad person,
1466000	1467000	guess what?
1467000	1469000	Every time someone dies,
1469000	1471000	the percentage of people that know you and are aware of you
1471000	1474000	are just so unlikely.
1474000	1476000	You know?
1476000	1479000	So don't worry about being remembered as a baddie, okay?
1479000	1482000	Save the planet, my final message.
1482000	1484000	Goodbye.
1484000	1486000	Will you press the button?
1486000	1488000	You will get super ability to read minds.
1488000	1491000	I can already do that with the reeflings.
1491000	1494000	If you read their mind for too long,
1494000	1496000	they know you're doing it.
1496000	1498000	Are you joking me? That's the best thing ever.
1498000	1500000	Can you know how much torment I can do with you?
1500000	1503000	I'd be like, I know what you're thinking, reefling.
1503000	1504000	And then you know that.
1504000	1507000	You know that I know that you're thinking of certain things.
1507000	1508000	How is that any bad?
1508000	1510000	That's not bad at all.
1510000	1511000	That is not bad.
1511000	1515000	Literally, whoever said 16%, come on.
1515000	1519000	Imagine how red your face is gonna go.
1519000	1520000	You're gonna be blushing.
1520000	1523000	You're gonna be blushing.
1523000	1525000	You're just gonna love every second of it.
1525000	1527000	Mommy, please, I can't right now.
1527000	1529000	Can you control when you do it?
1529000	1532000	If so, 100% yeah.
1532000	1534000	Oh, hydration check.
1534000	1536000	I'm getting, getting, getting.
1536000	1538000	Oh.
1538000	1541000	I agree that some people's thinking my ball,
1541000	1543000	but I would never stop thinking with things.
1543000	1545000	What they're gonna do is stop thinking exactly.
1545000	1548000	Although apparently guys can like zone out really easily.
1548000	1550000	So maybe you just need to like zone out.
1550000	1552000	And I'm like, damn, I can't get nothing off of you.
1553000	1554000	I'd use that against you.
1554000	1555000	I could make,
1555000	1557000	I could think of things that would make you blush.
1557000	1558000	Okay, no, I'm here for it.
1558000	1561000	I'm here for that kind of reverse psychology.
1561000	1563000	You can perfectly torment someone
1563000	1565000	because you know what their picture in.
1565000	1568000	I'm zoning out right now.
1568000	1572000	I just started thinking of me.
1572000	1573000	Sorry, I'm dumb.
1573000	1575000	You can't get anything from my mind.
1575000	1576000	Oh, yeah.
1576000	1578000	Ah, yes, or nothing box.
1578000	1581000	Being empty-headed is just male superiority.
1581000	1584000	My strongest skill versus strong disassociation.
1584000	1587000	I cast this association.
1587000	1588000	Okay.
1588000	1590000	Everyone in your family would be taking care of
1590000	1591000	for the rest of their lives,
1591000	1593000	but you will be homeless for the rest of your lives.
1593000	1595000	I have terrible news for you,
1595000	1597000	but already take care of my family.
1597000	1601000	I will not press that button.
1601000	1603000	The fam are good.
1603000	1605000	Yeah, I was gonna say that's quite a high percentage.
1605000	1607000	I mean, I guess you could get around it
1607000	1609000	and being like Colin, you can be homeless.
1609000	1613000	You can never own a house under your legal name
1613000	1615000	if you want to get technical like that.
1615000	1617000	But already look after the fam,
1617000	1619000	so that was a much of a thing.
1619000	1622000	Homeless, no mad lifestyle in a van.
1622000	1623000	I've seen that.
1623000	1625000	The rise of people living in a van.
1625000	1627000	I've seen that.
1627000	1629000	I've seen a few tech talks about it
1629000	1632000	and they're like, van life is good for me and all of that.
1632000	1635000	Yeah, homeless doesn't necessarily mean it in a house.
1635000	1637000	I agree, I agree.
1637000	1638000	Yeah.
1638000	1641000	And like obviously you have the freedom to bop about in that van
1641000	1643000	and you didn't have to pay like property taxes
1643000	1645000	or nothing on that bad boy
1645000	1647000	because you're living in a van.
1647000	1649000	I don't know how you get mail though.
1649000	1651000	Like if you need mail.
1651000	1652000	Okay.
1652000	1658000	You can bring any musician from the dead for one last show.
1658000	1662000	You won't be able to see and hear it.
1662000	1666000	I mean, if it's something for people to enjoy,
1666000	1669000	I don't always have to enjoy everything myself.
1669000	1672000	I can appreciate other people enjoying it.
1672000	1673000	You know?
1673000	1676000	If someone wants big beef oven to come out of the ground,
1676000	1677000	go for it.
1677000	1678000	You know?
1678000	1681000	I'm not going to ruin the night for someone else
1681000	1683000	just because I can't even get the goods of it.
1683000	1684000	Like relax.
1684000	1685000	Why would you say no?
1685000	1687000	There's literally no downside.
1687000	1689000	I mean, you could sync up on,
1689000	1691000	like literally you can have headphones in
1691000	1695000	and sync up the music to what it's supposed to be.
1695000	1696000	Relax.
1696000	1698000	Why is everyone so selfish?
1698000	1699000	That's a shame.
1699000	1701000	Imagine they off themselves and they were forced,
1701000	1704000	they off themselves and they're forced to come back.
1704000	1705000	Oh wait.
1705000	1707000	Did beef oven take his life?
1707000	1708000	Beethoven?
1709000	1710000	I don't know.
1710000	1711000	Monkers.
1711000	1712000	Meatloafs.
1713000	1716000	You go back in time and change one thing in history,
1716000	1718000	but you remain to the timeline.
1718000	1721000	You return to your timeline at any given moment.
1722000	1723000	Wait.
1723000	1724000	So like in theory,
1724000	1726000	I could be 80 years old in the past
1726000	1727000	and then it puts me back here.
1727000	1728000	I kind of be AA.
1728000	1729000	It'd be like,
1729000	1730000	Reflings.
1730000	1731000	Reflings.
1731000	1732000	Do you like gilf?
1732000	1733000	Do you like gilfs?
1733000	1734000	I'd take two-third.
1736000	1737000	I don't think I can hit that.
1737000	1738000	I'm like,
1738000	1739000	sorry,
1739000	1740000	but I need to be with the Reflings.
1740000	1741000	Born too late to,
1741000	1742000	I don't know,
1742000	1743000	C-sutton.
1743000	1745000	Born too early to C-sutton in the future.
1745000	1746000	Born at the right time.
1746000	1747000	I don't know.
1747000	1748000	I don't know.
1748000	1749000	I don't know.
1750000	1752000	Born at the right time to have my Reflings.
1752000	1753000	I'm not pressing.
1753000	1755000	I'm not touching anything with the timeline.
1755000	1756000	I'm keeping it the way it is.
1756000	1757000	I like this timeline.
1757000	1758000	I want to stay on it.
1758000	1760000	I want to be with my Reflings.
1760000	1761000	I got,
1761000	1762000	I got the happy ending.
1762000	1763000	Okay.
1763000	1764000	I got the happy ending.
1764000	1765000	Take care of Granny.
1765000	1768000	Would you love me with Granny Strongzo?
1768000	1769000	Oh,
1769000	1770000	would the sweetie,
1770000	1771000	would,
1771000	1772000	oh wait,
1772000	1773000	I don't know why I'm fucking turning English.
1773000	1774000	Oh,
1774000	1776000	would the sweetie like Sa Sweetie?
1776000	1777000	Yeah.
1777000	1780000	You want to suck on my hard boiled sweet day?
1783000	1786000	After you and three friends get kidnapped,
1786000	1787000	Wilson,
1787000	1789000	you're in trouble and held hostage.
1789000	1792000	One of the nappers decides to let you go,
1792000	1795000	but you have to choose which one of your friends get,
1796000	1797000	um,
1799000	1800000	by what,
1800000	1801000	if you don't choose,
1801000	1802000	both will die.
1802000	1803000	Oh no,
1803000	1804000	I'm not doing none of that.
1805000	1806000	I'm not doing that.
1806000	1808000	You do not put your friends to death.
1808000	1809000	That's crazy.
1810000	1811000	That's crazy.
1811000	1812000	I'm not even,
1812000	1814000	I'm not even participating in this.
1815000	1816000	Um,
1817000	1819000	if it results in death,
1820000	1821000	I'm,
1821000	1822000	I'm not touching it.
1822000	1823000	That's,
1823000	1824000	will they both die?
1824000	1825000	Wait,
1825000	1826000	if I click the button,
1826000	1827000	they both die?
1827000	1828000	No.
1828000	1829000	Yeah.
1829000	1830000	So I did that right.
1830000	1832000	Surely I did that right.
1833000	1834000	Uh,
1834000	1835000	hopefully I did that right.
1835000	1836000	I don't know.
1836000	1837000	Right, hold on.
1837000	1838000	How'd you say?
1838000	1839000	Shawnee killed everyone.
1840000	1841000	Honestly.
1841000	1842000	Jokes on you,
1842000	1843000	I only have,
1843000	1844000	I don't have two friends.
1844000	1845000	Wait,
1845000	1846000	if you bring one friend,
1846000	1847000	do you beat the system?
1847000	1848000	You both get away,
1848000	1849000	scot-free.
1850000	1851000	That was worded awfully.
1851000	1852000	Okay.
1852000	1853000	Thank goodness.
1853000	1854000	Cause I was like,
1854000	1855000	damn,
1855000	1856000	I have not woken up yet.
1856000	1857000	Right.
1857000	1859000	You will receive a lifetime supply of meals
1859000	1861000	from your favorite restaurant,
1861000	1863000	but you will lose the sense
1863000	1864000	of taste and smell.
1864000	1867000	That defeats the entire
1867000	1869000	purpose of enjoying meals
1869000	1871000	from your favorite restaurant.
1871000	1872000	Hi,
1872000	1873000	from the dead,
1873000	1874000	can you use that
1874000	1875000	bring back a dead person button
1875000	1877000	for the next one?
1877000	1878000	Thank you.
1878000	1879000	Sorry,
1879000	1880000	son.
1880000	1881000	But you would lose
1881000	1883000	your sense of taste and smell.
1883000	1885000	This is redundant.
1887000	1888000	That's not an option.
1888000	1889000	That's redundant.
1889000	1890000	You have negated the effects
1890000	1892000	of even pressing the damn thing.
1892000	1894000	No point in pressing it.
1894000	1896000	I'll just pay for the meals myself.
1897000	1898000	Okay,
1898000	1899000	I'll just work extra hard
1899000	1900000	so I can feed myself.
1900000	1901000	God damn.
1901000	1902000	That,
1902000	1904000	what if they're very nutritious meals?
1904000	1905000	I mean,
1905000	1906000	no longer having to pay for food
1906000	1907000	sounds like a dub.
1907000	1908000	Honestly,
1908000	1909000	true.
1909000	1910000	Texture and,
1910000	1911000	I mean,
1911000	1912000	I didn't even put my tongue
1912000	1913000	on a lasagna
1913000	1914000	in between the milty cheese
1914000	1915000	and be like,
1915000	1916000	yeah,
1916000	1917000	that satisfies me.
1917000	1918000	No,
1918000	1919000	that satisfies me is the taste
1919000	1920000	and combination
1920000	1921000	of swallowing.
1921000	1922000	Okay.
1922000	1923000	My,
1923000	1924000	my tongue might be
1924000	1925000	an exploratory sense,
1925000	1926000	but like,
1926000	1927000	I need something
1927000	1928000	to work off of
1928000	1929000	when it comes to food.
1931000	1932000	Right.
1932000	1933000	All new born children
1933000	1934000	from here on
1934000	1935000	will be born
1935000	1936000	perfect
1936000	1937000	with immunity
1937000	1938000	to all diseases
1938000	1940000	incredibly intellect,
1940000	1941000	incredible intellect
1941000	1943000	and good locks.
1943000	1944000	But
1944000	1945000	all single people
1945000	1946000	over the age of 30
1946000	1947000	will die
1947000	1948000	instantaneously.
1948000	1949000	No.
1949000	1950000	Relax.
1950000	1951000	It's,
1951000	1952000	it's okay to have
1952000	1953000	natural selection.
1953000	1954000	Look,
1954000	1955000	I'm sorry.
1955000	1956000	I said it.
1956000	1957000	It's okay to have
1957000	1958000	natural selection
1958000	1959000	within the populace.
1959000	1961000	It's perfectly normal.
1961000	1963000	It comes with nature.
1963000	1964000	Like,
1964000	1965000	I mean,
1965000	1966000	relax.
1966000	1967000	Why is it 30?
1967000	1968000	They decided the wall.
1968000	1969000	They literally said,
1969000	1970000	hags out.
1970000	1971000	They said,
1971000	1973000	lollipops in hags out.
1973000	1974000	No,
1974000	1975000	I'm not pressing the button.
1975000	1976000	Relax.
1977000	1978000	The eugenics button.
1978000	1979000	Stop.
1980000	1981000	That's crazy.
1981000	1982000	I'm 29.
1982000	1983000	So press it.
1983000	1984000	Hag.
1984000	1985000	Literally,
1985000	1986000	they said hags out.
1986000	1987000	Relax.
1987000	1988000	Lollipops in.
1988000	1989000	Okay.
1989000	1990000	Everyone's in.
1990000	1991000	Fine.
1991000	1992000	That was a bizarre button.
1992000	1993000	Some of these are getting
1993000	1994000	rather,
1994000	1995000	rather crazy.
1995000	1996000	No hags.
1996000	1997000	Hag discrimination.
1998000	1999000	Me dead.
1999000	2000000	Hollow life would not
2000000	2001000	survive such a loss
2001000	2002000	to their audience.
2002000	2003000	Wait,
2003000	2004000	is hollow life full
2004000	2005000	of hags?
2006000	2007000	No way.
2008000	2009000	I don't even think
2009000	2010000	we have one hag.
2012000	2013000	I don't think
2013000	2014000	we have one hag.
2016000	2017000	Are we the youngest
2017000	2018000	agency?
2018000	2019000	Wait,
2019000	2020000	is hollow life full of hags?
2021000	2022000	No.
2022000	2023000	A lot of VTuber fans
2023000	2024000	are third plus two.
2024000	2025000	The audience.
2025000	2026000	Oh,
2026000	2027000	the audience.
2027000	2028000	Sorry.
2028000	2029000	I thought they sent the VTuber.
2029000	2030000	I was like,
2030000	2031000	oh my God,
2031000	2032000	are we like a really young agency
2032000	2033000	compared to the
2034000	2035000	thingy?
2037000	2038000	They're all hags
2038000	2039000	with high voices.
2040000	2041000	Hag love.
2041000	2042000	Hag love.
2042000	2043000	Karuna's 40.
2044000	2045000	No, she's not.
2045000	2046000	You're,
2046000	2047000	you're pulling my leg.
2047000	2048000	No one's 40
2048000	2049000	in hollow life.
2050000	2051000	30 ain't,
2051000	2052000	no,
2052000	2053000	that's hag life.
2053000	2054000	What are people smoking?
2054000	2055000	You and she be on high?
2055000	2056000	No,
2056000	2057000	well,
2057000	2058000	you think I'm 30?
2058000	2059000	I'm not over 30.
2059000	2061000	I'm not being funny.
2061000	2063000	I act like I'm over 30.
2064000	2066000	You think I'm a hag?
2067000	2069000	Me more she be?
2069000	2071000	I don't think any of us are hags.
2071000	2072000	Kenda.
2072000	2073000	Oh my God.
2073000	2074000	Danny,
2074000	2076000	I'm over there.
2076000	2078000	You think I'm over there?
2078000	2080000	Can't wait until you're a gilf.
2080000	2081000	I literally,
2081000	2083000	a gilf gliss go granny.
2083000	2084000	That alliteration though.
2084000	2085000	You're done.
2085000	2086000	A bit.
2086000	2087000	Oh my God.
2088000	2089000	A 20-something year old
2089000	2092000	with five kid does sound a bit crazy though.
2092000	2093000	Okay.
2093000	2094000	Thank you.
2094000	2095000	It's over for that refling.
2095000	2096000	Mauds,
2096000	2097000	give that refling a backshot.
2097000	2098000	Old lady's 20.
2098000	2099000	At minimum,
2099000	2100000	you're older than me.
2100000	2101000	Hmm.
2103000	2106000	A bet face connect is the youngest average talent,
2106000	2107000	to be honest.
2107000	2108000	Hmm.
2108000	2109000	What's wrong with being over 30?
2109000	2110000	Absolutely nothing,
2110000	2113000	but I don't think I act like I'm,
2113000	2115000	I feel like 30 is when you mature.
2115000	2117000	I'm not over 30.
2118000	2120000	Wasn't 25 hack?
2120000	2123000	Or expired Xmas cake?
2123000	2124000	What?
2124000	2126000	It's just new terminal,
2126000	2128000	expired Christmas cake.
2128000	2130000	Who is walking around
2130000	2133000	calling VTubers expired Christmas cakes?
2133000	2134000	You need to come back
2134000	2136000	and explain yourself for that comment right now.
2136000	2139000	What does that even mean?
2140000	2142000	A Christmas cake?
2142000	2143000	Oh,
2143000	2144000	that,
2144000	2146000	it's a common term.
2147000	2150000	Matureing is for vegetables.
2150000	2152000	You have to,
2152000	2154000	oh my God.
2154000	2155000	Hag older than me,
2155000	2157000	therefore the age goes up every year.
2157000	2158000	Okay, that's funny.
2158000	2161000	Wait, Christmas cake is a term?
2161000	2162000	No,
2162000	2164000	that's hilarious.
2164000	2165000	I've not heard of that.
2165000	2167000	You might as well just start calling people prunes
2167000	2168000	while you're at it.
2168000	2170000	Oh, you're a wrinkly old prune.
2170000	2171000	What age is that?
2171000	2172000	Oh, oh, it's 20.
2172000	2173000	What?
2173000	2174000	Like,
2175000	2178000	that is hilarious.
2178000	2180000	A Christmas cake is a Japanese term
2180000	2182000	for a woman past her prime.
2182000	2183000	That's shocking.
2183000	2184000	That's,
2184000	2185000	that's,
2185000	2187000	fermented VTuber agency.
2187000	2189000	That is hilarious.
2189000	2190000	I am closing down VLR
2190000	2192000	to open that up right now.
2192000	2194000	It's just dedicated to hags only.
2194000	2196000	Imagine getting called a reason.
2196000	2197000	Honestly,
2197000	2199000	Shawnee is the least wee VTuber
2199000	2200000	I've ever seen.
2200000	2201000	True.
2201000	2203000	I'm a gamer over a weeb.
2204000	2206000	Does that mean I'm shunned?
2206000	2207000	Am I shunned?
2209000	2211000	But I do want to watch enemies with you.
2211000	2212000	Actually, that's a side note.
2212000	2214000	I do want to watch enemies with you guys.
2214000	2215000	So,
2215000	2217000	there'll be a wave three confirmed.
2217000	2219000	Gen three full of hags.
2219000	2221000	I mean,
2221000	2223000	well, it can't be gen two
2223000	2225000	unless you want a hag and a lollipop
2225000	2228000	because there's two lollipops.
2230000	2231000	VLR lasts long enough
2231000	2233000	it'll become a hardcore.
2233000	2234000	Honestly,
2234000	2235000	I mean,
2235000	2237000	if you guys didn't know,
2237000	2239000	the girls will renew their contract
2239000	2241000	in May 2025
2241000	2243000	and as an incentive
2243000	2244000	to stay on,
2244000	2247000	the split goes to 85.15
2247000	2250000	and we also purchase them
2250000	2252000	an alternative outfit
2252000	2254000	they can ask for what they want
2254000	2257000	and we'll pay the costs for it.
2257000	2258000	So yeah,
2258000	2259000	if you watch JoJo's,
2259000	2261000	I'll stop by watching right now.
2261000	2262000	Oh, isn't JoJo's long?
2262000	2263000	I mean,
2263000	2265000	I'm talking like 12-episode stuff.
2265000	2266000	I mean,
2266000	2267000	we can even watch a bit of Bentay
2267000	2268000	if you want.
2268000	2269000	Like, calm down.
2272000	2273000	Yes.
2273000	2274000	Lollibaba gen,
2274000	2275000	just all of them.
2275000	2276000	It depends.
2276000	2277000	It has various seasons.
2277000	2278000	If you think about it,
2278000	2281000	Hale is around for like seven years.
2281000	2288000	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
2288000	2290000	Is it that halo you were talking about?
2292000	2294000	Is my dress up darling possible?
2295000	2296000	Is it long?
2297000	2298000	12?
2298000	2299000	Yeah, like I'm talking like
2299000	2300000	we sit down for the day
2300000	2302000	and watch a 12-episode anime together.
2302000	2304000	That's what I want to do.
2304000	2306000	They said holo, not halo.
2306000	2307000	Oh, sorry!
2307000	2308000	Sorry.
2308000	2309000	I wasn't kidding when I said
2309000	2310000	I was a gamer.
2310000	2317960	I said it was a gamer, okay? I read Halo. I thought you were talking about Halo, the
2317960	2327480	hit video game, okay? Master Chief from Fortnite. Sorry. Sorry. Based in gamer build, honestly.
2327480	2334720	Right. You can get a ton of candy that you love. You'll never be able to read a book.
2334720	2339080	Oh no, I'm in a reading book. Sorry. I'm in a reading book. I've been enjoying reading
2339080	2344840	a few books. I will abstain from this button. I've been enjoying a good book. And I've
2344840	2348880	still not even read Lord of the Rings with you yet. Reading isn't for Mummy today and
2348880	2352680	this entire stream is about reading so it's not going well. I don't know what to replace
2352680	2360200	tomorrow's stream with yet. I don't know if I'll bring up the honey. I don't know if
2360200	2364640	you guys saw the schedule. I'm playing Honeycam Studios. That game used to have everyone in
2364640	2369320	a freaking grip. Ooh, we're going to do reading stream. Well, this is technically reading,
2369320	2376520	is it not? I'm reading chat and I'm reading, will you press the button? You want the bent
2376520	2380880	high stream tomorrow? Hmm. Wait, you said Lord of the Rings would be when you graduate.
2380880	2386680	Oh, did I? For the book? Okay, we're not reading Lord of the Rings anytime soon then. I still,
2386680	2391240	put me back in the ring, Chief. I still got it. I still got it, okay? I got that doll.
2392120	2398840	Let me back in the ring. Bunny Garden. It's no for me. It's no for me. I'll have a hunt
2398840	2404720	around and see if I can find a few shorter games. I just stopped being sad when I watched
2404720	2412600	Johnny. No pass on this. Okay, you can make all the world feel happy, but you become sad.
2412600	2421880	I become sad. Um, I don't think I can stream very well if I'm in a bad mood. A cheese, oh,
2421880	2430320	a chess blitz stream when? Um, there's a solid one here, you like that? What remains of Edith
2430320	2435600	Flint? I'm playing that in three weeks. I wrote that down because someone recommended it and
2435600	2441440	it was short. Already depressed, I'll push the button. Oh, I'll be fine. Nothing changes for
2441440	2446120	me, but the world gets better. Why not? Oh, no, I'm not that sad. I'm quite, I'm always quite
2446120	2451720	neutral or happy. I don't think it, wait, I don't, can I make you as happy if I'm depressed?
2451720	2460360	I don't know. I feel like I can't do it because if I'm depressed, I can't even stream. An actual
2460360	2464160	dilemma for once. This is probably the first one that I've actually had a dilemma with.
2464160	2470320	Have you played Sucker for Love? I have not. I can't be sad when watching you pass. Press the
2470320	2474520	button. I'm already at that stage. If Stroni was sad, I would be sad. Yeah, literally, I'd be
2474520	2480240	greeting over anything and making you guys upset. So no. Oh, wow, I'm in the minority. This is the
2480240	2488800	first question I've been in the minority. Wow. Oh, no, I couldn't be sad. I feel like I'd wrought
2488800	2496320	away, I'd waste away. Oh, no, that's the first one I failed where I don't, I'm not with the
2496320	2503600	majority. Oh, wait, what did I just do? Oops. Oh, sorry. I thought I was on the same one. I'm so
2503600	2507800	sorry. I thought I was on the same one. What did I say no to? Half Life 3 comes out, but you never
2507800	2514320	get to play it. And I said, no. Oops. Okay, let's actually do it. Sorry. The Byzantine
2514320	2530360	Empire is revived. What? What kind of question is that? What kind of question is this? Oh, my
2530360	2538080	god. I thought this is like a funny thing. Yeah. Oh, this is bizarre. How did that even get in?
2539040	2551600	Did they not review the submitted questions? What the fuck? That's bizarre. That's bizarre. We're
2551600	2558800	skipping, we're skipping this. We're not, this isn't a submission or anything of anything. What the
2558800	2565040	fuck? What the fuck? We're skipping. We're not even looking at the results. Okay. That was bizarre.
2565040	2570800	Anyway, unlimited supply of your favorite cereal for the rest of your life, but you can't have any
2570800	2580160	milk with it. This, people love submitting things that negate the benefit of the first one. Like,
2580160	2584720	here's the benefit. Oh, by the way, we're gonna negate it. Okay, so there's pointless then. There's
2584720	2593200	no point to it. Like, I'm lactose intolerant. Anyway, let's go. Press. I don't even use milk.
2593280	2600240	Water and cereal, it is. Don't ever speak for the rest of the stream. Don't make me ever think
2600240	2608720	about watery Cheerios. I don't want to think about watery Cheerios, okay? Okay, you're allowed to
2608720	2616000	speak, but don't do that again. Okay. Juice and cereal. What kind of juice? How do you put juice
2616000	2622080	in Cheerios? Substitute with yogurt. Time out that reflint. Never cook again.
2623360	2628560	Wait, we can give it to the people who need it. Oh, if it's boxed up, then sure, I'd donate that
2628560	2635440	stuff. I don't eat cereal anyway. Yeah, that's fine. We'll box it up and we'll give it to food
2635440	2641440	banks. I have no problem with that. I'm not fussed for cereal. It's just like sugary thingy anyway.
2641440	2649600	Wait, hold up. Is Cheerios your favorite? I like Honey Cheerios. I like Frosted Shreddies,
2649600	2656640	and I like Crunchy Knot. It's called Crunchy Knot in the UK. Stop laughing. Stop it Americans.
2656640	2660960	I know you're laughing right now. It's called Crunchy Knot. It's the name of the cereal.
2661760	2668320	It's not your sock, okay? It's not your crusty sock. It's called Crunchy Knot. It is. It's what
2668320	2679440	the cereal's called. Stop. That nut, oh man. Base, I love those Crunchy Knot. Laugh at her. No,
2679440	2686480	it's what it's called. My nuts a bit more chewy, sadly. You're right. It's our Crunchy Socks. I
2686480	2694000	was going to make the most disgusting ASMR. Someone tweeted something hilarious, and it was like a
2694880	2702240	crunchy sock, and I was like, I really want to make an ASMR of me munching, and it's like girlfriend
2702240	2708160	munches on your crusty sock ASMR at the bottom of your bed while you sleep or something like that,
2708160	2712000	and it's absolutely disgusting. Actually, I'm going to write that down before I forget. Write that down.
2712000	2725680	Write that down. Girlfriend munches on your crusty sock ASMR, and it's just me like, that's delicious,
2725680	2730880	and all of that, and I'm munching away. That's disgusting. No way, that's foul, but it's so funny.
2730880	2737120	It is foul. That's why I want to make it. Okay, you've become the funniest person on the planet.
2738080	2743360	You can only talk in jokes, and they're always Chuck Norris jokes. Again with the negation.
2745280	2751680	I'm going to need you to come up with abstract concepts that these two don't relate, but they're
2751680	2762560	on a level, whether that be philosophical, physical, some sort of same level. But Chuck Norris jokes
2762560	2767200	are funny. I can't even remember. Can we just go back to unbirth? You know what, you're done.
2768480	2772560	Are you saying Chuck Norris isn't funny? What's the Chuck Norris thing? I can't remember.
2775840	2780480	I've literally forgotten the Chuck Norris memes. Stroni's already the funniest person on the planet.
2780480	2783360	You stop that, you give me an ego. We all know women can't be funny.
2785760	2791120	I'm accidentally humorous. That's why I am. That's by accident. Does that make you the only person
2791120	2794400	on the planet? Chuck Norris jokes are really not. Chuck Norris doesn't eat honey. He chews bees.
2794400	2802080	Ah, right. Okay, I remember. I remember. I remember. I remember. Get on with the funniest.
2802080	2810160	The sin of greed is not here. Again, I'm going to say no. I don't know. I will not press. You
2810160	2816240	cannot tempt me, devil. But yeah. Oh, wow. Okay, majority vote there. Only 19%. We're like, yeah,
2816320	2825760	that's good. Okay, you become completely immortal. I don't like that. If humanity hasn't made it to
2825760	2830640	interstellar travel and sun has gone supernova, you will drift in space alone still. No,
2831360	2836480	absolutely not. See, the reason why I like vampires is because you know, if you've ever had enough,
2836480	2840880	you can just go to someone, go and do as a favor pal. See this bit of wood, go and just hammer it
2840880	2847440	through my chest. That'd be great pal. Just stay up, right? But this version, absolutely not. It's
2847440	2856080	the most horrific thing I have ever seen. Like vampire, you take it, you're crazy. Just jumping
2856080	2862800	to a black hole. A bit of cheeky spaghettification to solve the problem. Why not? Being stuck in
2862800	2870240	space doesn't sound so bad. There's no internet in space. Who wants to become immortal? Are you crazy?
2871600	2877920	Understand all truth of the universe but can never talk to others again. Well, good thing,
2877920	2884080	I know sign language. Boom. And I can write stuff down on paper. Boom. Press that,
2884080	2890960	motherfucker. Oh wait, how am I supposed to livestream? Would you guys still watch me if
2890960	2896320	the way I communicated was by doing, like, I like to do sign language and write stuff down?
2897040	2903440	Can I still make noises? It says talk. If I can still make noises, all you're gonna hear is like
2904880	2913680	just use a talk text to speech stream, morse code stream. I have no idea what I've just said
2913680	2921360	if I actually said anything. If TTS has a Scottish accent, I mean, I wouldn't understand you one bit
2921360	2927520	but sure. But imagine all of the conspiracy theories I can tell you about. Come on, that's like
2927520	2937200	unlimited content. Wait, how would we get ASMR? It would just be non-talking ASMR. So congrats to
2937200	2942560	the people that don't like talking ASMR. I got you covered. You press the button but the button
2942560	2949040	doesn't work. Go for it then. Wait, why did no one press that? She chose knowledge over us. No,
2949040	2958880	I'll give you the details, okay? Eh, no talking ASMR. I don't like it. You gain the power to stop
2958880	2967840	time as long as you want and as often as you want but while time has stopped, you age normally
2967840	2973360	and each time you restart, you age, bruv, again with the negation.
2977760	2985920	I mean, I guess it's optional. I can't imagine I'm up to anything but to skip six months of health
2985920	2994640	is insane though. You guys are saying easy press? You gain the power to stop time as long as you want.
2995440	2999840	What would I need to do with that? I mean, I guess if I had just all lined up at convention,
3001760	3008880	it'd be worth it. Nah, I don't think I like that. I guess if it's optional to have it as a back
3008880	3014000	pocket ability, like say you wear, I think someone said car crash there. Yeah, say if you knew you
3014000	3020960	were about to be in a car crash. Mugging the car crash? Okay. I'm pressing it because it's an optional
3020960	3028560	ability. You don't have to activate it but it could be life or death. So I'm actually not too
3028560	3038560	raging at it. You can ink with any women you want just by pointing at them and asking but you must
3038560	3044960	watch the notebook each time. This is just an OG, son. What's going on here? You guys, I'm pretty
3044960	3056080	sure that Snowberries just watched the notebook with icicle. Can we change this to a reflin instead?
3056800	3061120	You can have... Oh, I said the word sorry, I did. I just slapped my mouth there. If you heard that,
3061120	3066480	you can have... You can ink. Hey, Strani, never made me pointing at you but I need to ask you
3066480	3073120	something. We can already do this. Don't need to do that one more minute. That's all good. I
3073120	3080320	literally just smacked my mouth there. Right, let's just pretend this says refling. Thank you. I'll
3080320	3089760	take it. Thank you very much. Yeah, 60% said I. Well, Strani doesn't want to ink with me. No, because
3089760	3100480	it specifies every time you ink. Yeah, but with a partner. I mean, that could be the aftercare.
3100480	3105040	Oh, let's slap on the notebook. How long's the notebook? I've never seen it. I don't know what
3105040	3109680	it's about, to be honest. Apparently, refling's your in it. You're featured in it.
3112800	3116640	Strani, you just need to ask. I'd cry every time. It's too long. It's two hours.
3118720	3123840	It would be wild if the movie just flashed in your head during... Google says it's two hours and 10
3123840	3130240	minutes. Oh, that's quite a lot. Can't be aftercare. You need to watch before. But someone said it
3130240	3138080	makes you cry. You have an unlimited amount of cash, power, and good looks. But Justin Bieber is
3138080	3144240	your roommate for the rest of your life. He acts like a massive douchebag. Is this... How old is
3144240	3151920	this website? Is this like an old-ass question? Do you remember the hate that Justin Bieber used to
3151920	3161760	get? Oh my god. Mail on stream. Literally not having that. Like, I feel like... Right, this is just
3161760	3169520	me. I feel like if you never work towards something, like, you never get that satisfaction of trying
3169520	3175760	hard and getting it to pay off. Like, if it's just handed to you, so is but. This is just me. If it's
3175760	3180720	just handed to you, you've got nothing to work towards. Like, now don't get me wrong. Capitalism,
3180720	3187040	bad and all that. But if you had unlimited money, what experiences do you get other than making
3187040	3194400	poor people miserable and, like, squandering over, like, falling out your feet to try and get a tip
3194400	3202960	from you type thing? Like, is that what gives, you know, billionaire? I would literally... You know,
3202960	3209200	actually, if I had unlimited money, I think I'd bring back the arts. I want architecture. I want
3209200	3215760	sandstone architecture back in. I want rid of this new age buildings. I want historical, beautiful
3215760	3222160	features. I want the arts back. Have you seen the churches made in the 15th century? Stunning,
3222160	3230880	beautiful, still standing. And then churches today are, like, ugly. I'm here for the culture. When we
3230880	3238480	play Civilian Civilization 5, I'm here for the culture, okay? I want culture. I like culture,
3238480	3244320	okay? Done with modern architecture, exactly. Using limited money to lobby every Congress,
3244880	3250080	parliament on earth to do your bidding. Now you're talking, like, a real refling. I like that, I like
3250080	3260400	that. Holy Bacus, bring back past architecture. Cultural victory, reject modern return to Ziggurats.
3260960	3266720	Cultural victory. No way to get rid of him means you can kill him. You can kill him?
3268480	3274960	Actually, yeah, he doesn't have to be alive. And if I have unlimited power, I mean, no one's gonna
3274960	3281520	find out. He acts like a mess and... Oh, there's no way to get rid of him. Oh, no, sorry. It's not worth it.
3282960	3288880	It's not worth it, okay? You can choose to save the life of any loved one or friend at will,
3288880	3299120	but they will no longer remember who you are. I don't... I'm not one for meddling with nature. I
3299120	3308000	find it quite rather... I think when you're, you know, I don't believe in, like, fate or, like,
3308000	3314240	you know, you're destined for this or that. But I'm not a fan of, like, Trump and nature. Like,
3314320	3320800	I'll let nature do its course, you know? I'd press it for you. Oh, Riefling! What the...
3320800	3324480	Don't say that. Are you trying to make us cry? It's like first thing in the morning. Are you
3324480	3329920	trying to make us cry? Oh, my God. I press it to love someone. You sometimes you have to be a stranger.
3329920	3333680	Well, literally, I don't know if you guys remember Harry Potter where Hermione had to
3334400	3339920	get her parents to forget or I'm like, oh, my God. I hope she can reverse that.
3340880	3346400	Um, Spider-Man already did that. I doubt my friends are getting into many life or death,
3346400	3356400	but I could re-meet them and check they existed. I don't know. Imagine saving a parent. Oh,
3358400	3363280	it didn't sound... Oh, I don't know if I can even speak on that because I've not lost a parent.
3364240	3367680	I'd probably feel way different at a later date, but
3370320	3378560	that route forgetting you as well is like really... It's not... Yeah, I'm not sure. I'm not touching
3378560	3384400	that. I'm not touching it. Well, yeah, I'm in the minority with that one. That scares me. That
3384400	3395680	kind of stuff scares me. That one was a hard one. That was not an easy one.
3396720	3400480	Johnny, I would also press it for you. I would make you happy even if I meant I could never...
3400480	3405120	You never knew who I was. That's so sad though. Are you trying to make me great? I'll greet
3405120	3408720	first thing in the morning. Don't think I want. Learn to love yourself and then save yourself,
3408720	3413600	but they will remember everyone else close to them. That was not easy. I didn't like that. Better
3413600	3418560	have it than not to have it. No one can say you got to use it. Oh, that's true. Well, I've just
3418560	3430160	passed on it. Learn to love... Yes. You get to make friends all over again if you press it. That's
3430160	3441360	true. You get to download as many songs as you want. How old is this question? iPod? You get to...
3442240	3447840	I have never... That's an ancient relic by today's standards. It's not even a thing anymore.
3449840	3457520	You get to download as many songs as you want on your iPod. The songs have... Again with Justin...
3458560	3464160	This is old. We're skipping. This is so old. The age is showing of this question. That's crazy.
3465120	3474560	I'm literally lying while I go brrrrr. I'd press this. It doesn't say you have to listen to any of it.
3475520	3480880	You young ones don't even know what an iPod is. Easiest press to get an iPod. It's an iPod
3480880	3488800	with a headphone jack. I still use an iPod for work. Oh, replaying. Are you an OG son?
3488800	3497520	All right. We've found the ancient tip. You can see through all holding, but you cannot turn the
3497520	3507360	power off. Oh, no. That's not for me. I feel like you'd get desensitized very quickly, but that's
3507360	3519520	not for me. No. Yeah, I'm skipping. Well, 41% said I. No, that's no right. That's no right. You're
3519520	3527040	getting done for that. That's indecent. I'd press it only if I'm filthy rich. Oh, so you could pick
3527040	3534240	and choose who's around you. We've got an Asian population, so nah, I'll pass. You have incredible
3534240	3539200	art skills, but you're unable to share it on the internet for your entire life. That's funny,
3539200	3547760	because I actually wanted to pick up art when I retire and become a wee artist. I'm going to skip
3547760	3555440	because you can develop art skills over years. Yes, it takes years, but that's the progress. That's
3555440	3560720	the journey. It's a part of the journey. It's not about when it comes to Lord of the Rings,
3560800	3566240	you didn't skip to Mount Doom, did you? And pop the ring in. No. You take the journey. You
3566240	3574560	watch your progress. You watch your craft evolve. Just have someone else share it. You know what?
3574560	3579360	See your reef lens and your smart ways of just getting around the rules. That's actually really
3579360	3584800	smart. Please don't type that again. You're going to start ruining these if you get the lip around.
3585200	3594320	And that is hilarious. NDA forbids me from sharing art online. You can share art in any other way.
3594320	3599840	Loop polling it. Honestly, I'll get you guys to loop poll it for me, because I'll take that. I love
3599840	3605760	art. I think it's amazing. Emi drew that one piece of artwork for herself. Well, she's actually
3605840	3612080	drawn multiple with it. That one banner-esque one, it was absolutely insane quality. Like insane.
3614560	3622400	72% of the people have pressed this button whilst 27% did not. Yeah, literally skirt the rules.
3624320	3630480	We create a new internet. We're toppling the system, strongy. Just for me. Stop it. You're making me
3630480	3636480	blue. It feels good to see people improve their skills over time. Press equals sell to some random
3636480	3641200	private collection. It's easy and rich. Speed runs. Reeflings pull together to make a strongy
3641200	3650480	art. Oh, you can be anywhere you want in your room right now. Reefling under your desk. But you have to
3650480	3663040	be a pawn. What is- I don't understand how that's even- Oh, do you want to become a horse? It's
3663040	3667760	basically asking do you want to become a horse? No, there's not going to be a horse girl for Jen
3667760	3674480	too. Stop asking. It doesn't- Like, aw, you just randomly turn into a horse for the rest of your
3674480	3680960	life. Bruv. That's not how none of this works. Again, the freaking horses. I can't escape.
3681680	3687600	Even pony calls. You're done. Strongy pony. Strongy show horse.
3688960	3696560	MLP brunies winning. Any cloffers, honestly. A pony cannot watch streams. This sucks.
3697360	3703200	The writer barely disguised- The writer's barely disguised fish. That is hilarious. No, we're not
3703280	3705600	becoming a freaking pony. Are you joking? Yeah, let-
3708400	3712160	Oh, some people have had enough of the system if they'll happily become a pony.
3714160	3720960	What's the downside? Oh, honestly. Instead of a cuttlefish I'm a seahorse. Oh, that's kind of cute.
3722160	3730400	Friendship is magic and magic is heresy. There's 32,000 brunies. We're on to them. We've caught them
3730480	3736000	in 4K. You understand every human language in existence? That's a good one, but you are a mutant
3736000	3745280	can never- Again with the negation! Here is cool thing. Here's negation. Am I like ruining this
3745280	3752640	little fun website by pointing out the major flaws of the questions? I'm passing on that. Sorry,
3752640	3758880	I need my communication skills. Unless, you know, the only other exception is I get to learn everything
3758880	3762720	and then I get to do my tinfoil hat stream with full confidence.
3765040	3772640	Yeah, 65% said no, which is right. You make one horrible event in the past cease to exist,
3772640	3775440	but you will be responsible for a hor- No, that-
3777280	3783840	This is just a circle! Remove one to gain one. You have given us a circle. Give us a better one.
3784800	3790320	You have given us a dang circle. Just write or use a TTS absolute dub, honestly.
3791840	3800560	Can you choose the event? I don't know. I mean, this makes you an A tier translator,
3800560	3804960	but yeah, 90% of superpower with downsides is literally just coolest thing ever, followed by
3804960	3810880	wow, this sucks, yeah. If I get to pick the horrible event I'm responsible for,
3811680	3817840	I don't know what kind of human event I would be comfortable causing. Can we call it, like,
3817840	3824000	the mass inking maybe? And be like, all guys around the world couldn't go to work that day
3824000	3829360	because they can't feel their thighs after how hard they just inked, you know? Like,
3829360	3835760	something like that? Would that work? Is that fine? I'd be fine causing that, like, catastrophe.
3835760	3839360	I'm fine with that. That's fine. I'll take one for the team. I'll make some of the most
3839360	3846640	great collapse of capitalism. Steady. We don't have a system yet to swoop in with. You get to
3846640	3853040	be a world-famous vtuber, but you're a Scottish cuttlefish. Stop! That's so funny. Not exactly
3853040	3859280	world-famous, steady on. Strani, aren't you planning on killing humanity via siren feeding?
3859280	3866880	Look, you've caught me in a bit of a pickle, but maybe there was some talk of that. Not at the
3866880	3872800	moment, though. Not at the moment. I'm just bing-chinging. Dang it. Bing-chinging. She's gonna
3872800	3880960	make us ink. Domain expansion, infinite inkworks, honestly. Strani, I wish to be responsible for
3880960	3890080	coming again. Ink again. The Great Brown Noise incident of 54. The day Strani made the entire
3890080	3899280	population ink. Eh, right. Yeah, but she's kind of bad at it. Okay, okay. Your ability to listen,
3899280	3908560	touch, taste, smell, and conversation are improved. You lose the ability to say,
3908560	3914640	nah, I can't be blind, so I need my bowls. I think if I had to pick between losing a sense,
3914720	3923760	first is smell. Couldn't... first is smell. Then... so touch is actually a really dangerous one to
3923760	3928640	lose because that's how you tell you're injured or whatever, but thankfully I don't do anything that's
3928640	3936720	injury-based. You just become the daredevil. I'd lose my sense of pain. Five head, lose your sense
3936720	3944560	of temperature because you're... was it... didn't Vsauce? Vsauce was like, oh, I swear God, if my
3944560	3949600	dad's about to burst in this room, I can hear him listen. Right, no, we're skipping that one. I'd like
3949600	3956560	to keep my eyeballs, please. Right, you can turn into any animal that you've seen with your own eyes,
3956560	3962480	not in a photo. Right, so we've become the green guy from Team Titans, I've forgotten his name,
3962480	3967360	but you have to die in the animal form to go back. You have to die in the animal form
3968800	3978240	to go back. That's so bizarre. That doesn't make sense. If you lose your sense of touch,
3978240	3983440	you can't ink. I take it back, I don't want that one. Smell is an easy one to lose, yeah.
3984400	3990800	Would I experience the pain? Yeah, like, a zoo? Beast... oh, Beast Boy's name, okay, that makes sense.
3992160	3998480	Um, bunch of the electric cables, honestly, that's pretty... I wonder how easy it would be
3998480	4003360	to pop your clogs if you're an animal. Being like, hmm, I will walk in front of this car now. No,
4003360	4011600	I'm skipping this. I'm skipping, I don't like it, I'm scared. Oh wow, we're in the minority, oh my.
4013520	4018000	You have the fastest internet for free, you can play any game online for free and never
4018000	4025200	have to pay for membership. So literally VTuber, but ultimate VTuber, but you must watch a minimum of
4028560	4039040	this age terribly. This is such an old, oh no. If I had to waste three hours a day on anything,
4039040	4044240	I don't have enough time to stream. That's not a benefit, okay? It's, I'm already doing it. Someone
4044240	4051840	says, oh okay dude, okay dude, no downside. That is far too much time commitment, literally three
4051840	4060560	hours is insane. I'm stretching, I already do it. Okay, yous are all done. I would watch
4061600	4068480	all the popcorn, Elizabeth's popcorn. I'd press it plus, I can just send it to my friends as a joke.
4068480	4080160	Does ASMR count? Is there, is there Lebanese ASMR of like two chicks together? I didn't even know
4080160	4090400	that was a thing. Oh girls, are you ready for off collab? That's awful, we're skipping that one.
4090400	4095600	I do not have three hours a day. I, I need to give everything to the refunds, okay?
4095600	4102080	Lebanese, yes. The clam, slammy, smart. There's definitely female for female ASMR.
4102960	4111040	And then everything exists. I don't think I've ever looked up. Hmm, it's sad people don't have time
4111040	4118160	for popcorn anymore. That's terrible. You can temporarily take over the body of any person
4118880	4122720	on earth, and you can turn back into yourself whenever, but they die, oh,
4124240	4132000	Merve, Merve. Okay, hold on. If I want to become an assassin to take down,
4135600	4139280	you can temporarily take over the body and turn back, but they die.
4141440	4147600	They die after you leave their body. So I'm a walking death note. Yeah, I'll do it. I'm down with
4148320	4154080	stop and refling the high table down with the high table reeflings. Yes. Yes.
4155120	4162880	End me pl- No! End me PLS. Reefling, Brian. KFP Spidey. Thank you for the five. No.
4166640	4171360	We're not doing that. Ain't that basically what siren does anyway? True. So it's not really
4171360	4177520	anything too particularly new concept wise. Strone's body hopping across the world
4177520	4183440	and fast tracking her goal of ending the world, honestly. You can foresee the future
4183440	4188720	reeflings. I predict an inking for you. Yes, yes. Did I guess right? Are you inking?
4190080	4198160	Okay, soon you will ink within the next week. You cannot prevent anything that will occur.
4198160	4204480	I think having foresight would be good. I get the- Wait, no, you can't prevent it.
4204880	4210080	Are you serious? Are you serious? So you can only what? Mentally prepare? Get inside me?
4210080	4214880	Get inside me, mama. Brian, you're not supposed to say that out loud. Thank you, boy.
4217040	4224000	I mean, I can. I'll do it right now. Okay, there we go. I'm inside. Do you feel me?
4225440	4231120	Just means you can prepare for it. So I can't prevent it from occurring, but I can prepare
4231120	4235440	around it. I'd say that's a benefit. If I can prepare around it, I'll take it.
4236480	4244160	Yeah, I inked. Or someone else could defy fate for you. Yeah, yeah, again, definitely. Get ready
4244160	4248720	to see a lot of death. This would put me in such a defeats mentality. I cannot change the future,
4248720	4256640	so what does it matter? I don't know. I guess like, it says you can't prevent it. So say you
4256640	4261600	put a hundred bucks in the stock market and saw ahead like where it would go. You can't change
4261600	4265280	what the stock market is going to change to. Anyway, damn it, the stock markets won't want it,
4265280	4271040	but just as an example off the top of my head, stop wiggling your toes while in there. It tickles.
4271040	4276080	I can't help it. The weird thing was, I was actually violently wiggling my toes when you typed
4276080	4282240	that. Are you in my room? Refling? Refling? Are you here? I'm getting nervous. How did you know
4282240	4288400	I was wiggling my toes the moment I said that? Hey, Astroni, you can be in me whenever you want
4288400	4294880	and replay. Right. You have the power to teleport anywhere at any time, past or future. You are
4294880	4300000	doomed to be a homeless person and can't change your fate. So again, we can just get around this.
4300000	4306560	I don't have to have a legal like in the legality of having a freaking thing in my name. Like,
4306560	4313280	it's just a bingty name. Traveling with zero ain't got to be a home. Yeah, literally like
4314240	4320000	sure, it's already after the Baloch, Balochu stream, hotel, yeah, hotel. Again, we can get around this.
4320000	4328080	Like, I think that would be really good to cut about. You become the emperor of earth,
4328080	4335440	ruling over the entire human, wait, people will listen to me and we can set up a system that's
4335440	4342880	sustainable. Hold on a minute. Other spacefaring civilizations, many of them hostile, discover
4342880	4347760	earth and we'll try to conquer the planet. I don't know if I could submit people to defend
4347760	4358400	and get put to death. I don't like that. For the m, is this a warhammer 40k reference?
4358400	4365840	I will kneel to emperor stroney and die in her honor. No, I don't want to send just the war
4365840	4372640	purge the Zenoes. This is just 40k for the empire for mommy. No, I don't want to send
4372640	4382320	just the war and defend me. Surely if I can get the planet to all agree on the mission objective,
4382320	4390160	then we'd maybe get away with it. It says many of them hostile. You know what? In theory,
4390160	4398160	we could make pals with someone who's really nice. We'll try. We are the emperor's hammer. No,
4398160	4403600	you're fine. The planet broke before the garden. Hey, it's self defense coming on. Let us and
4403600	4407360	let's stop. You're not supposed to defend me to the death. You're supposed to live a good and
4407440	4414880	happy life. Okay, right next. You are granted the scientific knowledge needed to produce
4414880	4420000	limitless energy for the rest of the world at an affordable cost. Yes, because public sectors
4420000	4429920	should be owned by the public. Shocking. I know. You must live as a pauper and end your days with
4429920	4438400	the solitary death in a remote shack in the woods. Yeah, you mean the the inking, the inking
4438400	4446880	shack in the middle of nowhere? Yes. You're trolling, right? What's the downside? Oh, you're poor.
4448080	4454400	Aspondent, poor, relax. It's not that big a deal. It's honestly not that big a deal,
4454400	4461680	sauce. It is not that big a deal. Relax. Infinite energy and I get the farm with the reeflings.
4461680	4465680	It doesn't mean you guys can't own a PC in there and we can all meme on the internet
4465680	4469520	and play games like we can finally play couch co-op games together.
4472320	4478000	I'm the old man in the movies that gives advice to the main character. No internet in the shack.
4478000	4481040	Well, you guys can own internet. I've said none, but you're not owning it.
4481680	4485280	Oh, my God. Why are we asking that?
4489760	4491120	Oh, my God.
4494000	4499600	What is with these questions? Oh, by the way, Al Qaeda never did that. Relax. I'm not touching
4499600	4505920	that. I'm not touching that word. Do these not get screened? If you press the red button, you gain
4505920	4513680	a quadrillion dollars offered by the president. But you are told by the president to buy only
4513680	4519920	things that are cheaper than candy. Well, there's like, oh, sorry. There's like, sorry, I dropped my
4519920	4526560	pen on the thing. There's like gold candy. I'm sure there's like some ridiculous, this candy bar
4526560	4532960	costs 12,000 US dollars due to the importation. We covered it in gold, all that pitch. Sorry,
4532960	4538560	it's free money. It's free money and I can do so much with it. There'll be one candy bar out there
4538560	4543840	that's covered in gold. I assure you, look up right now, type in most expensive candy in the
4543840	4549440	world and it'll be some pitch from Dubai and covered in gold. Free money. I can do a lot
4549440	4564000	with that money. Okay. Did you say cheapest candy? Oh no. That doesn't make sense then.
4570080	4578000	That makes, wait, you can only buy things that are cheaper than one cent. So nothing.
4578960	4580560	So you have negated the button.
4583360	4588640	What's the point? The lip hold would require the government to artificially inflate the price
4588640	4596160	of candy. But then again, it really depends on what market. Cheapest can, it'll be a sin. There's
4596160	4602560	no, there'll be mass produce. That was absolutely rubbish. Terrible button. Go back to the drawing
4602720	4610240	room. Be in rule of your own country. Can we get a strongy island? But you will become the most
4610240	4615760	hated rule in the history of the world. I don't want you guys to hate me though. Is it because I
4615760	4622240	do too much mandatory inking? Be honest, is it the mandatory inking? And I have the right to not
4622240	4628480	be prosecuted for anything I may or may not do to you? Smile. Is that why you hate me? And then
4628560	4635680	the rest of the world hates me because they couldn't get an invite to strongy islands, okay? So that's
4635680	4641520	the reason why people hate me. It's because they're like, I'm not, I'm not a reflander. Don't get an
4641520	4651280	invite to the islands. Yeah? Yeah? Come on, shouldn't bless. Yeah, I'm pressing it. The reason the world
4651280	4660800	they hated her because she did what she wanted. Yeah, I'm pressing that. Every girl you meet
4660800	4665360	will fall in love with you. I'll swap the genders. So every refling you meet will fall in love with
4665360	4671280	you, but you will never fall in love with them. Oh, that's sad. No, I don't like that one. No,
4671280	4676080	I don't like that one. I wouldn't try as hard as much if like I wasn't in love with my reflins.
4676480	4682960	Hmm. I don't like that one. You have the ability to build anything, any time, anywhere. Oh my god,
4682960	4692800	the button predicted Fortnite. Under Fortnite, Battle Pass. I just shit all my ass and I booted up my
4692800	4703440	PC because I need me to get that Fortnite Battle Pass. Tada. I like Fortnite. It's nighttime.
4703440	4711120	You remember that show, Adventure Time. What's the point? Some of these, they do be negating
4711120	4718560	pretty hard after a while. Get out of my head. Continually blue folds. By stormy going, no,
4722480	4727200	you have the ability to build anything, any time, anywhere at Fortnite. You lack the materials
4727200	4730160	needed and always have to find or buy them in order to build what you want.
4732400	4740160	I'm, I'm going to say something controversial, but isn't that what joiners do? This button says,
4740160	4746640	do you want to become a joiner? Yes or no? Yes. Okay, go to B&Q and pick up the stuff. That's
4746640	4752640	literally what the, it's just said. And for the Aussies, your version is bunnings. I don't know
4752640	4760400	what B&Q is in America. That literally said, do you want to become a joiner? Yes or no? Okay,
4760400	4765520	go pick up the materials for the job. Okay. You mean like everyone else in the world?
4767360	4774080	So yeah. Okay. I'll take the, I'll take the joiner skill. Sure. Did you just say a real sense?
4774800	4783440	What? B&Q? Is this an ad? No. Be an architect, I guess. Wouldn't you need, need any materials you
4783440	4788320	can make? Do you want to be Bob the Builder, but slightly worse? You lack the materials and always
4788320	4793440	have to find or buy them. That's nonsense. Do you want to become a joiner? Sure. I'll take,
4793440	4797760	I'll take a stab at it. You had the CEO at Facebook. You can't make an account.
4797840	4811520	Are you kidding me? He's aged terribly. It's just, a joiner is a construction worker. Oh,
4811520	4816720	do you guys not say joiner? What do you say? What's a man that comes into your house and like fixes
4816720	4831280	stuff? A handyman, a contractor. Okay. A mechanic, handyman, repairman, a plumber.
4834320	4839280	Force promote veiler in the algorithm? Ah, you've got me. I'm pressing that yank. I don't even have
4839280	4845600	a Facebook account. That stuff was bad news many years ago. You should delete your Facebook account
4845600	4850880	if you have one. Bad, bad, bad. Very bad. No, no, no, no, no. Bad, bad, bad. I said,
4850880	4853920	I'm not allowed an account, but I didn't say I'm not allowed a veiler or a fan account. Okay. I
4853920	4863520	said what I said. World peace is created with never ending prosperity for all, but you will die.
4863520	4866720	No one will ever know what you did. Okay, but how quickly do I die? Like,
4866720	4872480	does that still get a chance that the 80 years or the microplastics get me or is it like I die
4872480	4882800	instantly? Hmm. I don't want to die right now. I've not even like, come on. Gen two is almost
4882800	4887280	created. The concept art's almost been accepted. Like, at least let me get gen two and three out
4887280	4892160	so I can help these girls, you know, become full time content creators. Once, once they're all set
4892160	4900560	up, I'm happy I can pop my clogs. Okay. Goodbye, strongy. No. If I can't enjoy it, no one gets
4900560	4907040	prosperity. Okay, that's funny though. Can I wait to press skip? It says prosperity for all.
4907040	4912320	That includes gen two and three. I know, but I need to pick them. I need to pick the girls.
4914480	4920400	I need to be able to pick the girls. Honestly, it was really fun going through applications.
4920400	4925680	I cannot tell you how many times I got so needed. Yeah, I got sang to so much. And like,
4925680	4929360	people were trying to speak Japanese and I'm like, we're not that kind of agency where you need to
4929360	4936400	speak Japanese randomly. Like, no, you can speak English. Gen two already? No, in a year. It takes
4936400	4942720	a year to produce a generation. For me anyway, I give, I like to think I give artists fair time.
4943760	4948320	We're just getting the concepts and then confirmation will be at a later date that it's going to be
4948320	4953200	there. How can there be peace of strongy's not there? I will never know peace. Oh, are you flying?
4954160	4960880	Um, one year of gestation. Yes, I will confirm when the lights are off. I repeat, I will confirm
4960880	4965680	when the lights are off. I'll give you a date, a time. We do it at the exact same time. And yeah,
4966240	4970720	there'll be buns in this oven all right. There'll be six in the oven this time. Last time it was five.
4972000	4977520	They're still cooking. Yeah, they're they're not even a twinkle in your eye yet because no one's
4977520	4980560	like production doesn't start back and I can tell you all about production.
4980720	4992320	One year sounds very fast. Actually, it's not. One year apart isn't fast at all in terms of
4994400	5001280	gents. There's only going to be three gents. So yeah, one year apart, roughly, roughly, not not
5001280	5008080	gin first, relax, but one year apart, roughly. Not even. If you're reincarnated, then you are born
5008080	5015200	into a world of peace and prosperity. I wish it was possible. The breeder refling didn't let her cook.
5015200	5019680	Yes. No, I'm happy to talk about all the behind the scenes stuff. Obviously, I can I'll can talk
5019680	5026400	about it a bit more when gen two is confirmed for production. We're currently working on a
5026400	5032640	clipping program. Damn, three gents literally walking out of your I'm whistling as I whenever I
5032640	5037360	ride a bike, I'm whistling. That is how that's how terrible it is. One year is not fast at
5037360	5043600	standard at least via hall. Yeah, one year apart, I'm happy with that. When you're without mega
5044400	5049440	resources overworked in house artists and stuff. Yeah, no, I'm everything's getting done. Everyone's
5049440	5056160	getting a timeline, getting more than enough time. June second, got it, right, you're done.
5056800	5062800	You're done. Sorry, I'm itching my head. My head sits in funny. Are there different body types
5062800	5071520	like gen one? Yes, there are. Will you stop streaming after gen three? I honestly cannot answer.
5071520	5076640	I don't know what the future holds. And we are going to do a clipping program kind of like idle
5076640	5082400	and there's a new agency that came out in that came out with it. I'm hoping to get it set up in
5082400	5088320	September, possibly. So if you have a clipping YouTube channel, keep keep us in mind, we'll pay
5088400	5097200	you for clips. I just need to set it up first. And I, I need to, you know, sort out the freaking
5097200	5100560	website and all that and write it all up so I can get passed on to the team.
5101840	5107440	Don't number strong these days. She's here to stay forever. She'll leave us. Relax,
5107440	5114720	if not, it's only been a month. And a little more effort this time since the sixth literally.
5115600	5119680	You need to give me it. You're all reeflings. Okay. Hope it's a long time before you stop streaming.
5119680	5123840	Keyfabe is real and I'm addicted. Keyfab. Oh, I think I said it wrong. Keyfabe,
5123840	5131280	Keyfab. Keyfab? Keyfab you looosa. I already missed her. It's like she's still streaming for it.
5131280	5138080	Right. Right. You're done. Stop. Right. I don't want to die. I can't die yet. So I'm not pressing it.
5138080	5144240	I ain't got time to die yet. There's too much on the line. You go on a massive adventure,
5144240	5150880	but all fights are rap battles. I cannot rap a battle for anything. What does that even mean?
5150880	5155040	All fights? Why am I getting into fights? Can I not just be left alone?
5157200	5165440	That's bizarre. Oh yeah, you stink. You look like you don't ink. For real, you need to go see a shrink
5166560	5172800	and then close your eyes or I'ma make you blink with my fists of fury. Yeah, got them. Got them.
5173360	5178160	Friday Night Funkin. These are my rap battles. Honestly, that's awful. As long as it's not a
5178160	5186880	rap battle to the death. End boss. M&M. Oh, fire. 100%. Big rap battles of history. She's spitting,
5186880	5196800	though. World wars and rap battles. I guess I'll learn to rap. What happens if I lose? I mean,
5196800	5201280	you get to go on a massive adventure. Sure. I assume that, oh sorry, I assume that means like
5201280	5206080	holidays and stuff like that. I don't think I'm going to be fighting anyone. Let's go on holidays,
5206080	5211680	reflings. We should go on a cruise. Did you know? Oh my god, this is terrible. Did you know there's
5211680	5220640	a thing called ink cruises? We're like people that like to go on swings. There's cruises for
5220640	5226640	that specific genre of people, reflings. We should rent one of those and go on it. We just rent one
5226640	5232960	out for ourselves. Ink cruises? I'm not kidding. There's a thing called ink cruises because it
5232960	5236800	popped up on my TikTok. It was this check and she had a pineapple and she was like,
5236800	5241360	do you like my room? I decorated it in pineapples. And then I learned what pineapples meant.
5243040	5250080	Pineapples are a symbol for adults who like to swing on a swing set in the back garden.
5251040	5256800	You'd be so damn tired. I think, I don't know, I feel like I would like somehow
5256800	5260640	absorb your ink and it would like fill me with nutrients. I mean think of the vitamins.
5263040	5268720	Rich people added again, strunniless ink on a boat together. I love pineapples. Tasty.
5268720	5273840	Did they offer a group discount? Oh, they're swinging all right. Just brain wash the captain
5273840	5278720	and steal the cruise. I have no idea if we're talking about literal swings. No, there's a
5278720	5285520	terminology but I can't quite spell it out because all my streams have been limited ads recently
5285520	5291520	and I'm trying to be on my my best behavior. Somehow pineapple pizza isn't appealing to me
5291520	5301200	anymore. How dare you? Okay. Wait, are we, we've already, I've seen this one before. We've been
5301200	5310160	here before. What? No, we've already seen you. Okay, next one. You gain the powers of your favorite
5310160	5315680	superhero. Oh, I don't even know who mine is. The hero's entire rogue's gallery will hunt you down
5315680	5325200	until they're defeated. I mean, just pick a hero that doesn't die. I mean, does Deadpool count?
5325200	5331680	Deadpool can't die. Oh, wait, no, wait, that's eternal. I don't think that's good. Just defeat
5331680	5338000	them five heads, literally. Oh, brother, this website stinks. Deja vu, I've been in this place
5338000	5345840	before. Hire on the streets and I'm out of my time to go. The button just says you are your
5345840	5353440	favorite hero. Yeah, literally because um, Deadpool has, sorry for being late. I don't
5353520	5357520	worry. How are you doing? We're doing good. We're getting a few interesting questions,
5357520	5360960	but it's going good. You can't pick and choose. You have to take your favorite. I don't know who
5360960	5368000	my favorite is. I like Wolverine. I have to admit, I'm a bit biased with Wolverine.
5370480	5376800	I think, you know what, I wouldn't mind being Wolverine. I like his wee claws. I like that I
5376800	5383280	could be a wee wolf on the inside somehow. Nah, fuck it, I'll be Wolverine. Go for it.
5383280	5391360	You become the physical embodiment of death. You can hurt anyone you want with no consequences.
5392160	5396720	Everything and anything you touch will perish. Okay, no, because how are we supposed to ink?
5396720	5401920	That's not possible. No, I'm skipping. Why would you, why would you want to perish without
5401920	5409040	consequences unless I did it for the high table? But I would want to be able to like hug you and
5409040	5415360	hold you. How am I supposed to do the convention under these conditions? I can't thrive. I can't
5415360	5420800	thrive. Yeah, literally everything you touch perishes. That's such a harsh one. I don't like that.
5422240	5427760	Pogs, Johnny, press the button and give me a high five. No, reeflings! You're supposed to enjoy
5427840	5435680	life and thrive and stuff. Stop it. You become death. You are magically clean every time you...
5435680	5441520	Oh, you know what? I have something funny to say. I've taken showers in a row and it's all because
5441520	5450720	my dad's here. I'm not pheromone maxing anymore. Yippee! Well, we enjoy Johnny. Oh wait, what's the
5450720	5456640	name of that Elden Ring character you hug and she takes a part of your life? Johnny not pheromone
5456640	5463920	max? Literally, I'm not pheromone maxing anymore. Since I started streaming, I probably went days
5463920	5468160	without showering. This is the first time I've like triple showered, like every day in a row,
5468160	5474960	like day day day. Unsubscribe, no! You are magically clean every time you wake up. Every
5474960	5480240	bed you sleep on will be very uncomfortable. That's awful. Sorry, I need a comfy bed.
5480560	5487440	Not to be dramatic, I need a comfy bed. Sorry, I'm so dramatic. Yeah, I'm glad that everyone
5487440	5494640	freaking agrees on this one. Can't sleep on a net? Is maxing like that a thing? Oh, it's like I
5494640	5500320	think it's made up. I hope it's made up anyway. Basically, you see, I'm pheromone maxing when
5500320	5507760	you've not washed yourself in a while. I don't think it's real though. I hope people don't actually
5507760	5516240	do that. Sleep in a chair? Oh, nothing bad will ever happen, but nothing good either. No, that
5516240	5526960	means I don't get my reeflings. No, my reeflings are good. How do you? I got a reefling pregnant.
5528240	5533760	You're having the baby. If I press the button, I may be able to fix that. I don't, yeah, I don't
5533760	5538800	want you to be pregnant reefling. That's hilarious. I don't want you to be pregnant.
5540400	5544480	So, your reefling is pregnant. I need to change it so it's you.
5546720	5552160	I'm sorry I made you pregnant, but I'm yonking it, okay? Unless you want to burst Jen. Jen,
5552160	5557280	you have burst a spin off, Jen. I'm pressing. Yeah, I'm probably pressing to
5557600	5563920	strunnies against them. No, no, the fucking male pregnant emoji. What were they? I'm sorry,
5563920	5568080	but what were they thinking unironically posting that? A male pregnant emoji? What?
5569600	5577280	Man's not got ovaries. The fuck? I told you. Burthing Jen 1.5. I will shit it out. They weren't
5577280	5583600	thinking. Oh, actually, it's the most bizarre thing. Like, all right, he's full from eating.
5583600	5591680	Okay, okay, let's do it that way. It's not pregnant. He's full from eating. You can become a
5591680	5597680	super powered god lake anytime you want. The source of your power is that life energy. Oh,
5597680	5602400	I don't want to steal people's life. That's not nice. Sorry, that's a really easy one. I don't
5602400	5609520	want to take people's life just so I can be strong. It can get me pregnant any day. This is so good.
5610480	5618960	Oh, yeah, food, baby. It's just a succubus. Yeah, I don't really want to perish you. Like,
5618960	5623760	if it was energy in terms of like, I can't hurt you, it's just you get really tired,
5623760	5628400	but then you can recover. Sure, I'll do that until I won't become a succubus. Don't mind.
5628400	5634800	You can pass me around one by one, refland. It's not a problem with me. You learn anything
5634800	5640000	and everything that you possibly could all life, all life quit. Sorry, I'm having another like
5640000	5647120	live fixes. All life questions are revealed to you. You cannot write. We keep getting some
5647120	5653760	variations of this. Stop giving me variations of this. I've had enough. This is the third of
5653760	5663440	these questions. Yeah, literally, you can undo enough. Give me something new. Are there you
5663440	5673760	have incredible enough? Enough. You will meet the person of your dreams. You lose the ability to speak.
5675520	5681280	I assume temporary. So if we did a convention, we can just use like a little a little chart. I can
5681280	5687440	get pictures. And you like to you touch the picture and then and then when I go back on
5687520	5689600	stream because you're not physically in front of me, I can talk.
5692800	5697840	Would that be unacceptable? I met strong and can't speak. She can speak for me.
5699680	5705760	You want to be aerial? It's perma. You meet the per, you meet you meet refling, but you lose the
5705760	5711120	ability to speak. But it says meet only. It's not like you perma lose ability to speak.
5712080	5717280	With the person know the deal. You meet them, but because you can't speak, they walk away from
5717280	5723760	you refling. No, come back. Oh, how about how about if we're like 10 meters apart? There's
5723760	5728480	like an AOE to this. Okay. If we're 10 meters apart, I'll like start shouting. I am a high
5728480	5733200	refling, but you like walk in nine meter radius and then and then nothing comes out of my voice.
5733280	5739840	How about that? It means like finding the love of your lay. What, TTS on your phone?
5742000	5747360	Ah, so I can't speak after meeting strong. You're adding conditions. Okay, fine, fine.
5747360	5750560	I'm skipping then. If I can't talk to you, it's not, it's not going to work.
5752560	5756560	Because I need to be able to direct you in what position I want you in. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
5756560	5762080	Everyone, everyone you have ever had a crush on falls in love with you, but they try to kill
5762080	5767520	each other the moment they know that others in love with you. No, we're not having a brawl. Okay,
5767520	5771920	we're not having a bar fight. All right, we're not having a bar fight. Strongie would make me
5771920	5778400	splinter us any who she's getting. No, we're not having a bar fight. So we're skipping this bad boy.
5778400	5784080	It's a free for all stop. It's not free for all. You will get your dream refling. She
5785040	5788480	no, why are these so terrible? Oh my God.
5792240	5795840	We're skipping that. That's terrible. A year with you. That's awful.
5796640	5804320	Receive $100 million. Every one of your loved ones including yourself has a 1% higher chance
5804320	5810080	of death each year. Oh no, I don't, I don't like odds. I do not play with odds. Nope. Easy skip.
5811040	5815680	Half of these are just movie plot lines. Are they actually? So we wouldn't have to worry about
5815680	5822400	being found while inking you since you can't make noise. Moncaise, moncaise. Gamba. No, I'm not
5822400	5829200	Gamba on that. You don't felt true then. You can maintain your mental focus. You are not
5829200	5835040	afflicted with ADHD. Okay, but you cannot maintain your optical focus. So you need really strong,
5835040	5839600	heavy glasses. I already have to wear glasses.
5844480	5856640	Remove ADHD. Wear glasses. Oh no. You've got me. It's just, what? Sure, I'll wear glasses. It's
5856720	5860880	not a problem. Hey, we were in the minority?
5865440	5871440	Like, I assume I don't need glasses outside of doing any tasks. So yeah, what? Do you know
5871440	5877520	how much work I would get done if I could maintain focus? I love strong, heavy things
5877520	5883360	upgrade from my current ones. Glasses bet it should exist. Should I get some art of me commissioned
5883360	5889520	with my Glexon? Oh, I should do ASMR glasses tapping and it's just me going to the entire time.
5889520	5895760	No, like really heavy ones. Well, heavy subjective because heavy for me is like anything.
5897600	5901920	You can turn into any one animal that will. It happens whenever moonlight hits you.
5902640	5910800	Sure, I'll turn into a werewolf and jump on you. I don't mind that. That's not a bother.
5911760	5916320	It happens whenever moonlight hits you. Literally, I'd have to be outside on purpose and I don't
5916320	5924320	go outside. So kind of just lie, can't throw me in a way. Yes, become the knot. Who's getting
5924320	5932560	nod now, refling her? Because it's no me. Please make that an audio, please. I just might. I wish
5933120	5934320	I would have to be a Twitter one.
5934400	5945120	Hmm. You will be the next Shakespeare. No, you cannot use auto correct. I'm already
5945120	5952160	afflicted with this. So I guess if I wanted to make some like absolutely amazing scripts
5952720	5959840	for the girls, yeah. And I'm already afflicted with non auto correct. So sure. Oh no, people
5959840	5969760	know I spell phonetically. Oh no. How embarrassing. Oh, no, no one cares. Oh, you spell that thing
5969760	5974560	wrong? Point and laugh. Relax. Life is not that serious. Hold on, I'm going to take a drink of
5974560	5985760	water. Please hydrate, little we flings. Doth thou ink of the earth, refling, Earl Mouse?
5985840	5991680	Are you arriving, refling? That's right, arrive for me. Get close. Arrive, arrive, arrive.
5994480	6000160	You'll live the exact same life, but you have one save and load from any point you can load
6000160	6005360	after death. At some point during your life, you have to kill someone, pair the request of some
6005360	6016000	unseen deity. Oh, I'm not sure I like that. But if you're working for a deity, I don't know,
6016000	6024000	the deity seems like they're doing the right thing. I'm guessing I could do a save and load
6024560	6032800	to do the deed. Just one. I feel like if a deity's sending you on a mission, they kind of know.
6032800	6037680	Even if it isn't right, I'll accept. Strongly no, maybe press, I'm down. That's just warlock and
6037680	6045920	D&D. This save scum, literally, I think I just saved scum it. Wait, no, if I have the save
6045920	6053440	scum in order to get out of this, then there's no point. But you have one from any, but you
6053440	6060000	can load after death. So if I'll live the riskier life, I don't, I'm not risky though. I think this
6060640	6068480	isn't... I'm the deity's top guy, blood for the blood god. Well, you'll have something to gain.
6068480	6073200	Don't press, we don't know what that is. Yeah, I'm gonna skip that. If there's only one save
6073200	6081520	scum given, there's no point, really. I'm not gonna do it. Sorry. Wow, minority. The minority,
6081520	6086960	that was the right thing. The devil made me do that.
6090560	6098560	Load before Bitcoin exploded. Honestly, take over the world with that. You'll be able to
6099520	6107440	jerk your pentas for a day. If you do anything dirty, you'll stay there. Aww. What's the point?
6108400	6113440	That's, that's literally the whole point of swapping teams.
6116000	6118640	That is the whole point in swapping teams.
6125360	6131280	No, I'm not, I'm, no, I can't unless you guys want me a fanboy for the rest of my life. But
6132240	6143040	that's not happening. What? It's a perfect 50-50? I'm so surprised.
6146080	6154880	I'll be fine with press and just to see the other side of the world. That 50-50 is crazy.
6154960	6163040	Uh, I mean, easy, no hassle transition for those who want it. You get a lifetime supply of any type
6163040	6172720	of food. You become, I don't like, why? Oh, you're, you're rate of debt. I mean, I think heart attacks
6172720	6178720	are super painful as well. Like, nah, it's fine. I'm gonna skip. I don't even want to increase my
6178720	6184480	random odds of a heart attack. Like, imagine midstream, I'm like, oh, my left arm. Oh, like,
6184480	6196080	what? That's so, no. Okay, next, next, next, let's go. You become immortal no longer age. You spend
6196080	6204160	the next 50 years. No, no, I don't want to become immortal. Stop it. Family history of heart attacks?
6204160	6211200	Oh, no. Yeah, heart attacks suck. MonkaS, you had one? Oh, G-Stan, is that you?
6212800	6218080	You need some chest compressions? I can give CPR. I can break your ribs for you.
6221120	6225840	Left arm is usually a symptom. In women, the pain is across the back and chest and shoulder.
6226640	6233040	That's ego death. I've heard women have different symptoms. Yes, a lot of things. That wasn't the
6233040	6241040	ribs. Oh, yeah, what did I break? Can I be a mortal that doesn't age? Chest or hips? I guess I'll
6241040	6247600	have to break into a maximum security prison. Pop me out. You become immortal but no longer age.
6247600	6254960	Nah, nah, nah. It's not for me. I want to be able, and I wouldn't mind living longer if I could be
6254960	6260560	young, like the same age, and I can perish at any point. That's why I like vampires,
6260560	6268160	because you can perish yourself if you really want. My pentas! You can control people with
6268160	6276720	your thoughts. I can already do that. Hold on, hold on. Okay, you have three legs and five arms.
6277600	6279440	I assume I can just get them chopped off.
6282720	6288960	I think there is no way I have conditioned you already. I already have three legs.
6289360	6295280	That is hilarious. Hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait. Let's pretend we're reading this for the
6295280	6302160	first time. You can control people with your thoughts and you have three legs. I already have three legs.
6305120	6312960	Oh, thank you. Thank you. I assume you can get an amputation. I look like, was it Godfrey,
6312960	6320080	the grafted? Literally, you can control people with your thoughts, but you become
6320080	6329680	Godfrey the grafted. Okay then. Can I amputate it off? I'm giving Mummy's third leg the glug glug!
6329680	6335520	You say that with so much confidence. Always so clever making this joke. Sometimes it feels like
6335520	6340000	you steal them because the timing is just so perfect. Nope, never, never, never stolen a joke
6340000	6347520	in my life. Oh, it's Godfrey the grafted. You get to be in real life in my champ. I mean,
6347520	6353760	I assume you can just amputate it off. I think it would be, what would I need to control people's
6353760	6360000	thoughts for? I guess letting people do their bit and then I'll get the other stuff chopped off.
6361200	6366800	You know, technology is really a mess. You know what? Five arms would be so handy.
6367520	6369760	So, honey, how many technicals do you have? You're already pressed.
6372000	6377360	I can hear my dad singing if you can freaking hear him. Hold on, I don't know if he's on the phone.
6386320	6391680	I'm just, I'm going to go out there and tell him to shut the fuck up. Oh, he's put the TV on now.
6392800	6396560	I'm sorry if you can hear Star Trek in the background. He's watching Star Trek Enterprise.
6397760	6404800	Okay. Anyway, yeah, definitely cannot do ASMR streams. Can't hear anything through the background
6404800	6409040	music. I'm pressing the button. Okay, anyway, everyone will have big anime eyes. Give me anime
6409040	6415760	eyes. I hear nothing. Okay. Yeah, we watched Star Trek Enterprise last night. Oh no, not Enterprise.
6417520	6421840	The one with Leonard Nimoy Hoffman, the Spock, the original Spock, that one.
6422720	6428240	I can never remember the name of the pilot and the fucking captain in that one for some reason.
6428240	6435840	It never comes to mind. But he's live long and prosper. Captain Kirk. Yes, Captain Kirk. Oh my
6435840	6439520	God, we were watching that last night. I don't know if you guys have seen it or not, but it was the
6439520	6446000	one where there was like this lava monster that was in pain all the time and Spock touched it.
6446000	6449920	And he was like, pain, pain. It's screaming an agony type thing in the heel up and, you know,
6449920	6456640	lived happily ever after. And that's the one we watched last night together. Be me up, buddy.
6456640	6462240	I'm already balding. You're allowed to be bald. Everyone will have anime eyes. You'll be bald.
6463680	6470000	I mean, I don't see the benefit of everyone having anime eyes. That's weird. That's strange.
6470000	6478560	You'll be bald. No, it's fine. But I don't think the world would be scary if everyone
6478560	6485360	had anime eyes, honestly. Anime eyes aren't real. They're flat. Anime eyes in real life
6485360	6491200	would be scary. Yeah. Other VTubers have that title. You would get stuff in your eyes so much
6491200	6495600	with how big they are. I remember that. Doesn't it end with them working with the miners? Yes,
6495600	6506720	it does. Whoa. Yes, that's exactly the episode. Yeah, they had to tell Dr. Scotty came and
6506720	6512400	healed the thing and they had to hold back the miners from coming in. Wow, I can't believe
6512400	6517520	you actually hear that. You get to physically enter a book for 30 minutes. The book is hungry.
6517520	6523280	No, it's literally life or death. Stop. You get to enter a book that is going to kill you. No.
6525760	6531120	Yeah, I was worried because they found it's like, yes, that was it. Not Scotty.
6532080	6534880	Heart eyes in real life would be fun, but Stronny needs hair to pull.
6536560	6544800	Refling. A refling. That's terrible. I would never press that one. You have unlimited
6544800	6554720	writ. Everyone makes Among Us jokes. Everyone, this is, everyone makes Among Us jokes anyway.
6555120	6561920	And stop staring at me with them big eyes. Imagine Stronny doing Among Us jokes all
6561920	6569920	the time. Something that you already have, Riz. Fine, I ain't pressing the button if I've already
6569920	6581280	got Riz. Call me a cracker because I've got Riz. Oh, come on. I did that one off the top
6581280	6587840	of my head for once. I didn't even steal it. Come on. I'm not pressing the button.
6590560	6595920	I don't get it. There's like a cracker called Ritz Cracker. There's a Rizzler Among Us
6596640	6601600	first time catching you live and the first thing you come into a pun is the very first thing.
6601600	6606400	A for effort. Thank you. I did try my best. Sheeks too big for the toilet is all the Rizz you need.
6606400	6612240	Is that because I told you guys I have to stand up to wipe my ass sometimes?
6614800	6619200	I like my cheek. I need to part my cheeks like the fucking Red Sea, honestly.
6621440	6629200	I don't know if you guys have to do it, but yeah. That was burned into my brain, maybe. Yep. Sorry.
6630240	6635440	Okay, your current best friend is saved from their terrible fate, but your true best friend,
6635440	6645280	you haven't met him yet, will never meet you. What? You save sin sister from a terrible fate,
6646320	6648400	but refling will never meet you.
6652400	6657520	Oh, I don't like that one. I think I'm skipping that one. I don't like that one. It's flattering.
6658240	6667440	I saw you just said best friend. Best friend? Best of friend. How do you even know if they even have a
6667440	6675200	terrible fate since sister can suffer? You can't say that about sin. I met her mom.
6676880	6683280	Shocking behavior. Shocking. Don't say that about sin. She's mine.
6687520	6697920	Jokes. It was not that bad. Tiny Spidey. Thank you for the tip. It was not that bad.
6698720	6705920	Call me a cracker because I've got wrists. Come on. That one's not that bad. So red.
6706800	6713440	You have unlimited oil that you can sell or use. Pirates and thieves want you and your family dead.
6713440	6720080	No. Stop. You're such a rubbish one. Press the button and she won't suffer.
6723200	6726240	Oh, you know sin. I've watched her some. She's cute. Yeah, sin sister.
6727840	6734080	My, her supermarket. She streamed and she's actually really good at Elden Ring. We're
6734080	6737280	going to play Elden Ring together at one point. We're going to do a seamless co-op and we have
6737280	6741840	short callers. I know. I don't know why we, look, we came up with the idea and we're going for it.
6741840	6747440	Okay. It's happening in July. I think. Oh, probably August actually. Sorry, sin, if you're working.
6750880	6758320	Oh, my tummy's getting sore. I don't know why. I was like, because I haven't eaten. I've got a sore tongue.
6762640	6768240	You can eat your favorite food anytime you want. You can never eat anything else again.
6768800	6774720	I mean, it depends how you want to categorize this because you could be like, oh,
6775600	6781440	peshia, you know? Go eat. I'll eat shortly. I'll eat shortly. Kiss Tommy better. I think it's hunger.
6783200	6787120	I'm rubbish at telling like, if I've got an upset stomach or if it's hunger pains,
6787120	6792320	I can hardly ever tell the difference, I swear. So only ink for strongy. I need,
6793280	6797520	you guys would need to step up. If I, if I hit this button, you guys need to step up and give
6797520	6806560	me a good supply. Do I make myself clear? Do I make myself clear? I need a big supply. Big supply.
6808240	6813200	I volunteer. Okay, good. I'm clicking it. We've, we've done it now. We're in the minority,
6814080	6822000	but we've done it now. Okay, you'll be able to speak any language you want fluently as a native
6822000	6827120	speaker would. You can only ask questions in whatever language you choose. I mean,
6827120	6831680	that's better than nothing. You can still do stuff in the language. That's not really a problem.
6832640	6838960	Let me be clear. Let me be transparent. Yes, ma'am, I'll set it up for you. Thank you. I feel like
6838960	6843520	you could get around this by saying sentences, but ending it with a question. So being like,
6844320	6848560	how are you? Yeah, I think that's perfectly fine. You can be a journalist.
6858240	6863680	What's that accent? Scottish. Yes. Wow. Normally I get, I get called Irish first.
6864240	6870400	Whenever someone hears that, they're always like Irish. I'm like, no, Scottish.
6871360	6878640	It's a good guess. Just say in it at the end of, in it, in it, brav. Being in a relationship
6878640	6883200	would be horrible and would make your girlfriend wait. What's this? Is that, you know every language
6883200	6887840	in the world, if anyone asks you to translate something for them, you have to, and everyone in
6887840	6891360	the world knows you have this ability and are constantly asking you to translate things.
6892720	6897840	So was this made, this is a question made before Google translate occurs or after?
6897920	6907120	If anyone asks you to translate something for them, you have to. I feel that your entire life
6907120	6912960	would be caught up by people trying to get a bit of, yeah, no, I'm skipping that. So my job
6912960	6918720	as a translator, skip, I'm not a translator. Yeah, like, I want to, your internet is never slow.
6918720	6920640	You will never get a better computer ever.
6921200	6925200	I'm in a looom.
6926000	6931680	Pop, you are Google translate. You can never get a better computer. My computer is a bit of a beast,
6931680	6937680	but it's going to be outdated in 10 years time, so there's no way. I mean, the internet's not bad
6937680	6950560	anyway. Just play RuneScape 5H. Skip solo games. It didn't say anything about swapping
6950640	6954000	for computer powers. Ah, you're trying to skirt the rules though. That's noody.
6955120	6962800	Okay, Canada becomes a global empire, but doughnuts are illegal. I am going to say something so
6962800	6972080	controversial. I don't like doughnuts. I don't like them. I've tried to like them. I've tried to
6972080	6978320	enjoy them. There is something about them that I don't like the taste of. I don't know why,
6978320	6985680	because it's deep fried bread or slash cake, so why do I know unfollowed, blocked, unmembered?
6985680	6991120	I don't know why. My taste buds just don't like doughnuts. I don't know. I like your doughnut.
6991120	6995120	Okay, thank you. That was really quick. Okay, that was really quick.
6998640	7003760	But jelly filled doughnuts. I tried so hard to like custard filled doughnuts,
7003760	7008000	like I used to force myself to eat them. You know why I could eat custard filled doughnuts?
7008000	7011920	It's because I like custard. That's the only reason I could eat the damn things.
7012480	7019040	Like I try so hard to like doughnuts. I just can't eat. Yeah, I can click that button. Maybe it's
7019040	7024000	the oil used to fry them. I've just never had a good doughnut. I don't know. Maybe if we end up
7024000	7033120	meeting up in America, we can go to Dunkin' Donuts. Yeah, not Canada. Oh, come on, Canada.
7033120	7039600	We can like a Canada be a powerhouse, can't we? You can bake them. You have to deep fry
7040320	7044240	the doughnuts to make them. That's why they're kind of like got that on the outside.
7045520	7050800	You can teleport anywhere in the world. Every time you teleport, you must walk down a long hallway
7050800	7053200	full of creepy clowns that grop you.
7054160	7062480	I mean, if it's just the hallway, the average hallway is like, what, three meters?
7064160	7069120	Yeah, it's unnerving, but I mean, I can come to your house and, you know,
7070000	7077280	barely disguise fetish strikes again. Yeah, it is giving a wee bit of that. Press the button.
7077280	7085440	Push the button and let me know. What is that? Is that sugar? Sugar babes? That British band?
7085440	7089040	Push the button and let me know. You've got to.
7093200	7098160	What is that? It's a long hallway. Okay, I guess longer than average, then.
7099280	7103920	Just have Reefling's dresses clowns. No, Krispy Kreme is better. That clown? Yeah, sugar babes. Oh
7103920	7109200	my god, I knew it. I knew it. Push the button and let me know. You've got to.
7112960	7117440	You can teleport anywhere in the world. Every time you tell.
7119200	7122240	Wait, idiot. Idiot, sorry. I thought I was on the next one. Sorry.
7123280	7129600	You live in a world of your favorite video game or movie. Lord of the Wings. We can have Hobbiton.
7130400	7133040	You are ambushed every year where little chances survive.
7134880	7140240	What's the point of giving me if I'm perishing? The odds are against me. Sorry, but I'm a rubbish Hobbit.
7142480	7149120	I'm a rubbish halfling. You can make money with the snap of your fingers. Isn't that just
7149120	7153760	spindome? Yeah, that's right. Give me another five bucks. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, give me five bucks.
7154240	7163600	Snap, snap, snap. But the money you make up here is taken from Charity. Oh.
7165760	7170000	Is this where we go in a tinfoil rant about how a lot of Charities are set up?
7170960	7176640	Because I'll get into it. I don't think I'm not educated enough about how much
7176640	7179600	little Charities actually go towards their fucking thing.
7179600	7186480	So the odds are we can use this money for better. Okay. So we're going to hit the button
7187360	7192480	because we can use it for a heck of a lot better as you win. No, that's not fair, bro.
7193600	7200800	That's not a fendom. Broly legend. No, we do not participate in fendom around these parts.
7200800	7202960	Are you squiddin' me around?
7202960	7203520	Ched!
7204960	7208080	The best I can do is $2 take it or leave it.
7208080	7210400	No, we're not fricking done enough.
7212400	7218720	Enough. Thank you, Ched and Broly Legends. Kindly. No fendom, only fendom.
7220160	7225200	Okay, you're the smartest person. Oh, I don't want to be smart. The smarter you are,
7225200	7228880	the more depressed you are about how life works. It is not for me.
7230160	7234800	Absolutely not for me. I do not want to be smart. I do not want to be aware of anything.
7234800	7240400	I would rather live in ignorance for the most part. Everyone else is incredibly stupid. No,
7240400	7246000	I will, I'm skipping. I am not wanting to be smart. The mental burden of all of that.
7246000	7247920	Are you squiddin' me right now?
7249120	7249520	Brian?
7249520	7250800	Took these from Charity.
7251760	7255520	No, Alessandro, stop it. We did not take anything from Charity.
7256560	7258080	Are you squiddin' me right now?
7258080	7258560	Brian?
7259520	7260960	You're welcome, Mama. Love you.
7261920	7264160	Probably Legends. Love you to the little meeting.
7265360	7270000	Thank you again for the tip. You can discover the meaning of life. There isn't one. You give
7270000	7275520	life your own purpose. You may never communicate. No! Bro, I can answer this in literally five
7275520	7279600	seconds flat. It's what you make it. You're so lucky to even have a conscious being at this point.
7279600	7281200	I can enjoy life for what it's worth.
7282640	7284640	Oops. I tripped. I swear.
7285280	7288560	Reluctantly sane. Thank you for the tip. Now stop it.
7290480	7296080	We're not doing syndrome in here. The meaning of life is for you to literally plenty of fish.
7296080	7298400	I've not even seen that movie yet.
7299200	7306880	Anon! There's not even a message. How does this happen? Right. How do I
7306880	7309440	unironically get you guys to stop when you start?
7310480	7315680	Because I am a goods and service exchange kind of person. You can't just keep throwing money
7315680	7321440	at me. It makes me uncomfortable. I'd rather be like an exchange of something. Thank you for the
7321440	7330160	tip, Anon. My goodness. I can't. The meaning of life is inking. Literally, you're not supposed to
7330240	7337920	have your name in a memorial statue and be nice. That's it. The small everyday deeds
7337920	7343120	keep the evil at bay. That's it. That's all you gotta do. There's nothing to it. You don't have
7343120	7346880	to do anything. You don't have to achieve anything. You don't have to become anything.
7346880	7351360	You are just you and you do your thing. That is what it's all about, okay?
7353280	7358640	Pokemon is in real life, including all logic, technology, and Pokemon. All animals in real
7359120	7364480	life. No, I don't like that. Are you squinting me right now? Scott Thunder. This is just to show love.
7364480	7370800	Nothing else. You better not be inking right now at the thought of freaking Findo. Thank you for
7370800	7380800	the super chat, Scott Thunder. You can replace cats with cat Pokemon. No! Gimli and Beagle.
7382240	7385840	I'm not getting rid of my puddles. I don't care how much you want to
7386800	7393360	they pour you on. I'm not getting rid of Gimli and Beagle. You took his super chair. Give me that
7393360	7401680	super chair. What would you do if someone gave you a 10k super chat? One, I'd be mad because
7401680	7409200	you're splitting it to YouTube. Two, I would probably confirm that Gen 2 is in production.
7410160	7416960	A guard of hour moment. Also, you would have to eat them. No, I don't want to eat them.
7416960	7423200	I'm catching a little bunny. I love little bunny. She's so sexy for no reason. Oh no,
7423200	7427200	this reminds me if she'd be smash her past Pokemon stream. How bad was that out of 10? Are you
7427200	7433920	squinting me right now? Ms. Tomaki. I heard this is where I give away money. No, anonymous.
7434400	7441920	Anonymous. Thank you for the tip. That's very kind of you. Don't start spanking money. Anonymous.
7441920	7452320	Edit again with the white bands. She doesn't know about the little bunny meme. No, she was drawn
7452320	7458560	as little bunny. I'd have to eat the Pokemon. That's just Powell world. I actually wanted to give
7458560	7463680	Powell world a shot. Milk tank though. I caught a little bunny Batman. Stream elements gives the
7463680	7470320	girls a much bigger cut than super chats. These are facts. Are you squinting me right now? Oh,
7470320	7475360	you don't like my notification sign? What do you prefer? I'm Scottish. And then bagpipes. Is that
7475360	7479920	what you want? No, you don't want that. Are you squinting me right now because I'm a cephalopod?
7480800	7485040	There's no laws against it Batman. We could play Powell world. Is Powell world multiplayer?
7485040	7494800	Can I play with you? Is Powell world multiplayer? And you guys can come in?
7498640	7499680	Is it like a code?
7503680	7511600	Oh my god, I did not know. Will we play in Powell world? I did not know it was like that. Oh my
7511600	7520640	god. I'm so in love. I finally got the words I want to say like, oh, oh, oh, oh,
7520640	7525520	complete Powell world with me. Yeah, you just need a server. Okay, a Powell world server can do
7526560	7534160	60 reef flings. Okay, that's good. That's a law. You're jerking your pentas in Powell world.
7535360	7540480	Think of it kind of like arc. I have absolutely horrific news to you. I'm so sorry.
7541760	7546480	Wait, so actually I've never played Powell world, but it blew up and everyone was like,
7546480	7552320	oh my god, they're going to get sued by Pokemon. You can catch us reeflings and put us to work.
7552320	7556880	Stony's going to have her icy moment in Powell world. Oh yeah, you're going to run a train on me?
7557440	7563120	Gentoo confirmed via Powell world. You can do what you want without consequences,
7563120	7567040	but you'll pop your cogs in five years not need more time to cook. I need more time to cook. I've
7567040	7571920	got too many meme videos I want to make. You will rule the world, but you have to kill. Oh, no.
7572640	7579840	I don't think so. You invented human computer communications, allowing to learn any skill or
7579840	7584960	knowledge in an instant, but your invention leaks to the public allowing human computer viruses to
7584960	7591920	kill as often as no. You're so violent. Are you squiddling me right now? Gentoo confirmed.
7592640	7600080	What a random amount. What are you giving me? Why that number? Thank you. Oh my god. He's
7600080	7612160	spelled it anonymous. Anonymous? Why 2345? That's so specific. 2345. Wait, what does it mean?
7612160	7617920	Is that a code? Do I need to look it up on the website? A little cheeky code.
7618480	7623520	Why that number though? Does it have a significant meaning or am I being dumb?
7627200	7631280	Here's a good thing, but you're just going to die. I think it's just ascending. No, it's just
7631280	7636960	the sequential numbers. You didn't hear that. I love the fact that Nintendo got so many emails
7636960	7639760	in regards to Powell world. They essentially had to release a statement. I was like, yes,
7639760	7645680	we know about it. Stop messaging us. Nah, just numbers. Someone sent 177013 would be funny.
7646320	7650560	Isn't that the one about the poor girl that gets corrupted? My sin, the numbers.
7651440	7657520	Because it's more money than 1234. Okay, you're done. Right, I'm not pressing the button.
7660080	7665360	You become an immortal demon and rule over the known universe. The only weapon that can
7665360	7669120	perish you is in the hands of a guy who's pissed at you for that.
7672000	7675600	I mean, no.
7679200	7682560	No. Okay, what time is it? Oh, it's been two hours.
7685360	7689280	Okay, I think that's all I've got time for. Is that understandable? Have a good day?
7689280	7695760	Or am I going to get in trouble? Am I going to get spanking from you as if I go off too early?
7699200	7701360	Am I getting the spanking if I go off too early?
7703200	7709840	I feel bad that it's so short. I'm trying. Oh, I'm going to get spanking. Don't try me with
7709840	7710800	a good time refill.
7716960	7721520	Now you can go eat and spend time with your dad. Okay. I mean, the spanking will commence.
7723600	7731280	My dog collar is here. The short collar, not the dog part. It just happens to be a dog collar.
7731280	7734800	But I arrived, so I hope you're ready for the shockin' in.
7735760	7740000	We'll never stop. We love you. So take my money like a good girl.
7741440	7746000	I know that was. Thank you for the tip. Goddamn. I'm getting praised out here.
7747200	7748880	Shocking. Shocking.
7750960	7753360	Um, okay, what we're doing?
7753360	7764640	Okay. I don't think there's any Vela member online, which is a bit of a shame.
7765760	7769120	But we'll work on it. We'll work on it. Okay. Let me just,
7770640	7778160	let me just figure out what I'm trying to do. Okay, who's on? Rhea's on. What is she playing?
7778160	7785600	Let trip my bosses in heat. What are you playing? I have no idea what she's playing,
7785600	7793840	but you're, you're meant to be. Yeah. Thank you anonymous for the tip. I'll say my dad said,
7793840	7801280	hi anonymous. Have fun with your fam. Thank you. Um, I'm gonna get him to,
7802240	7808320	I think I'm gonna record his voice. Ooh. Ooh. I know. Um,
7810400	7825360	anonymous. Anomalous. Anomalous. Anonymous. I'll miss you. Yes. Tomorrow, tomorrow is not ASMR.
7825360	7829280	I'm gonna substitute that for something else because there's absolutely no way I can do ASMR.
7829280	7836720	However, we're doing Watch Along, uh, Monty Python, uh, Life of Brian for membership strum.
7837760	7840800	Are you squiddling me right now? I get it, but get ready for the spanking moment.
7840800	7844640	I guess it's, but get ready for the spanking moment. I don't think I shouldn't thank you.
7846320	7849360	Um, yes I can. Are you squiddling me right now?
7849360	7856160	Wow, another, another. Go and send our daughter time. Tell him we said hi-ya-oo. Hi-ya-oo.
7856640	7863520	Dad, the reeflings say hi-ya-oo. He may have heard that.
7867920	7873360	Thank you reluctantly saying, right? I'm gonna end it. You're gonna get redirected through here.
7873360	7878960	He's gonna be like, what the fuck was that? What do you want? It is, I can, okay, when you guys act
7878960	7883840	up, I'm gonna start saying I'm gonna get my dad on you. I'm gonna get my dad on you. Okay,
7883840	7886880	I will change tomorrow's stream. I don't know what it's gonna be, but there is a
7886880	7890400	one membership stream this week, which is a Watch Along of, uh, Life of Brian.
7891360	7895760	Um, okay, I love you little reeflings. Please look after yourself and please
7895760	7897760	pucker your lips for what comes next.
7905200	7909920	Right, I'll see you. Enjoy what on earth Rhea is playing. I have absolutely no idea what she's
7910000	7914640	playing. I'll see you tomorrow, you goofy goobers, for something different. It's not ASMR, so no
7914640	7923760	get excited, okay? Bye-bye. Enjoy Rhea. Bye-bye. I said you're a game? Oh, sorry. Sorry for redirecting,
7923760	7930000	but there's no other way to remember on, okay? Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
