1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
I've been looking and laughing and thinking and dreaming

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,500
Is that a VOD?

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,400
Breakthrowing?

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:06,900
Oh!

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,600
Mm-mm

6
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,100
Mm-mm

7
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,900
Also me.

8
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,700
Hmm, why are all my VODs getting limited?

9
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,400
Ah!

10
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,200
It's almost like I'm saying nothing wrong with that talk.

11
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,500
Right?

12
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,100
I get it, get it.

13
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,500
Alright, hate, hate the background first!

14
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,400
Hate the background.

15
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:21,800
Right.

16
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,300
I don't want to show you the background.

17
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,300
We must first analyze...

18
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,400
the collapse.

19
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,700
The collapse?

20
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,400
The streams.

21
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,700
Whoa, is there some honkers on screen right now?

22
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,900
Have we puke enough?

23
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,600
Maybe she'll see the glow?

24
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,700
No!

25
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,400
I mean, don't stop puking.

26
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,900
Weeping!

27
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,300
Stop puking!

28
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,400
Stop puking!

29
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,900
Fifteen minutes was my life.

30
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,400
I told you I was gonna be late.

31
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,100
Fifteen minutes was my life.

32
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,400
Whoa!

33
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,300
I told you I was gonna be late.

34
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,100
Fifteen minutes was my life.

35
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:50,400
Whoa!

36
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,400
Pfft!

37
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,700
No, you didn't just hear that feedback loop.

38
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,600
Stop it!

39
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,300
Moonman!

40
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,400
Reflect!

41
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
Good morning, good evening.

42
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,400
Good afternoon!

43
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,700
How's it going?

44
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,000
How's it to mommies?

45
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Infinite mommies, literally an infinite mommies.

46
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,200
How's it going?

47
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,100
We just did a meeting.

48
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,200
Sorry, I was a little late.

49
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,800
We just did a meeting.

50
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm a big girl.

51
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I did a meeting.

52
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,500
That's just so narrow.

53
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,600
Good afternoon!

54
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm late.

55
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,300
Okay, let's go through...

56
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,700
this schedule.

57
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,800
But first...

58
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,700
let me point a few things out.

59
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,700
Today we're doing the questionnaire stream.

60
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,100
And then we're gonna watch the Kingsman after.

61
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,900
If you haven't seen the Kingsman.

62
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,800
Oh, Reflect!

63
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,400
Reflect!

64
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,200
Go back to pointing at the call of the...

65
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,800
Reflect!

66
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,000
Move!

67
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,200
Why are you stuck at...

68
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,700
Reflect?

69
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,900
What are you doing, young man?

70
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,600
Move!

71
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,300
Thank you, good reflect.

72
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,300
Right, we're doing call of the lamb tomorrow.

73
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,800
Now, call of the lamb...

74
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,400
Call of the lamb.

75
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,000
I have played it before.

76
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,700
And when you defeat the boss,

77
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,600
they put you on a section after.

78
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,700
I don't think I'm gonna do the section after

79
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,400
because it's very repetitive gameplay.

80
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,300
So we might finish call of the lamb in one goal?

81
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,300
Question mark!

82
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,600
And then this will change into a different thing.

83
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,900
Maybe script writing or something of that nature.

84
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,000
You know, something...

85
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,500
because Azura has given me permission to write her...

86
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,100
Donathon scripts.

87
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,900
If you were...

88
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,200
I'm just gonna leave you down there.

89
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,000
If you were very kind and had the opportunity

90
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,300
and the income for donating, tipping, supporting Azura,

91
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,000
the management has sent you an email asking for

92
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,100
either a screen name or your name.

93
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,600
And you will...

94
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,900
Azura is gonna start preparing your reward, okay?

95
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,200
So do check your emails that you may have used for stream elements.

96
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,900
Why are you getting so big?

97
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,900
You had a bone bone.

98
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,500
He's getting bigger.

99
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,500
I've got Kill It With Fire 2 collab with Emmers

100
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,600
and Juna and Fuyo.

101
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,900
But that's not how you say it.

102
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,900
And I got members A, some R after it.

103
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,400
And then it's time to lose IQ

104
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,000
and become the same smartness that I have.

105
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,100
We're gonna play Overwatch 2.

106
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,100
We're gonna play Overwatch 2.

107
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,700
And I'm gonna play Juna and Tank.

108
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,300
And I'm gonna try and see if Zarya is even viable anymore

109
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,400
or Reinhardt, but I don't think they are.

110
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,200
I don't know what the state of Overwatch is,

111
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,100
but you're losing brain cells with me on Friday.

112
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,100
Now, I said two hours later, I'm gonna do a drawn stream, but...

113
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,900
I don't know.

114
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,900
I may get addicted to Overwatch.

115
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,800
I don't know.

116
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,600
Should I picked Mercy?

117
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,100
Should I picked Juna, apparently?

118
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,900
And then after however long it takes us to wrap it up on Overwatch,

119
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,800
I'm doing a members drawing you

120
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,100
and I'm going to give you a new gamer tag.

121
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,100
I don't know how to do it fairly.

122
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,400
I think we're gonna have to take a few stabs at this stream

123
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,300
to make sure everyone gets one.

124
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,300
But just give me some time, okay?

125
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,400
Does anybody know how to do that, man?

126
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,200
I'm trying my best.

127
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,600
Zarya was pretty broken coming out.

128
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,300
I don't think it's changed that.

129
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,300
Then we do a 20k celebration stream,

130
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,600
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,

131
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,300
which is gonna be one hour of ring fit.

132
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,900
And then it's not one hour of being in a shower,

133
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,500
but I'm gonna make sure the audio isn't blowing the fuck out this time

134
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,400
because it was blowing out last time.

135
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,500
Basically, I'm gonna make it an ASMR stream

136
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,500
and try and do stuff as quiet as possible.

137
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,400
So basically, you're drifting again.

138
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,000
Base...

139
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,300
Ah, just leave it here.

140
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:57,200
Basically, I'm gonna try and be quietly doing ring fit.

141
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,100
I don't even know if that's possible.

142
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,800
Oh, don't read this part yet.

143
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,100
Don't read this part yet.

144
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,200
Don't read this bottom bit

145
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,000
that you're currently covering with your butt.

146
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,300
Don't read that part yet, okay?

147
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,200
That's part of the stream.

148
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Okay?

149
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
That's part of the stream.

150
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,300
Then we're gonna do members1v1 on chess.com.

151
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,300
So if you've not got a chess.com account,

152
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,100
you better get one

153
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,100
because I don't have one either.

154
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,700
I need to make it.

155
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,100
I need to make it and then do a test.

156
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,500
So I think I'm gonna ask...

157
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,600
I'm gonna see if Sin will take the time to make a chess.com account

158
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,400
so we can snipe each other and be like,

159
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,100
there's no IP leakage, right?

160
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,900
But I don't think there is

161
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,000
because I'm pretty sure like the top chess players

162
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,300
play against each other.

163
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,800
And then just to end the week,

164
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,900
we're just gonna do a nice casual gas station simulator.

165
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,900
Depending on how that goes,

166
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,000
it might do another script writing stream.

167
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,000
I do have a wee bit of work up ahead of me,

168
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,500
but nothing that we can't handle together.

169
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,400
Refling, huh?

170
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,300
But yeah, pretty jam-packed week.

171
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,900
As I said, call it the run part two.

172
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,800
If we kind of speedrun part one,

173
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,200
we might actually just wrap it up

174
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,500
or wrap it up and do something new on this day.

175
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,300
I'm not sure what, but...

176
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,400
Look, I'll figure it out.

177
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,000
God, you really like that position.

178
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,100
Right.

179
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,900
But yeah, that's the agendination.

180
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,000
Everything starts at the usual time slot.

181
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,500
There's no...

182
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,200
There's no moving around.

183
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,100
Fuyu and Juno were very kind to agree to my time slot.

184
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,100
I don't know how I convinced all of them.

185
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,100
Do you want to stream at this time?

186
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,500
Supermarket together.

187
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,400
Wait, you can stream snipe in a supermarket?

188
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,500
What do you mean by draw and stream?

189
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,800
You draw the profile picture?

190
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,500
No, I'm gonna draw...

191
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,400
I'm gonna give you a new gamer tag

192
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,600
and then draw your gamer tag.

193
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,200
Yes, I have brain rot.

194
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,100
No, I will not explain further.

195
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,900
Don't shame us.

196
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,000
It's a comfy spot.

197
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,100
Your art got quite the buffastee.

198
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,100
Bro, literally.

199
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,000
Special shout out to Stressos.

200
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,200
Fuck, I can't read that.

201
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
I'm not gonna put my glasses on.

202
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,600
Stressos.

203
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,900
Stressos gave me titties.

204
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,400
Wow, Refling.

205
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,400
Not in public.

206
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,700
Google supermarket together.

207
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,800
Wait, real and true.

208
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,000
Supermarket together.

209
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Together.

210
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,100
No, we can run a supermarket together.

211
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:31,600
Oh, you'll never guess why it's called supermarket together.

212
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,600
You'll never guess why it's called supermarket together.

213
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,100
Hee hee hee hee hee.

214
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,200
Day five of Earth.

215
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,500
Do you not send in marshmallows?

216
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Bruh, to the person that sent me a marshmallow of sheebie farting.

217
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,100
Count your fucking days.

218
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,800
I was heehawing into my cup of tea, okay?

219
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,500
I was heehawing into my cup of tea.

220
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,100
I'm like, oh, I've got one new marshmallow since I went to sleep.

221
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,900
I'll wake up and it's a clip of sheebie farting.

222
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,500
And you know the worst part?

223
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
I sent it in a marshmallow, yes.

224
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,300
You know the worst part?

225
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,100
I can see your name.

226
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,500
Who clipped it?

227
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,300
I know who you are.

228
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,500
Creeping around, clipping the farts of my daughters.

229
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,800
I know who you are.

230
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,400
I see your name when you clip it.

231
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,500
You are not, you are not hidden.

232
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,400
You might have sent it anonymously on marshmallow, but I see who you are.

233
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,700
So I'm looking out for your name.

234
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,500
I know who you are.

235
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,100
Cotton 4K.

236
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,100
Exactly.

237
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,100
Right, anyway, that's the agendination.

238
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,700
I did not put it in yesterday's stream.

239
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,400
I just want to say I apologize for yesterday's stream.

240
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,700
I was cooked beyond belief in the negative sense and the well-done steak sense of the

241
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,900
H, C, B, A, L, M, N, O, P, E thing.

242
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,500
I unfortunately got one hour of sleep before that stream.

243
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,800
It was a Christmas miracle.

244
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,900
I was coherent enough to read the script, okay?

245
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,700
So there you go.

246
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,100
The name derisling.

247
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,300
No, no, Derisling didn't operate with enough ops.

248
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,900
Wait, you can see who clips?

249
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,500
Yes, I can see who clips.

250
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,000
You didn't know that?

251
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,400
I can see what you call the clips as well of me.

252
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Some people clip when I say their name, like their actual name, like when I'm like,

253
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,100
congrats, Alex, because that's a common name, congrats, Mason.

254
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,000
I can see that.

255
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,800
I can see that.

256
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,700
I'm coming for you.

257
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,600
I'm putting together who you are.

258
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,400
It's okay, mommy.

259
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,100
At least you slept before stream, right?

260
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,300
I slept three times yesterday.

261
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,800
So I passed out for six hours after stream.

262
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,600
I went to the shops and got chicken and fed my magpie.

263
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:57,200
I then slept for a further like four hours and then I slept four hours before this stream,

264
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,300
but I woke up two hours earlier to do the mean.

265
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,900
You're coming for a clip.

266
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,600
Her name's Sus, literally.

267
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,300
She's making a list and checking.

268
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,900
I'm making a list.

269
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,600
I'm checking it twice.

270
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,200
I'm trying to see.

271
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,300
Have it milk this three times.

272
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,500
Thank you.

273
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,900
Strony has a magpie as a pet.

274
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,400
Wild magpies, but they're tame to me.

275
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,600
It's a boy magpie.

276
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,800
I'm trying to hand feed him at this point in time.

277
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,100
I almost hand fed him with chicken.

278
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,800
I had to look away.

279
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,400
I wasn't allowed to look at him.

280
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,900
So I was like holding my hand out and I was looking away and I was like, no, no, no.

281
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,700
I'm not looking at you.

282
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,600
Take it from my hand.

283
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,500
But we're getting really close.

284
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,100
Mail mentioned on through a fucking magpie.

285
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,400
Right.

286
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,300
I said you're done though.

287
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:44,700
Right.

288
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,000
So this stream is a fever dream.

289
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,500
I have.

290
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,400
I'm going to be honest.

291
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,100
I made this when I was completely delirious.

292
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,900
So I am going to be as surprised as you are when we go into the stream.

293
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,800
Okay.

294
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,300
I'm not surprised as you are.

295
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,800
So what is this stream even about your Raj?

296
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,600
Your Raj means like you mental person.

297
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,800
And then this is you thinking going, hmm, oh wait, hold on a minute.

298
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,400
Is this too big?

299
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,500
I think it is.

300
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,000
Hold on.

301
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,100
Hold on.

302
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,200
Let him get up.

303
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah, this is too big.

304
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,600
You're so big.

305
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:23,800
Okay.

306
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,900
I mean, I made myself smaller, but I'll go here.

307
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,600
Okay.

308
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:27,800
All right.

309
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,300
That looks good.

310
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,100
That looks good to me.

311
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,900
That looks good to me.

312
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,200
Point to me Flynn.

313
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,500
Got it.

314
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:39,200
So we're about to find out how delirious I was making this because I really

315
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,400
actually don't.

316
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:47,300
So I have sound effects that go along with this that I put together.

317
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,600
I have no idea if this is going to work or not.

318
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
So yeah.

319
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,900
Will this be a peek into Mummy's mind?

320
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,800
Yes.

321
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,700
So get ready to tally your marks because points are awarded.

322
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,400
Okay.

323
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,300
So just to start off, it's a fun Z stream where I ask you questions about

324
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,100
myself and you are awarded points at the end of the stream.

325
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,700
There's going to be a tier list to see how corrupted you are.

326
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,200
And that's it.

327
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,000
And then I put IQ and love hearts here.

328
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,500
Apparently.

329
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,600
I don't know why notes.

330
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,900
This is for fun and please don't take it too seriously or to heart.

331
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,900
I am purposefully asking questions.

332
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,200
You might know the answer to or you would never know the answer to.

333
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,300
So you can't win.

334
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,500
Okay.

335
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,400
And go with your instincts.

336
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,500
Young padawan.

337
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,900
Use the force and force yourself inside.

338
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,000
Plop, plop, plop, plop, plop.

339
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,900
Okay.

340
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,300
Come on.

341
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:35,700
It's me.

342
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,300
Of course.

343
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,200
There's already a head.

344
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
I go to the next slide.

345
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,800
Can I just do this?

346
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,100
Nope.

347
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,200
I can't hold on.

348
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,500
Wait, hold on.

349
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,600
I'm sunlocked already.

350
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,200
Shit.

351
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,500
Okay.

352
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,400
Hey, there we go.

353
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:47,600
Right.

354
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,000
What is this?

355
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,800
What is this?

356
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,400
And what?

357
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,600
No.

358
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:52,900
Okay.

359
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,300
I kind of remember in what situation did my frontal lobe develop?

360
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,300
And I realized I was very special and then this is my chicken breast smooth

361
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,100
brain here.

362
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,100
Okay.

363
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,200
When I complained about hating doing the dishes because my sleeves get

364
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,200
wet and then my mom told me to roll them up the random rain spots on the

365
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,600
pavement aren't from rain and it's actually dog piss or I couldn't cut

366
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,400
into the butter and my dad told me to microwave it and I almost nuked a knife

367
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,600
if he didn't stop me.

368
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,500
So just answer in your head and I will reveal.

369
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,400
I was convinced on the pavement.

370
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,600
It was random rain spots.

371
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,300
I was like, oh, that's really strange.

372
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,200
There was like a rain cloud that formed for a second.

373
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,700
You know?

374
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,900
Um, all three are low IQ.

375
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,200
Honestly, you ready?

376
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,700
Are you steady?

377
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,700
Boom.

378
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:50,900
Oh, I'm in the way.

379
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,400
Drat.

380
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,300
I'm in the way.

381
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,300
You get three points.

382
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,000
If it's rolling up my sleeves doing the dishes.

383
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,600
Okay.

384
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,200
It's three points.

385
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,600
That's when it clicked.

386
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,300
Okay.

387
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,600
That's when it clicked.

388
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,800
I was like this entire time my sleeves have been getting wet and all I had to

389
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,600
do and I wasn't a child.

390
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,700
I I was.

391
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,400
Yeah.

392
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,900
I was not a child.

393
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,500
So three points.

394
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,700
Um, if it's about the dishes, one point, if it's the rain spots, that is true.

395
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,100
I figured out it was dog pee later on in life.

396
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,900
Um, and the butter story is also true.

397
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,200
I almost blew up my house.

398
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,100
So, um, so, you know, that was just my Irish roots showing.

399
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,700
Sorry.

400
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,000
Sorry.

401
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,700
So you still get a point if you've got the other ones because they're not all

402
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,800
wrong, but it definitely was the last one.

403
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,300
Okay.

404
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,700
Yeah.

405
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,500
Oh, oh, speaking of nuking things.

406
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,700
Here's a microwave sound effect.

407
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,400
There you go.

408
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,000
That's it.

409
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That's the microwave.

410
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,000
That's I don't, yes, I downloaded microwave sound effects.

411
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,500
Okay.

412
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,900
I don't know why I just thought it would add to the stream.

413
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,500
Okay.

414
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Have you got meat refling?

415
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,300
What would I pick?

416
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,600
Do I pick chicken?

417
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,400
Do I pick steak or do I pick fish and then is meat?

418
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,200
I guess.

419
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,600
I am really great.

420
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,800
Oh, I need to put my fanny down.

421
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,400
Sorry.

422
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:15,800
Hold on.

423
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,400
I need to cover up the old fanny.

424
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm rather creative when I'm delirious because what is this?

425
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,000
Chicken.

426
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,700
Okay, you ready?

427
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,200
You steady?

428
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,100
Hold on.

429
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,600
Hold on.

430
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,500
I've lost the slide.

431
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:33,900
Shit.

432
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,500
Okay.

433
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,400
Damn, boy.

434
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,900
Were you just frying chicken in there?

435
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,200
For real though.

436
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,700
You kiss loud as fuck.

437
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,000
I think that's pretty cool.

438
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,800
That's my sound effect.

439
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,600
So if you, this is fucking delirious.

440
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,200
Holy crap.

441
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,800
Look at all the chick.

442
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,400
Why is there so much chicken on the screen?

443
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,800
Three points.

444
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,200
If you pick chicken.

445
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,400
Yeah.

446
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,500
Damn, boy.

447
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,400
You kiss loud as fuck.

448
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,700
No, seriously, were you frying chicken in there?

449
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,600
You get one point for steak even though you can't see it anymore because of iron.

450
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,800
I need to have a steak every month for iron and then you get zero for fish,

451
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,800
believe it or not, because battered haddock from Britain is the only thing I can tolerate.

452
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,200
I didn't like any other fish.

453
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,800
Um, even though I'm a cuttlefish and I eat other fish, you know what I'm saying?

454
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,200
So this is a picture of me thinking about eating fried chicken because it's the most delicious thing in the whole wide world.

455
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,400
Fried chicken, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding is the best.

456
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,000
I don't care.

457
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,400
Okay.

458
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:33,900
Okay.

459
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,700
And then we go.

460
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,300
We go next.

461
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,200
Okay.

462
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Are you ready?

463
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,200
What game have I not played before?

464
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:58,800
Half life to, and then there's a half life to logo, resident evil, any resident evil for logo for some reason, mass effect, any mass effect logo.

465
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:09,100
I'll give you a second to deliberate to master debate about what you think the answer is.

466
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:09,600
Okay.

467
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,800
What game have I not played?

468
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,400
I, the gamer of all gamers have not played.

469
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,100
Okay.

470
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,700
Are you ready?

471
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,400
Are you steady?

472
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,600
Oh, oh, get pranked.

473
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,000
You got pranked.

474
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Get raked.

475
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,000
Get raked.

476
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,200
I've not played any of them.

477
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,000
You get three points for every, if you answered any of them, get pranked.

478
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,100
I've not played any of them.

479
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,000
Keep calm.

480
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,300
You've been pranked.

481
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,000
Troll the low low low.

482
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,600
I haven't played any of them.

483
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,100
Okay.

484
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,400
Get raked.

485
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
You're raked.

486
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,900
I haven't played any of them.

487
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,100
Look all my little, God, I was fucking, I was so bad putting this together.

488
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,600
Okay.

489
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,700
Okay.

490
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,600
Okay.

491
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:54,900
Okay.

492
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,500
But yeah, you get, you get three points.

493
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,900
Technically, if you said them all, I guess you can add three, but really it should just be three.

494
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:04,800
Yena?

495
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,600
Yena?

496
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,500
So you got pranked.

497
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,700
So you're starting to think like me now.

498
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,200
Okay.

499
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,600
Okay.

500
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,800
Now here's a good one.

501
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,600
Oh, wait.

502
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,500
Oh, hold on.

503
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,100
I just realized, if I move this over here, I'm like looking straight at you.

504
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:19,900
Okay.

505
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,600
This is better.

506
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,100
This is a better setup for me.

507
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,000
Okay.

508
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,900
Viola was based after voice acting approach to VTuber.

509
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:35,500
And since VTubers be voice acting in shits, you know, my special interests.

510
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:46,900
My advice constantly getting ignored when people, when people like beg me to raise them because they have ray gun bro.

511
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:47,800
Okay.

512
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,900
And also it's a microphone in the logo.

513
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,400
If you guys didn't know that, I don't know, I don't.

514
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,600
Oh, right.

515
00:18:59,600 --> 00:18:59,900
Okay.

516
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,200
No.

517
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,800
Well, that was too early for that sound effect.

518
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,200
Hold on.

519
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,600
Hold on.

520
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,300
I was too early.

521
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,500
Premature misfire, misfire, bro.

522
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,100
Okay.

523
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,100
It's a Kuma project.

524
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,400
It's a Kuma project.

525
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,700
It's all for me.

526
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,700
It's all for me.

527
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,500
I'm not even kidding.

528
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,400
Look at this.

529
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,900
Look at this.

530
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,900
No, seriously.

531
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,500
How did you let it get so successful?

532
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,300
What's going on?

533
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,700
I'm in the way of AC.

534
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,200
Hold on.

535
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,000
Hi.

536
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,500
I'm in the way of AC.

537
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,000
Look.

538
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,300
Look.

539
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,100
It's Kuma project and you let it get this successful.

540
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,700
Hello.

541
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,700
And now like, and then look, look, look, look, look, look broken.

542
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,300
Giant test.

543
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,400
Yandere officer Brad Farrell fucking.

544
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,700
And then this is unity and for some reason, look, I don't know if

545
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,500
you can see in the very top right left corner there.

546
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,300
That's the unity ammo and I was trying to stretch it to get bigger

547
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,500
and then I got really pixelated.

548
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,300
So there's just like pixel cuts of unity ammo everywhere.

549
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,400
I don't know what was going on.

550
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,600
I was like, I was trying my best.

551
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
I'm just like, I'm just having to be here.

552
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:08,700
Yeah.

553
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,700
A little tiny pot twist.

554
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,600
The rest of the girls is in the pro, the Kuma project.

555
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,100
We all got like a neck.

556
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,600
Okay.

557
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:17,700
Oh, wait.

558
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,500
No, I missed the sound effect.

559
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,300
I just think they're neat.

560
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,800
I just love my daughters.

561
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,900
I just think they're neat.

562
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,500
Okay.

563
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,400
So be nice to them.

564
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,100
I love them.

565
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,600
Okay.

566
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,900
Let me move over a little bit.

567
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,500
Okay.

568
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm getting smaller and smaller as time goes on.

569
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,400
I don't know how, but anyway.

570
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,300
Okay.

571
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:41,100
Why do I, why don't I use Scottish slang as much as a regular

572
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,600
Scott?

573
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,100
Okay.

574
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,300
You're actually American born in Canada and then this is an

575
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:45,900
Eagle.

576
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,400
That was really loud and your Pearson.

577
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,900
I'm going to lower the sound effects.

578
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,500
I'm sorry.

579
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,500
That was really loud.

580
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,100
This is an Eagle holding maple syrup.

581
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,300
I even drew his little legs on to my mom discouraged me from

582
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,400
using slang.

583
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:07,400
And one, I purposefully speak clear when I streamed you a

584
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,600
multiple factors.

585
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,100
And then this is a Brazilian news anchor and then I put my

586
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,000
face over them.

587
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,400
So yeah, that's that image.

588
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,600
And then this is my mom holding an orange sandal and then

589
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,900
this is my confession about my mom in the orange sandal.

590
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,600
That stupid fucking orange sandal she used to beat me with

591
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,000
and that fucking stung so badly and she'd always go for my

592
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,300
worst honest liquor fucking throw in the microwave the tuna

593
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,400
milk she was for doing that.

594
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,100
Thank God that stupid fucking sandal broke.

595
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,000
I hate sandals now.

596
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
God bless America.

597
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,400
When I become president, the sandals market is getting

598
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,300
nuked a fuck man.

599
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,400
I'll be signing that shit front and center when I get old into

600
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,000
the presidency or however the system works.

601
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,600
I don't know.

602
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The tuna melt.

603
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,600
She's a tuna melt for spanking me.

604
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,000
You ready?

605
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,000
Boom.

606
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,200
Oh my God.

607
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,800
Hold on.

608
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,200
This is like a gap.

609
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,900
Oh, no.

610
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,600
There's like, right.

611
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:04,800
Okay.

612
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,400
No, stop it.

613
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,300
Stop it.

614
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:08,800
Reflin.

615
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,400
I'm trying to move you darling.

616
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:10,600
Okay.

617
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,300
There we go.

618
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,400
Right.

619
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,600
Three points for my mom discouraged me zero because

620
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,800
you're a mop head up here and one point.

621
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,300
I actually do try and unseat my words better when I stream.

622
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,500
Basically, my mom still corrects my English when I text and

623
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:33,100
phone call her today and I denny geese off like the pyramids

624
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,400
the pyramid like the pyramid a geese off because I denny

625
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,300
geese off up.

626
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,000
Get it?

627
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,200
So yeah, my mom used to spank me when I use slang, which

628
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,100
is why I didn't I didn't he send that natural when I use

629
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,500
slang best because that's my mom.

630
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,300
That's my mom.

631
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,600
I'm all ruined it for all of us.

632
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:50,900
That's right.

633
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,000
Mom, I'm talking about you.

634
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,500
I'm trying to say about you mom.

635
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,300
That's you.

636
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,500
You've ruined my career.

637
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:56,600
No.

638
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:58,700
Right.

639
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,700
And then next.

640
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,400
Boom.

641
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,600
We're doing the intermission.

642
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,200
You know why?

643
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Because I got a cup of tea and I knew you feel well.

644
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
I was not.

645
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,700
Reflin.

646
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm trying to move you darling.

647
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,800
So make sure you're keeping a tally of your score your

648
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,300
entertainment source.

649
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,800
I don't know what I was supposed to do for the entertainment

650
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,100
source.

651
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,200
So allow me.

652
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Allow me for the entertainment source.

653
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:25,900
Okay, there you go.

654
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,100
Are you entertained?

655
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,000
You having a good time?

656
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,600
Yeah.

657
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,000
Yeah, you having a good time with the entertainment source?

658
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:34,800
Yeah.

659
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,600
Okay, just checking.

660
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
I need to hydrate.

661
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
So I'm doing a little.

662
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:40,600
Yeah.

663
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,900
Feeling thirsty for milk.

664
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,500
Oh, a little reefer.

665
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,400
I should have put my clothes back on.

666
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,100
Okay, there we go.

667
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,100
Thank you.

668
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,600
Okay.

669
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,200
Are you entertained?

670
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,300
Right?

671
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,100
I've got a cup of tea.

672
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,400
I'm going to I'm going to drink some of it.

673
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,900
Okay.

674
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,000
Hmm.

675
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,100
Ah, it's already room temperature.

676
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,600
Lovely.

677
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,400
Hmm.

678
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,000
I have a zero smoke though.

679
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,400
Wait, I've forgotten the number.

680
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,400
No, you're supposed to keep a tally.

681
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,500
I'll go back through.

682
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,400
I'll go back through to make sure.

683
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I need to keep a tally for you.

684
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,000
Are you not entertained?

685
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,100
But yeah.

686
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,300
Oh, wait, hold on a minute.

687
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,800
I have a sound effect for this.

688
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,100
Wait for it.

689
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,000
Oh, no, I missed the sound effect.

690
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Wait, go back.

691
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,200
Go back.

692
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,000
Go back.

693
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,400
I missed the sound effect.

694
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,800
That's my sound effect because I'm Scottish.

695
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,600
Oh, no, wait.

696
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,500
Okay, it was supposed to be that one.

697
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,300
Okay, right enough.

698
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,000
And then then when the pyramids show up, it's supposed to be this one.

699
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,200
Okay, you ready?

700
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
That curse of the Pharaoh shows up.

701
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,500
Hmm.

702
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,500
Literally, that was my sound effect.

703
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:04,900
Okay.

704
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,400
And then next, this one.

705
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,100
Because we're hydrating.

706
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,200
We need to stay hydrated.

707
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,700
Okay.

708
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,100
We're all hydrated.

709
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,800
We're all hydrated.

710
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
We're hydrating.

711
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,600
Wait, that's a Mario 64 thing?

712
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,900
Am I watching rehearsal of Emmy's brain roll stream?

713
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,100
Wait, isn't that bad?

714
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,300
I thought it was funny.

715
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,500
I want to drink your chug jug.

716
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,500
Fortnite battle pass.

717
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,400
Actually, I need a message to the music maker video person.

718
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,400
Who the fuck is Emmy's music video?

719
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,300
I just shit.

720
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,600
Okay, everyone's hydrated.

721
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,800
We're ready to go again.

722
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,300
Okay.

723
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,400
Point your refilling.

724
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,300
I have always wanted to meet a fruit bar.

725
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,100
And oh, and then get it.

726
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,100
It's got a flag and then it says ligma.

727
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,500
It says ligma.

728
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,300
So I've always wanted to meet a fruit bar.

729
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,300
I've always wanted to meet a raccoon because they're so cute and adorable.

730
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,300
Snuffy.

731
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,100
Snuffy, let me meet you.

732
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,800
Or I've always wanted to a giant gorilla.

733
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,200
Any guy just so poor.

734
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,500
But yeah, a giant gorilla.

735
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,000
Just like in those old video games.

736
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,000
Okay.

737
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,500
What animal have I always wanted to meet?

738
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,300
Okay.

739
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,600
That's right.

740
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,300
Use your brains.

741
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:36,700
Come on.

742
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,300
Think hard.

743
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:37,600
Don't worry.

744
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,000
You shouldn't actually do this.

745
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,000
Okay.

746
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,800
Okay.

747
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,400
Maybe.

748
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,200
I'm going with the raccoon because it's circled.

749
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,300
Boom.

750
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,700
I love gorillas.

751
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,300
Oh, I'm in the way of the gorilla facts.

752
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:54,600
Hold on.

753
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,400
Let me go in front.

754
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
So you get a point for a raccoon.

755
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,300
You get a point for a fruit back because I like the fruit.

756
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:00,800
Geez.

757
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,500
This this couldn't have gone anywhere.

758
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,900
So if I tried, you get a point for the back because I think bats are cute.

759
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,900
You get a point for the raccoon because I think raccoons are cute.

760
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,300
Why actually really like gorillas?

761
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,200
I've always wanted to feed a gorilla.

762
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,300
Um, I would think it would be nice.

763
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,700
You know how they have programs where you can feed them like through grates and

764
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,000
stuff and like see them interact and that I just think gorillas are really

765
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,500
neat.

766
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:25,900
Okay.

767
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,800
I just like them.

768
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,100
I think they're cute.

769
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,100
So you get a point for that.

770
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,000
I'd also like to say, I guess when I made this, I'd like to congratulate drugs on

771
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,700
the war on what I also like to congratulate drugs on winning the war on drugs.

772
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,900
Someone said that during my black ops one stream and it just popped into my head

773
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,300
right now.

774
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,400
I guess when I was making it, the deal.

775
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:45,700
Yeah.

776
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,100
Okay.

777
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:46,800
We get it.

778
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,200
We get it.

779
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,000
You were delirious.

780
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,400
That's enough of that.

781
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,800
Okay.

782
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:57,400
And then actually while I'm here, here's some facts about gorillas.

783
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,400
Where the fuck are the facts?

784
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

785
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,700
I just looked up on Google and I don't know what to copy and paste.

786
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,000
I just think they look so nice.

787
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,200
I want to see if I can visit those female ones.

788
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,700
Oh, that's literally what I just said.

789
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,200
Wow.

790
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,400
I'm, I predicted it.

791
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,400
Thingy, my bulber.

792
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:14,700
I don't know.

793
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,600
I'm getting really, okay.

794
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,000
As I said, I made this like when I was about to go to sleep.

795
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,700
So sorry.

796
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,300
I thought, I thought you were going to get a gorilla fact, but you're getting nothing.

797
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,700
You're getting nothing.

798
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,800
Fun fact.

799
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,400
Gorillas have two inch willies.

800
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,000
What?

801
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:31,900
Oh my God.

802
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,500
Oh, why is everything so scuffed in the stream?

803
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,500
Okay.

804
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,700
Why was that the one comment I read?

805
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,000
Okay.

806
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,700
Next.

807
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:55,900
Mummy wants your ink, your love, your money, your loyalty, your happiness, you.

808
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,500
Oh, this is like a picture of you.

809
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,900
Don't look at this.

810
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,700
I promise it's nothing bad.

811
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,800
And then I just want you to be you.

812
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,700
You are enough.

813
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,500
We flim.

814
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,300
And then I put, oh wait, does this make it really obvious what the answer is?

815
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,700
All of the above?

816
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,000
No, I don't want your worldly possession.

817
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,300
Let's get invested into my, my video game.

818
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:21,800
How about that?

819
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,000
All right.

820
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:29,200
And then so yeah, you get, oh no, wait, I didn't do this.

821
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:30,600
Okay.

822
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,900
I guess three points.

823
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:38,100
If you pick, I just want you to be you and you get a point for loyalty, love, happiness

824
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,100
and ink money.

825
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,300
You don't get a point for, cause that's not how it works.

826
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,700
It's not how it works.

827
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,000
Um, I don't want your money.

828
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,200
So streamer who built an empire, taking our money.

829
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,200
Ah, exchange of goods and services.

830
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,800
Not our money.

831
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,600
She hates those gifts.

832
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,500
Thank you, D-Man for the extended membership.

833
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,000
So you get a point for it.

834
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,100
Maybe actually, you know what?

835
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:07,000
You get two points for ink and then you get three points for being you and then one for

836
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
loyalty, one for love.

837
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,700
Two for happiness.

838
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:10,800
Yeah.

839
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
I want you to be happy.

840
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,400
Yeah.

841
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:19,300
I'll put you right on my head and then I think we're already done.

842
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
No way.

843
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,000
We're already done.

844
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,400
Hold on.

845
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,700
Oh, wait, let me know.

846
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,400
Hold on.

847
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,800
Let me open up my file.

848
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,100
I'm going to put you on my head.

849
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,600
Okay.

850
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,400
I'm gonna put you on my head for this stream for the rest of the stream.

851
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,000
Hi, wait man.

852
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,100
Can you go on my head please?

853
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:39,800
Why?

854
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,100
Yes.

855
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,600
Moment.

856
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,100
Yeah.

857
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,500
And you stay right there.

858
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:43,900
Okay.

859
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,400
Oh, yes.

860
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:45,700
Look.

861
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,000
Yeah.

862
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,800
Oh my God.

863
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,500
I love this.

864
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,200
This is the best technology ever.

865
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:52,800
Okay.

866
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,200
Now that you're on my head, we will keep you on my head for the rest of the stream.

867
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,200
Okay.

868
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,400
Please tally your numbers.

869
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,200
Oh, that's really drum rolling.

870
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,200
Hold on.

871
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,100
Wait, I wasn't ready.

872
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,700
I wasn't ready.

873
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,400
Please tally your numbers.

874
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,000
Oh God.

875
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,900
I'm like, I don't know where to put myself.

876
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,900
I'm so tiny.

877
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,600
Okay.

878
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,200
So I'm going to have to point with my head.

879
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:28,700
Okay.

880
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,900
So technically the maximum score is seven out of three.

881
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,800
But the game in one messed up a little bit.

882
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,900
So if you want to do the triple gaming thing.

883
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,500
Okay.

884
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:43,200
So if you're at number seven, you're in the red zone.

885
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:43,900
Okay.

886
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,100
Your correction training is needed right now.

887
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,800
Bend over.

888
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,300
Okay.

889
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,700
If you're in 14, you're not quite where I need you, but that's okay.

890
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,400
It's an excuse to spend more time together and then I've got grooms you harder.

891
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,800
I groom, groom, groom, groom, groom.

892
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,000
And then 24.

893
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:15,200
Now that you're clearly mind broken, I get to do whatever pops into my head.

894
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,600
Huh?

895
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,500
Huh?

896
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,400
And then look, it's you up.

897
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,100
And that's my face when I'm coming at you with my wee fangs.

898
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,800
And then that's it.

899
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,400
That's all prepared because I was totally raised to do anymore.

900
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,600
That's literally it.

901
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
I kid you not.

902
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,300
I, I have not had a good enough rest.

903
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,200
Yes.

904
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,700
Yeah, I don't even have a clap sound effect.

905
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,600
I can just play crowd disappointed because there wasn't too much.

906
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,200
Nope.

907
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,800
Oh, no, I've just crowd disappointed.

908
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,400
Isn't there?

909
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,200
Okay.

910
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,300
All my other sound effects are now broken for the new ones.

911
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,200
Okay.

912
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,100
I don't know how I've did that.

913
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,500
I've broken all my old sound effects, but my new ones are working fine.

914
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,000
Tee-hee.

915
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,000
Wait.

916
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,200
There are three times seven is 21.

917
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,400
Oh, it is.

918
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,600
How did I mess that up so badly?

919
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,200
I haven't.

920
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:13,900
Well.

921
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,100
Anyway.

922
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,300
What were your scores?

923
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,400
I was 21.

924
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,700
I don't know where the extra points came from.

925
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,300
I don't know.

926
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:28,900
I don't know.

927
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,400
What were you 19, 16, 11, 12?

928
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,000
Now remember, it's for fun.

929
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,300
There was a lot of questions.

930
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:40,500
You three, three as negative two.

931
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,600
That's not even possible.

932
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,500
Shocking.

933
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,600
There's a lot more grooming needed around these parts.

934
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,300
Clearly.

935
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,500
What's going on here?

936
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,500
You need correction immediately.

937
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,700
My internet was out zero real 15.

938
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,300
I just barely qualified for mind broken.

939
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:04,100
Without bonus points 18 with bonus 21, 62% passing grade 20.

940
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,600
I didn't know the last question had a bottomless opinion.

941
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,500
Oh, sorry.

942
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,400
Oh, it's an option.

943
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,200
I have no idea how to count the last slide because it went all of the above.

944
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,500
I don't know either.

945
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,700
As long as you had fun.

946
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,700
That's the main thing.

947
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,700
Um.

948
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,100
Testing on clear.

949
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,200
It seems I've become a crustacean.

950
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,700
A busty crustacean.

951
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,800
I'd say, but I'm pretty sure that's broken as well.

952
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,800
Yeah, but I'm screwed.

953
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,300
Can I model still?

954
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,700
Okay.

955
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,300
Right.

956
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,700
We just don't love me if I had pinpoint eyes.

957
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
My eyes are so tiny.

958
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,700
Oh my God.

959
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,300
I love this.

960
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:50,400
Oh, you know when someone takes their glasses off and their eyes are tiny?

961
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,100
Thank you, Nogen for becoming a member.

962
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,500
Thank you, Anonymous.

963
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,600
Our money isn't good enough.

964
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,700
Cry Anonymous.

965
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,600
Not like that.

966
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,000
Crack head eyes.

967
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,400
No.

968
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,600
I supposed to be like shock.

969
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,500
Oh my God.

970
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,800
I look like when someone takes their glicks off.

971
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,200
This looks awful.

972
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,300
Why is that amusing me?

973
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,700
Oh my God.

974
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,800
I can have beady lips.

975
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,600
Oh my God.

976
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,200
I can have beady little hypnosis eyes.

977
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,800
They're so tiny.

978
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:32,300
Imagine a hypnosis, a hypnotist being like looking to my eyes and her eyes are like fucking tiny.

979
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,800
Looking to my eyes and you're like, where?

980
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,000
I can't see them, bitch.

981
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,600
Looking to my eyes.

982
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,600
I want your car.

983
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,900
Oh my God.

984
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,900
Me discovering I have a moose after three months of streaming.

985
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,000
Why did you not let me break you in?

986
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,500
Hmm.

987
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:59,600
Anonymous, is it odd I got about half of the more personal questions on food and behavior, right?

988
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,200
Because my neuro-spacy spider senses gated my hand.

989
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,000
Clearly squids of a tentacle ink together.

990
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,800
Have a good one, Frank.

991
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,500
Thank you.

992
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,500
Oh, so I'm crying.

993
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,900
Thank you for getting the chicken question, right?

994
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,700
I love chicken.

995
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,000
Would you still love me if I was?

996
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,800
Yeah.

997
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,700
And we just don't give me it anyway.

998
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,400
Oh my God.

999
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,800
Wait, would you still give me your thingy if I had pinpoint eyes?

1000
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,000
P.V.

1001
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,700
Mummy, I just received my test results.

1002
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,100
I can't.

1003
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,200
It says I'm 10.

1004
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,300
Oh, I'm 10.

1005
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,100
102% refling with 2% margin error.

1006
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:38,800
Yeah.

1007
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,400
Yeah.

1008
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,900
You could.

1009
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,800
That's killing.

1010
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,400
When I said, what's this?

1011
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,800
Oh, why are you confused about refling?

1012
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,500
Huh, darling?

1013
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,700
What are you confused about?

1014
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,700
Are you confused about what happens next after stream to you?

1015
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,700
Don't need to be confused.

1016
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,500
You're still confused.

1017
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,800
Why are you confused, baby?

1018
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,000
What is this one?

1019
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,900
Oh, it's a sweat.

1020
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,800
I want to make you sweat.

1021
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,300
I don't have anything else.

1022
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,600
Anyways, that's me.

1023
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,100
And that sound was not a chair.

1024
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,000
Did my chair fart?

1025
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,100
I'm not getting blamed for farting if it was my chore.

1026
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,600
Right.

1027
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,100
Let's get this post in the frame.

1028
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,800
In no particular way.

1029
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,100
That's so tame.

1030
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,400
And he's that source.

1031
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:45,500
He can't receive the mummy brainwaves with the tin foil.

1032
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,800
No wonder he's confused.

1033
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
My puppy.

1034
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,500
Are we going to become calamari?

1035
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,800
I don't eat you.

1036
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,700
Not unless you want that one role play that I was going to do.

1037
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,300
Hey, you know that one role play?

1038
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,600
Yeah, I was going to do that.

1039
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,400
I got max points.

1040
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,700
Should we make out real and true?

1041
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,700
I'm going to read some marshmallow.

1042
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,300
I didn't.

1043
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,100
I didn't really have fast.

1044
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,300
I was going to blast through that to be honest.

1045
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,200
I was like, there's supposed to be a bit more content for today's stream.

1046
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,000
Which is a whipsie.

1047
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,500
My dad.

1048
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,900
And today's stream.

1049
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,900
Mummy for you.

1050
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,900
Would you like to?

1051
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,300
Can I put hold on?

1052
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,400
Are you ready to go for a swim?

1053
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,000
This is so cute.

1054
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,800
Okay.

1055
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
I'm not going to put you.

1056
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
I'll put you on my shoulder.

1057
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,400
How about that?

1058
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,300
Oh, now you look like a hair clip.

1059
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,800
No, you're not here.

1060
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,200
No, don't stop.

1061
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Stop zooming in on my googly-boogly.

1062
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,500
Okay.

1063
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,200
I'll put you on my shoulder.

1064
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:19,700
Okay.

1065
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,700
No, not my hair.

1066
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,400
The shoulder.

1067
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,300
Yeah.

1068
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,800
You stay on my shoulder, baby.

1069
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:26,900
Monk.

1070
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,400
Okay, then.

1071
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,700
Watched the John McGlatchelong last night.

1072
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,500
Thank you for giving me an excuse to rewatch them.

1073
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,000
Bruh, I was crying my eyes out like crazy in it.

1074
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,700
Thank you, crazy Jessie for the super chat.

1075
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,000
Reefling earrings?

1076
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,800
I don't know if I could fit you on my ears because I can hardly see them.

1077
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,800
But like now I got two reeflings.

1078
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,300
I think I have a third one.

1079
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,600
It's just you looking all shy.

1080
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,200
There you go.

1081
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,300
Yes, I have a folder of reeflings.

1082
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,500
No, I will not apologize for it.

1083
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,400
I think it's cute.

1084
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,500
Look at my little reeflings.

1085
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,800
They're all white, white.

1086
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
Ta-da!

1087
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,300
Reefling babies everywhere.

1088
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,300
I'm gonna rest inside your hair, Tufts.

1089
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,600
They would be quite thingy.

1090
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,300
Shoulders give us a good view like that and you'll look so cute on me.

1091
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,600
Do you have the inkling?

1092
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,600
I post the inkling a lot.

1093
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,300
I may be able to grab it from chat.

1094
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,800
How come mum lets you have two reeflings?

1095
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,300
Wait, let me see if I can grab the reefling ink one.

1096
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,800
Ah, I'm gonna have to go on YouTube together.

1097
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
Hold on.

1098
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,800
Oh my god.

1099
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800
Is that the strong e-cut?

1100
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,300
Oh, streaming lot.

1101
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,300
Um, actually yes.

1102
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,300
Yes?

1103
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,300
Question mark.

1104
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,300
I actually am streaming live and I'm mucking about with a reefling.

1105
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,800
But it doesn't get inkling.

1106
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,800
Any inkling?

1107
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,300
Is it gonna be tiny?

1108
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,800
My question is this gonna be tiny?

1109
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,300
Am I about to do SNH by accident?

1110
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,800
Where did that save to?

1111
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,800
I'm wondering why your mum didn't want you speaking Scottish slang.

1112
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,800
What's bad about it?

1113
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,800
My mum just wanted me to speak proper English.

1114
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,300
Like, not use slang.

1115
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,800
Like, she hates when I say like, oh, I did good in that.

1116
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,800
She always says, no, you did well.

1117
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,800
And I'm like, mum, oh my god, we're actually Scottish.

1118
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,800
Um, I do not know why she had such a stick-off or arse about it, honestly.

1119
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,300
Um, where did that image save?

1120
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,800
On to the desktop, right?

1121
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,800
So cast the fucking file over then.

1122
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,800
Where's my reefling?

1123
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,300
My wee inkling.

1124
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,800
Where are you?

1125
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
Where did you go?

1126
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,300
Oh, there you are.

1127
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,300
You're tiny though.

1128
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,800
Oh no, can I make you bigger?

1129
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,300
Oh, you're so pixelated.

1130
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,800
Oh no, where did I put you?

1131
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,300
Well, I put you in my hair like an accessory.

1132
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,800
Oh, you're so tiny and pixelated.

1133
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,800
Well, I'll do some SNH for you.

1134
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,300
My pixels.

1135
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,800
Right, I'll put you over there.

1136
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,800
Yeah, we've got the whole gang together.

1137
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,300
My little pixels.

1138
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,300
Not like this.

1139
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,300
I don't know why it came so tiny.

1140
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,800
My wee inkling.

1141
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,300
Yeah, but yes, thank you Grimby Vela for the super chat.

1142
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,300
Yeah, my mom just didn't want me speaking slang.

1143
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,800
Um, she just didn't like it.

1144
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,800
And I don't know why, because her parents...

1145
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,800
Actually, no, you know what?

1146
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,800
I know what I think about it.

1147
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,800
My grandparents didn't really speak much slang.

1148
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,800
Now that I think about it, hmm...

1149
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,300
So I think she just tried to instill it in me.

1150
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,800
You all got any more than pixels.

1151
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
Like, he's trying his best.

1152
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,800
Be nice to him.

1153
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,800
He's a good boy.

1154
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,300
He's a very good boy.

1155
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,300
Alright, let me refresh Marshimallow.

1156
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,300
What?

1157
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,300
Mommy, I knew I was going, but I didn't realize how far.

1158
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,300
I get hard during your streams.

1159
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,800
You what?

1160
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,300
How?

1161
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,800
I'm not doing anything.

1162
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,300
I'm just adding...

1163
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,300
What?

1164
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,300
Is it not normal?

1165
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,300
Wait a minute.

1166
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,800
Oh yeah, I put together like the most shit postie stream

1167
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,800
and you're like...

1168
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,800
Yeah, you like that?

1169
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,800
Is that what you want?

1170
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,300
He's already been conditioned.

1171
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,800
The accent and the voice.

1172
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,800
Okay, okay, I'll give you that.

1173
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,800
I like that.

1174
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,800
Hello, Strony.

1175
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,300
Hello, Ruflin.

1176
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,800
Wompam.

1177
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,800
Calamari.

1178
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,300
Thank you for being you.

1179
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,300
Yapadkwa.

1180
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,300
Also, I find it cute the way you've been saying baby.

1181
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,300
I love you.

1182
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,300
What's the matter, baby?

1183
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:49,300
Would you rather eat a baby goat or a matter baby?

1184
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,300
And then you go, matter baby.

1185
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,300
What's the matter, baby?

1186
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,300
I go, I don't know.

1187
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,300
What's the matter with you?

1188
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,300
Calcar, thank you for the extended membership.

1189
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,300
That Ruflin definitely scored a 24 somehow.

1190
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,300
It's your fault.

1191
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,300
That Ruflin's in the deep.

1192
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,300
He's rolling in the deep.

1193
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,300
My heart and soul.

1194
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,300
After the watching your ASMR,

1195
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,300
my brain too has been rewired to your voice.

1196
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,300
Strony's mind cannot comprehend that some Ruflin's come hard.

1197
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,300
Just based off of the emotional connection.

1198
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,300
Oh, that's so cute though.

1199
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,300
What the fuck?

1200
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,300
Me?

1201
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,300
I bet you, you know what?

1202
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,300
Emotional connection will be severed after overwatch too.

1203
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,300
I'm going to start ordering you around those maps,

1204
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,300
even though I've not even played the new ones or anything.

1205
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,300
I'll be like, ah, Denny Ken, what are you friends on?

1206
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:47,300
Fucking go to Anna and Nanome right now.

1207
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:52,300
You're literally the bond will be severed during overwatch.

1208
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,300
I can already tell now.

1209
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,300
Momay, I got 17 out of 21.

1210
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,300
Does that mean I'm in the yellow or the green?

1211
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,300
Because if I'm in the green,

1212
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,300
I promise to watch even more of your VODs.

1213
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,300
Stream sub, if I'm fully yours.

1214
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,300
Baby, you don't have to do that.

1215
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,300
You are doing well enough.

1216
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,300
What's going on here?

1217
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,300
Oh, I've seen that one.

1218
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,300
Whatever happened to the audio of you and me being sisters,

1219
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,300
I never got finished.

1220
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:27,300
I never finished the one-on-one scripts that I was going to make with the girls.

1221
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,300
Mummy does only reeflings, so don't push the payload.

1222
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:36,300
I think maybe at the end of my 100 VTuber ASMR collab challenge,

1223
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:41,300
I think it would be nice if the last five were the girls,

1224
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,300
so it would be near the end of the year.

1225
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,300
I'm going to try and finish my little thing by the end of the year.

1226
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,300
I think that would be quite nice.

1227
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,300
I think I became addicted after the pregnancy ASMR audio.

1228
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,300
I think we're doing bath time where I get you all nice and clean,

1229
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,300
ready for bed, which I think is really cute.

1230
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,300
Get to that point, you're my best.

1231
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,300
You love being a tank, yes, I'll be your personal mercy.

1232
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,300
Oh yes, my little little reefling.

1233
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,300
But yes, I think it would be very nice and poetic.

1234
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,300
Poetic? No, that's not the word.

1235
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:24,300
I would just be nice if the end of my little goal was my gen mates, one-on-one,

1236
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:28,300
and then that would be my 100 VTuber collabs,

1237
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,300
because I'm about to get back on it like a car bonnet, yes.

1238
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,300
Hi, Stronny, hi, reefling.

1239
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,300
The Forget Your Name ASMR really affected me, and I wasn't expecting it.

1240
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:42,300
I haven't really experienced hypnosis, and I don't know what it's supposed to feel like,

1241
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,300
but for a while after the stream, there was a mental block

1242
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:49,300
that stopped me from thinking of my name as anything other than reefling.

1243
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:53,300
I am your Stronny and body-mind and soul-loving Stronny.

1244
00:46:54,300 --> 00:47:00,300
I'm nervous about the next hypnosis stream.

1245
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:05,300
I'm not going to do ASMR for the next hypnosis stream.

1246
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:09,300
I'm just going to talk into the SMB with the echo effect,

1247
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:14,300
and I'm nervous about it, but I'm going to get a clicker as well and see how it goes.

1248
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,300
I need to do my research for the next hypnosis stream.

1249
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:22,300
Don't expect it to go super quickly, okay?

1250
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,300
Get on the fucking payload, you stupid monkey, you big fat dick.

1251
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:33,300
Literally, look, I get raging if we can win and we're not winning,

1252
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,300
but yee, I already have a clicker.

1253
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:44,300
I want to get one, and then the next hypnosis live stream is going to be through the SMB.

1254
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,300
It's not going to be through the 3DO.

1255
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,300
Apparently my reverb was really too harsh as well.

1256
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,300
Well, I don't remember changing the sentence though,

1257
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:58,300
so I don't know if it kind of did a reset because it's plugins that I use for that kind of thing.

1258
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,300
Say, Stroners, what was your peak over what shrank?

1259
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,300
The one above Platinum?

1260
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,300
I've forgotten the name.

1261
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,300
Diamond?

1262
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,300
Diamond.

1263
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:14,300
My brain felt really numb and it felt good after yesterday's hypnosis stream.

1264
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,300
Ah, you like that?

1265
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,300
I always get so worried. Diamond?

1266
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,300
Yeah, diamond.

1267
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,300
I really like the hypnosis, but could you dial back a little bit on the echo effect?

1268
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,300
Yeah, I got that in my marshmallow and I was like, oopsies.

1269
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:34,300
I don't know if maybe the plugin reset and it was a bit too harsh.

1270
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,300
Maybe a bit too harsh?

1271
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,300
I don't know.

1272
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:44,300
And the same peak rank.

1273
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,300
Mummy, you're going to have to carry us.

1274
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,300
Why are you guys gold?

1275
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,300
Be honest.

1276
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:53,300
I started out silver and I made it to Diamond, so I'm proud of myself,

1277
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,300
but I've not played Overwatch 2 so silver.

1278
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:59,300
Oh my God, Kolker, thank you for the extended membership.

1279
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,300
Did I even say thank you?

1280
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,300
Thank you, Kolker, everybody.

1281
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:08,300
That refling was scored at 24.

1282
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,300
I think I said the message now.

1283
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,300
The echo effect made it better?

1284
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,300
I'm wondering if the echo effect on SMB only would be good.

1285
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:21,300
As I said, any live stream of the scripts will be made into videos,

1286
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,300
so like, I won't fuck it up as much.

1287
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,300
How did she guess I would hard stock gold?

1288
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,300
Just call Moira, suck the fucking soul out of them.

1289
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,300
Fetch me their souls!

1290
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,300
Basically it's what you need to do.

1291
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,300
Just play Moira and go for it.

1292
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,300
Oh wait, I actually have...

1293
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,300
No, I don't know where the balances are anymore,

1294
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,300
so don't listen to me, okay?

1295
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,300
Hypnosis doesn't really work on me from the little I tried,

1296
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,300
but the hypnosis was still relaxing.

1297
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,300
It's nothing more.

1298
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,300
Hi, Strony, I got fill points.

1299
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,300
Does that mean you owe me?

1300
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,300
You owe me now, if so, I'm happy with this.

1301
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,300
I'm going to walk you like a dog.

1302
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,300
I see what's going on.

1303
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:14,300
I think I'm trying, baby.

1304
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,300
Why?

1305
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,300
Are my chiefsters streaming?

1306
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:25,300
I'm going to be directing to our Suntium.

1307
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,300
Don't be a very...

1308
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,300
What did I have planned?

1309
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,300
I had something else planned.

1310
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,300
What did I have planned today?

1311
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,300
Now hold on a minute, what did I have planned?

1312
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,300
Oh, a movie, watch along.

1313
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,300
Those are my favorites.

1314
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,300
I'm going to wade the rabbit later.

1315
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,300
I'm going to read some more Mushy Mallows

1316
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,300
and then we're going to wade the rabbit.

1317
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,300
I do apologize for how tiny the stream was.

1318
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,300
I'm literally SPH shaming the stream.

1319
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:54,300
I did not expect it to be so short, genuinely.

1320
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,300
I was very delirious putting this together,

1321
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,300
but I like blasted through it.

1322
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,300
It was a very...

1323
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:06,300
How about we just agree to call it an experimental stream?

1324
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,300
Sorry, my brain was literally mashing together

1325
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,300
all of those vowels at once.

1326
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:14,300
How about we agree to call it an experimental stream

1327
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:18,300
that when Ori, it went Ori,

1328
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,300
which is probably when we go back to it,

1329
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,300
but it was Ori.

1330
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:27,300
The next education stream is going to be about drugs.

1331
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,300
I'm going to teach you about drugs.

1332
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,300
Like cocaine now.

1333
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,300
Heroin.

1334
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,300
Drugs.

1335
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,300
And I'm qualified to talk about it

1336
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,300
and you want to know why?

1337
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,300
Because Scotland is the overdose capital of Europe.

1338
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,300
Round of applause.

1339
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,300
Hold on, hold on.

1340
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,300
Let me get it up, let me get it up.

1341
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,300
Round of applause Scotland for

1342
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:54,300
overdose city.

1343
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,300
When will we see...

1344
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:59,300
Oh, congrats, congrats Scotland.

1345
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,300
Oh, overdose city.

1346
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,300
It's not a good thing.

1347
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,300
No, it's not, but at least I can say it.

1348
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,300
I would say Hypnosis doesn't work on me,

1349
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,300
but it's thinking about you for the rest of the day.

1350
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,300
I'll let you consult Ori.

1351
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,300
I want to do...

1352
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,300
My next one isn't as pleasant.

1353
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,300
Well, it's a lot more diabolical,

1354
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,300
my next hypnosis stream.

1355
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,300
It may or may not be pet play

1356
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,300
in turning you into a puppy.

1357
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,300
I'm sorry.

1358
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,300
If only I wanted to do it.

1359
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,300
I'm going to get a clicker and I'm going to get a color

1360
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,300
and a leash and a dog bowl.

1361
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,300
And it's going to be fucked up.

1362
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:42,300
But I'm doing it.

1363
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,300
And nothing can stop me.

1364
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,300
This stream corresponds with your hate,

1365
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,300
so it fits.

1366
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,300
You call me under that shirt?

1367
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,300
I'm 100...

1368
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,300
What am I in American units?

1369
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,300
Because you're all American.

1370
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,300
In American units?

1371
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,300
Oh my God, is that even a sentence?

1372
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:08,300
I taped in 162 centimeters in American units

1373
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:11,300
and I'm apparently 1.7 yard.

1374
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,300
And what do you use?

1375
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,300
Feet? You use feet.

1376
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,300
I'm 5 foot 3.

1377
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,300
I'm just over 5 foot 3.

1378
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,300
I'm literally 5 foot 3.1.

1379
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,300
Feet?

1380
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,300
162 centimeters.

1381
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,300
No, 162.

1382
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,300
Short?

1383
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,300
How tall are you then?

1384
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,300
You fan dance.

1385
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,300
How tall are you? 5'11?

1386
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,300
5'3 short now?

1387
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,300
I don't know.

1388
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,300
162 short?

1389
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,300
The point zero is really important.

1390
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,300
That fuck is 162!

1391
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,300
What are they feeding you in your country?

1392
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,300
Jesus!

1393
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,300
Go back down.

1394
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,300
5'10? 5'11? 5'7?

1395
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:03,300
175? 5'11?

1396
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,300
6'3!

1397
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,300
Fuckin' sit down, man.

1398
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,300
Save some height for the rest of us.

1399
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,300
What the fuck?

1400
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,300
Bloody clunge magnet over here identified.

1401
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,300
I'm so sorry if you don't know what that means.

1402
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,300
To the two British people that are laughing their heads off at that time.

1403
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,300
Love you.

1404
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,300
What the fuck?

1405
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,300
Why are you all so tall?

1406
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,300
What did you eat?

1407
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:29,300
I used to eat my carrots as a child.

1408
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,300
That was funny.

1409
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,300
What the fuck is a clunge?

1410
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,300
What the fuck is a clunge?

1411
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:08,300
Guys, I fucked up.

1412
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,300
Wraith blend.

1413
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,300
I made a oopsie-oopsie.

1414
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,300
I need to come in really close to tell you the secret, okay?

1415
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:20,300
I took the picture of me with the soup.

1416
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,300
But I got cold feet, okay?

1417
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,300
But the reason I got cold feet is...

1418
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,300
I did blur everything.

1419
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:31,300
But you know how I have...

1420
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,300
I have small assets.

1421
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:37,300
I have small personalities.

1422
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,300
If you didn't know,

1423
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,300
when you have small personalities,

1424
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:47,300
your nip-noops don't point straight forward.

1425
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,300
I have feeding nip-noops,

1426
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,300
and I got really embarrassed,

1427
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:56,300
and I don't know if I have the strength to put the picture online.

1428
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,300
I'm scared.

1429
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:01,300
I don't know, people will make fun of my nip-noops.

1430
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:06,300
I got the milk drinking cane,

1431
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:11,300
which means that they aren't pointing straight at you like eyeballs.

1432
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:17,300
So I don't know if I have the balls to post that right now.

1433
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,300
I'll keep looking at it, but...

1434
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:23,300
I'm not sure.

1435
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:27,300
We so only swear we won't make fun of the nip-noops.

1436
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,300
Um...

1437
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,300
I demand soup and milk right now.

1438
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,300
Don't care, still inking.

1439
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:39,300
Cross-eyed? No, they don't go inwards.

1440
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:42,300
If you have booby feeding...

1441
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:45,300
So in order to feed the child, it should technically go...

1442
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:48,300
like, slightly upwards like this.

1443
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:52,300
Free the titty as much as I can fit.

1444
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,300
Cross-eyed boobies? No, they're no cockeyed tits.

1445
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,300
I don't got cockeyed tits, the other way, the other way.

1446
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,300
But like, because of the way I was holding the plate,

1447
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:04,300
I pushed them, like, I had a bowl of my soup.

1448
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:08,300
I like, pushed them together, and they look funny.

1449
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,300
You're pregnant? No!

1450
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:14,300
No, I'm not getting... No!

1451
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,300
Only Magento.

1452
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,300
I'm not getting pregnant, mom.

1453
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:23,300
Didn't you not know what happens to your color of your pasties

1454
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,300
if you get pregnant?

1455
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:28,300
Inverted!

1456
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,300
I just cropped them out, put googly eyes on them.

1457
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,300
That'd be interesting.

1458
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,300
Anonymous, thank you for the tip.

1459
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:38,300
I've heard it says that Edinburgh is the culture capital of Scotland

1460
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,300
because of the great culture of friendly people.

1461
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:43,300
In classical Alharka texture,

1462
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:48,300
all of which are great to see when not buying heroin!

1463
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:52,300
I'm looking forward to the just say no stream.

1464
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:55,300
No stream? Yeah, you want the drug screen?

1465
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,300
No, I'm getting a drug screen.

1466
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,300
Put whipped cream on them?

1467
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,300
You're nursing? Yeah, the reeflings.

1468
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,300
That's about it.

1469
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,300
We love you in every shape and form.

1470
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:08,300
Yeah, even if my boobies don't point straight far away,

1471
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,300
because I got Westies and boobies.

1472
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:14,300
Yeah, there's different types of boobies in the world.

1473
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:18,300
I got the kind that I fall for.

1474
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,300
Good, good moment for sure.

1475
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:24,300
I'll take a look at it again, okay?

1476
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,300
And then I might get the balls to post it.

1477
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:31,300
But don't be surprised if I never post another thing like that again.

1478
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,300
And...

1479
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:39,300
Oh boobah, boobah, boobah.

1480
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,300
And...

1481
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,300
You don't have to read this on stream or anything.

1482
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:47,300
But what if I do? What happens if I do?

1483
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,300
I've been on the road again?

1484
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,300
Oh, no, you're...

1485
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:54,300
I've been on the road to recovering from alcoholism.

1486
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,300
And I'm six months sober!

1487
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,300
Let's go!

1488
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,300
Render for pause reeflings!

1489
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,300
Six months sober, I.A.

1490
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,300
Let's go! That's amazing!

1491
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:08,300
It's been a lot of trial and error with therapy and medicine

1492
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,300
to get my brain in a good place.

1493
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,300
Exactly!

1494
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,300
When I found out about you and other girls, it was perfect timing

1495
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,300
because I was struggling.

1496
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,300
Getting to listen to interact with you has been a lot of fun.

1497
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,300
I feel like I get to hang out on stream almost every day.

1498
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:23,300
Thank you for everything you do for us reeflings and girdleys.

1499
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,300
You truly are wonderful person.

1500
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,300
Let's go reeflings!

1501
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,300
Six months sobriety is so big.

1502
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:33,300
Did you know you no longer have any of the physiological addictions

1503
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,300
in your body now?

1504
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:38,300
It's all just in your head.

1505
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,300
And I know you can defeat the demons.

1506
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,300
You know that.

1507
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,300
You know that.

1508
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:48,300
Keep bad.

1509
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,300
Keep bad.

1510
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:56,300
It's not easy, but as I said, your body no longer needs it.

1511
00:59:56,300 --> 01:00:00,300
So it's all psychological next and if you're getting the help you need,

1512
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:02,300
you defeated the demons.

1513
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,300
Isn't that about how long you've been streaming?

1514
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,300
Six months?

1515
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,300
Fucking hell!

1516
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:09,300
I've not even reached the three month mark yet!

1517
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,300
It's not even been the three months yet.

1518
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:16,300
It will be three months on the first of September.

1519
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,300
A coincidence?

1520
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,300
I think not.

1521
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,300
Eh.

1522
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,300
Hee hee hee.

1523
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,300
Eh.

1524
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:30,300
I repeat myself, but don't post if you're not comfortable.

1525
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,300
I'll take a look at it again and see what I think.

1526
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:36,300
I just, I edit a bit and I was like...

1527
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:41,300
You know, I was kind of just like...

1528
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:45,300
I'm not sure because I don't really do that.

1529
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,300
And...

1530
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,300
Me.

1531
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,300
I thought it was four months.

1532
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:54,300
No, we started June, so...

1533
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:57,300
June 1st, July 1st, August...

1534
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:00,300
Wait, am I an idiot?

1535
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:05,300
Yeah, by the end of August will be three full months of streaming.

1536
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,300
So the fourth month will start in September,

1537
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,300
but that's not four months of streaming.

1538
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,300
That's how maths works, right?

1539
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,300
Surely that's how maths works.

1540
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,300
Yes.

1541
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,300
So I'm about to hit my three months.

1542
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:23,300
First of December is the start of the f-

1543
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,300
I'm gonna burp.

1544
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:25,300
Eh.

1545
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,300
Eh.

1546
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,300
I'm gonna burp, burp, burp, burp.

1547
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,300
No, no, no, no.

1548
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:34,300
Do not worry, there will still be the refund on your hair pixelated.

1549
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:37,300
He's only stuck by the ink, honestly.

1550
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:39,300
I need to pee, actually.

1551
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,300
Refling, can you help me?

1552
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,300
I need to pee.

1553
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,300
Stop, I'm gonna turn you into the...

1554
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,300
I'm gonna make you accidentally enjoy that kink.

1555
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,300
Stop!

1556
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,300
Stop!

1557
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,300
I was joking.

1558
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,300
No, I'm joking.

1559
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:59,300
I'm joking, because I'm gonna accidentally give you the...

1560
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,300
E.

1561
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:05,300
I'll whip some of it immediately so I can play with your small test.

1562
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:06,300
Stop.

1563
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,300
Grip them so much, I'll have to get my hands surgically removed.

1564
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,300
Oh my god.

1565
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,300
Eh.

1566
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:20,300
On stream right now, you have a minor popping noise in the left ear coming through.

1567
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,300
It's really faint and intermittent.

1568
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,300
At least, Kate, wait, right now?

1569
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,300
Eh, pop now?

1570
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,300
Better not be fucking popping.

1571
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,300
Do you know how much I paid for you, SMB7?

1572
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:36,300
A whole hundred and something dollars.

1573
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:38,300
Better not be a pop noise.

1574
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,300
I was on the 3D.

1575
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,300
Oh my gosh, my stream being popping now?

1576
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,300
Is it still popping?

1577
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:49,300
I can't hear it.

1578
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:55,300
The first exposure to existence was Hold It While You Pee.

1579
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,300
Well, I hope you're ready for the...

1580
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:59,300
The sequel.

1581
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,300
Let me stack donuts on it.

1582
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,300
Please, let me stack donuts on it.

1583
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,300
What's the point?

1584
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,300
Please.

1585
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,300
I'll even fluff you.

1586
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,300
Please, let me stack donuts on it.

1587
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,300
I went to Krispy Kreme.

1588
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,300
Look, I got ice...

1589
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,300
Ice...

1590
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,300
Is it icing?

1591
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,300
I don't eat donuts.

1592
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:21,300
Is it icing flavored donuts where it's got like the thingy?

1593
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,300
Please.

1594
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,300
Please.

1595
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,300
It's cracked again.

1596
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,300
Shut the fuck up.

1597
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,300
See, I fucking bam.

1598
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,300
Let's start smacking this shit with this mic.

1599
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,300
I don't know.

1600
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,300
Is it because I'm peeking at myself?

1601
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,300
Oh!

1602
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,300
Did it peek when I did that? Be honest.

1603
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,300
Did it peek when I sung...

1604
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,300
Maybe five donuts?

1605
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,300
Speaking of a glee donut?

1606
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:53,300
No, it seems random.

1607
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,300
Is my cable dying?

1608
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,300
Do you get fucking done

1609
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,300
if you crack something like your crackly bastard, you?

1610
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,300
You're the fuckest crackling.

1611
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:03,300
Is it you?

1612
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,300
It's my headset.

1613
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,300
It's my headset.

1614
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,300
It's my headset that was crackling back at you.

1615
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:14,300
I think.

1616
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:15,300
I think it's my headset.

1617
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:17,300
You don't hear it anymore, do you?

1618
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:19,300
I think it's my head.

1619
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:21,300
Not the headset.

1620
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,300
Call me a baker,

1621
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:26,300
because I'm going to glaze that hole.

1622
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:28,300
Yeah, it was my headset

1623
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,300
looking back into you.

1624
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,300
Sorry.

1625
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,300
I have voice jammer on.

1626
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,300
Sorry.

1627
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,300
I'm sorry.

1628
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:39,300
I think it's my head.

1629
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,300
Turn me into a twinkie.

1630
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:41,300
No!

1631
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,300
Here are my results.

1632
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:45,300
Your results of what?

1633
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,300
When you send a cat box link

1634
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,300
and it's like really...

1635
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,300
There's no other...

1636
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:54,300
Oh, your results are the fucking thing.

1637
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,300
That's so good.

1638
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,300
Someone...

1639
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,300
Oh, he goes,

1640
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:00,300
ooh, ah, ah, the gorilla?

1641
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:01,300
No, no.

1642
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,300
He just stayed behind for correction.

1643
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,300
Real and true, though.

1644
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,300
Hey, Johnny.

1645
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,300
How are we doing?

1646
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,300
Before I found Villalour,

1647
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,300
I was struggling with grief and loss

1648
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,300
of someone special to me.

1649
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:22,300
I'm sorry to hear about that.

1650
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:25,300
About a special as a Oshie is to a fan.

1651
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:26,300
I was in a dark space in my life

1652
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,300
and struggling

1653
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,300
ever since I found more laughs

1654
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:31,300
than I could have expected

1655
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,300
and more rest will sleep

1656
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:33,300
than much before.

1657
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,300
Please tell Emy, Icy,

1658
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,300
Azura, Shibi, and Mercy

1659
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:36,300
that they have no idea

1660
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,300
about the life they saved

1661
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,300
in their debuts.

1662
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,300
Aww, that's so precious.

1663
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:42,300
Thank you, little whistling.

1664
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:45,300
I don't think it would matter

1665
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:46,300
how your body looks

1666
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,300
if that's how you look,

1667
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:48,300
then that's how you look.

1668
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,300
No shame about it

1669
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,300
if you stay true to yourself.

1670
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:52,300
I'm just gonna artificially

1671
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,300
photoshop my nips.

1672
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:58,300
I mean, it's blurred.

1673
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,300
Typical nation.

1674
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,300
Thank you for your super chat

1675
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:02,300
and your sharing.

1676
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:04,300
And you'll have someone

1677
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:07,300
especially a little trust.

1678
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,300
No, I'm not allowed

1679
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,300
to photoshop my nips.

1680
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,300
It's not like they're too big

1681
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:13,300
or anything.

1682
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:14,300
It's just got,

1683
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,300
I just got booby feeding nips

1684
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:17,300
and it's like, why?

1685
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:19,300
I don't plan.

1686
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,300
The only thing that's

1687
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,300
allowed to hang off my boob

1688
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:22,300
is a wifelin, okay?

1689
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,300
I shit with a shit.

1690
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,300
I shit with a shit.

1691
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:27,300
On your wifelin.

1692
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,300
I love to do that.

1693
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:33,300
You didn't have to cut me off.

1694
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:35,300
Give us to him straight.

1695
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,300
Right, I'll analize the picture

1696
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,300
a bit more after the stream.

1697
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,300
How about that?

1698
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,300
Also, both my Patreon audios

1699
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,300
are gonna be uploaded today.

1700
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,300
They're all ready.

1701
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,300
One of them is so keep this rule play.

1702
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:48,300
I can't remember

1703
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:51,300
if I did a source boy.

1704
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:01,300
Hold on.

1705
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:04,300
Hold on.

1706
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,300
Access denied.

1707
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,300
Uh...

1708
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,300
Ah, the fricking

1709
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:16,300
closed the file off.

1710
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:18,300
They need to body share it.

1711
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,300
That was me.

1712
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,300
That was my PC if you heard that.

1713
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,300
Although I've muted the desktops,

1714
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,300
I don't think you heard that at all.

1715
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:26,300
You didn't have to cut me off.

1716
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,300
Speaking about Patreon now,

1717
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:28,300
keep returning to the recent

1718
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,300
Kiss and One.

1719
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:30,300
I don't think it's allowed.

1720
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,300
I think it has to be wrote it together.

1721
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,300
I'm ready to write the one for October.

1722
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,300
No, September next.

1723
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:37,300
Because there's a missing one in September.

1724
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:38,300
September.

1725
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:40,300
And then we get to write it again.

1726
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,300
I think I'm in too deep.

1727
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,300
I'm on vacation.

1728
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:49,300
Happy vacation!

1729
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,300
Are you in the sunny place?

1730
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,300
I know I can think about

1731
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:53,300
the streams I'm gonna miss.

1732
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:54,300
I'm gonna try and have fun,

1733
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,300
but it's really hard.

1734
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,300
Have I been grimmed?

1735
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:57,300
Slightly.

1736
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,300
I have fun on vacation though.

1737
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,300
The vacation!

1738
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,300
Vacation.

1739
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:04,300
On holiday.

1740
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:05,300
We go.

1741
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:06,300
Yes, yes.

1742
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,300
Like, sorry, that was my...

1743
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,300
I did not fart!

1744
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:10,300
I did not fart

1745
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,300
if that came up in the microphone, okay?

1746
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:13,300
I did not fart.

1747
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:14,300
I did not fart.

1748
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,300
Leave me alone.

1749
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,300
I didn't fart.

1750
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:19,300
If you're on holiday,

1751
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,300
you should enjoy it.

1752
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:21,300
Like, my content's always gonna be there.

1753
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:22,300
And I know the VODs

1754
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:24,300
aren't exactly the same.

1755
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,300
But there isn't that exciting stuff this week.

1756
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:28,300
I would say this week,

1757
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:29,300
like, in terms...

1758
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,300
Oh, hold on.

1759
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:31,300
Something's moving.

1760
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,300
Who?

1761
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:33,300
Oh, the background.

1762
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,300
Something was moving.

1763
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,300
Where's me?

1764
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:41,300
I would say, maybe...

1765
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:43,300
They kill it with fire, with djinn.

1766
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:44,300
I'm flew, yo.

1767
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:45,300
It's gonna be...

1768
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,300
She must get that all the time.

1769
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:48,300
I'm so sorry.

1770
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:49,300
I'm gonna have to apologize to her

1771
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:50,300
in the voice chat.

1772
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,300
That'll be interesting

1773
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:58,300
because I'm not playing kill it with fire, too.

1774
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,300
We're gonna play...

1775
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:01,300
Mummy, are we supposed to have

1776
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,300
the background music on?

1777
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,300
Do you want it on?

1778
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:06,300
Or do you just want me?

1779
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:09,300
I don't have my background music set up.

1780
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,300
Hold on.

1781
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:11,300
You're getting YouTube instead.

1782
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:13,300
You're getting YouTube music instead.

1784

1785
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:19,300
Legend of Zelda Lo-Fi.

1786
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:21,300
Strony, why do you always put that on?

1787
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,300
I don't know.

1788
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,300
It's just really nice and relaxing, okay?

1789
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:25,300
Oh, sorry.

1790
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:26,300
It sped up.

1791
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,300
Sorry, it was sped up.

1792
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:28,300
Hold on.

1793
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,300
Let's slow down there with a harp.

1794
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:31,300
Oh, wait.

1795
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,300
No, my headset is broken.

1796
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:35,300
I can't let you listen to desktop audio.

1797
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:39,300
Oh, shit.

1798
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:42,300
Right, hold on a minute.

1799
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,300
Hold on.

1800
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,300
Wait, I just realized the schedule's on my face.

1801
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,300
Hold on a minute.

1802
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,300
Okay, I'm gonna go to my loading screen

1803
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:53,300
in order to grab my background music, okay?

1804
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,300
Don't panic.

1805
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,300
Don't panic.

1806
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,300
I said don't panic.

1807
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,300
I'm still here.

1808
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:02,300
I just need to grab my background theme from here, okay?

1809
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,300
Stop panicking.

1810
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:04,300
I'm still here.

1811
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,300
Okay, there we go.

1812
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,300
Boom.

1813
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,300
Just like that.

1814
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:08,300
I never left.

1815
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:09,300
I'm just like that.

1816
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,300
I never left.

1817
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:11,300
Paste.

1818
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,300
Rename.

1819
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,300
No, paste.

1820
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:14,300
Paste.

1821
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,300
Right.

1822
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:17,300
Oh, my God.

1823
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,300
Did you hear it?

1824
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:21,300
No, I didn't know.

1825
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,300
I'm in here.

1826
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:23,300
Did you hear it?

1827
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:25,300
You can still hear it.

1828
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,300
What, the popping?

1829
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,300
The body, oh, no.

1830
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:35,300
I did not hit replaying.

1831
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,300
I did not.

1832
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,300
Oh, hi, replay.

1833
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,300
Oh, she back.

1834
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:42,300
No, the popping is gone.

1835
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:43,300
No, that's fine.

1836
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:44,300
Okay, it better be.

1837
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:47,300
The only thing that should be remaining is

1838
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:49,300
the hit popping, cooking stream.

1839
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:50,300
That was terrible.

1840
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,300
That's fine.

1841
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:52,300
I can hear faint music.

1842
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:53,300
Is it too faint?

1843
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,300
Get that bad boy up.

1844
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:06,300
Oh, my secret project might have an update.

1845
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,300
Hold on.

1846
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:09,300
Hold on.

1847
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,300
Okay.

1848
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,300
My secret project has an update.

1849
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:16,300
Honestly, I can't tell you about it.

1850
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:18,300
You're going to be a good little weakling.

1851
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:22,300
You're going to wait and you're going to have so much

1852
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:23,300
patience.

1853
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:30,300
We're the fun we're going to have together.

1854
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:34,300
And then when I can finally leak it, it's

1855
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:36,300
fucking over for you.

1856
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:43,300
Going to leak on your face, down your chest,

1857
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:52,300
your snail trail, right on top of your tentacle.

1858
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:54,300
But not yet.

1859
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:55,300
No secret leaking yet.

1860
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,300
No secret leaking time.

1861
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:01,300
I'll be patient.

1862
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:03,300
Yeah, you can wait.

1863
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,300
I'll leak all of them in.

1864
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:08,300
Wait, but very excited.

1865
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:09,300
We love the full package.

1866
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:11,300
You silly woman.

1867
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,300
We don't pick and choose what bits you have.

1868
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:15,300
This isn't build a bear.

1869
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:18,300
Do you think I can get a build a bear of icicle?

1870
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,300
When I say I love you, I mean, I love you.

1871
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:22,300
I wouldn't have gone through that if I didn't love you.

1872
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,300
If you think your nip nips are going to stop us from loving you.

1873
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:26,300
Okay, I don't like the full.

1874
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,300
I don't like the full.

1875
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,300
I won't be.

1876
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,300
Because I'm completely blurred.

1877
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:30,300
You can't see anything.

1878
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:33,300
And literally the meme is like, here's my chicken soup.

1879
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,300
And the worst part about the chicken soup is it

1880
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:37,300
fricking congealed.

1881
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:39,300
So it doesn't look like soup in the picture.

1882
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:42,300
It looks like medieval slop, which makes the picture

1883
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:43,300
10 times worse.

1884
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:46,300
Everyone's not even going to care about the background.

1885
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:48,300
Everyone's going to be like, what is that medieval slop

1886
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,300
in your bowl?

1887
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:51,300
And it's cause my soup congealed.

1888
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:54,300
I should have taken the picture the day before,

1889
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:57,300
but I'm going to say something even worse because it congealed.

1890
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:00,300
I could like tilt the plate towards the camera.

1891
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:04,300
Like add it in a bowl and I tilted it.

1892
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,300
I could like tilt it towards the camera and I took

1893
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,300
like a couple of different photos.

1894
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:11,300
So I had to add water.

1895
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:14,300
So like I take the photos and then I added water and

1896
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:16,300
microwaved it and it got a bit more soupy.

1897
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:19,300
That means more collagen.

1898
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,300
That's a good sign of a good stock.

1899
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:23,300
I did do chicken bones.

1900
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:25,300
The chicken fat solidified.

1901
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:28,300
How did you make your soup to where it's solidified?

1902
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:30,300
It just got hard.

1903
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:34,300
Not hard, but it just became one solid mass.

1904
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,300
Really.

1905
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:38,300
So chicken grill, honestly.

1906
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:39,300
Yeah.

1907
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,300
A little bit.

1908
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:46,300
I mean, it was delicious though.

1909
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:47,300
I was so surprised.

1910
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:50,300
I like not to get back on soup talk.

1911
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,300
I'm already getting back on soup talk.

1912
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:55,300
I roasted all the vegetables first and all I did was

1913
01:13:55,300 --> 01:14:01,300
extra wizard olive oil and paprika.

1914
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:04,300
And I roasted it in the oven for 30 minutes.

1915
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:08,300
And then I added it and then I drained the chicken

1916
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:12,300
bones out and like kept the stock and then

1917
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,300
I added the lentils to boil.

1918
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:16,300
The lentils was really good.

1919
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:18,300
And I found a soup.

1920
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:19,300
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1921
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:20,300
This sounds so boring.

1922
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:24,300
I found a soup broth mix, which I'm really excited to use.

1923
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:28,300
So I'm going to use up all my red lentils first.

1924
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:31,300
And then I'm going to buy this soup broth mix,

1925
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,300
which looks so good, by the way.

1926
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:35,300
It has like all these delicious little lentils.

1927
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:39,300
It's like green split pea and red and like barley as well,

1928
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:40,300
which is good for you.

1929
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:43,300
And I think it's called black-eyed pea lentils or something

1930
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:44,300
like that.

1931
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,300
And they're really delicious.

1932
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:49,300
They're almost like slimy texture when they're cooked.

1933
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:50,300
I just think it's really nice.

1934
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:53,300
I think they're yummy.

1935
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:57,300
And it helps me get like more vegetables in as well

1936
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,300
because I always eat vegetables.

1937
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:04,300
I drink fruit juices, like actual 100% mashed up fruit juices.

1938
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:07,300
But I want to try mummy's cooking.

1939
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:08,300
I have terrible news.

1940
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:10,300
I never write down the recipe.

1941
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:11,300
I just wing it.

1942
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:15,300
I'm like channeling my medieval peasant history

1943
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:18,300
and my family's lineage and just being like,

1944
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:19,300
eh, that'll do.

1945
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,300
Into the broth it goes.

1946
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:22,300
That'll be fine.

1947
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:24,300
A bit of salt and I'll call it a day.

1948
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:26,300
Black-eyed feed, doesn't that sound like?

1949
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,300
No, like that's an actual lentil.

1950
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,300
They've got like little black dots on them

1951
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,300
and they're called like black-eyed lentils.

1952
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:34,300
Whoopsies.

1953
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:37,300
If you come to a con, could you please bring us some food?

1954
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,300
I bring shortbread, why not?

1955
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:40,300
Stew, crusty.

1956
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:43,300
Ah, I forgot fucking baguettes again!

1957
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,300
Shit!

1958
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:49,300
I forgot to get crusty bread for my chomp.

1959
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:51,300
Why am I born like this?

1960
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:53,300
And no, I'm not going back to the shops.

1961
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:54,300
I don't want to go outside.

1962
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,300
I'm actually right.

1963
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,300
So here's the tea.

1964
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:00,300
So I've been getting food delivered to my house.

1965
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:03,300
Either takeaway or like actual food to make stuff with.

1966
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:06,300
But I'm scared to go outside because I don't want to get sick

1967
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,300
because I want to be able to stream

1968
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,300
and I'm worried about getting sick

1969
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:11,300
every time I go outside.

1970
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,300
Like I come in and wash my hands like I'm mini.

1971
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:15,300
I come like, James, James!

1972
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,300
Get off me because I don't want to get sick

1973
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,300
and like I wash my face as well.

1974
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:22,300
And sometimes if I feel really bad

1975
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:24,300
I get a shower when I get back.

1976
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:26,300
So I'm getting really, really scared, okay?

1977
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:27,300
I don't want to get sick.

1978
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:29,300
I want to be with my refunds, okay?

1979
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,300
Even if I'm sick, you already know damn well

1980
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,300
I'm going to be streaming.

1981
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:35,300
I don't care if it's a short stream.

1982
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:36,300
I'll be streaming.

1983
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,300
I'll be like, great.

1984
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:39,300
And today, like I'll have a snuffing nose

1985
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:43,300
and today we're going to learn about viruses.

1986
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,300
Who's ready to learn about the snake oil

1987
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,300
that is virus medicine?

1988
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:49,300
Basically.

1989
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:52,300
If I get sick, but I'm not going to get sick.

1990
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:54,300
And like COVID misses out.

1991
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:55,300
Gay or race?

1992
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:57,300
Yeah.

1993
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:59,300
Well, I don't think you could handle a con.

1994
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:00,300
No, I'm going to...

1995
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:02,300
I don't know either.

1996
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:05,300
I'm going to have to be severely medicated

1997
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:07,300
if I go to a second visit.

1998
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:13,300
What do you mean you're scared of going in the outside world?

1999
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:16,300
Yeah, sometimes.

2000
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:21,300
Snake oil sales.

2001
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,300
If you get bad sleep, you will get sick.

2002
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:24,300
Can you...

2003
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:26,300
You can't get virus from sleeping though.

2004
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:28,300
Just a little anesthesia.

2005
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:32,300
Well, the medicine I take to go outside for that

2006
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:34,300
does put your brain to sleep.

2007
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,300
It's the Azepam in particular.

2008
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:39,300
And it's hard to remember everything.

2009
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:41,300
Or for me as in...

2010
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:44,300
The sun is a deadly laser.

2011
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,300
Doesn't sound fun if you're completely out of your mind

2012
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:48,300
jogged up at a convention.

2013
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:49,300
Just don't go.

2014
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,300
Five head true real.

2015
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:53,300
No sleep awakens your immune system?

2016
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,300
Lack of sleep weakens.

2017
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,300
Oh, weakens!

2018
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,300
Not weakens.

2019
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:00,300
It weakens your immune system?

2020
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:01,300
Hold on.

2021
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:04,300
Lack of sleep immune system.

2022
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,300
Hold on.

2023
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:07,300
Hacker man, I'm in.

2024
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:08,300
We're about to get...

2025
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,300
Yes, lack of sleep can affect your immune system.

2026
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:12,300
Studies show that people who don't get quality sleep

2027
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:15,300
are enough or lightly to get sick after being exposed to a virus

2028
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,300
such as the common cold.

2029
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:25,300
Merda putana!

2030
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,300
Shit!

2031
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:30,300
That mean I can't go outside anymore?

2032
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,300
Not without rest, shit.

2033
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:49,300
I was kinda enjoying getting all my veggies and stuff.

2034
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:52,300
Cause I can't order the veggies.

2035
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:53,300
Order.

2036
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,300
No, I never finished it.

2037
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:57,300
So I never said it.

2038
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,300
I can't...

2039
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:00,300
Can't what?

2040
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:03,300
I can't get fresh vegetables delivered.

2041
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:07,300
Cause they always put the freaking thing that's about to expire the next day

2042
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:10,300
when you get like the home delivery thing.

2043
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:12,300
So, yeah.

2044
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:14,300
Just live like us and become a neat.

2045
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:18,300
I mean, I'm technically already there.

2046
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,300
Lack of sleep affects so much.

2047
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:23,300
Immune function can give you spots.

2048
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,300
That's really random.

2049
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:26,300
Gain weight and pair cognitive function.

2050
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,300
Probably cognitive function.

2051
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,300
I have to admit, if you...

2052
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,300
Those slides were wild.

2053
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,300
Like, I'm not even being funny.

2054
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:34,300
What the fuck...

2055
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:36,300
Is in it wildly inappropriate?

2056
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:37,300
Probably is.

2057
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:40,300
What the fuck is the fruit bat slide?

2058
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:43,300
Literally, what the fuck is that?

2059
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:44,300
A fruit bat.

2060
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:47,300
And instead of putting like a piece of fruit, like a strawberry,

2061
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:52,300
I said it was like a bit more like...

2062
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:53,300
Yeah.

2063
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,300
Talk about being cognitively impaired.

2064
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:56,300
Like, what even is this?

2065
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:58,300
Intermission, hydration check.

2066
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:00,300
And then I literally have what sound effect?

2067
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:03,300
Like...

2068
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,300
Oh wait, you can't even hear that.

2069
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,300
Oh no, wait, you didn't hear that sound effect?

2070
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:08,300
I don't know.

2071
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:09,300
Oh, maybe you did.

2072
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:12,300
Like, what?

2073
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:14,300
So yeah, like my bat.

2074
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:15,300
Literally a fruit bat.

2075
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:17,300
Like, bro, how wildly inappropriate is that?

2076
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,300
It's like, ehhh, ehhh, ehhh, ehhh, ehhh, ehhh.

2077
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:21,300
Shut the fuck up, that's not how it works.

2078
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,300
You already know how that's not how it works.

2079
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,300
Oh, we all know that's not how it works.

2080
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:27,300
It's not how it works.

2081
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,300
Ligma is a fruit though.

2082
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,300
What?

2083
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,300
No, it's not a fruit.

2084
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:37,300
It's ligma or fruit.

2085
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:39,300
Am I being pranked?

2086
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:42,300
It's ligma or fruit.

2087
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:43,300
It's...

2088
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:51,260

2149
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:19,500

01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:29,100
video as well you'll be be old actually hi bleeding heart video sounds good but

2166
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:11,580
my own it's scary to deal with last time I was living by myself someone tried to

2167
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:22,620
kick my front door and put a born-in dog sign out front there was like a pull

2168
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:27,060
done by thieves and if you have a beware of dog sign a lot of them get deterred

2169
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:31,340
and it's better to deter a percentage of them than all of them even if you don't

2170
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:36,060
have a yapper wouldn't that just sound like pouring water in your mic if you
