74160	80800	mm-hmm. And then this one is just neutral B tier, it's a guy going, I mean, it's all right.
80800	87440	And then this one is, it's the biggest piece of ever. And then this one says cast it into
87440	99360	Mount Doom. And this freaking webcam doesn't, oh focus, what I told it to. So yeah, it's been,
99360	103680	it's been a bit of a nightmare to get here but Ken, what we're here now. So let me, let me just
103680	110400	check. Okay, I can officially see tips. So if you would like to tip, I will see it. And I can

142400	151520	color. Look, look at that little adorable little Pyro Pops. And look, it's even got the hurt ears

157920	168320	big heel reach. Look, it's strawberry, darling straw. You know, darling straw, this is her mascot.
172480	179040	Got a little bowl, and got a little butt. Sorry, a bunch of the webcam's rubbish,
179040	184720	but it's probably, oh, it's glitching. But yeah, look, I got Pyro Pops and a straw,
185600	190880	plushie, and I got Gura, and I got a few other things on the way, but they're not here yet,
190880	195360	it's totally not over market. Check out the link in the description for the merch down below.
196800	204480	Your nails are so shiny, right? Right, right, before we get into the actual taste testing,
205440	213280	do you know how they freaking destroyed my toe? So if you didn't know, when you get a manicure
213280	219360	and a pedicure, you have to get cut around here. They like cut all your skin away here, right?
220240	227360	They cut into me, and this one doesn't have like all this on it. So I just, yeah, I got manicure
227360	231600	and a pedicure. I'm not beating the sweaty feet allegations because I don't know if you can hear
231600	239760	this, but yeah, like the paper's lifting with my feet. But yeah, I got manicure and a pedicure
241840	247600	for the monetization stream. However, it's not going to stop me. I mean, look at,
249520	255040	I'm a real girl now, huh? I'm so feminine. I'm so feminine. You're going to be eating
255040	259760	with your feet on the table. You sure you want to stick your feet on it? What are you talking about?
259760	268240	Okay, let's, let's get into the first thing. We are going to be trying there.
271120	277040	Okay. So basically, I have to manually freaking draw what tear I'm putting I am in as well. Like,
277040	285280	it's just, it is what it is. So we're going to try a little Nerdy's. Anyone else? I don't find
285280	293200	it nerd. It says pill tab here. I'm pulling and I'm ripping the box apart. It's not looking good.
293200	298720	It says one and two on the side. Oh no, it's a logic puzzle we're feeling. It literally says,
299520	308480	where's the webcam? Oh, focus on this is terrible. It says, okay, we can't even, it's a puzzle.
308480	314160	Okay, there we go. We're in. We're in. Yep, this is how you're supposed to do it. Oh,
314240	318960	there's two different colors. Oops. Wait, what's, okay, hold on. Let's just take
318960	326240	our part. You know, oh my God. Okay, okay. Okay, there's two little sections. We have two
326240	330960	clores. Choose your clore, any clore. Okay, we're gonna, we're gonna have pink.
335760	340320	Oh, oh, that's sweet. It's purple, the same flavor.
344240	349040	Oh, that's so sweet. It's almost sour. Oh, is this supposed to be sour?
349920	363520	Grape and strawberry. Okay. Um, oh, uh, grape is not for me at all. I will allow, I will allow,
363520	371360	um, uh, I'm gonna put it in a, I mean, it's all right. Hold on, we're like manually,
371680	376560	I don't know. Now everyone knows I can't draw straight balls. Okay, what do nerds look like?
381440	386320	I mean, it's all right. And then the packaging is pink and purple, but I don't have a pink and
386320	392480	purple pencil. Yeah, the grape flavor is very diverse. Yeah, strawberry is my preferred over
392480	399520	grape. Yeah, I'm definitely strawberry gang, straw, straw. Draw the little guys. Oh, they have like
399520	409040	a schnozer. Okay, hold on. And then they're butt and then their feet. And then their eyeballs.
410080	416400	And then their little happy face. What do we think? What do we think of my nerds?
416720	430400	That wasn't too bad. I love it. Oh, you want to see, you want to see the, oh, right. Okay, hold on.
430400	435680	There's like so much I wanted to show in this stream, like so, so much. I was originally gonna wear
435680	442240	this outfit for you guys, but then I was like, oh, I can't because YouTube is reviewing my channel.
442960	449120	But I got, so if you didn't know, the white on my outfit is pearlescent, like it's rainbow-esque.
449120	454240	Okay, it's pearlescent. So I got that. And then this is like, this is what the white on my costume
454240	460240	is. It's pearlescent. I don't even see it that well. I don't wear it. Be careful, American
460240	465840	sweets are super sugary. I'm not gonna eat like, eat, eat everything. But you know what I'm gonna
465840	477920	wash it down with? A fucking can of, oh no. Little, little ASMR moment. This is what,
480240	483840	I'm sorry if you don't like hand sticks. I'm afraid I have hand sticks.
486880	492320	With all my might as I shake car battery juice, the national drink of Scotland, Scotland is the
492320	502160	only country in the whole wide world, the whole wide world that has number one sales, not cola.
502960	505440	So cheers, come pie.
511600	516960	Insert bagpipe noises here. That's so good. I've not had that in ages. Right, let me put it down.
516960	520880	The reason why we're sipping into the iron brewers, I put it on the table over there because I'm
521600	530800	gonna knock it off. We have two drinks to try from America. Oh, if you have a can on your desk,
530800	538080	that's 355 milliliters, also known as 12 fluid ounces. This is what my hand looks like holding it.
539120	544480	My fingies don't even get like up there. I'm getting a lot of condensation though.
545440	554720	We're gonna try cream, soda, A and W as the condensation. Okay, ready. We're gonna try the
554720	561840	drinks first. Oh my, oh such a girl. This is not hand sweat before anyone starts making fun.
561920	564320	Okay, you guys, come pie.
572800	576640	Yes, that is a drink. Okay.
580160	586640	It's not, I mean, it's not right. It's not that, it's actually not that bad. I wouldn't reach for it.
586640	591440	Oh, I missed tips. I'm so sorry. I'm such a bad streamer. Thank you, tiny spiny for the tip,
591440	595120	just as a promise. I have some iron brew with me and I just had some. No idea how to describe
595120	599520	the taste, but it tastes better than it smells. Might have to get more of this going forward.
599520	604800	Yay, thank you for the tip. Zion, thank you for the tip. When you have to be a good Christian
604800	608880	man on Sunday but cuddles the stream and you do what you have to do and chin in with some one
608880	615120	earbud while Mass is going, when can the reeflings taste the Scottish sweets? Honestly, thank you
615120	620800	for the tip. I can't believe you're in church right now. Take me to church right now. I'm putting
620800	626000	all the drinks up on this little shelf because there's a 100% chance I'm going to knock over.
627680	632240	Honestly, that wasn't that bad but I wouldn't go out my way to have it. I feel like everything's
632240	636960	going to end up being neutral. Right, what was that? That was A and W and it's like on its side
636960	646240	like this. A and W, like that. And then it's got like a little logo. It's like two circles.
647040	657600	I mean, it's alright. Okay, now we're trying American Dr Pepper. 150 calories per serving.
657600	662640	So not for the full can. Oh no, the serving size is a can. Some things do that where the
662640	673360	serving size is a lie. It's a false profit. Okay. Get the aroma, that's right. Get the aroma in
673360	690000	your palate. Yes, yes, have it. Okay. Uh-huh. Oh, oh, it's going to be, you guys drink that stuff?
690880	694640	What is that flavor? I don't even know what the flavor is. There's something wrong with it anyway.
695920	700560	Oh, I should see my head bobbing up and down. Oh, that's my head there. See that? That's that's
700960	705440	the headset, Mike, but I'm going to talk to you through that, Mike. That's moody.
706560	716560	Dr Pepper Gaming, 23 flavors. Is that why there's 20? Oh my goodness. Right. I'm sorry to my Dr
718080	724640	Pepper fans. It's not cast it into the fires of Mint Doom. I'm more or I guess it's technically
724640	734720	correct. What does the front look like? A Dr Pepper. And then what's got 23 flavors? Oh my
734720	744080	god, 23. She's not the one she's talked to Pepper. Yeah, that, my brain was like nothing.
745360	752640	Right. Y'all want a kiss? Oh, sugar. I never thought this far ahead.
754960	761680	Oh god, I never thought this far ahead. No, the packaging. I'm getting trolled. The
761680	768160	fucking thing came open. It's not open. I'm getting trolled. Hold on. I never brought a knife. I never
768160	777120	thought to broaden what? No, your troll. Oh, there we go. Oh my god. These are like those kisses.
777120	784080	I remember there were so many memes online that are like, oh, you should, you should what?
784160	789280	It was like, oh, ask your crush if she wants a kiss. And if she says no and rejects you,
789280	794160	just pull out a Hershey's kiss from your pocket. And then all the comments were like, oh, what?
795680	799840	Is this a, is there a joke on the back? No, there's not. Okay, there's not a joke on the back.
799840	810960	It's not fortune cookie. Okay, gobble, gobble. Oh, it's hard. Wait, is it hard? Oh no, I had it
810960	823360	in the fridge. That's why it's hard. Why is it? I do have a napkin to remove food from my mouth
823360	827280	that I no longer wish to have in my mouth. So I do apologize if people don't like that.
828080	834960	It melts in your mouth. The cocoa percentage is a bit better.
835600	849200	I think I can swallow it. Oh, that's better. Oh, I'm fine. I'm chewing through it.
850480	862880	It stuck to my teeth. Okay, okay. Oh, I would not have a second one. I'm so sorry. I wouldn't.
863520	871120	All right, we'll see how it ambidextrous. All right, let me just draw in the second box. Hold on.
873680	877920	Easy, easy, easy.
881040	883600	By the way, I got manicure and pedicure. Did you see?
887200	891680	Oh, I also know the Vietnamese strats. So Boss Lady was the one,
892400	898000	there was two ladies working on me at once. What was that? A kisses. So there was two ladies working
898000	910400	on me at once and it turns out it was the boss and she was telling me about her visa and she was
910400	918400	like, oh, I had two children so they can't kick me out and I was like, you're smart. And she was
918480	922080	like, yeah, if they want to kick me out, they have to take me to family court. And I was like,
922080	926880	she's telling me the Vietnamese strats. I'm like, you're an actual five head for that. So we're
926880	932560	having to be giggle about that. So I definitely recommend what they call, I think they're called
932560	938400	chop shop nail bars when it's just like a bunch of girls and all that. So there was two women working
938400	946480	on me and the women that was kindly working on my feet, she didn't speak any English, which is fine.
946480	950080	So we never spoke or anything, but I spoke a little bit to the owner because she was doing
951040	959120	the manicure. And basically, so I paid and then I went away and I got some cash out so I could
959120	965120	give them a tip. And I gave the one that didn't speak English a tip and she was like, thank you,
965120	969840	thank you. And I'm like, yeah, you worked hard. I couldn't really use a lot of words because I
969840	975920	knew she didn't understand what they meant. But she was so lovely. Honestly, they worked so hard
975920	980800	in these like nail bars. And then I gave the owner a tip as well. And because I was like, just thank
980800	986000	you for being so nice because I walked in and I was like, I need French tip manicure, pedicure. I
986000	989040	had don't know what it is because she was like, do you want gel? Do you want this? And I'm like,
989040	994720	I don't know what any of this means. And she was like, it's okay, I look after you and her amazing
994720	1001040	accent. And it was amazing. So I had a very good time. It was really relaxing. They started
1001040	1008720	like massaging my feet. And I was trying so hard. Right, right. This is the truth. Okay. So they
1008720	1013200	massaged this bottom part of the feet. All right. But with someone touches the bottom of my feet,
1013200	1018880	my feet go, I start to spread my toes. So I was like, no, stop, stop. She's trying to work on my
1018880	1027920	feet. But my toes were like, so I was like trying to sell my body. I was trying to tell my body,
1027920	1032720	stop moving. This poor woman is trying to like massage my feet and give me a relaxed experience.
1032720	1039520	And all my toes want to do is go, like, no, just relax. But anyway, it was a really good
1039520	1043600	experience. It was really relaxing. The chair started vibrating. I started sweating as well in
1043600	1052480	the chair. It was like vibrating me up and down. I was like, oh, right. This is all I hear about
1052480	1057680	from you Americans watching right now. I don't know what summer patch kids is, but all I hear
1057680	1065520	about it is how good they are. It says sour, then sweet. If it's a gummy, like chewy, I love chewy
1065520	1077920	sweets. So this is actually going to go quite down well. They look adorable. These are cute ones.
1077920	1085600	I like the look of these. So they're chewy. This will hurt your teeth. It is gummy. They're okay.
1085840	1087600	Ready? Bottoms up.
1094080	1095920	Okay, we had a good start, but...
1102320	1110000	Y'all eat this shit. Where did the flavor go? One earth? Wait, there was so much flavor
1110000	1114320	at the start and it's all gone. It tastes like nothing. It just like gels them.
1116240	1125200	Where's your flavor? Oh, it's so plain. I don't think I want to swallow this. Hold on a minute.
1125200	1131680	What the heck is even in here? Sugar, sugar, corn syrup, modified corn starch, contains less than
1131680	1138480	two percent citric acid. What the heck is the flavor in? Artificial flavors, titanium,
1139440	1146400	dioxide for color. There's literally nothing in it. What on earth? Wait, I'm not swallowing that.
1146400	1156640	Sorry, I don't trust it. I don't trust it. It's too suspicious. It's too suspicious. I'm sorry.
1157360	1163280	That tasted flavor. I'm sorry to anyone who like silver patch watermelon. You're done.
1164000	1170080	Your taste buds are cooked beyond belief. Nothing happened. You get the burst of sugar at the start
1170080	1174960	and then nothing happened. So I do apologize to silver patch kids. Right, we're just going to
1174960	1181280	draw this little mask out here. So he's got his little head and then he's got his wee arm out to
1181280	1187280	the side and he's holding the watermelon and he does this and he goes down and does this and
1187840	1192640	this and then he does that and then he goes like this and then he and then back to the head
1192640	1199360	and again the ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. And then he doesn't really have features. There we go.
1201200	1204960	Silver patch kids, I'm so sorry but nothing happened when I bit into that which is
1205840	1212240	rather strange. It's odd. Sweet taste, the carcinogenic that a bloody old knot. Oh speaking
1212240	1219360	of carcinogenics, neon blue. I got access to neon blue peeps. Now I'll tell you this.
1220320	1227920	What's her face? Trisha Payes is an influencer and she ate these on camera and made them look
1227920	1234480	like the most delicious thing ever. Wait, why are you saying no to peeps? Are they bad? But they're
1234480	1241760	gleaming and green and fat free. Fat free just means it's all in the sugar. They're like neon
1241760	1248080	blue. I don't know how to explain to you how neon blue these are but these are neon. They're horrible.
1248080	1258160	Oh no. They look so adorable. I'm eating sheepsters right now. Oh, well come with me. Am I gonna,
1258160	1262240	all right, vote someone if I'm gonna spit this out or not. From your guys's reactions I'm getting
1262240	1278320	nervous. But look how cute he is. He's very sticky. Oh my. I'm scared.
1279120	1294880	I think I'm gonna gag. Am I gonna gag? I'm so sorry. I'm actually quite scared of it. I'm scared
1294880	1306960	of the bunny. I'm so sorry. I think I didn't spit that out. I apologize. Okay, I got taste. I actually
1306960	1315120	don't think it's that bad but I'm genuinely scared of it. I'm scared of this. Chewing on foam kind
1315120	1322000	of quality. Yeah. Does it taste awful as everyone? It doesn't taste bad but I'm scared to swallow it
1322000	1330480	but I never tasted anything that was bad. I'm just scared. Yeah, it didn't taste bad so it's
1330560	1338560	going in. I wouldn't eat it of my own violation again. Volition, violation. So it's going into the,
1338560	1343280	it's not, it didn't make it here. What does it, what does the box look like? Where's the box? Oh,
1343280	1350080	peeps doesn't really have much of an icon. It's just kind of peeps. Volition, vial, of my own
1350080	1356080	violin. I would not eat this again. Peeps. And then it's just got a circle. Oh, again,
1356080	1363440	I messed it up and an underling. Ta-da! Oh yeah, it's all coming together. Oh, pardon me, I'm burping
1363440	1369040	out. Oh, I never even thought that I could throw up this stream but it's now just occurred to me
1369040	1374640	the likelihood of me throwing up is actually very high. Can I get a TWS check if throwing up on
1374640	1383520	streamers allowed? Yes or no? Right, going on the back, sweeps, shriek-p-d-p-p-d's. I've got Twinkie!
1383520	1390080	And there's literally a zombie movie that's all about the dang twangie. So please, we'll
1390080	1402400	live up to the hype of the twinkie. Yeah, please. I mean, zombie land. Oh yeah. Okay, we're doing a
1402480	1408080	twangie. Oh, it's all coming apart. Uh, itadakimasu!
1413520	1418320	Okay, a sponge cake. We can manage that. What about the filling?
1420880	1424880	I've stuck my tongue in the filling, as you can see by the evidence of the in-groove.
1424880	1440800	Okay, I'm tasting it. It is going in the it's all right tier. Okay, it's going in the it's all
1440800	1445440	right tier. That's not bad. I wouldn't say that was bad. Twinkie is just sponge cake and cream.
1446400	1451280	It's going in the, well, anything. I actually don't know what the brand of Twinkie looks like.
1451280	1463440	And this just says hostess on it. We will create one, and then it stands for
1463440	1470080	two. There we go. New logo for Twinkie right there. And then we'll put it in.
1472000	1478560	We'll just do like the actual size. There we go. Twinkie. That's the new logo for Twinkie.
1481280	1486640	It'll be interesting to see how your hands keep on ticking. I've got Twizzlers, which is
1486640	1490880	Eric Cartman is my only exposure to Twizzlers. I'm pretty sure he was munching them in one of the
1490880	1500560	plots. Also, I got rinsed for all of this food. It cost me 53 zollas. Oh my god, they're sticky.
1501280	1511040	Wait, they're not? Oh, there is an artificial scent that has just came from this. Oh my god,
1511040	1518880	it's not come from fucking hell. I actually haven't used my strength, you know? Okay, hold on.
1521040	1525040	Oh my god, it's so sticky. Like, oh.
1527760	1533200	What is this? They're decent. It's very artificial scent has entered the room.
1533760	1539520	What is it? It's artificial cherry flavour?
1544880	1550720	Why does everything say a low fat snack that makes sugar turns into fat? Why is everything
1550720	1558080	marketed like that? It's so dumb. Oh, I'm tasting it. I'm tasting it. In my mouth,
1558480	1560560	those two little samples that were on my finger.
1564160	1570240	It's like edible scentless candle. These are sea bomb sticks. They're health candy because
1570240	1577280	everything in America is high fat. Big sugar. Americans believe fat is bad, but sugar is what
1577280	1582320	makes fat. Fat isn't bad for you. It depends on what kind of animal fat is good for you. For
1582320	1588640	example. Oh, everything is good for you in moderation. I'm still tasting that.
1591840	1597200	I don't think I would eat this of my own violin. Violin again. Okay, I'll say that. Do you guys
1597200	1601600	want that? I don't think I could finish it. Do you guys want to take over here and
1601600	1608400	you finish it for me? Yeah? Okay, there you go. All yours go. Yeah, the focus does not work on
1608400	1615520	this webcam very well. It's all yours. You can have it. I would... Oh, it's back again. I thought
1615520	1620240	I wiped it on the napkin. It's already back. Oh, you spat it out too? My pretty little baby bird.
1620240	1626480	I would not put that in my mouth again. No, I don't apologize to any Twizzler fans.
1629760	1637280	And then it says pool. Oh, I just noticed that pool and peel. Anyone else pooling right now?
1637360	1644720	Because I'll be peeling something back later. This joke doesn't work because I'm doing an American
1644720	1651360	stream and you guys get something stolen from you at birth, but let's not get into that.
1651360	1654480	How about some Jolly Ranchers?
1654640	1660000	Any Jolly Ranchers?
1665120	1670000	Oh, jeez, you need the freaking strength to open anything. My god, do you guys
1670000	1675440	even get into these? Right, what clore? Choose your clore. Any clore? What are the clores? Right,
1675440	1681600	we've got a red, we've got a yellow, we've got an orangue. Orangue. We've got green.
1685040	1686880	So any other colors or clore colors?
1689440	1698240	Okay, I think there's four colors. We've got lime green, hard candy mango,
1699600	1709520	and golden pineapple and fruit punch. No way, there's no blue. Wait, I've got Jolly Ranchers
1709520	1716640	tropical. Is that the wrong one? Did I mess up? Wait, hold on, hold on. No, there's definitely no
1716640	1727760	blue in here. Unless my elf eyes deceive me. And the wise words of Orlando blue himself.
1730000	1737760	Don't bite them. Suck them. Oh yeah, you want me to suck on the sweet? Right, well I do a pool.
1737760	1744880	Hold on, let me, you guys can vote what flavor I try. Let me, for those of you participating at home,
1744880	1753920	please feel free to use the starter poll. What's this called? Jolly Rancher? I've spelled that
1753920	1763520	wrong, but that's fine. We've got fruit punch and it's red. We've got mango, which is orangue.
1764320	1776720	We've got yellow, which is pineapple yellow. Or last but certainly not least green, green
1776720	1783120	lime. For those of you playing at home, folks, feel free to go into the comment section where you
1783120	1791440	will see a poll pop up on your screen. That's right, you, the viewer, can decide if what the streamer
1791440	1805280	eats. Let's see. Oh, fruit punch red. Okay, okay. Je comprende. I just realized it's using my old
1805280	1814160	freaking description sense or red gang raise up. Okay, so someone says don't bait it, just suckle on
1814160	1822080	it. Is it suckling ASMR? I'll suckle on something in a minute. That is so red. Holy crap. That's like
1822080	1830080	red of a pencil and that's the sweet red. I'm getting nervous. I'm getting shaky.
1830320	1840000	Oh, very strong, very strong flavor, but let it cook, let it marinate, give it a chance.
1848800	1855360	Yes. That is very strong. That is very strong flavor. I'm not even going to
1855360	1857600	be getting otherwise. What the fuck? That's so fun.
1865840	1876000	Is it sour? It's just overwhelming. I think my British, my British beans, I just want bread
1876080	1877680	and butter and cheese and ham.
1886720	1896320	How fried is America's taste buds? Are your taste buds fried at all? That is so strong.
1896320	1905200	They're all fried. Yeah, I like savory flavors. This is probably the worst for me.
1907760	1914960	American taste buds are 99% sweet. Okay. The British can't, yeah, the British palate
1914960	1918960	definitely can't. I can't. This is very, this is too much. I can't eat this.
1919040	1928480	Mm-hmm. I feel like an old lady sucking on a hard boiled sweet. Oh, you just,
1928480	1934320	you just be a good wee grandson. I'm bracing myself on my chair. I'm not even going to
1934320	1938400	pretend otherwise. My other hand is on my chair and I'm bracing myself for these sweets.
1942640	1948240	Well, if anyone else wants to take over, you're more than welcome to. I have had adequate tasting
1948240	1952640	and the aroma of the sweet has came through. So if anyone would like to take over, go.
1955680	1959840	All yours, baby. All yours because I like my fingers so they're not sticky.
1963760	1967200	Have a little, have a little napkin for dabbing my fingies. Meals and calls.
1968480	1975520	Right. That was overwhelming and I wouldn't put it back in my mouth again. I'm sorry. A lot of
1975520	1979280	things. I wouldn't say cast it into the fire. That's not like rejection, but I just wouldn't.
1980400	1989040	What's the logo of jolly ranchers? It's just a big J-O-L-L-Y-O and then a Ruh and then a Ruh
1989040	1994560	and then a N and then a C-H-E-R. It's so hard to like jump between the two. And then it says hard
1994560	2004320	candy. Okay, that's close enough. Our list so far. Do you think anything can even become
2004320	2007280	A-T here at this rate? I'm getting nervous. I don't, I don't think it's going to work.
2008800	2014880	It's not looking good. I will post this in high quality after the stream under the tweet because
2014880	2020400	I actually tweet for once. I just don't like Twitter. Twitter is for doing something very
2020400	2027920	nefarious on and then closing it 10 minutes after. We'll go that movie. Is this not in the Goonies?
2027920	2032960	That movie Babe Ruth. Right, because the guy wanted a baby roof.
2035440	2042080	We need some more, some Reese's. I never got Reese's pieces, should have. Reese's pup, Reese's pup.
2042080	2045760	Eat em up, eat em up, eat em up, eat em up. Reese's pup.
2046320	2055520	Oh, there's a big ass peanut bar. Thank God I'm not allergic to peanut bar. I had no idea what was
2055520	2061120	inside this. Thank God I don't have a nut allergy. That could have went terribly wrong.
2062000	2077280	Mmm. Honestly? Not bad. I can't believe it. I think we've done it. I think we have an A-T here.
2078400	2084000	I'm not bad. We're even taking a double bait ladies and gentlemen. That's right.
2084560	2092320	Oh, a peanut. Just for me. We have an A-T here. Okay. I can put that on the A-T here.
2094800	2099120	I hope I'm not choking. I better not be. Let's see. We've got an A-T here on...
2100880	2107360	Who are you? Babe Ruth. Oh, maybe I'm choking a little bit. Hold on. I better not be freaking
2107360	2111680	allergic to peanuts. Are you joking me? Hold on. Let me get iron bro. Not like I'm broken,
2111680	2115760	resurrect a situation. Literally, I don't need to go to A&E. Cheers.
2121440	2124240	Okay. I think the peanut was getting stuck in my throat. I'm not actually allergic.
2125360	2130560	Oh, that is farted. Did you hear that fart? I didn't fart. The thing farted before
2131360	2142240	reducing. We did it. We have... Iron bro doubles as an epipen. True. True. Right. We've got
2143760	2151520	mate and ache. Original fruits. Chewy assorted fruit fans. I like chewy fruit. Oh, push
2151520	2158880	here to open. Oh my god. Oh my goodness sake. How do you push it? Oh my... Wait. Is there like
2158960	2162880	an outline or am I being pranked? Right. Am I being pranked? This is push to open. I'm...
2163920	2168880	Look at the red on my finger. Tell me I'm not pushing right now. Tell me I'm not pushing right now.
2170560	2175120	I'm getting freaking pranked by these. What am I supposed to do? What... Oh, I missed.
2176560	2182320	What am I supposed to do? Push here to open. Well, I'm bloody trying. Right. Fuck you. Honestly.
2182960	2190240	That's... Right. Anyway. Plore is true to plore. Oh, these are jelly beans. Oh, I'm gonna like these.
2190240	2200240	Um, I'm trying. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. S tier. We've done it. We've done it. We've done it, ladies and
2200240	2208560	gentlemen. Jelly bean. We've got fruit flavor. Come on. What more do you want? Mate and ache.
2208560	2212960	Come on. I knew I was gonna like that. I looked at that and I knew I was gonna like that right
2212960	2216160	away. I mean, look at that. Look at that beautiful people. Should I just leave like little sweets
2216160	2223680	everywhere? Just a little chip. Oh, what's that? I'll try the green one. Okay, maybe not the green
2223680	2230080	one as an ache to your... You want the green one instead? You guys can have the green one,
2230080	2236320	but I'll have the other ones, okay? Mm-hmm. All right, green one didn't taste that nice.
2239520	2248480	Me singing the praise. Okay, we've got milk duds not to be confused with milk ducks. Okay,
2248480	2254640	don't get it twisted. It's instructions. Okay, we're going for it. Candy made with chocolate
2254640	2266400	and caramelia. Any caramelians? Oh, caramel... Wait, caramel dancing. Whoa. Wait, there's no
2266480	2275680	protective film? Like, at all? There's no protective film in the box or that the candy is in?
2277680	2285680	Monca S? Shouldn't there be a protective film? Question mark? Question mark? Oh, I'm scared to
2285680	2292000	eat this now. I'm going to take half, okay? All right, no, I can't. There's caramel.
2302160	2306720	You know what the British candy called rebels is? Rebels, maybe?
2307120	2318960	Mm-hmm. I don't hate it. It's not S tier, but I think it's A. I think that's the second
2318960	2325360	A tier. I like that. I would eat... I would put another piece in my mouth again. See, if I wouldn't
2325360	2333280	put... Or maybe it's B tier, I don't know. A or B. I've got lotion on my tentacle, or I mean it's
2333520	2339280	or... I've not got lotion on my tentacle right now. Sorry. Sorry for the milk duds. Milk.
2340160	2344800	It's stuck on my teeth, by the way. I just want you to know. Do you guys want any? Hold on. I got
2344800	2356800	it kind of hard. There you go. It's really stuck on my teeth. Holy crap. It's really, really stuck
2356800	2360800	on my teeth. I think I'm just gonna have to give up chewing and just put it on the...
2361760	2369760	But that isn't that bad. Not a good look, LaLa. Oh, that's really stuck. Where's my water?
2369760	2374640	I bought a water. I bought a water. I brought a water. Hold on.
2380560	2385120	Need it. Oh, please don't fall on it. Please don't fall on it. Please keep it inside. It's okay.
2386000	2391920	Oh no, no, don't. It's fine. It's fine. I'm okay. Wait, how fast am I getting through these? I think
2391920	2401600	I've like practically already done them all. Right. Mercy told me I'm supposed to finish on...
2402640	2408480	Oh, I still got the wires twisted now. Mercy told me I'm supposed to finish on one of these
2408480	2413440	flavours of crisps because they're so overpowering, but I think it's the tackies.
2415600	2423200	I can't remember. I think the tackies I'm to finish on, so we'll try chi-o's.
2424720	2431200	Chicky bit of chi-o's. They are flavoured. Flame it. Please don't, please don't throw up.
2433760	2440720	There shouldn't be this much trap wind. I'm getting nervous. Okay, I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. It's
2440720	2446560	fine. It's it. That was the bag farting because my hands are sweaty if you heard that. See, little
2447600	2457280	my hands are nicest. Get the flavour up that nose. Big ol' sniff it a whiff. All right, hold on.
2458400	2468960	Let us take... They're like red. Okay. Bottoms up, yeah.
2470720	2482480	Is that cheese? Is that cheese and hot? High taste?
2487680	2494960	I think... Is that cheese? Yeah, that's cheese. I need to do the spice. Hmm.
2495600	2503120	Burning my tongue a wee bit. Not like flavour burn, like actual burn.
2505120	2512160	What do we think? That's honestly... Would I eat it again? Maybe?
2514240	2521120	All chi-o's have cheese. It's in the name. Oh, chi-o's. Am I saying them wrong? Chi-to's. Oh,
2521120	2528720	no, it is chi-to's. Cheese-to's. No, yes. Okay, they all have cheese and I've got it.
2529920	2534320	Honestly, that's not that bad. That's not that bad. I think I would actually eat that again. I
2534320	2540320	might finish this off. Hold on. That's gonna get an A tier for me. What are they? Cheese-to's.
2541120	2544240	Cheese-to's. There we go. Cheese-to's.
2544880	2552960	Living out. Did I put down the other ones that I just tasted? Yeah. I'll put the crisps on the floor.
2554640	2558240	Honestly, I could be that. Right, I believe this is the last
2558240	2562320	sweet I have to taste test and then I could just show you stuff around my room.
2563280	2568640	Because Shibi doesn't go live until two minus one hour in a little bit. Okay, are we ready?
2569200	2578880	Let's, let's see what's inside. Oh, these are like red as well, like chi-to's. Oh, they've got like
2578880	2584480	little tiger stripes. Are they supposed to have tiger stripes on them or is mine just carcinogenic
2584480	2599600	for free? Okay, ready, steady. Oh, they're like natural rolled over.
2614480	2629600	Oh, okay. Okay, my brain has decided. What the frick is even in this?
2632160	2636240	Oh my gosh, it's not even in English. Ingredients.
2644880	2651280	Yeah, I, I, that is so freaking, that is overwhelming. I think that might be a
2651280	2656800	Mount Doom. You know that. I don't know how that's edible. I think we have two Mount Dooms.
2659120	2666880	Love the Italian accent. Yep. I'm so sorry. That's a Mount Doom. I can't, that's inedible.
2666880	2671600	The flavor is overwhelming. There's nothing, there's nothing. Wait, what is the front?
2671600	2680000	The packet looks like, hold on. Oh, it's just a logo, geez. Has anyone got any? What does that say?
2683840	2685680	I don't even know what flavor Fuego is, but.
2689280	2696160	My heart, I'm so sorry. That, there's so much flavor. It's like not even pleasant.
2696720	2706640	Fuego means fire in Spanish. Oh, it means hot. Okay, je comprends. Sorry to any Italian,
2706640	2715120	Italian, sorry to any, uh, Espanol, you know, Viva la Mexico. Um, I think we're done. I can't see
2715120	2721360	any more sweets. I don't have any more sweets. I've eaten them all. Right, what did we rate?
2721360	2728720	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Okay, the only one that
2728720	2735200	made it was a chewy jelly bean, and then a baby Ruth, which is a peanuts, and then the Cheetos,
2735200	2743440	Cheetos, hot. Oh, I just completely skipped on doing that H. Let's see if you can see a bit better.
2743440	2751040	Yeah. And then we see, is that, I think that's from the Cheetos that I was touching. Nerds is,
2751040	2759520	it's all right. A and W, uh, creaming soda. Call me a soda because I'm about to make you cream.
2760560	2769680	Twinkie with their new design logo, milk duds, uh, and then in the, this is the biggest piece of,
2769680	2776720	it's not really, it's just I can't eat it. The Dr Pepper, Nacropeper with the 23 flavors,
2777520	2784880	kisses. Yeah, that was an experience. What the heck does that even say? Peeps. Oh, it says
2784880	2790720	peeps, but I hid the pee. Peeps, I was actually scared to swallow, but I didn't actually taste
2790720	2800160	bad. This is Twizzlers, pool and peel. And then this is Jolly Rancher's Heart Candy, that was
2800160	2807920	again overwhelming. And then the D, which is the mysterious, mysterious watermelon flavor
2807920	2812160	that disappeared the moment you literally put it in your mouth. Like you taste the flavor,
2812160	2818480	the moment it enters and then it's gone. And then unfortunately, Fuego, uh, Takis, uh, are just
2818480	2822560	overwhelming to the point that you do not even have any taste buds by the time you've finished
2822560	2830560	actually eating any of these American snacks. Did you enjoy the poison? I absolutely did. I
2830560	2834960	missed half the stream, but I'm gradually making it. We've got an S tier. That's all I wanted out
2834960	2839360	of this. We've got an S tier. Again, if you're wondering why I'm not using an actual tier maker,
2839360	2843040	it's because I was too pepego, so we're doing it by hand. That's right, ladies and gentlemen,
2843040	2850720	I'm so professional. I did this by hand. Okay. Oh, your voice seems better, by the way. It is
2850720	2859200	slightly better. Um, I did have a T before stream to try and hydrate. Oh, oh wait, hold on.
2861040	2865840	Oh, oh, excuse me. Sorry. I just need to get that pencil one moment, please. Just need to
2867360	2873600	grab the pencil. Oh, thank you. Oh, sorry. Thank you. Yes. Okay. I've got the pencil. That's what
2873600	2878480	I needed it for. Oh, did I tell you I got manicure and pedicure, by the way? Oh,
2880640	2886960	I can show you my little tism. I don't know if I've told you this yet. So if you look
2888400	2893200	right here, as you'll notice, these, all these red marks, and then you'll notice right here,
2894000	2900080	it's because I do this all the time, all day long. I do this. I shove my feet in the ground,
2900080	2906640	I sit on my feet. So I have a perma, like little indent on my, my toe bone right here.
2907280	2913120	And then right here, yes, because I always do this and curl my feet up, my little, my little feet.
2914160	2922480	I'm a toe curler, smiggle, literally smiggling out here. But yeah, that's all the food I have to
2922480	2929280	review. But I maybe have some fun, cool things to show you. Do you want to see the ASMR that goes
2930320	2935840	like it goes bloop bloop bloop? Oh my god, I didn't want to show feet. Oh, I did it
2935840	2940960	stuff for free, like and subscribe, by the way. But yeah, like I go, it's so pretty. This is what's
2940960	2950000	blooping in your ear when I do all my ASMRs. Like I put the, I did this, I put this on your ears
2950640	2955440	as well. If I put this on your ears and go, I woke up still in bed. I love you,
2955440	2964000	mummy. Your nails are so pretty. Thank you. You like that? You like that? Oh, I had a ruler. So
2964000	2971280	you guys, if you guys have a ruler, I got a ruler so you can, you know, if you want to measure your
2971280	2980640	hand and you can see how my hand matches up to you, you know? So if your hand from here to here,
2980640	2986880	okay, is, oh god, you guys do inches, don't you? Oh no, I never thought this through. What the heck
2986880	2993520	is this? That's centimeters. Oh no, this is centimeters. Oh no, I didn't think this, this part
2993520	3003440	through. Okay, so what size is your hand in centimeters chat for no particular reason? What
3003440	3009600	size is your hand in centimeters? Just if you ever wanted to know.
3012240	3017200	What the heck is a centimeter? My pronouns are USA.
3019760	3027520	Google translate centimeter. Go, go, go. Someone says 6.5 centimeters for no particular reason.
3027600	3037280	Wait, 6.5. Hold on a minute. You're, if you're 6.5 centimeters, you're here. Okay, 6.5 is here
3037280	3049360	and it's my hand. Maybe it looks nicer. Someone says 10. If you're 10 centimeters, you're here.
3050320	3057440	If you're 10 centimeters, this is outrageous, truly. Oh, you've got such big hands. Why has
3057440	3063600	everyone got such big hands? Someone says 8.5, 8.5 is here. Man, you guys got massive hands.
3064400	3072080	The width of you, someone says 21. Yeah, right, 21. This entire ruler is 15 centimeters, so I doubt
3072080	3081120	you're freaking 21. That's, that's a, we're hit, we're hit with a, if you are, so this is 15 centimeters
3081120	3090000	long. So if you're 13, your hand, your hand is 13 centimeters. We're doing this. Okay, we're doing
3090000	3100880	this if your hand's 13 centimeters. This one's it. So yeah, that's absolutely awful. Right, right.
3103440	3112240	So here's zero and here's 10 centimeters. You already knew it was coming. Let's go. Look at that
3112240	3120880	manicure. Look at that manicure. Wow. So there's 10 right there. Look at my toe. Oh my god. I look
3120880	3132480	so feminine right now. Are those my toes? Are those my toes? What else do I have to show you?
3132480	3137360	That I'm mildly interesting. I might be doing more hand cam streams in the future.
3137600	3141840	Because look what I got. I got fake nails that look like me.
3143520	3149840	Wow, little straw nails. Oh, look at the things. These are like, oh, hold on,
3149840	3153680	hold on, aim bot. These are like little fake nails that you do this. You just put them on.
3153680	3159360	Look, I'm, oh my god, I'm strawing cuttles. She's eating with her feet. I've already ate,
3159360	3166880	mercy. I'll finish the tier rating. I'll quickly catch up. Make an acme, oh my god,
3166880	3174400	I get it now tier. I got lotion on my tentacle is baby, Ruth and Cheetos, hot. I mean, it's all
3174400	3178880	right. It's Nerds, A&W, Creaming Soda, Twinkie with the new logo and Mike Duds,
3179760	3189520	Milk Duds, pardon me. It's the biggest piece that is Dr Pepper. Kisses, Peeps, Twizzlers,
3189520	3194560	Pull & Peel, Jolly Ranchers, Hard Candy. That was overwhelming. And then cast it into the fires
3194640	3201040	of Mount Doom itself is Watermelon Catch Kids and Tacky's Fuego.
3203440	3206880	I'm sorry, that's my tier rating. I was like so freaking
3207920	3214320	thingy. I feel like Peeps is rated too high, but yeah, I'm gonna, if you don't like
3214320	3220640	hand cam streams, I'm sorry, but I just, I'm gonna fuck a little bit. And this is the part where you go,
3220640	3232240	ooh. But yeah. So, why else do I have that's even mildly interesting? Oh, I like collecting
3232240	3237520	seeds of many varieties. Would you like to see my seed collection? Oh, I don't mind showing some
3237520	3242880	of it. I've not added a lot of seeds recently because I've been so busy with work, but I like
3242880	3249120	collecting seeds. I think they're really cool. It's my seed collection. Though it's not finished
3249200	3253920	or labeled, I need to go back and label them all. But I have loads of seeds and I like collecting
3253920	3262160	seeds. You know, everyone's got a weird hobby. Mine's collecting seeds. But there you go. These are
3262160	3271760	all my seeds. And there we go. All these sample sizes of my seeds. I do have other bigger ones.
3271760	3277120	I don't grow plants because I have to rent, but one day maybe I will not have to rent and then I
3277120	3284160	can have my CDs. But those are my seeds. And they're all super cool. So the thing about seed
3284160	3289280	collecting is you have to make sure they're dry or else your specimen will actually mold because
3289280	3294320	if they don't dry, then they mold. And it's not good for obviously you don't want moldy samples.
3295680	3303440	But yeah, these are pepper seeds. And sorry it's not labeled. Australians call them capsicum,
3303440	3312880	but these are peppers. The British call them. Like again, I can tell that these are wild Irish
3312880	3323840	seeds just from I and I just collect seeds. I like them. You can see the difference in the
3323840	3328240	seeds as well. It's absolutely stunning seeing what nature provides. Because look in this jar,
3328240	3336800	for example, look how unbelievable. Do you see those dots? Those are entire seeds that grow into
3336800	3342240	big magnificent plants. And then compare them to the size of this seed. Isn't that amazing the
3342240	3351520	diversity of plant life? And the seed as well. Also, some seeds can be the vessel that they carry to
3351520	3357520	the next location for the plant to spawn. So you can get these are wind seed carriers.
3359280	3368480	Which is crazy because obviously in comparison, these are wind carriers. And then these aren't
3368480	3374240	wind carriers at all. They have to be taken away via animals such as birds. Like when birds feast
3374240	3377760	on berries and the seeds inside it and they swallow it and then they fly away and poop.
3377760	3383600	That's how the new plant emerges because there's no direct competition. Whereas if you get seeds
3383600	3388000	that have direct competition with one another, that's how you lower the odds of success. Like
3388000	3392720	honestly, it's beautiful and fascinating when you look into the world of seeds. And yeah,
3392720	3397040	I just think it's really cool. And you can get some that are so similar. See, these are both
3397040	3403120	wind carrier seeds. They both get carried by the wind. They look very similar, but there is a
3403120	3409920	differentiation between them. But flowers steal each other's thing. As they develop in, you know,
3409920	3419040	the rising of emergence, it's really fascinating stuff in my opinion. But it might not be that
3419040	3425680	interesting from a stream point of view. But yeah, these are my samples. So let me just put them back
3425680	3430800	on the shelf real quick. The fact that I actually picked one up doing that, I don't know if you can
3430800	3439040	see that. Wait, let's see, I picked one up. But yeah, those are my seed samples. I am planning on
3439040	3444560	getting a lot more, but it's currently winter in Australia, which means my samples are very limited.
3444560	3450800	I gather these naturally by going through spring or by going through walks and just doing that kind
3450800	3459440	of thing. Like, for example, on one of my walks, I got a chestnut. If you didn't know this is, you
3459440	3463680	know, those big chestnut or conkers, you might call these conkers if you're old school British.
3465360	3473760	But I also have bigger sample sizes as well in these, where I just took an entire sample of the
3473760	3479920	stem with the seed pods inside. I can actually take the sample out because my hands aren't too
3479920	3484880	sweaty. I'm not going to ruin the sample. Oh, it's not even going to come out. I don't want to break it
3484880	3494560	apart. Ah, well, those brown bits are the seed pod. And then you can see where the stem it grew from.
3495440	3502960	And you can actually see where the flower is budded. So if you didn't know, seeds don't form
3502960	3509920	until pollination occurs. And that's what flowers are for. It attracts insects to come to the flower
3509920	3518000	and merge the pollen and the stem. And it's absolutely fantastic stuff. It really is. And it
3518000	3524720	helps with plant variety and genetics. Like, and the fact that the seeds you can't tell, I've not
3524720	3531760	labelled this one yet, but I know what it is. This turns into a big, humongous red flower. And you
3531760	3537120	would never be able to guess that from the sample of the seed pods. So you have to break open these
3537120	3541920	seed pods in order to get access to them. These like little bits that you see coming off, those aren't
3541920	3548320	the seeds, those are the outside of the pod. But inside is the seed housed right now inside these.
3548320	3553120	So I'm not going to break those open when I put them into a sample jar, because I don't need to do that.
3554880	3561760	But yeah, that's one of my hobbies. So it looks like little buds. Yes, humongous. Well,
3561760	3568560	education. Did he talk me plants? Yes, the ovum. And, uh, goodness me, I've forgotten the name of
3568560	3575840	the stem. Oh, I've forgotten the name of it. But it's very important to have plant genetic variety,
3577440	3583520	which is why pollinators do such a fantastic job, such as bees, wasps. Yes, even wasps are
3583520	3592880	pollinators and tons of tiny little bugs, so many tiny little bugs. But to increase genetic diversity,
3592880	3600320	which gives resistance to plants perishing, that's why it's really good for all these little bugs to
3600320	3609520	mingle amongst all the flowers and all of that. Bats to pollinators? I didn't know that. But yeah,
3609520	3614000	I guess they can be. This is the doorbell hoax sector I'm talking about. It's just in my...
3615040	3620320	Well, none of the food section. We've still got an hour to ramble, but I'm not even prepared
3620320	3623600	anything else. I actually thought it would take a lot longer, but I kind of steamrolled that,
3623600	3629680	didn't I? I don't really have anything interesting to show. Oh, this was the toy that makes the ASMR
3629760	3637040	noise really good. But if I go like that against the ear...
3641200	3646400	You did speed and run at it. Yeah, fun nerd now over hobbies. Just keep rambling, please.
3649680	3658800	This is what... What could we put this as a substitute for? Huh? We wouldn't say this resembles
3658800	3667600	any body part. Would we... Take the... I actually don't have anything else interesting to show. I
3667600	3672320	showed everything at the start of the stream. I showed you the outfit I wanted to wear. I mean,
3672320	3678400	I could open it up if you want. I thought that... Oh, I should have hit there. Oh dear. I can't
3678400	3684080	believe it. I can't believe I'm not ginger. But yeah, this was the outfit I wanted to wear,
3684080	3689360	but then I realized I can't freaking do it because it's not the... Oh, we can even assemble it right now.
3695440	3703680	Come together. Yeah. There we go. See, there's one little cuttlefish ear. It's not a cat ear. I
3703680	3709360	don't want to hear any allegations that it's not cat ear. I'm with the Pintis. Exactly.
3709680	3717840	But yeah, if I can get it in. Oh, that won't fit. Oh no, the fabrics ruffled up.
3721760	3729600	Squishy cuttlefish plushy merch when? I don't know. Soon, maybe? If the U-Woo market sales go good,
3729600	3736080	soon. If they don't go so good, maybe not so soon. There's my cuttlefish ears. As you can see,
3736080	3741280	I'm shimmering like my pearlescent outfit. And then this is the bow for the bow.
3743040	3748480	As you can imagine, it doesn't really leave much to the imagined. I can't even figure out what way
3748480	3754640	this goes. Okay, that looks like I'm supposed to put... Yeah, so that's the front. And then that's
3754640	3761920	where I put my... Wait, is that the front? Oh. Oh, that's the front. Yeah. So as you can imagine,
3761920	3767840	there's a reason why I couldn't put this on today. But that doesn't mean we can't do it another time.
3767840	3780000	I'm just doing the buttons at the gravitational area. Just do that, and I'm gonna assemble the
3780000	3787840	costume. Yeah. Okay, so that's the bottom of it. And this bit goes around my neck. So it's like I'm
3787840	3793440	collared. And then this, what is this? This is just extra fabric. Is this for my feet?
3798640	3806080	Is this for my feet? This can be for hands. There's no hand. It is! Hold on.
3809840	3814240	You know what time it is. There's no way this is for my feet, but I think it is.
3818480	3825280	Oh. Oh, that's a terror. Oh, there's no way that's for my... Yeah, that can't be for my feet because
3825280	3832400	they ain't non-six. But that won't look like a massive rubber. That's awful. No, that can't be
3832400	3838400	for my feet. But what would it be for? It's a dead end. It's literally a dead end inside. I think
3838400	3844720	it is for my feet, but obviously it's just cheap quality. Because yeah, this is not... This is my
3844720	3851120	hand in it, no. Oh my god, it looks like the Gryffindor. It looks like the Sorting Heart from
3851120	3859360	Frickin' Harry Potter. I don't know. Well, you're not twice. I'm cutting eye out. Yeah. Okay, maybe
3859360	3865600	it was good that I tested it out. That was not gonna work. Oh, but then I have... Oh, maybe I knew
3865600	3870640	it wasn't gonna work. Oh my god, past me. You've done amazing because this is what the other thing was.
3870640	3874640	I was gonna try it. It's supposed to be
3875280	3880240	pearlescent, but I guess just the top is the pearlescent charm.
3882640	3887040	Sleathering. You would have done well. Sleathering. Hold on. Let me just...
3888240	3895200	My feet are sweaty, so it means stuff gets stuck to them, which is not very pleasant. Hold on.
3895600	3903760	Yeah. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Let me kick. Let me kick.
3906400	3908480	You can kind of see the toes done too.
3910880	3916800	I don't know. I can like see the bit that made out. I'm supposed to do like that probably.
3919040	3922960	Who said our god is an awesome god? Are we singing Gospels out here?
3925920	3934400	Okay, that's enough giddy-fitting. Giddy-fitting? That's not a word at all. I will do that another day
3934400	3939920	for this costume, although maybe it might not be a live stream and it might just have to be
3939920	3945840	pictures or something if you guys want to take a Donothon reward. I don't know. I still need to
3945840	3951680	figure out Donothon rewards. Azura is the first to have a Donothon at the other headquarters.
3952640	3958160	I need to help her coming up with some stuff because we're going to be doing lots of group
3958960	3968160	activities. Wait, I just thought that was her hand, but it was her foot. I thought I just
3968160	3979760	been on a glove now. Take me to church. Have I done... I have eaten all the American food.
3979760	3985680	I have nothing more interest in the show. Oh, maybe... Okay, so this was my concept that I had.
3986240	3992080	Give us a soul flash, but it would be so wrinkly because I have to like turn my foot up in order
3992080	4001760	to give you a soul flash. So this was my concept for an ASMR series, okay? So we could do it on
4002800	4007600	Pyro Pups. Well, I was going to do it on the girls mascots first if we managed to get plushies of
4008560	4014000	them. And it was going to be like this ASMRs for Pyro Pups only, for example. And it would be like
4014000	4021600	because Cinder is on fire because she's so hot type thing, I would get the microphone. So you'd
4021600	4027280	see the microphone. So like, hold on, I can literally give you a live example. So the microphone,
4027280	4031040	like it would be a hand cam type thing, but I wouldn't do it live. I would make like an actual
4031040	4035440	professional video out of it. And it would be like, so because Cinder's always hot, Pyro Pups need to
4035440	4041200	cool down because of how hot she makes them. So I would do like with a little spray bottle and I'd
4041200	4049040	go like ear to ear. And then like that was and then whatever was related to and like, I would say
4049040	4054400	some lore about Cinder like, oh, Cinder started streaming last year on this day. And since then,
4054400	4059440	like she's had this collection come out and she's been able to achieve this and she's done that. So
4059440	4064720	it'd be like ASMR for those who are in the fan base. And I teach you lore about the person. And
4064720	4069040	then like, I would relate to it as well and be like, because Pyro Pups are such good boys, they
4069040	4073280	also deserve head pat ASMR and like pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat, you know?
4074240	4080560	Like that. When did you do that? I've not done it, but this is my theory for like an ASMR type
4081520	4087920	series that I could do. And like, if a creator's come out with a plushie, so like again, this is
4087920	4093280	Darling Strobe's plushie. And I'd be like, oh, so Darling Strobe started her journey five years ago.
4094080	4100400	I think it was roughly five years ago. No, I don't think hers was as long. And like, I would just
4100400	4107760	tell Facts about the creator and I'll be like, oh, she's been making ASMR videos since 2021 or
4107760	4112400	something like that. And like, she's really found a good groove and she uploads like that kind of
4112400	4118800	thing. And then because Strobe's so cute, we would like, I would offer it a little strawberry and
4118800	4123280	then I would double over it and go yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. And then when I get the girls
4123280	4128640	plushies, I'll like all do like super maxed out. And then I can tell behind the scenes stuff about them.
4129600	4133520	And Mercy gave me permission to say this, but if I get the snippets plushie,
4134720	4139600	do you want to know what Mercy put on the end of her application that also helped strengthen
4139600	4144880	her application to Veiler? She put, I have autism and she went, she got in.
4145440	4152000	She put, I have autism. At the end of that application, it says, uh, is there anything you
4152000	4155280	want Veiler to know about you? And she goes, I have autism. And I was like, oh, and you come,
4155280	4159280	and you come. Gotta look after the fellow artists. So then she comes.
4162160	4166480	So yeah, please don't, uh, please don't think Veiler ain't gonna take a look at you because
4166480	4172880	you're autistic. Nah fam, the spearheads fucking got the combo of everything going on. So don't
4172880	4177280	you worry. Uh, but yeah, I was going to like do like a smart, that way everyone's plushies.
4177280	4183440	And then it also means if there's any creator that has a plushie that wants to send me it,
4183440	4189440	so I do like a, like a series on them as well. I'm more than open to it. I can get a PO box.
4189440	4194160	So if you are a creator without plushie that you can reach out, but obviously don't do it right
4194160	4197600	now because I'm not even started the fricking series. I was going to start the series off with
4197600	4201760	the girls plushies because like I would have to do like research on others. Obviously it's really
4201760	4206160	easy. I can just bomb the dns and be like, Hey, what do you want me to say? Uh, our type thing.
4206960	4213600	Um, whereas like for other creators like I have to do my research. Okay, I have to do my research.
4214560	4220640	And obviously like if it's she beats plushie, for example, this is the, this is the ASMR you're
4220640	4225040	getting right right on the, right on the face. I hope strobe doesn't jump in the stream. Oh my
4225040	4233600	goodness. She's going to be like, what are you doing to my plushie? Um, but yes, I can send you
4236080	4243040	but yes, um, I wanted to do it like really in character and all of that jazz. So I might do
4243040	4248720	a series like that. And I think the ASMR would be pretty Pog not going to lie. I think it would be
4249440	4257600	how one says a poke champ. Oh my gosh. I can't believe it. Darling strobes plushie knows how to
4257600	4269360	highland dance. Fogger is champed for years even. She's enjoying, I'm sure. Oh, well feel
4269680	4278640	strong and kill seas. Oh yeah. Not that kind of seed sample. Don't send that kind of seed sample.
4279440	4287200	That's a bio hazard for one. Did you know that swimmers can last up to 48 hours in the,
4288320	4298160	the womb? Which is why you need to be careful and wrap your willy. Don't be silly. You don't want
4298160	4304800	to pay child support. Don't give her the opportunity to leech your income. Be a child support. Don't be
4304800	4312160	silly. Wrap your willy. I'm just turning this into a mascot now. Well it's not my mascot, it's not
4312160	4332880	a re-film but. Was it a Mike and Ike? Just life advice, I know. Thank you for the message
4332880	4339120	plushie. I know Darling strobes plushie. I've completely forgotten. The fan base evades me,
4339120	4345440	the name of her fan base. Her darlings? Possibly? Very plausible, it could be her darlings.
4345440	4351520	But yeah, I know Senders is pyro pop. I could definitely do that series once we, oh my god,
4351520	4360080	what happens if they kissed? Oh this is boy slumber parties versus girl slumber parties.
4360080	4372640	I've not really been such a child. I've not like had a chance to actually play with toys
4372640	4378000	many a year. I'm sure that's not a surprise to anyone. But yeah, this is so cute and like
4378000	4383600	how much detail. Also, I didn't know this. When you order for makeshift, it literally tells you
4383600	4388960	like how lucky your batch is. Like Hellhound, I don't know if you can read that, hold on.
4389760	4394320	It says, oh hold on, where's camera? Hold on, find camera, find camera, come on, you can do it.
4394320	4403360	Hellhound, Wolf plushie by Cinder. Only 697 made, but it doesn't give me my number I don't think.
4404320	4412560	Just says it's official merch. Oh wait, what? Okay, they're called, if you're a darling strobe,
4412560	4422080	you are a Snickers? Like the bar? And you've only got 294. There's only 294 of these made and I have
4422080	4429360	one. So yeah, I was hoping to do an ASMR series like that. So it's kind of like ASMR and VTuber
4429360	4433200	orientated, which I thought was really cool because I don't think I've seen anyone do that before.
4433840	4447600	That's what her mascot is called, we're learning. But yes, I am hoping to be a cheeky cheeky and
4447600	4455280	possibly get the girl's plushies for their birthdays and then I can start up that series.
4455280	4461760	And it would be really cool because like I would literally open up a like form and other VTubers
4461760	4464880	if they wanted to be a part of the series, literally all they have to do is send me their
4464880	4470080	mascot, like a plushie of their mascot and I'll do the rest of the cooking. And I would think it
4470080	4475840	was like a cool way to get like more VTubers like involved and it's a way that I can kind of interact
4475840	4483920	with VTubers because I get like, not nervous, but I don't like reaching out because I'm a dirty dirty,
4483920	4489360	whereas I don't know if the girl is and I'd rather not like force that barrier. Like the barriers
4489360	4496080	being crossed between like Yumi Plus, like they're all super cool, honestly. Like I feel comfortable
4496080	4505200	with Yumi Plus and all that and the VNU girls, I'm all comfy because of all that jails. But yeah,
4505200	4508960	like I don't really want to reach out to creators in case they're like, I don't want to be associated
4508960	4518480	with you. Yeah, that's cool. I get it. I need mascot plushies and Fumos. What's Fumos?
4519440	4526240	Yumi Plus has been awesome so far. They have. They have. I would like the format and it would be
4526240	4532400	really cute. Yeah, like kind of like just like a little rundown on your mascot and all that jazz.
4534400	4545760	Just as a warning to the harem in T-minus 40 minutes, your supreme is live. Did you guys like
4545840	4553200	my hypnosis yesterday? Yeah. I didn't really expect to do any of that, but that was a very good
4553200	4558720	suggestion. I loved it. Oh, wait, sorry. Do you guys want to, if we're just talking, if we're just
4558720	4564640	talking, hold on. Let me just, if we're just talking away. Yes. Oh, yes. Kiss my feet.
4570960	4575600	You can literally see where I've been pushing in on my toe there. I do this all day, every day,
4575600	4583440	all day long. If I sit on my feet and all that jazz. Yes. This is my finished tier list. Let's
4583440	4588960	just, sorry, let me just point out the different sections of the, excuse me, excuse me, coming
4588960	4596480	through. So this right here, if you can point it correctly, so this is the S tier, which was
4597680	4604400	this is the A tier. Oh, no, it was Mike and I. Pardon me. Then the A tier, which is, I can't even
4604400	4610640	read my writing from here. Baby Ruth. And then the Cheerios, the Cheetos, not the Cheerios,
4610640	4618240	that's actually British food. And then for B tier, nerds. Do you guys, do you guys even have the
4618240	4624160	ability to do this with your feet or is this like, like, I literally have full ambidextory?
4624160	4629520	Like, I can literally have full ambidextory with my, my grippers.
4634800	4642480	Oh, shit. What happened? Oh, did something break? Oh, no, I didn't. I thought it did.
4642480	4647120	Okay, it's all good. Yeah, you can do that. Yeah. But can you write, hold on, wait,
4647120	4652400	can I write the refling's name? Hold on. Hold on. Let's see if I can write your names.
4653360	4657360	Well, I'm going to write refling, not your names in particular, but that could be a really funny
4657360	4664240	stream if you really wanted that. Hold on. Okay, it needs to be a bit longer. Hold on.
4664240	4668880	If you, if you weren't here at the start, the lady cut my toe so I actually don't have any,
4670960	4676320	a little harder than I thought. Right, R. Oh, that didn't even, oh, that's not even,
4677040	4678640	okay, there's the start.
4681360	4688160	And he used all my brain. Okay, hold on. It may actually be easier if I do this. Hold on. Hold
4688160	4691520	on. Hold on. I got this. Let me click. Let me click. I know you can't see the angle. Let me,
4691520	4696960	oh, it's not going down. This is terrible, honestly. Signed feet merch win, honestly.
4697680	4705200	Right. Oh, we're getting there. Oh, that's such a good R. I'm not even kidding.
4707280	4710960	Okay, that was an interesting E. That was an interesting E. Let him cook, let him cook.
4710960	4714880	Okay, that's the same problem with that E, but don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.
4716160	4723840	Don't worry. Up, up, and then down again. Yes, yes, and then an I.
4725920	4734960	And then up again, up again, gently, gently. And then an N. Okay, so down and then along. Okay, so
4735520	4741680	on the paper. Yep, and then up a little bit. Yep, and then along. Oh, and then down. Oh,
4743600	4750960	and then a G with all my might. Oh, and down. One big down, one big swoop, one big swoop.
4752000	4759520	There we go. Every flu. Oh, wait, we need to do the dot on the I. Hold on. Right about here.
4760400	4763360	Okay, there we go. Hey, replay.
4767040	4773600	I don't even know how I did that, honestly. Ta-da! Look, R-E-E. Wait, I didn't do the F on the...
4774160	4784240	That's about your name wrong. I did. That's about retelling. Wait, R-E-E-F. I forgot the F. Hold on,
4784240	4788080	I forgot the F. Let me try again. Let me try again. I was getting really distracted, but okay.
4788720	4795600	Okay, we need to just... Oh, hold on. Okay, hold on. You just hold that tight. Froggy likes that bad boy.
4795600	4802080	So do the F, and then it's got to be a flick at the back. And then, and... Oh, there we go. Oh!
4804480	4810160	Tell me that isn't like neat. I literally just drew cursive with my feet. Please clap, seriously.
4810160	4813920	I just drew cursive with my feet. Reefling. You can see that clear as day.
4814880	4822640	It is so good. Recovered F in the chat, which was right. I can't believe I did that. There we go.
4823200	4828240	That is amazing. I've got so much skill. I do. I've got so much skill in my little toes.
4830480	4839120	I was actually putting insert golf clap. Yes. But yes. That's me goofing around. That's all my
4839200	4845440	ideas. Oh, you can see my headset again. Oh my gosh, I am a real... I can't believe it. My immersion
4845440	4850560	is gone. It's out the window. I do not... I actually think for some reason my feet will probably be
4850560	4856160	better right in with my right foot instead of my left. I feel like if I wrote with my left foot,
4856160	4860160	you wouldn't actually be able to see any... Oh, I just dropped the pencil. Hold on. I'm just gonna
4860160	4868240	pick it up with my toes because I'm so... See, this is left foot right, and I'm not sure it's gonna work.
4869920	4875840	Oh, no, it's not gonna... Uh-oh. I don't see. No, you're not even gonna be able to see it.
4877520	4882400	Oh, jeez. No, that actually hurts to write on the left foot for some reason.
4883440	4888560	There, that's my R on my left. It's so good. If you can do this, what else can you do?
4890480	4895200	I don't know. Where's the ruler? Hold on. Where's the ruler? Where'd it go? Oh, there's a
4895280	4905760	sample here. Let me take a little sample at why not. These are called bendies. These are...
4907040	4912000	They actually use hook seat technology. I think there's four ways of seat dispersal,
4912880	4916720	and these bendies are called hook. They hook to the fur of the animal who's been near the plant.
4917520	4924560	Uh, don't be afraid to... Don't be afraid to focus in on the seed. Come on.
4926400	4931600	Oh, well, I try. They've got little hooks on them. It's pretty impressive, honestly.
4932960	4938000	Anyway, that's just me and my obsession with the seeds. What about you? What's your weird collection?
4940000	4945680	Look at the mess I've made. There's just chaos on this desk, right? I'm not even kidding. Let me just...
4947360	4958160	Like a huckleberry. Write in a feet script with feet as well. What, you want me to type on the
4958160	4965040	keyboard next? I mean, I could. You guys are going to see my gamer keyboard. You want to see my
4965040	4970080	gamer keyboard? It lights up. Hold on. Let me put the book on the floor. Our tier list is out the window.
4970640	4977200	Uh, excuse me, Giro. I'm afraid due to the nature of the medical emergency, you're gonna have to go up there.
4977920	4984080	Oh, no. Is the wire pulling? Okay, what do you want me to type in chat? I don't think... I can't
4984080	4988480	pull the wire any further, I don't think, and I can't really remove the webcam because of the way I've
4988480	4995760	set this up. Okay, what do you want me to type in chat? I've literally have chat open. What do you
4995760	5003760	want me to type? You want me to type PogChamp, right? Okay. Oh, I missed. Hold on. I think I'm
5003760	5021440	missing everything. Oh, shit. That did not work at all. That did not work at all. I thought I nailed
5021440	5030240	that. I'm not gonna lie. I thought I nailed that. I did not at all nail that. Like, not even close.
5030960	5038880	Not even close. Okay, give me another word that's short to try. I'll like really try hard it, okay?
5039840	5046080	The gripper. Literally, oh, you can't see it, but I like do this on the end of the table.
5046400	5052560	What do you want? You want cuttles, right? Really try hard. Okay, I can't even see it. Okay.
5057120	5059920	I can tell I'm like inputting so much other stuff.
5063760	5070560	Did that work? Did I miss? I did it! I freaking did it! Let's go, baby.
5076800	5080160	Just like that. Honestly, give yourself some practice on something new. If you've never
5080160	5084720	typed with your toes before, all it takes is a second chance and you nail it, apparently.
5086080	5091680	Oh, yeah. This is my keyboard and this is my mouse mat. Can you tell who's on the mouse mat based
5091680	5100800	on the hair? I ain't clean it, but it's, it's Jinx from, from the hit TV show, Arcade,
5101760	5107120	or League of Legends if you play League, but I like Jinx. It is Jinx. God, you guys are really
5107120	5113520	good at that. What the heck? No, I don't think there's anything else I can show really. Yeah,
5113520	5121200	maybe although, you know, look, look, it's the, the thingy. This is, so I bought the technology
5121200	5127600	that lets me do all this, but I never use any of it because I'm a bad VTuber. I'm a naughty VTuber.
5131600	5134560	This is what I'm supposed to do like mid-game. I'm supposed to be like,
5135120	5140240	let me change real quick, but yeah, it's not happening with me. Sorry, but I ain't not good,
5140240	5146000	but this is like how I control my hypnosis. So have you never seen like the behind the scenes
5146000	5150720	on a VTuber? This is what it looks like. This is what I'm supposed to do, but I never do it.
5153360	5159840	I've got a bikini toggle. Well, let's not do that. Oh, that's a tipper. I will hold you in
5159840	5163840	my hand. What did you say? Is Brian talking? I don't think Brian's talking right now.
5166000	5173120	There's no Brian in the stream. I don't know why. Oh, oh, I missed another tip from a random
5173120	5178960	refling, some random refling tip that said, I heart feet, narrow tip. Thank you for the tip,
5178960	5183920	said feet dexterity level 100. Just unlocked literally a little bit of a, but yeah, if you've
5183920	5188720	never like seen the behind the scenes of a VTuber before, like I'm happy to show like, I don't
5188720	5194800	mind. Like, you know how I always complain about calibration? This is why, this is why I calibrate
5194800	5201040	to and like, there's my spit pile. Look, this is very spit out all my stuff. Look, there's my half
5201040	5208000	chewed up foods, half twizzler. That's the caramel one. That's my peep. Yeah. And then that's James.
5208000	5215360	Hi, James. Hi, hi. But yeah, I don't really mind showing the behind the scenes of it.
5215920	5223120	It's just, just what it is. I don't bother me. No. So yeah, this is when I'm taken. I'm like, oh,
5223120	5231360	yeah. Oh, yeah, I took that. So good. Oh, my freaking, my preview of my live stream just died.
5231360	5240160	And I thought I just died, but I didn't. Indirect kiss on the food. Do we have the same desk? I
5240160	5247520	built this desk myself. I needed a really wide streaming desk and it costs like $400 to get it.
5247520	5253760	So I bought wood and I painted it and then I attached legs. So it's an extra wide desk. It's
5253760	5263520	like super wide, super wide, super wide. This is literally just turning into a handcam stream,
5263520	5266880	right? What game, what game we playing? You know the streamers that like only show their hands?
5266960	5277600	Oh, also, let's play also. Oh, oh, oh, let's get it. Actually, you paint wood, that could look
5278560	5283680	but yeah, she could build as furniture with a perfect way she'd be
5285760	5288240	playing the Binding of Isaac. Oh, my gosh, should we?
5291200	5295360	Yeah, maybe, maybe I should maybe not make the focus on the keyboard of this stream.
5295360	5299520	You know, let me just move that back over there. You go over there. There you go.
5300560	5306400	Oh, it's bumping on something. It's not. Oh, I broke the legs on this keyboard.
5309920	5315360	Do you feel in? See, funny you mentioned in a full Elden Ring placer with feet. I was actually
5315360	5319760	going to do a foot cam stream to show how much I don't have my feet on the ground. I'm currently
5319840	5326640	sitting on my feet yet again. And I thought it would be funny to play a game where I show feet,
5326640	5330640	because like when I get stressed, my feet also go like that with my toes. Like I have a lot of
5330640	5341680	emotion in my feet. Maybe. Oh, I do have something to show you. I can do this. It's a special shoutout.
5341680	5347760	I'm allowed to do it. So the artist is, I can't freaking, I need my glasses on so badly right
5348240	5356400	now, is LinkedIn Art. And I can also say this before anyone cries. I also say special thank you
5356400	5364880	to Dapper Bucket who commissioned the artwork. But for next week's streams, I have Elden Roll,
5364880	5371600	Elden Roll, nice enough. No, I have Elder Scrolls, Skyrim part one and part two. There's
5371600	5375840	are two back-to-back endurance streams for full achievements. We're going to get them together.
5375840	5379920	Hopefully I can do it on Xbox Game Pass and then we can get our first 1000-gamer score.
5381280	5386880	If not, then we'll play Vanilla. Then we have our classic ASMR stream which will be short.
5387520	5396800	And then we have the first indulge gen-mate stream. All six of us are going to be on Power
5396800	5402080	Watch Simulator and there's going to be a little plot line to go along with it, okay? You're not
5402080	5407840	ready for what that plot line is. But there'll be a reason why we're playing that game as our first
5408960	5416560	gen-mate thing. And then I am jumping back on Old School Runescape to beg you guys to give me
5416560	5424960	fish again. And then we're playing Crash Bandicoot Warped which is an old childhood game. I only
5424960	5430240	remember playing the China Mission when you're a cocoa and you ride the tiger. I used to play
5430240	5435840	over and over again. And I actually don't remember finishing the game or what it's about. I just
5435840	5442160	remember cocoa. So we're going to be playing that. And then Buckshot Roulette is my tiny, tiny stream.
5442160	5450080	I am aware that Buckshot Roulette is a very short game. So I might just do a foot cam stream if my
5450080	5456080	toes look good, if they don't. When are we getting a cavio play through? Not yet, but soon to end.
5457040	5463760	But yes, there are three Endurance streams which are the Elden Rings and Old School Runescape.
5463760	5467840	Crash Bandicoot, I believe, can be finished in eight hours. So it's technically not an
5467840	5475760	Endurance. That's just the average Joe's work shift. So Buckshot Roulette can be pretty fun if
5475760	5483440	you go for high scores. Okay, I've never played before. Someone says Veeler running out of funds
5483440	5488080	in the first month so the girls banded together to open a sexy power wash car company. You know what?
5488800	5492320	If you're just going to guess what the freaking plot was that I was going to make,
5492960	5500000	at least don't guess it correctly. You've ruined it now. You've ruined the collab. How dare you?
5501040	5505840	The whole point of that collab and the reason I picked that game first, I was going to start the
5505840	5510880	game with all of them lined up and I was going to be so serious. And I was going to be like,
5511520	5516640	look guys, the income that Veeler are making is not looking good. We're going to have to open up a
5516640	5521840	side business and we're going to call ourselves like the e-girl washers or something like that.
5521840	5526080	If you're going to guess it, don't you brand it. You brand the whole reason we're going to play that
5526080	5533920	game. How dare you? How dare you? How dare you? But only the reeflings that are in here are going
5533920	5539280	to know you're only you guys are going to know. You're going to know the secrets. But yeah, Buckshot
5539360	5543840	Roulette is going to be teeny tiny. I might add feet cam just to spice it up a bit and you guys
5543840	5549840	can tell me off every time I sit on my feet as I currently sit on my feet. Crash Bandicoot,
5549840	5556000	eight hour old school, endurance 12-ish roughly. My voice can keep up. Power wash, super short.
5556000	5562960	I don't know if I'll do a pop-up stream. It's plausible. It's very plausible. I might do a
5562960	5568160	pop-up short stream. I don't, I'm not going to ask for more than two hours from the girls
5568640	5574160	collab wise. I don't want to like force them to, you know, do that kind of stuff because they're
5574160	5581280	probably a busy one to do their own thing. Keep your feet on the ground. Literally, I can't help
5581280	5586240	it. Look how red my feet get. I don't know if you can tell but they're all red here because I've been
5587280	5593920	like doing that again. I can't, oh, oh, oh wow. Okay. All right. Just got a little sensor thing
5593920	5597760	going on that it do excuse me. Hold on a minute. Just, oh yeah. Yeah, you like that.
5599840	5600960	Look at that. Empty. It's true.
5605600	5612800	We love the story. There's a bandaid on one of them because unfortunately the nice lady that
5612800	5619520	was working on my feet cut it open by accident. If you didn't know, when they prepare your toes,
5619520	5625520	they literally take out these clippy caliber things and clip away the skin around your toe
5625520	5631760	and I started bleeding. So I said, it's okay, don't worry, but please don't do anything to it.
5631760	5636640	There's no point in putting this on it whilst I'm bleeding out. So I just said do, no, everything
5636640	5642320	else. It's fine. It's fine. Oh, it's terrifying. Well, I've heard some horror stories about people
5642320	5650160	like freaking losing their feet because of like chop, chop. So I'm probably not going to get this
5650160	5656480	done often. I do have what's called gel on it. If anyone is so inclined to know what this is called,
5656480	5663120	these are called gel and she literally baked my fingers. She put them under a UV light. So if I
5663120	5670640	get like any skin issues, it's because she baked my freaking fingers like to activate the gel.
5670640	5675120	You're supposed to go back to the place to get it removed, but I think I'm just going to grow it
5675120	5680800	out because I don't want any more chemicals like it was the smell of the chemicals that they were
5680800	5688560	using on my nails was very, it was rather pungent. It was rather pungent and I really do not
5690000	5694240	feel like any more chemicals after eating all those American sweets. I do apologize. I've had
5694240	5699760	enough chemicals for one day or for one week. So I'm just going to grow these out naturally. It's
5699760	5705520	probably going to look really bad. Oh, I've got 10 out of 10. Don't remove the gel at home. It's very
5705520	5709680	dangerous. Yeah, I was just going to let them grow out and cut it off. I assume it's fine to
5710720	5714160	let it grow out and cut it off because I'm not really going to be doing. Hopefully I'll get
5714160	5719440	monetization soon because the whole point of me getting this was to do a monetization stream
5720880	5726320	that's similar to this, but a bit different. That's right. I thought ahead enough to make it
5726320	5730720	similar, but different. Oh wait, similar, but different.
5733840	5739680	But yes, I love this. Are you squiddin' me right now? Oh, I heard that. Love all the streams
5739680	5746720	so far. So glad you're back. You and all your gen mates are on point. 10 tenths. I heard that.
5746720	5754240	Did you guys hear that as well? You did. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Eternity. What a name.
5755200	5762800	Eternity. Thank you for such kind words. Yeah, me and my gen mates are amazing. Oh,
5762800	5767360	also, this is how I make jokes. Right, someone quickly give me a joke that I can steal. Quick,
5767360	5772880	quick, quick, because this is what I do when I steal your jokes. Okay? That's what I do when I
5772880	5778800	steal your jokes. Brian's back. We did miss Brian, but thank you very much for the tip again,
5778800	5787840	Eternity. Eternity. A man walked into a bar. You think he would have seen it?
5790160	5790960	Wait, did that play?
5794000	5794880	Wait, it didn't play?
5795840	5811360	Okay, I don't think it's working right now. Something's not quite right. Something's not quite
5811360	5820240	set up. I'm not sure why. Okay, just imagine this one goes, and then this one, if it's a good joke,
5820240	5828320	then this one, if it's a bad joke, and then this one, if crickets. Okay? I don't know why. Sometimes
5828320	5832720	something's working. Sometimes other times it doesn't work. Oh, sugar. I'm going to make sure
5832720	5838880	I'm redirecting into Sheevee. Oh my god. Oh my god, you can see me typing. Oh my god, wait, hold on.
5839520	5846320	Is it cool? Like when you can see streamers' hands. Hello, reflings. How, oh, I'm getting embarrassed.
5846720	5857920	Is it going? And then that's right. I'm taping and streaming live. What are you going to do about it?
5858880	5859440	Nothing.
5863200	5865440	No, not really.
5869040	5878000	You're so silly. You're so goofy. Oh, that was right. You're so goofy. Are you challenging me?
5879840	5885920	I don't know how you learn how to tape in school, but in primary school, you had to do this. Like,
5885920	5891280	at first as a child, you do this, but then they teach you, like each hand takes over a certain
5891280	5897920	section, so you're just like, blah, blah, blah. Do you watch keyboard when typing? Right, this is me
5897920	5904320	not looking. The only way I can prove it is by looking up with my Vtuber model. Like, oh, okay.
5904320	5909600	Let me just get the star position. I am, oh, I pressed caps lock. Sorry. Wait, no, I didn't. Hold
5909680	5919440	on. Sorry. Sorry. I am not looking at the keyboard right now, but that's because I'm a dirty, dirty
5919440	5928240	neat that never left the house for two years. So I am kind of used to typing a lot. Sorry,
5928240	5934080	but it's just the truth. Oh, wait, I spelled the truth wrong. Wait, wait. There we go.
5934560	5944000	Yeah. Yeah, so I can tape without having to look. I don't know what it looks like, probably.
5945360	5951840	She's just like me. My gran always gets amazed whenever I tape in front of her without having
5951840	5957600	to look. She's like, hey, do you do that, strongy? I'm just like, I don't know. We grew up with
5957600	5961840	technology. You grew up with like coal fires. That's like as far as your technology went,
5961840	5967440	a little coal fire in the corner of the house. Main or grammar mistake. I went, no,
5968480	5972960	do a taping restream. Wait, I can beast you guys and taping?
5976080	5980160	How do I do a taping restream? Is there like a website for it? I was going to do, I was going
5980160	5994800	to verse you guys in chess. Like 1v1 me and chess. 10 fast fingers. All right, I'll check it out.
5996000	6001360	10 fast fingers. You should be taping up the dev overkill. It's hilarious. Wait, chess would be
6001360	6006000	so cool. Yeah, it would be a chill stream, a long stream, snipe day. I would love to 1v1 you guys
6006000	6015440	in chess. Before you're like, are you a chess champion? Oh, no, I am not. I suck.
6018480	6020560	But I also swallow.
6028320	6030640	But yeah, we probably 1v1 in chess would be funny.
6031360	6039840	I literally, I am a chess box champion. Right, let me 100% make sure I'm raiding into
6039840	6047840	sheepsters after this stream because I am rubbish and I'll mess it up. Hold on.
6050320	6056720	Come on, YouTube. Give me monetization so I can do my pop-up stream. I'm waiting for it.
6057680	6069920	Oh, she's playing vampire of masquerade bloodline. I might need to sit and count for that stream
6069920	6077040	on ironically. I'm doing collab study. I'm actually doing collab scripts. I keep saying, oh, I'm gonna
6077040	6087520	do collab scripts, collab scripts, collab scripts. And then I never do them because I get distracted.
6087520	6091840	It took, and oh, there's like literally food on the back of my hand right now. Oh my god,
6091840	6095920	and I knew you told me, how embarrassing, there's just food on the back of my freaking hand. Do
6095920	6099280	you like my, do you like my meat sticks? Do you like how you can see my meat sticks?
6100160	6104400	Some people hate that, but I don't know, it's just like, can you see your meat sticks at home?
6104640	6108800	YouTube, please. I want to use that most honestly. I want to use them too. I've got my
6108800	6113840	most waiting for that meat stick. What are they called? These aren't the ligaments, what are they
6113840	6120080	called? What are they called? What if I'm freaking name the tendons and the ligaments? Yeah, those
6120080	6127120	are my meat sticks. So hot. You like meat sticks? One potato, two potato, three potato, four.
6127760	6132400	Right, I have still not correctly redirected into she because you guys are distracting me.
6132400	6136560	Stop distracting me. This is terrible. I'm just going to start talking through my hands.
6136560	6141920	Stop distracting me. You're so naughty. Stop it. That's your end point. You're in,
6142640	6146800	getting closer to you. I'm getting so, you can see the chocolate on my finger again.
6148560	6158480	And there, this isn't even, get off me. Yes, you're right there. You're a terrible influence.
6159040	6161040	Terrible.
6165440	6172240	Did you lick my finger? Refling, you just lick my finger. You're terrible.
6174640	6178640	But yeah, this, this is my hand. I do apologize to those who,
6178640	6182480	get filler, get filler, get filler. Don't enjoy when a YouTuber has hands, but
6183120	6188640	I don't know what to tell you. Like I also got the, got the feet toes up. Look at that spread. Look
6188640	6195760	at that spread. Why does, why does that toe, my pinky toe does not come out very much.
6196800	6206560	Spread. Whoa, my pinky toe. Hold on a minute. Whoa. Wait, wait, why does my pinky toe not spread?
6208000	6211280	Whoa, wait, when I go to spread my toes, my pinky doesn't.
6212240	6214400	Ah, it like so crooked.
6215520	6220240	There you go. I, I must ask you a question.
6223200	6227760	Why is this one like having the time of its life over here? Holy crap.
6229040	6233440	Could you imagine the grip strength I would have on you? Where's the ruler?
6234320	6238320	I'll repeat my, imagine the grip strength. I'll snap it in half in between these toes.
6242240	6245760	What does that even mean? I don't know. I'm starting to lose the plot. I think the,
6245760	6253360	the American can die is getting to me. It's all, it's all the red numbers. It's the red 40.
6253360	6262240	It's going, it's getting to my head. I can't stand it. I'm being taken over. Oh, who say can, who say.
6265840	6269760	Red 40 strikes again. I can't believe it. I'm turning American.
6270640	6274880	I'm like leaving you. I can't believe I actually thought this was a, um,
6276160	6280800	a fortune teller thing. I was convinced there was going to be like a joke on the other side or
6280800	6286640	something. You're going crazy. I like, I can't believe it. All it took was a few American sweeties
6286640	6292960	and I'm going, the numbers. What do they mean? Right. I don't know. I don't know what you guys
6292960	6297520	want me to do for like these last 10 minutes. I feel, I feel a bit out of my comfort zone,
6297520	6302320	but not in a bad way. Just in a, I'm really unprepared. Like I thought we were going to be
6302320	6305520	at this for a very long time, but we're not. Do you want me to tell you what? I'll just,
6305520	6313520	I'll just caress this. There you go. Oh, little ASMR orb. Watch to do your orb, orb. I see. Yes,
6313520	6318800	yes. I'll just caress it. Oh wait, maybe I should get the second one so it's a bit more,
6319760	6330080	a bit more. Yes, we'll caress these. One week review of the company. You want me to review
6330080	6335520	via lure? How do I review it? Everyone's doing great. They're all having fun. I'm going to even
6335520	6341040	review it. Everything's going fine. We've got an exciting thing coming up, but I'm not allowed to
6341040	6348800	talk about it. Boom. But you know, God respect the, God respect the hustle. Spur the moment ASMR.
6349760	6355920	Employee performance report. Bro, what do you want me to say? Oh yes, all the girls literally
6355920	6360080	streamed every single day. What more could I ask for? Seriously? What more could I have asked for?
6361920	6368240	Visucky coming up. All right. Okay. You want the DLC expansion of Veila already? The Visucky DLC
6368240	6378480	to go live? Okay. Not enough burps, honestly. Lord's milk. Nice keyboard. Thanks. Thanks. Oh my
6378480	6390800	God. Wait, I can still type in chat. Thank you for being so kind about my keyboard. You're so nice.
6391200	6401520	Woo. I'm a real, I'm a real streamer. Totally not breaking a VTuber code of conduct.
6402080	6408640	I was at VTuber code of conduct 101. Don't show that you, do you see this little mark here?
6410000	6417440	That was from the toothbrush when we brushed our teeth on stream. All of the toothpaste leaked
6417440	6423680	down my toothbrush. Do you want to brush our teeth? Let's, let's brush our teeth. Oh my gosh,
6423680	6428080	that's like the perfect time to do it. Hold on. We need to go brush our teeth. We're helping.
6448240	6455600	All right. People are wondering why I mute when I leave the room. It's because the toilet is right
6455600	6459920	there and I really don't want to hear, like, I don't want to give you a chance to hear me,
6461120	6468000	like, do a big old, a big old job. I am not going to lie. I actually had a tick to hear you as a part
6468000	6472720	of this stream. And obviously the Americans have been bubbling up and help out. I'm currently using
6472720	6479440	my floor towel and I have a floor towel for how sweaty my feet are. Oh, has everyone got their
6479440	6488640	make tootie brush? Look, this is my tootie brush. It's so, so fancy. Oh, so fancy. I don't put it
6488640	6494480	on because it makes a really loud noise and I don't want your perspective to be, what we try and do
6494560	6498640	this thing together. I'm going to need to borrow your toothbrush. Okay.
6502160	6508080	Okay. Does it vibrate? Yeah, I like it vibrate. It's like, oh, that just put water everywhere. That
6508080	6513920	was very, oh, oh, rather silly of me about how, so I have to snap it in to put my thing into,
6513920	6518320	but we're just going to manually brush our teeth. Okay. So this is day two of 21, even though I've
6518320	6535360	not done it consistently. I'm brushing away the red 40. Red 40 ain't got nothing on me.
6535360	6547200	Oh, I forgot about the moment. This thing just keeps on getting fired. What do you mean? I've
6547200	6557120	been sweet and then I get, I have done. You need to get behind your teeth as well, like behind your
6557120	6566800	front teeth and behind your broken front teeth. Just after this stream, I don't want to get up. Okay,
6566800	6575040	even though after this move. Oh, yeah. We're brushing our teeth right here. Sing gangsters'
6575040	6589440	parodies. I don't actually know the words that well.
6589760	6603840	Okay, I've gotten wet everywhere.
6604640	6616640	What's your favorite American song? Something from Green Day, probably.
6619200	6626240	Uh, I like the schizophrenia Green Day song. I can't remember how it goes.
6626560	6638720	I like the holiday. What would the schizophrenia one be? He's in the scene as well, as opposed to a
6638720	6654960	scene as well. One, two, one, go! Lay down your arms, and through the sky, one, two, one, go!
6654960	6659360	Oh, there's a new single out by Atadashi Gakko. Wait, hold on, I need to spit.
6662640	6670240	This is my sweaty feet towel. Would you like it? Instead, it's gonna be my toothbrush. Oh,
6670240	6675040	shit, that just went everywhere, don't it? Oh, that wasn't the objective, but hey,
6675040	6682720	oh, it's like all over me as well. I have so much spit. I don't know if you guys like salivate a
6682720	6689840	lot. Oh, it's on my desk. Oh, sorry. Oh, thankfully the camera's actually out of my hairs in the way,
6690560	6694960	so you don't have to look at my freaking spit on the desk, clean, twat bag. Oh, well, here you go.
6695680	6703520	Oh, yes, oh, yes, the hood reads in the first place for the... Oh, it's all over the back of
6703520	6709120	my hand as well. My god, that really actually got everywhere. Jesus. Some of us salivate a lot,
6709200	6713520	some of us don't. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. It's even on the keyboard, is it?
6715360	6721760	It actually is as well. I'm sorry. I get really salivated whenever something enters my mouth,
6721760	6730560	so teeth brushing with something. I've actually covered that other thing, actually. I'm sorry.
6730560	6735600	I just have to use my sleeve. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know I'm gross and minging, okay?
6736160	6739040	Look, deodorant's optional. If I'm not going outside, I'm not wearing it.
6741840	6745520	Oh, I should probably do that smelly thing, because all my gen mates did that smelly thing.
6746320	6753600	Okay, we are soon to read into ShoeBee in two minus seven minutes. Cease your heresy.
6755120	6763840	Would be disgusted. Look, I was raised in a barn. That's all I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
6763840	6768000	Hear that chat? She's self lubricating. Oh, you can't say that. You made me read that out loud.
6769840	6778560	The AFK bubble. Yeah, you like my AFK bubble? Any AFK? Yeah, give filler, give filler, give...
6780640	6782320	In a barn, is she, Jesus?
6782320	6784320	She's...
6789680	6796320	I feel like I don't have anything else interesting to show. Like, this is it. I'm not that interesting.
6796320	6803200	I'm sorry. Okay, out of raw interest and no more. Where's my pencil? I've already lost it.
6804160	6810400	Excuse me. You're gonna have to move out the way. Okay. How many?
6812480	6816240	Right. What are... Right, this is four centimeters.
6818000	6827360	Four centimeters. Okay, then we'll do the next one. This is eight centimeters for no... Oh,
6827360	6832080	you guys can't see that. Sorry, sorry. I keep forgetting the camera's like, not my eyeballs.
6832080	6836800	I know that's crazy, but the camera's not my eyeballs. This is eight centimeters long.
6837760	6845040	Oh man, I think... This is 12. This is 12. That's ridiculous. I don't know why I'm...
6847760	6851760	That's 12. Oh, you can't see it. It's so freaking late.
6853440	6862720	Yeah. How many pickles can you show? What's she measuring? 16.5. That's all fours.
6863680	6866160	You guys are not out here for that much, holy shit.
6868480	6878880	16.5? Shut up. I'm sorry. What? That can't be. This... This ruler is 15. I'm sorry,
6878880	6889120	I refuse to believe that. What? No way. My reflins are packing. I mean, actually, hold on.
6889600	6893440	I don't know. The marshmallow's beg to differ.
6895120	6903200	19-0-5. No, I don't believe yours. I don't believe yours. That's outrageous. That is so much blood
6903200	6916560	flow. Like... I don't... That's... I'm still going. Like, I'm still going. There's no way. I refuse.
6916560	6924720	17! No. I'm... I'm still going. I'm claiming like a monkey with hands. There's no way. I refuse.
6925840	6932960	You guys cannot be that packed. How does that work? Don't you know, like, get lightheaded or something?
6934960	6936240	That is outrageous.
6939200	6945520	No. Why are we measuring our hands like this? Wink, wink. We're measuring our hands.
6947520	6948320	Like that.
6956640	6962160	How do you do this? 14. That seems more reasonable, but that's still a bit outrageous. I have to admit.
6964960	6968800	14 is that. That is still really...
6968800	6977520	I don't know. Hold on. I'll redo 12. I'll redo 12 so we can actually see it because I can't actually see
6977520	6986160	that with my eyeballs. Oh, why? What? Why did that not show up? I wonder because of the green undertone.
6986320	7000160	Hmm. Yeah. My goodness. Now convert that all into inches. I don't know what any of this means in inches.
7004480	7007920	So I love to hear you pronounce different words with your accent.
7008560	7015920	Apparently I say dual wield quite satisfactorily and strawberry is quite satisfactory and ghetto.
7016160	7028080	This girl. 2.5 centimeters is one inch. So two point... All right, hold on. Do it like this.
7028080	7033120	Do it like this. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Let me kick. Let me kick. So from here,
7034320	7042960	one inch, 2.5 so then that makes that two inches. 2.5. So that's three. That's two. That's one.
7043920	7050800	What does that mean? Five and then plus two is ten. It's four inches. Yeah. And then we'll
7050800	7056880	halfway. That's five. Then we'll halfway again. That's six.
7059440	7064080	Yeah, I'd say you're, you're, woohoo. Let's go. Woohoo.
7064240	7071280	You're good to go. You start. This is, this is getting painful. This is getting,
7072400	7077280	we've had enough at this stage. I will, I will teach you a very fun fact. Maybe a later date.
7079280	7088400	But as a woman, I had to go see a woman doctor and I got diagnosed with a clam. Okay, let's just call
7088400	7103520	it Tate Clam Syndrome. Okay. So this, woohoo. This, this is, oh, oh, you're hurting me. Like,
7103680	7116640	so, yeah, this is, so higher than this. Our lure. Yeah, I'll get to go.
7127120	7131120	Yeah. I mean, I don't mind. I think if we end up doing bands,
7131600	7142560	streams, I'm happy to show you my, my figurines and I will show you why I have a certain type of
7142560	7150400	figurine from a super underground elite video game that no one's heard of. Okay. And I'll,
7150400	7157360	I'll show you why I have a certain type of figurine and I'll explain it in a lot more detail.
7157360	7162160	But apparently, none other than Shibi Cottonbump has just gone live. So we're going to end it there.
7162160	7166800	Are we happy? Are we satisfied with the hand cam? Have I done enough fan services? Everyone happy?
7166800	7170000	Do you have any last requests? Any last requests before I go?
7174080	7182000	Remember a game. Yes. Today is trying to stream we learned. Yeah. Ending on a high note. It was fun.
7182000	7186880	Yeah. Everyone happy. Thank you for stream. Okay. I did everything. I did everything. No
7186880	7191360	requests. Okay. I'm happy. Everyone happy. Peace sign and stick out your tongues model.
7192960	7201920	I can do that. Flip me off. Yeah, you like that? See, some people, some people bring this in.
7201920	7210720	Wrong. This is wrong. It's, it's back to back L's. Okay. You need, you need to give them the L back
7210720	7216160	to back. That's how you do it. Okay. You want hand holding? How do I hold your hand?
7220400	7225520	I hold it like this. If I ever see you at a convention, it's over. This is how I'm holding
7225520	7230000	your hand. Oh, or like this because apparently you guys are absolutely humongous. So I'm just
7230000	7233040	going to hold onto your thumb. Do you just be walking around the convention?
7233040	7248560	I don't know. Got you. End with a heart. I'm, some do that, but then the fingers in the
7248560	7255600	background are in the way. So I'm, I'm all in like this. Okay. I'm all in some do this. Like it's
7255600	7260080	supposed to be the love heart from the bomb. I don't know if you can tell, but this is supposed
7260080	7263200	to be the bottom of the heart. And then it goes like, Oh, well, I ran out of room there, but you
7263200	7271200	get the point. Is there any other way of hearts? Do your middle finger if you really wanted.
7272320	7275120	I'm starting to make stars and stuff up in the touch.
7280400	7284720	Wait, that's a heart sign. This is a heart sign. It's the bottom of the heart here. So it's supposed
7284800	7287920	to be like bottom of heart and then tee tee. That's a heart sign.
7290400	7296640	You can do the hand heart. I do feel, I feel, full stack. I think there's another way to do it,
7296640	7306000	but I actually don't know. I did feel stack. I thought the thumb and the finger made the heart.
7306880	7312640	Like that? What? Like that? The thumb and the finger make the heart?
7313600	7317520	Well, no, you guys are learning how my brain is slow. It's not looking good.
7321280	7328720	But yeah. Isn't it because the two tips of the fingers form a heart? What? What are you smoking?
7329280	7332960	We've made a, we've made a, we've made a diamond.
7335120	7340880	No, the one you said was a bomb. Oh, wait, this is the love heart part. And then it like crosses
7340880	7347840	over obviously because that's how fingers work. Huh. Interlocked fingers. Yeah, you like that?
7348560	7356560	Yeah, they really do it for you. Like Flappy Bird. Oh, wait, what's that thing where
7357440	7362960	you do that and then spin it? What? Wait, hold on. I'm sure there's a thing where you spin it.
7362960	7367200	Oh, there it is. Diddy, diddy, diddy, diddy. You used to have a thing where it was like,
7367200	7374080	oh, it's a boy. Diddy, diddy, diddy. I can't remember. Can you do a shadow pop it?
7376320	7378000	Oh, wait, dogs have two eyes.
7378320	7388800	Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
7391520	7398000	Scuff dog. How else are you supposed to do it? Very big underbate. Look, he's a, he's a pug. Oh,
7398000	7399680	wait. Oh, no, that's what a dog looks like.
7400640	7403520	Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
7406720	7410400	Someone says, you're Australian chat, bro, you're about to be redirected in the
7410400	7416240	sheebie yeti-like. Yamest it. Hand shadow stream. I don't know. How would I do a rabbit?
7416240	7421120	So those are the ears. Where's its face? I don't know, how does its face feel like?
7421120	7433200	Wait. That's too hard. This is too hard for my brain. Okay, I am going to let you raid into
7434160	7439840	sheebie's pantalones. I've had a really fun hand cam stream. That's the first time I've
7439840	7443360	ever done something like this. I hope you enjoyed it too. And if I get monetized,
7443360	7450000	then you will begin something similar, not the same. Similar, not, not the same.
7451280	7457360	Similar. Okay. Similar. Yeah, you're like, I got my nails done. Did you see? You notice
7457920	7464880	it's showing off my nails? Got them dead. Okay, you loved it. Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed it. I didn't
7464880	7468880	know what to do, honestly. I was like, I don't really know what you guys want. Like,
7468880	7473120	we'll review these sweets. And now I have tons of sweets that I don't like. Do you think I could
7473120	7476560	send them to the girls and pretend that they're a cure package, but really I just don't want to
7476640	7484640	eat anything? Okay, that was so fun. Thank you so much. I'll see you all tomorrow for
7490160	7495920	oh wait, it's Elden Ring for Foostroda. And I'll teach you all the strats on how to get 100%
7495920	7500720	achievement playthrough. Whoa, is that as bad for you as it is for me when I see the preview?
7500720	7507120	My hand, like, just teleported. But I hope you enjoy my French tips. You know,
7507120	7517520	a ha ha, wee wee baguette for my, oh wait, hold on. French tips. Yeah. Thanks to the stream,
7517520	7522720	Elden Ring. That keeps saying Elden Ring. It's not Elden Ring yet. Elden Ring is the motor. No,
7522720	7527520	next week. It's Elden Scrolls. I keep getting Elden Ring and Scrolls messed up right now.
7527520	7532880	Yeah, these are French tip nails. That's what these, this is the style. They paint the white
7532880	7539120	on it, but it's like my natural nail color and everything. It's called French tip. You know why?
7541520	7546000	Because I'm French and I'm giving you the tip the night, boys. Right, enough, enough.
7546000	7549760	Sheeby's live. Please enjoy Sheeby to your heart's content. Thank you so much for watching me rate
7549760	7555440	American sweeties. Where the heck did that come from? That just flew out of nowhere. I got afraid.
7555440	7560240	I thought it was a spider. Thank you so, so much for stream. I will stop rambling because I'm
7560240	7564160	holding you up. I'm holding the line of command. Please enjoy Sheeby to all your might. I will
7564160	7569120	see you tomorrow for two endurance back-to-back streams. So get ready to strap in. If not,
7569120	7571840	I will get strapped on. See you tomorrow.
