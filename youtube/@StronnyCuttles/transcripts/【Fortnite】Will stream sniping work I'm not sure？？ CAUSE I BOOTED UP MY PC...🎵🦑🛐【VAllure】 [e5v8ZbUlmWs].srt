1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,200
We got our number 1 victory royale, yeah, for tonight we're about to get down, get down!

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,800
Hot as a dead air, they're burnin' up to me all town.

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,800
Oh, the voice!

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
Why is it always Fortnite?

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
I don't wanna think of Fortnite.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Okay.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:37,800
Um, Roy, right, I've left my heart rate monitor on, cause why not?

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:51,800
Why don't you, why don't you, why don't you, try finger, that's all.

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,800
True.

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,800
I'm so sorry during the collab I couldn't read, but now I can read you with my beautiful

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
eyes.

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,080
Thank you, Jo, Bo, Nogo, Strony's husband, love the name.

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,120
For the extended membership, hope you have fun, Strony.

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,600
I'd recommend taking Resilience and Kindred for additional perks.

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,280
Maybe swap the first one with Hope, but it's your choice.

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,200
I'm so sorry, I wish I read that, but, like, we got there in the end.

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,680
Zara Zane, thank you for the extended membership, Surviving and Krilling with the Kriller Tiger

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
Gremlin.

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,680
Grr!

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,680
A letteration in that one, thank you for the extended membership.

21
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,680
Uh, did I miss anything else?

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,400
Chris Albain, thank you for the membership!

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,800
We did unlock a new emote slot, so I just added what I had on my PC, so there's no, these

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:46,280
are temporary emote holders, okay, they're, they're just you puking for one and you praying

25
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,280
as well for another.

26
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:56,560
So there's technically a positive refilling emote, but yeah, em, right, so how it works,

27
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:10,800
I have, and we're gonna play Team Rumble, okay, and if you want to come into my game,

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,480
it's like, oh god, I've already forgot, em, I've put the code to Strony, all lowercase,

29
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm actually gonna pin it right in there in the chat, it's like, in order to find me,

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,080
it's just lowercase Strony, I was gonna do Team Rumble because I have no idea how many

31
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:35,640
refillings there stream stipend, cause, you know, em, two permanent, oh it's no, so if

32
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,680
you come into my lobby, it will, it should put you here with me for, and then whoever

33
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,280
else gets, I don't know, I don't know, if there's, honestly if there's three stream

34
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,560
stipend refillings, then we've got the squad, we might as well just do fours, but I'm rubbish,

35
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,920
I, I'm, I'm not the biggest familiarity, but yeah, we're gonna, I was gonna do Team

36
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:09,720
Rumble, cause she had many of you there are, but yeah, fell no fell, oh my god, I've forgotten

37
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,080
the code thing, it's like a code where you insert where you wanna, like, who you wanna

38
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:25,800
play with, a moat, yeah, I'm just gonna randomly a moat, is that too loud, you enter the code

39
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:34,080
by scrolling down on the play screen, play, scrolling, oh, custom key, okay yeah, put,

40
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,760
so go play, and then scroll down to custom key, and then put strong in a lower case,

41
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,280
the custom matchmaking key forces matchmaking services to only match against others of the

42
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:52,600
same key, this is used for private tournaments or other custom game types, okay, I don't

43
00:03:52,600 --> 00:04:00,000
know if you use it, you'll fill up my lobby or not though, I don't know, can anyone confirm

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,320
if they're trying to stream snipe or not, if not, you're watching me play the worst

45
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:12,000
Fortnite gameplay ever, I think we all just match, wait, so like, what, when I hit play

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,520
it'll fill you in, it'll just put us in the same game, okay, if everyone who wants to

47
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:32,360
stream snipe has the code in, we'll hit play and see what happens, if there's like a limited

48
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,840
amount of refunds, we'll just like, I'll just pass you around and keep using them and use

49
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:46,880
the next refund in line, and then next one, assuming you're in any region, I know, we're

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:56,080
on earth, do I set my region, oh no, don't look, don't look, don't see that I'm strong

51
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:04,920
in cuttles, um, recent cut, I had to like lower all my sentence cos I was like, oh,

52
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:15,640
I'm doing so good, um, users, assuming we're not the ones using it, yeah, no, I'm coming,

53
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,240
I'm ready, okay, I'll wait until if everyone says they're ready, I'll hit play and you

54
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,160
should come in, I just want to say before anyone gets mad, I have muted the in-game

55
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:31,800
voice chat just in case because I didn't want any issues and I really enjoy stream sniping

56
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:39,560
and I don't want it to get ruined, so, I'm putting in preventative measures just in case,

57
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:58,760
um, sentence, third from the wheel, what, wait, why are you telling me sentence, oh, where's

58
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:07,920
my sentence, what's that, settings, third from the left little cog wheel, what about it, what

59
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:21,120
happens, matchmaking region, oh, oh, where are we going, where are we dropping, doesn't matter

60
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,800
what region, select which server you wish to connect, servers that are closer to you would

61
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,200
generally have better, it all picks a server with the best connection, wait, that actually

62
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:36,640
have to pick, we're going to Brazil, I hope not, where are we picking, east, central or west,

63
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:44,120
or does it, I don't think it matters, I don't think it matters either, because you use code

64
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:52,720
strongy in the play section, use code strongy, for 10% off game resups, um, thank you, I got

65
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,960
excited because I remembered that part, if everyone has it set to all, it shouldn't matter,

66
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,200
okay, we're not going to touch the matchmaking region, so, again, play and then scroll down

67
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:11,520
and then custom key, strongy, lowercase, is everyone satisfied, because I'm going to hit play

68
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:19,440
and they'll be like five years, game resups, use code strongy for 10% off game resups,

69
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,640
link in the description below, and I get all the air names that they give, or if you don't

70
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,480
like me, but you like one of my gen mates, you can use their first name, either emmy, ac,

71
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,240
meracy, azura, shidi, any, any of those codes, apollo, hi apollo, how are you doing,

72
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:44,000
oh my gosh, apollo, what are you up to, you goofy goober, hang around, lurking around,

73
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,360
where's the link again, in the description below, as if you guys are teaching me how

74
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:57,120
to get streamer, honestly, I had to search team rumble, it doesn't appear, no, I think,

75
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,720
right, fuck it, we're going to do it, I don't know if it's going to work, if it,

76
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,880
waiting for matchmaking to come in, me praying it's going to be a reekland lobby,

77
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,800
no, are you joking, the one game type I want to play,

78
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:27,520
if I do battle royale, right, I want to be a foreman, and if everyone picks strongy in the

79
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,760
code thing, so you're streaming and wanting to see how you play fortnite, it's my favourite game,

80
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:37,920
oh no, I'm trying to play with the reeklands, but I'm setting it up so badly, I don't, I don't know

81
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
if I'm that good, I don't know if I can live up to your expectations, apollo, I'm going to be honest,

82
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,400
but I'll try my best, okay apollo is an avid fortnite player, I didn't see, I'm learning,

83
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:55,760
I love learning things, yeah that was an error, right, I'm going to do ranked off squad fill,

84
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:04,000
okay, and everyone's using the lowercase strongy, lowercase is pinned, okay, surely I will get

85
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,880
reflings, surely this is how I get reflings, maybe I should turn on voice comms so we can

86
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:17,760
actually try hard, sorry, I'm kind of tempted to, oh wait no why did that, oh damn it, oh dang it, how,

87
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,160
now I could put push to top on, push to top and then go to my setting, wait,

88
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:39,280
wait, what, why did I keep getting an arrow pulled, it's literally the default player thing,

89
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,920
what, can you trust them in the game, same thing I get, is it because we've put my

90
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:56,400
bowie, like on mental, they need to remove this, but I want reflings, that can't be right, no,

91
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:04,800
that can't be right, sorry, but what are you even on about, custom key, except,

92
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:16,800
don't you upset me fortnite, team fill, fill, ranked off squad, please, the most default battle

93
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,560
rumble it offers,

94
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,880
the queue is full, what do you mean the queue is full,

95
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,760
what do you mean, I need that muted if I've not got refing, um, wait, do I need a battle pass

96
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,960
in order to get in that, what, maybe because you're only allowed to play with bots till you get level

97
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:53,600
10, you, wait, is that real, I swear, is the game gonna make me play against freaking bots

98
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:00,320
until it is not real, I don't think so, wait, I'm gonna try, right, hold on, sorry, but you

99
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,120
can't use custom matchmaking for this game mode, what am I doing that's custom,

100
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:14,160
um, get that shit out of my face, what am I doing that's custom, let me know,

101
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,160
in order to use a custom key, you would have to be a fortnite career, are you

102
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:35,920
bitch, I swear, I swear, wait, but I want to play with you guys, so how do I get you in my lobby,

103
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,520
how do I get you in my lobby,

104
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:51,520
oh, no, I didn't know I had to level up, oh my god, right, let's go wreck some bots,

105
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,960
I don't know how long it takes to gain like levels in this game,

106
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,720
no, wait, time for a fortnite career, all right, time to watch, this is how obviously the first

107
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,560
fortnite game is gonna be a solo victory royale, yeah fortnite, we bout to get down

108
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,480
I'm just on the road right now and just touch down to main or pan, go on quest, track a category,

109
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,920
oh, shit, can I level up faster, wait, hold on, hold on, right, let's do one,

110
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,960
let's do one map and then we'll go back to the old, what the heck is going on,

111
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,880
because I don't know what is going on, I almost joked on my cup of tea, but it's okay,

112
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,480
no, no, no, no, no, don't say it's a bot match, say it's real, so I get my ego inflated, okay,

113
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,000
say it's real, so I get my ego pressed M in game to go to map and quest,

114
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,800
how is there a quest in the middle of a battle royale, that's really funny,

115
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,120
we'll have fun, gonna miss it because of bedtime, rest well, I'm so sorry,

122
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:46,880
I'm so sorry, my framerate is dying, I don't know why, no, I'm getting bullied by the game,

129
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,920
as if this PC is struggling, I'm sorry, this is a beast of a PC, I don't accept,

130
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,440
I don't accept that, it's genuinely having issues, okay,

131
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,200

00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:28,880
I can hear, how do I get up, oh god, how do you build, what is it, okay, there we go,

136
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,440
I'm, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, if I'm getting stream sniped, I'm the easiest

142
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,200

143
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:33,680
I'll have to, good luck to everyone, I've got to learn to crawl, right, if it's just bots then

144
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:42,480
like there's no point in trying to play to, this game has fall damage, I just destroyed 50% of my HP,

145
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:50,160

147
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,800
it shouldn't, this PC's a beast, Fortnite presentation, I know there's enemies there,

148
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,600
what is, why are you struggling, rendering modes, like which low level mode to use,

149
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:16,400
low graphical fidelity, what the fuck, how, everything's low, what did I do, my PC's

150
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,080
struggling, what is your GPU, a beast, turn off v-sync, where the fuck is v-sync,

151
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,400

152
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,800

155
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:56,640
oh that's just good, can't sprint, low energy,

156
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,440

157
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,120
god, bandages take a while, don't they,

158
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,840
I don't know what's going on with that, how did you not die,

159
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:34,800
I'm totally not against bots right now, why is something making noise, are they shooting,

160
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:45,040
I don't, a fight not made, here, over,

161
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,120
someone's shooting, I know I'm moving away from the zone, but literally if I'm against bots,

162
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm not, I'm not holding back, sorry, I didn't need to hold back against bots,

163
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,120
literally, oh my god the frames please, I'm actually gonna try and win,

164
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,920

165
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:20,480

166
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,160

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,400
let's go, yes against real, I'm totally against real people, oh my god I'm dolphin diving,

169
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,680
so I need a med kit to go above 70 for a plant on hell,

170
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:03,920

172
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:22,240
yep absolutely, no no botage due to my low level at all, no bots aren't even a thing in this game

173
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,640
if you didn't know that the AI was so advanced that it actually destroyed itself because they

174
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:39,280
realised that human players are just so much better, if I can't seem to get you guys to stream

175
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,040
snipe I'm just gonna straight up add yous and then delete yous at the end of stream and I will show

176
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,760
the evidence of deleting everyone so no one has any brain worms please don't worry if you do get

177
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:58,560
brain worms as that's life okay and but I will, oh my god there's an apple and

178
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:10,640
why is it always above cut like literally, yeah didn't think and AI was based off of

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,440
Stony's gameplay that's why they're so strong literally like let's go across the bridge to the

244
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:37,680
the lady was so nice like she was asking me like oh what brings you in and I was like I've noticed

00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,840
that I can't really see signs in the distance anymore when I used to and she's like oh no that

246
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,880

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:54,160
have an eye issue please don't hesitate to go to an optometrist or whatever the thing is because um

overrun sounds like there's someone over here

593
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:41,880
see a lot of fighting in the distance

594
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:57,240
I don't need to be faster just to do that I wouldn't mind the gun for it I don't

595
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:09,680

01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:20,000

597
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:27,840
okay so I can see when my allies shoot next to me as well because that's what I'm

598
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,840
getting confused about

599
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,840

602
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,800
I think okay I'm gonna say something controversial I think we're still

603
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:04,960
against bots I think we're still against bots and I'm freaking out over bots I'm not gonna lie

604
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:11,600
it's a little bit controversial I know but I'm so low on ammo and nothing's hitting that guy was

605
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:16,560
a paid actor she checked the shop later I'm not gonna buy anything from the shop

622
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:46,360
you get mentioned if this is our last bot lobby we better make it count because

623
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:55,880
now are you speeding up faster than the car if you want if you know

624

629
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:39,320
like everything the cars like what did you even get that I don't even know what

630
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:46,400
we did there just loot starts falling from the sky the boats are locking onto my location

631
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:57,360
but where what the heck is that it's like a little drum I have to come down fire oh that

632
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:05,880
looks like my parallel isn't the other one that you did how do you do that I'm shaking

635
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,000
My friend.

636
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Oh, the zone.

637
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Oopsies.

638
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,000
The zone over here.

639
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I'm doing it.

640
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I'm doing it.

641
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,000
I'm doing it.

642
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Are they on their own?

643
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Not that I can tell.

644
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
The zone.

645
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
We must go.

646
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
I'm one man.

647
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Hi, everyone.

648
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Hi, both of you.

649
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
That car is so low.

650
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
I will forbid all cars to be afraid by people, you know.

651
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
No, you hit me with your car.

652
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I'm troubled.

653
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
I don't have fish.

654
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I leveled up for drinking a potion.

655
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
She's doing it.

656
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Oh, I see them.

657
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
I see them.

658
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
They're like ants on the distance.

659
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
What is this?

660
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,000
A game for ants?

661
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
With all the ear cleaning,

662
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
it doesn't look like your ears are clear enough to look at the chest.

663
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I knew to them they...

664
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Well, I played it when it first came out,

665
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
because everyone was going nuts over it.

666
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:09,000
But I've never played it since.

667
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
But all the locations are like...

668
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I don't recognise any of this place.

669
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Now you know, mummy, you can level up from drinking,

670
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
start drinking some water.

671
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
No!

672
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Um...

673
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Oh, really?

674
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I should drink a bit more though.

675
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Alright, hold on. Let me drink some water,

676
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
since we're going against bots.

677
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
But next game, we're tryharding.

678
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,000
I mean, we're tryharding anyway.

679
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
What's going on?

680
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,000
You protected me to make sure I don't get shot.

681
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Alright, we...

682
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Seems to be fine.

683
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Alright, let's go kill some bots.

684
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
The map is really redone once a year.

685
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Tryharding in kids' games is more likely than anything.

686
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Just don't land on Tilted Terrors.

687
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Is it even a thing anymore?

688
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
I remember when Tilted Terrors got deleted,

689
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
or something happened,

690
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
and everyone was like,

691
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
No, Tilted Ter...

692
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Well, that's kind of cool though.

693
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
That's kind of...

694
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
I don't know, that's kind of cool.

695
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Isn't there not enemies here though?

696
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Oh my god, look at that aim.

697
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Bruh!

698
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Okay, that's embarrassing.

699
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Sorry, hold on, hold on, hold on.

700
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Let me just...

701
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Oh, I need a reload.

702
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
It's one in the chamber.

703
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Okay, it doesn't matter.

704
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I need a refling gum.

705
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I just killed the entire squad,

706
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
and you were so lurking.

707
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
But yeah,

708
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
if this is an easy-to-access stream snip game,

709
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I don't know.

710
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
I'm kind of licking it so far.

711
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I'll say that as soon as we go against actual real...

712
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Scissors, you need to drink this.

713
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
When we go against actual...

714
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Like, people, and we're getting demolished,

715
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I bet you'll change my chin,

716
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
but because we're playing against bolts to level up my account right now,

717
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I bet you'll be like, absolutely reading enemies.

718
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I'll bring it to him.

719
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Maybe real people could make this more stressful.

720
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Well, I think once you're stressed,

721
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
like, oh my god, we might actually win,

722
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
might make it really exciting for me as well.

723
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Real people are mad good even at level levels.

724
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
It's crazy.

725
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Oh no.

726
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,000
And before, like, I have to restart lobbies

727
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
because we don't even get a chance to play,

728
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
so there's no point in counting it as a round together

729
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
without going again.

730
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Uh...

731
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
He's checking it in that place,

732
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
but it doesn't seem to be an indication of an enemy.

733
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Unless...

734
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
What is he doing in there?

735
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Things are exploding and all that.

736
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Is it safe?

737
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Or is there actually an enemy?

738
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
A warthog?

739
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
He's shitting out a container.

740
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Are they trolling me?

741
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I'm believing.

742
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I'm believing there's something here.

743
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Oh my god, I can't believe the reflin

744
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
just told me to go back into the kitchen.

745
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
That's really shit over here.

746
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
What?

747
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Get in the car?

748
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Cyberpunk.

749
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
What? I'm to drive?

750
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Now, hold on.

751
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Right, I'm not to drive.

752
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Okay.

753
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Drive?

754
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Um...

755
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
There's a truck.

756
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
You want me to drive it?

757
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Drive it?

758
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Wait.

759
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
I don't know.

760
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I can't be right.

761
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Right, I shouldn't, so you should get out.

762
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Right, I can't be right.

763
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Okay, you drive.

764
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Right, and then let me in.

765
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Oh, or let me on the back, I guess.

766
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I actually look like a belong to him.

767
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Jack didn't expect...

768
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Jack Sparrow just drank too much.

769
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
When we're going to get to like 34,

770
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Nick's just going to forget about you.

771
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Oh, I've actually cancelled the chess stream tonight.

772
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Practice.

773
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
All right, no, it's not cancelled it.

774
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
We're doing it at a later date.

775
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I'm just not...

776
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Why didn't we do this?

777
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Mount Olympus?

778
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I don't mind if I...

779
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Mount Olympus.

780
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Why are you taking us out of the zone?

781
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
You're stressing me.

782
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Oh, we've both got cars now.

783
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I've got to play dodge-ums with my beef tongue.

784
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
I'm trying to do a hit-and-run, please, for some...

785
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
...an enemy up the hill.

786
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
The Cybertruck looks so...

787
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Did I just see an enemy?

788
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Wait, someone's shooting over here.

789
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Hold on.

790
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I'm back up is coming.

791
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
I'll save you even though I suck at this game.

792
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
I'm helping, I'm helping.

793
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
I promise I'm helping sometimes.

794
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Okay.

795
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Wait, what?

796
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Is that an NPC?

797
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Ah!

798
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
That kind of looks like an NPC to me.

799
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Wait, why can't we see the red?

800
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
We can see his...

801
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Uh, uh, I need to help the replay.

802
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Oh, I can't build.

803
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Okay, this is no build mode.

804
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Okay, I just have to manually get up.

805
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
I can do that.

806
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
I can help the replay.

807
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
I just need to figure out how to use the stairs.

808
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Give me a second.

809
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Honestly, there must be so many, like, tactical positions...

810
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Where it's like, oh my god, I don't know what to do.

811
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
There's lots of noises.

812
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
I don't...

813
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
What the?

814
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
What?

815
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
How can I see enemies like that?

816
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
There's so much shit going on!

817
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
No, up, up!

818
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Where?

819
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Oh my god, is that a bear snake in the water?

820
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Aha!

821
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
I don't mind if I do!

822
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Where are all these shit coming from?

823
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Bruh, I can't get up!

824
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Oh my god, wait, the zone?

825
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
How are we supposed to get up?

826
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Question mark!

827
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Should we go that way?

828
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,000
We can't build our way out of situations like this!

829
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
The magnet on my head.

830
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Okay, let's beat up some bots and then we can play against real players and then I'll get angry.

831
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
You wouldn't like when mummies rage in, would you?

832
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
And before I get knocked by bots, I wouldn't put it past me.

833
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Oh my god, my aim's clear.

834
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Bruh!

835
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Bruh, I'm like trying...

836
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
I'm like trying to predict the aim angle and it's failing me, really.

837
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Whose ultimate is that?

838
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
I like it.

839
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Hold on, I need to reload.

840
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Is there a blue assault rifle or anything better?

841
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Are you moaning on them?

842
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Okay, let's get up the hill before the zone kills us versus the bots killing us, okay?

843
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Sure, I'll pick a rare assault rifle.

844
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
To the high ground!

845
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Literally...

846
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Because we're...

847
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,000
I imagine if we lost in a bot match just because we were so silly and forgot the zone.

848
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Now's the time to experiment with a weird weapon.

849
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I like sticking to the regular schmigal stuff.

850
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
I actually see who's left.

851
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Apparently there's four left.

852
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Where?

853
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
I don't see anything.

854
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
What, are they like to the left?

855
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
They must be.

856
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
We can't even all be.

857
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
They must be on the other side of the mountain.

858
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
You just shot a weeping?

859
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Oh no, he's on his own up there!

860
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
I can't help, I don't have an angle!

861
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Oh no, I don't have an angle to save my rib leg!

862
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Hold on, I'm trying to get to the sniper point.

863
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Oh, they're not at the edge.

864
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I'll help!

865
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
I'm helping, I'm helping!

866
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Oh my god, prank them forties with a bot!

867
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Hold on, I've got them.

868
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Stop hurting my rib leg!

869
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Stop it!

870
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Okay, we did it!

871
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
I know it's false, but we did it!

872
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Okay, that was...

873
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
GG's Johnny!

874
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
GG's!

875
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
GG's!

876
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Oh my god, wait, oh no!

877
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
GG's!

878
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Oh, how am I supposed to stay in the freaking bush?

879
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
We did it!

880
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
So, do not wreck...

881
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Do not go against the chikmo fumblings

882
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
and the reckoning of the radical reeflings plus scissors.

883
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Okay, return to lobby.

884
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Okay, and then I'll delete,

885
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
and then we'll do team number three,

886
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
and we'll keep her gone.

887
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
And then I'll name the team.

888
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I don't know what to name the team.

889
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
I'll see.

890
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Reclaim.

891
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
And then...

892
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,000
leave, part, team.

893
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,000
And then, one by one, remove friend.

894
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Then, more options.

895
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Remove friend, yes.

896
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
And then, more options.

897
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Remove friend, yes.

898
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
And then, reeflings, add,

899
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
and...

900
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
what are our names?

901
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Who's not played yet?

902
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Let's try this.

903
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
And then I'll add you.

904
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Whoa, no, that doesn't look right.

905
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
That looks right, though.

906
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Okay, let's read your names.

907
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Get up on...

908
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Then, let's do...

909
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
you.

910
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Three and four.

911
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Oh, there's quite a few of you.

912
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
I'm gonna hope that...

913
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
that one.

914
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
And then...

915
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
this is our team.

916
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
So, let's just say we're there.

917
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
And then we're in.

918
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Oh, you have the hypnosis thing as well?

919
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Was it free, or did you have to pay for that?

920
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Mm.

921
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Not plus scissors?

922
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Okay, that's really funny, though.

923
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
That's actually funny.

924
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Okay, so, our team is...

925
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Garabond, Diddy, and Slice Seabourg.

926
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
What would that call this?

927
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
What do your names give?

928
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,000
S-G-S-D...

929
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,000
D-S...

930
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Giz...

931
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Gidiz...

932
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Gidiz.

933
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Could it be Gidiz?

934
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Okay, Gidiz it is.

935
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
G-E-D-H-E.

936
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
So, it's spelled like...

937
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
It's spelled like this.

938
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
G-E-D-H-E.

939
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Okay, that's it.

940
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Oh, sorry.

941
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Okay, I'm gonna unpin the channel thingy.

942
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Okay, so...

943
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Adding as friends...

944
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Uh...

945
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Diddy and Slice need to ready up.

946
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Okay, adding as friends,

947
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
then removing between rank.

948
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Good luck!

949
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
And then I'll just pin that, so when someone comes in,

950
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
they can be like, oh, I know how the method is going.

951
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
And it's just random.

952
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Okay, random.

953
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Okay.

954
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Finding a match.

955
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Wait, the hypnosis doesn't work on the Peter Griffin one.

956
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
It's like completely bugged out.

957
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Oh my god!

958
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Whose dance is that?

959
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
I've recognized whoever dance that was.

960
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Oh, look, it works now!

961
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Damn, they really did a lot since the last time I watched Fortnite.

962
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Damn, they really did a lot since the last time I watched Fortnite.

963
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Yeah, they have like insane amount of collaborations.

964
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Yeah, they have like insane amount of collaborations.

965
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
He's got an M&M skin.

966
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Oh, it is M&M!

967
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Wait, M&M's in Fortnite?

968
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
I wouldn't even guess that.

969
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
It's rather odd coupling,

970
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
but then again...

971
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Vela in Fortnite 1?

972
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Yeah.

973
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
It's the number one victory royale.

974
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
No way.

975
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
I should have played it M&M instead of Dice Barrel.

976
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Oh, I hit the good A.

977
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
A.

978
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Wipe it out.

979
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Wipe it out.

980
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Oh my god, the dances are so cute in this game.

981
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Oh my god, the dances are so cute in this game.

982
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Like, they look so satisfying.

983
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
He's rolling around on a grape.

984
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
He's rolling around on a grape.

985
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
What does it mean?

986
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Grape, to be honest.

987
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
What's your favorite hypnosis?

988
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Yes, Master.

989
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Is this a real lobby or is it still bought?

990
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Is this a real lobby or is it still bought?

991
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
It looks like a real lobby.

992
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
I don't know.

993
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
I don't know how to mo...

994
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
How do you mo?

995
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
I have no idea.

996
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I'm hitting all the buttons.

997
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Something's gonna pop off this.

998
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Oh!

999
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Beat it and mo!

1000
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

1001
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Let's go to classy court.

1002
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Let's go to classy court.

1003
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Because we're going to get sued.

1004
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
We're going to get sued.

1005
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Wait, we're fuzzling?

1006
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Wait, no! Reefling!

1007
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
You... you... you...

1008
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Okay, we're going here.

1009
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
You put down your marker and I got confused.

1010
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
You put down your marker and I got confused.

1011
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Reefling, you confused...

1012
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
You confuzzled me.

1013
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
You put down your button.

1014
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I mean, I guess.

1015
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
How do I mo in real life?

1016
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
You do a little dance.

1017
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
A little...

1018
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Alright, when do we go?

1019
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Are we against real people now?

1020
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Or not yet?

1021
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
I don't know how the lobbies work.

1022
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Wait, where am I going?

1023
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Well...

1024
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I really hope you're not a real person.

1025
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
I really hope you're not a real person.

1026
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Please don't...

1027
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Please don't be a real person.

1028
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
I need that gun. I'm sorry.

1029
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Please don't be a real person.

1030
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
No more.

1031
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Oh my god, stop.

1032
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I think there's real people now.

1033
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Oh my god! Oh my god, are you real?

1034
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
BLEET!

1035
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
I think there's real people.

1036
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
I'm just picking up everything.

1037
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
There's somebody here.

1038
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
What's going on?

1039
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Oh my god, am I against real people now?

1040
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Okay.

1041
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
It doesn't make sense that only two of them would drop down.

1042
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
I don't trust...

1043
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
What's this? Oh, that's the ink.

1044
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Okay, Reflings, I can ink on you momentarily

1045
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
if you can name a moment.

1046
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
What's that?

1047
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
That's a assault rifle?

1048
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Yeah, I want a assault rifle.

1049
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Reflings!

1050
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Reflings, I need you all to group up with me

1051
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
so I can ink all over you.

1052
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
I don't know if that worked.

1053
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Okay, I'll put one, two.

1054
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Where's other Reflings?

1055
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Wait.

1056
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Other Reflings? Oh, he's coming over!

1057
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Is he flying?

1058
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
How are you going so fast?

1059
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Is he in a car?

1060
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Reflings, is he coming from the sky?

1061
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
How are you even up there?

1062
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Reflings, get down, that's dangerous!

1063
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Okay.

1064
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Okay, time for mommy to ink on you.

1065
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
We're done! Yay!

1066
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
We heard inkling

1067
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
and he literally came flying.

1068
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Okay.

1069
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Okay, we're all healed up.

1070
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
That's what we like to see.

1071
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
We did it! We did it!

1072
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Oh, I'm jumping that extra high as well.

1073
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Let's go!

1074
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
That was fun. I actually enjoyed that.

1075
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
There will be more inkling.

1076
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
How do I deal with inventory?

1077
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I want to put that one there.

1078
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
And then the other two don't really matter.

1079
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I mean, I guess we can't go there.

1080
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
We need to make a move.

1081
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Like Jagger.

1082
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Is that my marker?

1083
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
That's just the game.

1084
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Oh no, someone just took it.

1085
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Someone's at that marker because they took the loot box.

1086
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
The slowest re-fling when mommy was saying something.

1087
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Sticky icky.

1088
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Hold on, you're giving her a position and we're by the lift car.

1089
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Are you not?

1090
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
There's Payton!

1091
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
There's Payton.

1092
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Oh, there's shooting! There's crossfire!

1093
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
I repeat, there's crossfire!

1094
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Approximately

1095
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
two, five, eight, west or something.

1096
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Oh, I didn't mean to fall down.

1097
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
I'm going to be honest.

1098
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I'm not supposed to fall down.

1099
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Okay, control all the loot.

1100
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
I'm just going to pretend these are bots.

1101
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Hopefully.

1102
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Maybe it's shouldn't.

1103
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Okay.

1104
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
I don't know if they're real.

1105
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
I don't know if something's shooting at me.

1106
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Oh, I'm actually under fire for one!

1107
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
I think they might be real people.

1108
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
The boats have never hit me before.

1109
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
There's over there.

1110
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Over there by the purple.

1111
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Stop it!

1112
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Oh, they're in the car!

1113
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Do them NPCs!

1114
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Is that real?

1115
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
I don't know.

1116
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
I think they're driving away from us.

1117
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
They're too scared.

1118
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
They're coming back for more!

1119
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
They're hitting the replaying!

1120
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Save him!

1121
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
I'm out of stamina. Hold on.

1122
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Wait, I don't want to waste all my ammo

1123
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
trying to blow up a car.

1124
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Let me be honest.

1125
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
It just seems like it'll work.

1126
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Shield list!

1127
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
He's not in the car! I keep hitting him!

1128
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
He's looking nice.

1129
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
There's also enemies over there

1130
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
that have spotted me.

1131
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
I have no healing either.

1132
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Wait, your shield can recharge on its own?

1133
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
What does that mean?

1134
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
I don't know where that enemy was that hit me.

1135
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Oh no, the zone!

1136
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Reflings, we got a move for the zone, okay?

1137
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I think we just need to be a line up.

1138
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
I don't know. I'm getting nervous.

1139
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Please don't shoot me.

1140
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Please don't shoot me. We are souls over there.

1141
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
I'm getting nervous.

1142
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
When you see people through the walls,

1143
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,000
it's because I hired a recon scout NPC.

1144
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Heeeeeee!

1145
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
It was OP AF.

1146
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Sorry, I'm getting shot at.

1147
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
I think I'm getting shot at.

1148
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
I don't know.

1149
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
I don't have any healing either.

1150
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Let's just try and get the high ground

1151
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
so we don't get shot from that palace behind.

1152
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
You we are souls!

1153
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Right, get to the high ground.

1154
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Let's Star Wars this stuff.

1155
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
It's over Anakin!

1156
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I have the high ground!

1157
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,000
You underestimate my power.

1158
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Ahhhhhh!

1159
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Ahhhhhh!

1160
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Did you get him?

1161
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Is he dead?

1162
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
I need to thank him.

1163
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Why is it whenever you need heals of some kind?

1164
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
The game is like,

1165
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
you have nothing and you'll be kind to people.

1166
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
That sounds like a good book.

1167
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Wait.

1168
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Can I just hear it?

1169
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
I really have to use bandages?

1170
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
That's how bad it is?

1171
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Oh, your spray!

1172
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
You can spray me!

1173
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Spray all over me.

1174
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Spray all over me.

1175
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Let's chug this at least.

1176
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
It looks like you can chug another at least.

1177
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:47,000
I've got a little UMP if they get a little too close to me.

1178
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Mummy's thinking he needs deodorant.

1179
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Are you stopping me from pheromone maxims?

1180
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
That's so real though.

1181
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Oh my god, we're inking!

1182
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Inking!

1183
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Okay, I have heals.

1184
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
I have shields.

1185
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Okay, I'm 100% let's go.

1186
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
I literally sprayed me down with deodorant.

1187
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
They're like, we've had enough of your mummy.

1188
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Ah, here it is.

1189
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Up here.

1190
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Just heals.

1191
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Oh my god, okay.

1192
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
I'm de-pheromone maxim.

1193
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Oh, we're in trouble, hold on.

1194
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
That's what I think about your friend.

1195
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I think we need to heal.

1196
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Are we okay?

1197
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
I don't know yet.

1198
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
I haven't decided if we're okay yet.

1199
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
I haven't decided if we're safe or not.

1200
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Is that an enemy?

1201
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Wait.

1202
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
I don't think so.

1203
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Hold on, I need to reload.

1204
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
This is embarrassing.

1205
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Up on the hill, on the hill where I was.

1206
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
On the hill, somewhere.

1207
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Oh my gosh.

1208
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

1209
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
He's trying to snipe.

1210
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
It's Vegeta.

1211
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Oh my god, I'm so low ammo, please.

1212
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Oh, we did it.

1213
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
We did it.

1214
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
No, but actually, we did it.

1215
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Wait, no, he's got definitely...

1216
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
He's like...

1217
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
I don't think these are both anymore.

1218
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
I think these are real players.

1219
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Oh my gosh, I think these are real players.

1220
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
I think they're real.

1221
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
I'll have my thingy.

1222
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Thank you, Rufling.

1223
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Oh my gosh.

1224
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Oh, the zone, the zone!

1225
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Rufling meh.

1226
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
We don't want to get in trouble.

1227
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
I don't want to die from the zone.

1228
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
No, that's Goku.

1229
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
And Goku.

1230
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
And before we...

1231
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Right, okay.

1232
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
I don't want to get in his bots anymore.

1233
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
That was very not bot-like behavior.

1234
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
That was definitely a player.

1235
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Wait, sorry, is this Copium?

1236
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
I can't tell, I don't know.

1237
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Okay.

1238
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
I'm gonna take a knell.

1239
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
I'm gonna knob him.

1240
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
And you pinganoo.

1241
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Not bot-like behavior, don't worry.

1242
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Rap god on your team.

1243
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
I'm beginning to feel like a rap god.

1244
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Rap god.

1245
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Is that us making that noise?

1246
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Uh, tangos.

1247
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
What is going on?

1248
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Okay, that is a bot, right?

1249
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Surely.

1250
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
I don't know, I can't tell.

1251
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
I'm like, because if I was on the other...

1252
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Like, if I put myself in there shoes,

1253
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
I'm like, yeah, I'd probably be sniping from a car too.

1254
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
I can't tell.

1255
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Like, I would back off from my fight.

1256
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
No, no, they are real players.

1257
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
I don't know, you guys are teasing me.

1258
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Are you just being nice to me so I don't get my feelings hurt?

1259
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
I'm tryharding against bot.

1260
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Okay, news on the bot.

1261
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Unlocked.

1262
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Uh, we do need to move again.

1263
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Right, we'll just move on.

1264
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Uh...

1265
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Can we go across?

1266
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
They're totally players.

1267
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Wait, are they not?

1268
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
But they've got skins and stuff.

1269
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Are they allowed to skin?

1270
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Uh...

1271
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Whoa, scary.

1272
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
There's a thing there, though.

1273
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
I want it. Technically,

1274
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
you're not in a bot match because you have the reasons.

1275
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
I don't know, you tell me.

1276
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Stop! Wait, are these bots?

1277
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
They are the most players.

1278
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Stop!

1279
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Have I been thinking against real people

1280
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
this time and freaking out?

1281
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
When did the bot stop, though?

1282
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Because I've had a few matches now.

1283
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Uh...

1284
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Right, we're...

1285
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
We're in the Nitro Dome.

1286
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Ultimate, uh, I guess?

1287
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Maybe, like, pleasant?

1288
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
100% clear, stop!

1289
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
You're too nice to me.

1290
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Okay, if it's bots,

1291
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
then we're gonna get going.

1292
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
We're gonna hit the griddy

1293
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
and get going.

1294
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Can I climb up here? I'm not sure.

1295
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Oh, I wasted one of my zooms.

1296
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Uh...

1297
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
I don't particularly see anyone.

1298
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Survivor.

1299
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Are you winning, son?

1300
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Uh...

1301
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
I think so.

1302
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Maybe a little bit against bots?

1303
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Oh, no, one of the reeflings are stuck back there.

1304
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
I think we're over here.

1305
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Okay, if I can't find any equipment

1306
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
to give them an upgrade,

1307
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
I guess we'll just...

1308
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Right, so when I enter the water,

1309
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
it gives me, like, a zoom thing,

1310
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
but it's limited. There's only three zooms.

1311
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Oh, I hear a chest.

1312
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Wow, I like how it just explodes.

1313
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
I should do it that way.

1314
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Which is rather satisfying.

1315
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Want me to carry?

1316
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
I've got six birds on the stream.

1317
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Sorry, six birds and errors from the game.

1318
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Okay.

1319
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Oh, my God! I can roleplay!

1320
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Hello, reefling.

1321
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
What can I get for your order today?

1322
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Would you like salmon?

1323
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Would you like whatever that unidentifiable meat is?

1324
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Would you like some shrimp?

1325
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Okay, um...

1326
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Oh, you would like the cuttlefish

1327
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
so that's on the menu, right?

1328
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Okay, let me just bend over.

1329
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Oh, my God!

1330
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
There's an actual kitchen as well!

1331
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
All these games are so cute!

1332
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
I love it.

1333
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
It's this one.

1334
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Okay, thank you for your chance at the extreme.

1335
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Oh, you have a hypnosis medallion?

1336
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
That's so awesome!

1337
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
I'm getting ready.

1338
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Don't think I won't go to Nari and order it.

1339
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Wait, what is...

1340
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Is there a chest up here?

1341
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Something is sparkling.

1342
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Or is it the till?

1343
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
There.

1344
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
The till just has a straight up money in it.

1345
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Where's the con?

1346
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
My business is sparkling.

1347
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Ah!

1348
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Let's go kill some bugs.

1349
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Wherever they are, I don't know.

1350
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Oops, I didn't mean to do that.

1351
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
I was going to hold on to that, but I guess...

1352
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Okay, let's go to this room.

1353
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Okay, Sean.

1354
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
We back on Capital Sim.

1355
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
I don't know why I love money making games so much.

1356
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Sorry, it's just...

1357
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Oh, the money goes up!

1358
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
You already know when I'm...

1359
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
When I do my little game dev stuff.

1360
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
I'm 100%...

1361
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
I'm 100%...

1362
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Making those incremental...

1363
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Is it incremental?

1364
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Look at that.

1365
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
I've lost my...

1366
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
What is this?

1367
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Oh, it blasted me back!

1368
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Okay, I like that.

1369
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
I'm going to keep it.

1370
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
We're to search the supply drill.

1371
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
I don't know what that means.

1372
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Someone's doing something this?

1373
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
I don't... I don't know.

1374
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
One of these?

1375
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
I don't know if I was supposed to do that.

1376
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
I'm not sure.

1377
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
It's the cricket from Men in Black.

1378
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Is this your first time playing Fortnite?

1379
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
I played it when it first came out,

1380
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
but everything looks like really new.

1381
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
I don't recognize anything.

1382
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Do you want that one?

1383
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
That one's got more in it for you.

1384
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
I don't know what you're doing!

1385
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Oh, the zone, the zone!

1386
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Time to get a move on, Reflang!

1387
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Let's go!

1388
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
I'm not going to bother with the chair.

1389
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
There's 15...

1390
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
I'm glad I didn't take fall damage,

1391
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
but there's 15 players.

1392
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Wink, wink, lift.

1393
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Surely we'll get a real love in it.

1394
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
I'm sure you will.

1395
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
I don't know how to play.

1396
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
I want to go car.

1397
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Get in, losers! We're going shopping!

1398
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
You lost your go-see.

1399
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Mental games with a little inconsiderate.

1400
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Maybe when you're level 10.

1401
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
I'm 14 right now.

1402
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
I'm level 14.

1403
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Is that what we're supposed to do?

1404
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
We should drive.

1405
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
You guys trust me, a driver?

1406
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Trust, trust, trust.

1407
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Oh, you can break a window?

1408
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Is that everyone in?

1409
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Right, where are we going?

1410
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
I'm going to use the roof like a real driver.

1411
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Where are you shooting at?

1412
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Oh, sorry. Hold on.

1413
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
It's got halo controls.

1414
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Fuck it!

1415
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Let's go!

1416
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:29,000
It's got halo controls where if you look a little to the left or the right, the car starts driving.

1417
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Fuck it! We're doing a hit-and-run!

1418
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Oh wait, hit-and-run doesn't count?

1419
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
There's an enemy on the roof!

1420
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
I don't even know how that happened.

1421
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
I didn't even know enemies could do that.

1422
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Oh my god!

1423
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
All the bullets are storming.

1424
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Why do they all have gauntlets on?

1425
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Stop it!

1426
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
They-

1427
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
That's so friendly!

1428
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Stop! They all have gauntlets!

1429
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
I'm not going to make it.

1430
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
I'm not going to make it.

1431
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Wow!

1432
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
I'm not going to make it.

1433
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
I'm not going to make it.

1434
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Why are they honing it on me?

1435
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Why is this- Oh my god!

1436
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
They're all raiding cars!

1437
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Stop it!

1438
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
You're upsetting me.

1439
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
I'm not going to make it.

1440
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
All the freaking bullets are in cars right now.

1441
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
And they're all in gauntlets as well.

1442
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Why do they like- Is this to show them off?

1443
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
How did you do that?

1444
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:57,000
I don't know how you did that, but you did it.

1445
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Go and let me go.

1446
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
God!

1447
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Look at how much stuff they looted.

1448
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
About 500 shots fired in a match.

1449
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Yeah, because I'm spraying and praying.

1450
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Okay, check this one.

1451
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Oh my god, the recoil on a submachine gun is like violent.

1452
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:43,000
The submachine gun is rough.

1453
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Is there an enemy?

1454
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Oh no, there's an enemy fling!

1455
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Are you okay?

1456
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Oh, we did it!

1457
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
I didn't know we were going against the last one.

1458
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
I can't believe it.

1459
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:05,000
I can't believe the team get us one.

1460
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
We're doing it.

1461
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
This is number one.

1462
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Why don't you say GG in voice chat?

1463
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
GG!

1464
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Surely we're not going to go against freaking bullets.

1465
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
No.

1466
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
We did it, we're winning.

1467
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Number one.

1468
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Hot is on the board right now.

1469
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Just touch down to meet.

1470
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Okay, no question mark.

1471
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Real lobbies?

1472
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Or is it really like...

1473
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
You received this emote.

1474
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Shows how many crown victory royals you've won this season.

1475
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
I mean, it's already on my head, so...

1476
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
I don't know.

1477
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Right, I'm level 50.

1478
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Why...

1479
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Why would it not...

1480
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Sorry, I pitched it in my little board.

1481
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Why would it not...

1482
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Put me in a human game now?

1483
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
I've been playing for so long!

1484
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

1485
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

1486
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
What?

1487
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
You are either the best or the luckiest player I've ever seen.

1488
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Don't make me admit it out loud.

1489
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Thank you for this super chat.

1490
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Admit it out loud!

1491
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:37,000
The custom matches should work now that you've levelled up.

1492
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
I don't know, those weren't both actions.

1493
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:43,000
If she got that more, doesn't that mean it was a human game?

1494
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Maybe?

1495
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
There were some people in that match.

1496
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Custom matches are done if you do custom...

1497
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
No, the custom key is like only...

1498
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Hold on, I can actually show you.

1499
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
The custom key is like...

1500
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
It's used for private matches tournaments,

1501
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
but you have to make it...

1502
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
You have to make it...

1503
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
With them.

1504
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
I can't just...

1505
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
It's not like I use the same code.

1506
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Reflings!

1507
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
I'm just gonna...

1508
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Select no builds.

1509
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Zero builds.

1510
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Select...

1511
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Stop putting me in battle lobbies, I'm level 15 now.

1512
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Come on, let me get wrecked and ruined.

1513
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Okay, post your names and then I'll add you.

1514
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
It's a number one victory for you.

1515
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:35,000
We have a lot of matches about to get it down.

1516
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
All this in the world right now.

1517
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Just touch them to make it down.

1518
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
And add...

1519
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Spot and...

1520
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Enter...

1521
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Add...

1522
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
And then...

1523
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Enter...

1524
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Boom.

1525
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
There's my... Oh no, there's two of you.

1526
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Okay, it must be the first result.

1527
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
There's only one.

1528
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
There's only one, okay?

1529
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Okay, let me write down the names.

1530
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
These guys come in the lobby.

1531
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Rinn...

1532
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
It's so useful.

1533
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
It literally sounds like Smog.

1534
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Um...

1535
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:25,000
John, Omni, Present...

1536
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
And last but not least, they accept...

1537
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Question mark.

1538
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Did you get the friend request?

1539
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:37,000
I swear, if you got open make on, I'm gonna fart down it.

1540
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:41,000
You gotta turn that open make off right now, unless...

1541
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Wait, if it's console, is it always open?

1542
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
No, it can't be.

1543
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
No, it used to be open.

1544
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Ah, no, the keyboard taping as he tries to close the open make.

1545
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Again here, I heard that fart.

1546
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Oh no, did the other friend request not go through?

1547
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Wait, why does that not work?

1548
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Okay, spa, I'm gonna try you again.

1549
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Wasn't I not you that I tried to get?

1550
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Did I forget to hit send?

1551
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
No, you didn't come up.

1552
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Can he be your name?

1553
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Okay, that didn't...

1554
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Plus, I've already played with you, you goober.

1555
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
I heard that fart.

1556
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Okay, bear teddy.

1557
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Wait, why is this not working?

1558
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
No, you guys are taping and names aren't real.

1559
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Are you trolling me?

1560
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
It doesn't say you're real players.

1561
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Okay, it says you're a real player.

1562
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Okay, so we have...

1563
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Well, if you come in...

1564
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
I wrote your name down.

1565
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Okay, yeah, you can come in.

1566
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
We have Ruin, John and Sanix.

1567
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:00,000
So we're super fast, we're super destructive.

1568
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,000
And we're super omnipresent, which means all-knowing.

1569
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
So...

1570
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
We're like gods?

1571
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Okay, mm-hmm.

1572
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:14,000
So if we're like gods, the team name is gonna be...

1573
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,000
I don't know.

1574
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
God's Prime?

1575
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
We're gonna be called the Prime Gods.

1576
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Why not?

1577
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
We are Prime Gods.

1578
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Because we're just so good like that.

1579
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Let's go.

1580
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

1581
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Waiting for three more players to ready up.

1582
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
You stinker-tins.

1583
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Team 2 is the best team to watch.

1584
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
I am...

1585
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,000
You are in it!

1586
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,000
That's why...

1587
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Strong John...

1588
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Runic.

1589
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Honestly, that's probably better than what I came up with.

1590
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
I said Prime Gods.

1591
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:54,000
This is the team name.

1592
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
So we've had the Chikmul fumblings.

1593
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,000
We've had the Reckoning of the Radical Reflings processors.

1594
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:03,000
We've had the Giddies and they're the Prime Gods.

1595
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Oh, yeah.

1596
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Ready up.

1597
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Waiting for magic.

1598
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Hydration check, Reflings.

1599
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Corner time.

1600
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,000
We ate.

1601
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Run a train on your enemies with pleasure.

1602
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:22,000
I also run a train on my allies too.

1603
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Can you see that?

1604
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Ready?

1605
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,000
I don't know.

1606
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,000
I don't know.

1607
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,000
I don't know.

1608
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,000
I'm glowing.

1609
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Literally, I'm glowing because the Reflings have been inking on me.

1610
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Are you real?

1611
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Are you an NPC?

1612
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Are you an NPC?

1613
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Be honest.

1614
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Look into my eyes.

1615
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Are you a real player?

1616
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Are you a real player?

1617
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Okay.

1618
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
I think you've still got some balls.

1619
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
What?

1620
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
They're just randomly emoting.

1621
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Where did the bot stop?

1622
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,000
That's it.

1623
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
I'm opening up another tab.

1624
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Failed tonight.

1625
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
When do bot stop?

1626
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
What level?

1627
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
At what point do you stop playing bot?

1628
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Level 10 or win three games?

1629
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
That was from three years ago though.

1630
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
I feel like this shit's probably...

1631
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Where are we going?

1632
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,000
I don't know.

1633
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,000
You know what?

1634
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,000
I've not been...

1635
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
I've not been a brutal beachhead.

1636
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Let's just go all the way to the end.

1637
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
We'll raid it to the end.

1638
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,000
You run the train on enemies, then allies run the train on you.

1639
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,000
True, three games.

1640
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,000
I've already played three games though.

1641
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Okay, we're gonna drop right at the end.

1642
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Wee!

1643
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,000
He's...

1644
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,000
No fighting.

1645
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
You'll have to...

1646
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
He's cleaning the vomit.

1647
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
I have to watch the radio.

1648
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
I even know you're getting into my lobbies,

1649
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:14,000
because I'm an Australian server,

1650
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,000
but I don't even...

1651
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Okay, there's an ampie?

1652
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Not to alert anyone,

1653
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
but it seems like we're not the only ones here somehow.

1654
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
God, we're in fricking junk town.

1655
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Oh, we got the hit.

1656
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,000
The hit game?

1657
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
No, we're not really a hit game anymore.

1658
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Right, okay.

1659
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,000
New location.

1660
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
We're at the assault rifle.

1661
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Happy days for me.

1662
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Oh, replays!

1663
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
I get to ink on you.

1664
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
And there's a gun here too.

1665
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Where are my replays?

1666
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Would you all like to gather for our daily inkening?

1667
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Even though there's enemies right there.

1668
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Okay, there's enemies first and then we ink.

1669
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,000
New...

1670
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Uh-huh.

1671
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Uh-huh.

1672
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Okay, this is the ball.

1673
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Come on.

1674
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Fartnate, you're ruining it.

1675
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
You're ruining it.

1676
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,000
You're ruining it.

1677
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,000
You're ruining it.

1678
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Why?

1679
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Can I not get a human?

1680
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Please don't think I won't revisit this game.

1681
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
I'm actually really enjoying myself on it.

1682
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
I really enjoy playing with you guys.

1683
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
I should hit them in the butt.

1684
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Oh, no, sorry.

1685
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,000
There's one right there.

1686
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Okay.

1687
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
They didn't exactly drop much lid.

1688
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Woo!

1689
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Oh, I didn't mean to do that, but it's okay.

1690
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Everything's fine.

1691
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Okay, are you ready for our group inkening?

1692
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Ready?

1693
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Okay, everyone come here for the group inkening.

1694
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,000
I'm squirting.

1695
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Thank you for letting me squirt for the first time.

1696
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
I appreciate it.

1697
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
We did it.

1698
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
We did it.

1699
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Oh, there's a chance.

1700
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Okay.

1701
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:34,000
I'm going to mostly get a little bit of ammunition in my life.

1702
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
A little bit of...

1703
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
A little bit of monocles.

1704
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
A little bit of...

1705
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Almost.

1706
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Almost.

1707
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:48,000
A little bit of aces all on me.

1708
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
A little bit of earwax.

1709
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,000
All on me.

1710
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:54,000
A little bit of she who comes.

1711
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:58,000
A little bit of hazard to shove my face in here.

1712
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Fun little bit.

1713
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
A little bit of mercy.

1714
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
To make me plead for mercy.

1715
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
A little bit.

1716
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Woo!

1717
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,000
I ain't that fast.

1718
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Take that, Mr. Bot.

1719
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
And this, Mr. Bot.

1720
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,000
How are you?

1721
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Assist.

1722
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Yeah, assist my art hole.

1723
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Reefling Siggum.

1724
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
I might even caca.

1725
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Wait, someone else is shooting him too?

1726
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Or is that you guys shooting him?

1727
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Hold on.

1728
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,000
What is he doing?

1729
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
What are you doing?

1730
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Is that the...

1731
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:45,000
To shove your face in?

1732
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Yeah, like a mortar bullet?

1733
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Why...

1734
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Oh, here he is.

1735
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,000
How do they always have those mythic gloves on?

1736
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Oh, he's rolling...

1737
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:00,000
He's running over!

1738
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,000
He's running over!

1739
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
You know, that's the...

1740
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,000
What is it?

1741
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Did he call it, like, auto by death or something like that?

1742
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Okay, that's not bad.

1743
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,000
That's not bad.

1744
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,000
That's not bad.

1745
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:16,000
We are just gonna head for the middle of the map

1746
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
and beat up every bot along the way.

1747
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Because I don't know, I...

1748
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,000
I'm not sure.

1749
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:22,000
I might...

1750
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
What I'll do is play offline

1751
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,000
to, like, leveled up.

1752
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:29,000
And when I'm satisfied that I'm going against humans,

1753
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
we'll do another stream snipe on Fortnite

1754
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:34,000
because I'm really struggling to understand

1755
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:37,000
why it's not giving us humans.

1756
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:44,000
I refuse to believe that there's a lot of humans in this game

1757
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:48,000
when it's, like, yeah, there's, like, almost 400,000 players,

1758
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,000
so I'm...

1759
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,000
I don't know.

1760
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
I'm finding it hard to...

1761
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
to believe them when it's, like...

1762
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,000
I don't know.

1763
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
I will take two hours to download Fortnite.

1764
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
How long are you streaming?

1765
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Oh!

1766
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,000
I was gonna...

1767
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:04,000
I'm struggling to get human lobbies.

1768
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,000
I don't know.

1769
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Mummy, check their names on the bottom left

1770
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
after you tell them to see if they have bots

1771
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
and their names are real ones.

1772
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Little Mia, 50, Bryson, 6'6", Pickle, 60.

1773
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Yeah, these are the same format over and over.

1774
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Mate, this one's very bottom.

1775
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Alright, I helped.

1776
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,000
I helped.

1777
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,000
You saw that.

1778
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,000
You saw me helping.

1779
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Dude, I didn't see that coming.

1780
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Where are...

1781
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,000
I can't reach...

1782
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:48,000
to ever to download the...

1783
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
I think the last one looked really,

1784
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
even given off too much for a bot,

1785
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:10,000
movement. I don't I don't know what would change. Like what's going on?

1786
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Oh no, what happened? Did you fall to your death?

1787
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,000
I might go.

1788
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Let's keep this one.

1789
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:28,000
I'm sure it's humans with a lower skill level with that number of hot sprinkles in it.

1790
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Is it because I'm on Aussie server? Right, hold on. Right, after this one we're going to pick American servers, okay?

1791
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Well, it's 8am. Is it really that much?

1792
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Servers over here? Tell you what, right, we'll play one more after this.

1793
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,000
And we'll swap to American servers on purpose.

1794
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:55,000
And if we're still against bots, I'll just play on my own and then we'll actually try and stream snipe next time.

1795
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Because we'll know what's up, right? Okay, let's go to the middle of the map to kill as much as possible.

1796
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
I searched all these servers so easier.

1797
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Home advantage gone. Real and true though.

1798
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,000
It's probably better that you guys have better ping than me.

1799
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:20,000
If we actually do go against humans because there's no way.

1800
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Name location. Let's check out my map.

1801
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:26,000
See, look, it's like getting less gray.

1802
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:32,000
When you first start playing, you are put into lobbies with bots but it slowly integrates more women.

1803
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
So there is a chance.

1804
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
I really just keep playing.

1805
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Well, that seemed a bit human-like.

1806
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,000
I don't know.

1807
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
I don't know if it's copium but...

1808
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Why is this place so loud? It's so loud in here.

1809
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Am I perfect?

1810
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
I mean, I'd rather not, but...

1811
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Two hours to download.

1812
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
My download is still at 24%. Oh, no!

1813
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,000
There's a lot going on in that pit.

1814
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
I need a headache.

1815
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:26,000
If the glasses don't give me a headache first, that load location.

1816
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Cabbage! My cabbages!

1817
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:35,000
I'm going to end up getting hurt.

1818
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Exploring without the reeflings.

1819
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Watch me not be with a reefling for five seconds and then I'll just instantly die.

1820
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
I have to spectate them for the rest of the games.

1821
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
I think they're doing fine.

1822
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,000
There's a loophole.

1823
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,000
My nephew's better than me.

1824
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
I like to watch off the pathway in.

1825
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,000
I'm being brave!

1826
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:09,000
It's totally not because I know that the odds of me coming across through people are really low right now.

1827
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Mummy has abandoned her reeflings?

1828
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Are the reeflings not keeping up with my marker?

1829
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,000
We need to go in the middle.

1830
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Oh, they're in a car.

1831
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Who's driving this car?

1832
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:27,000
I'm too late to download the game again.

1833
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Don't worry, we'll most likely play it again because I actually really am enjoying this.

1834
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
We're just... I didn't realize...

1835
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,000
I don't know.

1836
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:39,000
I just thought we wouldn't get bought.

1837
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
I don't know why, because obviously it makes sense for new players.

1838
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:44,000
But I didn't think...

1839
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:48,000
No, you're not destroying Olympus.

1840
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:50,000
We can't be bothered.

1841
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,000
We're going for it.

1842
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
We're going for it.

1843
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
I need to go in there.

1844
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:05,000
I've got to go.

1845
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Sadly, otherwise I'm going to get carsick.

1846
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Oh no, don't get carsick.

1847
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,000
I have violent carsick, so I completely get you.

1848
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Please don't worry.

1849
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,000
They destroyed Azura's temple.

1850
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:21,000
It's actually funny how Azura's lore kind of developed.

1851
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Because she was supposed to be a lot more like your her servant, but it kind of changed.

1852
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:36,000
You know, you can tell by her first month, her first month of Patreon scripts,

1853
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:41,000
I made it very like your her servant, but that didn't really come to be.

1854
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Like, as I said, obviously I didn't know the girls before they, you know, got hold of them type thing.

1855
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:52,000
And it's just interesting like how I theorized though it would work out like this, it would work out like that.

1856
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:54,000
And we're like, please do this, please do that.

1857
02:12:55,000 --> 02:13:00,000
And that angle just kind of completely, it says there's like a chest right here.

1858
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Oh, I'm needing like a blue one.

1859
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Is there an actual thing?

1860
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Is there an actual thing?

1861
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Please, just give me a blue gun.

1862
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
We're going to go kill bots because they'll drop more.

1863
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Dude, or what are we shooting?

1864
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Dude, they're just killing them all.

1865
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:37,000
There's shields.

1866
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:41,000
Sonic, you need to fill your shields.

1867
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
You can force to drink. Yeah, that's right.

1868
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Listen to your mom.

1869
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Reeflings are so well behaved, they always listen.

1870
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Everyone's shields are filled with that naturopath.

1871
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Oh, you want to fist me?

1872
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:04,000
It's just flying.

1873
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Do you not take full damage if you just heat yourself?

1874
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Well, let's find out.

1875
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Oh, they've got a cooldown, so I can't.

1876
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I don't want to fall down.

1877
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:24,000
How do you jump?

1878
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Oh!

1879
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
That's very low, please.

1880
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
No more.

1881
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Can't take anything being low.

1882
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Where are the bots?

1883
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Why aren't they coming closer?

1884
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
So I don't need to swap servers then?

1885
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:49,000
It's just kind of a timed thing as I level up.

1886
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Scanning for bots.

1887
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Oh, we need to play Star Wars Battlefront, actually.

1888
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Liz, are we following San?

1889
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Okay, let's go.

1890
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Okay, I like this mode of transport.

1891
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:24,000
I'm not doing it the best, but it's actually very efficient.

1892
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Oh, there we go.

1893
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
Now hold on, let me in the fight too.

1894
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Hold on a minute, hold on a minute, let me in the fight.

1895
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Don't put me out yet, coach.

1896
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Okay, I can see that I put mobility stuff in.

1897
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
She's insane, third party.

1898
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
We've lost the command post.

1899
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Yeah, you know Star Wars Battlefront?

1900
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
My dad let me play it all the time.

1901
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:06,000
And I got to kill the piggie wiggies on the DLCs.

1902
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
The DLCs were free, they just pushed them.

1903
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Wait, aren't we out of the zone?

1904
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,000
No, we're in it.

1905
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
We're just going to the edge of the map.

1906
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Oh my god, this is the North Pole outpost where everyone dies.

1907
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,000
I'll pick that.

1908
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Don't mind further.

1909
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Okay, and then if we go this way.

1910
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:43,000
I don't know how the render distance works with a heat seeker.

1911
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Are we sniping?

1912
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Oh, holy shit, what's that fall off?

1913
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
No, no, no, hold on, let me reload, don't move.

1914
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Don't move.

1915
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
No, I don't know what the fall is.

1916
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:02,000
How are you supposed to guess what the fall off is?

1917
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,000
I have no idea.

1918
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Alright, let's get some good aiming.

1919
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Get some good aiming, where are they?

1920
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
There's two of them, right?

1921
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Come on.

1922
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Get them.

1923
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Cannot sprint, low energy.

1924
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Are you still not dead after that?

1925
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Are you serious?

1926
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:33,000
It runs away.

1927
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:36,000
I finally get into a fight and it's just like, I'm out.

1928
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Ah, there's one of my rooflings there.

1929
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Ah, is this a real?

1930
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Are they real?

1931
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Why are these two of you down?

1932
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
You're making me scared.

1933
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Are we against real people?

1934
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,000
I don't know.

1935
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Oh my god.

1936
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Oh my god.

1937
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Oh my god, I think that may be a real person.

1938
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Oh my god, that candle looks real though.

1939
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,000
I'm getting hurt.

1940
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
I don't know what you want me to do.

1941
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Here, what?

1942
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
Okay, right, I need focus.

1943
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,000
I need focus.

1944
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Focus.

1945
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Right, lovely.

1946
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Oh my god.

1947
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:40,000
They're kind of real.

1948
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Are they?

1949
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:44,000
I can't tell.

1950
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:45,000
I honestly can't.

1951
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
I'm getting so confuzzled.

1952
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:51,000
There's two down in that place I just saw.

1953
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
I don't know if they're real or not.

1954
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get over there.

1955
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Oh my god.

1956
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Ah, come on, the sniper takes so long.

1957
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Where'd you go?

1958
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Where'd you go, yellow?

1959
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Hey, could you imagine though if I hit that?

1960
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:30,000
I'd be like the coolest player ever, you know?

1961
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Oh, I missed.

1962
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Okay, I hit the wrong, I forgot.

1963
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:35,000
Like, forget this.

1964
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,000
This isn't working.

1965
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Huh?

1966
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:43,000
Oh.

1967
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Oh.

1968
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
They're like rendered this thing so far.

1969
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:51,000
There's still a twat bag and a list over there.

1970
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:56,000
I don't know if we just need to go down and like literally attack.

1971
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
A bit more up.

1972
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Okay, up, up, up.

1973
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
Oh, it cracked them.

1974
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
I got 58.

1975
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Oh.

1976
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:19,000
I don't know why the bots are honing in on us.

1977
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Oh, it cracked.

1978
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:27,000
I don't know.

1979
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:28,000
I mean, if we're happy.

1980
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Oh no, this one's all the way over there, right?

1981
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,000
We need to move.

1982
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
Okay, this one's over here.

1983
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
So let's just move for this one.

1984
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:40,000
And if we kill a few baddies on the way, then...

1985
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Wait, are they getting attacked?

1986
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Hmm.

1987
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
She's cracking.

1988
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
I'm cracking up.

1989
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
I'm just using the overheat scan, by the way.

1990
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Before you're like, why are you aiming like that?

1991
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,000
It's the heat scan.

1992
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:01,000
And use the sleep.

1993
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:02,000
All right, okay.

1994
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Let's just make a little cheeky leg over to the next zone.

1995
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Because it's literally about to close in on us, like right now.

1996
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:17,000
I hear things.

1997
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Oh.

1998
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Give it a rest.

1999
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:28,000
What's this?

2000
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Ow, that's not friendly.

2001
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:33,000
It's friendly at all.

2002
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
And I'm no out of position.

2003
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:36,000
I'm no out of position.

2004
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Please!

2005
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Actually losing supports!

2006
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Oh my god, I'm actually losing supports.

2007
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Hold on, I need to heal up.

2008
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:51,000
I went too far without my rivelling.

2009
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
I don't have any heals on me.

2010
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Oopsies.

2011
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Oopsies, I'm just going to hide behind this rock

2012
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:00,000
and hope that the old snake won't end before me.

2013
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Oh, I'm getting pissed on.

2014
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Thank you.

2015
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,000
I'm getting screwed in.

2016
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Oh, thank you, the Lord of the Boots.

2017
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Six out of five gifted members.

2018
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,000
I'm not even playing well.

2019
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Why are you gifted new memberships?

2020
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:19,000
It's literally never pleased with terribly in my life.

2021
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:25,000
I'm not going to make it.

2022
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
There's some flat behind that rock.

2023
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:30,000
I don't know.

2024
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Stop happening.

2025
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Oh my god.

2026
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:42,000
It's never ending.

2027
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Oh my god.

2028
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,000
That was so unlucky.

2029
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Oh no!

2030
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:50,000
What am I doing?

2031
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Oh no!

2032
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,000
We lost the boss.

2033
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:56,000
Oh no!

2034
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,000
That was so good.

2035
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:00,000
Oh yeah.

2036
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Oh no!

2037
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:06,000
That was bizarre.

2038
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Nothing was going right.

2039
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Magnet was busted.

2040
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:12,000
No way that was a boss.

2041
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:15,000
That was like really weird gameplay.

2042
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
That was really weird.

2043
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:25,000
There's like a weird background statistic audio important.

2044
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Can you hear that?

2045
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:28,000
It's like.

2046
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:30,000
What is that?

2047
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:32,000
It's not me.

2048
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:33,000
I only have this up.

2049
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:36,000
It was a refling's mic.

2050
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
I'm so sorry.

2051
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:39,000
I'm so sorry.

2052
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:40,000
That was your mic.

2053
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
I am so sorry.

2054
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:43,000
Whoopsies.

2055
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:46,000
I forget it was me making but it wasn't seen in him.

2056
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Sorry refling.

2057
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:48,000
I didn't mean to call you out like that.

2058
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:49,000
I didn't mean to call you out like that.

2059
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:50,000
I didn't realize.

2060
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Okay.

2061
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:52,000
We'll play one more.

2062
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:54,000
And if it.

2063
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:55,000
If it.

2064
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Leave parties and then do it like that.

2065
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Okay.

2066
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:04,000
Okay.

2067
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:05,000
That's fine.

2068
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:06,000
From my friend.

2069
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Yep.

2070
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:08,000
And then we'll get new refling in.

2071
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Okay.

2072
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:11,000
I don't know.

2073
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Sorry.

2074
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
I was like, oh that's weird.

2075
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:17,000
There's like some weird white noise going on in this game.

2076
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,000
The refling's open mic.

2077
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Sorry.

2078
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Okay.

2079
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
Who have I not played with that would like to play.

2080
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Okay.

2081
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
I think this might be our last one.

2082
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Just because of.

2083
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,000
Just because.

2084
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Sorry.

2085
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:35,000
No.

2086
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:36,000
It's fine.

2087
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Let's have a big team.

2088
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Just because.

2089
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:42,000
I'm going to play offline to get out of this fricking ball.

2090
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:43,000
Such a.

2091
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Because the queen joins the fortnight grains.

2092
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:49,000
Literally.

2093
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
It's so good.

2094
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:54,000
It's such a good stream snipe game as well.

2095
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Because it's free to play.

2096
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:56,000
Which I like.

2097
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:57,000
Because unfortunately I'm actually playing.

2098
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
I'm doing a game next.

2099
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:02,000
That I've not done before.

2100
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Let me write down the names.

2101
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:05,000
Met a.

2102
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:06,000
Oracle.

2103
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Not to be confused with Polo.

2104
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:10,000
Okay.

2105
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:11,000
Let's try again.

2106
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Rest time after.

2107
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Yeah.

2108
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
A few things that you do in the background.

2109
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:19,000
So this might.

2110
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:20,000
As I said.

2111
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:21,000
This might be our last one.

2112
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:22,000
I can't wait for Halo tomorrow.

2113
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:23,000
Yeah.

2114
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:24,000
I can get my rest.

2115
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:27,000
Okay.

2116
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Does that work?

2117
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:29,000
It did.

2118
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:30,000
Okay.

2119
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:31,000
That worked.

2120
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:33,000
Let's see.

2121
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Can you guys carry me against the box is the real question.

2122
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:39,000
I don't know.

2123
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Yeah.

2124
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Right.

2125
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:44,000
What should our team be called?

2126
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:45,000
We've got.

2127
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Um.

2128
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Okay.

2129
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:54,000
We've got a family guy character.

2130
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
We've got toga.

2131
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
And then we've got a default.

2132
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Default.

2133
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Maybe we should name a show like default toga guy.

2134
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,000
I don't know.

2135
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:10,000
I don't know.

2136
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:11,000
What should we name this view?

2137
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Don't forget to change it from oceanic.

2138
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:14,000
I don't know.

2139
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Hmm.

2140
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Thank you again for the gifted members.

2141
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
It's the booty lord and congrats to those who caught them.

2142
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Put your face.

2143
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Put your face.

2144
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:23,000
Okay.

2145
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
We'll call the team peter.

2146
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Peter.

2147
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
The yandere is here.

2148
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:29,000
Okay.

2149
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:30,000
So.

2150
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:35,000
The yandere is here.

2151
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:39,000
You're playing my climb.

2152
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
What's going on here?

2153
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Okay.

2154
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:43,000
Ready up.

2155
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:45,000
Time to ready up.

2156
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
We've got a little snake thing going on.

2157
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:48,000
I don't know what that is.

2158
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
People didn't.

2159
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:53,000
All suits and protective IRP was cool.

2160
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Is that a type of game mode or am I being dumb?

2161
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
They've got some nice skins.

2162
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Victory Royale.

2163
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:03,000
Yeah.

2164
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
We're about to get down.

2165
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
The accent spawn.

2166
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Peter.

2167
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Peter.

2168
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,000
Peter.

2169
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:12,000
What are you doing?

2170
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:14,000
Okay.

2171
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
That's awful.

2172
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Mark, cool.

2173
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Please ready up.

2174
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:20,000
We can do it.

2175
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Peter.

2176
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:25,000
The yandere is here.

2177
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:26,000
What's behind you?

2178
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Peena.

2179
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Wake up.

2180
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Wake up.

2181
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:33,000
The person the A looks like Targaryen.

2182
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:35,000
The brain roll.

2183
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:37,000
I still let you weigh.

2184
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000

2192
02:28:37,240 --> 02:28:45,920
game does that mean does that mean the bros delay is next week does that mean

2193
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:50,600
we're in a real game because if it's filled by both then it would take a long

2194
02:28:50,600 --> 02:28:57,120
time right but if it's filled with humans I think I think we're against real

2195
02:28:57,120 --> 02:29:02,560
people this time it only took us two and a half hours to get against real people

2196
02:29:02,560 --> 02:29:08,960
hold on right take a look around so those with the box that's two ball groups

2197
02:29:08,960 --> 02:29:15,840
wait a minute aren't you the chicken from before I can't see your name

2198
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:24,440
hold on a minute you look like you're real hmm so there's two ball groups but

2199
02:29:24,480 --> 02:29:29,680
like if you look around there's what's doing stuff that's not me my mate don't

2200
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:33,000
you mean another way around no I didn't get in our man real people it's go time

2201
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:50,880
more real players than before I don't know are you both I don't know I feel like

2202
02:29:50,880 --> 02:29:54,280
we're against the real people this time

2203
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:08,200
they can just make sure where should we go I've not been to Grand Glacier when

2204
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:14,640
we go there okay let's go to Grand Glacier

2205
02:30:16,720 --> 02:30:23,400
Peter the real enemies are here and then we're gonna get annihilated Peter you

2206
02:30:23,400 --> 02:30:28,560
don't understand I'm gonna watch a video on how to shoot them I think because I'm

2207
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:33,160
Aussie servers it's like nice and awful and I don't know it's because I'm playing with

2208
02:30:33,160 --> 02:30:37,800
the rooflings from America as well it's taking that into account because they've

2209
02:30:37,800 --> 02:30:40,560
no go

2210
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:50,280
please I'm so sorry her voice is very good for like repetitive sentences that are

2211
02:30:50,280 --> 02:30:56,280
like satisfying at least the game isn't doing the frame rate lag thing it was

2212
02:30:56,280 --> 02:31:00,920
that's it like now that we're like discovering like the locations the

2213
02:31:00,920 --> 02:31:05,720
games like yeah no I literally cannot get enough to use the door like that of

2216
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:29,040
literally in Glacier and it's like I had 370 ping I am not surprised I am not

right where's he going

2245
02:33:45,240 --> 02:33:47,240

02:33:53,240 --> 02:33:55,240

dash power

2251
02:34:03,240 --> 02:34:08,240
hi mama I have to go but it was fun watching you and everyone meet up players and

2252
02:34:08,240 --> 02:34:13,240
I wish I could have got a real player but maybe next time

2253
02:34:13,240 --> 02:34:17,240
love you love you to the reeflings don't worry we'll definitely play again I like

2254
02:34:17,240 --> 02:34:21,240
that it's a free access game as I said I think we're definitely gonna be playing

2255
02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:24,240
can we walk through this

2256
02:34:24,240 --> 02:34:26,240
we're gonna play

2257
02:34:30,240 --> 02:34:35,240
which is a play game but well I'll do the same thing where our idea is on steam

2258
02:34:35,240 --> 02:34:39,240
and then I remove and then we play next and then we'll just keep up with those

2259
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:46,240
I quite like doing it that way I don't know I don't know how you guys feel about doing it

2260
02:34:51,240 --> 02:34:54,240
oh you didn't even take the opportunity to spray me fine I'll spray myself

2261
02:34:54,240 --> 02:34:58,240

02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:37,240
oh knocked them for a whole 19

2271
02:35:37,240 --> 02:35:41,240

2272
02:35:41,240 --> 02:35:44,240
don't be too don't be too cocky okay

2273
02:35:44,240 --> 02:35:48,240
don't don't be like Skywalker because I'm Han Solo don't get cocky

2274

2281
02:36:22,240 --> 02:36:26,240
I don't think I need stealth I just need a bear whip and drink

2282
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:29,240
vermin tape more like ancient tape

2283
02:36:30,240 --> 02:36:31,240

thank you thank you

2288
02:36:54,240 --> 02:36:57,240
just respect your surroundings

2289
02:36:59,240 --> 02:37:01,240
what are you doing

2290
02:37:03,240 --> 02:37:06,240
why are you role-playing being on the show

2291
02:37:07,240 --> 02:37:10,240
I thought I was bad for role-playing Grimini as butter

2292
02:37:11,240 --> 02:37:12,240
guns

2293
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:15,240
how are you

2294
02:37:16,240 --> 02:37:20,240
you blew up you literally dropped a bomb that's how nasty your ship was

2295
02:37:20,240 --> 02:37:21,240
you literally

2296
02:37:22,240 --> 02:37:25,240
okay um

2297
02:37:29,240 --> 02:37:32,240
like I don't want to I don't want to brag about anything

2298
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:34,240
are we getting in

2299
02:37:35,240 --> 02:37:37,240
I don't know where we're going but you can take me on a journey why not

2300
02:37:37,240 --> 02:37:39,240
literally take me to the toilet

2301
02:37:39,240 --> 02:37:41,240
the real question is why are you peeking

2302
02:37:41,240 --> 02:37:44,240
I'm allowed to do what I want to the reef lens okay

2303
02:37:45,240 --> 02:37:48,240
we're actually by my royal decree

2304
02:37:48,240 --> 02:37:50,240
of being scrawny

2305
02:37:50,240 --> 02:37:53,240
that the reeflings will let me do whatever I please to them

2306
02:37:56,240 --> 02:37:58,240
oh no whoa

2307
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:09,240
I was gonna take can you wait they're called gimme Chris

2308
02:38:09,240 --> 02:38:11,240
that doesn't really seem very gauntly

2309
02:38:14,240 --> 02:38:15,240
are they alone

2310
02:38:16,240 --> 02:38:17,240
hmm

2311
02:38:18,240 --> 02:38:20,240
I'm not sure how much uh

2312
02:38:20,240 --> 02:38:24,240
did you know the devs of airman 2 are testing a versus mode

2313
02:38:24,240 --> 02:38:26,240
um I'm not sure I'm not sure

2314
02:38:27,240 --> 02:38:28,240
uh

2315
02:38:30,240 --> 02:38:32,240
can I first look

2316
02:38:34,240 --> 02:38:36,240
what's really good about things that

2317
02:38:36,240 --> 02:38:38,240
you

2318
02:38:42,240 --> 02:38:45,240
by your royal decree I am allowed to what should be

2319
02:38:45,240 --> 02:38:48,240
and what that's hold on we need to help the reeflings

2320
02:38:49,240 --> 02:38:54,240
or not reefling is fully self-sufficient doesn't need me

2321
02:38:55,240 --> 02:38:58,240
I don't know what like this all-round enforcer stuff is

2322
02:38:59,240 --> 02:39:02,240
I'm sure I'll learn at some point but right now it's not

2323
02:39:03,240 --> 02:39:06,240
oh my god this is the worst aim down the slide ever

2324
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:09,240
no don't give me that again that's awful

2325
02:39:13,240 --> 02:39:16,240
what happens to a reefling who doesn't let you take

2326
02:39:17,240 --> 02:39:21,240
you ever played the game of fire truck before

2327
02:39:21,240 --> 02:39:23,240
so I'll put my hand on your knee

2328
02:39:23,240 --> 02:39:26,240
and I'll keep slowly going up your leg okay

2329
02:39:26,240 --> 02:39:29,240
and then when you say red light I'll stop

2330
02:39:29,240 --> 02:39:30,240
okay

2331
02:39:30,240 --> 02:39:32,240
there you go red light

2332
02:39:32,240 --> 02:39:35,240
and I say fire trucks don't stop for red light

2333
02:39:37,240 --> 02:39:40,240
there's a loss to the storm the bots are literally

2334
02:39:40,240 --> 02:39:43,240
looking at themselves right let's go I guess lavishing layer

2335
02:39:43,240 --> 02:39:44,240
it's like

2336
02:39:45,240 --> 02:39:48,240
where is this way yeah let's go a bit more in the circle

2337
02:39:51,240 --> 02:39:54,240
just give me one more turn

2338
02:39:54,240 --> 02:39:56,240
what is this

2339
02:39:59,240 --> 02:40:02,240
Riz 1000 I'm not sure if that's Riz

2340
02:40:02,240 --> 02:40:06,240
I think that's more Ray you know like

2341
02:40:06,240 --> 02:40:07,240
you know

2342
02:40:08,240 --> 02:40:10,240
but whatever makes sense

2343
02:40:11,240 --> 02:40:13,240
she triggered my swallery foot

2344
02:40:16,240 --> 02:40:18,240
oh speaking of swallowing hi Jason check

2345
02:40:21,240 --> 02:40:22,240

2351
02:40:38,240 --> 02:40:40,240
I'll just delete at the end

2352
02:40:43,240 --> 02:40:45,240

oh she's so happy and cute I do love her hair

2354
02:40:48,240 --> 02:40:50,240
I have to admit it's design

2355
02:40:50,240 --> 02:40:54,240
what strongy you can't just say every time someone has to

2356
02:40:54,240 --> 02:40:56,240
make people hear it's peak design

2357
02:40:56,240 --> 02:40:58,240
what

2358
02:40:58,240 --> 02:41:00,240

2456
02:46:21,240 --> 02:46:23,240

02:50:05,240 --> 02:50:07,240
look at all that HP

2543
02:50:07,240 --> 02:50:09,240
jeez

2544
02:50:09,240 --> 02:50:11,240
look at all that HP

2545
02:50:11,240 --> 02:50:13,240
right

2546
02:50:13,240 --> 02:50:15,240
return to lobby

2547
02:50:15,240 --> 02:50:17,240
I'm gonna call it there before

2548
02:50:17,240 --> 02:50:19,240
I start having a break because

2549
02:50:19,240 --> 02:50:21,240
my eyeballs are getting used to the glasses

2550
02:50:21,240 --> 02:50:23,240
a little too much

2551
02:50:23,240 --> 02:50:25,240
that was so fun

2552
02:50:25,240 --> 02:50:27,240
100%

2553
02:50:27,240 --> 02:50:29,240
we are doing that again

2554
02:50:29,240 --> 02:50:31,240
like

2555
02:50:31,240 --> 02:50:33,240
that was so fun

2556
02:50:33,240 --> 02:50:35,240
so so fun

2557
02:50:35,240 --> 02:50:37,240
I'll definitely level up offline

2558
02:50:37,240 --> 02:50:39,240
so we get full

2559
02:50:39,240 --> 02:50:41,240
human lobbies

2560
02:50:41,240 --> 02:50:43,240
because

2561
02:50:43,240 --> 02:50:45,240
that was

2562
02:50:45,240 --> 02:50:47,240
just so fun

2563
02:50:47,240 --> 02:50:49,240
I thoroughly enjoyed that

2564
02:50:49,240 --> 02:50:51,240
I hope you guys enjoyed that

2565
02:50:51,240 --> 02:50:53,240
that just literally was

2566
02:50:53,240 --> 02:50:55,240
that felt like a gaming session

2567
02:50:55,240 --> 02:50:57,240
between mates you've not been able to catch up with

2568
02:50:57,240 --> 02:50:59,240
for a while or whatever

2569
02:50:59,240 --> 02:51:01,240
that was just absolutely 10 out of 10

2570
02:51:01,240 --> 02:51:03,240
I love that and thank you so so much

2571
02:51:03,240 --> 02:51:05,240
I literally can't even say how thankful I am

2572
02:51:05,240 --> 02:51:07,240
that was just so fun

2573
02:51:07,240 --> 02:51:09,240
I'll see if I can redirect into someone

2574
02:51:09,240 --> 02:51:11,240
I don't know if anyone's on right now

2575
02:51:11,240 --> 02:51:13,240
the upstairs is offline

2576
02:51:13,240 --> 02:51:15,240
I don't know if Emmy's up by then

2577
02:51:15,240 --> 02:51:17,240
I'm gonna check

2578
02:51:17,240 --> 02:51:19,240
I don't know if any of the girls are on

2579
02:51:19,240 --> 02:51:21,240
I've been really trying

2580
02:51:21,240 --> 02:51:23,240
as I said

2581
02:51:23,240 --> 02:51:25,240
next time we play Fortnite I will be

2582
02:51:25,240 --> 02:51:27,240
fully leveled up

2583
02:51:27,240 --> 02:51:29,240
hmm

2584
02:51:29,240 --> 02:51:31,240
there is

2585
02:51:31,240 --> 02:51:33,240
no embers

2586
02:51:33,240 --> 02:51:35,240
no

2587
02:51:35,240 --> 02:51:37,240
sheepsters

2588
02:51:37,240 --> 02:51:39,240
is anyone coming up soon? Emmy should be on

2589
02:51:39,240 --> 02:51:41,240
the upstairs

2590
02:51:41,240 --> 02:51:43,240
unlucky coach

2591
02:51:43,240 --> 02:51:45,240
right

2592
02:51:45,240 --> 02:51:47,240
I

2593
02:51:47,240 --> 02:51:49,240
will

2594
02:51:49,240 --> 02:51:51,240
do into me because I actually

2595
02:51:51,240 --> 02:51:53,240
might have an ASMR collab with her

2596
02:51:53,240 --> 02:51:55,240
that one is for you

2597
02:51:55,240 --> 02:51:57,240
as a thank you

2598
02:51:57,240 --> 02:51:59,240
no one else until the collab which is a bit later

2599
02:51:59,240 --> 02:52:01,240
yeah

2600
02:52:01,240 --> 02:52:03,240
was a part of the only team that didn't win

2601
02:52:03,240 --> 02:52:05,240
kind of embarrassed

2602
02:52:05,240 --> 02:52:07,240
I am embarrassed Rieflin

2603
02:52:07,240 --> 02:52:09,240
I got really overwhelmed

2604
02:52:09,240 --> 02:52:11,240
at the end of that last fight

2605
02:52:11,240 --> 02:52:13,240
I have my crown see

2606
02:52:13,240 --> 02:52:15,240
I have my crown

2607
02:52:15,240 --> 02:52:17,240
but I had a lot of fun

2608
02:52:17,240 --> 02:52:19,240
it was so good

2609
02:52:19,240 --> 02:52:21,240
and I really enjoyed that

2610
02:52:21,240 --> 02:52:23,240
I can't wait to do that again

2611
02:52:23,240 --> 02:52:25,240
thank you to the members in particular

2612
02:52:25,240 --> 02:52:27,240
that are understanding I am delaying the chest

2613
02:52:27,240 --> 02:52:29,240
1v1

2614
02:52:29,240 --> 02:52:31,240
and tomorrow

2615
02:52:31,240 --> 02:52:33,240
we're playing Halo Combat

2616
02:52:33,240 --> 02:52:35,240
Evolved

2617
02:52:35,240 --> 02:52:37,240
my heart rate monitor has been on for ages

2618
02:52:37,240 --> 02:52:39,240
hold on let me take it off

2619
02:52:39,240 --> 02:52:41,240
you can listen to me take off my heart rate

2620
02:52:41,240 --> 02:52:43,240
monitor

2621
02:52:43,240 --> 02:52:45,240
but

2622
02:52:45,240 --> 02:52:47,240
yeah my heart rate was probably

2623
02:52:47,240 --> 02:52:49,240
way lower than it normally is

2624
02:52:49,240 --> 02:52:51,240
em

2625
02:52:51,240 --> 02:52:53,240
cause

2626
02:52:53,240 --> 02:52:55,240
yeah literally that was just like

2627
02:52:55,240 --> 02:52:57,240
a hoot and a holler and fun

2628
02:52:57,240 --> 02:52:59,240
oh sorry that was my heart rate monitor

2629
02:52:59,240 --> 02:53:01,240
it was like a

2630
02:53:01,240 --> 02:53:03,240
it was actually pretty

2631
02:53:04,240 --> 02:53:06,240
what was low for the stream sorry

2632
02:53:07,240 --> 02:53:09,240
the

2633
02:53:09,240 --> 02:53:11,240
oh my god I can't take off the fricking strap

2634
02:53:11,240 --> 02:53:13,240
get off of me

2635
02:53:13,240 --> 02:53:15,240
okay there I've got the strap I've got the strap

2636
02:53:15,240 --> 02:53:17,240
oh my heart was low for the stream

2637
02:53:17,240 --> 02:53:19,240
yeah literally like I felt so relaxed

2638
02:53:19,240 --> 02:53:21,240
and just playing with it

2639
02:53:21,240 --> 02:53:23,240
it's been like under 80

2640
02:53:23,240 --> 02:53:25,240
this is literally the most relaxed I've ever been on a stream

2641
02:53:25,240 --> 02:53:27,240
we're waiting till

2642
02:53:27,240 --> 02:53:29,240
I should have left the heart rate monitor on

2643
02:53:29,240 --> 02:53:31,240
and you'll see it speeds up right at the end stream

2644
02:53:31,240 --> 02:53:33,240
yay

2645
02:53:33,240 --> 02:53:35,240
you're cool under fire

2646
02:53:35,240 --> 02:53:37,240
I don't know if it went intense during Dead by Dailer

2647
02:53:37,240 --> 02:53:39,240
or not

2648
02:53:39,240 --> 02:53:41,240
relax gaming with moma

2649
02:53:41,240 --> 02:53:43,240
here with the strap

2650
02:53:43,240 --> 02:53:45,240
okay thank you so so much my little reef links

2651
02:53:45,240 --> 02:53:47,240
I'm gonna redirect into someone outside of Vealor as always

2652
02:53:47,240 --> 02:53:49,240
if they ain't one of us

2653
02:53:49,240 --> 02:53:51,240
do treat them with

2654
02:53:51,240 --> 02:53:53,240
as respect as you be

2655
02:53:53,240 --> 02:53:55,240
until you learn someone's kind of things you know

2656
02:53:55,240 --> 02:53:57,240
when you were hunting the girls it was

2657
02:53:57,240 --> 02:53:59,240
75

2658
02:53:59,240 --> 02:54:01,240
not me

2659
02:54:01,240 --> 02:54:03,240
I'm sure there's a limmy clip

2660
02:54:03,240 --> 02:54:05,240
of him playing the killer on Dead by Daylight

2661
02:54:05,240 --> 02:54:07,240
and his heart rate is like 4 or something

2662
02:54:07,240 --> 02:54:09,240
because he's so relaxed like running around

2663
02:54:09,240 --> 02:54:11,240
slashing people

2664
02:54:11,240 --> 02:54:13,240
that is funny as anything

2665
02:54:13,240 --> 02:54:15,240
thank you everyone as well for your patience

2666
02:54:15,240 --> 02:54:17,240
