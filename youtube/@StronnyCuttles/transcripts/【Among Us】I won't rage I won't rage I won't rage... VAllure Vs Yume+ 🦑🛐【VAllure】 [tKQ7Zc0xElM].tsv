192000	194000	where we are scuffed even through the beginning,
194000	196000	even though we met an hour before
196000	198000	and set this all up.
198000	200000	It was more than an hour.
200000	202000	It's giving poopy.
203000	205000	Speaking of poopy, let me go.
213000	215000	Alright poopy, take it away.
215000	218000	Take it away, take it away.

226000	228000	Yeah, nice to meet you.
228000	230000	Hi.

236000	239000	I'm rain and I'm the problem.

316000	318000	Bye.
318000	320000	Screw you guys.
320000	322000	I'm off to do the freaking alien thing.
322000	324000	No, I'm not.
326000	328000	Are you upset?
328000	330000	Did you hear?
330000	332000	Oh my god, she's good.
332000	334000	I need to do
334000	336000	the garbage shoot.
336000	338000	Hold on.
338000	340000	Are you guys okay?
340000	342000	You know, it's yourself, man.
342000	344000	I need the garbage.
344000	346000	Do you want to go do the
346000	348000	cars with me?
348000	350000	Three, two, one,
350000	352000	go!
354000	356000	Who's dead?
356000	358000	Can you hear them now?
358000	360000	It was Amy.
360000	362000	It was Amy.
362000	364000	Oh my gosh.
364000	366000	Amy's at the garbage shoot.
366000	368000	Amy's at the garbage shoot.
368000	370000	I literally just saw her.
370000	372000	I just came from communication.
372000	374000	And Amy is
374000	376000	standing over the body of rain.
376000	378000	Holy crap.
378000	380000	Holy crap.
380000	382000	No, don't even fucking lie.
382000	384000	I'm sorry, but you're into...
384000	386000	You didn't. Is that the best shot?
386000	388000	Sorry, if that's the best you've got.
388000	390000	That's the best you've got.
390000	392000	I walked in on it.
392000	394000	It's literally
394000	396000	Amy.
396000	398000	It's the Sonic Heroes.
398000	400000	Fucking Shadow Roleplayer.
400000	402000	Yeah, okay.
402000	404000	The only guilty thing I have
404000	406000	to admit is that I like Shadow,
406000	408000	but I didn't. I didn't do this.
408000	410000	I promise.
410000	412000	Can Strony set you up?
412000	414000	Yeah, absolutely.
414000	416000	Set you up? Are you fucking having a laugh?
416000	418000	Amy, are you joking?
418000	420000	I was literally at the gas canister
420000	422000	watching you as you got pulled over
422000	424000	and then fucking sniped
424000	426000	rain in half.
426000	428000	It's like left behind.
428000	430000	I'm sorry, but that was a cure...
430000	432000	Open up my stream.
432000	434000	Open up my stream right now.
434000	436000	I'm not being gas-lipped
436000	438000	by a Sonic...
438000	440000	a freaking Shadow the Hedgehog streamer
440000	442000	right now.
442000	444000	I am not being gas-lipped
444000	446000	by a Sonic the Hedgehog
446000	448000	stand.
448000	450000	You're getting done.
450000	452000	I will say that I did see
452000	454000	Amy stand over the body.
454000	456000	Amy immediately just being like
456000	458000	fuck you now, that's not fair.
458000	460000	I didn't do this.
460000	462000	I'm sorry, but you seem
462000	464000	suspicious.
464000	466000	Right now, believe me, my baby girl,
466000	468000	I would never, I would never
468000	470000	have to fly.
470000	472000	If it's not Amy, I'm voting
472000	474000	for Strony next round.
474000	476000	Wait, why am I getting in trouble?
476000	478000	Obviously, it's going to say imposter.
478000	480000	You're so passionate.
480000	482000	You're actually welcome for doing half of the work.
482000	484000	I'll go find the other imposter while you're at it.
484000	486000	I'll do it. I'll try my best.
486000	488000	Damn, Strony, I fucking love you.
490000	492000	Pigeonino?
492000	494000	I've heard the tune, but you don't give a damn.
494000	496000	See you in death, baby girl.
496000	498000	Wait, what?
506000	508000	Wait, you didn't do it!
508000	510000	You didn't do it!
510000	512000	Wait, she didn't do it!
512000	514000	Mother.
514000	516000	Mother.
516000	518000	Wait, wait, Mercy,
518000	520000	Mercy said she saw it.
520000	522000	Mercy reported.
522000	524000	I walked in.
524000	526000	I walked in.
526000	528000	I don't know about this.
528000	530000	What?
530000	532000	What? I just walked in.
532000	534000	I'm going to go do my shit.
534000	536000	If somebody kills me, it was Strony.
536000	538000	Wait, I'm not fucking doing it.
538000	540000	Mercy!
540000	542000	Mercy, no!
550000	552000	Guys, guys, I'm having a little issue.
558000	560000	You're cheating nasty whore.
564000	566000	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
566000	568000	I didn't see anything.
568000	570000	Hold on.
570000	572000	Can you guys hear me?
572000	574000	Yeah, can you use her?
574000	576000	I feel so betrayed, man.
578000	580000	Where are you?
580000	582000	My atoll.
582000	584000	We're so hurt by this development.
588000	590000	I didn't see anything.
590000	592000	In my defense, Amy, what kind of defense is I didn't do it?
592000	594000	You had no alibi.
594000	596000	Yeah.
596000	598000	The candlestick was in the lounge.
598000	600000	The billiard room had the freaking pool queue.
600000	602000	And it was like, what was that alibi?
602000	604000	I didn't do it.
604000	606000	Oh, we got a play pro punt on D mode.
606000	608000	Clue.
608000	610000	Clue reference.
610000	612000	That was horrible. I hated every second of that.
612000	614000	I love Shadow the Hedgehog.
614000	616000	Literally, I was like, I'm being accused
616000	618000	by a shadow the Hedgehog lover.
618000	620000	I don't know.
620000	622000	I mean, we can't let Sonic the Hedgehog
622000	624000	go down without fight.
624000	626000	It's not Sonic, it's Shadow!
626000	628000	Oh my god, please, get away!
628000	630000	Whatever the hell his name is, whatever the hell his name is.
630000	632000	They both begin with.
636000	638000	Oh, thank god.
638000	640000	Hopefully, this time, I'll actually be imposter.
640000	642000	I'm coming for you, Johnny.
642000	644000	If you're fucking coming for me, I'm coming up.
644000	646000	You, goodbye.
646000	648000	Oh, man.
650000	652000	I'll be a good little girl.
652000	654000	I'll do my test.
654000	656000	Okay, let's try it now.
656000	658000	Wait, where's the map?
658000	660000	Oh, where the fuck is the map?
660000	662000	I need to fix the wiring.
662000	664000	Why are they not highlighting it?
664000	666000	I need to do the asteroid.
666000	668000	Hey, Johnny.
668000	670000	You're pretty funny last round.
670000	672000	Ask the gun to move in that gaslight.
672000	674000	Right, we're playing gal.
674000	676000	Wait, why is the game sound so quiet?
676000	680000	Guys, I'm going to have to turn up the game sound, unfortunately.
680000	684000	Because that should not be making such a tiny little noise.
688000	690000	It's fine, it's fine.
690000	692000	Unlock manifolds.
692000	694000	A reactor, electrical, divert power to security.
694000	696000	Oh god, what is that?
696000	698000	Divert power?
698000	700000	Is he divert power?
700000	702000	Oh my god, I love the map.
702000	704000	The map, the map, the map.
704000	706000	Right, we're going to admin.
706000	708000	What do I report?
708000	710000	Oh, yes.
710000	712000	What the hell?
712000	714000	What the hell?
714000	716000	I was doing it.
716000	718000	I was doing it.
718000	720000	It shadowed the hedgehog.
720000	722000	Let me talk.
722000	724000	Okay, found the body.
724000	726000	Let the rabbit speak.
726000	728000	So I was doing electrical.
728000	730000	It was coming from electrical.
730000	732000	Actually, I don't know where the map works.
732000	734000	Hold on, let me look at the map.
734000	736000	You can open up the map.
736000	740000	I walked up near and in between reactor and security.
740000	742000	If that were the body.
742000	746000	I am going to vouch for Rhea in pink.
746000	748000	Because she was near me all the way in navigation.
748000	750000	I saw her go in the opposite direction.
750000	752000	So I think Rhea is fine.
752000	754000	Yeah, yeah, he coughed at me.
754000	758000	So Strony, Rhea and Mercy are vouching for one another.
758000	760000	Shebi is claiming she saw it.
760000	762000	So Azura, Mamosa and Rain, you all look in Suss's book.
762000	764000	What do you guys have to say for yourselves?
764000	766000	I have to say something.
766000	768000	I was in...
768000	770000	It was not me.
770000	772000	Because I saw...
772000	774000	How do we know?
774000	776000	How do we know it wasn't you?
776000	778000	Because I was with Strony.
778000	780000	Then I went to security and I saw what happened.
780000	782000	I didn't see who killed.
782000	784000	Well, it was in between security.
784000	786000	Yeah, but I...
786000	788000	It was in between security and Reactor.
788000	792000	No, I did see Rain and Admin.
792000	794000	So Azura and Mamosa are now the most likely suspects.
794000	796000	Unless Shebi, you're playing mind game.
796000	798000	So Azura, Mamosa and Shebi are all Suss now.
798000	802000	Unless Ventilation was taken in Electrical.
802000	804000	Which, unfortunately, I don't know.
804000	806000	I don't believe a word you say, Azura.
806000	810000	Well, I'm innocent.
810000	814000	I was sitting at the table.
814000	816000	I was sitting at the table because I'm having audio issues.
816000	818000	I can balance.
818000	820000	I can balance.
820000	822000	Okay.
822000	824000	I don't know who to vote for then.
824000	826000	I'm gonna vote for Mamosa.
826000	828000	Sorry, Mamosa, but you're the most likely target at the moment.
828000	830000	Okay.
830000	832000	Wait, who was the person that said they walked to security?
832000	834000	I'm gonna skip because I don't know who to vote for.
834000	836000	It was me.
836000	838000	Azura and Mamosa have abstained from voting.
838000	840000	How fucking curious.
840000	842000	I'm just wondering.
842000	848000	What do you guys do?
848000	850000	What do I do to you?
850000	852000	Right, let's find out.
852000	854000	Mamosa was an imposter.
854000	858000	Azura is the most fucking likely.
858000	860000	I'm keeping an eye on her.
860000	862000	It's impossible.
862000	864000	But they're no fucking getting me in these mind games.
864000	866000	I know how these games work.
866000	868000	I'm fucking energetic.
868000	870000	What happens is the lights are off and they don't work.
870000	872000	Wait.
872000	874000	Whoa.
874000	876000	One, two, three, four.
876000	878000	Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
878000	880000	Oh my god, I'm so smart.
880000	882000	Electrical.
882000	886000	More like, electricate my music.
886000	888000	Mommy's been so aggressive.
888000	890000	I think it's the lights.
890000	892000	Okay, look. Thank you.
892000	894000	Unless it's Mercy, I bet.
894000	896000	What?
896000	898000	Why?
898000	900000	It's not me.
900000	902000	It's not me.
902000	904000	It's not me.
904000	906000	It's not me.
906000	908000	She's getting nervous.
908000	910000	She's getting nervous.
910000	912000	It's not working.
912000	914000	I think it's rain.
914000	916000	Yeah, it's rain.
916000	918000	It's not rain.
918000	920000	So it's both.
920000	922000	Right.
922000	924000	We do kind of need to breathe oxygen.
924000	926000	Not going to lie.
926000	928000	We need a cheeky bit of oxygen.
928000	930000	Very fucking curious.
934000	936000	It wasn't.
936000	938000	Wait a moment.
938000	940000	Who was attacking you?
940000	942000	It's fucking Mercy.
942000	944000	Oh my god, guys.
944000	946000	Mercy walked by me and disappeared into the nether.
946000	948000	I do believe it might be her.
948000	950000	No, I was walking too.
950000	952000	What was the area on the left?
952000	954000	I was right next to you when you
954000	956000	I was alone
956000	958000	with Rain and Rea
958000	960000	and Strawny.
960000	962000	I was with
962000	964000	Rain. I think it was Rain.
964000	966000	Yeah, it was Rain.
966000	968000	It's Mercy.
968000	970000	No, it's not.
970000	972000	It's freaking you.
972000	974000	No, it's not. I can't believe you would do such a thing to me.
976000	978000	Oh, is there, I'm sorry.
978000	980000	Oh, okay.
980000	982000	It would make sense
982000	984000	why Mercy would vote.
984000	986000	Oh.
986000	988000	Oh!
988000	990000	Yay!
990000	992000	Yeah, let's go!
992000	994000	Oh, fantastic.
994000	996000	Game play, fucking flow.
996000	998000	I actually like to approve it
998000	1000000	because the pressure of being a poster is hard.
1000000	1002000	I'm sorry.
1004000	1006000	I probably could have killed.
1006000	1008000	Mercy walked right past me
1008000	1010000	and I'm surprised you didn't kill me then
1010000	1012000	because I was just talking to myself
1012000	1014000	with a weirdo.
1014000	1016000	I just wanted to.
1016000	1018000	I wanted to let you all live.
1018000	1020000	I'm sorry.
1020000	1022000	Look at me being so kind as an imposter,
1022000	1024000	letting you live.
1024000	1026000	You're not kind.
1026000	1028000	I'm not accepted.
1028000	1030000	I'm red, not blue, goddamn.
1030000	1032000	Jesus.
1032000	1034000	I'm lying. I forgive you.
1034000	1036000	I can never be mad.
1036000	1038000	All right.
1038000	1040000	Do my task and shake my hand.
1040000	1042000	Hi, I'm with garbage shooters.
1042000	1044000	Garbage shooters.
1044000	1046000	I'm sorry about last time.
1050000	1052000	Please don't kill me.
1052000	1054000	We're doing the garbage shoot boys.
1054000	1056000	Taking out the garbage.
1060000	1062000	I don't know what any of this stuff is.
1062000	1064000	I'm going to be honest.
1064000	1066000	I'm scared.
1066000	1068000	This is closed. I'm so scared.
1068000	1070000	Oh, there you go.
1070000	1072000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
1072000	1074000	Why are you...
1074000	1076000	You're fine.
1076000	1078000	You're fine.
1078000	1080000	I'm traumatized.
1086000	1088000	Hold on a minute.
1088000	1090000	Amy is in
1090000	1092000	fucking electrical
1092000	1094000	and who does something upon?
1094000	1096000	Who are we? Ria's dead body again.
1096000	1098000	Oh, no.
1098000	1100000	She's a victim.
1100000	1102000	I literally opened the door
1102000	1104000	because the door just got closed in my face.
1104000	1106000	Me and...
1106000	1108000	I'm fucking on the outside.
1108000	1110000	And then Amy comes out
1110000	1112000	and then I go in to the back of the vent section
1112000	1114000	and Ria's sitting dead with her retort.
1114000	1116000	No, listen.
1116000	1118000	Amy,
1118000	1120000	do you have to say for yourself?
1120000	1122000	Did you tell me to kill myself?
1122000	1124000	No, what do you have to say for yourself?
1124000	1126000	Not that.
1126000	1128000	I mean, if you want to...
1128000	1130000	I can't stop you.
1130000	1132000	I was doing electricals.
1132000	1134000	Yes, you were because that's where you killed her.
1134000	1136000	She just admitted.
1136000	1138000	She just admitted.
1138000	1140000	She was...
1140000	1142000	Strony, I think you're making money.
1142000	1144000	Strony, when you get like this...
1144000	1146000	Strony, when you get like this...
1146000	1148000	No, because I know...
1148000	1150000	Wait, no.
1150000	1152000	When Strony came and opened the door,
1152000	1154000	I screamed because you scared me.
1154000	1156000	No, listen to...
1156000	1158000	Listen to Amy.
1158000	1160000	She literally goes.
1160000	1162000	She literally goes.
1162000	1164000	I was in electrical.
1164000	1166000	It's like breaking her microphone.
1166000	1168000	She literally goes.
1168000	1170000	She literally goes.
1170000	1172000	I was in electrical.
1172000	1174000	I tell you, I find the dead body of Rhea in electrical
1174000	1176000	and you go, oh, it's Strony.
1176000	1178000	I'm abstaining.
1178000	1180000	All right, then.
1180000	1182000	All right, then.
1182000	1184000	She goes, I'm in electrical.
1184000	1186000	I like how nobody's questioning us.
1186000	1188000	I know it's Amy.
1188000	1190000	Wait, wait.
1190000	1192000	I don't know.
1192000	1194000	If it's Amy, it also might be Mamosa
1194000	1196000	because Mamosa was cornering me
1196000	1198000	and she saw them walking together.
1198000	1200000	I was chilling with you.
1200000	1202000	No, I have not seen Azura.
1202000	1204000	Where's her body?
1204000	1206000	Probably by the table again.
1206000	1208000	Probably by the table.
1208000	1210000	She got the table.
1210000	1212000	I saw Azura talking.
1212000	1214000	I saw Azura talking.
1214000	1216000	I saw Azura talking.
1216000	1218000	It was rain.
1218000	1220000	Excuse me, what was that, Marcy?
1220000	1222000	Wait, who?
1222000	1224000	Who the fuck is for me?
1224000	1226000	Marcy.
1226000	1228000	Marcy's voting for me.
1228000	1230000	I'm so sorry.

1258000	1260000	No, Marcy's voting for me.
1260000	1262000	So when you see me floating in space
1262000	1264000	and I can't even play the game.
1264000	1266000	It's Marcy.
1266000	1267600	When it goes, oh, when
1267600	1270000	when床y is in Poster,

1276000	1278000	Wait, no, Marcy always
1278000	1280000	votes for the person that accuses her

1500920	1504480	Right who's dead as there came from here. So there's a dead body in here. It's a zero
1505040	1507040	Right, but there's no dead body

4316300	4317300	Oh
4318300	4319300	You're gonna marry me
4319300	4320300	I forgot
4320300	4322300	She has like an actual place to live
4322300	4324300	And doesn't live in her basement like me
4324300	4326300	I like how her kitchen is right next to her desk
4326300	4327300	That's cool
4327300	4329300	I want food right next to me all the time
4329300	4330300	Honestly Rhea was too good
4330300	4332300	I like believed her
4332300	4333300	I believed her
4333300	4335300	Rhea you're so freaking innocent
4335300	4336300	She's such a good liar
4336300	4338300	You're capable of anything
4338300	4341300	She doesn't even like change the tone of her voice
4341300	4343300	You're just so innocent
4345300	4348300	You didn't change your tone of voice at all
4348300	4349300	When lying
4349300	4351300	Oh why is my peeing dancing like that
4351300	4353300	You see that I went all the way up to 300
4353300	4355300	Mane's at 200 by default
4355300	4357300	Never trust Rhea
4357300	4358300	I can't tell
4358300	4360300	She's one of the few people I can't tell
4360300	4362300	You can tell really good mercy
4362300	4364300	You caught on to me
4364300	4366300	My mouth is dry
4366300	4368300	I'm sorry Rain
4368300	4370300	I just noticed your voice
4370300	4372300	Thank you Shibbe
4372300	4374300	My mouth is dry
4376300	4378300	I believed her to the end as well
4378300	4381300	Get ass I believed Raina to the end
4381300	4383300	I can never tell if she's a fanatic
4383300	4385300	Is she ever lying or not
4385300	4388300	I can never tell if she's lying or not
4388300	4391300	I can tell because she's real defensive
4391300	4398300	Every time you don't let someone finish
4398300	4400300	It feels like you're being defensive
4400300	4402300	And not letting the person speak
4402300	4403300	So you're deflecting
4403300	4405300	So I assume that you're the
4405300	4407300	You gotta let me
4407300	4409300	You gotta let me explain
4409300	4411300	Because you're lying
4411300	4413300	Fight fight fight
4415300	4417300	You gotta let me explain why
4417300	4420300	And then you have to tell me why I'm wrong
4420300	4422300	Honestly if you listen to what I know
4422300	4424300	I'm gonna go through it that way
4424300	4426300	Because you voted too quickly
4426300	4427300	So let me
4427300	4429300	Well yeah because you didn't let me speak
4429300	4431300	Honestly I wanted to
4431300	4432300	I wanted to
4432300	4434300	I thought scrawny was suspicious anyways
4434300	4436300	It just feels good
4436300	4437300	It's super sad
4437300	4438300	What am I gonna do?
4438300	4440300	Right, scrawny is suspicious
4440300	4441300	I see how it is
4441300	4442300	That's it, you'll get that
4442300	4444300	That's it, I'll be your member
4444300	4445300	It's funny
4445300	4446300	It's suspicious
4446300	4449300	It's a 40 days, no pain
4449300	4450300	It's what they deserve
4450300	4451300	A 40 days
4451300	4452300	What they deserve
4452300	4454300	40 days, 20 nights
4454300	4455300	You make push scrawny
4455300	4456300	You're a really good guy
4456300	4457300	You're the cold suspension
4457300	4458300	We're not gonna lie
4458300	4460300	You're really good at gaslighting
4460300	4461300	So I'll say one thing
4461300	4463300	The girls have never seen me
4463300	4465300	At any other type of motion
4465300	4466300	They're more than happy
4466300	4467300	And proud of their work
4467300	4468300	So playing among us
4468300	4470300	When I'm screaming down the make
4470300	4472300	Being like, it's fucking da

4487300	4488300	Or scrawny and Rhea team up
4488300	4489300	That's what I wanna see
4489300	4490300	That'd be funny
4490300	4491300	Scrawny and Rhea
4491300	4493300	I haven't gotten imposter once
4493300	4494300	You've not been imposter?
4494300	4496300	Yeah, guys, let's give Azura a chance
4496300	4497300	Okay
4497300	4498300	Let's give Azura imposter

4512300	4514300	This is how I get killed
4514300	4516300	They're all fine to mess with
4516300	4518300	I'm eating goldfish
4518300	4519300	I'm eating goldfish
4519300	4521300	A snack that smiles best
4521300	4522300	That's a regular kind of goldfish
4522300	4523300	She says scrawny
4523300	4525300	Because she says the suss is shit ever

4647300	4648300	I just know it's Strani
4648300	4650300	Bro, you fucking...
4650300	4651300	Wait, hold on a minute
4651300	4652300	Hold on a minute
4652300	4655300	I say who's been near weapons O2 navigation
4655300	4657300	Because you have reported the body
4657300	4658300	And where O2
4658300	4660300	And you automatically go to Strani
4660300	4661300	Sorry
4661300	4662300	I know you love playing these mind games
4662300	4664300	Being like, Strani, Strani, Strani
4664300	4665300	But get to...
4665300	4666300	No, no, no, no
4666300	4667300	You're the only one
4667300	4668300	It's Strani
4668300	4669300	It's fucking she
4669300	4670300	I mean, hold on
4670300	4671300	It's Strani
4671300	4672300	No, no, no, no
4672300	4673300	Hold on, hold on, hold on
4673300	4674300	Wait, hold on
4674300	4675300	Notice how I'm nice and calm
4675300	4676300	And she's freaking out
4676300	4677300	And that's all I'm gonna say
4677300	4678300	I'm reaching on me when you
4678300	4679300	Self-reported the body
4679300	4680300	When you're the only person
4680300	4683300	Who's been witnessing weapons O2 navigation
4683300	4684300	Fucking rain
4684300	4686300	Clearly because the body was there
4686300	4687300	For a lot longer
4687300	4688300	Yeah, it could be both
4688300	4690300	The body must have been there for a while
4690300	4691300	Because no one else has been there
4691300	4692300	No one said anything
4692300	4693300	I was feeling the cafeteria
4693300	4694300	Talking to my cat
4694300	4695300	Literally all of them
4695300	4696300	And then I went and shot some asteroids
4696300	4697300	It could be Imi
4697300	4698300	Hold on, hold on, hold on
4698300	4699300	I mean, who were you with again?
4699300	4701300	I was with Reia and Strani
4701300	4702300	Was in the room with us
4702300	4703300	When we swapped the cards
4703300	4704300	Yeah, I was with Amy
4704300	4705300	In the admin room
4705300	4706300	Yeah
4706300	4707300	Did you see Reia's body?
4707300	4708300	No, I didn't
4708300	4709300	No, I didn't
4709300	4710300	No, because she was alive
4710300	4711300	And then when she walked off
4711300	4712300	And then that's...
4712300	4714300	And then I was singing a song
4714300	4715300	Going somewhere else
4715300	4716300	Aw
4716300	4717300	And then...
4717300	4718300	I don't know
4718300	4719300	I don't know
4719300	4720300	I don't know
4720300	4721300	I don't know
4721300	4723300	I was walking to the med bay
4723300	4724300	And the round goes fast
4724300	4725300	It's Strani
4725300	4726300	Because Strani kills fast
4726300	4727300	What do you mean?
4727300	4728300	You're not...
4728300	4729300	Right
4729300	4730300	No, she could not see
4730300	4731300	I don't even know that
4731300	4732300	Thank you
4732300	4733300	Thank you
4733300	4734300	Thank you
4734300	4735300	Oh my god
4735300	4736300	Don't ever fucking...
4736300	4737300	Anyways, we're...
4737300	4738300	I'm scared
4738300	4739300	I'm scared
4739300	4740300	I'm scared
4741300	4742300	Now she's shooting at us
4742300	4743300	Okay, goodbye
4743300	4745300	Imi is lost
4745300	4746300	Hi
4746300	4747300	Hi
4747300	4748300	What did I say?
4748300	4749300	She's a gas voter
4749300	4750300	She's a gas voter
4750300	4751300	Can we ban her, please?
4751300	4752300	She's a gas voter
4752300	4753300	Damn you
4753300	4755300	I thought she banned her
4755300	4756300	I'm a gas voter
4756300	4757300	I'm a gas voter
4757300	4758300	Damn, I'm a gas voter
4758300	4759300	I'm a gas voter
4759300	4760300	Why does it keep making me blue?
4760300	4763300	The moment she starts getting defensive and loud
4763300	4765300	She is the impostor
4765300	4766300	She's the blue nation
4766300	4768300	Sheebie, give me the benefit of the day
4768300	4770300	You're the only person in that area
4770300	4771300	Oh my god
4771300	4773300	I killed her long ago in that area
4773300	4774300	No, that's what I mean
4774300	4777300	I'm like, I had to have happened long ago
4777300	4779300	I can't believe mommy would do this
4779300	4780300	I'm sorry about that, love
4780300	4781300	I can't believe
4781300	4782300	I wasn't planning to kill you
4782300	4783300	I didn't know
4783300	4784300	Look, look
4784300	4785300	Listen, listen
4785300	4786300	Are you serious?
4786300	4787300	Are you serious?
4787300	4788300	Are you serious?
4788300	4789300	Are you serious?
4789300	4790300	Are you serious?
4790300	4791300	Are you serious?
4791300	4792300	I wish you guys could see all the gesturing
4792300	4793300	that I'm doing right now
4793300	4794300	I knew it was you twice
4794300	4795300	I did it
4795300	4796300	Honestly, you did
4796300	4797300	I will know
4797300	4798300	She'll eat a bowl of fish
4798300	4799300	You are evil
4799300	4800300	No, I'll never be the next one
4800300	4801300	I didn't cover up
4801300	4802300	I gave you some of my chances to run away
4802300	4803300	but you kept running
4803300	4804300	I mean, a gas-riding car
4804300	4805300	When the killing goes fast
4805300	4806300	and when she gets defensive
4806300	4807300	you know what's wrong
4807300	4808300	You said that we'd double all
4808300	4809300	You said that we'd double all
4809300	4810300	No, to be fair
4810300	4811300	you were the one
4811300	4819300	I'm sorry. Press the button. Thank you. Rain starts accusing her own teammates. It's rain.
4819300	4827300	Please, I want you to feel like craved blood. I'm not fighting each other. Craved blood and death.
4827300	4835300	I tend to accuse my teammates all the time. That's just her strass to kill her teammates.
4835300	4843300	I'm going to get blamed this round as well. She's hanging about over here.
4843300	4847300	Oh no, don't die. You're so hot.
4847300	4859300	I'm doing the card. I don't have anything here. I'm scared.
4859300	4863300	Are you needing pals just to get through the game? Because it's too scary.
4863300	4865300	I'm probably going to get double gold.
4865300	4867300	That's terrifying.
4867300	4869300	They keep targeting me.
4877300	4883300	It's so accusatory.
4883300	4885300	Hello, press the button to start.
4885300	4889300	Did I just close that?
4889300	4895300	And you've got all the way to freaking electrical mode.
4895300	4899300	Who the frick is talking? I can hear someone but I don't see anyone.
4899300	4901300	I'm losing out.
4901300	4903300	Did I not just hear someone?
4903300	4907300	This kid's friendly. I need my medication.
4907300	4911300	I literally am seeing no one.
4911300	4919300	It's not either of us.
4919300	4923300	I want everyone to tell me their location right now.
4923300	4925300	I was sniffing Shuby.
4925300	4931300	She was. I was doing the beds or whatever it's called.
4931300	4933300	It's not Azura. I promise you.
4933300	4937300	Open up the map and tell me where you are.
4937300	4941300	It's Mercy. I saw her run off with Rhea.
4941300	4943300	Why did you just say that right now Amy?
4943300	4947300	I just remembered because I was laughing about sniffing Shuby.
4947300	4951300	I saw her rain.
4951300	4953300	It's not me guys.
4953300	4957300	Are you kidding me?
4957300	4961300	I'm not saying it's you. I'm saying it's rain.
4961300	4965300	Let me vouch for people. It's not Azura or Shuby.
4965300	4967300	I'm vouching for people right now.
4967300	4971300	It's definitely because Shuby was following me and then I was following Azura.
4971300	4975300	Then Amy was sniffing my ass.
4975300	4977300	I was doing the leaves.
4977300	4979300	I don't want to ditch my gen.
4979300	4981300	I don't want to accuse my gen.
4981300	4983300	You're a little bit quieter than you usually are.
4983300	4985300	Johnny, why are you so quiet?
4985300	4987300	It's rain. It's rain.
4987300	4989300	It's rain. It's rain.
4989300	4991300	Everyone has ignored my question.
4991300	4995300	Everyone identify your location on the map right now.
4995300	4999300	I'm in storage with my fellow cafeteria.
4999300	5001300	We're on our way to cafeteria.
5001300	5003300	Someone's in cafeteria.
5003300	5005300	Me and Shuby.
5005300	5007300	I was in storage with Amy.
5007300	5009300	Me, Amy.
5009300	5011300	So then Mercy and Amy then?
5011300	5013300	No.
5013300	5015300	I was literally with Shuby.
5015300	5019300	I will only say that I was not with rain the entire time.
5019300	5021300	But then Shuby was with me the other half.
5021300	5025300	The other half I was not with rain.
5025300	5029300	I don't know if it's rain or Amy.
5029300	5031300	I don't know if it's rain or Amy.
5031300	5033300	I don't know if it's rain or Amy.
5033300	5035300	I don't know.
5035300	5037300	I think it's Mercy.
5037300	5039300	Why?
5039300	5041300	I think it's Mercy and Amy.
5041300	5043300	Trust me.
5043300	5045300	Trust me.
5045300	5047300	I'm voting rain.
5047300	5049300	I don't know.
5049300	5051300	I swear to God.
5051300	5053300	It wasn't me.
5053300	5055300	It wasn't me.
5055300	5057300	It wasn't me.
5057300	5059300	I'm going to hold your hand the whole time.
5059300	5061300	I would like to also mention
5061300	5063300	Mercy did not defend herself
5063300	5065300	once during that execution.
5065300	5067300	Please keep that in mind.
5067300	5069300	It's Mercy.
5069300	5071300	It's Mercy and Amy.
5071300	5073300	I don't know.
5073300	5075300	It's freaking Mercy and Amy.
5075300	5077300	I don't know, man.
5077300	5079300	I don't know, man.
5079300	5081300	I don't know, man.
5081300	5083300	I am not.
5083300	5085300	My mic is not picking up as normal.
5085300	5087300	Maybe I was listening to it wrong.
5091300	5093300	Get to fuck you.
5093300	5095300	Get to fuck you're an electrical.
5095300	5097300	Get to fuck!
5097300	5099300	I knew it.
5099300	5101300	Anyway, I can complete my task as a ghost.
5103300	5105300	I was like, yeah, right.
5105300	5107300	You're an electrical.
5107300	5109300	I freaking doubt it.
5109300	5111300	I'm going to defend Ezra.
5111300	5113300	Trust.
5113300	5115300	Trust.
5115300	5117300	You need to pop that button.
5117300	5119300	Unless it's Ezra, just doing a big switch.
5119300	5121300	I'm going to...
5121300	5123300	Oh, my God.
5123300	5125300	What is going on?
5125300	5127300	What is going on?
5127300	5129300	You can follow it.
5129300	5131300	Yeah.
5131300	5133300	I'm going to Mercy.
5133300	5135300	I'm going to Mercy.
5135300	5137300	I'm going to Mercy.
5143300	5145300	I love you a little, but I knew it was Mercy, too.
5145300	5147300	I had a feeling.
5147300	5149300	I won't continue to gas like you!
5149300	5155300	When Stronny said that Mercy was quiet, that's when I knew, I was like, oh, oh, look who's low-toed now.
5155300	5157300	I knew it was no octave.
5157300	5159300	I didn't get a chance to save you.
5159300	5161300	If I get changed to blue one more time.
5161300	5163300	I saw Mercy, Mercy was the last person.
5163300	5165300	About to kill.
5165300	5168300	Mercy, I'd like to abide my time.
5168300	5173300	I knew it was Mercy because Mercy was the last one with Rhea and I was trying to tell you guys that.
5173300	5176300	No, I know you're sipping the ass of a killer.
5176300	5179300	She was following me, following Azura.
5179300	5182300	You were following me, following Azura, makes sense now.
5182300	5188300	Because I was hoping that Mercy would read my mind and we would do a double, but it didn't happen.
5188300	5192300	Sorry, my mind play was to make my sound look more suspicious than everyone else.
5192300	5194300	I don't trust the rabbit guys, man.
5194300	5197300	Well, I don't trust the, what are you, a princess?
5197300	5199300	I'm a rain cloud, man.
5199300	5202300	This is straight up rain cloud!
5203300	5209300	What is a different rain cloud called? A cumulative member?
5209300	5212300	Oh, actually, I didn't mind that task.
5212300	5215300	That was rather cute. I found that one rather.
5215300	5217300	No, it's hot.
5217300	5220300	Okay, it's hot when I'm actually screaming and rage.
5220300	5223300	Oh, nothing does my, nothing really inverts my nipples.
5223300	5225300	Like being falsely accused of being impulsive.
5225300	5227300	I don't trust Rhea, but still.
5227300	5231300	Like, it literally, oh my god, it doesn't mean so much.
5231300	5236300	So I was actually going to do, I'm just going to trust that everyone else goes and does that.
5236300	5239300	Because I think everyone's quite altruistic in the team.
5239300	5245300	So I'm going to just focus on getting the task done like ASAP so I can get the,
5245300	5249300	and before we run out of oxygen because of my lack of judgement.
5249300	5252300	She's pretending! She's pretending to do it!
5252300	5256300	Is no one doing oxygen or whatever the task is?
5256300	5258300	I was trying to do oxygen!
5258300	5260300	How come no one's doing the freakin' challenge, you guys?
5260300	5262300	Why don't no one do the other one?
5262300	5264300	What? Are you shitting me?
5264300	5266300	What? Are you okay?
5266300	5268300	Reed, are you literate?
5268300	5270300	What are you doing?
5270300	5272300	Hello?
5272300	5274300	Are you okay?
5274300	5276300	Are you?
5276300	5278300	Dude.
5278300	5282300	Legally, being legally blind is a skill issue.
5282300	5285300	Yeah, sabotage. You're supposed to fix it.
5285300	5287300	Dude, that was good.
5287300	5289300	Not as skill as you.
5289300	5292300	I just assumed everyone else was going to do it and I can't work in to be honest.
5292300	5294300	Keep yourself safe!
5294300	5296300	I sabotaged nothing.
5296300	5298300	I thought you were pretending to do it.
5298300	5301300	Wait, we don't have our 8th! We don't have our 8th!
5301300	5303300	Are we all here?
5303300	5304300	Are we good?
5304300	5305300	Yeah, we're here now.
5305300	5306300	We got our 8th.
5306300	5307300	Oh my god.
5307300	5309300	Alright, that scared me. Sorry.
5311300	5313300	All of it here.
5314300	5317300	I don't want to be a monster anymore.
5317300	5319300	Bro, please! I want to be a monster!
5321300	5324300	Dude, I've been a monster like what five times already is crazy.
5324300	5326300	Tell me about it.
5327300	5329300	Where do you go?
5329300	5331300	Oh, Midway.
5335300	5340300	Okay, Rhea now has a plausible motive because
5340300	5342300	she corrected her course.
5342300	5346300	So, perhaps not too sassy for Latuvia.
5348300	5349300	That worked you.
5349300	5351300	You were about to vent.
5351300	5353300	Swear to god.
5353300	5354300	I have a scan.
5354300	5356300	I have a scan. Who wants to watch me do a scan?
5356300	5358300	Watch you do a scan, Rhea.
5358300	5359300	Yeah, I have.
5359300	5360300	Who wants to watch me do a scan?
5360300	5361300	You have to.
5361300	5363300	Who wants to watch the scan?
5363300	5365300	I don't want to get the power.
5365300	5367300	Anyone want to watch a scan?
5367300	5368300	Only three people.
5368300	5370300	I'm doing security then.
5370300	5372300	I don't want to be mercy.
5372300	5374300	I don't want to be any kind.
5374300	5376300	I haven't seen Mercy.
5376300	5378300	I don't know if anyone's got eyes on Mercy.
5378300	5380300	The serial killer of Viola.
5380300	5381300	Maybe she died.
5381300	5383300	I actually don't see her.
5383300	5385300	I've not seen her.
5388300	5390300	Okay, there's five of us. It's fine.
5390300	5392300	There's five of us. It's fine.
5392300	5394300	I'm scanning.
5395300	5397300	Is she scanning?
5397300	5399300	Okay.
5401300	5403300	Mercy just kills her.
5403300	5405300	She just kills her.
5405300	5407300	She just kills her.
5407300	5409300	Rhea, wait.
5409300	5411300	Hold on.
5411300	5413300	Rhea, why did you walk right past that?
5413300	5415300	Because I was coming out of the scan.
5415300	5417300	I was coming out of the scan.
5417300	5419300	No, no, no. Rhea's fine.
5419300	5421300	I watched your scan.
5421300	5423300	I watched Mercy kill.
5423300	5425300	After we all came out of bed.
5425300	5427300	I was on the scan.
5427300	5429300	I was on the scan.
5429300	5431300	I saw Azura coming out of the scan.
5431300	5433300	I killed Strawny.
5433300	5435300	She made kills.
5435300	5437300	Why would you do that?
5437300	5439300	She just made kills.
5439300	5441300	Where did you find Rhea?
5441300	5443300	She was in Med Bake.
5443300	5445300	I watched her do a scan.
5445300	5447300	With Strawny.
5447300	5449300	And then Mercy kills.
5449300	5451300	It's not Azura. I'm just vouching for her.
5451300	5453300	I saw Azura walk in that direction.
5453300	5455300	I'm gonna ask her whatever it's called.
5455300	5457300	It's the navigation. I think she's fine.
5459300	5461300	Think...
5461300	5463300	It's Mercy.
5465300	5469300	I'm gonna be really upset because I-
5469300	5471300	Why did you report her body?
5471300	5473300	You walked right past it Mercy.
5473300	5475300	I did it.
5475300	5477300	Mercy you're terrible.
5479300	5481300	It's Mimosa and Mercy.
5481300	5487000	I don't know. I think it's you
5487040	5490140	in the body. I was I was the
5490180	5491480	one who reported it. I wasn't
5491540	5494620	there. Yeah. No, Mamosa's fine.
5494680	5497640	Mamosa's fine. I did it. I
5497720	5500720	did it. I did it. I did it.
5500780	5504920	I did it. I ran to Mamosa in
5504980	5508360	fear. Yeah, you vote for
5509120	5511960	how does it fatal mating
5512020	5516640	girly Pop that's why she's
5521440	5524380	Nothing's is going on. We
5524440	5528440	don't have to worry about a
5528520	5535120	Are you sure I mean you were
5535180	5537620	forgive you because you didn'
5537620	5540620	your collaboration.
5540620	5543620	Your collaboration to figure it out is Rhea.
5543620	5546620	Rhea is a you.
5546620	5549620	No, but I skinned.
5549620	5552620	Your pitch raised a little bit when you said that.
5552620	5554620	If I was lying, my pitch wouldn't change.
5554620	5557620	And she'd be watching me skin.
5557620	5559620	Yeah, Rhea is fine.
5559620	5561620	Rhea is cool.
5561620	5564620	I mean, Red Bay, um,
5564620	5574620	I have no idea who the other person is, I'm not skilled enough to know, but I'm glad everyone's enjoying my gameplay.
5574620	5576620	Yeah, I'm sorry to say I haven't sabotaged.
5582620	5584620	She's focused, she's locked in.
5586620	5590620	It's not me, I promise. I'm just sussing you out a little bit.
5590620	5592620	I don't know.
5592620	5594620	Hopefully.
5594620	5596620	Listen, it's one of the joes, it's Mercy Rosa, I bet.
5596620	5598620	One of the joes.
5598620	5600620	Mercy, go call and just retake me.
5600620	5602620	Mita!
5602620	5604620	It's not me!
5604620	5606620	It's just one of the joes.
5610620	5612620	Wait, is it rain?
5612620	5614620	No, it's not.
5614620	5616620	Oh my god, no, it's not.
5616620	5618620	Alright, go on.
5618620	5620620	Shibi, it's not.
5620620	5622620	Do it, do it, do it.
5622620	5624620	It's not me, it's not me.
5624620	5626620	It's Imi, she's gonna do it.
5626620	5628620	It's not!
5628620	5630620	Wait, what if you do it in the other person's report?
5630620	5632620	Fine, go do it rain, go on.
5632620	5634620	No, you do it, you do it, it's you.
5634620	5636620	I can't kill other people's stuff.
5636620	5638620	Go on then, show what you mean.
5638620	5640620	I'm gonna check on Azera and Rhea then.
5640620	5642620	Oh my god.
5646620	5648620	Oh my god.
5648620	5650620	I've been on fuck.
5650620	5652620	Just meant to kill someone.
5652620	5654620	No, look, it's Azera or Rhea.
5654620	5656620	Look, the three of us will stick together, promise.
5656620	5658620	Where's Azera?
5658620	5660620	That's what I'm saying.
5660620	5662620	Oh, I gotta go back to Midnight, just FYI.
5662620	5664620	What?
5664620	5666620	Whispering to yourself, Azera.
5666620	5668620	Yeah, yeah.
5668620	5670620	See it?
5670620	5672620	No way.
5672620	5674620	Why were you whispering?
5674620	5676620	You sounded weird.
5676620	5678620	You said, where did she go?
5678620	5680620	Where did she go?
5680620	5682620	That's what I said.
5682620	5684620	I asked Rhea, where did she go?
5684620	5686620	Amy, are we killing?
5686620	5688620	Or did she actually go, it might be like...
5688620	5690620	No.
5690620	5692620	No.
5696620	5698620	Oh, I don't need that.
5698620	5700620	Hi, Mims.
5700620	5702620	We're not talking?
5702620	5704620	We're not talking?
5704620	5706620	I don't know about that.
5706620	5708620	I just don't know about that.
5708620	5710620	I don't know, I don't know.
5710620	5712620	I haven't checked Electrical in a while.
5712620	5714620	Maybe somebody died.
5714620	5716620	Maybe somebody died in Electrical.
5716620	5718620	Let me check it out.
5718620	5720620	Honestly, Momosa's pretty smart, though.
5720620	5722620	If anything, you're probably gonna die in there.
5722620	5724620	No, dude, can somebody fucking kill somebody damn?
5724620	5726620	If it's you, Azera.
5726620	5728620	It's ending.
5728620	5730620	Probably Mims, I don't know.
5730620	5732620	I'm just accusing everyone.
5732620	5734620	It's a double take, but then she realized somebody was nearby.
5734620	5736620	Hmm.
5736620	5738620	You could tell somebody this information.
5738620	5740620	Okay, I'm gonna tell you something.
5740620	5742620	In case I die.
5742620	5744620	No.
5744620	5746620	It might be Momosa, because she did a double take,
5746620	5748620	but then she saw Rhea was nearby.
5748620	5750620	Oh, my God.
5750620	5752620	It's Amy.
5752620	5754620	It's Amy.
5754620	5756620	Yes, Amy.
5756620	5758620	Oh, my God.
5758620	5760620	Oh, my God.
5760620	5762620	Okay, well, it's not Momosa.
5762620	5764620	I just have an act for these sort of things.
5764620	5766620	What can I say?
5766620	5768620	Because she didn't accuse me even though I was seen on the TV.
5768620	5770620	Oh, no.
5770620	5772620	Rain was with me.
5772620	5774620	Rain was with me.
5774620	5776620	Yeah, I was with everyone.
5776620	5778620	Rain over to Rain to tell her that I thought it was Momosa.
5778620	5780620	It's not.
5780620	5782620	Because she's dead.
5782620	5784620	Momosa did a double take, and I thought she's gonna kill me.
5784620	5786620	Momosa did a double take, and I thought she's gonna kill me.
5786620	5788620	Momosa did a double take, and I thought she's gonna kill me.
5788620	5790620	I didn't see her.
5790620	5792620	I didn't see her killer though.
5792620	5794620	Listen, if it's not Amy, it's Rhea.
5794620	5796620	Trust me.
5796620	5798620	No, it's not Rhea.
5798620	5800620	I saw her do a body scan.
5800620	5802620	But she's the one that she might not have killed that round.
5802620	5804620	Sorry, Amy.
5804620	5806620	It wasn't Rain.
5806620	5808620	It wasn't Rain.
5808620	5810620	She accused me.
5810620	5812620	Stop killing me.
5812620	5814620	Oh, no.
5814620	5816620	Oh, my God.
5816620	5818620	Wait a second.
5818620	5820620	It's not me.
5820620	5822620	Are you sure?
5822620	5824620	Are you sure?
5824620	5826620	Listen, I can't believe it's not me.
5826620	5828620	I can't believe it's not me.
5828620	5830620	Rhea, we're the only ones we can trust.
5830620	5832620	We have to figure out
5832620	5834620	if it's Azura or Rain.
5834620	5836620	I think it's Rhea.
5836620	5838620	It's not Rhea.
5838620	5840620	What does Rain not understand about medbay scan?
5840620	5842620	What does she not understand?
5842620	5844620	It's not me.
5844620	5846620	It's not me.
5846620	5848620	It's not me.
5848620	5850620	No, but that was just the first time.
5850620	5852620	Old people should not be a lot of play among us.
5852620	5854620	Rhea, we need to
5854620	5856620	in the shoot room.
5856620	5858620	We have to be good on this.
5858620	5860620	We need to think about our steps.
5860620	5862620	Okay.
5862620	5864620	What if it's Sheebie?
5864620	5866620	Because Rhea said that Sheebie never scanned.
5866620	5868620	So I didn't have a scan.
5868620	5870620	Sheebie could be...
5870620	5872620	How are we going to know that?
5872620	5874620	Sheebie could be
5874620	5876620	marinating Rhea.
5876620	5878620	Yes, it's a smelly smell.
5878620	5880620	Okay, okay.
5880620	5882620	Rhea, I've been nothing but defend you.
5882620	5884620	I'm the most.
5884620	5886620	Each one of you.
5886620	5888620	It was with Rain.
5888620	5890620	You were at admin.
5890620	5892620	Sheebie had like five opportunities to kill me
5892620	5894620	and she never did.
5894620	5896620	Unless she's trying to gaslight.
5896620	5898620	Yes, because if we got rid of one
5898620	5900620	and my B is gaslighting you
5900620	5902620	because if Mercy was the imposter
5902620	5904620	and it's only one
5904620	5906620	imposter left.
5906620	5908620	You think me and Mercy are going to be imposter together
5908620	5910620	three times in a row?
5910620	5912620	Yeah.
5912620	5914620	Shroney was literally imposter like four times in a row.
5914620	5916620	I wouldn't believe it.
5916620	5918620	Rhea, you have to...
5918620	5920620	I have to vote as Rhea.
5920620	5922620	No, it's not me.
5922620	5924620	Who do you want to vote for?
5924620	5926620	I will vote for whoever you want to vote for.
5926620	5928620	It's over.
5928620	5930620	Alright, love, just vote me off and win.
5930620	5932620	Is that what you want? I'm not the imposter.
5932620	5934620	Okay, I'm going to vote for Rhea because
5934620	5936620	Rain always points to you even when she's not.
5936620	5938620	Oh, thank god.
5938620	5940620	Yippee!
5940620	5942620	Yeah?
5942620	5944620	I'm sorry, is there if it wasn't you, I apologize.
5944620	5946620	Yippee!
5946620	5948620	Yes!
5948620	5950620	Yes, yes!
5950620	5952620	Easy, easy.
5952620	5954620	You did it. I told you.
5954620	5956620	I'm sorry, is there a...
5956620	5958620	I should have let you win, damn.
5958620	5960620	Bouched for you.
5960620	5962620	Yeah, I had your back.
5962620	5964620	Don't forget that.
5964620	5966620	Man, is there a... I'm so sorry.
5966620	5968620	Where's my story, Rain?
5968620	5970620	You keep accusing me of doing anything.
5970620	5972620	Okay.
5972620	5974620	Listen, once you're out of the game,
5974620	5976620	I can...
5976620	5978620	I'm sorry.
5978620	5980620	I'm back. I'll just stop playing the game.
5980620	5982620	I was getting nervous because I didn't know how to defend myself.
5982620	5984620	I was running around the map, which is crazy.
5984620	5986620	I'm just teasing, I'm sorry.
5986620	5988620	I'm sorry.
5988620	5990620	I'm not sorry.

6008620	6010620	Well, at least Azura got to be imposter.
6010620	6012620	Yeah, one time.
6012620	6014620	Well, maybe you're imposter again.

6044620	6046620	Oh, okay.
6046620	6048620	Is her internet down?
6048620	6050620	She didn't die. We didn't know what happened with her internet.
6050620	6052620	Oh, she just got disconnected.
6052620	6054620	Oh, yeah.
6054620	6056620	Rain.

6058620	6060620	It's not me. It's not, guys.
6060620	6062620	I know, but it's getting her back in.
6062620	6064620	Oh, okay.
6064620	6066620	Alright, it's...
6066620	6068620	Imposters come forward.

6072620	6074620	Wait, who is it? Rain or Reo?
6074620	6076620	It was Imi?
6076620	6078620	Yeah, Imi and Azura.
6078620	6080620	Imi and Azura?
6080620	6082620	Oh, I fucking knew Azura got it twice in a row.
6082620	6084620	Oh, you called it.
6084620	6086620	I feel bad for her.
6086620	6088620	The way that she said how she denied it, how she was like,
6088620	6090620	yeah, imagine.
6090620	6092620	I was like...
6092620	6094620	We heard that flick during your voice.
6094620	6096620	Yup, yup, yup.
6096620	6098620	Wait for me.
6098620	6100620	Ready to stand on the side of the table?
6100620	6102620	Alright, I'll press the button.
6102620	6104620	I like pressing buttons.
6104620	6106620	Press the button, girl.
6106620	6108620	Two more, and then we will...
6108620	6110620	We will call it.
6110620	6112620	Yay!
6112620	6114620	It's not really much of a conclusion other than us all accusing each other
6114620	6116620	and never talking again.
6116620	6118620	I know, it's so cute.
6118620	6120620	Wait, is Azura calling me?
6122620	6124620	Azura, what do you have to say for yourself?
6124620	6126620	Is that your mic?
6126620	6128620	Is that someone's mic or something?
6128620	6130620	That sounds like popcorn.
6130620	6132620	I was muted for a second.
6132620	6134620	Yeah, it sounds like popcorn.
6136620	6138620	Is that me?
6138620	6140620	Wait, you guys hear that? No, I hear that.
6140620	6142620	You guys hear that?
6142620	6144620	Something's crunchy.
6144620	6146620	Who's kissing?
6146620	6148620	Who's frying some chicken?
6148620	6150620	Is it me?

6176620	6178620	I'm going to mute right now, hold on.
6180620	6182620	No, you can still hear it.
6182620	6184620	Okay, it's not me then.
6184620	6186620	Someone's talking to me, alright.
6186620	6188620	Someone in the middle, come to the edge if it's not...
6188620	6190620	If you don't...
6190620	6192620	I'm going to mute, hang on.
6192620	6194620	Wait, if you hear it all...
6194620	6196620	It's gone, it's gone.
6196620	6198620	I didn't mute.
6198620	6200620	We're getting a guy...
6200620	6202620	Who's got a Geiger counter for radiation?

6422620	6424620	Everyone's actually ganging up on me.
6424620	6426620	Because they can't even believe for a second
6426620	6428620	that I might be a wee bit nice in this game.
6428620	6430620	Like, so they just instantly get...

6740440	6742440	It's between Amy and Momosa.
6742440	6745440	Yeah, because me and Strani were hanging out in Med Bay.
6745440	6748440	I believe Rea's claim on the fifth card swipe.
6748440	6750440	Momosa, what are you...
6750440	6751440	Yeah, Rea is...
6751440	6753440	Momosa, say your piece.
6753440	6754440	No.
6754440	6755440	Goodbye.
6755440	6758440	See you later, ma'ams.
6758440	6759440	I don't...
6759440	6760440	I know who it is.
6760440	6762440	You will rue this day.
6762440	6763440	I don't...
6763440	6765440	Oh, I don't know who to vote for.
6765440	6766440	I'm with Strani.
6766440	6767440	Okay, yeah.
6767440	6768440	I was with Strani in Med Bay.
6768440	6772440	It's Momosa then, because literally Shibi and Shibi have been touching each other all game.
6772440	6773440	Goodbye.
6773440	6775440	Yeah, we were touching Rea in Med Bay.
6776440	6779440	She was doing a full body scan of my delicious bod.
6779440	6781440	Not Momosa.
6781440	6782440	What?
6782440	6783440	Momosa!
6783440	6785440	Why would you ban them like me then?
6785440	6786440	Momosa!
6786440	6787440	Momosa!
6787440	6788440	Momosa!
6788440	6789440	Wait, when I was...
6789440	6790440	Momosa!
6790440	6793440	Wait, when I was with Momosa, she could have killed me at any time.
6793440	6795440	And it could have been like...
6795440	6797440	Well, now we can't hit them.
6797440	6798440	Well, now we can't hit them.
6798440	6802440	Rea, because she just stood still and activated the fucking thing.
6802440	6804440	Aw.
6804440	6805440	Yes!
6806440	6808440	You scared me!
6811440	6812440	Okay.
6813440	6814440	Wait, what?
6815440	6816440	I'm so confused.
6816440	6820440	Wait, can you activate sabotage's whilst on the move?
6822440	6825440	Can you activate sabotage's while moving?
6825440	6827440	I don't know.
6829440	6831440	I honestly don't know.
6831440	6834440	If you can activate sabotage's while moving.
6835440	6836440	I feel like...
6836440	6838440	Can you activate sabotage's while moving?
6838440	6841440	That sabotage came on while Rea wasn't moving.
6841440	6842440	Aw, are you serious?
6842440	6843440	What the fuck?
6843440	6844440	Wait, wait.
6844440	6845440	No!
6845440	6846440	I was only about to hit the button!
6846440	6847440	Is it aim?
6847440	6849440	Wait, what?
6851440	6855440	I'm gonna hide and trigger the button if you want to do the lights.
6857440	6858440	Please do the lights.
6858440	6860440	They killed a mother with a baby.
6862440	6863440	Did somebody leave?
6863440	6865440	I actually pulled a clutch that's actually crazy.
6865440	6867440	I'm so proud of her, oh my god.
6867440	6869440	Wait, what happened?
6869440	6870440	Wait, what happened to everyone?
6870440	6872440	You guys don't clear the sabotage.
6872440	6874440	No one ever clears the sabotage.
6876440	6878440	Oh, it's the lights!
6879440	6881440	It's the lights, so if you don't fix it...
6881440	6883440	Dude, no, not the lights.

6965040	6969600	how to say like one more for luck uh in the behind the scenes are like lord of the rings in the
6970560	6975680	whenever he like does the scene like it obviously is the director and the actors
6975680	6983200	you need multiple renditions of the scene to be recorded out um and one and he always goes one
6983200	6989440	more for luck one more for luck which is him asking the actor to give one more scene even though
6989440	6997920	oh my god oh my god mercy killed mercy killed rain i saw mercy killed rain mercy killed rain

7415280	7420720	bro that was awful i feel so bad for doing that but hopefully it was fun and not like
7420720	7428000	oh my god i hate this um yeah other than the audio issues someone said that a zura for some
7428000	7436080	reason couldn't hear me even though i'm loud in scots like um me got a awful thought honestly i
7436080	7445600	me any time it's not any i i me like that uh got hit with a scots rage i don't think you guys
7445600	7453680	know i was capable of that but i warned you i warned you and and everyone climbing for one more game
7453680	7458880	means you can be confident that they had a lot of fun good i'm glad that was so fun and it was like
7458880	7463920	i actually felt a bit nervous like starting up but i feel so comfortable with the yumi plus girls
7463920	7468640	like they just i don't know all of us seem to be on the same page like we were all in a group
7468640	7474400	called one hour before figuring it out and like i started doing like a veal or meeting like kind
7474400	7478320	of recapping on some stuff and i'm like oh you guys couldn't listen in as well like it's just a
7478320	7484400	few notes so i was like oh everyone's reached 5000 subscribers so we've got an artwork to celebrate
7484800	7494080	post and all that um it was hilarious yeah i'm ready for uh the after game stress relief honestly
7494080	7501120	scrawny rage was that rage in that badly i kind of remember i think my rage is basically me going
7501120	7507680	uh so the other person stops talking so i can say my piece i think that's what my rage is hopefully
7507680	7515280	it's not too bad uh might have been taking the piss a little bit the whole stream was great yeah
7515280	7522080	you like that i'm so glad the only you only rage on someone accuses you and you're innocent
7522080	7527760	oh it annoys me like it was funny don't get me wrong it was so funny but as soon as they go it's
7527760	7533840	scrawny and i'm like i literally have not done a single thing like i haven't spoken i haven't
7533840	7540000	claimed anything oh it's scrawny i'm like okay just because the scottish person is like get at the
7540000	7548400	game like come on i do i have to admit my favorite thing was the double kills um when like there was
7548400	7554560	four of us but two of them posture going three two one oh it was so satisfying and one oh one
7554560	7559520	and one of the kills rea was so slow to respond she probably could have reported the body in time
7560080	7568880	um but she was so slow that she got yoinked um oh honestly on the mention of five came
7571920	7575680	Paul of scrawny is getting forceful because you aren't eating your tomato
7577040	7584720	uh scrawny you're too good at the game it's actually i'm aware there's another map um i'm not
7584800	7592880	really familiar with it at all um and i have spelt modus terribly wrong in the second description
7593840	7601920	of that um the serotonin from the double kills oh my god it was so sat satisfying especially
7601920	7608880	with the close proximity just like oh hi and then like i just go three two one and they're both gone
7608880	7614880	oh and we just like split in different ways oh and that one game i can't me and mary say
7615600	7621200	didn't even get the round to voting because we had killed so perfectly at different sides of the map
7621760	7627600	oh he's so good literally can you handle it oh it's so can you handle it
7628320	7631840	this is so unbelievably good i'm gonna see if there's someone we can read i write it
