literally I spent
how many extra bucks to get a moat should I use like one which is the head motion
toggle. Right I'm gonna move the chair out the way because I don't think I need it
again. But if I need it she's right there. I'll get a chair I'll just keep
her to see. Lick up Moomi's straight. Sweat Gintu's strong raw. Peer body best
body. I'm hydrated by looking your sweat. No my sweat would be salty that's right
that's where I lose my soul. I'm gonna need refling, I'm gonna need something
that helps me replenish my salt levels. Huh huh huh come on it's too easy to make these
it's too easy it's too easy sorry it's too obvious. Right what are we doing? Stop
getting me distracted with your foolish ambition. Where do you play Elden Ring
actually? Whoa! Rotate the joycon to the left and grip it into your abs. Oh god.
Press it into your abs to hold. It's a joke. Press it and hold against your tummy.
Okay this hurts. Well pressing in your stomach lean. Okay.
I guess the other way. Oh no I can't do abs and I can't do arms. No I'm gonna be
sick. Hold on I need a burp. Oh that wasn't a good one. That wasn't a good burp
refling. It has been a worse result. And he walked up to the hill and he
marched him down again. What? I don't think I get it. Actually. Ready? Not really.
Go! Oh the grand old jerk of york. He had ten thousand men. He marched them up to the
top of the hill and he marched them down again. Oh when they were up they were up.
And when they were down they were down. And when they were only half way around they were either up or down.
That is a British chant for you. There you go.
Okay I got the 300. This is the worst one ever. Oh no. Can we go a bit more to the right?
Hey hey hey. Hit him with a hey hey. Okay hold on. I'm on a tamer. Why did I hear
tamer noises? I'm getting nervous. I'm sweating. Why did I hear tamer noises? I don't see a tamer.
So I'm actually jogging on the spot right now. I am not losing to tame. I'm not
losing to tame. I refuse. Okay this is it. Hey that was a really unique one.
Shawnee didn't you get the lyrics right? Like how dare you? How much does everyone
reveal their way? We used to be the biggest. Emmie, Tiny, Aisy, Tiny, Mercy, Nex,
Shawnee, Nex. She beat Nex. Azura can be as big as a skyscraper because she's a
goddess. So good luck measuring her. Oh my god. I had to do that off the top of my
head. No. Oh I didn't. Why would you not let me. Oh whatever finish. Whatever. If you
screw up the coins to spawn. I didn't even grab them. The tamer is just for our coin
points. Oh well. You know what we should play Wii Fit. That Wii Fit game. Like on that
board. And you stand on the board and the things that you fat bastard. And you guys can
know my real weight. Like whenever someone's like oh how much do you weigh? Whenever I tell
them they're like I don't believe it. You don't look as heavy as that. And I'm like yeah
it's all in the dumpy. Thank you. I'll be here all week. You have your strength at high
by the way. I do? The best way I can describe your body would be when Shawnee and Ruben
Esk curvy all over. I don't even know what that means. What does Ruben Esk mean? You're
using English and I don't know. Right core crusher. Right we'll play all the minigames
and then I think we'll do a running one. Wait why did that not work? Oh the things sideways.
That's why it didn't work. The things sideways after that game. I don't know why they did
it that way but sure sure. Right we'll do all the minigames. And then we'll let's get
to it. It's in the dump truck. I'm gonna need proof of that. You'll get proof in October
all you need. Everything you need baby. Wait what? Rotate it to the left again. No I hate
these ones. I'm gonna squeeze out a fart at this rate. I'm just pushing against my stomach
and my stomach goes at any fart. While pressing into your stomach twist to the right. Oh my
headset's getting away. Now release the tension while pressing in on your stomach. What is
this? What is this? Smash all the robots. Be careful of the robots with your shield. With
your shield. What? What is this? Go. Relax and then press and hit. And relax, press, hit,
relax, press, hit, press, hit, relax, hit, relax, hit, relax, hit, relax, hit. Sorry I'm having
to say it. I'm having to say it. I'm just saying it out loud. I'm just fucking aware.
Oh I'm relaxed, relaxed. It's like Kegel exercises but worse. Relax, relax. I'm like freaking
Breville in.
Your shield is rubbish.
Relax, relax. Reflex, relax. Just let it happen, relax. Oh my god.
Oh that was a hard one. Quit feying me, reflet. My god. Oh I need to sit down after that one.
Oh I'm sitting there on my chair.
Oh my god that was so hard. I had to like freaking remember. Are you squiddin' me right now?
Thank you.
Why? Anon would like to ask. Wait what was my heart rate? 186? Okay. Heart rate record.
186. Let's go.
Okay. Anon would like to ask. Hi Stroni. I was wondering when it comes to running.
Are you a sprinter or do you run for endurance? And I don't either. Like do you care about how
fast you are or how far you're going? I'd like to compare workers. You know you see I am a dwarf
from Lord of the Rings. I'm great short distances and by short distances I mean less than 100 meters.
I am a cyclist and I am a walker. I am not a sprinter. So when we get to the sprinting stage
we're gonna do a level that requires sprinting. You are going to hear how much I do not sprint.
Okay.
Okay. Our heart rate record is 186. So we think we can beat it. I don't know.
Need to go cycle. Like I can cycle fine. Cycle and I have no issues with. Right. Uh sure record it.
Why not? To Stroni. Not to be confused with uh I don't know something else that you could confuse
with. Um right gulting wait get lit-utting gallery. Lean left and right to avoid the
bomba. So we've got three more minigames and then we're going to do jogging. Are you ready for the
jogging? Ha ha ha. Gonna do jogging there. Right get lit-utting gallery. Wait as in gluttonous as
in you fat bastard. Did the game just call me obese? What the fuck? 186 feet per minute. That's
right you can see it live here folks. You know what you've never seen a hyperactive heart before?
Well now you have. Now you have. That was me slapping my thighs by the way.
I'm not uh I'm not doing Mario Kart tomorrow. We're playing Suica or Suqya. What do we do?
What have you stumbled into? Just the most suspicious noises a woman can make that isn't
suspicious at all. You've got quick circulation. What can I say these? Oh no it's an arm one. Oh no.
Okay that's fine I can do that. Oh I'm gonna burp again but not the good kind.
Oh that's a vomit kind of burp. Would you still love me if I vomited up all my water from this morning?
No you're glutes meaning your ass. Collect all the tokens. I'll try my best. Ready?
You pronounce it gluting as in your glutes. Oh glutes! Glutes maximum. Oh I get it now. Okay that
makes sense. I thought I was calling me gluttonous and I was like excuse you. Why do you think I'm on
the video game in the first place? Gluttonous based on... Clean to the side as you breathe out.
Clean to the side as you breathe out. I'm leaning, I'm leaning, I'm leaning, I'm leaning, I'm leaning.
I like this one. This is so easy. I'm just standing on the spot.
I said it too quick. I shouldn't have said anything. The bombs were too much.
Thank you time to say me for telling me the right title. You didn't have to pay me to do that though.
You could have just typed it in chat. You guys when you're flipping to put on a bug my hips are
like cross the bullet for it in real life as well. Like I don't need to lean with my hips but I'm just
just to prove how curvy I am. Oh look at the week 2 E birds as well. Oh they're so beautiful.
Can I get so big? Oh my first perfect. Let's go. Leave it to me. Record. Yeah I'm going to rub it in
the girl's face as I got perfect. Me telling them hey when you guys play this game you need to do
the minigames for no particular reason just so I can like rank them all. Do you use bike for
exercise or leisure for transport? So I get healthy from it. Anon. Anon in this says,
Strony. Paint you an audio idea. Strony pulls the thigh muscle after pushing herself too hard from
her workout and asks for response to help stretch out her muscles to relieve the pain with the
massage. I think you can see where the rest of it's going. Hey hey hey. Hey hey hey. That's
literally a Zura's most recent audio thing. We think of like Anon because I literally wrote that
for a Zura. Roughly. And I say has one coming out as well actually. It's my brat's irresistible thighs.
You're welcome OGsans. I know exactly what you all want to hear for the most part. Yes my
scripts are shit but in general I know what you want to hear. Right what's my heart rate? Okay I'll
wait until it goes down to 140. Okay let's sit down for a moment. Why did it go up? Why is it whenever
I say what's my heart rate? My heart gets nervous and like jumps up. I'm sitting down to give myself
a second. I saw the stream get some sleep and well. Res well thanks for hanging. At least you
aren't taping glorp your giggle stick bro. Hey y'all. Has mummy pushed herself hard? She's been behaving.
186 beats per minute. So for every second my heart beated twice and then some. Roughly. Then some.
We are reaching 175. Break core. That's so good.
Strony sweat rack. Thank you for the tip. Hi Strony make sure to work up a good sweat and then you
can use me. Clean it up once you're done. Well I was gonna see if I can give myself a round of
applause at the end of stream. Uh if you know you know. You know I just thought we could. Your
scripts are now. Your scripts are now giggle sticks by like them. I mean AC was like AC got
back to me and she was like I really liked how simplistic the way your scripts were written
in comparison to the script master and I was like right I'll send them a message. I'll tell them
you know to copy the way I do it. Um for the most part. Uh mummy ain't gonna have the energy to jump.
Okay we're 130. Okay I went up because I noticed it but it's just because my heart rate is so shy
okay. She doesn't deserve such things. Right whoever said exercise doesn't take up time.
I'm already exhausted and we're not even hit the 50 minute mark. I said what I said I'm exhausted.
I we're gonna get any more armpit audios. Um from Emmy in the video game maybe.
What was that? That was just a silly. With your elbows swing too slow. Okay hold on hold on let me
take my headset off. The body headsets wires in the way. I'm getting obliterated right too slow.
What? With your elbows at the side swing it.
What is going on? Bro give us a. The guy is stalling out. Is that all in? All right I'm just
gonna do that thing. I'm actually looking for. With your elbows at your side swing. I can't swing
that fast. I'm not even. Who played this game more? This is shit.
I'm getting absolutely rolled in a freaking exercise video game.
That was awful. Go do that again. Smack all the discs.
That was awful. I'm thinking I'm gonna get sunwalked in a freaking exercise video game.
I'm just fucking doing this. I'm fucking swinging.
I'm swinging. With your elbows at your side twist your upper body.
Oh yeah you like that. Okay I'll fuck it. Wait they take points for me missing even though
the game makes sense. I'm freaking swinging yeah. You can literally see by my model I am swinging
on the spot right. My ass meat is jiggling.
Oh forgiveness sake. Bro I'm actually getting sunwalked.
I'm getting sunwalked in a freaking exercise video game. Oh come on me. Come on give me a shot.
Oh come on. Fuck off that was the worst game we have played by far.
And I got a bravo for that. I'm right. That was awful. My ass meat is what jiggling.
I was going left and right and I could feel it. I'm moving and I was like excuse me.
Strongly barefoot. I wouldn't game with freaking shoes on. Are you serious?
I had a game with shoes on. We should not get in the spring a lot. Right last mini game.
And then we're going to do running and I will show you how pathetic my running is.
The treadmill. Oh this is the running game mode. Control your running speed to move
left or right on the treadmill and gather tokens. What?
Oh it's good though. It's good. Next time jiggle him up.
Yeah I ain't killed down before this next runner one because if it's about like
but running my heart rate is going to
explode. At over 180 my heart was beaten three times per second. Oh yeah you're right 180 divided
by three is 60. Yeah. Yeah. Oh that's so cool. My heart was beaten three times per second.
Boom boom boom. So literally boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom. That's what my heart
was doing. Are you squiddin me right now? I'm so smart.
I don't know. I don't say it's so strong. He likes guys with a little bit of chop in their stomach.
I like fat boys. Give me fat men. Hey Tony. I want to feed you. I want to rub your belly
after a hand feed you. Get like sit on your lap. Spoon feed you. Maybe like take away or something.
Then I rub your belly afterwards. And then I R word you.
Architect oh she. And don't worry if you're a beanpole apparently that's the terminology
which I found absolutely hilarious when you guys taught me. If you're a beanpole don't worry I'll
fatten you up. We'll hold you to that promise.
Actually apparently skinny guys are called beanpoles. I'm gonna find out the funniest thing I've ever
read in my life. Wait does Stroney live in a gingerbread home? No I'm not a witch. Are you
serious? The witch that makes those wainzy candy sweets and that? No I'm not a witch.
Stroney's laughing at me. I'm not laughing at you. Are you a beanpole? If you're a beanpole don't
worry. Just order take away. It's fine. I'll make you some of my treats.
What if you're kind of average? Then it's easy to put weight on you. Smile. Do you not know how
architecture works? I'm Hansel Maxing. Oh that's so good.
Okay right enough stalling. Do the next exercise. You lazy lazy switch.
Or say full of poet. I'm not a squid. I'm a skunkish. You're facts right.
Right I'm standing up again. Let's see how much my heart rate goes up because I stood up.
Oh we're in the 30s.
I know it's my time and I'll be. It's so far over for me. I need at least 10 years in film
dad bod ready. I can make it happen. I don't know. Give me like eight months. I think I'll get what I want.
Okay are you squidding me right now? Just slow point the ring there. If we run ahead and
lead you with a leash would you run faster mama? Would you run faster? Wait what if we run it?
Sorry my headset is currently hitting the microphone. You stop that young man.
What do you say Kaidon? If we run ahead and lead you with a leash would you run
faster? If you run ahead. No I don't like running. I don't enjoy running. Don't make me run.
Walkies fine. Absolutely fine on walkies. Running? No. I won't burp again. The water's coming back.
But not the good kid. I think I actually am going to be sick if I'm not careful.
Oh I just threw up in my throat.
Oh dear. What did I do?
And that was pure stomach acid in my throat.
All right I'll tell, I'll make you a deal. We'll finish this one and then we'll have a bit of a
break. Oh I just threw up. What did I do? My whole point is a true mistake exercise and I can't.
All right give me one more, give me one more chance okay? Clean it out. Ready? What am I going to do?
Okay I can do this. I can do this. Just one more, one more.
Wait how did I go backwards? I just stopped running.
Oh my gosh. Are you squidding me right now?
No she's just going to be like an English bulldog. Lying down and not moving.
Wait I'll check it out. That's a return assist. Wait how did I make it so I'm only in one leg?
Oh my god. Wait what? Jump. Okay okay and then stop running? Oh this is confusing. It's not late.
What the fuck? Right I need to do like an actual dog in one. This is terrible. I can't, I can't leap.
What the? What am I trying to achieve right now? Jump. Okay and then no stop.
And then go forward again. What the? This is the worst game mode. Okay this is the second
worst game mode after the other one. I can't maintain a lane. It keeps putting me a header behind.
It won't let me maintain a lane. It doesn't matter what it does. You need to control your speed?
How? It wants to constantly put me ahead. I'm trying.
Oh my god. They're only having to attack.
Hold on, hold on, hold on. No we need to do like the walking ones.
And now jump. No forward.
I literally have to start and stop to try and aim for a lane because I can't maintain a speed. It keeps
like putting me ahead. Why is this so delayed as well? No and then it just stops me right before the
coins. Oh come on mate. Brav. Brav. Take a break. Keep a steady pace. Yeah good luck.
Without it I can't do anything. Oh I just dropped my open car controller. You mean that big expensive
piece of equipment? Yeah I just dropped that. What are you going to do then? All right finish, finish.
All right we've done the minigames. What are the other stuff that you can do? There's, there's butt
stuff. And then there's running. We'll run for, I'll take a break and then we'll run and we'll do the
butt set and then we'll do running and then I'll see how I feel because I legit did it. Okay there
we go. I don't sound like I'm halfway across the room now. Hi Refling. Thank you Momo Loh. No she
is just going to be like an English Bulldog lying down and not moving. Yeah apparently those dogs
are like resistant to going on walks or something. I don't know. I thought dogs enjoyed walks all the
time. You would get excited for the butt stuff. I don't know what you're talking about Refling.
You've done great yeah. I've not bet my record of 186 though. Shock and behavior. Shock and behavior.
Shawnee if you get so close after sweating what did he say? Abs incoming better not. I don't want
abs. I want curves. I want hips. I want soft. Please do not beat the record. I mean we might
be in the drawing section. Shawnee's trainer. Shawnee's trainer says you're such a good girl for
doing your exercise. Keep it up and you can get a special treat. No you're not turning into one of
those two. Nope. You guys had your way with me on the headset whilst I was in the convenience store.
I was trying to service all these customers. No serve the customers not service the customers.
Those are two different sentences in the English language. If English is not your first language
to service serve customers and to service customers are two different things. Please
be careful if English isn't your first language and you use those kind of. I'm so sorry.
I was not afraid in slip because I was servicing you guys in the break room.
Damn I'm a customer. Service maximum.
You're so goofy. The customers are reeflings all along and you service them? I mean I'm sorry
that was a fun stream. I really enjoyed it. I know it's such a boring game. I probably won't
play it on stream again but it was so fun. I cannot stay long since I'm at work but I hope
you're having fun and getting lots of water. I'm having so much fun. Thank you so much.
Thank you for the super chat as well. I cannot stay long. Yes have fun at work hydrate eat.
Are you from Ireland? Because Irish you were Maine.
Sorry to burst your bubble meat but I'm Scottish so yeah. Joke didn't land but nice try though.
Nice attempt but I am from Scotland. I'm from the other country that kind of sounds like that.
Yeah but it was a good one. I'll give you that. I was good. I mean I got a giggle but yeah I'm from
Scotland the other country. Bro ain't leaving scott free. Oh oh good one. I'm killing myself. No
no no no it's fine. I'm across the port. I'm literally across the river. It's not a river
it's a sea but I'm across the sea from Ireland it's fine. Honestly I enjoyed the supermarket stream.
I wouldn't mind doing it again. Ink on this reefing right now.
I Scottish you were Maine. That's not even a sentence. What's going on here?
Scottish or Irish? First one to move is gay. Do you really love us? Do you not stick around for
the big watery kiss that I do at the end? Who goes there? Gremble and Anon. Are you squid and
mary though? If Stroney is an architect then call me the job site because I want to be worked on.
No way that is so good. Thank you for giving me your super cherry. Your super chat cherry not your
super cherry Jesus. Oh my god. Gremble thank you and Anonymous what did you say? Hearing you say
you like guys who got dadboards make me feel a lot better and gives us so much more self confidence.
I don't know I just always liked it. I don't know if it's because I like it. Are you squid and mary or whatever.
I just gravitate towards it. Yeah. I accidentally called you cunny struggles to a friend and now I
have to correct myself every time I say your name. The gap mo. Rika the gap mo if I had a
lollipop model and I sounded like this. I can't even imagine lightening my Scottish
voice. How did I even do that? Good morning everyone. Good morning everyone. Who's it going?
I'm Stroney Cattles the cunny of Vealour. The European. Oh no wait I see it's European.
Oh Vealour. I hope you're ready for another fantastic stream together. That's what you want.
No I can't lighten Max then. It doesn't work. It would be so good. The gap mo would be
perfect aggressive lollipop. No lightening just use the normal voice. Who's it going lads?
And I'm like in a tiny itty bitty body like Emmie. Well I tell you when Emmie was the first
model to be produced so I had to pilot her to make sure she was okay and hearing my voice come
out of this itty bitty adorable little thing and I'm just like how's it going right this is a test
I'm looking left I'm looking right here's an emotion test here's her crying here's her doing this
it was quite it was rather entertaining thank you Rika. I prefer mummy Stroney than lollipop Stroney.
Last cunny honestly that would be pretty good instead of do not pass go do not collect 200 bucks
the cunny stops yeah it sounds cunny enough welcome back lollipop get your drawers situated
I'm coming at you oh I've never heard that a sentence that should that should have been my motto
April first Vealour should just switch models do you know how expensive a prank like that would
be are you joking? Truly a dwarf experience. Stroney has piloted Emmie. I piloted everyone
did I not tell you the secret you know like the shorts that are on everyone's channels like the
early ones not the later ones not like the content ones obviously uh I'm I'm piloting their mix
the girls gave me voice lines and I created the memes for them so like I say doing the isotope
meme where she like blows up the fucking demon core that's me I made that I used her voice
it's me all it's all me but now the girls are starting to do their own stuff like as I said
like Mersey's most recent shorts I mean these are her on stream like you can't I can't you
pilot a mech when it's her on stream you know what I'm saying she was in every girl's body this is
the truest reason behind her HR absence the best mega pilot of all time the classic April
first joke is to switch models within me and stream on their channel I feel like that would hurt
their channel growth if someone's expecting like cute adorable AC and I pop up and I'm like hi dadas
and my fucking boys oh how's it going oh gee sands oh my voice is just a bit tickly I've got
we tickle in my throat the day are you joking me the oh gee sands would be writing they'd be like
get off the screen get off the stage get out of her account right now I was inside all the girls I
absolutely was there's nothing you can do about it uh reluctantly saying well we know you're all
six of them but we have to keep up the keep up honestly what are you talking about dadas
oh my dear bleeding my heart I can't wait to play this game with you
oh that would be hilarious Scottish face the last of the days I mean get on the maker or
strongly we'll have to go again maybe in the middle of the club so it's not too unexpected
explains why she has a muppet model do I look like a muppet to you
nah that's what they all do switch and impersonate if someone gets filtered by a joke skillet I
can't wait to play I can't wait to play 24 hours of league I mean honestly the problem is I think
she'd be would have to be me she's the only one that can come close to mimicking a Scottish accent
so I think it's already confirmed that she was going to be on my channel if we end up doing
a prank is always like that you talking like a zura is so good is it thigh grip oh what's the wrong
little rave ring are you getting your wires crossed I can't I can't guess right right let's do some
workouts for our gluteus maximus I've had enough of a break I know ironically kind of hope this
I think I would stop functioning if you left even for a prank I mean if one of the girls did go on
my channel I would just stream after they had finished having a go on me and then we can all
have a go on me at the same time you can't see it right now but I'm thrusting in real life I'm
literally spanking your arson your life I'm thrusting I just thought you should know I just thought
you should know the stream is going to be a limited ads will be worth it though
you come sweating over limit that sweat over channel termination that's different that's a
whole other ballpark you can play rhythm game you've not told me what to do right we're doing
squat okay white squat
okay let's move
two three five four all right five six seven eight
Wait, why does it not get full points?
You're amazing.
Oh, no, no, no, no, raise the arms.
This is how I'm going to throw up.
Oh!
Oh, I'm going.
You ain't got nothing on me.
Right, left, right, left, right.
I'm energetic. Are you joking me?
My knees are literally about to hit my nose in the game.
Oh, I'm supposed to bring down the broken arm.
I forgot to bring down the arm.
I just hold the arm up and point in front of you.
Oops, I didn't bring my arms down.
I'm so sorry.
I already got 100 points for that.
What?
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two,
1,2, 1,2, 1,2, 1,2, 1,2, 1,2, 1,2, 1,2, 1,2, 1,2, 1,2, 1,2, 1,2, I like this one.
I'm doing WHAAAT?
If you wouldn't need a screen, watch the example carefully.
What the hell?
What the heck?
Okay, I'm on the floor so I'm gonna try to make it open.
What?
What even is this?
Are you squeaking?
I'm on the floor.
Bend your knees, hold the ring, squeeze your knees together.
Okay, let's go.
Try this, work your butt out.
Oh!
Amazing.
Oh, take it.
Nice.
Take it.
Bend it.
Oh.
Great.
Five more.
I get this.
You're almost there.
Perfect.
Hold on for me.
Very nice.
Take it.
Good.
Ah!
Fine work.
You're fine.
Nice.
Well done.
Well done.
Wonderful.
What?
Well.
You made it.
Oh my god, you took it so well.
It was fun.
That was insane.
You won't need a screen, just watch the example.
How is it gonna know?
Set the ring calm down.
Place both hands on the floor.
Extend your legs behind you.
Okay, I've done that.
Ah!
Are you squidding me right now?
Are you going to fart?
Are you serious?
At some point, we are going to hear
the Lego dismantling sound effect.
That was super energetically.
Oh, we're doing better.
Oh!
Oh!
I've been doing better.
Right, right, right.
Don't forget to breathe.
I can do it.
I can do it.
I can do it.
Do it.
This is what we're training for.
We're doing fine.
Get in that ear.
It's the wide breath.
Right now!
Ah!
Left.
Right.
Right.
You made it.
Ah!
Time for a break.
No!
I want more.
Give me more of the reflame.
Okay.
I think I can do better than that.
Sorry, but I do.
Oh, I did it.
I think I can do it.
I want an A.
Sorry.
I want an A.
I messed up on one of the exercises.
Let me breathe for a second, though.
I should see the little,
just see catch my breath and we'll go again.
Okay?
It's fine.
Fine.
I'm back.
If only there was a 3D model.
Oh, boy.
I have good news for you.
If you keep supporting the girls on Patreon.
Okay.
Let me just lower the old heart rate.
I'm guessing I didn't beat my record though.
Thank you Anonymous for the tip again.
You did not get a perfect,
the sound quality of the thighs.
Could you hear me thumping?
I don't know which one of us will need a break after this.
Mommy is a huge, you know, word.
We were like, didn't we say?
And he goes, dear Lord,
she's gone, run fellow replings.
I'll hold her back.
I wouldn't everyone be fighting to hold me back.
I have some water.
Thank you.
Oh my God, my little voice is cracking.
I was so fun.
I like that one.
We're doing that one again.
I want an A.
Oh, I said what I said.
I want an A.
The wreathlings will hold Johnny back
so that the snowberries can escape.
The snowberries will try to escape into A.C.'s room.
What are you talking about?
Try to run that train.
Everyone would be volunteering to hold you back.
It'd be like the Monty Python scene.
I can take some peril, please.
Just a little bit of peril.
Running, yes.
Running the strunny.
Everyone would stay behind no exceptions for,
I am the only one that needs to be held back
and no wreathling left behind.
We all stand together.
Absolutely ogre.
Right, we're going to retry that one
because I really like that.
I like that one.
I think we can get an A.
I don't know if we can get full points
but I can do better than that
because I didn't realise with the arm
when I was supposed to go.
I mean, yeah, literally this is the first exercise
I've had since debut.
If you don't count cycling to the shop,
then she can't outward all of us.
Are you sure about that wreathling?
Literally, my only exercise was walks.
My dad took me to a cafe yesterday
and I cycled to the shops to get stuff.
That's all I've done.
Yeah, I thought that's about, oh my God.
Yeah, I'd like to find out.
All right, then you're on.
Fuck it.
All right, let's name a convention.
Where and when?
Once a week ring fit stream
so mommy doesn't become frail and weak, honestly.
I melt every time you do that.
It's unfair.
Aw.
Are you scared me right now?
Thank you for becoming.
Thank you for the extended membership.
Love you, love you too, love wreathling.
Thank you for the extended membership.

How the hell can she still be at ease

And then the poor attendant

Thank you, Violet-lover, for the super chat.
But no, I don't melt under the sunlight
in Australia because there's no sun
because it's winter.
It's summer for pretty much everyone else.
But the hemisphere flips it, okay?
So it's currently winter for me.
Looks like my name is Funtimes, though.

Shona on her hospital bed, please let me hold it.
I think that video is like 90K views or something,

I'm like, can you guys make one of the girls' meme videos
have that much views?
That'd be great.
Funtimes, I can't believe y'all got snow.
Or, or, yes, humid AF, it sucks.
There you go.
You know who else sucks?

Oh.
Oh.
Are you squidding me right now?
Oh.
I don't need.
That's all I ever wanted.
Did I beat my heart rate record?
Oh, I'm gonna throw up.
I hope not.
Oh, that's so good.
Oh.
Oh.
I am so out of it.
No.
I didn't.
I didn't beat my heart rate.
I squint my heart rate.
Are you joking?
Good job, mama.
You did amazing.
Now let us give you a nice little massage
all over your body to relax you.
I need a moment.
Hold it.
Hold it.
I am so waiting.
Are you fun?
I'm actually covered in so air.
I'll reach the bridge out
in just a moment.
I need a moment.
I need to recalibrate.
Oh, moment.
You're so close.
Just one.
Maybe I'm shy.
I feel like throwing up.
That's your body telling me to pump down.
Okay.
Okay.
I think we're okay.
Don't wanna throw up.
Oh.
Oh.
Are you squinting me right now?
I will read another one.
One more.
Mommy needs some.
Oh.
I feel sick after that.
Oh.
I went all low.
I don't know if you can tell,
but I went all low on that.
I'm not doing anymore.
That's me done.
I will feel very well right now.
I'm gonna be honest.
Is she beyond?
I'll see if I can redirect into Shiba.
I think I need to lie that.
I went too far.
Oh.
Where's my Shiba?
Oh.
Where's my Shiba?
Oh.
Shiba.
Wow.
I'm currently,
my body is trembling
and I don't know what that means.
Shiba's on the,
oh, she has,
she has, she's gone.
I think she's in her,
there is.
What?
Me?
No, no, no,
there is.
No, there isn't wrong with being a hag,
but no other ages.
I went too hard.
Are you guys okay if I redirect into Emi,
who's a couple of hours away?
I think I need to go lie down.
I don't feel very well after that.
Thank you.
Narrow, anonymous, anonymous.
And Seida,
who's a membership.
No, 30 minutes.
I mean,
Shibi's on holiday.
She's not here.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Are you okay?
I'm going to end.
I'm so sorry.
I don't feel very well.
I'll see you next time.
Goodbye.
Okay.
Love you.
I'll be okay.
Don't worry about me.
Yeah.
You're getting redirected in Emi.
She's a couple of hours away,
but she's there.
Sorry, Reflames.
I'm sorry.
