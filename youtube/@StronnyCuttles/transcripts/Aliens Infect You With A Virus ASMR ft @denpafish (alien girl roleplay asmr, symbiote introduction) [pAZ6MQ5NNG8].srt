1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,240
I think our patient is waking up. Now you better be gentle with them. Last time you made

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:26,040
the specimens heart rate go to 160 beats per minute which is outrageous. All while they

3
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:35,800
were lying down made I add. Humans are resilient but not perfect. They have obvious limitations.

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:44,600
You should make better notes when working directly with them. It also lowers aggressiveness

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:54,680
overall. There was that other incident where you resorted to using your tentacles to restrain

6
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:01,720
them and you were left with a nasty mark for a while until you're newly married to heal it.

7
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:08,800
No they missed out often but there is a reason I ask you to be a part of this particular humans

8
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:16,920
induction. In the case report here it says they didn't even resist. Looks like they are a deep

9
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:27,360
sleeper. Or some kind of insomnia. Or if they do find you get to sleep. It's so deep. They have no clue

10
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:35,080
what's going on around them. How fascinating. They can't just turn it on like a switch or a timer.

11
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:42,760
What intricate little things they make for their daily lives. It can't seem to fix themselves.

12
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:52,520
A shame. Well hopefully they will soon learn our ways are superior. Oh they're awake now.

13
00:01:53,800 --> 00:02:01,720
Hello dear specimen. Please do not pull on the first strange. That is fuel that will just

14
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:11,080
allow you to your heart rate. Relax. You are safe and in a serialized lab for lack of better words.

15
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:18,840
We are just running some boring guinea pig test on you and then from there you will be infected

16
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:27,800
with our virus and back to mingle with your own. Oh don't worry we are testing how rapidly humans

17
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:35,400
can be infected so if it doesn't go too well it's not like you failed. If anything the results are

18
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:45,160
very valuable or well they are to us anyway. With a little bit more bedside manners that

19
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:51,960
wasn't bad I think you will be fined to conduct some of these experiments on your own.

20
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,440
First human we do have to take some samples so that we have a baseline from when you started

21
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:09,160
and where you are in a month's time. Oh yeah we do have to recapture you but don't worry

22
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:17,640
you already have a tracker in you. We will be watching over you the whole time almost like an

23
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:27,240
angel. You humans do love the idea of something watching over you even if they are powerless but

24
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:40,520
this time well something very strong and powerful is caring for you. Who comforted and

25
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:46,440
trained you think? Let me just check over you real quickly.

26
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,800
It looks pretty alright to me.

27
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:15,080
Let me just prepare them for you.

28
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:32,360
Okay it's time to infect them. This one turned one bit I promise.

29
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:41,560
Our technology is unsprisingly a lot more advanced than you think. However the side effects are

30
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:51,960
rather curious. Most humans explain it like a weird lucid dream but it's rather favorable

31
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:58,280
due to the fact not a single soul will believe you when you explain this experience in detail.

32
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:07,000
How amazing.
