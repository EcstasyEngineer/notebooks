made having it no she has to be using the frickin radio between the eyes Azura I have a code phrase between the eyes over between the eyes what's that I think it's a hint for what you're to do something between the eyes over she's so cute I love her so much I was like all we're gonna breeze through this game don't worry I played it before I don't want to tell her what to do though I found symbols on a wall okay perfect tell me what these symbols are over I think this is the first one if I'm not mistaken yeah there's three there's three rows and at the top three it's the first time was like a circle with with a with the X across it and then one going in the middle okay Roger over huh so I have identified the symbol but I need a symbol along with that either an eye color pupil or a second shape over I love try hard in the video games what eye color pupils eye color pupil I have a green eye potentially a blue eye or a red eye over I have a red eye and a green eye red eye and a green eye do you need us can you touch symbols in a wall over I think I remember this one I'm cheating so much and you have a red left eye and a right green eye over I've just caught up her comes can you repeat that over is this where we find out can you repeat your last communication over a left red eye and a right green eye over okay symbols are someone having diarrhea and then the next symbol

green the first symbol is diarrhea a little but with diarrhea straight up line going down it and then the second symbol is an X a circle and a line going down over I thought it was a fancy tea like an oh maybe maybe an upside down umbrella might help her a bit better none of these look like diarrhea though other than that one little diarrhea can't it couldn't be me I'm constipated again I don't think you can click them all at once though only one at a time if so the diarrhea symbol or the upside down umbrella like it got blown in the wind is your first symbol I click that and then for your second symbol is a circle with a line down and an X through it over I got I got an achievement I think you did it over I did it you did it I got an achievement let's go oh new area unlocked for me

a a gate color or something I've balled this up I think I balled this up what gate what did I do so if she goes here she could close that green which closes that off and then she's locked in here so it can't be that she has to go back and open up this blue and then what go up here and then close that and then she can walk do that and then she can go in here do that which will lock that but then she can go all the way back and then close and then in and then open and in okay uh where are you Azura on any gate color the blue one okay can you go back to the white gate over hold on no it's blue um yes can you make your way to the white gate where you entered oh do you need I can tell you where to go if you're at the blue gate go south okay I'm back at the beginning okay right let's try that

she liked my Scottish accent coming out and she said when I'm angry it comes out really quickly and I'm like oh I see how it is Azura okay I'll wait for her to pull that lever I'll wait for her to communicate to me that she should be here is that the blue lever flicked over okay go north and then take a west this is about to time out I'm gonna very quickly do that and she just needs to go north and we do love the angry scores Azura is one of us try to get my Scottish readout take him west and then go north and she's doing fine is the monster there still I don't know I don't know where it is I don't know okay you're almost there you're doing great take an east and then you should go past the blue gate over me just casually reminding her there's a slug somewhere in the building although

first black pawn all the way up the board yes that's my zura this is still lost motherfucker let me out of here I'm like stuck in this library I have a book here with symbols on it oh I have books scattered around with symbols are you ready uh random um one um I have to explain these symbols I have books scattered around with five symbols although they mean any there's one with ears on it look like one with ears is icy which are pointy ears there and there's one with a little flag at the tip of a mountain and then a guy in a jacuzzi over yeah a guy in a jacuzzi and then there's a lantern with three circles three lights diamonds or circles over the heck is that she said some guy standing on a boat wait with one eyeball I mean that's exactly what she's just um as the fourth symbol got diamonds on the head and hands no it's just a lantern like it's definitely circles over and then like three three two sticking out of it on each side looks like the lamp like a lamp like Lumiere from Beauty and the Beast oh okay okay whoa whoa whoa um is icys head fucking massive for her body oh is icys head massive over icys head is decent these these medium is the hill humongous over oh big head with two arms sticking out yeah two tiny stick arms for the first symbol body half oval body half oval body I don't think this was the right one actually for the second symbol um is the hill like really massive over yeah it looks like a boom a boob no is it skinny I don't know what these books I can't remember what the freaking book stage was well these books are so similar to what she's explaining it could be this one um no it can't be that one because she said the last one's like a boat no it can't be that one either um can you input these symbols anywhere like uh I don't know what she needs me to do uh uh is it maybe down here that's the secret adrenaline is pumped okay so I walked onto a platform and it murdered me oh um okay I'm just I'm just trying to investigate what I can do for you murdered her I don't have any instructions when I look at these books though there's like it's just floor spears oh it only lets me give you the symbols I think I the floor where there are no spear I know what to do okay you need to explain the symbols in high detail okay did the symbols restart I'm to look at the back of the book no it's yes the symbols did in fact restart but they still look similar it's similar they are very similar on my end first one looks the same it's like a small like oval half oval body with two sticks sticking out like a snow oh you know like the snowman we the snowman one with the funny face what this one is now a face with the ears are we different is it a fat necko vtuber yes or no yes that's okay with pointy ears is the next one a medium pentus that has a little thing in his urethra over at this time with a line going through the mountain like it's like a scoop that is a pentus and just one singular tip pointing out that is a pentus pointing out that is a pentus as two big balls is it like a bird's eye view of the balls there's a guy in a tucuzi still their head is a oval like a flower is it squished over the the lantern has changed it now has three legs uh-huh yes that's not third leg is there three diamonds on the tips at the top okay i think i've got the right one for once with with with pointy with pointy pointy stick at the top yes yes not descending oh even when the sand is at the back and then a person standing on a boat they have a dress one eyeball with oval head actually really good was slightly bigger okay for the third symbol is oh she's a little hair on their head there's no hair on the head just a stick yeah there's one one one little stick one hair on the head one stick for the third symbol is the head of the man in the jacuzzi quite flat but still an oval over yeah flat flat and oval right i have the correct thing but you need to let me read all of it before you start moving okay okay okay now i'm going to read the instructions out loud do not do them until i've read the full thing and we've figured it out okay because this will keep resetting if we muck up in the western corner lies your start keep moving north but watch your step before the last tile you must head east after those these two steps take one step towards the south head for the eastern wall then you may proceed towards the door over so that so just so you comprehend we have to follow these steps in order over okay oh yeah okay yeah yeah yeah she has no fucking clue that's okay i love her okay and the western hemisphere is where you start so the first but don't stand on it okay just where you start okay she did she's talking but she's not talking at the very end yeah like to the left the west is where you start but don't stand on it okay okay is she okay i'm ready to stream snap okay i'm here but before the last tile you must head east wait how far east after these two okay i'm ready okay you are going to start going forwards but before the very last tile you must stop do not go on the last tile go on the second last tile north if that makes sense okay surely happy she's a happy happy are you on it yeah kind of over i'm there okay you must now go all the way east okay over copy i've seen copy not happy you must head east oh i meant east just by one tile oops i'm sorry ray let's try again let's try again are the symbols the same or different heaps head east one of course they didn't say head east multiple oh luckily they're the same oh is it the exact same i mean she ain't gonna complain if it's the exact same lucky okay let's try that again but this time i will not fill it up tea are you ready i'm ready on the most western corner is where you start i'm here go north but stop on the like second last one before the last gun now go east once gun take one step towards the south head for the eastern wall then you may proceed to the door take one step towards the south over i lied after these two steps one take one step towards the south did you go south or north you said south that's what the book says what do you say the book says after these two steps oh two steps as in physically two steps bro oh she went south oh my god i think it means two steps east brah i got played by english brah okay let's try that again brah i literally got played by english i hate the english language so much so what's the symbol is it the same it's not good it's the same you're very lucky no way is it actually yeah they're the same i love it here okay western wall let's go i've killed her so many times now right nothing can chase her you said two steps east right no right i'm going to read it out to you and then we can use our logic together okay she's talking but she's not okay right it says in the western corner lies your start so we'll go there i'm there keep moving north but watch your step before the last tail okay so don't go all the way north okay she's nodding she's nodding again okay now don't go anywhere read this with me okay before your last tail you must head east okay so you can go east one you don't die on east one okay then the book says after these two steps so you can go east twice question mark so go east one to what she's doing she's i don't know if i should go to that tile i think i died on the tile twice okay twice i just went one more step okay so you've gone east twice technically yes if i step on this child wait wait wait i died on this don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go oh don't go so from so from the western side you've gone east twice technically yes yes okay now it says take one step towards the south head to the eastern wall then you may proceed towards the door so i think you go south once then all the way east and then all the way that makes sense right over oh thank god i'm not doing that one again that was shite that's shite being Scottish that was awful fucking english why did they do english like that brave right i'm going in a okay this is the one where i can die i can see her model she has no idea what's going on she can hear it though there's a show and i'm being hunted and she has no idea i'm just gonna let her have fun she'll figure out she'll figure out it's fine he has to watch them so i am on the other side of the show a movie you are going to be pulling out scenes for me to watch uh uh uh um there should be a narration lever if i'm not mistaken there's gonna be a monster right behind me isn't there oh it's not there yet well he comes up soon there's a couple of lovers two levers forbidden for being fooled in a horror puzzle game there's a goat goddess and a kulfish and we have room temperature iq and i forget how the rest of the song goes but super hard puzzles super hard puzzles they're really difficult because they're super super super hard puzzles as they will get revenge there's the enemies sneaking up on me do you have a narration lever what's what's that what's in a what a lever it's a lever that literally has narration on it or maybe scene one something like that yeah it's a scene one on it if you pull it i think it gives you dialogue scene one or does it give me the dialogue and i'm to tell her what to do with that man i wish i could sit in the seats um to the left and the right there should be like three levers for her to pull how about you just pull everything out would you want to pull out a zero i didn't say that to her i was asking the reflings to be honest would you pull out of a zero i don't think you would you shouldn't all the girls are designed not to be pulled out of uh do you see levers that you can mess with yes i do one lever is broken though okay uh pull out of the other levers and i think i will be able to see what you're doing whoa Poseidon you didn't have to do that you goofy goober thank you for the redirect Poseidon did you have fun i'm pretty sure you're putting replay book one tcg if i'm not mistaken do you see that uh you'll need to pull it out more please i don't see anything hi raiders thank you Poseidon for the redirect i'm pretty sure Poseidon tweet she's like i'm playing more tcg like an absolute chad um i don't see anything happening on my end oh hold on a minute i'm a brain lit hold on pause jump okay what's this okay i'm an idiot oh there it is there once was a castle filled with life well i'm glad dessert didn't see this she would freak out bye okay what does that mean why is your creepy music playing uh because i'm being hunted right now but don't worry that's for me to worry about you just do a castle filled with life okay wait how am i supposed to do that what what do you mean you're being hunted it's fine it's fine i'm willing to die for you just pull a lever and make a castle full of life that's what that's what you've been given but hi uh Poseidon readers i'm strony calls from vlr the thought agency um Poseidon's awesome by the way if you didn't know she's like super cool and chill um just let you guys should know not that you already knew not that you didn't know you already knew that fill the castle with life literally she has no idea i'm getting hunted right now i think she would freak out seeing this if i'm being honest it's probably better in the end i did this side because i think is there would have a heart attack if she saw that no guess we go low and i is a little puppeteer type thing i saw Poseidon's yeah Poseidon got a 2.0 model recently i don't know if Azura knows what she better stop jingling a lingon wait why oh that like kills my pov can i like die if i get too close oh i won't let me actually get closer to him that's quite interesting it blocks me from getting closer it's definitely a marionette i do like creepy creepy marionette vtuber confirmed why am i supposed to do i don't know what to do um so you are sending out a play um and the cardboard cutouts are like a king a queen a castle the people and your prompt is there was a castle full of life there is a castle but there's only there's only i'm so dead i'm so dead but yes Poseidon got a 2.0 model if you didn't see it it was a that's very big not blood light not yet that's later can she not find all the six levers there's six levers there might be levers on the opposite side of the room i am so dead it's fine oh that was wrong well i didn't like that wherever that was it's okay it's okay i suck at video games i die in them all the time it's fine um um right there once was a castle full of life he got closer thank god i played this game before because i'm not gonna lie this is really creepy the first time you play there at the hotel or just pill stuff um just pill stuff all the way out if you can like a castle a king a queen and a crowed i'm just

handles am i being an idiot is that supposed to be watching this entire time i'm me just leaving her to do the guesswork what are you doing is this is this the castle um no you've pulled out in a marriage arch way it looks like i don't see anything else with a castle and except for those have you pulled the things all the way out i actually see like half of a king it's ogre it's so ogre

starting in the far west take two steps northbound head east twice then after moving north two times one can head for the door after taking one step towards the western wall okay now let's digest this starting in the far west so go to the west side but don't stand on it i will cry if she stands on it a little blind but i could not find that one okay take two steps north please don't die please don't die please don't die please don't die i'm dead head east twice please don't die please don't die please don't die then after moving north two times you have we got it you what you did it you did

Go north two times. Is this gonna kill her? I'm getting nervous. You got it? What's next? Fucking hell, you trying to make me calm? What the fuck? That's right, but to come to a fucking walkie-talkie, what the fuck is this? Right, one can head for the door after taking one step towards the dead west once. There's gonna be more than vibrations coming through this damn walkie-talkie, the fuck? Now you can head to the door after the western step you did. Oh my god. Oh yeah, that's our job. Soon give me literally less than a week. Okay, we can speedrun this. We know what to do. Are you ready? Okay. Yes, I'm ready. Okay. First up, towns, people, and castle only. Push, put, yep, all the way, all the way, all the way, all the way, all the way. One more, one more for the castle. The perfect towns, people, next. Let's speedrun this bitch. Push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, scene, scene, scene, scene. Beautiful, gorgeous, a garden, 10 out of 10. I just did that on the mic. Castle King, Queen all the way out, push, push, push, she just coughed in her mouth there, like a fucking toddler. Push castle more, castle more, more, more, more, until, almost, all the way, all the way, all the way, all the way, all that way. One more castle, one more castle, one more king, one more king, one more queen, otmer queen, one more King, King, King, King, King, King, King, King, King. Okay, scene. This must be so confusing on her end. Beautiful. All were happy and all was good. King, Queen, Castle, Townspeople. Push, push, push, push. I have absolutely no idea if that's the correct one. Push, push, push, push the castle. Push that castle. Teacher, yeah, yeah, teacher who's boss. That's right, King next. Fuck up that King. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah. Get that Queen in. Get that Queen in. Get them Townsfolk in. Yeah. Is she laughing? I think she's laughing. Okay, Townspeople, Townspeople. Bring them in, bring them in. Hey, hey, hey, celebrate with the King and Queen. More, more, more, more. Show those peasants what they're missing out on. Pill that scene. Pill that scene. Oh my God, we did it. We did it. King, Queen, that was Castle and Townspeople. Okay, now let's find out what's happening in this next scene. What's next? Until the King killed all he could, give me Evil King. Put the good King away. Boo, put the King away. Boo. We need Evil King now. I don't know which one the King is. Yep, perfect, perfect, all the way. Get rid of that. Boo. Right, now we need Evil King out. Evil King, Evil King. Oh, here he comes. Push, push, push him all the way out. Perfect, perfect. Oh, he's deranged, he's deranged. Okay, now we need the bloodlights in the back. You piss off, I'm working hard. Okay, scene. Until the King killed all he could. Oh, he's crazy. He's absolutely mental. He's deranged. Standing in blood, he probably said. Standing in blood, he proudly said, give me Blood King in Castle. Maybe Blood King in Light, and that's the Evil King in the Bloodlight. I think that might be it. Everyone away, Bloodlight on. Okay, perfect, and Bloodlight on and scene. No, no, that's the Bloodlight off, sorry. Pop that bad boy back on. And then pull scene. Shit, you might need to bring out the dead townspeople, I don't even know if that's possible. He just says. I don't think there's dead. Oh, oh, oh, sorry, bring out the normal King again. He just says standing in blood. Maybe one, maybe, can you bring out the Evil King any further? Sorry, see if you can wind him out any further. No, no, okay, maybe put Evil King away and bring out normal King, because he's just standing in blood, so with a Bloodlight. What's the stage four? Oh, I'm dying, ho ho ho, hurry up, Azura. Hee hee, love you, love you, Mummy, please, sorry, please don't let me die. Okay, perfect, and then put away Evil King. Yeah, yeah, yeah, go away, Evil King. You stink, boo, boo, thumbs down. Okay, pull scene. You did it! You did it, go down into the attic thing. What the fuck was that noise, God damn. Oh my God, that was a painful one I've dead met. Hey, see me, hi. You still have to talk to me through the walkie-talkie, though. Oh my God, oh, your walkie-talkie's just hovering. No, Azura, you might be the mother of all creations, okay? Of all life on this earth, so it's you who must go on. Go ahead, I will stand on the pressure plate and you will get freedom that you deserve. Your creations need you. Go forth, Azura, into the snow. What happened in you? It is the sacrifice I must make, for I am a siren. I take life, but you are the goddess of fertility you give. Go on forth to humanity. Give them the love they deserve. She went. No! You did it. Was there another way, question mark? That was amazing, you did it, Azura. Hee-hee-hee. You did it! You did it, that was fantastic, you did so well. You were worried about nothing. I don't think so. It was good, you did fantastic. Hee-hee-hee. Wait, what did you think? What did you think of that game type? Yes or no? I was, that was hard. I'm not good at puzzles at all. That, the last one was painful. I have to admit, that was really hard to figure out. Even, I've played the game before and I kind of knew what you were doing on your end and I still couldn't figure it out from the other perspective. So don't feel dumb, that was hard. It was hard as shit. I think I should study chessboards more. Well, I literally was calling the king, the queen at one point and then Refleens were like, that's the king you moron. I'm like, oh, okay, okay, I'll deal with it. So don't worry about it, don't worry about it. But there's like a whole series on the WiiWare here. I think there's now four installments of the franchise. And for some reason, on the very last installment of this game, they made it so unbelievably hard and difficult for no reason. And all the other ones? Yeah, so I've been lucky enough to play them with other VTubers and another life team. And the fourth installment is impossible without cheating. I refuse to believe anyone naturally came up with one of the answers in them. But if you ever wanted to give another one a shot, I'm right here, Azura. But I don't know if puzzles are your thing. Well, I don't know if they're your thing. They're not my thing, I'm dumb. Oh, that's adorable though, I loved it. I'm sorry about scaring you about the monster in the maze. I'm going to be honest, the monster can't get you in the maze. I was just waning you up, I'm sorry. That's what you get for waning me up in among us. We were talking before the stream and she was like, I purposely picked on you to hear that Scottish accent. I'm like, Azura, you're not supposed to say that. She's like, oh, because I was like, oh, I don't get angry or frustrated. And she was like, the among us club. And I'm like, you know what? You've actually got me there. I got caught red. You caught me. You caught me. You got me, I'm not going to lie. It was funny. Or you got so mad, she'd vote me off immediately. And then I wasn't even the imposter and then she'd get. I always, if someone, if anyone picks on me, I'm like, instantly you're the imposter because you're worried I'm going to snuff you out. And then obviously I think I booted you off once and you were innocent. And then everyone was like, you're gilly strong. And I'm like, no, no, Azura is starting then. You started. I'm going to end it. I was so scared. That was so good. Thank you so much for playing with me and enjoyed myself thoroughly. Are you streaming after this or is that you done for today? Because I don't know if I should be direct into year or not. I'm done for today. I'm probably just going to chat with my stream for a little bit. Yes, OK. I say a little bit, but it's probably going to be for like two hours. They didn't call you yet for calling for nothing around these parts. OK, let me make sure I'm redirecting into year. Because I don't want to not direct into year. But that was so fun. Please, if you ever wanted to play more of those, I enjoy those games totally not because I've played them before and they're not impossible. Tee, tee. If I played them fresh, I'd be a lot more nervous because I'm like, um, but I think we did OK. I was nervous. You were going to get upset that I was so dumb. No, I would never get upset at you for no good. I mean, like, I was. Don't get off the puzzle forever. Oh, bro. That last puzzle killed us. Not going to lie. Everything else. I don't want this puzzle that I ever. We blitzed through. The longest puzzle. The longest puzzle I've ever gotten stuck on was like for literally two days straight. And what? I'd just cheat at that point. It was. I don't think you can cheat, though. Like, yeah, you can cheat to find out what you have to do. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You have to actually time it. It was like a timing puzzle. And I could never get the timing, right? No, I don't like that kind of stuff. And apparently there's a game called Labyrinth Co-op Horror Puzzle. I'm not sure if I can put the girls up for that. I was freaking Azura pretending a slug was going to grab her. I don't know how I should respond to a game like that. I scream. Terrible. Right. I am going to redirect into Azura, because unfortunately I do have a few things to do today. And thank you so, so much for playing me. That was a hoot and a holler. I'm going to redirect into you. Reeflings, be lovely to the bleeding hearts. I'm bleeding hearts. Thanks for having me as well on your end of things, Azura. I will redirect into you. Thank you so, so much. I give everyone kisses.
