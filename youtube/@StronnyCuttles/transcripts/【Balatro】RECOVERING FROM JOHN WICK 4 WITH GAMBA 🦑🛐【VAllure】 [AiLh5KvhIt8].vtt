00:00.000 --> 00:22.760
It's really bizarre for a full minute, no one can hear me, but then it's fine, I don't

00:22.760 --> 00:23.760
know.

00:24.360 --> 00:25.360
It's rather bizarre.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.360
Rather bizarre indeed.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.360
Oh my God, I got so many comments on my YouTube.

00:38.360 --> 00:39.360
Hold on a minute.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.160
It's just so over for the moment.

00:45.760 --> 00:46.760
I'm spilling.

00:47.960 --> 00:48.960
Okay.

00:51.360 --> 00:52.360
Wait, hold on.

00:53.760 --> 00:56.160
The frickin' Reflins joined membership.

00:56.160 --> 00:57.160
Hold on a minute.

00:57.160 --> 01:00.160
Link322 and Stalkin.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.160
Thank you for the memberships.

01:02.160 --> 01:05.160
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

01:05.160 --> 01:07.160
Can you guys finally see me?

01:07.160 --> 01:09.160
Is it going to register that you guys can see?

01:09.160 --> 01:10.160
Oh thank goodness.

01:10.160 --> 01:12.160
It takes so long for that, right?

01:12.160 --> 01:15.160
Reflins, Reflins, Reflins.

01:15.160 --> 01:19.160
I know normally at any minute we're throwing fists, we're fighting.

01:19.160 --> 01:23.160
I have a very serious, very incredibly.

01:23.560 --> 01:26.560
This is life or death for my channel.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.560
I'm not being funny.

01:28.560 --> 01:30.560
This is life or death for my channel.

01:30.560 --> 01:31.560
What pose?

01:31.560 --> 01:34.560
What pose do you want me pregnant with you?

01:34.560 --> 01:37.560
What pose do you want to be in my tummy in?

01:37.560 --> 01:39.560
This is life or death.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.560
Life or death for this channel.

01:41.560 --> 01:46.560
This channel will pivot and not survive if we do not do this.

01:46.560 --> 01:47.560
Hold on.

01:47.560 --> 01:48.560
I'm opening up a poll.

01:48.560 --> 01:49.560
Hold on.

01:49.560 --> 01:50.560
Hold the phone.

01:50.560 --> 01:53.560
I'm opening up a poll as we speak.

01:53.560 --> 01:57.560
I will change the thumbnail soon TM, but it is so important.

01:57.560 --> 01:58.560
Hold on.

01:58.560 --> 01:59.560
Poll.

01:59.560 --> 02:00.560
Start poll.

02:00.560 --> 02:05.560
What pose for you in my tum tum in my tum tum?

02:05.560 --> 02:09.560
As I spelled that terribly wrong, tum tum.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.560
Pose one.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.560
Pose two.

02:13.560 --> 02:14.560
That's right.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.560
Don't ever say.

02:16.560 --> 02:19.560
Don't ever say you don't eat well at VEAL or headquarters.

02:19.560 --> 02:21.560
I don't want to hear it.

02:21.560 --> 02:22.560
I don't want to hear it.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.560
How am I making this worse?

02:25.560 --> 02:29.560
Literally, you decide the fate of my channel with this one pose alone.

02:29.560 --> 02:30.560
Go.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.560
What pose for you in my tum tum?

02:33.560 --> 02:34.560
You must vote.

02:34.560 --> 02:35.560
Four.

02:35.560 --> 02:36.560
Phil Nelson.

02:36.560 --> 02:41.560
I mean, your technicals can be extended, but the Phil Nelson.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.560
You get too early to do the poll.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.560
More people need to join the stream.

02:46.560 --> 02:49.560
I mean, I stream every single time, at the same time every day.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.560
Bar one day before anyone's like,

02:51.560 --> 02:53.560
Actually, you were the last bell to stream.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.560
You were two hours late.

02:55.560 --> 02:56.560
Actually, no.

02:56.560 --> 02:59.560
I was doing a meeting and everyone's happy and the marshmallows are coming back.

02:59.560 --> 03:05.560
So if you want to send any nice marshmallows to the girls, please be my guest.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.560
Be my guest.

03:09.560 --> 03:11.560
Be my guest.

03:11.560 --> 03:12.560
My guest.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.560
You're welcome to be my guest.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.560
Let's see.

03:17.560 --> 03:18.560
Let's see.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.560
This is what you're drinking.

03:20.560 --> 03:21.560
Cola.

03:21.560 --> 03:24.560
Oh, it's cola.

03:24.560 --> 03:26.560
Wait, is it vote?

03:26.560 --> 03:35.560
Whoa, we have a unanimous, unanimous vote of pose three.

03:35.560 --> 03:40.560
I will relay that to the artist as we speak.

03:40.560 --> 03:53.560
The reeflings have kindly decided that pose three is the most voted for by far.

03:53.560 --> 04:01.560
I would love to see that pose further developed for this commission.

04:01.560 --> 04:05.560
Thank you so much for working so quickly.

04:05.560 --> 04:11.560
Because I didn't realise I was going to get an update so quickly on these options.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.560
I didn't even know I was going to get options.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.560
I sent away a little reference sheet.

04:15.560 --> 04:17.560
Do you want to see the reference sheet?

04:17.560 --> 04:19.560
It's pretty funny.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.560
Right, sorry.

04:21.560 --> 04:25.560
The reeflings have kindly decided that pose three is the most voted for by far.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.560
I would love to see that pose further developed in this commission.

04:28.560 --> 04:35.560
Thank you so much for working on these options and giving me choices.

04:35.560 --> 04:40.560
This has been a fantastic experience so far.

04:40.560 --> 04:47.560
I am very lucky to have found you as an artist.

04:47.560 --> 04:51.560
And before anyone's like, oh, your voice sounds sarcastic when you're typing that.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.560
No, I mean it.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.560
This is what I sent away.

04:55.560 --> 04:59.560
I did not expect at all to get...

04:59.560 --> 05:02.560
Hold on, so that's the image there.

05:02.560 --> 05:10.560
I did not at all expect to get opportunities to even pick a pose further than what I had submitted.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.560
Where the fuck is the image that I just saved?

05:13.560 --> 05:15.560
Oh no. Where is it?

05:15.560 --> 05:17.560
Hold on a minute.

05:17.560 --> 05:20.560
Save image as on desktop is...

05:20.560 --> 05:24.560
It's on the desktop. I can see it when I go to save it again.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.560
There we go.

05:26.560 --> 05:30.560
This is what I sent away the reference as.

05:30.560 --> 05:34.560
This is what...

05:34.560 --> 05:36.560
How else end that pose?

05:36.560 --> 05:38.560
Good morning.

05:38.560 --> 05:40.560
That's what I sent away.

05:40.560 --> 05:42.560
Come on, don't laugh.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.560
I was like, oh come on, got my little reefling.

05:44.560 --> 05:48.560
We got our little placenta line going.

05:48.560 --> 05:52.560
So placenta actually attaches...

05:52.560 --> 05:57.560
I think the placenta sits at any part of the wall in theory.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.560
It can go anywhere.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.560
And I was like, did we put it at the top of the womb?

06:01.560 --> 06:03.560
And I was like, you know what?

06:03.560 --> 06:05.560
No, it can attach at any point.

06:05.560 --> 06:08.560
So we'll just do a straight line coming from my wee reefling.

06:08.560 --> 06:11.560
But yeah, that's the reference I sent away.

06:11.560 --> 06:16.560
And then they very, very kindly gave us those four options.

06:16.560 --> 06:19.560
Those three options, pardon.

06:19.560 --> 06:22.560
And then, yeah, you guys picked three.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.560
So I'm gonna be pregnant with you.

06:25.560 --> 06:28.560
Are you ready to be in my tummy?

06:28.560 --> 06:31.560
I was gonna write the script together.

06:31.560 --> 06:34.560
And then I can say all the adorable things.

06:34.560 --> 06:38.560
I also caught up with my dad and told him how awesome you guys are.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.560
And I was like, dad, guess who played Microsoft?

06:41.560 --> 06:44.560
And he was like, shut the front door.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.560
And I was like, hell, yeah, I didn't.

06:46.560 --> 06:51.560
And I told, I was like, I was telling him about how you used to absolutely wreck and deck.

06:51.560 --> 06:57.560
Also, apparently our Canadian pot smoker isn't called grizzle.

06:57.560 --> 06:59.560
It's gristle. Oops.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.560
So it's gristle.

07:01.560 --> 07:04.560
If you're out there, one Canadian gristle.

07:04.560 --> 07:07.560
Sorry, I've got your gamer tag wrong.

07:07.560 --> 07:11.560
My dad was, oh, he should have seen the disgust on his face when I was like,

07:11.560 --> 07:14.560
oh, I gave a shout out to gristle and everything.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.560
And he was, oh, oh, wrong gamer tag.

07:17.560 --> 07:21.560
Oh, sorry. I wasn't even like two years old at this point.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.560
Like, oh, sorry.

07:23.560 --> 07:24.560
Close enough.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.560
Did you tell him we're getting top seven?

07:26.560 --> 07:28.560
He was laughing at that so hard.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.560
He was like, wait, because no one submitted for it.

07:30.560 --> 07:33.560
And I was like, yeah, because it's such an old game.

07:33.560 --> 07:38.560
But I told him we made VTuber history because I'm the first VTuber to play Microsoft.

07:38.560 --> 07:40.560
Like 99.9% sure.

07:40.560 --> 07:44.560
Unless there's some obscure person hidden in the YouTube algorithm,

07:44.560 --> 07:48.560
we made VTuber history by being the first person to play Microsoft.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.560
So, feels good, man.

07:50.560 --> 07:54.560
I also told them that I've not submitted my note.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.560
I should though, just for the hell of it.

07:56.560 --> 08:01.560
Fuck it. I will. I will. I'll do it after the stream because this is a cool downstream.

08:01.560 --> 08:04.560
If you didn't know, we're not actually playing

08:05.560 --> 08:07.560
Cooking Simulator

08:07.560 --> 08:10.560
or Women Simulator, whatever you want to call it, your choice.

08:11.560 --> 08:14.560
I may or may not be absolutely distraught.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.560
I'm actually going to update the stream thumbnail right now

08:17.560 --> 08:19.560
because I think people generally think I'm sitting on...

08:19.560 --> 08:21.560
Oh, if you heard that.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.560
Oh, my PC didn't like that.

08:23.560 --> 08:26.560
Right, let's pop away the pregnancy for now.

08:26.560 --> 08:29.560
Because I've got something else I want to show you.

08:30.560 --> 08:34.560
Because the streams start coming and they don't stop coming

08:34.560 --> 08:37.560
and the streams start coming and they don't stop coming

08:37.560 --> 08:40.560
and they beg to the room and they hit the ground running.

08:40.560 --> 08:42.560
Didn't make sense not to stretch the bandwidth

08:42.560 --> 08:46.560
because we keep on gaming, but we keep on gaming.

08:46.560 --> 08:52.560
So much to do, so much to see, so much to game, so much to do, so much to game.

08:53.560 --> 08:56.560
Mate, the name of this stream is going to be recovering from

08:56.560 --> 09:02.560
John Wick for Wiccamba.

09:03.560 --> 09:06.560
Remember that time? Do you remember what happened yesterday?

09:06.560 --> 09:08.560
Yeah, I remember. I still remember.

09:08.560 --> 09:10.560
Very vividly what happened.

09:10.560 --> 09:15.560
Not to be confused with vividly, oh, some more, the streamer.

09:16.560 --> 09:21.560
Okay, that should update.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.560
I hope it has felt cultural, right?

09:23.560 --> 09:29.560
Yes, we are going to start the GamerScore grind.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.560
So, things are going to...

09:31.560 --> 09:34.560
We're going to start doing the Xbox GamerScore grind,

09:34.560 --> 09:36.560
starting off with Cameo.

09:36.560 --> 09:41.560
Now, I know we've still got Binding of Isaac tomorrow

09:41.560 --> 09:43.560
and a membership stream of Iron Man.

09:43.560 --> 09:45.560
Guinness, I'm not going to greet during that.

09:45.560 --> 09:48.560
My eyes are still puffy.

09:48.560 --> 09:50.560
Those window noises jump-scared me.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.560
I'm sorry, it was me, it was me.

09:52.560 --> 09:56.560
My PC doesn't like when I download an image for some reason.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.560
It gets all up its arse.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.560
Honestly, it gets its wee panties and leaves in the cliffs

10:01.560 --> 10:04.560
and I'm like, hmm, it needs to be with me.

10:04.560 --> 10:10.560
But yes, we're going to try Stray.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.560
Apparently, it's five hours long.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.560
Cameo is roughly eight hours split,

10:14.560 --> 10:17.560
so I'm going to try and be a bit easier on myself

10:17.560 --> 10:19.560
with these endurance streams,

10:19.560 --> 10:21.560
especially because there's a few things...

10:21.560 --> 10:22.560
Oh, a secret.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.560
Thank you for the five gifted memberships.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.560
Congrats to those who caught it with their face.

10:27.560 --> 10:31.560
Make sure to interact with chat

10:31.560 --> 10:33.560
because I think there's a prompt that says

10:33.560 --> 10:35.560
to accept GIFs on channels for some reason.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.560
It just doesn't happen automatically.

10:37.560 --> 10:38.560
I don't know.

10:38.560 --> 10:45.560
But, yes, what am I doing?

10:45.560 --> 10:46.560
I don't know.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.560
Oh my God, it's officially...

10:48.560 --> 10:49.560
Hold on, wait.

10:49.560 --> 10:52.560
I might even have a further thing to show you

10:52.560 --> 10:57.560
if I have it, if it's lurking in the shadows.

10:57.560 --> 10:58.560
Yes, there is...

10:58.560 --> 11:00.560
Oh, I do have it, I do have it.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.560
Okay, you might hear the windows sound.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.560
It's my computer, not yours.

11:04.560 --> 11:05.560
It's my computer.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.560
Okay, it's my computer.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.560
One last thing to show you,

11:09.560 --> 11:12.560
and then we'll get Gambon to make myself feel better.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.560
Wow, I've spoken like a true addict.

11:14.560 --> 11:15.560
Holy crap.

11:15.560 --> 11:18.560
It has been...

11:18.560 --> 11:20.560
Why is it locked?

11:20.560 --> 11:22.560
Unlock yourself right now.

11:22.560 --> 11:27.560
It has been almost one month of streams,

11:27.560 --> 11:29.560
and here we are, a little refluence.

11:29.560 --> 11:30.560
Here we are.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.560
Can you tell?

11:32.560 --> 11:35.560
I like streaming, question mark.

11:35.560 --> 11:38.560
I'll swap out the runescape key.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.560
But it's been one month.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.560
I'm going to tweet this out.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.560
I'm going to tweet it out with my YouTube statistics

11:44.560 --> 11:46.560
and just be like, thank you for anyone

11:46.560 --> 11:50.560
and everyone who interacted with me.

11:50.560 --> 11:55.560
It has been nothing short of a complete pleasure

11:55.560 --> 11:57.560
to be able to do this.

11:57.560 --> 12:00.560
Nothing short of a complete pleasure,

12:00.560 --> 12:03.560
pure happiness, pure, pure vibes,

12:03.560 --> 12:05.560
whatever you want to call it.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.560
It has been nothing but fantastic.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.560
I'm very happy.

12:09.560 --> 12:10.560
Those are all the streams.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.560
I will swap out the part five for my new one

12:13.560 --> 12:16.560
because technically I didn't do the part five runescape.

12:16.560 --> 12:22.560
But yes, we are in, please do not be mistaken

12:22.560 --> 12:25.560
in thinking that, oh no, it's going to slow down now.

12:25.560 --> 12:27.560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

12:27.560 --> 12:29.560
Mommy built different.

12:29.560 --> 12:31.560
I can't believe it's already been a dad stream

12:31.560 --> 12:33.560
more than some streamers in a year, be honest.

12:33.560 --> 12:35.560
Hold on, let me take a drink of cola

12:35.560 --> 12:37.560
and then let me finish off my tea.

12:44.560 --> 12:49.560
But yes, I have had an absolutely fantastic month.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.560
I'm sure all the girls will absolutely agree

12:51.560 --> 12:54.560
and say we've had just beyond immeasurable

12:55.560 --> 12:57.560
happiness success.

12:57.560 --> 13:00.560
When I go off of stream, like once I finish this stream,

13:00.560 --> 13:04.560
everyone's debut highlights are going up as well.

13:04.560 --> 13:07.560
I'm going to put some advertising money back

13:07.560 --> 13:10.560
and behind it as well just to help the girls out

13:10.560 --> 13:14.560
with their growth because I've got a goal

13:14.560 --> 13:16.560
for them to achieve this month

13:16.560 --> 13:18.560
and obviously I need to enable them.

13:18.560 --> 13:22.560
I need to enable their human, I was going to say

13:22.560 --> 13:24.560
I was going to say humidities

13:24.560 --> 13:27.560
for the implication of cookies.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.560
I don't know why.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.560
It only goes even faster from here.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.560
The second thumbnail exposing VLR.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.560
Oh, did you like it?

13:36.560 --> 13:38.560
Thanks, I made it myself.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.560
I'm just so good.

13:40.560 --> 13:42.560
I'm just so MLG Pro, honestly.

13:42.560 --> 13:46.560
Oh, that's my game capture, please don't.

13:46.560 --> 13:50.560
Wait, my game capture is in mine.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.560
It's because I'm dumb.

13:53.560 --> 13:56.560
But yes, it's been a fantastic month.

13:56.560 --> 13:59.560
Next month, I'm going to be pregnant with you in my belly.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.560
Next month, my...

14:01.560 --> 14:04.560
Right, actually hold on, hold on, let's discuss this.

14:04.560 --> 14:08.560
While we're busy fighting and off all the time,

14:08.560 --> 14:12.560
I actually do need to discuss the length of streams

14:12.560 --> 14:15.560
coming up in Dru...

14:15.560 --> 14:17.560
Where the frick?

14:18.560 --> 14:21.560
I now have two of these.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.560
Am I okay?

14:23.560 --> 14:25.560
I don't think so.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.560
Okay, well, if it's that one,

14:28.560 --> 14:31.560
right, we need to discuss

14:31.560 --> 14:33.560
or we need to bring about.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.560
So my dad's coming over, I'm not hitting the fact.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.560
My dad's coming.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.560
My dad's coming to see me.

14:40.560 --> 14:43.560
So, why does time go faster every year?

14:43.560 --> 14:45.560
Isn't that not like a relatively...

14:45.560 --> 14:48.560
Fainting the finished Elden Ring DLC?

14:48.560 --> 14:51.560
Oh yeah, you're going to carry me later when we play it again.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.560
I've never played Spiral.

14:57.560 --> 15:00.560
I think I might have played it as a child,

15:00.560 --> 15:02.560
but I do not remember it.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.560
I think maybe my dad played it, but even he said,

15:04.560 --> 15:06.560
like, I'm not even sure about that.

15:06.560 --> 15:08.560
And I'm like, maybe I just made it up

15:08.560 --> 15:10.560
and watched people play it as a child.

15:10.560 --> 15:13.560
Your dad, yeah, you're going to meet your father-in-law.

15:13.560 --> 15:15.560
I'm not sure.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.560
I might bring him on stream for like five seconds,

15:17.560 --> 15:19.560
but all you're going to hear is

15:19.560 --> 15:21.560
for the love of effing God.

15:21.560 --> 15:23.560
Do not say my legal name, my name is Strani.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.560
Okay, don't say anything.

15:25.560 --> 15:27.560
And he'll be like, hi, Radish boys.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.560
And I'm like, no, they're called Raeflings, dad!

15:29.560 --> 15:31.560
Raeflings!

15:31.560 --> 15:33.560
Mail on stream.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.560
Oh, for fuck's sake.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.560
Then he start mail on stream if it's my dad.

15:37.560 --> 15:40.560
I will fucking have a riot.

15:42.560 --> 15:45.560
If someone fucking goes mail on stream,

15:45.560 --> 15:48.560
drop, because my fucking dad shows up on stream.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.560
Oh my God, I'm fighting phantoms right now.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.560
I'm ready to swing on my chair.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.560
I'm fighting phantoms.

15:54.560 --> 15:56.560
Lou phantoms dans ma chambre.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.560
Chambre, fuck.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.560
Man, I'm such a fake Frenchie.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.560
New nickname, we're Radish boys.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.560
It was your old nickname.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.560
It was your old nickname

16:10.560 --> 16:12.560
when you were in the cryo pod,

16:12.560 --> 16:14.560
but now you're called Raeflings, r-e-e-e-e.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.560
Raeflings.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.560
Already fighting them visibly,

16:18.560 --> 16:20.560
but literally the phantom's in my room right now.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.560
The phantom's dans ma chambre,

16:22.560 --> 16:24.560
in my room, in my bedroom,

16:24.560 --> 16:26.560
and to be specific.

16:28.560 --> 16:30.560
Mmm.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.560
Yes, but for the next

16:32.560 --> 16:34.560
three weeks,

16:34.560 --> 16:36.560
ash,

16:36.560 --> 16:38.560
there's not going to be too many

16:38.560 --> 16:40.560
endurance streams, because

16:40.560 --> 16:42.560
so my dad said the first few days

16:42.560 --> 16:44.560
he's going to not even be

16:44.560 --> 16:46.560
on the same time zone.

16:46.560 --> 16:48.560
I don't even know if he's going to be awake.

16:48.560 --> 16:50.560
He's probably going to be awake while I'm streaming.

16:50.560 --> 16:52.560
Oh my God, oh he's going to be here

16:52.560 --> 16:54.560
and has like all our ridiculous conversations.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.560
Um, but it's fine.

16:56.560 --> 16:58.560
It's fine.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.560
My dad laughs

17:00.560 --> 17:02.560
and he finds it funny.

17:02.560 --> 17:04.560
You can just pre-record a segment.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.560
Probably. The phantom's have got

17:06.560 --> 17:08.560
to fight my mental illness.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.560
Bro, I'm pheromone maxing right now.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.560
I'm fucking disgusting. I'm so greasy.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.560
I smell V.O.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.560
I was going to have a shower

17:16.560 --> 17:18.560
after John went.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.560
Uh, the reason why I don't have any news

17:20.560 --> 17:22.560
other than what I've just shown

17:22.560 --> 17:24.560
is because I did nothing yesterday

17:24.560 --> 17:26.560
after the stream. I was so distraught.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.560
I was so distraught. I didn't have

17:28.560 --> 17:30.560
a shower. I went to bed.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.560
I had a nap. I woke up.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.560
I ended up binging to

17:34.560 --> 17:36.560
TikTok for four hours.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.560
Um, I'm literally pheromone maxing

17:38.560 --> 17:40.560
right now and then I went back to sleep

17:40.560 --> 17:42.560
because I felt so bad after

17:42.560 --> 17:44.560
watching that film.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.560
Uh,

17:46.560 --> 17:48.560
so let's just say no emotional

17:48.560 --> 17:50.560
films. No films I have any

17:50.560 --> 17:52.560
emotional little

17:52.560 --> 17:54.560
things.

17:54.560 --> 17:56.560
Literally I didn't even eat. I've still not eaten

17:56.560 --> 17:58.560
since I had the past, was it

17:58.560 --> 18:00.560
pasta? Left over pasta with you

18:00.560 --> 18:02.560
yesterday. On Rinscape

18:02.560 --> 18:04.560
that's the last time I've eaten because I've

18:04.560 --> 18:06.560
been so distraught.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.560
I'm such a cry baby.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.560
I can't even eat.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.560
Um,

18:12.560 --> 18:14.560
no I'm not even hungry. That's the thing.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.560
Thank you Jake Norman for coming

18:16.560 --> 18:18.560
out. Member!

18:18.560 --> 18:20.560
Uh, our membership streams for the week.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.560
Classic script writing. You guys are going to tell me what you want to hear again.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.560
We're going to do a

18:24.560 --> 18:26.560
the plot has already been picked out slightly.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.560
Um, it's going to be a choose your own

18:28.560 --> 18:30.560
adventure kind of plot.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.560
But we will be

18:32.560 --> 18:34.560
publicly writing

18:34.560 --> 18:36.560
ASMR collabs with

18:36.560 --> 18:38.560
VR.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.560
I have five one-on-one collabs planned

18:40.560 --> 18:42.560
with the girls. I'm not even told the girls yet.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.560
Uh, I'm just doing it. I'm just bombing into their DMs

18:44.560 --> 18:46.560
being like hey, how's it going?

18:46.560 --> 18:48.560
Actually, out of raw

18:48.560 --> 18:50.560
curiosity did that Rinscape stream

18:50.560 --> 18:52.560
get limited ads for

18:52.560 --> 18:54.560
the language I was using

18:54.560 --> 18:56.560
because there was no in-game audio or voices.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.560
Wow!

18:58.560 --> 19:00.560
My John Wick stream was fine.

19:00.560 --> 19:02.560
I literally constantly went

19:02.560 --> 19:04.560
and said

19:04.560 --> 19:06.560
pretty

19:06.560 --> 19:08.560
pretty outrageous stuff.

19:08.560 --> 19:10.560
Not going to lie.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.560
The banks were mentioned at one point

19:12.560 --> 19:14.560
and then the banks became the high table.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.560
So from now on

19:16.560 --> 19:18.560
the high table is how we

19:18.560 --> 19:20.560
reference the banks, okay?

19:20.560 --> 19:22.560
Um,

19:22.560 --> 19:24.560
eat when you're ready and hungry.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.560
Yeah.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.560
I'm fine. No, no, that's fine.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.560
She's sad girl Maxine for real, for real.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.560
Um, if you

19:32.560 --> 19:34.560
didn't make it for yesterday's stream

19:34.560 --> 19:36.560
um,

19:36.560 --> 19:38.560
I want to say John Wick

19:38.560 --> 19:40.560
spoilers.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.560
Maybe?

19:42.560 --> 19:44.560
Uh, is it for the first 30 minutes

19:44.560 --> 19:46.560
you're not allowed to say anything bad? Well, I'm pretty sure

19:46.560 --> 19:48.560
like I was just straight out coming out

19:48.560 --> 19:50.560
with the sentences like we should be

19:50.560 --> 19:52.560
where the banks and stuff and I'm like

19:52.560 --> 19:54.560
hold on a minute, isn't usually going to have problems

19:54.560 --> 19:56.560
with us?

19:56.560 --> 19:58.560
Yeah, I think I know.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.560
I'm going to finish that

20:00.560 --> 20:02.560
in the movie. I had to put, oh.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.560
Okay, I'm not spoiling nothing.

20:04.560 --> 20:06.560
If you've not watched John Wick

20:06.560 --> 20:08.560
if you've not

20:08.560 --> 20:10.560
watched John Wick, you're welcome to watch me

20:10.560 --> 20:12.560
um, create

20:12.560 --> 20:14.560
Wines whilst watching the movie.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.560
Um, do not whatever you do

20:16.560 --> 20:18.560
up to the end of the VOD

20:18.560 --> 20:20.560
for any reason, even though

20:20.560 --> 20:22.560
the movie isn't displayed in the stream

20:22.560 --> 20:24.560
uh, you'll be able to hear in my voice

20:24.560 --> 20:26.560
what happened.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.560
Uh, should know. Don't, don't do that.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.560
Don't do that. Uh, yes. So there's going to be

20:30.560 --> 20:32.560
a few shorter streams but

20:32.560 --> 20:34.560
with these shorter streams that are coming up in

20:34.560 --> 20:36.560
July there's going to be a lot more

20:36.560 --> 20:38.560
consistency, I repeat a lot more

20:38.560 --> 20:40.560
consistency with ASMR uploads.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.560
So it's like a reward

20:42.560 --> 20:44.560
less mummy equals more mummy

20:44.560 --> 20:46.560
more mummy equals less mummy.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.560
Yeah?

20:48.560 --> 20:50.560
That makes sense.

20:50.560 --> 20:52.560
There's the, there's more of me.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.560
There's, okay, this, I don't know

20:56.560 --> 20:58.560
why this didn't pop, but here we go.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.560
Re-roll the shop a total of

21:00.560 --> 21:02.560
100 times and we've got Re-rolls

21:02.560 --> 21:04.560
cost 2 bucks left. Didn't we not already have

21:04.560 --> 21:06.560
that?

21:06.560 --> 21:08.560
Play a total of 300. Wait, why is

21:08.560 --> 21:10.560
this popping now? Re-face

21:10.560 --> 21:12.560
all, uh

21:12.560 --> 21:14.560
Re-triggers all played face cards.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.560
That's a curious one.

21:16.560 --> 21:18.560
That could be used in combination.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.560
Spend a total of 2.5 in the shops.

21:20.560 --> 21:22.560
Woah!

21:22.560 --> 21:24.560
One extra card slot

21:24.560 --> 21:26.560
available in the shop. That's curious.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.560
It doesn't make sense, but more mummy

21:28.560 --> 21:30.560
means more happy. Yes, there's a

21:30.560 --> 21:32.560
few things I wish to execute this month.

21:32.560 --> 21:34.560
Wow, uh, as an

21:34.560 --> 21:36.560
execute plans, not as an execute

21:36.560 --> 21:38.560
the high table.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.560
Um,

21:40.560 --> 21:42.560
planets appear 4 times more

21:42.560 --> 21:44.560
likely. Buy a total.

21:44.560 --> 21:46.560
Okay. Wow!

21:46.560 --> 21:48.560
Jeez, Louise!

21:48.560 --> 21:50.560
First thing in the morning

21:50.560 --> 21:52.560
you want to do that to me? Right.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.560
Dev's getting a message right now.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.560
Dev's getting a message. Continue!

22:00.560 --> 22:02.560
Oh, uh, I think

22:02.560 --> 22:04.560
this is, uh, yeah, we've got our token.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.560
We've got our token.

22:06.560 --> 22:08.560
Um, we won, we won, we won.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.560
That's the main thing. Okay.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.560
Well, actually, I've got a f***ing force behind me.

22:14.560 --> 22:16.560
So today we're having an easy day.

22:16.560 --> 22:18.560
When I get off stream, all the girls are going to have

22:18.560 --> 22:20.560
highlights, um,

22:20.560 --> 22:22.560
uploaded, debut highlights

22:22.560 --> 22:24.560
uploaded to their channel.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.560
I'm also going to put some advertisement in it.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.560
Uh, I'm not putting any advertisement

22:28.560 --> 22:30.560
in me. This is actually just straight up

22:30.560 --> 22:32.560
internal veiler.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.560
This is just straight up veiler

22:34.560 --> 22:36.560
internal communications.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.560
I don't put advertisements on my content,

22:38.560 --> 22:40.560
but I put it on the girls' content

22:40.560 --> 22:42.560
because I want to push them, not me.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.560
This is just straight up comms. I need to shut the f*** up.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.560
I'm, like, literally, uh,

22:46.560 --> 22:48.560
a nightmare. Hold on. I did not

22:48.560 --> 22:50.560
read what this

22:50.560 --> 22:52.560
pack had. Hold on.

22:52.560 --> 22:54.560
Oh no, what's

22:54.560 --> 22:56.560
going with my Wii game?

22:56.560 --> 22:58.560
Have I broken it?

23:00.560 --> 23:02.560
Oh no.

23:02.560 --> 23:04.560
Prevents death of chip scored

23:04.560 --> 23:06.560
are at least 24 of the required.

23:06.560 --> 23:08.560
It's just still...

23:08.560 --> 23:10.560
Oh wow.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.560
What's...

23:12.560 --> 23:14.560
Okay, I think it's having a wee

23:14.560 --> 23:16.560
melty, but that's okay. You're looking to have a melty.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.560
Yo, look, it's

23:18.560 --> 23:20.560
shiny. Just shows her backdoor,

23:20.560 --> 23:22.560
honestly. Tire cards appear four times more

23:22.560 --> 23:24.560
frequently. Okay.

23:24.560 --> 23:26.560
Discover 25 blinds.

23:26.560 --> 23:28.560
Okay. Re-roll boss blinds.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.560
Unlimited times. Okay, okay.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.560
Right, um, I'm actually going to have

23:32.560 --> 23:34.560
to exit this run,

23:34.560 --> 23:36.560
uh, because I didn't pay attention to what

23:36.560 --> 23:38.560
the deck was. Hold on. Let's check...

23:38.560 --> 23:40.560
Let's check out the deck rolls.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.560
New run. At

23:42.560 --> 23:44.560
end of each round, $2

23:44.560 --> 23:46.560
per remaining hand,

23:46.560 --> 23:48.560
$1 per discard, so

23:48.560 --> 23:50.560
no interest. So there's no point in holding

23:50.560 --> 23:52.560
on to economy on the green deck.

23:52.560 --> 23:54.560
Curious.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.560
Initial cards and booster packs are

23:56.560 --> 23:58.560
free. That could definitely

23:58.560 --> 24:00.560
throw us ahead quite

24:00.560 --> 24:02.560
quite

24:02.560 --> 24:04.560
a lot.

24:04.560 --> 24:06.560
That's going to throw us ahead quite a lot, so

24:06.560 --> 24:08.560
I'm going to take it, because we are... was it

24:08.560 --> 24:10.560
10, 9, 8, 7, 6

24:10.560 --> 24:12.560
straight.

24:12.560 --> 24:14.560
Well, if the girl succeeds, you succeed. Yes.

24:14.560 --> 24:16.560
I...

24:16.560 --> 24:18.560
I've kind of touched up on this.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.560
I have done everything I want to

24:20.560 --> 24:22.560
do. Um,

24:22.560 --> 24:24.560
I'm just happy to be back. I'm happy to be

24:24.560 --> 24:26.560
making content, following my goofy ideas.

24:26.560 --> 24:28.560
I mean, like, hell, who the fuck thinks

24:28.560 --> 24:30.560
of pregnancy ASMR?

24:30.560 --> 24:32.560
Um, like,

24:32.560 --> 24:34.560
I just want to do that kind of stuff.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.560
Like, that's where my focus is.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.560
And making, like, funny shorts

24:38.560 --> 24:40.560
and having a good time. Like, that's

24:40.560 --> 24:42.560
where it's... that's what it's

24:42.560 --> 24:44.560
all about. Earn a dollar for each

24:44.560 --> 24:46.560
nine in your full deck. That's so specific.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.560
Right, two booster cards.

24:48.560 --> 24:50.560
What's the dealio? What's the dealio?

24:50.560 --> 24:52.560
A straight...

24:52.560 --> 24:54.560
What?

24:54.560 --> 24:56.560
Four plus multiplier

24:56.560 --> 24:58.560
for each card.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.560
Below?

25:00.560 --> 25:02.560
What does that mean?

25:02.560 --> 25:04.560
So...

25:04.560 --> 25:06.560
So, I can't use that one.

25:06.560 --> 25:08.560
Uh...

25:08.560 --> 25:10.560
If I play a straight... I mean...

25:10.560 --> 25:12.560
You want

25:12.560 --> 25:14.560
to cut cards. It's good for a thin deck.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.560
Yeah, you got a thin deck.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.560
Yeah, you got a thin deck.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.560
Yeah, you got a thin deck.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.560
Yeah, you got a thin deck.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.560
Yeah, that joker is in...

25:24.560 --> 25:26.560
Um, removing cards is actually

25:26.560 --> 25:28.560
good.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.560
I don't have death, though.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.560
I don't know, maybe three

25:34.560 --> 25:36.560
times multiplier for a straight, though.

25:36.560 --> 25:38.560
I think if we could grab

25:38.560 --> 25:40.560
that voucher that has

25:40.560 --> 25:42.560
the...

25:42.560 --> 25:44.560
one, two, skip a few.

25:44.560 --> 25:46.560
I want one, two,

25:46.560 --> 25:48.560
skip a few.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.560
Yeah.

25:50.560 --> 25:52.560
Reminder, there's no point

25:52.560 --> 25:54.560
of holding on to economy. I'm sure

25:54.560 --> 25:56.560
I just... three times multiplier

25:56.560 --> 25:58.560
is insane.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.560
Oh wait, multiplier at the end?

26:00.560 --> 26:02.560
Well, not that the rest even affect it.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.560
Yeah,

26:04.560 --> 26:06.560
simplifying your deck for consistency

26:06.560 --> 26:08.560
is a way for a better run. Me who just

26:08.560 --> 26:10.560
fucking picked that order. Okay,

26:10.560 --> 26:12.560
well, I've done it now.

26:12.560 --> 26:14.560
The pillar, cards played previously

26:14.560 --> 26:16.560
or debuff, that's fine.

26:16.560 --> 26:18.560
Right, a straight.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.560
An ace,

26:20.560 --> 26:22.560
a king, a queen, a jack

26:22.560 --> 26:24.560
and a ten.

26:24.560 --> 26:26.560
Oh my god, what?

26:26.560 --> 26:28.560
That's so weird.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.560
Oh, you just do that then

26:32.560 --> 26:34.560
and throw away the ace.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.560
You're going for

26:36.560 --> 26:38.560
straights during Pride Month?

26:38.560 --> 26:40.560
Damn straight ass.

26:40.560 --> 26:42.560
That's terrible. Don't laugh at that.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.560
That's terrible.

26:44.560 --> 26:46.560
Kings and queens.

26:48.560 --> 26:50.560
Full house, kings and queens.

26:50.560 --> 26:52.560
Okay.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.560
That was a joke, by the way. Relax

26:54.560 --> 26:56.560
snowflake, it's called humor.

26:58.560 --> 27:00.560
Relax.

27:00.560 --> 27:02.560
Okay, the straights aren't going very well.

27:04.560 --> 27:06.560
What do you do?

27:06.560 --> 27:08.560
Bakes?

27:08.560 --> 27:10.560
Right, let's try and get

27:10.560 --> 27:12.560
a few...

27:12.560 --> 27:14.560
Let me get a few high

27:14.560 --> 27:16.560
high straights.

27:16.560 --> 27:18.560
Wait, what's a straight again?

27:18.560 --> 27:20.560
It's when it goes one, two, three, four.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.560
Five. Yeah, because when it's a flush

27:22.560 --> 27:24.560
it's all the same color. Yeah, okay.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.560
I got it, I got it, I got it.

27:26.560 --> 27:28.560
Hi, thank you for joining.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.560
Thank you for anyone for showing up.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.560
I do understand that I stream a bit extreme.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.560
I stream a bit extreme.

27:34.560 --> 27:36.560
I don't know, do we just... how much should we go?

27:36.560 --> 27:38.560
320 blazer.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.560
I mean, we could just get rid of these

27:40.560 --> 27:42.560
and then throw that four away

27:42.560 --> 27:44.560
and see what happens.

27:44.560 --> 27:46.560
I think we're going to make it. Hold on, how much money do we get?

27:48.560 --> 27:50.560
I have made a great

27:50.560 --> 27:52.560
human error.

27:52.560 --> 27:54.560
Oh lord, I have made a great

27:54.560 --> 27:56.560
human error.

27:56.560 --> 27:58.560
What do I need? A queen? I only have

27:58.560 --> 28:00.560
one more queen in the deck.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.560
I have made

28:02.560 --> 28:04.560
a great error.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.560
What do I need? A

28:06.560 --> 28:08.560
10 and a queen.

28:08.560 --> 28:10.560
That's an eight and a six.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.560
Wait, so I need a seven. What are seven?

28:12.560 --> 28:14.560
Okay, the odds of me pulling a seven are so high.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.560
Nine, seven, eight,

28:16.560 --> 28:18.560
six, five.

28:18.560 --> 28:20.560
Discard and pray.

28:20.560 --> 28:22.560
Oh my god, I've completely messed up.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.560
I have to get rid of this.

28:26.560 --> 28:28.560
I'm sorry, I do.

28:28.560 --> 28:30.560
I have to get rid of the high.

28:30.560 --> 28:32.560
I don't have much highs. The odds of

28:32.560 --> 28:34.560
I was going to say the odds of highs are so rubbish.

28:34.560 --> 28:36.560
Okay, 10, nine,

28:36.560 --> 28:38.560
eight, seven, six,

28:38.560 --> 28:40.560
zero.

28:42.560 --> 28:44.560
Okay. That was pure

28:44.560 --> 28:46.560
probability. That was pure probability.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.560
Please, can we get the Joker that does that

28:48.560 --> 28:50.560
thing where it does the thing?

28:50.560 --> 28:52.560
That would be great.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.560
Okay, we are going to...

28:56.560 --> 28:58.560
Oh, that's not bad.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.560
That's not bad. Retriggers all face cards.

29:00.560 --> 29:02.560
So if I happen to get a flush with a face,

29:02.560 --> 29:04.560
a target card and three playing

29:04.560 --> 29:06.560
cards.

29:08.560 --> 29:10.560
Forget, forget.

29:10.560 --> 29:12.560
Something's better than nothing at this stage.

29:12.560 --> 29:14.560
Okay, let's go next.

29:14.560 --> 29:16.560
Oh, a Joker slot.

29:16.560 --> 29:18.560
I'm in.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.560
I'm in.

29:20.560 --> 29:22.560
When they do it like this, it gets so tricky.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.560
And then hope for a king and a tent to come flying

29:28.560 --> 29:30.560
back into my hands.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.560
Surely. Hydration check.

29:32.560 --> 29:34.560
How do we call them?

29:34.560 --> 29:36.560
Surprised you didn't go for the two, three, four and five.

29:36.560 --> 29:38.560
I was feeling quirky. Okay.

29:38.560 --> 29:40.560
It was, I was feeling quirky.

29:40.560 --> 29:42.560
I got a fill house.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.560
Wait, what's the fill...

29:46.560 --> 29:48.560
Oh, you want me to go for fill house?

29:48.560 --> 29:50.560
Fuck it.

29:50.560 --> 29:52.560
Okay, but we're not going to get a flush from doing this.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.560
How much do we get?

29:54.560 --> 29:56.560
Sugar.

29:58.560 --> 30:00.560
King, queen, jack.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.560
So what, ten and nine?

30:02.560 --> 30:04.560
Or seven, six, five.

30:04.560 --> 30:06.560
Oh my gosh.

30:06.560 --> 30:08.560
Just completely re-roll.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.560
I'm going to fail.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.560
I've got three hands.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.560
Wait, I've only made a third.

30:16.560 --> 30:18.560
No, we're going to have to start discarding

30:18.560 --> 30:20.560
for a royal flush.

30:20.560 --> 30:22.560
A royal straight.

30:22.560 --> 30:24.560
Oh, don't do this to me now, game.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.560
Unless I play a double here,

30:32.560 --> 30:34.560
like double jack and double king.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.560
The video lore girls get a little quirky at night.

30:40.560 --> 30:42.560
More like being cheeky and nearly got clapped

30:42.560 --> 30:44.560
for literally the first game in

30:44.560 --> 30:46.560
and absolutely wrecking myself.

30:48.560 --> 30:50.560
Okay, that's exactly what I was hoping for.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.560
Let's go.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.560
A straight. Let's go.

30:54.560 --> 30:56.560
And it gets to play again on the big boys.

30:56.560 --> 30:58.560
Okay.

30:58.560 --> 31:00.560
Looks like I want everything to be royal.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.560
Cloud nine gave us a cheeky four bucks

31:04.560 --> 31:06.560
on top as well, remaining discards.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.560
Yeah? Okay.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.560
Whoa, who are you?

31:10.560 --> 31:12.560
At first hand, a round is a single six.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.560
Destroy it to create a spectral card.

31:14.560 --> 31:16.560
Sure, you're free.

31:16.560 --> 31:18.560
I'll take you.

31:18.560 --> 31:20.560
Right.

31:20.560 --> 31:22.560
We're investing in straights.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.560
Which is...

31:24.560 --> 31:26.560
Ah, not here.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.560
Lucky me. It's not here.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.560
Because why would it be here?

31:30.560 --> 31:32.560
A straight flush?

31:32.560 --> 31:34.560
That's so unlikely. Sorry.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.560
I don't know who ever...

31:36.560 --> 31:38.560
I don't know why you would play for that.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.560
Unless like you maybe got some spectral packs

31:40.560 --> 31:42.560
that like completely...

31:42.560 --> 31:44.560
Uranis?

31:44.560 --> 31:46.560
Fine, I picked Uranis.

31:46.560 --> 31:48.560
I'm not like the other cuttlefish.

31:48.560 --> 31:50.560
I get clapped.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.560
I get clapped for my mistakes in Vulture.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.560
Choose one of up to three turrets.

31:54.560 --> 31:56.560
Hmm...

31:56.560 --> 31:58.560
It's not looking good.

31:58.560 --> 32:00.560
I'm needing something a bit better.

32:00.560 --> 32:02.560
I'm not like other steamers.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.560
I get clapped at the convention

32:04.560 --> 32:06.560
by the replays.

32:06.560 --> 32:08.560
What the fuck? I need to stop.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.560
I need to stop. That was terrible.

32:10.560 --> 32:12.560
Discard to re...

32:12.560 --> 32:14.560
Also me, I wonder why we got uninvited

32:14.560 --> 32:16.560
from that one convention?

32:16.560 --> 32:18.560
Discard to random cards in the played hand.

32:18.560 --> 32:20.560
That's fine.

32:20.560 --> 32:22.560
Oh no, it's not because I'm going for straights.

32:22.560 --> 32:24.560
And a played hand

32:27.520 --> 32:32.240
Queen yep, yep, okay straight show me how you work

32:35.680 --> 32:38.480
Okay, okay, okay, let him get up let him get up

32:39.760 --> 32:44.320
So we just need a ten which we have three remaining odds of ten or high

32:46.800 --> 32:49.680
Which we have three remaining odds of ten or high

32:50.640 --> 32:52.640
Okay, there we go. That's all we needed

32:55.200 --> 32:57.200
I need the card that lets you jump yes

32:57.360 --> 33:03.360
We found it the other day, but we we had already maxed out on pairs should have to all my pairs

33:04.160 --> 33:06.160
um

33:06.720 --> 33:09.280
Earned four bucks or an extra discard

33:12.400 --> 33:14.400
I mean

33:15.600 --> 33:17.600
Four bucks

33:17.600 --> 33:24.960
We'll grab voucher first clearance sale not we uh, I have one space remaining

33:29.760 --> 33:33.760
Got a dip best of luck always risk the big play thank you

33:34.240 --> 33:39.120
I'm wondering if we should get rid of eight ball for an extra discard because if we're going for straights

33:39.120 --> 33:41.120
We need to be able to throw stuff away

33:41.280 --> 33:50.160
I'm sorry if that's the wrong move, but it's my dumb move to make okay. Never gonna upgrade streets

33:52.240 --> 33:55.200
Oh Saturn is a straight Saturn yes

33:56.560 --> 34:02.720
And ring ring uh, you know what fuck it. Let's go for a turret. There's no such thing as interest so oh

34:05.280 --> 34:07.280
We can do Saturn again

34:07.280 --> 34:11.680
Absolutely, absolutely and you come right that worked out very well

34:13.200 --> 34:15.680
Uh next base shop joker is

34:16.400 --> 34:24.480
Polychrome and 1.5 multiplier. That's definitely worth it. I think I think let's find out

34:26.720 --> 34:30.160
Discard is good for finding straights it is i'm

34:30.480 --> 34:32.480
I

34:35.120 --> 34:41.280
Know it's very painful doing it like this, but if we get a high flush this uh, whoever it is. Where are you?

34:43.360 --> 34:46.000
If first hand of round is a single six

34:47.360 --> 34:49.360
Destroy it. No, I don't have a six

34:50.080 --> 34:52.400
um

34:52.400 --> 34:58.800
Yeah, this times three and we just levelled up straight. So we'll go for a royal. I know it looks crazy

34:59.040 --> 35:01.040
I know it looks absolutely

35:02.400 --> 35:06.960
Terrible thrown away, but are you joking me right now?

35:11.840 --> 35:13.840
Are you serious

35:17.200 --> 35:19.200
Are we hello

35:23.440 --> 35:25.440
Hello

35:29.120 --> 35:35.520
This game has nothing but the audacity

35:38.560 --> 35:40.080
Are you kidding me right now?

35:40.080 --> 35:41.600
I literally

35:41.600 --> 35:47.760
Five discards and I couldn't get a high card and the queen still hasn't shown up. I think I might have just thrown that

35:49.840 --> 35:55.520
Because all we needed was a high flush. I threw everything I had five discards for a high flush

35:56.480 --> 36:00.640
Nine eight seven six five. Oh well. We need pray that this is going to do some work

36:01.440 --> 36:03.440
Are you kidding me?

36:03.440 --> 36:08.000
Okay, thank goodness. Are you joking? You could have played the six

36:09.280 --> 36:11.840
Eats. I need to jump. Whoa, who are you?

36:13.120 --> 36:15.120
Okay, I will use you

36:15.360 --> 36:18.880
Um, right. I'm going to keep the extra discard. Uh, I guess

36:19.040 --> 36:27.120
You're in a dollar for each nine and no air and just straight up four bucks. Wait, who?

36:30.320 --> 36:34.800
Oh, these are the exact same right get rid of you and you come. Yeah, you go to the right

36:36.480 --> 36:41.520
You'll do your thing. All right, and then we're doing tariffs. Okay, tarot tarot card

36:42.480 --> 36:44.480
little wild card

36:45.040 --> 36:47.920
multipliers, I think we're gonna have to ask

36:48.880 --> 36:50.880
Let's do this

36:51.200 --> 36:54.560
Here we go. Here we go and you come and you come

36:56.320 --> 36:59.360
The hybrophant the planet

37:01.440 --> 37:05.760
Left to right. Okay, we're gonna take a low and make it a queen now

37:07.440 --> 37:09.440
The left card turns into the right card

37:10.000 --> 37:13.760
We're gonna really try and max up on the high straights

37:14.560 --> 37:16.560
create tarot card

37:16.720 --> 37:20.800
If poker hand contains an ace and a straight

37:24.240 --> 37:26.720
That is ridiculously difficult so

37:27.200 --> 37:32.400
Um, no, I'm gonna keep my economy for now. I know there's no interest

37:32.880 --> 37:36.480
Oh, maybe I shouldn't must play five cards. Don't have to tell me twice

37:38.160 --> 37:41.600
10 9 8 7 6 5

37:42.560 --> 37:44.560
Mmm

37:45.760 --> 37:48.400
It honestly looks like I have a better chance of doing low

37:55.600 --> 37:58.080
Drop play the six

38:00.480 --> 38:03.520
An ace two three four five equals a straight

38:05.440 --> 38:11.040
Oh wait, hold on play the six play the six pause the dunes a first hand of round is a single six destroy it

38:11.600 --> 38:13.200
Destroy it

38:13.200 --> 38:16.560
Destroy it to create a spectral card. Does that mean discard?

38:17.920 --> 38:20.960
If first hand of round is a single six destroy it

38:26.400 --> 38:28.400
Motherfucker

38:29.520 --> 38:32.800
What did that mean destroy it are you from here?

38:37.760 --> 38:39.760
I said destroy it

38:41.840 --> 38:45.360
The first hand not the first discard a folk sick

38:46.240 --> 38:52.240
It's too early in the morning for this. Hold on right king queen. Oh my god. Never get all the royals are coming out

38:54.160 --> 38:56.880
Oh, we need a jack then

38:58.960 --> 39:03.360
We would need a jack to go either way a jack or a ace

39:07.760 --> 39:10.880
I said a jack

39:12.560 --> 39:14.560
Or an ace

39:15.760 --> 39:19.520
Okay, ace king queen jack ten

39:22.800 --> 39:28.640
I don't know why this game doesn't like me. I'm just trying my oh, I've got 14k for that. Okay that popped off

39:29.040 --> 39:35.200
We're gonna be definitely investing in turrets. I'm gonna reroll. What are you rerolls cost two bucks less

39:35.840 --> 39:37.840
You'll never guess what I want you

39:38.560 --> 39:41.360
Iron five bucks for every four discards rank

39:42.160 --> 39:43.280
changes

39:43.280 --> 39:45.280
no

39:45.440 --> 39:49.280
Game if you play astray. I mean that does compliment me

39:55.200 --> 39:58.320
I'll destroy the six so there'll be new sixes. Oh, I get it now

39:59.200 --> 40:01.200
Right turret cartoon

40:02.160 --> 40:04.160
The chariot

40:04.720 --> 40:06.640
Enhances the steel

40:06.640 --> 40:08.640
converts the diamond a wild cat

40:09.680 --> 40:13.280
Uh destroy up to two selected cards. Did we destroy low?

40:14.560 --> 40:16.080
No

40:16.080 --> 40:18.080
maybe

40:18.640 --> 40:20.640
Three three four four four and four

40:22.400 --> 40:28.640
I've got two. Oh, but that's a seven. It's like smack bang in the middle of the deck. It's not even lower numbers

40:29.440 --> 40:35.040
Yeah, they're not they're not low enough spades steel. The best I got is a steel card steel card

40:35.760 --> 40:37.760
How many who's who have I got the most of

40:38.640 --> 40:44.720
A queen's the t-stat clea. I'm gonna oh wait both these queens are already special. Um, it's a wild card

40:44.720 --> 40:46.720
Can't be used in any suit. No

40:47.760 --> 40:50.400
You want the six to spectral you want the six?

40:51.680 --> 40:56.160
It's turned into a steel. Are you on the ace to be a steel? I've got extra uses

40:56.640 --> 40:57.840
I do

40:57.840 --> 41:02.320
Didn't see this is why you guys are better playing this game than me because you guys spot stuff. I never look at

41:03.200 --> 41:06.960
I'm like, oh, oh, I can't see it. What are you talking about recently?

41:07.840 --> 41:11.360
What are you talking about right glass? I don't like glass because I don't want it to break

41:12.080 --> 41:18.960
It increases the rank of two selected cards. I absolutely believe that's probably the best

41:21.200 --> 41:23.200
Thing to utilize so

41:23.680 --> 41:28.400
Oh, let's make a few things higher nine

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Nine and eight let's bring it them up

41:34.080 --> 41:39.760
I know I want things to be closer to a face card, but I don't want to completely negate the 10

41:40.400 --> 41:42.400
Maybe eight and seven

41:43.200 --> 41:45.200
Keep the nine

41:45.600 --> 41:47.840
Eight and seven kind of push the deck higher

41:48.080 --> 41:53.760
We've got two lore here and we want to push the deck upwards so we're more likely to roll higher

41:56.320 --> 42:02.640
I don't know if that logic prevails though, but you know, you can push the four up what just four and

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I guess make a nine

42:06.080 --> 42:08.480
You're right. You're right. Make it higher. Make it higher. Make it higher

42:09.040 --> 42:14.400
Right. No, no make the lures higher that will make it prevail. Okay. I might have made a mistake

42:14.480 --> 42:17.520
But you know what I tried we roll. Wow. What are you?

42:19.120 --> 42:21.440
You're cool, but I don't need you

42:23.840 --> 42:30.400
Uh, we're just gonna buy that to use it because we get multiplier up every time we use uh

42:31.360 --> 42:33.360
Thingy my barber discard

42:34.080 --> 42:36.080
Gives a copy of the next like to tag

42:36.960 --> 42:39.280
Lose the dollar pair around plate. Uh, I hope not

42:40.240 --> 42:45.040
Rude I need an extra hand that would actually really come in clutch. I'm not gonna lie right everyone

42:45.760 --> 42:47.120
Get used

42:47.120 --> 42:49.840
Plot plop plop. Okay currently plus seven

42:52.000 --> 42:54.880
Six solo six solo play

42:57.520 --> 43:03.200
Race creates a random joker, but sets money to zero. Okay. We'll spend everything next round and use that

43:03.760 --> 43:05.760
Mm-hmm

43:06.080 --> 43:13.760
Wait, why did I get an oh got an any any from that? Okay, so what nine eight seven six five? We need a seven

43:15.040 --> 43:17.040
I really don't want to start

43:17.600 --> 43:19.600
Oh my gosh

43:20.320 --> 43:22.320
Our dad just go for high

43:24.000 --> 43:27.200
I'm just gonna go for high because we have a retrigger face

43:27.440 --> 43:35.200
Play and just the six. Yes. Thank you. I'm I really do elevate everyone part

43:38.320 --> 43:40.320
This game loves trolling me

43:42.080 --> 43:44.880
Surely I'll draw a ten surely

43:45.760 --> 43:48.960
Okay, ace king queen jack ten go

43:49.200 --> 43:58.000
Okay, okay, okay. Okay. That was 15. Let's right. How do I use rate?

43:58.400 --> 44:01.760
Sets your money to zero right. We're gonna spend all on purpose

44:03.200 --> 44:05.200
Doubles money buy and use

44:05.760 --> 44:07.760
Up you go. Lovely. Lovely

44:08.560 --> 44:11.760
Cheeky planets, please give me saturn

44:12.640 --> 44:14.640
Level up straight. Yes, please

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Okay, nice nice

44:18.000 --> 44:20.400
Uh, and then three of a kind high card full house

44:22.720 --> 44:24.720
Um

44:24.880 --> 44:30.000
I guess full house doesn't really do anything for me. Um, right. What are you?

44:30.960 --> 44:34.080
Say it's your money to zero, but I can't utilize it. Hmm

44:35.920 --> 44:41.520
I could probably use it now. Oh, I have made a grave error. I'm about to lose 37 dollars

44:42.720 --> 44:44.720
oops

44:44.960 --> 44:50.320
I'm using all my money then buys a car that doubles her money. Uh, I was gonna reroll

44:52.000 --> 44:58.960
Ten wait, what am I doing? Add a negative joker, but take away your hand size. No, I'm already struggling with my hand size

45:02.160 --> 45:07.200
For absolutely no reason your voice activated my phone and it was taken notice. Lovely. Lovely. Monka is

45:08.320 --> 45:13.520
Monka is forget mind controlling you and mind controlling your technology add a gold seal to one slight card

45:13.600 --> 45:15.280
That's probably

45:15.280 --> 45:18.880
You don't have enough room for the joker. Anyway, you need to sell a joker to utilize that. Yeah

45:18.880 --> 45:23.280
I'm not gonna lessen my hand size. I'm already struggling to get like a straight

45:25.040 --> 45:26.560
Um

45:26.560 --> 45:28.560
When plates so I guess you

45:30.480 --> 45:35.600
Okay, and we're gonna reroll I've already had you guys and we're gonna reroll

45:38.480 --> 45:42.560
And now reroll okay you buy and use

45:43.920 --> 45:45.920
Did I just get rid of it?

45:46.720 --> 45:52.560
Did I just sell this uh like I know it's race and like oh race big, but I'm just like oh should bet

45:54.800 --> 45:56.800
Creates a rear joker

45:58.560 --> 46:01.120
One extra discard extra money

46:03.040 --> 46:04.720
Just buy don't use

46:04.720 --> 46:07.520
Either sell a joker or sell race make a choice

46:08.160 --> 46:10.960
So this is complimentary to my high that

46:11.920 --> 46:12.640
A

46:12.640 --> 46:16.320
Spectral card and it's adding a slot. So really

46:17.200 --> 46:23.040
The only guy I can get rid of ah fuck it. We're playing a gamba game. Let's go. Oh wait. No not yet

46:23.520 --> 46:26.560
We need to buy and use. Okay, Uranus use

47:00.160 --> 47:04.400
Times 4.5 is huge is it? Okay. Okay

47:06.400 --> 47:08.400
It all works out in the end for moment

47:09.200 --> 47:14.960
Right, hmm 7 5 4 2 I'm again. I just want to go for highs

47:16.400 --> 47:23.120
I seem to be doing it in one as well for now ace king queen jack 10 if I'm still doing it in one

47:23.280 --> 47:25.280
So you'll see what you do

47:27.120 --> 47:29.120
Whoa

47:29.120 --> 47:31.120
Okay

47:31.680 --> 47:33.680
Okay

47:33.680 --> 47:35.680
Okay, whoa

47:38.640 --> 47:40.640
Wow

47:41.680 --> 47:49.040
Who discard well, I don't need drunkard anymore because no need for drunkard is because I can't skip

47:49.840 --> 47:53.520
No way. Oh come on streamer. Look you cannae tell me

47:55.600 --> 47:59.920
Can skip okay. I need to remember I can skip now because it's gonna mess me up

48:01.760 --> 48:03.760
Oh my god, what was it?

48:04.640 --> 48:07.120
But what happens if you know like what if

48:08.080 --> 48:10.080
What if riefling come on

48:11.600 --> 48:13.600
What if what if

48:13.840 --> 48:16.080
No, you're so stinky

48:18.080 --> 48:21.520
Imagine if it like went the double way add a red seal

48:22.400 --> 48:25.200
Converse all cards in hand to a random single suit

48:26.560 --> 48:31.040
I mean sure add a red seal to one selected card in your hand

48:31.360 --> 48:33.360
I

48:33.840 --> 48:36.960
Red seal let's put it on a king then. I'll keep up

48:38.800 --> 48:44.160
Uh, okay three times multi if a poker is already. Oh, wow. He's actually pretty good as well

48:45.920 --> 48:49.840
But every I am quite happy with everything I've got right now

48:51.680 --> 48:54.320
I mean, I guess the next weakest card we

48:55.200 --> 48:59.520
Have is technically retriggers socks and buskin

49:01.920 --> 49:05.440
But we're not even we're getting 75 000 pair

49:07.920 --> 49:12.480
Red seal the king stick with what you have. Yeah, I shall not shall not be tempted

49:13.200 --> 49:14.400
right

49:14.400 --> 49:18.000
Let's do what we usually do wait. We can jump now

49:21.680 --> 49:23.680
But we can't do it with that

49:24.640 --> 49:26.640
You

49:28.320 --> 49:33.520
Ace king queen right no we can't right there's no point in having that then okay, so ace

49:34.240 --> 49:39.600
King queen jack nine eight. I guess oh, that's so weird

49:45.760 --> 49:49.520
I mean, oh that's mentally very um

49:49.520 --> 49:54.480
Like I can hardly oh, that's perfect

49:55.760 --> 50:00.880
I don't know if poker hand this joker gives a money when a booster pack is skipped. Nah, we're good. Um

50:01.440 --> 50:03.440
I'm gonna grab the voucher. I'm very happy with that

50:05.520 --> 50:08.560
Um, right and then a tarot card. Oh

50:09.280 --> 50:11.280
It's actually a toss up

50:11.600 --> 50:17.520
If I could get a straight upgrade then we can definitely keep up. Oh, that was the wrong choice. I guess

50:17.920 --> 50:19.520
I

50:19.520 --> 50:21.920
That was a wrong choice because we could have got a bit of a

50:23.840 --> 50:28.480
Thing going I'm gonna 25 dollars. Oh, I want to get that though

50:30.160 --> 50:39.360
We'll go for the next right so king jack 10 nine eight seven six five. Oh, that's

50:41.280 --> 50:43.280
That's bizarre

50:44.720 --> 50:46.720
That is bizarre

50:47.600 --> 50:49.600
Oh my gosh

50:51.280 --> 50:53.280
I can't he do that in my head

50:55.200 --> 51:01.840
Uh, right as a stone card. No enhances to the molly cards. Sure. Let's can I use using out? No, I can't well, of course

51:03.360 --> 51:09.840
That wouldn't be fair would it right for the kind to appear through the kind of course again not our freaking problem

51:11.600 --> 51:13.600
Oh

51:13.600 --> 51:16.880
Again, please can we have what I request

51:17.920 --> 51:19.920
uh

51:20.400 --> 51:21.840
High card

51:21.840 --> 51:26.800
Lot are you kidding me? We are having just terrible luck

51:27.680 --> 51:30.720
To get what we want a flush is all the same color

51:32.480 --> 51:36.560
A full house is I mean sure and doesn't make a difference

51:37.200 --> 51:39.600
It doesn't make a difference right next round. Let's go

51:40.240 --> 51:46.160
We're gonna skip because we want the negative joker. What are you play only one hand? Thank goodness

51:47.120 --> 51:50.880
Thank goodness. Okay, so 10. No, right. Let's get rid of the lower

51:52.160 --> 51:54.160
be scaled

51:55.120 --> 51:58.400
Okay, so ace king jack 10 eight

52:00.240 --> 52:05.120
It's be them. It's oh wait. Sorry. Let's also shove you guys into a multi card

52:06.400 --> 52:12.080
So ace king jack 10 eight. Oh god that that's gonna mess it up

52:12.800 --> 52:16.240
Easy peasy lemon squeezy

52:17.040 --> 52:19.040
163

52:19.360 --> 52:23.920
She's too addicted to gamble. I'm not reading chat. Oh, no second joker from the left needs moving to the right

52:24.560 --> 52:26.560
Second joker from the left

52:27.200 --> 52:31.600
It's moving to the right. Why yes, of course

52:33.840 --> 52:35.360
Um

52:35.360 --> 52:37.360
Strony you should I

52:38.240 --> 52:41.520
Ganba time mommy's getting us out of the box. I think we're winning

52:42.640 --> 52:44.640
I don't want to say it, but

52:44.880 --> 52:46.880
three times motley's the poker

52:48.480 --> 52:53.440
So if we mess up one is straight and it doesn't give us enough we get times three that

52:54.560 --> 52:56.160
Holy moly

52:56.160 --> 52:58.160
Holy moly, that's insane

52:59.520 --> 53:03.440
Okay, please for the love of everything just give me

53:03.440 --> 53:05.440
Are you

53:05.600 --> 53:07.600
Oh wait, there is Saturn Saturn there is

53:08.880 --> 53:15.520
The second straight gets hella strong. You literally and unstoppable right. We'll do that. Why not card extra card in shop

53:16.560 --> 53:20.960
The obelisk. I don't like the obelisk any obelisk fans

53:22.080 --> 53:25.360
Hierophant bonus cards left to right

53:26.160 --> 53:28.160
Okay five

53:29.440 --> 53:31.440
Can become a queen

53:34.000 --> 53:37.200
How many queens do I have? No, I have five queens. Okay

53:38.560 --> 53:43.840
I have five sevens. What the heck have I got seven in this deck? No, okay a five can become

53:44.960 --> 53:46.400
a

53:46.400 --> 53:47.920
Jack

53:47.920 --> 53:54.160
No, we can jump so ace jacks. We actually a ten would really be more beneficial

53:54.720 --> 53:57.920
Sealed king double the sealed king got it got it got it

53:59.200 --> 54:01.600
Let's go double the kings

54:02.560 --> 54:06.960
Right, and then we don't have enough through doing anything again. There's no

54:10.800 --> 54:12.800
Wow, okay ace king

54:13.520 --> 54:16.400
Oh, well wait, what why does my hand seem so small?

54:17.440 --> 54:19.440
So what I need a nine

54:22.560 --> 54:28.560
I don't want to throw away. I mean we only need to do it once so I guess we can throw it away

54:29.520 --> 54:34.000
It's not the nicest thing to throw away like all of this, but

54:35.920 --> 54:37.920
We could in theory

54:41.120 --> 54:43.120
Do that

54:43.680 --> 54:49.520
I just need a ten or a nine to be honest. Okay, there we go. Bing bing bing bing bing

54:50.720 --> 54:52.720
Even though I've got the jump

54:53.680 --> 55:00.400
Okay, how much are we getting pair of round played 187. Okay. I think this is a win and round. Sorry

55:01.200 --> 55:06.240
Well, I think this is a win and round. What's the deal here pair? No, no, no

55:07.120 --> 55:09.120
tarot card

55:10.480 --> 55:13.200
The world a gold card

55:14.320 --> 55:17.760
Sure, why not? Oh wait. No, let's make you a gold card

55:19.120 --> 55:21.120
uh and then

55:22.080 --> 55:25.760
I can just straight up skip this devil the three

55:33.120 --> 55:36.960
I can add a ten which will help me do my skip a bit more like

55:37.840 --> 55:39.840
Ace queen ten

55:40.400 --> 55:46.000
And then yeah, I kind of have the ten lets me access lower skips and then just skip all this

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Maybe

55:48.320 --> 55:50.960
Well, this card stays in hand. I mean, no, it seems a shame

55:54.080 --> 56:01.040
I mean, I can do the skip I can do the the street skip thing. It's fine. It's fine

56:05.280 --> 56:07.840
Okay, can queen ten eight six

56:10.560 --> 56:14.560
It's so good though like it's so good hydration check

56:16.960 --> 56:18.960
Oh my god

56:19.760 --> 56:21.760
185

56:22.720 --> 56:24.400
Thousand

56:24.400 --> 56:26.880
Saw is but with one. Oh, we've sold one

56:28.960 --> 56:34.960
Uh, of course it's playing cards. It's not tarot cards because that would be too kind of the game

56:36.160 --> 56:39.120
The eight already popping off literally shows up instantly

56:39.680 --> 56:43.440
The three would have been better gotta hold the gold and steel can't play them for that thing

56:43.520 --> 56:47.040
Oh, I thought oh hold the gold. I thought it was to play the gold one

56:48.160 --> 56:53.040
She is playing the best base deck. Don't jinx the streamer man. No, no, no, we're doing fine

56:53.680 --> 56:56.000
We're doing fine with the I can roll a tarot. No

56:57.840 --> 57:00.960
One and four chance to upgrade poker hands. No

57:02.000 --> 57:04.720
There's nothing that we can really get tempted by

57:05.040 --> 57:10.640
Be at this stage unless it's a negative is the only thing I'm willing to skip for like we're doing good

57:10.960 --> 57:13.520
I want tarot cards. I don't want to be adding

57:15.120 --> 57:20.160
I mean, I guess maybe I can add more high stuff if it's got a high card in it. Okay. Yeah

57:21.280 --> 57:23.280
10 multiplier

57:26.480 --> 57:28.480
Is it high high give me a high number

57:30.400 --> 57:33.920
Nine is much better. Oh, there's an ace though

57:34.880 --> 57:36.880
Okay

57:37.200 --> 57:44.320
Okay, let's go next let's go nice all spade cards are debuffed. Yeah, that's not really a problem. My ace king queen jack ten night

58:03.680 --> 58:06.080
Retriggers all face cards. Okay

Re-rolls cost a little bit less. I'll take that

58:10.160 --> 58:12.160

58:12.480 --> 58:20.720
Please can I have the planet not the other one? Yes saturn? Yes, please. Thank you. What does it look like for saturn?

58:22.160 --> 58:23.520

Okay, yeah, so what do you do creates a planet card if it's still held in my hand

Save our money in case there's something good streamer luck is giving that dope mean literally I feel so much better

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.760
After yesterday's stream

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:20.480
Right, let's turn some stuff into space. Why not? Let's turn a spade into a spade. You know what I'm saying?

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.040
And then a glass card of

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:29.760
I don't like the idea of breaking anything. So I'm putting on a low. I know streamer bad, but I know

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.320
Okay, so

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.320

I know that'll create a pot a planet, but

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.960
I mean we can kind of waste a little bit

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.360
Okay, hold on right ace king queens get

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.680
To 10 to 8

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:18.560
And we get a planet. Okay. That actually worked in our favor somehow streamer luck. Well, I know

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:24.000
I just got here and this stuff is always create literally absolutely crazy right now

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.200
So for those of you who are kindly joining us

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.920
Um, we have retrigger all

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:37.360
Face cards, which means the higher cards and our deck has got like 5 5 6 5 and for the face cards

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
We have a negative

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:46.000
Which is a cheeky spectral if I destroy the six which I've not been using at all. Um

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:52.320
Got the fortune teller so every time I use a turret, but then we have the shortcut on streets

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.640
We have the baseball for on commons, which we have two on common

01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.960
a third on common

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:06.160
Then a multiplier if we do a straight and then a multiplier if the hand's already been done before so it's getting out of hand

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.240
But in a good way

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:13.360
You could just skip the jack and done ace queen 10 8 so

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:23.280
Again, we got Saturn. So we're gonna just straight up level up. I have absolutely no problems. Uh, maybe Saturn again

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.480
It was close

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:33.120
It was between one or the other but it's fine. It's fine. And then again, we're gonna add a high card in

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:35.360
Um

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:43.920
I think 10 is just an assured way to win at this point

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.640
reroll

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.640
devil, yep

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:52.960
Come the Joker gains a mall. I mean, I'm not gonna buy it pair

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:57.440
Conceived hand played without scoring the high cards interesting

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
So you want to oh absolutely

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.080
Absolutely

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.600
Played face cards have a chance to give mere money right what way up against hold on blind

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.280
Nope

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.280
and nope

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:16.480
The fish cards drawn face down

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:24.400
Something tells me we're gonna be okay against the fish. Okay. I don't know. I just have

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:30.400
Uh, three bucks of the heart the card is held. Okay. So what jack 10 98 7

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:34.240
Okay, so we'll just shove the five devil

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:37.200
one two

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.960
three four and five

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:41.920
Yeah, something tells me we're not going to be struggling through this gameplay

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.800
2.5 is still your highest combo though

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:47.440
Yeah, I was a little lipped with it

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.120
We get so much money as well

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:58.720
Two bucks for four hands remaining two bucks for four discards at four bucks. Sorry money and stuff one consumable slot and you come

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.920
and you come

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.920
um

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:06.480
Sure

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:10.560
Free money. Thank you and we get a little level up on that

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:16.000
Again with the playing cards. It really does not want to give me tarot cards. Does it?

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.560
Give me the king give me has

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.520
We'll just pick the

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:25.680
That's fine. We're just literally we're gonna max out on high

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:31.120
What do you do earn four dollars if the poker hand has a straight?

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:38.800
Yeah, you can you get negative poker cards in the shop or is the rarity of it insane because I don't think I've ever

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:40.960
done it

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:45.440
Rerolls the blind forces one card to always be selected

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.960
I mean

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.760
With our skip is that really that bad?

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:59.120
All right, I'll buy you so we can use you four of the canes

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.400
Free money

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.400
It won't always be a straight

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:11.440
Chances non zero. There's a voucher. You can get random negatives, but it's so rare

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.920
I'd be oh wait, I can't okay use please. Thank you

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.920
Yeah

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.560
Uh sure by that and we'll use that

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:28.320
Uh the point in rerolling at the moment because our hand is full and we need access to our deck

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.920
Oh, yes

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.560
Okay, so strength maker to

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.840
Uh 10 I guess

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.640
We've got seven coins

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.960
An ace. Oh, you know what make it an ace. Why not boom boom boom boom

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:48.880
What

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.200
Wait

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.520
What did I

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:55.520
Huh, what did I just do?

01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:59.520
That was oh

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:08.720
Okay, it's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's fine seven six five three two

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.960
brav

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:16.800
Brav I wasn't reading strength. We'll just lost an ace. I'm sorry

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.760
I got confuzzled. Okay. I thought it was the thing

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.200
Like the oh

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:31.680
Yes for how many steel interesting. I don't have I don't have it, but it's fine

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:39.040
Oh, we just need a few more saturns to make up for that. That was my bad. That was my it's fine. She's winning too hard

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:42.560
I don't need to think exactly. I don't need to think we're just

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:46.240
Steam rolling up. I guess I mean, I guess

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.680
Though I really want a six. Oh, there's only two

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.640
Do I really want

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:01.040
No, I don't I'm oh wait. I could have used that gray card. Oh

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:08.400
Well, I did it now. All right, let's see if we can get a cheeky negative because why not

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:17.360
One discard each round. Come on. Give us a negative. You know, you want to re-rolls boss blind and initial card

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.600
Nah, give us a

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.680
Yeah thingy or give us a tarot

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:24.080
Jeez

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.080
Are you serious?

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.360
Got the shop hates me

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.120
Oh, okay, there we go

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.200
One more

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:42.400
Increases rank of the two so like oh for goodness sake. Yes, and you come

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:48.080
Silly, okay increases rank

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.600
Repeat after me increases

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.360
rank

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:57.760
So what the five and the three to push them up the board

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.040
Increases rank you

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.360
Silly sausage you

Such a silly sausage, right

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:09.360
Uh jar, uh nine

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:17.360
Nine eight seven six four. Yeah easy piece of lemon squeezes

Then sure let's call upon okay, there's not any other variation that we really want so fine

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:52.240
It's fine and then two tarot cards, which will absolutely take um

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:58.880
I know I shouldn't but I can't help it. I love the gambas. No

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:04.960
Okay, and then no glass card multi-card

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:10.720
Bonus cards increase the rank maybe

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.920
Uh

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:20.000
We'll do molly cards. Why not? Let's make that jack and ace worth some

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.120
worth simsing

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:27.040
The true halo. Oh my god. Is that halo? Is that master chief from the hit game?

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
A fortnight. I'm sorry

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:34.400
That why you're so cool looking. Oh, that's messing up my eyes

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:38.480
Thank you very much for coming to member. I appreciate the

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:41.280
direct support

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.320
Retriggers all cards. No

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.800
Yeah, let's go

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:52.240
Right, why are you forcing me to play a king a queen a jack a ten?

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.440
No, that's up here. Shout out to all my players right so

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.880
Back and still throw away for

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.680
I know it. I know it seems crazy

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.800
Wait

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.240
That changes every hand

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.440
That's so dangerous

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:24.320
Oh because it's selected it would get thrown away dafty

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:30.640
Oh, we won on the deck. We did it first freaking try good thing. I didn't bet against you damn straight

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.680
Little thing you

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:38.800
I am so dumb. Of course. It would throw away the selected card. I was like, I'm going to play around this

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.280
We are very lucky. We actually

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:45.360
Did that whole ole money. All right. I'm not going to do endless modes

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.480
Have at least two polychrome jokers

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:53.040
Two plus multi for every five dollars you have

01:11:54.480 --> 01:12:00.000
Okay, curious little hydration check start run with no face cards and you're

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:04.880
No face cards

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:10.880
Right, we've got a seal for red blue yellow green. We don't

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.960
One plus joker slot, but one less hand

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.600
Hmm one less hand so three hands total

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.640
Hmm curious

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:35.600
I've already forgotten what one less hand but one more joker slot. Okay. Well, we've got six five

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:38.400
We've got dupla vase

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:48.880
I mean we'll play the doubles two pair. Why not? Well, that really wasn't that much points if I'm going to be honest

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.280
Uh, I thought that was going to be a little bit more

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.800
Uh, we do have a suit in the distance

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:00.160
I might regret this but

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.320
Okay, we got the suit

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.400
We got the flush. Yeah

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:11.920
Okay, there we go. We made it. We made it. It's fine. It's fine. Right. We're back to normal economy. So

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.800
Not the game already pushing us to try and

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:22.000
Um do two pairs. No, we don't have anything that shapes the deck. Yeah

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:27.360
Our economy's rubbish, are we gonna win the

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.000
If I fail the hook discard two random cards each time please

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.600
I actually think we need to invest, you know that

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.280
Wait the hiker. Yeah, okay, okay

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:45.760
Uh, sure and we'll level up two pair because I'm a little bit nervous about this last one

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:48.560
Oh wait

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:56.560
I didn't realize we were or we weren't at the boss fight yet. Hold on. I shouldn't have done that but we did it anyway, so

01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:03.600
Let's do ranks. We already have two doubles and we did just level up pairs. So shout out to all my pairs

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.880
We're gonna throw away that five so it's no longer in our inventory

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:12.320
Um, and then we are going to repeat and do the exact same thing

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:15.760
Two doubles throw away the five and there

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:21.280
We almost had it. Sorry my impression was again two doubles

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.840
And so just throw away one

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:26.800
Uh

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.800
There we go

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.160
I wouldn't say easy that was our last hand

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.800
A bit of a rough start I have to admit

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.720
I mean we can use a tarot

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:49.200
Or we could do three of a kind. Um

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:52.640
Early hiker is pretty good

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.760
We don't have anything that shapes us

01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:02.560
I kind of want to get economy going. Fuck it. We need we need a gamble. We need gamble. I need economy

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:07.280
discard two random cards pair hand played well

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:14.480
Well, let's do that and see oh, of course the ace goes flying into space. Um

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:19.280
We're getting incredibly lucky with the

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:28.640
The cards though. I think if you go for flushes straight house, you'll win this boss fight. Hmm. Okay. We'll one it thankfully but

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:34.960
I need to retrain my brain because it wants to oh my god

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.760
Did you hear my stomach?

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:43.120
That's not gonna be enough is it no it doesn't look like that

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:49.840
I mean it would be kind of oh no, we only have one hand left whole holy moley. I was about to throw there

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:54.560
Um

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.120
Okay, get rid of these

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:04.160
Okay, that's fine. That's fine. We're safe. We're safe. Relax

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.920
No flake. It's called being bad at about true

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:12.880
Okay, that's fine. We didn't get any interest but we will next round

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.920
so

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:22.720
That's just awful by all the kids. Oh, did we do it?

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:30.560
We could shape our deck right now. What's the what the beans can I get a base?

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:34.800
Next base addition Joker is free and a foil

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:39.520
Hmm

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.960
Minus one hand size. Hmm. I do not have much faith for this

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:49.920
I think we're gonna have to shape the deck right now

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:54.480
Earn five bucks for each discarded ace

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:59.520
A first discard of round has only one card

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.240
Oh for goodness sake

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.600
That's not shaping the deck at all

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:08.320
for you

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:12.320
First played face cards give times to it

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.320
Please don't help me

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:20.720
Earn an extra dollar of interest for every five bucks you have at the end of the round

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:28.480
Right, I don't think we're gonna win and for that reason alone. I'm going to discover that card

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:34.320
I know it's going to be frustrating being like you're literally thrown because you're not

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:38.320
I think we're already to pass the point of winning

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.920
We'll do a free Joker in the next shop, but

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:48.240
I for each earned five bucks for discarding an ace

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:51.920
Five four three two nothing

01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:00.000
The black deck is the hardest to play. Yeah, and I'm needing something to

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.680
Yeah

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.400
I

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:20.240
Right what I need a 10 under queen

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:25.760
Close but no cigar a 10

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:30.160
Okay

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.640
10

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:35.600
Okay, well

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:39.200
Well

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:43.440
That's why I bought that because I didn't think we'd be lucky and yeah, no no got it

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:50.800
Literally what can I do a true purple that's a three of a kind

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:59.280
Can't do nothing else, right? Okay. Let's try that again. Let's try that again. We unfortunately didn't get anything that was kind of complimentary

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:04.000
So again one post joker slot, but minus a tiki hand

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.840
That was rough right. What are you uncommon Joker?

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.080
I

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:16.400
Skip that for the rare because you can't do two in a row for some reason

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:20.240
Let's go for double vase

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:24.880
Shoot easy easy to win off the bat for these ones. Um

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
10 98

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Gonna work um

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.040
Gee imagine if you gave me

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:38.960
Oh, wait, you know what? Let's just play the doubles and get rid of that

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:46.400
God this this game does not like me

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:54.880
Wait, okay, we'll just do a full house. That's fine. That's fine. It's fine. We can do a full house. See it's fine relax

01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:00.000
Okay, what are we looking at? What are we looking at?

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
And

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:05.520
Well, we can't buy anything

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.720
I think we're gonna have to just go in

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:17.200
And try and do something like that could be better. I'm gonna be honest that could be better

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:23.840
I think we'll invest in

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:26.800
Oh

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.160
Why are these so sucky and not the good kind?

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:33.120
Okay, we're gonna skip the rare

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:40.240
Sorry, we're gonna skip the blind in order to do get a free Joker because we need jokers to instantly

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:44.240
Shoot maybe

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:53.200
We need jokers to help us out played cards with spades to give plus three wins scored spade

01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:57.600
I don't even have one spade on hand. So that's not happening

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.880
Unless I'm just throwing everything in the bin

01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:14.240
I mean, I could sorry the smart stomach internally farting if I came up in my um, I could go for a flush on

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:17.440
heart

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:22.320
This is my first stream. Wow. Hello. Thank you for the tip. I appreciate it

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:29.200
Your first stream and it's me being rubbish on freaking Baltral shaking my head my head

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:35.440
Or did you come in right at the start where I showed the pregnancy artwork? Hmm. Hmm

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:38.160
Be honest. So when was it?

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.040
I don't know what to do

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:44.240
I could go for a flush with hearts

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:50.800
Okay, that actually kind of worked out somehow

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:56.880
And that got me 200 for that play which is all I need

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.320
This is

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:12.820
Not good not not good at all. I think I might have to discard for a flush of spades

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:25.280
Oh

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:31.680
My god

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:38.000
I think we're better going for diamonds. Oh, no, they've only got six diamonds

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:43.120
So the odds of pulling us. Okay. Sorry. I'm so sorry. This is gonna look painful, but

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:46.720
Yeah, okay, that's what I wanted

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.280
Okay

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:04.560
That paid off somehow that paid off and we get a free joker out of the shop. What is it?

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:07.680
I'm

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:10.320
I don't have anything

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:12.960
Oh, this is cursed

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:16.800
This is cursed so much

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.880
I

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:22.880
Have nothing shaping this again

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:30.800
Add one voucher three hand size base chips and mullies or have

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.800
Brothers is too hard

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:37.920
And not the good game

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.360
I have nothing

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.600
Oh

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:49.280
There's no point in spending any money I have no direction

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:53.200
I have no direction in my game

01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:54.480
There's

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:58.400
Oh, I don't I don't believe maybe we'll try a different pack next round

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:02.640
Because uh, I do not think we've got this

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:07.520
What's this ace ken queen jack right so give me a ten

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:10.480
So go

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:14.960
Give me a ten

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:19.760
You know your funny game, I don't like you

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:30.400
I don't think we've won this I think we'll try a different deck because holy moly is this deck freaking hard like not the good kind

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:38.640
Why we we might just have to fucking put everything into space honestly

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.600
Doubles I mean

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.280
Should we just

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.400
Right I've never used this before the credit card, but

01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:06.880
I think we're just gonna have to go all in or else like we just straight up can't win

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:14.960
To convert the left death select two cards converts the left into the right. So this is the one we do want

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.160
So take the two make it a queen

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:24.640
Oh, but then there's what I don't even want to use the wheel of fortune ain't gonna get scone for me

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:28.160
We're just gonna go in today. I'm sorry

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.120
Hi, thank you for joining

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.680
um

01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:35.680
Hearts not

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:44.000
The only thing is spades. We're even interested in multi cards. Yeah, we're just use mullies on the highs

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:47.040
This is rough

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:51.680
We can go into debt but over a card slot. I don't think so

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.160
I don't think so base chips

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:06.640
I don't know if I'm making any of the right decisions, but this is like this is terrible

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:08.960
Oh

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:16.080
Absolutely terrible. No, what are you uncommon? Okay, so that's good

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:20.480
98

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:24.960
987 no, we can't do nothing there. All right, let's get rid of the wee ones

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:30.480
I know we need a 10 and and obviously it's not gonna give me one

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:40.720
We got a McMansion only to lose it in the next round literally that game was so good clubs flush. Oh

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:47.200
Okay, you are absolutely correct. How did you even see that?

01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:50.400
Play

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:54.480
Oh wait, is this spades? Oh, it's spades. Oops. It's the other one I need

01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:59.120
Are you kidding me

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.560
This

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:11.680
Game is such a troll one minute. It's like, yeah, don't worry. I got you

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:15.680
I'll get you addicted real quick baby cakes and then the next minute. It's like now you're on your own

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:19.120
The whip flash I get from playing this game

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:24.960
Okay, that this guy is saving us right now

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:27.360
I

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:33.040
Would absolutely adore an extra hand size. Thank you

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:36.160
Okay, a minus four. That's fine

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:40.160
One discard each round two plus hand size

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:44.160
But an uh hand size down

01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:50.720
I need something anything to shape this run

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.280
No

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:59.760
Spades and clubs are confusing. I'm too small brain honestly get the plus two joker

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:04.240
Like

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:07.040
Like I might as well just go all out

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:13.920
I'm gonna pop. Why is this game so hard this game would I'm just I'm going full debt

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:21.840
Mummies losing the house mum mummies failing her mortgage payments. That's it. I owe so much ASMR right now

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:33.360
Wa wa wa diamonds hearts clubs spades wait, what what we're picking

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:39.200
Two times multi two and four chance to get destroyed though

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:43.760
I feel like you're just gonna get destroyed instantly 50 chance of it popping away

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:52.320
Card can be used in any suit. I feel like maybe just I feel like we have to go spades. I know it sounds silly, but

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:59.120
I don't want to be homeless. I mean, are you technically homeless if you can

01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.680
That's it. Are you technically

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:06.240
Oh

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:12.400
Next base edition shop joker is a free and holographic. Well, we're gonna have to go for it

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:16.160
Not that one though

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:19.200
Um

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:24.160
You can't be homeless if you can technically

01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:32.560
Get inside somewhere and have a home there wink wink right discard all that

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:36.080
Okay, I gave me a space

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:42.640
This is the this I think we're gonna have to go suits

01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:47.920
A flush sorry my pardon me. I think we're gonna have to go with flush

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:55.120
What are you you're free for each joker card? Absolutely. What take out take away a discard I guess

01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:58.320
Yeah, and then in you come

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:02.400
And then

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:07.840
Yep, I will go into debt for spades because we want all the spades

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:12.080
And then I can't go into any further debt. That's fine

01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:15.520
Okay

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.840
Spades or play only

01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:22.640
Oh, well, it's over now in that suits spades and then

01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:26.400
Do the rank and then turn all you guys into spades

01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:35.440
Okay, and then do a suit again and then ace did it since we can only play one round. Good luck

01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:46.640
Okay, well we have her we have our bearings

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:50.560
Which is we want things to be a

01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:54.640
Flush

01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:04.400
And do we upgrade flush via celestial hat flush flush flush flush flush dripper

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.800
We are in so much debt

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:16.080
Choose two four jokers

01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:18.640
Would it all spade cut?

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.360
Yeah

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:24.320
Are you serious?

01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:26.640
Are you serious?

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:32.080
All spade cards are debuff. Meanwhile, this is the only thing keeping us alive right now

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:34.960
The curse of the credit card

01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:39.440
Shawnee owns the debt collectors. Oh gee. Honestly

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:45.440
Now sell the credit card I lose the game if I sell it

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:48.960
Because I'm like in so much debt

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:54.880
That's how they get you this we are literally learning an economy 101 right now

01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:57.680
This is how they get you

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:01.440
Should I do the buffoon

01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:04.720
You know what wait? No, you're on common, but you're common

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:08.240
So maybe I can pick up an uncommon and then he can come in to play

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:12.240
I'll put you to the end

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:17.440
You know what let's let's get silly with it

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:20.880
Let's get silly with uh, there's only one uncommon

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:24.800
Uh, well this was

01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:27.520
Absolutely useless right if I sell you

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:30.240
Then add you

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:32.560
Because you're on common so you're gonna compliment him

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:37.920
Gain chips if the hand contains a straight right. We need a bigger hand size

01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:42.000
Oops all sixes doubles all listed probabilities. I don't

01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:49.840
Know

01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:54.720
We what

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:01.280
Wait, did I kill us with debt?

01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:10.240
Oh my god, wait, I don't have my glasses on that that's definitely a minus sign

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:16.160
Uh, my bad. I'm a I'm gonna just sell that

01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:18.720
Uh

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:24.960
Yeah, let me let me just sell that my bad. Uh, wasn't who wasn't my intended purpose

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:28.720
Uh, we'll just do the straight then eat

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:32.080
I didn't even know the game worked like that

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:39.440
Well, I think we're gonna have to skip as well because our freaking only card is deep off

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:46.960
How much does one regular flush get us

01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:53.840
Wow

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.400
We may make it

01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:02.960
We may make it in in the end

01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:08.960
I

01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:10.960
So what happens now?

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.920
Okay

01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:25.360
The one thing we put right new run we need a different card. That's so hard

01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:30.400
That's so hard

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:35.680
Mommy, there's only so much debt a reef Lincoln handle. Literally. Sorry. I completely screwed that run over

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:41.280
Uh, I was getting a bit confused. Okay. I was getting confuzzled. Am I not allowed to be confuzzled?

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:43.680
Rude honestly

01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:44.880
Right

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:48.800
Spatial cards may appear in the shop start with a hex

01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.360
Is that even bad

01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:04.320
Destroy all their jokers

01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:08.640
Okay

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:10.880
But we don't even

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:13.360
Wait, so if we have two jokers, I'd pull

01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:20.720
If we have two jokers 50% one is destroyed 50% the other is

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:24.160
Receives a buff, okay

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:34.160
The run went from mummy please to mother the debt literally absolutely twat that

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:39.360
Uh, just go for double base and we're there

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:42.800
Okay

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:46.000
Can't believe it. I'm actually gonna have to play the economy in this game. Uh

01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:55.040
You need but really they go for a bit fun pack and try and shape it off the bat

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:02.640
Against my better judgment adds the number of poker

01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:06.560
Times the poker hand has been played this run to the molly

01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:10.960
This joker gains

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.440
multiplier for each card sold

01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:16.640
Resets when the boss is no that's rubbish

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:19.520
Sure come aboard you

01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:27.360
And then do that and then it's a 50 50 right, okay, we now have a 1.5

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:36.560
As the number of times the poker hand has been played this run to the multiplier, okay, so we just keep going

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:45.680
I don't think I'm understanding this properly um

01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:48.960
We do have a duple of aim

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.600
I do we just get rid of all the low

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:56.320
Now the more you play the same hand the stronger it gets

01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:59.360
Oh, no

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:02.080
Well, there's another full house. Why not?

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:09.760
So I want to do full house now

01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:14.720
Uh tarot another joker

01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:23.600
Hopefully we can get a negative joker the next all spade cards are debuff. That's fine. Um

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:30.240
Mummy disassociating in the club playing purely off of vibes. Honestly. I'm getting lost in this loss

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:34.240
Right, that's fine. Clubs are debuffed. That's fine

01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:42.960
Right if they're debuffed, I don't even want them in my hand to be honest

01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:48.240
I'm sure I'm probably making like some should I just go for a flush

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:52.800
Clearly not

01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:56.080
What's this then? I have a duple of e

01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:00.160
To appears how much is that gonna get me

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:07.840
No, oh, yeah, that's not even that bad. I don't know how you work, but you're honestly helping. Um

01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:15.680
Ten nine eight seven six. I got rid of roots of sixes

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:21.920
Oh wait idiot jack ten nine eight seven

01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:28.720
He he he sorry. Sorry. I raised your blood pressure. They're almost hitting send. I'm sorry. I know what did

01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:33.280
I almost did it. Okay. We've got one dollar interest. That's what I like to see

01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:36.400
Raises the cap on interest

01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:41.200
I wouldn't mind that

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:46.800
Initial booster packs are free and I can pick two joe. I might do double skip. You know that

01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:49.760
No, I can't

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:52.720
Hmm

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:59.280
What is it booster packs are free initial cards and booster packs? Okay, that might be worth it

01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:02.960
Oh, my mouse is uh, please don't die mid game. That would be great. Mr. Mouse

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:07.600
I think we're gonna go and get more money

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Uh, we'll do that

01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:19.840
I know I should probably invest in two pairs something but

01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:24.080
I didn't trust it right. We're gonna get free stuff from the shop and then we're gonna play

01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:28.240
Oh

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:30.240
A cheeky double. Is that the best I got?

01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:33.520
What does one hand do?

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:37.840
A full house, please work

01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:45.360
Okay, that was lucky right what is free in the shop, please help us

01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:48.240
Please I beg

01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:53.760
Well, it's free. So go for it. Wait bye. Oh, I mean, I guess bye

01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:00.000
We does the card or a planet card

01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:02.480
So

01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:11.600
I don't even oh this run isn't

01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:14.720
See when you cannae

01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:17.440
When you cannae shape the run right at the start

01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:22.240
It becomes like a shot in the dark it really does

01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:29.840
I think maybe three of a kind I seem to be or maybe two pairs. They see the most common

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:36.720
Well, you can just you just gotta start picking but that's pressure and stuff

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.600
Right must play five cards. That's fine

01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:45.840
Uh, right, we just did get doubles. So let's do that play hand

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:48.960
Is that yet? No

01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:54.640
Okay, that's not that bad. That's not that bad really. It's we're doing fine for now. We're doing fine

01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:59.920
I need to well destroy lower number cards. Yeah

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:03.840
We got nine our economy's getting there

01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:08.960
That's pretty good have to admit

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:15.920
These however are the worst why can't I use it?

01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:21.200
Do you need to have a second joker to use it the egg

01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:24.720
Gains three bucks of sell value at end of round

01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:33.200
What it just keeps going up and up and up or is there like a ceiling

01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:41.440
Is this like playing the stonks market invest in stonks now and then later it's better

01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:46.880
It goes up. Okay. I'll get I've never I've not grabbed it before so I'm glad I can unlock it

01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:50.240
It right

01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:57.040
Fuck it. No, wait. No, no, wait. No, I should hold on to it

01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:04.640
Oh, no, wait, never I should hold on to it because it's a plus 10

01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:16.320
Only I would manage that. What do you do spectrum? No, keep your eyes from both of them

01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:20.560
But now it does something till you need to sell it

01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:27.040
We can get better with the cash later. Honestly, how can I be messing this up so much, right?

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:31.200
Would it create the planet if there if it's held in the hand? That's fine

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:35.600
Oh, wait, I need to delete the smaller cards

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:42.720
I don't know

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:47.200
I just destroy the two

01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:50.800
Which wasn't very nice, but I did what I had to do

01:42:53.520 --> 01:43:01.200
You discard those okay, we can do a flush again a full house my apologies a full push

01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:06.240
Well, there it is

01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:09.200
I guess we're going for it with him

01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:13.040
With a full house, which I don't normally go for but he will

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:15.760
Uh diamond cards

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:19.600
We might be doing it as if I can even get

01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:24.720
Three three times multiplier if you have 16 enhanced card currently nothing

01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:29.520
Yeah, no, uh, I'm not gonna be shocked that I I'm not going for that because jase

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:40.320
Plus three multiplier on a diamond how much do you sell for a whole six dollar beautiful stuff, right?

01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:42.320
What are we looking at?

01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:45.040
Rubbage, right just keep sending it

01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:47.920
I think we're gonna have to go full house

01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:52.080
Runs if we can even do it because we can't on the first one

01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:55.440
And get rid of that play hand

01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:58.080
How much?

01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:03.440
We're making it by the skin of our teeth for now

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:08.880
For now we can do it

01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:14.160
You leveled up again. Oh, he's nine dollars

01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:27.920
Ah this nothing is being shaped right now nothing at all

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:35.680
I'm just going for it and our freaking egg is mocking us saying. Oh you want to sell me don't you?

01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:42.640
Multi needs to be before

01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:46.960
You go here

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:54.240
The daily card get me 2.5 million feels good man

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:02.160
Okay, supernova's at the end. Thank you one day. I'll remember fancy-looking cards to the right

01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:05.120
Is to do that day? No, no it is not

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:07.840
um

01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:11.200
And then is this the boss by one minus hand size

01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:14.160
We're actually doing

01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:19.440
Okay in quotation marks. So I I'm confident we at least have this round

01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:28.560
Oh, it meant handers and cards in my deck. Uh, we might have to go for a suit

01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:40.640
Oh

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:47.680
Thank goodness, thank goodness

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Okay

01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:03.520
I'd really rather like to keep that to have a hidden upgrade

01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:05.760
Uh

01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:11.280
But playing this is gonna do like next to nothing

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:21.680
If you draw 10 it's a straight flush

01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:29.200
Wait, I have three hands. Hold on. I have two more. Sorry. That's for something again. Right. That's fine

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:35.520
I

01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:40.400
Need a 10

01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:52.240
I needed a 10 either way right what do two kings do I really want to keep this

01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:57.360
Okay, okay

01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:04.320
I literally I just I want to level up anything because I'm I'm scrambling right now trying to save this run

01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:10.480
Ouija minus hand size. Absolutely not. I'm have I'm perishing

01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:14.400
Converts all cards into a straight wait. I'm not doing

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
No, I need diamonds apparently

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:25.280
Bruh, this this is the worst run. I think we've ever had there's like no point in spending any money

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Oh

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:30.320
You believe

01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:37.440
I'm perishing

01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:44.320
I'm perishing I've got a rank possibly

01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:46.320
Okay

01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:56.160
Oh my god my stomach's making me feel crazy. Bruh

01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:02.320
Honestly, I did it. Streamer luck has to kick in at some point. I think I used it on the first run

01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:06.160
This is like awful

01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:08.960
Oh

01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:17.360
Literally the the egg that is taunting us is keeping us alive. Oh my god. It's ready to help as well

01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:20.800
Which I really don't want but hey, I mean we'll get a

01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:24.720
A thing so

01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:29.040
You know, I'll take you anything that levels up anything. I'll take it

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:32.720
Yep

01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:34.720
I

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:39.840
Literally level up anything I am scrambling I'm scrambling

01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:44.400
Sure, let's just keep leveling up to a pair

01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:47.440
Scramble any harder

01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:49.920
Call me eggs because I'm scrambling for anything, right?

01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:54.720
Sure, we've got room for another Joker. Let's see if we can shape with four

01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:57.280
awful

01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:59.280
awful

01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:06.720
Oh, I guess you

01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:18.480
The egg is keeping us alive. I can't even get rid of the purr guy

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:23.200
Diamonds are helping loyalty card is helping

01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:27.200
Poker splash

01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:30.160
You had a straight but you tossed it

01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:37.440
I don't think I've had enough sleep. I slept all day after stream yesterday and I still don't think I had enough sleep

01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:45.920
Airing an extra dollar of interest I wish I could sell

01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:55.040
This is gonna come in clutch whenever we're absolutely panicking I don't think I'm gonna have to skip these are rubbish

01:49:57.920 --> 01:49:59.920
I

01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:04.480
I'm not gonna make it not gonna make it

01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:09.120
I do not believe

01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:17.840
I do not believe I haven't slept a single segment straight into work after stream. I'll let you zombie

01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:23.280
I had enough sleep, but it wasn't enough. Are you me? I am

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Um

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:28.400
How do you guys see that so easily?

01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:33.200
I'm destroyed from all the crying. I am I'm actually distraught

01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:36.560
I

01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:40.000
For anyone who didn't see yesterday's stream

01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:44.080
I've got John Wick spoilers if you don't want to listen for like the next three minutes

01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:47.440
If you just want to close your ear. Oh my god. I can't even open up my bottle of water

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:54.320
Oh, oh, did you hear my wrist crack trying to open this bottle of water? Geez, what did they make the freaking cap out of titanium steel?

01:50:57.920 --> 01:50:59.920
Outrageous, um

01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:02.400
Did you hear it?

01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:08.480
Ew, that's so gross. My wrists are really I have it incredibly. I thought that was the bottle cap

01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:09.920
Fine

01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:16.320
Um, I have really weak wrists and hands for some reason like all my strength is in my thighs and my

01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:21.280
My gluteus maximus. That's where all the strength in my body lies. I have no other strength

01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:25.440
I have no strength in my back. I have no strength in my hands my arms my wrists anything like that

01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:33.360
Um, it's just all all even my even my toes are stronger because I can grip things with it

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.800
Like I have absolutely nothing else going for me

01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:39.920
Um

01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:41.920
Right jack 10 987

01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:47.920
Wait, we only got 1.8. When do you pot? Oh, you don't pot

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Oh no

01:51:55.680 --> 01:51:59.600
Oh no, right, we've got a full house which is leveled up

01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:06.640
We're gonna be okay. I think oh no, we did it. We did it

01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:14.320
How much are you $18 or beloved egg is $18 now three of a kind

01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:27.360
I don't have anything strong it opens jars with their thighs. Oh, no, you have to tap it on the bunker

01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:32.240
um, if you tap the jar lid on the bunker it like

01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:35.440
Weakens it and then you can open up

01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:37.840
um

01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:44.720
Crumbling to dust before our eyes not quite not quite but like literally I can't handle it

01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:48.800
Oh, wait, sorry a countertop. It's bunker in scotland

01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:53.920
But uh the kitchen countertop is what you call it smile

01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:57.120
We call it a bunker. I I know I know

01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:01.440
Why why Scottish people? Why do you call it a bunker? I don't know

01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:08.960
It's just how it is. It's called a bunker the the kitchen countertop the worktop the whatever the bench the kitchen bench

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:11.040
maybe you call it

01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:13.120
I want to pass on by strong his thighs

01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:18.880
50 that convention. I'll make all my travels expenses back. I'll have a little sign

01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:21.360
50 cents to be stepped on

01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:25.840
A dollar to be a thigh crushed until you pass it. That's terrible

01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:30.800
I mean, honestly, it would be a way to get your money back, right? I am fully

01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:33.520
I have fully accepted this run isn't happening

01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:46.080
I'm gonna start beatboxing to cool

01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:54.880
Oh my god, you can squeeze the lid with the palm of your hand. I don't have any grip strength either

01:53:57.520 --> 01:53:59.520
Could you could you imagine

01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:05.840
Imagine no grip strength. You know when people always make fun of folk for having a weak handshake

01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:08.960
Imagine the weaker grip

01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:15.520
I mean I could I could probably grip it like a vice if I wanted to but my like it hurts

01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:21.680
It hurts everything although my gran had absolutely terrible arthritis in her hands

01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:26.080
And unfortunately, I'm gonna teach you a fun fact about biology

01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:28.880
If you are a chick

01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:39.280
Wait, whatever your dad's gran has in ailments, you are almost like 100 likely to get it

01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:42.560
However, your mom's gran

01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:47.360
ailments aren't necessarily always going to be passed on to you

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:53.120
But if it's your dad's mom or your dad your gran on your dad's side

01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:56.800
Then you're very likely to catch those ailments if you're born a chick

01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:01.920
That only applies to chick. Is this a scientific fact? Yes, because

01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:08.960
Uh, oh my god. Sorry. I love I'm prompted biology lesson. Let's go. Um, so if you didn't know the male

01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:14.480
The sperm determines the sex of the child of the fetus

01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:18.960
Um, and because of that the male can only pass on a fully

01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:22.320
Full so it's x and y chromosome, right?

01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:29.600
So the dad passes on an x or a y a y is a hundred percent him an x is a hundred percent his mom

01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:34.800
He has no female x inside him if that makes sense. So it's a hundred percent your gran

01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:39.680
It sounds really bizarre, but basically I'm like a hundred percent of my I

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:43.120
It's a weird mix. It's really cool though. I absolutely

01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:49.600
Absolutely love biology when it comes to that your mom is always an x your mom will always give you an x

01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:54.240
So like the reason why men have nipples is to pass down genetic information

01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:58.800
For breastfeeding. That's why some men actually end up having like breast tissue

01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:04.320
It's completely natural completely normal men are a hundred percent susceptible to breast cancer as well

01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:10.240
Please do not think you are immune if you ever find a lump or anything. Do not be embarrassed

01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:15.840
I assure you you are not the only man on earth that may ever have a lump in their breast. This is

01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:19.680
It is perfectly natural. It is perfectly normal. Do not be embarrassed

01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:21.120
I cannot

01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:27.680
Emphasize how much any healthcare worker has seen everything at the point at the point you present your symptoms

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.960
The healthcare worker has seen everything

01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:32.880
Okay

01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:36.720
No, your genetic can be really messed up. You can have like disorders and all that

01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:39.680
Um

01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:41.680
I have tds to potentially have dark

01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:46.560
Yes, you need to pass on the genetic mammary gland information because mammals are

01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:49.920
Um milk producing so some

01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:55.200
Animals take a chicken for example a little chicken gets all its nutrients from the egg

01:56:55.200 --> 01:57:00.320
It's all it'll need. It does not need a milk supply. It uses a yolk sac for example to grow

01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:04.080
Um, whereas mammals are term

01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:08.080
Usually are born a much younger much

01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:16.240
Unable to do things especially humans are a fantastic example of mammals being unable to do anything for a very long time

01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:20.800
But the reason for that is because the circumference of the head of the baby

01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:26.400
Um babies need to be born essentially before full gestation

01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:32.160
Because it would um perish the mother so humans evolved to

01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:35.760
Give birth around the nine month mark. But actually

01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:42.000
Fun factoid the embryo normally is 10 months old by the time it comes out

01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:45.920
Yes, the brain still needs to develop a massive example of

01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:49.360
Um, the development stage is called ossification

01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:56.080
Um children are born with a lot more bones than adults end up with and um

01:57:56.720 --> 01:57:59.440
ossification is the process of your

01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:03.920
Bones um coming together a fusing together

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:08.240
Which is why babies cannot crawl until usually the six month mark

01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:14.240
But uh milestones and children aren't necessarily an indication of good health bad health

01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:16.960
Everyone is different. That is why um

01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:25.520
A lot of mothers in healthcare are ossification no ossification like oseph something like that

01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:27.600
I can't spell the rest of it

01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:30.000
But

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.200
Yeah, like um

01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:36.080
That's why like you might have a story saying like I completely skip the crawl phase

01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:39.600
Some children completely skip the crawl phase. They don't even need to do it

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.040
Um, they have no desire to do it and then they'll just up and walk

01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:48.800
Um after a certain amount of months has formed. It's fantastic. Honestly, it's quite fascinating

01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:54.320
Um to think like I'm sure you guys might have funny stories that your mom was all freaked out being like

01:58:54.400 --> 01:59:02.320
Ah my poor baby boy wasn't doing this and that and it's like no, it's fine. Don't be silly the only cause for concern

01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:04.800
um

01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:08.080
Really is a child that cannot latch

01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:11.120
It's probably the massive are you joking?

01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:14.800
Um

01:59:14.800 --> 01:59:16.800
I need a queen now

01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:19.520
I was gonna go for a flush

01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:21.600
Um

01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:29.920
I was a quick talker not a quick walker. Yes, absolutely fun fact skipping the crawl phase is a major sign of dyspraxia

01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:33.840
Condition is hard baby. Literally those can't control forelimbs at once. Yes

01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:38.160
That's why you had to do tummy time as well to help raise your neck muscles

01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:43.280
Because babies pretty much have knee neck muscles to save their the life of them

01:59:43.440 --> 01:59:47.760
They like violently swing their head around just like so crazy

01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:51.200
Um, oh what am I gonna try and achieve here?

01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:57.360
I was gonna go for a flush with hearts, but I only have two discards left

01:59:58.160 --> 02:00:00.720
And I've got a bit of a high thing going on here

02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:06.960
I was cartwheeling out of the wind feels good man. Honestly come flying out

02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:13.360
Well, I actually got four of a kind which is so rare

02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:18.960
Sorry, I got so distracted I stopped playing the game. Um

02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:23.680
Hmm

02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:33.840
Hmm, have I just shot myself in the foot doing such a pit manoeuvre

02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:40.640
I think we're gonna have to get rid of them

02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:43.200
Yeah, I'm gonna say try and go for doubles like this

02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:47.680
Hmm, I don't lose honestly

02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:53.920
Uh, this is definitely not oh, of course, he's ready to pop now when I didn't need him

02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:57.120
No, these are rubbish. I mean

02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:00.480
At least we win but I didn't he need

02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:03.920
Oh

02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:09.760
Well, I guess pop on the jack then I didn't even realize we were up against that thing

02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:16.640
But that's funny. Okay. We did it. We did it somehow. We did it a christmas freaking miracle 11 dollar. He does

02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:23.280
Will we go out for two pairs

02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:33.840
I think we're gonna shape our deck with two pairs shout out to all my pairs

02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:37.680
You're the only thing keeping us alive right now

02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:43.440
So does splash not complement two pairs

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:47.600
I don't oh I do not

02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:54.240
Does splash not complement two pairs? I don't know. I don't know

02:01:57.520 --> 02:01:59.520
We're gonna have to shape it now

02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:01.840
We don't have a choice

02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:03.840
Splash works for extra two cards

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:09.440
Then what get rid of loyalty card? No, not really splash is good if you have a lot of junk cards

02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:11.760
Mmm

02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:22.080
All right, we're shape we're gonna have to shape it now or we are basically accept and defeat

02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:24.560
So you'll have to forgive me

02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:30.320
I'm going to do something very painful and you're not gonna like it

02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:36.400
And you're not gonna like it

02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:41.440
But we have to do it now or else we have lost lost

02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:46.720
We're going for two pairs. So let's go for uranis. Of course. It doesn't show up because why would it

02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:49.360
Because why would it show up right now?

02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:52.080
Why would it show up?

02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:55.520
Why not sell the egg? It's currently giving me a 10 plus at the moment

02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:58.480
Um

02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:01.040
Until we get

02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:04.160
Don't mind if I do

02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:10.080
Don't mind if I do you're not gonna like it, but we're going for two pairs shout out to all my pairs

02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:21.920
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right my baby don't mess around because

02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:25.040
Because it's out for show

02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:28.240
Oh, and that joker just came in

02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:31.040
These two are gonna come in clutch pretty much

02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:37.360
Yep, and I got an uranis, which is exactly what I wanted to see. We're doing it. We're we're going in two pairs two pairs

02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:39.520
It just seems to be the matter

02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:41.520
What are you mister?

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Oh

02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:47.520
I'm coming. Oh

02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:50.320
Great. Okay

02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:53.440
Egg you have done us

02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:56.320
Christmas miracles, but your time is up

02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:00.720
Your time is up

02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:03.760
Your time is up. Oh my god

02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:06.640
Right, come on uranis

02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:10.640
Yep. Okay. Okay. We shaped it at the most perfect time

02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:15.040
How are we looking we want to do highs maybe

02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:20.560
Ain't nothing can you teach us more about this female biology?

02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:26.640
I was actually gonna do a sex education stream just for the hell of it. Um, because I quite find I find it quite fascinating

02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:31.360
Hmm

02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:36.480
Sure

02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:43.840
Um after play or discard always draw three cards like more

02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:50.480
After player discard always draw three cards like three cards only

02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:56.000
I know there's a flush there, but we're going for doubles so

02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:07.600
We learned so much every stream. Well, I was gonna this sounds absolutely terrible. I was going to get a pair of

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:14.720
Basically model balls and like I was gonna do ASMR like examining your

02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:18.080
Um

02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:22.080
But obviously with youtube kind of switching things up. I guess that might be a twitter video

02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:25.920
Actually, I remember many I need to put that video on twitter. I'm so sorry

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:29.760
I don't know why I keep coming up with cursed ideas, but I can't help it like it's fucking hilarious

02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:36.560
I'm like I'm sorry, but imagine like ASMR me with my hands like and I've like got my nails on like oh

02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:40.960
Sorry, I forgot to put my gloves on he he no pay no patient contact direct contact. Sorry

02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:45.200
And I'll be like oh lovely nice and shaved for me. Thank you

02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:48.080
and

02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:54.960
That curse it's all good. We're into it. Literally. I'm like I can't stop coming up with like these silly gives me ideas

02:05:55.120 --> 02:05:57.120
It just makes me giggle so much

02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:02.560
I don't know like it. It just brings me so much joy, right? So we have three

02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:09.360
We have three to turn into hearts, which I'm actually gonna oh wait hold on

02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:15.520
We actually want more hearts because of this little guy. Oh wait idea. There was another one that has a diamond

02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:24.960
That's okay to be dumb. I'm allowed to be dumb. I'm allowed to be dumb

02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:32.000
Being dumb is not bad being bad. It doesn't mean I'm dumb. Well, I am dumb, but you know what I mean

02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:40.080
All I can think of you going to whip no no like I would be like proper like whispering ASMR like

02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:43.760
Just be like thank you for coming to the clinic. You got any concerns? I see

02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:47.040
um

02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:50.320
You're too late

02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:54.640
You're too late the disrespect you have shown me you're too late

02:06:56.320 --> 02:06:58.640
Greedy Joker lusty Joker

02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:01.120
Clever Joker

02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:06.160
Mad Joker clever. I remember I used to always get called the clever girl in primary school

02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:08.160
to be like, oh, you're such a clever girl scrawny

02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:12.320
Self-right you're complimenting me mr. Teacher. Well, miss teacher

02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:16.480
If it's a miss if it's a miss relax relax relax, right?

02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:19.440
Relax no play

02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:21.440
It's called a humor

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Square Joker should I get it?

02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:30.080
I don't know. I feel like it's too late for him. Like I've got three plus multiplier when certain car a plus

02:07:30.800 --> 02:07:34.560
Not times, but he just gives four check like you're too late, bro

02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:39.040
Bro, you're actually too late for bro. Right. We're gonna skip because we're getting a negative Joker

02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:41.600
All heart cards are debuff. That's fine

02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:45.520
That's absolutely fine with me. Are you kidding me?

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:52.400
You're telling me that I don't have a second double

02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:02.800
I

02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:06.960
Right, we're just playing doubles. I know that's the buffed and that's the buffed as well

02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:10.480
I know I know play the flush

02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:14.880
No, I have to go in on doubles everything is stark for doubles now

02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:17.920
so I can't

02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:20.640
I have to be a good girl and play doubles

02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:23.360
We can't be tempted ill of fate

02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:26.560
We must be good. Okay

02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:33.360
Is there not double have I thrown so many cards away? There's no doubles. Oh, there's oh wait idiot. There's one right there

02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:39.600
It's cuz it's blanked out. Okay. It's cuz they're blanked out. I'm dumb

02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:44.000
All these curse medically some words are just gonna be in different rooms of the same building

02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:46.800
Literally, right. What are you?

02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:53.120
That's a shame, but I mean a Joker is a Joker

02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:55.360
If it's a flush

02:08:57.920 --> 02:09:00.400
Yeah, that's a shame. That's a shame. That's a shame

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:07.600
But we're gonna start redeeming packs. Our economy is good to go honestly. Sure. What's a turret if it's not a carrot?

02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:11.760
And oh we can get 20 bucks back a steel card

02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:15.840
Steel cards might be your saving grace

02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:17.840
I

02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:23.360
Dare I say a steel card might be your saving grace

02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:28.240
If we can get a few more steel cards, uh, I would not be upset

02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:34.320
What we looking at what we looking at creates two copies of one selected card in your hand

02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:41.360
Diamond creates two copies of the selected card

02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:44.720
Whoa, wait, that's

02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:46.000
Three tall

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
I'm by that anyway

02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:53.680
And then let's go again what we're going here next base shop is a polychrome

02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:57.280
I'm full

02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:02.320
There's no more room at the end. You can only tempt me with negative jokers now

02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:07.120
Unless I sacrifice one of these for it

02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:10.560
Oh

02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:14.320
Oh, I'm sacrificing. I'm sacrificing so hard right now

02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:21.360
On top of that the doctor one running between the room is changing outfits honestly

02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:29.520
Um, right. I will if I have three aces of diamond, I'll get rid of um the heart joker

02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:35.760
Are you just like saws but the game actually is

02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:38.640
going against me

02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:44.240
Just say you hate me. It's fine. Just say you don't like me. You don't you don't have to spell it out with the cards

02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:47.200
Okay, there we go

02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:54.960
Greedy and lusty are plus three easy to repair. Yeah, I'm gonna swap out lust

02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:00.000
For whatever this hidden guy is what are you?

02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:02.720
Play dices

02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:04.000
Okay

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:07.920
Right. Goodbye lusty. You've done is pretty good to get here

02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:11.200
Oh wait, you won't

02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:16.720
I

02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:21.840
No point in getting rid of him because I mean he might come in clutch somewhere

02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:26.880
You need to go there then you're at 1.5. So you need to go over

02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:36.160
And then we hope for urinus. Oh my a bit of urinus don't mind if I do

02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:41.840
Uh, and then a full house technically contains a doubly. So I'll take it

02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:48.240
I miss tours again, but how's it going? It's going good ish. We won our first move

02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:51.600
We had to pivot in the middle of this one

02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:54.240
There is a chance

02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:57.600
There is a chance, but we're having to

02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:01.360
Be very

02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:03.840
Mmm

02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:13.360
We're having to be on our best behavior

02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:18.240
Because this isn't easy

02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:22.080
I would like to keep you

02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:27.360
We're having we're going it all in on two pairs yet again. It seems to be the best strategy

02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:29.840
Just two pairs over and over again

02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:32.640
Um

02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:35.600
Just because just because

02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:40.640
Oh my god urinus fantastic

02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:44.720
It's not guaranteed though

02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:52.080
It's definitely not guaranteed. What do you do not discovered? I mean we'll discover it because we can

02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:56.720
Um

02:12:56.800 --> 02:12:59.280
Playing cards, maybe if we can get another one of them

02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:02.720
What are you? Whoa

02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:10.880
That's op is fuck

02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:14.720
Yeah, sorry, I know it's a low number, but that's so op

02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:20.080
Hey, we are just gonna go on a bit of a buying. Oh, we got the fill

02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:28.880
We're gonna use the fill. I'm sorry. We're gonna use it. It's it's keeping us above the requirements for the round

02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:38.640
Hand size next very large blind. I can't swap that out. So we're gonna have to hopefully level up urinus

02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:45.280
No one else is sorry, let me check the lens

02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:53.520
Net and well, there's no point in that because it doesn't work. Um, low number doesn't matter when you're stacking ballies anywhere. Yeah

02:13:57.200 --> 02:14:05.200
Oh when blind is selected gain three, but lose all this. Whoa, that is punishing. Why would anyone want that?

02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:07.440
Oh

02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:15.840
Okay, an ace gives me a bit extra on top two pair two pair

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:24.960
On a diamond, okay, we're in it. We're in it to win it. I don't know if we have it. It's not guaranteed. Oh, okay

02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:33.280
We want to level up urinus. We really do. Sorry, I know I keep calling it urinus

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:39.120
Okay, that's good

02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:43.920
We get a level up as well, which is absolutely fantastic

02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:49.840
What are you when blind is like to create two no and then a straight no

02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:54.240
Urinus again any urin any urinuses? Whoa

02:14:58.480 --> 02:15:00.480
Hello, yeah

02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:05.600
Big beak close enough, okay

02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:12.000
By okay, okay black hole all hands plus one now curious

02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:17.760
Curious indeed, right we will spend everything after this

02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:22.240
We will spend every penny we can muster

02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:29.520
Now we do have a 1.5 in here as well. So we are gonna play and throw with seven

02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:32.480
Try and get higher doubles

02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:40.320
Yeah, yeah, okay, and then we'll play our aces and our tens and we've done that round

02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:46.720
How much does that get okay, we definitely need ace plays

02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:51.520
In order to do this big bang right we can sell everything

02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:56.400
Urinus any urinuses close enough absolutely. We've got one

02:15:56.400 --> 02:16:05.680
Two turret cards, let's see what we're looking at and now give me us we can go all out on urinus

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:19.600
Someone says yeah, right we'll use the urinus so we're gonna use that now that's perfect and then we've got

02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:27.280
So like two cards convert the left into the right

02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:35.680
Do we want another two?

02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:46.960
Selling the left joker make another steal. That's what I'm thinking as well

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:58.000
What are we looking at for the lower numbers other the odds of everything is actually on par other than higher aces and jacks

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:05.760
Turn the four into a steal, okay, and let's just slight two cards convert the left into the right

02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:09.760
Okay, we now have two a lot twos

02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:12.320
Give him a lot enema enema give him an enema

02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:15.200
um

02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:17.760
No

02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:20.720
Mm-hmm

02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:23.520
Creates a copy of a joker destroys a whoa

02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:25.440
No

02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:29.680
What creates a copy of a random, but destroys all other jokers

02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:35.280
No, I think you need to show up a lot earlier than that. Are you couldn't we couldn't even do anything

02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:39.760
We're out of money

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
We didn't even get anything for that

02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:44.960
Hmm

02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:50.000
Okay, hold on we are gonna take our sweet

02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:53.520
our

02:17:53.520 --> 02:17:55.520
time

02:17:56.960 --> 02:17:58.960
I

02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:01.520
Say

02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:07.760
I say get rid of these

02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:10.080
And keep

02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:15.040
No

02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:18.160
Get rid of all of these. I know it's a pair

02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:22.240
But we need the ace

02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:27.360
Anke is good early. Yeah

02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:32.480
How's the gambadix go in we might win or lose. I'm not sure

02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:42.160
We need the aces okay, that's exactly what we needed. However, we don't have a complimentary pair

02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:46.960
So we're gonna do another discard

02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:51.600
Okay, okay, we're cooking by gas

02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:57.920
Shout out to all my pairs. We're gonna throw away the eight and we're gonna see what this ace does

02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:05.360
Um

02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:09.920
Okay

02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:13.280
I'm not

02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:18.960
Mmm

02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:23.520
Oh aces in snowberries we're gambling don't look don't

02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:39.360
Hi snowberries. Hi, I say thank you for redirecting into me. I appreciate you kindly

02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:46.880
Um, hello snowberries. We're gambling today because yesterday I was emotionally distraught after finishing john wick

02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:52.000
Do not finish don't watch john wick if you're not emotionally stable. That's all I'm gonna say all I thought

02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:56.640
John wick was about pew pew. Ha ha cool guy. Uh, no, don't do that

02:19:57.440 --> 02:20:01.600
Bye hi readers. Thank you for joining in. How was aces streamed? Did you enjoy it?

02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:04.560
If I can pull a steel card

02:20:05.200 --> 02:20:06.800
We might be out the gutter

02:20:06.800 --> 02:20:13.200
We are currently on the very last round of a run on a deck that we haven't done a one a win on

02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:17.120
It's a very large bind at 300

02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:22.640
We will win or we will riot is sevens here better instead of tens because of the diamonds

02:20:23.520 --> 02:20:25.520
I don't know

02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:30.800
A stream was a cluster

02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:36.400
What did she do was it it was an ASMR that stream the ac was streaming was it?

02:20:38.400 --> 02:20:40.400
greedy joker

02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:45.280
Is it better with a diamond played cards with diamond give plus three

02:20:48.480 --> 02:20:50.480
We could hold off and use that then

02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:56.160
Oh, you're playing oh, that's right. You were playing guild wars because her

02:20:56.880 --> 02:21:03.120
Her streaming equipment had to be on the lowest setting bless her cotton socks. I yes, I recall now. I recall

02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:12.240
And I didn't shoot yeah, okay, I recall yeah her she had to put it on the lowest graphics. I recall I recall

02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:18.240
Also, we gave her a wedding dress and a ring. Oh, and you ran a train on her excuse me

02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:24.240
I beg your finest pardon. You did what in to my icy

02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:27.840
You ran a train on my daughter

02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:32.720
Excuse me

02:21:34.160 --> 02:21:38.960
You you dressed her up like a Barbie doll in a wedding dress and gave her a ring

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
And then you ran a train on my daughter

02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:46.400
And you didn't invite me into the culture. Excuse me

02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:51.120
There was a dog pile at some point you ran a train on ac

02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:55.760
We're at her official daddas now. I'll have you know, okay

02:21:56.640 --> 02:21:58.640
daddas, okay

02:21:59.280 --> 02:22:02.560
You guys have so many nicknames snowberries daddas ojisans

02:22:03.440 --> 02:22:06.000
I like ojisans because of my accent. I'm like, oh

02:22:06.800 --> 02:22:10.960
Come in a side ojisans like my accent makes this a stronger

02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:13.520
The culture spot was taken rude

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
That's my chair. I'll have you know

02:22:16.080 --> 02:22:18.080
What was that about chair?

02:22:18.720 --> 02:22:20.720
Right, we're doing it. We're doing it

02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:25.920
We've got an ace. We've got a diamond to activate on both these the eight will not count

02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:29.360
And we've got one hand remaining so we need to

02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:37.760
Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Oh, what does it mean?

02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:44.480
I have the odds to pull one more ace

02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:47.440
I have to go for the ace

02:22:55.920 --> 02:23:02.160
Oh my god, this is so close. This is come on game. Give me the ace streamer luck. Oh

02:23:03.520 --> 02:23:07.760
Okay, okay. We have pulled the ace. I repeat we have pulled the ace

02:23:08.720 --> 02:23:16.400
We might as well discard the lore in case of a diamond pool of 10

02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:22.320
In case of a diamond pool on 10

02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:27.360
Yes

02:23:28.720 --> 02:23:35.520
I might as well get rid of the jack and I might as well get rid of the king and pull for diamond 10

02:23:38.640 --> 02:23:45.040
Yep. Yep. This is the best way to do it and maybe a steal

02:23:47.840 --> 02:23:52.480
Unlucky well we can submit our jacks then

02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:58.720
They didn't pull the two such a shame they didn't pull the two

02:23:58.720 --> 02:24:00.720
I

02:24:04.960 --> 02:24:12.960
Want to use the tens for scholar scholar scholar played aces give

02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:20.080
This is it. This is the best we can do

02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:22.160
I

02:24:26.240 --> 02:24:30.000
Throw the two out there. Why not? I'm just giving them a little two

02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:36.560
We don't even have anything like that. I just give them a two as a tip. Okay

02:24:39.280 --> 02:24:41.280
Okay, well

02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:45.840
Let's see

02:24:46.400 --> 02:24:48.400
Do we do it

02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:51.360
Do we do it? Oh

02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:55.040
Hey

02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:04.720
No

02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:07.120
Oh

02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:26.160
We say a ball here in scots like oh if it's really close you go. Oh, that was a ball here

02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:28.480
right

02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:32.080
One more run and then I'm going to redirect into she be because

02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:38.400
This is a shorter stream because I am uploading the girls as highlights from debut

02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:41.120
I'm just going to check if the she be streaming cotton bum

02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:46.880
A bit of she be cotton bum. Yeah, she might be live. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Is she having a break today? Yeah

02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:50.160
Oh my gosh. She's having a break. How did I can't believe it?

02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:55.280
I can't believe the girls that be allure are making sure they're healthy and okay, uh

02:25:56.320 --> 02:25:59.840
Uh on emmy's off emmy's off as well. Okay. Um

02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:03.280
Uh, uh, okay. Okay. Hold on

02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:08.160
So it's mersey on or am I the last one up? I'm the last one off

02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:10.720
Oh, no

02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:12.560
Oh, no, this can't be

02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:16.320
I was a mersey's having a day off too. Right. Hold on. Hold the phone

02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:24.160
Hold the phone we can do something about this hear me out

02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:26.720
I

02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:30.960
Could in theory

02:26:31.120 --> 02:26:32.800
go away for

02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:34.160
five

02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:36.560
It's not gonna work. It's not gonna work. Vila is gone

02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:40.560
Vila is gone. We can't do it. Right. Hold on. Let's play one more deck

02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:44.880
Uh

02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:48.400
Wow, okay. Let's play one more deck and then we'll redirect into the

02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:52.320
A yumi plus girl because there'd be nothing but kind and lovely to us

02:26:52.880 --> 02:27:00.320
Uh, what about ac ac redirected into me vila has fallen literally everyone like oh, how can I possibly keep up with vila streams?

02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:02.400
Well, you can now

02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:03.680
She

02:27:03.680 --> 02:27:06.320
Okay, I will make a deal we'll play one more round

02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:09.600
I'm gonna very quickly make a cup of tea and go for a pee we'll play one more round

02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:12.800
We'll redirect into a yumi plus girl once I go offline

02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:17.600
You will start to notice that the highlights of the girl's debuts go up again

02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:21.920
I will do it in order of who debuted first. So it goes ac and azura then

02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:25.760
Mercy then emmy then she be then me last. Okay

02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:29.200
So they're all gonna pop up roughly at the same time

02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:33.360
Like uh, maybe 15 minutes apart because it takes a while to fucking do all the descriptions

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
But please do look out for that

02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:38.640
Do I want a cup of tea?

02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:40.640
I don't know. I'm a feeling a cup of tea

02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:43.520
Or do I just want to go again?

02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:45.840
The plane has hit vila headquarters

02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:49.920
And the funny thing is we actually do have a headquarters, which is the most funniest

02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:56.800
We we considered accepting mail at the headquarters location on behalf of the girls, but it's not possible

02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:01.520
Um

02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:05.120
We thought about it because we were we discussed having po boxes

02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:11.760
But um, unfortunately with the rise of air tags and trackers we cannot accept mail at anyone

02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:17.040
I said to the girls I was like not then you open up po boxes. I understand if you're interested

02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:19.920
At first I was gonna test it out myself. Um

02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:27.920
Because I can get packages sent to the headquarters. I know that sounds fucking ridiculous, but there is like, I know

02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:30.320
Yeah, believe it or not. Um

02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:32.320
But then I was like

02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:35.200
I would have to open up all the packages

02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:39.440
At the headquarters location to make sure there's no air tags or anything

02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:41.920
Um, or any biohazard stuff

02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:46.000
And then it was like I was gonna have to rent out a freaking conference room

02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:49.040
And then I was gonna have to go through all the packages and then it kind of defeats the

02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:52.880
This surprise because like opening stuff up on stream is like quite funny

02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:55.440
You want an officer? I mean

02:28:56.800 --> 02:28:58.800
I mean

02:28:59.280 --> 02:29:02.240
I can give you a boardroom meeting tour if you want man

02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:05.280
Like the actual boardrooms

02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:09.280
How am I supposed to poison the staff? Why would you want to poison the staff? What the fuck?

02:29:09.920 --> 02:29:11.920
I'm part of the staff the fuck

02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:18.160
Better keep it safe virtual headquarters. Nope physical location headquarters

02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:24.080
Actual physical location headquarters. I know cringe

02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:30.720
How did she do it ladies and gentlemen mods just that man's balls mods get that man. Don't leave us moment

02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:33.040
Wait, so no cup of tea or cup of tea

02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:38.080
Um, you'd also have to check the inside of the item for an air tag. Yeah, like the

02:29:38.800 --> 02:29:40.800
It just gets so dangerous

02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:44.240
Unless I was to record the video at the headquarters

02:29:44.800 --> 02:29:47.840
And then take back what I desired

02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:51.840
A new was safe home and I would have to buy like a tracker as well

02:29:51.840 --> 02:29:53.840
But tracker devices don't always work

02:29:54.160 --> 02:29:56.160
tracker detector

02:29:56.560 --> 02:30:02.960
Wouldn't you get a higher sniff dog? No, I don't think can dogs sense like motherboards and stuff

02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:06.000
And

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:12.640
Yeah, I know it's a shame because I would absolutely enjoy being streamers do like those like accepting your packages type things

02:30:13.200 --> 02:30:16.080
And like someone like sprays fart spray or something on it

02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:20.960
Although I think one of the sadder ones I caught was like someone sent someone ladybugs

02:30:21.120 --> 02:30:26.800
But they all died and I was like that is actually really sad. It's not much of a prank is it if

02:30:28.080 --> 02:30:30.080
We little things perish for it

02:30:32.160 --> 02:30:35.520
But you could also just amp the box. Oh, let me just oh, sorry

02:30:35.920 --> 02:30:40.080
I forgot to mention have amp grenades just sitting next to my seed collection. Yeah

02:30:41.120 --> 02:30:42.080
Um

02:30:42.080 --> 02:30:45.280
Don't send live animals or insects in the milk. Yeah, it was like

02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:49.280
I can't remember if it made like headlines or whatever

02:30:49.680 --> 02:30:56.000
But someone purchased like 10 000 ladybugs and sent it. But obviously, you know, there is no

02:30:57.600 --> 02:30:59.200
um

02:30:59.200 --> 02:31:01.200
There was no

02:31:01.680 --> 02:31:05.280
Like refrigeration to put them to sleep in the travel

02:31:05.680 --> 02:31:09.360
It was like in the heat in the boxes getting thrown about and when they arrive

02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:13.920
Obviously, they all had perished and I seem to remember that story in particular because I'm so sad

02:31:15.360 --> 02:31:20.640
It feels weird man. As long as there's no iphone within 100 meters. Don't air tags not work. Just open them up and

02:31:21.520 --> 02:31:23.520
I have no idea

02:31:24.080 --> 02:31:26.800
Sadly doggos can't sniff out an rtx 490

02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:32.080
Kind of better that they died. They could be invasive. Uh ladybugs are invasive

02:31:34.240 --> 02:31:38.160
Little ladybug little ladybird. We we actually say ladybird in the uk

02:31:39.040 --> 02:31:40.480
Little ladybird

02:31:40.480 --> 02:31:45.760
Wouldn't a microwave do this? You want me to microwave everything that comes through in the packages? Just shove it in there

02:31:46.640 --> 02:31:48.640
No, that's fine. It's fine. Just shove in

02:31:51.680 --> 02:31:53.680
It depends on the breed

02:31:53.760 --> 02:31:55.760
Harley Quinn ladybugs. Okay

02:31:57.280 --> 02:31:58.880
I'm gonna name that right

02:31:58.880 --> 02:32:05.200
Start the run with no face cards in your deck. Let's see how bad this is and it's called abandoned deck

02:32:05.680 --> 02:32:14.800
We do have an uncommon joker for free. So I might be interested in that. What are you after gain 25 economies?

02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:25.920
That is more money than we'll make doing that. Right. Fuck it. We're going all in boys. We're going all in

02:32:28.160 --> 02:32:31.920
Wait, so we still get aces. We just don't get okay. Okay. So get aces

02:32:32.080 --> 02:32:36.880
Uh, let's throw you guys away

02:32:38.720 --> 02:32:40.880
Wow, that did nothing. Please don't ever do that again

02:32:43.120 --> 02:32:45.120
Okay, we've got a full house. Let's go

02:32:46.880 --> 02:32:51.280
I'm gonna send myself to valer hq. Oh, do you remember that prank?

02:32:52.160 --> 02:32:58.640
Um, we're like these people claim they ship themselves and then an airline had to come out and be like, don't be so effing ridiculous

02:32:58.640 --> 02:33:05.840
Of course these people didn't ship themselves through a fucking box or something because they like it was like a prank youtube channel

02:33:05.840 --> 02:33:08.320
And they were oh, yeah, we totally shipped ourselves

02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:15.360
And it was like don't be so ridiculous like the airline had to get involved in publicly like denounce them

02:33:16.160 --> 02:33:21.360
For being so silly. Wow. Okay. Yes. That was that was definitely worth it. Right. You're free

02:33:22.320 --> 02:33:25.600
Sell this card to create a free double tag. What does that even mean?

02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:30.320
This joker gains when a booster pack is skipped

02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:43.840
Interesting if your airship a living creature is cargo what you get at the other end of the corpse basically

02:33:45.840 --> 02:33:51.760
Face cards hardy hardy hard adds double the rank of the lowest card. I mean that's better than nothing

02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:56.160
If I skip a booster pack, I mean, I might as well go down there

02:33:56.960 --> 02:34:00.960
Not really fuss for consumable slow at this point in time

02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:04.960
What are we up against? Oh, we've got a negative

02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:08.400
All heart cards are too fast

02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:11.680
Well

02:34:12.560 --> 02:34:14.560
Next round I guess

02:34:14.800 --> 02:34:20.960
All right, we're gonna go for the negative. We're gonna select a booster pack a booster pack any booster pack lovers

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.640
We'll go for a pair and throw away the four of you

02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:31.600
Open tarot and skip it. Oh wait, if you open the the pack and then skip it it adds to it

02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:34.400
I thought it meant skip it entirely. Okay, that makes

02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:37.200
slightly more sense

02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:44.400
Than the way I envisioned it in my head. I'm here. I'm here. I do apologize for that one. Okay. I understand then

02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:48.800
This is the first time I've had this guy involved. So we're getting there

02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:54.000
Right air in five bucks if three or more face cards

02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:04.560
I might as well buy it and sell it I guess

02:35:06.800 --> 02:35:10.480
What a joke I skipped for that

02:35:11.200 --> 02:35:19.840
Right, so if I buy and then skip it, which is fine. I'm happy to skip that. That's not really a big deal

02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:21.600
and skip

02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:22.720
Oh

02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:24.720
Whoa, okay

02:35:24.960 --> 02:35:26.960
Bye

02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:29.120
What do you do plan out?

02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:32.640
That's actually pretty good. Hold on a minute

02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:38.960
Oh, you need to face your problems. I can't believe it. I have no face cards

02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:41.520
That's honestly pretty good though

02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:47.920
But if I skip

02:35:48.880 --> 02:35:50.320
Yeah

02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:57.760
I'm going to do the tarot card one because it naturally gives us the goods. I don't really need a consumable swap. So, you know

02:35:58.960 --> 02:36:00.960
already have

02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:06.720
Nine eight seven six five four three two. Of course. I don't have what I need

02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:10.480
Give me a seven or something. Whoa

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.960
Uh, you never normally do that for me. So thanks buddy

02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:21.520
Ten nine eight seven six, so

02:36:22.560 --> 02:36:24.560
You ever do these two?

02:36:27.280 --> 02:36:30.560
Sugar I only have one more discard left

02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:35.040
So what I need a seven

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:42.640
Are the odds of a seven? Oh seven's pretty high. Fuck it. You know what you know what you cheeky fuck

02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:49.600
You cheeky

02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:56.160
You cheeky cheeky right, but we've got three more hands. So it's fine. But I need a seven or five or something

02:36:56.560 --> 02:36:58.560
Oh

02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:02.080
This game has jokes

02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:12.880
Nothing but jokes clearly why did I get four there?

02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:18.880
What did you I don't know

02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:21.360
I mean, I guess

02:37:22.080 --> 02:37:24.240
I wasn't even paying attention. Okay

02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:31.520
If first hand of round has only one card add a permanent copy to deck and

02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:34.000
to deck

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
and you come

02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:38.080
and you come

02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:40.640
And then again if we

02:37:41.680 --> 02:37:44.720
Yeah, if first hand of round

02:37:44.880 --> 02:37:53.680
Has only one card plate add a permanent copy of that card to the deck and draw it to the hand

02:37:57.040 --> 02:37:59.040
Okay

02:37:59.520 --> 02:38:01.920
Right, we're gonna skip these to get a little busty-wusty

02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:04.240
unless

02:38:04.240 --> 02:38:06.240
Should we go out all out on aces?

02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:10.480
Fuck it. If it's got an ace, I'm taking it. If it's got an ace, I'm taking it

02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:15.440
Uh, we're gonna skip that and then we're gonna add to a little multiplier here

02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:18.000
What are you?

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:22.720
Planet card uncommon joker for free first hand is drawn face down

02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:25.600
right

02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:27.600
He's twitching. He's ready

02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:32.000
Yeah, we're going all out on aces. Fuck it

02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:38.160
She we've got five aces now

02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:45.520
The unit works well for four of the kinds of clone 800 aces literally and that's the plan

02:38:46.400 --> 02:38:48.400
10 9 8 7

02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:54.080
Of course, that was too good to be true. Let's do double b's and five why not?

02:38:56.960 --> 02:38:58.960
Surely this is the correct move

02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:04.480
Oh, we did it. Oh, wow. Okay. That was good. That was good. Um

02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:10.400
Sell the card to disable the current no

02:39:15.840 --> 02:39:21.520
So what am I going for? I don't know. I don't really know what I'm going for

02:39:27.360 --> 02:39:29.360
Just skip

02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:33.360
I don't really have anything shaping what we want to do at the moment

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:35.120
Um

02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:38.960
Never seen this game before. What's the goal? It's like a

02:39:39.760 --> 02:39:43.440
Someone says it's a rogue like but with poker mechanics. Yes

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Um, there's a lot of different aspects to the game. It's gonna look absolutely chaotic right now. Um,

02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:53.760
But it's quite an easy and tampering since free money

02:39:54.880 --> 02:39:56.880
You make money forever

02:39:56.960 --> 02:39:58.960
Oh

02:39:59.280 --> 02:40:01.120
Yes, basically

02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:07.360
I don't know if it's better to skip to keep getting this up. I feel like that's gonna add up over time like really big

02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:11.760
I'm sure I'm gonna regret it, but

02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:16.400
Oh wait, I could have got more money to buy more packs. You know what?

02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:20.320
I might not be the smartest, but I'm here for a good time again

02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:23.520
We're gonna have to skip because we don't even have anything that

02:40:24.160 --> 02:40:25.920
is

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:30.080
Shaping our deck other than this really doubles the lowest

02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:35.440
I don't even know what that means and we're gonna try and get more aces. What's going on here?

02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:38.880
Did we go for a free joker?

02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:45.200
Fuck it

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Oh, this is terrible

02:40:48.880 --> 02:40:59.280
Now the odds of us pilling an ace are high so what if we just no don't sell it you give her play

02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:06.480
Okay

02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:09.920
Okay, okay, okay

02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:15.120
Okay

02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:17.600
Then we just throw it away

02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:20.880
Which is a shame to do

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:28.480
Now I'm noticing this one isn't budging anywhere which makes me think it's an ace

02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:39.380
I'm gonna regret this but hey, oh right. We've got a duple V and we'll get rid of the three

02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:53.280
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I mean we're kind of looking at two pair again, especially with the amount of aces we're getting

02:41:56.640 --> 02:42:00.560
And we're about to get a Saturn no urenus close enough

02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:06.240
Close enough close enough right urenus will level up her two pair rewards

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.800
I can't get away from two pairs. I honestly can't eat

02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:13.040
Okay

02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:18.400
Not the best

02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:21.520
Because we actually want to keep skipping packs that we open

02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:25.120
One, you know, we'll just buy everything

02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:31.680
Multi-card steel card joker must have room. Well, I just lost room so

02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:36.480
You could have tried for a four of a kind on the aces

02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:40.800
Yes, we're going to work towards that

02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:44.480
Right, we're gonna buy these and skip them

02:42:45.920 --> 02:42:47.600
a sigil and

02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:53.680
Yeah, again, not really a Ouija just sounds like a terrible idea. Converse all cards in hand to a single random suit

02:42:53.840 --> 02:42:59.040
No, we're not doing flushes. We're doing double base. We're gonna skip. We've got now plus 15 on this bad boy

02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:01.280
Again, we're gonna open up a joker

02:43:02.960 --> 02:43:04.480
No

02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:08.560
We're gonna skip again. We've just never plus 18. We're absolutely

02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:11.920
Having a good time with him. We're gonna see if we're gonna duplicate

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:26.240
Would we give what would we give up sell this card to create a free double tag? What does that even mean?

02:43:29.600 --> 02:43:33.840
What is a double tag gives a copy of the next selected tag

02:43:34.480 --> 02:43:36.480
So

02:43:36.720 --> 02:43:38.720
That what

02:43:45.120 --> 02:43:47.620
Next time you skip the effect happens twice

02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:02.320
Huh all right you're twitching

02:44:04.880 --> 02:44:06.880
You

02:44:09.680 --> 02:44:11.680
Steel steel ace

02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:24.160
Beautiful oh that actually played for you a bit of money there a steel card steal the two

02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:28.880
And then we've got two multipliers on the deck

02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:33.360
And then do what up here

02:44:35.280 --> 02:44:43.520
Not the two put it on the sick

02:44:47.520 --> 02:44:49.520
Um

02:44:54.640 --> 02:44:57.680
I don't know what to try and roll for maybe another ace

02:44:59.280 --> 02:45:04.000
Keep the four try and roll for an ace. Okay. There you go. There you go. Exactly what we wanted

02:45:04.640 --> 02:45:10.560
Uh, throw me the two. Um, we've got two. Yeah, hold on. We're gonna end up with you

02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:16.560
Hey

02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:19.520
How much work was the cola putting in?

02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:26.080
That wasn't that really wasn't that good

02:45:26.320 --> 02:45:28.320
So

02:45:32.480 --> 02:45:34.480
Hey, I'm gonna lose

02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:43.200
The cola did nothing

02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:51.920
Oh, but I'm gonna get two holographics if I win though easy win on what show me what four ever came

02:45:56.880 --> 02:45:58.880
There's two more aces to pull

02:46:00.400 --> 02:46:02.400
Could do five of a kind

02:46:02.640 --> 02:46:04.720
What should I just try and pull for another ace?

02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:11.760
Five of a kind should be more than enough bloody. Oh, so

02:46:13.280 --> 02:46:20.240
Oh, there you go. I still could technically get another one. Fuck it. Ah, I could do imagine though

02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:27.040
So what I want to do these four and then have the 1.5 and 1.5

02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:32.240
I'm okay. We're saying goodbye to the planet. It's not the biggest deal five aces

02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:40.720
Oh, that's way stronger. Holy crap. Yeah, that's way stronger

02:46:43.040 --> 02:46:45.040
All right

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:53.520
God that was not a rolling smoke though. These two negative jokers we're gonna get they better be good. It not negative

02:46:55.120 --> 02:46:57.120
Are you joking me?

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:05.760
Right that's free

02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:09.520
So we're gonna get it and then sell it because it's fucking rubbish

02:47:10.480 --> 02:47:15.680
And then we're gonna get the probability one. I know that gives me fat like but it's gonna expire

02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:20.000
I'd rather pick this up than something that expires

02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:23.280
You know

02:47:23.280 --> 02:47:25.280
Like at least this is perma

02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:28.720
So anytime small player you need to go the back

02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:34.480
But you won't plan it any planet card that's used. I might just start buying

02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:37.120
Anyway, I start buying

02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:43.440
Right, we're just gonna start using cards to get this times up. I know I shouldn't and I should skip but

02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:48.160
Fuck we're just ruining our economy for this. It's fine

02:47:48.720 --> 02:47:52.160
Right, and then we're gonna skip and then that will raise him a little bit

02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:55.440
Play only one. Oh, we've lost

02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:03.200
We just need to go for aces

02:48:03.440 --> 02:48:08.640
He says yep aces

02:48:10.320 --> 02:48:12.320
He says

02:48:13.680 --> 02:48:16.480
Shit well, we've only got one hand

02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:24.640
Shopping the day, I don't know who got it. I don't think so

02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:31.280
Oh my god buy a freaking ball here. Whoa not good

02:48:31.280 --> 02:48:35.600
We need we need improvements right now

02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:39.520
Right now we need improvements

02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:49.120
We need improvements right now

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
I think raised fist

02:48:56.720 --> 02:48:58.720
We're gonna swap you out for free

02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:03.680
Yeah, sorry you're we're trying with you, but you're not doing enough

02:49:05.760 --> 02:49:07.760
Um

02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:11.040
We're

02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:14.640
We're needing to level him up. He's gonna come in clutch over time as well

02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:18.720
I

02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:23.120
I know we need to skip packs. I know

02:49:23.360 --> 02:49:29.040
I should maybe level up four of a kind five of a kind later do

02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:41.920
I know I should try and hold on to economy, but we're trying to catch up with the demands

02:49:43.280 --> 02:49:46.720
Of the game right now and it's not doing well

02:49:47.680 --> 02:49:49.680
I

02:49:50.240 --> 02:49:52.240
1.5 I think

02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:59.440
I think yes for 1.5 on something something's gonna get swapped out for a 1.5

02:50:00.560 --> 02:50:05.600
What are you cards played previously or debuffed? Okay lucky me wait, so don't play my fucking aces

02:50:08.080 --> 02:50:15.200
Uh three of a kind I could test out. I am not obviously I don't have a I could discard though for an ace

02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:18.720
Oh

02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:21.360
Oh

02:50:36.080 --> 02:50:44.320
We leveled up ten wait hold on let's check three of a kind is like a thousand

02:50:46.800 --> 02:50:51.600
And then two pairs what's four of a kind four of a kind

02:50:52.880 --> 02:50:56.000
Is weaker so three of a kind for now

02:51:03.280 --> 02:51:05.280
And then another three of a kind

02:51:07.760 --> 02:51:10.240
Four of a kind fives they're weaker though

02:51:10.480 --> 02:51:11.600
So

02:51:11.600 --> 02:51:19.440
Wait, but this will let me level up four of a kind which I want for the aces because I'm going to keep duplicating the aces

02:51:20.720 --> 02:51:22.720
Yes

02:51:23.280 --> 02:51:25.280
I would like to duplicate the aces

02:51:25.920 --> 02:51:27.920
Wait what?

02:51:29.760 --> 02:51:31.760
Oh no

02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:35.120
Oh no, wait what?

02:51:35.120 --> 02:51:37.120
Oh

02:51:37.360 --> 02:51:39.360
Oh no

02:51:39.520 --> 02:51:42.160
I should have used the three of a kind sorry

02:51:44.240 --> 02:51:48.240
I messed that up. Oh, I thought maybe we could have had that. Oh, we got joker unlock

02:51:48.960 --> 02:51:51.120
Sell a total of 50 cards upgrade the

02:51:51.840 --> 02:51:54.960
Upgrade the level of the first discarded poker hand each round

02:51:55.760 --> 02:51:57.760
interesting

02:51:58.000 --> 02:51:59.120
Oh

02:51:59.120 --> 02:52:04.080
Chat didn't math I didn't math either. So the high table scammed you exactly

02:52:04.720 --> 02:52:10.720
Not discovered purchaser use this card in an unceded run to learn what it does. I like that

02:52:11.360 --> 02:52:16.320
We messed up. No, it's okay. I actually thought that was the best choice because I would have got two

02:52:17.280 --> 02:52:18.960
um

02:52:18.960 --> 02:52:25.200
Two upgrades for four of a pair and because I've been going crazy on the aces that actually would have came in quite well

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:31.200
Um, I am going to redirect into yumi plus girl

02:52:32.160 --> 02:52:34.160

02:52:39.600 --> 02:52:41.360

02:53:15.520 --> 02:53:19.360
Azura forgive me, but I need to upload all your videos

02:53:19.920 --> 02:53:26.720
Um, okay, apparently zura is coming up in three hours for anyone who is lurking in the shadows

02:53:27.040 --> 02:53:30.000
I am going to go off because I'm going to make some ASMR videos in the background

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:34.400
I'm going to upload the girls highlight reels and please do check them out when you see them drop

And we might try a lily's greed mode. I enjoy greed mode seems like not everyone enjoys it

02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:08.080
But lily's greed mode is super duper easy. She's watch me not even win a game tomorrow

02:54:08.480 --> 02:54:14.640

Um, apparently spirals play time is like

02:55:12.640 --> 02:55:18.560
Five hours straight is five hours as well. So if you want to count those as endurance, you're more than welcome to

We've got a watch long of night at the museum, which is like this comedy and it had the

There's a members ASMR stream and then there's a members video game. It's not gonna be that long the members video game. I'm just gonna

Just gonna talk about it and why I like the game. We'll play it for a little bit

02:56:47.920 --> 02:56:52.160

02:56:52.960 --> 02:56:55.840
But yeah, uh nice stacked week, uh, not many

02:56:55.840 --> 02:57:00.160
Endurances so for those of you who are perishing at the thought of an endurance stream

You're safe. Uh, and the week after follows, uh, my dad is here

02:57:06.240 --> 02:57:10.560
Um, so I'll keep you up to date with like his sleep schedule

Um, because I don't know if I'm gonna have to be like, hi guys

If you're available to come see them

Um, I think I have a new short out as well. If I'm not mistaken. Oh, uh, something went wrong

02:58:50.800 --> 02:58:54.800
Oh, I've been kicked out of my youtube account. Wow, google. Can you please relax?

02:58:55.360 --> 02:58:57.520
Holy moly. Well, good thing

02:58:57.520 --> 02:59:01.280
I don't need to be signed in in order to search if my youtube channel at least

02:59:01.680 --> 02:59:04.720
There might be a new short. Give me a second. Just type it in there

God my voice is very, uh, unique. Let's just say that there you go. I do have a new short out

02:59:29.920 --> 02:59:32.240
It's me, uh, lusting over sheeby's design

02:59:32.800 --> 02:59:36.560
Uh, because of how good it is. Uh, it's just a short little highlight. Nothing major

02:59:36.640 --> 02:59:42.000
So, you know, if you want to watch it leave a little like uh, it's literally 10 seconds and it makes all the difference

02:59:42.640 --> 02:59:47.520
Uh, the the ride never ends staroni. Rob, I'm literally what?

02:59:48.240 --> 02:59:49.440
How many?

02:59:49.440 --> 02:59:53.360
I the debt is about to be seven ASMR videos

03:00:03.760 --> 03:00:08.240
Uh, baltro. My debt is still continuing to grow. Hmm

03:00:09.760 --> 03:00:11.760
Hmm

03:00:12.960 --> 03:00:14.960
Um

03:00:15.040 --> 03:00:19.520
Wait, this is very unique. You will get there. Don't worry. Your shorts are the best. Yeah

03:00:20.480 --> 03:00:25.520
Aesthetic literally aesthetics. No one can tell. Oh she beats it. Nope

03:00:26.640 --> 03:00:28.160
Emmy's up

03:00:28.160 --> 03:00:30.000
Oh, but I see up

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.000
Azur is too up

03:00:32.400 --> 03:00:34.400
Mary up. No

03:00:35.360 --> 03:00:37.360
No

03:00:37.360 --> 03:00:39.360
No is my response

03:00:39.680 --> 03:00:41.680
No

03:00:41.920 --> 03:00:43.920
That's it. That's all you're getting at

03:00:44.800 --> 03:00:47.920
Nope, don't want to hear it. What about the gamba audio? Oh, no

03:00:48.800 --> 03:00:50.960
Uh, that's going to be a bit in the future

03:00:51.680 --> 03:00:55.280
Uh, for anyone who watched they want to start your own vtuber agency

03:00:55.600 --> 03:01:00.480
If you pause um at the scene where a reference sheet is going in the bin

03:01:00.880 --> 03:01:05.040
You can see my old reference sheet. Um, it is very true

03:01:05.120 --> 03:01:10.080
That's a little behind the scenes if you saw that chart. Um, I got reference sheets for everyone

03:01:10.080 --> 03:01:12.400
But they ended up coming out incorrect

03:01:12.560 --> 03:01:16.480
So I had to get new ones made and I ended up spending a lot of money

03:01:17.520 --> 03:01:19.040
And it was a bit of a waste

03:01:19.040 --> 03:01:23.920
But hey, you you live and you learn you I learned so much from uh doing gen one

03:01:24.480 --> 03:01:29.440
But if you pause on that chart, you can literally see my old reference sheet and the back panels

03:01:29.920 --> 03:01:31.920
I can actually show you the

03:01:33.680 --> 03:01:35.040
Okay, sorry

03:01:35.040 --> 03:01:40.160
You see the back panel ones you see, um, so you know how I have the green front panely ones

03:01:40.800 --> 03:01:42.720
The back panel ones

03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:49.120
Uh, we're actually designed to be brown to match my yukata, but uh, we ended up

03:01:49.920 --> 03:01:52.240
Um changing it because it looked a bit

03:01:53.440 --> 03:01:58.480
Uh unique on content juice. I never show this. No wonder I never show this that is outrageous

03:01:58.880 --> 03:02:00.880
Who designed that?

03:02:00.960 --> 03:02:02.960
Hey

03:02:02.960 --> 03:02:04.960
It's outrageous. I can't believe I even possible

03:02:05.840 --> 03:02:07.840
Anyway, anyway

03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:10.560
Anyway, bikini stream one

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:19.840
Yes, we'll have to find an alternative. Yes, just finished the john wick vaude. Uh, yeah an absolute shambles

03:02:19.840 --> 03:02:23.120
That's why we're gambin today, but please don't worry if you had enough of beltro

03:02:23.440 --> 03:02:28.160
Don't worry. I'm taking a pause on beltro next week. You don't have to worry. It's not coming up again

03:02:28.400 --> 03:02:35.600
Does your avatar have a backside too? No, I freaking saw those vtuber models. Sorry. I'm itch am Ible

03:02:36.080 --> 03:02:39.280
I saw those vtuber models where it does like the the butt

03:02:39.920 --> 03:02:41.680
um

03:02:41.680 --> 03:02:43.680
and

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:45.520
and what

03:02:45.520 --> 03:02:48.640
um, I wanted to get it, but I was well

03:02:49.120 --> 03:02:52.480
YouTube's already put me on a warning so I'm trying to behave as best as I can

03:02:53.440 --> 03:02:58.160
So I don't but mommies grippers. Yes, those are my grippers my french tip manicure pedicure

03:02:59.440 --> 03:03:01.040
um, I

03:03:01.040 --> 03:03:07.200
I'm going to redirect into the lovely mero who's playing project zomboid. I had no idea

03:03:07.840 --> 03:03:10.800
You want a backside of your model show off the huge dumpy?

03:03:10.880 --> 03:03:16.640
Honestly, there would be so much on show. I couldn't get away with it because the back of my design

03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:19.120
Well, I guess it's like a frilly dress

03:03:20.080 --> 03:03:22.080
But I guess it's not too bad

03:03:23.280 --> 03:03:27.360
You should think about hardcore henry for a watch along if you're into action movies

03:03:27.440 --> 03:03:33.200
But filmed entirely in first person. So if you're bad with motion sickness, no, I actually don't get motion sickness

03:03:33.840 --> 03:03:40.320
Apparently azura and mercy do I did not realize how common motion sickness in videos games were

03:03:41.040 --> 03:03:42.480
I

03:03:42.480 --> 03:03:47.280
I said, uh, this I guess this is just ignorance, but because I don't know better

03:03:47.920 --> 03:03:49.120
um

03:03:49.120 --> 03:03:52.800
I'm just like, oh, it's not a problem for me. So why would it be a problem for the masses?

03:03:53.600 --> 03:03:54.960
