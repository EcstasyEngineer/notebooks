Hey?
I'm a dreamer even though we're a kitty cat.
Cat, I'm a kitty cat.
Cat, I'm a kitty cat.
And I meow, meow, meow.
And I meow, meow, meow.
Cat, I'm a kitty cat, and I dance, dance, dance.
And I dance, dance, dance.
Cat, I'm a kitty cat.
Cat, I'm a kitty cat.
You guys remember that hit viral YouTube video where the song goes
I'm a cat, me and I'm a kitty cat
And I dance and dance and dance and dance and dance
Yeah, well I remember anyway
I don't know if it might be better for me to play games like in the middle of the screen
I feel like I'll always cover up something important over here
But then I end up getting really tiny, but then if I'm here, it's like well
At least I can show my face
I can't feel my face when I'm open
Heart or heart?
Okay, let me explain the hearts
I did a bit of, did a bit of work, yeah
Did a bit of work
So you may notice
Good morning
Good evening
Or good afternoon
I'm your host
Strony Cuttos
Let's get right into the updates
Which is hardly any, there's not that much interesting stuff
If you are a member of any viewer member, you may notice that there's hearts
What do the hearts mean?
The hearts are placeholders for where emotes are going to go
YouTube is slightly, slightly
A little bit, dare I say, a bit based
You cannot lose an emotes slot if you bagzian, okay
I'm gonna hope that bagzian is a terminology
Used by anyone else outside of Scotland
But bagzian means it is reserved, if you will
My new favourite emotes just dropped, okay
Can we keep one heart or moe?
Although I think me holding the heart and moe is better than just an emote
Bro, I can't even fucking png them
But anyway, if you are a member of any girls channel, you will notice that there's moe slots
And depending on how many hearts you see is how many slots unlocked
AC for example is the first girl to receive her batch
So hers is already up
Emmys is the next to receive her batch
There was a bit of a miscommunication error
And by miscommunication error, they just randomly didn't draw one of the emotes we requested
And drew one of the emotes we already, like redrew one of the emotes we already had
And they were like, here's your delivery
And I was like, no, no, no, no, that's not what my little sister wanted
And that has to be, I'm glad she caught it actually
I sent it to Emmys and I was like, how does it look?
Are you happy with it?
And she's like, strongy, there's an entire emote missing
And one we didn't ask for, and I'm like, you know what Emmys?
Even though you have negative 5 prescription, you've got some bloody good eyes on you sometimes for spotting
Eh, oh did you hear my caller?
Hi, hi, hello, hello
I can't go anywhere
Um, updates
There's a new AC short, there's a new short on my channel
There's a new short on Mercy's channel
Um, Azura's got 4 shorts that have been ordered
One of them is absolutely outrageous and hilarious
Um, I had to get a serial box commissioned for it
It was that funny
Um, so hopefully when that comes out, I'll send Azura's way
Cause Purser and Sheebie haven't had any shorts love
But finally, the shorts are working out and you know, people are ready to work on them
Oh Anonymous tipped me, hold on a minute, we have missed your tipped Anonymous
Give us the tip
Are you squiddin' me right now?
Thank you for giving us so many streams to share with you
Some of us are less active, but no less appreciative of how much you do
Ah, don't you worry, you bumberino, gibberino, schnibberino, woobberino
Anonymous, you don't have to fucking look
I know it's not easy to keep up with me every single day, you know
For mummies got endurance, the way we like it around here, okay?
Thank you very much for the tip, that's very kind of you
And yes, I'm glad you can enjoy the daily content
Speaking of daily content, uh...
We're still on for daily streams, that's the good news
We're having a few health issues, okay?
So currently, oh I just realized I'm linking the ACSR
We're currently having some mild issues with health
That is, I basically, I go for a nap for four hours when I finish a stream
And then four hours before a stream, I'm having a nap, I'm not having a full sleep
And I had a dream about a VTuber that I haven't even met and don't exist before
So the lines are getting crossed, I'm fucking dreaming about VTubers
That aren't even real!
I'm gonna start fighting real sh- I'm doing Shadow Boxing for real
In my head, in my head, in my head
Is it Army? Army, Army
I don't know what that song is
So I'm starting to hallucinate a wee bit
Not quite at the hallucinatory stage, however
I am really struggling to wake up for streams
But my only other alternative option
Oh is it Zombie? No, what did I say? Army
Zombie, in my head, in my head
Zombie, zombie
Anyway, whilst I'm being distracted
We're playing a game called Stray
Apparently it takes five hours to do this game
Everyone went absolutely coconuts when this game dropped
I personally have not played it before
But it's got cats in it
And you know how we do around these parts
If you didn't know, Wham and Love It
When men like creatures or lesser beings
Because it shows that man is safe
If man does not like creature or lesser being
Man is not safe
Hmm, Monca es
But apparently we get to be a yin-yor cat
As well, not just any kind of cat, a yin-yor
Five hours if you're quick
Oh no
Oh my god
Why are we so skinny?
We need to fatten us up
Where's your primordial pouch?

Why did I let them go? I'm all alone now. Hey, what do you want?
Uh, I want
To leave
This is a picture of outside. Do you want to go there meow? Well, don't bother waste the time
I'll bring you only the loneliness and despair my friends had that dream too, but now they're gone and I'm all alone
I don't know where they ended up. I tried to contact but that receiver doesn't work
My friends and I took her notes of her research about the outside here. Take mine if you really want to go there
Okay
You're on your own. I'm done with the outside. Well, wait, that's it
Momo seems very sad. He misses his friends. Let's check the notebook
The outsider manifesto. We must go outside at any cost. We must protect our brothers and sisters
We must stay away from dessert. It is saying clementime zanzibar doc and momo
That does not say zanzibar. Does it what the fuck does that say zit belt?
his are
The belt is our okay zanzibar. Honestly, isn't that bad? I'm not even going to be mad at myself
I don't like honestly, I think we should find the other notebooks. Okay, right. That's fine
Did it say a password or did it curse? We'll never know right
Hey, little cat. You're still looking for useless books, right? If I got if I got everyone's book by accident
Oh, hold on. We're streamlined. Sorry me mucking about. I actually just streamlined this. Okay. Oh, you found clementime snows
She was really brave. You know the most fearless person I ever met
Hey cat, you're still looking for the notes. No, yeah now you oh it belonged to doc
He was really a huge nerd for electronic stuff. He was was always on the verge of great discovery
No way I streamlined this. I've got all of them feels good man. That's my notebook. I was oh
Who that need
Zanzibar freaking thing. Zanzibar. Isn't that a song from
Jack Black or something?
Back home to a movie. Oh, there's a coup
Oh back home to I remember this video game it was made just after I was created. I think I can't remember it
Well the scientist and I spent a lot of time playing it. It was fun. I miss him. I can't even remember his name
You'll remember soon enough. Don't force it
And I know it's frustrating if you don't know things off the top of your head, but
What the what kind of poster is that?
Problem. Is this like troll face their version of troll face?
Ooh rack in size and one problem. No
What a bizarre little
Thank you
Uh
What lunch
Oh
I got a achievement called curiosity killed cat. Oh, no. I'm not walking in the right direction. I'm like all spun around
Stop spinning
You're gonna make mercy sick
It's just good terrible more stop. Wait. I can't get it all. Oh
Okay, that's what that's what I thought exactly
Uh, what do you do?
You
Don't do much, but that's okay. You don't have to do much translate
The city has a cylindrical shape of 450 in diameter
There is a level above ours the ceiling the city has
Seems to have a ceiling if I remember my books the big blue skies hidden behind it curious
Um, what's up here anything for me? I don't know where the last no
There's them
Right, I will come back with your stinky notepad
And as evidence that I have been here take this
You deserve it for not for hiding in plain sight from me. Okay
The symbol on the wall watches one what symbol
Okay, okay, so he's gonna point out
What one haven't I been to
I've been in that one. I've been in that one. So it's this one over here
How'd I get there
Okay getting that first
Yeah, I haven't been in that one
Sorry didn't mean to break it
Have I been in that one?
Oh no, I'm gonna have to use my head right okay go across
Zanzibar was a player we player map in helo. Oh, maybe
Challenge play the game with a bag on your head. That's not even possible the controls don't respond
Right if there's a symbol over here, did I go in this one or not? I think I took the ledge down. Yeah
Translate ventilation power supply
I need to break it
Okay, oh my god, we did it I get it
Okay, big jump be brave. Oh, you're fine. That's just a we drop. Sorry to scare you like that, buddy
Oh
Just that just a little bit of myth normally you're not really supposed to leave much of a trace behind but he will press y
Let me out
Okay, so we have a shortcut. Okay, but we need to
But
Hello, hello, hello, any oh, we got some fresh water
Speaking of water, I'm actually gonna open my bottle. Oh, no, I have a bottle of water from yesterday that is
Stop drinking we don't want you to pee everywhere
Chat we need to band together to mass spam bad cat puns. No
Shawna got me feeling something kind of way. Yeah, I like the necklace
Uh, right, there's there must be a book in here. Sorry. Wait. Whoa. What was that?
Wait, it's on top of the thing
Finally the last notebook this one seems to belong to Zanzaba
All traces of organic life has disappeared except for what we call deserves
They seem to eat almost anything that moves and breed at an inconceivable rate get it because they can see fast
Uh, it's it's as if being walked in the city wasn't hard enough. Oh
There's also a lot in this book. I said I found a design flaw in the transceiver
But I think I figured out how to fix it. Here's the equation with this. We should be able to help
Momo repair the transfer if it can communicate with the upper levels that could be our way up
Let's show him what fun. Okay, baby
Oh, there's a thing down there to remember. I see it. How'd I get there? Can I get done? I would like to remember
Member in the memory
What's this? C14
Remarkable companions have evolved so much in the early days
They're simple ai merely in
Imitated human art now. This is all on their own humans often said that making art is important in desperate situations
These are certainly desperate times
Getting his memories back
Uh, actually should I come back up again? I think so. Whoops. Oh, and I'm going further down. Oh, and I'm going further down still
Okay, let's just uh
Let's just climb up a different location. Sometimes it's a bit finicky
Right, I need to go top right
I've made an
I have made an incredible decision. We shall band together for now. We are Legion and meow
Or or is night from
What are you saying?
Why are you blue?
I have probably gone the longest way possible to get back to this guy. Sorry
Unfortunately
I don't wrong. Sorry. Sorry. It was a big jump. I shouldn't have done that to you. Oh, we need to go up
We're getting there
It's just taking me a hot second because I'm a little slow in the head
But I thank you for being patient for me reeflings
Okay, let's get up up ease. Hello. I did it. I got your quest items
Are you still looking for the notebook? Yes, that's all
That's his notebook, right? I never quite understood what he was talking about most of the time
But he was very wise. Wait, you actually found all my friends notebook
Oh, what's that? No, the transfer you were can be repaired. That's incredible. That means we should be able to communicate outside of the slum
Climbing time
Hey Johnny. Hi chat. Hi, Broly legend. Thank you for the tip
and
Climbing time doc. I'm sorry. I doubted our cause. I promise you'll find a way to reach the servers
Thank you. We might be able to find you a way up now. Let's fix this piece of junk trans receiver
The tv
Or diameter
Oh wait our friend in the programming thing said he'll fix anything. Oh, wait, he just did it come with me
Come with me
Up there see that building high above others
Yeah
If you install the transceiver at the very top of that tower, you should be able to communicate to go to the city
My friends might still be out there. If there's any way out, they'll know
There's only one small click enough to evade the zarks. We need you a little outsider. Bring us to the sky
That's kind of that lane kind of goes hard
Oh no, I need to get ready to run I think
Oh no
I don't like it already
When do they start jumping out at me? How much time do I have?
Oh no, oh no, this can't be right, okay
I can't even see where to go
I
Assume I just jump up from over there. I don't want them to grab me but we're gonna
That they're trying to get their attention
Okay
Uh, uh, uh, can I just hold a and you go up? Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Perfect
Okay, keep her going eggs bacon grits sausage
Got a flat ass, but it still takes sausage
Oh no
Oh no, oh get me up. Just get me up. Oh my god. Oh no
Oh my god, okay. Okay. What's the summer memory? Sorry. Are they chasing me?
Oh
I've got nine lines check. Yeah, the city is full of neon. It wasn't all this way
We used to be strict energy caps, especially in the slums, but people couldn't handle the concept dodging
One day someone lit up rainbow lamps neon signs all over the house that person was taken away and never seen the game
Again, but people saw hope and not long after everyone started putting lots of lights in their homes
There was nothing their pressers could do
It was the way for people to see colors again like on the outside. I think it helped
Okay, we're there progress. I don't want to go back down. Please don't make me go back down there
Is this not the way should we do we?
Oh, no, it's up. I see it
Oh, we have a little swing
Swing again on it. Oh, okay. Okay. We have swing mechanics stuff
Uh
Barrel classic rollover. Okay
But not roll off the map. Oh, no
That's why there's that metal pole there
Why is it so cold?
I knew it's drawn in with the fire. Eh, I'm playing as a cat. Okay
Is there more of those bogey things ahead? Okay, I'm holding the right trigger. So we were running
Where
Ah, oh no, there's like there's a mechanic up ahead. What is it?
What is it?
What's the mechanic? I see red. I see a code
I see it looks like I can just jump up to the left and I'll honestly
Hack the door
I'm waiting till they all come over
Hack the door
Wait, I can't lock them in though. Wait, do I need to lock them in?
I'm not very bright. Wait

Okay, and they can't jump over. Okay. I get it. I get it. I understand that was
You want to go any faster buddy? Jeez. Not like there's like
Organisms are ready. They mull your eyeballs out the socket

Okay, we did it. Oh, no, there's more. Whoa

Am I being chased? No, right. They're stuck inside
There's a barrel. Okay barrels
Hold on. Right. Okay. We can discover this memory first
Okay, Neco Neco
Neco corporate they were reason for waste management as trash from the upper levels overloaded
They tried to develop a bacteria to dissolve at all after the humans disappeared that bacteria mutated growing eaten away more than trash
And now we have drugs. Let's go
Of course, it's a corporation that caused the d- mmm. I'm not surprised. This is my kind of game. That's right preach preach
Right, so
Hold on I'm just trying to
So what open that gate they'll chase me and then grab the barrel very quickly
And roll it over
Okay, hold on hold on
Okay, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Meow. Come on chase me chase me

Dang. Oh, no, it's fine
They can't come for me because they're stuck at that wall
Oh, sorry, I heard something. Oh my god. Sorry. They made a really weird noise there and that freaked me out
Oh
What do you mean? I should play horror games. What are you talking about?
No, they fucking terrify me
Terrify like literally horror games or like donut on stuff because it just
Horrifies me so much
Okay, oh, yeah, you like that I face it maneuvers
Up up up. Oh, that wasn't much of an up, but I'll take it. Oh, okay. That wasn't up. We're fine. We're safe. Whoa. You climb up that jeez
Verically, are we safe over there?
I see a lever
I see a lift
I think I see bodies. I see little glowing things
Well
I was fine just a layer at the mold where I'm going
I was kind of kidding
I was kind of kidding. I think I need to stall out the lift coming down
Come on
There's more dropping. Wait, that's cheating
They're gonna stop me from running around. Oh wait, there is I see the lift. I see the lift
It's coming down the shaft. I am
Why is there so many jump jump?
Please please get saved. Oh my god. Go. Oh my god. We just beat their vertical leap
Oh, that's awful. That is awful. Please tell me we can unlock a gun. I'm not even kidding. Please tell me we get a gun
Oh
We need the mealmen we need the movement the mealmen
I
I really hope this cat gets a gun. I'm so sorry. There's no gun. No, I have to run away the entire time
That's terrifying
I'm so stressed
Are we safe?
Right
Right open
I demand you open how'd I get up? I go like this
First of all
Okay, there's no orange around. I think I'm safe
Here is put the transceiver on the antenna this
Uh transceiver here you go
Oh
We did it
We're lighting it up. What does it mean? I don't really know. Well, we're communicating with the higher city, I guess
Hydration check little reefling
I love the aesthetics of this game. Yeah
Activate in the elevator. Oh, maybe
Look the view is beautiful from here. I remember now the city it was meant to be a shelter. Oh
No
Looks like those look like stars, but they're only light markings
Lights marking the hermetic
Roof sealing off the city
Mankind built the shelter to protect themselves from the outside
But I came at a cost nobody can get out
The outside was a disaster completely barren unlivable and dangerous
But if you come from there, it must mean it's safe again
And my promise wasn't just to go to the outside. It was to open the city
Yeah, is that your goal
I still don't understand why some memories are coming back and others aren't but I'm certain now. This is my purpose
I have to open the city. Come on. Let's get back and find Momo now that we've connected the transmitter
We should be able to get help
Okay, okay
Not bad
This is the longest ride we're putting a lot of faith in this little cat in a bucket honestly
Cola burp emote win
Soon everyone's emotes got submitted before me
Mercy has been accepted as errors. I'm waiting to be accepted and then mine are being done last because um
I
Want the girls stuff to be done first and reeflings you guys are actually like super understanding the slums part two
No, get me out of the slums. Come on. I've been here a little too long
Oh my god, I bought these for Gimli and Vigo and
Vigo doesn't play with toys and Gimli only plays with a specific toy that they discontinued and I'm absolutely reading
Oh, no, he went
Little outsider if you're all that's such a cute nickname
Little outsider if you're reading this that means you're still alive. Excellent
I took some equipment to the bar to take advantage of their antenna. Come meet me there
I've locked the window, but the code to open it is simple. It is
Be careful it's case sensitive. See at the bar that must be the code for the window near the entrance looks cool
Okay, the bar we know where the bar is
Oh this
Oh
Okay, that was I thought amen
The code at the bar. Sorry. I get it now. Okay. Uh, let me
refresh my memory of the city really quickly
Uh, I can't remember where the bar is, but you know what we'll just make our way down
And hope we're going the right way
Uh, is that the bar? Oh, maybe no, no down little little outsider or or yinya as I call you please go down
Yeah, just like that. Yay. This is it
Hi momo
Hey little furball
Come here. I managed to get a signal. All right. Let's go buddy. Show me what you're working with. Oh, sorry
We've got a little too excited
But you show it. Oh, I'll pull up a chair. Well, I'll hold on let me get up
Hold on. Let me get up. Oh, he actually putt me off. Oh, I'm getting head cut
Let me see if I can get this thing working
Hi, mommy. This cat ears look cute. Yeah, I'm a necklace today. Oh, I've almost got it
Hello, can anyone hear me?
Hello, yes, we can hear you. We're from the slums. We're looking for a way out and wait, is that you zanzibar?
Momo
I can't believe it. I'm so happy to hear your voice zanzibar. Where are you? Are the others okay? Yes
We are safe. We found a way up
Up
Hello, do you still hear me? You have to go through the sewers to reach us. It's very dangerous
It's not because everywhere
Sewers, how? Hello
Darn it. We've lost the signal
I can't believe it. Zanzibar is alive. He and the other outsiders managed to go up through the sewers
The sewers are the most dangerous place in the slums, but if zanzibar made it there must be a way
You'll never get past the sewers. It's infested with zirks. They'll make a quick meal out of you
Especially you little one
Many tried their luck in the past and it does the end well
Anyway, I warned you. Your business is none of my business
Oh, he he gave him a warning
Mmm
Sumis his father doc used to be a great scientist who was working on some new weapon to fight the zirks
A few years ago. He went off to test the device. I love a cave back
Seamuses never in the south
up here
Not so good
Don't listen to seamus. He's just scared like I was a doc bill weapon
That's our ticket to join the outsiders
In his notebook doc mentioned a secret lab a few times that must be where he was working on it
There might be a clue in Seamuses apartment. Come on. Follow me
I'll follow you
I will follow you
Follow you wherever you
mainly
Because I'm just a kitty cat
Down in the slums without my little family
Of shot no are in is it two tail two dots
Two dots on tail. I've forgotten in the other cat. Oh, he's still cleaning it off
Bro, I think you're gonna have to get a mural down or something because uh, yeah, but you ain't cleaning up paint on concrete
Oh, is this a uh, no point in translating. I thought it was a memory. Oh knock knock
Let us in
Two dots poke a dot. Oh, that sounds right. Come on. Seamus open the door. You know, your father would have wanted to help us
Two dots poke a dot shot noir and Cali Cali Cali Caloo
Well, that was to be expected the situation is pretty tough on Seamus. He doesn't want to hear about the outsiders
He won't help me, but you I think I have an idea
Okay, what's your idea Momo?
Oh, I'm to go in are you sure here take doc's notebook and show it to Seamus
It contains a lot of information that will hopefully act as an electoral shock
Find the secret lab little outsider. Oh, that's such a cute name
I'm going back to the bar to try and re-establish communication with others. Okay. Thank you Momo
Hi Seamus
I scared him
No, no, don't shoot me away take this. What is it? Wait, this is my papa
Oh, wow, I never knew there's a secret room here in our flat, but where?
Uh, okay. Well considering there's loads of things to knock down on the wall. I'm a gobo knock all the things off the wall
They really didn't hide it did they? Okay, but what's the code? I don't see any numbers and stuff. These schematics
I
Like how to jump back every time
Oh, there's like little
What is this thing translate?
Time will tell
You will considering the humans are all parish. Yeah, time will tell actually
Actually factually as you are correct. Is it better than little seaweed? No, you don't call me little outsider
I say being all we foreigner. I'm like, oh, why are you calling me we foreigner the fuck?
That's your clue time will tell
Oh
The clocks. Okay the clocks. Okay. What time?

Two five one one. Yeah. Okay. Time will tell. Yeah. Time really did tell
Oh, I missed the animation of the door opening up. Sorry. Sorry. I didn't realize it was gonna be right there
Hello
Wow
Oh, there's bugs inside
I've never seen this room. I can't believe he managed to hide it from me all this time
These blueprints. They must be for dessert weapon. Wait, you said I didn't get a gun
Papa was always so secretive with his work. He told me the weapon was working in theory
But I needed a real life test. He went outside the slums and he never came back
That must be very sweet
The bugs
Translate
Observations cute sound, but never friendly old bacteria of human time eat all kinds of materials total
Vision in the darkness reacts to intense light and that's a different color
Um
It's just a shelf. So wait, what am I to do? I'm just a cat the fuck
What you want me to do here knock some stuff over
Don't tell me this one it's got the light next to it. That's when you know
What wait one match is supposed to do though

Maybe we can reverse it to find where he went. I can't believe my papa might still be alive
I've missed him so much. You need a weapon for the zirks, right? My papa definitely took one with him
We just need to repair the tracker so we can find him someone in the slum should be able to help come with me
I'll open the door for you. Okay
Yes, we already know because we did the guy of favor

Can hear something is it just frogs like ambience or is like is it something that's gonna there's nothing orange though
The video game wouldn't be so cruel as to not show orange if there's enemies nearby surely the game wouldn't do that
No, those are frogs
I'm actually a really good fool
Same leg it's never fully healed per thing. Oh
No
Where they need to go
Hold on
Hold on I'm about to cross a barrier where they need to go. I can't see
Just jump across the bridge and then to the right cuz it's all lit up there
Oh you turn hold on this is lit up. Oh
Use item
An energy drink. Well, it's definitely no way hmm. It's an electrical generator, but it seems to require some other part function. Okay
Okay, we're not gonna get jumped on this side, I don't think because of that generator we need to come back to it
Did we follow the cable? I think so
Okay, when the music gets intense I'll start screaming
I
Really don't want to make noise. Oh
Thank goodness it's in a cage, why is it in a cage because that baits clearly
What generate? Uh
Hello
Is this on its head? Oh, hello
Oh
Sorry, didn't mean to scare of course the scientist has like crazy cables coming over this here
Wow
Wait, you're not a zerk. Who are you? That's my badge you're wearing. How'd you find it?
Did my son send you? Oh, see miss you clever boy. You've been alone here for oh, I've been alone here for ages
I came here to test my defluxor, but it didn't go as planned. I wish I could go back home
I miss my son daily
You can have a look around the house if you want, but I have no idea how to escape this place
What do you what do you mean? Wait, you're not gonna say knows what to do remember
What do you remember little buddy? I've seen humans wear costumes like I mean similar
They were small and running around making lots of noise. Oh, they were children. Yes
The streets felt much more alive with children even with the difficulty they brought the adults seem to love them very much
Doc says he misses Seamus. Is this the same thing? Yeah, it is. Oh
No, no, he's out of beverages. Oh dear
What's going on here?
Hello radio. Oh
Why oh
I
Was this mean
But Morty you go to shove the mega seats. Oh, it does kind of oh, no
It does look a wee bit like Rick
Hey, be careful with the defluxor at fill charge it can explode zirks like
What do you mean be careful give give me it meow
This baby needs 1.21 gigawatts to work and the only thing around here that
Kind of just as a generator outside the house. The problem with that is it's not gonna start
I think a fuse blew and with all the zirks around it's too dangerous for me go and fix it
I'm not fast enough, but you might be if you reach the generator and replace the fuse
It should be able to get the defluxor recharge. Come on. Follow me. I'll show you what to do
Okay, I'm listening. Are you about to give me a weapon?
Do I need to not be absolutely terrified and shitting my panty loners? Hmm?
Cuz they just we ship my pants when it comes to these bad boys
Well, I was actually already at the generator, so I know where to go here take this fuse is brand new
Okay, thank you turning on the generator will be allowed to expect company once you fix the generator
It should be able to charge
The kick and kick start the defluxor you just need to follow this cable change the fuse and meet me back here
Best of luck. Okay, so there's gonna be a bit of a jump sequence once we start it, but that's fine. We know where to go
Surely they wouldn't spawn them in right now surely
Surely they wouldn't spawn them in right now. No, it's after I do the generator. Okay
The game is giving me a grace period. It's either I take a right or a left here
Okay, now what were they coming from I can do it
I can do it ominous red glow
Hey
Yes, give me that technology
Wait what I can't cross
Oh my god, bro, you're gonna need to aim bought this stuff. I can't get across cuz they're coming on the bridge
They need to wait until it involves the mall doc you need better aim I
Can't even get along the bridge
Think I'm okay, okay, you actually didn't do a bad job
Why would you do that game
You know that would scare me
This isn't a horror game. Why would you do that? Get me inside right now? Oh my god
Doc is beaming. Yeah, oh you celebrate is so happy hydration chair
Amazing you got the generator back on heck. Yeah, dude. You're well. Yeah
And how do you see you're welcome in French I've already forgotten
Doody and me duty and I
Yeah, my voice is unfortunately breaking at the moment
Have you seen how powerful the defluxer is it's definitely our way out here wait a minute
I might be able to mount this defluxer to your drone
Oh, that's exactly what I want to hear doc
Give me um, you know that guy that smashes like money on the table gif and basically that right now
You do not have to tell me twice. Oh
Oh, he popped
Thank you
It works the defluxer is now installed on your fancy drone
It's not meant to run off such a small amount of power if you use it too much a kid malfunction
Just remember it's dangerous. Now. Let's go back to the village. I'm coming home to my son. Oh
That's so adorable
You had I do press a
No, he's jumping on it. Wait, how do I use it?
Oh
Yeah, oh
My god, okay, it's a wee bit short. That's fine. It's better than nothing. I'ma take it. I must take it. Okay
Do you be bombs? Oh
Take out all those darks and we can get through yes
Wow, oh, sorry, I did it a bit quicker than the store. Well, it's working great
But as expected it can overheat let it cool for a bit when that happens
I hope we will last until we reach the village. Don't say that
Why don't you bring your freaking big-ass one as well? Why does it have to be down to me?
Like I'm a freaking cat. I'm literally in my head like oh
They're gonna start jumping out of those honestly. Oh
This is gonna make me so nervous
What's the dealio here
The switch doesn't work. I look like the electricity's been caught. I
See my barrels
Welcome to jump up on
Hold on let me think this
I don't really
No, not that
The pay there's not anything to jump
Reelings
The other barrel needs to go to the pay this play
It's the steam coming over

They seem to like you more than the dog
I think they go for organic matter like a preference if you will
Cuz I guess they killed all the humans. I
Hate when he walks like that. It means there's more coming
He's got murked by the zirks honestly
We've got to get jumped from behind or something I
Do not like this like I'm glad I've got a weapon, but I wish it wouldn't burn so quickly

One can for the cables yet if you've used one we're only missing one then yeah

Let's go
Hello, are you okay now?
My friend and I love talking tossing buckets at each other good clean fun or dancer neighbor disagree
So we're taking a break right now. Oh, I didn't realize they're doing it for fun. I thought they were working
The final energy drink location is on the rooftops of the slums to start head up the rooftops and find
Heptor
He's sitting on a little bucket next to a sofa
Near the robots for a chucking pain
Old man
Maybe he's up here jump
Wait

I
And then need to find that gentleman. Oh, please go up. Thank you darling
Okay, I faint him okay now that I found him hold on
From hip-tor hi hip-tor followed the little wooden ramp to the left
Look down to spot a balcony below you
The
Right the final vending machine is on the balcony, so make your way down
The ramp was immediately
Oh my god, that's so obscure
That is so obscure
Development team you should be ashamed of yourself. How is anyone supposed to find that?
At least make it possible if you're gonna do things like that
Okay, now we can buy the last memory
Shop we need the shop
Why some music go
Agreed that was painful to find I
Could not have done that I would not have been able to do that if you guys didn't tell me in spec
Well again, what do you want now? This is an ancient relic. I will cost three energy drinks one
Here you go, what is it?
Remember
The box were to help
This is an early model of a companion back then they didn't have any personality. They were just glorified autonomous cleaners
I think it's nice that the eventually mimic human is quickly missed them and in that way they kind of kept them from going extinct
They're good robots
Okay, we did it and then we'll go our last song. I don't know what it's gonna be, but let's find out. I
Don't know if we can make a song of it or if it's gonna be like hi
Oh, thank you for the music. I will practice you see
Yeah, I got the last one
Well done. Have a badge as a token of my gratitude gained an item. Let's see. What's the last please?

Thank you all done
Thank you for all that. I'm a great musician now. Yeah, thank you
Okay, we're ready to go
Uncle uncle. Merci. Okay. I think I'll finish this area now because we did what we did
All right, let me just remember the old controls for the old light
Okay, I think we just loaded into another area and that's why it did that and I'm not about to be violently chasing
by a hundred of those bills
Hello, Momo. Are you going to see your friends?
Oh, I understand
I can't believe you found docking and no with this now we can go find zons of all

What does that mean? I don't know what I mean
Oh, we're in a new location. Okay. I don't know what chapter we're on. I don't know how many there are but

Well, I can only jump on one platform. So
I'm gonna jump through the bars. Dang. I've got skills
Uh, huh gets up from over here. Don't think I don't see your devious plans video game. I can read right through you
go across up and across
And basically three more chapters to go. Oh, we steam it. We steam rolling
We jump straight
Yeah
right in front
Uh anything up here
I don't want to jump down in case it's not
Came to jump down. I know I'm about to get jumped by those xx. Sorry video games
But you make it too obvious. How do I open the gate? I'm a cat
What buttons am I supposed to mash to open? Oh, I see the lever behind the xx
Mm-hmm
Just do it
Exactly get out of here
I knew it. I knew you dastardly planned
I knew your plan. Oh, no
Oh, no, it's can be. Oh wait am I safe up here? Oh my god. Oh my god. I'm so smart
Take this. Yeah, that's right. We can do better. Mmm. You're gonna pop
That's right
I can see your video game. I know your plans. I know your development team. I've played far too many video games to be
To be outsmarted with such dukes. How do you meow? That's right. Exactly. Mm-hmm
Not one enemy in sight. I'm just
How do you even insult me? Are you gonna pick me up, please?
Please pick me up
Meow, please pick me up
Can I jump on you jump? Okay
I don't understand if I don't directly talk to you and the thing doesn't translate for me

Exploding when coming into contact with uv raises that replay
Bruh rump maxers any rump
You got them good meow. That's right. I'm supposed to be meow
Hey, what I can't even do
Are you gonna jump on me?
Don't think I don't see you. Are they gonna jump on the boat? You better not

Or is it just welcoming us into its domain? Okay, I think it's just welcoming us
Okay, let's see
Good good new york meow. That's right. Okay today. We're playing story

This is old machinery is broken now. I think we can only open it manually
We
Do you mean open it manually we're about to get jumped, you know that right?
You're just walking them all up getting that boat. Is it me about to get jumped?
I'm so even though we have protection. Oh wait. Oh no, I have to go on my own
It's the end of the ride. Oh, I need to go more. I'm sorry. He's holding it open for me
Uh, I can't go with you, but uh
I won't stop looking for a way when you find zanzibar and clementine tell them I was brave. You're relax momo. You're not dying
If anyone's dying, it's fucking me. Look at this place
Oh my god, it's not letting me run
Why would you not let me run?
Don't do such things on me
Maybe one month we won't we'll beat the peeler allegations, but this month is not that month
Thank you for the tip really legend
Why why are we peeing on main? What's going on?
Um, wait, I can't go in that. That's murky water. Wait, so what was I supposed to do here? Is really a secret?
Can I pop these?
Um, was there even anything?
Wait, no, this is the dead end. Is the water shallow and it just looks like it's not or am I going crazy?
Yeah
Uh
Were they gonna pop as I walked past I think
Remind me who started the allegations. I actually don't know
No, we must move through the stagnant pee water on a plate. Look at the menacingly looking at me
They don't know that I'm I've got a strap. I'm built carry. You know, I'm saying I'm carrying right now
No, no, no, I saw it. I can see a bend. It's a secret. It must
Yeah, you better be better be watching out for me. I'm a jumpy
I'm a murder you and I'm gonna make a little like an accident
Okay, these are active
Hold on
So like how their butts get open
Wasn't that in me with her drinking stream where chat blackmailed her into recording that is that where it starts?
Oh
My my little sister isn't so innocent anymore. She can
Okay
I didn't mean to activate another one but fine. It's fine
Try not to overheat it too much
I can do it like that and just kind of see someone as they come
I
Think emmy is more likely to do it and she be no different not that one
I know it was just sort of a throwaway line, but I can't get an idea of strongy pheromone max and out of my head
Oh, it's because I'm fucking minion. Sorry, but I'm like an absolute like knee. I'm not being funny
Like I didn't go outside if I don't need to go outside. I don't like
I kind of discussed I don't even know if I should talk about it. You guys will be like so disgusted by it
but like
I don't even wear deodorant because I'm gonna go outside so it's like why it was the point of being deodorant
Um
But I hope my dad's not mad at me when he sees me
He's gonna be like strongy. You're like shit and I'm like, yeah
Oh, come on literally one
I
Hope one of the upcoming emotes is sniff. I mean if you want
Uh, I've got more than 10 like emotes slots
Unlock how many heart mojis are there like what's the highest number it goes up to because that's how many emotes slots are unlocked
But I'm not nice. There's so many
15 okay, so I'm getting a batch of 10 and then I get an extra five and then if I make more then
You know
Yeah, I know I'm definitely open to that
God this place is like
Well, there is this how you're supposed to tackle these areas just this feels like cleaning simulator now a little bit just kind of like
Oh, oh that guy popped in with
The hunger for the cat flash is okay the last couple of years from brothel everyone
It's not even that I tried to be mingin or anything, but I just I'm mingin
Like when I'm like when I say see is like, oh, I've not showered in a few days or whatever. I'm like, it's not a
Teehee. I'm so gross and nasty. It's like no, I ain't showered rough a fucking reek
I got be all out of the wazoo
I've got greasy hair out of the wazoo
That's a little it
Yeah, if you don't sweat it's pretty okay
Oh, no, I'm ready. Sorry, but I'm actually ready for you guys. I'm not being serious
I
I'm so ready. I'm not scared anymore. I can hardly see anything by the way. I don't know why there's like a duff freaking
Filler and of course it goes away the moment I complain about it because why wouldn't it?
Okay, let's just let's just go next
Yeah, that's right. You can't scare me now
You can maybe jump scare me around a corner, but that's about it
I
Whoa
Where are the eyes?
Hold on. Hold on. This seems like a bit much. I don't think the torch can handle all of this
There's no way I'm supposed to be being seen in Dungeon Mad down here
Oh
Oh the game's lagging because it's loading a new area, right that's manageable
Wow
I
Stony really gets stinky if I am I'm literally turning us all into Napoleon dynamite
Can I go through here?
I'm coming back in three days don't want
God it really does not oh the eyes are asleep on the wall
I can't do anything to the eyes. Hmm
I have to wash my hair every other day, but we don't seem to wash it off
Oh, I used to have really greasy hair
And I would have to wash it every day like I'd wake up and it'd be fecking greasy and smooth
But ever since I've been using lush shampoo bars, I actually get like a couple of days with it
And which is really nice
Um, so I can't recommend lush shampoo bars enough to be honest
So if you're ever if you've got the money to treat yourself, it is a bit more expensive, but like
As far as I'm aware they they pay their employees a bit more decently
Or probably publicity stunt. I have yet again fallen for you know, have you?
Um
Oh
No, do not tap it. Okay. Sorry. I'll just test them because I keep overheating the poor guy, but
Just the should men use it. Yep. It's just a generic shampoo bar. It's called jumping juniper on the lush website
It is literally, um, you put it on your head as you're in the shower or in the bath
And it lathers up and then that's you dunzel. Um, open the door though
Oh hacker man, we're in
Oh, we've done it now
What the
Oh
Is he gonna send an up? Okay. Yeah, he doesn't like it. I don't like it either
Oh my god, they just send more what the
break
Bruh, bruh, no, no, no, that's outrageous. Sorry. That's outrageous. Yeah, no wonder I'm fucking dead. What the fuck was that?
I
Saw is that was outrageous
And it reloaded all of those freaking egg sacs that are in my way, so I need to destroy them all so I can get a clear
And I'm gonna overheat again
I
Huh, right, so what I need to do I need to be able to wait. I can't even run across there super easily
I have to go down here and do a u-turn
That's ridiculous
If you're gonna give me a battery that like
I
At least make it last that's all I'm asking seriously
If you're gonna give a weapon to defend yourself, then you make like some fucking stupid ass
map like that
I'm sure there's probably some tactics I've not figured out yet, but that was really annoying
That was like, okay. Yeah, just keep sending it. Okay, great. Thanks
All right, let's hopefully we don't mess up this time. I'll start on this end because why not and what difference does it make?
He's already awake
Hold on. Sorry, I'm tryharding. I'm actually tryharding
I'm actually fucking tryharding and a fucking cat game. Please open the bloody thing
Wait, I could just use these barrels and jump across and I've been done
I was those barrels not available
Go right. You don't have to tell me twice to get the heck out. Oh for
What and the F
Hey, I'm feeling a bit intimidated as well. I ain't gonna lie
We are being perceived
I
Uh, oh, please don't cut to me. Please don't cut to me. Oh, I cut to me and cut to me
Oh
I cut to me. Why did you cut? Why can't I not just have been a cute little cutscene?
Well, I've been to if it was just an adorable little cutscene of how fast I can run and I didn't have to do this section
Oh, wouldn't that be adorable? Oh, that'd be so kawaii-ne, kawaii-ne, kawaii-ne, kawaii-ne, so kawaii-ne
Kawaii, kawaii, kawaii, kawaii, kawaii, kawaii, kawaii
Oh
I'm literally just spam and be an anticipation of them launching onto my room and butt crack
Please
Please don't make me frickin go back. Don't make me do that again. Oh god
That was awful. Can we get an upgrade on the duration of this little bad boy, please?
Wake up. Don't leave me alone. Please. I'm too scared to play this game alone now that I have you
Literally be 12 more like be reflin get it?
It was dark. I was alone. I felt like I was back in the network, but you saved me
Thank you friend. Enjoying that much power was rough on my core. The defluxer is completely
I was just praising this game for freaking not having to run away
I'm stressed. I thought this was supposed to be a cute cat game and I'm so stressed
Wait, you didn't hack it. Oh, you did hack it. Hold on. Oh, let's go before the fan goes on
Right, so we are
It's a flying refling. Yeah, you're literally gated me through the game. Yeah, yucky toxic
Okay, we can't say remember we can't say we can't say

Cryopods he uploaded himself into the computer and then everything was different
The
Bots aren't bots at all. They're humans
But the upload something went wrong. He was stuck for hundreds of years until a little cat appeared you

That's a unique tea tree top. Maybe we don't need a farm roof lens. Maybe we just need a tree top
And we can all have different levels and stuff. Although I might get a bit chilly. So I think we'd I think maybe the farm would keep us warm
I think a tree top open like this would be too cold
What else have I forgotten?
I must have had parents friends. What happened to everyone? I wanted to open the city
But is there anyone else left to save? Oh, don't doubt your mission now soldier. Oh wait, we need to find this, sorry

I'm sorry for shutting down earlier. I'm human probably the last in the world
Now look what's left of me so much has come back to me. How much have I forgotten?
Maybe if we find clementime, we can restore my memories and get you back home at the same time
We can go back down and find out more from the companions or head onwards

Yeah, that's probably really rough waking up and being like all your families pop off

Oh, no, it's a puzzle
Turn on
Wait, what? Oh no, I actually have to do a puzzle. Oh jump over here. Okay
Okay
Oh, there's another one. Okay, okay, okay
How do I turn it on? Oh, I sorry. I meant how did I get out right?
Okay, so come yeah, and then you come on this one
And then you stop
And then you come with me
And then you'll lift up the barrel with your weight
And then I can roll the barrel over the fumatic tube type thing
Yeah, and then that's all three done. You know for a cat. I'm awfully smart to even have this perception
Stony move hiding in a box
The part we need can I just take it? Okay, I was gonna say um
Oh
Production line stopped
We're taking down the high table
We've got it quick. Let's go here through the centre of the shop. We've got this battery back to clementine
Is this about to be a run sequence?
Oh, no, we're fine. Oh
Oh, that's a smooth criminal
You've been hit there. Hey, you've been struck there
A smooth criminal
Where the heck is clementine
Uh in the apartment complex which it wasn't down here was it?
Or was it I spoke to someone around here. Yes
I need the beatboxer guy like the three guys at the apartment
Not there
Where wait
It's done there
Do you think the criminals eyeing my collection of vintage cars?
I don't know what happens
Nothing makes sense if we can't done
We're locked off right we're gonna have to go an alternative route
I assume is what this is pointing to
We're taking down the high-bot table. Honestly who would have thought the cat would finish through a John Wick started
I need to like climb off. Yeah
What is so neon
My little gamer eyes can't handle it right now
I really be oh remember, okay
This spot is nice what I wouldn't give to actually feel the softness of the pillows or the taste of a cold drink
This drone is useful, but I miss having my own body. I miss feeling. I miss
Hurting I miss being hungry. I know this isn't helping, but what if we stayed just a little longer? Thanks for listening. I'm ready now
Oh little buddy. It's okay
Is this gonna put me down it is
Hmm
I don't know how to get into this apartment complex. It's been cut off by the polis
To see police. I it's actually Gaelic
and Scott Slang
Polis is the same
Yeah, I'm just getting further away from the complex
Unless I'm to go up here. Hold on wait, maybe I was on the right track
Looks like I can climb up here question mark
Not
Unless
I'm getting very turned around. I'm pretty sure the apartment complex is like eight miles that way. Let me in
Let me in
Let me in
I don't know what the downstairs neighbors are up to but keep hearing bugs on hammers
Okay, that's definitely the one I'm supposed to know
Can we go anywhere?
No
Can I go up on that?
No
Right, right. I'm in the wrong direction. Hold on. Let's recalibrate our headings
And if we can go down actually because I'm going the wrong way
I'll need to check out what the police are doing. I'll talk to all the people at the police the policemen
police
Oh
My god
Uh, right you talk with
Hey, you think you can stop us from handling hanging an hour and six
All this work for nothing. What happened?
I'm like looking for routes or anything but I'm being prepared
So does any reeflings know where I'm supposed to go?
There's bars I didn't there's no point in being inside it
I want to say I have to take a right because honestly the game was designed for me to take a right
Hold on or maybe I can like go in here. No, I can't
You're awesome. There you go. It's hard to figure out like what the game wants you to do when you're
Then you know where to go
So because like obviously we can't really use the light theory right now. I was like, oh the light will guide you
Really the thing's pointing them where I'm supposed to go
Danger
I don't believe I want to see it
Light theory isn't working right now
And none of those people are talking to me
The meow will gauge you okay, hold on
Yeah, I can't talk to you. I'll talk to the people in the bar. Maybe they'll tell me what's up. Hey, can you tell me where to go?
I've mastered every game that ever existed but can't figure out how this one am I not seeing the whole picture here
What game snooker
You need the you need the chalk is that what you need the snooker chalk
She's overthinking it so hard wait barriers
Oh for fuck's sake
Oh, there's sentinels hold on
Okay
Okay, what does it do?
Of course, of course the tiny cat can slip under I'm sorry
That makes perfect sense and I'll honestly
I
Just like I need I forget I need to remember like I'm tiny and small and adorably cute
You don't move right
Do you look away
You do
What about you I saw you I think I've got time. I've not got time. That's not where I'm supposed to go
Not here hold on have to use my brain hold on
Ready, where do you go?
Okay, it's giving jump giving jump
Not really a jump is it uh, how'd I go out? Oh
You move
You don't move okay, that's fine
Oh
Okay, we made it
That was a some stealth app that meant this game is actually really fair in its gameplay other than oh no, she's like what hello
Is she up there
She must be up there
Or she left me a note being like I've popped my clogs
Uh
Am I going crazy did I not just she left me a note
Look at clue. Oh god, she's hiding somewhere
Uh claim
No sign of claim here. Okay. Oh, what's that? It looks like some kind of a coded message
We're gonna have to play detective to figure out what happened to her. Look for b12 in the cat the answer lies in my stuff
And then there's four symbols
What okay, one's a lava lamp. I know that's upstairs the rock is upstairs as well
Wait that level lamps right there
I
Not that level lamp
Right the level lamp up here and spit is that we think
There's also a hidden message under the container it says I'm with okay
And then there was a level lamp up here. Okay. Okay. And then a level lamp up here
I was level up right there
Maybe not this level lamp in particular. Okay inspect
We need a belly last a huge huge huge laugh. Yes, they're coming
Um, this gem is a medium value in low purity. The glow seems to have been added artificially
Maybe it's the axis of beacon for us to find something useful bingo. Is it says blazer?
Okay, am I going crazy, but strongly seems tamer. Uh, I am
I am non-functioning sleep at the moment
I basically sleep for four hours after stream and then I sleep before our four hours before stream
Like I've not had a full sleep in a couple of weeks now, so I wouldn't be surprised if I sound not myself
So don't be scared
I can't believe it. My hyper reachable isn't hyper
Wait, where's the note? I can't I can't remember the other two objects. I'm supposed to find
No clue here. No, I know I'd what wait, what's the piece of paper?
Um a cone a cone
Inspect why not?
That's all right, right. You find something you don't say into the nature. I'm just clicking exit stuff. I'm gonna be honest
Oh, I heard the noise you bleep
You're bleeping at something I don't know what it's in this area
Sure
I don't want nothing to have an apartment. It's the way the companion see the humans. That's kind of funny. Oh wait the the cone
Like something it says come to someone. Okay. Oh
Right and then one last item which
What is number one a plant?
Is it in the kitchen?
Oh, you're worrying about your sleeping health. I don't know what to do
I honestly don't oh we love her. Um
I'm a bit
Mucked up
That's not a warren can
Yeah, it's definitely a warren. Yeah
I don't really know what to do because I basically pass out after stream, but I don't go full for a full eight hour sleep
So the only option I have really is to
um
drug myself up to force myself to sleep, but
I've done it a few times now and I keep waking up completely messed up and I don't do the full eight hour sleep
I
Can consume cannabis is it a plant? She's one. I think it's a plant. I don't know what plant though
She's wanting me to look at
Right you got so many plants in this apartment you can down
We'll go let me check one more time with the item looks like
What even is that?
A seriously is there a plant up here that looks like that?
I
Don't know what the item is
Well, that doesn't sound sustainable. Yeah, the space you're right yourself. Just sleep normally. I can't know that's the problem
I pass out four hours before stream
And I pass out four like four hours after I've already inspected you right the heck is this bizarre item
It's not in the kitchen is it?
Is up here maybe on the shelf
But it's a nice level lamp though. I have no idea what this is like was misread and sorry
I was also writing this message. It reads nightclub. Oh
What
Show me the image. No, it's gone. What?
It looked nothing like that
Nothing like I don't know what that was
Um, you sleep four hours and four hours just sleep eight hours straight and you're fine. No, the problem is I wake up
I don't want to get in trouble
I I can't sleep for eight hours is the problem
I could do the only time I get a deep sleep is right before stream and
Uh, obviously I have to wake up for stream
so I don't have like any
Solution to my problem
Because I need to be meman
I
Wait, how did I get over here?
Um, like obviously it's probably like oh just skip the nap. What? How did I get here? I don't
Oh, it must have been the wall
Take a day of rest without streaming. No, this sounds terrible. I know for a fact
I'll be so mad at myself for not streaming
That I would be so upset that I wouldn't actually sleep
And then that would annoy me twice as much
Um, that would send me into a fit of rage
Right, how did I get here? Was it you?
Whoa
Okay, he's patrolling. It's fine
Uh, are you sleeping then waking up looking at your phone? No, um, I spoke to my doctor about it
Um, actually a while ago now, um, and um
I don't like bring my phone into the bedroom. That's like a big no-no
I'm allowed to rot in bed like on tiktok or whatever, but I don't bring my uh phone into the
Bedroom because uh
it mentalates
The nightclub the nightclub all the bones through that was freaking hating on me. Yeah. Well now it's my turn
um
I'm the police is explaining that cat freaking stole it. Yo, let me in
It's not for you. We'll wait. Yes
A brave I don't take braves. What is that anyway?
Sorry, sorry, I'm not supposed to do that
I don't think the bouncer's gonna listen. Hey guys, I think we're gonna have to claim at the back
This
I do have maybe you could have some days with a gorilla stream instead
um
Oh, that's the window I can go inside
Are they talking? How did I get across to you?
As long as long term if you collapse with burner and I don't get burner like that I just get like can't sleep
Oh my god, you're so happy. Can I talk to you?
Oh, that's a shame. I can't talk to him. Oh as long as you're happy doing your thing
Hi, mr. Can I come inside?
Hey, how'd you get up here? You want to party with us here jump in and get a drink? Oh, yeah, come on buddy
Livian
Alex was the name of that mpc. I've just shot one of the person listening in right now
Whoa
What's this
Wow, I'm getting blinded. We're just climbing time. Is there like a hidden bit?
I've never been to like a rave or a party is this what it's like
Oh
Hey, wait, there must be like a private room that claims them like back here. Maybe
Clam wouldn't be in the middle of the floor, right? Surely not. She's literally a bit
Just sleep well on stream I far in my sleep. I honestly would if I could buy freaking far. Where the frick is claim? Am I going crazy?
Hey
Who is it blaze or someone or Blake?
I'm gonna say where is she you like my mask. I made it the jam the scent on the scans and it looks cool
You're a very shy dancer
Who wants to talk to hi
The access some private business going on it has been reserved for some blazer guy. Yeah, where is it?
Up
Up up
Uh, ask a new shop receipt. Wait, no, I'm still on site wait. I'm trapped wait come down. No down
Take it up
Hold on analyzing analyzing scanning location visualizing
Oh
Where there's wall here
God I suck at this
That looks like a walkway I'm supposed to get all the way around
How do I get up to it?
You see that you don't get rated on your birds
Once you open the floodgate with a farce it's over
You can never unfar again on stream
Wait, maybe that was the right way to go
Oh, it's it. There's not glass. I thought there was glass. Okay. Wait, so how'd I go up?
Okay, this has to be it
Um
So
Well, I uh, I think my dad's gonna keep me awake so I don't nap after stream basically because you'll be wanting to like go
And do stuff where the I'm genuinely stuck though
Can I like climb this wall with my claws or something?
I'm really turned around in this location. I see I see ladders, but
Oh for goodness
Use a lever do you guys have a lever here?
This is why so I can like interact with it
Hey everyone DJ Matty here, let's get the party started. Of course someone's been requested by a very questionable friend blazer
I need a record
Oh for goodness sake was it that simple?
Oh
Okay, it was that simple I'm so sorry
In my defense, I'm not smart
Wait
I need to do it on that side and I need a lever for it
There's nothing up here
Oh take the thing okay when the other guy goes what take his record
Okay, okay, okay
Surely that's what I'm supposed to do. I don't know why I'm supposed to do that
I
Right, I need to wait until he's not doing it and then yonkers record
He squashed him
Terrible
Can you snatch the plate? That's what I thought but
He's not coming over
This guy needs to come over and so I can steal the plate I think
You probably have to do that on both sides to take it. This doesn't even have a lever right? I need to find a lever then
Oh, where do I find a lever? Do you have a lever for me?
No
Whoa
What how is anyone supposed to know?
Okay, remember
Oh, there's no progress down here. It's just a memory thing
When I was human my friends and I would gather and party long into the night
Even if we had to suffer the annoying consequences the next day
It felt good to find joy despite the unaliveable surface and of a ruddery and the underground living conditions became more and more
squalid
And the capitalist greed of the companies like
And the police state created by the sentinels now I remember why we're doing that
Oh
Okay, so there's nothing
Wait
Let me in the vip right now. I'm on the other side of the door. Let me in
When I was human
Yeah
Everyone's been turned in my theory is that everyone's a human entire robot
But they forgot or maybe it was taken away by the state
So the people wouldn't revolt and accept that the surface isn't livable
Because obviously everyone's a robot now. So of course the surface is livable
Down with black rock. No, no, no, no, no the sentence is the high table
Down with the high table
Tin foil man, right where the thick is this lever take strange drink
I'm too alcohol someone
Why would I take a strange drink who would want a strange drink?
You
Who would want a strange drink the wink
Am I getting you drunk
I
Want to see you destroy that dance floor
Who wants a strange drink? Do you want a strange drink?
This club sucks when I tried to get that stupid VIP room. Can you believe it? I just stole this lever
If you give me a drink, I'll give you this off
Oh, thanks. Here you go as prom. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, give me that
Okay, we got there in the end
Doing it backwards as always
Okay, and then jump up on top of this one and then we can get away with it
Yeah, it wraps around
Oh, wait, should I do that music thing? Okay, hold on. Let me do the music
I think it must be achievement like make the club silent is my guess
No
Oh, wow. No, um, uh, I must be a I should have picked up a record somewhere
Yeah, well, okay. All right. Sorry. Sorry wasting time
Stranny is the master of solving puzzles backwards literally they're picking up all the random stuff being like
What?
I'm wondering if I'm supposed to bring in a second record and it like enhances and like everyone dances a bit more I guess
Is my gander at what is supposed to occur here? Please put me upstairs
Did he really just pose for us
Okay, what's going on here?
Oh light control let there be lights
Oh, no
Make that stuff low
Hello, can you lower?
No, no, no the other way the other way lower
And then this one
I'm in lower. No, you're getting higher
And then lower. Oh, wait. No, that's a jump across. I jump across now
Oh
Uh, I have to admit I did take a lot of time to get there. So I'm not even surprised. He's not just being chilling
I'm waiting for me
Hi, buddy
Hi
Are you just being teeny here?
Hi
I have a very good relationship with the sentinels. I don't understand why people complain so
You're the first that would be taken down
For your k your cranes you have committed against the community
I shouldn't have spoken to that man at all
Two birds with one stone, you're not as clever as you look little cat. Anyway, not in personal business as business
How do I blow him up?
We need Guy Fox's stuff right now
Business is money and I value money way more than our friendship or camaraderie. They are all yours

I just got a freaking laser beam
I've got an achievement all cat razz go to jail. I'm in jail. I got the jail the polis got me

Okay, rather confusing but I got the I didn't realize we were going down
Oh my god, they're torturing him
Uh, I need to get refland and get the heck out of here because what the heck can I claim?
Must be a claim and location is just jail
Look at the jail
Oh, I want you back now. I hate playing the game alone
You are ironically giving me so much courage to play
How do I get past you? You don't move. I don't get past you at all
I

Oh, wait, hold on. There's something here. Sorry

I can't believe it. You're a good friend. Heck. Yeah. I'm a good friend
I'm so glad that we're all safe together again, but we're not safe yet. We need to find a way out of here
Can you open that door?
Wow

Let's get the heck out of this jail. I see a lever
sugar
Could I get in there or can I just jump up? No, I can't all right, let's go to last uh
Hold on the main biscuit uh, uh, hold on

Neither can I
This has got glass. You need to break it for me. I need to go up

Can you give me a lift up?
I can't reach you'll have to lift me please. Yes. Yes. Yes. Just like that
I'll be a second hang in there
Uh, okay, it's just a lever. There's nothing scary here
Climb spray base we're not, uh, leaving him behind
B12 gang
And I'm getting every comfort in my chair
The sentinels are broken the way again. They will spot me instantly
Maybe you can try and bait them into those cells and lock them. Oh, no
What do you mean bait them into the cells?
Only see one
Just him you want
Just one
I didn't know they freaking show at me. Holy crap close it close it
What's around? Oh my gosh
That really went for me. Are you okay?
Are you tall?
Wait claims you can't talk all
We're cat gaming today we pooding any putters you're my little pooders
One second
This per fellow seems like sentinels are ruthless when it comes to defying them
That's what I feared they have completely erased him no more emotions no more self-awareness no more memories
Please let's not get caught. No we won't
All right, what's the deal climb?
I need a lock of them inside here
Would it be better
I need to attract them both
I'm gonna lock it behind me
Wait, I'm an idiot. Oh sugar only one came in that's not what we want
Is it gonna push against the other door if it pushes against the other door
No
It patrols inside the dang cell
Unfortunate I messed that sequence up. Um
Right, okay, let it out and then do a little
Wait, was that registering it was inside? Whoa
One shot
Seriously
One shot
I fucking give me a fighting chance
I was gonna praise this game, but I kind of be honest with one shot death type stuff. That's ridiculous
Literally one shot. I mean I get there has to be like an anti like oh this game this game
It needs to have like it can't just be like super duper easy and all that but one freaking shot
Like me
I'm freaking gonna say I don't know if I did that in time
Again
So how do I get you in?
Yeah, don't shoot me again, I guess
And come inside I guess uh, this is not gonna work
I did it work
Oh, thank god. Yeah, the game was nice. That should not have worked, but whatever. I'll take that
You're a house cat. You're not built for durability. I know I'm a tiny cat, but brav. Give me a something to breathe like a lamb
Hi, you want to come escape?
Oh no, they took their brains
I
Juked him like a pro honestly, I was like, bro. I'm dying again. I'm gonna start region. Okay. Maybe I take it back
I was a bit heasty. Okay. I was a bit heasty
um
It's fine. I was just a little mad. I'm guessing we can't progress until I
Yeah
What are we looking at? All right out you come claim
Cat versus laser the cat should win it. Yeah, I should have infinite health infinite a ammo
This door it's only way out this jail. I think I can open it from that control room
We have to find a way to get access to that room though. Please look around
Hmm
There's parkour
Oh my god, what if the game just let me super easy just have a parkour moment with no enemies that chase me
Wouldn't that be awesome? That'd be amazing. Wouldn't you love oh keys?
No keys
They left the keys in the door hop on the back of the truck you should be able to jump over the fence
Oh, right. Okay
That's what I'm saying. I keep accidentally doing the puzzles. I'm like, oh cool keys. What do I do with it?
I was gonna like take the keys over and games like all right next great jump on back. Okay. I'm on the back
Whoa, whoa, whoa beep beep
That's what I saw a woman driver
Those poor saps are facing a fate worse than death. Mmm
Would you rather perish or would you like?
Rather like lose your mind but still be alive, but you're not all there
Oh
Please no run sequence
My heart can't handle it. I really can't wait. Please drive it. Please drive us in the car
Please oh my god, was that my freaking voice that did that noise? Did you hear that? It was like a piercing noise. Oh, I'm stuck
I'm stuck. I'm stuck climb climb climb
Wait climb you're not gonna pick me up
Hello meow
You forget about me bish. Yeah
I can get that I literally couldn't get that
Oh, we got like an actual cutscene
Oh
All right, come on, let's go buddy
You're not coming
Okay, there's no way we'll we'll make it out of the sentinels on our tail
I can distract them for a little but you have to go the outsider manifesto says we must go outside at any cost
I wrote that
Oh, that's so
You're one of us now. It's not that everyone has to get the outside
But one of us has to you've gained an item subway key now go. I'll keep you in my ram little outsider
Climb run yes drive away
That's so funny
Okay, come on you and your mechanic mess up now
Oh, our friend was here. Oh, no the hippies gone
And
Now that is a death
Flag if I've ever seen one
I fear you might be correct my dear rifling. I fear you might be correct indeed
Okay, we've got a subway key now. We're unironically about to drive a train
We don't put it in this box
No
Sorry one moment
Is it this side we drive? No
Um
I'm sure we got given a subway key
If the death is not on the screen, it doesn't count exactly John Wick 4 momentum
I read an interview by Keanu Reeves because I was so upset
And if he apparently begged the directors to make it obvious he had perished
and I was like
Because he didn't want any of our arbitrary ending
Um
So I guess the scene of him falling down the stairs was it
I think I'm maybe going back
Or not at all
Boo oh neko like no eco not neko
We're actually going to be a train conductor stop. I'm pretty sure there's a train conductor neko in some
touristic railway station in japan
The music's gone all funky. I like your funky beat logo
Uh, but he's coming back for John Wick 5. Yeah
Oh
Train conductor for gen 2 confirmed
Can I make a sec?
Show me you take it
Here's that paper
We already have a train conductor in gen
Is that an ac joke omega alone?
The control room the headquarters you say
Do you have a ticket to this
Just stick people love tree what type of train would I design?
The steam train the scottish stream
The steam train
Well this place hasn't been touched by time
Hello

Hello
Oh
They don't have personalities that on the surface enjoy the world's safest city waltz city 99
There's no robots
Uh
Waltz city 99
Things are out of order though. There's no humans here
But the robots haven't evolved
City sealed rules of confinement heavy prison sentence
City sealed
Wow
Greetings inhabitant of waltz city 99 the door leading to the surface is currently locked due to a confinement procedure
Please refer to any certified engineer inside the control room if you have any requests. Have a nice day
It's weird when they don't have a personality
They're just
Robots
Okay
Wow, this is weird
The control room is closed by some sort of security protocol
It says that only humans are authorized also says that i'm not considered human. Hey, that's offensive security protocol
Maybe if we work together we can open this passage way
Um the control
It says why
I'm pressing why but it's not doing it. I need to drag something over. Oh, yes. Yeah, I do. I remember this
Let's stand on it and see what we can do about this panel
Um, can we expect some gender bender and models females? No, I'm not like this
Oh
Okay
Yes, good little spreadsheet. Whoa
Oh, it's like
I can't scratch it off or open
Hmm
I need to throw something at it
Yeah, there's no gender bender of concepts that are already pre-established like
All the designs that have been approved so far like unique concepts. How do I open that panel?
Yeah, can I borrow your tool, please?
The savings you'll please refer to any certified engineer. Have a nice day. Thank you
Do you have a tool that I can borrow?
We started down there that was midtown and there we're up here
And
John makes and create with her coffee right
No, I was very surprised about the new gen two entry. Um, it completely knocked out a previous except the design
So that was a very I was very surprised. Um, because I had actually enjoyed the
Open human
I'm not sure what I'm missing
Oh, you know what you're actually done
Oh, yeah, that's right. A little cheeky like cold
Is it sabotaging?
Okay, this is my
Does I need to bring the thing over again? No, it's open
I
Chant to go to eat us through the high table. Oh, you've guessed the pot. How do you this is the control room for the entire city
They controlled everything from here and it's empty
I remember hating them so much. They had everything clean space limitless power freedom to move
Little good. It did them
The plague I remember now
Everyone was dying and they thought they were above it all they did nothing to help us
I watched my family die. I felt helpless. I couldn't do anything to save them
But I can still help you we can still go outside together
I will carry the memories of humanity and the people I loved
Oh
I think we did it anyway, I don't know. This seems pretty end gamey to me not to be dramatic or anything, but I think
That's it. That's the main computer
I
According to the mainframe no one has been here for years
The whole city is stuck in a lockdown cycle from long ago if we disable it
We should be able to leave we'll need to bring the rest of the systems online
These computer holds the data we need we need to turn them on
While you do that, I'll look for passwords and encrypted keys to get into that system got it
Yeah, understood
Okay, turn these on
I actually really like areas that don't have freaking anything. Oh
That's me turning it on by walking on the keyboard
Oh, I can turn the phone. Hell yeah
Oh, let me jump that
Okay
Let's go. Oh, I missed. Sorry. Hold on one moment, please
And then done
It worked good job my friend. I found it. I know how to open the city something's off here
Wait, maybe there's a way around it
Roof control stage
There that's the workstation to open the city, but there's several layers of security preventing us from using it
Okay, that's understandable
Now we need to do what we do best me. I'll hack the machines and you destroy some stuff. Yeah
Oh, we actually destroyed the high table
Oh, so you're hacking what am I doing?
This isn't destroying
Okay, hold on there's a symbol here
Oh
Get this off
Okay, I will do my job do gel. Yeah, take this high table. Okay, this one
In this room
Um
Oh, there's a second one. What are you? Why are you like?
Am I supposed to go up? Oh, the circus
Okay, and then last but certainly not least
This one right here, which is connected to this
Open it up and then say this
Oh, it's so cute. Yeah, fuck it up. All that practice
Did I do it?
Hack, okay, okay, I understand
Did you take HP damage? Ouch
It's not what it looks like
It's not what it looks like. Oh no, we've got to keep going. Okay. It's not what it looks like
It's not what it looks like. We're totally not doing a hack. Please quick faster faster faster
Wow, he's taking HP damage, but it's okay. Oh
I
Can recharge once yes, yes recharge will recharge you please quick before we get stopped
Quick quick quick quick
Wow
Okay, we're picking up get on my back. I think this no, no, it's not it's not
Just kind of make the workstation. We can disable alarm. Yeah
We literally can heal you you're literally a robot. I have terrible news. You're literally a circuit board. We can heal you
Rift control right go do your thing
Oh wait, there's
That's it. We're safe
Listen I have something to tell you I knew the power requires to disable the city
Control center would be immense more than the strong body could handle but never the security disabled
I can take control of the system and open the city overriding it would destroy my software
Um, I'm pretty sure the software is him
By made that choice when I hooked into the first computer
Is he gonna die I can't cry
I don't want to cry wait no
And the consequences it could bring
I'm sorry. We won't see that. It's like no
I thought I needed to carry on in the memories of humanity to hold on to the past but I
Can see a future in the companion than you here. Let me take that off
You are my friend my very bad. Oh, no, why why do they have to make it sad?
It's literally I gave him a freaking car
Mine is thank you. No, I don't want the conversation
No, it's literally I gave him a fucking car
Why does everything have to be so sad?
No, please
Don't make a sweet body roll on the floor
No
I thought it was a game about being a wika
What the heck
No, we're curling up for a rest next time
Away
Oh my god
No, like literally so it's plug them back in he just needs a wee bit of a more GPU come on a GPU is just a rock
We tricked into thinking it's literally harvested from the air
Oh
Why
Oh
I don't feel better seeing everyone
Do you even see the surface to make it worth it? No, don't put me back here
Can at least take them with me
Yeah, no, don't no, no, don't sit down. Can I not take them with me?
Are you joking I can't even take them with me. Why not?
I
Bro
When the hero never gets the good ending honestly
The city is actually open you can freely get in and get out
Why does it say like that this city is actually open? There's an old way to freeze it
Oh
Oh, I'm gonna see my buddies at least
Now there's pigeons and shit I can eat
And my friends here I'm calling for them
Oh
Wait, was that him
Was he uploaded into the mainframe was that him at the left?
Was that him
Despite that you're still just the cat
I don't like when you cry I fucking can't stand why do the games have to be so mean?
Why can't it just always be a happy ending? I mean like shit cameo is a happy ending
Like fuck me man
Thank you dimsy dan for the cat sticker the neck with sticker
They are just old home humans kopium. He took control of the system the drone got fried, but he's up like done in the system
Yeah, so there's their stray two coming out and then we can like shove them in a robot and then we live happily ever after
Oh
Whenever you cry it reminds me what a sweet girl you are. I literally cannae handle it
Like why can't we not just like fucking be pod champ? Have you ever played pokemon mystery dungeon?
I think so, but I was very young so I didn't understand what was going on
Wow
Wasn't a model twitching
I look like it was the rooms a bit dark so it's probably why
He lives happily ever after anyway if there's a straight mean he's gonna have
To struggle for it. Don't cry. No, I'm like
Why I just wanted to be like one thing. I'm such a crybaby and everyone like literally can't can't beat the crybaby allegations
Well, that just thought I was supposed to be like this cool neko game
Um, well, you know you're mucking about and like a post-apocalyptic scenario and it's like oh by the way the person
That you started with oh the parish and I was like, oh, thanks for that
That's really gonna brighten up my day after that. No, seriously that I'm so happy
That the person who helped me through the entirety of the game
Who helped me translate and speak to all the robots and gave me all this advice and we discovered that was actually a human
And they were a scientist. Oh, no, that's lovely that they just perished right at the end
No, thanks for that really really cheered up my day really made my heart speed up. Okay. Yeah, like
Cute crying mummy cup
I don't need to beat the embrace the crybaby embrace that emotion. Honestly. Why?
Oh, can't he handle it
Oh, but we love her crybaby. Honestly, it's freaking terrible for it
So out of 10
Honestly, I have to admit
That was a very fair game in the gameplay
my only
thing is
Maybe give a directional point to where you're supposed to go
Then again, I can see the argument for being like
Look, we've given you signs of where the shops you need to go and I kept stumbling into the puzzle somehow
But I do it. I think at the start we took a lot of time
I can hear my fucking neighbour in the garden right now
I swear to god if he puts on that lawnmower
She's sobbing hard. No, I'm no I'm no sobbing. I'm all right
Um our little crybaby seaweed. Honestly
At least the cat survived. Oh, no, I wouldn't even touch the game
I'm sure if the cat perished in the game like everyone I would have heard about it and wouldn't even touch the damn thing
Um
Now you can't even parley vu with the robots. I know
Um, are they confirmed that there's a straight to in production? Hold on. Let me check
Straight
Let's see is straight to in production
Not like you see it in the dark straight who is not confirmed as of yet. Wow. I'm surprised
Sorry, I need to sync up my mouse, but I keep them up, don't I?
Strony has been keeping the sea salty because of these games. Honestly. I can't stop greeting
We say greeting in scots. So yeah, Strony that was four hours. So I guess five hours is to 100% the game
Yeah, I don't I mean, I don't really know what you'd get if you 100% assume just as memories
I think they're gonna do a different game in the same universe. It is still a pretty recent game. Is it? Oh, okay
I just remember when it came out. There was like a lot of hype about it
because like no one expected that
So
Yeah, we're learning
That was cute though. Um
We'll just say it was 10 out of 10
For me personally, no, however, I can definitely see this appealing to the masses and being very fair
Like I think gameplay wise I messed up twice in the entire thing
And if I knew what was coming up like once I learned what was coming up, I could avoid what happened. So
Yeah, I don't think it's a
a wee problem
Stray came out in 2020. Okay. No game games take like at least three years development at this point
And I think in 8.5 animation and music was good gameplay was simple, but good story was good
Story was great
um
Yeah, I think that was
I think it's definitely on the higher for me personally. It's not a 10 out of 10
However, I can completely see where it's a 10 out of 10 for other people like
Again fair gameplay wasn't asking me to do like a billion different things at one time
I'm sure maybe exploring for people that enjoy exploring, but I don't really enjoy talking to NPCs
um that much
um
I know some people enjoy the dilly dallying, but I don't know for that game
I was like, oh, let's go to the net like let's do the next mission. Let's do the next mission
Like let's not dilly dally and like stop to talk like I guess cameo is a good example of like
I did the whole campaign and I only talked to who I needed to to get my fruits on that
This is definitely one of those games of all time from what I've seen I would give an 8.5 and I don't see a need to play it
I personally wouldn't replay it, but it is a good game
The game is pretty lore heavy, is it?
I think maybe yeah, maybe if you solo explored and you know
Read everything there was to say and found all the wee secrets and memories and that maybe you know, it'd feel like a bit better
Yeah gameplay wise it isn't that appealing. Yeah, it's I would say it's relatively easy
Which I quite I'm enjoying an easy gaming experience these days. Like I'm really addicted to baltro
But it's so hard not to like slam it down every week. So I'm behaving. I promise there's no baltro for a couple of weeks
Um, I've really been enjoying stuff that doesn't require like insane reaction time
Because that's like where I get frustrated. I have to like replay the same mission over and over. I do wish we had our
aim
A cutscene where all the cats got together though. That's a bit annoying. I like understand the cats freeing back on the surface
But I wanted it to see its pals, you know, like is that is that too much to ask for chat noir?
In a two tail polka dot. Oh, I forgot his name and cally-cally clear. I think
Stray is one of those
huge
Intractable movie type games. I'm gonna not even pretend. I know what that word. We should have baltro Monday. Nah, I've got
I've planned a little bit ahead of what streams I'm doing when my dad gets here. Um
I've got an Orwell game. I'm not even kidding. It's like a 1984 game. I'm forcing you to play it with me
I don't care. I honestly don't care. I'm forcing you to play with me
And I'm sticking a tinfoil hat on me when we do the entire gameplay
I need to start using like vtuber assets like this more because the ears are so funny
Interactable, okay. Yeah, is that a retro game? No, it's like a
I don't know. You just like click through the text and stuff
I'll read it out though. Don't worry. I'll read it out
But yeah, that was good. I enjoyed that. I'm gonna is there any uh veal or girly pops on
Yeah, I mean the review said the game takes five hours. So
Uh, I really be stumbling very luckily into that stuff. Uh
Is there any veal or girls on that I can redirect into just the question
She be on Elden Ring. Let's effin go
Let's effin go
Elden Ring it is time. Rise do you turn is she playing at the proper way or is harem
Is harem coming into help her or is she doing it the proper way?
As the development team intended, what do you mean you don't play Elden Ring as a multiplayer experience?
What are you talking about? It's a perfect multiplayer experience
That yours are cute. Read them up it. Let us go. Oh, no, somebody save she be. She hasn't summoned anyone yet
Oh my god, she's so brave. I'm like as soon as as soon as I had access to the summoning circles. I was like
Come play with mome
Oh also, uh all my thumbnails are up like all my streams are up for this week
We are playing the jellybean game, which is called fall guys. So if you don't have fall guys
Installed please do it for me if you want to play with me. I'd like to play with you. That's okay
But I know some people don't like downloading the launcher because I think it's an EA game
And I'm sorry if you don't so it's okay if you don't want to download it and play with me because of the launcher because I know it's a
thing
A real pro gamer not like me
Yeah
Some girls just like being princess carried in games and some like a challenge
I think a lot of people will show you in that game. Yeah, but the reeflings get to touch me and get to jellybean pull on me
Not that I had to make a new epic account
Hackers tick my your epic freaking account. Wait. Did you spend money on it?
All downloaded and ready to go. I just don't like fall guys
We were playing other multi game experiences
We're actually going to be making puzzles together
In a week or so, but I'm going to hate what I'm going to make the image
And I'm going to make it really difficult and I'll see if we can do it
A bit those of us who have on steam
I think you can like play with me. No problem because I just give you the code
Who would hate the fortnite launcher? No, it's a fortnite. It's fall guy
No money, but I lost some of the free games I claimed. Um
Shocking
Puzzles with Johnny. Yeah, but I'm going to hide the screen
So you don't know what the puzzle is and then I'll give you the link and then we complete the artwork together
Um
I had to catch up on Isaac
So I'm ready for multiplayer when you said this game wants you to suffer. Yeah, you're right
I remember why I draw oh the game does not
Want you to win it is a punishing game. Um
Like I honestly enjoy just playing it casually
I've not actually hardcore tried to go for any unlocks in a very long time
I should have showed off my unlocks because I had a I've got two
Alternative characters that aren't unlocked on Isaac and I keep forgetting to get them
But yeah, the game does not like you like I'm pretty sure pretty much all my unlocks are like
I randomly stumbled upon an R key. Um, and then did what I needed to do
Um, but yeah, that was like a really good experience. Is this freaking shame that I cried honestly
I'm such a fucking crybaby. Can he stop it?
Um, but that was really good. Um as for what I'm going to do when I go off lane
I've got two more ASMR collab scripts to write and then I have
Officially like given everyone what they need to collab with what I would like them to give me for the collab and then
I'm going to take a break from doing asking people for ASMR collabs just for a teeny weeny bit
Um, and then I'm going to focus on my
sub scraper milestone. Thank you videos. Um
And also the meme videos we've actually got the pregnancy ASMR comment that sounds bizarre saying that in a sense
I've got the pregnancy ASMR coming up. I've got hypnotizes you to like, um
Pineapple on pizza. I hope you can sleep. Yes. Um, I get I'm probably gonna go for a nap
But it's it's the only way I seem to be able to sleep that minute is go lie down
And then when I wake up I do a big chunk of work
Like the girls all had shorts come out today if I'm not mistaken. I think the mercy might have had a short come out
Let me see one more check
Um, I ordered a four for a zero one of them, which is absolutely hilarious. I cannot wait for you guys to see it
Oh, no, the mercy one must come out tomorrow. So it's only a season one that came out. Um, I
gave any to she is gonna upload it when she wants to upload it
and
Yes, I've linked the ac short if you want to watch that literally it's in the the the chat
A right now at the top. It's a funny clip. I was absolutely hilarious
It might actually be the first a clip on the viewer like clip channel. Um
We're gonna very slowly start putting stuff up. Um
Sorry, I just opened up Marshmallow just to see if anyone said anything the first sentence I read
One of the reasons I love you so much is that you can't spell or read
Refling oh my god, you're not supposed to say that. I mean you can Amy has a new one with her rats
Oh, did she post it? Okay. Uh, I will link. Uh, I'm actually gonna link Emmys
Tomorrow's stream. I will pin Emmys. I've pinned acs today. I'll pin Emmys main. I'm not really that bothered about
Wait hypnosis about pineapple on pizza. I missed that
Um, when we were meme I was memeing with the reeflings like in another stream
And I think I was like, oh that would be a really funny meme video like someone said it and I was like, oh my god
What if I did it hypnotizes you to like pineapple on pizza ASMR because like obviously I like my meme and shitpost day one
Um, or a little illiterate little seaweed doesn't know our abc's or one two three's honestly. Um
What was the rest of that message though? I don't really know why but I can't stop myself from wanting to squeeze you tight in my embrace
And kiss you on the forehead when you spell something wrong, especially when you get flustered over at a dory
I always have. Oh, thank you reeflin. I'm glad it doesn't frustrate you
I feel like when people like see how I type it's like, oh my god, how does your mind work like that?
but like I don't I like trying not be mean to myself about it because
like I
I think it's like a good thing that I show like, oh, I don't know how to spell so I have to spell it phonetically in my head like I have to
Do things in my head like a bit different the way that like you might have been taught or you do otherwise
um
So yeah, I'm glad it doesn't frustrate you and you have the patience for how dumb dumb I am
More making hypnotizes for all four and all she likes but pineapple pizza is too far
Okay, dude. You're done. So what's the plan of attack tomorrow?
um
Uh
What is what are we doing tomorrow my good figures?
Uh community posts tomorrow's plan. Oh, I'm gonna show you how I write a some more collabs now
It's slightly different. It's slightly different. Hey, but I'm going to write my one-on-one collabs with everyone in via lure
Um, sorry, I have snot in the back of my schnozer because I was crying
Um, and then I'm doing a membership ASMR. So yes, hopefully
The freaking neighbor doesn't start cutting his grass
And the members we love everything you do. Oh, thank you. I love everything you do too
Especially when you let me do certain things to you
I offer you an accord refling
Congrats on 9 000 subscribers. I know. Oh my gosh. I'm like so I'm in so much ASMR there
I need to I need to get my button gear, but I I think I'm editing an emmy and ac collab and
I'm going to put it in a unlisted on emmy's channel and she can put it live whenever she pleases. Um
But yes, I think that's my job today finish
a the collabs scripts
Finish the emmy and ac ASMR and if I've got any more fuel in the tank
I'll edit the sheebie ASMR and she can put that up when she's ready
Yay
After yesterday you aren't the dumb cutler fish anymore
uh
Steady on I am I am so
I'm a switch, okay
Stroney, you can do literally anything to me. You're not supposed to say that part out loud. You're supposed to be like, oh

redirect into sheepsters. Um, I'll say hi for a moment actually. I really need to stop dropping and rolling
I'm like in alias this stream. I was like, thank you for looking after the reefing spy
