1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
You wanted a fero-kusou gaki, I gave you a ferrokusou dente.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,300
You wanted a doten hag, I gave you a doten hag.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,260
You wanted a dorky yandere, I gave you a dorky yandere!

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,340
You wanted a masochistic brocon, I gave you a masochistic drozon.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,980
You wanted a mild dominatrix, I gave you a mild dominatrix.

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:33,980
And now I bring you the VTuber that no one asked for, a goddamn hypnotic cuttlefish.

7
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:55,980
Did I kick or did I f***ing kick, ladies and gentlemen?

8
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,980
I hope you enjoyed your evening so far.

9
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,980
Let me formally introduce myself.

10
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,980
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Strony Cuttle.

11
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,980
The surname is because I'm a cuttlefish.

12
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:16,980
And Strony because I am the daughter of the gamer Strontium, my dad's gamer tag.

13
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,980
And I wouldn't be here without him, you know, because he came from his b***h sack.

14
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,980
Anyway, age, age, ladies and gentlemen.

15
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:27,980
Oh, yet again, I have failed the VTuber challenge of tell us your age.

16
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,980
Cuttlefish normally live to a year, so time's ticking.

17
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:37,980
Anyway, my birthday is October 10th, which is actually National Sweden Cuttlefish Day.

18
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,980
They're both step-for-the-pod, so I don't mind sharing that birthday.

19
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:48,980
My height is 162 centimetres, which makes me 5'3", because I forgot to update this hi-ho over here now.

20
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,980
For my languages, turns out, if you're born in Scotland,

21
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,980
the British government recognises Scottish slang as its own language,

22
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,980
so in your face, I can speak two languages.

23
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,980
Grace, I am a cuttlefish, and I'm also good at the 100-metre sprint.

24
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,980
Thank you, thank you, I'll be here all week.

25
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,980
My likes and dislikes.

26
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,980
ASMR, if you like ASMR, you're going to get spoiled, rotten on my channel.

27
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,980
Or any of the VLOR girls' channels.

28
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,980
Shows your plasters.

29
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,980
Oh God, can you see it? Wait, you're not supposed to see that part!

30
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,980
I like seeing victory on my screen because I could use any tiddly wink of serotonin.

31
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,980
And I also like plasters and band-aids.

32
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,980
I wonder why.

33
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,980
For no nefarious reason.

34
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,980
For my dislikes.

35
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,980
I don't like bullies in video games.

36
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,980
Your teammates aren't all going to magically be MLG pros, so relax.

37
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,980
I don't like serious people, I don't like seriousness.

38
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,980
I think my gen mates can all pray for a bunch of bouts.

39
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,980
I can't be serious, it's terrible.

40
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,980
I'm the most unprofessional person they've probably ever worked with in their entire life.

41
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,980
My hi-ho.

42
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,980
And I don't like mongolian throat singing, I'm so sorry.

43
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,980
People seem to really like it, but I don't.

44
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,980
It doesn't sound nice.

45
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,980
Apologize to the one mongolian throat singer that's watching right now.

46
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,980
Huggy, I'm nice and generic.

47
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,980
Sorry, there's nothing interesting about my taste.

48
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,980
Movies, Lord of the Rings.

49
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,980
Definitely come.

50
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,980
Animes, nice and generic again.

51
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,980
Books, I actually started reading books this year.

52
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,980
I know this sounds crazy as a sentence because people read books in general.

53
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,980
Me, however, I started this year.

54
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,980
I really like dystopian books that talk about human nature and how humans are stinky poo poo heads.

55
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:32,980
For my music, Hatsunomiku and Atarashigako, I want to see them live if it's possible.

56
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,980
Oh, yeah, just a wee bit of a gamer.

57
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,980
It doesn't mean I'm good at games.

58
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,980
Now before there's that one person that's like,

59
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,980
eh, you've played all these games, that means you're an MLG pro.

60
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,980
No, relax, relax.

61
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,980
I've played games full stop.

62
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,980
Okay, these are the games that I remember playing or just kind of like have a good,

63
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,980
yeah, play them type thing, okay.

64
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,980
See who's been an Xbox gamer to apologize for my goals.

65
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,980
I want to get monetized on YouTube, so feel free to subscribe

66
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,980
because we have been called like crazy since then.

67
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:09,980
I want to stream so much that you can basically read everything in my voice.

68
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,980
You know, you'll be Scots yourself and you can apply for citizenship and all that good stuff.

69
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,980
I also want to create a Mega A Smart collab with my gen mates,

70
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,980
which I've already got quite a few on the way.

71
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,980
So don't worry, it's coming.

72
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,980
You just got to wait.

73
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,980
I have a childhood dream actually of 100,000 gamer score

74
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,980
and it's actually possible now with Xbox Game Pass.

75
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,980
I would absolutely love to explore a heken amount of childhood games

76
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,980
and I would love to play like your childhood games as well.

77
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,980
There's a little fun factoid about me.

78
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,980
I'm a wee bit of a workaholic.

79
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,980
So I would like to say that for every 1,000 subscribers I get on my YouTube channel,

80
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,980
I'm going to upload a celebratory.

81
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,980
Really hard to say that if you're Scottish.

82
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,980
ASMR video pair 1,000 subscribers.

83
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,980
I've already got like tons ready to go, so don't be shy.

84
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,980
You know what to do, wink, wink.

85
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,980
I also want to challenge myself.

86
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,980
I want to collab.

87
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,980
I want to make ASMR collabs with over 100 different v-tubers

88
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,980
and I'm actually so much of a workaholic.

89
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:19,980
I already have three confirmed with v-tubers outside of VLR, so I'm very serious about that.

90
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,980
If you ever have a 3DO, you're a v-tuber, I'm coming to find you in your DMs.

91
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,980
I would love if we could read Lord of the Rings together.

92
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,980
I think it would be so fun.

93
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,980
I'm not a very strong reader, but I think it would be really cute to do like a little

94
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,980
before the end of stream, read one chapter or something like that.

95
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,980
And last but certainly not least, I would love to get stream sniped.

96
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,980
I absolutely adore it.

97
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,980
I love playing multiplayer games where you can join me.

98
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,980
You can have an amazing time and have so much fun.

99
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,980
It's just one of my favorite things, okay?

100
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,980
So please do not be shy.

101
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,980
These are my goals.

102
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,980
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

103
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,980
I'm dumb.

104
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,980
Okay, I'm really dumb.

105
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,980
I don't know how to come up with tags.

106
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,980
I'm not funny.

107
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,980
I'm not good with puns.

108
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,980
So I am more than happy to take any suggestions.

109
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,980
My ushi marks are squid, but I'm a cuttlefish.

110
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,980
And then the second emoji kind of looks like a man bowing.

111
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,980
Hmm?

112
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,980
Hmm?

113
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,980
Maybe that is a hint to what I might try to make content-wise.

114
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,980
And for fan names, there is only going to be one option.

115
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,980
Come on.

116
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,980
Let's not beat around the bush.

117
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,980
You are my refling.

118
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,980
You will always be my refling.

119
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,980
And thank you so much for waiting.

120
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,980
I have bloody missed you.

121
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,980
Special shout out to Nari and Squishy Goal.

122
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,980
You may have noticed a bit of a trending pattern.

123
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,980
Squishy Goal that conceptualized us all and now I helped out and made us come to life,

124
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,980
which is beautiful, beautiful.

125
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,980
So thank you everyone who came together to make this fantastic gen of indulge.

126
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,980
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

127
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,980
Most people get to do, oh, this is my gen mate's impression.

128
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,980
Me.

129
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,980
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

130
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,980
I picked my gen mates.

131
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,980
Do you understand?

132
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,980
I picked them, okay?

133
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,980
Now I'm going to tell you why I picked them.

134
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,980
Mercy's determination.

135
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,980
She was going to make it no matter what.

136
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,980
The definition of mercy in the dictionary, if you look up, it just says determined, okay?

137
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,980
There was no way in heck she was not going to get in.

138
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,980
That's all I'm going to say on that one.

139
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,980
Emi.

140
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:32,980
Emi said to someone who's being rude to her to keep themselves safe and Minecraft

141
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,980
and then she instantly got the part, okay?

142
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:42,980
I say, I say, oh, I say has fantastic experience and history and she's such a hard worker.

143
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,980
She had the most professional application.

144
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:51,980
Even though English is in her first language and now I got them, I say you're impressive.

145
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,980
Then Azura.

146
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,980
Okay, I describe Azura as my little diamond in the rough.

147
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,980
Now hear me out before you're like, it's not an insult, relax.

148
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,980
I'm not told the full story yet.

149
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:08,980
I was going to cross off Azura's stream as I was reviewing her because she wasn't talking.

150
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,980
She wasn't interacting.

151
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,980
And then she said three words in that voice.

152
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,980
Azura.

153
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,980
She instantly became Azura.

154
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,980
She said three words and she got the damn part.

155
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,980
Sheebie.

156
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,980
Sheebie is everything.

157
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,980
I should have been in another life, okay?

158
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,980
I could not have asked for better gen mates.

159
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:33,980
I am blown away that these girls even have freaking applied to such a crazy idea.

160
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:40,980
And here we are, debut and you guys have shown nothing but love and support and we are all so thankful.

161
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,980
I'm sure I speak for all of us when we were like, holy fuck, thank you.

162
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,980
Right, let me take you to Zabbit.

163
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,980
I forgot to pull it.

164
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,980
It's for decoration.

165
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,980
Okay, the tentacle in the back is for decoration.

166
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,980
Let me do the full body.

167
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,980
Let's start with the full body.

168
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,980
It may have a bandaid on for reasons.

169
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,980
But as you see, I got some swivelly hips.

170
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,980
Thank you, Nari.

171
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,980
So if you didn't know, I actually have what's known as a French manicure and pedicure.

172
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,980
Again.

173
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,980
Don't even be careful with my thighs because of the bandaid.

174
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,980
Is this smart?

175
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,980
Is this what?

176
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,980
Okay, okay.

177
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,980
I don't think that's smart.

178
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,980
As you can see, if you look really close to the elbows, I have pearlescent to my outfit.

179
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,980
My outfit isn't white, it's pearlescent.

180
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,980
So I shimmer as I move about.

181
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,980
It's fantastic.

182
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,980
And so does my seashells at the top too.

183
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:38,980
But yeah, I'm in the Yukata because it's a homage to Japanese culture because without Japanese culture, let's be honest.

184
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,980
Any VTubers would be here.

185
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,980
Okay, let me get real close.

186
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,980
Hopefully this isn't uncomfortable.

187
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,980
I know some people aren't like the best with eye contact.

188
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,980
If I open my eyes, it opens too.

189
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,980
Oh, and I'm sad.

190
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,980
I'm sad.

191
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,980
I have pupil restrict.

192
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,980
What did you say?

193
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,980
I'm on a muse.

194
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,980
You failed me.

195
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,980
These are my heart eyes.

196
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,980
I love them.

197
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,980
You ever seen a blushing cultfish before?

198
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,980
You know how cultfish have hypnotic patterns?

199
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,980
May I please do this for you?

200
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,980
Are you ready?

201
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,980
Hey.

202
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,980
We're going to be using this for a lot of ASMR.

203
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,980
I don't know.

204
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,980
But if you're really struggling, like if you're really struggling, how about this?

205
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,980
Yeah, it's over for you.

206
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,980
Just admit it, it's over for you.

207
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,980
I mean, how can you resist?

208
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,980
How can you resist this little Scottish accent?
