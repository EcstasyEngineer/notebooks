00:00.000 --> 00:17.520
Pessing! This is how I sound over the game, in game audio of BALATRO. Not to be confused

00:17.520 --> 00:25.680
with BALATRO because I can't read. Apparently the card in the middle is actually an A in

00:25.680 --> 00:32.680
the game's title, so it's BALATRO, okay? BALATRO.

00:32.680 --> 00:41.640
Ah! Jeez. The delay on when I click go live is astronomical these days, I don't know what's

00:41.640 --> 00:53.200
going on. Pessing! Dear reflings, please type 1 on your keyboard to show that we're

00:53.200 --> 00:59.120
synced. How was your royal flush? Terrible. I'm baking a loaf of bread because I've got

00:59.120 --> 01:03.800
some issues. Okay, no see that was fast. I think it just takes a couple of minutes for

01:03.800 --> 01:11.040
the dang thing to register. Right, so what I said when I click go live, but I don't think

01:11.040 --> 01:17.560
you heard it, is the game isn't called BALATRO, the game is called BALATRO because it's an

01:17.560 --> 01:25.100
A, the A's in the thumbnail is an A, and I've been calling it BALATRO because I've been

01:25.100 --> 01:30.880
removing the A and the T because of the scots. I'm like, I'll be playing BALATRO, BALATRO,

01:30.880 --> 01:37.480
any BALATRO players? That's her absolute shawls behaviour. Good morning, good evening, good

01:37.480 --> 01:45.720
afternoon, I am none other than your huh, stranny cuddles. Now, originally on the agendination

01:45.720 --> 01:52.400
it was Elden Ring, but unfortunately I have absolutely disastrous news, it's not disastrous,

01:52.400 --> 02:01.800
it's not a big deal. I was up working after my beloved Mercy stream, if you guys did not

02:01.800 --> 02:07.360
know, I got to stream yesterday with Mercy playing Goose game, and it was the worst type

02:07.360 --> 02:11.960
or choice, or choice together if you want to say both words at the same time as I just

02:11.960 --> 02:19.520
did there. It was the worst choice because Mercy has very severe motion sickness and

02:19.520 --> 02:30.200
that camera angle would not stop spinning the entire gameplay, so poor Mercy had to

02:30.200 --> 02:34.600
go, or I sent her off, I wasn't happy with it. But the long and short, if you missed

02:34.600 --> 02:38.960
the Goose game with Mercy and you don't have time to watch the VOD, Mercy did a big scary

02:38.960 --> 02:44.560
burp and both of us recognised what that burp meant and it meant her digestive tract was

02:44.560 --> 02:49.200
getting ready to reverse due to her motion sickness, yeah like her motion sickness when

02:49.200 --> 02:54.560
playing video games, but we had an absolutely fantastic time being Goose that one point

02:54.560 --> 03:01.120
she was controlling me as a Goose, her controller input was moving me, so every time I tried

03:01.120 --> 03:08.240
to move, I was pushing against Mercy's command, I was like who's hypnotising who you are?

03:08.240 --> 03:12.640
That's not allowed, literally the reverse scrawny, that's not allowed. But it was an

03:12.640 --> 03:21.040
absolutely lovely collab, I'm so happy. I also, the girls have a beautiful Uno collab

03:21.040 --> 03:26.320
coming out next year, oh my god spoilers for next week's schedule, oh my god you're spoiling,

03:27.280 --> 03:34.560
originally I was going to participate in the Uno, but I'm not anymore because originally

03:34.560 --> 03:39.360
Shibi was, but then Shibi had a job, so Shibi couldn't do it, but then Shibi quit her job,

03:39.360 --> 03:46.400
like an absolute boss, like a beast. So now she has time to do it and she's going balls to the

03:46.400 --> 03:52.800
wall with streams which I'm so happy, I'm so glad for her success, special thank you to anyone who

03:52.800 --> 04:00.560
has supported any of the girls, you are enabling them to level up in real life, unironically.

04:01.600 --> 04:07.040
Because Shibi literally, speaking of poker, if you didn't know Balatro is about poker,

04:07.840 --> 04:13.040
Shibi literally said I'm all in on Vehler, she's put all of her stonks in Vehler, so thank you to

04:13.040 --> 04:18.000
anyone who is making such a risk worthwhile, whether that's clipping, whether that's interacting

04:18.000 --> 04:22.720
with her posts, watching her vods because it generates money if you watch vods because there's

04:23.120 --> 04:30.640
advertisements on them I think, I don't know, I'll need to check, I actually, so from the behind

04:30.640 --> 04:36.240
the scenes, you can tell YouTube to place ads during a stream, but I say no no no no, I'll place

04:36.240 --> 04:40.240
some YouTube, wink wink, I'll totally put ads down in the middle of a stream, I do not put ads

04:40.240 --> 04:46.560
down in the middle of a stream, I don't like it. The VOD, I believe should play an ad at the start

04:46.560 --> 04:49.840
and the end of the VOD, I don't know if it does it in the middle, I'll need to check that out

04:49.840 --> 04:55.520
because I've been a knot in Ellie and I've not been checking. You did great with the girls,

04:55.520 --> 05:05.600
oh stop it, stop it, did you do a royal flush, no, so I had to take, I was up working but I've got

05:05.600 --> 05:12.960
two more ASMR collabs agreed upon, I sent away two scripts, I actually need to make an ASMR script

05:12.960 --> 05:20.960
for Mercy because I came up with a really good YouTube ASMR roleplay script for Mercy that I

05:20.960 --> 05:28.880
absolutely adore, so I need to work on that shortly. So originally it was going to be Elden Ring in a

05:28.880 --> 05:38.880
12 hour stream but I'm like, I need to cook for these girls, I need to, I'm needing to tell them

05:38.880 --> 05:43.680
there's possibility, there's a talent manager maybe coming in but I'm going to ask the girls

05:43.680 --> 05:50.640
what they actually want because there's no point in getting this chicken, she's a Vtuber herself,

05:50.640 --> 05:55.280
she does her own content, she has experience doing projects, that kind of thing, it's a she,

05:55.280 --> 06:04.160
it's a she before anyone fucking says I'm in, they're replying to my email, you're not having

06:04.160 --> 06:10.240
access to my daughters, okay. Kings Lupus, thank you for becoming a member, I appreciate it.

06:11.440 --> 06:18.240
After two hours of Chucky Balattro, we are going to be doing membership ASMR and then I believe

06:18.240 --> 06:24.880
that is my membership debt paid for the week, yarg. Originally next week I was going to watch the

06:24.880 --> 06:32.640
Barbie movie, I might switch it out for something else and I need to decide on what series we're

06:32.640 --> 06:38.640
watching during RuneScape which I'll be curious, I do have a cup of tea, can you hear my little

06:38.640 --> 06:47.360
thingies against it? It might be good to delay the ER to let people enjoy the DLC first but you've

06:47.360 --> 06:51.520
got 24 hours to enjoy because I'm doing endurance tomorrow so as the girls are on their own for the

06:51.520 --> 06:56.320
next like week, I'm playing with my refunds in that opening shot case, I'm playing with my

06:56.320 --> 06:59.520
refunds for a week straight, we're doing an endurance a week straight, we're joining my

06:59.520 --> 07:06.080
games and you're all holding my hand, okay. I don't want to hear about anything from the girls,

07:06.080 --> 07:14.720
sorry, yous are on your own, go speak to management, that isn't me okay, go speak to someone else

07:14.720 --> 07:21.200
because I ain't me, I ain't me, I can't, that book is closed, I ain't talking to yous, I'm no interested.

07:23.360 --> 07:28.080
Literally, oh you've got plans, don't care, don't care, not opening your DM, if I don't see it,

07:28.080 --> 07:37.360
it's not a problem, kidding, I love you girls but it's been a long time coming that I could

07:37.360 --> 07:45.840
play with my refunds again okay, so you're gonna have to, you're gonna have to give me some time

07:45.840 --> 07:53.040
because the refunds have waited a very long time for me and it's been bloody nice being back so

07:54.000 --> 08:00.080
do forgive me girls if any of you are lurking, I need my replin, my replin, my replin, please

08:00.080 --> 08:07.280
don't die, you know like if it was like a little Sims 2 bar instead of environment because, or maybe

08:07.280 --> 08:12.480
instead of hygiene actually, I've not had to shower in a couple of days, normally I shower at least

08:12.480 --> 08:19.520
like every other day but recently, you know my little refill and bar is low and after endurance,

08:19.760 --> 08:27.520
how you call it, endurance, Elden Ring, I will, I'll be good to go, okay, so right, I'm going to

08:27.520 --> 08:40.640
drip drip drip, my honey tea, I have my script writing, my membership script writing stream

08:41.600 --> 08:48.560
is coming up, I ask permission for the girls if they're comfortable with me writing stuff

08:49.360 --> 08:57.520
live for them and I got a few thumbs up, I've got a few requests not to do everything which I said

08:57.520 --> 09:03.040
no that's not, the reality isn't going to be like I'll do it all at once but that script writing

09:03.040 --> 09:12.320
screen stream is most likely going to be roughly two hours, there'll be a bootstrip script, sorry

09:12.320 --> 09:20.080
there'll be a boot script, there'll possibly be two ASMR collabs with other VTubers,

09:21.360 --> 09:26.320
I actually need to write my one-on-one collab with the VLR girls because I've not actually done

09:26.320 --> 09:34.160
that part yet, like I need to do my like, I want to do like, so for Emi, I want to do big sister

09:34.160 --> 09:40.960
and little sister tease you with Tingles ASMR, I think that would be adorable, AC,

09:43.520 --> 09:49.440
I wanted to do like, I actually want to see AC in a school uniform, that sounds really weird,

09:49.440 --> 09:56.160
I'm sorry I said that out loud, that was an insane thought, I wanted to like AC to be like a weird,

09:56.160 --> 10:05.280
not bully but maybe like some sort of like high school roleplay with me and AC together,

10:05.920 --> 10:11.440
maybe like one of those like after school clubs and we were forced to come together to do it and

10:11.440 --> 10:17.120
then like, AC grabs your phone and she notices that you watch ASMR and then like, well and we're

10:17.120 --> 10:22.160
all just kind of like, well we either do nothing for an hour or we could just muck around and do

10:22.160 --> 10:37.360
ASMR on each other, you want Gairu AC? Gairu? Yeah, Shibi, Shibi is my other half, I wouldn't,

10:37.920 --> 10:40.800
what would I want to do with her if she's my other half?

10:41.680 --> 10:54.640
What would we do? Maybe a blindfold type of roleplay would fit Shibi very well,

10:55.200 --> 11:01.280
if you didn't know, I try and do the theme of the person I'm collabing with, I've actually

11:01.280 --> 11:07.840
got a really good few themes, I did win with them, not to ruin it, I don't think she actually

11:08.080 --> 11:14.400
streams at this time so she's not even gonna be awake, I did a hexa collab and at the end of it

11:14.400 --> 11:19.040
we hypnotise you to mind break you and to only watching us and I thought that was really cute

11:20.960 --> 11:24.960
but before you like, do you have to put a disclaimer, it's not it's not real like actual

11:24.960 --> 11:29.200
induction or anything like that so I don't think there's going to be necessarily any induction

11:29.200 --> 11:34.720
needed at all for it, sorry any disclaimer needed at all for it, also can we get one minute

11:34.720 --> 11:40.320
silence for the cheek clap ASMR video, oh that's my best fucking audio, oh actually that's another

11:40.320 --> 11:49.360
thing, I am editing my third audio that goes up like the day, I need to edit it after the ASMR

11:49.360 --> 11:53.280
history, I've got like a lot of things I need to catch up on, I need to like send stuff to editors

11:53.280 --> 11:57.440
and I need to do my own stuff and I need to do this and do that and look we're getting there,

11:57.440 --> 12:04.400
we're getting there, per mimosa, per mimosa for one, she was the first person that accepted a

12:04.400 --> 12:10.080
ASMR collab with me and sent me her lines and she must fucking look on her subscription list and be

12:10.080 --> 12:15.520
like ah she's streaming for 12 hours again, yeah that sounds about right, per mimosa she has been

12:15.520 --> 12:21.680
waiting patiently, I am going to try and finish everyone's that is on standby, today that is my

12:21.680 --> 12:35.760
job, let me let me finish more of my tea, for Azura, I think double heartbeat would go crazy with me

12:35.760 --> 12:46.240
and Azura and a kind of sleep aid rest between us type of audio, I think that would go incredibly

12:46.320 --> 12:53.280
hard with Azura just from how naturally soothing her voice is, I would absolutely love to do something

12:53.280 --> 12:58.160
like that and we kind of like do tingles as you, the listener fall asleep, maybe you're feeling a

12:58.160 --> 13:03.040
bit rough and you're just eating some extra TLC, I think that would be good with Azura,

13:03.600 --> 13:22.560
so me and Mercy are actually kind, we're not quite the same side of the coin with each other

13:23.440 --> 13:32.400
so I want to hypnotize to Mind Break, she wants to break you in because you're resistant to her

13:32.400 --> 13:42.320
so we've got a bit of a similarity, a bit of a lurking theme, I'm wondering if I could get

13:42.320 --> 13:50.080
Mercy into a hypno, maybe Mercy comes to me because she needs help to hypnotize Senpai

13:51.760 --> 13:56.320
because you're being extra resistant because resistant, if you didn't know resistant hypnosis

13:56.400 --> 14:02.880
is actually quite big where it's like me the person speaking like acknowledges that you're

14:02.880 --> 14:10.160
resistant so well but then you use phrases such as sooner or later you're going to break like

14:10.160 --> 14:15.600
resistant, there's no point in resisting like this kind of stuff, any chance for ace marvin

14:16.320 --> 14:29.920
yes please um yes those are my one-on-one collabs I actually used to do with girls,

14:29.920 --> 14:36.720
Emmer's is about to go on holiday so I'm not gonna ask for that until she's over the hedge,

14:37.680 --> 14:38.720
do you remember that movie?

14:41.360 --> 14:48.240
Strony is a Bork confirmed, oh my god the Bork scared me so much but then they introduced Seven

14:48.240 --> 14:54.240
and Nine and then oh the Bork turned the Bork turned me on so much, I love Seven of Nine

14:57.440 --> 15:04.160
she my favorite, Penpal's about to suffer, Strony you using, well there's a bit of a

15:04.880 --> 15:10.320
no, Strony uses a refland to demonstrate how to mind break someone so Mercy can, oh

15:11.520 --> 15:16.880
see Mercy wouldn't necessarily, um actually no that's really good, fuck you I'm stealing that

15:18.240 --> 15:24.560
I am literally copying paste in that and putting it in my little notes this gorge

15:24.960 --> 15:34.880
this is for uh what's your name, Mercy Collab, Emi Collab is big, it is wee sister, oh sorry

15:34.880 --> 15:38.800
little sister you can't, I don't think I could put wee sister because everyone would be like is she

15:38.800 --> 15:49.440
passing, Emi Collab is little sister and big sister tingle you mercilessly, I see I want some

15:49.520 --> 15:56.240
sort of like feral bratty, oh bratty school girl that makes much more sense bratty school, no it

15:56.240 --> 16:03.440
doesn't make sense because it's supposed to be after school class, after school club goes wrong

16:04.160 --> 16:16.480
and goes tingley, goes ASMR, sexual, it doesn't but you know what I mean, um Azura double heartbeat

16:17.120 --> 16:24.880
sleep aid tingle layers reassurance for bad day nice and simple and then sheepsters

16:26.320 --> 16:32.560
who goes there blindfolded um blindfolded tingle experience with

16:34.240 --> 16:38.160
30 different tingles how about that 30 different tingles a little cheeky challenge

16:40.640 --> 16:46.160
okay that is now in my notes discord so I can hold myself accountable to such dastardly acts

16:46.320 --> 16:52.560
the girls are comfortable if I write certain scripts on stream and we can certainly do explore

16:52.560 --> 16:59.680
those kind of things so you can quite literally get me and my VTuber companion to say what you

16:59.680 --> 17:03.520
want to hear so don't be don't be afraid to um

17:07.120 --> 17:13.520
mm-hmm right bilateral I don't know who the game dev is

17:16.800 --> 17:21.760
shall we get into it I know how poker works I do not know how oh

17:22.640 --> 17:25.920
hello there my name is Jimbo I'm here to help you learn to play

17:26.560 --> 17:30.720
your goal is to earn chips and defeat the enemy blind

17:32.560 --> 17:37.200
this here is a small blind you only need to score 300 chips to beat it

17:41.680 --> 17:46.240
select the small blind to start the round okay thank you Jimbo

17:47.200 --> 17:51.840
oh you earned chips by playing poker hands

17:53.440 --> 17:57.440
each poker hand earns a base amount of chips multiplied by some multi

17:59.200 --> 18:05.040
see your poker hands in the run info area along with other info what about your current turn

18:06.400 --> 18:11.680
run info straight flush oh my god actually tells you how to play

18:12.080 --> 18:20.400
what the fuck is a high card right straight flush um I understand a straight flush four of a

18:20.400 --> 18:29.520
kind full house is three and two yeah flush is flush is five cards that share the same suit

18:29.520 --> 18:35.520
I'm gonna have to keep that in mind you know that straight straight five cards in a row consecutive

18:35.520 --> 18:43.120
ranks but not the same three of a kind yes with two other unscorable cards that's fine

18:43.120 --> 18:48.080
two pairs that's possible and you can throw away the fifth oh so you have to play five a pair

18:48.080 --> 18:55.120
just simply throw away three but what the heck is if the plate hand is not any of the above hands

18:56.320 --> 19:02.560
only the highest ranked card scores wow okay okay I'm not

19:06.240 --> 19:12.720
okay cards also earn you some chips hover to hover over to see

19:15.040 --> 19:21.600
now select now select up to five cards to play and press play hand uh we've got

19:23.680 --> 19:29.360
have we even got anything we've got a double here uh can I not do anything with these trips

19:29.920 --> 19:36.880
they're not a triple but whatever we'll learn oh shit I've just wasted them okay we're learning

19:36.880 --> 19:44.000
relax I'm learning okay let's try that again you can also discard up to five selected cards

19:44.000 --> 19:50.640
to try and make it an even stronger hand try it all right that's a double there eight seven six five

19:50.720 --> 19:55.280
so what we need I don't know the two yous can go I guess

19:57.440 --> 20:01.280
hey carefully you only have limited numbers of hands and discards per round

20:02.160 --> 20:09.600
earn 300 chips before you run out of hands good luck okay right uh eight seven six five oh piss

20:10.320 --> 20:16.240
I thought we had it uh we're doing all right we've got two pairs and then we'll throw away the three

20:16.240 --> 20:17.280
I guess play hand

20:22.000 --> 20:27.040
yeah don't have to play five oh you don't have to play five I'm learning oh god I've got two more

20:27.040 --> 20:35.520
hands to play double see these are two doubles here oh I've also got that as well but kings are

20:35.520 --> 20:39.360
kings are higher double than double five so just play hand play ball

20:39.360 --> 20:52.480
oh oh oh jeez I'm almost gonna lose we have five discards

20:55.920 --> 21:00.400
um honestly I'm tempted to throw like all of these away

21:04.080 --> 21:09.280
and go for the oh what does this mean doubles two doubles and then just throw that in there for

21:09.280 --> 21:14.720
the hell of it why no two doubles they should okay that's perfectly fine more than adequate more

21:14.720 --> 21:23.680
than adequate that was a good throw away there we go we did it 300 I know it was very terrible

21:23.680 --> 21:31.680
gameplay but uh cash out we got three dollars nicely done now that you are flush with cash

21:31.760 --> 21:36.720
you can buy some new cards from the shop well but try buying this handsome devil

21:37.920 --> 21:43.920
buy this is one of the 150 jokers that you can add to your run every joker does something different

21:44.640 --> 21:51.120
this one adds four plus multiplier to every hand you play be picky you can only carry five joker

21:51.120 --> 21:58.800
cards at a time okay now buy the other card from the show enhances two selected cards

21:58.960 --> 22:06.800
oh wait ain't that not banged in the Isaac card this tired card is a consumable

22:06.800 --> 22:14.000

22:14.000 --> 22:21.600
cards at a time if you save up enough you can buy voucher voucher oh voucher vouchers passively

22:21.600 --> 22:26.880

22:27.040 --> 22:36.160
blind a persona reference so uh and check out both of the booster packs in every shop they're

22:36.160 --> 22:42.160
fully goodies oh i like the i like how they pop out i don't know how the development team is

22:42.160 --> 22:48.160
for this but um it's such like a i'm i'm enjoying like we pixel games at the moment honestly i'm

22:48.160 --> 22:55.760
going nuts for them i finally watched the legend of zelda trailer reveal why did they have to make

22:55.760 --> 23:04.240
it so cartoony it's just one guy for the dev team shot up he came up with all of this that's fantastic

23:05.120 --> 23:13.520
um select the big bind will earn some cash or tap or skip it to get a tag each tag has a unique

23:13.520 --> 23:20.320
effect but keep an eye on the boss wind it has the ability you'll it has an ability you'll need

23:20.320 --> 23:28.000
to plan around discard two random cards pair hand played oh wow okay and if you beat it then

23:28.000 --> 23:38.640
the anti goes up and all blinds become harder ups the ante okay beat ante eight to win now

23:38.640 --> 23:44.720
choose your path great well gives one dollar pair unused discard this one we'll give two

23:45.280 --> 23:54.880

23:54.880 --> 24:00.320
more cards remember you can rearrange the jokers trigger an order from left to right but we only

24:00.320 --> 24:05.760
have one and make sure you use your consumables select after two cards in your hand and press use

24:05.760 --> 24:14.640
on the territory to enhance them enhances two selected cards to multiply okay we have two jacks

24:14.640 --> 24:28.640
already so we can use them as a pair wow they're scored now okay i mean we can submit two doubles

24:28.640 --> 24:37.600
right off the bat why do we want to throw away though maybe just throw away the two for now

24:39.200 --> 24:47.520

24:48.400 --> 24:55.360

get to it right what are these the joker gains one multiplier pair consecutive hand played without

26:55.760 --> 27:02.480
a scoring that is far too intricate for me this joker gains a multiplier for each card sold

27:03.680 --> 27:09.200
that does nothing for me so what's about her permanently gain one discard each round

27:09.760 --> 27:11.760
the um that looks good

27:13.760 --> 27:15.760
hmm

27:16.400 --> 27:22.880

27:29.280 --> 27:37.200

27:58.960 --> 28:05.920
huh wait a minute i didn't watch enough gameplay in order to understand what happens if i skip

28:05.920 --> 28:13.440
oh maybe just play every round uh are you making the clapping ASMR somewhere else

28:13.440 --> 28:20.000
if you skip you get that reward wait but that's an insane upgrade flush by three flush oh wait no

28:20.000 --> 28:24.320
flush is the hard one that i'll never get so there's no point in doing that

28:26.720 --> 28:37.040
um oh very bad hand very very bad hand indeed we've got a triple but that's it

28:37.120 --> 28:43.360

29:13.280 --> 29:20.320
heart's flush oh my god oh thank god you said that oh i could have upgraded the flush but didn't

29:20.320 --> 29:21.920
because i didn't think it was possible

29:22.160 --> 29:29.600

29:30.400 --> 29:34.880

30:41.200 --> 30:46.800

31:04.240 --> 31:11.760
what is a straight what's the straight uh or straight is one two three four five that's so specific

31:13.280 --> 31:19.040

31:19.760 --> 31:26.640

31:45.920 --> 31:54.880
10 9 a straight level one yeah whoa this joker is insane like i've even got a triple here

31:56.160 --> 32:00.240
uh maybe should have gone for a full house what's more stronger straight or full house

32:01.040 --> 32:07.920
okay we're already halfway there wow um we can do a full house with twos

32:11.680 --> 32:18.720
and then a double with sixes full house oh full house looks good you have a street street what

32:20.080 --> 32:23.680
where oh my god i'm an idiot i do have a street so street is stronger

32:24.640 --> 32:33.040
i mean we won oh we did not win yet holy moly moly wait what's the straight five four three

32:33.040 --> 32:37.200
no i don't well ruined it now have no let's just do a full house again and we've got it okay

32:37.200 --> 32:47.280
we've got it if i do the full house sorry run info for help isn't it the worst right straight

32:47.920 --> 32:58.080
consecutive rank all the same straight four of a kind is higher a full house is actually higher

32:58.080 --> 33:09.600
wow okay then a flush of the same suit a straight is wait what oh a straight flush and then a straight

33:09.600 --> 33:17.120
is uh god this terminology is making my head spin what do you mean i have to learn one two three

33:17.120 --> 33:24.080
four five six seven eight nine nine new terminologies that's five too many right and then it goes

33:24.080 --> 33:28.160
straight and then it goes three oh no it doesn't go straight sugar because like that says 40 times

33:28.160 --> 33:37.920
three oh wait because it upgraded pairs oh okay okay okay i'm gonna have to i can't believe it i

33:37.920 --> 33:43.920
should have maybe played this a bit more offline but hey hope we did it we hand size minus one what do

33:43.920 --> 33:53.360
you mean minus oh but it reduces every round oh sugar okay i understand a bit more we got cash

33:53.360 --> 33:59.520
we got six dollars i hear the cogs turning very slowly this joker gains when any booster pack

33:59.680 --> 34:02.720
skipped like these

34:05.760 --> 34:09.200
two plus chips for every remaining card in the deck

34:11.200 --> 34:18.320
chips what's the check that two plus chips for every remaining card in the deck

34:19.280 --> 34:30.320
a hundred chips extra that seems tiny chips are blue the blue area yeah oh this is this good then

34:34.240 --> 34:40.240
multi is the red number wait that looks good then yeah that does look good hold on get that bad boy

34:40.240 --> 34:46.560
in there right i i need to do this in order or something so apply four multiplier to everyone

34:47.280 --> 34:55.680
and then add the blue so cute hearing you say oh sugar oh sugar i'm trying not to throw too much

34:55.680 --> 34:59.760
because i feel like i do it like every sentence and i'm like hmm shouldn't be doing that thank you

34:59.760 --> 35:11.760
broly legend for the tips actually wait this becomes useless it's gonna become useless so

35:11.760 --> 35:18.320
uh this joker gains a multiplier when you skip booster packs and these are booster packs

35:19.680 --> 35:23.360
uh i'm not really interested in tarot card choose to

35:24.240 --> 35:29.040
spectral cards oh i don't even have enough is spectral cards my planetarium ones

35:31.840 --> 35:36.080
right okay we can't do anything more this joker gains when you skip booster pack

35:36.080 --> 35:46.800
hmm let me learn from my mistakes okay this is my first run choose your next uh bind up the ante

35:46.800 --> 36:00.720
raises all blinds refreshes blinds all diamond cards are debuffed so i can't i don't get anything

36:00.720 --> 36:09.600
out of using them okay that's bad and not fun i have five discards

36:12.640 --> 36:15.920
wow i'm a bit perplexed on what i'm supposed to do

36:17.600 --> 36:24.000
diamond card fans see them diamond don't give points but it still holds their value

36:24.000 --> 36:25.600
like if i played two pairs

36:28.480 --> 36:34.160
40 times three and then what time 40 times seven

36:42.640 --> 36:48.160
i don't know the two tens would be more valuable would they it's still 40 times

36:49.200 --> 36:53.760
but the multiplier wouldn't apply scores no chips and all abilities are disabled on it so

36:53.840 --> 36:55.680
i should do double sevens with a queen

36:58.400 --> 37:01.680
i need to learn from my mistakes so i'm sorry if this is bad

37:02.400 --> 37:06.800
i need to learn from my mistakes so debuff doesn't apply but the two sevens do apply

37:07.440 --> 37:16.240
700 a thousand okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay double we did level up pairs

37:16.240 --> 37:21.120

to do the pairs right yeah another thousand okay we did it we did it we did it this uh i'm gonna

37:34.400 --> 37:39.120
have to sell this when it doesn't give me anything because i assume it's gonna actually reduce

37:40.720 --> 37:49.760

37:49.760 --> 37:54.160

wow okay okay that was a good choice doing whatever we did

43:09.280 --> 43:22.960
uh once you start getting multiple mullies rather than uh addictive additive then it starts to matter

43:22.960 --> 43:30.960
oh no yeah i don't think we're actually gonna win venus level up three of a kind i wouldn't mind that

43:33.120 --> 43:36.880
i don't need the tarot card one and two chance to create a tarot card when a booster putting up

43:37.520 --> 43:44.880
i'm happy to buy news venus i think we just need to level up like the base pair stuff

43:44.880 --> 43:52.320
and then it means no matter what we do we're getting like a massive um buff basically you haven't played

43:52.320 --> 44:04.000
three of a kind shit ah it's three of a kind not full house oh all heart cards are debuffed right

44:04.880 --> 44:10.240
okay technically that's three of a kind and then that becomes full house

44:12.240 --> 44:27.360
50 times five is 250 65 times six is lake 36 okay so it's better to play

44:27.600 --> 44:38.560
okay it's better to do that even though it's debuffed

44:39.760 --> 44:43.680
full house is there okay yes i was just confirming i was like try to do numbers

44:43.680 --> 44:47.600
really quickly i'm like hmm my brain actually doesn't know how to do numbers like this

44:47.600 --> 44:52.800
especially in the morning for the wee bit math don't you think okay that was good

44:53.760 --> 45:02.480
whoa we already did it whoa i got an achievement called anti up because the ante is now four

45:03.760 --> 45:09.200
joker unlocked ooh so you get to unlock more things ante off achievement unlocked

45:12.320 --> 45:19.360
Saturn level up astrae voucher one plus hand size i think well three and ten

45:19.360 --> 45:27.360
oh we have enough for both read trigger all cards and final hand over and what does that mean

45:28.640 --> 45:33.280
what does that mean i don't know what that means right we'll do hand size

45:34.720 --> 45:39.360
um after me measuring my hands on that one foot stream or that in real life

45:40.160 --> 45:46.240
oh no was that this room no it was an american sweet stream level up straight yeah sure whatever

45:46.240 --> 45:52.160
well we'll just level up basic stuff you know yeah cheeky cheeky level up is what i mean

45:54.240 --> 45:59.280
i can do 1000 calculations per second and they're all wrong you need to build up your

45:59.280 --> 46:04.240
interest it means if you're gonna lose it doubles the value of that hand have i got it oh i don't

46:04.240 --> 46:12.640
have enough ah well skip explained rerolls the boss blind all club cards are debuffed 10 000 though

46:17.840 --> 46:22.720
oh no i'm getting nervous i don't know if we're gonna win

46:24.800 --> 46:28.640
uh i see nothing

46:29.040 --> 46:37.040
five four three two and i don't have a one our king jack 10 98 sugar

46:40.640 --> 46:51.040
do do i play a double right if i play this pair and then use the rest to just throw away and reset the

46:51.760 --> 47:01.760
oh that doesn't really seem like the best idea discard okay discard take get rid of that and get

47:01.760 --> 47:08.640
rid of the nine and maybe we can either go high well okay okay okay okay all right let him get up let

47:08.640 --> 47:16.160
him get up we've got an ace and two pairs level three that looks that looks good and then we'll

47:16.160 --> 47:23.520
throw away one of the oh wait does someone say hearts no i don't have enough hearts okay uh i'll

47:23.520 --> 47:32.160
throw away that in case we do end up getting hearts and um that's two pairs truly wait you have a

47:32.160 --> 47:48.640
flush what's a flush what's a flush i do have five hearts i do i do oh i thought i didn't i checked

47:48.640 --> 47:56.400
i checked if i didn't have a flush ah right king queen jack 10 9 what more could you ask for

47:57.120 --> 48:03.600
oh i literally was like oh check if i have 10 eight five of the same but no i don't smile

48:04.720 --> 48:13.200
uh exhausting to watch don't you just want to take out all your pent up frustration out on me

48:13.200 --> 48:20.560
uh that's okay you can do it okay we got we got it we got we got it that's the main thing

48:20.800 --> 48:26.960
played cards with hearts give a three multiplier hermit doubles money

48:30.960 --> 48:32.720
choose one up to two joker cards

48:34.960 --> 48:39.520
a joker for four bucks actually doesn't seem like a bad idea

48:41.760 --> 48:45.680
a joker for two bucks doesn't seem for four bucks apologies

48:46.400 --> 48:52.880
10 if the hand contains a flush the joker gains three chips per discarded club card that's so

48:53.760 --> 48:54.320
specific

48:59.600 --> 49:03.040
10 plus multiplier is big though

49:06.720 --> 49:15.120
it's big but that if i discard a random club it'll give me three plus on the chip side

49:15.920 --> 49:16.400
i mean

49:19.360 --> 49:24.960
but that's 10 plus multiplier i pick the 10 okay thank you thank you you have influenced me right

49:24.960 --> 49:31.040
all the multipliers go together multiplier multiplier multiplier and then chips and then chips okay next

49:31.040 --> 49:42.080
round it rerolls the boss bane lane i i mean we've won with the debuff before so i don't see why

49:42.160 --> 49:43.440
we would need to change it

49:48.960 --> 49:51.360
trips check them

49:58.560 --> 49:59.840
so throw away these

50:02.080 --> 50:08.000
space space right surely that seems great fillers is much better than zero became

50:08.160 --> 50:11.520
so discard

50:18.960 --> 50:24.000
okay fill house let's go play hand play ball play hand

50:31.600 --> 50:31.840
oh

50:32.480 --> 50:38.320
oh i didn't make enough right okay okay okay

50:40.320 --> 50:42.480
who's that six five four three two

50:44.800 --> 50:52.320

50:55.360 --> 50:57.760
yeah okay we won we won straight flush we won

50:58.640 --> 51:04.240
six thousand for that okay that was good that was good i like that i like it do it again do it again

51:06.480 --> 51:08.720
very winnable straight flush in hand foggy

51:10.400 --> 51:16.800
is it rare oh no oh celeste deals up this joker gains a multiply every time the playing card

51:17.440 --> 51:21.840
a playing card is added to your deck that's uh a curious one

51:22.160 --> 51:28.560
iron two dollars pair discarded if no discards are used by the end of the

51:29.280 --> 51:38.400
no i'm a bit bye this joker gains multiply every time a playing card is added to your deck

51:42.320 --> 51:45.200
is that cute maybe

51:45.680 --> 51:49.600
uh

51:51.920 --> 51:55.120

52:15.200 --> 52:22.000
udonis mercuries just appear a flush four of a kind i don't really get that lot

52:22.720 --> 52:28.080
i think full house we seem to get a lot so i'm a bit biased towards earth if i'm being honest

52:29.040 --> 52:33.840
yeah that's a good that's a good buff i like that do that again do that again keep going

52:34.720 --> 52:44.720
um all club cards are debuffed we can do it though we can do it

52:48.720 --> 52:51.840
i've only got a dub a dub levy

52:51.920 --> 53:02.480

53:55.840 --> 54:01.680
to get it okay sorry my apologies my apologies seven would have made that higher in retrospect

54:02.160 --> 54:07.760
however uh we only need three thousand more so i think we've got it in the back question mark

54:09.280 --> 54:17.360
we can do a double and a double like that and then with the added extras

54:19.760 --> 54:25.600
uh let's just three four three we'll just throw away the eight while we're at it

54:25.760 --> 54:33.440

a pair a street a four of a kind a street

55:47.760 --> 55:50.240

55:52.400 --> 55:55.680
Saturn or Mars straight or four of uh some's a Saturn

55:56.880 --> 56:05.360

56:19.680 --> 56:27.280
i see a double bay i see a really weak double with these two that's so weak though

56:27.680 --> 56:39.200
i think it might be a discard round one two three one two three four five you're out try again

56:46.240 --> 56:49.680
no wait a minute that's not how it works is it

56:49.680 --> 56:51.680

57:02.640 --> 57:07.200
i always like satin's satin's not clicking what's not clicking what's not clicking

57:09.280 --> 57:10.480
okay we need 11

57:10.960 --> 57:19.760
oh we're gonna need some multiplier jokers to come in because yeah we're not really rolling

57:19.760 --> 57:27.920
and smoking six five four three so i don't have that have a jack double

57:32.320 --> 57:39.600

57:48.080 --> 57:50.320
i'm no i'm not playing with you you're too weak

57:53.920 --> 57:58.720
i cannot do fast math in my head oh we did it okay we did it in two rounds that's not bad

57:58.720 --> 58:02.240
i wouldn't mind like more multiplier jokers in place because

58:03.040 --> 58:09.040
yeah i'm getting a bit going shakie oh

58:09.600 --> 58:19.600
Uranus level up two pairs i play it so often i have enough for both i have enough for both

58:19.600 --> 58:24.720
i love it here i love the economy in belt row that's so good i'm sorry bilateral

58:25.360 --> 58:28.080
bilateral we love bilateral

58:30.720 --> 58:36.800
what right a straight oh so you have a kind oh i'm thinking straight again

58:38.320 --> 58:44.320
our flush daddy flushes often your anus is so back thank you

58:46.080 --> 58:51.200
belt row goes hard it's too late for this game but generally your top row other than score in

58:51.200 --> 58:56.400
the minimum points you need is a $25 for max interest your economy is super important in this

58:56.400 --> 59:03.680
game ah you mean any hold on to my my money's and not spend at all but but i'm a woman that's

59:03.680 --> 59:11.760
what we're supposed to do you tend to miss flushes straight would be better wait what you

59:11.760 --> 59:18.880
tend i miss flushes so straight would be better right i trust you i trust you okay so i need to

59:18.880 --> 59:26.640
hold money on my persons okay i will keep that in mind oh look it's the thing that's in Amy's

59:26.640 --> 59:31.520
bedroom i remember when the bedroom creator came back with that and i was like what the

59:31.520 --> 59:37.280
fuck is on the back of the room but uh it's like an actual thing next base edition shop

59:37.280 --> 59:48.160
joker is free and becomes negative negative is one joker slot but that means i'm allowed

59:48.160 --> 59:51.120
a six card is that no good

59:54.560 --> 01:00:01.680
that's so powerful yeah the devil is actually ah yeah yeah uh it's like i already knew you were

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:07.440
going to say it like i said i'm on jokes your pair joker is negative

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.840
oh

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.320
does it mean like very very good if you're strong enough to skip

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:27.520
you already have a six joker slot oh i do and then this will give me a seventh

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:36.560
as long as the card is a negative but also for each okay fuck it we ball this is literally a

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:43.760
gamble game was gamble cards drawn face down after each hand is bro where's my hangman

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:50.560
does that mean what i think it means the cards are going to flip over on me so i'm getting a

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:57.760
piece of paper right now i'm not i'm not going in this blind okay the fish more like the fish

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.600
don't ever give me this mission again right okay

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:07.760
i see fuck all

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:21.680
okay i'm gonna have to ditch so we have an ace oh no pencil oh pencil please work with me

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:30.160
i don't have a pen oh i do have a pen i'm a weak fiver okay i'm gonna keep right we're gonna ditch

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:37.440
all you guys i know i do have a pair they're buying that leveled up we have an ace we have a 10

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:45.360
we have an eight and a seven surely this is gonna go well the new cards are drawn face down

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:54.800
i'll be shooting blind shut no way that's not even possible wait i can play this do i want to play it

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.400
i think you're fucked

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:08.000
did i just play this for points do not play the pair no no okay

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:13.440
you can use the shorthand discard good okay discard thank you thank you read thing

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:23.120
right we have an ace we have a jack we have a 10 an eight i have two sevens a five a three in a

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:33.200
two what is this hand look this is the worst i just want riddities honestly these are so weak

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.800
i think i want to go high and just get rid of all the low you know that

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:44.160
keep the sevens sevens are good

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:54.320
you can play less than you can play less than the five if i want to

01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:02.320
you can dig for a flush i that's something throw the threes the five and twos but keep the sevens

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:07.360
okay it's not gonna be much of a shuffle that's my only

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.720
are you fucking fishing me i think i'm gonna have to play a double

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:21.120
i think i'm gonna have to do it so i've got an ace i've got a jack i've got a 10 i've got an eight

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:26.560
and i've got six yeah i think this is what i'm gonna throw away the six just because i don't want low

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:34.800
um boy thank you for the five gifted memberships congrats to the people who caught it with your

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:44.960
face in your face uh yegachad you've got lots of discards left i know but i get nervous i'm not

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:51.120
gonna do it in time look at her getting addicted to gamble i've become the very thing i swore to destroy

01:03:51.360 --> 01:04:00.800
i've got oh fuck it i need to earn some points fuck it ace jack 10 and eight

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.440
fuck it fuck it

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.360
oh puss that was

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:18.800
hello

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.320
is this probability

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:32.640
hah wouldn't it be oh i can't even get a royal flush that's not how it works

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:44.800
um it's sorted by rank okay so we know these are lower than eight and these are higher than

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:52.480
that use the sort button that's already at rank you can sort by suit

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.400
oh no

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:04.000
wait so that can give me a three suit no but you can't do that

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:09.760
oh man now it's a puzzle game bruv bruv

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:19.280
that was doing so well on this run but i don't think we're gonna make it you can discard the

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:27.600
face down cards wait they'll come back the cards will come back viewable i don't want to get rid

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:31.760
of these because they seem high discard all the face done

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:38.400
okay

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:52.560
it's very likely this is a king right if it's not we've got a double joker

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:58.160
is that how probability works

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:06.240
male's camera thank you for coming to member i appreciate it this come on

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:15.280
unbless we just played mega safe and do two ace and two pair that'll give me what 5k again

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.680
i'm needing a christmas miracle

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:28.800
no gamba all right gamba right what did i do ace king queen

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:37.040
oh that's not what i did at all right i can put down that card because i know for a fact either

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:42.160
way i've covered the thing so this has to be a king surely this is a king

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:55.200
oh we did it we did it gamba paid off we did it probability oh wait we only got 4k for that

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:56.560
that was so big though

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.160
that was so big

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:15.840
um i don't know if we're winning this one i think wait hold on rank if i do it by rank

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:23.040
these are all high again so the probability of a double riko thank you for the five gifted

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:30.080
memberships congrats to those who caught it with your face in your face that's totally not the

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:35.680
blue joker is coughing up blood at the moment is it this one

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:46.400
uh am i hemorrhaging the blue joker's um help yeah congrats on the memory thank you again

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:53.520
riko and boy for all the gifted memberships right if i do it by rank these two are whoa

01:07:53.760 --> 01:08:01.360
what if you want to like number them out the wazoo oh then you can about this

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:14.960
uh i don't i'm not even looking right 10 and ace there's no way the odds are the game

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:18.560
the odds are the game actually can't give me another

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:23.520
flush

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:36.080
um can it give me a flush do we just gamble again but we're not making enough we're only

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.720
getting 5k per round i've got two more hands

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:48.160
oh math jumpscare honestly uh you know what we're playing a gamba game it's very unlikely

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:52.560
we're going to win this round so you we might as well go all in

01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:58.960
how

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:08.880
how i'm not lucky like this i mean we're not going to make it because we don't have

01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:13.280
um

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:20.640
math jumpscare this is impossible i think i'm just gonna have to discard

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:28.400
i don't want to discard the high though if i discard oh i don't want to discard the high

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:34.080
this is most likely a double nine here so these are useless but i don't want to take them out of

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:43.520
my deck clearly there's another straight there can there be there can't be oh

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:52.240
fuck it did we just do this and see if we get any like thingies i don't think we can win we're

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:59.200
we're so blind discard everything and pray yolo yolo i think just send it what we got

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.600
oh we could add a triple nine oh no i don't have enough good jokers for unfortunately

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:13.200
that was a good run though for that was a good run best hand that was so good

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:23.120
oh no were you bluffing too sometimes that is so good defeated by the fish yeah definitely

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:32.560
not wanting to go against the fish again that was rough right new run blue deck unlocked discover

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:39.680
at least 20 items from your collection one plus hand every round joker unlocked defeat a boss

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:50.960
blind in one hand without using any discards um i'm not sure i'm that good reach anti level

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:59.680
joker turret planet and spectral cards may appear multiple times um i had pretty bad luck with

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:12.800
jokers okay okay uh what what is this i'll just do basic red deck i don't oh seeded run i thought

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.720
this had speed run i was like steady on it i don't think i can do it speed thank you for making it

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:22.800
hard for me to work smile i didn't say anything bad i've never even said anything bad this stream

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:27.520
thank you really legend for the tip i've never even said anything bad this stream i've been good

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:34.480
doubles your money like that you can hold right i definitely need to hold on to my money a bit

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:44.080
better so gender norms you need a back off right now ace jack ten nine what two pairs i feel like

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:49.680
because it's like just the start we can kind of you know piss arse about i think

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:56.400
yeah we've got like three rounds we can we can play low games okay we can play

01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:06.080
low games like low rounds it's not it is not um bad right nine ten jack i wouldn't mind getting a king

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:09.440
gonna be honest if we get a king

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:16.800
unless we get an eight then it would be a lower flush but

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:22.240
fuck it give me a hand uh uh

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:32.480
i'm not gonna have to play pairs shut up to all my pairs but the main thing was no economy yeah

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:36.480
you want to try and win in one hand because each time gives you an extra oh

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:43.840
keep an eight in case of an eight yeah i totally kept the eight what you're talking about what do

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:49.920
you mean you didn't see it it just walked away i know i should probably go for a king but

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:58.560
you know what it's the first round i think we win by default just because of how low the the

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:05.920
blind is it's so low like it's we can't really lose this famous last words famous last words we

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:12.800
can't lose this uh wait wait can i just keep playing pairs or am i actually gonna lose in the first

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:17.600
round please don't that's that's actually embarrassing please don't actually make me lose in the first

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:28.560
round okay it's fine it's fine we're here we're here um well just get rid of all these then

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:35.440
it's fine it's fine yeah there's see look we got a little triple oh we got a little full house

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:42.160
moment please see it's fine no no i i don't think i can lose on this the very first level i think

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:48.480
it's hard to lose there's three good weeks high straight high flush medium full house

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:54.960
yeah you guys are kind of i'm gonna lie reeflings i didn't realize your past time

01:13:55.520 --> 01:14:00.720
was gambling gambling's quite bad didn't didn't you know gamble bad

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:08.080
see that hand size helps i don't want it

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:13.200
i'm gonna go and keep my economy

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:17.040
skip playing double your money no that's not useless for me

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:24.800
then save your money save your money i may quickly make a cup of tea after we lose this one

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:29.840
because there's no way i'm gonna be smart enough to actually win i refuse to believe

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.440
i refuse right what we got

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:45.280
after losing many hours to this game i found sticking to one type of hand and destroying cars

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:49.920
so don't match it with the devil arcana or other means it's a good way to help build a

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:56.640
consistent strategy for collector jokers are jokers locked for me thank you jobon

01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:04.560
brian we love betting on mortgage no stroney i'll catch up later glad you liked my idea for the

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:10.240
mercy collab earlier go conquer big no we're not conquering big gang but thank you job

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:18.560
no go job no go job no go that sounds like an ace of martyr job

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:27.520
thank you for the 20 um yes thank you for your patience for watching me play this for the first

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:32.480
time i did watch another streamer play it for like two hours and i was like yeah yeah i can play

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:37.920
this game on stream mihu as soon as i hit go live completely forget all of the terminology

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.640
because you guys are like yeah flush are straight and all that and i'm like

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:48.880
i remember i remember that a phil house is going to do a three and a double four of a kind is well

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:57.360
four of a kind straight flush i need to get straight and flush flush is all the same but

01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:02.880
straight flush is all the same in the same suit okay i just need to get my head right about flush

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:09.520
and straight flush the toilet because it's all the same color that's how i'm going to remember it

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:13.840
no i don't care if that's disgusting flush the toilet because it's all the same color

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:20.560
and straight numbers okay that's how i'll remember it when you guys are talking

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:28.720
that's how i'm going to remember it this is where i make my stand oh no keep the eight

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:30.480
people say keep the eight so i'll keep the eight

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:39.040
we've got a duplicate right we'll play the double oh wait i don't have a joker in place i may actually

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:48.240
lose this what so i just bend these i'll just bend these ones okay it's fine oh that's what i

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:56.640
wanted to see right what can we do we can do ten jack king queen ace let's go

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:05.520
flush like my whole face flushes with red when i see you okay that's probably a nicer way to see it

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:11.200
than a flush the toilet because it's all the same color half that man that's probably a nicer way to

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:23.120
put it uh wait again more on core on core on core straight on core it feels good man

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:32.080
okay i'll take it hopefully we can get a joker for multipliers in the shop because the the joker

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:41.360
cards are kind of definitely maker break the jokers are maker break one and two no don't care

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:48.240
um this joker gains three multi with any booster pack that skipped

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.760
i mean i skip booster packs or is this a booster pack even oh i guess that's a booster pack so it

01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:05.040
doesn't count okay we'll just do celestia molest sorry um my brain just wanted to run

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:15.040
right a straight flush is when it's on in the same suit which is so rare three of a kind

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:22.240
isn't that rare four of a kind i think three of a kind oh wait but am i actually gonna do three of

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:27.520
a kind normally if i've got three of a kind i'm able to do a full house

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:35.680
intrusive thoughts are coming out i can't believe it hi stroney belcher is my favorite game hope you

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:42.080
like it i am so sorry for the gameplay you're about to witness i can only apologize it's my four of a

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:48.320
kind is also super hard three is more realistic yeah i um i'm biased towards venus because it's so

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:54.640
unlike straight flush is so unlikely and four of a kind i i don't think i've actually played one

01:18:54.640 --> 01:19:00.960
four of a kind yet um so we'll just upgrade the most likely we've still got ten dollars in hand

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:06.880
so surely that means my economy is good right right all heart cards are debuffed i don't think

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:13.680
we're gonna do this we don't have a joker on the playing field yet we don't have one joker oh there's

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:19.040
our triple oh baby a triple we're gonna throw away these and play three of a kind

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.800
i'm gonna throw these away play three of a kind

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:29.200
right we're already halfway there let them get up let them get up let them get up right we've got

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:39.120
let's go that's how it works right we already did it okay we didn't even need a joker but i do

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:46.880
want a joker i do okay i really would like a joker please okay that was good that was good

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:51.760
spectral cards can shape your deck to increase the likelihood of four of a kind oh i don't know you

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:59.040
could do that uh the cards are in my favor and before i have a really good lucky seed then i

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:07.120
mess it up i went nine for that one two dollars interest for every five dollars in my thingy i

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:14.880
get an extra dollar that's good don't feel bad enjoy watching you learn this is a game where it gets

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:22.400
easier the longer you play or at least you understand it better oh thank you for your patience jubo no

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:30.400
i can't say this reptiles fast thank you for the tip again yes and thank you everyone for your

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:35.440
patience i really enjoy being i get full house often

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:43.920
i get full house often yankers i get full house often please

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:52.160
yes no i'm actually really thankful for it because like i don't get a lot of time to play well this

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:59.600
sense well now that i'm a vtuber i get plenty of time to play games for the first time but before i

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:04.720
didn't hardly have every time like to like just be late i don't want spectral packs we'll play

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:11.040
like i just never had time for it but now i have like all the time to like like look at these games

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:15.040
and be like you know what i'm actually interested in playing that game this game that game right i've

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:22.560
got eight now i want to throw a nine away that seems a bit harsh i'm a better throw at the

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:25.920
pair away but i feel like the nine's just randomly sitting there

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:34.160
what what do my my trusted advisors the reeflings advise

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:39.760
your hard work paid off by the way have you seen that one banana game that's trending on stream

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:46.960
no someone says keep the name the message after it chuck the nine wait what's the banana game

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:53.280
Danny to look it up you could also keep the clubs oh you're right

01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:00.160
surely we will score another club

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:06.560
surely we will score another club

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:15.200
i'm gonna regret doing the club route you know that i'm gonna regret them can i just play that

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:23.520
it's only gonna give me what like less than a hundred if i play that

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:29.760
if i play the just play the two pairs okay okay okay okay we'll play the two pairs

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:36.400
and we will throw away the three i'm gonna try and throw away the four and whatever hand i get

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:43.040
next as well because it ain't whatever we tried to do any time it's no happening so might as well

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:51.760
try and get rid of the low so we can have a hand fuller we have a triple and we've got the freaking

01:22:53.040 --> 01:23:01.040
buff of it i don't have a double no yeah okay and then we'll just throw away the six and the four

01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:09.280
yeah that seems right yeah yeah i'm getting MLG right we do need a joker though i would

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:17.280
very much like a joker joker joker if you'd like to show up a decent joker um we do have

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:26.000
three discards we have a double of a we do not have any suits coming into play i think i'm happy

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.400
to just throw those away wow

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:40.080
wow i mean might as well just throw those away because we've got a queen to follow up right after

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:44.720
don't mind if i do don't mind oh wait it's a full house

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:54.400
wait ace is standing is anything for a full house i'm oh wait all i had to do is play double queen

01:23:54.400 --> 01:24:00.800
i'm sorry i'm but we did it we won i'm so sorry i apologize wow we got three extra dollars because

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:07.520
of how much money on my hand i'm sorry but we did it anyway that's the main thing oh my gosh

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:16.720
oh my god the game is tempting me so hard right now i'm so i'm so tempted to go out

01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:23.280
the inner inner women was it do they call it retail therapy the retail therapy is going

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:28.640
hard right now please please let me cannot buy them all please please reeflings let me buy all the

01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:35.200
four of them please for me i've been such a good streamer i've been streaming everything

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:42.560
no don't say no to me say please i said please

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:49.280
very concentrate on a specific hand are you serious oh come on let me go for it it's retail

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:54.480
therapy right i'm going for it i've been a good girl sorry but most removed like oh i need to

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:58.960
break streaming so stressful uh no i need to play more with the reeflings they need to hold my hand

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:09.440
through games fuck off move aside i need to keep streaming okay so let's still pack right full house

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:18.720
high card i never play high card three of a kind or full house full house if we invest in earth

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:23.760
then full house offers more than what a base three of a kind can offer anyway because you're

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:27.280
getting extra two thingies in it

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:35.280
a fucking earth card desune

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:46.080
oh no i've only got nine so i'm only gonna get one dollar the fact i don't even have a joker yet

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:55.360
is shocking create up to two jokers must have room create but does it mean use the two jokers

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:03.120
i might have to do that if it means it gives me two jokers i think we might have to

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:06.640
do

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:10.800
yeah skip skip okay right give us these jokers because we need it

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:13.760
whoa one of them's turned off are you okay

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:24.000
oh person 20 multiplier if the hand contains uh three of a kind okay

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:34.800
50 chips if the plate is a pair yeah we needed something of this nature so maybe we'll go for

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:44.880
trip check on boys um triple triple triple we've got a duble of a but it's two i don't want such a

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:51.360
low duble of a it might not be obvious but you can sell jokers if you don't want them and i'll

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:56.320
sell them once we get like better things to replace them with not three of a kind

01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:02.000
only if you play three cards or less wouldn't that be three of a kind then i'm so sorry

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:11.920
contains a pair a pair contains three of a kind it's three or less cards so a pair in a single

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:15.920
card would also work to activate you

01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:28.160
do i discard you can play a pair playing a pair of two with one of them debuffed is like

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:36.720
rough though i think i'm gonna throw all these away play the twos oh no you say play the twos

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:45.440
do it let's just play the twos see the power okay reef flings i'll see the power we're playing

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:58.720
three so that should activate we're debuffed on the two debuff right that was the weakest thing

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:02.240
i have ever witnessed in the game said aye that's fine

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:09.760
whoa so if i do this i win

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:22.880
whoa jokers are maker break holy crap jokers are maker break

01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:31.600
okay and we get a little bonus dollar as well yes we did so we got eight payout that's good

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:38.640
oh my god the game is tempting me stop it what is this one consumable slot no i don't really mess

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:49.280
with that high card i never play a flush oh it takes me just under 15 it takes me just under

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:54.880
15 so i'll miss out the three dollar bonus but i want to i want to try the buffoon pack

01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:01.760
choose one up to two jokers oh fuck it we ballin right let me get this one and then we'll try the

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:13.440
buffoon as well oh my tummy hurt am i experiencing a hunger i might be adds double the rank of the

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:24.560
hand to multi to do jog oil change karate eat candy ruminate earn four dollars if poker hand

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:33.440
is a two-payer poker hand changes at the end not sure about that one add is double the value

01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:41.040
the left one's pretty good i am inclined to also want to pick the left one the fist okay please

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:49.280
fist me okay thank you i'm sorry um and we will get two dollars per every round played

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:57.120
and just to add double the rank on the lowest so that's a multiplier so we're going to have

01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:09.760
the multipliers together and then the chips that side um upgrade high card by three levels

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:14.400
but i don't play high card i never play high card

01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:22.000
i feel like high card is like a hail me unless wait hold on hold on

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:29.600
that 20 multiplier would come into play if i played an ace like an ace on its own

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:38.480
hold on a minute hold on a minute this might actually be worth it if i'm not mistaken

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:48.800
this 20 multiplier as well as high card it won't help with the pair of joker as it won't scale

01:30:48.800 --> 01:31:04.960
very long yeah but no chips oh true right let's focus on duplicates and trips okay we'll focus on

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:13.440
doubles and trips thank you for your your um right we already have a double ace if i play double

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:23.440
ace and throw away the five with it add the double to the lowest rank held in hand to the

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:29.280
multiplier so it has to be a two which is fine i'll take a two uh right we'll get rid of the five

01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:34.080
just to clear a few things up in the hand don't forget to check your run info why yes of course

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:42.160
so two pairs is what my strongest contender but the multiplier isn't actually that big

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:50.320
oh sorry my apologies four full house is my biggest earner we are starting to level up

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:59.520
quite nicely i'm enjoying it uh i think we'll throw away the five um

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:11.200
yeah sorry this multiplier comes in very strongly if i do the five option skipping around is very

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:15.040
impactful because not only do you lose money but you also lose your chance at seeing the shop as well

01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:22.240
oh okay okay maybe that's why i was like hardly see any jokers um jay to the torn card do you have

01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:30.160
a kind as your hail mary full of grace someone sent me um something on marsh mallow and it's like

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:41.440
hail strongy my comments with you what how we've already won that was just one goal and we get an

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:48.800
extra two dollars and remaining we got eight for that that's fantastic oh no i'm getting four of a

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:57.840
kind i'd never get a chance to play four of a kind though what are you play aces give 20 oh wow

01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:04.080
four multiplier as well as 20 chips

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:14.320
oh i'd buy the spectral pack and nothing else are you spectral pack player i'm only celestial

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:19.840
him in the planet booster still leaves you at 10 so i would still get double

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:26.880
you're right i'm going to do celestial pack and joker this joker if he comes in correctly

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:32.800
so that's a multiplier so i want it to be in front of this guy

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:39.040
and then that's a little thing on top

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:44.560
wow okay okay let's let's see what we've got in here

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:55.280
we have a high card i don't play a straight flush i don't and a straight straight definitely straight

01:33:55.920 --> 01:34:01.520
but a straight flush is next to impossible odds i'll take a straight though

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.400
right let's do it let's see what we're up against

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:16.640
3000 or gives a mega arcane pack which i am not fussed for personally three aces is the ultimate

01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:22.160
hand for you now speaking of aces i got nothing

01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:31.600
double nine audit is it like is it valuable enough or just throw all these away

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:35.920
would double nine be valuable enough

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:42.720
pair yeah i'm like honestly and then i'll throw away the two just so it's not in the way

01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:49.440
let's see what let's see let's see what happens if i do just double nine what kind of monies do we get

01:34:51.280 --> 01:35:02.160
okay why it's so big so if i get to play an ace it also a double ace well we'll do double 10 and

01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:03.840
then that's what's done already

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:10.240
we have made pairs so OP honestly

01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:16.080
literally have made pairs so OP we don't even have to do anything

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:19.040
oh this is so good

01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:27.520
oh we got extra four bucks as well four and then remaining hands

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:36.320
ah yes okay so that so if i'd managed to do it in one i get three max dollars and if i keep a lot more money on me i get more

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:45.120
okay okay okay okay i'm getting tempted though joker tarot planet and spectral cards can appear multiple times

01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:48.160
don't care one in four chance for a holographic

01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:51.920
but it can fail

01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:05.120
if it fails i waste three bucks but i'll still be but i'll make it back naturally complete in the round

01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:13.120
so is it really gambling is it really gamble if i don't actually lose out on the money in the next round

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:22.480
the wheel mathematically never go for the wheel but technically i make it back by default so it's not

01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:26.480
really gambling it's not really gambling

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:32.320
whoa it put on the best one

01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:40.240
it put on the best one streamer lock streamer lock streamer lock identified

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:46.480
play only one hat okay i can throw a ton of stuff away though

01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:50.640
wait i make 2000 with a low pair anyway

01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:00.800
okay let's throw all this i saw away i just need an ace that's it move one

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:11.040
move one that's it that's all we had to do even though the game said play one hand

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.800
easy peasy leaven squeezy

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:21.120
wow 6000 for double aces

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:22.800
wow

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:31.280
oh my goodness we got five bucks for that and we got our three bucks back so our gamble heck and

01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:40.480
paid off on that we're now in the 23 what's this v-roll boss blind one time but it's cost

01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:48.880
to do it right what are you hundred chips if played hand contains a three of a kind

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:57.200
that's actually not bad for our build but we are going for pair a pair yeah we are going for

01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:10.880
a pair should have upgraded the pairs i don't really go for flushes maybe there's a pair in here

01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:18.800
gamble for the pair what's in here let me see a pair so i want to level up pair now don't i

01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:24.800
buy or three of a kind pair or three of a kind

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:38.960
pair or three of a kind pairs i know the pairs are just so op you want all the mercuries got it

01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:45.440
loud and clear loud and clear mercuries are the way it go right right right right what are you a

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:55.680
flush i don't even need you anymore do i know now this one does have my interest because there may

01:38:55.680 --> 01:39:10.800
be situations where a triple will come up i'm tempted i'm tempted arcane for easy win choose

01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:15.440
choose one of the three tarot cards to be used might as well seems good right okay

01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:22.320
that's our five jokers which i'm happy with so if it's a pair i get 50 if it's three of a kind i

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:27.120
get 100 so these actually conflict a little bit maybe that wasn't the wisest idea

01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:37.680
oh dear maybe i shouldn't have done that you know what you live in your learn let's go next

01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:47.520
you live in your learn 5000 create creates two jokers to choose from though oh that's juicy

01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:55.600
uh three of a kind gives you 150 because both of the jokers apply oh wait i don't want new jokers then

01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:03.840
uh you don't have room yes i would have to sell so let's not do that let's not skip around

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:10.080
we'll also get three bonus for how much we won we won already did we win already

01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:24.160
play did we get 5000 just we do because we got 6000 last time

01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:35.680
seven thousand when we won first hand okay okay i like this game this is getting

01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:43.280
ye this is getting jesse look we got an extra six dollars bonus i was gonna skip that as well

01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:50.320
thank goodness i didn't choose one of the playing cards to add to your dick re-triggers all the cards

01:40:50.320 --> 01:41:01.840
i don't really quite comprehend at random he can apply a multi depending on what time he's putting

01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:16.240
re-triggers good with your joker whenever the fire rises you know i feel like i would have

01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:26.320
to sell that one though for him yes that makes sense to sell him in order of a higher molly

01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:36.400
yeah okay get rid of him add you you crazy card you i'll pop you right there because

01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:41.840
these are both chips and these are mullies oh wait does he need to go in front of him

01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:50.800
because he does chips as well right what is a jumbo saleth pack i am very happy to see you

01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:57.840
whatever you are it just means there's a lot in it mercury um i'm going for you i'm all in on mercury

01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:00.480
yep all for you baby

01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:13.280
oh i doubled it up twice that's fantastic okay order doesn't matter with these particular

01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:21.600
jokers okay the blank gives a dollar pair unused discard this run will give 29 bucks

01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:25.600
i get 29 dollars with a skip this

01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:36.400
take the 29 and run that's worth it okay don't have to tell oh wait but i don't have a shop

01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:48.720
but that's okay because cards played previously this ante are debuffed so just do aces once

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:54.480
ah wait no

01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:09.600
my aces don't count what do i do uh it's just two aces that are due discard for pairs right

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:11.920
i'll go for high pairs i know that's one there but

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:17.360
discard again

01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:26.080
discard and triangle for higher pairs up here that seems like the smartest thing i can do

01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:28.800
yeah that

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:33.600
i want another ace to appear

01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:40.640
not me being able to do a royal flush oh sorry that's a straight my apologies

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:50.320
do i get actually you know what get rid of this ace that doesn't work and then when the double ace

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:57.760
comes through that'll be better so this isn't a lose lose this is still a good move it gets rid

01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:02.400
of all these cards and it gives me a higher chance to roll an ace that isn't affected no

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:13.360
no wait no yep discard the other ace just discard the ace and use a regular ace

01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:19.840
just keep the ace level three straight is good though yeah

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:24.800
better to discard the two

01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:34.480
oh i'm conflicted on what to do i guess straight doesn't work with your jokers though but i do have

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:41.840
that no there's straight is good oh fuck it sorry i don't know if i'm gonna mess this up i don't

01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:46.320
know if i should get rid of this ace and then in hopes for an ace that isn't debuffed though

01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:49.760
straight doesn't work with any of my jokers though

01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:51.040
mm-hmm

01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:58.720
mate i'm gonna do this to clear my hand i have three more yeah i do have three more turns i'm

01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:08.480
doing this to clear the hand on purpose okay on purpose i am clearing the hand i got five thousand

01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:14.000
that was decent if i can just get there see boom what do i get if i do double ace

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:23.360
uh-huh let them numbers keep going up baby uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:30.480
wow okay it worked it worked it worked it worked it worked it worked and you got any

01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:38.800
doubt or wait so if i have 45 in my pocket how much bonus that yet oh max of five which is 25

01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:49.920
dollars still low um planet cards appear two times more frequently yes i want to upgrade this shiz

01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:58.400
out of my uh planet cards so yes i will take you what i do with you planet merchant redeemed yes

01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:05.920
what a okay i don't put it anymore try a death card select two cards convert the left into the

01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:13.120
right that is confusing but i will take your word for it uh choose one up to three tarot cards

01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:19.360
to use immediately maybe if we get the wheel of fortune because there's no point in being less

01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:28.960
than 25 so i'm down for the wheel of fortune gamble will we try that tarot is so good let's see open

01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:33.680
huh

01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:42.320
creates up to two random playa planet cards must have room for a planet card

01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:46.800
i don't think a planet card means what i think it means

01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:53.760
compare up to three selected cards to hearts i mean i could do a straight well i don't want

01:46:53.840 --> 01:47:00.640
a straight flush i've got triple there use the death card now convert two cards

01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:05.440
select two cards convert the left card into what the right card is

01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:09.360
oh no planet no not yet

01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:20.320
astronomy didn't have another stream in 10 minutes oh my god i have to do membership

01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:26.560
somewhere right we're gonna lose anyway but it's fine use the high priestess okay

01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:35.040
we got earth for it a full house but we don't even i mean sure use it why not

01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:42.240

01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:51.040
no worries you can use death and chariot in the middle of a run to get ace cards

01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:54.000
shop is better

01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:00.720

i can't use that i must be able to use it in the game

01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:17.680
playing pierce fish is pretty easy okay right so i play yeah i'm to play it surely surely i have

01:49:51.680 --> 01:50:00.080
this is use can't use it select two cards and convert the left card into the right card

01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:12.640
wait that would make it a king then on the ace in the three wait like that and then death use on

01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:20.400
three convert your three to an ace you can drag cards around what i don't even know you can do that

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
so then use on three

01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:35.040

01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:43.520

01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:53.120
oh i can't wait you enhance i enhance you yay i've got a steel card what does it do

01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:57.440
eleven chips and a multiplier world this card stays in hand

01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:02.240
oh you do we hold back i didn't know what she did i thought it was a good thing

01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:12.000
you now have five aces in the deck stop wait that's so good i want to convert everything into aces

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:22.080
now ten thousand oh come on we were 100 chips no 92 chips less i just play this get out of the way

01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:31.840
just play this you could have enhanced and then copied yes we are learning we are learning

01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:36.960
but we did it that's the main thing we got our cheeky bonus five dollars as well so

01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:47.040
planetarium upgrades are getting pretty pretty on the house um convert increase the rank of

01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:53.680
two selected cards the phone now choose one of up to the cards

01:51:56.320 --> 01:52:03.600
increase the rank of up to two selected cards by one can i put that on aces strength on

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:09.840
and turn kings into aces as well stop i'm gonna cream is that real

01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:21.120
that re-roll could upgrade kings to aces okay i am learning i am tempted to re-roll honestly

01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:29.840
if we if going below 25 doesn't count then okay plow no i don't play high cards that was rubbish

01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:35.760
the joker gains three trips pair discarded diet that nah right okay that was always the money

01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:45.120
we are not rolling again uh no i do not need that or do i do i need that for the fish draw

01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:53.840
cards face down after each hand played i need that for the next round to ensure i win

01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:05.440
shouldn't need to skip you only play pairs so no it's not worth it okay right if i have a king

01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:14.720
i can upgrade it oh yeah if i have a king no three of a king bum bum bum

01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:19.680
nice and easy straight thief for king right away play hand

01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:27.440
bum bum bum bum bum and then i'll upgrade a king if i get a king in my inventory my inventory

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:32.160
are my inventory didi you're in my laboratory

01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:41.440
i've got an ace so throw everything else away i need a king or an ace and then

01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:52.080
oh well that's it already i think so yeah that's it we did it okay we are we actually on a winning

01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:57.120
streak hold on a minute the the membership asmar is delayed we're actually on a win streak here

01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:01.600
give me a second let me cook let me cook we actually might be winning this somehow

01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:08.320
i actually don't know how the game like what the end in game is is that the ante is eight i think

01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:15.920
eleven dollars feels good man what we got all cards are considered face cards what does that

01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:24.880
even mean can dig for kings with the fish she's getting addicted me addicted you have to be eight

01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:29.520
boss fights beating ante eight is the end so we're already halfway through

01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:35.360
should be able to uh with when all the kings become aces you can one shot give me mercury

01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:37.360
mercury mercury shit

01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:44.960
maybe i'll just put it on saturn then and then a straight would be a hill mary

01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:52.000
oh dear well we tried yeah well straight's getting pretty big um

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:06.320
some jokers care about face cards it's a buff face cards don't matter with my jokers though

01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:13.440
she's hooked the fish is on the hook so if i refresh it doesn't refresh the celestia pack

01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:20.240
i'll just use this right i'm not afraid re-rolls don't don't do anything right level up my king

01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:29.920
level up my king as long as i roll the fucking king right increase the rank of a card

01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:37.920
increase the rank of up to two selected cards by one so do it on the eight as well while i'm at it

01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:49.760
you can do two kings so get rid of all this you can upgrade two kings discard from more kings yes sir

01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:58.320
say no more right okay slight kings strength use on the kings please

01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:13.520
oh it's a good day down in philadelphia are we looking good discard the law three aces let's go

01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:21.520
let's go oh show me what we're getting maybe can we do it in one can we do it in one

01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:23.760
oh

01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:40.080
shit what i really don't want to lose against the fish seven aces are now in a deck though

01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:50.080
discard for pairs i don't want to discard the high though because they could be a

01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:54.880
are you sure discard the face up everyone saying discard for pairs

01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:03.920
i'm worried about them being aces and like throwing that away

01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:11.280
i don't know if i discard the lower cards right let me discard these ones

01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:16.880
and then that pushes me to most likely have high

01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:27.360
can i test it right i'm going to test what we get if i do tens okay because ten is safe

01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:32.800
let me just test it out let me see how it goes what happens if i do tens

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:42.480
a classic ten five thousand okay so we've won if i do nine i have two more rounds so please

01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:46.400
don't worry if i'm completely messing up i have two more rounds i think we've done it and we've

01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:53.840
got past the fish fish v fish who's gonna win i think i win yes i win right get right take that

01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:58.960
take that shove your blind up your arse okay we did it that's the main thing that's the most

01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:06.400
important thing is that we did it okay the fish is dead and we got five bucks i'll take it right

01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:11.280
what we're looking at enhances two selected cards to lucky cards one and five chance to

01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:17.680
multiplier one plus hand size i don't think i want to give anything up

01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:24.320
the misprint is so valuable i don't want to give them up

01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:27.760

can't add the jack on the right or skip purple jack is good what do you do

02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:18.080
creates a tar card when discarded

02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:21.600
um

02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:27.760

02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:33.520
well that was shite i thought i was gonna re-roll the packs right i need to remember it doesn't

02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:39.120
re-roll the packs chips for each remaining card and deck no right okay let's go next let's go next

02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:45.360
tar free the tarot cards and the real tarot cards include tar

02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:54.800
20k next base edition shop joker has a free foil inside but i don't even know if i want to

02:00:54.800 --> 02:01:00.240
take it so i'm not interested so my king

02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:11.680
no i upgraded one king but one king acts like an ace now enhances two selected cards to lucky car

02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:18.720
okay actually that's like a really big gamble for that one right let's get rid of you because

02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:25.760
these are offering me nothing these are offering me nothing okay just like that and then apply the

02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:32.880
tarot card to these aces for the hell of it and then we'll see what happens whoa they're

02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:36.080
tattered now yeah let's go play hands

02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:48.080
is the card gonna do a re-animation if i win the

02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:52.160
odds oh no how good your beat is

02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:59.920
i'm gonna have to upgrade mercury if i'm wanting to keep up with how big these um

02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:07.040
blinds are getting lucky didn't proc but next time next time okay i'll just throw the jacks i think

02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:13.200
they're gonna be fine they are worn out that's what makes them lucky oh you got 20 plus multiplier

02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:22.720
from them oh i did not see oh i'm gonna start lagging behind if i don't get some upgrades

02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:27.360
that took me three three rounds to get

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:37.040
i'm gonna have to start spending at the shop the shop's gonna have to start giving me the goods

02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:43.680
because that was quite a few attempts my economy is high so that's giving me the extra five every

02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:49.280
time which is good not gonna lie it is the first girl's addicted to gamble he's the most

02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:54.800
i'm probably more than one free reroll in the shop yeah bloody like that wouldn't

02:02:54.800 --> 02:03:03.040
know i don't want to reduce my hand size but oh if i would wait hold on hear me out if i reduce

02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:09.680
my hand size by one we still are only rolling for aces and we can still discard five at a time

02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:17.200
and if the ante is less it means i don't need to get as much at the moment which is what i'm kind of

02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:29.520
needing oh that's not hand side that's hands numbers that i can play oh no i don't like that then

02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:36.480
no sorry i don't like that can i get an ace i get a cheeky ace ace ace don't be shy give me a

02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:40.320
fucking ace wow another jack

02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:49.440
if the card is held at the end of the round i will get a tarot wow

02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:54.640
ten chips three dollars with the card no i don't need it like that

02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:02.800
yeah i think i'm going with jack purple again the four is good as well four chips

02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:08.080
i don't go for one and four though my everything's on ace because of my ace card

02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:12.720
we're yeah here if i play aces i get insane like i'm uh i'm not gonna try and

02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:22.640
wait are you telling me to do math the purple jack is a tarot if discarded

02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:28.400
no if it's held in my hand creates a tarot as well yeah

02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:38.000
is it a poly what are you saying is it a polychrome glassed four are you memeing or is that real

02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:46.720
is that a real attribute to this game or am i being frigging it's read strawny read ten right jack

02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:50.960
of clubs ten plus three dollars if this card is held in your hand at the end of the round creates

02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:57.440
a tarot card when discarded however wait so they conflict i already have a purple seal on a jack

02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:05.600
they conflict if i hold on to it i get money if i discard it i get a tarot just take the purple

02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:10.960
where i'm listening to you so i'm getting i'm getting all confuggled i'm no smart enough for this

02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:16.960
right if this is shit and doesn't give me an ace i'm just gonna skip right

02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:27.040
oh you know what i'm sick he is oh it's so pretty though oh my god it's perilous and

02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:36.960

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:02.640
what am i looking at here can i do a double ten

02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:09.360

04:17:54.160 --> 04:17:57.160
Wait, eight, seven, six, five, four.

04:18:00.160 --> 04:18:01.160
Oh, it's cool.

04:18:04.160 --> 04:18:06.160
Ten, nine, eight, seven, eight.

04:18:09.160 --> 04:18:10.160
I see diamonds.

04:18:16.160 --> 04:18:18.160
Surely I'll get another diamond.

04:18:18.160 --> 04:18:19.160
No, I won't!

04:18:21.160 --> 04:18:22.160
Shit, I kind of want a diamond.

04:18:24.160 --> 04:18:25.160
Um...

04:18:34.160 --> 04:18:36.160
These are so big, but fuck it, I want a diamond.

04:18:36.160 --> 04:18:37.160
Give me one.

04:18:37.160 --> 04:18:39.160
Yes, one, two, three, four, five.

04:18:39.160 --> 04:18:40.160
Lovely.

04:18:40.160 --> 04:18:43.160
How much we getting?

04:18:43.160 --> 04:18:45.160
We're getting two free jokers out of this as well.

04:18:45.160 --> 04:18:47.160
Double ace, double king.

04:18:47.160 --> 04:18:48.160
Done.

04:18:48.160 --> 04:18:49.160
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

04:18:51.160 --> 04:18:53.160
I'm eating my chicken nipples.

04:18:55.160 --> 04:18:56.160
Well, there you go.

04:18:56.160 --> 04:19:00.160
We are a bit poor, but so is reals cost less.

04:19:02.160 --> 04:19:03.160
Wait!

04:19:04.160 --> 04:19:06.160
Oh, no!

04:19:10.160 --> 04:19:11.160
Oh, no.

04:19:11.160 --> 04:19:14.160
It overrids the other one we could have got.

04:19:16.160 --> 04:19:19.160
I want to reset the run.

04:19:20.160 --> 04:19:21.160
I'm going to reset.

04:19:21.160 --> 04:19:23.160
I didn't know I did that in your run.

04:19:23.160 --> 04:19:24.160
Yeah.

04:19:25.160 --> 04:19:27.160
I didn't realise it did that.

04:19:28.160 --> 04:19:29.160
Okay.

04:19:30.160 --> 04:19:32.160
One joker slot minus a hand.

04:19:32.160 --> 04:19:33.160
Oh, okay.

04:19:34.160 --> 04:19:36.160
We didn't even do anything though.

04:19:36.160 --> 04:19:38.160
We didn't even achieve anything.

04:19:38.160 --> 04:19:39.160
Right.

04:19:39.160 --> 04:19:41.160
If I skip this one,

04:19:43.160 --> 04:19:45.160
and then go into this one.

04:19:45.160 --> 04:19:46.160
Yes.

04:19:46.160 --> 04:19:47.160
Jeez.

04:19:47.160 --> 04:19:49.160
Sorry, I'm a bit slow.

04:19:49.160 --> 04:19:50.160
Right.

04:19:50.160 --> 04:19:53.160
We can actually do a wee baby straight right here.

04:19:53.160 --> 04:19:54.160
Why not?

04:20:01.160 --> 04:20:02.160
Oh, my God.

04:20:02.160 --> 04:20:03.160
This is delicious.

04:20:03.160 --> 04:20:05.160
Wait, I'll just go around.

04:20:06.160 --> 04:20:10.160
It's very hard to lose at this stage.

04:20:13.160 --> 04:20:15.160
I'll go with duple b.

04:20:15.160 --> 04:20:16.160
Okay.

04:20:18.160 --> 04:20:21.160
I think we're going to have to get rid of all this.

04:20:22.160 --> 04:20:23.160
There we go.

04:20:23.160 --> 04:20:25.160
That's what I'm looking for.

04:20:25.160 --> 04:20:27.160
I can't just get rid of that.

04:20:27.160 --> 04:20:28.160
Okay.

04:20:28.160 --> 04:20:30.160
I'm confident in the lower rounds because I'm like,

04:20:30.160 --> 04:20:32.160
it's hard to lose in the lower rounds

04:20:32.160 --> 04:20:35.160
unless you have like devious luck.

04:20:36.160 --> 04:20:37.160
Oh.

04:20:42.160 --> 04:20:43.160
No, sorry.

04:20:43.160 --> 04:20:44.160
The voucher is worth it.

04:20:44.160 --> 04:20:46.160
One extra hand size.

04:20:47.160 --> 04:20:48.160
Yeah.

04:20:48.160 --> 04:20:49.160
Worth.

04:20:49.160 --> 04:20:50.160
I'm keeping it.

04:20:50.160 --> 04:20:51.160
It's mine.

04:20:51.160 --> 04:20:52.160
Next round.

04:20:52.160 --> 04:20:53.160
Let's go.

04:20:54.160 --> 04:20:55.160
Oh.

04:20:56.160 --> 04:20:58.160
The blind was actually reducing it.

04:20:58.160 --> 04:21:00.160
So I've just made it neutral now.

04:21:00.160 --> 04:21:02.160
Oh, my free joker.

04:21:05.160 --> 04:21:07.160
Why am I like this?

04:21:08.160 --> 04:21:10.160
Why was I born this way?

04:21:11.160 --> 04:21:15.160
Why can I only retain one piece of information at a time?

04:21:16.160 --> 04:21:17.160
Why?

04:21:17.160 --> 04:21:20.160
The average human can retain like seven pieces of information

04:21:20.160 --> 04:21:21.160
at any moment.

04:21:21.160 --> 04:21:22.160
Me?

04:21:22.160 --> 04:21:23.160
One.

04:21:24.160 --> 04:21:26.160
That restart.

04:21:26.160 --> 04:21:27.160
Unironically.

04:21:27.160 --> 04:21:28.160
Right.

04:21:28.160 --> 04:21:29.160
Fuck it.

04:21:29.160 --> 04:21:30.160
We're restarting.

04:21:30.160 --> 04:21:31.160
I want to win.

04:21:31.160 --> 04:21:32.160
I want to win.

04:21:32.160 --> 04:21:33.160
Let me reset.

04:21:33.160 --> 04:21:34.160
Let's try it again.

04:21:34.160 --> 04:21:35.160
Three rolls the next shot.

04:21:35.160 --> 04:21:36.160
Yeah.

04:21:36.160 --> 04:21:37.160
No, that's fine.

04:21:37.160 --> 04:21:38.160
Let's go.

04:21:39.160 --> 04:21:41.160
We need to play perfectly

04:21:41.160 --> 04:21:43.160
or we might not as well play at all.

04:21:43.160 --> 04:21:45.160
I'm getting rid of all that and just doing trips.

04:21:50.160 --> 04:21:51.160
Oh, wow.

04:21:51.160 --> 04:21:52.160
Full house.

04:21:52.160 --> 04:21:53.160
Don't mind if I do.

04:21:53.160 --> 04:21:54.160
Don't mind if I do.

04:21:59.160 --> 04:22:00.160
Okay.

04:22:00.160 --> 04:22:01.160
Good.

04:22:01.160 --> 04:22:02.160
What are you doing?

04:22:05.160 --> 04:22:06.160
Mm-hmm.

04:22:06.160 --> 04:22:07.160
Mm-hmm.

04:22:07.160 --> 04:22:08.160
Mm-hmm.

04:22:10.160 --> 04:22:11.160
I'll take you.

04:22:13.160 --> 04:22:15.160
That looks good to me.

04:22:15.160 --> 04:22:16.160
That looks good to you.

04:22:16.160 --> 04:22:17.160
Cuttlefish memory.

04:22:17.160 --> 04:22:18.160
Goldfish memory.

04:22:18.160 --> 04:22:19.160
Oh, I'm way worse.

04:22:19.160 --> 04:22:20.160
Seriously.

04:22:21.160 --> 04:22:22.160
Mm.

04:22:24.160 --> 04:22:27.160
Something else must be your other sex.

04:22:27.160 --> 04:22:29.160
I just think of refluence for the rest.

04:22:29.160 --> 04:22:30.160
Right.

04:22:30.160 --> 04:22:31.160
I'm happy with that.

04:22:31.160 --> 04:22:32.160
I'm going to plan it up,

04:22:32.160 --> 04:22:34.160
which will help me in later game stuff.

04:22:35.160 --> 04:22:36.160
Redeem.

04:22:36.160 --> 04:22:37.160
Okay, good.

04:22:38.160 --> 04:22:40.160
Okay, I think I'm going to kick in again.

04:22:41.160 --> 04:22:42.160
This is delicious.

04:22:44.160 --> 04:22:45.160
Mm-hmm.

04:22:47.160 --> 04:22:48.160
Mm-hmm.

04:22:51.160 --> 04:22:52.160
Mm-hmm.

04:22:54.160 --> 04:22:57.160
That won't get access to the shop until after all of this.

04:22:58.160 --> 04:23:00.160
But it's a free joker.

04:23:01.160 --> 04:23:04.160
Surely I won't forget about the joker.

04:23:04.160 --> 04:23:07.160
Surely I won't forget about the joker.

04:23:07.160 --> 04:23:10.160
All hearts are debuffed.

04:23:10.160 --> 04:23:11.160
That's a lot of hearts.

04:23:11.160 --> 04:23:12.160
I'm not going to lie.

04:23:12.160 --> 04:23:13.160
If I had a king,

04:23:13.160 --> 04:23:15.160
we actually could have done a straight flush there.

04:23:16.160 --> 04:23:17.160
Mm-hmm.

04:23:17.160 --> 04:23:20.160
Get rid of all of you.

04:23:21.160 --> 04:23:23.160
I have three discards, which is fine.

04:23:25.160 --> 04:23:26.160
Um...

04:23:27.160 --> 04:23:28.160
Full house?

04:23:29.160 --> 04:23:30.160
Full house.

04:23:30.160 --> 04:23:31.160
Yes, full house.

04:23:34.160 --> 04:23:35.160
Right.

04:23:35.160 --> 04:23:36.160
Uh, doubles?

04:23:37.160 --> 04:23:38.160
I'll take it.

04:23:38.160 --> 04:23:39.160
I'll throw away this eight,

04:23:39.160 --> 04:23:40.160
because I can't do anything with it.

04:23:40.160 --> 04:23:41.160
Oh, I'm going to see...

04:23:44.160 --> 04:23:45.160
Sorry.

04:23:45.160 --> 04:23:46.160
Ugh.

04:23:47.160 --> 04:23:48.160
Um...

04:23:48.160 --> 04:23:49.160
We'll get rid of the two,

04:23:49.160 --> 04:23:51.160
because it doesn't do anything for me.

04:23:51.160 --> 04:23:52.160
But it's here.

04:23:52.160 --> 04:23:54.160
Thank you very much, we fling.

04:23:54.160 --> 04:23:55.160
Um...

04:23:55.160 --> 04:23:56.160
Well, we have 400.

04:23:56.160 --> 04:23:58.160
We've still got enough free runs.

04:23:58.160 --> 04:23:59.160
I am...

04:24:00.160 --> 04:24:03.160
Let's just clear this deck up a bit.

04:24:03.160 --> 04:24:04.160
I'm not really wanting that.

04:24:04.160 --> 04:24:05.160
Two joker.

04:24:06.160 --> 04:24:07.160
Let's do...

04:24:07.160 --> 04:24:08.160
Oh, two...

04:24:08.160 --> 04:24:09.160
Oh, well.

04:24:09.160 --> 04:24:11.160
That doesn't count, so it's not actually debuffed.

04:24:13.160 --> 04:24:14.160
Bless you.

04:24:14.160 --> 04:24:15.160
He's on high.

04:24:15.160 --> 04:24:16.160
Salute.

04:24:17.160 --> 04:24:18.160
Wait, you're still here?

04:24:18.160 --> 04:24:19.160
Look.

04:24:19.160 --> 04:24:20.160
I'm sorry.

04:24:21.160 --> 04:24:22.160
I'm sorry.

04:24:23.160 --> 04:24:25.160
We're redirecting into Ezra.

04:24:25.160 --> 04:24:27.160
I know it was supposed to be a small stream day.

04:24:27.160 --> 04:24:28.160
I'm addicted.

04:24:28.160 --> 04:24:29.160
Okay, I admit it.

04:24:29.160 --> 04:24:30.160
I have a problem.

04:24:30.160 --> 04:24:32.160
Stage one is admitting you have a problem.

04:24:32.160 --> 04:24:35.160
Does it mean you actually have to fix the problem instantly?

04:24:35.160 --> 04:24:37.160
No, it does not mean that.

04:24:37.160 --> 04:24:38.160
What are you?

04:24:38.160 --> 04:24:39.160
Please.

04:24:39.160 --> 04:24:40.160
Right.

04:24:40.160 --> 04:24:42.160
Retrigger each played.

04:24:42.160 --> 04:24:44.160
Yoink for free.

04:24:44.160 --> 04:24:45.160
What are you?

04:24:45.160 --> 04:24:46.160
Permanently gain a hand each round.

04:24:48.160 --> 04:24:49.160
Mmm.

04:24:51.160 --> 04:24:53.160
But my pair...

04:24:54.160 --> 04:24:56.160
Multiplier is also a hollow.

04:24:56.160 --> 04:24:57.160
Get in my belly.

04:24:57.160 --> 04:24:58.160
Right now.

04:24:58.160 --> 04:24:59.160
Let's go.

04:24:59.160 --> 04:25:00.160
I'll see if I can get this.

04:25:00.160 --> 04:25:02.160
That would be good to get the pick up.

04:25:02.160 --> 04:25:03.160
One extra thingy.

04:25:07.160 --> 04:25:08.160
It would be free.

04:25:09.160 --> 04:25:11.160
It would be free and we have no economy.

04:25:12.160 --> 04:25:15.160
It would be free, but we'd have no economy.

04:25:17.160 --> 04:25:18.160
It's holographic.

04:25:18.160 --> 04:25:21.160
Next based edition Joker is free and comes holographic.

04:25:21.160 --> 04:25:22.160
It's free and comes holographic.

04:25:22.160 --> 04:25:25.160
Are you addicted to Boutro or Strewn?

04:25:25.160 --> 04:25:27.160
What if I said both?

04:25:28.160 --> 04:25:29.160
Did you get the free Joker?

04:25:29.160 --> 04:25:30.160
I did.

04:25:30.160 --> 04:25:33.160
The free Joker is retriggered each played lower card.

04:25:33.160 --> 04:25:35.160
And it's called hack.

04:25:35.160 --> 04:25:36.160
What an interesting name.

04:25:36.160 --> 04:25:40.160
And then I have Sly Joker, which is a holographic.

04:25:40.160 --> 04:25:42.160
So he has 10 multi on pairs.

04:25:42.160 --> 04:25:44.160
So I think we're already doing the pairs.

04:25:46.160 --> 04:25:49.160
We went from gambling bad to gambling addiction in three days.

04:25:49.160 --> 04:25:50.160
It's so jover.

04:25:50.160 --> 04:25:51.160
It's so jover.

04:25:58.160 --> 04:26:03.160
The reward is $3 plus or a holographic for free.

04:26:06.160 --> 04:26:08.160
Our economy is so low.

04:26:10.160 --> 04:26:12.160
I'm needing to build the economy, I think.

04:26:13.160 --> 04:26:15.160
By the way, hollow is flat multi, not tied to a pair.

04:26:18.160 --> 04:26:19.160
All right then.

04:26:20.160 --> 04:26:21.160
All right, you've sold me.

04:26:21.160 --> 04:26:22.160
You've sold me.

04:26:22.160 --> 04:26:23.160
All right.

04:26:23.160 --> 04:26:25.160
Oh, how much?

04:26:25.160 --> 04:26:27.160
Wait, why is it so big?

04:26:35.160 --> 04:26:36.160
I need a 10.

04:26:37.160 --> 04:26:39.160
Let's get rid of all of you then.

04:26:40.160 --> 04:26:41.160
Wait, what do you do?

04:26:41.160 --> 04:26:43.160
If I play a pair, right.

04:26:43.160 --> 04:26:44.160
What happens if I play a pair?

04:26:44.160 --> 04:26:46.160
This is just a test to see what happens when I play a pair.

04:26:46.160 --> 04:26:48.160
I'll also play these to get rid of them.

04:26:48.160 --> 04:26:49.160
What happens if I do a pair?

04:26:49.160 --> 04:26:50.160
What do you do?

04:26:51.160 --> 04:26:52.160
Shit.

04:26:52.160 --> 04:26:53.160
Oh, wait.

04:26:53.160 --> 04:26:54.160
No, you do fantastic.

04:26:54.160 --> 04:26:55.160
Do that again.

04:26:55.160 --> 04:26:56.160
Do it again.

04:26:56.160 --> 04:26:57.160
Right now.

04:26:57.160 --> 04:26:58.160
Right in front of me.

04:26:58.160 --> 04:26:59.160
Oh, that's what I'd like to see.

04:26:59.160 --> 04:27:00.160
Okay.

04:27:00.160 --> 04:27:01.160
Okay.

04:27:01.160 --> 04:27:02.160
Okay.

04:27:02.160 --> 04:27:03.160
That's what I'd like to see.

04:27:03.160 --> 04:27:04.160
I had to make sure.

04:27:04.160 --> 04:27:05.160
I wasn't sure.

04:27:05.160 --> 04:27:06.160
Okay.

04:27:06.160 --> 04:27:07.160
I wasn't sure.

04:27:07.160 --> 04:27:08.160
Right.

04:27:08.160 --> 04:27:09.160
We made $7.

04:27:09.160 --> 04:27:17.160
We need one more dollar, one more doll here, and then we can grab this, which is exactly

04:27:17.160 --> 04:27:18.160
what I want.

04:27:19.160 --> 04:27:20.160
Oh, wait.

04:27:20.160 --> 04:27:21.160
Free Joker.

04:27:21.160 --> 04:27:22.160
Sorry.

04:27:22.160 --> 04:27:23.160
Sorry, free Joker.

04:27:23.160 --> 04:27:24.160
15 multi, one in six chance.

04:27:24.160 --> 04:27:25.160
It gets destroyed though.

04:27:25.160 --> 04:27:26.160
I mean, it was free.

04:27:26.160 --> 04:27:27.160
So I'm not going to be mad.

04:27:27.160 --> 04:27:28.160
Sorry.

04:27:28.160 --> 04:27:29.160
I am so sorry.

04:27:29.160 --> 04:27:32.160
I literally raise all your blood pressures when I do that.

04:27:32.160 --> 04:27:33.160
I just forget.

04:27:33.160 --> 04:27:34.160
I'm like, oh yeah.

04:27:34.160 --> 04:27:35.160
Yeah.

04:27:35.160 --> 04:27:36.160
Right.

04:27:36.160 --> 04:27:37.160
Oh no.

04:27:37.160 --> 04:27:39.160
We're not going to have access to this because I skipped a freaking round.

04:27:39.160 --> 04:27:40.160
Did I?

04:27:40.160 --> 04:27:41.160
I think so.

04:27:41.160 --> 04:27:43.160
Can I sell you?

04:27:44.160 --> 04:27:49.160
So there's a chance it gets destroyed.

04:27:49.160 --> 04:27:53.160
And I'm like, if there's a chance for it to get destroyed, that's quite high.

04:27:53.160 --> 04:27:59.160
I'm tempted to just sell it and then buy this for an extra round at a chance.

04:27:59.160 --> 04:28:05.160
Because if it's going to destroy itself, wait, you guys are celebrating the card though.

04:28:05.160 --> 04:28:06.160
Oh no.

04:28:06.160 --> 04:28:12.160
Once it breaks, you can get another Joker called keep the banana at specials free.

04:28:12.160 --> 04:28:13.160
Okay.

04:28:13.160 --> 04:28:16.160
I'll keep the banana because I'm not unlocked what the banana does.

04:28:16.160 --> 04:28:17.160
Okay.

04:28:17.160 --> 04:28:20.160
Oh, someone says sell though.

04:28:20.160 --> 04:28:27.160
Someone says sell hack.

04:28:27.160 --> 04:28:28.160
You know what?

04:28:28.160 --> 04:28:29.160
Sell hack.

04:28:29.160 --> 04:28:30.160
And then give me this.

04:28:30.160 --> 04:28:33.160
I want an extra round to increase my odds of success.

04:28:33.160 --> 04:28:35.160
One in seven cards gets thrown face down.

04:28:35.160 --> 04:28:36.160
That's fine.

04:28:36.160 --> 04:28:37.160
I'll survive.

04:28:37.160 --> 04:28:38.160
I'll survive.

04:28:38.160 --> 04:28:39.160
I won't survive.

04:28:39.160 --> 04:28:41.160
What the heck are you?

04:28:41.160 --> 04:28:42.160
I don't know.

04:28:42.160 --> 04:28:43.160
Right.

04:28:43.160 --> 04:28:48.160
We'll get rid of the two.

04:28:48.160 --> 04:28:50.160
And the seven and the ten I get.

04:28:50.160 --> 04:28:52.160
Seven's getting a bit high.

04:28:52.160 --> 04:28:53.160
You know what?

04:28:53.160 --> 04:28:55.160
I'll just get rid of these playhounds now.

04:28:55.160 --> 04:28:57.160
I was four.

04:28:57.160 --> 04:28:58.160
Curious.

04:28:58.160 --> 04:28:59.160
Whoa.

04:28:59.160 --> 04:29:02.160
The molly went off.

04:29:02.160 --> 04:29:04.160
The molly went off.

04:29:04.160 --> 04:29:07.160
Don't mind if I do.

04:29:07.160 --> 04:29:08.160
Right.

04:29:08.160 --> 04:29:09.160
What are you?

04:29:10.160 --> 04:29:11.160
Right.

04:29:11.160 --> 04:29:13.160
Just to ask.

04:29:13.160 --> 04:29:14.160
Okay.

04:29:14.160 --> 04:29:15.160
Just to ask.

04:29:15.160 --> 04:29:17.160
What do you do?

04:29:17.160 --> 04:29:19.160
Minus the ante though.

04:29:19.160 --> 04:29:22.160
What?

04:29:22.160 --> 04:29:26.160
I'm tempted in the ante rewind because we unlocked the hand.

04:29:26.160 --> 04:29:30.160
So we would be back to what the usual is but one less in difficulty.

04:29:30.160 --> 04:29:31.160
I am tempted.

04:29:31.160 --> 04:29:32.160
I'll be honest.

04:29:32.160 --> 04:29:34.160
Sly Joker.

04:29:34.160 --> 04:29:38.160
Does Sly Joker compliment three of a kind Joker?

04:29:38.160 --> 04:29:39.160
Wait.

04:29:39.160 --> 04:29:40.160
Three of a kind.

04:29:40.160 --> 04:29:41.160
Yeah.

04:29:41.160 --> 04:29:42.160
Three of a kind.

04:29:42.160 --> 04:29:43.160
Sombra Apoc.

04:29:43.160 --> 04:29:45.160
Thank you for coming to member.

04:29:45.160 --> 04:29:46.160
I appreciate it.

04:29:46.160 --> 04:29:49.160
I'm sorry to all members who are waiting on the membership ASMR.

04:29:49.160 --> 04:29:51.160
I'm a little addicted right now.

04:29:51.160 --> 04:29:52.160
Need to get economy going.

04:29:52.160 --> 04:29:54.160
Oh, you're right.

04:29:54.160 --> 04:30:05.160
But if this is going to reduce the aggro of trying to win, I think we're going to get

04:30:05.160 --> 04:30:10.160
some easy rounds in.

04:30:10.160 --> 04:30:15.160
If it reduces the aggro, I think it's the best.

04:30:15.160 --> 04:30:19.160
It'll give me $9 if I don't play this game.

04:30:19.160 --> 04:30:28.160
So I take it because I can't make $9 in a round right now.

04:30:28.160 --> 04:30:29.160
Worth it.

04:30:29.160 --> 04:30:30.160
Okay.

04:30:30.160 --> 04:30:36.160
Initial cards and booster packs in the next shop are free.

04:30:36.160 --> 04:30:43.160
Initial cards and booster packs are free.

04:30:43.160 --> 04:30:46.160
The booster packs are free.

04:30:46.160 --> 04:30:47.160
Yeah.

04:30:47.160 --> 04:30:49.160
This one too.

04:30:49.160 --> 04:30:50.160
Double skip.

04:30:50.160 --> 04:30:52.160
I need to leave now.

04:30:52.160 --> 04:30:53.160
Rest well.

04:30:53.160 --> 04:30:54.160
Thank you for hanging.

04:30:54.160 --> 04:30:55.160
I appreciate it.

04:30:55.160 --> 04:30:56.160
Sorry for being addicted.

04:30:56.160 --> 04:30:57.160
Worth as well.

04:30:57.160 --> 04:30:58.160
Okay.

04:30:58.160 --> 04:31:01.160
Discard two random cards pair hand plate.

04:31:01.160 --> 04:31:02.160
Oh, no.

04:31:02.160 --> 04:31:03.160
You mean I get to...

04:31:03.160 --> 04:31:04.160
Oh, wait.

04:31:04.160 --> 04:31:08.160
Discard two random cards.

04:31:08.160 --> 04:31:16.160
Well, the best I can do is this.

04:31:16.160 --> 04:31:18.160
Oh, wait.

04:31:18.160 --> 04:31:19.160
In my hand.

04:31:19.160 --> 04:31:21.160
Oh, well, we won.

04:31:21.160 --> 04:31:24.160
Oh, well.

04:31:24.160 --> 04:31:27.160
Thank you, I guess.

04:31:27.160 --> 04:31:29.160
Everything is free.

04:31:29.160 --> 04:31:33.160
Earn two bucks pair discard if no discards are used.

04:31:33.160 --> 04:31:35.160
Thank you.

04:31:35.160 --> 04:31:36.160
Destroy two cards.

04:31:36.160 --> 04:31:39.160
I don't know if I want to destroy cards yet.

04:31:39.160 --> 04:31:41.160
Use two tarot cards.

04:31:41.160 --> 04:31:43.160
Choose between a joker.

04:31:43.160 --> 04:31:45.160
Let's go.

04:31:45.160 --> 04:31:48.160
Each played 10 or four gives 10 chips in a multi.

04:31:48.160 --> 04:31:50.160
Every played card permanently...

04:31:50.160 --> 04:31:51.160
Oh, we've just started.

04:31:51.160 --> 04:31:53.160
So backpack man, you're in.

04:31:53.160 --> 04:31:54.160
We've just started.

04:31:54.160 --> 04:31:57.160
Use two tarot cards immediately.

04:31:57.160 --> 04:31:59.160
We have just started.

04:31:59.160 --> 04:32:00.160
Hydration check.

04:32:00.160 --> 04:32:01.160
Yes, little reeflings.

04:32:01.160 --> 04:32:04.160
Please do hydrate.

04:32:04.160 --> 04:32:06.160
I like the lucky cards.

04:32:06.160 --> 04:32:07.160
Creates a random joker.

04:32:07.160 --> 04:32:08.160
Converts.

04:32:08.160 --> 04:32:09.160
Nope.

04:32:09.160 --> 04:32:10.160
Nope.

04:32:10.160 --> 04:32:11.160
Nope.

04:32:11.160 --> 04:32:12.160
Okay, it's you.

04:32:12.160 --> 04:32:14.160
I think it's you.

04:32:14.160 --> 04:32:16.160
And put it on the kings.

04:32:16.160 --> 04:32:18.160
I think put it on the kings.

04:32:18.160 --> 04:32:23.160
Yeah, two kings locked up on the magician.

04:32:23.160 --> 04:32:25.160
I've got one yes.

04:32:25.160 --> 04:32:27.160
I've got one yes.

04:32:27.160 --> 04:32:29.160
I'm getting my hand held.

04:32:29.160 --> 04:32:30.160
Yeah.

04:32:30.160 --> 04:32:31.160
Sure, why not?

04:32:31.160 --> 04:32:32.160
Okay.

04:32:32.160 --> 04:32:33.160
Good logic then.

04:32:33.160 --> 04:32:34.160
Oh, look at that.

04:32:34.160 --> 04:32:35.160
Old tassie.

04:32:35.160 --> 04:32:36.160
Joker.

04:32:36.160 --> 04:32:38.160
Convert up to three.

04:32:38.160 --> 04:32:39.160
Nope.

04:32:39.160 --> 04:32:40.160
Hot.

04:32:40.160 --> 04:32:41.160
What does this do?

04:32:41.160 --> 04:32:43.160
Converts a random joker card.

04:32:43.160 --> 04:32:44.160
Creates.

04:32:44.160 --> 04:32:46.160
Sorry, not converts.

04:32:46.160 --> 04:32:47.160
Creates.

04:32:47.160 --> 04:32:48.160
I am not going to go like this one.

04:32:48.160 --> 04:32:51.160
This joker gains a multiplier pair consecutive hand played

04:32:51.160 --> 04:32:54.160
without playing your most played poker hand.

04:32:54.160 --> 04:32:56.160
The obelisk.

04:32:56.160 --> 04:32:57.160
Sure.

04:32:57.160 --> 04:33:01.160
If we want to destroy...

04:33:01.160 --> 04:33:07.160
I mean, it's free, so...

04:33:07.160 --> 04:33:09.160
Maybe we'll hold on to it for now

04:33:09.160 --> 04:33:11.160
because I don't know if we're going to try and go

04:33:11.160 --> 04:33:13.160
for certain numbers or whatever.

04:33:13.160 --> 04:33:15.160
That's a hard...

04:33:15.160 --> 04:33:16.160
I hope for a good joker.

04:33:16.160 --> 04:33:17.160
It's kind of hard.

04:33:17.160 --> 04:33:19.160
I mean, it's just going to happen naturally.

04:33:19.160 --> 04:33:23.160
Raise the cap on interest earned.

04:33:23.160 --> 04:33:24.160
Yes.

04:33:24.160 --> 04:33:27.160
This is good for our economy now.

04:33:27.160 --> 04:33:30.160
We're only going to be able to get one extra dollar back,

04:33:30.160 --> 04:33:32.160
but over time, it's going to add up.

04:33:32.160 --> 04:33:34.160
So let's not beat around the bush.

04:33:34.160 --> 04:33:35.160
Gives...

04:33:35.160 --> 04:33:36.160
Nope.

04:33:36.160 --> 04:33:37.160
I don't know what that means.

04:33:37.160 --> 04:33:38.160
So we're not playing it.

04:33:38.160 --> 04:33:39.160
I don't know what it means.

04:33:39.160 --> 04:33:40.160
Ooh!

04:33:40.160 --> 04:33:44.160
We've already got double a vase

04:33:44.160 --> 04:33:47.160
and I'll throw the four away.

04:33:47.160 --> 04:33:54.160
Play hands.

04:33:54.160 --> 04:33:57.160
I don't mind if I do.

04:33:57.160 --> 04:33:59.160
Delayed gratification.

04:33:59.160 --> 04:34:01.160
Six dollars?

04:34:01.160 --> 04:34:03.160
Wait, what's delayed gratification?

04:34:03.160 --> 04:34:06.160
You earn two bucks per discard

04:34:06.160 --> 04:34:08.160
if no discards are used.

04:34:08.160 --> 04:34:13.160
That's not delayed gratification.

04:34:13.160 --> 04:34:15.160
That's faster than I normally finish.

04:34:15.160 --> 04:34:18.160
What are you on about?

04:34:18.160 --> 04:34:21.160
Choose one out of four spectra.

04:34:21.160 --> 04:34:23.160
A bit of a bank card again.

04:34:23.160 --> 04:34:25.160
Is that when I can enhance a card?

04:34:25.160 --> 04:34:26.160
Oh, wow.

04:34:26.160 --> 04:34:27.160
Delayed gratification.

04:34:27.160 --> 04:34:31.160
We'll get you 50 on Mac interest so fast, yeah.

04:34:31.160 --> 04:34:35.160
Playing card to add to your deck.

04:34:35.160 --> 04:34:38.160
We're kind of a straight flush.

04:34:38.160 --> 04:34:41.160
No, I don't even want to waste my money on a straight flush.

04:34:41.160 --> 04:34:43.160
Choose...

04:34:44.160 --> 04:34:46.160
I think I want a max economy.

04:34:46.160 --> 04:34:48.160
Let's do a max economy right away.

04:34:48.160 --> 04:34:50.160
One more round and we'll be good to go.

04:34:50.160 --> 04:34:55.160
I'm needing some joker cards to shape the way I play the game though.

04:34:55.160 --> 04:34:57.160
I think once this gets destroyed we can pick up.

04:34:57.160 --> 04:35:01.160
I have a pair joker card.

04:35:01.160 --> 04:35:04.160
No, let's do a economy please.

04:35:04.160 --> 04:35:08.160
I do 50 chips if played hand contains a pair.

04:35:08.160 --> 04:35:10.160
Two pairs, let's go.

04:35:10.160 --> 04:35:14.160
Get rid of the nine I guess because I've already got a little cheeky pair right here.

04:35:14.160 --> 04:35:18.160
Joker gains for a hand that's not played.

04:35:18.160 --> 04:35:22.160
Hanged man on the twos maybe.

04:35:22.160 --> 04:35:26.160
Just to get them out of the way.

04:35:26.160 --> 04:35:29.160
See, if Fibonacci comes into play...

04:35:29.160 --> 04:35:31.160
Full 18!

04:35:31.160 --> 04:35:34.160
Delayed gratification is nuts.

04:35:34.160 --> 04:35:36.160
Holy crap.

04:35:36.160 --> 04:35:38.160
We do have...

04:35:38.160 --> 04:35:40.160
This is just straight up for multiplayer.

04:35:40.160 --> 04:35:42.160
My banana's gone!

04:35:42.160 --> 04:35:44.160
Who took my banana?

04:35:44.160 --> 04:35:46.160
Give it back right now.

04:35:46.160 --> 04:35:48.160
Give me my banana back.

04:35:48.160 --> 04:35:50.160
Great, we're going to get that because that's fantastic.

04:35:50.160 --> 04:35:52.160
Right multiplayer, do I need to put it in a certain order?

04:35:52.160 --> 04:35:54.160
Maybe after the obelisk?

04:35:54.160 --> 04:35:58.160
You don't want to play your best hand every round to scale obelisk.

04:35:58.160 --> 04:36:00.160
Ooh.

04:36:00.160 --> 04:36:04.160
Okay, maybe we're probably going to swap out obelisk at some point.

04:36:04.160 --> 04:36:06.160
Can I get pairs?

04:36:06.160 --> 04:36:08.160
Pair love, contains a pair.

04:36:08.160 --> 04:36:10.160
Yes, let's level up Mercury.

04:36:10.160 --> 04:36:12.160
Nice and simple, we've already got Mercury getting on the thing.

04:36:12.160 --> 04:36:14.160
Choose one of three playing cards to add to the deck.

04:36:14.160 --> 04:36:18.160
See, I don't have anything that's shaped in a deck right now.

04:36:18.160 --> 04:36:22.160
Creates up to two random tarot cards.

04:36:22.160 --> 04:36:24.160
I mean, we could get the Wheel of Fortune, you know what?

04:36:24.160 --> 04:36:26.160
We could get the Wheel.

04:36:26.160 --> 04:36:28.160
Oh.

04:36:28.160 --> 04:36:32.160
I will sell you, I don't want to use you.

04:36:32.160 --> 04:36:34.160
You destroy up to two selected.

04:36:34.160 --> 04:36:38.160
I need some.

04:36:38.160 --> 04:36:42.160
Maybe just...

04:36:42.160 --> 04:36:44.160
I don't know.

04:36:44.160 --> 04:36:48.160
Well, whatever this does, we can buy it because we have 25.

04:36:48.160 --> 04:36:50.160
Ooh, I want luck.

04:36:50.160 --> 04:36:52.160
Yeah, I want luck, give me lucky.

04:36:52.160 --> 04:36:54.160
Lucky, lucky four.

04:36:54.160 --> 04:36:56.160
Wait, why did you sell what you just bought?

04:36:56.160 --> 04:36:58.160
I'm not going to use it.

04:36:58.160 --> 04:37:00.160
I don't like it.

04:37:00.160 --> 04:37:02.160
I don't like glass cards.

04:37:02.160 --> 04:37:06.160
Um, your interest cap is no 50.

04:37:06.160 --> 04:37:08.160
Scam Emperor's Edge, fair enough.

04:37:08.160 --> 04:37:10.160
Yeah, I don't like the idea of breaking a card.

04:37:10.160 --> 04:37:14.160
Cards played previously, this auntie, or debuff.

04:37:14.160 --> 04:37:18.160
That's fain.

04:37:18.160 --> 04:37:24.160
That's fain, that doesn't hurt me at all.

04:37:24.160 --> 04:37:28.160
Right, I'm just going to play all this to get rid of it.

04:37:28.160 --> 04:37:30.160
I think.

04:37:32.160 --> 04:37:38.160
Okay, what did that do?

04:37:38.160 --> 04:37:42.160
If I get an ace, I have a straight flush.

04:37:42.160 --> 04:37:44.160
So just play all of that.

04:37:44.160 --> 04:37:46.160
I have so many cards I can play.

04:37:46.160 --> 04:37:48.160
I don't like depending on glass though.

04:37:48.160 --> 04:37:50.160
Just translate to half a hind man.

04:37:50.160 --> 04:37:52.160
I make bad cards, glass.

04:37:52.160 --> 04:37:54.160
Yeah, I think I can...

04:37:54.160 --> 04:37:56.160
Oh, I do have a straight, you're right.

04:37:56.160 --> 04:37:58.160
Oh my god, one, two, three, four.

04:37:58.160 --> 04:38:00.160
Just like that.

04:38:00.160 --> 04:38:02.160
I forget this straight doesn't have to be an ace.

04:38:02.160 --> 04:38:04.160
Like a dumb dumb.

04:38:04.160 --> 04:38:06.160
Oh no.

04:38:06.160 --> 04:38:08.160
That banana was working overtime.

04:38:08.160 --> 04:38:10.160
Not going to lie.

04:38:12.160 --> 04:38:16.160
9, 8, 7, 6, 5.

04:38:16.160 --> 04:38:18.160
Or 10 maybe.

04:38:18.160 --> 04:38:20.160
10, 9, 8, 7, 6.

04:38:20.160 --> 04:38:22.160
Is that just going to do it again?

04:38:22.160 --> 04:38:24.160
Is that enough?

04:38:24.160 --> 04:38:26.160
Oh, this isn't looking so good.

04:38:26.160 --> 04:38:28.160
I think I'll be doing ace more quickly than I thought.

04:38:28.160 --> 04:38:30.160
Delayed gratification still gave me...

04:38:30.160 --> 04:38:32.160
What, six dollars?

04:38:32.160 --> 04:38:34.160
But I didn't do it right.

04:38:34.160 --> 04:38:38.160
Earn two dollars per discard if no discards are used by the end of the round.

04:38:38.160 --> 04:38:42.160
Oh, whatever's remaining at times it by two.

04:38:42.160 --> 04:38:44.160
Okay, so three times two is six.

04:38:44.160 --> 04:38:46.160
Okay, okay.

04:38:46.160 --> 04:38:48.160
Big economy, let's go.

04:38:50.160 --> 04:38:52.160
Joker, turret, planet and spectral cards may appear multiple times.

04:38:52.160 --> 04:38:54.160
What's that mean?

04:38:54.160 --> 04:38:56.160
Foil, holographics are more likely.

04:38:56.160 --> 04:38:58.160
But that's just for a chance.

04:38:58.160 --> 04:39:00.160
Oh, we've got two celestials though.

04:39:00.160 --> 04:39:04.160
Hold on, let's do mega, cheeky mega celestials.

04:39:04.160 --> 04:39:08.160
We've got Mercury, straight on Mercury.

04:39:08.160 --> 04:39:10.160
Pairs, let's go. Shout out to all my pairs.

04:39:12.160 --> 04:39:14.160
Three of a kind contains a pair.

04:39:14.160 --> 04:39:20.160
So I am tempted to do three of a kind because it's more likely to occur.

04:39:20.160 --> 04:39:22.160
And then we'll do jumbo.

04:39:22.160 --> 04:39:26.160
Udinus, two pairs.

04:39:26.160 --> 04:39:28.160
Yeah, two pairs.

04:39:28.160 --> 04:39:30.160
Let's try that.

04:39:30.160 --> 04:39:32.160
Let's even out the kind of pairing match up setup.

04:39:34.160 --> 04:39:36.160
Should I do that?

04:39:38.160 --> 04:39:40.160
I don't know, I would put my economy below but...

04:39:42.160 --> 04:39:44.160
But...

04:39:44.160 --> 04:39:48.160
The economy is going very well with delayed gratification.

04:39:48.160 --> 04:39:50.160
Going the all render.

04:39:50.160 --> 04:39:54.160
Showman is tricky but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have lots of money.

04:39:56.160 --> 04:39:58.160
Remember that max economy is 50.

04:39:58.160 --> 04:40:00.160
Oh, it stays 50?

04:40:02.160 --> 04:40:04.160
So I'm burning through my max economy.

04:40:12.160 --> 04:40:16.160
Delayed gratifications giving us like 50 bucks around.

04:40:20.160 --> 04:40:36.160
I know I shouldn't be greedy but can create two common jokers.

04:40:36.160 --> 04:40:38.160
I don't even have room.

04:40:38.160 --> 04:40:40.160
I don't even have room.

04:40:40.160 --> 04:40:42.160
You can be a little greedy.

04:40:44.160 --> 04:40:48.160
We've got a triple and nothing else actually.

04:40:50.160 --> 04:40:52.160
Just use these up.

04:40:52.160 --> 04:40:54.160
Let's see if we can get our double four.

04:40:56.160 --> 04:40:58.160
Don't forget to hydrate.

04:41:02.160 --> 04:41:04.160
98765.

04:41:06.160 --> 04:41:08.160
Just like that.

04:41:08.160 --> 04:41:10.160
All done.

04:41:12.160 --> 04:41:14.160
Good luck on the straight.

04:41:16.160 --> 04:41:18.160
Cash out to 15.

04:41:18.160 --> 04:41:20.160
Getting this game was a mistake.

04:41:20.160 --> 04:41:22.160
I'm fucking addicted.

04:41:22.160 --> 04:41:24.160
Celestial pack jumbo.

04:41:28.160 --> 04:41:30.160
Oh, I love streamer luck.

04:41:30.160 --> 04:41:34.160
It's real and unfathomable with a base.

04:41:36.160 --> 04:41:38.160
What joker was that?

04:41:38.160 --> 04:41:40.160
Sorry, I keep burning through.

04:41:40.160 --> 04:41:42.160
One discard each round.

04:41:42.160 --> 04:41:44.160
Wait, are you...

04:41:44.160 --> 04:41:46.160
You thing you play into this one?

04:41:46.160 --> 04:41:48.160
I'm wondering if I should get rid of the obelisk.

04:41:50.160 --> 04:41:58.160
I technically am going to make $2 extra every time this guy is hanging out with the obelisk.

04:41:58.160 --> 04:42:00.160
You still have a slot?

04:42:00.160 --> 04:42:02.160
What did you call me?

04:42:02.160 --> 04:42:04.160
What did you call me, Riffin?

04:42:04.160 --> 04:42:06.160
Tarot card. Choose one tarot card.

04:42:06.160 --> 04:42:08.160
No, let's...

04:42:08.160 --> 04:42:10.160
Hold on to some economy.

04:42:10.160 --> 04:42:12.160
It gives us a spectral function.

04:42:12.160 --> 04:42:14.160
I...

04:42:14.160 --> 04:42:16.160
Exactly, that's what I thought.

04:42:16.160 --> 04:42:18.160
$2 double Vs.

04:42:26.160 --> 04:42:28.160
Five chips every time.

04:42:28.160 --> 04:42:30.160
It's plead. And the same round.

04:42:32.160 --> 04:42:34.160
Forever.

04:42:34.160 --> 04:42:36.160
Oh yeah, yeah, upgrade.

04:42:36.160 --> 04:42:38.160
Oh wow, okay, holy crap.

04:42:38.160 --> 04:42:40.160
I'm starting to...

04:42:40.160 --> 04:42:42.160
Get it. Mildly.

04:42:42.160 --> 04:42:44.160
I'm starting to get it.

04:42:44.160 --> 04:42:46.160
I want to upgrade all my...

04:42:46.160 --> 04:42:48.160
Everything then, I guess.

04:42:48.160 --> 04:42:50.160
Oh wait, the four didn't count.

04:42:50.160 --> 04:42:52.160
Sorry, I'm not paying attention.

04:42:52.160 --> 04:42:54.160
I'm just having fun putting it together.

04:42:54.160 --> 04:42:56.160
I think they've got me. I'm sorry.

04:42:56.160 --> 04:42:58.160
I think I've been hook, lain, and sinkered.

04:42:58.160 --> 04:43:00.160
Hook, lain, and sink...

04:43:00.160 --> 04:43:02.160
What? Hook, lain, and sinker!

04:43:02.160 --> 04:43:04.160
There.

04:43:04.160 --> 04:43:06.160
Okay, there we go.

04:43:06.160 --> 04:43:08.160
I'm not like paying attention because we don't have to sweat just yet.

04:43:08.160 --> 04:43:10.160
But when we have to start sweating,

04:43:10.160 --> 04:43:12.160
don't think I won't be looking at you as reference

04:43:12.160 --> 04:43:14.160
for advice, because I don't know what I'm doing.

04:43:14.160 --> 04:43:16.160
Delayed gratification gave us...

04:43:16.160 --> 04:43:18.160
Fuah. See? We've already made it back.

04:43:22.160 --> 04:43:24.160
Played cards with clubs gives a molly.

04:43:24.160 --> 04:43:26.160
One molly per tarot card used.

04:43:26.160 --> 04:43:28.160
This run?

04:43:28.160 --> 04:43:30.160
Wait!

04:43:32.160 --> 04:43:34.160
I'ma start flying left and right with tarot cards.

04:43:34.160 --> 04:43:36.160
If that... If I comprehend this correctly...

04:43:40.160 --> 04:43:42.160
If I comprehend this correctly,

04:43:42.160 --> 04:43:44.160
throw that out

04:43:44.160 --> 04:43:46.160
and then put that in

04:43:46.160 --> 04:43:48.160
and then go nuts buying stuff.

04:43:48.160 --> 04:43:50.160
Sell your red joker?

04:43:50.160 --> 04:43:52.160
This guy?

04:43:52.160 --> 04:43:54.160
I think sell the obelisk

04:43:54.160 --> 04:43:56.160
because I'm only going to want to do pairs.

04:43:58.160 --> 04:44:00.160
Yeah, I want to sell the obelisk.

04:44:00.160 --> 04:44:02.160
It works. I'm using it right now.

04:44:02.160 --> 04:44:04.160
Are you playing? Are you playing?

04:44:04.160 --> 04:44:06.160
At the same time as me?

04:44:06.160 --> 04:44:08.160
You're supposed to give me advice!

04:44:08.160 --> 04:44:10.160
You're supposed to tell me how to win.

04:44:10.160 --> 04:44:12.160
You've got to play it on your own.

04:44:12.160 --> 04:44:14.160
Right, sell the obelisk because the obelisk

04:44:14.160 --> 04:44:16.160
is going to start getting a bit useless.

04:44:18.160 --> 04:44:20.160
Tarot card buy.

04:44:20.160 --> 04:44:22.160
So you'll multiply.

04:44:22.160 --> 04:44:24.160
I'm going to start dropping tarot cards

04:44:24.160 --> 04:44:26.160
left and right. That's all I'm saying.

04:44:26.160 --> 04:44:28.160
Celestial pack? Let's go.

04:44:28.160 --> 04:44:30.160
Oh!

04:44:30.160 --> 04:44:32.160
Mercury.

04:44:32.160 --> 04:44:34.160
Oh, we love to see it mercury.

04:44:34.160 --> 04:44:36.160
We do. And then use two

04:44:36.160 --> 04:44:38.160
two Tarots. Right, let's go.

04:44:38.160 --> 04:44:40.160
The Wheel of Fortune.

04:44:40.160 --> 04:44:42.160
Oh, wait. Hold on. Hold on.

04:44:42.160 --> 04:44:44.160
Don't get... Hold on. Hold on. Pause. Pause. Pause.

04:44:44.160 --> 04:44:46.160
Don't get too ahead of yourself.

04:44:46.160 --> 04:44:48.160
I still need to read because I don't know what to do.

04:44:48.160 --> 04:44:50.160
Left card comes to right.

04:44:50.160 --> 04:44:52.160
Create two planetary cards.

04:44:52.160 --> 04:44:54.160
Curious. Create the last Tarot card.

04:44:54.160 --> 04:44:56.160
Oop!

04:44:58.160 --> 04:45:00.160
Create the last Tarot card or Planet card

04:45:00.160 --> 04:45:02.160
used during this run.

04:45:02.160 --> 04:45:04.160
The full is excluded. Mercury.

04:45:04.160 --> 04:45:06.160
I can level up pairs again with a full.

04:45:10.160 --> 04:45:12.160
Use the full.

04:45:12.160 --> 04:45:14.160
We're using the full.

04:45:14.160 --> 04:45:16.160
We're going to use that now.

04:45:16.160 --> 04:45:18.160
We're also going to delete some cards.

04:45:18.160 --> 04:45:20.160
No, we're not. We have to use it in-game apparently.

04:45:20.160 --> 04:45:22.160
Rude. And then it's my little guy.

04:45:22.160 --> 04:45:24.160
Oh my god, he's up at four!

04:45:24.160 --> 04:45:26.160
Right. And then imagine

04:45:26.160 --> 04:45:28.160
he gets hit with the Wheel of Fortune though.

04:45:32.160 --> 04:45:34.160
It's hard to use the Wheel.

04:45:34.160 --> 04:45:36.160
You can use the Hanged Mana.

04:45:36.160 --> 04:45:38.160
I just need to select.

04:45:38.160 --> 04:45:40.160
Oh, my apologies. Okay.

04:45:40.160 --> 04:45:42.160
Let's just get rid of the lower ones then.

04:45:44.160 --> 04:45:46.160
Okay. Do we get rid of the lower ones?

04:45:46.160 --> 04:45:48.160
Right. Hydration. Sorry.

04:45:48.160 --> 04:45:50.160
My tea's getting cold again.

04:45:52.160 --> 04:45:54.160
I cannae stream and drink tea at the same time.

04:45:54.160 --> 04:45:56.160
All the cheese, honestly.

04:45:58.160 --> 04:46:00.160
My Apocrates.

04:46:00.160 --> 04:46:02.160
Yeah, I don't have anything that is telling me

04:46:02.160 --> 04:46:04.160
unless the Fibonacci comes up

04:46:04.160 --> 04:46:06.160
instantly after this.

04:46:06.160 --> 04:46:08.160
Then four and six.

04:46:08.160 --> 04:46:10.160
I mean, we could bet the Fibonacci shows up.

04:46:10.160 --> 04:46:12.160
If we do four and six then...

04:46:12.160 --> 04:46:14.160
Yeah.

04:46:18.160 --> 04:46:20.160
Fuck it. We're going to see.

04:46:20.160 --> 04:46:22.160
He's up at five now.

04:46:22.160 --> 04:46:24.160
Multi-Cards.

04:46:24.160 --> 04:46:26.160
Planet.

04:46:26.160 --> 04:46:28.160
Possibly.

04:46:28.160 --> 04:46:30.160
Planet Earth.

04:46:30.160 --> 04:46:32.160
Risk it.

04:46:32.160 --> 04:46:34.160
I ain't risk it.

04:46:34.160 --> 04:46:36.160
No!

04:46:36.160 --> 04:46:38.160
But it went up though.

04:46:38.160 --> 04:46:40.160
It went up though. That's all I care about.

04:46:40.160 --> 04:46:42.160
Money go up. First hand is drawn face down.

04:46:44.160 --> 04:46:46.160
Thanks, I guess.

04:46:48.160 --> 04:46:50.160
We have five turns. Four discards.

04:46:52.160 --> 04:46:54.160
Hear me out.

04:46:54.160 --> 04:46:56.160
Just go for it.

04:46:58.160 --> 04:47:00.160
Yeah.

04:47:00.160 --> 04:47:02.160
Just go for it.

04:47:04.160 --> 04:47:06.160
Yeah. Okay.

04:47:06.160 --> 04:47:08.160
We got a double ten!

04:47:10.160 --> 04:47:12.160
We got four thousand for that little cheeky move there.

04:47:12.160 --> 04:47:14.160
We'll do the eights and then we'll

04:47:14.160 --> 04:47:16.160
unflip all of these guys as well.

04:47:16.160 --> 04:47:18.160
I know it's not going to be a thing

04:47:18.160 --> 04:47:20.160
but we'll unflip them.

04:47:22.160 --> 04:47:24.160
Beautiful. Stunning.

04:47:24.160 --> 04:47:26.160
Gorgeous.

04:47:26.160 --> 04:47:28.160
You just love this game.

04:47:28.160 --> 04:47:30.160
It goes there. Identify yourself.

04:47:30.160 --> 04:47:32.160
We're actually going to have to do a discard

04:47:32.160 --> 04:47:34.160
because there's nothing we can do.

04:47:34.160 --> 04:47:36.160
That's actually really rare.

04:47:36.160 --> 04:47:38.160
Normally we can always do something every round.

04:47:40.160 --> 04:47:42.160
One, two, three, four, five.

04:47:42.160 --> 04:47:44.160
I know I should keep that but we're literally a thousand off

04:47:44.160 --> 04:47:46.160
so just do a discard.

04:47:46.160 --> 04:47:48.160
If I play it, I get to keep a dollar.

04:47:48.160 --> 04:47:50.160
I get to keep two dollars

04:47:50.160 --> 04:47:52.160
if I don't use the discard

04:47:52.160 --> 04:47:54.160
so I'm just going to play nothing.

04:47:56.160 --> 04:47:58.160
Lucky can give you cash.

04:47:58.160 --> 04:48:00.160
So we're just going to play nothing

04:48:00.160 --> 04:48:02.160
and do a high card or whatever you call it.

04:48:02.160 --> 04:48:04.160
Alright, there we go.

04:48:04.160 --> 04:48:06.160
We got troops.

04:48:06.160 --> 04:48:08.160
Well, then that's it.

04:48:08.160 --> 04:48:10.160
Okay.

04:48:12.160 --> 04:48:14.160
Yay!

04:48:16.160 --> 04:48:18.160
I'll try to finish my tea.

04:48:18.160 --> 04:48:20.160
There we go. 18 for that one round.

04:48:20.160 --> 04:48:22.160
Fantastic.

04:48:22.160 --> 04:48:24.160
Reroll boss blind one time per anti.

04:48:24.160 --> 04:48:26.160
10 bucks though

04:48:26.160 --> 04:48:28.160
to do that.

04:48:28.160 --> 04:48:30.160
If we get a really...

04:48:30.160 --> 04:48:32.160
Choose one of four joker cards.

04:48:32.160 --> 04:48:34.160
No!

04:48:34.160 --> 04:48:36.160
Of course when I pick up tarot cards

04:48:36.160 --> 04:48:38.160
it doesn't give me tarot cards.

04:48:40.160 --> 04:48:42.160
Use run info to check the boss blind.

04:48:42.160 --> 04:48:44.160
Run info?

04:48:44.160 --> 04:48:46.160
Blinds. Wait, can I see what's up ahead?

04:48:48.160 --> 04:48:50.160
Play only one type.

04:48:50.160 --> 04:48:52.160
This is upcoming.

04:48:52.160 --> 04:48:54.160
What's vouchers?

04:48:54.160 --> 04:48:56.160
Oh, this is what I have.

04:48:56.160 --> 04:48:58.160
Vouchers redeem this run.

04:48:58.160 --> 04:49:00.160
Okay.

04:49:00.160 --> 04:49:02.160
I completely forgot I got all these.

04:49:02.160 --> 04:49:04.160
I'm not very smart, I mean.

04:49:04.160 --> 04:49:06.160
No, only one hand, yeah.

04:49:06.160 --> 04:49:08.160
Only one type.

04:49:08.160 --> 04:49:10.160
Play only one hand type this round.

04:49:10.160 --> 04:49:12.160
How does that work?

04:49:12.160 --> 04:49:14.160
How the heck is that supposed to work?

04:49:14.160 --> 04:49:16.160
All flushes?

04:49:20.160 --> 04:49:22.160
One...

04:49:22.160 --> 04:49:24.160
One kind of hand.

04:49:24.160 --> 04:49:26.160
Only for peers.

04:49:26.160 --> 04:49:28.160
Well, better be peers.

04:49:28.160 --> 04:49:30.160
Choose two of up to five playing cards

04:49:30.160 --> 04:49:32.160
to add to the deck.

04:49:32.160 --> 04:49:34.160
I'm not even wanting that, if I'm being honest.

04:49:34.160 --> 04:49:36.160
I'm wanting tarot.

04:49:36.160 --> 04:49:44.160
Do I want this in my back pocket?

04:49:48.160 --> 04:49:50.160
Decisions, decisions.

04:49:50.160 --> 04:49:52.160
Yeah, have it in my back pocket?

04:49:52.160 --> 04:49:54.160
Okay.

04:49:54.160 --> 04:49:56.160
I don't know how to utilize it,

04:49:56.160 --> 04:49:58.160
but I'm not wanting anything else for this.

04:49:58.160 --> 04:50:00.160
Gives a spectral pattern.

04:50:00.160 --> 04:50:02.160
No, I need tarot cards.

04:50:07.160 --> 04:50:10.160
The game's pleasing me dry a little bit here.

04:50:10.160 --> 04:50:12.160
You're not really giving me much to work with.

04:50:12.160 --> 04:50:14.160
Literally a double, and that's it.

04:50:16.160 --> 04:50:18.160
Just play that and get rid of it all.

04:50:18.160 --> 04:50:20.160
Like, the game has not been nice to me.

04:50:20.160 --> 04:50:22.160
Unless I'm missing something obvious,

04:50:22.160 --> 04:50:24.160
that was not a nice pull.

04:50:24.160 --> 04:50:26.160
Heart flush?

04:50:26.160 --> 04:50:28.160
Shit.

04:50:28.160 --> 04:50:30.160
For...

04:50:30.160 --> 04:50:32.160
King, Queen Jack 10.

04:50:32.160 --> 04:50:34.160
So I need an Ace or a Nine.

04:50:36.160 --> 04:50:38.160
I'm so sorry.

04:50:38.160 --> 04:50:40.160
I don't see things the way you see it.

04:50:40.160 --> 04:50:42.160
I could do...

04:50:42.160 --> 04:50:44.160
I could do Jacks, I can't.

04:50:44.160 --> 04:50:46.160
King like that.

04:50:46.160 --> 04:50:48.160
And get rid of the...

04:50:48.160 --> 04:50:50.160
Oh, but four is like a good bonus.

04:50:50.160 --> 04:50:52.160
Like, ever do these, maybe?

04:50:54.160 --> 04:50:56.160
Aren't her pairs worth more than flushes anyway?

04:50:56.160 --> 04:50:58.160
Very plausible.

04:51:00.160 --> 04:51:02.160
My pair is level six right now, so...

04:51:02.160 --> 04:51:04.160
RNG gods?

04:51:04.160 --> 04:51:06.160
Thank you.

04:51:14.160 --> 04:51:16.160
Oh yeah, my pairs are worth way more.

04:51:16.160 --> 04:51:18.160
Shout out to all my pairs.

04:51:18.160 --> 04:51:20.160
Cash out.

04:51:20.160 --> 04:51:22.160
Ooh, what are you?

04:51:22.160 --> 04:51:24.160
Allow straights to be played with gaps in them.

04:51:24.160 --> 04:51:26.160
Well, I'm actually doubled out.

04:51:26.160 --> 04:51:28.160
You're too late to show up.

04:51:28.160 --> 04:51:30.160
I'm already down on doubles.

04:51:30.160 --> 04:51:32.160
Give 20 more chips and a multiplier.

04:51:36.160 --> 04:51:38.160
Well, we're going to get our tarot card multiplier up.

04:51:38.160 --> 04:51:40.160
So...

04:51:40.160 --> 04:51:42.160
It's a hollow joker though.

04:51:42.160 --> 04:51:44.160
Is that what I'm looking at?

04:51:44.160 --> 04:51:46.160
Actually sell the four plus joker and buy the straight cards.

04:51:48.160 --> 04:51:50.160
And buy this one?

04:51:52.160 --> 04:51:54.160
Not the scholar, buy the...

04:51:54.160 --> 04:51:56.160
straight cards.

04:51:56.160 --> 04:51:58.160
The straight card is 10 multiplier.

04:51:58.160 --> 04:52:00.160
Okay, I trust you, Reeflings.

04:52:00.160 --> 04:52:02.160
You're gating me.

04:52:02.160 --> 04:52:04.160
Okay, that's a 10 multiplier.

04:52:04.160 --> 04:52:06.160
Okay, and then we'll do our tarot cards

04:52:06.160 --> 04:52:08.160
because we can get...

04:52:08.160 --> 04:52:10.160
this will go up.

04:52:10.160 --> 04:52:12.160
Enhance to two lucky cards.

04:52:12.160 --> 04:52:14.160
Enhance us to the bonus cards

04:52:14.160 --> 04:52:16.160
or create a random joker.

04:52:16.160 --> 04:52:18.160
I think...

04:52:18.160 --> 04:52:20.160
we'll do lucky cards.

04:52:22.160 --> 04:52:24.160
Yeah, let's make these two lucky.

04:52:24.160 --> 04:52:26.160
Let's make these two lucky.

04:52:28.160 --> 04:52:30.160
It could be good, but you probably have to sell the drunk jack.

04:52:32.160 --> 04:52:34.160
This game is actually insane

04:52:34.160 --> 04:52:36.160
with how deep it goes.

04:52:36.160 --> 04:52:38.160
It's fantastic.

04:52:38.160 --> 04:52:40.160
It's honestly fantastic.

04:52:40.160 --> 04:52:42.160
I'm loving it.

04:52:42.160 --> 04:52:44.160
So I can get 19 bucks back.

04:52:44.160 --> 04:52:46.160
I can get a planet.

04:52:46.160 --> 04:52:48.160
I can do the lucky card again.

04:52:48.160 --> 04:52:50.160
I'm tempted to do the lucky card.

04:52:50.160 --> 04:52:52.160
I really enjoy the luck.

04:52:52.160 --> 04:52:54.160
I really enjoy the luck factor

04:52:54.160 --> 04:52:56.160
because

04:52:56.160 --> 04:52:58.160
a 20 multiplier is insane.

04:53:00.160 --> 04:53:02.160
Priestess gives you two planets though.

04:53:10.160 --> 04:53:12.160
I love the luck factor,

04:53:12.160 --> 04:53:14.160
but you're right.

04:53:14.160 --> 04:53:16.160
Two planets, I could upgrade everything.

04:53:16.160 --> 04:53:18.160
Well, not everything.

04:53:18.160 --> 04:53:20.160
I could upgrade

04:53:20.160 --> 04:53:22.160
and play.

04:53:22.160 --> 04:53:24.160
Priestess might actually be better in this situation.

04:53:26.160 --> 04:53:28.160
Okay, okay.

04:53:28.160 --> 04:53:30.160
What we got? We've got four of a kind

04:53:30.160 --> 04:53:32.160
and a full house. I mean, we're just going to utilize them.

04:53:32.160 --> 04:53:34.160
I don't have a problem with utilizing them.

04:53:36.160 --> 04:53:38.160
Right, and then we'll go next.

04:53:38.160 --> 04:53:40.160
I am not interested in you.

04:53:42.160 --> 04:53:44.160
Every played card permanently gains five chips.

04:53:44.160 --> 04:53:46.160
I'm already on that.

04:53:46.160 --> 04:53:48.160
So what are you? Allow straights to be played

04:53:48.160 --> 04:53:50.160
in a gap.

04:53:52.160 --> 04:53:54.160
Wait.

04:53:54.160 --> 04:53:56.160
That example works?

04:53:56.160 --> 04:53:58.160
Wait, it's not like five, four, three,

04:53:58.160 --> 04:54:00.160
one and...

04:54:04.160 --> 04:54:06.160
Wait, I'm just going to be doing straights

04:54:06.160 --> 04:54:08.160
all day long then.

04:54:08.160 --> 04:54:10.160
Am I misunderstanding?

04:54:10.160 --> 04:54:12.160
We rose in the next shop for zero.

04:54:14.160 --> 04:54:16.160
And a 10 plus multiplier on top.

04:54:16.160 --> 04:54:18.160
Oh, is it the 10 multi?

04:54:18.160 --> 04:54:20.160
That is what we're wanting it for.

04:54:22.160 --> 04:54:24.160
So you can play very weird straights now.

04:54:24.160 --> 04:54:26.160
My brain can hardly

04:54:26.160 --> 04:54:28.160
like, comprehend. So what?

04:54:28.160 --> 04:54:30.160
One, two,

04:54:30.160 --> 04:54:32.160
skip a few.

04:54:32.160 --> 04:54:34.160
Ten, skip eight.

04:54:34.160 --> 04:54:36.160
No way!

04:54:38.160 --> 04:54:40.160
That's redonkulous.

04:54:40.160 --> 04:54:42.160
That doesn't make sense,

04:54:42.160 --> 04:54:44.160
but it does!

04:54:46.160 --> 04:54:48.160
It just works!

04:54:48.160 --> 04:54:50.160
All right, Todd Howard.

04:54:50.160 --> 04:54:52.160
You can't down there, good sir.

04:54:52.160 --> 04:54:54.160
Hurry up with my Skyrim six already.

04:54:54.160 --> 04:54:56.160
I'm winning.

04:54:56.160 --> 04:54:58.160
Whoa, that's mean-blowing!

04:55:00.160 --> 04:55:02.160
Eleven, ten.

04:55:02.160 --> 04:55:04.160
Eight.

04:55:04.160 --> 04:55:06.160
Well, that's ten, technically.

04:55:06.160 --> 04:55:08.160
Nine and eight. Wow!

04:55:08.160 --> 04:55:10.160
How bizarre!

04:55:10.160 --> 04:55:12.160
I'm like twiddling

04:55:12.160 --> 04:55:14.160
my hair right now

04:55:14.160 --> 04:55:16.160
in between my fingers.

04:55:16.160 --> 04:55:18.160
Like, what?

04:55:18.160 --> 04:55:20.160
How strange.

04:55:20.160 --> 04:55:22.160
So king, queen,

04:55:22.160 --> 04:55:24.160
jack, ten, nine,

04:55:24.160 --> 04:55:26.160
seven.

04:55:26.160 --> 04:55:28.160
And what? And then we need a five

04:55:28.160 --> 04:55:30.160
or six?

04:55:30.160 --> 04:55:32.160
What?

04:55:34.160 --> 04:55:36.160
All right, okay, okay, hold on.

04:55:36.160 --> 04:55:38.160
What have we got? We've got doubles.

04:55:38.160 --> 04:55:40.160
Let's do doubles.

04:55:40.160 --> 04:55:42.160
That's blowing my mind.

04:55:42.160 --> 04:55:44.160
Wait, have I got straight again?

04:55:44.160 --> 04:55:46.160
No. Wait, no.

04:55:46.160 --> 04:55:48.160
Have I?

04:55:48.160 --> 04:55:50.160
King, queen, jack, ten, nine,

04:55:50.160 --> 04:55:52.160
eight, seven. No!

04:55:52.160 --> 04:55:54.160
Wait, that's so hard!

04:55:54.160 --> 04:55:56.160
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

04:55:56.160 --> 04:55:58.160
That's like so weird!

04:55:58.160 --> 04:56:00.160
How common is that card?

04:56:00.160 --> 04:56:02.160
How common is that card?

04:56:14.160 --> 04:56:16.160
Okay, so there's

04:56:16.160 --> 04:56:18.160
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

04:56:20.160 --> 04:56:22.160
It worked!

04:56:22.160 --> 04:56:24.160
Why does it work?

04:56:24.160 --> 04:56:26.160
Wait, this card is so OP.

04:56:26.160 --> 04:56:28.160
Danny, you put my stonks in the streets?

04:56:28.160 --> 04:56:30.160
I think Danny, you put my stonks in the streets.

04:56:32.160 --> 04:56:34.160
King, queen, jack,

04:56:34.160 --> 04:56:36.160
ten, nine.

04:56:36.160 --> 04:56:38.160
Okay, I don't have that.

04:56:38.160 --> 04:56:40.160
Five, six, seven, eight, nine,

04:56:40.160 --> 04:56:42.160
ten. Okay, so I don't have it that way.

04:56:44.160 --> 04:56:46.160
Go in all in on streets.

04:56:46.160 --> 04:56:48.160
I think so.

04:56:48.160 --> 04:56:50.160
I think we need to maybe swap off

04:56:50.160 --> 04:56:52.160
repair. Oh no, but that's got a ten plus on it.

04:56:54.160 --> 04:56:56.160
Does that activate in general?

04:56:56.160 --> 04:56:58.160
Okay, I'm going to get rid of all the...

04:56:58.160 --> 04:57:00.160
Oh wait, no, I don't want to get rid of them.

04:57:00.160 --> 04:57:02.160
I don't think so. I just want to get rid of the kings.

04:57:02.160 --> 04:57:04.160
Because we're like so close to another street.

04:57:04.160 --> 04:57:06.160
Oh, it's the end of the round.

04:57:06.160 --> 04:57:08.160
Oh.

04:57:08.160 --> 04:57:10.160
How bizarre, right?

04:57:10.160 --> 04:57:12.160
Let me finish this game.

04:57:12.160 --> 04:57:14.160
It's cold!

04:57:14.160 --> 04:57:16.160
I can't help it.

04:57:16.160 --> 04:57:18.160
Remaining hand, money, interest.

04:57:18.160 --> 04:57:20.160
Oh, I got rid of my...

04:57:20.160 --> 04:57:22.160
No.

04:57:22.160 --> 04:57:24.160
Why did that not...

04:57:24.160 --> 04:57:26.160
Why did you not activate?

04:57:26.160 --> 04:57:28.160
Earn two bucks

04:57:28.160 --> 04:57:30.160
per discard if no discards are used.

04:57:30.160 --> 04:57:32.160
Oh, if none of them are used.

04:57:32.160 --> 04:57:34.160
Okay, at all.

04:57:34.160 --> 04:57:36.160
Right, what's going on here?

04:57:38.160 --> 04:57:40.160
I've already had you, so

04:57:40.160 --> 04:57:42.160
I don't want you.

04:57:42.160 --> 04:57:44.160
There is another to make it that you only need floor cards

04:57:44.160 --> 04:57:46.160
to make flushes and streets.

04:57:46.160 --> 04:57:48.160
The Joker has literally changed the entire game.

04:57:50.160 --> 04:57:52.160
We have...we've got a turret card

04:57:52.160 --> 04:57:54.160
so we can increase our multiplier at

04:57:54.160 --> 04:57:56.160
8 to 9.

04:57:56.160 --> 04:57:58.160
Yes, please, sir.

04:57:58.160 --> 04:58:00.160
What have we got? Planets.

04:58:00.160 --> 04:58:02.160
Joker, we don't need.

04:58:02.160 --> 04:58:04.160
Double's money.

04:58:04.160 --> 04:58:06.160
That gives us 20.

04:58:06.160 --> 04:58:08.160
That would give us full economy.

04:58:10.160 --> 04:58:12.160
Wait, that gives us two more turret cards?

04:58:12.160 --> 04:58:14.160
Which gives us even more of a multiplier.

04:58:14.160 --> 04:58:16.160
Emperor.

04:58:16.160 --> 04:58:18.160
Emperor?

04:58:18.160 --> 04:58:20.160
Emperor.

04:58:20.160 --> 04:58:22.160
Yeah, okay.

04:58:22.160 --> 04:58:24.160
That turns us to what?

04:58:24.160 --> 04:58:26.160
10?

04:58:26.160 --> 04:58:28.160
Wait, that turns us to 11?

04:58:28.160 --> 04:58:30.160
Enhance something into a wealth card.

04:58:30.160 --> 04:58:32.160
Use the wheel.

04:58:32.160 --> 04:58:34.160
I never got it.

04:58:34.160 --> 04:58:36.160
But is that 10 now? Enhances one selected card

04:58:36.160 --> 04:58:38.160
into a wild card.

04:58:38.160 --> 04:58:40.160
I don't know what a wild card is.

04:58:40.160 --> 04:58:42.160
But in Binding of Isaac,

04:58:42.160 --> 04:58:44.160
we've got a wild card.

04:58:44.160 --> 04:58:46.160
You hear an audio cue and the guy goes wild card.

04:58:46.160 --> 04:58:48.160
I just thought you should know that.

04:58:50.160 --> 04:58:52.160
Right, we will pick a planet to upgrade as well

04:58:52.160 --> 04:58:54.160
because

04:58:54.160 --> 04:58:56.160
I guess we want straight.

04:58:56.160 --> 04:58:58.160
Not straight flush.

04:58:58.160 --> 04:59:00.160
That's very unlikely

04:59:00.160 --> 04:59:02.160
but a straight wild card.

04:59:02.160 --> 04:59:04.160
Sorry, I'm stuck in my head now.

04:59:04.160 --> 04:59:06.160
Saturn.

04:59:06.160 --> 04:59:08.160
Cumberboard Saturn.

04:59:08.160 --> 04:59:10.160
Right, you...

04:59:10.160 --> 04:59:12.160
You don't have a multiplier with your foil.

04:59:12.160 --> 04:59:14.160
You have 50 chips

04:59:14.160 --> 04:59:16.160
which I'm not really sure.

04:59:16.160 --> 04:59:18.160
Saturn.

04:59:18.160 --> 04:59:20.160
Sell the drunk Joker.

04:59:20.160 --> 04:59:22.160
The drunk Joker.

04:59:22.160 --> 04:59:24.160
I have

04:59:24.160 --> 04:59:26.160
the drunk card.

04:59:26.160 --> 04:59:28.160
Sell the drunk card.

04:59:30.160 --> 04:59:32.160
I would pick the foil Joker

04:59:32.160 --> 04:59:34.160
and switch it for the discard.

04:59:34.160 --> 04:59:36.160
Okay, thank you.

04:59:36.160 --> 04:59:38.160
You and you come.

04:59:38.160 --> 04:59:40.160
God ranks give chips when...

04:59:40.160 --> 04:59:42.160
Okay, okay.

04:59:42.160 --> 04:59:44.160
I comprehend interesting.

04:59:44.160 --> 04:59:46.160
I like it. I'll use the lover's card

04:59:46.160 --> 04:59:48.160
and then our multiplier will go to what?

04:59:48.160 --> 04:59:50.160
Ten.

04:59:50.160 --> 04:59:52.160
Fantastic.

04:59:52.160 --> 04:59:54.160
Fan.

04:59:54.160 --> 04:59:56.160
Chips.

04:59:56.160 --> 04:59:58.160
That's kind of scary.

04:59:58.160 --> 05:00:00.160
Play only one hand this round.

05:00:00.160 --> 05:00:02.160
I'm a bit nervous.

05:00:02.160 --> 05:00:04.160
Alright.

05:00:08.160 --> 05:00:10.160
Enhance one into a wild card.

05:00:10.160 --> 05:00:12.160
One hand type.

05:00:12.160 --> 05:00:14.160
So...

05:00:14.160 --> 05:00:16.160
Go with either pairs or straights.

05:00:16.160 --> 05:00:18.160
Play only straight.

05:00:20.160 --> 05:00:22.160
I don't have a straight.

05:00:22.160 --> 05:00:24.160
No ASMR.

05:00:24.160 --> 05:00:26.160
No, it's coming. Once we redirect into Azure

05:00:26.160 --> 05:00:28.160
I'm doing my ASMR.

05:00:28.160 --> 05:00:30.160
You might hear the birds outside though.

05:00:30.160 --> 05:00:32.160
That's only...

05:00:32.160 --> 05:00:34.160
That's only done so I didn't ASMR a bit later.

05:00:34.160 --> 05:00:36.160
Hand type.

05:00:36.160 --> 05:00:38.160
You can just play straights.

05:00:38.160 --> 05:00:40.160
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

05:00:40.160 --> 05:00:42.160
six, five, four.

05:00:42.160 --> 05:00:44.160
Right, so I need to get rid of

05:00:44.160 --> 05:00:46.160
all of these.

05:00:46.160 --> 05:00:48.160
Even the four?

05:00:48.160 --> 05:00:50.160
Wild card.

05:00:50.160 --> 05:00:52.160
Sorry, that's really stuck in my head.

05:00:52.160 --> 05:00:54.160
I'll discard these

05:00:54.160 --> 05:00:56.160
and we'll go for a flush.

05:00:56.160 --> 05:00:58.160
Discard some sevens.

05:00:58.160 --> 05:01:02.160
Ten, nine, eight, sevens.

05:01:02.160 --> 05:01:04.160
Help.

05:01:04.160 --> 05:01:06.160
Jeez, I'm a waste. Do you guys not want me

05:01:06.160 --> 05:01:08.160
to win or something? What's going on here?

05:01:08.160 --> 05:01:10.160
King is very far away from ten.

05:01:12.160 --> 05:01:14.160
Wait, I got a straight. Stop. Stop.

05:01:14.160 --> 05:01:16.160
Where?

05:01:16.160 --> 05:01:18.160
I don't have a straight.

05:01:18.160 --> 05:01:20.160
King.

05:01:20.160 --> 05:01:22.160
Queen. Jack.

05:01:24.160 --> 05:01:26.160
Ace, king, ten.

05:01:29.160 --> 05:01:32.160
Wait, queen and joker.

05:01:32.160 --> 05:01:34.160
Queen and jack get skipped

05:01:34.160 --> 05:01:36.160
between these two?

05:01:36.160 --> 05:01:38.160
No, you said a flush.

05:01:38.160 --> 05:01:40.160
Wait, never mind. Yeah.

05:01:40.160 --> 05:01:42.160
Toss one of the nine and keep a ten.

05:01:42.160 --> 05:01:44.160
She wants straights,

05:01:44.160 --> 05:01:46.160
not flushes. No, you can't make a straight.

05:01:46.160 --> 05:01:48.160
I didn't think so.

05:01:50.160 --> 05:01:52.160
So ditch this nine and these two.

05:01:52.160 --> 05:01:54.160
Discard nine of hearts, discard four.

05:01:54.160 --> 05:01:56.160
But not three? Why not three?

05:01:56.160 --> 05:01:58.160
Why not three?

05:01:58.160 --> 05:02:00.160
Wait a minute, why did you not mention the three?

05:02:04.160 --> 05:02:06.160
I don't know.

05:02:08.160 --> 05:02:10.160
I'm going to need to make a play.

05:02:10.160 --> 05:02:12.160
My discards are getting off.

05:02:12.160 --> 05:02:14.160
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

05:02:16.160 --> 05:02:18.160
Yeah, okay, right.

05:02:18.160 --> 05:02:20.160
Lovers, what's a wild card though?

05:02:20.160 --> 05:02:22.160
That I put ten on?

05:02:22.160 --> 05:02:24.160
That I just randomly put the ace on a wild card?

05:02:24.160 --> 05:02:26.160
Sure, what does it do? I don't know.

05:02:28.160 --> 05:02:30.160
Can be used as any suit.

05:02:30.160 --> 05:02:32.160
Sure.

05:02:32.160 --> 05:02:34.160
Play.

05:02:40.160 --> 05:02:42.160
Nine, eight, seven.

05:02:42.160 --> 05:02:44.160
Shit.

05:02:44.160 --> 05:02:46.160
We've, oh no, we've fucked it.

05:02:46.160 --> 05:02:48.160
We've fucked it.

05:02:52.160 --> 05:02:54.160
We've ballsed it up.

05:02:56.160 --> 05:02:58.160
I've ballsed it up because I used so many discards.

05:02:58.160 --> 05:03:00.160
Used the last discard.

05:03:00.160 --> 05:03:02.160
Reroll a three and a two.

05:03:02.160 --> 05:03:04.160
Man, you're actually getting awful draws.

05:03:04.160 --> 05:03:06.160
Streamer Luck can only lead stretch so far.

05:03:08.160 --> 05:03:10.160
Discard all the threes and twos.

05:03:10.160 --> 05:03:12.160
And the four?

05:03:12.160 --> 05:03:14.160
Or not the four?

05:03:14.160 --> 05:03:16.160
Jobu Nogo.

05:03:16.160 --> 05:03:18.160
Thank you for the membership.

05:03:18.160 --> 05:03:20.160
I appreciate it.

05:03:20.160 --> 05:03:22.160
You have a good basis though.

05:03:22.160 --> 05:03:24.160
For a lot of straights.

05:03:24.160 --> 05:03:26.160
So get rid of this side. Leave the four.

05:03:26.160 --> 05:03:28.160
I'd keep the four, not the four.

05:03:28.160 --> 05:03:30.160
Just the threes and the twos.

05:03:30.160 --> 05:03:32.160
Last discard.

05:03:32.160 --> 05:03:34.160
It's either make or break.

05:03:34.160 --> 05:03:36.160
Um...

05:03:42.160 --> 05:03:44.160
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four!

05:03:50.160 --> 05:03:52.160
Ok, ok let them get up, let them get up, let them get up!

05:03:52.160 --> 05:03:54.160
Hold on.

05:03:54.160 --> 05:03:56.160
Oh, thank goodness, that was not fun.

05:03:56.160 --> 05:03:58.160
I didn't enjoy that.

05:03:58.160 --> 05:04:00.160
Don't do that to me again.

05:04:00.160 --> 05:04:08.800
absolutely we'll muck around with tarot cards no problem wait what's this one

05:04:08.800 --> 05:04:18.060
consumable slot so I can have even more tarot cards mega arcane use two

05:04:18.060 --> 05:04:22.980
tarots right we're gonna buy and use the planets right now got a bit of

05:04:22.980 --> 05:04:28.540
Uranus please use and a bit of Venus please use for three of a kind

05:04:28.540 --> 05:04:32.740
unfortunately didn't roll Saturn which is what we were wanting but that's fine

05:04:32.740 --> 05:04:41.740
tarot open up please come to me right ladies and gentlemen we can double money

05:04:41.740 --> 05:04:47.700
for a max of 20 which we can achieve create a card destroy two cards increase

05:04:47.700 --> 05:04:55.440
the rank and mid game or enhance one selected card into a stone card when

05:04:55.440 --> 05:05:02.520
can you use vouchers mid game I mean no vouchers always occur oh actually yeah I

05:05:02.520 --> 05:05:10.200
don't know when the director's cut could be activated 20 is 20 you're you are

05:05:10.200 --> 05:05:14.160
factually correct I am inclined to agree actually don't want to destroy

05:05:14.160 --> 05:05:19.160
anything because if we've now got this weird suit thing going on destroying is

05:05:19.160 --> 05:05:23.160
bad we don't want Joker that's useless we don't really need to change anything

05:05:23.320 --> 05:05:27.440
into the same thing because we're going for a weird flush so yeah hermit is our

05:05:27.440 --> 05:05:34.200
only option there we go 20 bucks right not you not you again don't want to

05:05:34.200 --> 05:05:41.280
destroy cards or create a Joker wow okay this is useless is this a skip all

05:05:41.280 --> 05:05:49.520
but but our multiplier you know what I can take it I don't want to actually use

05:05:49.560 --> 05:05:54.320
it I thought it was gonna let me take it and then I could just sell it yeah I

05:05:54.320 --> 05:06:04.960
thought I could take it I destroy high and low no the problem is we have what's

05:06:04.960 --> 05:06:11.240
called shortcut it allows straights to be inaccurate you could bump the three and

05:06:11.240 --> 05:06:18.160
fours to four and five centering the value you know what you like beyond a

05:06:18.160 --> 05:06:24.440
certain what do you want me to do you can bump the three and fours wait so

05:06:24.440 --> 05:06:32.800
should I make the three or four and then that would raise the bar

05:06:32.800 --> 05:06:43.720
increase the strip the rank increases rank of the two cards selected by one

05:06:43.720 --> 05:06:53.000
card okay okay that was good we are now 14 multiply which is fantastic we don't

05:06:53.000 --> 05:06:57.920
need a Joker we don't need a consumable slot we're actually about to hit max

05:06:57.960 --> 05:07:03.320
economy which is fantastic for us because our little discards this one

05:07:03.320 --> 05:07:11.360
really isn't hitting it isn't hitting as hard anymore so I might want to

05:07:11.360 --> 05:07:17.960
replace but gives us a negative Joker slot on the domestic is an extra slot so

05:07:17.960 --> 05:07:25.760
I can't get rid of it right next round delayed gratifications and I am

05:07:25.800 --> 05:07:33.280
learning and make a standard pack no I want that rocked cards right we can

05:07:33.280 --> 05:07:37.800
still do our little Duble V at the moment was at nine wait hold on five six

05:07:37.800 --> 05:07:48.840
seven eight nine ten oh wait that's a flush I think I'm better doing my pairs

05:07:48.840 --> 05:07:56.400
yeah pairs are better right now so just throw them away and go for a little

05:07:56.400 --> 05:08:01.640
flush I don't know maybe it's terrible sorry for folk that sorry for folk that

05:08:01.640 --> 05:08:08.560
but I'm trying well I got 13k for that yeah seven six five four three two one

05:08:08.560 --> 05:08:12.480
of course I'm not gonna card that would be too easy let's just do doubles I think

05:08:12.480 --> 05:08:17.840
we've got all we can do a full house and yeah because a single pair is heavily

05:08:17.840 --> 05:08:23.000
boosted single pair please better than two pairs wait

05:08:23.160 --> 05:08:37.400
single pair who says single pair please better who says run info how do you do

05:08:37.400 --> 05:08:44.640
the mass straight flush two pair is 60 times four

05:08:47.840 --> 05:08:53.600
oh wow wait it was 85 times seven that's a big number

05:08:53.600 --> 05:08:59.560
wait oh no don't maybe the math oh no you're right a single pair is far

05:08:59.560 --> 05:09:08.240
stronger wow okay and what are you odd numbers so a double seven is stronger

05:09:08.240 --> 05:09:15.160
than a Wow this game wait wait wait let me I know give me I need to some

05:09:15.160 --> 05:09:22.840
freaking math in my head I'm like that's a bigger number you're right 11,000

05:09:22.840 --> 05:09:28.680
for two singular pair wow we need that half cut off card again and we're laughing

05:09:28.680 --> 05:09:40.280
to the bank hmm right we've got 69 bucks play played face card gives 30 right

05:09:40.280 --> 05:09:44.840
I'm gonna buy this because our economy is good and we've got two tarot cards

05:09:45.120 --> 05:09:50.920
let's do you thank you redeemed thank you right jumbo what see what we're

05:09:50.920 --> 05:09:57.760
dealing with give us a suit right no to the glass card and the last thing we

05:09:57.760 --> 05:10:01.280
used was strength which I've already forgotten what does it in this game I

05:10:01.280 --> 05:10:07.680
think strength increases your health by one in Isaac as well as a speed and

05:10:07.680 --> 05:10:16.640
possibly damage 69 nice big bank of our it says there oh increases rank of

05:10:16.640 --> 05:10:26.640
two selected cards ah so we are officially created a five and four so

05:10:26.640 --> 05:10:32.560
can we just do it again anyway two selected car no enhance one into a

05:10:32.560 --> 05:10:38.720
wild card sorry convert no right actually yeah the fool is the best thing

05:10:38.720 --> 05:10:44.800
we can probably do right here so we made an artificial five that isn't really a

05:10:44.800 --> 05:11:00.800
five but we can bump up to a six so there should be a double five okay hearts

05:11:00.800 --> 05:11:09.760
have a double five which is fine so you have more fives than normal and less

05:11:09.760 --> 05:11:17.160
threes so I don't want to read you don't have to worry too much if you use the

05:11:17.160 --> 05:11:30.560
fuel it will go back to the shop yeah and spades doesn't have a three I'm not

05:11:30.560 --> 05:11:34.840
smart enough to do it

05:11:34.840 --> 05:11:47.760
huh my dumb very dumb very dumb it's okay I'm allowed to be dumb make two lucky

05:11:47.760 --> 05:11:57.640
cards hearts or a steel card chariot oh this is hard because I'm trying to do

05:11:58.360 --> 05:12:04.880
what a straight so having a chariot on standby I don't know if I'm better because

05:12:04.880 --> 05:12:09.360
I'm going to be going through so many cards it might be better to have two

05:12:09.360 --> 05:12:21.000
lucky cards steal the three really and then hope the other cards are straight

05:12:21.000 --> 05:12:23.560
when I get them

05:12:26.120 --> 05:12:33.480
not do this now oh I can do that now hold on right what my two strengths use

05:12:33.480 --> 05:12:37.880
strength here first yes sorry I noticed I was gonna do that and what is steel

05:12:37.880 --> 05:12:43.960
steel is a 1.5 multiplier if it just sits in your hand like you don't utilize it

05:12:43.960 --> 05:12:52.120
it gives a big thing use strength on three and four I guess since they're low

05:12:52.120 --> 05:12:57.640
numbers we want to bump everything upwards of five so we can always push

05:12:57.640 --> 05:13:04.040
towards and you can save strength using as an emergency the multiplier though

05:13:04.040 --> 05:13:10.520
we're at 15 multiplier just on fortune teller so I'm just gonna go balls to the

05:13:10.520 --> 05:13:18.240
wall with it we're now at 16 multiplier right and then we'll lose oh someone

05:13:18.240 --> 05:13:25.000
wants me to steal you can save now well I've already used it now strength on five

05:13:25.000 --> 05:13:34.960
and four what about multi steal the four okay I'm doing it I'm doing as a

05:13:34.960 --> 05:13:40.320
reflander man we're now 17 multiply which is fantastic four of a kind I'm not

05:13:40.320 --> 05:13:48.280
even going for you let's go next please nah I don't need free jokers I've got

05:13:48.280 --> 05:13:53.920
quite an interesting joker right King Queen Jack 1098 well there you go

05:13:53.920 --> 05:14:07.880
straight already yes yes 13,000 for that what we already got a little baby

05:14:07.880 --> 05:14:14.920
straight over here oh no we don't close to no cigar and these Kings are gonna

05:14:14.920 --> 05:14:21.000
give insanely good stuff but the I'm so close to getting something here I'm

05:14:21.000 --> 05:14:25.800
wondering if I should just throw that away and go for like a low straight I do

05:14:25.800 --> 05:14:29.520
have a pair of Kings oh wait yeah that's right I have a pair shut up tell my

05:14:29.520 --> 05:14:34.360
pairs I still have a pair boom because I'd leveled up pairs so much going all

05:14:34.360 --> 05:14:43.680
in with them right King Queen Jack 10 I don't have a baby pair I have three

05:14:43.680 --> 05:14:53.720
rounds so I'm not very stressed out about it I'm just gonna play this pair here

05:14:53.720 --> 05:14:57.680
and kind of clear out the inventory and try and go high for a bit because I did

05:14:57.680 --> 05:15:03.520
put my money into high like making other cards at a higher value so yes not

05:15:03.560 --> 05:15:07.120
problem not problem we're getting there delayed gratification 21 bucks don't

05:15:07.120 --> 05:15:12.800
mind if I do oh this joker gains two Maltese of hand played contains two

05:15:12.800 --> 05:15:26.800
pair brah we're trying to swap straight I need tarot cars give me tarot yes I

05:15:26.800 --> 05:15:38.840
can buy diamonds the chariot oh wait enhance one slighted card into a steel

05:15:38.840 --> 05:15:43.960
card I wouldn't mind doing that again honestly creates up to two random well

05:15:43.960 --> 05:15:48.280
that's even more the Emperor's just infinite glitch seven yeah what's it

05:15:48.280 --> 05:15:54.000
okay glass car and don't actually want to use it on a wild car oh wait oh no I'm

05:15:54.080 --> 05:16:00.080
inventory I actually don't want to make a glass card enhance one selected card

05:16:00.080 --> 05:16:11.120
into a gold card if I buy this oh oh wait I can hold three oh my gosh I'm so

05:16:11.120 --> 05:16:16.280
smart choose up to one of three playing cards add to the deck let's give it a

05:16:17.240 --> 05:16:27.120
peach create a planet card for final played poker hand around if held in hand

05:16:27.120 --> 05:16:34.640
must have room I mean a 10 is high and either way it's like good if we get any

05:16:34.640 --> 05:16:39.160
more cards that are in the higher end of things that's just a free Saturn got it

05:16:39.480 --> 05:16:46.600
say less say less are we considering this Joker I don't think so it says two

05:16:46.600 --> 05:16:52.160
pairs but we're doing straights from around here so no thank you we're going

05:16:52.160 --> 05:16:56.240
to go ham using all of these and then we are going to get a 20 multiplier from

05:16:56.240 --> 05:17:04.440
fortune teller alone the pants might be better than your right most Joker this

05:17:04.600 --> 05:17:11.600
good this gives chips but not multiplayer I mean you might be right this

05:17:11.600 --> 05:17:18.720
just gives chips but the multiplayer is so much better I wouldn't I wouldn't give

05:17:18.720 --> 05:17:24.800
odd Todd I if anything I'd actually sell hiker isn't hiker not adding so much to

05:17:24.800 --> 05:17:32.840
the game because I got him at the start that gives one point five on the multi

05:17:32.840 --> 05:17:39.440
to hikers add in a lot of chips in the background hikers still very valuable I

05:17:39.440 --> 05:17:42.680
think because I had him at the start is valuable if he showed up late game

05:17:42.680 --> 05:17:48.280
completely agree with you like no and that's the 10 multiplayer not getting

05:17:48.280 --> 05:17:52.120
rid of that definitely not getting rid of that so really it is as odd Todd is

05:17:52.120 --> 05:18:02.040
goner and but hiker doesn't add much now slide joker is probably the worst

05:18:02.040 --> 05:18:11.000
what I've got right now but he's a 10 holographic 10 multiplier but you could

05:18:11.000 --> 05:18:15.240
survive without him right now hiker added the value already doesn't go away

05:18:15.240 --> 05:18:25.400
right even after you sell it 1.5 versus 10 chips okay I think you're right it's

05:18:25.400 --> 05:18:34.120
either hiker or odd Todd too this is a situation where any of the choices might

05:18:34.120 --> 05:18:40.800
be good because I am doing so much straight stuff like with straights it

05:18:40.800 --> 05:18:45.320
might be better to keep odd Todd and get rid of the hiker since he's just he's

05:18:45.320 --> 05:18:52.840
very he's doing increasing very slowly so I am gonna make a mistake and pick

05:18:52.840 --> 05:18:56.680
hiker but that's my gut is telling me hiker doesn't make sense at this point

05:18:56.680 --> 05:19:02.520
in time the Joker games to a multiplier of played hands contain two pairs so

05:19:02.520 --> 05:19:09.960
we're gonna do a few pairs on purpose on poor pause and we will also utilize all

05:19:09.960 --> 05:19:21.400
these cards and so we oh it's the last run base chips and multis are halved the

05:19:21.400 --> 05:19:36.760
flint okay I want to keep you nine eight seven good thing you have a lot of

05:19:36.760 --> 05:19:47.560
bonuses yes all right what's going on we're here well okay I am just gonna use

05:19:47.560 --> 05:19:58.120
these like no but is it lovers because what do you do can be used as a any suit

05:19:58.120 --> 05:20:03.520
it enhance the card into a golden one I'm just using it on random there's not

05:20:03.560 --> 05:20:11.360
really a logic to it and you're you 20 now and a glass card I really don't like

05:20:11.360 --> 05:20:18.000
the idea surely the first glass card I ever use will not actually destroy the

05:20:18.000 --> 05:20:28.120
card well we added an artificial 10 so really we should destroy a 10 right I'll

05:20:28.120 --> 05:20:32.240
do five twos and then if an attend shows up with added an artificial one that

05:20:32.240 --> 05:20:50.160
doesn't oh let's see what we look for round one right King Queen Jack skip eight

05:20:50.160 --> 05:20:57.760
nine that's a straight I'm gonna destroy the three right now so it doesn't matter

05:20:57.760 --> 05:21:06.400
if it gets destroyed oh wow actually stayed oh I didn't understand what that

05:21:06.400 --> 05:21:10.880
was gonna do like the nine chips three bucks if you get to keep it in your hand

05:21:10.880 --> 05:21:14.580
though I wanted to keep this in my hand creates the planet card for the final

05:21:14.580 --> 05:21:27.860
plate poker hand all around if held in hand play if held in hand

05:21:27.860 --> 05:21:42.700
two pairs play and then we can upgrade sat and it was a net Saturn Saturn oh it's

05:21:42.700 --> 05:21:51.020
Uranus shoot oh that's two pair multiplier though that's not bad at all yeah sure thank

05:21:51.020 --> 05:21:56.700
you right what's this all card impacts are cheaper yes please let's redeem that

05:21:56.700 --> 05:22:05.500
now so we can fire sale oh that's a good one hand size goes up by one if poker

05:22:05.500 --> 05:22:11.500
hand is a straight flush no that's too rare even I've never done that but we're

05:22:11.500 --> 05:22:22.180
tarot carded out the wazoo what we got increase ranked destroy convert I guess

05:22:22.180 --> 05:22:32.620
increase rank and keep everything increase rank oh wait sorry I'll try and

05:22:32.620 --> 05:22:37.540
push everything up on the other side of the board and then we can use two tarot

05:22:37.540 --> 05:22:44.740
cards which again is gonna make this guy go out the wazoo Joker stone parts

05:22:44.740 --> 05:22:56.740
planet our 16 bucks back I want to say planet yeah planet come on give me what

05:22:56.740 --> 05:23:07.900
I need four of a kind sure and then airs full house sure right well got 16 bucks

05:23:07.900 --> 05:23:15.420
Joker don't need stone don't want don't want right fit 16 boxes 16 bucks what we

05:23:15.420 --> 05:23:23.860
are 24 multiplier it's going up we're not gonna oh we can't re-roll we're above

05:23:23.860 --> 05:23:31.860
50 one re-roll I don't want to use it though

05:23:32.860 --> 05:23:37.540
we're just gonna upgrade everything right one more one more re-roll

05:23:37.540 --> 05:23:46.940
goodness goodness to pair yes okay next round we're at 50 we're at the top next

05:23:46.940 --> 05:23:53.460
no we're cuz the economy is good we don't need it you know we don't need it I'd buy

05:23:53.460 --> 05:23:59.740
the stars just above fortune teller I think I have to use it but I don't want

05:23:59.740 --> 05:24:03.100
to oh wait does it make a difference if I shuffle decks it doesn't make a

05:24:03.100 --> 05:24:09.620
difference I don't go for straight flushes all right we're gonna keep that

05:24:09.620 --> 05:24:15.100
juicy tens sitting high and dry wait if I do I think I actually need to

05:24:15.100 --> 05:24:21.460
purposely do two pairs two pair yes and then odd is gonna activate on the five

05:24:21.460 --> 05:24:28.420
is Jack considered an odd I guess so I love straight that fine now to do right

05:24:28.420 --> 05:24:34.020
if it okay so this gun yeah okay okay I'm happy with the two pairs let's go

05:24:39.220 --> 05:24:46.020
lovely jubb leaving we love to see it right you get to stay in my hand so does

05:24:46.020 --> 05:24:51.260
the 10 everything else honestly can be shoved out the window question mark

05:24:51.460 --> 05:24:59.060
nothing else is complimenting so I could probably go for she's gorilla in nearly

05:24:59.060 --> 05:25:03.740
one shot that yeah I can't believe them right so I'm gonna leave you on purpose

05:25:03.740 --> 05:25:08.300
everything else I'm just gonna go for some sort of high double cuz my cards are

05:25:08.300 --> 05:25:16.820
higher right you and wait maybe a single pair will do it shout out to all my

05:25:16.820 --> 05:25:27.860
pairs a single pair might do it a single pair did it absolutely use mercury

05:25:27.860 --> 05:25:35.420
holy crap that's two cars we got we got 16 bucks for that feels good man a

05:25:35.420 --> 05:25:44.300
straight absolutely yes please celestial planet and turret but we're

05:25:44.300 --> 05:25:53.220
gonna get both so it's not problem Saturn again oh feels freakin good man I

05:25:53.220 --> 05:26:01.740
think we may actually win this choose one of the turret cards yet strength 16

05:26:01.740 --> 05:26:07.140
bucks something into a gold card if you hold it you get money I don't really

05:26:07.140 --> 05:26:13.980
need money like that and a glass part no I think just money again and real increase

05:26:13.980 --> 05:26:17.060
the rank of a car

05:26:20.820 --> 05:26:31.260
do I do it that increase these not money money money money money money money

05:26:31.260 --> 05:26:38.500
strength strength on the twos okay strength on the twos let's do that we

05:26:38.500 --> 05:26:43.020
still get a multiplayer up for doing it so we're gonna re-roll no we're not

05:26:43.060 --> 05:26:48.420
we're too poor we're in 59 okay let's play it safe we're not gonna don't need

05:26:48.420 --> 05:26:52.060
to re-roll anything else how are you doing you're six multiplier right now

05:26:52.060 --> 05:26:55.860
so we're gonna try and get a few more twos and that's so cool on the eyes I

05:26:55.860 --> 05:26:59.460
don't know how well it translates on stream but that's so cool on the eyes

05:26:59.460 --> 05:27:05.540
that's exactly how it looks when you get like a card like that and really no I

05:27:05.540 --> 05:27:11.540
don't need to skip 52 lose a dollar per card that's fine I do not mind the tooth

05:27:11.580 --> 05:27:21.540
give me the tooth every round I'll take it right we could do two doubles again

05:27:21.540 --> 05:27:28.140
and get this guy leveled up again further and I think that's probably the

05:27:28.140 --> 05:27:31.500
wisest delayed gratification I don't know how much we're actually needing you

05:27:31.500 --> 05:27:36.740
hang about now I'm gonna do two dubs I know I should probably can go for

05:27:36.740 --> 05:27:39.900
straights because we're putting all our money into it but it looks pretty good

05:27:39.900 --> 05:27:45.700
to me oh the card didn't break

05:27:47.700 --> 05:27:56.300
um thank you I'll take it so now currently on 8 multi oh my god this is

05:27:56.300 --> 05:28:01.860
so satisfying so satisfying like oh yeah it's all coming together you only care

05:28:01.860 --> 05:28:05.140
about delayed gratification because it's a negative okay so it's not going

05:28:05.140 --> 05:28:15.220
anywhere but and we just have one pair hanging out you know that we have four

05:28:15.220 --> 05:28:22.180
rounds it's not really a big deal if we do like a lore thing like this on it the

05:28:22.180 --> 05:28:30.860
singular pair the singular pair one is whoa oh my god and we got fricking to

05:28:31.140 --> 05:28:38.580
yes use it now oh my god what are you enhance the steel card yes justice

05:28:38.580 --> 05:28:44.340
enhance one selected and I got sure knock yourself out one planet card to use

05:28:44.340 --> 05:28:48.660
come on give a Saturn baby oh close enough high card full house for the kind

05:28:48.660 --> 05:29:01.660
I never get for a full house is three and two and and the two will compliment

05:29:01.660 --> 05:29:06.540
pair I think airs earth is the best choice yes I agree with you sorry after I

05:29:06.540 --> 05:29:10.540
did the effect after I did the math in my head I agree with you that that is the

05:29:10.540 --> 05:29:15.580
best choice full house contains a pair isn't two and two better at this point

05:29:15.700 --> 05:29:21.620
and I let's see let's see what it actually claims I wish I would do the

05:29:21.620 --> 05:29:26.020
number math for me instead of giving me percentage like times I understand it

05:29:26.020 --> 05:29:35.140
can't do it but a singular pair is 800 two pairs of 600 okay I need to remember

05:29:35.140 --> 05:29:41.900
a singular pair truly is stronger but a straight is insanely strong four of a

05:29:41.900 --> 05:29:47.900
kind honestly isn't lagging behind too much nor is the full house so who's

05:29:47.900 --> 05:29:57.420
stronger a straight and then a pair not two pairs stop playing two pairs and we

05:29:57.420 --> 05:30:02.060
don't need a new Joker Joker card and we're gonna use these right

05:30:02.060 --> 05:30:07.380
eeps okay I lose a buck every time a player brown that's fine it doesn't

05:30:08.140 --> 05:30:12.900
convert three cards into diamonds that doesn't make a difference because we're

05:30:12.900 --> 05:30:20.460
not we're not doing suits or anything like that so it doesn't matter two pairs

05:30:20.460 --> 05:30:26.460
add a permanent multiplier ah yes I forgot about that part go for straight

05:30:26.460 --> 05:30:33.900
flush yeah two pairs just make a bunch of diamonds like a diamond in the sky right

05:30:33.940 --> 05:30:43.900
so never on 27 enhances something into a steel card sure let's just make you a

05:30:43.900 --> 05:30:51.420
steel car may steal the three sorry sorry alright steel three just say and

05:30:51.420 --> 05:30:59.340
then a chance to destroy a car sure I'm just gonna use that wine now we are now

05:30:59.380 --> 05:31:07.420
49 multi-pliers just getting juicy I'm here for it right just do a singular

05:31:07.420 --> 05:31:14.220
pair a singular pair is stronger than a double kind of not quite nine eight

05:31:14.220 --> 05:31:23.260
seven six five four three up nine eight seven six five four three oh no I want to

05:31:23.260 --> 05:31:39.780

05:34:44.600 --> 05:34:57.640
turned into a wild card whoa two pairs might be better now let's see two pairs

05:34:57.640 --> 05:35:06.840
120 times seven what number is that internet battle fail thank you for

05:35:06.840 --> 05:35:11.280

05:35:25.360 --> 05:35:32.040
about me so you're the eagle on my back because you have eagle eyes and level

05:35:32.040 --> 05:35:41.760
seven for the straight yep right let me do some math 100 times 8 is 800 100 times

05:35:41.760 --> 05:35:54.560
7 700 and then add 5 which makes it 840 so two pairs are now stronger close

05:35:54.560 --> 05:35:59.440
enough close enough I know that the two pairs are stronger it's close enough

05:35:59.480 --> 05:36:05.560
okay I don't know how to do math I'm just happy to be here I'm at the big

05:36:05.560 --> 05:36:10.200
number good she knows her math sometimes I have to do it in like segments I have

05:36:10.200 --> 05:36:13.720
to always do stuff times by five and then or times by ten and like trying to

05:36:13.720 --> 05:36:17.080
the other way around two pairs orders we don't even have to tell you anything

05:36:17.080 --> 05:36:22.120
you're already kicking nine seven six five oh I didn't even see that nine seven

05:36:22.160 --> 05:36:31.920
six five four level seven oh what are you gonna do baby show me show me what

05:36:31.920 --> 05:36:34.400
you're made of

05:36:34.400 --> 05:36:53.400
we're gonna win we're gonna win right what I need last no go away gold not

05:36:53.400 --> 05:37:05.800
really steal steal give us a steal on a five steal for sure yeah put on a five

05:37:05.800 --> 05:37:10.680
put on a nice little nice little five well I say hello four of a kind of a

05:37:10.680 --> 05:37:14.440
flush I'm just gonna buy these because I can I've got the money I've got the

05:37:14.440 --> 05:37:19.240
disposable income please use your disposable income don't need a joker card

05:37:19.400 --> 05:37:26.440
I didn't eat a reroll I said I need a reroll when small blind or big blind is

05:37:26.440 --> 05:37:46.400
like to gain one more give me it okay I am satisfied steal that ten we rule

05:37:46.400 --> 05:38:08.800
your jokers are perfect I don't want to skip the shop shit the odds of us getting

05:38:08.800 --> 05:38:14.840
straights are very high if we increase our hand size by three but if we increase

05:38:15.000 --> 05:38:26.160
if we skip the shop we might miss out on something big don't skip boss reroll what

05:38:26.160 --> 05:38:32.120
what what have can I tell what it's gonna reroll into it just is very large blind

05:38:32.120 --> 05:38:42.040
I assume there's no reroll in the final boss it's random it might make it worse

05:38:42.080 --> 05:38:50.480
like if it turns around and says you can't play whatever no we're making sorry

05:38:50.480 --> 05:39:00.600
we're making like 60,000 per hand I think I'm better playing and trying to get

05:39:00.600 --> 05:39:08.000
another multiplier I think play to beat three you need to hit straights like

05:39:08.080 --> 05:39:12.640
crazy reroll I am all then you have like six rerolls on the boss

05:39:20.160 --> 05:39:26.400
my brain is telling me play this go to the shop I can upgrade I can play these two and upgrade

05:39:26.400 --> 05:39:32.720
this by like 32 as well max procs thank you for coming a member during such a stressful time

05:39:33.360 --> 05:39:38.320
we're gonna do it I think I'd risk the boss reroll as it stands you have to hit

05:39:38.320 --> 05:39:44.320
straights every single and that's rough go with your boss normal number is much lower than

05:39:44.320 --> 05:40:01.760
that runes or streaks fuck

05:40:01.760 --> 05:40:24.640
cerulean bell means it's it's fine I won wait so does skip to have three more in my hand

05:40:24.640 --> 05:40:32.640
and then I can play these like as I get in because it'll add to the multiplier yeah you can do it or

05:40:32.640 --> 05:40:48.080
fuck oh fuck I'll show this right what's going on a wild card or do you do 10 queen okay I can't go

05:40:48.080 --> 05:40:56.240
that way queen has to be played so what wild card a king and just do a double single king

05:40:56.240 --> 05:41:02.480
oh wait no hold on two pair is stronger than a pair a flush is way stronger though

05:41:04.400 --> 05:41:11.760
you can also just discard it or discard it has to be played or discarded wait hold on let the

05:41:11.760 --> 05:41:17.760
reeflings think right let me just add a load of shit because this is going to add to our multiplier

05:41:17.760 --> 05:41:25.600
enhance two selected cards to multi cards whoa that's actually really big 10% messing around

05:41:27.360 --> 05:41:32.720
I can do well this turn it to a pair is not going to turn it to a pair

05:41:33.440 --> 05:41:42.480
king king queen six six do you want king let me activate the lover's card on this

05:41:43.040 --> 05:41:50.240
wait why do you know what enhance one selected card into a wild card why did that not work

05:41:51.600 --> 05:41:54.480
wait oh wait it was going to do it to the queen

05:41:55.440 --> 05:42:01.360
oh I mean it's going to put my multiplier up anyway

05:42:04.000 --> 05:42:06.720
yeah so that didn't really do anything that's fine

05:42:07.680 --> 05:42:14.880
your queen is forced to be selected empress will affect it okay we don't want that then so king king

05:42:15.440 --> 05:42:26.320
nine nine because I've got an odd number king king nine nine double will activate spear trousers

05:42:26.320 --> 05:42:35.120
odd will activate on the nine um nodders yeah yeah okay we've got agreements let's see what number

05:42:35.120 --> 05:42:40.880
are we gonna pull are we gonna win oh my god we might win

05:42:44.640 --> 05:42:51.120
six five wait six seven eight nine five

05:42:53.840 --> 05:43:00.480
and I can shove some mullies on it too while I'm at it why not why not why not I think we've won

05:43:01.360 --> 05:43:12.960
I think we've won nine eight seven six five I think we've done it we won virtual we actually did it

05:43:21.600 --> 05:43:29.520
you dealt that with that pretty well oh my god we did it it took us so long but we

05:43:29.520 --> 05:43:35.760
got there in the end told you you can do a hundred k in two hands wow

05:43:38.000 --> 05:43:42.080
okay when does the zero come on do I have time for another or do I need to get off

05:43:44.960 --> 05:43:48.240
oh my god wait endless mode we can keep going

05:43:48.640 --> 05:43:56.000
oh endless mode

05:43:58.640 --> 05:44:02.400
no stroney is there is live in twin okay well just keep mucking about uh

05:44:04.400 --> 05:44:08.320
well just keep mucking about we're not gonna like actually do anything like it's just gonna

05:44:08.320 --> 05:44:14.320
get harder one card slot available in the shop yeah it looks good to me that run took two hours

05:44:14.320 --> 05:44:18.800
most people quit before they get rich but you didn't quit no I didn't let's see the planet

05:44:21.600 --> 05:44:27.920
a double pair looks good to me urinus a bit of an urinus right so we've finished the game

05:44:29.600 --> 05:44:40.080
um we'll buy this because it'll upload it'll update our little guy everyone everyone's being

05:44:40.080 --> 05:44:46.880
so complimentary after defeating the boss blind you gain money I don't need that oh I'm going to

05:44:46.880 --> 05:44:52.080
keep the 10 on my persons right select three cards to turn into the moon and then our little

05:46:44.960 --> 05:46:47.920

05:47:16.800 --> 05:47:27.280
steal jack and the chariot all done where are we at 34 a straight flush is so rare I don't

05:47:27.280 --> 05:47:35.120
think it's happening with me increase hand size there's nothing we need from here choose one

05:47:35.120 --> 05:47:38.320
oh wait a playing card wait was it gonna is it special playing cards

05:47:38.400 --> 05:47:45.600
oh and you come and you come and you come right okay I'm actually kind of glad right we've got one

05:47:45.600 --> 05:47:53.760
reroll in us straight flush is more common now for you I think oh is it okay it's only two

05:47:53.760 --> 05:48:03.680
dollars as well right we're gonna do a reroll oh come on come on give it no right okay we're at 35

05:48:03.680 --> 05:48:15.600
though wheel of fortune let's go no what we use it three times technically right one more reroll

05:48:17.040 --> 05:48:22.560
what we got net chin one and two card to create a tarot when a booster pack is open

05:48:23.680 --> 05:48:29.280
I've tried it three times create a tarot card if the poker hand contains an ace or a straight

05:48:29.280 --> 05:48:33.040
brah we'd be tarotting out the wazoo but I don't know what I would give up for that

05:48:33.040 --> 05:48:37.280
things about I mean hold on

05:48:41.120 --> 05:48:47.840
hold on odd Todd in exchange for create a tarot card which is going to constantly bounce off

05:48:47.840 --> 05:48:56.320
of fortune tellers cheeks huh it's something to consider

05:49:01.200 --> 05:49:07.680
it's too late for polarity you think it's too late it's too late and an abstract one okay okay

05:49:08.640 --> 05:49:12.560
I do not have enough for another reroll I want to maximize that income okay it's too late I will

05:49:12.560 --> 05:49:17.760
okay thank you thank you thank you I am I am learning give us one dollar played hand I get 54

05:49:17.760 --> 05:49:26.640
bucks for skipping this wait that's worth it then but it skips the shop but it's 54 bucks

05:49:28.400 --> 05:49:30.960
playing a two pair sets money to zero

05:49:34.080 --> 05:49:36.320
all face cards are drawn face down

05:49:36.400 --> 05:49:41.920
yeah we definitely didn't oh no

05:49:45.360 --> 05:49:47.360
is that a mistake possibly

05:49:49.760 --> 05:49:52.720
54 bucks to skip but I need to buy stuff

05:49:53.440 --> 05:49:57.280
polarity is cool when you delete your middle cards and just get tarts over hand

05:49:58.960 --> 05:50:05.040
I think I'd do it for 54 bucks but we don't get access to the shop so if we mess up like this is it

05:50:05.600 --> 05:50:09.360
strongy you're endless every round we'll get higher and higher until you break

05:50:09.360 --> 05:50:16.800
until I break we're here to break the game if I get if I can mess around with 54 bucks so that's so big

05:50:20.080 --> 05:50:22.720
enough fuck it

05:50:24.560 --> 05:50:30.080
fuck it 103 have we even had 103 on our persons before

05:50:30.240 --> 05:50:35.200
right face down face cards are drawn down

05:50:37.680 --> 05:50:39.680
hmm

05:50:41.760 --> 05:50:45.680
10 9 10 9 8 7 6 5

05:50:51.200 --> 05:50:53.440
this will be a flush guaranteed but we will

05:50:54.240 --> 05:50:59.040
subs we will forfeit a tarot card if I do it

05:51:10.000 --> 05:51:15.200
not bad not bad oh this is getting a bit tricky though

05:51:17.200 --> 05:51:22.480
so these are all high so really I'm just going for a double up here high

05:51:24.000 --> 05:51:27.040
I don't really have a choice in the matter

05:51:29.200 --> 05:51:36.560
I don't really want to I want to keep you yeah this is the best I can do considering discard

05:51:36.560 --> 05:51:44.800
the face cards maybe dig for straights maybe just delete them it's just because we know they're high

05:51:44.800 --> 05:51:48.960
so there's the odds are there's likely a singular pair in here

05:51:49.360 --> 05:51:59.120
hmm but you're right though I could maybe get a straight low straight

05:52:02.240 --> 05:52:09.120
how many how many rounds I've already done one fourth of it but I have four hands left if I

05:52:09.120 --> 05:52:15.360
fuck this up it's just the likelihood of these being high or a pair is pretty decent

05:52:16.240 --> 05:52:24.480
and oh shit wait maybe not no wait you guys are right holy shit you're right

05:52:26.960 --> 05:52:30.000
10 9 8 7 6 5

05:52:31.920 --> 05:52:34.880
yeah and then there'll be a multiplier because of what's on my hand

05:52:35.840 --> 05:52:40.320
no that was the correct choice thank you guys thank you for letting me think a little bit there

05:52:40.320 --> 05:52:46.080
uh ace

05:52:50.720 --> 05:52:55.120
if there's not a queen in here we can't do a straight from here

05:52:57.440 --> 05:52:59.040
we might be able to do a straight

05:53:02.960 --> 05:53:08.960
or do we just play a singular ace what happens if it's a king

05:53:10.320 --> 05:53:15.120
we don't make it what happens if it's a queen then we make it

05:53:17.120 --> 05:53:18.800
it's a jack a queen or a king

05:53:21.280 --> 05:53:22.800
you still have three hands

05:53:25.920 --> 05:53:33.360
fuck it I'm here for the gamble we already won we already won so we can gamble like crazy

05:53:34.320 --> 05:53:40.080
we already won so we can do these silly silly actions that no one should do at home

05:53:40.880 --> 05:53:46.960
uh well a double four clear it I think it will yeah a double four will clear it no problem

05:53:49.760 --> 05:53:53.280
oh I fish my smart smart smart fish smart fish

05:53:55.680 --> 05:53:58.160
16 bucks the money's getting lesser

05:53:58.400 --> 05:54:01.760
oh don't mind if I do

05:54:04.560 --> 05:54:09.920
uh urinus also levels up what's this permanently add a discard for each one

05:54:10.480 --> 05:54:14.560
it's pretty good I'll add a permanent discount

05:54:15.360 --> 05:54:20.240
because that'll help out I've got a voucher unlocked even more I must be like steam sale

05:54:20.240 --> 05:54:25.680
tarot cards let's go I'm over 100 gold I'm just that good right

05:54:26.240 --> 05:54:33.680
planet glass stone planet planet no doubt four of a kind and a high card I mean

05:54:37.200 --> 05:54:42.960
I'm just level everything up high card a joker card I don't need so we're gonna do a re-roll

05:54:44.560 --> 05:54:50.320
a full house and a flush sure I'm quite happy there are only two dollars as well to buy like

05:54:50.400 --> 05:54:54.080
upgrade the base of everything so I honestly don't mind

05:54:55.280 --> 05:55:00.880
uh currently 18 joker well you are not gonna out oh you might outplay Todd

05:55:05.040 --> 05:55:09.520
uh odd Todd your time is starting to look up I'm not gonna lie

05:55:11.680 --> 05:55:20.240
50 chips 31 chips or 18 multiplier uh yeah I think it's time odd Todd

05:55:20.400 --> 05:55:26.320
you have done fantastic we are appreciative of your services but you simply have just been

05:55:26.320 --> 05:55:32.000
outplayed uh we will have you at the back I don't think it matters if you're at the back

05:55:32.000 --> 05:55:36.560
thank you odd Todd for your service abstract joker welcome in we've not had you before so please

05:55:36.560 --> 05:55:45.440
get ready to odd Todd is enabling your straights though have I just messed up put the pants on

05:55:45.440 --> 05:55:51.120
the back how do you know where to put it in the bank I hope I didn't miss mess up there right when

05:55:51.120 --> 05:56:01.600
we roll whoa why did you make that played face cards add odd Todd helps a lot rip run and before

05:56:01.600 --> 05:56:09.120
we lose this because I got rid of we odd Todd 80 chips if hand contains a flush not that good

05:56:09.200 --> 05:56:12.000
adds the number of times poker hands has been played

05:56:14.480 --> 05:56:20.080
adds the number of times poker hands has been played to this run to the multi

05:56:27.280 --> 05:56:31.200
that's fine a million

05:56:31.440 --> 05:56:35.280
a million

05:56:44.240 --> 05:56:48.640
endless is that yeah that's just I mean I knew we weren't gonna like infinitely win

05:56:50.160 --> 05:56:53.520
well re-roll sure I'll take a full swing

05:56:55.200 --> 05:57:00.720
Zach thank you for coming to member I appreciate it we are about to jump into the ASMR member

05:57:00.720 --> 05:57:05.280
stream slightly late for it don't worry about it guys and we are about to redirect into none other

05:57:05.280 --> 05:57:14.400
than a Zeridule who is doing ASMR so please do enjoy her uh to your full capacity straight flush

05:57:14.400 --> 05:57:20.080
I don't want to go straight flushed off me little all right we can do one more

05:57:24.240 --> 05:57:34.960
uh yes and yes to use well because we will utilize you okay next round

05:57:37.120 --> 05:57:41.920
let's go all right what do you do select two cards give out the left card into the right

05:57:42.880 --> 05:57:46.960
I would like to actually upgrade our doubles

05:57:54.160 --> 05:57:57.360
because we're not really doing it

05:58:02.640 --> 05:58:03.200
oh no

05:58:06.400 --> 05:58:09.680
that may have been a mistake I'm gonna be honest that may have been a mistake

05:58:10.560 --> 05:58:13.600
queen jack 10 no I don't have to flush at all

05:58:16.000 --> 05:58:24.240
ooh I might mess up there make another steal ooh I like that idea select two cards that convert

05:58:24.240 --> 05:58:36.880
the left card into the right one so two steals okay now I have to get riddles

05:58:39.760 --> 05:58:47.120
I couldn't theory if we're going for a flush get rid of the jewel jack because we can jump over him

05:58:47.840 --> 05:58:48.800
and vice versa

05:58:51.760 --> 05:58:57.520
uh we can jump over the jack at any point so he's not really necessarily needed

05:59:00.240 --> 05:59:04.720
or I could just get a steel jack you know your choice

05:59:04.720 --> 05:59:11.360
oh no this is oh no this can't be I'm doing shit

05:59:17.360 --> 05:59:22.720
wait am I a freaking idiot can I not jump allow straights to be made with gaps in one rank yeah

05:59:22.720 --> 05:59:29.120
so I can still do the jump ace marison yes I'm about to lose this round I'm not even joking and I

05:59:29.120 --> 05:59:34.640
I don't have any shred of hope I've completely balls this up and yeah I can still jump

05:59:36.000 --> 05:59:39.120
yeah I knew I could still jump I've got a shortcut and 10

05:59:44.480 --> 05:59:46.800
losing not good no not good at all but

05:59:49.120 --> 05:59:53.920
we'll survive ish I don't even know what to play

05:59:53.920 --> 06:00:00.320
hey the multiplier is so good but I have like nothing I can play

06:00:02.400 --> 06:00:05.680
king queen 10 and then nothing

06:00:07.760 --> 06:00:17.120
oh what do I do what do you recommend discard and fish for something better I'm gonna have to

06:00:17.840 --> 06:00:19.360
right queen I can discard

06:00:22.000 --> 06:00:26.800
I don't want to discard like these guys because they all give me a multiplier

06:00:28.240 --> 06:00:32.560
oh but I'm gonna have to wait that plays a pair apparently oh yeah it does

06:00:34.800 --> 06:00:40.560
I mean I only have four I can't throw it away

06:00:42.000 --> 06:00:44.880
well I can't throw away that's what I'm gonna do I need to go for a flush

06:00:44.880 --> 06:00:46.880
oh

06:00:51.760 --> 06:00:55.120
king queen jack 10 9 8 oh

06:00:58.240 --> 06:01:03.840
all right we're gonna have to just go for double vase 2 9

06:01:04.560 --> 06:01:04.960
I mean

06:01:09.440 --> 06:01:15.120
my luck is perishing guys I've used all my luck the game really said go redirect into

06:01:15.120 --> 06:01:21.040
a zero right now I mean it's not too bad you're right it's not too bad let's give a shot what's

06:01:21.040 --> 06:01:21.680
going on here

06:01:25.040 --> 06:01:26.000
no I've not got it

06:01:26.240 --> 06:01:35.760
I mean I can do a full house here but I've not got it

06:01:39.280 --> 06:01:45.040
oh I think it's ogre won't be a lose if you redirect or should I just redirect

06:01:45.040 --> 06:01:47.600
and end the stream and be like oh I won by the way wink wink

06:01:50.240 --> 06:01:52.960
this scaling and endless most is insane

06:01:53.920 --> 06:01:56.400
ah well we'll just play what we've got I know

06:01:59.920 --> 06:02:05.760
yeah now we've already lost the first endless holy crap right six five four three and I can't

06:02:05.760 --> 06:02:12.880
do anything wow that got like hard out in nowhere like so hard right we're just gonna

06:02:12.880 --> 06:02:18.800
we're not gonna win so there's no point in like trying to freaking go nuts with the math behind

06:02:18.800 --> 06:02:26.480
the game we don't have it right king jack 10 9 8 okay well don't have an 8 so we'll roll for an 8

06:02:31.760 --> 06:02:40.960
we'll roll for an 8 yeah king jack 10 9 8 that's the best we can do with both clubs

06:02:41.520 --> 06:02:49.440
no biggie we tried we tried our besties that wasn't bad that got insanely hard though like

06:02:49.440 --> 06:02:54.480
instantly insanely hard I am very interested in trying to win with all the other decks though

06:02:56.880 --> 06:03:02.880
pardon me sorry oh we unlocked a few things when I run without playing four of a kind oops

06:03:04.960 --> 06:03:09.920
well considering I didn't get it why would you give me that as a card when I run without playing a

06:03:09.920 --> 06:03:17.280
flush I mean that's really not that hard and then when I run copies the ability of the joker to the

06:03:17.280 --> 06:03:26.320
right oh that would be a very interesting card nebula deck unlocked when um start run with the

06:03:26.320 --> 06:03:35.120
telescope voucher and one consumable slot tell celestial pack always contain a planet card for

06:03:35.120 --> 06:03:43.840
your most played poker hand wow that's an interesting element redeem at least 10 voucher cards in one

06:03:43.840 --> 06:03:50.000
run all cards and packs are 50 off I thought that when I saw that I popped up on the side

06:03:50.000 --> 06:04:01.840
um planet cards in your consumable area give 1.5 multi for this one

06:04:03.920 --> 06:04:08.480
use a total of 25 planet cards from any pack I use 33 in that run flow

06:04:10.560 --> 06:04:18.160
use a total of 25 tarot cards from any arena spectral cards may appear in any of the oh so

06:04:18.160 --> 06:04:25.200
it's like bonus cards now I like that I love games that like level up and get easier or unlock more

06:04:25.200 --> 06:04:30.320
unique stuff as time goes on like that's why I really like binding of Isaac three times multi on

06:04:30.320 --> 06:04:41.920
final hand of a round play 200 hands well there it is balatro not to be diffused with more pro

06:04:42.880 --> 06:04:52.560
and okay okay let's make sure that Azura Dooley is online and then I will very quickly swap my

06:05:38.400 --> 06:05:41.600
she's not hmm

06:05:48.640 --> 06:05:53.280
when's the member stream right now when I redirect into Azura I'm literally gonna swap

06:05:53.280 --> 06:06:00.640
my microphones around and make sure I'm on my ASMR I mean if you really want to have that

06:06:00.640 --> 06:06:03.040

06:06:04.000 --> 06:06:06.560
yeah yeah you like that let's see it's my arena

06:06:08.720 --> 06:06:12.560
see it's not it's not it's not set up

one more run literally 90 for give her a few minutes yes I will wait until Azura goes live

06:06:21.440 --> 06:06:25.040
as far as I'm aware all is good and she's not canceling this room

06:06:31.440 --> 06:06:45.840
I mean she's online on the discord so

06:06:47.680 --> 06:06:53.760
wait what bit of battle did you enjoy the most since the experience is fresh what did I enjoy the most

06:06:53.760 --> 06:07:03.520
I think I enjoy discovering new cards and seeing how they all interact like that that new

06:07:03.520 --> 06:07:08.800
straight mechanic being like oh you can skip a straight I'm like what do you mean you can skip

06:07:08.800 --> 06:07:15.600
that's crazy like that was very fun to discover and you guys like telling me like what you think

06:07:15.600 --> 06:07:21.600
is the best play and then like I'll say like oh actually I felt like that Joker card you know

06:07:21.600 --> 06:07:26.560
we can do this we can do that and I quite like that I like the input I can do in this kind of game

06:07:26.560 --> 06:07:31.200
as well like I like when you guys can like tell me what to do and be like right we're in this

06:07:31.200 --> 06:07:35.520
together like it's us against the game you know it's not like it's not just me playing the game

06:07:35.520 --> 06:07:40.640
it's like all of us are like come on like as I said we would definitely be kicked out the casino

06:07:40.640 --> 06:07:44.560
by now because it's just me holding cards and then looking you all in the eyes like yeah

06:07:44.560 --> 06:07:49.040
does everyone agree and then everyone gives me a nod and then I play it like we'd be kicked out so

06:07:49.120 --> 06:07:50.160
quick so quick

06:07:57.200 --> 06:07:58.800
why did you give me a hundred for that

06:08:02.000 --> 06:08:06.640
ask ask terex why did you give me a hundred for that

06:08:08.640 --> 06:08:17.120
gen 3 confirmed steady on steady on two designs confirmed for gen two what thank you very much

06:08:17.120 --> 06:08:22.800
for that tip ask terex I appreciate it that's a big tip for literally well because I won in poker

06:08:22.800 --> 06:08:28.880
in virtual poker because it was fun well I'm glad you guys had fun that's so much fun I

06:08:28.880 --> 06:08:34.400
please do not be surprised if you see this game pop up again and I will most likely play it when

06:08:34.400 --> 06:08:41.840
my dad visits because I can you know do like a four hour stream of it and you know we can all

06:08:42.080 --> 06:08:49.440
hold my hand during the game thank you casino girl oh my god did you guys see that casino

06:08:49.440 --> 06:08:56.480
japanese vtuber um I'm gonna find the video and literally post it in chat I kid you not casino

06:08:56.480 --> 06:09:04.480
vtuber showcase look at this video and tell me this isn't that shit insane is this video was so

06:09:04.480 --> 06:09:11.040
impactful I have yet to forget about it um some of you might recognize it because they got recommended

06:09:11.360 --> 06:09:15.840
actually that reminds me nari wanted me to do a model showcase and she hasn't told me what she

06:09:15.840 --> 06:09:23.120
wants me to make of the models which I should have a wee look at that I put a link in chat right now

06:09:24.000 --> 06:09:32.240
haha four hours no way it's been six hours oh my god I was supposed to like be finished my eighth

06:09:32.560 --> 06:09:44.320
of ASMR by now um yes you might recognize that showcase because it did not leave my head

06:09:44.960 --> 06:09:51.200
we could see mama's brain expanding in real time yeah her hypnosis powers only grow stronger with

06:09:51.200 --> 06:09:55.040
time oh thank you phoenix for the tip I'm getting so big brains

06:09:55.440 --> 06:10:01.440
that can you tell in my voice when I'm thinking but yes if anyone's

06:10:01.440 --> 06:10:08.560
wanting a casino girl honestly I quite like moxie's design from what's her what's that

06:10:08.560 --> 06:10:12.880
franchise called oh my god we're claptrap and everything borderlands moxie borderlands

06:10:13.760 --> 06:10:23.680
I preferred moxie's borderlands what design was it moxie borderlands three design question mark

06:10:23.760 --> 06:10:25.120
was that the one I like the most

06:10:29.440 --> 06:10:33.040
I honestly wouldn't mind a cute hat on someone

06:10:35.040 --> 06:10:39.040
I'm down for a cute hat on someone I don't know who but someone

06:10:40.720 --> 06:10:45.200
my delay is bad enough I watched the whole video before she mentioned it in the video oh no

06:10:47.280 --> 06:10:52.240
I don't know why some of my streams have been on lowly uh on high normal latency and I've had to

06:10:52.240 --> 06:10:55.040
manually put it back to low latency so there isn't a delay

06:10:58.000 --> 06:11:04.160
right now I'm playing borderlands three I'm gonna uh for my birthday in October

06:11:05.040 --> 06:11:09.280
I'm gonna see if I can wrangle some v-tubers to play borderlands two campaign with me

06:11:10.000 --> 06:11:18.320
uh I'd like to do that for me birthday um problem is endurance streamers although saying that she

06:11:18.320 --> 06:11:23.040
be done an endurance stream and so has Azura um

06:11:26.720 --> 06:11:31.440
uh I might have made a new a new friend a new um

06:11:34.080 --> 06:11:37.920
what do you call it when it's a professional relationship like because we both work in the

06:11:37.920 --> 06:11:44.400
same job is that the terminology I may have made a new thingy it might be interesting possibly I

06:11:44.400 --> 06:11:50.800
could grab one chick from a v-tuber agency in different agencies and do a borderlands thing

06:11:50.800 --> 06:11:56.560
and it'll be like a four-way agency collab oh wow but you know only with people I vibe with because

06:11:56.560 --> 06:12:02.400
yeah uh business part yeah business relationship yeah that's pretty much my man and

06:12:04.160 --> 06:12:08.960
my main fact in the girls are endurance streaming we are so back literally I was so surprised Azura

06:12:08.960 --> 06:12:18.240
did like insane on a stardew valley apparently she has like thousands of hours in it and I'm like

06:12:20.240 --> 06:12:26.880
the game I have the most hours in is black ops one and then black ops two and then probably

06:12:26.880 --> 06:12:34.240
overwatch and then dead by daylight and then it just kind of gets scattered around the place from

06:12:34.800 --> 06:12:40.960
the 4k on stardew is she like a hundred percent of that stuff I think Isaac has most I think I

06:12:40.960 --> 06:12:47.840
uh I cleared like I think I'm just shy of 500 hours in Isaac how many hours in dead by daylight

06:12:47.840 --> 06:12:55.840
I was a very early player of dead by daylight I've probably got 1.5 thousand hours in dead by

06:12:55.840 --> 06:13:00.880
daylight I was an early dead by daylight player I am not familiar with anything do not ask me the

06:13:00.960 --> 06:13:08.320
question of anything uh in the recent updates I was gone a long time ago in that game um

06:13:10.160 --> 06:13:17.600
wait did I say the number right yeah I probably got like 4,000 in cards and then overwatch would be

06:13:17.600 --> 06:13:27.760
like 2,000 dead by daylight 1,000.5 like oh when I get into a game I get into a game like I'm only

06:13:27.760 --> 06:13:32.320
at 700 just watch vods in two times speed yeah that's how you keep up with my content I was like

06:13:32.320 --> 06:13:37.760
how am I supposed to keep up with your content if Azura has done a stardew stream into the 12 hour

06:13:37.760 --> 06:13:43.440
mark of the day she she would actually have you beaten off well if youtube would fix their

06:13:43.440 --> 06:13:52.480
vod issue then I'd be streaming a heck of a lot longer 4k and black ops one uh yeah most likely

06:13:52.480 --> 06:14:01.280
on that one alone um I was very isolated as a child and played black ops one all day long

06:14:01.920 --> 06:14:08.640
and I was having problems like going to school and all that had issues oh boo I'm gonna eat my

06:14:08.640 --> 06:14:13.680
my protein ball so my stomach isn't rumbling too much during the ASMR um

06:14:15.840 --> 06:14:20.960
2k and rims world ooh what's your guys' biggest game I have a next two weeks off of vacation

06:14:20.960 --> 06:14:23.920
might be able to catch up with Tony's vods by then good luck

06:14:28.400 --> 06:14:32.720
pretty strong you feel hot oh well we're in the good times now we flin don't worry about

06:14:34.080 --> 06:14:40.800
yeah I'm basically used to sit and play xbox all day because um my parents were like super

06:14:40.800 --> 06:14:49.040
understanding with the whole school situation um and having issues so I just kind of got left

06:14:49.440 --> 06:14:59.360
to my xbox and that's why I play a lot of xbox games dominions what's dominions five dominions

06:14:59.360 --> 06:15:04.640
five I haven't even heard of dominions one what kind of underground games are you guys playing

06:15:07.600 --> 06:15:10.400
mama and papa cuttles are best yeah

06:15:11.280 --> 06:15:15.120
mm-hmm oh this tastes awful I regret buying it

06:15:17.600 --> 06:15:24.160
this protein peanut butter ball is shit I cast mend but crack it's that bad

06:15:25.520 --> 06:15:29.040
probably dead by daylight with 3000 black ops mentioned one on five

06:15:31.760 --> 06:15:32.800
oh no that's not one with five

06:15:33.760 --> 06:15:35.600
do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

06:15:35.600 --> 06:15:39.280
not one 7k and destiny

06:15:40.880 --> 06:15:47.840
yeah damn did you play kod zombie no I was terrified of kod zombies I still am I find it terrifying

06:15:49.760 --> 06:15:58.560
I wish there was an end the reason why I thoroughly enjoyed college or a ghost alien mode is because

06:15:58.560 --> 06:16:03.660
there was an end you can you can either win the game mode or you can die to the

06:16:03.660 --> 06:16:08.360
aliens in the game mode which is why I adored it had an end games that are like

06:16:08.360 --> 06:16:12.720
infinite replayability but doesn't give you some sort of closure or ending I

06:16:12.720 --> 06:16:18.040
didn't like it so when like cod zombies keeps going that's not really for me

06:16:18.040 --> 06:16:23.600
although I'm sure there's a new zombie game out that's supposed to rival cod

06:16:23.600 --> 06:16:31.040
zombies kind of game mode completely forgotten the name of the game though

06:16:31.040 --> 06:16:36.360
20k hours in world of warcraft yeah damn your ERP and in Goldshire a little

06:16:36.360 --> 06:16:42.680
too much are you not I moved from game to game a lot 500 is probably on the

06:16:42.680 --> 06:16:51.760
highest an elite elite sniper oh I wouldn't mind playing warhammer 2 I want

06:16:51.760 --> 06:16:55.720
to see if there's any v-tubers that play warhammer 2 if it's the game I'm

06:16:55.720 --> 06:17:01.320
thinking about and I used to play the healer in it and heal and you give

06:17:01.320 --> 06:17:05.760
everyone heels and you go yeah that's me because it was like you use your voice

06:17:05.760 --> 06:17:15.720
