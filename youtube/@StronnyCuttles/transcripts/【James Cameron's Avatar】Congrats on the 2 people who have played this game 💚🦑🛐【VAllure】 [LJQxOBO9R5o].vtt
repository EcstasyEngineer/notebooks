WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.200
I was trying to speedrun up in the stream started and the game.

00:17.200 --> 00:23.680
This game crashes so heckin' easily and it literally just crashed there.

00:23.680 --> 00:24.680
Praying it works.

00:24.680 --> 00:25.680
Praying it works.

00:25.760 --> 00:26.760
Praying it works.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.880
But good morning, good evening, and good afternoon.

00:29.880 --> 00:30.880
Wee today.

00:30.880 --> 00:34.200
My screen is gone black so hopefully I'm still streaming.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.200
Oh my god.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.200
Right.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.200
This game breaks.

00:39.200 --> 00:42.160
Oh, I think it's about to break again.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.160
No way.

00:43.160 --> 00:46.160
Oh, this game breaks so easily.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.880
Oh, don't break, don't break.

00:48.880 --> 00:51.880
Oh, my screen's black again.

00:51.880 --> 00:52.880
What?

00:52.880 --> 00:58.080
Oh, this game breaks so easily.

00:58.080 --> 01:06.080
I think this is like 2007 maybe, but goodness me.

01:06.080 --> 01:08.760
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

01:08.760 --> 01:13.360
Wee are playing yet again, surprise surprise, another childhood game.

01:13.360 --> 01:14.360
Wait, what?

01:14.360 --> 01:15.360
Oh, it's 2009.

01:15.360 --> 01:20.200
It says James Cameron's Avatar the game 2009.

01:20.200 --> 01:30.400
So I played this game as a little sheriff and is there a girl that's white with black

01:30.400 --> 01:41.080
hair but, well, not blonde, I'm not, well, we just did that.

01:41.080 --> 01:46.040
Right, we're blonde with green eyes today, yippee.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.040
So this game.

01:47.040 --> 01:56.000
Okay, now it's got enter first name, squiddles, squiddly, I'm feeling a bit squiddly diddly

01:56.000 --> 01:59.720
the day but I bet you'd like that, wouldn't you?

01:59.720 --> 02:02.120
I had no idea they even released the game back then.

02:02.120 --> 02:12.680
Oh, this game is, I, right, I'll shush until the campaign part but they much to the campaign.

02:12.680 --> 02:14.720
Let me, I got slapped together.

02:14.720 --> 02:15.720
Let me tell you that much.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.320
I got slapped together.

02:21.320 --> 02:22.920
Welcome to Pandora.

02:23.920 --> 02:28.320
So, I am a big enthusiast of Avatar.

02:28.320 --> 02:31.720
I absolutely enjoy the movies to the highest of heavens.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.920
Oh my god, I've not played this in years.

02:40.920 --> 02:45.920
Oh, look at us.

02:45.920 --> 02:47.920
Sigourney Weaver.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.920
Big Sigourney Weaver, where'd you been?

02:57.920 --> 02:59.920
We've missed you, Sigourney.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.920
So I got three words for you.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.920
Don't screw up.

03:04.920 --> 03:05.920
Got it.

03:05.920 --> 03:10.920
I like, this is not stood up to the test of time, graphics wise.

03:10.920 --> 03:12.920
My neck be bending.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.920
My armpit textures are warped.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.920
Oh, AC and Snow Berries.

03:19.920 --> 03:20.920
Hi.

03:20.920 --> 03:22.920
How was your puzzle game, AC?

03:22.920 --> 03:23.920
I watched you in the bath.

03:23.920 --> 03:24.920
That's it.

03:24.920 --> 03:25.920
Oh, this is really weird.

03:25.920 --> 03:30.920
I was in the bath and I was like, I'm sure AC should be on right now.

03:30.920 --> 03:34.920
And I opened up the game and you were like, this is a child's game.

03:34.920 --> 03:35.920
How can I do this?

03:35.920 --> 03:37.920
I thought I could do this because I think someone said,

03:37.920 --> 03:39.920
why did you pick this game first?

03:42.920 --> 03:44.920
Snow Berry Raid.

03:47.920 --> 03:50.920
Yeah, there was like a big whale with loads of ropes all over it.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.920
And I was like, I've never seen this game in my life.

03:53.920 --> 03:54.920
I'm too dumb.

03:54.920 --> 03:55.920
Did you not finish it?

03:55.920 --> 03:56.920
Was it like a finished game?

03:56.920 --> 03:59.920
Or was it like one of those ones where it's like, ah, you just played for fun?

04:01.920 --> 04:02.920
Is Sheevee's fault?

04:02.920 --> 04:04.920
Sheevee, what did you do?

04:04.920 --> 04:06.920
She put the ropes in.

04:06.920 --> 04:07.920
Oh, that's very good.

04:07.920 --> 04:08.920
Oh, you finished it.

04:08.920 --> 04:09.920
Let's go.

04:09.920 --> 04:10.920
AC Smart.

04:10.920 --> 04:11.920
AC Smart.

04:11.920 --> 04:12.920
AC Smart.

04:12.920 --> 04:13.920
Hell's gate.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.920
Kendra.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.920
Congrats to your names, Kendra.

04:23.920 --> 04:26.920
Okay, so we are playing an RDA soldier.

04:26.920 --> 04:27.920
Boots on the ground.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.920
We are a signal specialist, okay?

04:30.920 --> 04:32.920
We've just arrived at Hell's Gate,

04:32.920 --> 04:40.920
which is where the humans have landed on the Navi's home planet, basically.

04:40.920 --> 04:48.920
And the way that we humans survive is by sectioning off areas of Pandora,

04:48.920 --> 04:52.920
because Pandora is so aggressive and dangerous.

04:56.920 --> 04:57.920
Wendy, yes.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.920
Shag the big blue ladies.

04:59.920 --> 05:00.920
Soon, soon.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.920
Hold on, hold on.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.920
You've never seen the movie before?

05:11.920 --> 05:12.920
Okay.

05:12.920 --> 05:13.920
Okay.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.920
How do you even summarize Avatar?

05:26.920 --> 05:32.920
This is a very old game, and it is not a fair, like, assessment of what this game's about.

05:32.920 --> 05:33.920
However.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.920
However, however, however.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.920
Too long didn't read, um,

05:37.920 --> 05:44.920
blow people good, humans bad, capitalism bad, being nice to the environment.

05:44.920 --> 05:45.920
Good!

05:45.920 --> 05:46.920
That's it.

05:46.920 --> 05:47.920
That's all you have to know.

05:47.920 --> 05:49.920
That's all you have to know.

05:49.920 --> 05:53.920
You have completely caught up to the Avatar franchise.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.920
Are you squeezing me right now?

05:55.920 --> 05:56.920
Ah!

05:56.920 --> 05:57.920
Bojenga, I'm thinking.

06:00.920 --> 06:01.920
Brian?

06:02.920 --> 06:07.920
Not me getting Brian back on the HUD.

06:07.920 --> 06:10.920
Thank you so much, Bojenga, for the 13, I appreciate it.

06:10.920 --> 06:14.920
I'm looking forward to this stream of this game that literally no one has played.

06:14.920 --> 06:21.920
I wish I could do a poll right now, but if I back out of this game, um, it crashes super easily.

06:21.920 --> 06:26.920
So basically, I don't even know if I'm going for a toilet break today.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.920
I'd like to open a set.

06:28.920 --> 06:34.920
Apparently the campaign mode is eight hours, but I don't believe it.

06:34.920 --> 06:35.920
Yes.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.920
We're at signal specialist.

06:37.920 --> 06:38.920
I didn't even know there was an avatar.

06:38.920 --> 06:43.920
Well, there's a new avatar game now, but we're playing the OG.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.920
Let me take a sip of my honey tea today.

06:45.920 --> 06:46.920
Aloha.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.920
Did you guys watch Mercy's ASMR?

06:51.920 --> 06:57.920
Congrats to Mercy Modis being the only member viewer to not get her VOD taken down

06:57.920 --> 07:01.920
and leave a warning on her channel for sexual misconduct.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.920
Give it up for Mercy!

07:05.920 --> 07:07.920
Oh my God.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.920
Let's go, Mercy.

07:13.920 --> 07:20.920
I am so nervous for my ASMR stream because I had planned something a bit special for it.

07:21.920 --> 07:28.920
And YouTube are dancing with all of us right now.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.920
Sorry, I'll get over the cutscenes first.

07:31.920 --> 07:34.920
We get to experience being in a navi body for the first time.

07:34.920 --> 07:42.920
If you haven't played, or don't know, you enter a booth which neural links you to a actual navi body.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.920
Don't look too much into it.

07:44.920 --> 07:47.920
It's pretty fantasy based and all that jazz, but yeah.

07:47.920 --> 07:51.920
We are now in navi, we have access to a navi body, but we are still RDA.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.920
RDA is the bad guys.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.920
Boo, boo, RDA.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.920
Navi, yay, navi, yay.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.920
But RDA, boo.

08:03.920 --> 08:04.920
Out you get.

08:04.920 --> 08:05.920
Oh my God, that neck!

08:05.920 --> 08:07.920
Oh, that's killing me.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.920
She looks like a giraffe.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.920
She's like, ooh, let me get over this bed real quick.

08:11.920 --> 08:15.920
You're actually quite good at this.

08:15.920 --> 08:19.920
With my fine tuning, you'll be zipping about with the best.

08:19.920 --> 08:23.920
So we have just been introduced to our avatar body.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.920
Navi body.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.920
RDA mission complete.

08:27.920 --> 08:31.920
So yes, this is a much older game.

08:31.920 --> 08:35.920
You need to find Kensington and help him bring the side gates online.

08:35.920 --> 08:37.920
They just shut down.

08:37.920 --> 08:39.920
So we are about to...

08:39.920 --> 08:41.920
He's ready for you.

08:41.920 --> 08:43.920
He's eager to meet you.

08:43.920 --> 08:45.920
He usually doesn't interact with the avatars.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.920
Hate them.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.920
Folks got a thing against avatars.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.920
Like I said, there's more going on here than you know.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.920
It's good for its age, honestly.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.920
So the newest avatar, I haven't had an...

08:55.920 --> 08:57.920
Oh, Brian!

08:57.920 --> 08:59.920
I'm here to be neural linked with a reefling.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.920
This should cover the copay.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.920
Barrow, thank you for the 20.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.920
Would you guys neural link with me?

09:05.920 --> 09:07.920
Like if you could go to bed, like you see everything from AppioV.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.920
Would that still be in control at that point?

09:09.920 --> 09:11.920
Or would you want to control me?

09:11.920 --> 09:13.920
Or would you want me to control you?

09:19.920 --> 09:21.920
Do you really need to ask?

09:21.920 --> 09:23.920
I don't know if you want to see my appeal with me.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.920
You just like dine and be really disappointed that I don't have big boobs.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.920
Does the nicotine patch interfere with the process?

09:27.920 --> 09:29.920
Nah, you can leave it on.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.920
If anything, it makes it better when you're in control.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.920
I don't know.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.920
Nah, you can leave it on.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.920
If anything, it makes it better when you're in control.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.920
So this is the reason

09:39.920 --> 09:41.920
we are

09:41.920 --> 09:43.920
in Pandora,

09:43.920 --> 09:45.920
the world.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.920
You see those purple things underneath?

09:47.920 --> 09:49.920
Those are the resources

09:49.920 --> 09:51.920
we mine from this planet

09:51.920 --> 09:53.920
for capitalism back on Earth.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.920
It is crazy, honestly.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.920
I get to pray.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.920
Hard to believe you're finally here.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.920
Seems like a lifetime ago.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.920
Reporting for duty, sir.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.920
Drop the formality.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.920
Atonement.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.920
Someone in the avatar program is feeding

10:09.920 --> 10:11.920
classified RDA info to the local

10:11.920 --> 10:13.920
Navi squad.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.920
We've got to have a full scale

10:15.920 --> 10:17.920
made of uprising on our hands.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.920
The resources be purple.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.920
You'll see soon enough.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.920
A big boat better than Big Bois.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.920
Your skills as a towbreaker are highly

10:25.920 --> 10:27.920
underrated on this planet.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.920
We're here to get the blue oil.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.920
Someone say oil.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.920
Oh, they can't use

10:37.920 --> 10:39.920
By the dawn

10:39.920 --> 10:41.920
sparely

10:41.920 --> 10:43.920
Did I tell you

10:43.920 --> 10:45.920
in a voice chat

10:45.920 --> 10:47.920
I sung that but I only know the first two lines

10:47.920 --> 10:49.920
and then

10:49.920 --> 10:51.920
freaking Sheevee and Azura

10:51.920 --> 10:53.920
burst out into singing

10:53.920 --> 10:55.920
the actual thing and I was like

10:55.920 --> 10:57.920
oh my god this is really

10:57.920 --> 10:59.920
I was getting

10:59.920 --> 11:01.920
by the dawn

11:01.920 --> 11:03.920
early

11:03.920 --> 11:05.920
lay

11:05.920 --> 11:07.920
I once

11:07.920 --> 11:09.920
I don't know the words at all

11:09.920 --> 11:11.920
and I don't know why it's so hard.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.920
Why does it go high?

11:13.920 --> 11:15.920
Did you guys see my Twitter post about

11:15.920 --> 11:17.920
how much I got scammed on American sweets?

11:17.920 --> 11:19.920
Hello.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.920
So these are just basic transporters

11:21.920 --> 11:23.920
but as you can see this is the whole map

11:23.920 --> 11:25.920
of Pandora. We will unlock a few more locations soon

11:25.920 --> 11:27.920
but there's not really much detail to it.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.920
We're currently at Hell's Gate.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.920
We are going to get flown to Blue Lagoon

11:31.920 --> 11:33.920
but as you can see this earth

11:33.920 --> 11:35.920
is healthy. There's lots of blues and greens

11:35.920 --> 11:37.920
and all that.

11:37.920 --> 11:39.920
It's a nice healthy earth.

11:39.920 --> 11:41.920
Blue Lagoon.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.920
Open the game, oh that's just a

11:43.920 --> 11:45.920
information thing. I thought I was going to explain

11:45.920 --> 11:47.920
what Blue Lagoon is.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.920
Blue Lagoon is where a lot of the navi

11:49.920 --> 11:51.920
that are controlled by the RDA side hangout

11:51.920 --> 11:53.920
and a few of the tribes are tolerant

11:53.920 --> 11:55.920
to our behaviors.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.920
Our human activities.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.920
You want to see the planet?

11:59.920 --> 12:01.920
This is the safest place to do it.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.920
Yes.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.920
So this is tutorial island essentially.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.920
I thought this game was a fever dream.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.920
It's real.

12:09.920 --> 12:11.920
Hi Stormy. I remember playing this game as a kid.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.920
Congrats you're one of the two people

12:13.920 --> 12:15.920
who have played this game.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.920
That's watching right now.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.920
A very very underground game.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.920
I'll tell you a very fun factoid

12:21.920 --> 12:23.920
about this game.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.920
So obviously I was an Xbox kid.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.920
If you were able to obtain a copy

12:27.920 --> 12:29.920
of the

12:29.920 --> 12:31.920
special

12:31.920 --> 12:33.920
Oh

12:33.920 --> 12:35.920
I

12:35.920 --> 12:37.920
loved that little

12:37.920 --> 12:39.920
animation.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.920
This was probably before

12:41.920 --> 12:43.920
motion capture was even a thing

12:43.920 --> 12:45.920
because what the heck was that?

12:45.920 --> 12:47.920
Our encounter

12:47.920 --> 12:49.920
with Pandora's

12:49.920 --> 12:51.920
wildlife. These are

12:51.920 --> 12:53.920
viper wolves.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.920
They're terrifying.

12:55.920 --> 12:57.920
But their designs

12:57.920 --> 12:59.920
are so good.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.920
The animal designs are freaking amazing.

13:01.920 --> 13:03.920
I am needing to

13:03.920 --> 13:05.920
remember

13:05.920 --> 13:07.920
to analyze.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.920
We have freaking special abilities

13:09.920 --> 13:11.920
for some reason.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.920
I can go and visit and shit

13:13.920 --> 13:15.920
but you can level up and progress

13:15.920 --> 13:17.920
and make these abilities way stronger

13:17.920 --> 13:19.920
and literally it's pretty insane.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.920
The game's got loads of things going for it.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.920
So right now we're just

13:23.920 --> 13:25.920
defending the perimeter

13:25.920 --> 13:27.920
from...

13:27.920 --> 13:29.920
What's the way the game isn't too loud?

13:29.920 --> 13:31.920
I cannot adjust the volume without breaking it.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.920
We're just defending the perimeter from

13:33.920 --> 13:35.920
almost a shot or one guy there.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.920
Is it working?

13:37.920 --> 13:39.920
Okay, there we go.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.920
You do get XP.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.920
There is a level up system in this game as well.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.920
I am so bad at aiming. Holy crap.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.920
It's hard with a child.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.920
Child me is like so much

13:49.920 --> 13:51.920
better gamer.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.920
When it comes to this stuff honestly

13:53.920 --> 13:55.920
Lollipop

13:55.920 --> 13:57.920
model confirms

13:57.920 --> 13:59.920
we're doing some rewards

13:59.920 --> 14:01.920
because actually why am I so much better

14:01.920 --> 14:03.920
at this game? I know they spawn over

14:03.920 --> 14:05.920
there a lot.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.920
Okay, objective complete.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.920
Love to see you play the game

14:09.920 --> 14:11.920
but I will be very happy for

14:11.920 --> 14:13.920
every Navi I see die.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.920
You're joking.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.920
You picked the RDA?

14:17.920 --> 14:19.920
Who are you?

14:19.920 --> 14:21.920
Iron Reaper?

14:21.920 --> 14:23.920
You picked the freaking...

14:23.920 --> 14:25.920
Why would you prick?

14:25.920 --> 14:27.920
I literally just had a Freudian slip and

14:27.920 --> 14:29.920
called you a prick there.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.920
Why would you pick?

14:31.920 --> 14:33.920
Not the Navi.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.920
Thank you for the 50. That's insane.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.920
Thank you for the 50.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.920
But you're wrong.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.920
RDA supremacy.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.920
Reflangs?

14:43.920 --> 14:45.920
We're here for...

14:45.920 --> 14:47.920
We're here for nature

14:47.920 --> 14:49.920
and to be nice to wildlings.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.920
I'm literally a cuttlefish.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.920
Are you saying...

14:53.920 --> 14:55.920
Oh is this Halo Controls?

14:55.920 --> 14:57.920
No, kind of.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.920
You can be attacked when you go out

14:59.920 --> 15:01.920
but I will say one thing

15:01.920 --> 15:03.920
the motion sickness. Merci.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.920
If you're lurking do not watch this.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.920
This motion sickness on the vehicles

15:07.920 --> 15:09.920
is insane. Oh we're doing hit and runs.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.920
Oh right, I missed that but whatever.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.920
I can't remember much.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.920
There is going to be...

15:15.920 --> 15:17.920
This guy should...

15:17.920 --> 15:19.920
There is like aim assist in this game

15:19.920 --> 15:21.920
so if you're bad at video games

15:21.920 --> 15:23.920
please don't worry if you ever

15:23.920 --> 15:25.920
think you might want to

15:25.920 --> 15:27.920
give this game a shot.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.920
This game is giving

15:29.920 --> 15:31.920
commands for keyboard but that's

15:31.920 --> 15:33.920
because...

15:33.920 --> 15:35.920
What?

15:35.920 --> 15:37.920
Wait, wait, wait, four pounds!

15:37.920 --> 15:39.920
Wait, where the heck did it go?

15:41.920 --> 15:43.920
I'm fighting.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.920
Oh, we're going to stick a match to go down.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.920
Oh come on!

15:47.920 --> 15:49.920
You can tell Peel as well which is really good in this game.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.920
This game is definitely for people who

15:51.920 --> 15:53.920
are not very...

15:53.920 --> 15:55.920
I would say if you're new to gaming

15:55.920 --> 15:57.920
the game is very friendly to you.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.920
I say that as I literally am forgetting

15:59.920 --> 16:01.920
all the spawn locations of the enemies right now.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.920
These are...

16:03.920 --> 16:05.920
Viper Wolves.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.920
Um...

16:07.920 --> 16:09.920
Literally waiting till this game

16:09.920 --> 16:11.920
gets so beautiful. I wish...

16:11.920 --> 16:13.920
I don't know what the new avatar game is like

16:13.920 --> 16:15.920
genuinely about. I heard those growls.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.920
I heard that!

16:17.920 --> 16:19.920
I have gamer sense, okay?

16:19.920 --> 16:21.920
Oh, there's another one.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.920
Jeez!

16:23.920 --> 16:25.920
My trigger just got stuck there.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.920
Um...

16:27.920 --> 16:29.920
Are you squidding me right now?

16:29.920 --> 16:31.920
What?

16:35.920 --> 16:37.920
No!

16:37.920 --> 16:39.920
The Navi are the good guys!

16:39.920 --> 16:41.920
Slice Saber?

16:41.920 --> 16:43.920
How dare you?

16:43.920 --> 16:45.920
Thank you for the tip.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.920
But the Navi are the good guys!

16:47.920 --> 16:49.920
We're supposed to protect humanity, okay?

16:51.920 --> 16:53.920
Right, so we're currently saving

16:53.920 --> 16:55.920
the current signal thing.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.920
I don't know.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.920
Tutorial...

16:59.920 --> 17:01.920
We are doing tutorial, but I'm just spamming through it

17:01.920 --> 17:03.920
because I want to be Navi.

17:03.920 --> 17:05.920
Dogs.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.920
Everyone's literally so beefed up

17:09.920 --> 17:11.920
in this game for no reason.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.920
Wait, you say Navi's good guys

17:13.920 --> 17:15.920
protect humanity.

17:15.920 --> 17:17.920
The Navi are the big blue ones.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.920
The big blue ones protect

17:19.920 --> 17:21.920
nature. We protect nature, okay?

17:25.920 --> 17:27.920
We...

17:27.920 --> 17:29.920
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, you ready for this?

17:29.920 --> 17:31.920
We...

17:31.920 --> 17:33.920
We protect nature, little reform.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.920
We protect nature, little reform.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.920
You want to be a good boy for humanity.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.920
You want to recycle

17:39.920 --> 17:41.920
where physically possible.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.920
But we understand...

17:43.920 --> 17:45.920
Oh wait.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.920
If the RDA are the bad guys,

17:47.920 --> 17:49.920
then why are their mechs so cool?

17:49.920 --> 17:51.920
Checkmate, tree huggers.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.920
Uh...

17:53.920 --> 17:55.920
Well, I'm going to show you

17:55.920 --> 17:57.920
me absolutely wrecking and fricking decking

17:57.920 --> 17:59.920
those mechs.

17:59.920 --> 18:01.920
There's no way you guys are genuinely

18:01.920 --> 18:03.920
picking the human side.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.920
Doomsday, Dan.

18:05.920 --> 18:07.920
You're getting a spank, but thanks for the tip.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.920
And Beijing got again.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.920
No!

18:11.920 --> 18:13.920
You're wrong. You have to be nice.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.920
If I have to hit me...

18:15.920 --> 18:17.920
Tree huggers!

18:17.920 --> 18:19.920
If that makes me a tree hugger, then guess what?

18:19.920 --> 18:21.920
I'll proudly identify myself as a tree humper.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.920
Oh, I just got her. Oh, I'm getting...

18:23.920 --> 18:25.920
I'm getting... I'm getting ganged up on.

18:25.920 --> 18:27.920
I'm getting ganged up on.

18:27.920 --> 18:29.920
Well, literally, the bark is peeling off

18:29.920 --> 18:31.920
from how hard I'm humping the wildlife

18:31.920 --> 18:33.920
right now, okay?

18:33.920 --> 18:35.920
Because...

18:35.920 --> 18:37.920
I'm not...

18:37.920 --> 18:39.920
This is so much easier as a child.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.920
Hello, child, me. Can you just, like,

18:41.920 --> 18:43.920
I don't know, possess my body right now?

18:43.920 --> 18:45.920
Because why am I getting wrecked and decked?

18:45.920 --> 18:47.920
Glory to the hypno, toad.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.920
Protect the navi and the sea stuff.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.920
Oh, for goodness sake!

18:51.920 --> 18:53.920
I'm getting wrecked! I'm getting wrecked!

18:53.920 --> 18:55.920
I'm getting me right now.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.920
Only simp for cuttlefish.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.920
Human supremacy.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.920
Down with the blues freaks.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.920
Would you get...

19:03.920 --> 19:05.920
Tim... What the heck? Tim Shuttle?

19:05.920 --> 19:07.920
Tim Shuttle?

19:07.920 --> 19:09.920
Your name is literally cuttlefish, a little Shuttlefish.

19:09.920 --> 19:11.920
Glory to the hypno, toad.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.920
Protect the navi and the sea stuff.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.920
See, Tim knows exactly what he's on about.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.920
Thank you, Tim! At least some of us have sent...

19:17.920 --> 19:19.920
Are you squidding me right now?

19:19.920 --> 19:21.920
Sorry, Strone, but I'll never trust a species

19:21.920 --> 19:23.920
whose idea of taming animals

19:23.920 --> 19:25.920
is to penetrate them with weird tentacles.

19:25.920 --> 19:27.920
Right, you've got me there.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.920
You've got me a wee bit there. Hold on, hold on.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.920
But give them a chance, give them a chance.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.920
Thank you, Otter Von Biscuit.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.920
Damn right you only simp for cuttlefish.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.920
We the best out here.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.920
Oh wait, I just realized,

19:39.920 --> 19:41.920
I think I'm supposed to drive the car in here.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.920
Oh, I think I'm about to get attacked.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.920
Or maybe those guys are protecting me.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.920
I'm not sure.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.920
There we go.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.920
Run now, the logist!

19:51.920 --> 19:53.920
Oh!

19:53.920 --> 19:55.920
See, you have level up system.

19:59.920 --> 20:01.920
I have terrible news for you.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.920
If you want to do survival of the fittest,

20:03.920 --> 20:05.920
no weapons.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.920
Absolutely. Goodness.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.920
Is this...?

20:09.920 --> 20:11.920
Take this!

20:11.920 --> 20:13.920
Fort Bomb.

20:13.920 --> 20:15.920
Thank you very much.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.920
Uh...

20:17.920 --> 20:19.920
Tharja IBW.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.920
What a unique...

20:21.920 --> 20:23.920
Thank you, thank you very much for the tip.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.920
Sorry, Strony, but I'll never trust a species at...

20:25.920 --> 20:27.920
Look.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.920
All I'm seeing is give tentacles a chance.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.920
I might be getting a little tentacle edition here and there, you know?

20:31.920 --> 20:33.920
Am I going the wrong way?

20:33.920 --> 20:35.920
It looks like I'm going the wrong way on the map.

20:35.920 --> 20:37.920
I've not been here before.

20:37.920 --> 20:39.920
Oh my goodness, the camera angle.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.920
Look, the game aged all right.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.920
I'm not going to say it aged well.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.920
Wait, is there a little path back here?

20:45.920 --> 20:47.920
It's a lie.

20:47.920 --> 20:51.920
Oh my goodness, this camera angle is horrific.

20:51.920 --> 20:53.920
I'm getting sick myself.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.920
Let me in.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.920
Let me in.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.920
I'm human. What are you doing?

20:59.920 --> 21:01.920
Okay, I actually have to go backwards.

21:01.920 --> 21:03.920
Thank you, not Alessandro as well.

21:03.920 --> 21:05.920
Rules of nature, survival pit.

21:05.920 --> 21:09.920
Oh my god, lady driver moment.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.920
Please, camera angle.

21:11.920 --> 21:13.920
Please, jeez, Louise.

21:13.920 --> 21:15.920
Let me work here.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.920
My goodness, this is awful.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.920
Why is the camera dead?

21:19.920 --> 21:21.920
Oh my god.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.920
This is horrific.

21:23.920 --> 21:25.920
Are you kidding me right now?

21:25.920 --> 21:27.920
Oh, thank god I don't get emotional things in the video game.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.920
Do not expect the message to work this time long.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.920
Anyways, have fun, strongy, and rejoice.

21:31.920 --> 21:33.920
Brian's back.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.920
So when you tip, you can actually, like,

21:35.920 --> 21:37.920
I can hear it and you can hear it.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.920
Thank you again for the another tip, Alessandro.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.920
Bitches, when you tip, you will never be read out.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.920
Oh my god.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.920
That camera angle is horrific.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.920
Please, do not ever make me drive one of those again.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.920
Thank you.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.920
Oh, goodness me.

21:51.920 --> 21:53.920
Right, what is the heck is this?

21:53.920 --> 21:55.920
I've forgotten.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.920
Oh, it's a teleport pod.

21:57.920 --> 21:59.920
Okay, you can teleport between the different regions.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.920
So this is all the Blue Lagoon area.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.920
As you can see, there's one, two, three, four, five.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.920
Why are the teleport points all at the bottom

22:05.920 --> 22:07.920
and only one at the top?

22:07.920 --> 22:09.920
I'll see how it is.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.920
Make a mirror walk everywhere.

22:11.920 --> 22:13.920
Okay, a little sip of my tea.

22:13.920 --> 22:15.920
Have you played it?

22:15.920 --> 22:17.920
Are you sure you've played this before?

22:17.920 --> 22:19.920
The accusations?

22:19.920 --> 22:21.920
I'm not beating the accusations.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.920
Right, I'm going to finish my tea before it gets too cold.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.920
I'm delicious.

22:27.920 --> 22:29.920
I like the reverb effect on the burp.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.920
I mean, I don't want to ruin anything,

22:31.920 --> 22:33.920
but that definitely may or may not happen

22:33.920 --> 22:35.920
in a certain ASMR stream.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.920
I like freakin' changed the title of the ASMR stream

22:37.920 --> 22:39.920
because I don't know what is going on.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.920
Everyone's getting warnings left, right, and center.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.920
Now, don't get me wrong.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.920
Any jumping up and doing on the bed,

22:45.920 --> 22:47.920
it's quite humorous, okay?

22:47.920 --> 22:49.920
And I don't know, did she be actually doing

22:49.920 --> 22:51.920
anything that was that wrong?

22:51.920 --> 22:53.920
Azura, now, the only reason I will say

22:53.920 --> 22:55.920
Azura had received that warning

22:55.920 --> 22:57.920
was on the pure basis.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.920
Her voice is just like honey.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.920
Her voice is

23:01.920 --> 23:03.920
the sun embracing you

23:03.920 --> 23:05.920
after a few days of rain.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.920
Her voice is like honey.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.920
Her voice is like

23:09.920 --> 23:11.920
that hug you have needed for a

23:11.920 --> 23:13.920
years, and you just

23:13.920 --> 23:15.920
let it all out, and you

23:15.920 --> 23:17.920
like, her...

23:17.920 --> 23:19.920
However,

23:19.920 --> 23:21.920
the other side of the coin for

23:21.920 --> 23:23.920
Azura's voice is

23:23.920 --> 23:25.920
it won't go down.

23:25.920 --> 23:27.920
It can't stay down.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.920
There's no such thing as a refractory

23:29.920 --> 23:31.920
period to her when you listen

23:31.920 --> 23:33.920
to her voice. Maybe you'll get 10 minutes

23:33.920 --> 23:35.920
of peace at max, you know what I'm saying?

23:35.920 --> 23:37.920
So, I can't

23:37.920 --> 23:39.920
get why she got a warning. I don't think

23:39.920 --> 23:41.920
she got a warning because she was

23:41.920 --> 23:43.920
wise enough to private it.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.920
I don't know, I don't know if she did delete that.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.920
Did she do ear licking?

23:49.920 --> 23:51.920
Goodness me, can't even do it with ear licking.

23:51.920 --> 23:53.920
I don't know what's going on, because people

23:53.920 --> 23:55.920
that show their face are still uploading

23:55.920 --> 23:57.920
all fine and dandy, so I think

23:57.920 --> 23:59.920
there might be a H-E-N

23:59.920 --> 24:01.920
update to the tie.

24:01.920 --> 24:03.920
Possibly

24:03.920 --> 24:05.920
pop stealth policy. Oh god, not the camera

24:05.920 --> 24:07.920
angle again.

24:07.920 --> 24:09.920
I'm currently driving with one hand, so this

24:09.920 --> 24:11.920
is going to go absolutely awful.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.920
But look how big Pandora is, it's fantastic.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.920
One hand steering whilst I

24:17.920 --> 24:19.920
drink my tea.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.920
I'm like a real contractor, honestly.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.920
Look, I'm just here to do the contract work.

24:25.920 --> 24:27.920
I'm not here to do anything special.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.920
I get paid on the day.

24:29.920 --> 24:31.920
Okay,

24:31.920 --> 24:33.920
driving isn't actually that bad, right?

24:33.920 --> 24:35.920
Let's speed up, let's go.

24:35.920 --> 24:37.920
Let's see if two handed, I'm even worse,

24:37.920 --> 24:39.920
probably.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.920
Oh, I'm hitting, I'm hitting the land.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.920
I'm doing the Titanic.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.920
Titanic momentum.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.920
Yes, thank you.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.920
Thank you for the tip, Kitsune.

24:57.920 --> 24:59.920
Literally,

24:59.920 --> 25:01.920
I don't think I've really

25:01.920 --> 25:03.920
met anyone that's

25:03.920 --> 25:05.920
heard about this heckin' game.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.920
But I'm glad that a few of you actually have played it.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.920
Okay, I'm just on the walking teleport stations

25:09.920 --> 25:11.920
when I do that.

25:11.920 --> 25:13.920
Hi, hi everyone joining.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.920
We're playing Avatar, James Cameron's

25:15.920 --> 25:17.920
Avatar. Some people thought

25:17.920 --> 25:19.920
it was Avatar

25:19.920 --> 25:21.920
the last airbender related.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.920
No, no, no, no, no.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.920
Not at all. Although, I think

25:25.920 --> 25:27.920
we might be doing a watch along with that.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.920
If you're into watch-alongs, please do

25:29.920 --> 25:31.920
think about supporting your local neighborhood

25:31.920 --> 25:33.920
little sister, because she may be

25:33.920 --> 25:35.920
doing a watch along with that already.

25:35.920 --> 25:37.920
I'm going to take a little sipping tune of my cola.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.920
I need to hydrate.

25:39.920 --> 25:41.920
Now I get to ramble about

25:41.920 --> 25:43.920
all the work I did yesterday.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.920
Okay, so the update is

25:45.920 --> 25:47.920
Are you squidding me right now?

25:47.920 --> 25:49.920
Unless.

25:49.920 --> 25:51.920
Brian!

25:55.920 --> 25:57.920
Honestly though,

25:57.920 --> 25:59.920
thank you for the tip.

25:59.920 --> 26:01.920
Tarja.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.920
I feel like that's not how you're supposed to pronounce it.

26:03.920 --> 26:05.920
Or are you Swedish and it's

26:05.920 --> 26:07.920
Tarja?

26:07.920 --> 26:09.920
A little bit of a Swedish

26:09.920 --> 26:11.920
moment.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.920
Look, it's that guy we saved

26:13.920 --> 26:15.920
in that cave only a few minutes

26:15.920 --> 26:17.920
ago.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.920
Viper Wolves.

26:19.920 --> 26:21.920
Viper Wolves.

26:25.920 --> 26:27.920
What kind of cola?

26:27.920 --> 26:29.920
Just cola cola.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.920
Is it called Coke Zero

26:31.920 --> 26:33.920
when it's got the no sugar?

26:33.920 --> 26:35.920
I finally went no sugar on the cola.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.920
Aspartame.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.920
I can finally tolerate aspartame.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.920
It is that thing that is in the drinks

26:41.920 --> 26:43.920
to make it sugar free.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.920
But I was like, I don't mind having

26:45.920 --> 26:47.920
a big badonk-a-donk, but I don't want

26:47.920 --> 26:49.920
it to get too big, so I'm now

26:49.920 --> 26:51.920
drinking aspartame, which apparently

26:51.920 --> 26:53.920
gives rats cancer.

26:53.920 --> 26:55.920
So it's not looking good for us mammals.

26:55.920 --> 26:57.920
But hey, oh, you gotta die something

26:57.920 --> 26:59.920
and, you know, I'm not going out

26:59.920 --> 27:01.920
without enjoying myself.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.920
That's all I'm saying on them.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.920
There are Viper Wolves here, so please excuse

27:05.920 --> 27:07.920
the combat.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.920
Boom.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.920
Now, you can just kind of do this.

27:11.920 --> 27:13.920
But it does bring

27:13.920 --> 27:15.920
you out of fricking invisibility.

27:15.920 --> 27:17.920
Get in the boat! Get in the boat! Drive away!

27:17.920 --> 27:19.920
Drive away!

27:19.920 --> 27:21.920
Yeah, see, they get scared of my little

27:21.920 --> 27:23.920
fart bomb.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.920
Actually, I think it's called a supersonic wave

27:25.920 --> 27:27.920
and they don't like the noise, which makes

27:27.920 --> 27:29.920
sense. You know, nature doesn't like loud

27:29.920 --> 27:31.920
noises. Can relate

27:31.920 --> 27:33.920
on a

27:33.920 --> 27:35.920
physiological...physiological?

27:35.920 --> 27:37.920
No, not physiological.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.920
Now, you can just skip quite a bit of combat

27:39.920 --> 27:41.920
if you're cheeky, but only

27:41.920 --> 27:43.920
if you're smart enough to do the things

27:43.920 --> 27:45.920
in the correct timing. I'm going to heal up.

27:45.920 --> 27:47.920
You can heal up naturally and it just

27:47.920 --> 27:49.920
means gentle for time. As I said, this game

27:49.920 --> 27:51.920
is super forgiving to new gamers.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.920
If you are into

27:53.920 --> 27:55.920
that fantasy element,

27:55.920 --> 27:57.920
am I to walk from here?

27:57.920 --> 27:59.920
I can walk from here.

28:01.920 --> 28:03.920
Nature doesn't like loud noises.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.920
Literally, the loudest of nature.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.920
The sea bomb or a big badonka,

28:11.920 --> 28:13.920
those are the two choices.

28:13.920 --> 28:15.920
I don't mind getting too big.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.920
No, sorry, I do mind getting too big.

28:17.920 --> 28:19.920
You gotta keep that pear-shaped bone.

28:19.920 --> 28:21.920
You know, like when I do that

28:21.920 --> 28:23.920
hand cam stream, everyone's

28:23.920 --> 28:25.920
going to know the real size of my

28:25.920 --> 28:27.920
chest.

28:39.920 --> 28:41.920
Yes, I

28:41.920 --> 28:43.920
will teach you all the strats of this game.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.920
And for those

28:45.920 --> 28:47.920
who are wondering, is this

28:47.920 --> 28:49.920
an adjourned stream? This is roughly

28:49.920 --> 28:51.920
a

28:51.920 --> 28:53.920
seven-hour

28:53.920 --> 28:55.920
strom.

28:55.920 --> 28:57.920
So do feel free to strum yourself

28:57.920 --> 28:59.920
for the full seven hours, if not,

28:59.920 --> 29:01.920
then the seven-hour stream.

29:01.920 --> 29:03.920
Roughly.

29:03.920 --> 29:05.920
I believe we will actually successfully

29:05.920 --> 29:07.920
catch Mercy for a redirect

29:07.920 --> 29:09.920
if my humble Mercy

29:09.920 --> 29:11.920
is streaming today, which I believe she is.

29:11.920 --> 29:13.920
As always, if any

29:13.920 --> 29:15.920
of my gen mates come online, please

29:15.920 --> 29:17.920
remind me and I will

29:17.920 --> 29:19.920
tell those who would

29:19.920 --> 29:21.920
much prefer to watch a game that isn't

29:21.920 --> 29:23.920
archaic, or whatever they're

29:23.920 --> 29:25.920
doing on stream.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.920
We're supposed to

29:27.920 --> 29:29.920
for seven hours. I feel

29:29.920 --> 29:31.920
like that would

29:31.920 --> 29:33.920
hurt.

29:33.920 --> 29:35.920
But anyway, because

29:35.920 --> 29:37.920
I cannot tell you how strange

29:37.920 --> 29:39.920
it was to go offline after

29:39.920 --> 29:41.920
two hours, it

29:41.920 --> 29:43.920
literally felt like, what do we

29:43.920 --> 29:45.920
do now? Oh, now we play the game.

29:45.920 --> 29:47.920
Because I was like, wait, I have

29:47.920 --> 29:49.920
so much time.

29:49.920 --> 29:51.920
So

29:51.920 --> 29:53.920
I've got three more

29:53.920 --> 29:55.920
ASMR collabs on the way. I did a little

29:55.920 --> 29:57.920
bit of socializing. We are now Navi.

29:57.920 --> 29:59.920
We're about to do some Navi quest lines.

29:59.920 --> 30:01.920
But please remember, we are

30:01.920 --> 30:03.920
RDA Navi.

30:03.920 --> 30:05.920
To use teleportations, we use

30:05.920 --> 30:07.920
the Tree of Vision. It's very

30:07.920 --> 30:09.920
important to get those because my goodness, it makes

30:09.920 --> 30:11.920
travel so much easier.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.920
Look how tall we are.

30:15.920 --> 30:17.920
And the camera angle has changed and

30:17.920 --> 30:19.920
is much more favorable.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.920
I prefer when

30:21.920 --> 30:23.920
video games have a really pulled

30:23.920 --> 30:25.920
out third perspective camera.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.920
If the camera is two centimeters

30:27.920 --> 30:29.920
away from my face, I do not like it.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.920
I find it very hard to look at.

30:31.920 --> 30:33.920
I don't know if that's because

30:33.920 --> 30:35.920
I need

30:35.920 --> 30:37.920
glasses and I still

30:37.920 --> 30:39.920
haven't trained myself to wear

30:39.920 --> 30:41.920
glasses.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.920
Very bad girl, bad girl, very

30:43.920 --> 30:45.920
naughty.

30:45.920 --> 30:47.920
But I think that my preference

30:47.920 --> 30:49.920
in video games is a zoom out angle.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.920
It might be related to that because

30:51.920 --> 30:53.920
yeah.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.920
But hey,

30:55.920 --> 30:57.920
does anyone know the full

30:57.920 --> 30:59.920
name of the game and it's on

30:59.920 --> 31:01.920
Steam? I

31:01.920 --> 31:03.920
don't even know if it's on

31:03.920 --> 31:05.920
Steam.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.920
It is called

31:07.920 --> 31:09.920
James Cameron's Avatar.

31:09.920 --> 31:11.920
Okay, the Navi can go through

31:11.920 --> 31:13.920
these doors. Nope.

31:13.920 --> 31:15.920
Only when they're green. Okay, sure, sure.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.920
We are about

31:17.920 --> 31:19.920
to encounter the wildlife. They will still

31:19.920 --> 31:21.920
attack us even if we are Navi

31:21.920 --> 31:23.920
and RDA.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.920
Does not matter. Where the heck

31:25.920 --> 31:27.920
am I going? I'm going the wrong way.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.920
That's why I'm getting turned around.

31:29.920 --> 31:31.920
Now again, we do have superpowers.

31:31.920 --> 31:33.920
We have sprint. We have invincibility.

31:33.920 --> 31:35.920
We have health. And we have

31:35.920 --> 31:37.920
ground smash, which is

31:37.920 --> 31:39.920
very good. In order

31:39.920 --> 31:41.920
to get healing

31:41.920 --> 31:43.920
if you look

31:43.920 --> 31:45.920
on when that health bar

31:45.920 --> 31:47.920
comes up again, you'll notice the number

31:47.920 --> 31:49.920
zero at the bottom left, on the right

31:49.920 --> 31:51.920
side of the health bar that appears

31:51.920 --> 31:53.920
bottom left. The more cell

31:53.920 --> 31:55.920
samples we pick up, the more

31:55.920 --> 31:57.920
second chances we have.

31:57.920 --> 31:59.920
Now it's very common to

31:59.920 --> 32:01.920
run out of health in this game.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.920
It's just the thing that happens.

32:03.920 --> 32:05.920
It's not a big deal. Again, the game

32:05.920 --> 32:07.920
is very forgiving. You can literally do

32:07.920 --> 32:09.920
this all the way through the game, and

32:09.920 --> 32:11.920
anything can hardly hit you.

32:11.920 --> 32:13.920
But the later sections of the game

32:13.920 --> 32:15.920
I don't know if there weren't

32:15.920 --> 32:17.920
many playtesters, because it was

32:17.920 --> 32:19.920
very rough in the later sections

32:19.920 --> 32:21.920
of the game. I've done that game pretty rough.

32:21.920 --> 32:23.920
We are going to unlock this Tree of Vision

32:23.920 --> 32:25.920
so now we can teleport to this region

32:25.920 --> 32:27.920
when we come back to 100%

32:27.920 --> 32:29.920
of the region.

32:31.920 --> 32:33.920
How many games do you have

32:33.920 --> 32:35.920
lined up? Do you mean

32:35.920 --> 32:37.920
to play in general?

32:37.920 --> 32:39.920
If you mean

32:39.920 --> 32:41.920
games overall

32:41.920 --> 32:43.920
like daily

32:43.920 --> 32:45.920
streaming games for a year?

32:45.920 --> 32:47.920
Question mark!

32:47.920 --> 32:49.920
Next week in

32:49.920 --> 32:51.920
endurance is Skyrim.

32:51.920 --> 32:53.920
It's another childhood game of mine.

32:53.920 --> 32:55.920
I used to

32:55.920 --> 32:57.920
do 100% achievements in Skyrim

32:57.920 --> 32:59.920
every year, because I really appreciate

32:59.920 --> 33:01.920
the game and its vanilla form. I do apologize

33:01.920 --> 33:03.920
if you like mullets, but...

33:03.920 --> 33:05.920
I don't know what to say.

33:05.920 --> 33:07.920
I'm very...

33:07.920 --> 33:09.920
We aren't friends?

33:09.920 --> 33:11.920
We aren't friends?

33:11.920 --> 33:13.920
Would you guys

33:13.920 --> 33:15.920
really

33:15.920 --> 33:17.920
appreciate a bit more?

33:17.920 --> 33:19.920
What?

33:19.920 --> 33:21.920
100?

33:25.920 --> 33:27.920
Also humans number one baby.

33:27.920 --> 33:29.920
No!

33:29.920 --> 33:31.920
Anonymous!

33:31.920 --> 33:33.920
No! Bad boy!

33:33.920 --> 33:35.920
Bad boy!

33:35.920 --> 33:37.920
Thank you for the 100.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.920
That's a lot of money though. Please make sure

33:39.920 --> 33:41.920
you're looking after yourself and treating yourself.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.920
100 is a lot. Jesus!

33:43.920 --> 33:45.920
Bad and on! Bad boy!

33:45.920 --> 33:47.920
Come get spankings right now. Bad!

33:49.920 --> 33:51.920
Let me take a sipping then.

33:51.920 --> 33:53.920
Are you squidding me right now?

33:53.920 --> 33:55.920
Good just me.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.920
Exactly, Nero!

34:03.920 --> 34:05.920
Exactly!

34:05.920 --> 34:07.920
We stand nature in this house.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.920
We will look after nature.

34:09.920 --> 34:11.920
As you can literally hear me dancing about

34:11.920 --> 34:13.920
in my chair right now.

34:13.920 --> 34:15.920
So we are...

34:15.920 --> 34:17.920
What the heck is that zone?

34:17.920 --> 34:19.920
And why is it so big? Oh, we're plant sampling.

34:19.920 --> 34:21.920
Okay, this is tutorial section.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.920
When I explained...

34:23.920 --> 34:25.920
Thank you for the tip again, Nero.

34:25.920 --> 34:27.920
Anonymous, my goodness, that was a lot of money.

34:27.920 --> 34:29.920
Please...

34:29.920 --> 34:31.920
Is something attacking me? No.

34:31.920 --> 34:33.920
When you pick up cell samples, there's that little

34:33.920 --> 34:35.920
white bar on the left side.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.920
I didn't... And you thought there was enemies

34:37.920 --> 34:39.920
because I was like, why am I getting...

34:39.920 --> 34:41.920
Playing as an avatar. As an avatar,

34:41.920 --> 34:43.920
Pondora's flora

34:43.920 --> 34:45.920
which means

34:45.920 --> 34:47.920
flowers

34:47.920 --> 34:49.920
and fauna

34:49.920 --> 34:51.920
means

34:51.920 --> 34:53.920
animals.

34:53.920 --> 34:55.920
Yes.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.920
It's less aggressive towards you.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.920
Therefore, killing an offensive creatures

34:59.920 --> 35:01.920
and plants will not yield

35:01.920 --> 35:03.920
experience points.

35:03.920 --> 35:05.920
All the reeflings siding with humans

35:05.920 --> 35:07.920
want to be the guy from Stronny's law video.

35:07.920 --> 35:09.920
Oh, I'm so bad.

35:09.920 --> 35:11.920
Hope a siren doesn't drown me.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.920
Thank you!

35:13.920 --> 35:15.920
Thank you, Anonymous, for the tip.

35:15.920 --> 35:17.920
Oh, you guys

35:17.920 --> 35:19.920
don't want me to, you know,

35:19.920 --> 35:21.920
take you down in the waters with me.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.920
That's not...

35:23.920 --> 35:25.920
Honestly, my lore is so evil.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.920
I promise. I don't want to...

35:27.920 --> 35:29.920
I don't want to hurt...

35:29.920 --> 35:31.920
Why do I suck so bad at this?

35:31.920 --> 35:33.920
Wait, what was that?

35:33.920 --> 35:35.920
No way! They have a slow motion kill cam!

35:35.920 --> 35:37.920
I did not

35:37.920 --> 35:39.920
recall that whatsoever.

35:39.920 --> 35:41.920
That's amazing.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.920
Don't threaten us with a good time.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.920
That sounds very yandere-esque.

35:45.920 --> 35:47.920
But, yeah, in terms of evilness

35:47.920 --> 35:49.920
and lore, why?

35:49.920 --> 35:51.920
What was that? I heard that.

35:51.920 --> 35:53.920
Oh, I can hear it!

35:53.920 --> 35:55.920
I actually got scared there.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.920
I heard it, but I couldn't turn

35:57.920 --> 35:59.920
the analog stick in time.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.920
So, if I am human...

36:01.920 --> 36:03.920
Why are there so many?

36:05.920 --> 36:07.920
Oh, no, I heard the plant.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.920
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Plant.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.920
I'm actually getting a bit scared.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.920
Why is there so many?

36:13.920 --> 36:15.920
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on,

36:15.920 --> 36:17.920
hold on, hold on, hold on. Pause.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.920
Pause! I hear more!

36:19.920 --> 36:21.920
Oh, my God, they're literally biting my ankles!

36:21.920 --> 36:23.920
They're biting my ankles!

36:23.920 --> 36:25.920
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

36:25.920 --> 36:27.920
Stop.

36:27.920 --> 36:29.920
Okay, relax.

36:29.920 --> 36:31.920
Relax.

36:31.920 --> 36:33.920
We're just collecting cell samples

36:33.920 --> 36:35.920
in this area. I think I've hurt every...

36:35.920 --> 36:37.920
All the enemies are gone.

36:37.920 --> 36:39.920
Yeah, so these

36:39.920 --> 36:41.920
type animals don't attack.

36:41.920 --> 36:43.920
They can't bite my ankles, man.

36:43.920 --> 36:45.920
If you are human and come across

36:45.920 --> 36:47.920
this plant, it is very

36:47.920 --> 36:49.920
poisonous. It spits a

36:49.920 --> 36:51.920
bale at you, which is actually really cool.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.920
But

36:53.920 --> 36:55.920
the design elements that went

36:55.920 --> 36:57.920
into this game is just

36:57.920 --> 36:59.920
beautifully...

36:59.920 --> 37:01.920
Or...

37:03.920 --> 37:05.920
But, yeah, like, the development,

37:05.920 --> 37:07.920
you can actually...

37:07.920 --> 37:09.920
Yeah, you can, like, scan...

37:09.920 --> 37:11.920
Who goes there? Who goes there?

37:11.920 --> 37:13.920
You can, like, scan stuff

37:13.920 --> 37:15.920
and add it to a database and that.

37:15.920 --> 37:17.920
I've never 100% of that. Maybe we could do that?

37:17.920 --> 37:19.920
Oh, no, we can't

37:19.920 --> 37:21.920
because I would have to play the RDA side.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.920
But I'm not playing the bad boy side.

37:23.920 --> 37:25.920
But, yeah, like, if you're into, like, 100%

37:25.920 --> 37:27.920
completion, absolutely can do that kind of thing.

37:31.920 --> 37:33.920
Oh.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.920
But it is...

37:35.920 --> 37:37.920
A very beautiful game.

37:37.920 --> 37:39.920
I am very much into, like, alternative, like...

37:39.920 --> 37:41.920
Oh.

37:41.920 --> 37:43.920
Oh. Oh.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.920
I saw that.

37:45.920 --> 37:47.920
It popped up my little thingies. I knew it.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.920
Right, where are we going? We're just heading next.

37:55.920 --> 37:57.920
We can do this

37:57.920 --> 37:59.920
and just kind of try and bypass

37:59.920 --> 38:01.920
all the enemies on the way.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.920
Enemies.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.920
Did you watch the second movie?

38:05.920 --> 38:07.920
I absolutely did.

38:07.920 --> 38:09.920
I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie

38:09.920 --> 38:11.920
with Jake Sully.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.920
Absolutely.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.920
Congrats, if your name's Jake, by the way.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.920
Absolutely

38:19.920 --> 38:21.920
fantastic movies.

38:21.920 --> 38:23.920
Completely captured me in that kind of fantasy

38:23.920 --> 38:25.920
different world.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.920
Especially the nighttime scenes

38:27.920 --> 38:29.920
when everything is lighten up.

38:29.920 --> 38:31.920
Oh, speaking of lighten up, hold on.

38:35.920 --> 38:37.920
Reactive model.

38:37.920 --> 38:39.920
You ready? Reactive model?

38:39.920 --> 38:41.920
Do you want this? Or do you want my normal model?

38:41.920 --> 38:43.920
I can turn it over.

38:43.920 --> 38:45.920
The bioluminescent scenes.

38:45.920 --> 38:47.920
Yes, bioluminescent scenes.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.920
Pushing boots to destroyed

38:51.920 --> 38:53.920
Avatar 2 in the box office.

38:57.920 --> 38:59.920
Woo! Our first meet with a navi.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.920
Like an actual navi.

39:01.920 --> 39:03.920
Not an RDA navi.

39:03.920 --> 39:05.920
Are you ready? Hello, Tanjala.

39:05.920 --> 39:07.920
Oh, I'm stuck on

39:07.920 --> 39:09.920
this corpse of a themobobber.

39:09.920 --> 39:11.920
Hello.

39:11.920 --> 39:13.920
Hello, I'm a kaya.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.920
This is good.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.920
Oh, Renee Harper is

39:25.920 --> 39:27.920
Sigourney Weaver.

39:27.920 --> 39:29.920
She's been poused with a navi.

39:29.920 --> 39:31.920
She overflicks them. Tanjala wants

39:31.920 --> 39:33.920
you to kill the

39:33.920 --> 39:35.920
sick strumb beasts.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.920
Anyone else identify themselves as a

39:37.920 --> 39:39.920
strumb beast? Cause

39:39.920 --> 39:41.920
that's ridiculous.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.920
We're really starting to dig hard

39:43.920 --> 39:45.920
for these words.

39:47.920 --> 39:49.920
Avatar 2 had no story at all.

39:49.920 --> 39:51.920
Perfect how not to make a sequel.

39:51.920 --> 39:53.920
I disagree. Brian!

39:53.920 --> 39:55.920
Don't worry, Stronny. I played

39:55.920 --> 39:57.920
navi 2 when I was younger.

39:57.920 --> 39:59.920
I liked having all the animals be

39:59.920 --> 40:01.920
my friends. Exactly, Grimbo.

40:01.920 --> 40:03.920
Thank you for the tip.

40:03.920 --> 40:05.920
We do, Brian. The first movie was just

40:05.920 --> 40:07.920
a crossover between Pocahontas and

40:07.920 --> 40:09.920
Ferngully. I have not seen Ferngully.

40:09.920 --> 40:11.920
Bejinga, thank you

40:11.920 --> 40:13.920
for the tip. What's Ferngully? Have you

40:13.920 --> 40:15.920
guys seen Ferngully?

40:15.920 --> 40:17.920
Are you doing your way to eat?

40:17.920 --> 40:19.920
You like

40:19.920 --> 40:21.920
Sigourney Weaver a lot.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.920
Sigourney Weaver

40:23.920 --> 40:25.920
the first thing I've seen her in

40:25.920 --> 40:27.920
were just to destroy these by the way.

40:27.920 --> 40:29.920
Sigourney Weaver Avatar

40:29.920 --> 40:31.920
was the first thing I ever saw her in.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.920
And I just adored her.

40:33.920 --> 40:35.920
I adored her character. Her voice

40:35.920 --> 40:37.920
is so lovely as well.

40:37.920 --> 40:39.920
It's such a...

40:39.920 --> 40:41.920
If you ever struggle at this

40:41.920 --> 40:43.920
point, just jump up on this rock right here.

40:43.920 --> 40:45.920
They can't hurt you

40:45.920 --> 40:47.920
if you go on the rock.

40:47.920 --> 40:49.920
They can't do a thing. If you're on the

40:49.920 --> 40:51.920
floor, these guys will knock you over

40:51.920 --> 40:53.920
and take a big chunk of your health.

40:53.920 --> 40:55.920
Is something else attacking me?

40:55.920 --> 40:57.920
No.

40:57.920 --> 40:59.920
But we're good to go.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.920
Robin Williams plays a bat in this.

41:07.920 --> 41:09.920
Ferngully is basically the

41:09.920 --> 41:11.920
Barbie Pixie...

41:11.920 --> 41:13.920
The Barbie Pixie movie

41:13.920 --> 41:15.920
in 2D, but human...

41:15.920 --> 41:17.920
It depends on that guy.

41:17.920 --> 41:19.920
It was a good movie.

41:19.920 --> 41:21.920
The direct to VHS

41:21.920 --> 41:23.920
was okay.

41:23.920 --> 41:25.920
Tim Curry sings.

41:25.920 --> 41:27.920
Oh my god, Rocky Horror Picture

41:27.920 --> 41:29.920
Show. You put your hands on

41:29.920 --> 41:31.920
your leg. No, that's not right.

41:31.920 --> 41:33.920
You put your hands on your hips.

41:33.920 --> 41:35.920
That's it.

41:39.920 --> 41:41.920
We should watch that.

41:41.920 --> 41:43.920
My mum

41:43.920 --> 41:45.920
really likes that movie.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.920
I've watched it from a young age.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.920
Yeah, it's absolutely bizarre

41:49.920 --> 41:51.920
to conceptualize what on earth happens

41:51.920 --> 41:53.920
in that movie at a young age.

41:53.920 --> 41:55.920
But hey ho, that's just life.

41:55.920 --> 41:57.920
That's just how it is.

41:57.920 --> 41:59.920
Oh, I heard.

41:59.920 --> 42:01.920
Butta Dog.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.920
I heard that.

42:03.920 --> 42:05.920
And mama.

42:05.920 --> 42:07.920
What are you doing here?

42:07.920 --> 42:09.920
I'm so tiny.

42:09.920 --> 42:11.920
Oh no, I'm so big.

42:11.920 --> 42:13.920
V, you're Azura.

42:13.920 --> 42:15.920
You're talking to Azura right now.

42:15.920 --> 42:17.920
This is the height difference between you and Azura.

42:17.920 --> 42:19.920
I'm shutting down the knob.

42:19.920 --> 42:21.920
It's Emmy and Azura.

42:21.920 --> 42:23.920
Oh, it's Emmy.

42:25.920 --> 42:27.920
A giant woman.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.920
Now, don't lie.

42:29.920 --> 42:31.920
Don't lie right now

42:31.920 --> 42:33.920
and say to me, I didn't cook

42:33.920 --> 42:35.920
with making Azura a giant test.

42:35.920 --> 42:37.920
I will not take...

42:37.920 --> 42:39.920
If that's not going to hurt me,

42:39.920 --> 42:41.920
I'm laying it boys.

42:41.920 --> 42:43.920
We're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it.

42:47.920 --> 42:49.920
We're just going to stealth through this section.

42:49.920 --> 42:51.920
There's a lot of dire wolves.

42:51.920 --> 42:53.920
Viper wolves.

42:53.920 --> 42:55.920
However, we're no interested

42:55.920 --> 42:57.920
in fighting.

42:57.920 --> 42:59.920
We're just going to zoom past

42:59.920 --> 43:01.920
because this entire section

43:01.920 --> 43:03.920
is optional honestly.

43:03.920 --> 43:05.920
We're just going to zoom ahead again.

43:05.920 --> 43:07.920
Cooked, you did indeed cook.

43:07.920 --> 43:09.920
No, I knew I wanted

43:09.920 --> 43:11.920
some sort of thick Vtuber model.

43:11.920 --> 43:13.920
I'm sorry, I'm going to say it.

43:13.920 --> 43:15.920
There's really not that much variety

43:15.920 --> 43:17.920
for the thick

43:17.920 --> 43:19.920
and for the chocolate.

43:19.920 --> 43:21.920
So, it was just

43:21.920 --> 43:23.920
absolutely no questions asked.

43:23.920 --> 43:25.920
Probably going to do the same in Gen 2

43:25.920 --> 43:27.920
where, you know, something's going to be lovely.

43:27.920 --> 43:29.920
Brian!

43:35.920 --> 43:37.920
Awwww.

43:37.920 --> 43:39.920
Is she the main...

43:39.920 --> 43:41.920
Is she the main alien?

43:41.920 --> 43:43.920
Because I remember reading a really...

43:43.920 --> 43:45.920
Oh, we're on a horse by the way.

43:45.920 --> 43:47.920
Check it out. Look at my horse.

43:47.920 --> 43:49.920
My horse is amazing.

43:49.920 --> 43:51.920
Oh my god, his face is all...

43:51.920 --> 43:53.920
That's a really unfortunate face.

43:53.920 --> 43:55.920
But everything else, yeah, it's alright.

43:57.920 --> 43:59.920
Look, I'm riding a pony. I'm such a girl.

44:01.920 --> 44:03.920
Oh my god, this is the girls game as well.

44:03.920 --> 44:05.920
Oh, there's actually a really... This is really boring.

44:05.920 --> 44:07.920
But when we come back to this section later,

44:07.920 --> 44:09.920
an enemy always spawns on this rock

44:09.920 --> 44:11.920
and he's infinite stuck

44:11.920 --> 44:13.920
and you can never, like, hurt him.

44:13.920 --> 44:15.920
Well...

44:15.920 --> 44:17.920
Okay.

44:17.920 --> 44:19.920
It's time. We need to make a decision.

44:19.920 --> 44:21.920
Are we Navi?

44:21.920 --> 44:23.920
Thank you very much, Iron Reaper, for the tip.

44:23.920 --> 44:25.920
I think I actually forgot to say that.

44:25.920 --> 44:27.920
But thank you for the tip.

44:27.920 --> 44:29.920
Are you squidding me right now?

44:29.920 --> 44:31.920
Nero!

44:33.920 --> 44:35.920
Thank you, Nero, for the tip.

44:39.920 --> 44:41.920
So we are a signal specialist

44:43.920 --> 44:45.920
and we've set those signals up

44:45.920 --> 44:47.920
but we were told that they weren't gonna...

44:47.920 --> 44:49.920
It wasn't gonna be used for destroying Navi.

44:51.920 --> 44:53.920
Nory, Nory.

45:03.920 --> 45:05.920
Great work, Ryder.

45:05.920 --> 45:07.920
I smell promotion in the air.

45:07.920 --> 45:09.920
Do you realize what you're doing?

45:09.920 --> 45:11.920
Think about what you're doing.

45:11.920 --> 45:13.920
Any of this look familiar?

45:13.920 --> 45:15.920
Wait, that's...

45:17.920 --> 45:19.920
So we're learning we just destroyed all the Navi's home?

45:23.920 --> 45:25.920
I didn't do this.

45:25.920 --> 45:27.920
Everyone's hearing about it.

45:27.920 --> 45:29.920
The new SIG spec locked the target.

45:29.920 --> 45:31.920
What the hell did you think you were doing?

45:31.920 --> 45:33.920
They told me it was...

45:33.920 --> 45:35.920
Are we the baddies?

45:37.920 --> 45:39.920
They used you, Ryder.

45:43.920 --> 45:45.920
Ryder? Hardly even nor.

45:47.920 --> 45:49.920
Oh wait, sorry, sorry.

45:49.920 --> 45:51.920
Hold on, do that again.

45:51.920 --> 45:53.920
Ryder? Hardly even nor.

45:53.920 --> 45:55.920
Hardly even nor.

46:05.920 --> 46:07.920
Come on, how goofy is that?

46:09.920 --> 46:11.920
I wanted to see...

46:11.920 --> 46:13.920
Ray, are you ready? Are you ready? We're gonna do it again.

46:15.920 --> 46:17.920
Okay, hold on.

46:17.920 --> 46:19.920
Let's do this bit and then when we're mucking about I'll do it again, okay?

46:19.920 --> 46:21.920
That was amazing.

46:24.920 --> 46:26.920
Right, so this is where you decide.

46:26.920 --> 46:28.920
Do you want to be Navi or do you want to be RDA?

46:28.920 --> 46:30.920
If I shoot him, we become RDA.

46:30.920 --> 46:32.920
If I shoot him...

46:32.920 --> 46:34.920
WE BECOME NAVI!

46:34.920 --> 46:36.920
And defend this Pandora

46:36.920 --> 46:38.920
in the name of being a foreigner.

46:38.920 --> 46:40.920
We need to kill it. We guys first go.

46:40.920 --> 46:42.920
Destroy him!

46:42.920 --> 46:44.920
Just... Oh, I'm low health.

46:44.920 --> 46:46.920
Oh my god, I'm farting about too much.

46:46.920 --> 46:48.920
Oh, why is he so strong?

46:48.920 --> 46:50.920
Right, go...

46:50.920 --> 46:52.920
Wait, I'm actually gonna get...

46:52.920 --> 46:54.920
I'm gonna perish.

46:54.920 --> 46:56.920
He's like actually wrecking and decking me.

46:56.920 --> 46:58.920
What's going on?

46:58.920 --> 47:00.920
Why is his health not going down?

47:00.920 --> 47:02.920
Why is my aim bot so bad?

47:02.920 --> 47:04.920
Right, hold on, hold on.

47:04.920 --> 47:06.920
Hold on, let me aim bot.

47:06.920 --> 47:08.920
He healed up! No, no!

47:08.920 --> 47:10.920
Only I'm allowed to heal up.

47:12.920 --> 47:14.920
The enemies shouldn't be allowed to heal up.

47:14.920 --> 47:16.920
It should be illegal in video games.

47:16.920 --> 47:18.920
Development team, you have failed.

47:18.920 --> 47:20.920
It should be...

47:20.920 --> 47:22.920
He's shooting me as well.

47:22.920 --> 47:24.920
Can you like shoot the other guy?

47:24.920 --> 47:26.920
Right, hold on. Let me readjust this aim bot.

47:26.920 --> 47:28.920
No, he healed up!

47:28.920 --> 47:30.920
Only I'm supposed to have him healed up!

47:30.920 --> 47:32.920
Right, that's it.

47:32.920 --> 47:34.920
Grimped!

47:34.920 --> 47:36.920
Didn't even work. Did it work?

47:36.920 --> 47:38.920
I don't know.

47:38.920 --> 47:40.920
I'm gonna be honest, this is a few too many bullets

47:40.920 --> 47:42.920
are going through you.

47:42.920 --> 47:44.920
I spoke too many bullets.

47:44.920 --> 47:46.920
He survived all those bullets.

47:50.920 --> 47:52.920
He grabbed your dire horse.

47:52.920 --> 47:54.920
Dire horse?

47:54.920 --> 47:56.920
Banshee!

47:56.920 --> 47:58.920
Iknu-i-ma-ya

47:58.920 --> 48:00.920
Iknu-i-ma-ya

48:00.920 --> 48:02.920
No idea who I'm supposed to see.

48:02.920 --> 48:04.920
Iknu-i-ma-ya

48:04.920 --> 48:06.920
Iknu-i-ma-ya

48:06.920 --> 48:08.920
Sounds like I'm trying to say something in the dark.

48:08.920 --> 48:10.920
I...

48:10.920 --> 48:12.920
Iqalvanyu?

48:12.920 --> 48:14.920
It's not Iqalvanyu.

48:16.920 --> 48:18.920
Got anything better than bows and arrows?

48:20.920 --> 48:22.920
Those are the only weapons they need.

48:22.920 --> 48:24.920
Great. Good choice, Ryder.

48:24.920 --> 48:26.920
Iknu-i-ma-ya.

48:26.920 --> 48:28.920
Couldn't humans kill the main guys?

48:28.920 --> 48:30.920
Human body in the machines?

48:30.920 --> 48:32.920
Yes.

48:32.920 --> 48:34.920
That's very true, but...

48:34.920 --> 48:36.920
It was arranged that the...

48:36.920 --> 48:38.920
Oh, look at her! We stunning on them!

48:38.920 --> 48:40.920
Look at this, got a little outfit of the day moment check.

48:40.920 --> 48:42.920
Oh, come on!

48:42.920 --> 48:44.920
Look at my dual-wield blades!

48:44.920 --> 48:46.920
Come on, that's so cool!

48:46.920 --> 48:48.920
Oh, how did I hit?

48:48.920 --> 48:50.920
Oh, that's so cool!

48:50.920 --> 48:52.920
Come on, that's so cool.

48:52.920 --> 48:54.920
I'm sorry, but look how cool that...

48:54.920 --> 48:56.920
Oh my god, that's terrifying!

48:56.920 --> 48:58.920
Imagine that running at you.

48:58.920 --> 49:00.920
Oh, I just crap myself right there.

49:00.920 --> 49:02.920
Your avatar isn't blonde

49:02.920 --> 49:04.920
because blonde doesn't exist in Navi, I don't think.

49:04.920 --> 49:06.920
Maybe it does, I don't know.

49:06.920 --> 49:08.920
I don't think I recall seeing a blonde Navi.

49:08.920 --> 49:10.920
Oh no, I do!

49:10.920 --> 49:12.920
In the different regions of...

49:12.920 --> 49:14.920
But we are jungle Navi.

49:14.920 --> 49:16.920
This is jungle Navi.

49:16.920 --> 49:18.920
There aren't, like, types of Navi

49:18.920 --> 49:20.920
or jungle Navi.

49:24.920 --> 49:26.920
Sadly, not closer to your level plus.

49:40.920 --> 49:42.920
We need to win his approval.

49:42.920 --> 49:44.920
Oh my god, she's so real for that.

49:50.920 --> 49:52.920
Okay, we need to try and get the approval

49:52.920 --> 49:54.920
of this guy.

49:54.920 --> 49:56.920
Why?

49:56.920 --> 49:58.920
I've already forgotten the plot,

49:58.920 --> 50:00.920
but we're gonna do it anyway.

50:00.920 --> 50:02.920
But basically, we are full Navi right now

50:02.920 --> 50:04.920
and I'm gonna tell you some...

50:04.920 --> 50:06.920
Okay, this really is a girls game

50:06.920 --> 50:08.920
because every time we go to our next location

50:08.920 --> 50:10.920
we unlock new outfits as we level up

50:10.920 --> 50:12.920
and I get to, like, play a little wardrobe simulator.

50:12.920 --> 50:14.920
Oh, such a girls game.

50:20.920 --> 50:22.920
Yeah, he ain't happy at all to see me in.

50:24.920 --> 50:26.920
Oh, I need to be able to ride a Banshee

50:26.920 --> 50:28.920
or an Ekran, that's what they're called.

50:28.920 --> 50:30.920
Traitor.

50:30.920 --> 50:32.920
Oh my god.

50:32.920 --> 50:34.920
Hold on, I need to be able to lay feet

50:34.920 --> 50:36.920
because I'm hurting my legs against the table.

50:36.920 --> 50:38.920
Did I just skip dialogue in that?

50:39.920 --> 50:41.920
New outfits, let's go to the next area.

50:41.920 --> 50:43.920
Oh my god, fashion simulator.

50:43.920 --> 50:45.920
We played Landlord Simulator on Brotherhood.

50:45.920 --> 50:47.920
Now we're playing fashion simulator on Avatar.

50:50.920 --> 50:52.920
Right, we are about to learn

50:52.920 --> 50:54.920
a motherfucking bow and arrow.

50:56.920 --> 50:58.920
Oh, did not mean to do that one.

50:58.920 --> 51:00.920
Let's try that again.

51:00.920 --> 51:02.920
Pardon me, excuse me, that was very daft.

51:02.920 --> 51:04.920
I just absolutely threw myself off the mat there.

51:04.920 --> 51:06.920
How do I zoom in on the bow and arrow again?

51:07.920 --> 51:09.920
Not that one.

51:09.920 --> 51:11.920
Oh wow, it's just hold and release.

51:11.920 --> 51:13.920
Okay, who would've thunk?

51:13.920 --> 51:15.920
Who would've thunk, it's just hold and release.

51:16.920 --> 51:19.920
The Navi's drip is indeed real true.

51:19.920 --> 51:22.920
This game seems surprisingly competent, actually.

51:22.920 --> 51:24.920
I was doubting, I get game.

51:24.920 --> 51:26.920
Honestly, I get game.

51:26.920 --> 51:28.920
Wait, what am I doing?

51:28.920 --> 51:31.920
Oh, we're doing our first human kill.

51:32.920 --> 51:34.920
Oh.

51:34.920 --> 51:36.920
We are.

51:36.920 --> 51:38.920
Yeah, the aim is very forgiving.

51:38.920 --> 51:40.920
If you want an easy game,

51:40.920 --> 51:42.920
definitely recommend this game.

51:42.920 --> 51:45.920
The bow and arrow is very satisfactory.

51:45.920 --> 51:47.920
But I'll tell you one thing though.

51:47.920 --> 51:49.920
Oh look at this camera,

51:49.920 --> 51:51.920
look how terrible this camera,

51:51.920 --> 51:53.920
it like pings off of different,

51:53.920 --> 51:55.920
like you can see the markers

51:55.920 --> 51:57.920
of where they put the tracking to do that.

51:57.920 --> 51:59.920
Like it's not smooth.

52:00.920 --> 52:02.920
Oh my god, who goes there?

52:04.920 --> 52:06.920
Identify yourself.

52:10.920 --> 52:13.920
First human after killing two low level,

52:13.920 --> 52:16.920
so actually true, I just recalled that.

52:16.920 --> 52:20.920
Really willy-nilly killing over here.

52:20.920 --> 52:22.920
Any willy killers?

52:22.920 --> 52:24.920
No, don't.

52:24.920 --> 52:26.920
This is another armor we can't get to unlock

52:26.920 --> 52:28.920
about later on, it's not quite the same.

52:29.920 --> 52:32.920
But here, we speak to Bower

52:32.920 --> 52:34.920
a word for it.

52:44.920 --> 52:46.920
Yeah.

52:50.920 --> 52:52.920
The scale of the arrows are massive, they are.

52:52.920 --> 52:54.920
Like Navi are so big.

52:55.920 --> 53:00.920
So there wasn't a big tree in the game?

53:00.920 --> 53:03.920
Oh, we aren't at the end of the game yet,

53:03.920 --> 53:05.920
you just hold on to that though.

53:05.920 --> 53:07.920
You're a couple of missions ahead,

53:07.920 --> 53:09.920
but I like doing two things.

53:15.920 --> 53:18.920
They don't disconnect us for treason, honestly.

53:19.920 --> 53:25.920
She wants the braid tail?

53:25.920 --> 53:28.920
What happens if we braid tails with each other?

53:28.920 --> 53:31.920
Is that like a marriage proposal with Navi?

53:39.920 --> 53:41.920
Oh, that's his wife? Oops.

53:48.920 --> 53:50.920
What do you say?

53:50.920 --> 53:52.920
To K?

53:52.920 --> 53:54.920
Will you help us?

53:54.920 --> 53:56.920
These boxes are explosives.

53:56.920 --> 53:58.920
TNT?

53:58.920 --> 54:00.920
Yes, we have word for this.

54:00.920 --> 54:02.920
Kangangang.

54:02.920 --> 54:04.920
Oh, that's so satisfying to say.

54:04.920 --> 54:06.920
Kangangang!

54:12.920 --> 54:14.920
I messed with that.

54:14.920 --> 54:16.920
You can flip into the waterfall to get down here a bit faster

54:17.920 --> 54:20.920
I will heal, but I shouldn't have done that.

54:20.920 --> 54:23.920
I thought you could slip down without too much.

54:23.920 --> 54:27.920
Oh, you have 50 bow and every time you get a sample,

54:27.920 --> 54:30.920
you replenish your bow and arrow ammunition.

54:30.920 --> 54:33.920
So all those green is more bows.

54:35.920 --> 54:38.920
Genghis Khan? Okay, you're done.

54:40.920 --> 54:42.920
Excuse me, pardon me, coming through,

54:42.920 --> 54:45.920
you guys can't aim, oh I can't aim either, it's fine.

54:45.920 --> 54:49.920
Okay, I think because my keyboard is registering,

54:49.920 --> 54:51.920
hello?

54:51.920 --> 54:53.920
Hello?

54:53.920 --> 54:56.920
Okay, I think because my keyboard is registering,

54:56.920 --> 55:01.920
the aim assist isn't being as active as it is normally

55:01.920 --> 55:07.920
on Xbox, because I could have sworn I didn't even have to aim.

55:08.920 --> 55:14.920
Oh, jeez, they just disappear.

55:14.920 --> 55:18.920
Okay, we seem to get either 5 or 10 arrows from samples,

55:18.920 --> 55:21.920
which is pretty good, I would say that's pretty good.

55:21.920 --> 55:23.920
Kangangang.

55:23.920 --> 55:25.920
Tanzu Simulator, actually.

55:25.920 --> 55:27.920
I prefer the bow and arrows myself,

55:27.920 --> 55:30.920
but I'll tell you something that's really sad about this game.

55:30.920 --> 55:36.920
As we level up, our equipment also becomes stronger in nature, okay?

55:36.920 --> 55:41.920
However, if you did not purchase the special edition,

55:41.920 --> 55:46.920
which they made about 1000 copies of for some unknown reason,

55:46.920 --> 55:49.920
if they didn't do the special, if you didn't buy it,

55:49.920 --> 55:52.920
your bow does not one-shot the enemies as you level up,

55:52.920 --> 55:57.920
it is complete nonsense, they made only so few copies.

55:57.920 --> 56:02.920
I was like, oh do you see how that flower attack is attacking them,

56:02.920 --> 56:05.920
and they're taking poison damage.

56:05.920 --> 56:10.920
So unfortunately, our bow and arrow, I can't even see them through the...

56:10.920 --> 56:12.920
Braw, why are you missing?

56:12.920 --> 56:14.920
Braw.

56:14.920 --> 56:17.920
You do heal over time naturally when there's no fight,

56:17.920 --> 56:20.920
so you don't always have to spam heals, what's this?

56:20.920 --> 56:22.920
What's that?

56:22.920 --> 56:24.920
Ammo, I thought my ammo...

56:24.920 --> 56:27.920
Whoa, wait, what do I have access to?

56:27.920 --> 56:32.920
So dual wield, one big ass swing,

56:32.920 --> 56:34.920
a gun and a bow, right?

56:34.920 --> 56:36.920
I normally just stick the bow.

56:36.920 --> 56:38.920
Very good.

56:38.920 --> 56:41.920
Very good, very nice.

56:41.920 --> 56:45.920
But overall, game is very forgiving.

56:45.920 --> 56:49.920
If you're ever interested, we should do that, but that comes later.

56:49.920 --> 56:51.920
We'll always come...

56:51.920 --> 56:54.920
Oh, the acran just said bye to that,

56:54.920 --> 56:56.920
I'm pretty sure they would have got mowed over,

56:56.920 --> 57:00.920
but look, as long as they're happy, I'm happy.

57:00.920 --> 57:03.920
So right now, we're picking up our boom, boom, gang of con.

57:03.920 --> 57:05.920
Do you mind?

57:05.920 --> 57:06.920
Where did you come from?

57:06.920 --> 57:09.920
You weren't even there, you're such a liar.

57:09.920 --> 57:11.920
You're lying to me.

57:11.920 --> 57:12.920
Where are they?

57:12.920 --> 57:15.920
I hear them.

57:15.920 --> 57:19.920
Snape, and not Snape, I am low health, that's okay.

57:19.920 --> 57:22.920
We're gonna heal up like that, she can heal up,

57:22.920 --> 57:23.920
and then we're just gonna move...

57:23.920 --> 57:25.920
Oh, we're not gonna move on to the next section,

57:25.920 --> 57:26.920
we're gonna go invisible.

57:26.920 --> 57:28.920
Oh, no we're not, why?

57:28.920 --> 57:31.920
Can you still...

57:31.920 --> 57:33.920
I don't know if you saw that, this Trippid,

57:33.920 --> 57:35.920
those flies were attacking him,

57:35.920 --> 57:38.920
like literally Pandora is so nice to you when you're napping.

57:38.920 --> 57:39.920
I love it.

57:39.920 --> 57:42.920
Oh, I hear them.

57:42.920 --> 57:43.920
I...

57:43.920 --> 57:47.920
Oh, so these are bombs that fly into you.

57:47.920 --> 57:51.920
I'm pretty sure I heard a guy's voice though.

57:51.920 --> 57:54.920
I'm like 99% sure I heard a guy saying they're out there,

57:54.920 --> 57:56.920
but I didn't see it.

57:56.920 --> 57:58.920
I love the way you say jaw wield.

57:58.920 --> 57:59.920
Oh, no.

57:59.920 --> 58:01.920
Wait, does it say differently?

58:01.920 --> 58:02.920
Jew...

58:02.920 --> 58:04.920
Jewel wield?

58:04.920 --> 58:06.920
Jewel wield.

58:06.920 --> 58:08.920
Jewel.

58:08.920 --> 58:11.920
Pandora thinks humans are an infection.

58:11.920 --> 58:15.920
They are, they're terrible.

58:15.920 --> 58:17.920
When you play RDF, it's just as truly similar.

58:17.920 --> 58:21.920
Oh, that's hilarious, honestly.

58:21.920 --> 58:23.920
It's such a good game.

58:23.920 --> 58:25.920
It's such a good game.

58:25.920 --> 58:28.920
I love this game so much.

58:28.920 --> 58:31.920
The only complaint I have about this game,

58:31.920 --> 58:35.920
it was made when games like to do...

58:35.920 --> 58:36.920
Why?

58:36.920 --> 58:39.920
It's like I have to aim a little to the right.

58:39.920 --> 58:40.920
I do.

58:40.920 --> 58:43.920
I've aimed a little to the right.

58:43.920 --> 58:45.920
We can go down or up.

58:45.920 --> 58:49.920
My memory says up, question mark.

58:49.920 --> 58:52.920
Jewel wield.

58:52.920 --> 58:54.920
Jewel wield.

58:54.920 --> 58:58.920
Well, my memory was correct.

58:58.920 --> 59:03.920
Oh, he got a little ambitious with trying to hurt me there.

59:03.920 --> 59:04.920
Where is this?

59:04.920 --> 59:05.920
It's up there?

59:05.920 --> 59:06.920
Oh, it might be up there.

59:06.920 --> 59:09.920
Whoa, I just spotted you in the corner of my eye.

59:09.920 --> 59:12.920
Yeah, these are literally, you know,

59:12.920 --> 59:13.920
I don't know what they're called.

59:13.920 --> 59:16.920
Those bombs that are for submarines under the water.

59:16.920 --> 59:17.920
I don't know what their name is,

59:17.920 --> 59:21.920
but that's what those are, but in the air.

59:21.920 --> 59:22.920
Oh, I missed.

59:22.920 --> 59:27.920
Yeah, the aim ball in this game, aim working.

59:27.920 --> 59:30.920
Aim ball, please.

59:30.920 --> 59:32.920
Wait, he didn't perish?

59:32.920 --> 59:35.920
Jeez.

59:35.920 --> 59:37.920
It looks like they're...

59:37.920 --> 59:39.920
Oh, we need to shoot that.

59:39.920 --> 59:41.920
Hold on.

59:41.920 --> 59:44.920
Wait, do we actually?

59:44.920 --> 59:46.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:46.920 --> 59:48.920
Don't remember this part of the game.

59:49.920 --> 59:52.920
What's the rocks for?

59:52.920 --> 59:54.920
Am I to destroy these?

59:54.920 --> 59:57.920
No way.

59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.920
Yeah, so I'm using bullets too.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.920
Aim ball, aim mort.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.920
More like sense ball, aim mort.

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:08.920
Why?

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.920
The aim assist is not like me.

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:13.920
I'm not actually going to claim that tree of nature.

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:14.920
That's what...

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:15.920
Tree of nature.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.920
Travel point because...

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.920
Holy crap.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.920
Oh, no, I don't have unlimited ammo.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:27.920
I thought I had unlimited ammo.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:28.920
Jeez.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:30.920
What did that do as a child that made...

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.920
It really must just be the aim assist.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.920
Because I think if you all one-shot everything,

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.920
there's like no way this stuff is even hurting me.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:38.920
Half as much.

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:39.920
Oh, I missed.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.920
I shot, and I missed again.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:42.920
And then I shot.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.920
And then I missed again.

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:45.920
And again.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.920
I don't know how to unshoot.

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:48.920
I can't pick up ammo from that.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.920
I can only pick up ammo shells.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:54.920
Honestly, let's see if we can get away with this.

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:58.920
Because we just need to pick up the package and then go.

01:00:58.920 --> 01:00:59.920
Oh, wow.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:00.920
Okay, cutscene time.

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:01.920
Cutscene time.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.920
Whoa.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.920
Gang gang gang.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.920
Gang is gone.

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.920
Okay, let's get the heck out of here

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.920
because I don't want to get hurt

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.920
any more than we need to.

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.920
I heard that belief and I was going to go for it.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.920
I think we're about to get an early crown.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.920
Long story short, I missed.

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.920
Yeah, I missed a lot.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:30.920
And then I shot.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:31.920
And then I shot.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.920
And then I missed again.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.920
Thumb a right.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:38.920
Oh.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.920
Okay, we're about to climb.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:45.920
Climb, climb, climb, climb.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.920
Yeah, I think the campaign mode is roughly seven hours.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:53.920
We could probably come back in 100% the sectors.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.920
And we can also play this mini conquest game,

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:58.920
which actually I really enjoyed as a kid.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.920
But you have to do it at the end of the game

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.920
for like 100% success rate.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:07.920
There are Viper Wolves ahead,

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.920
but we're just going to be cheeky and do this.

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.920
And then we completely negate

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:14.920
even having to fight a lot of them.

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:19.920
Unfortunately, invisibility.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:24.920
Invincibility is when they can't hurt you.

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:28.920
Invisibility is when they can't sneak.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.920
It doesn't last forever,

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.920
but as we level up,

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.920
like, oh, actually, we're really close to leveling up.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.920
I don't know if I should.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.920
I don't want to hurt the wolves.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.920
I don't want to hurt the wolves,

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:41.920
but I'll kill the humans.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:42.920
No problem.

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:43.920
Yeah, no, that's fine.

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:44.920
That's fine.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:47.920
Yeah, that thing, that thing.

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.920
It's friendly fire on.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.920
No, you cannot hurt other navi.

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:52.920
Now that you're a navi side,

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.920
I assume it's the same if you pick RDA.

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.920
Oh, good snipe.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.920
Oh, good snipe.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:04.920
Okay, if I can take my time to, like, properly even.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.920
No, I think I was out of range.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.920
There is a range to your attacks.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:10.920
Like, you can't...

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.920
No, no, I just suck.

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:13.920
There we go.

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.920
There is a range distance to your attacks.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:18.920
I cannot for the life of the human.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.920
Am I to go this way?

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.920
Am I to go this way?

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:26.920
No, classic dead end.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:28.920
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:29.920
Mom, get the camera.

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.920
Play of the game, honestly.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:36.920
Did you guys see that Marvel superhero, like, 5v5?

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.920
I hear a bomb.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.920
I see a bomb.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:43.920
Um, um, um, um, um.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:44.920
I really don't want the bomb to get me.

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.920
Oh, I'm already out of invista.

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:48.920
And the bomb is chasing me.

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.920
Okay, we're doing it.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.920
We're just going for it.

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:51.920
We're committing.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.920
Did anyone play it?

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:54.920
Marvel rivals.

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:55.920
Yeah.

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.920
It looks so good.

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.920
Everyone was, like, dogging on it,

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.920
but I'm like, oh, I actually really enjoyed the look of it.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.920
I'm installing the game now just to kill the Navi.

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:10.920
You know what?

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:11.920
You're done.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:13.920
You're done.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.920
I'm definitely going to play Marvel Overwatch when it comes out.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.920
Yeah, and then wasn't there not another company

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:22.920
that came out with another Overwatch-style game?

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:25.920
I think development teams literally watched,

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:27.920
like, the mess up in real time.

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.920
I don't know if that thing's still chasing me, but...

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:33.920
There is another one.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.920
Yeah, like Scarlet Witch's Moira and all that.

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:36.920
Yeah.

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:37.920
I used to play a lot of Overwatch.

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:39.920
I actually really enjoyed the game,

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:41.920
but I just don't play it anymore.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.920
Like, I don't find it rewarding or...

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:46.920
Which is such a shame,

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:49.920
because I've poured a lot of hours into that game.

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:54.920
But I would absolutely love if we could do Marvel rivals together.

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.920
It's like a stream snag game, like...

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.920
I don't know how the accounts work,

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:03.920
but I'm like 99% sure I can make a dummy account

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:06.920
and then, like, add user's friends

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:09.920
and then make note of who's, like, played

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.920
and then just rotate between, like, kind of what we...

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:12.920
Oh, here we go.

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:13.920
Level up.

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.920
What did I unlock?

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:15.920
Let's see.

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.920
Bam knee pack.

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:21.920
We have a club weapon with fricking spears on it

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:23.920
or another type of RDA gun.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.920
Oh, and a shot and a missed.

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:28.920
Oh, and a missed again.

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.920
I can hear an enemy.

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:31.920
I don't see him.

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:32.920
Oh, there he is.

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:38.920
That wasn't him that said that.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.920
Oh well, whatever, whatever.

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.920
Blizzard is horrible with their IPs yet.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:47.920
Time to go back to Team Fortress 2, honestly.

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:51.920
But I could have sworn I saw another development team

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:53.920
come out with something that was similar

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.920
out to the format as well.

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.920
So I think literally everyone watched,

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.920
Overwatch 2 come out

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.920
and as soon as Jeff Kaplan left the development team,

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:05.920
I think everyone behind the scenes

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.920
knew what on Earth was up

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.920
and knew it was, like, essentially going to flop

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:14.920
due to the change in gameplay.

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:18.920
But when Marvel Rivals does come out,

01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:21.920
because I think it's in beta right now,

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.920
or I may be wrong,

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.920
but I'm happy to make a dummy account.

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.920
We'll make it a multiplayer game

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:31.920
and we'll just kind of add...

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.920
I think it's 5v5, so it means four reeflings

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.920
and myself can play at the same time

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.920
against just randomers.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.920
We'll, like, play actual public match games

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.920
unless you guys really wanted to go against each other.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.920
I'm not sure having me and your team

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.920
will be a good idea, though,

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.920
because I'm not very strong at the game

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.920
and I can't play it.

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.920
But if that's something you guys are down for,

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:55.920
I'm heking down for it as well.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.920
Obviously, we'll remove everyone

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:00.920
at the end of the gaming session

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.920
and restart fresh.

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:04.920
As I said, it'll be...

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.920
I saw that...

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.920
I don't know if I'm going to get...

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:10.920
Right, I'm backing off, I'm backing off.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.920
I don't think...

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:14.920
We don't take that down yet.

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:17.920
No, that part comes later on.

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:20.920
I didn't...

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.920
No, I'm going to pick this up.

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.920
There we go.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.920
Team Landers, Johnny.

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.920
Should I tell everyone what to do?

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.920
Protect me! Heal me! Heal me!

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:32.920
I used to play Zarya,

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:34.920
which is an offensive tank

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.920
in...

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.920
Overwatch.

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.920
Oh my god, they're so beautiful!

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:42.920
I love...

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.920
The music's changed.

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:47.920
Oh, they're so beautiful.

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.920
The Ikran.

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:52.920
Look at them all judging me.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.920
That's okay, you can judge me.

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:57.920
Look at them, they're so pretty!

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.920
Hello, please don't attack me.

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.920
They're so beautiful.

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:10.920
Please understand, this game's a little old,

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.920
which is why they're all the same color.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.920
Please forgive, please forgive.

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:17.920
But I assume the new avatar is really beautiful.

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.920
My Ikran literally almost made me perish

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.920
and then said, yeah, alright, I'll pick you up.

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.920
I got pranked by it.

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:28.920
I literally done a little pranky on me.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.920
A little pranky-wanky.

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.920
No, no.

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:36.920
It's not a good look, honestly.

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:38.920
I mean, you would really choose

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.920
match over...

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:42.920
Pickle over the big birdie?

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.920
Exactly.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.920
Why don't you pick?

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:48.920
Oh, look at us, we're soaring.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.920
We're soaring.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.920
We're soaring.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.920
We're soaring.

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.920
We're soaring.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.920
We're soaring.

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.920
We're soaring.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.920
We're soaring.

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:04.920
We're soaring.

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.920
We're soaring.

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.920
Wee!

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.920
Oh, ouch, ouch.

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:12.920
Sorry, your wing, your wing.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:14.920
My apologies, sorry.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.920
I didn't mean to hurt your wing, little Banshee.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.920
But thank you for being so forgiving.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.920
We're just flying through the map now.

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.920
Banshee's have an insane HP.

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.920
We will be shot at as we go around.

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.920
I don't know if you read that really quickly.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.920
It said lifting the fog, 50%.

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:32.920
Don't worry.

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.920
Oh, we really need to get some height.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.920
Oh, I'm going to do a little cheeky 360

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.920
to get that height there.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.920
We are about to reach the ceiling in this game.

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:42.920
We are about to reach the ceiling in this game.

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.920
We are about to reach the ceiling in this game.

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:46.920
We are about to reach the ceiling in this game.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.920
Alright, climb, climb.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.920
Jeez, this map has a lot of verticality.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.920
Definitely did not remember that.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.920
But yes, there was a sector challenge

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:56.920
that says lifting the fog.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.920
There's a few sector challenges.

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.920
Depending on how long the campaign takes,

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:04.920
we might actually just 100%

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.920
all the sections.

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:08.920
Excuse me, game.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:12.920
I know for a fact I flew over that.

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.920
Would you like to register me flying through this?

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.920
No? Oh, okay.

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.920
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:24.920
Woman moment.

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.920
Okay, there we go.

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:28.920
There we go, you got it in the end.

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:30.920
Whee! I'm sure this is

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:32.920
really beautiful cinematic.

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:34.920
Oh, we got it. Okay, but we're hitting that rock.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.920
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:38.920
Look, the camera angle isn't...

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:40.920
It's not that easy to freaking dive, dive!

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:42.920
Alright, then go up, go up, go up.

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.920
There we go.

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:46.920
But yes, Banshee

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.920
are a really good way to get around these maps.

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.920
Whoa, whoa, easy, easy, easy.

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:52.920
And we are back to the start

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:54.920
where we started.

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.920
Look at us going.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.920
Isn't that beautiful?

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.920
Okay, I am going to say

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:02.920
before we start this next quest

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:04.920
there is a

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.920
voice line that repeats consistently

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.920
through this mission. I will try to get through as fast

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:10.920
as possible. It is so annoying.

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:12.920
It is so annoying.

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.920
Genuinely so annoying.

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:16.920
Horrifically annoying.

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.920
Unless this isn't

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:20.920
the mission.

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:26.920
Don't say that.

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:36.920
Maybe this isn't the mission I thought it was.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:44.920
Audio bug is the worst.

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:46.920
Is that Ubisoft game? It has to be.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:50.920
The animals slowly regretting letting you

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:52.920
drive them, honestly. Okay, no, it's after

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:54.920
this mission. They are really annoying when it pops up.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:56.920
What did we unlock?

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:58.920
A crossbow

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.920
and some sort of ability.

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:02.920
Hold on.

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:04.920
How do I open that?

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.920
Skills?

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:08.920
Kinetic Dash, Ewa's Breath

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.920
Titan Bash I don't really use.

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.920
We could maybe replace it

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.920
with

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.920
Calls of Hyperwolf to your side.

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.920
It will fight for you for a short time.

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:20.920
That is pretty cool.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.920
Death by Bees.

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:24.920
What the heck am I supposed to do?

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.920
I completely forgot.

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:28.920
We are going to raid Ikran.

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:30.920
Can I go on you?

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.920
Okay.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.920
Oh, he is going forward.

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:36.920
I never really...

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:38.920
Breath!

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:42.920
I see you after work.

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:46.920
Thank you, Tiny Spiny.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.920
I appreciate the tip.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:50.920
I did look it up.

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:52.920
I said the game takes around 7 hours

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.920
to complete. If we come back and do section stuff...

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.920
Wait, where am I?

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.920
I'll land.

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.920
I think I'll land up here.

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:02.920
It looks like I'm definitely to land to keep

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.920
Ikran safe up here.

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.920
You stay there, buddy.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:08.920
You be nice and safe.

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.920
Have a good day at work. Thanks for hanging.

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.920
I appreciate it. I appreciate the tip.

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:14.920
Support it.

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:16.920
I'm not to say donations because it's not a donation.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.920
Actually, I don't know

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.920
if I'm supposed to update the girls

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:22.920
as things to be like...

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:24.920
You know how you're supposed to put

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:26.920
a disclaimer on the freaking thing

01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:28.920
in case someone does a charge back?

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:30.920
Right.

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.920
I'm 99% sure these guys

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.920
just keep respawning.

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:36.920
So I'm actually not

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:38.920
to fuss...

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:40.920
Do you mind? Thank you.

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:42.920
I'm not to fuss

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.920
for completely clearing up this section.

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:48.920
Uh...

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:50.920
Am I to beat it up?

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:52.920
Oh, it's a bomb!

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:54.920
It's a bomb!

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:56.920
Okay, there we go. Let's go up.

01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:58.920
Is that about to blow up right next to me?

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:00.920
Oh, I didn't...

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:02.920
Kill guys don't look at explosions.

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:04.920
You know the drill, okay?

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:06.920
Kill guys don't look at explosions.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.920
Wait, you mean stream elements

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.920
is intact?

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:12.920
If someone does

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.920
a disclaimer for charge back

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:16.920
I'll probably edit the motor then.

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.920
Or when a girl...

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:20.920
I don't know, I get tired.

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:22.920
Oh, I have a fantastic

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:24.920
update for

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:26.920
scripts. Oh my goodness.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.920
So the script manager

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:30.920
now has access

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:32.920
and is taking over

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.920
and look

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.920
so everyone has

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:38.920
a four-part series coming out

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:40.920
like a story that kind of progresses.

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.920
Um...

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:44.920
Shebe's four-part series

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:46.920
is currently being written right now.

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:48.920
I'm not trying to say anything

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.920
but good luck trying to hold it together

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.920
when she performs that script

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.920
because

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.920
wow, I was blown away.

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.920
I'm like, there's definitely

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:00.920
something to be said about

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:02.920
a guy writing a script versus what I could write

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:04.920
because I just...

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:06.920
I like challenging myself

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.920
and in general I know what

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.920
overall you'd like us

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.920
to say type thing

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:14.920
but I have to admit, I was like

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:16.920
oh my god, there's not gonna be

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.920
any...anyone left in the

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:20.920
sack after that one.

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.920
And that was part one I read. I didn't even read

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.920
the finalized series of it.

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.920
Azur's one is being

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:28.920
worked on next.

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:30.920
Um...Oh my god!

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:32.920
Sorry!

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:34.920
I wasn't paying attention to how many

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:36.920
bad guys are there. Right, we're gonna watch the

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:38.920
explosion this time because we can.

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:40.920
What's the explosion look like?

01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:42.920
Okay, it was just kind of out of control.

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.920
Oh no, the terror does go down! Okay, I like it.

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:46.920
I wonder if we can get some

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:48.920
XP for destroying this.

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.920
Ow! Okay, we can

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:52.920
get XP for doing that.

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.920
I think? Why did...

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:56.920
Uh, Azur's

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.920
story...

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:00.920
I don't know if I should ruin what the story is.

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:02.920
Like, I don't want to like

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:04.920
tell stuff that's kind of like exciting for

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.920
girls.

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:08.920
But, like, I like

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:10.920
the four-part series ideas. Like,

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:12.920
Emmys one, I really like.

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:14.920
No, don't spoil it. Okay, I won't spoil it.

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.920
Um...Oh, there's a home

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.920
tree right there, actually. I don't know if I should

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:20.920
grab it then. Actually, no, I have

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.920
access to the Ikran to fly

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.920
around the map so it's not gonna be that big of

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:26.920
a deal of us coming back.

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.920
Newbie would begin

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.920
a work is a lot, so I

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.920
was good job as well. Yes, I like...So

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:34.920
now that, like, the scripts are no longer my problem,

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:36.920
I get to

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.920
focus on making the girl short,

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:40.920
so Mercy came out with a short and she

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.920
was like, do you...Do you think

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:44.920
I should have been blonde senpai and showed, like, behind the scenes artwork?

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:46.920
I'm gonna get everyone

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:48.920
to do that to show their concept art.

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.920
Like, me as well, actually, I need to write the

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.920
scripts. And, like, I get

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:54.920
to work on that kind of fun stuff

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.920
instead of kind of, like,

01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:58.920
being stretched too far.

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:00.920
Like...

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:02.920
It's too easy. It's too easy.

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:04.920
I'm not even gonna say it's that easy.

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.920
Um...

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.920
You can go as well, because you were shooting

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.920
my Ikran. You're not supposed to

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:12.920
shoot my Ikran.

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:14.920
Um...

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:16.920
I'm literally...Spoilershine is always the beginning for...

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.920
Literally, I...

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:20.920
I get so excited about everything that's planned

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:22.920
behind the scenes, that I'm like, oh,

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:24.920
I don't want to ruin it for the girls.

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:26.920
Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:28.920
wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.920
sorry, sorry. I'm too busy rambling.

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:32.920
I'm not even actually focusing on the dang game play.

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:34.920
Stop!

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.920
Okay, legit.

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.920
Wait! Oh, no!

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.920
We don't one-shot them anymore. They've gotten too

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.920
strong now. That's the problem.

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:44.920
If you don't, like, um...

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.920
Farm XP,

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.920
you will fall behind.

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:52.920
Concept art was great to see.

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:54.920
Yes, so I get to, like, kind of do that fun

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.920
behind-the-scenes script stuff, like,

01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:58.920
shorts for the girls.

01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.920
Um...

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.920
Also,

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.920
super gracious thank you

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.920
to everyone who

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.920
is using YouTube clip

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:10.920
feature for the girls.

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.920
If you didn't know,

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:14.920
if I go on their stream, I can see

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:16.920
who and what has been clipped.

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:18.920
I just want to say,

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:20.920
there's actually quite a few people

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:22.920
who are clipping my burps at the moment.

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:24.920
I might unironically make a

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.920
15-minute burp compilation, just for the heck

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:28.920
of it, and call it, like, strong burps for

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:30.920
14 minutes and 53 seconds.

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:32.920
Just for the heck of it,

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.920
because it seems to be

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:36.920
something a few

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.920
gentlemen seem to enjoy, and, you know, I'm not

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:40.920
here to ruin anyone's day.

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.920
But yes, please do consider

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.920
clipping. We have a really funny

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:46.920
short of Icy

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:48.920
coming soon.

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:50.920
Our second clipper

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.920
we're kind of testing them out.

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:54.920
I don't have a problem, because they've already had

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:56.920
extensive clip history, but

01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:58.920
they're busy at the moment, so the clips are

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:00.920
a wee bit slow to be produced.

01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:02.920
But we're getting there, we're getting there, so

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:04.920
thank you to anyone who uses YouTube clip feature

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:06.920
to help out.

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:08.920
A short of Icy doing what?

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:10.920
So it's already happened, so it's not a

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.920
spoiler.

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.920
But Icy, basically, when

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:16.920
in her adorable voice,

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:18.920
I'm not very smart,

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.920
and then she went, thank you so

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:22.920
much, Mike, honey

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.920
for donating to me

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:26.920
in her adorable frickin accent.

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:28.920
And I'm like, Icy,

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:30.920
Icicle, should I

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.920
have taught you that? Should I have said to

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:34.920
you

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.920
what that means?

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.920
So we're going to, we're going to get

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:40.920
turned into a clip, and I'll be sure on her

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.920
thing.

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:44.920
But her accent is so frickin adorable. Okay, I'm

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:46.920
going to bed. Rest well, see you in the

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.920
morning when you wake up.

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:50.920
I love seeing that. I love seeing that

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.920
whenever you guys are like, okay, I need to go

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:54.920
to work or I need to go to sleep. I'll see you

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:56.920
in the morning, see you in the morning. Oh yeah,

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:58.920
I'll see you after work, yeah, yeah. Oh, you

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.920
need to go out and do some errands, I'll see

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:02.920
you after that, I'll still be on. Right, this

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:04.920
is the scene.

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:06.920
The quote is, Raider, you have got to

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.920
get to higher ground. It will be repeated

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:10.920
a ridiculous amount

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.920
of times.

01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:14.920
Yep, I remember the quote, I've not even

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:16.920
played this game in many a year, Raider,

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.920
you have got to get to higher grounds, it

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:20.920
will repeat, and I'm like, did no one play

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:22.920
test this? Did no one

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:24.920
see what an issue this is?

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.920
Because I've gone the wrong way.

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.920
I've gone the wrong way.

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:30.920
I'm gonna part myself.

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.920
Right, let's hurry this up

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.920
through this section.

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.920
Ah! Oh my god, imagine

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.920
that coming out, yeah, I would actually

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.920
be so terrified. Shawnee,

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.920
you've got to get to higher ground, honestly!

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:44.920
Get that

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.920
done. Get that

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:48.920
done.

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:50.920
Right, we destroy one

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:52.920
way.

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.920
Oh, I love it. Love it.

01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.920
Special, what's right? Oh no,

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.920
what's my special?

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:04.920
I don't know what button the special

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:06.920
is though. Yes, we spawn at checkpoint.

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:08.920
It's putting, it's giving me keyboard

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:10.920
input, but I'm playing mouse in control,

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:12.920
like I don't know if you can hear my analog stick.

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:14.920
Let's give that another try.

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:16.920
That was a bit daft.

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.920
I do apologize

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:20.920
for that MLG game. I'm going the wrong way

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:22.920
again.

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.920
I can't all be good

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:26.920
at video games.

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:28.920
Literally, wherever

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.920
nine-year-old me is inside my head right

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.920
now, can you come

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:34.920
and help us out here? Because this is getting

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.920
very good. This is getting embarrassing.

01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:38.920
Right, I'm going

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:40.920
to click the analog sticks this time

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.920
to see if that's what the special

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:44.920
is instead.

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:46.920
Right, special, analog,

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:48.920
nope, that's,

01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:50.920
nope, that's scan.

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:52.920
What would

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:54.920
R be?

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:56.920
You know what, I'm just going to hit R on my keyboard.

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:04.920
No!

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.920
Don't throw me, it's so...

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:08.920
Wait, why is this not breaking?

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:10.920
Is there a health bar? Oh, there is!

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:12.920
Is it glitched

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:14.920
out?

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:16.920
I can see that health bar, that little green.

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:18.920
What's going on?

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:22.920
Thank you for the tip, analog.

01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:24.920
Wait, I think it's glitched out.

01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:26.920
This is an old game, hold on.

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:28.920
Let me do this.

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.920
I'll do it with a bigger one.

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:32.920
Uh...

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:34.920
Game?

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:36.920
Game, you're showing your time.

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:38.920
I've never actually had it glitched out

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.920
here before.

01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:50.920
Right.

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:52.920
I had to press F on the keyboard.

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:54.920
I don't know what button I was supposed to press

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:56.920
on the freaking...

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:58.920
I'm sorry, oh, it keeps saying it.

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:00.920
Literally, right where you've got to get to

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:02.920
higher ground.

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:04.920
I literally F in the chat, that's...

01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:06.920
Oh!

01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:08.920
Oh, you're getting worked, mate.

01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.920
Oh, then you fall now.

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:16.920
Oh, he's hiding in the freaking bushes.

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.920
Right, healing up, healing up, healing up.

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:20.920
Don't worry, don't worry.

01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:22.920
Actually, I think these are much faster.

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:24.920
Yeah, these are one shot.

01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:26.920
The dual wield is one shot,

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.920
but the long stick isn't one shot.

01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:32.920
What does that mean?

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:34.920
Right, okay,

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:36.920
we're just going to press the keyboard.

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.920
We're literally just switching between the keyboard

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:40.920
and the ticket thing. I don't know what I'm supposed to press.

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.920
Get worked for free, must be nice.

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:46.920
Steady on, are you?

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:48.920
Should we watch her by any chance?

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:52.920
Right, down we go.

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:54.920
I don't know.

01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:56.920
Are you squinting me right now?

01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:58.920
Beijingle!

01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:00.920
Stop!

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:02.920
No, I'm getting trolled.

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:04.920
Thank you for the tip.

01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:06.920
He repeats it so much,

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:08.920
but he's not doing it right now.

01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:10.920
I wonder because...

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:12.920
I don't know why he's not repeating it.

01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:14.920
But I kid you not,

01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:16.920
he constantly repeats,

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:18.920
you have got to get to higher ground.

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.920
You have got to get to higher ground.

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:22.920
Over and over and over and over.

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:24.920
But, I think we're actually

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:26.920
being given...

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.920
Oh, objective control.

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:30.920
The classic three

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:32.920
and done in video games.

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:34.920
If aint broke, don't fix it.

01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:36.920
Do this thing three times

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:38.920
and you win.

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:40.920
Delicious.

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:42.920
Delicious, delicious, delicious.

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.920
Love it.

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:46.920
I love it when game devs get the memory.

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:50.920
Oh my god, I'm inside that!

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.920
I'm inside it! Leave a load!

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:54.920
No!

01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:58.920
Oh no.

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:00.920
I'm a...

01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:02.920
Oh, that's not good.

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:04.920
I'm having a seizure.

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:10.920
Home tree!

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:12.920
Wait a minute.

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.920
I think I might have died

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:16.920
and now I'm at home tree

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.920
and I'm about to be spiritually be a Navi.

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:20.920
I'm physically about to be

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:22.920
100% Navi

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.920
if I remember correctly.

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:30.920
Oh yeah, that's right.

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:32.920
Oh, I can feel myself connecting

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.920
with nature.

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:38.920
Ah, she...

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.920
Oh...

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:52.920
I find this so cool.

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:54.920
Are you kidding me right now?

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.920
Heck yeah, speak for the trees.

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:02.920
Thank you, Tim Show.

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:04.920
For the tip. I can never say that right.

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:06.920
Shuttle.

01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:12.920
Eywa just resurrected me

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:14.920
and Eywa's word is truth.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.920
So I will not be taking any

01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:18.920
contesting points that I'm no

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:20.920
a Navi anymore.

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:24.920
Actually, I really

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:26.920
enjoyed the second Avatar movie

01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:28.920
because what's her name?

01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:30.920
The one that is

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:32.920
Sigourney Weaver as a child?

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:34.920
I really like her plot line.

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:38.920
Eywa, that she's like

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:40.920
she can commune with Eywa.

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:42.920
I really like her.

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:44.920
Avatar Stoney has

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:46.920
an arrow under her hair.

01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:52.920
There's a second Avatar movie?

01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:54.920
Yeah, it's called We of the Water.

01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:58.920
Did you not get advertised

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.920
on anything?

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:04.920
There's a second Avatar movie.

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.920
It's out right now.

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:08.920
I may have just spoiled it for you.

01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:10.920
I apologize.

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:12.920
Eat.

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:14.920
If I was home tree,

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:16.920
I would tell Stoney to

01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:18.920
If I was the home tree,

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:20.920
I would tell Stoney to

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:22.920
I don't know what he want.

01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:24.920
What are you on about?

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:28.920
What are you on about?

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:30.920
This is a spiritual location.

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:32.920
You can't

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.920
loot the home tree.

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:36.920
Okay, I say that as if

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.920
there is an agenda concept right now

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.920
that may or may not have

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:42.920
have some non-influenced playing.

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:46.920
You cannot

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:48.920
do any activated mission things.

01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:50.920
Oh, it's the guy.

01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:54.920
Nothing but more than pure

01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:56.920
agenda.

01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:00.920
My new abandoned name.

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.920
Advertising for the second movie was

01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:06.920
a booze ball.

01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:08.920
It still did really well, did it not?

01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:10.920
If I'm not mistaken.

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:12.920
Are you underestimating the power?

01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:18.920
You acting like the tree?

01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:20.920
Well, it's the Holy Spirit

01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:22.920
of Navi.

01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:24.920
Okay, we are going to

01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:26.920
Swatulu.

01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:28.920
Anyone else

01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:30.920
visited Swatulu?

01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:32.920
Maybe on spring break you went to Swatulu?

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:34.920
Yeah, they are absolutely wrecking

01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:36.920
this place.

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:38.920
This is not

01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:40.920
this area

01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:42.920
is definitely getting absolutely wrecked.

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.920
I just remembered what happens

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:48.920
in this area. I'm like night and impotenture.

01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:54.920
Very good location because something very

01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:56.920
cool happens.

01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:58.920
Storm and Scythe.

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.920
No, actually I think it's a later level.

01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:06.920
You know that?

01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:08.920
Anyway, let's go.

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:10.920
The first movie itself

01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:12.920
was already advertised enough for the second

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:14.920
that's probably what they said.

01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:16.920
That was

01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:18.920
really outrageous

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.920
writer. I'm going to be honest.

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:22.920
Say no hablo

01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:24.920
to a Navi.

01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:26.920
I don't know, that felt a bit weird

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:28.920
to me. I don't think we should let that one slide.

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:30.920
That was

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.920
that was motivated.

01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:34.920
That was bizarre.

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:36.920
And if you're

01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:38.920
literally fully Navi, you're not going to put

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:40.920
that on the screen.

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:42.920
And if you're

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:44.920
literally fully Navi, you're not going to put

01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:46.920
effort into speaking Navi.

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:48.920
We're going to unlock the home vision tree.

01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:50.920
What the heck is that?

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.920
Oh, it's a tree of vision. Oh, it's a sector

01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:56.920
challenge. Okay.

01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:58.920
Am I crazy

01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.920
or was there a horse I could ride back

01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:02.920
here?

01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:04.920
Thank you, Child Me,

01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:06.920
for remembering.

01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:08.920
Oh my god, I'm actually so smart.

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:10.920
You're just menacingly

01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:12.920
guarding this horse. Can I just take it?

01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:14.920
Thanks mate. Appreciate it.

01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:16.920
Hey,

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:18.920
hablo español

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:20.920
sí, señorita.

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:22.920
Te amo.

01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:24.920
¿Qué pasa?

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:26.920
¿Dónde

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:28.920
está la biblioteca?

01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:30.920
There are

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:32.920
RDA, but the beautiful thing

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.920
about these parts of the map

01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:36.920
you can ignore it.

01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:38.920
You can just zoom ahead.

01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:40.920
This is one of those games where

01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:42.920
if you want to take your time and explore it

01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:44.920
you most certainly can, but if you just

01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:46.920
want to be like, right, I want to do the objective

01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:48.920
meee, I don't want to leave the horse

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:50.920
in the middle here. What am I doing here?

01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:52.920
Oh no, I don't want my horse to

01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:54.920
wait, investigate. Oh, I'm only to do a

01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:56.920
drive-by? Oh, I can do a drive-by

01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:58.920
shooting alright, don't mind me.

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.920
Oh, let's go.

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:04.920
Right, I don't think you can shoot

01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:06.920
well on horseback. Sorry,

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:08.920
dire horse, it's called dire horse.

01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:10.920
But yes, I don't mind

01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:12.920
doing a drive-by.

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:14.920
Right, left or right,

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:16.920
both are terrible.

01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:18.920
This one's a dead end, so do the

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:20.920
dead end first and then come back for the open one

01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:22.920
because it's likely

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:24.920
that the open will be like the next

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:26.920
progression.

01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:28.920
Oh, my wee horse is getting

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:30.920
injured.

01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:32.920
Shattered village, yeah,

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:34.920
looks absolutely desolate.

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:36.920
Okay, I think the game's

01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:38.920
putting horses around the map in case

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:40.920
we do end up losing.

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:42.920
Can you feel like Sample's on horseback? You cannot.

01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:44.920
Flexing them,

01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:46.920
rolling arse.

01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:48.920
What do you mean you cannot roll your arse?

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:50.920
Can you not

01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:52.920
iterate what you wish to

01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:54.920
rock on?

01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:56.920
I just started shoving arse and words that

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.920
don't even have it. Oh, my poor horse.

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:00.920
Oh, it's a mech, it's a mech, it's a mech,

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:02.920
oh, the horse is going to perish.

01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:04.920
Oh, no, the horse is perishing this game.

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:06.920
I don't like it here.

01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:08.920
Let's get out of this place.

01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:12.920
Is this the first

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:14.920
game? It is. This is not the new game

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:16.920
that came out. This is the

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:18.920
Archaic 2009

01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:20.920
game.

01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:24.920
Lunguri is not here.

01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:26.920
Where is Lunguri?

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:28.920
Lunguri, where are you, mate?

01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:30.920
I need to find Lunguri.

01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:34.920
Any Lunguri fans?

01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:36.920
I'm a Lunguri fan.

01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:38.920
Oh, the horse is getting

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.920
in a loop.

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.920
With Unipee.

01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:48.920
That's right, Riflin.

01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:50.920
Unipee.

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:52.920
Oh, Unipee is a person.

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:56.920
Oh, what did we unlock?

01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:58.920
Let's see.

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:00.920
The Onato Pack.

01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:02.920
What is that?

01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:04.920
That looks like shards from the sky.

01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:06.920
That looked cool.

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:08.920
I've not actually summoned a horse.

01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:10.920
What was that, birds from the sky?

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:12.920
Call on Pandora to help strike.

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:14.920
Oh, my god.

01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:16.920
Hold on, what does it look like?

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:22.920
Okay, okay, okay, little baby.

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:24.920
Little baby clangs.

01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:26.920
Okay, great.

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:28.920
We can go through here.

01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:30.920
Oh!

01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.920
I'm getting shot at.

01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:34.920
Or is he shooting at an NPC?

01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:36.920
I don't know. Hello, do you need assistance?

01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.920
She just expired.

01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:44.920
I don't know. I don't even speak Navi.

01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:46.920
I don't even know what her last words were.

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:48.920
Oh, my god.

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:50.920
Her family is going to be like, what were her last words?

01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:52.920
And I'm like, I'm so sorry, mate.

01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:54.920
Sky people.

01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:56.920
You're going to have to forgive me,

01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:58.920
but is there an enemy there?

01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:00.920
No, that's a boss.

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:02.920
Where's the enemy?

01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:04.920
That's actually really embarrassing.

01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:06.920
Yeah, we don't know her last words

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:08.920
because I'm a dumb dumb.

01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:10.920
We're playing that. Hello, are you okay?

01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:12.920
Are you squiddin' me right now?

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:14.920
Brian!

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:16.920
True!

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:26.920
Okay, Iron Reaper, thank you for the tip.

01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:28.920
I'll admit, true.

01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:30.920
However, I present to you

01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:32.920
Sigourney Weaver

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:34.920
Second Storyline.

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:36.920
And that's fine with me.

01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:38.920
I like that she's connected to Pandora

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:40.920
and control Pandora, okay?

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:42.920
To Awa, and Awa grants her those abilities.

01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:46.920
I don't think she's doing well.

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:48.920
Are you going to expire after we finish

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:50.920
talking because

01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.920
I can't translate

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:54.920
your last words

01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:56.920
to tell your

01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:58.920
to tell your family.

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:04.920
Oh!

01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:06.920
Maybe you should expire

01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:08.920
because that's actually really sweet.

01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:12.920
That's really rude. Please don't do that.

01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:14.920
Please don't do that.

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:16.920
Sorry one.

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:18.920
Please don't.

01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:26.920
I need to

01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:28.920
claim

01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:30.920
Please bearish.

01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:32.920
Oh, my bow and arrow is not

01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:34.920
strong anymore whatsoever.

01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:36.920
I used to one-shot these guys.

01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:38.920
It's now costing

01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:40.920
to ammo.

01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:44.920
Right.

01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:46.920
So what we have to do

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:48.920
is just climb up these and then jump aboard

01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:50.920
when it comes background

01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:52.920
and then we destroy its receiving

01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.920
signal thing, which completely

01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:58.920
Okay, yeah.

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.920
Do you remember when we played Elden Ring

01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:02.920
and there was that chariot thing

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:04.920
and you had to drop down on top of it?

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:06.920
Basically that.

01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:08.920
We just need to

01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:10.920
slowly wait for it to turn.

01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:12.920
Yep. Okay.

01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:14.920
And then

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:16.920
when we get close enough

01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.920
we just jump down.

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:22.920
Wait, can I not just

01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:24.920
can I not shoot that with bow and arrow?

01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:28.920
I feel like

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:30.920
with their height difference I could probably

01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:32.920
bow and arrow that. Hmm.

01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:38.920
Nope.

01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:40.920
I believe Elden Ring stole that idea.

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:42.920
Literally.

01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:46.920
Right.

01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:48.920
I think that's just showing

01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:50.920
I need to go up on this one.

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:52.920
I can see it on the minimap that I'm covering up

01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:54.920
with my big hair but the minimap

01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:56.920
I wish I could put the minimap in the other corner.

01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:58.920
You know what?

01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:00.920
I'm always covering up the minimap when I play games.

01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:02.920
Hopefully it doesn't bother you guys.

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:04.920
I assume it's coming around this corner

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:06.920
very slowly.

01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:08.920
Let's try to shoot out.

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:12.920
Are you coming?

01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:14.920
Hello?

01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:16.920
Is it stuck?

01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:18.920
Am I out of its distance to move?

01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:20.920
Right, you. I can hear you shooting.

01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:22.920
Knock it off.

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:24.920
Stop moving.

01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:26.920
Oh look the picture plant.

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:28.920
Look it's sending flies out to hurt him.

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:30.920
Death by flies.

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:32.920
Death by flies. Oh he's in.

01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:34.920
Did he come? I didn't know they could use.

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.920
Come back. You need to perish by flies

01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:38.920
or by bow and arrow. Pick.

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:42.920
Fine. Okay, I'm out of the distance.

01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:44.920
Right, is this not?

01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:48.920
Is it stuck?

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:50.920
Why am I going to be stuck?

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:52.920
Ugh, fine.

01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:54.920
I think we're maybe too early.

01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:56.920
Watch it start moving

01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:58.920
when I come around this corner.

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:00.920
Yeah, I was kind of

01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:02.920
joking. I was actually

01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:04.920
joking. But it seriously

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:06.920
did it. I knew that. Where's the

01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:08.920
freaking vein? Where's the vein?

01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:10.920
Please

01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:12.920
from the vine

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:16.920
falling so slowly

01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:18.920
like tight.

01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:20.920
Are you not moving again

01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:22.920
because I'm out of your render distance?

01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:26.920
I am being pranked.

01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:28.920
I am being pranked.

01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:30.920
Wait, did it move?

01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:34.920
Wait, that is it there.

01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:36.920
That's it right there.

01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:38.920
The render distance is broke.

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:42.920
Bro, it's going to start moving.

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:44.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:46.920
Let me get up the dang thing.

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:52.920
Oh, that's literally the only song

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:54.920
I know of by heart.

01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:56.920
It's actually really sad.

01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:58.920
There is

01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:00.920
an enemy called Avatar the Last

01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:02.920
Airbender

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:04.920
and Uncle Iroh is an absolute

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:06.920
beloved character

01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:08.920
and he sang a really moving

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:10.920
song. It's literally the only

01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:12.920
song I know off the top of my head.

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:14.920
But it's like beautiful

01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:16.920
sad, not like

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:18.920
hopefully not too sad, sad, you know?

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:22.920
I need to not bring that song up

01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:24.920
anywhere close to what I'm making here.

01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:26.920
We can not allow it for spoilers.

01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:28.920
Has enemy not seen it?

01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:30.920
Please stop it. I'm going to cry.

01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:32.920
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:34.920
I didn't realize it was bad guys here.

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:36.920
Take this

01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:38.920
and this. Why am I taking

01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:40.920
so much damage?

01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:42.920
I don't know.

01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:44.920
Have I unlocked a new outfit?

01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:46.920
No, I haven't.

01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:48.920
Wait, do you see that stat increase though?

01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:50.920
So as we unlock new outfits, it's going to go up so much.

01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:52.920
You mean you don't...

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.920
I don't know Secret Tunnel off my heart.

01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:56.920
Secret Tunnel, what am I supposed to do?

01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:00.920
I'm supposed to do something. Hold on.

01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:02.920
I see the blossoms.

01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:06.920
Two lovers

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:08.920
forbidden from one another.

01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:12.920
There's a mountain

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:14.920
in the way.

01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:24.920
And I kind of forget

01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:26.920
how this next part goes.

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:28.920
Secret Tunnel

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:30.920
Brian, I'm singing.

01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:36.920
Amy's planning on doing it.

01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:38.920
So she should definitely support Emure's

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:40.920
when she does that. Definitely.

01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:42.920
Thank you for the tip, Nero.

01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:50.920
I kind of forgot how this next part goes.

01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:52.920
Can you guys put the lyrics

01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.920
in chat and then I'll sing it to you?

01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:58.920
Shawnee, why have all the Scottish people

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:00.920
met? Also nice.

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:02.920
Why are Scottish people nice?

01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:04.920
I don't know.

01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:06.920
We're just vibing.

01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:08.920
Glasgow's been rated one of the nicest.

01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:10.920
Oh, we've got to level up.

01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:12.920
We've got to level up in our healing and our sprint.

01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:14.920
So are we eating faster?

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.920
Oh, wow.

01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:18.920
Okay, that was a pretty decent distance.

01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:20.920
Are you actually a blue guy in this game?

01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:22.920
Or are you a skin walker like the movie?

01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:24.920
We have...

01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:26.920
Our human body has died.

01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:28.920
It got annihilated

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:30.920
via missiles.

01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:32.920
So yeah, we're like...

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.920
We're Navi now. We're just trying to get

01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:36.920
accepted by the Navi and to reverse

01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:38.920
the horrific effects

01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:40.920
that I'm actually

01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:42.920
not

01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:44.920
very skilled at this bit.

01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:46.920
Oh, jeez, Louise!

01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:50.920
Oh my God, they like ate my health up

01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:52.920
so quickly. So this is what I mean

01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:54.920
by you get a second chance.

01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:56.920
I now have four second chances.

01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:58.920
Oh my goodness.

01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:00.920
Get... Right.

01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:02.920
He's perished.

01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.920
Oh my gosh, that was...

01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:06.920
Right, he's off of it.

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:10.920
I don't know if I need to like

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:12.920
unironically XP grind

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:14.920
or something.

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:16.920
I feel like I die.

01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:18.920
I think I'm...

01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:20.920
Okay, we're...

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:22.920
We're out of...

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:24.920
We're out of... Oh my gosh.

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:26.920
I don't remember...

01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:28.920
I don't remember the game being so hard.

01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:30.920
You know that?

01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:32.920
I'm just getting out of here like,

01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:34.920
bro, I'm out. You don't need to

01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:36.920
worry about me. I'm gone. I'm in and out

01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:38.920
like a flash.

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:40.920
Call me Usain Bolt. I'm gone.

01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:42.920
Ten seconds for that.

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:44.920
I'm like, you know...

01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.920
No, not leaves from the vine. The other one.

01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:48.920
The happier one. The two lovers one.

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:50.920
Not leaves from the vine. There we go.

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:52.920
That's a sad one.

01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:54.920
Scots are nice until you...

01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:56.920
Oh, Tia's off, honestly.

01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:02.920
Oh my bad. Yeah, yeah.

01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:04.920
I'm trying not to be too...

01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:06.920
We don't want to be sad up in here.

01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:08.920
Good times. Good vibes.

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:18.920
I have no idea what it is.

01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:20.920
Strawny, you just channeled some

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:22.920
intense Dark Souls energy by spam-rolling away

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:24.920
from the attackers, honestly, though.

01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:26.920
I should probably pick up cell samples

01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:28.920
because I ended up using two revives

01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:30.920
for that.

01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:32.920
I definitely need an armor upgrade

01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:34.920
to Sumtium because...

01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:36.920
Oof.

01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:38.920
Okay, ready?

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.920
And a burn

01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:50.920
and devades them

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:52.920
apart.

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:54.920
The build

01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:56.920
of paths to be

01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:58.920
together.

01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:00.920
And I kind of forgot how the rest

01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:02.920
of it goes, but

01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:04.920
Secret Tunnel!

01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:06.920
Secret Tunnel!

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:10.920
It's such a good song.

01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:14.920
There we go.

01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:16.920
It's such a good song for you.

01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:18.920
A little karaoke

01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:20.920
before the actual karaoke stream is planned.

01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:22.920
Have a look at that.

01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:26.920
I've got to stop.

01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:28.920
That'll get stuck

01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:30.920
in my head for months.

01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:32.920
Oh, do you want the Scottish version of it?

01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:34.920
So it's extra cursed?

01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:36.920
Wait, someone refit the lyrics in again

01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:38.920
and I'll do the Scottish version for you

01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:40.920
because I'm just so kind like that.

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:42.920
Wah! Okay.

01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:44.920
So the close combat is the insta...

01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:46.920
I said the insta die.

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:48.920
Thank you.

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:50.920
Right, Scottish version.

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:54.920
If someone puts the lyrics in chat for me

01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:56.920
just so I can...

01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:58.920
My brain's a little slow.

01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:00.920
Two lovers

01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:02.920
forbidden from one another

01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:04.920
award

01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:06.920
devades their people

01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:08.920
for people

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:12.920
Brian!

01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:14.920
You interrupted my singing, Brian.

01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:16.920
I'm getting absolutely...

01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:18.920
Alright. Oh, sugar.

01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:20.920
Thank you for the tip, Rick.

01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:22.920
Okay, I'm getting too distracted.

01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:30.920
Thank you for tipping that.

01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:32.920
You didn't have to tip that.

01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:34.920
But thank you, I do appreciate it anyway.

01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:36.920
Scottish version.

01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:38.920
Wait, should I do really easily, Scots?

01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:40.920
Two lovers

01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:42.920
forbidden from one another

01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:44.920
award

01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:46.920
devades their people

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:50.920
and a mountain

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:52.920
devades them apart

01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:56.920
and built a path

01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:58.920
a be

01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:00.920
together

01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:02.920
Yeah, and I forget who the next couple of lines go.

01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:04.920
But then it goes

01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:06.920
secret tunnel

01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:08.920
secret tunnel

01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:12.920
through the mountain

01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:16.920
secret secret secret secret tunnel

01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:20.920
I think I need to go and visit for this next section.

01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:24.920
Anyway, that's the Scots rendition.

01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:26.920
You're welcome for that on the house.

01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:28.920
Didn't even have to pick. Why?

01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:30.920
Bone arrow, why?

01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:32.920
I'll go invisible

01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:34.920
if I'm going to end up perishing

01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:36.920
I think.

01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:38.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:40.920
Okay, these turrets on the wall

01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:42.920
are my biggest enemies.

01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:44.920
Got a lot of enemies and it's the turrets on the wall.

01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:46.920
Not the actual things.

01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:48.920
Strona, just had any idea for your outfit.

01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:50.920
What about a version

01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:52.920
with all of your modesty

01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:54.920
plasters are replaced by nicotine patches?

01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:56.920
Honestly?

01:46:56.920 --> 01:46:58.920
What is going on?

01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:00.920
I don't

01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:02.920
Sorry, I really don't remember this section

01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:04.920
so I don't know what I'm up against

01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:06.920
but I'm just going to take it slow

01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:08.920
and I'm not wrong with taking it a bit slow

01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:10.920
I'm just a bit

01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:12.920
I can see something over there

01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:14.920
Oh, he's destroying the car.

01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:16.920
See empty mechas

01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:18.920
What's that up there?

01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:22.920
Can I destroy these for XP?

01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:24.920
Hold on.

01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:30.920
Oh, wow.

01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:32.920
Oh, I'm doing a task sector

01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:34.920
destroying empty mech.

01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:36.920
Oh, wow, they explode as well.

01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:38.920
That's actually really good to know that they explode.

01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:40.920
Okay, there we go. I press X to do that.

01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:42.920
Ultimate.

01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:44.920
Strona, just smoke.

01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:46.920
No, I just talked too long and my voice is fried.

01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:48.920
Do you need help with this?

01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:50.920
You want to gang violence this car?

01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:52.920
You're taking your sweet time.

01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:54.920
That's going to blow up, bro.

01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:56.920
That's going to blow up.

01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:58.920
Oh, it didn't hurt him though.

01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:00.920
Oh, I get a lot of XP for doing that.

01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:02.920
I don't know if we need to farm yet.

01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:04.920
If we get too weak, we'll farm.

01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:06.920
But at the moment, we are above the

01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:08.920
thingy.

01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:10.920
Watch out. I know.

01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:12.920
Watch out. She's destroying something.

01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:18.920
This looks very battle dome-esque

01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:20.920
but I don't recall.

01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:22.920
I just heard an Ikram.

01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:24.920
I think that was an Ikram.

01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:26.920
Is this the person we need to find?

01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:28.920
Because I don't think he's looking too good.

01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:30.920
Are you okay?

01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:32.920
Oh, he needs some milk.

01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:38.920
Right, I'm sorry. It was too obvious.

01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:40.920
That's how you get wrecked.

01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:44.920
Don't want to get hit that much,

01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:46.920
but this is literally the best I can do.

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:48.920
Okay, that special attack knocks him over.

01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:50.920
That's really good to know.

01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:56.920
Okay, that bought me time.

01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:02.920
That didn't damage me.

01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:04.920
That explosion didn't damage me.

01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:06.920
Okay, let's go.

01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:08.920
Okay, that wasn't that bad.

01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:10.920
I thought that was going to be like

01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:12.920
insane battle dome-esque type stuff,

01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:14.920
but we're safe.

01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:16.920
Stronny's Inc's Milky.

01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:18.920
Hold on a minute.

01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:20.920
Someone described my homemade

01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:22.920
yogurt as glippy.

01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:24.920
I have not forgiven you for such descriptions.

01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:26.920
Is there an enemy over here?

01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:30.920
Whoa!

01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:36.920
The frickin...

01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:40.920
Wait, how much do I have to redo?

01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:42.920
Because I was deep in that. Okay, I don't have to redo much.

01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:44.920
The plane took me away with it.

01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:48.920
Bumped away, man.

01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:50.920
Bumped away.

01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:52.920
As far as I'm aware, this game has infinite lives.

01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:56.920
I probably would never have finished it if I didn't,

01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:58.920
because, you know...

01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:02.920
Glippy!

01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:04.920
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:06.920
That is so cheating.

01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:08.920
They had pre-spondent.

01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:10.920
Go away.

01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:12.920
Go through that, because I can't shoot you.

01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:14.920
I'm going to have to be in viz to claim up this.

01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:16.920
Oh, my gosh.

01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:18.920
Where did... where did they go?

01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:20.920
Right, I need to...

01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:24.920
Oh, lovely.

01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:26.920
Okay, there we go.

01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:28.920
Yeah, I'm not one-shotting nothing.

01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:30.920
Yeah, I'm going to go up.

01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:32.920
Just so the screen isn't too red.

01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:36.920
There, jeez, Louise.

01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.920
Oh, I almost didn't make that.

01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:40.920
Can I destroy this? Oh, I can.

01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:42.920
Take that.

01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:44.920
I didn't get any XP for that, so...

01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:48.920
That's quite something, honestly.

01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:50.920
Oh, my Icaran's here!

01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:52.920
I thought my Icaran was going to come and get me.

01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:54.920
Okay, it's because it's exploding.

01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:56.920
My Icaran is coming to get me.

01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:58.920
Um...

01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:00.920
Right, okay, let's...

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:02.920
See what we're working...

01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:04.920
We're still not...

01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:06.920
Whoa, I don't like that.

01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:08.920
Oh!

01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:10.920
I messed up!

01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:12.920
I'm sorry, I even brought attention to my existence.

01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:14.920
Please, please, please!

01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:16.920
I'm just a Navi!

01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:18.920
I'm just a... I'm just a sweet innocent Navi.

01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:20.920
I'm just a Navi.

01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:22.920
I'm just a Navi.

01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:24.920
I'm just a Navi.

01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:26.920
I'm just a sweet innocent Navi.

01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:28.920
I'm sorry I tried to pick on you, Mr. Car.

01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:30.920
I'm sorry.

01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:32.920
My goodness, that Warthog is powerful.

01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:34.920
Oh, my goodness!

01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:38.920
It was just a little arrow.

01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:40.920
My gosh!

01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:42.920
And let me up!

01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:44.920
Literally, light them up!

01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:46.920
I want that thing out blasted out of the sky!

01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:50.920
Oh, my goodness.

01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:52.920
That was not good.

01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:54.920
You're standing up now, so you feel a bit better.

01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:56.920
Good.

01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:58.920
Oh, a great warrior.

01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:00.920
Oh, you were hating on me about 20 minutes ago.

01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:04.920
Don't think I... I didn't forget.

01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:06.920
You're a little hater.

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:08.920
Okay, goodbye!

01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:10.920
Oh, I'm called Dreamwalker now.

01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:12.920
I'm no longer a sky people.

01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:14.920
I'm a dreamer.

01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:16.920
Let me shoot an arrow at this armed vehicle.

01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:18.920
Look, I have some good ideas

01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:20.920
and I have some bad ideas.

01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:22.920
That was a bad idea.

01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:28.920
Oh, there's...

01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:30.920
What the heck is this?

01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:32.920
What did I do with that?

01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:34.920
Oh, we got an unlock.

01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:36.920
What did we get?

01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:38.920
A lookup hack.

01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:40.920
Invis for longer.

01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:42.920
Oh, we've got a bow and arrow upgrade

01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:44.920
and a weapon upgrade.

01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:46.920
Oh, look, her bow's changed.

01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:48.920
Look, it's a different design now.

01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:50.920
What am I supposed to do with these crystals?

01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:52.920
Excuse me.

01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:56.920
Am I supposed...

01:52:56.920 --> 01:52:58.920
Here we go.

01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:00.920
I guess I'm to follow the crystals

01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:02.920
because it's doing the little lights.

01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:04.920
Okay, it's to follow it.

01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:06.920
Oh, good job!

01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:08.920
I'm freaking...

01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:10.920
Okay, we're safe.

01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:12.920
My goodness.

01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:14.920
I don't know what I need in order to survive

01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:16.920
other than an armor upgrade,

01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:18.920
but warthogs are so unforgiving.

01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:20.920
I was a mecha as I've unlocked now.

01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:22.920
See, we're starting to get out of the tutorial

01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:24.920
where the game does not forgive.

01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:26.920
Like, the game will annihilate you

01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:28.920
if you don't, like, level up and stuff.

01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:30.920
Oh, my horse is getting really shot out there.

01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:32.920
I didn't like that.

01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:34.920
I didn't enjoy that.

01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:36.920
More enemies?

01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:38.920
It's impassable.

01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:42.920
Oh, for...

01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:44.920
No, Mr. Horsey!

01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:46.920
Please do not...

01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:48.920
Wait!

01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:50.920
Gang violence!

01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:52.920
Oh, my horse just perished

01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:54.920
but I saw him attack on the leaf.

01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:56.920
That's two games where the horse actually helps you.

01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:00.920
Okay, we're just going to have to take the risk

01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:02.920
on foot, sadly.

01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:06.920
Did they attack me if I'm Navi?

01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:08.920
I feel like...

01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:10.920
Oh, it's so beautiful!

01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:12.920
Oh!

01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:16.920
Yeah, I really don't want them to attack me.

01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:20.920
I'm definitely picking up the...

01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:28.920
Uh-huh.

01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:38.920
I was hoping they didn't attack.

01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:40.920
Oh, I've gone the wrong way.

01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:42.920
I'm getting too distracted.

01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:44.920
Oh, I don't want to hurt the whale blade.

01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:46.920
It just sucks.

01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:48.920
Wait a minute! What did she call me?

01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:50.920
Raider!

01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:52.920
I hardly even know her!

01:54:56.920 --> 01:54:58.920
Oh, you didn't like that one?

01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:00.920
I guess... Yeah, I guess I repeated it.

01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:02.920
I'm sorry.

01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:06.920
Yeah, okay, I won't recycle jokes.

01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:08.920
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:14.920
I can't see.

01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:18.920
Okay, I'm sorry, but you guys are going to have to go.

01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:22.920
I really wish they wouldn't attack.

01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:24.920
Oh, hello! Are you the person I need?

01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:26.920
Man who is not man.

01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:28.920
And Navi who is not Navi.

01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:30.920
You are a puzzle.

01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:32.920
Piece of Ewa's puzzle.

01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:34.920
Oh!

01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:36.920
Okay, I'm dreamwalking.

01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:38.920
Have we got an upgrade?

01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:40.920
Uh, hi.

01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:42.920
Yes, hi.

01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:44.920
Why is it you walk my dream?

01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:46.920
I thought no scrawny stream today?

01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:48.920
Are you sure about that?

01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:50.920
Shibi Reminder!

01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:52.920
Okay, for those of you who are listening in

01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:54.920
and are part of the Hair M,

01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:56.920
Shibi Cottonbomb

01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:58.920
is going live

01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:00.920
in T-minus.

01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:02.920
Four minutes.

01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:04.920
She may actually be on the loading screen.

01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:08.920
Eh, but yes.

01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:10.920
If there's any new YouTube mods lurking,

01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:12.920
you are welcome to speak!

01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:14.920
But then I remove your speaking privileges

01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:16.920
instantly.

01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:18.920
Class of 09.

01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:20.920
What is Class of 09?

01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:22.920
Have you guys played that?

01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:24.920
Scrawny Streams never end.

01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:26.920
The Return of Herald Endurance Cuttlefish.

01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:30.920
As I play the Navi part,

01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:32.920
I did it later as a human.

01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:34.920
Wrong.

01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:36.920
I've literally never done the RDA save.

01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:38.920
Right, we will take...

01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:40.920
Oh, look how beautiful this is.

01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:42.920
Literally glowing in the dark

01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:44.920
is just stunning.

01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:46.920
Oh, could you imagine it

01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:48.920
with graphics that are updated?

01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:50.920
Like, ugh.

01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:52.920
I have no idea what's in the new avatar game.

01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:54.920
Maybe we should play it for the first time together,

01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:56.920
but I think it is as beautiful as this.

01:56:56.920 --> 01:56:58.920
Right, why am I here?

01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:00.920
Oh, to get these crystals.

01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:02.920
Okay.

01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:04.920
We're just gonna ignore.

01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:08.920
Um...

01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:10.920
Because if we can just run

01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:12.920
in and out of these sections,

01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:14.920
if you hang around and kill anything,

01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:16.920
yes, you will get faster XP!

01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:18.920
Faster XP!

01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:20.920
Oh, I don't want my horse to die.

01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:22.920
I'm so sorry, Mr. Horsey.

01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:24.920
Please don't die.

01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:26.920
Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:28.920
Come on. We need to get out of here.

01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:30.920
Like, right now, I don't want you to pass away.

01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:32.920
I want you to have a happy life

01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:34.920
and retire at your old age.

01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:36.920
Okay.

01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:38.920
And, wait, this horse here

01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:40.920
is getting attacked as well?

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:42.920
Oh, it's beating up that mech.

01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:44.920
I was gonna actually take it so this one can live

01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:46.920
and out, but...

01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:48.920
Oh, I don't know if we're gonna make it

01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:50.920
if they've got flippin' flamethrowers

01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:52.920
and I've got the wrong way because again,

01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:54.920
it all turned around.

01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:56.920
Oh, please, live, little horsey.

01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:58.920
Oh, no! The horsey's not gonna...

01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:00.920
Right, that's it. We're clearing this out.

01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:02.920
We're clearing this out. Leave my horse alone.

01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:04.920
Everything is so strong!

01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:08.920
Who, who, who?

01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:10.920
You, perish.

01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:12.920
Gosh.

01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:14.920
I don't have anyone to take out my special one.

01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:16.920
Right, I'm healing because we're going...

01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:18.920
Oh!

01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:20.920
Wait, I actually came out in your avatar.

01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:22.920
Yeah, there's a new one.

01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:24.920
Didn't check it out yet.

01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:26.920
I'm gonna take more samples because I've actually only got three.

01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:28.920
Wait, how far away?

01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:30.920
It's a wee bit away.

01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:32.920
It's a wee bit away.

01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:34.920
Alright, we are gonna pick up cell samples.

01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:36.920
Just...

01:58:36.920 --> 01:58:38.920
No! My horse was still going to retirement!

01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:40.920
You're so mean!

01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:42.920
Ow!

01:58:42.920 --> 01:58:44.920
Did that plant just smack me back?

01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:46.920
Bang!

01:58:46.920 --> 01:58:48.920
The horse has already passed away.

01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:50.920
Man, he had a pension fund

01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:52.920
and everything.

01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:54.920
Imagine working your whole life.

01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:56.920
Actually, I read a story about like that.

01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:58.920
Where someone worked their whole life

01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:00.920
and they got one week of retirement and passed away.

01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:02.920
And it was like, I would be so mad.

01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:04.920
I would be so mad.

01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:06.920
I would explain to Death himself

01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:08.920
like, look mate,

01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:10.920
I've kind of sweat my whole life.

01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:12.920
Direct Brian!

01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:30.920
I...

01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:32.920
I remember the game couldn't be played by streamers

01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:34.920
on the basis of...

01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:36.920
Like, it's super easy to get like your IP going.

01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:38.920
Like, it's super easy to get like your IP going.

01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:40.920
Um...

01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:42.920
But if they fixed it, honestly,

01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:44.920
black ops with the boys.

01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:46.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:50.920
Have a little drink, have a sipping tin.

01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:52.920
Thank you very much for the tip.

01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:54.920
Tarja, I appreciate that.

01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:56.920
Yeah.

01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:58.920
Shawnee, the horses only live for three days anyway.

01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:00.920
What? And Pandora?

02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:02.920
I'm gonna hang with Sheep now.

02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:04.920
She's live with classable name

02:00:04.920 --> 02:00:06.920
which I actually don't know what the good is about.

02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:08.920
But...

02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:10.920
I imagine. Had rails, it was that basically how to...

02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:12.920
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:14.920
But yeah.

02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:18.920
We must draw Harmonic from tree.

02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:20.920
Shawnee, think with tree.

02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:22.920
Help find Harmonic.

02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:24.920
Oh no.

02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:26.920
Harmonics, help find sleeping well of swords.

02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:28.920
I think I know where this is gonna go.

02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:34.920
Oh!

02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:38.920
Okay, that line delivery

02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:40.920
was a bit...

02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:42.920
No!

02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:44.920
Lungori.

02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:46.920
No, refling.

02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:48.920
Don't die.

02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:52.920
I will say one thing.

02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:54.920
For the VAs of this game,

02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:56.920
especially for older games in the past,

02:00:56.920 --> 02:00:58.920
odds are they had no idea

02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:00.920
what the scene actually had

02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:02.920
and they were just given a script

02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:04.920
and just said

02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:06.920
they don't know the depth of the script or what occurred.

02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:08.920
It was only until recent stuff

02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:10.920
where actors can see live what they're performing.

02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:12.920
So...

02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:14.920
Follow the sound of vibrations

02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:16.920
and find tuning points.

02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:20.920
Huh?

02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:22.920
Oh!

02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:26.920
Okay, if there's three,

02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:28.920
it's probably gonna be identical.

02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:30.920
Yeah, okay.

02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:32.920
Wait, hold on.

02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:34.920
Yeah, okay, and then the last one's gonna be like right here.

02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:36.920
Because of the way triangles work.

02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:38.920
Yeah, I love triangles.

02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:40.920
What's your...

02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:42.920
Yeah, you know what, favorite shape?

02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:44.920
I'ma give it in our rectangle.

02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:46.920
Triangle or rectangle for favorite shape.

02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:50.920
Oh, it's singing to me. Hold on.

02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:52.920
I feel like something mystical is about to happen.

02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:54.920
I'm actually getting a bit scared.

02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:00.920
Hydration check.

02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:04.920
Oh, no.

02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:08.920
So it was the same as the Sonic Adventure show.

02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:10.920
It's a wooden delivery, get it?

02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:12.920
Because of the trees?

02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:14.920
It was a wooden delivery.

02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:20.920
Oh, shucks.

02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:22.920
I came up with that myself.

02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:24.920
Came up with that comment myself.

02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:26.920
I'm so wetty as a streamer, aren't I?

02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:30.920
I'm just gonna start stealing your guys's

02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:32.920
like witty comments.

02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:34.920
And then doing that over.

02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:36.920
Oh, I have a new armor.

02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:38.920
New armor.

02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:40.920
Oh my god, girl game, girl game.

02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:42.920
Oh, yeah, like the protection.

02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:44.920
What is vitality?

02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:46.920
What does that mean?

02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:48.920
More health?

02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:50.920
They have more health overall because of the armor?

02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:52.920
Yeah, well, you can see where they added more armor on to me.

02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:54.920
You have solved content creation.

02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:56.920
Okay, well, what am I?

02:02:56.920 --> 02:02:58.920
Looks like...

02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:00.920
Oh, that's proper harmonized.

02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:04.920
Yeah, good luck hitting them.

02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:06.920
Nope, that's long time.

02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:08.920
Armor barely covers anything.

02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:10.920
And honestly, like,

02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:12.920
they are using...

02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:14.920
Right, we're going to home tree.

02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:16.920
Wait, we're going back to home tree?

02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:18.920
Oh, what?

02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:20.920
I'm about to report to them that, oh, by the way,

02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:22.920
Longody's dead.

02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:24.920
I'm going to cry from that joke literally.

02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:26.920
What, cry of pain?

02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:28.920
Or just like, just like how ridiculous it was?

02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:32.920
Okay, we are going to be polite

02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:34.920
to Ewa and respect the home tree

02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:36.920
by not doing backflips all the way up

02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:38.920
the trunk of the tree.

02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:40.920
Okay.

02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:42.920
Oh my god, it's tree balls.

02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:44.920
We love tree balls.

02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:46.920
This is getting very bright in here.

02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:48.920
I'm not gonna lie.

02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:50.920
Do I need to recalibrate? Hold on.

02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:52.920
Professional streamer, I think I need to recalibrate my muscles.

02:03:56.920 --> 02:03:58.920
Okay, there we go.

02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:00.920
Recalibrating.

02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:08.920
Oh, we did actually report Longody's passing.

02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:10.920
Okay.

02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:16.920
Not the thumbs up!

02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:18.920
Not the thumbs up.

02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:20.920
So human of you, please don't do that again.

02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:24.920
Thumbs up.

02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:26.920
Can I just hum a few bars?

02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:28.920
A little tap on the shoulder.

02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:30.920
Sing!

02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:32.920
What am I saying?

02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:34.920
Am I actually just like...

02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:36.920
Is this like a minigame or any like...

02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:42.920
What on earth is this freaky stuff going on here?

02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:44.920
Uh...

02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:48.920
I don't even remember that at all.

02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:50.920
Thumbs up!

02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:52.920
Let's just try to come through.

02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:04.920
Okay.

02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:06.920
Alright.

02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:14.920
So this is campaign mode getting explained to us.

02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:18.920
I totally know the plot inside out from this game.

02:05:20.920 --> 02:05:22.920
Yeah.

02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:24.920
Assassin's Creed, I know the plot of this.

02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:30.920
All I know is that we're doing good for the planet.

02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:32.920
No, please, even if not directed at me, they hurt anyway.

02:05:38.920 --> 02:05:40.920
What if the trees wanted to see a sick backflip?

02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:44.920
I don't know.

02:05:44.920 --> 02:05:46.920
Mission complete.

02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:48.920
Mission complete.

02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:50.920
Oh, I'm not to jump around.

02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:52.920
Jump up.

02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:54.920
Can I put my weapons away?

02:05:54.920 --> 02:05:56.920
I feel like having weapons out in this location isn't very pleasant.

02:05:56.920 --> 02:05:58.920
No, put the RDA gun on me.

02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:02.920
Why is this so bright?

02:06:02.920 --> 02:06:04.920
I don't ever... Oh my god!

02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:06.920
I don't ever recall that issue.

02:06:06.920 --> 02:06:08.920
Oh, hello again.

02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:10.920
I would like to talk to you for my next mission.

02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:16.920
Doroknaring.

02:06:20.920 --> 02:06:22.920
Yeah, he's probably a bit mad at me for, you know,

02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:24.920
spending five years in cryo.

02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:30.920
Yeah.

02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:32.920
Never on the enemy side.

02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:34.920
But we're the goodies, so they're the enemies.

02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:38.920
We're healing nature.

02:06:38.920 --> 02:06:40.920
We're healing nature.

02:06:40.920 --> 02:06:44.920
Mother nature always reclaims all.

02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:48.920
Mother, mother, mother, mother nature.

02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:52.920
This looks like a darker map.

02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:54.920
Beautiful.

02:06:54.920 --> 02:06:56.920
Toph ASMR will play?

02:06:58.920 --> 02:07:00.920
I can't really do later voices like Toph.

02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:02.920
Oh, Katana.

02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:06.920
Look, there's the castle.

02:07:06.920 --> 02:07:08.920
That's what I would say if I could see

02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:10.920
something.

02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:12.920
If I wasn't blind.

02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:14.920
I can't really hear a voice at all.

02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:18.920
Is it a castle?

02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:20.920
There's something in the sand.

02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:22.920
Or the library? There's the library.

02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:24.920
Katana.

02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:26.920
Oh, sorry. It's not Katana.

02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:28.920
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:32.920
It's upside down.

02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:34.920
Isn't it?

02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:38.920
Katana? Close enough. I know. I know.

02:07:38.920 --> 02:07:40.920
Katana wins.

02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:42.920
Good luck, Tanjala.

02:07:42.920 --> 02:07:44.920
Good luck, Tanjala.

02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:46.920
Oh, who's this? Hello. How do you do?

02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:50.920
Oh, I need a pause.

02:07:50.920 --> 02:07:52.920
Pause on the shards. Pause champ on the shards.

02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:58.920
A little cheeky hydration check.

02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:00.920
A little cheeky hydration check.

02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:06.920
There's the library.

02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:08.920
That's what it would sound like

02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:10.920
if one of us would bother you.

02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:20.920
Okay, I'm going to say something controversial.

02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:24.920
You know when maps are straight ahead like this?

02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:26.920
Yeah?

02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:28.920
I like that.

02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:30.920
I appreciate when games don't make you go back and forth

02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:34.920
and you just keep going forward.

02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:36.920
When a game makes you turn around

02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:38.920
to go do something on the map

02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:40.920
that you were previously at that area...

02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:46.920
However,

02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:50.920
when a game makes it nice and linear...

02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:54.920
I'm not going to lie, I almost fell off there.

02:08:54.920 --> 02:08:56.920
Oh, and I can't actually see where I'm supposed to go.

02:08:56.920 --> 02:08:58.920
Thanks to the sleeve.

02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:00.920
Oh, there we go.

02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:02.920
Backtrack hate.

02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:04.920
Yeah, backtracking a bit.

02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:08.920
Okay.

02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:10.920
Let's see how it goes.

02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:12.920
Okay, so if you take the high ground...

02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:16.920
Wait, look! That's why they attack me.

02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:18.920
They've got backpacks on the wolves

02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:20.920
and that's why they attack me.

02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:22.920
I'm just thinking.

02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:24.920
The RDA put like main control devices

02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:26.920
on the wolves

02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:28.920
and now they want to attack me even though I'm Navi.

02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:32.920
I'm Navi and I'm navigating.

02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:34.920
What the heck am I doing here?

02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:36.920
Am I destroying stuff?

02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:40.920
Don't have to ask me twice!

02:09:42.920 --> 02:09:44.920
Challenge complete.

02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:46.920
I'm going to do it from up here.

02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:48.920
Oh, I see.

02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:50.920
So I'm releasing the native

02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:52.920
Navi

02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:54.920
and destroying the...

02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:56.920
Jesus.

02:09:56.920 --> 02:09:58.920
Why?

02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:00.920
We're literally so low level

02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:02.920
we're not even one-shotting.

02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:06.920
Can I break you?

02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:08.920
Oh, I can.

02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:12.920
I like how he just don't.

02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:14.920
Oh, he like dives over.

02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:16.920
I mean, honestly, if an arrow struck me

02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:18.920
I'd probably...

02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:20.920
Oh, we did it!

02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:22.920
Like, Ori and the Blame Force.

02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:26.920
I tru...

02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:28.920
Wait, wait, wait.

02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:30.920
What am I supposed to do with that?

02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:32.920
Destroy it?

02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:34.920
I'm just going to pump...

02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:36.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me pump all the ammo into it.

02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:38.920
Where's my gun?

02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:40.920
I can't...

02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:42.920
Your hate, you're teasing me.

02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:44.920
I'm not even hitting you.

02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:46.920
Bro.

02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:48.920
You're literally right under the tree.

02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:50.920
I'm going to have to go...

02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:54.920
No, stop shooting me.

02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:56.920
I need to destroy this.

02:10:56.920 --> 02:10:58.920
Hello?

02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:00.920
Oh, wait, oh, wait.

02:11:00.920 --> 02:11:02.920
Oh.

02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:04.920
No?

02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:06.920
Game?

02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:10.920
Game?

02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:12.920
Game?

02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:14.920
Do I need...

02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:16.920
To hit the other side of it, I guess?

02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:20.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:22.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:24.920
Oh, my God.

02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:26.920
Jeez, Louise.

02:11:26.920 --> 02:11:28.920
They are killing us here.

02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:30.920
That was very strange.

02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:32.920
But we did it. That's the main thing.

02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:34.920
Uh, maybe we should not.

02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:36.920
Are you trying to shoot that guy?

02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:38.920
And you're missing, like, horribly? Oh, you are.

02:11:38.920 --> 02:11:43.380
Oh, and I'm missing horribly too. You know that both of us are as bad as each other

02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:48.060
He healed as I bruh come on

02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:52.980
Hello, would you like to talk to me? Oh

02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:56.480
Oh for sure

02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:05.920
Does he know I'm coming no that check and works if the map is good. Yes, I would argue yeah, I

02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:09.760
Did try and play Ori in the blind forest

02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:18.160
But I was just to pay to pay go. It's definitely not a stream game for me, but one of the other girls

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:25.200
Likely would play it. I feel like it's a and I definitely chill stream chill stream. Yeah

02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:30.240
This is actually a really beautiful map because you get to run along the little tree roots

02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:33.320
Which I really like yay nature nature wins again

02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:43.960
Right I can see and we're maybe fighting here or are we

02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:52.160
Are we just running through this oh, wow, we actually did pretty decent damage

02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:55.200
Yeah, wow, I'll take that

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
I think

02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:04.040
They keep I can only I'm okay hold on I

02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:09.760
It doesn't seem like an objective area because of that reason. I'm just gonna do this

02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:13.920
I know I shouldn't I know I should probably like level up a bit

02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:17.120
But I am very happy just to keep walking on the tree trunks

02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:24.760
You want a non chill stream place a list? I've seen a lot of streamers place a list like it's interesting to see what like

02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:29.960
Oh, I'm in trouble. Oh, I'm in trouble. Oh, I'm in trouble. Oh

02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:36.920
My god, I did not remember being in so much trouble playing this game

02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:42.040
What's the way? I think it's maybe I used to farm areas to level up and I was just so OP

02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:47.320
Because I think this map. We're actually supposed to be unlocking a green

02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:50.080
Armor right now

02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:52.080
But I ain't doing it

02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:59.640
I'm just doing some back foot literally backflip dodge and bullets right we're getting ready to attack these guys

02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:06.120
But I need to actually activate the quest by talking to this guy before we attack and release more of Pandora's

02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:08.220
me

02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:09.720
How can I help?

02:14:09.720 --> 02:14:11.720
You would not like my answer

02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:14.760
Listen like it or not. You've got my help on this one

02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:16.280
string

02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:19.280
The top two loader sky machines with weapons

02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:24.840
Was it I think for anyone who did actually watch the first avatar movie

02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:27.200
I think scound means like idiot or something like that like

02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:30.700
You have to go like scum or else. You're not saying it, right?

02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:41.320
Yeah, I feel like I replayed and leveled up a lot more as a child and right now

02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:46.640
We're just like speedrunning through this although when you do complete a mission you do get like a nice chunk of XP so

02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:48.440
Oh

02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:52.160
Speaking of leveling up. I have a six-minute timer at the top of the screen

02:14:54.880 --> 02:15:01.880
That looks like a protection spell that I am putting on I didn't realize I unlocked some sort of protection thing

02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:09.480
I definitely want to put whatever that is greatly reduces. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, we'll definitely be utilizing that right woman to do

02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:12.760
Right, let's test this out. Oh

02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:19.320
I'm not to destroy the ship jump up here

02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:24.680
Hello, oh

02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:30.360
Wait, I can just yeah, is this what I'm supposed to destroy. Oh

02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:36.640
Yeah, okay is yeah, take that you like that. Yeah, you like a big adult

02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:41.520
Oh, I'm gonna get a blurt raid cuz it's face a minute. I'm getting I'm getting shaky. I'm getting scared

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:50.440
Okay, we're fine. We're fine. Like honestly smooth sailing. Okay, the NPCs aren't really locking on to me too well because of the distance

02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:53.560
But we're making it. We're making it

02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:58.080
They're getting a bit closer. So I might have to start shooting them a wee bit

02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:03.840
Well, that was a good shot there one more and then that's three of four

02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:11.160
You're telling me that quad aero thing can stay up with three. I don't believe it

02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:18.080
One more two more. I'm not hitting that. Oh, it's not registering

02:16:19.720 --> 02:16:22.200
It's gonna spam it down. Am I supposed to

02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:29.160
Of course the thing I want is like not facing me

02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:34.320
Okay, they were

02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:36.320
I

02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:41.200
Human iron

02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:49.280
Literally that the steel a crann is no match for me. I'm gonna look this stuff. I've got three revives. Oh

02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:53.280
My gosh, oh

02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:56.960
The poor babies they're not even attacking us

02:16:57.680 --> 02:17:02.720
Out you come baby. Wait, so okay looks like regular ones don't attack me anymore. Hello

02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:10.680
Yes, they were cruel to him if we can heal his wounds, you will fight

02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:16.560
I think we're gonna raid him every palulu. Whatever I've ever meant was to eat me alive

02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:24.480
He is still our brother. We will heal him with a was medicine. Oh, that's so cute. We're helping the little forest prayers

02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:27.040
Bring them to me

02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:31.520
What do you need? I'm sorry medication for the guy

02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:38.520
I'll just basic flowers. That's fine. I can get that. That's that's the problem. Hold on. Hold that thought little guy

02:17:38.520 --> 02:17:40.520
I'm coming back

02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:46.800
And then I think we get to ride him into battle like a horse, but it's not a horse

02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:51.400
I think it's called a fanator if I remember correctly. Oh

02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:55.600
My goodness. I remember that time I said in this map, you don't have to backtrack

02:17:56.600 --> 02:18:02.420
Honestly, it's not that bad though because it's to help an animal and you know, we

02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:07.160
Shadow wizard money gang. We love healing nature from these parts

02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:11.440
I'm going in

02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:18.560
Oh, I mean sprayed and prayed but they can't get me I'm too good

02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:24.400
Gather plants from the banshee's nest. Oh, that's what

02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:27.880
Suppose we'd be comfortable

02:18:29.320 --> 02:18:31.320
Pandora is Ohio, but more natural

02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:37.640
You're not allowed to speak for the next 20 seconds, do you understand me

02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:41.880
Don't say that again

02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:53.440
I'm so excited for your ace mushroom. I just want new earbuds for oh, you're making a good. I hope it is not a disappointment

02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:55.160
I

02:18:55.160 --> 02:19:00.280
Most likely will not do ear licking. I'm just gonna say that now before anyone gets thingy

02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:05.160
I have no idea what an earth is going on with YouTube and ear licking at the moment

02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:09.800
Something there's either a policy update being pushed or something

02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:12.960
But for some reason anime earlicks bad

02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:15.480
in real life human person

02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:17.520
earlicks fine, so I

02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:21.440
Don't want you be disappointed. I have put a lot of thought and effort into it

02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:28.040
So hopefully the smart is good. I don't know how long I'm gonna stream for and the problem is I get really distracted when like I

02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:31.640
Like I constantly read your guys's stuff because you guys make me laugh all the time

02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:36.480
So I'm not really sure how official and ASMR. It's gonna be so do apologize

02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:40.640
It's probably I'll probably try hard for like 15 minutes, and then it's just gonna

02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:43.840
Oh, that's so cool

02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:46.040
rides a sacred beast

02:19:46.200 --> 02:19:48.280
Has a will go mad. No

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.800
Whiskers honestly though we whiskers

02:19:56.440 --> 02:20:03.240
It's impossible because YouTube can't tell the difference I that's my theory at the moment is that anime is getting

02:20:03.880 --> 02:20:07.480
Because YouTube are saying it's implied else

02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:13.040
Whereas we all know like what actual ear licking sounds like because it's literally a 3d microphone

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:18.640
So it's really putting a bit of a hindrance on my plans

02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:24.000
My

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:30.800
Yard is this not the coolest ride you've ever seen. Oh my god. It's so cool. Oh, he leaves

02:20:31.360 --> 02:20:33.360
Can you go faster? Oh?

02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:35.360
He attacks. Oh

02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:38.800
That's okay. Can you jump? Oh, no, that's not jump. Oh

02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:44.120
Wait, wait, did I move as it moves? Oh, can you jump?

02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:46.240
Oh

02:20:47.800 --> 02:20:52.440
He's so slick looking like genuinely so slick

02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:55.800
Not a hero. No, how do you keep warm?

02:20:57.640 --> 02:21:00.880
Like almost laughing with the highlight you'll be fine

02:21:02.200 --> 02:21:05.160
Come on buddy. Come on whiskers. Let's get them

02:21:06.360 --> 02:21:08.160
Wait

02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:10.160
Oh, I'm just going back to talk

02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:16.600
It's just like it literally looks like he's been dropped in tower the first thing but it's just heavy is a little hairless thing

02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:18.600
I don't like you

02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:24.840
Okay

02:21:26.480 --> 02:21:33.720
Why do not speak like you understand why is she so informal when talking to this guy

02:21:34.360 --> 02:21:38.240
You have to pick your battles be this guy speaking a second language

02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:43.880
But at least try and speak clear English, you know, so it's easier for him Danny go back before it's okay

02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:49.720
You're ready whiskers. Oh, I did not mean to do that, but I was absolutely horrifying

02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:52.360
Right, come on whiskers. Let's get them

02:21:58.200 --> 02:22:01.720
Hopefully you have a lot of help with yours because I'm not doing any combat

02:22:04.720 --> 02:22:06.720
Whiskers

02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:09.520
Can you go across this stuff? Oh

02:22:10.120 --> 02:22:15.440
You can oh, you're actually such a smart kitty. Honestly, you're smart

02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:20.360
Okay, I auto jump if it's quite others

02:22:20.840 --> 02:22:25.600
To please don't attack quest mark. I don't think they attack me anymore

02:22:27.160 --> 02:22:30.880
Speaking of contact the enemy's got a lot of enemies

02:22:31.880 --> 02:22:39.040
Okay, we're all good whiskers made it into a happy retire. There's another whiz. How many whiskers are there?

02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:42.680
bingus some

02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:51.560
What is going on in the background

02:22:55.760 --> 02:22:57.760
Cutscene moment

02:22:58.480 --> 02:23:06.480
I can't see moment. Hello cut scene moment. Hello. I think I'm stuck in it

02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:17.120
Just absolutely chaos in the background by the way

02:23:17.120 --> 02:23:19.120
In

02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:26.980
Game oh, and we got a level up as well, right we need to help out that

02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:33.280
Right, hold on leave with

02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:38.160
Stop it

02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:45.040
Right, I'm just gonna do melee for the fix

02:23:47.840 --> 02:23:49.840
I

02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:54.320
What no health why no health?

02:23:55.040 --> 02:24:00.440
I'm doing my spell. Am I supposed to be on whiskers. I think I'm supposed to be on whiskers

02:24:01.600 --> 02:24:03.600
Tear them up whiskers tear them up

02:24:04.360 --> 02:24:07.800
That's right. Who's a good kitty. You're gonna get some treaties after this

02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:15.320
Mr.. Whiskers going crazy in the background

02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:24.000
Just a reminder that she can't bomb is a lie if you'd care to watch class of

02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:31.720
Oh

02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:35.240
No, my kitty's losing health. I can't heal on

02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:42.480
Oh, baby, I don't want you to perish. I want you to have happy retirement

02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:44.480
And

02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:50.560
Oh, there's no way kitty's gonna deal with these max without being perished

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:55.360
Unless I put them away right you stay there

02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:04.320
Oh my goodness and I don't have my protection spell yet

02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:08.000
Um

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.800
I don't have protection spell I'm much late. Oh

02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:15.040
Kitty I might need you back kitty. I might need you back

02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:21.360
Kitty, where are you kitty? You're saving me kitty

02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:28.240
Yes, knock them over. Yes. Yes. Oh, you're so smart. You're so smart. You're so smart

02:25:29.440 --> 02:25:31.600
Oh, you're such a good smarty party

02:25:32.320 --> 02:25:34.320
Yeah, I do need to heal in a moment

02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:36.400
But I think we're doing all right. What's going on here?

02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:40.880
You you've glitched out and you're not even fighting alongside me. So that's fine

02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:49.920
All the kitty. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, heal heal heal heal heal

02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:54.400
Oh, I've casted protection. I've casted protection

02:25:55.920 --> 02:25:59.680
I did crash protection, but I was too late because I healed first I should have

02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:04.800
Okay, okay, we can do that. This is super easy to get them

02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:07.760
Where are it? Where's all the ones?

02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:11.200
Where are they?

02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:13.840
Two more

02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:15.200
Oh, there you are

02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:18.960
Okay, we're done. Oh, there's three more. Are you telling me stickers?

02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:24.720
Uh, hopefully the cat didn't die then

02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:29.840
Okay, actually I'm gonna oh wait, no

02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:32.800
Hmm

02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:42.960
I cast skill issue

02:26:50.800 --> 02:26:54.800
Yes, we can do that one more shard and then we do a song a little song and dance

02:26:55.360 --> 02:26:57.360
She knows

02:27:03.120 --> 02:27:05.120
Oh, that is really rough

02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:09.360
That was a rough landing with the animation on the uh navi there. I have to admit

02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:12.640
Bending with the uh

02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:19.840
Right, let's unlock the home tree. No, not home tree tree of vision, which lets us teleport around the map

02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:23.280
Yeah, it was crunchy. That was crunchy. That was 2009 showing

02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:31.840
I never know how long these like bigger games take to develop. I still think it's like three years development two years development

02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:39.280
This smallest development game time crunch I ever heard was followed new vegas. That was like big like that

02:27:40.400 --> 02:27:47.680
I think they said it was 11 months development. Um, which was crazy all things considered

02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:50.400
Uh

02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:55.760
I think we just walk the rest of the writer come in kendrick. Tell me some good news

02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:08.880
Raider hardly even nor great anything else to brighten my day. Yeah, okay, so I'll start making my job. I'm sorry

02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:12.560
It's a ticking time bomb. We can't let falcon anywhere near the well

02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:17.840
She's can't keep getting away with it

02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:21.520
Hey, am I supposed to find

02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:27.840
My born you are you feel health kitty? Oh, you're not even readable actually. I'm not supposed to read them anymore

02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:31.040
Yeah, I know. I know right. I wouldn't do anymore

02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:33.520
Go give it some good

02:28:33.520 --> 02:28:35.520
A 15 year old game. Look look

02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:39.120
They didn't actually come up with something pretty decent games like back then

02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:45.920
Are you squidding me right now? Oh, brian last one for today. I got to go night night

02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:51.520
Good night. Uh, thank you for the tip, but jenga good night, and I'll see you in the morning. Hey, how long

02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:59.040
We're already two hours in so statistically we have like four. Oh, no, no one's sleeping in four hours

02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:01.040
I've taken

02:29:01.040 --> 02:29:06.080
Abomination must die. Do you wish to help us or not? Yes, I'll help you my goodness

02:29:07.440 --> 02:29:12.880
Honestly, yeah, you actually do deserve a bit sass. Uh, right. We're okay. Yeah, just go ahead

02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:20.400
Whoa, what am I supposed what animal am I supposed to eliminate?

02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:24.960
Oh actual cutscene

02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:27.840
Yeah, we do not get actual cutscenes like this often

02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:31.280
Oh

02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:40.400
Sorry, I'm petting my hair right now that the my my hair is up in a bun

02:29:43.440 --> 02:29:45.440
I've done it all that sounded rather odd

02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:50.320
Two and a half

02:29:50.720 --> 02:29:56.560
You get one more of those jokes for all your jokes will come on funny. I don't have any more sound effects to do it with

02:29:57.440 --> 02:29:59.440
I don't have any more sound effects

02:30:00.080 --> 02:30:03.760
That's them all so I can't make the joke again. I've only got crickets now

02:30:06.800 --> 02:30:08.800
Oh

02:30:09.760 --> 02:30:14.080
I really don't like hurting these guys, but if they're baddies, there's nothing I can really be

02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:17.360
I give you I send you back to awa

02:30:18.240 --> 02:30:23.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, there's a lot more of you in this plane this pen than I thought jeez

02:30:24.240 --> 02:30:26.240
What am I supposed to destroy in here?

02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:28.960
that

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Uh, I hope this works

02:30:35.440 --> 02:30:39.520
Uh, I cast protection I cast protect I read

02:30:43.120 --> 02:30:47.120
I'm stuck in the corner. I cast protection

02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:55.200
Okay, thank god this game is so buggy. Oh, I didn't mean to do that. I didn't mean to heal I wasted that heal

02:30:57.440 --> 02:31:02.720
Oh, this is making me nervous. Haha. You can't come on the rock. You can't come on the rock

02:31:04.400 --> 02:31:08.800
Most games for older games elevation really bugs out the ai's that they have

02:31:09.120 --> 02:31:14.560
So don't be afraid to use elevation to your advantage because then you get moments like this

02:31:14.960 --> 02:31:20.320
Where you can just have a good time because they can't get on the elevation. Okay

02:31:21.200 --> 02:31:25.840
For you, glad that's over because that is really not an easy enemy to defeat in the rail

02:31:26.720 --> 02:31:29.920
My gasman buck rug. Shona, you seem to have upgraded

02:31:30.720 --> 02:31:32.720
Upgrades available top left. Wait actually

02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:41.200
No, I don't I don't unless it's that greatly improved damage for a short amount of time

02:31:43.600 --> 02:31:49.920
Can I yeah like for some reason if you don't like tab over these it will constantly tell you you have like weapon upgrades and stuff

02:31:51.280 --> 02:31:53.280
What else have I got?

02:31:54.640 --> 02:31:59.760
Yeah, so like things get more like stronger as we progress

02:32:01.120 --> 02:32:04.640
I could do a club honestly. Let's see the club. What does it look like?

02:32:06.560 --> 02:32:08.560
Oh, that's a meaty swing

02:32:11.040 --> 02:32:14.080
Oh, that's a load up though to get that that's quite a load up

02:32:15.040 --> 02:32:21.520
Oh, yeah that uh, it doesn't okay. No, this is for these guys. It's the double

02:32:22.080 --> 02:32:24.080
It's the double for me that you're wield

02:32:25.280 --> 02:32:30.960
Oh, why would you guys even be in a broken facility? Be honest right now

02:32:34.800 --> 02:32:37.840
Oh, why how are you even getting me through a fence?

02:32:37.920 --> 02:32:39.920
Oh

02:32:40.160 --> 02:32:44.640
Well, I need to aim you need to reload so which one of us is going to go down first

02:32:45.760 --> 02:32:47.760
The yeah the club's too slow

02:32:48.960 --> 02:32:50.960
All right, I'm just gonna go for it

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:57.040
Okay. Yeah one shot with the things I'll take that. Is there anyone else here? I hear him

02:32:57.840 --> 02:33:00.160
I hear him. I can't see him. Oh, he's so tiny

02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:03.200
Oh, you're so tiny. I can't even see it

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Ha ha ha you're welcome

02:33:08.800 --> 02:33:11.520
Gank up on gank up on that's what I get for making a joke

02:33:14.560 --> 02:33:16.560
Spank spank spank

02:33:18.800 --> 02:33:21.600
Hello, scrawny there was no notification for your shuman discord

02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:29.440
Discord hates me. I can't believe it. I'm not just I'm not discord's little kitten or whatever. I said anything that thing

02:33:30.400 --> 02:33:37.280
Uh, she be is live right now with class of 09 if that game is more of an interest to you because I'm literally playing the most like

02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:39.520
Unknown game ever

02:33:39.520 --> 02:33:41.840
I don't know if this game out on

02:33:42.480 --> 02:33:43.920
PlayStation

02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:48.560
In that as well. I don't remember it being. Oh, there's a Thanator in here

02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:51.520
Where is it?

02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:55.840
Oh, I hear it. Where is it? Oh, it's literally right there

02:33:56.800 --> 02:33:59.040
Uh, we'll just spray it down

02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:05.760
Oh, I'm already out of ammo

02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:09.200
I thought I was gonna be like

02:34:09.920 --> 02:34:14.720
Oh, okay. Now he's not coded to go any further. I was gonna say I'm like

02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:20.640
I didn't I think it was coded to go any further. This is another thing about older games

02:34:20.960 --> 02:34:24.960
You can like just absolutely smurf them because

02:34:25.440 --> 02:34:29.920
There's only so much game memory and game storage that they can allocate for areas

02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:36.080
Which means coding wise they will just stop enemies from doing stuff like that. I just I just love it

02:34:36.080 --> 02:34:41.040
I appreciate it so much like it just makes everything nice and easy peasy lemon squeezy

02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:45.840
What you got to complain about? Huh? What you got to complain about?

02:34:46.560 --> 02:34:51.520
I know the game did come out on PlayStation 3. Okay. Okay. So it wasn't I didn't think it was an xbox exclusive

02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:55.040
I but I don't think ever got released on steam. Whoa

02:34:57.040 --> 02:34:59.040
Hi

02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:03.040
Hydration check, I mean

02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:11.360
I'm gaming I'm not doing this for me. There's a lot more to cheese. I'm cheese and it's not smurfing it cheese

02:35:11.360 --> 02:35:13.360
You think I enjoy this

02:35:14.400 --> 02:35:19.920
How much do I need to play for that RDA? I've never done it. I've genuinely never done it. I don't think

02:35:20.880 --> 02:35:23.840
So you don't need to pay anything at all. I've got to an RDA

02:35:29.040 --> 02:35:34.240
I assume the RDA is just like congrats. You've destroyed the planet. Thanks. And then the game then the credits just roll

02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:36.720
That's how I imagine the RDA side ends

02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:45.360
The are you afraid of are you afraid of yourself for beating a helpless NPC? Hold on. I'm getting rolled

02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:52.960
Oh my armor. I've just noticed that my armor. Oh my god girl moment. I'm a good fashion show fashion

02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:56.800
I've got a passion. Whoa. Look at that protection. What are you squidding me right now?

02:35:58.400 --> 02:36:03.440
Today I learned that if you click on the hashtag smuttlefish hashtag in the stream description

02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:07.840
One of the first videos shown is the puffer fish gagging on a carrot video

02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:12.800
Actually, thank you for the tip. Sorry y'all or sorry y'all

02:36:14.160 --> 02:36:16.960
Uh, oh that poor that poor little guy

02:36:20.320 --> 02:36:23.360
But yeah fashion show momento so human

02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:29.520
Basic armor a little bit of an upgrade and then we've got like location based armor. I knew it

02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:32.160
So hopefully we can take a wall open now

02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:35.440
Because uh, are we faster as well?

02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:39.600
Oh

02:36:39.920 --> 02:36:44.960
Who's here? Oh, why are you here? This is navi

02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:50.000
Um destroying pandora just trying to aim for these guys. Let me put my glycs on

Can I see none?

02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:55.360
Wow

02:36:55.520 --> 02:37:02.160
I am invisible you shouldn't be shitting me anymore. I'm literally invisible

02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:09.600
I'm not gonna heal naturally or don't need to pop her heal. I need to pop

02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:15.040
Take this

02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:20.880
Oh, I see the tnt thing. I'm going to grab the crystal before it gets me outside. I'm going to craft. I just

Oh, oh that sprint is so good. Oh my I just came out of nowhere. He blinked and he was gone

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Oh, let me pick up more samples

02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:36.160
Oh, get me out here. There's too much

02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:41.120
If they start having like knockback, that's when it gets dangerous like being in the middle of the enemies

02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:45.280
So do forgive me if I literally just blow past all these sections

02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:48.240
Oh

02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:50.240
I can do that. That's fine

02:37:50.480 --> 02:37:52.480
That's fine

02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:55.040
Okay, okay, we're we're getting oh

02:37:56.960 --> 02:37:58.960
So

02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:03.040
Ah see when they do that they stall you that's when you get

02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:13.200
Literally tnt in the sky

02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:16.160
Okay, we made it. We made it

02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:19.040
Let me just unlock this little tree of

02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:22.720
You can't see me. No

02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:26.960
Now able rider knee win the vitality and protection boost. Yeah

02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:29.840
Did you find out why they're pulling out?

02:38:30.080 --> 02:38:36.080
The daughter gather in force mental birds field of sky. You don't want to pull her there any humans

02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:42.640
A storm is coming the other song. We must return to home. Okay. We've got our second song

02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:47.040
So does that mean we need to do a third song and then we're

02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:49.520
Who am I to talk to the banshee?

02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:53.200
I

02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:00.560
It's on to happen

02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:03.200
It says yellow on the map. Am I supposed to read the ikran?

02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:06.240
No

02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:10.640
I'm sorry. I wasn't paying attention. The willow tree knee win fast. We have the advantage

02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:13.360
The willow tree

02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:16.720
I'm about to use this to teleport to here

02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:19.680
To get to home tree

02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:25.120
What

02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:31.520
Wait, was there a thing back? No, not conquest. No, not conquest. No, no, no, no

02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:34.960
We don't want to do conquest. You must do at the end of the game. No, no, no, no

02:39:34.960 --> 02:39:36.960
I already know how to play. Thank you. No

02:39:36.960 --> 02:39:38.160
Conquest

02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:41.760
Not no was there something I was supposed to pick up back there. I feel like

02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:45.520
Child support scary

02:39:45.840 --> 02:39:48.880
Is there a crystal? Oh dumb

02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:52.800
Dumb dumb dumb dumb gee

02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:58.720
I wonder if it's supposed to go here on this conveniently playful island thing. Okay. I was good. I knew him

02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:02.080
Now what was the third one here?

02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:08.240
Yeah, okay. Okay. Don't make it too. Don't make it too obvious video game devs. Don't even need yellow paint in this game

02:40:08.720 --> 02:40:10.720
Hmm

02:40:13.520 --> 02:40:18.640
Okay, we have the song my apologies does rather confuse there

02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:21.200
A human spirit lives within you

02:40:21.920 --> 02:40:26.400
If you achieve I'm becoming na vi na vi na vi na vi

02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:29.200
You bring hope coming na vi

02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:34.960
Give our call. We bring this song before taii the battle moves swiftly

02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:39.680
I fear humans are a step ahead of us. We must return song to home

02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:42.960
Mercy's just de-embed me

02:40:43.040 --> 02:40:47.120
Strongly my alt twitter's growing really fast. You are right. I'm scared

02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:51.600
But under the tweet I'm getting nervous should I post this?

02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:55.520
Yeah, you can post what you want

02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:58.960
Mary I'm going to reply mercy. You can

02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:01.760
You can

02:41:02.080 --> 02:41:07.680
Post what you like my darling whatever whatever makes you happy

02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:10.720
Yeah, I have replied to mercy

02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:18.080
For a yandere she sure does uh love being like unironical

02:41:18.080 --> 02:41:23.040
This is going to sound really weird when I say this out loud. She sure does love being a good girl and getting permission for everything

02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:25.680
for a yandere

02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:29.200
Like literally all of the girls are so fantastic

02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:35.760
Yeah, we're we're slowly getting past the stage of do I need do I need permission to do this?

02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:40.240
Do I need um because the answer is always no you do not need my permission. You are in control

02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:42.880
So I was the same

02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:45.600
The best kind of yandere

02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:48.720
You know

02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:50.640
Jesus

02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:53.920
Yeah, damn need some sunglasses to get up this tree. Um

02:41:54.320 --> 02:41:55.520
Um

02:41:55.520 --> 02:41:59.520
But yes, the girls are definitely easing into the concept that because

02:42:00.400 --> 02:42:03.200
I assume, you know, they've consumed enough kind of like

02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:08.960
Oh most future brave agencies like have this long list of rules that you have to abide by and it's like my rules are like literally

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:13.520
You know be be cool with lollipop stuff and um

02:42:14.960 --> 02:42:16.960
Uh, no no male collabs

02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:19.680
And you know that's a

02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:23.760
It gets really simple. You do everything yourself. I'm not going to tell you what to do. I'm not going to dictate your content

02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:25.040
So brian

02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:32.240
Yes, you can post whatever you want my dear mercy leaks classified military documents war thunder style

02:42:32.880 --> 02:42:35.440
I know about that if you didn't know

02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:40.720
military documents keep getting leaked in a video game because people are like

02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:46.320
They're like so like wanting everything to be correct, which is hilarious. Thank you for this hip tharya

02:42:46.800 --> 02:42:48.240
um

02:42:48.240 --> 02:42:50.240
But that's like true

02:42:50.480 --> 02:42:52.080
real and true

02:42:52.080 --> 02:42:58.400
Because what what i'm sure one of them was like they were arguing over a helicopter detailed design

02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:02.320
Either in the cockpit or something to do with a helicopter

02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:11.200
And then someone was like so tismo. They were like no, you're wrong and here's why and then they just like flop down these like

02:43:11.840 --> 02:43:14.240
Documents that shouldn't be publicly accessible

02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:17.920
Um, and it's happened multiple that law

02:43:20.480 --> 02:43:28.240
Okay, we're singing a second song i'm going to assume by the third song we will progress to the next story for element because

02:43:28.480 --> 02:43:29.360
good

02:43:29.360 --> 02:43:30.560
good

02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:32.960
Let me try a ramung nan will soon be found

02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:34.240
Okay, that's a little weird

02:43:34.240 --> 02:43:35.200
able rider

02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:36.720
Daily so many stuff

02:43:36.720 --> 02:43:38.240
challenger tank

02:43:38.240 --> 02:43:39.520
Manlet armor

02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:43.920
I break codes in a Eurocopter shells, etc

02:43:45.120 --> 02:43:47.120
It's happened 15 to 17 times

02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:56.400
Bro bro was like slams on desk. See I told you so

02:43:58.320 --> 02:44:00.320
This gen is blessed truly

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:06.640
Like it wasn't even one country leaking the info it was all of them together just so that the the

02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:14.080
Equipment and tanks and all that were accurate in game the next song. There's literally a joke zero days since last military league

02:44:15.040 --> 02:44:19.120
She sees what you may become. They don't like to be wrong exactly

02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:25.600
I'm just someone who gave me a song back home. We call that a deejay. She just stroked his chest

02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:30.240
Then you worry mate. I just collect the songs beyond the cup that is already full

02:44:31.600 --> 02:44:33.760
Look beyond the cup that's already full

02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:37.200
Oji san says as he drinks Emmys

02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:41.280
Uh, they are a ramu

02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:48.080
A certain dominance honestly actually elites really five and seven but other times they were export

02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:51.520
Uh, restricted but it could be found online

02:44:52.880 --> 02:44:57.120
I'm really proud to belong to the war thunder community for their dastardly arcs

02:44:57.120 --> 02:45:03.520
The forest birds are warriors flee before the humans. These are drinking what? Hmm

02:45:04.640 --> 02:45:10.880
The RDA must be gunning at me. I see actually all of them. You know what well matter all of them

02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:17.840
We can't escape the the p-corp jokes. Now is the time to counter their attack or must be risked in times of need

02:45:19.760 --> 02:45:21.760
Just all of them are at it honestly

02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:25.840
I mean if you think about it as there is milk heels

02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:28.560
So what would the other liquids do?

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:31.760
I don't know

02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:34.800
I don't know. We didn't lure that that wasn't concepted

02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:36.640
but

02:45:36.640 --> 02:45:44.000
Up to you what you think the other ones do uh, what is this area? I seem to have forgotten this map. I actually don't remember it

02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:46.720
The warriors here know the land

02:45:47.760 --> 02:45:51.440
Okay, please be the last song because no more song missions, please

02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:57.040
See if they can find big b. We could use this big b. All right. Just marry big b this much at this point

02:45:57.120 --> 02:45:59.120
I feel love him so much

02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:02.320
He enjoys crushing skulls of many totu

02:46:02.800 --> 02:46:04.800
Totu for humans

02:46:05.040 --> 02:46:10.240
When you have all I want to have squid ink spaghetti. Is that because of me? Be honest time to find out. Hey

02:46:12.400 --> 02:46:15.680
Stroney, you didn't have she be you didn't hear she be the discussion about

02:46:16.640 --> 02:46:21.280
No, actually this is one thing that I'm actually genuinely a bit sad about

02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:23.840
Because I stream so much

02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:29.840
I don't have time to watch everyone's streams and it ups it like it genuinely upsets me

02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:31.280
like

02:46:31.280 --> 02:46:32.240
um

02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:36.640
I raided into mercy yesterday and she was playing oh mario

02:46:37.600 --> 02:46:40.800
Or whatever the name of the game is. Oh, I've never seen it or played it before

02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:45.440
And um, she was like yapping quite adorably

02:46:46.160 --> 02:46:48.320
But I just feel bad that like I don't have time like

02:46:49.120 --> 02:46:54.640
Just everything like when I popped into ac stream playing that puzzle game. Obviously she be live right now

02:46:55.040 --> 02:46:57.120
I have terrible news, but I don't have she be

02:46:58.080 --> 02:47:02.960
In my ear right now that you guys can't hear whilst I game and stream and talk at the same time

02:47:02.960 --> 02:47:07.600
It's just not possible for me. I did not remember this map at all. I'm like, um

02:47:10.240 --> 02:47:12.560
Let's go for it. Let's see what this maps all about then

02:47:13.520 --> 02:47:19.840
What is this is this a run through type of thing?

02:47:22.800 --> 02:47:24.800
Uh, no, this is a search

02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:30.480
What is going on? Whoa, this is pretty

02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:39.360
What is going on I need to learn to do that protection spell more wait

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:44.240
Why did the area just moved wait, so am I supposed to kill who's in the area?

02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:46.560
Let's go

02:47:46.560 --> 02:47:50.240
Let's see. Yeah, it's kind of shame that all your streams are overlapping

02:47:50.640 --> 02:47:56.480
I will say one thing I did ask the girls to push on the first week to stream as much as possible

02:47:56.720 --> 02:48:01.120
However, um, some of them are going to settle into streaming. Um,

02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:06.800
I literally said to them do not even dare stream every single day

02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:09.280
After this like you will be taking breaks

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:13.760
That like I was I've lit and they can all vouch that I told them straight to their

02:48:14.240 --> 02:48:20.000
Faces don't you dare stream every single day? The only reason I can do it is because I don't experience

02:48:20.640 --> 02:48:26.480
Burnout the only reason I would not stream is if I am on desk store. I'm not even kidding. Um

02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:33.120
Oh, that horse is beating me up. They're jumping me. Wait use the ultimate use the heal heal heal. My goodness

02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:35.520
You're so so what am I supposed to do here?

02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:39.280
Stop

02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:46.240
I'm gonna need to take these I'm getting hurt by something. Um

02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:51.760
What I might get hurt by

02:48:52.960 --> 02:48:54.560
I'm no idea

02:48:54.560 --> 02:48:58.400
Right. Wait. Why am I just to run around these sectors or just

02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:03.760
Stop it. Oh, there's more of them here. I need to kill

02:49:04.720 --> 02:49:06.720
Are you forcing them to take breaks?

02:49:07.200 --> 02:49:10.720
I'm not going to tell them not to stream because that's not my place to do that

02:49:11.360 --> 02:49:16.800
But I will be worried if as time goes on like

02:49:17.600 --> 02:49:19.920
I've noticed one of them are like non-stop streaming

02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:27.840
But I will always like take their like if they say they're fine, I'm not going to question it

02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:30.880
I'm not I'm absolutely not going to question it if they want to stream they can stream

02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:34.560
But I would be a bit worried like hopefully, you're not like overdone

02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:40.080
Because when I do it, it's fine. But when others do it, hold on a minute. I'm getting worried. I'm

02:49:40.720 --> 02:49:44.480
I'm turning in a mother mode. Like, are you okay? Uh, is there something I could help you with?

02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:47.040
Is there like a reason behind the scenes why you want to stream everything?

02:49:48.080 --> 02:49:50.080
You know, I just want to make sure you're okay, baby. Okay

02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:53.200
You're my wing. You're my wing

02:49:53.600 --> 02:49:55.600
Oh my goodness

02:49:55.680 --> 02:49:58.400
Uh, you literally just stopped me from doing that ultimate

02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:01.120
Okay, objective quickly

02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:06.720
Take care of your daughters. Yes

02:50:07.200 --> 02:50:12.640
Uh, unironically, I've been getting nightmares about my daughters. Um, I had a nightmare

02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:15.520
That I didn't

02:50:15.840 --> 02:50:19.680
redirect into one of them and then they wanted to leave real or because of that

02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:23.520
And I literally put in the message. I was like, am I real mommy now?

02:50:23.600 --> 02:50:29.840
Without her many because I'm like, I'm literally having nightmares like of like, oh no, something's not going right

02:50:30.400 --> 02:50:32.400
Or like I've done something wrong

02:50:32.880 --> 02:50:34.560
Are we babies?

02:50:34.560 --> 02:50:36.560
Here we go

02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:38.560
Well, like, uh, I

02:50:38.960 --> 02:50:40.960
I managed to get streaming

02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:43.760
No streaming detachment anxiety

02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:47.920
That's not the word is it? What way am I supposed to go this way? Um

02:50:49.440 --> 02:50:51.680
Separation anxiety from the reefing

02:50:52.480 --> 02:50:54.480
Um, that happened

02:50:55.120 --> 02:50:58.640
And I don't know if I'm gonna develop it again for a little bit

02:50:59.280 --> 02:51:01.280
Uh, plausible

02:51:01.760 --> 02:51:06.000
But it's happened with the girls where when I go to sleep I get so nervous

02:51:06.720 --> 02:51:11.280
For them and like I'm worried like something might happen to them and I'm not there to like help them through it or something

02:51:11.920 --> 02:51:17.200
Um, help me return to but yeah yesterday was weird going after the two hour mark

02:51:17.200 --> 02:51:21.120
There was so much time in the day, but the good news is I got a lot behind the scenes work done

02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:23.280
Wait

02:51:28.640 --> 02:51:33.920
Uh, I may or may not blast through that dialogue and I don't know a match is for her

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
Mr. Horsey that was me twat

02:51:42.240 --> 02:51:46.240
Wait, what? Oh fucking spank you today. What are you playing at?

02:51:46.240 --> 02:51:48.240
Oh

02:51:49.200 --> 02:51:50.560
Protection

02:51:50.560 --> 02:51:53.600
Where's the other guy? I literally just saw him or did I just get them both in the goal?

02:51:54.160 --> 02:51:58.480
I assume I'm gonna score in her too. Yeah, okay. This is like an escort mission if I've ever seen one

02:52:01.200 --> 02:52:03.200
Does she attack or does she not attack?

02:52:04.240 --> 02:52:09.840
No, she just stands there and lets me do everything. All right, Hannah see have it and lazy bum

02:52:10.800 --> 02:52:17.600
Lazy bum lazy bum. That's right. I'm calling you a lazy bum. What you gonna do better? Oh, I love that one hit like fly by

02:52:19.760 --> 02:52:26.560
I swear and those it wasn't thing in the movies. No, it definitely is not. Is she getting attacked? No, she's fine

02:52:30.080 --> 02:52:32.080
She is getting attacked

02:52:40.240 --> 02:52:43.520
Uh, right we can progress to the next person

02:52:44.160 --> 02:52:46.160
I'm very caring mama honestly

02:52:46.960 --> 02:52:48.960
She's got worries. I'm like

02:52:49.120 --> 02:52:51.600
I remember my mom telling me when she had me

02:52:52.160 --> 02:52:56.080
She used to be a deep sleeper, but when I was born she became a late sleeper

02:52:56.800 --> 02:53:01.680
And I'm like I I feel that because I've not had like a really good night sleep since debut

02:53:01.760 --> 02:53:04.320
Oh before debut. I didn't even have a good sleep either

02:53:05.600 --> 02:53:09.600
And the yap is the best part also in general a really cute thing for

02:53:09.840 --> 02:53:11.520
now is that

02:53:11.520 --> 02:53:15.520
They are yapping a lot, but not in a bad way. No, I love when the girls yap honestly

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.800
It's like so nice to listen to like their stories and

02:53:19.440 --> 02:53:23.760
And the situations have been in they've been in like quite humorous situations. Um

02:53:25.680 --> 02:53:27.840
And it's just like fun to hear different

02:53:28.480 --> 02:53:33.840
People talk from like different walks of life. Like I know that sounds so freaking weird to say

02:53:34.480 --> 02:53:35.520
but like

02:53:35.520 --> 02:53:36.720
um

02:53:36.720 --> 02:53:41.120
It's just fascinating and it just I just I just I just made it fascinating

02:53:41.120 --> 02:53:44.160
I feel like you can also learn a lot from people's stories as well

02:53:44.480 --> 02:53:48.240
Even if it's a humorous story, normally there's some sort of like thing

02:53:48.720 --> 02:53:53.120
Or element where they can look back and giggle and be like, oh, I wouldn't have done that now

02:53:53.200 --> 02:53:57.520
But like oh, isn't it funny at the time and like, you know, just a little good things

02:53:57.600 --> 02:54:01.280
I should maybe do a reef link story time where we share stories

02:54:01.760 --> 02:54:05.440
And it'll be like sure like I would be have to be like a google submission thing

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
And it's like oh share your

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
um

02:54:10.560 --> 02:54:16.240
Share like a memory that makes you embarrassed and like I'll read them out and then I'll share you an embarrassing story of mine

02:54:16.640 --> 02:54:18.080
um

02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:20.240
Like that kind of stuff I would absolutely love to do

02:54:20.240 --> 02:54:24.880
I feel like those kind of interactive streams are quite funny and we can all like kind of have a week giggle at each other

02:54:25.360 --> 02:54:28.480
Also, you guys must remind me to brush my teeth at the end of the stream

02:54:29.120 --> 02:54:32.000
I keep forgetting to brush my teeth

02:54:32.880 --> 02:54:34.880
for that guy and

02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:36.800
Um

02:54:36.800 --> 02:54:40.640
We need to do it together for 21 days so we can establish

02:54:41.760 --> 02:54:43.760
our beautiful training

02:54:44.880 --> 02:54:46.880
Yes

02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:53.680
Hello rocks village behind village the shards are behind honestly me speaking french

02:54:54.640 --> 02:54:56.640
rocks

02:54:56.800 --> 02:55:00.320
Go I did I forgot what behind is dead air

02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:03.680
The village no

02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:08.640
Dead air will and then rock is probably just like l rock

02:55:10.320 --> 02:55:11.520
Rock

02:55:11.520 --> 02:55:13.520
Al

02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:15.920
I think there's not a will stand below

02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:25.920
Or is this a fate is this a fate or it's a fate it's on peer protection

02:55:26.880 --> 02:55:29.380
I'm literally a warlock peer protection

02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:34.160
Oh, we don't like fire fire bad

02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:37.600
Oh get rekt

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:39.440
Get rekt

02:55:39.440 --> 02:55:41.440
Get rekt. I'm getting rekt. I'm getting rekt by the

02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:47.200
I leveled up though, but I'm currently getting absolutely you can literally see the ammo shot

02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:51.360
That is coming from me from that freaking thing. Oh unlock new armor. Whoa

02:55:52.240 --> 02:55:54.240
I'm naked

02:55:55.040 --> 02:55:57.600
Is that less protection? Oh, no, it's the exact same

02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:03.920
Well, if it's the same as the green one, yeah, we'll just use it. Um, oh my god, I'm a

02:56:05.280 --> 02:56:06.640
Bro

02:56:06.640 --> 02:56:07.840
You're

02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:14.640
Reload or something. Jeez get me out of here. I'm just gonna run ahead. Oh having invis as well right. We'll do invis

02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:20.080
Try to speak because I saw something

02:56:20.960 --> 02:56:25.200
Literally I was green a minute ago with my armor and then it all disappeared and I'm like, excuse me

02:56:25.280 --> 02:56:27.280
Where's my uh protection via armor?

02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:30.960
Like you're telling me the navi still haven't figured out that uh, maybe we should

02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:36.400
Literally have bullets or getting thrown and you're telling me the navi haven't figured out that we should probably

02:56:37.760 --> 02:56:43.280
There is much they say you can do uh, I can do is they're a shard nearby. I'm going to drink a water

02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:45.280
You should think about how you think

02:56:46.320 --> 02:56:50.800
You must help we were attacked by humans. Many have died

02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:59.360
You are not too late go find Alona when he can help and Mercy says

02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:05.600
Uh, I'm sorry. I've accidentally stumbled into the algorithm on twitter and I'm like congrats because I don't know how that heck

02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:12.640
It works either. Uh, and a lot has been you to find all low new in in the village of to the east

02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:16.800
The red feathers look pretty bad

02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:21.760
Where are we going? Oh a bit of a bit of a walk. Oh, no, no not a bit of a walk

02:57:22.560 --> 02:57:24.560
Because there's a horsey horsey

02:57:25.440 --> 02:57:27.440
easy there

02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:35.520
Would you let me read you and say easy there like this dire horse from the hit video game james karmann's avatar released in

02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:38.160
2009

02:57:41.360 --> 02:57:46.640
How many resurrections do I have I've actually not been collecting much samples does that attack me or you friend

02:57:47.520 --> 02:57:49.520
Oh

02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:51.760
Well, that got answered real quick, didn't it?

02:57:53.120 --> 02:57:55.120
Whoa

02:57:57.680 --> 02:58:00.160
Bit too much action on these roads for me

02:58:01.040 --> 02:58:04.400
Bit too much my only I would say my only complaint about this game

02:58:05.440 --> 02:58:11.920
Is that you can never freely explore the land like things constantly keep respawning which I'm not a fan of

02:58:11.920 --> 02:58:14.960
I quite like the idea of like clearing out an area and then it's like faith

02:58:15.840 --> 02:58:18.960
Every time you like want to come back. We're gonna unlock the tree of vision

02:58:21.280 --> 02:58:23.280
This game

02:58:23.600 --> 02:58:26.400
Well, this game did become PlayStation Platinum. Um

02:58:27.680 --> 02:58:32.240
Uh, apparently there's a multiplayer mode in this game. I don't ever recall playing that as a child

02:58:35.520 --> 02:58:38.800
So surrounding when is the history stream of yapping about the Irish potato family?

02:58:39.120 --> 02:58:41.120
I don't know

02:58:41.360 --> 02:58:44.880
I was going to do a teacher's day where we have like 40 minute

02:58:45.200 --> 02:58:47.200
Or well, maybe 30 minute classes

02:58:47.440 --> 02:58:53.120
So we do like English study and then we do like a french class and then we'll do like a pee class

02:58:53.840 --> 02:58:59.840
And we're like literally I'll just instruct you on what we're supposed to do and you'll just hear me jump up and down in my room

02:59:00.320 --> 02:59:02.320
um

02:59:02.720 --> 02:59:08.160
Um other we'll do mass as well. I'll teach board mass is how we do it in

02:59:09.680 --> 02:59:14.880
The UK or maybe maybe just Scotland. I don't know. Uh, board mass is brackets of division

02:59:15.600 --> 02:59:20.720
multiplication addition subtraction is different what the heck am I supposed to do? I wasn't paying attention

02:59:21.920 --> 02:59:26.400
I think I'm supposed to collect things in this area. Yes. I am. I am slight things in this area

02:59:27.040 --> 02:59:29.040
If that's the case in viz right now

02:59:30.720 --> 02:59:36.160
Right, we'll just do the outskirts of the area because I think that kind of highlights what the dealie was

02:59:36.240 --> 02:59:38.240
Where the heck

02:59:40.320 --> 02:59:42.960
Uh, right there's one

02:59:45.280 --> 02:59:49.040
I can hear lots of enemies, but I'm trying not to engage in any of them

02:59:50.160 --> 02:59:55.920
I am gonna get him to not attack me by doing this. Nope. That was not

02:59:56.880 --> 03:00:00.800
That wasn't it. Oopsies literally just aggro time on me for no reason. Oh, there is

03:00:01.520 --> 03:00:04.720
We need one more pink tentacle

03:00:07.120 --> 03:00:09.120
Oh

03:00:09.440 --> 03:00:11.920
Oh, there is there is right. We're safe safe safe safe

03:00:13.360 --> 03:00:15.360
To ease

03:00:15.920 --> 03:00:18.800
We're gonna try and avoid all the fights because you really do

03:00:19.280 --> 03:00:23.840
Once you do like if you engage in all the fights you really do get like tangled up in like all this time

03:00:24.480 --> 03:00:26.800
Strongly teaching man, and it's not gonna go well

03:00:27.360 --> 03:00:32.320
But like we would do all the most basic covers like we do biology we'll do physics we'll do chemistry

03:00:32.800 --> 03:00:38.800
And like a full day and the way I was going to do it is we're not allowed to progress until you guys actually give me the

03:00:38.800 --> 03:00:40.000
Correct answer

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:43.920
So depending on how fast you do it, we'll get through the school day like really fast

03:00:44.560 --> 03:00:48.640
But like I'll put a little teak. I don't know if I can get looking teachers. I don't know

03:00:49.920 --> 03:00:51.920
Maybe put like a graduation cap

03:00:53.040 --> 03:00:57.840
Oh, wait, hold on. I just realized I'm not gonna light on I think that's why my mouth track is being all funny. Hold on

03:00:58.320 --> 03:01:00.320
Hold on professional streamer moment. Oh

03:01:02.320 --> 03:01:04.320
Oh

03:01:05.840 --> 03:01:06.800
There we go

03:01:06.800 --> 03:01:10.480
Right, I'm gonna recalibrate just because I keep seeing my mouth is kind of like wiggling away

03:01:10.800 --> 03:01:14.560
I assure you I'm not about to cry, you know when someone's about to cry and their mouth starts wiggling

03:01:14.800 --> 03:01:16.800
That's what I do anyway

03:01:17.040 --> 03:01:21.440
But we will recalibrate a little cheeky recalibration

03:01:22.240 --> 03:01:26.720
Nope, and uh, my blanket is currently trapped around the microphone. That's not fair

03:01:27.440 --> 03:01:29.840
Mr. Blanket, please please work with me here

03:01:29.920 --> 03:01:31.920
Oh

03:01:32.160 --> 03:01:36.080
Your math phobia, I hope you don't have a math phobia numbers. Oh

03:01:38.400 --> 03:01:45.440
So I was calibrating so I had to go into that silent. It's like, oh you scared the numbers. Oh multiplication. Oh

03:01:46.640 --> 03:01:49.920
Yeah, that terrify you that stuff made out of nightmares for you. Yeah

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.240
Where's these horses? Let's go

03:02:00.160 --> 03:02:07.520
You could give a history lesson on the battle of bannock born. I absolutely will we'll do we'll have a scottish lessons stream

03:02:09.360 --> 03:02:12.800
Segment for it because if we're going to study english, literally

03:02:13.520 --> 03:02:18.800
Then I'm gonna stay off the horse for this. I think I'm just picking these people up horse. You're in my way. Thank you

03:02:19.680 --> 03:02:21.680
Reunite the hunters

03:02:26.080 --> 03:02:28.720
That's all I really had to do

03:02:30.800 --> 03:02:32.800
Well, we'll just

03:02:35.280 --> 03:02:41.280
I'll just let them fight in the background whilst i'm in a cut scene. Don't worry guys. You're doing fine. Keep it up. No, you're fine

03:02:41.680 --> 03:02:43.680
You're fine. You're doing fine

03:02:44.560 --> 03:02:46.560
What's your favorite protest?

03:02:47.920 --> 03:02:50.080
What does that mean? What's her protest?

03:02:51.920 --> 03:02:53.920
I don't know what a protest is

03:02:54.640 --> 03:02:58.720
Oh my god a veiler group calibration with the math because apparently all of you struggle with math

03:02:59.600 --> 03:03:00.880
literally

03:03:00.880 --> 03:03:07.280
I like playing incremental games, but you know, I don't actually like doing the thinking part when it comes to numbers

03:03:08.320 --> 03:03:10.320
So, yeah

03:03:16.320 --> 03:03:24.480
Yes, this is correct. This is the way to victory to victory to victory. This is the way to victory and this is the way we'll go

03:03:24.720 --> 03:03:26.720
Hmm

03:03:28.240 --> 03:03:30.240
I'm actually so fast on this

03:03:30.880 --> 03:03:35.600
Is this faster than the Thanator? It actually might be, you know, oh, there's so many samples around here

03:03:35.680 --> 03:03:40.560
I'm just gonna check. Oh, I'm actually max on revives. I've got five revives

03:03:41.360 --> 03:03:47.760
Oh, we're getting ready to attack. I can see you. You have done much for my clan. We stand beside you

03:03:48.720 --> 03:03:51.680
Even Shibi was struggling with the puzzle. Oh puzzle games are

03:03:52.240 --> 03:03:54.240
Hmm

03:03:54.960 --> 03:03:58.320
I asked Emmy and AC see if they would maybe collab on

03:03:59.520 --> 03:04:01.520
We were here that puzzle game

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:03.280
And they had to swap the game

03:04:03.280 --> 03:04:08.320
They gave it a little short like just as a five 15 minute practice and they were like we're not playing that and I was that's fine

03:04:08.320 --> 03:04:14.240
That's fine. You don't have to play a spine. He's fine. I wanted to see if I could do it with a wiefling

03:04:15.920 --> 03:04:20.080
But then I would have to like if I could do it

03:04:20.400 --> 03:04:21.440
Oh

03:04:21.440 --> 03:04:27.760
Yeah, they wonder the rock killed me. It's sort of a fucking entire boulder on my skull. Are you joking?

03:04:28.160 --> 03:04:30.400
How is that supposed to know that was about to happen?

03:04:31.600 --> 03:04:35.360
That's outrageous. Oh map design change. What's in here?

03:04:36.560 --> 03:04:38.560
Enemies got a lot of oh

03:04:39.200 --> 03:04:41.200
Can can you guys really not see?

03:04:41.920 --> 03:04:43.920
Oh

03:04:47.200 --> 03:04:50.720
Right, okay, I give up I give up that's really annoying

03:04:52.560 --> 03:04:54.560
What's going on here?

03:04:54.960 --> 03:04:57.440
I've done protection. I've got knocked back

03:04:57.440 --> 03:05:01.200
I hate when they knock you back because that's when you can just absolutely eat

03:05:01.840 --> 03:05:03.840
All of the damage that they're laying out

03:05:04.880 --> 03:05:06.880
Which is not good

03:05:07.760 --> 03:05:10.880
Yeah, like I'm literally getting so injured

03:05:11.200 --> 03:05:13.200
Oh

03:05:13.440 --> 03:05:15.440
This your spawn point is it behind here?

03:05:16.160 --> 03:05:17.440
You suck

03:05:17.440 --> 03:05:19.600
Get rid of that spawn point get that spawn point out here

03:05:20.480 --> 03:05:23.200
We're straight ahead. Oh, we're just like literally going back

03:05:29.440 --> 03:05:31.440
Could you do a lesson on maricuna scots?

03:05:32.160 --> 03:05:33.760
honestly

03:05:33.760 --> 03:05:35.760
Oh my god. I have to make you do force

03:05:36.640 --> 03:05:42.640
Force peak re religious education as well. Actually, maybe not. I may not be that fun for what people

03:05:44.640 --> 03:05:46.640
I'll make us sing a song

03:05:58.480 --> 03:06:01.760
Force choir, I'll have to get us all to sing at the same time

03:06:02.240 --> 03:06:07.280
But it has to be it has to be like internet culture songs because it's fun. Why are we why did

03:06:08.160 --> 03:06:12.320
Why did he just oh, there's a dog there but a doll dog with a book?

03:06:12.960 --> 03:06:14.400
um

03:06:14.400 --> 03:06:18.720
I don't know what songs I could make us sing it would have to be related to

03:06:20.320 --> 03:06:24.240
Meme culture. What did you guys think about all the songs that made the girls sing?

03:06:26.320 --> 03:06:28.320
I freaking

03:06:29.040 --> 03:06:31.040
I

03:06:31.360 --> 03:06:35.520
How am I supposed to avoid that? I'm sorry. There's absolutely no way you can dodge that

03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:39.840
Unless you went to attack but if you am I am I going the wrong way?

03:06:44.320 --> 03:06:46.320
I've gone horrifically the wrong way

03:06:46.640 --> 03:06:53.360
Uh, sorry, I had to like really think there. I think I'm actually about to lose my dire horse coming back here because of this car

03:06:54.640 --> 03:06:56.320
Yeah, wow

03:06:56.320 --> 03:06:57.600
literally

03:06:57.680 --> 03:07:04.960
Brian what if the more games show with the girls where every stream the questions are about a different subject eyes

03:07:07.280 --> 03:07:12.080
Hold on. I'm getting absolutely right. Hold on protection and biz. Let's go. Oh and biz

03:07:13.440 --> 03:07:19.200
Sorry, right. Hold on narrow. Thank you for the tip. Hey, Shawnee. What if veal or game show with the girls where every

03:07:19.520 --> 03:07:23.920
Stream the questions are about a different. I don't know that. Sorry. I can't do two things at once. Hold on. Hold on

03:07:24.720 --> 03:07:27.120
What way to go stick to this one?

03:07:28.240 --> 03:07:30.240
Oh

03:07:30.480 --> 03:07:36.240
I'm no I'm no I'm no smart enough to do two things at once. I'm gonna have to read that all over again one more time. Take it from the top

03:07:37.200 --> 03:07:42.800
Hey, Shawnee. Why is there more enemies? What if veal or game show with the girls where they stream the question?

03:07:42.800 --> 03:07:47.520
There are different there the questions are every so we do have one game show

03:07:48.080 --> 03:07:52.240
Coming up that I'm gonna make I am going to reach out to a

03:07:52.960 --> 03:07:54.960
creator

03:07:56.320 --> 03:08:00.880
For possibly they already do a game show, but I was gonna set it up for them

03:08:00.960 --> 03:08:03.760
So literally they can just rack in all the money

03:08:04.400 --> 03:08:08.400
If you didn't know the easiest way to collab with people is to do all the work

03:08:08.480 --> 03:08:12.480
But let them like take over type thing. It's the most like

03:08:13.360 --> 03:08:15.360
likely way that

03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:21.600
Collab opportunities will be accepted. So I've got possibly a game show that we're going to show up on someone else's channel

03:08:22.560 --> 03:08:25.680
And and then I'll get like a highlight reel made

03:08:26.480 --> 03:08:28.480
and

03:08:28.480 --> 03:08:32.320
So I need to reach out to another creator, but I'm letting this first week settle down

03:08:32.400 --> 03:08:35.440
Like it's been a bit hectic like trying to get a script manager in place

03:08:35.920 --> 03:08:39.920
And we're trying to deal with this clipping issue that we've kind of already know

03:08:40.320 --> 03:08:45.680
Things are a bit slow to be produced, but the girls are gonna have shorts that come out consistently

03:08:46.400 --> 03:08:48.400
on their channels at some point

03:08:50.400 --> 03:08:52.400
But like me and she be are literally lagging

03:08:53.200 --> 03:08:55.200
for shorts because

03:08:56.400 --> 03:09:00.960
I'm waiting to get us monetized first before we start putting shorts out

03:09:01.360 --> 03:09:06.080
Because this is just a fact but shorts do better if there's something in them. That's a bit

03:09:06.880 --> 03:09:08.880
humorous in that way

03:09:10.400 --> 03:09:14.640
And the one that I got she be to do that a fauna speedrun challenge

03:09:14.800 --> 03:09:17.040
Like that did well and all and I actually really

03:09:17.760 --> 03:09:22.320
She got to show off her mine like a voice, which is absolutely perfect. Um

03:09:24.080 --> 03:09:28.400
But um the other ones I actually got her to discuss

03:09:31.520 --> 03:09:33.520
Milf body type v-tubers

03:09:34.080 --> 03:09:38.800
Um, which I thought was super interesting, but I'm too scared to put it up

03:09:39.600 --> 03:09:45.920
Right now because I would be mortified if the girls didn't get accepted for monetization

03:09:46.960 --> 03:09:53.040
And this recent ASMR stuff. Jeez. I'm literally getting grenade launched. My goodness

03:09:53.760 --> 03:09:58.320
Draw destroy the amp soup. Well, okay. I was gonna say where is it? Um

03:09:59.840 --> 03:10:05.520
But there will be a lot of shorts coming up like one monetization is freaking dealt with

03:10:06.080 --> 03:10:07.840
Uh

03:10:07.840 --> 03:10:12.880
Because the stats updated but it only updated halfway through debut

03:10:13.200 --> 03:10:16.480
So it says I still haven't reached watch hours even though

03:10:16.640 --> 03:10:18.640
I think I have like a

03:10:18.880 --> 03:10:22.960
Stupendous amount of watch hours now, especially after that assassins creed my

03:10:23.920 --> 03:10:29.360
Assassin's Creed brother you'd stream almost has more views than my debut stream

03:10:29.440 --> 03:10:34.880
Which is hilarious to think about because I streamed for so long and I guess people just didn't expect it

03:10:34.880 --> 03:10:37.360
So like they came back in the stream twice at some point

03:10:38.240 --> 03:10:40.240
You made 20 hours in two days

03:10:41.280 --> 03:10:46.640
Literally like but after debut we all successfully had enough watch time at that point

03:10:46.880 --> 03:10:50.160
It's just youtube has taken an entire week to update and today

03:10:50.320 --> 03:10:53.600
I was supposed to be able to apply everyone's channel for monetization

03:10:54.160 --> 03:11:00.800
But it only partially updated the thing. I think it's faster if

03:11:01.600 --> 03:11:02.960
I

03:11:03.440 --> 03:11:05.920
No, I just jumped down on this bridge that comes up. Um

03:11:06.480 --> 03:11:08.480
But I only did it halfway through debut

03:11:08.560 --> 03:11:14.480
So I need to wait another 24 hours for it to update and then I can submit all the girls channels

03:11:14.720 --> 03:11:16.560
um

03:11:16.560 --> 03:11:20.240
Like I've got an ASMR short of sheebie as well

03:11:20.720 --> 03:11:24.720
But azure's short got denied for monetization

03:11:25.360 --> 03:11:32.160
For advertisement and I think it's literally because her voice is just too strong. Like I don't know how

03:11:32.880 --> 03:11:39.920
But her her voice is too strong. It needs nerf. Oh, I really don't want to go down if that's there. Can I destroy this?

03:11:42.080 --> 03:11:44.000
Hold on

03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:46.000
Did I just snake him out of that car?

03:11:49.360 --> 03:11:51.360
Did that car just disappear?

03:11:52.160 --> 03:11:56.720
I'm just going to invis through this section, but that looks like I snaked him out of that car

03:11:57.360 --> 03:11:59.360
No, I clearly didn't because he's right there

03:12:02.800 --> 03:12:04.800
You don't hear anything that's called

03:12:05.360 --> 03:12:07.360
Uh, the ai cheating

03:12:07.600 --> 03:12:09.600
What's this a bomb?

03:12:09.600 --> 03:12:11.600
Oh a bomb

03:12:13.440 --> 03:12:20.320
Oh a bomb. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. There's far too many of you right now. There's far too many of you right now

03:12:21.840 --> 03:12:26.160
Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I've done it now. I've done it now. I've done it now. I've done it now

03:12:26.400 --> 03:12:30.080
Come it. Come it. Come it. Come it. Come it. Come it. Come it quick. Quick. Quick. foot

03:12:31.040 --> 03:12:33.280
Where's the other one? Where's the other one? There's one more in here

03:12:33.760 --> 03:12:35.760
There is I see it. I see it. I see it.� I see it.

03:12:35.760 --> 03:12:37.760
You can do this we can do this as long as I do it

03:12:38.320 --> 03:12:41.600
I'll hit a checkpoint right. Get me that heck out here. Oh

03:12:42.480 --> 03:12:46.240
I don't have heal yet. I don't have heal yet a face of maneuvers a face of maneuvers

03:12:46.540 --> 03:12:50.400
A face, I have a heal, I have a heal, I have a heal I have a heal. I have heal

03:12:51.360 --> 03:12:53.360
What's going on? Why?

03:12:53.520 --> 03:12:55.360
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay

03:12:55.360 --> 03:12:59.600
okay get on the horse get on the horse get on the horse get on the horse got

03:12:59.600 --> 03:13:01.680
am i on the wrong side

03:13:03.480 --> 03:13:07.360
if i go this way i can teleport to that other one and then go from there

03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:09.080
yes we will do that

03:13:09.080 --> 03:13:10.800
aww no there's another one of these

03:13:10.800 --> 03:13:13.620
oh my gosh they're so pee

03:13:15.360 --> 03:13:17.120
goodness gravy

03:13:17.520 --> 03:13:18.800
what does that even mean

03:13:19.360 --> 03:13:22.480
how ... literally i think it's because

03:13:22.480 --> 03:13:34.240
very sadly sheepsters and Azura might have a cover-up for their... I don't know

03:13:34.240 --> 03:13:38.080
I don't know I don't know what's going on we're kind of we're at the question mark

03:13:38.080 --> 03:13:43.920
stage of what's the problem what's the issue but we'll get there okay

03:13:43.920 --> 03:13:47.520
did I say thank you for the tip Nero? sorry if I didn't

03:13:47.680 --> 03:13:51.680
but yes there are game show type-esque things coming up there's no horse

03:13:51.680 --> 03:13:56.960
games November is my Scottish game show

03:13:56.960 --> 03:14:00.240
I don't know if one of the girls might be interested in holding a

03:14:00.240 --> 03:14:08.000
type of VTuber collab game show I'll need to see

03:14:09.280 --> 03:14:12.240
yeah mate I was actually helping you do you mind

03:14:12.240 --> 03:14:19.200
jeez you're so rude and stinky all right I think I'm to go this way and then

03:14:19.200 --> 03:14:23.040
I'm sorry I'm getting really switched around to this freaking map

03:14:23.040 --> 03:14:26.640
but we'll just we'll go for it we'll send it

03:14:26.640 --> 03:14:30.320
ooh no thank you no thank you no thank you

03:14:30.320 --> 03:14:36.960
hehehe not interested no thank you your horses butt is soaking up all those

03:14:36.960 --> 03:14:41.440
bullets like a chat honestly staggering amount of endurance

03:14:41.440 --> 03:14:48.480
on that thing um the Easter wheels oh are they finally

03:14:48.480 --> 03:14:53.280
giving me a path with no enemies you know what I'm not speaking ever again

03:14:53.280 --> 03:14:58.160
that's ridiculous timing you've embarrassed me

03:14:58.160 --> 03:15:02.000
I would I think that's my only complaint about this game it would be so nice if

03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:05.040
there was areas that you could just enjoy for the beauty

03:15:05.040 --> 03:15:08.560
which I know this sounds like such a weird thing to say but like I really

03:15:08.560 --> 03:15:13.360
like admire the game okay I'm a little a little map design

03:15:13.360 --> 03:15:16.240
admirer and like look at how much nature there is

03:15:16.240 --> 03:15:19.600
I'm pretty sure there's actually a steam game that came out and it's all about

03:15:19.600 --> 03:15:24.000
identifying plants in nature and I'm like honestly I wish I was like more

03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:27.760
entertaining so I could play it but I'm not there

03:15:27.760 --> 03:15:30.640
B or B I gotta go somewhere okay let me just pause the stream we'll wait for you

03:15:30.640 --> 03:15:34.000
to come back

03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:36.880
see you when you come back

03:15:39.040 --> 03:15:45.360
oh it's not osha pet is it peta

03:15:45.360 --> 03:15:50.720
peta that's that animal organization

03:15:50.720 --> 03:15:55.520
peta that's not working in my head I don't think it's peta

03:15:55.600 --> 03:16:01.440
oh new armor oh check that out oh I like that hold on

03:16:01.440 --> 03:16:05.280
let's do a little wardrobe check wardrobe check oh wait whoa

03:16:05.280 --> 03:16:09.680
my mobility is way down but my protection is so up from that

03:16:09.680 --> 03:16:13.600
we might leave that up I'd rather like have more indefinite

03:16:13.600 --> 03:16:19.600
protection than having to deal with all these issues

03:16:19.600 --> 03:16:25.200
with constantly like getting barraged

03:16:25.200 --> 03:16:31.280
uh right okay crystal crystal crystal let's beat them up

03:16:31.280 --> 03:16:36.880
where's the crystal oh whoa whoa whoa steady on steady on

03:16:36.880 --> 03:16:39.520
where's the crystal

03:16:39.840 --> 03:16:46.400
I'm like literally jump-scaring these guys whoa you're on the crystal

03:16:46.400 --> 03:16:54.320
right where is it I'm staring at it oh it's up oh wow okay I would have known

03:16:54.320 --> 03:17:00.160
that it's like I was on that crystal there mission complete

03:17:00.160 --> 03:17:05.120
ow my ankles no again protection is more important

03:17:05.120 --> 03:17:12.480
uh the mobility I would say so yeah that's a big old horse ride

03:17:12.640 --> 03:17:20.800
um can I let's go wait is that that is done uh huh uh huh yeah yeah just reading

03:17:20.800 --> 03:17:24.560
the map yeah I don't know where to go I don't know where to go I don't know

03:17:24.560 --> 03:17:28.160
really turn around uh I think it would be faster if I took a teleport

03:17:28.160 --> 03:17:37.600
near this location um hello

03:17:37.680 --> 03:17:41.840
uh I have to redo the set all right okay no I just fell through the map okay

03:17:41.840 --> 03:17:46.800
classic open woman but there we go

03:17:48.080 --> 03:17:52.160
I think we're actually getting pretty close I have never done that before I

03:17:52.160 --> 03:17:55.360
guess this game I mean I did say that games have

03:17:55.360 --> 03:18:00.320
problem with the vertical stuff especially older games

03:18:00.320 --> 03:18:03.680
when it comes to mapping you you just fall through the map so many time in

03:18:03.680 --> 03:18:09.760
older games right we are gonna teleport

03:18:09.840 --> 03:18:16.400
where it looks like that and then just take a weird straight ahead

03:18:16.400 --> 03:18:23.760
what a strange layout for a map a skill issue honestly childhood me would

03:18:23.760 --> 03:18:31.440
never do that and yet here we are being an even worse gamer

03:18:31.440 --> 03:18:35.040
pardon me I'm doing this with baby barbs this time

03:18:35.280 --> 03:18:41.920
whoa I saw the truck I saw it wait I need to climb this

03:18:42.080 --> 03:18:47.600
I don't know oh my I don't know if I can I get away with this

03:18:47.600 --> 03:18:52.400
oh my god I can get away with it oh oh that poor horse I've just left it I'm

03:18:52.400 --> 03:18:54.960
so sorry you get to meet Ewa now hush hush your

03:18:54.960 --> 03:18:59.280
plate is over you no longer have to you can frolic in the fields in Ewa's

03:18:59.280 --> 03:19:04.320
heaven now I've just left you to perish to

03:19:04.320 --> 03:19:08.960
the RDA oh I would make the joke but I

03:19:08.960 --> 03:19:12.240
don't have any more sound effects

03:19:13.360 --> 03:19:16.880
magic your way to the other side of the map honestly

03:19:16.880 --> 03:19:21.200
a bit cheeky to climb when there's an entire tank shooting at you

03:19:21.200 --> 03:19:25.360
you're the best gamer I am especially when you rage oh no

03:19:25.360 --> 03:19:28.400
I always feel bad when I rage because I feel like it's like

03:19:28.400 --> 03:19:33.120
I like doing what I like to see and if I see like a streamer rage I'm like I'm

03:19:33.120 --> 03:19:36.960
not sure I'm finding this entertaining but if you guys like it then sure I'll

03:19:36.960 --> 03:19:39.920
tap into my ancestors rage we're almost out of here I'm

03:19:39.920 --> 03:19:44.080
literally the uh is it the orcs in Skyrim I

03:19:44.080 --> 03:19:47.920
think their special move is called ancestors

03:19:47.920 --> 03:19:52.720
ancestral's rage and it's like 10% more or berserk type thing it's like 10

03:19:52.720 --> 03:19:56.240
percent more damage what's going on here

03:19:56.240 --> 03:20:00.720
the last song right look for the thumping when bumping

03:20:00.720 --> 03:20:04.800
nope there's a fight why is there a fight I thought I just had to interact with

03:20:04.800 --> 03:20:08.720
the tree did not have to interact with the tree

03:20:09.360 --> 03:20:12.960
oh okay okay okay okay we're doing it we're doing it we're doing it we're

03:20:12.960 --> 03:20:16.000
doing it we're doing it come on let's do it before they destroy absolutely

03:20:16.000 --> 03:20:20.160
everything uh uh uh uh is it not here triangle hello

03:20:20.160 --> 03:20:25.440
triangle looking for a triangle triangle this is a triangle there we go

03:20:26.560 --> 03:20:30.080
are they gonna blow the tree up before I get the phone

03:20:30.080 --> 03:20:34.080
no the ancestral stuff was done man uh berserkers rage is the one that works

03:20:34.080 --> 03:20:36.480
out ah

03:20:36.480 --> 03:20:40.960
uh right invisible because we're not out here trying to have a billion battles

03:20:40.960 --> 03:20:45.200
every two seconds yeah probably feedback on the game

03:20:45.200 --> 03:20:48.400
kind of calm down on how many enemies you put on the map because they are

03:20:48.400 --> 03:20:54.240
constant hello barrier did this did this game really say go

03:20:54.240 --> 03:20:58.000
round no way this game just say go around

03:20:58.000 --> 03:21:01.920
oh no it's fine it's fine it's fine

03:21:01.920 --> 03:21:07.360
it's fine you have some yes yes let's get out of here this place is going to

03:21:07.360 --> 03:21:10.800
blow oh we must return to kello draw take your

03:21:10.800 --> 03:21:14.800
ecrane we ride to home tree okay we go

03:21:14.800 --> 03:21:18.800
to home tree home tree

03:21:23.360 --> 03:21:27.040
I think we're getting there I can't really recall how much more to the campaign

03:21:27.120 --> 03:21:33.120
there is this would be three songs and if we're playing the classic video game

03:21:33.120 --> 03:21:41.680
rule uh I can't remember what comes after the third song

03:21:41.680 --> 03:21:48.080
I swear if it's like go for another song on my right wrap it up wrap up wrap up

03:21:48.080 --> 03:21:50.720
you're taking a bit too long now take a bit too long we're gonna need to do

03:21:50.720 --> 03:21:53.760
something a bit more than home questing but look at kill that armor looks

03:21:53.760 --> 03:21:57.120
honestly that's pretty thick

03:21:57.200 --> 03:22:02.000
it would be so cool to see this game remastered but I do not think it sold

03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:06.080
well I think it hardly did it it's numerals

03:22:06.080 --> 03:22:15.760
hello we love James Cameron you did it again

03:22:15.760 --> 03:22:23.120
is it snowing no winter in Australia

03:22:23.120 --> 03:22:28.800
is and so just fake it never goes below freezing

03:22:28.800 --> 03:22:32.480
the song yes yes the song the song a was song

03:22:32.480 --> 03:22:36.240
please be the last song no more singing

03:22:42.160 --> 03:22:47.520
tells where it is please no more songs surely we know what's up many of the

03:22:47.520 --> 03:22:51.040
people believe in you yet some fear the

03:22:51.280 --> 03:22:55.920
cute spirit inside you let me get bed ammo

03:22:55.920 --> 03:23:01.520
he blames you for much there was just a whole missing voice line I think

03:23:01.520 --> 03:23:05.360
it was so hard to come to our realization

03:23:05.360 --> 03:23:12.640
that Christmas is summer final song it's not natural but

03:23:12.640 --> 03:23:16.640
it's a pretty decided once I wrap up a business

03:23:16.720 --> 03:23:20.480
that I am going back so you must gather

03:23:20.480 --> 03:23:25.520
walk with care bed ammo yeah if you ever went to open up a business in the UK

03:23:29.360 --> 03:23:33.840

03:23:33.840 --> 03:23:39.440
entrepreneur tips like and subscribe

03:23:39.440 --> 03:23:42.800
sharpens his spear

03:23:42.800 --> 03:23:46.720
tangela wants you to fly to a new location I

03:23:46.720 --> 03:23:54.000
don't know what this I'm afraid my memory is getting very hazy now for

03:23:54.000 --> 03:23:56.400
the game

03:23:57.200 --> 03:24:02.240
you'd kill for a warm Christmas it is bizarre I did not enjoy it like I

03:24:02.240 --> 03:24:08.720
phoned my family and I was like oh I wish it was

03:24:08.720 --> 03:24:13.360
cold I wish it was cold um because you do get

03:24:13.360 --> 03:24:16.800
snowy Christmas in Scotland which is really pretty when it does happen

03:24:16.800 --> 03:24:21.280
when the stars align it's very nice

03:24:21.280 --> 03:24:27.520
hello I haven't given up where is the shot

03:24:27.520 --> 03:24:32.720
where sky machine has crashed you are so mean I've literally been helping you

03:24:32.720 --> 03:24:35.840
for ages I'm sorry but I think enough times

03:24:35.840 --> 03:24:42.560
pass where he should be alright with me and you're giving me any nonsense

03:24:42.560 --> 03:24:45.760
you make it sense to miss to go it's very beautiful where is that

03:24:45.760 --> 03:24:51.280
what the heck is this map I do not recall at all

03:24:51.280 --> 03:24:55.520
memory's getting a little bit hazy I can't see where the map ends because of

03:24:55.520 --> 03:24:58.640
that very top right corner very clearly that's where this map

03:24:58.640 --> 03:25:05.040
location ends but I don't know what happens here

03:25:05.120 --> 03:25:12.400
can't believe it right I think we're just gonna leg it as we always do

03:25:12.400 --> 03:25:16.320
but yeah like these look the map details like the

03:25:16.320 --> 03:25:21.040
kind of the further you progress the more damage the areas are and

03:25:21.040 --> 03:25:25.280
you know it was trying our hardest but like there's only

03:25:25.280 --> 03:25:30.960
only so much awa can do and the navi can do against literal bullets I have to

03:25:30.960 --> 03:25:34.080
admit bows versus bullets like I'd rather have the

03:25:34.160 --> 03:25:37.680
rather have the mp5 or the famine some way why did I get off I think I just

03:25:37.680 --> 03:25:40.800
want to activate that oh well I needed to get off anyway

03:25:40.800 --> 03:25:44.000
because I need to cut open this fence I'm itching my little

03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:47.200
what was this Elden Ring oh you've got me

03:25:47.200 --> 03:25:50.160
let's see

03:25:50.560 --> 03:25:54.880
uh we'll just avoid thank you for spawning in but

03:25:54.880 --> 03:25:57.760
not really interested me wait am I going the wrong way

03:25:57.760 --> 03:26:02.160
no I can go this way I just happened to walk right into an RDA

03:26:02.880 --> 03:26:05.360
aligned and I need to cut this fence as well

03:26:05.360 --> 03:26:08.080
get in the scraby

03:26:08.080 --> 03:26:11.440
I might make a cup of tea shortly and go for a peep because we've actually not

03:26:11.440 --> 03:26:16.640
peeped in three and a half hours of uh unless some of you guys have a

03:26:16.640 --> 03:26:20.640
detached headset and then you go for a peep

03:26:20.640 --> 03:26:26.400
whilst while still listening to the fact that there's a very high

03:26:26.400 --> 03:26:29.840
chance that a wiefling has dropped a loaf of bread while

03:26:29.920 --> 03:26:34.080
listening to me ramble on stream that's right wiefling I'm on air

03:26:34.080 --> 03:26:39.200
I know exactly what you're up to mm-hmm I know what's going on

03:26:39.200 --> 03:26:41.440
hmm

03:26:41.440 --> 03:26:45.920
a drop a loaf of bread honestly drop apparently the there's another same

03:26:45.920 --> 03:26:50.880
which is um drop the kids off at the pool

03:26:50.880 --> 03:26:57.840
which is uh guilty is charged oh no it's been confirmed

03:26:57.840 --> 03:27:01.040
you know when people say like oh what did you what what did you think would

03:27:01.040 --> 03:27:04.160
happen like when you became a beach over etc

03:27:04.160 --> 03:27:07.760
uh apparently I didn't account for someone dropping a loaf of bread to my

03:27:07.760 --> 03:27:13.920
voice so there's that yeah um yeah quite a few unique scenarios

03:27:13.920 --> 03:27:17.360
definitely definitely

03:27:19.280 --> 03:27:23.680
how are you ever like he teleports around this map for fun I swear

03:27:23.760 --> 03:27:29.840
okay hello no the shard was blown up

03:27:29.840 --> 03:27:34.880
not sure the first voice is not sure oh I'm being called the first voice I'm no

03:27:34.880 --> 03:27:38.640
longer dreamwalker oh my tummy rumbled if you heard that

03:27:38.640 --> 03:27:42.400
listen into your patreon audio we'll see in a man

03:27:42.400 --> 03:27:47.520
about horse I didn't want to miss a second to your

03:27:47.520 --> 03:27:51.280
beautiful voice though if it's any consolation

03:27:51.280 --> 03:27:55.840
you make dropping and you make dropping a loaf of bread hell of a lot more

03:27:55.840 --> 03:28:01.440
comfortable you're done you're out out you're done

03:28:02.240 --> 03:28:06.320
we would be not identifying as loaf of bread droppers

03:28:06.320 --> 03:28:11.520
oh that came out nowhere

03:28:13.760 --> 03:28:17.920
oh my poor horse I should have picked up a new one

03:28:17.920 --> 03:28:22.080
because he's so low health I want him to retire and live a happy life

03:28:22.080 --> 03:28:27.280
but I don't think that's gonna is it left or right it's this way

03:28:33.840 --> 03:28:37.920
she knows

03:28:38.640 --> 03:28:43.200
oh right I'm gonna pick up this horse here because I would like this one to

03:28:43.200 --> 03:28:46.720
literally retire and have a happy life excuse me mr horsey

03:28:46.800 --> 03:28:52.880
see you go enjoy yourself and heal up and then I'm gonna have you

03:28:52.880 --> 03:28:56.640
tada and then everyone lived happily ever after and the

03:28:56.640 --> 03:29:00.800
and everyone around me clapped yay

03:29:01.360 --> 03:29:06.160
how else are we supposed to listen to the field shoot honestly though

03:29:06.160 --> 03:29:12.800
um wow that's a lot of power

03:29:12.800 --> 03:29:17.600
a lot of manpower behind that they're destroying the crystals before we get

03:29:17.600 --> 03:29:21.520
them is someone telling them this

03:29:22.880 --> 03:29:26.800
how do they know where the heck all these crystals are

03:29:26.800 --> 03:29:31.600
right we'll finish this map and then we'll go for a tinkle and I will

03:29:31.600 --> 03:29:36.560
also go for a tinkle and make a cup of honey tea to help soothe my poor voice

03:29:36.560 --> 03:29:40.400
it's really bizarre my voice is so broken

03:29:40.400 --> 03:29:44.000
but the microphone makes it sound so like fine

03:29:44.000 --> 03:29:48.000
and not broke wait can I just teleport no I can't go fast

03:29:48.000 --> 03:29:54.480
um so I sound like pretty normal on stream

03:29:54.480 --> 03:30:01.440
my voice has been broken since uh the the violor exposed violor stream

03:30:01.440 --> 03:30:07.200
um I don't know thankfully I've managed to record a lot of stuff in advance

03:30:07.200 --> 03:30:11.440
but don't be surprised if you get a patreon audio

03:30:11.440 --> 03:30:15.440
and I'm just sound like a frog I'm like yeah you're like my good boy

03:30:15.440 --> 03:30:18.800
and you're such a good wee boy and you're like my good boy

03:30:18.800 --> 03:30:23.600
like it's getting it's getting curious it's getting curious

03:30:23.600 --> 03:30:28.240
and you are a demon how is it you live

03:30:28.240 --> 03:30:31.360
with so many honestly that's kind of a fair assumption

03:30:31.360 --> 03:30:35.200
there's something I gotta tell you we must have been

03:30:35.200 --> 03:30:40.240
those who have fallen so we attack

03:30:40.240 --> 03:30:43.760
do some patreon videos in full pantomime

03:30:43.760 --> 03:30:46.640
you get 3d models and start like mime in the axe

03:30:46.640 --> 03:30:48.640
yeah

03:30:50.400 --> 03:30:54.160
wouldn't be the first thing patreon box and audio in me

03:30:54.160 --> 03:30:58.000
a little frog voice moment you let a horse die

03:30:58.000 --> 03:31:02.240
oh it was a mistake I can't save them all but I can try my best

03:31:02.320 --> 03:31:05.600
also I just want to say I am still getting

03:31:05.600 --> 03:31:10.320
marshmallows of people asking me to save Vichu oh that horse literally just

03:31:10.320 --> 03:31:13.920
perished right before me oh where am I supposed to go

03:31:13.920 --> 03:31:17.120
uh that's quite far to go by foot but we don't really have a choice there's

03:31:17.120 --> 03:31:20.320
one more horsey horsey

03:31:24.240 --> 03:31:28.560
skull horse skull women sound really cute when their voice is

03:31:28.560 --> 03:31:32.720
cracking and squeaking from over using their giggling

03:31:32.720 --> 03:31:37.120
asking you to say what no they're they're asking me to save

03:31:37.120 --> 03:31:42.640
certain Vichubers and I said it on that stream the other day and like we're all

03:31:42.640 --> 03:31:46.880
having a giggle but I woke up and I got a few more and I'm like

03:31:46.880 --> 03:31:50.880
I don't I don't know if it's refling sending it or whatever but like I'm

03:31:50.880 --> 03:31:55.360
gonna be on it oh it's full health again and I'm gonna be honest

03:31:55.680 --> 03:32:00.160
I hope it's understandable no I can't literally save all Vichubers

03:32:00.160 --> 03:32:03.680
you know I'll try my best to look after those who have faith in me

03:32:03.680 --> 03:32:07.280
um you know I'm a big believer in reciprocation

03:32:07.280 --> 03:32:12.320
in terms of you have faith in me I have faith in you type thing

03:32:15.920 --> 03:32:21.920
well I better not am I on a timer and I don't know it

03:32:22.800 --> 03:32:25.840
I think I'm on a timer

03:32:26.400 --> 03:32:31.120
gotta go gotta go gotta go I know I know I know I know

03:32:31.120 --> 03:32:33.920
I'm trying

03:32:34.480 --> 03:32:40.000
I can unlock this uh to your vision you can lead from the front and try and

03:32:40.000 --> 03:32:45.600
change I think the content creator owned

03:32:45.600 --> 03:32:50.000
agencies definitely have a place

03:32:50.080 --> 03:32:56.080
um definitely have a place um because I think people are a bit

03:32:56.080 --> 03:33:01.680
mmm it's not for me to say what the the overall feel is but I think

03:33:01.680 --> 03:33:04.640
for me anyway it was very disappointing to learn

03:33:04.640 --> 03:33:08.480
how little creators that sign up for these agencies

03:33:08.480 --> 03:33:14.560
get in exchange for all their hard work because did he just go ahead me

03:33:14.560 --> 03:33:19.600
did he just go ahead me um hello hello human resources

03:33:19.600 --> 03:33:24.080
do you guys have human resources on pandora because um what was that

03:33:24.080 --> 03:33:26.720
excuse me

03:33:28.080 --> 03:33:31.440
uh yeah because we have very specific it's unlikely but

03:33:31.440 --> 03:33:37.680
um I did actually learn about another agency that did have a higher split than

03:33:37.680 --> 03:33:40.640
the 5050 which I'm I'm quite happy to hear about

03:33:40.640 --> 03:33:45.040
um so I think hopefully over time that 5050 split

03:33:45.040 --> 03:33:48.400
gets raised because I will tell you right now

03:33:48.400 --> 03:33:52.000
for however hard the girls work on stream it's absolutely nothing to do with

03:33:52.000 --> 03:33:54.960
me I don't tell them what to do they do it all themselves

03:33:54.960 --> 03:34:00.800
um and I believe that they should take home the lines

03:34:00.800 --> 03:34:05.280
share that's just me but not every agency that there feels like that

03:34:05.280 --> 03:34:09.440
um but if you value um if you genuinely like

03:34:09.440 --> 03:34:13.680
as a special thank you is what wait hold on I'm getting absolutely annihilated

03:34:13.680 --> 03:34:16.960
here Danny take these down I think so

03:34:16.960 --> 03:34:23.040
hold on I'm doing I cast protection where's that other one

03:34:23.200 --> 03:34:28.480
what's going on here am I just to destroy because I'll do it

03:34:28.480 --> 03:34:35.520

03:34:35.520 --> 03:34:39.360

03:35:33.760 --> 03:35:37.040
the only problem is

03:35:37.920 --> 03:35:41.680
you never know if someone wants to take advantage of you but I got very lucky

03:35:41.680 --> 03:35:45.120

03:39:10.160 --> 03:39:13.280
humans will soon realize are you telling me the navi gets steaming every

03:39:13.280 --> 03:39:17.040
weekend I'd believe it honestly

03:39:18.160 --> 03:39:21.360
I'd get a steaming with a navi not gonna lie I'd like ask them to carry me around

03:39:21.360 --> 03:39:24.480
on their backs and stuff

03:39:25.200 --> 03:39:30.800

03:40:29.840 --> 03:40:32.800
it said literally eight hours to understand

03:40:32.800 --> 03:40:40.400
now quickly um sing the final song oh but that's like such a short screen though

03:40:41.760 --> 03:40:46.400
oh I never thought this far ahead I thought it was going to be like an eight hour day

03:40:48.240 --> 03:40:52.640
I suppose the only good side if it was a short stream I can work on my ASMR then

imagine Assassin's Creed but plain as a temp yeah that's what I'm kind of like why on earth

04:04:09.280 --> 04:04:17.520
would anyone want to do the RDA but like money talks dirty cash I want you dirty cash I want you

04:04:17.520 --> 04:04:27.200
oh money talking money talking okay oh um oh camera angle steady steady right we've got one more

04:04:27.200 --> 04:04:39.520
minute isn't that a game already what game are you partly viewing about identify your topic of conversation

04:04:39.760 --> 04:04:51.360
one two three four five ultimate yeah honestly that ultimate is actually pretty sad so I'm gonna

04:04:51.360 --> 04:04:56.480
heal because it's not gonna all heal when we're not around it because the enemies keep coming back

04:04:56.480 --> 04:05:08.160
so protection oh there's a mecca over there I think oh it's out of bounds wow I just do this for now

04:05:09.760 --> 04:05:17.520
oh no no I won't someone's getting me oh maybe not maybe not the navi are actually helping hold on AI

04:05:17.520 --> 04:05:22.560
that actually attacks the enemies that are around you hold on a minute this game's 2009 and you're

04:05:22.560 --> 04:05:29.440
telling me they nailed it here and then games afterwards it's my biggest like great with video

04:05:29.440 --> 04:05:36.000
game development if you have allies that can attack but they do not actually end the enemies

04:05:36.000 --> 04:05:42.480
looking at you lego franchise looking at you and they actually don't help at all

04:05:43.440 --> 04:05:46.560
I don't know if the newest lego star wars they actually do help

04:05:48.720 --> 04:05:53.520
is she playing this because she genuinely likes it or is she as a warning to the rest of us to avoid

04:05:53.520 --> 04:06:01.920
this it's my childhood game I do like the game I'm just rubbish at it I like the navi side I've

04:06:01.920 --> 04:06:12.800
never played the RDA say whoa oh that's so cool looking I think we get to write it

04:06:15.680 --> 04:06:24.400
that's like such a cool looking dragon such a badass looking dragon and if you wanted to shorten it

04:06:24.400 --> 04:06:26.880

04:09:10.320 --> 04:09:10.800
uh

04:09:14.640 --> 04:09:18.960
was that an electricity sound are we about to lighten and bolt this thing out the sky

04:09:48.800 --> 04:09:50.800
okay question mark question mark

04:09:52.800 --> 04:09:58.560
we're saved though that's the fantastic news first voice does not need a second

04:09:59.680 --> 04:10:03.920
he really this is only the beginning tanjala more you did it

04:10:04.480 --> 04:10:11.440

04:10:15.920 --> 04:10:23.760
thunder we did it na vi na vi na vi we're the best we're the best better than the rest

04:10:23.760 --> 04:10:27.840
better than the rda let me take a little little uh drink too

04:10:28.720 --> 04:10:36.400
congrats on getting second place for na vi any percent lemo let me submit this stream for it why not

04:10:41.120 --> 04:10:47.440
another game down well uh we're gonna go for a tinkle winkle and I'm gonna make a honey tea

04:10:47.440 --> 04:10:57.120
because my voice box is dying and then we're gonna do the rda so hmm so don't uh emmy I believe

04:10:57.120 --> 04:11:04.240
shibi is playing class of 09 emmy bezu is doing an unlisted unarchived stream so please don't be

04:11:04.240 --> 04:11:08.080
afraid to go check that out because I'll still be here actually I don't know how long she's gonna

04:11:08.080 --> 04:11:13.120
go for that maybe I mean if it's four hours to do the rda side it is very rough on the voice to

04:11:13.120 --> 04:11:22.480
whisper for four hours so hopefully I know boo rda rda hate me is making pin pals do math oh no way

04:11:22.480 --> 04:11:26.800
I think to know if you play as a human you have multiple places where you can betray them

04:11:28.560 --> 04:11:32.880
hmm what is that like all the way up to the very end

04:11:34.800 --> 04:11:39.280
because wouldn't I wouldn't I just become a na vi at that point or am I still human

04:11:40.800 --> 04:11:46.240
you wouldn't I have to do the evil side now unfortunately

04:11:46.320 --> 04:11:54.800
I think I would ruin the run if I did it I beat the game already literally I think it's

04:11:54.800 --> 04:12:00.160
four hours for each side yeah there's any rda hate but gun and flamethrower fun though

04:12:00.160 --> 04:12:05.120
then every straight up ask you to switch like three four times oh do they I would know I love gun

04:12:05.200 --> 04:12:07.120
shoot so I

04:12:12.640 --> 04:12:21.920
right I'm gonna quickly go peep um and make a cup of tea I highly suggest everyone to stretch

04:12:21.920 --> 04:12:28.560
your legs don't be afraid to open up any stream the now I will be roughly three minutes it takes

04:12:28.560 --> 04:12:34.000

human stinky human stinky stinky um but yes please do consider standing up stretching your legs

04:12:56.640 --> 04:13:02.560
getting yourself a little snacky wacky um and then we'll jump in and you guys have to hold my hands

04:13:02.560 --> 04:13:05.840
with the game because I am actually genuinely terrified to play with women all the way through

04:13:05.840 --> 04:13:10.080
his camera angle so freaking low to the ground and if I've got big navi running at me I'm actually

04:13:10.080 --> 04:13:16.400
going to be scared so yes hopefully I really hope the game doesn't break while I'm awake for like

04:13:16.400 --> 04:13:22.000
literally three minutes but the game's so old right please do stand up and get some rest

04:13:25.760 --> 04:13:29.680

04:26:20.800 --> 04:26:29.020
turning the stream into a dad pun string on his blue I love this bit well when

04:26:29.020 --> 04:26:32.920
you guys like do witty comments I can repeat on stream I'm literally stealing

04:26:32.920 --> 04:26:36.600
them and then doing that gag over and over again

04:26:36.600 --> 04:26:41.600
shouldn't be straight up to working okay I have to go now bye bye thank you for

04:26:41.600 --> 04:26:46.160
hanging see when you when you come back because I'll still be like I work I don't

04:26:46.160 --> 04:26:51.440
know if it takes four hours to do the RDA side then I don't yeah if anyone says

04:26:51.440 --> 04:26:54.880
like they go work or sleep then sadly I don't think I'm gonna be there I think

04:26:54.880 --> 04:26:58.840
this is a eight hour stream rather a bit more on the shorter side than what we're

04:26:58.840 --> 04:27:09.800
used to but hey well let's laugh I don't know why but the crickets make me laugh

04:27:09.800 --> 04:27:19.080
hmm let's see but what do you get when you cross a snowman and a vampire

04:27:19.080 --> 04:27:22.280
frostbite

04:27:25.520 --> 04:27:29.800
why was that so delayed I don't know why the crickets were so delayed that was

04:27:29.800 --> 04:27:36.080
even more embarrassing that made it worse that the crickets were delayed oh

04:27:36.840 --> 04:27:49.200
trying man trying all right ready for this we're skipping we're skipping even

04:27:49.200 --> 04:27:54.680
the crickets aren't having it literally and we're showing up eight hours

04:27:54.680 --> 04:28:00.760
built on the shorter side I'll let you like I've kind of mentioned I weave it

04:28:00.760 --> 04:28:05.720
but like going offline after two hours I like sat and was just staring at the

04:28:05.720 --> 04:28:10.680
screen for a little bit I was like what do I do now like I've got like an entire

04:28:10.680 --> 04:28:18.800
day and I'm not on stream like it felt so weird like I don't know but I reach

04:28:18.800 --> 04:28:23.840
them a smart collapse type thing which is really good hopefully make some fun

04:28:23.840 --> 04:28:34.840
her little cheekies are definitely red I think I'm too German for the jokes are

04:28:34.840 --> 04:28:40.160
really bad they are terrible the jokes are not funny and that is why we we use

04:28:40.160 --> 04:28:45.040
the yeah because no one's laughing at the joke

04:28:45.040 --> 04:28:53.760
honestly it felt weird like every week I do plan in a couple of injured streams

04:28:53.760 --> 04:28:58.640
but the days that have shorter streams like the two are one like I really

04:28:58.640 --> 04:29:03.160
enjoyed needy streamer overload I did not expect to enjoy that I looked up the

04:29:03.160 --> 04:29:13.040
ending I would have gotten if I managed to not ignore her and like she was like

04:29:13.040 --> 04:29:17.520
ready to become a god and like take down 10% of the world's population and all

04:29:17.520 --> 04:29:22.240
that and I'm like whoa I so wish I could have gotten that but I messed up too

04:29:22.240 --> 04:29:28.040
badly that's okay I couldn't have known you know play for them you know you get

04:29:28.040 --> 04:29:31.720
none of the squat you got you and none of the squad laughing with that one I

04:29:31.720 --> 04:29:36.680
giggle you're still sitting on your feet I'm sitting on my right one right

04:29:36.680 --> 04:29:44.160
now and then left one is just wiggling the back of the chair don't abuse

04:29:44.160 --> 04:29:48.080
what do you say

04:29:48.080 --> 04:29:55.880
Nico from undead and what I don't know think of crisscross applesauce the way

04:29:55.880 --> 04:30:04.320
you sit like that but I'm sitting on my foot like against my good way good way

04:30:04.320 --> 04:30:08.800
to really enjoy streams of you I cuz I constantly like wiggle and move my legs

04:30:08.800 --> 04:30:11.200
type thing

04:30:16.000 --> 04:30:20.360
I was gonna be either putting pressure or moving them like cuz cuz I'm sitting on

04:30:20.360 --> 04:30:25.560
my foot there's pressure against it so it's like keeping me stationary you get

04:30:25.560 --> 04:30:30.560
a little grin over us a little mouth curve oh yeah did I have the ability to

04:30:30.560 --> 04:30:37.360
make you put air out your nose a little just a little bit faster yeah I'm

04:30:37.360 --> 04:30:41.720
thinking crouched no I'm not I'm not crouching I'm like sitting on them this

04:30:41.720 --> 04:30:48.480
time but I do go on crouch on the chair sometimes like I was having to send all I

04:30:48.480 --> 04:30:51.600
was talking to like eight people at once trying to organize something for the

04:30:51.640 --> 04:30:57.680
girls and I was golem crouched on my chair because I was trying to like get

04:30:57.680 --> 04:31:02.600
it done so fast so I could go to bed because I was exhausted I'm like trying

04:31:02.600 --> 04:31:06.120
to like send this an editor and upload these files over here and send them off

04:31:06.120 --> 04:31:12.920
and get the link and make sure it's a pretty like oh so yeah it was horrific

04:31:12.920 --> 04:31:21.520
although they attacked me when I'm Navi as well so honestly I'm just a

04:31:21.520 --> 04:31:35.080
wee bit deserved honestly these things are indestructible honestly I should

04:31:35.080 --> 04:31:42.960
unplug my mouse and keyboard right now I'm not even paying attention honestly I

04:31:42.960 --> 04:31:51.000
should but I think you could probably xp farm here if you had the tolerance part

04:31:51.000 --> 04:31:57.920
because you're getting 50 every time and my it says I need 1,600 xp to level up

04:31:57.920 --> 04:32:09.920
so yeah that's the pretty big xp farm ow my angry you're like I got paid to side

04:32:09.920 --> 04:32:14.160
with the humans okay this is this is not me I'll put a little disclaimer at the

04:32:14.160 --> 04:32:20.880
top of the screen not me not me you're not funny

04:32:20.920 --> 04:32:26.720
but your accent is doing the heavy lifting fucking hell you're not supposed to

04:32:26.720 --> 04:32:33.000
say that part out look that's supposed to be an inside thought absolutely just

04:32:33.000 --> 04:32:38.440
got annihilated oh my I don't even know if I can come back from that oh that was

04:32:38.440 --> 04:32:47.360
brutal I can't even come back from that I got 10 xp from driving over that plan

04:32:47.800 --> 04:32:57.640
literally okay the dogs don't get like perish from the bungee which is fine

04:32:57.640 --> 04:33:13.400

motion sickness and just in the forward spring I've unlocked a grenade launcher

04:35:41.480 --> 04:35:45.880

04:39:04.200 --> 04:39:09.160
the song from grills kids with guns oh no sorry I thought your reference in that

04:39:09.160 --> 04:39:16.320
music video I know the what's that other one I really like humility I don't want

04:39:16.320 --> 04:39:29.880
no isolation unfortunately I don't know the words very well like I never oh I'm

04:39:29.880 --> 04:39:33.840
just jumping whilst I'm accepting all these I've unlocked a nail gun veteran

04:39:33.840 --> 04:39:39.520
pack I can call in a motor strike hold on a minute hold on a minute this is

04:39:39.520 --> 04:39:44.600
actually uh maybe I admit it's a little bit cool I'll definitely keep zoom

04:39:44.600 --> 04:39:49.080
because it keeps me away significantly increased damage

04:39:49.080 --> 04:39:58.200
oh but that one's calling an airstrike destroying every enemy and be aware it

04:39:58.200 --> 04:40:02.000
takes a few seconds for the strike to our right maybe just defense I think

04:40:02.000 --> 04:40:06.440
defense speed and health to get me out of there and whatever the last one was

04:40:06.440 --> 04:40:11.680
invisibility and zoom get me out of whatever situation I'm in the video

04:40:11.680 --> 04:40:21.240
but Jack black follow that signal yeah yeah so I'm about to go full fortune

04:40:21.240 --> 04:40:27.680
son on the nappy I don't know what fortune this one is but how hot take

04:40:27.680 --> 04:40:31.480
coming in hall I don't like the gorillas oh yeah that's okay you don't have to

04:40:31.480 --> 04:40:35.960
like everything some things are for some people and some things aren't for some

04:40:35.960 --> 04:40:39.320
people that is how the world works I don't think anyone should be punished

04:40:39.360 --> 04:40:44.360
however if you don't like assassin screed brotherhood then I will happily put

04:40:44.360 --> 04:40:50.920
you in either Marcy's basement or Sheevee's dungeon take your pick you know

04:40:50.920 --> 04:40:56.000
up to you right we are just skipping through this for those of you have kind

04:40:56.000 --> 04:40:59.960
of just joined in you're not quite sure what's going on and we have successfully

04:40:59.960 --> 04:41:06.720
finished the nappy side of this game we are now purposely joining the RDA which

04:41:06.760 --> 04:41:10.440
I have never actually played before but we are still in the tutorial section so

04:41:10.440 --> 04:41:15.560
I know what comes up ahead like it's not a big deal or anything like that and I

04:41:15.560 --> 04:41:21.360
prefer paranoid myself you're always a good girl the whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

04:41:21.360 --> 04:41:26.920
why am I getting... hold on a minute why am I getting praised out of nowhere

04:41:26.920 --> 04:41:28.920
What do I do?

04:41:32.560 --> 04:41:35.040
Not everything no everything but no human

04:41:38.960 --> 04:41:42.760
Reminder stories. Whoa. Where's the print? Whoa. Whoa. You can't be doing this one

04:41:43.640 --> 04:41:49.260
That's not fair. You know like to take me when I'm not prepared. Okay. That's not fair

04:41:49.960 --> 04:41:54.520
That's cheatsy doodling don't cheat see doodle. Okay, Dr. Harper. I presume

04:41:55.160 --> 04:41:57.000
You must be rider

04:41:57.000 --> 04:42:02.040
Let's get you a day. You need to do something to prepare it. Oh, man. I mean you got you gonna get the guy give good

04:42:04.760 --> 04:42:08.040
I'm sorry, I think people in there are prizes not punishments

04:42:09.480 --> 04:42:11.480
I'm not here to make enemies

04:42:11.640 --> 04:42:17.240
Then we'll get along just fine. Now, please go and assist. Oh

04:42:18.200 --> 04:42:23.080
It's gonna be so weird doing the RDA side you listen noob

04:42:23.320 --> 04:42:30.120
I need you to grab me some flora listen noob. You ain't afraid of a few carnivorous plants. Are you aren't afraid of a flower among friends

04:42:31.080 --> 04:42:33.320
We aren't friends. Oh, you need to learn quick

04:42:33.800 --> 04:42:37.960
Okay, geez Louise talk about being unfriendly around these part

04:42:38.600 --> 04:42:42.760
Make her blush for every bad joke of today's stream. Honestly, it's been pretty rough

04:42:45.160 --> 04:42:48.520
Right if I remember correctly, there's literally

04:42:49.400 --> 04:42:53.880
Yeah, um, okay. I've just noticed that we have infinite ammo on this gun

04:42:54.920 --> 04:42:56.920
One that's not how they work

04:42:57.080 --> 04:42:58.280
to

04:42:58.280 --> 04:43:06.360
Actually, it's a wee bit of a pet peeve the one. Oh, we should watch those kiana reeve movies because they have the ammo reload thing, correct

04:43:07.480 --> 04:43:09.480
Um, how am I trying to say it?

04:43:10.200 --> 04:43:12.200
Like in movies where they just like

04:43:12.760 --> 04:43:16.920
With a pistol and like pistol literally have seven max like if you're talking like the m7

04:43:17.320 --> 04:43:20.200
Or something like that. Why where are the enemies? I can hear them

04:43:22.360 --> 04:43:24.360
Oh

04:43:24.360 --> 04:43:27.880
Well, I did ask to see them and no I can see them loud and clear

04:43:28.760 --> 04:43:30.760
Geez the cam. I'm stuck on something

04:43:31.560 --> 04:43:37.160
Oh, geez. I need I need some space. I need some space in order to like actually shoot please game

04:43:38.440 --> 04:43:41.720
If you're not gonna give me aim assist at least let me freaking shoot

04:43:41.880 --> 04:43:43.880
All right

04:43:44.520 --> 04:43:45.880
Oh

04:43:45.880 --> 04:43:50.520
They sound like puzzle gum from viva pañal. It's almost like they're based after flies

04:43:52.600 --> 04:43:54.600
Wait, we're so

04:43:57.400 --> 04:43:59.400
Johnson the babayaga

04:43:59.560 --> 04:44:05.960
Wic yes that one we should watch those because uh lake heather actually accurate with the guns

04:44:07.800 --> 04:44:11.080
It's very nice that they're accurate with the reading

04:44:11.720 --> 04:44:17.320
I love the way john wick uses reloads to set the case for gunfights. I don't even notice that that's true

04:44:20.520 --> 04:44:22.600
Unlimited ammo and mass effect cool joke

04:44:24.440 --> 04:44:26.200
Oh

04:44:26.200 --> 04:44:28.200
Someone said I might like mass effect

04:44:29.240 --> 04:44:33.240
I've actually never played the series before but some said I might like it

04:44:34.600 --> 04:44:36.600
I know he's called shepherd

04:44:37.560 --> 04:44:41.240
That's about it. Oh, no, I don't need to do that at all. I'm getting confused

04:44:42.680 --> 04:44:47.400
All the john wick movies are good. Yeah speaking of john wick. Have you played cyberpunk? No, I haven't

04:44:48.040 --> 04:44:50.040
I watch

04:44:50.840 --> 04:44:52.840
Cyberpunk but um

04:44:54.280 --> 04:44:58.440
I am still absolutely heartbroken about rebecca. I am so sorry

04:44:59.320 --> 04:45:01.320
is it

04:45:01.320 --> 04:45:03.880
Her name is rebecca. What's the name of the?

04:45:05.480 --> 04:45:07.000
The cyber

04:45:07.000 --> 04:45:09.240
You're all with the rainbow hair. Is it lucy?

04:45:09.880 --> 04:45:16.680
Is it rebecca and lucy like brotherhood? I'm getting brotherhood assassin's creep brother. Wait, it is rebecca and lucy

04:45:18.040 --> 04:45:20.600
What the odds assassin creep brotherhood and

04:45:21.560 --> 04:45:23.560
cyberpunk the anime

04:45:24.280 --> 04:45:29.400
I am I am heartbroken over rebecca. I'm so sorry. I'm gonna see something so controversial

04:45:29.800 --> 04:45:31.800
I have no comprehension

04:45:32.280 --> 04:45:39.320
No comprehension on how rebecca just doesn't auto win like people are like, oh, let's see. Let's see this. Let's see

04:45:40.040 --> 04:45:41.800
Lucy

04:45:41.800 --> 04:45:45.720
Oh, listen, are you can you open your eyes and look at how perfect rebecca is?

04:45:46.120 --> 04:45:49.080
I'll actually tell you some more development notes. Um

04:45:50.120 --> 04:45:52.120
You don't have rebecca's voice

04:45:52.520 --> 04:45:54.200
um

04:45:54.200 --> 04:45:59.400
On the concept of icy obviously icy before icy, you know applied and all of that

04:45:59.880 --> 04:46:02.760
We actually were quite happy to give icy to

04:46:03.480 --> 04:46:04.040
a

04:46:04.040 --> 04:46:09.720
Someone like that may have had a deeper voice because of rebecca from cyberpunk. So that's a fun

04:46:10.440 --> 04:46:13.640
Behind the scenes. Um, I am not over rebecca. My first

04:46:15.000 --> 04:46:16.760
True

04:46:16.760 --> 04:46:21.160
I actually am interested in potentially cosplaying her for an ace more stream

04:46:21.720 --> 04:46:25.960
Um, I think that would be a hoot and holler. Um, I won't show my face. Uh

04:46:26.920 --> 04:46:28.440
I'd not

04:46:28.440 --> 04:46:30.440
I'm not for that. Um

04:46:31.080 --> 04:46:33.080
But I'm happy to do like

04:46:34.680 --> 04:46:35.880
Nick down

04:46:35.880 --> 04:46:40.120
Is the point. I'm going to take a sip of my honey tea to see if it's simple

04:46:40.680 --> 04:46:45.800
But yeah, I don't know. Lucy everyone arguing about rebecca and lucy. I'm like, how is anyone looking at lucy?

04:46:45.800 --> 04:46:48.680
rebecca's just peak like design everything. It's insane

04:46:51.480 --> 04:46:52.600
Um

04:46:52.600 --> 04:46:58.040
You know, it's a really sad detail if you haven't seen the cyberpunk anime close your ears for about two minutes

04:46:59.320 --> 04:47:01.320
Um after no

04:47:01.320 --> 04:47:04.200
No, I need to say this part out loud close your ears for two minutes

04:47:04.200 --> 04:47:09.720
If you don't want spoilers about cyberpunk the anime the really sad fact is that rebecca

04:47:10.120 --> 04:47:16.440
Got an upgrade to her hands after her brother died to the uh, the crazy guy because

04:47:17.000 --> 04:47:19.640
Of the blowback she got from the shotgun

04:47:19.960 --> 04:47:26.840
She never gets any root ricochet from shotguns anymore after that fact after that scene and it's such a sad fact

04:47:27.080 --> 04:47:29.080
but yeah, um

04:47:29.560 --> 04:47:32.680
Anyway, sorry back to the camp. Uh back to the actual gameplay

04:47:34.360 --> 04:47:36.360
I'm just really passionate

04:47:37.000 --> 04:47:40.040
The cyber cycle. Yeah, so the cyber cycle takes out her brother

04:47:40.200 --> 04:47:43.720
But in that scene she shoots a shotgun at him and she goes backwards

04:47:43.960 --> 04:47:49.800
And then after that moment her her her hand upgrades come in like her fisticuffs

04:47:50.200 --> 04:47:55.960
Um, and she never experiences recoil when shooting weaponry. Um, and it's all because of that incident

04:47:56.600 --> 04:47:58.600
And it's so sad

04:47:58.600 --> 04:48:01.320
Um, but her design is just beautiful

04:48:02.040 --> 04:48:04.040
Absolutely beautiful. What am I doing?

04:48:04.920 --> 04:48:06.920
Yeah, let me drink my tea

04:48:09.320 --> 04:48:14.360
The recoil so a little background on rebecca studio trigger was asked to change her because

04:48:15.080 --> 04:48:17.960
Her design was too lollipop, but trigger went nah lollipops these

04:48:19.320 --> 04:48:21.720
rebecca definitely influenced icys

04:48:22.520 --> 04:48:25.480
creation with the hips area and the legs

04:48:26.040 --> 04:48:29.320
I'm not even going to pretend otherwise at peak design. Sorry

04:48:31.960 --> 04:48:37.320
I knew from the get go I wanted a troupe of tan, which is what emmy was and then icy

04:48:38.600 --> 04:48:39.960
um

04:48:39.960 --> 04:48:41.960
Is not troupe of tan

04:48:41.960 --> 04:48:42.840
but

04:48:42.840 --> 04:48:48.520
And but I did want her to have like the thickness of rebecca basically it is

04:48:48.840 --> 04:48:50.920
I mean, I'm happy to talk about development. I know it's um

04:48:51.480 --> 04:48:56.760
Like a zurra. We knew we wanted a charcoal and thick. So we've got a goddess and

04:48:57.960 --> 04:49:02.280
Yeah, we just took it from there. Obviously. Um, sorry, let me finish this tea

04:49:05.080 --> 04:49:07.080
Oh

04:49:07.480 --> 04:49:09.480
Yeah

04:49:10.920 --> 04:49:17.400
Adam sandler said you look like a cut of me. Are you wait in the game? I'm pretty sure that's from the game

04:49:17.400 --> 04:49:19.400
I'm sure I've seen a clip of that game

04:49:21.640 --> 04:49:23.640
Coming down with the

04:49:25.880 --> 04:49:29.480
I'll actually tell you some other developmental notes, you know if I had a lighter voice

04:49:30.920 --> 04:49:32.760
uh emmy

04:49:32.760 --> 04:49:36.440
emmy's design and every in lore and everything if I had a lighter voice

04:49:37.000 --> 04:49:39.000
uh

04:49:40.120 --> 04:49:42.120
I would therefore be uh, um

04:49:42.600 --> 04:49:49.720
I would therefore reflect if I had a lighter voice, but unfortunately I don't um, so, you know, uh, I take like the the big sister look approach

04:49:51.720 --> 04:49:59.880
But yeah, uh, don't be surprised if an alternative outfits. Uh, I look a bit more true to myself. Uh, and I am

04:50:02.280 --> 04:50:04.920
I suppose I'm a rebecca. How tall is rebecca?

04:50:06.520 --> 04:50:10.280
Net away doing centimeters. Don't give me freedom units. I can't do freedom units

04:50:11.160 --> 04:50:17.880
Um, but I guess rebecca's really very reflective. I think that's probably why I'm gravitated towards her so much as well

04:50:18.600 --> 04:50:21.720
Uh, because I'm just like hey like I just love her

04:50:23.400 --> 04:50:27.480
I'm gonna leave for the night. So here's your bro teeth brushing. Yes. Thank you

04:50:28.360 --> 04:50:32.840
So burping my I'm gonna burp my teeth if I'm not careful. Hold on a minute. Um

04:50:33.640 --> 04:50:39.080
Although I'm just gonna check how far away my my delivery is of my macs

04:50:39.640 --> 04:50:42.280
My cheeky mac is any any mac at you enjoyers?

04:50:43.000 --> 04:50:45.000
um

04:50:47.960 --> 04:50:49.960
Oh

04:50:50.280 --> 04:50:55.080
It's still on its way freaking driver at the restaurant always driver at the restaurant

04:50:55.080 --> 04:50:58.360
It's never drivers picked it up and it's already on its way. It's always at the restaurant

04:50:58.360 --> 04:51:00.680
Just hanging about waiting for a second freaking order

04:51:02.840 --> 04:51:04.840
I know that shit's gonna get here cool

04:51:05.240 --> 04:51:07.960
The version 2.0 update they did on smash her with

04:51:09.480 --> 04:51:11.800
He needed the update who's smash her

04:51:12.520 --> 04:51:15.880
She's 145 150. Oh, I'm too tall for rebecca then

04:51:18.840 --> 04:51:21.240
Oh, I need to get at that to the cymbord

04:51:24.840 --> 04:51:26.840
For now, I'll just use my

04:51:27.080 --> 04:51:29.080
Hey, Adam smash her

04:51:30.680 --> 04:51:37.240
Oh, the the guy that says the quote she's around 152 wait. I'm out. No. I'm not. I'm 16. Okay

04:51:40.440 --> 04:51:45.560
Okay, take rebecca and make her slightly taller. Oh my god me. She's so me for real for real

04:51:46.520 --> 04:51:48.520
She's so me for real

04:51:51.160 --> 04:51:53.160
Behold how tall is she streaming on out?

04:51:57.400 --> 04:51:59.400
Oh, no, it's time

04:52:00.360 --> 04:52:02.360
We're the baddies

04:52:03.080 --> 04:52:05.080
He said the b word

04:52:05.160 --> 04:52:08.120
Wait, why the stuff that let's put the the b word together

04:52:08.760 --> 04:52:10.200
Oh

04:52:10.200 --> 04:52:13.080
I'm sad. I don't know what to expect from here on out though

04:52:13.800 --> 04:52:15.800
Strongly told rebecca calls

04:52:16.360 --> 04:52:17.560
honestly

04:52:17.560 --> 04:52:19.560
Is that what you're here for?

04:52:19.640 --> 04:52:21.880
Right. Oh, we can't skip this cut scene. I'm gonna do it

04:52:23.720 --> 04:52:31.000

Well, this is it. This is it

04:53:52.200 --> 04:53:54.200
We're doing it. We're the baddies

04:53:56.360 --> 04:53:58.360
We'll just spam them down I guess

04:54:01.320 --> 04:54:03.720

I picked the woman's

04:54:21.800 --> 04:54:26.200
I didn't think that was possible. I can't have you broken it twice hold on

04:54:29.080 --> 04:54:31.080
You feel

04:54:34.520 --> 04:54:41.720
Wait, what happens? No, I can't be a navi like I'm a fully human like I'll never be able to come back in the

04:54:42.440 --> 04:54:44.440
Wait, it worked

04:54:45.960 --> 04:54:47.960
Wait, so it does work

04:54:49.480 --> 04:54:53.160
Thank you for the tip. No, I don't know what to respond to that

04:54:55.560 --> 04:54:57.560
Maybe uh

04:54:58.040 --> 04:55:03.400
Uh, what wait, so it does work. Maybe just time and yoke because it's

04:55:14.440 --> 04:55:16.440
It works in fire folks

04:55:18.520 --> 04:55:23.640
Anyway, you don't actually have to tip or donate or anything into the work, but thank you very much

04:55:27.880 --> 04:55:31.000
We just got annihilated by a banshee. Jeez

04:55:33.000 --> 04:55:36.680
Oh, well, we all saw that move into frame, but hey, who?

04:55:38.680 --> 04:55:41.560
Okay, this is actually quite different. I thought he was just gonna

04:55:46.440 --> 04:55:49.960
Wow, I didn't even know

04:55:53.960 --> 04:55:55.960
We don't have to but we want to give her

04:55:58.440 --> 04:56:00.680
Oh my gosh, okay

04:56:02.520 --> 04:56:06.120
Well, we survived a helicopter crash and an attack from an akran

04:56:06.840 --> 04:56:08.280
Are you all right?

04:56:08.280 --> 04:56:11.080
I think I'm okay, but the pilots banged up pretty bad

04:56:11.720 --> 04:56:13.720
The radio's fried too

04:56:13.720 --> 04:56:19.320
You've got to go for help. There's an rda mining camp a few mikes from here. I'll stick the pipe into my can

04:56:19.960 --> 04:56:23.720
Don't worry. I'll be fine. I've got a full clip any vultures come home

04:56:24.280 --> 04:56:26.920
I'll have to go out on my own

04:56:29.080 --> 04:56:32.040
No, I don't want to go out on my own. I'm scared

04:56:37.800 --> 04:56:44.120
Have I got new oh wait, so is this my wardrobe change? Oh, I literally is it's just more armor

04:56:46.200 --> 04:56:48.200
Mmm

04:56:48.680 --> 04:56:53.000
I'll just follow the HUD. This has to go this way. What is she shouldn't she shouldn't?

04:56:53.720 --> 04:56:57.720
Oh, she is oh things can attack me from the sky as well

04:57:00.680 --> 04:57:03.640
Wait, these aren't recycled maps at all

04:57:06.040 --> 04:57:10.680
No, the plants I'm scared. Wait, I can't have a limit on what I like

04:57:11.400 --> 04:57:13.400
All right

04:57:16.200 --> 04:57:19.480
Is it maybe the head is gonna take more damage?

04:57:21.400 --> 04:57:23.400
I don't I don't know

04:57:24.200 --> 04:57:27.960
Flamethrowers are effective against all plants that have one. What's this gun?

04:57:32.040 --> 04:57:37.480
Oh, they'll have a flamethrower. Oh, I'll have infinite pistol. Okay. Okay

04:57:40.840 --> 04:57:42.840
I have to show my shooting skills

04:57:42.840 --> 04:57:43.880
literally

04:57:43.880 --> 04:57:50.360
I thought they were just gonna recycle all of the maps, but this is like an entirely new side of the game

04:57:50.360 --> 04:57:54.280
I know this sounds so silly, but I just assumed they recycled the maps and like

04:57:55.400 --> 04:57:57.640
Oh, oh, I'm claiming that all right

04:57:59.240 --> 04:58:01.240
Uh

04:58:01.240 --> 04:58:03.240
Okay, I can do it

04:58:06.280 --> 04:58:08.280
Okay, I've got more ammo

04:58:09.160 --> 04:58:10.680

Right, we're doing a biz

04:58:36.440 --> 04:58:38.440
Oh, there's one over

04:58:59.880 --> 04:59:03.960

04:59:21.320 --> 04:59:24.200
Oh, I can't do it. I'm actually sweating right out

04:59:26.120 --> 04:59:28.120
There is so

04:59:28.440 --> 04:59:31.960
Can I make it through the poison without having to destroy them all the time?

04:59:32.680 --> 04:59:35.800
Oh, please keep your ink to yourself

04:59:36.760 --> 04:59:38.120

Moby heart, right. Let's try that again without doing that

05:00:14.760 --> 05:00:16.760
No running

05:00:16.840 --> 05:00:21.720
Just shoot. Wait, are you not responding? Can I respawn or my game already broke?

05:00:23.800 --> 05:00:25.480

Hold on. Let me go at the front door

I'm back. Oh, we forgot it. Okay. I'm glad that thing doesn't slip down and like take my freaking eyeballs out my skull

All right, yo, wait, yes, this is so bad for me

05:02:14.760 --> 05:02:17.400
But if it's bad for me, why does it taste so good?

05:02:20.520 --> 05:02:25.240
Well, it's like I'm gonna need to be so brave. I'm sorry. I'm so bad at this like

05:02:27.880 --> 05:02:33.800
Hmm, you're having a sip of my chocolate milkshake. Yes, I'm literally having a chocolate milkshake at 9 a.m

05:02:34.520 --> 05:02:36.520
And then nothing you can do about it

05:02:39.960 --> 05:02:44.840
Is it cold you bet your ass it's cold because that guy was sitting at a flipping restaurant for ages

05:02:46.120 --> 05:02:49.720
Okay, um, I would tab out to read any

05:02:50.360 --> 05:02:56.200
Marshmallows, however the game breaks when I do that. So, uh, I'm just gonna read chat and munch away

05:02:57.400 --> 05:03:03.960
Uh, so, uh, please if you don't like munchin sounds emmy's live. She's live, but me. I'm a munch in your ears

More headpats for the most adorable cutlery

05:03:35.640 --> 05:03:37.400
Okay

05:03:37.400 --> 05:03:43.800
Hopefully I don't mess up too many times actually doing the RDA campaign, but I have to admit it's like terrifying

05:03:43.800 --> 05:03:46.840
I had no I thought the maps were going to be the same and I was like, okay

05:03:46.840 --> 05:03:49.960
At least the maps are the same and I'm familiar with the paths. Nope

05:03:50.920 --> 05:03:52.920
Hmm

05:03:54.440 --> 05:03:58.200
I don't they apparently sold 2.7 million copies of this game

05:03:59.240 --> 05:04:05.000
Yeah, that seems really low for like any game. I feel like that does that mean it flopped, you know

05:04:09.320 --> 05:04:13.960
Mm-hmm, I'm gonna inspire people to get a McDonald's breakfast at this rate

05:04:17.240 --> 05:04:19.240
Do it

05:04:20.200 --> 05:04:26.280
A little hard in America they do 24 hour breakfast. So I'm jailed if I have to admit

05:04:35.080 --> 05:04:38.680
You still think the tips are slightly broken or you're getting limited. Oh

05:04:40.520 --> 05:04:42.520
Hey

05:04:44.120 --> 05:04:46.120

05:04:46.440 --> 05:04:47.640
That

05:04:47.640 --> 05:04:52.440
Last tip did come through. I wonder why that would be maybe reach every region locked

05:04:53.960 --> 05:04:55.960
No, that seems silly. That's the answer

05:04:58.200 --> 05:05:03.480
I don't like break I don't like the breakfast menu of most fast food places. I'd rather try it for my main menus on

05:05:06.200 --> 05:05:12.200
I know it sounds weird, but I love to make some nuggies a salad and put them both together

05:05:13.240 --> 05:05:14.600
and wheat wrap

05:05:14.600 --> 05:05:17.000

05:09:01.240 --> 05:09:02.840
Hmm

05:09:02.840 --> 05:09:05.000
I skip the jelly and only the peanut bar

05:09:07.240 --> 05:09:09.240
I've tried the jar ones. It's

05:09:09.720 --> 05:09:11.720
Pretty okay, but just okay

05:09:12.040 --> 05:09:15.400
It's a thing they are raised on so as a result. They love it. Hmm

05:09:16.520 --> 05:09:21.800
I suppose like iron brews my example if you don't drink iron brews a kid, you'll never have a taste for it

05:09:23.000 --> 05:09:25.000
It's so bizarre and flavor

05:09:26.520 --> 05:09:28.520
It's like that and

05:09:28.680 --> 05:09:30.680
Japanese natto

05:09:31.240 --> 05:09:33.240
fermented soybeans is a breakfast thing

05:09:34.360 --> 05:09:36.840
apparently if you are a back-of-guy gene

05:09:37.400 --> 05:09:38.280
and

05:09:38.280 --> 05:09:44.040
You like it's really hard to enjoy natto unless you like force yourself to eat it over a while and then you get used to that

05:09:46.360 --> 05:09:48.840
Yeah, like it's hard it's hard to get into it. Hmm

05:09:48.840 --> 05:09:50.840
Hmm

05:09:52.280 --> 05:09:54.680
Remember the old commercial from it made from

05:09:56.280 --> 05:09:58.280
Gerders

05:10:00.280 --> 05:10:02.360
It's cheap as heck and that's why we eat it so much

05:10:03.720 --> 05:10:07.640
I've had peanut butter toast and banana and it's delicious. It's very nice

05:10:07.880 --> 05:10:11.800
What's iron brews supposed to taste like they advertise it as ginger and bubble gum

05:10:12.280 --> 05:10:14.440
It tastes like battery acid. That's the only

05:10:15.240 --> 05:10:16.360
explicable

05:10:16.360 --> 05:10:21.720
Way that you can see what that orange liquid tastes like it's battery acid, but nice

05:10:24.040 --> 05:10:26.040
Hmm

05:10:28.680 --> 05:10:31.720
Literally mountain juice the closest you'll ever get to

05:10:33.160 --> 05:10:37.960
That it's just not positive. Sorry. I'm trying to eat and talk and I want to eat the food as fast as possible

05:10:37.960 --> 05:10:43.560
So I'm not holding up the gameplay too much. Hmm. I take a drink from my chucky milkshake

05:10:47.080 --> 05:10:52.920
Hmm, they forgot to give me a straw. So I'm literally just drinking out of it like some animal

05:10:56.520 --> 05:11:00.680
Hmm do you see mountain dew yes, I said mountain dew

05:11:03.640 --> 05:11:05.640
Oh dude, no

05:11:06.280 --> 05:11:10.920
Mountain dew mountain dew mountain dew. Oh, whoa, that's so close

05:11:11.560 --> 05:11:15.160
Mountain dew. Whoa, you can't tell the difference when I say that

05:11:16.360 --> 05:11:18.360
Oh, that's crazy mountain dew

05:11:19.240 --> 05:11:22.120
Whoa, it sounds like I'm saying Jay, but I'm no

05:11:23.080 --> 05:11:25.080
I'm saying you

05:11:25.640 --> 05:11:27.640
Oh, that's so cool

05:11:29.640 --> 05:11:33.000
Did you drink my manju? That's weird

05:11:35.640 --> 05:11:40.920
Hmm, okay, I didn't know I said a little kind on here now literally

05:11:41.880 --> 05:11:43.880
Did you drink my manju?

05:11:44.840 --> 05:11:48.280
Wow, why does it sound like that? I can hear it. No, dude. Do you?

05:11:49.720 --> 05:11:52.440
Did you drink my mountain dew?

05:11:54.200 --> 05:11:56.200
Dew

05:11:58.360 --> 05:12:03.240
Yeah, I've tried my Andrew. I don't think it tastes like I'm brood. No, but it's only the closest thing

05:12:03.720 --> 05:12:07.160
As a German, I feel not good here. Monka is bro

05:12:07.160 --> 05:12:09.160
love

05:12:12.760 --> 05:12:20.680
To do a drop of dew and to do that's all the same pronunciation

05:12:29.880 --> 05:12:31.880
You now have a new earworm enjoy

05:12:32.600 --> 05:12:38.600
All right, I've got two more nuggies left and then I've got this like burger McGrittle thingy

05:12:38.600 --> 05:12:42.840
I don't know what it's called. It's called McMuffin. Well, we call it McMuffin, but I think it's called McGrittle

05:12:46.920 --> 05:12:50.440
Mountain dew was originally made to be a mixer for whiskey

05:12:54.040 --> 05:12:57.320
I don't know when I'm gonna do my first like drunk stream

05:12:58.120 --> 05:13:02.680
I'm down for drunk karaoke, but I would have to rest my voice a day before

05:13:05.240 --> 05:13:10.520
I was very nervous about it like the first time I ever did it, but now I know that

05:13:11.480 --> 05:13:14.280
I'm not hitting them notes. So I'm gonna go for I'm gonna send it

05:13:14.520 --> 05:13:16.520
Mmm

05:13:24.680 --> 05:13:31.560
The original Coca-Cola had cocaine in it. Honestly, I just know that

05:13:33.480 --> 05:13:36.920
It would just have been such a good time to be drinking that stuff, you know what I'm saying

05:13:37.320 --> 05:13:39.320
Mmm

05:13:40.920 --> 05:13:49.640
I'm sure I learned as well that, um, what did I learn that they used to prescribe like, um

05:13:51.480 --> 05:13:56.040
I was a heroine they used to prescribe that if you were feeling rough back in the day

05:13:59.160 --> 05:14:02.840
The drunk stream would give a hundred percent a hundred out of 10 bar, but I'm sorry

05:14:03.400 --> 05:14:10.840
Here in brazil come to brazil many restaurants serve nuggets with creamy cheese or green green sauce

05:14:11.240 --> 05:14:14.520
What would green sauce consist of would be some sort of veggie blended up

05:14:16.360 --> 05:14:21.960
I would do cheese sauce definitely. Sorry, I'm looking my fingers like an animal

05:14:26.040 --> 05:14:31.080
Most of the nasty addictive drugs started as medicines honestly like they were just having a good time back then

05:14:31.960 --> 05:14:36.280
I just choked. Um, I don't know if you've ever heard about this guy called Sigmund Freud

05:14:37.000 --> 05:14:42.120
He was absolutely wild and with his theories, but he was also highly addicted to

05:14:42.920 --> 05:14:44.760
and um

05:14:44.760 --> 05:14:51.560
Like a lot of his stuff got discredited, but like as time progresses, he gets proven right again and again

05:14:51.560 --> 05:15:06.920
Also, there is the oh my god, this looks fucking awesome. I'm gonna take a big juicy bite for you

05:15:13.000 --> 05:15:16.440
I went out yesterday after stream to get those american sweets

05:15:17.320 --> 05:15:19.320
um

05:15:19.320 --> 05:15:22.840
The lady was so nice. She was like, oh, can I help you anything?

05:15:23.800 --> 05:15:25.480
and i'm just like

05:15:25.480 --> 05:15:27.480
Anything american you've got

05:15:27.880 --> 05:15:29.880
That's like smaller packaging

05:15:30.760 --> 05:15:33.720
I would love to take away with me because i'm just gonna taste it all

05:15:34.360 --> 05:15:38.760
And she was like so nice and helpful, but she was so surprised with how much i'm buying

05:15:39.160 --> 05:15:45.880
And I didn't want to be like, oh, i'm rooting them on a stream and all that. I was just like, I'm just really passionate about american sweets

05:15:45.880 --> 05:15:47.880
I'm like

05:15:52.840 --> 05:15:54.840
Hmm

05:15:57.400 --> 05:16:01.320
I'm on paw independent shop that I supported

05:16:03.720 --> 05:16:05.320
And

05:16:05.320 --> 05:16:12.280
I'm gonna inhale another bite. This is good. Yeah. Sorry. That is that's just what I imagined like a murky. Oh, any moment. Yeah

05:16:12.280 --> 05:16:14.280
Oh

05:16:15.800 --> 05:16:21.960
They used to prescribe they used to prescribe smoking at people we asked them off. That's terrible. Okay, go on a brother

05:16:24.280 --> 05:16:29.160
You got a pretty accurate spread of my well, like I put the picture in the discord for the girls to rate it

05:16:30.040 --> 05:16:31.880
and I told them

05:16:31.880 --> 05:16:37.720
I spent 53 dollars getting all of that stuff and they were like you got absolutely scammed

05:16:38.040 --> 05:16:41.240
Like that's not even worth 12 dollars. I'm like, oh, okay

05:16:42.120 --> 05:16:45.080
But um, I'm gonna make a little

05:16:46.360 --> 05:16:47.960
Rate thing

05:16:47.960 --> 05:16:49.000
um

05:16:49.000 --> 05:16:50.760
Like where I rate them

05:16:50.760 --> 05:16:55.080
So hopefully we'll do a fun little chart. I don't know if i'm gonna like anything

05:16:57.560 --> 05:17:05.640
I think i'm interested in this was it spicy cheetos ago or a spicy thingy or the or tackies or whatever

05:17:06.200 --> 05:17:08.200
I always hear about tacky

05:17:08.520 --> 05:17:09.640
um

05:17:09.640 --> 05:17:11.640
And

05:17:15.400 --> 05:17:17.400
Hmm

05:17:18.600 --> 05:17:22.760
It was rough, but like i'm gonna support like a wee independent shop. So

05:17:25.800 --> 05:17:30.520
Eat the chips last it's overpowering. Okay. Okay. Okay. We're getting the strats. Thank you mayor

05:17:30.680 --> 05:17:32.200
See for the strats

05:17:32.200 --> 05:17:37.400
Are you streaming the day? Well we team minus well less than four hours for mercies. Use your start time

05:17:37.960 --> 05:17:39.960
I

05:17:44.280 --> 05:17:50.040
Don't know what don't I thought dr. Pepper was in the uk but

05:17:52.280 --> 05:17:57.560
I think i'm confusing it with pepsi. I genuinely can't remember if i've ever tried dr. Pepper if it's an american thing

05:18:01.160 --> 05:18:05.320
Oh, you're playing that climbing game. I remember the thumbnail

05:18:07.640 --> 05:18:12.200
Because we had your skirt was open. So we had to close your skirt

05:18:14.440 --> 05:18:20.360
Honestly, maybe that should be a toggle for you. No, i'm not. Maybe we should toggle that so you don't have to worry

05:18:26.200 --> 05:18:31.320
Dr. Pepper isn't the okay. I've just never tasted it before literally i'm brewing cola

05:18:31.880 --> 05:18:36.120
I used to be a fan of fiend and a sprite fiend as well

05:18:37.000 --> 05:18:39.400
But fan i was like addicted to so much

05:18:43.480 --> 05:18:50.840
I do have an american dr. Pepper so at least i can stay true to the the task at hand not my open skirt, honestly

05:18:55.480 --> 05:18:59.000
Then you can accidentally toggle on and off and stream true

05:19:02.120 --> 05:19:05.000
The only person who worries for receiving followers aim

05:19:07.000 --> 05:19:14.040
Dr. Pepper taste dr. Pepper taste kind of cola with with mint mint mint fizzy juice

05:19:14.840 --> 05:19:18.440
I'm not sure mint fizzy juice is gonna go down well with me. I do apologize

05:19:26.520 --> 05:19:29.640
I just remembered i'm not sure another brazilian already took it first

05:19:30.600 --> 05:19:34.440
So i'll do it myself come to brazil cutlass congrats. You're the first one to do it

05:19:35.320 --> 05:19:37.320
Come to brazil

05:19:37.400 --> 05:19:39.400
I don't think i know any

05:19:41.240 --> 05:19:43.240
Plus so tell a bae

05:19:44.440 --> 05:19:46.840
Plus so tell a bae is all i can say

05:19:52.120 --> 05:19:55.880
I'm almost finished i'm so sorry for those who are waiting on the gameplay

05:19:57.320 --> 05:19:59.320
I think dr. Pepper tasted medicine

05:20:00.200 --> 05:20:01.720
mint

05:20:01.720 --> 05:20:05.160
Not like cinnamon. Sorry not ice cream soda just cream soda

05:20:08.920 --> 05:20:10.920
Dr. Pepper's cherry cola

05:20:13.800 --> 05:20:15.400
Hmm

05:20:15.400 --> 05:20:22.040
The guys see the online discourse about the ingredients in like american food versus like any other country

05:20:22.600 --> 05:20:24.600
And like so much stuff has been banned

05:20:24.920 --> 05:20:26.920
Hmm

05:20:28.440 --> 05:20:34.360
Hey, scrawny did you know that mint and spacy can be active at the same time in your mouth try it in your experience heck

05:20:35.720 --> 05:20:37.720
Mint and spacy

05:20:41.320 --> 05:20:43.320
I've never even thought of that

05:20:45.720 --> 05:20:47.720
It's like spicy water

05:20:48.680 --> 05:20:50.680
It'll be interesting to see what you actually

05:20:51.160 --> 05:20:52.280
Hmm

05:20:52.280 --> 05:20:54.760
I think that other drink was a and w

05:20:55.960 --> 05:21:02.200
Root beer. I think i got like creamy. I think it was cream soda or creamy soda a root beer root beer

05:21:03.400 --> 05:21:05.400
No, root beer root beer

05:21:06.200 --> 05:21:10.280
McDonald's you can check for ingredients big don's do you say 35 ingredients most of them are code numbers?

05:21:11.320 --> 05:21:14.760
Oh, yeah american drinks for instance. They often use high fructose corn syrup and

05:21:15.320 --> 05:21:22.520
What happens if I ingest high fructose corn syrup dialects explode? It's a dangerous

05:21:30.680 --> 05:21:32.680
Hmm

05:21:32.920 --> 05:21:34.920
No, kinder eggs

05:21:35.160 --> 05:21:38.760
Actually, you know what's even sadder about the kinder egg ban the new realize

05:21:39.480 --> 05:21:41.480
The only reason those children

05:21:41.880 --> 05:21:48.200
Hmm past because of the kinder egg was because their parents weren't even paying attention to them

05:21:48.840 --> 05:21:50.840
Which is such a wee shame like it's

05:21:53.160 --> 05:21:55.160
Um out of everything

05:21:57.880 --> 05:21:59.880
They have to ban it

05:22:00.040 --> 05:22:05.560
Instead of being like hey here public announcement pay attention to your little ones because we didn't know

05:22:06.120 --> 05:22:07.080
um

05:22:07.080 --> 05:22:09.080
little ones explore

05:22:09.640 --> 05:22:15.320
Using their mouth. That's why you can imagine literally licking any surface because you did it as a wee babby

05:22:15.320 --> 05:22:18.120
It's an exploratory thing. You learn so much from it

05:22:19.400 --> 05:22:21.400
Like for example if I tell you

05:22:22.360 --> 05:22:25.960
To imagine what it's like licking a cold pole with rain

05:22:27.240 --> 05:22:31.800
It's gonna sound i'm in danger. Why is it red? Why is it red? I saw that

05:22:33.240 --> 05:22:35.880
I saw that I just entered combat there for a second

05:22:36.680 --> 05:22:40.360
Monka is Monka is I saw that looks like I'm not watching your game

05:22:41.960 --> 05:22:43.960
um

05:22:44.360 --> 05:22:48.280
My HUD went red. I I'm covering up the HUD like with my big hair

05:22:48.680 --> 05:22:53.240
But it went red which meant I was under attack there. So I don't know what just happened

05:22:58.600 --> 05:23:02.680
The kinder the American kinder egg man is real if I was a mean no I feel

05:23:06.600 --> 05:23:08.600
Oh

05:23:10.360 --> 05:23:13.160
Is that also why there's no toys in the cereal I never even thought about that

05:23:20.760 --> 05:23:22.760
Oh flew into my cross here

05:23:27.720 --> 05:23:29.720
Okay last bite

05:23:29.800 --> 05:23:32.360
Last bite. I'm gonna go get a cola actually

05:23:32.440 --> 05:23:36.760
I wouldn't mind a cola after that just to really really make sure my health is really bad

05:23:37.400 --> 05:23:39.400
McDonald's and cola why not

05:24:03.000 --> 05:24:05.000
Oh

05:24:06.840 --> 05:24:08.840
My god my headset

05:24:10.520 --> 05:24:14.680
My headset just moved in a flinch. I don't think I was getting attacked in real life

05:24:16.200 --> 05:24:18.200
Yes, Louise

05:24:19.320 --> 05:24:21.320
I'm farming the dump it on

05:24:23.720 --> 05:24:26.040
Ain't swallows before a choke. Hold on a minute

05:24:26.760 --> 05:24:28.760
Oh

05:24:29.800 --> 05:24:35.080
Okay cola time have a little sip of cola with the edge. I'll try and have a little bit more of that milkshake

05:24:38.280 --> 05:24:40.280
Yucky milkshake

05:24:44.280 --> 05:24:48.200
Right, I've probably got a big burp generating because I've just eaten so I do apologize

05:24:48.280 --> 05:24:50.280
Unless you want me to get out of the way in there

05:24:51.240 --> 05:24:54.440
Mm-hmm, so I can have a sip you absolutely can't have a sip of the cola

I've not tried it. No our vagemate. No

05:27:12.680 --> 05:27:17.160
She's fueled up better firing circuits of fries because everyone's given it such a terrible review

05:27:17.160 --> 05:27:20.200
I'm like, I don't really want to spend money on it just to like have a wee dip

05:27:20.840 --> 05:27:24.680
Look around they destroy my paper. You don't have to tell me

05:27:26.200 --> 05:27:31.880
That's the weird. Oh, that's the weird thing because you are okay. You're timing the blush or something. Hmm

05:27:32.600 --> 05:27:38.120
Um, actually, I should probably you know, I've paid a lot. I'm not gonna lie. I've paid a lot for all these emotes

We were discussing should we have p.o boxes

05:28:09.560 --> 05:28:12.920
But I said to the girl like it's just far too dangerous on this day and age

05:28:13.240 --> 05:28:15.880
Like with trackers and stuff and there's been so many streamers

05:28:17.080 --> 05:28:19.080

That was terrible. Don't recommend

05:29:15.080 --> 05:29:19.640
Oh, he perished the banshees are pretty hairy out there. You're gonna need the chopper missile online

05:29:20.840 --> 05:29:22.920
Grab new firing circuits from the samson ruckage

05:29:24.360 --> 05:29:27.720
I'm sure regiment wouldn't be considered a bio weapon

Wait, am I safe? No, geez. Can I enter the cutscene or am I about to get like absolutely mugged in the cutscene?

05:32:41.960 --> 05:32:43.960
Oh

05:32:44.760 --> 05:32:48.040
I'm out of like the render distance for it, but there we go

05:32:49.240 --> 05:32:50.760
Oh

Wait, so I can like actually die in these choppers

05:33:08.280 --> 05:33:10.280
Oh my god

05:33:10.840 --> 05:33:13.400
Oh, did I do it? No, I got you now

Get me out of this like right now seriously

05:33:21.320 --> 05:33:26.920
Go up and then go forward a bit and up and forward and up and forward and up and forward right just up

05:33:27.720 --> 05:33:29.720
And then we'll go just forward. Okay

05:33:30.920 --> 05:33:36.600
Easy easy on the tilt. Why are you it's literally tilting me? I don't know why insist on tilting me

05:33:37.480 --> 05:33:44.520
Squishy human versus navi with their carbon fiber reinforced bones. Honestly. Oh my god. I just missed the helipad as well

05:33:45.400 --> 05:33:47.000
Oh, let me sit down

05:33:47.000 --> 05:33:49.640
Get get me out of that. I'm gonna vomit if I'm in that any longer

05:33:50.520 --> 05:33:54.760
You guys can deal with the freaking bad guys because I'm just absolutely rubbish get me inside

05:33:55.640 --> 05:33:59.240
You have rockets. Oh, I didn't know. Okay, that might be a little bit easier

05:34:00.600 --> 05:34:03.320
I'm holding on good girl. Wait. Why are we thinking?

05:34:07.240 --> 05:34:09.480
Must be because everything wants to hurt you here

05:34:12.600 --> 05:34:14.600
Wounded are in down

05:34:16.680 --> 05:34:20.200
Commander palco is ready for you. All right. How's the game so far?

05:34:20.680 --> 05:34:24.040
We've completed the navi and we're doing the bad bad human side now

05:34:24.440 --> 05:34:26.760
I'm going to keep this simple, but I don't know what to expect

05:34:27.000 --> 05:34:29.240
I'm pretty scared of that because I've never played this side

05:34:30.440 --> 05:34:33.320
This project starts with you our signal specialist

05:34:34.280 --> 05:34:38.040
This is the sector you're currently in. We need you to go to these three ports

05:34:38.840 --> 05:34:41.480
Once there, you must collect small shards of unoptenium

05:34:42.120 --> 05:34:44.120
Oh, right. So we're literally doing

05:34:44.920 --> 05:34:46.920
Directly the opposite. I mean that makes sense

05:34:49.320 --> 05:34:56.280
But right now just get those three unoptenium shards. Don't worry too much about the details, writer. We don't have a lot of time

05:34:57.160 --> 05:34:59.160
Okay

05:35:00.040 --> 05:35:02.520
Good Falco out. You heard the man. You need to

05:35:04.280 --> 05:35:07.240
Okay, yeah, I have a few questions. All right. I'm out

05:35:08.200 --> 05:35:15.160
Uh, honestly, I'm like leveling up so much. I don't know I can call him. I've got weapons up for it as well

05:35:17.640 --> 05:35:19.640
It's trying to hate humans

05:35:24.360 --> 05:35:26.360
We are not human

05:35:26.760 --> 05:35:29.240
And you make it a lot harder for yourself than it has to be

05:35:29.800 --> 05:35:30.840
Hey

05:35:30.840 --> 05:35:35.880
Look, I'm no very smart. Okay. All right. I think that one will have full health. Where am I? Am I flying? Oh, I'm

05:35:36.120 --> 05:35:38.120
Is that flying?

05:35:38.200 --> 05:35:44.280
That has to be flying. There's no way I can do that on foot. Sorry. There's no way right who's ready to get motion sick

05:35:44.840 --> 05:35:46.840
me

05:35:47.320 --> 05:35:52.360
Okay, let's first turn to the first wait, what one's closest? Yeah, that one is closest

05:35:53.320 --> 05:35:57.800
Okay, first let's get hate so we don't bump into the walls or anything

05:35:58.760 --> 05:36:02.760
Is this the ceiling of the game is wow, we're already at the ceiling. Okay, uh

05:36:04.120 --> 05:36:07.480
Sorry ceiling of the map. My apologies. Hold on

05:36:09.720 --> 05:36:12.920
Whoa, this is like humongous. What? Um

05:36:15.560 --> 05:36:19.880
Oh my god, this is so much harder than driving an ikaran

05:36:19.880 --> 05:36:21.880
Am I looking for

05:36:24.760 --> 05:36:29.240
We're dead plant we're dead part. You know, you guys don't have a helipad here

05:36:30.280 --> 05:36:35.320
Oh, there's navi down there. Oh, I'm gonna get rolled by them. Hold on. Wait. I can see transport over here

05:36:35.720 --> 05:36:39.240
Which makes me think it's safe to put down the chopper here

05:36:40.040 --> 05:36:46.360
I don't know if that's true, but we'll try it. Oh my god. We're about to go against navi for the first

05:36:47.000 --> 05:36:49.000
Oh my god, that's horrifying

05:36:50.360 --> 05:36:52.360
Oh my god

05:36:52.360 --> 05:36:54.360
That's horrifying

05:36:54.680 --> 05:37:01.080
Oh, I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like it. I don't like it. They're so big

05:37:02.520 --> 05:37:04.520
They're genuinely so big

05:37:08.040 --> 05:37:12.840
Oh my god, I don't know what to do. Is this a sniper shot?

05:37:14.120 --> 05:37:16.920
No, this is a shotgun. Oh my god

05:37:17.720 --> 05:37:21.400
Okay, it's a shotgun. Oh, he's using a billy

05:37:23.880 --> 05:37:26.680
Oh, this is awful. This is

05:37:29.560 --> 05:37:34.120
Okay, I'm a big girl. I'm a big girl. I can do it

05:37:37.000 --> 05:37:39.000
Okay, it's fine

05:37:40.920 --> 05:37:42.920
I can hear noises

05:37:42.920 --> 05:37:46.760
I can see I'm getting shot at but it's okay. I've got oh, you're so big

05:37:47.480 --> 05:37:51.880
Okay, okay, okay two two shorties and dead

05:37:53.560 --> 05:37:55.560

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, don't stop. Look you stun lock me. I'll stun lock you

05:38:03.720 --> 05:38:05.720

Okay, okay, okay, okay, it's okay. Okay. Let him get up. Let him get up. Let him get up. Let me reload

05:38:14.040 --> 05:38:16.040
Great

05:38:17.880 --> 05:38:19.880
Oh

05:38:22.840 --> 05:38:25.800
Whoa, they just keep coming

05:38:28.040 --> 05:38:30.040
Oh my gosh, golly

05:38:30.840 --> 05:38:34.600
What does the cell samples do? Do they not give me ammo? I'm gonna run out of ammo

05:38:35.800 --> 05:38:37.960
I'm just gonna have to I think I'm just gonna have to go for it

05:38:38.680 --> 05:38:43.480
If they come at me, I'm just gonna have to deal. I can hear them respawn in the corner of my ear. I'm no bother

05:38:43.720 --> 05:38:45.720
I'm no bother. I'm sorry

05:38:46.920 --> 05:38:48.920

05:42:02.280 --> 05:42:04.600
And the kills I need to farm

05:42:06.200 --> 05:42:08.200

I don't want to unclog for the navi or le

I'm getting spanked

05:43:16.200 --> 05:43:18.200
And no the good things

05:43:36.280 --> 05:43:38.280
There's more behind me

05:43:39.000 --> 05:43:41.000
Hey, they're

05:43:45.240 --> 05:43:49.640
How are you supposed to play this the rda side? Honestly

05:43:51.160 --> 05:43:56.040
Freaking I'm just happy to see a plant. I don't mind if it wants to freaking do that to me

05:43:56.120 --> 05:43:59.000
I'm I'll welcome it over these freaking giants

05:43:59.560 --> 05:44:01.960
Then there's like 12 of them behind me

05:44:03.320 --> 05:44:07.400
I'm making this the most freaking stressful game experience of my life

05:44:08.680 --> 05:44:10.040
Oh

05:44:10.040 --> 05:44:12.040
I can't handle this

05:44:12.280 --> 05:44:17.560
Can I get like knee surgery to elongate me so I can at least see a little better where it's like going

05:44:19.240 --> 05:44:20.600
Oh

05:44:20.600 --> 05:44:25.240
No, you're no you're not even scary dogs. It's the navi that are terrifying

05:44:26.040 --> 05:44:29.480
It's absolutely horrific. Hi pimples. Hi to me

05:44:30.840 --> 05:44:34.040
I'm currently playing this horror game cause jame cameron avatar

05:44:34.600 --> 05:44:39.320
It's absolutely mortifying. Wait, there's a helicopter there. Do I want to take it? No

05:44:40.200 --> 05:44:42.200
I think I'll just take the car

05:44:42.280 --> 05:44:46.040
How is your unlisted stream or archived stream?

05:44:47.240 --> 05:44:50.680
With pin pals, was she being was she behaving?

05:44:52.440 --> 05:44:54.440
Was she behaving?

05:44:54.840 --> 05:44:56.840
Oh, you guys have her oh she mark

Oh, there's dogs everywhere as well. What is bombing me?

05:45:09.560 --> 05:45:11.560
No and vizgo

05:45:14.680 --> 05:45:16.280

I can't do this my wee heart can't take this where I'm supposed to go

05:45:19.480 --> 05:45:22.760
I'm supposed to go all the way back right. I'm going to take that helicopter

05:45:23.320 --> 05:45:28.840
And we can get the heck out here and we've done one of the four shard collection missions

05:45:29.400 --> 05:45:31.640
I assume it's just going to copy the previous

05:45:32.360 --> 05:45:33.720
um

05:45:33.720 --> 05:45:37.960
Tactics. Hi. Hi. I'm me currently playing a horror game right now. It's awful

05:45:38.680 --> 05:45:40.680
It's terrible

05:45:41.240 --> 05:45:43.240
Oh

05:45:43.320 --> 05:45:47.240
We did homework and brushed teeth. Oh, did you actually we're brushing your teeth, too

05:45:47.480 --> 05:45:49.480
Oh

05:45:51.000 --> 05:45:56.120
Is this gonna be another 12 hour stream no, it's gonna be eight hours if I don't die too much

05:45:57.160 --> 05:46:01.320
I have successfully completed the navi storyline in this game

05:46:01.480 --> 05:46:04.520
I'm having to go below because the map isn't letting me go above

05:46:05.160 --> 05:46:07.160
Is this a dead end?

05:46:10.120 --> 05:46:12.200
I'm not safe anywhere

05:46:13.480 --> 05:46:15.480
Genuinely not safe anywhere

05:46:16.040 --> 05:46:18.040
How do I do my bombs?

05:46:19.720 --> 05:46:21.720
I don't know how to do bombs

05:46:24.840 --> 05:46:29.720
You say I have bombs but nothing oh, wow, I do have bombs. Okay, well

05:46:34.040 --> 05:46:38.360
Whoa, whoa, I need to go up. Holy crap. Can you go up so we can get like a bird's eye view on these?

05:46:40.360 --> 05:46:45.240
Oh for goodness sake, where can I land there's navi everywhere

05:46:45.720 --> 05:46:48.360
I can't believe it. There's people everywhere that live here

05:46:49.800 --> 05:46:51.800
Oh, this controls are awful

05:46:52.840 --> 05:46:57.480
I missed the falcon from halo and literally I'm getting wrecked and decked because of controls

05:46:58.760 --> 05:47:02.680
Great, I need to destroy that ikram that's there. I don't know

05:47:06.040 --> 05:47:09.160
I'm screaming but I think I'm at a render distance or something

05:47:09.960 --> 05:47:11.960
Okay

05:47:12.040 --> 05:47:18.280
This is terrible. Oh my god. This is awful. Can I fly in here? Excuse me? Pardon me coming through. Excuse me

05:47:19.160 --> 05:47:22.200
All right, just land just land. This is awful land

05:47:22.760 --> 05:47:25.800
It won't let me land. I can't believe it won't let me land in the tiny freaking

05:47:26.600 --> 05:47:28.760
Right a crayons get my face

05:47:31.320 --> 05:47:36.520
Right everything's getting annihilated. I think they're just right right. I think there's a landing spot over here

05:47:36.600 --> 05:47:40.680
This is my guess because of the map. I know you can't see it because my big head's covering it up

05:47:41.720 --> 05:47:47.320
Just just freaking get out of this thing. No get out. How do you get out? Hello?

05:47:49.720 --> 05:47:54.760
Hello can I get out? I'm stuck. I'm stuck in this freaking chopper

05:47:55.960 --> 05:47:57.960
Get in my face honestly

05:47:58.600 --> 05:48:05.480
I need somewhere to park but I'm about to park next to all these freaking navi that ready to demolish my boss

05:48:07.160 --> 05:48:09.960
Okay, there we go. There we go. We're actually out of success

05:48:11.080 --> 05:48:12.760
I am

05:48:12.760 --> 05:48:15.480
Playing the lovely game of please ignore me

05:48:17.320 --> 05:48:23.160
And we're getting the heck out here and we're just absolutely speedrunning these because these are horrifying

05:48:25.720 --> 05:48:29.640
Shawnee doesn't know what she's doing only

05:48:31.000 --> 05:48:33.000
Wait, I'm probably really wrong

05:48:37.240 --> 05:48:39.240
Where the heck did you come from?

05:48:40.840 --> 05:48:42.840
Identify yourself she

05:48:45.560 --> 05:48:49.320
I killed all yous on purpose and you've all respawned

05:48:54.280 --> 05:48:56.280
Ah

05:48:57.480 --> 05:48:59.480
Eat lead

05:49:01.720 --> 05:49:05.080
The archers are probably the worst because they can pin me

05:49:05.080 --> 05:49:07.080
At least

05:49:08.840 --> 05:49:10.840
Oh

05:49:12.600 --> 05:49:17.640
I know that other ones around the freaking corner. Yeah. Yeah, no way that still hit

05:49:18.760 --> 05:49:20.280
Oh

05:49:20.280 --> 05:49:25.400
Can you guys stop using your abilities? I honestly do not remember the soldiers even this amount of

05:49:25.960 --> 05:49:27.960
Abilities are all

05:49:28.840 --> 05:49:30.840
I'm getting

05:49:35.320 --> 05:49:37.320
And another one's just one

05:49:38.760 --> 05:49:40.760
Follow the same vibrations

05:49:46.520 --> 05:49:50.760
I'm not the only one that can use oh wait, you're not the only one that can use freaking abilities around here

05:49:54.920 --> 05:49:59.960
Again aggressive. Oh, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Right triangle time triangle time

05:50:00.760 --> 05:50:03.560
Oh, this patch of dirt looks a bit different. I wonder if it was here

05:50:05.160 --> 05:50:09.960
Where's the triangle somewhere over here? Oh, this patch of dirt looks slightly different. Okay, we did it

05:50:11.640 --> 05:50:14.040
I played like two minutes this game back and then dropped it. Yeah

05:50:14.760 --> 05:50:15.720
um

05:50:15.720 --> 05:50:21.560
You have to play the navi side for it to be and remotely rewarding if you want to play a horror game

05:50:22.680 --> 05:50:24.680
Feel free to uh

05:50:31.000 --> 05:50:33.000

Midori how nice of you to show up

05:50:38.120 --> 05:50:42.120
When uh, you could have done that like five minutes ago and help them some firepower

05:50:43.160 --> 05:50:46.200
But why is on fire? Or is it just supposed to be dirt?

05:50:51.080 --> 05:50:54.440
She's becoming wild i'm becoming the very thing I swore to destroy

05:50:56.520 --> 05:50:58.520
Whatever keep going

05:50:58.920 --> 05:51:03.400

Hey, the name's Trudy Chico. Hi Trudy

05:51:20.040 --> 05:51:23.320

05:51:38.280 --> 05:51:40.760
Fighting for humanity isn't easy. No, it's not

05:51:41.720 --> 05:51:46.920
Oh, okay. I don't even know that's good for that tea tea up any tea uppers

05:51:48.280 --> 05:51:50.280
Freakin horror game honestly

05:51:51.560 --> 05:51:53.560

05:51:56.840 --> 05:51:58.840
Hydration check

05:52:02.280 --> 05:52:06.440
Slipping tin of some sort of liquid doesn't really matter what it is at the end of the day

05:52:06.920 --> 05:52:11.720
Oh, sorry. I've just why are you going to the side? I don't know but i'm drinking all horrible

05:52:14.280 --> 05:52:19.480
She's just really enthusiastic about the wall. Oh, okay, little cheeky camera. I don't know why you're doing that

05:52:19.560 --> 05:52:24.520
But I hope that's not joy con drift. Oh, oh, that's what I should name the gamer

05:52:26.120 --> 05:52:32.520
If we ever had a 2.0 model joe con drift with an eye with the joy

05:52:35.000 --> 05:52:39.000
Oh, I need to like a wink sound like a whee every time i wink it goes wheezy

05:52:40.200 --> 05:52:47.720
Hello, ah writer you brought me the first harmonic. Let's get started. I still got some time before the emulator's up and running

05:52:48.200 --> 05:52:49.720
The emulator

05:52:49.720 --> 05:52:52.680
Ah, you don't know yet all in good time

05:52:53.240 --> 05:52:57.640
Right now we need to upload that harmonic pop it into the module and let's see what we've got

05:52:59.080 --> 05:53:01.080
Okay, sure

05:53:01.640 --> 05:53:03.320
Here we go

05:53:03.320 --> 05:53:06.200
What's happening now? What's all this stuff for doc?

05:53:06.840 --> 05:53:10.760
Yes, let me explain the knobby have a unique relationship with the plan

05:53:11.320 --> 05:53:16.200
Using a sacred site the tree of sorrows. They're able to link directly with the ecosystem

05:53:16.440 --> 05:53:21.000
It's how they communicate with the entire class, but we're searching for something different

05:53:21.480 --> 05:53:26.440
Our research tells us that there is another site that can help us sever the knobby community

05:53:27.560 --> 05:53:30.280
You're after a site is undead for thousands of years

05:53:30.520 --> 05:53:33.240
I place the knobby call the well of sorrows

05:53:33.960 --> 05:53:38.040
If we can find this old door, this is why they aren't letting you name any more car. Honestly, I know

05:53:39.560 --> 05:53:41.560
I'll never live down front of the bosom

05:53:42.680 --> 05:53:47.480
But honestly we can take control best name. This is where your harmonics come in right?

05:53:48.200 --> 05:53:53.080
We don't know where this dormant site is so the harmonic helps you find its location

05:53:53.160 --> 05:53:56.040
I'm actually enjoying these cutscenes because I've never seen them before

05:53:57.000 --> 05:54:03.640
We can triangulate the precise location of the dormant well of sorrows. Now. Let's see what your first harmonic shows

05:54:07.480 --> 05:54:12.200
Excellent, did you notice the red dots? No, those are supposed to be a cutscene

05:54:12.920 --> 05:54:19.080
With each harmonic, we'll reduce the number of red dots to the end of one. And number one, we'll be our well of sorrows

05:54:19.800 --> 05:54:21.800
Do you agree with this plan?

05:54:21.800 --> 05:54:27.240
Indeed. Now I'm finished. It's time to check in with Commander Falco for your next mission

05:54:37.240 --> 05:54:39.240
I've got your next mission on deck

05:54:39.240 --> 05:54:46.520
You're getting to the feeba officer midori will meet you at the top feeba a new area. They really didn't recycle any of the maps

05:54:47.320 --> 05:54:49.320
She ain't no plumber. You'll be good with her

05:54:49.720 --> 05:54:55.720
An escort. Oh my god, dug it help. Please. Please dug it help. I would love a freaking partner in crime

05:54:57.720 --> 05:55:01.560
Those tree huggers are crying foul over this emulator all worried about

05:55:03.400 --> 05:55:08.920
Monroe mentioned that what is this emulator? You stay focused on your mission writer

05:55:09.480 --> 05:55:13.480
You start growing the conscience and you'll end up on the dead end of a navi spear

05:55:14.040 --> 05:55:15.400
dismissed

05:55:15.400 --> 05:55:16.920
Okay, okay

05:55:16.920 --> 05:55:18.920
Falcon needs you to travel to feba

05:55:19.880 --> 05:55:21.880
Hmm

05:55:22.600 --> 05:55:28.280
That's where they made different maps for each one. I genuinely assumed it was just gonna be recycled. I can't believe it

05:55:28.280 --> 05:55:30.280
I'm I'm I'm surprised

05:55:30.280 --> 05:55:32.760
But we've picked up one song so we need

05:55:33.560 --> 05:55:39.080
Two more songs and then I assume the third we destroy it or the navi destroy it before we get it

05:55:39.080 --> 05:55:41.080
So it's like literally a complete 100

05:55:41.800 --> 05:55:45.800
I could uh could flip. Yeah words and stuff. Um

05:55:46.440 --> 05:55:51.240
Hello, please fly me to the flea ball. Let's hit the envelope. Just promise me no power

05:55:53.480 --> 05:55:55.480
She really said no projectile woman

05:55:57.000 --> 05:55:59.000
The feeba

05:55:59.720 --> 05:56:01.720
Oh

05:56:02.040 --> 05:56:04.040
I feel like I'm gonna be even more scared

05:56:05.960 --> 05:56:09.640
Are you disappointed that they didn't reuse assets since you know the rda

05:56:10.680 --> 05:56:12.680
Period no

05:56:13.000 --> 05:56:19.720
I'm just a surprise. Like I just assumed the opposite was going to be same maps, but we're attacking from a different side, but

05:56:21.480 --> 05:56:23.480
Uh

05:56:29.880 --> 05:56:40.040
Well back into the free let's unlock the teleporter first and then get a sender voice from Kendra

05:56:48.360 --> 05:56:50.360
That's what it was

05:56:52.120 --> 05:56:55.160
I was I was wondering why the voice sense so familiar

05:56:55.880 --> 05:57:00.920
Is a bad ass navi warrior and his men have kind of said they put so much effort into it. They didn't get much traction

05:57:02.040 --> 05:57:07.720
There's an old conchak here. I'm heading over to I think in 2.7 million sales you made your money back though

05:57:09.320 --> 05:57:13.000
So investors can't feel too bad. I think

05:57:14.360 --> 05:57:21.880
I don't know if like avatar because when the movie came out it was like this big unexpected hit like no one expected it

05:57:22.120 --> 05:57:24.120
How do I

05:57:24.120 --> 05:57:27.800
Oh motion sick buggy. Okay warning for motion sick people

05:57:29.880 --> 05:57:32.920
Oh, all right, where we go first take a right

05:57:33.720 --> 05:57:34.920
far

05:57:34.920 --> 05:57:36.920
Maybe to the

05:57:37.320 --> 05:57:41.480
We'll go talk to the person however we need to obtain this quest from okay

05:57:42.520 --> 05:57:46.680
No navi, please you guys freak me out to high heavens seriously

05:57:48.520 --> 05:57:51.240
Oh in the plants even when I'm in the buggy

05:57:52.440 --> 05:57:59.000
Oh my okay, okay, okay. It's like lamp posts in that one game

05:58:06.920 --> 05:58:10.520
Oh, I didn't see it. It just came out of nowhere because it's the same color

05:58:11.240 --> 05:58:14.200
Shade, okay. Let's just accept the mission first

05:58:15.560 --> 05:58:17.560
Hello

05:58:22.280 --> 05:58:25.800
And grunts left and right you can't grab any shard until we take it down

05:58:29.720 --> 05:58:33.320
Oh I can hear a navi's bow and arrow behind me in this cutscene

05:58:35.800 --> 05:58:37.800
But kill the hammerhead before

05:58:38.600 --> 05:58:39.800
well

05:58:39.800 --> 05:58:44.120
I do seem to be a level. I'm not real quick though. Can I get more armor, please courage pack

05:58:45.640 --> 05:58:47.640
You know what? Whoa

05:58:47.880 --> 05:58:49.880
I can hear that. Oh

05:58:50.760 --> 05:58:52.760
Oh, I need like a long range gun

05:58:58.280 --> 05:59:00.280
Oh

05:59:01.080 --> 05:59:03.080
Come on in

05:59:03.560 --> 05:59:07.640
Now let me relive before we do this. Oh our we go cutscene

05:59:09.320 --> 05:59:11.320
I've heard really went nuts in here. Whoa

05:59:13.160 --> 05:59:14.840
Wait

05:59:14.840 --> 05:59:19.480
We don't even get to meet these in the navi side. I didn't even think they were in game

05:59:20.120 --> 05:59:22.120
Oh

05:59:22.680 --> 05:59:24.680
My god

05:59:28.120 --> 05:59:30.600
I'm just so surprised about everything

05:59:40.360 --> 05:59:42.360
Oh

05:59:43.800 --> 05:59:46.120
Get back up are you joking me after that?

05:59:46.280 --> 05:59:54.440
Is that me I hope that's not me and they're about to put me in the cutscene where it's right like gameplay where it's right in front of me

05:59:54.440 --> 05:59:57.480
Thank goodness. I thought it was pranking me, man

05:59:59.000 --> 06:00:01.000
We'll see what the deal here is

06:00:02.840 --> 06:00:04.840
Oh come on

06:00:07.000 --> 06:00:12.840
Why are you supposed I dashed to the side I need to get like vertical like right now

06:00:13.800 --> 06:00:16.520
Holy moly, why is that only going for me?

06:00:18.520 --> 06:00:24.040
I need is there like a rock I can hide on I need cheese on a rock like right now. I need cheese on this rock

06:00:24.040 --> 06:00:26.040
I'm not even being funny

06:00:26.040 --> 06:00:30.360
I need to like breathe on this rock. I need to cheddar the on this rock. I need to

06:00:31.000 --> 06:00:37.400
Do anything on the rock. Please jump on the rock. It's all I ask. I'm so small. I can't jump on basic rocks. Okay

06:00:38.360 --> 06:00:40.360
uh

06:00:41.320 --> 06:00:43.800
Yeah, see this is why I don't even want to bother

06:00:47.800 --> 06:00:52.920
I don't know why I just changed its mind. I am going to see if I can shoot from the spine over here

06:00:54.600 --> 06:00:59.000
I can hear it get closer to me. I'm vertical though. What you gonna do about it? Nothing

06:00:59.960 --> 06:01:06.600
Because you can't do anything when I'm vertical. I maybe okay. It seems like it can't come here

06:01:11.320 --> 06:01:13.320
Oh, yes

06:01:14.840 --> 06:01:16.840
Oh, I'm out of ammo already

06:01:20.440 --> 06:01:24.440
Get ready. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. You got a lot closer that time

06:01:26.920 --> 06:01:30.760
I am going to run out of ammo well before this thing perishes

06:01:31.320 --> 06:01:33.320
Azura's just gone live

06:01:33.640 --> 06:01:37.720
Okay, if anyone is interested Azura du Le is streaming

06:01:38.280 --> 06:01:43.080
Whoa, can it hurt me? It can just stun me

06:01:48.760 --> 06:01:50.760
I just put my hand on my head. I'm like, uh

06:01:53.800 --> 06:01:59.800
Uh, I feel it. Oh Azura is playing one shot. Okay

06:02:00.120 --> 06:02:09.640
Hey, Stormy. Do you think the notification discord could also post the girl's schedules would be helpful?

06:02:10.840 --> 06:02:12.840
Um

06:02:13.880 --> 06:02:15.880
Maybe I don't know

06:02:15.960 --> 06:02:17.960
I'm like seriously have no ammo

06:02:20.440 --> 06:02:24.600
Maybe it's a shotgun kind of thing. Wait, do I have more weapons?

06:02:25.320 --> 06:02:33.960
So that's my wee shotgun, which does them up cool. So that's my standard rifle. That's what I'm talking about. Maybe change this to what

06:02:35.080 --> 06:02:37.080
A nail hammer? Not that

06:02:38.200 --> 06:02:40.200
Oh

06:02:41.480 --> 06:02:43.880
What's that? Is it going down?

06:02:46.520 --> 06:02:52.040
I don't know. His health doesn't really look like it's going down. I'm absolutely spraying and praying and I'm gonna lie

06:02:52.600 --> 06:03:00.040
A motor strike maybe? Yeah, that probably seems much more likely because

06:03:02.040 --> 06:03:04.040
This is like really

06:03:04.680 --> 06:03:07.960
Uh, whoa. No, I press get me on that leaf

06:03:08.920 --> 06:03:10.920
Get me on it

06:03:10.920 --> 06:03:12.680
Hold on

06:03:12.680 --> 06:03:15.720
How long? How do I summon the motor strike?

06:03:16.680 --> 06:03:18.680
Uh

06:03:21.000 --> 06:03:22.600
B

06:03:22.600 --> 06:03:24.600
No, what am I trying to achieve?

06:03:25.480 --> 06:03:27.640
It won't let me put down the strike for some reason

06:03:31.080 --> 06:03:33.080
Uh

06:03:33.080 --> 06:03:37.400
Wow, I just completely destroyed nothing. I'm so good at this game

06:03:38.120 --> 06:03:42.440
She be she be finished? How was class of oh, man?

06:03:42.440 --> 06:03:58.120
I mean, it's getting weaker, but I'm not probably doing something horrifically. Well, let's be honest a

06:03:59.160 --> 06:04:01.800
Grenade launcher sure. Let's try that

06:04:03.560 --> 06:04:05.560
Okay

06:04:05.560 --> 06:04:07.560
I missed

06:04:07.560 --> 06:04:09.560
I missed

06:04:09.720 --> 06:04:11.720
Oh

06:04:12.200 --> 06:04:17.640
No, I missed what she be says and I can't I can't back out the game or it's gonna break

06:04:19.320 --> 06:04:22.840
She be she be raid. She's rascist. Okay. Well

06:04:23.960 --> 06:04:30.280
Uh, I'm not sure what on earth occurred in class of 09, but as long as you guys had fun. That's the main thing. Uh

06:04:32.040 --> 06:04:34.280
She was partying like the 1900s

06:04:35.880 --> 06:04:37.880
You were you went to great

06:04:39.560 --> 06:04:41.560
Jeez, that was awful that fight. I'm

06:04:43.240 --> 06:04:50.200
To say I'm confused about that fight is an understatement. Honestly. I hope I don't have to do that get a flame for next time. Thank you

06:04:53.400 --> 06:04:55.400
Don't listen to them

06:04:56.920 --> 06:05:04.680
Is the harem telling fibbers are you telling fibbers about my wonderful daughters?

06:05:04.840 --> 06:05:14.600
What's that noise you guys don't want to deal with that that that navi right there. No

06:05:16.600 --> 06:05:19.240
Hold on. Let me reload with some parish in you

06:05:22.680 --> 06:05:29.000
Okay, we're both as bad at aiming as each other am I so small he actually can't hit me. I'm sorry to think that's what's going on

06:05:29.320 --> 06:05:31.320
Hey, thanks. I owe you and your boys

06:05:32.040 --> 06:05:36.920
You have straight she be streamers funny as heck only came in at the end. I don't even know what happened

06:05:37.080 --> 06:05:40.760
I'm just here for this here and won't snitch. Oh, okay

06:05:42.280 --> 06:05:44.600
Well, for those of you who are comfortably joining in

06:05:45.160 --> 06:05:49.160
Mercy modis is going live in t-minus three hours at the moment

06:05:49.160 --> 06:05:53.080
We are playing a game known as James Cameron's avatar, which is childhood game of mine

06:05:53.320 --> 06:05:57.960
We have finished the navi questline and now we are playing as the bad guys

06:05:58.760 --> 06:06:01.880
I am absolutely terrified of genuinely fighting the

06:06:05.320 --> 06:06:07.320
The navi and so

06:06:08.200 --> 06:06:09.720
We are

06:06:09.720 --> 06:06:16.280
Just trying our best to get through the questline as fast as possible with at least amount of spikes as possible

06:06:17.240 --> 06:06:24.840
And uh, the the game has aged a little bit in terms of like, I don't know what they were thinking these camera angles and stuff

06:06:25.000 --> 06:06:31.720
Why does that look like it's gonna wallop down on me as I go past it? I saw that I can that is horrific. I've not seen that

06:06:32.920 --> 06:06:37.400
Oh, there's noises being made. Oh, there's navi standing up. Okay. That's why that's why

06:06:39.080 --> 06:06:44.280
We're just gonna keep driving to objective and everything's gonna be all right and

06:06:44.920 --> 06:06:49.880
We're totally not playing horror game simulator at all. Honestly. This is terrifying as a human

06:06:51.000 --> 06:06:54.200
Oh, please. Let me roll you over. Please don't get back up again

06:06:55.800 --> 06:07:01.560
Oh, please mr. Rocks. Don't ruin this. I don't want to fight the navi

06:07:02.360 --> 06:07:06.040
They are absolutely horrifying and terrifying

06:07:07.080 --> 06:07:11.720
To me. I'm not oh that car's gonna blow up. So I'm probably gonna have to walk on my feet

06:07:12.840 --> 06:07:15.160
Where or what am I supposed to do?

06:07:16.440 --> 06:07:21.880
Nope, you're friendly and I'm just shooting at you. Sorry. Sorry. I swapped teams. My bad. I swapped teams. Give me a second

06:07:21.960 --> 06:07:23.960
Give me a second. What am I shooting at?

06:07:24.040 --> 06:07:27.560
Right, let's get some. Oh, no, that's a grinny. Let's not do that

06:07:28.440 --> 06:07:31.560
Oh, oh, wow. Uh, that actually landed the grinny blundered

06:07:32.600 --> 06:07:33.720
Why

06:07:33.720 --> 06:07:35.720
Why are you not registering?

06:07:36.680 --> 06:07:41.720
The game's age should be a bit she we can do no wrong exactly the here and have been

06:07:43.080 --> 06:07:45.080
Trained well clearly

06:07:46.520 --> 06:07:48.520
Are they

06:07:48.840 --> 06:07:50.840
Is there supposed to be a shard here?

06:07:51.080 --> 06:07:55.560
I don't I think I'm maybe just to help them

06:08:01.560 --> 06:08:03.560
Uh, I will

06:08:05.080 --> 06:08:09.320
See like I'm confident as soon as I have allies literally I'm having people help me with these fights

06:08:09.960 --> 06:08:12.680
Okay, so it's a it's a clear amount mission. This car is gonna

06:08:13.400 --> 06:08:15.000
Oh

06:08:15.000 --> 06:08:17.640
I sure wish it came sooner. Oh balance mid-match

06:08:18.520 --> 06:08:20.520
What's the blue senderman?

06:08:20.520 --> 06:08:26.520
Oh, that's probably I'm actually terrified of them. Good grenade. Honestly. I don't even know how that hit. I didn't. I wasn't even

06:08:27.080 --> 06:08:29.080
Hey, Strani, what's going on?

06:08:29.080 --> 06:08:32.520
Playing a game called James Cameron's avatar complete the navi side

06:08:32.520 --> 06:08:38.520
We are now playing the rda, which are the naughty naughty bad humans and I am absolutely terrified every time I go against the navi

06:08:39.720 --> 06:08:44.120
Because they are so tall and lanky and scary and their arms are so long and

06:08:45.320 --> 06:08:47.320
Getting shivers just

06:08:47.800 --> 06:08:53.320
Right, we've got we need one more crystal from this map and then we can already move on out here

06:08:53.800 --> 06:08:57.880
Thanks for your help. You should know that your men didn't die for nothing. I'm gonna make sure of that

06:08:58.680 --> 06:09:02.200
Yeah, well then don't get killed. That'll just piss me off more

06:09:03.160 --> 06:09:05.160
Man said he's here for the count

06:09:06.440 --> 06:09:09.240
This game actually looks well made for a movie game

06:09:09.880 --> 06:09:11.320
Hmm

06:09:11.320 --> 06:09:15.400
Uh, I don't want to really write that because literally gonna oh my god

06:09:15.480 --> 06:09:19.800
But to take all of that on foot with all the navi is terrifying

06:09:27.160 --> 06:09:31.880
Can I repair it and we'll get like a little bit? Oh, is it stuck? Okay, hold on

06:09:33.080 --> 06:09:35.400
I don't want to run this guy over. So I'm just gonna

06:09:36.360 --> 06:09:39.640
Just need to edge it out. Excuse me mate. Excuse me. There we go

06:09:40.440 --> 06:09:45.000
This thing is gonna explode the moment I encounter a navi. I just don't know what okay. I'm already

06:09:45.400 --> 06:09:47.400
All right, hold on. Hold on. Hold on

06:09:48.760 --> 06:09:53.400
This is not gonna go well. I can already see myself perishing in like five seconds flat

06:09:53.960 --> 06:09:57.400
This is just the camera angle. Why did they finally?

06:09:59.800 --> 06:10:03.640
I was not even like explode out just perish

06:10:05.640 --> 06:10:08.280
Well, let's not do that again, I guess

06:10:09.160 --> 06:10:13.400
So I have to do this on foot and be absolutely mortified the entire time

06:10:13.640 --> 06:10:15.640
Let me put on the protection spell

06:10:16.120 --> 06:10:18.600
That was the dumbest thing I've ever seen. Don't ever do that again

06:10:19.960 --> 06:10:24.840
Where is it protection? Right, so I have speed protection health and blend

06:10:27.400 --> 06:10:28.920
I can do it

06:10:28.920 --> 06:10:30.920
I'm big girl

06:10:31.080 --> 06:10:36.680
I'm already level three on the abilities. So they're actually gonna last quite a long time

06:10:38.360 --> 06:10:40.360
Right, that's okay. That's okay

06:10:40.920 --> 06:10:43.720
I'm a big girl

06:10:45.160 --> 06:10:49.640
And this isn't scary to me at all. I'm not absolutely terrified

06:10:50.920 --> 06:10:55.560
And there's not a bit of pee ready to come flying out of me once I get jump scared

06:10:58.920 --> 06:11:05.080
We're cutting it. We're cutting it short. We are cutting it short. I have to admit this thing's about to unclog

06:11:05.240 --> 06:11:14.040
Okay, that's fine. It's just plants plants are allowed to expel that thing. I don't know what the heck it does

06:11:14.600 --> 06:11:17.880
I feel like it's gonna slam down on me and I just want to confirm or deny

06:11:23.000 --> 06:11:25.000
I get XP for destroying plants

06:11:27.080 --> 06:11:29.080
No way that's so silly

06:11:29.560 --> 06:11:31.320
I know how to farm now

06:11:31.400 --> 06:11:37.720
Right, we just need to go in this uncharted territory. I'm sure it'll be fame and there's not tons of navi ahead

06:11:38.680 --> 06:11:40.120
I'll need these

06:11:40.120 --> 06:11:41.480
doing

06:11:41.480 --> 06:11:43.480
Raider fleamin cart. I think

06:11:44.680 --> 06:11:46.680
It's okay. It's okay

06:11:47.240 --> 06:11:51.160
Okay, this is gonna last a good cheeky 10 seconds

06:11:51.720 --> 06:11:52.600
five

06:11:52.600 --> 06:11:53.720
six

06:11:53.720 --> 06:11:55.240
seven

06:11:55.240 --> 06:11:57.240
eight nine 10

06:11:57.880 --> 06:11:59.880
11 12

06:12:00.120 --> 06:12:03.320
13 14 maybe 50 15

06:12:04.120 --> 06:12:06.120
20 20

06:12:06.280 --> 06:12:12.120
Oh, oh, I've never been happier seeing a human. How's it going? Oh my goodness. Yeah, uh long day. Yeah

06:12:13.640 --> 06:12:15.640
Okay, there's a little fight going on over there

06:12:16.120 --> 06:12:17.640
uh

06:12:17.640 --> 06:12:19.640
I'm wondering if I should farm the wildlife

06:12:22.280 --> 06:12:24.040
You're a lifesaver

06:12:24.040 --> 06:12:26.680
You're a lifesaver and face of maneuvers

06:12:27.160 --> 06:12:30.920
Can't even explode the car that the higher ups

06:12:31.480 --> 06:12:36.680
The vehicle license. Oh my god. Okay. We just run away from the same thing. Wait. These don't go for me

06:12:37.160 --> 06:12:39.160
Even though I'm zoom in I am literally

06:12:41.320 --> 06:12:43.320
Please

06:12:44.440 --> 06:12:47.000
I did say please but I understand

06:12:51.960 --> 06:12:54.840
Wait, wait, wait, wait, there's a tail look for survivors

06:12:55.080 --> 06:12:57.080
We ain't looking good

06:13:00.600 --> 06:13:06.840
Cleaning zenos for XT is always a perfect plan. Yeah, I'm thinking maybe if I find a turret I might try and level up

06:13:09.080 --> 06:13:10.280
Hmm

06:13:10.280 --> 06:13:15.400
If that hammerhead tells anything is that you ain't got enough damage for bosses monka ass

06:13:16.760 --> 06:13:21.080
Are you implying there's a boss ahead monka ass?

06:13:21.960 --> 06:13:23.960
Because I I don't I don't know

06:13:25.320 --> 06:13:27.320
Stalker's valley

06:13:28.040 --> 06:13:30.280
Oh my god, this is where mersey lives

06:13:32.520 --> 06:13:35.480
Hey, wait, it's mersey morning and t-minus less than three hours

06:13:48.040 --> 06:13:50.040
I have to go against the thana or

06:13:55.560 --> 06:13:59.800
You rider. Oh, yeah, I think you were my ride. How can I help?

06:14:00.600 --> 06:14:02.600
I'm fine, but you'll have to

06:14:05.160 --> 06:14:09.880
Even navi had bosses like those dudes that took a lot of killing and imagine the reverse

06:14:10.600 --> 06:14:16.840
What does monka ass mean? It's a twitch emote where you look really stressed out and like, oh, no, this doesn't look good

06:14:17.080 --> 06:14:19.080
I'm gonna get that

06:14:19.080 --> 06:14:21.720
I'm gonna go backwards and get this

06:14:22.280 --> 06:14:24.280
and

06:14:25.400 --> 06:14:29.800
Oh my god, why is it such a horror ambience? I'm not even being funny

06:14:31.480 --> 06:14:38.440
Like the leaves shaking about the leaves are like so violently shaking about whoa, what what?

06:14:41.720 --> 06:14:43.720
What is going on?

06:14:46.040 --> 06:14:48.600
You're getting jumped by a pack of wolves you'll be okay

06:14:48.600 --> 06:14:50.600
Hmm

06:14:52.120 --> 06:14:57.720
This I cannot wait to get through this and let it be over because this is just

06:14:59.000 --> 06:15:02.920
This is too much from a little heart can hardly take a a desert guy

06:15:04.200 --> 06:15:07.080
They perish. Oh my yeah, this is

06:15:13.480 --> 06:15:16.360
How am I supposed to achieve anything?

06:15:17.080 --> 06:15:18.760
Oh

06:15:18.760 --> 06:15:22.120
I'm a standing in plant poison. They're spitting bile at me

06:15:23.080 --> 06:15:29.000
Bro, I'm sorry. I'm gonna need to like literally get a co-op mode right now so you guys can carry me through this

06:15:29.720 --> 06:15:33.400
You're not even shooting the plant. What are you trying to achieve?

06:15:35.560 --> 06:15:37.560
Oh forget it

06:15:38.120 --> 06:15:40.120
We hate nature

06:15:40.200 --> 06:15:42.200
literally what

06:15:43.160 --> 06:15:46.360
It seems like there's more soldiers placed everywhere though

06:15:46.440 --> 06:15:49.640
Maybe to help you through it just because they know they made it a bit harder

06:15:50.200 --> 06:15:55.560
With the plant and the wildlife and the navi ganging up on you at least like when you're navi only

06:15:56.120 --> 06:15:58.360
a little bit of the wildlife gang up on you and that

06:15:59.240 --> 06:16:01.240
Oh

06:16:02.120 --> 06:16:06.840
Yeah, we definitely need the freaking oh my is that friendly bombs

06:16:09.080 --> 06:16:11.080
None of those plants spank

06:16:13.160 --> 06:16:16.200
Oh, okay, okay, okay, it's fine

06:16:18.040 --> 06:16:20.040
Kind of fine

06:16:20.680 --> 06:16:23.180
This is just a slaughterhouse

06:16:26.040 --> 06:16:28.540
This is absolute chaos

06:16:30.440 --> 06:16:33.960
Chaos with the a ch. Whoa what got me

06:16:35.160 --> 06:16:37.640
It made me jump like the opposite way that you were

06:16:38.440 --> 06:16:43.080
Geez Louise right there's a sloppy a sloppy plant up ahead

06:16:43.480 --> 06:16:48.440
Actually, we need to play cameo because these plants remind me of flicks from cameo. I don't know

06:16:49.720 --> 06:16:51.320
We're just

06:16:51.320 --> 06:16:53.320
I cannot wait until I get level four

06:16:54.040 --> 06:16:56.040
um

06:16:56.520 --> 06:16:58.840
That's out that is outrageous

06:16:59.800 --> 06:17:01.800
How many plants there are?

06:17:03.640 --> 06:17:07.160
That's insane. Oh, there's a buggy. Thank goodness. There's a buggy

06:17:08.040 --> 06:17:11.400
Oh my god, is it gonna have better camera angles? Whatever this is

06:17:14.760 --> 06:17:16.760
Head I go forward head I shoot

06:17:18.840 --> 06:17:22.760
Oh, no, that's to get out. So wait, wait, hold on. Let me let me learn how to shoot. Let me learn how to shoot

06:17:27.640 --> 06:17:33.400
Is there not like an alternate weapon? Okay, there we go. There we go. Let's go. Let's get it. Let's get it

06:17:34.120 --> 06:17:35.720
Okay

06:17:35.720 --> 06:17:37.720
Wait, I need to walk her down

06:17:40.120 --> 06:17:43.000
Okay, I like this I like this I feel a bit better

06:17:43.880 --> 06:17:47.400
Feel a bit better things are going things are looking up things are looking up

06:17:47.480 --> 06:17:50.120
This doesn't even have a bad camera angle with the eye there

06:17:51.480 --> 06:17:55.000
Oh, maybe it does it's just because it's a bit. Oh, okay. Oh

06:17:59.720 --> 06:18:01.720
Be

06:18:02.120 --> 06:18:06.760
I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to get out of the way literally

06:18:08.280 --> 06:18:12.040
What on earth are things a freaking boulder? I'm stuck. Oh

06:18:13.880 --> 06:18:20.120
Okay, it's good. It's good. It's good guys. Why are you stressing so much like honestly? Oh

06:18:21.080 --> 06:18:23.720
It seems like you guys forget. I'm like MLG four or something

06:18:25.160 --> 06:18:27.160
Have a little faith in the streamer smile

06:18:28.120 --> 06:18:30.680
How about this mate? I don't know. Maybe I should go in there right?

06:18:32.600 --> 06:18:37.000
I'm just gonna bum rush it honestly. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. No, I'm not

06:18:37.640 --> 06:18:42.120
I'm gonna go back for that mech that is the bravest. No, I'm getting out. I'm getting out. It's gonna explode

06:18:42.120 --> 06:18:45.080
It's gonna explode. It's gonna explode. No, no run away from the explosion

06:18:46.440 --> 06:18:48.440
We're going for the mech

06:18:51.000 --> 06:18:53.000
Give me this thing

06:18:53.880 --> 06:18:55.880
Let me in let me in

06:18:57.160 --> 06:19:00.440
Okay, okay, let's see. Let's see what we're working with

06:19:02.680 --> 06:19:06.280
What we have how OP are we in comparison?

06:19:08.520 --> 06:19:11.080
Okay, okay, okay, let him get up. Let him get up

06:19:12.280 --> 06:19:15.080
All right. All right. Not feeling scared anymore. That's

06:19:15.720 --> 06:19:20.920
I've had blocked the way for this poor guy. I think so. Sorry mate. You'll have to figure it out on your own

06:19:23.960 --> 06:19:30.520
Okay, okay, hold on hold on we're cooking by gas because this isn't terrifying

06:19:32.280 --> 06:19:39.240
This isn't terrifying. I'm just kidding mech a time. I can't believe we're playing mech assault. See this game's just mech assault simulator

06:19:40.920 --> 06:19:44.200
All right, let them come at me. Let them get up. Let them get up

06:19:46.440 --> 06:19:48.440
Okay

06:19:48.840 --> 06:19:53.320
Let them. Yeah, see they always seem to hide the navi behind the like corners and stuff

06:19:54.360 --> 06:19:58.520
I'm just gonna let them attack and hope they don't keep respawning

06:19:58.520 --> 06:20:03.480
And then it's safe to come out. Okay

06:20:05.080 --> 06:20:09.000
Okay, okay now hold on hold on all is not lost

06:20:09.560 --> 06:20:13.800
This might not be the most painful gameplay of rda side you've ever seen

06:20:15.320 --> 06:20:17.320
It's called tools path

06:20:24.040 --> 06:20:26.040
The wildlife cannot

06:20:28.840 --> 06:20:30.840
Okay, hold on hold on hold

06:20:32.920 --> 06:20:38.920
Can you aim why does it never register like I really just not my register. What's going on with this bomb?

06:20:40.120 --> 06:20:42.840
It wouldn't even like hardly let me perish it

06:20:44.920 --> 06:20:46.920
I've always loved the mech soup here

06:20:48.760 --> 06:20:50.360
They're a bit

06:20:50.360 --> 06:20:54.760
It's starting starting throwing bombs at me. I'm just gonna move on

06:20:55.720 --> 06:20:58.840
I honestly think it's safer just to ignore everything

06:20:59.400 --> 06:21:03.000
And like only shoot for like xp or something. Can I like crush them with a mech?

06:21:03.720 --> 06:21:05.720
No, I can that's

06:21:07.400 --> 06:21:09.960
Oh, no, is that just get me out of the mech?

06:21:11.240 --> 06:21:14.600
No way they put this in the game because then you are come on jump

06:21:15.800 --> 06:21:19.720
The mechs can jump. Oh my god. That's so cool

06:21:25.240 --> 06:21:29.800
Wait, that looks like the mech can the mech's crouch. Nope. That's just reverse

06:21:31.560 --> 06:21:37.480
They knew exactly what they were doing freaking putting that one log there. I'll have to get out

06:21:41.160 --> 06:21:47.000
The game knew that I wanted the mech. I'm gonna get jump scared by like 10 things at once

06:21:49.480 --> 06:21:53.480
Now I'm gonna come flying out right go away. No you're scaring me

06:21:55.240 --> 06:21:59.080
I need the game's just freaking jump scare similar

06:22:00.040 --> 06:22:02.040
Well, let me put that down

06:22:02.600 --> 06:22:04.600
No, this is a battle dome

06:22:05.880 --> 06:22:08.360
Stop it. This is a battle dome

06:22:09.480 --> 06:22:11.480
Yeah, it's literally called pray to his den

06:22:12.360 --> 06:22:14.360
And you know who the pray is me

06:22:15.400 --> 06:22:17.400
I'm being prayed at the bottom

06:22:17.400 --> 06:22:19.400
Hmm

06:22:24.760 --> 06:22:26.760
No

06:22:34.440 --> 06:22:36.440
Oh

06:22:40.280 --> 06:22:42.280
No

06:22:48.120 --> 06:22:57.160
Friendly friendly, surely friendly, surely friendly, surely friendly, surely friendly

06:22:59.480 --> 06:23:08.680
Um, is there anything you already have perished me? I'm literally one HP in a dream. Can I like hate by hate?

No way listen to me if you run into him don't waste time just kill him the guy's a monster

06:28:27.560 --> 06:28:29.560

No, i'm not there's a buggy right next to me

06:28:53.320 --> 06:28:55.960
Okay, I felt safer in the mix than I did the buggy

06:28:58.120 --> 06:29:02.920
Why would you send one signal specialist on their own? Why would you not send an infantry?

06:29:03.240 --> 06:29:06.840
Sorry, i'm trying to discover what's the there seems to be two bridges ahead

06:29:07.320 --> 06:29:10.520
Seems to be multiple bridges actually if I go straight ahead and then take a right

06:29:11.720 --> 06:29:13.720
Not if you beat him first

06:29:13.960 --> 06:29:15.960
This was the best part in the movie

06:29:19.400 --> 06:29:23.480
They really paint the nDA is the bad guys. Oh the navi is the bad guys

06:29:24.520 --> 06:29:27.080
I mean, I guess it's like justify

06:29:30.040 --> 06:29:32.040
Now just spray him

06:29:32.200 --> 06:29:34.200
I

06:29:35.800 --> 06:29:39.800
Don't know if I should go they're actually really hurting me. I'm not gonna lie

06:29:40.600 --> 06:29:44.200
I'm I've already lost maybe like 150 percent health

06:29:46.280 --> 06:29:49.880
And I think I'm just gonna run through the best I can

06:29:51.080 --> 06:29:53.080
and

06:29:53.160 --> 06:29:56.200

06:30:36.440 --> 06:30:38.440
Wish I could speed up

06:30:41.400 --> 06:30:43.960
Take a right at the next right not this right for the next right

06:30:45.000 --> 06:30:48.680
Are you have you cleared the planet for humanity yet? No

06:30:50.360 --> 06:30:54.840
I'm not but I'm doing the nose slice saver. I'm doing the rda side

06:30:55.800 --> 06:31:02.760
I feel safe in the mecha tanks. I do not feel safe when I am outside of the tanks. I am absolutely mortified

06:31:03.720 --> 06:31:10.440
Because this is awful and scary. Can the tank even fit on this? Oh, thank goodness. It can literally I

06:31:10.840 --> 06:31:16.920
This is awful and my tank is actually getting low health. I I don't know what happens if it explodes or

06:31:18.760 --> 06:31:21.260
No, I'm getting out. I'm I'm getting out. I'm getting out. I'm sorry

06:31:25.080 --> 06:31:27.080
Okay, this isn't gonna go good

06:31:28.360 --> 06:31:30.360
I need to do the song

06:31:31.480 --> 06:31:36.120
And they're all gonna come at me. They're all gonna come at me. They were already locked on before I even came out of invis

06:31:39.000 --> 06:31:41.000
Oh no

06:31:41.320 --> 06:31:43.720
Oh no, oh no

This is fine. This is fine. This is fine. This is fine

06:31:49.560 --> 06:31:53.400
Everything is fine. Everything's cool when you're part of rda

06:31:53.960 --> 06:31:55.960
Everything's all gone

06:31:59.960 --> 06:32:01.960
Is it safe

No, no, no, no, no, no

06:32:54.360 --> 06:32:56.360

I don't know what he's freaking fire resistant. Sorry, but you need to patch this I need to patch up update pandora

06:33:04.360 --> 06:33:08.200
You're literally a while a while is cheating a while is cheating

Oh

Only I'm allowed to heal

06:33:41.080 --> 06:33:43.880
Please can I have infinite shotgun ammo that would be grand?

06:33:44.760 --> 06:33:46.760
Don't spank me again

Stop

06:33:57.400 --> 06:33:59.400

06:33:59.400 --> 06:34:02.520
Hold on. I need to take my sweet time doing this honestly

06:34:03.240 --> 06:34:08.840
Don't heal again. Please don't don't make this harder than it has to be

06:34:10.520 --> 06:34:15.880
Please this is what you get for disrespecting me so much in the last run. Let me reload

06:34:16.840 --> 06:34:20.840
Let me okay. I love the shotgun from from now and ever. I love the shotgun

06:34:21.080 --> 06:34:25.000
Did you see that dodge? That was actually pretty good dodge. I'm not gonna lie. I'm that one

06:34:26.840 --> 06:34:28.840
Oh, come on. Oh

06:34:28.840 --> 06:34:30.840
Oh

We did it. Oh my goodness

06:34:34.520 --> 06:34:36.840
Oh my goodness. I don't know how we did that

06:34:38.120 --> 06:34:40.120
A shotgun love

06:34:40.920 --> 06:34:42.920
Because oh my goodness

06:34:43.480 --> 06:34:46.840
What on earth have I lost my mic? Oh, it blew up didn't it?

06:34:47.720 --> 06:34:49.720
Where did I need to go?

06:34:49.720 --> 06:34:52.680
Somewhere I've not discovered it. Okay. I need to backtrack

06:34:55.720 --> 06:34:57.720
Is he shooting at me or is he shooting at

06:34:59.000 --> 06:35:02.600
Is the way of life attacking the navi. Oh the it is

06:35:04.040 --> 06:35:05.240
Huh

06:35:05.240 --> 06:35:06.760
curious

06:35:06.760 --> 06:35:12.600
The the viper wolves are actually attacking the navi. I thought it was an exclusive

06:35:13.560 --> 06:35:20.360
Hey, I thought it was exclusive to us malina. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something honestly

06:35:23.640 --> 06:35:26.120
Honestly getting much better um

06:35:27.080 --> 06:35:32.360
It was like pretty terrifying. Oh these things whip for quite a distance

06:35:36.760 --> 06:35:41.560
Can I make it pass without getting whipped? Okay, whew whew whew whew

06:35:43.960 --> 06:35:45.960
Okay

06:35:46.440 --> 06:35:51.560
I think wolves just don't like everyone in this game. Please don't knock me off the bridge. That would actually ruin my day

06:35:51.800 --> 06:35:53.800
Oh

06:35:54.120 --> 06:35:56.120
I don't have invisibility

06:35:59.960 --> 06:36:06.040
I'm gonna unlock the transport location unless unless unless that

06:36:08.280 --> 06:36:14.200
Have I made a mistake? I maybe don't need this transport location. I just thought it was important to unlock but

06:36:16.360 --> 06:36:19.160
Are there any games with hypno effect not that I can recall

06:36:19.720 --> 06:36:20.840
Oh

06:36:20.840 --> 06:36:27.080
Maybe that whoa these whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa these flies are stun locking me

06:36:29.240 --> 06:36:33.400
Sorry guys, I'm gonna leave you behind to get absolutely annihilated because I don't want to deal with that

06:36:35.800 --> 06:36:40.440
Dude, I don't know if that card game encryption has hypno in it. I don't I don't know if I'm just making that up

06:36:40.440 --> 06:36:44.440
I I've not played it myself. I think I've like paused for like two milliseconds

06:36:45.400 --> 06:36:47.400
To see

06:36:49.880 --> 06:36:51.880
Huh, wait, whoa

06:36:52.920 --> 06:36:56.440
Skipping watching my usual streamers for stroney does a new approach

06:36:57.480 --> 06:37:01.080
You I am an endurance streamer. So if this is not your kind of game, don't worry

06:37:01.480 --> 06:37:03.480
Mercy is going live in t

06:37:03.960 --> 06:37:05.080
minus

06:37:05.080 --> 06:37:06.920
Two and a half

06:37:06.920 --> 06:37:12.120
I have never been happier to see these these guys wherever the heck they're what are they called?

06:37:12.280 --> 06:37:14.280
Let's see what they're called. Don't move

06:37:14.360 --> 06:37:19.320
A UT drone, I've never been so happy to see a UT drone

06:37:21.000 --> 06:37:22.280
Oh

06:37:22.280 --> 06:37:27.000
Depends if you go the other route. Okay. Yeah, uh, the alternative stuff. Yeah, definitely

06:37:28.440 --> 06:37:35.240
Not an inscription. Okay. I misremember. I'm hearing radio chatter. They don't most gone missing. The navi are pulling out

06:37:35.560 --> 06:37:41.640
You have anything to stress playing this game. I'm pretending. Okay. I really appreciate they already went to the ocarina time

06:37:42.600 --> 06:37:46.120
We need to hurry tensions are starting to boil over at hell's gate

06:37:47.960 --> 06:37:49.960
I was just puked up

06:37:51.480 --> 06:37:57.400
He's starting to invite scientists for questioning. I'm not sure what he's nervous about. We need to be careful

06:37:58.040 --> 06:38:01.080
If the time comes we may need to make some tough choices

06:38:03.720 --> 06:38:04.840
So

06:38:04.840 --> 06:38:10.280
Kendra wants you to report to Monroe at hell's gate if you're gonna give me 8 000 xp for showing up sure

06:38:10.840 --> 06:38:14.920
I'll go at hell's gate pretty sure there are lots of sections of everything in

06:38:17.880 --> 06:38:21.240
Vampires the masquerade and destroy all humans have hypnosis

06:38:23.160 --> 06:38:28.680
Wait vampires masquerade do you get to play as a vampire that hypnotizes people that would be kind of cool. Oh my god

06:38:30.600 --> 06:38:32.600
I'm here for that

06:38:32.680 --> 06:38:37.640
Oh, you okay. I feel like we level up so fast as rda. Maybe the rda isn't as long

06:38:37.640 --> 06:38:39.640
I

06:38:40.040 --> 06:38:46.360
Think so. Oh, that's so cool. Maybe we'll take a look at that. I've never played it or seen any gameplay of it

06:38:46.760 --> 06:38:47.880
but

06:38:47.880 --> 06:38:49.880
Uh, is that like a highly rated game

06:38:52.040 --> 06:38:55.560
Dark Souls 3 has rapport for enemy control

06:38:56.920 --> 06:39:02.680
I suppose I mean technically more door shadow and more door you can take technically like imprint

06:39:03.640 --> 06:39:05.080
enemies

06:39:05.080 --> 06:39:07.080
So they're not mean to you

06:39:07.880 --> 06:39:13.800
I'm behind on my doomsday diagnosis. This is the second phone wrong with the emulator. We could have an ecological meltdown

06:39:14.600 --> 06:39:17.800
Okay, let's hold up a sec. What the hell is this emulator?

06:39:19.080 --> 06:39:24.040
Yes, the emulator we're searching for a dormant well of souls, right now once we find it

06:39:24.120 --> 06:39:29.000
We need to communicate. Oh, they're pretending being called a first voice

06:39:29.800 --> 06:39:32.440
He's the only person who can awaken a well of souls

06:39:33.080 --> 06:39:37.640
They're pretending that the emulator isn't just a nuke

06:39:39.000 --> 06:39:46.760
Once that's done, we can control the entire ecosystem. So back to that first ecosystem. You're running a new day diagnostic

06:39:47.640 --> 06:39:53.000
Well, everything has its risk. Come now. Upload that home out. They're lying to me

06:39:53.320 --> 06:39:55.160
naughty

06:39:55.160 --> 06:39:57.160
But we're still gonna nuke the planet anyway

06:39:57.320 --> 06:40:00.280
Once they're closer to pinpointing the location of the dormant site

06:40:00.920 --> 06:40:01.560
You should check it

06:40:01.560 --> 06:40:07.720
VTM does in fact have the option to be a hypnotic vanguard and highly rated as a question as a cult classic

06:40:07.800 --> 06:40:09.800
Oh, my apology. I did not know that

06:40:10.840 --> 06:40:12.840
I hear you took down badama

06:40:13.160 --> 06:40:14.920
Nice work

06:40:14.920 --> 06:40:20.040
It's good. My need to mess with it a little to make it work though. It's old game

06:40:21.160 --> 06:40:22.920
Oh, yeah, doesn't Baldur's gate have a bunch of

06:40:23.880 --> 06:40:26.680
Oh, I'm not playing big baldies gate yet

06:40:28.360 --> 06:40:30.360
Don't start growing a brain

06:40:30.360 --> 06:40:34.680
It says it's co-op. Is it like co-op that I can bring you get you guys in and out? Or is it not that kind of co-op?

06:40:35.720 --> 06:40:38.520
The human colony and after which is pretty impressive

06:40:40.920 --> 06:40:45.080
Baldur's gate has tons of main control efficient because main flyers are a big part of the port

06:40:45.800 --> 06:40:47.320
Hmm

06:40:47.320 --> 06:40:49.320
Doesn't have main control of the game

06:40:50.520 --> 06:40:51.880
It's quite a

06:40:51.880 --> 06:40:55.240
VTM vampires masquerade is old game

06:40:55.800 --> 06:40:58.920
It's not that kind of coin. We're going to Graves bog

06:40:59.880 --> 06:41:01.240
Okay

06:41:01.240 --> 06:41:05.800
Did you know that in scots the bog is slang for the toilet?

06:41:06.840 --> 06:41:11.560
Did you know that in australia the thunderbox is slang for the toilet?

06:41:12.440 --> 06:41:14.680
I don't know what any slang for any other

06:41:16.840 --> 06:41:19.880
This voice actor sounds like grandpa max from band tan

06:41:21.080 --> 06:41:23.080
Nice to watch

06:41:31.400 --> 06:41:34.120
Oh new scary location, oh me. Oh my

06:41:35.080 --> 06:41:37.080
I

06:41:38.120 --> 06:41:42.360
Mean Baldur's gate has twitch integration. Oh, it's a shame. There's no such thing

06:41:52.280 --> 06:41:57.560
Keep not getting a good night's sleep before streams, I don't know what to do or how to stop it

06:41:59.160 --> 06:42:01.480
You know saying I have nightmares about the girls

06:42:01.960 --> 06:42:04.120
I keep waking up like way before I should

06:42:06.360 --> 06:42:08.360
I don't know how to have a good night's sleep

06:42:10.120 --> 06:42:15.960
Ashiva to drop me open I can literally see wills like kendra wants you to collect a shard from a navi village

06:42:16.280 --> 06:42:21.560
Oh a village fill a navi. Sure. Let me just go have fun. Why not drive me to the village?

06:42:22.920 --> 06:42:24.840

06:42:24.840 --> 06:42:26.840
Wait, I've already been here before. Oh, no

06:42:27.400 --> 06:42:28.440

Get my gun out. Oh

06:43:25.400 --> 06:43:30.840
x wax x axis 90 degrees animation for the rock destroy

06:43:38.040 --> 06:43:39.880
Okay, it's a big fight

06:43:39.880 --> 06:43:43.880
I'll ignore the fighting and I'll just go get the mission objective

06:43:45.400 --> 06:43:49.480
And then I'll use the xp from achieving the mission objective

06:43:51.480 --> 06:43:53.320
Uh

06:43:53.320 --> 06:43:55.320
Whoa

06:43:56.440 --> 06:43:59.960
Oh, am I burning my own guys or just him? Oh wait, there's a

06:44:02.280 --> 06:44:06.920
I'm not really sure what I feel about the flamethrower. I don't know if it's as fast as I think it should be

06:44:08.760 --> 06:44:10.760
I said I want to

06:44:10.920 --> 06:44:12.920
Do

They're at least helping you this time honestly a christmas miracle

06:44:18.680 --> 06:44:21.960

06:44:53.880 --> 06:44:57.960
You did not even give me a freaking warning that was going to go down

06:44:59.240 --> 06:45:01.240

Oh, thank goodness. I thought they weren't gonna open the gate

06:45:21.240 --> 06:45:24.920
I was like, I know you can see me right now open this open. Let me in

06:45:25.560 --> 06:45:27.560
Open the door

06:45:28.680 --> 06:45:30.200

Flames are in video game only come into flavors overpowered or a wargun on anything this fresh meat can do

Right, I'm not that see I'm not scared when I've got allies, but when I've no I'm absolutely modified

06:46:29.400 --> 06:46:36.840
The events that are unfolding five we need six. Oh, I'm getting wax. Whoa. That is a big stick

06:46:40.120 --> 06:46:42.440
Okay, I want to collect the samples

06:46:43.880 --> 06:46:45.880
Where's the shotgun? Is this?

06:46:46.360 --> 06:46:48.360
Nope, that's pistol

06:46:48.440 --> 06:46:50.440
No, that's empty. That's why

06:46:50.600 --> 06:46:52.600
Oh, whoa

06:46:53.880 --> 06:46:55.880

Is that working? I don't the flamethrower isn't like am I going crazy?

06:47:09.800 --> 06:47:12.840
I'm I'm losing it. It's not doing anything

06:47:15.880 --> 06:47:18.200
Yeah, the shotgun actually does something though

06:47:23.880 --> 06:47:26.120
Oh, there we go. There we go

06:47:30.840 --> 06:47:37.480

Yeah, the aim is to stone eggs folks

06:47:47.160 --> 06:47:49.160
Can I finish a kill please

06:47:49.640 --> 06:47:51.640
That navi just completely ignored me there

06:47:52.600 --> 06:47:58.040
I mean, I'll take it a layer north gate is under attack. Oh, we have more

06:47:59.240 --> 06:48:01.240
Where what one here?

06:48:03.240 --> 06:48:04.920
North gate

06:48:04.920 --> 06:48:06.280
Oh

06:48:06.280 --> 06:48:09.400
I just looked at north on the hide. I'm like, hmm, where would the north gate be?

06:48:09.720 --> 06:48:13.080
Me hapsich would be facing north this shotgun

06:48:14.040 --> 06:48:16.040
Oh

06:48:16.600 --> 06:48:21.240
Is that we literally just did a synchronized dance there

06:48:25.000 --> 06:48:27.000
Yeah, I wish

06:48:27.480 --> 06:48:29.480
Literally synchronized dance

Go ahead on skull moment. Good. Oh

06:48:33.400 --> 06:48:35.400
Jesus

06:48:35.640 --> 06:48:37.640
That's like never ending

06:48:38.600 --> 06:48:41.480
And I can hardly see them because they're invisible half the time

06:48:43.320 --> 06:48:45.640
Oh, I'm hardly getting the credit for killing them

06:48:47.560 --> 06:48:50.440
Is there carrots I can climb up yet?

06:48:52.520 --> 06:48:58.200
There's no ladder climb on those carrots. They're just for what? Oh, there's one over here. Hold on

06:48:58.920 --> 06:49:06.360
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. This might make things a lot easier. Let's try it. Let's try it. Let's try it

06:49:07.240 --> 06:49:09.240
Oh

06:49:09.880 --> 06:49:11.880
My god, can I

06:49:12.680 --> 06:49:14.680
No, that's friendly

06:49:14.840 --> 06:49:17.160
Oh my god, this is so much easier. Are you joking me?

06:49:19.320 --> 06:49:21.320
Uh, I've been struggling for how long

06:49:24.920 --> 06:49:29.800
Oh, this is too simplistic. No, I missed that guy, but it's still

06:49:29.800 --> 06:49:35.560
Yeah, and they keep stealing my kills

06:49:37.400 --> 06:49:39.400
Oh

06:49:41.880 --> 06:49:46.280
Okay, three and done. This is the last one. There's no way get me off this

06:49:49.320 --> 06:49:51.640
I have two razes. I do need to try and

06:49:53.000 --> 06:49:55.960
Yeah, sorry. I'm ignoring everything and

06:49:56.840 --> 06:50:01.720
Well, I would ignore everything if you get you weren't perfectly you're blocking the way

06:50:02.680 --> 06:50:04.440
Grunt

06:50:04.440 --> 06:50:06.440

06:50:11.080 --> 06:50:14.280
Okay, okay, let's let's yeah, let's go

06:50:16.280 --> 06:50:18.280
Let me progress

06:50:20.200 --> 06:50:23.400
Oh, this is so why on earth that I don't think of this sooner

06:50:23.400 --> 06:50:28.400
Reflings! Why didn't you suggest this? You're supposed to be holding my hand!

06:50:31.400 --> 06:50:36.400
Oh, I'm going to need catch up on chat, honestly. I feel like I'm going to have to sing to beat you.

06:50:38.400 --> 06:50:40.400
I'm going to have to sing.

06:50:41.400 --> 06:50:43.400
Oh, right.

06:50:44.400 --> 06:50:47.400
Oh, done. Jeez, Louise!

06:50:48.400 --> 06:50:53.400
Sorry if I'm not part of the 20 players that won this game. RIP. I can't believe it. It's such a legendary game.

06:50:54.400 --> 06:50:57.400
I can't even say I recommend, like, all go out and buy it.

06:50:58.400 --> 06:51:02.400
The experience, for me, is more nostalgia, although this part is, like, actually...

06:51:03.400 --> 06:51:06.400
Like, I'm actually, like, having a challenge playing this part.

06:51:08.400 --> 06:51:10.400
I'm still in disbelief. The game even exists.

06:51:11.400 --> 06:51:16.400
Your hands are on the controller. B-legs didn't sell the turret.

06:51:17.400 --> 06:51:19.400
Oh, the jet didn't see the turret. Sorry, sorry.

06:51:24.400 --> 06:51:25.400
You're doing good!

06:51:26.400 --> 06:51:28.400
I've got two songs.

06:51:29.400 --> 06:51:31.400
I think, so far.

06:51:34.400 --> 06:51:38.400
Shawnee, by the way, you missed the cutscene gate flying like a rocket launcher, honestly.

06:51:39.400 --> 06:51:47.400
Yeah, you leveled so far. I wonder if the RDA mission is actually, like, smaller than the main.

06:51:48.400 --> 06:51:52.400
Wait, I want to unlock the fast travel before I take off, just in case.

06:51:53.400 --> 06:51:55.400
Level up!

06:51:59.400 --> 06:52:03.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Did she say whoops? I like you too, Ryder.

06:52:04.400 --> 06:52:08.400
Whoa. Wait, I'm not driving? Oh, thank god.

06:52:09.400 --> 06:52:11.400
Alright, let's see how this develops.

06:52:15.400 --> 06:52:18.400
Oh, the aim is a bit...

06:52:19.400 --> 06:52:21.400
In front of us! Are you drunk?

06:52:23.400 --> 06:52:25.400
Are you drunk?!

06:52:27.400 --> 06:52:30.400
Did I just ignore the ones from behind, or...?

06:52:31.400 --> 06:52:34.400
What's the deal? Did I just go for it?

06:52:36.400 --> 06:52:39.400
Is this just an XP run? I think it's just an XP run.

06:52:40.400 --> 06:52:43.400
I'll just destroy everything, have a look at that.

06:52:45.400 --> 06:52:47.400
Oh, my gosh.

06:52:48.400 --> 06:52:50.400
Oh, no.

06:52:54.400 --> 06:52:57.400
Oh, that's getting... that's so loud in my head. Holy crap.

06:52:58.400 --> 06:53:00.400
Is it too loud for stream?

06:53:01.400 --> 06:53:04.400
That's, like, just a little deafening.

06:53:06.400 --> 06:53:09.400
Okay, this just looks like an XP farm run. I'm gonna say it, but...

06:53:11.400 --> 06:53:14.400
I can't even see what's ahead of me. There's so much.

06:53:20.400 --> 06:53:22.400
Oh, excuse me. Oh, no.

06:53:23.400 --> 06:53:26.400
Whoa! I didn't even know you were just riding those like that.

06:53:28.400 --> 06:53:31.400
Oh. What's going on? What's going on?

06:53:33.400 --> 06:53:35.400
Are they...?

06:53:36.400 --> 06:53:38.400
Oh!

06:53:40.400 --> 06:53:45.400
The camera angle is like... I'm not even driving. Who's driving this warthog?

06:53:46.400 --> 06:53:48.400
That's a terrible job of it.

06:53:49.400 --> 06:53:51.400
Oh, I'm overheating. Oops.

06:53:52.400 --> 06:53:54.400
Hold on.

06:53:55.400 --> 06:53:59.400
Overheating. I'm getting a little too overzealous with this weaponry, okay?

06:54:03.400 --> 06:54:04.400
Oh.

06:54:07.400 --> 06:54:13.400
This is just annihilation. I'm starting to feel bad for the Navi, like, as much as they're annoying when they're trying to kill me.

06:54:19.400 --> 06:54:20.400
Oh.

06:54:20.400 --> 06:54:23.400
As they hold them all clear, I can't see.

06:54:24.400 --> 06:54:26.400
Oh, God! They're everywhere!

06:54:33.400 --> 06:54:35.400
Oh, I don't know if I'm going to make this alive.

06:54:37.400 --> 06:54:40.400
I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying.

06:54:42.400 --> 06:54:44.400
It's hard.

06:54:47.400 --> 06:54:49.400
Oh, my goodness.

06:54:50.400 --> 06:54:52.400
Can I see?

06:54:53.400 --> 06:54:57.400
Oh, it's a blue plant. I keep thinking it's a Navi. It's a blue plant. That's, like, right there.

06:54:59.400 --> 06:55:02.400
Come on! Start the car!

06:55:03.400 --> 06:55:07.400
There's only so much back and forth I can do before we actually perish. Seriously?

06:55:09.400 --> 06:55:12.400
Oh, my goodness. Right. It seems like they're just falling back in.

06:55:13.400 --> 06:55:15.400
Thank God. Right. Don't do that again.

06:55:16.400 --> 06:55:18.400
Get the hell out of here!

06:55:19.400 --> 06:55:22.400
I'm sorry I yelled at you, sweetheart, he says, to the car.

06:55:24.400 --> 06:55:27.400
Reeflings, I'm sorry I yelled at you, sweetheart.

06:55:28.400 --> 06:55:32.400
I just get stressed when I'm playing the bad guys and everything's all skewed.

06:55:33.400 --> 06:55:35.400
I'm sorry if I skewed.

06:55:39.400 --> 06:55:40.400
What?

06:55:41.400 --> 06:55:43.400
Oh, I don't want that to break.

06:55:46.400 --> 06:55:48.400
She's doing her best for humanity.

06:55:50.400 --> 06:55:52.400
I'm absolutely denying it.

06:55:53.400 --> 06:55:55.400
Denying it? Sorry. Destroying it.

06:55:58.400 --> 06:56:00.400
If I'm getting XP,

06:56:05.400 --> 06:56:07.400
the first things are running away.

06:56:07.400 --> 06:56:08.400
Right.

06:56:12.400 --> 06:56:15.400
That's my car. That's one of more guys.

06:56:16.400 --> 06:56:17.400
I didn't even know.

06:56:19.400 --> 06:56:21.400
Oh, first things.

06:56:22.400 --> 06:56:27.400
I just feel bad. I feel like we're entering a zoo and then just executing all the animals inside the zoo.

06:56:29.400 --> 06:56:31.400
This is what this run feels like, honestly.

06:56:33.400 --> 06:56:35.400
Like, they're literally running away now.

06:56:38.400 --> 06:56:39.400
Yeah.

06:56:40.400 --> 06:56:43.400
All for XP, so I can unlock a new armor. Why not?

06:56:49.400 --> 06:56:51.400
Perish that plan.

06:56:52.400 --> 06:56:54.400
In front, are you do- Oh!

06:56:57.400 --> 06:56:58.400
Is that supposed to happen?

06:57:02.400 --> 06:57:05.400
What a unique game mode to say the least.

06:57:05.400 --> 06:57:09.400
I think you see about three of these guys if you play Navi,

06:57:09.400 --> 06:57:13.400
and you see 100 on this one section of the game alone.

06:57:19.400 --> 06:57:21.400
We're strum-beast-pulling.

06:57:22.400 --> 06:57:26.400
That's where it's been. Oh my god. That was...

06:57:27.400 --> 06:57:31.400
That was a slaughter. I'm not even happy with that. That was awful.

06:57:35.400 --> 06:57:36.400
I'm bad.

06:57:48.400 --> 06:57:52.400
This is why the Navi section has so few human campaign colors.

06:57:52.400 --> 06:57:54.400
Now you know why you don't see them in this.

06:57:55.400 --> 06:57:56.400
Oh!

06:57:57.400 --> 06:58:03.400
Is it like all this damage is being done and we're just coming at the back end of it?

06:58:05.400 --> 06:58:08.400
Aw, that actually makes so much sense.

06:58:11.400 --> 06:58:17.400
We basically come in when they're at the end of the losing fight and we turn the tide.

06:58:19.400 --> 06:58:20.400
Okay.

06:58:21.400 --> 06:58:23.400
Oh my god, that's so smart.

06:58:24.400 --> 06:58:29.400
I didn't give the devs team as much benefit as they do, but that's so smart.

06:58:30.400 --> 06:58:34.400
Don't let him... I was gonna say don't let him kill you,

06:58:34.400 --> 06:58:37.400
because he's gonna aggro to me and I can just tell he is.

06:58:38.400 --> 06:58:40.400
Oh wait, hold on. I'm trying to go.

06:58:40.400 --> 06:58:42.400
Hold on a minute. Let me...

06:58:43.400 --> 06:58:44.400
There we go.

06:58:45.400 --> 06:58:47.400
I'll just let him get in the back end.

06:58:47.400 --> 06:58:49.400
What new drift have we got?

06:58:49.400 --> 06:58:53.400
Wait, I think we're about to unlock the new one, because now our arms are on short

06:58:53.400 --> 06:58:55.400
and I'm like, that's the opposite of what I want.

06:58:55.400 --> 06:58:57.400
It does. I hate her.

06:58:58.400 --> 06:59:01.400
Oh, no clue if it's kind of, it's just a joke of mine.

06:59:01.400 --> 06:59:04.400
I mean it may be, because literally you only see two of them.

06:59:05.400 --> 06:59:07.400
Alright, where do I need to go?

06:59:07.400 --> 06:59:10.400
Well, I'm taking a car for that.

06:59:10.400 --> 06:59:11.400
I'm not taking that by foot.

06:59:11.400 --> 06:59:13.400
Can I drive this?

06:59:15.400 --> 06:59:17.400
Kendra?

06:59:18.400 --> 06:59:21.400
How do I shoot? I don't know. Can I drive him over?

06:59:21.400 --> 06:59:22.400
Oh, that was...

06:59:22.400 --> 06:59:25.400
I was actually really mean. I shouldn't have gone that far.

06:59:25.400 --> 06:59:27.400
I kind of deserved it.

06:59:27.400 --> 06:59:30.400
What are all those things? Are those reports?

06:59:34.400 --> 06:59:37.400
So can I not shoot? I don't think I can.

06:59:37.400 --> 06:59:39.400
I think I can only drive.

06:59:39.400 --> 06:59:41.400
I'm driving this buggy.

06:59:41.400 --> 06:59:43.400
That's like such a long way to go.

06:59:44.400 --> 06:59:48.400
I'll go on the outskirts to get the...

06:59:50.400 --> 06:59:53.400
like uncovered map thing.

06:59:53.400 --> 06:59:55.400
I actually smished him against the wall.

06:59:58.400 --> 07:00:00.400
I can't go that way.

07:00:01.400 --> 07:00:05.400
This is so much more responsive than the buggy I have to admit.

07:00:05.400 --> 07:00:08.400
I like that they make that differentiation.

07:00:12.400 --> 07:00:13.400
Okay.

07:00:13.400 --> 07:00:15.400
We can go this way.

07:00:15.400 --> 07:00:19.400
I thought we couldn't consider the way the map made it look, but we...

07:00:19.400 --> 07:00:21.400
No, I did not just do that.

07:00:21.400 --> 07:00:23.400
Oh, I did not just do that.

07:00:24.400 --> 07:00:26.400
I freaking did!

07:00:27.400 --> 07:00:29.400
No, no, no.

07:00:30.400 --> 07:00:31.400
Hello, game.

07:00:31.400 --> 07:00:33.400
Oh my gosh.

07:00:35.400 --> 07:00:40.400
Oh, this is the worst thing that could have happened has not happened.

07:00:41.400 --> 07:00:44.400
Door stock, literally door stock.

07:00:44.400 --> 07:00:46.400
And I have to do all of this on foot,

07:00:46.400 --> 07:00:49.400
whilst everything is aggressive to me.

07:00:50.400 --> 07:00:52.400
Right, how much further do I have to go?

07:00:52.400 --> 07:00:53.400
Just leave it for it.

07:00:53.400 --> 07:00:54.400
Just down the street.

07:00:54.400 --> 07:00:55.400
It's fine.

07:00:55.400 --> 07:00:57.400
I just need to pop down the street.

07:00:57.400 --> 07:00:58.400
It's like going to the corner shop.

07:00:58.400 --> 07:01:00.400
It's just around the corner.

07:01:00.400 --> 07:01:02.400
It's okay.

07:01:02.400 --> 07:01:04.400
You can just teleport down.

07:01:04.400 --> 07:01:06.400
I can't because I've not unlocked whatever it is.

07:01:06.400 --> 07:01:08.400
It's not unlocked.

07:01:10.400 --> 07:01:11.400
Is it quiet?

07:01:11.400 --> 07:01:13.400
Is it safe question mark?

07:01:13.400 --> 07:01:16.400
Other than the fly trap?

07:01:17.400 --> 07:01:18.400
Just a little bit more.

07:01:18.400 --> 07:01:20.400
All is good.

07:01:20.400 --> 07:01:22.400
This is called Sniper's Point

07:01:22.400 --> 07:01:24.400
implying that there's Sniper Navi

07:01:24.400 --> 07:01:26.400
looking at me right now, question mark.

07:01:27.400 --> 07:01:29.400
The ho-hum.

07:01:29.400 --> 07:01:30.400
Okay.

07:01:30.400 --> 07:01:31.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:01:31.400 --> 07:01:32.400
Something's getting me.

07:01:32.400 --> 07:01:33.400
I don't want.

07:01:33.400 --> 07:01:34.400
A fly?

07:01:34.400 --> 07:01:35.400
A fly got me.

07:01:35.400 --> 07:01:36.400
A mosquito.

07:01:36.400 --> 07:01:37.400
A mosquito got me.

07:01:37.400 --> 07:01:38.400
Oh!

07:01:38.400 --> 07:01:39.400
Whoa.

07:01:39.400 --> 07:01:40.400
Look at it.

07:01:40.400 --> 07:01:42.400
Freaking ready to like get me already.

07:01:43.400 --> 07:01:45.400
I'll wait until my invis comes back.

07:01:45.400 --> 07:01:46.400
Yeah.

07:01:46.400 --> 07:01:47.400
Yeah, that's right.

07:01:47.400 --> 07:01:48.400
Go back to sleep.

07:01:48.400 --> 07:01:49.400
Yep.

07:01:49.400 --> 07:01:50.400
Stinky.

07:01:50.400 --> 07:01:51.400
Stinky plant.

07:01:51.400 --> 07:01:52.400
I don't like you.

07:01:52.400 --> 07:01:54.400
Abandoned RDA camp.

07:01:54.400 --> 07:01:55.400
Well, that doesn't...

07:01:55.400 --> 07:01:56.400
That doesn't...

07:01:56.400 --> 07:01:57.400
This is just...

07:01:58.400 --> 07:01:59.400
This is not good for me.

07:01:59.400 --> 07:02:00.400
I can tell you that much.

07:02:00.400 --> 07:02:02.400
This is absolutely awful for me.

07:02:02.400 --> 07:02:05.400
I will take the teleport point

07:02:05.400 --> 07:02:07.400
just so I don't have to do that again.

07:02:07.400 --> 07:02:08.400
Um...

07:02:10.400 --> 07:02:11.400
Um...

07:02:12.400 --> 07:02:13.400
Can I hide here?

07:02:14.400 --> 07:02:16.400
Well, he looks pretty enraged to me.

07:02:17.400 --> 07:02:18.400
Um...

07:02:20.400 --> 07:02:21.400
I have nowhere.

07:02:21.400 --> 07:02:22.400
I'm gonna go up.

07:02:22.400 --> 07:02:23.400
Oh no, I can't go up.

07:02:23.400 --> 07:02:24.400
I'm too small.

07:02:26.400 --> 07:02:27.400
Where...

07:02:27.400 --> 07:02:29.400
Where's the crystal, guys?

07:02:29.400 --> 07:02:30.400
I don't really want to go.

07:02:30.400 --> 07:02:31.400
Abandoned hope.

07:02:31.400 --> 07:02:34.400
Yo, ye who may enter from the floor.

07:02:34.400 --> 07:02:35.400
Finger.

07:02:35.400 --> 07:02:36.400
But hole.

07:02:36.400 --> 07:02:37.400
Oh.

07:02:38.400 --> 07:02:40.400
There's this to spray them down.

07:02:42.400 --> 07:02:43.400
Hmm.

07:02:44.400 --> 07:02:45.400
Okay.

07:02:51.400 --> 07:02:53.400
Did they just run away from me now?

07:02:57.400 --> 07:02:58.400
Okay.

07:02:59.400 --> 07:03:02.400
Okay, not too bad if I have a tulile.

07:03:02.400 --> 07:03:04.400
I really destroy all this stuff too.

07:03:04.400 --> 07:03:05.400
I mean, it's 10 XP.

07:03:05.400 --> 07:03:08.400
I'm not really sure it's worth taking the time to do that.

07:03:09.400 --> 07:03:11.400
I will try and clear up this area

07:03:11.400 --> 07:03:14.400
because if I'm trying to find a crystal in the middle,

07:03:14.400 --> 07:03:15.400
I'm still free jumping.

07:03:15.400 --> 07:03:17.400
I don't even know where I'm supposed to look.

07:03:20.400 --> 07:03:22.400
Oh, now you come around the corner.

07:03:22.400 --> 07:03:24.400
Nah, you're such a liar.

07:03:24.400 --> 07:03:25.400
You're actually such a liar.

07:03:25.400 --> 07:03:26.400
You're telling fivers.

07:03:26.400 --> 07:03:28.400
Why would you come around the corner now

07:03:28.400 --> 07:03:30.400
after I'd already sprayed you?

07:03:31.400 --> 07:03:33.400
Where on earth is this...

07:03:33.400 --> 07:03:34.400
thing?

07:03:36.400 --> 07:03:38.400
And he's already AI locked onto me.

07:03:38.400 --> 07:03:40.400
I don't know why the game pretend to be otherwise.

07:03:41.400 --> 07:03:43.400
Is there another turret over here that I can use?

07:03:44.400 --> 07:03:46.400
I know the things back in that other section.

07:03:46.400 --> 07:03:47.400
I'm just wondering what's up here.

07:03:47.400 --> 07:03:49.400
Why is there a dead end?

07:03:50.400 --> 07:03:53.400
Oh, and it's just like one of these things.

07:03:53.400 --> 07:03:54.400
Jeez.

07:03:55.400 --> 07:03:56.400
That gorilla.

07:03:59.400 --> 07:04:00.400
It's just abandoned.

07:04:00.400 --> 07:04:02.400
Kind of showing you it's old.

07:04:03.400 --> 07:04:04.400
Abandoned...

07:04:05.400 --> 07:04:06.400
Dog.

07:04:06.400 --> 07:04:07.400
Pet dog.

07:04:08.400 --> 07:04:09.400
It's a turtle.

07:04:10.400 --> 07:04:14.400
I have no idea what's hecking crystal on Zoom right now.

07:04:16.400 --> 07:04:19.400
It's already aggroed to me but I can't see.

07:04:20.400 --> 07:04:23.400
Maybe inside that building and that's why it's like flashing?

07:04:23.400 --> 07:04:24.400
Okay.

07:04:31.400 --> 07:04:32.400
Oh, pardon me.

07:04:35.400 --> 07:04:38.400
I'm gonna go invisible and see if I can shoot it from that turret

07:04:38.400 --> 07:04:40.400
or is it already glued onto me?

07:04:40.400 --> 07:04:41.400
No.

07:04:45.400 --> 07:04:46.400
Is it in here?

07:04:49.400 --> 07:04:52.400
Bro, where is this freaking cell sample?

07:04:52.400 --> 07:04:53.400
I don't know.

07:04:54.400 --> 07:04:57.400
I'm gonna see if I can get rid of that last guy with this

07:04:57.400 --> 07:04:58.400
because he...

07:04:58.400 --> 07:05:00.400
I just saw a second one.

07:05:01.400 --> 07:05:03.400
Wait, let's get rid of you

07:05:03.400 --> 07:05:04.400
because you're in Moe.

07:05:04.400 --> 07:05:05.400
You're in Moe.

07:05:05.400 --> 07:05:06.400
You're in Moe.

07:05:06.400 --> 07:05:07.400
You're in Moe.

07:05:11.400 --> 07:05:12.400
Right.

07:05:12.400 --> 07:05:13.400
No.

07:05:13.400 --> 07:05:16.400
I think wherever the heck it is, it's somewhere over here.

07:05:16.400 --> 07:05:17.400
It's not been here yet.

07:05:19.400 --> 07:05:20.400
Right.

07:05:23.400 --> 07:05:24.400
I hate you.

07:05:25.400 --> 07:05:27.400
What, even if you're invisible?

07:05:27.400 --> 07:05:29.400
Oh, he's got protection prior on.

07:05:29.400 --> 07:05:30.400
I can see it.

07:05:30.400 --> 07:05:31.400
That's what that bloom means.

07:05:32.400 --> 07:05:33.400
Boy.

07:05:34.400 --> 07:05:35.400
Here.

07:05:35.400 --> 07:05:36.400
Oh, I just...

07:05:38.400 --> 07:05:39.400
What did I get?

07:05:39.400 --> 07:05:41.400
I got new armor and speed four.

07:05:41.400 --> 07:05:42.400
I'll take that.

07:05:44.400 --> 07:05:47.400
Bro, am I actually gonna have to look up a tutorial?

07:05:52.400 --> 07:05:53.400
That was big.

07:05:54.400 --> 07:05:55.400
I've got a different outfit.

07:05:55.400 --> 07:05:56.400
I'm like...

07:05:59.400 --> 07:06:00.400
It's not that way.

07:06:00.400 --> 07:06:03.400
It's out of bounds over there, basically.

07:06:05.400 --> 07:06:07.400
It's not like up here.

07:06:08.400 --> 07:06:09.400
Whoa, sorry.

07:06:09.400 --> 07:06:10.400
Sorry.

07:06:10.400 --> 07:06:11.400
I wasn't paying attention.

07:06:11.400 --> 07:06:12.400
Is it up?

07:06:12.400 --> 07:06:13.400
Should it be up?

07:06:14.400 --> 07:06:17.400
Where the heck is this one thing?

07:06:17.400 --> 07:06:18.400
Hmm.

07:06:20.400 --> 07:06:22.400
No, don't spray on me.

07:06:23.400 --> 07:06:25.400
Now's not time for that.

07:06:28.400 --> 07:06:29.400
Hello.

07:06:30.400 --> 07:06:34.400
We're currently looking for something that my blind eyes cannot perceive.

07:06:37.400 --> 07:06:42.400
It says it's somewhere in this area and I keep perfectly avoiding it, whatever it is.

07:06:44.400 --> 07:06:45.400
Okay.

07:06:45.400 --> 07:06:48.400
Now the avatars are coming in this area?

07:06:48.400 --> 07:06:49.400
Is it inside that, maybe?

07:06:49.400 --> 07:06:51.400
Maybe it's inside this one, whatever it is.

07:06:53.400 --> 07:06:54.400
It's in the building.

07:06:54.400 --> 07:06:55.400
Oh.

07:06:56.400 --> 07:06:59.400
If it's in this one, I'm gonna be mad because I went in the other one.

07:06:59.400 --> 07:07:02.400
Oh, for goodness' sake, thank you.

07:07:02.400 --> 07:07:04.400
What are the odds?

07:07:05.400 --> 07:07:07.400
Right, finally got there in the end.

07:07:08.400 --> 07:07:11.400
And of course there's not fast travel with that guy because that would be too easy, wouldn't it?

07:07:15.400 --> 07:07:16.400
Ugh.

07:07:17.400 --> 07:07:20.400
That speed is fast though, like I'm pretty speedy.

07:07:21.400 --> 07:07:24.400
Of course it was in the building that I wasn't looking at.

07:07:25.400 --> 07:07:27.400
How could I be such a silly sausage?

07:07:27.400 --> 07:07:29.400
I was beating up my car.

07:07:30.400 --> 07:07:32.400
Yeah, I had to put a down payment on that.

07:07:33.400 --> 07:07:35.400
Right, this is gonna be off topic.

07:07:36.400 --> 07:07:38.400
I don't know if you guys have been watching.

07:07:39.400 --> 07:07:43.400
There's this YouTuber that looks at people's finances, like for entertainment.

07:07:43.400 --> 07:07:46.400
But he always shouts at them for having a car.

07:07:46.400 --> 07:07:51.400
And I didn't realize that car loans were like really predatory in America.

07:07:52.400 --> 07:07:56.400
Where they like make you pay like a ridiculous like percentage and stuff.

07:07:56.400 --> 07:07:58.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:07:58.400 --> 07:08:00.400
You just relax, little flies, you just relax.

07:08:01.400 --> 07:08:02.400
Thank you.

07:08:02.400 --> 07:08:03.400
Thank you.

07:08:05.400 --> 07:08:06.400
And me two more?

07:08:06.400 --> 07:08:09.400
No, one more crystal and then I'm good to go.

07:08:10.400 --> 07:08:11.400
You two, huh?

07:08:11.400 --> 07:08:14.400
One, and it took four tenths, bad day for bets.

07:08:14.400 --> 07:08:15.400
It seems no.

07:08:16.400 --> 07:08:18.400
Don't be getting, don't be betting on me honestly.

07:08:19.400 --> 07:08:22.400
I want you to collect the shard from a nearby Navi village.

07:08:22.400 --> 07:08:25.400
Okay, let's give it a shot.

07:08:26.400 --> 07:08:31.400
I believe this is the second last shard collection map.

07:08:31.400 --> 07:08:34.400
And then we've done the campaign unbelievably.

07:08:35.400 --> 07:08:40.400
We are just going for it.

07:08:41.400 --> 07:08:43.400
I love being ignored in battle.

07:08:43.400 --> 07:08:44.400
Yay.

07:08:44.400 --> 07:08:47.400
I love going so fast that the enemies don't target me.

07:08:47.400 --> 07:08:48.400
Yay.

07:08:51.400 --> 07:08:53.400
I love not being a part of the fight.

07:08:53.400 --> 07:08:55.400
Ow, he just spanked my butt.

07:08:58.400 --> 07:08:59.400
Good night.

07:08:59.400 --> 07:09:01.400
Rest well, those who need to sleep.

07:09:01.400 --> 07:09:04.400
Sorry about kind of the surprise endurance stream.

07:09:04.400 --> 07:09:06.400
I thought it was only going to be four hours.

07:09:06.400 --> 07:09:07.400
What were we at?

07:09:09.400 --> 07:09:11.400
We're at seven hours?

07:09:11.400 --> 07:09:12.400
Oh my gosh.

07:09:12.400 --> 07:09:13.400
Sorry.

07:09:14.400 --> 07:09:15.400
Sorry to anyone.

07:09:15.400 --> 07:09:17.400
Good night and rest well, those who need to go.

07:09:17.400 --> 07:09:19.400
Please do not stay up against your health.

07:09:19.400 --> 07:09:20.400
Just watch.

07:09:20.400 --> 07:09:23.400
The vaude will be remaining for you soon, TM.

07:09:32.400 --> 07:09:35.400
You must kill Tanjala before you collect the harmonic and the willow tree.

07:09:35.400 --> 07:09:37.400
Right, we've got a boss fight.

07:09:37.400 --> 07:09:38.400
But we can do it.

07:09:38.400 --> 07:09:39.400
We can do it.

07:09:39.400 --> 07:09:41.400
We can do it if we put our mind to.

07:09:41.400 --> 07:09:43.400
We can do...

07:09:43.400 --> 07:09:44.400
Where am I?

07:09:44.400 --> 07:09:45.400
I'm not trying to go.

07:09:45.400 --> 07:09:47.400
I'm behind a tent right now.

07:09:47.400 --> 07:09:50.400
Living up to the endurance streamer tag anyway.

07:09:50.400 --> 07:09:51.400
Yeah.

07:09:52.400 --> 07:09:59.400
I wonder how many people didn't realize when I said endurance streamer

07:09:59.400 --> 07:10:03.400
I meant endurance streamer.

07:10:03.400 --> 07:10:04.400
Okay.

07:10:05.400 --> 07:10:06.400
Right, where am I doing?

07:10:06.400 --> 07:10:07.400
Just kind of...

07:10:07.400 --> 07:10:08.400
Kind of half...

07:10:08.400 --> 07:10:09.400
Hold the map.

07:10:09.400 --> 07:10:10.400
Oh!

07:10:10.400 --> 07:10:13.400
Oh, I'm in the battlefield by accident.

07:10:17.400 --> 07:10:19.400
Stromer, look at this child.

07:10:22.400 --> 07:10:24.400
Tanjala near me.

07:10:24.400 --> 07:10:25.400
What a surprise.

07:10:26.400 --> 07:10:29.400
Look at my speed.

07:10:29.400 --> 07:10:31.400
My speed is amazing.

07:10:31.400 --> 07:10:33.400
I'm a super soldier.

07:10:34.400 --> 07:10:36.400
It tastes like raisins.

07:10:38.400 --> 07:10:41.400
I was surprised but I haven't missed them at how.

07:10:41.400 --> 07:10:42.400
Oh my God.

07:10:45.400 --> 07:10:47.400
I have streamed a heck of a lot of time.

07:10:47.400 --> 07:10:49.400
I feel like maybe.

07:10:55.400 --> 07:10:56.400
Watch yourself.

07:11:00.400 --> 07:11:02.400
I can't even see the enemy.

07:11:02.400 --> 07:11:03.400
You know that?

07:11:03.400 --> 07:11:04.400
I actually can't.

07:11:04.400 --> 07:11:05.400
I'm not being funny.

07:11:05.400 --> 07:11:10.400
I didn't mean to good battle but I genuinely can't see the enemy.

07:11:10.400 --> 07:11:12.400
What do you want me to do?

07:11:12.400 --> 07:11:13.400
Oh, no way.

07:11:13.400 --> 07:11:16.400
I've just engaged the boss fight.

07:11:16.400 --> 07:11:17.400
Stop.

07:11:17.400 --> 07:11:18.400
Stop.

07:11:18.400 --> 07:11:21.400
I've engaged the boss fight and there's literally a billion...

07:11:21.400 --> 07:11:24.400
I didn't even see you.

07:11:24.400 --> 07:11:27.400
You're going to make me pee myself, please.

07:11:27.400 --> 07:11:28.400
Oh my God.

07:11:28.400 --> 07:11:29.400
I think I need flamethrower to like...

07:11:29.400 --> 07:11:30.400
Oh my God.

07:11:30.400 --> 07:11:32.400
I'm just getting absolutely gang violence here.

07:11:32.400 --> 07:11:34.400
What am I supposed to do?

07:11:34.400 --> 07:11:36.400
I need pop malts.

07:11:36.400 --> 07:11:37.400
I need pop malts.

07:11:37.400 --> 07:11:39.400
I need pop malts like right now.

07:11:39.400 --> 07:11:43.400
They're all using freaking prayer protection.

07:11:43.400 --> 07:11:44.400
I'm out of mana.

07:11:44.400 --> 07:11:45.400
I'm out of mana.

07:11:45.400 --> 07:11:49.400
I actually can't do prayer protection because I'm out of mana.

07:11:49.400 --> 07:11:55.400
I'm running out of freaking strength potion as if we were playing rescapes right now.

07:11:55.400 --> 07:11:57.400
Oh my gosh.

07:11:57.400 --> 07:11:58.400
What have I done?

07:11:58.400 --> 07:12:00.400
What have I done?

07:12:00.400 --> 07:12:01.400
What have I done?

07:12:01.400 --> 07:12:03.400
I've just dived into the enemy.

07:12:03.400 --> 07:12:07.400
I literally can't see them for half the time.

07:12:07.400 --> 07:12:12.400
Oh and there's someone sniping me from behind as well.

07:12:12.400 --> 07:12:14.400
No, sorry, but no.

07:12:14.400 --> 07:12:15.400
It's just no on.

07:12:15.400 --> 07:12:21.400
You can't even just snake me from halfway across the map.

07:12:21.400 --> 07:12:23.400
Why did that one run away?

07:12:23.400 --> 07:12:24.400
I have no idea.

07:12:24.400 --> 07:12:27.400
I'm guessing that ranged or whatever.

07:12:27.400 --> 07:12:32.400
The sniper one is still wound for me, but at least that other one ran away.

07:12:32.400 --> 07:12:35.400
Okay, that's the problem I have with the snipers.

07:12:35.400 --> 07:12:36.400
They can do that.

07:12:36.400 --> 07:12:37.400
Yes.

07:12:37.400 --> 07:12:39.400
Thank you for coming freaking point blank.

07:12:39.400 --> 07:12:40.400
Why?

07:12:40.400 --> 07:12:41.400
Oh wow.

07:12:41.400 --> 07:12:44.400
Tangela pushed me so far out of his battle area.

07:12:44.400 --> 07:12:46.400
He has literally...

07:12:46.400 --> 07:12:47.400
DC?

07:12:47.400 --> 07:12:48.400
No.

07:12:48.400 --> 07:12:51.400
I can see that other NPC though.

07:12:51.400 --> 07:12:53.400
Can I shoot him once?

07:12:53.400 --> 07:12:55.400
Oh, that's the flamethrower darling.

07:12:55.400 --> 07:12:57.400
That's the shotgun.

07:12:57.400 --> 07:12:58.400
Can I?

07:12:58.400 --> 07:12:59.400
I just want him.

07:12:59.400 --> 07:13:02.400
There we go.

07:13:02.400 --> 07:13:03.400
Okay.

07:13:03.400 --> 07:13:04.400
There we go.

07:13:04.400 --> 07:13:06.400
I just wanted him to attack me.

07:13:06.400 --> 07:13:09.400
No one else.

07:13:09.400 --> 07:13:13.400
Okay, let's take it nice and easy.

07:13:13.400 --> 07:13:16.400
She says that she gets caught in the tree.

07:13:16.400 --> 07:13:17.400
No, that...

07:13:17.400 --> 07:13:18.400
No.

07:13:18.400 --> 07:13:19.400
Shotgun.

07:13:19.400 --> 07:13:20.400
Shotgun.

07:13:20.400 --> 07:13:21.400
No, no, no, no, no, no.

07:13:21.400 --> 07:13:22.400
I missed.

07:13:22.400 --> 07:13:24.400
Okay, this is what I want.

07:13:24.400 --> 07:13:29.400
The shotgun stagger is exactly what I'm looking for right now.

07:13:29.400 --> 07:13:30.400
It can be...

07:13:30.400 --> 07:13:32.400
What's the name of a shotgun?

07:13:32.400 --> 07:13:34.400
It can be a spad.

07:13:34.400 --> 07:13:36.400
12 is the name of a shotgun.

07:13:36.400 --> 07:13:39.400
A stakeout is the name of a shotgun.

07:13:39.400 --> 07:13:41.400
Another gun.

07:13:41.400 --> 07:13:45.400
I don't remember any other ones off the top of my head.

07:13:45.400 --> 07:13:50.400
Not very good with gun names unless they're in Black Ops 1 and all, honestly.

07:13:50.400 --> 07:13:53.400
Famous, AK-47.

07:13:53.400 --> 07:13:55.400
Sub-machine guns.

07:13:55.400 --> 07:13:57.400
Susies.

07:13:57.400 --> 07:14:00.400
AK-47U.

07:14:00.400 --> 07:14:01.400
MP5.

07:14:01.400 --> 07:14:04.400
Very classic, normally shown in movies.

07:14:04.400 --> 07:14:05.400
MP5K.

07:14:05.400 --> 07:14:06.400
Brian!

07:14:06.400 --> 07:14:08.400
I have returned from the job strongy.

07:14:08.400 --> 07:14:10.400
Hope it's going well.

07:14:10.400 --> 07:14:15.400
We're currently doing a boss battle and I'm getting absolutely wrecked, tiny, spiny.

07:14:15.400 --> 07:14:18.400
But...

07:14:18.400 --> 07:14:21.400
I can only do as much as I can.

07:14:21.400 --> 07:14:22.400
It's taken a while.

07:14:22.400 --> 07:14:23.400
I don't know.

07:14:23.400 --> 07:14:26.400
I feel like maybe there's something I should know.

07:14:26.400 --> 07:14:29.400
Like, maybe I should be in a mech at this point.

07:14:29.400 --> 07:14:31.400
It's very plausible.

07:14:31.400 --> 07:14:33.400
But thank you for the ship.

07:14:33.400 --> 07:14:36.400
We're getting there.

07:14:36.400 --> 07:14:38.400
He's just cast protection, so I don't even wanna...

07:14:38.400 --> 07:14:42.400
Like, I don't wanna waste the ammo since I've only got two left.

07:14:42.400 --> 07:14:46.400
Like, stop with the prayer protection.

07:14:46.400 --> 07:14:47.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:14:47.400 --> 07:14:48.400
Okay, I'm out of that.

07:14:48.400 --> 07:14:50.400
So next is Flamethrower.

07:14:50.400 --> 07:14:53.400
Nah, he gets so close when I do Flamethrower.

07:14:53.400 --> 07:14:55.400
Like, so close.

07:14:55.400 --> 07:14:59.400
Has he got Fury on so he does double damage to me?

07:14:59.400 --> 07:15:01.400
I think so.

07:15:01.400 --> 07:15:03.400
I think that's what that was.

07:15:03.400 --> 07:15:05.400
Right, we're just gonna have to do this.

07:15:05.400 --> 07:15:08.400
It seems he staggers with the assault, right?

07:15:12.400 --> 07:15:15.400
I think he's got a light machine gun, actually.

07:15:19.400 --> 07:15:22.400
He's getting low, so if he doesn't heal,

07:15:22.400 --> 07:15:24.400
then I think we're in...

07:15:24.400 --> 07:15:27.400
I think we're cooking by gas if he doesn't heal.

07:15:27.400 --> 07:15:31.400
Oh, okay, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it.

07:15:32.400 --> 07:15:37.400
I cast Mystic Barrier, honestly.

07:15:37.400 --> 07:15:41.400
Getting wrecked isn't needing to use ult and hasn't poked the damage,

07:15:41.400 --> 07:15:44.400
but someone either, honestly.

07:15:44.400 --> 07:15:49.400
First try, like, I'm just glad I'm not dying and getting stun locked.

07:15:49.400 --> 07:15:52.400
Where or why am I here?

07:15:54.400 --> 07:15:57.400
Why?

07:15:57.400 --> 07:16:00.400
What am I to do?

07:16:00.400 --> 07:16:03.400
Oh wait, I'm to do the song.

07:16:03.400 --> 07:16:06.400
I'm to do the song, I understand, my apologies.

07:16:06.400 --> 07:16:08.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:16:08.400 --> 07:16:11.400
You need to relax

07:16:11.400 --> 07:16:14.400
and take your little acrobatic self away.

07:16:14.400 --> 07:16:16.400
I need to do the song right now, where is it?

07:16:16.400 --> 07:16:20.400
Right, one, and then do a triangle.

07:16:20.400 --> 07:16:22.400
Somewhere here?

07:16:22.400 --> 07:16:23.400
No?

07:16:23.400 --> 07:16:24.400
Somewhere over here?

07:16:24.400 --> 07:16:26.400
Somewhere in the water?

07:16:27.400 --> 07:16:30.400
Okay, okay, triangle, triangle.

07:16:36.400 --> 07:16:38.400
Triangle?

07:16:42.400 --> 07:16:43.400
Oh, you don't attack.

07:16:43.400 --> 07:16:47.400
Whoa, they are humongous if you're a baby.

07:16:48.400 --> 07:16:49.400
Wait, where?

07:16:49.400 --> 07:16:51.400
Triangle?

07:16:52.400 --> 07:16:55.400
Well, that would be a triangle, maybe here.

07:16:55.400 --> 07:16:57.400
Okay, okay.

07:16:57.400 --> 07:16:59.400
Not a perfect triangle.

07:16:59.400 --> 07:17:01.400
We're about there cages.

07:17:01.400 --> 07:17:03.400
Staggered to death, honestly.

07:17:03.400 --> 07:17:05.400
Humongous wall.

07:17:05.400 --> 07:17:07.400
Strongly doesn't.

07:17:07.400 --> 07:17:10.400
For democracy, wait, wrong thing.

07:17:10.400 --> 07:17:13.400
What did you guys think of Helldivers?

07:17:13.400 --> 07:17:18.400
I got a chance to play it and I was like,

07:17:18.400 --> 07:17:21.400
hmm, I wonder if one of those things,

07:17:21.400 --> 07:17:23.400
like if you have good company and then it's a fun game,

07:17:23.400 --> 07:17:27.400
but who goes there, identify yourself?

07:17:27.400 --> 07:17:30.400
Whoa, get me out of here, because I just heard that.

07:17:30.400 --> 07:17:33.400
We're just doing this.

07:17:33.400 --> 07:17:36.400
I only played one, need friends for it.

07:17:36.400 --> 07:17:38.400
It was good until Sony.

07:17:38.400 --> 07:17:40.400
Oh, yeah, wait, actually, holy crap,

07:17:40.400 --> 07:17:44.400
we like completely missed out on all the war hammer.

07:17:44.400 --> 07:17:48.400
Okay, all the friggin...

07:17:51.400 --> 07:17:54.400
All right, well, and then all the kills in.

07:17:54.400 --> 07:17:56.400
Can I die in a cutscene?

07:17:56.400 --> 07:17:57.400
You did it.

07:17:57.400 --> 07:17:59.400
You did it.

07:17:59.400 --> 07:18:02.400
Oh, right, last song, question mark.

07:18:04.400 --> 07:18:07.400
I would like to return to Hell's Gate, please.

07:18:07.400 --> 07:18:09.400
Thank you very much.

07:18:09.400 --> 07:18:12.400
Oh, sorry, my little feces are moving my feet.

07:18:12.400 --> 07:18:15.400
My hands are very sweaty, but my feet are very dry right now,

07:18:15.400 --> 07:18:18.400
and I don't know if that means I'm dehydrated.

07:18:22.400 --> 07:18:24.400
I won't have a mention of your pop-up.

07:18:24.400 --> 07:18:25.400
Sorry, I misnamed it.

07:18:25.400 --> 07:18:30.400
I meant Helldivers, Sam.

07:18:30.400 --> 07:18:35.400
The Helldivers, like, it was like people were...

07:18:35.400 --> 07:18:38.400
They tried to make it so you had to have a PSN account or something,

07:18:38.400 --> 07:18:40.400
just to play the game.

07:18:40.400 --> 07:18:43.400
Even though they advertised, like,

07:18:43.400 --> 07:18:47.400
you can still play your game even without the PSN part.

07:18:48.400 --> 07:18:51.400
When in doubt, drink.

07:18:54.400 --> 07:18:56.400
Okay, is this...?

07:18:58.400 --> 07:19:01.400
Okay, this is the third song.

07:19:07.400 --> 07:19:09.400
Monkos.

07:19:11.400 --> 07:19:12.400
Oh!

07:19:15.400 --> 07:19:16.400
Jesus.

07:19:16.400 --> 07:19:18.400
That's so, um...

07:19:18.400 --> 07:19:20.400
He's so stinky.

07:19:20.400 --> 07:19:22.400
Level up.

07:19:23.400 --> 07:19:25.400
Yeah, they tried to force PSN accounts to play,

07:19:25.400 --> 07:19:28.400
which would have locked a lot of people out.

07:19:28.400 --> 07:19:31.400
And they're known for getting, uh, leaks, you know.

07:19:31.400 --> 07:19:32.400
Yeah.

07:19:37.400 --> 07:19:39.400
Deep Rock Galactic.

07:19:39.400 --> 07:19:41.400
They made a Lord of the Rings version.

07:19:41.400 --> 07:19:43.400
I think they called it Mines of Moria.

07:19:43.400 --> 07:19:46.400
I've not played it, but I hope it's multiplayer

07:19:46.400 --> 07:19:48.400
and I can, like, play with you guys.

07:19:48.400 --> 07:19:50.400
It'd be so fun.

07:20:01.400 --> 07:20:03.400
Speaking of which, you should check with him

07:20:03.400 --> 07:20:05.400
for your next mission.

07:20:05.400 --> 07:20:07.400
Oh, no.

07:20:07.400 --> 07:20:09.400
Oh, no.

07:20:13.400 --> 07:20:14.400
Huh?

07:20:16.400 --> 07:20:18.400
Oh, I'm having an avatar fight with him.

07:20:22.400 --> 07:20:24.400
Jarhead.

07:20:26.400 --> 07:20:29.400
I'll prove to you that I'm a real trooper.

07:20:29.400 --> 07:20:32.400
I'll eat crayons and smile about it.

07:20:34.400 --> 07:20:36.400
Deep Rock is crazy fun.

07:20:36.400 --> 07:20:38.400
We're it!

07:20:38.400 --> 07:20:41.400
We are going to the Hanging Gardens.

07:20:43.400 --> 07:20:45.400
This guy's very ergo.

07:20:45.400 --> 07:20:47.400
Part of the Jarhead clan.

07:20:47.400 --> 07:20:49.400
Oh, that's right! In the movies!

07:20:49.400 --> 07:20:51.400
These are part of the Jarhead clan.

07:20:52.400 --> 07:20:54.400
Movie quote spotted.

07:20:59.400 --> 07:21:00.400
Mushroom.

07:21:01.400 --> 07:21:03.400
Rock and Stone.

07:21:05.400 --> 07:21:06.400
Hello!

07:21:10.400 --> 07:21:11.400
We already...

07:21:11.400 --> 07:21:12.400
Let's hit the envelope.

07:21:12.400 --> 07:21:14.400
I've never heard that before.

07:21:14.400 --> 07:21:16.400
Let's hit the envelope.

07:21:16.400 --> 07:21:18.400
The Hanging Gardens.

07:21:22.400 --> 07:21:24.400
Did I hear Rock and Stone?

07:21:24.400 --> 07:21:25.400
You did.

07:21:26.400 --> 07:21:28.400
Do you think I can convince the girls

07:21:28.400 --> 07:21:30.400
to remain Zamorio with me?

07:21:35.400 --> 07:21:37.400
Triple Cannibal?

07:21:49.400 --> 07:21:51.400
Oh, dear.

07:21:53.400 --> 07:21:55.400
Uh, hello?

07:21:59.400 --> 07:22:01.400
We've just landed?

07:22:05.400 --> 07:22:06.400
Can I reload?

07:22:07.400 --> 07:22:08.400
I'm already out of money.

07:22:08.400 --> 07:22:09.400
Eh, money.

07:22:09.400 --> 07:22:10.400
I'm munitions.

07:22:11.400 --> 07:22:12.400
Did I not...

07:22:12.400 --> 07:22:14.400
Did the game automatically reload it for me?

07:22:17.400 --> 07:22:20.400
I want rid of these bow and arrow guys first.

07:22:23.400 --> 07:22:25.400
I only have three revives.

07:22:25.400 --> 07:22:26.400
I need to keep pick it.

07:22:26.400 --> 07:22:27.400
Wow!

07:22:27.400 --> 07:22:32.400
This is why I want rid of these bow and arrows.

07:22:37.400 --> 07:22:38.400
Oh, goodness me.

07:22:38.400 --> 07:22:40.400
Can I get a breathing space?

07:22:42.400 --> 07:22:44.400
Oh, this is crazy.

07:22:45.400 --> 07:22:46.400
Give me some space.

07:22:46.400 --> 07:22:48.400
Give me some space, please.

07:22:51.400 --> 07:22:53.400
Oh, space, space, space.

07:22:54.400 --> 07:22:56.400
They just keep coming.

07:22:57.400 --> 07:22:59.400
Oh, I'm getting spanked about.

07:22:59.400 --> 07:23:00.400
Oh, wrong button.

07:23:00.400 --> 07:23:02.400
Actually, no, protection's fine.

07:23:06.400 --> 07:23:08.400
They keep going around.

07:23:12.400 --> 07:23:15.400
Stop with the bow and arrow.

07:23:17.400 --> 07:23:20.400
Oh, this is so unpredictable where they move.

07:23:23.400 --> 07:23:25.400
Alright, I need to kill one more,

07:23:25.400 --> 07:23:27.400
and then I think they stop respawning.

07:23:27.400 --> 07:23:28.400
So this is...

07:23:29.400 --> 07:23:32.400
I'm just getting stun logged.

07:23:32.400 --> 07:23:33.400
I wish I had that.

07:23:33.400 --> 07:23:36.400
Is that what my belly did when I was a Navi?

07:23:37.400 --> 07:23:38.400
Oh, my gosh.

07:23:39.400 --> 07:23:40.400
What a rough landing.

07:23:40.400 --> 07:23:41.400
Oh, yeah.

07:23:41.400 --> 07:23:42.400
What does it say?

07:23:42.400 --> 07:23:44.400
Oh, it's a Haiti landing.

07:23:44.400 --> 07:23:45.400
Why?

07:23:45.400 --> 07:23:46.400
Why is it Haiti?

07:23:46.400 --> 07:23:47.400
Why Haiti?

07:23:47.400 --> 07:23:48.400
It's not Haiti.

07:23:50.400 --> 07:23:52.400
It was a miss input, miss input.

07:23:53.400 --> 07:23:54.400
That was chaos.

07:23:54.400 --> 07:23:56.400
That just dropped me right in there.

07:24:06.400 --> 07:24:07.400
Batista.

07:24:10.400 --> 07:24:11.400
Destroyed the Navi.

07:24:13.400 --> 07:24:15.400
Haiti, as opposed to smooth.

07:24:15.400 --> 07:24:16.400
Oh!

07:24:17.400 --> 07:24:19.400
Now that you have said that out loud,

07:24:19.400 --> 07:24:22.400
that makes so much more sense.

07:24:23.400 --> 07:24:26.400
I always wondered why the heck they always mentioned that.

07:24:26.400 --> 07:24:27.400
Oh, that was Harry.

07:24:27.400 --> 07:24:28.400
That was Harry.

07:24:28.400 --> 07:24:29.400
Harry.

07:24:29.400 --> 07:24:30.400
Harry.

07:24:30.400 --> 07:24:32.400
And I'm like, and I'm missing something.

07:24:32.400 --> 07:24:34.400
Clearly, brain cells, the whole thing.

07:24:34.400 --> 07:24:36.400
Alright, how do I get to this location?

07:24:38.400 --> 07:24:41.400
Take the skinny path behind me.

07:24:41.400 --> 07:24:43.400
I need to do a big old 1A.

07:24:45.400 --> 07:24:48.400
Why is the camera angle so bad in this game?

07:24:50.400 --> 07:24:51.400
Wait.

07:24:51.400 --> 07:24:52.400
Oh, no.

07:24:52.400 --> 07:24:54.400
Yeah, we're not doing that in the buggy.

07:24:54.400 --> 07:24:56.400
Please let me out.

07:24:57.400 --> 07:24:59.400
We will do this by foot.

07:25:01.400 --> 07:25:03.400
Is this where the flamethrower comes in?

07:25:03.400 --> 07:25:05.400
Can I even get close enough?

07:25:05.400 --> 07:25:06.400
Oh, I can.

07:25:11.400 --> 07:25:12.400
Okay.

07:25:12.400 --> 07:25:15.400
Flamethrower for the wildlife.

07:25:15.400 --> 07:25:16.400
For the plants.

07:25:18.400 --> 07:25:19.400
That's fine by me.

07:25:19.400 --> 07:25:21.400
I will try to remember this.

07:25:23.400 --> 07:25:25.400
If I make it across here,

07:25:25.400 --> 07:25:27.400
the dogs will go everywhere until...

07:25:27.400 --> 07:25:28.400
Get right.

07:25:28.400 --> 07:25:30.400
Wait, am I going the right way?

07:25:30.400 --> 07:25:32.400
Yeah, just keep going and then go to the right.

07:25:32.400 --> 07:25:33.400
Okay.

07:25:35.400 --> 07:25:36.400
Brilliant driving.

07:25:36.400 --> 07:25:37.400
Look, I'm...

07:25:37.400 --> 07:25:40.400
Thank goodness I don't actually have a driver's license

07:25:40.400 --> 07:25:42.400
because I'm not going to lie.

07:25:42.400 --> 07:25:45.400
It would not go down well.

07:25:45.400 --> 07:25:46.400
I can hear trombone.

07:25:48.400 --> 07:25:50.400
You're so rich.

07:25:53.400 --> 07:25:55.400
Oh, there's quite a lot of you.

07:25:55.400 --> 07:25:58.400
As long as I can jump past you, it's fine.

07:25:58.400 --> 07:25:59.400
I'll let you live.

07:25:59.400 --> 07:26:01.400
You know, I'm doing...

07:26:01.400 --> 07:26:02.400
I'm doing a while.

07:26:02.400 --> 07:26:05.400
We favor not killing you all, actually.

07:26:05.400 --> 07:26:06.400
So you should be...

07:26:06.400 --> 07:26:07.400
You should be grateful.

07:26:07.400 --> 07:26:09.400
You should be thankful.

07:26:09.400 --> 07:26:12.400
I said you should be grateful

07:26:12.400 --> 07:26:15.400
and you should be thankful.

07:26:15.400 --> 07:26:17.400
What the heck is this?

07:26:17.400 --> 07:26:18.400
I don't know.

07:26:19.400 --> 07:26:20.400
A repulsor?

07:26:22.400 --> 07:26:23.400
A zone repulse.

07:26:23.400 --> 07:26:25.400
Oh, that's right.

07:26:25.400 --> 07:26:26.400
Please.

07:26:26.400 --> 07:26:27.400
No, no.

07:26:27.400 --> 07:26:28.400
Please just let me do it so you guys leave.

07:26:28.400 --> 07:26:29.400
Oh, okay.

07:26:29.400 --> 07:26:30.400
They're safe.

07:26:30.400 --> 07:26:32.400
Nah, I've seen worse drivers.

07:26:32.400 --> 07:26:33.400
I can't believe it.

07:26:33.400 --> 07:26:36.400
I can't believe I contributed to the stereotype.

07:26:36.400 --> 07:26:39.400
Wait, is this grunt here to help us or...

07:26:43.400 --> 07:26:46.400
No, he's here to give us our next job.

07:26:49.400 --> 07:26:50.400
Booyah.

07:26:52.400 --> 07:26:54.400
Don't worry, we're almost there.

07:27:02.400 --> 07:27:03.400
DT.

07:27:09.400 --> 07:27:10.400
DT.

07:27:10.400 --> 07:27:11.400
Sure.

07:27:11.400 --> 07:27:12.400
DT.

07:27:14.400 --> 07:27:16.400
Oh, that makes broken.

07:27:16.400 --> 07:27:17.400
I was gonna go in there.

07:27:19.400 --> 07:27:21.400
If I go straight ahead,

07:27:21.400 --> 07:27:22.400
should be fine.

07:27:22.400 --> 07:27:23.400
Let's go.

07:27:23.400 --> 07:27:24.400
Why not?

07:27:25.400 --> 07:27:27.400
Wait, straight ahead.

07:27:27.400 --> 07:27:28.400
Yeah, straight ahead.

07:27:30.400 --> 07:27:32.400
Okay, let's...

07:27:32.400 --> 07:27:34.400
Don't flip the buggy.

07:27:34.400 --> 07:27:36.400
It's my only request.

07:27:37.400 --> 07:27:38.400
It's killing...

07:27:44.400 --> 07:27:46.400
Why would you do that?

07:27:46.400 --> 07:27:48.400
You knew exactly what you were doing?

07:27:51.400 --> 07:27:52.400
I can't get up.

07:27:54.400 --> 07:27:57.400
I can't get up and everything's gonna attack me.

07:27:57.400 --> 07:27:58.400
Literally, look on the map.

07:27:58.400 --> 07:28:01.400
There's like a freaking massive ass battle bone.

07:28:01.400 --> 07:28:02.400
It's over.

07:28:02.400 --> 07:28:04.400
This is over for me.

07:28:05.400 --> 07:28:06.400
Yeah.

07:28:06.400 --> 07:28:08.400
Oh my gosh.

07:28:08.400 --> 07:28:11.400
Oh my gosh.

07:28:11.400 --> 07:28:13.400
Oh my gosh, Golly.

07:28:14.400 --> 07:28:16.400
Oh gosh, Golly G.

07:28:17.400 --> 07:28:20.400
That really was not supposed to happen.

07:28:20.400 --> 07:28:23.400
The Dave, who have created this map,

07:28:23.400 --> 07:28:25.400
knew exactly what he was doing.

07:28:25.400 --> 07:28:27.400
Giving me a heart attack.

07:28:28.400 --> 07:28:30.400
They're still here.

07:28:30.400 --> 07:28:33.400
They're literally waiting to attack me.

07:28:35.400 --> 07:28:37.400
I'm trying, I'm trying.

07:28:43.400 --> 07:28:45.400
It's getting a bit non-smooth.

07:28:45.400 --> 07:28:46.400
It's getting a bit heady, lads.

07:28:46.400 --> 07:28:47.400
It's getting a bit heady.

07:28:47.400 --> 07:28:49.400
Okay, we're friends, it's fine.

07:28:49.400 --> 07:28:51.400
Friends.

07:28:57.400 --> 07:29:00.400
Actually, there's no way you're a super stash.

07:29:00.400 --> 07:29:03.400
You'll play the game by just dodging everything all the time.

07:29:03.400 --> 07:29:06.400
But this is the best I can do under the turquoise.

07:29:08.400 --> 07:29:10.400
Can I get this package, please?

07:29:10.400 --> 07:29:11.400
Thank you.

07:29:12.400 --> 07:29:13.400
Objective complete.

07:29:13.400 --> 07:29:15.400
Let's get the heck out of here.

07:29:15.400 --> 07:29:16.400
Jeez.

07:29:17.400 --> 07:29:18.400
Where'd I need?

07:29:19.400 --> 07:29:23.400
Brett, can you stop sending me one side of the map to the other?

07:29:23.400 --> 07:29:24.400
I don't...

07:29:25.400 --> 07:29:28.400
This game is having an awfully fun time doing that.

07:29:28.400 --> 07:29:29.400
How...

07:29:29.400 --> 07:29:30.400
I can't even teleport there.

07:29:30.400 --> 07:29:33.400
There's not even anything to teleport from.

07:29:35.400 --> 07:29:39.400
If I take a right and don't fall off, man...

07:29:40.400 --> 07:29:41.400
You fell off.

07:29:42.400 --> 07:29:44.400
Oh, let's go, let's go, let's go.

07:29:45.400 --> 07:29:51.400
Just ignore me, I'm not part of the field.

07:29:51.400 --> 07:29:52.400
I'm actually...

07:29:52.400 --> 07:29:54.400
Oh, I'm just a field medic.

07:29:55.400 --> 07:29:56.400
What is it?

07:29:56.400 --> 07:29:59.400
That British Red Cross rule or something?

07:30:00.400 --> 07:30:02.400
I can't get over.

07:30:02.400 --> 07:30:04.400
I have to go to a low.

07:30:05.400 --> 07:30:07.400
I don't want to take any fall damage.

07:30:07.400 --> 07:30:10.400
I'm literally two centimeters off the ground, so...

07:30:11.400 --> 07:30:13.400
Oh, we have to take the long way around.

07:30:14.400 --> 07:30:16.400
Through all those navi!

07:30:16.400 --> 07:30:18.400
And they're literally right there.

07:30:18.400 --> 07:30:20.400
And they're already attacking me.

07:30:21.400 --> 07:30:23.400
Oh, the navi.

07:30:23.400 --> 07:30:24.400
And attacking me.

07:30:24.400 --> 07:30:26.400
Name a better duo.

07:30:26.400 --> 07:30:28.400
Do I go that way?

07:30:29.400 --> 07:30:31.400
Yes, I can go that way.

07:30:32.400 --> 07:30:36.400
I literally went invisible as that guy struck me.

07:30:37.400 --> 07:30:40.400
No white crosses for health packs and games and stuff.

07:30:40.400 --> 07:30:42.400
Apparently that's a war crime.

07:30:42.400 --> 07:30:44.400
Also, shooting unarmed medics.

07:30:44.400 --> 07:30:47.400
Exactly, like seriously, what's going on here?

07:30:48.400 --> 07:30:49.400
You cannae jump it?

07:30:49.400 --> 07:30:51.400
No, I cannae jump it.

07:30:51.400 --> 07:30:53.400
Right, I'm sure these are bombs.

07:30:53.400 --> 07:30:56.400
Yeah, okay, I was gonna say, I'm sure there's something up with those.

07:30:56.400 --> 07:30:59.400
I had to find out for myself, I'd find out the hard way.

07:31:02.400 --> 07:31:04.400
Oh, there's so many of them.

07:31:07.400 --> 07:31:10.400
Okay, you don't even respond to that.

07:31:12.400 --> 07:31:16.400
Oh, let me guess, they don't hurt the level, so it's gonna be too easy.

07:31:18.400 --> 07:31:19.400
Oh!

07:31:19.400 --> 07:31:20.400
Oh, no, no, no.

07:31:20.400 --> 07:31:21.400
There's no human here.

07:31:21.400 --> 07:31:22.400
I'm actually a...

07:31:22.400 --> 07:31:24.400
I'm a mouse.

07:31:24.400 --> 07:31:25.400
I'm a mammal.

07:31:25.400 --> 07:31:28.400
No, wait, navi aren't considered mammals, are they?

07:31:28.400 --> 07:31:29.400
I'm actually a...

07:31:29.400 --> 07:31:31.400
I feel like I'm going the wrong way.

07:31:31.400 --> 07:31:33.400
I feel like I'm going the wrong way.

07:31:34.400 --> 07:31:37.400
Technically, if I just keep going forward, it's fine.

07:31:37.400 --> 07:31:40.400
I just jive right into them.

07:31:40.400 --> 07:31:41.400
I'm not real.

07:31:41.400 --> 07:31:44.400
I'm actually gonna claim this pod first, and then go in with...

07:31:44.400 --> 07:31:47.400
I'm probably gonna get shot in the bum with an arrow though.

07:31:47.400 --> 07:31:48.400
Oh.

07:31:48.400 --> 07:31:50.400
Oh, and there's another one right there.

07:31:50.400 --> 07:31:52.400
Har har har, very funny game.

07:31:53.400 --> 07:31:54.400
No human here, only a co-

07:31:54.400 --> 07:31:59.400
Literally, I'm just an innocent little sef full of pod doing my thing, you know?

07:31:59.400 --> 07:32:00.400
Hey, no good time.

07:32:01.400 --> 07:32:04.400
Just need to try and speedrun getting out of all these

07:32:04.400 --> 07:32:07.400
absolutely atrociously dangerous areas,

07:32:07.400 --> 07:32:10.400
and then we can finally destroy Pandora,

07:32:10.400 --> 07:32:13.400
and live happily ever after.

07:32:14.400 --> 07:32:15.400
Wait.

07:32:15.400 --> 07:32:16.400
Oh.

07:32:16.400 --> 07:32:17.400
Wait.

07:32:20.400 --> 07:32:22.400
Oh, no, you do that much better.

07:32:23.400 --> 07:32:25.400
Wait, this is a dead end?

07:32:26.400 --> 07:32:27.400
Can you stop?

07:32:27.400 --> 07:32:30.400
Please, I'm literally stuck here with you.

07:32:30.400 --> 07:32:31.400
Is this a dead end?

07:32:31.400 --> 07:32:32.400
Yes or no?

07:32:33.400 --> 07:32:36.400
Have I just gone a horrifically wrong way?

07:32:38.400 --> 07:32:40.400
Why would you do that?

07:32:40.400 --> 07:32:45.400
Okay, I need to now take the biggest frickin' circle over.

07:32:48.400 --> 07:32:50.400
Hi everyone, I'm back.

07:32:50.400 --> 07:32:52.400
Thank you for joining again.

07:32:52.400 --> 07:32:54.400
We are still the RD, we're still the bad guys,

07:32:54.400 --> 07:32:58.400
and we're still avoiding every fight possible under the sun

07:32:58.400 --> 07:33:02.400
because this is just impossible, there's no way.

07:33:03.400 --> 07:33:06.400
I refuse to believe this is even plausible.

07:33:07.400 --> 07:33:09.400
Humans number one, baby.

07:33:09.400 --> 07:33:10.400
Innocent.

07:33:10.400 --> 07:33:12.400
Innocent, no.

07:33:13.400 --> 07:33:14.400
Innocent.

07:33:14.400 --> 07:33:16.400
I'm an innocent cuttlefish.

07:33:16.400 --> 07:33:19.400
Hold on a minute, I don't know if you've seen them or anything.

07:33:19.400 --> 07:33:21.400
I'm an innocent cuttlefish.

07:33:22.400 --> 07:33:23.400
Oh, that scared me.

07:33:24.400 --> 07:33:26.400
I actually need to heal.

07:33:26.400 --> 07:33:31.400
I need to heal, but I want to stop because I think I'm going to get my bum bitten.

07:33:34.400 --> 07:33:41.400
Oh my god, the paralysis from those flies are so punishing.

07:33:42.400 --> 07:33:43.400
So punishing.

07:33:43.400 --> 07:33:46.400
I'm going to see if I can run past both of these, but...

07:33:47.400 --> 07:33:51.400
Oh, poison, poison, poison.

07:33:52.400 --> 07:33:53.400
Hello?

07:33:55.400 --> 07:33:57.400
Am I walled off again?

07:33:58.400 --> 07:34:00.400
What have I done to me?

07:34:00.400 --> 07:34:01.400
Why?

07:34:03.400 --> 07:34:05.400
What have I done to deserve this?

07:34:06.400 --> 07:34:07.400
Why?

07:34:07.400 --> 07:34:10.400
I'm so confused why I can't access this area.

07:34:10.400 --> 07:34:12.400
I literally need to go down.

07:34:17.400 --> 07:34:20.400
Okay, that dog can't come on me.

07:34:22.400 --> 07:34:23.400
On the branch.

07:34:23.400 --> 07:34:25.400
Oh, can I climb down this?

07:34:25.400 --> 07:34:26.400
Or is this Navi only?

07:34:26.400 --> 07:34:27.400
No, it can't be Navi only.

07:34:27.400 --> 07:34:28.400
I'm human.

07:34:28.400 --> 07:34:30.400
I can't freaking do it.

07:34:32.400 --> 07:34:38.400
Bro, I'm going to explore the whole map before I actually get to my location.

07:34:40.400 --> 07:34:41.400
I can't believe...

07:34:42.400 --> 07:34:43.400
Bro...

07:34:46.400 --> 07:34:47.400
Explore the whole map.

07:34:47.400 --> 07:34:49.400
I mean, drowning people might have been a thing.

07:34:49.400 --> 07:34:51.400
I've not done it yet.

07:34:51.400 --> 07:34:54.400
I'm not even successful in doing my first hypnosis stream.

07:34:55.400 --> 07:34:56.400
This is...

07:34:56.400 --> 07:35:00.400
I'm getting absolutely spun about in this game.

07:35:00.400 --> 07:35:01.400
You know that?

07:35:02.400 --> 07:35:05.400
I'm about to discover an outpost.

07:35:05.400 --> 07:35:08.400
I don't know what's going to happen when I get to it, but...

07:35:09.400 --> 07:35:14.400
I'll literally discover the whole map before I unlock the next objective.

07:35:17.400 --> 07:35:18.400
Oh, goodness me.

07:35:18.400 --> 07:35:21.400
Everything's abandoned and there's the name on it.

07:35:21.400 --> 07:35:23.400
I've freaking saved me.

07:35:24.400 --> 07:35:26.400
So if I go down here...

07:35:32.400 --> 07:35:34.400
It's still the wrong place.

07:35:34.400 --> 07:35:35.400
I need to drop below.

07:35:35.400 --> 07:35:37.400
Can I drop below in the upcoming thing?

07:35:39.400 --> 07:35:40.400
Oh!

07:35:43.400 --> 07:35:44.400
Did I miss that?

07:35:46.400 --> 07:35:48.400
Please don't put me all the way back.

07:35:48.400 --> 07:35:50.400
I have been travelling...

07:35:50.400 --> 07:35:51.400
for day and...

07:35:51.400 --> 07:35:52.400
Why would you just...

07:35:52.400 --> 07:35:53.400
upon me?

07:35:54.400 --> 07:35:56.400
I need to...

07:35:58.400 --> 07:36:02.400
I need to gently go down on the map.

07:36:03.400 --> 07:36:05.400
Gently go down on the map.

07:36:06.400 --> 07:36:09.400
Getting the buggy, we're driving.

07:36:09.400 --> 07:36:13.400
Because this is taking far too long to unlock the next objective.

07:36:13.400 --> 07:36:17.400
I don't know how I perished from that, but whatever.

07:36:17.400 --> 07:36:19.400
Right, so that's a crossing.

07:36:19.400 --> 07:36:20.400
Right, so...

07:36:20.400 --> 07:36:21.400
Oh!

07:36:27.400 --> 07:36:28.400
Oh!

07:36:35.400 --> 07:36:36.400
Okay.

07:36:36.400 --> 07:36:37.400
Okay.

07:36:37.400 --> 07:36:39.400
Okay, there's a really...

07:36:39.400 --> 07:36:40.400
I'm getting trolled.

07:36:40.400 --> 07:36:42.400
I'm getting trolled.

07:36:43.400 --> 07:36:44.400
Where am I?

07:36:44.400 --> 07:36:45.400
How...

07:36:48.400 --> 07:36:51.400
I need to go backwards, like this way?

07:36:51.400 --> 07:36:53.400
No, like this way?

07:36:54.400 --> 07:36:56.400
Go back and do a U-turn.

07:36:56.400 --> 07:36:58.400
Right, I need to do a U-turn.

07:36:59.400 --> 07:37:03.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:37:03.400 --> 07:37:04.400
I need...

07:37:04.400 --> 07:37:07.400
I figured out how I get there, I think.

07:37:08.400 --> 07:37:09.400
Oh my goodness.

07:37:10.400 --> 07:37:11.400
That was a fun noise.

07:37:11.400 --> 07:37:15.400
That was just the noise of pure shock and horror.

07:37:15.400 --> 07:37:16.400
Oh, and I'm about to hit a Navi tri-

07:37:16.400 --> 07:37:18.400
Of course I am, because why would I?

07:37:18.400 --> 07:37:20.400
Why wouldn't I hit a massive Navi tri-

07:37:20.400 --> 07:37:21.400
straight ahead?

07:37:22.400 --> 07:37:24.400
And I'm about to uncluck right in front of them all.

07:37:24.400 --> 07:37:27.400
Hi guys, do you just want to totally annihilate me one by one?

07:37:27.400 --> 07:37:31.400
You might as well line up and have a little Congo going, you know?

07:37:33.400 --> 07:37:37.400
Just to really drive at home how much I am dead meat in this game.

07:37:38.400 --> 07:37:40.400
I like how, actually, I just...

07:37:40.400 --> 07:37:43.400
I will say one thing, I like how I'm always, like, congratulated, like,

07:37:43.400 --> 07:37:45.400
from how much I'm achieving,

07:37:45.400 --> 07:37:47.400
but the reality of the situation is,

07:37:47.400 --> 07:37:50.400
I am just, like, cheesing all the way through the battles.

07:37:50.400 --> 07:37:54.400
I'm, like, literally not injuring any Navi whatsoever.

07:37:54.400 --> 07:37:57.400
And they're like, wow, you're doing amazing out there on the battlefield.

07:37:57.400 --> 07:38:00.400
And the reality, like, I'm just doing backflips all the time

07:38:00.400 --> 07:38:02.400
and getting away from the enemy.

07:38:03.400 --> 07:38:07.400
We finally got there, and yeah, that took so long.

07:38:07.400 --> 07:38:09.400
Take us out to dinner first.

07:38:11.400 --> 07:38:13.400
Mm-hmm.

07:38:15.400 --> 07:38:17.400
This can happen to you.

07:38:17.400 --> 07:38:19.400
You love nature.

07:38:19.400 --> 07:38:21.400
That's what I get for loving nature.

07:38:21.400 --> 07:38:22.400
That took...

07:38:22.400 --> 07:38:23.400
Wait.

07:38:25.400 --> 07:38:27.400
This teleport site was already on...

07:38:32.400 --> 07:38:33.400
Mm.

07:38:34.400 --> 07:38:35.400
Mm.

07:38:36.400 --> 07:38:37.400
Mm-hmm.

07:38:37.400 --> 07:38:38.400
Mm.

07:38:39.400 --> 07:38:40.400
Mm-hmm.

07:38:40.400 --> 07:38:41.400
Success.

07:38:41.400 --> 07:38:42.400
I got it.

07:38:42.400 --> 07:38:44.400
It was already unlocked.

07:38:44.400 --> 07:38:45.400
It's fine.

07:38:45.400 --> 07:38:46.400
It's fine. I'm fine.

07:38:46.400 --> 07:38:48.400
Fine, that took me how long?

07:38:48.400 --> 07:38:49.400
Together.

07:38:49.400 --> 07:38:50.400
Please.

07:38:50.400 --> 07:38:52.400
Try not to blow yourself up.

07:38:52.400 --> 07:38:54.400
I passed the first one, honestly.

07:38:54.400 --> 07:38:56.400
Right, what am I doing?

07:38:57.400 --> 07:38:59.400
I can't believe that.

07:38:59.400 --> 07:39:01.400
Ten thing.

07:39:02.400 --> 07:39:04.400
Did they both blow up, or what?

07:39:04.400 --> 07:39:06.400
Or just the one?

07:39:07.400 --> 07:39:09.400
What am I blowing up?

07:39:09.400 --> 07:39:10.400
Something, anyway.

07:39:10.400 --> 07:39:12.400
Oh, I'm blowing up the freaking rocks

07:39:12.400 --> 07:39:14.400
that blocked me from moving in the first place.

07:39:14.400 --> 07:39:16.400
Hardy, hardy, hard, very funny.

07:39:16.400 --> 07:39:18.400
Already freaking...

07:39:18.400 --> 07:39:19.400
Ooh!

07:39:19.400 --> 07:39:21.400
That's not supposed to happen.

07:39:21.400 --> 07:39:22.400
What was it?

07:39:25.400 --> 07:39:27.400
What am I getting shot by?

07:39:27.400 --> 07:39:29.400
What's going on, guys?

07:39:29.400 --> 07:39:31.400
Oh, this game's trolling me.

07:39:33.400 --> 07:39:35.400
It seems like we've got company.

07:39:36.400 --> 07:39:38.400
I don't like the samples.

07:39:38.400 --> 07:39:40.400
Too many Viper Wars.

07:39:40.400 --> 07:39:42.400
There's got to be some way to slow them down.

07:39:42.400 --> 07:39:43.400
I'm on it.

07:39:43.400 --> 07:39:45.400
There's got to be some way to slow them down.

07:39:47.400 --> 07:39:49.400
Okay, we got a new unlock.

07:39:49.400 --> 07:39:50.400
We're almost there.

07:39:50.400 --> 07:39:51.400
Hold on.

07:39:51.400 --> 07:39:52.400
Hold on for me.

07:39:52.400 --> 07:39:53.400
You're so close.

07:39:53.400 --> 07:39:55.400
Right, I've got healing four.

07:39:55.400 --> 07:39:57.400
That's what I like to see.

07:39:57.400 --> 07:40:00.400
Let us put down these.

07:40:03.400 --> 07:40:05.400
Oh, is that a bomb?

07:40:05.400 --> 07:40:07.400
That has to be a bomb.

07:40:07.400 --> 07:40:08.400
Then it might be.

07:40:08.400 --> 07:40:10.400
That's supposed to be a bomb, yeah.

07:40:12.400 --> 07:40:13.400
Oh, right.

07:40:13.400 --> 07:40:16.400
The bomb did activate even though I did it at the same time.

07:40:20.400 --> 07:40:22.400
Okay, just to do it one more time.

07:40:22.400 --> 07:40:24.400
One more time.

07:40:28.400 --> 07:40:29.400
It's okay.

07:40:29.400 --> 07:40:30.400
It's okay.

07:40:30.400 --> 07:40:32.400
Right, they're both...

07:40:33.400 --> 07:40:35.400
I'm getting slowed down by the...

07:40:38.400 --> 07:40:39.400
Enough, enough, enough.

07:40:39.400 --> 07:40:40.400
I'm getting slowed down.

07:40:45.400 --> 07:40:46.400
That's all right.

07:40:46.400 --> 07:40:48.400
You just want to spend more time.

07:40:48.400 --> 07:40:49.400
Yeah, see how you're doing.

07:40:49.400 --> 07:40:50.400
You have to say you're out,

07:40:50.400 --> 07:40:52.400
but you know, you just have to do a lot.

07:40:52.400 --> 07:40:54.400
You keep running through the dang thing.

07:40:57.400 --> 07:40:59.400
Well, how about that?

07:41:00.400 --> 07:41:02.400
Half as dear as older than I am.

07:41:03.400 --> 07:41:05.400
Hydration check.

07:41:11.400 --> 07:41:13.400
Windsor's orders to fill the power cell in the system.

07:41:13.400 --> 07:41:15.400
Reactivate the thing.

07:41:16.400 --> 07:41:17.400
Okay.

07:41:17.400 --> 07:41:19.400
I'm analyzing the map

07:41:19.400 --> 07:41:22.400
so I can basically go whatever way I want.

07:41:22.400 --> 07:41:25.400
I just got the sweep since I was looking at it.

07:41:25.400 --> 07:41:27.400
Dog was getting shot in the background.

07:41:27.400 --> 07:41:29.400
Literally, the pervy thing.

07:41:30.400 --> 07:41:32.400
It's not their fault they spawned on time, bro.

07:41:36.400 --> 07:41:37.400
Me.

07:41:37.400 --> 07:41:38.400
Oh, it's such a shame.

07:41:38.400 --> 07:41:39.400
The pervy dogs.

07:41:39.400 --> 07:41:40.400
Also me.

07:41:40.400 --> 07:41:41.400
The dogs won't leave me alone.

07:41:42.400 --> 07:41:43.400
I've had enough.

07:41:44.400 --> 07:41:45.400
No.

07:41:45.400 --> 07:41:46.400
That's too many.

07:41:46.400 --> 07:41:47.400
No, that's one too many.

07:41:47.400 --> 07:41:48.400
So, that's actually one too many.

07:41:48.400 --> 07:41:50.400
That's three too many.

07:41:50.400 --> 07:41:52.400
If any more come at me,

07:41:52.400 --> 07:41:53.400
I'm out to be raging.

07:41:54.400 --> 07:41:55.400
This is too much.

07:41:55.400 --> 07:41:57.400
How are you supposed to genuinely do this?

07:41:57.400 --> 07:41:59.400
Does the devs expect you to pause

07:41:59.400 --> 07:42:01.400
and do this every single time?

07:42:01.400 --> 07:42:03.400
There's no way.

07:42:03.400 --> 07:42:06.400
I'm getting bit to death, though.

07:42:07.400 --> 07:42:09.400
There's no way in heck.

07:42:09.400 --> 07:42:10.400
I refuse.

07:42:10.400 --> 07:42:12.400
I refuse.

07:42:13.400 --> 07:42:16.400
Then we're going to get spat on by the flies

07:42:16.400 --> 07:42:18.400
and then there's mere dogs.

07:42:21.400 --> 07:42:22.400
Okay.

07:42:22.400 --> 07:42:24.400
I somehow am making it.

07:42:24.400 --> 07:42:26.400
Do I need to take a little to the...

07:42:26.400 --> 07:42:28.400
Okay, I need to drop the buggy

07:42:28.400 --> 07:42:30.400
when I get ahead here.

07:42:31.400 --> 07:42:34.400
And then I'll have gone through the section pretty quickly.

07:42:41.400 --> 07:42:42.400
There.

07:42:42.400 --> 07:42:44.400
Okay, we're all good again.

07:42:44.400 --> 07:42:46.400
That is a pretty plan, honestly.

07:42:48.400 --> 07:42:49.400
I'm surprised.

07:42:52.400 --> 07:42:53.400
Wow.

07:42:54.400 --> 07:42:56.400
Okay, there's allies ahead.

07:42:56.400 --> 07:42:58.400
That's all I like to see.

07:43:01.400 --> 07:43:03.400
Mate, you're just letting that plan

07:43:03.400 --> 07:43:06.400
absolutely decimate you for no reason.

07:43:09.400 --> 07:43:11.400
Okay, this is like so much easier.

07:43:12.400 --> 07:43:13.400
Can you actually burn the plants?

07:43:13.400 --> 07:43:14.400
You know that?

07:43:14.400 --> 07:43:15.400
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

07:43:15.400 --> 07:43:16.400
It's too many.

07:43:16.400 --> 07:43:17.400
Too many dogs.

07:43:21.400 --> 07:43:23.400
Why are there so many multi-different colors?

07:43:24.400 --> 07:43:26.400
But when you play, like, the Navi side,

07:43:26.400 --> 07:43:31.400
where you're supposed to, like, be appreciating nature and stuff,

07:43:31.400 --> 07:43:33.400
it's just like, you know...

07:43:34.400 --> 07:43:36.400
Oh, for goodness' sake, what am I doing now?

07:43:37.400 --> 07:43:39.400
If I have the backtrack one more time.

07:43:41.400 --> 07:43:43.400
Right, thankfully I can teleport here.

07:43:44.400 --> 07:43:46.400
You make me backtrack one more time game.

07:43:46.400 --> 07:43:48.400
I'm going to have it out for you.

07:43:48.400 --> 07:43:49.400
I might not self-clear.

07:43:54.400 --> 07:43:55.400
Hmm.

07:44:04.400 --> 07:44:08.400
We surely must be getting backtops soon with this one.

07:44:09.400 --> 07:44:13.400
I feel like we grabbed all the songs, so what now?

07:44:17.400 --> 07:44:19.400
So we're to get in Harper Deeds.

07:44:24.400 --> 07:44:26.400
Um, the Navi side of the game is good.

07:44:26.400 --> 07:44:28.400
The RDA side...

07:44:29.400 --> 07:44:31.400
I'm just wanting it to be over with.

07:44:31.400 --> 07:44:33.400
It's too hard.

07:44:33.400 --> 07:44:35.400
Like, I'm genuinely hard.

07:44:35.400 --> 07:44:36.400
No, I'm not hard.

07:44:36.400 --> 07:44:37.400
Sorry.

07:44:37.400 --> 07:44:40.400
The game is genuinely hard on the RDA side.

07:44:46.400 --> 07:44:49.400
Okay, so Kendra's gotten doubts of what the thing is.

07:44:49.400 --> 07:44:50.400
Nothing yet.

07:44:50.400 --> 07:44:51.400
Let's keep focused.

07:44:51.400 --> 07:44:52.400
You need to grab those shards.

07:44:52.400 --> 07:44:54.400
Report back when you're...

07:44:55.400 --> 07:44:57.400
And I don't mean that, I don't mean that.

07:44:59.400 --> 07:45:04.400
So when we get the offer...

07:45:06.400 --> 07:45:08.400
Why is it sending me...

07:45:08.400 --> 07:45:11.400
This map is a nightmare to navigate.

07:45:12.400 --> 07:45:14.400
I'm not being funny.

07:45:15.400 --> 07:45:17.400
This is probably one of the hardest maps.

07:45:18.400 --> 07:45:21.400
No, this will be the hardest map ever.

07:45:23.400 --> 07:45:26.400
That I've had to navigate and do all this stuff in.

07:45:26.400 --> 07:45:27.400
I don't even know where to start.

07:45:27.400 --> 07:45:29.400
Maybe the one to my left?

07:45:30.400 --> 07:45:32.400
If I take a left and then before...

07:45:33.400 --> 07:45:34.400
No.

07:45:34.400 --> 07:45:36.400
If I take a left and then take a right...

07:45:38.400 --> 07:45:40.400
This is the filter for the human campaign.

07:45:40.400 --> 07:45:42.400
Literally, like...

07:45:43.400 --> 07:45:45.400
It's getting rough.

07:45:46.400 --> 07:45:48.400
It's getting rough being told to go.

07:45:48.400 --> 07:45:53.400
And I know they provide transport via the mechs and the...

07:45:54.400 --> 07:45:55.400
Buggies and that.

07:45:55.400 --> 07:46:01.400
But if you're going to do it that your buggy health makes you explode and you have to reload...

07:46:01.400 --> 07:46:04.400
There's no point in providing that kind of thing.

07:46:04.400 --> 07:46:05.400
Like it's just...

07:46:05.400 --> 07:46:06.400
The name was going to be...

07:46:06.400 --> 07:46:07.400
Wait, if I go...

07:46:11.400 --> 07:46:12.400
Okay, I can resurrect it.

07:46:12.400 --> 07:46:13.400
I need to take the first right though.

07:46:13.400 --> 07:46:14.400
I can resurrect it.

07:46:14.400 --> 07:46:15.400
It's fine.

07:46:18.400 --> 07:46:20.400
Oh, please don't.

07:46:20.400 --> 07:46:22.400
I'm going to run out of hiding.

07:46:26.400 --> 07:46:29.400
I am running for my life.

07:46:29.400 --> 07:46:32.400
I didn't even know they were going to do Thanos in the middle.

07:46:32.400 --> 07:46:33.400
No, no.

07:46:34.400 --> 07:46:35.400
Please leave me alone.

07:46:35.400 --> 07:46:39.400
Please, I ask kindly and respectfully to respect my space.

07:46:40.400 --> 07:46:45.400
I very kindly ask you to respect my social distance.

07:46:45.400 --> 07:46:47.400
Social distance and keys?

07:46:47.400 --> 07:46:51.400
I don't know if you've seen that Scottish meme where the guy goes social distance, please.

07:46:53.400 --> 07:46:55.400
But he said it so politely.

07:46:57.400 --> 07:46:59.400
I'm just hauling ass.

07:46:59.400 --> 07:47:01.400
There's no way I'd make this without...

07:47:02.400 --> 07:47:03.400
Oh, right.

07:47:03.400 --> 07:47:04.400
Where is it?

07:47:04.400 --> 07:47:05.400
It's up here, to be honest.

07:47:07.400 --> 07:47:08.400
Okay.

07:47:08.400 --> 07:47:09.400
Oh, this is actually...

07:47:09.400 --> 07:47:11.400
Okay, I'll give the game Devs something.

07:47:11.400 --> 07:47:12.400
This is actually kind of cool.

07:47:12.400 --> 07:47:14.400
I like the classic like spiral up something.

07:47:15.400 --> 07:47:16.400
I'll see it.

07:47:16.400 --> 07:47:17.400
I'll see it.

07:47:17.400 --> 07:47:18.400
Whoa.

07:47:19.400 --> 07:47:20.400
Lovely!

07:47:20.400 --> 07:47:21.400
Lovely.

07:47:21.400 --> 07:47:22.400
Thank you, Devs.

07:47:22.400 --> 07:47:26.400
Thank you, Devs, for putting a crack in the fricked rock stairwell.

07:47:26.400 --> 07:47:29.400
I'll take everything I said back about this design.

07:47:30.400 --> 07:47:32.400
Take it all back.

07:47:33.400 --> 07:47:37.400
Random gap in the stairwell whilst you're getting whacked by Navi

07:47:37.400 --> 07:47:41.400
and the dogs are biting your ankles at the bottom of the rock face.

07:47:41.400 --> 07:47:42.400
And things are exploding.

07:47:42.400 --> 07:47:46.400
There's like an exploding plant that's aiming on me right now.

07:47:46.400 --> 07:47:47.400
That's what that...

07:47:48.400 --> 07:47:53.400
Oh, oh, speaking of exploding plants, here's the bomb himself.

07:47:53.400 --> 07:47:55.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:47:55.400 --> 07:47:56.400
Okay, right.

07:47:58.400 --> 07:48:05.400
I am now going to use that teleport to go back to that wiggly one up there.

07:48:07.400 --> 07:48:08.400
No!

07:48:19.400 --> 07:48:22.400
I've losing the will to live.

07:48:22.400 --> 07:48:24.400
Just get me out of here.

07:48:24.400 --> 07:48:25.400
Right.

07:48:26.400 --> 07:48:31.400
If I go here and I take a right, I definitely have access to whatever that right one is.

07:48:32.400 --> 07:48:33.400
Wasted.

07:48:33.400 --> 07:48:34.400
Surely saved.

07:48:34.400 --> 07:48:35.400
Yes, thank God.

07:48:35.400 --> 07:48:36.400
Mission failed.

07:48:36.400 --> 07:48:37.400
I'll get him next time.

07:48:39.400 --> 07:48:43.400
Just spawn me on whatever you want.

07:48:43.400 --> 07:48:44.400
It's fine.

07:48:44.400 --> 07:48:45.400
I need to take a right?

07:48:45.400 --> 07:48:46.400
Like this way?

07:48:46.400 --> 07:48:48.400
Yeah, go that way.

07:48:48.400 --> 07:48:50.400
And get her gone.

07:48:54.400 --> 07:48:56.400
Is this the last NDA?

07:48:56.400 --> 07:48:57.400
NDA.

07:48:58.400 --> 07:49:01.400
I just saw that in the corner of my eye.

07:49:04.400 --> 07:49:05.400
No.

07:49:06.400 --> 07:49:09.400
You can AI lock to something else because it ain't me, buddy.

07:49:09.400 --> 07:49:11.400
It ain't me that you're AI locking to.

07:49:12.400 --> 07:49:13.400
Get out of here.

07:49:13.400 --> 07:49:14.400
Get out of here with that.

07:49:14.400 --> 07:49:16.400
I'm no even entertaining.

07:49:16.400 --> 07:49:19.400
I am taking so much fall damage just to...

07:49:19.400 --> 07:49:21.400
Wait, I've already been here before.

07:49:21.400 --> 07:49:23.400
I just need to go left now.

07:49:24.400 --> 07:49:28.400
I might actually have to pop, heal, and...

07:49:29.400 --> 07:49:31.400
Yeah, okay, lovely.

07:49:31.400 --> 07:49:32.400
Can you...

07:49:32.400 --> 07:49:33.400
Yeah, do that.

07:49:33.400 --> 07:49:35.400
Yeah, and then get the heck out of here.

07:49:37.400 --> 07:49:40.400
Oh, my gosh, golly.

07:49:40.400 --> 07:49:42.400
This is just running similar.

07:49:42.400 --> 07:49:44.400
I'm literally Tracer from Overwatch.

07:49:44.400 --> 07:49:46.400
Maybe I'll be Tracer.

07:49:46.400 --> 07:49:47.400
Should've been Widowmaker.

07:49:47.400 --> 07:49:48.400
What about Widowmaker?

07:49:48.400 --> 07:49:49.400
What about Bastion?

07:49:49.400 --> 07:49:50.400
They're Bastion.

07:49:50.400 --> 07:49:51.400
You're a race of Winston.

07:49:51.400 --> 07:49:53.400
I will not be Winston.

07:49:54.400 --> 07:49:55.400
How about Genji?

07:49:55.400 --> 07:49:57.400
I'm already Genji.

07:49:57.400 --> 07:49:58.400
What about McCree?

07:49:58.400 --> 07:49:59.400
I already chose McCree.

07:49:59.400 --> 07:50:00.400
Right.

07:50:00.400 --> 07:50:02.400
What's your idea?

07:50:02.400 --> 07:50:04.400
Should've been...

07:50:04.400 --> 07:50:06.400
Any other...

07:50:06.400 --> 07:50:10.400
Right, if I come back the way I came from,

07:50:10.400 --> 07:50:13.400
I can hit whatever that big sector is.

07:50:14.400 --> 07:50:17.400
I assume this has to be the last mission.

07:50:17.400 --> 07:50:20.400
Like, this is for map design...

07:50:22.400 --> 07:50:23.400
For map...

07:50:23.400 --> 07:50:25.400
Maybe not right now,

07:50:25.400 --> 07:50:27.400
whilst all the navi are on my butthole.

07:50:27.400 --> 07:50:29.400
That'd be great not to get some luck.

07:50:30.400 --> 07:50:31.400
Um...

07:50:32.400 --> 07:50:34.400
Oh, just make me Invis.

07:50:34.400 --> 07:50:36.400
Should I pick Mercy?

07:50:36.400 --> 07:50:38.400
Okay, watch your stream.

07:50:38.400 --> 07:50:41.400
Mercy up in one hour ten.

07:50:41.400 --> 07:50:43.400
I repeat, Mercy up in one hour ten.

07:50:43.400 --> 07:50:47.400
I believe everyone is offline for the day,

07:50:47.400 --> 07:50:51.400
but Mercy is online in one hour ten.

07:50:51.400 --> 07:50:55.400
And of course, my Invis is gonna run out right on this guy.

07:50:55.400 --> 07:50:58.400
Have I got straight ahead, actually?

07:50:58.400 --> 07:50:59.400
I don't know what to do.

07:50:59.400 --> 07:51:01.400
I'm getting so close to him.

07:51:01.400 --> 07:51:03.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:51:03.400 --> 07:51:05.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:51:05.400 --> 07:51:07.400
We knew, we knew.

07:51:07.400 --> 07:51:11.400
We knew there's no point in being pretending.

07:51:12.400 --> 07:51:13.400
Azura is still playing one shot.

07:51:13.400 --> 07:51:15.400
Oh, Azura is still on map.

07:51:15.400 --> 07:51:17.400
Apologies, Azura is currently playing one shot

07:51:17.400 --> 07:51:19.400
if you are interested in that.

07:51:19.400 --> 07:51:20.400
If you are...

07:51:20.400 --> 07:51:22.400
Buy Azura, buy Azura, buy Azura!

07:51:22.400 --> 07:51:24.400
She's playing one shot.

07:51:24.400 --> 07:51:26.400
Which is not super hot,

07:51:26.400 --> 07:51:29.400
which I actually thought it was super hot.

07:51:29.400 --> 07:51:32.400
I am currently sharing tree branches.

07:51:34.400 --> 07:51:35.400
I don't know what to do

07:51:35.400 --> 07:51:37.400
because I'm gonna get knocked off,

07:51:37.400 --> 07:51:39.400
which is not what I want at all.

07:51:39.400 --> 07:51:41.400
So I'm actually gonna have to fight.

07:51:41.400 --> 07:51:42.400
I can't believe it.

07:51:42.400 --> 07:51:44.400
I'm actually gonna have to fight for one.

07:51:44.400 --> 07:51:45.400
Yeah, sorry.

07:51:45.400 --> 07:51:47.400
We cannot be sharing tree branches.

07:51:47.400 --> 07:51:52.400
These trees are too skinny for me to not perish.

07:51:53.400 --> 07:51:54.400
Buy Azura, buy Azura.

07:51:54.400 --> 07:51:56.400
What is getting me now?

07:51:56.400 --> 07:51:58.400
Oh my God, it's a boss.

07:51:58.400 --> 07:52:00.400
This is a boss ring?

07:52:00.400 --> 07:52:03.400
This, this is a boss ring.

07:52:03.400 --> 07:52:05.400
You have got to be kidding me.

07:52:07.400 --> 07:52:08.400
I don't...

07:52:08.400 --> 07:52:12.400
This is exactly what I didn't want to happen.

07:52:12.400 --> 07:52:15.400
I'm sorry, but he's gonna have to come down here

07:52:15.400 --> 07:52:17.400
and fight me like a man.

07:52:17.400 --> 07:52:21.400
I can clear all these guys at least.

07:52:23.400 --> 07:52:25.400
Ooh, I'm not gonna enjoy this fight.

07:52:25.400 --> 07:52:27.400
I can tell you that much.

07:52:27.400 --> 07:52:30.400
Yeah, I need to clear out all the other little guys first.

07:52:30.400 --> 07:52:32.400
Well, little, I'm little,

07:52:32.400 --> 07:52:35.400
but there's literally nothing I can do

07:52:35.400 --> 07:52:38.400
until all of these guys are gone.

07:52:40.400 --> 07:52:42.400
I'm just, I'm just...

07:52:45.400 --> 07:52:46.400
Relax.

07:52:46.400 --> 07:52:48.400
I am literally, they are going invisible

07:52:48.400 --> 07:52:51.400
so I can't see anything.

07:52:53.400 --> 07:52:54.400
Okay, back off.

07:52:54.400 --> 07:52:55.400
Seriously, back off.

07:52:55.400 --> 07:52:57.400
This isn't funny anymore.

07:52:57.400 --> 07:52:58.400
I'm no laughing.

07:52:58.400 --> 07:52:59.400
I'm no getting sniped.

07:52:59.400 --> 07:53:00.400
I'm no getting sniped.

07:53:00.400 --> 07:53:02.400
Well, the quest...

07:53:02.400 --> 07:53:03.400
No.

07:53:05.400 --> 07:53:07.400
Rob, Rob, you're gonna have to give me a chance.

07:53:07.400 --> 07:53:10.400
AI, AI, you're gonna have to give me a chance

07:53:10.400 --> 07:53:12.400
to clear these guys out.

07:53:12.400 --> 07:53:14.400
And now the dogs are joining in.

07:53:14.400 --> 07:53:16.400
It's fine.

07:53:16.400 --> 07:53:18.400
It's fine.

07:53:18.400 --> 07:53:20.400
Everyone just freaking unanimously...

07:53:20.400 --> 07:53:21.400
Gang...

07:53:21.400 --> 07:53:22.400
No, I can't say that word.

07:53:22.400 --> 07:53:24.400
What do you know what I mean?

07:53:25.400 --> 07:53:26.400
This is game.

07:53:26.400 --> 07:53:28.400
Rob, Rob, Rob.

07:53:28.400 --> 07:53:29.400
What am I supposed to do?

07:53:29.400 --> 07:53:30.400
What am I supposed to do?

07:53:30.400 --> 07:53:31.400
Go and be real.

07:53:31.400 --> 07:53:32.400
Be real.

07:53:32.400 --> 07:53:33.400
Be real.

07:53:33.400 --> 07:53:34.400
Be hashtag real.

07:53:35.400 --> 07:53:37.400
These are gonna need gears to break.

07:53:37.400 --> 07:53:40.400
Gear break, gear break, gear break, gear break, gear break, gear break.

07:53:40.400 --> 07:53:42.400
Are you guys infinitely spawning?

07:53:42.400 --> 07:53:45.400
Or is this just getting really unlucky?

07:53:45.400 --> 07:53:48.400
Are they infinitely spawning or am I just...

07:53:48.400 --> 07:53:49.400
Oh, right, no.

07:53:49.400 --> 07:53:52.400
Let's get rid of the freaking flame sword

07:53:52.400 --> 07:53:55.400
because it's just absolutely nothing for us.

07:53:56.400 --> 07:53:58.400
A bush boss!

07:53:58.400 --> 07:54:00.400
Right, well, I'm sure whatever.

07:54:00.400 --> 07:54:01.400
Wait.

07:54:01.400 --> 07:54:03.400
Is everyone on go right now?

07:54:07.400 --> 07:54:09.400
I've killed his...

07:54:09.400 --> 07:54:10.400
thing.

07:54:11.400 --> 07:54:13.400
Oh, his navi's gone, so he's dead.

07:54:13.400 --> 07:54:16.400
Oh, his navi's gone, so he's a human now?

07:54:22.400 --> 07:54:23.400
Am I done?

07:54:23.400 --> 07:54:24.400
No!

07:54:24.400 --> 07:54:25.400
Oh!

07:54:29.400 --> 07:54:31.400
This has to be the last mission.

07:54:35.400 --> 07:54:37.400
Hold on, let me reload.

07:54:38.400 --> 07:54:39.400
What's going on here?

07:54:39.400 --> 07:54:40.400
Here.

07:54:40.400 --> 07:54:41.400
Wait, hold on, I need ammo.

07:54:42.400 --> 07:54:44.400
He, like, flew off.

07:54:44.400 --> 07:54:47.400
I'm sorry, but the full damage would have been enough.

07:54:47.400 --> 07:54:50.400
Oh, thank goodness, Gravy, he's perished.

07:54:50.400 --> 07:54:52.400
Don't ever come back again.

07:54:52.400 --> 07:54:54.400
You're not fun to deal with.

07:54:54.400 --> 07:54:56.400
Right, where'd any go?

07:54:56.400 --> 07:55:01.400
I'll go here, and then if I go southward, I'll get the next one.

07:55:01.400 --> 07:55:04.400
The anti-strongy coalition has been founded by the navi.

07:55:04.400 --> 07:55:05.400
Literally...

07:55:07.400 --> 07:55:09.400
Literally let me destroy nature and peace.

07:55:09.400 --> 07:55:11.400
I'll go this way?

07:55:12.400 --> 07:55:13.400
Yes.

07:55:13.400 --> 07:55:15.400
Let's get to it.

07:55:17.400 --> 07:55:19.400
Let's get to it.

07:55:19.400 --> 07:55:21.400
Everybody look for two.

07:55:25.400 --> 07:55:26.400
Oh, you weren't...

07:55:26.400 --> 07:55:27.400
Wait, what are they fighting?

07:55:27.400 --> 07:55:28.400
They're fighting each other.

07:55:28.400 --> 07:55:30.400
Right, go, no, no, go fight the navi.

07:55:30.400 --> 07:55:31.400
Then they border with me.

07:55:31.400 --> 07:55:33.400
You were fighting him a minute ago, all willy-nilly.

07:55:33.400 --> 07:55:35.400
Then you look at me all of a sudden.

07:55:35.400 --> 07:55:37.400
No, I haven't.

07:55:37.400 --> 07:55:39.400
What am I supposed to be doing here?

07:55:44.400 --> 07:55:45.400
Hold on.

07:55:45.400 --> 07:55:47.400
Put me up here so I can see.

07:55:47.400 --> 07:55:49.400
Oh, I'm supposed to go down.

07:55:51.400 --> 07:55:53.400
Oh, that's not nice.

07:55:53.400 --> 07:55:54.400
Who's doing that?

07:55:54.400 --> 07:55:55.400
What's that?

07:55:55.400 --> 07:55:56.400
Whoever's doing that, you stop that.

07:55:56.400 --> 07:55:58.400
I can see you shooting it, but I can't see you.

07:55:58.400 --> 07:55:59.400
Yeah, stop.

07:56:00.400 --> 07:56:02.400
Cease your activities.

07:56:03.400 --> 07:56:05.400
Cease your activities.

07:56:06.400 --> 07:56:08.400
That's ridiculous, the plant.

07:56:08.400 --> 07:56:11.400
Being able to freaking send off a bomb like that.

07:56:13.400 --> 07:56:15.400
Who wrote this game?

07:56:15.400 --> 07:56:17.400
I'd say I can write better, but that's not true.

07:56:18.400 --> 07:56:22.400
No, I have to go all the way around to get down there.

07:56:25.400 --> 07:56:28.400
There's no way to fall down there safely.

07:56:28.400 --> 07:56:32.400
Well, well, I need to do a big ol' U-turn.

07:56:32.400 --> 07:56:34.400
Do you hate the navi yet?

07:56:35.400 --> 07:56:39.400
No, I hate playing the RDA, say, to deal with the navi.

07:56:39.400 --> 07:56:42.400
I can see that much very strongly.

07:56:42.400 --> 07:56:45.400
But I don't understand how there's plants around here

07:56:45.400 --> 07:56:47.400
that the navi can claim,

07:56:47.400 --> 07:56:49.400
because it's not like I can utilize it.

07:56:54.400 --> 07:56:55.400
I'm just bombing everything.

07:56:55.400 --> 07:56:58.400
Actually, I probably just bomb myself, you know that.

07:56:58.400 --> 07:57:00.400
Unless I can get out here fast enough.

07:57:01.400 --> 07:57:04.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we need to do that.

07:57:05.400 --> 07:57:08.400
Okay, please tell me I did them all.

07:57:10.400 --> 07:57:12.400
I didn't do them all?

07:57:14.400 --> 07:57:16.400
Oh, it was to grab a crystal.

07:57:16.400 --> 07:57:18.400
My apologies, didn't realize.

07:57:19.400 --> 07:57:21.400
My apologies, my apologies.

07:57:21.400 --> 07:57:24.400
I suck, I suck, but it's okay.

07:57:24.400 --> 07:57:26.400
Please don't do that, please don't do that.

07:57:26.400 --> 07:57:28.400
Please don't corner me, because that's not really...

07:57:29.400 --> 07:57:31.400
Ooh, not good.

07:57:31.400 --> 07:57:33.400
I am in the rock, I am in the rock.

07:57:33.400 --> 07:57:35.400
I am in the rock, I am in the rock, I am in the rock, I am in the rock.

07:57:35.400 --> 07:57:38.400
Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out.

07:57:38.400 --> 07:57:39.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.

07:57:39.400 --> 07:57:41.400
You can throw me in that direction, throw me in that direction.

07:57:41.400 --> 07:57:44.400
Ractomy! Right, no, no, no, no, you're taking the piss.

07:57:44.400 --> 07:57:48.400
You're taking the piss, you're taking the piss, you're taking the piss.

07:57:49.400 --> 07:57:51.400
You don't need to do that.

07:57:51.400 --> 07:57:53.400
Please stop embodying on me.

07:57:53.400 --> 07:57:57.400
I'm trying to dodge the aim, but I don't have health unlock.

07:57:57.400 --> 07:57:58.400
I can heal now.

07:57:58.400 --> 07:58:00.400
I'm gonna go next.

07:58:00.400 --> 07:58:02.400
I can almost go in viz, I can almost go in viz.

07:58:02.400 --> 07:58:05.400
Hold on, where's the last thing that I need to go to?

07:58:07.400 --> 07:58:09.400
If I take...

07:58:11.400 --> 07:58:13.400
If I just go back to where I came from?

07:58:13.400 --> 07:58:15.400
That sounds...

07:58:15.400 --> 07:58:18.400
I mean, if I go back to that hotel, where did I get there though?

07:58:20.400 --> 07:58:22.400
I go forward and take a right?

07:58:24.400 --> 07:58:26.400
Surely.

07:58:26.400 --> 07:58:29.400
I'm a bit disoriented on this map.

07:58:29.400 --> 07:58:31.400
If I take a right on this log...

07:58:32.400 --> 07:58:36.400
If I get on that log, then I should be able to...

07:58:37.400 --> 07:58:38.400
Do you mind?

07:58:38.400 --> 07:58:41.400
Honestly, give me a jumpscare whenever he is over...

07:58:41.400 --> 07:58:43.400
Like, hanging about, honestly, I can't believe it.

07:58:43.400 --> 07:58:46.400
I can't believe that you're hanging about on your planet, honestly.

07:58:46.400 --> 07:58:48.400
It's just so good.

07:58:48.400 --> 07:58:51.400
They really wanted you to know that the RDA or the bad guys

07:58:51.400 --> 07:58:54.400
are literally so punishing to play the RDA side.

07:58:54.400 --> 07:58:56.400
Sorry, but like, Navi is so easy.

07:58:56.400 --> 07:59:00.400
I'm gonna send over critical, but I don't think the game is balanced well.

07:59:00.400 --> 07:59:04.400
It just seems like, unless I'm missing the gun

07:59:04.400 --> 07:59:07.400
that you're supposed to use in quotation marks,

07:59:07.400 --> 07:59:10.400
I am getting brutally...

07:59:10.400 --> 07:59:12.400
Oh no, I don't use the teleport.

07:59:12.400 --> 07:59:14.400
I do a 180.

07:59:14.400 --> 07:59:17.400
And I go this way, just to make triple sure.

07:59:17.400 --> 07:59:20.400
I do not want to take off in the wrong direction.

07:59:20.400 --> 07:59:22.400
It's punishing, but fun.

07:59:22.400 --> 07:59:26.400
If it's fun for you to watch me get punished, then sure.

07:59:26.400 --> 07:59:29.400
Punish me away, but this is...

07:59:30.400 --> 07:59:33.400
Raging just thinks I'm just doing so bad.

07:59:34.400 --> 07:59:37.400
I can hear the end again.

07:59:40.400 --> 07:59:43.400
They gave you a guard down for stealth, no run kills.

07:59:43.400 --> 07:59:45.400
Oh, honestly.

07:59:45.400 --> 07:59:47.400
Watch over here.

07:59:49.400 --> 07:59:51.400
I hope this is the area.

07:59:51.400 --> 07:59:54.400
I'm gonna cry if this is like a dead end up here.

07:59:55.400 --> 07:59:58.400
Both to play and watch you, honestly.

07:59:59.400 --> 08:00:03.400
I never understood streamers that can punish themselves over and over with the same game.

08:00:03.400 --> 08:00:05.400
I just don't...

08:00:05.400 --> 08:00:08.400
Wow, that's what I don't want.

08:00:08.400 --> 08:00:10.400
None of that.

08:00:10.400 --> 08:00:13.400
I swear if there's a dog behind me, stop it!

08:00:18.400 --> 08:00:20.400
Okay, that's him there.

08:00:20.400 --> 08:00:26.400
I'm really not interested in going down to get wrecked by all the other NPCs as well,

08:00:26.400 --> 08:00:28.400
but I don't think...

08:00:29.400 --> 08:00:33.400
I almost just forfeited all that progress right there.

08:00:35.400 --> 08:00:38.400
That's my shotgun, and you put that away so I can do rounds.

08:00:38.400 --> 08:00:40.400
Who are you?

08:00:43.400 --> 08:00:45.400
This is getting rough.

08:00:49.400 --> 08:00:52.400
Oh, come on, come on, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.

08:00:52.400 --> 08:00:57.400
You know you want to, you know you want to, you know you want to get that health bar to zero for me, baby.

08:00:58.400 --> 08:01:00.400
Oh no, fall down it.

08:01:02.400 --> 08:01:05.400
Right, I'm not going to go in the vines next time.

08:01:05.400 --> 08:01:07.400
He was honestly taking a hammer in.

08:01:07.400 --> 08:01:10.400
I feel sorry for making you play the RDA side.

08:01:10.400 --> 08:01:15.400
Okay, I've respawned in the area, which is good but bad because the NPCs are literally all...

08:01:15.400 --> 08:01:16.400
Okay, okay.

08:01:16.400 --> 08:01:19.400
We actually didn't lose the progress on the health bar.

08:01:19.400 --> 08:01:22.400
I don't think I've seen that before, but lol.

08:01:27.400 --> 08:01:28.400
Oof.

08:01:33.400 --> 08:01:37.400
Oh wow, just spawn all the NPCs together, I don't know.

08:01:38.400 --> 08:01:39.400
No, it's fine.

08:01:39.400 --> 08:01:41.400
I didn't want to live anyway.

08:01:43.400 --> 08:01:45.400
Alright, I won't be showing that to him.

08:01:46.400 --> 08:01:49.400
Oh, come on.

08:01:52.400 --> 08:01:55.400
Oh, let me reload, let me reload.

08:01:55.400 --> 08:01:57.400
And I can deal with you.

08:01:57.400 --> 08:02:01.400
Oh wow, I'm actually out of ammo, that's how much you've made me spawn that ship.

08:02:02.400 --> 08:02:03.400
No.

08:02:04.400 --> 08:02:06.400
Can you aim? Can you aim? Hello?

08:02:06.400 --> 08:02:09.400
Oh, for crying out loud.

08:02:12.400 --> 08:02:18.400
Can you aim at the freaking guy that is literally one millimeter from your eyeball?

08:02:19.400 --> 08:02:21.400
Yeah, you're getting...

08:02:22.400 --> 08:02:24.400
I thought I dealt with you.

08:02:26.400 --> 08:02:31.400
Don't even bother, Mike.

08:02:31.400 --> 08:02:33.400
Was he shooting the buggy?

08:02:33.400 --> 08:02:35.400
I think he was, honestly.

08:02:37.400 --> 08:02:40.400
Oh, this game is going to give me a heart attack.

08:02:41.400 --> 08:02:49.400
Right, I just need to make it back to this person and then I think I'm done with the worst map ever.

08:02:49.400 --> 08:02:56.400
This map belongs under my sweaty feet.

08:02:57.400 --> 08:03:02.400
Never to be allowed to breathe fresh, dry air again.

08:03:03.400 --> 08:03:04.400
That was awful.

08:03:05.400 --> 08:03:08.400
And I wish not to ever be subjected to this.

08:03:09.400 --> 08:03:11.400
Because, oh my gosh.

08:03:11.400 --> 08:03:15.400
I know there's buggies everywhere but I don't even want to get in them because they just explode in a millisecond.

08:03:16.400 --> 08:03:18.400
Goes to the trash.

08:03:18.400 --> 08:03:20.400
Ah, so it's a good map. No.

08:03:21.400 --> 08:03:24.400
It deserves nothing but my manky, sweaty grippers.

08:03:25.400 --> 08:03:26.400
Paramersweep.

08:03:28.400 --> 08:03:29.400
Oh my god.

08:03:29.400 --> 08:03:30.400
Don't...

08:03:31.400 --> 08:03:35.400
Don't give me another map like hanging gardens again.

08:03:35.400 --> 08:03:38.400
Hanging gardens? It makes me want to hang myself.

08:03:38.400 --> 08:03:40.400
Thank you. I'll be here all week.

08:03:40.400 --> 08:03:41.400
And...

08:03:46.400 --> 08:03:48.400
Oh, I've still not defeated Harper.

08:03:48.400 --> 08:03:49.400
Okay, I guess we'll go.

08:03:49.400 --> 08:03:51.400
Another map after this.

08:03:57.400 --> 08:03:58.400
Hi, officer.

08:04:07.400 --> 08:04:08.400
More.

08:04:08.400 --> 08:04:10.400
More. It's not over.

08:04:11.400 --> 08:04:13.400
Wait, say it again with the bidons.

08:04:13.400 --> 08:04:15.400
Wait, say what again? Tell me.

08:04:15.400 --> 08:04:17.400
Tell me I've already forgotten what I'm supposed to say.

08:04:17.400 --> 08:04:19.400
What did I say? I've already forgotten.

08:04:24.400 --> 08:04:25.400
What am I supposed to say?

08:04:26.400 --> 08:04:28.400
I'm ready. I'm ready for what I'm supposed to say.

08:04:30.400 --> 08:04:33.400
Oh, what's the map called? I've already forgotten.

08:04:33.400 --> 08:04:35.400
I just picked up a signal way out there.

08:04:35.400 --> 08:04:37.400
It's not much, but it's something.

08:04:37.400 --> 08:04:38.400
Alright.

08:04:38.400 --> 08:04:40.400
The map's called hanging gardens?

08:04:40.400 --> 08:04:42.400
More like I want to hang myself.

08:04:45.400 --> 08:04:47.400
Thank you. Thank you.

08:04:47.400 --> 08:04:49.400
Appreciate it. Appreciate it.

08:04:53.400 --> 08:04:54.400
Oh my god.

08:04:54.400 --> 08:04:56.400
I've still not done another fucking map.

08:04:56.400 --> 08:04:58.400
I just want to go there and...

08:04:58.400 --> 08:04:59.400
I actually have to go there.

08:04:59.400 --> 08:05:00.400
I actually have to go there.

08:05:00.400 --> 08:05:01.400
I've never seen someone say,

08:05:02.400 --> 08:05:04.400
Why are we still in the front?

08:05:04.400 --> 08:05:05.400
Relatable.

08:05:05.400 --> 08:05:07.400
We'll be here all week.

08:05:07.400 --> 08:05:09.400
We'll be here all week on this freaking one map.

08:05:09.400 --> 08:05:11.400
On this one map.

08:05:11.400 --> 08:05:14.400
They really did not want anyone to have fun on the RDS.

08:05:14.400 --> 08:05:15.400
Like literally.

08:05:19.400 --> 08:05:22.400
I want to say this is the Harper fight.

08:05:22.400 --> 08:05:24.400
And then I think that's it.

08:05:24.400 --> 08:05:25.400
No.

08:05:26.400 --> 08:05:27.400
No.

08:05:27.400 --> 08:05:29.400
I'm not even scared anymore.

08:05:29.400 --> 08:05:30.400
I am annoyed.

08:05:31.400 --> 08:05:33.400
If I take a right,

08:05:34.400 --> 08:05:35.400
then

08:05:35.400 --> 08:05:38.400
either way I'm going to make it to the location.

08:05:39.400 --> 08:05:41.400
Some people enjoy suffering,

08:05:41.400 --> 08:05:42.400
myself included.

08:05:42.400 --> 08:05:44.400
But do you enjoy watching suffering?

08:05:44.400 --> 08:05:45.400
Like,

08:05:45.400 --> 08:05:48.400
I actually don't mind watching like a binding of Isaac runs.

08:05:48.400 --> 08:05:51.400
And if the person like struggles to get through it,

08:05:51.400 --> 08:05:52.400
but still wins,

08:05:52.400 --> 08:05:53.400
like I don't mind watching.

08:05:53.400 --> 08:05:55.400
Like I find it quite entertaining.

08:05:56.400 --> 08:05:57.400
Alright.

08:05:57.400 --> 08:05:59.400
If I take the vines across.

08:05:59.400 --> 08:06:00.400
Yeah.

08:06:00.400 --> 08:06:01.400
Oh, and there you are.

08:06:01.400 --> 08:06:02.400
Thank you.

08:06:03.400 --> 08:06:04.400
Yeah.

08:06:04.400 --> 08:06:05.400
Yeah.

08:06:05.400 --> 08:06:06.400
Yeah.

08:06:06.400 --> 08:06:07.400
Please don't do that.

08:06:07.400 --> 08:06:08.400
Oh, wait.

08:06:08.400 --> 08:06:10.400
No, they're going to push me off the freaking vines.

08:06:10.400 --> 08:06:11.400
If I go up.

08:06:11.400 --> 08:06:12.400
Stop.

08:06:12.400 --> 08:06:13.400
Stop spanking me.

08:06:13.400 --> 08:06:16.400
It's Emmy who has that audio this month.

08:06:16.400 --> 08:06:17.400
Okay.

08:06:17.400 --> 08:06:18.400
Not me.

08:06:18.400 --> 08:06:20.400
I do not have that kind of audio this month.

08:06:22.400 --> 08:06:23.400
I need to go down.

08:06:24.400 --> 08:06:26.400
No, I better not need to go down.

08:06:26.400 --> 08:06:27.400
Some of them they are.

08:06:30.400 --> 08:06:31.400
What?

08:06:31.400 --> 08:06:32.400
I need...

08:06:32.400 --> 08:06:33.400
Well,

08:06:33.400 --> 08:06:36.400
I'm a bit scared to go on this in all honesty.

08:06:38.400 --> 08:06:39.400
Oh.

08:06:43.400 --> 08:06:44.400
Right.

08:06:44.400 --> 08:06:45.400
A boss fight with Harper.

08:06:58.400 --> 08:06:59.400
Got it.

08:07:01.400 --> 08:07:03.400
What kind of audio do we have this month?

08:07:04.400 --> 08:07:06.400
I have sent train in one.

08:07:07.400 --> 08:07:10.400
I'm trying to remember the other two off the top of my hand.

08:07:11.400 --> 08:07:13.400
I should kind of recall.

08:07:13.400 --> 08:07:15.400
One of them is part of my 1.4.

08:07:16.400 --> 08:07:20.400
I have two four-parter series and part one comes out.

08:07:24.400 --> 08:07:27.400
I almost just did what you think I almost just did.

08:07:28.400 --> 08:07:31.400
I almost fell off the map doing that man over there.

08:07:31.400 --> 08:07:33.400
That was very scary.

08:07:35.400 --> 08:07:37.400
Yeah, rather not you should have changed yourself to suffering.

08:07:38.400 --> 08:07:41.400
Oh, that just cancelled my invisibility.

08:07:41.400 --> 08:07:42.400
Okay.

08:07:42.400 --> 08:07:43.400
That's fine.

08:07:43.400 --> 08:07:44.400
No, I totally didn't need that.

08:07:44.400 --> 08:07:47.400
It's not like the cooldown time is like a whole 60 seconds or something.

08:07:48.400 --> 08:07:49.400
Oh.

08:07:53.400 --> 08:07:54.400
Oh.

08:07:58.400 --> 08:07:59.400
Yes.

08:07:59.400 --> 08:08:00.400
Thank you.

08:08:00.400 --> 08:08:01.400
Please.

08:08:01.400 --> 08:08:02.400
Oh, shoot them.

08:08:02.400 --> 08:08:03.400
I can't be bothered anymore.

08:08:04.400 --> 08:08:05.400
After this,

08:08:05.400 --> 08:08:06.400
I don't really like...

08:08:07.400 --> 08:08:08.400
Oh, after things,

08:08:08.400 --> 08:08:10.400
I don't really like when you have that time.

08:08:13.400 --> 08:08:14.400
Seals women the year.

08:08:16.400 --> 08:08:17.400
If this human is just miserable,

08:08:17.400 --> 08:08:18.400
the whole time is in this one.

08:08:19.400 --> 08:08:20.400
It's not too bad.

08:08:20.400 --> 08:08:21.400
Like honestly,

08:08:21.400 --> 08:08:23.400
I'm actually enjoying to see what the RDA said is,

08:08:23.400 --> 08:08:26.400
but this map

08:08:26.400 --> 08:08:28.400
size is

08:08:29.400 --> 08:08:30.400
mercenary.

08:08:30.400 --> 08:08:31.400
Oh, new outfit.

08:08:31.400 --> 08:08:32.400
All right.

08:08:32.400 --> 08:08:33.400
All right.

08:08:33.400 --> 08:08:34.400
Girl moment.

08:08:34.400 --> 08:08:35.400
Let's see what we look like.

08:08:35.400 --> 08:08:36.400
Wait.

08:08:37.400 --> 08:08:38.400
Oh, right.

08:08:38.400 --> 08:08:39.400
No.

08:08:39.400 --> 08:08:41.400
So this is Max.

08:08:43.400 --> 08:08:45.400
Max protection.

08:08:45.400 --> 08:08:47.400
Well, I'll take Max protection.

08:08:48.400 --> 08:08:50.400
And now we need to go

08:08:52.400 --> 08:08:53.400
this way.

08:08:54.400 --> 08:08:55.400
What's that?

08:08:56.400 --> 08:08:57.400
I'm to take one of these.

08:09:00.400 --> 08:09:01.400
Shoot.

08:09:02.400 --> 08:09:03.400
How do I shoot?

08:09:03.400 --> 08:09:04.400
I've already fun.

08:09:04.400 --> 08:09:05.400
Um, no.

08:09:06.400 --> 08:09:07.400
Oh, A.G.

08:09:07.400 --> 08:09:08.400
Louise.

08:09:08.400 --> 08:09:09.400
Let's do that one.

08:09:12.400 --> 08:09:13.400
What's over here?

08:09:14.400 --> 08:09:15.400
Oh.

08:09:19.400 --> 08:09:20.400
Oh.

08:09:21.400 --> 08:09:22.400
Lost Cathedral?

08:09:22.400 --> 08:09:23.400
Cathedral?

08:09:25.400 --> 08:09:28.400
It kind of reminds me of the underground cave

08:09:29.400 --> 08:09:30.400
in Skyrim.

08:09:32.400 --> 08:09:34.400
Why is the music even scarier?

08:09:35.400 --> 08:09:36.400
Oh, please be a small map.

08:09:37.400 --> 08:09:38.400
Oh, it's a small map.

08:09:38.400 --> 08:09:39.400
Thank y'all.

08:09:42.400 --> 08:09:43.400
Thank you.

08:09:43.400 --> 08:09:44.400
I fit small.

08:09:46.400 --> 08:09:47.400
What just got me?

08:09:47.400 --> 08:09:48.400
Who?

08:09:49.400 --> 08:09:50.400
Are they above me?

08:09:50.400 --> 08:09:52.400
It must be the Navi above me.

08:09:55.400 --> 08:09:56.400
Okay, the Navi.

08:09:56.400 --> 08:09:57.400
Oh, there he is.

08:10:01.400 --> 08:10:02.400
Mm-hmm.

08:10:05.400 --> 08:10:07.400
Um, I have a problem.

08:10:09.400 --> 08:10:13.400
And that problem is everyone has height advantage over me.

08:10:16.400 --> 08:10:17.400
Yeah, this.

08:10:18.400 --> 08:10:21.400
Unless they come down and bite me,

08:10:21.400 --> 08:10:23.400
I am in so much trouble.

08:10:26.400 --> 08:10:27.400
Oh, dear.

08:10:27.400 --> 08:10:29.400
I'm going to get sniped out of that.

08:10:29.400 --> 08:10:31.400
I don't have infinite ammo.

08:10:31.400 --> 08:10:33.400
I can't be messing around like that.

08:10:33.400 --> 08:10:34.400
I don't have infinite ammo.

08:10:35.400 --> 08:10:37.400
Is there really no way for me to go up?

08:10:42.400 --> 08:10:45.400
Unless it's over here I get up?

08:10:48.400 --> 08:10:49.400
No.

08:10:51.400 --> 08:10:54.400
Wow, this is like really rare to see in a video game.

08:10:54.400 --> 08:10:56.400
Unless I'm just, I don't play many video games.

08:10:56.400 --> 08:11:01.400
I really do not recall levels where you can't even reach the person.

08:11:02.400 --> 08:11:04.400
I don't know, maybe I'm being silly.

08:11:05.400 --> 08:11:07.400
Yeah, see this is...

08:11:07.400 --> 08:11:09.400
Right, you can go.

08:11:09.400 --> 08:11:11.400
Right, one down.

08:11:11.400 --> 08:11:14.400
I don't know how much health he has, but...

08:11:14.400 --> 08:11:18.400
Bro, I can't, I cannot be spraying him with pistols, like...

08:11:20.400 --> 08:11:22.400
Oh wait, I have infinite ammo here.

08:11:23.400 --> 08:11:25.400
Silly me, silly Billy.

08:11:26.400 --> 08:11:27.400
Hold on.

08:11:29.400 --> 08:11:31.400
I saw that shooting.

08:11:33.400 --> 08:11:35.400
I just spray him the entire time then?

08:11:36.400 --> 08:11:38.400
I mean, I'll do it, don't think I won't.

08:11:39.400 --> 08:11:42.400
You don't have to tell me twice if it's a spring-free mission, sure.

08:11:42.400 --> 08:11:45.400
He just runs around in circles over and over.

08:11:46.400 --> 08:11:49.400
Sadly, I can't seem to reach the other NPCs.

08:11:49.400 --> 08:11:52.400
Oh, they're attacking me, they're actually getting me.

08:11:52.400 --> 08:11:54.400
They're jumping me!

08:11:54.400 --> 08:11:56.400
Yeah, whoa!

08:11:57.400 --> 08:12:00.400
The AI is so brutal as a nazi.

08:12:01.400 --> 08:12:03.400
Sorry, hold on a minute.

08:12:03.400 --> 08:12:05.400
I'm starting to...

08:12:06.400 --> 08:12:09.400
I don't know if I should actually just focus on the main guy, you know what?

08:12:10.400 --> 08:12:14.400
Instead of the... I don't know if they're infinitely respawning or not.

08:12:15.400 --> 08:12:18.400
That's the reason why I want to clear them out,

08:12:18.400 --> 08:12:23.400
but I'm getting the feeling they're infinitely respawning.

08:12:23.400 --> 08:12:24.400
Maybe?

08:12:24.400 --> 08:12:27.400
Oh, I just destroyed that plant.

08:12:27.400 --> 08:12:28.400
Where is he?

08:12:28.400 --> 08:12:29.400
No.

08:12:33.400 --> 08:12:35.400
Wow, I'm like actually struggling.

08:12:35.400 --> 08:12:36.400
Wow.

08:12:36.400 --> 08:12:37.400
Okay, half health.

08:12:37.400 --> 08:12:40.400
I think just moan, I think just moan down.

08:12:40.400 --> 08:12:42.400
That's the best I got.

08:12:42.400 --> 08:12:44.400
Oh, and I'm out of ammo.

08:12:48.400 --> 08:12:50.400
Just moan down.

08:12:51.400 --> 08:12:52.400
I'm just gonna tank it.

08:12:52.400 --> 08:12:53.400
I am, I really am.

08:12:53.400 --> 08:12:55.400
I'm just gonna tank it.

08:12:56.400 --> 08:12:57.400
Where is he going?

08:13:00.400 --> 08:13:04.400
Yeah, this definitely is giving, like, battle dome unending.

08:13:07.400 --> 08:13:09.400
Thanks for waiting around until I stand up again.

08:13:09.400 --> 08:13:11.400
I actually do appreciate that, AI.

08:13:11.400 --> 08:13:13.400
Oh, that's not good.

08:13:13.400 --> 08:13:15.400
That's really not good.

08:13:19.400 --> 08:13:22.400
This is what I was worried about,

08:13:22.400 --> 08:13:25.400
but there's definitely more spawning,

08:13:25.400 --> 08:13:31.400
and I'm not quite sure what the answer is.

08:13:32.400 --> 08:13:34.400
Other than spray him.

08:13:35.400 --> 08:13:37.400
That's really the best I can do.

08:13:37.400 --> 08:13:40.400
Just hope that my weak cross here is going on.

08:13:40.400 --> 08:13:42.400
He is getting staggered.

08:13:42.400 --> 08:13:43.400
He is getting staggered.

08:13:43.400 --> 08:13:45.400
There's no denying that.

08:13:45.400 --> 08:13:48.400
But the Navi are getting out of control up here.

08:13:50.400 --> 08:13:52.400
I don't have high...

08:13:52.400 --> 08:13:54.400
The plants keep respawning.

08:13:54.400 --> 08:13:57.400
I don't know if maybe the plants have got something to do with it.

08:13:58.400 --> 08:14:00.400
The battle rifle can help you in this moment.

08:14:00.400 --> 08:14:01.400
Are you the battle rifle?

08:14:01.400 --> 08:14:02.400
No, you're not.

08:14:03.400 --> 08:14:04.400
Wait.

08:14:05.400 --> 08:14:06.400
No, you're the shotgun.

08:14:06.400 --> 08:14:07.400
Wait, am I dumb?

08:14:08.400 --> 08:14:09.400
What have I got?

08:14:09.400 --> 08:14:10.400
Shotgun and shotgun.

08:14:10.400 --> 08:14:12.400
Ah, well, that makes a lot of sense

08:14:12.400 --> 08:14:14.400
where I don't feel like nothing's happening right now.

08:14:14.400 --> 08:14:16.400
What gun?

08:14:17.400 --> 08:14:19.400
The battle rifle.

08:14:19.400 --> 08:14:20.400
Battle rifle.

08:14:20.400 --> 08:14:21.400
Or any head launcher,

08:14:21.400 --> 08:14:22.400
Neil Gunn.

08:14:23.400 --> 08:14:25.400
Is it actually called battle rifle?

08:14:25.400 --> 08:14:26.400
I've got an assault rifle,

08:14:26.400 --> 08:14:28.400
but I think that's what I've got.

08:14:28.400 --> 08:14:30.400
Is she rifle?

08:14:31.400 --> 08:14:33.400
I've got machine gun standard.

08:14:34.400 --> 08:14:35.400
Hold on, heal up.

08:14:38.400 --> 08:14:39.400
Okay, let's try this.

08:14:39.400 --> 08:14:40.400
Oh, hold on.

08:14:40.400 --> 08:14:41.400
Hold on, hold on.

08:14:41.400 --> 08:14:42.400
I'm just fluffing on my face.

08:14:42.400 --> 08:14:43.400
Hold on.

08:14:45.400 --> 08:14:46.400
Are you damaging?

08:14:47.400 --> 08:14:48.400
Leave it.

08:14:49.400 --> 08:14:50.400
Oh, okay, okay.

08:14:52.400 --> 08:14:53.400
It's like a triple barf.

08:14:53.400 --> 08:14:54.400
Okay, it's triple barf.

08:14:55.400 --> 08:14:56.400
Little...

08:14:58.400 --> 08:14:59.400
We're trying.

08:14:59.400 --> 08:15:00.400
We're trying.

08:15:00.400 --> 08:15:01.400
We're trying.

08:15:01.400 --> 08:15:02.400
That's the main thing.

08:15:02.400 --> 08:15:03.400
We can do it.

08:15:03.400 --> 08:15:04.400
We can 100% do it.

08:15:04.400 --> 08:15:05.400
I believe.

08:15:05.400 --> 08:15:06.400
I believe.

08:15:06.400 --> 08:15:08.400
It's just going to take its sweet time,

08:15:08.400 --> 08:15:11.400
especially if the game just constantly is resupplying

08:15:11.400 --> 08:15:13.400
with new Navi for this guy.

08:15:14.400 --> 08:15:16.400
It makes me think this is the last boss fight

08:15:16.400 --> 08:15:18.400
in the last map, though,

08:15:18.400 --> 08:15:21.400
because this is big.

08:15:21.400 --> 08:15:23.400
Like, this is big fight.

08:15:23.400 --> 08:15:24.400
This is...

08:15:26.400 --> 08:15:28.400
I'm going to put protection prayer on.

08:15:28.400 --> 08:15:31.400
I can hardly see his body to shoot, though.

08:15:32.400 --> 08:15:33.400
Okay, yeah.

08:15:33.400 --> 08:15:34.400
Okay, okay, okay.

08:15:34.400 --> 08:15:35.400
We're freaking dead.

08:15:35.400 --> 08:15:36.400
We don't have to do...

08:15:36.400 --> 08:15:37.400
Okay, okay.

08:15:44.400 --> 08:15:45.400
Oh, he's mad.

08:15:47.400 --> 08:15:49.400
I foiled his plans.

08:15:49.400 --> 08:15:50.400
He said,

08:15:52.400 --> 08:15:53.400
Okay, let's...

08:15:53.400 --> 08:15:54.400
Okay, okay.

08:15:54.400 --> 08:15:55.400
Hold on.

08:15:55.400 --> 08:15:56.400
Let me get up.

08:15:56.400 --> 08:15:57.400
Let me get up.

08:15:57.400 --> 08:15:58.400
Let me go up.

08:15:58.400 --> 08:15:59.400
Let me go up.

08:16:00.400 --> 08:16:01.400
Hello?

08:16:02.400 --> 08:16:03.400
Hello?

08:16:05.400 --> 08:16:07.400
I can't even heal,

08:16:07.400 --> 08:16:09.400
because I'm getting pushed against a wall.

08:16:12.400 --> 08:16:13.400
Oh, I've swapped to pistols.

08:16:13.400 --> 08:16:15.400
Thank you for swapping to pistols.

08:16:15.400 --> 08:16:17.400
The most useless out of everything.

08:16:17.400 --> 08:16:19.400
No, it's very much needed right now.

08:16:19.400 --> 08:16:20.400
Very much needed.

08:16:20.400 --> 08:16:22.400
The most useless...

08:16:22.400 --> 08:16:23.400
No.

08:16:23.400 --> 08:16:24.400
I need to go.

08:16:24.400 --> 08:16:26.400
My invis...

08:16:26.400 --> 08:16:28.400
Yeah, my invis literally...

08:16:28.400 --> 08:16:30.400
I'm going to heal on a rock.

08:16:30.400 --> 08:16:32.400
I'm going to heal on a rock.

08:16:32.400 --> 08:16:34.400
Yeah, and I'm pressed up against it,

08:16:34.400 --> 08:16:36.400
so there's actually nothing I can do.

08:16:36.400 --> 08:16:38.400
Dog, you're going to have to let me breathe

08:16:38.400 --> 08:16:39.400
through your sleep video game.

08:16:39.400 --> 08:16:40.400
This is like...

08:16:40.400 --> 08:16:41.400
I'm just going to run away.

08:16:41.400 --> 08:16:43.400
It's the best thing I can do right now.

08:16:44.400 --> 08:16:45.400
Do not engage.

08:16:45.400 --> 08:16:46.400
Do not engage.

08:16:48.400 --> 08:16:50.400
Oh, come on.

08:16:53.400 --> 08:16:55.400
Who said the same thing?

08:16:55.400 --> 08:16:57.400
Who said the same thing?

08:17:05.400 --> 08:17:07.400
Oh, no.

08:17:09.400 --> 08:17:10.400
No, no.

08:17:10.400 --> 08:17:12.400
I did not want this.

08:17:12.400 --> 08:17:14.400
Oh, goodness.

08:17:14.400 --> 08:17:16.400
Yeah, I think I've actually died.

08:17:16.400 --> 08:17:17.400
You know that?

08:17:17.400 --> 08:17:19.400
I've only got one cell thing.

08:17:21.400 --> 08:17:23.400
I'm glad I have protection up,

08:17:23.400 --> 08:17:25.400
but...

08:17:31.400 --> 08:17:33.400
I actually don't have faith.

08:17:33.400 --> 08:17:34.400
You know that?

08:17:34.400 --> 08:17:35.400
I'm losing faith.

08:17:35.400 --> 08:17:37.400
I do not believe...

08:17:37.400 --> 08:17:39.400
unless I can grab these quick enough.

08:17:39.400 --> 08:17:40.400
I literally don't have a revive,

08:17:40.400 --> 08:17:42.400
if I go down, by the way.

08:17:42.400 --> 08:17:44.400
Yeah, see this?

08:17:44.400 --> 08:17:48.400
The amount of abilities they use...

08:17:48.400 --> 08:17:50.400
I'm sure I could probably be

08:17:50.400 --> 08:17:52.400
utilizing my abilities better,

08:17:52.400 --> 08:17:54.400
but this prayer protection...

08:17:54.400 --> 08:17:57.400
is so constant!

08:17:58.400 --> 08:18:01.400
It's so fucking constant!

08:18:06.400 --> 08:18:09.400
I really hope nothing else respawns.

08:18:09.400 --> 08:18:11.400
I can't tolerate this.

08:18:12.400 --> 08:18:15.400
I don't think I should have been using that other gun.

08:18:15.400 --> 08:18:17.400
No, that's shotgun.

08:18:22.400 --> 08:18:24.400
If he's gonna get stuck,

08:18:24.400 --> 08:18:26.400
I will happily take that, please.

08:18:30.400 --> 08:18:32.400
Please, stun lock,

08:18:32.400 --> 08:18:35.400
and don't do anything different.

08:18:36.400 --> 08:18:37.400
Oh, my God.

08:18:37.400 --> 08:18:39.400
More spawned in.

08:18:40.400 --> 08:18:43.400
Please, I literally don't have a revive.

08:18:43.400 --> 08:18:46.400
I honestly don't have a revive.

08:18:46.400 --> 08:18:49.400
You know, I have ammo, look at me.

08:18:52.400 --> 08:18:54.400
Where did he go?

08:19:00.400 --> 08:19:02.400
Oh, lovely.

08:19:06.400 --> 08:19:08.400
I feel like a Lara Croft.

08:19:08.400 --> 08:19:10.400
Oh, my God!

08:19:12.400 --> 08:19:14.400
Did I have reef?

08:19:14.400 --> 08:19:16.400
I don't even have it.

08:19:17.400 --> 08:19:19.400
Please!

08:19:19.400 --> 08:19:21.400
No more battles!

08:19:21.400 --> 08:19:24.400
Please, I'm on my knees!

08:19:25.400 --> 08:19:27.400
Oh, I can't.

08:19:27.400 --> 08:19:29.400
I genuinely, wholeheartedly,

08:19:29.400 --> 08:19:32.400
I'm not gonna make it if they make me do it anymore.

08:19:32.400 --> 08:19:34.400
Is that up here?

08:19:34.400 --> 08:19:36.400
No, sorry.

08:19:37.400 --> 08:19:39.400
I need to find revives,

08:19:39.400 --> 08:19:41.400
but I don't have any more revives,

08:19:41.400 --> 08:19:44.400
and I keep getting locked in.

08:19:44.400 --> 08:19:46.400
On your knees, I'm not even kidding.

08:19:46.400 --> 08:19:48.400
On my knees, please, devs,

08:19:48.400 --> 08:19:50.400
tell me you didn't do it anymore.

08:19:50.400 --> 08:19:52.400
I think I'm genuinely gonna lose this.

08:19:52.400 --> 08:19:53.400
Like, lose the game,

08:19:53.400 --> 08:19:55.400
because I don't have a revive,

08:19:55.400 --> 08:19:57.400
and I don't know what happens if you perish

08:19:57.400 --> 08:19:59.400
without a revive.

08:20:00.400 --> 08:20:03.400
On your knees for a head pat.

08:20:04.400 --> 08:20:07.400
Oh, I genuinely don't have a revive.

08:20:07.400 --> 08:20:10.400
I feel like we're about to enter some massive boss fight.

08:20:10.400 --> 08:20:12.400
Oh, my God.

08:20:13.400 --> 08:20:16.400
Get me out of the Hanging Gardens.

08:20:17.400 --> 08:20:20.400
You're dying to keep your town, really?

08:20:20.400 --> 08:20:22.400
Shocking behavior.

08:20:23.400 --> 08:20:25.400
Oh.

08:20:25.400 --> 08:20:28.400
How am I back here again?

08:20:39.400 --> 08:20:42.400
I think because I'm not killing...

08:20:42.400 --> 08:20:44.400
Navi.

08:20:46.400 --> 08:20:48.400
Well, teammates and all, right?

08:20:48.400 --> 08:20:50.400
Yeah, right.

08:20:50.400 --> 08:20:52.400
Meet me back at Hell's Gate.

08:20:52.400 --> 08:20:54.400
This should be the last harmonic.

08:20:56.400 --> 08:20:58.400
No.

08:21:03.400 --> 08:21:06.400
I have protection for now.

08:21:06.400 --> 08:21:08.400
I think it is because I'm not...

08:21:08.400 --> 08:21:09.400
What are you...

08:21:09.400 --> 08:21:11.400
They're all aiming on something.

08:21:11.400 --> 08:21:13.400
Because I'm not picking, like,

08:21:13.400 --> 08:21:14.400
Heart and Navi,

08:21:14.400 --> 08:21:16.400
I'm not able to pick up more revives,

08:21:16.400 --> 08:21:18.400
but, like, I'm in danger.

08:21:23.400 --> 08:21:24.400
I don't know if I'm going to win this.

08:21:24.400 --> 08:21:26.400
I don't know what happened, so...

08:21:28.400 --> 08:21:30.400
On your knees ready to create a James Cameron himself,

08:21:30.400 --> 08:21:32.400
literally.

08:21:32.400 --> 08:21:34.400
I'm like, did they play test this

08:21:34.400 --> 08:21:35.400
for, like, noobs?

08:21:35.400 --> 08:21:37.400
This is, like, soul play?

08:21:37.400 --> 08:21:39.400
Monroe's gone missing.

08:21:39.400 --> 08:21:41.400
Things are going bad to worse.

08:21:41.400 --> 08:21:43.400
You'll have to upload the harmonic without him.

08:21:43.400 --> 08:21:45.400
Monroe's missing the guy?

08:21:45.400 --> 08:21:47.400
He's been rounding up the scientists

08:21:47.400 --> 08:21:49.400
and anyone else who questions his authority.

08:21:49.400 --> 08:21:51.400
We're running out of time.

08:21:51.400 --> 08:21:53.400
We need to find that door...

08:21:53.400 --> 08:21:55.400
He really is the body, jeez.

08:21:55.400 --> 08:21:57.400
It has to be you who activates the emulator.

08:21:57.400 --> 08:21:59.400
If you get control of the well of souls,

08:21:59.400 --> 08:22:01.400
you can put a stop to this madness.

08:22:01.400 --> 08:22:03.400
Get started.

08:22:03.400 --> 08:22:05.400
I'm gonna go check for Monroe.

08:22:06.400 --> 08:22:08.400
Okay, let's deal.

08:22:08.400 --> 08:22:10.400
So we are about to hit endgame.

08:22:10.400 --> 08:22:12.400
Oh, yeah, we're in the endgame now.

08:22:14.400 --> 08:22:17.400
But Alcooo actually kills your scientists, man.

08:22:17.400 --> 08:22:19.400
Yeah.

08:22:21.400 --> 08:22:23.400
They probes didn't play any at all.

08:22:23.400 --> 08:22:25.400
They had one play tester.

08:22:25.400 --> 08:22:27.400
And he just did the Navi side as well.

08:22:29.400 --> 08:22:31.400
Are you trying to finish the campaign?

08:22:31.400 --> 08:22:33.400
Yes, we finished the Navi.

08:22:33.400 --> 08:22:35.400
We finished the RDA side.

08:22:35.400 --> 08:22:37.400
However, he's not in his office.

08:22:39.400 --> 08:22:41.400
What's that?

08:22:45.400 --> 08:22:47.400
Resource development?

08:22:47.400 --> 08:22:49.400
Oh, wow, I actually can't go...

08:22:53.400 --> 08:22:55.400
I actually can't go in his office space.

08:22:55.400 --> 08:22:57.400
That's a very small detail.

08:23:04.400 --> 08:23:06.400
Oh, well.

08:23:08.400 --> 08:23:10.400
The office is scared.

08:23:10.400 --> 08:23:12.400
Alcooo is always evil.

08:23:12.400 --> 08:23:14.400
Yeah, he's like evil till the end.

08:23:14.400 --> 08:23:17.400
We can do it. We just not need to die.

08:23:17.400 --> 08:23:21.400
Or get walled off by like three Navi at once.

08:23:24.400 --> 08:23:29.400
Going into his office space to take his red line stapler?

08:23:29.400 --> 08:23:31.400
Stapler?

08:23:32.400 --> 08:23:34.400
Why are you so stupid?

08:23:38.400 --> 08:23:40.400
Okay, she gives me a thumbs up now.

08:23:53.400 --> 08:23:57.400
Wait, so you need to stop Falco in either scenario, anyway?

08:24:01.400 --> 08:24:03.400
Oh!

08:24:07.400 --> 08:24:09.400
Oh!

08:24:09.400 --> 08:24:11.400
So you never actually hurt Pandora, either way?

08:24:14.400 --> 08:24:16.400
Path of Goliath?

08:24:16.400 --> 08:24:18.400
Hydration check.

08:24:18.400 --> 08:24:20.400
My voice is dying.

08:24:20.400 --> 08:24:22.400
Okay.

08:24:27.400 --> 08:24:31.400
I hope we can put a stop to Falco with a...

08:24:31.400 --> 08:24:33.400
Wait, no.

08:24:33.400 --> 08:24:35.400
I was gonna make a joke and then that's not funny.

08:24:35.400 --> 08:24:37.400
Because it doesn't work.

08:24:37.400 --> 08:24:39.400
My joke doesn't work, so I can't make it.

08:24:39.400 --> 08:24:41.400
Falco's gone nuts.

08:24:41.400 --> 08:24:43.400
Basically, scenario is planning on using it to take over the plan for himself.

08:24:43.400 --> 08:24:45.400
Lightly, scenario, world ending.

08:24:46.400 --> 08:24:49.400
Dude, I was gonna make a Falcon Punch joke.

08:24:50.400 --> 08:24:56.400
I'm gonna be like, oh, I'm gonna Falcon Punch if I just don't want him.

08:24:56.400 --> 08:24:59.400
Tell him, okay, alright, okay.

08:24:59.400 --> 08:25:01.400
Oh, we need to stop Falcon.

08:25:01.400 --> 08:25:04.400
Maybe we'll give him a Falcon Punch.

08:25:07.400 --> 08:25:09.400
Oh, sorry, sorry guys.

08:25:09.400 --> 08:25:11.400
Sorry.

08:25:11.400 --> 08:25:13.400
You want crickets on that one instead?

08:25:17.400 --> 08:25:19.400
Sorry about that.

08:25:19.400 --> 08:25:21.400
Please!

08:25:21.400 --> 08:25:24.400
Well, this map looks more forgiven for one rate away,

08:25:24.400 --> 08:25:27.400
because my goodness, that last one was just in the nightmare.

08:25:27.400 --> 08:25:32.400
I have access to mechs in this map, which is curious.

08:25:32.400 --> 08:25:35.400
They don't always have a lot of crickets.

08:25:35.400 --> 08:25:40.400
I have access to mechs in this map, which is curious.

08:25:40.400 --> 08:25:43.400
They don't always have an access to mech.

08:25:43.400 --> 08:25:46.400
Yeah, tough crowd.

08:25:46.400 --> 08:25:50.400
Not allowed to go out that way, or...

08:25:50.400 --> 08:25:53.400
Excuse me, I would like to out, please.

08:25:53.400 --> 08:25:56.400
Can only go out of the green doors, got it.

08:25:56.400 --> 08:25:58.400
That one green?

08:25:58.400 --> 08:26:01.400
Nope, that one's red.

08:26:01.400 --> 08:26:06.400
Not only one door to go out of, for some odd reason.

08:26:07.400 --> 08:26:14.400
Give him a Falcon Need to the Moon, first of all.

08:26:14.400 --> 08:26:17.400
Oh, to the north, sorry.

08:26:17.400 --> 08:26:20.400
Right, those are from the...

08:26:21.400 --> 08:26:24.400
I basically just go all the way straight ahead,

08:26:24.400 --> 08:26:27.400
and I can pick a tree and then come back and get him.

08:26:28.400 --> 08:26:33.400
Yeah, they're like so much easier like this.

08:26:33.400 --> 08:26:35.400
Oh my God.

08:26:37.400 --> 08:26:40.400
Section Challenge Initiated.

08:26:48.400 --> 08:26:50.400
Oh, there's one...

08:26:50.400 --> 08:26:52.400
Jumping mech.

08:26:53.400 --> 08:26:57.400
I don't know if I should get out and pick up these RDS things.

08:26:57.400 --> 08:27:00.400
You know that, because I actually don't have a second chance.

08:27:00.400 --> 08:27:04.400
I might against my better judgement, I hope I'm right.

08:27:09.400 --> 08:27:14.400
At least if I can have one revive, I don't need to panic too much.

08:27:17.400 --> 08:27:19.400
Just need one revive.

08:27:19.400 --> 08:27:22.400
Should I camp for it, maybe?

08:27:22.400 --> 08:27:24.400
Maybe not, maybe not.

08:27:24.400 --> 08:27:28.400
I still don't have one though, I need one more kill.

08:27:28.400 --> 08:27:32.400
I'll get out when I find the next one.

08:27:32.400 --> 08:27:35.400
Oh my God, it's time for three!

08:27:35.400 --> 08:27:37.400
Okay, what if I go this way?

08:27:37.400 --> 08:27:39.400
It's still the right path.

08:27:40.400 --> 08:27:42.400
Okay, what's the path?

08:27:53.400 --> 08:27:55.400
Alright, run it over.

08:27:57.400 --> 08:28:00.400
Oh, I need one RDA, one RDA.

08:28:00.400 --> 08:28:03.400
Two can earn.

08:28:10.400 --> 08:28:13.400
I'm just glad I'm allowed to bring the mech for once.

08:28:15.400 --> 08:28:17.400
There's a Warhawk too.

08:28:24.400 --> 08:28:26.400
Okay, there's one there.

08:28:29.400 --> 08:28:35.400
But if it's safe to get out, I will pick it up, but...

08:28:39.400 --> 08:28:41.400
Okay.

08:28:41.400 --> 08:28:43.400
I'm getting hammered.

08:28:57.400 --> 08:29:00.400
There, we'll grab this one.

08:29:00.400 --> 08:29:02.400
Whoa, whoa!

08:29:02.400 --> 08:29:04.400
This is what I didn't want.

08:29:04.400 --> 08:29:07.400
Can I get into our camp, please?

08:29:07.400 --> 08:29:09.400
No, I can't, I'm not allowed to get back in,

08:29:09.400 --> 08:29:12.400
because I've just gone ahead and destroyed it, lovely jewel blue.

08:29:12.400 --> 08:29:16.400
I'm going to quickly get this teleport up here,

08:29:16.400 --> 08:29:18.400
just because...

08:29:18.400 --> 08:29:20.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:29:20.400 --> 08:29:22.400
I'm getting it, I'm getting it.

08:29:22.400 --> 08:29:25.400
The mech is so fun, just moving down.

08:29:25.400 --> 08:29:29.400
Just mowing down the Nuffie in the little wild life.

08:29:29.400 --> 08:29:31.400
That's him.

08:29:31.400 --> 08:29:33.400
But it's so true, really.

08:29:33.400 --> 08:29:35.400
Alright, let's try this.

08:29:35.400 --> 08:29:39.400
Maybe we can get around and not be so annihilated.

08:29:46.400 --> 08:29:49.400
Oh, lovely, it doesn't even let you pass.

08:29:49.400 --> 08:29:51.400
Oh, there.

08:29:51.400 --> 08:29:53.400
A terrible driver.

08:29:53.400 --> 08:29:56.400
Oh, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

08:29:56.400 --> 08:30:00.400
We've made it nice and impossible to drive as they always do.

08:30:00.400 --> 08:30:02.400
Can I even get past that?

08:30:02.400 --> 08:30:04.400
Okay, Justin no more.

08:30:05.400 --> 08:30:07.400
Give me a little spank there.

08:30:07.400 --> 08:30:09.400
I hope they're here.

08:30:09.400 --> 08:30:12.400
I can, it's green, thank goodness.

08:30:14.400 --> 08:30:18.400
Let's have to beat this teleport station.

08:30:20.400 --> 08:30:25.400
And then, we can start the mission location.

08:30:25.400 --> 08:30:29.400
You're getting bow-inked so hard.

08:30:29.400 --> 08:30:31.400
I heard good things.

08:30:31.400 --> 08:30:33.400
I'm Colonel Clark.

08:30:33.400 --> 08:30:36.400
Our assault is underway on the Navi strongholds.

08:30:36.400 --> 08:30:38.400
But these guys fight like animals.

08:30:38.400 --> 08:30:41.400
I need you to go in and get their top of command.

08:30:41.400 --> 08:30:44.400
Break the morale and turn the tide in our favor.

08:30:44.400 --> 08:30:46.400
Let's turn the tide.

08:30:46.400 --> 08:30:48.400
Commander Falco's running on his own.

08:30:48.400 --> 08:30:50.400
If I don't stop him.

08:30:50.400 --> 08:30:52.400
You think you're running your own show?

08:30:52.400 --> 08:30:54.400
That was Falco's mistake.

08:30:54.400 --> 08:30:57.400
We're trying to stop Falco, but if we don't take out the commander's first,

08:30:57.400 --> 08:31:00.400
I saw the AMP between the gate and where you are now.

08:31:03.400 --> 08:31:04.400
A free amp?

08:31:04.400 --> 08:31:06.400
Oh, sorry, possibly.

08:31:06.400 --> 08:31:08.400
They spawned it.

08:31:10.400 --> 08:31:12.400
Is it encouraged from the guy from his first movie?

08:31:12.400 --> 08:31:13.400
I think so.

08:31:13.400 --> 08:31:17.400
They seem to have been able to get the likeness of everyone.

08:31:17.400 --> 08:31:20.400
Like Sigourney Weaver was at the start of it as well.

08:31:20.400 --> 08:31:23.400
So it seems like when this game was made,

08:31:23.400 --> 08:31:26.400
they got the rights to do some tricks.

08:31:27.400 --> 08:31:30.400
The new brass said they were sending me a problem solver.

08:31:30.400 --> 08:31:32.400
I should have known it was you.

08:31:32.400 --> 08:31:34.400
How's your day been, Batista?

08:31:34.400 --> 08:31:35.400
Painful.

08:31:35.400 --> 08:31:36.400
I got a whole list of them.

08:31:36.400 --> 08:31:37.400
I don't think I've ever heard that name.

08:31:37.400 --> 08:31:38.400
Batista.

08:31:38.400 --> 08:31:41.400
The blues keep sending in their damn birds to turn us back.

08:31:41.400 --> 08:31:42.400
How can I help?

08:31:42.400 --> 08:31:43.400
Batista.

08:31:43.400 --> 08:31:45.400
They ain't moving until their leader comes.

08:31:45.400 --> 08:31:47.400
Go by the name of Swata.

08:31:47.400 --> 08:31:49.400
You make Swata go ta ta.

08:31:49.400 --> 08:31:51.400
And I bet the rest of them will leave us alone.

08:31:51.400 --> 08:31:53.400
You make Swata go ta ta.

08:31:53.400 --> 08:31:55.400
I knew you would be.

08:31:58.400 --> 08:32:01.400
Okay, another boss that you fight.

08:32:01.400 --> 08:32:03.400
Yippee!

08:32:03.400 --> 08:32:04.400
Where is he?

08:32:04.400 --> 08:32:05.400
Um, right.

08:32:05.400 --> 08:32:07.400
Can I take a car, please?

08:32:07.400 --> 08:32:08.400
Just to really speed things up.

08:32:08.400 --> 08:32:10.400
I don't, I have to admit that last map.

08:32:10.400 --> 08:32:11.400
Absolutely.

08:32:11.400 --> 08:32:12.400
Oof.

08:32:12.400 --> 08:32:13.400
That was rough.

08:32:13.400 --> 08:32:15.400
But this map, like, literally,

08:32:15.400 --> 08:32:17.400
they're giving you, like, so much stuff.

08:32:17.400 --> 08:32:20.400
I assume I can glide over the water with this.

08:32:20.400 --> 08:32:23.400
So I'm just going to automatically break now.

08:32:23.400 --> 08:32:25.400
Oh, sorry.

08:32:25.400 --> 08:32:28.400
If they give, literally give me a bit of mobility

08:32:28.400 --> 08:32:30.400
and make it easy to move around,

08:32:30.400 --> 08:32:33.400
then it's all good.

08:32:33.400 --> 08:32:35.400
Is it left or right up here?

08:32:35.400 --> 08:32:37.400
It's a right.

08:32:38.400 --> 08:32:39.400
Oops, sorry.

08:32:39.400 --> 08:32:40.400
That was a rock.

08:32:40.400 --> 08:32:41.400
I didn't see it.

08:32:41.400 --> 08:32:42.400
I've not got my glasses on.

08:32:42.400 --> 08:32:43.400
Tee-hee.

08:32:43.400 --> 08:32:45.400
Oops, I'm hitting the curb.

08:32:45.400 --> 08:32:46.400
Tee, just Tee-hee.

08:32:46.400 --> 08:32:47.400
A little Tee-hee moment.

08:32:47.400 --> 08:32:48.400
A little Tee-hee moment.

08:32:48.400 --> 08:32:49.400
Sorry, sorry.

08:32:49.400 --> 08:32:50.400
I need my lights on.

08:32:50.400 --> 08:32:51.400
Oh, oh, sorry.

08:32:51.400 --> 08:32:53.400
Never saw that, my bad.

08:32:53.400 --> 08:32:55.400
Right, I'm doing a circle, I guess.

08:32:55.400 --> 08:32:57.400
And I'm going back on the road over here.

08:32:57.400 --> 08:32:58.400
Oh.

08:33:00.400 --> 08:33:02.400
Wait, what the heck is the road?

08:33:03.400 --> 08:33:04.400
Here?

08:33:06.400 --> 08:33:07.400
Oh, sorry.

08:33:07.400 --> 08:33:08.400
Oh, right.

08:33:08.400 --> 08:33:09.400
I'll just see you take a right.

08:33:09.400 --> 08:33:11.400
Oh, it's a tight, it's a tight left.

08:33:11.400 --> 08:33:12.400
Sorry.

08:33:12.400 --> 08:33:14.400
I don't know the difference between my left and right.

08:33:14.400 --> 08:33:15.400
I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.

08:33:15.400 --> 08:33:17.400
Got to stick my hand up in order to know what it's what.

08:33:17.400 --> 08:33:19.400
Right, okay, okay.

08:33:19.400 --> 08:33:21.400
Let's just speed around down.

08:33:21.400 --> 08:33:23.400
Yep, let's just do that.

08:33:23.400 --> 08:33:26.400
And then we just gently can't claim it.

08:33:26.400 --> 08:33:28.400
Can't claim it.

08:33:28.400 --> 08:33:30.400
Can't claim it or can't claim it?

08:33:30.400 --> 08:33:31.400
Bank!

08:33:31.400 --> 08:33:34.400
Oh, I've got my bus banked by two of them at once.

08:33:34.400 --> 08:33:35.400
Please don't.

08:33:35.400 --> 08:33:37.400
Did they know how to claim?

08:33:37.400 --> 08:33:38.400
Or how?

08:33:38.400 --> 08:33:40.400
Oh, they've not been coded to claim.

08:33:40.400 --> 08:33:41.400
I like it.

08:33:41.400 --> 08:33:43.400
I like it.

08:33:46.400 --> 08:33:48.400
Oh, it's cool.

08:33:49.400 --> 08:33:51.400
Cut off his driving moment.

08:33:51.400 --> 08:33:52.400
Look, I got eight arms.

08:33:52.400 --> 08:33:54.400
It's hard to like really figure it one.

08:33:54.400 --> 08:33:56.400
I can try to.

08:33:56.400 --> 08:33:58.400
I'm claiming very high.

08:34:01.400 --> 08:34:04.400
Final boss question mark, maybe?

08:34:04.400 --> 08:34:06.400
Whoa, why is he?

08:34:12.400 --> 08:34:13.400
Oh.

08:34:19.400 --> 08:34:22.400
They are responsible for your Falco's madness.

08:34:22.400 --> 08:34:26.400
You can stop Falco and you can help people.

08:34:26.400 --> 08:34:28.400
Wait, am I allowed to join them?

08:34:28.400 --> 08:34:30.400
Or am I not to join them?

08:34:33.400 --> 08:34:34.400
Oh, I don't even have a...

08:34:34.400 --> 08:34:36.400
Choose a side in this final battle.

08:34:36.400 --> 08:34:38.400
Wait, what did I do?

08:34:38.400 --> 08:34:39.400
Freedom of choice.

08:34:39.400 --> 08:34:41.400
Attempt, good or remain evil.

08:34:41.400 --> 08:34:43.400
Not join.

08:34:43.400 --> 08:34:45.400
I'm supposed to be evil.

08:34:45.400 --> 08:34:46.400
RDA?

08:34:46.400 --> 08:34:47.400
Hmm.

08:34:49.400 --> 08:34:50.400
Okay.

08:34:50.400 --> 08:34:51.400
Wait, what did I do?

08:34:51.400 --> 08:34:52.400
Did I choose...

08:34:52.400 --> 08:34:56.400
I want to choose RDA, so I stand in RDA, right?

08:34:58.400 --> 08:35:03.400
I want to be evil, so I stand in the RDA side.

08:35:03.400 --> 08:35:04.400
Right?

08:35:05.400 --> 08:35:07.400
Choose to stay with RDA.

08:35:08.400 --> 08:35:10.400
He's taking his bow out!

08:35:10.400 --> 08:35:11.400
He's taking his bow out!

08:35:11.400 --> 08:35:14.400
Oh my God, I literally just heard the sound effect.

08:35:17.400 --> 08:35:18.400
Uh...

08:35:18.400 --> 08:35:22.400
Mate, you're going to have to give me some space, mate.

08:35:22.400 --> 08:35:24.400
You never tasted lead before.

08:35:24.400 --> 08:35:27.400
I'm sure you haven't since we humans came here.

08:35:27.400 --> 08:35:28.400
Oh, fuck.

08:35:28.400 --> 08:35:30.400
And now I'm eating lead.

08:35:30.400 --> 08:35:32.400
I'm eating the freaking bow string.

08:35:35.400 --> 08:35:36.400
Oh!

08:35:38.400 --> 08:35:39.400
I didn't...

08:35:39.400 --> 08:35:40.400
Oh!

08:35:40.400 --> 08:35:42.400
Oh my!

08:35:42.400 --> 08:35:45.400
While I leave you in the hands of fate.

08:35:46.400 --> 08:35:47.400
Um...

08:35:47.400 --> 08:35:50.400
I did not expect that, Lamal.

08:35:51.400 --> 08:35:52.400
Um...

08:35:52.400 --> 08:35:54.400
I guess I just go back, please.

08:35:56.400 --> 08:35:57.400
It...

08:35:57.400 --> 08:35:58.400
That...

08:35:58.400 --> 08:36:00.400
Yeah, get move fast, though, honestly.

08:36:00.400 --> 08:36:02.400
Right, if I go...

08:36:02.400 --> 08:36:03.400
Wait, how did I even get here?

08:36:03.400 --> 08:36:04.400
I climbed up.

08:36:04.400 --> 08:36:07.400
Can I climb down on these, or does it not let you climb down?

08:36:07.400 --> 08:36:08.400
I don't want to get...

08:36:08.400 --> 08:36:10.400
Oh no, it does let you climb down.

08:36:10.400 --> 08:36:11.400
How strange.

08:36:11.400 --> 08:36:13.400
I remember I touched that rope, another one,

08:36:13.400 --> 08:36:16.400
and the option never came up.

08:36:19.400 --> 08:36:20.400
It's still going strong as already.

08:36:20.400 --> 08:36:21.400
It looks like...

08:36:21.400 --> 08:36:22.400
What did I miss?

08:36:22.400 --> 08:36:23.400
Um...

08:36:23.400 --> 08:36:26.400
You missed the last map, which was horrific,

08:36:26.400 --> 08:36:28.400
and you should actually be...

08:36:28.400 --> 08:36:29.400
Am I going the right way?

08:36:29.400 --> 08:36:30.400
I'm getting so kind of them.

08:36:30.400 --> 08:36:32.400
You should be really glad you missed it.

08:36:32.400 --> 08:36:34.400
The map layout was horrific.

08:36:34.400 --> 08:36:37.400
Like, it was telling you to go like all these different ways,

08:36:37.400 --> 08:36:39.400
and it was all squiggly wiggly,

08:36:39.400 --> 08:36:43.400
and super detailed and complete.

08:36:45.400 --> 08:36:47.400
You scared me!

08:36:47.400 --> 08:36:49.400
Oh, please drive.

08:36:50.400 --> 08:36:53.400
Right, just get back on the road

08:36:53.400 --> 08:36:56.400
and go the path I've already been.

08:36:58.400 --> 08:37:00.400
Oh, oh, I'm so sorry.

08:37:00.400 --> 08:37:02.400
I didn't mean to hurt you, little horse.

08:37:04.400 --> 08:37:07.400
Uh, then take a right or a left.

08:37:07.400 --> 08:37:09.400
Take a right.

08:37:10.400 --> 08:37:11.400
And then...

08:37:11.400 --> 08:37:12.400
Whoa!

08:37:12.400 --> 08:37:14.400
Oh, I thought it was a cliff.

08:37:15.400 --> 08:37:16.400
Whoa, camera angle.

08:37:16.400 --> 08:37:17.400
You could be...

08:37:17.400 --> 08:37:19.400
I have to admit, the camera angle could be

08:37:19.400 --> 08:37:22.400
a wee bit more, like, forgiven.

08:37:22.400 --> 08:37:24.400
It's, like, constantly wanting to, like,

08:37:24.400 --> 08:37:26.400
drive me into the ground for some reason.

08:37:27.400 --> 08:37:29.400
Up my way, RDA.

08:37:29.400 --> 08:37:31.400
Up my way, RDA.

08:37:31.400 --> 08:37:33.400
Cause you're in my way, RDA.

08:37:33.400 --> 08:37:35.400
I said you're in my way, RDA.

08:37:35.400 --> 08:37:37.400
It's up my way, RDA.

08:37:37.400 --> 08:37:39.400
It's up my way, RDA.

08:37:39.400 --> 08:37:41.400
It's cinema.

08:37:41.400 --> 08:37:43.400
Navi jumpscare.

08:37:43.400 --> 08:37:46.400
After all these struggles getting bullied by the AI,

08:37:46.400 --> 08:37:48.400
the game felt bad and was just letting me,

08:37:48.400 --> 08:37:50.400
like, get through it.

08:37:50.400 --> 08:37:52.400
Seriously, that last map, though.

08:37:52.400 --> 08:37:54.400
I'll take that one to my grave.

08:37:54.400 --> 08:37:56.400
We just hate the hanging cliff.

08:37:56.400 --> 08:37:58.400
Woo-wee!

08:38:07.400 --> 08:38:09.400
Yeah, you're not gonna wait until the...

08:38:09.400 --> 08:38:10.400
Yeah.

08:38:10.400 --> 08:38:13.400
103 field commanders.

08:38:13.400 --> 08:38:15.400
Okay.

08:38:16.400 --> 08:38:18.400
And then, surely, the game's over.

08:38:24.400 --> 08:38:26.400
Mm-hmm.

08:38:29.400 --> 08:38:31.400
Mm-hmm.

08:38:41.400 --> 08:38:43.400
Mm-hmm.

08:38:45.400 --> 08:38:47.400
Alright, we're heading...

08:38:47.400 --> 08:38:49.400
How far away is it? Oh!

08:38:49.400 --> 08:38:51.400
Someone was smart enough to go ahead

08:38:51.400 --> 08:38:53.400
and activate that teleport just in case

08:38:53.400 --> 08:38:55.400
we were doing a little back and forth.

08:38:55.400 --> 08:38:57.400
And...

08:38:57.400 --> 08:38:59.400
We actually need to teleport to it.

08:38:59.400 --> 08:39:01.400
I am so smart.

08:39:01.400 --> 08:39:03.400
S-M-A-R-T.

08:39:03.400 --> 08:39:05.400
I was gonna do the Homer Simpson way.

08:39:05.400 --> 08:39:07.400
S-M-R-T.

08:39:07.400 --> 08:39:09.400
I am so smart.

08:39:09.400 --> 08:39:11.400
Said you're in my way, R-T-A.

08:39:11.400 --> 08:39:13.400
Oh!

08:39:13.400 --> 08:39:15.400
Well...

08:39:15.400 --> 08:39:17.400
You know what? I've literally just spawned here.

08:39:17.400 --> 08:39:19.400
I'm going to come down, actually.

08:39:19.400 --> 08:39:21.400
Actually, everyone just pause.

08:39:21.400 --> 08:39:23.400
I've been reported here, and I'm already getting...

08:39:23.400 --> 08:39:25.400
enrolled.

08:39:25.400 --> 08:39:27.400
Oh, so now you're agreeing with me, smart.

08:39:27.400 --> 08:39:29.400
No, the S-M-R-T.

08:39:29.400 --> 08:39:31.400
That...

08:39:33.400 --> 08:39:35.400
Well, let's hope there's not too many...

08:39:35.400 --> 08:39:38.400
How is there a tree of souls here?

08:39:39.400 --> 08:39:41.400
Unless, when you swap to the Navi,

08:39:41.400 --> 08:39:43.400
you get a Navi body?

08:39:43.400 --> 08:39:45.400
That's what I need.

08:39:47.400 --> 08:39:49.400
He's on a Thanator!

08:39:49.400 --> 08:39:51.400
He's on a Thanator!

08:39:59.400 --> 08:40:01.400
Yeah!

08:40:01.400 --> 08:40:03.400
I need height advantage.

08:40:03.400 --> 08:40:05.400
Is there anything I can take height advantage on?

08:40:05.400 --> 08:40:07.400
There's a f***ing thing going to chase me on my boho!

08:40:09.400 --> 08:40:11.400
I'm now getting...

08:40:11.400 --> 08:40:13.400
I'm now getting wrecked by his pals as well.

08:40:13.400 --> 08:40:15.400
Not cast... I cast protection.

08:40:15.400 --> 08:40:17.400
I just activated, like, five NPCs

08:40:17.400 --> 08:40:19.400
to join in!

08:40:25.400 --> 08:40:27.400
I can't even run out of the way in time.

08:40:29.400 --> 08:40:31.400
This is insane!

08:40:31.400 --> 08:40:33.400
This is insane.

08:40:33.400 --> 08:40:35.400
I don't know what to do.

08:40:35.400 --> 08:40:37.400
There's, like, literally nothing I can cheese on.

08:40:37.400 --> 08:40:39.400
Please, can I cheese on this?

08:40:39.400 --> 08:40:41.400
Oh, please, oh, please let me cheese on this so badly.

08:40:41.400 --> 08:40:43.400
Please, please.

08:40:43.400 --> 08:40:45.400
Oh, my God, let me cheese on this so badly.

08:40:45.400 --> 08:40:47.400
Let me cheese on this so badly.

08:40:47.400 --> 08:40:49.400
I'm cheesing!

08:40:49.400 --> 08:40:51.400
I'm cheesing!

08:40:51.400 --> 08:40:53.400
I'm cheesing so hard right now.

08:40:53.400 --> 08:40:55.400
I'm not cheesing!

08:40:55.400 --> 08:40:57.400
I'm not cheesing!

08:40:57.400 --> 08:40:59.400
I know!

08:40:59.400 --> 08:41:01.400
Okay, okay, they all got pushed off.

08:41:01.400 --> 08:41:03.400
They all got pushed off.

08:41:03.400 --> 08:41:05.400
Oh, my God!

08:41:05.400 --> 08:41:07.400
Uncheese! Uncheese!

08:41:07.400 --> 08:41:09.400
Uncheese command! Uncheese command!

08:41:09.400 --> 08:41:11.400
Uncheese command! Uncheese command!

08:41:11.400 --> 08:41:13.400
Right now, uncheasing.

08:41:13.400 --> 08:41:15.400
Uncheasing.

08:41:15.400 --> 08:41:17.400
Uncheasing.

08:41:17.400 --> 08:41:19.400
Uncheasing.

08:41:19.400 --> 08:41:21.400
Uncheasing.

08:41:21.400 --> 08:41:23.400
You are all going to need to, like,

08:41:23.400 --> 08:41:25.400
stop with this freaking blasting thing.

08:41:25.400 --> 08:41:27.400
This is an absolute nightmare.

08:41:27.400 --> 08:41:29.400
Like, all of them are using...

08:41:29.400 --> 08:41:31.400
I can't...

08:41:31.400 --> 08:41:33.400
I can't.

08:41:35.400 --> 08:41:37.400
I hate to be the

08:41:37.400 --> 08:41:39.400
uh, oo-oo girl that goes,

08:41:39.400 --> 08:41:41.400
I literally can't right now!

08:41:41.400 --> 08:41:43.400
I literally can't right now.

08:41:43.400 --> 08:41:45.400
I don't even know where the Thanator is.

08:41:45.400 --> 08:41:47.400
Is the Thanator stuck?

08:41:47.400 --> 08:41:49.400
I hope I've at least cheesed the Thanator.

08:41:49.400 --> 08:41:51.400
Are you stuck?

08:41:51.400 --> 08:41:53.400
Oh, thank the maker!

08:41:53.400 --> 08:41:55.400
Thank the maker!

08:41:55.400 --> 08:41:57.400
This is a buggy old 2009 game.

08:41:59.400 --> 08:42:01.400
He led

08:42:01.400 --> 08:42:03.400
in puke

08:42:03.400 --> 08:42:05.400
because, oh, my

08:42:05.400 --> 08:42:07.400
gosh, this game is so hard.

08:42:07.400 --> 08:42:09.400
So hard.

08:42:09.400 --> 08:42:11.400
I heard that. I heard you.

08:42:11.400 --> 08:42:13.400
I literally just heard you spawning.

08:42:15.400 --> 08:42:17.400
Oh, yeah, and just heal up. No, it's fine, it's fine.

08:42:17.400 --> 08:42:19.400
Just heal all your health, it's fine.

08:42:19.400 --> 08:42:21.400
It doesn't matter.

08:42:21.400 --> 08:42:23.400
No, it doesn't matter at all.

08:42:23.400 --> 08:42:25.400
Get out of my face!

08:42:25.400 --> 08:42:27.400
No! No!

08:42:29.400 --> 08:42:31.400
All the time!

08:42:31.400 --> 08:42:33.400
Get out! I'm literally

08:42:33.400 --> 08:42:35.400
freaking walling on stuff.

08:42:35.400 --> 08:42:37.400
Go away!

08:42:39.400 --> 08:42:41.400
Stop healing!

08:42:41.400 --> 08:42:43.400
Stop healing!

08:42:43.400 --> 08:42:45.400
Stop!

08:42:47.400 --> 08:42:49.400
I need to reload like this.

08:42:49.400 --> 08:42:51.400
Right now.

08:42:51.400 --> 08:42:53.400
Yeah, hold on. Let me take a breather.

08:42:53.400 --> 08:42:55.400
I just needed one breather.

08:42:55.400 --> 08:42:57.400
Literally a second.

08:42:57.400 --> 08:42:59.400
Formulate a thought!

08:43:01.400 --> 08:43:03.400
Ah!

08:43:05.400 --> 08:43:07.400
Ah, the freaking...

08:43:09.400 --> 08:43:11.400
I'm trying so hard.

08:43:11.400 --> 08:43:13.400
I literally am trying so hard.

08:43:13.400 --> 08:43:15.400
This is just...

08:43:15.400 --> 08:43:17.400
And then there's just small more navi there.

08:43:17.400 --> 08:43:19.400
They're coming down the hill.

08:43:19.400 --> 08:43:21.400
No, I'm stuck against something.

08:43:23.400 --> 08:43:25.400
Oh, please!

08:43:25.400 --> 08:43:27.400
Please!

08:43:27.400 --> 08:43:29.400
Oh.

08:43:29.400 --> 08:43:31.400
I'm...

08:43:31.400 --> 08:43:33.400
I cast protection.

08:43:35.400 --> 08:43:37.400
Oh.

08:43:37.400 --> 08:43:39.400
Oh, and I'm...

08:43:39.400 --> 08:43:41.400
I don't do that.

08:43:41.400 --> 08:43:43.400
Don't do that again. That's not funny.

08:43:51.400 --> 08:43:53.400
I'm going to fucking lose it

08:43:53.400 --> 08:43:55.400
if I actually die here.

08:43:55.400 --> 08:43:57.400
Go and just perish!

08:43:57.400 --> 08:43:59.400
To the elements or something!

08:43:59.400 --> 08:44:01.400
This is insane!

08:44:01.400 --> 08:44:03.400
This is...

08:44:03.400 --> 08:44:05.400
No.

08:44:05.400 --> 08:44:07.400
Get staggered beyond belief

08:44:07.400 --> 08:44:09.400
and they don't stagger when they use that ability.

08:44:09.400 --> 08:44:11.400
And their ability,

08:44:11.400 --> 08:44:13.400
freaking, is on cooldown.

08:44:13.400 --> 08:44:15.400
There's no such thing as cooldown to them.

08:44:15.400 --> 08:44:17.400
They actually don't know what it is.

08:44:17.400 --> 08:44:19.400
But my cooldown lasts forever!

08:44:19.400 --> 08:44:21.400
Literally, I can't even cast protection.

08:44:25.400 --> 08:44:27.400
Oh, and I need to reload at the stupid

08:44:27.400 --> 08:44:29.400
freaking orange box!

08:44:29.400 --> 08:44:31.400
And I've got one!

08:44:31.400 --> 08:44:33.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:44:35.400 --> 08:44:37.400
No one's surprised!

08:44:41.400 --> 08:44:43.400
Freaking spraying!

08:44:43.400 --> 08:44:45.400
There's literally no more health.

08:44:45.400 --> 08:44:47.400
And you just do it again!

08:44:47.400 --> 08:44:49.400
Again with the same move!

08:44:51.400 --> 08:44:53.400
Oh, this is getting ridiculous, mate.

08:44:53.400 --> 08:44:55.400
I'm going to just get a rest, honestly.

08:44:55.400 --> 08:44:57.400
Oh, and you'd repel back to health again

08:44:57.400 --> 08:44:59.400
because you can't even just 1v

08:44:59.400 --> 08:45:01.400
fucking 1v!

08:45:01.400 --> 08:45:03.400
Literally, I'm not being funny, but

08:45:03.400 --> 08:45:05.400
if these are supposed to be avatars

08:45:05.400 --> 08:45:07.400
with titanium bones and stuff,

08:45:07.400 --> 08:45:09.400
and you literally can't 1v 1v

08:45:09.400 --> 08:45:11.400
without fucking prayer protection on

08:45:11.400 --> 08:45:13.400
every 2 seconds

08:45:13.400 --> 08:45:15.400
with that stupid move!

08:45:19.400 --> 08:45:21.400
Oh, fucking terrible ass game.

08:45:23.400 --> 08:45:25.400
Just perish!

08:45:25.400 --> 08:45:27.400
Honestly, stop using these abilities!

08:45:29.400 --> 08:45:31.400
Oh, my!

08:45:31.400 --> 08:45:33.400
God, man!

08:45:35.400 --> 08:45:37.400
Yay, we did it!

08:45:37.400 --> 08:45:39.400
Let's go!

08:45:39.400 --> 08:45:41.400
Oh, I'm so glad that's over with.

08:45:41.400 --> 08:45:43.400
Let's move on to the next one.

08:45:43.400 --> 08:45:45.400
Yippee!

08:45:45.400 --> 08:45:47.400
Yeah, and they're already showing me.

08:45:47.400 --> 08:45:49.400
Alright, we'll teleport.

08:45:49.400 --> 08:45:51.400
GG, easy.

08:45:51.400 --> 08:45:53.400
I keep forgetting that I'm not as tall

08:45:53.400 --> 08:45:55.400
as Navi, so I can't just, like, jump

08:45:55.400 --> 08:45:57.400
it. Oh, well, I

08:45:57.400 --> 08:45:59.400
didn't need to go on that, so, sure, whatever.

08:45:59.400 --> 08:46:01.400
We did it!

08:46:01.400 --> 08:46:03.400
That was awful.

08:46:03.400 --> 08:46:05.400
That was awful.

08:46:05.400 --> 08:46:07.400
You don't even pick

08:46:07.400 --> 08:46:09.400
the difficulty in this thing.

08:46:09.400 --> 08:46:11.400
My controller is literally dripping with sweat.

08:46:11.400 --> 08:46:13.400
I thought you loved having autism.

08:46:13.400 --> 08:46:15.400
It's such a nice little fun treat on the side, isn't it?

08:46:15.400 --> 08:46:17.400
Not.

08:46:17.400 --> 08:46:19.400
Oh, and I get to do one more.

08:46:19.400 --> 08:46:21.400
The protection prayer made me think

08:46:21.400 --> 08:46:23.400
this was a runescape stream for a second.

08:46:23.400 --> 08:46:25.400
Yeah, literally.

08:46:27.400 --> 08:46:29.400
If I could cast it.

08:46:29.400 --> 08:46:31.400
Oh.

08:46:35.400 --> 08:46:37.400
Is there a donation? Did I miss a donation?

08:46:37.400 --> 08:46:39.400
I think it's working.

08:46:39.400 --> 08:46:41.400
I don't know. Someone said they couldn't, but then

08:46:41.400 --> 08:46:43.400
I think a few more donations came

08:46:43.400 --> 08:46:45.400
after that, so I don't know

08:46:45.400 --> 08:46:47.400
if it's messing up on

08:46:47.400 --> 08:46:49.400
Firefox or things are just not happy.

08:46:49.400 --> 08:46:51.400
Don't worry about it

08:46:51.400 --> 08:46:53.400
if it's not working.

08:46:55.400 --> 08:46:57.400
Oh, sorry.

08:46:57.400 --> 08:46:59.400
I just...

08:46:59.400 --> 08:47:01.400
I just choked on that.

08:47:01.400 --> 08:47:03.400
Did you plane?

08:47:03.400 --> 08:47:05.400
Take a scorpion and report to the

08:47:05.400 --> 08:47:07.400
last commander.

08:47:09.400 --> 08:47:11.400
Let's try it.

08:47:15.400 --> 08:47:17.400
You'll read it later.

08:47:17.400 --> 08:47:19.400
I just sent one a bit ago.

08:47:19.400 --> 08:47:21.400
I don't see it.

08:47:21.400 --> 08:47:23.400
You're not the only one to say

08:47:23.400 --> 08:47:25.400
that you've sent a thingy, but it's not came

08:47:25.400 --> 08:47:27.400
through. I don't know why.

08:47:27.400 --> 08:47:29.400
The last one I see

08:47:29.400 --> 08:47:31.400
is from TinySpiny.

08:47:31.400 --> 08:47:33.400
It says I've returned from the job.

08:47:35.400 --> 08:47:37.400
Wait, did it actually not go through?

08:47:37.400 --> 08:47:39.400
I don't want you to don't know if it's not

08:47:39.400 --> 08:47:41.400
showing up, seriously, though.

08:47:41.400 --> 08:47:43.400
Like, if it's not showing up, don't.

08:47:43.400 --> 08:47:45.400
Um...

08:47:45.400 --> 08:47:47.400
What was going on?

08:47:47.400 --> 08:47:49.400
Where the heck?

08:47:49.400 --> 08:47:51.400
What were you not supposed to go on?

08:47:51.400 --> 08:47:53.400
Can I just fly through that?

08:47:53.400 --> 08:47:55.400
Oh, no, I have to fly through the gap.

08:47:55.400 --> 08:47:57.400
I can already tell.

08:47:57.400 --> 08:47:59.400
The last commander

08:47:59.400 --> 08:48:01.400
sends promising.

08:48:01.400 --> 08:48:03.400
I f***ing hope so.

08:48:03.400 --> 08:48:05.400
The RDA said

08:48:05.400 --> 08:48:07.400
it's been an experience,

08:48:07.400 --> 08:48:09.400
but I'm not sure

08:48:09.400 --> 08:48:11.400
it's been one for...

08:48:11.400 --> 08:48:13.400
Yeah, okay.

08:48:13.400 --> 08:48:15.400
Yeah, yeah.

08:48:17.400 --> 08:48:19.400
Let's just break through the rocks, don't mind me.

08:48:19.400 --> 08:48:21.400
Don't worry, mom's happy to support my local calm fish.

08:48:23.400 --> 08:48:25.400
I know I wouldn't display though.

08:48:25.400 --> 08:48:27.400
Where am I going?

08:48:27.400 --> 08:48:29.400
Just a little to the right.

08:48:29.400 --> 08:48:31.400
Oh, my goodness, Bolly.

08:48:31.400 --> 08:48:33.400
Okay, there's the helipad

08:48:33.400 --> 08:48:35.400
that I'm supposed to land on.

08:48:35.400 --> 08:48:37.400
Make it nice and easy for me.

08:48:37.400 --> 08:48:39.400
Oop, oop. A little cheeky crash land in there,

08:48:39.400 --> 08:48:41.400
don't mind me.

08:48:41.400 --> 08:48:43.400
Is this not it?

08:48:45.400 --> 08:48:47.400
Looks like it.

08:48:47.400 --> 08:48:49.400
At least when it's over, you can see

08:48:49.400 --> 08:48:51.400
you've finally completed the game.

08:48:51.400 --> 08:48:53.400
Honestly, it's been fun,

08:48:53.400 --> 08:48:55.400
but there's a reason my Tism

08:48:55.400 --> 08:48:57.400
didn't attach on this game too much

08:48:57.400 --> 08:48:59.400
because there's quite a few things like that.

08:48:59.400 --> 08:49:01.400
That was killing me.

08:49:01.400 --> 08:49:03.400
Hey, last one.

08:49:05.400 --> 08:49:07.400
Oh.

08:49:11.400 --> 08:49:13.400
The only reason I could even win that

08:49:13.400 --> 08:49:15.400
last fight is because I managed

08:49:15.400 --> 08:49:17.400
to cheat that Thanotaur.

08:49:17.400 --> 08:49:19.400
I can't imagine if I would even get past that

08:49:19.400 --> 08:49:21.400
if that Thanotaur didn't get caught in the road.

08:49:21.400 --> 08:49:23.400
I'm sorry.

08:49:23.400 --> 08:49:25.400
I said that wrong.

08:49:27.400 --> 08:49:29.400
Oh.

08:49:31.400 --> 08:49:33.400
Am I allowed to slide to get there?

08:49:33.400 --> 08:49:35.400
Or is it a mix?

08:49:35.400 --> 08:49:37.400
If I give a mix, I'll take a mix

08:49:37.400 --> 08:49:39.400
if it's giving me a mix.

08:49:39.400 --> 08:49:41.400
Then you can play the domination minigame.

08:49:41.400 --> 08:49:43.400
I like on the Navi side.

08:49:43.400 --> 08:49:45.400
I've never played it on this side.

08:49:49.400 --> 08:49:51.400
Alrighty.

08:49:51.400 --> 08:49:53.400
If I take a right, then everything

08:49:53.400 --> 08:49:55.400
shall be alright.

08:49:55.400 --> 08:49:57.400
Let's hope this last one.

08:49:57.400 --> 08:49:59.400
Strony, you seem sleepy.

08:49:59.400 --> 08:50:01.400
I hope you're having fun.

08:50:01.400 --> 08:50:03.400
Yeah, I'm having fun. I know I sound like

08:50:03.400 --> 08:50:05.400
that's if I punch.

08:50:05.400 --> 08:50:07.400
I'm getting spawned

08:50:07.400 --> 08:50:09.400
by a freaking plant.

08:50:09.400 --> 08:50:11.400
I'm enjoying it.

08:50:11.400 --> 08:50:13.400
It's just because I've never played it before

08:50:13.400 --> 08:50:15.400
and

08:50:15.400 --> 08:50:17.400
I just did not expect

08:50:17.400 --> 08:50:19.400
at all how unbelievably hard it was.

08:50:19.400 --> 08:50:21.400
For example, there's RDA soldiers

08:50:21.400 --> 08:50:23.400
literally getting

08:50:23.400 --> 08:50:25.400
messed up by these

08:50:25.400 --> 08:50:27.400
plants and they're just letting it

08:50:27.400 --> 08:50:29.400
happen and it's just like

08:50:29.400 --> 08:50:31.400
I had no idea they would make it

08:50:31.400 --> 08:50:33.400
so hard if I was going to be...

08:50:33.400 --> 08:50:35.400
Because the Navi side, honestly, you can just ignore

08:50:35.400 --> 08:50:37.400
everything, but when you're a wee

08:50:37.400 --> 08:50:39.400
human, you actually can't ignore

08:50:39.400 --> 08:50:41.400
everything or else you're like a big doo-doo.

08:50:43.400 --> 08:50:45.400
I mean, it's not that easy.

08:50:45.400 --> 08:50:47.400
It really is.

08:50:53.400 --> 08:50:55.400
I'm hoping I do

08:50:55.400 --> 08:50:57.400
get a good night's sleep soon because

08:50:57.400 --> 08:50:59.400
it's really hard to be creative and do

08:50:59.400 --> 08:51:01.400
ASMR collabs like coming up with scripts

08:51:01.400 --> 08:51:03.400
when I've literally got like no thoughts

08:51:03.400 --> 08:51:05.400
of doing ASMR collabs.

08:51:13.400 --> 08:51:15.400
I'm actually going to

08:51:15.400 --> 08:51:17.400
pick that up because

08:51:17.400 --> 08:51:19.400
they're too valuable.

08:51:19.400 --> 08:51:21.400
Wait, I can't even go up one more.

08:51:23.400 --> 08:51:25.400
Okay, I need to climb like one foot.

08:51:27.400 --> 08:51:29.400
RDA side to real

08:51:29.400 --> 08:51:31.400
sad. I hope you're doing a good night's

08:51:31.400 --> 08:51:33.400
sleep. Yeah, I'm like

08:51:33.400 --> 08:51:35.400
I've not had a decent

08:51:35.400 --> 08:51:37.400
one in quite a while. Oh my

08:51:37.400 --> 08:51:39.400
god, there's so many of them.

08:51:39.400 --> 08:51:41.400
Okay, that was good. I like

08:51:41.400 --> 08:51:43.400
that. I think it's heritage that fast

08:51:43.400 --> 08:51:45.400
like all the time, that'd be great.

08:51:47.400 --> 08:51:49.400
Oh, see, when it

08:51:49.400 --> 08:51:51.400
miss...

08:51:51.400 --> 08:51:53.400
When it misses, it really

08:51:53.400 --> 08:51:55.400
bothers me.

08:51:57.400 --> 08:51:59.400
Oh, I'm just going to biz. I don't know.

08:51:59.400 --> 08:52:01.400
There's enemies everywhere.

08:52:05.400 --> 08:52:07.400
Oh, I can hear one right behind me.

08:52:07.400 --> 08:52:09.400
I'm going to try and claim this before

08:52:09.400 --> 08:52:11.400
default. Get some rest.

08:52:11.400 --> 08:52:13.400
I will get some good rest. I don't know

08:52:13.400 --> 08:52:15.400
what my stream is tomorrow. I can't remember.

08:52:15.400 --> 08:52:17.400
Is it ASMR?

08:52:19.400 --> 08:52:21.400
Or is that a small game?

08:52:23.400 --> 08:52:25.400
I think it goes ASMR

08:52:25.400 --> 08:52:27.400
sweets.

08:52:27.400 --> 08:52:29.400
Oh, this is a boss fight.

08:52:29.400 --> 08:52:31.400
Yeah, I'm already getting ruled. Oh, I'm already

08:52:31.400 --> 08:52:33.400
getting ruled by boss. Okay,

08:52:33.400 --> 08:52:35.400
this is what I can't stand.

08:52:35.400 --> 08:52:37.400
I'm about to go do a boss fight

08:52:37.400 --> 08:52:39.400
and there's like a billion rub.

08:52:39.400 --> 08:52:41.400
Nah, nah, come on,

08:52:41.400 --> 08:52:43.400
mate.

08:52:43.400 --> 08:52:45.400
Yeah, this is getting

08:52:45.400 --> 08:52:47.400
ridiculous.

08:52:47.400 --> 08:52:49.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:52:49.400 --> 08:52:51.400
Thank goodness I was picking up my RDA

08:52:51.400 --> 08:52:53.400
things.

08:52:53.400 --> 08:52:55.400
Whoa.

08:52:57.400 --> 08:52:59.400
No, no, you're so dead.

08:52:59.400 --> 08:53:01.400
Get that.

08:53:01.400 --> 08:53:03.400
Right, a spell of protection, spell

08:53:03.400 --> 08:53:05.400
of invincibility, because

08:53:05.400 --> 08:53:07.400
what the actual

08:53:09.400 --> 08:53:11.400
bro, you're going to need to let

08:53:11.400 --> 08:53:13.400
I'm dead

08:53:15.400 --> 08:53:17.400
I need a breather.

08:53:19.400 --> 08:53:21.400
I literally need a health breather.

08:53:21.400 --> 08:53:23.400
The AI can

08:53:23.400 --> 08:53:25.400
freaking see me.

08:53:25.400 --> 08:53:27.400
Mm-hmm.

08:53:27.400 --> 08:53:29.400
Yeah.

08:53:29.400 --> 08:53:31.400
She literally won't go down

08:53:31.400 --> 08:53:33.400
because she keeps activating all of her abilities.

08:53:33.400 --> 08:53:35.400
This is ridiculous.

08:53:39.400 --> 08:53:41.400
Right, so they're

08:53:43.400 --> 08:53:45.400
Okay.

08:53:47.400 --> 08:53:49.400
Bro, you're just stun-locking me.

08:53:51.400 --> 08:53:53.400
I literally can't get close enough.

08:53:55.400 --> 08:53:57.400
Yeah, how do you

08:53:57.400 --> 08:53:59.400
like being fucking stun-locked?

08:53:59.400 --> 08:54:01.400
Oh, fuck!

08:54:01.400 --> 08:54:03.400
Just infinite

08:54:03.400 --> 08:54:05.400
spawn after

08:54:05.400 --> 08:54:07.400
spot, so get the fucking moab out, honestly.

08:54:07.400 --> 08:54:09.400
What the

08:54:09.400 --> 08:54:11.400
fucking is this shit, honestly?

08:54:17.400 --> 08:54:19.400
Uh, have I activated it?

08:54:19.400 --> 08:54:21.400
Hello? Stun it?

08:54:25.400 --> 08:54:27.400
Lovely.

08:54:27.400 --> 08:54:29.400
Mm, let me analize.

08:54:29.400 --> 08:54:31.400
That did a sweet fuck all.

08:54:31.400 --> 08:54:33.400
Right, lovely, lovely.

08:54:33.400 --> 08:54:35.400
Don't ever show your fucking hideous face again.

08:54:35.400 --> 08:54:37.400
That was what bloody waste that was.

08:54:37.400 --> 08:54:39.400
Uh, right, that's the best I got.

08:54:39.400 --> 08:54:41.400
Berserk.

08:54:41.400 --> 08:54:43.400
Berserk's literally the best I got.

08:54:43.400 --> 08:54:45.400
And I get

08:54:45.400 --> 08:54:47.400
stunned the moment I use it.

08:54:51.400 --> 08:54:53.400
Bro, I need to put

08:54:53.400 --> 08:54:55.400
I need to put a little invisible on

08:54:55.400 --> 08:54:57.400
so I can literally heal in time.

08:54:57.400 --> 08:54:59.400
Yeah.

08:54:59.400 --> 08:55:01.400
And get stunned the millisecond.

08:55:05.400 --> 08:55:07.400
This is why

08:55:07.400 --> 08:55:09.400
I don't play read games on stream

08:55:09.400 --> 08:55:11.400
because I literally can't even handle a normal game.

08:55:13.400 --> 08:55:15.400
Yeah, and then invisible again,

08:55:15.400 --> 08:55:17.400
so I can't get them the entire time they're shooting at me

08:55:17.400 --> 08:55:19.400
and then stun, and stun, and stun,

08:55:19.400 --> 08:55:21.400
and stun, and stun, and stun.

08:55:21.400 --> 08:55:23.400
Okay, we get it, we get it, we get it, we get it, we get it.

08:55:23.400 --> 08:55:25.400
Stun. We love a good stun, we'll

08:55:25.400 --> 08:55:27.400
yep, and then, yep,

08:55:27.400 --> 08:55:29.400
and then into stun, right, what their ability

08:55:29.400 --> 08:55:31.400
you literally just used

08:55:31.400 --> 08:55:33.400
that one so you don't even have a cooldown

08:55:33.400 --> 08:55:35.400
at all. Oh, and then

08:55:35.400 --> 08:55:37.400
in comes your buddies, in comes

08:55:37.400 --> 08:55:39.400
yeah, and then your buddy uses their ability

08:55:39.400 --> 08:55:41.400
and then I'm a way

08:55:41.400 --> 08:55:43.400
wasting ammo yet again

08:55:43.400 --> 08:55:45.400
on not the freaking boss.

08:55:47.400 --> 08:55:49.400
You're gonna need to get a break,

08:55:49.400 --> 08:55:51.400
so you're gonna need, again, a straight to ability

08:55:51.400 --> 08:55:53.400
can't, need to wait, need to wait.

08:55:57.400 --> 08:55:59.400
Again, straight to ability,

08:55:59.400 --> 08:56:01.400
fucking infinite buddy.

08:56:01.400 --> 08:56:03.400
Yep, and then they get, no, oh,

08:56:03.400 --> 08:56:05.400
a Christmas miracle, I actually got a fucking thing from it.

08:56:09.400 --> 08:56:11.400
Oh, and your pal's already back.

08:56:11.400 --> 08:56:13.400
I've not even been away for like a millisecond.

08:56:13.400 --> 08:56:15.400
I'm gonna have to go into this fucking

08:56:15.400 --> 08:56:17.400
do this, right, at least I've reloaded,

08:56:17.400 --> 08:56:19.400
but, yeah,

08:56:19.400 --> 08:56:21.400
and I'm already getting spanked.

08:56:21.400 --> 08:56:23.400
I don't even know where the fucking enemy

08:56:23.400 --> 08:56:25.400
that I'm supposed to be killing is.

08:56:25.400 --> 08:56:27.400
Oh, and straight to the ability.

08:56:27.400 --> 08:56:29.400
Oh, classic.

08:56:29.400 --> 08:56:31.400
Oh, more of your pal's!

08:56:33.400 --> 08:56:35.400
There's nothing I can do, there's

08:56:35.400 --> 08:56:37.400
literally nothing I can do other than

08:56:37.400 --> 08:56:39.400
tick damage, like this is

08:56:39.400 --> 08:56:41.400
just the tiniest

08:56:41.400 --> 08:56:43.400
amount of damage that can be dealt

08:56:43.400 --> 08:56:45.400
at any moment, and it just

08:56:45.400 --> 08:56:47.400
over and over again!

08:56:49.400 --> 08:56:51.400
Literally playing this game over and over again.

08:56:51.400 --> 08:56:53.400
One hit, get nothing more,

08:56:53.400 --> 08:56:55.400
have to heal, get nothing more.

08:56:55.400 --> 08:56:57.400
Just fucking

08:56:57.400 --> 08:56:59.400
perish off, fucking

08:56:59.400 --> 08:57:01.400
map!

08:57:01.400 --> 08:57:03.400
Uh, I'm dead, I'm actually dead.

08:57:03.400 --> 08:57:05.400
I don't have a

08:57:05.400 --> 08:57:07.400
Enviz, and I don't have a heal.

08:57:11.400 --> 08:57:13.400
I don't know what you want me to do.

08:57:15.400 --> 08:57:17.400
Who made this, Ubisoft?

08:57:19.400 --> 08:57:21.400
How many game di- how many fucking

08:57:21.400 --> 08:57:23.400
playtesters have you got? Like, one max,

08:57:23.400 --> 08:57:25.400
maybe? Do you share one for, like, one fucking

08:57:25.400 --> 08:57:27.400
region? One for whole of Oceanic,

08:57:27.400 --> 08:57:29.400
one for whole of Bloody Europe, one for whole of

08:57:29.400 --> 08:57:31.400
fucking America? Like, what's going on?

08:57:31.400 --> 08:57:33.400
None of you's playtested this, not one person.

08:57:33.400 --> 08:57:35.400
Not one person!

08:57:37.400 --> 08:57:39.400
Oh, let me just analyze

08:57:39.400 --> 08:57:41.400
and see if this is there, this seems fair.

08:57:41.400 --> 08:57:43.400
Mmm... Right, let's uh, let's do

08:57:43.400 --> 08:57:45.400
infinite spawning. Uh, let's make sure

08:57:45.400 --> 08:57:47.400
you get stun lot, right. Okay,

08:57:47.400 --> 08:57:49.400
mmm, right. Alright, let's do it, let's do it,

08:57:49.400 --> 08:57:51.400
let's do it! Let's do it, Cheeky Gangbang!

08:57:51.400 --> 08:57:53.400
Oh my god,

08:57:53.400 --> 08:57:55.400
let's just do it, Cheeky Gangbang, and make

08:57:55.400 --> 08:57:57.400
sure that the enemies, enemies are allowed to

08:57:57.400 --> 08:57:59.400
infinite heal. It's fine, enemies

08:57:59.400 --> 08:58:01.400
can infinite heal, enemies can infinite

08:58:01.400 --> 08:58:03.400
fucking use their abilities, all the fucking thing!

08:58:03.400 --> 08:58:05.400
And as soon as you give them a

08:58:05.400 --> 08:58:07.400
Sanamir! Off of their HP bar!

08:58:07.400 --> 08:58:14.520
HP bar. Oh, let's just make sure they just give them everything all at once infinite fucking mana. Oh

08:58:14.840 --> 08:58:16.840
my god

08:58:16.840 --> 08:58:22.780
Just let it be over with just let it happen. Oh my god

08:58:25.680 --> 08:58:27.680
Like I literally need to go invisible

08:58:30.520 --> 08:58:33.520
Oh my god, just let it be over

08:58:34.840 --> 08:58:36.840
Just let it be over

08:58:37.400 --> 08:58:43.480
Again, yeah instant stun lock as soon as you shit. I don't even have that ability is Navi when I play Navi

08:58:43.480 --> 08:58:45.480
I don't even have this ability

08:58:46.480 --> 08:58:51.240
Just instant fucking lock over and over and and your pals are back

08:58:54.280 --> 08:58:59.280
Mate I would absolutely love to have a whole fucking trade behind me, but I've no bloody got that extension have a

08:59:07.400 --> 08:59:09.400
I

08:59:32.280 --> 08:59:34.280
Best I can do

08:59:37.400 --> 08:59:39.400
I

08:59:40.680 --> 08:59:43.120
Hundred got a hundred shotgun shells was now enough

08:59:44.360 --> 08:59:46.360
Now you go get more

08:59:47.320 --> 08:59:49.320
Cuz it was now of course it was down off. Oh

08:59:52.560 --> 08:59:54.880
No, it's fine. No, it's fine. I didn't want to

08:59:59.960 --> 09:00:01.960
Yeah, no, it's fine I

09:00:02.240 --> 09:00:04.240
I

09:00:04.600 --> 09:00:06.600
Love being absolutely incapacitated

09:00:13.320 --> 09:00:16.320
I love it you should do it more actually

09:00:16.800 --> 09:00:21.520
How about you just spawn eight NPCs all fucking ones at one time? Oh my fucking god

09:00:23.160 --> 09:00:25.160
Fucking RDA fan is honestly

09:00:25.680 --> 09:00:31.000
Oh, and I'm probably gonna die jumping off this cliff looking me just to really fucking ace it on the cake

09:00:31.000 --> 09:00:33.400
They just I actually can't he stop it. They actually

09:00:37.080 --> 09:00:39.080
Yeah

09:00:41.840 --> 09:00:44.880
Yep, and all aimed even though in this

09:00:46.080 --> 09:00:48.520
Continue probably not even be able to heal in time and I get to die

09:00:49.400 --> 09:00:52.960
Cuz I only have one fucking RDA element to my fucking name

09:00:58.200 --> 09:00:59.880
Yeah

09:00:59.880 --> 09:01:04.840
This better be the last mission. I am like fucking correct right now. I

09:01:05.920 --> 09:01:08.600
Really hope like I severely hope this is the last mission

09:01:10.960 --> 09:01:13.840
Instant damage to the mech not even in the body sign

09:01:15.880 --> 09:01:20.200
For the cheeky gang bang party parrot party parrot party parrot

09:01:22.040 --> 09:01:25.280
It's never fucking end and vote was it vault

09:01:25.800 --> 09:01:37.800
Volcan thank you for the tip. It's never ending. There is no way that was appropriately play tested unless I'm missing like

09:01:38.440 --> 09:01:46.600
Some major notes, and I missed a massive patch that came out for this game in 2009 that there's no way

09:01:47.160 --> 09:01:51.880
That is the gameplay and then the dev team happy with that gameplay

09:01:52.560 --> 09:01:53.560
I

09:01:53.560 --> 09:01:56.800
Refused to accept that that even got passed

09:01:59.520 --> 09:02:02.000
Absolutely refused to accept that I got past I

09:02:04.520 --> 09:02:11.320
Don't think anyone got this far in the place. I think I completely agree with that statement cuz what on earth was that?

09:02:12.960 --> 09:02:17.360
Literally, I don't have an ability when I play Navi if I get hit I have a massive fucking throbbing

09:02:17.640 --> 09:02:23.000
Fucking pulse coming from a bloody groin. No, I don't want to teleport. I want to talk to the man

09:02:23.000 --> 09:02:25.000
That's right right in there

09:02:26.240 --> 09:02:28.240
Please let it be over

09:02:34.200 --> 09:02:36.200
Let it be over

09:02:36.800 --> 09:02:38.800
Let it be over. Yeah, I'm not

09:02:42.680 --> 09:02:44.680
Let it be over

09:02:47.400 --> 09:02:49.400
Yeah, that Moab did absolutely

09:02:50.120 --> 09:02:52.120
the point of that was

09:02:53.040 --> 09:02:57.800
Let it be over. Let it be over. Let it be over. Let it be over. Let it be over. Let it be over. Let it be over

09:02:59.960 --> 09:03:01.960
Thanks for borrowing a condom

09:03:05.960 --> 09:03:11.880
This game was pretty bad pretty fast after lunch. Thanks to the game getting canned hard in the reviews and took their money around

09:03:11.880 --> 09:03:16.240
I mean they made them if they got two points living million sales. Yeah

09:03:17.600 --> 09:03:19.600
So don't screw up

09:03:19.880 --> 09:03:23.280
Yes, sir. Thank you. You can kiss over there

09:03:24.160 --> 09:03:30.600
You so much you put a scratch there there last at least the section span over you mean that wasn't the last section

09:03:30.600 --> 09:03:33.000
Are you implying there's more to this fucking thing?

09:03:33.440 --> 09:03:36.600
Or just ordered you to board a dragon to fly to some location

09:03:37.480 --> 09:03:40.800
This is why mommy likes me hold her hand. Yes. This is why I like

09:03:41.800 --> 09:03:43.800
This is awful

09:03:45.520 --> 09:03:50.520
You're still streaming. Oh, you just missed the part where I screamed down the make so yeah, oh

09:03:54.600 --> 09:03:56.600
Please let me go off this road

09:03:57.040 --> 09:04:03.820
Why does the conductor keep putting me on? Well, I did they keep creating more and more sections of this fucking site of the map

09:04:04.660 --> 09:04:13.580
Okay, this is it. This is it the map looks like this is it. There's nothing more of the matter

09:04:17.740 --> 09:04:23.180
Well, we all pretended that you finished the game and you can go risk. No, this is it

09:04:23.780 --> 09:04:29.240
Look at the map. There's no way this map is a fetch quest because look at the state of it. There's not an owner. Oh

09:04:29.520 --> 09:04:31.520
Oh

09:04:31.800 --> 09:04:33.800
Did I get to drive this at least?

09:04:35.320 --> 09:04:37.320
It's over

09:04:40.640 --> 09:04:43.640
Oh, how do I fly this? Oh fuck me, man. Oh

09:04:45.920 --> 09:04:48.620
No, oh no, I don't like that. Oh, no

09:04:51.520 --> 09:04:58.000
Right, okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, huh. Oh, yeah, I can fly I can fly

09:04:59.560 --> 09:05:03.280
Call me Peter Pan because you can fly you can fly you can fly

09:05:06.080 --> 09:05:09.520
Okay, take it easy easy on the corners easy

09:05:10.640 --> 09:05:17.260
Pandora is a little wild for the road bumps and by road bumps the full mass of us

09:05:21.000 --> 09:05:23.000
You can shoot the rocks

09:05:23.000 --> 09:05:25.000
Oh

09:05:27.840 --> 09:05:29.840
That makes them

09:05:31.920 --> 09:05:33.920
Wait, I'm gonna run out of missiles

09:05:38.040 --> 09:05:40.040
Okay

09:05:42.040 --> 09:05:47.680
That was a very successful drive, I think I don't think I actually bumped into one thing

09:05:49.840 --> 09:05:51.840
Easy easy

09:05:53.000 --> 09:05:55.000
Oh

09:05:55.040 --> 09:05:56.040
actual

09:05:56.040 --> 09:05:58.040
Best landing ever

09:06:00.640 --> 09:06:04.720
Okay, there are wolves, but that's fine. Nothing I can't handle. Oh

09:06:06.440 --> 09:06:09.880
I can't do my little flip in the water. Do a flip

09:06:12.280 --> 09:06:14.280
What kind of sadistic

09:06:15.000 --> 09:06:18.000
Made to say you should be able to run out of missiles

09:06:18.000 --> 09:06:25.680
Honestly, it does seem a bit like that flight thing that flying dragon is massive and you're telling me they can't hold more than like 20 muscles. Oh

09:06:27.480 --> 09:06:34.520
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Why are you holding that piece of paper? Oh, oh

09:06:34.520 --> 09:06:36.520
Oh

09:06:46.400 --> 09:06:48.400
What's the plan

09:06:55.640 --> 09:06:58.000
I'm gonna I'm gonna put down TNT

09:06:59.000 --> 09:07:07.000
As long as there's no boss fight, I couldn't be less of a rat's horse what fetch quest you send me on name your boss fights

09:07:08.320 --> 09:07:11.360
What is this? What is this armor?

09:07:13.480 --> 09:07:17.240
Protection down but everything else up. I think I'd rather protection up

09:07:19.080 --> 09:07:21.080
Just leave it leave it

09:07:21.600 --> 09:07:23.600
What's this right? What's the deal?

09:07:23.960 --> 09:07:25.960
Oh

09:07:27.960 --> 09:07:32.240
As long as there's no boss fight on the other side, I couldn't give a rise of a rat's

09:07:37.640 --> 09:07:41.520
I'm not keep tolerating any anymore

09:07:43.920 --> 09:07:48.360
If the goal was to make the count in pain memorable, they should be sure succeeded

09:07:48.360 --> 09:07:50.840
Oh, I'd say more like miserable because

09:07:51.760 --> 09:07:56.640
Again, like literally the Navi instantly do that as soon as you injure them. They do their thing

09:07:58.440 --> 09:08:00.440
Except that one I guess

09:08:01.920 --> 09:08:05.640
Let's just let's navigate we're appropriate

09:08:08.960 --> 09:08:10.960
I don't know if I should just speedrun it

09:08:12.480 --> 09:08:17.320
Can the mech even go on the bridge that's up ahead it feels like a bridge on my hood and my wee minimap

09:08:19.200 --> 09:08:21.200
Oh

09:08:22.520 --> 09:08:28.760
Like this game parish definitely, yeah, thanks for that really appreciate that

09:08:31.280 --> 09:08:35.680
Why am I being shot I'm being chased I'm being chased

09:08:35.680 --> 09:08:37.680
Oh

09:08:42.320 --> 09:08:47.680
Yeah, definitely happy to replay that's true brotherhood not happy to replay

09:08:50.800 --> 09:08:54.960
The Navi say yay fun the RDA say oh my god

09:08:56.880 --> 09:09:02.960
I think I've almost got two revives, but I don't think I have a boss fight anymore. I think this is literally just

09:09:03.600 --> 09:09:05.600
Spring pray from here on out

09:09:16.160 --> 09:09:18.160
Accuracy rubbish. Oh

09:09:26.560 --> 09:09:31.400
Oh, that's a lot of Navi and they're probably gonna destroy my myth. Oh, I'm not careful

09:09:33.200 --> 09:09:35.200
Where's BT when you need them

09:09:49.360 --> 09:09:53.600
I just want a few revives on hand. All right, I've got two revives now

09:09:54.760 --> 09:09:58.360
As long as I can choose a hate thing if there's a fight ahead. I

09:09:58.840 --> 09:10:00.840
Just hope this. Oh my god my mix

09:10:01.760 --> 09:10:03.760
Well, look at me

09:10:08.720 --> 09:10:15.320
Right just got keep going just looks like there's fates all the way up ahead. We need BT on

09:10:17.640 --> 09:10:22.320
Honestly sorry for reason idea of RDA, but thank you for experience in it

09:10:23.200 --> 09:10:28.600
Thank you for experiencing the pain. I mean some people enjoy when streamers rage. I don't know

09:10:31.160 --> 09:10:36.560
I got taken out in viz for that like some people genuinely love when streamers rage and I'm like

09:10:38.160 --> 09:10:44.160
Hold off the Navi. No, you are not gonna make them literally

09:10:49.080 --> 09:10:55.280
Um, I don't know how freaking strong you think I am I am not that good. I that's

09:10:56.240 --> 09:11:00.320
Okay, I'm gonna try and keep a lid on it and not get overwhelmed

09:11:00.840 --> 09:11:04.440
Very quickly. I am so glad I picked up the other RDA

09:11:08.640 --> 09:11:10.640
I can't do anything

09:11:18.160 --> 09:11:20.160
Yeah, I'm gonna need you guys

09:11:24.040 --> 09:11:29.480
Hmm, I'm gonna need everyone to start spamming nades everywhere. I'm pretty sure those are RDA needs

09:11:29.480 --> 09:11:33.080
I'm gonna need everyone to do that unanimously unanimously right now

09:11:35.120 --> 09:11:37.920
It's not it's okay. Just sacrifice me in the fire

09:11:40.560 --> 09:11:46.040
Oh, and I'm taking out in viz, which is the only time it helps to we do my

09:11:49.560 --> 09:11:51.560
Uh-huh

09:11:52.160 --> 09:11:57.240
Okay, feel and then damage protection to how I can get my heel back up

09:11:59.600 --> 09:12:01.600
I need long range

09:12:07.440 --> 09:12:12.400
Okay, those are definitely our needs I feel like if the Navi were doing needs like that, I'd be a goner already

09:12:13.680 --> 09:12:16.360
Okay, okay, we're not over run

09:12:20.480 --> 09:12:27.080
But don't want to jinx it but I'm gonna grab that it's really important

09:12:29.480 --> 09:12:33.960
I'm gonna jinx it but it's looking good only a minute 30 of this and then we're done

09:12:39.600 --> 09:12:41.600
Okay

09:12:42.360 --> 09:12:45.120
But protection on I don't really want to miss me too much

09:12:51.040 --> 09:12:53.040
I'll take that

09:12:53.800 --> 09:12:55.800
I'm cool. I'm

09:12:56.800 --> 09:13:00.480
Okay, I don't know if we're spamming needs, but keep doing that shit. Oh my god

09:13:01.120 --> 09:13:05.560
It's literally stun off in them from hitting us. Oh, that's a lot. That's a lot. Hold on

09:13:09.200 --> 09:13:11.200
Oh dear

09:13:11.600 --> 09:13:17.160
I think I think maybe some of our soldiers went down because we're getting now. Okay. Now we're over run again

09:13:19.840 --> 09:13:25.160
If I can just whittle down some base health on them, it just makes all the world of difference

09:13:26.440 --> 09:13:28.440
Oh

09:13:33.960 --> 09:13:37.560
We may actually have three roses. Oh, I'm getting some of my pardon

09:13:39.520 --> 09:13:46.320
I'm not that mad because I'm actually getting help like genuinely getting help and like they're not all all off and on to me

09:13:46.320 --> 09:13:50.120
It's when they all all off and there's like nothing I can do hold on. Sorry. I'm getting

09:13:50.440 --> 09:13:52.320
Because I'm too busy

09:13:52.320 --> 09:13:56.360
Praising the game for not being absolutely ridiculous. Oh, I take it back

09:14:04.000 --> 09:14:08.880
Why do you fill out your pistols every time why do you insist on fill it out the pistol?

09:14:09.760 --> 09:14:12.120
Well, I hope it didn't die because of that freaking cutscene

09:14:14.040 --> 09:14:19.560
Is mercy up by the way, I think mercy may be live. I may have completely missed it

09:14:22.320 --> 09:14:24.320
Oh

09:14:24.320 --> 09:14:26.320
Oh

09:14:26.320 --> 09:14:28.320
Oh

09:14:28.320 --> 09:14:30.320
Oh

09:14:50.240 --> 09:14:57.040
Okay, no, so they are still attacking whatever but I mean I'm getting left alone devices. I'll take it

09:14:58.320 --> 09:15:00.320
I

09:15:01.800 --> 09:15:08.940
Danger danger danger high voltage. Okay. Mercy is live. Yes, monster. Welcome to link her. We will redirect into her

09:15:08.940 --> 09:15:13.280
I think we're almost done. I am going for a nap after this stream. I can tell you that much

09:15:16.000 --> 09:15:18.000
Wow

09:15:18.000 --> 09:15:23.240
Mercy's region just yeah, if you're in it, I don't know you'll need to see who rage is more me or mercy. Oh

09:15:23.240 --> 09:15:25.240
I

09:15:28.760 --> 09:15:35.840
Can sense it I'm licking the screen right now almost done. Oh

09:15:41.920 --> 09:15:43.920
You need more than enough

09:15:45.960 --> 09:15:50.640
One read stream to the next return to your dragon flight the well souls. We've done it

09:15:51.640 --> 09:15:58.800
The evil has been defeated. I will never I'm very happy to say I will never play the RDA side again. Oh

09:16:00.280 --> 09:16:02.280
A rank rotten experience

09:16:04.280 --> 09:16:08.160
Dev team do not speak ever again and do not cook ever again

09:16:10.000 --> 09:16:13.480
Thank you and good night. That's my review

09:16:13.480 --> 09:16:15.480
Oh

09:16:18.360 --> 09:16:21.160
Forward a little to the right

09:16:24.720 --> 09:16:30.720
The game arrangement real I was just it was just rinse and repeat rinse and repeat in the moment

09:16:30.720 --> 09:16:36.360
I've got even a hint of damage a lick of damage to speed things up

09:16:36.920 --> 09:16:39.560
Either new guys were brought in

09:16:43.480 --> 09:16:45.480
Oh

09:16:48.760 --> 09:16:50.760
It's actually have a health bar just

09:16:53.760 --> 09:16:55.920
Taking these corners to Willy-nilly then

09:16:59.000 --> 09:17:03.840
Story show on your back. I can't help it. I know how it when you're angry. Oh my god. I feel like that would be terrifying

09:17:03.840 --> 09:17:05.840
I

09:17:09.480 --> 09:17:13.760
Make me in that peaky shrivel and go back and save me. I'm so happy terrible

09:17:14.600 --> 09:17:16.600
That follows on the receiving end of that

09:17:19.720 --> 09:17:22.320
Same here is kind of what no

09:17:24.280 --> 09:17:26.280
Sorry, sorry

09:17:26.520 --> 09:17:28.520
I

09:17:32.760 --> 09:17:37.720
Right we did it we have confirmed the evil

09:17:39.200 --> 09:17:43.280
Is the game gonna let us get there without being attacked by a plan

09:17:47.400 --> 09:17:54.080
No fighting here, or I'm gonna cry I'm gonna angry spot is more. I'm sorry so that terrifies mummy

09:17:56.800 --> 09:17:58.800
Oh

09:18:10.360 --> 09:18:12.440
Oh, I'm going

09:18:14.280 --> 09:18:15.720
Listen to you

09:18:15.720 --> 09:18:20.280
The new recruits fresh from earth. I've been working on this for over 10 years

09:18:20.280 --> 09:18:23.560
This is my moment right now. So if it doesn't work

09:18:24.360 --> 09:18:28.400
I'll see you on the other side. Oh wait, I have to I need to end him anyway. Oh

09:18:34.240 --> 09:18:38.200
Well, this is gonna be beautifully satisfying

09:18:41.400 --> 09:18:45.600
Just let me cook a bit. Okay, it's fine. He has ability to go out of but yeah

09:18:47.000 --> 09:18:51.800
All things considered actually, you know what I could probably put on that double aggression thing

09:18:53.560 --> 09:18:55.560
Reserve her. Yeah

09:18:58.600 --> 09:19:00.600
Okay, oh

09:19:02.120 --> 09:19:04.120
We healed up

09:19:05.360 --> 09:19:09.360
I'm not sure I can send it to you healing up. So don't do that again

09:19:13.560 --> 09:19:15.560
Okay, I kind of like some walking around

09:19:16.520 --> 09:19:22.960
He doesn't really seem to do anything it seems like he

09:19:39.840 --> 09:19:43.600
I'm just giving him it I'm just throwing everything I'm hold on a minute

09:19:46.440 --> 09:19:51.720
Oh, wow, so the sonic pulse is too far away none. Okay, he's still healed again

09:19:54.560 --> 09:19:59.400
Now sadly, I am going to run out of ammo doing this message

09:20:00.360 --> 09:20:03.080
So not really sure

09:20:07.960 --> 09:20:12.360
That's fine you're like to do that, but maybe don't heal again

09:20:15.560 --> 09:20:17.560
Um

09:20:22.040 --> 09:20:24.200
Am I supposed to do something special for this fight?

09:20:30.760 --> 09:20:37.240
I don't know when he'll get we get like five and then the game's like, okay, no more heals for you. Well, why did the aim do it?

09:20:37.480 --> 09:20:39.480
I

09:20:45.160 --> 09:20:51.960
Like a ammo station, there was one back there. I'm literally out

09:21:07.320 --> 09:21:09.320
Oh

09:21:13.400 --> 09:21:18.440
I'm not like mad at this fight or anything, but like bro you keep healing like there's nothing I can do

09:21:30.760 --> 09:21:32.760
Use my mortar strike on him

09:21:32.760 --> 09:21:34.760
Yeah

09:21:41.640 --> 09:21:43.640
Uh

09:21:48.280 --> 09:21:50.280
I did nothing to him

09:21:50.840 --> 09:21:52.840
Oh

09:21:59.720 --> 09:22:01.240
I'm a bit confused

09:22:01.240 --> 09:22:06.760
Sorry, I need to change out my weapons because they're all empty. So I can't the nail gun sure

09:22:08.200 --> 09:22:11.640
It's already full me and there's no point me getting flamethrowers or

09:22:14.040 --> 09:22:16.040
Um machine gun

09:22:16.360 --> 09:22:19.320
I don't know I can I can oh this one's different

09:22:24.120 --> 09:22:26.120
Okay, nail gun again

09:22:27.400 --> 09:22:29.400
I healed again

09:22:31.480 --> 09:22:34.920
I don't know if I'm supposed to call upon awa to do something

09:22:37.720 --> 09:22:41.560
The utility looks like I've left literally sneaking on I guess he's just a damage on

09:22:42.680 --> 09:22:44.680
Wait, just go to the glowing thing

09:22:45.400 --> 09:22:47.400
I think back here

09:22:47.800 --> 09:22:49.800
No

09:22:54.040 --> 09:22:56.040
Sorry, I'm brain

09:22:56.440 --> 09:22:59.000
I'm both brain dead. I'm bling bling thing

09:23:00.120 --> 09:23:01.960
I'm looking

09:23:01.960 --> 09:23:06.280
But yeah, I'm starting to think I'm needing to like call upon awa to like end him because

09:23:07.080 --> 09:23:12.760
I'm literally like swimming right now. Excuse me. I just wanted to go for a wee swim before I ended you

09:23:14.760 --> 09:23:17.000
I'm just going to go like up on awa. Oops. Sorry. I'm gonna drop

09:23:19.080 --> 09:23:21.080
Glowing

09:23:22.120 --> 09:23:26.680
Not here. No, I'm definitely not to climb awa right now glowing

09:23:31.800 --> 09:23:35.400
I thought that stick I mean that stick is glowing what the fuck it is

09:23:36.120 --> 09:23:38.120
I

09:23:42.280 --> 09:23:47.240
Morning de synchronization imminent honestly, can you bring him to the ledge?

09:23:51.240 --> 09:23:53.400
I feel like I'm supposed to do something here

09:23:59.320 --> 09:24:02.520
I think it's broke. Okay, so I watched a quick video and the guy

09:24:03.480 --> 09:24:07.400
Eases a green angel. Oh greening greening launcher. Okay

09:24:10.520 --> 09:24:15.080
Is this a grenade launcher? I only have 20 on the grenade

09:24:18.520 --> 09:24:20.520
Oh

09:24:21.640 --> 09:24:27.720
Oh, wow, really? Okay after all of that, bro

09:24:27.880 --> 09:24:34.920
I'm starting to think this shit wasn't playtested at all past this point

09:24:54.120 --> 09:24:56.120
Are we the baddies?

09:24:58.520 --> 09:25:00.520
Oh

09:25:07.240 --> 09:25:09.240
Yeah, let's see where the baddies all right

09:25:12.920 --> 09:25:14.920
Rider you there colonel quarch

09:25:15.400 --> 09:25:19.960
Panelists is going like a baseball stadium. What the hell did you do? I'm not sure

09:25:20.200 --> 09:25:26.520
Whatever you did it worked the navi are making a quick retreat. I'm getting reports. They lost control of their band sheets

09:25:26.760 --> 09:25:28.760
That makes sense to you. Yeah

09:25:28.840 --> 09:25:30.200
It actually does

09:25:30.200 --> 09:25:32.600
Congrats rider. You're gonna be a hero for this

09:25:33.240 --> 09:25:37.800
I'll get your butt down here and that dragon better be spotless. You had damage on the dragon

09:25:38.920 --> 09:25:40.920
Eat

09:25:41.240 --> 09:25:44.920
I heard we lost Kendra, but you need to know you did the right thing

09:25:45.640 --> 09:25:47.640
I hope it was all right

09:25:47.960 --> 09:25:51.080
This better bring peace. You've stopped a catastrophe, but this isn't over

09:25:51.720 --> 09:25:56.440
We can't keep control available for long nor should we and we've got more shit

09:25:56.600 --> 09:25:58.600
of humans do to arrive

09:25:58.920 --> 09:26:01.240
More is inevitable. So what was this all for?

09:26:01.880 --> 09:26:06.440
A we needed to see what we're taking over. Not there being part two spoilers from the movie in the video game

09:26:06.840 --> 09:26:08.840
Next time she'll be ready

09:26:10.920 --> 09:26:12.920
Am I here?

09:26:16.600 --> 09:26:19.960
Development team should be ashamed of yourself for the rda side

09:26:20.520 --> 09:26:25.960
Development team should be proud of yourselves from the navi side. Don't ever make me do that again. That's awful

09:26:27.480 --> 09:26:29.480
Oh my god

09:26:30.920 --> 09:26:34.280
I have no idea how hard I reached because I can't remember in the moment

09:26:35.240 --> 09:26:37.240
But oh my god

09:26:38.760 --> 09:26:41.480
Am I going mental or was that terrible?

09:26:43.560 --> 09:26:48.760
I think I must have I think I should have been using the grenade launcher clearly from that last fight

09:26:49.320 --> 09:26:52.040
And and because I didn't use the grenade launcher

09:26:53.160 --> 09:26:54.840
and

09:26:54.920 --> 09:26:57.720
It just got from like bad to worse or

09:26:58.440 --> 09:27:03.160
You blacked out when you raised. I don't remember really what I just remember like I did get angry

09:27:03.800 --> 09:27:06.360
But I don't remember anything that actually happened like

09:27:06.840 --> 09:27:12.920
One minute I was like getting annoyed and then the next minute the fight was over and I got stuck on a rock and I was trying to get down

09:27:15.960 --> 09:27:20.200
I think grenade launcher is op. Okay, I guess that's probably you're showing quite a bit

09:27:21.000 --> 09:27:23.000
I'm cheeky gang bang

09:27:23.400 --> 09:27:29.960
She literally saw red. Honestly. It was beautiful. Monka is you're rage is hot, but the mission was bad

09:27:31.720 --> 09:27:37.720
Angry girl, you were fuming at the man. I was frothing for a moment. I clipped it. So show up one stream and it's Monka

09:27:37.720 --> 09:27:42.280
I don't even know am I going to be embarrassed if I look back on it like I don't feel that bad right now

09:27:42.360 --> 09:27:44.360
So kind of been that bad

09:27:45.320 --> 09:27:51.080
The game got dunked on hard and forgotten pretty quickly, but for the general community for a lot of good reasons

09:27:53.400 --> 09:27:57.960
At least you finished it. You deserve a good rest. Good girl. I'm proud of you for not giving up

09:27:58.360 --> 09:28:05.080
The rage has talked to your content. Well, that is literally why I do not play rage games like mercies unironically so brave

09:28:05.720 --> 09:28:09.320
For playing that game. Like I couldn't I'd just be scurriman

09:28:10.280 --> 09:28:15.960
It may be a bit embarrassing, but at least it seems to have been for a good reason. I felt that rage. It's so funny

09:28:16.680 --> 09:28:20.760
Also, you might want to make more tea before sleeping or after waking up or for my voice

09:28:21.960 --> 09:28:26.760
I mean, it felt like a justifiable rage or he just won't make us class. The rage was justified. Okay

09:28:27.320 --> 09:28:29.320
Congrats. You did good job thing

09:28:30.040 --> 09:28:34.040
So now you need more than an app. You may need to fill it. Oh, I hope I can get like a full eight hours

09:28:34.040 --> 09:28:36.040
I've been needing it for a while

09:28:37.000 --> 09:28:40.440
You didn't give up. So you did a good job at least. Heck yeah

09:28:41.880 --> 09:28:48.360
Mad cause bad. Lamar true. Literally all I had to do was pull out the grenade launcher

09:28:49.480 --> 09:28:51.480
apparently

09:28:51.880 --> 09:28:53.560
Lucky me

09:28:53.560 --> 09:28:55.560
Lucky me. All I had to do was pull out

09:28:56.920 --> 09:28:58.920
Take these head pads

09:28:59.480 --> 09:29:01.480
I would have went insane. You're amazing

09:29:02.200 --> 09:29:07.720
Well, then I feel like you guys probably would have figured out to swap to the weapon way before I did so

09:29:08.520 --> 09:29:12.200
Sending hugs if they're welcome. Otherwise you did so good. I'll take those hugs

09:29:13.240 --> 09:29:15.960
Are you the first person to finish this campaign on stream?

09:29:16.520 --> 09:29:20.600
Stop imagine if I was like the first vtuber to play this game. That would be hilarious

09:29:21.400 --> 09:29:27.880
And and the pov is like isn't the navi side amazing and then the rd side is me just screaming

09:29:27.880 --> 09:29:33.240
Sorry for forcing you to play that. I feel bad now. Nah, come on. I can stop at any time

09:29:35.000 --> 09:29:37.720
I just say stilettos and then I would stop don't worry

09:29:38.680 --> 09:29:44.120
If you're the first that counts as a world record, I would have thrown my monitor before changing weapons

09:29:44.760 --> 09:29:46.760
making vtuber history

09:29:46.760 --> 09:29:52.520
Oh, so when an angry scot rages. Oh, so wins the angry scotch rages somewhere, honestly

09:29:53.400 --> 09:30:02.280
I'm pretty sure you are though. Oh, no, I'm what sorry. I've already I've already forgotten what I'm probably would overgrinding did

09:30:03.480 --> 09:30:08.600
Before and killed it with a bigger number. You're probably the only one that ever will you can be the avatar vtuber

09:30:10.040 --> 09:30:12.520
The way of the water the way of the scot

09:30:14.040 --> 09:30:16.200
You did great powering through that heck. Yeah

09:30:16.760 --> 09:30:19.960
Think about it. You used the worst weapon to beat the game. Honestly

09:30:20.760 --> 09:30:24.520
I actually think you are the first vtuber to do on straight vtuber history

09:30:24.600 --> 09:30:27.640
Not even a weekend after debut. I'm already making history

09:30:28.120 --> 09:30:33.720
But see fully the rda was a lot more fun than the navi. Why because of the rage apparently everyone's got

09:30:33.960 --> 09:30:37.000
You know half masked at the moment because they liked my rage

09:30:38.440 --> 09:30:41.800
The way of the scot the cut fish the way school and

09:30:42.840 --> 09:30:47.000
You have a full monopoly on this game now. Okay. Okay. I'll take it. I'll take it

09:30:47.960 --> 09:30:51.160
I'm the type to pause the game and watch a video spin feeding me on what to do

09:30:51.480 --> 09:30:55.000
Honestly small streamer did two years ago, but for both campaigns. Yes

09:30:56.280 --> 09:30:58.280
half half

09:30:58.440 --> 09:31:02.760
Now I'm going to get the game to relieve or to relive the pain

09:31:03.560 --> 09:31:05.560
You can't me

09:31:06.440 --> 09:31:11.480
Yeah, let's say half only half wait, there's no way I need to make a rage ASMR if that's okay

09:31:12.360 --> 09:31:14.360
I don't mean suffering like that

09:31:14.680 --> 09:31:18.520
Like honestly, I feel fine now, but I guess in the moment. I was like scary region

09:31:20.040 --> 09:31:23.080
Sorry if I scared anyone. I apologize

09:31:24.680 --> 09:31:28.040
Got some ancestral rage built up in me, I guess

09:31:31.800 --> 09:31:34.760
Me just skipping 60 percent past all the enemies honestly

09:31:35.560 --> 09:31:39.480
60 percent probably like 100 percent of the optional fights I skipped like I'm not even kidding

09:31:39.800 --> 09:31:41.800
Now you scare us more. No, you didn't scare

09:31:43.480 --> 09:31:46.360
You could do it more. You're like, well, I do have a

09:31:47.880 --> 09:31:51.720
Donut lawn reward potentially being that rage, but yeah

09:31:52.920 --> 09:31:57.720
Stormy rage air should be like you call that. Oh, I willy. That's just prophetic, you know

09:32:00.840 --> 09:32:05.320
That was uh, that wasn't scary. It was the opposite. Oh the fabled scotch rage

09:32:05.640 --> 09:32:11.080
I mean, I was scared and felt something else at the same time. I'm not gonna explain. That's actually hilarious

09:32:11.640 --> 09:32:15.720
I didn't know that had that effect. It makes me remember the banshee scream. Oh

09:32:17.320 --> 09:32:22.280
I'm not sure I can even banshee scream like I can do it like my screams very loud

09:32:22.360 --> 09:32:26.040
But I'm not gonna scream because I I think after the rage

09:32:26.440 --> 09:32:31.240
I don't know if one of the neighbors are probably trying to listen in on me right now and be like what is going on

09:32:32.840 --> 09:32:34.840
Angry hypnosis ASMR

09:32:35.000 --> 09:32:39.560
Get hypnotized. Get hypnotized. Get hypnotized. I still prefer subspace

09:32:42.440 --> 09:32:44.440
Just yelling get up

09:32:47.080 --> 09:32:53.160
Right, um, they're gonna call the police on you. I've actually wondered if it's a possibility

09:32:53.720 --> 09:32:57.480
I did speak to my neighbors at one point

09:32:58.600 --> 09:33:01.560
And I explained to them that I'm a voice actress

09:33:02.200 --> 09:33:06.440
So if they hear anything at night, don't be too worried. It's just me

09:33:09.560 --> 09:33:12.440
So my voice acting's a bit different

09:33:13.640 --> 09:33:19.080
Um, can you make a reward that you just scream scottland forever scottland forever

09:33:19.720 --> 09:33:24.840
Passive aggressive ASMR. They're like, is she okay in there? Does she need help?

09:33:26.280 --> 09:33:29.560
If someone clip that moment the clip will give but we'll get pretty

09:33:31.800 --> 09:33:34.840
Oh the toothbrushing I'm gonna go get my toothbrush. Okay

09:33:36.280 --> 09:33:39.480
I'll be right back. We're gonna if you want to get your toothbrush and brush your teeth

09:34:01.560 --> 09:34:03.560
I

09:34:21.320 --> 09:34:23.560
Got one out of 21 days to brush our teeth

09:34:24.760 --> 09:34:26.920
Wait, let me put my headset on so I can listen to the

09:34:27.560 --> 09:34:32.840
Thingy right. I got my toothbrush. It could be a sound pack from morning alarms. Just full bag pouch

09:34:35.320 --> 09:34:38.520
I have toothpaste because I salivate a lot. I don't know about you

09:34:38.520 --> 09:34:41.720
But whenever something enters my mouth, it starts to salivate like crazy

09:34:41.880 --> 09:34:44.280
We're gonna brush our teeth and then we'll read into

09:34:45.560 --> 09:34:49.400
Yeah, mercy. I was gonna call her mousy for a second. What's she eating a mouse?

09:34:50.840 --> 09:34:52.840
Are you ready?

09:34:52.840 --> 09:34:54.840
Are you ready to brush your teethies?

09:34:55.320 --> 09:34:56.680
With me

09:34:56.680 --> 09:34:59.800
I'm gonna do it for two minutes. Okay. That's how long you brush your teeth

09:34:59.880 --> 09:35:02.600
So just start with the front of your teeth, right?

09:35:03.320 --> 09:35:07.720
I see you. I do you want me to mute the game so you can like really hear the brushy brush

09:35:09.320 --> 09:35:11.320
Yeah

09:35:11.720 --> 09:35:17.080
I don't think you're gonna hear it over the thing. No, I will start a two minute counter now

09:35:18.520 --> 09:35:20.040
Uh

09:35:20.040 --> 09:35:22.040
Oh, yeah, sorry. Let me mute the game

09:35:23.000 --> 09:35:27.160
I was probably gonna break now that I'm out and it's tabbed out of the game. There we go

09:35:28.280 --> 09:35:30.920
Do you have a chanting? I do have chanting. Hold on

09:35:32.120 --> 09:35:35.960
Uh, whoa, that's a lot of words to speed up one. Hold on

09:35:37.560 --> 09:35:42.760
Uh, I got sorry. I've got toothpaste on my mouth right now. Pardon me. One second one second

09:35:43.240 --> 09:35:45.240
I will do that and I do this

09:35:47.080 --> 09:35:49.640
Okay, we're brushing our teethies

09:35:52.760 --> 09:35:54.760
Um

09:35:55.080 --> 09:35:57.880
Okay, two minutes of teeth brushing is a lot

09:36:00.360 --> 09:36:05.080
Oh, no, you can hear my background music shift back my music you're ruining it. Uh

09:36:09.240 --> 09:36:13.320
Wait two minutes so um 39 minutes left

09:36:17.160 --> 09:36:19.160
Wait make sure you do the outside first

09:36:19.480 --> 09:36:26.440
Oh my god, I'm out of chocolate right already. Um, I don't think this is enough product

09:36:37.560 --> 09:36:43.080
Okay, now the bit that most people miss I'm spitting everywhere. Hold on. I need more

09:36:43.320 --> 09:36:45.560
Does that have a pillow in this room? I don't

09:36:46.680 --> 09:36:49.000
I have so much saliva coming out of my mouth

09:36:53.160 --> 09:36:56.760
Do the back of your front teeth and the back of your front bottom teeth

09:36:56.760 --> 09:36:59.560
That's the most forgotten place when you brush your teeth, okay?

09:37:06.040 --> 09:37:08.040
Oh

09:37:13.400 --> 09:37:15.400

We are good with things

09:37:32.120 --> 09:37:34.120
And we go that

09:37:34.280 --> 09:37:36.760
Don't brush too hard on your gum drool receipt. I don't

09:37:37.880 --> 09:37:41.000
No root canals. We don't believe in root canals in this house

09:37:41.960 --> 09:37:43.960
Root canal blood

09:37:46.760 --> 09:37:50.440
Haemorrhoids, yeah, we don't have haemorrhoids in this community

09:37:55.800 --> 09:38:00.360
Uh, I can't pull off because I don't know about the foster but it's just gonna brush my teeth in general

09:38:01.240 --> 09:38:03.880
And we're gonna do it for a quite one day in a row

09:38:04.920 --> 09:38:06.600

09:38:06.600 --> 09:38:13.480
Everyone's gonna have a teeth brush and have it okay, and life is nice and easy. Oh my god the spit is going over to the paper towel

No, not mouth haemorrhoids booty haemorrhoids

Okay, and make sure you do circular motions. That's how you get all the the peas and poos off your teeth

09:38:37.240 --> 09:38:40.040
Okay, I think I'm almost done

09:38:45.800 --> 09:38:50.440
Is there a toothbrush out for a reason? No, no, it's just brushing our teeth

09:38:52.680 --> 09:38:55.560
Yeah, we're getting the because we didn't know

09:38:57.640 --> 09:39:02.520

Thank you for the drink. No, not my used toothpaste spit

09:39:37.160 --> 09:39:41.960
The only thing I don't like about toothpaste is that it keeps sitting

09:39:42.920 --> 09:39:47.400
Like it keeps in your you're not to you're not to rinse that way, but if you need to spit it out like

09:39:53.960 --> 09:39:55.480
Okay

09:39:55.480 --> 09:39:58.680
Did it we played the world's most annoying

09:40:00.520 --> 09:40:04.280
Right, I'm going to make triple sure I am redirecting into mercy

09:40:05.160 --> 09:40:08.520

09:40:36.360 --> 09:40:38.360
Kind of just came out

09:40:38.600 --> 09:40:40.760
I said what everyone was thinking and said

09:40:42.120 --> 09:40:45.400
But uh, yeah that game needs a hot patch for a weapon drill. So I'm saying

09:40:47.240 --> 09:40:51.400
It won't let me open the redirect thing. Why not?

09:40:53.240 --> 09:40:57.800
YouTube you're so stinky sometimes it won't let me load so I can redirect into mercy

09:40:57.880 --> 09:41:00.440
I need to wait for it to load. Okay. I did it now

09:41:01.720 --> 09:41:06.200
Oh, tomorrow we have old school runesgate. Oh, I need to make my account

09:41:06.600 --> 09:41:09.400
But what do I call my account is the question?

09:41:14.120 --> 09:41:17.400
Customization redirect add

09:41:18.920 --> 09:41:22.280
A difficulty right into mercy say

09:41:34.040 --> 09:41:40.200
Right my little reeflings I honestly didn't think we were gonna I honestly thought we're gonna end out four hours

09:41:40.200 --> 09:41:43.640
But what made it to almost 10 hours should look us go

09:41:44.520 --> 09:41:46.520
You guys have so much stamina

09:41:47.800 --> 09:41:51.560
Wait, wait, can I try this out? Hold on. I don't know if I can try this out right now

09:41:52.200 --> 09:41:54.200
Is this gonna work or is this gonna break?

09:41:55.800 --> 09:41:57.800
Oh

09:42:00.680 --> 09:42:05.000
You did so well you make me so proud

09:42:07.560 --> 09:42:12.840
Such long unending stamina for me

09:42:14.840 --> 09:42:16.840
Did it work?

09:42:19.480 --> 09:42:22.680
Did it work? Did I have a reverb effect when I did that?

09:42:22.840 --> 09:42:25.320
I don't know if that worked or not or did I mess it up?

09:42:27.400 --> 09:42:30.200
What do you mean looking at school? You're the crazy one who took bail

09:42:30.840 --> 09:42:35.400
So if I'm feeling like it is yeah, the reverb was like yes, I work. I'm so happy

09:42:37.240 --> 09:42:40.600
If my voice wasn't so burst I'd do a bit more but it's burst right now

09:42:41.800 --> 09:42:43.800
Big burst big burst

09:42:46.280 --> 09:42:48.280
All hail the glowfish

09:42:49.000 --> 09:42:55.240
It looks good when my like eyes and my little shells you can kind of see the transparency of my shells a bit by our like this

09:42:56.440 --> 09:42:57.960
Maybe

09:42:57.960 --> 09:42:59.960
You can see my reflectives

09:42:59.960 --> 09:43:01.960
thing going on

09:43:02.200 --> 09:43:04.200
It works though

09:43:04.360 --> 09:43:05.720
Wait talk a bit

09:43:05.720 --> 09:43:11.960
Okay, I'm glad it worked. Right. I am going to end it there without a fantastic endurance room

09:43:12.200 --> 09:43:17.640
Tomorrow is old school runescape. So just so you know the plan the plan is

09:43:18.440 --> 09:43:19.800
that

09:43:19.800 --> 09:43:24.440
We what I'm going to make a new fresh account. You don't have to

09:43:25.400 --> 09:43:26.360
but

09:43:26.360 --> 09:43:31.560
My idea was that we do some questing to level up and then we basically

09:43:32.120 --> 09:43:36.520
Just have fun leveling up cooking and see what where it goes

09:43:37.240 --> 09:43:39.000
um

09:43:39.000 --> 09:43:41.000
But I'm a bit rubbish at like

09:43:42.280 --> 09:43:46.120
Quest so it would be nice to try them together like cooks assistant. Um

09:43:47.080 --> 09:43:52.520
I'm sure there's like a vam that haunted house quest. I can't remember its name right now

09:43:53.000 --> 09:43:55.560
But we're going to do like those kind of questings

09:43:56.360 --> 09:43:58.280
and then

09:43:58.280 --> 09:44:02.520
We can do some fishing together and we'll cook the fish

09:44:03.160 --> 09:44:07.000
outside of the barbarian village because that's free

09:44:07.960 --> 09:44:09.240
um

09:44:09.240 --> 09:44:12.600
And we can cook crayfish for free. I'm pretty sure you just need to get in it

09:44:13.400 --> 09:44:17.640
Are you doing members? I think so. That's my only issue

09:44:17.720 --> 09:44:22.120
I'm gonna buy membership, but I'll play like I'll go into a free-to-play lobby

09:44:22.440 --> 09:44:25.800
And we can do the free-to-play quests and take it from there

09:44:26.680 --> 09:44:31.800
Because I'm not entirely sure what the plan is after that

09:44:33.240 --> 09:44:35.240
I joined you on old school

09:44:35.800 --> 09:44:37.800

We can see all the reefling gang gang. I'm tired. It's fine. I know. I know what you meant

09:45:00.920 --> 09:45:05.080

09:45:05.800 --> 09:45:07.800
Yeah

09:45:08.120 --> 09:45:14.520
Some people thought they were vampire fangs, but they're not that's jack. You can't really see my ears, but they're slightly pointed

09:45:15.080 --> 09:45:17.080
No pointy

09:45:18.360 --> 09:45:22.600

Are you planning on playing something at follow 76?

09:45:31.880 --> 09:45:35.320
I think that's multiplayer, but I don't know how to get you in my lobby

09:45:35.560 --> 09:45:40.440
Like how do I get reeflings in lobby or is it like can we make a lobby code?

09:45:40.760 --> 09:45:42.760
And it's like a server like they host

09:45:43.400 --> 09:45:45.400
I'm not sure how 76 works

09:45:46.520 --> 09:45:48.840
Get bit by the fish you want to buy

09:45:50.840 --> 09:45:53.400
Would you let me bite you reefling?

09:45:54.280 --> 09:45:56.280
That's terrible

09:45:57.400 --> 09:45:59.400
You should let me do it

09:46:00.360 --> 09:46:03.480
I love your choice of games so far makes me safe to see what else you got play

09:46:05.080 --> 09:46:09.880
Well, I'm glad you like the game so far. I'm literally just picking childhood stuff and stuff that makes me happy

09:46:10.920 --> 09:46:12.920
So I'm glad

09:46:12.920 --> 09:46:15.240
But yes old-school RuneScape definitely

09:46:15.960 --> 09:46:18.120
might be a reoccurring multiplayer for a little bit

09:46:18.680 --> 09:46:20.280
um

09:46:20.280 --> 09:46:21.560
I'm not really gonna

09:46:21.560 --> 09:46:25.880
I'm not sure what happens when membership what membership streams are planned

09:46:26.680 --> 09:46:28.680
I think we'll also do

09:46:28.840 --> 09:46:31.960
I think three membership streams a week possibly

09:46:33.480 --> 09:46:39.000
One for react movie one for membership

09:46:41.160 --> 09:46:45.720
Multiplayer I'll decide like I wouldn't do like progression

09:46:46.600 --> 09:46:48.920
on old-school RuneScape multiplayer

09:46:49.720 --> 09:46:52.680
Behind a membership stream because that's not fair for those invested

09:46:53.400 --> 09:46:55.400
So maybe

09:46:56.200 --> 09:46:58.200
Maybe maybe um

09:46:59.640 --> 09:47:07.400
I first I first played again yesterday for the first time used old-school RuneScape and a goblin got you

09:47:07.400 --> 09:47:11.480
You got done at goblin village a dead by daylight member stream. Yeah

09:47:12.600 --> 09:47:18.600
I'm open to these kind of things, but yeah one I want to consistently have a member stream

09:47:21.160 --> 09:47:23.160
When memberships open

09:47:24.120 --> 09:47:25.160
Uh

09:47:25.160 --> 09:47:30.520
I react and they like we'll watch a movie together and then I might also do a script writing

09:47:31.400 --> 09:47:32.520
Scream

09:47:32.520 --> 09:47:36.200
Or maybe show you some behind the scenes stuff like maybe we write shorts

09:47:36.280 --> 09:47:37.000
I don't know

09:47:37.000 --> 09:47:42.520
I'm trying to think of like stuff you guys want to see and then of course we could just like maybe smaller games that aren't

09:47:43.080 --> 09:47:45.400
Necessarily stream worthy on main

09:47:45.880 --> 09:47:50.280
So for those of you who are unable to membership, please don't worry

09:47:50.760 --> 09:47:54.280
I always have free content coming out and I

09:47:55.160 --> 09:47:59.080
For days like so, you know how we played needy streamer overload yesterday

09:47:59.640 --> 09:48:02.520
Because that was only two hours long like that's a short game

09:48:03.000 --> 09:48:08.120
I would then come back online after maybe like a 30 minute rest and then do a membership stream

09:48:08.360 --> 09:48:12.520
So you still get like content that day and then like I'll raid into whoever's online

09:48:13.240 --> 09:48:14.600
um

09:48:14.600 --> 09:48:19.160
And like keep going so yeah, don't worry. She streams eight days a week

09:48:20.120 --> 09:48:26.920
Yeah, don't ever worry and like obviously the ace mark comes out as well. That's like free on youtube. You can watch on youtube anytime

09:48:27.960 --> 09:48:29.560
and

09:48:29.560 --> 09:48:35.000
Script writing stream or submit scripts. Yes, it would be a bit hard to review

09:48:36.120 --> 09:48:38.920
Scripts live because I would need to use euphemism

09:48:40.680 --> 09:48:45.480
That's nice as long as you're not overworking yourself. I will make what I can handle and

09:48:46.360 --> 09:48:48.360
We can take it from there

09:48:48.760 --> 09:48:50.760
Yeah

09:48:50.920 --> 09:48:52.920
Get that Hermione to

09:48:53.240 --> 09:48:56.600
Rewind time and overlap herself streaming honestly

09:48:57.960 --> 09:48:59.960
True true

09:49:00.920 --> 09:49:05.480
I'll need to see eventually be able to close your eyes and see her for a moment. You don't watch

09:49:07.240 --> 09:49:09.240
Always online

09:49:10.040 --> 09:49:13.960
There are always rooms so yes, please never worry if you don't have the money for membership

09:49:14.200 --> 09:49:17.720
Because I stream every day and you can come see me every day. Um

09:49:18.760 --> 09:49:19.800
and

09:49:19.800 --> 09:49:27.640
Yeah, I'll make sure everyone gets their money's worth either way because I don't like when streamers don't get their money's worth

09:49:28.600 --> 09:49:34.120
All right, sorry. I don't I don't like when streamers don't get their money's worth. That's just me. So yeah, um

09:49:35.400 --> 09:49:42.920
Strony's a stream and beast. I'm sure she'll have something for you. Yeah, I've got something for everyone or that's the plan anyway

09:49:43.160 --> 09:49:45.160
Hopefully I got something for everyone

09:49:46.120 --> 09:49:54.120
So you're saying is I should never become a member only if you are financially capable and

09:49:54.920 --> 09:50:02.040
If you're only financially capable to support one person, I recommend doing my daughters over me. Okay

09:50:03.480 --> 09:50:07.480
Um because I always have free accessible content

09:50:08.120 --> 09:50:10.200
a always coming out so yeah

09:50:11.000 --> 09:50:14.360
Yeah, we love you strong. Please don't try my blood. Yes

09:50:16.520 --> 09:50:19.000
You're such a good girl. It's insane. Yeah

09:50:23.320 --> 09:50:28.280
I will skip meals to members. Stop. No, we're not doing these jokes. I don't actually don't like these

09:50:29.240 --> 09:50:33.320
There was like one joke that was like, oh, I'm I'm like in a homeless shelter

09:50:33.640 --> 09:50:35.880
And then I've given you like membership or whatever. I don't know

09:50:36.600 --> 09:50:43.000
It's actually probably one I am like so goofy and non-series all the time. Those kind of jokes are like

09:50:44.920 --> 09:50:46.920
I don't like them

09:50:48.040 --> 09:50:50.040
I sold my kidney. Yes. I was like

09:50:50.600 --> 09:50:52.600
No, I don't like

09:50:52.600 --> 09:50:57.720
You definitely have a few streams that I need to rewatch. I love it though. Oh, they're long streams

09:50:58.120 --> 09:51:03.240
You'll be rewatching for a while, but I'm good for putting on in the background for a rambling if you ever like

09:51:03.880 --> 09:51:07.800
I need I want to listen to something in the background, but I don't want to actually focus in

09:51:08.280 --> 09:51:13.720
Yeah, just put the avatar stream on and then when it comes to the rda part when I start screaming my head off

09:51:14.200 --> 09:51:15.240
my

09:51:15.240 --> 09:51:17.240
my scarier, but

09:51:17.800 --> 09:51:22.360
I'm looking forward to your first ace round stream. Hope youtube doesn't do anything. Um, I'm a bit worried

09:51:22.360 --> 09:51:28.280
But I'm not going to be doing earlicking or anything like that. I don't know what the heck youtube's been playing at recently

09:51:28.280 --> 09:51:30.280
It's making me nervous to even upload my like

09:51:31.160 --> 09:51:35.480
1,000 rewards and there's literally nothing wrong with that freaking audios

09:51:36.680 --> 09:51:40.840
Well, I just made a brand new school roadscape. It's been years and I look forward to it. Yay

09:51:41.560 --> 09:51:44.520
I will tell everyone the server when we get on tomorrow

09:51:44.600 --> 09:51:47.400
Like I'll put it on screen and I'll say like this is the world that we're in

09:51:47.880 --> 09:51:56.840
Um, and we'll start outside Lumbridge castle where the starting point is. Um, I'm literally gonna make an account put membership on it and then

09:51:57.800 --> 09:52:03.480
I get online for stream and we'll take it from there. I don't know what to name myself. So I need to name myself something

09:52:04.040 --> 09:52:10.760
Mildly humorous, but I haven't decided yet. Maybe skullfish. That'd be nice. Oh, no someone someone. Ah, well, if you take my name

09:52:10.760 --> 09:52:13.160
It's fine. I don't know. I'll need to think of something

09:52:14.600 --> 09:52:16.600
Do you have a place where you'll upload?

09:52:18.280 --> 09:52:20.280
Money's for veggie might

09:52:20.360 --> 09:52:22.360
No, I don't have to try vegemite

09:52:23.000 --> 09:52:32.200
I'll get vegemite then for the hand cam stream. Thank you reluctantly saying I'll get vegemite in freaking toast

09:52:32.200 --> 09:52:34.760
I don't even buy bread. I don't even get buy bread

09:52:35.560 --> 09:52:38.760
Skullfish is a good one. Thanks. I stole it from a reefling

09:52:39.960 --> 09:52:44.200
Thank you for giving me that. Um, wait, do we need a membership on old school runescape to

09:52:45.240 --> 09:52:48.600
Not necessarily for what we're gonna do

09:52:48.760 --> 09:52:53.560
But I think if we I don't know yet like I don't know we're gonna do some quests

09:52:53.640 --> 09:52:59.240
But I'm pretty sure like everything's behind a freaking lock and it's so expensive for old school runescape membership

09:52:59.640 --> 09:53:04.520
I don't know. Maybe there's a rich reefling that's willing to buy bonds and gift it to reeflings

09:53:04.600 --> 09:53:07.960
But that's not like my place to ask for

09:53:08.840 --> 09:53:11.640
It's a bit. Hmm. I don't know if we have any

09:53:12.440 --> 09:53:15.160
try hard reeflings on old school runescape like

09:53:16.120 --> 09:53:18.760
I think I have about 12,000 coins in old

09:53:20.360 --> 09:53:22.360
So I can't buy anyone a bond. Sorry

09:53:23.880 --> 09:53:29.240
And I'm starting on a fresh account. I don't know. Maybe we can like pull our money together to buy bonds to like share to reeflings

09:53:30.280 --> 09:53:34.520
Will there be you're looking on patreon? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're looking on patreon. It's not problem for me

09:53:34.760 --> 09:53:36.760
Um, do what we want on patreon

09:53:38.520 --> 09:53:40.520
The other place we upload wards

09:53:41.240 --> 09:53:44.120
You asked that and I read that out and then I didn't even reply to you

09:53:44.840 --> 09:53:51.240
No, well, um, the girls have been using twitter and like putting a go like a download link out

09:53:51.880 --> 09:53:55.480
um, I don't think any of my content's gonna get taken down because

09:53:57.240 --> 09:53:59.240
I know the rules

09:53:59.240 --> 09:54:01.240
I know how to

09:54:03.560 --> 09:54:09.720
Um, so I don't think we're gonna any any oilers in chat literally any old school runescape oilers. Uh, we summon you

09:54:10.680 --> 09:54:12.680
I'd like to call upon you

09:54:14.040 --> 09:54:17.640
My membership is still six dollars because I've had an active substance. Wait

09:54:19.080 --> 09:54:22.840
You lock in the same subscription price because you did it all the way back then

09:54:24.040 --> 09:54:26.040
But then you do that you're looking anyway

09:54:26.600 --> 09:54:28.600
I can look this way

09:54:29.000 --> 09:54:31.000
She knows the cheese

09:54:32.680 --> 09:54:38.200
Never touch runescape. Unfortunately. It's like a really, um, it's not a hard game

09:54:38.280 --> 09:54:42.040
It's literally point and click if you wanted to try it for the first time you can always

09:54:42.520 --> 09:54:47.880
Start up with us. Um, but if it's not for you, you don't have to play along. It's okay. Please don't worry

09:54:49.160 --> 09:54:53.880
I know you've been going for nine hours. That's crazy. Look, I'm just gonna yapping. Okay

09:54:55.080 --> 09:54:59.480
I mean, I could check out marshmallow and we can make it to 10 hours if you want

09:55:00.040 --> 09:55:03.240
Like I could put my little marshmallow link in the chat

09:55:03.480 --> 09:55:05.480
He he he

09:55:06.680 --> 09:55:11.720
Oh my marshmallows in the descriptions. Hold on. I even have I can't even see my screen right now

09:55:12.360 --> 09:55:15.880
My my stream not my screen. I can't see my screen because it's right in front of me

09:55:17.720 --> 09:55:21.880
Um, but hold on. How did I do this? How did I put it in chat?

09:55:24.360 --> 09:55:26.360
I am about to sneeze

09:55:26.840 --> 09:55:28.840
Boom, oh no

09:55:28.840 --> 09:55:35.000
Oh, no, it'd be such a shame if you guys asked me questions to round this up to a 10 hour stream. Stop

09:55:36.360 --> 09:55:38.360
Stop it

09:55:38.440 --> 09:55:40.440
We're right on the verge of 10 hours. Oh

09:55:41.560 --> 09:55:43.560
A little countdown to 10 hours, shall we?

09:55:44.040 --> 09:55:46.040
Well, my four minutes left

09:55:48.040 --> 09:55:50.040
Oh, I have a lot of marshmallows. Whoops

09:55:51.160 --> 09:55:55.000
Someone says I'd love to spread your cheeks and lick every perfect. Oh

09:55:55.560 --> 09:56:02.600
I wasn't supposed to read that part out loud. Hey, I'm glad you do

09:56:05.960 --> 09:56:10.760
Uh, god, your salty gamer rage makes me want to have hard sweaty angry

09:56:13.880 --> 09:56:16.120
I can't can't read that one either. Um

09:56:16.200 --> 09:56:18.200
Um

09:56:24.440 --> 09:56:29.400
Hi, scrawny, hopefully you're well. This is my first time using marshmallow glad I could pop your marshmallow cherry

09:56:29.640 --> 09:56:31.640
I don't know if you

09:56:32.360 --> 09:56:34.920
Read any of these. Oh, I read all my marshmallows

09:56:35.640 --> 09:56:37.640
Hmm. I have a few questions

09:56:38.040 --> 09:56:44.760
You stream so much that I'm wondering if you'll be taking a break from ASMR. No, I'm streaming ASMR in two days

09:56:45.640 --> 09:56:51.400
No break from ASMR. I've got ASMR cards coming out as well. I just need to write the scripts and send them off

09:56:51.960 --> 09:56:53.960
but it's gonna be good

09:56:56.760 --> 09:57:01.160
Yeah, I've got time for ASMR all the time because yeah, I also got loads of managers in place

09:57:01.640 --> 09:57:07.000
The only thing I need to do really is be the messenger owl that sends clips to editors now and

09:57:07.400 --> 09:57:13.080
Upload stuff on behalf of the girls like Mercy just wakes up and she's like got new shorts on her channel. She has no idea

09:57:13.480 --> 09:57:16.440
That's me doing it. Actually Emmy has another

09:57:16.920 --> 09:57:21.880
Is that short? Yeah, Emmy has a short and she's like she's just gonna wake up and it's gonna be on her channel

09:57:23.320 --> 09:57:25.320
Already tagged up and everything for

09:57:26.040 --> 09:57:28.040
Yeah

09:57:29.880 --> 09:57:31.880
Unless I didn't read that right

09:57:35.800 --> 09:57:38.760
Yeah, I know I know how my ASMR is gonna be

09:57:39.400 --> 09:57:43.480
I can also upload full videos to Twitter as well if anything ever did become an issue

09:57:43.560 --> 09:57:46.760
Like if I did like a little ASMR video, so it's not a problem

09:57:47.400 --> 09:57:52.920
The level organization is ascending as so the girls aren't stressed if the girls had to stream

09:57:54.360 --> 09:57:58.120
And they had to run around and worry about trying to get clips out and shorts out

09:57:59.320 --> 09:58:02.680
Not good combo. Not nice. Not nice. Um

09:58:03.240 --> 09:58:05.240
Oh

09:58:08.360 --> 09:58:12.280
No, wait, what hi strong you feel a bit embarrassed. We are not supposed to be there

09:58:16.840 --> 09:58:21.720
Oh, no, it's okay someone says they feel embarrassed because they messed up in chat at some point

09:58:21.880 --> 09:58:27.320
Don't be silly. You're allowed to mess up and chat all you want. I can't even I can't even write in English

09:58:28.120 --> 09:58:36.280
I like don't worry like emmy emmy had to a script where she had to see a putty cat and I accidentally typed pssy

09:58:37.480 --> 09:58:40.840
Like don't be afraid. I'm making embarrassment mistakes. They're not embarrassing at all

09:58:41.480 --> 09:58:45.400
Actually, you only feel embarrassment if you let yourself feel embarrassment or something like that

09:58:45.480 --> 09:58:48.280
It's something about psychology. Like if if you make mistakes

09:58:50.520 --> 09:58:52.520
Yeah

09:58:53.480 --> 09:58:58.440
View the girls trying to find a non-lid marshmallow read on stream and possible is honestly not that bad

09:58:58.520 --> 09:59:04.280
I don't get that many. I honestly don't get that many like the girls show me what they get and I don't seem to get

09:59:04.360 --> 09:59:09.880
But I haven't been using the other twitter. I think once I start using it properly them

09:59:11.480 --> 09:59:13.480
Yeah

09:59:14.280 --> 09:59:19.480
Question for you the other day we talked with casted greek brother hood about how you're the mother of the girls

09:59:19.480 --> 09:59:24.840
And the reeflings are the father. Does that make emmy your daughter or sister or a daughter or sister?

09:59:36.200 --> 09:59:41.320
If you're a reefling then technically daughter sister, but if you're not a reefling then it's just a little sister

09:59:42.200 --> 09:59:44.200
Boom

09:59:44.600 --> 09:59:51.000
New audio idea angry scots women mounts and rides you after being all day as a fellow scotton

09:59:51.000 --> 09:59:53.000
I just were hotter than here and so on

09:59:56.680 --> 10:00:02.200
So I listened to the assassin's creed stream and I was happy that you remembered me and give her the yeah

10:00:02.600 --> 10:00:05.000
You're like the the main clipper

10:00:06.520 --> 10:00:10.440
I actually didn't ask that question. I think there was someone else who made a few clips as well

10:00:10.680 --> 10:00:14.280
I thought about making clips and posting them, but I wasn't too sure if I could use that

10:00:14.360 --> 10:00:17.240
Oh, no, you can go brah. That's your channel. You own it

10:00:18.200 --> 10:00:24.520
You make you make custom content. You you have made new creative content. Then guess what copyright is in your favor

10:00:24.680 --> 10:00:28.360
Don't worry about copyright. Okay. You don't have to worry about copyright or are you joking me?

10:00:28.600 --> 10:00:30.600
Clip the girls away. Have fun. Have that ye

10:00:32.440 --> 10:00:35.000
I'm friends with the guy who's already itching to draw the fan art

10:00:36.200 --> 10:00:40.040
Fan art of who what door what door is getting fan art? Please tell me I want to know

10:00:41.000 --> 10:00:43.000
I love seeing them get fan art

10:00:44.120 --> 10:00:46.120
They sound good

10:00:48.200 --> 10:00:52.360
I like with the olympians better better not think about the family

10:01:00.920 --> 10:01:05.320
Uh, what type of hypnotism is your favorite?

10:01:10.600 --> 10:01:14.440
That's too hard to answer honestly

10:01:15.400 --> 10:01:17.400
I like hypno loss

10:01:17.400 --> 10:01:19.400
I really like hypno loss

10:01:19.480 --> 10:01:23.720
Where I'm supposed to hypnotize you, but then backfires and I do as you say

10:01:25.080 --> 10:01:26.680
So good

10:01:26.680 --> 10:01:32.520
Any chance of a spiral? Let's play. Oh, I've never played spiral like that before. I would like to try it

10:01:32.520 --> 10:01:36.200
I'm pretty sure they remastered them and they're like nice cam friendly casual

10:01:36.280 --> 10:01:41.880
Seems like something that's like cameo-esque where it's like nice and simple to get through so I think yeah

10:01:43.960 --> 10:01:45.960
You like fraction

10:01:48.040 --> 10:01:50.040
I would say yes overall

10:01:52.600 --> 10:01:59.640
It's the one where you go into like a difference or am I I'm I'm messing up for subspace. I might messing up for subspace. Hold on

10:02:01.240 --> 10:02:03.240
I am

10:02:03.560 --> 10:02:07.400
Hey, story. I'm probably being a dumb dumb and I haven't found them yet

10:02:07.400 --> 10:02:11.400
But I was wondering if you could get reference sheets for all the girls chat mask. Oh, yes

10:02:14.840 --> 10:02:19.560
Amy's chat mascot is in her debut stream you are

10:02:21.560 --> 10:02:28.520
The light in my dark you are the beating in my heart. I showed you yesterday

10:02:29.320 --> 10:02:35.080
I should get a reference sheet from them all put together. Maybe I'll get a tweet from the the bail on

10:02:35.800 --> 10:02:37.800
mmm

10:02:37.800 --> 10:02:40.200
I can't because Amy's is in a different art style

10:02:44.440 --> 10:02:46.440
Hmm

10:02:47.160 --> 10:02:52.280
I know what you're asking for. I don't know the best way to do it. Maybe the discord can post them

10:02:52.440 --> 10:03:00.360
Maybe maybe the discord should have a reference sheet for all cart all the girls and their mascots

10:03:00.600 --> 10:03:03.480
That might be the solution that we can come to

10:03:04.840 --> 10:03:07.160
Would you like to come together on a solution?

10:03:08.280 --> 10:03:10.280
Or would you like to come together?

10:03:13.960 --> 10:03:18.200
I'm a little late but congrats on the debuts can't wait to see you and the rest of the girls have in store

10:03:18.200 --> 10:03:21.320
And it was nice hearing her scorch moment again. Glad you're back

10:03:21.960 --> 10:03:27.880
Sincerely a h little reddish boy. Oh, yeah, it's good to be back terrorizing you

10:03:29.160 --> 10:03:33.480
He he he he he I cannot wait I cannot wait for days for us to even

10:03:35.160 --> 10:03:38.840
Thanks for being so funny amazing and cute you make my day better and all its aspects

10:03:38.920 --> 10:03:43.400
I wish for you and the girls eternal success. Thank you for such kind words

10:03:44.200 --> 10:03:46.680
That's so nice. I'm glad you somehow find me funny

10:03:47.400 --> 10:03:48.600
Um

10:03:48.600 --> 10:03:49.880
because

10:03:49.880 --> 10:03:51.320
Yeah, literally

10:03:51.320 --> 10:03:55.000
Yeah, it's not good. It's it's hard to make jokes. Okay, my first one

10:03:57.480 --> 10:04:03.080
Oh, yeah, there's an official discord that has notification only none of the girls are in it. So

10:04:03.640 --> 10:04:06.680
So remember remember what I said in debut 2.0

10:04:07.560 --> 10:04:09.560
You don't groom us

10:04:10.040 --> 10:04:12.040
We groom you

10:04:12.760 --> 10:04:16.920
So none of us are in it, but if you want notifications for when we go live and all that

10:04:19.480 --> 10:04:23.480
What does it say I need to push you against the wall holding both your hands above your head

10:04:26.760 --> 10:04:29.880
Uh, I'm I supposed to say this that way

10:04:31.320 --> 10:04:33.320
I don't know

10:04:36.040 --> 10:04:40.440
By the way along with the zinc supplements I've started eating celery for you

10:04:40.520 --> 10:04:43.480
Oh celery is minging though. Thanks for your sacrifice

10:04:43.720 --> 10:04:47.160
They taste between boring and bitter and I don't like them by all parts are very

10:04:48.280 --> 10:04:55.560
Are you sure you even I even I draw the line at celery. Sorry. It's so tasteless. I don't understand how it was even

10:04:56.920 --> 10:05:02.440
And that celery has been genetically selected to produce like that

10:05:03.000 --> 10:05:09.160
The only way celery is redeemable is in a soup because it's got stock and completely covers the taste of celery

10:05:10.840 --> 10:05:14.840
Your dedication is appreciated because celery sucks

10:05:16.440 --> 10:05:20.440
Celery is a peanut butter delivery device. Oh, like a spoon

10:05:21.560 --> 10:05:23.560
Celials worse though. Mmm

10:05:24.520 --> 10:05:28.280
That I'm gonna zail them up form down. That's what I remember about

10:05:28.680 --> 10:05:31.480
That's it. Hold on. I'm just grabbing some water

10:05:32.120 --> 10:05:34.120
I I I need some hydrate

10:05:41.160 --> 10:05:44.040
I have been hydrated

10:05:46.680 --> 10:05:51.480
Oh, no, it's 2 p.m. Already. Oh, it's my bedtime soon

10:05:53.640 --> 10:05:59.720
Oh, no, wait. No, actually it's good that it's my bedtime soon because that means I get to be on old school rinse

10:05:59.720 --> 10:06:01.480
game with you even

10:06:01.480 --> 10:06:05.160
Wait, actually, I just realized we're doing a first freaking stream state game tomorrow

10:06:05.320 --> 10:06:07.320
Oh

10:06:07.640 --> 10:06:12.200
Oh my god, why did that not register? We've literally been talking about old school rinse game

10:06:12.200 --> 10:06:15.080
We get to play our first freaking stream today, but I get to see you all

10:06:16.600 --> 10:06:22.440
Oh my god. Okay. I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. Oh my god. It's tomorrow. I want to go to sleep, right?

10:06:22.520 --> 10:06:25.080
I'm not I'm not gonna be able to sleep. It's like christmas

10:06:26.280 --> 10:06:28.280
It's like christmas

10:06:28.520 --> 10:06:30.520
I'm gonna be too excited

10:06:31.080 --> 10:06:36.280
Are we all gonna like have code name? I don't know. Should we have theme names or we're all just gonna name our names like how we are

10:06:38.280 --> 10:06:39.720
Five

10:06:39.720 --> 10:06:44.120
I'm just gonna say this right now. Someone says hopefully you'll play five hours five hours

10:06:44.680 --> 10:06:48.840
No, we're doing 12 hours. Okay 12 hours or go home

10:06:49.080 --> 10:06:53.160
So I'm going to give everyone as much of a chance as possible to show up in old school rinse game

10:06:53.640 --> 10:06:58.120
I will put the world we are on in the top corner or something

10:06:58.360 --> 10:07:00.760
So you can see it any minute. What is runescape?

10:07:01.320 --> 10:07:03.320
Runescape is an old

10:07:04.200 --> 10:07:07.720
Web game. Is that a web game? I don't know if it's a web game now

10:07:08.760 --> 10:07:09.960
um

10:07:09.960 --> 10:07:14.360
Beget if you have trouble falling asleep just look at a mirror and hypnotize yourself true

10:07:16.600 --> 10:07:19.160
I'm aware that's below your average

10:07:20.360 --> 10:07:23.080
The most runescape players average on the game

10:07:23.560 --> 10:07:28.680
Oh, do they they had enough after five hours me just like right. Let's do a fashion show

10:07:28.840 --> 10:07:33.080
Everyone go to the grand exchange and get some pretty clothes on. I'm gonna write who has the best

10:07:34.120 --> 10:07:40.440
Oh, wait, there's houses and can I bring you to my house and runescape? I'm right. I don't know

10:07:41.720 --> 10:07:45.640
How membership works, but I'm pretty sure you can get house and runescape

10:07:46.520 --> 10:07:47.320
um

10:07:47.320 --> 10:07:50.680
Because I remember watching someone play hide and seek in runescape

10:07:50.920 --> 10:07:57.320
And he was like chasing around like the people in stream. We can play hide and seek and taking runescape

10:07:59.240 --> 10:08:01.240
Oh my god

10:08:01.320 --> 10:08:04.680
Yeah, and it has this one's go. Oh my god

10:08:05.640 --> 10:08:07.640
Oh my god, can we play hide and seek?

10:08:08.200 --> 10:08:13.560
I want to be the seeker and I get to touch you all and if you're touched you have to like go in the corner

10:08:13.800 --> 10:08:16.200
Until the winner is crowned

10:08:16.920 --> 10:08:18.920
Really are getting screwed

10:08:19.720 --> 10:08:23.640
I've never played runescape. Well, everything you're describing it sounds very close to ojicob penguin

10:08:25.960 --> 10:08:27.960
Oh my god, I want to play tag

10:08:29.560 --> 10:08:34.280
And I'll be like right run away from didi didi didi. Oh, no, who's that? Oh, no, but we won't be able to know who's that

10:08:34.360 --> 10:08:36.360
So we can all play hide and seek. Okay

10:08:37.160 --> 10:08:39.880
Shawnee if you phrase it like that everyone will like touch them

10:08:41.160 --> 10:08:43.160
No, no, you're not wanting to get caught

10:08:44.120 --> 10:08:47.480
What if we use our runescape beds next to each other ha ha jk

10:08:49.880 --> 10:08:54.440
I sadly can't start a new game. I already have three games that take full time and one of them I play

10:08:55.800 --> 10:08:59.480
Well world of warcraft someone was like, well, I say so

10:09:00.040 --> 10:09:02.920
They were like, I'm no longer doing wow reads to watch your streams

10:09:02.920 --> 10:09:10.120
I'm like, no, your girl's gonna be so annoyed at you. Like I've had the chance to play world of war. Ah, what was the expansion called?

10:09:12.840 --> 10:09:15.560
It was like the second last expansion of wow

10:09:16.440 --> 10:09:21.560
Um, I had a chance to play it and apparently people role play in this place called goldheim

10:09:22.120 --> 10:09:26.840
And I'm like, should we play wow and just like be like really weird roleplayers that

10:09:28.040 --> 10:09:29.320
I'd like

10:09:29.320 --> 10:09:32.680
Shadowlands, I think it's shadowlands is why I played

10:09:33.400 --> 10:09:34.840
um

10:09:34.840 --> 10:09:41.320
No, not the battle not the battle of adedroff. Oh, okay brain needs to catch up. Hold on. Hold on brain needs to catch up

10:09:41.560 --> 10:09:43.560
Not the battle of azaroth

10:09:44.520 --> 10:09:48.840
Gold chart and something like that. Yeah, the gold chart and we should all go role play there

10:09:49.480 --> 10:09:53.640
I would like make like make people really uncomfortable and we're all just like role playing

10:09:55.640 --> 10:09:58.120
Wow ascension is a thing. I don't know what that is

10:09:59.720 --> 10:10:01.720
The the elf and her dwarves. Oh

10:10:04.040 --> 10:10:06.040
Wait, what would we be

10:10:06.680 --> 10:10:13.000
Can I be can I be a cute night elf and then you guys could all be worgens for some unwritten reason

10:10:13.720 --> 10:10:15.720
Mm-hmm

10:10:17.160 --> 10:10:20.600
Pop tropica is still a thing too pop tropica

10:10:22.760 --> 10:10:24.760
Hmm

10:10:25.400 --> 10:10:29.800
Guild wars to role plays where it's ah unknown wink wonk

10:10:31.080 --> 10:10:33.000

Really wink wink

10:10:38.600 --> 10:10:40.600
Did that did that work

10:10:41.560 --> 10:10:48.840
Oh, no, it doesn't work. Wait for some reason the sound works on my freaking game. Hold on. We're like wink wink

10:10:54.280 --> 10:10:58.120
There we go, wait that played twice. I don't know why it doesn't do it on the screen. That's strange

10:10:58.760 --> 10:11:00.760
It's the same instance. Oh, well

10:11:01.400 --> 10:11:03.400
Sorry that took me so long to do

10:11:03.880 --> 10:11:07.560
We should be orcs and you should be an elf for no reason at all

10:11:08.520 --> 10:11:10.920
Oh gee, I sure wouldn't love to be overpowered

10:11:12.360 --> 10:11:15.480
I take a drink of hydration of water to hydrate

10:11:19.400 --> 10:11:25.000
Hi good morrow dear silly cuttlefish. I'm very sleepy. So I'ma be brief

10:11:25.640 --> 10:11:28.360
I absolutely don't watch in here. That's okay. Shame and today

10:11:29.560 --> 10:11:35.080
And it's been so unreal to watch you be all silly again. I absolutely adore you and hope all of you are girls

10:11:36.040 --> 10:11:42.440
And what sorry I absolutely adore you and your hopes for the vealer girls and everything and I hope you all make it happen

10:11:42.520 --> 10:11:47.480
For your happiness is mine and I'm always kicking my feet blushing tapping and stuff. Thank you for making

10:11:49.400 --> 10:11:51.400
Thank you for such kind words

10:11:52.200 --> 10:11:56.680
Got you twirling your hair and stuff. Huh got you twirling your hair and stream

10:11:58.040 --> 10:12:04.280
Are you and the girls ever gonna play minecraft together? Yes, July is when the group minecraft server goes up

10:12:05.080 --> 10:12:06.120
Amy

10:12:06.120 --> 10:12:10.680
Definitely the most minecraft day out of us all. I don't know how the scale goes

10:12:10.760 --> 10:12:15.720
But i'ma confidently say i'm probably the lowest on the scale of like minecraft knowledge

10:12:16.120 --> 10:12:20.040
All I know is that apparently the mob votes

10:12:21.400 --> 10:12:22.280
Are

10:12:22.280 --> 10:12:26.120
They vote people voted for the freaking stealth phantom things

10:12:26.360 --> 10:12:29.960
If you don't sleep for more than two days, they attack you through walls and stuff

10:12:30.360 --> 10:12:35.320
And I know that was the mob vote and apparently the mod vote is also rigged because

10:12:36.040 --> 10:12:38.040
It doesn't make sense

10:12:39.240 --> 10:12:44.200
I don't know but I don't know if it's rigged. I think it's because people don't understand

10:12:45.080 --> 10:12:46.600
like

10:12:46.600 --> 10:12:49.240
kids will vote and kids don't vote for

10:12:50.040 --> 10:12:52.040
things that are like

10:12:53.320 --> 10:12:58.120
Good they vote for what kids want and maybe that's why the votes are always so skewed

10:13:00.600 --> 10:13:03.880
Yeah mob votes terrible. I tried and voted for the crab

10:13:04.600 --> 10:13:06.600
Wasn't there not like an alternative?

10:13:07.000 --> 10:13:10.840
I can't remember. I assume mercy and her motion sickness might be a bit of a struggle

10:13:11.560 --> 10:13:12.840
Yes

10:13:12.840 --> 10:13:14.840
mercy

10:13:15.800 --> 10:13:17.800
I would love

10:13:18.200 --> 10:13:23.640
It's hard. I don't know if minecraft would set it off although she can she can change the camera

10:13:24.280 --> 10:13:26.840
So it might not affect her motion sickness

10:13:27.160 --> 10:13:32.840
I'll need to ask a bit more about it because because I don't have it. I don't know what kind of like sets are off all the time

10:13:33.640 --> 10:13:38.840
Kids running around. I can't believe it kids reeling the way that kids game isn't used terrible

10:13:39.240 --> 10:13:41.960
I hydrate again. Oh my voice is feeling it mr. Krabs

10:13:44.840 --> 10:13:49.560
I'm pretty sure you can move out your camera angle. Can you not on minecraft or am I just making that up?

10:13:50.920 --> 10:13:52.920
They look cool never stuck them forever

10:13:53.640 --> 10:13:56.920
Yeah, I will agree the design of it looked cool

10:13:57.800 --> 10:14:00.200
But its actual thing in game

10:14:01.000 --> 10:14:02.520
is rubbish

10:14:02.520 --> 10:14:04.520
like rubbish

10:14:05.800 --> 10:14:07.800
um

10:14:11.560 --> 10:14:14.360
What does that mean what are you asking me?

10:14:15.160 --> 10:14:22.440
Forgot to send this. Thank you mommy for all your girls. So cute. Oh, I wanted to mention that so many people are like thanking me for like

10:14:23.320 --> 10:14:28.280
The girls being the girls. I'm like, no you thank the girls. I didn't do anything

10:14:29.000 --> 10:14:35.000
If you're thanking me for picking them again, that's the girls that did that. It was through either

10:14:36.200 --> 10:14:37.720
their

10:14:37.720 --> 10:14:44.120
Introduction or their con their own content like it's the girls. It's the girls you should be thanking not me

10:14:44.920 --> 10:14:46.680
Goobers

10:14:46.680 --> 10:14:48.680
It's the girls

10:14:49.080 --> 10:14:51.080
So thank the girl

10:14:51.720 --> 10:14:58.600
The reason people say that the vote is rigged is because Compton created tell people to vote for a certain more of their four effects and vote

10:14:59.720 --> 10:15:04.760
Compton Compton who's Compton sounds like a town in London somewhere

10:15:05.640 --> 10:15:07.800
Or a bottle sorry a bottle in London

10:15:08.680 --> 10:15:12.200
You picked an amazing bunch though. They're all awesome. Ah, I'm glad you agree

10:15:13.160 --> 10:15:15.320
There'd be nothing short of perfect

10:15:16.040 --> 10:15:20.040
As in they are perfect. That's how that's how you say they're perfect, right?

10:15:20.360 --> 10:15:26.840
They're nothing they're they have been nothing but perfect. Yeah, that's how you say it. Yeah, okay. Man of heat angles

10:15:35.080 --> 10:15:41.080
Wait, oh no, right you guys are welcome to laugh. I think this is terminology. I'm not familiar with

10:15:41.800 --> 10:15:43.400
if I see a

10:15:43.480 --> 10:15:45.480
pace tripper

10:15:47.240 --> 10:15:52.360
What's a hololive homo? Oh, what's a knee-gee male? What?

10:15:55.080 --> 10:15:59.560
What's that? Am I being dumb? I don't know what that is

10:16:01.960 --> 10:16:03.640
They're asking

10:16:03.640 --> 10:16:05.640
Do I have am I able to shadow ban them?

10:16:07.480 --> 10:16:12.200
All right, maybe maybe this no maybe this no, I don't quite understand it. Sorry

10:16:13.800 --> 10:16:15.800
Hmm

10:16:19.960 --> 10:16:21.960
Why is someone sending me

10:16:23.080 --> 10:16:25.080
a detailed no

10:16:26.200 --> 10:16:30.200
Is this is this far and on is this toilet bowl far and on

10:16:31.720 --> 10:16:39.480
Oh ye gods how I wish for that most delightful of noise to curl into mine deprived ears with such intensity

10:16:39.560 --> 10:16:41.560
I yearn to experience the sound of

10:16:42.200 --> 10:16:43.560
straw knees

10:16:43.560 --> 10:16:45.560
splutter gutter as it

10:16:46.280 --> 10:16:51.000
Flaps a flutter the noise like a walrus burping up butter

10:16:51.880 --> 10:16:53.240
the parps

10:16:53.240 --> 10:16:55.080
and

10:16:55.080 --> 10:16:57.080
It's like a chorus of

10:16:57.400 --> 10:16:58.920
angels

10:16:58.920 --> 10:17:00.760
unleashing their art

10:17:00.760 --> 10:17:02.040
the pungent

10:17:02.040 --> 10:17:09.400
Bay bass bass that can only be played alongside golden harps to shepherd the dead who has come and died

10:17:09.480 --> 10:17:15.880
When hearing straw knees fart that is so toilet. There's no way you're not toilet bowl and on

10:17:18.760 --> 10:17:20.760
Just for very quick lore

10:17:20.760 --> 10:17:24.200
Someone ages ago sent me a thing and it's like I really want to hear you fart

10:17:24.840 --> 10:17:30.600
On the toilet and I'm like what you want it to be amplified by echoing off the rim of the toilet

10:17:30.920 --> 10:17:35.480
And from then he was crowned freaking toilet as bowl and on

10:17:36.440 --> 10:17:44.040
I don't want to miss what cursed filth at the eye brought upon at the how brought upon these lands

10:17:46.360 --> 10:17:51.240
Hi my love, I want to hmm and me right in front of you while you hold her hand

10:17:52.840 --> 10:17:55.000
You may careful what you wish for you may be getting it

10:17:55.880 --> 10:17:59.000
You may be getting it with all the girls actually possibly

10:18:00.440 --> 10:18:02.440
There's

10:18:03.160 --> 10:18:05.480
Hmm. Yes, I need to I need to see

10:18:08.760 --> 10:18:11.800
He wants to hear the reverb full acoustics literally

10:18:12.840 --> 10:18:14.840
What they wanted to hear that?

10:18:16.200 --> 10:18:18.200
You're only allowed to hold hands

10:18:21.000 --> 10:18:23.400
I have a plan for my own a song

10:18:24.040 --> 10:18:28.200
But it requires a team effort and it's quite a lot to ask the girls like

10:18:28.760 --> 10:18:33.400
Oh Dota songs are like you need to help each other out type them, but I'm gonna try my best to make it as easy as possible

10:18:34.280 --> 10:18:37.640
but I would like to release a certain audio and

10:18:39.000 --> 10:18:41.000
basically

10:18:41.240 --> 10:18:45.880
In it, I give you a pill that negates any need for a

10:18:47.000 --> 10:18:49.000
pause champ if you will

10:18:49.720 --> 10:18:51.960
And then I take you daughter by daughter

10:18:53.320 --> 10:18:55.320
It's so messed up saying out loud

10:18:56.040 --> 10:19:00.760
But yeah, and I tell you like all the good things and encourage

10:19:07.480 --> 10:19:11.720
But I don't I I need to I need to let it cook. Okay. I need to let it cook

10:19:12.360 --> 10:19:15.720
And I need a donut on in the first place to even start cooking up

10:19:16.520 --> 10:19:19.320
But wait in there. Yeah, we ain't doing that. We weren't even on the apart

10:19:20.840 --> 10:19:22.840
That's a very silly pill

10:19:22.920 --> 10:19:27.240
Lord grant me strength. Would you please give us a heads up for when it comes out so we can see?

10:19:28.680 --> 10:19:30.680
Oh my god, mon

10:19:31.960 --> 10:19:33.400
Please do that

10:19:33.400 --> 10:19:35.400
She kicked a whole six course dinner

10:19:36.600 --> 10:19:38.600
I'm a gourmet chef

10:19:38.760 --> 10:19:40.760
Well, if I get 99

10:19:40.920 --> 10:19:44.600
Um cooking on runescape, then yes, I am a chef

10:19:45.400 --> 10:19:46.760
confirmed

10:19:46.760 --> 10:19:51.080
Any plans for haptic support? Ah, I keep I keep getting asked, but I don't know what it is

10:19:51.160 --> 10:19:53.880
I don't know what I need to do to the audience to make that happen

10:19:54.840 --> 10:19:59.320
I don't know if it's like I run it through a data thing or whoa. I don't know

10:20:01.400 --> 10:20:03.400
I'm too dumb

10:20:04.280 --> 10:20:08.040
Hold on. I'm gonna fix my calibration and I'm wiggling a bit too much

10:20:12.280 --> 10:20:14.280
Okay calibration calibrate

10:20:15.960 --> 10:20:19.160
Are we cooking an own school runescape something? Yes

10:20:19.880 --> 10:20:24.920
I don't know how to make money in runescape, but we're gonna be buying lobster so we can level up

10:20:25.480 --> 10:20:30.760
If not, we'll use barbarian village and we'll pick up all the salmon that all the bots drop

10:20:33.960 --> 10:20:38.120
Shawnee, do you reply to marshmallows privately? No, um, I don't

10:20:39.400 --> 10:20:42.760
I reply on stream or I put together a mosaic

10:20:43.400 --> 10:20:47.480
A mosaic? Is that the correct word where I put all the pictures together

10:20:48.440 --> 10:20:50.120
I'm posting

10:20:50.120 --> 10:20:53.720
But I've only done that once I should maybe do it again sometime

10:20:54.680 --> 10:20:57.080
And then I can talk about all the naughty things

10:20:58.280 --> 10:21:00.280
Wow

10:21:01.720 --> 10:21:06.040
Here's a funny story about three medieval kingdoms. I'm scared to click as a piece but

10:21:08.920 --> 10:21:10.760
What?

10:21:10.760 --> 10:21:16.120
Hey, story. I love your work. Any chance to do a belly button counting? No, you don't like to see my belly button

10:21:16.200 --> 10:21:19.000
Why would you want to see my belly button? I don't like my belly button

10:21:19.800 --> 10:21:21.800
belly button

10:21:21.800 --> 10:21:23.800
belly button

10:21:24.360 --> 10:21:26.360
Is that your choice?

10:21:26.360 --> 10:21:28.360
Is that your choice of finishing location?

10:21:29.160 --> 10:21:31.160
Hmm

10:21:31.160 --> 10:21:33.160
Your choice interesting

10:21:35.960 --> 10:21:38.840
Good night, Shawnee. Just thought you'd want to know I'm gonna jet. Oh

10:21:40.360 --> 10:21:44.120
I can't read the end of that. Uh, enjoy your night time routine. Sleep well

10:21:44.840 --> 10:21:47.880
Uh, oh my oh my

10:21:50.440 --> 10:21:53.400
Uh, hi, Shawnee. I want to hold your body again

10:21:58.360 --> 10:22:00.360
Oh

10:22:01.800 --> 10:22:03.800
I can't read any of these

10:22:03.800 --> 10:22:07.880
There's a free game called fantasy star online too. I haven't played it in years

10:22:07.960 --> 10:22:11.080
But every weekend there's a hatsunimiku con that's so specific

10:22:11.080 --> 10:22:14.200
Why is there a hatsunimiku concert in the middle of fantasy star online too?

10:22:15.160 --> 10:22:17.160
I'm thinking

10:22:21.160 --> 10:22:25.160
You air blue eyes hiding in your wi-fi

10:22:25.960 --> 10:22:30.920
Shawnee just want to let you know for old school runescape being on a members world is almost a requirement for any skill training

10:22:30.920 --> 10:22:36.360
You can quest together with people and free to play but the gameplay is limited. Oh, but it's so expensive

10:22:37.240 --> 10:22:39.240
Oh

10:22:39.640 --> 10:22:41.640
Stop reading them out loud

10:22:42.200 --> 10:22:44.120
By like reading them

10:22:44.120 --> 10:22:47.000
It's only me or is it me saying a lot more

10:22:49.080 --> 10:22:51.080
Things than she do

10:22:52.440 --> 10:22:56.520
Hey, are they both on? No, they're not online right now. You mean in the ASMRs?

10:22:57.000 --> 10:22:59.000
I don't know

10:23:03.160 --> 10:23:07.400
People are bored bold on marshmallow. Yeah, that's the best part

10:23:08.440 --> 10:23:10.680
They tell me everything they want

10:23:11.480 --> 10:23:14.120
And I give them everything they want

10:23:15.160 --> 10:23:17.160
That's a good exchange

10:23:20.040 --> 10:23:22.040
Can you please say

10:23:22.600 --> 10:23:24.600
um

10:23:25.000 --> 10:23:27.320
What are you gonna use it for if I say it?

10:23:29.000 --> 10:23:31.640
And you didn't tell me what tone to say it in either

10:23:34.120 --> 10:23:37.240
You didn't tell me what tone to say the sentence in either

10:23:38.440 --> 10:23:42.520
Hmm, I need to think how would you want me to say it?

10:23:44.680 --> 10:23:46.680
Hmm, I lost the game

10:23:47.720 --> 10:23:49.880
This is that the tone you wanted it?

10:23:50.280 --> 10:23:57.400
If you want me to say something you need to give me tone. You need to give me the emotion. I don't know

10:24:07.080 --> 10:24:09.640
Wait, strong enough wait what?

10:24:13.480 --> 10:24:17.400
Wait, is that that giffy game where if someone says you lost the game

10:24:17.640 --> 10:24:19.640
You've lost us

10:24:20.440 --> 10:24:22.440
Wait, is that what it

10:24:22.760 --> 10:24:25.000
Rip game players wait, what does that mean?

10:24:25.880 --> 10:24:31.560
It's a silly game right where people say I lost the game and then you lose it until you win it on your streak

10:24:32.360 --> 10:24:34.520
If you think about the game you lost, okay

10:24:36.520 --> 10:24:39.640
The only objective of the game is to not think about the game. Oh

10:24:41.320 --> 10:24:47.320
Okay, oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I just made you all lose. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking that

10:24:48.360 --> 10:24:50.360
I'm sorry

10:24:51.080 --> 10:24:53.080
I didn't think that forehead

10:24:55.240 --> 10:24:59.160
Can I suggest something secret totally say so confession maros to read on stream?

10:24:59.240 --> 10:25:02.120
Yeah, you can like you can literally type in the maros right now. Do I have

10:25:03.240 --> 10:25:05.240
Can I can I send it like this?

10:25:06.280 --> 10:25:07.880
Did that work it did?

10:25:07.880 --> 10:25:13.320
Yeah, you can just put it in there and if you want me to say something just put the emotion and then like little quotation marks

10:25:13.720 --> 10:25:16.120
I'll also take requests here in the ASMR stream as well

10:25:16.200 --> 10:25:22.120
So if you ever wanted me to hear it kind of whispered a bit on on a different microphone because this is an asm b7. I'm using

10:25:24.840 --> 10:25:30.120
At least we lost this drawing. I heard about this like 25 years ago an elementary

10:25:31.480 --> 10:25:36.200
My discipline. I'm sorry. Okay. I distract you. I will say other things

10:25:36.200 --> 10:25:42.440
Did you see the reefing zip-up hoodie design Mario? I send on their deer. What do we bear?

10:25:43.080 --> 10:25:46.920
Oh, if you've got those if you've got those kind of pictures, please send on twitter

10:25:47.320 --> 10:25:50.200
But I will say my twitter tags are freaking working

10:25:50.840 --> 10:25:52.840
I'm trying to find

10:25:52.840 --> 10:25:59.080
This freaking artwork on smuttle and it doesn't show up. I don't know why it doesn't show up

10:26:02.360 --> 10:26:05.720
Uh, what's your favorite type of hypnotic induction to use?

10:26:07.000 --> 10:26:09.000
um

10:26:09.160 --> 10:26:11.160
I think

10:26:12.920 --> 10:26:14.920
I like repeated pattern

10:26:15.240 --> 10:26:19.480
Come to the ASMR stream and I'll show you what I like. Okay deal

10:26:20.760 --> 10:26:23.320
Huh, are you gonna show up and I'll show you what I like

10:26:24.440 --> 10:26:28.440
She went like and people are gonna judge me, but I like it

10:26:29.080 --> 10:26:30.840
So I'll do what I like

10:26:30.840 --> 10:26:32.840
Sometimes the stony is a good girl. Hell yeah

10:26:33.080 --> 10:26:35.080
Yeah

10:26:35.400 --> 10:26:41.960
You uh, I'm good at advertising. Okay. I'm in I'm in. Hey stony. Here's the soft safer work Mario. Do you have a throne?

10:26:42.760 --> 10:26:46.360
I do but I've unlinked it because

10:26:48.360 --> 10:26:53.320
I have everything I need now that I've got my reef links. I don't need a single thing else

10:26:55.400 --> 10:26:57.800
Hmm and that's that

10:26:57.800 --> 10:26:59.800
I

10:27:00.120 --> 10:27:02.600
Don't need anything so I've unlinked my throne

10:27:04.120 --> 10:27:06.120
I'm gonna say how many

10:27:06.360 --> 10:27:08.360
Have you received so far? Um

10:27:09.400 --> 10:27:11.720
Not a lot the girls are getting a lot more than me

10:27:12.840 --> 10:27:16.120
I think the refunds are a little shy a little shy or a little scared

10:27:17.160 --> 10:27:21.720
Well, you and the girls be able to mhm yourself and members streams. Uh, most likely yes

10:27:23.480 --> 10:27:26.200
Stony doesn't make you happen people send you the spicy messages

10:27:28.200 --> 10:27:31.160
Please let me please tell me all the scenarios you want to do to me

10:27:37.320 --> 10:27:41.400
Are there any games where there's an alt path you haven't tried and would you consider them?

10:27:43.000 --> 10:27:45.000
I can't think of any off the top of my head

10:27:45.480 --> 10:27:51.640
I normally probably like game starts game ends. I never pick the bad team if there's a bad side

10:27:52.200 --> 10:27:54.200
stinky

10:27:54.840 --> 10:27:57.800
Unless you count the companions in Skyrim

10:28:02.440 --> 10:28:05.080
Does anyone here like the companions in Skyrim?

10:28:06.440 --> 10:28:12.040
Oh wait, I'm on the freaking wrong thing. Sorry. Hold on. Let me do that again. Does anyone here like the companions in Skyrim?

10:28:15.400 --> 10:28:18.680
Yeah, exactly. That's what I thought that's what I thought no one likes them

10:28:19.640 --> 10:28:24.760
Yeah, boo exactly

10:28:26.840 --> 10:28:28.440
You think they're fine

10:28:28.440 --> 10:28:33.320
I don't I never although the first time you play it. It's like wow really good, but

10:28:34.120 --> 10:28:36.920
The freaking on xbox

10:28:37.640 --> 10:28:42.760
The girl always glitches out and disappears in the middle of the map and she never comes back

10:28:44.360 --> 10:28:46.360
Hi, just a time waster for cute fish

10:28:48.840 --> 10:28:50.440
Someone says

10:28:50.440 --> 10:28:52.440
So this is wife

10:28:52.440 --> 10:28:54.440
husband

10:28:57.000 --> 10:28:59.720
Have you heard a joke about afar it stinks

10:29:01.000 --> 10:29:03.000
You know what you're done

10:29:07.160 --> 10:29:09.160
Why do I hate you no work?

10:29:19.640 --> 10:29:21.640
Oh

10:29:21.720 --> 10:29:28.440
Right, I think that's all the marshmallows that I can I I refresh and it's just gone up like a bit

10:29:31.560 --> 10:29:33.560
Um

10:29:33.560 --> 10:29:37.400
Oh my god, I love you and the girls so much. I created a twitter account just to follow the six year

10:29:37.400 --> 10:29:41.000
I hate I had to turn into I know. Thank you for going through it

10:29:41.000 --> 10:29:44.760
It's such a pain my account keeps getting freaking locked and it keeps making me prove

10:29:44.840 --> 10:29:47.960
I'm not bought over and over and over and over and over and over and over again

10:29:48.440 --> 10:29:50.440
Look, I just want to look at small fish. I want to

10:29:51.080 --> 10:29:53.080
And then I want to go to sleep, you know what I'm saying

10:29:53.880 --> 10:29:57.800
Hi Johnny. Oh, sorry. I don't know why I gave you that voice. I'm so sorry. I apologize

10:29:58.360 --> 10:30:04.360
Hi, strongy. I woke up in a Euro time zone and found out the party was still going 10 hours in the avatar stream

10:30:05.160 --> 10:30:09.240
Yeah, I really admire your energy and autism as you call it. Thank you

10:30:09.720 --> 10:30:13.480
If you want to play old school runescape tomorrow, we are going to be live for 12 hours

10:30:13.800 --> 10:30:15.640
Cheeky endurance stream

10:30:15.640 --> 10:30:17.000
What's that?

10:30:17.000 --> 10:30:20.760
I stream more in one week than the average wee chipper does in a month

10:30:21.400 --> 10:30:23.400
I'll wear that with pride

10:30:26.280 --> 10:30:30.920
Hmm, so I I don't I don't have snot coming out my nose. I'm drinking water

10:30:35.880 --> 10:30:37.880
Yeah, wishes

10:30:38.520 --> 10:30:40.520
Hi strongy. Thanks for being a butt so

10:30:41.480 --> 10:30:46.200
Okay, you can you can finish the rest

10:30:50.840 --> 10:30:56.120
Strongy guess what you just took my marshmallow marshmallow of engineering get plapped get plapped get plapped

10:30:57.080 --> 10:31:01.640
Looking forward to the old school runescape. I also recommend final fantasy if you want more mmo's also

10:31:01.880 --> 10:31:05.960
Would you accept script ideas family scripts? Yes, I would I don't have a problem

10:31:06.920 --> 10:31:13.400
Um, there may at a later date not now not in this month things need to settle where um

10:31:14.680 --> 10:31:16.680
We can take official script submissions

10:31:16.680 --> 10:31:22.840
However, if veal or where to take like subscriptions it submissions for audios

10:31:23.560 --> 10:31:25.000
purposes

10:31:25.000 --> 10:31:30.520
Sadly, you have to fully hand over the rights. So we have the right to monetize. We have ownership

10:31:30.840 --> 10:31:32.840
We're happy to give credit. Um

10:31:33.560 --> 10:31:39.640
I think I don't know if there's gonna be a problem given credit. I haven't thought that far ahead at the moment, but

10:31:40.760 --> 10:31:43.560
There's a lot of issues and it's quite a shame

10:31:44.040 --> 10:31:47.000
And it's really hard to iron out at this point in time

10:31:47.080 --> 10:31:51.480
But once the dust settles and things get a bit better wait get plapped. What are you doing to this?

10:31:55.000 --> 10:32:00.520
Do you still have love for the big boy reeflings out there I couldn't help but notice a line in your lore video

10:32:03.720 --> 10:32:05.720
Yes

10:32:07.800 --> 10:32:12.040
And there's just something I've got to say you're as beautiful as the day I lost you oh

10:32:12.920 --> 10:32:14.600
Thank you

10:32:14.600 --> 10:32:18.440
That's the how to train your dragon. That's one of the only books I read as a child

10:32:18.680 --> 10:32:23.160
I think I read like three books as a childhood and one of them was how to train your dragon

10:32:24.360 --> 10:32:27.560
I don't know how I read a book honestly, but I did it

10:32:27.880 --> 10:32:29.880
Hmm

10:32:30.200 --> 10:32:31.560
She's

10:32:31.560 --> 10:32:33.560
dunking us in the water

10:32:34.280 --> 10:32:37.720
The books were so good. Literally one of the only books I read as a child

10:32:37.880 --> 10:32:42.920
I've read more books this year than I have in my entire life, which is crazy

10:32:43.720 --> 10:32:45.720
crazy

10:32:45.720 --> 10:32:48.600
I'd pretend that I can do a book review. So I'm not even smart enough for that

10:32:48.680 --> 10:32:53.000
I'm currently trying to get through the handmaidens tale. I actually am enjoying the handmaidens tale

10:32:53.240 --> 10:32:58.040
I'm like a few chapters in but I I don't know if people find this cheating

10:32:58.440 --> 10:33:01.480
But I have to have the book read to me or I can't read it

10:33:02.680 --> 10:33:06.520
I this sounds really bad, but it takes up too much brain power to read the words

10:33:07.080 --> 10:33:11.320
manually, so I read along whilst being spoken to by tts voice

10:33:12.760 --> 10:33:18.120
And no and I can speed it up like super fast. Oh, thank you for the raid

10:33:19.240 --> 10:33:21.240
How did your stream go?

10:33:22.200 --> 10:33:28.600
How did your stream go rain? Oh, you might be tired. So don't feel forced to talk. Don't feel forced to talk if you're a tired little barbie

10:33:30.200 --> 10:33:34.200
Hey barbie, I should have said background music. It's like really quiet in the stream. I don't know if it's

10:33:34.760 --> 10:33:36.760
Maybe nice. I hope your stream was good

10:33:37.560 --> 10:33:42.760
Endurance streamer creative director and so has time. I've not read any books since debut. I can show you that much

10:33:43.080 --> 10:33:47.960
But hi raiders. I'm strong and cut loose from violour. I'm really inappropriate

10:33:47.960 --> 10:33:53.160
So I do apologize if I know your cup of tea and I'm also Scottish so I'm super hard to understand but thank for hanging out anyway

10:33:55.320 --> 10:33:59.160
Which is I hope your stream went fantastic. Please rest up after your stream

10:33:59.160 --> 10:34:04.040
I'm sure you're tired and last thing you want to do is get bombarded with loads of questions from the person

10:34:04.040 --> 10:34:07.560
You have kindly rated into so I thank you kindly rain cloud

10:34:08.040 --> 10:34:11.400
And I hope you have a fantastic rest after your

10:34:12.280 --> 10:34:13.880
game

10:34:13.880 --> 10:34:15.880
Game maybe that too

10:34:16.280 --> 10:34:19.000
Never know may not be a game. She may not be has to um

10:34:20.680 --> 10:34:23.560
Entry all in one breath. She's got lungs. Hey

10:34:25.320 --> 10:34:31.160
Strongly looking to push 11 hours at this rate. Should we should we just yap and then make it another 12 hours?

10:34:33.080 --> 10:34:36.280
Why is the raid message wait wait? I saw it as weight as well

10:34:36.520 --> 10:34:40.520
Like I could hardly read but I had to scroll over. I mean if I make another cup of tea

10:34:41.320 --> 10:34:43.640
We could in theory make it 12 hours again

10:34:44.040 --> 10:34:47.640
And we just like and we can just talk and I can ask you questions

10:34:47.720 --> 10:34:50.920
And then you ask me questions and then I'm going to ramble about something

10:34:51.560 --> 10:34:53.560
And then you distract me

10:34:53.560 --> 10:34:55.560
And then we're going to another ramble

10:34:55.880 --> 10:35:03.000
Do you want that? Yes, please? Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Her favorite form of introduction is tying you until you can't help but fall asleep

10:35:03.400 --> 10:35:05.160
They happen a

10:35:05.160 --> 10:35:09.800
You feel yourself getting so asleep. They don't know what we're playing. Yeah

10:35:11.160 --> 10:35:13.160
It's okay

10:35:13.640 --> 10:35:16.440
Let's sleep and brace you slowly

10:35:17.320 --> 10:35:19.320
Okay

10:35:23.320 --> 10:35:30.040
And then here for 13 and then 14 I mark my words when and if youtube ever fixed vods

10:35:30.840 --> 10:35:34.840
14 hour streams not even kidding. You can't I can't get enough of you

10:35:35.720 --> 10:35:37.720
I can't I can't get enough of you

10:35:38.280 --> 10:35:41.320
And when we do Elden Ring, I am incredibly

10:35:43.000 --> 10:35:45.000
I'm incredibly tempted

10:35:45.400 --> 10:35:47.240
to possibly

10:35:47.240 --> 10:35:52.680
Figuratively do a 12 hour and then raid into a six hour afterwards. I don't know

10:35:54.120 --> 10:35:57.480
It's plausible. I'll be a tired bean. I don't know

10:35:58.600 --> 10:36:02.680
I wish we could get 14 hours 14 is the like perfect slot of like I can

10:36:03.240 --> 10:36:05.240
Still get a full night's rest

10:36:06.760 --> 10:36:12.920
Lord inject the scottish lass lord if you can hear me right now inject the scottish lass into my veins

10:36:14.200 --> 10:36:18.520
This cult fish is too powerful. Thank god. It's daytime where I live. I don't have to sleep

10:36:19.240 --> 10:36:21.240
Stop I can't be more addicted

10:36:21.480 --> 10:36:23.480
Than I am you're too good strong

10:36:25.880 --> 10:36:27.880
I'm coming for you

10:36:28.120 --> 10:36:34.120
I'm trying to kill us. Thank you. Do rest if you need to rest never worry. Okay

10:36:35.320 --> 10:36:38.920
Johnny I've got go to sleep. Can you please show us those pretty pink swirls? Oh

Now that I'm so close to you. I absolutely can

10:36:43.160 --> 10:36:49.480
Uh, well I go and wow I'm reacting to myself. Please don't react there. Okay. That's more like me

10:36:49.480 --> 10:36:52.440
Hold on. Let me put chat behind me just for a moment

10:36:53.400 --> 10:36:58.680
Okay, let's see if I can do this problem. Hi. Sorry. I'm so close

10:37:00.440 --> 10:37:07.560
Okay, let me move my water out of the way. So I can at least attempt to do something mildly professional for once in my life. Okay

10:37:08.840 --> 10:37:11.720
Once in my life I did something a little bit or maybe a little bit

10:37:12.440 --> 10:37:21.080
It's okay to be sleepy

10:37:23.000 --> 10:37:25.000
It's been a while since

10:37:26.840 --> 10:37:30.120
You've rested well reply. Okay

10:37:35.800 --> 10:37:38.520

10:37:38.760 --> 10:37:42.760
Slow slow slow

10:37:46.040 --> 10:37:52.840
And your muscles relax slow slow slow

10:37:55.960 --> 10:38:04.360
And your brain is quiet slow slow slow

10:38:04.680 --> 10:38:12.520
Good night. That's what we've been waiting for. Until the morning

10:38:18.600 --> 10:38:20.840
Did I do it did I do it right?

10:38:22.280 --> 10:38:24.280
Slow slow slow

10:38:25.240 --> 10:38:27.240
Into the slumber you fall

10:38:29.080 --> 10:38:31.080
I don't know if I was too close because I'm like, oh

10:38:34.520 --> 10:38:37.320
But I need to show up. Seems like you did

10:38:40.040 --> 10:38:43.560
A little sleepy moment. Thank you so much. Good night

10:38:47.240 --> 10:38:53.720
Slow slow slow. I just woke up. Can I put you to sleep again?

10:38:57.640 --> 10:38:59.640
You did great good girl. Yeah

10:39:00.600 --> 10:39:05.880
You can't catch me off guard. I've already been called good girl. Good luck. Get me in subspace. I'm in dumb space

10:39:05.880 --> 10:39:08.680
When I do hypnosis, I feel very dumb

10:39:13.720 --> 10:39:20.520
It's early in the morning. We need a bedtime ASMR. Absolutely. I am more than open to that. We can absolutely do bedtime ASMR

10:39:21.480 --> 10:39:27.880
Um, am I allowed to go for a tinkle and a cup of tea as my voice is cooking like a frog?

10:39:28.360 --> 10:39:33.480
Um, and then we'll just ramble until the 12 hours. Does that sound like a deal?

10:39:37.080 --> 10:39:39.080
You made my boss fall asleep

10:39:45.000 --> 10:39:52.760

Some reason it shows marshmallows from like a week ago at the top. I don't know what that means

10:51:21.400 --> 10:51:25.400
Does that mean someone's verified is like put it up there on purpose? I don't know how it works

10:51:28.040 --> 10:51:34.280
Oh, my stream disconnected. Why does obs do that? I said obs disconnected. I'm still here

Ravioli in a seductive

10:52:08.120 --> 10:52:09.880
ravioli

10:52:09.880 --> 10:52:11.560
ravioli

10:52:11.560 --> 10:52:13.560
ravioli

10:52:14.280 --> 10:52:19.320
That little sleep hypnosis thing you did was amazing and convinced you'd be amazing at a meditation type sleep audio

10:52:19.480 --> 10:52:23.880
Yes, I want to do like bedtime hypnosis stuff as well like completely like fine

10:52:24.520 --> 10:52:25.640
On the table

10:52:25.640 --> 10:52:30.360
You haven't even started your hypo content yet and you're already I'm portraying my mind by turning my

10:52:31.080 --> 10:52:36.200
internal monologue scoffs. I can't wait for you to turn my brain into your

10:52:36.680 --> 10:52:38.680
Ben

10:52:39.000 --> 10:52:41.640
Into your female doll. Oh my

10:52:43.240 --> 10:52:49.480
Ever since you've debuted I've gone from a man lost in the desert drying of thirst to one drowning in a flood of non-stop good times

10:52:50.200 --> 10:52:51.240
Yes

10:52:51.240 --> 10:52:54.440
And all I want to do is just close my eyes and let the waves take me

10:52:55.000 --> 10:52:59.880
Would you drag me into the depths? I want you to I'm glad you can have good times here

10:53:00.520 --> 10:53:03.480
It was it was dry for a while, but I hope

10:53:04.440 --> 10:53:06.840
I hope it's good times here good vibes

10:53:07.400 --> 10:53:13.400
Yeah, we go swimming together, you know, I don't I playfully dunk your head under the water a little bit

10:53:13.640 --> 10:53:15.960
Just playfully and no other reason

10:53:16.920 --> 10:53:18.920
No other lower related reason

10:53:20.920 --> 10:53:25.640
It was awfully cold in the depths, but now we're in warmer waters. I think you could say

10:53:28.600 --> 10:53:31.400
Can you run from prime minister of Australia? So at least they're

10:53:32.280 --> 10:53:39.000
If it's bad ideas, it sounds nice coming from me, but I've not even been granted rights into the country yet

10:53:40.120 --> 10:53:42.120
There there is a timeline

10:53:42.360 --> 10:53:44.360
Where I get rejected

10:53:44.440 --> 10:53:48.040
And I can't I have to go back to Scotland and I can't run the business

10:53:48.600 --> 10:53:51.800
Let's hope we're not on that timeline. That would be terrible

10:53:53.240 --> 10:53:56.120
Could you imagine if I got kicked out? Oh my god

10:54:02.360 --> 10:54:04.360
Oh

10:54:04.440 --> 10:54:09.240
All right. Hi, scrawny. I don't know if it's been answered already. It's okay to ask something. You're not sure that's been answered

10:54:09.560 --> 10:54:14.760
It's not possible for someone to be here all the time. So please don't ever be afraid to ask a question

10:54:14.760 --> 10:54:20.040
You think that's already been answered. It's not possible for you to be here all the time. I know

10:54:20.520 --> 10:54:22.520
I know it's terrible

10:54:24.200 --> 10:54:28.200
Sorry if you did, but I just want to know if you're interested in the game lost planet too

10:54:28.280 --> 10:54:31.960
It's on xbox and I think you'd like it could easily play the whole thing in one stream

10:54:31.960 --> 10:54:39.320
Also, you play delton ring. Would you be open to playing armor core six armor core six has been popping up over

10:54:40.520 --> 10:54:45.880
I've heard the name a few times now. I love your streams that I can't wait to bounce those hypnotic eyes back on you

10:54:47.720 --> 10:54:49.720
Stinky

10:54:50.680 --> 10:54:54.280
Armor core six, I don't know what it is but it keeps coming up

10:54:55.080 --> 10:55:00.520
Lost planet too. I should actually write down game ideas because I I trust your guys's like

10:55:01.400 --> 10:55:04.440
Suggestions over anything that I could possibly come up with

10:55:05.960 --> 10:55:07.320
Um

10:55:07.320 --> 10:55:10.600
AC six is phenomenal. It's great. It's really good

10:55:11.320 --> 10:55:13.320
highly rated game

10:55:14.280 --> 10:55:16.200
Oh my

10:55:16.200 --> 10:55:18.200
every scrawny tone has

10:55:18.840 --> 10:55:23.560
Instruct know my default like I feel like my default like I'm like that and I'm all monotone

10:55:23.640 --> 10:55:29.240
Like you can't even understand lost planet two is an og xbox game. How did I never come across it then?

10:55:30.520 --> 10:55:34.120
I don't know when it came out. Maybe it was still at the stage where like

10:55:35.160 --> 10:55:40.120
So I used to get attached to one game and when Assassin's Creed brotherhood came out like I hardly got any new games

10:55:40.200 --> 10:55:42.200
I've got skyrim. I got

10:55:43.160 --> 10:55:46.280
Black ops ac brotherhood

10:55:47.480 --> 10:55:51.080
The rate of like new games like went down astronomical

10:55:51.880 --> 10:55:54.280
If it's probes of 2006 2008

10:55:56.760 --> 10:55:59.160
And then armor core six

10:55:59.560 --> 10:56:04.360
I'll definitely these these games keep coming up and I trust your guys's judgment. Hi, shawnee

10:56:04.360 --> 10:56:06.760
I was curious if you they fall guys. Let's chat one day

10:56:07.400 --> 10:56:13.640
Uh, yeah, of course, we're doing the jelly bean game. Are you silly? Are you being a silly sausage?

10:56:13.720 --> 10:56:15.880
Of course, we're playing the jelly bean game again

10:56:17.560 --> 10:56:20.520
I'm also you gonna touch me and grab me and hold me back

10:56:23.640 --> 10:56:27.880
You guys wouldn't stop grabbing me you all grab me

10:56:28.920 --> 10:56:30.920
You stinky stinkerton

10:56:31.320 --> 10:56:35.880
Ah, my calibration's having a hard time today. Hold on. Let me recalibrate

10:56:37.720 --> 10:56:40.520
Wow, hopefully my mouth stops wiggling

10:56:43.000 --> 10:56:45.000
Okay, it's not wiggling anymore

10:56:45.160 --> 10:56:47.000
Jelly bean game

10:56:47.000 --> 10:56:52.040
We do what so in the jelly bean game you can like grab opponents and hold them back

10:56:52.520 --> 10:56:55.960
To like stop them from jumping to the objective or whatever

10:56:56.440 --> 10:57:00.040
And I used to have to beg I was so bad at the game

10:57:00.600 --> 10:57:02.600
I would basically have to beg

10:57:03.240 --> 10:57:07.800
To people would hold back to let me through the first level

10:57:08.360 --> 10:57:13.160
Because I ended up losing it so many times that I wasn't playing the game

10:57:13.240 --> 10:57:17.400
And I was spectating you guys play because I was that freaking bad at the game

10:57:17.960 --> 10:57:19.960
That is so much fun

10:57:20.680 --> 10:57:26.040
So yes, you will absolutely be playing that again. I will always do like a

10:57:27.480 --> 10:57:29.480
A stream snip game every month

10:57:29.560 --> 10:57:31.640
Um one that's like public and one

10:57:32.520 --> 10:57:35.080
I do prioritize free to play games

10:57:35.560 --> 10:57:37.560
Unfortunately, I've started off with runescoop

10:57:38.520 --> 10:57:42.840
Which normally premium is the only way to play it. So I've picked a bit pearly

10:57:43.800 --> 10:57:47.000
I do apologize, but I would like to get 99 cooking

10:57:47.560 --> 10:57:50.040
And it would be fun to kind of like achieve goals along the way

10:57:51.000 --> 10:57:55.640
Still going strong good old strongy strongy. What type of fan are you like the most?

10:57:55.960 --> 10:57:57.960

They basically made a scottish beam come out of my mouth and like the first panel was me going

10:58:22.840 --> 10:58:24.840
And then the second panel was like

10:58:25.320 --> 10:58:28.760
I was like throwing this scottish beam out of my mouth and it reminded me

10:58:28.840 --> 10:58:33.400
There's a trend in hatsu miko world and she goes miko no no this time

10:58:34.200 --> 10:58:39.320
You've been waiting for c2 one miko miko beam and it reminded me of that

Um, it is so good like whatever you enjoy like if you enjoy me make a meme if you enjoy the other side of things

10:58:45.880 --> 10:58:49.640

Stroney any chance of you making a 2d platform video game in the food? That's so specific

10:59:17.480 --> 10:59:20.440
Why are you wanting to bounce on me in 2d?

I'm I'm not making a video game. No

10:59:25.480 --> 10:59:30.200

11:00:49.000 --> 11:00:55.880
Someone says I kneel you are too powerful so much kneeling. I like it do it again

11:00:57.960 --> 11:01:01.960
It is humbling to know someone like you exist. I've never dumped so much

11:01:02.440 --> 11:01:06.600
Ink before within a span of a week

11:01:07.800 --> 11:01:13.640
And from it so happy from watching you and the girls. I hope for your success and it's one of the few I feel that is deserved

11:01:13.960 --> 11:01:17.560
Oh, thank you so much. Thank you for spilling your ink

11:01:18.280 --> 11:01:24.040
I do like hearing about ink spilling like why yes, maybe I am a v sucky after all

11:01:26.280 --> 11:01:28.280
Maybe there is sucky by blood

11:01:29.640 --> 11:01:31.640
The pause after hearing

11:01:32.840 --> 11:01:39.480
Where I live it smells like freshly baked cookies because I'm near a cookie factory and I'm and I'm already awake for today

11:01:39.480 --> 11:01:42.920
I'm still going strong. Oh, that's dangerous for your health

11:01:43.080 --> 11:01:47.320
It's dangerous to be awake for more than like 16 hours. I think is when

11:01:48.520 --> 11:01:54.760
It's bad like it's your brain function. Your cognitive function goes down like big big

11:01:54.840 --> 11:01:56.840
I

11:01:57.320 --> 11:02:00.520
Knew it. Well velar is going to be my oval

11:02:01.240 --> 11:02:04.440
My version of meet the grams will be meet the indulgers

11:02:05.240 --> 11:02:12.360
What did you think about the generation name indulge because if I told you technique if I told you a secret

11:02:12.440 --> 11:02:15.160
This is a secret for only who watch the stream right now

11:02:16.440 --> 11:02:17.480
um

11:02:17.480 --> 11:02:20.920
Jen one's name indulge plays into gen two and three

11:02:21.720 --> 11:02:24.760
Um, and if we do get to three gens

11:02:26.280 --> 11:02:33.080
Oh, I'm gonna be so excited because to reveal the full names because they all play into each other

11:02:34.760 --> 11:02:36.760
Uh

11:02:36.840 --> 11:02:43.160
I'm so excited. I wonder if anyone could guess that I don't I think it's impossible to get there's too many variations like

11:02:44.440 --> 11:02:48.600
Someone says is there a chance for a stream of a software game other than elden brain?

11:02:49.480 --> 11:02:54.520
I don't think I can get any help in the other elden rings though. However, I think

11:02:55.640 --> 11:02:58.680
She be as interested in blood-borne

11:03:02.840 --> 11:03:09.480
But unfortunately, I'm not very good and the reason I like elden ring so much is because you guys can come in and help me

11:03:10.440 --> 11:03:12.440
But I'm not good on my own

11:03:12.920 --> 11:03:14.600
um

11:03:14.600 --> 11:03:18.440
Three gens worth of tubers. I will become a husk

11:03:19.240 --> 11:03:21.240
I'll become a husk honestly

11:03:22.360 --> 11:03:24.360
Maybe we can guess after the second gen

11:03:33.160 --> 11:03:39.640
Oh, no, you can't guess it because there's two secret words that aren't present

11:03:40.520 --> 11:03:43.720
It it forms a sentence basically

11:03:44.760 --> 11:03:49.400
All three gens perform a sentence that perfectly encapsulates won't be where it is

11:03:52.440 --> 11:03:54.440
Indulge marionette and you're like nah

11:03:55.320 --> 11:03:59.480
Yeah, you're no the secret words makes it impossible. Just wanted to drop one more

11:03:59.560 --> 11:04:02.760
Mario I've watched all the velo girls and well, I like them a lot your mouse. Oh

11:04:03.320 --> 11:04:06.040
Thank you. Are you sure? I'm your oh, she though like

11:04:07.000 --> 11:04:11.000
I'm not gonna say anything but like emmy's teas and oof aces accent

11:04:11.000 --> 11:04:19.880
And she sounds so fucking adorable in our accent. I wish I could copy it, but I can't why is she irish?

11:04:20.280 --> 11:04:22.280
I see. Why are you irish?

11:04:22.600 --> 11:04:24.440
I don't know

11:04:24.440 --> 11:04:26.440
I just love the way she sounds

11:04:26.760 --> 11:04:29.960
But I feel like I'm doing a terrible. That's terrible

11:04:31.720 --> 11:04:33.720
You have your own accent power

11:04:34.040 --> 11:04:36.040
power

11:04:36.520 --> 11:04:44.760
Sure, well the sentence will look good, but what gen four? No, I am not. I am absolutely not doing any further

11:04:45.640 --> 11:04:51.640
So there some people were like, are you doing a spin-off gen? Are you doing like a safer work variation? No

11:04:52.760 --> 11:04:59.720
I've absolutely no interest. I am exhausted. I took so much hp damage getting gen one out

11:05:00.440 --> 11:05:04.520
I am very thankful to say that if gen two and three do happen

11:05:04.920 --> 11:05:11.400
The hp damage is reduced significantly because I learned so much. I learned so much

11:05:11.960 --> 11:05:13.960
and

11:05:14.120 --> 11:05:18.840
When you do the first time you do it, it's so hard, but anytime after it just gets easier

11:05:19.880 --> 11:05:24.040
But I am I have no interest. I feel like absolutely no

11:05:25.000 --> 11:05:27.800
Shade or anything to any other Vtuber agency

11:05:28.360 --> 11:05:31.480
If you start throwing gen after gen it is very clear

11:05:31.640 --> 11:05:36.600
You do not give an absolute rat's arse about the content for your girls

11:05:37.080 --> 11:05:41.480
And it's just it's such a shame that those girls put faith in you as an agency

11:05:41.960 --> 11:05:46.680
And your response is throw another gen out throw another. No, absolutely. No

11:05:47.400 --> 11:05:51.080
No, very disappointing. I don't like that. That's just me

11:05:51.720 --> 11:05:57.080
Uh, you like instantly became my Oshie. I don't have an endurance for long streamers

11:05:57.080 --> 11:06:02.040
But I really enjoy stopping in on stream throughout the day. I'm glad I'm glad I can catch it

11:06:02.040 --> 11:06:05.800
I'll see you tomorrow in old school runescape. Huh? Huh? You might you might not be in the game

11:06:06.280 --> 11:06:08.520
But I'll I'll be online. I'll be online. Okay

11:06:10.360 --> 11:06:13.800
55 hp on a player you keep talking

11:06:15.080 --> 11:06:17.080
with her damage

11:06:17.400 --> 11:06:19.240
Yeah

11:06:19.240 --> 11:06:21.960
I keep taking damage with her with her damage

11:06:23.640 --> 11:06:29.160
Human wave tactic based running strongy. Are there any ASMR stories based on your life?

11:06:31.160 --> 11:06:38.200
Um, I have rambling ASMR coming out where I'm just kind of talking about stuff that's happening. No, that's me

11:06:41.400 --> 11:06:43.800
If you mean the small peepee audio then

11:06:43.960 --> 11:06:51.800
Uh, there's an anon that's very passionate about it and he sent me a prompt and

11:06:52.680 --> 11:06:56.200
Well, he didn't he didn't actually even mean to make it into a script or anything

11:06:56.200 --> 11:07:01.320
He just sent me a prompt of what he liked and I was like, you know what you know what I'll make it into something

11:07:01.960 --> 11:07:08.680
So your guys are more than welcome to use marshmallows to put down your things because it unironically can inspire me to make like an entire script

11:07:09.400 --> 11:07:14.280
Um, I am happy to take inspiration. I'll yank it. I like reading your deep dark fantasy

11:07:15.960 --> 11:07:20.920
I want to hit them with a disc tracker. I know but also I don't want to go into them and be like public enemy number one in veilerland

11:07:21.640 --> 11:07:23.640
I talk a lot of them

11:07:23.960 --> 11:07:25.960
But I'm such a little teddy bear

11:07:27.080 --> 11:07:29.080
No, it's all funny you

11:07:29.320 --> 11:07:31.080
I have to admit something

11:07:31.080 --> 11:07:35.080
I fall asleep to your voice during streams only for a little bit like 30 minutes to an hour

11:07:35.080 --> 11:07:38.520
The volume doesn't matter your voice just knocks me out. I get so cozy from the yapping

11:07:39.160 --> 11:07:41.160
Did I wake you up through the rage part?

11:07:41.880 --> 11:07:43.000
against

11:07:43.000 --> 11:07:47.800
Against the rda guy in section. I'm sorry if I woke you up with my screen

11:07:51.400 --> 11:07:55.400
Hey, stroney, I'm glad to catch some of your lives. I've been recovering from

11:07:56.760 --> 11:08:00.520
The unmentionable one and I'm finally feeling better. I hope to see

11:08:01.560 --> 11:08:04.360
many more streams from you and the girls

11:08:05.640 --> 11:08:07.640
I

11:08:10.520 --> 11:08:13.000
Someone signed this with their name, sorry

11:08:14.920 --> 11:08:16.920
I think this might be

11:08:16.920 --> 11:08:18.920
um

11:08:19.480 --> 11:08:24.200
I'm hope you're okay, and I'm glad you feel better. You're starting to feel more like yourself

11:08:25.080 --> 11:08:28.680
Sorry, you've signed it and I don't know if I should see your name out. So for respect

11:08:28.680 --> 11:08:31.400
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna think it but you guys are welcome to sign maros

11:08:31.400 --> 11:08:34.120
But I won't see your name if you sign a marrow at the bomb. Okay

11:08:35.880 --> 11:08:40.040
I'm glad you picked samwise the brave. I am so glad

11:08:41.320 --> 11:08:45.000
You my refling gave me the courage seriously

11:08:45.800 --> 11:08:47.800
Why the refling?

11:08:47.960 --> 11:08:49.400
I don't know

11:08:49.400 --> 11:08:51.400
Maybe it's because he gives me courage

11:08:53.880 --> 11:08:55.880
Hi, stroney saying this is the scott

11:08:55.880 --> 11:08:59.080
So when I say this, you know, it's not just because of the accent

11:08:59.400 --> 11:09:03.400
I love your voice. Listen to you up on stream is my favorite part of your stream and when you talk

11:09:03.960 --> 11:09:08.520
Gently it gives me tingles. I'm really looking forward to the ASMR. Wait, I can give you tingles

11:09:08.520 --> 11:09:10.520
Just when I be a bit more gentler in the magic

11:09:11.240 --> 11:09:13.240
That's interesting

11:09:13.400 --> 11:09:16.840
Normally, I like I only happen in the the ting the tingy

11:09:17.720 --> 11:09:19.720
Goodbye those who are sleeping

11:09:21.000 --> 11:09:24.360
I gotta go finish up work. Have a good day. Yeah. Have a good day. Thanks for hanging

11:09:25.640 --> 11:09:26.760
Uh

11:09:26.760 --> 11:09:28.760
Thank you

11:09:29.080 --> 11:09:31.080
Definitely not

11:09:31.240 --> 11:09:33.720
Hmm. What are you saying?

11:09:34.440 --> 11:09:38.280
Read at your own risk, but are you gonna do a hmm audio involving?

11:09:39.480 --> 11:09:41.480
Oh

11:09:42.520 --> 11:09:48.840
Let's call it joystick and we'll take the first three letters. Are you gonna do hypno joystick?

11:09:49.560 --> 11:09:53.880
Uh, yes, it's one of the main things I'm interested in

11:09:55.240 --> 11:09:57.240
I want to take full control

11:09:58.120 --> 11:10:00.120
Hmm

11:10:00.520 --> 11:10:05.800
The question is can I put you under though? I'm I'm a bit unskilled at the under part

11:10:05.880 --> 11:10:09.560
It's scary to put you under because I'm not sure how good I am at it

11:10:10.120 --> 11:10:16.520
And as well, I don't know if the accent is actually a debuff on putting you under a spell or the control type

11:10:16.840 --> 11:10:18.840
Section of it. So I'm a bit worried

11:10:19.480 --> 11:10:23.560
We'll see what happens. As I said, I'm learning and you guys have been fantastic and

11:10:24.200 --> 11:10:27.560
Will be like you guys are always fantastic and give me like a lot of space

11:10:28.040 --> 11:10:30.040
It'll take time to get

11:10:30.600 --> 11:10:35.240
To get there. What am I doing? I'm good at pretending. Oh, I believe in you. Hey

11:10:36.760 --> 11:10:38.760
I love that you're

11:10:41.240 --> 11:10:46.120
I'm trying I woke up and so you're still streaming now come home and you're still at it. You're on another level

11:10:46.600 --> 11:10:49.960
Yeah, we we finished up a cup maybe an hour ago

Um, I kind of leaked kind of who goes there identify yourself. Um about now. Oh my cold. My tea's getting cold

11:11:05.000 --> 11:11:07.000
I'm getting cold

11:11:10.040 --> 11:11:15.480
Someone says do not open on stream that makes me want to open it even more just for the hell of it

11:11:16.200 --> 11:11:18.200
He

11:11:19.720 --> 11:11:24.360
Will you ever do a stream with incur the viewers are encouraged to make it to the end? I don't

11:11:24.360 --> 11:11:25.640
Wow

11:11:25.640 --> 11:11:28.360
I would never do something like that five

11:11:29.320 --> 11:11:33.560
No, no, no, not right now. Not right now. No right now

11:11:36.360 --> 11:11:40.760
I couldn't be so dastard like it off. Oh, that's so bad

11:11:41.720 --> 11:11:48.040
For no, no, I'm joking. Actually. I'm joking. I'm joking relax relax. No

0.5 is genius

11:12:23.000 --> 11:12:25.000
I think I caught up on all the questions already

11:12:25.880 --> 11:12:31.400
Uh, hopefully I don't miss too many. Oh, well, we just got another 15. So it's okay. We're not going anywhere

11:12:36.120 --> 11:12:41.160
I've almost finished almost finished

11:12:51.960 --> 11:12:58.600
Someone made a meme based on stream today, monkaS. I'm fast when you make a meme or is it just me screaming be honest

11:13:00.040 --> 11:13:02.040
Hold on see if I can open it up

Okay, hold on. Let me see if I can put this on screen right now. Hold on. Let me kick. Let me kick

And then if I go on desktop and then I can put it on stream

11:13:28.280 --> 11:13:31.160
So this is the meme. This is the meme to victory

11:13:31.800 --> 11:13:34.360
Strongly fighting for the navi freedom

11:13:35.320 --> 11:13:38.280
Strongly fighting for the rda angry scottish noises

11:13:44.680 --> 11:13:49.880

That I can't fulfill this fantasy

11:14:36.040 --> 11:14:42.200
Unfortunately, it actually alienates people. Um, I am interested in the opposite though

Where I I help you to my daughters

11:14:50.520 --> 11:14:52.520

Like a no no and it's it's basically career death and I'm so sorry

11:15:03.320 --> 11:15:09.160
I really do apologize because I do like the idea of like everyone gets to hear their thing like my attempt at their thing

11:15:09.800 --> 11:15:16.680
But unfortunately, I would never do anything that would risk the girls and stuff and I do apologize

11:15:17.400 --> 11:15:19.400
Um

11:15:19.400 --> 11:15:25.640
Yeah, our cami for real you made this happen through your determinant through my freaking brain deadness

11:15:26.920 --> 11:15:31.720
Free but okay, I'll read it because you're actually being very kind to me and I'm just being harsh to myself

11:15:32.360 --> 11:15:38.360
Our cami for real you made this happen through your determination innovation love kindness or meaningless take this w

11:15:38.360 --> 11:15:43.320
You have deserved it and of course will still support the daughters. They are so wonderful. They are

11:15:44.440 --> 11:15:46.440
I need to burp

11:15:46.680 --> 11:15:48.440
Who goes there?

11:15:48.440 --> 11:15:54.600
I don't know who keeps coming into my room and burping but I keep asking them who goes there and no one responds. It's really weird

11:15:56.040 --> 11:15:57.880
Like I asked them to identify themselves

11:15:57.880 --> 11:16:00.440
I asked them I say by the pope you have to respond to me

11:16:00.520 --> 11:16:03.800
But just someone keeps coming in burping and then leaving it's bizarre

11:16:04.680 --> 11:16:06.680
It's totally not me

11:16:07.320 --> 11:16:13.480
No question just an old reddish happy to be back and swimming in the reef. Oh, do you like the reef?

11:16:14.120 --> 11:16:17.400
Should I get you little armbands? Oh, no, you're well, you're a squid

11:16:19.960 --> 11:16:21.720
We're both aquatic

11:16:21.720 --> 11:16:27.160
Just wanted to say that I'm proud to call you my cami. Oh, I'll stop you can't call me comey. Oh, she yes

11:16:27.160 --> 11:16:34.440
You dork you are my cami. Oh, she and I'm wishing you and the girls success and men may your achievement be many

11:16:35.160 --> 11:16:40.040

11:16:41.000 --> 11:16:43.800

Odd can I do it now? I don't know if my voice is too fried to do it now. Hold on. I'll meet now

11:16:52.200 --> 11:16:54.200
I'll see if we can do it

11:16:54.200 --> 11:16:59.400
Right the sentence is rise warrior jar wake up and make it everyone's problem. You can do it

11:16:59.880 --> 11:17:03.480
Oh, I think my voice is too fried, but we'll try it anyway. We'll try it anywhere

11:17:04.840 --> 11:17:06.840
Rise warrior jar

11:17:07.320 --> 11:17:13.080
Make make up. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. Hold on. Hold on. I got stage fright. I got stage fright. I'm sorry

11:17:14.760 --> 11:17:20.360
Rise warrior jar wake up and make it everyone's problem. You can do it

11:17:21.400 --> 11:17:23.400
Yeah

11:17:23.720 --> 11:17:25.720
Sorry, I messed it up

11:17:27.080 --> 11:17:29.080
I apologize

11:17:30.680 --> 11:17:36.520
How does it feel to know that you have me addicted to women of scottish accents? It's over for you

11:17:37.720 --> 11:17:39.720
It's over for you

11:17:40.120 --> 11:17:45.080
You crave the rolling ours. You crave the in lock

11:17:46.120 --> 11:17:47.960
and most of all

11:17:47.960 --> 11:17:51.400
You crave the smell of iron brew

11:17:52.360 --> 11:17:54.520
On the breath of the woman you've just kissed

11:17:57.640 --> 11:17:59.640
You're you've been scott piled

11:18:00.840 --> 11:18:02.840
And there's no turning back

11:18:03.800 --> 11:18:06.200
The peak calls me. Oh shit. She's still going

11:18:07.640 --> 11:18:09.640
We've got another t-minus

11:18:11.560 --> 11:18:15.400
40 minutes. Uh, is mercy gonna be online in 40 minutes?

11:18:17.400 --> 11:18:19.400
I never thought about that

11:18:21.800 --> 11:18:23.800
I already had a taste for the scottish accent

11:18:25.880 --> 11:18:28.200
It's uh vetish. I'm sure no one

11:18:29.000 --> 11:18:33.160
But found out when I have mine scott piled. Oh, yeah. Yeah, she's still online. Okay

11:18:33.800 --> 11:18:38.440
Before I go offline, please remind me to make sure that mercy's like still actually going to be online

11:18:39.560 --> 11:18:42.440
If not, I'm probably going to redirect you into one of her songs

11:18:44.840 --> 11:18:47.480
I'll make you listen to aces furry

11:18:48.680 --> 11:18:50.680
cover thing

11:18:50.920 --> 11:18:54.200
Extinous of passes on you. Oh, you're so warm. Oh

11:18:54.840 --> 11:18:56.120
I

11:18:56.120 --> 11:18:59.160
Love emmy's emmy aces frx wait

11:18:59.960 --> 11:19:02.520
Wait, the reason why I get ac and emmy mixed up all the time

11:19:02.600 --> 11:19:07.000
Is it because they both begin with I is because I used to call them the twins in development

11:19:07.320 --> 11:19:10.520
They were called the twins in development. I know they're not twins

11:19:10.920 --> 11:19:16.760
They I just called them twins. It just happened. Okay. So emmy and ac always get referred to each other by accident

11:19:17.560 --> 11:19:19.560
Now this few propositions were a question

11:19:21.000 --> 11:19:23.000
If you had a chance to change your oh

11:19:24.520 --> 11:19:25.800
I changed

11:19:25.800 --> 11:19:31.560
Forget changing fate. I put it into my own hands and I am strontic cuttles

11:19:33.240 --> 11:19:35.240
The cuttlefish of

11:19:36.600 --> 11:19:38.600
The war

11:19:40.840 --> 11:19:43.800
Sending them out to say that you and emmers are my favorites

11:19:43.960 --> 11:19:47.960
It means incredibly talented and really entertaining and she's an absolute sucky mom

11:19:48.040 --> 11:19:51.800
But there's something about you that makes you so easy to listen to

11:19:52.360 --> 11:19:56.120
It's probably because you can tell how low IQ I am. So I make you feel safe

11:19:58.040 --> 11:20:00.040
See mersey's a dork

11:20:00.040 --> 11:20:06.760
So you lure your guard around her but me because I'm brain dead. Yeah, you can't help that. You can't help that

11:20:09.560 --> 11:20:11.880
Thank you for the kind words kind kind of remark

11:20:13.720 --> 11:20:17.240
Warning for stream. Let's see how far I can read into this before we can

11:20:18.200 --> 11:20:22.120
As you stare into your reeflings eyes to hypnotize them

11:20:22.680 --> 11:20:26.440
You get a little too close to one and catch your reflection in the eyes

11:20:27.240 --> 11:20:30.280
You suddenly feel tired and a desire to bend to their

11:20:31.080 --> 11:20:33.080
Oh

11:20:33.640 --> 11:20:38.920
Good girl cuttles you want to give everything to your little reeflings stop. Oh my god

11:20:41.240 --> 11:20:43.240
No, I can't read that

11:20:44.200 --> 11:20:46.200
Mmm

11:20:46.920 --> 11:20:48.920
I need to finish reading it though

11:20:53.400 --> 11:20:59.400
No, I can't read that. No, I can't read that. That's going to change my brain thinking right now. I can't read that. Oh my god

11:21:01.880 --> 11:21:05.080
Excuse me, mom. I am sure you're my oh, yes. Thank you

11:21:06.760 --> 11:21:12.040
Ever said that Mario has made the seal up, bro. I'm not being funny. I felt it flower

11:21:14.200 --> 11:21:20.600
My favorite pokemon. Oh, you can't make me pick. Oh, there's so many

11:21:22.200 --> 11:21:25.240
I like creepy pokemon. I like when they look cute and creepy

11:21:26.360 --> 11:21:33.800
Uh, who wrote that? And you know, no, no subspace stop it. We're not going into subspace another another time

11:21:33.800 --> 11:21:35.800
But not not no subspace

11:21:36.600 --> 11:21:38.600
No subspace. All right

11:21:38.920 --> 11:21:40.920
I bite it

11:21:41.640 --> 11:21:49.640
Because if no the problem is if I go into subspace, I can't talk. I literally can't talk. How am I supposed to entertain if I can't talk

11:21:51.000 --> 11:21:53.000
If I'm just here squealing like a little

11:21:56.440 --> 11:22:01.880
Subspace emissary reference subspace emissary reference. No

11:22:02.760 --> 11:22:05.160
subspace is a thinking a type

11:22:06.760 --> 11:22:09.480
And it makes it really hard for me to freaking talk

11:22:09.960 --> 11:22:11.960
Through it. It's really freaking hard

11:22:13.400 --> 11:22:15.160
And I can't talk

11:22:15.160 --> 11:22:17.160
And I need to be able to talk

11:22:18.200 --> 11:22:20.200
You can't just stare at my face while I go

11:22:22.200 --> 11:22:28.440
I'm so happy that I saw you on my Twitter feed. Oh, is that how you found me on Twitter? Oh, maybe I should actually start using Twitter then

11:22:29.880 --> 11:22:31.880
Oh, I don't like using Twitter

11:22:32.360 --> 11:22:37.160
All the girls have been so fantastic like I'm streaming in one hour. I'm doing this. I'm doing that

11:22:37.560 --> 11:22:40.120
I literally have put nothing on Twitter. I can't

11:22:40.920 --> 11:22:41.800
like

11:22:41.800 --> 11:22:43.160
I

11:22:43.160 --> 11:22:45.160
I've used Twitter to make ASMR

11:22:45.960 --> 11:22:52.280
Collapse that's it. I can't do it. Okay. Please. Please. I can't do it. Twitter please. It's so

11:22:56.760 --> 11:23:02.680
Can't could stare at your face for an age less you underestimate what you do at karaoke stream with the girls

11:23:03.320 --> 11:23:07.480
I think latency is too much for me with the girls

11:23:07.560 --> 11:23:12.120
However, the girls might be able to do it with one another because latency wouldn't be an issue

11:23:13.560 --> 11:23:18.440
Um, I have to put your stream schedule on my desk to make sure I remember. I'm so bad

11:23:18.520 --> 11:23:21.720
I apologize if people use twitter for notifications. I I just

11:23:22.280 --> 11:23:23.720
I don't like it

11:23:23.720 --> 11:23:28.040
I don't like it. I actually don't like it. I'm sorry. Well, I'm off to work. Good night. And don't for

11:23:28.600 --> 11:23:32.360
Forget to wash you to brush my teeth. Yes. I won't forget

11:23:32.920 --> 11:23:37.560
Uh, if it's been 30 minutes since I last drank. Yes, it will be. Okay. We'll brush your teeth right before you end

11:23:37.880 --> 11:23:41.160
Twitter recently uh, officially allowed the content

11:23:42.760 --> 11:23:44.760
And it's signal boosting the words mentioning

11:23:45.560 --> 11:23:51.320
Is it I'ma make a a certain video then I've been needing to make a video as a thank you for ages

11:23:51.880 --> 11:23:54.760
I'm stalling. I'm scared because maybe I should do it now

11:23:55.640 --> 11:23:57.640
Maybe

11:23:58.280 --> 11:23:59.960
Yeah

11:23:59.960 --> 11:24:02.360
Shimmy shimmy. Yeah, shimmy. Yeah, shimmy. Yeah

11:24:04.600 --> 11:24:06.600
I wonder what I could be playing

11:24:07.800 --> 11:24:11.400
And I really strongly mean may have a good sleep schedule because I wake up early to watch

11:24:12.200 --> 11:24:13.400
Oh

11:24:13.400 --> 11:24:18.840
I'm glad. Ah, yes, the bits get upside down when they go to Australia. So it takes places long for computer

11:24:21.080 --> 11:24:23.960
Uh, it's a bit squid me right now by the pope

11:24:24.760 --> 11:24:27.400
Wow, you really are still online

11:24:27.960 --> 11:24:29.960
Good morning. Good morning

11:24:30.840 --> 11:24:32.840
Thank you, paginga. Yes

11:24:33.000 --> 11:24:38.280
Um, we finished the game around the nine hour mark and then ended up rambling so much

11:24:38.280 --> 11:24:40.280
We got to the 10 hour mark

11:24:40.360 --> 11:24:45.880
And then I made a cup of tea and it just made sense that we're just gonna ramble until the 12 hour mark

11:24:46.280 --> 11:24:47.800
Just because we can

11:24:47.800 --> 11:24:51.880
Yeah, yeah, no, no, we're just having a good time. We just done our thing. But good morning

11:24:52.760 --> 11:24:57.160
And I hope you're all ready for it happening again tomorrow because I'll be online all day

11:24:58.760 --> 11:25:01.880
Hey, let me hear about these things. Why am I going so much?

11:25:06.760 --> 11:25:09.400
I think I got everything

11:25:11.400 --> 11:25:15.560
But yeah, I couldn't I couldn't pick a pokemon. I like creepy we pokemon. Oh, no

11:25:16.360 --> 11:25:18.360
All right, I've refreshed again

11:25:18.840 --> 11:25:21.160
And there's quite a few more questions. So hopefully I can get to

11:25:22.200 --> 11:25:24.200
Stream warning. This is meant to me

11:25:26.840 --> 11:25:29.160
Am I supposed to read it then or not?

11:25:33.800 --> 11:25:36.280
Yeah, well, I didn't work it right it didn't work

11:25:38.520 --> 11:25:40.520
He said kneel and submit

11:25:40.760 --> 11:25:42.600

11:25:42.600 --> 11:25:44.600
You're not getting me today

11:25:44.760 --> 11:25:48.680
I've done see when I do a little bit of the a little bit of the

11:25:49.240 --> 11:25:51.240
Gnosis when I do the noses

11:25:52.840 --> 11:25:54.840
I get very

11:25:54.920 --> 11:25:56.280
You know

11:25:56.280 --> 11:25:57.640
So good luck

11:25:57.640 --> 11:25:59.640
another another day, baby

11:26:01.560 --> 11:26:04.040
Good girls are entertaining what even stop right?

11:26:07.240 --> 11:26:09.240
Scrolling past that stop it

11:26:10.920 --> 11:26:14.440
You and the rest of the viewer are the first I ran into to lean

11:26:15.400 --> 11:26:16.920
Into the other side of content

11:26:16.920 --> 11:26:19.640
I wasn't sure how to take it at first because it's not my cup of tea

11:26:19.800 --> 11:26:24.680
But you love being genuinely entertaining regardless wishing on but but thank you so much. Yes

11:26:25.240 --> 11:26:27.240
There is a lot of information on the website

11:26:27.800 --> 11:26:31.960
And like a lot of people didn't realize what the heck we were doing and it was like bro

11:26:32.040 --> 11:26:35.240
We're self-beach over so we'll be playing games like of course

11:26:35.240 --> 11:26:40.040
I'm still going to talk about satan creep brotherhood tune and stream snake and all that, you know

11:26:41.000 --> 11:26:44.840
It just means we offer the goods on the other side and we're not a blue ball in you

11:26:44.840 --> 11:26:49.480
I think because there's quite a lot of v-tubers that like to do the blue ball part and it's like well

11:26:50.600 --> 11:26:52.600
If you if you want the goods then yeah

11:26:53.240 --> 11:26:59.160
They're for free you can go on all twitters or if you if you want to support uh, then with your with your manis

11:26:59.480 --> 11:27:01.480
Then you can just do it

11:27:02.760 --> 11:27:06.680
Patreon or membership if youtube updates it stats tomorrow

11:27:07.400 --> 11:27:12.040
Hmm you almost went into stuff. I'm not I'm not

11:27:14.680 --> 11:27:18.360
But yeah, but you occasionally different at the thingy like in preview

11:27:20.760 --> 11:27:22.760
That was to paint you all up though

11:27:23.800 --> 11:27:29.320
I think everyone did a good job. We all we all collectively were like, you know that meme that's like

11:27:30.040 --> 11:27:32.040
Let me hold on maybe I can find it

11:27:32.280 --> 11:27:34.280
I

11:27:37.080 --> 11:27:40.600
Put it on string. Oh, yeah, this was literally it

11:27:44.360 --> 11:27:46.360
Basically this meme if I can see the image

11:27:48.360 --> 11:27:50.360
This one

11:27:53.400 --> 11:27:57.720
This was the meme so it was like chaos behind the scene setting up for debut

11:27:58.200 --> 11:28:02.200
But like we all came together to discuss how we're like absolutely going to destroy

11:28:02.280 --> 11:28:05.960
Everyone unanimously and like do all these like things to like get everyone pent up

11:28:06.440 --> 11:28:09.240
I'm not even pretending. Otherwise like literally chaos

11:28:10.040 --> 11:28:15.320
Is the top one all of us preparing for debut. But when it came to discussing like, okay, let's release the alt twitters

11:28:39.880 --> 11:28:41.880
You know a rainbow

11:28:44.280 --> 11:28:46.280

11:29:03.240 --> 11:29:05.240
You're evil

I know you gave us the most wholesome girl in existence

11:29:09.640 --> 11:29:12.040
I've got a lot of those comments where people are like

11:29:12.760 --> 11:29:16.440
The whole agency was based around like this alternative thing

11:29:17.000 --> 11:29:21.800
And then like everyone's just like memeing along and having a good time and all that and it's like yeah surprise

11:29:22.440 --> 11:29:25.000
Like we're we're here for enjoy ourselves

11:29:25.800 --> 11:29:29.240
I think it can get quite tiresome of every breath in second. It's

11:29:30.360 --> 11:29:32.360

11:29:50.360 --> 11:29:54.840
You girls are amazing at getting people in credit with first day

11:29:56.200 --> 11:30:02.280
My girl's so first day. She a Lamborghini. That's not that song. Oh, what's that song my girl's so thirsty

11:30:03.800 --> 11:30:09.560
Yellow lumber purple Lamborghini. I have absolutely not clue what that song supposed to be. Thank you for the tip, alessandro

11:30:10.920 --> 11:30:14.440
Yeah, it could be everything but it makes a nice thing a bit of a male

11:30:15.160 --> 11:30:18.680
Just curious. But are there any creators you would like to collaborate with outside the group?

11:30:19.480 --> 11:30:22.920
sadly, I um, uh very

11:30:24.200 --> 11:30:26.200
I don't know what the word is

11:30:28.200 --> 11:30:34.840
If people reach out to me, I am more than happy to but I feel like if I reach out then

11:30:35.640 --> 11:30:37.080
I'm

11:30:37.080 --> 11:30:43.160
Bothering so like the yumi plus girls will be nothing but receptive to me. I absolutely adore them. So I'm I'm gonna try and

11:30:44.120 --> 11:30:47.640
Get a collab going with them or something or ASMR or anything like that

11:30:48.280 --> 11:30:55.000
Um, but like anyone basically the sentence if you f with me. I f with you, but because like

11:30:55.960 --> 11:30:57.960
Oh strong ease from

11:30:57.960 --> 11:30:58.840
um

11:30:58.840 --> 11:31:03.240
Vila or like I don't want anyone feeling forced and I'm also quite

11:31:05.560 --> 11:31:10.840
I'm appropriate with certain jokes and I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable during a collab. So I only

11:31:11.000 --> 11:31:14.200
I don't know. I'm just shy like I really like Finn

11:31:14.920 --> 11:31:21.080
But I would never ask for a collab because I just I I know for a fact like I would just make her uncomfortable

11:31:21.400 --> 11:31:26.120
So I'm just gonna be like thumbs up from afar. Love your stuff. You know can't wait for the next song cover

11:31:35.320 --> 11:31:38.760
Stop singing I'm trying to get secret tunnel on my head. Oh my god. That was like so fun

11:31:40.840 --> 11:31:42.840
I've been a pie

11:31:46.840 --> 11:31:54.840
Sadly most potential clubs speak English instead of scottish. Oh, they'll never understand me. Well, there was actually something really funny. Um

11:31:55.800 --> 11:32:00.360
What's that azura in debut called me a fish and when we were doing the mock

11:32:00.440 --> 11:32:02.760
I was with the girls like um

11:32:03.320 --> 11:32:07.960
We were doing the mock so five of us were in the voice call and whoever was doing the mock went and did it

11:32:08.520 --> 11:32:10.520
Um and azura called me a fish

11:32:10.920 --> 11:32:16.280
And I was like a fish in my accent and the girls were like laughing up a storm over it

11:32:16.360 --> 11:32:19.480
And I was like, oh, yeah, I freaking love it here

11:32:19.560 --> 11:32:22.520
Like they're just so amazing and they they just get it

11:32:23.160 --> 11:32:28.280
But like I feel like if I collabed with someone outside of viola like they're afraid to make fun of my accent

11:32:28.280 --> 11:32:31.400
I'm like, no make fun of it. Are you joking me? I say words funny

11:32:31.720 --> 11:32:36.600
Someone was saying like the way I say joe wheel there earlier in that like come on

11:32:37.320 --> 11:32:39.480
Why is my freaking mouth wiggling?

11:32:40.600 --> 11:32:42.600

11:32:42.600 --> 11:32:44.600

11:32:44.600 --> 11:32:48.200
I see you doing that iphone. Don't make him a mouth wiggle

11:32:58.600 --> 11:33:02.360
