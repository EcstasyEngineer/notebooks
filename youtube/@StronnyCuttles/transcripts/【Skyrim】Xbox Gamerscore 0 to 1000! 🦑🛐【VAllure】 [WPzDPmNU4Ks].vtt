00:00.000 --> 00:09.800
Testing, testing. Attention, please. Attention, attention. Hear you, hear you.

00:09.800 --> 00:17.000
Skyrim belongs to the North. That's my hear you, hear you. Why are you saying I

00:17.000 --> 00:22.840
hate you? I'm not even fricking spawning yet! Let me spawn in! You know, I learned

00:22.840 --> 00:28.000
something new yesterday thanks to TikTok so I can't wait to talk about it.

00:28.000 --> 00:41.920
Right, testing. This is Ambroker. See this fricking, you fricking freaks? Oh my God! Oh my

00:41.920 --> 00:49.200
God! I'm YouTube, I got accepted from YouTube monetization like right now. No

00:49.200 --> 00:55.520
way! I just got accepted for YouTube monetization right fricking now. No way!

00:55.520 --> 01:02.560
Wait, but I need to do my stream then. Wait! Oh my God! I literally just opened up

01:02.560 --> 01:12.360
YouTube studio. I've been accepted. No way! Wait, do I need to go offline and do my...

01:12.360 --> 01:19.920
No, I'll do it tomorrow. Oh my God! We did it! What the frick? What the frick frack

01:19.920 --> 01:26.920
tiddly-tack-tick-tack-patty-work? Oh my God! Wait, and hopefully this doesn't say anything.

01:26.920 --> 01:33.120
Wow! Wow! I just fricking checked. Right, right. We're still going to do Skyrim

01:33.120 --> 01:37.680
today because you know, Skyrim belongs to the Norths. But tomorrow I'll get to do my

01:37.680 --> 01:43.360
monetization celebration stream! And my toe is like amazing for it so I'm excited.

01:43.360 --> 01:49.680
Oh my God! That's amazing. Right, if you're fricking watching right now, don't

01:49.680 --> 01:54.720
worry about how you call it. The memberships aren't activated because I

01:54.720 --> 02:00.720
need to go in and tell it what to call the tiers and stuff. But I'm 100%

02:00.720 --> 02:07.240
sure tier one is $1.99 USD. This is to prevent anyone gaining access via

02:07.240 --> 02:13.320
gift to membership streams. And then I believe the membership price, like the

02:13.360 --> 02:27.360
actual price, is $4.99 USD. Does that sound right? I need to ask you guys. I need to ask you guys what sounds right.

02:27.360 --> 02:35.280
You guys call the shots. Yeah, if it's $4.99 USD and then Patreon's $5 USD then it's $9.99 total to

02:35.280 --> 02:40.240
support your Oshii at Veiler. You're okay. That seems right. Okay, that sounds

02:40.280 --> 02:43.480
okay. Everyone's going to give me the thumbs up.

02:43.480 --> 02:49.480
Congrats on the monetization. Doesn't mean we won't support you in other ways anymore though.

02:49.480 --> 02:52.480
Oh, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

02:52.480 --> 02:59.480
Why are you giving me money for getting more money?

02:59.480 --> 03:08.840
What the fuck? It's an infinite money glitch. Oh my God. Also, there was an offline donation

03:08.880 --> 03:13.840
by Shank. Shank says, thank you for the tip, by the way. He says, I'm over here squidding

03:13.840 --> 03:20.920
my dick. I got ink on my dick right now. Which is so good. Thank you, Tim Shuttle. Congrats

03:20.920 --> 03:27.120
on the monetization. Thank you. And Bajinga as well. Thank you again for the tip, for

03:27.120 --> 03:34.720
the 20. That was a big tip. Thank you. Okay, to prevent gifts, you need to set the membership

03:34.720 --> 03:40.640
quote above five bucks. Are you serious? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wasn't it not membership

03:40.640 --> 03:48.480
can only be gifted? Stop giving me! Why are you giving me money for being able to make

03:48.480 --> 03:57.480
Oh my God. No, I have to end my ASMR series now. I have four ASMR videos. I owe you. Oh,

03:57.480 --> 04:02.480
and I'm doing an endurance stream today. It's over. Reluctantly saying thank you for the

04:02.520 --> 04:11.020
tip. Wait, I could have sworn you can only gift the lowest tier membership on YouTube

04:11.020 --> 04:16.320
or has that been updated since? I won't say who so they can announce it themselves, but

04:16.320 --> 04:22.600
someone else has also gotten monetized. Oh my God, we're all done are monetized. No way.

04:22.600 --> 04:27.960
Like, okay, so the only reason we didn't like monetize faster in quotation marks is because

04:27.960 --> 04:36.520
you stop it. Don't give me money for getting money. Preordering my search. Thank you. Don't

04:36.520 --> 04:43.320
stay down for the tip. That's crazy. That's freaking crazy. Gifts go to the most expensive

04:43.320 --> 04:49.480
tier under five bucks. So I need to set it as 501. That looks terrible though. That looks

04:49.480 --> 04:56.160
so greedy, but I can't have any outsiders in the membership streams because I need to

04:56.160 --> 05:03.240
use a lot of euphemisms. Are you squid me right now? Shank. Oh, it's offline. I'm all

05:03.240 --> 05:09.920
about stron of the bath. Thanks, Shank, for the tip. You guys will get the Blackwater

05:09.920 --> 05:18.920
reference very shortly. Super training up. Virginia. Stop. Actually, one cent greed law.

05:18.920 --> 05:25.240
Actually, it's two cent greed because I wanted it $4.99 as fat. Said it to sit. No, $6 is

05:25.320 --> 05:33.320
too much. This is too much money to ask for, like, for membership stuff. Oh, right, that's

05:33.320 --> 05:39.120
it. When I said we're making an agency together, we flinched. I wasn't kidding. Oh, I see.

05:39.120 --> 05:44.040
And our snowberries are here. They just did an ASMR stream. We all have to keep our voices

05:44.040 --> 05:51.200
down, okay? The snowberries are asleep. Fine, you've got it. Set it to 999. I would start

05:51.280 --> 06:02.280
at $60 just to be sure. Post up. Hi, icy raiders. Hi, snowberries. I just unlocked monetization.

06:02.280 --> 06:07.920
I didn't know until I freaking went on my channel. It just happened right now. I'm not

06:07.920 --> 06:13.000
going to do my monetization celebration today. I'm going to do it tomorrow and then it gives

06:13.000 --> 06:17.680
me less time to do endurance skyrim unless we come back to maybe switch up the thingy.

06:17.760 --> 06:24.480
But that's okay. It's actually a perfect transition from icy stream. Hi, hi, little icicle.

06:26.480 --> 06:34.640
But yes, we are all getting monetized very slowly, which is fantastic. Oh my gosh, you can get

06:34.640 --> 06:40.800
support via email or chat. Don't worry, that chat support thing does absolutely nothing.

06:41.760 --> 06:48.800
I assure you, it doesn't do a single thing, okay? I actually, I tell a lie, they did help me one

06:48.800 --> 06:53.920
time, so I'll give it up. Amy, thank you, Amy, for your clap, clap, clap. Apparently, there's

06:53.920 --> 06:58.800
one other person that has been processed. When we applied, it was like, yeah, it takes a month

06:58.800 --> 07:05.360
for them to review your chat. A month! A month to review James Cameron's avatar, excuse me.

07:05.360 --> 07:13.440
A month to freaking review Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, excuse me. Oh no, no, oh you guys

07:13.440 --> 07:22.800
so much ASMR video. But I do have some good news about VTuber Collabs. I finally, I finally

07:25.120 --> 07:32.960
sent away. So now I'm waiting on the girls. The ball is now in the girls court that I'm collabing

07:32.960 --> 07:44.720
with. Yeah, yesterday, I was listening to a music creator called Yoast. He's a Dutch and he was in

07:44.720 --> 07:54.560
Eurovision and he said, welcome to Europe. Life is till the end, Europe, Europe, Europe. Turns out he has

07:54.560 --> 08:03.680
a song where it goes, suck my, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. So just imagine me playing the song and

08:03.680 --> 08:14.080
repeat in the dark, taping up four ASMR collabs in one go. A month review time sounds realistic,

08:14.080 --> 08:20.960
given the fact that your streams are all above 10 hours. Like I also thank you for the tip again,

08:21.040 --> 08:24.720
but you're giving a lot of money. You need to be careful. Are you screaming me right now?

08:30.320 --> 08:37.200
Thank you for the tip. Oh my God. Damn, I almost got that song out of my head. Yeah, so basically

08:37.200 --> 08:46.000
just imagine me in a dark room. Just, I had this song on repeat. I'm like, yeah, okay. Right,

08:46.000 --> 08:52.080
Wolf Mums, Pamper You to Sleep, right? Okay, what's next? Okay, Jealous VTubers drag you in an

08:52.080 --> 08:58.240
alleyway for tangos. Okay, but what's next? What's next? Right, next script now. Like I was on it.

08:58.240 --> 09:05.440
I was on it. Anonymous. It's the silent and on his back. He's giving money, but he's not saying

09:05.440 --> 09:10.960
anything. He's not getting Brian to say anything. Thank you for the tip. But yeah, anyway, that's

09:11.040 --> 09:16.160
how I work. I don't know how you work, but I work like a madman. Had to take a shower. So I've got

09:16.160 --> 09:22.320
to listen at 1.5 speed for the next 15 minutes. I was not prepared for the super speed beat up.

09:24.240 --> 09:30.400
So I was as strong as I forgot to live tweet or tweet. If you mean tweet, I have absolutely

09:30.400 --> 09:37.120
horrific news. I am the worst VTuber to ever spawn. I never use my emotes. I spent like so much on

09:37.120 --> 09:42.240
all these emotes. I never use them. I never tweet out when I'm live, because I start at the same

09:42.240 --> 09:48.960
time every single day and I'm like, you want to be here, you're gonna be here. Somebody,

09:50.160 --> 09:54.640
absolutely. Next script. YouTube to monetize you one day after you get approved. I mean,

09:54.640 --> 09:59.840
depending on how the monetization celebration goes tomorrow, that's quite plausible. But hey,

09:59.840 --> 10:06.320
at least a little bit YouTube history. Don't mind if I make the headlines for Veal Ur. So

10:06.320 --> 10:11.040
you guys go and support my gen mates. That's right. There are five other lovely girls in the

10:11.040 --> 10:17.920
description below for you to check out. If you cannot stand, Todd winning yet again with the

10:17.920 --> 10:24.160
Death Grip, the Skyrim has over female VTubers. Okay. So if you've had enough of that,

10:24.160 --> 10:30.080
Denny, you worry. I've got you sorted out. Sheepsters is going live in two minus two hours.

10:30.080 --> 10:35.600
I believe Emma and Azura, my goodness Azura, and is coming for my Endurance Stream title.

10:37.600 --> 10:45.360
For Goodness Gravy, she was up on a farm. No, it's not called Farmville. The farming star,

10:45.360 --> 10:49.760
Jew Valley, for goodness sake. And then she beady popped out of 10 of her Endurance Stream. I'm

10:49.760 --> 10:55.200
like, damn, they're coming from my title. I'm gonna show them how it's done. Okay, I'm gonna show

10:55.200 --> 11:00.400
them how it's done. I woke up feeling sick and I was like, oh, maybe I would do an Endurance Stream.

11:00.400 --> 11:05.840
But the moment I hit go live, it feels like I have been given a second burst of energy,

11:05.840 --> 11:10.800
a second wind, if you will. It's like that cinematic moment in like the video game

11:11.760 --> 11:15.280
thing. We're like, oh, Brian.

11:15.280 --> 11:21.440
Congrats on monetization. Does the meet and greet VIP pass come with the highest membership tier

11:21.440 --> 11:30.720
pre-order? Zarian. Dapper. Why would you give 100? That's so much. You never even said anything,

11:30.720 --> 11:39.920
Dapper bucket. Oh my God. Thank you for the 100. Iron Reaper 100. Why are you? Why are you giving me

11:39.920 --> 11:47.120
money for being able to earn more money? What's going on? What's going on? Have I missed something

11:47.120 --> 11:54.000
in the VTuber etiquette book? Iron Reaper, thank you for the 100. Dapper, thank you for the 100.

11:54.000 --> 12:00.640
Zarian, congrats on monetization. Meet and greet for anyone who goes over $20 on the donut.

12:01.680 --> 12:07.200
That's terrible. You can't say that part out loud. Literally, everyone is giving your,

12:07.200 --> 12:13.680
yeah, please make sure you are fully sorted before you give any money. Please understand,

12:13.760 --> 12:22.240
I adore what I do. I have been welcomed with open arms into the VTuber community as someone who

12:22.240 --> 12:27.760
could definitely have been described as an outsider. And instead of being shunned,

12:27.760 --> 12:34.000
I was welcomed and taught the ropes, which I'm so thankful for. But please understand,

12:34.000 --> 12:42.160
like, I can stream for free. I love what I do, okay? Anonymous with a 20 with no message again.

12:42.160 --> 12:48.640
Brian, you look, you need to put Brian to work, guys, okay? You need to put Brian to work. Oh,

12:48.640 --> 12:57.760
Anonymous gave me 20 because I said the 20 thing. That is terrible. But we've done it. We

12:57.760 --> 13:06.000
officially have finished our first week at Bueller headquarters. Literally, everyone has done

13:06.000 --> 13:10.800
fantastic streaming. I am very happy to see some of the girls taking a break.

13:11.520 --> 13:15.840
Orvon Biscay. Brian. We don't like giving YouTube a cut.

13:18.080 --> 13:22.880
Wait, oh, that's why you just stream elements. Okay, I understand. I read about that. Thank you,

13:22.880 --> 13:29.200
Orvon Biscay. Brian! Don't knows will continue until morale improves. Congratulations. Wait,

13:29.200 --> 13:36.240
why did I know that? Quote. Do you guys hear Brian at all when he talks? Yeah, you do. Surely you do.

13:36.480 --> 13:44.800
Oh my god. Wait, you said I said your name yesterday correctly. Rilke? Rilke? Cadmus?

13:44.800 --> 13:48.880
Thank you for the tip. Why did I know that quote? Yeah, we hear him. Okay, thank god.

13:51.280 --> 13:55.920
God, it feels like so much longer. You've always been here. I think because, like,

13:55.920 --> 14:02.640
my average streamed week is probably what a VTuber achieves in an entire month. So it feels like

14:02.640 --> 14:07.680
I've been here for a very long time. I was like, nope, this is officially my first, like,

14:08.400 --> 14:14.320
strong, you know, first second week of streaming. Ancient joke. The beatings will continue until

14:14.320 --> 14:25.120
the more. Okay, that's okay. Okay, okay, okay. Guys, do you know a perfect way to party the

14:25.120 --> 14:30.880
achievement? A really big storm of bad joke. What did you even say? Was that supposed to be a joke?

14:31.520 --> 14:36.560
I don't get it. I don't get the joke if that was supposed to be a joke. So you're getting crickets.

14:41.200 --> 14:45.600
Who's ready? Who's ready for bi-zura, bi-zura, bi-zura. Now, I know that's not in this game,

14:45.600 --> 14:49.200
but bi-zura. Remember that time I accident... Wait, can you hear the game?

14:52.480 --> 14:55.600
Can you hear any of that? You can't hear any of that.

14:56.160 --> 15:02.160
Oh, oh, oh, wait, get monetization off the screen right now.

15:03.760 --> 15:06.560
Oh, my freaking mouse won't hover over... Right, there we go.

15:15.120 --> 15:17.280
Oh, my voice is cracking already. I've never even started.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.240
Oh, oh, oh.

15:23.120 --> 15:29.360
Don't begin. Don't begin. Don't begin of Skyrim. Don't know the words. One of them was like,

15:29.360 --> 15:32.720
all glass for a meme fucking cover.

15:36.400 --> 15:42.400
Bite pulp, Bryan. This is our attempt at normalizing corporate green-free donations fanning.

opposition to what the Legion is trying to put on the upon Skyrim as a whole

21:02.900 --> 21:08.340
okay so Skyrim is the current region that we're in there's different regions

21:08.340 --> 21:13.380

aggressive breed of bear if you didn't know that grizzly bears actually avoid

21:27.820 --> 21:33.900
human intervention apparently right so we are Nordic a citizens of Skyrim they

21:33.900 --> 21:38.260

21:38.260 --> 21:44.200
resistance to cold and their talent as warriors they can use a battle cry to

21:44.200 --> 21:56.460
make opponents flee fantastic and are we gonna be a man or a woman oh um okay

guess what color I am and the reason why you don't do skinny is because a skinny

23:56.700 --> 24:00.620
is possible is because the clothes texture on the shoulders can you see

24:00.620 --> 24:05.820
that you actually are better if you want less clothes a mashing to put the

24:05.820 --> 24:10.980

40:45.300 --> 40:50.020
money I don't think I think there's a shield behind here if you wanted to do yeah if you want a shield

40:50.020 --> 40:55.060
then uh there is one here but I don't really bother with shield that I do two-handed so we're

40:55.060 --> 41:00.260
going to get a warhammer very shortly eh there should be coins down here and one of these if I'm

41:00.260 --> 41:07.380
not mistaken I guess 300 no 300 coins seems a bit extreme maybe 30 coins in there and we are just

41:07.460 --> 41:17.540
going to blast through it um try two-handing mage mage is my fave no two-handed warrior two-handed

41:18.180 --> 41:23.620
lightweight warrior and you can muck around with a bow and an arrow like if you do the nightingale

41:23.620 --> 41:29.540
quest you get light armor that's pretty sneaky but the thief-skilled armor especially for this

41:29.540 --> 41:37.860
stamina and like item increase is so good um as for how we're going to tackle what we do first

41:38.420 --> 41:45.460
um I'm going to purposefully do the companion's quest line and then load a previous save because

41:45.460 --> 41:51.460
I don't like oh sorry sorry hold on I was out of stamina I was trying to reach up um that

41:51.860 --> 42:04.580
I see it just posted a very watery tweet no way the the piss corp uh accusations

42:04.580 --> 42:09.860
we ain't beating them today and we ain't beating them tomorrow and the nightingales yeah pure mage

42:09.860 --> 42:16.820
is hard mode I there should be something up here if I remember correctly on the right side of these

42:16.820 --> 42:24.420
rocks what was it oh it's just a weak coin purse I got 14 gold honestly per scaley boy he's he's

42:24.420 --> 42:31.380
gone you he couldn't get out but the bars are broken now I love the jewel wheels nightingale

42:31.940 --> 42:42.100
peeler no not peeler that's awful but that's hilarious at the same time um right there are

42:42.100 --> 42:51.700
spiders so if any of you are arachnophobic wow um don't worry they are getting absolutely yeah I've

42:51.700 --> 42:57.620
been poisoned I think they give stamina of frostbite but yeah please look away if you're arachnophobic

42:57.620 --> 43:06.420
we are just gonna blast through this area uh did I come from here uh um I think there's something

43:06.420 --> 43:14.580
to look up there maybe I don't know I can't there is a bear ahead I say look away but you're too busy

43:14.580 --> 43:17.380
doing something on your alternative twitter so it's okay

43:20.500 --> 43:26.180
she doesn't have to know and we are going to take this for some really quick money I believe

43:26.180 --> 43:33.620
there is an achievement for holding 100 000 gold at one stage the best way to make gold I have found

43:33.700 --> 43:42.180
is by enchanting and selling that jewelry um there is a bit of a mild strat that I devised

43:42.180 --> 43:49.060
myself I don't know if it's the strat uh survival mode survival adds the need absolutely not what

43:49.060 --> 43:54.740
is this survival adds the need to eat sleep and stay warm it also adds challenges such as no no

43:55.460 --> 44:01.220
and no I'm a vanilla skyrim oh my god is that is that pc option

44:04.580 --> 44:11.700
um there he goes I just realized am I not am I not getting achievements on xbox for this

44:11.700 --> 44:19.780
I don't think I am I'm not aww I named the stream zero to one thousand oops well that's a very accurate

44:20.740 --> 44:27.060
run are you playing anniversary um it's an additional challenge oh well we should have

44:27.060 --> 44:32.660
gotten an achievement there but we're not playing xbox some dumb imagine having to eat

44:32.660 --> 44:39.380
eat 10 cheese wheels um so there is a really easy mine you can clear I think it will give us two

44:39.380 --> 44:45.300
handed um that's just dead ahead it's like right in your oh wait actually sorry the standing stones

44:45.300 --> 44:52.180
first uh standing stones I believe there are 12 standing stones which give you a certain boost

44:52.180 --> 44:57.780
such as a faster leveling exp uh under certain things so there's a mage stone there's a thief

44:57.780 --> 45:03.540
stone and there is a warrior stone but there's different ones as well one uh I believe is

45:03.540 --> 45:09.380
like a mule stone where you just straight up can carry more items uh on your persons uh yeah literally

45:09.380 --> 45:17.540
activate thief activate mage activate warrior uh we are gonna do thief um are we gonna do thief

45:17.540 --> 45:24.180
what's warrior I've forgotten right we'll do warrior normally I do thief but we will we're

45:24.180 --> 45:28.980
gonna clear out this mine very quickly we're just gonna pick up uh ingredients as we go along

45:29.780 --> 45:34.580
the way of the stones the way war yeah this should be an achievement to find them all yes um

45:35.380 --> 45:42.580
um well so they're just not have achievements at all because I'm not I'm playing on xbox game

45:42.580 --> 45:51.300
pass but it's not like instance to uh xbox uh don't be too afraid of the wolves on the

45:52.740 --> 45:59.460
they are too hip they can give you rock join oh I've gone past the mine already they can give you

46:00.340 --> 46:10.660
is it no is it rock join or is it lockjaw I think it's rock join oh my memory of me

46:10.660 --> 46:16.180
I've gone so past this mineshaft yeah here we go right there should be a baddie out here hello

46:17.700 --> 46:24.980
yeah yeah yeah you're playing a novice no I'm not these accusations are unfound

46:25.620 --> 46:33.700
it is rock join I thought that but strony where is the blarney and yes I know the blarney stone

46:33.700 --> 46:39.620
what are you trying to make a balamori joke there's a tripwire here in this mine but don't

46:39.620 --> 46:46.100
worry about it as I said you can please carry them up whatever level you want I like blasting through

46:46.740 --> 46:53.380
and just absolutely annihilate and take this like it's so good there are some later stages

46:53.460 --> 46:59.780
were even being on easy mode isn't that bad although I have to admit I guess this is registering as

46:59.780 --> 47:07.780
PC Skyrim and it's quite different oh this is so sad they made this person mine themselves to death

47:08.660 --> 47:13.620
they've had me working down here for days now it's not the time that's getting to me though it's

47:13.620 --> 47:18.020
these tunnels I've told this countless times now to add extra support to the weak sections of the

47:18.020 --> 47:22.740
tunnel if only we had more of these wooden beams that were we reinforced with bronze

47:23.540 --> 47:27.380
honestly if I hear the earth shift one more time above my head I'm so stressed I may stop

47:27.380 --> 47:33.300
drinking for good I mean what's a Nord without his mead and he died because of a collapsing

47:34.260 --> 47:42.500
so my granddad was a miner and he used to tell me really rough stories about

47:43.460 --> 47:51.780
um the he is like being in the mineshaft and all of that uh and they had a mine collapse and

47:52.500 --> 47:58.500
within two minutes they had already killed the guy out and he was gone like he just perished it was

47:59.140 --> 48:08.420
a main a minor yes um they did I think bandits normally have like a lock pick and coin but

48:08.420 --> 48:16.260
that's not really the best um you can't just like straight up grab this shit but there is a big

48:16.260 --> 48:22.660
chest in here so we're just gonna clear out the wait unless we oh I was gonna say unless we sneak

48:22.660 --> 48:31.380
but the guys right there um yeah but like my granddad used to talk so openly about the um we just

48:31.380 --> 48:39.540
got it to stick oh call is oh no hold on everyone knows I'm bad at log picking now um okay we've got

48:39.540 --> 48:50.820
our first what are you 20 damage right 20 damage um he like spoke so openly about it and I'm like

48:51.700 --> 48:58.100
granddad granddad that's just straight up like stuff that's like man-made like horrors beyond

48:58.820 --> 49:01.780
comprehension type stuff uh this chest

49:04.980 --> 49:11.860
okay we're definitely on pc because amber does not look like that what the heck

49:12.740 --> 49:19.300
what the heck I've never seen that in Skyrim before am I going crazy or I don't know

49:19.860 --> 49:22.500
I'm losing it right don't get ready to swing

49:25.300 --> 49:36.660
that's so good oh um if the book is valued at 50 coins or more you will level up reading that book

49:36.660 --> 49:41.940
if you are ever in a section and you're like what the heck are all these books if that book is valued

49:41.940 --> 49:50.740
at 50 uh septum or more then it is actually a skill book oh oh my god that's so satisfying

49:51.460 --> 50:00.180
that's so freaking satisfying hold on a minute yeah that's a yeah bone archer

50:01.860 --> 50:08.100
um I think there's a tiny little chest on the edge here I think there's a little bug with a

50:08.100 --> 50:15.780
difficulty no not at all I'm playing on oh wait it's just in a vein if you didn't know um these

50:15.780 --> 50:21.300
are called veins when you can see the ore sticking out from the wall it's quite interesting honestly

50:21.300 --> 50:27.460
maybe I should talk about mining because my granddad spoke to me in big detail about it all um

50:28.900 --> 50:34.180
and like how they used to come out and like their eyes really bloodshot red and everything

50:34.900 --> 50:38.980
have I missed that chest back there I think I have but it's not a big deal

50:42.260 --> 50:47.220
yeah I thought that and I just like I was like I've missed that chest haven't I but it's fine

50:47.220 --> 50:51.780
if you run with your weapon out your stamina will decrease but that's okay you don't really need it

50:52.660 --> 50:57.780
especially when you're just so good at the game like playing legendary mode like as I'm playing

50:57.780 --> 51:02.660
right now if you didn't know I'm playing legendary mode like just because I'm such a pro everything

51:02.660 --> 51:08.340
becomes really easy and you just have to like understand the strats as long as you like swing

51:08.340 --> 51:17.380
first basically you win every fight and the reason why they hardly do any damage to me is because I

51:17.380 --> 51:23.380
have such high defense of course and not any other reason if you're looking for work go see

51:24.420 --> 51:32.100
um Rayloff said you could help me Rayloff of course you're he's a friend he promised you could

51:32.100 --> 51:40.180
help we escaped from the amperials together she lied as easily as she breathes what are you talking

51:40.180 --> 51:49.220
about this is legendary mode literally like I know it's hard to believe that a vtuber is just so

51:49.220 --> 51:55.540
good at skyrim that they can play legendary mode as casually as I can but it's just it's just the way

51:55.540 --> 52:06.980
it is okay so the area is now just discovering that dragons are coming back I don't know why

52:06.980 --> 52:12.260
but I actually believe you you've got the look of someone who's just seen the dragon legendary easy

52:12.260 --> 52:18.420
but never heard of it legendary is easy mode because I'm just so skilled at this game open

52:18.420 --> 52:26.820
options and show that it's legendary fine I will I will show that it's legendary oh look what's over

52:26.820 --> 52:33.460
there hold on what's over there look a little to the left look a little to the left see I told

52:33.460 --> 52:41.700
see I told you it was legendary I don't know see I don't know why you doubted me for a millisecond

52:41.700 --> 52:48.340

54:02.180 --> 54:07.300
than you at a game but that's okay that's okay you know I'll stroke your ego you stroke mine

other things too at the same time you know we are gonna try and hit some of these markers

54:21.940 --> 54:27.940

learned of a certain stone tablets go to bleak falls bearer we are going to bleak falls bar right

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:17.300
so this is how you make a sugar ton of money the arcane and channel we're just and you literally

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:24.100
get to level up just by destroying by destroying stuff it's pretty cool anyway we'll let them keep

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:32.100
yapping away because we're about to unlock our dragon born powers is that john skyrim from the hit

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:39.460
legendary show skyrim yeah but at the end of the fight you can decide to kill him or go away

01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:46.740
I could have sworn he attacks me on xbox I'm wondering if it's possible

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:56.820
um there might be a few courted differences battleborn give me your money I don't have any money

01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:01.620

going to go on riverwood real quick but not a big yapper as I'm actually I'm having a mental

01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:39.540
debate right now um so because we're not currently getting achievements like on steam or here

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:48.020
I'm wondering if I should do a short two hour stream then come back and do the monetization

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:56.020
stream possibly I'm having to master jabay about that um oh my god there's a firefly

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:16.500

everything is never as easy as I fall asleep there are wolves currently

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:30.820
biting my ankles but it's fine oh oh no it's not I'm gonna get lock joints perish

I'll still leave the the light armor on I know why are you doing two-handed with light armor

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:52.500

01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:24.580
make sure we don't get hurt oh I remember going up these stairs for the first time

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:27.220
and I was absolutely terrified of everything in this game

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:35.620
oh and I was I was probably oh it's probably just the baby playing on medium difficulty the default

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:41.780
uh oh don't worry we didn't actually get hit it oh we didn't get hit that was called a whiff that's

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:46.340
that's what's known as a whiff in video games don't worry don't worry we're still fine

01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:51.620
no the guy oh someone's shooting at me I heard that bone I don't

01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:56.980
can I compare something if I ever play skyrim nowadays I cheat with 300 speed

01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:03.460
and speed malt command what's that I don't even know what that is uh there should be a little

01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:11.220
dialogue do I have a bow and arrow I don't actually think I have a arrow I had the chance to pick up

01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:20.420
a bow and I didn't that's what I get for no don't worry oh we're doing the golden claw oh my god

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:24.020

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:26.900
legit just grab that stuff there should be a little chest here oh okay

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:30.820
yeah my wee glazegut kiss ah well

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:40.180

01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:51.860
we'll do tomorrow uh I'm just thinking why am I why I'm I'm so dumb and set this up but not to be

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:57.060
on xbox game pass um because I'm not getting any achievements I think we'll do I'll play for two

01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:03.940
hours and we'll redirect into sheepsters when she comes up and then I will replay everything that I

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:11.540
achieved basically oh this is supposed to be a tutorial if you don't I've just upset him he pulls

01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:23.940
it to show you that it's wrong and I think he perishes here but he's yeah yeah it's like no

01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:33.700
hell so it's uh snake snake dolphin you could just run the do the campaign and do monetization yeah

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:43.620
or yeah actually maybe um maybe we just do the main campaigns I wouldn't actually I would be quite

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:50.420
happy and satisfied with Skyrim again if the book is worth more than 50 gold if we do the main quest

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:57.620
lines instead then I would actually be happy with what we've achieved with Skyrim and we can

01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:03.140
oh my god I forgot there's rats here hold on oh I'm getting bit to death oh my gosh oh my god the

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:09.380
swing is so bad this swing is terrible I know I should level up I'm saving it if you didn't know

01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:15.620
leveling up actually fully heals you so if you ever get in a in a bit of a pickle why didn't you

01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:20.580
warn him yes actually I wouldn't mind that today we'll do an endurance stream if that's okay

01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:31.620
it's freaking terrifying oh he's actually quite a bc boy like honestly

01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:37.620
oh my god he's just stabbed me wait something else is red I don't know hi

01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:10.900
right like is this cold he's actually one of the stronger enemies in the dungeon

01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:15.220
be as a script to death and instadize where's the golden claw

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:28.900
same like a bandit attacking after takedown our dragon literally hand over the claw first

01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:34.900
okay no you're kind of real for that I'm sorry I wasn't thinking

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:42.260
hello I'm sure you wouldn't betray me would you

01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:48.100
why should I share the treasure with anyone why are you are you just leading me there

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:55.540
you feel I'm not sharing it with anyone is he about to get rolled by a drogger

01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:57.540
I see

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:04.420
he is wait sorry there's one behind me

01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:12.100
he actually does I didn't know he was scripted to do that I always kill him instantly

01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:19.300
saw mudcrabs the other day horrible creatures wait yeah so it's on his person should we read his

01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:26.500
journal left trigger read my fingers are trembling the golden claws finally in my hands and with it

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:32.100
the power of the ancient nordic heroes that fool lucian valerius has no idea that his favorite

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:38.580
store decoration was actually the key to bleak falls thorough now I just need to get to the

01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:43.860
hall of stories and unlock the door the legends say there is a test that the nord's put in place

01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:49.940
to keep the unworthy way but that when you have the golden claw the solution is in the palm of your

01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:57.220
hand oh shit okay I saw that coming I'm so sorry I saw that coming I stood right on that trap

01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:05.300
oh shit why when I use a stamina move stop holding the freaking stamina bar holy crap when I do a

01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:10.180
stamina move it like makes me go to the side literally the only thing that's going to hurt me

01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:16.500
in this game is um is uh traps nothing else

01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:23.860
spider girl for jen too

01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:31.460
so there's one I don't want to talk about it too much just for my baby girls like

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:38.340
bro we are only a weekend wait is there a drogger here I'm gonna crazy no and obviously I don't

01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:46.340
want to disrespect the baby girls um I was talking to them about like how development works behind

01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:52.900
the scenes um and unfortunately I used my words pretty poorly and it made some of them a bit

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:58.340
uncomfortable so I don't really like talking about it too much um but it's due to my poor

01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:06.900
communication it's not due to the the girls in any way um but I what I can see is that

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:19.460
development takes a year at least for a generation like an entire generation if you will um and like

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:25.460
I don't want to say too much to make the girls feel like oh I'm just like casting them aside

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:30.900
because like oh shiny gen two like you know that's absolutely not the case like I have said this from

01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:38.420
the start um if there is going to be a gen two it will be at least a year away like I am I am not

01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:43.460
rushing gens out just for the sake of doing it that's that's so unbelievably disrespectful

01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:50.580
to the girls who have placed faith in me um and like I still have a load of plans like now that

01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:56.900
the girls are in the stage of being monetized um there's a lot of plans we can now execute um like

01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:01.620
shorts as well there's a lot of shorts that need to be made um we have a fantastic uh

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:09.460
shorts editor who did a hail mary to the website and applied themselves um and he's he's been a

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:14.420
fantastic shorts editor he's pretty much done the majority of the work we have a a second one

01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:18.980
who's quite busy at the moment but we are gonna you know test if it's all good and if it's all good

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:26.020
then you know we've got a lot of shorts play coming up um confirmed not a black company I I hope

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:31.540
not I I said to the girls wholeheartedly and hopefully they will voucher they remember I said

01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:38.020
something along the lines I oh I wasn't paying attention sorry um I said if I ever do anything to

01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:46.820
you that is like absolutely hurting you that hurts you in any way that is a completely negative

01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:53.700
experience with me in any way take me out back and shoot me um like it was it's why I was very

01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:58.580
serious in the interview uh they they are welcome to talk about the interview if they like um am I

01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:06.260
gonna am I going back the way I came no I'm not um I said to them do not ever refer to me as your

01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:12.340
boss do not ever think of me as like a superior or something like that um that's definitely not

01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:18.020
ever how I want you to think like I am literally like in this with you we're we're memeing about

01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:24.820
we're figuring out what we want to do like um definitely take me out back and shoot me I'm

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:34.020
so serious do not ever ever let me like oh that's it does more damage um like do not ever take me

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:39.140
like you know what's that saying you live long enough to become the villain don't ever let me live

01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:42.900
become don't ever let me live long enough to become the villain take me out back and shoot me

01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:48.020
like oh it's why from the get go like if the girls sign on their contract for another year

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:56.420
we the company um we offer an alternative outfit on the house for them as well as their pay increase

01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:01.860
goes sorry I'm fucking trying to like remember the the attack pattern and where the droggers

01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:07.300
spawn in this uh we'll talk about this but um like uh we definitely wanted to raise their

01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:13.060
income and the split goes uh 85 15 again kind of showing that we're not really here for grade

01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:19.380
we're kind of here for alternative reasons um so is there an actual say oh I don't own the company

01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:29.780
like I genuinely wholeheartedly my my name I'm basically my role is what is a creative director

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:34.260
I already if you look on the thingy it'll tell you what the code is but you just need to move

01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:40.820
these twice and then you've got the correct code uh unless it's different on pc uh but basically I'm

01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:46.820
I was the creative director because I did used to have the scripts like I used to be the script

01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:55.380
maker I no longer have that there's no a manager all I do right now is stream as strone as me um

01:16:55.380 --> 01:17:02.420
and I send away shorts like I literally went into the girls DMs uh last night like after stream

01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:07.300
and I was like hey um can I get an audio of you saying this and they're like yeah I'll do it in

01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:14.180
the morning like that's that's all I do uh you're a cco I don't know what a cco is you're already

01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:22.980
like the opposite of a black company I mean you're ready to be dragonborn word of power

01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:34.100
learned force unrelenting force force um there's always an overlord or um some sort of um

01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:41.780
protector of the words of power which you know makes sense all things considered

01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:45.060
uh oh we're gonna break that down break it down now

01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:56.500
uh chief creative officer um no I've uh we're just gonna break everything down and

01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:03.220
I think there's a hidden chest by this waterfall although I could be completely wrong oh well no

01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:08.260
damn my memory coming through it's been how many years since I played this game and I'm like

01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:11.940
yeah there's a we hidden chest here then there's a there and then you can pick this up and then

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:22.180
do that oh my god so mlg pro honestly um wow you executed that based on honestly foos sounds like

01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:28.820
the german word foo which means foot oh did you like my foos last night huh did did you like them

01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:36.740
streams tell me I don't have I feel so feminine right now I'm like the most feminine I might get

01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:42.660
more pedicures gonna say that that was so fun I enjoyed it the women was so like both the women

01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:48.580
were so lovely I felt so flustered in that stream though I hope it didn't come across too badly but

01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:56.820
I was like so out of my element like when I saw the time was an hour until uh sheepsters was up I

01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:01.940
was like oh my god what have I done like how did I speedrun it it's like so quickly

01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:12.420
have you got back the tool um it's still unfortunately very uh cut up so I've still

01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:20.420
got a wee band-aid on it I washed it uh in the bath uh she got me good all I'm gonna say is she

01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:25.700
got me good like it was deep you know like the side the smaller side part of your tool cut straight

01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:32.580
into that she was really sorry though but it's fine like stuff happens honestly and I believe she

01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:37.780
was new I believe she was new to the establishment so it's better to it's better for her to make a

01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:41.940
mistake on me because like hopefully I'm nice and understand and they're like I didn't say anything

01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:46.740
mean I was like oh you're fine like don't worry about it um and like the other women was like

01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:50.580
translating for her because she didn't speak English and I was like it's fine so I'm kind of

01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:55.220
glad she made that mistake on me rather than someone else who would have been like a Karen

01:19:55.220 --> 01:20:03.460
basically like I'm not gonna say anything about Australia but um I have I have heard some unique

01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:23.860
to hang about strony has the wrong kind of tism to pay attention to multiple things that was yeah

01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:29.460
I can't do that I can like hyper I say they call it hyper focused I don't think it's even hyper

01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:36.500
focused it I'm not focused at all I'm just having a really good time um but yeah I'm very lucky that

01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:42.900
I don't experience like burnout or anything I'm like yeah I can't really oh sorry oh I'm so sorry

01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:49.700
to hear that you're having such a tough time oh yeah um right hold on I'm gonna unlock this

01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:58.580
little windmill as a landmarker when you pepega farm that's terrible when you discover a landmark

01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:06.020
you can fast travel to it which gets you around a lot faster um

01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:14.020
did you know that with frostbills you can make dragons land I did not know that I always use that

01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:22.340
shout um to get them to land oh it's so pretty look at the butterfly oh my god catch the butterfly

01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:31.860
rip its wings off for alchemy yes oh purple butterfly he didn't serve it okay now we need

01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:37.380
to wait for the game to hurry up with the npc so we're just gonna wait an hour oh there we go boom

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:46.180
just like that no burnout lucky you I just don't experience it I like I've never experienced

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:53.540
issues with that I don't feel it like I can feel tired like I can be like oh I need to go get some

01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:58.740
like tea and some food and then we'll play like for a couple of more hours I can do that no problem

01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:06.020
like at all I think the only time I feel I just feel frustrated that I don't have more time like

01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:12.100
when I was doing all the ASMR collabs like writing all the scripts back to back and actually I knew

01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:16.580
girl uh I'm used to tell a new girl and I was like hey you want to do some more and she was like

01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:21.060
fuck you want to do some more and she's like I know a lot about you and I was like oh that's

01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:26.020
embarrassing um but if you know a lot about me then you know how easy this collab is gonna be

01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:32.180
because I'll do all the work um but like I don't mind doing all the work if anyone's lurking

01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:38.260
I don't mind doing the work I actually prefer it um because it makes things a lot easier

01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:44.420
and make every arrow count I used to not experience burnout playing games but now I do which is a

01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:51.380
shame no so if you can't play video games that's like life burnout like if you would rather watch

01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:57.780
someone else play video games then like play it yourself livestreaming doesn't count because you're

01:24:57.780 --> 01:25:03.860
you're being tortured to watch me play Skyrim via uh my controller where the heck is this dragon

01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:13.540
is he on the floor oh it is okay oh let's spank his butt uh whoa it's actually kind of hurt me a

01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:23.700
little bit no you're stinking you're so stinking um see I've been on top here stamina bar is

01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:34.100
greed out only HP oh it's landed again oh you're hurting me stop it you're hurting me

01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:40.180
oh look at that two-handed 32 I should probably level that up we are gonna pick up the dragon

01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:47.060
bones these are like why on earth oh he must eat a weight ring guard um dovahki no

01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:53.220
uh so now this is where the NPCs get really weird around you I don't know what he's fighting

01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:59.140
right now he's locked on something a mud crab maybe nearby there's mud crabs over that way

01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:08.260
today I learned from a Scottish cuttlefish I may have burned out yes so if you'd rather um if you

01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:11.220
would rather um

01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:23.460
he's supposed to come up to me is it you

01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:36.420
normally an NPC walks up to you and goes oh my god you are the dragon born in a really

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:38.340
poor like Swedish accent

01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:46.740
what type of two-handed we specialize in in hammer, axe, sword those there's

01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:54.340
aren't those one-handed yeah I'm just gonna pick up with the apocrity apocrity something like that

01:26:55.140 --> 01:26:59.700
did he die I guess they may have perished yeah I've been uninspired by the games to play recent

01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:05.220
so I'd prefer watching others like yes I think that is a symptom of burnout because of

01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:09.060
the

01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:16.100
I think the gray beards have summoned us

01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:24.100
oh it's Khajiit who's a good boy hey push push push

01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:31.460
do you seek to make a purchase uh uh what have you got for sale I'm gonna just sell some of my stuff

01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:35.940
that I don't want uh I'm gonna break that break it down now

01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:44.500
I'm gonna break all this stuff down it's just so we're not too heavy and I can break those down

01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:52.980
take red did that red did that we're gonna break it down I've got a brook bass and a Nord meat

01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:59.940
resurrect and restore my energy would I do amber I'll just sell it I don't I don't really know

01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:06.740
oh I definitely want to sell this I like how my speech gets better just selling stuff in general

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:13.620
like you always want to hold on to soul gems they're very important may the road lead to oh

01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:18.020
that's why I always say safe travels land strider because of this game I think is really cute just

01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:27.860
safe travels land strider khajiit roleplay stream uh I actually don't know how to pur you know how

01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:35.700

01:28:56.740 --> 01:29:02.180
so they're looking for uh someone but we're not doing that quest right now because we're

01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:10.820
trying to zoom past this so we can go and do the main quest of the dragonborn I'm wearing a hat with

01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:20.740
badass horns I'm the dover king known globally you're nobody at home he was so English in those

01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:26.660
songs for no reason I'm just kidding it is his accent he's allowed to have an accent

01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:34.900
if it's gosh I'm dover king known globally you're nobody at all like it yeah I think the English

01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:43.620
rapping accent is a bit better than the scots was the dragon there uh the watch tower was

01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:48.900
destroyed but we killed the dragon let's just skip a few dialogue and see it turns out I might be

01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:58.340
dragonborn dragonborn what do you know about the dragonborn when the dragon died I absorbed some

01:29:58.340 --> 01:30:05.620
kind of power so it's true the gray beards really were summoning you the vampire DLC I don't even

01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:11.540

01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:36.980
mis-input mis-input please don't fight me I didn't mean to do that I was uh the wrong

01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:43.620
wrong button there uh axe of white run target dies within three second fills a soul gem

01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:48.660
that's perfect because it's exactly the enchantment we want we're gonna break break it down now

01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:57.860
just breaking down everything um and we're gonna see if we can enchant our Nordic battle axe

01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:01.700
although I even have soul gem I have the world's weakest soul gem

01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:06.740
I'm gonna have to refill it so much if I end up using it

01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:14.820
uh this is the best I can do

01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:23.060
uh we're just gonna oh we're completely out of soul gems anyway

01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:33.060
I'm sorry it was a mis-input it was a mis-input I'm so sorry look I'm the I'm the thing anyway

01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:14.020
nose and lips and everything that is hilarious I'm so sorry Lydia I'm just such a I must have like

01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:21.620
subconsciously made her this that shirt is making people nervous on it I'm still winning

01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:28.980
Lydia cuttles for real for real right we now need to go all the way up this mount well we need to

01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:33.060
go to Rorik's stead I versus it oh my god I'm such a fake gamer honestly I don't even know why you

01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:42.020
guys listen to me half the time uh 20's copied my whole flow word for word bar for bar it's a

01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:47.860
highland coup excuse me little gate let me just close that let me just close that oh it's the wee

01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:56.820
highland coup look at this no uh whoa whoa whoa look at yidwi horns fun uh I mentioned this other

01:32:56.820 --> 01:33:03.700
day actually uh I had a relative that owned one and uh the they they're actually super gentle

01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:11.060
uh but it made my relative blind in one eye lamal uh because the horn poked his eyeball um that was

01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:18.420
funny uh but he wasn't even mad at her it was a female highland coup I can't even remember what

01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:22.340
he named there but honestly it sounds like the most Scottish you know I don't care about your

01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:30.500
question the fuck up um literally I honestly must sound so Scottish a stream like oh my grandad

01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:35.700
used to work in the mines uh had a family that family member that literally owned a highland coup

01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:39.540
like oh my god that's where like no wonder I was raised in a bar and literally don't have manners

01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:47.460
like I just I never had it from the start a wee coup a wee highland coup my favorite part of a

01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:55.300
strong stream is our unofficial catchphrase did you know oh did you know did you know uh right I

01:33:55.300 --> 01:34:00.180
think we're gonna manually walk there there are gonna be wolves ahead but because we're playing

01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:07.220
legendary differently and I'm such an MLG pro at this game um it's honestly not problem and

01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:12.260
we might even see Cicero on the way it's unlikely we'll meet Cicero on the way there just because

01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:19.540
he spawns I find the Cicero spawns more northern west of the map and we are her and like going

01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:29.780
southern east which is the opposite um Lydia no hello this was as stupid as a feud with clan

01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:38.500
need something no oh oh she's got a bit of them oh what was that shadow freaking the honeybearing

01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:44.340
meadery ah yes a bit of a bit of meadery oh wait will we open a veal or a meadery why not

01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:51.620
that seems to be the way of like um content creators when they get in their end game they

01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:59.780
like come out with a product I'm like I think my end game would be video games like uh like paying

01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:06.340
to get them made like what what my my rubbish ideas are um I think that's probably my end game whoa

01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:14.260
okay that was that was a lot going on the screen for one for one soul that was quite a lot there is

01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:20.980
a waste on up ahead I don't think it's a good one Haggis and nips and ties

01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:26.740
do you also live in a lone terror up on some hill are you

01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:32.740
wait oh no is this an enemy dog no it's a nice dog hello I've been hunting and fishing in these parts

01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:40.020
for years I've been hunting and fishing in these parts for years are you telling me my lore story

01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:45.780
is shrek right now you can buy dragon scale you've not got the money for it all right

01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:54.740
veal or drinks it may or may not contain something unique to the girls I see that

01:35:54.740 --> 01:36:01.780
skiver on the road don't think I can't see you oh so captured that that is the noise I like to

01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:08.980
hear honestly I believe there's a few skeletons up on this hill but again nothing we can't handle

01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:15.700
nothing you can't handle at all um as I said we're gonna do the main quest we're gonna do

01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:25.060
the thieves um and then hello are you you are definitely an enemy oh I do beg your pardon but

01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:32.340
it's all the way absolutely nothing around these parts and another soul capture do you have soul

01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:42.740
gem spark white cat um we'll destroy those oh oh oh how dare you do you oh wait I think that

01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:50.420
ancient that ancient bow is stronger than what we have for our bow um right we're skeleton scare

01:36:50.420 --> 01:37:00.420
ooh scary are you squid me right by the pope I don't like my family history every time I read my

01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:07.780
family history I always have to ask myself are we the bad guys thank you for the tip

01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:18.740
I think my family history is like really boring it's just like yeah Scottish and Irish

01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:27.460
I know that you can do like 23 and me tests to like really see where you come from but I actually

01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:34.660
don't uh I don't believe it's safe at all to like willingly hand over your DNA like that look

01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:38.900
I know I'm starting to send like needy streamer overload where we're doing like that god speed

01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:44.100
run where she you know she got into like all the conspiracy theories and stuff but it's not really

01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:50.260
a conspiracy theory right I like maybe I should do a stream like that unironically I'll like yeah

01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:55.140
um wait what are you attacking you're not attacking me no you're not okay that's strange

01:37:55.220 --> 01:38:02.740
uh the scaly sounded like an oblivion scaly at least you got a cool accent out of the deal yeah

01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:08.420
and we are just running our way over to mvark said I believe is the town name of where

01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:15.220
you kind of forgot the pronunciation um nah I don't think it's safe either type your DNA

01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:25.220
on fail the company yeah like um I took like ethics class um and we were discussing like

01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:30.820
how good like emerging technology is like if you haven't heard about crisper is DNA fixing

01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:36.660
technology essentially DNA fixing um it's going through a lot of lab studies and trials and all

01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:43.460
that but it's found very effective against like um you know things that were previously incurable

01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:51.940
essentially or diseases that are uh untreatable that kind of thing um and the technology that

01:38:51.940 --> 01:39:01.620
can be raised from it um to help people is outstanding however do we do we trust such

01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:09.460
do we trust your DNA sequence to be handled with care or would in theory insurance help

01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:16.180
I'm sorry I'm literally hell yeah I'm up for scotland conspiracy theory stream thank you so much

01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:22.500
totally not Virginia um like I could definitely get into it but we were like talking about like

01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:28.420
uh didn't see one of the industry companies get caught selling all the data they said they

01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:36.340
wouldn't is that yes uh not to mention um there's like a whole rabbit hole about what data leaks are

01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:45.540
um because um I don't know I don't know if you guys care but um there's actually a whole other

01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:52.900
conspiracy um that data leaks aren't actually like that it's kind of more like government demands

01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:57.700
to have access but they already kind of have access so a lot of things especially with the

01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:02.100
technology in the state age but uh maybe I shouldn't go too far down the rabbit hole don't want to

01:40:02.100 --> 01:40:06.820
deter anyone where the heck am I supposed to go I think there's a path ahead I'll just follow this

01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:13.940
path um I thought we were going down the designer baby route oh well that already happened one of

01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:20.420
the biggest examples of the designer baby route was victoria beckham's children you're telling me

01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:27.460
that brown eyed lady has a 25 percent of uh blue eyed offspring and she just happened to pop out

01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:36.260
to blue eyed children uh no she did what is called ivf and then the dna tested and checked if the

01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:44.260
children and in the egg in the egg yes in the egg uh were able to uh had the recessive blue eyes

01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:48.820
it has already been done in this day and age and that was back in 2005 or something crazy it's one

01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:53.620
of the biggest public uh things that are right in the faces of people that you wouldn't know about

01:40:53.620 --> 01:41:00.260
it's already occurring today this also occurs with the fox p12 gene I believe I'm so sorry if no one

01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:04.900
cares about this but I'll try and get through it really quickly there's also a gene that's been identified

01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:10.020
called the fox p12 I believe um and if you have it it means you're actually a lot smarter and able

01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:15.700
to pick up things a lot easier than someone who is without this gene and it's been called into question

01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:20.340
that IVF babies may also be getting tested for this so you have a child or offspring that may be a

01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:26.660
bit smarter than the average girl but that's just on me okay uh I'll just leave it I'll leave it there

01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:33.780
but there there's a lot there's a lot okay um it's really interesting to continue the

01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:38.820
happen yes so a lot of people think it hasn't already occurred or the first human hasn't been

01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:44.740
cloned and dolly the first sheep was cloned in 1964 I believe uh the no no no no no that's when

01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:51.380
we first were publicly allowed to be learned and to be taught about the cloning um it's already

01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:58.500
happened long ago you just don't get to know about it because ethnically it's messed ethnically

01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:04.820
ethically it's messed up and the public shouldn't really be allowed to access this knowledge because

01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:10.340
well it brings up a lot of questions such as if you clone a person do they have one soul do they

01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:14.740
share soul and then it brings religion into question if you didn't know religion also helps bring in

01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:19.460
a lot of order into people's and communities lives and the rabbit hole goes incredibly deep but we

01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:23.140
can't touch on that subject too much because I'm just a vtuber playing skyrim right now and we're

01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:27.460
just trying to get to everything so we can talk to the greybeards to learn about our true powers

01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:37.380
the dragonborn as we play this game so yes please don't mind me uh oh there's a saber cat after me

01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:45.620
my goodness um but yes uh please uh please let us enjoy skyrim for what it is but anyway that's

01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:52.340
why I don't really start talking about these subjects uh because uh yeah it's uh it's a bit

01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:58.820
scary it's a bit scary when you look into it yeah right uh yeah gamers for genetically engineered

01:42:58.820 --> 01:43:04.180
cat girls represent absolutely I'm 100% there with you the fact that nickel girls aren't real

01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:07.940
I used to right this sounds really bad I used to actually fantasize about owning a nickel girl

01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:14.340
I don't know why I just I used to fantasize about like treating her really well and like

01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:18.340
she would have had a previous owner before me or something but I'll be like I'll treat you right

01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:24.820
baby I don't know why I give me like some sort of like superior like saving complex or something

01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:30.340
I don't know why but like I just oh I used to fantasize about all of that like especially

01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:41.940
after watching monster monster um I used to like really uh there should be a quest

01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:49.380
where you deliver something for someone is it you here for work get an axe and bring me all the

01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:56.980
wood you can chop oh okay right sorry jeez um if this dream doesn't demonstrate that the

01:43:56.980 --> 01:44:01.860
Tism is strong and veiler literally tiffin box there's someone that gives you a quest

01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:14.980
oh the graybeards 10 not well it's trouble is my legs aren't okay we're gonna yet if you talk to

01:44:14.980 --> 01:44:24.740
this guy you can do a quest for him um there's also a hidden thing if you read all of these on the

01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:28.420
way up something happens but I've completely forgotten what happens because I've never done it

01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:35.540
before because I saw it in a video and I've forgotten what happened in the video uh right let's see

01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:44.420
emblem one before the birth of men the dragons ruled all of montus their words their word was the

01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:51.140

01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:36.180

get poisoned but that's just me anyway if anyone's wondering why i really like need to shoot my

02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:10.260
and you can't resurrect the freaking thing so you need to wait until they come and attack you

02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:13.620

02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:15.300
questline as well vampire thieves guild and main quests where the storm cloaks win in the end

02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:19.940
yes please i think i will be very satisfied with their skyrim adventures doing that

02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:28.660
clear cut and we're not kind of stuck with the hill come on there we go uh that definitely because

02:08:29.300 --> 02:08:35.540

02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:53.380

that for the first time and just being blown away like i loved everything about her i'm

02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:28.660
such an edgy little child such an edgy little beast um so i didn't want players to have too

02:09:28.660 --> 02:09:34.900
much fun and they couldn't keep buying the new versions of skyrim honestly uh there is a forest

02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:44.340

02:17:10.180 --> 02:17:14.340
wants to talk to you at once when you enter rift and i have to admit it's a bit of a sensory

02:17:14.340 --> 02:17:19.540
bit of a cheeky sensory overload entering in your city and skyrim everyone wants to talk to you

02:17:21.380 --> 02:17:29.220
right uh how could you possibly know that i'm a thief right i'm gonna tell you something you

02:17:29.220 --> 02:17:36.020
should absolutely not do maybe you'd like a taste the game is going to ask you to plan a ring on

02:17:36.020 --> 02:17:44.100
this person and it locks him up in jail and removes um a seller from rifting don't do it

02:17:46.340 --> 02:17:53.780
don't do it okay if you do it it removes him as a seller and it's like another 800 coins you

02:17:53.780 --> 02:17:58.820
can't get from selling stuff these symbols you see around the city um these are thieves guild

02:17:58.820 --> 02:18:04.260
symbols you'll see them everywhere it means this place has been marked or there's something of value

02:18:04.260 --> 02:18:09.220
inside like you'll see the symbols everywhere and you always want to fail this quest it doesn't matter

02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:12.820

02:18:15.300 --> 02:18:19.380

02:25:00.500 --> 02:25:07.060
but i suppose that's just how it goes but never mind that even though you fouled up the job i still

02:25:08.420 --> 02:25:14.500
maybe we get some food and a cup of tea shortly if you're up to the challenge no water i've not

02:25:14.500 --> 02:25:19.700

02:36:40.740 --> 02:36:43.160
this recruit possesses an aptitude for our line of work

02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:51.160
So let her prove it. Let her prove it. Let her prove it.

02:36:51.160 --> 02:36:57.160
However, the owner has suddenly decided to take matters into his own hands and shut us out.

02:36:57.160 --> 02:37:00.160
He needs to be taught a lesson.

02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:03.160
A lesson?

02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:08.160
Mercer, aren't you forgetting something?

02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:11.160

02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:14.160
Oh, I get my outfit. Okay, look at the drip.

02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:19.160
Zero minus aura, zero risk, no gift.

02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:22.160
I'm expecting you to make us a lot of coin.

02:37:22.160 --> 02:37:25.160
Wait, don't I get my outfit yet?

02:37:25.160 --> 02:37:28.160
Simple. Do as you're told and keep your blade.

02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:30.160
Outfit? Outfit check?

02:37:30.160 --> 02:37:32.160

Alright, tell me about the job.

02:37:53.160 --> 02:37:54.160
Makes sense.

02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:56.160
Right, we're just beginning our first Thieves Guild assignment.

02:37:56.160 --> 02:37:59.160
Basically, we're destroying beehives.

02:37:59.160 --> 02:38:03.160
We literally said, yeah, we see the problems with environment, not our problem.

02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:05.160
We are going to go talk to...

02:38:05.160 --> 02:38:11.160
I've already forgotten her name, but she's in here and she's going to give us...

02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:15.160
Has my OBS just died?

02:38:15.160 --> 02:38:20.160
Am I still streaming?

02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:23.160
Has my connection just died? Please don't.

02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:26.160
Please don't do this right now, to me, connection.

02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:27.160
Hold on.

02:38:27.160 --> 02:38:28.160
I think my...

02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:29.160
Oh, dear.

02:38:29.160 --> 02:38:30.160
Oh, dear.

02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:31.160
Oh, dear.

02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:34.160
It's not looking bloody good for us, is it?

02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:42.160
I just got an error message saying I'm not on VTIP Studio for some reason.

02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:44.160
But you guys were saying you see me.

02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:49.160
Oh, dear.

02:38:53.160 --> 02:38:54.160
Oh, dear.

02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:55.160
Right.

02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:58.160
I'm still here.

02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:01.160
I'm still here for some reason.

02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:03.160
It thinks I'm offline.

02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:06.160
That's mildly concerning.

02:39:06.160 --> 02:39:07.160
Right.

02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:08.160
It's mildly concerning.

02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:09.160
But it's fine.

02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:10.160
It's fine.

02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:11.160
Right.

02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:12.160
We're Tonya.

02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:13.160
Up in the donya.

02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:14.160

02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:23.160
Tonya.

02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:25.160
I remember her saying that.

02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:35.160
Two lovers.

02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:37.160
Forbidden from one another.

02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:41.160

Zero negative versus negative drip.

covers up all the flavor i work with my mother to sell first time vegetable that anyone are you okay

02:52:12.200 --> 02:52:15.560
i know it's scary i know it's scary to go into a new place for the first time but you'll be all

02:52:15.560 --> 02:52:23.400
right and then you buddy just stop the fire take a seat and get the cold out oh my gosh i love it

02:52:23.480 --> 02:52:30.120

jeez you look his eyes i've got like eye shadow on i'm gonna keep this

02:52:38.200 --> 02:52:45.640
so we're to basically poison the bat from a meadery in order to get this guy arrested

02:52:46.360 --> 02:52:55.480
it's pretty pretty yeah it's pretty deep plot i have to admit the plot is so deep like it's

02:52:55.480 --> 02:53:05.880
probably i'd say an average of five inches deep of this plot um shut up just shut up um i will make

02:53:05.880 --> 02:53:09.720
a tea and get some food in me because i think i'm starting to go slightly delirious because i've not

02:53:09.720 --> 02:53:15.320
had anything i'm supposed to be holding a tasting of the new hunting so if he sees the meadery in this

02:53:15.320 --> 02:53:24.520
state there's currently skeevers and at his meadery and we're gonna offer some well that's not how i

02:53:24.520 --> 02:53:33.720
operate so you better or i'll yell skeever okay okay no need to make rash decision here's half my only

02:53:34.680 --> 02:53:41.800
how do i permanent so he is literally handing us the poison that we're gonna poison the bat of

02:53:41.800 --> 02:53:53.880
mead with it's it's it's so evil i love it please eat get that nutrition you i just get so distracted

when i stream like i don't oh fucking hell um i just uh oh sorry sorry i'm

02:54:03.240 --> 02:54:08.120
it's all a bit pear shaped hasn't it uh yeah i just like kind of forget to eat and stuff

02:54:08.760 --> 02:54:13.160
when i stream i just get so distracted because it's like such a good time i've always been like

02:54:13.160 --> 02:54:28.280
oh my gosh oh all right i'm on the red oh you can't even see my health bar

02:54:29.720 --> 02:54:34.520
oh wow my health bar is really bad right now uh i'll show you how bad it is i can i can heal

02:54:34.520 --> 02:54:41.080
right now that's how bad it oh maybe i need to adjust my chat so it doesn't go over the screen

02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:47.720
especially for video games like this i might get that change

02:54:50.360 --> 02:54:56.440
uh spaking the honeybrew mead with emmy needs honestly emmy needs delightfully

02:54:56.440 --> 02:55:03.080
did emmy would cry for it it's not bad you're no hit legendary i am

02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:09.640
okay hold on lidia you lidia

02:55:11.880 --> 02:55:18.040
lidia you literally went around the room what do you mean by over the screen so you see how like

02:55:18.040 --> 02:55:24.600
next to me is that little cuttlefish to my to your left i guess from your pop see how the chat is

02:55:24.600 --> 02:55:30.120
like going up on screen from that chat box i might change it so it doesn't so the video game isn't

02:55:30.280 --> 02:55:35.400
um like encroached in any way because i just noticed now that you can't see my health bar

02:55:36.120 --> 02:55:43.160
um you can see my stamina constantly but my big hairs oh oh sorry there's traps sorry sorry

02:55:43.160 --> 02:55:49.560
oh sorry sorry oh oh lidia lidia there's traps like did you not just hear me jump over them lidia

02:55:52.280 --> 02:55:58.840
oh right this fight always scares me because this guy is actually super OP for no reason

02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:04.760
there's a man in here oh we need to we need to get him first because i have like no magic

02:56:04.760 --> 02:56:11.960
oh bruv bruv hold on all right i'll get the rats first he is like so strong for no reason

02:56:13.080 --> 02:56:18.360
and he freaking does that where he fucking backs off i hate when you back off when you're

02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:21.800
fighting them like i know that's normal to back off when someone's like coming at you

02:56:22.440 --> 02:56:27.400
but it's so annoying just stand still and let me parachute it's like not that big a deal

02:56:27.400 --> 02:56:35.160
yeah so that man was currently living with the the skevers um you know as long as he's happy

02:56:35.160 --> 02:56:43.800
and thriving that's the main thing but uh no a little to the right no no a little to the left

02:56:44.680 --> 02:56:48.280
a bit more no a little bit more to the left

02:56:49.240 --> 02:56:54.680
oh he's a mage yeah we hate mages honestly there's so annoying

02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:05.320
male version of ime oh i mean ow i keep getting wrecked by these traps like i've like forgotten

02:57:05.320 --> 02:57:11.000
them all right we'll finish this quest and then i will get some food in me because i'm probably

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:15.160
moments from perishing uh you can just grab this key but here by the way super easy um

02:57:15.400 --> 02:57:20.440
um i totally didn't know that on my first playthrough and walked all the way back uh

02:57:21.240 --> 02:57:27.160
like a dumb dumb no i don't want to steal from it it's honestly kind of picking up stolen items

02:57:27.160 --> 02:57:33.240
is really annoying if the guards end up picking you up right we've done it we've done the quest

02:57:33.240 --> 02:57:38.120
once we finish we'll take a look if you need to sample some of the finest mead in skyline

02:57:38.920 --> 02:57:44.920
that your shift hasn't even started yet when i'm hello well it's about time

02:57:45.960 --> 02:57:50.040
you'll just have to wait until after the camp right we're gonna watch it all we're gonna

02:57:50.040 --> 02:57:58.280
watch it all in furl lydia go take a seat there lydia go sit lydia sit

02:58:01.160 --> 02:58:07.080
what do you need go sit okay got it well

02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:13.720
now that you've taken care of your i said go sit you're ruining the view lydia even though you

02:58:13.720 --> 02:58:20.920
look just like me it's my finest room yet i call it the hate game from 2011 are you planning on

02:58:20.920 --> 02:58:27.640
playing the elton ring dlc yeah we're you when it comes out we're replaying the full game again

02:58:27.640 --> 02:58:34.280

02:58:34.280 --> 02:58:39.800
ring so i do apologize to anyone who hates elton ring i will probably have like a shorter stream

02:58:39.800 --> 02:58:48.520
and maybe do like a membership stream as well and switch it up maybe she doesn't like to be told

02:58:48.520 --> 02:58:51.400

02:58:51.400 --> 02:59:01.480

02:59:02.840 --> 02:59:10.280
just turn the music down a tiny bit yeah it's a bit overwhelming you're like in fights and stuff

02:59:11.560 --> 02:59:16.840
this is not what it seems but bouncing are we actually doing but bouncing i don't know

03:02:54.920 --> 03:03:00.680

03:03:01.320 --> 03:03:08.040
i blink and you'll miss it honestly here comes airplane i found the same marking at the honey

03:03:08.040 --> 03:03:16.120
broom eatery you admire them just don't mistake how can we make them pay

03:03:16.120 --> 03:03:23.880
name is gullama gullama i'm betty get out there shake him down shake him down shake him down

03:03:29.720 --> 03:03:36.280
uh i need to talk to brinjalph again hi brinjalph i can't believe gullama is mixed up in all this

03:03:36.280 --> 03:03:42.840
gullama not to be confused with golem a don't get me wrong you could scam a beggar

03:03:42.840 --> 03:03:49.240
how about i recite the work even more and oh i reduced the work even more and chew it for me

03:03:49.240 --> 03:03:55.800
do you know that's how um used to food babies back in the day um it's actually really common for the

03:03:55.800 --> 03:04:05.800
mums to chew the food and then give it to the um sorry um yeah so like before baby formula was a

03:04:05.800 --> 03:04:12.040
thing and like solid food training or whatever like before the again a capitalism market kind of

03:04:12.040 --> 03:04:18.280
exploded went to hear about what nesli did um yeah it was like really common your mom

03:04:18.280 --> 03:04:22.520
chose the food for you and then gives it to you in your mouth it's like a little baby bird moment

03:04:22.520 --> 03:04:27.400
and everyone's like that's so gross and i was like bro that's the way it is it's just like how how

03:04:27.400 --> 03:04:32.520
it be you know it's very interesting i actually could probably write an entire video i say about it

03:04:32.520 --> 03:04:36.920
and then present that video i say live on stream and just to show everyone how natural things are

03:04:36.920 --> 03:04:41.320
but everything's been so like oh they're so weird but it's only weird because we've not been exposed

03:04:41.400 --> 03:04:45.720
and we no longer even talk about it because it's like literally unironically being bred out of us

03:04:45.720 --> 03:04:52.360
over a few generations because capitalism is away um what one fun world stroney did you consider

03:04:52.360 --> 03:05:01.720
getting mana as backup food yeah mummy bird and literally i didn't know that was a thing it is so

03:05:02.280 --> 03:05:10.040
um uh babies newborns should start on breast milk because it's full of colostrum um and it's

03:05:10.040 --> 03:05:14.840
also because a baby doesn't actually have an immune system until six months old um so it's

03:05:14.840 --> 03:05:19.880
very important to have breast milk however um it was very common to have what's called a wet nurse

03:05:19.880 --> 03:05:25.800
which is when um a woman who had recently had a child uh would share um because it's very common

03:05:25.800 --> 03:05:31.720
for some women to experience a surplus and it's very common for some women to experience uh

03:05:31.720 --> 03:05:36.600
problems producing milk it's just kind of random doesn't really there's a lot of factors that come

03:05:36.600 --> 03:05:42.040
into play um obviously stress is a major one stress on any human body for a long period do you

03:05:42.040 --> 03:05:51.080
mind i'm telling a story about tiddy milk leave me alone um but yes uh i'm sure as a lot of you

03:05:51.080 --> 03:05:57.160
can imagine being stressed for a very long time is very bad for your health um guys uh guys uh

03:05:57.160 --> 03:06:03.960
stress manifests in a lot of mental health issues and a lot of loneliness um

03:06:03.960 --> 03:06:13.240
um oh are we gonna make it you know what we're gonna send it send it right hold on hold on

03:06:13.240 --> 03:06:16.520
let them fake them out a little fake them out fake them out fake them out it's fine

03:06:17.800 --> 03:06:25.560
wow wait wrong one oh shit i'm out of stamina and he's like right next to me this is rather

03:06:25.560 --> 03:06:31.720
embarrassing i have to admit uh i didn't really think this far through yeah stress got me pretty good

03:06:31.720 --> 03:06:37.800
yeah i like it here because i learned so much information okay there we go we can get away

03:06:39.080 --> 03:06:44.760
worse i hear it i don't see it i think that's good that i don't see it though because it means it's

03:06:44.760 --> 03:06:50.280
not near me don't call me out like that yeah it's very um interest in the way it physically

03:06:50.280 --> 03:06:54.760
manifests in the way like obviously i think the majority of us have been like raised in a western

03:06:54.760 --> 03:07:00.120
society which obviously comes with a lot of socialization and socialization plays so much

03:07:00.120 --> 03:07:06.680
into the how you can deal with stress factors and like it's just kind of a sad fact that like

03:07:06.680 --> 03:07:12.520
homeboys uh kind of get told to suck it up um like i can literally go greeting to the girls

03:07:12.520 --> 03:07:17.560
right now and it's like nothing nothing's wrong with it or anything um but it's very interesting

03:07:17.560 --> 03:07:21.000
how you tackle it i don't even know how you tackle it i wouldn't even have a clue where you start

03:07:21.800 --> 03:07:26.600
like the only thing i guess you could hope for is pockets of communities and over time ideas get

03:07:26.600 --> 03:07:33.720
popular like um when the general consensus of society changes that's when the real change comes

03:07:33.720 --> 03:07:39.320
through but the problem is you have to basically go out with the old and how do you go out with the

03:07:39.320 --> 03:07:46.360
old well the the old passes away the old doesn't bring down it bring down the old doesn't pass on

03:07:46.360 --> 03:07:52.840
its teachings like for example um i like my grandparents talked about how they got hit by

03:07:52.840 --> 03:07:57.880
their parents um it was a very common place to be hit if you didn't know it's actually illegal

03:07:57.880 --> 03:08:04.360
to punish your child via a corporal punishment yes your own child in scotland is legal and you

03:08:04.360 --> 03:08:09.160
will be prosecuted for hitting them no it is not punishment no it is not spanking no it is

03:08:09.960 --> 03:08:13.720
literally against the law you're welcome to go up and it's very bad for the child

03:08:13.800 --> 03:08:23.640
there's a lot of things done around it um but it's very fascinating um how quickly things can

03:08:23.640 --> 03:08:28.200
change within a generation so my grandparents told me stories about them getting hit by their parents

03:08:28.200 --> 03:08:34.840
they did not hit my parents like they didn't hit mom and dad and then you know opposites i didn't

03:08:34.840 --> 03:08:42.760
hit mom and dad and mom or dad so my mom spanked me so my dad never hit me he doesn't like it he

03:08:42.760 --> 03:08:50.680
doesn't believe in it and he absolutely despises it my mom so there was this orange slipper

03:08:50.680 --> 03:08:55.480
and she used to hit me with it all the time because it was such a low child um

03:08:57.160 --> 03:09:05.800
but it's very interesting because um within a couple of generations in scotland it's a big

03:09:05.800 --> 03:09:11.640
no no to discipline your children via punishment like that physical punishment um and it's just

03:09:11.640 --> 03:09:16.360
like interesting to see as the generations come and go like some people might not like the emphasis

03:09:16.360 --> 03:09:21.720
like oh if you're in this age range you're gen x if you're in this you're a zoomer you're this you're

03:09:21.720 --> 03:09:29.240
that but the reason it is so purposeful and so important to have these names for generations

03:09:29.240 --> 03:09:40.120
is because there's also a lot of societal behaviors that emerge i hear nin root i hear it yes um and

03:09:41.080 --> 03:09:48.120
uh so like you who are listening to me right now odds are we were not raised in the exact same

03:09:48.120 --> 03:09:57.320
society with the expectations and whatever's however we are crazy enough to have the ability

03:09:57.320 --> 03:10:06.520
to set up a community like main where we may agree on how things like should go and how things

03:10:06.520 --> 03:10:18.440
shouldn't go and we have created a pocket a pocket of a collective that can provide secondary

03:10:18.440 --> 03:10:25.080
socialization which is crazy because primary socialization is your parents but secondary is

03:10:25.080 --> 03:10:30.520
like outside outside influence and i could influence you to see the world differently

03:10:30.520 --> 03:10:36.920
through my words which is like insane um even we might not even be in the same generation and it's

03:10:36.920 --> 03:10:42.120

What shenanigans did you get up to whilst I took a big fat Joby?

Okay, I've got food, lads she's been gone for 84 years, I've not, I've not, I've been

03:23:16.920 --> 03:23:17.920
good.

03:23:17.920 --> 03:23:20.360
Like, none of it's true.

03:23:20.360 --> 03:23:24.280
I got cola, I got a tea and I got food, I'm so happy.

03:23:24.280 --> 03:23:25.280
A what now?

03:23:25.280 --> 03:23:34.960
Like, all I'm saying is the kettle was boiled and the microwave had microwaved, okay.

03:23:34.960 --> 03:23:37.640
We talked about the happening.

03:23:37.640 --> 03:23:39.480
She's back, I am back.

03:23:39.480 --> 03:23:45.040
And I have food, a nice tab out and look at marshmallows or is this gonna break the

03:23:45.040 --> 03:23:46.040
game?

03:23:46.040 --> 03:23:50.880
Wouldn't that be hilarious if it broke the game and I had to redo it all over it then?

03:23:50.880 --> 03:23:54.560
Oh my god that would be so funny, please don't do that.

03:23:54.560 --> 03:23:58.560
Where's my mouse?

03:23:58.560 --> 03:23:59.560
Got this?

03:23:59.560 --> 03:24:00.560
Okay, we're back.

03:24:00.560 --> 03:24:02.560
How do I open up marshmallow?

03:24:02.560 --> 03:24:15.400
We're just gonna be stuffing our faces for a couple of minutes so I'll read marshmallow.

03:24:15.400 --> 03:24:21.640
The toes, the toes from the stream the other day hit all the right spots, thank you so

03:24:21.640 --> 03:24:25.640
much for caring to your people's desires.

03:24:25.640 --> 03:24:31.960
I had quite a bit of spicy time, can't wait to see more of those toesies, oh you'll be

03:24:31.960 --> 03:24:44.760
excited for tomorrow's stream, oh my god, oh that's funny as anything.

03:24:44.760 --> 03:24:51.760
I want to him in your curls, my curls, my curled toes?

03:24:51.760 --> 03:24:59.960
Wow, when you tape you keep your hand on the WASD keys, you're a true gamer, typical

03:24:59.960 --> 03:25:03.960
people keep it ASDF, do they have that WASD?

03:25:03.960 --> 03:25:11.120
Oh my god, I can't believe it, I'm a nerd, you've caught me.

03:25:11.120 --> 03:25:15.360
You have the most beautiful tiny hands in the world, yeah some people said my hands

03:25:15.360 --> 03:25:22.840
were small, I'm not, I don't actually, I think my hands are the average size for a

03:25:22.840 --> 03:25:27.520
Whammon, I thought, I don't even think funny, I actually thought I was like bang on average

03:25:27.520 --> 03:25:34.720
for everything, but I guess I'm not and I'm actually on the smaller side, they are tiny,

03:25:34.720 --> 03:25:40.000
oh okay, like when I got the ruler out, oh sorry I just punched the microphone, when

03:25:40.000 --> 03:25:46.880
I got the ruler out I thought that was really fun because everyone can kinda, WASD is natural

03:25:46.880 --> 03:25:57.120
hand position, yeah I definitely agree with that, mm-hmm, God you have no idea how badly

03:25:57.120 --> 03:26:03.560
I want to hold my hand, I should come to a convention then, I'll have, I'll get a body

03:26:03.560 --> 03:26:12.320
guard just to make sure everything's all above ground, but yeah I can bring all damn things,

03:26:12.320 --> 03:26:16.720
I don't know, I feel like if someone comes to a convention to come see you, I like the

03:26:16.720 --> 03:26:21.160
idol meetings, like the Japanese idol meetings where they hold your hand and you can talk

03:26:21.160 --> 03:26:25.360
and look at each other over the table type thing, I think that's really sweet and cute,

03:26:25.440 --> 03:26:32.960
but I don't know, I don't know, it just seems like something, I dunno, it's just me, mm-hmm,

03:26:35.520 --> 03:26:40.640
the ASMR booth if only, I wish a convention would entertain me to do that, that's honestly

03:26:40.640 --> 03:26:51.520
ridiculous, make sure everything's above the table honestly, who would get in trouble first,

03:26:51.520 --> 03:27:00.480
me or you, me or everyone, let me analyze this one,

03:27:01.600 --> 03:27:06.560
hey Strony, is there any chance for a hypnosis with helping the listener with addiction

03:27:07.520 --> 03:27:12.160
or focusing desires upon yourself from distractions, um,

03:27:12.320 --> 03:27:19.680
oh I'm not sure I can do stuff like that, mine is always of an alternative nature

03:27:20.880 --> 03:27:33.760
for grat of the defying nature, I absolutely am not qualified or capable or doing anything that

03:27:34.400 --> 03:27:45.600
kind of has like a, I don't know what the word is, but like I, therapeutic, yeah I would say

03:27:46.320 --> 03:27:53.440
any therapeutic hypnosis I can't participate in because I don't actually have the knowledge

03:27:53.440 --> 03:28:00.080
on who goes there, how to do it safely, so safety first I will admit this is out of my

03:28:00.960 --> 03:28:05.840
league, I am definitely not there and I don't think I ever will be there, um 10 out of 10,

03:28:05.840 --> 03:28:11.040
9 out of 10, holy moly, oh yeah, oh did you forget when I eat I burp even more, that's right,

03:28:11.040 --> 03:28:19.600
the air gets trapped in these lungs, eh lungs in this stomach, I gave you my tribute cherry

03:28:19.600 --> 03:28:26.320
and no one else, you're the only woman to ever, ah

03:28:32.720 --> 03:28:36.000
these are supposed to be special, I have a mindset in the first place, oh I don't

03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:41.200
ever feel like forced to or anything, but I do like that, I took your cherry,

03:28:44.240 --> 03:28:48.240
hi Strony, just finished watching your sweet stream and I have to say those sweets are not

03:28:49.200 --> 03:28:54.640
as sweet as you, those sweets aren't as sweet as you, hey, oh okay we'll give you that one,

03:28:54.640 --> 03:29:00.720
that was cute, okay that was cute, every journal joke I know though, also did you know that the

03:29:00.720 --> 03:29:05.840
bumps on the F and J keys on your keyboard are there so you can correctly place your hands

03:29:05.840 --> 03:29:13.920
fingers on them without looking or touching, I thought the WASD was funny, I didn't know that,

03:29:14.000 --> 03:29:18.960
you have taught me knowledge, everyone please finger the F key and notice the bump on the F

03:29:18.960 --> 03:29:29.360
that is for positioning reasons, and in light of recent events the girls have made it clear

03:29:29.360 --> 03:29:37.040
they don't want our unfaithful scene, even with your permission if they are reciprocal

03:29:37.600 --> 03:29:45.440
and dedication, I am happy for them and happy to oblige their wishes, however this means your

03:29:46.880 --> 03:29:55.840
king will be ignored, my sharing, I'm trying to navigate this in a particular way, I think we

03:29:55.840 --> 03:30:06.960
all know, I'm trying to get around it, I will just have to, I will have to, I can't say anything,

03:30:07.520 --> 03:30:14.240
my tentacle is no once again for your exquisite news, oh I love that and only,

03:30:20.080 --> 03:30:23.840
I can't read anything else over that, there we go finger in the F, yes

03:30:37.520 --> 03:30:50.000
mmm yes, my sea queen, my sea queen yes, they can entertain my sea queen due to the girls

03:30:51.520 --> 03:30:54.160
preference, yes

03:30:59.200 --> 03:31:03.600
oh my god my pc, I don't know if it's because it's on standby but it's making the room

03:31:04.560 --> 03:31:11.120
unbelievably hot, hi cuddles, during this stream this morning you ask what a fumu was

03:31:11.120 --> 03:31:15.120
in response to my comment about some plushies, they're basically smug plushies of popular

03:31:15.120 --> 03:31:21.440
characters from the two whole series, however they have developed a bit of a cult following

03:31:21.440 --> 03:31:25.520
due to memes and such and ended up with people making their own similar plushies like the

03:31:25.520 --> 03:31:30.640
Neurosam and Evil Neurosam, oh okay okay from Makership, ah yeah yeah yes I see, I see thank you,

03:31:32.960 --> 03:31:39.920
am I too big for you, oh that's that's a link, that's a link, we'll investigate that later on,

03:31:41.520 --> 03:31:46.240
hi Strony, thanks for the fun stream today, a lot of the American sweets did not look safe to eat

03:31:46.240 --> 03:31:52.400
well but I'm glad you found a new thing you'd like, yeah Makin' Eggs, orange flavor, I'm all about that,

03:31:53.360 --> 03:31:59.600
I'm all about the Makin' Eggs, I've always had a keen interest in hypno content, I'm very very curious

03:32:01.040 --> 03:32:05.200
to experience what you have to offer and even more intrigued by the idea of permanent info and

03:32:07.120 --> 03:32:11.840
I do have a reverse audio that will be publicly accessible, please don't worry, I've always thought

03:32:11.840 --> 03:32:17.840
that hypnosis would never work on me and I'd like to give it a try, literally you, if it's not for you

03:32:17.840 --> 03:32:23.600
that's more than okay, I do offer like alternative like audios and stuff that aren't that theme but

03:32:23.600 --> 03:32:28.560
if it's not for you please don't ever feel forced to like go along with it if that makes sense,

03:32:28.560 --> 03:32:33.200
like either it's for you, you can give it a try, if you're open minded you'll see,

03:32:38.480 --> 03:32:42.400
will you give us your best sometime, also you're quite, oh my god I'm choking on my lasagna,

03:32:42.400 --> 03:32:47.360
you can hear it slide down my throat, also you're quite literally the cutest cop fish I've ever

03:32:47.360 --> 03:32:53.600
seen, thank you, you make me feel a certain kind of way with that voice of yours, oh yeah yeah,

03:32:53.600 --> 03:32:59.600
like this, top, why do I say top of the morning, is this one not scott's, good morning, good evening,

03:32:59.600 --> 03:33:04.800
good afternoon, right today we're playing Skyrim, that's right, Skyrim belongs to the north,

03:33:05.200 --> 03:33:12.720
oh someone says it, someone says I never thought I'd be too big for my beloved,

03:33:12.720 --> 03:33:19.680
I don't know how to handle this information, pick the other hole, it's really not that,

03:33:19.680 --> 03:33:26.320
it's not that hard, actually I encourage you very much, please don't worry,

03:33:28.560 --> 03:33:31.600
I will, I will teach you the ways in the membership stream,

03:33:35.040 --> 03:33:45.120
I love your content, hope to see more, I'm in the process of making a short story for you,

03:33:45.120 --> 03:33:49.360
but now that I'm halfway done with it, I'm on the verge of scrapping it, no, pure shame, no,

03:33:51.120 --> 03:33:55.280
if you ever, if ever saw the late day, I would need a new identity, it's not even explicit,

03:33:55.280 --> 03:34:00.480
I use very loose words, but yeah maybe I shouldn't have brought it up, oh don't be scared to put your

03:34:00.480 --> 03:34:05.360
creations into the, are you joking me, you know all the scripts that you've heard from the girls

03:34:05.360 --> 03:34:11.680
so far, I wrote that, do you think I was proud of the first thing I ever wrote, no, don't scrap it,

03:34:11.680 --> 03:34:26.320
let me read it, I want to read, I'm eating cauliflower that's coated in flavour,

03:34:30.640 --> 03:34:39.520
hmm, um, I'm so sorry, hi scrawny ass in the stream, but looks like it's in past chat,

03:34:39.520 --> 03:34:46.720
what's the model of your keyboard, uh, uh, Corsair, something, I think it's the,

03:34:48.400 --> 03:34:55.280
it's the Australian version because the number two is the at key, which is actually the wrong key

03:34:55.920 --> 03:34:56.720
in the UK,

03:35:02.960 --> 03:35:07.760
this is delicious, this is exactly what I need to stream for 12 hours,

03:35:13.760 --> 03:35:16.320
hey scrawny, just want to say I'm glad that Vealer is up and running,

03:35:17.520 --> 03:35:22.800
um, I've been following since another life and really enjoyed her refresh and your content is,

03:35:22.880 --> 03:35:29.520

03:35:29.520 --> 03:35:34.720
V-trip and, flash-trip and re-re-e together, I feel like what you're doing is really breaking

03:35:34.720 --> 03:35:40.800
out in your character, oh shucks, you stop that, you're, you're, you're blowing,

03:35:49.520 --> 03:35:55.520
years to come, you stop that, I hope they all continue to achieve their dreams, I do too,

03:35:55.520 --> 03:36:03.360
my next goal, once everyone, who goes there, once everyone is monetized, um, we will get,

03:36:04.720 --> 03:36:11.200
um, my next goal is to get them all to 5k subscribers because we have a celebratory artwork

03:36:11.200 --> 03:36:19.440
for that when everyone achieves it, so I'm very excited, oh, it has to be there forever,

03:37:50.560 --> 03:38:03.760
hey, strongy, I'm a skit, so refling, oh, bless your heart, are you okay, son,

03:38:03.760 --> 03:38:10.000
is there any way to retract my mod application, oh, if you get picked for a mod, don't worry,

03:38:10.000 --> 03:38:16.400
you can just reject it at any point, if you get that offer, oh, bless, yeah, I hope you're okay,

03:38:16.400 --> 03:38:21.280
but I don't trust myself with that kind of power, that's really good on you to, uh, be able to see

03:38:21.280 --> 03:38:27.600
that maybe it's not the best idea for you, good on you, skit, so refling, god, the way, it's just,

03:38:27.600 --> 03:38:34.560
it's how direct you identified yourself that was kind of humorous, sorry, I do apologize,

03:38:34.560 --> 03:38:38.880
I'm not laughing at you, I actually just found it, just like, hey, I'm skit, so refling, like, you just,

03:38:38.880 --> 03:38:43.520
you just, like, slammed your boars on the desk because of the, just like, yeah, let's get straight

03:38:43.520 --> 03:38:49.120
to the point, um, so sorry, that was rather humorous the way you wrote that, yes, please just reject

03:38:49.120 --> 03:38:57.040
the offer, if you do get messaged about it, I actually have no idea, uh, mommy, please, I wanna,

03:38:57.040 --> 03:39:07.840
hmm, while listening to you, hmm, hi, Strani, I just wanna say thank you, thank you so much,

03:39:07.840 --> 03:39:11.680
Reeler, I'm really, really happy you're back, but I'm also happy for the other girls too, I am too,

03:39:11.680 --> 03:39:17.040
they're also sweet and talented, oh, I know they are, absolutely adore them,

03:39:19.680 --> 03:39:26.080
I can't read that one out loud because that's very, that's very, uh, maybe in a membership

03:39:26.080 --> 03:39:33.840
room, I tried suggesting another man to make you his new Oshi because he was an old-school

03:39:34.000 --> 03:39:41.840
runescape addict, when he's out of the picture, I'll swoop in on his wife, not that I'm trying,

03:39:41.840 --> 03:39:48.880
well, what, what are you saying, you're trying to get, what, you're trying to get me an old-school

03:39:48.880 --> 03:39:53.440
runescape sugar daddy, I've, none of you have seen the runescape series so far, there's just one

03:39:53.440 --> 03:40:04.160
installment, oh, shit, management just showed up, everyone front and center, I, I, I'm serious,

03:40:04.160 --> 03:40:07.840
you can also contact the website and mention the email you used in the mod application to get it

03:40:07.840 --> 03:40:15.120
removed, okay, yeah, that seems fair, um, uh, what was I saying, oh yeah, I literally have like 22

03:40:15.360 --> 03:40:18.400
million gp and all I did was show up in freaking fish,

03:40:24.160 --> 03:40:27.760
hi cuddles, I'm currently watching the mod of today's ace marstream since I missed it while

03:40:27.760 --> 03:40:35.520
sleeping, I'm someone who has never been able to go under despite having a, having a flavor for it,

03:40:35.920 --> 03:40:40.160
so, one issue I have that I become,

03:40:42.720 --> 03:40:48.960
hysterical, I can't read that, um, uh,

03:40:53.520 --> 03:40:55.760
uh-huh, okay,

03:40:59.120 --> 03:41:03.360
okay, we have quite an effect on this replay, that's adorable, I like that,

03:41:04.240 --> 03:41:06.560
I'm managing with quick hands above desk honestly,

03:41:08.320 --> 03:41:15.920
hi, I love you mom, I love you to everything, the stream was incredible, I'm really glad that

03:41:15.920 --> 03:41:19.600
I interest you and I can't wait to see what you do next, also I'm still here and she'd be streamed

03:41:19.600 --> 03:41:26.160
for you, I'm devoted to you, I really want to send you something, but I haven't had the inspiration

03:41:26.160 --> 03:41:32.800
been really in my, my emotions lately and it's really slammed my libido, do I know a sad fact,

03:41:32.800 --> 03:41:40.720
my alternative picture is the last time, rip in the chat, I've been so freaking stressed like

03:41:40.720 --> 03:41:49.120
all the time and I can't like unstress myself, I think it'll calm down like once the thing

03:41:49.840 --> 03:41:52.640
but like I'm so freaking stressed and it's such a shame,

03:42:00.160 --> 03:42:07.040
but I'm sure I will get inspiration soon, I think maybe, I'll tell you what, I think maybe once

03:42:07.040 --> 03:42:13.280
the monetization for everyone has been achieved, I'll start to feel relaxed because like then truly

03:42:13.280 --> 03:42:16.960
is up to the girls, whatever they want to do and I can just get fun shorts ordered of them,

03:42:17.760 --> 03:42:23.120
but like right now I'm like, oh my god there's four out of six, why is the other two not come

03:42:23.120 --> 03:42:26.960
through because we applied for them all at the same time, like oh no weapons of one of the girls

03:42:26.960 --> 03:42:32.000
don't get YouTube monetization, oh no that's like a whole month and uh just like oh I don't,

03:42:32.000 --> 03:42:36.400
oh I would be sick if I think about it, we pretend we do not see,

03:42:36.720 --> 03:42:48.640
but yeah, the, what did I just say, there's a line of volunteers is extremely long, thank,

03:42:49.680 --> 03:42:51.520
yeah you guys want to make gentry right now?

03:42:58.400 --> 03:43:03.600
I've almost finished eating and then I will slurp my honey tea and then we'll get back into

03:43:03.600 --> 03:43:22.000
the thieves guild, Skyrim's going good, we're at um Gollum from the thieves guild quest,

03:43:22.880 --> 03:43:29.520
we're about to be meeting the big naughty on who's trying to take down the thieves guild

03:43:29.520 --> 03:43:38.480
soon to him and then once we do the thieves guild we are going to do the dark brotherhood

03:43:38.480 --> 03:43:42.960
because I actually really enjoy it, it's quite, I think the dark brotherhood is actually relatively

03:43:42.960 --> 03:43:50.560
quick um and then we're going to do the vampires and then if we still have time we're going to do

03:43:51.360 --> 03:43:57.840
um the actual dragonborn quest line which I hate doing because it breaks the game

03:43:58.400 --> 03:44:02.720
and if you ever like seriously want to do like a hundred percent speed run,

03:44:02.720 --> 03:44:06.560
eh speed run, not speed run, just a hundred percent achievements, always leave it last

03:44:06.560 --> 03:44:13.680
because it breaks the game so much when you have to like say like oh we'll give white run up or we'll

03:44:13.680 --> 03:44:19.840
give this uh rifting up or we'll do this or we'll do that, every detail of how much it breaks the

03:44:19.840 --> 03:44:32.400
game, but I finished my my bowl of lasagna, um now I've got my cup of tea and my cola, I do, I do,

03:44:32.400 --> 03:44:38.240
I've got my cola, no need to read this during a stream, oh yeah what happens if I do it right now

03:44:39.200 --> 03:44:46.960
the ASMR stream was amazing strongy, I was putting your hands during it, ah that's so cute

03:44:47.760 --> 03:44:49.760
hmm

03:44:52.640 --> 03:44:59.440
I'm giving you, oh whoa someone is giving me a step by step

03:45:01.200 --> 03:45:05.440
gate on how to do haptic feedback

03:45:05.440 --> 03:45:16.000
inalize, inalizing, okay that's the law links, um how down bad do you think is too down bad for

03:45:16.000 --> 03:45:19.440
you, for me, oh no I like, I like main corruption

03:45:22.240 --> 03:45:31.040
so there's not really a down too bad, I think corruption's really um up there um oh my first

03:45:31.040 --> 03:45:35.920
membership stream can be about that, no about ranking everything

03:45:41.920 --> 03:45:52.480
inalize, yes, oh strongy, I just want to thank you for giving all the girls a home and a family,

03:45:52.480 --> 03:45:56.960
Vila are such a positive part of the environment already and I'm happy to watch along with all

03:45:57.040 --> 03:46:02.880
the other reflins, oh reflin, I said also the latest patreon post is incredible,

03:46:03.760 --> 03:46:09.040
did you like it, I thought it was good, would you let me pick on your party

03:46:11.680 --> 03:46:18.080
yes if you are a patreon member um another audio has gone up so there's a total of three audios

03:46:18.080 --> 03:46:24.720
up, um it is spaced out for the other girls so because all the audios were uploaded on the first

03:46:24.800 --> 03:46:29.760
that did mean there's a bit of a break between the next one that comes up but as it stands

03:46:29.760 --> 03:46:42.320
everyone has a day, if I can remember correctly Azura, Monday, Mercy, Tuesday, um Emmy, Weddin's Day,

03:46:42.320 --> 03:46:56.400
Shebe, Thursday, AC, Friday, strongy, Saturday, I'm not quite sure but just so you understand

03:46:56.400 --> 03:47:08.080
they are purposefully spaced out who goes there and um they will be like every Tuesday

03:47:08.080 --> 03:47:14.480
all of X's will go out on every Tuesday all of like for me every Saturday an audio will come out

03:47:14.480 --> 03:47:22.160
like that kind of thing um we I'm going to get the girls to post on what's inside like with the

03:47:22.160 --> 03:47:29.840
tags and everything I just need catch up time um she says as she's sitting on Skyrim for an

03:47:29.840 --> 03:47:35.040
endurance stream I've got nothing but the cheek I really do I've got nothing but the cheek but

03:47:35.040 --> 03:47:44.000
I do need catch up time to get into the floor things then next month um 100% will be like you

03:47:44.000 --> 03:47:49.920
will see what's inside if you want to subscribe for that month or not and if not then you know you

03:47:49.920 --> 03:47:55.280
can take a look at whoever else is posting maybe they've got something a bit more up to your style

03:47:55.280 --> 03:48:00.080
again I would like to repeat when it comes to the audios I have not shoehorned anyone into the

03:48:00.080 --> 03:48:08.160
same type of plot if you will because that will not financially enable them to be the

03:48:08.160 --> 03:48:13.440
content creator they'd like to be um a lot of the girls are looking at moving out possibly if

03:48:13.440 --> 03:48:18.000
they're able to receive enough support so that's why I do say if you only have enough money to

03:48:18.000 --> 03:48:26.640
support one girl please do pick a daughter of mine because um they are gunning to move out um

03:48:27.360 --> 03:48:35.520
and it means they would provide more content and yeah it's just a very positive cycle occurs um

03:48:36.880 --> 03:48:44.960
yes uh yeah I'm both meanies like not bad just to kill it by emoji if you subscribe to everyone

03:48:44.960 --> 03:48:51.040
you get an audio every day I mean technically you're very close you get a rest day no one uploads

03:48:51.040 --> 03:48:59.120
on a sunday also they deserve it yes the girls work incredibly hard um AC was like am I allowed

03:48:59.120 --> 03:49:04.240
someone asked a question to AC on marshmallow like uh how do your recordings work and she was like

03:49:04.240 --> 03:49:09.360
am I allowed to talk about this and I'm like yeah you can as long as you don't see anything that's

03:49:09.360 --> 03:49:15.600
like NDA obvious then yeah you can talk about how I I burst into your DMs and hand you a script and

03:49:15.600 --> 03:49:20.960
all the spelling is wrong and the grammar's whack yeah you can talk about that all you like I say

03:49:23.920 --> 03:49:32.960
actual day of rest honestly um but yes thank you for thanking me for giving the girls a home

03:49:32.960 --> 03:49:40.000
but please understand the girls did it themselves they reached out to vealer they applied um they

03:49:40.000 --> 03:49:43.920
went to an interview and they were happy with everything some of them did the very thorough

03:49:43.920 --> 03:49:51.120
research uh Emmy actually was the most inquisitive and had the most questions Azura I think she was

03:49:51.120 --> 03:49:56.160
just like is any of this real I think she thought she was dreaming because she never asked a single

03:49:56.160 --> 03:50:04.160
question after the interview um yeah Azura was absolutely adorable Emmy asked a ton of questions

03:50:04.160 --> 03:50:08.720
which made me think she wasn't actually gonna accept the character because I told her what the

03:50:08.720 --> 03:50:16.480
character's theme was and I saw people were being weird but yeah Azura was like fuck it we ball

03:50:16.480 --> 03:50:23.520
NDA and the dogs did not withstand and they have carte blanche what carte blanche

03:50:24.240 --> 03:50:33.760
but what uh in English what in English English that's so Azura honestly yeah this one's like

03:50:34.720 --> 03:50:45.440
big mommy we ball honestly a free pass or it means like free reign oh carte blanche a blank menu

03:50:46.080 --> 03:50:53.200
is what the translation is that makes sense a free pass a blank menu oh my god I can't believe it

03:50:53.200 --> 03:50:58.080
sorry I translated it literally versus uh metaphor good uh

03:50:58.560 --> 03:51:05.120
hi sending messages scares me but I want I watched your ASMR stream and it was amazing

03:51:05.120 --> 03:51:09.520
I can't wait to see more of your stuff both ASMR and other videos they're so fantastic I'm watching you

03:51:10.560 --> 03:51:16.800
do what you love and making ASMR making via lure has me thinking I should start and follow my

03:51:16.800 --> 03:51:21.680
you should follow your own dreams you've only got one shot I keep snail blinking please Paul

03:51:21.680 --> 03:51:25.760
please don't notice me snail blinking you do you've only got one shot if you've got a dream

03:51:25.760 --> 03:51:31.040
or something you want to achieve where can go for it like if I win the lottery already know what I'm

03:51:31.040 --> 03:51:37.600
doing all I'm saying is if I win the lottery the girls are getting stacked out so I'm saying um

03:51:38.560 --> 03:51:44.400
you know the split going even higher you know oh it's always fun to try and reach for a new goal

03:51:44.400 --> 03:51:49.280
like for example hypnosis is my new goal I've always enjoyed it and always liked it but I've

03:51:49.280 --> 03:51:53.920
never made it myself because like I'm just like not skilled and I need to make sure it's safe

03:51:53.920 --> 03:51:59.200
and all that sorry I'm trying to wait there's a fucking cat hair on my face and it's one of

03:51:59.200 --> 03:52:04.160
those cat hairs where you wipe it away and then it does a 360 look back on wherever it's freaking

03:52:04.160 --> 03:52:14.480
a caption I'm so sorry that'll be gimley honestly um but you honestly you placed everyone in their

03:52:14.480 --> 03:52:20.960
spots so well I wouldn't picture anyone else yes there is right no I'm not gonna say it because

03:52:21.040 --> 03:52:26.880
I might start up some shitters um and we ain't stirring the pot from these parts we tap the

03:52:26.880 --> 03:52:36.640
sign from these parts um let's see hi strongy could you give us a hearing test like hearing

03:52:36.640 --> 03:52:46.080
test ASMR of course I can do something like that for ya you do a 360 and walk away wait a minute

03:52:46.160 --> 03:52:54.880
a 180 oops wait no 360 is the circle 180 is the opposite right okay um I could absolutely

03:52:54.880 --> 03:53:02.320
do a hearing test I did a ear cleaning where I'm like muffled until as the audio progresses I'm less

03:53:02.320 --> 03:53:06.480
muffled I thought it was pretty cool I need to edit it actually it might be one of my one and four

03:53:06.480 --> 03:53:12.320
because I owe you four this whole Skyrim stream actually kind of went perfect because tomorrow

03:53:12.320 --> 03:53:19.200
I will do my monetization celebration stream where everyone can absolutely laugh in I'm pretty

03:53:19.200 --> 03:53:24.080
sure someone's probably already guessed what I've got planned for it there's no way after yesterday's

03:53:24.080 --> 03:53:28.640
stream someone hasn't put two and two together and knows why I got a pedicure in particular

03:53:29.520 --> 03:53:36.880
I refuse I refuse she fell for the oldest these eggs box joke honestly do a 540 believe it

03:53:37.840 --> 03:53:44.000
um my body prevented me from my dreams so I come about have you ever had an actual medical

03:53:44.000 --> 03:53:51.120
ear cleaning I've not had a medical ear cleaning but I did get my hearing checked as a child um

03:53:51.120 --> 03:53:57.680
because I was ignoring my mum where I was undiagnosed it was my idea actually um

03:54:00.320 --> 03:54:02.720
I'm going to sip my tea before it gets too cold okay

03:54:03.680 --> 03:54:12.080
eh yeah my mum got me uh sent her a hearing test because she was sitting on my dash she was like

03:54:12.080 --> 03:54:17.520
scrawny doesn't he listen to me like scrawny scrawny never hears me and I used to do this thing

03:54:17.520 --> 03:54:23.680
where I sat right in front of the tv so the tv was on a stand but I would sit directly under it so

03:54:23.680 --> 03:54:28.720
my neck was looking directly upward sorry I just hit the mic there by yeah I know you can't see my

03:54:28.720 --> 03:54:35.440
hands but my mic was at my mic my neck was directly upwards looking at the tv like pure pure in a

03:54:35.440 --> 03:54:43.440
trance like straight up like Tism a doctor walked in and Tism was the diagnosis type thing and obviously

03:54:43.440 --> 03:54:49.040
my mum didn't know what it was all about at the time so I got sent for a hearing test and she was

03:54:49.040 --> 03:54:55.760
like the wife that did the hearing test on me she was like oh no pet you're here in Spain I don't know

03:54:55.760 --> 03:55:03.040
what's going on with you um and yeah basically that was that's when the signs start to show

03:55:03.040 --> 03:55:08.880
and then now here I am someone who has to read and write for a living and goodness gravy is it

03:55:08.880 --> 03:55:15.600
freaking hard I'm slurping is she okay nah she's just fucking hell autistic

03:55:18.640 --> 03:55:25.360
a kid with autism how close were you to the tv oh I'm not being funny when I'm like I was

03:55:25.360 --> 03:55:33.520
directly below the tv I like I was sitting crisscross looking directly up at the tv and my

03:55:33.520 --> 03:55:43.600
neck was up in the air like and I and my mum ascertained that it was hearing issues rather than

03:55:43.600 --> 03:55:49.280
something else what might be going on she had a case of strong autism honestly the strong

03:55:49.760 --> 03:55:50.320
too strong

03:55:53.360 --> 03:55:58.640
and that's not good for your eyes oh well I do actually need to be wearing my glicks but

03:56:00.400 --> 03:56:06.000
I'm making it work okay I was right in the vtuber collab scripts and I was like this is too small

03:56:06.000 --> 03:56:11.200
this takes so I zoomed in and I'm like oh my god I'm gonna be a blind as a fish like really soon

03:56:11.200 --> 03:56:13.840
wait that's literally me as a kid literally

03:56:13.840 --> 03:56:26.320
do you reckon cuttlefish have actual autism um as an uncertified marine biologist anything

03:56:26.320 --> 03:56:31.600
is possible if you didn't know down syndrome is possible in animals as well um I believe

03:56:31.600 --> 03:56:42.240
down syndrome is the deletion of chrome zone oh god was it in humans uh not 32 that's not right

03:56:42.240 --> 03:56:46.160
I can't remember which deletion it is but it can happen in gorillas seriously I'm not even

03:56:46.160 --> 03:56:51.280
kidding look up down soon down syndrome gorilla and like it's fucking creepy oh it's an extra

03:56:51.280 --> 03:56:57.840
addition of 21 sorry yeah I'm thinking of the deletion one what is the deletion one called

03:56:58.800 --> 03:57:06.960
that I always watch documentaries about it happens when life deletes 32 yes um actually

03:57:07.040 --> 03:57:15.520
spindle fiber failure um uh which is I um I find it really interesting oh god yeah I feel like

03:57:15.520 --> 03:57:20.960
every time I'm like I find this so interesting and fascinating it leads to me rambling about

03:57:20.960 --> 03:57:26.240
something that you guys couldn't give less of a shit about I feel really bad but at the same

03:57:26.240 --> 03:57:31.520
time I really like blabbing away so I'm like that just do it that just tell you about um

03:57:31.520 --> 03:57:38.240
fertilization so the reason why the rate of down syndrome goes up dramatically the older

03:57:38.240 --> 03:57:46.880
the woman is beyond the age of 25 yes the age of 25 um you're you're already hitting the wall at 25 rip

03:57:46.880 --> 03:57:54.000
um the reason it goes up exponentially is because the failure of the spindle fibers that's what pulls

03:57:54.000 --> 03:58:03.440
apart um that's what pulls it apart and then results in a the an additional chromosome wiggling

03:58:03.440 --> 03:58:10.880
about which is the rise of down syndrome which is why women who um are having children later in life

03:58:10.880 --> 03:58:20.160
are often advised to do what is referred to as a DNA test which I've completely forgotten the name of

03:58:20.160 --> 03:58:26.000
but basically they pierce the amniotic sac and take a tiny cell sample of the baby and then check

03:58:26.000 --> 03:58:31.600
its DNA sequence under um you know get it because to see if the child has done syndrome or not and

03:58:31.600 --> 03:58:35.440
then either they're advised would you like to terminate or not or bring to term whatever

03:58:36.000 --> 03:58:42.240
type thing goes on but um it definitely is a risk and uh like also being obese with the child as well

03:58:42.240 --> 03:58:47.200
results in gestational diabetes which is very dangerous for the child very dangerous for the mom

03:58:47.920 --> 03:58:56.560
um there's also um if depending on the blood type of the mother and the blood type of the child

03:58:56.560 --> 03:59:04.800
the mother during the entire pregnancy her body can be attacking the baby until it has a natural

03:59:05.440 --> 03:59:11.680
abortion if you didn't know abortion is the natural term but you can also get a medical abortion

03:59:12.240 --> 03:59:15.440
but abortion is the natural term for it just happening

03:59:16.400 --> 03:59:21.040
there are many reasons why it can never come to term how do you know all this stuff is fascinating

03:59:21.040 --> 03:59:27.840
no I don't go to school I like watching youtube videos about um biology related things I have a

03:59:27.840 --> 03:59:37.680
fascination in uh diagnoses in particular like why the reason it occurs for example um like uh

03:59:37.680 --> 03:59:44.560
there's this syndrome uh of course it evades my mind I think it's called like William Hunter's

03:59:44.560 --> 03:59:51.200
syndrome where the child or the well the child that can become an adult um because you you do not pass

03:59:51.200 --> 03:59:56.640
away uh unless you have complications with other diseases for example um you will never experience

03:59:56.640 --> 04:00:03.360
the sensation of being full uh you will constantly eat um there's like hereditary syndromes as well

04:00:03.440 --> 04:00:11.840
like hunter syndrome which is pretty uh devastating and um there's interesting one such as dwarfism

04:00:11.840 --> 04:00:19.360
dwarfism can actually be passed on by two individuals who visually do not have any um display of any

04:00:19.360 --> 04:00:28.960
dwarf uh ism genetics um but it is a recessive gene and if the two people come together um yep

04:00:28.960 --> 04:00:31.680
we can have it how do you know all this riefling that obviously has not got the

04:00:32.880 --> 04:00:43.840
angel man syndrome is that angel man syndrome is that the one where the child is locked in the

04:00:43.840 --> 04:00:53.520
child like stay I believe so mentally they can't develop any further um uh yes uh Harley Quinn

04:00:53.520 --> 04:00:58.240
syndrome um doesn't sound like what it is it's where your skin constantly your skin regenerates

04:00:58.240 --> 04:01:04.640
so fast that you flake and you break and it's just absolute it is a living heck for those poor

04:01:05.520 --> 04:01:12.880
like children that are born but you can make it to adulthood um there's a lot of sad um

04:01:12.880 --> 04:01:18.560
diagnoses that you can get like you can get childhood dementia those are quite crushing ones um

04:01:20.480 --> 04:01:26.160
stroneys institute for the gift to take that angel man is the eaten one is it Harley Quinn

04:01:26.160 --> 04:01:34.560
it she was this year is dwarf ism classified only as being short there are a redonkulous

04:01:34.560 --> 04:01:42.560
amount of dwarfism classifications um some can be like no stunted growth on the abdomen uh other

04:01:42.560 --> 04:01:50.880
versions are no stunted growth on the arms and the legs but the um organ holder area if you will

04:01:50.880 --> 04:01:56.000
for lack of better words abdomen all the interest in that like there's so many different classifications

04:01:56.000 --> 04:02:02.960
is quite um it's quite fascinating stuff when she uh get into torso yeah torso will do just

04:02:02.960 --> 04:02:08.160
nicely uh I remember when the photos of those babies were used as shock for yeah unfortunately um

04:02:10.160 --> 04:02:17.120
kind of if you use older like if you look up like Freud's stuff for example you get quite a few

04:02:17.120 --> 04:02:23.440
older photos that are like Freud Freud you didn't have to photograph that mate like you know do you

04:02:23.440 --> 04:02:29.040
know about prisons yeah like the stanley prison experiment and how people play roles that they

04:02:29.040 --> 04:02:37.040
perceive to be superior uh absolutely fascinating stuff I do enjoy the psychology I has to offer um

04:02:38.320 --> 04:02:48.960
I think humans and our everyday socialization were always kind of it's always insinuated that

04:02:48.960 --> 04:02:57.200
there's someone to look up to but I am a big believer in the three um three perspective

04:02:57.200 --> 04:03:02.400
talk and it's like parent to parent child to child adult to parent or something like that

04:03:02.960 --> 04:03:09.200
and it's like the three ways you can communicate with someone he said prions oh not prisons my

04:03:09.200 --> 04:03:16.640
apology I was talking about the the stanley prison experiment prions uh no a little bit

04:03:16.640 --> 04:03:22.240
about prions not not not too much sorry I just read what I wanted to read prudder's william's

04:03:22.240 --> 04:03:27.920
syndrome oh prudder willie syndrome that sounds like um I was mixing them up yes prions diseases

04:03:27.920 --> 04:03:35.600
are horrifying um did you know about the family of blue people from generations of I know there's

04:03:35.600 --> 04:03:43.120
a family that's like on youtube because someone goes and films them and they um communicate via

04:03:43.120 --> 04:03:47.280
barks because they have so many issues it's such a shame

04:03:50.640 --> 04:03:54.480
I want this woman to yank me for the rest of my life honestly

04:03:56.560 --> 04:04:03.120
uh well that speaking of prions um what is it rabid racoon bites you what's that called

04:04:04.080 --> 04:04:13.520
as soon as you develop um water phobia water phobia hydrophobia water phobia once you develop

04:04:13.520 --> 04:04:18.400
hydrophobia rabies that's it once you develop hydrophobia you have a hundred percent um

04:04:20.000 --> 04:04:27.360
loss rate uh you can't win it is it is some scary stuff and and to think that we are very

04:04:27.440 --> 04:04:33.520
lucky to avoid this by getting a simple tetanus shot um it turns out in test was not wincent

04:04:33.520 --> 04:04:39.040
are you squidding me right now I'm not I'm sorry for the interruption no no barnside note

04:04:39.040 --> 04:04:48.880
strani teacher outfit when I mean I'm down like I'm I'm down to clone you want strani teach

04:04:48.880 --> 04:04:53.680

hmm I've uh a bit of a I have some leaks so close your ears if you don't want to hear about

04:05:09.360 --> 04:05:16.800
the audio leaks uh uh referring to my gen mates um so the new audio uh I don't know master manager

04:05:16.800 --> 04:05:23.440
wherever the frick you want to call them um is now in place uh there is like a I told you that

what is being put down uh Emmys uh is coming through um I actually need to send off a note

04:06:02.800 --> 04:06:08.000
because I accidentally wrote Emmys part one uh to our four part series which is a big mistake

04:06:08.000 --> 04:06:11.760

the don't if you're like I do not have the money to support these girls do not worry you can do it

04:07:21.520 --> 04:07:27.040
for free by liking their streams and hanging out even if you're lurking it's perfectly fine

04:07:27.600 --> 04:07:31.760
um and then you might be saying to yourself but if I don't give money I don't get access to certain

04:07:31.760 --> 04:07:38.800
content while this is true wait until the don't know thorns I have purposely made the effort

04:07:38.800 --> 04:07:46.320
for goals to be public access um now please don't get me wrong there still be rewards for those who

04:07:46.320 --> 04:07:55.680
can but I have purposely pushed for public access rewards once goals have been met please let me

04:07:56.240 --> 04:08:01.760
try and cook it's very hard to find a good balance who goes there I don't find yourself um

04:08:02.960 --> 04:08:10.400
but yes I am I am trying my best to find the perfect thing we've already undercut at the

04:08:10.400 --> 04:08:20.000
market severely price point wise on patreon um and we hope that through showing the lack of greed

04:08:20.720 --> 04:08:27.760
the lack of greed uh that you know don't worry like even if you can't pay we're we've got you

where where are we the Tower of Babel is the old story about man about a man's hubris and

04:09:09.680 --> 04:09:14.320
defiance of god and the reason they allegedly that man speak isn't that Tower of Babel on

04:09:14.960 --> 04:09:21.760

accessibility no greed and moe miscompany I gotta go on a jogs and enjoy your jog I'd say

04:09:30.320 --> 04:09:39.040
listen to the stream but you might be bricked up by the time you're uh it's the Tower of Babel

04:09:39.760 --> 04:09:42.000
okay wait is Babylon just a location then

04:09:47.040 --> 04:09:56.880
Azura what are you doing in my game Azura what's going on Azura are you going to the high ground

04:09:57.760 --> 04:10:01.920
what are you doing what are you going to do once you're up here huh what are you going to do once

you're up here nothing oh you're still going oh my god she's still going Azura where where are you

04:10:09.600 --> 04:10:18.160
supposed to go Azura is absolutely lagging I'm not I'm no lying she's absolutely lagging it

04:10:19.280 --> 04:10:21.760
oh I heard that that plot

04:10:24.400 --> 04:10:29.680
Babylon is the whole horror Babylon thing uh I've been playing too much I

04:10:32.880 --> 04:10:38.720
oh my gosh right that's it oh I like that

04:10:42.480 --> 04:10:48.480
okay she can beat him up it's fine I like that he's just dodging and then I just do one big

04:10:48.480 --> 04:10:55.760
oh that's a steal oh no wait a minute that's against the law I'm a good fantasy role player

04:10:56.320 --> 04:11:04.240
I broke her stance you know what else I'll break her hi man okay you're done where is it

04:11:04.240 --> 04:11:10.400
where's the enemy oh he's uh oh I never even saw that man I really do need my glasses on that's

04:11:10.400 --> 04:11:17.440
terrible legit I thought you were talking about Skyrim's Azura Azura isn't even in the other Skyrim

04:11:18.000 --> 04:11:21.040
didn't have Azura maybe Azura's star

04:11:22.960 --> 04:11:24.080
the kind of thing which is

04:11:30.800 --> 04:11:31.600
wait is this not it

04:11:33.840 --> 04:11:38.720
hey wait what how come crazy is this not it

04:11:38.720 --> 04:11:54.560
oh my god I've gone way too far ahead of the plot I've gone way too far ahead of the plot

04:11:54.560 --> 04:12:01.120
I've not even spoken to the guy to get him to move I was so confused why the trap door wasn't open up

04:12:01.840 --> 04:12:07.520
oh Azura gets you to clean out her star right you're done I'm not not you're done

04:12:08.560 --> 04:12:13.520
didn't even get to the the first message I read in chat after like a couple of minutes of combat

04:12:13.520 --> 04:12:22.880
that's terrible yeah Azura's star is I thought it was on I'm literally speed run the plot I've

04:12:22.880 --> 04:12:30.080
gone like 10 leagues ahead I do apologize Babel is where humanity teamed up to build a tower

04:12:31.200 --> 04:12:41.040
to heaven and knocked it down and honestly it's quite interesting how

04:12:43.280 --> 04:12:48.400
no I can't say that unfortunately um base I'm speed running the plot

04:12:48.960 --> 04:12:57.360
uh yeah I've been playing too much Binding of Isaac oh my god wait have I said I'm I'm like

04:12:57.360 --> 04:13:03.280
nine-name percent sure I've actually already said this but some of the girls are into tarot cards

04:13:03.280 --> 04:13:10.560
they're called um and it's the funniest thing ever and the reason why it's funny is my only

04:13:10.560 --> 04:13:16.560
exposure to tarot cards is the Binding of Isaac okay which means whenever they're talking about

04:13:17.040 --> 04:13:23.200
pooling cards or whatever they're like the tower card and I'm like yes yes six bombs six bombs you

04:13:23.200 --> 04:13:29.040
can probably unlock like a secret um like a tinted rock and get like a soul heart from it yes and

04:13:29.040 --> 04:13:33.760
like the lovers yes you can get two hearts if you can find a donation machine maybe you can get some

04:13:33.760 --> 04:13:39.440
coins out of it I'm like oh goodness sake like all of them must be rolling their eyes that my only

04:13:39.440 --> 04:13:48.000
experience like the friggin the hanged man uh oh yeah um that's fantastic I can uh I can fly in the

04:13:48.000 --> 04:13:54.960
room like or the full card oh yeah it takes me back to the starting of the the map oh that's amazing

04:13:54.960 --> 04:14:00.080
that's amazing uh hey I'm just gonna skip this part because I don't really need to see it um

04:14:02.480 --> 04:14:06.880
can you speak a little bit about your plans for membership no bother you shoot before

04:14:06.880 --> 04:14:12.720
but you're honestly worth it oh my god stop you're gonna make me blush um I will most likely do two

04:14:12.720 --> 04:14:20.480
memberships uh streams a week um most likely ASMR membership is probably the most requested I also

04:14:20.480 --> 04:14:29.280
like doing watch alongs um some stream snap games maybe for more closed things um

04:14:37.440 --> 04:14:42.640
well oh if you can speak okay it looks like only bribery works on him um

04:14:44.000 --> 04:14:50.080
two I mean yeah I want to make it worth your money like the way I try to think of it in my head

04:14:50.080 --> 04:14:57.680
is how much do you pay for like a movie ticket for like one and a half hours entertainment

04:14:57.680 --> 04:15:04.080
okay I'ma take that and then double it and then double it again so I'm like okay I'll try to stream

04:15:04.160 --> 04:15:10.800
every single day I'll also try to offer membership streams at least twice a week that seems fair

04:15:10.800 --> 04:15:15.920
that means in total for the membership not only do you directly support me and future projects

04:15:15.920 --> 04:15:22.160
gentle and the projects the girls want to pursue soon but we can't talk about any of it yet um

04:15:24.240 --> 04:15:32.000
and it means like also get like a more I suppose like a more intimate stream experience of people

04:15:32.000 --> 04:15:39.040
like that um like 17 dollars for a movie ticket that's outrageous um

04:15:40.480 --> 04:15:45.600
gen two confirmed live on the stream stocks I remember the first time I did this quest I was

04:15:45.600 --> 04:15:50.800
so nervous about like all the guards coming at me but they don't even care hanged man

04:15:51.360 --> 04:15:58.080
to we we can go well you do watch together streams for members I absolutely would love to do that

04:15:58.080 --> 04:16:04.320
yes we can a hundred percent do that gen two spoiled live no clickbait oh you just wait until

04:16:04.320 --> 04:16:12.800
there's don't a thumb for that if you want to see one of the concepts but not all

04:16:15.600 --> 04:16:20.640
I don't really talk about it in the server with the girls out of respect because of a

04:16:21.520 --> 04:16:26.640
a miscommunication on my part and honestly it's kind of easier it's much easier to go

04:16:27.440 --> 04:16:32.160
you know oh shit my bad you're right then to like explain in mass detail like what the most

04:16:32.160 --> 04:16:39.200
communication was you know like it is what it is gen two is just she be with a different voice

04:16:39.200 --> 04:16:47.920
in a real color mm-hmm I'm actually getting her take this a charcoal skin at some point

04:16:47.920 --> 04:16:52.960
I'm probably do it within the next one I brought in the coin and what not at all we're just skipping

04:16:53.040 --> 04:17:00.160
through the dialogue that can I be our skin into this look now since our transaction I love

04:17:00.160 --> 04:17:09.200
the gen two memes but gen one 3d though mm-hmm the girls are all very interested in 3d the problem is

04:17:09.200 --> 04:17:20.000
I don't know I don't have a heart no sure what can I do for you no

04:17:23.920 --> 04:17:29.600
you should think about staying the night oh wait I know one of those songs but she

04:17:29.600 --> 04:17:35.120
doesn't sing it it's Roderick Roderick there's nothing like a good song to lift the spirit sure

04:17:35.680 --> 04:17:43.360
what can I do for you no there once was a hero named ragnar the rest who came riding to white

04:17:43.360 --> 04:17:53.760
run from old Roderick then all this ragged and ragged and brandish his blade as he told the

04:17:53.760 --> 04:18:06.560
vault stories and gold that he made oh I can't remember the rest I need the rest of it it's in

04:18:06.560 --> 04:18:14.080
another in I said another in she doesn't she doesn't go here right we're just gonna if you

04:18:14.080 --> 04:18:18.560
want to skip this quest literally just time sink and he will teleport because it's just such a

04:18:19.760 --> 04:18:24.240
whatever way you go about it you know the 3d will be lit yeah I don't have a clue like

04:18:24.240 --> 04:18:31.600
they baby had like such a gorgeous 3d model but I'm like 9 in percent sure that shitting vr chat

04:18:32.000 --> 04:18:39.760
um but I don't know what it is and I'm not sure any of the girls have 3d experience either to

04:18:39.760 --> 04:18:45.760
help me out the best I can do is like 3d vr chat but I don't know if that's disappointing for them

04:18:46.720 --> 04:18:56.560
um well maybe ask sin sin is vr chat I asked her and I was quite happy with her model like

04:18:56.720 --> 04:19:03.920
um and I think that's like what the girls are if they're one 3d like that's all of God you know

04:19:06.320 --> 04:19:09.760
um I'll be a learning experience for all vr chat streams being created with you know

04:19:09.760 --> 04:19:17.680
could you imagine aces dg sessions in for your chat yeah it's it's not necessarily a lot of work

04:19:17.680 --> 04:19:25.040
because I just oh you can't wait in this location damn game forces you east empire company warehouse

04:19:25.760 --> 04:19:30.400
I wonder if that was by the British Empire British um

04:19:33.120 --> 04:19:36.960
so this level you're supposed to like alert from this guy but

04:19:38.960 --> 04:19:51.120
uh yeah I need to offer the girls um what are they called all the trackers but I myself don't

04:19:51.120 --> 04:19:56.000
actually know what trackers they need and I don't know what the full price point is like I've

04:19:56.000 --> 04:20:01.280
been really open and honest with the girls and been like obviously once everyone's monetized we

04:20:01.280 --> 04:20:06.160
can see what kind of money you're earning and if it's good it's bad like because obviously if the

04:20:06.160 --> 04:20:12.480
girls money's low they're not going to want to stick around are they um so I do have some kind of like

04:20:12.640 --> 04:20:18.720
um mildly boosting efforts but it's not really

04:20:20.720 --> 04:20:27.200
yeah you know it's kind of when you're on the managing side it's kind of like I can only

04:20:27.200 --> 04:20:31.840
do so much with what the girls give me very thankfully the girls are giving me they're all

04:20:31.840 --> 04:20:36.160
like literally everyone streamed every single day which was insane within reason of course

04:20:36.720 --> 04:20:41.760
um and like they're taking it a bit more easy this week which I'm very glad to see we do

04:20:43.280 --> 04:20:49.040
almost I'm a sneak increase yeah or do you think he notices me at all yeah no

04:20:50.800 --> 04:20:58.080
uh there are some really nice uh things you can do in VR chat I have seen something I didn't

04:20:58.080 --> 04:21:05.280
what detected me oh oh no he's discovering all the dead bodies along the way but he

04:21:05.280 --> 04:21:07.440
doesn't find that suspicious like at all

04:21:10.960 --> 04:21:16.480
I don't know if my my poor heart can take stronti in 3d it would be so fun because you can see how

04:21:16.480 --> 04:21:23.840
like animated I um I thought about doing a dance 3d stream where like I play music

04:21:23.840 --> 04:21:28.320
that you guys suggest and like we just dance and drink and stuff I don't know is that weird

04:21:35.600 --> 04:21:45.440
um just a body nothing so so legit oh well it mustn't be anything um I thought that would

04:21:45.440 --> 04:21:50.160
be cute like rating your songs and stuff but I don't know how good the tracking is like because I

04:21:50.160 --> 04:21:58.320
want I want to see my butt jiggle I won't be twerking and stuff I know the year is transparent

04:21:58.320 --> 04:22:02.080
and it's really endearing how come I draw to making sure everyone eats good both the talents and

04:22:02.080 --> 04:22:11.200
fun it's right here in my favorite I just uh is he gonna just check to me I mean clearly he just

04:22:11.200 --> 04:22:23.840
doesn't care if someone go oh um 3d stronti hypnotizes you that'll be interesting like I just don't

04:22:23.840 --> 04:22:30.080
know how 3d works at all I think vain or like sony notes are the default for most tracking I've seen

04:22:30.080 --> 04:22:36.560
VR avatars of pendulum and spiral tall everyone just the exception stronti

04:22:43.040 --> 04:22:47.760
okay so he does a little uh jabate where he actually comes walking back which is why I'm

04:22:47.760 --> 04:22:56.720
hanging back right now because he's a wee liar um but yeah 3d definitely on the cards we're just

04:22:57.680 --> 04:23:04.800
obviously we're kind of in the recoup funds stage um and kind of seeing where everyone is of

04:23:04.800 --> 04:23:08.880
everyone happy like I sent the girls all a message I was like is there anything I can do to make your

04:23:08.880 --> 04:23:13.280
experience better like how do you feel after your first week and I got like a lot of good feedback so

04:23:14.560 --> 04:23:21.200
um I'm just gonna be getting ready to get the girls shorts more consistently

04:23:22.160 --> 04:23:28.880
because it's taking me a hot second to get shorts out I was hoping to at least get them

04:23:28.880 --> 04:23:34.160
like two a week out right now it's like a one-wing oops and that's just because I suck

04:23:36.080 --> 04:23:40.960
and I'm gonna fall in the water stronti but don't jiggle jiggle it falls

04:23:43.040 --> 04:23:48.160
my money don't jiggle jiggle it falls I like to see you wiggle wiggle for sure

04:23:48.880 --> 04:23:55.680
by the way when our membership expected to become available on tomorrow's stream um

04:23:56.320 --> 04:24:04.160
I'm gonna get it all set up um and all of that so tomorrow's stream isn't gonna be Skyrim

04:24:04.720 --> 04:24:08.160
we're not gonna do full achievements because I don't know why my achievements aren't working

04:24:10.240 --> 04:24:12.720
there are enemies all over here but you can just go swinging

04:24:13.040 --> 04:24:16.960
you picked a bad time to get lost I think if

04:24:21.040 --> 04:24:27.440
this is no there is a health potion stacked over there somewhere I remember correctly

04:24:30.560 --> 04:24:37.040
oh I thought there was a health potion here I guess no it's just Wayne close enough

04:24:37.920 --> 04:24:42.720
we can sell these potion restraints so there's just spiders in there I don't know if there's

04:24:42.720 --> 04:24:48.960
anything else you can just go willy nilly through this it's not really um no magic I hate magic

04:24:50.400 --> 04:24:55.280
I don't want to go I can literally hear that spider in that cave it's membership gonna stream

04:24:55.280 --> 04:25:00.800
yeah it's tomorrow so the the Skyrim part two is getting steam rolled over to make way for the

04:25:00.800 --> 04:25:07.680
monetization stream and then I'm like 100% sure you guys know exactly what I'm doing tomorrow

04:25:07.680 --> 04:25:17.200
it's not even gonna be a surprise at this point um but just yeah this is just gonna be a one

04:25:17.200 --> 04:25:23.440
off Skyrim because if the achievements were working then yeah but I don't know why they're not so we

04:25:23.440 --> 04:25:30.880
might actually do calming a bit earlier than expected she be as live again yes she be cotton boom

04:25:30.880 --> 04:25:45.760
any any cotton boom um oh my god oh he's armored up who's next archer oh

04:25:45.760 --> 04:25:57.680
I have no idea I'm just stupid to figure out are you wait do you know do you guys wait just

04:25:57.680 --> 04:26:03.520
take a guess at what you think my monetization stream tomorrow is take a guess and I'll see if

04:26:03.520 --> 04:26:11.760
you guys know I'll tell you if you got it right or not right where's the guy he should be here

04:26:12.480 --> 04:26:13.040
oh there is

04:26:15.280 --> 04:26:21.360
right yeah feet yeah okay feet stream it's feet ASMR I'm gonna have the camera

04:26:22.560 --> 04:26:27.680
on my feet and because I have decks there in my toes I'm literally gonna hold the ASMR

04:26:27.760 --> 04:26:37.200
tools with my toes and do like ASMR feet stream that's me yeah feet yeah I like to

04:26:37.200 --> 04:26:46.640
it's ridiculous I know yeah I know it's ridiculous but I thought it was funny as anything and

04:26:46.640 --> 04:26:53.360
because my model has like french tip toes I thought like yeah it's perfect I don't think my other

04:26:53.440 --> 04:26:58.400
toes are gonna heal in time for it though unfortunately it's pretty mangled I don't

04:26:59.600 --> 04:27:03.600
I don't think I have to go to the doctor I think I have to go to the doctor if it starts getting

04:27:03.600 --> 04:27:10.960
inflamed you needed to know more now tell you what consider me your new friend in the north

04:27:10.960 --> 04:27:15.920
I'm keeping the deed any objections consider it again Carlisle didn't even want it why did

04:27:16.000 --> 04:27:22.880
card like a purchase golden thing now that I know who she maven if if I was maven okay

04:27:22.880 --> 04:27:28.720
blah blah blah blah blah wait I must have spent a lot of time and resources would be

04:27:31.680 --> 04:27:38.080
demonetized I mean can you get demonetized it's literally just fee like uh if you kind of take

04:27:38.080 --> 04:27:44.160
away the ha ha funny from it it's literally just a body part and ASMR and like me is that dog

04:27:44.400 --> 04:27:46.480
what um I heard that

04:27:49.520 --> 04:27:54.640
okay gods could you get any more perfect that's the only concept I came up for like my monetization

04:27:54.640 --> 04:28:03.360
celebration um people walk on their feet all the time yeah like I just think it's more like funny

04:28:03.360 --> 04:28:09.120
ha ha than it is like anything else but like I this time so I don't keep repeating it but I

04:28:09.120 --> 04:28:14.240
genuinely like feel so feminine now that I've got like my little manicure pedicure like I felt

04:28:14.240 --> 04:28:20.000
so pampered like I was completely uncomfortable with the entire situation but I did feel really

04:28:20.000 --> 04:28:26.480
pampered and I was like oh this is actually kind of nice hold on a minute hold on a minute these

04:28:26.480 --> 04:28:33.200
gender norms have hands god damn it not again I've fallen for another one it's too difficult

04:28:33.920 --> 04:28:39.840
it's too difficult I can't resist I thought I could can you really not jump this oh fine

04:28:41.280 --> 04:28:46.000
you are very feminine literally like apparently my hands are super small as well like oh

04:28:47.200 --> 04:28:49.040
these gender norms have hands

04:28:50.640 --> 04:28:58.240
foot rubs though I will admit the foot rub that felt like heavenly oh my god like my like brain

04:28:58.240 --> 04:29:03.600
was like a wire and funny I was like hold on this is like super relaxing I can't believe it all the

04:29:03.600 --> 04:29:10.000
freaking stereotypes about whamming like in foot rubs are true it's awful I felt I felt so good

04:29:10.000 --> 04:29:16.400
though I was like damn I need a need a reflin right now I need a need a sacrificial a sacrificial

04:29:16.400 --> 04:29:22.160
reef one right now oh can I do that at the convention if we do a convention oh my god I'm

04:29:22.160 --> 04:29:25.760
literally going through all the Skyrim right now just to get to the other side of the map

04:29:26.320 --> 04:29:32.720
is strong he's a girl I can't believe it I'm more impressed with her dexterity how much dexterity

04:29:32.720 --> 04:29:39.600
you have for your toes honestly my grippers on a rock you'll never guess what I'm sitting on right

04:29:39.600 --> 04:29:47.520
now take a guess what did you need I volunteer literally should I just do that where you're

04:29:47.520 --> 04:29:55.440
like massage my feet at the convention oh he said oh wait no I have sweaty feet oh I can't

04:29:55.440 --> 04:29:59.600
let yous do that the reason why the women could do it is because I had to put my feet in like this

04:29:59.600 --> 04:30:04.960
little water bath so she had no clue that she was dealing with the sweaty feet in the west

04:30:07.040 --> 04:30:12.000
so we're now learning that Carlaya is this evil evil trying to take down the thieves guild so we're

04:30:12.000 --> 04:30:19.360
gonna meet and mercer free or sorry mercer free and I if you want the correct english are going to

04:30:19.360 --> 04:30:27.040
go and confront them um and it's called scoundrels foley oh no I've just completed that I'm actually

04:30:27.040 --> 04:30:33.920
such a lawyer oh wait I need I'm freaking sick says exchange a piece of armor but we're about to

04:30:33.920 --> 04:30:38.480
get more armor anyway so it's fine don't worry guys I'll take one for the team everyone here

04:30:38.480 --> 04:30:45.600
volunteer and to be sacrificial refund my poor refunds what have I done he is honestly uh no

04:30:45.680 --> 04:30:48.000
way this is like the closest landmark

04:30:51.200 --> 04:30:55.360
it's gonna be a bit of a wonk I feel like I'm still level one why do I refuse to level up

04:30:56.480 --> 04:30:57.360
level up

04:30:59.760 --> 04:31:05.440
it doesn't matter what you're sitting on we cry because it's not us right there's someone on I

04:31:05.440 --> 04:31:10.560
don't know if you guys like you swear too much but there's someone on twitter literally called like

04:31:25.040 --> 04:31:30.880
just travel to white rune stable and buy a carry oh you are actually so correct however we might

04:31:30.880 --> 04:31:40.000
meet Cicero on the road so there is a chance I have faith let's run that guy literally we

04:31:40.000 --> 04:31:48.560
know actually down the screen whoa who are you oh you're a kaji are you mark at the liar

04:31:57.440 --> 04:32:01.840

about the domestication of animals as well think of how many endless animal species we have

04:33:04.720 --> 04:33:11.680
and there's only I think 11 domesticated species isn't that amazing although there was one russian

04:33:11.680 --> 04:33:16.880
guy who tried to domesticate foxes and he actually got really far but it does take years and years

04:33:18.800 --> 04:33:21.520
you can hypnotize a chicken by drawing the line and dirt in front of them

04:33:22.320 --> 04:33:27.680
oh oh oh I was a little moaned to head there please email them thank you

04:33:29.280 --> 04:33:30.960
uh there's a little shack down here

04:33:35.280 --> 04:33:42.400
domesticated foxes would be adorable they would oh there's a bear in this shack I recognize this

04:33:42.400 --> 04:33:51.200
place from many I totally I've never heard a wolf how old like that before but

04:33:51.600 --> 04:33:56.080
Lydia can you deal with them so I don't have to slow down I'm trying to make it to the

04:33:57.280 --> 04:34:04.240
uh location there is probably bandits here actually that's one thing I do have to complain

04:34:04.240 --> 04:34:11.200
about Skyrim there's like bandits in every freaking place ever literally I've not even approached

04:34:11.200 --> 04:34:17.120
this landmark and it's like yeah bandits by the way it's like bro I didn't even get a freaking chance

04:34:17.200 --> 04:34:22.080
to breathe there's always a bear foxes are difficult the worst part is they pee on everything

04:34:23.200 --> 04:34:31.840
fox girl gen two confirmed made it into pee allure confirmed right there's a stable over here so

04:34:31.840 --> 04:34:43.680
we're gonna head for it what's the difference between taming and domesticating taming is temp

04:34:43.680 --> 04:34:48.320
horary friendship whereas domestication anyone can take over with it I think

04:34:49.040 --> 04:34:59.440
because you can tame a wild hedgehog but you can't domesticate it yeah no that kind of sounds like

04:34:59.440 --> 04:35:04.720
I'm on the right tracks but I did just I don't actually know the real can you please discover

04:35:04.720 --> 04:35:14.960
that thank you just sweet time peeler my beloved peeler confirmed by stroney fox girl for peeler

04:35:14.960 --> 04:35:23.840
lmao let the only reason they're in is because of the the content the girls like to put up

04:35:25.520 --> 04:35:30.320
domestication is an extremely long process of taming yes I would agree with that statement

04:35:30.960 --> 04:35:35.040
well they put fast travel on so they had to compensate for people who'd fast travel instead

04:35:35.040 --> 04:35:40.400
of walk and they need more bandits oh bro every time you want to walk like two centimeters the

04:35:40.400 --> 04:35:45.840
game's like enemy enemy enemy enemy taming is when you train a wild animal to be friendly around

04:35:45.840 --> 04:35:50.880
humans domestications when you breed an animal over multiple generations to benefit a human yes

04:35:50.880 --> 04:36:01.440
so a lot of people don't know that sheep um infinitely grow will that's because of human

04:36:01.440 --> 04:36:07.120
selective breeding that they produce so much will and they've now required to be shaved

04:36:07.120 --> 04:36:11.840
like you ever hear those stories that make the news that's like this sheep evaded the farmer for

04:36:11.840 --> 04:36:19.200
five years and he has five years of like mats on him and the only reason that's actually even mildly

04:36:19.200 --> 04:36:24.960
possible is because he was bred that way he was bred to produce like copious amounts of wool

04:36:25.760 --> 04:36:31.200
and and it's like the same for horses you know how horses need little clippy cloppy horses

04:36:31.200 --> 04:36:37.680
the reason for that is because of selective breeding and and the horse in the wild will

04:36:37.680 --> 04:36:46.400
naturally wear down its rocks its hooves on rocks and stuff like that and what is going on here who's

04:36:46.960 --> 04:36:49.520
our key um

04:36:51.840 --> 04:36:58.400
like yeah silkworms we use for silk can't survive in the wild yeah i would really love to do a

04:36:58.400 --> 04:37:07.120
domestication thing um i'd love to do a history one i just saw that on a perforx that wolf garden

04:37:08.720 --> 04:37:13.760
huh i don't think i've ever seen a sheep on the news yeah when you come from scotland sometimes

04:37:13.760 --> 04:37:21.840
the news is rather bland um you know not a lot going on in scotland if you watch the scottish news

04:37:21.840 --> 04:37:32.400
oh no he didn't mate why why does the horse who's horse is that hello i'm sorry i'm late

04:37:32.960 --> 04:37:40.320
good we're finally hydration check i've scouted the ruins and i'm certain carliah is still inside

04:37:40.480 --> 04:37:44.080
you saw her no i found her horse

04:37:45.280 --> 04:37:52.320
don't take care of it that horse didn't need to perish let's get moving i want to catch her

04:37:52.320 --> 04:37:58.880
inside while she's distracted take the lead you want me to lead understood just make certain

04:37:58.880 --> 04:38:05.360
you keep your eyes open carliah is selectively breeding wiflings to four you can't say that

04:38:05.360 --> 04:38:14.160
that's hilarious you can't say that oh my god that's so true what the fuck that's so funny i'm

04:38:14.160 --> 04:38:27.840
sorry i can't even laugh at that that's so funny um i'd rather the news be bland than hyperpolarizing

04:38:27.840 --> 04:38:34.240
oh i don't even consume the news anymore where where are you bro i can hear your armor what are you

04:38:34.960 --> 04:38:40.880
okay there you are jeez is everyone because she's growing so much will have actually become a

04:38:40.880 --> 04:38:45.440
deficient sheep farmers don't make any money from willson synthetic fibers if a police will

04:38:46.160 --> 04:38:56.560
we have to go back we need to go back please please no more plastic i'd like same i hate watching

04:38:56.560 --> 04:39:04.640
yeah like it's just unwatchable it just you you'll finish a news broadcast um and you're just like

04:39:04.640 --> 04:39:10.240
wow i hate life and it was like don't if if you consume things that like genuinely make you

04:39:10.240 --> 04:39:16.080
more upset at the end of them it's it can be quite addictive and comforting to like watch it in the

04:39:16.080 --> 04:39:22.880
moment but when you realize it's bad for you like you can just kind of posthump on it you know come

04:39:22.880 --> 04:39:29.040
back another time uh there are droggers up ahead but it's not anything we can't

04:39:34.880 --> 04:39:41.200
uh the droggers i'm actually gonna loot them the reason because a lot of droggers drop um

04:39:41.200 --> 04:39:45.760
um soul gems which i'm needing a heck of a lot more of

04:39:48.960 --> 04:39:53.440
i said they drop soul gems

04:39:56.640 --> 04:40:07.040
soul gems se oh ah oh gems i can see that but i don't mean whoa okay sorry i'm sorry please

04:40:07.040 --> 04:40:10.800
forgive me for pill in the lever i didn't mean i promise i won't do it again we all

04:40:15.440 --> 04:40:18.160
okay they're just dropping gems i couldn't freaking

04:40:20.960 --> 04:40:23.040
uh i didn't even get a chance to wiggle it

04:40:27.200 --> 04:40:29.200
no no

04:40:29.600 --> 04:40:31.600
oh

04:40:34.560 --> 04:40:41.680
oh potions lovely i'll sell them for pennies honestly will is still warm even oh wait sorry

04:40:41.680 --> 04:40:46.160
sorry i was looking at the corner of my eye oh ah

04:40:48.800 --> 04:40:55.280

04:40:55.280 --> 04:41:02.480
have soul gems on them oh the the centaurians have um the the good golden guys no

04:41:06.400 --> 04:41:14.400
i'm like going left side i'm like okay there we go so many soul gems okay they just have gold

04:41:14.480 --> 04:41:16.400
on them apparently we

04:41:19.680 --> 04:41:25.360
get it your feeble attempts he's like so

04:41:29.280 --> 04:41:35.280
nope don't ask me how long it took me to find the opening to this so my first playthrough

04:41:35.280 --> 04:41:44.160
it's so painful this was my first ever um skyrim game actually my dad played morrow and um

04:41:45.360 --> 04:41:50.800
but my my favorite thing about morrowind is that you can just jump on the spot um

04:41:52.960 --> 04:41:55.520
and then like you level up your stamina it's quite interesting

04:41:58.320 --> 04:42:03.520
oh i can do this you mean elder school's game yeah wait what did i say my first skyrim game

04:42:04.240 --> 04:42:07.520
sad oh my dumb dumb

04:42:11.040 --> 04:42:18.400
and he i was gonna say it's even oh no not me right now ryan hey stroney i wanted to ask you

04:42:18.400 --> 04:42:23.440
something yeah i know you can speak scott but i was curious to know if you knew gaelic as well

04:42:23.440 --> 04:42:28.560
cause if i remember correctly there's not that many people left in scotland that can speak it

04:42:28.560 --> 04:42:33.680
no they don't teach us that uh if you come from the mainland you don't learn gaelic at all

04:42:34.240 --> 04:42:41.200
um it's basically a dying language because they refuse to teach it to the next generation

04:42:41.920 --> 04:42:47.760
i don't know if it's gonna change i hope it'll change in the future but sadly no i do not speak

04:42:47.760 --> 04:42:54.800
gaelic which is just how it is they do not teach it and oh pretty shit

04:42:55.040 --> 04:43:04.640
um but thank you for the tip narrow yes uh very sadly the they don't teach it uh if you're from

04:43:04.640 --> 04:43:10.400
the mainland of scotland and i am from the mainland of scotland if you didn't know lovely little uh

04:43:10.400 --> 04:43:22.560
scot wait no did i mean to do that i don't think i meant to do that did i um if i didn't come from

04:43:22.560 --> 04:43:28.080
the mainland and i came from the shetland for example which is at the north some it's okay

04:43:28.080 --> 04:43:33.680
if you don't really know scotland that well um where the heck is this red on the map that i get

04:43:34.320 --> 04:43:35.280
am i going the right way

04:43:38.240 --> 04:43:41.520
yel skeever okay i'm going the right way i don't know how to do that

04:43:42.640 --> 04:43:46.640
that's so sad gaelic is one of the very few Celtic languages out left yeah like um

04:43:47.200 --> 04:43:51.200
uh something's here scotland and ireland and all that were like pagan

04:43:51.840 --> 04:43:58.560
fucking hell this is a lot of enemies got enemies got a lot of enemies i'm just swanging

04:44:00.240 --> 04:44:06.720
i'm just swinging around my new ones business honestly me if i was a guy i'd be elephant and

04:44:06.720 --> 04:44:10.960
that stuff up

04:44:15.280 --> 04:44:20.240
i'm 42 i'm leveling up faster than my fishing and runescape

04:44:22.000 --> 04:44:26.560
although you still need a trans a translator for glass region yes the scots is the

04:44:27.280 --> 04:44:34.800
he just like went flying uh you really wanted that um

04:44:37.200 --> 04:44:42.880
there's poison darts if i remember correctly yeah i'm just too good i just remember everything

04:44:42.880 --> 04:44:51.360
honestly um yes i am very lucky that i do have scots at least which is recognized as its own

04:44:51.360 --> 04:44:57.680
language which is really cool and i know it sounds like i'm like speaking that's because

04:44:57.680 --> 04:45:04.480
i don't use slang at all like at all um oh we're almost there uh we're almost there

04:45:08.160 --> 04:45:08.480
um

04:45:12.560 --> 04:45:17.760
uh i'm completely forgotten what was happening about i hate these guys because they can yeah

04:45:17.760 --> 04:45:26.000
they can disarm you which i don't like wait he he has special

04:45:29.200 --> 04:45:37.200
eh i've never seen this before this is not freaking xbox certified flawed barla stone

04:45:37.200 --> 04:45:47.120
what the heck is that why why did why did pc yell these cool things what the heck is a wireless stone

04:45:48.240 --> 04:45:55.360
can you do a fool on scottish dream uh i mean if you mean slang i can only really do it for

04:45:55.360 --> 04:46:02.400
like a couple of minutes because it's just like i get more mumbly and like oh good morning good

04:46:02.400 --> 04:46:08.640
evening good afternoon and all that who's it going like it just doesn't really sound that good and

04:46:08.640 --> 04:46:15.120
i don't think it's that relaxing either like and i kind of hate to put it on because my mom was like

04:46:15.120 --> 04:46:21.840
no then he speaks slang in the house so i didn't and then obviously being an online creator

04:46:22.560 --> 04:46:26.720
it's the complete opposite everyone wants to hear you with a slang in every hand and it's like oh

04:46:26.720 --> 04:46:33.520
right then i guess it's a bit uh it's a bit forced because i was discouraged from speaking

04:46:33.520 --> 04:46:42.000
words these doors have a weakness pc got updates xbox charges per update plus pc got lots of content

04:46:42.960 --> 04:46:45.360
xbox charges per update i don't know

04:46:48.960 --> 04:46:52.720
it's just a bit pointless learning gaelic when english is so common yeah like oh

04:46:54.640 --> 04:47:01.040
i ain't looking good i ain't looking good i'm gonna take a nap right here

04:47:01.040 --> 04:47:08.800
can you talk dirty scott's if you want

04:47:11.520 --> 04:47:17.120
and a member stream sure yeah i remember liby saying some scott's can't pronounce for yeah

04:47:18.080 --> 04:47:23.680
so if i say how i normally annunciate purple burglar alarm like i can't do it but if i put on

04:47:23.680 --> 04:47:30.160
a harsh accent my tongue gets caught at the back of my mouth like a purple burglar alarm

04:47:30.240 --> 04:47:34.800
like a lalalala and you can hear that yuki's temper is gone forever

04:47:36.960 --> 04:47:42.320
it was the first lesson gallas taught us hey sweet ania

04:47:44.720 --> 04:47:49.040
gallas had his wealth and he had you all he had to do was look the other way

04:47:52.240 --> 04:47:57.760
garner did you expect him to simply ignore your methods and all the most recent versions of the

04:47:57.840 --> 04:48:05.440
game my ps4 even got these updates you know it's time for you and gallas to become reunited

super chat i said that before she was like how long until someone asked for purple burglar alarm

he delayed the shipment even another week the legion would find someone else to take it south

04:58:04.160 --> 04:58:09.200
let them keep their blasted money the road to white run is dangerous he says everyone knows

04:58:09.200 --> 04:58:13.200
that so many caravans have been attacked so many travelers vanished into thin air some say it's

04:58:13.200 --> 04:58:18.240
only bandits but they're rumors are worse goblins ghosts and witches 20 years we've been married

04:58:18.240 --> 04:58:21.920
now and i can't bear the thought of losing them i'm not letting them go alone not this time we'll

04:58:21.920 --> 04:58:31.200
never die together together mara preservas oh where's the man oh no

04:58:34.960 --> 04:58:42.000
oh who to who to uh it's terrible picks up coins oh who did that that's terrible

04:58:42.560 --> 04:58:50.240
uh coconut crab vtuber oh isn't that not that massive gigantic crab

04:58:54.560 --> 04:59:00.480
v suckies gen two's name by the way yeah gen two already i already have the logos for gen two and

04:59:00.480 --> 04:59:05.680
three made um because they were they it was like cheap and it was like i might as well lost them

04:59:05.680 --> 04:59:11.200
out because i already know what i'm gonna call them i'm just gonna discover this location i don't

04:59:11.200 --> 04:59:15.600
know if we're gonna start going against the force one shortly there are another type of bandits

04:59:15.600 --> 04:59:25.040
essentially uh right how do i get around i guess i get around oh no robbs corpses look

04:59:25.760 --> 04:59:29.760
they're not gonna need it let's be honest they're not gonna need that those nine coins

04:59:29.760 --> 04:59:34.640
gen three spoiled no there's absolutely nothing planned of gen three i don't even know what concepts

04:59:34.640 --> 04:59:41.680
i want and stroney did you see what you want yes what i want i submit what i want and then i

04:59:41.680 --> 04:59:44.560
get back something and then i keep going to the drawing board that's how it works

04:59:47.120 --> 04:59:58.480
so you're at my mercy shoulda picked mercy you can't purchase in the afterlife gen six

04:59:59.040 --> 05:00:07.920
absolutely no i am done birthing any children after gen three i mean it's also like uh there's a

05:00:07.920 --> 05:00:14.320
whole other thing to it there's actually a whole other trust factor as well like gen one i completely

05:00:14.320 --> 05:00:19.200
trust wholeheartedly um like i did my thorough research on the girls and like when i when i

05:00:19.200 --> 05:00:25.920
did the interview like i never got any bad vibes or whatever um which sounds terrible like oh you

05:00:25.920 --> 05:00:30.960
did an interview like an informal interview and went off of was there bad vibes or not and the

05:00:30.960 --> 05:00:38.960
answer is yeah i did actually um because and when you hear people talk you can get a sense of like

05:00:38.960 --> 05:00:45.280
especially when they expect it like a super um like a super professional thing and you're just

05:00:45.280 --> 05:00:50.640
like oh surprise it's actually just me me man uh here's here's the rules type thing um mercy's

05:00:50.720 --> 05:00:54.720
patreon just went live oh she got an update i can't even remember what her update was

05:00:57.040 --> 05:01:02.480
i i don't know i don't know what the tags are even though i was the one who put that up there for

05:01:02.480 --> 05:01:08.080
her sounds like you got a trust you got yeah like i i get described as naive a lot which i

05:01:08.080 --> 05:01:12.960
honestly don't mind i actually genuinely agree with that and kind of assessment sorry i'm just

05:01:12.960 --> 05:01:18.560
trying to hit loads of markers along the way so we can just backtrack like this super easily

05:01:19.520 --> 05:01:25.920
um oh is this like a little hunter's lodge thing going on oh it's like a little campsite oh

05:01:30.800 --> 05:01:37.040
anyway we eating good tonight after three generations there's a real a real risk of bad

05:01:37.040 --> 05:01:46.400
actors trying to get in that software yeah so because um i need to choose my words carefully

05:01:47.120 --> 05:01:56.480
but i hope you can agree with um my my my thought process but it may not be reality because it's

05:01:56.480 --> 05:02:06.320
just my thought process um it is very plausible that there were vtubers who were interested but

05:02:06.320 --> 05:02:13.200
didn't apply because they wanted the guaranteed success of gen 2 like to see what gen 1 achieved

05:02:13.200 --> 05:02:22.000
to see what gen 2 achieved because not that they didn't put their faith in the plan

05:02:24.800 --> 05:02:28.560
it's not so obviously you want to you want to be a part something that's successful let's

05:02:28.560 --> 05:02:36.560
wait am i on the right way or am i on the wrong way no i'm gonna write um i need to try and think

05:02:36.560 --> 05:02:47.920
of my sense just like i'm really happy with gen 1 and everyone is good basically however the rate

05:02:47.920 --> 05:02:55.120
as you said the rate of a bad actor coming into play does get higher um

05:02:58.080 --> 05:03:03.760
but hopefully you know there's girls like with you know plenty of experience and i can just

05:03:03.760 --> 05:03:11.760
see and assess them you don't want to risk the gamble yes it's like i don't know how to say that

05:03:11.760 --> 05:03:17.840
i just knew all the girls i'm trying to have a really nice moment talking about my girls okay um

05:03:20.000 --> 05:03:27.040
the risk does get higher when new people are introduced that may not have previous history

05:03:27.040 --> 05:03:32.480
like um what the heck what am i trying to do where the heck am i trying to go

05:03:34.480 --> 05:03:37.680
you can't see me um

05:03:41.280 --> 05:03:43.680
i think you're doing the right thing you don't want to feel like you're even

05:03:43.680 --> 05:03:50.960
messed up in the wrong thing yes that like um i did speak of someone who applied and then i went

05:03:50.960 --> 05:03:56.080
on their twitch just to check them out in general and they spoke about how they only want to hang

05:03:56.080 --> 05:04:03.040
around for one year and then send their audience to their old account and the quote was like because

05:04:03.040 --> 05:04:11.200
the creator seems so chill or something and i got an in route um and it was just like kind of shocking

05:04:12.160 --> 05:04:18.080
and it does like kind of slap me back to reality that like people who apply they might not actually

05:04:18.080 --> 05:04:24.000
want to hang around and achieve like loads of goals they might just do it to go do their own thing

05:04:24.960 --> 05:04:31.360
the lover stone this always feels the comforts of love all skills improve faster

05:04:32.720 --> 05:04:36.560
if all skills improve faster then sure call me the lover stone

05:04:38.560 --> 05:04:45.520
uh who would put that on social me out what wow you know that really happened um

05:04:46.720 --> 05:04:51.920
they uh applied their application and i pretty much checked out everyone's stream

05:04:52.720 --> 05:04:58.560
um uh after they applied just to see what they were putting out there because um there was a

05:04:58.560 --> 05:05:05.680
very notable trend of people applying and then all of a sudden their stream uh consistency ramped up

05:05:05.680 --> 05:05:10.080
because they were getting assessed and they were aware they were getting assessed uh i don't think

05:05:10.080 --> 05:05:17.360
i didn't notice that if you were one of those girls um uh there was also stream variety came

05:05:17.360 --> 05:05:26.400
out of nowhere some people were very glued to one type of game um and all of a sudden uh they

05:05:26.400 --> 05:05:41.520
start doing a variety of games uh kind of showing that they can play a different um but yes um i did

05:05:41.520 --> 05:05:49.120
get to experience someone who openly admitted that they basically applied but couldn't care less

05:05:49.120 --> 05:05:56.160
about the actual longevity of violour and it is quite scary to think that there's a possibility

05:05:56.960 --> 05:06:04.080
that even through my vetting process um there is a team who also assessed uh the girls that get in

05:06:04.800 --> 05:06:16.160
as well um and maybe at a later date i can maybe speak a bit more about i think now is a bit too

05:06:16.160 --> 05:06:25.120
sensitive of a time because obviously it's only been uh one week excuse me sorry just dealing with

05:06:25.120 --> 05:06:32.960
this guy he is a very bad man do not trust him are you good that man nearly killed me

05:06:44.480 --> 05:06:50.880

05:06:51.520 --> 05:06:54.560
does what affect my judgment i'm so sorry you're gonna have to go over that again

05:06:55.120 --> 05:07:01.440

05:07:01.440 --> 05:07:08.160
perfect for the character yes i i did admit that if azura did not accept uh i was essentially

05:07:08.160 --> 05:07:15.040
up shit creek because everyone who applied i was not satisfied with their fit for the voice i did

05:07:15.200 --> 05:07:22.240

i think i'm i might have

05:15:08.000 --> 05:15:11.360
i think i went completely wrong way pardon me

05:15:16.880 --> 05:15:20.240
it's barred from another site so i was going the right freaking way

05:15:21.440 --> 05:15:23.200
ah right okay let's try again

05:15:26.000 --> 05:15:32.800
i'm sure i can figure it out when i get there i feel like a some secret offer is it no these are

05:15:33.200 --> 05:15:39.680
living quarters you're the stealthiest thief ever strong and no one will see you if they're dead

05:15:39.680 --> 05:15:47.120
exactly i don't know why that's still going because i pulled a lever uh i think i did it on the other

05:15:47.120 --> 05:15:54.240
side of the poison uh i guess if you wanted to be stealth you could just go through the poison

05:15:54.240 --> 05:15:55.600
but we'll just go for it

05:15:55.760 --> 05:16:01.280
we're going we're going we're going

05:16:04.560 --> 05:16:08.800
i'm being a dome dome okay turn the off

05:16:11.760 --> 05:16:15.760
right there so it's quiet and then up the stairs literally they were right there

05:16:15.760 --> 05:16:20.720
and i walked away from them it's just feeling quirky okay just feeling misunderstood

05:16:21.280 --> 05:16:22.720
mmm

05:16:24.800 --> 05:16:30.400
just let it happen just let it happen just let it happen just let it happen it's okay

05:16:31.280 --> 05:16:32.640
just let it happen

05:16:37.680 --> 05:16:38.960
just let it happen

05:16:42.080 --> 05:16:46.400
just let it happen it's okay it's okay just let it happen

05:16:46.400 --> 05:16:51.400
Mm, big potatoes.

05:16:51.400 --> 05:16:56.400
Just, oh, 20, 20, go, enchanting.

05:16:56.400 --> 05:17:00.400
That's good, that'll be like enchanting up in here.

05:17:00.400 --> 05:17:02.400
Just let it out.

05:17:02.400 --> 05:17:05.400
Okay, we don't really need to, oh, the box, we need that.

05:17:05.400 --> 05:17:10.400
Mm, is this the barred door?

05:17:10.400 --> 05:17:13.400
It was!

05:17:13.400 --> 05:17:16.400
Okay, we've now got the shortcut.

05:17:16.400 --> 05:17:18.400
So what's this?

05:17:18.400 --> 05:17:20.400
It's a chest.

05:17:20.400 --> 05:17:22.400
And then what's that?

05:17:22.400 --> 05:17:24.400
That's just the other side of the map.

05:17:24.400 --> 05:17:25.400
Oh my god, we did it.

05:17:25.400 --> 05:17:27.400
It's not war crime if it's a cute girl.

05:17:27.400 --> 05:17:31.400
Me committing war crimes?

05:17:31.400 --> 05:17:34.400
Stop, you're making me laugh.

05:17:34.400 --> 05:17:36.400
Oh my gosh, I'm so turned around.

05:17:36.400 --> 05:17:40.400
It's been so long since I've done this.

05:17:40.400 --> 05:17:43.400
It's called barbarian stealth, honestly?

05:17:43.400 --> 05:17:46.400
I actually really like that description for my thingy.

05:17:46.400 --> 05:17:49.400
Like, I've always tried to do...

05:17:49.400 --> 05:17:52.400
What the heck?

05:17:52.400 --> 05:17:53.400
Jump shot.

05:17:53.400 --> 05:17:55.400
Oh, right, wait, what?

05:17:55.400 --> 05:17:58.400
There's a tic-tac to leave there.

05:17:58.400 --> 05:18:02.400
I don't think there's any enemies until they come in.

05:18:02.400 --> 05:18:05.400
We just need to pick up some charcoal and a piece of paper,

05:18:05.400 --> 05:18:08.400
steal the paper, steal the charcoal.

05:18:08.400 --> 05:18:12.400
It took me so long to figure out this area.

05:18:12.400 --> 05:18:14.400
Heavy armor increased to 16.

05:18:14.400 --> 05:18:16.400
Well, it wasn't really worth the level up.

05:18:16.400 --> 05:18:17.400
But hey, we did it.

05:18:17.400 --> 05:18:18.400
I'm gonna break some...

05:18:18.400 --> 05:18:20.400
Break it down now.

05:18:24.400 --> 05:18:25.400
Oh, look at that.

05:18:25.400 --> 05:18:27.400
Look at that.

05:18:27.400 --> 05:18:29.400
We do have a bow and arrow.

05:18:29.400 --> 05:18:30.400
Fire damage?

05:18:30.400 --> 05:18:31.400
Soul trap?

05:18:31.400 --> 05:18:32.400
Maybe...

05:18:32.400 --> 05:18:36.400
No, maybe not a soul trap on us.

05:18:36.400 --> 05:18:38.400
I would say fire damage.

05:18:38.400 --> 05:18:40.400
Take a little burn.

05:18:40.400 --> 05:18:41.400
Now, what?

05:18:41.400 --> 05:18:43.400
Petty or...

05:18:43.400 --> 05:18:45.400
Bubbish.

05:18:45.400 --> 05:18:46.400
You know, Seagrog.

05:18:46.400 --> 05:18:49.400
Method of stealth, honestly.

05:18:49.400 --> 05:18:52.400
Look, if it works, is there...

05:18:52.400 --> 05:18:54.400
Is there truly a point?

05:18:54.400 --> 05:18:55.400
Is there truly a point?

05:18:55.400 --> 05:18:58.400
Right, so the enemies do come in here.

05:18:58.400 --> 05:19:01.400
Obviously, because we are playing on legendary mode

05:19:01.400 --> 05:19:03.400
and I'm just so MLG pro.

05:19:03.400 --> 05:19:04.400
Yeah, excuse me.

05:19:04.400 --> 05:19:07.400
We're just gonna one-shot them, confidently.

05:19:07.400 --> 05:19:10.400
We are just going to one-shot them, confidently.

05:19:10.400 --> 05:19:13.400
We are just gonna one-shot them.

05:19:13.400 --> 05:19:15.400
Nice and confidently.

05:19:15.400 --> 05:19:17.400
No problems.

05:19:20.400 --> 05:19:23.400
CUTELY commits crimes against humanity, honestly.

05:19:25.400 --> 05:19:28.400
Have you played Ghost of Toshima?

05:19:28.400 --> 05:19:29.400
I haven't.

05:19:29.400 --> 05:19:30.400
One-shot, 100%.

05:19:30.400 --> 05:19:31.400
Return to the guy.

05:19:31.400 --> 05:19:32.400
Where's the guy?

05:19:32.400 --> 05:19:34.400
Is he in here?

05:19:34.400 --> 05:19:37.400
Oh, return to the guy, guy.

05:19:37.400 --> 05:19:40.400
Return to the guy.

05:19:40.400 --> 05:19:45.400
Walk on fire.

05:19:45.400 --> 05:19:49.400
Why the heck does it make me go backwards?

05:19:53.400 --> 05:19:54.400
I'm just...

05:19:54.400 --> 05:19:58.400
The map in is a bit rough.

05:19:59.400 --> 05:20:02.400
Can I loot this?

05:20:02.400 --> 05:20:04.400
I can't.

05:20:04.400 --> 05:20:05.400
They're so good.

05:20:05.400 --> 05:20:08.400
Wait, are the guards gonna attack me?

05:20:08.400 --> 05:20:10.400
Are the marker of guards gonna attack me?

05:20:10.400 --> 05:20:12.400
I think they might.

05:20:13.400 --> 05:20:15.400
I come back and see you're still in...

05:20:15.400 --> 05:20:17.400
Eh, no.

05:20:17.400 --> 05:20:20.400
I'm sorry, but these accusations are unfounded.

05:20:20.400 --> 05:20:21.400
I'm not a novice.

05:20:21.400 --> 05:20:24.400
I'm on legendary, clearly.

05:20:24.400 --> 05:20:26.400
Look, I'm sorry to your untrained eye,

05:20:26.400 --> 05:20:28.400
but when you get really good at the game,

05:20:28.400 --> 05:20:30.400
it just makes things...

05:20:30.400 --> 05:20:32.400
Why did it do that?

05:20:32.400 --> 05:20:34.400
Why did you do that?

05:20:34.400 --> 05:20:36.400
Why does the game do that?

05:20:36.400 --> 05:20:38.400
Honestly, I could fart on it something.

05:20:40.400 --> 05:20:42.400
Yeah, just because I'm such a high-skilled level,

05:20:42.400 --> 05:20:46.400
it makes it appear to be a very easy level.

05:20:46.400 --> 05:20:49.400
So please don't worry about it.

05:20:49.400 --> 05:20:51.400
No, okay.

05:21:00.400 --> 05:21:02.400
I've played this game for two...

05:21:02.400 --> 05:21:04.400
How dare you?

05:21:04.400 --> 05:21:06.400
Why is the child in the basement?

05:21:07.400 --> 05:21:09.400
Alright, here's the translation, bro.

05:21:11.400 --> 05:21:13.400
I'm rubbing.

05:21:15.400 --> 05:21:17.400
When you're amazing, you make everything look easy.

05:21:17.400 --> 05:21:19.400
Yeah, legendary.

05:21:21.400 --> 05:21:23.400
See how that's not valued at 50?

05:21:23.400 --> 05:21:25.400
It's not going to teach you nothing.

05:21:25.400 --> 05:21:27.400
Don't open that book.

05:21:29.400 --> 05:21:32.400
Maybe sometime you should judge a book by cover.

05:21:37.400 --> 05:21:40.400
Mercer Frey is the baddie.

05:21:41.400 --> 05:21:43.400
Dun-dun-dun!

05:21:46.400 --> 05:21:48.400
He's trying to once you rub him.

05:21:50.400 --> 05:21:52.400
That's actually my specialty.

05:22:06.400 --> 05:22:08.400
The Nightingales!

05:22:10.400 --> 05:22:13.400
It seems to describe the failure of the Nightingales,

05:22:13.400 --> 05:22:16.400
although it doesn't go into great detail.

05:22:16.400 --> 05:22:18.400
Gallus also repeatedly mentions

05:22:18.400 --> 05:22:20.400
his strong belief that Mercer desecrated

05:22:20.400 --> 05:22:23.400
something known as the Twilight Sepulcher.

05:22:27.400 --> 05:22:30.400
She bawled under that hood.

05:22:31.400 --> 05:22:33.400
Baw headed in.

05:22:36.400 --> 05:22:38.400
The annoying hint is actually the bad guy.

05:22:38.400 --> 05:22:40.400
I'm shocked, colouring me surprised.

05:22:42.400 --> 05:22:45.400
Golden writing standards by the dev team.

05:22:47.400 --> 05:22:48.400
Bald!

05:22:48.400 --> 05:22:50.400
It always annoyed me when you put on a hood,

05:22:50.400 --> 05:22:53.400
your hair gets removed

05:22:53.400 --> 05:22:55.400
and annoys me so much.

05:22:57.400 --> 05:22:59.400
It's just such a...

05:23:01.400 --> 05:23:03.400
Excuse you, anyone talking to you?

05:23:03.400 --> 05:23:07.400
Listen, all I want is the truth to be revealed to the guild.

05:23:07.400 --> 05:23:10.400
They respected Carlaya and she deserves better.

05:23:10.400 --> 05:23:13.400
Do whatever you can and I'd consider it a personal favour.

05:23:13.400 --> 05:23:15.400
Sure, thank you.

05:23:15.400 --> 05:23:17.400
If you ever manage to gain entry to the college

05:23:17.400 --> 05:23:20.400
and you find trying to rid yourself of stolen goods...

05:23:20.400 --> 05:23:22.400
He's a fan!

05:23:22.400 --> 05:23:25.400
I've been known to handle items of questionable interest

05:23:25.400 --> 05:23:27.400
from time to time.

05:23:27.400 --> 05:23:29.400
Questionable interest, I like that.

05:23:29.400 --> 05:23:31.400
We must hasten to rift in before Mercer can do any more...

05:23:31.400 --> 05:23:33.400
We must hasten to rift in!

05:23:38.400 --> 05:23:40.400
Bald gent who member confirmed...

05:23:40.400 --> 05:23:42.400
No! No!

05:23:42.400 --> 05:23:44.400
Say it ain't so.

05:23:44.400 --> 05:23:46.400
I will not go.

05:23:46.400 --> 05:23:47.400
Turn the lights off.

05:23:47.400 --> 05:23:49.400
Carry me home.

05:23:52.400 --> 05:23:54.400
Oh my god, members carry okay.

05:23:54.400 --> 05:23:56.400
I can absolutely wreck my voice on that.

05:23:57.400 --> 05:23:59.400
I can get beer.

05:23:59.400 --> 05:24:01.400
I can get beer!

05:24:01.400 --> 05:24:04.400
And we can do membership karaoke.

05:24:05.400 --> 05:24:07.400
And I can do song requests.

05:24:07.400 --> 05:24:09.400
You guys put it together.

05:24:09.400 --> 05:24:11.400
I'll be pretty good.

05:24:26.400 --> 05:24:28.400
I'll drink till you spew.

05:24:36.400 --> 05:24:40.400
Carla currently and kindly explaining the Nightingale lore

05:24:40.400 --> 05:24:42.400
and her relationship to Gallus

05:24:42.400 --> 05:24:45.400
whilst I sing that one beer parody song

05:24:45.400 --> 05:24:48.400
that had that Lego animation.

05:24:48.400 --> 05:24:50.400
Why are you in the basement child?

05:24:50.400 --> 05:24:53.400
I'm getting weirded out.

05:24:53.400 --> 05:24:55.400
Leave me alone!

05:24:55.400 --> 05:24:57.400
Get away!

05:24:57.400 --> 05:24:59.400
Creepy wee thing, honestly.

05:25:03.400 --> 05:25:05.400
And you sing Flare of Scotland?

05:25:05.400 --> 05:25:07.400
No, I have to be hate music.

05:25:07.400 --> 05:25:09.400
I'm not singing, I'm getting drunk and going

05:25:09.400 --> 05:25:13.400
Oh, Flare of Scotland

05:25:13.400 --> 05:25:20.400
When will we see our life again?

05:25:25.400 --> 05:25:30.400
I don't know why national songs insist on going so high.

05:25:30.400 --> 05:25:34.400
Can't you just give me one song

05:25:34.400 --> 05:25:38.400
where the decibels, the notes in it

05:25:38.400 --> 05:25:40.400
are just really common

05:25:40.400 --> 05:25:42.400
and everyone can sing it.

05:25:42.400 --> 05:25:45.400
Donald, where are your choosers?

05:25:45.400 --> 05:25:46.400
What's that song?

05:25:46.400 --> 05:25:48.400
I think I've ever heard of it.

05:25:48.400 --> 05:25:50.400
I missed beer whilst I was grabbing a drink.

05:25:50.400 --> 05:25:53.400
No, no, no, we're going to do drunk membership thingy.

05:25:56.400 --> 05:25:58.400
Back to where I am.

05:25:58.400 --> 05:26:01.400
I'll take my poops in.

05:26:01.400 --> 05:26:04.400
I'm ready, let's go.

05:26:04.400 --> 05:26:09.400
I was going to force us to sing Christmas carols on Christmas.

05:26:09.400 --> 05:26:13.400
I like a wee and a manger.

05:26:13.400 --> 05:26:17.400
A wee and a manger.

05:26:17.400 --> 05:26:20.400
No crib for a pit.

05:26:20.400 --> 05:26:22.400
Why does it go so high pitch?

05:26:22.400 --> 05:26:24.400
Why can't they not just have a song

05:26:24.400 --> 05:26:25.400
down here?

05:26:25.400 --> 05:26:28.400
No crib for a bed.

05:26:28.400 --> 05:26:35.400
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.

05:26:35.400 --> 05:26:42.400
The cattle are lowing.

05:26:42.400 --> 05:26:45.400
I was going to force you guys to do

05:26:45.400 --> 05:26:47.400
freaking Christmas songs with me

05:26:47.400 --> 05:26:50.400
and then we watch Lord of the Rings on Christmas.

05:26:51.400 --> 05:26:54.400
Where the winds blow high,

05:26:54.400 --> 05:26:56.400
where the winds blow to the streets

05:26:56.400 --> 05:26:58.400
and my cattle go.

05:26:58.400 --> 05:27:00.400
Although as you say hello Donald,

05:27:00.400 --> 05:27:02.400
what the freak, I've never heard that.

05:27:02.400 --> 05:27:04.400
Do you have titsangles?

05:27:04.400 --> 05:27:06.400
Do they wobble to the floor?

05:27:08.400 --> 05:27:11.400
I can't say that, I'm sorry.

05:27:11.400 --> 05:27:14.400
I'm getting a bit delirious, hold on a minute.

05:27:16.400 --> 05:27:18.400
You've never heard that song before.

05:27:19.400 --> 05:27:25.400
Do they go to and fro?

05:27:25.400 --> 05:27:27.400
She's not even drunk yet.

05:27:27.400 --> 05:27:29.400
Just talking about alcohol is getting me steaming.

05:27:29.400 --> 05:27:31.400
It's making me lose the plot.

05:27:31.400 --> 05:27:33.400
No, it can't be.

05:27:33.400 --> 05:27:35.400
No, it can't be.

05:27:35.400 --> 05:27:37.400
What's that mean?

05:27:37.400 --> 05:27:39.400
He quoted the main.

05:27:39.400 --> 05:27:41.400
The floor?

05:27:41.400 --> 05:27:43.400
Yeah, it's a bit dirty, we're currently in the sewers.

05:27:45.400 --> 05:27:47.400
Do they wobble to the floor?

05:27:48.400 --> 05:27:50.400
Can you tie them in the knot?

05:27:50.400 --> 05:27:52.400
Can you tie them in a bow?

05:27:54.400 --> 05:27:57.400
My kami oshi hates Mongolian throat singing.

05:27:57.400 --> 05:28:00.400
It's because cats don't like the sound of the vibration

05:28:00.400 --> 05:28:02.400
that Mongolian throat singing provides.

05:28:02.400 --> 05:28:06.400
So thus I don't like it, I don't like vibrations.

05:28:06.400 --> 05:28:08.400
That rrrrrrr.

05:28:08.400 --> 05:28:09.400
No, bad.

05:28:09.400 --> 05:28:12.400
Cats don't like it, it makes their ears go back.

05:28:12.400 --> 05:28:14.400
So it makes my ears go back.

05:28:15.400 --> 05:28:18.400
World's greatest thieves live in a sewer.

05:28:18.400 --> 05:28:20.400
Down in the sewer.

05:28:22.400 --> 05:28:25.400
Ever listen to the nasty shrank, please?

05:28:28.400 --> 05:28:30.400
Let's go.

05:28:30.400 --> 05:28:32.400
The memer is starting to break free.

05:28:32.400 --> 05:28:35.400
I want to break free.

05:28:36.400 --> 05:28:38.400
My cat likes it.

05:28:38.400 --> 05:28:41.400
Your cat does not like Mongolian throat singing

05:28:41.400 --> 05:28:43.400
and I will not be taking any further statements.

05:28:43.400 --> 05:28:47.400
I assure you, your cat does not like Mongolian throat singing.

05:28:48.400 --> 05:28:51.400
Beast cat, absolutely not.

05:28:51.400 --> 05:28:53.400
Are you sure about that?

05:28:53.400 --> 05:28:57.400
Rip project women OST fans and shambles due to the Mongolian throat singing.

05:29:03.400 --> 05:29:05.400
I was so hard to sing that.

05:29:05.400 --> 05:29:08.400
Any song is hard to sing, my voice is so frazzled.

05:29:13.400 --> 05:29:18.400
Can I meet my life away?

05:29:18.400 --> 05:29:21.400
Sorry, the thieves gold are now just revealing

05:29:21.400 --> 05:29:23.400
that Mercer has betrayed them for many years

05:29:23.400 --> 05:29:26.400
and there's not a penny left for them.

05:29:26.400 --> 05:29:34.400
Meet my life away.

05:29:34.400 --> 05:29:37.400
Why is Caravans a frog in the stream?

05:29:37.400 --> 05:29:39.400
Caravans a frog here.

05:29:39.400 --> 05:29:42.400
I would like to do some karaoke.

05:29:43.400 --> 05:29:45.400
Sing your cover live.

05:29:45.400 --> 05:29:48.400
He also like rock music.

05:29:48.400 --> 05:29:51.400
We doubt you don't like vibrations.

05:29:51.400 --> 05:29:53.400
I've got an even funner fact.

05:29:55.400 --> 05:29:57.400
I only like it.

05:29:57.400 --> 05:29:59.400
Before I help you track Mercer now,

05:29:59.400 --> 05:30:02.400
I need to know what you learned from Carlya.

05:30:02.400 --> 05:30:06.400
Mercer killed Gallus, not Carlya.

05:30:06.400 --> 05:30:09.400
Gallus, Carlya and Mercer were nightingales.

05:30:09.400 --> 05:30:11.400
Was there anything else she told you?

05:30:11.400 --> 05:30:13.400
I was behind Golden Glow and Honeybrew.

05:30:13.400 --> 05:30:15.400
Was there anything else?

05:30:15.400 --> 05:30:16.400
Say it.

05:30:16.400 --> 05:30:18.400
I need you to break into my...

05:30:18.400 --> 05:30:21.400
The magic button cannot handle the vibration.

05:30:21.400 --> 05:30:23.400
Be careful, just find a way in.

05:30:23.400 --> 05:30:25.400
But the dark road home can.

05:30:25.400 --> 05:30:28.400
You have permission to kill anyone that stands in your way.

05:30:28.400 --> 05:30:29.400
Oh, I have permission.

05:30:29.400 --> 05:30:31.400
Okay, infiltrate Mercer's home.

05:30:31.400 --> 05:30:33.400
Oh, everyone's on alert.

05:30:33.400 --> 05:30:36.400
Alert, alert, Mercer.

05:30:36.400 --> 05:30:38.400
Alert, alert.

05:30:38.400 --> 05:30:40.400
All are welcome at the Temple of Mora.

05:30:40.400 --> 05:30:42.400
Ah, there we are, but you shouldn't be here.

05:30:44.400 --> 05:30:46.400
I don't doubt for one second.

05:30:46.400 --> 05:30:48.400
I won't remember that.

05:30:48.400 --> 05:30:50.400
Please continue.

05:30:50.400 --> 05:30:52.400
Information stored and saved.

05:30:52.400 --> 05:30:53.400
Yee...

05:30:53.400 --> 05:30:55.400
Literally...

05:30:55.400 --> 05:30:57.400
There's no doubt about it.

05:30:57.400 --> 05:30:59.400
The tales gilded back.

05:30:59.400 --> 05:31:01.400
I didn't realize how...

05:31:01.400 --> 05:31:05.400
Fake speedish that all the voice actors' accents try to mimic.

05:31:05.400 --> 05:31:07.400
It's actually quite jarring.

05:31:07.400 --> 05:31:09.400
Be careful.

05:31:09.400 --> 05:31:11.400
What are you talking about?

05:31:11.400 --> 05:31:12.400
Hello?

05:31:12.400 --> 05:31:13.400
Hello?

05:31:13.400 --> 05:31:16.400
This is Mercer Frey's place and he don't like visitors.

05:31:16.400 --> 05:31:17.400
Now go away.

05:31:17.400 --> 05:31:19.400
I need to get inside Mercer's house, please.

05:31:19.400 --> 05:31:21.400
No visitors, no way.

05:31:21.400 --> 05:31:23.400
Now piss off before you make me mad.

05:31:24.400 --> 05:31:27.400
I'll make it worth your while.

05:31:27.400 --> 05:31:30.400
You ain't got enough coin to make my problems go away.

05:31:30.400 --> 05:31:33.400
Unless you can talk to Maven Blackbriar and to let me out of my debt.

05:31:33.400 --> 05:31:34.400
Okay.

05:31:34.400 --> 05:31:37.400
You try and set one foot in this yard and I'll cut it off.

05:31:37.400 --> 05:31:38.400
Fine.

05:31:38.400 --> 05:31:40.400
I'll go talk to Maven about big...

05:31:40.400 --> 05:31:42.400
Big...

05:31:42.400 --> 05:31:43.400
Big stinky...

05:31:43.400 --> 05:31:44.400
What's your name?

05:31:44.400 --> 05:31:45.400
Bald?

05:31:45.400 --> 05:31:46.400
More like...

05:31:49.400 --> 05:31:50.400
Cold.

05:31:50.400 --> 05:31:53.400
Because it's freezing outside and you're not wearing any outfit.

05:31:53.400 --> 05:31:54.400
Oh!

05:31:54.400 --> 05:31:56.400
Absolutely rolled and decked.

05:31:56.400 --> 05:31:57.400
Hello?

05:31:57.400 --> 05:31:59.400
America, hiya.

05:32:00.400 --> 05:32:01.400
No, no, no.

05:32:01.400 --> 05:32:02.400
American?

05:32:03.400 --> 05:32:05.400
When's Azura's birthday?

05:32:05.400 --> 05:32:08.400
I believe it's the 23rd of August if I'm not mistaken.

05:32:15.400 --> 05:32:16.400
Is she not up?

05:32:16.400 --> 05:32:17.400
Where is she?

05:32:21.400 --> 05:32:22.400
He less of a shite.

05:32:22.400 --> 05:32:24.400
Where's Maria?

05:32:24.400 --> 05:32:25.400
Big Maria.

05:32:27.400 --> 05:32:28.400
Okay, hold on.

05:32:28.400 --> 05:32:30.400
If I put that on, it should show me where she is.

05:32:30.400 --> 05:32:31.400
Oh, she is here.

05:32:31.400 --> 05:32:33.400
You were there all along.

05:32:43.400 --> 05:32:46.400
Sam, if you don't want any of it, I'll take a bell for you.

05:32:47.400 --> 05:32:48.400
What did he do?

05:32:53.400 --> 05:32:55.400
Do you think Mercer...

05:32:55.400 --> 05:32:56.400
Is a cl-

05:32:56.400 --> 05:32:57.400
What?

05:33:00.400 --> 05:33:02.400
He's in debt because of a quill?

05:33:14.400 --> 05:33:17.400
Is this his quill that's in the freaking lake?

05:33:18.400 --> 05:33:20.400
I believe it.

05:33:25.400 --> 05:33:26.400
Oh, no.

05:33:28.400 --> 05:33:31.400
I think it might just be easier to perish this man.

05:33:33.400 --> 05:33:35.400
I think it's in a boat.

05:33:35.400 --> 05:33:38.400
Oh, goodness me, it's been many a year.

05:33:38.400 --> 05:33:40.400
I think it's in a boat.

05:33:40.400 --> 05:33:42.400
I'm gonna have to look at it on the HUD.

05:33:42.400 --> 05:33:43.400
Hold on.

05:33:43.400 --> 05:33:49.400
I want to say it's like somewhere here to the left.

05:33:51.400 --> 05:33:55.400
Oh, I could be terribly wrong though, but there should be a boat.

05:33:56.400 --> 05:33:57.400
It started.

05:34:08.400 --> 05:34:10.400
It's at the bottom of the lake somewhere.

05:34:10.400 --> 05:34:11.400
Thank you for your help.

05:34:11.400 --> 05:34:13.400
I really appreciate that.

05:34:13.400 --> 05:34:16.400
I am somewhere at the bottom of the lake.

05:34:16.400 --> 05:34:18.400
I don't even have water breathing either.

05:34:18.400 --> 05:34:19.400
I can't believe you.

05:34:19.400 --> 05:34:21.400
You had the audacity to take that out.

05:34:21.400 --> 05:34:23.400
You're just trying to upset me.

05:34:23.400 --> 05:34:25.400
What's this?

05:34:25.400 --> 05:34:27.400
What's that barnacles?

05:34:34.400 --> 05:34:35.400
Wait, wait, wait.

05:34:35.400 --> 05:34:36.400
Is this a hint?

05:34:36.400 --> 05:34:37.400
Hold on, let me breathe.

05:34:37.400 --> 05:34:40.400
Is this a hint that maybe you're around here somewhere?

05:34:42.400 --> 05:34:43.400
Hold on.

05:34:43.400 --> 05:34:44.400
Right, should we?

05:34:44.400 --> 05:34:45.400
Oh, no.

05:34:45.400 --> 05:34:48.400
Right, well, there was a box, but I guess not.

05:34:48.400 --> 05:34:49.400
There's rocks here.

05:34:49.400 --> 05:34:52.400
Is that telling me it's here somewhere?

05:34:52.400 --> 05:34:54.400
But the barnacles, there's more barnacles.

05:34:54.400 --> 05:34:57.400
Oh, can you say render distance, please?

05:34:57.400 --> 05:34:58.400
Stronius, under the water.

05:34:58.400 --> 05:35:00.400
You don't want reflins.

05:35:02.400 --> 05:35:04.400
Ah, let me breathe.

05:35:05.400 --> 05:35:07.400
I seem to think it's like the left side.

05:35:07.400 --> 05:35:09.400
I saw that storage box.

05:35:09.400 --> 05:35:11.400
I think that's the game being like hint.

05:35:11.400 --> 05:35:12.400
It's over here.

05:35:14.400 --> 05:35:15.400
Okay, hold on.

05:35:15.400 --> 05:35:17.400
Let me just check again.

05:35:17.400 --> 05:35:20.400
I think it's in a broken boat.

05:35:20.400 --> 05:35:23.400
Um, it's on the map somewhere.

05:35:23.400 --> 05:35:25.400
Right, I'm not reading chat for the next minute.

05:35:25.400 --> 05:35:27.400
You're on time out.

05:35:27.400 --> 05:35:29.400
You're done.

05:35:29.400 --> 05:35:32.400
I seem to think it's close to the edge of the water.

05:35:32.400 --> 05:35:34.400
Wait, this is a bit too close, clearly.

05:35:34.400 --> 05:35:35.400
By the bridge?

05:35:35.400 --> 05:35:38.400
I don't recall it being by a bridge, to be honest.

05:35:42.400 --> 05:35:44.400
You know what, reflin?

05:35:44.400 --> 05:35:45.400
What?

05:35:47.400 --> 05:35:48.400
A strong name.

05:35:48.400 --> 05:35:50.400
What do you think of the Indiana Jones game?

05:35:50.400 --> 05:35:52.400
I didn't know there was a new one.

05:35:54.400 --> 05:35:55.400
Oh, for goodness' sake.

05:35:55.400 --> 05:35:57.400
I think I'm off the mark.

05:35:57.400 --> 05:35:58.400
Where am I?

05:35:59.400 --> 05:36:03.400
Maybe it's like down here a bit.

05:36:03.400 --> 05:36:05.400
This is the entire area.

05:36:05.400 --> 05:36:08.400
Okay, I'm just going to do one big loop around the island.

05:36:08.400 --> 05:36:10.400
Why is there so many salmon?

05:36:10.400 --> 05:36:12.400
Shoney, I love you.

05:36:12.400 --> 05:36:13.400
Don't hate my friends.

05:36:13.400 --> 05:36:15.400
Wait, why would I hate your friends?

05:36:15.400 --> 05:36:17.400
I thought you weren't looking at us.

05:36:17.400 --> 05:36:19.400
Look, I forgive really easily.

05:36:19.400 --> 05:36:20.400
Oh, no, get up!

05:36:20.400 --> 05:36:22.400
Shabee, what are you doing?

05:36:22.400 --> 05:36:24.400
Underwater burning.

05:36:24.400 --> 05:36:27.400
Okay, I don't...

05:36:27.400 --> 05:36:29.400
think it's up this way.

05:36:29.400 --> 05:36:32.400
But we're going to just do a big circle

05:36:32.400 --> 05:36:35.400
for the sake of satisfying myself.

05:36:39.400 --> 05:36:42.400
Come up for water often.

05:36:44.400 --> 05:36:46.400
Reflins, remember that Shoney's much of an...

05:36:46.400 --> 05:36:49.400
as much of an addict as we are.

05:36:50.400 --> 05:36:52.400
Scuba, Shabee.

05:36:54.400 --> 05:36:56.400
Shabee, making me nervous.

05:36:58.400 --> 05:36:59.400
Oh, wait.

05:36:59.400 --> 05:37:00.400
Maybe I'm on one of these islands.

05:37:00.400 --> 05:37:02.400
I may be rocked up on a baby island.

05:37:02.400 --> 05:37:03.400
Do you know that?

05:37:03.400 --> 05:37:04.400
What the heck was that?

05:37:04.400 --> 05:37:05.400
I'm rabbit.

05:37:07.400 --> 05:37:08.400
Hold on.

05:37:08.400 --> 05:37:10.400
Let's just check the hut again.

05:37:10.400 --> 05:37:12.400
We're kind of at the furthest point

05:37:12.400 --> 05:37:14.400
of this section of the lake.

05:37:14.400 --> 05:37:17.400
I'm not really wanting to go too much further.

05:37:18.400 --> 05:37:20.400
It's near the box you found before.

05:37:20.400 --> 05:37:22.400
Oh, my God, I'm actually getting my hand held.

05:37:22.400 --> 05:37:23.400
See, thank you, refling.

05:37:23.400 --> 05:37:24.400
I actually get my hand held.

05:37:24.400 --> 05:37:26.400
And you're just freaking back there.

05:37:27.400 --> 05:37:29.400
I've gone way off course.

05:37:31.400 --> 05:37:33.400
Oh, my God, forgive me.

05:37:33.400 --> 05:37:35.400
Fucking nonchalant.

05:37:37.400 --> 05:37:40.400
It's between the big island and Riften.

05:37:40.400 --> 05:37:41.400
That's it.

05:37:41.400 --> 05:37:42.400
I'm giving in.

05:37:42.400 --> 05:37:43.400
Skyrimmer's been installed.

05:37:43.400 --> 05:37:44.400
Are you happy now?

05:37:44.400 --> 05:37:46.400
Oh, have I put you in the Skyrim mid?

05:37:46.400 --> 05:37:47.400
Yippee!

05:37:48.400 --> 05:37:49.400
I can't help the sarcasm.

05:37:49.400 --> 05:37:50.400
I forget where the thing is every time.

05:37:50.400 --> 05:37:52.400
In waste half an hour looking also.

05:37:52.400 --> 05:37:54.400
It's underwater, not on an island.

05:37:55.400 --> 05:37:57.400
Yeah, it's like crashed off of it.

05:37:58.400 --> 05:38:00.400
My eyes are currently burning,

05:38:00.400 --> 05:38:02.400
opening under the salt water.

05:38:04.400 --> 05:38:05.400
Right.

05:38:06.400 --> 05:38:07.400
That's not it.

05:38:07.400 --> 05:38:09.400
These are just textures.

05:38:10.400 --> 05:38:11.400
It's not like this.

05:38:11.400 --> 05:38:13.400
I can't even swim in.

05:38:14.400 --> 05:38:16.400
So there's no point.

05:38:17.400 --> 05:38:19.400
I'm gonna go buy that box again.

05:38:19.400 --> 05:38:21.400
If I could find the box again.

05:38:23.400 --> 05:38:25.400
We'll float to the right this time,

05:38:25.400 --> 05:38:28.400
not to be confused with the hit TV game.

05:38:28.400 --> 05:38:29.400
A little to the left.

05:38:29.400 --> 05:38:31.400
I don't know why I said TV game.

05:38:32.400 --> 05:38:33.400
Steam game.

05:38:37.400 --> 05:38:39.400
So those are the barnacles.

05:38:42.400 --> 05:38:43.400
I'm getting swept up.

05:38:44.400 --> 05:38:46.400
We're trying to find the quill.

05:38:47.400 --> 05:38:48.400
That maven.

05:38:50.400 --> 05:38:53.400
I did not realise how rubbish this game is.

05:38:54.400 --> 05:38:55.400
Is this for real?

05:38:55.400 --> 05:38:58.400
There's like two floating foxes under the cave.

05:38:59.400 --> 05:39:00.400
What's going on here?

05:39:02.400 --> 05:39:04.400
I can see loads of broken stuff.

05:39:05.400 --> 05:39:07.400
Hold on, let me breathe again.

05:39:10.400 --> 05:39:11.400
Right.

05:39:12.400 --> 05:39:14.400
Definitely not searchable.

05:39:15.400 --> 05:39:19.400
There's loads of boxes just hanging off the dock.

05:39:22.400 --> 05:39:23.400
It just works.

05:39:23.400 --> 05:39:26.400
I think you may have floated over it.

05:39:26.400 --> 05:39:28.400
It's not by the docks.

05:39:30.400 --> 05:39:32.400
I like the detail though,

05:39:32.400 --> 05:39:34.400
the concept that it fell off the boat

05:39:34.400 --> 05:39:36.400
and they can't retrieve it.

05:39:36.400 --> 05:39:37.400
That's quite smart.

05:39:45.400 --> 05:39:47.400
This is where I'm on the map.

05:39:48.400 --> 05:39:50.400
I'm like messing around here.

05:39:52.400 --> 05:39:54.400
Isn't this rock formation maybe?

05:39:56.400 --> 05:39:57.400
What the barnacles?

05:39:58.400 --> 05:40:00.400
Hold on, let me breathe.

05:40:00.400 --> 05:40:03.400
I'm like right, I'm like freaking, I'm here.

05:40:03.400 --> 05:40:05.400
I doubt it got dropped here.

05:40:05.400 --> 05:40:07.400
It just seems so unlikely.

05:40:07.400 --> 05:40:10.400
Go straight from the docks towards the island.

05:40:12.400 --> 05:40:13.400
Okay.

05:40:15.400 --> 05:40:16.400
Hmm.

05:40:22.400 --> 05:40:24.400
I'm searching, I'm searching.

05:40:24.400 --> 05:40:26.400
There's salmon, there's salmon,

05:40:26.400 --> 05:40:28.400
there's bulks, there's bulks,

05:40:28.400 --> 05:40:31.400
but it's more towards here.

05:40:33.400 --> 05:40:35.400
Don't need to breathe, hold on.

05:40:37.400 --> 05:40:38.400
Okay.

05:40:41.400 --> 05:40:42.400
Okay, this is new.

05:40:42.400 --> 05:40:44.400
I don't think I've investigated this.

05:40:45.400 --> 05:40:46.400
Maybe we have.

05:40:50.400 --> 05:40:52.400
They have a freaking potion of water breathing

05:40:52.400 --> 05:40:54.400
that would make this a lot either.

05:40:56.400 --> 05:40:57.400
Water breathing where?

05:40:57.400 --> 05:40:59.400
Water breathing.

05:40:59.400 --> 05:41:01.400
Oh, a whole 15 seconds.

05:41:01.400 --> 05:41:03.400
Oh, you're too kind, you're too kind.

05:41:07.400 --> 05:41:08.400
Oh!

05:41:08.400 --> 05:41:10.400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

05:41:10.400 --> 05:41:13.400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, fucking.

05:41:17.400 --> 05:41:19.400
Oh, oh, oh, I'm getting current.

05:41:19.400 --> 05:41:21.400
I'm getting drafted away by the current.

05:41:21.400 --> 05:41:23.400
Okay, fuck that.

05:41:23.400 --> 05:41:24.400
Alright, I was doing the new one.

05:41:24.400 --> 05:41:26.400
Stop, current, stop, I can't breathe.

05:41:31.400 --> 05:41:32.400
Oh.

05:41:40.400 --> 05:41:41.400
Ah!

05:41:41.400 --> 05:41:44.400
I've only got 10 lock picks.

05:41:44.400 --> 05:41:45.400
Going to be easy on me.

05:41:45.400 --> 05:41:47.400
I'm going to need to bow some more.

05:41:48.400 --> 05:41:49.400
No!

05:41:50.400 --> 05:41:51.400
Less?

05:41:54.400 --> 05:41:55.400
I'm like...

05:41:58.400 --> 05:42:00.400
Is that less or is that more?

05:42:03.400 --> 05:42:04.400
Oh.

05:42:05.400 --> 05:42:06.400
Give me that.

05:42:06.400 --> 05:42:08.400
Stupid bastard.

05:42:08.400 --> 05:42:09.400
Bastard, you're a quill.

05:42:09.400 --> 05:42:10.400
Right.

05:42:10.400 --> 05:42:11.400
We did it.

05:42:11.400 --> 05:42:12.400
Oh my god, that took well.

05:42:14.400 --> 05:42:17.400
Just get Vol-song and forget about that.

05:42:17.400 --> 05:42:19.400
What's Vol-song?

05:42:20.400 --> 05:42:21.400
She's got it.

05:42:21.400 --> 05:42:23.400
If she can open the box, literally.

05:42:23.400 --> 05:42:24.400
What's inside the box?

05:42:24.400 --> 05:42:26.400
That's a freaking quill.

05:42:27.400 --> 05:42:28.400
You did it.

05:42:28.400 --> 05:42:30.400
You're the first person in history to buy lock picks.

05:42:30.400 --> 05:42:31.400
They're so common.

05:42:31.400 --> 05:42:33.400
I know, I keep forgetting to feel like glue.

05:42:33.400 --> 05:42:34.400
Hi, do you want a quill?

05:42:34.400 --> 05:42:37.400
I presume you're bothering me for a good reason.

05:42:37.400 --> 05:42:38.400
I've found the quill.

05:42:38.400 --> 05:42:39.400
Really?

05:42:39.400 --> 05:42:41.400
I wrote that off a long time ago.

05:42:41.400 --> 05:42:45.400
Well, I suppose I need to fulfill my end of the bargain.

05:42:45.400 --> 05:42:46.400
Yes.

05:42:46.400 --> 05:42:47.400
Give this document to Vol.

05:42:47.400 --> 05:42:48.400
It frees him from the debt.

05:42:48.400 --> 05:42:50.400
But I never want to see him in Rifton again.

05:42:50.400 --> 05:42:51.400
Oh, okay.

05:42:51.400 --> 05:42:52.400
Oh, that's Exile.

05:42:52.400 --> 05:42:53.400
That's not very nice.

05:42:53.400 --> 05:42:55.400
He's made his pals here.

05:42:55.400 --> 05:42:57.400
Do you want to reconsider Exile on someone?

05:42:57.400 --> 05:42:59.400
That's not very nice.

05:42:59.400 --> 05:43:00.400
Have you heard of that?

05:43:00.400 --> 05:43:03.400
Have you heard how damaging that can be to someone's social life?

05:43:04.400 --> 05:43:06.400
Makes him feel like they're not a part of the community.

05:43:06.400 --> 05:43:08.400
You have to, you know, uproot and go elsewhere.

05:43:08.400 --> 05:43:09.400
Not nice.

05:43:09.400 --> 05:43:10.400
He's trying to suck it at Skyrim.

05:43:10.400 --> 05:43:11.400
I know.

05:43:13.400 --> 05:43:15.400
You, come here.

05:43:15.400 --> 05:43:17.400
I can't talk to him yet or he'll be aggressive.

05:43:17.400 --> 05:43:19.400
Like, you.

05:43:23.400 --> 05:43:25.400
Here, over here.

05:43:25.400 --> 05:43:26.400
What?

05:43:26.400 --> 05:43:27.400
What?

05:43:28.400 --> 05:43:29.400
Or Big Vault.

05:43:29.400 --> 05:43:30.400
Sorry, Big Vault.

05:43:30.400 --> 05:43:31.400
Oh, oh, he's going to that gate.

05:43:31.400 --> 05:43:32.400
Hold on.

05:43:32.400 --> 05:43:34.400
If we're fast enough, if we're fast enough, we can go.

05:43:34.400 --> 05:43:37.400
We can go talk to him on the other side of that gate.

05:43:37.400 --> 05:43:38.400
Vault.

05:43:38.400 --> 05:43:39.400
Vault, hold on.

05:43:39.400 --> 05:43:40.400
Vault.

05:43:40.400 --> 05:43:41.400
Vault, it's me.

05:43:41.400 --> 05:43:42.400
It's me.

05:43:42.400 --> 05:43:43.400
No, no, no.

05:43:43.400 --> 05:43:44.400
He's come back to the original position.

05:43:44.400 --> 05:43:46.400
No, Vault, no.

05:43:46.400 --> 05:43:47.400
Wait, Vault, wait.

05:43:47.400 --> 05:43:48.400
Let me talk to you.

05:43:48.400 --> 05:43:49.400
I just want to talk to you.

05:43:49.400 --> 05:43:50.400
I just want to talk to you.

05:43:50.400 --> 05:43:51.400
I just want to talk to you.

05:43:51.400 --> 05:43:52.400
I just want to talk to you.

05:43:52.400 --> 05:43:53.400
I just want to talk to you.

05:43:53.400 --> 05:43:54.400
Vault.

05:43:54.400 --> 05:43:55.400
Vault.

05:43:55.400 --> 05:43:56.400
Oh.

05:43:56.400 --> 05:43:57.400
I have something for you.

05:43:58.400 --> 05:44:00.400
Here, it's your debt with Maven.

05:44:00.400 --> 05:44:01.400
You're free.

05:44:13.400 --> 05:44:14.400
What are you doing?

05:44:14.400 --> 05:44:15.400
How's he added?

05:44:15.400 --> 05:44:17.400
Are you just coming out now?

05:44:17.400 --> 05:44:19.400
Oh, he is.

05:44:19.400 --> 05:44:20.400
Oh.

05:44:22.400 --> 05:44:23.400
Okay, thank you.

05:44:23.400 --> 05:44:25.400
Thank you very much.

05:44:25.400 --> 05:44:27.400
Can I just come in this way?

05:44:27.400 --> 05:44:28.400
Oh, it's barred.

05:44:28.400 --> 05:44:29.400
Wait.

05:44:29.400 --> 05:44:31.400
I need a bow and arrow.

05:44:31.400 --> 05:44:33.400
Or can I just hit this?

05:44:35.400 --> 05:44:36.400
Okay.

05:44:36.400 --> 05:44:38.400
No, you need a bow and arrow.

05:44:38.400 --> 05:44:40.400
I was being a bit...

05:44:40.400 --> 05:44:42.400
Let me just...

05:44:46.400 --> 05:44:47.400
Tada.

05:44:48.400 --> 05:44:50.400
That's how you get the ramp down.

05:44:50.400 --> 05:44:51.400
Super fuss.

05:44:51.400 --> 05:44:53.400
He's skipping town, no reason.

05:44:56.400 --> 05:44:57.400
Hmm.

05:44:59.400 --> 05:45:02.400
I just subbed to all the girls account.

05:45:02.400 --> 05:45:03.400
Heck, you did.

05:45:03.400 --> 05:45:06.400
We love supporting genmates out here.

05:45:09.400 --> 05:45:12.400
Oh, Delinia, you animal.

05:45:12.400 --> 05:45:14.400
Literally finishing off the kill.

05:45:14.400 --> 05:45:17.400
She said, nah, I want to be the reason

05:45:17.400 --> 05:45:20.400
for death on the death certificate.

05:45:20.400 --> 05:45:22.400
Jeez, Louise girl.

05:45:23.400 --> 05:45:26.400
The bar is locked in place and cannot be opened.

05:45:26.400 --> 05:45:27.400
Okay.

05:45:27.400 --> 05:45:29.400
Uh, any money?

05:45:29.400 --> 05:45:31.400
Garnet, I'll take you.

05:45:31.400 --> 05:45:33.400
I can sell it for...

05:45:33.400 --> 05:45:34.400
some money.

05:45:34.400 --> 05:45:36.400
Statue of Debala, how about that?

05:45:36.400 --> 05:45:37.400
Can I move that one?

05:45:37.400 --> 05:45:38.400
Nope, can't move that one either.

05:45:38.400 --> 05:45:40.400
Okay, um, I'll just stop touching things

05:45:40.400 --> 05:45:42.400
in this house then, I guess.

05:45:42.400 --> 05:45:44.400
I guess I'll go F myself.

05:45:44.400 --> 05:45:45.400
Wait.

05:45:45.400 --> 05:45:46.400
What?

05:45:46.400 --> 05:45:48.400
This isn't the end.

05:45:48.400 --> 05:45:49.400
Hold on.

05:45:53.400 --> 05:45:55.400
Right here?

05:45:55.400 --> 05:45:57.400
Ah, um, yeah.

05:45:57.400 --> 05:45:59.400
Wait, I'm not touching anything else.

05:45:59.400 --> 05:46:02.400
Suspicious clothes.

05:46:02.400 --> 05:46:04.400
Honestly, I wouldn't have figured that out more.

05:46:04.400 --> 05:46:06.400
Ah, if the game didn't help.

05:46:06.400 --> 05:46:08.400
Little cheeky alien potion.

05:46:08.400 --> 05:46:09.400
Oh.

05:46:09.400 --> 05:46:11.400
Oh, what's this?

05:46:11.400 --> 05:46:13.400
Oh, I have no idea what this is.

05:46:13.400 --> 05:46:14.400
That looks like a trap.

05:46:14.400 --> 05:46:17.400
Lydia, Lydia, Lydia, stop standing on stuff, Lydia.

05:46:17.400 --> 05:46:19.400
Lydia, Lydia.

05:46:20.400 --> 05:46:22.400
Oh, I'm getting sliced in days.

05:46:22.400 --> 05:46:23.400
Hold on.

05:46:23.400 --> 05:46:24.400
Oh.

05:46:24.400 --> 05:46:28.400
I'm getting absolutely chopped up.

05:46:28.400 --> 05:46:30.400
Oh, and there's poison darts.

05:46:30.400 --> 05:46:31.400
Mine.

05:46:31.400 --> 05:46:32.400
Goodness.

05:46:32.400 --> 05:46:34.400
You need to relax.

05:46:34.400 --> 05:46:35.400
Oh, my God.

05:46:35.400 --> 05:46:36.400
Mine.

05:46:37.400 --> 05:46:38.400
Okay, I've got that.

05:46:38.400 --> 05:46:39.400
What's this?

05:46:39.400 --> 05:46:40.400
Eh.

05:46:41.400 --> 05:46:43.400
What even?

05:46:43.400 --> 05:46:44.400
Why is this book?

05:46:44.400 --> 05:46:45.400
I have curiosity.

05:46:45.400 --> 05:46:47.400
What's the contents of this book?

05:46:47.400 --> 05:46:49.400
I've never actually read it.

05:46:53.400 --> 05:46:55.400
Lift her tail.

05:46:55.400 --> 05:46:56.400
Certainly not, kind sir.

05:46:56.400 --> 05:46:58.400
I am here to clean your chambers.

05:46:58.400 --> 05:47:00.400
Is that all you have come...

05:47:00.400 --> 05:47:02.400
Is that all you have come here for?

05:47:02.400 --> 05:47:04.400
Little one, my chambers.

05:47:04.400 --> 05:47:06.400
I have no idea what is you, implying master.

05:47:06.400 --> 05:47:08.400
I am but a poor Argonian maid.

05:47:08.400 --> 05:47:09.400
Bro, what?

05:47:09.400 --> 05:47:11.400
So you are my dumpling.

05:47:11.400 --> 05:47:12.400
And a good one at that.

05:47:12.400 --> 05:47:14.400
Such strong legs and shapely tail.

05:47:14.400 --> 05:47:15.400
You embarrass me, sir.

05:47:15.400 --> 05:47:17.400
Fear not, you are safe with me.

05:47:17.400 --> 05:47:19.400
I must finish my cleaning, sir.

05:47:19.400 --> 05:47:21.400
The mistress will have my head if I do not.

05:47:21.400 --> 05:47:22.400
Cleaning, eh?

05:47:22.400 --> 05:47:24.400
I have something for you right here.

05:47:24.400 --> 05:47:27.400
Polish my spear.

05:47:27.400 --> 05:47:28.400
But it is huge.

05:47:28.400 --> 05:47:30.400
It could take me all night.

05:47:30.400 --> 05:47:31.400
Plenty of time.

05:47:31.400 --> 05:47:33.400
My sweet plenty.

05:47:34.400 --> 05:47:37.400
I've never fricking read that.

05:47:38.400 --> 05:47:39.400
Oh, my God.

05:47:39.400 --> 05:47:41.400
That's hilarious.

05:47:42.400 --> 05:47:43.400
Many thanks.

05:47:43.400 --> 05:47:47.400
Not certain how you managed to get your hands on this item we discussed,

05:47:47.400 --> 05:47:48.400
but I'm more than pleased.

05:47:48.400 --> 05:47:52.400
I thought you'd simply wait until transported to Castle Devorah

05:47:52.400 --> 05:47:53.400
to its final destination,

05:47:53.400 --> 05:47:54.400
but according to what I've heard,

05:47:54.400 --> 05:47:56.400
it vanished right from their armory.

05:47:56.400 --> 05:47:58.400
I wish I knew how you were able to slip by the guards,

05:47:58.400 --> 05:48:01.400
bypass the porticolas,

05:48:01.400 --> 05:48:05.400
unlock the armory door and break in at the door of a puzzle locked chest.

05:48:05.400 --> 05:48:07.400
You need to teach me that little trick sometime.

05:48:07.400 --> 05:48:09.400
I've left your cut in the usual drop spot

05:48:09.400 --> 05:48:11.400
and might have another drop where you soon are.

05:48:13.400 --> 05:48:15.400
There's three more books of it.

05:48:15.400 --> 05:48:16.400
Oh, my God.

05:48:16.400 --> 05:48:18.400
I knew the books existed.

05:48:18.400 --> 05:48:19.400
Wait, what am I doing?

05:48:20.400 --> 05:48:22.400
Egg spare.

05:48:24.400 --> 05:48:26.400
Can we do it?

05:48:30.400 --> 05:48:31.400
Okay.

05:48:32.400 --> 05:48:35.400
But we have it.

05:48:36.400 --> 05:48:38.400
Easy.

05:48:39.400 --> 05:48:40.400
Easy.

05:48:40.400 --> 05:48:42.400
Okay, a bit more, I think.

05:48:42.400 --> 05:48:44.400
Or maybe it was left, I don't know.

05:48:46.400 --> 05:48:47.400
Okay, maybe it's left.

05:48:47.400 --> 05:48:48.400
Do you know that?

05:48:49.400 --> 05:48:50.400
Easy.

05:48:53.400 --> 05:48:54.400
Easy.

05:48:54.400 --> 05:48:55.400
I'm getting nervous.

05:48:56.400 --> 05:48:57.400
Easy.

05:49:03.400 --> 05:49:04.400
Alright, we got children.

05:49:04.400 --> 05:49:05.400
I'll take children.

05:49:05.400 --> 05:49:07.400
Not a bother at all.

05:49:07.400 --> 05:49:09.400
Not a bother at all.

05:49:13.400 --> 05:49:14.400
The rat wave.

05:49:16.400 --> 05:49:17.400
Let's go.

05:49:23.400 --> 05:49:27.400
I don't remember what way to go.

05:49:27.400 --> 05:49:28.400
Is it this one?

05:49:31.400 --> 05:49:33.400
Oh, no, this is if you want Dragonborn.

05:49:33.400 --> 05:49:34.400
Oops.

05:49:35.400 --> 05:49:37.400
Can you stop attacking me?

05:49:37.400 --> 05:49:39.400
Whoa, your bull.

05:49:39.400 --> 05:49:41.400
It's an imperial bull.

05:49:41.400 --> 05:49:46.400
I think an imperial bull is better than what I've got right now.

05:49:46.400 --> 05:49:50.400
Although mine does have burn damage, so...

05:49:50.400 --> 05:49:52.400
I wish YouTube had other emotes.

05:49:52.400 --> 05:49:53.400
I know.

05:49:54.400 --> 05:49:59.400
YouTube is like very slowly catching up to the appeal of...

05:50:01.400 --> 05:50:03.400
I'm not doing any more lock picking on that now.

05:50:03.400 --> 05:50:07.400
YouTube is very slowly catching up to what the appeal of Twitch is.

05:50:07.400 --> 05:50:10.400
To the point where it is going to take over Twitch.

05:50:10.400 --> 05:50:11.400
I'm sorry.

05:50:11.400 --> 05:50:12.400
It just is.

05:50:13.400 --> 05:50:15.400
Why did I jump down?

05:50:15.400 --> 05:50:18.400
I've just added so much time to this travel.

05:50:20.400 --> 05:50:28.400
I did not recall how long it takes to place Skyrim.

05:50:29.400 --> 05:50:32.400
We're literally not even finished one questline yet.

05:50:33.400 --> 05:50:38.400
Tear him up, Lydia.

05:50:40.400 --> 05:50:42.400
Okay, there we go.

05:50:44.400 --> 05:50:45.400
Emmy's Rats.

05:50:46.400 --> 05:50:48.400
I'm so confused. Where did that come from?

05:50:48.400 --> 05:50:50.400
I dropped down there.

05:50:52.400 --> 05:50:53.400
Okay.

05:50:54.400 --> 05:50:55.400
There you go.

05:50:55.400 --> 05:50:56.400
Channel emotes soon.

05:50:56.400 --> 05:51:00.400
Channel emotes literally less than 24 hours. Have fun.

05:51:00.400 --> 05:51:03.400
Am I supposed to speak to Brineo?

05:51:03.400 --> 05:51:04.400
Okay.

05:51:04.400 --> 05:51:05.400
You know what?

05:51:05.400 --> 05:51:09.400
If I had that selected, that probably would have gone a lot faster than what I just did there.

05:51:11.400 --> 05:51:13.400
Underestimating the 1000 plus hours game.

05:51:13.400 --> 05:51:16.400
Literally, I was like, right, we'll do the Thieves Guild.

05:51:16.400 --> 05:51:17.400
We'll do Dark Brotherhood.

05:51:17.400 --> 05:51:20.400
We're literally six hours into this stream.

05:51:20.400 --> 05:51:24.400
I've less than six hours and I've not even finished Thieves.

05:51:24.400 --> 05:51:25.400
Oh, sorry.

05:51:25.400 --> 05:51:26.400
Sorry.

05:51:26.400 --> 05:51:27.400
I got a bit excited there.

05:51:27.400 --> 05:51:28.400
I apologize.

05:51:31.400 --> 05:51:32.400
Okay.

05:51:32.400 --> 05:51:33.400
Let's do that.

05:51:33.400 --> 05:51:34.400
How much?

05:51:35.400 --> 05:51:36.400
How many?

05:51:36.400 --> 05:51:37.400
How much heavy am I?

05:51:37.400 --> 05:51:38.400
Curry?

05:51:38.400 --> 05:51:40.400
Wait, it's 2.18 out of 3.30.

05:51:40.400 --> 05:51:41.400
That'll do.

05:51:41.400 --> 05:51:43.400
I need like a hundred stuff.

05:51:43.400 --> 05:51:44.400
Hi, Carlaya.

05:51:46.400 --> 05:51:47.400
How long do we have?

05:51:47.400 --> 05:51:49.400
Yeah, less than six hours because of this.

05:51:49.400 --> 05:51:50.400
Oops.

05:51:51.400 --> 05:51:52.400
I'm sorry.

05:51:52.400 --> 05:51:53.400
I'm sorry.

05:51:54.400 --> 05:51:55.400
Oops.

05:51:55.400 --> 05:51:56.400
I'm sorry.

05:51:56.400 --> 05:51:57.400
I'm sorry.

05:52:00.400 --> 05:52:01.400
No.

05:52:01.400 --> 05:52:03.400
Why is two people inviting me to talk?

05:52:03.400 --> 05:52:04.400
There's too many people.

05:52:07.400 --> 05:52:08.400
Wait.

05:52:08.400 --> 05:52:10.400
So do you do every sequel?

05:52:10.400 --> 05:52:11.400
No.

05:52:11.400 --> 05:52:14.400
I was just going to do Thieves Guild.

05:52:14.400 --> 05:52:15.400
Black.

05:52:17.400 --> 05:52:19.400
Assassins.

05:52:19.400 --> 05:52:20.400
What?

05:52:20.400 --> 05:52:21.400
That's not what they're called.

05:52:22.400 --> 05:52:24.400
The Dark Brotherhood.

05:52:25.400 --> 05:52:26.400
And then The Vampire.

05:52:26.400 --> 05:52:27.400
And then The Mean Quest.

05:52:27.400 --> 05:52:29.400
And I've done nothing yet.

05:52:29.400 --> 05:52:31.400
So I don't think it's happening.

05:52:33.400 --> 05:52:34.400
Dark Brotherhood.

05:52:34.400 --> 05:52:35.400
Yes.

05:52:37.400 --> 05:52:39.400
Hybrony of Smashes Into Wall.

05:52:44.400 --> 05:52:46.400
The Trinity of Streams on YouTube.

05:52:46.400 --> 05:52:50.400
YouTube Shorts of Recycles Clips with 10 Minutes Highlights on the same platform.

05:52:51.400 --> 05:52:54.400
And also just a cheat for exposure.

05:52:54.400 --> 05:52:56.400
Yeah, like Twitch is exposed.

05:52:56.400 --> 05:53:00.400
It's very interesting to see breakdowns on either website.

05:53:00.400 --> 05:53:03.400
Like, I've just...

05:53:03.400 --> 05:53:05.400
Meet Karlai at the Sanding Zone.

05:53:05.400 --> 05:53:07.400
Okay, we're about to become a Nightingale.

05:53:07.400 --> 05:53:09.400
I know I've literally skipped through all the dialogue.

05:53:09.400 --> 05:53:13.400
So for anyone who hasn't consumed Skyrim and is listening in at home,

05:53:13.400 --> 05:53:15.400
I apologize greatly.

05:53:15.400 --> 05:53:19.400
I can just give you the TLDR.

05:53:19.400 --> 05:53:24.400
I'm more than happy to provide such a thing for you.

05:53:24.400 --> 05:53:26.400
How the heck do I get out of this area?

05:53:30.400 --> 05:53:32.400
I'll just go out of the docks.

05:53:32.400 --> 05:53:33.400
How about that?

05:53:34.400 --> 05:53:36.400
I don't think you can jump over.

05:53:37.400 --> 05:53:40.400
If you haven't played Skyrim, go play Skyrim.

05:53:41.400 --> 05:53:42.400
Mind yourself.

05:53:42.400 --> 05:53:43.400
Mind yourself.

05:53:44.400 --> 05:53:45.400
I'd be a Rifting Guard.

05:53:45.400 --> 05:53:46.400
I'd be like, yeah.

05:53:47.400 --> 05:53:48.400
You stink.

05:53:48.400 --> 05:53:50.400
Don't be causing trouble.

05:53:53.400 --> 05:53:54.400
Ooh.

05:53:54.400 --> 05:53:55.400
Hi, Maul.

05:53:59.400 --> 05:54:01.400
Any news involving the Dark Brotherhood?

05:54:05.400 --> 05:54:06.400
Oh!

05:54:06.400 --> 05:54:07.400
That's the other...

05:54:07.400 --> 05:54:09.400
That's the Brotherhood Quest.

05:54:09.400 --> 05:54:11.400
Well, that was lucky we talked to him to get that,

05:54:11.400 --> 05:54:15.400
because we probably just have to kill Grelok the kind.

05:54:15.400 --> 05:54:18.400
And she's actually not very keen.

05:54:18.400 --> 05:54:19.400
What's this?

05:54:19.400 --> 05:54:20.400
Oh, it's a clay deposit.

05:54:23.400 --> 05:54:25.400
The Thieves Guild quest line is mostly yapping at this point.

05:54:25.400 --> 05:54:27.400
Honestly, we're about to become Nightingales,

05:54:27.400 --> 05:54:30.400
and it's about to be yap-yap-yap-yap-yap.

05:54:30.400 --> 05:54:31.400
I thought I was a good yapper.

05:54:31.400 --> 05:54:32.400
Mm-mm.

05:54:32.400 --> 05:54:34.400
Yap-yap-yap-yap-yap-yap.

05:54:34.400 --> 05:54:35.400
Hello.

05:54:35.400 --> 05:54:36.400
Hiya!

05:54:37.400 --> 05:54:38.400
I'm glad you're here.

05:54:38.400 --> 05:54:39.400
I'm glad you're here.

05:54:39.400 --> 05:54:42.400
What's the significance of this place?

05:54:42.400 --> 05:54:45.400
This is the headquarters of the Nightingales.

05:54:45.400 --> 05:54:48.400
Cut into the mountainside by the first of our kind.

05:54:48.400 --> 05:54:49.400
See?

05:54:49.400 --> 05:54:52.400
We've come to seek the edge we need to defeat Mercer Frey.

05:54:52.400 --> 05:54:53.400
Okay, yeah.

05:54:53.400 --> 05:54:55.400
What kind of an edge?

05:54:57.400 --> 05:54:59.400
What kind of an edge?

05:54:59.400 --> 05:55:03.400
If you'll follow me, I'll try to explain on the way.

05:55:03.400 --> 05:55:04.400
Yeah.

05:55:04.400 --> 05:55:06.400
This way, please.

05:55:07.400 --> 05:55:10.400
Yeah, let's edge this way, please.

05:55:11.400 --> 05:55:13.400
Oh, look at them steps.

05:55:13.400 --> 05:55:15.400
Mm, look at that bow, though.

05:55:15.400 --> 05:55:17.400
Actually, one level.

05:55:17.400 --> 05:55:22.400
Look at the satchel that the arrow's going.

05:55:22.400 --> 05:55:26.400
I like how they're coded to look like what the arrow is.

05:55:26.400 --> 05:55:27.400
Very nice.

05:55:27.400 --> 05:55:29.400
Very, very nice.

05:55:35.400 --> 05:55:38.400
I never believed that it existed.

05:55:38.400 --> 05:55:40.400
I took enough and I'm back.

05:55:40.400 --> 05:55:42.400
Are you surprised I'm still on?

05:55:44.400 --> 05:55:46.400
Is Emi streaming today?

05:55:46.400 --> 05:55:47.400
Emi?

05:55:47.400 --> 05:55:48.400
Or is it?

05:55:48.400 --> 05:55:51.400
No, Emi should already be on.

05:55:51.400 --> 05:55:56.400
Azur should be coming online in two minutes.

05:55:56.400 --> 05:55:59.400
If I have my times correct.

05:56:02.400 --> 05:56:04.400
Emi's off today.

05:56:05.400 --> 05:56:08.400
Just Sheevie and Mercy, so Mercy's on at one.

05:56:08.400 --> 05:56:11.400
Right, we'll redirect into Mercy.

05:56:11.400 --> 05:56:12.400
Deal?

05:56:12.400 --> 05:56:13.400
I'll make you a deal.

05:56:13.400 --> 05:56:15.400
We'll redirect into Mercy.

05:56:19.400 --> 05:56:23.400
Yeah, but we're in the Nightingale like Robin Hood or something?

05:56:23.400 --> 05:56:30.400
I, the first time I did this, like the Nightingale quest,

05:56:30.400 --> 05:56:33.400
I was in love with Lady Luck.

05:56:33.400 --> 05:56:35.400
I absolutely just...

05:56:36.400 --> 05:56:38.400
Ow, I was very loud in my ear.

05:56:38.400 --> 05:56:40.400
Hopefully that wasn't too loud in your ear.

05:56:40.400 --> 05:56:48.400
I just absolutely and truly adored the little plot.

05:56:50.400 --> 05:56:53.400
I like so cool.

05:56:53.400 --> 05:56:57.400
I just look so amazing and awesome.

05:56:57.400 --> 05:57:00.400
Everything, I am ready for the oath.

05:57:00.400 --> 05:57:02.400
Now you go get changed.

05:57:03.400 --> 05:57:05.400
Best looking armor in the game.

05:57:05.400 --> 05:57:09.400
Honestly, this armor and Dark Brotherhood armor, yeah.

05:57:09.400 --> 05:57:11.400
That's awesome.

05:57:15.400 --> 05:57:19.400
I think we should trust the lass and take the deal.

05:57:19.400 --> 05:57:23.400
I may have misheard you, but Mercy is in three hours.

05:57:23.400 --> 05:57:24.400
No one.

05:57:24.400 --> 05:57:28.400
Yeah, no, Mercy comes online at one o'clock for me.

05:57:28.400 --> 05:57:30.400
One o'clock in the afternoon, yeah?

05:57:30.400 --> 05:57:32.400
That's when Mercy comes online for me.

05:57:32.400 --> 05:57:35.400
So, Mercy's actually perfect for us.

05:57:54.400 --> 05:57:56.400
An arrangement must be struck.

05:57:56.400 --> 05:57:58.400
So dramatic.

05:58:00.400 --> 05:58:03.400
What time did I start streaming?

05:58:03.400 --> 05:58:06.400
Oh, you started streaming, yeah?

05:58:06.400 --> 05:58:09.400
At 4 a.m., yeah?

05:58:09.400 --> 05:58:11.400
I started at 4 a.m.

05:58:13.400 --> 05:58:17.400
You never wondered why everyone's schedule has a cheeky time zone

05:58:17.400 --> 05:58:19.400
that no one uses,

05:58:19.400 --> 05:58:21.400
because that's my time zone.

05:58:24.400 --> 05:58:27.400
Straining on those night hours, yeah?

05:58:28.400 --> 05:58:31.400
Yes, I will become Nightingale.

05:58:31.400 --> 05:58:33.400
Yes, I'm ready.

05:58:35.400 --> 05:58:38.400
Please stand on the western circle.

05:58:38.400 --> 05:58:41.400
Holy crap, 4 a.m., yeah?

05:58:41.400 --> 05:58:44.400
The reason why I stream so early

05:58:44.400 --> 05:58:48.400
is in case I need to do stuff during the day.

05:58:48.400 --> 05:58:53.400
Originally, it was either I stream at 4 a.m. or I stream at 10 a.m.

05:58:53.400 --> 05:58:56.400
But the problem is, if I stream at 10 a.m.,

05:58:56.400 --> 05:59:00.400
the day is over by the time I finish my endurance streams.

05:59:00.400 --> 05:59:05.400
So, I wouldn't be able to do doctor's appointments if I need to make it.

05:59:05.400 --> 05:59:08.400
Lydia, you're going to ruin this so much.

05:59:08.400 --> 05:59:11.400
Please stand elsewhere.

05:59:11.400 --> 05:59:13.400
Or just go...

05:59:13.400 --> 05:59:16.400
Lydia, you're going to ruin this scene so much.

05:59:16.400 --> 05:59:18.400
I'm not being funny.

05:59:18.400 --> 05:59:22.400
Come here, Lydia. You're going to ruin the awesomeness of this scene.

05:59:22.400 --> 05:59:24.400
Lydia.

05:59:24.400 --> 05:59:26.400
Wait here.

05:59:26.400 --> 05:59:29.400
Thank you. There's such a beautiful cinematic coming up

05:59:29.400 --> 05:59:31.400
and they don't know what it is yet.

05:59:31.400 --> 05:59:34.400
Just let it happen.

05:59:34.400 --> 05:59:36.400
Oh, not Lydia standing in the corner, right?

05:59:36.400 --> 05:59:38.400
Just don't look at her. Don't acknowledge her, okay?

05:59:38.400 --> 05:59:41.400
She's like a dinosaur.

05:59:41.400 --> 05:59:44.400
Alright, let's enjoy this because this is actually pretty cool.

05:59:52.400 --> 05:59:55.400
I've come before you to throw myself upon your mercy

05:59:55.400 --> 05:59:58.400
and to accept responsibility for my failure.

05:59:58.400 --> 06:00:01.400
You're already mine, Carlisle.

06:00:01.400 --> 06:00:04.400
Your terms were struck long ago.

06:00:04.400 --> 06:00:08.400
What could you possibly offer me now?

06:00:08.400 --> 06:00:11.400
I have two others that wish to transact the oath

06:00:11.400 --> 06:00:14.400
to serve you both in life and in death.

06:00:14.400 --> 06:00:17.400
You surprise me, Carlisle.

06:00:17.400 --> 06:00:20.400
This offer is definitely weighted in my favor.

06:00:20.400 --> 06:00:22.400
In my favor.

06:00:42.400 --> 06:00:44.400
I ain't saying none of this.

06:00:50.400 --> 06:00:52.400
What's the next?

06:01:06.400 --> 06:01:08.400
Monka.

06:01:12.400 --> 06:01:14.400
Wait, we don't get to see her?

06:01:16.400 --> 06:01:18.400
I didn't see her.

06:01:18.400 --> 06:01:20.400
Norm, I thought we got to see her.

06:01:20.400 --> 06:01:22.400
I guess it's with the next cinematic.

06:01:22.400 --> 06:01:24.400
What do you mean, we?

06:01:27.400 --> 06:01:29.400
Yes, it's true, Crane.

06:01:30.400 --> 06:01:32.400
He's done more.

06:01:36.400 --> 06:01:38.400
The Scaly Key.

06:01:40.400 --> 06:01:42.400
Big Scaly.

06:01:43.400 --> 06:01:46.400
So the key doesn't lock any doors.

06:02:06.400 --> 06:02:09.400
The three sounds like no one should possess it.

06:02:12.400 --> 06:02:15.400
It's too much power for one human to have.

06:02:19.400 --> 06:02:21.400
We see her when we return the key.

06:02:21.400 --> 06:02:23.400
Yes, we will do that.

06:02:33.400 --> 06:02:36.400
First time I've ever set out to return something?

06:02:43.400 --> 06:02:45.400
Let's go then.

06:02:48.400 --> 06:02:51.400
Alright, Big Brinny, what's up?

06:02:58.400 --> 06:03:00.400
Oh my God, he's tapping his feet.

06:03:00.400 --> 06:03:02.400
Oh, he's doing the Irish dance for us.

06:03:12.400 --> 06:03:14.400
After we deal with him,

06:03:14.400 --> 06:03:17.400
all that remains is restoring the guild to its full strength.

06:03:17.400 --> 06:03:21.400
As a result, there won't be anything that you have attention to.

06:03:27.400 --> 06:03:30.400
I've been at this game a long time, my friend.

06:03:30.400 --> 06:03:32.400
A long time. I've stolen trinkets from nobles,

06:03:32.400 --> 06:03:34.400
and turned priests for murder.

06:03:34.400 --> 06:03:36.400
I'm good at what I do.

06:03:36.400 --> 06:03:38.400
Maybe even one of the best,

06:03:38.400 --> 06:03:40.400
but it's all I know.

06:03:40.400 --> 06:03:42.400
It's on your words, but your foot is moving

06:03:42.400 --> 06:03:44.400
and it's making me laugh.

06:03:47.400 --> 06:03:49.400
It's about time. No, it's not right.

06:03:49.400 --> 06:03:51.400
I don't know what to say.

06:03:55.400 --> 06:03:58.400
So don't get sentimental on me now, I accept.

06:04:03.400 --> 06:04:05.400
We'll handle the details.

06:04:05.400 --> 06:04:09.400
Oh, we have quite the task ahead.

06:04:09.400 --> 06:04:11.400
Then let's get to it.

06:04:14.400 --> 06:04:17.400
What if we try to use the key on strongy?

06:04:17.400 --> 06:04:20.400
And in playing, you don't have free reign of me?

06:04:21.400 --> 06:04:24.400
Reef playing, you know me better than that.

06:04:30.400 --> 06:04:33.400
Lydia, I'm sorry that I put you in exile.

06:04:33.400 --> 06:04:35.400
Yes, follow me.

06:04:35.400 --> 06:04:37.400
My thing.

06:04:38.400 --> 06:04:41.400
I can't believe I made myself Lydia 2.0.

06:04:41.400 --> 06:04:44.400
Strongy using the key on reefing?

06:04:46.400 --> 06:04:49.400
It's funny, you think you have any resistance against me.

06:04:59.400 --> 06:05:02.400
Roy is regaining his own foot in the way he tap him.

06:05:03.400 --> 06:05:05.400
Here.

06:05:08.400 --> 06:05:11.400
Oh yeah, becoming the guild master is bugged

06:05:11.400 --> 06:05:13.400
if you don't do the radiant quest first.

06:05:13.400 --> 06:05:16.400
Oh, I've always managed to do them after.

06:05:17.400 --> 06:05:19.400
I don't even know how they...

06:05:19.400 --> 06:05:23.400
Where the heck do you expect me to go?

06:05:24.400 --> 06:05:26.400
Eh, let's do that then.

06:05:26.400 --> 06:05:29.400
Strongy, considering you don't have many lockpicks,

06:05:29.400 --> 06:05:32.400
it may be beneficial just to hold on to it for a while.

06:05:32.400 --> 06:05:34.400
Honestly though.

06:05:34.400 --> 06:05:36.400
Right, I need to go a little to the left.

06:05:36.400 --> 06:05:39.400
Not to be confused with the hit steam game.

06:05:39.400 --> 06:05:41.400
A little to the left.

06:05:42.400 --> 06:05:44.400
Let's get to it.

06:05:44.400 --> 06:05:47.400
If I can get up this hill, then the enemies in that building

06:05:47.400 --> 06:05:49.400
won't be able to annoy me.

06:05:49.400 --> 06:05:51.400
Why would I resist strongy?

06:05:51.400 --> 06:05:53.400
Exactly, why would you?

06:05:53.400 --> 06:05:55.400
Anyone who puts up with me?

06:05:55.400 --> 06:05:57.400
Anyone who puts up a fight gets...

06:05:58.400 --> 06:06:00.400
Twice as hard.

06:06:02.400 --> 06:06:05.400
Hopefully you can figure out what the substitute was for that word.

06:06:06.400 --> 06:06:07.400
That's terrible.

06:06:07.400 --> 06:06:08.400
Wait, that's north.

06:06:08.400 --> 06:06:09.400
I'm going the wrong way.

06:06:09.400 --> 06:06:11.400
No, it's like along the waterfront.

06:06:14.400 --> 06:06:16.400
And just what?

06:06:16.400 --> 06:06:18.400
Sounds good.

06:06:18.400 --> 06:06:19.400
Hi, strongy.

06:06:19.400 --> 06:06:21.400
Dang, you're going hard into this game.

06:06:21.400 --> 06:06:23.400
We haven't even finished one quest lane yet.

06:06:23.400 --> 06:06:25.400
It's officially been six hours

06:06:25.400 --> 06:06:27.400
and I haven't finished one quest lane.

06:06:27.400 --> 06:06:29.400
I completely forgot how

06:06:29.400 --> 06:06:32.400
just humongous what this game is.

06:06:32.400 --> 06:06:34.400
It's extraordinary

06:06:36.400 --> 06:06:38.400
that I haven't actually...

06:06:38.400 --> 06:06:40.400
I'm about to get close to finishing the thieves.

06:06:40.400 --> 06:06:42.400
But even then, I'm not even going to truly finish them

06:06:42.400 --> 06:06:44.400
due to the reason

06:06:44.400 --> 06:06:46.400
of...

06:06:47.400 --> 06:06:49.400
of what?

06:06:50.400 --> 06:06:52.400
Of...

06:06:52.400 --> 06:06:54.400
Because we're not even going to do

06:06:54.400 --> 06:06:56.400
those miscellaneous quests for the Thief's Guild

06:06:56.400 --> 06:06:58.400
to restore it to its final glory.

06:06:59.400 --> 06:07:01.400
Cause...

06:07:01.400 --> 06:07:03.400
Do I take the lift here?

06:07:03.400 --> 06:07:05.400
No, I still don't take the lift.

06:07:06.400 --> 06:07:08.400
Keep the skeleton key for yourself.

06:07:08.400 --> 06:07:10.400
No, I'll be a good girl

06:07:10.400 --> 06:07:12.400
because I want to see a mummy nocturnal.

06:07:12.400 --> 06:07:14.400
I really like her design.

06:07:16.400 --> 06:07:18.400
I wouldn't mind

06:07:18.400 --> 06:07:20.400
incorporating...

06:07:20.400 --> 06:07:22.400
I wouldn't mind.

06:07:22.400 --> 06:07:24.400
It's a very good design.

06:07:24.400 --> 06:07:26.400
Now the heck did I get where I'm going?

06:07:26.400 --> 06:07:28.400
Literally every time I have to go somewhere

06:07:28.400 --> 06:07:30.400
I just start spamming E on a hill

06:07:30.400 --> 06:07:32.400
and I'm like, is this where I'm supposed to go?

06:07:33.400 --> 06:07:35.400
No, I don't really have to walk up the hill yet.

06:07:35.400 --> 06:07:37.400
No, I don't have to walk up the hill.

06:07:37.400 --> 06:07:39.400
It's fine. It's fine.

06:07:39.400 --> 06:07:41.400
I saw that orbing.

06:07:42.400 --> 06:07:44.400
I'm not sure if I should resist or not.

06:07:44.400 --> 06:07:47.400
Either way, the outcome is clear.

06:07:48.400 --> 06:07:50.400
The hard...

06:07:50.400 --> 06:07:52.400
Oh, I thought it was the wind.

06:07:52.400 --> 06:07:54.400
It was rules.

06:07:54.400 --> 06:07:56.400
You don't need the key when you get a log pick into a hundred.

06:07:56.400 --> 06:07:58.400
Oh, I didn't mean that.

06:07:58.400 --> 06:08:01.400
Does everything just become easy piece of lemon squeezy?

06:08:01.400 --> 06:08:04.400
Or do the log picks not break on a hundred or something?

06:08:04.400 --> 06:08:06.400
We're getting there.

06:08:06.400 --> 06:08:08.400
We can do it. I believe in us.

06:08:08.400 --> 06:08:10.400
We're just a little exhausted.

06:08:12.400 --> 06:08:14.400
I'm scarous.

06:08:14.400 --> 06:08:16.400
I thought for some reason

06:08:16.400 --> 06:08:18.400
you said I'm scouse

06:08:18.400 --> 06:08:20.400
and I was like, right?

06:08:20.400 --> 06:08:22.400
Now what?

06:08:22.400 --> 06:08:24.400
Oh yeah, by the way, I'm scouse.

06:08:24.400 --> 06:08:26.400
I like the way you talk, Scottish lass.

06:08:28.400 --> 06:08:30.400
You know, right?

06:08:30.400 --> 06:08:32.400
Can I buy a cheeky Maccas?

06:08:32.400 --> 06:08:34.400
Wait, Maccas is Australian term.

06:08:34.400 --> 06:08:36.400
I can't believe it.

06:08:36.400 --> 06:08:38.400
We're boarding live here today.

06:08:38.400 --> 06:08:40.400
Today, we are going to...

06:08:40.400 --> 06:08:44.400
This place is actually covered in bandits.

06:08:44.400 --> 06:08:46.400
I cannot for the life of me doing Australian accent.

06:08:50.400 --> 06:08:52.400
Right, what's this?

06:08:52.400 --> 06:08:54.400
A gate. Open the gate. Why not?

06:08:54.400 --> 06:08:56.400
That might come and help me

06:08:56.400 --> 06:08:58.400
with future...

06:08:58.400 --> 06:09:00.400
Go on a Maccas run, yeah?

06:09:00.400 --> 06:09:02.400
Get in void with me, yeah?

06:09:02.400 --> 06:09:04.400
Oh, I thought I was going to one-shot you.

06:09:04.400 --> 06:09:06.400
I'm going to be honest.

06:09:06.400 --> 06:09:08.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can beg for mercy

06:09:08.400 --> 06:09:10.400
when you're dead.

06:09:14.400 --> 06:09:16.400
P-pop-pop...

06:09:26.400 --> 06:09:28.400
Oh, I bonked him. Right, give me that.

06:09:28.400 --> 06:09:30.400
I will destroy that.

06:09:30.400 --> 06:09:32.400
What is this? Can someone look this up?

06:09:32.400 --> 06:09:34.400
What am I supposed to do with this?

06:09:34.400 --> 06:09:36.400
Flawed Var-la Stone.

06:09:36.400 --> 06:09:38.400
I don't know what it is.

06:09:38.400 --> 06:09:40.400
Flawed Var-la Stone.

06:09:40.400 --> 06:09:42.400
I've never seen them before.

06:09:42.400 --> 06:09:47.400
before PC seems to have them, Xbox doesn't seem to have them.

06:09:47.400 --> 06:09:49.200
But Mercedes in three hours!

06:09:49.200 --> 06:09:50.800
Say a shout out to Mercedes!

06:09:50.800 --> 06:09:52.600
Sorry, I got a lot of gold itch on my head.

06:09:52.600 --> 06:09:55.000
I like to see them.

06:09:55.000 --> 06:09:58.700
Speak to Carlaya.

06:09:58.700 --> 06:10:02.800
Ooh, they got a good look.

06:10:02.800 --> 06:10:07.800
Expert is about much, I've done that for souls.

06:10:07.800 --> 06:10:10.500
Right, the machines drop.

06:10:10.500 --> 06:10:14.700
Where's Lydia?

06:10:14.700 --> 06:10:17.000
Lydia, you do this all the time.

06:10:17.000 --> 06:10:20.300
There should be an enemy that pops out of here, yeah.

06:10:20.300 --> 06:10:21.400
Oh, that's right, I remember.

06:10:21.400 --> 06:10:24.600
These guys used to treat me out.

06:10:24.600 --> 06:10:27.600
I'm actually, I'll tell you what, that was like really loud.

06:10:27.600 --> 06:10:31.200
I'm going to...

06:10:31.200 --> 06:10:35.800
...settings, audio.

06:10:35.800 --> 06:10:37.600
Is that a bit better on your ears?

06:10:37.600 --> 06:10:43.500
I feel like whenever that happens, it's so loud.

06:10:43.500 --> 06:10:46.800
A new hand has touched the beacon.

06:10:46.800 --> 06:10:48.200
Now, these do drop, yeah.

06:10:48.200 --> 06:10:53.300
That's exactly what I'm wanting, like tons of these soul gems.

06:10:53.300 --> 06:10:54.000
Where's the enemy?

06:10:54.000 --> 06:10:55.500
I love the enemy.

06:10:55.500 --> 06:10:57.400
Just got an enemy.

06:10:57.400 --> 06:10:59.300
Ooh, hold on.

06:10:59.300 --> 06:11:00.900
My two hands is 46.

06:11:00.900 --> 06:11:04.600
We're getting there, we're getting there.

06:11:04.600 --> 06:11:06.200
Yes, oh my goodness.

06:11:06.200 --> 06:11:09.800
This is what we want, like massive amounts of these soul gems.

06:11:09.800 --> 06:11:13.300
And then we can put like really good stuff on.

06:11:13.300 --> 06:11:17.600
There should be one that pops out of here.

06:11:17.600 --> 06:11:18.600
Yeah.

06:11:18.600 --> 06:11:19.900
Oh, I'm getting too good.

06:11:19.900 --> 06:11:23.400
I'm genuinely too good at this game, I'm sorry.

06:11:23.400 --> 06:11:26.200
The fact that I remember from childhood,

06:11:26.200 --> 06:11:28.900
where the enemies like come out.

06:11:28.900 --> 06:11:35.000
I'm not sure how scared I was with the enemies.

06:11:35.000 --> 06:11:35.900
Come here.

06:11:35.900 --> 06:11:37.500
Okay, there we go.

06:11:37.500 --> 06:11:39.500
What was that, three to scavenge?

06:11:39.500 --> 06:11:42.800
Oh, I'll take it, I'll take it.

06:11:42.800 --> 06:11:44.200
I'll take it, I'll take anything.

06:11:44.200 --> 06:11:48.200
I'm happy with anything, any offerings I'll take.

06:11:48.200 --> 06:11:52.100
Oh, yeah.

06:11:52.100 --> 06:11:55.000
Is the enemy from here?

06:11:55.000 --> 06:11:57.000
Here.

06:11:57.000 --> 06:11:58.900
Oh, I heard that.

06:11:58.900 --> 06:12:07.100
I heard them like spidering up here.

06:12:07.100 --> 06:12:13.300
I can hear enemy.

06:12:13.300 --> 06:12:19.600
Oh, I heard two just one in there, but I need to go here.

06:12:19.600 --> 06:12:22.900
They're so tiny.

06:12:22.900 --> 06:12:26.500
They're so tiny.

06:12:26.500 --> 06:12:28.800
Oh, we are getting so many soldiers.

06:12:28.800 --> 06:12:32.100
This is exactly what I was needing, one of the runs in here.

06:12:32.100 --> 06:12:38.400
That spawn sneak is actually impressive.

06:12:38.400 --> 06:12:44.800
Ah.

06:12:44.800 --> 06:12:47.900
There, them.

06:12:47.900 --> 06:12:49.400
Okay, we can destroy that.

06:12:49.400 --> 06:12:54.600
Yeah, let's go.

06:12:54.700 --> 06:12:58.200
Alchemy, Arvin.

06:12:58.200 --> 06:13:01.800
Yeah, yeah, I'll take the potions, let's go.

06:13:01.800 --> 06:13:07.400
Oh my god, I just jumped in real life because of that noise of that latch.

06:13:07.400 --> 06:13:09.600
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

06:13:09.600 --> 06:13:12.900
Oh, hello.

06:13:12.900 --> 06:13:14.500
I hope you aren't too late.

06:13:14.500 --> 06:13:18.100
Oh, those bandits back there.

06:13:18.100 --> 06:13:20.900
Dot, dot, dot.

06:13:25.200 --> 06:13:26.500
Mm-hmm.

06:13:26.500 --> 06:13:29.400
I had the brap lever literally jump scare of me.

06:13:37.400 --> 06:13:40.300
Oh, he really got me there, didn't he?

06:13:40.300 --> 06:13:42.700
Oh, soul gems.

06:13:42.700 --> 06:13:47.400
We love soul gems, soul gems, soul gems, soul gems.

06:13:47.400 --> 06:13:48.900
Oh, wait, is this the thing?

06:13:48.900 --> 06:13:50.100
I'm supposed to watch him.

06:13:50.100 --> 06:13:51.600
Look, there he is.

06:13:51.600 --> 06:13:53.500
Look through the bars.

06:13:53.500 --> 06:13:55.700
I'm trying to, where is he?

06:13:55.700 --> 06:13:59.400
I'm pretty sure he pops out somewhere here.

06:13:59.400 --> 06:14:02.500
And this is a, this is an instance report.

06:14:02.500 --> 06:14:04.600
I've returned to continue watching.

06:14:04.600 --> 06:14:07.500
Where?

06:14:07.500 --> 06:14:09.200
Oh, there he is, there he is.

06:14:09.200 --> 06:14:10.000
That's Mercer.

06:14:10.000 --> 06:14:11.700
Look, I'm crawling over.

06:14:11.700 --> 06:14:14.800
Look at this little cinematic.

06:14:14.800 --> 06:14:16.800
I like how they just expire right now.

06:14:17.300 --> 06:14:27.800
Oh, they didn't even move a sword.

06:14:27.800 --> 06:14:32.000
Eyelash, and we'll be ready for him.

06:14:32.000 --> 06:14:34.200
Man, the FOV is so low.

06:14:34.200 --> 06:14:35.500
Do you get motion sickness?

06:14:35.500 --> 06:14:38.600
No.

06:14:38.600 --> 06:14:41.000
I'm very lucky, Mercy says she gets motion sickness

06:14:41.000 --> 06:14:42.900
playing video games.

06:14:42.900 --> 06:14:45.800
Not to be dramatic, but I think I would end it.

06:14:45.800 --> 06:14:50.800
Oh, God, I think there's a farmer around here.

06:14:50.800 --> 06:14:52.100
What's this?

06:14:52.100 --> 06:14:54.000
Potions.

06:14:54.000 --> 06:14:55.200
Lutions and potions.

06:14:55.200 --> 06:14:58.000
I do love a good, I do love a good collection.

06:14:58.000 --> 06:14:59.500
Isn't there a farmer here?

06:14:59.500 --> 06:15:00.600
No?

06:15:00.600 --> 06:15:02.100
Empty?

06:15:02.100 --> 06:15:03.600
Oh, found him.

06:15:03.600 --> 06:15:05.900
Found him.

06:15:05.900 --> 06:15:08.700
And I have course of poison.

06:15:08.700 --> 06:15:12.500
What does he draw?

06:15:12.500 --> 06:15:14.500
Skibertail, nah, you're good.

06:15:14.500 --> 06:15:18.800
You, I want your soul gems.

06:15:18.800 --> 06:15:21.100
Who am I perishing?

06:15:21.100 --> 06:15:23.600
Why is Mercer such a poofy poofy?

06:15:23.600 --> 06:15:25.100
Oh!

06:15:35.200 --> 06:15:38.900
I just smacked myself into a wall at low health.

06:15:38.900 --> 06:15:40.500
Okay, that'll do.

06:15:40.500 --> 06:15:43.100
I think I'll be okay now.

06:15:43.100 --> 06:15:48.700
That was a jump scare and a half.

06:15:48.700 --> 06:15:50.000
Okay, we're fine.

06:15:50.000 --> 06:15:50.700
We're fine.

06:15:50.700 --> 06:15:51.400
We're fine.

06:15:51.400 --> 06:15:54.900
Actually, it's probably really good that I have that on a panic

06:15:54.900 --> 06:15:58.900
because it gets me away from the enemy really quickly.

06:15:58.900 --> 06:15:59.900
The heck is this?

06:15:59.900 --> 06:16:03.800
Let's just stop.

06:16:03.800 --> 06:16:07.000
Oh, I need to go up.

06:16:07.000 --> 06:16:11.400
Excuse me.

06:16:11.400 --> 06:16:17.000
The freaking blades on the ground took all my eggspear.

06:16:17.000 --> 06:16:22.400
Are we having a troll?

06:16:22.400 --> 06:16:26.600
That's, eh?

06:16:26.600 --> 06:16:29.700
And where's the other lever?

06:16:29.700 --> 06:16:32.900
Excuse me, Brynjolf, you're just smacked me in the...

06:16:32.900 --> 06:16:35.700
That's the other lever there?

06:16:35.700 --> 06:16:38.400
Behind an eggspear?

06:16:38.400 --> 06:16:40.700
That can't be right.

06:16:40.700 --> 06:16:42.700
Surely not.

06:16:42.700 --> 06:16:49.000
But it is.

06:16:49.000 --> 06:16:50.400
That can't be right.

06:16:50.400 --> 06:16:51.600
Don't you have the skeleton key?

06:16:51.600 --> 06:16:57.900
No, we've not done that part.

06:16:57.900 --> 06:17:03.600
But that is it.

06:17:03.600 --> 06:17:06.900
Well, good thing I don't have a smurf it, but what?

06:17:06.900 --> 06:17:07.600
Wait.

06:17:07.600 --> 06:17:11.400
Oh, that's not the lever at all.

06:17:11.400 --> 06:17:16.600
Where the heck's the first lever?

06:17:16.600 --> 06:17:20.300
Is it here?

06:17:20.300 --> 06:17:21.800
Where's the second lever?

06:17:21.800 --> 06:17:26.400
Reveal yourself.

06:17:26.400 --> 06:17:27.800
What?

06:17:27.800 --> 06:17:29.000
Oh, there it is.

06:17:29.000 --> 06:17:31.700
Oh, it's adjacent to the other lever.

06:17:31.700 --> 06:17:33.800
Oh my god.

06:17:33.800 --> 06:17:36.300
Then you can go all the way back again.

06:17:36.300 --> 06:17:38.600
Out my way, out my way, out my way, out my way.

06:17:38.600 --> 06:17:40.000
I'm not that fast.

06:17:40.000 --> 06:17:41.600
I'm not that fast.

06:17:41.600 --> 06:17:43.200
Hold on, hold on, I need to cheat.

06:17:43.200 --> 06:17:44.400
I'm not that fast.

06:17:44.400 --> 06:17:54.000
I was gonna say, putting something behind an eggspear level thing is wild.

06:17:54.000 --> 06:17:54.800
That wasn't it?

06:17:54.800 --> 06:17:57.200
Okay, I was gonna say that has to be it.

06:17:57.200 --> 06:18:00.800
I refuse.

06:18:00.800 --> 06:18:04.400
A little cheeky chess.

06:18:04.400 --> 06:18:11.700
I'm being trolled by this game.

06:18:11.700 --> 06:18:15.500
I'm being trolled.

06:18:15.500 --> 06:18:19.300
I'll destroy that, and then I can get more thingy.

06:18:19.300 --> 06:18:20.500
Are we there yet, bruv?

06:18:20.500 --> 06:18:21.200
I feel the same.

06:18:21.200 --> 06:18:23.600
We've literally not even finished one quest line.

06:18:23.600 --> 06:18:26.300
I'm ready to make another cup of tea.

06:18:26.300 --> 06:18:30.800
All right, you can stealth this area, but I'd rather just go for it.

06:18:30.800 --> 06:18:33.800
I'd rather just go for it.

06:18:33.800 --> 06:18:41.700
Earthquake, cheeky bit of an earthquake.

06:18:41.700 --> 06:18:43.000
By the Pope, who's there?

06:18:43.000 --> 06:18:45.200
Identify yourself.

06:18:45.200 --> 06:18:49.600
There is a chess down below, but I'm not really fast right now.

06:18:49.600 --> 06:18:53.800
I want to finish one quest line.

06:18:53.800 --> 06:18:57.100
One quest line is all I ask.

06:18:57.100 --> 06:18:58.100
Stop it.

06:18:58.100 --> 06:19:01.800
You're so stinky.

06:19:01.800 --> 06:19:02.400
Okay, hold on.

06:19:02.400 --> 06:19:03.200
You got something.

06:19:03.300 --> 06:19:04.500
Shaman's key.

06:19:04.500 --> 06:19:05.000
What was this?

06:19:05.000 --> 06:19:08.000
The shaman's key, dude.

06:19:08.000 --> 06:19:09.500
Oh, is it for that?

06:19:09.500 --> 06:19:09.800
You know what?

06:19:09.800 --> 06:19:12.600
I might be the chest.

06:19:12.600 --> 06:19:13.400
No, it's not.

06:19:13.400 --> 06:19:14.800
Well, I'm not looting it then.

06:19:14.800 --> 06:19:15.800
Go away.

06:19:15.800 --> 06:19:19.100
I don't know what the heck the shaman's key is for.

06:19:19.100 --> 06:19:21.200
Clapham stinky lining, honestly.

06:19:21.200 --> 06:19:22.500
I mean, how do you come back from that?

06:19:22.500 --> 06:19:23.600
Someone calls you stinky.

06:19:23.600 --> 06:19:25.800
You have no way of coming back, truly.

06:19:25.800 --> 06:19:26.600
It's over for you.

06:19:26.600 --> 06:19:28.400
Just admit it.

06:19:28.400 --> 06:19:30.800
There's traps everywhere.

06:19:30.800 --> 06:19:33.800
Isn't there a massive Centaurian coming up?

06:19:33.800 --> 06:19:40.400
My brains just reminded me that there's like a big enemy coming soon.

06:19:40.400 --> 06:19:43.200
What does that say?

06:19:43.200 --> 06:19:45.400
Bruv, the game thinks I can read that?

06:19:45.400 --> 06:19:47.700
Mercer, it's backwards.

06:19:47.700 --> 06:19:52.400
Mercer is on the bottom.

06:19:52.400 --> 06:19:57.100
One, two.

06:19:57.100 --> 06:19:58.400
Why is that backwards?

06:19:58.400 --> 06:20:00.200
I can read Mercer as backwards.

06:20:00.200 --> 06:20:02.600
I don't mind the stinky.

06:20:02.600 --> 06:20:04.400
I don't mind the wise.

06:20:04.400 --> 06:20:05.700
What, an air?

06:20:05.700 --> 06:20:10.200
Why is it backwards?

06:20:10.200 --> 06:20:12.600
I'll take these scrolls because I can sell them for money.

06:20:23.600 --> 06:20:25.800
This is very real.

06:20:26.800 --> 06:20:31.700
Oh, dear.

06:20:31.700 --> 06:20:36.600
Right, can you jump the Centaurian and not me, maybe?

06:20:36.600 --> 06:20:39.600
Oh, goodness, gravy.

06:20:39.600 --> 06:20:42.400
Some of these enemies.

06:20:42.400 --> 06:20:44.800
Am I right, fellas?

06:20:44.800 --> 06:20:48.200
Oh, my fellas.

06:20:48.200 --> 06:20:49.900
Oh.

06:20:49.900 --> 06:20:52.200
Oh, hold on.

06:20:52.200 --> 06:20:56.200
Hold on, right, there you go.

06:20:56.200 --> 06:20:57.300
All right, I should probably go to sleep.

06:20:57.300 --> 06:20:58.200
See you next time.

06:20:58.200 --> 06:20:59.700
Rest well, those who sleep.

06:20:59.700 --> 06:21:02.800
Please don't worry if you do need to go to sleep again.

06:21:02.800 --> 06:21:04.600
Bit of a cheeky endurance stream.

06:21:04.600 --> 06:21:08.200
Mercer is going live in T-minus less than three hours.

06:21:08.200 --> 06:21:14.300
We are going to raid Dinter because my Skyrim escapades got cut short

06:21:14.300 --> 06:21:18.900
due to the fact that, oh, I am moving so fast.

06:21:18.900 --> 06:21:21.700
I am successfully avoiding all the traps laid out.

06:21:21.700 --> 06:21:27.000
Yes, I don't know why achievements aren't popping up.

06:21:27.000 --> 06:21:33.200
I'm literally using Xbox Game Pass right now, so it's kind of the...

06:21:33.200 --> 06:21:39.800
I'm not sure what the dealio is, but I'm quite happy just to play through the...

06:21:39.800 --> 06:21:46.700
Thingamabobber and tomorrow's monetization celebration.

06:21:46.700 --> 06:21:51.800
So I guess I can enjoy like a more relaxed for my boys.

06:21:51.800 --> 06:21:54.800
Oh, come on.

06:21:54.800 --> 06:21:56.900
Oh, come on.

06:21:56.900 --> 06:21:59.500
Get a rest.

06:21:59.500 --> 06:22:00.400
Oh, I'm low health.

06:22:00.400 --> 06:22:01.000
Oh, I'm low health.

06:22:01.000 --> 06:22:02.500
I'm about to get altered by a spider.

06:22:02.500 --> 06:22:04.400
Hold on.

06:22:04.400 --> 06:22:08.100
Okay, there we go.

06:22:08.100 --> 06:22:11.000
Go around to read it.

06:22:11.000 --> 06:22:12.700
Go around it to read it.

06:22:12.700 --> 06:22:15.900
Oh, is there like another room that makes a lot more sense

06:22:15.900 --> 06:22:18.200
if there was like something behind it?

06:22:18.200 --> 06:22:23.300
Me here just ignored it and chose to be confused.

06:22:23.300 --> 06:22:24.200
Oh, give me that.

06:22:24.200 --> 06:22:25.700
Oh, orcishbowl and ice.

06:22:25.700 --> 06:22:27.800
Oh, and alchemy.

06:22:27.800 --> 06:22:32.600
Resurrect and restore my energy.

06:22:32.600 --> 06:22:36.000
Mmm.

06:22:36.000 --> 06:22:40.600
Alchemyxing like a DJ.

06:22:40.600 --> 06:22:43.800
Give me them juicy soul gems.

06:22:43.800 --> 06:22:45.000
That's all I want.

06:22:45.000 --> 06:22:46.100
That's all I crave.

06:22:46.100 --> 06:22:49.800
I just want soul gems.

06:22:49.800 --> 06:22:51.700
Oh, I might get one of you.

06:22:51.700 --> 06:22:53.900
No.

06:22:53.900 --> 06:22:55.400
Okay, okay.

06:22:55.400 --> 06:22:57.300
You guys don't need to perfectly follow me.

06:22:57.300 --> 06:22:58.600
You do realize that, right?

06:22:58.600 --> 06:23:00.900
But we can do this.

06:23:00.900 --> 06:23:08.500
And we completely missed them because we alerted the enemies to our location.

06:23:08.500 --> 06:23:09.800
Okay, there we go.

06:23:09.800 --> 06:23:10.500
Oh, my God, he's beat.

06:23:10.500 --> 06:23:14.300
He jumped in me.

06:23:14.300 --> 06:23:15.300
I'm actually beating that.

06:23:15.300 --> 06:23:16.400
I wasn't beating him.

06:23:16.400 --> 06:23:20.200
God, they have so much venom.

06:23:20.200 --> 06:23:23.900
So much venom.

06:23:23.900 --> 06:23:24.600
Don't mind if I do it.

06:23:24.600 --> 06:23:26.700
What on earth were they doing?

06:23:26.700 --> 06:23:30.200
Sheebie, what have you been doing in your dungeon?

06:23:30.200 --> 06:23:32.000
These last words?

06:23:32.000 --> 06:23:33.100
Oh, my God, that's brutal.

06:23:33.100 --> 06:23:35.300
Hold on.

06:23:35.300 --> 06:23:37.900
These last words.

06:23:37.900 --> 06:23:39.400
Nobody thought they were real,

06:23:39.400 --> 06:23:42.000
but I've seen them in the eyes of the snow elves.

06:23:42.000 --> 06:23:46.800
The dwarves thought they took them from the Thawmer,

06:23:46.800 --> 06:23:48.100
but they themselves were fooled.

06:23:48.100 --> 06:23:50.600
A statue built in secrecy by the slaves.

06:23:50.600 --> 06:23:51.800
The eyes burn into you,

06:23:51.800 --> 06:23:53.700
and I see them even now.

06:23:53.700 --> 06:23:56.200
Sarafa escaped through the collapsing tunnel,

06:23:56.200 --> 06:23:58.000
but he'll never escape what we've seen.

06:23:58.000 --> 06:23:59.300
Men will never believe him,

06:23:59.300 --> 06:24:02.700
and he'll be driven mad by the knowledge that he'll never see them again.

06:24:02.700 --> 06:24:08.600
But I may yet see them again before I die.

06:24:08.600 --> 06:24:11.800
Wow, that was strange.

06:24:11.800 --> 06:24:13.400
Johnny's a soul gem addict.

06:24:13.400 --> 06:24:16.700
Literally, they're like the most OP leveling up system.

06:24:16.700 --> 06:24:18.200
I'm just going to blast through this area

06:24:18.200 --> 06:24:26.700
because there's a massive flamethrower, I think, or something.

06:24:26.700 --> 06:24:29.200
How am I detected if I'm around the corner?

06:24:29.200 --> 06:24:31.100
Why are you going for me?

06:24:31.100 --> 06:24:35.500
He's right there.

06:24:35.500 --> 06:24:37.500
Literally, right.

06:24:37.500 --> 06:24:40.900
Actually, I just remembered Mercer drops are really good.

06:24:40.900 --> 06:24:45.300
Two-handed sword, and we already got children.

06:24:45.300 --> 06:24:49.000
Yeah, that's right. Spank that rat on the fire.

06:24:49.000 --> 06:24:52.600
Oh.

06:24:52.600 --> 06:24:56.500
Oh, let's go.

06:24:56.500 --> 06:24:59.200
Oh, my fellows.

06:24:59.200 --> 06:25:00.300
Oh, I'm getting...

06:25:00.300 --> 06:25:04.700
Yeah, okay. I was the same kind of blasted by this.

06:25:04.700 --> 06:25:10.500
We may yet to see Johnny's eyes before we die.

06:25:10.500 --> 06:25:15.100
I might need to heal.

06:25:15.100 --> 06:25:21.100
Or I might get a wave of thought.

06:25:21.100 --> 06:25:22.300
Ooh, we've been...

06:25:22.300 --> 06:25:23.200
Oh, I got detected.

06:25:23.200 --> 06:25:24.800
I keep going, like, all right.

06:25:24.800 --> 06:25:27.100
I'll finally go sneak, and then I get detected

06:25:27.100 --> 06:25:32.500
because I'm not paying attention.

06:25:32.500 --> 06:25:34.100
Touch this.

06:25:34.100 --> 06:25:36.100
Eat this.

06:25:36.100 --> 06:25:38.400
Fun fact, the Dwemer and Elden Scrolls are not doors,

06:25:38.400 --> 06:25:40.100
but actually, a type of elf.

06:25:40.100 --> 06:25:41.100
Two-handed.

06:25:41.100 --> 06:25:43.100
He isn't a drill wielder.

06:25:43.100 --> 06:25:44.900
Exactly.

06:25:44.900 --> 06:25:46.400
Imagine not being a drill wielder.

06:25:46.400 --> 06:25:49.300
I can't relate.

06:25:49.300 --> 06:25:51.700
I've tried so many times to be an archer,

06:25:51.700 --> 06:25:53.800
but I just can't do it.

06:25:53.800 --> 06:25:56.300
Like, especially when the enemy come up in your face

06:25:56.300 --> 06:25:57.700
and you've got a bow and arrow,

06:25:57.700 --> 06:26:02.400
it's like, bro, wouldn't actually be so furofuro.

06:26:03.000 --> 06:26:07.500
I think that actually does more damage to the mother.

06:26:07.500 --> 06:26:10.800
Wait, can I get them to deal with the enemies?

06:26:10.800 --> 06:26:13.100
Oh, my God, that's so cool.

06:26:13.100 --> 06:26:15.600
I can, like, go through here.

06:26:15.600 --> 06:26:19.400
Is there, like, a treasure chest or something?

06:26:19.400 --> 06:26:22.400
Or is this just, like, a hurry up?

06:26:22.400 --> 06:26:24.800
Oh, wait, that symbol.

06:26:24.800 --> 06:26:26.700
That means there's loot here?

06:26:26.700 --> 06:26:29.200
I don't see no loot.

06:26:29.200 --> 06:26:33.000
Or does it just mean that the thieves' guild was here?

06:26:36.200 --> 06:26:38.100
Huh?

06:26:38.100 --> 06:26:40.900
I'm so confused.

06:26:40.900 --> 06:26:43.700
I feel like there may have been something I missed,

06:26:43.700 --> 06:26:45.500
but hey-ho.

06:26:47.200 --> 06:26:48.100
All right, let's get to it.

06:26:48.100 --> 06:26:49.100
Everybody get to it.

06:26:49.100 --> 06:26:50.100
To it.

06:26:50.100 --> 06:26:51.100
Let's get this part.

06:26:51.100 --> 06:26:52.100
It started.

06:26:52.100 --> 06:26:54.500
Let's get the foam.

06:26:54.500 --> 06:26:56.600
Departed.

06:26:56.600 --> 06:26:58.000
Mercer was here.

06:26:58.000 --> 06:26:59.800
Shield one-handed is perfectly viable.

06:26:59.800 --> 06:27:00.600
Thank you very much.

06:27:00.600 --> 06:27:02.900
Probably.

06:27:02.900 --> 06:27:03.500
What do they hold?

06:27:03.500 --> 06:27:06.700
So they just kind of hold a lot of, like, mix and stuff.

06:27:06.700 --> 06:27:07.600
That's interesting.

06:27:07.600 --> 06:27:12.000
I guess a few were more into, like, the alchemy side of things.

06:27:12.000 --> 06:27:13.100
Oh, master a lot.

06:27:13.100 --> 06:27:15.700
Right, I'm not bothering.

06:27:15.700 --> 06:27:16.800
Saw his bot on your bike.

06:27:16.800 --> 06:27:18.100
Mm-hmm.

06:27:20.500 --> 06:27:22.100
Hydration check.

06:27:28.600 --> 06:27:29.900
Oh.

06:27:36.500 --> 06:27:38.000
Wow!

06:27:47.100 --> 06:27:48.900
Such a ship.

06:27:51.900 --> 06:27:52.800
Mm-hmm.

06:27:52.800 --> 06:27:55.100
Yeah, give me the key, Mercer.

06:27:59.000 --> 06:28:03.000
The water's rising.

06:28:12.000 --> 06:28:13.500
Uh...

06:28:15.500 --> 06:28:16.600
I don't believe you, no.

06:28:16.600 --> 06:28:18.000
Turtle gates me.

06:28:18.000 --> 06:28:20.000
My new friend leaking.

06:28:29.000 --> 06:28:31.300
Both of us lie, cheat, and steal.

06:28:31.300 --> 06:28:32.800
Oh!

06:28:32.800 --> 06:28:34.000
Dun, dun, dun.

06:28:34.000 --> 06:28:38.000
The difference is, I still have honor.

06:28:50.400 --> 06:28:54.800
If anyone falls, it'll be you, Mercer.

06:28:59.000 --> 06:29:02.000
Nightingale.

06:29:04.000 --> 06:29:09.000
Uh, I can't remember if this is hard or not.

06:29:09.000 --> 06:29:11.000
Oh, no, he got wallets.

06:29:11.000 --> 06:29:13.000
Oh, he's got blood drain.

06:29:15.000 --> 06:29:17.000
Oh, my God.

06:29:20.000 --> 06:29:21.000
Oh, where is he?

06:29:21.000 --> 06:29:22.000
I can just see the red doll.

06:29:22.000 --> 06:29:24.000
I'm chasing the red doll.

06:29:24.000 --> 06:29:25.000
I'm not even...

06:29:25.000 --> 06:29:26.000
There he is!

06:29:26.000 --> 06:29:27.000
I found him!

06:29:28.000 --> 06:29:29.000
Hello!

06:29:29.000 --> 06:29:30.000
Hello!

06:29:30.000 --> 06:29:32.000
I got him.

06:29:32.000 --> 06:29:33.000
He's got...

06:29:33.000 --> 06:29:34.000
Whoa, he's got like...

06:29:34.000 --> 06:29:35.000
Yeah, I'll take all that.

06:29:35.000 --> 06:29:37.000
Shit, give me everything.

06:29:37.000 --> 06:29:40.000
Oh, I'm carrying too much to be able to run.

06:29:40.000 --> 06:29:41.000
Uh...

06:29:41.000 --> 06:29:43.000
Oh, sorry, hold on.

06:29:43.000 --> 06:29:44.000
Sorry, excuse me.

06:29:44.000 --> 06:29:47.000
Just need to drop a few things that I don't need.

06:29:47.000 --> 06:29:49.000
I don't need an embalming tool.

06:29:49.000 --> 06:29:51.000
I can show you that much.

06:29:51.000 --> 06:29:54.000
Uh, don't need random chunks of ore.

06:29:54.000 --> 06:29:55.000
That's fine.

06:29:56.000 --> 06:29:57.000
A wall?

06:29:57.000 --> 06:29:58.000
It looks like a ship.

06:29:58.000 --> 06:30:00.000
Is that a tap?

06:30:01.000 --> 06:30:04.000
Yeah, don't need all these random miscellaneous things.

06:30:04.000 --> 06:30:05.000
That's fine.

06:30:05.000 --> 06:30:08.000
Ingredients that could probably eat all the little ones

06:30:08.000 --> 06:30:12.000
and clear up some side space stuff, I guess?

06:30:13.000 --> 06:30:15.000
Unknown, unknown.

06:30:15.000 --> 06:30:16.000
Sorry, guys.

06:30:16.000 --> 06:30:18.000
I know the cave is collapsing.

06:30:18.000 --> 06:30:20.000
It's very important I have a little taste test

06:30:20.000 --> 06:30:21.000
of all these ingredients.

06:30:21.000 --> 06:30:22.000
I assure you.

06:30:22.000 --> 06:30:23.000
Food?

06:30:23.000 --> 06:30:24.000
Yeah, sure.

06:30:24.000 --> 06:30:26.000
I'm just freaking loaded up.

06:30:26.000 --> 06:30:28.000
Am I light yet?

06:30:28.000 --> 06:30:29.000
No, I'm not light yet.

06:30:29.000 --> 06:30:30.000
Holy crap.

06:30:30.000 --> 06:30:31.000
Okay, uh, right.

06:30:31.000 --> 06:30:34.000
What do we not need?

06:30:34.000 --> 06:30:36.000
That does say 26, not gonna lie.

06:30:36.000 --> 06:30:39.000
Oh, I forgot to...

06:30:39.000 --> 06:30:41.000
That one's better.

06:30:41.000 --> 06:30:43.000
I don't want to, like, drop it, though.

06:30:43.000 --> 06:30:47.000
I feel like I can sell it for, like, decent money, honestly.

06:30:47.000 --> 06:30:49.000
Um...

06:30:49.000 --> 06:30:52.000
I guess we'll just drop that shit.

06:30:52.000 --> 06:30:55.000
Orcishbowl, 11, playing...

06:30:55.000 --> 06:30:57.000
These don't really give me much money.

06:30:58.000 --> 06:30:59.000
Okay.

06:30:59.000 --> 06:31:00.000
So don't panic.

06:31:00.000 --> 06:31:03.000
I know the cave is literally...

06:31:03.000 --> 06:31:04.000
Why is it...

06:31:04.000 --> 06:31:07.000
Oh, I know the cave is, like, perishing

06:31:07.000 --> 06:31:09.000
and it's falling with war.

06:31:09.000 --> 06:31:10.000
But don't panic, guys.

06:31:10.000 --> 06:31:12.000
Everything is okay, alright?

06:31:12.000 --> 06:31:14.000
You just have to let it fill.

06:31:14.000 --> 06:31:15.000
Oh.

06:31:15.000 --> 06:31:16.000
Oh, he...

06:31:16.000 --> 06:31:18.000
Oh, he hit the quad.

06:31:18.000 --> 06:31:19.000
The quad.

06:31:19.000 --> 06:31:20.000
Oh, are you guys okay?

06:31:20.000 --> 06:31:21.000
Do you guys need to breathe?

06:31:21.000 --> 06:31:22.000
No?

06:31:22.000 --> 06:31:23.000
No, you don't need to breathe?

06:31:23.000 --> 06:31:24.000
Okay.

06:31:24.000 --> 06:31:25.000
You don't have to.

06:31:25.000 --> 06:31:30.000
If you look above the head of the elf,

06:31:30.000 --> 06:31:36.000
you'll notice those rocks look very suspiciously movable.

06:31:36.000 --> 06:31:37.000
That's because they are.

06:31:37.000 --> 06:31:38.000
You have a keen eye.

06:31:38.000 --> 06:31:40.000
Refling, you have a keen eye.

06:31:42.000 --> 06:31:47.000
Strongly to taste test all the new alchemy ingredients.

06:31:47.000 --> 06:31:49.000
Literally, like, trying to, like, release.

06:31:49.000 --> 06:31:51.000
Some of the weight in my inventory.

06:31:51.000 --> 06:31:53.000
And I'm like, hmm, yes, hmm.

06:31:53.000 --> 06:31:55.000
This moth wing is the whole...

06:31:55.000 --> 06:31:57.000
What a delicacy.

06:31:57.000 --> 06:31:59.000
You just have to wait.

06:31:59.000 --> 06:32:01.000
Unfortunately, you can't, like, swim upwards.

06:32:01.000 --> 06:32:04.000
It doesn't do it the way you want it to.

06:32:04.000 --> 06:32:06.000
So it's a bit awkward.

06:32:06.000 --> 06:32:08.000
But yeah.

06:32:08.000 --> 06:32:11.000
I remember the first place where I was trying to, like,

06:32:11.000 --> 06:32:12.000
swim through these pipes.

06:32:12.000 --> 06:32:16.000
I was like, yes, the pipes, the pipes will save me.

06:32:16.000 --> 06:32:20.000
But it should do one big collapse.

06:32:20.000 --> 06:32:22.000
There you go.

06:32:22.000 --> 06:32:25.000
Take it long enough, honestly.

06:32:25.000 --> 06:32:31.000
And then you just gotta wait until it gets high enough to get up there.

06:32:31.000 --> 06:32:35.000
To shift the weight in my body eats 50 cheese wheels.

06:32:35.000 --> 06:32:36.000
We are aquatic.

06:32:36.000 --> 06:32:38.000
Let me eat some too.

06:32:38.000 --> 06:32:41.000
Stopping to release, yes, there.

06:32:41.000 --> 06:32:42.000
Hmm.

06:32:42.000 --> 06:32:44.000
But it's faster you get out of that cave

06:32:44.000 --> 06:32:46.000
the easier the game.

06:32:50.000 --> 06:32:51.000
Briff.

06:32:51.000 --> 06:32:52.000
Briff.

06:32:52.000 --> 06:32:55.000
I have completely forgotten how much the NPCs

06:32:55.000 --> 06:32:58.000
love to talk to you.

06:32:58.000 --> 06:33:00.000
Five, eight, nine.

06:33:02.000 --> 06:33:03.000
No!

06:33:03.000 --> 06:33:05.000
Carlisle!

06:33:09.000 --> 06:33:11.000
It's not simple.

06:33:15.000 --> 06:33:16.000
Sepucar.

06:33:16.000 --> 06:33:18.000
I've never said sepucar.

06:33:21.000 --> 06:33:24.000
Are you ready to take a pilgrimage together?

06:33:34.000 --> 06:33:37.000
Then we'd best get started.

06:33:44.000 --> 06:33:46.000
You need to protect the king.

06:33:46.000 --> 06:33:49.000
I'm afraid you'll have to face the end of your journey alone.

06:33:52.000 --> 06:33:53.000
Take this with you.

06:33:53.000 --> 06:33:56.000
I'm not certain if it will help within the walls of the sepucar.

06:33:56.000 --> 06:33:58.000
I've had this for the most time.

06:33:59.000 --> 06:34:01.000
And I haven't let me down.

06:34:01.000 --> 06:34:03.000
I hope it brings you the same path.

06:34:14.000 --> 06:34:16.000
I'll literally yank the HP off him.

06:34:17.000 --> 06:34:20.000
Can we serve Strony in other ways?

06:34:20.000 --> 06:34:21.000
Absolutely.

06:34:23.000 --> 06:34:26.000
It depends what your offering is to me.

06:34:28.000 --> 06:34:31.000
Aw, I've not even been a folk wreath yet!

06:34:34.000 --> 06:34:36.000
Actually, you know what?

06:34:36.000 --> 06:34:40.000
I need to destroy and enchant a few things to sell on.

06:34:40.000 --> 06:34:43.000
So I'm gonna go do that now and it will free up a lot of inventory.

06:34:44.000 --> 06:34:46.000
Is Carlaya the same VA as Shadowheart?

06:34:46.000 --> 06:34:47.000
I cannot tell you that.

06:34:47.000 --> 06:34:48.000
I don't know.

06:34:49.000 --> 06:34:51.000
Baldur's Gate is such a good review, though,

06:34:51.000 --> 06:34:54.000
that I'm really tempted to play it for the first time on stream.

06:34:55.000 --> 06:34:58.000
I'm worried in case I'm so dumb I can't figure it out,

06:34:58.000 --> 06:35:00.000
but hopefully it's a full-proof game.

06:35:00.000 --> 06:35:02.000
Anyone can just jump in on the fun.

06:35:02.000 --> 06:35:04.000
This is what I want.

06:35:05.000 --> 06:35:08.000
Devouring, archery, and potions.

06:35:08.000 --> 06:35:10.000
Everything else can be sold.

06:35:10.000 --> 06:35:12.000
You heard it here first.

06:35:15.000 --> 06:35:17.000
Did I even have a big gem?

06:35:18.000 --> 06:35:19.000
I do!

06:35:20.000 --> 06:35:21.000
Yes!

06:35:22.000 --> 06:35:23.000
Did I make it craft?

06:35:23.000 --> 06:35:24.000
Yes!

06:35:25.000 --> 06:35:27.000
That was bloody good shoo.

06:35:27.000 --> 06:35:29.000
That bloody good shoo.

06:35:29.000 --> 06:35:30.000
Right, where's that?

06:35:30.000 --> 06:35:31.000
Okay.

06:35:32.000 --> 06:35:36.000
So what? Just enchant random stuff now for the XP, I guess?

06:35:37.000 --> 06:35:38.000
Turn Undead.

06:35:38.000 --> 06:35:40.000
Frost Damage, here, why not?

06:35:40.000 --> 06:35:41.000
Petty Soul Gem.

06:35:41.000 --> 06:35:44.000
Yeah, I'm just going to put Petty Soul Gem stuff on it.

06:35:47.000 --> 06:35:51.000
And then I know I can sell everything in my inventory.

06:35:51.000 --> 06:35:54.000
God, look at the level up is so fast.

06:35:55.000 --> 06:35:57.000
This game is so forgiving.

06:36:02.000 --> 06:36:03.000
Just the noise.

06:36:05.000 --> 06:36:07.000
It's just constantly like...

06:36:08.000 --> 06:36:11.000
We'll put all of this stuff on.

06:36:11.000 --> 06:36:13.000
And then we can get a pretty penny.

06:36:13.000 --> 06:36:15.000
Oh, we might be able to buy the home.

06:36:15.000 --> 06:36:18.000
We might be able to buy our home in Riften.

06:36:19.000 --> 06:36:23.000
And then we can have our little flower garden out in front.

06:36:24.000 --> 06:36:26.000
We can't get chickens though.

06:36:26.000 --> 06:36:27.000
Not yet.

06:36:27.000 --> 06:36:30.000
Baldur's Gate 3 is good and you can do whatever you want.

06:36:30.000 --> 06:36:32.000
It's not really wrong way of playing it.

06:36:32.000 --> 06:36:34.000
Baldur's Gate is really open and rewarding.

06:36:34.000 --> 06:36:35.000
I'm glad.

06:36:38.000 --> 06:36:39.000
Um...

06:36:42.000 --> 06:36:43.000
I can't figure it out.

06:36:43.000 --> 06:36:46.000
Also, it tells us, please backseat me.

06:36:46.000 --> 06:36:47.000
You'll be fine.

06:36:48.000 --> 06:36:52.000
Yeah, some folk really are so strongly like a little bit backseat gaming.

06:36:52.000 --> 06:36:56.000
I'm actually going to travel to Riften just to sell some stuff

06:36:56.000 --> 06:36:58.000
because my inventory is getting a bit too full.

06:36:59.000 --> 06:37:04.000
Now, as much as I like being full and, you know, a bandaid slapped on top.

06:37:04.000 --> 06:37:05.000
Not like this.

06:37:05.000 --> 06:37:06.000
What is this?

06:37:11.000 --> 06:37:12.000
You!

06:37:14.000 --> 06:37:18.000
I would like to sell some weapons that are very heavy.

06:37:21.000 --> 06:37:22.000
I will keep children.

06:37:22.000 --> 06:37:24.000
I'll put it elsewhere.

06:37:28.000 --> 06:37:30.000
I don't want to sell that stuff.

06:37:30.000 --> 06:37:33.000
I'd rather keep it in the prowl.

06:37:33.000 --> 06:37:36.000
I can sell, like, all of it right here at Money's.

06:37:39.000 --> 06:37:40.000
I will remember that.

06:37:43.000 --> 06:37:45.000
You can marry the butcher.

06:37:45.000 --> 06:37:46.000
He's not butcher.

06:37:46.000 --> 06:37:48.000
He's a blacksmith making all that.

06:37:48.000 --> 06:37:50.000
Those wires are really crossed on me.

06:37:50.000 --> 06:37:51.000
Please take...

06:37:53.000 --> 06:37:56.000
Please take some of my stuff that I don't need.

06:37:57.000 --> 06:37:58.000
Thanks. Appreciate it.

06:37:59.000 --> 06:38:02.000
Created potions are 1% more per...

06:38:02.000 --> 06:38:06.000
Wait, no, actually, I'm going to keep the diamonds and stuff on me.

06:38:06.000 --> 06:38:10.000
The reason for that is because you can get, like,

06:38:10.000 --> 06:38:12.000
Miscellaneous Quest to ask for that basic stuff.

06:38:12.000 --> 06:38:13.000
How about you?

06:38:16.000 --> 06:38:18.000
Everything I've got on display, really.

06:38:19.000 --> 06:38:20.000
We're going to get rid of all this.

06:38:20.000 --> 06:38:22.000
This should really lighten the load.

06:38:24.000 --> 06:38:26.000
I don't want to sell that thing.

06:38:26.000 --> 06:38:29.000
Oh, I completely forgot I had, like, all those...

06:38:32.000 --> 06:38:33.000
That must...

06:38:33.000 --> 06:38:35.000
Oh, he's not going to go left.

06:38:35.000 --> 06:38:36.000
Oops.

06:38:36.000 --> 06:38:37.000
Oops, I'm giving away things for free.

06:38:37.000 --> 06:38:38.000
Oopsies.

06:38:38.000 --> 06:38:39.000
Oopsies.

06:38:39.000 --> 06:38:40.000
Teehee.

06:38:40.000 --> 06:38:41.000
Little teehee moment.

06:38:41.000 --> 06:38:44.000
Right, we'll go Falkreath and then we'll hit up Twilight's...

06:38:44.000 --> 06:38:45.000
La-la-la-la-la.

06:38:46.000 --> 06:38:48.000
Strangely, I will remember everything you said.

06:38:48.000 --> 06:38:49.000
Bear, no.

06:38:49.000 --> 06:38:51.000
I even don't want to say half the time.

06:38:51.000 --> 06:38:52.000
I'm just here for a good time.

06:38:52.000 --> 06:38:55.000
Do you remember when we almost got our head chopped off?

06:38:55.000 --> 06:38:58.000
Yeah, and I was taken over by bandits and burnt to a crisp.

06:38:58.000 --> 06:38:59.000
Teehee, not my problem.

06:38:59.000 --> 06:39:00.000
Teehee.

06:39:02.000 --> 06:39:07.000
Strangely, Ever dropped a bunch of jewelry in the shopping centre in Riften.

06:39:07.000 --> 06:39:10.000
Everyone starts fighting over stuff you drop,

06:39:10.000 --> 06:39:13.000
and, like, it literally terminates NPCs,

06:39:13.000 --> 06:39:14.000
and it's, like, the proof.

06:39:14.000 --> 06:39:16.000
I've need them for quests.

06:39:16.000 --> 06:39:20.000
That's the one thing I could absolutely obliterate Skyrim for,

06:39:20.000 --> 06:39:24.000
is if a quest requires an NPC,

06:39:24.000 --> 06:39:27.000
do not let them be perishable.

06:39:27.000 --> 06:39:29.000
Do not let them expire.

06:39:29.000 --> 06:39:31.000
I am so sad.

06:39:31.000 --> 06:39:33.000
What the heck is...

06:39:33.000 --> 06:39:36.000
Oh, no!

06:39:38.000 --> 06:39:41.000
The wolves jump these poor people,

06:39:41.000 --> 06:39:44.000
and the one wolf perished them both.

06:39:48.000 --> 06:39:51.000
That's what you get for trying to execute an innocent dragonborn.

06:39:52.000 --> 06:39:54.000
Some of them are marchers.

06:39:54.000 --> 06:39:57.000
Yeah, like, some NPCs can't be perishable,

06:39:57.000 --> 06:39:59.000
but if they have a quest,

06:39:59.000 --> 06:40:01.000
I feel like they shouldn't be able to expire at all,

06:40:01.000 --> 06:40:04.000
because it's so annoying when you're, like, trying to do it,

06:40:04.000 --> 06:40:06.000
and then it's, like, all surprised, by the way.

06:40:06.000 --> 06:40:07.000
Oh, who are you?

06:40:07.000 --> 06:40:08.000
Hello.

06:40:13.000 --> 06:40:15.000
Mummy, Goo Goo Gaga Azura.

06:40:16.000 --> 06:40:17.000
Mummy.

06:40:17.000 --> 06:40:19.000
Any mummies.

06:40:20.000 --> 06:40:22.000
We'll make it a little tea break.

06:40:22.000 --> 06:40:23.000
A little tea break?

06:40:23.000 --> 06:40:24.000
Is that allowed?

06:40:24.000 --> 06:40:26.000
Is that permitted?

06:40:28.000 --> 06:40:32.000
And then I'm going to get a wee snack as well.

06:40:34.000 --> 06:40:37.000
A bit of a little cup of tea, a little bit of water.

06:40:39.000 --> 06:40:44.000
Yeah, I'm starting to think we're getting, like, absolutely nothing done.

06:40:44.000 --> 06:40:47.000
We're pretty much looking at T-minus two hours.

06:40:47.000 --> 06:40:49.000
I've been live for almost seven hours.

06:40:49.000 --> 06:40:51.000
I've yet to finish the quest.

06:40:52.000 --> 06:40:54.000
Right, fault creases here.

06:40:56.000 --> 06:40:58.000
What the heck is that?

06:41:00.000 --> 06:41:03.000
Bro, you cannot drop rocks on people's heads.

06:41:03.000 --> 06:41:06.000
I cannot tell you how inappropriate that is.

06:41:09.000 --> 06:41:12.000
I am home with my mummy.

06:41:12.000 --> 06:41:15.000
We drink milk and tea up in this place, of course.

06:41:18.000 --> 06:41:21.000
Literally, how have I been at this for seven hours?

06:41:21.000 --> 06:41:22.000
I'm not completed one quest.

06:41:22.000 --> 06:41:23.000
Something's not adding up.

06:41:23.000 --> 06:41:24.000
I don't know.

06:41:24.000 --> 06:41:29.000
Like, I'm pretty sure the Skyrim World record is, like, two hours.

06:41:29.000 --> 06:41:32.000
Like, one hour and 52 minutes or something.

06:41:32.000 --> 06:41:33.000
Ridiculous like that.

06:41:33.000 --> 06:41:40.000
And you're telling me in seven hours, near seven hours, I couldn't finish one quest line.

06:41:42.000 --> 06:41:43.000
Well, I need sleep.

06:41:43.000 --> 06:41:44.000
Good night.

06:41:44.000 --> 06:41:45.000
Thank you for hanging.

06:41:45.000 --> 06:41:46.000
No promises.

06:41:46.000 --> 06:41:47.000
I won't see you in my dreams.

06:41:47.000 --> 06:41:48.000
That's right.

06:41:48.000 --> 06:41:49.000
Get Scottish.

06:41:49.000 --> 06:41:50.000
Get Scottish.

06:41:50.000 --> 06:41:51.000
Get Scottish.

06:41:51.000 --> 06:41:54.000
Your only dream of a Scottish.

06:41:54.000 --> 06:41:56.000
The Highland Cows call you.

06:41:59.000 --> 06:42:02.000
Ooh, I don't want to walk over a grave.

06:42:02.000 --> 06:42:04.000
That's bad luck.

06:42:04.000 --> 06:42:05.000
There's a lot of graves.

06:42:05.000 --> 06:42:07.000
What's going on in fault grief?

06:42:07.000 --> 06:42:11.000
I feel like that's probably a quest, because that's a lot.

06:42:11.000 --> 06:42:14.000
Scotland, forever.

06:42:16.000 --> 06:42:18.000
A little tricky thing.

06:42:18.000 --> 06:42:19.000
Get Scottish.

06:42:19.000 --> 06:42:20.000
Get Scottish.

06:42:20.000 --> 06:42:21.000
Get Scottish.

06:42:21.000 --> 06:42:22.000
I think I need to do that.

06:42:22.000 --> 06:42:24.000
Someone did that where it was like, get pregnant, get pregnant, get pregnant.

06:42:24.000 --> 06:42:26.000
And it's like, do you didn't see it?

06:42:26.000 --> 06:42:27.000
Like, really intense music.

06:42:27.000 --> 06:42:29.000
I want to do that, but like, get Scottish.

06:42:29.000 --> 06:42:30.000
Get Scottish.

06:42:30.000 --> 06:42:31.000
Get Scottish.

06:42:34.000 --> 06:42:35.000
We're almost there.

06:42:35.000 --> 06:42:36.000
We're almost there.

06:42:36.000 --> 06:42:37.000
We're almost there.

06:42:37.000 --> 06:42:40.000
We're just going to run a little bit longer.

06:42:41.000 --> 06:42:45.000
Oh, there's castles and ruins.

06:42:45.000 --> 06:42:49.000
Did you know you can just straight up buy castles in Scotland?

06:42:49.000 --> 06:42:51.000
Fun fact, you can literally look up them online.

06:42:51.000 --> 06:42:53.000
Just type in Castle for sale in Scotland.

06:42:53.000 --> 06:42:56.000
I'm not even kidding.

06:42:56.000 --> 06:42:59.000
It's pretty intense and cool.

06:42:59.000 --> 06:43:01.000
And you can buy churches.

06:43:01.000 --> 06:43:05.000
It's a lot cheaper to live in a church, an ex-church, by the way.

06:43:05.000 --> 06:43:08.000
You can literally, it's like churches for sale in Scotland.

06:43:08.000 --> 06:43:09.000
Yeah.

06:43:09.000 --> 06:43:10.000
Just have a look.

06:43:10.000 --> 06:43:11.000
It's like way cheaper.

06:43:14.000 --> 06:43:18.000
Shawnee, have you heard of the Scott Wikipedia vandalism story?

06:43:18.000 --> 06:43:19.000
Yes.

06:43:19.000 --> 06:43:21.000
Oh, we should talk about it.

06:43:21.000 --> 06:43:26.000
Like, if you didn't know, so Scots is basically slang.

06:43:26.000 --> 06:43:29.000
And we say things very phonetically.

06:43:29.000 --> 06:43:35.000
And someone, whoa, I didn't realize you were a bandit.

06:43:35.000 --> 06:43:36.000
Sorry.

06:43:36.000 --> 06:43:39.000
Time to go, buddy.

06:43:39.000 --> 06:43:40.000
Okay.

06:43:40.000 --> 06:43:46.000
And someone basically went, oh, I'll just rewrite this in Scots.

06:43:46.000 --> 06:43:49.000
But he, like, wasn't Scottish.

06:43:49.000 --> 06:43:53.000
So he just wrote what he thought, like, Scottish folks said.

06:43:53.000 --> 06:43:55.000
And it was just complete gibberish.

06:43:55.000 --> 06:43:59.000
And he'd been doing it for ages and no one, like, caught him.

06:43:59.000 --> 06:44:01.000
Wasn't that it?

06:44:01.000 --> 06:44:07.000
He said in Zillow, Scotland to find an affordable hoose, honestly.

06:44:07.000 --> 06:44:09.000
It's Gallus.

06:44:09.000 --> 06:44:10.000
Hello.

06:44:10.000 --> 06:44:12.000
Hello, Gallus.

06:44:19.000 --> 06:44:20.000
I visited Edinburgh.

06:44:20.000 --> 06:44:21.000
Let's go.

06:44:21.000 --> 06:44:24.000
I'd ask the same question with you.

06:44:24.000 --> 06:44:26.000
It's really funny.

06:44:26.000 --> 06:44:29.000
Shawnee's going to buy a castle, move the wheel or team into it,

06:44:29.000 --> 06:44:31.000
reference to serve them there.

06:44:31.000 --> 06:44:33.000
But could you imagine, though?

06:44:33.000 --> 06:44:37.000
Like, oh, you know what, you get out of this exchange?

06:44:37.000 --> 06:44:39.000
I servited.

06:44:42.000 --> 06:44:45.000
How are you to blame?

06:44:51.000 --> 06:44:53.000
Where can I say not?

06:44:56.000 --> 06:44:58.000
Wait a minute, you're Gallus.

06:44:59.000 --> 06:45:03.000
I've heard that name in a long, long time.

06:45:03.000 --> 06:45:05.000
How do you know of me?

06:45:05.000 --> 06:45:08.000
I'm best pals with your girlfriend.

06:45:08.000 --> 06:45:09.000
The key.

06:45:09.000 --> 06:45:11.000
You have the skeleton key.

06:45:11.000 --> 06:45:14.000
I never thought I'd see it again.

06:45:14.000 --> 06:45:16.000
How do you say I love you in Scottish?

06:45:16.000 --> 06:45:19.000
It's just I love you.

06:45:19.000 --> 06:45:24.000
Like, I love you, and then I love you.

06:45:24.000 --> 06:45:27.000
It's kind of, like, shoved together in fast.

06:45:27.000 --> 06:45:29.000
He's that adoring fan.

06:45:29.000 --> 06:45:31.000
Is he?

06:45:31.000 --> 06:45:33.000
Biazura, Biazura, Biazura.

06:45:33.000 --> 06:45:34.000
I did this for Nektoro.

06:45:34.000 --> 06:45:36.000
I did this for the owner of the guild.

06:45:42.000 --> 06:45:44.000
Carlaya helped me.

06:45:46.000 --> 06:45:48.000
Yes, your girlfriend's alive.

06:45:54.000 --> 06:45:56.000
Well, then she would have appeared here.

06:45:56.000 --> 06:45:58.000
Then take the key and right all the wrongs.

06:46:04.000 --> 06:46:06.000
When we put the strongens or cult leader,

06:46:06.000 --> 06:46:08.000
we could cut taxes and save money.

06:46:08.000 --> 06:46:09.000
Yay!

06:46:11.000 --> 06:46:13.000
We can be tax exempt together.

06:46:13.000 --> 06:46:14.000
Yippee!

06:46:15.000 --> 06:46:17.000
How can I, how can a spirit die?

06:46:17.000 --> 06:46:19.000
The sepulchre isn't nearly a temple

06:46:19.000 --> 06:46:21.000
or a vault to house the key.

06:46:21.000 --> 06:46:25.000
Within these walls is the ebony.

06:46:25.000 --> 06:46:26.000
The ebony?

06:46:26.000 --> 06:46:28.000
A bit of an ebony.

06:46:30.000 --> 06:46:32.000
When Mercer stole the key,

06:46:32.000 --> 06:46:34.000
that conduit closed,

06:46:34.000 --> 06:46:35.000
severely limiting our...

06:46:35.000 --> 06:46:37.000
Maintaining a historical site

06:46:37.000 --> 06:46:39.000
for tax breaks and profit?

06:46:39.000 --> 06:46:40.000
Yeah!

06:46:40.000 --> 06:46:42.000
And then we run, like, a massive B&B over.

06:46:42.000 --> 06:46:43.000
Oh, my God.

06:46:43.000 --> 06:46:44.000
Oh!

06:46:44.000 --> 06:46:46.000
I'm afraid so.

06:46:46.000 --> 06:46:47.000
I'm weakening.

06:46:47.000 --> 06:46:50.000
And I can feel myself slipping away.

06:46:50.000 --> 06:46:52.000
The years without restoration of my power

06:46:52.000 --> 06:46:54.000
I had taken their toll.

06:46:54.000 --> 06:46:56.000
You really want to mess with the IRS?

06:46:56.000 --> 06:46:58.000
That should be a song.

06:46:58.000 --> 06:47:00.000
You really want to mess with the IRS?

06:47:02.000 --> 06:47:05.000
I fought the law in the law one.

06:47:06.000 --> 06:47:07.000
Ray.

06:47:07.000 --> 06:47:08.000
I will go.

06:47:09.000 --> 06:47:10.000
Good luck, Gallus.

06:47:10.000 --> 06:47:12.000
Even if you don't have to do anything,

06:47:12.000 --> 06:47:13.000
that's okay, I'll do it all.

06:47:13.000 --> 06:47:15.000
I don't mind doing the hard work, right?

06:47:15.000 --> 06:47:16.000
Who needs a bastion?

06:47:17.000 --> 06:47:18.000
Who needs a bastion?

06:47:18.000 --> 06:47:19.000
Who's begging for the pagan?

06:47:19.000 --> 06:47:21.000
Because it's all happening at once.

06:47:21.000 --> 06:47:22.000
Let's go!

06:47:22.000 --> 06:47:23.000
I bet he do.

06:47:23.000 --> 06:47:25.000
Beat him up, beat him up, beat him up!

06:47:25.000 --> 06:47:26.000
Beat him up!

06:47:26.000 --> 06:47:27.000
Ay! Ay! Ay!

06:47:27.000 --> 06:47:28.000
Oh, wow.

06:47:28.000 --> 06:47:30.000
They're actually kind of beef.

06:47:30.000 --> 06:47:32.000
They're actually a bit stronger

06:47:32.000 --> 06:47:33.000
than your average enemy.

06:47:33.000 --> 06:47:34.000
Hold on a minute.

06:47:34.000 --> 06:47:35.000
I don't like that.

06:47:35.000 --> 06:47:36.000
Where's...

06:47:36.000 --> 06:47:37.000
You, come here.

06:47:37.000 --> 06:47:38.000
No.

06:47:38.000 --> 06:47:39.000
I'm stuck on the stairs.

06:47:39.000 --> 06:47:40.000
Hold on.

06:47:41.000 --> 06:47:42.000
I'm stuck on...

06:47:42.000 --> 06:47:43.000
Ow! Ow!

06:47:43.000 --> 06:47:44.000
Stop!

06:47:44.000 --> 06:47:45.000
Swap to weapon, Ray!

06:47:45.000 --> 06:47:46.000
Stop to melee!

06:47:46.000 --> 06:47:47.000
Yes, there you go.

06:47:47.000 --> 06:47:48.000
Okay, there we go.

06:47:49.000 --> 06:47:50.000
Jeez, I lose.

06:47:51.000 --> 06:47:52.000
What is in you?

06:47:53.000 --> 06:47:54.000
Arrows?

06:47:55.000 --> 06:47:56.000
So, Gem!

06:47:57.000 --> 06:47:58.000
Alchemy!

06:48:00.000 --> 06:48:02.000
Totally not secret,

06:48:02.000 --> 06:48:03.000
backtracking.

06:48:04.000 --> 06:48:05.000
I do love Skyrim for that.

06:48:05.000 --> 06:48:06.000
It's quite...

06:48:06.000 --> 06:48:07.000
It's quite rather entertaining.

06:48:08.000 --> 06:48:09.000
Okay, they've got elven arrows

06:48:09.000 --> 06:48:10.000
on their persons,

06:48:10.000 --> 06:48:11.000
which is pretty...

06:48:11.000 --> 06:48:12.000
Ugh.

06:48:15.000 --> 06:48:17.000
Whoa, why are you so scary?

06:48:20.000 --> 06:48:21.000
I'm not gonna lie.

06:48:21.000 --> 06:48:23.000
Like, they're kind of messing me up now.

06:48:24.000 --> 06:48:26.000
Open our own velar colony?

06:48:27.000 --> 06:48:28.000
What?

06:48:28.000 --> 06:48:30.000
In the Scottish countryside with crops

06:48:30.000 --> 06:48:32.000
and feudal lordship for the growth?

06:48:33.000 --> 06:48:34.000
Bruh.

06:48:36.000 --> 06:48:37.000
Look, sometimes a sense of community

06:48:37.000 --> 06:48:38.000
is all you need.

06:48:38.000 --> 06:48:40.000
Wait, I'm to stay in the dark.

06:48:42.000 --> 06:48:44.000
Right, if you stay in the dark,

06:48:44.000 --> 06:48:45.000
your health doesn't get...

06:48:48.000 --> 06:48:50.000
Well, wasn't paying attention to that.

06:48:50.000 --> 06:48:51.000
Was I?

06:48:51.000 --> 06:48:52.000
Clearly, no?

06:48:53.000 --> 06:48:55.000
Uh, yeah, you just need to stay in the dark

06:48:55.000 --> 06:48:56.000
so you don't get hurt in this section.

06:48:56.000 --> 06:48:58.000
It's not really too bad at all.

06:48:58.000 --> 06:49:00.000
I just can't see nothing in it at all.

06:49:01.000 --> 06:49:02.000
Oh!

06:49:02.000 --> 06:49:04.000
It's just a wee bit of poison.

06:49:04.000 --> 06:49:05.000
Just a few darts in my eyeballs.

06:49:05.000 --> 06:49:06.000
It's fine, it's fine.

06:49:06.000 --> 06:49:08.000
I can still see for the most part.

06:49:08.000 --> 06:49:09.000
Hee hee.

06:49:09.000 --> 06:49:11.000
I wish I wore my glasses.

06:49:12.000 --> 06:49:13.000
Ah, we did it!

06:49:13.000 --> 06:49:14.000
Hey!

06:49:14.000 --> 06:49:15.000
Woo!

06:49:15.000 --> 06:49:16.000
Let's go.

06:49:16.000 --> 06:49:17.000
What's this?

06:49:17.000 --> 06:49:18.000
Ah!

06:49:18.000 --> 06:49:20.000
My lady!

06:49:20.000 --> 06:49:21.000
Hello!

06:49:23.000 --> 06:49:24.000
Oh!

06:49:24.000 --> 06:49:26.000
A bandit got all the way here.

06:49:27.000 --> 06:49:28.000
Hello, my lady.

06:49:28.000 --> 06:49:30.000
Please ignore the fact that I'm taking your offering.

06:49:30.000 --> 06:49:32.000
So fragmented, I don't need that.

06:49:33.000 --> 06:49:36.000
Uh, uh, behind here is two chains to pull.

06:49:37.000 --> 06:49:38.000
Gammy!

06:49:40.000 --> 06:49:41.000
Atlas!

06:49:42.000 --> 06:49:43.000
Where's Blossom?

06:49:44.000 --> 06:49:45.000
Where's Gammy?

06:49:45.000 --> 06:49:47.000
That's Gammy, the girl.

06:49:47.000 --> 06:49:49.000
And that's her dad, Atlas.

06:49:49.000 --> 06:49:51.000
And Blossom's her mummy.

06:49:53.000 --> 06:49:54.000
Hmm.

06:49:54.000 --> 06:49:56.000
Is it true if you buy Landon Scott, you become a lord?

06:49:56.000 --> 06:49:58.000
No, that is completely false.

06:49:58.000 --> 06:50:02.000
Um, if you take that in, by the way,

06:50:02.000 --> 06:50:03.000
you'll actually...

06:50:03.000 --> 06:50:04.000
What on earth?

06:50:05.000 --> 06:50:06.000
Um...

06:50:09.000 --> 06:50:10.000
Hello!

06:50:11.000 --> 06:50:12.000
Ow!

06:50:12.000 --> 06:50:14.000
Oh my god, I just got reeled by a log.

06:50:14.000 --> 06:50:16.000
That wasn't really that fun, I'm gonna be honest.

06:50:18.000 --> 06:50:19.000
Right, we did it.

06:50:19.000 --> 06:50:20.000
We did it.

06:50:20.000 --> 06:50:21.000
We're here, we're here.

06:50:21.000 --> 06:50:23.000
Snowberry's waiting on Aces every need.

06:50:23.000 --> 06:50:25.000
Penpal's being picked for a set of me.

06:50:28.000 --> 06:50:31.000
Oh, it's all spooky, it's all spooky and purple.

06:50:32.000 --> 06:50:35.000
Oh, I love the color scheme.

06:50:37.000 --> 06:50:39.000
Oh, I remember this.

06:50:42.000 --> 06:50:44.000
Oh no, I'm stuck.

06:50:46.000 --> 06:50:47.000
I should read his note.

06:50:48.000 --> 06:50:50.000
Anderson's, Andrew's message.

06:50:50.000 --> 06:50:52.000
I can't believe it, I came all this way,

06:50:52.000 --> 06:50:54.000
solved all of those ridiculous riddles,

06:50:54.000 --> 06:50:55.000
just to end up here.

06:50:55.000 --> 06:50:58.000
After I memorized Nystrom's clues,

06:50:58.000 --> 06:51:00.000
he'd collected from Letheus,

06:51:00.000 --> 06:51:01.000
isolate his throat.

06:51:01.000 --> 06:51:02.000
Now I guess the joke's on me,

06:51:02.000 --> 06:51:04.000
because I'm stuck here and I don't see a way out.

06:51:04.000 --> 06:51:06.000
Hope someone comes by soon, I'm getting hungry.

06:51:06.000 --> 06:51:08.000
I don't think he made it, chief.

06:51:08.000 --> 06:51:10.000
I don't think he made it.

06:51:10.000 --> 06:51:11.000
Yeah.

06:51:14.000 --> 06:51:16.000
If only we had some sort of...

06:51:17.000 --> 06:51:18.000
key?

06:51:19.000 --> 06:51:22.000
Some sort of skeleton...

06:51:22.000 --> 06:51:23.000
key?

06:51:24.000 --> 06:51:25.000
Yep.

06:51:28.000 --> 06:51:29.000
Oh.

06:51:39.000 --> 06:51:40.000
Oh, I'm stuck.

06:51:40.000 --> 06:51:41.000
What have we got?

06:51:46.000 --> 06:51:47.000
Oh, yes.

06:51:48.000 --> 06:51:49.000
Gammys!

06:51:49.000 --> 06:51:50.000
Look at all Gammys babies!

06:51:50.000 --> 06:51:52.000
Oh, I'm the wrong way, sorry Hen.

06:51:58.000 --> 06:52:00.000
Tell me that ain't good design.

06:52:02.000 --> 06:52:04.000
Excuse me, will Stylical around?

06:52:06.000 --> 06:52:07.000
Oh, yeah.

06:52:09.000 --> 06:52:10.000
Oh, yeah.

06:52:17.000 --> 06:52:18.000
Oh, yeah.

06:52:29.000 --> 06:52:32.000
Nothing more than the fulfillment of your agreement.

06:52:34.000 --> 06:52:36.000
We must stay focused, Reeflings.

06:52:36.000 --> 06:52:38.000
We must stay focused.

06:52:59.000 --> 06:53:04.000
I wish you to drink deeply from the Evermere mortal.

06:53:04.000 --> 06:53:08.000
Or this is where the agent of Nocturnal is born.

06:53:09.000 --> 06:53:10.000
Drink?

06:53:10.000 --> 06:53:12.000
The oath has been strong.

06:53:12.000 --> 06:53:14.000
The die has been cast.

06:53:14.000 --> 06:53:17.000
And your fate awaits you in the Everglow.

06:53:20.000 --> 06:53:22.000
Bye-bye, Mommy!

06:53:28.000 --> 06:53:30.000
What? Where did you come from?

06:53:30.000 --> 06:53:31.000
Hello?

06:53:32.000 --> 06:53:33.000
Sorry.

06:53:33.000 --> 06:53:34.000
Oh, sorry.

06:53:35.000 --> 06:53:36.000
Oh, sorry.

06:53:36.000 --> 06:53:37.000
Can I talk to you now?

06:53:40.000 --> 06:53:41.000
Yes.

06:53:44.000 --> 06:53:46.000
Uh, please, she sounded indifferent.

06:53:59.000 --> 06:54:02.000
I assure you that she'd been displeased with you.

06:54:02.000 --> 06:54:04.000
We wouldn't be having this conversation.

06:54:06.000 --> 06:54:09.000
What's this about becoming an agent and a Nocturnal?

06:54:14.000 --> 06:54:17.000
The crescent moon represents the agent of shadow.

06:54:17.000 --> 06:54:20.000
The crescent moon, I think, is what we want.

06:54:20.000 --> 06:54:23.000
In the full moon, for the agent of strife.

06:54:24.000 --> 06:54:27.000
This is Nocturnal's role in maintaining balance.

06:54:28.000 --> 06:54:32.000
How is this goddess of stealth when it's clear?

06:54:33.000 --> 06:54:35.000
With the clap of her cheeks,

06:54:35.000 --> 06:54:38.000
we'd alarm the guards on a 500 meter radius.

06:54:40.000 --> 06:54:41.000
It's unfamiliar.

06:54:41.000 --> 06:54:43.000
Her hotness is so powerful.

06:54:48.000 --> 06:54:49.000
And you?

06:54:52.000 --> 06:54:53.000
Aww.

06:54:53.000 --> 06:54:54.000
Aww.

06:54:56.000 --> 06:54:57.000
The beginning of what?

06:55:05.000 --> 06:55:06.000
Wow.

06:55:11.000 --> 06:55:13.000
We're down good at what we do.

06:55:15.000 --> 06:55:16.000
Uh, I think stealth.

06:55:16.000 --> 06:55:18.000
Tell me where the crescent moon.

06:55:18.000 --> 06:55:20.000
Is the most on moonlit nights.

06:55:21.000 --> 06:55:22.000
Yeah, okay.

06:55:22.000 --> 06:55:24.000
Well, you do the agent of...

06:55:25.000 --> 06:55:27.000
Are you a crescent moon?

06:55:27.000 --> 06:55:28.000
You're a full moon.

06:55:29.000 --> 06:55:30.000
And you're a half moon.

06:55:30.000 --> 06:55:31.000
Okay, crescent moon.

06:55:33.000 --> 06:55:34.000
Okay, now what?

06:55:35.000 --> 06:55:37.000
Oh no, Gallus is about to come.

06:55:40.000 --> 06:55:43.000
Ooh, look, it's Gallus and Carnaia.

06:55:44.000 --> 06:55:45.000
They're gonna kiss.

06:55:49.000 --> 06:55:51.000
I was afraid she'd become like the others.

06:55:52.000 --> 06:55:55.000
If it were not for the actions of this Nightingale,

06:55:55.000 --> 06:55:57.000
she and his would have come true.

06:55:58.000 --> 06:56:00.000
She would have lost all hope.

06:56:04.000 --> 06:56:06.000
Nocturnal calls me to the Everglow.

06:56:07.000 --> 06:56:09.000
My contract has been fulfilled.

06:56:11.000 --> 06:56:13.000
Will I ever see you again?

06:56:13.000 --> 06:56:16.000
When your debt to Nocturnal has been paid,

06:56:17.000 --> 06:56:19.000
we'll embrace what's ahead.

06:56:20.000 --> 06:56:22.000
How well, Gallus.

06:56:23.000 --> 06:56:24.000
Eyes open.

06:56:25.000 --> 06:56:26.000
Walk with the shadows.

06:56:26.000 --> 06:56:28.000
I've been 25 years since you've seen each other,

06:56:28.000 --> 06:56:29.000
and this is it.

06:56:29.000 --> 06:56:30.000
This is what they muster.

06:56:31.000 --> 06:56:33.000
Are you alright, Carla?

06:56:33.000 --> 06:56:34.000
Maybe it's just not...

06:56:34.000 --> 06:56:35.000
She doesn't understand.

06:56:37.000 --> 06:56:39.000
Oh, he's going to disappear into the bowl of soup.

06:56:39.000 --> 06:56:40.000
Oh, he's in the bowl of soup, lads.

06:56:41.000 --> 06:56:43.000
Sorry, I'm sure it's really emotional.

06:56:44.000 --> 06:56:45.000
What is it?

06:56:45.000 --> 06:56:47.000
He appeared at Gallus' school in our bowl of soup.

06:56:50.000 --> 06:56:52.000
The spirit becomes one with the Everglow.

06:56:56.000 --> 06:56:57.000
Ah.

06:56:57.000 --> 06:56:58.000
So he's gone.

06:57:02.000 --> 06:57:03.000
Okay.

06:57:06.000 --> 06:57:08.000
You drank the ghost soup, honestly.

06:57:12.000 --> 06:57:14.000
They're a part of the darkness around us.

06:57:15.000 --> 06:57:17.000
When we say, walk with the shadows,

06:57:18.000 --> 06:57:21.000
we are asking those nightingales who have passed on to protect us,

06:57:21.000 --> 06:57:25.000
to believe that they are literally what guides our uncanny luck,

06:57:26.000 --> 06:57:28.000
by placing their hands in ours.

06:57:29.000 --> 06:57:31.000
That's why the Evermere needed to be reopened.

06:57:32.000 --> 06:57:34.000
Without it, there's no way Nocturnal was able to...

06:57:35.000 --> 06:57:37.000
I'm getting it now.

06:57:38.000 --> 06:57:39.000
How will I know if I'm needed here?

06:57:39.000 --> 06:57:41.000
If this place is in danger ever again,

06:57:42.000 --> 06:57:43.000
the shadows will call.

06:57:43.000 --> 06:57:44.000
Okay.

06:57:44.000 --> 06:57:45.000
Where should the need arise?

06:57:45.000 --> 06:57:48.000
A portal connects the Sepulchre and Nightingale Hall.

06:57:48.000 --> 06:57:50.000
Use it whenever you wish.

06:57:51.000 --> 06:57:52.000
Okay.

06:57:54.000 --> 06:57:55.000
Where will you be?

06:57:55.000 --> 06:57:58.000
I've decided to make my home at Nightingale Hall.

06:57:59.000 --> 06:58:00.000
Since it's your home as well.

06:58:01.000 --> 06:58:03.000
I hope to see you and bring you out there.

06:58:04.000 --> 06:58:07.000
Of course, I may visit some of Skyrim's cities too.

06:58:07.000 --> 06:58:09.000
Quiet things from time to time.

06:58:09.000 --> 06:58:11.000
Can't afford to get rusty now, can we?

06:58:12.000 --> 06:58:14.000
Well, I'm...

06:58:14.000 --> 06:58:15.000
I'm satisfied.

06:58:16.000 --> 06:58:17.000
Yeah, yeah, bye-bye.

06:58:17.000 --> 06:58:18.000
Okay, thank you.

06:58:19.000 --> 06:58:20.000
Thank you, hubby-bee.

06:58:20.000 --> 06:58:22.000
Is this your home now?

06:58:23.000 --> 06:58:24.000
It is!

06:58:24.000 --> 06:58:26.000
Okay, so she just hangs out here now.

06:58:26.000 --> 06:58:27.000
Girl, that's a bit depressive.

06:58:27.000 --> 06:58:29.000
But anyway, that's all for now.

06:58:29.000 --> 06:58:31.000
As long as you're having a good time and all that.

06:58:31.000 --> 06:58:35.000
Thanks for the experience of being in Nightingale.

06:58:36.000 --> 06:58:38.000
Alright, have a good night and good luck.

06:58:38.000 --> 06:58:39.000
Thank you!

06:58:39.000 --> 06:58:42.000
For those of you who need to go rest, please do rest.

06:58:42.000 --> 06:58:44.000
I am literally farting about...

06:58:46.000 --> 06:58:47.000
Cause...

06:58:48.000 --> 06:58:51.000
Mercy is going live in two hours.

06:58:51.000 --> 06:58:54.000
I'm gonna redirect into her and then it means I can...

06:58:55.000 --> 06:58:56.000
Do a little bit of...

06:58:56.000 --> 06:59:00.000
A little bit of preparation for my monetization stream tomorrow.

06:59:00.000 --> 06:59:02.000
I'll need to actually make the thumbnail.

06:59:02.000 --> 06:59:04.000
And you get a picture of my frickin' feet for the thumbnail.

06:59:04.000 --> 06:59:05.000
Omega at low.

06:59:05.000 --> 06:59:06.000
And...

06:59:07.000 --> 06:59:09.000
Oh no, what did I do now?

06:59:11.000 --> 06:59:12.000
Well, we do...

06:59:12.000 --> 06:59:13.000
Night...

06:59:13.000 --> 06:59:16.000
Night mother, night mother, send your child unto me for...

06:59:16.000 --> 06:59:17.000
Oh no, sweet mother.

06:59:17.000 --> 06:59:18.000
I keep saying night mother.

06:59:19.000 --> 06:59:20.000
Apparently...

06:59:21.000 --> 06:59:22.000
It's sweet mother.

06:59:23.000 --> 06:59:26.000
I could've sworn I turned that on.

06:59:26.000 --> 06:59:27.000
Man, there we go.

06:59:27.000 --> 06:59:28.000
Yeah.

06:59:29.000 --> 06:59:32.000
Group brushing, T minus 90 minutes.

06:59:32.000 --> 06:59:33.000
Yes.

06:59:33.000 --> 06:59:34.000
Right.

06:59:34.000 --> 06:59:36.000
I am going to make a cup of tea.

06:59:36.000 --> 06:59:38.000
If we would all like to get something to hydrate.

06:59:38.000 --> 06:59:40.000
Gotta go to Winterhold for that one.

06:59:40.000 --> 06:59:41.000
Yes.

06:59:41.000 --> 06:59:43.000
I'm gonna make a cup of tea.

06:59:44.000 --> 06:59:45.000
And then...

06:59:46.000 --> 06:59:47.000
We will...

06:59:47.000 --> 06:59:50.000
See how far we can get on the dark, brotherhood.

06:59:50.000 --> 06:59:54.000
There's absolutely no way in heck we are getting anywhere close to it.

06:59:57.000 --> 06:59:58.000
But...

06:59:58.000 --> 07:00:00.000
It doesn't mean we can't start it, okay?

07:00:00.000 --> 07:00:03.000
Man, I'll arrive late for tomorrow's stream cause I'll be at work.

07:00:04.000 --> 07:00:06.000
It's a very short stream tomorrow.

07:00:06.000 --> 07:00:09.000
It's not Skyrim part two, just...

07:00:10.000 --> 07:00:14.000
For those of you who may be lurking, there is not a Skyrim part two tomorrow

07:00:14.000 --> 07:00:16.000
cause I've completely messed up the achievements

07:00:16.000 --> 07:00:19.000
and the whole point was to do the achievements.

07:00:20.000 --> 07:00:25.000
And for some reason they're not working even though I am on Xbox Game Pass.

07:00:25.000 --> 07:00:27.000
But we do have plenty of time in the future.

07:00:27.000 --> 07:00:31.000
I will definitely come back to Skyrim once I've fixed whatever's going on.

07:00:31.000 --> 07:00:35.000
Cause honestly, I'm like, should've just played cameo.

07:00:40.000 --> 07:00:43.000
Sorry, we need to break in here so we can go talk to this kid.

07:00:44.000 --> 07:00:48.000
Sweet mother, sweet mother, send your child unto me for this soon.

07:00:50.000 --> 07:00:51.000
Very tired.

07:00:51.000 --> 07:00:52.000
Oh no.

07:00:54.000 --> 07:00:57.000
Sweet mother, send your child unto me.

07:01:01.000 --> 07:01:03.000
So you come in.

07:01:08.000 --> 07:01:09.000
Munkah.

07:01:09.000 --> 07:01:10.000
S.

07:01:13.000 --> 07:01:14.000
Are you alright?

07:01:22.000 --> 07:01:23.000
The body?

07:01:23.000 --> 07:01:24.000
She came.

07:01:24.000 --> 07:01:26.000
An assassin from a dark brotherhood.

07:01:29.000 --> 07:01:31.000
Ah yes, the black sacrum.

07:01:31.000 --> 07:01:33.000
A Wang of course.

07:01:33.000 --> 07:01:34.000
So long.

07:01:34.000 --> 07:01:36.000
So very long.

07:01:36.000 --> 07:01:38.000
But now that you're here, you can accept my contract.

07:01:39.000 --> 07:01:40.000
Your contract?

07:01:41.000 --> 07:01:43.000
My mother, she...

07:01:43.000 --> 07:01:44.000
She died.

07:01:44.000 --> 07:01:46.000
I'm all alone now.

07:01:47.000 --> 07:01:51.000
So they sent me to the terrible orphanage in Riften on her hall.

07:01:51.000 --> 07:01:54.000
The headmistress is an evil cruel woman.

07:01:54.000 --> 07:01:56.000
They call her Grelad the kind.

07:01:56.000 --> 07:01:57.000
But she's not kind.

07:01:57.000 --> 07:01:59.000
She's terrible to all of us.

07:02:00.000 --> 07:02:03.000
So I ran away and came home.

07:02:03.000 --> 07:02:05.000
And performed the black sacrament.

07:02:05.000 --> 07:02:06.000
Now we're here.

07:02:06.000 --> 07:02:08.000
And you can kill Grelad the kind.

07:02:11.000 --> 07:02:13.000
Sure, buddy.

07:02:16.000 --> 07:02:18.000
A kiss by the sweet mother.

07:02:18.000 --> 07:02:19.000
What does the book say?

07:02:19.000 --> 07:02:20.000
Hand that book over.

07:02:21.000 --> 07:02:23.000
So you wish to summon the dark brotherhood.

07:02:23.000 --> 07:02:25.000
You wish to see someone dead.

07:02:25.000 --> 07:02:29.000
Pray, child, pray, and let the night mother hear your plea.

07:02:29.000 --> 07:02:34.000
You must perform that most profane of rituals, the black sacrament.

07:02:34.000 --> 07:02:40.000
Create an effigy of the intended victim assembled from actual body parts,

07:02:40.000 --> 07:02:43.000
including a heart, skull, bones, and flesh.

07:02:43.000 --> 07:02:45.000
And circle that effigy with candles.

07:02:45.000 --> 07:02:48.000
The ritual itself must then commence.

07:02:49.000 --> 07:02:52.000
Proceed to stab the effigy repeatedly with a dagger,

07:02:52.000 --> 07:02:57.000
rubbed with the petals of a nightshade plant while whispering this plea.

07:02:57.000 --> 07:03:00.000
Sweet mother, sweet mother, send your child unto me

07:03:00.000 --> 07:03:03.000
for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear.

07:03:03.000 --> 07:03:09.000
Then wait, child, for the dread father sitheth rewards the patient.

07:03:09.000 --> 07:03:14.000
You will be visited by a representative of the dark brotherhood.

07:03:14.000 --> 07:03:17.000
So begins a contract bound in blood.

07:03:17.000 --> 07:03:19.000
That's actually really cool.

07:03:19.000 --> 07:03:21.000
Oh, I'm quite happy with that.

07:03:21.000 --> 07:03:24.000
I quite like that kind of back behind the scenes,

07:03:24.000 --> 07:03:26.000
not behind the scenes because it's like hidden in a book,

07:03:26.000 --> 07:03:28.000
so it's not behind the scenes.

07:03:28.000 --> 07:03:33.000
But I like seeing how the game like tried to explain it.

07:03:33.000 --> 07:03:34.000
It's quite thingy.

07:03:34.000 --> 07:03:36.000
Where did he find the body part?

07:03:36.000 --> 07:03:38.000
Oh, he tried his best, okay.

07:03:38.000 --> 07:03:41.000
Probably went into the crypt or something like that.

07:03:41.000 --> 07:03:44.000
So this is probably the only instance

07:03:44.000 --> 07:03:48.000
when you can perish someone in front of a whole group of people.

07:03:50.000 --> 07:03:51.000
Sorry, Hen.

07:03:55.000 --> 07:03:58.000
Yeah, you do not get in trouble for doing that.

07:03:58.000 --> 07:03:59.000
And all the kids...

07:04:02.000 --> 07:04:05.000
And they're all like laughing at our own stuff.

07:04:06.000 --> 07:04:07.000
Wait, oh, I've gone the wrong way.

07:04:07.000 --> 07:04:09.000
Sorry, I've gone the wrong way.

07:04:11.000 --> 07:04:12.000
We're saved.

07:04:14.000 --> 07:04:17.000
Yeah, literally one of the only instances

07:04:17.000 --> 07:04:19.000
you can walk in and perish someone

07:04:19.000 --> 07:04:21.000
and then come straight back out again.

07:04:21.000 --> 07:04:23.000
They don't care.

07:04:23.000 --> 07:04:24.000
No one cares.

07:04:24.000 --> 07:04:25.000
The Rift and Guards don't even care.

07:04:25.000 --> 07:04:27.000
They must have known as well.

07:04:27.000 --> 07:04:29.000
Now, the actual nice lady takes over.

07:04:29.000 --> 07:04:30.000
Yay!

07:04:31.000 --> 07:04:34.000
So really, we just did everyone a big ol' favour.

07:04:37.000 --> 07:04:39.000
I was like finding different fun ways.

07:04:39.000 --> 07:04:42.000
Apparently you can cast Friendsly in the Children Parish Gray look.

07:04:42.000 --> 07:04:44.000
I'm not sure if that's true or not.

07:04:46.000 --> 07:04:47.000
Is she...

07:04:47.000 --> 07:04:48.000
You know?

07:04:48.000 --> 07:04:50.000
Like, kinda sounds like Midoriya.

07:05:03.000 --> 07:05:05.000
What did you give me?

07:05:05.000 --> 07:05:06.000
You're a child.

07:05:06.000 --> 07:05:08.000
Completed Innocence Loss.

07:05:09.000 --> 07:05:11.000
Family heirloom?

07:05:11.000 --> 07:05:13.000
Oh, sorry, sorry.

07:05:13.000 --> 07:05:14.000
My bad.

07:05:14.000 --> 07:05:15.000
I got a little...

07:05:15.000 --> 07:05:18.000
I just needed to check what your family heirloom was.

07:05:20.000 --> 07:05:21.000
Is there any?

07:05:21.000 --> 07:05:22.000
Oh, there is.

07:05:23.000 --> 07:05:24.000
A plate?

07:05:24.000 --> 07:05:25.000
A plate.

07:05:25.000 --> 07:05:28.000
I mean, you are a child, so I guess that makes sense.

07:05:29.000 --> 07:05:31.000
Now, if I remember correctly,

07:05:31.000 --> 07:05:33.000
we need to go sleep in a bed.

07:05:34.000 --> 07:05:37.000
The first sleep the poor dragonborn has had

07:05:37.000 --> 07:05:39.000
since I started my adventures,

07:05:39.000 --> 07:05:41.000
so we'll just rent a little bed in here.

07:05:43.000 --> 07:05:46.000
You ever just accidentally dash across the house, honestly?

07:05:48.000 --> 07:05:49.000
Oh, you.

07:05:49.000 --> 07:05:50.000
Hello!

07:05:50.000 --> 07:05:51.000
Hello!

07:05:51.000 --> 07:05:53.000
Can you come a bit closer?

07:05:53.000 --> 07:05:54.000
Okay, I guess not.

07:05:55.000 --> 07:05:56.000
Yeah, I'd like to rent a room.

07:05:58.000 --> 07:05:59.000
Thanks, darling.

07:06:00.000 --> 07:06:01.000
Oh, okay.

07:06:01.000 --> 07:06:02.000
Oh, 10...

07:06:02.000 --> 07:06:03.000
10 stars!

07:06:03.000 --> 07:06:04.000
Whoa!

07:06:06.000 --> 07:06:07.000
Hello?

07:06:07.000 --> 07:06:08.000
My lady?

07:06:08.000 --> 07:06:09.000
You want to join me?

07:06:16.000 --> 07:06:17.000
Okay.

07:06:19.000 --> 07:06:21.000
Right, please stop talking to me.

07:06:21.000 --> 07:06:22.000
I'm trying to be sure in my room,

07:06:22.000 --> 07:06:23.000
but I'm having to help the NPC.

07:06:23.000 --> 07:06:24.000
Okay, there we go.

07:06:24.000 --> 07:06:26.000
Thank you for showing me my room.

07:06:27.000 --> 07:06:28.000
If you want the tip,

07:06:28.000 --> 07:06:29.000
just stay in the room, right?

07:06:29.000 --> 07:06:30.000
Get in that bed.

07:06:30.000 --> 07:06:31.000
Don't be ill.

07:06:31.000 --> 07:06:32.000
It's all right.

07:06:33.000 --> 07:06:34.000
Absolutely shocking behavior.

07:06:34.000 --> 07:06:35.000
Please stop.

07:06:35.000 --> 07:06:36.000
12 hours.

07:06:36.000 --> 07:06:38.000
We won't make a cup of tea very shortly.

07:06:38.000 --> 07:06:39.000
I'm sorry.

07:06:39.000 --> 07:06:40.000
I'm sorry.

07:06:40.000 --> 07:06:41.000
I'm getting delirious.

07:06:41.000 --> 07:06:42.000
Miss Johnny,

07:06:42.000 --> 07:06:44.000
can I be excused from the history of the Nordic class

07:06:44.000 --> 07:06:45.000
to use the bathroom?

07:06:45.000 --> 07:06:47.000
Yes, you're allowed to use the toilet.

07:06:47.000 --> 07:06:51.000
Right, I am going to go make a cup of tea.

07:06:55.000 --> 07:06:56.000
What?

07:06:56.000 --> 07:06:58.000
Was that not supposed to be kidnapped?

07:06:58.000 --> 07:07:00.000
After you perish?

07:07:02.000 --> 07:07:04.000
Does it have to be about the island?

07:07:08.000 --> 07:07:09.000
Huh.

07:07:12.000 --> 07:07:14.000
Give her to her, kid.

07:07:14.000 --> 07:07:16.000
It's after you receive a courier's lair.

07:07:16.000 --> 07:07:17.000
Ah!

07:07:17.000 --> 07:07:18.000
How are you streaming now?

07:07:18.000 --> 07:07:20.000
How are you so powerful?

07:07:20.000 --> 07:07:21.000
I'm not sure.

07:07:21.000 --> 07:07:22.000
I don't know.

07:07:22.000 --> 07:07:23.000
I don't know.

07:07:23.000 --> 07:07:24.000
I don't know.

07:07:24.000 --> 07:07:25.000
I don't know.

07:07:25.000 --> 07:07:26.000
I don't know.

07:07:26.000 --> 07:07:27.000
What are you streaming now?

07:07:27.000 --> 07:07:28.000
How are you so powerful?

07:07:28.000 --> 07:07:31.000
That is called autism.

07:07:31.000 --> 07:07:33.000
And I love my games.

07:07:33.000 --> 07:07:35.000
Right, I'm waiting on the courier.

07:07:35.000 --> 07:07:37.000
Courier, courier.

07:07:37.000 --> 07:07:39.000
Courier, courier.

07:07:39.000 --> 07:07:40.000
Give me a letter.

07:07:40.000 --> 07:07:42.000
Courier, my boss.

07:07:42.000 --> 07:07:43.000
Right, ah, sorry.

07:07:43.000 --> 07:07:45.000
I'm going to go get a cup of tea to recalibrate

07:07:45.000 --> 07:07:48.000
because I have been playing for a hot second.

07:07:48.000 --> 07:07:50.000
I'm going to have to pause the game sadly

07:07:50.000 --> 07:07:52.000
because there can be NPC events

07:07:52.000 --> 07:07:54.000
such as cultists entering the town

07:07:54.000 --> 07:07:56.000
which can kill NPCs.

07:07:56.000 --> 07:07:57.000
So I will have it paused

07:07:57.000 --> 07:07:59.000
whilst I go quickly make a cup of tea.

07:07:59.000 --> 07:08:04.000
Please do stretch your legs

07:08:04.000 --> 07:08:06.000
and get yourself a wee water

07:08:06.000 --> 07:08:09.000
and have a pee.

07:08:09.000 --> 07:08:11.000
You've got to sleep.

07:08:11.000 --> 07:08:12.000
No.

07:08:12.000 --> 07:08:14.000
All right, sorry, man.

07:08:14.000 --> 07:08:16.000
Yeah, I thought you had to sleep right away

07:08:16.000 --> 07:08:18.000
but I need to receive the letter

07:08:18.000 --> 07:08:19.000
with a hand that says we know

07:08:19.000 --> 07:08:22.000
and then go to sleep, okay?

07:08:22.000 --> 07:08:24.000
So go for a tinkle.

07:08:24.000 --> 07:08:25.000
Go get some water.

07:08:25.000 --> 07:08:27.000
I'm going to get a cup of tea

07:08:27.000 --> 07:08:28.000
and we're going to recalibrate

07:08:28.000 --> 07:08:30.000
and come back and meet in the middle.

07:08:30.000 --> 07:08:32.000
It will be a couple of minutes, okay?

07:08:32.000 --> 07:08:35.000
I think I can get a wee snack.

07:08:35.000 --> 07:08:38.000
Right, I'll be right back.

07:09:22.000 --> 07:09:24.000
Good night.

07:09:52.000 --> 07:09:55.000
Good night.

07:10:22.000 --> 07:10:25.000
Good night.

07:10:52.000 --> 07:10:55.000
Good night.

07:11:22.000 --> 07:11:24.000
Good night.

07:11:52.000 --> 07:11:55.000
Good night.

07:12:22.000 --> 07:12:24.000
Good night.

07:12:52.000 --> 07:12:54.000
Good night.

07:13:22.000 --> 07:13:25.000
Good night.

07:13:52.000 --> 07:13:54.000
Good night.

07:14:22.000 --> 07:14:24.000
Good night.

07:14:52.000 --> 07:15:05.000
Welcome to Europe.

07:15:05.000 --> 07:15:07.000
Oh, wait, I said that wrong.

07:15:07.000 --> 07:15:10.000
Welcome to Europe, young man.

07:15:10.000 --> 07:15:15.000
Remember that 10-year-old vision?

07:15:15.000 --> 07:15:18.000
Remember that 10-year-old vision?

07:15:18.000 --> 07:15:20.000
Oh.

07:15:20.000 --> 07:15:23.000
Sorry, that was the worst Dutch I think I've ever done so far.

07:15:23.000 --> 07:15:25.000
I do apologize to any...

07:15:25.000 --> 07:15:28.000
...Nederland-Mensen who are listening in.

07:15:28.000 --> 07:15:30.000
But everyone else is just like,

07:15:30.000 --> 07:15:32.000
what on earth are you even on about?

07:15:32.000 --> 07:15:34.000
Hi.

07:15:34.000 --> 07:15:36.000
Welcome back.

07:15:36.000 --> 07:15:38.000
What, you thought I was gone forever?

07:15:38.000 --> 07:15:40.000
I've got me a cup of tea,

07:15:40.000 --> 07:15:42.000
and I've actually got strupewafel.

07:15:42.000 --> 07:15:43.000
I'm not even kidding.

07:15:43.000 --> 07:15:45.000
I have actual strupewafel.

07:15:45.000 --> 07:15:48.000
I was supposed to eat it on the rating stream,

07:15:48.000 --> 07:15:53.000
but I couldn't find any more European snacks.

07:15:53.000 --> 07:15:58.000
So I'm just literally going to eat a little strupewafel.

07:15:58.000 --> 07:16:01.000
Welcome back.

07:16:01.000 --> 07:16:02.000
I love...

07:16:02.000 --> 07:16:04.000
Strupewafel is like crack cocaine.

07:16:04.000 --> 07:16:06.000
Sorry, but it's not.

07:16:06.000 --> 07:16:08.000
Strupewafel is like crack cocaine.

07:16:08.000 --> 07:16:10.000
Sorry, but it's so good.

07:16:10.000 --> 07:16:12.000
Um...

07:16:12.000 --> 07:16:16.000
Yes, mercy for the snippets who are lurking.

07:16:16.000 --> 07:16:19.000
I appreciate you, even if I'm not your flavor.

07:16:19.000 --> 07:16:20.000
Um...

07:16:20.000 --> 07:16:26.000
Tea minus one hour and 40 minutes until your...

07:16:26.000 --> 07:16:31.000
Kohai is ready to say hi-hi.

07:16:31.000 --> 07:16:33.000
And prove that she can't whistle.

07:16:33.000 --> 07:16:35.000
Which is adorable.

07:16:35.000 --> 07:16:38.000
I can't believe I hired her on the basis she can't whistle.

07:16:38.000 --> 07:16:39.000
Stop leaving a...

07:16:39.000 --> 07:16:42.000
What? I'm not allowed to go get a cup of tea?

07:16:42.000 --> 07:16:44.000
For my boys?

07:16:44.000 --> 07:16:45.000
What do you mean?

07:16:45.000 --> 07:16:47.000
You like hearing my words?

07:16:47.000 --> 07:16:48.000
Like all cranky?

07:16:48.000 --> 07:16:49.000
Yeah.

07:16:49.000 --> 07:16:51.000
Are you ending when mercy comes on?

07:16:51.000 --> 07:16:54.000
Yes, I'm going to redirect into her on purpose

07:16:54.000 --> 07:16:59.000
because I didn't know I was getting monetization today.

07:16:59.000 --> 07:17:02.000
So tomorrow we're doing the monetization celebration.

07:17:02.000 --> 07:17:05.000
So I need to set up like all the emotes

07:17:05.000 --> 07:17:08.000
and I need to set up on the price.

07:17:08.000 --> 07:17:12.000
And I think very sadly I have to freaking charge more than 4.99

07:17:12.000 --> 07:17:19.000
and I really don't want to charge more than 4.99 US dollars.

07:17:19.000 --> 07:17:24.000
But I think I might have to because of this YouTube gifting stuff.

07:17:24.000 --> 07:17:29.000
Can any of yous confirm that YouTube gifting thing is a nightmare or a hassle?

07:17:29.000 --> 07:17:31.000
I'm going to take a bite of my waffle.

07:17:41.000 --> 07:17:44.000
I know it's only like 2 cents difference.

07:17:44.000 --> 07:17:46.000
I just don't like that.

07:17:46.000 --> 07:17:47.000
Hold on.

07:17:47.000 --> 07:17:53.000
I'm going to check out marshmallows.

07:17:53.000 --> 07:17:55.000
If you'd like to send me any marshmallows,

07:17:55.000 --> 07:18:00.000
I'm just going to take a quick pause champ on top of everything.

07:18:00.000 --> 07:18:01.000
Jesus Christ.

07:18:01.000 --> 07:18:03.000
Why do I have so many DMs?

07:18:06.000 --> 07:18:07.000
Okay.

07:18:07.000 --> 07:18:08.000
I don't know.

07:18:09.000 --> 07:18:10.000
Oh good.

07:18:10.000 --> 07:18:11.000
For the most part.

07:18:12.000 --> 07:18:14.000
Oh, and now I can't see my mouse again.

07:18:16.000 --> 07:18:17.000
Okay, marshmallow refresh.

07:18:17.000 --> 07:18:18.000
Let's go.

07:18:19.000 --> 07:18:28.000
A lot of follow girls have 1.99 tier and then 4.99 and the gift goes to the 4.99.

07:18:32.000 --> 07:18:34.000
Would exactly 5 dollars work?

07:18:34.000 --> 07:18:35.000
I possibly.

07:18:46.000 --> 07:18:47.000
Hello mummy.

07:18:47.000 --> 07:18:50.000
You're asking what software baby uses for 3D.

07:18:50.000 --> 07:18:54.000
It's called Warudo for full body tracking.

07:18:54.000 --> 07:18:56.000
There's a lot of videos about it.

07:18:56.000 --> 07:18:59.000
But I think most YouTubers use Sony MoCopy,

07:18:59.000 --> 07:19:03.000
SlimeVR or Vine trackers.

07:19:03.000 --> 07:19:04.000
Okay, okay.

07:19:07.000 --> 07:19:08.000
It's okay mummy.

07:19:08.000 --> 07:19:10.000
I know you can't open my last Mario link on stream.

07:19:10.000 --> 07:19:13.000
Don't forget to check later.

07:19:13.000 --> 07:19:15.000
Is it bad that I check?

07:19:15.000 --> 07:19:17.000
Like as soon as I go offline,

07:19:17.000 --> 07:19:20.000
I just spend like another 30 minutes and I'm like, yeah.

07:19:26.000 --> 07:19:27.000
What's the problem with gifting?

07:19:27.000 --> 07:19:32.000
So the issue is if someone is very kind to gift,

07:19:32.000 --> 07:19:35.000
but they can't dictate what type of tier to give,

07:19:35.000 --> 07:19:40.000
it means outsiders isn't a nice term to use.

07:19:40.000 --> 07:19:41.000
That's not the correct term.

07:19:41.000 --> 07:19:45.000
But someone who maybe...

07:19:47.000 --> 07:19:48.000
What's the word?

07:19:48.000 --> 07:19:50.000
I'm trying to think.

07:19:51.000 --> 07:19:57.000
Someone who gets access to membership streams

07:19:57.000 --> 07:19:59.000
that should name.

07:19:59.000 --> 07:20:04.000
You know, like someone who's just going to be rude about it

07:20:04.000 --> 07:20:05.000
or whatever.

07:20:06.000 --> 07:20:07.000
I don't know.

07:20:08.000 --> 07:20:11.000
Yeah, use whatever.

07:20:11.000 --> 07:20:15.000
It's better to have people watching the membership streams

07:20:15.000 --> 07:20:17.000
that are actually interested

07:20:17.000 --> 07:20:20.000
because someone might get a message

07:20:20.000 --> 07:20:23.000
and it's like, oh right, okay.

07:20:29.000 --> 07:20:32.000
You might be able to turn on gifting entirely.

07:20:32.000 --> 07:20:34.000
Well, the problem is gifting is a massive money source

07:20:34.000 --> 07:20:35.000
for the girls.

07:20:38.000 --> 07:20:43.000
If someone's going to be a shitter in members' content,

07:20:43.000 --> 07:20:45.000
they better be paying out their own pocket.

07:20:45.000 --> 07:20:47.000
Ah, that's so funny.

07:20:47.000 --> 07:20:49.000
I'm sorry, but that's actually such a funny statement.

07:20:51.000 --> 07:20:53.000
Okay, Strani and fellow reeflings.

07:20:53.000 --> 07:20:58.000
I'm going to have a fun rest of the stream.

07:20:58.000 --> 07:20:59.000
Oh, now I need to go.

07:20:59.000 --> 07:21:01.000
Sorry, fucking words are blending together.

07:21:01.000 --> 07:21:03.000
I'll see you tomorrow.

07:21:03.000 --> 07:21:06.000
Yes, I think it'll be roughly two hours.

07:21:07.000 --> 07:21:09.000
It's a short stream tomorrow, do apologize,

07:21:09.000 --> 07:21:11.000
but I'm needing overall vocal rest.

07:21:11.000 --> 07:21:14.000
I've got quite a few VTuber ASMR collabs coming up,

07:21:14.000 --> 07:21:18.000
so I'm needing to be a good girl and rest and try my best.

07:21:21.000 --> 07:21:24.000
I am a Spanish reefling and I've been very...

07:21:25.000 --> 07:21:26.000
No, you've not.

07:21:28.000 --> 07:21:29.000
Hold on.

07:21:30.000 --> 07:21:32.000
You've helped me pass some hard times,

07:21:32.000 --> 07:21:35.000
so I just want to know that if you're really proud of you

07:21:35.000 --> 07:21:37.000
your streams go...

07:21:37.000 --> 07:21:42.000
Also, I like how you act on stream about gapping

07:21:42.000 --> 07:21:44.000
and ranking burps is fun.

07:21:44.000 --> 07:21:46.000
Se te quiera.

07:21:46.000 --> 07:21:53.000
What is se te quiera in español in English for me,

07:21:53.000 --> 07:21:56.000
because I don't know what se te quiera means.

07:21:57.000 --> 07:21:58.000
I think it means.

07:22:00.000 --> 07:22:01.000
I don't even know.

07:22:05.000 --> 07:22:07.000
You are truly an anomaly.

07:22:07.000 --> 07:22:11.000
I've never seen someone who is so intensely thoughtful

07:22:11.000 --> 07:22:15.000
in caring about both your daughters and reefillings.

07:22:15.000 --> 07:22:17.000
Yeah, also shameless.

07:22:17.000 --> 07:22:18.000
Hold on.

07:22:18.000 --> 07:22:19.000
What am I getting?

07:22:19.000 --> 07:22:21.000
What am I getting spanked by?

07:22:22.000 --> 07:22:24.000
It's a level of authenticity.

07:22:24.000 --> 07:22:26.000
I would never...

07:22:26.000 --> 07:22:29.000
I would never even see in a person,

07:22:29.000 --> 07:22:30.000
let alone a VTuber.

07:22:30.000 --> 07:22:32.000
I wish you all the success in the world.

07:22:32.000 --> 07:22:33.000
Wow.

07:22:33.000 --> 07:22:35.000
You did an absolutely fantastic job

07:22:35.000 --> 07:22:37.000
on the tryharding in the ASMR stream.

07:22:37.000 --> 07:22:39.000
I can only assume you have a really good coach

07:22:39.000 --> 07:22:42.000
since it took me over a year to study to get to that level.

07:22:43.000 --> 07:22:44.000
A coach?

07:22:44.000 --> 07:22:46.000
Like a hypno coach?

07:22:46.000 --> 07:22:47.000
No.

07:22:47.000 --> 07:22:49.000
That's just called autism.

07:22:49.000 --> 07:22:51.000
In general interest.

07:22:51.000 --> 07:22:54.000
I just apply what I like to whatever

07:22:54.000 --> 07:22:56.000
and I do it my way.

07:22:56.000 --> 07:22:58.000
Also, it's something I would never do otherwise,

07:22:58.000 --> 07:22:59.000
but my...

07:23:00.000 --> 07:23:03.000
But my girlfriend has convinced me

07:23:03.000 --> 07:23:04.000
I should do...

07:23:04.000 --> 07:23:05.000
Bibbius?

07:23:05.000 --> 07:23:07.000
So I've printed out 21 pages

07:23:07.000 --> 07:23:10.000
so I can build some additional cognitive habits.

07:23:10.000 --> 07:23:12.000
I made a collage by the end of the month.

07:23:13.000 --> 07:23:14.000
What?

07:23:14.000 --> 07:23:16.000
What is this?

07:23:23.000 --> 07:23:24.000
What?

07:23:24.000 --> 07:23:25.000
Well...

07:23:26.000 --> 07:23:27.000
What is this?

07:23:28.000 --> 07:23:31.000
What are these additional cognitive habits?

07:23:32.000 --> 07:23:33.000
What is this?

07:23:36.000 --> 07:23:37.000
21 Bibbius?

07:23:37.000 --> 07:23:38.000
For me?

07:23:38.000 --> 07:23:39.000
For me?

07:23:39.000 --> 07:23:40.000
You have that in you?

07:23:40.000 --> 07:23:41.000
Right now?

07:23:43.000 --> 07:23:44.000
It's almost 5 am.

07:23:44.000 --> 07:23:45.000
Yes, please rest well.

07:23:45.000 --> 07:23:48.000
For those of you who are hanging on by a thread,

07:23:48.000 --> 07:23:52.000
we're just going to start off the Dark Brotherhood

07:23:52.000 --> 07:23:53.000
at this point.

07:23:53.000 --> 07:23:55.000
I'm going to see if I can fix achievements

07:23:55.000 --> 07:23:57.000
and possibly we can come back to Skyrim,

07:23:57.000 --> 07:23:59.000
but tomorrow is being steamrolled

07:23:59.000 --> 07:24:01.000
by monetization celebration stream.

07:24:03.000 --> 07:24:06.000
Gotta get those micro plastics out of you somehow, honestly.

07:24:11.000 --> 07:24:14.000
Hey Lassie, would you kindly raise the model up

07:24:14.000 --> 07:24:16.000
so you can see more of the girlies?

07:24:16.000 --> 07:24:17.000
You could zoom out a bit too

07:24:17.000 --> 07:24:19.000
if you don't want to block too much of the game.

07:24:20.000 --> 07:24:22.000
Someone said they don't like it.

07:24:23.000 --> 07:24:24.000
Where is it?

07:24:25.000 --> 07:24:27.000
I would have to go like this.

07:24:31.000 --> 07:24:32.000
Does this work?

07:24:32.000 --> 07:24:33.000
Hold on.

07:24:34.000 --> 07:24:35.000
Does that work?

07:24:36.000 --> 07:24:37.000
It does work.

07:24:41.000 --> 07:24:42.000
That's terrible.

07:24:45.000 --> 07:24:47.000
I can't really get away with it too much.

07:24:48.000 --> 07:24:49.000
Let's behave.

07:24:49.000 --> 07:24:54.000
A tomato a day keeps the other boys okay.

07:24:54.000 --> 07:24:57.000
Yes, that is our new slogan, ladies and gentlemen.

07:24:58.000 --> 07:25:01.000
Tomato a day keeps the other boy else okay.

07:25:02.000 --> 07:25:04.000
I'm still trying to eat the same strip waffle.

07:25:04.000 --> 07:25:05.000
I'm getting so distracted.

07:25:06.000 --> 07:25:08.000
So when's the audio of you rambling about assassin's greed

07:25:08.000 --> 07:25:10.000
or something while getting your...

07:25:13.000 --> 07:25:15.000
Oh my god, you guys are getting our while.

07:25:16.000 --> 07:25:18.000
I'm actually doing a review.

07:25:19.000 --> 07:25:24.000
On Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

07:25:24.000 --> 07:25:26.000
which should come out around November.

07:25:26.000 --> 07:25:28.000
Like I'm doing an actual game review footage.

07:25:28.000 --> 07:25:30.000
Like I'm being so serious on it.

07:25:30.000 --> 07:25:33.000
So if you like hearing my accent putting you to sleep

07:25:33.000 --> 07:25:35.000
well I can tell you about Assassin's Creed

07:25:35.000 --> 07:25:36.000
and how amazing it is.

07:25:39.000 --> 07:25:41.000
Sometimes I wish we could see the film.

07:25:41.000 --> 07:25:43.000
They're pretty outrageous.

07:25:43.000 --> 07:25:46.000
I'm trying my best to like dart around them.

07:25:46.000 --> 07:25:48.000
But good night rest well those who need to rest.

07:25:49.000 --> 07:25:51.000
I love Strauner's The Cuttlefish in this hoose.

07:25:55.000 --> 07:25:59.000
Strauny, if you like V&N games, kind of reckon Valhalla is such a good game

07:25:59.000 --> 07:26:00.000
and I think you'll like it.

07:26:00.000 --> 07:26:02.000
I most certainly will check that out.

07:26:02.000 --> 07:26:04.000
I may have in another life thought I was about to play it

07:26:04.000 --> 07:26:06.000
and then play the complete wrong game

07:26:06.000 --> 07:26:08.000
which was called Helltaker I believe.

07:26:08.000 --> 07:26:09.000
And it was also a puzzle game

07:26:09.000 --> 07:26:12.000
and I was so confused on why the game looked so different

07:26:12.000 --> 07:26:14.000
to what I was playing

07:26:14.000 --> 07:26:16.000
and it turns out I was playing the completely wrong game.

07:26:16.000 --> 07:26:19.000
But yes, I would love to give Valhalla a try.

07:26:21.000 --> 07:26:24.000
Hi cuttles, are Mondays and Tuesdays always going to be endurance?

07:26:27.000 --> 07:26:29.000
No, they are not.

07:26:29.000 --> 07:26:33.000
It's just a Quinky Dink really that I put on Monday and Tuesday.

07:26:33.000 --> 07:26:36.000
But no, they're not always going to be the endurance on those days.

07:26:38.000 --> 07:26:39.000
Yes.

07:26:46.000 --> 07:26:47.000
Having you laugh about to...

07:26:47.000 --> 07:26:48.000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

07:26:48.000 --> 07:26:49.000
By the Pope!

07:27:02.000 --> 07:27:03.000
I'm going to be so honest.

07:27:03.000 --> 07:27:06.000
Brian did not help with my confusion

07:27:06.000 --> 07:27:09.000
on the pronunciation of your name, tiny spainy.

07:27:10.000 --> 07:27:11.000
What?

07:27:11.000 --> 07:27:13.000
And you had it right.

07:27:13.000 --> 07:27:17.000
As spainy is pronounced like a spainy anteater.

07:27:17.000 --> 07:27:23.000
A spainy anteater or a spiny anteater.

07:27:24.000 --> 07:27:26.000
Brian just made that ten times worse

07:27:26.000 --> 07:27:29.000
and I do apologize if I'm now officially butchering it

07:27:29.000 --> 07:27:30.000
but thank you for the tip.

07:27:31.000 --> 07:27:33.000
Do it phonetically in chat.

07:27:34.000 --> 07:27:37.000
Right, so it's either spainy

07:27:37.000 --> 07:27:41.000
or did I even spainy?

07:27:41.000 --> 07:27:42.000
So, you know.

07:27:45.000 --> 07:27:46.000
Spainy.

07:27:46.000 --> 07:27:47.000
Okay.

07:27:47.000 --> 07:27:48.000
Spainy.

07:27:49.000 --> 07:27:50.000
We got there in the end.

07:27:50.000 --> 07:27:55.000
Literally, I'm renaming everyone who just doesn't have an easy to rename for me.

07:27:58.000 --> 07:27:59.000
Spiny.

07:27:59.000 --> 07:28:04.000
There are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday endurance streams.

07:28:04.000 --> 07:28:05.000
Yes.

07:28:06.000 --> 07:28:07.000
Mostly the stream stipend.

07:28:07.000 --> 07:28:10.000
I'll try and do for like a big amount of time

07:28:10.000 --> 07:28:12.000
because I know not everyone's available

07:28:12.000 --> 07:28:15.000
at the one time zone, if you will.

07:28:22.000 --> 07:28:24.000
Having you up about developmental psychology

07:28:24.000 --> 07:28:30.000
and socially inculcated reactions to stress

07:28:30.000 --> 07:28:32.000
made me realize I really wish that physical touch and affection

07:28:32.000 --> 07:28:33.000
was more normalised in society.

07:28:33.000 --> 07:28:35.000
Especially for men, male socialised people.

07:28:35.000 --> 07:28:36.000
People need more hugs these days.

07:28:36.000 --> 07:28:38.000
Also, I'm curious how you deal with the stress

07:28:38.000 --> 07:28:41.000
and she mentioned you don't know how we do it.

07:28:44.000 --> 07:28:48.000
I always have a goal or something to work towards

07:28:48.000 --> 07:28:51.000
which helps distract me from what I'm feeling in the moment

07:28:51.000 --> 07:28:55.000
and essentially makes me numb and work through it

07:28:55.000 --> 07:28:59.000
so right now my goal is to help the girls achieve what they want.

07:29:00.000 --> 07:29:03.000
So I'm like, even though I'm stressed

07:29:03.000 --> 07:29:06.000
and I'm worried and I'm this and I'm that

07:29:06.000 --> 07:29:11.000
because they are a much more important focus on my life

07:29:11.000 --> 07:29:15.000
it's kind of one of those things where I can just put it to the side for now

07:29:15.000 --> 07:29:18.000
and right, okay, what's next?

07:29:18.000 --> 07:29:21.000
Once I get offline, I have some lovely VTubers

07:29:21.000 --> 07:29:23.000
who are waiting on an ASMR collab from me.

07:29:23.000 --> 07:29:26.000
I have to send away shorts for the girls.

07:29:26.000 --> 07:29:28.000
I need to record that for them.

07:29:29.000 --> 07:29:31.000
I need to do...

07:29:38.000 --> 07:29:40.000
Every word is hard to pronounce.

07:29:40.000 --> 07:29:44.000
If you're bad enough, for example, I pronounce spatula, spatula.

07:29:44.000 --> 07:29:50.000
Honestly, I think having a purpose is really useful in general.

07:29:50.000 --> 07:29:53.000
Yes, I agree with that, I also do it that way.

07:29:53.000 --> 07:29:57.000
It's so tough to tackle men's socialisation

07:29:57.000 --> 07:30:01.000
because where does it start?

07:30:01.000 --> 07:30:05.000
It starts in the home, but then where does it get affected?

07:30:05.000 --> 07:30:07.000
Secondary socialisation at school.

07:30:07.000 --> 07:30:11.000
I don't know if you guys had this, but in Scotland

07:30:14.000 --> 07:30:18.000
it became so quickly, oh that's gay, to show any affection

07:30:18.000 --> 07:30:23.000
in any sense, in a basic hug, a basic handshake

07:30:23.000 --> 07:30:26.000
rubbing shoulders against each other.

07:30:26.000 --> 07:30:30.000
If you're both gay, you get, you get, and it starts from there

07:30:30.000 --> 07:30:34.000
and then that isolation progresses further and further

07:30:34.000 --> 07:30:38.000
to the point where the most natural thing,

07:30:38.000 --> 07:30:42.000
which is a reassuring hug or embrace when you meet someone you know

07:30:42.000 --> 07:30:49.000
becomes this almost taboo, unfamiliar territory.

07:30:49.000 --> 07:30:53.000
And it is such a shame that you even have to experience that

07:30:53.000 --> 07:30:57.000
because of the secondary socialisation, because your primary socialisation

07:30:57.000 --> 07:31:01.000
which is your family, you know about your dad came home

07:31:01.000 --> 07:31:05.000
and you gave him a big hug, like oh dad, and when you went and visited

07:31:05.000 --> 07:31:08.000
your grandparents, oh granddad, grand, and gave him a wee kiss

07:31:08.000 --> 07:31:12.000
and a wee hug and all that, and it all goes out the window

07:31:12.000 --> 07:31:16.000
because of secondary socialisation.

07:31:16.000 --> 07:31:20.000
Yet behind closed doors, behind closed doors, behind families

07:31:20.000 --> 07:31:24.000
perfectly normal, absolutely normal behaviour

07:31:24.000 --> 07:31:30.000
and it's very frustrating because to even think of how to tackle it

07:31:30.000 --> 07:31:33.000
where do you even start?

07:31:33.000 --> 07:31:38.000
Because the way it's set up is it's your fault

07:31:38.000 --> 07:31:42.000
on an individual level that you can't do these things

07:31:42.000 --> 07:31:46.000
that you can't hug your bro that you meet up with once a month

07:31:46.000 --> 07:31:50.000
and you can, it's your fault because

07:31:50.000 --> 07:31:54.000
you didn't keep up with that societal norm, you didn't break the moat

07:31:54.000 --> 07:31:59.000
you, like see how it's so hard to break from society's grasp at that point?

07:31:59.000 --> 07:32:04.000
Someone says how's the game going? I'm so sorry, I'm currently in a rant about

07:32:04.000 --> 07:32:10.000
the social education that you get after, I'm freaking going on a rant again

07:32:10.000 --> 07:32:14.000
I can't stop, I can't stop myself, it's fascinating stuff

07:32:14.000 --> 07:32:18.000
when you start to really break it down, it becomes almost

07:32:18.000 --> 07:32:22.000
frustrating when you realise how bare bones and simplistic humans

07:32:22.000 --> 07:32:26.000
are in nature and yet we are, pardon me, sorry, I'm burping away

07:32:26.000 --> 07:32:29.000
we are our own biggest enemies

07:32:29.000 --> 07:32:34.000
we live in a society, literally, I'm typing that too

07:32:34.000 --> 07:32:39.000
we live in a society

07:32:39.000 --> 07:32:43.000
that's it, I'm typing that in chat, that's me getting it out there

07:32:43.000 --> 07:32:47.000
we live in a society, get that out, get that off your chest

07:32:47.000 --> 07:32:51.000
you're welcome to type we live in a society as well in chat to get it off your chest

07:32:51.000 --> 07:32:55.000
because we do live in a society

07:32:55.000 --> 07:32:59.000
we live in a society, therapy stream when?

07:32:59.000 --> 07:33:03.000
oh I'm not sure I can do that, Mercy's actually doing

07:33:03.000 --> 07:33:07.000
a terrible therapy advice stream

07:33:07.000 --> 07:33:11.000
we live in a society

07:33:11.000 --> 07:33:15.000
wait, yes

07:33:15.000 --> 07:33:19.000
wait, yes, that, sorry, I just read that

07:33:19.000 --> 07:33:23.000
refling that was like your toes did everything for me, you're welcome

07:33:23.000 --> 07:33:27.000
after this stream

07:33:27.000 --> 07:33:31.000
tonight, with all the conspiracy talk, I need you to do

07:33:31.000 --> 07:33:35.000
conspiracy theory talking stream with Pippa, it would be incredible, love your yapping

07:33:35.000 --> 07:33:39.000
I just can't wait to get enough of the adorable cut of it, oh I don't know if I would go too far

07:33:39.000 --> 07:33:43.000
I've not had a chance to watch Pippa's content in a very long time

07:33:43.000 --> 07:33:47.000
but I don't know if I would go too far and I'm like

07:33:47.000 --> 07:33:51.000
I, my ideas are quite

07:33:51.000 --> 07:33:55.000
alienating, like as much as we were meming on needy streamer overload

07:33:55.000 --> 07:33:59.000
my

07:33:59.000 --> 07:34:03.000
I know you're not really supposed to talk about any of that, you're supposed to be a tee hee

07:34:03.000 --> 07:34:07.000
but yeah, I'm thinking you never know

07:34:07.000 --> 07:34:11.000
I plan on writing a fairly long fantasy of mine

07:34:11.000 --> 07:34:15.000
I've had of you, it's still cringe, I want to write it though as it was extremely

07:34:15.000 --> 07:34:19.000
pent up after you did it, is pace been fine for this

07:34:19.000 --> 07:34:23.000
yes, I recommend it

07:34:23.000 --> 07:34:27.000
oh no, strong is a moon truth, oh god what's that, I don't even know what that is

07:34:27.000 --> 07:34:31.000
I don't know if I'd go too far, she says when talking about the yabba

07:34:31.000 --> 07:34:35.000
it would be a race to see who will go too far, you're a Pippa

07:34:35.000 --> 07:34:39.000
I'm like, I'm probably

07:34:39.000 --> 07:34:43.000
1984 dystopian type

07:34:43.000 --> 07:34:47.000
allegations, I don't know what

07:34:47.000 --> 07:34:51.000
Pippa's field is in particular

07:34:51.000 --> 07:34:55.000
but I am dystopian based, whatever horrors of man made comprehension you

07:34:55.000 --> 07:34:59.000
can think of, have occurred, you know, I'm like that

07:34:59.000 --> 07:35:03.000
kind of side of things, can you please say in the thickest

07:35:03.000 --> 07:35:07.000
Thailand accent

07:35:07.000 --> 07:35:11.000
I cast tongue positional

07:35:11.000 --> 07:35:15.000
awareness, sorry that was a really rough accent but there you go

07:35:15.000 --> 07:35:19.000
what's your favourite, Pringles favour

07:35:19.000 --> 07:35:23.000
paprika, I love Pappangles, Pippa is there

07:35:23.000 --> 07:35:27.000
and lizards are in government, literally 1984, Shawnee Calls

07:35:27.000 --> 07:35:31.000
Pippa is just

07:35:31.000 --> 07:35:35.000
psycho, she'll go way too far quicker

07:35:35.000 --> 07:35:39.000
well we shouldn't egg her on, how about we just leave this as

07:35:39.000 --> 07:35:43.000
moon truth or believes the moon is a hologram

07:35:43.000 --> 07:35:47.000
is a conspiracy theory made up to clown on

07:35:47.000 --> 07:35:51.000
that people actually started, well

07:35:51.000 --> 07:35:55.000
I have terrible news, I'm afraid I don't meet much of the requirements of a conspiracy

07:35:55.000 --> 07:35:59.000
theory, I'm afraid that yes, our planet is in fact

07:35:59.000 --> 07:36:03.000
very controversial, I know

07:36:03.000 --> 07:36:07.000
it's okay, it's okay, you can unsubscribe

07:36:07.000 --> 07:36:11.000
at least it's not Fahrenheit 451 yet

07:36:11.000 --> 07:36:15.000
right?

07:36:15.000 --> 07:36:19.000
yeah, Fahrenheit 451

07:36:19.000 --> 07:36:23.000
yeah

07:36:23.000 --> 07:36:27.000
I guess if the reason why

07:36:27.000 --> 07:36:31.000
a lot of media before

07:36:31.000 --> 07:36:35.000
a certain year was kind of scrubbed on a mass level, so people realise

07:36:35.000 --> 07:36:39.000
people don't know that in every 100 years

07:36:39.000 --> 07:36:43.000
I try to get a sense of that

07:36:43.000 --> 07:36:51.000
true, Iron Reaver true

07:36:51.000 --> 07:36:55.000
right, imagine burning books

07:36:55.000 --> 07:36:59.000
you're a round airther unsubbed, I can't believe it

07:36:59.000 --> 07:37:03.000
the moon round, the sun round

07:37:03.000 --> 07:37:07.000
the earth on a turtle's back and world of warcraft

07:37:07.000 --> 07:37:11.000
that's all I'm saying

07:37:11.000 --> 07:37:15.000
the earth is round, oh wait isn't it not like a, there's like a certain name

07:37:15.000 --> 07:37:19.000
because it's like a wonky round and not a perfect round

07:37:19.000 --> 07:37:23.000
something like that

07:37:23.000 --> 07:37:27.000
have I shared any bibboots?

07:37:27.000 --> 07:37:31.000
I actually don't share them with the girls

07:37:31.000 --> 07:37:35.000
just because

07:37:35.000 --> 07:37:39.000
I don't know I just, it's never really occurred to me to do such a thing

07:37:39.000 --> 07:37:43.000
an oval lumpy ball, yeah a lumpy ball

07:37:43.000 --> 07:37:47.000
remember to check your balls regularly

07:37:47.000 --> 07:37:51.000
find a lump, get it checked out ladies and gentlemen

07:37:51.000 --> 07:37:55.000
and before you go, it's embarrassing

07:37:55.000 --> 07:37:59.000
I assure you the person who is doing the ultrasound on your boss act

07:37:59.000 --> 07:38:03.000
has already looked at about 10 sacks that day already

07:38:03.000 --> 07:38:07.000
and within that week has probably seen over 100

07:38:07.000 --> 07:38:11.000
I assure you your wristicles raggy are not that unique

07:38:11.000 --> 07:38:15.000
get yourself checked out if you are worried

07:38:15.000 --> 07:38:19.000
an ultrasound, yeah that's what they do against your

07:38:19.000 --> 07:38:23.000
if you have a bump you get an ultrasound on your

07:38:23.000 --> 07:38:27.000
wristicle, raggy

07:38:27.000 --> 07:38:31.000
that's not the thing, isn't that an ultrasound? I checked I'm clear

07:38:31.000 --> 07:38:35.000
I mean we could check live if you want

07:38:35.000 --> 07:38:39.000
wow I zoomed through the backlog at 2x speed after hearing

07:38:39.000 --> 07:38:43.000
back where you read my marrow

07:38:43.000 --> 07:38:47.000
I found a lump and they have no idea what it is

07:38:47.000 --> 07:38:51.000
some things can be completely benign

07:38:51.000 --> 07:38:55.000
like you know we all come out a bit wonky

07:38:55.000 --> 07:38:59.000
can you come out 100% a perfect specimen now

07:38:59.000 --> 07:39:03.000
it's definitely thing had me balls all just sounded clear

07:39:03.000 --> 07:39:07.000
if you really want to, yeah right okay everyone follow my

07:39:07.000 --> 07:39:11.000
do your hands have calluses, rougher smooth feet question mark

07:39:11.000 --> 07:39:15.000
I have what's called hyper hydrosis

07:39:15.000 --> 07:39:19.000
especially in my feet and I do have it in my hands

07:39:19.000 --> 07:39:23.000
which means my hands are always very

07:39:23.000 --> 07:39:27.000
smooth I have no dryness because I am constantly

07:39:27.000 --> 07:39:31.000
wet really

07:39:31.000 --> 07:39:35.000
there's nothing else to go off by but yes I always have like

07:39:35.000 --> 07:39:39.000
kind of moist hands so they're always soft

07:39:39.000 --> 07:39:43.000
my feet are incredibly soft so yeah

07:39:43.000 --> 07:39:47.000
there you go now you know I was actually going to do a donathon reward

07:39:47.000 --> 07:39:51.000
where I give the like for a second and third place

07:39:51.000 --> 07:39:55.000
like thigh highs that I've worn but obviously with my sweaty feet

07:39:55.000 --> 07:39:59.000
constantly they're not like dripping not dripping I don't need

07:39:59.000 --> 07:40:03.000
Botox if you didn't know Botox will paralyze the

07:40:03.000 --> 07:40:07.000
sweat cells but they are constantly

07:40:07.000 --> 07:40:11.000
having like a

07:40:11.000 --> 07:40:15.000
they're not dry put it that way most guys hands are like

07:40:15.000 --> 07:40:19.000
dry so when you go like when you rub your hands together it's like

07:40:19.000 --> 07:40:23.000
but when I rub my hands well when I put my hands together I can fart

07:40:23.000 --> 07:40:27.000
with my hands because they're always clammy and wet and

07:40:27.000 --> 07:40:31.000
yeah that's very true I can always do that

07:40:31.000 --> 07:40:35.000
do it on command I can never find this

07:40:35.000 --> 07:40:39.000
most called flushed that most called flushed

07:40:39.000 --> 07:40:43.000
I can do that breathe it in lads and lasses well you are a cuttlefish

07:40:43.000 --> 07:40:47.000
I'd be concerned if you were tonight you're so talented sweaty hands aren't fun

07:40:47.000 --> 07:40:51.000
yes but it's a little bit annoying especially gaming with a

07:40:51.000 --> 07:40:55.000
controller because of the heat transfer it reflects straight

07:40:55.000 --> 07:40:59.000
back and my hands get very sweaty when I'm using a controller

07:40:59.000 --> 07:41:03.000
fart hands game when your hands are dry just hold Chinese

07:41:03.000 --> 07:41:07.000
I have enough sweat to make your hands nice and soft as well

07:41:07.000 --> 07:41:11.000
okay there's enough to go around I assure you

07:41:21.000 --> 07:41:25.000
don't read this out loud

07:41:27.000 --> 07:41:31.000
oh my god I'm getting intel I'm getting intel

07:41:31.000 --> 07:41:35.000
I know you said you wouldn't ever approach other

07:41:35.000 --> 07:41:39.000
v-tubers but considering the similarity of line of work would you ever consider a collab

07:41:39.000 --> 07:41:43.000
with project melody both of you seem very knowledgeable and passionate about

07:41:43.000 --> 07:41:47.000
positive A in education mental health I feel like you would be great for us

07:41:47.000 --> 07:41:51.000
I would never say no

07:41:51.000 --> 07:41:55.000
but at this point in time you know

07:41:55.000 --> 07:41:59.000
I'm just gonna focus on getting the girls like their achievement stuff

07:41:59.000 --> 07:42:03.000
I would never say no but like to reach out is quite

07:42:03.000 --> 07:42:07.000
you know daunting I'm sure anyone can kind of relate to that kind of

07:42:07.000 --> 07:42:11.000
thing

07:42:11.000 --> 07:42:15.000
yeah I would never say no a lot of people said that

07:42:15.000 --> 07:42:19.000
me and project melody seem to be like

07:42:19.000 --> 07:42:23.000
opposites and yet the same type thing with their kind of care and all that jazz

07:42:23.000 --> 07:42:27.000
reefing intelligent agency since you have hyper hydrolysis

07:42:27.000 --> 07:42:31.000
do you keep yourself well hydrated the way that I can tell

07:42:31.000 --> 07:42:35.000
I'm actually severely dehydrated as my hands go dry

07:42:35.000 --> 07:42:39.000
that's when I know I'm like up

07:42:39.000 --> 07:42:43.000
creek basically as if my hands stop my feet will never

07:42:43.000 --> 07:42:47.000
stop I have never been aware of my feet stopping

07:42:47.000 --> 07:42:51.000
sweating look at me I was always so

07:42:51.000 --> 07:42:55.000
embarrassing as well I don't know if you guys have school dance

07:42:55.000 --> 07:42:59.000
but I used to like rub my hands on my trousers like really quickly before

07:42:59.000 --> 07:43:03.000
like and I'm sure I bet you my dance partner like whoever you got on the

07:43:03.000 --> 07:43:07.000
day felt like I was doing it on purpose like oh boy

07:43:07.000 --> 07:43:11.000
and it's like no I have a really bad sweat problem I don't want anyone to know about

07:43:11.000 --> 07:43:15.000
it he he

07:43:15.000 --> 07:43:19.000
she's just like me for real for real

07:43:19.000 --> 07:43:23.000
your nerdy and yappy and intensively

07:43:23.000 --> 07:43:27.000
he he he

07:43:27.000 --> 07:43:31.000
I've never been to a school dance oh I guess maybe

07:43:31.000 --> 07:43:35.000
not every country does it but we had to learn like

07:43:35.000 --> 07:43:39.000
Scottish traditional dance like the gay garden did you say the gay garden

07:43:39.000 --> 07:43:43.000
yes gay isn't happy ha ha ha we get it we're

07:43:43.000 --> 07:43:47.000
called gay garden which means happy dance

07:43:47.000 --> 07:43:51.000
never been to a school dance can't relate

07:43:51.000 --> 07:43:55.000
I have hyperdologists too so I'm constantly dehydrated

07:43:55.000 --> 07:43:59.000
had school dance here in New Zealand it was similar

07:43:59.000 --> 07:44:03.000
hmm because I hate having to wipe my hands

07:44:03.000 --> 07:44:07.000
hi

07:44:07.000 --> 07:44:11.000
hey strongy question what sort of maros would you hate to receive

07:44:11.000 --> 07:44:15.000
I don't know

07:44:15.000 --> 07:44:19.000
I

07:44:19.000 --> 07:44:23.000
what would I hate to receive

07:44:23.000 --> 07:44:27.000
I don't know nothing really

07:44:27.000 --> 07:44:31.000
I don't know nothing really

07:44:31.000 --> 07:44:35.000
gets me like I can't even think of an example

07:44:35.000 --> 07:44:39.000
I don't know maybe like ask me to finish a game I didn't finish or something

07:44:39.000 --> 07:44:43.000
or be like you suck at this game oh oh my heart you've got

07:44:43.000 --> 07:44:47.000
me I can't believe it I can't believe I didn't finish every single game I've ever started oh you

07:44:47.000 --> 07:44:51.000
call me like I don't I don't know I can't think of an example

07:44:51.000 --> 07:44:55.000
me I think the force this is

07:44:55.000 --> 07:44:59.000
some sad dances at some point in primary middle I went to a school

07:44:59.000 --> 07:45:03.000
dance but there was not a specific dance I had to learn ah never went

07:45:03.000 --> 07:45:07.000
to a dance but always to the after party ooh ballin

07:45:07.000 --> 07:45:11.000
everyone quick tried to get under her skin why would you want under my skin

07:45:11.000 --> 07:45:15.000
you'd rather be

07:45:15.000 --> 07:45:19.000
I would say in it but hold on a minute that doesn't sound right

07:45:19.000 --> 07:45:23.000
well hold on a minute there

07:45:23.000 --> 07:45:27.000
you suck at Skyrim

07:45:27.000 --> 07:45:31.000
when you're gonna finish it oh oh you've got me

07:45:31.000 --> 07:45:35.000
oh tell me how bad I am at the RDA side oh

07:45:35.000 --> 07:45:39.000
oh you've got me I can't believe it right I should probably drink my tea and then we'll jump back

07:45:39.000 --> 07:45:43.000
into Skyrim that's right the tunes are on tunes are on

07:45:43.000 --> 07:45:47.000
mm okay I'm hydrating I'm hydrating

07:45:47.000 --> 07:45:51.000
mm-hmm

07:45:51.000 --> 07:45:55.000
mm-hmm

07:45:55.000 --> 07:45:59.000
she doesn't even know how to chase the RDA oh you've got me I didn't know to put the

07:45:59.000 --> 07:46:03.000
grenade launcher on oh who would have thought

07:46:03.000 --> 07:46:07.000
a grenade launcher

07:46:07.000 --> 07:46:11.000
I can't believe it I'm being I'm being dunked on

07:46:11.000 --> 07:46:15.000
ah

07:46:15.000 --> 07:46:19.000
I would probably say the thing that would genuinely upset me the most

07:46:19.000 --> 07:46:23.000
is if someone sent me something nasty about the daughters

07:46:23.000 --> 07:46:27.000
and obviously if that starts appearing in the inbox

07:46:27.000 --> 07:46:31.000
I know it's like not to pay heed but it's probably the worst thing I can

07:46:31.000 --> 07:46:35.000
imagine but I would then again it was like well you're subjecting me to

07:46:35.000 --> 07:46:39.000
not them so yeah

07:46:39.000 --> 07:46:43.000
that's what it is

07:46:43.000 --> 07:46:47.000
I like how she goes idle she hitting my eyes

07:46:47.000 --> 07:46:51.000
well it's actually for hunting

07:46:51.000 --> 07:46:55.000
but I think it can be used for a distraction

07:46:55.000 --> 07:46:59.000
as well before I ink on you I just ink on you and run away like what you're gonna do

07:46:59.000 --> 07:47:03.000
about it literally before you can even react I'm already gone

07:47:03.000 --> 07:47:07.000
eh

07:47:07.000 --> 07:47:11.000
do you ever play a follow game do you go for stats or stay list oh stats

07:47:11.000 --> 07:47:15.000
I absolutely cannot for the life of me

07:47:15.000 --> 07:47:19.000

07:47:47.000 --> 07:47:51.000

07:48:43.000 --> 07:48:47.000
sell what have you got for sale

07:48:47.000 --> 07:48:51.000
if I could give you a tissue oh no no I just wiped my snot on your hoodie

07:48:51.000 --> 07:48:55.000
I don't need a tissue just give me your hoodie don't be shy

07:48:55.000 --> 07:48:59.000

07:48:59.000 --> 07:49:03.000

alright just use my sleeve she certainly started my thing

07:49:07.000 --> 07:49:11.000
I lost my twin sister a while back

07:49:11.000 --> 07:49:15.000
how did you manage to finish that early

07:49:15.000 --> 07:49:19.000
mmm you know

07:49:19.000 --> 07:49:23.000
guys aren't the only one that might have a bit of the

07:49:23.000 --> 07:49:27.000
preem

07:49:27.000 --> 07:49:31.000
I'm a bit of a fiend for it

07:49:31.000 --> 07:49:35.000
so

07:49:35.000 --> 07:49:39.000
it is what it is I can't get this quest started

07:49:39.000 --> 07:49:43.000
don't want to do that one retrieve the

07:49:43.000 --> 07:49:47.000
sure we can do that we'll go retrieve the glove whilst we get the courier to

07:49:47.000 --> 07:49:51.000
do his thing the glove the horn

07:49:51.000 --> 07:49:55.000
how much would you guys pay for that hoodie

07:49:55.000 --> 07:49:59.000
the convention I'll snot on it for free just bring grass pollen

07:49:59.000 --> 07:50:03.000
or flowers and I'll be sneezing away I'm like really allergic

07:50:03.000 --> 07:50:07.000
to that stuff can't go outside

07:50:07.000 --> 07:50:11.000
which is funny because I have like a seed collection

07:50:11.000 --> 07:50:15.000
which I really enjoy but of course seeds don't have pollen issues on them

07:50:15.000 --> 07:50:19.000
although collecting them sometimes can have traces of pollen but it's not really a big deal

07:50:19.000 --> 07:50:23.000
like if you know what you're doing

07:50:23.000 --> 07:50:27.000
okay okay okay our first dragon

07:50:27.000 --> 07:50:31.000
come land okay it's just a basic dragon

07:50:31.000 --> 07:50:35.000
please land please land

07:50:35.000 --> 07:50:39.000
oh

07:50:39.000 --> 07:50:43.000
of course it resisted soul trap it's a dragon

07:50:43.000 --> 07:50:47.000
I'm the freaking soul gem for the dragon

07:50:47.000 --> 07:50:51.000
I don't know why we're pretending otherwise

07:50:51.000 --> 07:50:55.000
hold on

07:50:55.000 --> 07:50:59.000
I had just emptied like all of my inventory only to pick

07:50:59.000 --> 07:51:03.000
all of that up again

07:51:03.000 --> 07:51:07.000
that was quite a reaction wait what did I do

07:51:07.000 --> 07:51:11.000
did I make a funny seed collection yeah you didn't see my

07:51:11.000 --> 07:51:15.000
stream yesterday I showed off my seed collection I like when I

07:51:15.000 --> 07:51:19.000
were in mud crab down

07:51:19.000 --> 07:51:23.000
I obliterated that dragon's one ankle I know

07:51:23.000 --> 07:51:27.000
I smashed it into dust and he was like okay I'm done I'm done here

07:51:27.000 --> 07:51:31.000
hmm

07:51:31.000 --> 07:51:35.000

07:51:47.000 --> 07:51:51.000
are you nerd about your seeds I can do like an actual informal

07:51:51.000 --> 07:51:55.000
informational stream I think there's four ways of seed dispersal

07:51:55.000 --> 07:51:59.000
air, hook, berry

07:51:59.000 --> 07:52:03.000

07:55:15.000 --> 07:55:19.000
right so I can enchant this possibly

07:55:19.000 --> 07:55:23.000
with soul trap and then give it a

07:55:23.000 --> 07:55:27.000
greater soul gem greater

07:55:27.000 --> 07:55:31.000
and then the other stuff will just shove anything on it

07:55:31.000 --> 07:55:35.000
doesn't really matter as long as we just get some

07:55:35.000 --> 07:55:39.000
XP yeah we're at 44 already

07:55:39.000 --> 07:55:43.000
which is fantastic

07:55:43.000 --> 07:55:47.000
just shoving anything on it

07:55:47.000 --> 07:55:51.000
and these are worth a lot so as our

07:55:51.000 --> 07:55:55.000
speech goes up we get even more money as time goes on

07:55:55.000 --> 07:55:59.000

07:57:47.000 --> 07:57:51.000

08:03:23.000 --> 08:03:27.000
one once was a hero named ragnar the red

08:03:27.000 --> 08:03:31.000
who came riding to white run from horde warwick said

08:03:31.000 --> 08:03:35.000
oh for goodness sakes shush

08:03:35.000 --> 08:03:39.000
there is no possible goal that he made

08:03:39.000 --> 08:03:43.000
but when he went quiet did ragnar the red

08:03:43.000 --> 08:03:47.000
shield maiden Matilda who said

08:03:47.000 --> 08:03:51.000
oh you talk and you lie and you drink or meet

08:03:51.000 --> 08:03:55.000

08:03:55.000 --> 08:03:59.000
slashing of steel is the brave last Matilda

08:03:59.000 --> 08:04:03.000

my friend used that song for one of our classes and got an A

08:04:55.000 --> 08:04:59.000
he yanked it and then submitted it as his own

08:04:59.000 --> 08:05:03.000

08:05:07.000 --> 08:05:11.000
does it matter you're warm dry and still very much alive

08:05:11.000 --> 08:05:15.000
that's more than can be said for old grailard

08:05:15.000 --> 08:05:19.000
oh half of skyrim knows

08:05:19.000 --> 08:05:23.000
old hag gets butchered in her own orphanage things like that

08:05:23.000 --> 08:05:27.000
tend to get around oh but don't misunderstand

08:05:27.000 --> 08:05:31.000
I'm not criticizing it was a good kill old crone had it coming

08:05:31.000 --> 08:05:35.000
and you saved a group of urchins to boot

08:05:35.000 --> 08:05:39.000
but there is a slight

08:05:39.000 --> 08:05:43.000
did we make a oopsie whoopsie a problem

08:05:43.000 --> 08:05:47.000

08:06:11.000 --> 08:06:15.000
um well that's not really important

08:06:15.000 --> 08:06:19.000
here and now that's what matters

08:06:19.000 --> 08:06:23.000

08:06:23.000 --> 08:06:27.000
this room alive but

08:06:27.000 --> 08:06:31.000

08:08:51.000 --> 08:08:55.000
I don't have the time of the patience to be nine

08:08:55.000 --> 08:08:59.000
six children it's me wait no five children

08:08:59.000 --> 08:09:03.000
okay

08:09:03.000 --> 08:09:07.000
and you

08:09:07.000 --> 08:09:11.000
hi yo how's shibi

08:09:11.000 --> 08:09:15.000
we're currently doing the dark brotherhood quest

08:09:15.000 --> 08:09:19.000
maybe you are your own child

08:09:19.000 --> 08:09:23.000
obtainer of goods

08:09:23.000 --> 08:09:27.000
why would you admit that

08:09:27.000 --> 08:09:31.000
and would someone pay to

08:09:31.000 --> 08:09:35.000
have you killed vasha

08:09:35.000 --> 08:09:39.000
come on you can tell me

08:09:39.000 --> 08:09:43.000
we're all friends here

08:09:43.000 --> 08:09:47.000
the real question is would someone pay to have me killed

08:09:47.000 --> 08:09:51.000
again

08:09:51.000 --> 08:09:55.000
8 day goes by without someone trying

08:09:55.000 --> 08:09:59.000
this reminds me of my dungeon

08:09:59.000 --> 08:10:03.000
this place reminds me of the dungeon the blood everywhere and all the cages and things

08:10:03.000 --> 08:10:07.000
right if you don't know who to

08:10:07.000 --> 08:10:11.000
perish I'm gonna show you a trick

08:10:11.000 --> 08:10:15.000
wait am I being dumb

08:10:15.000 --> 08:10:19.000
doesn't that normally cast a path

08:10:19.000 --> 08:10:23.000
am I going crazy

08:10:23.000 --> 08:10:27.000
does that not

08:10:27.000 --> 08:10:31.000
wait I could have sworn if you

08:10:31.000 --> 08:10:35.000
did that it leads to the guy

08:10:35.000 --> 08:10:39.000
turn around

08:10:39.000 --> 08:10:43.000
oh it's just telling me wait is that

08:10:43.000 --> 08:10:47.000

phone hold it right now in your hand hold it in your hand right now

08:10:51.000 --> 08:10:55.000
hold pause

08:10:55.000 --> 08:10:59.000
there that's how you know who you're supposed to kill

08:10:59.000 --> 08:11:03.000
now it doesn't actually matter who you kill as long as someone

08:11:03.000 --> 08:11:07.000
perishes but there you go

08:11:07.000 --> 08:11:11.000
that's how you know who you're

08:11:11.000 --> 08:11:15.000
supposed to perish

08:11:15.000 --> 08:11:19.000
that was sure to have enemies

08:11:19.000 --> 08:11:23.000
remain silent we know we did right

08:11:23.000 --> 08:11:27.000
when most would speak you listen

08:11:27.000 --> 08:11:31.000
you understand that the only thing that matters is you following my orders

08:11:31.000 --> 08:11:35.000
to kill

08:11:35.000 --> 08:11:39.000
you could perish Astrid oh no so I'm free to go

08:11:39.000 --> 08:11:43.000
and you've repaid your debt in full

08:11:43.000 --> 08:11:47.000
but why stop here

08:11:47.000 --> 08:11:51.000

08:11:51.000 --> 08:11:55.000
I would like to officially extend to you

08:11:55.000 --> 08:11:59.000
an invitation to join my family

08:11:59.000 --> 08:12:03.000
in the southwest reaches of Skyrim

08:12:03.000 --> 08:12:07.000
in the pine forest you'll find the entrance to our sanctuary

08:12:07.000 --> 08:12:11.000
it's just beneath the road hidden from view

08:12:11.000 --> 08:12:15.000
silence my brother

08:12:15.000 --> 08:12:19.000

the girlies are winning this one the night

08:15:03.000 --> 08:15:07.000
I'm arranging a job

08:15:07.000 --> 08:15:11.000
but need a bit more time for now

08:15:11.000 --> 08:15:15.000
I forgot about this part of the brotherhood quest line

08:15:15.000 --> 08:15:19.000
soon the night mother will arrive

08:15:19.000 --> 08:15:23.000

08:15:23.000 --> 08:15:27.000
we have to basically

08:15:27.000 --> 08:15:31.000
the armor of the dark brotherhood

08:15:31.000 --> 08:15:35.000
may it serve you well in all your endeavours

08:15:35.000 --> 08:15:39.000
do filter requests

08:15:39.000 --> 08:15:43.000

oh yes have us in shock

08:16:03.000 --> 08:16:07.000
my mom and papa left me all alone

08:16:07.000 --> 08:16:11.000
and I'm so very hungry

08:16:11.000 --> 08:16:15.000
I know a shortcut to the candy shop through the valley

08:16:15.000 --> 08:16:19.000
oh yeah very good very good

08:16:19.000 --> 08:16:23.000
mine is dark down here

08:16:23.000 --> 08:16:27.000
no

08:16:27.000 --> 08:16:31.000
I'm not that tall I'm not that short

08:16:31.000 --> 08:16:35.000
you think I'm that small compared to everyone

08:16:35.000 --> 08:16:39.000
oh yes please old man

08:16:39.000 --> 08:16:43.000
let me see the dark brotherhood can help me

08:16:43.000 --> 08:16:47.000
always mocking the experience

08:16:47.000 --> 08:16:51.000
my contract went very well

08:16:51.000 --> 08:16:55.000
wait I was either the wrong way around

08:16:55.000 --> 08:16:59.000
this close to turning that priest inside out

08:16:59.000 --> 08:17:03.000
damn messy

08:17:03.000 --> 08:17:07.000
what of your latest armbion

08:17:07.000 --> 08:17:11.000
something about a khajiit merchant

08:17:11.000 --> 08:17:15.000
oh a big dog you say something I'm not kidding

08:17:15.000 --> 08:17:19.000
how adorable

08:17:19.000 --> 08:17:23.000
he's even in the workplace

08:17:23.000 --> 08:17:27.000
he wasn't a merchant he was a khajiit monk

08:17:27.000 --> 08:17:31.000
a master of the whispering fang style

08:17:31.000 --> 08:17:35.000
I think it may not be on scale

08:17:35.000 --> 08:17:39.000
workplace bullying

08:17:39.000 --> 08:17:43.000
can't wait to have to go to HR and report all of that

08:17:43.000 --> 08:17:47.000
we learned

08:17:47.000 --> 08:17:51.000
per kill mark of death

08:17:51.000 --> 08:17:55.000
swindling dysfunction

08:17:55.000 --> 08:17:59.000
a little family

08:17:59.000 --> 08:18:03.000
toxic work environment love

08:18:03.000 --> 08:18:07.000

08:18:07.000 --> 08:18:11.000
I wish I had one I'm sorry

08:18:11.000 --> 08:18:15.000
I like to unize you

08:18:15.000 --> 08:18:19.000
but who knows I've been proven wrong before

08:18:19.000 --> 08:18:23.000
Astra said you've got some work for me

08:18:23.000 --> 08:18:27.000
nah?

08:18:27.000 --> 08:18:31.000
loin cloth sniff

08:18:31.000 --> 08:18:35.000
dribbling in from time to time

08:18:35.000 --> 08:18:39.000
wait what you don't have one wait you have one

08:18:39.000 --> 08:18:43.000
since simple enough

08:18:43.000 --> 08:18:47.000
these aren't particularly glamorous assassinations I'll be honest

08:18:47.000 --> 08:18:51.000
don't pay much either but they'll keep you busy

08:18:51.000 --> 08:18:55.000
just do them as you're able there's no real time limit

08:18:55.000 --> 08:18:59.000
the targets aren't going anywhere

08:18:59.000 --> 08:19:03.000
the targets aren't going anywhere

08:19:03.000 --> 08:19:07.000
okay

08:19:07.000 --> 08:19:11.000
okay

08:19:11.000 --> 08:19:15.000
wait so what now

08:19:15.000 --> 08:19:19.000
did you get me them

08:19:19.000 --> 08:19:23.000

08:19:23.000 --> 08:19:27.000
okay thank you thank you thank you stop

08:19:27.000 --> 08:19:31.000
no more talking thank you

08:19:31.000 --> 08:19:35.000
probably gonna miss the end of the stream goodnight

08:19:35.000 --> 08:19:39.000
I am just doing

08:19:39.000 --> 08:19:43.000
be the brotherhood yeah

08:19:43.000 --> 08:19:47.000
and then

08:19:47.000 --> 08:19:51.000
where are you just gonna go to freaking dawn star

08:19:51.000 --> 08:19:55.000
yeah we're not really doing anything

08:19:55.000 --> 08:19:59.000
so please don't worry about going to sleep

08:19:59.000 --> 08:20:03.000
what

08:20:03.000 --> 08:20:07.000
okay

08:20:07.000 --> 08:20:11.000
okay

08:20:11.000 --> 08:20:15.000
wait what does it say

08:20:15.000 --> 08:20:19.000
oh consider adoption wanted a good home

08:20:19.000 --> 08:20:23.000
in these days of born strife the orphans of skyrim are the true victims many have no one left

08:20:23.000 --> 08:20:27.000
to turn to and face the life of hard labour poverty and misery

08:20:27.000 --> 08:20:31.000
if you could provide a stable home from one of these innocent children please consider adoption

08:20:31.000 --> 08:20:35.000
so adopt from us or take in someone closer to home

08:20:35.000 --> 08:20:39.000
you can make a difference in a child's life for more information inquire within

08:20:39.000 --> 08:20:43.000
Constance Michelle Honorary Hall Riften

08:20:43.000 --> 08:20:47.000
okay that is a very nice note she definitely is taking

08:20:47.000 --> 08:20:51.000
care of those children a bit more

08:20:51.000 --> 08:20:55.000
yes we are just going for a cheeky stab

08:20:55.000 --> 08:20:59.000
there should be someone in a tent over here

08:20:59.000 --> 08:21:03.000
um

08:21:03.000 --> 08:21:07.000
I don't know if we could

08:21:07.000 --> 08:21:11.000
I could have sworn you can speak to this person and they recognize you as someone from the dark brotherhood

08:21:11.000 --> 08:21:15.000
but they don't do anything about it I'm like 99% sure

08:21:15.000 --> 08:21:19.000
why are you here get away from me

08:21:19.000 --> 08:21:23.000
you are right to be paranoid

08:21:23.000 --> 08:21:27.000
oh

08:21:27.000 --> 08:21:31.000
oh shit I missed

08:21:31.000 --> 08:21:35.000
wait hold on

08:21:35.000 --> 08:21:39.000
okay maybe I thought he didn't run away

08:21:39.000 --> 08:21:43.000
but I guess he did right how do I get to

08:21:43.000 --> 08:21:47.000
I'll just take I'll just go westward from here

08:21:47.000 --> 08:21:51.000
time to adopt six children for gender oops

08:21:51.000 --> 08:21:55.000
let's not talk about gender

08:21:55.000 --> 08:21:59.000
oh no

08:21:59.000 --> 08:22:03.000
I love that actively

08:22:03.000 --> 08:22:07.000
I love that actively when you talk like when you do stuff in Skyrim

08:22:07.000 --> 08:22:11.000
like the NPCs kind of discuss it I think that's such

08:22:11.000 --> 08:22:15.000
a cool little detail I have to admit for a game for a game

08:22:15.000 --> 08:22:19.000
that came out in 2011 and was produced like before that

08:22:19.000 --> 08:22:23.000
that's pretty that's pretty decent you know

08:22:23.000 --> 08:22:27.000
are you gonna give it to them sometimes can't can't give them all the credit

08:22:27.000 --> 08:22:31.000
but you gotta give it to them sometimes unfortunately I believe we

08:22:31.000 --> 08:22:35.000
do we have to go south no we don't I'm just taking

08:22:35.000 --> 08:22:39.000
super long obnoxious way so I'm going to teleport back

08:22:39.000 --> 08:22:43.000
and then I'm basically just gonna go along the war's edge to get to this dawn star

08:22:43.000 --> 08:22:47.000
death is highly over here

mercy because unfortunately my achievements bugged out so

08:24:47.000 --> 08:24:51.000

08:24:51.000 --> 08:24:55.000
uh run uh man we keep running into Talos

08:24:55.000 --> 08:24:59.000

08:25:31.000 --> 08:25:35.000
Talos no see I'm literally I'm walking into Talos

08:25:35.000 --> 08:25:39.000
with north west so I can't even

08:25:39.000 --> 08:25:43.000
talk I'm getting flustered thinking there's a girl watching me with a

08:25:43.000 --> 08:25:47.000
fuck okay right I'm just going to converse this straight off the bat

08:25:47.000 --> 08:25:51.000
so I used to play Call of Duty and whenever there was like a girl on my team I used to get really

08:25:51.000 --> 08:25:55.000
flustered and I couldn't even talk properly I don't know why I just like completely

08:25:55.000 --> 08:25:59.000
clam up and I'm just like uh uh uh and I just get really like freaking terrible

08:25:59.000 --> 08:26:03.000
about it so it's really I don't know why I still haven't come over

08:26:03.000 --> 08:26:07.000
yet because I played a few rounds of valorant and it happened there was a girl on my team and I

08:26:07.000 --> 08:26:11.000
couldn't speak at all and voice chat and I don't know what it is

08:26:11.000 --> 08:26:15.000
and it's not even like I'm trying to like impress her or anything I just like get all weird

08:26:15.000 --> 08:26:19.000
and like I don't want to bother her you know I'm being weirdo

08:26:19.000 --> 08:26:23.000
I'm like it's not like I'm trying to like

08:26:23.000 --> 08:26:27.000
pick someone up or anything and I'm like freaking Call of Duty I don't know why I get all clammed up

08:26:27.000 --> 08:26:31.000
and it's happening it's literally happening right now in live stream and I'm like oh my god now everyone knows I'm a weirdo

08:26:31.000 --> 08:26:35.000
and I'm like uh I'm freaking talking to wham this hard

08:26:35.000 --> 08:26:39.000
better not better not speaking and starting

08:26:39.000 --> 08:26:43.000
to say bad jokes she's just like the majority of guys

08:26:43.000 --> 08:26:47.000
clamming up like basically every other

08:26:47.000 --> 08:26:51.000
cod player of honestly

08:26:51.000 --> 08:26:55.000
girls are steering

08:26:55.000 --> 08:26:59.000
wait until she really so the reason

08:26:59.000 --> 08:27:03.000
why it feels like it's different for valorant girls is because

08:27:03.000 --> 08:27:07.000
like I'm not trying to

08:27:07.000 --> 08:27:11.000
I'm not like trying to

08:27:11.000 --> 08:27:15.000
you know get anything out of them no that sounds really odd that makes it sound like

08:27:15.000 --> 08:27:19.000
I'm freaking honing in that sounds really odd hold on

08:27:19.000 --> 08:27:23.000
hold on let me think anything

08:27:23.000 --> 08:27:27.000
I can't imagine anything bad happening if we give one person all the power

08:27:27.000 --> 08:27:31.000

scrawny clamming up

08:27:47.000 --> 08:27:51.000
if speaking to women is hard then you sure are very talented at it

08:27:51.000 --> 08:27:55.000
well I'm like freaking my hands are sweating now and I'm getting my

08:27:55.000 --> 08:27:59.000

get me up not detected there is a sanctum here by the way for the don star

08:28:33.000 --> 08:28:37.000
based off of yesterday's stream most of us can probably give you the tip

08:28:37.000 --> 08:28:41.000
honestly didn't you say that your hands are always sweating

08:28:41.000 --> 08:28:45.000
yes but I am I do have physical reactions

08:28:45.000 --> 08:28:49.000
to like stressors and it can make them sweat even more my left hand is currently

08:28:49.000 --> 08:28:53.000
soaked and my right hand I'm like touching my face

08:28:53.000 --> 08:28:57.000
hi

08:28:57.000 --> 08:29:01.000
hi sleigh saber

I can't take anymore I'm losing it

08:29:09.000 --> 08:29:13.000
yes right what was I saying

08:29:13.000 --> 08:29:17.000
right cause the violour girls are like

08:29:17.000 --> 08:29:21.000
it doesn't I don't have any it's not like I'm trying to do anything

08:29:21.000 --> 08:29:25.000
I don't want to sound like I'm prederen

08:29:25.000 --> 08:29:29.000
I can't freaking say a sentence anyway this is Skyrim it's a really good game it came out in 20

08:29:29.000 --> 08:29:33.000
actually came out on November the 11th 2011

08:29:33.000 --> 08:29:37.000
which is release date was 11 11 11 11

08:29:37.000 --> 08:29:41.000
which was really cool little tidbit if you didn't know

08:29:41.000 --> 08:29:45.000
I'm getting absolutely trolled right now

08:29:45.000 --> 08:29:49.000
anyway

08:29:49.000 --> 08:29:53.000
hi what do you want nothing I don't want anything

08:29:57.000 --> 08:30:01.000
wait oh I got bounty added to me that's not good

08:30:01.000 --> 08:30:05.000
that means the guards are always going to come up to me unless I clear the bounty

08:30:05.000 --> 08:30:09.000
could you imagine you could start short

08:30:09.000 --> 08:30:13.000
well that's why the plastic on like the controller in that is really good

08:30:13.000 --> 08:30:17.000
for that issue I got seen

08:30:17.000 --> 08:30:21.000
I fear for the girl refuelling

08:30:21.000 --> 08:30:25.000
oh I see I didn't know you were there

08:30:25.000 --> 08:30:29.000
oh my gosh I see that was terrifying

08:30:29.000 --> 08:30:33.000
weee

08:30:33.000 --> 08:30:37.000
this is the riskiest thing I've ever done do not go down a waterfall

08:30:37.000 --> 08:30:41.000
whatever you do by the way that's a terrible choice right

08:30:41.000 --> 08:30:45.000
can I teleport back to Mazeem

08:30:45.000 --> 08:30:49.000
I can are you still playing on legendary yes I am

08:30:49.000 --> 08:30:53.000
I never was not playing legendary at any point

08:30:53.000 --> 08:30:57.000
I can show you again if you want

08:30:57.000 --> 08:31:01.000
look a little to the left okay it's really cute that you're getting flustered

08:31:01.000 --> 08:31:05.000
over this when every time you speak makes me flustered

08:31:05.000 --> 08:31:09.000
what was I saying

08:31:09.000 --> 08:31:13.000
thank you for the tip Miss Morgan I appreciate it

08:31:13.000 --> 08:31:17.000
what was I showing oh yeah I'm on legendary

08:31:17.000 --> 08:31:21.000
look a little to the left see look see legendary

08:31:21.000 --> 08:31:25.000
I've been on it the entire time

08:31:25.000 --> 08:31:29.000
I don't know why anyone thinks I'm not on legendary for some reason the proof is right on screen right now

08:31:29.000 --> 08:31:33.000
so it's rather odd

08:31:33.000 --> 08:31:37.000
yeah see fair enough yeah

08:31:37.000 --> 08:31:41.000
oh wait hold on oh look a little to the right again

08:31:41.000 --> 08:31:45.000
where am I

08:31:45.000 --> 08:31:49.000
oh I'm still running away from the guards the guards aren't chasing me

08:31:49.000 --> 08:31:53.000
they can be I'm in the middle of a waterfall

08:31:53.000 --> 08:31:57.000
the guards are chasing me

08:31:57.000 --> 08:32:01.000
oh there's an in route let's go get the in route

08:32:01.000 --> 08:32:05.000
thank you for the tip again Miss Morgan

08:32:05.000 --> 08:32:09.000
I never doubt scrawny what you mean me

08:32:09.000 --> 08:32:13.000
they have made legendary for scrawny specifically because the game was too easy

08:32:13.000 --> 08:32:17.000
true true Andrea am I being

08:32:17.000 --> 08:32:21.000
can I just teleport to my location

08:32:21.000 --> 08:32:25.000
so I can progress with my campaign what is shooting bone

08:32:25.000 --> 08:32:29.000
arrows at me is that Lydia is Lydia turned against me too

08:32:29.000 --> 08:32:33.000
get me down the stream I'm a fish I'm actually a fish

08:32:33.000 --> 08:32:37.000
get me this is literally what it looks like from the outside POV

08:32:37.000 --> 08:32:41.000
you're just zooming down the rocks

08:32:41.000 --> 08:32:45.000
can we teleport now

08:32:45.000 --> 08:32:49.000
yes we can

08:32:49.000 --> 08:32:53.000

08:32:53.000 --> 08:32:57.000
well I was going nope not at all

08:32:57.000 --> 08:33:01.000
definitely a MLG gamer

08:33:01.000 --> 08:33:05.000
and she tells you her problems because I'm so good literally I don't know why people seem to struggle

08:33:05.000 --> 08:33:09.000
playing on legendary oh Cicero

08:33:35.000 --> 08:33:39.000
are you squidding me right now

08:33:39.000 --> 08:33:43.000
listen scrawny our Scots accent if one of few benefits of being Scottish

08:33:43.000 --> 08:33:47.000
so use it to your advantage as much as you can

08:33:47.000 --> 08:33:51.000
thank you for the tip Kitsune

08:33:51.000 --> 08:33:55.000
use my Scottish accent to my advantage

08:33:55.000 --> 08:33:59.000
even the night mother are of course welcome here Cicero

08:33:59.000 --> 08:34:03.000
and you will be afforded the respect deserving of your position as keeper

08:34:03.000 --> 08:34:07.000
understood

08:34:07.000 --> 08:34:11.000
I think I may or may not be

08:34:11.000 --> 08:34:15.000
rather submissive at the moment so I can't take a much to say

08:34:15.000 --> 08:34:19.000
oh pardon me

08:34:19.000 --> 08:34:23.000
putting out my weapon in the middle of a cutscene

08:34:23.000 --> 08:34:27.000
I'll be clear on that point

08:34:27.000 --> 08:34:31.000
oh yes mistress perfectly you're the boss

08:34:31.000 --> 08:34:35.000
oh there you are

08:34:35.000 --> 08:34:39.000
I was done speaking with that muttering fool anyway

08:34:39.000 --> 08:34:43.000
we've got business to discuss do you have a contract for me

08:34:43.000 --> 08:34:47.000
is this over for mash

08:34:47.000 --> 08:34:51.000
and speak with the apothecaries assistant

08:34:51.000 --> 08:34:55.000
you'll probably find her in the hags cure when the shoppers

08:34:55.000 --> 08:34:59.000
why does Cicero sound like junk oh why would you say something like that

08:34:59.000 --> 08:35:03.000
my name is Moeery

08:35:03.000 --> 08:35:07.000
rip tie is ready to roll

08:35:07.000 --> 08:35:11.000
I'll let you keep whatever Moeery pays

08:35:11.000 --> 08:35:15.000
ah there you are

08:35:15.000 --> 08:35:19.000
I was done speaking with that muttering fool

08:35:19.000 --> 08:35:23.000
hello hello

08:35:23.000 --> 08:35:27.000
it's good to meet you Cicero

08:35:27.000 --> 08:35:31.000
just keep your distance Jester and we'll get along just fine it's good to meet you

08:35:31.000 --> 08:35:35.000
so polite so nice Cicero likes you

08:35:35.000 --> 08:35:39.000
the night mother is sure to like you too

08:35:39.000 --> 08:35:43.000
oh we're going to be fast friends

08:35:43.000 --> 08:35:47.000
why did you come to the sanctuary Cicero

08:35:47.000 --> 08:35:51.000
the night mother's crypt in Bravil was

08:35:51.000 --> 08:35:55.000
desecrated

08:35:55.000 --> 08:35:59.000
my stripe nowhere there is safe at present

08:35:59.000 --> 08:36:03.000
so Cicero brought our lady to her home

08:36:03.000 --> 08:36:07.000
this is the only sanctuary left in all of Skye River

08:36:07.000 --> 08:36:11.000
you see such was my

08:36:11.000 --> 08:36:15.000
honour as keeper as keeper

08:36:15.000 --> 08:36:19.000
how much did they spend on this freaking voice actor who's he nailed it

08:36:19.000 --> 08:36:23.000
what are your duties of a keeper

08:36:23.000 --> 08:36:27.000
look at yourself Cicero not about the night mother

08:36:27.000 --> 08:36:31.000
or feeling submissive

08:36:31.000 --> 08:36:35.000
you're such a good girl

08:36:35.000 --> 08:36:39.000
thank you

08:36:39.000 --> 08:36:43.000
oh Cicero was just the keeper

08:36:43.000 --> 08:36:47.000
I look at love me

08:36:47.000 --> 08:36:51.000
are you squidding me right now

08:36:51.000 --> 08:36:55.000
would you like me more if I transitioned to a woman

08:36:55.000 --> 08:36:59.000
have you got a pole

08:36:59.000 --> 08:37:03.000
I want the pole if you've got a hole I want the hole

08:37:03.000 --> 08:37:07.000
don't swap

08:37:07.000 --> 08:37:11.000
you don't need a swap

08:37:11.000 --> 08:37:15.000
the words

08:37:19.000 --> 08:37:23.000
the listener what's a listener Cicero

08:37:23.000 --> 08:37:27.000
the listener is the only person the night mother speaks to

08:37:27.000 --> 08:37:31.000
Stroney's an equal opportunist are you squidding me right now

08:37:31.000 --> 08:37:35.000
you dislike Cicero

08:37:35.000 --> 08:37:39.000
oh you don't like his character

08:37:39.000 --> 08:37:43.000
but inside the listener's head

08:37:43.000 --> 08:37:47.000
I hear da but there has not been a listener in years and years

08:37:47.000 --> 08:37:51.000
a lady has not chosen

08:37:51.000 --> 08:37:55.000
I like to dislike Cicero

08:37:55.000 --> 08:37:59.000
but Cicero's like trying to

08:37:59.000 --> 08:38:03.000
stroney's such a good right you're done

08:38:03.000 --> 08:38:07.000
collectively you're done

08:38:07.000 --> 08:38:11.000
I was supposed to hand in the contract so I wasn't paying attention

08:38:11.000 --> 08:38:15.000
thank you for the tip anonymous but no you got a pole keep the pole

08:38:15.000 --> 08:38:19.000
don't be swapping stuff around

08:38:19.000 --> 08:38:23.000
there's a whole other conversation that can come out of that

08:38:23.000 --> 08:38:27.000
but we can't even get into that

08:38:27.000 --> 08:38:31.000
we're going to very slowly hand over

08:38:31.000 --> 08:38:35.000
all the freaking things

08:38:35.000 --> 08:38:39.000
I love watching your long gaming sessions

08:38:39.000 --> 08:38:43.000
that was lovely to be backdrop thank you for the tip I appreciate that

08:38:43.000 --> 08:38:47.000
I'm glad I was worthy

08:38:47.000 --> 08:38:51.000
to wait for after all this time

08:38:51.000 --> 08:38:55.000
it had been a while

08:38:55.000 --> 08:38:59.000
I have to make up for lost time

08:38:59.000 --> 08:39:03.000
why do you want to eat me

08:39:03.000 --> 08:39:07.000
I don't even thought about that

08:39:07.000 --> 08:39:11.000
oh yeah I want to eat calamari

08:39:11.000 --> 08:39:15.000
no you're not supposed to want to eat it

08:39:15.000 --> 08:39:19.000
thank you for the tip pick one

08:39:19.000 --> 08:39:23.000
I like how Lydia just respectfully hangs out

08:39:23.000 --> 08:39:27.000
she's like yeah I'm not going to come in and solve my problem

08:39:27.000 --> 08:39:31.000
thank you I appreciate it

08:39:31.000 --> 08:39:35.000
there was a lot of

08:39:35.000 --> 08:39:39.000
I don't know what the word is

08:39:39.000 --> 08:39:43.000
I suppose emotional turmoil is a bit of a dramatic

08:39:43.000 --> 08:39:47.000
lower

08:39:47.000 --> 08:39:51.000
yeah I'm fine

08:39:51.000 --> 08:39:55.000
he was shouting about the foreign swore

08:39:55.000 --> 08:39:59.000
I think you dropped this

08:39:59.000 --> 08:40:03.000
do you know anything

08:40:03.000 --> 08:40:07.000
hello

08:40:07.000 --> 08:40:11.000
the dark brother has come

08:40:11.000 --> 08:40:15.000
we're here

08:40:15.000 --> 08:40:19.000
I'd prefer it raw like sushi

08:40:19.000 --> 08:40:23.000
we're not supposed to want to eat it

08:40:23.000 --> 08:40:27.000
I'm glad because there was like

08:40:27.000 --> 08:40:31.000
the emotional turmoil and a lot of bad memories came back to the surface

08:40:31.000 --> 08:40:35.000
but they got completely manually overrated

08:40:35.000 --> 08:40:39.000
just because of the love

08:40:39.000 --> 08:40:43.000
and everything that we did

08:40:43.000 --> 08:40:47.000
the girls and I couldn't have predicted anything at all

08:40:47.000 --> 08:40:51.000
it was impossible to predict and we were dealing with

08:40:51.000 --> 08:40:55.000
a major calling at the time which was really messing

08:40:55.000 --> 08:40:59.000
with like how to predict anything at all

08:40:59.000 --> 08:41:03.000
okay but what were we supposed to do with the fish

08:41:03.000 --> 08:41:07.000
I can give explicit detail

08:41:07.000 --> 08:41:11.000
would you like explicit detail

08:41:11.000 --> 08:41:15.000
we love you love you little replay

08:41:15.000 --> 08:41:19.000

08:41:23.000 --> 08:41:27.000
take the dirt

08:41:27.000 --> 08:41:31.000
nice and easy

08:41:31.000 --> 08:41:35.000
wait is there someone here I need to perish

08:41:35.000 --> 08:41:39.000
wait did I read the map wrong

08:41:39.000 --> 08:41:43.000
I think I might have read the map wrong

08:41:43.000 --> 08:41:47.000
you hear about the story of a dude who put a fish in his pants

08:41:47.000 --> 08:41:51.000
no I did not is this bad

08:41:55.000 --> 08:41:59.000
am I supposed to perish her

08:42:03.000 --> 08:42:07.000
she's so messed up are you okay

08:42:07.000 --> 08:42:11.000
wait so why does

08:42:11.000 --> 08:42:15.000
why does she have to be

08:42:15.000 --> 08:42:19.000
cherished if it's optional I'm not actually going to do it because that's really mean

08:42:23.000 --> 08:42:25.000
I have a perfect mean for the situation

08:42:25.000 --> 08:42:29.000
cherish the fish worship the fish for all mortal positions

08:42:29.000 --> 08:42:33.000
no that is nothing

08:42:33.000 --> 08:42:37.000
why are you shooting

08:42:37.000 --> 08:42:41.000
you've just attacked those bandits no wonder they're shooting

08:42:41.000 --> 08:42:45.000
a little to the right

08:42:45.000 --> 08:42:49.000
but I can forfeit the fish best I can forfeit to fish

08:42:49.000 --> 08:42:53.000
no keep it

08:42:53.000 --> 08:42:57.000
no give money to fish unless

08:42:57.000 --> 08:43:01.000
is there even an unless

08:43:01.000 --> 08:43:05.000
I don't even think there's really an unless in that scenario

08:43:05.000 --> 08:43:09.000
it's not that one no it's up here

08:43:09.000 --> 08:43:13.000
I'm not really sure if I'm going to be able to make it to this checkpoint

08:43:13.000 --> 08:43:17.000
because I'm definitely not supposed to be coming up the sheer cliff face

08:43:17.000 --> 08:43:21.000
of a mountain only give money if you can afford it

08:43:21.000 --> 08:43:25.000
but even then I feel like there's so many attachments to it

08:43:25.000 --> 08:43:29.000
and it's like only give it if you're financially stable only give it if you

08:43:29.000 --> 08:43:33.000
are genuinely enjoying the content only give it if

08:43:33.000 --> 08:43:37.000
you know you've treated yourself and

08:43:37.000 --> 08:43:41.000
you've got savings and all that and you're looking after yourself like if you're

08:43:41.000 --> 08:43:45.000
in debt or anything like that no it's a big no no

08:43:45.000 --> 08:43:49.000

give life lesson I will always give life lessons I

08:45:33.000 --> 08:45:37.000
think it's very important to consider

08:45:37.000 --> 08:45:41.000
life experience as an XP bar and when you talk to people and when

08:45:41.000 --> 08:45:45.000
you get to hear other perspectives you are very slowly filling up that bar

08:45:45.000 --> 08:45:49.000
and one a very big life lesson

08:45:49.000 --> 08:45:53.000
can be hold on

08:45:53.000 --> 08:45:57.000

08:46:17.000 --> 08:46:21.000
what just wait until you find the one

08:46:21.000 --> 08:46:25.000
butthole who's just enough XP to level up

08:46:25.000 --> 08:46:29.000
oh no seriously I don't mean talking about

08:46:29.000 --> 08:46:33.000
I can teach you guys about debt and how it works and how credit cards work

08:46:33.000 --> 08:46:37.000
I genuinely believe credit cards are the absolute spawn of

08:46:37.000 --> 08:46:41.000
Satan for lack of better words I absolutely

08:46:41.000 --> 08:46:45.000
they're terrible and once you get sucked into them and you're uneducated in them

08:46:45.000 --> 08:46:49.000
it's like obviously not part of your curriculum surprise surprise

08:46:49.000 --> 08:46:53.000

08:46:53.000 --> 08:46:57.000

08:46:57.000 --> 08:47:01.000
how to do your taxes properly I wonder how you're not told to financially

08:47:01.000 --> 08:47:05.000
gee it's almost like the world runs if people are on debt because of the way

08:47:05.000 --> 08:47:09.000
society is set up because we love capitalism

08:47:09.000 --> 08:47:13.000

08:50:49.000 --> 08:50:53.000
an unchilled

08:50:53.000 --> 08:50:57.000

you punch a hole through the American wall

08:52:37.000 --> 08:52:41.000
the German wall wants you to punch it again then it can break your other hand too

08:52:41.000 --> 08:52:45.000
I don't get it

08:52:45.000 --> 08:52:49.000

she said I am the one I am the one the only one don't need a gun

08:53:45.000 --> 08:53:49.000
to get respect up off the streets

08:53:49.000 --> 08:53:53.000

08:54:09.000 --> 08:54:13.000
my worm simply inks why is he jelly

08:54:13.000 --> 08:54:17.000
wait she said to tell you darkness rises when silence falls

08:54:17.000 --> 08:54:21.000
darkness rises when silence dies

08:54:21.000 --> 08:54:25.000
she said those words

08:54:25.000 --> 08:54:29.000
darkness rises when silence dies

08:54:29.000 --> 08:54:33.000
but those are the words

08:54:33.000 --> 08:54:37.000
German walls are

08:54:37.000 --> 08:54:41.000
25 to 30 centimeters thick

08:54:41.000 --> 08:54:45.000

08:54:57.000 --> 08:55:01.000
she has chosen you

08:55:01.000 --> 08:55:05.000
why did that humming mumbling sound remain me of sea bat

08:55:05.000 --> 08:55:09.000
I'm so sorry I hum it

08:55:09.000 --> 08:55:13.000
tornado alley is a conspiracy theory it's just UFOs stealing houses

08:55:13.000 --> 08:55:17.000
and the night for insurance

08:55:17.000 --> 08:55:21.000

08:55:25.000 --> 08:55:29.000

08:55:29.000 --> 08:55:33.000
I spoke only to the night mother

08:55:33.000 --> 08:55:37.000
I spoke to the night mother but she didn't speak to me

08:55:37.000 --> 08:55:41.000
she's in a little jake he's adorable

08:55:41.000 --> 08:55:45.000
what the listener

08:55:45.000 --> 08:55:49.000
it's true

08:55:49.000 --> 08:55:53.000
the night mother has spoken

08:55:53.000 --> 08:55:57.000
the listener has been chosen

08:55:57.000 --> 08:56:01.000
Cicero's infectious with how happy he is

08:56:01.000 --> 08:56:05.000
Reflings it's chosen it's chosen

08:56:05.000 --> 08:56:09.000
I feel the worst are you alright

08:56:09.000 --> 08:56:13.000
yes I'm fine I don't know what happened so fast yet the band

08:56:13.000 --> 08:56:17.000
Cicero spoke to the night mother but she spoke to you

08:56:17.000 --> 08:56:21.000
is this just more of the fools rambling

08:56:21.000 --> 08:56:25.000
it's true the night Miller spoke to me she said I was the one the only one don't need

08:56:25.000 --> 08:56:29.000
a gun to get respect up off the streets my enemies your enemies

08:56:29.000 --> 08:56:33.000
we wet them off like a canteen

08:56:33.000 --> 08:56:37.000
sorry Cicero wasn't talking to anyone else just the night mother's body

08:56:37.000 --> 08:56:41.000
no to night mother

08:56:41.000 --> 08:56:45.000
I like the scottish version

08:56:45.000 --> 08:56:49.000
I'm the one the only one don't need a gun to get respect up off the streets

08:56:49.000 --> 08:56:53.000
my enemies your enemies we wet them off like a canteen

08:56:53.000 --> 08:56:57.000
yeah you like that

08:56:57.000 --> 08:57:01.000
I hope nothing bad happens to Cicero

08:57:01.000 --> 08:57:05.000
I must speak to someone named Armand

08:57:05.000 --> 08:57:09.000
Motieri

08:57:09.000 --> 08:57:13.000
I have no idea who that is

08:57:13.000 --> 08:57:17.000
that I have heard of and I know where it is

08:57:17.000 --> 08:57:21.000
should I go should I talk to the man

08:57:21.000 --> 08:57:25.000
no no listen

08:57:25.000 --> 08:57:29.000
I don't know what's going on here but you take your orders from me

08:57:29.000 --> 08:57:33.000
I'll be clear on that

08:57:33.000 --> 08:57:37.000
I am still the leader of this family

08:57:37.000 --> 08:57:41.000
you're so easily dismissed

08:57:41.000 --> 08:57:45.000
I need time to think about all this

08:57:45.000 --> 08:57:49.000
go see Nazir do some work for him

08:57:49.000 --> 08:57:53.000
I'll find you when I'm ready to discuss the matter

08:57:53.000 --> 08:57:57.000

Astrid feels the power slipping away

08:58:17.000 --> 08:58:21.000
yeah

08:58:21.000 --> 08:58:25.000

08:58:37.000 --> 08:58:41.000

08:58:41.000 --> 08:58:45.000
I don't know

08:58:45.000 --> 08:58:49.000
wait the listener is serious

08:58:49.000 --> 08:58:53.000

08:58:53.000 --> 08:58:57.000
well of course the night mother will speak to you again

08:58:57.000 --> 08:59:01.000
she might speak now or later or I don't know

08:59:01.000 --> 08:59:05.000
the night mother is part of you now

08:59:05.000 --> 08:59:09.000
I'm not taking my man

08:59:09.000 --> 08:59:13.000

you do be talking a lot those sisters

08:59:41.000 --> 08:59:45.000
I think you're a bigger yapper than me and that's a hard title to

08:59:45.000 --> 08:59:49.000
join off of me hi Nazir

08:59:49.000 --> 08:59:53.000
sorry

08:59:53.000 --> 08:59:57.000
Astrid wanted me to see you about some more work

08:59:57.000 --> 09:00:01.000
what time is it

09:00:01.000 --> 09:00:05.000
oh mercy's on

09:00:05.000 --> 09:00:09.000
positive tunes

09:00:09.000 --> 09:00:13.000

09:00:13.000 --> 09:00:17.000
out with it woman

09:00:17.000 --> 09:00:21.000
I'm going to see if I can fix these achievements

09:00:21.000 --> 09:00:25.000
because there's really not a reason why they shouldn't be working

09:00:25.000 --> 09:00:29.000
whatever tomorrow's stream is going to be

09:00:29.000 --> 09:00:33.000
oh I can hear myself twice go away

09:00:33.000 --> 09:00:37.000

what's she doing advice giving give me your troubles and I'll make them worse

09:00:41.000 --> 09:00:45.000
that's honestly a hilarious concept

09:00:45.000 --> 09:00:49.000
I might be doing that later down the line

09:00:49.000 --> 09:00:53.000
I'm going to see if I can fix my achievements

09:00:53.000 --> 09:00:57.000
that's not really the biggest thing issue ever

09:00:57.000 --> 09:01:01.000
I will be

09:01:01.000 --> 09:01:05.000
tomorrow I will be doing my monetization celebration stream

09:01:05.000 --> 09:01:09.000
do I really have to make it $5

09:01:09.000 --> 09:01:13.000
on the nose I really like the idea

09:01:13.000 --> 09:01:17.000
it was $9.99 to support your wishy-dice but

09:01:17.000 --> 09:01:21.000
why

09:01:21.000 --> 09:01:25.000
oh my god no

09:01:25.000 --> 09:01:29.000
true Seaf Guild master

09:01:29.000 --> 09:01:33.000
thank you for the stream you're more than welcome thank you for hanging and I will redirect

09:01:33.000 --> 09:01:37.000
into mercy

09:01:37.000 --> 09:01:41.000
oh can you do a collab with the girls where you do a

09:01:41.000 --> 09:01:45.000
round of terrible advice that would actually be quite funny I wouldn't mind

09:01:45.000 --> 09:01:49.000
doing that

09:01:49.000 --> 09:01:53.000
my collab is actually power washer sim where you get to see us all together

09:01:53.000 --> 09:01:57.000
because someone not naming names, refling

09:01:57.000 --> 09:02:01.000
guessed the entire reason why we're playing power washer first

09:02:01.000 --> 09:02:05.000
out of all the games of course you had to figure out what the freaking plot was

09:02:05.000 --> 09:02:09.000
but yes

09:02:09.000 --> 09:02:13.000
I will see you giffy givers tomorrow brushing your teeth

09:02:13.000 --> 09:02:17.000
oh I don't have my toothbrush here

09:02:17.000 --> 09:02:21.000
I might like to do it tomorrow

09:02:21.000 --> 09:02:25.000
I'll still work Matty's but we'll do it on stream tomorrow like after the

09:02:25.000 --> 09:02:29.000
the foot part

09:02:29.000 --> 09:02:33.000
but thank you so much for having me thank you for letting me do another

09:02:33.000 --> 09:02:37.000
well it wasn't a fool endurance but it was almost a fool endurance it wasn't too bad

09:02:37.000 --> 09:02:41.000
tomorrow is getting bulldozed

09:02:41.000 --> 09:02:45.000
for monetization celebration so be there or be a square

09:02:45.000 --> 09:02:49.000
I won't be up for too long definitely not an endurance stream

09:02:49.000 --> 09:02:53.000
but please don't worry if you can't make it the void will remain up I will be

09:02:53.000 --> 09:02:57.000
a good girl

09:02:57.000 --> 09:03:01.000
just like you you'll be a good boy won't you

09:03:01.000 --> 09:03:05.000
or a good girl

09:03:05.000 --> 09:03:09.000
yeah only nine over a stream yeah just a little bit

09:03:09.000 --> 09:03:13.000
but yes we will be good together and we don't need to worry

09:03:13.000 --> 09:03:17.000
it should remain up

09:03:17.000 --> 09:03:21.000
and I think that's everything I have to say

09:03:21.000 --> 09:03:25.000
it's possible do we have to stagger our monetization

09:03:25.000 --> 09:03:29.000
celebration days

09:03:29.000 --> 09:03:33.000

she be yeah that's fine if she decides to do hers

09:03:37.000 --> 09:03:41.000
as well because I'm not going to tell her not to do it you know

09:03:41.000 --> 09:03:45.000
I'm not going to say no six hours shaking my head I'm such a fake

09:03:45.000 --> 09:03:49.000
gamer I'm such a rubbish streamer nine hours

09:03:49.000 --> 09:03:53.000

09:03:57.000 --> 09:04:01.000
knees

09:04:01.000 --> 09:04:05.000
for me it's simple okay you

09:04:05.000 --> 09:04:09.000
behave you get rewarded

09:04:09.000 --> 09:04:13.000
fair and simple exchange

09:04:13.000 --> 09:04:17.000
oh you do have to go to 599 to avoid gifting

09:04:17.000 --> 09:04:21.000
you're joking please tell me you're trolling me

09:04:21.000 --> 09:04:25.000
and it's not 599

09:04:25.000 --> 09:04:29.000
is it actually 599

09:04:29.000 --> 09:04:33.000
I don't think I can charge that much that's not fair

09:04:33.000 --> 09:04:37.000
mmm

09:04:37.000 --> 09:04:41.000
mmm

09:04:41.000 --> 09:04:45.000
why did gifting change does gifting not go to the lowest here

09:04:45.000 --> 09:04:49.000
are we sure gifting doesn't do the lowest here

09:04:49.000 --> 09:04:53.000
what's gifting so when someone is monetized

09:04:53.000 --> 09:04:57.000
you can gift membership to other people and

09:04:57.000 --> 09:05:01.000
um

09:05:01.000 --> 09:05:05.000
I specifically am having you know what

09:05:05.000 --> 09:05:09.000
we could test it on me

09:05:09.000 --> 09:05:13.000
we could test it on me tomorrow

09:05:13.000 --> 09:05:17.000
I know how to um dance the line

09:05:17.000 --> 09:05:21.000
okay we'll test it on me tomorrow we'll see

09:05:21.000 --> 09:05:25.000
what happens strongy street spot oh English strongy

09:05:25.000 --> 09:05:29.000
speaks and my heart becomes weak 100% sure it doesn't

09:05:29.000 --> 09:05:33.000
seen tons of channels with 199 split

09:05:33.000 --> 09:05:37.000
let me let me cook

09:05:37.000 --> 09:05:41.000
and I'll put the price that I want and I think it's fair and we'll see what happens

09:05:41.000 --> 09:05:45.000
and if it's just an absolute cluster minuster then

09:05:45.000 --> 09:05:49.000
we'll deal with a fallout on me at least and then the girls are unaffected

09:05:49.000 --> 09:05:53.000
by any fallout

09:05:53.000 --> 09:05:57.000
the fear of a thingy but I've never seen it happen

09:05:57.000 --> 09:06:01.000
nah and it's like

09:06:01.000 --> 09:06:05.000
I have to turn on being able to be gifted yes I would put it on because it's a big

09:06:05.000 --> 09:06:09.000
income source and I have terrible news

09:06:09.000 --> 09:06:13.000
I spent a lot of money

09:06:13.000 --> 09:06:17.000
yeah failure wasn't cheap let's put it that way

09:06:17.000 --> 09:06:21.000
yes not even fallout in new vegas

09:06:21.000 --> 09:06:25.000
what about fallout in new vegas

09:06:25.000 --> 09:06:29.000
I've seen 399 and 799 that's rubbish

09:06:29.000 --> 09:06:33.000
if they use it they have to turn on being able to receive gifts

09:06:33.000 --> 09:06:37.000
ok ok well that's a team effort

09:06:37.000 --> 09:06:41.000
just a wee bit of money just a wee bit of pocket money

09:06:41.000 --> 09:06:45.000
if so well

09:06:45.000 --> 09:06:49.000
I will let you be carried away

09:06:49.000 --> 09:06:53.000
to mercy gently well she gives you terrible advice

09:06:53.000 --> 09:06:57.000
and we'll take it from tomorrow

09:06:57.000 --> 09:07:01.000
and see if we

09:07:01.000 --> 09:07:05.000
are able to make everything run smoothly

09:07:05.000 --> 09:07:09.000
